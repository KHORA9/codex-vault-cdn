NEW-YORK, SEPTEMBER 1, 1851. No. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTITUTIONS FOR SAILORS, IN NEW-YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEALTH-OFFICER BOARDING AN IMMIGRANT SHIP, QUARANTINE,\r\nSTATEN ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe maritime commerce of New-York has increased so rapidly that it has\r\ncontinually outgrown the space appropriated for its accommodation, so\r\nthat the docks, wharves, warehouses, and landings, have been found\r\nwholly inadequate to the reception of the business which has poured in\r\nupon them. But the benevolent institutions of the \"Empire City,\"\r\ndesigned to meliorate the condition of sea-faring men, have been fully\r\nequal to the exigencies of this improvident class of laborers, and are\r\namong the noblest and best conducted of the many charitable\r\ninstitutions in this great and growing metropolis of the New World.\r\nCommerce is the life and soul of New-York, and the most selfish\r\nmotives should lead to the establishment of suitable retreats and\r\nhospitals for the benefit of the class of men without whose labors its\r\nwheels could not revolve; but it is not to those who are most\r\nbenefited by the labors of seamen that they are indebted for the\r\nexistence of safe havens of retreat, where they may cast anchor in\r\nrepose, where they can no longer follow their dangerous and\r\nstorm-tost business. Seamen are the only class who have asylums\r\nprovided expressly for their use, either in sickness or old age. The\r\nnation provides no hospital like that of Greenwich, where the tars who\r\nare disabled in the public service find a home and an honorable\r\nsupport, but it lays a capitation tax on all the seamen in the navy\r\nfor the creation of a fund, out of which the Naval Asylum, the\r\nWallabout Hospital, &c., for the disabled, invalid, and superannuated\r\nof the navy have, at their own cost, not altogether disagreeable\r\nhomes. New-York, however, from the munificence of private individuals\r\nand the creation of a fund from a tax on seamen, can boast of\r\nexcellent institutions for the ample and comfortable accommodation of\r\nall the sick and infirm sailors who have earned a right of admission\r\nby sailing from this port. In this respect there is no other city in\r\nthe world that can equal New-York.\r\n\r\nThe quarantine ground of the port of New-York, which is on the\r\nnorth-eastern point of Staten Island, five and a half miles from the\r\nBattery, is admirably located for the purposes of purification, and\r\nliberally endowed with all the necessary means for the cure of the\r\nsick and the prevention of the spread of disease. The ground\r\nappropriated for the purposes of a lazaretto has a frontage on the bay\r\nof about fourteen hundred feet, and extends back twelve hundred feet.\r\nIt is inclosed by a high brick wall, and includes suitable hospitals\r\nfor the accommodation of the sick, houses for the resident physician,\r\nand offices for the numerous persons employed about the grounds. The\r\nlargest hospital, appropriated for fever patients, is that nearest the\r\nwater. It is constructed of brick, is three stories high, and one\r\nhundred and thirty-six feet long by twenty-eight feet wide. The\r\nbuilding on the rising ground next above this is intended for\r\nconvalescents. It is built of brick, three stories high, fifty feet\r\nlong, and forty-five feet high, with two wings sixty-six by twenty-six\r\nfeet each. Higher up, beyond this, is the small-pox hospital, which\r\ngenerally has the largest number of patients. It is but two stories,\r\neighty feet long and twenty-eight feet wide; like the other hospitals,\r\nit is built of brick, and has open galleries on the outside, in front,\r\nand rear. The quarantine hospitals, although forming no unimportant\r\npart of the maritime institutions of New-York, do not properly come\r\nunder the head of those denominated benevolent, as they are merely\r\nsanitary and for the purpose of preventing the spread of contagious\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SEAMEN'S RETREAT.]\r\n\r\nThe Seamen's Retreat is also on Staten Island, a mile below the\r\nquarantine ground, built upon a natural terrace, about one hundred\r\nfeet above the water, and fronting the Narrows. The location is one of\r\nexceeding beauty, being surrounded by sylvan scenery of unsurpassed\r\nloveliness, and commanding a prospect of great extent, which embraces\r\nthe city, the shore of New Jersey, the Palisades, Long Island, and the\r\nhighlands of Neversink and Sandy Hook. The Hospital is a noble\r\nbuilding, constructed of rough granite, three stories high, and\r\nsurrounded by piazzas, upon which the patients may inhale the pure\r\nair, and beguile their confinement by watching the ever-changing\r\npanorama presented by the bay, with its countless ships and steamers.\r\nThe Retreat is intended solely for sick but not disabled seamen. It is\r\nsupported by a fund derived from a state capitation tax, levied upon\r\nall seamen sailing from this port, and is the only establishment of\r\nthe kind in the United States, or, we believe, in the world. Seamen\r\nare the only class who are compelled by the law of the state to\r\ncontribute to a fund to form a provision for them in case of sickness.\r\nThe income for the support of the Retreat is ample, and the most\r\nliberal provision is allowed for all whose necessities compel them to\r\nseek admission. On the grounds are houses for the residence of the\r\nphysician and keeper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAILOR'S SNUG HARBOR.]\r\n\r\nThis noble Charity is situated on the north side of Staten Island,\r\nabout three miles from the Quarantine, and commands a magnificent\r\nview, with the city in the distance. It is surrounded with elegant\r\nvillas, pretty cottages, and well cultivated farms, and is in the\r\nmidst of the loveliest rural scenery that the neighborhood of New-York\r\ncan boast of. The grounds belonging to the institution comprise about\r\none hundred and sixty acres of land, which is inclosed by a handsome\r\niron fence that cost, a few years since, thirty-five thousand dollars.\r\nThe principal building is constructed of brick and faced with white\r\nmarble, with a marble portico. The corner-stone was laid in 1831, and\r\nthe institution opened for the reception of its inmates in 1833. The\r\ncentre building is sixty-five by one hundred feet, with two wings\r\nfifty-one by one hundred feet, connected with the main building by\r\ncorridors. There are two handsome houses for the residences of the\r\ngovernor of the institution, and the physician, and numerous offices\r\nand outhouses.\r\n\r\nThis noble institution owes its existence to Captain James Randall,\r\nwho, in the year 1801, bequeathed a piece of land in the upper part of\r\nthe city, for the foundation of a retreat for worn-out seamen, who had\r\nsailed from the port of New-York; it was called most appropriately the\r\nSNUG HARBOR, and many a poor mariner has since found safe moorings\r\nthere, when no longer able to follow his perilous calling. The\r\nbenevolent-hearted sailor who founded this noble charity could hardly\r\nhave dreamed that the small property which he bequeathed for that\r\npurpose, could ever increase to the magnificent sum which it is now\r\nvalued at. The income from the estate in the year 1806 was but a\r\nlittle more than four thousand dollars; it is now thirty-seven\r\nthousand dollars, and will be, next year, when the leases of the\r\nproperty have to be renewed, at least sixty thousand dollars a year,\r\nan income abundantly large to support even in luxurious comfort the\r\nworn-out tars who may be compelled by misfortune to seek this\r\nmagnificent asylum. The trustees of the Snug Harbor are about to build\r\nextensive additions to the present accommodations for it inmates, and\r\namong the new buildings will be a hospital for the insane. There is no\r\nchapel attached to the Snug Harbor, but there is a regular chaplain\r\nwho performs religious services every Sunday in the large hall in the\r\ncentre building.\r\n\r\nIn front of the principal edifice a plain monument of white marble has\r\nbeen erected by the trustees in memory of Captain Randall, the founder\r\nof the institution, which is chiefly remarkable for the omission, in\r\nthe inscription, of any information respecting the birth or death of\r\nthe person in whose honor it was erected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAILOR'S HOME.]\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that New-York has originated every system\r\nfor bettering the temporal and spiritual condition of seamen, that now\r\nexists, and furnished the models of the various institutions for the\r\nbenefit of sea-faring men which have been successfully copied in other\r\nmaritime cities of the new and the old world. It was here that the\r\nfirst chapel was built for the exclusive use of sailors and their\r\nfamilies, the Mariner's chapel in Roosevelt-street; and it was here,\r\ntoo, that the first Home was erected for the residence, while on\r\nshore, of homeless sailors. The corner-stone of the Home in\r\nCherry-street was laid with appropriate ceremonies on the 14th of\r\nOctober, 1841, just twenty-two years from the day on which the\r\ncorner-stone of the Mariner's chapel was laid in Roosevelt-street. The\r\nbuilding is a well constructed house of brick with a granite basement,\r\nplain and substantial, without any pretensions to architectural\r\nornamentation. It is six stories high, fifty feet front, and one\r\nhundred and sixty feet deep. It contains one hundred and thirty\r\nsleeping-rooms, a dining-room one hundred by twenty-five feet, and a\r\nspacious reading-room, in which are a well selected library, and a\r\nmuseum of natural curiosities; there are also suitable apartments for\r\nthe overseer and officers. About five hundred boarders can be\r\naccommodated in the Home, but it is not often filled. The Sailor's\r\nHome was built by the Seaman's Friend Society, and is intended to\r\nfurnish sailors with a comfortable and orderly home, where they will\r\nnot be subject to the rapacities of unprincipled landlords, nor the\r\ntemptations which usually beset this useful but improvident class of\r\nmen when they are on shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U.S. MARINE HOSPITAL, BROOKLYN.]\r\n\r\nThe Marine Hospital at the Wallabout, Brooklyn, near the Navy Yard,\r\nbelongs to the government of the United States, and is intended for\r\nthe use of the sailors and officers of the navy, and none others. It\r\nwas built from a fund called the hospital fund, which is created by a\r\npayment of twenty cents a month by all the officers and seamen of the\r\nnavy. The Hospital stands on high ground, on one of the healthiest and\r\npleasantest spots in the vicinity of New-York, commands a superb view\r\nof the East River as it sweeps toward the Sound, and overlooks both\r\nBrooklyn and New-York. The buildings constituting the Hospital are two\r\nfine large airy edifices constructed of white marble, with galleries\r\nand piazzas, and surrounded by well-kept grounds which abound with\r\nchoice fruit trees, and every requisite for the health and comfort of\r\nthe invalids. The patients remain there only while under treatment for\r\ndisease. Our government has no asylum for the support of the sailors\r\nor soldiers who lose their health or limbs in its service, like the\r\nhospitals of Greenwich and Chelsea, and, in this respect at least, we\r\nare behind the government of Great Britain, which makes ample and\r\ngenerous provision for all classes and grades of public servants.\r\n\r\nAs New-York was the first maritime city that built a chapel expressly\r\nfor seamen, so it was the first to build a floating church, for\r\nalthough there had been previously in London and Liverpool old hulks\r\nfitted up as chapels, and moored in the docks for the use of sailors,\r\nthere had never been an actual church edifice put afloat before the\r\nFLOATING CHURCH OF OUR SAVIOUR, which now lies moored at the foot of\r\nPike-street, in the East River. This novel edifice was finished and\r\nconsecrated in February, 1844. It is under the charge of the Young\r\nMen's Church Missionary Society of the City of New-York, by whom it\r\nwas built, and has been under the pastoral care of the Rev. B. C. C.\r\nParker, of the Episcopal church, from its consecration to the present\r\ntime. It is seventy feet long, and thirty feet wide, and will\r\ncomfortably seat five hundred persons. It has an end gallery, in which\r\nis an organ. A beautiful baptismal font of white marble, in the shape\r\nof a capstan, surmounted by a seashell, chiselled from the same block\r\nwith the shaft--the gift of St. Mark's church in the Bowery,\r\nNew-York--stands in front of the chancel rail. The top of the\r\ncommunion-table is a marble slab, and the Ten Commandments are placed\r\non the panels on each side in the recess over it. An anchor in gold,\r\npainted on the back-ground between these panels, rests upon the Bible\r\nand prayer-book. The roof, at the apex, is twenty-six feet high, and\r\neleven feet at the eaves. The edifice is built on a broad deck,\r\nseventy-six by thirty-six feet, covering two boats of eighty tons\r\neach, placed ten feet apart. The spire contains a bell, and the top of\r\nthe flag-staff is about seventy feet from the deck. Divine service is\r\nregularly performed on Sundays, commencing in the morning at half-past\r\nten, and in the afternoon at three o'clock. Both the boats on which\r\nthe edifice rests are well coppered, and protected from injury by\r\nbooms placed around them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLOATING CHURCH OF OUR SAVIOUR.]\r\n\r\nA similar floating church has been built and moored near\r\nRector-street, in the North River, near which is another floating\r\nchapel, formed of an old hulk, after the manner of the first floating\r\nchapels in London. In addition to these houses of worship for seamen,\r\nthere is a large and handsome church for sailors near the \"Home,\" in\r\nCherry-street, under the charge of the Baptists, and a small seamen's\r\nchapel in Brooklyn, near the Catharine Ferry. To complete this system\r\nof benevolent enterprises for the benefit of sailors, there is a\r\nSeaman's Savings Bank in Wall-street, a very handsome structure of\r\nbrown free-stone, in the third story of which are the offices of the\r\nSeaman's Friend Society.\r\n\r\nIn Franklin Square, which, at the time of Washington's last visit to\r\nNew-York, bore about the same relation to the heart of the city that\r\nUnion Square and Grammercy Park now do, being the Ultima Thule of\r\nfashion, and the very focus of gentility and aristocracy, there is the\r\nSailor's Home for colored seamen, which has been most respectably\r\nconducted on the principle of the \"Home\" in Cherry-street, and under\r\nthe supervision of, although not belonging to, the Seaman's Friend\r\nSociety. The Colored Home consists of two respectable three-story\r\nbrick buildings, and is next door to the old Walton House, which is\r\nthe last remnant of ante-revolutionary splendor remaining in the\r\ncommercial metropolis of the Union, which once abounded in stately old\r\nmansions full of historical mementoes of the days when we acknowledged\r\nto kingly authority.\r\n\r\nThe principle of compelling men, when they have means, to lay up a\r\ntrifle against the exigencies of a rainy day, has worked well, as we\r\nhave seen, when applied to the most improvident of all the laboring\r\nclasses, and we are not sure but the same principle applied to other\r\nclasses would not prove equally beneficial. If the law should require\r\nevery author, or merchant, or broker, or editor, to pay a monthly\r\nstipend to provide houses of refuge for the needy of their class, it\r\nwould be only carrying out the principle of government which has been\r\napplied to seamen, and might save many a poor wretch from committing\r\nsuicide to avoid the fate of a pauper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CUB OF THE BARN-YARD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL LIFE IN VIRGINIA: THE \"SWALLOW BARN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe remember no book of its class altogether more delightful than the\r\n\"Swallow Barn\" of JOHN P. KENNEDY. In Irving's \"Bracebridge Hall\" we\r\nhave exquisite sketches of English homes, such sketches as could be\r\ndrawn only by that graceful and genial humorist, but Bracebridge Hall\r\nis not in our own country, and we scarcely feel \"at our own\" in it, as\r\nwe do in every scene to which we are introduced by the author of\r\n\"Swallow Barn,\" the best painter of manners who has ever tried his\r\nhand at their delineation in America. The love of nature, the fine\r\nappreciation of a country life, the delicate and quiet humor, and\r\nhearty joy in every one's enjoyment, which those who know Mr. Kennedy\r\npersonally will recognize as principal elements of his own character,\r\nare reflected in the pages of the book, and with its other good\r\nqualities make it one of the most charming compositions in the\r\nliterature of the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. Putnam in a few days will publish a new edition of \"Swallow Barn,\"\r\nprofusely illustrated by Mr. Strother, an artist who seems perfectly\r\nat home in the Old Dominion, as if--which may be the case--all his\r\nlife had been spent there. Some of these we shall transfer to our own\r\npages, but first we copy in full Mr. Kennedy's \"Word in Advance to the\r\nReader\":\r\n\r\n     \"Swallow Barn was written twenty years ago, and was\r\n     published in a small edition, which was soon exhausted. From\r\n     that date it has disappeared from the bookstores, being\r\n     carelessly consigned by the author to that oblivion which is\r\n     common to books and men--out of sight, out of mind. Upon a\r\n     recent reviewal of it, after an interval sufficiently long\r\n     to obliterate the partialities with which one is apt to\r\n     regard his own productions, I have thought it was worthy of\r\n     more attention than I had bestowed upon it, and was, at\r\n     least, entitled to the benefit of a second edition. In\r\n     truth, its republication has been so often advised by\r\n     friends, and its original reception was so prosperous, that\r\n     I have almost felt it to be a duty once more to set it\r\n     afloat upon the waters, for the behoof of that good-natured\r\n     company of idle readers who are always ready to embark on a\r\n     pleasure excursion in any light craft that offers. I have,\r\n     therefore, taken these volumes in hand, and given them a\r\n     somewhat critical revisal. Twenty years work sufficient\r\n     change upon the mind of an author to render him, perhaps\r\n     more than others, a fastidious critic of his own book. If\r\n     the physiologists are right, he is not the same person after\r\n     that lapse of time; and all that his present and former self\r\n     may claim in common, are those properties which belong to\r\n     his mental consciousness, of which his aspiration after fame\r\n     is one. The present self may, therefore, be expected to\r\n     examine more rigorously the work of that former and younger\r\n     person, for whom he is held responsible. This weighty\r\n     consideration will be sufficient to account for the few\r\n     differences which may be found between this and the first\r\n     edition. Some quaintness of the vocabulary has been got rid\r\n     of--some dialogue has been stript of its redundancy--some\r\n     few thoughts have been added--and others retrenched. I shall\r\n     be happy to think that the reader will agree with me that\r\n     these are improvements:--I mean the reader who may happen to\r\n     belong to that small and choice corps who read these volumes\r\n     long ago--a little troop of friends of both sexes, to whom I\r\n     have reason to be grateful for that modicum of good opinion\r\n     which cheered my first authorship. Health and joy to them\r\n     all--as many as are now alive! I owe them a thanksgiving for\r\n     their early benevolence.\r\n\r\n     \"Swallow Barn exhibits a picture of country life in\r\n     Virginia, as it existed in the first quarter of the present\r\n     century. Between that period and the present day, time and\r\n     what is called \"the progress,\" have made many innovations\r\n     there, as they have done every where else. The Old Dominion\r\n     is losing somewhat of the raciness of her once peculiar,\r\n     and--speaking in reference to the locality described in\r\n     these volumes--insulated cast of manners. The mellow, bland,\r\n     and sunny luxuriance of her home society--its good\r\n     fellowship, its hearty and constitutional\r\n     _companionableness_, the thriftless gayety of the people,\r\n     their dogged but amiable invincibility of opinion, and that\r\n     overflowing hospitality which knew no ebb--these traits,\r\n     though far from being impaired, are modified at the present\r\n     day by circumstances which have been gradually attaining a\r\n     marked influence over social life as well as political\r\n     relation. An observer cannot fail to note that the manners\r\n     of our country have been tending towards a uniformity which\r\n     is visibly effacing all local differences. The old states,\r\n     especially, are losing their original distinctive habits and\r\n     modes of life, and in the same degree, I fear, are losing\r\n     their exclusive American character. A traveller may detect\r\n     but few sectional or provincial varieties in the general\r\n     observances and customs of society, in comparison with what\r\n     were observable in the past generations, and the pride, or\r\n     rather the vanity, of the present day is leading us into a\r\n     very notable assimilation with foreign usages. The country\r\n     now apes the city in what is supposed to be the elegancies\r\n     of life, and the city is inclined to value and adopt the\r\n     fashions it is able to import across the Atlantic, and thus\r\n     the whole surface of society is exhibiting the traces of a\r\n     process by which it is likely to be rubbed down, in time, to\r\n     one level, and varnished with the same gloss. It may thus\r\n     finally arrive at a comfortable insipidity of character\r\n     which may not be willingly reckoned as altogether a due\r\n     compensation for the loss of that rough but pleasant flavor\r\n     which belonged to it in its earlier era. There is much good\r\n     sense in that opinion which ascribes a wholesome influence\r\n     to those homebred customs, which are said to strengthen\r\n     local attachments and expand them into love of country. What\r\n     belonged to us as characteristically American, seems already\r\n     to be dissolving into a mixture which affects us\r\n     unpleasantly as a plain and cosmopolitan substitute for the\r\n     old warmth and salient vivacity of our ancestors. We no\r\n     longer present in our pictures of domestic life so much as\r\n     an earnest lover of our nationality might desire of what\r\n     abroad is called the \"red bird's wing\"--something which\r\n     belongs to us and to no one else. The fruitfulness of modern\r\n     invention in the arts of life, the general fusion of thought\r\n     through the medium of an extra-territorial literature, which\r\n     from its easy domestication among us is scarcely regarded as\r\n     foreign, the convenience and comfort of European customs\r\n     which have been incorporated into our scheme of living,--all\r\n     these, aided and diffused by our extraordinary facilities of\r\n     travel and circulation, have made sad work, even in the\r\n     present generation, with those old _nationalisms_ that were\r\n     so agreeable to the contemplation of an admirer of the\r\n     picturesque in character and manners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"SWALLOW BARN.\"]\r\n\r\n     \"Looking myself somewhat hopelessly upon this onward gliding\r\n     of the stream, I am not willing to allow these sketches of\r\n     mine entirely to pass away. They have already begun to\r\n     assume the tints of a relic of the past, and may, in another\r\n     generation, become archaeological, and sink into the chapter\r\n     of antiquities. Presenting, as I make bold to say, a\r\n     faithful picture of the people, the modes of life, and the\r\n     scenery of a region full of attraction, and exhibiting the\r\n     lights and shades of its society with the truthfulness of a\r\n     painter who has studied his subject on the spot, they may\r\n     reasonably claim their accuracy of delineation to be set off\r\n     as an extenuation for any want of skill or defect of finish\r\n     which a fair criticism may charge against the artist. Like\r\n     some sign-post painters, I profess to make a strong\r\n     likeness, even if it should be thought to be _hard_,--and\r\n     what better workmen might call a daub,--as to which I must\r\n     leave my reader to judge for himself when he has read this\r\n     book. The outward public award on this point was kind, and\r\n     bestowed quite as much praise as I could have desired--much\r\n     more than I expected--when the former edition appeared. But\r\n     \"the progress\" has brought out many competitors since that\r\n     day, and has, perhaps, rendered the public taste more\r\n     scrupulous. A book then was not so perilous an offering as\r\n     it is now in the great swarm of authorships. We run more\r\n     risk, just now, of being left alone--unread--untalked\r\n     of--though not, happily, unpuffed by newspapers, who are\r\n     favorites with the publisher, and owe him courtesies.\r\n\r\n     \"I wish it to be noted that Swallow Barn is not a novel. I\r\n     confess this in advance, although I may lose by it. It was\r\n     begun on the plan of a series of detached sketches linked\r\n     together by the hooks and eyes of a traveller's notes; and\r\n     although the narrative does run into some by-paths of\r\n     personal adventure, it has still preserved its desultory,\r\n     sketchy character to the last. It is, therefore, utterly\r\n     unartistic in plot and structure, and may be described as\r\n     variously and interchangeably partaking of the complexion of\r\n     a book of travels, a diary, a collection of letters, a\r\n     drama, and a history,--and this, serial or compact, as the\r\n     reader may choose to compute it. Our old friend Polonius had\r\n     nearly hit it in his rigmarole of 'pastoral-comical,\r\n     tragical-comical-historical-pastoral'--which, saving 'the\r\n     tragical,' may well make up my schedule: and so I leave it\r\n     to the 'censure' of my new reader.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIRGINIA MILL-BOYS RACING.]\r\n\r\nHere the history of the book is admirably told. The work itself, so\r\nfull of truthful and effective pictures, offers numerous passages for\r\nquotation, but though we have nothing better to give our readers, we\r\nshall limit our extracts to a few scenes illustrated by Mr. Strother's\r\npencil. We present first the old barn itself.\r\n\r\n     \"Beyond the bridge, at some distance, stands a prominent\r\n     object in the perspective of this picture,--the most\r\n     venerable appendage to the establishment--a huge barn with\r\n     an immense roof hanging almost to the ground, and thatched a\r\n     foot thick with sunburnt straw, which reaches below the\r\n     eaves in ragged flakes. It has a singularly drowsy and\r\n     decrepit aspect. The yard around it is strewed knee-deep\r\n     with litter, from the midst of which arises a long rack\r\n     resembling a chevaux de frise, which is ordinarily filled\r\n     with fodder. This is the customary lounge of half a score of\r\n     oxen and as many cows, who sustain an imperturbable\r\n     companionship with a sickly wagon, whose parched tongue and\r\n     drooping swingle-trees, as it stands in the sun, give it a\r\n     most forlorn and invalid character; whilst some sociable\r\n     carts under the sheds, with their shafts perched against the\r\n     walls, suggest the idea of a set of gossiping cronies taking\r\n     their ease in a tavern porch. Now and then a clownish\r\n     hobble-de-hoy colt, with long fetlocks and disordered mane,\r\n     and a thousand burs in his tail, stalks through this\r\n     company. But as it is forbidden ground to all his tribe, he\r\n     is likely very soon to encounter a shower of corn-cobs from\r\n     some of the negro men; upon which contingency he makes a\r\n     rapid retreat across the bars which imperfectly guard the\r\n     entrance to the yard, and with an uncouth display of his\r\n     heels bounds towards the brook, where he stops and looks\r\n     back with a saucy defiance; and after affecting to drink for\r\n     a moment, gallops away with a braggart whinny to the\r\n     fields.\"\r\n\r\nThe life led by the young negroes on the plantations of Virginia is\r\ngenerally easy, and of course utterly free from the cares which beset\r\ntheir youthful masters, compelled to pore over \"miserable books.\"\r\n\r\n     \"There is a numerous herd of little negroes about the\r\n     estate; and these sometimes afford us a new diversion. A few\r\n     mornings since we encountered a horde of them, who were\r\n     darting about the bushes like untamed monkeys. They are\r\n     afraid of me because I am a stranger, and take to their\r\n     heels as soon as they see me. If I ever chance to get near\r\n     enough to speak to one of them, he stares at me with a\r\n     suspicious gaze, and, after a moment, makes off at full\r\n     speed, very much frightened, towards the cabins at some\r\n     distance from the house. They are almost all clad in a long\r\n     coarse shirt which reaches below the knee, without any other\r\n     garment. But one of the group we met on the morning I speak\r\n     of, was oddly decked in a pair of ragged trowsers,\r\n     conspicuous for their ample dimensions in the seat. These\r\n     had evidently belonged to some grown-up person, but were cut\r\n     short in the legs to make them fit the wearer. A piece of\r\n     twine across the shoulder of this grotesque imp, served for\r\n     suspenders, and kept his habiliments from falling about his\r\n     feet. Ned ordered this crew to prepare for a foot-race, and\r\n     proposed a reward of a piece of money to the winner. They\r\n     were to run from a given point, about a hundred paces\r\n     distant, to the margin of the brook. Our whole suite of dogs\r\n     were in attendance, and seemed to understand our pastime. At\r\n     the word, away went the bevy, accompanied by every dog of\r\n     the pack, the negroes shouting and the dogs yelling in\r\n     unison. The shirts ran with prodigious speed, their speed\r\n     exposing their bare, black, and meager shanks to the scandal\r\n     of all beholders; and the strange baboon in trowsers\r\n     struggled close in their rear, with ludicrous earnestness,\r\n     holding up his redundant and troublesome apparel with his\r\n     hand. In a moment they reached the brook with unchecked\r\n     speed, and, as the banks were muddy, and the dogs had become\r\n     entangled with the racers in their path, two or three were\r\n     precipitated into the water. This only increased the\r\n     merriment, and they continued the contest in this new\r\n     element by floundering, kicking, and splashing about, like a\r\n     brood of ducks in their first descent upon a pool. These\r\n     young negroes have wonderfully flat noses, and the most\r\n     oddly disproportioned mouths, which were now opened to their\r\n     full dimensions, so as to display their white teeth in\r\n     striking contrast with their complexions. They are a strange\r\n     pack of antic and careless animals, and furnish the\r\n     liveliest picture that is to be found in nature of that race\r\n     of swart fairies, which, in the old time, were supposed to\r\n     play their pranks in the forest at moonlight. Ned stood by,\r\n     enjoying this scene like an amateur--encouraging the negroes\r\n     in their gambols, and hallooing to the dogs, that by a\r\n     kindred instinct entered tumultuously into the sport and\r\n     kept up the confusion. It was difficult to decide the\r\n     contest. So the money was thrown into the air, and as it\r\n     fell to ground, there was another rush, in which the hero of\r\n     the trowsers succeeded in getting the small coin from the\r\n     ground in his teeth, somewhat to the prejudice of his\r\n     finery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRILLING THE NEGRO BOYS.]\r\n\r\n     \"Rip asserts a special pre-eminence over these young serfs,\r\n     and has drilled them into a kind of local militia. He\r\n     sometimes has them all marshalled in the yard, and\r\n     entertains us with a review. They have an old watering-pot\r\n     for a drum, and a dingy pocket handkerchief for a standard,\r\n     under which they are arrayed in military order, and parade\r\n     over the grounds with a riotous clamor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREADING OUT WHEAT.]\r\n\r\nThe farmers of Virginia are scarcely as far advanced in the\r\napplication of science as the more active-minded Yankees, and among\r\nthe ancient customs which still obtain among them is that of treading\r\nout grain with cattle. At Swallow Barn the operation is described:\r\n\r\n     \"Within the farm-yard a party of negroes were engaged in\r\n     treading out grain. About a dozen horses were kept at full\r\n     trot around a circle of some ten or fifteen paces diameter,\r\n     which was strewed with wheat in the sheaf. These were\r\n     managed by some five or six little blacks, who rode like\r\n     monkey caricaturists of the games of the circus, and who\r\n     mingled with the labors of the place that comic air of\r\n     deviltry which communicated to the whole employment\r\n     something of the complexion of a pastime.\"\r\n\r\nWe hope this edition of _Swallow Barn_ will be so well received that\r\nthe author will give us all his other works in the same attractive\r\nstyle. _Horse-shoe Robinson_, _Rob of the Bowl_, _Quodlibet_, and all\r\nthe rest, except the _Life of Wirt_, are now out of print, and all\r\nhave been greeted on their first appearance with an approval that\r\nshould satisfy a more ambitious writer than Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE H. BOKER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Boker is one of the youngest of American authors. He is a native\r\nof Philadelphia, and was born, we believe, in the year 1824. After the\r\nusual preparatory studies in the city of his birth, he entered the\r\ncollege at Princeton, New Jersey, of which he is a graduate. In\r\naddition to the collegiate course, however, he devoted much time to\r\nthe study of Anglo-Saxon, and to the perusal of the early masters of\r\nEnglish literature, whose influence is discernible in all his earlier\r\npoems. Soon after leaving college he made a visit to France and\r\nEngland, but was obliged to return after having been but a short time\r\nabroad, owing to the critical state of his health. He was at that time\r\nsuffering under a pulmonary disease which threatened to be fatal, but\r\nall symptoms of which, fortunately, have since disappeared. On his\r\nreturn he took up his residence in Philadelphia, which continues to be\r\nhis home. Three or four years since he was married to an accomplished\r\nlady of that city.\r\n\r\nMr. Boker first appeared as an author at the commencement of the year\r\n1848, when a volume of his poems, under the title of _The Lesson of\r\nLife_, was published in Philadelphia. The publication of a volume was\r\nno light ordeal to a young poet whose name was unknown, and who, we\r\nbelieve, had never before seen himself in print. The lack of\r\nself-observation and self-criticism, which can only be acquired when\r\nthe author's thoughts have taken the matter-of-fact garb of type,\r\nwould of itself be sufficient to obscure much real promise. In spite\r\nof these disadvantages, the book contained much that gave the reader\r\nthe impression of a mind of genuine and original power. We remember\r\nbeing puzzled at its seeming incongruity, the bold, mature, and\r\nmasculine character of its thought being so strikingly at variance\r\nwith its frequent crudities of expression. It seemed to us the work of\r\na man in the prime of life, whose poetic feeling had taken a sudden\r\ngrowth, and moved somewhat unskilfully in the unaccustomed trammels of\r\nwords, rather than the first essay of a brain glowing with the fresh\r\ninspiration of youth.\r\n\r\nNo one saw the author's imperfections sooner than himself; and before\r\nthe year had closed, his tragedy of _Calaynos_ was published--a work\r\nso far in advance of what he had hitherto accomplished, so full, not\r\nonly of promise for the future, but of actual performance, that it\r\ntook his most confident friends by surprise. To write a five act\r\ntragedy is also a bold undertaking; but there is an old French proverb\r\nwhich, says, \"if you would shoot lions, don't begin by aiming at\r\nhares,\" and we believe there are fewer failures from attempting too\r\nmuch than from being content with too little. The success of\r\n_Calaynos_ showed that the author had not aimed beyond his reach. The\r\nbook attracted considerable attention, and its merits as a vigorous\r\nand original play, were very generally recognized. Although written\r\nwith no view to its representation on the stage, it did not escape the\r\nnotice of actors and managers, and a copy happening to fall into the\r\nhands of Mr. Phelps, a distinguished English tragedian, it was first\r\nperformed under his direction at the Theatre Royal, Saddler's Wells,\r\nMr. Phelps himself taking the part of Calaynos. Its success as an\r\nacting play was most decided, and after keeping the stage at Saddler's\r\nWells twenty or thirty nights, it went the round of the provinces. It\r\nhas already been performed more than a hundred times in different\r\nparts of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n_Calaynos_ gives evidence of true dramatic genius. The characters are\r\ndistinct and clearly drawn, and their individualities carefully\r\npreserved through all the movements of the plot, which is natural and\r\nnaturally developed. The passion on which the action hinges, is the\r\nprejudice of blood between the Spanish and Moorish families of Spain.\r\nThe interest of the plot, while it never loses sight of the hero, is\r\nshared in the first three acts by the other personages of the story,\r\nbut concentrates at the close on Calaynos, whose outbursts of love and\r\ngrief and revenge are drawn with striking power and eloquence. The\r\nplay is enlivened with many humorous passages, wherein the author\r\nshows his mastery of this element, so necessary to the complete\r\ndramatist.\r\n\r\nMr. Boker's next publication was the tragedy of _Anne Boleyn_, which\r\nappeared in February, 1850. In this work he touched on more familiar\r\nground, and in some instances, in his treatment of historical\r\ncharacters, came in conflict with the opinions or prejudices of the\r\ncritics. The necessity of adhering to history in the arrangement of\r\nthe plot and selection of the dramatis personae, imposed some restraint\r\non the author's mind, and hence, while _Anne Boleyn_ exhibits a calmer\r\nand more secure strength, and a riper artistic knowledge than\r\n_Calaynos_, it lacks the fire and passionate fervor of some passages\r\nof the latter. We should not forget, however, that the Thames has a\r\ncolder and sadder sun than the Guadalquiver. Objections have been made\r\nto Mr. Boker's King Henry, especially to his complaint of the torments\r\nof his conscience, and his moralizing over Norris's ingratitude. But\r\nthose who cavil at these points seem to forget that however vile and\r\nheartless King Henry appears to them, he is a very different man to\r\nhimself. The author's idea--and it is true to human nature--evidently\r\nis, that a criminal is not always guilty to his own mind. This marked\r\ninsensibility of King Henry to his own false and corrupt nature is a\r\nsubtle stroke of art.\r\n\r\nThe language of the tragedy is strong, terse, and full of point,\r\napproaching the sturdy Saxon idiom of the early English dramatists. We\r\nmight quote many passages in support of our opinion, as, for instance,\r\nthe scene between the Queen and her brother, Lord Rochford; between\r\nthe Queen and King Henry; Wyatt and Rochford, and King Henry and Jane\r\nSeymour. Two or three brief extracts we cannot avoid giving. Wyatt and\r\nRochford are in \"The Safety,\" the thieves' quarter of London--the St.\r\nGiles of that day. Wyatt speaks:\r\n\r\n    \"I oft have thought the watchful eye of God\r\n    Upon this place ne'er rested; or that hell\r\n    Had raised so black a smoke of densest sin\r\n    That the All-Beautiful, appalled, shrunk back\r\n    From its fierce ugliness. I tell you, friend,\r\n    When the great treason, which shall surely come\r\n    To burst in shards law-bound society,\r\n    Gives the first shudder, ere it grinds to dust\r\n    Thrones, ranks, and fortunes, and most cunning law--\r\n    When the great temple of our social state\r\n    Staggers and throbs, and totters back to chaos--\r\n    Let men look here, here in this fiery mass\r\n    Of aged crime and primal ignorance,\r\n    For the hot heart of all the mystery!--\r\n    Here, on this howling sea, let fall the scourge,\r\n    Or pour the oil of mercy!\r\n\r\n    _Rochford._                    Pour the oil--\r\n    In God's name, pour the blessed oil! The scourge,\r\n    Bloody and fierce, has fallen for ages past\r\n    Upon the foreward crests within its reach;\r\n    Yet made no more impression on the mass\r\n    Than Persia's whips upon the Hellespont!\"\r\n\r\nWyatt's soliloquy on beholding Queen Anne led forth to execution is\r\nfull of a rare and subtle beauty, both of thought and expression:\r\n\r\n                       \"O Anne, Anne!\r\n    The world may banish all regard for thee,\r\n    Mewing thy fame in frigid chronicles,\r\n    But every memory that haunts my mind\r\n    Shall cluster round thee still. _I'll hide thy name\r\n    Under the coverture of even lines,\r\n    I'll hint it darkly in familiar songs_,\r\n    I'll mix each melancholy thought of thee\r\n    Through all my numbers: _so that heedless men\r\n    Shall hold my love for thee within their hearts,\r\n    Not knowing of the treasure_.\"\r\n\r\nThe last scene, preceding the death of Anne Boleyn, is simple and\r\nalmost homely in its entire want of poetic imagery; yet nothing could\r\nbe more profoundly touching, and--in the highest sense of the\r\nword--tragic. The same tears which blur for us the lines of Browning's\r\n_Blot on the 'Scutcheon_, and the last words of Shelley's _Beatrice\r\nCenci_, suffuse our eyes at this parting address of Anne Boleyn to her\r\nmaidens, beside her on the scaffold:\r\n\r\n                  \"And ye, my damsels,\r\n    Who whilst I lived did ever show yourselves\r\n    So diligent in service, and are now\r\n    To be here present in my latest hour\r\n    Of mortal agony--as in good times\r\n    Ye were most trustworthy, even so in this,\r\n    My miserable death, ye leave me not.\r\n    As a poor recompense for your rich love,\r\n    I pray you to take comfort for my loss--\r\n    And yet forget me not. To the king's grace,\r\n    And to the happier one whom you may serve\r\n    In place of me, be faithful as to me.\r\n    Learn from this scene, the triumph of my fate,\r\n    To hold your honors far above your lives.\r\n    When you are praying to the martyred Christ,\r\n    Remember me who, as my weakness could,\r\n    Faltered afar behind His shining steps,\r\n    And died for truth, forgiving all mankind.\r\n    The Lord have pity on my helpless soul!\"\r\n\r\nSince the publication of _Anne Boleyn_, Mr. Boker has written two\r\nplays, _The Betrothal_, and _All the World a Mask_, both of which have\r\nbeen produced on the stage in Philadelphia with the most entire\r\nsuccess. _Calaynos_ was also played for a number of nights, Mr.\r\nMurdoch taking the principal part. _The Betrothal_ was performed in\r\nNew-York and Baltimore, with equal success. It is admirably adapted\r\nfor an acting play. The plot is not tragic, though the closing scenes\r\nhave a tragic air. The dialogue is more varied than in _Anne Boleyn_\r\nor _Calaynos_--now sparkling and full of point, now pithy, shrewd, and\r\npregnant with worldly wisdom, and now tender, graceful, and poetic.\r\n_All the World a Mask_ is a comedy of modern life. We have not seen it\r\nrepresented, and it has not yet been published; yet no one familiar\r\nwith the fine healthy humor displayed in portions of _Calaynos_ and\r\n_The Betrothal_ can doubt the author's ability to sustain himself\r\nthrough a five-act comedy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these plays, Mr. Boker has published from time to time,\r\nin the literary magazines, lyrics and ballads that would of themselves\r\nentitle him to rank among our most worthy poets. It is rare that a\r\ndramatic author possesses lyric genius, and _vice versa_, yet the true\r\nlyric inspiration is no less perceptible in Mr. Boker's _Song of the\r\nEarth_ and _Vision of the Goblet_, than the true dramatic faculty in\r\nhis _Anne Boleyn_.\r\n\r\nThere is a fresh, manly strength in his poetry, which may sometimes\r\njar the melody a little, but never allows his verse to flag. The life\r\nwhich informs it was inhaled in the open air; it is sincere and\r\nearnest, and touched with that fine enthusiasm which is the\r\nheart's-blood of lyric poetry. Take, for instance, this glorious\r\nBacchic, from the _Vision of the Goblet_:\r\n\r\n    \"Joy! joy! with Bacchus and his satyr train,\r\n      In triumph throbs our merry Grecian earth;\r\n    Joy! joy! the golden time has come again,\r\n      A god shall bless the vine's illustrious birth!\r\n                               Io, io, Bacche!\r\n\r\n    \"O breezes, speed across the mellow lands,\r\n      And breathe his coming to the joyous vine;\r\n    Let all the vineyards wave their leafy hands\r\n      Upon the hills to greet this pomp divine!\r\n                               Io, io, Bacche!\r\n\r\n    \"O peaceful triumph, victory without tear,\r\n      Or human cry, or drop of conquered blood!\r\n    Save dew-beads bright, that on the vine appear,\r\n      The choral shouts, the trampled grape's red flood!\r\n                               Io, io, Bacche!\r\n\r\n    \"Shout, Hellas, shout! the lord of joy is come,\r\n      Bearing the mortal Lethe in his hands,\r\n    To wake the wailing lips of Sorrow dumb,\r\n      To bind sad Memory's eyes with rosy bands:\r\n                               Io, io, Bacche!\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Song of the Earth_, which shows a higher exercise of the\r\npoetic faculty than any thing else Mr. Boker has written, he has\r\nenriched the language with a new form of versification. Except in this\r\npoem, we do not remember ever to have seen _dactylic_ blank verse\r\nattempted in the English language. The majestic and resonant harmonies\r\nof the measure are strikingly adapted to the poet's theme. The\r\nconcluding _Chorus of Stars_, rebuking the Earth for her pride as the\r\ndwelling-place of the human soul, is a splendid effort of the\r\nimagination. We know not where to find surpassed the sounding sweep of\r\nthe rhythm in the final lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Heir of eternity, Mother of Souls,\r\n    Let not thy knowledge betray thee to folly!\r\n    Knowledge is proud, self-sufficient, and lone,\r\n    Trusting, unguided, its steps in the darkness.\r\n    Thine is the wisdom that mankind may win,\r\n    Gleaned in the pathway between joy and sorrow;\r\n    Ours is the wisdom that hallows the child\r\n    Fresh from the touch of his awful Creator,\r\n    Dropped like a star on thy shadowy realm,\r\n    Falling in splendor, but falling to darken.\r\n    Ours is the simple religion of Faith,\r\n    Trusting alone in the God who o'errules us;\r\n    Thine are the complex misgivings of Doubt,\r\n    Wrested to form by imperious Reason.\r\n    _Knowledge is restless, imperfect, and sad;\r\n    Faith is serene, and completed, and joyful._\r\n    Bow in humility, bow thy proud forehead,\r\n    Circle thy form with a mantle of clouds,\r\n    _Hide from the glittering cohorts of evening,\r\n    Wheeling in purity, singing in chorus:\r\n    Howl in the depths of thy lone, barren mountains,\r\n    Restlessly moan on the deserts of ocean,\r\n    Wail o'er thy fall in the desolate forests,\r\n    Lost star of Paradise, straying alone!_\"\r\n\r\nIn the flush of youth, fortunate in all the relations of life, and\r\nwith a fame already secured, there is perhaps no American author to\r\nwhom the future promises more than to Mr. Boker. He has that faithful\r\nreverence for his art which makes harmless the breath of praise, more\r\ndangerous to the poet than that of censure, and there are yet many\r\nyears before him ere his mind attains its full scope and stature. That\r\nall these promises may be fulfilled, to his own honor and that of\r\nAmerican literature, is the earnest hope of\r\n\r\n                                      BAYARD TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERR FLEISCHMANN\r\n\r\nON THE INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE AMERICANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the careful watch we keep of French, German, and other foreign\r\nliteratures, for what will instruct or entertain the readers of the\r\n_International_, we are always sharp-sighted for any thing said of us\r\nor our institutions, whether it be in sympathy or in antipathy. So,\r\nfor a recent number, we translated from the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ a\r\nvery clever paper on our American Female Poets, and on other occasions\r\nhave reviewed or done into English a great many compositions which\r\nevinced the feeling of continental Europe in regard to our character\r\nand movements. We shall continue in this habit, as there is scarcely\r\nany thing ever more amusing than \"what the world says\" of our\r\nconcerns, even when it is in the least amiable temper.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting works published of late months in Germany,\r\nis FLEISCHMANN'S _Erwerbszweige der Vereinigten Staaten\r\nNord-America's_, (or Branches of Industry in the United States.) The\r\nreader who anticipates from this title a mere mass of statistics\r\nrelative to the industrial condition of our own country will find\r\nhimself agreeably disappointed. Statistics are indeed there--lists of\r\nfigures and relative annual arrays of products, sufficient to satisfy\r\nany one that Mr. Fleischmann has turned the several years during which\r\nhe was connected with the Patent Office at Washington to good account.\r\nBut in addition to this there is a mass of information and\r\nobservation, which, though nearly connected with the subject, was yet\r\nhardly to be expected. It is doubtful whether the social and domestic\r\npeculiarities of others or of ourselves be most attractive, but to\r\nthose who prefer the latter, and who have lived as many do under the\r\nimpression that our own habits and ways of life present little that is\r\nmarked or distinctive, this work will be found not only interesting,\r\nbut even amusing. For among those practising branches of industry, he\r\nnot only includes blacksmiths, coopers, architects, planters, and\r\npin-makers, but also clergymen, actors, circus-riders, model-artists,\r\nmidwives, and boarding-house keepers! The main object of the work\r\nbeing to inform his countrymen who propose emigration, of the true\r\nstate of the most available branches of industry in this country, and\r\nprevent on their part undue anticipation or disappointment, even these\r\nitems cannot be deemed out of place. Cherishing an enthusiastic\r\nadmiration of our country, and better informed in all probability in\r\nthe branches of which he treats than any foreigner who has before\r\nventured upon the subject, it is not astonishing that he should have\r\nproduced a work which not only fully answers the object intended, but\r\nin a faithful translation would doubtless be extensively read by our\r\nown countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find in this book many _little_ traits of our domestic\r\nlife, which, commonplace though they be, are not unattractive when\r\nthus reflected back on us, mirror-like, from another land. Take for\r\nexample the following account of confectioners:\r\n\r\n     \"All men are more or less fond of sweet food and dainties,\r\n     and the wealthier a people may be, and consequently in more\r\n     fit condition to add such luxuries to the necessaries of\r\n     life, the greater will be its consumption of sugar. If we\r\n     compare the sugar consumption of England with that of\r\n     Germany, we find the first consumes a far greater quantity\r\n     per head than the latter.\r\n\r\n     \"And in this respect the Americans are in no wise behind the\r\n     English, since they not only at least twice a day drink\r\n     either tea or coffee, which they abundantly sweeten,\r\n     enjoying therewith vast quantities of preserved fruits, and\r\n     every variety of cakes, but they have universally a\r\n     remarkable appetite for sweets, which from childhood up is\r\n     nourished with all sorts of confectionery. And this appetite\r\n     is very generally retained even to an advanced age, so that\r\n     all the _cents_ of the children, and many of the dollars of\r\n     those more advanced in life, go to the _candy-shops_ and\r\n     _confectioneries_. Add to this the numerous balls,\r\n     marriages, and other festive occasions, particularly the\r\n     parties in private houses, at which pyramids, temples, and\r\n     other architectural and artistic works, founded on rocks of\r\n     candied sugar, and bonsbons, are never wanting, we can\r\n     readily imagine that in this country the confectioner's\r\n     trade is a flourishing and brilliant business.\r\n\r\n     \"The Americans are, as is well known, universally a\r\n     remarkably hospitable people, not only frequently\r\n     entertaining guests in their homes, but also holding it as\r\n     an established point of _bon ton_, to give one or two\r\n     parties annually, to which _all_ their friends are invited.\r\n     The evening is then spent with music and dancing, concluded\r\n     with an extremely elegant (_hochst elegant_) supper, at\r\n     which the gentlemen wisely stick to the more substantial\r\n     viands and champagne, but where abundance of sugar-work for\r\n     the ladies is never wanting.\r\n\r\n     \"And since no family will be surpassed by another, the most\r\n     incredible extravagance not infrequently results from this\r\n     unfortunate spirit of rivalry. Confectionery is often\r\n     brought for a certain party expressly from France, fresh\r\n     fruits from the West Indies, and the stairways and rooms are\r\n     adorned with the most exquisite flowers which Europe can\r\n     yield, while the guests are served on costly porcelain and\r\n     massive plate. In a word, the greatest imaginable expense is\r\n     lavished on these festive occasions, which prevail in every\r\n     class of society, and in none--be their degree what it\r\n     may--are sugared sweets wanting: the poorer confining\r\n     themselves, it is true, to such dainties as are the\r\n     production of the country, excepting indeed a few bottles of\r\n     champagne, which latter is absolutely indispensable.\r\n\r\n     \"I have deemed it necessary to touch upon these\r\n     extravagances of American life, that I might show that while\r\n     on the one hand an expert confectioner may readily find\r\n     employment during the season, on the other that mere skill\r\n     and industry are by no means sufficient of themselves to\r\n     support an establishment grounded on credit.\r\n\r\n     \"Nearly all the small shopkeepers, fruit-dealers, and\r\n     bar-keepers, sell candy and sugar-cakes, which they either\r\n     prepare themselves or obtain from confectioners who not only\r\n     carry on a wholesale business, _but even send large\r\n     quantities of their products to the country dealers_. In\r\n     Philadelphia, warm cakes are carried about for sale in the\r\n     streets,[1] the bearers thereof announcing their presence by\r\n     the sound of a bell. French confectioners have already done\r\n     much in this country toward improving the public taste, and\r\n     excellent _bonsbons a la francaise_ are now actually\r\n     manufactured here, though we must admit that in the country\r\n     there is a great consumption of confectionery and cakes by\r\n     no means of a very good quality. In these regions a taste\r\n     for '_horses_' (which are of cake greatly resembling\r\n     gingerbread and made in the form of a horse) universally\r\n     predominates, and not only children but even adults select\r\n     these as a favorite dainty. It is no unusual spectacle to\r\n     behold in the northern states an entire court--judge, jury,\r\n     and lawyers--regaling themselves during an important trial\r\n     on horse-cakes!\"\r\n\r\nWhether Herr Fleischmann received this legal anecdote on hearsay, or\r\nwhether his German soul was actually startled by stumbling upon such\r\nan extraordinary legal spectacle, we will not here inquire. In Germany\r\nthe favorite dainty in this line is a _pretzel_, or carnival cake, in\r\nthe form of a two-headed serpent, which antiquaries declare to be of\r\noriental origin, and to conceal divers horrific mysteries of deeply\r\nmetaphysical import. From the solemnity of tone with which Herr\r\nFleischmann imparts this horse-cake story, we are half inclined to\r\nsuspect that he inferred that a great ethical mystery, in some way\r\nconnected with the administration of justice in America, might thus be\r\nconveyed.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of spirit distilleries our author enters into a _naif_\r\nand enthusiastic defence of good brandy, but still highly approves of\r\nthe American custom of substituting coffee for grog in merchant\r\nvessels, on which he remarks that it is not allowed to soldiers or\r\nsailors to bring spirits into the forts or ships. \"But they are so\r\nextravagantly fond of liquor as to invent every imaginable method of\r\nevading the regulation. I have been told,\" he says, \"by persons of the\r\nhighest credibility that during the night whisky is not unfrequently\r\nbrought to the vicinity of military stations, and that the sentinels,\r\nafter filling the barrels of their muskets therewith, bring it into\r\nthe 'watch-room,' and divide the _loading_ with their comrades.\"\r\n\r\nAfter remarking the melancholy fact, which the strictest examination\r\nwould, we fear confirm, in a still higher degree, that the\r\nsewing-girls employed in our umbrella factories, tailor\r\nestablishments, &c., are very inadequately paid, he makes a statement\r\nwhich is, however, glaringly false, that among these poor girls\r\ncorruption of manners prevails to a degree unknown in any country of\r\nEurope, save indeed \"merry England.\" Without being familiar with such\r\nstatistics, we are on the contrary firmly convinced that though\r\nfemales in these employments are _not_ so well paid even as in\r\nGermany, there is no country on the face of the earth--most certainly\r\nnot in Bavaria, Austria, or Prussia, where the standard of morals is\r\nin this respect so high as in our own. There are a thousand\r\ncorrelative facts in the state of society in our country which confirm\r\nour assertion. This opinion of our author's is, however, slightly at\r\nvariance, as far as appearance is concerned, with a part of the\r\nfollowing good advice to the more beautiful portion of his fair young\r\ncountrywomen, who propose repairing to this country for the sake of\r\ncatching husbands:\r\n\r\n     \"And I deem this a fit place to give them a warning, which I\r\n     have before often repeated, namely, that these lovely\r\n     beings, when they forsake their homes, also leave behind\r\n     them their fantastic national dress. In this country long\r\n     dresses are worn--and not merely frocks which barely reach\r\n     the knee, as is usual in several parts of Germany. The same\r\n     may be applied to their head-dresses, which are not\r\n     unfrequently so eccentric as to give their wearers the\r\n     appearance of having escaped from a lunatic asylum. On which\r\n     account, I beg my _ladies_, or any women who design\r\n     emigrating to this land of equality, to buy themselves\r\n     French bonnets,[2] or a similar style of head covering, but\r\n     in no instance to run bareheaded about the streets, which is\r\n     here remarkably unpopular, since neither widow, wife, nor\r\n     maiden, ever appears in the public way without hat or\r\n     bonnet. And I moreover beg of them, on their first arrival\r\n     in the populous cities, to restrain their manifestations of\r\n     affection to the house, where walls are the only witnesses,\r\n     _and not to permit their lovers, fiancees, or husbands, to\r\n     clasp them about the waist, and lead them in this close\r\n     embrace about the streets_, since this would be for\r\n     Americans a scandalous spectacle. I will not assert that the\r\n     American is incapable of tender feeling, but he at least\r\n     observes decency in the public streets, and _apropos_ of\r\n     this, I would further remark, that in this country the wife\r\n     or maiden invariably walks by the side of her male\r\n     companion, and never follows after him in _Indian\r\n     file_--that is, like geese returning from pasture.\"\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on hat-makers, we are informed that neither French,\r\nGermans, nor English, can in this country compete with the Americans\r\nin the manufacture of hats; and that he was informed by a very\r\nintelligent manufacturer that the work of Germans by no means suited\r\nour market, and further, that within a few years past the use of caps\r\nhas increased at least two thirds, though these are by no means so\r\nwell adapted to carry papers, &c., as hats, in which Americans are\r\naccustomed to convey their archives.\r\n\r\nOf boarding-houses:\r\n\r\n     \"These extremely convenient establishments, in which\r\n     lodging, food, and all things requisite, are provided, may\r\n     be found in all the cities in the United States; but we\r\n     first learn to duly appreciate their value, when, on\r\n     returning to Germany, we find ourselves obliged either to\r\n     lodge in a hotel, or for a short stay in a place hire and\r\n     perhaps furnish rooms for ourselves.\r\n\r\n     \"These communistic institutions, where one person or family\r\n     takes care of several, give the _boarder_ all the\r\n     conveniences of a hotel, united to the advantages of\r\n     dwelling in a private family. He has opportunities of\r\n     entering such society as is adapted to his habits and\r\n     tastes, in addition to which he has what may be termed a\r\n     _chez soi_--he feels that he is 'in house.'[3]\r\n\r\n     \"Such boarding-houses are generally kept by widows or old\r\n     maids, and even ladies of the highest families take refuge\r\n     in this branch of industry, to maintain respectably\r\n     themselves and families.\r\n\r\n     \"Fashionable houses of this sort are splendidly furnished,\r\n     and supplied with excellent dishes and attendance. In these\r\n     the price is naturally high, since for a room, without fuel,\r\n     from six to twelve dollars a week is generally paid. Rooms\r\n     in the upper part of the house are of course cheaper. The\r\n     parlor is common to all the persons in the house--they meet\r\n     there, before and after meals, pass the evening with\r\n     reading, music, &c., receive visits, and live in all\r\n     respects as if at home.\r\n\r\n     \"The Americans are of a very accommodating\r\n     disposition--particularly the men, who, from a regard for\r\n     the lady of the house, are easily contented. The ladies, on\r\n     the contrary, very frequently indulge in little feuds,\r\n     produced by the _ennui_ resulting from a want of domestic\r\n     employment, and living in common; but all are on the whole\r\n     very circumspect, are careful to live _in Christian love and\r\n     unity_ with one another, and never offend external\r\n     propriety.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not requisite in America to take a license from the\r\n     police to establish a boarding-house, unless a bar-room be\r\n     therewith connected. The person undertaking such an\r\n     enterprise rents a house, makes it known in newspapers or\r\n     among friends, or simply placards on the door\r\n     'Boarding'--and the establishment is opened without further\r\n     ceremony. Particular introductions and recommendations are\r\n     requisite to be received in a boarding-house of higher\r\n     rank.\"\r\n\r\nThere is even yet a lingering prejudice prevailing in this country in\r\nfavor of certain musical instruments of European manufacture, which\r\nthis work is well adapted to dissipate, since the author appears to be\r\nin this particular an excellent judge. Take for example his chapter on\r\npianos:\r\n\r\n     \"The favorite musical instrument of the American ladies is\r\n     the piano, and in every family with the slightest\r\n     pretensions to education or refinement a piano may certainly\r\n     be found, upon which, of an evening, the young 'Miss' plays\r\n     to her parents the pieces which she has learned, or\r\n     accompanies them with her voice. If the stranger will walk\r\n     of an evening through the streets of an American city, he\r\n     can hear in almost every house a piano and the song of\r\n     youthful voices, often very agreeable, though the latter are\r\n     not unfrequently wanting in proper culture. Many of these\r\n     amateurs have beyond doubt remarkable talent, and would in\r\n     their art attain to a high degree of perfection if they had\r\n     better opportunities to hear the best music, to study more\r\n     industriously, and practice more than they do, but their\r\n     domestic audiences are unfortunately easily pleased, in\r\n     consequence of which their knowledge seldom extends beyond\r\n     well known opera pieces and favorite popular airs.\r\n\r\n     \"A few years since, pianos were generally imported from\r\n     Germany, England, and France, but it was soon found that\r\n     their construction and material were by no means adapted to\r\n     withstand the changes of the American climate; and it was\r\n     also found that the enormous profit cleared by the\r\n     importers, might quite as well be retained in this country,\r\n     and there are consequently, at present, in Boston, New-York,\r\n     Philadelphia, and even Baltimore, excellent and extensive\r\n     'piano forte manufactories,' in which every portion of these\r\n     instruments is constructed. For this purpose the best\r\n     varieties of wood known are used, such as mahogany and\r\n     rosewood, which, however, in America are obtainable at cheap\r\n     rates. The cases are of the most solid construction\r\n     possible, and the legs massive, (by which especially the\r\n     firmest duration is insured) all constructed of the\r\n     above-mentioned material, which is quickly and accurately\r\n     cut into the requisite form by a machine.... By means of\r\n     these and other improvements, but particularly by means of\r\n     the material, are the American pianos not only far more\r\n     durable than the imported, but also infinitely less subject\r\n     to loss of tone.\r\n\r\n     \"The American pianos are invariably of a table form, in\r\n     order to adapt them to small rooms. Their tone is sweet and\r\n     rich, and has been pronounced clear, full and pleasing, by\r\n     the best European performers. The pianos of Stottart\r\n     (Stoddard) and Nunns, in New-York, of Laud and Mayer, in\r\n     Philadelphia, and especially of Chickering, in Boston, enjoy\r\n     a high reputation. This latter enterprising individual\r\n     spares no expense to secure the best improvements, and apply\r\n     them to his instruments. Other excellent manufactories also\r\n     abound, among which are many German proprietors, who,\r\n     however, all follow the American style of construction.\r\n\r\n     \"Previous to the year 1847, about sixty-four patents for\r\n     improvements in pianos were taken out.... The average price\r\n     of a splendid 'Chickering,' of 7-1/2 octaves, is from $350\r\n     to $400. I have purchased of Stoddard in New-York an\r\n     excellent and handsome instrument for $250; since which time\r\n     (A. D. 1848) the price for the same has sunk fifty dollars.\r\n     Instruments of a lighter construction may be bought for one\r\n     hundred and fifty dollars; nor will it be long ere the best\r\n     pianos may be had for a price ranging from $180 to $200.\r\n     There are in America men whose exclusive business it is to\r\n     tune pianos, for which they generally receive one dollar....\r\n\r\n     \"While on the subject of music, I may be permitted to speak\r\n     of an outcast class of minstrels, namely, the harp girls;\r\n     who, after having wandered through Germany, or even England,\r\n     or having been turned out of the same, find their way to the\r\n     United States. Especially in New Orleans are they at home,\r\n     and there sing, in the coffee-houses and bar-rooms, most\r\n     blackguard (_zotenhaften lieder_) songs, in the English\r\n     language, learned either _at home or in England_--partly to\r\n     the delight and partly to the disgust of the mixed companies\r\n     there assembled. Germany can in truth take but little pride\r\n     in such representatives of her nationality. She is already\r\n     too little appreciated in America to render it necessary\r\n     that such females should still further degrade her--females,\r\n     for whom the American (who invariably holds in high respect\r\n     the sex) entertains an unconquerable disgust. Apropos of\r\n     those, I may mention the so-called 'broom girls,' who sell a\r\n     sort of little brooms or fly-brushes, singing therewith\r\n     fearful songs; and finally, the innumerable organ and\r\n     tambourine players, who frequently have with them a child\r\n     which dances like an ape to the sound of their horrible\r\n     music.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the practical and common-sense-like manner in which the subject\r\nis treated, the following chapter on boarding-schools will probably\r\nprove interesting to every American reader:\r\n\r\n     \"Would not any one imagine that a nation like the German,\r\n     which is universally recognized as the best educated and\r\n     most erudite, which has written and effected so much for the\r\n     cause of education, would naturally be the one to supply the\r\n     world with accomplished teachers? Is there in the civilized\r\n     world another nation where so many men have made it the\r\n     entire business of a life, passed in the most zealous and\r\n     deeply grounded studies of all languages, living and dead,\r\n     or who have so fully succeeded in teaching even foreigners\r\n     their own language? Certainly not. 'Whence comes it then,'\r\n     any one may reasonably inquire, 'that these learned men, who\r\n     appear to be, in every respect, so peculiarly adapted to\r\n     teach, have not long since conducted the education of the\r\n     whole world? Or why is it, that in North America at least,\r\n     where a widely spread German element throws open so vast a\r\n     field to their exertions, they have not the direction of\r\n     every private school?'\r\n\r\n     \"Incomprehensible as this may appear at a first glance, it\r\n     is still explicable in a few words. The American seeks, for\r\n     the education of his children, _practical men, who are not\r\n     only adapted to and skilled in their vocation, but also\r\n     familiar with the world--its progress and requirements_--men\r\n     not only capable of teaching their pupils the rules of\r\n     grammar and syntax, but who are also qualified to impart the\r\n     peculiarities and precepts of life in the world at\r\n     large--men of prepossessing manner and appearance, and whose\r\n     habits are adapted to the requirements of refined society.\r\n     This it is, in a few words, that the American requires. And\r\n     now, I ask--how many old and young teachers are there in\r\n     Germany thus qualified?\r\n\r\n     \"I here speak, of course, in a general way; for I well know\r\n     that there are in Germany many teachers and learned men, who\r\n     could more than fulfil all of these requirements of the\r\n     American parent, but their number is unfortunately limited;\r\n     and I deem it important that I speak freely and fully on\r\n     this subject, since many a learned German, whose\r\n     acquirements and scientific knowledge would insure him an\r\n     independent and respectable station at home, nevertheless\r\n     frequently finds himself compelled by the pressure of\r\n     circumstances to seek America, in the hope of there opening\r\n     a school, or at least finding employment as teacher, and\r\n     there too frequently, in addition to the bitterest\r\n     disappointment, discovers too late that he is fit for no\r\n     other practical employment which will yield him his daily\r\n     bread.\r\n\r\n     \"As a proof, however, that most of these so called\r\n     pedagogues must in America be necessarily deceived in their\r\n     expectations, I take the liberty of adding yet a few words.\r\n\r\n     \"The American requires before all, as far as the moral\r\n     qualifications of the teacher are concerned, a firm\r\n     religious tendency--a requirement for which the scion of\r\n     'Young Germany,' fresh from his university career, has but\r\n     little taste; since his recollections of that life are yet\r\n     too fresh upon him to admit of a willing submission to such\r\n     rules,--and I advise any one who proposes to follow such a\r\n     course to become a farmer's man, rather than a hypocrite or\r\n     sham-saint....\r\n\r\n     \"If we proceed in our examination of private schools in\r\n     America, we find that the majority are for the education of\r\n     girls. Upon which the question arises--Are German ladies\r\n     generally adapted to the superintendence of such\r\n     establishments?--a question which I must either answer with\r\n     No, or modify with the admission that if there be any\r\n     schools managed by German ladies, I am ignorant of their\r\n     existence. The cause for the negative being essentially the\r\n     same as with the male scholars.\r\n\r\n     \"No man can better appreciate the worth of German women than\r\n     myself. I acknowledge perfectly their virtues and\r\n     excellencies--their domestic sphere is their world,\r\n     inhabited by their children and ruled by their husbands,\r\n     whose faithful, true-hearted, modest, obedient companions\r\n     they are. To be independent and free is not in their nature;\r\n     they are not so adapted either by origin or manner of life;\r\n     nor does their education embrace any thing cosmopolitan.\r\n     Born and brought up in a province, or court city, they have\r\n     never cast a glance beyond its limits or boundaries, or\r\n     those of the nearest town, and all that lies beyond is to\r\n     them unknown and uninteresting. Thus they generally lead,\r\n     according to ancient custom, (_nach altem brauch_) an\r\n     almost vegetable life; and nothing save the dictates of\r\n     fashion can ever disturb in the slightest degree the\r\n     equanimity of their quiet souls. They do not in the least\r\n     interest themselves in the progress of industry, literature,\r\n     science, or politics, even in Germany--much less for that of\r\n     foreign countries; but are content with learning in which\r\n     section of the place they inhabit this or that necessary\r\n     article may be best or most cheaply purchased; what late\r\n     foreign romance is current in the circulating library; and\r\n     what are the latest changes in bonnets, caps, chemisettes,\r\n     or dresses, in the kingdom of fashion--whose sovereign they\r\n     all obey. In politics they rest under the perpetual\r\n     conviction that all goes on in the old way, and pass their\r\n     leisure hours in coteries and parties, where knittings\r\n     exclude all _spirituelle_ entertainment. In the lower grades\r\n     of the middle class, they grow up with an unchangeable\r\n     feeling of social inferiority, and shudder at every free\r\n     glance into life, as if guilty of unheard of arrogance and\r\n     presumption.\r\n\r\n     \"And how is it possible that a woman who has grown up in\r\n     such social relations should, despite the fullest possession\r\n     of all imaginable virtues and acquirements, be capable of\r\n     teaching high-minded and independent girls? The American\r\n     maiden regards most household employments as work requiring\r\n     but little intelligence, and for which even negroes are as\r\n     well qualified. She believes that she can better occupy the\r\n     time necessary to the acquisition of subordinate\r\n     acquirements, and prefers reading, music, and art, to\r\n     knitting stockings, and similar soul-killing business. She\r\n     recognizes, moreover, no distinction in rank, but strives to\r\n     acquire as many accomplishments and as refined manners as\r\n     any other person. In short, she strives to become _a lady_,\r\n     and regards it as no extraordinary assumption, particularly\r\n     when education or natural advantages adapt her thereto, to\r\n     consider herself quite as good as any other woman in the\r\n     republic. Nor does she forget that the time will come when,\r\n     as mother, the first development of her child's mind will\r\n     become a duty, and she remembers also that he will be a\r\n     republican whose sphere of action is without limit, if his\r\n     ability correspond only to the effort. Moreover, the\r\n     American maidens are materially very _wide awake_, (_sehr\r\n     auf gewecht_,) particularly in the large cities, where they\r\n     enjoy excellent opportunities for instruction, and are\r\n     proportionally highly educated.\r\n\r\n     \"The American woman or girl highly esteems the _elegant_ and\r\n     _noble_, striving ever to form herself after this pattern,\r\n     on which account French female teachers are universally\r\n     preferred, even when very imperfectly qualified. The\r\n     revolutions in France have driven forth many well educated\r\n     persons to America, who have been compelled to seek by\r\n     teaching a livelihood. Louis Philippe himself was once among\r\n     the number. In addition to the fact that no nation surpasses\r\n     the French in personal accomplishments, they have for\r\n     Americans the further recommendation that their nation has\r\n     played an important part in modern history. The American is\r\n     impressed in favor of France, because she aided him in\r\n     freeing his country from the yoke of England; and this\r\n     inclination manifests itself continually in language.\r\n\r\n     \"And when the American boy glances over his school-books, he\r\n     sees France represented in pictures as the _polite_ nation,\r\n     and reads in history that she aided his country in the war\r\n     of freedom, and that Lafayette was the _friend_ of\r\n     Washington; while the same work represents the German as a\r\n     merely agricultural race, portrayed in the caricature of an\r\n     Altenburger peasant and his wife, in their fantastic\r\n     national dress. From the same book he also learns that a\r\n     German prince sold his subjects for so many pounds per head\r\n     to aid England to subdue his country. Such contrasts cannot\r\n     but awake in the child's mind deeply-rooted prejudices, far\r\n     from favorable to the German race.\r\n\r\n     \"And since there has been for years an emigration to America\r\n     of Germans who were very generally poor and\r\n     uneducated--people speaking a revolting dialect, employed in\r\n     the lowest offices, and not unfrequently much resembling the\r\n     pictures in the geographies, the prejudice formed in early\r\n     youth has been thus strengthened, that the Germans are a\r\n     rough, uncultivated race, industrious and domestic, it is\r\n     true, but yet very little improved by civilization--of all\r\n     which the native Pennsylvania Germans afford unfortunately\r\n     striking examples. The well-educated American, of course,\r\n     knows better how to appreciate the true value of the\r\n     Germans; he is aware of the value of their contributions to\r\n     literature, science, art, and music; only in politics, and\r\n     in the practical application of knowledge, he places (and\r\n     not without justice) but little confidence in them.\r\n\r\n     \"But the personal appearance and bearing of many Germans,\r\n     who are in themselves truly worthy of respect, often induce\r\n     the well-educated and refined American to place in the back\r\n     ground their otherwise estimable qualities. There is often\r\n     something rough and harsh about the German, and his domestic\r\n     habits are not invariably in unison with his erudition and\r\n     excellent education, but frequently destroy the good\r\n     impression which the latter might produce; moreover, their\r\n     '_geselliges Leben_,' (social jovial life) as Germans term\r\n     it, with its accompaniments of pipe and mug, are in the\r\n     highest degree revolting to an American. And further, it is\r\n     taken ill of the German that he considers that regard for\r\n     the sex, entertained by the American, as carried somewhat\r\n     too far, and allows himself to form on this point a too\r\n     hasty, and not seldom unfavorable judgment, without seeking\r\n     to examine more accurately this domestic characteristic.\r\n     Many Germans find it impossible to enter into the spirit of\r\n     American life, customs, and manners, while on religious\r\n     subjects it appears impossible for either to adopt the same\r\n     views: so that there is apparently almost no point in common\r\n     between them.\"\r\n\r\nAfter stating that many educated Germans might succeed as teachers in\r\nthis country, could they dispense with national peculiarities, and a\r\ndescription of the manner of establishing schools, in which he pays a\r\nhigh compliment to the general appearance of such institutions in our\r\ncountry, he adds:\r\n\r\n     \"The superintendent of such an establishment must entirely\r\n     renounce all visits to bar-rooms and coffee-houses. He must\r\n     learn to impart to his system of instruction the elements of\r\n     novelty and attractiveness, and especially learn to make\r\n     friends of the children. It is utterly impossible in this\r\n     country to manage a school by the mere force of power and\r\n     authority, and the teacher attempting this, soon experiences\r\n     a revolution by which indeed he is not exactly _driven\r\n     forth_, but left _alone_ on his _cathedra_.\"\r\n\r\nWith this extract we close, regretting that we have been obliged to\r\nleave untranslated many more practical and not less interesting items.\r\nWe consider the entire work as the best possible answer which can be\r\ngiven to the question, '_Why has America done so little for England's\r\nfair?_' No one who contemplates in it the immense range of our\r\nmanufactories--our incredible combinations of excellence and\r\ncheapness, and the almost superhuman rapidity of our progress in every\r\nbranch of industrial and social life, will entertain for an instant\r\nthe slightest regret that we have not done more to increase the\r\nprofits of John Bull's raree-show.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Muffins?--_International._\r\n\r\n[2] _Pariser-tracht_--French dress--is the epithet usually applied in\r\nGermany to our ordinary style of costume, in contradistinction to the\r\n_Bauern-tracht_, or peasant's costume, which is so frequently seen among\r\nGerman immigrants.\r\n\r\n[3] _Zu hause_--at house, at home. In this sentence the reader finds a\r\nstriking exemplification of the saying, that neither in French nor German\r\nis there a word for _home_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE HAREM.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY R.

Leon Gozlan, one of the most esteemed magazinists in France, has\r\nlately paid a flying visit to the scene of his country's most glorious\r\ndisasters, Waterloo, and has given a characteristic account of what he\r\nsaw and heard there. We quote a part of it, in which he describes a\r\nknavish practice of which great numbers are every year made victims.\r\nM. Gozlan has just passed through the Brussels _faubourg_ Louisa, and\r\nis oppressed with most melancholy reflections, when his coachman\r\naddresses him--\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,\" exclaimed my conductor, suddenly interrupting my\r\n     meditations, \"excuse me if I am troublesome, but before\r\n     arriving at Mont-Saint-Jean I wish to warn you of a knavish\r\n     trade you have probably never heard of at Paris.\"\r\n\r\n     \"A knavish trade unknown at Paris?\" I replied,\r\n     incredulously; \"that is rather surprising. But come, tell me\r\n     what is this new species of industry.\"\r\n\r\n     \"You can easily suppose,\" pursued my loquacious coachman,\r\n     \"that after the battle of Waterloo there remained on the\r\n     field a large quantity of cannon-balls, buttons, small brass\r\n     eagles, and broken weapons. Well, for the last thirty-four\r\n     years, the country people have been carrying on a famous\r\n     business in these articles.\"\r\n\r\n     \"It seems to me, however, my friend,\" I observed, \"that a\r\n     sale continued for so long a period, must have left very\r\n     little to be disposed of at present.\"\r\n\r\n     \"True, sir; and this is precisely what I would guard you\r\n     against. Those who obtain a subsistence by such means,\r\n     purchase the goods new at a manufactory, in shares, and then\r\n     bury in different parts of the field, and for a wide space\r\n     around, pieces of imperial brass eagles, thousands of metal\r\n     buttons, and heaps of iron balls. This crop is allowed to\r\n     rest in the earth until summer, for few strangers visit\r\n     Waterloo in winter; and when the fine weather arrives, they\r\n     dig up their relics, to which a sojourn of eight months in a\r\n     damp soil gives an appearance of age, deceiving the keenest\r\n     observer, and awakening the admiration of pilgrims.\"\r\n\r\n     \"But this is a shameful deceit.\"\r\n\r\n     \"True again, sir; but the country is very poor about here;\r\n     and after all, perhaps,\" added the philosophic driver, \"no\r\n     great harm is done. This year the harvest of brass eagles\r\n     has been very fair.\"\r\n\r\n     We entered the forest of Soignies by a narrow and naturally\r\n     covered alley, the two sides crowned with the most luxuriant\r\n     foliage. Poplars, elms, and plane-trees appeared to be\r\n     striving which should attain the highest elevation. One\r\n     peculiarity I could not avoid remarking in the midst of this\r\n     solemn and beautiful abode of nature, and that was the\r\n     perfect stillness prevailing around. The air itself seemed\r\n     without palpitation, and during a ride of nearly two hours\r\n     through this sylvan gallery, not even the note of a bird\r\n     broke on the solitude. A forest without feathered songsters\r\n     appeared unnatural, and the only possible reason that could\r\n     be imagined for such a circumstance might be, that since the\r\n     formidable day of Waterloo, they had quitted these shades,\r\n     never to return, frightened away by the roar of the cannon\r\n     and the dismal noise of war. What melancholy is impressed\r\n     upon the beautiful forest of Soignies! I cannot overcome the\r\n     idea, that since Providence destined it should become the\r\n     mute spectator of the great event in its vicinity, it has\r\n     retained the mysterious memory in the folding of its leaves\r\n     and the depths of its shades. Destiny designs the theatre\r\n     for grand actions. An army of one hundred thousand men\r\n     perished there. Such was the irrevocable decree.\r\n\r\n     \"Do you think,\" I inquired of the coachman, wishing to\r\n     change the current of my thoughts, \"there are persons so\r\n     unscrupulous as to speculate on the curiosity of tourists to\r\n     Waterloo in the manner you have described?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Ah, sir,\" he replied, \"I have not told you half the tricks\r\n     they practice on the credulous. It would indeed fatigue you\r\n     if I mentioned all of them, but if you will permit me, I\r\n     will relate an instance I witnessed myself one day. I was\r\n     conducting from Waterloo to Brussels a French artist and a\r\n     Prussian tourist. The Prussian supported on his knee some\r\n     object very carefully enveloped in a handkerchief, and which\r\n     he seemed to value greatly. When we had arrived about midway\r\n     on the road, he inquired of the Frenchman whether he had\r\n     brought away with him any souvenir of his pilgrimage to\r\n     Waterloo.\r\n\r\n     \"'In good faith no,' replied the other; and yet I was on the\r\n     point of making a certain acquisition, but the exorbitant\r\n     price demanded prevented me: one hundred francs, besides the\r\n     trouble of carrying off such an article.'\r\n\r\n     \"'What could it have been?' demanded the Prussian,\r\n     curiously.\r\n\r\n     \"'You must not feel offended if I tell you,' returned the\r\n     artist; 'it was the skull of a Prussian colonel, a\r\n     magnificent one! And what rendered it more valuable, it was\r\n     pierced by three holes, made by the balls of Waterloo. One\r\n     was in the forehead, the others were through the temples. I\r\n     should have had no objection to secure this, if I could have\r\n     afforded it, and have had a lamp made of the skull of a\r\n     Prussian officer killed by the French. And you, sir?' he\r\n     continued, looking at the packet carried by his\r\n     fellow-traveller, 'pray what luck have you had?'\r\n\r\n     \"'I,' replied the Prussian, with an uneasy movement, and\r\n     looking greatly confused, 'I am astonished at the wonderful\r\n     resemblance of what has happened to both of us, for I\r\n     purchased this morning the skull of a French colonel killed\r\n     by a Prussian at Waterloo.'\r\n\r\n     \"'You, sir?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Y--e--s,' stammered the Prussian, 'and I thought of having\r\n     it made into a cup to drink the health of Blucher at each\r\n     anniversary of our victory.'\r\n\r\n     \"'And is the skull pierced by three bullets?' demanded the\r\n     Frenchman, his suspicions becoming awakened.\r\n\r\n     \"With a look of consternation the Prussian hastily unrolled\r\n     the handkerchief, and examined the contents. The skull bore\r\n     the same marks indicated by his travelling companion! It was\r\n     the identical relic that was French when offered to an\r\n     Englishman or Prussian, and had become Prussian or English\r\n     when offered to a Frenchman.\r\n\r\n     \"This, sir,\" added Jehu, smacking his whip, \"you will admit,\r\n     is worse than selling false brass buttons and the Emperor's\r\n     eagles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES OF AMERICAN LITERATURE,\r\n\r\nBY PHILARETE CHASLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have frequently been interested by the clever contributions of M.\r\nPHILARETE CHASLES to the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. They are chiefly on\r\nEnglish and American literature, and among them are specimens of acute\r\nand genial criticism. M. Chasles has just published in Paris a\r\ncollection of these papers, and we translate for _The International_ a\r\nreviewal of it which appears in a late number of the French journal,\r\nthe _Illustration_. Says the writer, M. Hipolyte Babou:\r\n\r\nBooks are becoming scarce. To be sure, volume upon volume is published\r\nevery day, but a book that is a book is a _rara avis_, and if any one\r\nshould inquire whose fault it is, we reply that it is the fault of the\r\npress, constantly requiring the first-fruits of a writer's\r\nmeditations. The journalist has displaced the author. The fugitive\r\npage rules the great world of literature. Wit, talent, genius,\r\nscience, have not time to consolidate their thoughts, before they are\r\ndisseminated. They are like the folds of the birchen bark, thrown off\r\nas soon as formed, to give place to new ones. And these in their turn\r\nfall, and are scattered. But, when we wish it, we can collect our\r\nliterary leaves. How many handsome volumes are made up of weekly and\r\nmonthly pages! The binder runs his needle through a collection, and\r\nthe book is made.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of book? Ah, truly, it is not the venerable work of past\r\ndays, which took ten years to print and bring to perfection,\r\nestablishing at once a literary fame. It is simply a series of\r\narticles written by steam, printed by steam, and some bright morning\r\nbound up under a common title. But what is the story and the\r\nattraction of such works? Bless you! there is no story. The attraction\r\nis in the style (when there is any) and in the variety of subjects,\r\nwhich generally produces a variety of impressions.\r\n\r\nFor an ordinary reader, to whom continued attention produces headache,\r\nthere is nothing more agreeable than those album-pages, or fragments\r\nof mosaic. Thinking and serious minds turn rather towards works of\r\nconsecutive reflection, or whose details contribute to the beauty of\r\nsome whole. Variety is the wind to the weather-cock; and unity is the\r\ninflexible pivot which every weather-cock requires to keep it from\r\nbeing blown away. Thoughtful minds prefer unity above every thing. And\r\nyet they are only heavier weather-cocks, which turn round with a\r\ngrating.\r\n\r\nNervous and discursive reader! logical and phlegmatic reader! here is\r\na book which will suit you both. M. Philarete Chasles has just\r\npublished expressly for you his _Studies upon the Literature and\r\nManners of the Anglo-Americans in the Nineteenth Century_. It is a\r\nwork by compartments, any of them interesting to the superficial\r\nreader, and forming at the same time a perfect whole.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of a spirit of order, which professors by their\r\nvocation are very apt to possess in an eminent degree, the author has\r\ncomposed his work, not of articles written for journals, but by\r\ndetailing articles a work whose plan he had before considered. The\r\ngeneral design, to which he is obedient, is clearly developed, page by\r\npage, in his curious studies upon the Anglo-Americans.\r\n\r\nIt is a vile term--that of Anglo-American--a pedantic term--and rather\r\nsurprising from the pen of Chasles. For, professor as he is, he\r\ndespises pedantry as the plague. There is nothing doctoral in his\r\nliterary costume; and if he has any pretension, it resembles in no\r\nparticular the grave assumptions of the cathedrants of the university.\r\nIt would be a mortification to him to belong to the school of the\r\nSorbonne. He is a member of the free family of the College of France,\r\nwhere individual genius has triumphed more than once over the sterile\r\nroutine of tradition.\r\n\r\nBefore filling the chair of professor, the author of _Etudes_ had\r\nwritten much in journals and reviews. He writes still, and is always\r\nwelcome to the public. For, it may be remarked without malice, he has\r\nalways had a larger audience of readers than of listeners. And that it\r\nis so is rather complimentary than otherwise. How is it, indeed, that\r\nthe intellectual humorist succeeds better as an author than as a\r\nteacher? What does he need to insure, if he wishes it, the\r\nenthusiastic admiration of the young public whom he instructs? Has he\r\nnot at command those vivid flashings of the imagination which, by an\r\nelectric sympathy, might bring down about him thunders of applause? Is\r\nhe fearful that his gesture and his voice would not become his\r\nthought? Does he disdain to have recourse, hap-hazard, to the little\r\nartifices of eloquence? It is very easy to gain popularity by a\r\njuggle, when it cannot be done by the force of true oratory. Be\r\nenthusiastic of your merits. Mingle with the swellings of poetry a\r\ncertain dogmatism of opinion--call to your aid assurance, impudence,\r\nand all the insipidities of the _style printanier_--fire, as it were,\r\npistol-shots into the audience, and continue the fire by a brilliant\r\nmusketry of little fulminating phrases--the victory is yours, unless\r\nyou are essentially an ass. For youth--verdant youth--will always be\r\ncarried away by the expression, true or false, of feeling.\r\n\r\nM. Philarete Chasles is said to want in some degree that great\r\nconstituent of humanity--passion. He is one of those refined and\r\ndelicate writers who employ all their genius to ridicule the mind, and\r\nall their reason to drive to shipwreck upon the beautiful waters of\r\npoesie the most charming flotillas of the imagination. He belongs to\r\nthe breed of sharp raillers, whose skepticism points an epigram. In a\r\nword, there is no reverse side for his admiration on any question--a\r\nhabit of judging quite common among many writers, genuine and\r\ncharlatan.\r\n\r\nBut this is not saying that the author of _Etudes_ does not feel\r\ndeeply the irresistible attraction of the beau ideal; or that we are\r\ntreating of one of those representatives of pompous and stupid\r\ncriticism, who are so justly despised by the poets. Certainly not. On\r\nthe contrary, M. Chasles combines a vigorous hate of ornate folly and\r\nvulgarity with a profound disgust towards tame or extravagant\r\nconventionalism. The academic style has no fascination for him. He\r\nlikes elbow-room in the discussion of art, and if he finds himself\r\nconfined by the close-fitting coat of the professor, he rips it\r\nasunder, stretching out his arms in a fit of restlessness. A\r\nprotective literature regards him among its most resolute adversaries.\r\nNo custom-houses in literature for him, and particularly no excisemen,\r\nwho, under pretext of contraband, drive their brutal gauge-rods into\r\nthe free productions of human intelligence.\r\n\r\nM. Philarete Chasles is a literary disciple of Cobden. He would not\r\nonly lower the barriers between province and province, but wholly\r\nabolish them between nation and nation. His imagination carries him as\r\na balloon beyond the tops of custom-houses; and after visiting the\r\nshores of England and America, he returns to France with some curious\r\nsamples of foreign literature. By this come-and-go policy of\r\nimportation and exportation, he has created, or at least developed, a\r\nnoble spirit of commerce, which may be termed international criticism.\r\n\r\nThis commerce is particularly useful for us who are always ready to\r\nproclaim ourselves in every thing and to every one the first nation of\r\nthe globe. It is an auspicious time therefore to become acquainted\r\nwith the weaknesses of our character without losing its force. The\r\nglory of the past obliges us to think of the glory of the future,\r\nwhich can be easily lost to us if ambition does not come in time to\r\nanimate our courage. To deny that there are rivals is no way to\r\nconquer them. It is a great deal better to study them attentively, and\r\nto consider beforehand the perils of the combat. We are indeed the\r\nheroes of genius, but if we misapprehend the tactics, we say it\r\nfrankly, we shall be beaten.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Etudes_ wishes to spare us such a humiliation, by\r\ntelling us of the enemy as he is; and in this sense his work is truly\r\npatriotic, and cannot be unacceptable to any.\r\n\r\nMany writers have instituted a relation between us and the Latins and\r\nGreeks. M. Chasles thinks that to remember the glorious dead of the\r\nsouth is to engender contempt for the living. It is not then towards\r\nthe south that he directs his attention. The Saxon race, beyond the\r\nBritish Sea and the Atlantic, preoccupies him. The nations in\r\nprogress are those most hopeful for new and immortal productions of\r\nthe muse. The rest of the world is given to an incurable imitation.\r\nAnd M. Chasles is right in bringing us into the presence of the\r\nEnglish and the Americans. He is sufficiently conversant with their\r\nlanguage to fulfil the delicate functions of interpreter.\r\n\r\nI know writers who, on account of studying foreign literature, so bear\r\nthe imprints of it in their works, that one would say in reading them,\r\nthat he had before him French translations of Italian or German, or\r\nEnglish, or Spanish. The literary temperament of M. Chasles, however,\r\nis not changed, notwithstanding his migrations. The author of _Etudes_\r\nthinks in French, writes in French, and what is more, in French\r\ninherited from a Gaul. He preserves in his mind the brightness of his\r\nnative sky, whether he wanders in the fogs of London, or is becoming a\r\nvictim of ennui among the vapors of New-York. His pen seems to strike\r\nout sparks as he writes. He is active and bold, strong and light,\r\nindependent and courteous. Nothing stops him. He runs oftener than he\r\nwalks, and leaps over an obstacle that he may not lose time in going\r\nround it. Indeed, every thing is accomplished well by the intelligence\r\nthat judges as it travels. Reflection itself is rapid, and logic\r\nhastens the step and smooths the way. A light and tripping foot\r\nbelongs especially to criticism. If it raises a little brilliant dust\r\nin the road, it is no matter, it soon falls again. M. Chasles has no\r\ntaste for old truths; he prefers much some kind of paradox which is\r\nnow a truth and now a lie. It is for this reason that foreigners\r\nreproach him with being superficial. Very well! let him be so. He is a\r\ntrue Frenchman, for he touches only the flower of ideas, and, for a\r\nFrenchman, the flower and the surface are all one.\r\n\r\nIt is not just, however, to regard this reproach as wholly merited,\r\nalthough (originating beyond the British Sea) it is reproduced among\r\nus by those would-be grave men who are dull writers. M. Chasles often\r\nallies lightness of expression with great profundity of thought. His\r\nstyle cuts as a blade of steel. He has eloquence, gayety, irony,\r\ncaprice, and all in a perfect measure. No style resembles less the\r\nchildish dashes of persons of wit, and who possess nothing else--who\r\nplay the mountebank by a hundred tricks to astonish the gaping\r\ncrowd--a light style, if you please, but empty as it is light.\r\n\r\nThe _Etudes_ of M. Chasles are not of that superficial character\r\nadopted by many. The admiration of ninnies is not his desire. The\r\nobject that he pursues continues ever a serious one, although a\r\nthousand graces ornament the way. He has vivacity without losing\r\nprecision--two characteristics of good writing seldom found together.\r\nIf he indulges in digressions, they are not perceptible until the\r\nreappearance of his subject shows us how gracefully he has departed\r\nfrom it. He passes rapidly over what is known, while with an especial\r\ncare he dwells on what is unknown. Thus, in the history of American\r\nliterature he does not amuse himself long with the popular names of\r\nFenimore Cooper and Franklin. What could he say new respecting these\r\ntwo great ornaments of American science and literature? His instinct\r\nof observation and criticism suggested to him the works less known of\r\nGouverneur Morris and Hermann Melville. Between these two writers, of\r\nwhom one was the contemporary of Washington, and the other still\r\nliving in some corner of Massachusetts, are ranged according to their\r\ndate the productions of the writers of the great American nation.\r\n\r\nGouverneur Morris was of a noble spirit. His _Memoires_ represent to\r\nus, with a full and attractive fidelity, the opinion which the young\r\nand tranquil republic of the United States entertained at the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century, of the men and the events of our French\r\nRevolution. He was far from misunderstanding the abuses of our ancient\r\nsociety, but he deplored that it was necessary for violence to abolish\r\nthem. A sensible and polished observer, he criticised them without\r\npassion, and with a benevolent irony. Let us hear him tell of a\r\nconversation he had, at Madame de la Suze's, with one of the most\r\nbrilliant leaders of the gay world that had just perished. In a few\r\nlines, he presents an admirable sketch of the personage:\r\n\r\n     'The rest of our party were playing at cards, and quite\r\n     absorbed in the game, when M. de Boufflers, in want of\r\n     something better to do, spoke to me of America. The\r\n     carelessness with which he heard me proved that he did not\r\n     pay the least attention to what he had asked me.\r\n\r\n     --\"But how could you defend your country from invasion\r\n     without fleets and armies?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Nothing could be more difficult,\" replied Morris, \"than to\r\n     subjugate a nation composed of kings, and who, if looked\r\n     upon contemptuously, would respond: '_I am a man; are you\r\n     any thing more?_'\"\r\n\r\n     \"Very well,\" said M. de Boufflers. \"But how would you like\r\n     it, if I should say to one of those citizen-kings: Monsieur,\r\n     the king, make me a pair of boots!\"\r\n\r\n     \"My compatriot,\" said Morris, \"would not hesitate to reply:\r\n     'With great pleasure, sir. It is my duty and my vocation to\r\n     make boots, and I could wish that every one would do his\r\n     duty in this world.\"'\r\n\r\nM. de Boufflers looked up to the ceiling as if in search of a solution\r\nof this enigma, and Morris contemplated him, as much surprised as if,\r\nin the forests of the New World, he had heard a humming-bird reason of\r\nthe affairs of the Republic. And it was thus with all that class of\r\nmen--the same elegance--the same luxury--the same prattle--the same\r\nheedlessness. All these courtiers of the last hour resembled precisely\r\nM. de Boufflers. The same day, indeed, of the taking of the Bastile,\r\nMorris traced two lines upon the tablettes:\r\n\r\n     \"It is very well that the court should appear to believe\r\n     that all is tranquil; but to-morrow, perhaps, when the\r\n     citadelle is in flames, they will agree that there has been\r\n     some noise in Paris.\"\r\n\r\nSome time before, the grave and gentle American had met Madame de\r\nStael at Madame de Tesse's; the daughter of Necker conversed with him\r\nin another style than that of M. de Boufflers. However, quite serious\r\nas Corinne certainly was, the dignity of the compatriot of Washington\r\nsurprised and diverted her.\r\n\r\n     \"Monsieur,\" she said, after a moment's conversation, \"you\r\n     have a very imposing air.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I know it, Madame,\" replied Morris.\r\n\r\nThe English literature constantly serves M. Chasles, to bring into\r\nrelief the character of American literature. And thus, he opposes the\r\npeaceful inspirations of the work-girls of Lowell with the passionate\r\ndithyrambics of Ebenezer Elliott, the blacksmith of Sheffield--a\r\nchapter full of just remarks upon what Chasles calls the poetry of\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nThe girls of Lowell--the Lucindas, the Alleghanias, the Tancredas, the\r\nVelledas--who, after a day's labor, pass into the street in silken\r\ndresses, with gold watches shining at their zone, and their beautiful\r\nfaces shaded by parasols--those Massachusetts weavers, who have even\r\ninstituted an academy among themselves--do not in their innocent\r\nverses, invoke the vengeful muses. They know nothing of that terrible\r\nNemesis, with cheeks hollow and ghastly, armed hands, and eyes red\r\nwith poverty and weeping, to whom the poor workers of British\r\nfactories send up the cry of famine and despair. If the female\r\noperatives of Lowell read the work of M. Philarete Chasles, they will\r\nfind there an encouragement to cultivate the smiling thoughts of\r\npoetry. He, no more than George Sand, notwithstanding her sympathies\r\nfor the working classes, either loves or encourages the irritable\r\nsingers of social sufferings.\r\n\r\n     \"What,\" he exclaims, \"has become of the glorious Apollo of\r\n     the Greek? Where is the sunny ideal of the hellenistic\r\n     heavens? Where the sacred sorrows of Christian perfection?\r\n     Poetry is no more a garden of roses; it is a wild field of\r\n     thorns, wherein he who walks leaves tracks of blood. At the\r\n     entrance of this Parnassus stands Poverty, whom Virgil\r\n     places _in faucibus orci_. Her complaints are in the midst\r\n     of curses. She holds in her hand a skull, with strings of\r\n     iron, and she sweeps them as a lyre with golden chords.\r\n     Behind her are Crabbe, the Juvenal of the hospitals;\r\n     Ebenezer Elliott, the singer of hunger; Cooper, the poet of\r\n     suicide, and the author of _Ernest_, followed by a miserable\r\n     train of children, whom manufacturers have famished, and\r\n     young women whom excessive labor has demoralized and\r\n     prostituted in the morning of their life. Mournful choir, to\r\n     which these poets worthily respond.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not very pleasant, to be sure, for a reader to pass from some\r\nagreeable representation to a frightful array of evils. The spectacle\r\nbut too true of social infirmities troubles the sleep of the happy,\r\nand awakes with a start the drowsy hate of the unhappy. But there is\r\nno reason why he who suffers, should not utter his complaint. The\r\nBible itself is not a stranger to vehement protestations against the\r\napparent injustice of destiny. When Job arose from the ashes, surely\r\nit was not to sing to the passers-by some touching idylle in the style\r\nof Ruth and Naomi. He accused heaven and life, he cursed his friends,\r\nand his mother, without troubling himself to know whether his sorrows\r\nreached the lovers' palm-groves, or disturbed the wooings of the\r\ndaughters of Idumea. The Sheffield blacksmith, among flaming furnaces,\r\ncannot sing the voluptuous sweets of existence. He strikes the anvil\r\nwith a ring, and exclaims in a rough voice, amid smoke and fire:\r\n\r\n     \"Accursed be the muse of necessity and suffering! Who wishes\r\n     her acquaintance? The poor, so despised! Write not their\r\n     frightful history. Pride and vanity despise your labors. Who\r\n     is he, I pray you, that artizan who uses the pen? What right\r\n     has he to do so? Absurd rhymer, let him retire and pare his\r\n     nails--and renounce a species of industry for which he was\r\n     never made. You are accustomed only to oaths, and you are\r\n     only a rough worker in poetry.\"\r\n\r\nM. Chasles does not deny the right of artizans to employ the pen.\r\nIgnoble or noble--a serf or a lord--whether he is called Burns, or\r\nChasles of Orleans--whether he is a porter, a laborer, or even a\r\ndrunkard, from the moment that there is seen upon his brow the radiant\r\nsign of genius, he is known. To wonder that an artizan is a poet, is\r\nto think it marvellous that beauty should bloom upon the cheek of a\r\nvillage maid. The gift is natural, and not acquired; and the mechanic\r\nwho writes either prose or poetry must be judged with as much severity\r\nas if he were a king. It is not astonishing, therefore, that the\r\nauthor of the _Etudes_ judges severely the blacksmith of Sheffield.\r\nBut the latter seems to have anticipated the severity of the critic,\r\nwhen he says with an accent of the most mournful bitterness:\r\n\r\n     \"Do not read me, ye who love elegance and grace. Alight not,\r\n     ye butterflies, among thorns--nor upon rocks burning in the\r\n     sun and beaten by the rains--you may tarnish the gauze of\r\n     your beautiful wings. But you who honor truth, follow me. I\r\n     will bring you wild flowers, gathered from the precipice,\r\n     amid howling tempests.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we inhale the perfume of the _flowers of the heath_, we can\r\nhonor truth, without being _foolish flies_, and without renouncing the\r\nlove of the _elegant and graceful_. Not less did M. Chasles write to\r\nthe _Journal des Debats_, a little before the revolution, in those\r\ngenerous words which we are happy to see again in his book:\r\n\r\n     \"It is for you, politicians, to find a remedy for the evils\r\n     of society. The interests of the masses are in your\r\n     hands--those who have not enough to eat, and too much work.\r\n     The verses of famished workmen, which we cannot sing, we\r\n     weep over. The muse of Cooper, of Elliott, and of Crabbe,\r\n     is not a muse, but a fury. You are reminded, that in\r\n     accumulating wealth in one direction, you are increasing\r\n     poverty in another; and that the poverty which complains at\r\n     first avenges itself afterward.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know whether these words were prophetic, but I see in them a\r\nnoble sentiment, unfortunately too rare among those who love elegance\r\nand grace. Let us be elegant, if we can; gracious, if we know how.\r\nBut, besides those desirable qualities of the old French society, let\r\nus show in the light of heaven that living active charity which only\r\ncan strengthen by purifying the existence of the new order of society.\r\nThe grandchildren of Boufflers, we expose ourselves no more to\r\nridicule in saying: \"Monsieur le roi, faite-moi une paire de\r\nsouliers.\" The king will make the shoes if it is his vocation. The\r\ngrandchildren of Boufflers should do their duty--that is to say:\r\ncontribute with all their mind to find out, according to the\r\nexpression of Chasles, efficacious remedies for social evils. When\r\nworkmen are more happy, they will write less poetry, or at least they\r\nwill write more calmly. See the American spinners of Lowell. Ah!\r\nLucinda or Tancreda has never lifted up her voice to heaven with the\r\ndespair of Elliott. An amorous complaint suffices her; a sonnet, or a\r\nlove-sigh, breathed by the light of the stars, consoles her for the\r\nlabors of the day. American society works first; when it has conquered\r\nan independence, it sings. All Americans do not accept the saying of\r\none of their journalists: \"Political and practical life is sufficient\r\nfor man. Imagination is a peril--arts a misfortune.\" So far from\r\nproscribing the arts and imagination, Cooper, Irving, Audubon, and\r\nmany others are among those who have magnified the literature of their\r\ncountry. But the greater part, with that fruitful wisdom which\r\ncharacterizes them, applaud the advice of Channing:\r\n\r\n     \"I made a resolution of presenting a gift to my country in\r\n     the form of an epic. But I had prudence enough to postpone\r\n     it until I should have a fortune. I then commenced to make\r\n     my business known, after which I retired into solitude with\r\n     my imagination.\"\r\n\r\nIn Europe it is just the contrary. We ask the imagination to make our\r\nbusiness known, and we retire into solitude with our fortune or our\r\npoverty. Which course avails the more for our glory? Which for our\r\nrepose?\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the work of M. Chasles is, that our literature, our\r\nmanners, our nationality even, will some day disappear before the\r\nrising glory of the great Western Republic, but I can declare without\r\nemotion that I have no fear of my country. America offers us examples;\r\nwe also have some to offer her. The future of the United States is\r\ndeveloped day by day in a manner that astonishes Europe. But\r\nnotwithstanding the _patriotes de clocher_, and French _humanitaires_\r\nwho suppress the very word native country, I believe in the higher\r\ndestinies of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PHANTASY.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY R. H. STODDARD.\r\n\r\n    \"Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    The light of the summer noon\r\n      Bursts in a flood through the blind;\r\n    But few are the rays of joy\r\n      That shine in my darkened mind.\r\n\r\n    My heart is stirred to a storm,\r\n      And its passions intense and proud\r\n    Feed on themselves, like fires\r\n      Pent in a thunder-cloud!\r\n\r\n    I think of the days of youth,\r\n      And the fountains of love defiled,\r\n    Till I hide my face in my hands,\r\n      And weep like a little child!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIMES OF CHARLEMAGNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Francis Palgrave's _History of Normandy and of England_, of which\r\nthe first volume has just appeared in London, is unquestionably a very\r\nimportant work, illustrating a period of which comparatively little\r\nhas been known, and of which a knowledge is eminently necessary to the\r\nstudent of British institutions and manners. The subject has been\r\npartially handled by French authors--by Thierry, Guizot, Michelet, and\r\nin a desultory manner by M. Barante--but not one of these has shown\r\nthe very intimate relation that exists between the history of Normandy\r\nand of England. That intermixture of the histories of the countries\r\nmay indeed be inferred from old English works, such as Camden,\r\nFortescue, Hale, Britton, Bracton, Fleta, Spelman, Somner, Chief Baron\r\nGilbert, Daines Barrington, and others, and from labors of Bede,\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury, Geoffry of Monmouth, and all the older\r\nchroniclers. But not one of these writers, in all their varied labors,\r\nhas undertaken to show how the histories of the two countries act and\r\nre-act on each other, or how, represented in the popular mind by the\r\nepithets Norman and Saxon, French and English, they have been for a\r\nthousand years or more running against each other a perpetual race of\r\nrivalry and emulation. A worthy Picard lawyer indeed, of the name of\r\nGaillard, who abandoned the law for literature about a century ago,\r\nwrote a work called _The Rivalry between France and England_, in\r\neleven volumes; but who, in 1851, unless specially dedicated to\r\nhistorical studies, would read a French history on the subject of the\r\nrivalry between the two nations, written between 1771 and 1777,\r\nespecially when it extends to eleven volumes? Independently of this,\r\nany French history on such subject is sure to be tinged with\r\nprejudice, passion, and vanity. It is true that the judicious Sharon\r\nTurner, in his _History of the Anglo-Saxons_, Henry Wheaton, in his\r\n_History of the Northmen_, and M. Capefigue, give us more or less\r\ninsight into Norman history; but none of these authors attempt to show\r\nthe general relations of mediaeval history, or that absolute need of\r\nuniting Norman to English history, which it is the chief aim of Sir\r\nFrancis Palgrave to demonstrate. As deputy keeper of the public\r\nrecords of England, this learned historian has had the best possible\r\nopportunities of investigation, and he tells us in his preface that\r\nhe has devoted to the work a full quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nThe style of Sir Francis Palgrave is generally heavy, and his work\r\nwill therefore be more prized by students than by the mere lovers of\r\nliterature. His manner and spirit and the character of his performance\r\nmay be most satisfactorily exhibited in a few specimen paragraphs,\r\nhowever, and we proceed to quote, first, from an introductory\r\ndissertation, some remarks on the arts, architecture, and civilization\r\nof Rome. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"Roman taste gave the fashion to the garment, Roman skill\r\n     the models for the instruments of war. We have been told to\r\n     seek in the forests of Germany the origin of the feudal\r\n     system and the conception of the Gothic aisle. We shall\r\n     discover neither there. Architecture is the costume of\r\n     society, and throughout European Christendom that costume\r\n     was patterned from Rome. Unapt and unskilful pupils, she\r\n     taught the Ostrogothic workman to plan the palace of\r\n     Theodoric; the Frank, to decorate the hall of Charlemagne;\r\n     the Lombard, to vault the duomo; the Norman, to design the\r\n     cathedral. Above all, Rome imparted to our European\r\n     civilization her luxury, her grandeur, her richness, her\r\n     splendor, her exaltation of human reason, her spirit of free\r\n     inquiry, her ready mutability, her unwearied activity, her\r\n     expansive and devouring energy, her hardness of heart, her\r\n     intellectual pride, her fierceness, her insatiate cruelty,\r\n     that unrelenting cruelty which expels all other races out of\r\n     the very pale of humanity; whilst our direction of thought,\r\n     our literature, our languages, concur in uniting the\r\n     dominions, kingdoms, states, principalities, and powers,\r\n     composing our civilized commonwealth in the Old Continent\r\n     and the New, with the terrible people through whom that\r\n     civilized commonwealth wields the thunderbolts of the\r\n     dreadful monarchy, diverse from all others which preceded\r\n     amongst mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is our author's view of the real and the ideal\r\nCharlemagne:--\r\n\r\n     \"It seems Charlemagne's fate that he should always be in\r\n     danger of shading into a mythic monarch--not a man of flesh\r\n     and blood, but a personified theory. Turpin's Carolus\r\n     Magnus, the Charlemagne of Roncesvalles; Ariosto's _Sacra\r\n     Corona_, surrounded by Palatines and Doze-Piers, are\r\n     scarcely more unlike the real rough, tough, shaggy, old\r\n     monarch, than the conventional portraitures by which his\r\n     real features have been supplanted.\r\n\r\n     \"It is an insuperable source of fallacy in human observation\r\n     as well as in human judgment, that we never can sufficiently\r\n     disjoin our own individuality from our estimates of moral\r\n     nature. Admiring ourselves in others, we ascribe to those\r\n     whom we love or admire the qualities we value in ourselves.\r\n     We each see the landscape through our own stripe of the\r\n     rainbow. A favorite hero by long-established prescription,\r\n     few historical characters have been more disguised by fond\r\n     adornment than Charlemagne. Each generation or school has\r\n     endeavored to exhibit him as a normal model of excellence:\r\n     Courtly Mezeray invests the son of Pepin with the taste of\r\n     Louis Quatorze; the polished Abbe Velly bestows upon the\r\n     Frankish emperor the abstract perfection of a dramatic hero;\r\n     Boulainvilliers, the champion of the noblesse, worships the\r\n     founder of hereditary feudality; Mably discovers in the\r\n     capitulars the maxims of popular liberty; Montesquieu, the\r\n     perfect philosophy of legislation. But, generally speaking,\r\n     Charlemagne's historical aspect is derived from his\r\n     patronage of literature. This notion of his literary\r\n     character colors his political character, so that in the\r\n     assumption of the imperial authority, we are fain to\r\n     consider him as a true romanticist--such as in our own days\r\n     we have seen upon the throne--seeking to appease hungry\r\n     desires by playing with poetic fancies, to satisfy hard\r\n     nature with pleasant words, to give substance and body to a\r\n     dream.\r\n\r\n     \"All these prestiges will vanish if we render to Charlemagne\r\n     his well deserved encomium:--he was a great warrior, a great\r\n     statesman, fitted for his own age. It is a very ambiguous\r\n     praise to say that a man is in advance of his age; if so, he\r\n     is out of his place; he lives in a foreign country. Equally\r\n     so, if he lives in the past. No innovator so bold, so\r\n     reckless, and so crude, as he who makes the attempt (which\r\n     never succeeds) to effect a resurrection of antiquity.\"\r\n\r\nThe practical character of Charlemagne is thus sketched:--\r\n\r\n     \"We may put by the book, and study Charlemagne's\r\n     achievements on the borders of the Rhine; better than in the\r\n     book may the traveller see Charlemagne's genuine character\r\n     pictured upon the lovely unfolding landscape: the huge\r\n     domminsters, the fortresses of religion; the yellow sunny\r\n     rocks studded with the vine; the mulberry and the peach,\r\n     ripening in the ruddy orchards; the succulent potherbs and\r\n     worts which stock the Bauer's garden,--these are the\r\n     monuments and memorials of Charlemagne's mind. The first\r\n     health pledged when the flask is opened at Johannisberg\r\n     should be the monarchs name who gave the song-inspiring\r\n     vintage. Charlemagne's superiority and ability consisted\r\n     chiefly in seeking and seizing the immediate advantages,\r\n     whatever they might be which he could confer upon others or\r\n     obtain for himself. He was a man of forethought, ready\r\n     contrivance, and useful talent. He would employ every\r\n     expedient, grasp every opportunity, and provide for each day\r\n     as it was passing by.\r\n\r\n     \"The educational movement resulting from Charlemagne's\r\n     genius was practical. Two main objects had he therein upon\r\n     his conscience and his mind. The first, was the support of\r\n     the Christian Faith; his seven liberal sciences circled\r\n     round theology, the centre of the intellectual system. No\r\n     argument was needed as to the obligation of uniting sacred\r\n     and secular learning, because the idea of disuniting them\r\n     never was entertained. His other object in patronizing\r\n     learning and instruction was the benefit of the State. He\r\n     sought to train good men of business; judges well qualified,\r\n     ready penmen in his chancery; and this sage desire expanded\r\n     into a wide instructional field. Charlemagne's exertions for\r\n     promoting the study of the Greek language--his Greek\r\n     professorships at Osnaburgh or Saltzburgh--have been\r\n     praised, doubted, discussed, as something very paradoxical;\r\n     whereas, his motives were plain, and his machinery simple.\r\n     Greek was, to all intents and purposes, the current language\r\n     of an opulent and powerful nation, required for the\r\n     transaction of public affairs. A close parallel,\r\n     necessitated by the same causes, exists in the capital of\r\n     Charlemagne's successors. The Oriental Academy at Vienna is\r\n     constituted to afford a supply of individuals qualified for\r\n     the diplomatic intercourse, arising out of the vicinity and\r\n     relations of the Austrian and Ottoman dominions, without any\r\n     reference to the promotion of philology. We find the same at\r\n     home. If the Persian language be taught at Haileybury, it is\r\n     to fit the future Writer of his Indian office. He may study\r\n     Ferduzi or Hafiz, if he pleases, but the cultivation of\r\n     literature is not the intent with which the learning is\r\n     bestowed.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the manner in which Sir Francis Palgrave contrasts and\r\ncompares the two emperors, Charlemagne and Napoleon:--\r\n\r\n     \"Napoleon sought the creation of an anti-christian imperial\r\n     pontificate--the caliphate of positive civilization; his\r\n     aspiration was the establishment of absolute dominion,\r\n     corporeal and intellectual; mastery over body and soul;\r\n     faith respected only as an influential and venerable\r\n     delusion; the aiding powers of religion accepted until she\r\n     should be chilled out, and the unfed flame expire, and\r\n     positive philosophy complete her task of emancipating the\r\n     matured intellect from the remaining swathing bands which\r\n     had been needful during the infancy of human society. And\r\n     the theories of Charlemagne and Napoleon, though\r\n     irreconcileably antagonistic, in their conception, would,\r\n     were either fully developed, become identical in their\r\n     result, notwithstanding their contrarieties. They start in\r\n     opposite directions, but, circling round their courses,\r\n     would--were it permitted that they should persevere\r\n     continuously and consistently--meet at the same point of\r\n     convergence, and attain the same end.\r\n\r\n     \"Moreover, the territorial empires of Napoleon and\r\n     Charlemagne had their organically fatal characteristics in\r\n     common. Each founder attempted to accomplish political\r\n     impossibilities--to conjoin communities unsusceptible of\r\n     amalgamation; to harmonize the discordant elements which\r\n     could only be kept together by external force, whilst their\r\n     internal forces sprung them asunder--a unity without\r\n     internal union. But even as the wonderful agencies revealed\r\n     to modern chemistry effect, in a short hour, the progresses\r\n     which nature silently elaborates during a long growth of\r\n     time, so in like manner did the energies of civilization\r\n     effect in three years that dissolution for which, in the\r\n     analogous precedent, seven generations were required.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECORATIVE ARTS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth of the fine arts, commonly so called, in this country, has\r\nbeen a fruitful subject of congratulatory observation in the last\r\ndozen years. The opera in that time has gained a permanent home here,\r\nand our sculptors and painters have gone out into the old fields of\r\nart, and claimed equality with their masters--an equality which Italy,\r\nGermany, France, and even England, slowly and reluctantly in some\r\ncases, but in the presence of the works of Powers, Crawford,\r\nGreenough, Leutze, and others, have, at length, confessed. In\r\npainting, as everybody knows, with few exceptions our best works have\r\nnever been seen abroad, and the advance of design here is therefore to\r\nbe studied only in our own exhibitions, hung with the productions of\r\nDurand, Huntington, Eliott, and the crowd of young painters coming\r\nforward every season to claim the approval of the people. The general\r\ntaste keeps pace with every achievement. We hear that the Art-Union\r\nwas never visited so much as this year; and private galleries, and\r\nthose of every dealer in works of art, are thronged. The existence in\r\nour principal cities, under the control of men of cultivation, of\r\nstores for the sale of works in the fine arts, is a fact eminently\r\nsignificant. That of Williams & Stevens, in Broadway, for example,\r\ncould be sustained only by a community in which there is a refinement\r\nof taste such as a few years ago could be found only in limited\r\ncircles in this country. Beginning with efforts to introduce the\r\nfinest forms and combinations in looking-glass and picture frames, the\r\nproprietors of this establishment have made it a great market-house\r\nfor artists, and the display upon its walls and in its windows is\r\nfrequently more attractive to the connoisseur than the exhibitions of\r\nthe Academies or the Art-Unions. And it is astonishing how many of the\r\nbest works of the European engravers--works which may justly be called\r\ncopies of the master-pieces of contemporary foreign art--are sold\r\nhere, to adorn houses from which the tawdry ornaments in vogue a few\r\nyears ago have been discarded. The same observations may be made in\r\nregard to furniture. The graceful styles and high finish to be seen at\r\nmany of our stores, and in our recently furnished houses, illustrate a\r\nprogress in elegance, luxury, and taste, not dreamed of by the last\r\ngeneration. And in all these things it is observable that the advance\r\nis in cheapness as well as in beauty. In this respect indeed we have\r\nscarcely kept pace with the French and English, but the cost at which\r\na man of taste and a little tact can now furnish a house, so that it\r\nshall illustrate not only his own refinement but the condition of the\r\nbest civilization of the time, is astonishingly small, compared with\r\nwhat it was a few years ago. The fine engraving, with its appropriate\r\nframe, to be bought for thirty dollars, is to be much preferred before\r\nthe portrait or indeed before any painting whatever that is\r\npurchasable for a hundred dollars; and though silver is unquestionably\r\nsilver, the imitation table furniture, of the most classical shapes,\r\nthat is sold now for a fifth of the cost of the coinable metal, looks\r\nquite as well upon a salver. The arts by which beauty is made familiar\r\nin the homes of all classes of people are of all arts most deserving\r\nof encouragement, and it is among the happiest of omens that they are\r\nreceiving so much attention--far more attention now than they have\r\never before received in America. We shall hereafter attempt a more\r\nparticular exhibition of this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE LATE DR. JOHN LINGARD.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY REV. J. C. RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoticing in the journals some brief but very just remarks upon the\r\ncharacter of the eminent Roman Catholic historian of England, who died\r\nJuly 17th, at the good old age of more than four-score years, I am\r\ninduced to think that an account of a visit which I had the honor to\r\nmake this celebrated scholar, may not be altogether without interest\r\nfor your readers.\r\n\r\nMarch 12, 1850, having a leisure day at Lancaster, and having already\r\nvisited John of Gaunt's castle, in company with several of those\r\ngenial spirits who afford me an unusually delightful social\r\nremembrance of the dingy buildings and narrow crooked streets of that\r\nfamous old town, one of them happened to mention the name of Dr.\r\nLingard. I instantly inquired after him with interest, and, observing\r\nmy enthusiasm, Mr. T. J---- proposed a drive to his residence at\r\nHornby, a village some twelve or thirteen miles distant. I of course\r\ngladly acceded to the proposal, and we were soon on our way, with a\r\nfleet horse, over the absolutely perfect English turnpike road--for\r\nthe roads in England are always passable, and not \"_improved_,\" like\r\nsome of those around New-York, in so continued a manner as to be\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nAfter a fine rural drive, crossing the river Loon, and through\r\nLonsdale, we came within sight of an old church and castle. I took the\r\nchurch to be that of the historian, but found, to my surprise, that\r\nthe famous old sage was placed in entire seclusion, and ministered to\r\na very few, and those very poor, sheep, in a little chapel, or room,\r\nunder his own roof. In this remote and by no means picturesque\r\nvillage, at an antiquated house, we knocked, and were told by the aged\r\ndomestic that the venerable historian had been very feeble of late,\r\nand had gone out, on this fine day in the spring, for a walk. After\r\nmany inquiries among the villagers, by whom he was as well known as\r\nbeloved, I proposed to take the line of the new railway, and, after\r\nquite a walk, met a feeble old man, with a scholar's face, a bright\r\ntwinkling black eye, supporting his steps on a staff, and wrapped up\r\nwith all the care which an aged and faithful housekeeper could bestow\r\nupon a long-tried and most indulgent master. I pronounced his name,\r\nand gave him my own; stated that I was a presbyter in the holy (though\r\nnot Roman) Catholic church, that I had long admired his integrity and\r\nfaithfulness as an historian, and that it was by no means the least of\r\nmy happy days in England that I was now permitted to speak to him face\r\nto face. The kind and gentle old man seemed truly astonished that any\r\none who had come so far, and seen so much, should care for seeing\r\n_him_, and rewarded my enthusiasm with a hearty grasp of the hand that\r\nhad wielded so admired a pen. We then walked on together towards his\r\nhouse, and you will not blame me for saying, that I was proud to offer\r\nthe support of my arm to this fine octogenarian, who had not suffered\r\nthe spirit of the priest to becloud the candor of the historian. We\r\nconversed with the greatest freedom upon our points of difference, and\r\nhe repeated to me, personally, _his entire disbelief in the fable of\r\nthe nag's head ordination_. He seemed to be only _historically_ aware\r\nof a disruption between us, for the benevolence of his heart would\r\nacknowledge no actual difference.\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from quoting a somewhat amusing illustration of his\r\ninfinite and childlike simplicity of character, combined with an utter\r\nignorance of those rudiments of modern science which would be much\r\nmore familiar to our district school-boys than to many men educated in\r\nthose classic homes of ancient learning, the English universities.\r\nSome posts had been set in the ground, and were bound together, for\r\nstrength, by iron wires; and the venerable sage said, \"I suppose this\r\nis the Electric Telegraph.\" I was obliged to insist with a kind of\r\nexplanatory and playful pertinacity, that this supposition must be\r\nincorrect, because electricity could not be conducted, unless the\r\nwires were at least continued _through_ the thick posts, instead of\r\nbeing wound _around_ them. At his house, we found the study not very\r\nwell supplied with books, for the aged scholar had now almost ceased\r\nto peruse these. At my request he wrote out very slowly, but in a\r\nwonderfully distinct hand for eighty, his own name and the date, \"John\r\nLingard, Hornby, March 12, 1850;\" and voluntarily added a Latin\r\npunning inscription, which he had made the evening before, which he\r\nhumorously proposed to have engraved upon the new Menai bridge. In\r\nthis he had spoken of the _builder of the bridge_, the celebrated\r\nStephens, as _Pontifex Maximus_. I need not say that I shall preserve\r\nthese papers among the most precious of my English mementos. I was\r\nsorry I could have no hopes that the branch which he gave me from the\r\ntree that he had transplanted with his own hands from the battle-field\r\nof Cannae to the quiet of his garden at Hornby, would ever flourish in\r\nAmerica. After many hospitable invitations, which other engagements\r\nobliged us to decline, and many modest expressions of the gratitude\r\nwhich he seemed deeply to feel for the pains that I had taken to come\r\nso far to visit him, we bade farewell to the candid priest, who began,\r\nas he told me, an essay to defend his Church against the aspersions of\r\nHume, and had ended by producing a voluminous as well as luminous\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[For another part of this magazine we have compiled a more full and\r\naccurate account of the life of the deceased scholar than has hitherto\r\nappeared in this country. See _Recent Deaths_, _post_, 285-6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVATE LIFE OF JOHN C. CALHOUN.\r\n\r\nADDRESSED TO HER BROTHER, AND COMMUNICATED TO THE INTERNATIONAL\r\nMAGAZINE,\r\n\r\nBY MISS M. BATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funeral rites of the lamented Calhoun have been performed. So\r\ndeeply has the mournful pageant impressed me, so vividly have memories\r\nof the past been recalled, that I am incapable of thinking or writing\r\non any other theme. My heart prompts me to garner up my recollections\r\nof this illustrious statesman. I can better preserve these invaluable\r\nmemories by committing them to paper, and as you enjoyed but one brief\r\ninterview with Mr. Calhoun, these pages shall be addressed to you.\r\n\r\nAn eloquent member of the House of Representatives, from your state,\r\nhas compared this southern luminary to that remarkable constellation\r\nthe Southern Cross. A few years since, in sailing to a West Indian\r\nisland, I had a perilous voyage, but have ever felt that the sight of\r\nthat Southern Cross, which had long haunted my imagination, almost\r\nrepaid me for its excitement and suffering. And thus do I regard an\r\nacquaintance with this intellectual star as one great compensation for\r\na separation from my early home. It would have been a loss not to have\r\nseen that poetic group, which greets the traveller as he sails\r\nsouthward, but how much greater the loss, never to have beheld that\r\nunique luminary which has set to rise no more upon our visible\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun's public character is so well known to you that I shall\r\nspeak of him principally in his private relations, and shall refer to\r\nhis opinions only as expressed in conversation--for it was in the\r\nrepose of his happy home, in the tranquillity of domestic life, and in\r\nthe freedom of social intercourse, that I knew him.\r\n\r\nWhile the clarion-notes of his fame resound among the distant hills\r\nand valleys of our land, while those who in political strife crossed\r\nlances with this champion of the south nobly acknowledge his valor and\r\nhis honor, while Carolina chants a requiem for her departed dead, may\r\nnot one who knows his moral elevation, and who has witnessed his\r\ndomestic virtues, have the consolation of adding an unaffected tribute\r\nto his memory? While his devoted constituents, with impressive symbols\r\nand mournful pageants, perform funereal rites, erect for him the\r\ncostly marble, weave for him the brilliant chaplet, be it mine to\r\nscatter over his honored tomb simple but ever green leaflets. While in\r\nglowing colors the orator portrays him on his peerless career in the\r\npolitical arena, be it mine to delineate the daily beauty of his life.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Calhoun were united the simple habits of the Spartan lawgiver,\r\nthe inflexible principles of the Roman senator, the courteous bearing\r\nand indulgent kindness of the American host, husband, and father. This\r\nwas indeed a rare union. Life with him was solemn and earnest, and yet\r\nall about him was cheerful. I never heard him utter a jest; there was\r\nan unvarying dignity and gravity in his manner; and yet the playful\r\nchild regarded him fearlessly and lovingly. Few men indulge their\r\nfamilies in as free, confidential, and familiar intercourse as did\r\nthis great statesman. Indeed, to those who had an opportunity of\r\nobserving him in his own house, it was evident that his cheerful and\r\nhappy home had attractions for him superior to those which any other\r\nplace could offer. Here was a retreat from the cares, the observation,\r\nand the homage of the world. In few homes could the transient visitor\r\nfeel more at ease than did the guest at Fort Hill. Those who knew Mr.\r\nCalhoun only by his senatorial speeches may suppose that his heart and\r\nmind were all engrossed in the nation's councils, but there were\r\nmoments when his courtesy, his minute kindnesses, made you forget the\r\nstatesman. The choicest fruits were selected for his guest; and I\r\nremember seeing him at his daughter's wedding take the ornaments from\r\na cake and send them to a little child. Many such graceful attentions,\r\noffered in an unostentatious manner to all about him, illustrated the\r\nkindness and noble simplicity of his nature. His family could not but\r\nexult in his intellectual greatness, his rare endowments, and his\r\nlofty career, yet they seemed to lose sight of all these in their love\r\nfor him. I had once the pleasure of travelling with his eldest son,\r\nwho related to me many interesting facts and traits of his life. He\r\nsaid he had never heard him speak impatiently to any member of his\r\nfamily. He mentioned that as he was leaving that morning for his home\r\nin Alabama, a younger brother said, \"Come soon again, and see us,\r\nbrother A----, for do you not see that father is growing old, and is\r\nnot father the dearest, best old man in the world!\"\r\n\r\nLike Cincinnatus, he enjoyed rural life and occupation. It was his\r\nhabit, when at home, to go over his grounds every day. I remember his\r\nreturning one morning from a walk about his plantation, delighted with\r\nthe fine specimens of corn and rice which he brought in for us to\r\nadmire. That morning--the trifling incident shows his consideration\r\nand kindness of feeling, as well as his tact and power of\r\nadaptation--seeing an article of needlework in the hands of sister\r\nA----, who was then a stranger there, he examined it, spoke of the\r\nbeauty of the coloring, the variety of the shade, and by thus showing\r\nan interest in her, at once made her at ease in his presence.\r\n\r\nHis eldest daughter always accompanied him to Washington, and in the\r\nabsence of his wife, who was often detained by family cares at Fort\r\nHill, this daughter was his solace amid arduous duties, and his\r\nconfidant in perplexing cases. Like the gifted De Stael, she loved her\r\nfather with enthusiastic devotion. Richly endowed by nature, improved\r\nby constant companionship with the great man, her mind was in harmony\r\nwith his, and he took pleasure in counselling with her. She said, \"Of\r\ncourse, I do not understand as he does, for I am comparatively a\r\nstranger to the world, yet he likes my unsophisticated opinion, and I\r\nfrankly tell him my views on any subject about which he inquires of\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nBetween himself and his younger daughter there was a peculiar and most\r\ntender union. As by the state of her health she was deprived of many\r\nenjoyments, her indulgent parents endeavored to compensate for every\r\nloss by their affection and devotion. As reading was her favorite\r\noccupation, she was allowed to go to the letter-bag when it came from\r\nthe office, and select the papers she preferred. On one occasion, she\r\nhad taken two papers, containing news of importance, which her father\r\nwas anxious to see, but he would allow no one to disturb her until she\r\nhad finished their perusal.\r\n\r\nIn his social as well as in his domestic relations he was\r\nirreproachable. No shadow rested on his pure fame, no blot on his\r\nescutcheon. In his business transactions he was punctual and\r\nscrupulously exact. He was honorable as well as honest. Young men who\r\nwere reared in his vicinity, with their eyes ever on him, say that in\r\nall respects, in small as well as in great things, his conduct was so\r\nexemplary that he might well be esteemed a model.\r\n\r\nHis profound love for his own family, his cordial interest in his\r\nfriends, his kindness and justice in every transaction, were not small\r\nvirtues in such a personage.\r\n\r\nHe was anti-Byronic. I never heard him ridicule or satirize a human\r\nbeing. Indeed, he might have been thought deficient in a sense of the\r\nludicrous, had he not by the unvarying propriety of his own conduct\r\nproved his exquisite perception of its opposites. When he differed in\r\nopinion from those with whom he conversed, he seemed to endeavor by a\r\nrespectful manner, to compensate for the disagreement. He employed\r\nreason rather than contradiction, and so earnestly would he urge an\r\nopinion and so fully present an argument, that his opponent could not\r\navoid feeling complimented rather than mortified. He paid a tribute to\r\nthe understandings of others by the force of his own reasoning, and by\r\nhis readiness to admit every argument which he could, although\r\nadvanced in opposition to one he himself had just expressed.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I declined taking a glass of wine at his table. He\r\nkindly said, \"I think you carry that a little too far. It is well to\r\ngive up every thing intoxicating, but not these light wines.\" I\r\nreplied that wine was renounced by many, for the sake of consistency,\r\nand for the benefit of those who could not afford wine. He\r\nacknowledged the correctness of the principle, adding, \"I do not know\r\nhow temperance societies can take any other ground,\" and then defined\r\nhis views of temperance, entered on a course of interesting argument,\r\nand stated facts and statistics. Of course, were all men like Mr.\r\nCalhoun temperance societies would be superfluous. Perhaps he could\r\nnot be aware of the temptations which assail many men--he was so\r\npurely intellectual, so free from self-indulgence. Materiality with\r\nhim was held subject to his higher nature. He did not even indulge\r\nhimself in a cigar. Few spent as little time and exhausted as little\r\nenergy in mere amusements. Domestic and social enjoyments were his\r\npleasures--kind and benevolent acts were his recreations.\r\n\r\nHe always seemed willing to converse on any subject which was\r\ninteresting to those about him. Returning one evening from Fort Hill,\r\nI remarked to a friend, \"I have never been more convinced of Mr.\r\nCalhoun's genius than to-day, while he talked to us of a flower.\" His\r\nversatile conversation evinced his universal knowledge, his quick\r\nperception, and his faculty of adaptation. A shower one day compelled\r\nhim to take shelter in the shed of a blacksmith, who was charmed by\r\nhis familiar conversation and the knowledge he exhibited of the\r\nmechanic arts. A naval officer was once asked, after a visit to Fort\r\nHill, how he liked Mr. Calhoun. \"Not at all,\" says he--\"I never like a\r\nman who knows more about my profession than I do myself.\" A clergyman\r\nwished to converse with him on subjects of a religious nature, and\r\nafter the interview remarked that he was astonished to find him better\r\ninformed than himself on those very points wherein he had expected to\r\ngive him information. I have understood that Mr. Calhoun avoided an\r\nexpression of opinion with regard to different sects and creeds, or\r\nwhat is called religious controversy; and once, when urged to give his\r\nviews in relation to a disputed point, he replied, \"That is a subject\r\nto which I have never given my attention.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun was unostentatious and ever averse to display. He did not\r\nappear to talk for the sake of exhibition, but from the overflowing of\r\nhis earnest nature. Whether in the Senate or in conversation with a\r\nsingle listener, his language was choice, his style fervid, his manner\r\nimpressive. Never can I forget his gentle earnestness when endeavoring\r\nto explain his views on some controverted subject, and observing that\r\nmy mind could hardly keep pace with his rapid reasoning, he would\r\noccasionally pause and say, in his kind manner, \"Do you see?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not seek to know the opinion of others with regard to himself.\r\nAnonymous letters he never read, and his daughters and nieces often\r\nsnatched from the flames letters of adulation as well as censure which\r\nhe had not read. Although he respected the opinions of his\r\nfellow-men, he did not seek office or worldly honor. A few years\r\nsince, one to whom he ever spoke freely, remarked to him that some\r\nbelieved that he was making efforts to obtain the presidency. At that\r\nmoment he had taken off his glasses, and was wiping them, and thus he\r\nreplied: \"M----, I think when a man is too old to see clearly through\r\nhis glasses, he is too old to think of the presidency.\" And recently\r\nhe said to her, \"They may impute what motives they please to me, but I\r\ndo not seek office.\" So much did he respect his country, that he might\r\nhave been gratified by the free gift of the people; so much did he\r\nlove his country, that he might have rejoiced at an opportunity to\r\nserve it, but would he have swerved one iota from his convictions to\r\nsecure a kingdom? Who that knew him believes it?\r\n\r\nIt has been said by that brilliant satirist Horace Walpole, that every\r\nman has his price. I never did believe so evil a thing; I have been\r\ntoo conversant with the great and good to believe this libel; and I\r\ndoubt not there are others beside Mr. Calhoun who value truth and\r\nhonor above all price or office.\r\n\r\nHighly as our great statesman regarded appreciation, yet he could\r\nendure to be misrepresented. While his glorious eye would light with\r\nmore brilliant lustre at the greeting of friendship or the earnest\r\nexpression of confidence, he rose superior to abuse or censure. I\r\nbelieve it was ever thus while in health. The last winter, dying in\r\nthe Senate chamber, his feeble frame could ill repel the piercing\r\nshafts of his antagonists. The ebbing currents in his pulses were\r\naccelerated. He could not desert his post, though the contest raged\r\nfiercely, but his great soul was wounded. He loved his country, he\r\nloved the Union, and it was a great grief to him in his last hours to\r\nbe misunderstood and misrepresented. Still, he was consoled by the\r\nthought that in the end he would be appreciated. Some one remarked to\r\nhim that he was a very unpopular man. He replied, \"I am, among\r\npoliticians, but not among the people, and you will know this when I\r\nam dead.\"\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Calhoun acknowledged, in his own winning way, the\r\ninvoluntary tributes of friendship and admiration, he courteously\r\ndeclined, whenever he could with propriety, public testimonies of\r\nhomage which were offered to him. His wife shared with him this\r\nunostentatious spirit, preferring the voice of friendship to the\r\nacclamations of the multitude. I have heard some of his family say\r\nthat they coveted nothing, not even the presidency, for him. They,\r\nwith many of us who knew him, felt that even the first gift of a great\r\nnation could not add one gem to his crown--that crown of genius and\r\nvirtue, whose glorious beauty no mortal power could illumine with new\r\neffulgence.\r\n\r\nHis sincerity was perfect. What he thought he said. He was no\r\ndiplomatist. Some of his theories might seem paradoxical, but a\r\nparadox is not necessarily a contradiction. He has been accused of\r\ninconsistency. Those who thus accuse him do him grievous wrong.\r\n\r\nNothing is more inconsistent than to persist in a uniform belief when\r\nchanging circumstances demand its modification. How absurd to preserve\r\na law which in the progress of society has become null and obsolete!\r\nfor instance, granting to a criminal \"the benefit of clergy.\"\r\n\"Nothing,\" says a distinguished English writer, \"is so revolutionary\r\nas to attempt to keep all things fixed, when, by the very laws of\r\nnature, all things are perpetually changing. Nothing is more arrogant\r\nthan for a fallible being to refuse to open his mind to conviction.\"\r\nWhen Mr. Calhoun altered his opinion, consistency itself required the\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nHowever some of his political sentiments might have differed from\r\nthose of many of the great and good of the age, he was sincere in\r\nthem, and believed what he asserted with all the earnestness of an\r\nenthusiastic nature, with all the faith of a close and independent\r\nthinker, and with all the confidence of one who draws his conclusions\r\nfrom general principles and not from individual facts. Time will test\r\nthe truth of his convictions. It has been said that he was sectional\r\nin his feelings, but surely his heart was large enough to embrace the\r\nwhole country. It has often been said that he wished to sever the\r\nUnion, but he loved the Union, nor could he brook the thought of\r\ndisunion if by any means unity could be preserved. Because he foresaw\r\nand frankly said that certain effects must result from certain causes,\r\ndoes this prove that he desired these effects? In his very last speech\r\nhe speaks of disunion as a \"great disaster.\" But he was not a man to\r\ncry \"peace, peace, when there was no peace.\" Although like Cassandra\r\nhe might not be believed, he would raise his warning voice; he was not\r\na man to hide himself when a hydra had sprung up which threatened to\r\ndevastate our fair and fertile land from its northern borders to its\r\nsouthern shores. And while he called on the south for union, did he\r\nnot warn the conservative party at the north that this monster was not\r\nto be tampered with? And did he not call on them to unite, and arise\r\nin their strength, and destroy it?\r\n\r\nAnd how could he, with his wise philosophy, his knowledge of human\r\nnature, and universal benevolence, view with indifference that\r\nunreflecting and wild (or should I not say _savage_) philanthropy,\r\nwhich in order to sustain abstract principles loses sight of the\r\nhappiness and welfare of every class of human beings? How often did he\r\nentreat that discussion on those subjects, beyond the right of\r\nlegislation, should be prevented, that angry words and ungenerous\r\nrecrimination should cease! Did he not foresee that such discussions\r\nwould serve to develop every element of evil in all the sections of\r\nthe country--a country with such capacities for good? Did he unwisely\r\nfear that the ancient fable of Cadmus would be realized--that\r\ndragon-teeth, recklessly scattered, would spring up armed? And did he\r\nnot know that the southern heart could not remain insensible to\r\nreproach and aggression?\r\n\r\n    \"Non obtusa adeo gestamus pectora Poeni:\r\n    Nec tam aversus equos Tyria Sol jungit, ab urbe.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, ah, how earnestly did he plead for peace, and truth, and justice!\r\nAs far as I understood him, he wished to benefit by his policy in\r\naffairs both the south and the north. I remember, in speaking to me of\r\nfree trade, he expressed the opinion that the course he recommended\r\nwould benefit the north as well as the south. This he did not merely\r\nassert, but sustained with frequent argument. In his conversation\r\nthere was a remarkable blending of fact and theory, of a knowledge of\r\nthe past and an insight into the future.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun was a philanthropist in the most liberal sense of the\r\nword. He desired for man the utmost happiness, the greatest good, and\r\nthe highest elevation. If he differed from lovers of the race in other\r\nparts of the world, with regard to the means of obtaining these\r\nresults, it was not because he failed to study the subject; not\r\nbecause he lacked opportunities of observation and of obtaining facts;\r\nnor because he indulged in selfish prejudices. From every quarter he\r\ngleaned accessible information, and with conscientious earnestness he\r\nbrought his wonderful powers of generalization to bear on the subject\r\nof human happiness and advancement--his pure unselfish heart aiding\r\nhis powerful mind.\r\n\r\nThe good of the least of God's creatures was not beneath his regard;\r\nbut he did not believe that the least was equal to the greatest; he\r\ndid not think the happiness or elevation of any class could be secured\r\nby a sentiment so unphilosophical. The attempt to reduce all to a\r\nlevel, to put all minds in uniform, to give all the same employment,\r\nhe viewed as chimerical. He said that in every civilized society there\r\nmust be division of labor, and he believed the slaves at the south\r\nmore happy, more free from suffering and crime, than any corresponding\r\nclass in any country. He had no aristocratic pride, but he desired for\r\nhimself and others the highest possible elevation. He respected the\r\nartisan, the mechanic, and agriculturist, and considered each of these\r\noccupations as affording scope for native talent. He believed the\r\nAfrican to be most happy and useful under the guidance of an\r\nAnglo-Saxon; he is averse to hard labor and responsible effort; he\r\nlikes personal service, and identifies himself with those he serves.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun spoke of the great inconsistency of English denunciations\r\nof American slavery, and said that to every man, woman, and child in\r\nEngland, two hundred and fifty persons were tributary. Although\r\ncolonial possessions and individual possessions are by many regarded\r\nas different, he considered them involved in the same general\r\nprinciple. In considering the rights of man the great question is not,\r\nHas a master a right to hold a slave? but, Has one human being a right\r\nto hold another subordinate? The rights of man may be invaded, and the\r\nidol Liberty cast down, by those who are loudest in their\r\nphilanthropic denunciations respecting slavery. Is there as much\r\ncruelty in holding slaves, even under the most unfavorable\r\ncircumstances, as in selling into bondage a whole nation?[4] Let the\r\nbrave chiefs of the Rohillas answer from the battle-field. Let cries\r\nreply from the burning cities of Rohilcund. Let the princesses of Oude\r\nspeak from their prisons.\r\n\r\nClose observation, prompted by a kindly heart, had brought Mr. Calhoun\r\nto the opinion that the Africans in this country were happier in\r\nexisting circumstances than they would be in any other; that they were\r\nimproving in their condition, and that any attempt to change it, at\r\nleast at present, would not only be an evil to the country but fraught\r\nwith suffering to them. A state of freedom, so called, would be to\r\nthem a state of care and disaster. To abolish slavery now would be to\r\nabolish the slave. The race would share the doom of the Indians.\r\nAlthough here nominally slaves, as a general thing they enjoy more\r\nfreedom than any where else; for is not that freedom, where one is\r\nhappiest and best, and where there is a correspondence between the\r\nsituation and the desires, the condition and the capacities? May we\r\nnot say with the angel Abdiel:\r\n\r\n    \"Unjustly thou depravest it with the name\r\n    Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,\r\n    Or Nature. God and Nature bid the same,\r\n    When he who rules is worthiest, and excels\r\n    Them whom he governs. This is servitude,\r\n    To serve the unwise.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun found the local attachment of the slaves so strong, their\r\nrelation to their owners so satisfying to their natures, and the\r\nsouthern climate so congenial to them, that he did not believe any\r\nchange of place or state would benefit them.\r\n\r\nThese, as nearly as I can recollect, were his opinions on the subject\r\nof slavery, and were expressed to me in several conversations.\r\nSentiments similar to these are entertained by many high-minded and\r\nbenevolent slave-holders. That this institution, like every other, is\r\nliable to abuse, is admitted, but every planter must answer, not for\r\nthe institution--for which he is no more accountable than for the fall\r\nof Adam--but for his individual discharge of duty. If, through his\r\nselfishness, or indolence, or false indulgence, or severity, his\r\nservants suffer, then to his Master in heaven he must give account.\r\nBut those who obey the divine mandate, \"Give unto your servants that\r\nwhich is just and equal,\" need not fear. In the endeavor to perform\r\ntheir duty in the responsible sphere in which they were placed by no\r\nact of their own, they can repose even in the midst of the wild storm\r\nwhich threatens devastation to our fertile land; they can look away\r\nfrom the judgment of the world, nor will they, even if all the powers\r\nof earth bid them, adopt a policy which will ruin themselves, their\r\nchildren, and the dependent race in their midst; they will not cast a\r\npeople they are bound to protect on the tender mercies of the cruel.\r\nIn their conservative measures they are, and must be, supported at the\r\nnorth, by men of liberal and philosophical minds, of extended views,\r\nand benevolent hearts. But I have said far more on this subject than I\r\nintended, and will add only that those who do not, from personal\r\nobservation, know this institution in its best estate, cannot easily\r\nunderstand the softened features it often wears, nor the high virtues\r\nexhibited by the master, and the confiding, dependent attachment of\r\nthe servant. Often is the southern planter as a patriarch in olden\r\ntimes. Those who are striving to sever his household know not what\r\nthey do.\r\n\r\nWell may we who live in these troubled times exclaim with Madame\r\nRoland, the martyr of the false principles of her murderers, \"O\r\nLiberte! O Liberte! que de crimes on commet en ton nom!\" This she\r\nsaid, turning to the statue of liberty beside the scaffold. Liberty\r\nunrestrained degenerates into license. There may be political freedom\r\nwithout social liberty. Says Lamartine, speaking of the inhabitants of\r\nMalta, \"Ils sont esclaves de la loi immuable de la force que Dieu leur\r\nfait; nous sommes esclaves des lois variables et capricieuses que nous\r\nnous faisons.\"\r\n\r\nA few years' residence on this soil might teach even a Wilberforce to\r\nturn in his philanthropy to other and wider fields of action.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Calhoun's character as a master much might be said, for all who\r\nknew him admit that it was exemplary. But we need not multiply\r\nexamples to prove his unaffected goodness, and I will repeat only a\r\ncircumstance or two, which, by way of illustrating some subjects\r\ndiscussed, he incidentally mentioned to me. One related to a free\r\nnegro, formerly a slave in Carolina, but then living in one of our\r\nnorthern cities, who came to him in Washington, begging him to\r\nintercede for his return to Carolina. He represented his condition as\r\ndeplorable, said that he could not support himself and family by his\r\ntrade, (he was a shoemaker,) and that not being able to obtain\r\nsufficient food or fuel in that cold climate, they were almost frozen.\r\n\"When I told him,\" said Mr. Calhoun, \"that I would do all I could for\r\nhim, he seized both my hands in his and expressed fervent gratitude.\"\r\nAt another time, speaking of a family whom his son designed to take to\r\nAlabama, he told me that the mother of the family came to him and said\r\nshe would prefer to stay with her master and mistress on the\r\nplantation, even if all her children went with master A. Mr. Calhoun\r\nadded, \"I could not think of her remaining without either of her\r\nchildren; and as she chose to stay, we retained her youngest son, a\r\nboy of twelve years.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun required very little of any one, doing more for others\r\nthan he asked of them. He seemed to act upon the principle that the\r\nstrong should bear the burthens of the weak. In sickness he feared to\r\ngive trouble, and unless his friends insisted, would have little done\r\nfor him. \"Energetic as he was,\" said a near relative, \"he would lie\r\npatiently all day, asking for nothing.\" His sensibility was of the\r\nmost unselfish nature. Some months before his death, and after he left\r\nFort Hill the last time, he said he felt that death was near, much\r\nnearer than he was willing to have his family know, and added that he\r\nwished to give all the time he could spare from public duty to\r\npreparation for death. While suffering from increasing illness at\r\nWashington, still, as he hoped to return again to his family, he was\r\nunwilling, though they anxiously awaited his summons, that they should\r\nbe alarmed, saying he could not bear to see their grief. No doubt his\r\nconscientious spirit felt that his country at that critical moment\r\ndemanded his best energies, and that he should be unnerved by the\r\npresence of his nearest friends; and loving his own family as he did,\r\nand so beloved as he was by them, he serenely awaited the approach of\r\nthe king of Terrors, and suffered his last sorrow far from his home,\r\ncheered only by one watcher from his household.\r\n\r\nThere was a beautiful adaptation in his bearing--a just appreciation\r\nof what was due to others, and a nice sense of propriety. I have had\r\nopportunities to compare his manners with those of other great men.\r\nHis kind and unaffected interest was expressed in a way peculiarly\r\ndignified and refined. Some men appear to think they atone for a low\r\nestimate of our sex by flattery. Not so with Mr. Calhoun. He paid the\r\nhighest compliment which could be paid to woman, by recognizing in her\r\na soul--a soul capable of understanding and appreciating. Of his\r\ndesire for her improvement and elevation he gave substantial proofs.\r\nAlthough Fort Hill was five miles from the female academy he never\r\nsuffered an examination to pass without honoring it with his presence.\r\nHe came not for the sake of form, but he exhibited an interest in the\r\nexercises, and was heard to comment upon them afterwards in a manner\r\nwhich showed that he had given them attention. He never reminded you\r\nthat his hours were more precious than yours. The question may be\r\nasked how could he, amid his great and stern duties, find time for\r\nattention to those things from which so many men excuse themselves on\r\nthe plea of business. But he wasted no time, and by gathering up its\r\nfragments, he had enough and to spare. I have before said that his\r\nkind acts were his recreations.\r\n\r\nWere I asked wherein lay the charm which won the hearts of all who\r\ncame within his circle, I could not at once reply. It was perhaps his\r\nperfect _abandon_, his sincerity, his confidential manner, his\r\nchildlike simplicity, in union with his majestic intelligence, and his\r\nself-renunciation--the crowning virtue of his life: these imparted the\r\nvivid enjoyment and the delightful repose which his friends felt in\r\nhis presence. It was often not so much what he said as his manner of\r\nsaying it, that was so impressive. Never can I forget an incident\r\nwhich occurred at the time when a war with England, on account of\r\nOregon, seemed impending. He arrived in Charleston during the\r\nexcitement on that subject. He was asked in the drawing-room if he\r\nthought there would be a war. He waived an answer, saying that for\r\nsome time he had been absent from home and had received no official\r\ndocuments; but as he passed with us from the drawing-room to the\r\nstreet door, he said to me in his rapid, earnest manner, \"I anticipate\r\na severe seven months' campaign. I have never known our country in\r\nsuch a state.\" War has a terror for me, and I said, \"Oh, Mr. Calhoun,\r\ndo not let a war arise. Do all you can to prevent it.\" He replied, \"I\r\nwill do all, in honor, I can do,\" and paused. A thousand thoughts\r\nseemed to pass over his face, his soul was in his eyes, and bending a\r\nlittle forward, as if bowed by a sense of his responsibility and\r\ninsufficiency, he added, speaking slowly and with emphasis and with\r\nthe deepest solemnity, as if questioning with himself, \"_But what can\r\none man do?_\" I see him now. No painting or sculpture could remind me\r\nso truly of him as does my faithful memory. But I will not dwell on\r\nthe subject, for I fear I can never by words convey to the mind of\r\nanother the impression which I received of his sincerity, and of his\r\ndevotion to his country and to the cause of humanity. How he redeemed\r\nhis pledge to do all that he, in honor, could do, his efforts in the\r\nsettlement of the Oregon question truly show. When next I saw him I\r\ntold him how much I was delighted with his Oregon speech. In his\r\nkindest manner he replied, \"I am glad I can say any thing to please\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Mr. Calhoun, you, my brother, were with me. You\r\nremember that his kind wife took us to his room, and that you remarked\r\nthe cheerfulness and affability with which he received us, although\r\nhis feeble health had obliged him to refuse almost every one that day.\r\nWe shall see him no more, but his memory will linger with us.\r\n\r\nTo you I would commend him as an example. Read his letter to a young\r\nlaw-student. As you are so soon to enter the profession of law, such a\r\nmodel as Mr. Calhoun may be studied with advantage. While I would\r\nnever wish any one to lose his own individuality, or to descend to\r\nimitation, I believe that one gifted mind leaves its impress on\r\nanother; while I would not deify or canonize a mortal, I would render\r\nhomage to one who united such moral attainments to so rare a\r\ncombination of intellectual gifts; while it is degrading to ourselves\r\nand injurious to others to lavish unmerited and extravagant praise, it\r\nis a loss not to appreciate a character like his, for it ennobles our\r\nown nature to contemplate the true and the beautiful.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is said that our country is in danger from its ideas of\r\nequality, and its want of reverence and esteem for age, and wisdom,\r\nand office, and talents, and attainments, and virtues--and this\r\nfeature of the American character is so strongly impressed that Mar\r\nYohannah, the Nestorian bishop, said in my presence, in his peculiar\r\nEnglish, \"Yes, I know this nation glory in its republicanism, but I am\r\nafraid it will become republican to God\"--yet it is a cheering omen\r\nwhen a man like Mr. Calhoun is so beloved and reverenced. I think\r\nevery one who was favored with a personal acquaintance with him will\r\nadmit that I have not been guilty of exaggeration, and \"will delight\r\nto do him honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, to what are we to ascribe the formation\r\nof such a character? There must have been causes for such effects.\r\nWhence came his temperance, his self-denial, his incorruptible\r\nintegrity, his fidelity in every duty, his love for mankind, his\r\nindefatigable efforts for the good of others, and his superiority to\r\nthose things which the natural heart most craves? Mr. Calhoun's\r\nchildhood was spent among the glorious works of nature, and was\r\nsheltered from the temptations which abound in promiscuous society. He\r\nwas the son of pious parents, and by them he was taught the Bible, and\r\nfrom that source undoubtedly his native gifts were perfected. I have\r\nunderstood that from early life he was an advocate for the doctrines\r\nof the Bible, as understood by orthodox Christians. I have been told\r\nby relatives of his who were on the most intimate terms with him, that\r\nfor some time before his death his mind had seemed to be much occupied\r\nwith religious subjects, and that he too often expressed confidence in\r\nthe providence of God to leave any doubt as to his trust in Him. An\r\neminent clergyman, now deceased, said in conversation with another,\r\nthat he had often conversed with Mr. Calhoun on the subject of\r\nreligion, and had no doubt as to his piety. I have remarked his\r\nreverential air in church, and have known him apparently much\r\ndisturbed by any inattention in others. He never united with any\r\nchurch, and it is my opinion, formed not without some reason, that he\r\nwas prevented, not by disregard to any Christian ordinances, but from\r\npersonal and conscientious scruples with respect to his\r\nqualifications. He was a man who weighed every thing with mathematical\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nAlthough open as day on topics of general interest, he was reserved in\r\nrespect to himself. I do not recollect ever to have heard him speak\r\negotistically, for his mind seemed always engrossed by some great\r\nthought, and he appears, even at the close of life, to lose all\r\npersonal solicitudes in his anxiety for his country. In one of his\r\nlast letters he says, \"But I must close. This may be my last\r\ncommunication to you. My end is probably near, perhaps very near.\r\nBefore I reach it, I have but one serious wish to gratify--it is to\r\nsee my country quieted under some arrangement (alas, I know not what!)\r\nthat will be satisfactory to all and safe to the south.\" His country's\r\npeace, and quietness, and safety, he did not see; he perished in the\r\nstorm; and there are many who knew and loved him who cherish the hope\r\nthat he is removed to a higher sphere of action--that his noble spirit\r\nhas meekly entered into the presence of its author, and that in the\r\nstarry courts above he will receive an inheritance \"incorruptible,\r\nundefiled, and that fadeth not away.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the elaborate preparations which were made here in\r\nCharleston for his funeral, knowing his simple tastes and habits, and\r\nhis benevolence, I was at first pained, and I thought he would not\r\nhave sanctioned so much display. I feared too that solemnity would be\r\nlost in pageantry. But it was not so. There was nothing to jar upon\r\nthe feelings of the most sensitive. All was in perfect and mournful\r\nharmony. Silently and reverently his sorrowing countrymen bore his\r\nremains from the steamer where they had reposed, under a canopy\r\nwearing its thirty stars, and when the hearse, so funereal with\r\nmournful drapery and sable plumes, entered the grounds of the citadel,\r\ndeep silence brooded over the vast multitude; noiselessly were heads\r\nuncovered, banners dropped--not a sound but that of the tramp of\r\nhorses was heard; statue-like was that phalanx, with every eye\r\nuplifted, to the sacred sarcophagus. If there was too much of show, it\r\nwas redeemed by the spirit that prompted it: the symbols, significant\r\nand expressive, as they were, faintly shadowed forth the deep and\r\nuniversal grief; the mournful pageantry, the tolling bell, the muffled\r\ndrum, the closed and shrouded stores and houses, gave external signs\r\nof wo, but more impressive and affecting was the peaceful sadness\r\nwhich brooded over the metropolis while it awaited the relics of the\r\npatriot, and the deep silence which pervaded the vast procession that\r\nfollowed to the City Hall, the subdued bearing of the crowd who\r\nresorted thither, and the solemnity expressed on every face--for these\r\ntold that the great heart of the city and commonwealth wept in hushed\r\nand sincere sorrow over \"the mighty fallen in the midst of the\r\nbattle.\"\r\n\r\nOne day and night the illustrious dead reposed in state in the draped\r\nand darkened Hall. An entrance was formed by the arching palmetto,\r\nthat classic tree, under whose branches Dudon the crusader was placed,\r\nwhen slain in Palestine. On that tree--\"altissima palma\"--his comrades\r\nplaced his trophies. With a spirit as sad as that of the crusaders\r\nwhen under the verdant foliage of the palm they mourned the noble\r\nDudon, did those who loved our champion pass beneath that arch, dark\r\nwith funereal gloom. The sarcophagus was within a magnificent\r\ncatafalque; the canopy rested on Corinthian columns; the bier was\r\napparently supported by six urns, while three pearl-colored eagles\r\nsurmounted the canopy, holding in their beaks the swinging crape.\r\nInvisible lamps cast moonlight beams over the radiated upper surface\r\nof the canopy. Through the day numbers resorted to this hallowed spot,\r\nand at night vigils were held where the dead reposed. When morning\r\ncame the chosen guards carried the remains of the great leader to the\r\nchurch. The funeral car was not allowed to bear these sacred remains\r\nto the tomb, but they were borne by sons of the state, with uncovered\r\nheads. Well might those who saw all these things feel that Carolina\r\nwould never be wanting to herself. The body was placed upon the bier,\r\nsurrounded by significant offerings, pure flowers and laurel-wreaths.\r\nA velvet pall, revealing in silver lines the arms of the state, the\r\npalmetto, covered the sarcophagus. Above it was a coronet woven of\r\nlaurel-leaves, like that which crowned Tasso. Then, in that church,\r\nwhere columns, arches, and galleries were shrouded in the drapery of\r\nwo, the funeral rites were performed--the mighty dead was placed in\r\nhis narrow tomb.\r\n\r\nPeerless statesman, illustrious counsellor, devoted patriot, generous\r\nfriend, indulgent husband and father, thy humble, noble heart is still\r\nin death; thy life was yielded up at the post of duty; thou hast\r\nperished like a sentinel on guard, a watchman in his tower. \"Thou wast\r\nslain in thy high places.\" Clouds gathered thick and fast about thy\r\ncountry's horizon, and even thy eagle eye failed in its mournful gaze\r\nto penetrate the gloom which hides its future from mortal eye. Thy\r\nwork is finished--peacefully rest with thine own! Thy memory is\r\nenshrined in the hearts of those for whom thy heart ceased its\r\nbeating. Thy grave is with us--\r\n\r\n    \"Yet spirit immortal, the tomb cannot bind thee,\r\n      For like thine own eagle that soared to the sun,\r\n    Thou springest from bondage, and leavest behind thee\r\n      A name which before thee few mortals have won.\"\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the character of Mr. Calhoun, we find a rare combination\r\nof mental and moral qualities--a union of contrasts. He had genius\r\nwith common sense, the power of generalization with the habit of\r\nabstraction, rapidity of thought with application and industry. His\r\nmind was suggestive and logical, imaginative and practical. His noble\r\nideal was embodied in his daily life. He was at once discursive and\r\nprofound; he could soar like the eagle, or hover on unwearied wings\r\naround a minute circle. He meekly bore his lofty endowments; his\r\nchildlike simplicity imparted a charm to his transcendent intellect;\r\nhe united dignity with humility, sincerity with courtesy, decision\r\nwith gentleness, stern inflexibility with winning urbanity, and keen\r\nsensibility with perfect self-command. He was indulgent to others,\r\ndenying to himself; he was energetic in health, and patient in\r\nsickness; he combined strict temperance with social habits; he was\r\nreserved in communicating his personal feelings, but his heart was\r\nopen on subjects of general interest; he prized the regard of his\r\nfellow-beings, but was superior to worldly pomps and flatteries; he\r\nhonored his peers, but was not swayed by their opinions. Equal to the\r\ngreatest, he did not despise the least of men. He did not neglect one\r\nduty to perform another. In the Senate he was altogether a senator, in\r\nprivate and domestic life he was as though he had never entered the\r\nhalls of the nation, and had never borne an illustrious part in the\r\ncouncils of his country.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _Vide_ Macaulay's article on Warren Hastings, in the Edinburgh Review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTYLES OF PHILOSOPHIES.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY REV. J. R. MORELL,\r\n\r\nTranslator of Fourier \"On the Passions,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of literatures, like that of nations, has presented its\r\nvarieties as well as its curiosities, and both alike furnish similar\r\nthough not identical features.\r\n\r\n1st. Families and clans are traceable equally in each development, and\r\nthe movements both of literatures and races have displayed a\r\ncorresponding monotony and eccentricity, convergence and divergence,\r\nin proportion as they have progressed along the beaten track of\r\nopinion or performed outpost duty as the corps of guides.\r\n\r\n2d. Not only is this family likeness obvious in the general\r\ncharacteristics of ethnography and authorship, but the laws of lineage\r\nand the hereditary transmission of qualities are as strongly marked in\r\none case as in the other. Letters as well as races have their\r\nhereditary sceptres and coronets; but whereas, in the latter case the\r\nfleshly heir of the great of other days may chance to be unworthy of\r\nhis sires, the spiritual sonship of the patrician writer is\r\nstereotyped upon each line and lineament of his nature.\r\n\r\n3d. Nor is the connection between words and peoples confined to a law\r\nof analogy running through them both, but they have reacted upon and\r\nmoulded each other in a manner curious to relate, and races and\r\nletters have mutually made and unmade each other.\r\n\r\n4th. The Indo-Germanic people have left monuments of their sinewy\r\nenergy in the psycho-physical characteristics of affiliated races and\r\ntongues, and individual family likenesses may be readily traced\r\nbetween groups of thinkers and dreamers on the banks of the Ganges, in\r\nthe Academy, and at Weimar. Again the mystical semitic world, groaning\r\nbeneath the weight of an overwrought ideal, and lacking the ballast of\r\nscience and patient thought, has ever and anon given birth to\r\nprodigies and monsters of cabalistic or Gnostic extravagance.\r\n\r\n5th. To follow the currents of peoples and tongues, the great\r\nsubdivisions of the Teutonic and Romance tribes and literatures, their\r\nvirtues and vices have stamped its present physical and moral\r\ncharacter on the face of modern Europe. The Teutonic, representing\r\nstrength and depth in word and work, has been the stronghold of\r\nemancipation in life and thought, yet tinctured with the savageness\r\nand chaos of unpolished and disordered nature. The Romance, fettered\r\nby the rhythm of Latinity, has yet possessed that voluptuous wealth of\r\nthe ideal and that graceful tracery of thought and wit which have been\r\ndenied to the other. The antagonism of the Catholic and Protestant\r\nmind is the result of this contrast, which has, moreover, been\r\npictured in the tertian fevers of French revolution and in the\r\nmystical skepticism of modern Germany.\r\n\r\nAs certain races, so also certain families of writers, have in thought\r\ntranscended the bounds of the existing and actual, and thrown out from\r\ntheir brain an ideal past, present, or future, beyond the horizon, and\r\nfree from the flaws of their experience. Thus, whilst the followers of\r\nTao-tse were in China seeking for the drug of immortality, the Greek\r\nand Roman poets and historians were dreaming of a golden age that cast\r\nits radiance over the past, or of that fabled Atlantis and those sweet\r\nIslands of the Blest in the far west--dreams and fables that have been\r\nsomewhat justified by modern discovery. Again sacred voices mingled\r\nwith these aspirations, and the semitic bards and seers pronounced in\r\ntheir oracles an Eden for the past and a millenium for the future of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nNor were these views confined to the old world, for the followers of\r\nColumbus found, among the cannibals of the gulf, the traditions of a\r\nfountain of eternal youth, and later travellers were regaled with\r\ngorgeous stories of El Dorado and his empire--traditions and stories\r\nthat seemed to point, however obscurely, to the Sitzbath and\r\nCalifornian riches.\r\n\r\nThere has likewise been a class of writers broad-cast through the\r\nnations who have sought to mend the present and make the future by\r\nholding the mirror to contemporaneous deformity, or painting the\r\nperspective of an earthly elysium with the rainbow tints of hope.\r\nNegatively or positively, directly or indirectly, these men had, in\r\ncommon, faith in the regeneration of humanity. Utopias are the\r\nfamiliar homes of such minds, either because they have a cast in their\r\neyes, or because they are more clairvoyants than the vulgar herd. In\r\nthe spring-time of our race, a Plato reflected on the poetical\r\nextravagancies of his day, and refracted the rays of golden fancy in\r\nthe enchanted land of his Republic. The Hebrew seers in like manner,\r\nwhilst they apply no measured castigations to the money-changers who\r\nconverted the temple of God into a den of thieves, love to soar in\r\nsublimest rhapsody above the valley of dry bones and the shadow of\r\ndeath cast around them, and to indulge in visions of a vernal future,\r\nwhen earth should smile in the sunshine of infinite love, when the\r\nwolf should dwell with the lamb and the leopard lie down with the kid,\r\nand a little child should lead them. Affiliated members of this\r\nextensive and venerable company of cynics and seers have ever and anon\r\nin the current of ages lifted a frowning brow above the troubled\r\nwaters round about them, and with the same breath that swept like a\r\ntempest over the wintry waste, their cradle and their home, have given\r\nutterance to strains of harmony that told of summer skies to come.\r\nTracing the tides of the children of men in their eccentric ebbings\r\nand floodings, a little crew of rovers may be ever seen ploughing the\r\nworld of waters, true to their principle of keeping aloof from the\r\ngulf-stream. Europe has been the chief nursery of these rovers, whose\r\nvoices, though few and far between, have risen above the storms of\r\nevil passions howling about them, and have echoed through the ages.\r\nThus a Rabelais could laugh the knell of monkery, and with his stentor\r\nvoice, rich booming from the classic world of Nature, that had slept\r\nduring the dark ages, could crack the babel of spiritual usurpation,\r\nand restore the balance of power between the seen and the unseen. A\r\nCervantes in like manner could, in the fulness of time, inflict\r\ndeath-wounds with a stroke of his pen on a superannuated chivalry, and\r\nthus, by negatively giving a _coup de grace_ to the past, pave the way\r\nfor an age of prose. Later in the day a Swift appears, in the heart of\r\na rotten age, himself infected with the leprosy, yet he smites the\r\nidols of his time, of Stuart progeny, Lust and Lucre, and converts his\r\nfables into a house of correction for a nation's vices. The Tale of a\r\nTub contains a stream of lustral water, and Gulliver is no mean adept\r\nat the photographic art. The Dean hath taught us how the \"positive\"\r\nfictions of a madman's brain may indirectly be a school to the nations\r\nat all times and in all seasons.\r\n\r\nPoesy has mixed its plaintive strains in the lamentations and oracles\r\nof insane or inspired reformers, and the aberration or illumination of\r\na kindred spirit breaks forth in the wizard words of a prophet or a\r\nbard. Some favored scions of the royal priesthood and chosen\r\ngeneration of whom we speak seem to mingle these various and\r\nheterogeneous ingredients, the cynic's lash with the seer's lamp,\r\nmathematical squares and compasses with the conjurations of the\r\ndiviner. Their proportions, both harmonious and deformed, bespeak\r\ntheir consanguinity with an extensive family, whose branches are\r\nscattered through broad lands, and are not confined to a single\r\nvariety of the human race, though the quality and quantity of their\r\n_esprit de corps_ may be especially predicated of the Caucasian race.\r\n\r\nThere are sovereign natures that bespeak the choice blood of rival and\r\nremote races mingling in their veins, and which may claim kinsmanship\r\nin opposite and conflicting clans of teachers. We have Indo-Germanic\r\nminds, whose massive substance is relieved by the arabesque of the\r\nSemitic style of thought, and which, though stamped with the\r\ncharacteristic mould of their parentage, fling aside much of its\r\nspeciality, and stand forth as magnates in the universal aristocracy\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\nAn example of a rich nature cast in this mould has been presented of\r\nlate years in France, in the person of Charles Fourier. Though\r\nindelibly French, he is still more human, and though Teutonic elements\r\nenter largely as component parts of his frame, and the Romance genius\r\nhas cast its sunshine tints over his canvas, yet has he bravely shaken\r\noff the chains of generic and specific modes of thought and sight, and\r\nthe priestly hieroglyphs and geometry of Egypt are seen to blend with\r\nPersian dualism and the prophetic wand of Hebrew seers in his pages.\r\nNay, the mantle of Mohammed might seem to have fallen on his capacious\r\nshoulders, to judge from the strangely glorious flights of his fancy,\r\nand the tangible solids of his elysium. Thus the nations would appear\r\nto have converged towards and centred in this brain, and to have\r\ndropped in their pearls or their paste, as the case might be.\r\nExaggerating the mathematical precision of French thought, it is yet\r\ntempered in a manner somewhat uncommon, by the most wholesale\r\npicture-writing on which man ever yet ventured. The flaming\r\ndouble-edged critic's sword is sometimes changed in his hands, after a\r\nmanner wonderful to relate, into an Esculapian staff, which farther\r\nsuffers a frequent conversion into Mercurian caduceus and Bacchanile\r\nThyrsus, and at another time assumes the proportions of Midas's wand.\r\nNever was such a many-faced Janus seen in the flesh as this man, who\r\nexceeds Proteus and Hindoo avatars in multiplicity combined with\r\nunity.\r\n\r\nThe bitter laugh still curls our lips, elicited by his merciless\r\nsatire, when the tears of pity come coursing down our cheeks, as he\r\ntouches with magic finger the most godlike fibres of the soul.\r\nLuxuriance, bordering on levity, follows fast a sense of justice and\r\nof truth, that might have put a Brutus and an Aristides to the blush.\r\nNational contrasts, harmonies, and deformities, all seem reflected in\r\nthis representative man.\r\n\r\nYet it would be a very partial view that represented Fourier as\r\nnothing better than an expletive particle added to the genealogical\r\nlist of idea-mongers, or a mosaic of valuable relics in earth's\r\ncabinet of curiosities. Though his pen inflicts wounds both broad and\r\ndeep, yet a balm is ever at hand. Not satisfied with performing\r\namputations for the good of the body corporate, he is a professor of\r\nthe healing art, and affects to have discovered an elixir that shall\r\nwipe away all tears, by causing pain and sorrow to flee away. I do not\r\nprofess to judge of the merits of the case, but one feature\r\ndistinguishes Fourier from critics, reformers, and prophets, who are\r\ngathered to their fathers. He is a _scientific_ explorer, and the\r\nplans that he has designed for the future structure of humanity, from\r\nthe high order of architecture and mechanics which they exhibit,\r\ndiscriminate him from the vulgar herd as an originator, and place him\r\nin the category either of eminent scientific adventurers or inventors.\r\nDaring and caution shake hands at every page, and seem exhausted by\r\nhis pen. The Archimedian lever found a resting-place in his brain, and\r\nsundry of his thoughts seem not inapt to upheave the world.\r\n\r\nIf Laplace deserves credit as the creator of a Mechanique Celeste,\r\nFourier has equal claims to gratitude as the first and only propounder\r\nof a rigidly scientific system of mental mechanics. Though Pythagoras\r\nmight smile complacently at his harmonies and sacred numbers, and\r\nPlato clap his hands on seeing so worthy a disciple of his Republic,\r\nyet the fiery Frenchman is but too apt to run counter to the past, and\r\ngive a slap in the face to the wisdom of the fore-world. Though hope\r\nand faith ever brighten his pages, we could wish at times for a larger\r\ninfusion of charity, to neutralize the gall in which his pen was\r\ndipped. Yet he nobly vindicates his claim as a reformer by the lash he\r\napplies with no measured hand to injustice, falseness, and hypocrisy,\r\nunder whatever guise they may appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF PARIS, FROM 1817 TO 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the original publication of this work, in German, at Berlin, we\r\ngave in the _International_ some account of it; and we avail ourselves\r\nof the notice in the _Athenaeum_ of an English translation of it which\r\nhas just appeared in London, to give some of its best passages. In the\r\ncapital of a nation which, above all others, has been wont to project\r\nits gravest interests into the circles of fashion and gayety, the\r\nperiod included between 1817 and 1848 must have been rich indeed in\r\nmatter for observation of all kinds, by the foreigner admitted to its\r\nsaloons. With Waterloo at one end of the line, and the overthrow of\r\nLouis Philippe at the other, what a world of change lies\r\nbetween!--what unexpected turns of fortune, each throwing some new\r\ntint on the chameleon-play of social existence! We may not expect a\r\nlady's eye to see more than its outward features. But these alone, in\r\nsuch a scene and period, are themselves enough to give some permanent\r\nhistorical value, as well as a present attraction to the survey, if\r\nonly taken with common feminine intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the retrospect is not actually so rich as the above\r\ndates would imply.--Connected notices of what might be seen in\r\nParisian circles do not extend beyond the first seven years of the\r\nperiod in question. Afterwards, there is nearly a total hiatus, except\r\nin the two departments of music and painting--anecdotes of which are\r\ncontinued almost to the close of the Orleans dynasty. Of the persons\r\nand events which otherwise filled the scene from 1828 downwards, the\r\n_Reminiscences_ are wholly silent, or only introduce one or two\r\nfigures by anticipation while dwelling on the period of the\r\nRestoration. The volume ends, indeed, with a story, in which some of\r\nthe very latest exhibitions of somnambulism serve to introduce a\r\nSpanish romance, founded, it may be, on a basis of fact, but evidently\r\ndressed up for effect by one not well enough acquainted with the Spain\r\nof this century to give to the composition a probable air. But here\r\nthe display in the Parisian saloon is merely an occasional overture to\r\nthe melo-drama that follows; and we learn next to nothing of the new\r\nfaces and new fashions which the writer may have seen during the\r\nsecond half of the term included in her title. What is now published,\r\ntherefore, can only be taken as a fragment--destined, perhaps, to be\r\nfurther completed at some future time.\r\n\r\nThe work appears anonymously; and it might be uncourteous to pry into\r\nthe condition of the writer, beyond what it has pleased herself to\r\nreveal. This is to the effect that she came to Paris, unmarried, and\r\nhardly out of her teens, from some part of Germany, in the second year\r\nof the Restoration, and, at first, was chiefly conversant with the\r\ncircles of the _haute finance_. We afterwards hear of her marriage, of\r\njourneyings and absences, and see her in contact with various circles,\r\nbut, above all, with painters and musicians; intimate also with\r\nHenriette, the daughter of the celebrated Jewish philosopher,\r\nMendelssohn. She left Paris, she further says, before the explosion of\r\n1848. More of her personal history she does not tell--and we shall not\r\ntake the liberty of guessing.\r\n\r\nHer notes are penned without any attempt at order; and make no\r\npretence to dive far beneath the surface of what she saw in the world.\r\nThey contain such light, lady-like reflections as one may fancy taken\r\ndown without effort from the kaleidoscope of Paris life, in its balls,\r\n_soirees_, and promenades; and such anecdotes of notable things and\r\npersons as were current in ordinary company--many of which are well\r\nknown, having been already reported by others. Here and there a\r\ngraphic trait, or a remark above the level of commonplace, gives token\r\nof more lively intelligence, but the general character of the\r\nreminiscence is merely gossipping--just on the ordinary level of such\r\nobservations and ideas as prevail in the common talk of the saloons.\r\nIt is only when she touches on the fine arts, especially on music,\r\nthat the lady displays decidedly clever notions of her own. Gleanings\r\nof this easy kind, from any lesser field than Paris, might hardly have\r\nbeen worth preserving; here, the abundance of matter is so great, that\r\neven the most careless hand returns from that strange harvest with\r\nsome gatherings of value.\r\n\r\nAmong these we shall dip here and there, without attempting more order\r\nin selection than the author herself has observed in arranging her\r\nnotes. Each may be read by and for itself without any disadvantage\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nIn no respect, perhaps, does the Paris of to-day differ more from that\r\nof thirty years since than in the article of domestic comfort. After\r\npraising Madame Thuret, one of the financial _lionnes_ of the\r\nRestoration, for her attention to neatness, the lady adds:--\r\n\r\n     In Paris generally there was a marked contrast to this; as\r\n     well as to the Parisian cleanliness of present times. In\r\n     those days, even the dwellings of people of competent means,\r\n     there was not a trace of comfort. I have a lively\r\n     recollection of what happened when one of the younger\r\n     partners of M. Thuret gave a ball soon after his marriage.\r\n     Although the youth was rich, and had married a wealthy young\r\n     lady, the young couple, according to the Parisian custom of\r\n     the time, lived with their parents; who, rich as they were,\r\n     desiring to be richer still, had let out their splendid\r\n     hotel up to the fourth story. In this fourth story the whole\r\n     family lived together. After the Parisian finery, I was not\r\n     less struck with the Parisian filth of those days; and, in\r\n     truth, I should vainly try to paint my amazement on finding\r\n     myself compelled, while ascending the staircase, which was\r\n     actually plastered with dirt, to hold up my dress as high as\r\n     possible in order to appear tolerably clean in the\r\n     ball-room.\r\n\r\nBut if modern Paris has improved in this respect, it has, on the other\r\nhand, we are told, lost far more in the chapter of manners. The\r\ngeneration born during the first Revolution still preserved some of\r\nthe older style of social bearing; but, in the present descendants, we\r\nmay now vainly seek for any of the graces that once gave to France her\r\nEuropean credit for politeness.\r\n\r\nThe French, after lording it over the capitals of Europe for so many\r\nyears, were impatient to the last degree of the retribution which the\r\nallied armies brought to their own doors in 1816. Even a returning\r\n_emigre_ could not restrain his rage on finding that--\r\n\r\n     foreigners held the fortresses, and that he had to submit\r\n     his passport for a _vise_ to Prussian, Russian, or English\r\n     authorities; and he lost all command of himself at the idea\r\n     of the prostration of the _grande gloire Francaise_.... The\r\n     same wrath at the occupation of France by foreign troops--an\r\n     occupation which lasted for hardly three years--whereas the\r\n     French had ravaged Germany for full twenty, from the siege\r\n     of Mentz to the battle of Leipsic, was then felt in Paris by\r\n     all classes. Every little theatre on the Boulevards played\r\n     some piece referring to it in all the _refrains_ urging the\r\n     foreigners to be off at once; all the print-shops were full\r\n     of caricatures of the English and Russians. The German\r\n     soldiers, by-the-by, were, without exception, called\r\n     Prussians. At that time there was less hatred expressed\r\n     towards the Russians; in the theatres even the people would\r\n     point with curiosity to Lostopchin, the author of the\r\n     conflagration at Moscow. The hatred of the Russians grew\r\n     much more decided under Nicholas. Alexander, on the\r\n     contrary, was personally popular. Strictly speaking, the\r\n     Prussians were detested; while the English, on the contrary,\r\n     served as a perpetual butt for ridicule and wit. Their\r\n     language, gestures, dress, afforded a complete series of\r\n     dramas and caricatures.\r\n\r\nThis soreness of France under a very light application of her own\r\nContinental system, brings to mind an anecdote from the papers of the\r\ntime, which is worth preserving:--\r\n\r\n     When the Prussian army entered Paris, one of its officers\r\n     made particular interest to be quartered in a certain hotel\r\n     in the Faubourg St Germain, the residence of a widow lady of\r\n     rank. On taking possession of his billet, the Colonel at\r\n     once haughtily refused the apartments offered him; and,\r\n     after a survey of the premises, insisted on having the best\r\n     suite on the first floor, then occupied by the lady of the\r\n     house herself. She protested and entreated in vain--the\r\n     Colonel was harsh and peremptory,--the lady had to abandon\r\n     her sitting-room, boudoir, and bed-room, and content herself\r\n     with the chambers intended for the officer. From these,\r\n     however, she was as rudely dislodged on the next day, the\r\n     Colonel demanding them for his orderly, and the lady had at\r\n     last to creep into a servant's garret. This was not all. On\r\n     first taking possession of his rooms the officer had\r\n     summoned the _maitre d'hotel_, and commanded a rich dinner\r\n     of twelve covers for the entertainment of a party of his\r\n     comrades. They came--the cellar had to yield its choicest\r\n     wines; the house was filled with bacchanalian uproar. The\r\n     orgy was repeated both on the next day and on the next\r\n     following. On the morning afterwards the officer presented\r\n     himself before the lady of the house. \"You are perhaps\r\n     somewhat annoyed by my proceedings in your hotel?\"\r\n     \"Certainly,\" was the reply, \"I think I have cause to\r\n     complain of the manner in which the law of the strongest has\r\n     been used here, in defiance of the commonest regard due to\r\n     my sex and age. I have been roughly expelled from every\r\n     habitable room in my own house, and thrust into a garret; my\r\n     servants have been maltreated; with my plate and provisions\r\n     and the best of my cellar, you have forced them to wait on\r\n     the riotous feasting of your comrades. I have appealed to\r\n     your generosity, to your courtesy, but in vain. I protest\r\n     against such conduct. It is unworthy of a soldier.\" \"Madam,\"\r\n     replied the Prussian, \"what you say is perfectly true. Such\r\n     conduct is brutal and unbecoming. I have the honor to inform\r\n     you that what you have justly complained of for the last\r\n     three days is but a faint copy of the manner in which your\r\n     son daily behaved himself in my mother's house in Berlin\r\n     _for more than six months_ after the Battle of Jena. From me\r\n     you shall have no further annoyance. I shall now retire to\r\n     an inn. The hotel is entirely at your own disposal.\" The\r\n     lady blushed, and was silent.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly choose amiss among the portrait sketches. Here is the\r\nPrincess of Chimay, once celebrated as the fair Spanish Cabarus--or\r\nMadame Tallien of the \"18th Brumaire.\" After giving up a name which\r\nshe had no legal right to bear, she married the Count Caraman before\r\nhe succeeded to a princely title. In 1818, this heroine--\r\n\r\n     was some forty years old. Her age was partly open to\r\n     positive proof, as in '94 she was known to have just reached\r\n     her twentieth year--it was partly shown by a fulness of\r\n     person, rather tending to corpulence, which betrayed the\r\n     retreat of her younger bloom; but still you would rarely\r\n     find another beauty so well preserved, or a general\r\n     appearance equally imposing. Tall, full, gorgeous, she\r\n     reminded you of the historical beauties of antiquity. Such a\r\n     figure you might imagine as an Ariadne, Dido, or Cleopatra.\r\n     With a perfect bust, arms, and shoulders; white as an\r\n     animated statue, regular features, beaming eyes, pearly\r\n     teeth, hair raven black--hearing, speech, motion, still\r\n     ravishingly perfect. Her costume, too, had a certain Grecian\r\n     character.\r\n\r\nAmong the painters, Gerard was the lady's chosen intimate. When she\r\nfirst knew him, he had already been long famous and rich; but he seems\r\nto have taken pleasure in recalling the struggles of his early career.\r\nIt was, in many respects, a strange one:--\r\n\r\n     His father was a Frenchman, who belonged to the domestic\r\n     establishment of the Cardinal de Bernis, then ambassador at\r\n     Rome. His mother, whose name was Tortoni, was the daughter\r\n     of a plain Roman citizen. In 1782, Gerard's parents, with\r\n     their three boys, of whom Francois, the eldest, was now\r\n     twelve, returned to France, where the father died in 1789. A\r\n     year afterwards the widow went back with her children to her\r\n     own country, but had to return to France once more, for the\r\n     preservation of a small income important in her narrow\r\n     circumstances. On this occasion, besides her sons, she came\r\n     back with her little brother Tortoni and his infant sister,\r\n     some years younger than her eldest son Francois. Thus there\r\n     was in the house an aunt younger than her nephew.\r\n\r\nThe family found it hard enough to live at all in Paris: and when\r\nFrancois's great talent for drawing revealed itself, the household\r\nmeans were further pinched to provide him with paper and pencils.\r\nUnder all obstacles, however, his powers soon grew evident: he got at\r\nlast an introduction to David, and became his pupil:--\r\n\r\n     Gerard was created the perfect opposite, both physically and\r\n     morally, of David. David was tall, with distorted features,\r\n     rough, furious, cruel. Gerard was small, with a pleasing,\r\n     regular physiognomy, delicate, soft, generous.... He would\r\n     often tell how he was forced in those days (during the reign\r\n     of terror) to deceive his master David, in order to preserve\r\n     his own life. David, who in his zeal for reforming the world\r\n     had become one of the most active members of the Committee\r\n     of Safety, was incessantly busied in providing that bloody\r\n     tribunal with familiars. Every one belonging to him, who\r\n     desired his own preservation, was forced either to adopt\r\n     republicanism in David's sense, or to evade it by some kind\r\n     of deception. Gerard, although in perfect health, escaped\r\n     the honor designed him by feigning sickness; and went about\r\n     in public on crutches, which, however, he threw down the\r\n     instant he knew himself safe from observation. Gerard's\r\n     mother had died in 1792. Her brother, the painter's uncle,\r\n     now a grown youth, took up the queer fancy of showing the\r\n     Parisians the excellent manner in which the Romans are\r\n     skilled in making confectioner's ices. The success of the\r\n     _Cafe Tortoni_, on the _Boulevard des Italiens_, has now\r\n     been for some fifty years known to all Europe. One of the\r\n     children (Gerard) was dead, the youngest provided for\r\n     elsewhere; and thus, after his mother's death, the young\r\n     painter of two-and-twenty was left alone with his aunt,\r\n     Mlle. Tortoni, who was but two years his junior. She became\r\n     his wife. When relating the above, she would add, with\r\n     _naivete_, \"At that time my nephew was in a manner forced to\r\n     marry me, unless he chose to turn me out into the street. We\r\n     were poor, but contented. Gerard's talent, as yet little\r\n     known, and destitute of suitable means for its exercise,\r\n     supported us, however, barely; and I continued to sew, darn,\r\n     cook, carry water, and cut wood for our little household, as\r\n     I had been wont to do before, when assisting his mother, my\r\n     sister. In those days there was no marrying in the church,\r\n     no priest, no banns. A few days after the death of my\r\n     sister, we appeared in our poor work-a-day clothes, before\r\n     the _maire_. He joined our hands, and then we became a\r\n     couple.\"\r\n\r\nSome months were passed in this obscure poverty, until calmer times\r\nprevailed in Paris. Isabey had somehow become aware of the young\r\npainter's talent, and now urged him to exhibit a picture at the first\r\nExhibition. Gerard produced the sketch of his _Belisaire_;[5] but\r\ndeclared he had no means to paint it on a grand scale. Isabey hereupon\r\nassisted him; and, after the picture was finished and exhibited with\r\nsuccess, procured him a purchaser, at the price of 100 Louis d'or.\r\n\r\n     \"On the receipt of this sum,\" Madame Gerard went on, \"we\r\n     were nearly losing our wits for joy. We were ravished, like\r\n     mere children, by the glitter of the shining gold, which we\r\n     kept again and again rolling through our fingers. We, who\r\n     until now could not even afford to buy a common candlestick,\r\n     so that we had to cut a hole in our poor wooden table to\r\n     stick the rushlight in,--we now had a hundred louis!\" By\r\n     degrees Gerard advanced to a high European name; but those\r\n     only who knew him personally could have any idea of his\r\n     amiable, refined nature, of his pleasant conversation, of\r\n     the various acquirements and highly intellectual\r\n     peculiarities of this eminent man, who took up with equal\r\n     clearness many of the most dissimilar sciences. You forgot\r\n     time with him, or gladly gave him up the whole night, as he\r\n     seldom made his appearance in company at his own house\r\n     before ten.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the grim figure of the old Revolution for more modern\r\nsketches, we must correct the lady's statement of its victims, in\r\nwhich she quite exceeds the utmost latitude of feminine gossip. \"_Two\r\nmillions of heads_\" she assigns as the food of the devouring\r\nguillotine--a number transcendent, even for lady rhetoric. It is some\r\n_five hundred_ times more than the largest estimate of those even who\r\nhave done their best to aggravate the tale of its horrors. The\r\nConvention, when grown Anti-Jacobin, and anxious, of course, to\r\njustify its destruction of Robespierre and his fellows, it published\r\nlists of the sufferers, could not bring the number of the guillotined\r\nup to a full _two_ thousand. Montgaillard, who complains that the\r\nreturns were incomplete, may be taken as the author of the most\r\nextreme calculation on this subject: he does not get beyond a total of\r\n_four_ thousand victims, including those who perished by _fusillades_\r\nand _noyades_. Even an anonymous lady cannot be suffered to pass with\r\nsuch a terrific exaggeration unquestioned. In 1823, she was present at\r\nan opening of the Chambers by \"Louis the Desired,\" now grown fatter,\r\nit seems, than was desirable for such an operation. Indeed--\r\n\r\n     he could no longer walk; on this account the session was\r\n     held in the Louvre; and the manner in which he suddenly\r\n     pushed out on his low rolling chair, from beneath a curtain,\r\n     which was quickly drawn back, as it is done on the stage,\r\n     and as rapidly closed again, had an effect at once painful\r\n     and ludicrous. Both these feelings were increased by the\r\n     shrill piping treble which came squeaking forth from this\r\n     unlucky corpulent body.... His brother, the Comte d'Artois,\r\n     afterwards Charles the Tenth, was tall and thin, and had\r\n     retained to his advanced age that habit of shuffling about\r\n     with his legs, which teachers and governors had vainly tried\r\n     to cure him of while young. He could not keep his body still\r\n     for a single instant. His protruded head, his mouth always\r\n     open, would of themselves have seemed to indicate mere\r\n     stupidity rather than cunning, had not this impression been\r\n     contradicted, partly by the vivacity of his eyes, and partly\r\n     by his too notorious habit of intriguing. This idiotic air\r\n     of poking forward the head, with the mouth always open--but\r\n     aggravated by quite lifeless and almost totally closed\r\n     eyes--was apparent in a still higher degree in his eldest\r\n     son, the Duke of Angouleme. In the face of his wife there\r\n     were still visible some traces, if not of a former beauty,\r\n     at least of something characteristic and noble. In spite of\r\n     her withered, lean figure, her gait was firm and majestic;\r\n     but the terrorists of the Revolution had heaped misery of\r\n     every kind in double and three-fold measure on this unhappy\r\n     daughter of Louis the Sixteenth, and their cannibal severity\r\n     had broken her heart for ever.... The Duchess of Berri, a\r\n     Neapolitan princess, wife of the youngest son of the Count\r\n     d'Artois, was young, but had been ill-treated by nature in\r\n     her outward appearance. She was short, thin, with hair\r\n     blonde almost to whiteness, and a kind of reddish fairness\r\n     of complexion. In her irregular features, in her eyes which\r\n     all but squinted, no kind of expression could be\r\n     detected--not even that of frivolity, which she was accused\r\n     of.... To both these ladies the rigorously-prescribed\r\n     court-dress, as worn in open day, without candlelight, was\r\n     very unbecoming. It consisted of a short white satin dress,\r\n     called _jupe_, which means a dress without a train; the\r\n     front breadth richly embroidered with gold, with a cut-out\r\n     body, and short sleeves, leaving the neck and arms\r\n     bare,--the effect of which was absolutely pitiable on the\r\n     superannuated, yellow, and withered Duchess of Angouleme.\r\n     Around the waist a golden ceinture held up a colored velvet\r\n     skirt, with an enormous train, but no body. In front, this\r\n     kind of outer dress, called _manteau de cour_, was open, and\r\n     trimmed all round with broad lace. The head was decorated,\r\n     or rather disfigured, by a thick upright plume of tall white\r\n     ostrich feathers, to which were attached behind two long\r\n     ends of blonde lace, called _barbes_, which hung down the\r\n     back. On the forehead a closely-fitting jewelled diadem was\r\n     worn, and diamond ornaments on the neck and arms, according\r\n     to the usual fashion.\r\n\r\nFrom such court scarecrows let us turn to keep a last corner for a\r\nfigure of more modern and genial appearance--though this, too, was\r\nsaddening, and is now, like the rest, grown a mere shadow. The lady\r\nsaw much of the musician Chopin after 1832, and speaks of him with\r\nwarm affection, and with a fine feeling of his genius:--\r\n\r\n     He was a delicate, graceful figure, in the highest degree\r\n     attractive--the whole man a mere breath--rather a spiritual\r\n     than a bodily substance,--all harmony, like his playing. His\r\n     way of speaking, too, was like the character of his\r\n     art--soft, fluctuating, murmuring. The son of a French\r\n     father and of a Polish mother, in him the Romance and\r\n     Sclavonic dialects were combined, as it were, in one perfect\r\n     harmony. He seemed, indeed, hardly to touch the piano; you\r\n     might have fancied he would do quite as well without as with\r\n     the instrument: you thought no more of the mechanism,--but\r\n     listened to flute-like murmurs, and dreamed of hearing\r\n     AEolian harps stirred by the ethereal breathings of the wind;\r\n     and with all this--in his whole wide sphere of talents given\r\n     to him alone--always obliging, modest, unexacting! He was no\r\n     pianoforte player of the modern sort: he had fashioned his\r\n     art quite alone in his own way, and it was something\r\n     indescribable. In private rooms as well as in concerts, he\r\n     would steal quietly, unaffectedly, to the piano; was content\r\n     with any kind of seat; showed at once, by his simple dress\r\n     and natural demeanor, that he abhorred every kind of grimace\r\n     and quackery; and began, without any prelude, his\r\n     performance. How feeling it was--how full of soul!... When I\r\n     first knew him, though far from strong, he still enjoyed\r\n     good health; he was very gay, even satirical, but always\r\n     with moderation and good taste. He possessed an\r\n     inconceivable comic gift of mimicry, and in private circles\r\n     of friends he diffused the utmost cheerfulness both by his\r\n     genius and his good spirits.... Halle has now the best\r\n     tradition of his manner.\r\n\r\nWe pause, not for want of matter, but for want of room. Besides its\r\nlively sketches, the book contains some materials of a tragic\r\ninterest--to which we may return.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] It is now, or was not long since, at Munich, in the Leuchtenburg\r\nGallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST JOSEPH IN EGYPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA writer in the July number of _Bentley's Miscellany_ describes some\r\nofficial experiences in Egypt during the reign of Mehemet Ali, and\r\namong various curious incidents has the following of Boghos Bey, the\r\nprime minister of the Pacha, who then played a no inconsiderable part\r\non the stage of European diplomacy, more particularly as relating to\r\nthe, at that period, all-engrossing \"Eastern Question.\"\r\n\r\n\"By birth an Armenian, in early life Boghos Bey was dragoman or\r\ninterpreter to Mr. Wherry, then English consul at Smyrna; but he gave\r\nup that appointment, to accompany, in a similar capacity, the Turkish\r\narmy, which, during the occupation of Egypt by the French, was sent to\r\nco-operate at Alexandria with Sir Ralph Abercrombie's British force.\r\nAt the close of the war, on the expulsion of the French, he remained\r\nin Egypt, where he attached himself to the rising fortunes of Mehemet\r\nAli, with whom he successively occupied the post of interpreter,\r\nsecretary, and finally that of prime minister, when his master--from\r\nthe Albanian adventurer--became the self-elected successor of the\r\nPharaohs and Ptolomies.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion, Boghos having got into disgrace, Mehemet Ali ordered\r\nhis prime minister to be placed in a sack and thrown into the Nile. It\r\nwas supposed that this cruel sentence had been duly carried into\r\neffect. However, the British consul in Egypt at that time, managed to\r\nget something else smuggled into the sack, whilst he smuggled old\r\nBoghos into his own residence, where the latter long remained\r\nconcealed, until, on one occasion, the financial accounts got so\r\nentangled, that Mehemet Ali expressed to the British consul his regret\r\nthat Boghos Bey was no longer there to unravel the complicated web of\r\ndifficulties in which he found himself entangled: whereupon old Boghos\r\nwas produced, pardoned, reinstated in his office, acquired more\r\ninfluence than ever, and was, at the time referred to, the very\r\n'Joseph' of the land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH IN AMERICA: BY THE AUTHOR OF \"SAM SLICK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Haliburton obtained some notoriety and a certain degree of\r\npopularity by his broad caricatures of common life in New England.\r\nThese books did not display very eminent ability even for the rather\r\nlow and mean field in which the author found congenial occupation, but\r\nthe old jokes transplanted into our republican soil had a seeming\r\nfreshness in the eyes of buyers of cheap books, and they were\r\nprofitable to paper-makers and printers, until the patience of the\r\npublic could tolerate no more of their monotonous vulgarity. Judge\r\nHaliburton has since essayed a more serious vein, and being wholly\r\nwithout originality, has fallen into the old track of depreciation,\r\nsneering, and vituperation, in the expectation that any form of attack\r\nupon the people of the United States would sell, at least in England.\r\nThe unfortunate gentleman was mistaken, as the following very kind\r\nreviewal of his book, which we transfer to _The International_ from\r\n_The Athenaeum_ of July 26, will show.\r\n\r\n     \"THE ENGLISH IN AMERICA. _By the Author of 'Sam Slick,' &c._\r\n     This is a vulgar and violent political pamphlet, which will\r\n     fill no small part of the admirers of 'Sam Slick' with alarm\r\n     and astonishment. The 'English in America' are in these two\r\n     volumes set forth principally as a parcel of uncouth,\r\n     disingenuous, and repulsive Puritans, who emigrated to\r\n     America in the early part of the seventeenth century for the\r\n     sake of an easier indulgence in disloyalty and schism.\r\n     Confining himself almost wholly to the events which took\r\n     place in the colony of Massachusetts, Judge Haliburton has\r\n     thought it worth while to write a book, half declamation and\r\n     half treatise, against Democracy and Dissent,--which seem to\r\n     him to be the two giant evils that oppress mankind. It is no\r\n     part of our function to discuss the abstract merits of\r\n     either of these questions; but it is perfectly within our\r\n     province to point out the errors and faults of those writers\r\n     who imagine that they can serve a party purpose by making a\r\n     convenient and derogatory use of literature.\r\n\r\n     \"In the first place, then, we say that the volumes before us\r\n     are essentially unfair. The 'English in America' have not\r\n     really and truly been _such_ English as are there\r\n     described,--nor has their career been such as is there\r\n     narrated,--nor generally are the actual facts of the case\r\n     logically and impartially stated in these volumes. Judge\r\n     Haliburton colors and distorts almost every event and\r\n     circumstance to which he refers; and there is a coarseness\r\n     and rancor in the manner in which he speaks of nearly all\r\n     persons and parties who differ from him in opinion, which\r\n     has surprised and shocked us. There was no occasion whatever\r\n     for all this vehemence. In the first place, the facts\r\n     connected with the early history of the British settlements\r\n     in America are too well known to permit any attempt at\r\n     systematic and unscrupulous disparagement of the early\r\n     Puritan colonists to be in any important degree successful.\r\n     In the next place, the questions which Judge Haliburton\r\n     professes to consider have been for all practical purposes\r\n     discussed and decided long ago. In the last place, we are\r\n     quite sure that no writer on questions of colonial policy\r\n     could more effectually cut himself off from all sympathy and\r\n     influence than by the adoption of an excited and menacing\r\n     tone.\r\n\r\n     \"We find in the introductory chapter to these volumes a\r\n     statement to the effect that one of the chief objects in\r\n     writing them has been to inform Englishmen that Democracy\r\n     did not appear for the first time in America during the War\r\n     of Independence; and that the peculiar form of religion that\r\n     prevailed at an early period in the New England States\r\n     exerted a very powerful influence over their politics and\r\n     modes of government. Surely there is nothing new in all\r\n     this. There is no great discovery here which required for\r\n     its introduction the expenditure of so much labor and\r\n     vehemence. We had imagined that the great orations of Burke\r\n     on Conciliation with America had exhausted long ago not only\r\n     all the facts but most of the philosophy which is contained\r\n     in the general view now revived by the author of 'Sam\r\n     Slick.' There are a sentence or two in one of the most\r\n     famous passages of perhaps the greatest of these orations\r\n     which seem to anticipate the present volumes most\r\n     completely. 'All Protestantism,' said Burke more than\r\n     seventy years ago, 'even the most cold and passive, is a\r\n     sort of dissent. But the religion most prevalent in our\r\n     northern colonies is a refinement on the principle of\r\n     resistance; it is the dissidence of dissent, and the\r\n     Protestantism of the Protestant religion. This religion,\r\n     under a variety of denominations, agreeing in nothing but in\r\n     the communication of the spirit of liberty, is predominant\r\n     in most of the northern provinces; where the Church of\r\n     England, notwithstanding its legal rights, is in reality no\r\n     more than a sort of private sect, not composing, most\r\n     probably, the tenth of the people. The colonists left\r\n     England when this spirit was high, and in the emigrants was\r\n     the highest of all; and even that stream of foreigners which\r\n     has been constantly flowing into these colonies has for the\r\n     greatest part been composed of dissenters from the\r\n     establishments of their several countries, and have brought\r\n     with them a temper and character far from alien to that of\r\n     the people with whom they mixed.' The speech of Burke in\r\n     which these sentences occur ought surely to have passed for\r\n     something in the estimation of Judge Haliburton before he\r\n     committed himself to the task of writing this book.\r\n\r\n     \"We are quite sensible that as far as the mere composition\r\n     is concerned there is very great merit in its publication.\r\n     The style is vigorous and lively--and not unfrequently the\r\n     animation rises into eloquence. The narrative parts of the\r\n     volumes are in general exceedingly well written; and we must\r\n     not omit to say, that during those short intervals when the\r\n     author permits himself to lose sight of his extreme opinions\r\n     he rarely fails to delight the reader with a page or two\r\n     distinguished by acute observation and good sense.\r\n\r\n     \"Still, the faults of the book are of the most serious kind.\r\n     It is incomplete in plan: for it is neither a regular\r\n     narrative, nor a treatise, nor a commentary, nor a history,\r\n     nor an article for a review--but something of all five. As\r\n     we have said, it is written in a tone highly excited and\r\n     partial; and it has the misfortune to appear before the\r\n     world as the exponent of seemingly a new, but in reality of\r\n     an old and familiar, doctrine, by employing examples and\r\n     reasonings of which very few people indeed will not be able\r\n     to detect at once either the sophistry or the\r\n     incompleteness.\r\n\r\n     \"We forbear to enter into any general discussion on the\r\n     well-worn topics of the Pilgrim Fathers and the Puritan\r\n     settlements. The verdict of an impartial age has been long\r\n     ago pronounced on these questions: and we may well deplore\r\n     the unsound judgment of any writer of the deserved eminence\r\n     of Judge Haliburton who gratuitously brings upon himself an\r\n     imputation of outrageous eccentricity by attempting to\r\n     unsettle, on his own single authority, conclusions so well\r\n     and so long established....\r\n\r\n     \"There is a great deal said in these volumes in\r\n     disparagement of the early New Englanders. They are\r\n     stigmatized as turbulent, schismatic, dishonest,\r\n     revolutionary, bigoted, cruel, and so on. These are old\r\n     charges, which have been several times placed in their true\r\n     light; and it is needless again to undertake a defence and\r\n     to enter into explanations which are familiar to most\r\n     educated persons. We are not the indiscriminate admirers of\r\n     the policy pursued by the first colonists of Massachusetts\r\n     Bay; but the course which they adopted, the communities\r\n     which they built up, and the form of liberty which they\r\n     introduced into the New World can be adequately understood\r\n     only when surveyed from a comprehensive and impartial point\r\n     of view. It is at best a shallow criticism which contents\r\n     itself with the discovery that the settlers were religious\r\n     zealots, and had no particular respect for either kings or\r\n     bishops.\r\n\r\n     ... \"We close these volumes. We regret that the author has\r\n     been so ill-advised as to publish them at all. They are well\r\n     written, as we have said--and in some respects possess great\r\n     merit; but truth compels us to add, that they are very\r\n     unworthy of the author and of the great questions they\r\n     profess to elucidate and discuss.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW QUESTIONS FROM A WORN-OUT LORGNETTE.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY A. OAKEY HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust I am not _now_ impertinent, however much so I may have been\r\nheretofore. I have seen and observed a great deal. My observations\r\nhave engendered experiences. My experiences have some point to them.\r\nAnd altogether, I think I am entitled to ask a few questions of those\r\nwhom I have sometimes overlooked, but now address myself to most\r\nimmediately. I am proud to say that I never belonged to but one\r\nmistress. I was of too much value to be exchanged, lost, lightly\r\nparted with, or--I feel prouder as I say it--_sold_. Moreover, I was a\r\n_gage d'amour_. That fascinating Dr. ----!\r\n\r\nBut though curious, I will be discreet. This sole mistress of mine\r\ngave me plenty to do. Many thanks to her for it, since it has given me\r\nan insight into much that is wonderful. I am certain she preferred\r\nopera to the drama. I saw more of the stage at the first, and more of\r\nthe audience at the last. I have found much in both to puzzle me. Some\r\nthings I have solved. As for that which remains, I had hoped to\r\ndetermine for myself, but an unlucky fall from a nail has spoiled my\r\nsight. I have been now two months imprisoned in an _escrutoire_.\r\nOthers must answer my questions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I want to know why theatres and opera houses have\r\nsuch curious odors when empty? I have often perceived this fact when\r\nour carriage came announced the last of all. And why are the lights\r\nturned out when the audience have half-way reached the front doors?\r\nWhat becomes of the bills which are left behind? Do the rag-pickers\r\never break in? Where do the musicians go to through that little door\r\nin the stage? And why does the kettle drummer always glance around the\r\nhouse upon entering with such an air of satisfaction? As if any one\r\ncared for _him_! Why does the leader always stop to take a pinch of\r\nsnuff, while the audience are breathing in their boots and gaiters to\r\ncatch the first note of the new opera? Why does the fat man with the\r\nvioloncello always saw upon two strings, and leave the two in the\r\nmiddle to such a contemptuous silence and exile? Why do the\r\nfront-bench people get up ten minutes before the performances are\r\nover, and rush from the house as if the floor was on fire, while the\r\ngalleries make twice as much noise by crying \"hush!\" and always stay\r\nto hear the speech (if there is any), although they have not paid as\r\nmuch by half as they who ran away? Why does the lover, rushing upon\r\nthe stage to the embrace of his mistress, stop half way to bow to the\r\nladies in the boxes? And why doesn't the aforesaid mistress box his\r\nears for his impoliteness? And why did she say, just before he came,\r\n\"Here comes my Alonzo! Hark! I hear his step,\" when every door upon\r\nthe stage was shut, and nothing was heard but the confused trampling\r\nbehind her, which might have been the galloping of donkeys? And why\r\ndid this same lady wait for him by the side of a rosewood table,\r\ncovered with satin damask, and ornamented with a Wellington\r\ninkstand--and she dressed in a robe of shot-silk, with laces and\r\nfeathers--while he was dressed as a valiant knight of the sixteenth\r\ncentury should be? And now I think of it, why did _Mr. Anderson_, in\r\nthe play of \"Gisippus,\" visit the Roman centurion in a brick house,\r\nentered through a mahogany door, with a brass plate upon it? Why do\r\nthe peasantry of Europe always dress with the most expensive ribbons\r\nabout their legs and arms when they come out to dance at the wedding,\r\nor to drink from pewter mugs to the health of the bride? And why do\r\nthey stand like mutes at a funeral, whilst two people in their midst\r\nare plotting some horrible murder? Why do the Italian banditti wear\r\nsuch steeple-crowned hats when they creep through small holes, or\r\nkneel for concealment behind rocks which only cover their foreheads?\r\nWhy do the soldiers in _Fra Diavolo_ stand and sing, \"We must away,\r\n'tis duty calls,\" while they sit at a table drinking punch, and seem\r\nin no more hurry to go than if they were paid for drinking? Why do the\r\nchamois-hunters in \"Amilie\" continue so urgent about going to the\r\nmountains away, after the prey, before the dawning of the day, when it\r\nis evident from the very nature of things that they couldn't be spared\r\nfor such a severe service on any contingency?\r\n\r\nWhy does the lover always sing tenor in an opera? What connection is\r\nthere between villany and a bass voice? What's the necessity of a\r\n_prima donna_ singing towards the ceiling when she addresses a chorus\r\nbehind her? By what right does the head man in the chorus do all the\r\ngesticulating, while his fellows stand like militia-men? Who ever saw\r\nan excited basso bid a \"minion away,\" without trying to throw his fist\r\nbehind him? Why does Ernani's mistress wear such splendid diamonds,\r\nand not sell them to give him release from persecution? I have seen a\r\nsentimental young lady swear to share the poverty and disgrace of her\r\nlover, when she was fool enough to lay aside most precious jewels and\r\ndresses, which would have purchased affluence, and then robe herself\r\nin calico! Now, why did he permit _that_?\r\n\r\nWhy do stage heroines venture out into the woods in November in white\r\nsilk dresses? Are there never any snakes about? And why are theatrical\r\nforests always green in the middle of winter? What kind of\r\nthermometers do managers have? Why is it that three or four stout men,\r\nwith loaded pistols, allow themselves to be beaten off the stage by a\r\nslim man with a small stick? In my opinion--and I don't care who hears\r\nit--Richard the Third (whom I understand to be a natural son of one\r\nShakespeare) was a great numskull to allow Richmond to beat him with\r\nthe two dozen lanky-looking scoundrels who come in during the last\r\nscene!\r\n\r\nWhy do the fairies shake so convulsively when they soar through the\r\nair over the stage? Are stage-fairies all over the world such unequal\r\nhighflyers? Who made gaiter-boots for Juno and her attendant\r\ngoddesses, in the many classical plays I have witnessed? Did the\r\nEgyptians and Persians know how to make cotton-cloth a yard wide--I\r\nhave measured their costumes too often behind the footlights not to\r\nknow the exact measurement.\r\n\r\nWhy do people always cough in the theatre after a severe storm of\r\nthunder and lightning, and hold their handkerchiefs to their noses at\r\nsuch times? Why does the moon, in every opera wherein she condescends\r\nto show herself, stand still for half an hour immediately over a\r\nchimney? What is the necessity of a man dying for love, and singing\r\nhimself to death like a swan, when he has strength enough of body and\r\nmind to pick up three or four pounds of _bouquets_? And why does he\r\ngive them up to the spasmodic lady in white muslin, whom he has been\r\nabusing for half an hour, and declaring, in most emphatic terms, that\r\nthey part from that time forward for ever? What wonderful\r\nhair-invigorator do some actors use in order to grow themselves a fine\r\npair of bushy whiskers in fifteen minutes? How is it possible for a\r\nnoble lord to have travelled over thousands of miles, to have\r\nencountered unheard-of perils, in order to return and marry the\r\nmiller's maid, and yet to preserve, through years of absence, the same\r\ntrousers, vest, coat, and hat, in which he first won her affections?\r\nMentioning hats, why does the rich landholder, in modern comedy,\r\nsometimes go without a hat, when all his servants talk to him with\r\n_their_ hats upon their heads? Is there any forcible, necessary, or\r\n(to put it stronger) _absolute_, connection between a queen in\r\ndistress and large quantities of pearls strung about the hair?\r\n\r\nThese are but a twentieth part of the inquiries which crowd into my\r\nquestioning-box. I know they are disjointed,--as I soon shall be. But\r\nI will see what can be done for me, as things here stand, before I\r\nventure to again pile \"whys\" upon \"wherefores.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTS:\r\n\r\nFROM \"THE STORY OF A SOUL,\" AN UNPUBLISHED POEM, WRITTEN FOR THE\r\nINTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY H. W. PARKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOUR DE FORCE.\r\n\r\n    I felt myself alone--alone as one\r\n    Who leapt in joy from starry rock to rock\r\n    Across creations stream, and joyed to know\r\n    Himself alone in starry solitudes,\r\n    Communing with his soul and God; and clomb\r\n    The heights of glory, there amazed to see\r\n    The wilderness of worlds, and feel the want\r\n    Of other hearts to share excess of bliss.\r\n    Alone!--it startled me with such a fear--\r\n    A daring fear, as only spirits can have.\r\n    At once I would be every where--on all\r\n    The peopled globes where'er myself had been;\r\n    My lonely being would I spread through all.\r\n    I thought, with the velocity of thought\r\n    Which disembodied souls alone may know--\r\n    I thought, I willed, myself in thousand places\r\n    In quick and successive instants, quick as one;\r\n    And so around again, and still around,\r\n    Without an interval. Soon as a flash,\r\n    A thousand selves were scattered o'er the deep\r\n    Of distant space; and, urging on my soul,\r\n    Around and on, with energy immortal,\r\n    And swifter still, at last I seemed to grow\r\n    Ubiquitous--a multipresence dread,\r\n    A loneliness enlarged, more awful yet--\r\n    Until, in thought's extreme rapidity,\r\n    The distant selves were blended into one,\r\n    And space was gone! The universe was lost\r\n    In me--in nothingness.\r\n                          Soon it returned\r\n    And stood resplendent; space again became\r\n    A mode of thought, as thought resumed its calm,\r\n    And motion ceased with will. I found myself\r\n    Far off in outer coasts of light....\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORY.\r\n\r\n    .... The vision changed; for still\r\n    The cherub Fancy sports beyond the grave,\r\n    Led by the hand of Reason. Once again,\r\n    My memory rose, a painted canvas, framed\r\n    In golden mouldings of immortal joy.\r\n    But now the perfect copy of a life,\r\n    With all the colors glorified, began\r\n    To melt in slow dissolving views of truth.\r\n    From out the crowded scene of mortal deeds,\r\n    A group enraged, colossal in its shapes:\r\n    Self--a dead giant, hideous and deformed,\r\n    Lay, slain with lightning, while, upon his head,\r\n    Stood holy Love, her eyes upturned to Heaven,\r\n    Her hands extended o'er the kneeling forms\r\n    Of Faith and Hope....\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC.\r\n\r\n    Nor were the splendors silent all. To spirits\r\n    'Tis ever one to see, to hear, to feel--\r\n    The music of the spheres is therefore truth,\r\n    And, now, no more I heard the noise confused\r\n    Of humming stars and murmuring moons, in tones\r\n    Discordant; but as in the focal point\r\n    Of whispering rooms, so here I found at last\r\n    The centre where the perfect chords combine--\r\n    Where the full harmonies of rolling worlds\r\n    Are poring evermore in billowy seas\r\n    Of sounds, that break in thundered syllables\r\n    Unutterable to men. A naked soul\r\n    Within the central court of space, to me\r\n    The trill of myriad stars, the heavy boom\r\n    Of giant suns that slowly came and went,\r\n    The whistlings, sweet and far, of lesser orbs,\r\n    And the low thunder of more distant deeps,\r\n    Ever commingling, grew to eloquence\r\n    No mortal brain may bear. The universe\r\n    Had found a voice....\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVEN.\r\n\r\n    \"Look to thy God.\" I flamed at Him with will intense,\r\n    And soon a sea of light and love arose\r\n    And bathed my soul, and filled the empty space\r\n    With overflowing glory. All was heaven;\r\n    And all the joy, the splendor, I had known\r\n    In space, to this was but the prelude harsh\r\n    Of brazen instruments, before the song\r\n    Of some incarnate seraph, breathes and rolls\r\n    A flood of fulness o'er a tranced world.\r\n    Enough to say, whate'er we wish of scene,\r\n    Society, occupation, pleasure--\r\n    Whenever wished, is ours; and this is Heaven;\r\n    This is the prize of earthly self-denial.\r\n    Freedom, the boundless freedom of the pure--\r\n    This the reward of holy self-restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY WITHOUT A NAME.[6]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY G.

Books had been allowed him, paper, pen, and\r\nink, and all that could aid to pass the time; but Sir Philip had\r\nmatter for study in his own mind, and the books had remained unopened\r\nfor several days. Hour after hour, since his interview with Secretary\r\nVernon, and day after day he had paced that room to and fro, till the\r\nsound of his incessant footfall was a burthen to those below. His hair\r\nhad grown very white, the wrinkles on his brow had deepened and become\r\nmany, and his head was bowed as if age had pressed it down. As he\r\nwalked, his eye beneath his shaggy eyebrow was generally bent upon the\r\nfloor, but when any accidental circumstance caused him to raise it--a\r\ndistant sound from without, or some thought passing through his own\r\nmind--there was that curious gleam in it which I have mentioned when\r\ndescribing him in boyhood, but now heightened and rendered somewhat\r\nmore wild and mysterious. At those moments the expression of his eyes\r\namounted almost to fierceness, and yet there was something grand, and\r\nfixed, and calm about the brow which seemed to contradict the\r\nimpatient, irritable look.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I now speak of there was an open letter on the table,\r\nwritten in his daughter's hand, and after having walked up and down\r\nfor more than one hour, he sat down as if to answer it. We must look\r\nover his shoulder and see what he writes, as it may in some degree\r\ntend to show the state of his mind, although it was never sent.\r\n\r\n\"MY CHILD\" (it was so he addressed the dear girl who had once been the\r\njoy of his heart): \"The news which has been communicated to you by\r\nMarlow has been communicated also to me, but has given small relief.\r\nThe world is a prison, and it is not very satisfactory to leave one\r\ndungeon to go into a larger.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I am desirous of returning to my own house. Your mother\r\nis very ill, with nobody to attend upon her but yourself--at least no\r\nkindred. This situation does not please me. Can I be satisfied that\r\nshe will be well and properly cared for? Will a daughter who has\r\nbetrayed her father show more piety towards a mother? Who is there\r\nthat man can trust?\"\r\n\r\nHe was going on in the same strain, and his thoughts becoming more\r\nexcited, his language more stern and bitter every moment, when\r\nsuddenly he paused, read over the lines he had written with a\r\ngleaming eye, and then bent his head, and fell into thought. No one\r\ncan tell, no pen can describe the bitter agony of his heart at that\r\nmoment. Had he yielded to the impulse--had he spoken ever so\r\nvehemently and fiercely, it would have been happier for him and for\r\nall. But men will see without knowing it in passing through the world,\r\nconventional notions which they adopt as principles. They fancy them\r\noriginal thoughts, springing from their own convictions, when in\r\nreality they are bents--biases given to their minds by the minds of\r\nother men. The result is very frequently painful, even where the\r\ntendency of the views received is good. Thus a shrub forced out of its\r\nnatural direction may take a more graceful or beautiful form, but\r\nthere is ever a danger that the flow of the sap may be stopped, or\r\nsome of the branches injured by the process.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Sir Philip Hastings, at length, with a false sense of\r\ndignity thus acquired, \"no, it is beneath me to reproach her. Punish\r\nher I might, and perhaps I ought; for the deed itself is an offence to\r\nsociety and to human nature more than to me. To punish her would have\r\nbeen a duty, even if my own heart's blood had flowed at the same time,\r\nin those ancient days of purer laws and higher principles; but I will\r\nnot reproach without punishing. I will be silent. I will say nothing.\r\nI will leave her to her own conscience,\" and tearing the letter he had\r\ncommenced to atoms, he resumed his bitter walk about the room.\r\n\r\nIt is a terrible and dangerous thing to go on pondering for long\r\nsolitary hours on any one subject of deep interest. It is dangerous\r\neven in the open air, under the broad, ever-varying sky, with the\r\nbirds upon the bough, and the breeze amongst the trees, and a thousand\r\nobjects in bright nature to breathe harmonies to the human heart. It\r\nis dangerous in the midst of crowds and gay scenes of active life so\r\nto shut the spirit up with one solitary idea, which, like the fabled\r\ndragon's egg, is hatched into a monster by long looking at it. But\r\nwithin the walls of a prison, with nothing to divert the attention,\r\nwith nothing to solicit or compel the mind even occasionally to seek\r\nsome other course, with no object in external nature, with the\r\ncompanionship of no fellow being, to appeal to our senses or to awake\r\nour sympathies, the result is almost invariable. An innocent man--a\r\nman who has no one strong passion, or dark, all-absorbing subject of\r\ncontemplation, but who seeks for and receives every mode of relief\r\nfrom the monotony of life that circumstances can afford, may endure\r\nperfect solitude for years and live sane, but whoever condemns a\r\ncriminal--a man loaded with a great offence--to solitary confinement,\r\ncondemns him to insanity--a punishment far more cruel than death or\r\nthe rack. Hour after hour again, day after day, Sir Philip Hastings\r\ncontinued to beat the floor of the prison with untiring feet. At the\r\nend of the third day, however, he received formal notice that he would\r\nbe brought into court on the following morning, that the indictment\r\nagainst him would be read, and that the attorney-general would enter a\r\n_nolle prosequi_. Some of these forms were perhaps unnecessary, but it\r\nwas the object of the government at that time to make as strong an\r\nimpression on the public mind as possible without any unnecessary\r\neffusion of blood.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the mind of Sir Philip Hastings, however, was not\r\nsalutary. The presence of the judges, the crowd in the court, the act\r\nof standing in the prisoners' dock, even the brief speech of the\r\nlawyer commending the lenity and moderation of government, while he\r\nmoved the recording of the _nolle prosequi_, all irritated and excited\r\nthe prisoner. His irritation was shown in his own peculiar way,\r\nhowever; a smile, bitter and contemptuous curled his lip. His eye\r\nseemed to search out those who gazed at him most and stare them down,\r\nand when he was at length set at liberty, he turned away from the dock\r\nand walked out of the court without saying a word to any one. The\r\ngovernor of the jail followed him, asking civilly if he would not\r\nreturn to his house for a moment, take some refreshment, and arrange\r\nfor the removal of his baggage. It seemed as if Sir Philip answered at\r\nall with a great effort; but in the end he replied laconically, \"No, I\r\nwill send.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours after he did send, and towards evening set out in a hired\r\ncarriage for his own house. He slept a night upon the road, and the\r\nfollowing day reached the Court towards evening. By that time,\r\nhowever, a strange change had come over him. Pursuing the course of\r\nthose thoughts which I have faintly displayed, he had waged war with\r\nhis own mind--he had struggled to banish all traces of anger and\r\nindignation from his thoughts--in short, fearing from the sensations\r\nexperienced within, that he would do or say something contrary to the\r\nrigid rule he had imposed upon himself, he had striven to lay out a\r\nscheme of conduct which would guard against such a result. The end of\r\nthis self-tutoring was satisfactory to him. He had fancied he had\r\nconquered himself, but he was very much mistaken. It was only the\r\nouter man he had subdued, but not the inner.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage drew up at his own door, and Sir Philip alighted,\r\nEmily flew out to meet him. She threw her arms around his neck and\r\nkissed his cheek, and her heart beat with joy and affection.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Sir Philip remained grave and stern, did not repel her,\r\nbut did not return her embrace. The next instant, however, his whole\r\nmanner changed. A sort of cunning double-meaning look came into his\r\neyes. He smiled, which was very unusual with him, assumed a sort of\r\nsportiveness, which was not natural, called her \"dainty Mistress\r\nEmily,\" and asked after the health of \"his good wife.\"\r\n\r\nHis coldness and his sternness might not have shocked Emily at all,\r\nbut his apparent levity pained and struck her with terror. A cold sort\r\nof shudder passed over her, and unclasping her arms from his neck, she\r\nreplied, \"I grieve to say mamma is very ill, and although the news of\r\nyour safety cheered her much, she has since made no progress, but\r\nrather fallen back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless the news cheered you too very much, my sweet lady,\" said\r\nSir Philip in an affected tone, and without waiting for reply, he\r\nwalked on and ascended to his wife's room.\r\n\r\nEmily returned to the drawing-room and fell into one of her profound\r\nfits of meditation; but this time they were all sad and tending to\r\nsadness. There Sir Philip found her when he came down an hour after.\r\nShe had not moved, she had not ordered lights, although the sun was\r\ndown and the twilight somewhat murky. She did not move when he\r\nentered, but remained with her head leaning on her hand, and her eyes\r\nfixed on the table near which she sat. Sir Philip gazed at her\r\ngloomily, and said to himself, \"Her heart smites her. Ha, ha,\r\nbeautiful deceitful thing. Have you put the canker worm in your own\r\nbosom? Great crimes deserve great punishments. God of heaven! keep me\r\nfrom such thoughts. No, no, I will never avenge myself on the plea of\r\navenging society. My own cause must not mingle with such\r\nvindications.\"\r\n\r\n\"Emily,\" he said in a loud voice, which startled her suddenly from her\r\nreverie, \"Emily, your mother is very ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse? worse?\" cried Emily with a look of eager alarm; \"I will fly to\r\nher at once. Oh, sir, send for the surgeon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said Sir Philip, \"she is no worse than when you left her,\r\nexcept insomuch as a dying person becomes much worse every minute.\r\nYour mother wishes much to see Mrs. Hazleton, who has not been with\r\nher for two days, she says. Sit down and write that lady a note asking\r\nher to come here to-morrow, and I will send it by a groom.\"\r\n\r\nEmily obeyed, though with infinite reluctance; for she had remarked\r\nthat the visits of Mrs. Hazleton always left her mother neither\r\nimproved in temper nor in health.\r\n\r\nThe groom was dispatched, and returned with a reply from Mrs. Hazleton\r\nto the effect that she would be there early on the following day.\r\nDuring his absence, Sir Philip had been but little with his daughter.\r\nHardly had the note been written when he retired to his own small\r\nroom, and there remained shut up during the greater part of the\r\nevening. Emily quietly stole into her mother's room soon after her\r\nfather left her, fearing not a little that Lady Hastings might have\r\nremarked the strange change which had come upon her husband during his\r\nabsence. But such was not the case. She found her mother calmer and\r\ngentler than she had been during the last week or ten days. Her\r\nhusband's liberation, and the certainty that all charge against him\r\nwas at an end, had afforded her great satisfaction; and although she\r\nwas still evidently very ill, yet she conversed cheerfully with her\r\ndaughter for nearly an hour.\r\n\r\n\"As I found you had not told your father the hopes that Mr. Marlow\r\nheld out when he went away, I spoke to him on the subject,\" she said.\r\n\"He is a strange cynic, my good husband, and seemed to care very\r\nlittle about the matter. He doubt's Marlow's success too, I think, but\r\nall that he said was, that if it pleased me, that was enough for him.\r\nMrs. Hazleton will be delighted to hear the news.\"\r\n\r\nEmily doubted the fact, but she did not express her doubt, merely\r\ntelling her mother she had written to Mrs. Hazleton, and that the\r\nservant had been sent with the note.\r\n\r\n\"She has not been over for two days,\" said Lady Hastings. \"I cannot\r\nthink what has kept her away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some accidental circumstance, I dare say,\" said Emily, \"but there can\r\nbe no doubt she will be here to-morrow early.\"\r\n\r\nThey neither of them knew that on the preceding night but one Mrs.\r\nHazleton had received a visit from John Ayliffe, which,\r\nnotwithstanding all her self-command and assumed indifference, had\r\ndisturbed her greatly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton nevertheless was, as Emily anticipated, very early at\r\nthe house of Sir Philip Hastings. She first made a point of seeing\r\nthat gentleman himself; and though her manner was, as usual, calm and\r\nlady-like, yet every word and every look expressed the greatest\r\nsatisfaction at seeing him once more in his home and at liberty. To\r\nEmily also she was all tenderness and sweetness; but Emily, on her\r\npart, shrunk from her with a feeling of dread and suspicion that she\r\ncould not repress, and hardly could conceal. She had not indeed read\r\nany of the papers which Marlow had left with her, for he had not told\r\nher to read them; but he had directed her thoughts aright, and had led\r\nher to conclusions in regard to Mrs. Hazleton which were very painful,\r\nbut no less just.\r\n\r\nThat lady remarked a change in Emily's manner--she had seen something\r\nof it before;--but it now struck her more forcibly, and though she\r\ntook no notice of it whatever, it was not a thing to be forgotten or\r\nforgiven; for to those who are engaged in doing ill there cannot be a\r\ngreater offence than to be suspected, and Mrs. Hazleton was convinced\r\nthat Emily did suspect her.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief interview with father and daughter, their fair guest\r\nglided quietly up to the room of Lady Hastings, and seated herself by\r\nher bed-side. She took the sick lady's hand in hers--that white,\r\nemaciated hand, once so beautiful and rosy-tipped, and said how\r\ndelighted she was to see her looking a great deal better.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so really?\" said Lady Hastings; \"I feel dreadfully weak\r\nand exhausted, dear Mrs. Hazleton, and sometimes think I shall never\r\nrecover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh don't say so,\" replied Mrs. Hazleton; \"your husband's return has\r\nevidently done you great good: the chief part of your malady has been\r\nmental. Anxiety of mind is often the cause of severe sickness, which\r\npasses away as soon as it is removed. One great source of uneasiness\r\nis now gone, and the only other that remains--I mean this unfortunate\r\nengagement of dear Emily to Mr. Marlow--may doubtless, with a little\r\nfirmness and decision upon your part, be remedied also.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was very skillful in forcing the subject with which she\r\nwished to deal, into a conversation to which it had no reference; and\r\nhaving thus introduced the topic on which she loved to dwell, she went\r\non to handle it with her usual skill, suggesting every thing that\r\ncould irritate the invalid against Marlow, and render the idea of his\r\nmarriage with Emily obnoxious in her eyes.\r\n\r\nEven when Lady Hastings, moved by some feelings of gratitude and\r\nsatisfaction by the intelligence of Marlow's efforts to recover her\r\nhusband's property, communicated the hopes she entertained to her\r\nvisitor, Mrs. Hazleton contrived to turn the very expectations to\r\nMarlow's disadvantage, saying, \"If such should indeed be the result,\r\nthis engagement will be still more unfortunate. With such vast\r\nproperty as dear Emily will then possess, with her beauty, with her\r\naccomplishments, with her graces, the hand of a prince would be hardly\r\ntoo much to expect for her; and to see her throw herself away upon a\r\nmere country gentleman--a Mr. Marlow--all very well in his way, but a\r\nnobody, is indeed sad; and I would certainly prevent it, if I were\r\nyou, while I had power.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can I prevent it?\" asked Lady Hastings; \"my husband and Emily\r\nare both resolute in such things. I have no power, dear Mrs.\r\nHastings.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, my sweet friend,\" replied her companion; \"the power\r\nwill indeed soon go from you if these hopes which have been held out\r\ndo not prove fallacious. You are mistress of this house--of this very\r\nfine property. If I understand rightly, neither your husband nor your\r\ndaughter have at present any thing but what they derive from you. This\r\nposition may soon be altered if your husband be reinstated in the\r\nHastings estates.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you would not, Mrs. Hazleton, surely you would not have me use\r\nsuch power ungenerously?\" said Lady Hastings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton saw that she had gone a little too far--or rather\r\nperhaps that she had suggested that which was repugnant to the\r\ncharacter of her hearer's mind; for in regard to money matters no one\r\nwas ever more generous or careless of self than Lady Hastings. What\r\nwas her's was her husband's and her child's--she knew no\r\ndifference--she made no distinction.\r\n\r\nIt took Mrs. Hazleton some time to undo what she had done, but she\r\nfound the means at length. She touched the weak point, the failing of\r\ncharacter. A little stratagem, a slight device to win her own way by\r\nan indirect method, was quite within the limits of Lady Hastings'\r\nprinciples; and after dwelling some time upon a recapitulation of all\r\nthe objections against the marriage with Marlow, which could suggest\r\nthemselves to an ambitious mind, she quietly and in an easy suggestive\r\ntone, sketched out a plan, which both to herself and her hearer,\r\nseemed certain of success.\r\n\r\nLady Hastings caught at the plan eagerly, and determined to follow it\r\nin all the details, which will be seen hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\"I feel very ill indeed this morning,\" said Lady Hastings, addressing\r\nher maid about eleven o'clock. \"I feel as if I were dying. Call my\r\nhusband and my daughter to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, my lady,\" said the maid, \"had I not better send for the doctor\r\ntoo? You do not look as if you were dying at all. You look a good deal\r\nbetter, I think, my lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I?\" said Lady Hastings in a hesitating tone. But she did not want\r\nthe doctor to be sent for immediately, and repeated her order to call\r\nher husband and her daughter.\r\n\r\nEmily was with her in an instant, but Sir Philip Hastings was some\r\nwhere absent in the grounds, and nearly half an hour elapsed before he\r\nwas found. When he entered he gazed in his wife's face with some\r\nsurprise--more surprise indeed than alarm; for he knew that she was\r\nnervous and hypondriacal, and as the maid had said, she did not look\r\nas if she were dying at all. There was no sharpening of the\r\nfeatures--no falling in of the temples--none of that pale ashy color,\r\nor rather that leaden grayness, which precedes dissolution. He sat\r\ndown, however, by her bed-side, gazing at her with an inquiring look,\r\nwhile Emily stood on the other side of the bed, and the maid at the\r\nend; and after speaking a few kind but somewhat rambling words, he was\r\nsending for some restoratives, saying \"I think, my dear, you alarm\r\nyourself without cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not indeed, Philip,\" replied Lady Hastings. \"I am sure I shall\r\ndie, and that before very long--but do not send for any thing. I would\r\nrather not take it. It will do me more good a great deal to speak what\r\nI have upon my mind--what is weighing me down--what is killing me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to hear there is any thing,\" said Sir Philip, whose\r\nthoughts, intensely busy with other things, were not yet fully\r\nrecalled to the scene before him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Philip, how can you say so?\" said Lady Hastings, \"when you know\r\nthere is. You need not go,\" she continued, speaking to the maid, who\r\nwas drawing back as if to quit the room, \"I wish to speak to my\r\nhusband and my daughter before some one who will remember what I say.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip however quietly rose, opened the door, and motioned to the\r\ngirl to quit the room, for such public exhibitions were quite contrary\r\nto his notions of domestic economy. \"Now, my dear,\" he said, \"what is\r\nit you wish to tell me? If there be any thing that you wish done, I\r\nwill do it if it is in my power.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in your power, Philip,\" replied Lady Hastings; \"you know and\r\nEmily knows quite well that her engagement to Mr. Marlow was against\r\nmy consent, and I must say the greatest shock I ever received in my\r\nlife. I have never been well since, and every day I see more and more\r\nreason to object. It is in the power of either of you, or both, to\r\nrelieve my mind in this respect--to break off this unhappy engagement,\r\nand at least to let me die in peace, with the thought that my daughter\r\nhas not cast herself away. It is in your power, Philip, to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay a moment,\" said her husband, \"it is not in my power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, are you not her father?\" asked Lady Hastings, interrupting him.\r\n\"Are you not her lawful guardian? Have you not the disposal of her\r\nhand?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not in my power,\" repeated Sir Philip coldly, \"to break my\r\nplighted word, to violate my honor, or to live under a load of shame\r\nand dishonor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why in such a matter as this,\" said Lady Hastings, \"there is no such\r\ndisgrace. You can very well say you have thought better of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In which case I should tell a lie,\" said Sir Philip dryly.\r\n\r\n\"It is a thing done every day,\" argued Lady Hastings.\r\n\r\n\"I am not a man to do any thing because there are others who do it\r\nevery day,\" answered her husband. \"Men lie, and cheat, and swindle,\r\nand steal, and betray their friends, and relations, and parents, but I\r\ncan find no reason therein for doing the same. It is not in my power,\r\nI repeat. I cannot be a scoundrel, whatever other men may be, and\r\nviolate my plighted word, or withdraw from my most solemn engagements.\r\nMoreover, when Marlow heard of the misfortunes which have befallen us,\r\nand learned that Emily would not have one-fourth part of that which\r\nshe had at one time a right to expect, he showed no inclination to\r\nwithdraw from his word, even when there was a good excuse, and I will\r\nnever withdraw from mine, so help me God.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking he turned his eyes towards the ground again and fell\r\ninto a deep reverie.\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation had been passing, Emily had sunk upon her\r\nknees, trembling in every limb, and hid her face in the coverings of\r\nthe bed. To her, Lady Hastings now turned. Whether it was that remorse\r\nand some degree of shame affected her, when she saw the terrible\r\nagitation of her child, I cannot tell, but she paused for a moment as\r\nif in hesitation.\r\n\r\nShe spoke at length, saying \"Emily, my child, to you I must appeal, as\r\nyour father is so obdurate.\"\r\n\r\nEmily made no answer, however, but remained weeping, and Lady Hastings\r\nbecoming somewhat irritated, went on in a sharper tone. \"What! will\r\nnot my own child listen to the voice of a dying mother?\" she asked\r\nrather petulantly than sorrowfully, although she tried hard to make\r\nher tone gravely reproachful; \"will she not pay any attention to her\r\nmother's last request?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my mother,\" answered Emily, raising her head, and speaking more\r\nvehemently than was customary with her, \"ask me any thing that is\r\njust; ask me any thing that is reasonable; but do not ask me to do\r\nwhat is wrong and what is unjust. I have made a promise--do not ask me\r\nto break it. There is no circumstance changed which could give even an\r\nexcuse for such a breach of faith. Marlow has only shown himself more\r\ntrue, more faithful, more sincere. Should I be more false, more\r\nfaithless, more ungenerous than he thought me? Oh no! it is\r\nimpossible--quite impossible,\" and she hid her streaming eyes in the\r\nbed-clothes again, clasping her hands tightly together over her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nHer father, with his arms crossed upon his chest, had kept his eyes\r\nfixed upon her while she spoke with a look of doubt and inquiry. Well\r\nmight he doubt--well might he doubt his own suspicions. There was a\r\ntruth, a candor, a straightforwardness, in that glowing face which\r\ngave the contradiction, plain and clear, to every foul, dishonest\r\ncharge which had been fabricated against his child. It was impossible\r\nin fact that she could have so spoken and so looked, unless she had so\r\nfelt. The best actress that ever lived could not have performed that\r\npart. There would have been something too much or too little,\r\nsomething approaching the exaggerated or the tame. With Emily there\r\nwas nothing. What she said seemed but the sudden outburst of her\r\nheart, pressed for a reply; and as soon as it was spoken she sunk down\r\nagain in silence, weeping bitterly under the conflict of two strong\r\nbut equally amiable feelings.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the sight seemed to rouse Sir Philip Hastings. \"She\r\nshould not, if she would,\" he said; \"voluntarily, and knowing what she\r\ndid, she consented to the promise I have made, and she neither can nor\r\nshall retract. To Marlow, indeed, I may have a few words to say, and\r\nhe shall once more have the opportunity of acting as he pleases; but\r\nEmily is bound as well as myself, and by that bond we must abide.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you to say to Marlow?\" asked Lady Hastings in a tone of\r\ncommonplace curiosity, which did not at all indicate a sense of that\r\nterrible situation in which she assumed she was placed.\r\n\r\n\"That matters not,\" answered Sir Philip. \"It will rest between him and\r\nme at his return. How he may act I know not--what he may think I know\r\nnot; but he shall be a partaker of my thoughts and the master of his\r\nown actions. Do not let us pursue this painful subject further. If you\r\nfeel yourself ill, my love, let us send for further medical help. I do\r\nhope and believe that you are not so ill as you imagine; but if you\r\nare so there is more need that the physician should be here, and that\r\nwe should quit topics too painful for discussion, where discussion is\r\naltogether useless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, mark me,\" said Lady Hastings with an air of assumed\r\nmelancholy dignity, which being quite unnatural to her, bordered\r\nsomewhat on the burlesque; \"mark me, Philip--mark me, Emily! your\r\nwife, your mother, makes it her last dying request--her last dying\r\ninjunction, that you break off this marriage. You may or you may not\r\ngive me the consolation on this sick bed of knowing that my request\r\nwill be complied with; but I do not think that either of you will be\r\ncareless, will be remorseless enough to carry out this engagement\r\nafter I am gone. I will not threaten, Emily--I will not even attempt\r\nto take away from you the wealth for which this young man doubtless\r\nseeks you--I will not attempt to deter you by bequeathing you my curse\r\nif you do not comply with my injunctions; but I tell you, if you do\r\nnot make me this promise before I die, you have embittered your\r\nmother's last moments, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, forbear, forbear,\" cried Emily, starting up. \"For God's sake,\r\ndear mother, forbear,\" and clasping her hands wildly over her eyes,\r\nshe rushed frantically out of the room.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings remained for nearly half an hour longer, and then\r\ndescended the stairs and passed through the drawing-room. Emily was\r\nseated there with her handkerchief upon her eyes, and her whole frame\r\nheaving from the agonized sobs which rose from her bosom. Sir Philip\r\npaused and gazed at her for a moment or two, but Emily did not say a\r\nword, and seemed indeed totally unconscious of his presence. Some\r\nmovements of compassion, some feeling of sympathy, some doubts of his\r\npreconceptions might pass through the bosom of Sir Philip Hastings;\r\nbut the dark seeds of suspicion had been sown in his bosom--had\r\ngerminated, grown up, and strengthened--had received confirmation\r\nstrong and strange, and he murmured to himself as he stood and gazed\r\nat her, \"Is it anger or sorrow? Is it passion or pain? All this is\r\nstrange enough. I do not understand it. Her resolution is taken, and\r\ntaken rightly. Why should she grieve? Why should she be thus moved,\r\nwhen she knows she is doing that which is just, and honest, and\r\nfaithful?\"\r\n\r\nHe measured a cloud by an ell wand. He gauged her heart, her\r\nsensibilities, her mind, by the rigid metre of his own, and he found\r\nthat the one could not comprehend the other. Turning hastily away\r\nafter he had finished his contemplation, without proffering one word\r\nof consolation or support, he walked away into his library, and\r\nringing a bell, ordered his horse to be saddled directly. While that\r\nwas being done, he wrote a hasty note to Mr. Short, the surgeon, and\r\nwhen the horse was brought round gave it to a groom to deliver. Then\r\nmounting on horseback, he rode away at a quick pace, without having\r\ntaken any further notice of his daughter.\r\n\r\nEmily remained for about half an hour after his departure, exactly in\r\nthe same position in which he had left her. She noticed nothing that\r\nwas passing around her; she heard not a horse stop at the door; and\r\nwhen her own maid entered the room and said,--\"Doctor Short has come,\r\nma'am, and is with my lady. Sir Philip sent Peter for him; but Peter\r\nluckily met him just down beyond the park gates;\" Emily hardly seemed\r\nto hear her.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after, Mr. Short descended quietly from the room of Lady\r\nHastings, and looked into the drawing-room as he passed. Seeing the\r\nbeautiful girl seated there in that attitude of despondency, he\r\napproached her quietly, saying, \"Do not, my dear mistress Emily,\r\nsuffer yourself to be alarmed without cause. I see no reason for the\r\nleast apprehension. My good lady, your mother is nervous and excited,\r\nbut there are no very dangerous symptoms about her--certainly none\r\nthat should cause immediate alarm; and I think upon the whole, that\r\nthe disease is more mental than corporeal.\"\r\n\r\nEmily had raised her eyes when he had just begun to speak, and she\r\nshook her head mournfully at his last, words, saying, \"I can do\r\nnothing to remedy it, Mr. Short--I would at any personal sacrifice,\r\nbut this involves more--I can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have done my best,\" said Mr. Short with a kindly smile; for he\r\nwas an old and confidential friend of the whole family, and upon Emily\r\nherself had attended from her childhood, during all the little\r\nsicknesses of early life. \"I asked your excellent mother what had so\r\nmuch excited her, and she told me all that has passed this morning. I\r\nthink, my dear young lady, I have quieted her a good deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? how?\" exclaimed Emily eagerly. \"Oh tell me how, Mr. Short, and I\r\nwill bless you!\"\r\n\r\nThe good old surgeon seated himself beside her and took her hand in\r\nhis. \"I have only time to speak two words,\" he said, \"but I think they\r\nwill give you comfort. Your mother explained to me that there had been\r\na little discussion this morning when she thought herself\r\ndying--though that was all nonsense--and it must have been very\r\npainful to you, my dear Mistress Emily. She told me what it was about\r\ntoo, and seemed half sorry already for what she had said. So, as I\r\nguessed how matters went--for I know that the dear lady is fond of\r\ntitles and rank, and all that, and saw she had a great deal mistaken\r\nMr. Marlow's position--I just ventured to tell her that he is the heir\r\nof the old Earl of Launceston--that is to say, if the Earl does not\r\nmarry again, and he is seventy-three, with a wife still living. She\r\nhad never heard any thing about it, and it seemed to comfort her\r\namazingly. Nevertheless she is in a sad nervous state, and somewhat\r\nweak. I do not altogether like that cough she has either; and so, my\r\ndear young lady, I will send her over a draught to-night, of which you\r\nmust give her a tablespoonful every three hours. Give it to her with\r\nyour own hands; for it is rather strong, and servants are apt to make\r\nmistakes. But I think if you go to her now, you will find her in a\r\nvery different humor from that which she was in this morning. Good\r\nbye, good bye. Don't be cast down, Mistress Emily. All will go well\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nFrom the house of Sir Philip Hastings Mr. Short rode quickly on to the\r\ncottage of Mistress Best, which he had visited once before in the\r\nmorning. The case of John Ayliffe, however, was becoming more and more\r\nurgent every moment, and at each visit the surgeon saw a change in the\r\ncountenance of the young man which indicated that a greater change\r\nstill was coming. He had had a choice of evils to deal with; for\r\nduring the first day after the accident there had been so much fever\r\nthat he had feared to give any thing to sustain the young man's\r\nstrength. But long indulgence in stimulating liquors had had its usual\r\neffect in weakening the powers of the constitution, and rendering it\r\nliable to give way suddenly even where the corporeal powers seemed at\r\ntheir height. Wine had become to John Ayliffe what water is to most\r\nmen, and he could not bear up without it. Exhaustion had succeeded\r\nrapidly to the temporary excitement of fever, and mortification had\r\nbegun to show itself on the injured limb. Wine had become necessary,\r\nand it was administered in frequent and large doses; but as a\r\nstimulant it had lost its effect upon the unhappy young man, and when\r\nthe surgeon returned to the cottage on this occasion, he saw not only\r\nthat all hope was at an end, but that the end could not be very far\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nGood Mr. Dixwell was seated by John Ayliffe's side, and looked up to\r\nthe surgeon with an anxious eye. Mr. Short felt his patient's pulse\r\nwith a very grave face. It was rapid, but exceedingly feeble--went on\r\nfor twenty or thirty beats as fast as it could go--then stopped\r\naltogether for an instant or two, and then began to beat again as\r\nquickly as before.\r\n\r\nMr. Short poured out a tumbler full of port wine, raised John Ayliffe\r\na little, and made him drink it down. After a few minutes he felt his\r\npulse again, and found it somewhat stronger. The sick man looked\r\nearnestly in his face as if he wished to ask some question; but he\r\nremained silent for several minutes.\r\n\r\nAt length he said, \"Tell me the truth, Short. Am not I dying?\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon hesitated, but Mr. Dixwell raised his eyes, saying, \"Tell\r\nhim the truth, tell him the truth, my good friend. He is better\r\nprepared to bear it than he was yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear you are sinking, Sir John,\" said the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\"I do not feel so much pain in my leg,\" said the young man.\r\n\r\n\"That is because mortification has set in,\" replied Mr. Short.\r\n\r\n\"Then there is no hope,\" said John Ayliffe.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon was silent; and after a moment John Ayliffe said, \"God's\r\nwill be done.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dixwell pressed his hand kindly with tears in his eyes; for they\r\nwere the Christian words he had longed to hear, but hardly hoped for.\r\n\r\nThere was a long and somewhat sad pause, and then the dying man once\r\nmore turned his look upon the surgeon, asking, \"How long do you think\r\nit will be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three or four hours,\" replied Mr. Short. \"By stimulants, as long as\r\nyou can take them, it may be protracted a little longer, but not\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every moment is of consequence,\" said the clergyman. \"There is much\r\npreparation still needful--much to be acknowledged and repented\r\nof--much to be atoned for. What can be done, my good friend to\r\nprotract the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give small quantities of wine very frequently,\" answered the surgeon,\r\n\"and perhaps some aqua vitae--but very little--very little, or you may\r\nhurry the catastrophe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said John Ayliffe, \"you can come again, but perhaps by\r\nthat time I shall be gone. You will find money enough in my pockets,\r\nShort, to pay your bill--there is plenty there, and mind you send the\r\nrest to my mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon stared, and said to himself, \"he is wandering;\" but John\r\nAyliffe immediately added, \"Don't let that rascal Shanks have it, but\r\nsend it to my mother;\" and saying \"Very well, Sir John,\" he took his\r\nleave and departed.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear young friend,\" said Mr. Dixwell, the moment the\r\nsurgeon was gone, \"there is no time to be lost. You have the power of\r\nmaking full atonement for the great offence you have committed to one\r\nof your fellow creatures. If you sincerely repent, as I trust you do,\r\nChrist has made atonement for your offences towards God. But you must\r\nshow your penitence by letting your last acts in this life be just and\r\nright. Let me go to Sir Philip Hastings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather see his daughter, or his wife,\" said John Ayliffe: \"he\r\nis so stern, and hard, and gloomy. He will never speak comfort or\r\nforgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken--I can assure you, you are mistaken,\" answered the\r\nclergyman. \"I will take upon me to promise that he shall not say one\r\nhard word, and grant you full forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said the young man, \"if it must be he, so be it--but\r\nmind to have pen and ink to write it all down--that pen won't write.\r\nYou know you tried it this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will bring one with me,\" said Mr. Dixwell, rising eager to be gone\r\non his good errand; but John Ayliffe stopped him, saying, \"Stay,\r\nstay--remember you are not to tell him any thing about it till he is\r\nquite away from his own house. I don't choose to have all the people\r\ntalking of it, and perhaps coming down to stare at me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dixwell was willing to make any terms in order to have what he\r\nwished accomplished, and giving Mrs. Best directions to let the\r\npatient have some port wine every half hour, he hurried away to the\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring for Sir Philip, the servant said that his master had\r\nridden out.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where he is gone, and how long he will be absent?\" asked\r\nMr. Dixwell.\r\n\r\n\"He is gone, I believe, to call at Doctor Juke's, to consult about my\r\nlady,\" replied the man; \"and as that is hard upon twenty miles, he\r\ncan't be back for two or three hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is most unfortunate,\" exclaimed the clergyman. \"Is your lady\r\nup?\"\r\n\r\nThe servant replied in the negative, adding the information that she\r\nwas very ill.\r\n\r\n\"Then I must see Mistress Emily,\" said Mr. Dixwell, walking into the\r\nhouse. \"Call her to me as quickly as you can.\"\r\n\r\nThe man obeyed, and Emily was with the clergyman in a few moments,\r\nwhile the servant remained in the hall looking out through the open\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in conversation with Mr. Dixwell for a few minutes,\r\nEmily hurried back to her room, and came down again dressed for\r\nwalking. She and Mr. Dixwell went out together, and the servant saw\r\nthem take their way down the road in the direction of Jenny Best's\r\ncottage: but when they had gone a couple of hundred yards, the\r\nclergyman turned off towards his own house, walking at a very quick\r\npace, while Emily proceeded slowly on her way.\r\n\r\nWhen at a short distance from the cottage, the beautiful girl stopped,\r\nand waited till she was rejoined by Mr. Dixwell, who came up very\r\nsoon, out of breath at the quickness of his pace. \"I have ordered the\r\nwine down directly,\" he said, \"and I trust we shall be able to keep\r\nhim up till he has told his story his own way. Now, my dear young\r\nlady, follow me;\" and walking on he entered the cottage.\r\n\r\nEmily was a good deal agitated. Every memory connected with John\r\nAyliffe was painful to her. It seemed as if nothing but misfortune,\r\nsorrow, and anxiety, had attended her ever since she first saw him,\r\nand all connected themselves more or less with him. The strange sort\r\nof mysterious feeling of sympathy which she had experienced when first\r\nshe beheld him, and which had seemed explained to her when she learned\r\ntheir near relationship, had given place day by day to stronger and\r\nstronger personal dislike, and she could not now even come to visit\r\nhim on his death-bed with the clergyman without feeling a mixture of\r\nrepugnance and dread which she struggled with not very successfully.\r\n\r\nThey passed, however, through the outer into the inner room where\r\nMistress Best was sitting with the dying man, reading to him the New\r\nTestament. But as soon as Mr. Dixwell, who had led the way, entered,\r\nthe good woman stopped, and John Ayliffe turned his head faintly\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, this is very kind of you,\" he said when he saw Emily, \"I can tell\r\nyou all better than any one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Philip is absent,\" said Mr. Dixwell, \"and will not be home for\r\nseveral hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hours!\" repeated John Ayliffe. \"My time is reduced to minutes!\"\r\n\r\nEmily approached quietly, and Mrs. Best quitted the room and shut the\r\ndoor. Mr. Dixwell drew the table nearer to the bed, spread some\r\nwriting paper which he had brought with him upon it, and dipped a pen\r\nin the ink, as a hint that no time was to be lost in proceeding.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said John Ayliffe with a sigh, \"I won't delay, though it\r\nis very hard to have to tell such a story. Mistress Emily, I have done\r\nyou and your family great wrong and great harm, and I am very, very\r\nsorry for it, especially for what I have done against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I forgive you from all my heart,\" cried Emily, who had been\r\ninexpressibly shocked at the terrible change which the young man's\r\nappearance presented. She had never seen death, nor was aware of the\r\nterrible shadow which the dark banner of the great Conqueror often\r\ncasts before it.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" replied John Ayliffe; \"but you must not\r\nsuppose, Mistress Emily, that all the evil I have done was out of my\r\nown head. Others prompted me to a great deal; although I was ready\r\nenough to follow their guidance, I must confess. The two principal\r\npersons were Shanks the lawyer, and Mrs. Hazleton--Oh, that woman is,\r\nI believe, the devil incarnate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush,\" said Mr. Dixwell, \"I cannot put such words as those\r\ndown, nor should you speak them. You had better begin in order too,\r\nand tell all from the commencement, but calmly and in a Christian\r\nspirit, remembering that this is your own confession, and not an\r\naccusation of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will try,\" said the young man faintly, lifting his hand from\r\nthe bed-clothes, as if to put it to his head in the act of thought.\r\nBut he was too weak, and he fell back again, and fixing his eyes on a\r\nspot in the wall opposite the foot of the bed, he continued in a sort\r\nof dreamy commemorative way as follows: \"I loved you--yes, I loved you\r\nvery much--I feel it now more than ever--I loved you more than you\r\never knew--more than I myself knew then. (Emily bent her head and hid\r\nher eyes with her hands.) It was not,\" he proceeded to say, \"that you\r\nwere more beautiful than any of the rest--although that was true\r\ntoo--but there was somehow a look about you, an air when you moved, a\r\nmanner when you spoke, that made it seem as if you were of a different\r\nrace from the rest--something higher, brighter, better, and as if your\r\nnobler nature shone out like a gleam on all you did--I cannot help\r\nthinking that if you could have loved me in return, mine would have\r\nbeen a different fate, a different end, a different and brighter hope\r\neven now--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wandering from the subject, my friend,\" said Mr. Dixwell.\r\n\"Time is short.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not altogether wandering,\" said John Ayliffe, \"but I feel faint.\r\nGive me some more wine.\" When he had got it, he continued thus: \"I\r\nfound you could not love me--I said in my heart that you would not\r\nlove me; and my love turned into hate--at least I thought so--and I\r\ndetermined you should rue the day that you had refused me. Long before\r\nthat, however, Shanks the lawyer had put it into my head that I could\r\ntake your father's property and title from him, and I resolved some\r\nday to try, little knowing all that it would lead me into step by\r\nstep. I had heard my mother say a hundred times that she had been as\r\ngood as married to your uncle who was drowned, and that if right had\r\nbeen done I ought to have had the property. So I set to work with\r\nShanks to see what could be done. Sometimes he led, sometimes I led;\r\nfor he was a coward, and wanted to do all by cunning, and I was bold\r\nenough, and thought every thing was to be done by daring. We had both\r\nof us got dipped so deep in there was no going back. I tore one leaf\r\nout of the parish register myself, to make it seem that your\r\ngrandfather had caused the record of my mother's marriage to be\r\ndestroyed--but that was no marriage at all--they never were\r\nmarried--and that's the truth. I did a great number of other very evil\r\nthings, and then suddenly Mrs. Hazleton came in to help us; and\r\nwhenever there was any thing particularly shrewd and keen to be\r\ndevised, especially if there was a spice of malice in it towards Sir\r\nPhilip or yourself, Mrs. Hazleton planned it for us--not telling us\r\nexactly to do this thing or that, but asking if it could not be done,\r\nor if it would be very wrong to do it. But I'll tell you them all in\r\norder--all that we did.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to relate a great many particulars with which the reader is\r\nalready acquainted. He told the whole villainous schemes which had\r\nbeen concocted between himself, the attorney, and Mrs. Hazleton, and\r\nwhich had been in part, or as a whole, executed to the ruin of Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings' fortune and peace. The good clergyman took down his\r\nwords with a rapid hand, as he spoke, though it was somewhat\r\ndifficult; for the voice became more and more faint and low.\r\n\r\n\"There is no use in trying now,\" said John Ayliffe in conclusion,\r\n\"when I am going before God who has seen and known it all. There is no\r\nuse in trying to conceal any thing. I was as ready to do evil as they\r\nwere to prompt me, and I did it with a willing heart, though sometimes\r\nI was a little frightened at what I was doing, especially in the night\r\nwhen I could not sleep. I am sorry enough for it now--I repent from my\r\nwhole heart; and now tell me--tell me, can you forgive me?\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I am concerned, I forgive you entirely,\" said Emily, with\r\nthe tears in her eyes, \"and I trust that your repentance will be fully\r\naccepted. As to my father, I am sure that he will forgive you also,\r\nand I think I may take upon myself to say, that he will either come or\r\nsend to you this night to express his forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no,\" said the young man with a great effort. \"He must not\r\ncome--he must not send. I have made the atonement that he (pointing to\r\nMr. Dixwell) required, and I have but one favor to ask. Pray, pray\r\ngrant it to me. It is but this. That you will not tell any one of this\r\nconfession so long as I am still living. He has got it all down. It\r\ncan't be needed for a few hours, and in a few, a very few, I shall be\r\ngone. Mr. Dixwell will tell you when it is all over. Then tell what\r\nyou like; but I would rather not die with more shame upon my head if I\r\ncan help it.\"\r\n\r\nThe good clergyman was about to reason with him upon the differences\r\nbetween healthful shame, and real shame, and false shame, but Emily\r\ngently interposed, saying, \"It does not matter, my dear sir; a few\r\nhours can make no difference.\"\r\n\r\nThen rising, she once more repeated the words of forgiveness, and\r\nadded, \"I will now go and pray for you, my poor cousin--I will pray\r\nthat your repentance may be sincere and true--that it may be accepted\r\nfor Christ's sake, and that God may comfort you and support you even\r\nat the very last.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dixwell rose too, and telling John Ayliffe that he would return in\r\na few minutes, accompanied Emily back towards her house. They parted,\r\nhowever, at the gates of the garden; and while Emily threaded her way\r\nthrough innumerable gravelled walks, the clergyman went back to the\r\ncottage, and once more resumed his place by the side of the dying man.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings returned to his own house earlier than had been\r\nexpected, bringing with him the physician he had gone to seek, and\r\nwhom--contrary to the ordinary course of events--he had found at once.\r\nThey both went up to Lady Hastings's room where the physician,\r\naccording to the usual practice of medical men in consultation,\r\napproved of all that his predecessor had done, yet ordered some\r\ninsignificant changes in the medicines in order to prove that he had\r\nnot come there for nothing. He took the same view of the case that Mr.\r\nShort had taken, declaring that there was no immediate danger; but at\r\nthe same time he inquired particularly how that lady rested in the\r\nnight, whether she started in her sleep, was long watchful, and\r\nwhether she breathed freely during slumber.\r\n\r\nThe maid's account was not very distinct in regard to several of these\r\npoints; but she acknowledged that it was her young lady who usually\r\nsat up with Lady Hastings till three or four o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nSir Philip immediately directed Emily to be summoned, but the maid\r\ninformed him she had gone out about an hour and a half before, and had\r\nnot then returned.\r\n\r\nWhen the physician took his leave and departed, Sir Philip summoned\r\nthe butler to his presence, and inquired, with an eager yet gloomy\r\ntone, if he knew where Mistress Emily had gone.\r\n\r\n\"I really do not, Sir Philip,\" replied the man. \"She went out with Mr.\r\nDixwell, but they parted a little way down the road, and my young lady\r\nwent on as if she were going to farmer Wallop's or Jenny Best's.\"\r\n\r\nAt the latter name Sir Philip started as if a serpent had stung him,\r\nand he waved to the man to quit the room. As soon as he was alone he\r\ncommenced pacing up and down in more agitation than he usually\r\ndisplayed, and once or twice words broke from him which gave some\r\nindications of what was passing in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Too clear, too clear,\" he said, and then after a pause exclaimed,\r\nholding up his hands; \"so young, and so deceitful! Marlow must be told\r\nof this, and then must act as he thinks fit--it were better she were\r\ndead--far better! What is the cold, dull corruption of the grave, the\r\nmere rotting of the flesh, and the mouldering of the bones, to this\r\ncorruption of the spirit, this foul dissolution of the whole moral\r\nnature?\"\r\n\r\nHe then began to pace up and down more vehemently than before, fixing\r\nhis eyes upon the ground, and seeming to think profoundly, with a\r\nquivering lip and knitted brow. \"Hard, hard task for a father,\" he\r\nsaid--\"God of heaven that I should ever dream of such a thing!--yet it\r\nmight be a duty. What can Marlow be doing during this long unexplained\r\nabsence? France--can he have discovered all this and quitted her,\r\nseeking, in charity, to make the breach as little painful as possible?\r\nPerhaps, after all,\" he continued, after a few moments' thought, \"the\r\nman may have been mistaken when he told me that he believed that this\r\nyoung scoundrel was lying ill of a fall at this woman's cottage; yet\r\nat the best it was bad enough to quit a sick mother's bed-side for\r\nlong hours, when I too was absent. Can she have done it to show her\r\nspleen at this foolish opposition to her marriage?\"\r\n\r\nThere is no character so difficult to deal with--there is none which\r\nis such a constant hell to its possessor--as that of a moody man. Sir\r\nPhilip had been moody, as I have endeavored to show, from his very\r\nearliest years; but all the evils of that sort of disposition had\r\nincreased upon him rapidly during the latter part of his life.\r\nUnaware, like all the rest of mankind, of the faults of his own\r\ncharacter, he had rather encouraged than struggled against its many\r\ngreat defects. Because he was stern and harsh, he fancied himself\r\njust, and forgot that it is not enough for justice to judge rightly of\r\nthat which is placed clearly and truly before it, and did not\r\nremember, or at all events apply the principle, that an accurate\r\nsearch for truth, and an unprejudiced suspension of opinion till truth\r\nhas been obtained, are necessary steps to justice. Suspicion--always a\r\npart and parcel of the character of the moody man--had of late years\r\nobtained a strong hold upon him, and unfortunately it had so happened\r\nthat event after event had occurred to turn his suspicion against his\r\nown guiltless child. The very lights and shades of her character,\r\nwhich he could in no degree comprehend, from his own nature being\r\ndestitute of all such impulsiveness, had not only puzzled him, but\r\nlaid the foundation of doubts. Then the little incident which I have\r\nrelated in a preceding part of this work, regarding the Italian\r\nsinging-master--Emily's resolute but unexplained determination to take\r\nno more lessons from that man, had set his moody mind to ponder and to\r\ndoubt still more. The too successful schemes and suggestions of Mrs.\r\nHazleton had given point and vigor to his suspicions, and the betrayal\r\nof his private conversation to the government had seemed a climax to\r\nthe whole, so that he almost believed his fair sweet child a fiend\r\nconcealed beneath the form of an angel.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that he asked himself, What could be her motives? He\r\nhad an answer ready, that her motives had always been a mystery to\r\nhim, even in her lightest acts. \"There are some people,\" he thought,\r\n\"who act without motives--in whom the devil himself seems to have\r\nimplanted an impulse to do evil without any cause or object, for the\r\nmere pleasure of doing wrong.\"\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion he had accidentally heard from the farmer, who\r\nwas the next neighbor of Jenny Best, that he was quite certain Sir\r\nJohn Hastings, as he called him, was lying ill from a fall at that\r\ngood woman's cottage. His horse had been found at a great distance on\r\na wild common, with the bridle broken, and every appearance of having\r\nfallen over in rearing. Blood and other marks of an accident had been\r\ndiscovered on the road. Mr. Short, the surgeon, was seen to pay\r\nseveral visits every day to the old woman's house, and yet maintained\r\nthe most profound secrecy in regard to his patient. The farmer argued\r\nthat the surgeon would not be so attentive unless that patient was a\r\nperson of some importance, and it was clear he was not one of Jenny\r\nBest's own family, for every member of it had been well and active\r\nafter the surgeon's visits had been commenced.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations, together with the absence of John Ayliffe\r\nfrom his residence, had led the good farmer to a right conclusion, and\r\nhe had stated the fact broadly to Sir Philip Hastings.\r\n\r\nSir Philip, on his part, had made no particular inquiries, for the\r\nvery name of John Ayliffe was hateful to him; but when he heard that\r\nhis daughter had gone forth alone to that very cottage, and had\r\nremained there for a considerable time in the same place with the man\r\nwhom he abhorred, and remembered that the tale which had been boldly\r\nput forth of her having visited him in secret, the very blood, as it\r\nflowed through his heart, seemed turned into fire, and his brain\r\nreeled with anguish and indignation.\r\n\r\nPresently the hall door was heard to open, and there was a light step\r\nin the passage. Sir Philip darted forth from his room, and met his\r\ndaughter coming in with a sad and anxious face, and as he thought with\r\ntraces of tears upon her eyelids.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" asked her father in a stern low tone.\r\n\r\n\"I have been to Jenny Best's down the lane, my father,\" replied Emily,\r\nstartled by his look and manner, but still speaking the plain truth,\r\nas she always did. \"Is my mother worse?\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word of reply Sir Philip turned away into his room again and\r\nclosed the door.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by her father's demeanor, Emily hurried up at once to Lady\r\nHastings's room, but found her certainly more cheerful and apparently\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe assurance given by the physician that there was no immediate\r\ndanger, nor any very unfavorable symptom, had been in a certain degree\r\na relief to Lady Hastings herself; for, although she had undoubtedly\r\nbeen acting a part when in the morning she had declared herself dying,\r\nyet, as very often happens with those who deceive, she had so far\r\npartially deceived herself as to believe that she was in reality very\r\nill. She was surprised at Emily's sudden appearance and alarmed look,\r\nbut her daughter did not think it right to tell her the strange\r\ndemeanor of Sir Philip, but sitting down as calmly as she could by her\r\nmother's side, talked to her for several minutes on indifferent\r\nsubjects. It was evident to Emily that, although her father's tone was\r\nso harsh, her mother viewed her more kindly than in the morning, and\r\nthe information which had been given her by the surgeon accounted for\r\nthe change. The conduct of Sir Philip, however, seemed not to be\r\nexplained, and Emily could hardly prevent herself from falling into\r\none of those reveries which have often been mentioned before. She\r\nstruggled against the tendency, however, for some time, till at length\r\nshe was relieved by the announcement that Mistress Hazleton was below,\r\nbut when Lady Hastings gave her maid directions to bring her friend\r\nup, Emily could refrain no longer from uttering at least one word of\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\n\"Give me two minutes more, dear mamma,\" she said, in a low voice. \"I\r\nhave something very particular to say to you--let Mrs. Hazleton wait\r\nbut for two minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lady Hastings, languidly; and then turning to the maid\r\nshe added, \"Tell dear Mrs. Hazleton that I will receive her in five\r\nminutes, and when I ring my bell, bring her up.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the maid had retired Emily sank upon her knees by her\r\nmother's bed-side, and kissed her hand, saying, \"I have one great\r\nfavor to ask, dear mother, and I beseech you to grant it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my child,\" answered Lady Hastings, thinking she was going to\r\npetition for a recall of her injunction against the marriage with\r\nMarlow, \"I have but one object in life, my dear Emily, and that is\r\nyour happiness. I am willing to make any sacrifice of personal\r\nfeelings for that object. What is it you desire?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is merely this,\" replied Emily, \"that you would not put any trust\r\nor confidence whatever in Mrs. Hazleton. That you would doubt her\r\nrepresentations, and confide nothing to her, for a short time at\r\nleast.\"\r\n\r\nLady Hastings looked perfectly aghast. \"What do yon mean, Emily?\" she\r\nsaid. \"What can you mean? Put no trust in Mrs. Hazleton, my oldest and\r\ndearest friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is not your friend,\" replied Emily, earnestly, \"nor my friend,\r\nnor my father's friend, but the enemy of every one in this house. I\r\nhave long had doubts--Marlow changed those doubts into suspicions,\r\nand this day I have accidentally received proof positive of her cruel\r\nmachinations against my father, yourself, and me. This justifies me in\r\nspeaking as I now do, otherwise I should have remained silent still.\"\r\n\r\n\"But explain, explain, my child,\" said Lady Hastings. \"What has she\r\ndone? What are these proofs you talk of? I cannot comprehend at all\r\nunless you explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"There would be no time, even if I were not bound by a promise,\"\r\nreplied Emily; \"but all I ask is that you suspend all trust and\r\nconfidence in Mrs. Hazleton for one short day--perhaps it may be\r\nsooner; but I promise you that at the end of that time, if not before,\r\ngood Mr. Dixwell shall explain every thing to you, and place in your\r\nhands a paper which will render all Mrs. Hazleton's conduct for the\r\nlast two years perfectly clear and distinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do tell me something, at least, Emily,\" urged her mother. \"I hate\r\nto wait in suspense. You used to be very fond of Mrs. Hazleton and she\r\nof you. When did these suspicions of her first begin, and how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not remember a visit I made to her some time ago,\" replied\r\nEmily, \"when I remained with her for several days? Then I first\r\nlearned to doubt her. She then plotted and contrived to induce me to\r\ndo what would have been the most repugnant to your feelings and my\r\nfather's, as well as to my own. But moreover she came into my room one\r\nnight walking in her sleep, and all her bitter hatred showed itself\r\nthen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious! What did she say? What did she do?\" exclaimed Lady\r\nHastings, now thoroughly forgetting herself in the curiosity Emily's\r\nwords excited.\r\n\r\nHer daughter related all that had occurred on the occasion of Mrs.\r\nHazleton's sleeping visit to her room, and repeated her words as\r\nnearly as she could recollect them.\r\n\r\n\"But why, my dearest child, did you not tell us all this before?\"\r\nasked Lady Hastings.\r\n\r\n\"Because the words were spoken in sleep,\" answered Emily, \"and excited\r\nat the time but a vague doubt. Sleep is full of delusions; and though\r\nI thought the dream must be a strange one which could prompt such\r\nfeelings, yet still it might all be a troublous dream. It was not till\r\nafterwards, when I saw cause to believe that Mrs. Hazleton wished to\r\ninfluence me in a way which I thought wrong, that I began to suspect\r\nthe words that had come unconsciously from the depths of her secret\r\nheart. Since then suspicion has increased every day, and now has\r\nripened into certainty. I tell you, dear mother, that good Mr.\r\nDixwell, whom you know and can trust, has the information as well as\r\nmyself. But we are both bound to be silent as to the particulars for\r\nsome hours more. I could not let Mrs. Hazleton be with you again,\r\nhowever--remembering, as I do, that seldom has she crossed this\r\nthreshold or we crossed hers, without some evil befalling us--and not\r\nsay as much as I have said, to give you the only hint in my power of\r\nfacts which, if you knew them fully, you could judge of much better\r\nthan myself. Believe me, dear mother, that as soon as I am\r\npermitted--and a very few hours will set me free--I will fly at once\r\nto tell you all, and leave you and my father to decide and act as your\r\nown good judgment shall direct.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better tell me first, Emily,\" replied Lady Hastings; \"a woman\r\ncan always best understand the secrets of a woman's heart. I wish you\r\nhad not made any promise of secrecy; but as you have, so it must be.\r\nHas Marlow had any share in this discovery?\" she added, with some\r\nslight jealousy of his influence over her daughter's mind.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least with that which I have made to-day,\" replied Emily;\r\n\"but I need not at all conceal from you that he has long suspected\r\nMrs. Hazleton of evil feelings and evil acts towards our whole family;\r\nand that he believes that he has discovered almost to a certainty that\r\nMrs. Hazleton aided greatly in all the wrong and injury that has been\r\ndone my father. The object of his going to France was solely to trace\r\nout the whole threads of the intrigue, and he went, not doubting in\r\nthe least that he should succeed in restoring to my parents all that\r\nhas been unjustly taken from them. That such a restoration must take\r\nplace, I now know; but what he has learned or what he has done I\r\ncannot tell you, for I am not aware. I am sure, however, that if he\r\nbrings all he hopes about, it will be his greatest joy to have aided\r\nto right you even in a small degree.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do believe he is a very excellent and amiable young man,\" said Lady\r\nHastings thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nShe seemed as if she were on the point of saying something farther on\r\nthe subject of Marlow's merits; but then checked herself, and added,\r\n\"But now indeed, Emily, I think I ought to send for Mrs. Hazleton.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you promise me, dear mother,\" urged Emily eagerly, \"that you will\r\nput no faith in any thing she tells you, and will not confide in her\r\nin any way till you have heard the whole?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I certainly will take care to avoid, my dear,\" replied Lady\r\nHastings. \"After what you have told me, it would be madness to put any\r\nconfidence in her--especially when a few short hours will reveal all.\r\nYou are sure, Emily, that it will not be longer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly certain, my dear mother,\" answered her daughter. \"I would\r\nnot have promised to refrain from speaking, had I not been certain\r\nthat the time for such painful concealment must be very short.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my dear child, ring the bell,\" said Lady Hastings. \"I\r\nwill be very guarded merely on your assurances, for I am sure that you\r\nare always candid and sincere whatever your poor father may think.\"\r\n\r\nEmily rung the bell, and retired to her own room, repeating\r\nmournfully to herself, \"whatever my poor father may think!--Well,\r\nwell,\" she added, \"the time will soon come when he will be undeceived,\r\nand do his child justice. Alas, that it should ever have been\r\notherwise!\"\r\n\r\nShe found relief in tears; and while she wept in solitude Lady\r\nHastings prepared to receive Mrs. Hazleton with cold dignity. She had\r\nfully resolved when Emily left her to be as silent as possible in\r\nregard to every thing that had occurred that day, not to allude\r\ndirectly or indirectly to the warning which had been given her, and to\r\nleave Mrs. Hazleton to attribute her unwonted reserve to caprice or\r\nany thing else she pleased. But the resolutions of Lady Hastings were\r\nvery fragile commodities when she fell into the hands of artful people\r\nwho knew her character, and one was then approaching not easily\r\nfrustrated in her designs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by G. P. R.\r\nJames, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for\r\nthe Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\nContinued from page 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPER POETS: CHARLES WELDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the best poetry in America makes its appearance in the\r\nnewspapers, without pretension, and often without the names of its\r\nauthors. It is enough for them to write, and publish, whoever will may\r\ntake the fame. This indifference to public opinion does not arise from\r\nany want of autorial vanity perhaps, but in most cases from that\r\nmodesty which an acquaintance with and self-measurement by the best\r\nstandards never fails to produce in sincere lovers of art.\r\n\r\nRecently a series of noticeable poems has from time to time appeared\r\nin the _Tribune_, without any name or clue to their authorship except\r\nthe enigmatical initials O. O. They are by Mr. Charles Weldon; he is\r\nstill a young man, and the poems below, we have been told, are the\r\nfirst that he wrote. Their niceties of rhythm in many cases would\r\nreflect credit on the recognized masters of the poetic art. In this\r\nrespect they are remarkable; but perhaps their greatest charm is a\r\ncertain kind of subtle but masculine thought. They embody what most\r\nmen feel, but lack words to express; strange facts of impression and\r\nconsciousness, half-formed philosophies, and those glimpses of truth\r\nwhich are revealed to the mind in certain moods, as stray rays of the\r\nmoon on a cloudy night. In this respect they resemble the best pieces\r\nof Emerson, who seems to be a favorite with Mr. Weldon. In others they\r\nremind us of the simplicity of \"In Memoriam.\" By this we intend a\r\ncompliment rather than a charge of imitation. Mr. Weldon's thoughts\r\nare too peculiar to come from any one but himself, and too original to\r\nbe cast in other moulds. We shall watch his progress with interest,\r\nand are mistaken if he does not do something worthy to be long\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\n    Mysterious interpreter,\r\n      Dear Aid that God has given to me!\r\n    Instruct me, for I meanly err;\r\n      Inform me, for I dimly see.\r\n\r\n    I know thee not: How can I know?--\r\n      I sought thee long, and lately found,\r\n    Wearing the sable weeds of wo,\r\n      A figure cast upon the ground.\r\n\r\n    _Thou_ wert that figure.

GEORGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--THE GOOD AND THE BAD ANGEL.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Monte-Leone was cast down on receiving from the minister\r\nan order to leave France. So many interests bound him to his country;\r\nnot that he cherished still the hope of being loved by Aminta, and of\r\none day giving her his name. His ruin had dissipated all his bright\r\ndreams of future happiness. But he resided in the same place as the\r\nmarquise; he breathed the same air that she breathed. To live near her\r\nthus, without seeing her, without telling her of that love which\r\nconsumed his soul, was indeed cruel--it was a bitter sorrow to him\r\nevery hour and every moment. But to remove himself from her and France\r\nwas to die. And then, his political work--that work, his life and\r\nglory--that work which he loved because it avenged him of kings in\r\navenging his father, the victim of a king--in which he believed he saw\r\nthe regeneration of the world--that great work, in fine, of which the\r\nconfidence of almost all the _Ventes_ of Europe rendered him in some\r\nway the master and arbiter--it was necessary to renounce at the very\r\nmoment of accomplishment. He must abandon his associates, his\r\nbrothers, who relied in the hour of danger on his devotion and energy,\r\nand on the firm and bold will with which he had often controlled\r\nchance, and by which he had produced safety from apparent shipwreck.\r\nHad the Count been denounced? was the plan for the completion of which\r\nhe and his friends toiled known? He told Taddeo, Von Apsbery, and\r\nd'Harcourt, of the order he had received, and they had consulted about\r\nit. Their plans, as it will be seen, though difficult, were\r\nsusceptible of penetration. The house of the false Matheus as yet\r\nappeared unsuspected, and that was a great point. It was the holy ark\r\nin which were deposited the archives of the association, and the names\r\nof the agents, and if it were violated, all was lost. The expulsion\r\nfrom France of the Count might be the signal of the persecutions about\r\nto be begun against Carbonarism. At once, by means of a spontaneity\r\nwhich was one of the characteristics of the association, all the\r\n_Vente_ of Paris were informed of the measures adopted against Count\r\nMonte-Leone. The mighty serpent then coiled up its innumerable rings\r\nand then its federal union apparently ceased in the whole capital. The\r\norders were transmitted, received, and executed the very night after\r\nthe decree of the minister had been signified to Monte-Leone. The\r\nfriends during the night could not fancy why the order had been given.\r\nMonte-Leone seemed, as it were, struck by a new idea and said:\r\n\"Perhaps it has no political motive, but has been dictated by private\r\nvengeance.\" He then paused, for he saw Taddeo's eyes fixed on him. He\r\ncontinued--\"I have a few hours left to ascertain it, and will do so,\r\nnot for my own sake, for whatever motive it may have, it will not\r\ntrouble me less, but for your sake, my friends, who will remain here\r\nto defend the breach and to receive the enemy's attack.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then resolved that up to the time of Monte-Leone's departure,\r\nhe should not again visit Matheus's house, nor receive the adieus of\r\nhis friends even at his hotel. All this took place on the night after\r\nthe interview of the stranger and M. H----, and on the day Louis\r\nXVIII. received the visit of the Prince de Maulear. In relation to\r\nprivate revenge the Count could think of no one except the beautiful\r\nand passionate Duchess of Palma, who had loved him so devotedly that\r\nshe wished even to die for him. This passionate woman he had driven to\r\ndespair. For some time, though, calmness and resignation seemed to\r\noccupy her once desolate heart. The Count rarely visited her, but\r\noccasionally went to her hotel. Every time he did so, he found her\r\nmore reasonable and calm. The Duchess evidently avoided all allusion\r\nto their old relations. She inquired calmly after his affairs, his\r\npleasures, and his friends. When her mind recurred to the past, as a\r\nskiff drifts towards the river it has left, an effort of will was\r\nrequired again to push it into the wide stream of worldliness and\r\nindifference. The Count, however, was a delicate and acute observer,\r\nand sounded the abyss of her mind through the flowers which grew\r\nacross its brink. The Count then went to his hotel at the _Champs\r\nElysees_, to clear up his suspicions, and to ascertain if his\r\nexpulsion had not been caused by the Duchess of Palma. Monte-Leone was\r\nushered in and found her with a few visitors. The features of the\r\nDuchess evidently became flushed at the sound of Monte-Leone's name.\r\nThis, however, was but a flash of light in the dark, and the pale and\r\nbeautiful face of La Felina soon became cold and passionless. \"I\r\nexpected you, Signor,\" said she, \"when I learned from the Duke the\r\nunpleasant event which has occurred. I did not think you would leave\r\nthe city without seeing me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signora,\" said the Count, \"you were right. But you are mistaken in\r\ncalling the terrible blow, the almost humiliating attack to which I\r\nhave been subjected, a disagreeable event.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said La Felina, \"it is a catastrophe, and I can\r\nunderstand how severe it must be. We will talk of it by and by,\r\nhowever, when we are _alone_.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words of the Duchess were a dismissal to those in the room,\r\nand a few moments after they left. When the ambassadress had seen the\r\nlast visitor leave, she rang the bell by her side. A footman came, to\r\nwhom she said, \"Remember I am at home to no one, not even to the Duke,\r\nif he take it into his head to ask for me. Now,\" said she to the\r\nCount, who was surprised at the precautions she had taken, \"we are now\r\nalone, and can talk together safely. You tell me you are ordered to\r\nleave France?\"\r\n\r\n\"At once, without the assignment of any reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not seen the Minister and asked an explanation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not think it dignified to do so. Besides, my legal protector in\r\nFrance, the Duke of Palma, the Neapolitan ambassador, alone can defend\r\nme. I am, too, unwilling to ask justice, even, far less a favor, from\r\nhis excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said the Duchess. \"You would not have been\r\nsuccessful, for at the instance of the Duke himself have you been\r\nordered away.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Duchess was clear and precise. The Count had every\r\nreason to suspect she had participated in the affair, but wished to be\r\nsure of it.\r\n\r\n\"And has not the Duchess discovered why the Duke has done so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said La Felina. \"The Duke has little confidence in me,\r\nnot deigning to initiate me in the mysteries of diplomacy. This is not\r\nthe case, though, with the secretaries. Now,\" said she kindly, \"you\r\nmust know that nothing which relates to you is uninteresting and I\r\ntherefore sought to discover why such a stern course had been\r\nadopted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Neapolitan enemies, or perhaps your _friends_, have caused this.\r\nThe court of Naples had, by means of the Duke of Palma, pointed you\r\nout to that of France as maintaining communications with Italy, which\r\nendangered the peace of the country. You are accused of being engaged\r\nin a plot to control from Paris the insurrectionary movements of the\r\ntwo Sicilies. You may,\" said she, \"be innocent of those crimes, but\r\nyou have left terrible recollections behind you in Naples, and your\r\nname will long continue a standard of revolt and sedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"The court of Naples,\" said the Count, \"does me honor by believing me\r\nthus powerful and formidable. I do not see, however, the use of\r\nbringing so dangerous a person to Italy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess said, \"At home, it will be able to watch you more closely\r\nthan at a distance. I trust, however, we will be able to defeat their\r\nplans and keep you here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you?\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"I say that I am willing to abandon many schemes, but will not be\r\ndiverted from being useful to you--from defending you against your\r\nenemies--nor cease to be what I once was, a secret providence, an AEgis\r\nagainst danger. You know I learned this long ago, and am happy to be\r\nagain able to assume the part.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count did not know what to think, and his face expressed doubt and\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said she bitterly, \"you suspect, you doubt me, and do\r\nnot think me generous enough to return good for evil. So be it; judge\r\nme by my actions rather than my words. The former will soon convince\r\nyou of my devotion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What devotion, Signora, do you speak of?\" said the Count with\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\"Plainly speaking, of the most sublime of all devotion--of making you\r\nhappy at the expense of myself. I wish to retain you here in France,\r\nwhere the happiness of which I speak exists, to keep you by her who\r\nloves you and by whom you are loved.\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you?\" said the Count, \"would you do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try,\" said Felina. \"I have been forced to adopt strange and\r\nextreme means,\" added she, with a smile. \"You know serious cases\r\nrequire violent remedies, and I had no choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Felina,\" said the Count, with emotion, \"I have just committed an\r\noffence against you, for which I blush, and which my frankness alone\r\ncan excuse. When you were busy in my behalf I fancied you the cause of\r\nmy troubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very natural, and I am not at all surprised,\" said the\r\nDuchess. \"People in this world are not apt to repay evil with good. I,\r\nhowever, do not wish to appear to you to be better than I am. Perhaps\r\nI am less deserving than you think. Time, it is said, cures the\r\ngreatest mortifications, and dissipates the deepest passions. Three\r\nmonths ago I did not think it possible that I could have acted thus on\r\nyour behalf. Then I was but a poor despised woman, passionate and\r\ndeserted. Now I am your friend, sincere and devoted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are an angel,\" said the Count, with a deep transport of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\"An angel,\" said the Duchess. \"Then there are only good angels. But,\"\r\ncontinued she, as if she were unwilling to suffer the Count to think\r\non what she had said, \"let us descend from heaven, where you give me\r\nso excellent a resting place, to earth. Speak to me of your plans and\r\nof her you love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of her I love!\" said the Count, with hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; have not all your old hopes returned? Has not the death of\r\nthe Marquis revived your old passion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Felina,\" said the Count, \"should I talk to you of such matters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? am I not the first to mention them? You must, from my\r\n_sang-froid_, see that I can now listen to your confessions and hear\r\nall your tender sentiments. The French proverb says: _'Il n'y a que le\r\npremier pas qui coute_;'[8] I have already taken that. Treat me as a\r\nsister, but as a sister you love, and let me at least have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that my self-denial has made you happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happy!\" said the Count, relapsing into sad thoughts, \"may I always be\r\nhappy, as you seem to wish me! I do not know that I may not hope some\r\nday for her to share my fate. She once refused my hand. I do not know\r\nbut that her heart at last listens to mine; but that which Count\r\nMonte-Leone, amid all his luxury, once could offer, the poor and\r\nexiled Italian does not now propose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Felina, \"I am predestined to make you happy. By a\r\nsingle word I am about to dissipate the clouds around you, and light\r\nup your brow and heart with joy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible,\" said the Count. \"I henceforth have nothing, and\r\nhave lost even hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"The present,\" said the Duchess, \"is less sombre than you think it.\r\nYou are yet rich, almost as you ever were.\"\r\n\r\nThe features of the Count expressed the greatest astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me,\" said the Duchess. \"Yesterday one of my Neapolitan\r\nfriends came to see me. He spoke of you, and I did not conceal the\r\ninterest with which you had inspired me. He told me he had a\r\nconfidential letter for Count Monte-Leone from his banker, Antonio\r\nLamberti. The man is not so bad as he is thought to be; for, forced to\r\ngive way before the burden of his obligations, he only pretended to\r\nfail. United by friendship, and especially by political opinions, with\r\nyou, he has saved your fortune, and will send you the income until he\r\ncan arrange his affairs and send you the capital.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can this be true?\" said the Count, beside himself.\r\n\r\n\"All this can be effected only on certain conditions, that you will\r\nanswer the letter of Lamberti, which now should be at your hotel.\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone could not repress his joy. \"Rich,\" said he; \"yet rich!\r\nFortune has now its value for _her_ sake.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he uttered the last word when the face of the Duchess\r\nchanged its expression. Her eyes glared with madness, and a mortal\r\npallor covered her face.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said the Count, as he saw this change. This was however\r\nbut a flash, and by her powerful self-control Mme. de Palma became\r\ncalm and smiling. She said \"convalescents sometimes have relapses.\r\nTime is indispensable for a radical cure. The storm has passed, and\r\nthe old nature reappears but for a moment, and gives place to the new\r\nbut true friend, who rejoices with you at your unanticipated good\r\nfortune. It will secure your happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" added she, reaching out her hand to Monte-Leone, \"you\r\nmust be impatient to ascertain if what I have said is true. Go home,\r\nand you will find my prediction correct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Felina,\" said the Count, \"if your hopes are not realized, if you be\r\nnot again my good star, I shall not be less grateful to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gratitude is cold, indeed,\" said Felina. \"I ask your friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all yours,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Well, go now,\" said the Duchess, with a smile.\r\n\r\nShe was right, for when he reached his hotel, his old and faithful\r\nGiacomo, who, since his master's misfortune, had discharged his\r\nservants, and now performed all his functions, with the addition of\r\nthose of valet, factotum, and cook, was busy with preparations for the\r\ndeparture of Monte-Leone. The old man gave him a letter, saying that\r\nit had been brought during his absence. The Count opened it, and read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"COUNT MONTE-LEONE: You will lose nothing by Antonio Lamberti. He is\r\nnot a person to destroy one of our great association. You will find\r\nwithin a check for fifty thousand livres, drawn in your favor by one\r\nof the first houses in Naples, on the house of Casimer Perier of\r\nParis. This is the interest at five per cent. on the million deposited\r\nby you with Antonio Lamberti. Every year the same sum will be paid\r\ndown, and before six months you will receive security for your\r\nprincipal. One condition only is interposed on the return of your\r\nfortune. This is indispensable--that you maintain the most profound\r\nsecrecy in relation to your new resources, and attribute them to any\r\nother than the real cause. The least indiscretion on your part will\r\nawake attention in relation to means employed to save from the wreck\r\nof Antonio Lamberti your own fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was signed, _A Brother of the Venta of Castel-a-Mare_.\r\n\r\nCount Monte-Leone, though master of himself in adversity, could not\r\nrepress his joy as he read this saving letter. As he had said at the\r\nhouse of La Felina, it was not for himself but for another that he\r\nrejoiced at this return of prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"A fine time, indeed, to be laughing,\" said Giacomo, ill-tempered as\r\npossible, \"when we are being driven from the country as if we were\r\nspotted with plague. Only think, a Monte-Leone expelled, when his\r\nancestor, Andrea Monte-Leone, Viceroy of Sicily, received royal honors\r\nin every town he passed through. You, however, have no shame. No,\r\nSignor,\" added he, as he saw Monte-Leone smiling. \"Had I been in your\r\nplace, I would have picked a quarrel and killed the damned minister\r\nwho has forced us to resume our wandering gipsy life. Besides we are\r\nruined gipsies. At my age to begin my wanderings, to be badly lodged,\r\nbadly fed, like the servant of a pedler. If I were only twenty I would\r\nundertake a game of dagger-play with my minister.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very fine, Giacomo,\" said Monte-Leone, \"but the dagger is not\r\nthe fashion in France. As for your apprehensions of the future, you\r\nmay get rid of them by leaving me.\"\r\n\r\nThe wrath of the old man disappeared at these words of his master, and\r\ngreat tears streamed down his furrowed cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Leave you! I leave you, when you are lost and ruined, Count?\" said\r\nthe good man. \"Your father would not have spoken thus to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, old boy, you know well enough I cannot get on without\r\nyou. If you did not scold me every day, if you did not bark\r\neverlastingly at me, like those old servants to whom age gives\r\nimpunity--if I did not hear every morning and night your magisterial\r\nreprimands, I would have fancied I missed some luxury. Be easy,\r\nhowever, Giacomo. You saw me happy just now because my sky began to\r\ngrow bright, because our fortune is about to change, because we are\r\nnearer good fortune than you thought.\"\r\n\r\nFull of these happy ideas, and anxious to take advantage of the few\r\nhours yet under his control, in case his departure should be enforced,\r\nthe Count went to the hotel of the Prince. His heart beat violently\r\nwhen he was shown into the saloon of the Marquise, and he was glad\r\nthat her not being in the room enabled him to repress his agitation.\r\nAminta came in soon after. When Monte-Leone was announced, she felt\r\nalmost as he had done.\r\n\r\nShe spoke first, but with a voice full of agitation. \"We had almost\r\ndespaired of seeing you, Count, for the Prince told me you were about\r\nto go. You have however neglected us for so long a time that we knew\r\nnot whether we might expect you to bid us adieu.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that since the news of his ruin the Count had not called\r\nto see Aminta. He felt that every interview made his departure more\r\npainful and the wreck of his hopes more terrible.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said he, without replying immediately to her kind reproach,\r\n\"you are not mistaken, for an exile comes to bid you farewell. That\r\nexile, however, will bear away a perpetual memory of your kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will see _our_ country,\" said the Marquise, with an effort.\r\n\r\n\"I shall see my country, but not that which made it dear to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find many friends there,\" said the Marquise, becoming more\r\nand more troubled.\r\n\r\n\"Friends are like swallows, Signora, they love the summer, but leave\r\nwhen winter comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have thought the Prince and myself were like them,\" said\r\nAminta, \"and that winter was come. You have not been for a long time\r\nto see us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Signora, had I known--had I guessed--such a sympathy would have\r\nmade me wish for misfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Count, not so. It should, however, aid you to bear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are misfortunes,\" said the Count, \"which often disturb the\r\nstrongest mind and destroy the greatest courage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Signor, should the loss of a fortune cause such regret?\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if the loss of fortune,\" continued the Count, \"involved that\r\nof the only blessing dreamed of--if this loss deprived you even of the\r\nright to be happy--then, Signora, do you understand, what would be the\r\neffect of such a loss?\"\r\n\r\nThe future fate of the Count was thus exhibited to Aminta. She saw at\r\nonce that this noble and energetic man, born to command, must be\r\nproscribed, wandering, and wretched. The idea was too much for her\r\nheart, already crushed by the idea of a separation which became every\r\nmoment more painful to her, and she therefore formed in her mind a\r\ngenerous resolution.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said she, \"there are hearts which are attracted rather than\r\nalienated by misfortune, and sentiments which they would conceal from\r\nthe happy, they confess to those who suffer.\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone, perfectly overcome, fell at the Marquise's feet. He was\r\nabout to confess the unexpected good fortune which had befallen him.\r\nHe, however, forgot all, and covered the hand which the Marquise\r\nabandoned to him with kisses. The Prince de Maulear entered, and\r\nappeared surprised but not offended by what he saw. \"Do not disturb\r\nyourself, dear Count,--I know the meaning of all that, and expected\r\nit. But if, however, you are making an exhibition of your despair and\r\nmisery, you have lost your time; for you will not go. The King places\r\na high estimate on you, and will not forget you. He told me so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.--THE SECRET PANEL.\r\n\r\nThree hours after the revelation made to M. H---- by his mysterious\r\nvisitor in the cabinet of the chief of the political police, a man\r\nabout fifty years of age rang at the door of a room on the second\r\nstory of a furnished house in Jacob-street. He looked like a\r\nsubstantial citizen with a property of fifty thousand francs--or an\r\nincome of 2,500 francs at five per cent. The mulberry frock of this\r\nman, over a vest of yellow silk, spotted with snuff, and a cravat of\r\nwhite mousseline, with gloves of sea-green, and pantaloons of brown\r\ncloth twisted like a cork-screw around his legs, an ivory-headed cane,\r\nand all the _et cetera_, might appropriately belong to a shopkeeper,\r\nretired from business, living in some _thebaide_ of the streets\r\nd'Enfer or Vaugirard, and sustaining their intellects by the leaders\r\nof \"The White Flag\" of Martainville, and by witnessing once a year\r\nsome chef-d'oeuvre of Picard at the Odeon.\r\n\r\nWe will make no conjectures about the social position of this\r\ngentleman,--he will hereafter explain himself. Almost before the bell\r\nhe rang had ceased to sound, the door was opened by another person.\r\nThe latter was tall, dark and athletic, so that we would really have\r\ntaken him for the lover of Mlle. Celestine Crepineau, had he worn the\r\nmagnificent moustache and voluminous whiskers of the bear-hunter,\r\nwhich the lady admired so much. His costume, too, was different from\r\nthat of the Spaniard. He wore a blue frock over his chest, at the\r\nbottom hole of which was a bit of red ribbon, not a little discolored.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! M. Morisseau,\" said the inmate of the room, \"you are welcome, but\r\nlate. The dinner is cold. And,\" added he in a low tone, \"the dinner of\r\n_a brigand of the Loire_, as they call such fragments of the imperial\r\nguard as myself, must be hot, it being too small to eat in any other\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it always excellent, Monsieur _Rhinoceros_,\" said Morisseau.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me,\" said the brigand of the Loire,--for so the man called\r\nhimself--\"My name is not Rhinoceros. A certain African animal has that\r\nbeautiful name, as I have often told you during the many games of\r\n_dominoes_ we have played together at the _Cafe Lemblin_, whither you\r\nare attracted by my company. My name is _Rinoccio--Paolo Rinoccio_,\r\nborn in Corsica, as my foreign accent tells you. I am the countryman\r\nof _him_.\" He made a military salute. \"I served ten years beneath the\r\nEagles. You, too, adore our Emperor. Each Buonapartist has a hand for\r\nhis brother,\" continued he, shaking that of Morisseau. \"Already\r\nthinking alike, eight days ago, over M. Lemblin's cognac, we swore\r\neternal friendship. You, therefore, deigned to visit the warrior in\r\nhis tent, in Jacob-street, to share the bread and soup of the soldier,\r\nand drink to the return of _him_ of Austerlitz.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Rhinoceros,--no, no, Rhino,--damn the name,\" said the Corsican's\r\nguest, \"it is indeed an honor for me to sit at the table of so brave a\r\nman--for that reason, I accepted your invitation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, then, and let us drink to the health of the little\r\ncorporal.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he filled two glasses and emptied his own. M. Morisseau\r\nsimply moistened his lips. \"The Emperor,\" he said, on receiving his\r\npart of the soup, \"the Emperor, M. Rhino, was my god.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that of France,\" said the Corsican.\r\n\r\n\"He was my god and my best customer; I had the honor to be his\r\nfurrier.\"\r\n\r\n\"His what?\"\r\n\r\n\"His furrier. I furnished his majesty's robes--not only his own, but\r\nthose of all the kings he made. You know the Emperor used to make a\r\nking a year, and he used to insist that all his brothers and friends\r\nshould reign only in my robes. I had the honor, therefore, of wrapping\r\nup the august forms of Kings Louis, Joseph, Jerome, Bernadotte and\r\nMurat, without particularizing the sovereign princes, grand dukes, and\r\ngrand judges, who to please _him_ dealt with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To _his_ health,\" said the Corsican, and he emptied the second glass.\r\n\"You never served, Monsieur Morisseau?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the furrier, \"I marched beneath the imperial eagles. I\r\nbelonged to the glorious army of the _Sambre_ and _Meuse_. I even now\r\nsuffer in my _femur_.\"\r\n\r\n\"From a ball?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, from the rheumatism, contracted during a forced march during the\r\nwinter of '93. Having been surprised during the night by the enemy, I\r\nhad not time to dress myself comfortably, and was compelled to march\r\nfifteen leagues barefooted, and in my drawers. That, by the bye, was\r\nthe usual uniform of our army. Those who were best dressed only wore\r\nshoes and pantaloons. To dress thus, though, something more than our\r\npay was necessary, which we never got.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were then discharged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for my rheumatism became very severe. But for it I might now be\r\na general. I asked a pension as having been wounded in service. It\r\nwas, however, refused me--a great injustice.\"\r\n\r\n\"The soup is gone. It is a very indigestible food, and we must\r\ntherefore attack the enemy in his strong-holds. Two glasses of vin de\r\nBeaume will settle him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Morisseau, as he saw his host filling up his glass, \"my\r\nhead is very weak, and I have not gotten drunk since I left the\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it, dear Morisseau. I will go for the second service, which the\r\nrestorateur leaves in the kitchen. Excuse my having no servant, but\r\ntwo old soldiers like us can do without attendants.\"\r\n\r\nRinoccio went into the next room. When Morisseau was alone he took a\r\nlittle vial from his pocket, opened it, and poured a few drops into\r\nthe Corsican's glass, the third portion of the contents of which he\r\nhad swallowed. Scarcely had he replaced the vial when the Corsican\r\nentered, having a plate on which were two large pork chops, with a\r\ngravy of _cornichons_. \"The second entry will make a man drink like a\r\nfish,\" said the Corsican.\r\n\r\n\"Let us drink, then,\" said Morisseau, knocking his glass against his\r\nhost's.\r\n\r\n\"Let us drink,\" said the latter; and Morisseau's eyes glared as he saw\r\nhim bear the glass to his lips. His joy, however, was short. \"Let us\r\ndrink something better than this,\" said the Corsican, who, as he\r\nspoke, threw away the contents of his glass. \"I have some champagne\r\ngiven me by my General, one of the old guard, and I shall never find a\r\nmore suitable occasion to uncork it.\" He took from a shelf near the\r\ntable a long wire-fastened bottle, covered with a venerable dust.\r\n\r\nMorisseau was not yet in despair, for he relied for an opportunity to\r\nuse his vial on the third service. Paolo dexterously uncorked the\r\nbottle, and poured out a glass of perfumed wine to the imperial\r\nfurrier, who, when he had knocked his glass against the Corsican's,\r\ndrank it down, while the latter, just when he got it to his mouth, saw\r\na fragment of cork on its brim. He took it out with his knife, lifted\r\nup the glass, and said: \"To the Emperor. May he whom the enemies call\r\nthe Corsican Ogre, soon eat up the Prussians, Austrians, and beggarly\r\nCossacks. May he cut them into cat's-meat. May he cut off the _ailles\r\nde Pigeon_ of all the _Voltigeurs de Louis XVI._ restored by the\r\nBourbons. May he--\"\r\n\r\nRinoccio paused in his speech, for his guest looked pale and\r\ndisturbed, and seemed about to go to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"_Per Bacco!_\" said M. Morisseau, at once speaking the purest Italian,\r\n\"what did that devil give me to drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably,\" said the Corsican, in the same tongue, \"what you would\r\nhave given me, had I not taken care to empty in the fireplace the\r\nglass into which you had poured some narcotic or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ!\" said the furrier, \"the beggar saw me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, Signor Pignana.\"\r\n\r\n\"He knows me,\" said the false furrier, attempting to rise.\r\n\r\nThe Corsican, however, pushed him back, and Pignana sank stupidly on\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\n\"Curse you, Stenio, you shall pay for this!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ah,\" said the Corsican, \"so two played at the same game. Funny!\r\nand we were both good actors. I do not ask you,\" continued he,\r\nironically, \"why you came hither, and why you consented to share my\r\nfrugal meal, for I know already, and will tell you. You met me in\r\nParis, my presence annoyed you and your friends, and I know why. You\r\nwatched and pursued me to find where I lived, and you succeeded. You\r\njoined me at the Cafe Lemblin, and we neither seemed to recognize each\r\nother. I asked you to dine, and you accepted my invitation, for with\r\nthe drug you have you intended to put me to sleep, and expected then\r\nto be able to examine all my plans. You would have failed, Signor\r\nPignana, for I do not live in this house. I took this room only for\r\nyour especial benefit, and intend to give it up to-morrow. Do not,\r\ntherefore, be disturbed, my good fellow; but go to sleep, and digest\r\nyour dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will not go to sleep,\" said Signor Pignana, attempting again to\r\nrise, \"I will not go to sleep here, in the house of a man I think\r\ncapable of any thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly that,\" said the Corsican, \"but I am capable of much.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish to do with me?\" said Pignana, articulating with\r\ngreat pain, for his tongue began to grow heavy and his ideas confused.\r\n\r\n\"That you must not know; but do not be afraid, your life and health\r\nbeing dear to me. I would not deprive the Carbonari of so skilful an\r\nagent, who is so daring and prudent as you are. Lest, however, you\r\nshould be uneasy and your sleep be troubled, I will tell you what I\r\nmean, and you will yourself admire my plan.\"\r\n\r\nHalf stupid with sleep and terror, Pignana glared at Stenio Salvatori.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said he, lifting up Pignana from the floor and placing him on\r\na kind of sofa, \"lie there, and then you can both sleep better and\r\nhear me more at your ease. You will for twelve hours have the most\r\npleasant dreams imaginable. A glass will make you sleep twelve\r\nhours--a bottle for eternity.\" Pignana made a gesture expressive of\r\nthe greatest terror. \"Do not be so uneasy,\" said Stenio, \"and remember\r\nyou have had only a glass. To-morrow, at six o'clock, you will wake\r\nup, with a slight headache, but in other respects perfectly well. Then\r\nthe master of the house will come to ask after you. If you are\r\ngenerous, you will give him something to drink your health. Otherwise\r\nyou will thank him and go, for all has been paid for. You see I do\r\nthings genteelly, and know how to receive my friends. You will then\r\nleave this house, and go about your usual business, and will never\r\nmention this matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? who will prevent me?\" muttered Pignana.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you will take care not to do so. For if you own that you have\r\nbeen duped, your confederates will think you a fool, and dismiss you\r\nwithout wages. Now this would be bad--just on the eve of their\r\nsuccess. If you tell them how long you have slept, they will think you\r\nan idiot, for I never saw any one take to champagne so kindly as you\r\ndid just now, my dear Pignana. Now, adieu, for I must go. Be still,\"\r\nsaid he, pushing Pignana down with all his strength. \"No, no, do not\r\ntake the trouble to go with me--you are too kind. Go to sleep, go to\r\nsleep, go to sleep, my dear fellow.\" He left the room, and sleep took\r\npossession of its prey. Pignana felt his ideas grow gradually more\r\nconfused, and his real life pass away. A few minutes after Stenio's\r\ndeparture, M. Pignana was sound asleep. Stenio then slowly opened the\r\ndoor of the room, and glided like a shadow over the floor to the\r\nsleeper, into whose pockets he placed his hand. \"Nothing here--not\r\nhere. The devil, can it be that it is not about him!\" A smile of\r\ntriumph, however, soon appeared on his lips, for he had found what he\r\nwanted. He discovered a kind of pocket in the waistcoat of the false\r\ntradesman, and felt in it. \"Here it is!\" said he. Pignana moved.\r\nStenio paused, and then took from the sleeper's pocket a door-key. He\r\nthen left, and did not return....\r\n\r\nWhile the events recorded above were transpiring, about eight o'clock\r\non the evening, in Jacob-street, Mlle. Celestine Crepineau waited as\r\nDesdemona might have done for Othello, singing the melancholy romance\r\nof \"The Willow.\" This was to console her for the prolonged absence of\r\nthe bear-hunter, who had not been during the whole day in her lodge.\r\nThe finger of Celestine furtively wiped away the tears which dripped\r\ndown her long aquiline nose. Hope now and then arose in her heart, but\r\nthat hope was betrayed. A man with a stern voice asked for Dr.\r\nMatheus, and went to his room. Seven times hope was enkindled in her\r\nheart only to be disappointed. She became angry, and as she could not\r\nconfess to that passion in relation to the bear-hunter, and must have\r\nsome pretext, she vented her temper on the Doctor's visitors. \"How\r\nsoon will this be over?\" said she. \"All Paris has come this evening to\r\nsee my handsome lodger. What brings all these _savans_ hither? They\r\nwill keep me awake until late hours, and then Mr. Nunez will say\r\nmaliciously in the morning, 'Your eyes, Mlle. Celestine, are very\r\nheavy this morning. What have you been dreaming?' Then he will take\r\nliberties altogether inconvenient to a person of my sex.\"\r\n\r\nThe seven blows on the knocker had announced the union of eight\r\npersons, including Von Apsberg, in the ground-floor parlor, the\r\napartment through which the unfortunate Pignana used to go and come.\r\nTwo of the Doctor's friends were d'Harcourt and Taddeo Rovero. The\r\nothers we will tell by and by.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Von Apsberg, when they were in council, \"our meeting\r\nshould, as usual, be presided over by Count Monte-Leone. Since,\r\nhowever, the order of expulsion, of which he was notified and which\r\nalmost immediately was revoked, for some unknown reason, it seemed\r\nbest that he should not be present. Monte-Leone is the head of the\r\ngreat brotherhood of Carbonarism. We therefore propose to render a\r\nsuccinct account of its situation in Europe, and particularly in\r\nFrance. Its position is peculiar, and we cannot deny that its\r\nexistence is threatened on all sides. Secret and shrewd spies have\r\npenetrated in Germany the secret labors of our three societies, _The\r\nTugenbund_ at Berlin, _The Burschenschaft_ and _The Teutonia_ at\r\nVienna and Leipsic. Their chiefs, Johan and Plischer, have been\r\narrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Death to spies!\" said Matheus's seven hearers.\r\n\r\n\"This is not all,\" continued Matheus. \"The plans of Count Labisbel\r\nhave failed in Spain, and the Italian _vente_ have been discovered by\r\na shrewd police. The prisons of Naples, Venice, and Milan are already\r\nfilled with our brethren.\"\r\n\r\nThere was consternation on every face.\r\n\r\n\"We are assured,\" said Matheus, \"that the informations on which these\r\narrests have been made have come from Paris. Now, this information\r\ncould only have been obtained from our secret papers, as we alone in\r\nFrance correspond with the supreme venta of Europe. To these papers\r\nnone have access but four brothers, Monte-Leone, Rovero, d'Harcourt,\r\nand myself. We inform you of these facts in obedience to our articles\r\nof association, that you may place us four on trial.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered with deep excitement. The three persons\r\npresent of the four mentioned by Von Apsberg sat still, and the others\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n\"On my honor and conscience,\" said General A----, \"I declare that such\r\nan idea is unworthy of you and us.\" The banker F----, Count de Ch----,\r\na Peer of France, Ober the merchant, the lawyer B----, and professor\r\nC----, said the same. They then gave their hands affectionately to the\r\nthree friends, who acknowledged their salute.\r\n\r\n\"Let the denunciation come whence it may, our brothers yet are victims\r\nof it. They suffer for us,\" said Taddeo, \"and we will act for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Von Apsberg, \"we will act, and decidedly, for time presses\r\nus, and we must anticipate our enemies unless we would be anticipated.\r\nLet all opinions centre, then, without hesitation, on the one\r\nprinciple which is the basis and keystone of Carbonarism, viz., '_That\r\nmight is not right--that the kings of Europe reign either by virtue of\r\na convention or by virtue of arms. The Bourbons in France reign by\r\nvirtue of the allied sovereigns. We therefore declare that the\r\nCarbonari have associated to restore to all the nations of the\r\ncontinent, and to France especially, the free exercise of the right to\r\nchoose the government which suits them best. We all swear to maintain\r\nthis principle!_\"\r\n\r\n\"We swear,\" said the Carbonari.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Von Apsberg, \"the time of action will be fixed by\r\nCount Monte-Leone at a meeting to take place January 25th, 1820, in\r\nthe masonic lodge of _The Friends of Truth_. Until then let each one\r\nindividually contribute to do all he can towards the reconstruction of\r\nour new edifice from the ruins of the old.\"\r\n\r\n\"I take charge of the army,\" said General A----, \"the regiments in\r\ngarrison at Befort are ours, and the others will follow their\r\nexample.\"\r\n\r\n\"I take charge of the colleges,\" said professor C----.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer B---- said, \"We have many friends in the bar.\"\r\n\r\nCount Ch---- said, \"And in the chamber of peers.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker F---- added, \"There will be no scarcity of money.\"\r\n\r\nThe last who spoke was the merchant Ober, who said, \"The influence of\r\ntrade is on our side.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg said, \"We will not meet again till the twenty-fifth of\r\nJanuary, 1820. The supreme _vente_, composed of the Count, Rovero, the\r\nViscount, and myself, will communicate only with the five central\r\n_ventas_ of Paris, the representative of which you are. Be active,\r\nthen, in the _ventas_ which depend on you, members of which are\r\nignorant of your identity. Make yourself known to but one member of\r\neach venta, and communicate with Count Monte-Leone only in that\r\nbrilliant society to which the high position of him and of yourselves\r\ngives access, and where the government will least suspect the\r\nexistence of treason. Confide the rolls of our ventas, and of our new\r\nassociates to him alone, for it is his duty to deposit them among our\r\narchives. Now, brethren of right and duty, confide alone in\r\nMonte-Leone, the soul of honor and of prudence. To all others, silence\r\nor death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence or death,\" repeated his seven associates, and their voices\r\nsounded like the chorus of a solemn hymn....\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the room was deserted. The Carbonari had gone, and\r\nMatheus returned to his laboratory. The door of the library was then\r\nopened gently, and two men were seen concealed behind the secret\r\npanel. They were H----, the chief of the political police, and the\r\nbear-hunter, the brigand of the Loire, or Stenio Salvatori.\r\n\r\n\"I have them,\" said M. H----.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Stenio, \"but thanks to our associate, Count\r\nMonte-Leone, by whose aid I have brought you hither....\"\r\n\r\nThe door was shut without noise....\r\n\r\nThe next day, when he awoke, Pignana found the key of the room in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.--I. CLOUDS IN THE HORIZON.\r\n\r\nA month had rolled by since the Carbonari had met at the house of Von\r\nApsberg. They were as prudent as possible. There was no meeting of the\r\nmembers of this vast society, yet such were the advantages of its\r\nmechanism, that communication and intercourse was never interrupted\r\nfor a day. All action emanated from the high _venta_, which was known\r\nonly to the presidents of the seven central ventas, through whom its\r\ninstructions were communicated by means of _agents_ to the secondary\r\nventas; a few men where thus enabled to discipline ten thousand. Count\r\nMonte-Leone was the soul of all this enterprise, and on him all the\r\nthreads of this huge net united. The Count, the invisible providence\r\nof this invisible world, alone could give it external life and utter\r\nthe _fiat lux_ of eternity. More pleasant and delightful ideas had\r\npossession of the Count. The future occupied him with a force and\r\nintensity he thought most contradictory to his political duties. Since\r\nAminta had unveiled her heart to him, she had, as it were, returned to\r\nher usual bearing. The life of Monte-Leone, though, was entirely\r\nchanged. The happiness he had long desired was about to dawn on him.\r\nIn a few months he would be the husband of that Aminta he had so much\r\nloved and so regretted. The Count was received almost as a son by the\r\nPrince, and as a husband by Aminta. Taddeo looked on him entirely as a\r\nbrother, and began to realize the happiest dream of his life--the\r\nmarriage he had so desired. Gladly availing himself of the liberty\r\naccorded him, of coming familiarly to the hotel of the Prince de\r\nMaulear, the Count was perfectly happy. He passed the whole day there,\r\nand when night came mingled most unwillingly with society. The order\r\nof expulsion which he had received, and which had been so mysteriously\r\nrevoked, added to the interest which had been entertained for him by\r\nall Paris. The opposition was especially attentive to him, for he was\r\nesteemed a decided enemy of the French Government, and of all\r\nmonarchies. This ostracism which he had escaped, attracted the\r\nattention to him, for which the people of Paris were already prepared,\r\nby the history of his Neapolitan adventures. In 1850 he would have\r\nbeen called the lion of the day, and the greatest curiosity would have\r\nbeen paid to all his adventures. So great was the attention excited by\r\nthe account of Monte-Leone's loss of fortune, that people were\r\nsurprised to see him resume his usual mode of life, keep possession of\r\nhis hotel, indulge in the same expenses of carriages, attendants, etc.\r\nHe altered nothing, not even the luxury of his house, from what had\r\nbeen its condition before the papers and he himself had announced that\r\nthe failure of Lamberti made him entirely poor, and forced him to sell\r\nhis diamonds and other personal property to be able to live, as\r\ncheaply as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Count, who had been forced to conceal the manner in which his\r\nproperty had been restored, told his friends, Taddeo, d'Harcourt and\r\nVon Apsberg, that certain important funds had been recovered from the\r\ngeneral wreck; and they, delighted with his good fortune, did not fail\r\nto congratulate him. The world was more curious; the enemies of the\r\nCount especially, who were ultra-monarchists, were numerous, active,\r\nand malicious. They wrote to Naples, and ascertained that the ruin of\r\nMonte-Leone was total, acquiring also certainty that he had no funds\r\nin any European bank, and no property. They therefore made an outcry\r\nof astonishment when they saw all the external appearance of opulence\r\nin the possession of one they knew without the means of so splendid\r\nand imposing an establishment. The Count knew nothing of this, and\r\ncontinued his old life. It is, all know, true that rumors of this kind\r\nreach their object last of all, when they are calculated to be\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nOne of the dominant ideas which actuated us in the preparation of this\r\nhistory, we can here dwell upon, and we ask leave to do so briefly.\r\nThere exists in French society, polished and elegant as it is, a\r\nhideous monster known to all, though no one disturbs it. Its ravages\r\nare great; almost incalculable. It saps reputations, poisons,\r\ndishonors, and defiles the splendor of the most estimable fame. This\r\nminotaurus, which devours so many innocent persons, is especially\r\nfearful, because its blows are terrible. It presents itself under the\r\nmildest and gentlest forms, and is received every where in the city.\r\nWe find it in our rooms, in the interior of our families, in the\r\npalaces of the opulent, and the garrets of the poor. It has no name,\r\nbeing a mere figure of speech, a very word. It is composed of but one\r\nphrase, and is called--THEY SAY. \"Do you know such a one?\" is often\r\nasked, and the person is pointed out.\r\n\r\n\"_No_; but they say his morals are very bad. He has had strange\r\nadventures, and his family is very unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I know nothing about it. But they say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"This young woman, so beautiful, so brilliant, so much admired--Do you\r\nknow her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. _They say_ that it is not difficult to please her, and that more\r\nthan one has done so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she appears so decent, so reserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; but _they say_----\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not trust that gentleman who has such credit and is thought so\r\nrich. Be on your guard--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! his fortune is immense: see what an establishment he has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! But _they say_ he is very much involved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the fact?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I. _They say_ though--\"\r\n\r\nThis _they say_ is heard in every relation of life. It is deadly\r\nmortal, and not to be grasped. It goes hither and thither, strikes and\r\nkills manly honor, female virtue, without either sex being ever\r\nconscious of the injury done. Each as he reads these lines will\r\nremember cases illustrating the truth of what we say. The Count\r\nsuffered from the influence of the evil we mention; and as all were\r\nignorant whence his fortune came, each one adopted a thousand\r\nconjectures and suspicions, which, as is always the case, were most\r\nmalicious. This is the way of the world. Now the consequences of this\r\n_they say_ are plain. By its means they had dared to attack a\r\nreputation which hitherto had been considered unassailable. This _they\r\nsay_ came in the end. The Marquise de Maulear was the only person who\r\nknew whence came the resources of Monte-Leone; and after he had\r\nconfided to her, the charming woman had said, \"It was very wrong in\r\nyou not to tell me previously of your good fortune. For instance, when\r\nI thought you a fugitive and ruined, I suffered you to read my heart.\r\nHad you told me this before, you would not have seen within it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not make me regret my misery which procured me such exquisite\r\npleasure as knowing that you loved me.\"\r\n\r\nIn the long and pleasant conversations of the Count and Marquise, he\r\nwas frequently embarrassed in relation to the duties imposed on him as\r\nchief of the _Carbonari_. Aminta never dared to speak to him in\r\nrelation to that subject, though she was more anxious about it. On\r\nthis point alone the Count was impenetrable, avoiding with care all\r\nthat related to his political plans, and giving the Marquise no\r\ninformation about them.\r\n\r\nOne day Aminta, the Prince de Maulear, the Countess of Grandmesnil,\r\nand Taddeo, were in the drawing-room. The Countess did not love the\r\nyoung Marquise, whom she looked on as the indirect cause of her\r\nnephew's death. Neither did she love the Count, whose attentions to\r\nAminta were by no means to her taste. The old lady was aware of\r\nMonte-Leone's opinions, and lost no opportunity to open all her\r\nbatteries on liberals, jacobins and foreigners, who sought to make\r\nFrance the receptacle of the trouble and contests of which it had\r\nalready drank so deeply. The Countess said--\r\n\r\n\"You know the news, brother?\" The Prince de Maulear was then playing a\r\ngame of chess with Monte-Leone. \"We have now, thank God and M. Angles,\r\none miserable Jacobin the less to deal with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Check to your king!\" said the Prince to Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said she, following out the tenor of her own thoughts,\r\n\"it would be check to the King, if the opinions of those persons were\r\nto triumph. M. Angles, however, watches over them and us.\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant the Count neglected his game. He as well as Taddeo\r\nheard what she had said, and both seemed anxious to hear her out.\r\n\r\n\"May I venture to inquire, Countess,\" said the Count, holding his\r\npiece in his hand, and hesitating to place it on the board, \"who is\r\nthe terrible Jacobin from whom the world is delivered?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the most dangerous alive, Count,\" said the old lady, with an\r\nair of triumph. \"The man, it is said, had his connections established\r\nthrough the whole army.\"\r\n\r\n\"Check to your king,\" said the Prince, who was weary of the delay.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said the Count, with visible abstraction; and he played his\r\ngame so badly that the Prince won it without difficulty. The latter\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Check-mate--victory--victory!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, brother,\" said the Countess, \"a great victory. For the Jacobin\r\nis a general. General B----, one of those vile Buonapartists, to whom,\r\nat a time like this, a regiment should never have been trusted.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count and Taddeo grew pale when they heard the General's name. He\r\nwas one of the seven chiefs of ventas at the house of Von Apsberg.\r\n\r\n\"Why was the General arrested?\" said the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, some plot. The Jacobins and Buonapartists are always at that\r\nbusiness. The details are not yet known. It is certain, however, that\r\nhe was arrested this morning at his hotel. I heard so at the Duchess\r\nde Feltre's, whom I visited to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" said the Prince; \"on the day before yesterday he gave a\r\nball. Were you not there, Count?\" said he to Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Count; \"I was one of the last to leave. It was then\r\ntwo o'clock in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"At noon his generalship was in the Conciergerie. A bad business for\r\nhim, for the government has decided to use the greatest severity\r\nagainst all conspirators. Happily, the police is very expert, and it\r\nis said of every three conspirators one is a spy. A thing very\r\nsatisfactory to society, but decidedly unfortunate for the plotters.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the Count, indignantly, \"that the conspirators are\r\ncalumniated. They are bound by such oaths, and are so devoted to their\r\nopinions, that there can be but few traitors among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Count,\" said the Prince, \"the spirit of Monte-Leone of Castle\r\ndel Uovo is yet visible, and you do not seem to have recovered from\r\nyour old disease. When you speak of conspirators you seem to defend\r\nyour friends. I hope, however, for your sake, and for the sake of\r\nthose who love you,\" said he, pointing to Aminta, \"that you have\r\nrenounced for ever your old enterprises. His Majesty, Louis XVIII.,\r\nthe other day spoke highly of you, relying much on your devotion, and\r\nhe cannot have to do with an ingrate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Taddeo, with stupefaction, as he looked at his associate,\r\n\"the King of France relies on the devotion of Monte-Leone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not why,\" said the Count, not a little moved by this _brevet_\r\nof royalism. \"I confess, though, that I shall be surprised to give any\r\nchagrin or uneasiness to my friends.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were in a manner wrung from the Count by the paleness and\r\nagitation of Aminta since the commencement of the conversation. This\r\nnew declaration increased Taddeo's surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said the Prince, \"there is pardon for every sin. We\r\nknow, and we look on you as a wandering sheep returned to the fold.\r\nSee, however, what are the consequences of a bad reputation. An\r\ninsurrection breaks out in Italy, and you are at once thought to be\r\nits accomplice in France. You are about to be expelled from the\r\ncountry and treated as an enemy, when we acquire a certainty. What do\r\nI say? when the King of France and his ministers swear by you alone!\"\r\n\r\nThis series of praises in relation to his royalty evidently increased\r\nthe bad humor of the Count, as well as the astonishment of Taddeo.\r\nMonte-Leone was about to reply, even though he destroyed his influence\r\nwith the Prince and Marquise. He was about to repel the fanciful\r\ncompliments to his loyalty, when the Countess of Grandmesnil folded up\r\nher work. This was the usual signal for dispersion, and all were about\r\nto leave, when the Marquise said to Monte-Leone, \"Count, will you\r\nremain here a few moments? I wish to speak to you of the charity in\r\nwhich you were kind enough to unite with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count went anxiously to Aminta's side.\r\n\r\nThe Prince said, with a smile, \"No one ever refuses to speak with a\r\npretty woman. That is even the weak side of our ministers. Talk,\r\nthen, with my daughter-in-law, and neither the Countess nor I will\r\ntrouble you.\" He then took the Countess's arm, and led her from the\r\nroom. Taddeo remained, for his interest with the Count was too grave\r\nto permit him to leave thus. Aminta said but a few words to\r\nMonte-Leone. The deep emotion of the young woman, however, gave them a\r\nserious character. \"Listen,\" said she. \"I do not know what is about to\r\nhappen, but your agitation, and that of Taddeo, when the Countess\r\nspoke of General B----, did not escape me. A painful presentiment\r\nassures me that you are involved in some secret plot, and that new\r\ndangers menace you. In the name of all that is dear to you, in the\r\nname of your love to me, I conjure you to abandon those ideas, or I\r\nshall die of terror and despair.\" She then, without speaking a word\r\nmore, kissed her brother, and retired. The Count stood as if he were\r\nstruck with a thunderbolt. Taddeo took his hand, and said, \"Come,\r\ncome,\" wresting the Count from the painful thoughts Aminta had called\r\nup. \"Come, the arrest of General B---- may ruin all.\" They entered\r\nMonte-Leone's carriage, and drove to the Duke d'Harcourt. They hoped\r\nto find the Vicomte, and take him to Matheus, for the opinion of each\r\nof the four was necessary in considering the best means of warding off\r\nthe peril which menaced the association. D'Harcourt was in, but\r\nMonte-Leone and Taddeo had not expected the spectacle which awaited\r\nthem. The Vicomte had one of those sudden attacks, forerunners of the\r\ncruel disease which had devastated his family. The pleasures of the\r\nwinter, in which the imprudent young man madly indulged, and perhaps\r\nalso the cares and anxieties of his political relations, the nocturnal\r\nventas he was often obliged to attend, had severely shaken his already\r\nfeeble health, and caused a cough, every utterance of which sounded to\r\nhis father like a funeral knell. The Count and Taddeo found him in\r\nbed. Von Apsberg was by his side, and opposite the doctor was the\r\ncharming Marie, glancing alternately from the doctor to the patient.\r\nThe Duke leaned on the fireplace, and gently scolded Rene for his\r\nfolly and imprudence. The arrival of the two friends produced a\r\ncessation to this, but the Duke continued: \"Come, gentlemen, and\r\nassist me to produce some effect on your friend; for, unassisted, even\r\nI cannot. Tell him that such an exposure of his life, in folly and\r\ndissipation, is a double crime, when his health is so dear to an old\r\nman who has no other son.\" Tears came into the Duke's eyes as he\r\nspoke, which Marie kissed away.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Rene,\" said she, \"you see how unhappy you make us all. Promise,\r\nthen, to be more reasonable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said Rene, giving the Duke his hand, \"I will promise you to\r\ndo the impossible thing, to be prudent. Besides, you have a powerful\r\nauxiliary in my friend Monte-Leone, who has committed not a few\r\nfollies in his time. He has however begun a new life, and will soon be\r\nentirely converted by Hymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What,\" said Marie, \"is the Count about to be married?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the Count, \"your brother is indiscreet, and you\r\ncan never take half that he says as literal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Marie, \"you are in love--that is about the half of his\r\nstatement.\" And Marie blushed.\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg said, as he remarked the embarrassment of the young girl,\r\n\"Our patient needs the warmth and mildness of the south. Magnetism\r\nwith the Vicomte will be powerless, and he must avoid cold and\r\ndampness. He must also be prudent, and that is the greatest\r\ndifficulty. I however rely on his promise and his devotion to us.\r\nAdieu, Messieurs,\" said he, bowing to Taddeo and Monte-Leone. \"Do not\r\nmake him talk, or suffer him to sit up too long.\" The Duke left,\r\naccompanied by Marie, whose last look seemed to recommend her brother\r\nto the doctor. Perhaps, though, this glance had another signification,\r\nfor the eyes of young women mean a great deal. As soon as the four\r\nassociates were alone, the Count told Matheus of the arrest.\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg thought: \"The General cannot be in danger. Only one\r\nevidence of his participation could have been found, and that\r\nMonte-Leone gave me on the day before yesterday. I am sure I placed it\r\nin the secret drawer of my laboratory, the key of which I alone keep.\"\r\n\r\n\"What proof do you mean?\" asked d'Harcourt, whose memory was troubled\r\nby illness.\r\n\r\n\"A proof,\" said Monte-Leone, \"which would be overwhelming in the case\r\nof the General and a number of our brethren--the roll of the venta\r\nover which he presides. This roll he has signed. He gave it to me at\r\ntwo in the morning of the day before yesterday, and I gave it to Von\r\nApsberg on the next day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it matters not. Though the General has been arrested, the\r\nmystery of ventas has not been penetrated. I am assured that skilful\r\nand incessant espionage hovers around us, and the time for action\r\nshould be no longer delayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the Count, to whom this idea recalled what the Marquise\r\nhad said, \"we should not raise a flag we cannot defend. The forces the\r\nGeneral controlled are indispensable to our success.\"\r\n\r\n\"To replace soldiers,\" said Von Apsberg, \"we shall have opinion on our\r\nside. Our various ventas will be valiant soldiers, and will be\r\nencouraged when they see themselves so much more numerous than they\r\nexpect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not let us be hasty,\" said Monte-Leone. \"The six chiefs of the\r\nprincipal ventas, like the brave General, must give me the lists of\r\nventas, and only when we are sure of their number will we act.\"\r\n\r\nHis three friends then adopted Monte-Leone's opinion, and they\r\nseparated, mutually recommending prudence to each other. There\r\nremained, however, a species of surprise, and an injurious impression\r\nin relation to Monte-Leone's hesitation. He had usually been the most\r\ndecided of the four.\r\n\r\nWhen Von Apsberg returned home, he went to his laboratory, and opened\r\nthe bureau in which the papers of the association were kept. He\r\nsatisfied himself that the lists of the various ventas were safe. He\r\nbreathed freely and slept soundly, without any trouble on account of\r\nthe arrest of the General. On the next day, however, a letter, hastily\r\nwritten with a pencil, was brought him by a man who at once\r\ndisappeared. It was from General A----, and was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The list of our associates, certified by myself, is in the possession\r\nof the prefect of police. I saw it myself, and I am ruined.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg uttered a cry of terror. He was utterly confounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THEY SAY.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of General A---- produced a double effect in Paris. The\r\ncity began to have confidence in the vigilant police, which sought for\r\nand arrested the enemies of order every where and in every rank, while\r\nthe chiefs of the great association of Carbonarism trembled when they\r\nsaw the government on the track of their plans and projects. They then\r\nasked on all sides what could have been the motive of the\r\nincarceration of the General, and how they had discovered the\r\ncriminal, or rather the criminals, for the principal associates of the\r\n_venta_ over which the General presided, were arrested after their\r\nchief. Still other arrests were subsequently made. Nothing, however,\r\ntranspired, either in relation to the offence of which the General was\r\naccused, or the secret means by which the police had acquired\r\ninformation of them. The police acted prudently and with great skill,\r\nfor the General and his associates were but a small part of an immense\r\nplot. Time and secret service alone would give the government a clue\r\nto follow all the secret labyrinths of this vast plot, which menaced\r\nFrance and Europe. A conspiracy and military plot was talked of, and\r\nthe trial of the affair was understood to be postponed until time\r\nshould throw more light on the matter. The authorities were not in a\r\nhurry, they needed other aims, and waited patiently to procure them.\r\nThus passed a month; and as in Paris every thing is soon forgotten,\r\npeople paid no attention to General A---- and his imprisonment. Public\r\nattention, however, was reattracted to this mysterious affair. The\r\nentertainments, concerts, and receptions of the court, made the city\r\njoyous. The gold of countless visitors from foreign nations gave\r\nactivity to commerce, and there was an universal spirit of rivalry in\r\nluxury and opulence. Then the Duchess de Berri gave those charming\r\nballs, of which those who were admitted even now talk of.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the note written to Von Apsberg by General A----, in\r\nwhich he assured him he had seen the list of the venta, he had himself\r\ncertified to in the hands of the prefect of police, remained\r\nimpenetrable to the supreme _venta_, for Von Apsberg had the list the\r\nCount had given him. The General was in close confinement, and no\r\nintercourse could be had with him. The six other chiefs of the ventas\r\nwere ignorant of this incident of the arrest of their confederate. The\r\nfour brothers of the central venta had resolved not to suffer the\r\ncircumstance to transpire, because the Count fancied this circumstance\r\nwould chill their zeal, and make them uneasy about the new lists. On\r\nthese lists, as we have said, the decision of the time of action was\r\nmade to depend, as it would reveal to the four chiefs the exact number\r\nof their confederates in Paris. According to the statutes of\r\ncarbonarism, the signatures of the brethren were sacred engagements,\r\nwhich made it indispensable for them to give their aid to the\r\nundertaking when the hour and day should be appointed. The lists were,\r\nthen, a kind of declaration of war against the government, in which\r\nthey must either conquer or die. This is the prudence of all bad\r\ncauses. Persons thus involved have no confidence that their associates\r\nwill keep their oaths, and put remorse and repentance out of the\r\nquestion by allowing no alternative between ruin and safety. The\r\nVicomte d'Harcourt, but slightly recovered from his indisposition,\r\nseldom left his father's house, and participated but slightly in the\r\npleasures of the season. Taddeo, whose devotion to the Neapolitan\r\nambassadress constantly increased, visited her every day, and went\r\nnowhere else. Though aware that she was constantly anxious to speak of\r\nthe Count, he did not despair of being able some day to touch her\r\nheart. So great were his attentions, that in society he was looked on\r\nas the _cicisbeo_ of the Duchess. The Duke of Palma, devoted to his\r\nopera-loves, seemed not at all offended at the frequent visits of\r\nTaddeo Rovero, whose attentions did not at all shock his Italian\r\nideas. Von Apsberg lived more retired than ever, and rarely left his\r\nlaboratory except when he went to the Duke d'Harcourt's. There the\r\nintelligent doctor was kindly received by all the family, Marie\r\nincluded, and his fair patient's health seemed visibly to improve, as\r\nthose flowers which have been too long neglected always do when\r\nattended to by a skilful horticulturist. Monte-Leone devoted to the\r\nsociety of Paris, of which he was passionately fond, all the hours\r\nwhich he passed away from the Marquise. This, however, was a duty, for\r\nthere only could he meet the Carbonari who belonged to the upper\r\nclass without giving rise to suspicion. The trial of General A---- was\r\nsoon to take place, and the preparations for it had already been\r\nbegun. Revelations or anxious inquiries might destroy the association.\r\nConcert was required to avoid this, and Count Monte-Leone gave this\r\ninformation to MM. C----, the lawyer B----, the baron de Ch----, the\r\nbanker F----, and the rich merchant Ober, who was perhaps from his\r\nextended commercial relations, the most important of the Carbonari.\r\n\r\nA great dinner was given by the banker F---- to enable the chiefs to\r\nconfer with Monte-Leone. But in addition to these personages, and in\r\norder that public attention should not be fixed on them alone, F----\r\nhad invited the _elite_ of the capital, several peers of France, some\r\nillustrious soldiers, many deputies, and several women famous for\r\ntheir rank and beauty. Insensibly conversation assumed a political\r\ntone, as at that time every thing did. Monte-Leone, whom the abuses of\r\nthe French government and the _camarilla_ of the Tuilleries made most\r\nindignant, gave vent to his opinions and complained bitterly of the\r\nacts of the ministry. He compassionated the people, whose liberties\r\nwere being swept away, and reprobated the censorship of the liberty of\r\nthe press and of freedom of speech--the only resource of the oppressed\r\nand the only means of reaching the oppressors. The master of the\r\nhouse, M. F----, agreed with the Count in the liberal opinions he had\r\nexpressed. Led on by the example, B---- and C---- testified their\r\nsympathy with what the Count had said, and their wish to see a change\r\nin the fortune of a country where the institutions satisfied neither\r\nthe wants nor the rights of the oppressed. This discussion, which had\r\nbeen provoked by the Count, was so bold and so decided that many of\r\nthe guests looked on with terror, fearing they would be compromised by\r\nthe expression of such revolutionary ideas. Just then many of the\r\nguests of M. F----, taking him aside from the table, asked anxiously\r\nif he was satisfied of the discretion of all the persons present, and\r\nalso of their honor. M. F---- energetically repelled such fears,\r\nsaying: \"The people whom I receive are not all friends of the\r\ngovernment. Nothing, however, said here will be repeated, for the\r\nminister of police has no representative at my table.\" The words of\r\ntheir host in a degree satisfied some of the most timid. It was then\r\nsaid openly that amid the most eminent persons met with in society\r\nwere found individuals in the secret pay of M. Angles, and that many\r\nruined and extravagant nobleman did not hesitate to exist in this\r\nmanner. People said that in the drawing-room of M. F---- Monte-Leone\r\nhad determined to defy the government, and they looked on his conduct\r\nunder existing circumstances as most imprudent.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening, and when all were engaged, the chiefs of _ventas_\r\ntook occasion, one by one, to isolate themselves from company and gave\r\nthe Count the rolls. It was then agreed, also, that the last of these\r\ndocuments being complete, notice should be given without delay, and\r\nduring the trial of the General, of the day for the commencement of\r\nthe insurrectionary movement by which Carbonarism was to be revealed\r\nto France and to Europe. The terrible plan, however, was foiled by\r\nvarious events which attacked the society unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nFour days after the dinner of M. F----, he, the lawyer B----, the\r\nbaron Ch----, who had taken so decided a part in the discussion\r\nprovoked by Monte-Leone, and who, on that very evening, had given him\r\nthe fatal lists of his associates, were arrested. The first was taken\r\nin his office, the second just as he left his cabinet, and the third\r\non his way to the opera. The capital was amazed at this news. All the\r\nother guests of F---- began to examine their consciences, and sought\r\nto recall whether or not they had given utterance to any governmental\r\nheresy at the fatal dinner, and whether they had not uttered something\r\nrash. They were doubtful if any opinion at all might not expose them\r\nto the resentment and vigilance of an adroit and secret police. It\r\nseemed beyond a doubt that the remarks of the persons who had been\r\narrested had provoked this rigorous action, and that some ear in the\r\npay of the police had heard their dangerous conversation, and noted\r\nthe violent expression of their opinions. The conduct of all the\r\nguests was then passed in review, and the public and private life of\r\neach examined. Their domestic history and life were inquired into, and\r\ntheir weak points, habits, errors, and tastes, were scrutinized.\r\n\r\nNo rank, family, sex, or social position, was neglected, and not even\r\nintrigues, life, nor money, were considered sufficient to shield the\r\ninformer. All were anxious to tear away the mask from the common\r\nenemy, to crush the serpent, who, sliding stealthily into society,\r\ngnawed its very heart and lacerated that bosom which sheltered it.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of General A---- then recurred to the memory of all. This\r\nevent had taken place after a ball which the General had given. It was\r\nafter an entertainment given by F---- that he, too, had lost his\r\nliberty. On this occasion two other important men had shared the fate\r\nof the rich banker, and, like him, they had both been energetic,\r\nviolent, and pitiless denouncers of a ministry which defied public\r\nopinion and outraged the nation. People then remembered that Count\r\nMonte-Leone had provoked the conversation--that he had gone farther\r\nthan any one else on the dangerous ground--and that his daring had\r\nsurpassed that of the master of the house and his guests. All expected\r\nhe would be arrested also. This fear was especially well founded, as\r\nMonte-Leone concealed neither his liberal opinions nor his\r\nrevolutionary doctrines, and in fact every thing in his previous\r\nconduct pointed him out as one of the persons to whom the attention of\r\nthe police would especially be directed. People were, therefore,\r\namazed to see Monte-Leone preserve his liberty, and that one of the\r\nfour speakers who had been most imprudent enjoyed entire impunity.\r\nAstonishment, however, was not all, for strange reports were soon\r\ncirculated, and rumors were heard in every direction. The impunity of\r\nthe Count became the universal subject of conversation. His private\r\nlife was taken in hand, and his whole career, as it were, extended on\r\nthe anatomical table of moral anatomy. The scalpel of public opinion,\r\nit is well known, pitilessly dissects every subject it wishes\r\nthoroughly to understand. The THEY SAY, that terrible creature to\r\nwhich we have already referred, began to play its part. It was heard\r\nevery where. \"THEY SAY Count Monte-Leone cannot be a stranger to what\r\nis passing. He was seen to talk to General A---- on the night of the\r\nball for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Count Monte-Leone?--a man of his rank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, these Italian noblemen are all suspicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"He--a liberal--a revolutionist!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me. People often change their opinions in this world,\r\nespecially when fortune disappears, and want of money and care\r\nsupervene. _They say_ he is completely ruined, yet he is still very\r\nluxurious in his mode of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"True--that is strange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, not at all. _They say_ the strong box of the police enables\r\nhim to maintain his style.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"_They say_, also, that the order to leave France given by the\r\nminister was but a trick to divert suspicion and keep him here\r\nusefully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so? Then he is a villain, and should be avoided. He is\r\na----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know nothing of it--but _they say_ so.\"\r\n\r\n_They_ did say so, but when that awful rumor was first pronounced\r\n_they_ did not. These words were produced by the terror which the\r\nevents of the day produced on the mind of every friend, even of the\r\nthree imprisoned Carbonari. Perhaps some malevolent spirit\r\ndisseminated them. This rumor was circulated from house to house, like\r\na drop of oil, which though first scarcely perceptible, sullies the\r\nfairest fabrics utterly. A trifling fault is thus made to do the part\r\nof an atrocious crime. At first the rumor was whispered. It then grew\r\nbolder, and finally fortified itself by a thousand corroborations\r\nfurnished by chance or gossip. Every person who detailed it added to\r\nits incidents and arguments. Within one month after the dinner all\r\nParis heard of the terrible offence against society attributed to\r\nCount Monte-Leone. As is always the case, however, the three friends\r\nof the Count were the last to hear of this slander. Every one who was\r\naware of their intimacy took care not to speak to them of the rumor,\r\nfor no one wished to involve himself by repeating a story entirely\r\nunsubstantiated, and the origin of which was unknown. The consequence\r\nwas that the three persons who could have refuted the calumny were\r\nentirely ignorant of the stigma attached to their friend. Monte-Leone\r\nhad no more suspicion than his friends had in relation to the horrible\r\nfable.\r\n\r\nThe other chiefs of the principal ventas, who might have told him what\r\nwas said, terrified at the fate of their associates, lived apart,\r\nrefused to see any one, and thus heard none of the imputations against\r\nthe high-priest of Carbonarism. Then commenced a series of mistakes,\r\nsurprises, and mortifications, in which Monte-Leone would see no\r\ninsult. His life, however, became an enigma, the explanation of which\r\nhe could not divine. Certain rooms under various pretexts were closed\r\nto him. Often persons who once had been most anxious to secure his\r\nattendance at their entertainments pretended to forget him. The world\r\ndid not dare, however, to brave an enemy whose secret power it was\r\nignorant of, but it exhibited a certain coldness and oblivion which\r\ndeeply wounded him. His most intimate acquaintances avoided him with\r\nstudied care, and when they accepted his hand did so with a marked\r\nexpression of annoyance. An immense void existed around him. His hotel\r\nwas a solitude, and the houses of others were shut to him. The Count\r\nat first thought he found a motive for this in the apprehension all\r\nentertained of his affiliation with some secret association. When he\r\nsaw that the police paid no attention to him, he was compelled to seek\r\nsome other reason for his public proscription. What this cause was he\r\ndid not divine and could not ask, for a position of this kind is such\r\nthat an honorable man thinks it beneath him to ask for an explanation\r\nof merely natural occurrences. Wounded, disgusted, and grieved by the\r\nstrange existence created for him, Monte-Leone felt himself at once a\r\nprey to the distrust which ostracism of this kind creates in the bosom\r\nof all who are subject to it. The world thought that by avoiding\r\nsociety Count Monte-Leone confessed the justice of its allegations. He\r\nbecame every day more attentive to the charming woman he adored, and\r\nwho only waited the time when the proprieties of society would permit\r\nher to make him her husband. In her affection he found a consolation\r\nfor all the external chagrin which annoyed him, for a mute terror had\r\ntaken possession of the Carbonari since the occurrence of the many\r\narrests, the motives of which were as yet wrapped in such impenetrable\r\nmystery. An event which was altogether unexpected made his position\r\nyet more complicated. He was one evening in one of the few houses to\r\nwhich he was yet invited. This was the house of M. L----, where the\r\nMarquis de Maulear had lost such immense sums to the Englishman who\r\nsubsequently ruined him. M. L----, either more prudent or circumspect\r\nthan others, had not listened to the reports which were circulated\r\nabout Monte-Leone, and had invited him to his magnificent hotel in the\r\nRue d'Antin.\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone had avoided the crowd, and walked down the long avenue of\r\nexotic flowers and camelias, then almost unknown in Paris. He came\r\nupon a boudoir where several men were speaking. The Count was about to\r\ngo back, when his name struck on his ear. \"Yes, gentlemen,\" said one\r\nof the speakers, in a most indignant tone, \"you may well be astonished\r\nat my presence here, while my family is in tears, and my prospects\r\nblasted and made desperate. Only eight days since I came to Paris, and\r\nam here to find Count Monte-Leone, my challenge to whom, to deliver\r\nwhich I have sought him every where, should be as solemn as the\r\nvengeance I will exact.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Count heard these words than he rushed into the\r\nboudoir, and stood face to face with the speaker, who was a young man\r\nof twenty-eight or thirty, wearing the uniform of the royal navy. His\r\ncountenance was mild and noble, but bore an expression of perfect fury\r\nwhen he saw Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the Count, \"you will not have to look farther for the\r\nperson of whom you have dared to speak thus. I am thankful that I am\r\nhere to spare you farther trouble in looking for me, though why you do\r\nso I cannot conceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was listening to us,\" said the young man to his friends, in a tone\r\nof the deepest contempt. \"Well, after all, that is right enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chance,\" said the Count, resuming his _sang-froid_ and control over\r\nhimself, which he always maintained in such emergencies, \"led me\r\nwithin sound of your voice. You and I also should be glad that this is\r\nthe case, for it seems to me a ball is a bad place for such an\r\nexplanation as you seem to wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"All places are good,\" said the naval officer, in a most insolent\r\ntone, \"to tell you what I think of you. To repeat to you the epithet\r\nyou have overheard, and which I am willing yet again to declare to all\r\nin these rooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Monte-Leone, with the same calmness, \"will you tell me\r\nfirst to whom I speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is A----, and I am a lieutenant of the royal navy. My father\r\nis the person whom your infamous denunciations have caused to be\r\nimprisoned in the Conciergerie!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the Count, \"are you the son of General A----?\"\r\n\r\n\"What influences me I cannot and will not tell you; for then it would\r\nbe out of the question for me to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the Count, speaking to those who witnessed this\r\nscene, to which the attention of many others had now been called,\r\n\"this young man is mad. I, more than any person, have pitied his\r\nfather, and I wish to give General A---- a new proof of my sympathy,\r\nby granting his son a delay until to-morrow, to enable him to repair\r\nthe incredible injury he has done me. Here is my card,\" said he,\r\nplacing it on a table, \"and I shall wait until to-morrow for an\r\nexplanation of the unintelligible conduct of Lieutenant A----.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Count had finished he left the boudoir, and the\r\nLieutenant's friends kept possession of him, taking him out of the\r\nhotel. On the next day Monte-Leone received the following note:\r\n\r\n\"COUNT--Instead of making an apology to you, I maintain all I said.\r\nYou are a coward and a scoundrel, and you know why. I repeat, that if\r\nmy voice articulated or my hand traced, why I speak thus, it would be\r\nimpossible for me to kill you and avenge myself. Do not therefore ask\r\nme to make an explanation of what you know perfectly well. If you are\r\nunmoved by what I now say, and if I do not bring you out, I will have\r\nrecourse to other means. I will await you and your witnesses to-day at\r\ntwo o'clock, at the _bois de Bologne_, behind Longchamp. I have\r\nselected this hour in order that I might previously see my father.\r\n\r\n\"GUSTAVE A----,\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant, Royal Navy.\"\r\n\r\n\"All hell is let loose against me,\" said the Count, as he perused this\r\nletter. \"Why can I not penetrate the awful mystery which enshrouds\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nTaking a pen, he wrote the following words, which he gave to the\r\nbearer of the challenge:\r\n\r\n\"I will be at the _bois de Bologne_ at two o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Entered according to the Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by Stringer\r\n& Townsend, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United\r\nStates for the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\nContinued from page 54.\r\n\r\n[8] _Anglice._ Only the first step is troublesome.--TR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nPOULAILLER, THE ROBBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCartouche had been arrested, tried, condemned, and executed, some\r\nseven or eight years, and no longer occupied the attention of the good\r\npeople of Paris, to whom his almost melodramatic life and death had\r\nafforded a most interesting and enduring topic. They were languishing,\r\nlike the Athenians of old, for something new, when there arose a rumor\r\nthat another robber, more dexterous, more audacious, more\r\nextraordinary, ay, and more cruel than Cartouche, was roaming about\r\nthe streets of their city. What was his name? whence did he come? were\r\nquestions in the mouth of every one, as each of his numerous daring\r\nacts was made public,--questions which no one could answer.\r\n\r\nIn vain was every arm of the police put in requisition--crime after\r\ncrime was committed with impunity, and terror reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nAt last the criminal himself disdained concealment, and all\r\nParis--nay, a considerable portion of Europe--trembled at the name of\r\nPOULAILLER.\r\n\r\nHe appeared about the year 1730, and astonished the world by deeds,\r\nsome of them so shocking, and at the same time so wonderful, that they\r\ngave some color to the belief of many that he was aided by\r\nsupernatural agency.\r\n\r\nThis belief was supported by a history of the circumstances attending\r\nhis birth.\r\n\r\nThere lived in a village on the coast of Brittany a man, poor but of\r\ngood repute, and well beloved by his neighbors,--an intrepid mariner,\r\nbut poor as Job himself when his friends came to comfort him. A robust\r\nand well-knit frame, combined with a fine frank countenance, well\r\nbronzed by the sea-breezes, was looked on favorably by all, and by\r\nnone more than by the young lasses whose furtive glances rested with\r\npleasure on the manly form and gallant bearing of Jacques Poulailler.\r\n\r\nHis strength was prodigious, and his temerity upon the ocean\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\nSuch qualities are appreciated in every country; and among the\r\nbeauties of the village, one remarkable for her superiority in wealth,\r\nas well as natural gifts, was attracted by them, and Jacques\r\nPoulailler had the good fortune to find favor in the eyes of her who\r\nwas known in her little world as _La belle Isabeau Colomblet_.\r\n\r\nAt no great distance from this maritime village, on the crest of a\r\nrock lashed by the waves, which at high tides was perfectly insulated,\r\ndwelt a personage of whose origin every one was ignorant. The building\r\nwhere he had established himself had long been of evil fame throughout\r\nthe country, and was only known as _La Tour Maudite_. The firesides\r\nresounded with tales of terror enacted in this lonely and ominous\r\ntheatre. Fiends, in the olden time had made it their abode, as was\r\ncurrently reported and believed. From that time, it was asserted that\r\nno human being could dwell there without having previously entered\r\ninto a compact with the evil one. The isolation of the place, the\r\ncontinued agitation of the waves at its base, the howlings of the wind\r\naround its frowning battlements, the traces of the thunderbolts that\r\nfrom time to time had blackened and almost charred its walls, the\r\nabsence of bush or tree, or any thing in the shape of blossom or\r\nverdure--for neither wall-flower nor even moss would grow there--had\r\nproduced their effect on the superstitious spirit of the neighbors,\r\nand the accursed place had remained untenanted by any thing earthly\r\nfor forty or fifty years.\r\n\r\nOne gloomy day, however, a man was seen prowling about the vicinity.\r\nHe came and went over the sands, and, just as a storm was rising, he\r\nthrew himself into a boat, gained the offing, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nEvery one believed that he was lost; but next morning there he was.\r\nSurprised at this, the neighbors began to inquire who he could be; and\r\nat last learned that he had bought the tower of the proprietor, and\r\nhad come to dwell there. This was all the information that their\r\nrestless curiosity could obtain. Whence did he come, and what had he\r\ndone? In vain were these questions asked. All were querists, and none\r\nfound a respondent. Two or three years elapsed before his name\r\ntranspired. At last it was discovered, nobody knew how, that his name\r\nwas Roussart.\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be a man above six feet in height, strongly built, and\r\napparently about thirty years of age. His countenance was all but\r\nhandsome, and very expressive. His conduct was orderly, and without\r\nreproach, and, proving himself to be an experienced fisherman, he\r\nbecame of importance in that country.\r\n\r\nNo one was more weatherwise than Roussart, and no one turned his\r\nforeknowledge to such good account. He had been seen frequently to\r\nkeep the sea in such fearful tempests, that all agreed that he must\r\nhave been food for fishes if he had not entered into some agreement\r\nwith Satan. When the stoutest hearts quailed, and ordinary men\r\nconsidered it suicidal to venture out, Roussart was to be seen braving\r\nthe tumult of winds and waves, and always returned to the harbor safe\r\nand sound.\r\n\r\nPeople began to talk about this, and shook their heads ominously.\r\nLittle cared Roussart for their words or gestures; but he was the only\r\none in the commune who never went to church. The cure at last gave out\r\nthat he was excommunicated; and from that time his neighbors broke off\r\nall communication with him.\r\n\r\nThings had arrived at this point, when it was rumored that the gallant\r\nfisherman, Jacques Poulailler, had touched the heart of _La belle\r\nIsabeau_. Soon their approaching marriage became the topic of the\r\nvillage; and, finally, one Sunday, after mass, the bans were first\r\npublished by the vicar. The lads of the village, congregated on the\r\nshore, were congratulating Poulailler on the auspicious event, when\r\nRoussart suddenly appeared among them.\r\n\r\nHis presence was a surprise. He had always avoided the village\r\nmeetings as much as others had sought them; and this sudden change in\r\nhis habits gave a new impulse to curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe stranger appeared to seek some one with his eyes, and presently\r\nwalked straight up to the happy Jacques, who, intoxicated with joy,\r\nwas giving and receiving innumerable shakes of the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Master Poulailler,\" said Roussart, \"you are going to be married,\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems sure,\" replied Poulailler.\r\n\r\n\"Not more sure than that your first-born will belong to the evil one.\r\nI, Roussart, tell you so.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he turned on his heel, and regained his isolated dwelling,\r\nleaving his auditors amazed by his abrupt and extraordinary\r\nannouncement, and poor Jacques more affected by it than any one else.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment Roussart showed himself no more in the neighborhood,\r\nand soon disappeared altogether, without leaving a trace to indicate\r\nwhat had become of him.\r\n\r\nMost country people are superstitious,--the Bretons eminently so, and\r\nJacques Poulailler never forgot the sinister prophecy of Roussart. His\r\ncomrades were not more oblivious; and when, a year after his marriage,\r\nhis first-born came into the world, a universal cry saluted the infant\r\nboy as devoted to Satan. _Donne au diable_ were the words added to the\r\nchild's name whenever it was mentioned. It is not recorded whether or\r\nno he was born with teeth, but the gossips remarked that during the\r\nceremony of baptism the new-born babe gave vent to the most fearful\r\nhowlings. He writhed, he kicked, his little face exhibited the most\r\nhorrible contortions; but as soon as they carried him out of the\r\nchurch, he burst out into laughter as unearthly as it was unnatural.\r\n\r\nAfter these evil omens every body expected that the little Pierre\r\nPoulailler would be ugly and ill-formed. Not a bit of it--on the\r\ncontrary, he was comely, active, and bold. His fine fresh complexion\r\nand well-furnished mouth were set off by his brilliant black eyes and\r\nhair, which curled naturally all over his head. But he was a sad\r\nrogue, and something more. If an oyster-bed, a warren, or an orchard\r\nwas robbed, Pierre Poulailler was sure to be the boy accused. In vain\r\ndid his father do all that parent could to reform him--he was\r\nincorrigible.\r\n\r\nMonsieur le cure had some difficulty to bring him to his first\r\ncommunion. The master of the village exhausted his catalogue of\r\ncorrections--and the catalogue was not very short--without succeeding\r\nin inculcating the first notions of the Christian faith and the\r\ndoctrine of the cross. \"What is the good of it?\" would the urchin say.\r\n\"Am not I devoted to the devil, and will not that be sufficient to\r\nmake my way?\"\r\n\r\nAt ten years of age Pierre was put on board a merchant-ship, as\r\ncabin-boy. At twelve he robbed his captain, and escaped to England\r\nwith the spoil. In London he contrived to pass for the natural son of\r\na French Duke; but his numerous frauds forced him again to seek his\r\nnative land, where, in his sixteenth year, he enlisted as a drummer in\r\nthe regiment of Champagne, commanded by the Count de Varicleres.\r\nBefore he had completed his eighteenth year he deserted, joined a\r\ntroop of fortune-telling gipsies, whom he left to try his fortune with\r\na regular pilferer, and finally, engaged himself to a rope-dancer. He\r\nplayed comedy, sold orvietan with the success of Doctor Dulcamara\r\nhimself, and in a word, passed through all the degrees which lead to\r\ndownright robbery.\r\n\r\nOnce his good angel seemed to prevail. He left his disreputable\r\ncompanions and entered the army honorably. For a short time there were\r\nhopes of him; it was thought that he would amend his life, and his\r\nsuperiors were satisfied with his conduct. But the choicest weapon in\r\nthe armory of him to whom he had been devoted was directed against\r\nhim. A _vivandiere_--the prettiest and most piquante of her\r\ntribe--raised a flame in his heart that burnt away all other\r\nconsiderations; but he might still have continued in a comparatively\r\nrespectable course, if the sergeant-major had not stood forward as his\r\nrival. The coquette had in her heart a preference for Pierre; and the\r\nsergeant, taking advantage of his rank, insulted his subordinate so\r\ngrossly that he was repaid by a blow. The sergeant's blood was up, and\r\nas he rushed to attack Pierre, the soldier, drawing his sabre,\r\ndangerously wounded his superior officer, who, after lingering a few\r\ndays, went the way of all flesh. Pierre would have tasted the tender\r\nmercies of the provost-marshal; but fortunately the regiment was lying\r\nnear the frontier, which our hero contrived to cross, and then\r\ndeclared war against society at large.\r\n\r\nThe varied knowledge and acquirements of the youth--his courage, true\r\nas steel, and always equal to the occasion--the prudence and foresight\r\nwith which he meditated a _coup de main_--the inconceivable rapidity\r\nof his execution--his delicate and disinterested conduct towards his\r\ncomrades--all contributed to render him famous, in the _famosus_\r\nsense, if you will, and to raise him to the first place.\r\n\r\nGermany was the scene of his first exploits. The world had condemned\r\nhim to death, and he condemned the world to subscribe to his living.\r\n\r\nAt this period, he had posted himself in ambush on the crest of a\r\nhill, whence his eye could command a great extent of country; and\r\ncertainly the elegance of his mien, his graceful bearing, and the\r\nsplendor of his arms, might well excuse those who did not take him for\r\nwhat he really was. He was on the hillside when two beautiful young\r\nwomen appeared in sight. He lost no time in joining them; and, as\r\nyouth is communicative, soon learnt, in answer to his questions, that,\r\ntired of remaining in the carriage, they had determined to ascend the\r\nhill on foot.\r\n\r\n\"You are before the carriage, then, mademoiselle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; cannot you hear the whip of the postillions?\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation soon became animated, and every moment made a deeper\r\ninroad into the heart of our handsome brigand: but every moment also\r\nmade the situation more critical. On the other side of the hill was\r\nthe whole band, ranged in order of battle, and ready to pounce upon\r\nthe travellers. Having ascertained the place of abode of his fair\r\ncompanions, and promised to avail himself of the first opportunity to\r\npay his compliments to them there, he bade them politely adieu; and\r\nhaving gained a path cut through the living rock, known but to few,\r\ndescended with the agility of a chamois to his party, whom he implored\r\nnot to attack the carriage which was approaching.\r\n\r\nBut, if Poulailler had his reasons for this chivalrous conduct, his\r\nband were actuated by no such motives, and they demurred to his\r\nprayer. He at once conquered their hesitation by bidding them name the\r\nvalue that they put on their expected booty, purchased the safety of\r\nthe travellers by the sum named, and the two fair daughters of the\r\nBaron von Kirbergen went on their way full of the praises of the\r\nhandsome stranger whose acquaintance they had made, and in blissful\r\nignorance of the peril they had passed.\r\n\r\nThat very day, Poulailler left his lieutenant in the temporary command\r\nof the band, mounted his most beautiful horse, followed his beloved to\r\nthe castle of her father, and introduced himself as the Count Petrucci\r\nof Sienna, whom he had lately robbed, and whose papers he had taken\r\ncare to retain with an eye to future business.\r\n\r\nHis assumed name, backed by his credentials, secured for him a\r\nfavorable reception, and he well knew how to improve the occasion. An\r\naccomplished rider, and bold in the chase, he won the good opinion of\r\nthe Baron; while his musical and conversational talent made him the\r\npet of the drawing-room. The young and charming Wilhelmina surrendered\r\nher heart to the gay and amiable cavalier; and all went merrily, till\r\none fine morning Fortune, whose wheel is never stationary, sent the\r\ntrue count to the castle. It was no case of the two Sosias, for no two\r\npersons could well be more unlike; and as soon as the real personage\r\nsaw his representative, he recognized him as the robber who had stolen\r\nhis purse as well as his name.\r\n\r\nHere was a pretty business. Most adventurers would have thrown up the\r\ngame as desperate; but our hero, with a front worthy of Fathom\r\nhimself, boldly proclaimed the last visitor to be an impostor, and\r\nargued the case so ably, and with such well-simulated indignation at\r\nthe audacity of the newcomer, that the Baron was staggered, and\r\ndespatched messengers to the partners of a mercantile house at\r\nFlorence, to whom the true Petrucci was well known.\r\n\r\nTo wait for the result of the inquiry would have been a folly of which\r\nPoulailler was not likely to be guilty; so he made a moonlight\r\nflitting of it that very night--but not alone. Poor Wilhelmina had\r\ncast in her lot with her lover for good or for evil, and fled with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe confusion that reigned in the best of all possible castles, the\r\nnext morning, may be conceived; but we must leave the Baron\r\nblaspheming, and the Baroness in hysterics, to follow the fugitives,\r\nwho gained France in safety, and were soon lost in the labyrinths of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThere he was soon joined by his band, to the great loss and terror of\r\nthe honest people of the good city. Every day, M. Herault, the\r\nlieutenant of police, was saluted by new cases of robbery and\r\nviolence, which his ablest officers could neither prevent nor punish.\r\nThe organization of the band was so complete, and the head so ably\r\ndirected the hands, that neither life nor property was considered safe\r\nfrom one moment to another. Nor were accounts of the generosity of the\r\nchief occasionally wanting to add to his fame.\r\n\r\nOne night, as Poulailler was traversing the roofs with the agility of\r\na cat, for the purpose of entering a house whose usual inmates were\r\ngone into the country, he passed the window of a garret whence issued\r\na melancholy concert of sobs and moans. He stopped, and approached the\r\napartment of a helpless family, without resources, without bread, and\r\nsuffering the pangs of hunger. Touched by their distress, and\r\nremembering his own similar sufferings before Fortune favored him, he\r\nwas about to throw his purse among them, when the door of the chamber\r\nopened violently, and a man, apparently beside himself, rushed in with\r\na handful of gold, which he cast upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" cried he, in a voice broken by emotion, \"there,\r\ntake--buy--eat; but it will cost you dear. I pay for it with my honor\r\nand peace of mind. Baffled in all my attempts to procure food for you\r\nhonestly, I was on my despairing return, when I beheld, at a short\r\ndistance from me, a tall but slight-made man, who walked hurriedly,\r\nbut yet with an air as if he expected some one. Ah! thought I, this is\r\nsome lover; and yielding to the temptation of the fiend, I seized him\r\nby the collar. The poor creature was terrified, and, begging for\r\nmercy, put into my hands this watch, two gold snuff-boxes, and those\r\nLouis, and fled. There they are; they will cost me my life. I shall\r\nnever survive this infamy.\"\r\n\r\nThe starving wife re-echoed these sentiments; and even the hungry\r\nchildren joined in the lamentations of the miserable father.\r\n\r\nAll this touched Pierre to the quick. To the great terror of the\r\nfamily, he entered the room, and stood in the midst.\r\n\r\n\"Be comforted,\" said he to the astonished husband; \"you have robbed a\r\nrobber. The infamous coward who gave up to you this plunder is one of\r\nPoulailler's sentinels. Keep it; it is yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who are you?\" cried the husband and wife;--\"who are you, and by\r\nwhat right is it that you thus dispose of the goods of another?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the right of a chief over his subalterns. I am Poulailler.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor family fell on their knees, and asked what they could do for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Give me a light,\" said Pierre, \"that I may get down into the street\r\nwithout breaking my neck.\"\r\n\r\nThis reminds one of the answer which Rousseau gave to the Duc de\r\nPraslin, whose Danish dog, as it was running before the carriage, had\r\nupset the peripatetic philosopher.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you?\" said the Duke to the fallen author of _La\r\nNouvelle Heloise_, whose person he did not know.\r\n\r\n\"You can tie up your dog,\" replied Jean-Jacques, gathering himself up,\r\nand walking away.\r\n\r\nPoulailler having done his best to render a worthy family happy, went\r\nhis way, to inflict condign punishment on the poltroon who had so\r\nreadily given up the purse and the watches.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of this accomplished robber were so numerous and\r\nmarvellous, that it is rather difficult to make a selection. One\r\nevening, at the _bal de l'Opera_, he made the acquaintance of a\r\ncharming woman, who, at first, all indignation, was at length induced\r\nto listen to his proposal, that he should see her home; and promised\r\nto admit him, \"if Monseigneur should not be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who is this Monseigneur?\" inquired Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask,\" replied the fair lady.\r\n\r\n\"Who is he, fairest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how curious you are; you make me tell all my secrets. If you\r\nmust know, he is a prince of the church, out of whose revenues he\r\nsupports me; and I cannot but show my gratitude to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not; he seems to have claims which ought to be attended\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time they had arrived at an elegantly furnished house, which\r\nthey entered, the lady having ascertained that the coast was clear;\r\nand Poulailler had just installed himself, when up drove a\r\ncarriage--Monseigneur in person.\r\n\r\nThe beauty, in a state of distraction, threw herself at the feet of\r\nher spark, and implored him to pass into a back cabinet. Poulailler\r\nobeyed, and had hardly reached his hiding-place, when he beheld,\r\nthrough the glazed door, Monseigneur, who had gone to his Semele in\r\nall his apostolical magnificence. A large and splendid cross of\r\ndiamonds, perfect in water, shot dazzling rays from his breast, where\r\nit was suspended by a chain of cat's-eyes, of great price, set in\r\ngold; the button and loop of his hat blazed with other precious\r\nstones; and his fingers sparkled with rings, whose brilliants were\r\neven greater and more beautiful than those that formed the\r\nconstellation of his cross.\r\n\r\nIt is very seldom that the human heart, however capacious, has room\r\nfor two grand passions in activity at the same time. In this instance,\r\nPoulailler no sooner beheld the rich and tempting sight, than he found\r\nthat the god of Love was shaking his wings and flying from his bosom,\r\nand that the demon of Cupidity was taking the place of the more\r\ndisinterested deity. He rushed from his hiding-place, and presented\r\nhimself to the astonished prelate with a poinard in one hand and a\r\npistol in the other, both of which he held to the sacred breast in the\r\npresence of the distracted lady. The bishop had not learnt to be\r\ncareless of life, and had sufficient self-possession in his terror not\r\nto move, lest he should compromise his safety, while Poulailler\r\nproceeded to strip him with a dexterity that practice had rendered\r\nperfect. Diamonds, precious stones, gold, coined and ornamental,\r\nrings, watch, snuff-box, and purse, were transferred from the priest\r\nto the robber with marvellous celerity; then turning to the lady, he\r\nmade her open the casket which contained the price of her favors, and\r\nleft the house with the plunder and such a laugh as those only revel\r\nin who win.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant of police began to take the tremendous success of our\r\nhero to heart, and in his despair at the increasing audacity of the\r\nrobber, caused it to be spread amongst his spies, archers, and\r\nsergeants, that he who should bring Poulailler before him should be\r\nrewarded with one hundred pistoles, in addition to a place of two\r\nthousand livres a year.\r\n\r\nM. Herault was seated comfortably at his breakfast, when the Count de\r\nVilleneuve was announced. This name was--perhaps is--principally borne\r\nby two celebrated families of Provence and Languedoc. M. Herault\r\ninstantly rose and passed into his cabinet, where he beheld a\r\npersonage of good mien, dressed to perfection, with as much luxury as\r\ntaste, who in the best manner requested a private interview. Orders\r\nwere immediately issued that no one should venture to approach till\r\nthe bell was rung; and a valet was placed as sentinel in an adjoining\r\ngallery to prevent the possibility of interruption.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Monsieur le Comte, what is your business with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a trifle;--merely a thousand pistoles, which I am about to take\r\nmyself from your strong box, in lieu of the one hundred pistoles, and\r\nthe snug place, which you have promised to him who would gratify you\r\nby Poulailler's presence. I am Poulailler, who will dispatch you to\r\nthe police of the other world with this poisoned dagger, if you raise\r\nyour voice or attempt to defend yourself. Nay, stir not--a scratch is\r\nmortal.\"\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of this address, the audacious personage drew\r\nfrom his pocket some fine but strong whip-cord, well hackled and\r\ntwisted, and proceeded to bind the lieutenant of police hand and foot,\r\nfinishing by making him fast to the lock of the door. Then the robber\r\nproceeded to open the lieutenant's secretaire, the drawers of which he\r\nwell rummaged, and having filled his pockets with the gold which he\r\nfound there, turned to the discomfited lieutenant with a profound bow,\r\nand after a request that he would not take the trouble to show him\r\nout, quietly took his departure.\r\n\r\nThere are some situations so confounding, that they paralyze the\r\nfaculties for a time; and the magistrate was so overcome by his\r\nmisfortune, that, instead of calling for aid, as he might have done\r\nwhen the robber left him, he set to work with his teeth, in vain\r\nendeavors to disengage himself from the bonds which held him fast. An\r\nhour elapsed before any one ventured to disturb M. Herault, who was\r\nfound in a rage to be imagined, but not described, at this daring act.\r\nThe loss was the least part of the annoyance. A cloud of epigrams flew\r\nabout, and the streets resounded with the songs celebrating\r\nPoulailler's triumph and the defeat of the unfortunate magistrate, who\r\ndared not for some time to go into society, where he was sure to find\r\na laugh at his expense.\r\n\r\nBut ready as the good people of Paris were with their ridicule, _they_\r\nwere by no means at their ease. The depredations of Poulailler\r\nincreased with his audacity, and people were afraid to venture into\r\nthe streets after nightfall. As soon as the last rays of the setting\r\nsun fell on the Boulevards, the busy crowds began to depart; and when\r\nthat day-star sank below the horizon, they were deserted. Nobody felt\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nThe Hotel de Brienne was guarded like a fortress, but difficulty\r\nseemed to give additional zest to Poulailler. Into this hotel he was\r\ndetermined to penetrate, and into it he got. While the carriage of the\r\nPrincess of Lorraine was waiting at the Opera, he contrived to fix\r\nleathern bands, with screws, under the outside of the bottom of the\r\nbody, while his associates were treating the coachman and footman at a\r\n_cabaret_, slipped under the carriage in the confusion of the\r\nsurrounding crowd when it drew up to the door of the theatre, and,\r\ndepending on the strength of his powerful wrists, held on underneath,\r\nand was carried into the hotel under the very nose of the Swiss\r\nCerberus.\r\n\r\nWhen the stable-servants were all safe in their beds, Poulailler\r\nquitted his painful hiding-place, where the power of his muscles and\r\nsinews had been so severely tested, and mounted into the hay-loft,\r\nwhere he remained concealed three nights and four days, sustaining\r\nhimself on cakes of chocolate. No one loved good cheer better than he,\r\nor indulged more in the pleasures of the table; but he made himself a\r\nslave to nothing, save the inordinate desire of other men's goods, and\r\npatiently contented himself with what would keep body and soul\r\ntogether till he was enabled to make his grand _coup_.\r\n\r\nAt last, Madame de Brienne went in all her glory to the Princess de\r\nMarsan's ball, and nearly all the domestics took advantage of the\r\nabsence of their mistress to leave the hotel in pursuit of their own\r\npleasures. Poulailler then descended from the hay-loft, made his way\r\nto the noble dame's cabinet, forced her secretaire, and possessed\r\nhimself of two thousand Louis d'or and a port-folio, which he\r\ndoubtless wished to examine at his ease; for, two days afterwards, he\r\nsent it back, (finding it furnished with such securities only as he\r\ncould not negotiate with safety,) and a polite note signed with his\r\nname, in which he begged the Princess graciously to receive the\r\nrestitution, and to accept the excuses of one who, had he not been\r\nsorely pressed for the moderate sum which he had ventured to take,\r\nwould never have thought of depriving the illustrious lady of it;\r\nadding, that when he was in cash, he should be delighted to lend her\r\ndouble the amount, should her occasions require it.\r\n\r\nThis impudent missive was lauded as a marvel of good taste at\r\nVersailles, where, for a whole week, every one talked of the\r\nconsummate cleverness and exquisite gallantry of the _Chevalier_ de\r\nPoulailler.\r\n\r\nThis title of honor stuck, and his fame seemed to inspire him with\r\nadditional ardor and address. His affairs having led him to Cambray,\r\nhe happened to have for a travelling companion the Dean of a\r\nwell-known noble Belgian chapter. The conversation rolled on the\r\nnotorieties of the day, and Poulailler was a more interesting theme\r\nthan the weather. But our chevalier was destined to listen to\r\nobservations that did not much flatter his self-esteem, for the Dean,\r\nso far from allowing him any merit whatever as a brigand,\r\ncharacterized him as an infamous and miserable cutpurse, adding, that\r\nat his first and approaching visit to Paris, he would make it his\r\nbusiness to see the lieutenant of police, and reproach him with the\r\nsmall pains he took to lay so vile a scoundrel by the heels.\r\n\r\nThe journey passed off without the occurrence of any thing remarkable;\r\nbut about a month after this colloquy M. Herault received a letter,\r\ninforming him that on the previous evening, M. de Potter,\r\n_chanoine-doyen_ of the noble chapter of Brussels, had been robbed and\r\nmurdered by Poulailler, who, clad in the habits of his victim, and\r\nfurnished with his papers, would enter the barrier St. Martin. This\r\nletter purported to have been written by one of his accomplices, who\r\nhad come to the determination of denouncing him in the hope of\r\nobtaining pardon.\r\n\r\nThe horror of M. Herault at the death of this dignified ecclesiastic,\r\nwho was personally unknown to him, was, if the truth must be told,\r\nmerged in the delight which that magistrate felt in the near prospect\r\nof avenging society and himself on this daring criminal. A cloud of\r\npolice officers hovered in ambush at each of the barriers, and\r\nespecially at that which bore the name of the saint who divided his\r\ncloak with the poor pilgrim, with directions to seize and bring into\r\nthe presence of M. Herault a man habited as an ecclesiastic, and with\r\nthe papers of the Dean of the Brussels chapter. Towards evening the\r\nLille coach arrived, was surrounded and escorted to the hotel des\r\nMessageries, and at the moment when the passengers descended, the\r\nofficers pounced upon the personage whose appearance and vestments\r\ncorresponded with their instructions.\r\n\r\nThe resistance made by this personage only sharpened the zeal of the\r\nofficers who seized him, and, in spite of his remonstrances and cries,\r\ncarried him to the hotel of the police, where M. Herault was prepared\r\nwith the proofs of Poulailler's crimes. Two worthy citizens of\r\nBrussels were there, anxious to see the murderer of their friend, the\r\nworthy ecclesiastic, whose loss they so much deplored: but what was\r\ntheir joy, and, it must be added, the disappointment of M. Herault,\r\nwhen the supposed criminal turned out to be no other than the good\r\nDean de Potter himself, safe and sound, but not a little indignant at\r\nthe outrage which he had sustained. Though a man of peace, his ire so\r\nfar ruffled a generally calm temper, that he could not help asking M.\r\nHerault whether Poulailler (from whom a second letter now arrived,\r\nlaughing at their beards) or he, M. Herault, was the chief director of\r\nthe police?\r\n\r\nWilliam of Deloraine, good at need--\r\n\r\n    By wily turns, by desperate bounds,\r\n    Had baffled Percy's best bloodhounds.\r\n    Five times outlawed had he been,\r\n    By England's king and Scotland's queen.\r\n\r\nBut he was never taken, and had no occasion for his\r\n\r\n    ----neck-verse at Hairibee,\r\n\r\neven if he could have read it. Poulailler was arrested no less than\r\nfive times, and five times did he break his bonds. Like Jack Sheppard\r\nand Claude du Val, he owed his escape in most instances to the frail\r\nfair ones, who would have dared any thing in favor of their favorite,\r\nand who, in Jack's case, joined on one occasion without jealousy in a\r\nsuccessful effort to save him.\r\n\r\nPoulailler was quite as much the pet of the petticoats as either of\r\nthese hempen heroes. With a fine person and accomplished manners, he\r\ncame, saw, and overcame, in more instances than that of the fair\r\ndaughter of the Baron von Kirbergen; but, unlike John Sheppard or\r\nClaude Du Val, Poulailler was cruel. Villains as they were, John and\r\nClaude behaved well, after their fashion, to those whom they robbed,\r\nand to the unhappy women with whom they associated. In their case, the\r\n\"ladies\" did their utmost to save them, and men were not wanting who\r\nendeavored to obtain a remission of their sentence. But Poulailler\r\nowed his fall to a woman whom he had ruined, ill-treated, and scorned.\r\nThe ruin and ill-treatment she bore, as the women, poor things, will\r\nbear such atrocities; but the scorn roused all the fury which the\r\npoets, Latin and English, have written of; and his cruelties were so\r\nflagrant, that he could find no man to say, \"God bless him.\"\r\n\r\nWilhelmina von Kirbergen had twice narrowly escaped from a violent\r\ndeath. Poulailler, in his capricious wrath, once stabbed her with such\r\nmurderous will, that she lay a long time on the verge of the grave,\r\nand then recovered to have the strength of her constitution tried by\r\nthe strength of a poison which he had administered to her in\r\ninsufficient quantities. Henry the Eighth forwarded his wives, when he\r\nwas tired of them, to the other world by form of what was in his time\r\nEnglish law; but when Poulailler \"felt the fulness of satiety,\" he got\r\nrid of his mistresses by a much more summary process. But it was not\r\ntill this accomplished scoundrel openly left Wilhelmina for a younger\r\nand more beautiful woman, that she, who had given up station, family,\r\nand friends, to link herself with his degrading life, abandoned\r\nherself to revenge.\r\n\r\nShe wrote to him whom she had loved so long and truly, to implore that\r\nthey might once more meet before they parted in peace for ever.\r\nPoulailler, too happy to be freed on such terms, accepted her\r\ninvitation, and was received so warmly that he half repented his\r\nvillainous conduct, and felt a return of his youthful affection. A\r\nsplendid supper gave zest to their animated conversation; but towards\r\nthe end of it, Poulailler observed a sudden change in his companion,\r\nwho manifested evident symptoms of suffering. Poulailler anxiously\r\ninquired the cause.\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" said she; \"a mere trifle--I have poisoned myself, that I\r\nmay not survive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quoi, coquine! m'aurais-tu fait aussi avaler le boucon?\" cried the\r\nterrified robber.\r\n\r\n\"That would not have sufficiently avenged me. Your death would have\r\nbeen too easy. No, my friend, you will leave this place safe and well;\r\nbut it will be to finish the night at the Conciergerie; and,\r\nto-morrow, as they have only to prove your identity, you will finish\r\nyour career on the wheel in the Place de Greve.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she clapped her hands, and, in an instant, before he had\r\ntime to move, the Philistines were upon him. Archers and other\r\nofficers swarmed from the hangings, door, and windows. For a few\r\nmoments, surrounded as he was, his indomitable courage seemed to\r\nrender the issue doubtful; but what could one man do against a host\r\narmed to the teeth? He was overpowered, notwithstanding his brave and\r\nvigorous resistance.\r\n\r\nHis death, however, was not so speedy as his wretched mistress\r\nprophesied that it would be. The love of life prevailed, and in the\r\nhope of gaining time which he might turn to account in effecting his\r\nescape, he promised to make revelations of importance to the state.\r\nThe authorities soon found out that he was trifling with them, and the\r\n_procureur-general_, after having caused him to be submitted to the\r\nmost excruciating torture, left him to be broken on the wheel alive.\r\nHe was executed with all the accursed refinement of barbarity which\r\ndisgraced the times; and his tormenters, at last, put the finishing\r\nstroke to his prolonged agonies, by throwing him alive into the fire\r\nthat blazed at his feet.\r\n\r\nNothing can justify such penal atrocities. If any thing could,\r\nPoulailler, it must be admitted, had wrought hard to bring down upon\r\nhimself the whole sharpness of the law of retaliation. Upwards of one\r\nhundred and fifty persons had been murdered by him and his band.\r\nResistance seemed to rouse in him and them the fury of devils. Nor was\r\nit only on such occasions that his murderous propensities were\r\nglutted.\r\n\r\nAt the village of St. Martin, he caused the father, the mother, two\r\nbrothers, a newly-married sister, her husband, and four relations, or\r\nfriends, to be butchered in cold blood.\r\n\r\nOne of his band was detected in an attempt to betray him. Poulailler\r\nhad him led to a cellar. The traitor was placed upright in an angle of\r\nthe wall, gagged, and there they built him in alive. Poulailler, with\r\nhis own hand, wrote the sentence and epitaph of the wretch on the soft\r\nplaster; and there it was found some years afterward, when the cellar\r\nin which this diabolical act of vengeance was perpetrated passed into\r\nthe hands of a new proprietor.\r\n\r\nIt was current in the country where Poulailler first saw the light,\r\nand where his father, mother, brethren, and sisters, still lived an\r\nhonorable life, embittered only by the horrible celebrity of their\r\nrelation, that, on the night which followed the day of Pierre's\r\nexecution, the isolated tower, which had been uninhabited since its\r\nlast occupant had so mysteriously disappeared, seemed all on fire,\r\nevery window remaining illuminated by the glowing element till morning\r\ndawned. During this fearful nocturnal spectacle, it was affirmed that\r\ninfernal howlings and harrowing cries proceeded from the apparently\r\nburning mass, and some peasants declared that they heard Pierre\r\nPoulailler's name shouted from the midst of the flames in a voice of\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nThe dawn showed the lonely tower unscathed by fire; but a fearful\r\ntempest arose, and raged with ceaseless fury for thrice twenty-four\r\nhours. The violence of the hurricane was such, that it was impossible\r\nduring that time for any vessel to keep the sea; and when at length\r\nthe storm subsided, the coast was covered with pieces of wreck, while\r\nthe waves continued for many days to give up their dead at the base of\r\nthe rock, from whose crest frowned _La Tour Maudite_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Hogg's Instructor.\r\n\r\nTHE LATE D. M. MOIR.\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE GILFILLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPleasant and joyous was the circle wont to assemble now and then (not\r\n_every_ night, as the public then fondly dreamed) in Ambrose's, some\r\ntwenty-five years ago: not a constellation in all our bright sky, at\r\npresent, half so brilliant. There sat John Wilson, \"lord of the\r\nlion-heart and eagle-eye,\" his hair somewhat thicker, and his eye\r\nrather brighter, and his complexion as fresh, and his talk as\r\npowerful, as now. There Lockhart appeared, with his sharp face,\r\n_adunco naso_, keen poignant talk, and absence of all enthusiasm.\r\nThere Maginn rollicked and roared, little expecting that he was ever\r\ndestined to stand a bankrupt and ruined man over Bunyan's dust, and\r\ncry, \"Sleep on, thou Prince of Dreamers!\" There De Quincey bowed and\r\nsmiled, while interposing his mild but terrible and unanswerable\r\n\"buts,\" and winding the subtle way of his talk through all subjects,\r\nhuman, infernal, and divine. There appeared the tall military form of\r\nold Syme, alias Timothy Tickler, with his pithy monosyllables, and\r\ndetermined _nil admirari_ bearing. There the Ettrick Shepherd told his\r\ninterminable stories, and drank his interminable tumblers. There sat\r\nsometimes, though seldom, a young man of erect port, mild gray eye,\r\nhigh head, rich quivering lips, and air of simple dignity, often\r\nforgetting to fill or empty his glass, but never forgetting to look\r\nreverently to the \"Professor,\" curiously and admiringly to De Quincey,\r\nand affectionately to all: it was Thomas Aird. There occasionally\r\nmight be seen Macnish of Glasgow, with his broad fun; Doubleday of\r\nNewcastle, then a rising litterateur; Leitch, the ventriloquist, (not\r\nprofessionally so, and yet not much inferior, we believe, to the\r\nfamous Duncan Macmillan); and even a stray Cockney or two who did not\r\nbelong to the Cockney school. There, too, the \"Director-general of the\r\nFine Arts,\" old Bridges, (uncle to our talented friend, William\r\nBridges, Esq. of London,) was often a guest, with his keen black eye,\r\nfinely-formed features, rough, ready talk, and a certain smack audible\r\non his lips when he spoke of a beautiful picture, a \"leading article\"\r\nin \"Maga,\" or of some of the queer adventures (_quorum pars fuit_) of\r\nChristopher North. And there, last, not least, was frequently seen the\r\nfine fair-haired head of Delta, the elegant poet, the amiable man, and\r\nthe author of one of the quaintest and most delightful of our Scottish\r\ntales, \"Mansie Wauch.\"\r\n\r\nThat brilliant circle was dissolved long ere we knew any of its\r\nmembers. We question if it was ever equalled, except thrice: once by\r\nthe Scriblerus Club, composed of Swift, Pope, Arbuthnot, Gay, and\r\nBolingbroke; again by the \"Literary Club,\" with its Johnson, Burke,\r\nGarrick, Beauclerk, Gibbon, and Fox: and more recently by the\r\n\"Round-table,\" with its Hazlitt, Hunt, Lamb, and their minor\r\ncompanions. It is now, we need not say, entirely dissolved, although\r\nmost of its members are yet alive, and although its doings and sayings\r\nhave been of late imitated in certain symposia, reminding us, in\r\ncomparison with the past, of the shadowy feasts of the dead beside\r\nreal human entertainments. The \"nights\" of the North are diviner than\r\nthe \"days.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this constellation, we mean, at present, to cut out one \"bright,\r\nparticular star,\" and to discourse of him. This is Delta, the\r\ndelightful. We have not the happiness of Dr. Moir's acquaintance, nor\r\ndid we ever see him, save once. It was at the great Edinburgh\r\nPhilosophic Feed of 1846, when Macaulay, Whately, and other lions,\r\nyoung and old, roared, on the whole, rather feebly, and in vulgar\r\nfalsetto, over their liberal provender. Delta, too, was a speaker, and\r\nhis speech had two merits, at least, modesty and brevity, and\r\ncontrasted thus well with Whately's egotistical rigmarole, Macaulay's\r\nlabored paradox, and Maclagan's inane bluster. He was, we understood\r\nafterwards, in poor health at the time, and did not do justice to\r\nhimself. But we have been long familiar with his poems in \"Blackwood\"\r\nand the \"Dumfries Herald,\" to which he occasionally contributed. We\r\nremember well when, next to a paper by North, or a poem by Aird, we\r\nlooked eagerly for one by Delta in each new number of \"Ebony;\" and we\r\nnow cheerfully proceed to say a few words about his true and exquisite\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nWe may call Delta the male Mrs. Hemans. Like her, he loved principally\r\nthe tender, the soft, and the beautiful. Like her, he excelled in\r\nfugitive verses, and seldom attempted, and still more seldom\r\nsucceeded, in the long or the labored poem. Like her, he tried a great\r\nvariety of styles and measures. Like her, he ever sought to interweave\r\na sweet and strong moral with his strains, and to bend them all in by\r\na graceful curve around the Cross. But, unlike her, his tone was\r\nuniformly glad and genial, and he exhibited none of that morbid\r\nmelancholy which lies often like a dark funeral edge around her most\r\nbeautiful poems: and this, because he was a _masculine_ shape of the\r\nsame elegant genus.\r\n\r\nDelta's principal powers were cultured sensibility, fine fancy, good\r\ntaste, and an easy, graceful style and versification. He sympathized\r\nwith all the \"outward forms of sky and earth, with all that was\r\nlovely, and pure, and of a good report\" in the heart and the history\r\nof humanity, and particularly with Scottish scenery, and Scottish\r\ncharacter and manners. His poetry was less a distinct power or vein,\r\nthan the general result and radiance of all his faculties. These\r\nexhaled out of them a fine genial enthusiasm, which expressed itself\r\nin song. We do not think, with Carlyle, that it is the same with _all_\r\nhigh poets. _He_ says--\"Poetry, except in such cases as that of Keats,\r\nwhere the whole consists in a weak-eyed maudlin sensibility, and a\r\ncertain vague tunefulness of nature, is no separate faculty, no organ\r\nwhich can be superadded to the rest, or disjoined from them, but\r\nrather the result of their general harmony and completion.\" Now, 1st,\r\nCarlyle is here grossly unjust to Keats. Had the author of Hyperion\r\nnothing but maudlin sensibility? If ever man was devoured, body and\r\nsoul, by that passion for, and perception of, the beauty and glory of\r\nthe universe, which is the essence of poetry, it was poor Keats. He\r\nwas poetry incarnate--the wine of the gods poured into a frail earthy\r\nvessel, which split around it. Nor has Burns, of whom Carlyle is here\r\nwriting, left any thing to be compared, in ideal qualities, in depth,\r\nand massiveness, and almost Miltonic magnificence, with the\r\ndescriptions of Saturn, and the Palace of the Sun, and the Senate of\r\nthe Gods in \"Hyperion.\" Burns was the finest lyrist of his or any age;\r\nbut Keats, had he lived, would have been one of the first of _epic_\r\npoets. 2dly, We do not very well comprehend what Carlyle means by the\r\nwords \"no organ, which can be superadded to, or disjoined from the\r\nrest.\" If he means that no culture can add, or want of it take away,\r\npoetic faculty, he is clearly right. But, if he means that nature\r\nnever confers a poetic vein distinct from, and superior to, the\r\nsurrounding faculties of the man, we must remind him of certain\r\nstubborn facts. Gay and Fontaine were \"fable-trees,\" Goldsmith was an\r\n\"inspired idiot.\" Godwin's powerful philosophic and descriptive genius\r\nseemed scarcely connected with the man; he had to _write_ himself\r\n_into_ it, and his friends could hardly believe him the author of his\r\nown works! Even Byron was but a common man, except at his desk, or \"on\r\nhis stool\" as he himself called it. He had to \"_call_\" his evil spirit\r\nfrom the vasty deep, and to lash himself very often into inspiration\r\nby a whip of \"Gin-_twist_.\" And James Hogg was little else than a\r\n_haverer_, till he sat down to write poetry, when the \"faery queen\"\r\nherself seemed to be speaking from within him. Nay, 3dly, we are\r\nconvinced that many men, of extraordinary powers otherwise, have in\r\nthem a vein of poetry as distinct from the rest as the bag of honey in\r\nthe bee is from his sting, his antennae, and his wings, and which\r\nrequires some special circumstance or excitement to develop it. Thus\r\nit was, we think, with Burke, Burns, and Carlyle himself. All these\r\nhad poetry in them, and have expressed it; but any of them might have\r\n_avoided_, in a great measure, its expression, and might have solely\r\nshone in other spheres. For example, Burke has written several works\r\nfull, indeed, of talent, but without a single gleam of that real\r\nimagination which other of his writings display. What a contrast\r\nbetween his \"Thoughts on the Present Discontents,\" or his \"Essay on\r\nthe Sublime and Beautiful,\" (an essay containing not one sublime, and\r\nnot two beautiful sentences in it all,) and the \"rare and regal\"\r\nrhetorical and poetic glories of his \"Essay on the French Revolution,\"\r\nor his \"Letters on a Regicide Peace!\" Burns might have been a\r\nphilosopher of the Dugald Stewart school, as acute and artificially\r\neloquent as any of them, had he gone to Edinburgh College instead of\r\ngoing to Irvine School. Carlyle might have been a prime-minister of a\r\nsomewhat original and salvage sort, had it been so ordered. None of\r\nthe three were so essentially poetical, that all their thoughts were\r\n\"twin-born with poetry,\" and rushed into the reflection of metaphor,\r\nas the morning beams into the embrace and reflection of the lake. All\r\nwere _stung_ into poetry: Burke by political zeal and personal\r\ndisappointment, Burns by love, and Carlyle by that white central heat\r\nof dissatisfaction with the world and the things of the world, which\r\nhis temperament has compelled him to express, but which his Scottish\r\ncommon sense has taught him the wisdom of expressing in earnest\r\nmasquerade and systematic metaphor. But, 4thly, there is a class of\r\npoets who have possessed more than the full complement of human\r\nfaculties, who have added to these extensive accomplishments and\r\nacquirements, and yet who have been so constituted, that imaginative\r\nutterance has been as essential to their thoughts as language itself.\r\nSuch were Dante, Milton, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, &c., and such\r\nare Wilson, Bailey, Aird, and Yendys. These are \"nothing, if not\r\npoetical.\" All their powers and acquisitions turn instinctively toward\r\npoetic expression, whether in verse or prose. And near them, although\r\non a somewhat lower plane, stood Delta.\r\n\r\nPoetry, with Delta, was rather the natural outflow of his whole soul\r\nand culture combined, than an art or science. His poetry was founded\r\non feelings, not on principles. Indeed, we fancy that little true\r\npoetry, in any age, has been systematic. It is generally the work of\r\nsudden enthusiasm, wild and rapid ecstasy acting upon a nature\r\n_prefitted_ for receiving the afflatus, whether by gift or by\r\naccomplishment, or by both united. Even the most thoroughly furnished\r\nhave been as dependent on moods and happy hours as the least. The wind\r\nof inspiration bloweth where it listeth. Witness Milton and Coleridge,\r\nboth of whom were masters of the theory of their art, nay, who had\r\nstudied it scientifically, and with a profound knowledge of cognate\r\nsciences, and yet both of whom could only build up the lofty rhyme at\r\ncertain seasons, and in certain circumstances, and who frequently\r\nperpetrated sheer dulness and drivel. The poetry of Homer, of\r\nEschylus, of Lucretius, of Byron, of Shelley, of Festus--in short, the\r\nmost of powerful poetry--has owed a vast deal more to excitement and\r\nenthusiasm than to study or elaborate culture. The rhapsodists were\r\nthe first, have been the best, and shall be the last of the poets. And\r\nwith what principles of poetic art were the bards of Israel\r\nconversant? And what systems of psychology or aesthetics had Shakspeare\r\nstudied? And in what college were trained the framers of the\r\nballad-poetry of the world--the lovers who soothed with song their\r\nburning hearts--the shepherds who sang amid their green\r\nwildernesses--the ploughmen who modulated to verse the motion of their\r\nsteers--the kings of the early time who shouted war-poetry from their\r\nchariots--the Berserkars whose long hair curled and shook as though\r\nlife were in it, to the music of their wild melodies--and the \"men of\r\nsturt and strife,\" the rough Macpherson-like heroes, whose spirits\r\nsprang away from the midst of flood and flame, from the gallows or the\r\nscaffold, on whirlwinds of extempore music and poetry? Poetry, with\r\nthem, was the irresistible expression of passion and of imagination,\r\nand hence its power; and to nothing still, but the same rod, can its\r\nliving waters flow amain. Certain fantastic fribbles of the present\r\nday may talk of \"principles of art,\" and \"principles of\r\nversification,\" and the necessity of studying poetry as a science, and\r\nmay exhaust the resources of midnight darkness in expressing their\r\nbedrivelled notions; but _our_ principle is this--\"Give us a gifted\r\nintellect, and warm true heart, and stir these with the fiery rod of\r\npassion and enthusiasm, and the result will be genuine, and high, and\r\nlasting poetry, as certainly as that light follows the sun.\"\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be objected, besides, that Delta has left no large or\r\ngreat poem. Now, here we trace the presence of another prevalent\r\nfallacy. Largeness is frequently confounded with greatness. But,\r\nbecause Milton's Paradise Lost is both large and great, it does not\r\nfollow that every great poem must be large, any more than that every\r\nlarge poem must be great. Pollok's Course of Time is a large and a\r\nclever, but scarcely a great poem. Hamlet and Faust may be read each\r\nin an hour, and yet both are great poems. Heraud's Judgment of the\r\nFlood is a vast folio in size, but a very second-rate poem in\r\nsubstance. Thomas Aird's Devil's Dream covers only four pages, yet who\r\never read it without the impression \"this is a great effort of\r\ngenius.\" Lalla Rookh was originally a quarto, but, although brilliant\r\nin the extreme, it can hardly be called a poem at all. Burns's Vision\r\nof Liberty contains, in the space of thirty-two lines, we hesitate not\r\nto say, all the elements of a great poem. Although Delta's poems be\r\nnot large, it is not a necessary corollary that they are inferior\r\nproductions. And if none of them, perhaps, fill up the whole measure\r\nof the term \"great,\" many of them are beautiful, all are genuine, and\r\nsome, such as Casa Wappy, are exquisite.\r\n\r\nHealth is one eminent quality in this pleasing writer. Free\r\noriginally from morbid tendencies, he has nursed and cherished this\r\nhappy tone of mind by perusing chiefly healthy authors. He has acted\r\non the principle that the whole should be kept from the sick. He has\r\ndipped but sparingly into the pages of Byron and Shelley, whereas\r\nWordsworth, Wilson, Southey, and Scott, are the gods of his idolatry.\r\nScott is transcendently clear. Indeed, we think that he gives to him,\r\n_as a poet_, a place beyond his just deserts. His ease, simplicity,\r\nromantic interest, and Border fire, have blinded him to his faults,\r\nhis fatal facility of verse, his looseness of construction, and his\r\nsad want of deep thought and original sentiment. To name him beside or\r\nabove Wordsworth, the great consecrated bard of his period, is\r\ncertainly a heresy of no small order. One or two of Wordsworth's\r\nlittle poems, or of his sonnets, are, we venture to say, in genuine\r\npoetical depth and beauty, superior to Scott's _five_ larger poems put\r\ntogether. _They_ are long, lively, rambling, shallow, and blue,\r\nglittering streams. Wordsworth's ballads are deep and clear as those\r\nmountain pools over which bends the rowan, and on which smiles the\r\nautumn sky, as on the fittest reflector of its own bright profundity\r\nand solemn clearness.\r\n\r\nWell did Christopher North characterize Delta as the poet of the\r\nspring. He was the darling of that darling season. In all his poetry\r\nthere leaped and frolicked \"vernal delight and joy.\" He had in some of\r\nhis verses admirably, and on purpose, expressed the many feelings or\r\nimages which then throng around the heart, like a cluster of bees\r\nsettling at once upon flower--the sense of absolute newness, blended\r\nwith a faint, rich thrill of recollection--the fresh bubbling out of\r\nthe blood from the heart-springs--the return of the reveries of\r\nchildhood or youth--the intolerance of the fireside--the thirst after\r\nnature renewed within the soul--the strange glory shed upon the earth,\r\nall red and bare though it yet be--the attention excited by every\r\nthing, \"even by the noise of the fly upon the sunny wall, or the\r\nslightest murmur of creeping waters\"--the springing up of the sun from\r\nhis winter declinature--the softer and warmer lustre of the stars--and\r\nthe new emphasis with which men pronounce the words \"hope\" and \"love.\"\r\nTo crown a spring evening, there sometimes appears in the west the\r\nplanet Venus, bright yellow-green, shivering as with ecstasy in the\r\norange or purple sky, and rounding off the whole scene into the\r\nperfection of beauty. The Scottish poet of spring did not forget this\r\nelement of its glory, but sung a hymn to that fair star of morn and\r\neve worthy of its serene, yet tremulous splendor.\r\n\r\nDelta was eminently a national writer. He did not gad abroad in search\r\nof the sublime or strange, but cultivated the art of staying at home.\r\nThe scenery of his own neighborhood, the traditions or the histories\r\nof his own country, the skies and stars of Scotland, the wild or\r\nbeautiful legends which glimmer through the mist of its past--these\r\nwere \"the haunt and the main region of his song,\" and hence, in part,\r\nthe sweetness and the strength of his strains. Indeed, it is\r\nremarkable that nearly all our Scottish poets have been national and\r\ndescriptive. Scotland has produced no real epic, few powerful\r\ntragedies, few meditative poems of a high rank, but what a mass of\r\npoetry describing its own scenery and manners, and recording its own\r\ntraditions. King James the Sixth, Gawin Douglas, Davie Lyndsay,\r\nRamsay, Fergusson, Ross of the \"Faithful Shepherdess,\" Burns, Beattie,\r\nSir Walter Scott, Wilson, Aird, Delta, and twenty more, have been all\r\nmore or less national in their subject, or language, or both. We\r\nattribute this, in a great measure, to the extreme peculiarity of\r\nScottish manners, _as they were_, and to the extreme and romantic\r\nbeauty of Scottish scenery. The poetic minds, in a tame country like\r\nEngland, are thrown out upon foreign topics, or thrown in upon\r\nthemselves; whereas, in Scotland, they are arrested and detained\r\nwithin the circle of their own manners and mountains. \"Paint _us_\r\nfirst,\" the hills seem to cry aloud. A reason, too, why we have had\r\nfew good tragedies or meditative poems, may be found in our national\r\nnarrowness of creed, and in our strong prejudice against dramatic\r\nentertainments. As it is, we have only Douglas, and three or four good\r\nplays of Miss Baillie's, to balance Shakspeare, Ben Jonson, and all\r\nthat galaxy--not to speak of the multitudes who have followed--and\r\nonly the \"Grave,\" the \"Minstrel,\" and the \"Course of Time,\" to compare\r\nwith the works of George Herbert, Giles Fletcher, Quarles, Milton,\r\nYoung, Cowper, and Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nWe find in Delta little meditative power or tendency. His muse had no\r\n\"speculation\" in her eye. Whether from caution, or from want of the\r\npeculiar faculty, he never approached those awful abysses of thought\r\nwhich are now attracting so many poets--attracting them, partly from a\r\ndesire to look down into their darkness, and partly from a passion for\r\nthose strange and shivering flowers which grow around their sides.\r\nLeigh Hunt, in his late autobiography, when speaking of Blanco White,\r\nseems to blame all religious speculation, as alike hopeless and\r\nuseless. But, in the present day, unless there be religious\r\nspeculation, there can, with men of mind, be little religion--no\r\ncreed--nor even an approximation toward one. Would Mr. Hunt destroy\r\nthat link, which in every age has bound us to the infinite and\r\neternal? Would he bring us back to mere brute worship, and brute\r\nbelief? Because we cannot at present form an infallible creed, should\r\nwe beware of seeking to form a creed at all? Because we cannot see all\r\nthe stars, must we never raise our eyes, or our telescopes, to the\r\nmidnight heavens? Because HE has been able to reach no consistent and\r\ninfluential faith, ought all men to abandon the task? So far from\r\nagreeing with this dogmatic denunciation, we hold that it argues on\r\nthe part of its author--revered and beloved though he be--a certain\r\nshallowness and levity of spirit--that its tendency is to crush a\r\nprinciple of aspiration in the human mind, which may be likened to an\r\noutspringing angel pinion, and that it indirectly questions the use\r\nand the truth of all revelation. We honor, we must say, Blanco White,\r\nin his noble struggles, and in his divine despair, more than Leigh\r\nHunt, in his denial that such struggles are wiser than a maniac's\r\ntrying to leap to the sun, and in the ignoble conceptions of man's\r\nposition and destiny which his words imply. And, notwithstanding his\r\nchilling criticism, so unlike his wont, we believe still, with\r\nColeridge, that not Wordsworth, nor Milton, have written a sonnet,\r\nembodying a thought so new and magnificent, in language so sweet and\r\nmusical, and perfectly fitted to the thought, like the silvery new\r\nmoon sheathed in a transparent fleecy cloud, as that of Blanco White's\r\nbeginning with \"Mysterious Night.\"\r\n\r\nDelta, we have already said, gained reputation, in prose, as well as\r\nin verse. His _Mansie Wauch, Tailor in Dalkeith_, is one of the most\r\ndelightful books in the language. It is partly, it is true, imitated\r\nfrom Galt; but, while not inferior to him in humor, it has infused a\r\nfar deeper vein of poetry into the conception of common Scottish life.\r\nHonor to thee, honest Mansie! Thou art worth twenty Alton Lockes, the\r\nmetaphysical tailor (certainly one of the absurdest creations, and\r\nsurrounded by the most asinine story of the age, although redeemed by\r\nsome glorious scenes, and _one_ character, Sandy Mackay, who is just\r\nThomas Carlyle _humanized_). But better than thee still, is thy\r\n'prentice, Mungo Glen, with decline in his lungs, poetry in his heart,\r\nand on his lips one of the sweetest laments in the language! Many\r\nyears have elapsed since we read thy life, but our laughter at thy\r\nadventures, and our tears at the death of thy poor 'prentice, seem as\r\nfresh as those of yesterday!\r\n\r\nWhy did Delta only open, and never dig out, this new and rich vein? He\r\nalone seemed adequate to follow, however far off, in the steps of the\r\nGreat Wizard. Aird seemed to have exhausted his tale-writing faculty,\r\nexquisite as it was. Wilson's tales, with all their power, lack\r\nrepose; they are too troubled, tearful, monotonous, and tempestuous.\r\nGalt, Miss Ferrier, the authoress of the Odd Volume, Macnish, &c., are\r\ndead....\r\n\r\nWe had not the pleasure of hearing Delta's recent lectures. They were,\r\nchatty, conversational, lively, full of information, although neither\r\nvery eloquent, nor very profound. He knew too well the position in\r\nwhich he stood, and the provender which his audience required! Nor, we\r\nconfess, did we expect to meet in them with a comprehensive or final\r\nvidimus of the poetry of the last fifty years. His Edinburgh eye has\r\nbeen too much dazzled and overpowered by the near orbs of Walter Scott\r\nand Wilson, to do justice to remoter luminaries. Nor was criticism\r\nexactly Delta's forte. He had not enough of subtility--perhaps not\r\nenough of profound native instinct--and, perhaps, _some_ will think,\r\nnot enough of bad blood. But his criticism must, we doubt not, be\r\nalways sincere in feeling, candid in spirit, and manly in language.\r\nStill, we repeat, that his power and mission were in the description\r\nof the woods and streams, the feelings and customs, the beauties and\r\npeculiarities, of 'dear Auld Scotland.'\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be necessary to add, that the name Delta was applied to\r\nDr. Moir, from his signature in \"Black wood,\" which was always [Symbol:\r\nDelta]; that he was a physician in Musselburgh, and the author of some\r\nexcellent treaties on subjects connected with his own profession; and that\r\nwhile an accomplished litterateur and beautiful poet, he never neglected\r\nhis peculiar duties, but stood as high in the medical as in the literary\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE DESERTED MANSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years ago, a picture appeared in the Exhibition of the Royal\r\nAcademy, which peculiarly impressed my imagination; it represented an\r\nancient ruinous dwelling, surrounded by dilapidated gardens, set in\r\nsombre woods. The venerable trees, the moat filled with nettles and\r\nrubbish, the broken fences, green stagnant waters, the gabled,\r\nturreted, many-windowed, mouldering mansion, a perfect medley of\r\nchaotic architecture. The _visible silence_, the spirit of supreme\r\ndesolation brooding over the precincts, filled my mind with\r\ninvoluntary sadness; while fancy conjured up strange, wild tales of\r\nother days, in connection with the scene. I could not shake off the\r\nbelief that reality was portrayed on the canvas; and writing an\r\naccount of the various pictures to a friend who resided in the\r\ncountry, I dwelt on this particular one, and my singular impressions\r\nrespecting it. When I next received a letter from my friend, she\r\nremarked how unaccountable my fancies were; fancies which were,\r\nhowever, based on the foundation of truth.\r\n\r\nShe went on to say, that reading my letter to Mrs. L----, an\r\noctogenarian in wonderful preservation, that lady informed her of the\r\nlocality of my deserted mansion, and also of its history; the picture\r\nbeing actually painted for Mrs. L----'s son; and the tale attached to\r\nit, which my friend eventually gave me in the old lady's own words,\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Fifty years ago, the mansion of St. Elan's Wood was reckoned ancient,\r\nbut it was a healthful, vigorous age, interesting and picturesque.\r\nThen, emerald turf lined the sides of the moat, and blooming flowers\r\nclustered within its sloping shelter; white drapery fluttered within\r\nthe quaint latticed windows, and delicate climbers festooned them\r\nwithout; terraced walks and thick hollow hedges were in trim order,\r\nfountains sparkled in the sunshine, and blushing roses bent over and\r\nkissed the clear rejoicing waters.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty years ago, joyous laughter resounded amid the greenwood glades,\r\nand buoyant footsteps pressed the greensward; for the master of St.\r\nElan's had brought home a bride, and friends and relatives hastened\r\nthither to offer congratulations, and to share the hospitalities of\r\nthe festive season.\r\n\r\n\"Lady St. Elan was a very young wife; a soft-eyed, timid creature; her\r\nmother had died during her daughter's infancy, and her father (an\r\nofficer of high rank in the army) being abroad, a lady whom we shall\r\ncall Sabina, by whom she had been educated, accompanied her beloved\r\npupil, now Lady St. Elan, to this new home. The death of Lady St.\r\nElan's father, and the birth of a daughter, eventually mingled\r\nrejoicing and mourning together, while great anxiety was felt for the\r\nyoung mother, whose recovery was extremely tedious. The visits of\r\neminent physicians, who were sent for from great distances, evinced\r\nthe fears which were still entertained, even when the invalid roamed\r\nonce more in the pleasant garden and woods around. Alas! it was not\r\nfor the poor lady's bodily health they feared; the hereditary mental\r\nmalady of her family on the maternal side, but which had slumbered for\r\ntwo generations, again darkly shadowed forth its dread approaches.\r\nSlight, indeed, had been the warning as yet, subtle the demonstrations\r\nof the deadly enemy, but enough to alarm the watchful husband, who was\r\nwell acquainted with the facts. But the alarm passed away, the\r\nphysicians came no more, and apparent health and strength, both mental\r\nand physical, were fully restored to the patient, while the sweet babe\r\nreally deserved the epithets lavished on it by the delighted mother of\r\nthe 'divinest baby in the world.'\r\n\r\n\"During the temporary absence of her husband, on affairs of urgent\r\nbusiness, Lady St. Elan requested Sabina to share her chamber at\r\nnight, on the plea of timidity and loneliness; this wish was\r\ncheerfully complied with, and two or three days passed pleasantly\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"St. Elan was expected to return home on the following morning, and\r\nwhen the friends retired to rest on the previous night, Sabina\r\nwithdrew the window curtains, to gaze upon the glorious landscape\r\nwhich stretched far away, all bathed in silver radiance, and she soon\r\nfell into a tranquil slumber, communing with holy thoughts and\r\nprayerful aspirations. She was suddenly awakened by a curious kind of\r\nsound in the room, accompanied by a half-stifled jeering laugh. She\r\nknew not how long sleep had lulled her in oblivion, but when Sabina\r\nturned round to see from whence the sound proceeded, imagine her\r\nhorror and dismay at beholding Lady St. Elan standing near the door,\r\nsharpening a large knife on her slipper, looking wildly round now and\r\nthen, muttering and jibing.\r\n\r\n\"'Not sharp enough yet--not sharp enough yet,' she exclaimed, intently\r\npursuing her occupation.\r\n\r\n\"Sabina felt instinctively, that this was no practical _joke_; she\r\nknew instinctively the dread reality--by the maniac's eye--by the tone\r\nof voice--and she sprang from the bed, darting towards the door. It\r\nwas locked. Lady St. Elan looked cunningly up, muttering--\r\n\r\n\"'So you thought I was so silly, did you? But I double-locked it, and\r\nthrew the key out of the window; and perhaps you may spy out in the\r\nmoonshine you're so fond of admiring,' pointing to an open casement,\r\nat an immense height from the ground--for this apartment was at the\r\nsummit of a turret, commanding an extensive view, chosen for that\r\nreason, as well as for its seclusion and repose, being so far distant\r\nfrom the rest of the household.\r\n\r\n\"Sabina was not afflicted with weak nerves, and as the full danger of\r\nher position flashed across her mind, she remembered to have heard\r\nthat the human eye possesses extraordinary power to quell and keep in\r\nabeyance all unruly passions thus terrifically displayed. She was also\r\naware, that in a contest where mere bodily energy was concerned, her\r\npowers must prove utterly inadequate and unavailing, when brought into\r\ncompetition with those of the unfortunate lady during a continuance of\r\nthe paroxysm. Sabina feigned a calmness which she was far from feeling\r\nat that trying moment, and though her voice trembled, yet she said\r\ncheerfully, and with a careless air--\r\n\r\n\"'I think your knife will soon be sharp enough, Lady St. Elan; what do\r\nyou want it for?'\r\n\r\n\"'What do I want it for?' mimicked the mad woman; 'why what should I\r\nwant it for, Sabina, but to cut your throat with?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, that is an odd fancy,' exclaimed Sabina, endeavoring not to\r\nscream or to faint: 'but you had better sit down, for the knife is not\r\nsharp enough for that job--there--there's a chair. Now give me your\r\nattention while you sharpen, and I'll sit opposite to you; for I have\r\nhad such an extraordinary dream, and I want you to listen to it.'\r\n\r\n\"The lady looked maliciously sly, as much as to say, 'You shall not\r\ncheat me, if I _do_ listen.' But she sat down, and Sabina opposite to\r\nher, who began pouring forth a farrago of nonsense, which she\r\npretended to have dreamt. Lady St. Elan had always been much addicted\r\nto perusing works of romantic fiction, and this taste for the\r\nmarvellous was, probably, the means of saving Sabina's life, who,\r\nduring that long and awful night, never flagged for one moment,\r\ncontinuing her repetition of marvels in the _Arabian Night's_ style.\r\nThe maniac sat perfectly still, with the knife in one hand, the\r\nslipper in the other, and her large eyes intently fixed on the\r\nnarrator. Oh, those weary, weary hours! When, at length, repeated\r\nsignals and knocks were heard at the chamber-door, as the morning sun\r\narose, Sabina had presence of mind not to notice them, as her terrible\r\ncompanion appeared not to do so; but she continued her sing-song,\r\nmonotonous strain, until the barrier was fairly burst open, and St.\r\nElan himself, who had just returned, alarmed at the portentous murmurs\r\nwithin, and accompanied by several domestics, came to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\"Had Sabina moved, or screamed for help, or appeared to recognize the\r\naid which was at hand, ere it could have reached her, the knife might\r\nhave been sheathed in her heart. This knife was a foreign one of\r\nquaint workmanship, usually hanging up in St. Elan's dressing-room;\r\nand the premeditation evinced in thus secreting it was a mystery not\r\nto be solved. Sabina's hair which was black as the raven's wing, when\r\nshe retired to rest on that fearful night, had changed to the\r\nsimilitude of extreme age when they found her in the morning. Lady St.\r\nElan never recovered this sudden and total overthrow of reason, but\r\ndied--alas! it was rumored, by her own hand--within two years\r\nafterwards. The infant heiress was entrusted to the guidance of her\r\nmother's friend and governess; she became an orphan at an early age,\r\nand on completing her twenty-first year was uncontrolled mistress of\r\nthe fortune and estates of her ancestors.\r\n\r\n\"But long ere that period arrived, a serious question had arisen in\r\nSabina's mind respecting the duty and expediency of informing Mary St.\r\nElan what her true position was, and gently imparting the sad\r\nknowledge of that visitation overshadowing the destinies of her race.\r\nIt was true that in her individual case the catastrophe might be\r\nwarded off, while, on the other hand, there was lurking, threatening\r\ndanger; but a high religious principle seemed to demand a sacrifice,\r\nor self-immolation, in order to prevent the possibility of a\r\nperpetuation of the direful malady.\r\n\r\n\"Sabina felt assured that were her noble-hearted pupil once to learn\r\nthe facts, there would be no hesitation on her part in strictly\r\nadhering to the prescribed line of right; it was a bitter task for\r\nSabina to undertake, but she did not shrink from performing it when\r\nher resolution became matured, and her scruples settled into decision,\r\nformed on the solid basis of duty to God and man. Sabina afterwards\r\nlearnt that the sacrifice demanded of Mary St. Elan was far more\r\nheroic than she had contemplated; and when that sweet young creature\r\ndevoted herself to a life of celibacy, Sabina did not know, that\r\nengrossed by 'first love,' of which so much has been said and sung,\r\nMary St. Elan bade adieu to life's hope and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"With a woman's delicate perception and depth of pity, Sabina gained\r\nthat knowledge; and with honor unspeakable she silently read the\r\ntreasured secrets of the gentle heart thus fatally wounded--the evil\r\nfrom which she had sedulously striven to guard her pupil, had not been\r\nsuccessfully averted--Mary St. Elan had already given away her\r\nguileless heart. But her sorrows were not doomed to last; for soon\r\nafter that period when the law pronounced her free from control\r\nrespecting her worldly affairs, the last of the St. Elans passed\r\npeacefully away to a better world, bequeathing the mansion house and\r\nestate of St. Elan's Wood to Sabina and her heirs. In Sabina's\r\nestimation, however, this munificent gift was the 'price of blood:' as\r\nbut for _her_ instrumentality, the fatal knowledge would not have been\r\nimparted; but for _her_ the ancestral woods and pleasant home might\r\nhave descended to children's children in the St. Elan's\r\nline,--tainted, indeed, and doomed; but now the race was extinct.\r\n\r\n\"There were many persons who laughed at Sabina's sensitive feelings on\r\nthis subject, which they could not understand; and even well-meaning,\r\npious folk, thought that she carried her strict notions, too far. Yet\r\nSabina remained immovable; nor would she ever consent that the wealth\r\nthus left should be enjoyed by her or hers.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the deserted mansion still remains unclaimed, though it will not\r\nbe long ere it is appropriated to the useful and beneficent purpose\r\nspecified in Mary St. Elan's will--namely, failing Sabina and her\r\nissue, to be converted into a lunatic asylum--a kind of lunatic\r\nalms-house for decayed gentlewomen, who, with the requisite\r\nqualifications, will here find refuge from the double storms of life\r\nassailing them, poor souls! both from within and without.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what became of Sabina, and what interest has your son in this\r\npicture?\" asked my friend of old Mrs. L----, as that venerable lady\r\nconcluded her narration; \"for if none live to claim the property, why\r\ndoes it still remain thus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your justifiable curiosity shall be gratified, my dear,\" responded\r\nthe kindly dame. \"Look at my hair--it did not turn white from age: I\r\nretired to rest one night with glossy braids, black as the raven's\r\nwing, and they found me in the morning as you now behold me! Yes, it\r\nis even so; and you no longer wonder that Sabina's son desired to\r\npossess this identical painting; my pilgrimage is drawing towards its\r\nclose--protracted as it has been beyond the allotted age of man--but,\r\naccording to the tenor of the afore-named will, the mansion and estate\r\nof St. Elan must remain as they now stand until I am no more; while\r\nthe accumulated funds will amply endow the excellent charity. Were my\r\nson less honorable or scrupulous, he might, of course, claim the\r\nproperty on my decease; but respect for his mother's memory, with firm\r\nadherence to her principles, will keep him, with God's blessing, from\r\nyielding to temptation. He is not a rich man, but with proud humility\r\nhe may gaze on this memorial picture, and hand it down to posterity\r\nwith the traditionary lore attached; and may none of our descendants\r\never lament the use which will be made, nor covet the possession, of\r\nthis deserted mansion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Hogg's Instructor.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS OF MOTIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that in the universe there can be but one infallible\r\nJudge of motives. None but its Maker can see into the secret springs,\r\nand clearly comprehend the motions, of the mind. Nevertheless, \"the\r\nwill for the deed\" is an old understanding among mankind, in virtue of\r\nthat inward life whose world and workings they know to extend so far\r\nbeyond the visible. It is, indeed, the privilege, and in some sense a\r\nnecessity of human reason, to inquire after, at least, obvious\r\nmotives, since the smallest acquaintance with character or history\r\ncannot be formed without taking them into account. Thus, in the\r\nbiographies of notable men, in the histories of nations, and in the\r\ngossip which constitutes the current history of most neighborhoods,\r\nand is relished alike by the denizens of court and hamlet, nobody is\r\nsatisfied with knowing merely what was done, for the demand invariably\r\nfollows, Why they did it? That query is often necessary to legal, and\r\nalways to moral justice. It must be, so to speak, a most mechanical\r\nand surface life, whose daily doings the beholder can fully explain,\r\nindependent of any reference to inward feelings, unuttered memories,\r\nor concealed hopes. How many deeds and whole courses of action,\r\nchameleon-like, utterly change their complexions, according to the\r\nlight of attributed motives! Through that medium, the patriot of one\r\nparty becomes the heartless and designing knave of another; and the\r\nfanatical revolutionists of their own generation turn to fearless\r\nreformers with the next. Many an act, on the details of which most\r\nhistorians are agreed, is held up by one to the world's praise, and by\r\nanother to universal censure. Henri Quatre, says the first, conformed\r\nto Catholicism rather than continue a civil war in his kingdom; while\r\na second remarks of the same monarch, that he sacrificed his faith for\r\na crown. When Frederick-William of Prussia was just at the hottest of\r\nthat persecution of his celebrated son, for which, together with his\r\nlove of tall soldiers, he is best known to the world, the grand\r\ndispute amongst his favorite guards at Potsdam was, whether the kicks,\r\ncuffs, and imprisonments, which the old king bestowed so liberally on\r\nhis heir-apparent, were intended to prevent young Fritz turning an\r\ninfidel, or arose from his father's fears that he might be a greater\r\nman than himself! On no subject are mankind more apt to differ,\r\nprobably because there are few on which observation affords so much\r\ninferential and so little direct evidence.\r\n\r\nApproaching the innermost circles of private life, we find that the\r\nviews entertained of motives exercise a still greater influence in\r\ndetermining our estimation of kindred, friends, or lovers. Volpone, in\r\nBen Jonson's play, even had he been capable of it, could have no cause\r\nfor gratitude to his numerous friends for all their gifts and\r\nattentions, knowing so perfectly as he did, that they came but in\r\nexpectation of a legacy; and many a well-portioned dame has seen cause\r\nfor applying to her most attentive suitor those lines of a homely\r\nScottish song--\r\n\r\n    \"My lad is sae muckle in love wi' my siller,\r\n    He canna hae love to spare for me.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a strange difference of opinion existing at times between the\r\nprincipals and the spectators of these particular affairs. Few, it has\r\nbeen said, can penetrate the motives of others in matters regarding\r\nthemselves. Yet most people are wonderfully sharp-sighted where their\r\nneighbors are concerned; and the world--as every one of us is apt to\r\ncall that fraction of society in which we live, and move, and have our\r\nassociations--though generally not over charitable, is rarely wrong in\r\nits conclusions.\r\n\r\nHe was a keen observer of life who remarked that the rapid changes to\r\nwhich most of human friendships and enmities are liable, could be no\r\nmatter of surprise to one who took note of the motives from which they\r\ngenerally originate. Poor and unsubstantial enough these doubtless\r\nare, in many a case. There have been friendships that owed their\r\ngrowth solely to showers of flattery, and bitter enmities have\r\nspontaneously sprung up in the soil of envy. It was said of Goldsmith,\r\nthat he could never hear a brother poet, or, indeed, any citizen of\r\nthe world of letters, praised, without entertaining a temporary\r\naversion to that individual, and a similar effect was always produced\r\nby the smallest sign of increasing literary consequence. A report that\r\nM---- had been taken particular notice of by such a nobleman of those\r\npatronizing times, or that his works had been admired in some segment\r\nof the fashionable circle, was sufficient to make the author of the\r\n\"Deserted Village\" find all manner of faults with him and his, till\r\ntime, or his habitual good nature, wiped the circumstance out of\r\nGoldsmith's remembrance.\r\n\r\nThis reminds one of Madame de Montespan, a belle of that order which\r\nreigned most triumphantly at the court of Louis XIV., who never could\r\nforgive her rival, even when disgraced and dead, because she had once\r\ngot a ride in the royal carriage. It is curious that the learned and\r\nthe fair, far as their general pursuits, and visibilities, too, are\r\nknown to be apart, should, according to common report, approximate so\r\nnearly in their motives to enmity or friendship. George Colman used to\r\nsay, that, if one had any interest in getting up a quarrel between\r\neither two fine ladies or two literary men, he had nothing to do but\r\nto praise the one energetically to the other, and the higher his\r\nenthusiasm rose, the fiercer would be the war.\r\n\r\nIt was asserted of both the elder and younger Scaliger, that they\r\nnever applauded any scholar with all their might, but one who was\r\nmanifestly inferior to themselves; and of Madame de Maintenon, that\r\nshe never honored any one with her special friendship who was not, in\r\nsome considerable point, beneath her. There is still a large class of\r\ncharacters, in all whose attachments a something to despise seems the\r\nindispensable ingredient. The perpetual triumph of being always \"king\r\nof the company\" has a binding attraction for such minds. It confers a\r\nkind of dictatorship to have the advantage of one's friends. Nothing\r\nelse can explain the amount of patronage and befriending generally\r\nlavished on the most worthless members of families or societies; and\r\nthe half-grudge, half-surveillance, which, under the covert of mere\r\nmouth-honor, often surrounds great or successful abilities.\r\n\r\nA strange motive to enmity is illustrated in the life of General\r\nLoudoun, one of the Scotch Jacobites, who, on the defeat of his party,\r\nentered the Austrian service, and rose to the rank of field-marshal in\r\nthe wars of Maria Theresa. He had taken the town of Seidlitz from the\r\nPrussians. It was a great stroke in favor of the empress queen, and\r\nmight have been rewarded with a coronet, but, in his haste to send her\r\nmajesty the intelligence, Loudoun transmitted it through her husband,\r\nthe Emperor Francis, who had a private interest in the matter, having\r\nlong carried on a speculation of his own in victualling not only his\r\nwife's troops, but those of her Prussian enemy. King Maria, as she was\r\nstyled by her Hungarian subjects, had also some special reasons for\r\nallowing him to have neither hand nor voice in her concerns--a fact\r\nwhich the marshal had never learned, or forgotten; and her majesty was\r\nso indignant at receiving the news through such a channel, that,\r\nthough she struck a medal to commemorate the taking of Seidlitz,\r\nLoudoun was rewarded only with her peculiar aversion throughout the\r\nremaining seventeen years of her reign, for which the good wishes of\r\nthat imperial speculator in forage and flour afforded but poor\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nOf all the important steps of human life, that by which two are made\r\none appears to be taken from the greatest variety of motives.\r\nDoubtless, from the beginning it was not so; but manifold and\r\nheterogeneous are those which have been alleged for it in the\r\ncivilized world. Goethe said he married to attain popular\r\nrespectability. Wilkes, once called the Patriot, when sueing his wife,\r\nwho chanced to have been an heiress, for the remains of her property,\r\ndeclared that he had wedded at twenty-two, solely to please his\r\nfriends; and Wycherly the poet, in his very last days, worshipped and\r\nendowed with all his worldly goods, as the English service hath it, a\r\ngirl whom poverty had made unscrupulous, in order to be revenged on\r\nhis relations.\r\n\r\nPrinces of old were in the habit of marrying to cement treaties, which\r\nwere generally broken as soon after as possible; and simple citizens\r\nare still addicted to the same method of amending their fortunes and\r\nfamilies. There was an original motive to double blessedness set forth\r\nin the advice of a veteran sportsman in one of the border counties.\r\nHis niece was the heiress of broad lands, which happened to adjoin an\r\nestate belonging to a younger brother of the turf; and the senior\r\ngentleman, when dilating to her on the exploits they had performed\r\ntogether by wood and wold, wound up with the following sage\r\ncounsel--\"Maria, take my advice, and marry young Beechwood, and you'll\r\nsee this county hunted in style.\"\r\n\r\nThe numbers who, by their own account, have wedded to benefit society,\r\nin one shape or another, would furnish a strong argument against the\r\naccredited selfishness of mankind, could they only be believed. The\r\ngeneral good of their country was the standing excuse of classic\r\ntimes, and philosophers have occasionally reproduced it in our own.\r\nMost people seem to think some apology necessary, but none are so\r\ningenious in showing cause why they should enter the holy state, as\r\nthose with whom it is the second experiment. The pleas of the widowed\r\nfor casting off their weeds are generally prudent, and often\r\nsingularly commendable. Domestic policy or parental affection supply\r\nthe greater part of them; and the want of protectors and step-mothers\r\nfelt by families of all sizes is truly marvellous, considering the\r\nusual consequences of their instalment.\r\n\r\nIt is to be admired, as the speakers of old English would say, for\r\nwhat noble things men will give themselves credit in the way of\r\nmotives, and how little resemblance their actions bear to them.\r\nMontaigne was accustomed to tell of a servant belonging to the\r\nArchbishop of Paris, who, being detected in privately selling his\r\nmaster's best wine, insisted that it was done out of pure love to his\r\ngrace, lest the sight of so large a stock in his cellar might tempt\r\nhim to drink more than was commendable for a bishop. A guardian care\r\nof their neighbors' well-being, somewhat similar, is declared by all\r\nthe disturbers of our daily paths. Tale-bearers and remarkers, of\r\nevery variety, have the best interests of their friends at heart; and\r\nwhat troublesome things some people can do from a sense of duty is\r\nmatter of universal experience. Great public criminals, tyrants, and\r\npersecutors in old times, and the abusers of power in all ages, have,\r\nespecially in the fall of their authority, laid claim to most exalted\r\nmotives. Patriotism, philanthropy, and religion itself, have been\r\nquoted as their inspirers. The ill-famed Judge Jeffries said, his\r\njudicial crimes were perpetrated to maintain the majesty of the law.\r\nRobespierre affirmed that he had lived in defence of virtue and his\r\ncountry. But perhaps the most charitable interpretation that ever man\r\ngave to the motives of another, is to be found in the funeral sermon\r\nof Frederick, Prince of Wales, and father of George III. The preacher,\r\nafter several judicious remarks on the virtues of the royal deceased,\r\nconcludes, \"That in the extreme to which these were carried, they\r\nappeared like vices; for so great was his generosity, that he ruined\r\nhalf the tradesmen in London; and so extraordinary his condescension,\r\nthat he kept all sorts of bad company.\"\r\n\r\nIt is strange, that while motives abstractly virtuous have produced\r\nlarge additions to the sum of mortal ills, little of private, and\r\nstill less of public, good has sprung, even casually, from those that\r\nare evil in themselves. \"If either the accounts of history, or the\r\ndaily reports of life, are to be at all credited,\" said one who had\r\nlearned and thought much on this subject, \"the greatest amount of\r\ncrime and folly has been committed from motives of religion and love,\r\nas men, for the most part, know them; while those of avarice, revenge,\r\nand fear, have originated the most extraordinary actions and important\r\nevents.\"\r\n\r\nThe sins of revenge have usually a leaven of what Bacon calls \"wild\r\njustice\" in them. Those of avarice are, from their very nature,\r\nnotorious; but perhaps no motive has ever prompted men to such varied\r\nand singular actions as that of fear. The working of fear was\r\nsingularly exhibited in the conduct of a certain Marquis of\r\nMontferrat, who lived at the period of the famous Italian wars, waged\r\nbetween Charles V. of Germany and Francis I. of France. The marquis\r\nwas an Alpine feudatory of the former, and served him long and\r\nfaithfully, till a German astrologer of high repute in those days\r\nassured him, from the stars, that the emperor would be eventually\r\noverthrown, and all his partisans utterly ruined. To avoid his\r\nprobable share in that prediction, the marquis turned traitor to his\r\nfriend and sovereign, for Charles had trusted him beyond most men; but\r\nthe next year, the emperor was completely victorious, by both sea and\r\nland. The marquis had fallen, fighting in vain for Francis, and his\r\nfief was bestowed on a loyal vassal of the emperor.\r\n\r\nDivines and philosophers have had many controversies concerning\r\nmotives. A great dispute on this subject is said to have engaged the\r\nlearned of Alexandria, about the accession of the emperor Julian,\r\nwhom, says a biographer, \"some of his subjects named the Apostate, and\r\nsome the Philosopher.\" The controversy occupied not only the Christian\r\nPlatonists, for whose numbers that city was so celebrated, but also\r\nthe Pagan wisdom, then shedding its last rays under favor of the new\r\nemperor. Yet neither Christians nor Pagans could entirely agree with\r\neach other, and such a division of opinion had never been heard, even\r\nin Alexandria. Things were in this state, says the tradition, when\r\nthere arrived in the capital of Egypt a Persian, whose fame had long\r\npreceded him. He had been one of the Magi, at the base of the\r\nCaucasus, till the Parthians laid waste his country, when he left it,\r\nand travelled over the world in search of knowledge, and, in both east\r\nand west, they called him Kosro the Wise. Scarce was the distinguished\r\nstranger fairly within their gates when the chiefs of the parties\r\ndetermined to hear his opinion on matter; and a deputation, consisting\r\nof a Christian bishop, a Jewish rabbi, a Platonist teacher, and a\r\npriest of Isis, waited on the Persian one morning, when he sat in the\r\nportico of a long-deserted temple, which some forgotten Egyptian had\r\nbuilt to Time, the instructor. The rabbi and the priest were for\r\nactions. The Platonist and the bishop were motive men, but in the\r\nmanner of those times, for even philosophy has its fashions, the four\r\nhad agreed that each should propose a question to Kosro, as his own\r\nwisdom dictated. Accordingly, after some preparatory compliments,\r\ntouching the extent of his fame and travels, the Platonist, who was\r\nalways notable for circumlocution, opened the business by inquiring\r\nwhat he considered the chief movers of mankind.\r\n\r\n\"Gain and vanity,\" replied Kosro.\r\n\r\n\"Which is strongest?\" interposed the rabbi, in whom the faculty of\r\nbeating about in argument was scarcely less developed.\r\n\r\n\"Gain was the first,\" said the Persian. \"Its worship succeeded the\r\nreign of Ormuz, which western poets call the golden age, and I know\r\nnot when it was; but, in later ages, vanity has become the most\r\npowerful, for every where I have seen men do that for glory which they\r\nwould not do for gain; and many even sacrifice gain to glory, as they\r\nthink it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, wise Kosro,\" demanded the priest, impatient with what he\r\nconsidered a needless digression, \"tell us your opinion--Should men be\r\njudged by their motives or their actions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Motives,\" said Kosro, \"are the province of divine, and actions of\r\nhuman, judgment. Nevertheless, because of the relation between them it\r\nis well to take note of the former when they become visible in our\r\nlight, yet not to search too narrowly after them, but take deeds for\r\ntheir value; seeing, first, that the inward labyrinth is beyond our\r\nexploring; secondly, that most men act from mingled motives; and,\r\nthirdly, that if, after the thought of a western poet, there were a\r\ncrystal pane set in each man's bosom, it would mightily change the\r\nestimation of many.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the bishop made answer--\"Kosro, thou hast seen the truth; man must\r\nat times perceive, but God alone can judge of, motives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Sharpe's London Journal.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAYS OF THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\nFROM THE FRENCH OF ALEX. DUMAS, BY MISS STRICKLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of an extensively organized conspiracy embittered the\r\nlast years of the Emperor Alexander, and increased his constitutional\r\nmelancholy. His attachment to Tzarsko Zelo made him linger longer at\r\nhis summer palace than was prudent in a man subject to erysipelas. The\r\nwound in his leg reopened with very unfavorable symptoms, and he was\r\ncompelled to leave his favorite residence in a closed litter for St.\r\nPetersburgh; and the skill and firmness of Mr. Wyllie, his Scotch\r\nsurgeon, alone saved the diseased limb from amputation. As soon as he\r\nwas cured, he returned again to Tzarsko Zelo, where the spring found\r\nhim as usual alone, without a court or chamberlain, only giving\r\naudience to his ministers twice a-week. His existence resembled rather\r\nthat of an anchorite weeping for the sins of his youth, than that of a\r\ngreat Emperor who makes the happiness of his people.\r\n\r\nHe regulated his time in the following manner:--in summer he rose at\r\nfive, and in winter at six o'clock every morning, and as soon as the\r\nduties of the toilette were ended, entered his cabinet, in which the\r\ngreatest order was observed. He found there a cambric handkerchief\r\nfolded, and a packet of new pens. He only used these pens in signing\r\nhis name, and never made use of them again. As soon as he concluded\r\nthis business, he descended into the garden, where, notwithstanding\r\nthe report of a conspiracy which had existed two years against his\r\nlife and government, he walked alone with no other guards than the\r\nsentinels always stationed before the palace of Alexander. At five he\r\nreturned, to dine alone, and after his solitary meal was lulled to\r\nsleep by the melancholy airs played by the military band of the guard\r\nregiment on duty. The selection of the music was always made by\r\nhimself, and he seemed to sink to repose, and to awake, with the same\r\nsombre dispositions and feelings which had been his companions\r\nthroughout the day.\r\n\r\nHis empress Elizabeth lived like her consort, in profound solitude,\r\nwatching over him like an invisible angel. Time had not extinguished\r\nin her heart the profound passion with which the youthful Czarowitz\r\nhad inspired her at first sight, and which she had preserved in her\r\nheart, pure and inviolate. His numerous and public infidelities could\r\nnot stifle this holy and beautiful attachment, which formed at once\r\nthe happiness and misery of a delicate and sensitive woman.\r\n\r\nAt this period of her life, the Empress at five-and-forty retained her\r\nfine shape and noble carriage, while her countenance showed the\r\nremains of considerable beauty, more impaired by sorrow than time.\r\nCalumny itself had never dared to aim her envenomed shafts at one so\r\neminently chaste and good. Her presence demanded the respect due to\r\nvirtue, still more than the homage proper to her elevated rank. She\r\nresembled indeed more an angel exiled from heaven, than the imperial\r\nconsort of a Prince who ruled a large portion of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1825, the last he was destined to see, the physicians\r\nof the Emperor unanimously recommended a journey to the Crimea, as the\r\nbest medicine he could take. Alexander appeared perfectly indifferent\r\nto a measure which regarded his individual benefit, but the Empress,\r\ndeeply interested in any event likely to restore her husband's health,\r\nasked and obtained permission to accompany him. The necessary\r\npreparations for this long absence overwhelmed the Emperor with\r\nbusiness, and for a fortnight he rose earlier, and went to bed later,\r\nthan was customary to him.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, no visible alteration was observed in his\r\nappearance, and he quitted St. Petersburgh, after a service had been\r\nchanted, to bring down a blessing from above on his journey. He was\r\naccompanied by the Empress, his faithful coachman, Ivan, and some\r\nofficers belonging to the staff of General Diebitch. He stopped at\r\nWarsaw a few days, in order to celebrate the birthday of his brother,\r\nthe Grand-Duke Constantine, and arrived at Tangaroff in the end of\r\nAugust 1825. Both the illustrious travellers found their health\r\nbenefitted by the change of scene and climate. Alexander took a great\r\nliking to Tangaroff, a small town on the borders of the sea of Azof,\r\ncomprizing a thousand ill-built houses, of which a sixth-part alone\r\nare of brick and stone, while the remainder resemble wooden cages\r\ncovered with dirt. The streets are large, but then they have no\r\npavement, and are alternately loaded with dust, or inundated with mud.\r\nThe dust rises in clouds, which conceals alike man and beast under a\r\nthick veil, and penetrates every where the carefully closed jalousies\r\nwith which the houses are guarded, and covers the garments of their\r\ninhabitants. The food, the water, are loaded with it; and the last\r\ncannot be drunk till previously boiled with salt of tartar, which\r\nprecipitates it; a precaution absolutely necessary to free it from\r\nthis disagreeable and dangerous deposit.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor took possession of the governor's house, where he\r\nsometimes slept and took his meals. His abode there in the daytime\r\nrarely exceeded two hours. The rest of his time was passed in\r\nwandering about the country on foot, in the hot dust or wet mud. No\r\nweather put any stop to his outdoor exercise, and no advice from his\r\nmedical attendant nor warning from the natives of Tangaroff, could\r\nprevail upon him to take the slightest precaution against the fatal\r\nautumnal fever of the country. His principal occupation was, planning\r\nand planting a great public garden, in which undertaking he was\r\nassisted by an Englishman whom he had brought with him to St.\r\nPetersburgh for that purpose. He frequently slept on the spot on a\r\ncamp-bed, with his head resting upon a leather pillow.\r\n\r\nIf general report may be credited, planting gardens was not the\r\nprincipal object that engrossed the Russian Emperor's attention. He\r\nwas said to be employed in framing a new Constitution for Russia, and\r\nunable to contend at St. Petersburgh with the prejudices of the\r\naristocracy, had retired to this small city, for the purpose of\r\nconferring this benefit upon his enslaved country.\r\n\r\nHowever this might be, the Emperor did not stay long at a time at\r\nTangaroff, where his Empress, unable to share with him the fatigues of\r\nhis long journeys, permanently resided, during his frequent absences\r\nfrom his head quarters. Alexander, in fact, made rapid excursions to\r\nthe country about the Don, and was sometimes at Tcherkask, sometimes\r\nat Donetz. He was on the eve of departure for Astracan, when Count\r\nWoronzoff in person came to announce to his sovereign the existence of\r\nthe mysterious conspiracy which had haunted him in St. Petersburgh,\r\nand which extended to the Crimea, where his personal presence could\r\nalone appease the general discontent.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of traversing three hundred leagues appeared a trifle to\r\nAlexander, whom rapid journeys alone diverted from his oppressive\r\nmelancholy. He announced to the Empress his departure, which he only\r\ndelayed till the return of a messenger he had sent to Alapka. The\r\nexpected courier brought new details of the conspiracy, which aimed at\r\nthe life, as well as the government of Alexander. This discovery\r\nagitated him terribly. He rested his aching head on his hands, gave a\r\ndeep groan, and exclaimed, \"Oh, my father, my father!\" Though it was\r\nthen midnight, he caused Count Diebitch to be roused from sleep and\r\nsummoned into his presence. The general, who lodged in the next house,\r\nfound his master in a dreadfully excited state, now traversing the\r\napartment with hasty strides, now throwing himself upon the bed with\r\ndeep sighs and convulsive starts. He at length became calm, and\r\ndiscussed the intelligence conveyed in the dispatches of Count\r\nWoronzoff. He then dictated two, one addressed to the Viceroy of\r\nPoland, the other to the Grand-Duke Nicholas.\r\n\r\nWith these documents all traces of his terrible agitation disappeared.\r\nHe was quite calm, and his countenance betrayed nothing of the emotion\r\nthat had harassed him the preceding night.\r\n\r\nCount Woronzoff, notwithstanding his apparent calmness, found him\r\ndifficult to please, and unusually irritable, for Alexander was\r\nconstitutionally sweet-tempered and patient. He did not delay his\r\njourney on account of this internal disquietude, but gave orders for\r\nhis departure from Tangaroff, which he fixed for the following day.\r\n\r\nHis ill-humor increased during the journey; he complained of the\r\nbadness of the roads and the slowness of the horses. He had never been\r\nknown to grumble before. His irritation became more apparent when Sir\r\nJames Wyllie, his confidential medical attendant, recommended him to\r\ntake some precaution against the frozen winds of the autumn; for he\r\nthrew away with a gesture of impatience the cloak and pelisse he\r\noffered, and braved the danger he had been entreated to avoid. His\r\nimprudence soon produced consequences. That evening he caught cold,\r\nand coughed incessantly, and the following day, on his arrival at\r\nOrieloff, an intermittent fever appeared, which soon after, aggravated\r\nby the obstinacy of the invalid, turned to the intermittent fever\r\ncommon to Tangaroff and its environs in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, whose increasing malady gave him a presage of his\r\napproaching death, expressed a wish to return to the Empress, and once\r\nmore took the route to Tangaroff; contrary to the prayers of Sir James\r\nWyllie, he chose to perform a part of the journey on horseback, but\r\nthe failure of his strength finally forced him to re-enter his\r\ncarriage. He entered Tangaroff on the fifth of November, and swooned\r\nthe moment he came into the governor's house. The Empress, who was\r\nsuffering with a complaint of the heart, forgot her malady, while\r\nwatching over her dying husband. Change of place only increased the\r\nfatal fever which preyed upon his frame, which seemed to gather\r\nstrength from day to day. On the eight, Wyllie called in Dr.\r\nStephiegen, and on the thirteenth they endeavored to counteract the\r\naffection of the brain, and wished to bleed the imperial patient. He\r\nwould not submit to the operation, and demanded iced water, which they\r\nrefused. Their denial irritated him, and he rejected every thing they\r\noffered him, with displeasure. These learned men were unwise, to\r\ndeprive the suffering prince of the water, a safe and harmless\r\nbeverage in such fevers. In fact, nature herself sometimes, in\r\ninspiring the wish, provides the remedy. The Emperor on the afternoon\r\nof that day wrote and sealed a letter, when perceiving the taper\r\nremained burning, he told his attendant to extinguish it, in words\r\nthat plainly expressed his feelings in regard to the dangerous nature\r\nof his malady. \"Put out that light, my friend, or the people will take\r\nit for a bier candle, and will suppose I am already dead.\"\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of November, the physicians again urged their\r\nrefractory patient to take the medicines they prescribed, and were\r\nseconded by the prayers of the Empress. He repulsed them with some\r\nhaughtiness, but quickly repenting of his hastiness of temper, which\r\nin fact was one of the symptoms of the disease, he said, \"Attend to\r\nme, Stephiegen, and you too, Sir Andrew Wyllie. I have much pleasure\r\nin seeing you, but you plague me so often about your medicine, that\r\nreally I must give up your company if you will talk of nothing else.\"\r\nHe however was at last induced to take a dose of calomel.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the fever had made such fearful progress that it\r\nappeared necessary to call in a priest. Sir Andrew Wyllie, at the\r\ninstance of the Empress, entered the chamber of the dying prince, and\r\napproaching his bed, with tears in his eyes advised him \"to call in\r\nthe aid of the Most High, and not to refuse the assistance of religion\r\nas he had already done that of medicine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor instantly gave his consent. Upon the fifteenth, at five\r\no'clock in the morning, a humble village priest approached the\r\nimperial bed to receive the confession of his expiring sovereign.--\"My\r\nfather, God must be merciful to kings,\" were the first words the\r\nEmperor addressed to the minister of religion; \"indeed they require it\r\nso much more than other men.\" In this sentence all the trials and\r\ntemptations of the despotic ruler of a great people--his territorial\r\nambition, his jealousy, his political ruses, his distrusts and\r\nover-confidences, seem to be briefly comprehended. Then, apparently\r\nperceiving some timidity in the spiritual confessor his destiny had\r\nprovided for him, he added, \"My father, treat me like an erring man,\r\nnot as an Emperor.\" The priest drew near the bed, received the\r\nconfession of his august penitent, and administered to him the last\r\nsacraments. Then having been informed of the Emperor's pertinacity in\r\nrejecting medicine, he urged him to give up this fatal obstinacy,\r\nremarking, \"that he feared God would consider it absolutely suicidal.\"\r\nHis admonitions made a deep impression upon the mind of the prince,\r\nwho recalled Sir Andrew Wyllie, and, giving him his hand, bade him do\r\nwhat he pleased with him. Wyllie took advantage of this absolute\r\nsurrender, to apply twenty leeches to the head of the Emperor; but the\r\napplication was too late, the burning fever continually increased, and\r\nthe sufferer was given over. The intelligence filled the dying chamber\r\nwith weeping domestics, who tenderly loved their master.\r\n\r\nThe Empress still occupied her place by the bed-side, which she had\r\nnever quitted but once, in order to allow her dying husband to unbosom\r\nhimself in private to his confessor. She returned to the post assigned\r\nher by conjugal tenderness directly the priest had quitted it.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after he had made his peace with God, Alexander experienced\r\nmore severe pain than he had yet felt. \"Kings,\" said he, \"suffer more\r\nthan others.\" He had called one of his attendants to listen to this\r\nremark with the air of one communicating a secret. He stopped, and\r\nthen, as if recalling something he had forgotten, said in a whisper,\r\n\"they have committed an infamous action.\" What did he mean by these\r\nwords? Was he suspicious that his days had been shortened by poison?\r\nor did he allude, with the last accents he uttered, to the barbarous\r\nassassination of the Emperor Paul? Eternity can alone reveal the\r\nsecret thoughts of Alexander I. of Russia.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, the dying prince lost consciousness. At two o'clock\r\nin the morning, Count Diebitch came to the Empress, to inform her that\r\nan old man, named Alexandrowitz, had saved many Tartars in the same\r\nmalady. A ray of hope entered the heart of the imperial consort at\r\nthis information, and Sir Andrew Wyllie ordered him to be sent for in\r\nhaste. This interval was passed by the Empress in prayer, yet she\r\nstill kept her eyes fixed upon those of her husband, watching with\r\nintense attention the beams of life and light fading in their\r\nunconscious gaze. At nine in the morning, the old man was brought into\r\nthe imperial chamber almost by force. The rank of the patient,\r\nperhaps, inspiring him with some fear respecting the consequences that\r\nmight follow his prescriptions, caused his extreme unwillingness. He\r\napproached the bed, looked at his dying sovereign, and shook his head.\r\nHe was questioned respecting this doubtful sign. \"It is too late to\r\ngive him medicine; besides, those I have cured were not sick of the\r\nsame malady.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words of the peasant physician, the last hopes of the\r\nEmpress vanished; but if pure and ardent prayers could have prevailed\r\nwith God, Alexander would have been saved.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of November, according to the usual method of\r\nmeasuring time, but on the first of December, if we follow the Russian\r\ncalendar, at fifty minutes after ten in the morning, Alexander\r\nPaulowitz, Emperor of all the Russias, expired. The Empress, bending\r\nover him, felt the departure of his last breath. She uttered a bitter\r\ncry, sank upon her knees, and prayed. After some minutes passed in\r\ncommunion with heaven, she rose, closed the eyes of her deceased lord,\r\ncomposed his features, kissed his cold and livid hands, and once more\r\nknelt and prayed. The physicians entreated her to leave the chamber of\r\ndeath, and the pious Empress consented to withdraw to her own.[9]\r\n\r\nThe body of the Emperor lay in state, on a platform raised in an\r\napartment of the house where he died. The presence-chamber was hung\r\nwith black, and the bier was covered with cloth of gold. A great many\r\nwax tapers lighted up the gloomy scene. A priest at the head of the\r\nbier prayed continually for the repose of his deceased sovereign's\r\nsoul. Two sentinels with drawn swords watched day and night beside the\r\ndead, two were stationed at the doors, and two stood on each step\r\nleading to the bier. Every person received at the door a lighted\r\ntaper, which he held while he remained in the apartment. The Empress\r\nwas present during these masses, but she always fainted at the\r\nconclusion of the service. Crowds of people united their prayers to\r\nhers, for the Emperor was adored by the common people. The corpse of\r\nAlexander I. lay in state twenty-one days before it was removed to the\r\nGreek monastery of St. Alexander, where it was to rest before its\r\ndeparture for interment in St. Petersburgh.\r\n\r\nUpon the 25th December, the remains of the Emperor were placed on a\r\nfuneral car drawn by eight horses, covered to the ground with black\r\ncloth ornamented with the escutcheons of the empire. The bier rested\r\non an elevated dais, carpeted with cloth of gold; over the bier was\r\nlaid a flag of silver tissue, charged with the heraldic insignia\r\nproper to the imperial house. The imperial crown was placed under the\r\ndais. Four major-generals held the cords which supported the diadem.\r\nThe persons composing the household of the Emperor and Empress\r\nfollowed the bier dressed in long black mantles, bearing in their\r\nhands lighted torches. The Cossacks of the Don every minute discharged\r\ntheir light artillery, while the sullen booming of the cannon added to\r\nthe solemnity of the imposing scene.\r\n\r\nUpon its arrival at the church, the body was transferred to a\r\ncatafalco covered with red cloth, surmounted by the imperial arms in\r\ngold, displayed on crimson-velvet. Two steps led up to the platform on\r\nwhich the catafalco was placed. Four columns supported the dais upon\r\nwhich the imperial crown, the sceptre, and the globe, rested.\r\n\r\nThe catafalco was surrounded by curtains of crimson velvet and cloth\r\nof gold, and four massy candelabra, at the four corners of the\r\nplatform, bore wax tapers sufficient to dispel the darkness, but not\r\nto banish the gloom pervading the church, which was hung with black\r\nembroidered with white crosses. The Empress made an attempt to assist\r\nat this funeral service, but her feelings overpowered her, and she was\r\nborne back to the palace in a swoon; but as soon as she came to\r\nherself she entered the private chapel, and repeated there the same\r\nprayers then reciting in the church of St. Alexander.\r\n\r\nWhile the remains of the Emperor Alexander were on their way to their\r\nlast home, the report of his dangerous state, which had been forwarded\r\nofficially to the Grand-Duke Nicholas, was contradicted by another\r\ndocument, which bore date of the 29th of November, announcing that\r\nconsiderable amendment had taken place in the Emperor's health, who\r\nhad recovered from a swoon of eight hours' duration, and had not only\r\nappeared collected, but declared himself improved in health.\r\n\r\nWhether this was a political ruse of the conspirators or the new\r\nEmperor remains quite uncertain; however, a solemn _Te Deum_ was\r\nordered to be celebrated in the cathedral of Casan, at which the\r\nEmpress Mother and the Grand-Dukes Nicholas and Michael were present.\r\nThe joyful crowds assembled at this service scarcely left the imperial\r\nfamily and their suite a free space for the exercise of their\r\ndevotions. Towards the end of the _Te Deum_, while the sweet voices of\r\nthe choir were rising in harmonious concert to heaven, some official\r\nperson informed the Grand-Duke Nicholas that a courier from Tangaroff\r\nhad arrived with the last dispatch, which he refused to deliver into\r\nany hand but his own. Nicholas was conducted into the sacristy, and\r\nwith one glance at the messenger divined the nature of the document of\r\nwhich he was the bearer. The letter he presented was sealed with\r\nblack. Nicholas recognized the handwriting of the Empress Consort,\r\nand, hastily opening it, read these words:\r\n\r\n\"Our angel is in heaven; I still exist on earth, but I hope soon to be\r\nre-united to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop was summoned into the sacristy by the new Emperor, who gave\r\nhim the letter, with directions to break the fatal tidings it\r\ncontained to the Empress Mother with the tenderest care. He then\r\nreturned to his place by the side of his august parent, who alone, of\r\nthe thousands assembled there, had perceived his absence.\r\n\r\nAn instant after, the venerable bishop re-entered the choir, and\r\nsilenced the notes of praise and exultation with a motion of his hand.\r\nEvery voice became mute, and the stillness of death reigned throughout\r\nthe sacred edifice. In the midst of the general astonishment and\r\nattention he walked slowly to the altar, took up the massy silver\r\ncrucifix which decorated it, and throwing over that symbol of earthly\r\nsorrow and divine hope a black veil, he approached the Empress Mother,\r\nand gave her the crucifix in mourning to kiss.\r\n\r\nThe Empress uttered a cry, and fell with her face on the\r\npavement;--she comprehended at once that her eldest son was dead.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Elizabeth soon realized the sorrowful hope she had\r\nexpressed. Four months after the death of her consort she died on the\r\nway from Tangaroff, at Beloff, and soon rejoined him she had\r\npathetically termed \"_her_ angel in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe historical career of the Emperor Alexander is well known to every\r\nreader, but the minor matters of every-day life mark the man, while\r\npublic details properly denote the sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe faults of Alexander are comprised in his infidelity to a\r\nbeautiful, accomplished, and affectionate wife. He respected her even\r\nwhile wounding her delicate feelings by his criminal attachments to\r\nother women. After many years of mental pain, the injured Elizabeth\r\ngave him the choice of giving her up, or banishing an imperious\r\nmistress, by whom the Emperor had a numerous family.\r\n\r\nAlexander could not resolve to separate for ever from his amiable and\r\nvirtuous consort,--he made the sacrifice she required of him.\r\n\r\nHis gallantry sometimes placed him in unprincely situations, and\r\nbrought him in contact with persons immeasurably beneath him. He once\r\nfell in love with a tailor's wife at Warsaw, and not being well\r\nacquainted with the character of the pretty grisette, construed her\r\nacceptance of the visit he proposed making her, into approbation of\r\nhis suit. The fair Pole was too simple, and had been too virtuously\r\nbrought up, to comprehend his intentions. Her husband was absent, so\r\nshe thought it would not be proper to receive the imperial visit\r\nalone; she made, therefore, a re-union of her own and her husband's\r\nrelations--rich people of the bourgeoisie class--and when the emperor\r\nentered her saloon, he found himself in company with thirty or forty\r\npersons, to whom he was immediately introduced by his fair and\r\ninnocent hostess. The astonished sovereign was obliged to make himself\r\nagreeable to the party, none of whom appeared to have divined his\r\ncriminal intentions. He made no further attempt to corrupt the\r\ninnocence of this beautiful woman, whose simplicity formed the\r\nsafeguard of her virtue.\r\n\r\nA severe trial separated him for ever from his last mistress, who had\r\nborne him a daughter; this child was the idol of his heart, and to\r\nform her mind was the pleasure of his life. At eighteen the young lady\r\neclipsed every woman in his empire by her dazzling beauty and graceful\r\nmanners. Suddenly she was seized with an infectious fever, for which\r\nno physician in St. Petersburgh could find a remedy. Her mother,\r\nselfish and timid, deserted the sick chamber of the suffering girl,\r\nover whom the bitter tears of a father were vainly shed, while he kept\r\nincessant vigils over one whom he would have saved from the power of\r\nthe grave at the expense of his life and empire. The dying daughter\r\nasked incessantly for her mother, upon whose bosom she desired to\r\nbreathe her last sigh; but neither the passionate entreaties nor the\r\ncommands of her imperial lover could induce the unnatural parent to\r\nrisk her health by granting the interview for which her poor child\r\ncraved, and she expired in the arms of her father, without the\r\nconsolation of bidding her mother a last adieu.\r\n\r\nSome days after the death of his natural daughter, the Emperor\r\nAlexander entered the house of an English officer to whom he was much\r\nattached. He was in deep mourning and appeared very unhappy. \"I have\r\njust followed to the grave,\" said he, \"as a private person the remains\r\nof my poor child, and I cannot yet forgive the unnatural woman who\r\ndeserted the death-bed of her daughter. Besides, my sin, which I never\r\nrepented of, has found me out, and the vengeance of God has fallen\r\nupon its fruits. Yes, I deserted the best and most amiable of wives,\r\nthe object of my first affection, for women who neither possessed her\r\nbeauty nor merit. I have preferred to the Empress even this unnatural\r\nmother, whom I now regard with loathing and horror. My wife shall\r\nnever again have cause to reproach my broken faith.\"\r\n\r\nDevotion and his strict adherence to his promise balmed the wound,\r\nwhich, however, only death could heal. To the secret agony which\r\nthrough life had haunted the bosom of the son was added that of the\r\nfather, and the return of Alexander to the paths of virtue and\r\nreligion originated in the loss of this beloved daughter, smitten, he\r\nconsidered, for his sins.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of this prince for Madam Krudener had nothing criminal\r\nin its nature, though it furnished a theme for scandal to those who\r\nare apt to doubt the purity of Platonic attachments between\r\nindividuals of opposite sexes.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this Emperor's political career, full of ambition and\r\nstratagem, we can only re-echo his dying words to his confessor:--\"God\r\nmust be merciful to kings?\" His career, however varied by losses on\r\nthe field or humiliated by treaties, ended triumphantly with the\r\nlaurels of war and the olives of peace, and he bore to his far\r\nnorthern empire the keys of Paris as a trophy of his arms. His\r\nmoderation demands the praise of posterity, and excited the admiration\r\nof the French nation at large.[10] His immoral conduct as a man and a\r\nhusband was afterwards effaced by his sincere repentance, and he died\r\nin the arms of the most faithful and affectionate of wives, who could\r\nnot long survive her irreparable loss. His death was deeply lamented\r\nby his subjects, who, if they did not enrol his name among the\r\ngreatest of their rulers, never have hesitated to denote him as the\r\nbest and most merciful sovereign who ever sat upon the Russian throne.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] The autopsy exhibited the same appearance generally discovered in those\r\nsubjects whose death has been caused by the fever of the country: the brain\r\nwas watery, the veins of the head were gorged, and the liver was soft. No\r\nsigns of poison were discovered; the death of the Emperor was in the course\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\n[10] The French authorities would have removed the trophies of Napoleon's\r\nvictories, and the commemoration of the Russian share in the disastrous\r\ndays of Jena and Austerlitz. The Emperor Alexander magnanimously replied,\r\n\"No, let them remain: it is sufficient that I have passed over the bridge\r\nwith my army!\" A noble and generous reply. Few princes have effaced public\r\nwrongs so completely, or used their opportunity of making reprisals so\r\nmercifully. (See Chateaubriand's Autobiography.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFALLEN GENIUS.\r\n\r\nBY MISS ALICE CAREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    No tears for him!--he saw by faith sublime\r\n      Through the wan shimmer of life's wasted flame,\r\n    Across the green hills of the future time,\r\n      The golden breaking of the morn of fame.\r\n\r\n    Faded by the diviner life, and worn,\r\n      The dust has fallen away, and ye but see\r\n    The ruins of the house wherein were borne\r\n      The birth-pangs of an immortality.\r\n\r\n    His great life from the wondrous life to be,\r\n      Clasped the bright splendors that no sorrow mars,\r\n    As some pale, shifting column of the sea,\r\n      Mirrors the awful beauty of the stars.\r\n\r\n    What was Love's lily pressure, what the light\r\n      Of its pleased smile, that a chance breath may chill?\r\n    His soul was mated with the winds of night,\r\n      And wandered through the universe at will.\r\n\r\n    Oft in his heart its stormy passion woke,\r\n      Yet from its bent his soul no more was stirred,\r\n    Than is the broad green bosom of the oak\r\n      By the light flutter of the summer bird.\r\n\r\n    His loves were of forbidden realms, unwrought\r\n      In poet's rhyme, the music of his themes,\r\n    Hovering about the watch-fires of his thought,\r\n      On the dim borders of the land of dreams.\r\n\r\n    For while his hand with daring energy\r\n      Fed the slow fire that, burning, must consume,\r\n    The ravishing joys of unheard harmony\r\n      Beat like a living pulse within the tomb.\r\n\r\n    Pillars of fire that wander through life's night,\r\n      Children of genius! ye are doomed to be,\r\n    In the embrace of your far-reaching light,\r\n      Locking the radiance of eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Times.\r\n\r\nCOPENHAGEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA more stately city than Copenhagen can scarcely be imagined. The\r\nstreets, wide and long, filled with spacious and lofty houses of\r\nunspotted whiteness, and built with great regularity, remind one\r\nsomewhat of Bath, but that the ground is level; many of them\r\nall but equal, in breadth, to the Irishman's test of street\r\narchitecture--Sackville-street, Dublin. But large squares break up\r\ntheir continuous lines, and the eye rests on fine statues, noble\r\npalaces, and splendid buildings devoted to the arts, to amusement, to\r\njustice, or to the purposes of religion in every quarter of the city.\r\nCopenhagen is but a creation of the last century, and, after a little\r\ntime spent there, a large portion of it gives the idea that it was\r\nbuilt all of a sudden, by some Danish Grissell and Peto, according to\r\ncontract. Surrounded by a deep foss, by ramparts and intrenchments,\r\ndefended by formidable forts and batteries, filled with the halls of\r\nkings, with churches, museums, and castles, it combines the appearance\r\nof a new cut made by the royal commissioners through some old London\r\nrookery, with the air of an old feudal town. The moat prohibits any\r\nconsiderable extension. Seen under a bright cold sky, the blanched\r\nfronts of the houses, the white walls of the public edifices, the\r\nregularity of the streets, conveyed an impression of cleanliness,\r\nwhich could only be destroyed when one happened to look down at his\r\nfeet, or ceased to keep guard over his nose. The paving is of the\r\nstyle which may be called Titanic, and was never intended for any foot\r\ngarb less defensive than a _sabot_ or a _caliga_. The drainage is\r\nsuperficial,--that is, all the liquid refuse of the city runs, or\r\nrather walks very leisurely, along grooves in the pavement aforesaid,\r\nwhich are covered over by boards in various stages of decomposition.\r\nIn summer, the city must be worse than Berlin (which, by the by, it\r\nvery much resembles in many respects). In spring time, after rain, my\r\nown experience tells me it suggests forcible reminiscences of the\r\nantique odors of Fleet Ditch. One thing which soon strikes the\r\nstranger is the apparent want of shops. But they are to be found by\r\nthose who want them. Nearly every trader carries on his business very\r\nmodestly in his front parlor, and makes a moderate display of his\r\nstock in the ordinary window, so that the illusory and enchanting\r\ndepartment of trade is quite gone. A Danish gentleman can walk out\r\nwith his wife without the least fear that he will fall a victim to \"a\r\nstupendous sacrifice,\" or be immolated on the altar of \"an imperative\r\nnecessity to clear out in a week.\"\r\n\r\nMoving through these streets is a quiet, soberly-attired population.\r\nBigger than most foreigners, and with great roundness of muscle and\r\nsize of bone, your Dane wants the dapper air of the Frenchman, or the\r\nsolemnity of the Spaniard, while he is not so bearded or so dirty as\r\nthe German. But then he smokes prodigiously, dresses moderately in the\r\nEnglish style, is addicted to jewelry in excess, and has a habit of\r\nplodding along, straight in the middle of the road, with his head\r\ndown, which must be a matter of considerable annoyance to the native\r\ncabman. He is, however, amazingly polite. He not only takes off his\r\nhat to every one he knows, but gives any lady-acquaintance the trouble\r\nof recognizing him, by bowing to her before she has made up her mind\r\nwhether the individual is known or not. Another of his peculiarities\r\nis, that he always has a dog. I should say, more correctly, there is\r\nalways a dog following him,--for I have seen an animal, which seemed\r\nto be bound by the closest ties to a particular gentleman, placidly\r\nleave him at the corner of a street, and set off on an independent\r\nwalk by itself. These dogs are, in fact, a feature of the place by\r\nthemselves. In number they can only be excelled by the canine\r\nscavengers of Cairo or Constantinople, and in mongrelness and ugliness\r\nby no place in the world--not even in Tuum before the potato rot. They\r\nget up little extemporary hunts through the squares, the trail being\r\ngenerally the remnant of an old rat, carried away by the foremost, and\r\ndash between your legs from unexpected apertures in walls and houses,\r\nso as to cause very unpleasant consequences to the nervous or feeble\r\nsojourner. On seeking for an explanation of their great abundance, I\r\nwas informed that they were kept to kill rats. But this is a mere\r\ndelusion. These dogs are far too wise to lose their health by keeping\r\nlate hours in pursuit of vermin. No, they retire as soon as darkness\r\nsets in, and with darkness, out come the rats in the most perfect\r\nsecurity. Such rats! they are as big as kittens, and their squeaking\r\nunder the wooden planks of the gutters as you walk home is perfectly\r\namazing. The celebrated dog Billy would have died in a week of violent\r\nexercise in any one street in Copenhagen, giving him his usual\r\nallowance of murder. I must say that, in the matters of paving, dogs,\r\nrats, sewers, water, and lights, Copenhagen is rather behind the rest\r\nof the world. As to the lights, they are sparely placed, and as yet\r\ngas is not used. With a laudable economy, the oil-wicks are\r\nextinguished when the moon shines, and the result is, that sometimes\r\nan envious cloud leaves the whole city in Cimmerian darkness for the\r\nrest of the night, in consequence of five minutes' moonshine in the\r\nearly part, as, once put out, they are not again relumed.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd you meet many pale, sorrow-stricken women in mourning,\r\nand now and then a poor soldier limps before you, with recent bandages\r\non his stump, or hobbles along limpingly, with perhaps a sabre-cut\r\nacross the face, or an empty coat-sleeve dangling from his shoulder;\r\nand then you remember all the horrors the late war must have caused\r\nDenmark, when, out of her small population, 90,000 men were under arms\r\nin the field. It can scarcely atone for this sight to meet dashing\r\nhussars, with their red coats and sheepskin calpacks; heavy dragoons\r\nin light-blue and dark-green; jagers in smart frocks of olive-green,\r\ndecorated with stars and ribands, and swaggering along in all the\r\npride of having smelt powder and done their duty. They are numerous\r\nenough, indeed every third man is a soldier; but one of these sad\r\nwidows or orphans is an antidote to the glories of these fine heroes,\r\nscarcely less powerful than that of the spectacle of their mutilated\r\nand mangled comrades. This war has roused the national spirit of\r\nDenmark; it has caused her to make a powerful effort to shake off all\r\nconnection with Germany, or dependence on her Germanic subjects, but\r\nit has cost her L5,000,000 of money, and it has left many a home\r\ndesolate for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nTHE SHADOW OF LUCY HUTCHINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some books that leave upon the mind a strange impression,\r\none of the most delightful reading can produce--a haunting of the\r\nmemory, it may be, by one form or by several, strangely real, having a\r\npositive personal presence and identity, yet always preserving an\r\nimmaterial existence, and occupying a \"removed ground,\" from which\r\nthey never stir to mingle with the realities of recollection. These\r\nshadows hold their place apart, as some rare dreams do, claiming from\r\nus an indescribable tenderness.\r\n\r\nThe \"Memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson\" is such a book. In many passages\r\nit is tedious--a record of petty strategies of partisan warfare--and,\r\nmore dreary still, of factious jealousies and polemical hatreds. The\r\nabsolute truth of the book is fatal, in one direction to our\r\nhero-worship. The leaders of the Great Rebellion, in such minute\r\ndetails, appear as mere schemers, as rival agents at a borough\r\nelection; and the most fervent in professions of religious zeal are as\r\nbitter in their revenges as the heroes of a hundred scalps; but there\r\narises out of the book, and is evermore associated with it, the calm\r\nquiet shadow of a woman of exquisite purity, of wondrous constancy, of\r\nuntiring affection--Lucy Hutchinson, its writer.\r\n\r\nJohn Hutchinson is at Richmond, lodging at the house of his\r\nmusic-master. He is twenty-two years of age. The village is full of\r\n\"good company,\" for the young Princes are being educated in the\r\npalace, and many \"ingenious persons entertained themselves at that\r\nplace.\" The music-master's house is the resort of the king's\r\nmusicians; \"and divers of the gentlemen and ladies that were affected\r\nwith music came thither to hear.\" There was a little girl \"tabled\" in\r\nthe same house with John Hutchinson, who was taking lessons of the\r\nlutanist--a charming child, full of vivacity and intelligence. She\r\ntold John she had an elder sister--a studious and retiring person--who\r\nwas gone with her mother, Lady Apsley, into Wiltshire--and Lucy was\r\ngoing to be married, she thought. The little girl ever talked of\r\nLucy--and the gentlemen talked of Lucy--and one day a song was sung\r\nwhich Lucy had written--and John and the vivacious child walked,\r\nanother day, to Lady Apsley's house, and there, in a closet, were\r\nLucy's Latin books. Mr. Hutchinson grew in love with Lucy's image; and\r\nwhen the talk was more rife that she was about to be married--and some\r\nsaid that she was indeed married--he became unhappy--and \"began to\r\nbelieve there was some magic in the place, which enchanted men out of\r\ntheir right senses; but the sick heart could not be chid nor advised\r\ninto health.\" At length Lucy and her mother came home; and Lucy was\r\nnot married. Then John and Lucy wandered by the pleasant banks of the\r\nThames, in that spring-time of 1638, and a \"mutual friendship\" grew up\r\nbetween them. Lucy now talked to him of her early life; how she had\r\nbeen born in the Tower of London, of which her late father, Sir John\r\nApsley, was the governor; how her mother was the benefactress of the\r\nprisoners, and delighted to mitigate the hard fortune of the noble and\r\nthe learned, and especially Sir Walter Raleigh, by every needful help\r\nto his studies and amusements; how she herself grew serious amongst\r\nthese scenes, and delighted in nothing but reading, and would never\r\npractise her lute or harpsichords, and absolutely hated her needle.\r\nJohn was of a like serious temper. Their fate was determined.\r\n\r\nThe spring is far advanced into summer. On a certain day the friends\r\non both sides meet to conclude the terms of the marriage. Lucy is not\r\nto be seen. She has taken the small-pox. She is very near death. At\r\nlength John is permitted to speak to his betrothed. Tremblingly and\r\nmournfully she comes into his presence. She is \"the most deformed\r\nperson that could be seen.\" Who could tell the result in words so\r\ntouching as Lucy's own? \"He was nothing troubled at it, but married\r\nher as soon as she was able to quit the chamber, when the priest and\r\nall that saw her were affrighted to look on her. But God recompensed\r\nhis justice and constancy by restoring her; though she was longer than\r\nordinary before she recovered to be as well as before.\"\r\n\r\nThey were married on the 3d of July, 1638.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1641, John and Lucy Hutchinson are living in their\r\nown house of Owthorpe, in Nottinghamshire. They have two sons. They\r\nare \"peaceful and happy.\" John has dedicated two years since his\r\nmarriage to the study of \"school divinity.\" He has convinced himself\r\nof \"the great point of predestination.\" This faith has not, as his\r\nwife records, produced a \"carelessness of life in him,\" but \"a more\r\nstrict and holy walking.\" He applies himself, in his house at\r\nOwthorpe, \"to understand the things then in dispute\" between the King\r\nand Parliament. He is satisfied of the righteousness of the\r\nParliament's cause; but he then \"contents himself with praying for\r\npeace.\" In another year the King has set up his standard in\r\nNottingham; the battle of Edgehill has been fought; all hope of peace\r\nis at an end. John Hutchinson is forced out of his quiet habitation by\r\nthe suspicions of his royalist neighbors. He is marked as a Roundhead.\r\nLucy does not like the name. \"It was very ill applied to Mr.\r\nHutchinson, who having naturally a very fine thick-set head of hair,\r\nkept it clean and handsome, so that it was a great ornament to him;\r\nalthough the godly of those days, when he embraced their party, would\r\nnot allow him to be religious because his hair is not in their cut.\"\r\nThe divinity student now becomes a lieutenant-colonel. He raises a\r\ncompany of \"very honest godly men.\" The Earl of Chesterfield is\r\nplundering the houses of the Puritans in the vale of Belvoir, near\r\nOwthorpe; and the young colonel has apprehensions for the safety of\r\nhis family. In the depth of winter, a troop of horse arrive one night\r\nat the lonely house where Lucy and her children abide. They are\r\nhastily summoned to prepare for an instant journey. They are to ride\r\nto Nottingham before sunrise, for the soldiers are not strong enough\r\nto march in the day. Lucy is henceforth to be the companion of her\r\nhusband in his perilous office--his friend, his comforter--a\r\nministering angel amongst the fierce and dangerous spirits, whom he\r\nsways by a remarkable union of courage and gentleness.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the shadow of Lucy Hutchinson. She tranquilly sits in\r\none of the upper chambers of the old and ruinous castle of which her\r\nhusband is appointed governor. It is a summer evening of 1643. In that\r\ntower, built upon the top of the rock, tradition says that Queen\r\nIsabel received her paramour Mortimer; and at the base of the rock are\r\nstill shown Mortimer's Well, and Mortimer's Hole, as Lady Hutchinson\r\nsaw them two centuries ago. She looks out of the narrow windows by\r\nwhich her chamber is lighted. There is the Trent, peacefully flowing\r\non one side, amid flat meadows. On the other is the town of\r\nNottingham. The governor has made the ruinous castle a strong\r\nfortress, with which he can defy the Cavaliers should they occupy the\r\ntown beneath. Opposite the towers is the old church of St. Nicholas,\r\nwhose steeple commands the platform of the castle. The Governor has\r\nsent away his horse, and many of his foot, to guard the roads by which\r\nthe enemy could approach Nottingham. There is no appearance of danger.\r\nThe reveille is beat. Those who have been watching all night lounge\r\ninto the town. It is in the possession of the Cavaliers. The scene is\r\nchanged. The din of ordnance rouses Lucy from her calm gaze upon the\r\nwindings of the Trent. For five days and nights there is firing\r\nwithout intermission. Within the walls of the castle there are not\r\nmore than eighty men. The musketeers on St. Nicholas steeple pick off\r\nthe cannoniers at their guns.\r\n\r\nNow and then, as the assailants are beaten from the walls, they leave\r\na wounded man behind, and he is dragged into the castle. On the sixth\r\nday, after that terrible period of watchfulness, relief arrives. The\r\nCavaliers are driven from the town with much slaughter, and the castle\r\nis filled with prisoners. Lucy has been idle during those six days of\r\nperil. There was a task to be performed,--a fitting one for woman's\r\ntenderness. Within the castle was a dungeon called the Lion's Den,\r\ninto which the prisoners were cast; and as they were brought up from\r\nthe town, two of the fanatical ministers of the garrison reviled and\r\nmaltreated them. Lucy reads the commands of her Master after another\r\nfashion. As the prisoners are carried bleeding to the Lion's Den, she\r\nimplores that they should be brought in to her, and she binds up and\r\ndresses their wounds. And now the two ministers mutter--and their\r\nsouls abhor to see this favor done to the enemies of God--and they\r\nteach the soldiers to mutter. But Lucy says, \"I have done nothing but\r\nmy duty. These are our enemies, but they are our fellow-creatures. Am\r\nI to be upbraided for these poor humanities?\" And then she breathes a\r\nthanksgiving to Heaven that her mother had taught her this humble\r\nsurgery. There is a tear in John's eye as he gazes on this scene. That\r\nnight the Cavalier officers sup with him, rather as guests than as\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the vale of Belvoir, about seven miles from Belvoir Castle, is the\r\nlittle village of Owthorpe. When Colonel Hutchinson returned to the\r\nhouse of his fathers, after the war was ended, he found it plundered\r\nof all its movables--a mere ruin. In a few years it is a fit dwelling\r\nfor Lucy to enjoy a lifelong rest, after the terrible storms of her\r\nearly married days. There is no accusing spirit to disturb their\r\nrepose. John looks back upon that solemn moment when he signed the\r\nwarrant for the great tragedy enacted before Whitehall without\r\nremorse. He had prayed for \"an enlightened conscience,\" and he had\r\ncarried out his most serious convictions. He took no part in the\r\ndespotic acts that followed the destruction of the monarchy. He had no\r\naffection for the fanatics who held religion to be incompatible with\r\ninnocent pleasures and tasteful pursuits. At Owthorpe, then, he lived\r\nthe true life of an English gentleman. He built--he planted--he\r\nadorned his house with works of art--he was the first magistrate--the\r\nbenefactor of the poor. The earnest man who daily expounded the\r\nScriptures to his household was no ascetic. There was hospitality\r\nwithin those walls--with music and revelry. The Puritans looked\r\ngloomily and suspiciously upon the dwellers at Owthorpe. The Cavaliers\r\ncould not forgive the soldier who had held Nottingham Castle against\r\nall assaults.\r\n\r\nThe Restoration comes. The royalist connexions of Lucy Hutchinson have\r\na long struggle to save her husband's life; but he is finally included\r\nin the Act of Oblivion. He is once more at Owthorpe, without the\r\ncompromise of his principles. He has done with political strife for\r\never.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October 1663, there is a coach waiting before the hall\r\nof Owthorpe. That hall is filled with tenants and laborers. Their\r\nbenefactor cheerfully bids them farewell; but his wife and children\r\nare weeping bitterly. That coach is soon on its way to London with the\r\nhusband and wife, and their eldest son and daughter. At the end of the\r\nfourth day's journey, at the gates of that fortress within which she\r\nhad been born, Lucy Hutchinson is parted from him whose good and evil\r\nfortunes she had shared for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from Deal stands Sandown Castle. In 1664, Colonel\r\nHutchinson is a prisoner within its walls. It was a ruinous place, not\r\nweatherproof. The tide washed the dilapidated fortress; the windows\r\nwere unglazed; cold, and damp, and dreary was the room where the proud\r\nheart bore up against physical evils. For even here there was\r\nhappiness. Lucy is not permitted to share his prison; but she may\r\nvisit him daily. In the town of Deal abides that faithful wife. She is\r\nwith him at the first hour of the morning; she remains till the latest\r\nof night. In sunshine or in storm, she is pacing along that rugged\r\nbeach, to console and be consoled.\r\n\r\nEleven months have thus passed, when Lucy is persuaded by her husband\r\nto go to Owthorpe to see her children.\r\n\r\n\"When the time of her departure came, she left with a very sad and\r\nill-presaging heart.\" In a few weeks John Hutchinson is laid in the\r\nfamily vault in that Vale of Belvoir.\r\n\r\nLucy Hutchinson sits in holy resignation in the old sacred home. She\r\nhas a task to work out. She has to tell her husband's history, for the\r\ninstruction of her children:--\"I that am under a command not to grieve\r\nat the common rate of desolate women, while I am studying which way to\r\nmoderate my woe, and, if it were possible, to augment my love, can,\r\nfor the present, find out none more just to your dear father, nor\r\nconsolatory to myself, than the preservation of his memory.\"\r\n\r\nSo rests her shadow, ever, in our poor remembrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Eliza Cook's Journal.\r\n\r\nTHE WIVES OF SOUTHEY, COLERIDGE, AND LOVELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthey, Coleridge, and Lovell, three poets, married three sisters,\r\nthe Misses Fricker of Bristol. They were all alike poor when they\r\nmarried. Southey's aunt shut her door in his face when she found he\r\nwas resolved on marrying in such circumstances; and he, postponing\r\nentry upon the married life, though he had contracted the\r\nresponsibility of husband, parted from his wife at the church door,\r\nand set out on a six months' visit to Portugal, preparatory to\r\nentering on the study of the legal profession. Southey committed his\r\nmaiden wife to the care of Mr. Cottle's sisters during his absence.\r\n\"Should I perish by shipwreck,\" he wrote from Falmouth to Mr. Cottle,\r\n\"or by any other casualty, I have relations whose prejudice will yield\r\nto the anguish of affection, and who will love, cherish, and give all\r\npossible consolation to my widow.\" With these words Southey set sail\r\nfor Portugal, and his wife, who had persuaded him to go, and cried\r\nwhen he was going, though she would not then have permitted him to\r\nstay, meekly retired to her place of refuge, wearing her wedding-ring\r\nround her neck.\r\n\r\nSouthey returned to England, and commenced the study of the law, but\r\nafter a year's drudgery gave it up. His wife joined him in a second\r\nvisit to Portugal, and on his return he commenced the laborious\r\nliterary career which he pursued till his death. He enjoyed on the\r\nwhole a happy married life; took pleasure in his home and his family;\r\nloving his children and his wife Edith dearly. This is one of his own\r\npictures:--\"Glance into the little room where sits the gray-haired\r\nman, 'working hard and getting little--a bare maintenance, and hardly\r\nthat; writing poems and history for posterity with his whole heart and\r\nsoul; one daily progressing in learning, not so learned as he is\r\npoor, not so poor as proud, not so proud as happy.'\" Great men have\r\ninvited him to London, and he is now answering the invitation. The\r\nthought of the journey plagues him. \"Oh dear, oh dear!\" he writes,\r\n\"there is such a comfort in one's old coat and old shoes, one's own\r\nchair and own fireside, one's own writing-desk and own library--with a\r\nlittle girl climbing up to my neck and saying, 'Don't go to London,\r\npapa, you must stay with Edith'--and a little boy whom I have taught\r\nto speak the language of cats, dogs, cuckoos, jackasses, &c., before\r\nhe can articulate a word of his own--there is such a comfort in all\r\nthese things, that _transportation_ to London seems a heavier\r\npunishment than any sins of mine deserve.\" But a sad calamity fell\r\nupon him in his old age. His dear Edith was suddenly bereft of reason.\r\n\"Forty years,\" he writes to Grosvenor Bedford from York, \"has she been\r\nthe life of my life--and I have left her this day in a lunatic\r\nasylum.\" In the same letter he expresses the resignation of a\r\nChristian and the confident courage of a man. \"God, who has visited me\r\nwith this affliction,\" he says, \"has given me strength to bear it, and\r\nwill, _I know_, support me to the end, whatever that may be. To-morrow\r\nI return to my poor children. I have much to be thankful for under\r\nthis visitation. For the first time in my life (he was sixty years\r\nold) I am so far beforehand with the world that my means are provided\r\nfor the whole of next year, and that I can meet this expenditure,\r\nconsiderable in itself, without any difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Southey, after two years' absence, returned to Keswick, the\r\nfamily home, and closed her pitiable existence there. Southey was now\r\na broken-down man. \"There is no one,\" he mournfully writes, \"to\r\npartake with me the recollections of the best and happiest portion of\r\nmy life; and for that reason, were there no other, such recollections\r\nmust henceforth be purely painful, except when I collect them with the\r\nprospects of futurity.\" Two years after, however, Southey married\r\nagain: the marriage was one of respect on the part of Caroline Bowles,\r\nthe gifted authoress, who was his choice, and probably of convenience\r\nand friendship on the part of Southey. We have heard that the union\r\ngreatly tended to his comfort, and that his wife tenderly soothed and\r\ncheered his declining years.\r\n\r\nSouthey, in addition to maintaining his own wife and family at Keswick\r\nby his literary labors, had the families of his two sisters-in-law\r\noccasionally thrown upon his hands. He was not two-and-twenty when Mr.\r\nLovell, who married his wife's sister, fell ill of fever, died, and\r\nleft his widow and child without the slightest provision. Robert\r\nSouthey took mother and child at once to his humble hearth, and there\r\nthe former found happiness until his death. Coleridge, not\r\nsufficiently instructed by a genius to which his contemporaries did\r\nhomage, in a wayward and unpardonable mood withdrew himself from the\r\nconsolations of home; and in their hour of desertion his wife and\r\nchildren were saved half the knowledge of their hardships by finding a\r\nsecond husband and another father in the sanctuary provided for them\r\nby Robert Southey.\r\n\r\nColeridge was unpunctual, unbusiness-like, improvident, and dreamy, to\r\nthe full extent to which poets are said proverbially to be. When he\r\nmarried--his pantisocratic Owenite scheme having just been exploded,\r\nand his lectures at Bristol having proved a failure--he retired with\r\nSara Fricker, his wife, to a cottage at Clevedon, near Bristol. Though\r\nthe cottage was a poor one, consisting of little more than four bare\r\nwalls, for which he paid only L5 annual rental, he and his wife made\r\nit pretty snug with the aid of the funds supplied by their constant\r\nfriend, Mr. Cottle, the Bristol bookseller. Coleridge decorated this\r\ncottage with all the graces that his imagination and fancy could throw\r\naround it. It is alluded to in many of his poems:--\r\n\r\n    \"Low was our pretty cot! our tallest rose\r\n    Peep'd at the chamber window. We could hear\r\n    At silent noon, and eve, and early morn,\r\n    The sea's faint murmur. In the open air\r\n    Our myrtles blossom'd, and across the porch\r\n    Thick jasmines twin'd: the little landscape round\r\n    Was green and woody, and refreshed the eye.\r\n    It was a spot which you might aptly call\r\n    The valley of seclusion.\"\r\n\r\nBut his loved young wife was not forgotten; for again he sings:--\r\n\r\n    \"My pensive Sara! thy soft cheek reclin'd\r\n    Thus on mine arm, most soothing sweet it is\r\n    To sit beside our cot--our cot o'ergrown\r\n    With white-flowered jasmine, and the broad leav'd myrtle\r\n    (Meet emblems they of innocence and love!)\r\n    And watch the clouds, that late were rich with light,\r\n    Slow saddening round, and mark the star of eve,\r\n    Serenely brilliant (such should wisdom be!)\r\n    Shine opposite.\"\r\n\r\nHere their first child was born--Hartley, the dreamer--on whom the\r\nhappy parent shed tears of joy:--\r\n\r\n    \"But when I saw it on its mother's arm,\r\n    And hanging at her bosom (she the while\r\n    Bent o'er its features with a tearful smile,)\r\n    Then I was thrill'd and melted, and most warm\r\n    Impress'd a father's kiss; and all beguil'd\r\n    Of dark remembrance and presageful fear,\r\n    I seem'd to see an angel's form appear--\r\n    'Twas even thine, beloved woman mild!\r\n    So for the mother's sake the child was dear,\r\n    And dearer was the mother for the child.\"\r\n\r\nBut writing poetry, reading Hartley and Condillac, would not make the\r\npoet's pot boil at all briskly, and so he had to go a little nearer to\r\nthe world, and went back to Bristol. Coleridge, however, wanted\r\napplication, and could scarcely be induced to work, even though the\r\nprospect of liberal remuneration was offered to him. Hence, a few\r\nyears after marriage, in July, 1796, we find him thus groaning in the\r\nspirit to a friend: \"It is my duty and business to thank God for all\r\nhis dispensations, and to believe them the best possible; but, indeed,\r\nI think I should have been more thankful if He had made me a\r\njourneyman shoemaker, instead of an author, by trade. I have left my\r\nfriends, I have left plenty,\" &c. \"So I am forced to write for bread!\r\nwith the nights of poetic enthusiasm, when every minute I am hearing a\r\ngroan from my wife--groans, and complaints, and sickness! The present\r\nhour I am in a quickset of embarrassments, and whichever way I turn, a\r\nthorn runs into me! The future is a cloud and thick darkness! Poverty,\r\nperhaps, and the thin faces of them that want bread looking up to me,\"\r\n&c. This was not the kind of spirit to make a wife happy--very\r\ndifferent indeed from the manly, courageous, and self-helping\r\nSouthey--and the poor wife suffered much. Whatever Coleridge touched\r\nfailed: his fourpenny paper, the _Watchman_, was an abortion; and the\r\nverses he wrote for a London paper did little for him. He next\r\npreached for a short time among the Unitarians, deriving a very\r\nprecarious living from that source; when at length the Messrs.\r\nWedgwood, struck by his great talents, granted him an annuity of L150\r\nto enable him to devote himself to study. Then he went to Germany,\r\nleaving his wife and little family to the hospitality of Southey; and\r\nreturned and settled down to the precarious life of a writer for the\r\nnewspapers: his eloquent conversation producing unbounded admiration,\r\nbut very little \"grist.\" He was often distressed for money, wasting\r\nwhat he had by indulgence in opium, to which he was at one time a\r\nfearful victim. The great and unquestionable genius of Coleridge was\r\nexpended chiefly on projections. He was a man who was capable of\r\ngreatly adorning the literature of his time, and of creating an\r\naltogether new era in its history; but he could not or would not work,\r\nand his life was passed in dreamy idleness, in self-inflicted poverty,\r\noften in poignant misery, in gloomy regrets, and in unfulfilled\r\ndesigns. We fear the life of Mrs. Coleridge was not a happy one, good\r\nand affectionate though she was as a wife and mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL: OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.[11]\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeonard and Helen settled themselves in two little chambers in a small\r\nlane. The neighborhood was dull enough--the accommodation humble; but\r\ntheir landlady had a smile. That was the reason, perhaps, why Helen\r\nchose the lodgings; a smile is not always found on the face of a\r\nlandlady when the lodger is poor. And out of their windows they caught\r\nsight of a green tree, an elm, that grew up fair and tall in a\r\ncarpenter's yard at the rear. That tree was like another smile to the\r\nplace. They saw the birds come and go to its shelter; and they even\r\nheard, when a breeze arose, the pleasant murmur of its boughs.\r\n\r\nLeonard went the same evening to Captain Digby's old lodgings, but he\r\ncould learn there no intelligence of friends or protectors for Helen.\r\nThe people were rude and sturdy, and said that the Captain still owed\r\nthem L1 17s. The claim, however, seemed very disputable; and was\r\nstoutly denied by Helen. The next morning Leonard set off in search of\r\nDr. Morgan. He thought his best plan was to inquire the address of the\r\nDoctor at the nearest chemist's, and the chemist civilly looked into\r\nthe _Court Guide_, and referred him to a house in Bulstrode-street,\r\nManchester Square. To this street Leonard contrived to find his way,\r\nmuch marvelling at the meanness of London. Screwstone seemed to him\r\nthe handsomest town of the two.\r\n\r\nA shabby man-servant opened the door, and Leonard remarked that the\r\nnarrow passage was choked with boxes, trunks, and various articles of\r\nfurniture. He was shown into a small room, containing a very large\r\nround table, whereon were sundry works on homoeopathy, Parry's\r\n_Cymbrian Plutarch_, Davies' _Celtic Researches_, and a Sunday\r\nnewspaper. An engraved portrait of the illustrious Hahnemann occupied\r\nthe place of honor over the chimneypiece. In a few minutes the door to\r\nan inner room opened, and Dr. Morgan appeared, and said politely,\r\n\"Come in, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor seated himself at a desk, looked hastily at Leonard, and\r\nthen at a great chronometer lying on the table. \"My time's short,\r\nsir--going abroad; and now that I am going, patients flock to me. Too\r\nlate. London will repent its apathy. Let it!\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor paused majestically, and, not remarking on Leonard's face\r\nthe consternation he had anticipated, he repeated peevishly--\"I am\r\ngoing abroad, sir, but I will make a synopsis of your case, and leave\r\nit to my successor. Hum! Hair chestnut; eyes--what color? Look this\r\nway--blue,--dark blue. Hem! Constitution nervous. What are the\r\nsymptoms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" began Leonard, \"a little girl--\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan_, (impatiently)--\"Little girl! Never mind the history of\r\nyour sufferings; stick to the symptoms--stick to the symptoms.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"You mistake me, Doctor; I have nothing the matter with\r\nme. A little girl--\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"Girl again! I understand it! it is she who is ill.\r\nShall I go to her? she must describe her own symptoms--I can't judge\r\nfrom your talk. You'll be telling me she has consumption, or\r\ndyspepsia, or some such disease that don't exist: mere allopathic\r\ninventions--symptoms, sir, symptoms.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard_, (forcing his way)--\"You attended her poor father, Captain\r\nDigby, when he was taken ill in the coach with you. He is dead, and\r\nhis child is an orphan.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan_, (fumbling in his medical pocket-book.)--\"Orphan!\r\nnothing for orphans, especially if inconsolable, like _aconite_ and\r\n_chamomilla_.\"[12]\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty Leonard succeeded in bringing Helen to the\r\nrecollection of the homoeopathist, stating how he came in charge of\r\nher, and why he sought Dr. Morgan.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was much moved.\r\n\r\n\"But really,\" said he after a pause, \"I don't see how I can help the\r\npoor child. I know nothing of her relations. This Lord Les--whatever\r\nhis name is--I know of no lords in London. I knew lords, and physicked\r\nthem too, when I was a blundering allopathist. There was the Earl of\r\nLansmere--has had many a blue pill from me, sinner that I was. His son\r\nwas wiser; never would take physic. Very clever boy was Lord\r\nL'Estrange--I don't know if he was as good as he was clever--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord L'Estrange!--that name begins with Les--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff! He's always abroad--shows his sense. I'm going abroad too. No\r\ndevelopment for science in this horrid city; full of prejudices, sir,\r\nand given up to the most barbarous allopathical and phlebotomical\r\npropensities. I am going to the land of Hahnemann, sir--sold my\r\ngood-will, lease, and furniture, and have bought in on the Rhine.\r\nNatural life there, sir--homoeopathy needs nature; dine at one\r\no'clock, get up at four--tea little known, and science appreciated.\r\nBut I forget. Cott! what can I do for the orphan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said Leonard rising, \"Heaven will give me strength to\r\nsupport her.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at the young man attentively. \"And yet,\" said he in\r\na gentler voice, \"you, young man, are, by your account, a perfect\r\nstranger to her, or were so when you undertook to bring her to London.\r\nYou have a good heart--always keep it. Very healthy thing, sir, a good\r\nheart--that is, when not carried to excess. But you have friends of\r\nyour own in town?\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"Not yet, sir; I hope to make them.\"\r\n\r\n_Doctor._--\"Bless me, you do? How? I can't make any.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard colored and hung his head. He longed to say \"Authors find\r\nfriends in their readers--I am going to be an author.\" But he felt\r\nthat the reply would savor of presumption, and held his tongue.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor continued to examine him, and with friendly interest. \"You\r\nsay you walked up to London--was that from choice or economy?\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"Both, sir.\"\r\n\r\n_Doctor._--\"Sit down again and let us talk. I can give you a quarter\r\nof an hour, and I'll see if I can help either of you, provided you\r\ntell all the symptoms--I mean all the particulars.\"\r\n\r\nThen with that peculiar adroitness which belongs to experience in the\r\nmedical profession, Dr. Morgan, who was really an acute and able man,\r\nproceeded to put his questions, and soon extracted from Leonard the\r\nboy's history and hopes. But when the Doctor, in admiration at a\r\nsimplicity which contrasted so evident an intelligence, finally asked\r\nhim his name and connections, and Leonard told them, the\r\nhomoeopathist actually started. \"Leonard Fairfield, grandson of my\r\nold friend, John Avenel of Lansmere! I must shake you by the hand.\r\nBrought up by Mrs. Fairfield!--Ah, now I look, strong family\r\nlikeness--very strong!\"\r\n\r\nThe tears stood in the Doctor's eyes. \"Poor Nora!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Nora! Did you know my aunt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your aunt! Ah--ah! yes--yes! Poor Norah!--she died almost in these\r\narms--so young, so beautiful. I remember it as of yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor brushed his hand across his eyes, and swallowed a globule;\r\nand, before the boy knew what he was about, had in his benevolence\r\nthrust another between Leonard's quivering lips.\r\n\r\nA knock was heard at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! that's my great patient,\" cried the Doctor, recovering his\r\nself-possession--\"must see him. A chronic case--excellent\r\npatient--tic, sir, tic. Puzzling and interesting. If I could take that\r\ntic with me, I should ask nothing more from Heaven. Call again on\r\nMonday; I may have something to tell you then as to yourself. The\r\nlittle girl can't stay with you--wrong and nonsensical. I will see\r\nafter her. Leave me your address--write it here. I think I know a lady\r\nwho will take charge of her. Good-bye. Monday next, ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nWith this, the Doctor thrust out Leonard, and ushered in his grand\r\npatient, whom he was very anxious to take with him to the banks of the\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\nLeonard had now only to discover the nobleman whose name had been so\r\nvaguely uttered by poor Captain Digby. He had again recourse to the\r\n_Court Guide_; and finding the address of two or three lords the first\r\nsyllables of whose titles seemed similar to that repeated to him, and\r\nall living pretty near to each other, in the regions of May Fair, he\r\nascertained his way to that quarter, and, exercising his mother-wit,\r\ninquired at the neighboring shops as to the personal appearance of\r\nthese noblemen. Out of consideration for his rusticity, he got very\r\ncivil and clear answers; but none of the lords in question\r\ncorresponded with the description given by Helen. One was old, another\r\nwas exceedingly corpulent, a third was bed-ridden--none of them was\r\nknown to keep a great dog. It is needless to say that the name of\r\nL'Estrange (no habitant of London) was not in the _Court Guide_. And\r\nDr. Morgan's assertion that that person was always abroad, unluckily\r\ndismissed from Leonard's mind the name the homoeopathist had so\r\ncasually mentioned. But Helen was not disappointed when her young\r\nprotector returned late in the day and told her of his ill success.\r\nPoor child! she was so pleased in her heart not to be separated from\r\nher new brother; and Leonard was touched to how she had contrived, in\r\nhis absence, to give a certain comfort and cheerful grace to the bare\r\nroom devoted to himself. She had arranged his few books and papers so\r\nneatly, near the window, in sight of the one green elm. She had coaxed\r\nthe smiling landlady out of one or two extra articles of furniture,\r\nespecially a walnut-tree bureau, and some odds and ends of\r\nribbon--with which last she had looped up the curtains. Even the old\r\nrush-bottom chairs had a strange air of elegance, from the mode in\r\nwhich they were placed. The fairies had given sweet Helen the art that\r\nadorns a home, and brings out a smile from the dingiest corner of hut\r\nand attic.\r\n\r\nLeonard wondered and praised. He kissed his blushing ministrant\r\ngratefully, and they sat down in joy to their abstemious meal, when\r\nsuddenly his face was overclouded--there shot through him the\r\nremembrance of Dr. Morgan's words--\"The little girl can't stay with\r\nyou--wrong and nonsensical. I think I know a lady who will take charge\r\nof her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" cried Leonard, sorrowfully, \"how could I forget?\" And he told\r\nHelen what grieved him. Helen at first exclaimed that she would not\r\ngo. Leonard, rejoiced, then began to talk as usual of his great\r\nprospects; and, hastily finishing his meal, as if there were no time\r\nto lose, sat down at once to his papers. Then Helen contemplated him\r\nsadly, as he bent over his delighted work. And when, lifting his\r\nradiant eyes from his MS. he exclaimed, \"No, no, you shall _not_ go.\r\n_This_ must succeed, and we shall live together in some pretty\r\ncottage, where we can see more than one tree\"--_then_ Helen sighed,\r\nand did not answer this time, \"No, I will not go.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after she stole from the room, and into her own; and there,\r\nkneeling down, she prayed, and her prayer was somewhat this--\"Guard me\r\nagainst my own selfish heart. May I never be a burden to him who has\r\nshielded me.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps, as the Creator looks down on this world, whose wondrous\r\nbeauty beams on us more and more, in proportion as our science would\r\ntake it from poetry into law--perhaps He beholds nothing so beautiful\r\nas the pure heart of a simple loving child.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nLeonard went out the next day with his precious MSS. He had read\r\nsufficient of modern literature to know the names of the principal\r\nLondon publishers; and to these he took his way with a bold step,\r\nthough a beating heart.\r\n\r\nThat day he was out longer than the last; and when he returned, and\r\ncame into the little room, Helen uttered a cry, for she scarcely\r\nrecognised him. There was on his face so deep, so concentrated a\r\ndespondency. He sat down listlessly, and did not kiss her this time,\r\nas she stole towards him. He felt so humbled. He was a king deposed.\r\n_He_ take charge of another life! He!\r\n\r\nShe coaxed him at last into communicating his day's chronicle. The\r\nreader beforehand knows too well what it must be, to need detailed\r\nrepetition. Most of the publishers had absolutely refused to look at\r\nhis MSS.; one or two had good-naturedly glanced over and returned them\r\nat once, with a civil word or two of flat rejection. One publisher\r\nalone--himself a man of letters, and who in youth had gone through the\r\nsame bitter process of dis-illusion that now awaited the village\r\ngenius--volunteered some kindly though stern explanation and counsel\r\nto the unhappy boy. This gentleman read a portion of Leonard's\r\nprincipal poem with attention, and even with frank admiration. He\r\ncould appreciate the rare promise that it manifested. He sympathized\r\nwith the boy's history, and even with his hopes; and then he said, in\r\nbidding him farewell--\r\n\r\n\"If I publish this poem for you, speaking as a trader, I shall be a\r\nconsiderable loser. Did I publish all that I admire, out of sympathy\r\nwith the author, I should be a ruined man. But suppose that, impressed\r\nas I really am with the evidence of no common poetic gifts in this\r\nMS., I publish it, not as a trader, but a lover of literature, I shall\r\nin reality, I fear, render you a great disservice, and perhaps unfit\r\nyour whole life for the exertions on which you must rely for\r\nindependence.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, sir?\" cried Leonard--\"Not that I would ask you to injure\r\nyourself for me,\" he added with proud tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"How, my young friend? I will explain. There is enough talent in these\r\nverses to induce very flattering reviews in some of the literary\r\njournals. You will read these, find yourself proclaimed a poet, will\r\ncry 'I am on the road to fame.' You will come to me, 'And my poem, how\r\ndoes it sell?' I shall point to some groaning shelf, and say, 'not\r\ntwenty copies!' The journals may praise, but the public will not buy\r\nit. 'But you will have got a name,' you say. Yes, a name as a poet\r\njust sufficiently known to make every man in practical business\r\ndisinclined to give fair trial to your talents in a single department\r\nof positive life;--none like to employ poets;--a name that will not\r\nput a penny in your purse--worse still, that will operate as a barrier\r\nagainst every escape into the ways whereby men get to fortune. But,\r\nhaving once tasted praise, you will continue to sigh for it: you will\r\nperhaps never again get a publisher to bring forth a poem, but you\r\nwill hanker round the purlieus of the muses, scribble for periodicals,\r\nfall at last into a bookseller's drudge. Profits will be so precarious\r\nand uncertain, that to avoid debt may be impossible; then, you who now\r\nseem so ingenuous and so proud, will sink deeper still into the\r\nliterary mendicant--begging, borrowing--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never--never--never!\" cried Leonard, veiling his face with his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Such would have been my career,\" continued the publisher. \"But I\r\nluckily had a rich relative, a trader, whose calling I despised as a\r\nboy, who kindly forgave my folly, bound me as an apprentice, and here\r\nI am; and now I can afford to write books as well as sell them.\r\n\r\n\"Young man, you must have respectable relations--go by their advice\r\nand counsel; cling fast to some positive calling. Be any thing in this\r\ncity rather than poet by profession.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how, sir, have there ever been poets? Had _they_ other callings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Read their biography, and then envy them!\"\r\n\r\nLeonard was silent a moment; but, lifting his head, answered loud and\r\nquickly,--\"I _have_ read their biography. True, their lot\r\npoverty--perhaps hunger. Sir, I envy them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poverty and hunger are small evils,\" answered the bookseller, with a\r\ngrave kind smile. \"There are worse,--debt and degradation,\r\nand--despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, no--you exaggerate; these last are not the lot of all\r\npoets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, for most of our greatest poets had some private means of their\r\nown. And for others, why, all who have put into a lottery have not\r\ndrawn blanks. But who could advise another man to set his whole hope\r\nof fortune on the chance of a prize in a lottery? And such a lottery!\"\r\ngroaned the publisher, glancing towards sheets and reams of dead\r\nauthors lying like lead upon his shelves.\r\n\r\nLeonard clutched his MSS. to his heart, and hurried away.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he muttered, as Helen clung to him and tried to console--\"yes,\r\nyou were right: London is very vast, very strong, and very cruel;\" and\r\nhis head sank lower and lower yet upon his bosom.\r\n\r\nThe door was flung widely open, and in, unannounced, walked Dr Morgan.\r\n\r\nThe child turned to him, and at the sight of his face she remembered\r\nher father; and the tears that, for Leonard's sake, she had been\r\ntrying to suppress, found way.\r\n\r\nThe good Doctor soon gained all the confidence of these two young\r\nhearts. And, after listening to Leonard's story of his paradise lost\r\nin a day, he patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Well, you will call\r\non me on Monday, and we will see. Meanwhile, borrow these of me,\"--and\r\nhe tried to slip three sovereigns into the boy's hand. Leonard was\r\nindignant. The bookseller's warning flashed on him. Mendicancy! Oh no,\r\nhe had not yet come to that! He was almost rude and savage in his\r\nrejection; and the Doctor did not like him the less for it.\r\n\r\n\"You are an obstinate mule,\" said the homoeopathist, reluctantly\r\nputting up his sovereigns. \"Will you work at something practical and\r\nprosy, and let the poetry rest awhile?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Leonard doggedly, \"I will work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then. I know an honest bookseller, and he shall give you\r\nsome employment; and meanwhile, at all events, you will be among\r\nbooks, and that will be some comfort.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard's eyes brightened--\"A great comfort, sir.\" He pressed the hand\r\nhe had before put aside to his grateful heart.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" resumed the Doctor seriously, \"you really feel a strong\r\npredisposition to make verses?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very bad symptom indeed, and must be stopped before a relapse! Here,\r\nI have cured three prophets and ten poets with this novel specific.\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus speaking, he had got out his book and a globule. \"_Agaricus\r\nmuscarius_ dissolved in a tumbler of distilled water--tea-spoonful\r\nwhenever the fit comes on. Sir, it would have cured Milton himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now for you, my child,\" turning to Helen--\"I have found a lady\r\nwho will be very kind to you. Not a menial situation. She wants some\r\none to read to her and tend on her--she is old and has no children.\r\nShe wants a companion, and prefers a girl of your age to one older.\r\nWill this suit you?\"\r\n\r\nLeonard walked away.\r\n\r\nHelen got close to the Doctor's ear, and whispered, \"No, I cannot\r\nleave _him_ now--he is so sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cott!\" grunted the Doctor, \"you two must have been reading _Paul and\r\nVirginia_. If I could but stay in England, I would try what _ignatia_\r\nwould do in this case--interesting experiment! Listen to me--little\r\ngirl; and go out of the room, you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard, averting his face, obeyed. Helen made an involuntary step\r\nafter him--the Doctor detained and drew her on his knee.\r\n\r\n\"What is your Christian name?--I forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"Helen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Helen, listen. In a year or two you will be a young woman, and it\r\nwould be very wrong then to live alone with that young man. Meanwhile,\r\nyou have no right to cripple all his energies. He must not have you\r\nleaning on his right arm--you would weigh it down. I am going away,\r\nand when I am gone there will be no one to help you, if you reject the\r\nfriend I offer you. Do as I tell you, for a little girl so peculiarly\r\nsusceptible (a thorough _pulsatilla_ constitution) cannot be\r\nobstinate and egotistical.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see him cared for and happy, sir,\" said she firmly, \"and I\r\nwill go where you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall be so; and to-morrow, while he is out, I will come and fetch\r\nyou. Nothing so painful as leave-taking--shakes the nervous system,\r\nand is a mere waste of the animal economy.\"\r\n\r\nHelen sobbed aloud; then, writhing from the Doctor, she exclaimed,\r\n\"But he may know where I am? We may see each other sometimes? Ah, sir,\r\nit was at my father's grave that we first met, and I think Heaven sent\r\nhim to me. Do not part us for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have a heart of stone if I did,\" cried the Doctor\r\nvehemently, \"and Miss Starke shall let him come and visit you once a\r\nweek. I'll give her something to make her. She is naturally\r\nindifferent to others. I will alter her whole constitution, and melt\r\nher into sympathy--with _rhododendron_ and _arsenic_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nBefore he went, the Doctor wrote a line to Mr. Prickett, bookseller,\r\nHolborn, and told Leonard to take it, the next morning, as addressed.\r\n\"I will call on Prickett myself to-night, and prepare him for your\r\nvisit. And I hope and trust you will only have to stay there a few\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\nHe then turned the conversation, to communicate his plans for Helen.\r\nMiss Starke lived at Highgate--a worthy woman, stiff and prim, as old\r\nmaids sometimes are. But just the place for a little girl like Helen,\r\nand Leonard should certainly be allowed to call and see her.\r\n\r\nLeonard listened and made no opposition; now that his day-dream was\r\ndispelled, he had no right to pretend to be Helen's protector. He\r\ncould have bade her share his wealth and his fame; his penury and his\r\ndrudgery--no.\r\n\r\nIt was a very sorrowful evening--that between the adventurer and the\r\nchild. They sat up late, till their candle had burned down to the\r\nsocket; neither did they talk much; but his hand clasped hers all the\r\ntime, and her head pillowed itself on his shoulder. I fear, when they\r\nparted, it was not for sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd when Leonard went forth the next morning, Helen stood at the\r\nstreet door, watching him depart--slowly, slowly. No doubt, in that\r\nhumble lane there were many sad hearts; but no heart so heavy as that\r\nof the still quiet child, when the form she had watched was to be seen\r\nno more, and, still standing on the desolate threshold, she gazed into\r\nspace--and all was vacant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMr. Prickett was a believer in homoeopathy, and declared, to the\r\nindignation of all the apothecaries round Holborn, that he had been\r\ncured of a chronic rheumatism by Dr. Morgan. The good Doctor had, as\r\nhe promised, seen Mr. Prickett when he left Leonard, and asked him as\r\na favor to find some light occupation for the boy, that would serve as\r\nan excuse for a modest weekly salary. \"It will not be for long,\" said\r\nthe Doctor; \"his relations are respectable and well off. I will write\r\nto his grandparents, and in a few days I hope to relieve you of the\r\ncharge. Of course, if you don't want him, I will repay what he costs\r\nmeanwhile.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Prickett, thus prepared for Leonard, received him very graciously,\r\nand, after a few questions, said Leonard was just the person he wanted\r\nto assist him in cataloguing his books, and offered him most\r\nhandsomely L1 a-week for the task.\r\n\r\nPlunged at once into a world of books vaster than he had ever before\r\nwon admission to, that old divine dream of knowledge, out of which\r\npoetry had sprung, returned to the village student at the very sight\r\nof the venerable volumes. The collection of Mr. Prickett was, however,\r\nin reality by no means large; but it comprised not only the ordinary\r\nstandard works, but several curious and rare ones. And Leonard paused\r\nin making the catalogue, and took many a hasty snatch of the contents\r\nof each tome, as it passed through his hands. The bookseller, who was\r\nan enthusiast for old books, was pleased to see a kindred feeling\r\n(which his shop-boy had never exhibited) in his new assistant; and he\r\ntalked about rare editions and scarce copies, and initiated Leonard in\r\nmany of the mysteries of the bibliographist.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more dark and dingy than the shop. There was a booth\r\noutside, containing cheap books and odd volumes, round which there was\r\nalways an attentive group; within, a gas-lamp burned night and day.\r\n\r\nBut time passed quickly to Leonard. He missed not the green fields, he\r\nforgot his disappointments, he ceased to remember even Helen. O\r\nstrange passion of knowledge! nothing like thee for strength and\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nMr. Prickett was a bachelor, and asked Leonard to dine with him on a\r\ncold shoulder of mutton. During dinner the shop-boy kept the shop, and\r\nMr. Prickett was really pleasant as well as loquacious. He took a\r\nliking to Leonard--and Leonard told him his adventures with the\r\npublishers, at which Mr. Prickett rubbed his hands and laughed as at a\r\ncapital joke. \"Oh give up poetry, and stick to a shop,\" cried he;\r\n\"and, to cure you for ever of the mad whim to be an author, I'll just\r\nlend you the _Life and Works of Chatterton_. You may take it home with\r\nyou and read before you go to bed. You'll come back quite a new man\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nNot till night, when the shop was closed, did Leonard return to his\r\nlodging. And when he entered the room, he was struck to the soul by\r\nthe silence, by the void. Helen was gone!\r\n\r\nThere was a rose-tree in its pot on the table at which he wrote, and\r\nby it a scrap of paper, on which was written--\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear Brother Leonard, God bless you. I will let you know when\r\nwe can meet again. Take care of this rose, Brother, and don't forget\r\npoor\r\n\r\n           HELEN.\"\r\n\r\nOver the word \"forget\" there was a big round blistered spot that\r\nnearly effaced the word.\r\n\r\nLeonard leant his face on his hands, and for the first time in his\r\nlife he felt what solitude really is. He could not stay long in the\r\nroom. He walked out again, and wandered objectless to and fro the\r\nstreets. He passed that stiller and humbler neighborhood, he mixed\r\nwith the throng that swarmed in the more populous thoroughfares.\r\nHundreds and thousands passed him by, and still--still such solitude.\r\n\r\nHe came back, lighted his candle, and resolutely drew forth the\r\n\"Chatterton\" which the bookseller had lent him. It was an old\r\nedition in one thick volume. It had evidently belonged to some\r\ncontemporary of the Poet's--apparently an inhabitant of\r\nBristol--some one who had gathered up many anecdotes respecting\r\nChatterton's habits, and who appeared even to have seen him, nay, been\r\nin his company; for the book was interleaved, and the leaves covered with\r\nnotes and remarks in a stiff clear hand--all evincing personal knowledge\r\nof the mournful immortal dead. At first,Leonard read with an effort; then\r\nthe strange and fierce spell of that dread life seized upon him--seized\r\nwith pain, and gloom, and terror--this boy dying by his own hand, about\r\nthe age Leonard had attained himself. This wondrous boy, of a genius beyond\r\nall comparison--the greatest that ever yet was developed and extinguished\r\nat the age of eighteen--self-taught--self-struggling--self-immolated.\r\nNothing in literature like that life and that death!\r\n\r\nWith intense interest Leonard perused the tale of the brilliant\r\nimposture, which had been so harshly and so absurdly construed into\r\nthe crime of a forgery, and which was (if not wholly innocent) so akin\r\nto the literary devices always in other cases viewed with indulgence,\r\nand exhibiting, in this, intellectual qualities in themselves so\r\namazing--such patience, such forethought, such labor, such courage,\r\nsuch ingenuity--the qualities that, well directed, make men great, not\r\nonly in books, but action. And, turning from the history of the\r\nimposture to the poems themselves, the young reader bent before their\r\nbeauty, literally awed and breathless. How had this strange Bristol\r\nboy tamed and mastered his rude and motley materials into a music that\r\ncomprehended every tune and key, from the simplest to the sublimest?\r\nHe turned back to the biography--he read on--he saw the proud, daring,\r\nmournful spirit, alone in the Great City like himself. He followed its\r\ndismal career, he saw it falling with bruised and soiled wings into\r\nthe mire. He turned again to the later works, wrung forth as tasks for\r\nbread,--the satires without moral grandeur, the politics without\r\nhonest faith. He shuddered and sickened as he read. True, even here\r\nhis poet mind appreciated (what perhaps only poets can) the divine\r\nfire that burned fitfully through that meaner and more sordid fuel--he\r\nstill traced in those crude, hasty, bitter offerings to dire\r\nNecessity, the hand of the young giant who had built up the stately\r\nverse of Rowley. But, alas! how different from that \"mighty line.\" How\r\nall serenity and joy had fled from these later exercises of art\r\ndegraded into journey-work. Then rapidly came on the catastrophe--the\r\nclosed doors--the poison--the suicide--the manuscripts torn by the\r\nhands of despairing wrath, and strewed round the corpse upon the\r\nfuneral floors. It was terrible! The spectre of the Titan boy, (as\r\ndescribed in the notes written on the margin,) with his haughty brow,\r\nhis cynic smile, his lustrous eyes, haunted all the night the baffled\r\nand solitary child of song.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nIt will often happen that what ought to turn the human mind from some\r\npeculiar tendency produces the opposite effect. One would think that\r\nthe perusal in the newspaper of some crime and capital punishment\r\nwould warn away all who had ever meditated the crime, or dreaded the\r\nchance of detection. Yet it is well known to us that many a criminal\r\nis made by pondering over the fate of some predecessor in guilt. There\r\nis a fascination in the Dark and Forbidden, which, strange to say, is\r\nonly lost in fiction. No man is more inclined to murder his nephews,\r\nor stifle his wife, after reading Richard the Third or Othello. It is\r\nthe _reality_ that is necessary to constitute the danger of contagion.\r\nNow, it was this reality in the fate, and life, and crowning suicide\r\nof Chatterton, that forced itself upon Leonard's thoughts, and sat\r\nthere like a visible evil thing, gathering evil like cloud around it.\r\nThere was much in the dead poet's character, his trials, and his doom,\r\nthat stood out to Leonard like a bold and colossal shadow of himself\r\nand his fate. Alas! the bookseller, in one respect, had said truly.\r\nLeonard came back to him the next day a new man, and it seemed even to\r\nhimself as if he had lost a good angel in losing Helen. \"Oh that she\r\nhad been by my side,\" thought he. \"Oh that I could have felt the touch\r\nof her confiding hand--that, looking up from the scathed and dreary\r\nruin of this life, that had sublimely lifted itself from the plain,\r\nand sought to tower aloft from a deluge, her mild look had spoken to\r\nme of innocent, humble, unaspiring childhood! Ah! If indeed I were\r\nstill necessary to her--still the sole guardian and protector--then\r\ncould I say to myself, 'Thou must not despair and die! Thou hast her\r\nto live and to strive for.' But no, no! Only this vast and terrible\r\nLondon--the solitude of the dreary garret, and those lustrous eyes\r\nglaring alike through the throng and through the solitude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday, Dr. Morgan's shabby man-servant opened the\r\ndoor to a young man in whom he did not at first remember a former\r\nvisitor. A few days before, embrowned with healthful travel--serene\r\nlight in his eye, simple trust in his careless lip--Leonard Fairfield\r\nhad stood at that threshold. Now again he stood there pale and\r\nhaggard, with a cheek already hollowed into those deep anxious lines\r\nthat speak of working thoughts and sleepless nights; and a settled\r\nsullen gloom resting heavily on his whole aspect.\r\n\r\n\"I call by appointment,\" said the boy testily, as the servant stood\r\nirresolute. The man gave way. \"Master is just called out to a patient;\r\nplease to wait, sir;\" and he showed him into the little parlor. In a\r\nfew moments two other patients were admitted. These were women, and\r\nthey began talking very loud. They disturbed Leonard's unsocial\r\nthoughts. He saw that the door into the Doctor's receiving-room was\r\nhalf open, and, ignorant of the etiquette which holds such\r\n_penetralia_ as sacred, he walked in to escape from the gossips. He\r\nthrew himself into the Doctor's own well-worn chair, and muttered to\r\nhimself, \"Why did he tell me to come? What new can he think of for me?\r\nAnd if a favor, should I take it? He has given me the means of bread\r\nby work: that is all I have a right to ask from him, from any man--all\r\nI should accept.\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus soliloquizing, his eye fell on a letter lying open on the\r\ntable. He started. He recognized the handwriting--the same as the\r\nletter which had enclosed L50 to his mother--the letter of his\r\ngrandparents. He saw his own name: he saw something more--words that\r\nmade his heart stand still, and his blood seem like ice in his veins.\r\nAs he thus stood aghast, a hand was laid on the letter, and a voice,\r\nin an angry growl, muttered, \"How dare you come into my room, and be\r\nreading my letters? Er--r--r!\"\r\n\r\nLeonard placed his own hand on the Doctor's firmly, and said in a\r\nfierce tone, \"This letter relates to me--belongs to me--crushes me. I\r\nhave seen enough to know that. I demand to read all--learn all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor looked round, and seeing the door into the waiting-room\r\nstill open, kicked it to with his foot, and then said, under his\r\nbreath, \"What have you read? Tell me the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two lines only, and I am called--I am called\"--Leonard's frame shook\r\nfrom head to foot, and the veins on his forehead swelled like cords.\r\nHe could not complete the sentence. It seemed as if an ocean was\r\nrolling up through his brain, and roaring in his ears. The Doctor saw,\r\nat a glance, that there was physical danger in his state, and hastily\r\nand soothingly answered,--\"Sit down, sit down--calm yourself--you\r\nshall know all--read all--drink this water;\" and he poured into a\r\ntumbler of the pure liquid a drop or two from a tiny phial.\r\n\r\nLeonard obeyed mechanically, for indeed he was no longer able to\r\nstand. He closed his eyes, and for a minute or two life seemed to pass\r\nfrom him; then he recovered, and saw the good Doctor's gaze fixed on\r\nhim with great compassion. He silently stretched forth his hand\r\ntowards the letter. \"Wait a few moments,\" said the physician\r\njudiciously, \"and hear me meanwhile. It is very unfortunate you should\r\nhave seen a letter never meant for your eye, and containing allusions\r\nto a secret you were never to have known. But, if I tell you more,\r\nwill you promise me, on your word of honor, that you will hold the\r\nconfidence sacred from Mrs. Fairfield, the Avenels--from all? I myself\r\nam pledged to conceal a secret, which I can only share with you on the\r\nsame condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing,\" announced Leonard indistinctly, and with a bitter\r\nsmile on his lip,--\"nothing, it seems, that I should be proud to boast\r\nof. Yes, I promise--the letter, the letter!\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor placed it in Leonard's right hand, and quietly slipped to\r\nthe wrist of the left his forefinger and thumb, as physicians are said\r\nto do when a victim is stretched on the rack. \"Pulse decreasing,\" he\r\nmuttered; \"wonderful thing, _Aconite_!\" Meanwhile Leonard read as\r\nfollows, faults in spelling and all:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dr. MORGAN--Sir: I received your favur duly, and am glad to hear that\r\nthe pore boy is safe and Well. But he has been behaving ill, and\r\nungrateful to my good son Richard, who is a credit to the whole\r\nFamily, and has made himself a Gentleman, and Was very kind and good\r\nto the boy, not knowing who and What he is--God forbid! I don't want\r\nnever to see him again--the boy. Pore John was ill and Restless for\r\ndays afterwards.--John is a pore cretur now, and has had paralytiks.\r\nAnd he Talked of nothing but Nora--the boy's eyes were so like his\r\nMother's. I cannot, cannot see the Child of Shame. He can't cum\r\nhere--for our Lord's sake, sir, don't ask it--he can't, so Respectable\r\nas we've always been!--and such disgrace! Base born--base born. Keep\r\nhim where he is, bind him prentis, I'll pay anything for That. You\r\nsays, sir, he's clever, and quick at learning; so did Parson Dale, and\r\nwanted him to go to Collidge, and make a Figur--then all would cum\r\nout. It would be my death, sir; I could not sleep in my grave, sir.\r\nNora that we were all so proud of. Sinful creturs that we are! Nora's\r\ngood name that we've saved now, gone, gone. And Richard, who is so\r\ngrand, and who was so fond of pore, pore Nora! He would not hold up\r\nhis Head again. Don't let him make a Figur in the world--let him be a\r\ntradesman, as we were afore him--any trade he Takes to--and not cross\r\nus no more while he lives. Then I shall pray for him, and wish him\r\nhappy. And have not we had enuff of bringing up children to be above\r\ntheir birth? Nora, that I used to say was like the first lady o' the\r\nland--oh, but we were rightly punished! So now, sir, I leave all to\r\nyou, and will pay all you want for the boy. And be Sure that the\r\nsecret's kep. For we have never heard from the father, and, at least,\r\nno one knows that Nora has a living son but I and my daughter Jane,\r\nand Parson Dale and you--and you Two are good Gentlemen--and Jane will\r\nkeep her word, and I am old, and shall be in my grave Soon, but I hope\r\nit won't be while pore John needs me. What could he do without me? And\r\nif _that_ got wind, it would kill me straght, sir. Pore John is a\r\nhelpless cretur, God bless him. So no more from your servant in all\r\ndooty,\r\n\r\n                        \"M. AVENEL.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard laid down this letter very calmly, and, except by a slight\r\nheaving at his breast, and a death-like whiteness of his lips, the\r\nemotions he felt were undetected. And it is a proof how much exquisite\r\ngoodness there was in his heart that the first words he spoke were,\r\n\"Thank Heaven!\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor did not expect that thanksgiving, and he was so startled\r\nthat he exclaimed, \"For what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to pity or excuse in the woman I knew and honored as a\r\nmother. I am not her son--her--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"No; but don't be hard on your true mother--poor Nora!\"\r\n\r\nLeonard staggered, and then burst into a sudden paroxysm of tears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my own mother!--my dead mother! Thou for whom I felt so\r\nmysterious a love--thou, from whom I took this poet soul--pardon me,\r\npardon me! Hard on thee! Would that thou wert living yet, that I might\r\ncomfort thee! What thou must have suffered!\"\r\n\r\nThese words were sobbed forth in broken gasps from the depth of his\r\nheart. Then he caught up the letter again, and his thoughts were\r\nchanged as his eyes fell upon the writer's shame and fear, as it were,\r\nof his very existence. All his native haughtiness returned to him. His\r\ncrest rose, his tears dried.--\"Tell her,\" he said, with a stern\r\nunfaltering voice--\"tell Mrs. Avenel that she is obeyed--that I will\r\nnever seek her roof, never cross her path, never disgrace her wealthy\r\nson. But tell her, also, that I will choose my own way in life--that I\r\nwill not take from her a bribe for concealment. Tell her that I am\r\nnameless, and will yet make a name.\"\r\n\r\nA name! Was this but an idle boast, or was it one of those flashes of\r\nconviction which are never belied, lighting up our future for one\r\nlurid instant, and then fading into darkness?\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt it, my prave poy,\" said Dr. Morgan, growing\r\nexceedingly Welsh in his excitement; \"and perhaps you may find a\r\nfather, who--\"\r\n\r\n\"Father--who is he--what is he? He lives then! But he has deserted\r\nme--he must have betrayed her? I need him not. The law gives me no\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words were said with a return of bitter anguish; then in a\r\ncalmer tone, he resumed, \"But I should know who he is--as another one\r\nwhose path I may not cross.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Morgan looked embarrassed, and paused in deliberation. \"Nay,\" said\r\nhe at length, \"as you know so much, it is surely best that you should\r\nknow all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor then proceeded to detail, with some circumlocution, what we\r\nwill here repeat from his account more succinctly.\r\n\r\nNora Avenel, while yet very young, left her native village, or rather\r\nthe house of Lady Lansmere, by whom she had been educated and brought\r\nup, in order to accept the place of governess or companion in London.\r\nOne evening she suddenly presented herself at her father's house, and\r\nat the first sight of her mother's face she fell down insensible. She\r\nwas carried to bed. Dr. Morgan (then the chief medical practitioner of\r\nthe town) was sent for. That night Leonard came into the world, and\r\nhis mother died. She never recovered her senses, never spoke\r\nintelligibly from the time she entered the house. \"And never therefore\r\nnamed your father,\" said Dr. Morgan. \"We know not who he was.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how,\" cried Leonard, fiercely,--\"how have they dared to slander\r\nthis dead mother? How knew they that I--was--was--was not the child of\r\nwedlock?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no wedding-ring on Nora's finger--never any rumor of her\r\nmarriage--her strange and sudden appearance at her father's house--her\r\nemotions on entrance, so unlike those natural to a wife returning to a\r\nparent's home: these are all the evidence against her. But Mr. Avenel\r\ndeemed them strong, and so did I. You have a right to think we judged\r\ntoo harshly--perhaps we did.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no inquiries were ever made?\" said Leonard mournfully, and after\r\nlong silence--\"no inquiries to learn who was the father of the\r\nmotherless child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Inquiries!--Mrs. Avenel would have died first. Your grandmother's\r\nnature is very rigid. Had she come from princes, from Cadwallader\r\nhimself,\" said the Welshman, \"she could not more have shrunk from the\r\nthought of dishonor. Even over her dead child, the child she had loved\r\nthe best, she thought but how to save that child's name and memory\r\nfrom suspicion. There was luckily no servant in the house, only Mark\r\nFairfield and his wife (Nora's sister): they had arrived the same day\r\non a visit.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Fairfield was nursing her own infant, two or three months old;\r\nshe took charge of you; Nora was buried, and the secret kept. None out\r\nof the family knew of it, but myself and the curate of the town--Mr.\r\nDale. The day after your birth, Mrs. Fairfield, to prevent discovery,\r\nmoved to a village at some distance. There her child died; and when\r\nshe returned to Hazeldean, where her husband was settled, you passed\r\nas the son she had lost. Mark, I know, was a father to you, for he had\r\nloved Nora; they had been children together.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she came to London--London is strong and cruel,\" muttered\r\nLeonard. \"She was friendless and deceived. I see all--I desire to know\r\nno more. This father, he must indeed have been like those whom I have\r\nread of in books. To love, to wrong her--_that_ I can conceive; but\r\nthen to leave, to abandon; no visit to her grave--no remorse--no\r\nsearch for his own child. Well, well; Mrs. Avenel was right. Let us\r\nthink of _him_ no more.\"\r\n\r\nThe man-servant knocked at the door, and then put in his head. \"Sir,\r\nthe ladies are getting very impatient, and say they'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Leonard, with a strange calm return to the things about\r\nhim, \"I ask your pardon for taking up your time so long. I go now. I\r\nwill never mention to my moth--I mean to Mrs. Fairfield--what I have\r\nlearned, nor to any one. I will work my way somehow. If Mr. Prickett\r\nwill keep me, I will stay with him at present; but I repeat, I cannot\r\ntake Mrs. Avenel's money and be bound apprentice. Sir, you have been\r\ngood and patient with me--Heaven reward you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was too moved to answer. He wrung Leonard's hand, and in\r\nanother minute the door closed upon the nameless boy. He stood alone\r\nin the streets of London; and the sun flashed on him, red and\r\nmenacing, like the eye of a foe!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nLeonard did not appear at the shop of Mr. Prickett that day. Needless\r\nit is to say where he wandered--what he suffered--what thought--what\r\nfelt. All within was storm. Late at night he returned to his solitary\r\nlodging. On his table, neglected since the morning, was Helen's\r\nrose-tree. It looked parched and fading. His heart smote him: he\r\nwatered the poor plant--perhaps with his tears.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dr. Morgan, after some debate with himself whether or not to\r\napprise Mrs. Avenel of Leonard's discovery and message, resolved to\r\nspare her an uneasiness and alarm that might be dangerous to her\r\nhealth, and unnecessary in itself. He replied shortly, that she need\r\nnot fear Leonard's coming to her house--that he was disinclined to\r\nbind himself an apprentice, but that he was provided for at present;\r\nand in a few weeks, when Dr. Morgan heard more of him through the\r\ntradesman by whom he was employed, the Doctor would write to her from\r\nGermany. He then went to Mr. Prickett's--told the willing bookseller\r\nto keep the young man for the present--to be kind to him, watch over\r\nhis habits and conduct, and report to the Doctor in his new home, on\r\nthe Rhine, what avocation he thought Leonard would be best suited for,\r\nand most inclined to adopt. The charitable Welshman divided with the\r\nbookseller the salary given to Leonard, and left a quarter of his\r\nmoity in advance. It is true that he knew he should be repaid on\r\napplying to Mrs. Avenel; but, being a man of independent spirit\r\nhimself, he so sympathized with Leonard's present feelings, that he\r\nfelt as if he should degrade the boy did he maintain him, even\r\nsecretly, out of Mrs. Avenel's money--money intended not to raise, but\r\nkeep him down in life. At the worst, it was a sum the doctor could\r\nafford, and he had brought the boy into the world.\r\n\r\nHaving thus, as he thought, safely provided for his two young charges,\r\nHelen and Leonard, the Doctor then gave himself up to his final\r\npreparations for departure. He left a short note for Leonard with Mr.\r\nPrickett, containing some brief advice, some kind cheering; a\r\npostscript to the effect that he had not communicated to Mrs. Avenel\r\nthe information Leonard had acquired, and that it were best to leave\r\nher in that ignorance; and six small powders to be dissolved in water,\r\nand a tea-spoonful every fourth hour--\"Sovereign against rage and\r\nsombre thoughts,\" wrote the Doctor. By the evening of the next day Dr.\r\nMorgan, accompanied by his pet patient with the chronic tic, whom he\r\nhad talked into exile, was on the steamboat on his way to Ostend.\r\n\r\nLeonard resumed his life at Mr. Prickett's; but the change in him did\r\nnot escape the bookseller. All his ingenious simplicity had deserted\r\nhim. He was very distant, and very taciturn; he seemed to have grown\r\nmuch older. I shall not attempt to analyze metaphysically this change.\r\nBy the help of such words as Leonard may himself occasionally let\r\nfall, the reader will dive into the boy's heart, and see how there the\r\nchange had worked, and is working still. The happy dreamy\r\npeasant-genius, gazing on glory with inebriate, undazzled eyes, is no\r\nmore. It is a man, suddenly cut off from the old household holy\r\nties--conscious of great powers, and confronted on all sides by\r\nbarriers of iron--alone with hard reality, and scornful London; and if\r\nhe catches a glimpse of the lost Helicon, he sees, where he saw the\r\nmuse, a pale melancholy spirit veiling its face in shame--the ghost of\r\nthe mournful mother, whose child has no name, not even the humblest,\r\namong the family of men.\r\n\r\nOn the second evening after Dr. Morgan's departure, as Leonard was\r\njust about to leave the shop, a customer stepped in with a book in\r\nhis hand which he had snatched from the shop-boy, who was removing the\r\nvolumes for the night from the booth without.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Prickett, Mr. Prickett!\" said the customer, \"I am ashamed of you.\r\nYou presume to put upon this work, in two volumes, the sum of eight\r\nshillings.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Prickett stepped forth from the Cimmerian gloom of some recess,\r\nand cried, \"What! Mr. Burley, is that you? But for your voice I should\r\nnot have known you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man is like a book, Mr. Prickett; the commonalty only look to his\r\nbinding. I am better bound, it is very true.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard glanced towards the speaker, who now stood under the gas-lamp,\r\nand thought he recognized his face. He looked again; yes, it was the\r\nperch-fisher whom he had met on the banks of the Brent, and who had\r\nwarned him of the lost fish and the broken line.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burley_ (continuing).--\"But 'The Art of Thinking,'--you charge\r\neight shillings for 'The Art of Thinking?'\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Prickett._--\"Cheap enough, Mr. Burley. A very clean copy.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burley._--\"Usurer! I sold it to you for three shillings. It is\r\nmore than 150 per cent. you propose to gain from my 'Art of\r\nThinking.'\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Prickett_, (stuttering and taken aback.)--\"_You_ sold it to me!\r\nAh! now I remember. But it was more than three shillings I gave. You\r\nforget--two glasses of brandy and water.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burley._--\"Hospitality, sir, is not to be priced. If you sell\r\nyour hospitality, you are not worthy to possess my 'Art of Thinking.'\r\nI resume it. There are three shillings, and a shilling more for\r\ninterest. No--on second thoughts, instead of that shilling, I will\r\nreturn your hospitality; and the first time you come my way you shall\r\nhave two glasses of brandy and water.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Prickett did not look pleased, but he made no objection; and Mr.\r\nBurley put the book into his pocket, and turned to examine the\r\nshelves. He bought an old jest-book, a stray volume of the Comedies of\r\nDestouches--paid for them--put them also into his pocket, and was\r\nsauntering out, when he perceived Leonard, who was now standing at the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\"Hem! who is that?\" he asked, whispering to Mr. Prickett.\r\n\r\n\"A young assistant of mine, and very clever.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burley scanned Leonard from top to toe.\r\n\r\n\"We have met before, sir. But you look as if you had returned to the\r\nBrent, and had been fishing for my perch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly, sir,\" answered Leonard. \"But my line is tough, and is not\r\nyet broken, though the fish drags it amongst the weeds, and buries\r\nitself in the mud.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted his hat, bowed slightly, and walked on.\r\n\r\n\"He _is_ clever,\" said Mr. Burley to the bookseller: \"he understands\r\nallegory.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Prickett._--\"Poor youth! He came to town with the idea of turning\r\nauthor: you know what _that_ is, Mr. Burley.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burley_, (with an air of superb dignity.)--\"Bibliopole, yes! An\r\nauthor is a being between gods and men, who ought to be lodged in a\r\npalace, and entertained at the public charge on ortolans and tokay. He\r\nshould be kept lapped in down, and curtained with silken awnings from\r\nthe cares of life--have nothing to do but to write books upon tables\r\nof cedar, and fish for perch from a gilded galley. And that's what\r\nwill come to pass when the ages lose their barbarism, and know their\r\nbenefactors. Meanwhile, sir, I invite you to my rooms, and will regale\r\nyou upon brandy and water as long as I can pay for it; and when I\r\ncannot, you shall regale me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Prickett muttered, \"A very bad bargain, indeed,\" as Mr. Burley,\r\nwith his chin in the air, stepped into the street.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nAt first Leonard had always returned home through the crowded\r\nthoroughfares--the contact of numbers had animated his spirits. But\r\nthe last two days, since the discovery of his birth, he had taken his\r\nway down the comparatively unpeopled path of the New Road. He had just\r\ngained that part of this outskirt in which the statuaries and\r\ntomb-makers exhibit their gloomy wares--furniture alike for gardens\r\nand for graves--and, pausing, contemplated a column, on which was\r\nplaced an urn half covered with a funeral mantle, when his shoulder\r\nwas lightly tapped, and, turning quickly, he saw Mr. Burley standing\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sir, but you understand perch-fishing; and since we find\r\nourselves on the same road, I should like to be better acquainted with\r\nyou. I hear you once wished to be an author. I am one.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard had never before, to his knowledge, seen an author, and a\r\nmournful smile passed his lips as he surveyed the perch-fisher. Mr.\r\nBurley was indeed very differently attired since the first interview\r\nby the brooklet. He looked less like an author, but more perhaps like\r\na perch-fisher. He had a new white hat, stuck on one side of his\r\nhead--a new green overcoat--new gray trousers, and new boots. In his\r\nhand was a whalebone stick, with a silver handle. Nothing could be\r\nmore fragrant, devil-me-carish, and to use a slang word, _tigrish_,\r\nthan his whole air. Yet, vulgar as was his costume, he did not himself\r\nseem vulgar, but rather eccentric, lawless, something out of the pale\r\nof convention. His face looked more pale and more puffed than before,\r\nthe tip of his nose redder; but the spark in his eye was of livelier\r\nlight, and there was self-enjoyment in the corners of his sensual\r\nhumorous lip.\r\n\r\n\"You are an author, sir,\" repeated Leonard. \"Well, and what is the\r\nreport of your calling? Yonder column props an urn. The column is\r\ntall, and the urn is graceful. But it looks out of place by the\r\nroadside: what say you?\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burley._--\"It would look better in the churchyard.\"\r\n\r\n_Leonard._--\"So I was thinking. And you are an author!\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burley._--\"Ah, I said you had a quick sense of allegory. And so\r\nyou think an author looks better in a churchyard, when you see him but\r\nas a muffled urn under the moonshine, than standing beneath the\r\ngas-lamp, in a white hat, and with a red tip to his nose.\r\nAbstractedly, you are right. But, with your leave, the author would\r\nrather be where he is. Let us walk on.\" The two men felt an interest\r\nin each other, and they walked some yards in silence.\r\n\r\n\"To return to the urn,\" said Mr. Burley, \"you think of fame and\r\nchurchyards. Natural enough, before illusion dies; but I think of the\r\nmoment, of existence--and I laugh at fame. Fame, sir--not worth a\r\nglass of cold without! And as for a glass of warm, with sugar--and\r\nfive shillings in one's pocket to spend as one pleases--what is there\r\nin Westminster Abbey to compare with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk on, sir--I should like to hear you talk. Let me listen and hold\r\nmy tongue.\" Leonard pulled his hat over his brows, and gave up his\r\nmoody, questioning, turbulent mind to his new acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAnd John Burley talked on. A dangerous and a fascinating talk it\r\nwas--the talk of a great intellect fallen. A serpent trailing its\r\nlength on the ground, and showing bright, shifting, glorious hues as\r\nit grovelled. A serpent, yet without the serpent's guile. If John\r\nBurley deceived and tempted, he meant it not--he crawled and glittered\r\nalike honestly. No dove could be more simple.\r\n\r\nLaughing at fame, he yet dwelt with an elegant enthusiasm on the joy\r\nof composition. \"What do I care what men without are to say and think\r\nof the words that gush forth on my page?\" cried he. \"If you think of\r\nthe public, of urns, and laurels, while you write, you are no genius;\r\nyou are not fit to be an author. I write because it rejoices me,\r\nbecause it is my nature. Written, I care no more what becomes of it\r\nthan the lark for the effect that the song has on the peasant it wakes\r\nto the plough. The poet, like the lark, sings 'from his watch-tower in\r\nthe skies.' Is this true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very true.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can rob us of this joy! The bookseller will not buy, the public\r\nwill not read. Let them sleep at the foot of the ladder of the\r\nangels--we climb it all the same. And then one settles down into such\r\ngood-tempered Lucianic contempt for men. One wants so little from\r\nthem, when one knows what one's self is worth, and what they are. They\r\nare just worth the coin one can extract from them in order to live.\r\nOur life--_that_ is worth so much to us. And then their joys, so\r\nvulgar to them, we can make them golden and kingly. Do you suppose\r\nBurns drinking at the ale-house, with his boors around him, was\r\ndrinking, like them, only beer and whisky? No, he was drinking\r\nnectar--he was imbibing his own ambrosial thoughts--shaking with the\r\nlaughter of the gods. The coarse human liquid was just needed to\r\nunlock his spirit from the clay--take it from jerkin and corduroys,\r\nand wrap it in the 'singing-robes' that floated wide in the skies: the\r\nbeer or the whisky was needed but for that, and then it changed at\r\nonce into the drink of Hebe. But come, you have not known this\r\nlife--you have not seen it. Come, give me this night. I have moneys\r\nabout me--I will fling them abroad as liberally as Alexander himself,\r\nwhen he left to his share but hope. Come!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither?\"\r\n\r\n\"To my throne. On that throne last sate Edmund Kean--mighty mime. I am\r\nhis successor. We will see whether in truth these wild sons of genius,\r\nwho are cited but 'to point a moral and adorn a tale,' were objects of\r\ncompassion. Sober-suited cits to lament over a Savage and a Morland--a\r\nPorson and a Burns!--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or a Chatterton,\" said Leonard, gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"Chatterton was an impostor in all things; he feigned excesses that he\r\nnever knew. _He_ a bacchanalian--a royster! He!--No. We will talk of\r\nhim. Come!\"\r\n\r\nLeonard went.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nThe Room! And the smoke-reek, and the gas-glare of it. The whitewash\r\nof the walls, and the prints thereon of the actors in their\r\nmime-robes, and stage postures; actors as far back as their own lost\r\nAugustan era, when the stage was a real living influence on the\r\nmanners and the age. There was Betterton in wig and gown--as Cato,\r\nmoralising on the soul's eternity, and halting between Plato and the\r\ndagger. There was Woodward as \"The Fine Gentleman,\" with the\r\ninimitable rakehell air in which the heroes of Wycherly and Congreve\r\nand Farquhar live again. There was jovial Quin as Falstaff, with round\r\nbuckler and \"fair round belly.\" There was Colley Cibber in\r\nbrocade--taking snuff as with \"his Lord,\" the thumb and forefinger\r\nraised in air--and looking at you for applause. There was Macklin as\r\nShylock, with knife in hand; and Kemble, in the solemn weeds of the\r\nDane; and Kean in the place of honor over the chimneypiece.\r\n\r\nWhen we are suddenly taken from practical life, with its real workday\r\nmen, and presented to the portraits of those sole heroes of a\r\nWorld--Phantastic and Phantasmal, in the garments wherein they did\r\n\"strut and fret their hour upon the stage,\" verily there is something\r\nin the sight that moves an inner sense within ourselves--for all of us\r\nhave an inner sense of some existence, apart from the one that wears\r\naway our days: an existence that, afar from St. James's and St.\r\nGiles's, the Law Courts and Exchange, goes its way in terror or mirth,\r\nin smiles or in tears, through a vague magic land of the poets. There,\r\nsee those actors! They are the men who lived it--to whom our world was\r\nthe false one, to whom the Imaginary was the Actual. And did\r\nShakspeare himself, in his life, ever hearken to the applause that\r\nthundered round the Personators of his airy images? Vague children of\r\nthe most transient of the arts, fleet shadows of running waters,\r\nthough thrown down from the steadfast stars, were ye not happier than\r\nwe who live in the Real? How strange you must feel in the great\r\ncircuit that ye now take through eternity! No prompt-books, no lamps,\r\nno acting Congreve and Shakspeare there! For what parts in the skies\r\nhave your studies on the earth fitted you? Your ultimate destinies are\r\nvery puzzling. Hail to your effigies, and pass we on!\r\n\r\nThere, too, on the whitewashed walls, were admitted the portraits of\r\nruder rivals in the arena of fame--yet they, too, had known an\r\napplause warmer than his age gave to Shakespeare; the champions of the\r\nring--Cribb, and Molyneux, and Dutch Sam. Interspersed with these was\r\nan old print of Newmarket in the early part of the last century, and\r\nsundry engravings from Hogarth. But poets, oh! they were there, too:\r\npoets who might be supposed to have been sufficiently good fellows to\r\nbe at home with such companions. Shakspeare, of course, with his\r\nplacid forehead; Ben Jonson, with his heavy scowl; Burns and Byron\r\ncheek by jowl. But the strangest of all these heterogeneous specimens\r\nof graphic art was a full-length print of William Pitt!--William Pitt,\r\nthe austere and imperious. What the deuce did he do there amongst\r\nprize-fighters, and actors, and poets? It seemed an insult to his\r\ngrand memory. Nevertheless there he was, very erect, and with a look\r\nof ineffable disgust in his upturned nostrils. The portraits on the\r\nsordid walls were very like the crambo in the minds of ordinary\r\nmen--very like the motley pictures of the FAMOUS hung up in your\r\nparlour, O my Public! Actors and prize-fighters, poets and statesmen,\r\nall without congruity and fitness, all whom you have been to see or to\r\nhear for a moment, and whose names have stared out in your newspapers,\r\nO my Public!\r\n\r\nAnd the company? Indescribable! Comedians from small theatres, out of\r\nemploy: pale haggard-looking boys, probably the sons of worthy\r\ntraders, trying their best to break their fathers' hearts; here and\r\nthere the marked features of a Jew. Now and then you might see the\r\ncurious puzzled face of some greenhorn about town, or perhaps a\r\nCantab; and men of grave age, and gray-haired, were there, and amongst\r\nthem a wondrous proportion of carbuncled faces and bottle noses. And\r\nwhen John Burley entered there was a shout, that made William Pitt\r\nshake in his frame. Such stamping and hallooing, and such hurrahs for\r\n\"Burly John.\" And the gentleman who had filled the great high leathern\r\nchair in his absence gave it up to John Burley; and Leonard, with his\r\ngrave observant eye, and lip half sad and half scornful, placed\r\nhimself by the side of his introducer. There was a nameless expectant\r\nstir through the assembly, as when some great singer advances to the\r\nlamps, and begins \"_Di tanti palpiti_.\" Time flies. Look at the Dutch\r\nclock over the door. Half-an-hour! John Burley begins to warm. A yet\r\nquicker light begins to break from his eye; his voice has a mellow\r\nluscious roll in it.\r\n\r\n\"He will be grand to-night,\" whispered a thin man who looked like a\r\ntailor, seated on the other side of Leonard.\r\n\r\nTime flies--an hour! Look again at the Dutch clock, John Burley _is_\r\ngrand, he is in his zenith, at his culminating point. What magnificent\r\ndrollery!--what luxuriant humor! How the Rabelais shakes in his easy\r\nchair! Under the rush and the roar of this fun, (what word else shall\r\ndescribe it,) the man's intellect is as clear as a gold sand under a\r\nriver. Such wit, and such truth, and, at times, such a flood of quick\r\neloquence. All now are listeners, silent, save in applause. And\r\nLeonard listened too. Not, as he would some nights ago, in innocent\r\nunquestioning delight. No; his mind has passed through great sorrow,\r\ngreat passion, and it comes out unsettled, inquiring, eager, brooding\r\nover joy itself as over a problem. And the drink circulates, and faces\r\nchange; and there are gabbling and babbling; and Burley's head sinks\r\nin his bosom, and he is silent. And up starts a wild, dissolute,\r\nbacchanalian glee for seven voices. And the smoke-reek grows denser\r\nand thicker, and the gas-light looks dizzy through the haze. And John\r\nBurley's eyes reel.\r\n\r\nLook again at the Dutch clock. Two hours have gone. John Burley has\r\nbroken out again from his silence, his voice thick and husky, and his\r\nlaugh cracked; and he talks, O ye gods! such rubbish and ribaldry; and\r\nthe listeners roar aloud, and think it finer than before. And Leonard,\r\nwho had hitherto been measuring himself, in his mind, against the\r\ngiant, and saying inly, \"He soars out of my reach,\" finds the giant\r\nshrink smaller and smaller, and saith to himself, \"He is but of man's\r\ncommon standard after all.\"\r\n\r\nLook again at the Dutch clock. Three hour have passed. Is John Burley\r\nnow of man's common standard? Man himself seems to have vanished from\r\nthe scene; his soul stolen from him, his form gone away with the fumes\r\nof the smoke, and the nauseous steam from that fiery bowl. And\r\nLeonard looked round, and saw but the swine of Circe--some on the\r\nfloor, some staggering against the walls, some hugging each other on\r\nthe tables, some fighting, some bawling, some weeping. The divine\r\nspark had fled from the human face; the beast is everywhere growing\r\nmore and more out of the thing that had been man. And John Burley,\r\nstill unconquered, but clean lost to his senses, fancies himself a\r\npreacher, and drawls forth the most lugubrious sermon upon the brevity\r\nof life that mortal ever heard, accompanied with unctuous sobs; and\r\nnow and then, in the midst of balderdash, gleams out a gorgeous\r\nsentence, that Jeremy Taylor might have envied; drivelling away again\r\ninto a cadence below the rhetoric of a Muggletonian. And the waiters\r\nchoked up the doorway, listening and laughing, and prepared to call\r\ncabs and coaches; and suddenly some one turned off the gas light, and\r\nall was dark as pitch--howls and laughter as of the damned, ringing\r\nthrough the Pandemonium. Out from the black atmosphere stept the\r\nboy-poet; and the still stars rushed on his sight, as they looked over\r\nthe grimy roof-tops.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nWell, Leonard, this is the first time thou hast shown that thou hast\r\nin thee the iron out of which true manhood is forged and shaped. Thou\r\nhast _the power to resist_. Forth, unebriate, unpolluted, he came from\r\nthe orgy, as yon star above him came from the cloud.\r\n\r\nHe had a latch key to his lodging. He let himself in, and walked\r\nnoiselessly up the creaking wooden stair. It was dawn. He passed on to\r\nhis window, and threw it open. The green elm-tree from the carpenter's\r\nyard looked as fresh and fair as if rooted in solitudes, leagues away\r\nfrom the smoke of Babylon.\r\n\r\n--\"Nature, Nature!\" murmured Leonard, \"I hear thy voice now. This\r\nstills--this strengthens. But the struggle is very dread. Here,\r\ndespair of life--there, faith in life. Nature thinks of neither, and\r\nlives serenely on.\"\r\n\r\nBy-and-by a bird slid softly from the heart of the tree, and dropped\r\non the ground below out of sight. But Leonard heard its carol. It\r\nawoke its companions--wings began to glance in the air, and the clouds\r\ngrew red toward the east.\r\n\r\nLeonard sighed and left the window. On the table, near Helen's\r\nrose-tree, which bent over wistfully, lay a letter. He had not\r\nobserved it before. It was in Helen's hand. He took it to the light,\r\nand read it by the pure healthful gleams of morn:--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear brother Leonard, will this find you well, and (more happy\r\nI dare not say, but) less sad than when we parted? I write kneeling,\r\nso that it seems to me as if I wrote and prayed at the same time. You\r\nmay come and see me to-morrow evening, Leonard. Do come, do--we shall\r\nwalk together in this pretty garden; and there is an arbor all covered\r\nwith jessamine and honeysuckle, from which we can look down on London.\r\nI have looked from it so many times--so many--trying if I can guess\r\nthe roofs in our poor little street; and fancying that I do see the\r\ndear elm-tree. Miss Starke is very kind to me; and I think, after I\r\nhave seen you, that I shall be happy here--that is, if you are happy.\r\nYour own grateful sister,\r\n\r\n                        \"HELEN.\r\n\r\n                          \"Ivy Lodge.\r\n\r\n\"P. S.--Any one will direct you to our house; it lies to the left,\r\nnear the top of the hill, a little way down a lane that is overhung on\r\none side with chestnut trees and lilies. I shall be watching for you\r\nat the gate.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard's brow softened, he looked again like his former self. Up from\r\nthe dark sea at his heart smiled the meek face of a child, and the\r\nwaves lay still as at the charm of a spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\"And what is Mr. Burley, and what has he written?\" asked Leonard of\r\nMr. Prickett when he returned to the shop. Let us reply to that\r\nquestion in our own words, for we know more about Mr. Burley than Mr.\r\nPrickett does.\r\n\r\nJohn Burley was the only son of a poor clergyman, in a village near\r\nEaling, who had scraped and saved and pinched, to send his son to an\r\nexcellent provincial school in a northern country, and thence to\r\ncollege. At the latter, during his first year, young Burley was\r\nremarked by the undergraduates for his thick shoes and coarse linen,\r\nand remarkable to the authorities for his assiduity and learning. The\r\nhighest hopes were entertained of him by the tutors and examiners. At\r\nthe beginning of the second year his high animal spirits, before kept\r\ndown by study, broke out. Reading had become easy to him. He knocked\r\noff his tasks with a facile stroke, as it were. He gave up his leisure\r\nhours to symposia by no means Socratical. He fell into an idle\r\nhard-drinking set. He got into all kinds of scrapes. The authorities\r\nwere at first kind and forbearing in their admonitions, for they\r\nrespected his abilities, and still hoped he might become an honor to\r\nthe university. But at last he went drunk into a formal examination,\r\nand sent in papers after the manner of Aristophanes, containing\r\ncapital jokes upon the Dons and Bigwigs themselves. The offence was\r\nthe greater, and seemed the more premeditated, for being clothed in\r\nGreek. John Burley was expelled. He went home to his father's a\r\nmiserable man, for with all his follies he had a good heart. Removed\r\nfrom ill example, his life for a year was blameless. He got admitted\r\nas usher into the school in which he had received instruction as a\r\npupil. This school was in a large town. John Burley became member of\r\na club formed among the tradesmen, and spent three evenings a week\r\nthere. His astonishing convivial and conversational powers began to\r\ndeclare themselves. He grew the oracle of the club; and from being the\r\nmost sober peaceful assembly in which grave fathers of a family ever\r\nsmoked a pipe or sipped a glass, it grew under Mr. Burley's auspices\r\nthe parent of revels as frolicking and frantic as those out of which\r\nthe old Greek Goat Song ever tipsily rose. This would not do. There\r\nwas a great riot in the streets one night, and the next morning the\r\nusher was dismissed. Fortunately for John Burley's conscience, his\r\nfather had died before this happened--died believing in the reform of\r\nhis son. During his ushership Mr. Burley had scraped acquaintance with\r\nthe editor of the county newspaper, and given him some capital\r\npolitical articles; for Burley was like Parr and Porson, a notable\r\npolitician. The editor furnished him with letters to the journalists\r\nin London, and John came to the metropolis and got employed on a very\r\nrespectable newspaper. At college he had known Audley Egerton, though\r\nbut slightly; that gentleman was then just rising into repute in\r\nParliament. Burley sympathized with some questions on which Audley had\r\ndistinguished himself, and wrote a very good article thereon--an\r\narticle so good that Egerton inquired into the authorship, found out\r\nBurley, and resolved in his own mind to provide for him whenever he\r\nhimself came into office. But Burley was a man whom it was impossible\r\nto provide for. He soon lost his connection with the newspaper. First,\r\nhe was so irregular that he could never be depended upon. Secondly, he\r\nhad strange honest eccentric twists of thinking, that could coalesce\r\nwith the thoughts of no party in the long run. An article of his,\r\ninadvertently admitted, had horrified all the proprietors, staff, and\r\nreaders of the paper. It was diametrically opposite to the principles\r\nthe paper advocated, and compared its pet politician to Catiline. Then\r\nJohn Burley shut himself up and wrote books. He wrote two or three\r\nbooks, very clever, but not at all to the popular taste--abstract and\r\nlearned, full of whims that were _caviare_ to the multitude, and\r\nlarded with Greek. Nevertheless, they obtained for him a little money,\r\nand among literary men some reputation.\r\n\r\nNow Audley Egerton came into power, and got him, though with great\r\ndifficulty--for there were many prejudices against this scampish\r\nharum-scarum son of the Muses--a place in a public office. He kept it\r\nabout a month, and then voluntarily resigned it. \"My crust of bread\r\nand liberty!\" quoth John Burley, and he vanished into a garret. From\r\nthat time to the present he lived--Heaven knows how. Literature is a\r\nbusiness, like everything else; John Burley grew more and more\r\nincapable of business. \"He could not do task-work,\" he said; he wrote\r\nwhen the whim seized him, or when the last penny was in his pouch, or\r\nwhen he was actually in the spunging-house or the Fleet--migrations\r\nwhich occurred to him, on an average, twice a year. He could generally\r\nsell what he had positively written, but no one would engage him\r\nbeforehand. Magazines and other periodicals were very glad to have his\r\narticles, on the condition that they were anonymous; and his style was\r\nnot necessarily detected, for he could vary it with the facility of a\r\npractised pen. Audley Egerton continued his best supporter, for there\r\nwere certain questions on which no one wrote with such force as John\r\nBurley--questions connected with the metaphysics of politics, such as\r\nlaw reform and economical science. And Audley Egerton was the only man\r\nJohn Burley put himself out of the way to serve, and for whom he would\r\ngive up a drinking-bout and do _task-work_; for John Burley was\r\ngrateful by nature, and he felt that Egerton had really tried to\r\nbefriend him. Indeed, it was true, as he had stated to Leonard by the\r\nBrent, that, even after he had resigned his desk in the London office,\r\nhe had had the offer of an appointment in Jamaica, and a place in\r\nIndia from the Minister. But probably there were other charms then\r\nthan those exercised by the one-eyed perch, that kept him to the\r\nneighborhood of London. With all his grave faults of character and\r\nconduct, John Burley was not without the fine qualities of a large\r\nnature. He was most resolutely his own enemy, it is true, but he could\r\nhardly be said to be any one else's. Even when he criticised some more\r\nfortunate writer, he was good-humored in his very satire; he had no\r\nbile, no envy. And as for freedom from malignant personalities, he\r\nmight have been a model to all critics. I must except politics,\r\nhowever, for in these he could be rabid and savage. He had a passion\r\nfor independence, which, though pushed to excess, was not without\r\ngrandeur. No lick-platter, no parasite, no toadeater, no literary\r\nbeggar, no hunter after patronage and subscriptions; even in his\r\ndealings with Audley Egerton, he insisted on naming the price for his\r\nlabors. He took a price, because, as the papers required by Audley\r\ndemanded much reading and detail, which was not at all to his taste,\r\nhe considered himself entitled fairly to something more than the\r\neditor of the journal, wherein the papers appeared, was in the habit\r\nof giving. But he assessed this extra price himself, and as he would\r\nhave done to a bookseller. And, when in debt and in prison, though he\r\nknew a line to Egerton would have extricated him, he never wrote that\r\nline. He would depend alone on his pen, dipped it hastily in the ink,\r\nand scrawled himself free. The most debased point about him was\r\ncertainly the incorrigible vice of drinking, and with it the usual\r\nconcomitant of that vice--the love of low company. To be King of the\r\nBohemians--to dazzle by his wild humor, and sometimes to exalt, by his\r\nfanciful eloquence, the rude gross nature that gathered round\r\nhim--this was a royalty that repaid him for all sacrifice of solid\r\ndignity; a foolscap crown that he would not have changed for an\r\nemperor's diadem. Indeed, to appreciate rightly the talents of John\r\nBurley, it was necessary to hear him talk on such occasions. As a\r\nwriter, after all, he was only capable now of unequal desultory\r\nefforts. But as a talker, in his own wild way, he was original and\r\nmatchless. And the gift of talk is one of the most dangerous gifts a\r\nman can possess for his own sake--the applause is so immediate, and\r\ngained with so little labor. Lower, and lower, and lower, had sunk\r\nJohn Burley, not only in the opinion of all who knew his name, but in\r\nthe habitual exercise of his talents. And this seemed wilfully--from\r\nchoice. He would write for some unstamped journal of the populace, out\r\nof the pale of the law, for pence, when he could have got pounds from\r\njournals of high repute. He was very fond of scribbling off penny\r\nballads, and then standing in the street to hear them sung. He\r\nactually once made himself the poet of an advertising tailor, and\r\nenjoyed it excessively. But that did not last long, for John Burley\r\nwas a Pittite--not a Tory, he used to say, but a Pittite. And if you\r\nhad heard him talk of Pitt, you would never have known what to make of\r\nthat great statesman. He treated him as the German commentators do\r\nShakspeare, and invested him with all imaginary meanings and objects,\r\nthat would have turned the grand practical man into a sybil. Well, he\r\nwas a Pittite; the tailor a fanatic for Thelwall and Cobbett. Mr.\r\nBurley wrote a poem, wherein Britannia appeared to the tailor,\r\ncomplimented him highly on the art he exhibited in adorning the\r\npersons of her sons; and, bestowing upon him a gigantic mantle, said\r\nthat he, and he alone, might be enabled to fit it to the shoulders of\r\nliving men. The rest of the poem was occupied in Mr. Snip's unavailing\r\nattempts to adjust this mantle to the eminent politicians of the day,\r\nwhen, just as he had sunk down in despair, Britannia reappeared to\r\nhim, and consoled him with the information that he had done all mortal\r\nman could do, and that she had only desired to convince pigmies that\r\nno human art could adjust to _their_ proportions the mantle of William\r\nPitt. _Sic itur ad astra_. She went back to the stars, mantle and all.\r\nMr. Snip was exceedingly indignant at this allegorical effusion, and\r\nwith wrathful shears cut the tie between himself and his poet.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the reader has, we trust, a pretty good idea of John\r\nBurley--a specimen of his genus, not very common in any age, and now\r\nhappily almost extinct, since authors of all degrees share in the\r\ngeneral improvement in order, economy, and sober decorum, which has\r\nobtained in the national manners. Mr. Prickett, though entering into\r\nless historical detail than we have done, conveyed to Leonard a\r\ntolerably accurate notion of the man, representing him as a person of\r\ngreat powers and learning, who had thoroughly thrown himself away.\r\n\r\nLeonard did not, however, see how much Mr. Burley himself was to be\r\nblamed for his waste of life; he could not conceive a man of genius\r\nvoluntarily seating himself at the lowest step in the social ladder.\r\nHe rather supposed he had been thrust down there by Necessity.\r\n\r\nAnd when Mr. Prickett, concluding, said, \"Well, I should think Burley\r\nwould cure you of the desire to be an author even more than\r\nChatterton,\" the young man answered gloomily, \"Perhaps,\" and turned to\r\nthe book-shelves.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Prickett's consent, Leonard was released earlier than usual\r\nfrom his task, and a little before sunset he took his way to Highgate.\r\nHe was fortunately directed to take the new road by the Regent's Park,\r\nand so on through a very green and smiling country. The walk, the\r\nfreshness of the air, the songs of the birds, and, above all, when he\r\nhad got half-way, the solitude of the road, served to rouse him from\r\nhis stern and sombre meditations. And when he came into the lane\r\noverhung with chestnut trees, and suddenly caught sight of Helen's\r\nwatchful and then brightening face, as she stood by the wicket, and\r\nunder the shadow of cool murmurous boughs, the blood rushed gayly\r\nthrough his veins, and his heart beat loud and gratefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nShe drew him into the garden with such true childlike joy!\r\n\r\nNow behold them seated in the arbor--a perfect bower of sweets and\r\nblossoms; the wilderness of roof-tops and spires stretching below,\r\nbroad and far; London seen dim and silent, as in a dream.\r\n\r\nShe took his hat from his brows gently, and looked him in the face\r\nwith tearful penetrating eyes.\r\n\r\nShe did not say, \"You have changed.\"--She said, \"Why, why did I leave\r\nyou?\" and then turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind me, Helen. I am man, and rudely born--speak of yourself.\r\nThis lady is kind to you, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she not let me see you? Oh! very kind--and look here.\"\r\n\r\nHelen pointed to fruits and cakes set out on the table. \"A feast,\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she began to press her hospitality with pretty winning ways, more\r\nplayful than was usual for her, and talking very fast, and with forced\r\nbut silvery laughter.\r\n\r\nBy degrees she stole him from his gloom and reserve; and, though he\r\ncould not reveal to her the cause of his bitterest sorrow, he owned\r\nthat he had suffered much. He would not have owned _that_ to another\r\nliving being. And then, quickly turning from this brief confession,\r\nwith assurances that the worst was over, he sought to amuse her by\r\nspeaking of his new acquaintance with the perch-fisher. But when he\r\nspoke of this man with a kind of reluctant admiration, mixed with\r\ncompassionate yet gloomy interest, and drew a grotesque though subdued\r\nsketch of the wild scene in which he had been spectator, Helen grew\r\nalarmed and grave.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, brother, do not go there again--do not see more of this bad man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad!--no! Hopeless and unhappy, he has stooped to stimulants and\r\noblivion;--but you cannot understand these things, my pretty\r\npreacher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes I do, Leonard. What is the difference between being good and bad?\r\nThe good do not yield to temptations, and the bad do.\"\r\n\r\nThe definition was so simple and so wise that Leonard was more struck\r\nwith it than he might have been by the most elaborate sermon by Parson\r\nDale.\r\n\r\n\"I have often murmured to myself since I lost you, 'Helen was my good\r\nangel;'--say on. For my heart is dark to myself, and while you speak\r\nlight seems to dawn on it.\"\r\n\r\nThis praise so confused Helen that she was long before she could obey\r\nthe command annexed to it. But, by little and little, words came to\r\nboth more frankly. And then he told her the sad tale of Chatterton,\r\nand waited, anxious to hear her comments.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, seeing that she remained silent, \"how can _I_ hope,\r\nwhen this mighty genius labored and despaired? What did he want, save\r\nbirth and fortune, and friends, and human justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he pray to God?\" said Helen, drying her tears.\r\n\r\nAgain Leonard was startled. In reading the life of Chatterton, he had\r\nnot much noted the scepticism, assumed or real, of the ill-fated\r\naspirer to earthly immortality. At Helen's question, that scepticism\r\nstruck him forcibly.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you ask that, Helen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, when we pray often, we grow so very, very patient,\" answered\r\nthe child. \"Perhaps, had he been patient a few months more all would\r\nhave been won by him, as it will be by you, brother; for you pray, and\r\nyou will be patient.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard bowed his head in deep thought, and this time the thought was\r\nnot gloomy. Then out from that awful life there glowed another\r\npassage, which before he had not heeded duly, but regarded rather as\r\none of the darkest mysteries in the fate of Chatterton.\r\n\r\nAt the very time the despairing poet had locked himself up in his\r\ngarret, to dismiss his soul from its earthly ordeal, his genius had\r\njust found its way into the light of renown. Good and learned and\r\npowerful men were preparing to serve and save him. Another year,--nay,\r\nperchance, another month--and he might have stood acknowledged and\r\nsublime in the foremost front of his age.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Helen!\" cried Leonard, raising his brows from which the cloud had\r\npassed,--\"Why, indeed, did you leave me?\"\r\n\r\nHelen started in her turn as he repeated this regret, and in her turn\r\ngrew thoughtful. At length she asked him if he had written for the box\r\nwhich had belonged to her father, and been left at the inn.\r\n\r\nAnd Leonard, though a little chafed at what he thought a childish\r\ninterruption to themes of graver interest, owned with self-reproach\r\nthat he had forgotten to do so. Should he not write now to order the\r\nbox to be sent to her at Miss Starke's.\r\n\r\n\"No; let it be sent to you. Take care of it. I should like to know\r\nthat something of mine is with you; and perhaps I may not stay here\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not stay here? That you must, my dear Helen--at least as long as Miss\r\nStarke will keep you, and is kind. By-and-by, (added Leonard, with\r\nsomething of his former sanguine tone) I may yet make my way, and we\r\nshall have our cottage to ourselves. But--Oh Helen!--I forgot--you\r\nwounded me; you left your money with me. I only found it in my drawers\r\nthe other day. Fie!--I have brought it back.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not mine--it is yours. We were to share together--you paid\r\nall; and how can I want it here, too?\"\r\n\r\nBut Leonard was obstinate; and as Helen mournfully received back all\r\nthat of fortune her father had bequeathed to her, a tall female figure\r\nstood at the entrance of the harbor, and said, that scattered all\r\nsentiment to the winds--\"Young man, it is time to go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\"Already!\" said Helen, with faltering accents, as she crept to Miss\r\nStarke's side, while Leonard rose and bowed. \"I am very grateful to\r\nyou, Madam,\" said he, with the grace that comes from all refinement of\r\nidea, \"for allowing me to see Miss Helen. Do not let me abuse your\r\nkindness.\" Miss Starke seemed struck with his look and manner, and\r\nmade a stiff half curtsey.\r\n\r\nA form more rigid than Miss Starke's it was hard to conceive. She was\r\nlike the grim white woman in the nursery ballads. Yet, apparently,\r\nthere was a good nature in allowing the stranger to enter her trim\r\ngarden, and providing for him and her little charge those fruit and\r\ncakes which belied her aspect. \"May I go with him to the gate?\"\r\nwhispered Helen, as Leonard had already passed up the path.\r\n\r\n\"You may, child; but do not loiter. And then come back, and lock up\r\nthe cakes and cherries, or Patty will get at them.\"\r\n\r\nHelen ran after Leonard.\r\n\r\n\"Write to me, brother--write to me; and do not, do not be friends with\r\nthis man who took you to that wicked, wicked place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Helen, I go from you strong enough to brave worse dangers than\r\nthat,\" said Leonard almost gaily.\r\n\r\nThey kissed each other at the little wicket gate, and parted.\r\n\r\nLeonard walked home under the summer moonlight, and on entering his\r\nchamber, looked first at his rose-tree. The leaves of yesterday's\r\nflowers lay strewn round it; but the tree had put forth new buds.\r\n\r\n\"Nature ever restores,\" said the young man. He paused a moment, and\r\nadded, \"It is that Nature is very patient?\"\r\n\r\nHis sleep that night was not broken by the fearful dreams he had\r\nlately known. He rose refreshed, and went his way to his day's\r\nwork--not stealing along the less crowded paths, but with a firm step,\r\nthrough the throng of men. Be bold, adventurer--thou hast more to\r\nsuffer! Wilt thou sink? I look into thy heart, and I cannot answer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Continued from page 97.\r\n\r\n[12] It may be necessary to observe, that homoeopathy professes to deal\r\nwith our moral affections as well as our physical maladies, and has a\r\nglobule for every sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Sharpe's Magazine.\r\n\r\nEGYPT UNDER ABBAS PASHA.\r\n\r\nBY BAYLE ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the late Mohammed Ali heard at length of the taking of Acre by\r\nhis troops under Ibrahim, he exclaimed, \"That place,\" adding an\r\nenergetic but somewhat unsavory expression, \"that place has cost me,\"\r\nnot the lives of so many thousand men, but, \"so many thousand cantars\r\nof gunpowder.\" These words illustrate pretty forcibly the narrow and\r\nselfish views of that celebrated but overrated man. We do not believe,\r\nindeed, that during the whole period of his sway in Egypt, the thought\r\never crossed his mind that he was bound to govern for any other\r\npurpose than his own personal aggrandisement, or that he was to regard\r\nin the slightest degree the feelings, the comfort, the property or the\r\nlives of his people.\r\n\r\nThe system which arose from this wretchedly egotistical state of mind\r\nwas to a certain extent successful. Although great schemes of\r\nconquest, which even a more magnanimous species of selfishness might\r\nhave carried out, were destined to end in comparative shame and\r\ndisgrace, yet a somewhat brilliant _de facto_ sovereignty was erected\r\nand maintained to the termination of the old man's life; and he died\r\nregretting only that he had not been allowed to march to\r\nConstantinople. To the end of his days he was rolling in wealth, and\r\npossessed of arbitrary power in dominions of great extent, where he\r\nwas not the less arbitrary because he was compelled to acknowledge a\r\nsuperior, and to send a tribute, instead of a fleet and an army, to\r\nthe shores of the Bosphorus. The provinces which he called his own,\r\nlay sleeping in a death-like tranquillity; and because he could ride\r\nthrough the streets without a guard, his flatterers told him that he\r\nhad secured the fear, respect and love of the people. For he had many\r\nflatterers, this ancient of days;--not merely his own minions, whose\r\nbusiness it was, but European gentlemen, who affected to be awe-struck\r\nin his presence, and gathered and treasured up and repeated his wise\r\nsayings, his profound observations, and, save the mark! his wit; but\r\nthey never could impress on any impartial hearer the belief in any of\r\nthese things. His sayings and observations were sometimes very\r\nfoolish, sometimes distinguished by respectable common-sense; and his\r\nwit consisted in prefacing a very silly or impertinent remark with a\r\npeculiar grunt. Whenever, therefore, his courtiers, being in a\r\nnarrative mood, began to tell how on a certain occasion the pasha\r\nsaid, \"Hunk!\" &c., a crowd of admirers were ready to smile, and one or\r\ntwo disinterested lookers-on were compelled to smile likewise, though,\r\nperhaps, for a very different reason.\r\n\r\nNothing is easier than to surround a man who has sufficient talents to\r\nfight or wheedle himself into a position of authority with a halo of\r\nfalse reputation; but it is rather more difficult to impress a\r\ncharacter on the civilization of a country, and, now-a-days, to found\r\nan enduring dynasty. We shall not here recapitulate the enormous\r\nblunders of Mohammed Ali, in political and economical questions, nor\r\nexplain how these blunders arose from a selfish desire to make what is\r\nvulgarly called a \"splash,\" nor waste an anathema on his crafty\r\ncruelty and abominable tyranny. We wish merely to remind the reader\r\nthat his period of power having come to a close, little good had been\r\ndone, except, perhaps, improving the method of transacting public\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nWell, there were plenty of people to succeed him. The pasha had a\r\nlarge family of children and grandchildren, to whom he had behaved\r\nsometimes with indulgence, but generally with unreasoning and perverse\r\nseverity. There was scarcely a member of his family with whom he had\r\nnot had many little quarrels, and who did not avoid his presence as\r\nthey did the plague. Even the favorite Ibrahim could not bear to live\r\nin the same city as his presumed father; and the rest would have been\r\nlittle less startled by the last summons of all, than they were by an\r\noccasional order to appear in the presence of the angry and savage old\r\nman. One feeling, however, was pretty general amongst them,--they\r\nregarded the pasha as a wonderfully important personage, and\r\nthemselves consequently, being his children, as little less wonderful\r\nand important. Their hopes were in the uncertainty of life; and very\r\nmany of them, in their own minds, had arranged what they would do in\r\ncase they came to be viceroy--how they would make the money spin, and\r\nwhat mighty devices they would put in practice, to emulate and surpass\r\nthe splendors of \"Effendina\"--\"Our Lord,\" _par excellence_.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that Abbas Pasha alone had the good sense to take\r\nup a position of his own. Whether he was as crafty and politic as some\r\npretend before his elevation to power, it is difficult to decide; but\r\nthe plan, at that time generally ascribed to him, of forming what was\r\ncalled a Turkish or bigoted party--a party of discontented great\r\nfolks, and fanatical Ulemas--a party which should appeal to the\r\nreligious prejudices of the good Caireens, and oppose itself to the\r\ninroad of European adventurers and improvements,--this plan, if\r\ndistinctly formed, was certainly a very sagacious one. Let us be\r\nfrank: Europeans have done more harm than good in Egypt; that is to\r\nsay, whenever they have appeared, except as mere commercial men,\r\nbringing the goods of their own countries, and anxious to take away\r\nthe surplus of the luxuriant crops of the valley of the Nile. As\r\npolitical advisers, partly, perhaps, because men undertook to advise\r\nwho were fit only for the counting-house, partly because their own\r\ninterests were concerned, their intermeddling has been most\r\npernicious. Even the benefits, for some such there are, which have\r\nbeen conferred by their wisdom, have been mingled with an immense\r\namount of misery. There is one fact which has attained an almost\r\nmythological dignity, from its notoriety, and the admirable manner in\r\nwhich it symbolises European meddling in Egypt. An English merchant,\r\nwho ought to have known the manners of the country, advised the\r\nconstruction of the Mahmoudiyeh Canal. It has been most useful to\r\ncommerce; but twenty thousand people were starved or worked to death\r\nwithin six weeks, in order to complete it. Fifty illustrations of the\r\nsame kind might be given; but we wish merely to have our meaning\r\nunderstood, when we say that, if Abbas Pasha or his party ever\r\ncontemplated, as there is reason to suppose they did, the utter\r\ndestruction of foreign influence, the total change of a system, under\r\nwhich French and English measures alternated like whig and tory\r\nadministrations, we must candidly admit they had some very good\r\ngrounds to go upon.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the party was a long and laborious work; very likely\r\nit was brought and kept together more by mutual discontents, ambitious\r\nhopes, and straightforward bigotry, than by any very Machiavellian\r\npolicy. Probably Abbas Pasha really liked ram-fighting, and was a\r\npigeon-fancier, and did not assume these tastes, as the elder Brutus\r\nplayed the fool, in order to accomplish his ends. But, however this\r\nmay be, he certainly occupied a more respectable position than his\r\nuncle Ibrahim, whose whole ideas of the duties of government were\r\ngetting money and playing at soldiers; and than any of the other\r\nmembers of this most obese and heavy-headed family. Even if it be true\r\nthat he meditated a revolt against the broken-down conqueror of Syria,\r\nand was only withheld by fear of the European powers, this fact gives\r\nan impression of his energy, and by no means derogates from his\r\ncharacter in this country. The Saids and the Ahmeds, the Ismains and\r\nthe Mustaphas, would, each and all of them, strike a blow and rid the\r\ncountry of their beloved relations, if the little word _impossible_\r\ndid not stare them in the face. As it is, they are in perpetual feud\r\nwith the head of the family, and there is no end to their bickerings,\r\nheart-burnings, jealousies, and hatreds. Abbas is haughty and\r\noverbearing to them; they as insolent as they may be to him. Be sure\r\nthat, on all sides, direful causes of affront have been given; but\r\nprobably Abbas has been provoked by unbecoming pretensions. What else\r\ncould be expected from a set of ignorant, debauched adventurers, who\r\nhave got a temporary footing in the country, and actually talk with\r\nthe pride of an ancient respectable line of hereditary princes of\r\ntheir rights, and their expectations, and their rank, and so forth!\r\nAbbas, of course, has not the same natural influence over this unruly\r\nbrotherhood as had the ruthless old man, and his more savage immediate\r\nsuccessor; and probably, in attempting to exert his rightful\r\nauthority, has been betrayed into undignified squabbles. It is certain\r\nthat many members of his family have fled or retired to\r\nConstantinople; among others, Mohammed Ali Bey, and the notorious\r\nHazlet Hanem. Some remarks have been made on this subject, to the\r\neffect that Abbas is frightening away his dutiful relations by his\r\nviolent and unreasonable conduct; but if Egypt never loses two of its\r\nnatives whom it can worse spare than these, it will be fortunate.\r\nWithout further inquiry than into their character, one would be\r\ninclined to admire and respect the man who had quarrelled with them.\r\nMohammed Ali is a debauched worthless lad; and Madame Nazlet cannot\r\nhave justice done to her without details into which our pen is not at\r\nliberty to enter.\r\n\r\nIt is a sad thing, certainly, to view the breaking up of a large\r\nfamily; but it would be a sadder thing to witness vice unpunished, and\r\nharmony arising out of the reckless indulgence of unbridled passions.\r\nAbbas Pasha himself, if report speaks true, has little in his private\r\nlife to plead for lenity in judging of his public character. His taste\r\nleads him to the most trifling amusements. Just as of old, when he was\r\nthe supposed head of a kind of Conservative Turkish party, when he was\r\nGovernor of Cairo, and silently nourishing his ambitious schemes, he\r\nspends time and money in the undignified, though not inelegant, and\r\ncertainly innocent, occupation of a pigeon-fancier. Near the new\r\npalace which he is building (none of these Turkish princes seem to\r\ncare about living where their fathers lived before them) rises a\r\nmagnificent square tower, entirely devoted to the loyal winged\r\nfavorites of his Highness the Viceroy, who is reported to be quite\r\nlearned in this department of natural history. Another of his tastes,\r\nfor which Englishmen will have more sympathy, is for horses; and the\r\npublic will remember his bold challenge to the Jockey Club. In what\r\nway he passes the remainder of his leisure hours we do not inquire;\r\nbut we give him, in common with his relatives, the advantage of an\r\nexcuse that has before been urged in their favor--namely, that of an\r\ninfamous education.\r\n\r\nAbbas Pasha has not exactly carried out the views which were\r\nattributed to him before he reached his present elevation. He has not,\r\nfor example, done all that his fanatical anti-Frank friends could\r\nexpect in shaking off foreign influence. He began, it is true, by\r\ngetting rid, in rather a hasty and shabby manner, of many Europeans,\r\nchiefly English, in his employ; and showed a disposition entirely to\r\nput a stop to that enormous blunder of the Barrage. His first, and\r\nvery wise impulse, was either to destroy the works altogether, or,\r\nabandoning them, simply allow the river to work its own majestic will.\r\nBut a clamor was raised on all sides! After throwing so many millions\r\nof dollars into the river, why should not a few millions more be\r\nthrown? I believe the French, who have a fondness for this undertaking\r\nbecause it was suggested by or through Napoleon--(the Osiris of his\r\nday is parent of all wonderful inventions)--I believe, I say, that\r\nFrance made it almost a national question; and so this work, which\r\nalready impedes the navigation of one of the finest rivers in the\r\nworld, and which, if successful, would only achieve an object that one\r\nquarter of the expense in the establishment of steam-engines at\r\nvarious points for raising water would effectually accomplish, is\r\nallowed to drag on slowly towards its conclusion. We must give Abbas\r\ncredit for the courageous good sense which suggested to him that the\r\nfirst loss was the best; and yet we must not withhold from him some\r\npraise for yielding to the influence of friendly persuasion, and\r\nrefraining from carrying out his own opinion, however well founded,\r\nwhen he was told that, by doing so, he would incur the risk of being\r\naccused of treason to his grandfather's fame. The old man had fondly\r\nbelieved that his Barrage would join the Pyramids that look down upon\r\nit in that restricted category of the \"Wonders of the World,\" and\r\nmight well be supposed to lie uneasily in his grave if all the piles\r\nwhich he had caused to be driven, all the mighty walls, and piers, and\r\narches, which he had caused to be raised with a disregard of expense\r\nand human labor worthy of Cheops, were allowed to sink and lie\r\nforgotten in the slimy bed of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThis was the first point on which it appeared that Abbas Pasha was not\r\ndisposed to act up fully to his presumed plan of destroying European\r\ninfluence altogether; but, on many occasions, he early showed a\r\ndisposition to temporize between his prejudices and his interest. We\r\ncannot here enter into details of minor importance, but, coming down\r\nto a recent period, we may mention another instance of a similar\r\nnature. For many years before his death, Mohammed Ali had held out\r\nhopes that he would construct, or allow to be constructed, a railway\r\nfrom Cairo to Suez. This was preeminently an English project--not\r\nlikely to be unuseful to the country at large, it is true, but\r\ncalculated chiefly to promote the more expeditious and comfortable\r\ntransit of passengers to and from India. The Pasha, however, deceived\r\nby an excess of cunning, really entertained no intention of performing\r\nhis promise. With great want of sagacity, he confounded the proposed\r\nstations on the line of railway, which he might have held in his own\r\nhands if he chose, with the counters which he was told had formed the\r\nnuclei of the British power in India. He believed the English had some\r\nsinister designs upon his country, and were engaged in all sorts of\r\nschemes for introducing themselves into it. The same policy which made\r\nhim refuse to deepen the entrance of the port of Alexandria, lest a\r\nBritish fleet might come in, made him unwilling to throw a railway\r\nacross the Desert of Suez, even if he kept the whole management in his\r\nown hands. The recommendations, he saw, came all from one country: the\r\nobjections, nearly all, from another. France was opposed to the\r\nrailway because it had another darling Neapolitan project in\r\nhand--namely, the cutting of the Isthmus of Suez, which was much\r\ntalked of once, but which now nobody mentions but to laugh at. The\r\ndifficulties of execution, immense as they were found to be by the\r\nAustrian commission, were not the most decisive objections. The real\r\nones were contained in an answer to the very appropriate\r\nquestion--_Cui bono?_ However, the railway was shelved for a time. It\r\nhas lately come again upon the tapis; and although it is now proposed\r\nto lay down a line in the first instance between Alexandria and Cairo,\r\nto compensate for the water communication which M. Moujel is spoiling\r\nby his Barrage, yet there is every probability of proper extensions\r\nand branches being made in due time.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, the project be really a serious one. Many say, in spite of\r\nthe official manner in which the announcement has been made, that it\r\nis only a _ruse_, a piece of policy in order to propitiate English\r\ninfluence, and that as soon as certain manoeuvres shall have been\r\nsuccessful or otherwise, nothing more will be said about the railway.\r\nThere is no answering for the diplomacy of Eastern courts; but this\r\nexplanation seems a little too Machiavellian. I have no doubt the\r\npromise has been made, in part, because it is thought to be agreeable\r\nto the English; but I can hardly imagine Abbas Pasha is so foolish as\r\nnot to know that if he coaxes Lord Palmerston with a sugar-plum, and\r\nwhen his lordship opens his mouth, puts a finger in instead, Lord\r\nPalmerston will bite pretty sharply.\r\n\r\nBe these things as they may, it seems admitted on all hands that Abbas\r\nPasha has now completely thrown overboard the party which he courted\r\nso assiduously as heir-apparent, and is seeking foreign, especially\r\nEnglish, support. All this is fair enough provided he does not fall\r\ninto the old error of sacrificing the natives entirely to strangers,\r\nas did his great predecessor, and provided he do not allow himself to\r\nbe persuaded by flatterers--and he has flatterers; what man in power\r\nhas not?--to engage in grand undertakings for the purpose of emulating\r\nthe renown of the old Pharaohs. Egypt wants neither a resuscitation of\r\nold times, nor a hasty imitation of the new. She has to find out the\r\nform of its own civilization: and modern improvements, as they have\r\nbeen hitherto introduced, will only weigh her down into despair.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that Abbas Pasha has no views at all about the progress\r\nof the arts, and manufactures, and commerce; no thought of the\r\namelioration of the country; but that in endeavoring to gain the\r\ngood-will of Europe, he wants to serve some ambitious projects of his\r\nown. There may be something in this. Not that it is probable he\r\nintends to play the old game over again and throw off the yoke of\r\nStamboul; but there is certainly a very arduous struggle now carrying\r\non, both by open and underhand means, between Egypt and the Porte.\r\nThere is an infinity of points of difference between the vassal and\r\nhis lord; but the gist of the matter is, that the former wishes to\r\npreserve all the privileges, to be treated with the same indulgence,\r\nto be left with the same freedom of action, as his grandfather; he\r\nwishes to remain, in fact, a vassal little more than in name, free to\r\nindulge any arbitrary whims; whilst the latter is attempting, with\r\nsome reason,--with great reason indeed, but perhaps in too precipitate\r\na manner, and actuated by feelings that resemble private grudge,--to\r\nreduce Egypt to the same subjection as the rest of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe discussion is a serious one, and much may be said on both sides;\r\nbut it must be accorded at once in favor of the Porte, that the\r\nViceroy of Egypt is not to be considered as an independent sovereign\r\nmerely paying tribute to a superior power, but as an officer of the\r\nEmpire. Certainly, he holds a distinguished position; and his case is\r\nan exceptional one; but very imprudent would be any who should advise\r\nhim to take the same ground as Mohammed Ali, even after his defeat and\r\nexpulsion from Syria, was allowed to assume. He has been levying\r\ntroops, and is said even to have victualled his fleet to give more\r\nweight to his negotiations; but it is not probable he will draw the\r\nsword when, by giving way a little, he may establish a character for\r\nmoderation, and be left undisturbed in a position sufficiently\r\nsplendid to satisfy a very respectable ambition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is hoped that no undue heat, no petty jealousy,\r\nno minor considerations of self-love--excited and encouraged by the\r\nnumerous runagates from Egypt, as Artin Bey and his fellows--will\r\nfinally govern the councils of Constantinople. Many missions have\r\npassed from this country to the Porte with the object of warding off\r\nthe blows that are being aimed at the authority of Abbas Pasha.\r\nProbably they ask too much, as is always done in such cases; but, if\r\nreports speak true, they have been answered with an asperity which\r\nseems calculated rather to provoke a quarrel than to lead to a\r\nsatisfactory settlement. The great question now is about the Tanzamat\r\npromulgated by the Porte, which may be briefly described as a\r\nwell-intended attempt to introduce some kind of order into the\r\nadministration of the empire, to substitute certain rules in place of\r\narbitrary will, and generally to control the actions of what are\r\ncalled the great men in their relations with those who, we suppose,\r\nmay be described as the little men. Such a scheme, even if imperfect\r\nin its details and difficult to be applied, must command our\r\nsympathies. The provinces of the Turkish empire--and Egypt is at least\r\nas great in degree as the remainder--have been too long the sport of\r\ncaprice; and if it be the secret object of Abbas Pasha utterly to\r\nprevent the introduction of this new system--to refuse it even a fair\r\ntrial--he will most certainly, whatever may be the effect of obstinate\r\npassive resistance, receive no countenance or support from England.\r\n\r\nIt is said, however, that he merely desires--and such is the purport\r\nof his remonstrances--that certain modifications, adapted to the\r\npeculiar situation of Egypt, shall be made. The Porte is the best\r\njudge as to how far these modifications are compatible with the spirit\r\nof its decree; and as the communications that have taken place have\r\nbeen chiefly verbal, we will not take upon ourselves to say whether\r\nthey are even suggested by any peculiar necessity. The negotiations\r\nare in progress; and all we can say is, that unless Abbas Pasha be\r\nconsidered too dangerous a subject, and his removal be desired, it\r\nwill be better to make up by amenity of procedure for the inexorable\r\nrequirements of principle.\r\n\r\nThere was one great grievance in Mohammed Ali's time, namely, the\r\nexistence of the _ferdeh_, or tax of one-twelfth upon income of all\r\nkinds, down to that of the poorest fellah. This was a great outrage on\r\nlegality. It was opposed to all the constitutions of the Turkish\r\nempire; and it was understood that, after the Syrian affair, it should\r\nbe voluntarily done away with by the Pasha. But an easy source of\r\nrevenue is not easily given up; and, in spite of all remonstrances,\r\nthe tax was maintained. There was no burden to which the people\r\nobjected more than this. They paid,--but they murmured somewhat\r\nloudly; and even in the coffee-houses many were sometimes bold enough\r\nto say the ferdeh was illegal. On one occasion, when Ibrahim Pasha was\r\nin Cairo, not long before his father's death, there was the semblance\r\nof a riot on the subject; but the stick and the halter were brought\r\ninto play, and the conviction produced that, legal or not legal, the\r\ntax must be paid. Abbas Pasha himself for some time allowed this\r\ncopious fountain to gush into his treasury; but it now suited the\r\npolicy of the Porte to return vigorously to the charge in favor of\r\nlegality; and towards the end of last year the ferdeh was finally\r\nabolished to the infinite delight of the whole population. The\r\nlong-wished-for event was celebrated by illuminations in Alexandria\r\nand Cairo; and the general joy might have risen to something like\r\nenthusiasm had not a fresh, though temporary, cause of discontent\r\naccompanied the boon.\r\n\r\nThis was the conscription, which nearly drove Egypt into a revolt last\r\nwinter. In old times, when soldiers were wanted, men were pounced upon\r\nsuddenly wherever they could be found, and marched off, leaving great\r\ngrief behind; but before any dangerous excitement could be got up.\r\nThis was justly considered a barbarous and inartificial method; and\r\nwhen, for what purposes remains a mystery, a certain levy of men was\r\nrequired, it was determined to proceed with regularity, and to make\r\neach district furnish its quota according to the number of\r\ninhabitants. The idea, at first sight, seems both fair and wise; and\r\nif the people could have been got to acquiesce in the necessity of\r\ntheir supplying soldiers in any proportion at all, would have worked\r\nvery well. But as nobody in Egypt wants to shoulder a musket, as\r\neverybody has the utmost hatred and abhorrence of military service,\r\narising partly from constitutional want of energy, but chiefly from\r\nthe knowledge that the soldier is ill-paid[13] and ill-fed, and\r\nrarely, if ever, returns--we never met but one old discharged\r\ncampaigner in the country--it is not surprising if the public\r\nannouncement of the intentions of Government produced the greatest\r\npossible perturbation. The first impulse of the whole adult\r\npopulation, except those who could boast of some very undoubted claim\r\nof exemption, was to fly to the mountains; and every defile, every\r\ncavern, every catacomb, every quarry in the Libyan and Arabian chains,\r\nwere soon tenanted by people running away from enlistment. Wherever we\r\nwent in our excursions, we became accustomed to see lines of human\r\nbeings perched like crows on the summit of seemingly inaccessible\r\ncliffs, on the look-out for the enemy in the shape of the\r\nSheikh-el-Beled; for the task of catching and forwarding the\r\nprescribed number of \"strong active young men\" devolved on the civil\r\nauthority, aided sometimes by that estimable rural police, the Arnaout\r\nirregular cavalry. On many occasions we surprised these poor people in\r\ntheir retreats; and once, when they mistook us for recruiters, were\r\nassailed with slings diverted from their original purpose, namely,\r\nthat of frightening the sparrows away from the crops. Accounts reached\r\nus at several places that blood had been shed; and the affair in\r\nvarious ways rendered our journey somewhat melancholy. Now we came\r\nupon a large town, as Geneh, seemingly deserted by its whole\r\npopulation, with closed shops and silent streets; then we met a party\r\nof recruits, chained neck and neck, going to their destination; and\r\nanon we saw a crowd of women, driven to despair by the loss of son, or\r\nhusband, or brother, tossing up their arms, tearing their garments,\r\nand invoking curses on their oppressors. Public opinion in all\r\ndespotic countries finds utterance through the weaker sex; they dare\r\nto say what would perhaps bring condign punishment on the men; they\r\nnearly made a revolt once in Cairo under Mohammed Ali, and on the\r\npresent occasion they expressed their mind pretty freely. Some of the\r\nmore noisy brought a good beating on themselves from some irascible\r\nSheikh; but in general their anathemas were received with a kind of\r\nsheepish deprecating good-humor. It was difficult to ascertain how\r\nmany recruits were at last got together, but, as near as I could\r\ngather, the number ordered was one in about every 180 souls.\r\n\r\nThe sight of so much unhappiness naturally excited great indignation\r\nand disgust; but not so much perhaps on reflection as the permanent\r\nmisery and ill-treatment of a great proportion of the population.\r\nAbbas Pasha has taken the old system as he found it, and, with the\r\nexception of the abolition of the ferdeh, has done nothing to\r\nalleviate the condition of the fellah. It is especially on the lands\r\nof the great men, the pashas and the beys, that these poor serfs are\r\nworst off. Their profession is that of agricultural laborers, but it\r\nmust not be supposed that they have freedom to carry their services to\r\nwhat master they will. They belong to the land as much as do the\r\npalm-trees; and the nature of their occupation, their hours of labor,\r\nand their pay, are regulated by their lord and master in a perfectly\r\narbitrary way. At Randa, opposite Sheikh Abadeh, we found a sugar\r\nestate occupying 1,300 men, and endeavored to ascertain in as exact a\r\nmanner as possible how they were treated. We found that, in the first\r\nplace, they were, of course, forced to work, both on the land and in\r\nthe factory, at a nominal pay of twenty-five paras, or three-halfpence\r\na head, and that some of them were in active employment nearly\r\neighteen hours a day. Now it _is_ possible for a man to exist on such\r\nwages in that part of Egypt, even with a family; and as bare existence\r\nis considered in most countries an adequate reward for unintelligent\r\nlabor, there seemed not so much reason to complain. But then came the\r\nquestion, how was the payment made? The answer in substance was, the\r\nmen are paid twenty-five paras a day, but they never get the money;\r\nthey receive what is called its value in the refuse molasses; but this\r\nonly when it can be of little service to them, when the owner of the\r\nestate has glutted the market, and they can only sell at a loss of\r\nforty or fifty per cent. They would be only too happy to receive\r\nfifteen paras in hard cash; as it is, some of them necessarily eke out\r\ntheir living by stealing, and others by the produce of little plots of\r\nland, which they cultivate at night when they should be reposing after\r\nthe fatigues of the day. The women and children assist them, when the\r\nlatter are not pressed into what is called the service of the state;\r\nthat is, compelled to dig canals, and perform other light work for\r\nwhich they receive neither pay nor food. Their parents bring them\r\nfood, or some charitable person flings them a morsel of coarse bread,\r\notherwise they would perish.\r\n\r\nSuch is pretty nearly the state of things in the private possessions\r\nof all the descendants of Mohammed Ali. In fairness, however, we must\r\nremind the reader that Abbas Pasha is only answerable for acquiescing\r\nin customs handed down. He has not established any new pernicious\r\nregulation that we have heard of; and even if he remain perfectly\r\nquiescent and leave things to go their own gait, King Log is better\r\nthan King Stork. The mischievous activity of Mohammed Ali is not to be\r\nregretted; and if, by the influence of Constantinople prudently\r\nexercised, some little check is gradually put upon the caprices and\r\nviolence of the proprietors who call themselves princes--and it is for\r\nthe interest of Abbas Pasha that this should be the case--Egypt,\r\nthough not possessed of all the happiness she wants, might not be very\r\ndiscontented, and would have no reason to look back with regret on the\r\ntime of the old pasha. According to all accounts, some classes of the\r\nagricultural laborers are gradually enriching themselves in spite of\r\nthe burdens which they bear; and, although wealth is timid to show\r\nitself, a great amelioration in the state of the country may soon be\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Soldiers will often stop a European in a by-place and beg. They get\r\nabout twenty paras (a penny farthing) a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS IN CHINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a quaintness in the notion of a Jewish colony surrounded by\r\nChinese; the fixed among the fixed. The fact that such a colony\r\nexists, or has existed when found, ought to be especially remarked,\r\nfor to ethnologists and others it may prove a valuable opportunity for\r\nspeculation. Jews in China, what will they be like? Will the Jew stand\r\nout from the surrounding uniformity of Chinese life, like the one tree\r\nof the desert (for which, see Panorama of Overland Mail, and hear\r\nlecture upon same); or will he become non-entity, like among like,\r\nadding nothing to the first idea--silence in a calm? In the Jewish\r\nsynagogue in Kai-foung-fou, concerning which we have presently to\r\nspeak, there are Chinese inscriptions. The first placed there in 1444,\r\nby a literary Jew, is intended to prove the close analogy between\r\nJewish and Chinese points of doctrine. \"The author,\" it says, \"of the\r\nlaw of Yse-lo-ye (Israel) is Ha-vou-lo-han (Abraham). His law was\r\ntranslated by tradition to Niche (Moses). He received his book on Mt.\r\nSinai. His book has fifty-four sections. The doctrine which is therein\r\ncontained is much like that of the Kings,\" (which are sacred volumes\r\nof the Chinese). The author of the inscription repeats many passages\r\nto prove that in their worship to heaven, their ceremonies, their\r\nbehavior to the old and young, their patriarchal character, their\r\nprayers, and their mode of honoring dead ancestors, the Jews resemble\r\nthe Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe author of a second inscription, a grand mandarin in his own time,\r\nspeaks to the same purpose. \"From the time of Han,\" says this\r\ngentleman, whose name is Too-tang, \"from the time of Han, the Jews\r\nfixed themselves in China; and in the twentieth year of the cycle 65,\r\n(which is, by interpretation, 1163,) they offered to the Emperor\r\nHiao-tsong a tribute of cloth from India. He received them well, and\r\npermitted them to live in Kai-foung-fou. They formed then sixty-six\r\nfamilies. They built a synagogue where they placed their Kings, or\r\nDivine Scriptures.\" This mandarin concludes with an eulogium of Jewish\r\nvirtue, after the approved manner of epitaphs.\r\n\r\nThe Jews emphatically cultivated agriculture, commerce, were faithful\r\nin the armies, upright as magistrates, and rigid in observance of\r\ntheir ceremonies. One only wants to wind up with the scrap,\r\n\"Affliction sore, long time they bore;\" but affliction on the part of\r\nthe Chinese, at any rate, they certainly did not bear; they were more\r\nthan tolerated, they were understood; ceremony-men to ceremony-men\r\nwere ceremoniously polite to one another. The Jews and Chinese even\r\nintermarried; on their first introduction by way of Persia to the\r\nChinese Empire, they had settled here and there in sundry Chinese\r\ncities; but by the marriage with Chinese disciples of Confucius or\r\nMahomet, the Jewish colonies were melted down into the pure Chinese\r\nmetal; and when this history begins, nothing is known of any synagogue\r\nin China, save the synagogue at Kai-foung-fou, which is a city in the\r\nheart of the Flowery Land, the capital of the central province of\r\nHonan; and for an account of which we are indebted to Father Ricci,\r\none of the Jesuit Missionaries.\r\n\r\nFather Ricci died in the year 1610, at Pekin, which was his station.\r\nFather Ricci, at Pekin, first heard of the Jewish synagogue at\r\nKai-foung-fou, and the information startled him exceedingly. The young\r\nJew who enlightened Father Ricci on the subject told him that there\r\nwere then at Kai-foung-fou barely a dozen Jewish families, and that\r\nfor five or six hundred years they had preserved in their synagogue a\r\nvery ancient copy of the Pentateuch. The father produced a Hebrew\r\nBible, and the young man recognized the characters, although he could\r\nnot read them, for he knew no language but Chinese. Four years after\r\nthis, Father Ricci (whose business at Pekin would not permit him to go\r\ngadding) had an opportunity of sending off to Kai-foung-fou a Chinese\r\nJesuit, with a letter written in Chinese, to the chief of the\r\nsynagogue. He explained to the rabbi his own reverence for the books\r\nof the Old Testament, and informed him of its fulfilled predictions,\r\nand the advent of a Messiah. The rabbi shook his head at that, saying,\r\n\"that so it could not be, because they had yet to expect the Messiah\r\nfor ten thousand years.\" The good natured rabbi nevertheless did\r\nhomage to Father Ricci's great abilities. He was an old man, and saw\r\nnone about him fit to guide his people; he therefore besought the\r\nlearned Jesuit to come to Kai-foung-fou, and undertake the guidance of\r\nthe synagogue, under one only condition, a true Chinese-Jewish one,\r\nthat he would pledge himself to abstinence from all forbidden meats.\r\nHowever, that was very much as if Dr. Jones of Bettws-y-Coed should\r\noffer his practice to Sir B. Brodie of London. Father Ricci had a\r\nlarger work in hand, and so he stopped at Pekin.\r\n\r\nIn 1613, Father Aleni (such an uncommonly wise man, that the Chinese\r\ncalled him the Confucius of Europe) was directed to proceed to\r\nKai-foung-fou and make investigation. Father Aleni, being well up in\r\nhis Hebrew, was a promising man to send on such an errand, but he\r\nfound the rabbi dead, and the Jews, though they let him see the\r\nsynagogue, would not produce their books. The particulars of nothing\r\nhaving been done on this occasion are to be found related by Father\r\nTrigaut, in choice Latin, and choicer Italian, (_de Expedit. Sinica,\r\nlib. 1., cap. 2, p. 118_,) and by Father Samedo (_Relatione della\r\nChina, part 1., cap. 30, p. 193_.)\r\n\r\nA residence was established by the Jesuits in Kai-foung-fou. _Now_,\r\nthought those who thought at all upon such matters, we shall have\r\nsomething done. If we can only compare our Old Testament texts with an\r\nancient exemplar, that will be no small gain. A certain father Gozani\r\nwent zealously into the whole subject, entered the synagogue, copied\r\nthe inscriptions, and transmitted them to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Jews told Father Gozani that in a temple at Pekin was a large\r\nvolume, wherein were inscribed the sacred books of foreigners resident\r\nin China. That volume was sought afterwards by Europeans at Pekin, but\r\nnot found. Certainly such a volume does exist among the Chinese\r\nrecords. The Jews, however, told Father Gozani not only about what\r\nexisted in Pekin, but all about themselves at Kai-foung-fou. The\r\nFather wrote a letter, dated 1704, containing what he learned in this\r\nmanner. It appears that by that application of \"soft sawder\" which is\r\nor ought to be well understood by men of the world and Jesuits, the\r\nFather gratified the Jews, so that they paid him voluntary visits. He\r\nreturned their visits by a call upon them at their synagogue, where,\r\nhe says--\"I had a long conversation with them; and they showed me\r\ntheir inscriptions; some of which are in Chinese, and others in their\r\nown tongue. I saw also their _Kims_, or religious books, and they\r\nsuffered me to enter even the most secret place of their synagogue, to\r\nwhich they can have no access themselves. That place is reserved for\r\ntheir _Chian-Kiao_; that is to say, chief of the synagogue, who never\r\napproaches it but with the most profound respect.\r\n\r\n\"There were thirteen tabernacles placed upon tables, each of which was\r\nsurrounded by small curtains. The sacred _Kim_ of Moses (the\r\nPentateuch) was shut up in each of these tabernacles, twelve of which\r\nrepresented the Twelve Tribes of Israel; and the thirteenth, Moses.\r\nThe books were written on long pieces of parchment, and folded up on\r\nrollers. I obtained leave from the chief of the synagogue to draw the\r\ncurtains of one of these tabernacles, and to unroll one of the books,\r\nwhich appeared to me to be written in a hand exceedingly neat and\r\ndistinct. One of these books had been luckily saved from the great\r\ninundation of the river _Hoang-ho_, which overflowed the city of\r\nKai-foung-fou, the capital of the province. As the letters of the book\r\nhave been wetted, and on that account are almost effaced, the Jews\r\nhave been at great pains to get a dozen copies made, which they\r\ncarefully preserve in the twelve tabernacles above mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"There are to be seen also in two other places of the synagogue,\r\ncoffers, in which are shut up with great care several other little\r\nbooks, containing different divisions of the Pentateuch of Moses,\r\nwhich they call _Ta-Kim_, and other parts of their law. They use these\r\nbooks when they pray; they showed me some of them, which appeared to\r\nbe written in Hebrew. They were partly new and partly old, and half\r\ntorn. They, however, bestow as much attention on guarding them as if\r\nthey were gold or silver.\r\n\r\n\"In the middle of the synagogue stands a magnificent chair, raised\r\nvery high, and ornamented with a beautiful embroidered cushion. This\r\nis the chair of Moses, in which every Saturday, and days of great\r\nsolemnity, they place their Pentateuch, and read some portions of it.\r\nThere also may be seen a _Van-sui-pai_, or painting, on which is\r\ninscribed the Emperor's name; but they have neither statues nor\r\nimages. This synagogue fronts the west, and when they address their\r\nprayers to the Supreme Being, they turn towards that quarter, and\r\nadore him under the name of _Tien_, _Cham-Tien_, _Cham-ti_, and\r\n_Kao-van-voe-tche_; that is to say, _Creator of all things_; and\r\nlastly, of _Van-voe-tchu-tcai, Governor of the Universe_. They told me\r\nthat they had taken these names from the Chinese books, and that they\r\nused them to express the Supreme Being and First Cause.\r\n\r\n\"In going out from the synagogue, I observed a hall, which I had the\r\ncuriosity to enter, but I found nothing remarkable in it, except a\r\ngreat number of censers. They told me that in this hall they honored\r\ntheir _Chim-gins_, or the great men of their law. The largest of these\r\ncensers, which is intended for the Patriarch Abraham, stands in the\r\nmiddle of the hall, after which come those of Isaac, and Jacob, and\r\nhis twelve branches, or the Twelve Tribes of Israel; next are those of\r\nMoses, Aaron, Joshua, Esdras, and several other illustrious persons,\r\nboth male and female.\r\n\r\n\"After quitting this apartment, they conducted us to the Hall of\r\nStrangers, in order to give us an entertainment. As the titles of the\r\nbooks of the Old Testament were printed in Hebrew at the end of my\r\nBible, I showed them to _Cham-Kiao_, or chief of the synagogue; he\r\nimmediately read them, though they were badly printed, and he told me\r\nthat they were the names of their _Chin-Kim_, or Pentateuch. I then\r\ntook my Bible, and the _Cham-Kiao_ took his _Beresith_ (thus they name\r\nthe Book of Genesis); we compared the descendants of Adam, until Noah,\r\nwith the age of each, and we found the most perfect conformity between\r\nboth. We afterwards ran over the names and chronology in Genesis,\r\nExodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, which compose the\r\nPentateuch, or five Books of Moses. The chief of the synagogue told me\r\nthat they named these five books _Beresith_, _Veelesemoth_, _Vaiiora_,\r\n_Vaiedabber_, and _Haddebarim_, and that they divided them into\r\nfifty-three volumes; _viz._, Genesis into twelve, Exodus into eleven,\r\nand the three following books into ten volumes each, which they call\r\n_Kuen_. Some of these they opened, and presented to me to read; but it\r\nwas to no purpose, as I was unacquainted with the Hebrew language.\r\n\r\n\"Having interrogated them respecting the titles of the other books of\r\nthe Bible, the chief of the synagogue replied, that they were in\r\npossession of some of them, but that they wanted a great many, and of\r\nothers they had no knowledge. Some of his assistants added, that they\r\nhad lost several books in the inundation of the Hoang-ho, of which I\r\nhave spoken.\"\r\n\r\nFather Gozani has spoken of the inundation, but we have not, and so we\r\nwill do so now. Previously, however, we may call attention to the\r\ndistinct adoption of the Chinese \"Hall of Ancestors\" among these Jews,\r\nand of a place for showing hospitality to strangers as an appendage to\r\ntheir place of worship. It is in this way that, without violating\r\ntheir own opinions, they became assimilated more completely to their\r\nneighbors. Father Gozani also notes that their accounts of sacred\r\nhistory were grossly disfigured with Talmudical legends, or other\r\nstories of that class--a fact not to be lost sight of by the\r\nspeculator. The Jews, in the time of Father Gozani, composed seven\r\nfamilies--Phao, Kin, Che, Kao, The-Man, Li, Ngai--including in all\r\nabout one thousand souls. They intermarried with each other, and had\r\ntheir own fashion of hair-cutting. These seven families of\r\nKai-foung-fou were the remains of seventy who had of old established\r\nthemselves in that capital. Now for the inundation. That event took\r\nplace in the year 1642, and it occurred as follows:--Li-cong-tse, a\r\nrebel, with a big army, besieged the city. The inhabitants, after\r\ndefending themselves for six months, still refused to succumb, because\r\nthey expected rescue from the Emperor. The Emperor did come, a vastly\r\nclever fellow, who determined to destroy the enemy by a great\r\nmaster-stroke. \"I'll drown every man-jack!\" he said, and broke the\r\ndikes that confined the Hoang-ho, or Yellow River, a league distant\r\nfrom the city. Out poured the stream and drowned the besiegers, and\r\nbesieged the city in its turn, knocked down its walls, and destroyed\r\nthirty thousand of its inmates. The Emperor, a cockney sportsman on\r\nthe largest scale, shot at the pigeon and killed the crow. It was in\r\nthis inundation that the number of the Jews was thinned; diluted by\r\nthe waters of the river, their Pentateuch was damaged and some other\r\nportions of their scripture altogether lost.\r\n\r\nBefore passing down from Father Gozani, we must extract his rough\r\npicture of the Jewish synagogue, as it existed in his day. He says of\r\nthe Jews--\r\n\r\n\"They have no other synagogue but this, in the capital of the province\r\nof Ho-Nan. I perceived in it no altar, nor any other furniture, but\r\nthe chair of Moses, with a censer, a long table, and large\r\nchandeliers, in which were placed candles made of tallow. This\r\nsynagogue has some resemblance to our European churches; it is divided\r\ninto three aisles; that in the middle is occupied by the table of\r\nincense, the chair of Moses, the painting, and the tabernacles already\r\nmentioned, in which are preserved the thirteen copies of the\r\nPentateuch. These tabernacles are constructed in the form of an arch,\r\nand the middle aisle is like the choir of the synagogue; the two\r\nothers are set apart as places of prayer, and for the adoration of the\r\nSupreme Being. Within the building there is a passage which runs quite\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\"As there formerly were, and still are, among them Bachelors and\r\n_Kien-sens_, which is a degree different from that of a Bachelor, I\r\ntook the liberty of asking them if they rendered homage to Confucius;\r\nthey replied that they honored him in the same manner as the rest of\r\nthe literati, and that they assisted them in solemn ceremonies, which\r\nare performed in halls dedicated to their great men. They added, that\r\nin spring and autumn they practised certain rites in honor of their\r\nancestors, according to the manner of Chinese, in the hall next to\r\ntheir synagogue; that they did not present them the flesh of hogs, but\r\nof other animals; that in other ceremonies they were contented with\r\noffering them porcelain dishes filled with dainties and sweetmeats,\r\nwhich they accompanied with perfumes and profound reverences or\r\nprostrations. I asked them, likewise, if in their houses or Hall of\r\nAncestors, they had tablets in honor of their departed relations; they\r\nreplied that they used neither tablets, images, nor any thing else,\r\nbut only a few censers. We must, however, except their mandarins, for\r\nwhom alone they place in the Hall of Ancestors a tablet inscribed with\r\ntheir name and rank.\"\r\n\r\nFather Gozani adds, that \"these Jews, in their inscriptions, call\r\ntheir law the Law of Israel, _Yselals-Kiao_, which they name also\r\n_Kon-Kiao_, Ancient Law; _Tien-Kiao_, Law of God, and _Tien-Kin-Kiao_,\r\nto signify that they abstain from blood, and cut the nerves and veins\r\nof the animals they kill, in order that the blood may flow more easily\r\nfrom them.\"\r\n\r\nThis custom gives to the Jews in China, at the present day, the name\r\nof Cut-Nerves. To the present day our story now descends; for, after\r\nthe time of Father Gozani, blank follows in the way of action. Father\r\nEtienne, who meditated a work upon the Sacred Scriptures in reply to\r\nthe _Critici Sacri_, was eager to push on investigations. From the\r\nletters of Father Gozani, and from those which Father Domingo and\r\nGambil wrote upon it, material was obtained for the memoir published\r\nunder the direction of M. L. Aime Martin, in which he remarks that the\r\ndetail would be regarded with the more curiosity, as it had been often\r\ndemanded, and as Father du Halde had contented himself with merely\r\npromising it in his great work, \"Description de la Chine.\" So we have\r\nfairly got out of the past into the present, where our story thus runs\r\non.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1815, the Chinese Jews endeavored unsuccessfully to\r\ncommunicate with Europe by means of a Hebrew letter addressed to\r\nLondon, which seems not to have been delivered. Last year the Jewish\r\nSociety of London determined, however, to communicate with them. Miss\r\nCooks, an energetic and devoted Jewess, placed her purse in the hands\r\nof the Society; nothing impeded fresh research; the English bishop at\r\nHong Kong co-operated, Dr. Medhurst was consulted, and two Chinese\r\nChristians were at length appointed to proceed to Kai-foung-fou. The\r\nelder of these two was a bachelor; the younger was a student from the\r\nMissionaries' College at Batavia; but the junior was named to head the\r\nenterprise, because he had previously displayed zeal and ability, and\r\nalso because he could write English fluently, and would journalize in\r\nthat language. His journals, therefore, could be laid before Miss\r\nCooks, uninjured by translation.\r\n\r\nOur heroes--for so we will call the two adventurers--set out from\r\nShanghae, on the 15th of last November, by boat to Toing-kiang-tou. In\r\na car, drawn by mules, they were then jolted along, following the\r\ntrack of the Hoang-ho, rising at three o'clock on winter mornings, to\r\nsave time--a proceeding which involves almost supererogatory\r\nself-denial. Population near the Yellow River they found rare and\r\nunhealthy. Localities which figure in the geographical charts of the\r\nempire as principal places, or as towns of the second class, are but\r\nhuge piles of rubbish, surrounded by crumbling walls. Here and there a\r\ngate, with its inscription half-effaced, informs the traveller that he\r\nis entering a mighty town.\r\n\r\nPerseverance, and a mule car, brought the travellers to Kai-foung-fou.\r\nThey found there many Mahometans, openly exercising right of\r\nconscience, and flying their religion on a flag displayed over their\r\ngate. These Mahometans are, for the most part, hotel-keepers, and with\r\none of them our heroes lodged. Of him they began asking about\r\nCut-Nerves. Mine host of the Crescent said there were still some Jews\r\nin Kai-foung-fou, and offered himself as a cicerone to their\r\nsynagogue. Thither they went. They found its outer wall in ruins;\r\nbriers and dirt filled the grand entrance; \"the pillars of the\r\nbuilding, the inscribed marbles, the stone balustrade, before the\r\nperistyle of the temple, the ornamental sculpture--all were cracked,\r\nbroken, and overturned.\" Under the wings of the synagogue, the chapels\r\nbuilt in honor of the patriarchs--nestled together, cold and naked,\r\nsleeping on the bare stones, those objects of our European interest,\r\n\"the Jews in China.\" Poor and miserable as they are, they had begun to\r\nsell the stones of their temple for bread, and a portion of land\r\nwithin their sacred inclosure had been already sold to an adjacent\r\ntemple of the Buddhists.\r\n\r\nStill, there were the cylinders inclosing the sacred rolls of the Old\r\nTestament, which, luckily, had not proved eatable. In number, these\r\nrolls were about a dozen, each thirty feet long by three feet wide.\r\nThey are of white sheep-skin, inscribed with very small Hebrew\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nFor fifty years these poor Jews have been without the guidance of a\r\nrabbi, and there is not one left who can read a word of Hebrew. In a\r\ndozen years, probably, the last trace of the Jews in China will\r\nexpire. The travellers gave money to the mournful congregation in the\r\nsynagogue, and received leave to copy the inscriptions, about which\r\nthe Jesuits had previously informed us. Moreover, they obtained, and\r\nhave brought home, eight Hebrew manuscripts; six contain portions of\r\nthe Old Testament, namely, of Exodus, chapters 1-6, and 38-40; of\r\nLeviticus, chapters 19, 20; of Numbers, chapters 13, 14, 15; of\r\nDeuteronomy, chapters 11-16, and chapter 32; with portions of the\r\nPentateuch, the Psalms, and Prophets. The other two manuscripts are of\r\nthe Jewish Liturgy. The leaves of these manuscripts \"are of a species\r\nof card-board, on which the words, as it were, are engraved with a\r\npoint; the binding is in silk, and bears evident marks of being of\r\nforeign origin. Two Israelitish merchants, to whom these books were\r\nshown at Shanghae, spoke of having seen similar ones at Aken, and the\r\npresence here and there upon the margins of Persian words,\r\ninterspersed with Hebrew annotations, seemed to indicate that the\r\nbooks came originally from some western country of Asia, perhaps\r\nPersia, or some of the high provinces of India, where Persic has from\r\ntime immemorial been the language used among people of education.\r\nAlthough the annotations mentioned are numerous, and apparently\r\nreferring to different epochs, no trace of any Chinese character is to\r\nbe discovered, nor any of those marks or signs which immediately\r\nbetray Chinese origin. No date exists by which the age can be\r\ndetermined.\"\r\n\r\nWe hope the statement is correct which tells us that these manuscripts\r\nare to be deposited in the British Museum. Fac-similes are at the same\r\ntime promised, printed in Hebrew, accompanied with a plan of the\r\nsynagogue, made on the spot by the Chinese travellers, and the journal\r\nof our junior hero, written in English and Chinese. The journal in\r\nEnglish would not be a very ponderous affair, the entire expedition\r\nhaving occupied only two months--the residence at Kai-foung-fou, five\r\ndays. We may usefully remember how the good Chinese, rising so\r\nfearfully betimes, did justice to the generosity and zeal of their\r\npatroness. Are there not men of might at work upon investigations for\r\nthe public, who, at their ordinary rate, might have come to abandon\r\nthis business in forty years, after eliminating fifty pounds of\r\nblue-book?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Authors and Books._\r\n\r\n\r\nLUDWIG FUERBACH, the last great philosopher of Young Germany, whose\r\ndoctrines have been complacently declared as \"more utterly\r\nirreconcilable with pietism or orthodox Christianity than those of any\r\nof his predecessors,\" has at length published his course of lectures\r\n\"On the Existence of Religion,\" delivered at Heidelberg, from the\r\nmonth of December 1848 to March 1849. With regard to the apparent\r\napathy with which he has regarded the great political events of these\r\nlatter days, and the reproach that he has taken no active part\r\ntherein--in which he forms a somewhat unfavorable contrast with Fichte\r\nand other great thinkers of the last generation--he remarks: \"It will\r\nnot appear strange that these lectures have not before been published;\r\nfor what could, at the present day, be more seasonable than a\r\nremembrance of the year 1848? And by this souvenir I would also\r\nremark, that these lectures have been my only public intimations of\r\nactivity during the so-called time of the Revolution. My own share in\r\nall the political and unpolitical deeds and movements of those times,\r\nwas merely that of a critical beholder and listener, for the very\r\nsimple reason that I could take no part in aimless, and consequently\r\nheadless (silly) undertakings, having foreseen, or at least felt, from\r\nthe very beginning of the whole movement, that such would be its\r\nresult. A well-known Frenchman lately put me the question, Why I took\r\nno active part in the revolution of 1848? I replied, Mr.\r\nTaillandier,[14] if another revolution should break forth, and I take\r\nan active part therein, then may you, to the terror of your\r\nGod-believing soul, be certain that this would be an overpowering\r\nrevolution, bringing with it the judgment-day of monarchy and\r\nhierarchy. This revolution I should, alas! never survive. But I now\r\nalso take an active part in a great revolution, but one whose true\r\neffects and results will be first developed in the course of\r\ncenturies. For you know, Mr. Taillandier, according to my\r\ntheory--which recognizes no Gods, and, consequently, no miracles in\r\nthe sphere of politics--according to my theory, of which you know and\r\nunderstand nothing, though you assume to pass judgment on me instead\r\nof studying me, if TIME and SPACE are the fundamental conditions of\r\nall being and existence, of all thought and action, of all prosperity\r\nand success. Not that believers in God were wanting to the parliament,\r\nas some one humorously asserted in the Bavarian State\r\ncouncil-chamber--the majority, at least, were believers, and the good\r\nLord always sides with the majority--but because it had no\r\ncomprehension of place or time, on which account it came to such a\r\ndisgraceful and resultless end.\"\r\n\r\nThis, certainly, will appear to most readers to be, despite its\r\nbitterness, a lame and weak apology for neutrality, though we imagine\r\nthat but little good could result from the intensest activity, when\r\ndirected by such principles. Taillandier has also, in his own\r\nunassuming way, done, for so young a man, a full share of work \"in the\r\ngreat revolution, whose true effects and results will be first\r\ndeveloped in the course of centuries.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAUGUST KOPISCH, well known as the collector and translator of\r\n_Agrumi_--a choice selection of Italian Popular Songs--has recently\r\npublished by Ernest and Korn of Berlin, a _Description and Explanation\r\nof the Monument to Frederic the Second_. A far more elegant work on\r\nthe same subject, with no less than twenty excellent views of the\r\nmonument, taken from as many points, appears from Decker, to which we\r\nmay add another by Kohlheim, illustrated with a selection of ancient\r\nand modern poems relative to the memory of \"Old Fritz.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe observe from a prospectus recently sent forth by the publisher, J.\r\nG. Muller, in Gotha, that the _Janus_, a well known and ably edited\r\nquarterly, devoted to medical literature, history, biographies, and\r\nstatistics, the publication of which was suspended in 1848, on account\r\nof the political difficulties which then agitated Germany, is again to\r\nmake its appearance, under the editorial charge of Doctors\r\nBretschneider, Henschel, Hensinger, and Thierfelder, who will be aided\r\nin their efforts by many learned correspondents and contributors in\r\ndifferent countries. Like most revived publications, it will be\r\npublished in a style superior to its original, and to judge from the\r\ntype and paper of the prospectus, which is given as a specimen of that\r\nwith which the work is to be issued, its appearance will be truly\r\nexquisite.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFRANZ KUGLER the great historian and critic of Art, has made his\r\nappearance in a small _brochure_ of thirty pages, entitled, _Three\r\nArticles upon Theatrical Affairs_,--which, however, appears to have\r\nmet with but little admiration, if we may judge from the hard knock\r\nwhich a reviewer gives it with the word--\"Unpractical as the\r\nsuggestions are, which we find allied to these observations, they\r\nwould still give us no occasion for remark, had not Herr Kugler made\r\nthem a pretence for political discussion.\" Apropos of Kugler we may\r\nobserve that a very excellent work entitled _Denkmaler der Kunst_\r\n(Souvenirs of Art), consisting of very neatly engraved and very\r\nextensive illustrations of Art in all ages and nations, intended\r\nspecially as a companion work to the Berlin professor's _History_, has\r\njust been published for the first time in a compact form by Ebner and\r\nSeubert of Stuttgart. Among its authors or contributors we see the\r\nnames of Dr. Ernst Guhl, Jos. Caspar, and Professor Voit of Munich.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the late JOHANN VON MULLER'S _History of the Swiss\r\nConfederation_ has just appeared from the hands of MM. VULLIEMIN and\r\nMONNARD. The work was commenced in 1786; when Von Muller died it was\r\nbrought down to the year 1489; and it has since been continued by four\r\nother authors in succession. Robert Glutz-Blozheim took up the\r\nnarrative where Von Muller stopped, and continued it to 1516; after\r\nhis death, John Jacob Hottinger described the progress of the\r\nreformation in the German cantons; but on coming to the part which the\r\nFrench cantons took in this great movement, it was decided to employ a\r\nnative of that part of the Confederation, and the work was accordingly\r\ngiven to Louis Vulliemin, who completed the history of the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries. He was followed by E. Monnard, Professor in\r\nthe University of Bonn, who carried it as far as the second peace of\r\nParis, in 1815. Both he and M. Vulliemin had already translated into\r\nFrench the volumes of their German predecessors. Their own volumes are\r\nnow being translated into German, and the entire performance will soon\r\nbe printed in both languages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interesting contribution to the religious and metaphysical history\r\nof Germany in the last generation will be found in the _Autobiography_\r\nof BRETSCHNEIDER, now being published in parts, by his son-in-law\r\nHorst. It is described as a faithful as well as interesting narrative\r\nof the life of its deceased author and subject, who must fill a\r\nprominent place in the history of that great theological development\r\nof which his country has recently been the scene. He was a\r\nrationalist, but without aiming at the rejection or annihilation of\r\nthe Christian supernaturalism. The sense of dependence on God, which\r\nwas the foundation of Schleiermacher's theory, he regarded as stupid\r\nmysticism, and the general tendency of the more recent philosophy as\r\nobscure, abstruse, scholastic, and useless. He was a vigorous and\r\nunsparing controversialist, and the greater part of his writings are\r\nof that character.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR.

A new edition of CLEMENS BRENTANO'S _History of the brave\r\nKasperl and fair Annerl_, has also been published at Berlin by the\r\n\"United Bookselling Establishment,\" with an illustration.\r\nGLASSBRENNER, the humorist, (who is, however, we believe, not\r\nidentical with his Rabelaesian pen-brother BRENNGLASER,) publishes by\r\nSimion of Berlin a third edition of his poems, while the more recent\r\nnumbers of _Die Grenzboten_, the _Monatscrift_ and the _Europa_ are\r\nrich in a variety of articles surpassing in general interest any thing\r\nof the kind which we have for a long time witnessed in German\r\nperiodical literature. It is to be wished that our own literati and\r\nmiscellaneous intellectual purveyors would make a far more extended\r\nuse of these German monthlies than they have hitherto done. Except the\r\n_International_, the _Tribune_ is almost the only periodical in the\r\ncountry that makes any considerable use of the German literary\r\njournals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIMRESI, _die Ungarischen Fluechtlinge in d.

In point of time it reaches\r\nto their departure from Widdin to Shumla. Many articles are added\r\ndrawn from newspapers and private sources, relative to their\r\nadventures, to the fortune of those who have emigrated to America, and\r\nto the influence of England in these matters. A certain chapter on\r\nTurkish manners and customs, containing nothing which has not been\r\nalready better described by other writers, might as well have been\r\nomitted.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHORWALDSEN'S _Jugend_ (or The Youth of Thorwaldsen) is the title of a\r\nwork composed from the correspondence, manuscripts and notes of the\r\nillustrious artist, written originally in Danish by Hans Wachenhufen,\r\nand translated by J. M. Thiele, (if we mistake not, the eminent\r\ntheologian). \"The style and execution is somewhat stiff and dry, which\r\nmay, however, be partly the fault of the translator, who appears to\r\nhave deemed it his duty to condense as much as possible; and has in\r\nconsequence apparently detracted in a degree from the easy,\r\nconfidential tone with which it is inspired. Nor is the translation\r\nentirely free from errors and provincial expressions.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most exquisite works recently published in Germany we\r\nobserve a second greatly augmented and improved edition of _Alte und\r\nneue Kinderlieder Fabeln, Sprueche und Rathseln_, or, Old and New\r\nSongs, Fables, Sayings, and Riddles for Children, with illustrations\r\nby W. von Kaulbach, C. v. Aeideck, G. Konig, A. Kreling, E.\r\nNeureuther, the humorous and popular Graf. v. Poeci, L. Richter, C. H.\r\nSchmolze, M. v. Schwind, Stauber, &c. We have been thus particular in\r\nmentioning these names, that those who have not as yet seen the work\r\nmay form some idea of the excellence of its illustrations. The only\r\nobjection indeed which we have to find is, that the text (despite its\r\ntitle) is too far subordinate to the illustrations. A work of this\r\ndescription should at least have comprised _a majority_ of those songs\r\nheard in every Germany nursery, and which are given with such _naive_\r\ntruthfulness in _Des Knaben Wonderhorn_. In several instances these\r\nold songs were evidently the sources whence the spirit of the\r\nillustration was derived, which illustration is here applied to a\r\nlimited scrap of the original; as for instance, in the exquisitely\r\nspirited and droll picture of _das bucklig's Mannlein_, or the\r\nhump-backed dwarf, by _Schwind_, which is far more applicable to the\r\ndroll, demi, diabolical popular ballad of that name, than to the old\r\nscrap of verse which it over-illustrates. But as an album of admirable\r\ndesigns the work is unrivalled. The engraving of the mother and child\r\nillustrating the ballad of _Schlof Kindlein_ is truly beautiful,\r\nconceived in a spirit of naive fantasie, peculiarly applicable to the\r\nodd yet childlike song. _Das Glocklein im Hersen_, in which Christ is\r\nrepresented as opening the gate of Heaven to a child, by W. Kaulbach,\r\nin its pious, gentle beauty, almost transcends praise. Our notice\r\nalready exceeds limit, yet we cannot leave this gem-book without\r\nspecially and further commending The Toy-dealer of Nuremberg, a\r\nmasterpiece of domestic life, by L. Richter, and _Es staig eim Herr zu\r\nRosse_, or A Rider mounting his Horse, by Schwind, which forcibly\r\nrecall the romantic etchings of Albert Durer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA convention of Sclavic scholars, under the auspices of the Servian\r\nliterary society of _Matica Ilirska_, in Agram, will probably soon be\r\nheld, to consider the possibility of combining the different Sclavic\r\ndialects into one language. This will be extremely difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, on account of the degree of cultivation which the\r\nlanguages of the Sclavic stock have attained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA translation of JOHN MILTON'S _Areopagitica_, a Speech for the\r\nLiberty of unlicensed Printing, to the Parliament of England, in 1644,\r\nhas recently been executed by Dr. RICHARD ROePELL, Professor of History\r\nat the University of Breslau, and published by Veit and Co. of\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"In every revolution, good or bad, there are blind fanatics and\r\nselfish intriguers ready to take part, and loafers and vagabonds\r\n(_Bummler und Gamins_) willing to raise their voices.\" This is the\r\nremark of a German medical critic on a recent hydropathically insane\r\ncomposition, entitled _The Sin-register of the Medical Art of\r\nHealing_. In this work the _servum pecus_ of allopathic physicians are\r\nrichly abused, partly with biblical quotations and partly with\r\noriginal anathemas. Another on the same subject and in the same\r\ncurious style, is entitled, _Gustav Schwab, the noble bard of Suabia_,\r\nby GOTTLOB WASSERMAN (or Praise-God Water-man). In this work the\r\nanti-Sangrado author proves to his own satisfaction, that the _noble\r\nbard_ came to his death in consequence of having been imprudently\r\nbled, on one occasion, some six months previous to his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of June an eighth edition of OSCAR VON REDUITZ'S\r\n_Amaranth_, was announced, and it has already been succeeded by a\r\nninth. Many of the poems in this collection are in Uhland's romantic\r\nvein, and abound in the artistic spirit. To this we may add a\r\n_Mahrchen_ in verse, (or Child's Tale,) a beautiful fantasie of birds,\r\nbrooks, leaves, and sunshine, reminding us at times of _The Story\r\nwithout an End_, at others of Sara Coleridge's _Phantasmion_. But as\r\nit is one of those gilded fascinations which invariably charm on a\r\nfirst perusal, we leave to some more accurate reader the task of\r\njudging more critically as to its literary merit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA translation of Shakspeare's Plays into the Swedish language by\r\nHAGBERG, Professor of Greek in the University of Lund, is now in\r\ncourse of publication. Of this twelve volumes have appeared; and\r\nalthough the first edition consisted of no less than two thousand\r\ncopies, the whole have been sold off, and a second edition is in\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lectures of NEANDER, _On Church History_, etc., are soon to\r\nappear, in fifteen volumes, edited by Professor JULIUS MULLER, of\r\nHalle. The Interpretation of the Gospel of St. John, will form the\r\nfirst part of the work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGerman books and pamphlets on the Crystal Palace and the Great\r\nExhibition, are already in the market, or have indeed been extant for\r\nsome time. _Der Krystall Palast im Hyde Park_, is among the last in\r\nthis line.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. POUSSIN, recently the minister of France to this country, has in\r\npreparation a volume for popular circulation on the comparative merits\r\nof the French and American constitutions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Prussian minister VON RADOWITZ has published a second series of\r\nhis _Dialogues on Church and State_, of which the first series\r\nappeared in 1846.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBARON DUDEVANT, husband of GEORGE SAND, the French papers lately\r\ndeclared had died in an obscure apartment in Paris; but it appears, on\r\nthe contrary, that he is still living, in true baronial style, at his\r\nchateau on the Garonne. A correspondent of the _Tribune_ says, \"he\r\nnever reads his wife's romances, and that his decease was believed in\r\nParis, for several literary gentlemen of eminence are said to have\r\nlaid their hands and fortunes at the feet of the large-hearted woman\"\r\nwho was supposed to be a widow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAUGUSTE COMTE has just published the first volume of a new work, his\r\n_Systeme de Politique Positive_. In his great work, _Philosophie\r\nPositive_, he was forced by his method to proceed objectively--from\r\nthe world up to man; he now proceeds subjectively--from man to the\r\nworld. This system of Positive Polity he calls a Treatise of\r\nSociology, instituting the Religion of Humanity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEMILE DE GIRARDIN announces a new pamphlet, the title of which sets\r\none thinking, _La Revolution Legale par la Presidence d'un Ouvrier_.\r\n(The Revolution Legal through the Presidency of a Workman.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLAMARTINE has published the first volume of _The History of the\r\nRestoration of the Monarchy in France_. It is intended as a sequel to\r\nhis History of the Girondins, and this initial volume comprises the\r\nclosing days of the Empire, the last great struggle of Napoleon with\r\nthe combined armies in 1814, and the abdication at Fontainbleau. The\r\ntone throughout is derived from the partizan feelings of the present\r\ntime. Its characteristic is an elaborate and determined depreciation\r\nof the emperor. The author's apparent ambition is to be striking, and\r\nhe sometimes is successful: to be just or wise is scarcely in his\r\nnature. For ourselves, we are so well acquainted with the life of\r\nNapoleon--with the workings of that most powerful practical\r\nintelligence that God has yet suffered to exist among mankind--that we\r\nare not in any way affected by these efforts of a hungry rhetorician\r\nto disparage him. In his new book, as in his _Girondins_, M. Lamartine\r\nhas not chosen to give us any authorities. What he says as to facts\r\nmay be true, but we have only his word for it; and long ago, before M.\r\nLamartine became a great man in affairs, we learned from his\r\n_Pilgrimage to the Holy Land_, that his word is of very little value.\r\nWe confess an admiration for parts of his _Elvire_ and for some of his\r\nminor poems, but it is the youthful poet we admire, not the author of\r\nthe sickly sentimentalism in his recent romantic memoirs, far less the\r\nhistorian, who to get himself out of difficulties induced by early\r\nextravagancies can play marketable tricks with the most awful shade\r\nthat moves in the twilight of men's memories about the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMICHELET, driven from his chair in the University, is publishing in\r\nthe _Evenement_ his new work, _Legendes de la Democratie_. The preface\r\nis remarkable for its naivete. \"This book,\" he says, \"is the true\r\n_Legendes d'Or_ (golden legend)--free from all alloy, and in it will\r\nbe found nothing but the truth.--Nay more, every one who reads it will\r\nbecome a wiser and a better man.\" A happy author, to have such faith\r\nin his book!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. GUIZOT'S _History of the Representative Form of Government_, is\r\nprepared from a course of lectures delivered by the author in the\r\nreign of Louis the Eighteenth. The preface contains frequent allusions\r\nto the politics of the day, and the eminent author refers in it to his\r\nattempts to reconcile authority with liberty. M. Guizot's style is\r\nclear, but destitute of warmth or ornament, and his works have\r\nreputation chiefly for their judicial carefulness and\r\nhonesty--qualities not so common in France as to be reasonably\r\nneglected there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. PROUDHON, the socialist \"philosopher,\" has written, in the prison,\r\nin which it has been deemed necessary to shut him up, a new work,\r\nentitled _General Idea of Revolution in the Nineteenth Century_. Among\r\nthe topics of which it treats are the Reaction of Revolutions, the\r\nSufficient Reason of Revolution in the Nineteenth Century, the\r\nPrinciple of Association, the Principle of Authority, Organization of\r\nEconomical Forces, and Dissolution of Government under an Economical\r\nOrganization. The elements of every revolutionary history, according\r\nto Proudhon, are the previous regime which the revolution seeks to\r\nabolish, and which, by the instinct of self-preservation, may become a\r\ncounter-revolution; the parties which, according to their different\r\nprejudices and interests, endeavor to turn it to their own advantage;\r\nand the revolution itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. BUSHNAN, of Edinburgh, under the title of _Miss Martineau and her\r\nMaster_, has published a temperate but conclusive refutation of the\r\n_Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development_, by Miss\r\nMARTINEAU and Mr. GEORGE ATKINSON. The shallow performance in which\r\nthese persons displayed their atheism was treated by the learned with\r\ncontempt. Douglass Jerrold said the sum of their doctrine was\r\ncontained in the formula, \"There is no God, and Miss Martineau is his\r\nprophet,\" and those who considered the _Letters_ more seriously, for\r\nthe most part expressed surprise and pity--never any one an\r\napprehension that such wretched stuff could unsettle a conviction of\r\nthe feeblest, or confirm a doubt of the most skeptical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nISAAC TAYLOR, whose \"Natural History of Enthusiasm,\" has been much\r\nread in this country, has in press _Wesley and Methodism_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot long ago it was stated that a Mr. SIMONIDES had discovered at the\r\nfoot of Mount Athos a great number of important Greek MSS. We ventured\r\nto express some doubts on the subject, and we now perceive that Mr.\r\nRHANGABE, Professor of Archaiology in the University of Athens, has\r\npublished a critical examination of these pretended discoveries, in\r\nwhich he proves very satisfactorily that every manuscript of an\r\nancient work which Mr. Simonides has allowed others to examine, and\r\nevery work which he has published, has turned out to be a modern\r\nfabrication. A more real discovery has been made by persons engaged in\r\nremoving the earth for the foundations of a house near the Acropolis.\r\nFragments of inscriptions, and several relics of sculpture and\r\narchitecture, have been dug up, and it is thought they prove that the\r\nsenate house, metroon, and other buildings in which the Athenian\r\narchives were preserved, stood in the vicinity. Apropos of M.\r\nSimonides, in a letter from Constantinople it is alleged that from the\r\nexamination of ancient manuscripts in different Greek convents, he has\r\ndiscovered an indication that the original of the _Acts of the\r\nApostles_ is buried in an island in the Sea of Marmora, and that he\r\nhas caused an application to be made to the Turkish government for\r\nleave to search after it, which, it is said, is opposed by the Greek\r\nPatriarch, from fear that the discovery of the important document may\r\nlead to new schisms in the church!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe mentioned in a recent number of the _International_ the discovery\r\nand publication of a supposed MS. work by Origen. In the June number\r\nof the _Quarterly_ it is carefully reviewed, and in several of the\r\ntheological journals it has received the attention due to a work of\r\nits pretensions. We see now that the Chevalier BUNSEN has in the press\r\nof the Longmans _Five Letters to Archdeacon Hare, on Hypolitus,\r\nPresbyter of the Church of Rome, author of the recently discovered\r\nbook ascribed to Origen, and the bearing of this work on the leading\r\nQuestions of Ecclesiastical History and Polity_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. CROLY has just published a new volume of poems, under the title of\r\n_Scenes from Scripture_. The greater part of them had previously\r\nappeared in annuals, &c. C. B. CAYLEY has given to the world a new\r\nversion of the _Divine Comedy_, in the original terza rhyme; EDMUND\r\nPEEL, a poet of Mr. Robert Montgomery's class, has published _The Fair\r\nIsland_, descriptive of the Isle of Wight; ROBERT MONTGOMERY himself\r\nhas nearly ready his some-time promised _Poetical Works_, for the\r\nfirst time collected into one volume, similar to the octavo editions\r\nof Southey, Wordsworth, &c., including some original minor poems, and\r\na general preface, (only the printing being in the style of\r\nWordsworth.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first of the old historians to be edited in the light of the\r\nmodern discoveries in Assyria, is _Herodotus_, to appear in a new\r\nEnglish version, translated from the text of Gaisford, and edited by\r\nRev. GEORGE RAWLINSON, assisted by Col. RAWLINSON and Sir J. G.\r\nWILKINSON, with copious notes, illustrating the history and geography\r\nby Herodotus, from the most recent sources of information, and\r\nembodying the chief results, historical and ethnographical, which have\r\nbeen arrived at in the progress of cuneiform and hieroglyphical\r\ndiscovery. This edition will be printed for Mr. Murray in four octavo\r\nvolumes. The translation has been undertaken from a conviction of the\r\ninadequacy of any existing version to the wants of the time. The\r\nunfaithfulness of Beloe, and the unpleasantness of his style, render\r\nhis version insufficient in an age which dislikes affectation and\r\nrequires accuracy; while the only others which exist are at once too\r\nclose to the original to be perused with pleasure by the general\r\nreader, and defective in respect of scholarship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR JAMES STEPHEN, whose brilliant contributions to the Edinburgh\r\nReview are familiar through Mr. Hart's Philadelphia edition, has\r\nnearly ready _Lectures on the History of France_, and _The History of\r\nFrance_, compiled, translated and abridged from the works of De\r\nSismondi, and of other recent French authors, and illustrated with\r\nhistorical maps and chronological and other tables.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. S. BUCKINGHAM, the author of fifty volumes of _Travels_, (of which\r\neight large octavos are about our own unfortunate country,) has at\r\nlength succeeded in his long contest with the East India Company for\r\nindemnification for his losses as an oriental journalist. The bill\r\nbefore parliament for restitution has been withdrawn, the court of\r\ndirectors and the government having agreed to settle upon him a\r\npension of four hundred pounds per annum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe perceive that the British government has bestowed a pension of five\r\nhundred dollars a year on Mrs. JAMESON. We think of no Englishwoman\r\nwho is more deserving of such distinction. Mrs. Jameson has spent a\r\npretty long life in the most judicious exercise of her literary\r\nabilities, and as a critic of art she is unquestionably superior to\r\nany woman who has ever written on the subject. One of her most popular\r\nworks, the _Beauties of the Court of Charles the Second_, will be\r\nissued in a splendid edition, with all the original portraits, in a\r\nfew weeks, by the Appletons of this city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM HAMILTON has published _Critical Discussions in\r\nPhilosophy, Literature, and Education with University Reform_, chiefly\r\nfrom the Edinburgh Review, but now corrected, vindicated, and\r\nenlarged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral new books of _Travels_ have lately appeared or are in press in\r\nLondon.

I dedicate it to you as a feeble\r\ntribute of friendship and gratitude that would gladly seek a better\r\nmode of expressing themselves. It may remind you of happy hours that\r\nwe have spent together, and seem to continue some of the tones of our\r\nlong correspondence. _Valeat quantum!_ It could not lay its head upon\r\nthe shelf without a last thought of affection directed to its foster\r\nparent.

One of the forthcoming works is an ingenious composition\r\nby the Rev. Mr. James of the western part of this state, and the other\r\n(to be published by Mr. Dodd) is by a clergyman in Connecticut.\r\nLongmans advertise in London _The Spiritual Exposition of the\r\nApocalypse_, as derived from the writings of Swedenborg, and\r\nillustrated and confirmed by ancient and modern authorities, by the\r\nRev. Augustus Clissold, of Exeter College; and the Rivingtons have in\r\npress a _Commentary on the Apocalypse_ by the Rev. ISAAC WILLIAMS, of\r\nTrinity College.

Our Mr. Collins could have furnished him, as\r\nillustrations for an additional and very interesting chapter, drawings\r\nof the _Pacific_ and the _Baltic_, which would perhaps make the work a\r\n\"just exposition of the supremacy\" of American ship-building, of which\r\nthis Mr. Finchman seems never to have been informed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf collections of Letters on Affairs, that to be published immediately\r\nby Mr. Murray, under the title of the _Grenville Papers_, promises to\r\nbe among the most important.

SHREVE, for the last\r\nten or twelve years one of the editors of the _Louisville Daily\r\nJournal_, and for twenty years well and most favorably known by\r\nfrequent and elegant contributions to western literature. _Drayton_,\r\nwe are advised, is not one of those easy pieces of writing which are\r\nknown as very hard reading, but has engaged the attention of the\r\nauthor, at periods of comparative leisure, for several years past.\r\nWithin a few months it has been entirely recast and rewritten; and, if\r\nour correspondent be not very partial in his judgment of the merits of\r\nthe work, the public will find in its patriotic and democratic pages a\r\nmine of poetry and fine reflection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words more of _American Reviews_. The subject is important; a\r\ngreat periodical in which the best intelligence of the country shall\r\nhave expression, is necessary, for many purposes, and never was more\r\nnecessary than now. The _Princeton Review_, the _Christian Review_,\r\nthe _Biblical Repository_, the _Bibliotheca Sacra_, the _Methodist\r\nQuarterly Review_, the _Church Review_, _Brownson's Quarterly Review_,\r\nand several others, are in large degrees devoted to particular\r\nreligious interests, and though for the most part conducted with much\r\nlearning and discretion, do not altogether serve the purpose for which\r\nan American Review of Literature and Affairs is demanded. The _North\r\nAmerican_, as we have before intimated, has no character; it\r\noccasionally has good articles, but it has no principles; it is\r\nsectional, which is pardonable, but displays neither the knowledge nor\r\nthe tact necessary to a sectional organ. The mineral riches of our\r\nlake region, plans for connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific, the\r\nCuban question, our relations with other republics, the extraordinary\r\nphenomena of Mormonism, the efforts of certain American women to unsex\r\nthemselves, and numerous other subjects of present interest in this\r\ncountry, have been amply discussed in British and other European\r\nReviews during the last year, but not one of them has been mentioned\r\nin the work to which, from its pretentions, readers would naturally\r\nlook for its most masterly exposition. It may be said that the _North\r\nAmerican_ is devoted to philosophy, learning, and literature rather\r\nthan to affairs: we have heard this defence, even in the face of its\r\nelaborate papers on Hungary and Austria; but let us see how it\r\noccupies such a ground: the bright and especial intellectual boast and\r\nglory of New England is Jonathan Edwards, of whom Dr. Chalmers says\r\nthat he was \"the greatest of theologians,\" Sir James Mackintosh that\r\n\"in power of subtle argument he was perhaps unmatched, certainly was\r\nunsurpassed among men,\" Dugald Stewart that \"he cannot be answered,\"\r\nand Robert Hall that he was the \"mightiest of mankind:\" such a\r\ncharacter was undoubtedly worthy of its criticism, but in the half\r\ncentury of its existence the _North American_ has never once noticed\r\nhim! We have an illustration much more pertinent, especially in as far\r\nas the present editor of the _Review_ is concerned: The late Hartley\r\nColeridge was a man of peculiar and very interesting qualities, and it\r\nmay be admitted that he possessed considerable genius; but a pretence\r\nthat his life was as remarkable or that his abilities as displayed in\r\nhis writings were as eminent as those of Edgar A. Poe, who died about\r\nthe same time, would be simply ridiculous; yet we believe every\r\nquarterly and nearly every monthly Review published in Great Britain\r\nhas had its article on Hartley Coleridge, while even the name of Edgar\r\nA. Poe has never appeared in our self-styled \"great national journal.\"\r\nAnd Maria Brooks, admitted by Southey, Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Fitz\r\nGreene Halleck, and many other masters of literary art, to have been\r\nthe greatest poet of her sex who ever wrote in any language or in any\r\nage, though she was born and educated in the shadow of the college in\r\nwhich more than one of the editors of the _North American_ have been\r\nprofessors, was never once honored with its recognition.\r\n\r\nWe do not know that it will strike others so, but it seems to us that\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, John C. Calhoun, Hugh S. Legare, R. H. Wilde, J. J.\r\nAudubon, Mathew L. Davis, Albert Gallatin, Henry Inman, Chancellor\r\nKent, Dr. Judson, Dr. Jarvis, Dr. Morton, Dr. Troost, M. M. Noah, Mrs.\r\nOsgood, and many other Americans who have recently completed variously\r\nillustrious lives, and so come before the world for a final judgment,\r\nare subjects quite as deserving and appropriate for the _North\r\nAmerican Review_, as those which it has been accustomed to pick up in\r\nthe byways of the literary world abroad; and we cannot understand why\r\nthe facts connected with our own development and destiny, facts which\r\nengross and baffle the attention of the profoundest thinkers in the\r\nolder nations, should give place in the only Review we possess, to\r\nsuch foreign, antiquated, and altogether unimportant topics as\r\ncontinually occupy its pages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. JAMES W. WARD, of Cincinnati, a short time ago delivered before\r\none of the literary institutions of Ohio, a poem on _Woman_, which has\r\nbeen noticed in terms of high commendation. A correspondent who heard\r\nit says it was devoted in about equal parts to the foibles and the\r\nvirtues of the sex, the former of which it laid bare with a most\r\ntrenchant blade, while the latter it portrayed with elegance of\r\ndiction, and an evident love for all that is pure, elevated, and\r\nbeautiful in woman's proper character. The slave of fashion, the\r\npolitician in petticoats, and the \"bloomer\" in br---- pettiloons, the\r\nfemale \"progressive,\" the scold, the slattern, and the butterfly, were\r\nall held up to merited rebuke: then came \"the true woman,\" whose\r\ncharacter as sister, wife, mother, friend, and \"comforter,\" was dwelt\r\non long and fondly, and portrayed in the language of true poetry and\r\nmanly devotion. Mr. Ward is not much known out of the literary circles\r\nof the West, but several of his short poems have had a wide\r\ncirculation in this country and in England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA volume entitled _Novellettes of the Musicians_, has been published\r\nby Cornish, Lamport, & Co., with Mrs. ELLET's name on the title-page\r\nas its author, but most of its contents are translated from the\r\nGerman, and the rest are hardly worth claiming. Yet the book\r\naltogether is entertaining, and is handsomely executed, with several\r\nstriking portraits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. HUNTINGTON, once a village doctor, then a congregational\r\nminister, next an Episcopal clergyman, and now a Catholic priest, made\r\nhis mark a year or two ago in the novel of _Alice or the Mysteries_,\r\nin which there was displayed a great deal of talent as well as a very\r\npeculiar morality. He has just added to his works (by Putnam) a tale\r\ncalled _Alban_, in which a hero somewhat like himself is conducted\r\nthrough various pursuits into the faith, and by pleasantly related\r\nvicissitudes to a good condition. The scene is in New-York and\r\nNew-Haven, and of Roman Catholic novels we know of scarcely one more\r\nreadable. Mr. Huntington perhaps gives us a reflection of his\r\nexperience in this advice addressed to one of his characters:\r\n\r\n     \"That is why I turn to literature with such predilection,\"\r\n     said the young man, greatly excited by Mr. De Groot's way of\r\n     talking. \"Letters,\" resumed Mr. De Groot, after a long\r\n     glance around his endless book-shelves, \"are a pursuit that\r\n     surpasses every other, in enjoyment, and nearly every other\r\n     in dignity. We must have our own literary men. We can't\r\n     afford to let other nations write our books for us. That\r\n     were worse than policy which would hire them to fight our\r\n     battles. There is a thought and there is a sentiment which\r\n     belongs to _us_, and which we are in a manner bound to\r\n     elicit. But--I am sorry to interpose so many _buts_, young\r\n     sir--you are to consider that you must live. You cannot live\r\n     by literature. It is difficult any where, but in this\r\n     country it is impossible. As pride distinguishes the\r\n     Spaniard, revenge the Italian, lust the Saxon, and\r\n     sanguinary violence (they say) the Celt, so pecuniary\r\n     injustice is our national trait, we steal the author's right\r\n     in every book we publish, native or foreign. Now, Atherton,\r\n     you can't live by a craft where people hold themselves at\r\n     liberty to _steal_ what you have produced.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe mentioned a month or two ago the intention of Mr. Russell, of\r\nCharleston, to publish the _Poetical Writings_ of WILLIAM GILMORE\r\nSIMMS, and we are pleased to see in the _Southern Literary Gazette_\r\nthe announcement that they will appear in two handsome duodecimos of\r\nfrom three to four hundred pages each. The publisher remarks very\r\njustly in his advertisement that \"the works of Mr. Simms recommended\r\nthemselves peculiarly to the South, as illustrating its history, its\r\ntraditions and legends, its scenery and its sentiments.\" In the North\r\nthey will be welcomed by the author's numerous friends, and by all\r\nlovers of poetry, for their manly tone, imagination, and frequent\r\nelaborate elegance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. TYNG has added to the _Memoir of the late Rev. Edward\r\nBickersteth_, by the Rev. T. R. BIRKS, an introductory chapter, and\r\nthe work has been published in two volumes, by the Harpers. Mr.\r\nBickersteth was one of the most excellent and most interesting men in\r\nthe English church, and this well-written memoir will have a place\r\namong standard religious biographies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Home Book of the Picturesque_, to be published by Mr. Putnam,\r\nwill be upon the whole the most beautiful souvenir volume of the year.\r\nThe engravings are from pictures of the Bay of New York, by H.\r\nBeckwith; the Clove, Cattskill, by Durand; the Alleghanies, North\r\nCarolina, by Richards; Snow Scene on the Housatonic, by Gignoux;\r\nCattskill Scenery, by Kensett; Schroon Lake, by Cole; West Rock, New\r\nHaven, by Church; Adirondach Mountains, by Durand; the Juniatta,\r\nPennsylvania, by Talbot; Cascade Bridge on the Erie Railroad, by\r\nTalbott; the Rondout, by Huntington; Church at West Point, by Weir;\r\nWa-wa-yanda Lake, by Cropsey, &c., and these are illustrated with\r\nletter-press by Miss Cooper, Fenimore Cooper, Irving, Bryant, Willis,\r\nBayard Taylor, Magoon, Bethune, and one or two persons quite unworthy\r\nof the association to which the publisher admits them. The _Book of\r\nHome Beauty_, also to be issued by Mr. Putnam, we judge from a few\r\nproofs of Mr. Martin's pictures which we have seen, will be a much\r\nmore attractive volume than any \"Book of Beauty\" ever published\r\nabroad. The text of this is all from the pen of Mrs. Kirkland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Popular Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature_, by the Rev. Dr.\r\nKITTO, has been republished in a fine large octavo, with numerous\r\nillustrations by Gould, Kendall & Lincoln, of Boston. We have had\r\nfrequent occasion to praise the abilities, learning, and excellent\r\ntaste of Dr. Kitto, who is one of the most attractive writers and most\r\njudicious editors engaged in the illustration of the Scriptures. We\r\nthink the present work will become the most common of all the Bible\r\nDictionaries, as it probably is the best.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Redfield has reprinted in a style quite equal to that of the\r\noriginal London edition, the second series of _Episodes of Insect\r\nLife_, by ACHETA DOMESTICA. This volume relates to insect life in the\r\nsummer, and is as entertaining as a romance. We have never read a more\r\nattractive book in natural history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. POMEROY JONES, of Westmoreland, in this state, has in press at\r\nUtica, a _History of Oneida County_, in the preparation of which he\r\nhas been engaged several years, and the professors of Hamilton College\r\nhave in preparation a Natural History of the County, embracing its\r\nGeology, Botany, Zoology, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA volume of _Poems_ by MRS. REBECCA S. NICHOLS, of Cincinnati, will,\r\nwe understand, be issued for the next holidays. Mrs. N. has some warm\r\nadmirers, and this volume is to contain her best productions. We hope\r\nits success may equal its deserts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fine, thoughtful _Essays Written in the Intervals of Business_,\r\nhave been reprinted by A. D. F. Randolph, of this city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. ISAAC LEESER, one of the Jewish ministers of Philadelphia,\r\nwhom we have long known as a scholar and man of talents, is engaged on\r\na new translation of the Old Testament, on the basis of the common\r\nEnglish version, carefully corrected and improved according to the\r\nbest Jewish authorities. It is intended by Mr. Leeser so to render the\r\nHebrew text that but few explanatory notes will be needed, and he\r\nreasonably hopes that his edition will be commonly adopted by the Jews\r\nof this country. Dr. KENRICK, the Roman Catholic Bishop of\r\nPhiladelphia, has just published (by Dunigan & Brother, New-York,)\r\n_The Epistles and the Apocalypse_, from the Vulgate, having previously\r\ngiven to the public a translation of the Gospels; and Dr. Alexander of\r\nPrinceton, and several other men of learning, have lately been\r\noccupied with new versions of particular portions of the sacred\r\nvolume. It is well known, too, that a society, composed for the most\r\npart of members of one of the largest and most respectable\r\ndenominations of Christians, has been established mainly for the\r\npurpose of publishing a revised version of the Bible, but it is not\r\nprobable that this society will ever accomplish any thing more than an\r\nincreased \"contempt for God's word and commandment.\" The specimens we\r\nhave of its scholarship might justify some merriment if they were\r\nconnected with something less venerable and sacred.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves we are content with the Bible as it is, and cannot help\r\na feeling of regret that any who profess to be governed by its wisdom\r\nare disposed to treat it with so little reverence. Undoubtedly there\r\nare some slight verbal inaccuracies in the common version, but they\r\nare understood, or may be easily explained in notes: we want here no\r\ninnovations, no improvements, no progress, except in the observance of\r\nthe good we understand. Nevertheless, we see with pleasure all the\r\nstudies with which really learned men illustrate their convictions of\r\nthe significance of the original. For the chief portion of mankind, in\r\nthis night in which we live, the sun does not shine with its original\r\nsplendor, but it is reflected on us by the moon, and we care not how\r\nmany thousand stars reflect it also according to their capacity.\r\n\r\nA new version, by which it is _not proposed to displace the common\r\none_, is to appear from the press of Mr. Colby, in this city, and the\r\nhigh reputation of its author for learning and judgment, is a\r\nsufficient assurance that what he does at all he will do in a very\r\nmasterly manner. The Rev. Dr. Conant, Professor of Biblical Literature\r\nin the University of Rochester, says in a letter to his publisher:\r\n\r\n     \"It has long been a favorite object with me to furnish a\r\n     translation of the Holy Scriptures for unlearned readers,\r\n     which should accurately express the meaning of the original\r\n     by the aids of modern scholarship in the style and manner of\r\n     the early English versions. The translation is intended,\r\n     therefore, for the benefit of the common reader of the\r\n     Scriptures, to aid him in more clearly understanding them\r\n     wherever our common version is for any reason obscure. In\r\n     other words, it is to do directly by a translation what has\r\n     long been attempted by the awkward and circuitous method of\r\n     a commentary; viz. to make the Scriptures plain to the\r\n     unlearned reader. I should for many reasons regard it as\r\n     undesirable, and it certainly is impracticable, to supplant\r\n     the common version to any extent as the received version for\r\n     the church and the people, or the common English Bible and\r\n     common standard of appeal for those who use only the English\r\n     language.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Conant will preserve as nearly as may be the manner of the old\r\ntranslations, endeavoring only to combine the fidelity and exactness\r\nof modern scholarship with the simplicity and strength of the common\r\nversion. To such an effort, by such a man, we see no objections. The\r\nreputation most at stake is that of Dr. Conant himself, and those who\r\nknow him do not fear that that will suffer. It will at least be\r\ninteresting to mark the differences between his renderings and those\r\nof King James's translators.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Putnam publishes for the coming holidays a new impression of the\r\n_Memorial_, which is incomparably the most interesting literary\r\nmiscellany ever printed as a gift-book in this country. The proceeds\r\nof the sale, it is known, are to be appropriated for the erection of a\r\nmonument to the late Mrs. Osgood, in Mount Auburn Cemetery. The book\r\nis made up of original articles by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Chancellor\r\nWalworth, N. P. Willis, Bishop Doane, G. P. R. James, S. G. Goodrich,\r\nJohn Neal, W. G. Simms, Richard B. Kimball, George P. Morris, Dr.\r\nMayo, Mrs. Sigourney, Mrs. Embury, Mrs. Oakes Smith, Mrs. Hewitt, Mrs.\r\nLynch, and indeed all the best and most brilliant writers of the time;\r\nand it is beautifully illustrated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe well-known private library of the late Rev. Dr. SAMUEL FARMER\r\nJARVIS is to be sold in this city, by Messrs. Lyman & Rawdon, about\r\nthe beginning of October. In several departments of sacred and\r\nclassical literature it is one of the finest collections in America,\r\nand it will probably attract large numbers of buyers, especially from\r\namong the lovers of mediaeval scholarship and theology.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. MITCHELL'S new book, the _Diary of a Dreamer_, is in press by\r\nCharles Scribner, and the same publisher will issue for the holidays\r\nan edition of the _Reveries of a Bachelor_, admirably illustrated by\r\nDarley, who seems indeed never to have done better than in some of his\r\ndesigns for it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. LONGFELLOW has in the press of Ticknor, Reed and Fields, of\r\nBoston, a new poem, entitled _The Golden Legend_. It is the longest of\r\nhis poetical works, making some 350 pages, and will soon be given to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is this year a very remarkable number of new books illustrative\r\nof the applications of science to mechanics. Every man seems\r\ndetermined to master the learning which can be turned to account in\r\nhis vocation, and the booksellers are quite willing to aid them. We\r\nsuppose the most generally and importantly useful work of this kind\r\never printed is Appleton's _Dictionary of Machinery, Mechanics, Engine\r\nWork, and Engineering_, just completed in two very large compactly\r\nprinted and profusely illustrated octavo volumes. In this great work\r\nare gathered the best results of the study and experiment of the\r\nworkers of the world. It is a cyclopedia of inventions, in which one\r\nmay be sure of finding described the best processes yet discovered for\r\ndoing every thing that is to be done by means of mechanics. The\r\nbenefits conferred on the country by this publication must be very\r\ngreat; its general circulation would mark a new period in our physical\r\nadvancement, and to a degree influence our civilization, since there\r\nis no country in the world in which every resource is so readily\r\napplied to purposes of comfort and culture. If knowledge is power, as,\r\nmisquoting Lord Bacon, it is every day asserted, the truth is most\r\nconspicuous in the range of those arts and occupations illustrated by\r\nthese incomparable volumes, which should be in the house of every man\r\nwho has already provided himself with the Bible and Shakspere. The\r\nAppletons also publish a _Mechanics' Magazine_, edited in a very\r\nadmirable manner, and we understand it is largely sold.\r\n\r\nNext to the Appletons, we believe the largest publisher in this line\r\nis Henry C. Baird, of Philadelphia, who has now in press a _Handbook\r\nof Locomotive Engineers_, by SEPTIMUS NORRIS, of the celebrated house,\r\nNorris & Brother, engine manufactures; _The Practical Metal Worker's\r\nAssistant_, by M. HOLTZAPHFEL, illustrated with many engravings, and\r\nenlarged by the addition of American matters; SCOTT's _Cotton\r\nSpinner_, thoroughly revised by an American editor; a new edition of\r\nMr. OVERMAN's important book on _Iron; The Practical Model\r\nCalculator_, for the engineer, machinest, manufacturer, &c., by Mr.\r\nBYRNE, (to be issued in twelve semi-monthly numbers); a _Treatise on\r\nthe American Steam-Engine_, by the same author; and several other\r\nbooks of this class.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Appletons will publish in a few weeks _The Women of Early\r\nChristianity_, one of that series of splendidly illustrated volumes\r\ncomposed of _Our Saviour and his Apostles_, _The Women of the Bible,\r\n&c._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBRAITHWAITE'S _Retrospect of Practical Medicine_, in consequence of an\r\narrangement just entered into, will hereafter be published by Stringer\r\n& Townsend, who will issue it with promptness, correctness, and\r\ngeneral mechanical excellence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJames Munroe & Co. of Boston are proceeding regularly with Mr.\r\nHUDSON's excellent edition of Shakspeare, and they have lately issued\r\namong several handsome volumes an edition of the works of George\r\nHerbert.

LYMAN BEECHER, D.D.\r\nwhich they will publish in some half-dozen octavo volumes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe approaching Trade Sales will be the largest ever held in\r\nNew-York.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Rene Taillandier, Professor of Belles Lettres at the College of\r\nMontpellier, declared by the _Allgemeine Zeitung_ to be more familiar with\r\nGerman politics and literature than any other Frenchman living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fine Arts._\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWERS, in a letter to a friend in this city, says with satirical\r\nhumor, of his favorite work, \"Eve is an old-fashioned body, and not so\r\nwell formed and attractive as are her granddaughters,--at least some\r\nof them. She wears her hair in a natural and most primitive manner,\r\ndrawn back from the temples, and hanging loose behind, thus exposing\r\nthose very ugly features in women. _Her waist is quite too large for\r\nour modern notions of beauty_, and her feet, they are so very broad\r\nand large! And did ever one see such long toes! they have never been\r\nwedged into form by the nice and pretty little shoes worn by her\r\nlovely descendents. But Eve is very stiff and unyielding in her\r\ndisposition: _she will not allow her waist to be reduced by bandaging,\r\nbecause she is far more comfortable as she is_, and besides, she has\r\n_some regard for her health, which might suffer from such restraints\r\nupon her lungs, heart, liver, &c., &c., &c._ I could never prevail\r\nupon her to wear modern shoes, for she dreads corns, which, she says,\r\nare neither convenient nor ornamental. But some allowance ought to be\r\nmade for these crude notions of hers,--founded as they are in the\r\nprejudices and absurdities of _primitive_ days. Taking all these\r\nthings into consideration, I think it best that she should not be\r\nexhibited, as it might subject me to censure, and severe criticisms,\r\nand these, too, without pecuniary reward.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the death of WORDSWORTH, a committee was formed among his\r\nfriends for the purpose of setting up a tablet to his memory in\r\nGrassmere Church, where he is buried. The work intrusted to Mr. Thomas\r\nWoolner, has been completed. Surmounted by a band of laurel leaves is\r\nthe inscription, written by Professor Keble; under which the poet's\r\nhead is sculptured in relief. The likeness to the man has received\r\npraise from persons whose verdict is final; the intellectual likeness\r\nto the poet will be more widely appreciated, and recognized with\r\ncordial admiration. The meditative lines of the face, the thoughtful\r\nforehead and eye, the compressed, sensitive mouth, are rendered with\r\nrefined intelligence. In two narrow spaces at each side of the head,\r\nare introduced the crocus and celandine, and the snowdrop and violet,\r\ntreated with a rare union of natural beauty and sculpturesque method\r\nand subordination. Throughout, the delicately studied execution shows\r\nthat the work has been a labor of love.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLEUTZE'S great historical picture of Washington Crossing the Delaware\r\nbefore the Battle of Trenton, has been received in this city by\r\nMessrs. Goupil & Co. and will soon be exhibited to the public. These\r\npublishers will give us a large and fine engraving of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGREENOUGH'S noble group for the capitol, upon which he has been\r\nengaged nearly twenty years, is so nearly finished that it may be\r\nexpected in the United States before the end of November. The subject\r\nis a contrast of the Anglo-Saxon with the Indian. The group is\r\ncomposed of an American Hunter, in the act of seizing an Indian who\r\nwas about to tomahawk a mother and her infant. The white man has\r\napproached the savage from behind, and, having seized him by the arms,\r\nand pressed him with bending knees to the ground, stands frowning\r\nabove his subjugated foe, who, with his head thrown back, gazes upward\r\nat his conqueror with surprise and terror. At their feet a woman,\r\npressing a child to her bosom, sinks in alarm and agony. The effect is\r\nvery imposing, having something of the dignity and grandeur which\r\nbelong to the works of Michael Angelo. In Italy the work has much\r\nincreased Greenough's previous great reputation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA monument is to be erected at Dresden to the composer VON WEBER. To\r\ndefray the expenses, performances are to be given at the various\r\ntheatres in Germany, and the proceeds formed into a fund for that\r\npurpose. Large sums are expected from this source, as also from\r\nprivate contributions throughout Europe. The monument is to be\r\nsurmounted by a statue of the composer, by Rietschel, who was an\r\nintimate friend of his. It will be of bronze, eight feet high, and\r\nplaced on a pedestal of the same metal, ornamented with bas-reliefs.\r\nThe site chosen for its erection is immediately opposite the principal\r\nentrance to the Royal Theatre of Dresden.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe distinguished painter CORNELIUS has been solicited by the Belgian\r\nAcademy of Art to send the grand cartoons on which he is employed, to\r\nthe great Belgian Exhibition. Cornelius, however, fears to risk these\r\ndrawings, the work of ten years, on a journey of such length, since\r\ntheir loss could not be replaced. They already fill two large halls,\r\nand will remain a lasting monument of the painter's genius, even if\r\nthe Cathedral, in which they are to appear as frescoes, should not be\r\nerected during his life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe publication of a work entitled _The Twelve Virgins of Raphael_,\r\nhas been commenced in Paris. It will be in twelve numbers, each\r\ncontaining an engraving and letter-press description and history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA sculptor of Paris has received orders from the Greek Government to\r\nexecute marble busts of Admirals de Rigny and Codington, to be placed\r\nin the Salle where the Senate holds its sittings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historical Review of the Month._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe August elections, though in general not very warmly contested,\r\nhave attracted much attention.

The\r\nConstitution has yet to be submitted to a vote of the people, but of\r\nits acceptance no doubt appears to be entertained. It is to be voted\r\nfor on the 23d of October.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, accompanied by the Secretaries of\r\nWar and Interior, has been received with much enthusiasm in various\r\nplaces in eastern Virginia, through which he passed on his way to the\r\nWhite Sulphur Springs. The Secretary of State has been passing a few\r\nweeks among the lakes and mountains of New Hampshire, where he will\r\nremain probably till October; and the Secretary of the Treasury has\r\nbeen detained by ill health at his residence in Ohio.\r\n\r\nReports from the various agricultural districts of the Union indicate\r\nthat the wheat harvest of 1851 will be the heaviest ever raised. In\r\nNew-York, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, the yield is very large,\r\nand the wheat excellent. In the Northern and Central Illinois, heavy\r\nrains have destroyed a portion of the crop, but in the Southern\r\nportion of the State it will be abundant. In Ohio, advices from all\r\nquarters of the State show that the wheat crop of the present season\r\nwill be the largest ever grown in the State. In Iowa, the yield is\r\nindifferent. Of corn there will probably be an average crop. Potatoes\r\nin several parts of the country have suffered from the rot.\r\n\r\nThe cholera prevails to some extent in the valley of the Mississippi,\r\nand other parts of the Southern and Western States. Among the Sioux\r\nIndians it has been very fatal. The treaty just formed with the Sioux\r\nIndians, secures to the United States all the land in the entire\r\nvalley of the Minnesota, and the eastern tributaries of the Sioux,\r\nestimated at 21,000,000 of acres.\r\n\r\nFrom Texas, we learn that there has been great excitement at Rio\r\nGrande, in consequence of the Mexicans refusing to surrender a\r\nfugitive slave. It is said that 2,000 slaves have made their escape\r\ninto Mexico.\r\n\r\nThere have been several arrivals from California, and by every one\r\nevidence has been furnished of a very unfortunate condition of\r\naffairs. Dissatisfied with the manner in which justice is executed, or\r\nperhaps with a view to the complete overthrow of the government, large\r\nnumbers of men have associated themselves at San Francisco and\r\nelsewhere, and assumed all the functions of a magistracy, treating the\r\nconstituted authorities with contempt, and, in secret assemblies,\r\ndeciding questions of life and of all the highest interests of\r\nsociety. By their directions, several persons accused of crimes have\r\nbeen murdered, and all the officers of the law have been set at\r\ndefiance. In other respects, the news from California and other parts\r\nof the Pacific coast is without remarkable features; the general\r\nprosperity continues in mining, agriculture, and trade; and such is\r\nthe energy of the inhabitants of that city, that San Francisco has\r\nnearly recovered from the effects of the disastrous fires with which\r\nit has been visited. The arrival at New-York, on the 13th of August,\r\nof the steamer Prometheus, in 29 days from San Francisco, by the new\r\nroute of Lake Nicaragua and the river San Juan, establishes the\r\npracticability and advantages of this route. The shortest trip ever\r\nmade by the Panama route, it is said, was in 31 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBA.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States have been kept in a state of\r\nexcitement during a portion of the last month by reports of a\r\nrevolution in the Island of Cuba. It is not yet possible to discover\r\nvery clearly, what are the facts, but it is certain, that there were\r\ninsurrectionary movements commencing about the 4th of July, in several\r\nparts of the Island; that they were badly planned, and inefficiently\r\nexecuted, and that the whole attempt, having caused the ruin of a vast\r\nnumber of persons, is at an end, and has resulted in the firmer\r\nestablishment of the Spanish authority.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Government persists in its refusal to concede the\r\nnavigation of the St. Lawrence to foreign vessels till it obtains an\r\nequivalent from the United States. A motion against removing the\r\nExecutive Government to Quebec, until after the expiration of four\r\nyears from the time of its removal to Toronto, has been negatived the\r\nHouse of Commons by a vote of 48 to 12. It is believed that the\r\nremoval will be decided on during the present season.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICO.\r\n\r\nThe financial embarrassments of the government and people engross the\r\ngeneral attention, and though it has been believed that a scheme of\r\nadministration for augmenting the revenue would be successful, yet the\r\ncountry is so unsettled, and the dissatisfaction with the government\r\nso common, and the spirit of revolution so diffused, that only\r\nconfusion and accelerated ruin can very reasonably be predicted of the\r\ncountry. Insurrectionary movements by parties having in view the\r\nrecall and dictatorship of Santa Anna, have been put down in Chiapos\r\nand Tobasco.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIn Buenos Ayres Rosas had been disturbed by the disaffection of\r\nGeneral Urquiza. Rosas was making active preparations to oppose\r\nhostile attacks. The fortieth Anniversary of the Independence of\r\nVenezuela was celebrated at Caraccas with great enthusiasm. Venezuela\r\nremains perfectly tranquil. The insurrection in the Southern Provinces\r\nof New-Grenada has not yet been quelled, and the troops of the\r\nGovernment have suffered a defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPE AND ASIA.\r\n\r\nWe are compelled to abridge our notices of foreign events to a mere\r\nstatement of dates. In ENGLAND the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill finally\r\npassed the House of Lords on the 28th of July, and receiving the royal\r\nsignature became a law. Little other business of importance was\r\naccomplished before the prorogation of Parliament, which took place on\r\nthe 8th of August. In FRANCE the motion for a revision of the\r\nconstitution was rejected in the Assembly at Paris on Saturday, July\r\n19. Out of 736 members, in the Assembly, 724 were present and\r\nvoted--446 in favor of the revision and 278 against it; but as a\r\nmajority of three quarters was required to carry the motion, it\r\nfailed. On the 31st of July the Assembly elected a Committee of\r\nPermanence, consisting of twenty-five of the most dignified of its\r\nmembers, to sit during the vacation, which it was decided should last\r\nfrom the 10th of August to the 4th of November. From RUSSIA we have\r\nnews of an important victory of the Turkomans over the Russian troops\r\nin the harbor of Astrabad, and the Russians have also suffered an\r\nextraordinary and most important defeat in the Caucasus. In ITALY\r\nevery thing is calm, but the oppressions of the ecclesiastical\r\ngovernment are more and more intolerable and outrageous. The Pope has\r\nreturned from his residence at Castel Gandolfo to Rome. The rebellion\r\nin the southern provinces of CHINA appears to be still unchecked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recent Deaths._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. STEPHEN OLIN, D.D. president of the Wesleyan University, died\r\nat Middletown on the 16th of August. He was a native of Vermont, and\r\nwas educated at Middlebury College. He entered the itinerant ministry\r\nin the Methodist Episcopal Church, in 1824, uniting himself with the\r\nSouth Carolina conference. His next two years were spent in\r\nCharleston. His labors proved too severe, and in 1826 he became what\r\nis called in the Methodist Church a supernumerary, with permission to\r\ntravel for the benefit of his health. He was a local preacher for the\r\nsame reason until 1828, but in 1829 resumed his itinerant labors. In\r\n1832 he was again compelled to relinquish the labors the itinerancy\r\nimposed, and was appointed by the Georgia conference a professor in\r\nFranklin College. In 1833 he was elected president of Randolph\r\nCollege, Macon, Geo., which position he held until elected President\r\nof the Wesleyan University. In 1837 he travelled in Europe and the\r\nEast, and on his return published an account of his Travels, in two\r\nvolumes, which were very popular.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBaron de Ledeirir, the celebrated Russian botanist, died at Munich on\r\nthe 23d of July, aged sixty-five. At the early age of nineteen he was\r\nappointed Professor of Botany in the University of Dorpat, and in 1820\r\nhe obtained the botanical chair in the University of St. Petersburg.\r\nIn 1821 he was elected member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, and\r\nby order of the Emperor Alexander undertook to compile the _Russian\r\nFlora_. To collect materials for this great work he spent sixteen\r\nyears in visiting different parts of the vast Empire of Russia, and\r\nwent as far as the frontiers of China and into Siberia. In 1848 the\r\nstate of his health obliged him to take up his residence at Munich.\r\nThere he labored at his _Flora_, and had the satisfaction of\r\ncompleting it two months before his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEdward Quillinan, son-in-law to Wordsworth, and known in the select\r\nrather than in the wide world of letters, as a poet, a scholar, a\r\ncontributor to more than one literary publication, and the author of\r\none or two separate works, died in July.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarriet Lee, the celebrated writer of the \"Canterbury Tales,\" was the\r\nyoungest sister of Sophia Lee, the author of _The Recess_, and of many\r\npopular dramas and novels. These ladies were daughters of John Lee,\r\nwho had been bred to the law, but became an actor of much repute at\r\nCovent Garden Theatre, and ended his life as manager of the Bath\r\nTheatre. Sophia Lee, the elder daughter, who was born more than one\r\nhundred years ago (her sister Harriet, the subject of this notice,\r\nbeing a few years her junior), produced, in 1780, a comedy, entitled,\r\n\"The Chapter of Accidents,\" which was performed with considerable\r\nsuccess. The profits enabled the two sisters to open a school at Bath,\r\nwhich they carried on for many years with high credit and prosperity.\r\nIn 1782 Sophia Lee brought out her most popular novel, _The Recess_,\r\nwhich was followed by other tales, and by _Almayda, Queen of Grenada_,\r\na tragedy, in which Mrs. Siddons acted. Soon after, Harriet Lee\r\npublished the first five volumes of her _Canterbury Tales_. Two of the\r\nstories, _The Young Lady's Tale_, and the _The Clergyman's Tale_, were\r\nwritten by her sister Sophia; the rest by herself. One of these\r\nCanterbury Tales, by Harriet Lee, named _Kruitzner_, became afterwards\r\nfamous for having formed the subject and the plot of Byron's gloomy\r\ntragedy of _Werner_. Harriet Lee's other principal works were the\r\n_Error of Innocence_, a novel; the _Mysterious Marriage_, a play;\r\n_Clara Lennox_, a novel; and a _New Peerage_, begun in 1787. The last\r\ndays of the sisters were passed near Bristol, where Sophia died in\r\n1824, and Harriet on the first of August, 1851.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Julius, the author of an able work on the Prisons and Criminal Law\r\nin the United States, died about the end of July, in London. Dr.\r\nJulius was editor of the Berlin _Zeitungshalle_ during the revolution\r\nof 1848, and was greatly respected for his talents and courage. Kinkel\r\npronounced a touching _oraison funebre_ over his grave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRev Azariah Smith, M.D., missionary of A.B.C.F.M. to the Armenians,\r\ndied at Aintab, Syria, in the early part of June, in the 35th year of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeneral Henry A. S. Dearborn, of Roxbury, died suddenly at Portland,\r\nMe., on the twenty-ninth of July. He was a native of New-Hampshire,\r\nand was born March 3d, 1783, and removed with his father to the county\r\nof Kennebec in Maine in 1784. His father having been twice elected to\r\nCongress from the Kennebec district, prior to 1801, and on the\r\naccession of Mr. Jefferson to the Presidency, appointed Secretary of\r\nWar, his son Henry was taken to Washington, and educated at the\r\nCollege of William and Mary in Virginia. In 1806 he established\r\nhimself in the profession of law, in which he continued but few years,\r\nthe excitements of public life having more attractions for him than\r\nthe quiet pursuit of that profession. He took a prominent part in the\r\npolitics, of the country, filled many important public stations, among\r\nwhich was the collectorship of Boston, in which he succeeded his\r\nfather in 1812, and remained many years. He also distinguished himself\r\nin literature, and by efforts for the promotion of public\r\nimprovements. He was a member of the Convention of Massachusetts for\r\nrevising the constitution of that state, in 1821, a member of the\r\nGovernor's Council in 1831, member of Congress in 1832,\r\nAdjutant-General of Massachusetts in 1835, and at the time of his\r\ndeath Mayor of Roxbury. He was a man of fine manners, cultivated mind,\r\nand liberal views. While he held the office of Collector of Boston, he\r\nimproved the favorable opportunity to collect statistics relative to\r\nthe commerce of the country, and particularly that to countries\r\nconnected with the Mediterranean, which he embodied in a valuable\r\nwork, entitled _The Commerce and Navigation of the Black Sea_, in\r\nthree volumes octavo. In 1839 he published a series of letters _To the\r\nSecretary of the State of Massachusetts, on the Internal Improvements\r\nand the Commerce of the West_, containing extremely valuable\r\ninformation on those subjects. He recently published a life of the\r\n_Apostle Elliot_, to aid in the construction of a monument in Roxbury\r\nto the memory of that celebrated missionary, and among his other\r\npublished writings is a _Life of Commodore Bainbridge_. He left in MS.\r\na work on Architecture, another on Flowers, and an extended Memoir of\r\nhis Father, embodying all his journal in his expedition through Maine\r\nto Canada, his imprisonment in Quebec, and a vast deal of other\r\nRevolutionary matter. He was constantly throwing off essays in various\r\nperiodicals, to promote the interests of society. Among other claims\r\nupon public gratitude, was his untiring zeal in the cause of\r\nhorticultural and agricultural improvements. Few did more than he to\r\nelevate this important branch of industry. As a politician he was most\r\nprominent for his connection with the Native American party, by which\r\nhe was nominated for the Vice Presidency of the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn another part of this magazine we have given a sketch of the late\r\nDr. MOIR, from the pen of Mr. Gilfillan. The deceased physician and\r\nlitterateur died at Dumfries, on the 6th of July, in the fifty-third\r\nyear of his age, having left his home in Musselburg, near Edinburgh,\r\nto visit in Dumfries his friend, Mr. Aird. Of the poems of \"Delta,\"\r\nProfessor Wilson says: \"Delicacy and grace characterize his happiest\r\ncomposition; some of them are beautiful, in a cheerful spirit that has\r\nonly to look on nature to be happy, and others breathe to simplest and\r\npurest pathos.\" Similar praise was given him by Lord Jeffrey. We do\r\nnot think so highly of his abilities. In verse, Dr. Moir had the fatal\r\ngift of facility, and he cultivated it at the ordinary penalty. His\r\npoetry is not made to survive him. He was a man, however, of varied\r\naccomplishments; and is the author, besides his considerable body of\r\nverse, of a prose narrative, _Mansie Wauch, Tailor of Dalkieth_, a\r\nvery excellent book of _Outlines of the Ancient History of Medicine_,\r\nbeing a View of the Progress of the _Healing Art among the Egyptians,\r\nGreeks, Romans, and Arabians_, and of _Sketches of the Poetical\r\nLiterature of the past Half Century, in Six Lectures_, a work which\r\nhas the sketchy character and incompleteness common to its class. The\r\n_Legend of Genevieve, with other Tales and Poems_, and _Domestic\r\nVerses_, are the two poetical volumes of his which have been published\r\nin a collected form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Roger H. Sheaffe, Bart., died on the 17th July, at\r\nEdinburgh, at the advanced age of 88 years. He entered the army in\r\n1778. In 1798 he became a lieut. colonel, and the next year served in\r\nHolland. He served in the expedition to the Baltic in 1801 under Sir\r\nHyde Parker and Lord Nelson. He also served in North America, and, in\r\n1812, the Americans having invaded Upper Canada, at Queenston, when\r\nGeneral Brock, commanding in the province, fell in an effort to oppose\r\nthe enemy, they posted themselves on a woody height above Queenston.\r\nMajor-General Sheaffe, upon whom the command devolved, assembled some\r\nregular troops and militia, with a few Indians, and on the same day\r\nattacked and completely defeated the Americans, their general\r\ndelivering his sword to Major-General Sheaffe, and surrendering the\r\nsurviving troops on the field of battle, their number far exceeding\r\nthe assailants. For these brilliant services Sir Roger Sheaffe was\r\ncreated a baronet of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLouis Jacques Maude Daguerre, whose name is for ever associated with\r\nthe photographic process, of which he was the discoverer, died on the\r\ntenth of July, in Paris, in the sixty-second year of his age. He was a\r\nman of extreme modesty and great personal worth, and was devoted to\r\nart. He was favorably known to the world before the announcement of\r\nhis discovery of the Daguerreotype. His attempts to improve panoramic\r\npainting, and the production of dioramic effects, were crowned with\r\nthe most eminent success. Among his pictures, which attracted much\r\nattention at the time of their exhibition were, The Midnight Mass,\r\nLand-slip in the Valley of Goldau, The Temple of Solomon, and The\r\nCathedral of Sainte Marie de Montreal. In these the alternate effects\r\nof night and day, and storm and sunshine, were beautifully produced.\r\nTo these effects of light were added others, from the decomposition of\r\nform, by means of which, for example, in The Midnight Mass, figures\r\nappeared where the spectators had just beheld seats, altars, &c., and\r\nagain, as in The Valley of Goldau, in which rocks tumbling from the\r\nmountains replaced the prospect of a smiling valley. The methods\r\nadopted in these pictures were published at the same time with the\r\nprocess of the Daguerreotype, by order of the French Government, who\r\nawarded an annual pension of ten thousand francs to Daguerre and M.\r\nNiepce, jr., whose father had contributed towards the discovery of the\r\nDaguerreotype. Daguerre was led to experiments on chemical changes by\r\nsolar radiations, with the hope of being able to apply the phenomena\r\nto the production of effects in his dioramic paintings. As the\r\nquestion of the part taken by him in the process to which he has given\r\nhis name, has been discussed sometimes to his disadvantage, it appears\r\nimportant that his position should be correctly determined. In 1802,\r\nWedgwood, of Etruria, the celebrated potter, made the first recorded\r\nexperiments in photography; and these, with some additional ones by\r\nSir Humphrey Davy, were published in the journals of the royal\r\ninstitution. In 1814, Mr. Joseph Nicephore Niepce was engaged in\r\nexperiments to determine the possibility of fixing the images obtained\r\nin the camera obscura; but there does not appear any evidence of\r\npublication of any kind previously to 1827, when Niepce was in\r\nEngland. He there wrote several letters to Mr. Bauer, the microscopic\r\nobserver, which are preserved and printed in Hunt's _Researches on\r\nLight_. He also sent specimens of results obtained to the Royal\r\nSociety, and furnished some to the cabinets of the curious, a few of\r\nwhich are yet in existence. These were pictures on metallic plates\r\ncovered with a fine film of resin. In 1824 Daguerre commenced his\r\nresearches, starting at that point at which Wedgwood left the process.\r\nHe soon abandoned the employment of the nitrate and chloride of\r\nsilver, and proceeded with his inquiry, using plates of metal and\r\nglass to receive his sensitive coatings. In 1829 M. Vincent Chevalier\r\nbrought Niepce and Daguerre together, when they entered into\r\npartnership to prosecute the subject in common. For a long time they\r\nappear to have used the resinous surfaces only, when the contrast\r\nbetween the resin and the metal plates not being sufficiently great to\r\ngive a good picture, endeavors were made to blacken that part of the\r\nplate from which the resin was removed in the process of _heliography_\r\n(sun-drawing), as it was most happily called. Amongst other materials,\r\niodine was employed; and Daguerre certainly was the first to notice\r\nthe property possessed by the iodine coating of changing under the\r\ninfluence of the sun's rays. The following letter from Niepce to\r\nDaguerre is on this subject:\r\n\r\n                             \"81, LOUP DE VARENNES, June 23, 1831.\r\n\r\n\"_Sir, and dear Partner_: I had long expected to hear from you with\r\ntoo much impatience not to receive and read with the greatest pleasure\r\nyour letters of the tenth and twenty-first of last May. I shall\r\nconfine myself in this reply to yours of the twenty-first, because,\r\nhaving been engaged ever since it reached me in your experiments on\r\niodine, I hasten to communicate to you the results which I have\r\nobtained. I had given my attention to similar researches previous to\r\nour connection, but without hope of success, from the impossibility,\r\nor nearly so, in my opinion, of fixing in any durable manner the\r\nimages received on iodine, even supposing the difficulty surmounted of\r\nreplacing the lights and shadows in their natural order. My results in\r\nthis respect have been entirely similar to those which the oxide of\r\nsilver gave me; and promptitude of operation was the sole advantage\r\nwhich these substances appeared to offer. Nevertheless, last year,\r\nafter you left this, I subjected iodine to new trials, but by a\r\ndifferent mode of application. I informed you of the results, and your\r\nanswer, not at all encouraging, decided me to carry these experiments\r\nno farther. It appears that you have since viewed the question under a\r\nless desperate aspect, and I do not hesitate to reply to the appeal\r\nwhich you have made.\r\n\r\n                          \"J. N. NIEPCE.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this and other letters it is evident that Niepce had used iodine,\r\nand abandoned it on account of the difficulty of reversing the lights\r\nand shadows. Daguerre employed it also, and, as it appears, with far\r\nmore promise of success than any obtained by M. Niepce. On the fifth\r\nof July, 1833, Niepce died; in 1837 Daguerre and Isodore Niepce, the\r\nson and heir of Nicephore Niepce, entered into a definite agreement;\r\nand in a letter written on the first November, 1837, to Daguerre,\r\nIsodore Niepce says, \"What a difference, also, between the method\r\nwhich you employ and the one by which I toil on! While I require\r\nalmost a whole day to make one design, you ask only four minutes! What\r\nan enormous advantage! It is so great, indeed, that no person, knowing\r\nboth methods, would employ the old one.\" From this time it is\r\nestablished, that although both Niepce and Daguerre used iodine, the\r\nlatter alone employed it with any degree of success, and the discovery\r\nof the use of mercurial vapor to produce the positive image clearly\r\nbelongs to Daguerre. In January, 1839, the Daguerreotype pictures were\r\nfirst shown to the scientific and artistic public of Paris. The\r\nsensation they created was great, and the highest hopes of its utility\r\nwere entertained. On the 15th June, M. Duchatel, Minister of the\r\nInterior, presented a bill to the Chamber of Deputies relative to the\r\npurchase of the process of M. Daguerre for fixing the images of the\r\ncamera. A commission appointed by the Chamber, consisting of Arago,\r\nEtienne, Carl, Vatout, de Beaumont, Toursorer, Delessert (Francois),\r\nCombarel de Leyval, and Vitet, made their report on the third of July,\r\nand a special commission was appointed by the Chamber of Peers,\r\ncomposed of the following peers: Barons Athalin, Besson, Gay Lussac,\r\nthe Marquis de Laplace, Vicomte Simeon, Baron Thenard, and the Comte\r\nde Noe, who reported favorably on the thirtieth July, 1839, and\r\nrecommended unanimously that the \"bill be adopted simply and without\r\nalteration.\" On the nineteenth of August the secret was for the first\r\ntime publicly announced in the Institute by M. Arago, the English\r\npatent having been completed a few days before, in open defiance and\r\ncontradiction of the statement of M. Duchatel to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, who used these words, \"Unfortunately for the authors of this\r\nbeautiful discovery, it is impossible for them to bring their labor\r\ninto the market, and thus indemnify themselves for the sacrifices\r\nincurred by so many attempts so long fruitless. This invention does\r\nnot admit of being secured by patent.\" In conclusion, the Minister of\r\nthe Interior said, \"You will concur in a sentiment which has already\r\nawakened universal sympathy; you will never suffer us to leave to\r\nforeign nations the glory of endowing the world of science and of art\r\nwith one of the most wonderful discoveries that honor our native\r\nland.\" Daguerre never did much towards the improvement of his process.\r\nThe high degree of sensibility which has been attained has been due\r\nto the experiments of others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. DAGUERRE.]\r\n\r\nDaguerre is said to have been always averse to sitting for his own\r\npicture, and there are but few photographs of him in existence. The\r\none from which our engraving is copied was taken by Mr. Meade, of this\r\ncity, and first appeared in the _Daguerrean Journal_, a monthly\r\nperiodical conducted with marked ability by S. D. Humphrey and L. L.\r\nHill, who are distinguished for their improvements upon Daguerre's\r\nprocess. We can refer to no more striking illustration of the advance\r\nof the beautiful art which the deceased discovered, than the existence\r\nof such a work, with more than two thousand subscribers among those\r\nwho are occupied in the production of Daguerreotypes in this country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Lingard, D. D., one of the most deservedly eminent\r\nscholars and writers of the Roman Catholic church in England, and one\r\nof the most distinguished historians of the time, died at Hornby, in\r\nLancashire, on the 17th of July, at the advanced age of 81 years, and\r\nhis remains were buried at Ushaw College, Durham, with which he was\r\nonce officially connected. The deceased priest has left a reputation\r\nthat will probably survive that of any of the persons of his sect who\r\nhave been brought into notice by the recent agitations in England. His\r\ncareer as a controversial writer commenced while he was a young man,\r\nand was continued through a large portion of his laborious life. He\r\nwas an unknown priest at Newcastle-on-Tyne, when, in 1804, he issued\r\nfrom the local press in that town his _History of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nChurch_, a work which constituted the first and most efficient effort\r\nto attract popular attention to those ecclesiastical institutions of\r\nthe Saxons, which are now familiar objects of study and speculation.\r\nIn 1805 he published Catholic Loyalty Vindicated. The next year, the\r\nbishop of Durham, in a charge to his clergy, having attacked the Roman\r\nCatholics, Mr. Lingard answered him, in Remarks on a Charge. This\r\nbrought on a sharp controversy, in which several persons of ability\r\ntook part, and Mr. Lingard published a General Vindication of the\r\nRemarks, with Replies to the Reverend T. Le Mesurier, G. S. Faber, and\r\nothers (1808). These two pamphlets were followed, on the same subject,\r\nby Documents to ascertain the Sentiments of British Catholics in\r\nformer Ages (1812); a Review of certain Anti-Catholic Publications\r\n(1813); and Strictures on Doctor Marsh's Comparative View of the\r\nChurches of England and Rome (1815). In the last of these\r\npublications, Mr. Lingard asserted that the church of England was\r\nmodern, compared with that of Rome; an assertion which so much\r\nirritated the late Doctor Kipling, that he was absurd enough to\r\nthreaten the author with a process in Westminster-hall, if he did not\r\nprove the truth of what he had stated. In 1809 Mr. Lingard published\r\nthe Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church in an enlarged edition.\r\nDoctor Lingard is principally known in foreign countries as the author\r\nof a History of England till the Revolution of 1688, of which ten\r\neditions have appeared and which has been translated into several\r\nlanguages. Although the object of this work is the vindication of the\r\nRoman Catholic church and clergy in England from the alleged\r\nmisrepresentations of Protestant writers, yet it is allowed to be\r\nwritten in a candid and dispassionate tone. As a historian, the author\r\nis acute and perspicuous, judicious in the selection and arrangement\r\nof his materials, and clear and interesting in his narrative. He wrote\r\nfrom original sources, which he examined with care and diligence, and\r\non many points gave new and more correct views of manners, events and\r\ncharacters. In 1826, he published a Vindication, &c., in reply to two\r\narticles in the Edinburgh Review (Nos. 83 and 87, written by Dr.\r\nAllen), charging him with inaccuracy and misrepresentation. A more\r\nfavorable notice of the History appeared in No. 105 of the same\r\nReview.\r\n\r\nThe editions of his History, an English version of the Gospels, and\r\nother learned publications, in pamphlet form, consumed the time\r\nunoccupied by religious duty, or by converse with the neighbors and\r\nfriends, who continually courted his society.\r\n\r\nFor the last forty years Dr. Lingard held the small and retired\r\npreferment belonging to the Roman Catholic Church in the village of\r\nHornby, and there the historian resided, near to Hornby Castle, the\r\nseat of his attached and constant friend, Mr. Pudsey Dawson. After a\r\nlingering illness, he closed in this retirement his mortal career.\r\n\r\nDr. Lingard's residence was a small unpretending building, with three\r\nwindows, connected with a little chapel built by himself, where, till\r\nlast autumn, he regularly officiated. A door of communication opened\r\ninto it from his house, the lower window of which lighted the room\r\nwhere he usually sat, and where he wrote the History of England. His\r\ngarden consisted of a long strip, taken off a small grass field of\r\nabout half an acre in extent. Here he passed much of his time, in the\r\nindulgence of his taste for rural occupations.\r\n\r\nThe private virtues of Dr. Lingard were as remarkable as his public\r\ntalents. His whole habits of life were charmingly simple; his nature\r\nwas kind, his disposition most affectionate. Always they were\r\nagreeable and profitable hours passed in his society, his mind was so\r\nrichly stored, his knowledge so varied, his fund of anecdote so\r\ninexhaustible: a pleasantry and good humor pervaded his conversation\r\nat all times. He never sought controversy in visits among his friends.\r\nWhen questioned on the matters of his own faith, he would speak\r\nfreely; those warmly attached to the Established Church or other\r\ncreeds, widely differing from him in religious principles, never felt\r\nrestraint in his society, or anticipated any sharpness or acrimony. In\r\npersonal appearance he was rather above the middle height, and of\r\nslender frame; and though he had reached to full four-score years, his\r\ndark brown hair was but slightly tinged with gray: his small dark\r\ntwinkling eye was singularly expressive, and his countenance bright\r\nand animated. The annexed portrait is from the miniature taken in\r\n1849, by Mr. Scaife, and engraved for the last edition of the History\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported, though on doubtful authority, that very high\r\npositions in the Roman Catholic Church were more than once offered to\r\nDr. Lingard. There is, it is believed, little or no truth in this; but\r\nthose who knew his simple habits, and his love of retirement, would\r\nnot be surprised at his preferring, even to the purple, his peaceful\r\nresidence in the loveliest locality of the loveliest of England's\r\nnorthern valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. JOHN LINGARD, D. D.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARSHAL SEBASTIANI.]\r\n\r\nHorace Francois della Porta Sebastiana, Marshal of France, and for\r\nsome time Minister of Foreign Affairs under Louis Phillippe, died in\r\nParis on the 14th of July. He was born in Corsica, in 1775, and having\r\nentered the French service in 1792, rose rapidly through the different\r\nranks to that of colonel. Colonel Sebastiani took an active part in\r\nthe revolution of the 18th Brumaire, and, in 1802, the First Consul\r\nsent him on a mission to the Levant. After having brought about a\r\nreconciliation of the differences between the court of Sweden and the\r\nregency of Tripoli, and compelled the Pacha to acknowledge the Italian\r\nrepublic and salute its flag, he repaired to Alexandria, and had an\r\ninterview with General Stewart, in order to insist on the terms of the\r\ntreaty of Amiens for the evacuation of Alexandria. To this demand the\r\nEnglish general replied that he had not received any orders from his\r\ncourt. M. Sebastiani went therefore to Cairo, and in conferences with\r\nthe pacha offered to open a communication with the beys; but the offer\r\nwas not accepted, the orders of the Porte being to make it a war of\r\nextermination. He afterwards went to St. Jean d'Acre, with the object\r\nof settling with the pacha a treaty of commerce, and found him\r\npacifically inclined. In November he set out on his return to France,\r\nhaving accomplished all the objects of his mission. He was, after his\r\narrival, employed on various services, and, among the rest in a\r\ndiplomatic mission to Germany. He distinguished himself in the\r\ncampaign of 1804, was wounded at the battle of Austerlitz, and\r\nobtained the rank of general of division. Napoleon entertained a high\r\nopinion of his diplomatic talents, and named him, in 1806, ambassador\r\nto the Ottoman Porte--a mission which he filled for some years, with\r\nmuch ability. He established at Constantinople a printing-office for\r\nthe Turkish and Arabic languages, and by this means contributed not a\r\nlittle to the French influence in that country. The English having\r\nforced the passage of the Dardanelles, and menaced Constantinople,\r\nSebastiani immediately organized a plan of defence, marked out the\r\nbatteries, and prepared for the most vigorous resistance; but the\r\ninhabitants broke out into insurrection, and he was obliged to depart\r\nfor France. He was subsequently sent to Spain, where he distinguished\r\nhimself on numerous occasions; and he served in the Russian-German war\r\nunder Murat. July 15, 1812, he was surprised by the Russians at\r\nDrissa, but he recovered his character by his exertions at the battle\r\nof Borodino. On the invasion of France, he had a command in Champagne,\r\nand defended Chalons. April 10, M. Sebastiani sent to M. Talleyrand\r\nhis adhesion to the provisional government, and, June 1, received from\r\nthe king the cross of St. Louis. On the return of Napoleon, in 1815,\r\nhe was elected deputy of the lower chamber, and after the second\r\nabdication of Napoleon was one of the commissioners to treat for peace\r\nwith the allies. In 1819 he was elected a member of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, by the island of Corsica. His lucid and manly eloquence was\r\nemployed to throw light over all the great questions of finance, war,\r\nforeign politics, and domestic administration, and he evinced at once\r\nthe talents of an orator and the knowledge of a statesman. After the\r\nrevolution of 1830, General Sebastiani received the port-folio of the\r\nmarine in the Guizot ministry, and in November that of foreign affairs\r\nunder Laffitte, which he retained under Perier. He received the baton\r\nof Marshal from Louis Phillippe, and had retired from active political\r\nlife, when, in 1847, the assassination of his daughter, the Duchess de\r\nPraslin, by her husband, affected him so much that he never recovered\r\nfrom the blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies' Midsummer Fashions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are few changes to notice in the modes de Paris. Every thing at\r\nthis season is, of course, made in an airy style, and of very light\r\nmateriel. We copy two of the most graceful costumes in the recent\r\nbooks of patterns.\r\n\r\nI. _Morning Dress_ of white muslin, with flounces, ornamented with\r\nneedlework. Many dresses intended for neglige morning costume in the\r\ncountry consists of a skirt of checkered or striped silk, printed\r\nmuslin, or some other light material. For morning neglige a variety of\r\nvery pretty caps have appeared; they are of worked muslin, and are\r\ntrimmed with ribbon and fine Valenciennes.\r\n\r\nII. _Visiting Dress_ of glace or rich silk, with three flounces,\r\nembroidered. Mantelet of a splendid black lace, lined with pink silk,\r\nand richly trimmed with a deep fall of black lace, which also\r\nencircles the open sleeve. Bonnets of white _paille de riz_, decorated\r\nin the interior with red and white flounces.\r\n\r\n_Coiffures_ are extremely simple in form. A wreath of ivy leaves\r\nintermixed with small clusters of jewelry, and attached at the back\r\nwith a long lappet of gold lace, fastened by noeuds of pearls and\r\nemeralds, has a fine effect. Head-dresses of blonde are extremely\r\nbecoming, forming three points. These are fashionable for concerts,\r\n&c. They are placed backward on the head, the points at the side being\r\nattached with a profusion of flowers, the centre one falling over the\r\nback comb. Another style is of a lappet of white blonde, and another\r\nof plain pink tulle; the lappet of blonde being fastened just over the\r\nshoulder, and a little backward, with a bunch of grapes--the pink one,\r\nwhich is very wide, covering the bosom like a veil, and drooping as\r\nlow as the waist.\r\n\r\nFashionable colors are of all light mixtures, such as gray, lilac,\r\nfawn, mauve, green, and peach color--white, pink, and blue\r\npredominating for evening toilette.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES FENIMORE COOPER.\r\n\r\nFrom a Daguerreotype by Brady, taken for the International. 1851]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OTSEGO HALL.\r\n\r\nResidence of MR.
