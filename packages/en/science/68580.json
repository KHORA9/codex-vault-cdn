Warming’s _Haandbog i den\r\nSystematiske Botanik_ is taken from the text of the 3rd Danish\r\nEdition (1892), and from Dr. Knoblauch’s German Edition (1890), and\r\nthe book has been further enriched by numerous additional notes which\r\nhave been kindly sent to me by the author. Dr. Warming’s work has long\r\nbeen recognised as an original and important contribution to Systematic\r\nBotanical Literature, and I have only to regret that the pressure\r\nof other scientific duties has delayed its presentation to English\r\nreaders. Dr. Warming desires me to record his high appreciation of the\r\ncareful translation of Dr. Knoblauch, and his obligation to him for a\r\nnumber of corrections and improvements of which he has made use in the\r\n3rd Danish Edition. In a few instances I have made slight additions\r\nto the text; these, however, appear as footnotes, or are enclosed in\r\nsquare brackets.\r\n\r\nIn the present Edition the Thallophytes have been revised and\r\nrearranged from notes supplied to me by Dr. Knoblauch, to whom I am\r\nindebted for the Classification of the Fungi, according to the more\r\nrecent investigations of Brefeld. The Bacteria have been revised by\r\nDr. Migula, the Florideæ rearranged after Schmitz, and the Taphrinaceæ\r\nafter Sadebeck. The main body of the text of the Algæ and Fungi remains\r\nas it was originally written by Dr. Wille and Dr. Rostrup in the Danish\r\nEdition, though in many places considerable alterations and additions\r\nhave been made. For the sake of comparison a tabular key to the\r\nClassification adopted in the Danish Edition is given in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nIn the Angiosperms I have retained the sequence of orders in the Danish\r\noriginal, and have not rearranged them according to the systems\r\nmore familiar to English students. In any rearrangement much of the\r\nsignificance of Dr. Warming’s valuable and original observations\r\nwould have been lost, and also from a teacher’s point of view I have\r\nfound this system of great value. Although at present it may not be\r\ncompletely satisfactory, yet as an attempt to explain the mutual\r\nrelationships, development and retrogression of many of the orders, it\r\nmay be considered to have a distinct advantage over the more artificial\r\nsystems founded upon Jussieu’s Divisions of Polypetalæ, Gamopetalæ, and\r\nApetalæ.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the principles of the systematic arrangement adopted,\r\nI may here insert the following brief communication from the author\r\n(dated March, 1890), which he has requested me to quote from the\r\npreface of Dr. Knoblauch’s edition:--“Each form which, on comparative\r\nmorphological considerations, is clearly less simple, or can be shown\r\nto have arisen by reduction or through abortion of another type having\r\nthe same fundamental structure, or in which a further differentiation\r\nand division of labour is found, will be regarded as younger, and as\r\nfar as possible, and so far as other considerations will admit, will\r\nbe reviewed later than the ‘simpler,’ more complete, or richer forms.\r\nFor instance, to serve as an illustration: EPIGYNY and PERIGYNY are\r\nless simple than HYPOGNY; the Epigynous _Sympetalæ_, _Choripetalæ_,\r\n_Monocotyledones_ are, therefore, treated last, the _Hydrocharitaceæ_\r\nare considered last under the _Helobieæ_, etc. ZYGOMORPHY is younger\r\nthan ACTINOMORPHY; the _Scitamineæ_ and _Gynandræ_ therefore follow\r\nafter the _Liliifloræ_, the _Scrophulariaceæ_ after the _Solanaceæ_,\r\n_Linaria_ after _Verbascum_, etc. FORMS WITH UNITED LEAVES indicate\r\nyounger types than those with free leaves; hence the _Sympetalæ_\r\ncome after the _Choripetalæ_, the _Sileneæ_ after the _Alsineæ_, the\r\n_Malcaceæ_ after the _Sterculiaceæ_ and _Tiliaceæ_, etc.\r\n\r\n“ACYCLIC (spiral-leaved) flowers are older than cyclic\r\n(verticillate-leaved) with a definite number, comparing, of course,\r\nonly those with the same fundamental structure. The _Veronica_-type\r\nmust be considered as younger, for example, than _Digitalis_\r\nand _Antirrhinum_, these again as younger than _Scrophularia_;\r\n_Verbascum_, on the contrary, is the least reduced, and therefore\r\nconsidered as the oldest form. Similarly the one-seeded, nut-fruited\r\n_Ranunculaceæ_ are considered as a later type (with evident abortion)\r\nthan the many-seeded, folicular forms of the Order; the _Paronychieæ_\r\nand _Chenopodiaceæ_ as reduced forms of the _Alsineæ_ type; and the\r\noccurrence of few seeds in an ovary as generally arising through\r\nreduction of the many-seeded forms. The _Cyperaceæ_ are regarded as\r\na form derived from the _Juncaceæ_ through reduction, and associated\r\nwith this, as is so often the case, there is a complication of the\r\ninflorescence; the _Dipsacaceæ_ are again regarded as a form proceeding\r\nfrom the _Valerianaceæ_ by a similar reduction, and these in their\r\nturn as an offshoot from the _Caprifoliaceæ_, etc. Of course these\r\nprinciples of systematic arrangement could only be applied very\r\ngenerally; for teaching purposes they have often required modification.”\r\n\r\nIn preparing the translation considerable difficulty has been\r\nexperienced in finding a satisfactory rendering of several terms which\r\nhave no exact equivalent in English. I may here especially mention the\r\nterm Vorblatt (Forblad) which I have translated by the term bracteole,\r\nwhen it clearly applied to the first leaf (or leaves) on a pedicel; but\r\nin discussing questions of general morphology a term was much needed\r\nto include both vegetative and floral shoots, and for this I have\r\nemployed the term “Fore-leaf.” Also, the term “Floral-leaf” has been\r\nadopted as an equivalent of “Hochblatt,” and the term “bract” has been\r\nlimited to a leaf subtending a flower. I have followed Dr. E. L. Mark\r\nin translating the word “Anlage” by “Fundament.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of the book will be found a short appendix giving an outline\r\nof some of the earlier systems of Classification, with a more complete\r\naccount of that of Hooker and Bentham.\r\n\r\nIn a book of this character it is almost impossible to avoid some\r\nerrors, but it is hoped that these will be comparatively few. In\r\ncorrecting the proof-sheets I have received invaluable assistance\r\nfrom Dr. Warming and Dr. Knoblauch, who have kindly read through\r\nevery sheet, and to whom I am greatly indebted for many criticisms\r\nand suggestions. I have also to thank Mr. I. H. Burkill for his kind\r\nassistance in looking over the proofs of the Monocotyledons and\r\nDicotyledons, and Mr. Harold Wager for kindly reading through the\r\nproofs of the Algæ and Fungi. My thanks are also especially due to Mr.\r\nE. L. Danielsen, and I wish to take this opportunity of acknowledging\r\nthe very considerable help which I have received from him in\r\ntranslating from the Original Danish.\r\n                                                     M.

Phar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               CLASSIFICATION OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vegetable Kingdom is arranged in 5 Divisions.\r\n\r\nDivision I.--=Thallophyta=, =Stemless Plants=, or those which\r\nare composed of a “thallus,” _i.e._ organs of nourishment which\r\nare not differentiated into root (in the sense in which this term is\r\nused among the higher plants), stem, or leaf. Vascular bundles are\r\nwanting. Conjugation and fertilisation in various ways; among most of\r\nthe Fungi only vegetative multiplication.\r\n\r\n   In contradistinction to the Thallophytes all other plants are\r\n   called “Stem-plants” (“Cormophyta”), because their shoots are\r\n   leaf-bearing stems. The name Thallophyta (Stemless-plants) is\r\n   to some extent unsuitable, since many of the higher Algæ are\r\n   differentiated into stem and leaf.\r\n\r\nThe Thallophytes are again separated into 3 sub-divisions, namely:\r\n\r\n    Sub-Division =A.=--=Myxomycetes, Slime-Fungi=, with only 1 class.\r\n\r\n    Sub-Division =B.=--=Algæ=, with 10 classes:\r\n        Class 1. Syngeneticæ.\r\n          „   2. Dinoflagellata, Peridinea.\r\n          „   3. Diatomeæ, Diatoms.\r\n          „   4. Schizophyta, Fission Algæ.\r\n          „   5. Conjugatæ.\r\n          „   6. Chlorophyceæ, Green Algæ.\r\n          „   7. Characeæ, Stone-worts.\r\n          „   8. Phæophyceæ, Brown Algæ.\r\n          „   9. Dictyotales.\r\n          „  10. Rhodophyceæ, Red Algæ.\r\n\r\n    Sub-Division =C.=--=Fungi=, with 3 classes:\r\n        Class 1. Phycomycetes.\r\n          „   2. Mesomycetes.\r\n          „   3. Mycomycetes, Higher Fungi.\r\n\r\nDivision II.--=Bryophyta or Muscineæ, Mosses.= These have\r\nleaf-bearing shoots, but neither true roots nor vascular bundles. The\r\nlowest Mosses have, however, a thallus. Fertilisation is accomplished\r\nby means of self-motile, spirally coiled spermatozoids, through the\r\nagency of water. From the fertilised oosphere a “fruit-body” (capsule)\r\nwith unicellular organs of reproduction (spores) is produced. The spore\r\non germination gives rise to the vegetative system, which bears the\r\norgans of sexual reproduction; and this system is divided into two\r\nstages--the protonema, and the leaf-bearing plant produced on it.\r\n\r\nAlternation of generations:\r\n\r\n     I. The protonema and the entire nutritive system which\r\n          bears the organs of sexual reproduction.\r\n    II. The capsule-like sporangium, with spores.\r\n     2 Classes: 1. Hepaticæ, Liverworts.\r\n                2. Musci, Leafy Mosses.\r\n\r\nDivision III.--=Pteridophyta or Vascular Cryptogams=, =Fern-like\r\nPlants= having leaf-bearing shoots, true roots, and vascular bundles\r\nwith tracheides and sieve-tubes. Fertilisation as in the Mosses. From\r\nthe fertilised oosphere the leaf-bearing shoot arises, which bears\r\non its leaves the reproductive organs, the spores, in capsule-like\r\nsporangia. From the germination of the spore a small prothallium is\r\nformed, which bears the sexual reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nAlternation of generations:\r\n\r\n     I. Prothallium with organs of sexual reproduction.\r\n    II. Leaf-bearing shoot with capsule-like sporangia.\r\n     3 Classes: 1. Filicinæ, True Ferns.\r\n                2. Equisetinæ, Horsetails.\r\n                3. Lycopodinæ, Club-mosses.\r\n\r\nDivision IV.--=Gymnospermæ.= The vegetative organs are in the\r\nmain similar to those in the 3rd Division; special shoots are modified\r\ninto flowers for the service of reproduction. From the oosphere, which\r\nis fertilised by means of the pollen-tube, the leaf-bearing plant is\r\nderived; this passes the first period of its life as an embryo in\r\nthe seed, and continues its development when the germination of the\r\nseed takes place. The organs corresponding to the spores of the two\r\npreceding Divisions, are called respectively the pollen-grain and\r\nembryo-sac. The pollen-grains are multicellular; i.e. they contain\r\nan indistinct prothallium. In the embryo-sac a prothallium, rich in\r\nreserve material (endosperm), with female organs of reproduction, is\r\ndeveloped BEFORE FERTILISATION. The pollen-grains are carried\r\nby means of the wind to the ovules; these enclose the embryo-sac, and\r\nare situated on the open fruit-leaf (carpel), which has no stigma.\r\n\r\nAlternation of generations:\r\n\r\n     I. Prothallium = Endosperm in ovule.\r\n    II. Leaf-bearing plant, with flowers which produce the pollen-sac\r\n          and ovule.\r\n     3 Classes: 1. Cycadeæ.\r\n                2. Coniferæ.\r\n                3. Gnetaceæ.\r\n\r\nDivision V.--=Angiospermæ=. The members of this group are very\r\nsimilar to those of Division IV. The ovules are, however, encased in\r\nclosed fruit-leaves (ovary), which have a special portion (stigma)\r\nadapted for the reception and germination of the pollen-grains. The\r\npollen-grains are bicellular, but with only a membrane separating\r\nthe two nuclei; they are carried to the stigma by animals (chiefly\r\ninsects), by the wind, or by some other means. Endosperm is not formed\r\ntill AFTER FERTILISATION. Alternation of generations in the main as in\r\nthe Gymnosperms, but less distinct; while the sexual generation, the\r\nprothallium, with the organs of fertilisation, is also strongly reduced.\r\n\r\n    2 Classes:[1] 1. Monocotyledones. Embryo with one seed-leaf.\r\n                  2. Dicotyledones. Embryo with two seed-leaves.\r\n\r\n   For a long time the vegetable kingdom has been divided\r\n   into. CRYPTOGAMS (so called because their organs\r\n   of reproduction remained for some time undiscovered), and\r\n   PHANEROGAMS or Flowering-plants which have evident\r\n   sexual organs.\r\n\r\n   The first three divisions belong to the Cryptogams, and the\r\n   third and fourth divisions to the Phanerogams. This arrangement\r\n   has no systematic value, but is very convenient in many ways.\r\n\r\n   The Cryptogams are also known as Spore-plants, since they\r\n   multiply by unicellular organs (spores), and the Phanerogams in\r\n   contradistinction are called Seed-plants (Spermaphyta), since\r\n   they multiply by seeds, multicellular bodies, the most important\r\n   part of which is the embryo (a plant in its infancy). Mosses,\r\n   Ferns, and Gymnosperms are together known as Archegoniatæ, since\r\n   they possess in common a female organ of distinct structure, the\r\n   Archegonium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DIVISION I.\r\n\r\n                             THALLOPHYTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thallus in the simplest forms is unicellular; in the majority,\r\nhowever, it is built up of many cells, which in a few instances are\r\nexactly similar; but generally there is a division of labour, so\r\nthat certain cells undertake certain functions and are constructed\r\naccordingly, while others have different work and corresponding\r\nstructure. Vessels or similar high anatomical structures are seldom\r\nformed, and the markings on the cell-wall are with few exceptions very\r\nsimple. The Myxomycetes occupy quite an isolated position; their organs\r\nof nourishment are naked masses of protoplasm (plasmodia).\r\n\r\nAs regards the external form, the thallus may be entirely without\r\nspecial prominences (such as branches, members), but when such are\r\npresent they are all essentially alike in their origin and growth,\r\nthat is, disregarding the hair-structures which may be developed. A\r\nshoot of a Seaweed or of a Lichen, etc., is essentially the same as\r\nany other part of the plant; only among the highest Algæ (Characeæ,\r\ncertain Siphoneæ, _Sargassum_, and certain Red Seaweeds) do we find the\r\nsame differences between the various external organs of the plant body\r\nas between stem and leaf, so that they must be distinguished by these\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n_Roots_ of the same structure and development as in the Seed-plants\r\nare not found, but _organs of attachment_ (rhizoids and haptera) serve\r\npartly the biological functions of the root.\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC DIVISION OF THE THALLOPHYTES. To the Thallophytes belong\r\nthree sub-divisions--Slime-Fungi, Algæ, and Fungi. Formerly the\r\nThallophytes were divided into Algæ, Fungi, and Lichens. But this\r\nlast group must be placed among the Fungi, since they are really\r\nFungi, which live symbiotically with Algæ. The _Slime-Fungi_ must be\r\nseparated from the true Fungi as a distinct subdivision. The _Algæ_\r\npossess a colouring substance, which is generally green, brown, or\r\nred, and by means of which they are able to build up organic compounds\r\nfrom carbonic acid and water. The Bacteria, especially, form an\r\nexception to the Algæ in this respect; like the Fungi and Slime-Fungi\r\nthey have as a rule no such colouring material, but must have organic\r\ncarbonaceous food; these plants form no starch, and need no light for\r\ntheir vegetation (most Fungi require light for fructification). The\r\nMyxomycetes, Bacteria, and Fungi derive their nourishment either as\r\n_saprophytes_ from dead animal or vegetable matter, or as _parasites_\r\nfrom living animals or plants (hosts), in which they very often cause\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n   A remark, however, must be made with regard to this division.\r\n   Among the higher plants so much stress is not laid upon the\r\n   biological relations as to divide them into “green” and\r\n   “non-green”; _Cuscuta_ (Dodder), a parasite, is placed among\r\n   the Convolvulaceæ, _Neottia_ and _Corallorhiza_, saprophytes,\r\n   belong to the Orchidacere, although they live like Fungi,\r\n   yet their relations live as Algæ. In the same manner there\r\n   are some colourless parasitic or saprophytic forms among the\r\n   Algæ, and stress must be laid upon the fact that not only the\r\n   Blue-green Algæ, but also the Bacteria, which cannot assimilate\r\n   carbonic-acid, belong to the Algæ group, Schizophyceæ. The\r\n   reason for this is that systematic classifications must be based\r\n   upon the relationship of form, development, and reproduction,\r\n   and from this point of view we must regard the Bacteria as\r\n   being the nearer relatives of the Blue-green Algæ. All the\r\n   Thallophytes, which are designated Fungi (when the entire\r\n   group of Slime-Fungi is left out), form in some measure a\r\n   connected series of development which only in the lower forms\r\n   (Phycomycetes) is related to the Algæ, and probably through them\r\n   has taken its origin from the Algæ; the higher Fungi have then\r\n   developed independently from this beginning. The distinction\r\n   of colour referred to is therefore not the only one which\r\n   separates the Algæ from the Fungi, but it is almost the only\r\n   characteristic mark by which we can at once distinguish the two\r\n   great sub-divisions of the Thallophytes.\r\n\r\n   The first forms of life on earth were probably “Protistæ,”\r\n   which had assimilating colour material, or in other words, they\r\n   were Algæ because they could assimilate purely inorganic food\r\n   substances, and there are some among these which belong to the\r\n   simplest forms of all plants. Fungi and Slime-Fungi must have\r\n   appeared later, because they are dependent on other plants which\r\n   assimilate carbon.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Sub-Division I._--=MYXOMYCETES, SLIME-FUNGI.=\r\n\r\nThe Slime-Fungi occupy quite an isolated position in the Vegetable\r\nKingdom, and are perhaps the most nearly related to the group of\r\nRhizopods in the Animal Kingdom. They live in and on organic remains,\r\nespecially rotten wood or leaves, etc., on the surface of which their\r\nsporangia may be found.\r\n\r\nThey are organisms without chlorophyll, and in their vegetative\r\ncondition are masses of protoplasm without cell-wall (_plasmodia_).\r\nThey multiply by means of _spores_, which in the true Slime-Fungi[3]\r\nare produced in sporangia, but in some others[4] free. The spores\r\nare round cells (Fig. 1 _a_) which in all the true Slime-Fungi are\r\nsurrounded by a cell-wall. The wall bursts on germination, and the\r\ncontents float out in the water which is necessary for germination.\r\nThey move about with swimming and hopping motions like swarmspores\r\n(_e_, _f_), having a cilia at the front end and provided with a\r\ncell-nucleus and a pulsating vacuole. Later on they become a little\r\nless active, and creep about more slowly, while they continue to alter\r\ntheir form, shooting out arms in various places and drawing them in\r\nagain (_g_, _h_, _i_, _k_, _l_, _m_); in this stage they are called\r\n_Myxamœbæ_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--_a-l_ Development of “_Fuligo_” from\r\n  spore to Myxamœba; _a-m_ are magnified 300 times; _m_ is a\r\n  Myxamœba of _Lycogala epidendron_; _l´_ three Myxamœbæ of\r\n  _Physarum album_ about to unite; _o_, a small portion of\r\n  plasmodium, magnified 90 times.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--The plasmodium (_a_) of _Stemonitis\r\n  fusca_, commencing to form into sporangia (_b_); drawn on July\r\n  9. The dark-brown sporangia were completely formed by the next\r\n  morning; _c-e_ shows the development of their external form.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Four sporangia of _Stemonitis fusca_,\r\n  fixed on a branch. _a_ The plasmodium.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Sporangium of _Arcyria incarnata_. _B_\r\n  closed; _C_ open; _p_ wall of sporangium; _cp_ capilitium.]\r\n\r\nThe Myxamœba grows whilst taking up nourishment from the material in\r\nwhich it lives, and multiplies by division. At a later stage a larger\r\nor smaller number of Myxamœbæ may be seen to coalesce and form large\r\nmasses of protoplasm, _plasmodia_, which in the “Flowers of Tan” may\r\nattain the size of the palm of a hand, or even larger, but in most\r\nothers are smaller. The plasmodia are independent, cream-like masses of\r\nprotoplasm, often containing grains of carbonate of lime and colouring\r\nmatter (the latter yellow in the Flowers of Tan). They creep about in\r\nthe decaying matter in which they live, by means of amœboid movements,\r\ninternal streamings of the protoplasm continually taking place; finally\r\nthey creep out to the surface, and very often attach themselves to\r\nother objects, such as Mosses, and form sporangia (Fig. 2). These are\r\nstalked or sessile and are generally cylindrical (Fig. 3), spherical\r\nor pear-shaped (Fig. 4); they rarely attain a larger size than that of\r\na pin’s head, and are red, brown, white, blue, yellow, etc., with a\r\nvery delicate wall. In some genera may be found a “Capillitium” (Fig. 4\r\n_cp_), or network of branched fine strands between the spores. Flowers\r\nof Tan (_Fuligo septica_) has a fruit-body composed of many sporangia\r\n(an Æthalium), which has the appearance of flat, irregular, brown\r\ncakes, inside the fragile external layer of which a loose powder, the\r\nspores, is found. It generally occurs on heaps of tanners’ bark, and\r\nappears sometimes in hot-beds in which that material is used, and is\r\ndestructive by spreading itself over the young plants and choking them.\r\n\r\nAll the motile stages may pass into _resting stages_, the small forms\r\nonly surrounding themselves with a wall, but the large ones at the\r\nsame time divide in addition into polyhedral cells. When favourable\r\nconditions arise, the walls dissolve and the whole appears again as a\r\nnaked (free-moving) mass of protoplasm.\r\n\r\nTo the genuine Slime-Fungi belong: _Arcyria_, _Trichia_, _Didymium_,\r\n_Physarum_, _Stemonitis_, _Lycogala_, _Fuligo_, _Spumaria_,\r\n_Reticularia_.\r\n\r\nSome genera wanting a sporangium-wall belong to the Slime-Fungi:\r\n_Ceratiomyxa_, whose fruit-body consists of polygonal plates, each\r\nbearing stalked spores; _Dictyostelium_, in which the swarm-stage is\r\nwanting and which has stalked spores. _Plasmodiophora brassicæ_ preys\r\nupon the roots of cabbages and other cruciferous plants, causing large\r\nswellings. _Pl. alni_ causes coral-shaped outgrowths on the roots of\r\nthe Alder (_Alnus_). _Phytomyxa leguminosarum_ may be found in small\r\nknobs (tubercles) on the roots of leguminous plants. It is still\r\nuncertain whether it is this Fungus or Bacteria which is the cause of\r\nthe formation of these tubercles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Sub-Division_ II.--=ALGÆ=.\r\n\r\n=Mode of Life.= The Algæ (except most of the Bacteria) are themselves\r\nable to form their organic material by the splitting up of the carbonic\r\nacid contained in the water, or air in some cases, and for this purpose\r\nneed light. The majority live in water, fresh or salt, but many are\r\npresent on damp soil, stones, bark of trees, etc.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Bacteria, no saprophytes have actually been\r\ndetermined to belong to this group, and only very few true parasites\r\n(for instance, _Phyllosiphon arisari_, _Mycoidea_, etc.), but a\r\ngood many are found epiphytic or endophytic on other Algæ, or water\r\nplants, and on animals (for instance, certain _Schizophyceæ_ and\r\n_Protococcoideæ_; _Trichophilus welckeri_ in the hairs of _Bradypus_,\r\nthe Sloth), and several species in symbiotic relation to various Fungi\r\n(species of Lichen), to Sponges (_e.g. Trentepohlia spongiophila_,\r\n_Struvea delicatula_), and to sundry Infusoria and other lower\r\nanimals as Radiolarias, _Hydra_, etc. (the so-called _Zoochlorella_\r\nand _Zooxantella_, which are perhaps partly stages in development of\r\nvarious Green and Brown Algæ).\r\n\r\n=Vegetative Organs.= The cells in all the Algæ (excepting certain\r\nreproductive cells) are surrounded by a membrane which (with the\r\nexception of the Bacteria) consists of pure or altered cellulose,\r\nsometimes forming a gelatinous covering, at other times a harder one,\r\nwith deposits of chalk or silica formed in it. The cell-nucleus,\r\nwhich in the Schizophyta is less differentiated, may be one or more\r\n(_e.g. Hydrodictyon_, _Siphoneæ_) in each cell. Excepting in the\r\nmajority of the Bacteria, _colour materials_ (of which _chlorophyll_,\r\nor modifications of it, always seems to be found) occur, which either\r\npermeate the whole cytoplasm surrounding the cell-nucleus, as in most\r\nof the coloured Schizophyta, or are contained in certain specially\r\nformed small portions of protoplasm (chromatophores).\r\n\r\nThe individual at a certain stage of development consists nearly always\r\nof only one cell; by its division multicellular individuals may arise,\r\nor, if the daughter-cells separate immediately after the division, as\r\nin many of the simplest forms, the individual will, during the whole\r\ncourse of its existence, consist of only a single cell (unicellular\r\nAlgæ). In multicellular individuals the cells may be more or less\r\nfirmly connected, and all the cells of the individual may be exactly\r\nalike, or a division of labour may take place, so that certain cells\r\nundertake certain functions, and are constructed accordingly; this\r\nmay also occur in parts of the cell in the large unicellular and\r\nmultinuclear Algæ (Siphoneæ, p. 62).\r\n\r\nThe cells in most of the Algæ belong to the _parenchymatous_ form;\r\nthese, however, in the course of their growth, may very often become\r\nsomewhat oblong; in many Algæ (particularly Fucoideæ and Florideæ)\r\noccur, moreover, _hyphæ-like threads_, which are very long, often\r\nbranched, and are either formed of a single cell, or, more frequently,\r\nof a row of cells, having a well-pronounced apical growth. The\r\nparenchymatous as well as the hyphæ-like cells may, in the higher\r\nAlgæ (especially in certain Fucoideæ and Florideæ), be further\r\ndifferentiated, so that they form well-defined anatomico-physiological\r\nsystems of tissue, _i.e._ assimilating, conducting, storing, and\r\nmechanical.\r\n\r\nWith regard to _the external form_, the thallus may present no\r\ndifferentiation, as in many unicellular Algæ, or in multicellular Algæ\r\nof the lower order, which are then either equally developed in all\r\ndirections (_e.g. Pleurococcus_, Fig. 47), or form flat cell-plates\r\n(_Merismopedium_) or threads (_Oscillaria_, Fig. 21). The first step\r\nin the way of differentiation appears as a difference between apex and\r\nbase (_Rivularia_, _Porphyra_); but the division of labour may proceed\r\nso that differences may arise between vegetative and reproductive cells\r\n(_Œdogonium_, Fig. 54); hairs and organs of attachment (rhizoids and\r\nhaptera), which biologically serve as roots, are developed, and even\r\nleaves in certain forms of high order, belonging to different classes\r\n(_e.g. Caulerpa_, Fig. 59; _Characeæ_, Fig. 61; _Sargassum_, Fig. 72;\r\nand many Florideæ).\r\n\r\n=The non-sexual reproduction= takes place _vegetatively_, in many\r\ninstances, simply by division into two, and more or less complete\r\nseparation of the divisional products (Diatomaceæ, Desmidiaceæ (Fig.\r\n36), many Fission-plants, etc.), or by detached portions of the thallus\r\n(_e.g. Caulerpa_, _Ulva lactuca_, etc.; among many Schizophyceæ,\r\nsmall filaments known as _hormogonia_ are set free), or _asexually_ by\r\nspecial reproductive cells (_spores_) set free from the thallus; these\r\nmay be either _stationary_ or _motile_. The stationary reproductive\r\ncells (spores) may either be devoid of cell-wall (tetraspores of the\r\nFlorideæ), or may possess a cell-wall; in the latter case they may be\r\nformed directly from the vegetative cells, generally by the thickening\r\nof the walls (_akinetes_), or only after a process of re-juvenescence\r\n(_aplanospores_). Aplanospores, as well as akinetes, may either\r\ngerminate immediately or may become resting-cells, which germinate only\r\nafter a period of rest.\r\n\r\nTHE MOTILE ASEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE CELLS are spherical, egg- or\r\npear-shaped, naked, _swarmspores_ (_zoospores_), which have arisen\r\nin other cells (_zoosporangia_), and propel themselves through the\r\nwater by means of cilia; or they are _Phyto-Amœbæ_, which have no\r\ncilia and creep on a substratum by means of pseudopodia. The cilia,\r\nwhich are formed from the protoplasm (in the Bacteria, however, from\r\nthe membrane), are mostly situated at the pointed and colourless end,\r\nwhich is directed forwards when in motion, and are 1, 2 (Fig. 5 _B_),\r\n4 or more. Both the cilia in the Brown Algæ are attached to one side\r\n(Fig. 65); they are occasionally situated in a circle round the front\r\nend (_Œdogonium_, Fig. 6 _a_, and _Derbesia_), or are very numerous\r\nand situated in pairs distributed over a large part or nearly the\r\nwhole of the zoospore (_Vaucheria_). Besides being provided with one\r\nor more nuclei (_Vaucheria_), they may also have a red “eye spot”\r\nand vacuoles, which are sometimes pulsating, _i.e._ they appear and\r\nreappear at certain intervals. The swarmspores move about in the\r\nwater in irregular paths, and apparently quite voluntarily, revolving\r\nround their longer axes; but they come to the surface of the water in\r\ngreat numbers either because of their dependence on light, or driven\r\nby warm currents in the water, or attracted by some passing mass of\r\nfood material. The swarmspores germinate, each forming a new plant,\r\nas their movement ceases they surround themselves with a cell-wall,\r\ngrow, and then divide; in Fig. 6 _b_, two may be seen in the condition\r\nof germination, and about to attach themselves by means of the front\r\nend, which has been developed into haptera (see also Fig. 5 _B_, lowest\r\nfigure).\r\n\r\n=The sexual reproduction= here, probably in all cases, consists in the\r\ncoalescence of two masses of protoplasm, that is, in the fusion of\r\ntheir nuclei.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Cladophora glomerata. A_ The lower\r\n  cells are full of swarmspores, whilst from the upper one the\r\n  greater part have escaped through the aperture _m_. _B_ Free and\r\n  germinating swarmspores.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--_Œdogonium_: _a_ (free), _b_ germinating\r\n  swarmspores.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--_Zanardinia collaris. A_ Male\r\n  gametangia (the small-celled) and female gametangia\r\n  (large-celled). _C_ Female gamete. _D_ Male gamete. _B E_\r\n  Fertilisation. _F_ Zygote. _G_ Germinating zygote.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest and lowest form is termed =conjugation=, or =isogamous=\r\nfertilisation, and is characterized by the fact that the two coalescing\r\ncells (termed gametes) are equal, or almost equal, in shape and size\r\n(the female gamete in the _Cutleriaceæ_, _e.g. Zanardinia collaris_,\r\nFig. 7, is considerably larger than the male gamete). The cell in\r\nwhich the _gametes_ are developed is called a _gametaugium_, and the\r\nreproductive cell formed by their union--which generally has a thick\r\nwall and only germinates after a short period of rest--is termed a\r\n_zygote_ or _zygospore_. The conjugation takes place in two ways:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) In the one way the gametes are motile cells (_planogametes_,\r\n_zoogametes_, Fig. 8), which unite in pairs during their swarming\r\nhither and thither in the water; during this process they lie side by\r\nside (Fig. 8 _d_), generally at first touching at the clear anterior\r\nend, and after a time they coalesce and become a motionless _zygote_,\r\nwhich surrounds itself with a cell-wall (Fig. 8 _e_). This form of\r\nconjugation is found in _Ulothrix_ (Fig. 8 _d_), _Acetabularia_, and\r\nother Algæ (Figs. 45, 56, 66).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--_Ulothrix zonata_: a portion of\r\n  a thread with zoospores, of which two are formed in each\r\n  cell (zoosporangium), the dark spots upon them are the “red\r\n  eye-spots”; 1, 2, 3, 4 depict successive stages in the\r\n  development of the zoospores; _b_ a single zoospore, at _v_ the\r\n  pulsating vacuole; _c_ portion of a thread with gametes, of which\r\n  sixteen are formed in each gametangium; _d_ gametes free and in\r\n  conjugation; _e_ conjugation has been effected, and the formed\r\n  zygotes are in the resting condition.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Among other Algæ (_e.g. Diatomaceæ_ and _Conjugatæ_), the\r\nconjugating cells continue to be surrounded by the cell-wall of\r\nthe mother-cell (_aplanogametes_ in an _aplanogametangium_); the\r\naplanogametangia generally grow out into short branches, which lie\r\nclose together and touch one another, the wall at the point of contact\r\nis then dissolved (Fig. 39). Through the aperture thus formed, the\r\naplanogametes unite, as in the first instance, and form a rounded\r\nzygote, which immediately surrounds itself with a cell-wall. Various\r\nmodifications occur; compare Figs. 37, 39, 41, 43.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Fertilisation in the Bladder-wrack\r\n  (_Fucus vesiculosus_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Sphæroplea annulina._]\r\n\r\nThe highest form of the sexual reproduction is the =Egg- or Oogamous=\r\nfertilisation. The two coalescing cells are in the main unlike each\r\nother in form as well as size. The one which is considered as the male,\r\nand is known as the _spermatozoid_ (_antherozoid_), developes as a rule\r\nin large numbers in each mother-cell (_antheridium_); they are often\r\nself-motile (except in the Florideæ, where they are named _spermatia_),\r\nand are many times smaller than the other kind, the female, which\r\nis known as the _egg-cell_, (_oosphere_). The egg-cell is always a\r\nmotionless, spherical, primordial cell which can either float about\r\nfreely in the water, as in the Fucaceæ (Fig. 9), or is surrounded by\r\na cell-wall (_oogonium_); generally only one oosphere is to be found\r\nin each oogonium, but several occur in _Sphæroplea_ (Fig. 10). The\r\nresult of the spermatozoid coalescing with the egg-cell is, as in this\r\ncase, the formation of a oospore, which generally undergoes a period of\r\nrest before germination (the Florideæ are an exception, a fruit-body,\r\n_cystocarp_, being produced as the result of coalescence).\r\n\r\n   An example of fertilisation is afforded by the Alga, _Sphæroplea\r\n   annulina_ (Fig. 10). The filamentous thallus is formed of\r\n   cylindrical cells with many vacuoles (_r_ in _A_); some cells\r\n   develope egg-cells (_B_), others spermatozoids (_C_), the latter\r\n   in a particularly large number. The egg-cells are spherical,\r\n   the spermatozoids of a club- or elongated pear-shape with two\r\n   cilia at the front end (_G_; _E_ is however a swarmspore).\r\n   The spermatozoids escape from their cells through apertures\r\n   in the wall (_o_ in _C_) and enter through similar apertures\r\n   (_o_ in _B_) to the egg-cells. The colourless front end of the\r\n   spermatozoid is united at first with the “receptive spot” of the\r\n   egg-cell (see _F_), and afterwards completely coalesces with\r\n   it. The result is the formation of a oospore with wart-like\r\n   excrescences (_D_).\r\n\r\nThe female (_parthenogenesis_) or male (_androgenesis_) sexual cell\r\nmay, sometimes without any preceding fertilisation, form a new\r\nindividual (_e.g. Ulothrix zonata_, _Cylindrocapsa_, etc.).\r\n\r\n=Systematic division of the Algæ.= The Algæ are divided into the\r\nfollowing ten classes:\r\n\r\n   1. SYNGENETICÆ; 2. DINOFLAGELLATA, or PERIDINEA; 3. DIATOMACEÆ;\r\n   4. SCHIZOPHYTA, FISSION-ALGÆ; 5. CONJUGATÆ; 6. CHLOROPHYCEÆ,\r\n   GREEN-ALGÆ; 7. CHARACEÆ, STONE-WORTS; 8. PHÆOPHYCEÆ; 9.\r\n   DICTYOTALES; 10. RHODOPHYCEÆ.\r\n\r\nAmong the lowest forms of the Algæ, the Syngeneticæ, the\r\nDinoflagellata, and the unicellular Volvocaceæ (Chlamydomoneæ),\r\ndistinct transitional forms are found approaching the animal kingdom,\r\nwhich can be grouped as animals or plants according to their method of\r\ntaking food or other characteristics. Only an artificial boundary can\r\ntherefore be drawn between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In the\r\nfollowing pages only those forms which possess _chromatophores_,\r\nand have _no mouth_, will be considered as Algæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Class 1. =Syngeneticæ.=\r\n\r\nThe individuals are uni- or multicellular, free-swimming or motionless.\r\nThe cells (which in the multicellular forms are loosely connected\r\ntogether, often only by mucilaginous envelopes) are naked or surrounded\r\nby a mucilaginous cell-wall, in which silica is never embedded. They\r\ncontain one cell-nucleus, one or more pulsating vacuoles, and one to\r\ntwo band- or plate-like chromatophores with a brown or yellow colour,\r\nand sometimes a pyrenoid.\r\n\r\nReproduction takes place by vegetative division, or asexually by\r\nzoospores, akinetes (or aplanospores?). Sexual reproduction is unknown.\r\nThey are all fresh water forms.\r\n\r\n   To this class may perhaps be assigned the recently arranged and\r\n   very little known orders of _Calcocytaceæ_, _Murracytaceæ_,\r\n   _Xanthellaceæ_, and _Dictyochaceæ_, which partly occur in the\r\n   free condition in the sea, in the so-called “Plankton,” and\r\n   partly symbiotic in various lower marine animals.\r\n\r\nThe _Syngeneticæ_ are closely related to certain forms in the\r\nanimal kingdom, as the Flagellatæ.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Chrysomonadinaceæ.= Individuals, uni- or multicellular,\r\nswimming in free condition, naked or surrounded by a mucilaginous\r\ncovering. The cells are generally oval or elongated, with 2 (rarely\r\nonly 1) cilia, almost of the same length, and generally with a red\r\n“eye-spot” at their base, and with 2 (rarely 1 only) band-shaped\r\nchromatophores. Reproduction by the longitudinal division of the\r\nindividual cells either during the swarming, or during a resting stage;\r\nin the multicellular forms also by the liberation of one or more cells,\r\nwhich in the latter case are connected together.\r\n\r\n   A. Unicellular: _Chromulina_, _Cryptoglena_, _Microglena_,\r\n   _Nephroselmis_.\r\n\r\n   B. Multicellular: _Uroglena_, _Syncrypta_ (Fig. 11), _Synura_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Syncrypta volvox_: the multicellular\r\n  individual is surrounded by a mucilaginous granular envelope.]\r\n\r\n   Among the unicellular Chrysomonadinaceæ are probably classed\r\n   some forms which are only stages in the development of the\r\n   multicellular, or of other _Syngeneticæ_.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Chrysopyxaceæ= are unicellular, and differ mainly\r\nfrom the preceding in being attached either on a slime-thread\r\n(_Stylochrysalis_), or enclosed in an envelope (_Chrysopyxis_,\r\nFig. 12). They have two cilia, and multiply by longitudinal\r\n(_Chrysopyxis_) or transverse division, and the swarming of one of the\r\ndaughter-individuals (zoospore). Division may also take place in a\r\nmotionless stage (_palmella-stage_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Chrsopyxis bipes_: _m_ envelope, _Ec_\r\n  chromatophore, _cv_ contractile vacuole.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Dinobryinaceæ.= The individuals are originally attached,\r\nuni- or multicellular; each individual cell is distinctly contractile,\r\nand fixed at the bottom of a cup-shaped, open envelope. Cilia 2, but\r\nof unequal length. Asexual reproduction by zoospores, which are formed\r\nby straight or oblique longitudinal division of the mother-cell,\r\nduring a palmella-stage which is produced in the winter aplanospores.\r\n_Epipyxis_, _Dinobryon_.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Hydruraceæ.= The individuals are attached, without cilia,\r\nmulticellular, branched, and with apical growth. The cells are\r\nspherical, but in the final stage almost spindle-shaped, and embedded\r\nin large masses of mucilage. Asexual reproduction by zoospores which\r\nare tetrahedric, with 1 cilia, and by resting akinetes. _Hydrurus_ is\r\nmost common in mountain brooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Class 2. =Dinoflagellata.=\r\n\r\nThe individuals are of a very variable form, but always unicellular,\r\nand floating about in free condition. The cell is _dorsiventral_,\r\n_bilateral_, _asymmetric_ and generally surrounded by a colourless\r\nmembrane, which has _no silica_ embedded in it, but is formed of\r\na substance allied to _cellulose_. The membrane, which externally\r\nis provided with pores and raised borders, easily breaks up into\r\nirregularly-shaped pieces. In the forms which have longitudinal and\r\ncross furrows, _two cilia_ are fixed where these cross each other, and\r\nproject through a cleft in the membrane; one of these cilia _projects\r\nfreely_ and is directed longitudinally to the front or to the rear,\r\nthe other one _stretches crosswise_ and lies close to the cell, often\r\nin a furrow (cross furrow). The chromatophores are coloured brown or\r\ngreen and may either be two parallel (_Exuviella_), or several radially\r\nplaced, discs, which sometimes may coalesce and become a star-shaped\r\nchromatophore. The coloring material (pyrrophyl) consists, in addition\r\nto a modification of chlorophyl, also of _phycopyrrin_ and _peridinin_;\r\nthis colour is sometimes more or less masked by the products of\r\nassimilation which consist of yellow, red or colourless oil (?) and\r\nstarch. Cell-nucleus one: in _Polydinida_ several nuclei are found;\r\ncontractile vacuoles many, which partly open in the cilia-cleft (Fig.\r\n13 _gs_). In some an eye-spot, coloured red by hæmatochrome, is found.\r\nPyrenoids occur perhaps in _Exuviella_ and _Amphidinium_.\r\n\r\nTHE REPRODUCTION takes place as far as is known at present, only\r\nby division. This, in many salt water forms, may take place in the\r\nswarming condition, and, in that case, is always parallel to the\r\nlongitudinal axis. The daughter-individuals, each of which retains half\r\nof the original shell, sometimes do not separate at once from each\r\nother, and thus chains (_e.g._ in _Ceratium_) of several connected\r\nindividuals may be formed. In others, the division occurs after\r\nthe cilia have been thrown off and the cell-contents rounded. The\r\ndaughter-cells then adopt entirely new cell-walls. A palmella-stage\r\n(motionless division-stage) sometimes appears to take place, and also\r\naplanospores (?) with one or two horn-like elongations (_e.g._ in\r\n_Peridinium cinctum_ and _P. tabulatum_); at germination one, or after\r\ndivision, two or more, new individuals may be formed.\r\n\r\nSexual reproduction has not been observed with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe Dinoflagellata move forward or backward, turning round their\r\nlongitudinal axes; in their motion they are influenced by the action\r\nof light. The motion possibly may be produced only by the transverse\r\ncilium, which vibrates rapidly; whilst the longitudinal cilium moves\r\nslowly, and is supposed to serve mainly as a steering apparatus. They\r\nlive principally in salt water, but also in fresh.\r\n\r\nBesides the coloured forms, which are able to make their own organic\r\ncompounds by the splitting up of the carbonic acid contained in the\r\nwater, there are a few colourless forms (_e.g. Gymnodinium spirale_),\r\nor such as do not possess chromatophores (_Polykrikos_); these appear\r\nto live saprophytically, and may be able to absorb solid bodies with\r\nwhich they come in contact.\r\n\r\nDinoflagellata occur in the “Plankton” of the open sea, where they form\r\ntogether with Diatomaceæ the basis for the animal life. It is known\r\nwith certainty that some salt water forms (like the _Noctiluca_,\r\nwhich belongs to the animal kingdom and to which they are perhaps\r\nrelated) produce light, known as phosphorescence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--_A_ and _B Glenodinium cinctum_. _A_\r\n  seen from the ventral side, _B_ from behind; _fg_ transverse\r\n  cilium; _g_ longitudinal cilium; _ch_ chromatophores; _a_ starch;\r\n  _n_ cell-nucleus; _v_ vacuole; _oc_ eye-spot; _C Ceratium\r\n  tetraceros_ from the ventral side; _r_ the right, _b_ the\r\n  posterior horn; _lf_ longitudinal furrow; _gs_ cilium-cleft; _v_\r\n  vacuole; _g_ longitudinal cilium.

They may be divided\r\n   into three orders.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Adinida.= Without transverse or longitudinal furrows, but\r\nenclosed in two shells, and with two parallel chromatophores in each\r\ncell. _Exuviella_, _Prorocentrum_.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Dinifera.= With tranverse and generally longitudinal furrow.\r\nMany radially-placed, disc-formed chromatophores. The most common\r\ngenera are--_Ceratium_ (Fig. 13), _Peridinium_, _Glenodinium_ (Fig.\r\n13), _Gymnodinium_, _Dinophysis_.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Polydinida.= With several transverse furrows, no\r\nchromatophores, and several cell-nuclei. Only one genus--_Polykrikos_.\r\n\r\n   The order _Polydinida_ deviates in a high degree from the\r\n   other Dinoflagellata, not only by its many tranverse furrows,\r\n   each with its own transverse cilium, and by the absence of\r\n   chromatophores, but also in having several cell-nuclei and a\r\n   kind of stinging capsule, which otherwise does not occur within\r\n   the whole class. It may therefore be questionable whether this\r\n   order should really be placed in the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Class 3. =Diatomeæ.=\r\n\r\nThe individuals--each known as a _frustule_--assume very various\r\nforms and may be unicellular or multicellular, but present no\r\ndifferentiation; many similar cells may be connected in chains,\r\nembedded in mucilaginous masses, or attached to mucilaginous\r\nstalks. The cells are bilateral or centric, often asymmetrical,\r\nslightly dorsiventral and have no cilia; those living in the free\r\ncondition have the power of sliding upon a firm substratum. The cell\r\ncontains 1 cell-nucleus and 1–2 plate-shaped or several disc-shaped\r\nchromatophores. The colouring material “_Melinophyl_” contains, in\r\naddition to a modification of chlorophyl, a brown colouring matter,\r\n_diatomin_. 1 or 2 pyrenoids sometimes occur. Starch is wanting and the\r\nfirst product of assimilation appears to be a kind of oil (?).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--_Pinnularia_: _B_, from the edge, shows\r\n  the valves fitting together; _A_, a valve.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Various Diatomaceæ. A _Diatoma vulgare_.\r\n  B _Tabellaria flocculosa_. C _Navicula tumida_ (lateral views).\r\n  D _Gomphonema constrictum_ (lateral views). E _Navicula\r\n  west[=i][=i]_ (lateral views).]\r\n\r\nThe cell-walls are _impregnated with silica_ to such a degree that\r\nthey are imperishable and are therefore able to contribute in a great\r\nmeasure to the formation of the earth’s crust. The structure of their\r\ncell-wall is most peculiar and _differs from all other plants_ (except\r\ncertain Desmidiaceæ); it does not consist of a single piece but is\r\nmade up of two--the “shells”--(compare _Exuviella_ and _Prorocentrum_\r\namong the Dinoflagellata) which are fitted into each other, one being\r\na little larger than the other and embracing its edge, like a box with\r\nits lid (Fig. 14 _B_). The two parts which correspond to the bottom\r\nand lid of the box are known as _valves_. Along the central line of\r\nthe valves a longitudinal _rib_ may often be found, interrupted at\r\nits centre by a small cleft (perhaps homologous with the cilia-cleft\r\nof the Dinoflagellata), through which the protoplasm is enabled to\r\ncommunicate with the exterior (Fig. 14 _A_). It is principally by\r\nreason of the valves, which bear numerous fine, transverse ribs, striæ\r\nor warts, etc. (Figs. 14, 15, 17), that the Diatomeæ have become so\r\nwell known and employed as test objects in microscopical science. When\r\nthe division takes place, the two shells are separated a little from\r\neach other, and after the cell-contents have divided into two masses,\r\ntwo new shells are formed, one fitting into the larger valve, the\r\nother one into the smaller valve of the original frustule. The latter\r\ncell (frustule) is thus, upon the whole, smaller than the mother-cell,\r\nand as the cells do not increase in size, some frustules are smaller\r\nthan the ones from which they are derived, and thus, by repeated\r\ndivisions, it follows that smaller and smaller frustules are produced.\r\nThis continued diminution in size is, however, compensated for by the\r\nformation, when the cells have been reduced to a certain minimum, of\r\n_auxospores_, 2–3 times larger. These may either be formed _asexually_\r\nby the protoplasm of a cell increasing, rounding off and surrounding\r\nitself with a new wall (_e.g. Melosira_) or after _conjugation_,\r\nwhich may take place with various modifications: 1. Two individuals\r\nunite after the secretion of a quantity of mucilage, and the valves\r\nthen commence to separate from each other, on the side which the two\r\nindividuals turn towards each other. The protoplasmic bodies now\r\nrelease themselves from their cell-wall, and each rounds off to form an\r\nellipsoidal mass; these two protoplasmic masses (gametes) coalesce to\r\nform a zygote, the cell-nuclei and chromatophores also fusing together.\r\nThe zygote increases in size, and surrounds itself with a firm, smooth,\r\nsiliceous wall--the _perizonium_. The auxospores, whichever way they\r\narise, are not resting stages. The germination of the zygote commences\r\nby the protoplasm withdrawing itself slightly from the cell-wall and\r\nconstructing first the larger valve, and later on the smaller one;\r\nfinally the membrane of the zygote bursts (_e.g. Himantidium_). 2.\r\nThe conjugation occurs in a similar manner, but the protoplasm of the\r\ncells divides transversely before conjugation into two daughter-cells.\r\nThose lying opposite one another conjugate (Fig. 16) and form two\r\nzygotes. The formation of the perizonium, and germination take place\r\nas in the preceding instance (_e.g. Epithemia_). 3. Two cells place\r\nthemselves parallel to each other, and each of the two cell-contents,\r\nwithout coalescing, becomes an auxospore. The formation of the wall\r\ntakes place as in the preceding case. This is found in the Naviculeæ,\r\nCymbelleæ, the Gomphonemeæ (_e.g. Frustulia_, _Cocconema_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Conjugation of _Cymbella variabilis_.\r\n  _A_, The protoplasm in the two cells has divided into two masses;\r\n  _B_ these masses coalesce in pairs; the cells (_B C_) enclosed\r\n  in a mucilaginous matrix. _C D_ Auxospores and their formation.]\r\n\r\nThe Diatomaceæ may be found in salt as well as in fresh water (often\r\nin such masses that the colour of the water or mud becomes yellow or\r\nbrown; in the same manner the genera _Chætoceros_, _Rhizosolenia_,\r\n_Coscinodiscus_, and several others, form large slime-masses,\r\n“Plankton” on the surface of the sea), on damp soil and in dust blown\r\nby the wind. They occur as fossils in the recent formations, often\r\nin large deposits (siliceous earth, mountain meal), as in the cement\r\nlime in Jutland, the alluvial deposits beneath Berlin, in clay strata\r\nbeneath peat bogs, in guano, etc. These accumulations of fossilized\r\ndiatoms are used in the manufacture of dynamite and in various\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nThe Diatomaceæ appear nearest to, and must be placed as a group\r\nco-ordinate with the Dinoflagellata, as they doubtless may be supposed\r\nto derive their origin from forms resembling _Exuviella_, and to have\r\nlost the cilia. The resemblances to the Desmidiaceæ which are striking\r\nin many respects, can only be conceived as analogies, and cannot be\r\nfounded upon homologies, and it is therefore impossible to regard them\r\nas proof of genetic relationship. The family contains only one order.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Various Diatomeæ. _A Synedra radians._\r\n  _B Epithemia turgida_ (from the two different sides). _C Cymbella\r\n  cuspidata. D Cocconeis pediculus_ (on the right several\r\n  situated on a portion of a plant, on the left a single one more\r\n  highly magnified).]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Diatomaceæ.= This order may be divided into two\r\nsub-orders, viz.--\r\n\r\nSub-Order 1. =Placochromaticæ.= The chromatophores are discoid, large,\r\n1 or 2 in each cell; the structure of the valves is bilateral and\r\nalways without reticulate markings. The following groups belong to\r\nthis sub-order: _Gomphonemeæ_, _Cymbelleæ_, _Amphoreæ_, _Achnantheæ_,\r\n_Cocconeideæ_, _Naviculeæ_, _Amphipleureæ_, _Plagiotropideæ_,\r\n_Amphitropideæ_, _Nitzchieæ_, _Surirayeæ_, and _Eunotieæ_.\r\n\r\nSub-Order 2. =Coccochromaticæ.= The chromatophores are granular, small\r\nand many in each cell. The structure of the cells is zygomorphic\r\nor centric, often with reticulate markings. The following groups\r\nbelong to this sub-order: _Fragilarieæ_, _Meridieæ_, _Tabellarieæ_,\r\n_Licmophoreæ_, _Biddulphieæ_, _Anguliferæ_, _Eupodisceæ_,\r\n_Coscinodisceæ_, and _Melosireæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Class 4. =Schizophyta, Fission-Algæ.=\r\n\r\nThe individuals are 1--many celled; the thallus consists in many of a\r\nsingle cell, in others of chains of cells, the cells dividing in only\r\none definite direction (Figs. 18, 21). In certain Fission-Algæ the\r\ncell-chain branches (Fig. 30) and a difference between the anterior\r\nand the posterior ends of the chain is marked; in some, the cells may\r\nbe united into the form of flat plates by the cell-division taking\r\nplace in two directions; and in others into somewhat cubical masses, or\r\nrounded lumps of a less decided form, by the divisions taking place in\r\nthree directions; or less defined masses may be formed by the divisions\r\ntaking place in all possible directions.\r\n\r\nThe cell-walls rarely contain cellulose, they often swell considerably\r\n(Figs. 20, 22), and show distinct stratifications, or they are almost\r\ncompletely changed into a mucilaginous mass in which the protoplasts\r\nare embedded, _e.g._ in _Nostoc_ (Fig. 22), and in the “Zooglœa” stage\r\nof the Bacteria (Fig. 27). Sexual reproduction is wanting. Vegetative\r\nreproduction by division and the separation of the divisional products\r\nby the splitting of the cell-wall or its becoming mucilaginous; among\r\nthe Nostocaceæ, Lyngbyaceæ, Scytonemaceæ, etc., “Hormogonia” are found;\r\nin _Chamæsiphon_ and others single reproductive akinetes are formed.\r\nMany Fission-Algæ conclude the growing period by the formation of\r\nresting akinetes or aplanospores.\r\n\r\nThe Schizophyta may be divided into 2 families:\r\n\r\n1. SCHIZOPHYCEÆ.\r\n\r\n2. BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Family 1. =Schizophyceæ,[5] Blue-Green Algæ.=\r\n\r\nAll the Blue-green Algæ are able to assimilate carbon by means of\r\na colouring material containing chlorophyll (cyanophyll); but the\r\nchlorophyll in this substance is masked by a blue (phycocyan), or red\r\n(phycoerythrin, _e.g._ in _Trichodesmium erythræum_ in the Red Sea)\r\ncolouring matter which may be extracted from them in cold water after\r\ndeath. The colouring matter, in most of them, permeates the whole of\r\nthe protoplasm (excepting the cell-nucleus), but in a few (_e.g._\r\n_Glaucocystis_, _Phragmonema_), slightly developed chromatophores are\r\nto be found. Where the cells are united into filaments (cell-chains) a\r\ndifferentiation into apex and base (_Rivulariaceæ_) may take place, and\r\nalso between ordinary vegetative cells and heterocysts; these latter\r\ncannot divide, and are distinguished from the ordinary vegetative cells\r\n(Fig. 22 _h_) by their larger size, yellow colour, and poverty of\r\ncontents. Branching sometimes occurs and is either true or spurious.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--_Microcoleus lyngbyanus_: _a_ portion of\r\n  a filament, the thick sheath encloses only one cell-chain; in one\r\n  place a cell is drawn out by the movement of the cell-chain; _b_\r\n  the cell-chain has divided into two parts (“hormongonia”) which\r\n  commence to separate from each other.]\r\n\r\nThe cell-chain in the spurious branching divides into two parts,\r\nof which either one or both grow beyond the place of division\r\n(Fig. 18) and often out to both sides (_e.g. Scytonema_), the\r\ndivisions however, always take place transversely to the longitudinal\r\ndirection of the cell-chain. In the true branching a cell elongates\r\nin the direction transverse to the cell-chain, and the division\r\nthen takes place nearly at right angles to the former direction\r\n(_Sirosiphoniaceæ_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--_Cylindrospermum majus_: _a_ resting\r\n  akinete with heterocyst; _b-d_ germinating stages of a resting\r\n  akinete; _e_ filament with two heterocysts and the formation\r\n  of new akinetes; _f_ part of a filament with a heterocyst, and\r\n  mature resting akinete.]\r\n\r\nCilia are wanting, but the filaments are sometimes self-motile (_e.g._\r\nhormogonia in _Nostoc_) and many partly turn round their axes, partly\r\nslide forward or backward (_Oscillaria_).\r\n\r\nReproduction takes place by spores and hormogonia in addition to simple\r\ncell-division. Hormogonia are peculiar fragments of a cell-chain\r\ncapable of motion, and often exhibit a vigorous motion in the sheath,\r\nuntil at last they escape and grow into a new individual (Fig. 18).\r\nThe spores are reproductive akinetes (_Chamæsiphon_, etc.) or resting\r\nakinetes; these latter arise by the vegetative cells enlarging and\r\nconstructing a thick cell-wall (Fig. 19 _e f_). On germination,\r\nthis cell-wall bursts and the new cell-chain elongates in the same\r\nlongitudinal direction as before (Fig. 19 _b c_). Many (_e.g._\r\n_Oscillaria_) may however winter in their ordinary vegetative stage.\r\nAplanospores are wanting.\r\n\r\nThe Fission-Algæ are very prevalent in fresh water and on damp soil,\r\nless so in salt water; they also often occur in water which abounds in\r\ndecaying matter. Some are found in warm springs with a temperature as\r\nhigh as 50° C.\r\n\r\nThe Family may be divided into 2 sub-families:\r\n\r\n1. HOMOCYSTEÆ (heterocysts are wanting): _Chroococcaceæ_, _Lyngbyaceæ_\r\nand _Chamœsiphonaceæ_.\r\n\r\n2. HETEROCYSTEÆ (heterocysts present): _Nostocaceæ_, _Rivulariaceæ_,\r\n_Scytonemaceæ_ and _Sirosiphoniaceæ_.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Chroococcaceæ.= The individuals are 1--many-celled, but all\r\nthe cells are uniform, united to form plates or irregular masses, often\r\nsurrounded by a mucilaginous cell-wall, but never forming cell-chains.\r\nMultiplication by division and sometimes by resting akinetes, but\r\nreproductive akinetes are wanting. _Chroococcus_, _Aphanocapsa_,\r\n_Glœocapsa_ (Fig. 20), _Cœlosphærium_, _Merismopedium_, _Glaucocystis_,\r\n_Oncobyrsa_, _Polycystis_, _Gomphosphæria_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--_Glœocapsa atrata_: _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_,\r\n  _E_ various stages of development.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--_Oscillaria_; =a= terminal, =b= central\r\n  portion of a filament.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Lyngbyaceæ (Oscillariaceæ).= The cells are discoid (Fig.\r\n21), united to straight or spirally twisted, free filaments, which are\r\nunbranched, or with spurious branching. The ends of the cell-chains\r\nare similar. Heterocysts absent. Reproduction by synakinetes, resting\r\nakinetes are wanting. _Oscillaria_ (Fig. 21), _Spirulina_, _Lyngbya_,\r\n_Microcoleus_, _Symploca_, _Plectonema_.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Chamæsiphonaceæ.= The individuals are 1--many-celled,\r\nattached, unbranched filaments with differentiation into apex and base,\r\nwithout heterocysts. Multiplication by reproductive akinetes; resting\r\nakinetes are wanting. _Dermocarpa_, _Clastidium_, _Chamæsiphon_,\r\n_Godlewskia_, _Phragmonema_.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Nostocaceæ.= The individuals are formed of multicellular,\r\nunbranched filaments, without differentiation into apex and base;\r\nheterocysts present. Reproduction by synakinetes and resting akinetes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--_Nostoc verrucosum. A_ The plant in\r\n  its natural size; an irregularly folded jelly-like mass. _B_ One\r\n  of the cell-chains enlarged, with its heterocysts (_h_), embedded\r\n  in its mucilaginous sheath.]\r\n\r\nSome genera are not mucilaginous, _e.g. Cylindrospermum_ (Fig. 19).\r\nThe cell-chains in others, _e.g. Nostoc_, wind in between one another\r\nand are embedded in large structureless jelly-like masses, which may\r\nattain the size of a plum or even larger (Fig. 22); sometimes they are\r\nfound floating in the water, sometimes attached to other bodies. Other\r\ngenera as follows: _Aphanizomenon_ and _Anabæna_ (in lakes and smaller\r\npieces of water); _Nodularia_ is partly pelagic. Some occur in the\r\nintercellular spaces of higher plants, thus _Nostoc_-forms are found\r\nin _Anthoceros_, _Blasia_, _Sphagnum_, _Lemna_, and in the roots of\r\n_Cycas_ and _Gunnera_; _Anabæna_ in _Azolla_.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Rivulariaceæ.= The individuals are multicellular filaments,\r\nwith differentiation into apex and base; spurious branching, and a\r\nheterocyst at the base of each filament, reproduction by synakinetes\r\nand resting akinetes, rarely by simple reproductive akinetes.\r\n_Rivularia_, _Glœotrichia_, _Isactis_, _Calothrix_.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Scytonemaceæ.= The individuals are formed of multicellular\r\nfilaments with no longitudinal division; differentiation into apex and\r\nbase very slight or altogether absent; branching spurious; heterocysts\r\npresent. Reproduction by synakinetes, rarely by resting akinetes and\r\nordinary reproductive akinetes. _Tolypothrix_, _Scytonema_, _Hassalia_,\r\n_Microchæte_.\r\n\r\nOrder 7. =Sirosiphoniaceæ.= The individuals are formed of multicellular\r\nthreads with longitudinal divisions; true branching and heterocysts,\r\nand often distinct differentiation into apex and base. Reproduction\r\nby synakinetes, rarely by resting akinetes and ordinary reproductive\r\nakinetes. _Hapalosiphon_, _Stigonema_, _Capsosira_, _Nostocopsis_,\r\n_Mastigocoleus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 2. =Bacteria.=[6]\r\n\r\nThe Bacteria (also known as Schizomycetes, and Fission-Fungi) are the\r\nsmallest known organisms, and form a parallel group to the Blue-green\r\nAlgæ, but separated from these Algæ by the absence of their colouring\r\nmaterial; chlorophyll is only found in a few Bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe various forms under which the vegetative condition of the Bacteria\r\nappear, are termed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. GLOBULAR FORMS, COCCI (Figs. 27, 30 _c_): spherical or ellipsoidal,\r\nsingle cells, which, however, are usually loosely massed together and\r\ngenerally termed “_Micrococci_.”\r\n\r\n2. ROD-LIKE FORMS: more or less elongated bodies; the shorter forms\r\nhave been styled “_Bacterium_” (in the narrower sense of the word),\r\nand the term “_Bacillus_” has been applied to longer forms which are\r\nstraight and cylindrical (Figs. 28, 29, 30 _E_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 23.--_Spirillum sanguineum._ Four specimens.\r\n  One has two cilia at the same end, the sulphur grains are seen\r\n  internally.]\r\n\r\n3. THREAD-LIKE FORMS: unbranched, long, round filaments, resembling\r\nthose of _Oscillaria_, are possessed by _Leptothrix_ (very thin,\r\nnon-granular filaments; Fig. 30 _A_, the small filaments) and\r\n_Beggiatoa_ (thicker filaments, with strong, refractile grains or drops\r\nof sulphur (Fig. 31); often self-motile). Branched filaments, with\r\nfalse branching like many _Scytonemaceæ_, are found in _Cladothrix_\r\n(Fig. 30 _B_, _G_).\r\n\r\n4. SPIRAL FORMS: Rod-like or filamentous bodies, which more or less\r\nstrongly resemble a corkscrew with a spiral rising to the left. In\r\ngeneral these are termed _Spirilla_ (Fig. 23); very attenuated spirals,\r\n_Vibriones_ (standing next to Fig. 30 _M_); if the filaments are\r\nslender and flexible with a closely wound spiral, _Spirochætæ_ (Fig.\r\n24).\r\n\r\n5. The MERISMOPEDIUM-FORM, consisting of rounded cells arranged in\r\none plane, generally in groups of four, and produced by divisions\r\nperpendicular to each other.\r\n\r\n6. The SARCINA-FORM, consisting of roundish cells which are produced\r\nby cellular division in all the three directions of space, united into\r\nglobular or ovoid masses (“parcels”) _e.g. Sarcina ventriculi_ (Figs.\r\n25, 26).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 24.--_Spirochæte obermeieri_, in active\r\n  motion (_b_) and shortly before the termination of the fever\r\n  (_c_); a blood corpuscles.]\r\n\r\nAll Bacteria are unicellular. In the case of the micrococci this is\r\nself-evident, but in the “rod,” “thread,” and “spiral” Bacteria, very\r\noften numerous cells remain united together and their individual\r\nelements can only be recognised by the use of special reagents.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 25.--_Sarcina ventriculi._ One surface only\r\n  is generally seen. Those cells which are drawn with double\r\n  contour are seen with the correct focus, and more distinctly than\r\n  those cells lying deeper drawn with single contour.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 26.--_Sarcina minuta_: _a-d_ successive\r\n  stages of one individual (from 4–10 p.m.); _f_ an individual of\r\n  32 cells.]\r\n\r\nThe condition termed “Zooglœa,” which reminds us of _Nostoc_, is\r\nproduced by the cells becoming strongly mucilaginous. A number of\r\nindividuals in active division are found embedded in a mass of\r\nmucilage, which either contains only one, or sometimes more, of the\r\nabove-named forms. The individuals may eventually swarm out and\r\ncontinue their development in an isolated condition. Such mucilaginous\r\nmasses occur especially upon moist vegetables (potatoes, etc.), on the\r\nsurface of fluids with decaying raw or cooked materials, etc. The\r\nmucilaginous envelope is thrown into folds when the Bacteria, with\r\ntheir mucilaginous cell-walls, multiply so rapidly that there is no\r\nmore room on the surface of the fluid.\r\n\r\nThe cells of the Bacteria are constructed like other plant-cells in\r\nso far as their diminutive size has allowed us to observe them. The\r\ncell-wall only exceptionally shows the reactions of cellulose (in\r\n_Sarcina_, _Leuconostoc_; also in a Vinegar-bacterium, _Bacterium\r\nxylinum_); a mucilaginous external layer is always present. The body\r\nof the cell mostly appears to be an uniform or finely granulated\r\nprotoplasm. Very few species (_e.g. Bacillus virens_) contain\r\nchlorophyll; others are coloured red (purple sulphur Bacteria); the\r\nmajority are colourless. _Bacillus amylobacter_ shows a reaction\r\nof a starch-like material when treated with iodine before the\r\nspore-formation. Some Bacteria contain sulphur (see p. 37). The body,\r\nwhich has been described as a _cell-nucleus_, is still of a doubtful\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nArtificial colourings with aniline dyes (especially methyl-violet,\r\ngentian-violet, methylene-blue, fuchsin, Bismarck-brown and Vesuvin)\r\nplay an important part in the investigations of Bacteria.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT. Many Bacteria are self-motile; the long filaments of\r\n_Beggiatoa_ exhibit movements resembling those of _Oscillaria_. In many\r\nmotile forms the presence of cilia or flagella has been proved by the\r\nuse of stains; many forms have one, others several cilia attached at\r\none or both ends (Fig. 23) or distributed irregularly over the whole\r\nbody; the cilia are apparently elongations of the mucilaginous covering\r\nand not, as in the other Algæ of the protoplasm. In _Spirochæte_ the\r\nmovement is produced by the flexibility of the cell itself. Generally\r\nspeaking, the motion resembles that of swarm-cells (_i.e._ rotation\r\nround the long axis and movement in irregular paths); but either end\r\nhas an equal power of proceeding forwards.\r\n\r\n   The swarming motion must not be confounded with the hopping\r\n   motion of the very minute particles under the microscope\r\n   (Brownian movement).\r\n\r\nVEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION takes place by continued transverse division;\r\nhence the name “Fission-Fungi” or “Fission-Algæ,” has been applied to\r\nthe Bacteria.\r\n\r\nSPORES. The spores are probably developed in two ways. In the\r\nENDOSPOROUS species (Figs. 28, 29), the spore arises as a new cell\r\ninside the mother-cell. The spores are strongly refractile, smaller\r\nthan the mother-cell, and may be compared to the aplanospores of other\r\nAlgæ. In addition to these there are the ARTHROSPOROUS species in\r\nwhich the cells, just as in _Nostoc_ and other Blue-green Algæ, assume\r\nthe properties of spores without previously undergoing an endogenous\r\nnew construction, and are able to germinate and form new vegetative\r\ngenerations (Fig. 27). The formation of spores very often commences\r\nwhen the vegetative development begins to be restricted.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 27.--_Leuconostoc mesenterioides_: _a_\r\n  a zooglœa, natural size; _b_ cross section of zooglœa; _c_\r\n  filaments with spores; _d_ mature spores; _e-i_ successive stages\r\n  of germination; in _e_ portions of the ruptured spore-wall are\r\n  seen on the external side of the mucilaginous covering. (_b-i_\r\n  magnified 520.)]\r\n\r\nThe spores germinate as in _Nostoc_ by the bursting of the external\r\nlayer of the cell-wall, either by a transverse or longitudinal cleft,\r\nbut always in the same way, in the same species (Fig. 28, example of\r\ntransverse cleft).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION. Bacteria and their germs capable of development, are\r\nfound everywhere, in the air (dust), in surface water, and in the\r\nsuperficial layers of the soil. The number varies very much in\r\naccordance with the nature of the place, season, etc. They enter,\r\ntogether with air and food, into healthy animals and occur always in\r\ntheir alimentary tract.\r\n\r\nGROWTH AND REPRODUCTION depend upon the conditions of temperature.\r\nThere is a certain minimum, optimum and maximum for each species; for\r\ninstance (in degrees Centigrade)--\r\n\r\n                                  Minim.     Opt.

(After de\r\n  Bary; mag. 600 times, with the exception of _s_, which is more\r\n  highly magnified.)]\r\n\r\nThe functions of life cease on a slight excess of the maximum or\r\nminimum temperature, numbness setting in when either of these limits\r\nis passed. _Crenothrix_-threads provided with mucilaginous envelopes\r\nmay, according to Zopf, sustain a temperature of-10°. Some Bacteria are\r\nsaid to be able to resist the exposure to as low a temperature as-110°\r\nfor a short time. It is not known at what degree of cold the death of\r\nthe Bacteria occurs: the greatest degree of heat which the vegetative\r\ncells can withstand is about the same as that for other vegetative\r\nplant-cells, namely, about 50–60° C. Certain Bacteria, _e.g. B.\r\nthermophilus_, grow and thrive vigorously at 70° C. Many spores, on the\r\ncontrary, are able to bear far higher temperatures (in several species\r\na temperature for some duration of above 100°, those of _Bacillus\r\nsubtilis_, for instance, can withstand for hours a temperature of 100°\r\nin nutrient solutions; the spores remain capable of development after\r\nexposure to a dry heat of 123° C.).\r\n\r\nThe _Desiccation_ of the air, if prolonged, kills many forms when in\r\nthe vegetative condition. The spores however can bear a much longer\r\nperiod of dryness, some even several years.\r\n\r\nOXYGEN. Some species cannot live without a supply of free oxygen\r\n(_Aerobic_), _e.g._ the Vinegar-bacteria, the Hay-bacilli, the\r\nAnthrax-bacilli, the Cholera-_Microspira_. Other species again thrive\r\nvigorously without supply of free oxygen, and are even checked in their\r\ndevelopment by the admission of air (_Anaerobic_), _e.g._ the butyric\r\nacid Bacterium (_Clostridium butyricium_ = _Bacillus amylobacter_).\r\nA distinction may be drawn between obligate and facultative aerobics\r\nand obligate and facultative anaerobics. Several Bacteria, producing\r\nfermentation, may grow without the aid of oxygen when they are living\r\nin a solution in which they can produce fermentation; but, if this is\r\nnot the case, they can only grow when a supply of oxygen is available.\r\nA great number of the pathogenic Bacteria belong to the facultative\r\nanaerobics.\r\n\r\nA luminous Bacterium (_Bacillus phosphorescens_) which in the presence\r\nof a supply of oxygen gives a bluish-white light, has been found in\r\nsea-water. Phosphorescent Bacteria have frequently been observed\r\nupon decaying sea-fish, as well as on the flesh of other animals; by\r\ntransferring the Bacteria from cod fish to beef, etc., the latter may\r\nbe made luminous.\r\n\r\n_Organic carbon compounds_ are indispensable for all Bacteria, (except,\r\nas it appears, for the nitrifying organisms), as they can only obtain\r\nthe necessary supplies of _carbon_ from this source. The supplies\r\nof _nitrogen_, which also they cannot do without, can be obtained\r\nequally as well from organic compounds as from inorganic salts, such as\r\nsaltpetre or ammonia-compounds. The various “ash-constituents” are also\r\nessential for their nourishment.\r\n\r\nWhile Moulds and Yeast-Fungi grow best in an acid substratum, the\r\n_Bacteria_, on the other hand, generally thrive _best_ in a _neutral_\r\nor slightly _alkaline_ one.\r\n\r\nIn _sterilization_, _disinfection_, and _antisepsis_, means are\r\nemployed by which the Bacteria are killed, or checked in their\r\ndevelopment, for instance, by heat (ignition, cooking, hot vapours,\r\nhot air, etc.), or poisons (acids, corrosive sublimate). The process\r\nof preserving articles of food, in which they are boiled and then\r\nhermetically sealed, aims at destroying the Bacteria, or the spores of\r\nthose which already may be present in them, and excluding all others.\r\n\r\nAs the Bacteria are unable to assimilate carbon from the carbonic\r\nacid of the air, but must obtain it from the carbon-compounds already\r\nin existence in the organic world, they are either _saprophytes_\r\nor _parasites_. Some are exclusively either the one or the other,\r\n_obligate_ saprophytes or parasites. But there are transitional\r\nforms among them, some of which are at ordinary times saprophytes,\r\nbut may, when occasion offers, complete their development wholly or\r\npartly as parasites--_facultative parasites_; others are generally\r\nparasitic, but may also pass certain stages of development as\r\nsaprophytes--_facultative saprophytes_.\r\n\r\nAll chlorophyll-free organisms act in a transforming and disturbing\r\nmanner on the organic compounds from which they obtain their\r\nnourishment, and while they themselves grow and multiply, they produce,\r\neach after its kind, compounds of a less degree of complexity, _i.e._\r\nthey produce _fermentation_, _putrefaction_, sometimes the formation of\r\n_poisons_, and in living beings often _disease_.\r\n\r\nThose organisms which produce fermentation are called _ferments_;\r\nthis word, however, is also employed for similar transformations in\r\npurely chemical materials (inorganic ferments or enzymes). Many organic\r\n(“living”) ferments, among which are Yeast-cells and Bacteria, give\r\noff during their development certain inorganic and soluble ferments\r\n(enzymes) which may produce other transformations without themselves\r\nbeing changed. Different organisms may produce in the same substratum\r\ndifferent kinds of transformation; alcoholic fermentation may for\r\ninstance be produced by different species of Fungi, but in different\r\nproportions, and the same species produces in different substrata,\r\ndifferent transformations (_e.g._ the Vinegar-bacteria oxydize diluted\r\nalcohol to vinegar, and eventually to carbonic acid and water).\r\n\r\n   In the study of Bacteria it is absolutely necessary to sterilize\r\n   the vessels employed in cultivation, the apparatus, and nutrient\r\n   solutions, _i.e._ to free them from Bacteria germs and\r\n   also to preserve the cultures from the intrusion of any foreign\r\n   germs (“pure-cultures”). A firm, transparent, nutritive medium\r\n   is frequently employed. This may be prepared by adding to\r\n   the nutrient solutions (broth) either gelatine, or--when the\r\n   Bacteria are to be cultivated at blood-heat--serum of sheep’s or\r\n   calf’s blood, agar-agar or carragen; serum alone may in itself\r\n   serve as a nutrient medium. The so-called “plate-cultures” are\r\n   frequently employed, _i.e._ the germs are isolated by\r\n   shaking them with the melted liquid nutrient gelatine, which\r\n   is then spread on a glass plate and allowed to coagulate; when\r\n   later on the individual germs grow into colonies, these remain\r\n   separate in the solid substratum and it is easy to pursue\r\n   their further development. Similar plate-cultures may also be\r\n   cultivated in test-tubes and on microscopic slides. The slides\r\n   and glass plates must be placed in “moist chambers” free from\r\n   Bacteria. By sowing a few cells (if possible one) using a fine\r\n   platinum wire, pure cultures for further investigation may be\r\n   obtained.\r\n\r\n   In order to prove the relationship between pathogenic Bacteria\r\n   and certain diseases, the experimental production of pathogenic\r\n   Bacteria by the inoculation of Bacteria from pure cultures into\r\n   healthy animals, is very important.\r\n\r\nIt has not so far been possible to establish a _classification_\r\nof the Bacteria, as the life-history of many species, has not yet\r\nbeen sufficiently investigated.[7] The opinions of botanists are at\r\nvariance, in many cases, about the forms of growth of a particular\r\nkind. Some species are pleomorphic (many-formed) while others possess\r\nonly one form.\r\n\r\nThe following Bacteria are =Saprophytes=:--\r\n\r\n_Cladothrix dichotoma_ is common in stagnant and running water which is\r\nimpregnated with organic matter; the cell-chains have false branching.\r\nAccording to Zopf, _Leptothrix ochracea_ is one of the forms of this\r\nspecies which, in water containing ferrous iron (_e.g._ as FeCO_{3}),\r\nregularly embeds ferric-oxide in its sheath by means of the activity\r\nof the protoplasm. _Leptothrix ochracea_ and other Iron-bacteria,\r\naccording to Winogradsky (1888), do not continue their growth in water\r\nfree from protoxide of iron; while they multiply enormously in water\r\nwhich contains this salt of iron. The large masses of ochre-coloured\r\nslime, found in meadows, bogs, and lakes, are probably due to the\r\nactivity of the Iron-bacteria.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 30.--_Cladothrix dichotoma._]\r\n\r\nThose forms which, according to Zopf’s views, represent the forms\r\nof development of _Cladothrix dichotoma_ are placed together in\r\nFig. 30. A represents a group of plants, seventy times magnified,\r\nattached to a Vaucheria. The largest one is branched like a tree, with\r\nbranches of ordinary form; a specimen with spirally twisted branches\r\nis seen to the right of the figure, at the lower part some small\r\n_Leptothrix_-like forms. _B_ shows the manner of branching and an\r\nincipient _Coccus_-formation. _C_ a _Coccus_-mass whose exit from the\r\nsheath has been observed. _D_ the same mass as _C_ after the course of\r\na day, the Cocci having turned into _rods_. _E_ a group of Cocci in\r\nwhich some have developed into shorter or longer rods. _F_ one of these\r\nrods before and after treatment with picric acid, which causes the\r\nchain-like structure to become apparent. _G_ a portion of a plant with\r\nconspicuous sheath, two lateral branches are being formed. _H_ part of\r\na plant, whose cells have divided and form Cocci. The original form\r\nof the cells in which the Cocci are embedded may still be recognised.\r\nI. _Leptothrix_-filaments with conspicuous mucilaginous sheath, from\r\nwhich a series of rods is about to emerge; the rod near the bottom\r\nis dead, and has remained lying in the sheath. _K_ part of a plant\r\nwhich is forming Cocci, those at the top are in the zooglœa-stage, at\r\nthe base they are elongating to form rods and _Leptothrix_-filaments.\r\n_L_ a portion of a branched _Cladothrix_, which divides into motile\r\n_Bacillus_-forms; the rays at the free ends indicate the currents\r\nwhich the cilia produce in the water. _M_ a spirally-twisted, swarming\r\nfilament, before and after division into halves. _N_ part of a\r\ntree-like zooglœa with Cocci and short rods.--All of these spirilla,\r\nzooglœa, etc., which Zopf has connected with _Clad. dichotoma_, are\r\naccording to Winogradsky, independent organisms.\r\n\r\n_Micrococcus ureæ_ produces _urinal fermentation_ (transformation of\r\nurinal matter into ammonium carbonate); aerobic; round cells generally\r\nunited to form bent chains or a zooglœa.--Several other kinds of\r\nBacteria have the same action as this one: in damp soil containing\r\nammonia-compounds, _saltpetre-formations_ are produced by _M.\r\nnitrificans_ and several different kinds of Bacteria.\r\n\r\n_Micrococcus prodigiosus_ is found on articles of food containing\r\nstarch; “bleeding bread” is caused by this Bacterium, which has the\r\npower of forming a red pigment; it also occurs in milk, and produces\r\nlactic acid.\r\n\r\n_Leuconostoc mesenterioides_ is the frog-spawn Bacterium (Fig. 27)\r\nwhich is found in sugar manufactories, and has the power of producing\r\na viscous fermentation in saccharine solutions which have been derived\r\nfrom plants, _e.g._ in beetroot-sugar manufactories, where large\r\naccumulations of mucilage are formed at the expense of the sugar, with\r\nan evolution of carbonic acid. The cell-rows, resembling somewhat a\r\npearl necklace, have thick mucilaginous cell-walls, and form white\r\n“Nostoc”-lumps. The mucilage eventually deliquesces and the cells\r\nseparate from each other; arthrospores?--Similar viscous deteriorations\r\noccur in beer and wine, which may then be drawn out into long, string\r\nlike filaments--“ropiness.”\r\n\r\n_Bacterium aceti_, the Vinegar-bacterium, oxidizes alcohol into\r\nacetic acid (acetous-fermentation) and forms a greyish covering of\r\nBacteria (“Vinegar-mother”) on the surface of the liquid; the acetic\r\nacid formed, becomes by continued oxidization by _B. aceti_, again\r\ntransformed into carbonic acid and water. Aerobic; short cylindrical\r\ncells, often united into chains, or to form a zooglœa; sometimes also\r\nrod-and spindle-shaped. The Vinegar-bacteria and other kinds with\r\nball- or rod-forms sometimes become swollen, spindle-shaped, or oval\r\nlinks; they are supposed to be diseased forms[8] (“Involution-forms”).\r\n\r\n_Bacillus lacticus_ (_Bacterium acidi lactici_, Zopf) is always found\r\nin milk which has stood for some time, and in sour foods (cabbage,\r\ncucumbers, etc.); it turns the milk sour by producing lactic acid\r\nfermentation in the sugar contained in the milk; the lactic acid\r\nformed, eventually causes the coagulation of the casein. It resembles\r\nthe Vinegar-bacteria, occurring as small cylindrical cells, rarely in\r\nshort rows; not self-motile.--Several other Bacteria appear to act in\r\nthe same way, some occurring in the mouth of human beings; some of\r\nthese Bacteria give to butter its taste and flavour.\r\n\r\nThe _kefir-grains_ which are added to milk for the preparation of\r\nkefir, contain in large numbers a Bacterium (_Dispora caucasica_) in\r\nthe zooglœa-form, a Yeast-fungus, and _Bacillus lacticus_. Kefir is a\r\nsomewhat alcoholic sour milk, rich in carbonic acid; it is a beverage\r\nmanufactured by the inhabitants of the Caucasus, from the milk of cows,\r\ngoats, or sheep, and is sometimes used as a medicine. In the production\r\nof kefir, lactic acid fermentation takes place in one part of the sugar\r\ncontained in the milk, and alcoholic fermentation in another part, and\r\nthe casein which had become curdled is partially liquefied (peptonised)\r\nby an enzyme of a Zooglœa-bacterium.\r\n\r\n_Bacillus amylobacter_ (_Bacillus butyricus_), the\r\nButyric-acid-bacterium (Fig. 29), is a very common anaerobic which\r\nproduces fermentation in sugar and lactic-acid salts, and whose\r\nprincipal product is _butyric acid_. It destroys articles of\r\nfood and (together with other species) plays a part in the butyric\r\nacid fermentation which is necessary in the making of cheese; it is\r\nvery active wherever portions of plants are decaying, in destroying\r\nthe cellulose in the cell-walls of herbaceous plants, and is thus\r\nuseful in the preparation of flax and hemp. The cells are self-motile,\r\ngenerally cylindrical, sometimes united into short rows; endosporous;\r\nthe spore-forming cells swell, assume very different forms, and show\r\ngranulose reaction. The germ-tube grows out in the direction of the\r\nlong axis of the spore.\r\n\r\n_Bacillus subtilis_, the Hay-bacillus, is developed in all decoctions\r\nof hay; a slender, aerobic, self-motile Bacillus; endosporous\r\n(aplanospores); the spore-wall ruptures transversely on germination.\r\n\r\n_Crenothrix kuehniana_ occurs in the springs of many baths, in wells, in\r\nwater or drain-pipes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 31.--_Beggiatoa alba_: _a_ from a fluid\r\n  containing abundance of sulphuretted hydrogen; _b_ after lying 24\r\n  hours in a solution devoid of sulphuretted hydrogen; _c_ after\r\n  lying an additional 48 hours in a solution devoid of sulphuretted\r\n  hydrogen, by this means the transverse walls and vacuoles have\r\n  become visible.]\r\n\r\n_Beggiatoa_ (parallel with the Blue-green Alga _Oscillaria_). Long\r\nfilaments formed of cylindrical cells which are attached by one\r\nof the ends, but which are nearly always free when observed. The\r\nfilaments, like those of _Oscillaria_, describe conical figures in\r\ntheir revolutions, the free filaments slide upwards and parallel with\r\none another; sheaths are wanting; strongly refractive sulphur drops\r\nare found in the interior. The Beggiatoas are the most prevalent\r\n_Sulphur-bacteria_. They occur, very commonly in large numbers,\r\nwherever plant or animal remains are decaying in water in which\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen is being formed; thus, for example, _B. alba_\r\n(Fig. 31) occurs frequently as a white covering or slimy film on mud\r\ncontaining organic remains. ~_B. mirabilis_ is remarkable for its\r\nsize and its strong peristaltic movements.~ The Sulphur-bacteria\r\noxidize the sulphuretted hydrogen, and accumulate sulphur in the\r\nshape of small granules of soft amorphic sulphur, which in the living\r\ncell never passes over into the crystalline state. They next oxidize\r\nthis sulphur into sulphuric acid, which is immediately rendered\r\nneutral by absorbed salts of calcium, and is given off in the form\r\nof a sulphate, thus CaCO_{3} is principally changed into CaSO_{4}.\r\nIn the absence of sulphur the nutritive processes are suspended, and\r\nconsequently death occurs either sooner or later. The Sulphur-bacteria\r\nmay exist and multiply in a fluid which only contains traces of\r\norganic matter, in which organisms devoid of chlorophyll are not able\r\nto exist. The Beggiatoas very frequently form white, bulky masses\r\nin sulphur wells and in salt water, the traces of organic material\r\nwhich the sulphur water contains proving sufficient for them. ~The\r\ncellulose-fermentation, to which the sulphur wells in all probability\r\nowe their origin, mainly procures them suitable conditions for\r\nexistence. The CaCO_{3} and H_{2}S, formed during the cellulose\r\nfermentation by the reduction of CaSO_{4} is again changed into\r\nCaSO_{4} and CO_{2} by the Sulphur-bacteria (Winogradsky, 1887).--Other\r\nSulphur-bacteria, the so-called purple Sulphur-bacteria, _e.g._\r\n_B. roseo-persicina_, _Spirillum sanguineum_ (Fig. 23), _Bacterium\r\nsulfuratum_, etc., have their protoplasm mixed with a red colouring\r\nmatter (bacterio-purpurin) which, like chlorophyll, has the power,\r\nin the presence of light, of giving off oxygen (as proved by T. W.\r\nEnglemann, 1888, in oxygen-sensitive Bacteria). The three purple\r\nSulphur-bacteria mentioned, are, according to Winogradsky, not\r\npleomorphic kinds but embrace numerous species.~\r\n\r\nMany _Spirilli_ (_Spirillum tenue_, _S. undula_, _S. plicatile_, and\r\nothers) are found prevalent in decaying liquids.\r\n\r\nBacteria (especially Bacilli) are the cause of many substances emitting\r\na foul odour, and of various changes in milk.\r\n\r\n=Parasitic Bacteria= live in other living organisms; but the relation\r\nbetween “host” and parasite may vary in considerable degree. Some\r\nparasites do no injury to their host, others produce dangerous\r\ncontagious diseases; some choose only a special kind as host, others\r\nagain live equally well in many different ones. There are further\r\nspecific and individual differences with regard to the _predisposition_\r\nof the host, and every individual has not the same receptivity at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nTHE HARMLESS PARASITES OF HUMAN BEINGS. Several of the above mentioned\r\nsaprophytes may also occur in the alimentary canal of human beings;\r\n_e.g._, the Hay-bacillus, the Butyric-acid-bacillus, etc.; but the\r\ngastric juice prevents the development of others, at all events in\r\ntheir vegetative condition. _Sarcina ventriculi_, “packet-bacterium,”\r\nis only known to occur in the stomach and intestines of human beings,\r\nand makes its appearance in certain diseases of the stomach (dilation\r\nof the stomach, etc.) in great numbers, without, however, being the\r\ncause of the disease. It occurs in somewhat cubical masses of roundish\r\ncells (Fig. 25).\r\n\r\nLESS DANGEROUS PARASITES. In the mouth, especially between and on\r\nthe teeth, a great many Bacteria are to be found (more than fifty\r\nspecies are known), _e.g. Leptothrix buccalis_ (long, brittle,\r\nvery thin filaments which are united into bundles), Micrococci in\r\nlarge lumps, _Spirochæte cohnii_, etc. Some of them are known to be\r\ninjurious, as they contribute in various ways to the decay of the\r\nteeth (_caries dentium_); a _Micrococcus_, for instance, forms lactic\r\nacid in materials containing sugar and starch, and the acid dissolves\r\nthe lime salts in the external layers of the teeth: those parts of\r\nthe teeth thus deprived of lime are attacked by other Bacteria, and\r\nbecome dissolved. Inflammation in the tissues at the root of a tooth,\r\nis probably produced by septic materials which have been formed by\r\nBacteria in the root-canal.\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS PARASITES. In a large number of the infectious diseases of\r\nhuman beings and animals, it has been possible to prove that parasitic\r\nBacteria have been the cause of the disease. Various pathogenic\r\nBacteria of this nature, belonging to the coccus, rod, and spiral\r\nBacteria groups, are mentioned in the following:--\r\n\r\n=Pathogenic Micrococci.= _Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus_ produces\r\nabscesses of various natures (boils, suppurative processes in internal\r\norgans). The same effects are produced by--\r\n\r\n_Streptococcus pyogenes_, which is the most frequent cause of malignant\r\npuerperal fever; it is perhaps identical with--\r\n\r\n_Streptococcus erysipelatis_, which is the cause of erysipelas in human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\n_Diplococcus pneumoniæ_ (A. Fränkel) is the cause of pneumonia, and of\r\nthe epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis.\r\n\r\n_Gonococcus_ (Neisser) is the cause of gonorrhea and inflammation of\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\n=Pathogenic Rod-Bacteria.= _Bacterium choleræ gallinarum_, an aerobic,\r\nfacultative parasite which produces fowl-cholera among poultry; it is\r\neasily cultivated on various substrata as a saprophyte. The disease\r\nmay be conveyed both through wounds and by food, and may also be\r\ncommunicated to mammals.\r\n\r\n_Bacillus anthracis_, the _Anthrax bacillus_ (Fig. 32), chiefly attacks\r\nmammals, especially herbivorous animals (house mice, guinea-pigs,\r\nrabbits, sheep, cattle), in a less degree omnivorous animals (including\r\nhuman beings), and in a still less degree the Carnivores. Aerobic.\r\nCylindrical cells, 3–4 times as long as broad, united into long\r\nrod-like bodies, which may elongate into long, bent, and twisted\r\nfilaments. Not self-motile. Endosporous. Germination takes place\r\nwithout the throwing off of any spore-membrane (compare Hay-bacillus p.\r\n37 which resembles it). Contagion may take place both by introduction\r\ninto wounds, and from the mucous membrane of the intestines or lungs,\r\nboth by vegetative cells and by spores; in intestinal anthrax, however,\r\nonly by spores. The Bacillus multiplies as soon as it has entered the\r\nblood, and the anthrax disease commences. The Bacilli not only give off\r\npoison, but also deprive the blood of its oxygen. Vegetative cells only\r\noccur in living animals. This species is a _facultative parasite_ which\r\nin the first stage is a saprophyte, and only in this condition forms\r\nspores.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 32.--_Anthrax bacillus_ (_Bacillus\r\n  anthracis_) with red (_b_) and white (_a_) blood-corpuscles.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 33.--_Anthrax bacillus._ The formation of the\r\n  spores; magnified 450 times.]\r\n\r\n_Bacillus tuberculosis_ produces tuberculosis in human beings, also\r\nin domestic animals (_perlsucht_). It is a distinct parasite, but may\r\nalso live saprophytically. It is rod-formed, often slightly bent, and\r\nis recognised principally by its action with stains (when stained with\r\nan alkaline solution of methyl-blue or carbolic fuchsin, it retains the\r\ncolour for a long time even in solutions of mineral acids, in contrast\r\nwith the majority of well-known Bacteria): it probably forms spores\r\nwhich are able to resist heat, dryness, etc.\r\n\r\n   _Bacillus lepræ_ produces leprosy; _Bacillus mallei_ produces\r\n   glanders; _Bacillus tetani_, tetanus (the tetanus bacillus\r\n   is very common in soil; anaerobic); _Bacillus diphtheriæ_,\r\n   diphtheria; _Bacillus typhosus_, typhoid fever, etc.\r\n\r\n=Pathogenic Spiral Bacteria.= _Spirochæte obermeieri_ (Fig. 24)\r\nproduces intermittent fever (febris recurrens); it makes its appearance\r\nin the blood during the attacks of fever, but it is not to be found\r\nduring intervals when there is no fever. Obligate parasite.\r\n\r\n_Spirillum choleræ asiaticæ_ (_Microspira comma_) without doubt\r\nproduces Asiatic cholera; an exceedingly motile spirillum, which is\r\nalso found in short, bent rods (known as the “Comma-bacillus”), it\r\nlives in the intestines of those attacked by the disease, and gives off\r\na strong poison which enters the body. It is easily cultivated as a\r\nsaprophyte.\r\n\r\nA great many circumstances seem to show that a number of other\r\ninfectious diseases (syphilis, small-pox, scarlet-fever, measles,\r\nyellow-fever, etc.) owe their origin to parasitic Bacteria, but this\r\nhas not been proved with certainty in all cases.\r\n\r\nIt has been possible by means of special cultivations (ample supply of\r\noxygen, high temperature, antiseptic materials) to produce from the\r\nparasitic Bacteria described above (_e.g._ the fowl-cholera and the\r\nanthrax Bacteria) _physiological varieties_ which are distinct from\r\nthose appearing in nature and possess a less degree of “virulence,”\r\n_i.e._ produce fever and less dangerous symptoms in those animals\r\nwhich are inoculated with them. The production of such physiological\r\nvarieties has come to be of great practical importance from the fact\r\nthat they are used as vaccines, _i.e._ these harmless species produce\r\nin the animals inoculated with them _immunity_ from the malignant\r\ninfectious Bacteria from which they were derived. This immunity is\r\neffected by the change of the products of one or more of the Bacteria,\r\nbut we do not yet know anything about the way in which they act on\r\nthe animal organism. The white blood corpuscles, according to the\r\nMetschnikoff, play the part of “Phagocytes” by absorbing and destroying\r\nthe less virulent Bacteria which have entered the blood, and by so\r\ndoing they are gradually enabled to overcome those of a more virulent\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 34.--_a_ and _b_ The same blood-cell of a\r\n  Frog: _a_ in the act of engulfing an anthrax-bacillus; _b_ after\r\n  an interval of a few minutes when the bacillus has been absorbed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Class 5. =Conjugatæ.=\r\n\r\nThe Algæ belonging to this class have chlorophyll, and pyrenoids\r\nround which starch is formed. The cells divide only in one direction,\r\nthey live solitarily, or united to form filaments which generally\r\nfloat freely (seldom attached). Swarm-cells are wanting. _The\r\nfertilisation is isogamous (conjugation) and takes place by means\r\nof aplanogametes._ The zygote, after a period of rest, produces,\r\nimmediately on germination, one or more new vegetative individuals;\r\nsometimes akinetes or aplanospores are formed in addition. They only\r\noccur in fresh or slightly brackish water.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Desmidiaceæ.= The cells generally present markings on the\r\nouter wall, and are mostly divided into two symmetrical halves by a\r\nconstriction in the middle, or there is at least a symmetrical division\r\nof the protoplasmic cell-contents. The cell-wall consists nearly\r\nalways of two layers, the one overlapping the other (Fig. 35 _C_). The\r\ncells either live solitarily or are united into unbranched filaments.\r\nThe mass of protoplasm formed by the fusion of the two conjugating\r\ncells becomes the zygote, which on germination produces one (or after\r\ndivision 2, 4 or 8) new vegetative individual. The chromatophores are\r\neither star-, plate-, or band-shaped, and regularly arranged round the\r\nlong axis of the cell.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 35.--A Cell of _Gymnozyga brebissonii_,\r\n  external view showing the distribution of the pores. _B A_\r\n  portion of the membrane of _Staurastrum bicorne_ with pores\r\n  containing protoplasmic projections. _C_ Cell-wall of _Hyalotheca\r\n  mucosa_ during cell-division: the central part, being already\r\n  formed, shows the connection with the divisional wall.]\r\n\r\nThe Desmidiaceæ are not able to swim independently, many species,\r\nhowever, show movements of different kinds by rising and sliding\r\nforward on the substratum. These movements, which are partly dependent\r\nupon, and partly independent of light and the force of gravitation, are\r\nconnected with the protrusion of a mucilaginous stalk. The mucilage,\r\nwhich sometimes surrounds the whole individual, may acquire a prismatic\r\nstructure, it is secreted by the protoplasmic threads which project\r\nthrough certain pores definitely situated in the walls (Fig. 35\r\n_A_, _B_).\r\n\r\nVEGETATIVE MULTIPLICATION takes places by division. A good example of\r\nthis is found in _Cosmarium botrytis_ (Fig. 36 _A-D_). The nucleus\r\nand chromatophores divide, and simultaneously the central indentation\r\nbecomes deeper, the outer wall is then ruptured making a circular\r\naperture through which the inner wall protrudes forming a short,\r\ncylindrical canal between the two halves to which it is attached (Fig.\r\n36 _C_). After elongation the canal is divided by a central transverse\r\nwall, which commences as a ring round its inner surface and gradually\r\nforms a complete septum. The dividing wall gradually splits, and the\r\ntwo individuals separate from each other, each one having an old and\r\na new half. The two daughter-cells bulge out, receive a supply of\r\ncontents from the parent-cells, and gradually attain their mature size\r\nand development (Fig. 36 _B-D_). Exceptions to this occur in some forms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 36.--_Cosmarium botrytis. A-D_ Different\r\n  stages of cell-division.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 37.--_Cosmarium meneghinii_: _a-c_ same\r\n  individual seen from the side, from the end, and from the edge;\r\n  _d-f_ stages of conjugation; _g-i_ germination of the zygote.]\r\n\r\nCONJUGATION takes place in the simplest way in _Mesotænium_, where\r\nthe two conjugating cells unite by a short tube (conjugation-canal),\r\nwhich is not developed at any particular point. The aplanogametes\r\nmerge together after the dissolution of the dividing wall, like two\r\ndrops of water, almost without any trace of preceding contraction, so\r\nthat the cell-wall of the zygote generally lies in close contact with\r\nthe conjugating cells. The conjugating cells in the others lie either\r\ntransversely (_e.g. Cosmarium_, Fig. 37 _d_; _Staurastrum_, etc.),\r\nor parallel to one another (_e.g. Penium_, _Closterium_, etc.), and\r\nemit a short conjugation-canal (Fig. 37 _d_) from the centre of that\r\nside of each cell which is turned towards the other one. These canals\r\ntouch, become spherical, and on the absorption of the dividing wall\r\nthe aplanogametes coalesce in the swollen conjugation-canal (Fig.\r\n37 _e_), which is often surrounded by a mucilaginous envelope. The\r\nzygote, which is often spherical, is surrounded by a thick cell-wall,\r\nconsisting of three layers; the outermost of these sometimes bears\r\nthorn-like projections, which in some species are simple (Fig. 37\r\n_f_), in others branched or variously marked; in some, however, it\r\nremains always smooth (_e.g._ _Tetmemorus_, _Desmidium_). Deviation\r\nfrom this mode of conjugation may occur within certain genera (_e.g._\r\n_Closterium_, _Penium_). Upon germination the contents of the zygote\r\nemerge, surrounded by the innermost layers of the wall (Fig. 37 _g_,\r\n_h_) and generally divide into two parts which develop into two new\r\nindividuals, placed transversely to each other (Fig. 37 _i_); these may\r\nhave a somewhat more simple marking than is generally possessed by the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 38.--Desmidiaceæ. _A Closterium\r\n  moniliferum_; _B Penium crassiusculum_; _C Micrasterias\r\n  truncata_ (front and end view); _D Euastrum elegans_; _E_\r\n  _Staurastrum muticum_ (end view).]\r\n\r\n   The most frequent genera are:--\r\n\r\n   _A._ Solitary cells: MESOTÆNIUM, PENIUM (Fig. 38 _B_),\r\n   CYLINDROCYSTIS, EUASTRUM (Fig. 38 _D_), MICRASTERIAS (Fig. 38\r\n   _C_), COSMARIUM (Fig. 36, 37), XANTHIDIUM, STAURASTRUM (Fig. 38\r\n   _E_), PLEUROTÆNIUM, DOCIDIUM, TETMEMORUS, CLOSTERIUM (Fig. 38\r\n   _A_), SPIROTÆNIA.\r\n\r\n   _B._ Cells united into filaments: SPHÆROZOSMA, DESMIDIUM,\r\n   HYALOTHECA, GYMNOZYGA, ANCYLONEMA, GONATOZYGON.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Zygnemaceæ.= Cell-wall without markings. The cells are\r\ncylindrical, not constricted in the centre, and (generally) united into\r\nsimple, unbranched filaments. The whole contents of the conjugating\r\ncells take part in the formation of the zygote, which on germination\r\ngrows out directly into a new filament.\r\n\r\n_Spirogyra_ is easily recognised by its spiral chlorophyll band;\r\n_Zygnema_ has two star-like chromatophores in each cell (Fig. 40);\r\nboth these genera are very common Algæ in ponds and ditches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 39.--_Spirogyra longata. A_ At the\r\n  commencement of conjugation, the conjugation-canals begin\r\n  to protrude at _a_ and touch one another at _b_; the spiral\r\n  chlorophyll band and cell-nuclei (_k_) are shown. _B_ A more\r\n  advanced stage of conjugation; _a_, _a’_ the rounded female and\r\n  male aplanogametes: in _b’_ the male aplanogamete is going over\r\n  to and uniting with the female aplanogamete (_b_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 40.--A cell of _Zygnema_. _S_ Pyrenoid.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 41.--_Zygnema insigne_, with zygote.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 42.--Germinating zygote of _Spirogyra\r\n  jugalis_: the young plant is still unicellular; the end which is\r\n  still in the wall of the zygote is elongated and root-like; the\r\n  chromatophore divides and forms the spiral band.]\r\n\r\nThe conjugation among the Zygnemaceæ takes place in the following\r\nmanner: the cells of two filaments, lying side by side, or two cells,\r\nthe one being situated above the other in the same filament (Fig. 41),\r\npush out small protuberances opposite each other (Fig. 39 _A_, _a_,\r\n_b_); these finally meet, and the dividing wall is absorbed so that a\r\ntube is formed connecting one cell with the other; the protoplasmic\r\ncontents round off, and the whole of these contents of one of the\r\ncells glides through the conjugation-tube and coalesces with that of\r\nthe other (Fig. 39 _B_), the aggregate mass then rounds off, surrounds\r\nitself with a cell-wall, and becomes a zygote. A distinct difference\r\nmay be found between the cells in the two filaments, those in the one\r\nwhose protoplasmic contents pass over being cylindrical, while those\r\nof the recipient one are more barrel-shaped, and of a larger diameter.\r\nThe former may be regarded as a male, the latter as a female plant.\r\nThe zygote germinates after a period of rest, and grows out into a new\r\nfilament (Fig. 42).\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Mesocarpaceæ.= The cell-walls are glabrous, unconstricted\r\nin the centre, and united into simple unbranched filaments. The\r\nchromatophore consists of an axial chlorophyll-plate, with several\r\npyrenoids. The zygote is formed by the coalescence of two cells (Fig.\r\n43) (sometimes three or four), but the whole protoplasmic contents of\r\nthe cells do not take part in this process, a portion always remaining\r\nbehind; the aplanogametes coalesce in the conjugation-canal. The\r\nzygote thus formed appears incapable of germination until after 3–5\r\ndivisions. Of the cells so formed, only one is fertile, the sterile\r\ncells, according to Pringsheim, constituting a rudimentary sporocarp.\r\nThe germinating cells grow out into a new filament. In this order,\r\nconjugation has been observed between two cells of the same filament.\r\nThe Mesocarpaceæ thrive best in water which contains lime.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Mougeotia calcarea. Cells showing\r\n  various modes of conjugation: at _m_ tripartition; _pg_\r\n  quadripartition; _s_ quinquipartilion of the zygote.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Class 6. =Chlorophyceæ (Green Algæ).=\r\n\r\nThese Algæ are coloured green by chlorophyll, seldom in combination\r\nwith other colouring matter, and then especially with red. The product\r\nof assimilation is frequently starch, which generally accumulates round\r\ncertain specially formed portions of protoplasm termed pyrenoids.\r\nThe thallus is uni- or multicellular; in the higher forms (certain\r\nSiphoneæ) the organs of vegetation attain differentiation into stem\r\nand leaf. The asexual reproduction takes place in various ways; the\r\nsexual reproduction is effected by conjugation of motile gametes, or\r\nby oogamous fertilisation. The swarm-cells (zoospores, gametes, and\r\nspermatozoids) are constructed symetrically, and have true protoplasmic\r\ncilia, these generally being attached to the front end of the\r\nswarm-cells. Most of these Algæ live in water (fresh or salt); some are\r\nfound upon damp soil, stones, or tree-stems, and some live enclosed in\r\nother plants.\r\n\r\nThe Class is divided into three families:--\r\n\r\n1. PROTOCOCCOIDEÆ: Volvocaceæ, Tetrasporaceæ, Chlorosphæraceæ,\r\nPleurococcaceæ, Protococcaceæ, Hydrodictyaceæ.\r\n\r\n2. CONFERVOIDEÆ: Ulvaceæ, Ulothricaceæ, Chætophoraceæ, Mycoideaceæ,\r\nCylindrocapsaceæ, Œdogoniaceæ, Coleochætaceæ, Cladophoraceæ,\r\nGomontiaceæ, Sphæropleaceæ.\r\n\r\n3. SIPHONEÆ: Botrydiaceæ, Bryopsidaceæ, Derbesiaceæ, Vaucheriaceæ,\r\nPhyllosiphonaceæ, Caulerpaceæ, Codiaceæ, Valoniaceæ, Dasycladaceæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 1. =Protococcoideæ.=\r\n\r\nThe Algæ which belong to this group are uni- or multicellular with\r\nthe cells more or less firmly connected, sometimes in a definite,\r\nsometimes in an indefinite form (Fig. 47). Colonies are formed either\r\nby division or by small unicellular individuals becoming united in a\r\ndefinite manner; the colonies formed in this latter way are termed\r\n_Cœnobia_. Apical cells and branching are absent. Multiplication\r\nby division; asexual reproduction by zoospores, rarely by akinetes.\r\nSexual reproduction may be wanting, or it takes place by isogamous,\r\nrarely by oogamous fertilisation.\r\n\r\nSome are attached by means of a stalk to other objects (_Characium_,\r\nFig. 49), others occur as “Endophytes” in the tissues of certain Mosses\r\nor Phanerogams, _e.g. Chlorochytrium lemnæ_, in _Lemna trisulca_;\r\n_Endosphæra_, in the leaves of _Potamogeton_, _Mentha aquatica_,\r\nand _Peplis portula_; _Phyllobium_, in the leaves of _Lysimachia\r\nnummularia_, _Ajuga_, _Chlora_, and species of Grasses; _Scotinosphæra_\r\nin the leaves of _Hypnum_ and _Lemna trisulca_; the majority, however,\r\nlive free in water and in damp places. Many species which were formerly\r\nconsidered to belong to this family have been proved to be higher Algæ\r\nin stages of development.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Volvocaceæ.= The individuals in this order are either\r\nuni- or multicellular, and during the essential part of their life are\r\nfree-swimming organisms. They are generally encased in a mucilaginous\r\nenvelope, through which 2–6 cilia project from every cell. The\r\nvegetative reproduction takes place by the division of all, or a few,\r\nof the cells of the individual; in some a palmella-stage is found in\r\naddition. The sexual reproduction takes place by isogamous or oogamous\r\nfertilisation.\r\n\r\n   The Volvocaceæ may be considered to include the original forms\r\n   of the Chlorophyceæ, because, among other reasons, the motile\r\n   stage is here the most prominent; they also form the connecting\r\n   link between the animal Flagellata, and forms intermediate to\r\n   the _Syngeneticæ_ may perhaps be found amongst them. Three\r\n   series of green Algæ may be supposed to have taken their origin\r\n   from the Volvocaceæ: CONJUGATEÆ (_Desmidiaceæ_) which have lost\r\n   the swarming stage, but whose conjugation is the nearest to the\r\n   fertilisation in _Chlamydomonas pulvisculus_: the PROTOCOCCACEÆ\r\n   in which the vegetative divisions have disappeared, while the\r\n   swarming stage continues to be present, though of shorter\r\n   duration; and TETRASPORACEÆ, in which the vegetative divisions\r\n   are more prominent, whilst the swarming stage is less so.\r\n\r\nA. UNICELLULAR INDIVIDUALS. The principle genera are: _Chlamydomonas_,\r\n_Sphærella_, _Phacotus_.--_Sphærella nivalis_ is the Alga which\r\nproduces the phenomenon of “Red Snow,” well known on high mountains and\r\non ice and snow fields in the polar regions. The red colouring matter\r\nwhich appears in this and other green Algæ, especially in the resting\r\ncells, is produced by the alteration of the chlorophyll.\r\n\r\n_Phacotus lenticularis_ has an outer covering incrusted with lime,\r\nwhich, at death, or after division, opens out into two halves.\r\nSpecies may be found among _Chlamydomonas_, in which conjugation\r\ntakes place between gametes of similar size without cell-wall, but\r\nin _C. pulvisculus_ conjugation takes place between male and female\r\naplanogametes which are surrounded by a mucilaginous envelope.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 44--_Gonium pectorale._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 45.--_Pandorina morum._]\r\n\r\nB. MULTICELLULAR INDIVIDUALS. The most important genera are _Gonium_,\r\n_Stephanosphæra_, _Pandorina_, _Eudorina_, _Volvox_.--_Gonium_ has 4\r\nor 16 cells arranged in a definite pattern in a flat plate (Fig. 44).\r\n_Pandorina_ (Fig. 45), has 16 cells arranged in a sphere (Fig. 45 _A_).\r\nThe vegetative reproduction takes place in this way: each cell, after\r\nhaving rounded off, and after the withdrawal of the cilia, divides\r\nitself into 16 new ones (Fig. 45 _B_), each forming a new individual,\r\nwhich soon grows to the size of the mother-individual. It was in this\r\nAlga that the conjugation of self-motile gametes was first discovered\r\nby Pringsheim, 1869. When conjugation is about to take place, each\r\ncell divides into sixteen, as in vegetative reproduction, but the 16\r\n× 16 cells all separate from one another (Fig. 45 _C_, female gametes,\r\nand _D_, male gametes), and swarm solitarily in the water. The male\r\nare, most frequently, smaller than the female, but otherwise they are\r\nexactly alike; they are more or less pear-shaped, with a colourless\r\nanterior end, 2 cilia, a red “eye-spot,” etc. After swarming for some\r\ntime they approach each other, two and two, generally a large and a\r\nsmaller one, and come into contact at their colourless end; in a few\r\nmoments they coalesce and become one cell (Fig. 45 _E_, _F_), this has\r\nat first a large colourless anterior end, 4 cilia, and 2 “eye-spots”\r\n(Fig. 45 _G_), but these soon disappear and the cell becomes uniformly\r\ndark-green and spherical, and surrounds itself with a thick cell-wall,\r\nlosing at the same time its power of motion: the zygote (Fig. 45 _H_)\r\nis formed, and becomes later on a deep red colour. On the germination\r\nof the zygote, the protoplasmic cell-contents burst open the wall (Fig.\r\n45 _J_), and emerge as a large swarmspore (Fig. 45 _K_) which divides\r\ninto 16 cells, and the first small individual is formed (Fig. 45 _L_,\r\n_M_).\r\n\r\n_Eudorina_ is like _Pandorina_ in structure, but stands somewhat\r\nhigher, since the contrast between the conjugating sexual cells is\r\ngreater, the female one being a motionless oosphere.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 46.--_Volvox globator_, sexual individual:\r\n  _a_ antheridia which have formed spermatozoids; _b_ oogonia.]\r\n\r\nThe highest stage of development is found in _Volvox_ (Fig. 46). The\r\ncells are here arranged on the circumference of a sphere, and enclose\r\na cavity filled with mucilage. The number of these cells may vary from\r\n200–22,000, of which the majority are vegetative and not reproductive,\r\nbut some become large, motionless oospheres (Fig. 46 _b_); others,\r\nwhich may appear as solitary individuals, divide and form disc-shaped\r\nmasses of from 8–256 small spermatozoids (Fig. 46 _a_). After the\r\noosphere has been fertilised by these, the oospore surrounds itself by\r\na thick, sometimes thorny cell-wall, and on germination becomes a new\r\nindividual of few cells. A few cells conspicuous by their larger size\r\nmay be found (1–9, but generally 8) in certain individuals, and these\r\nprovide the vegetative reproduction, each forming by division a new\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Tetrasporaceæ= reproduce both by vegetative divisions and\r\nswarmspores, some have also gamete-conjugation. The principal genera\r\nare: _Tetraspora_, _Apiocystis_, _Dactylococcus_, _Dictyosphærium_,\r\n_Chlorangium_.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Chlorosphæraceæ.= _Chlorosphæra._\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Pleurococcaceæ.= In this order the swarm-stages and sexual\r\nreproduction are entirely absent. Vegetative reproduction by division.\r\nThe principal genera are: _Pleurococcus_ (Fig. 47), _Scenedesmus_\r\n(Fig. 48), _Raphidium_, _Oocystis_, _Schizochlamys_, _Crucigenia_,\r\n_Selenastrum_.--_Pleurococcus vulgaris_ (Fig. 47) is one of the\r\nmost common Algæ throughout the world, occurring as green coverings\r\non tree-stems, and damp walls, and it is one of the most common\r\nlichen-gonidia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 47.--_Pleurococcus vulgaris._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 48.--_Scenedesmus quadricauda._]\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Protococcaceæ.= The cells are motionless, free or affixed\r\non a stalk (_e.g. Characium_, Fig. 49), either separate or loosely\r\nbound to one another; they never form multicellular individuals.\r\nMultiplication by division is nearly always wanting. Reproduction\r\ntakes place by swarmspores, which have 1 or 2 cilia, and sexual\r\nreproduction in some by gamete-conjugation. The principal genera are:\r\n_Chlorococcum_, _Chlorochytrium_, _Chlorocystis_, _Scotinosphæra_,\r\n_Endosphæra_, _Phyllobium_, _Characium_, _Ophiocytium_, _Sciadium_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 49.--_Characium strictum._\r\n  _A_ The cell-contents have divided into many swarmspores.\r\n  _B_ Swarmspores escaping.]\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Hydrodictyaceæ.= The individuals are unicellular but\r\nseveral unite after the zoospore-stage into definitely formed families\r\n(cœnobia). Ordinary vegetative division is wanting, but asexual\r\nreproduction takes place by zoospores (or by motionless cells without\r\ncilia), which unite and form a family similar to the mother-family,\r\ninside the mother-cell, or in a mucilaginous envelope. Where sexual\r\nreproduction is found it takes place by gamete-conjugation. The\r\nprincipal genera are: _Pediastrum_ (Fig. 50), _Cœlastrum_,\r\n_Hydrodictyon_ (Fig. 51).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5O.--_Pediastrum asperum._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 51.--_Hydrodictyou reticulatum. A_ A cell\r\n  where the zoospores are on the point of arranging themselves to\r\n  form a net. _B_ A cell with gametes swarming out.]\r\n\r\nThe cœnobium of _Hydrodictyon reticulatum_ (Water-net) is formed of\r\na large number of cells which are cylindrical, and attached to one\r\nanother by the ends (Fig. 51). The asexual reproduction takes place by\r\nzoospores, which are formed in large numbers (7,000–20,000) in each\r\nmother-cell, within which they move about for a time, and then come\r\nto rest and arrange themselves into a new net (Fig. 51 _A_) which is\r\nset free by the dissolution of the wall of the mother-cell, grows,\r\nand becomes a new cœnobium. The sexual reproduction takes place by\r\ngamete-conjugation. The gametes are formed in the same manner as the\r\nzoospores, but in larger numbers (30,000–100,000), and swarm out of the\r\nmother-cell (Fig. 51 _B_). The zygote forms, on germination, 2–5 large\r\nzoospores, each with one or two cilia, these generally swarm about\r\nfor a time, and after a period of rest become irregular thorny bodies\r\n(polyhedra); their contents again divide into zoospores, the thorny\r\nexternal coating of the polyhedra is cast off, and the zoospores,\r\nsurrounded by the dilated internal coating, unite to form a small\r\nfamily, which produces several others in the manner described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 2. =Confervoideæ.=\r\n\r\nThe individuals are always multicellular, the cells firmly bound\r\ntogether and united into unbranched or branched filaments, expansions,\r\nor masses of cells which grow by intercallary divisions or have\r\napical growth. In the first seven orders the cells are uninuclear,\r\nbut the cells of the remaining three orders contain several nuclei.\r\nAsexual reproduction by zoospores, akinetes or aplanospores. Sexual\r\nreproduction by isogamous or oogamous fertilisation.\r\n\r\n   The Confervoideæ, through the Ulvaceæ, are connected with the\r\n   Tetrasporaceæ, and from the _Coleochætaceæ_, which is the most\r\n   highly developed order, there are the best reasons for supposing\r\n   that the Mosses have taken their origin. The _Cladophoraceæ_\r\n   show the nearest approach to the _Siphoneæ_.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Ulvaceæ.= The thallus consists of one or two layers of\r\nparenchymatous cells, connected together to form either a flat membrane\r\n(_Monostroma_, _Ulva_) or a hollow tube (_Enteromorpha_), and may be\r\neither simple, lobed, or branched. Reproduction takes place by detached\r\nportions of the thallus; or asexually by zoospores or akinetes.\r\nGamete-conjugation is known to take place in some members of this\r\norder, the zygote germinating without any resting-stage. The majority\r\nare found in salt or brackish water.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 52.--_Ulothrix zonata_: a portion of a\r\n  filament with zoospores, which are formed two in each cell\r\n  (zoosporangium); the dark spots are the red “eye-spots”; 1,\r\n  2, 3, 4, denote successive stages in the development of the\r\n  zoospores; _b_ a single zoospore, _v_ the pulsating vacuole;\r\n  _c_ portion of a filament with gametes, sixteen are produced in\r\n  each gametangium; _d_ free gametes, solitary or in the act of\r\n  conjugation; _e_ the conjugation is completed, and the formed\r\n  zygote has assumed the resting-stage.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Ulothricaceæ.= The thallus consists normally of a simple\r\nunbranched filament (sometimes a small expansion consisting of one\r\nlayer of cells is formed, as in _Schizomeris_ and _Prasiola_ which\r\nwere formerly described as separate genera). Asexual reproduction\r\ntakes place by means of zoospores (with 1, 2, or 4 cilia), akinetes\r\nor aplanospores; the last named may germinate immediately, or only\r\nafter a period of rest. Sexual reproduction takes place by the\r\nconjugation of gametes of about the same size, each having two cilia\r\n(Fig. 52 _d_). The zygote of _Ulothrix_, on germination, produces a\r\nbrood of zoospores which swarm for a time and then elongate to become\r\n_Ulothrix_-filaments (alternation of generations). The gametes may also\r\ngerminate without conjugation in the same manner as the zoospores.\r\nThe principal genera are: _Ulothrix_, _Hormidium_, _Conferva_,\r\n_Microspora_.--_Ulothrix zonata_ is very common in running fresh water.\r\nNearly all the species of _Hormidium_ occur on damp soil, tree-stems\r\nand stones.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Chætophoraceæ.= The thallus consists of a single, branched,\r\nerect or creeping filament of cells, often surrounded by mucilage.\r\nThe cells have only one nucleus. Asexual reproduction by zoospores\r\nwith 2 or 4 cilia, by akinetes, or aplanospores. In many, conjugation\r\nbetween gametes with 2 cilia may be found. They approach on one side,\r\nUlothricaceæ, and on the other, Mycoideaceæ. The principal genera\r\nare: _Stigeoclonium_, _Draparnaldia_, _Chætophora_, _Entoderma_,\r\n_Aphanochæte_, _Herposteiron_, _Phæothamnion_, _Chlorotylium_,\r\n_Trichophilus_, _Gongrosira_, _Trentepohlia_. Most of the species of\r\n_Trentepohlia_ are coloured red by the presence of a red colouring\r\nmaterial, which occurs in addition to the chlorophyll. They are aerial\r\nAlgæ which live on stones (_T. jolithus_, “violet stone,” so named\r\non account of its violet-like odour in rainy weather), on bark and\r\nold wood (_T. umbrina_), or on damp rocks (_T. aurea_). _Trichophilus\r\nwelckeri_ lives in the hair of Bradypus.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Mycoideaceæ.= The thallus is discoid, consisting of one or\r\nmore cell-layers, and is always attached. Asexual reproduction by\r\nzoospores with 2 or 4 cilia. Sexual reproduction in some species by the\r\nconjugation of gametes with 2 cilia. This order forms the connecting\r\nlink between _Chætophoraceæ_ and _Coleochætaceæ_. The species occur in\r\nfresh water (_Chætopeltis_) as well as in salt (_Pringsheimia_), on the\r\ncarapace of tortoises (_Dermatophyton_ = _Epiclemmydia_), or endophytic\r\nbetween the cuticle and the epidermal cells of the leaves of tropical\r\nplants, destroying the leaf-tissue (_Mycoidea_).\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Cylindrocapsaceæ.= The thallus consists of a simple (rarely,\r\nin parts, formed of many rows) unbranched filament, attached in the\r\nyoung condition, which has short cells with a single nucleus, and is\r\nenveloped in a thick envelope with a laminated structure. Asexual\r\nreproduction by zoospores with 2 cilia, which are formed 1, 2, or 4 in\r\neach vegetative cell. The antheridia are produced by a single cell,\r\nor a group of cells, in a filament, dividing several times without\r\nincreasing in size. Two egg-shaped spermatozoids, each with 2 cilia\r\n(Fig. 53 _D_), are formed in each antheridium, and escape through\r\nan aperture in the side; in the first stages they are enclosed in a\r\nbladder-like membrane (Fig. 53 _B_, _C_). Other cells of the filament\r\nswell out and form oogonia (Fig. 53 _A_), which resemble those of\r\n_Œdogonium_. After fertilisation, the oospore surrounds itself with a\r\nthick wall, and assumes a reddish colour. The germination is unknown.\r\nThe unfertilised oospheres remain green, divide often into 2–4\r\ndaughter-cells, and grow into new filaments.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 53.--_Cylindrocopsa involuta. A_ Oogonium\r\n  with oosphere (_o_) surrounded by spermatozoids (_s_). _B_ Two\r\n  antheridia, each with two spermatozoids. _C_ Spermatozoids\r\n  surrounded by their bladder-like membrane. _D_ Free spermatozoid.]\r\n\r\nThis order, which only includes one genus, _Cylindrocapsa_, forms the\r\nconnecting link between _Ulothricaceæ_ and _Œdogoniaceæ_. The few\r\nspecies (4) occur only in fresh water.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Œdogoniaceæ.= The thallus consists of branched (_Bulbochæte_)\r\nor unbranched (_Œdogonium_) filaments, attached in the early stages.\r\nThe cells may be longer or shorter, and have one nucleus. Asexual\r\nreproduction by zoospores, which have a chaplet of cilia round the base\r\nof the colourless end (Fig. 6 _a_). Sexual reproduction takes place by\r\noogamous fertilisation. On the germination of the oospore, 4 zoospores\r\nare formed (Fig. 54 _F_). They occur only in fresh or slightly brackish\r\nwater. The division of the cells takes place in quite a peculiar and\r\nunusual manner. At the upper end of the cell which is about to divide,\r\na ring-shaped thickening of soft cellulose is formed transversely round\r\nthe wall; the cell-nucleus of the mother-cell and the protoplasm then\r\ndivide by a transverse wall into two portions of similar size, and the\r\ncell-wall bursts transversely along the central line of the thickened\r\nring. The cell-wall thus divides into two parts--the upper one short,\r\nthe “cap,” and the lower one much longer, the “sheath.” The portions\r\nof the original cell-wall now separate from each other, the cellulose\r\nring extending, and supplying an additional length of cell-wall between\r\nthem. The cap and sheath will project a little in front of the piece\r\nthus inserted. The dividing wall between the two new cells is formed\r\nnear to the uppermost edge of the sheath, and gradually becomes thicker\r\nand firmer. The inserted piece of wall forms the larger part of the\r\nwall of the upper cell: the remainder is formed by the cap. This mode\r\nof division is repeated exactly in the same way, and new caps are\r\nformed close below the first one, one for every division.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 54.--_A Œdogonium ciliatum. A_ Female\r\n  plant with three oogonia (_og_) and dwarf-males (_m_). _B_ An\r\n  oogonium with spermatozoid (_z_) seen entering the oosphere\r\n  (_o_) having passed through an aperture near the summit of the\r\n  oogonium; _m_ dwarf-male. _C_ Ripe oospore. _D Œdogonium\r\n  gemelliparum. F_ Portion of a male filament from which\r\n  spermatozoids (_z_) are emerging. _E_ Portion of filament of\r\n  _Bulbochæte_; the upper oogonium still encloses the oospore, in\r\n  the central one the oospore is escaping while the lower one is\r\n  empty. _F_ Four zoospores developed from an oospore. _G_ Zoospore\r\n  germinating.]\r\n\r\nFertilisation takes place in the following way. The oogonium is a\r\nlarge ellipsoidal, swollen cell (_og_, in Fig. 54 _A_), whose contents\r\nare rounded off into an oosphere with a colourless receptive-spot\r\n(see _B_); an aperture is formed in the wall of the oogonium, through\r\nwhich the spermatozoids are enabled to enter (_B_). The spermatozoids\r\nare produced either directly, as in _D_ (in pairs), in basal cells\r\nof the filament, or indirectly. In the latter case a swarmspore\r\n(_androspore_) is formed which comes to rest, attaches itself to an\r\noogonium, germinates, and gives rise to a filament of a very few\r\ncells--_dwarf-male_ (_A_, _B_, _m_). The spermatozoids are formed in\r\nthe upper cell of the dwarf-male (_m_), and are set free by the summit\r\nof the antheridium lifting off like a lid. On the germination of the\r\noospore (_C_), which takes place in the following spring, 4 zoospores\r\nare produced (_F_) (_i.e._ the sexual generation); these swarm about\r\nfor a time, and ultimately grow into new filaments.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 55.--_Coleochæte pulvinata. A_ A portion\r\n  of a thallus with organs of reproduction; _a_ oogonium before,\r\n  _b_ after fertilisation; _c_ an antheridium, closed; _d_ open,\r\n  with emerging spermatozoid. _B_ Ripe oogonium, with envelope. _C_\r\n  Germination of the oospore. _D_ Zoospore. _E_ Spermatozoid.]\r\n\r\nOrder 7. =Coleochætaceæ.= The thallus is always attached, and of a\r\ndisc- or cushion-shape, formed by the dichotomous branching of filaments\r\nof cells united in a pseudo-parenchymatous manner. Each cell has only\r\none nucleus. Asexual reproduction by zoospores with 2 cilia (Fig. 55\r\n_D_), which may arise in all the cells. Sexual reproduction by oogamous\r\nfertilisation. The spermatozoids resemble the swarmspores, but are\r\nsmaller (_E_), and originate singly (in the species figured) in small\r\nconical cells (_c_, _d_ in _A_). The oogonia are developed at the\r\nextremities of certain branches: they are bottle-shaped cells with very\r\nlong and thin necks (_trichogyne_), open at the end (_a_ in _A_); at\r\nthe base of each oogonium is a spherical oosphere. The spermatozoids\r\nreach the oosphere through the trichogyne, or through an aperture in\r\nthe wall when the trichogyne is absent, and fertilisation having taken\r\nplace, the oogonium becomes surrounded by a cell-layer (envelope),\r\nwhich grows out from the cells near its base (_b_ in _A_), and in this\r\nway a kind of fruit is formed (_B_) (_spermocarp_, _cystocarp_).\r\n\r\nThe oospore, next spring, divides and forms a parenchymatous tissue\r\n(homologous with the Moss-sporophyte); this bursts open the envelope\r\n(_C_), and a zoospore (homologous with the spores of the Moss-capsule)\r\narises in each of the cells, and produces a new _Coleochæte_. We have\r\nthen, in this case, a still more distinct alternation of generations\r\nthan in _Œdogonium_. Only one genus, _Coleochæte_, is known, but it\r\ncontains several species, all living in fresh water.\r\n\r\nOrder 8. =Cladophoraceæ.= This order is probably derived from the\r\nUlothricaceæ. The thallus consists of a single, unbranched or branched\r\nfilament, generally with an apical cell. The cells have each 2 or more\r\nnuclei. Asexual reproduction by zoospores with 2 or 4 cilia, and by\r\nakinetes. Conjugation of gametes with 2 cilia is found in some genera.\r\nThey occur in salt as well as in fresh water. The principal genera are:\r\n_Urospora_, _Chætomorpha_, _Rhizoclonium_, _Cladophora_; of the last\r\nnamed genus the species _C. lanosa_ and _C. rupestris_ are common in\r\nsalt water; _C. fracta_ and _C. glomerata_ in fresh water.\r\n\r\nOrder 9. =Gomontiaceæ.= _Gomontia polyrrhiza_, the only species\r\nhitherto known, is found on old calcareous shells of certain salt water\r\nMolluscs.\r\n\r\nOrder 10. =Sphæropleaceæ.= The thallus consists of free, unbranched\r\nfilaments, with very elongated multinuclear cells. The vegetative\r\ncells form no zoospores. Sexual reproduction by oogamous fertilisation\r\n(see page 13, Fig. 10 _B_). The oospore has a thick wall (Fig. 10\r\n_D_) studded with warts, and assumes a colour resembling red lead. It\r\ngerminates only in the following spring, and produces 1–8 zoospores,\r\neach with 2 cilia (Fig. 10 _E_), which grow into new filaments. Only\r\none species, _Sphæroplea annulina_, is known.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Family 3. Siphoneæ.\r\n\r\nThe thallus has apical growth, and in the vegetative condition consists\r\ngenerally of one single (in the Valoniaceæ most frequently of more)\r\nmultinuclear cell, which may be much branched, and whose separate parts\r\nin the higher forms (_e.g. Bryopsis_, Fig. 57; _Caulerpa_, Fig.\r\n59, etc.) may be differentiated to perform the various physiological\r\nfunctions (as root, stem and leaf). Vegetative multiplication by\r\ndetached portions of the thallus (gemmæ); asexual reproduction\r\nby zoospores, akinetes, or aplanospores. Sexual reproduction by\r\ngamete-conjugation, rarely by oogamous fertilisation. The zygote or\r\noospore germinates as a rule without any resting-stage.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 56.--_Botrydium granulatum_: _a_ an entire\r\n  plant forming swarmspores; _b_ swamspores; _c_ an individual with\r\n  gametangia; _d_, gamete; _e_, _f_, _g_ conjugation; _h_ zygote\r\n  seen from above; _i_ the same in a lateral view.]\r\n\r\nMost of the Siphoneæ occur in salt water or on damp soil. Many (_e.g._\r\n_Dasycladaceæ_) are very much incrusted with lime, and occur, in the\r\nfossilized condition, in the deposits from the Cretaceous period to\r\nthe present time. The Siphoneæ are connected by their lowest forms\r\n(_Botrydiaceæ_ or _Valonia_) with the Protococcaceæ, but show also,\r\nthrough the Valoniaceæ, points of relationship to the _Cladophoraceæ_.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Botrydiaceæ.= The thallus in the vegetative condition\r\nis unicellular, club-shaped, with a small single (_Codiolum_) or\r\nrepeatedly dichotomously branched system of colourless rhizoids\r\n(_Botrydium_, Fig. 56 _a_), by which it is attached to objects immersed\r\nin salt water (_Codiolum_) or to damp clay soil (_Botrydium_). Asexual\r\nreproduction by zoospores with one (_Botrydium_) or two cilia, and by\r\naplanospores. The sexual reproduction is only known in _Botrydium_, and\r\ntakes place in the following manner: in the part of the thallus which\r\nis above ground and in an active vegetative condition, several round\r\ncells (Fig. 56 _c_) are formed, which may be green or red according as\r\nthey grow under water, or exposed to the strong light of the sun. These\r\ncells must be considered as “gametangia” as they produce many gametes\r\n(_d_) provided with two cilia. The zygote (_h_, _i_) formed by the\r\nconjugation (_e_, _f_, _g_) may either germinate immediately, or become\r\na thick-walled resting-cell of an irregular, angular form.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Bryopsidaceæ.= The thallus in the vegetative condition\r\n   is unicellular, and consists at the lower extremity of branched\r\n   rhizoids, while the upper portion is prolonged into a stem-like\r\n   structure of unlimited growth, producing, acropetally, branches\r\n   and leaf-like structures. The latter have limited growth,\r\n   and are separated by a cross wall from the stem, and become\r\n   gametangia, or drop off. The gametes have two cilia, and are of\r\n   two kinds: the female, which are green and large and the male,\r\n   which are of brownish colour and smaller. Zoospores or any other\r\n   method of asexual reproduction are unknown. Only one genus,\r\n   _Bryopsis_, living in salt water.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 57.--_Bryopsis plumosa_. A the plant, natural\r\n  size. B A portion (enlarged) which shows the growing point (v),\r\n  and the leaves derived from it in acropetal succession.]\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Derbesiaceæ.= Only one genus, _Derbesia_, living in\r\n   saltwater. The zoospores, which are formed in a few lateral,\r\n   swollen zoosporangia, possess one nucleus which has arisen\r\n   through the coalescence of several, and they resemble the\r\n   zoospores of _Œdogonium_ by having a circle of cilia attached at\r\n   the base of the colourless spot.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Vaucheriaceæ.= The thallus consists, in the vegetative\r\ncondition, of a single irregularly or dichotomously branched cell,\r\nwithout differentiation into stem or leaf; root-like organs of\r\nattachment may however occur. Asexual reproduction by zoospores, which\r\nare formed singly in the extremity of a branch cut off by a transverse\r\nwall. They contain many nuclei, and bear small cilia situated in\r\npairs, which give the appearance of a fine “pile” covering the whole\r\nor a great part of the surface. Akinetes, aplanospores, and phytoamœbæ\r\n(naked masses of protoplasm, without cilia, which creep like an amœba\r\non a substratum) may occur under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThe sexual reproductive organs are formed on short lateral branches,\r\nand are separated from the vegetative cell (Fig. 58 _A_) by cell-walls.\r\nNumerous spermatozoids, each with two cilia, are developed in the\r\ncoiled antheridium (_A_, _b_). The oogonium is a thick, egg-shaped,\r\noften oblique cell, with its protoplasm rounded into an oosphere,\r\nwhich has a hyaline “receptive-spot” (_A_, _a_) immediately beneath\r\nthe aperture formed in the wall of the oogonium. A slimy mass, which\r\nserves to receive the spermatozoids, is formed in some species in this\r\naperture. The spermatozoids when liberated swim towards and enter\r\nthe oosphere, which then immediately surrounds itself with a thick\r\ncell-wall. The mature oospore (_B_) contains a large quantity of oil.\r\nAt germination the outer cell-wall bursts and a new plant is formed.\r\nThere is only one genus, _Vaucheria_, with species living in salt as\r\nwell as in fresh water and on damp soil.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 58.--_Vaucheria sessilis_. _A_ Fertilisation;\r\n  _b_ the antheridia; _a_ the oogonia; _a_ the receptive spot. _B_\r\n  Oospore.]\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Phyllosiphonaceæ= are parasites in the leaves and stalks of\r\nFlowering-plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Caulerpaceæ.= The thallus has distinct differentiation into\r\nroot, stem and leaf-like members (Fig. 59); it is unicellular. Within\r\nthe cell, strong, branched threads of cellulose extend from one side\r\nto the other serving as stays to support the thallus. Reproduction\r\ntakes place by detached portions of the thallus; no other modes of\r\nreproduction are known. This order may most approximately be classed\r\nwith the _Bryopsidaceæ_. The genus _Caulerpa_ consists of more than\r\nseventy species which inhabit the tropical seas.\r\n\r\nOrder 7. =Codiaceæ.= The thallus has various forms, but without\r\ndistinct differentiation in stem- or leaf-structures, sometimes (_e.g._\r\n_Halimeda_) it is very much incrusted with lime. In the early stages\r\nit is unicellular (later, often multicellular), very much branched,\r\nwith the branches, at any rate partly, so united or grown in amongst\r\none another (Fig. 60) that an apparently parenchymatous cellular\r\nbody is formed. Akinetes or aplanospores are wanting; zoospores (or\r\ngametes?) may be developed in some species, however, in special swollen\r\nsporangia. Fertilisation similar to that in _Bryopsis_ occurs perhaps\r\nin _Codium_. They are all salt water forms.\r\n\r\nOrder 8. =Valoniaceæ.= The thallus is generally multicellular, without\r\ndifferentation into stem- or leaf-structures, but the cells are\r\nsometimes united together and form a leaf-like reticulate expansion\r\n(_e.g. Anadyomene_). Zoospores are known in some, and they are then\r\nformed directly in the vegetative cells. In others (_e.g. Valonia_),\r\na mass of protoplasm, which maybe separated through the damaging of\r\na cell, can surround itself with a cell-wall, and grow into a new\r\nplant. No other modes of reproduction are known. The most important\r\ngenera are: _Valonia_, _Siphonocladus_, _Chamædoris_, _Struvea_,\r\n_Microdictyon_, _Anadyomene_. They are all salt water forms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 59.--_Caulerpa prolifera_ (natural size).]\r\n\r\n   As already pointed out, the _Valoniaceæ_ occupy a somewhat\r\n   central position among the Siphoneæ, and present points\r\n   of similarity and contrast with the _Botrydiaceæ_ and the\r\n   _Bryopsidaceæ_ through _Valonia_, with the _Dasycladaceæ_\r\n   through _Chamædoris_, and also with the _Cladophoraceæ_ through\r\n   _Siphonocladus_, and _Struvea_.\r\n\r\nOrder 9. =Dasycladaceæ.= The thallus consists of an axile longitudinal\r\ncell, destitute of transverse walls, attached at the base by root-like\r\norgans of attachment, and producing acropetally whorls of united,\r\nsingle or branched, leaf-like structures with limited growth. Asexual\r\nreproduction is wanting. Sexual reproduction by conjugation of gametes\r\nwhich arise in separate, fertile leaves, either directly or from\r\naplanospores, which develope into gametangia. The principal genera are:\r\n_Acetabularia_, _Dasycladus_, _Neomeris_, _Cymopolia_. All marine.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 60.--_Halimeda opuntia._ Plant (natural\r\n  size). _B_ Part of a longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\nThe curiously shaped _Acetabularia mediterranea_ grows gregariously\r\non limestone rocks, and shells of mussels in the Mediterranean; it\r\nresembles a minute umbrella with a small stem, sometimes as much as\r\nnine centimetres in height, and a shade which may be more than one\r\ncentimetre in diameter. The cell-membrane is thick, and incrusted\r\nwith carbonate and oxalate of lime. Only the lower, root-like part of\r\nthe thallus, which penetrates the calcareous substratum survives the\r\nwinter, and may grow up into a new plant. The sterile leaves, which\r\ndrop off early, are dichotomously branched and formed of cylindrical\r\ncells separated from each other by cross-walls, but they are not grown\r\ntogether. The shade is formed by a circle of 70–100 club-shaped rays\r\n(fertile leaves) grown together, in each ray 40–80 aplanospores are\r\nformed, which become liberated at the breaking of the shade, and later\r\non are changed to gametangia (compare _Botrydium_) which open by a\r\nlid and allow a large number of egg-shaped gametes with two cilia to\r\nescape. Gametes from various gametangia conjugate with one another; the\r\nproduct of the conjugation swarms about for some time, rounds off, and\r\nthen surrounds itself with a cell-wall. The zygote germinates after\r\na period of rest and then produces a sexual plant. The aplanospores\r\n(gametangia) thus represent the sexual generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Class 7. =Characeæ.=\r\n\r\nThe thallus has a stem with nodes and internodes; and whorls of leaves,\r\non which may be developed the antheridia and oogonia, are borne at\r\nthe nodes. Vegetative reproduction by bulbils and accessory shoots.\r\nZoospores are wanting. The antheridia are spherical, and contain a\r\nnumber of filaments in which the spirally coiled spermatozoids, each\r\nwith two cilia, are formed. The oogonium is situated terminally, and\r\nis at first naked, but becomes later on surrounded by an investment,\r\nand forms after fertilisation the so-called “fruit.” The oospore, after\r\na period of rest, germinates by producing a “proembryo,” from which\r\nthe young sexual plant arises as a lateral branch. The Characeæ are\r\ndistinguished by the structure of their vegetative system as well as by\r\nthe spirally-coiled spermatozoids, and stand as an isolated group among\r\nthe Thallophytes, of which, however, the Siphoneæ appear to be their\r\nnearest relations. They were formerly, but wrongly, placed near the\r\nMosses. The class contains only one order, the Characeæ.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Characeæ.= Algæ with a peculiar odour, often incrusted with\r\nlime, and of a brittle nature. They generally grow gregariously in\r\nlarge masses at the bottom of fresh and brackish water, and are from a\r\nfew inches to more than a foot in height. The stem has long internodes\r\nwhich in _Nitella_ are formed of one cylindrical cell; in _Chara_ of\r\na similar cell, but closely surrounded by a cortical layer of smaller\r\nones. The protoplasm in contact with the cell-wall exhibits in a\r\nwell-marked degree the movement of rotation (cyclosis), carrying the\r\nchlorophyll corpuscles along with it. The internodes are separated\r\nfrom each other by a layer of small cells (nodal cells) from which the\r\nleaves are produced. The leaves are borne in whorls of from 5–12 which\r\nregularly alternate with one another as in the higher verticillate\r\nplants; a branch is borne in the axil of the first formed leaf of each\r\nwhorl (Fig. 61 _A_, _n_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 61.--_Chara fragilis.

D_ Filament from antheridium with spermatozoids. _E_\r\n  Free spermatozoids.]\r\n\r\nThe leaves are constructed in the same manner as the stem; they are\r\ndivided into a series of joints, but have only a limited power of\r\ngrowth; their terminal cell, too, is not enclosed by a cortex. Leaflets\r\nare borne at their nodes. The growth of the stem is unlimited, and\r\nproceeds by means of an apical cell (Fig. 62 _s_). The apical cell\r\ndivides into a segment-cell and a new apical cell. The segment-cell\r\nthen divides by a transverse wall into two cells, one lying above the\r\nother; the lower one, without any further division, becomes one of the\r\nlong, cylindrical, internodal cells (Fig. 62 _in_), and the upper one\r\n(Fig. 62 _n_) divides by vertical walls to form the nodal cells. The\r\ncortical cells (Fig. 62 _r_) which surround the long internodal cells\r\nof _Chara_, are derived from the divisions of the nodal cells; the\r\ncells covering the upper portion of an internodal cell being derived\r\nfrom the node immediately above it, and those in the lower part of the\r\ninternode from the node below it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 62.--_Chara fragilis_: _s_ apical cell; _n_,\r\n  _n_ nodal cells; _in_ internodal cells; _bl_, _bl_ leaves; _r_,\r\n  _r_ the cortical cells.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Oogonium of _Chara_: _k_ “crown”; _u_\r\n  receptive spot; _s_ spermatozoids.]\r\n\r\nThe organs of reproduction are very conspicuous by their colour\r\nand form. They are always situated on the leaves, the plants being\r\nvery frequently monœcious. The antheridia (Fig. 61 _B_, _a_) are\r\nmodified leaflets or the terminal cell of a leaf; they are spherical\r\nand become red when mature. Their wall consists of 8 “shields,”\r\n_i.e._ of plate-like cells, 4 of which cover the upper half, and are\r\ntriangular; the 4 round the lower half, to which the stalk of the\r\nantheridia is attached, being quadrilateral, with sides of unequal\r\nlength. The shields (Fig. 61 _C_) have dentated edges, with the teeth\r\nfitting into one another, and their faces ornamented with ridges. From\r\nthe centre of the internal face of each shield (_C_) a cylindrical\r\ncell, the _manubrium_, projects nearly as far as the centre of the\r\nantheridium; at the inner end of each of the manubria a spherical\r\ncell, the _capitulum_, is situated. Each capitulum bears six secondary\r\ncapitula, from each of which four long coiled filaments (_C_, _D_)\r\nproject into the cavity of the antheridium. These filaments are divided\r\nby transverse walls into from 100–200 discoid cells, in each of which\r\na biciliated, coiled spermatozoid is developed (_D_, _E_) from the\r\nnucleus. The spermatozoids escape from their mother-cell and are set\r\nfree by the shields separating from one other.\r\n\r\nThe female organ of reproduction (Fig. 61 _B_, 63) is a small modified\r\nshoot, whose apical cell functions as an oogonium, its protoplasm\r\nforming the oosphere, which has a colourless receptive-spot at the\r\nsummit (Fig. 63 _u_). The oogonium is situated on a nodal cell, from\r\nwhich 5 cells grow out in a circle and coil round the oogonium,\r\ncovering it with a close investment. These cells divide once or twice\r\nat the top, so that 5 or 10 small cells are cut off, which project\r\nabove the oogonium and form the so-called “crown” (Fig. 63 _k_). The\r\ncrown either drops off at fertilisation, or its cells separate to form\r\na central canal for the passage of the spermatozoids. The wall of the\r\noosphere[9] above the receptive spot becomes mucilaginous, and allows\r\nthe spermatozoid to fuse with the oosphere. The oospore, on germination\r\n(Fig. 64 _sp_), becomes a small filamentous plant of limited growth\r\n(Fig. 64 _i_, _d_, _q_, _pl_)--the proembryo--and from this, as a\r\nlateral outgrowth, the sexual generation is produced.\r\n\r\nThe order is divided into two sub-orders:--\r\n\r\nA. NITELLEÆ. The crown consists of 10 cells; cortex absent: _Nitella_,\r\n_Tolypella_.\r\n\r\nB. CHAREÆ. The crown consists of 5 cells; cortex present:\r\n_Tolypellopsis_, _Lamprothamnus_, _Lychnothamnus_, _Chara_.\r\n\r\n_Chara crinita_ is parthenogenetic; in large districts of Europe\r\nonly female plants are found, yet oospheres are formed capable of\r\ngermination.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 64.--_Chara fragilis._ Germinating oospore\r\n  (_sp_); _i_, _d_, _g_, _pl_, form together the proembryo rhizoids\r\n  (_w′_) are formed at _d_; _w′_ the so-called tap-root; at _g_ are\r\n  the first leaves of the sexual plant, which appears as a lateral\r\n  bud.]\r\n\r\nAbout 40 species of fossilized _Chara_, determined by their carpogonia,\r\nare known in the geological formations from the Trias up to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Class 8. =Phæophyceæ (Olive-Brown Seaweeds).=\r\n\r\nThe Phæophyceæ are Algæ, with chromatophores in which the chlorophyll\r\nis masked by a brown colour (phycophæin). The product of assimilation\r\nis a carbohydrate (fucosan), _never true starch_. In the highest\r\nforms (_Fucaceæ_), the thallus presents differentiation into stem,\r\nleaf, and root-like structures. The asexual reproduction takes place\r\nby means of zoospores. The sexual reproduction is effected by the\r\ncoalescence of motile gametes, or by oogamous fertilisation. The\r\nswarm-cells are _monosymmetric_, each moved by two cilia which are true\r\nprotoplasmic structures, and generally _attached laterally_ (Fig. 65).\r\nThe Phæophyceæ are almost entirely saltwater forms; a few species of\r\n_Lithoderma_ live in fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe class is divided into two families:--\r\n\r\n1. PHÆOSPOREÆ: 1 Sub-Family, Zoogonicæ; 2 Sub-Family, Acinetæ.\r\n\r\n2. CYCLOSPOREÆ: Fucaceæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 1. =Phæosporeæ.=\r\n\r\nThe family consists of multicellular plants, whose cells are firmly\r\nunited together to form a thallus; this, in the simplest cases, may be\r\na branched filament of cells (_Ectocarpus_), or, in the highest, may\r\nresemble a stem with leaves (_Laminariaceæ_), while all transitional\r\nforms may be found between these two. The thallus grows by intercalary\r\ndivisions (_e.g. Ectocarpus_), or by an apical cell (_e.g._\r\n_Sphacelaria_); pseudo-parenchymatous tissue may sometimes be formed by\r\ncells, which were originally distinct, becoming united together. The\r\nsize of the thallus varies; in some species it is quite small--almost\r\nmicroscopical,--while in the largest it is many metres in length.\r\n\r\nThe vegetative cells in the lower forms are nearly uniform, but in\r\nthose which are more highly developed (_Laminariaceæ_ and _Fucaceæ_),\r\nthey are sometimes so highly differentiated that mechanical,\r\nassimilating, storing and conducting systems may be found; the last\r\nnamed systems are formed of long cells with perforated, transverse\r\nwalls, which bear a strong resemblance to the sieve-tubes in the higher\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 65.--Swarmspore of _Cutleria multifida_.]\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter in the living cells (“phæophyl”) contains\r\nchlorophyll; but this is concealed by a brown (“phycophæin”), and a\r\nyellow (“phycoxanthin”) colouring material, and hence all these Algæ\r\nare a lighter or darker _yellow-brown_. Starch is not formed. Asexual\r\nreproduction takes place, (1) by zoospores which arise in unilocular\r\nzoosporangia, and are monosymmetric, with two cilia attached laterally\r\nat the base of the colourless anterior end (Fig. 65), the longer\r\none being directed forwards and the shorter backwards; or (2) by\r\naplanospores (?).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 66.--_Ectocarpus siliculosus_. _I a-f_ A\r\n  female gamete in the various stages of coming to rest. _II_ A\r\n  motionless female gamete surrounded by male gametes. _III a-e_\r\n  Stages in the coalescence of male and female gametes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 67.--_Zanardinia collaris_. _A_ Male\r\n  gametangia (the smaller celled) and female gametangia (the\r\n  larger celled). _C_ Female gamete. _D_ Male gamete. _B_, _E_\r\n  Fertilisation. _F_ Zygote. _G_ Germinating zygote.]\r\n\r\nSexual reproduction has only been discovered in a few cases, and takes\r\nplace by means of gametes (oogamous fertilisation perhaps occurs in the\r\nTilopteridæ). The gametes have the same structure as the zoospores,\r\nand arise in multilocular gametangia; these, like the zoosporangia,\r\nare outgrowths from the external surface, or arise as modifications\r\nfrom it. The conjugating gametes may be similar (_e.g. Ectocarpus\r\npusillus_), or there may be a more or less pronounced difference of\r\nsex, an indication of which is found in _Ectocarpus siliculosus_ (Fig.\r\n66). When the gametes in this species have swarmed for a time, some,\r\nwhich are generally larger, are seen to attach themselves by one of the\r\ncilia, which by degrees is shortened to form a kind of stalk (compare\r\nthe upper gamete in Fig. 66 _II_); these are the female gametes, which\r\nnow become surrounded by a number of males endeavouring to conjugate\r\nwith them, but only one succeeds in effecting fertilisation. The\r\nprotoplasm of the two gametes coalesces (Fig. 66 _III_), and a zygote\r\n(_e_) is formed. The male gametes which do not conjugate may germinate,\r\nbut the plants derived from them are much weaker than those produced\r\nby the zygotes. Strongly pronounced sexual differences are found in\r\nthe Cutleriaceæ, in which order the male and female gametes arise in\r\nseparate gametangia (Fig. 67 _A_). The male gametes (Fig. 67 _D_) are\r\nmuch smaller than the female gamete (Fig. 67 _C_); the latter, after\r\nswarming for a short time, withdraws the cilia, and is then ready to\r\nbecome fertilised (Fig. 67 _B_, _E_), thus we have here a distinct\r\ntransition to the oogamous fertilisation which is found in the Fucaceæ.\r\nAlternation of generations is rarely found.\r\n\r\n1. Sub-Family. =Zoogonicæ.=\r\n\r\nReproduction by means of gametes and zoospores.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Ectocarpaceæ.= The thallus consists of single or branched\r\nfilaments with intercalary growth, extending vertically from a\r\nhorizontal, branched filament or a disc, but sometimes it is reduced to\r\nthis basal portion only. Zoosporangia and gametangia (for fertilisation\r\nsee Fig. 66) are either outgrowths or arise by the transformation of\r\none or several of the ordinary cells. The most common genera are:\r\n_Ectocarpus_ and _Pylaiella_.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Choristocarpaceæ.= _Choristocarpus_, _Discosporangium_.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Sphacelariaceæ.= The thallus consists of small,\r\nparenchymatous, more or less ramified shoots, presenting a feather-like\r\nappearance. In the shoots, which grow by means of an apical cell (Fig.\r\n68 _S_), a cortical layer, surrounding a row of central cells, is\r\npresent. Sporangia and gametangia are outgrowths from the main stem or\r\nits branches. _Sphacelaria_, _Chætopteris_ are common forms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 68.--Apex of the thallus of _Chætopteris\r\n  plumosa_. _S_ Apical cell.]\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Encoeliaceæ.= _Punctaria_, _Asperococcus_, _Phyllitis fascia_.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Striariaceæ.= _Striaria_, _Phlœospora_.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Dictyosiphonaceæ.= _Dictyosiphon._\r\n\r\nOrder 7. =Desmarestiaceæ.= _Desmarestia aculeata_ is common.\r\n\r\nOrder 8. =Myriotrichiaceæ.= _Myriotrichia._\r\n\r\nOrder 9. =Elachistaceæ.= _Elachista fucicola_ is a common epiphyte on\r\nspecies of _Fucus_.\r\n\r\nOrder 10. =Chordariaceæ.= The shoot-systems are often surrounded\r\nby mucilage. _Chordaria_; _Leathesia difformis_ occurs as rounded,\r\nbrown-green masses of the size of a nut, generally attached to other\r\nSeaweeds.\r\n\r\nOrder 11. =Stilophoraceæ.= _Stilophora rhizodes_ is common.\r\n\r\nOrder 12. =Spermatochnaceæ.= _Spermatochnus paradoxus_ is common.\r\n\r\nOrder 13. =Sporochnaceæ.= _Sporochnus._\r\n\r\nOrder 14. =Ralfsiaceæ.= _Ralfsia verrucosa_ is common as a red-brown\r\nincrustation on stones and rocks at the water’s edge.\r\n\r\nOrder 15. =Lithodermataceæ.= Some species of the genus _Lithoderma_\r\noccur in fresh water.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 69.--_Laminaria digitata_ (much reduced in\r\n  size).]\r\n\r\nOrder 16. =Laminariaceæ.= The thallus is more or less leathery, and\r\nhas generally a root-like lower part (Fig. 69) which serves to attach\r\nit, and a stalk or stem-like part, terminated by a large leaf-like\r\nexpansion. Meristematic cells are situated at the base of the leaf,\r\nand from these the new leaves are derived. The older leaf thus pushed\r\naway by the intercalary formation of the younger ones, soon withers\r\n(Fig. 69). Gametes are wanting. Zoosporangia are developed from\r\nthe lower part of a simple, few-celled sporangiophore, which is an\r\noutgrowth from a surface-cell and has a large club-formed apical cell.\r\nThe sporangia are aggregated into closely packed sori, which cover\r\nthe lower part of the terminal leaf, or occur on special, smaller,\r\nlateral, fertile fronds (_Alaria_). Most of the species belonging to\r\nthis order live in seas of moderate or cold temperature and occur\r\nin the most northern regions that have yet been explored, forming\r\ntheir organs of reproduction during the cold and darkness of the\r\narctic night. _Laminaria_ is destitute of a midrib and has only one\r\nterminal leaf. _L. digitata_ has a broad leaf, which, by the violence\r\nof the waves, is torn into a number of palmate strips (Fig. 69). _L.\r\nsaccharina_ has a small, undivided leaf. _Alaria_ has a midrib and\r\nspecial fertile fronds. _A. esculenta_ occurs plentifully on the west\r\ncoast of Norway and on the shores of Great Britain. _Chorda filum_, a\r\ncommon seaweed, is thick, unbranched, and attains a length of several\r\nmetres, without any strong demarcation between stalk and leaf. Some\r\nattain quite a gigantic size, _e.g. Macrocystis pyrifera_, whose\r\nthallus is said sometimes to be more than 300 metres in length. The\r\n_Lessonia_-species, like the above, form submarine forests of seaweed\r\non the south and south-west coasts of South America, the Cape, and\r\nother localities in the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n   USES. The large Laminarias, where they occur in great numbers,\r\n   are, like the Fuci, used for various purposes, for example, in\r\n   the production of iodine and soda, and as an article of food\r\n   (_Laminaria saccharina_, _Alaria esculenta_, etc.). _Laminaria\r\n   saccharina_ contains a large quantity of sugar (mannit) and is\r\n   in some districts used in the preparation of a kind of syrup;\r\n   in surgical operations it is employed for the distension of\r\n   apertures and passages, as for instance the ear-passage. It\r\n   is by reason of the anatomical peculiarities and structure of\r\n   the cell-walls, that they are employed for this purpose. The\r\n   cell-walls are divided into two layers, an inner one which\r\n   has very little power of swelling, and an outer one, well\r\n   developed and almost gelatinous--the so-called “intercellular\r\n   substance”--which shrivels up when dried, but can absorb water\r\n   and swell to about five times its size. The stalks of _Laminaria\r\n   clustoni_ are officinal.\r\n\r\nOrder 17. =Cutleriaceæ.= The thallus is formed by the union of the\r\noriginally free, band-shaped shoots. The growth is intercalary. Sexual\r\nreproduction by the conjugation of male and female gametes. An asexual\r\ngeneration of different appearance, which produces zoospores, arises\r\nfrom the germination of the zygote. _Cutleria_, _Zanardinia_.\r\n\r\nSub-Family 2. =Acinetæ.=\r\n\r\nBranched, simple cell-rows with intercalary growth. The organs\r\nof reproduction are partly uni-and partly multicellular; in the\r\nunicellular ones a cell without cilia is formed, which may be destitute\r\nof a cell-wall, but has one nucleus (oosphere?), or which has a\r\ncell-wall and contains several (generally four) nuclei (aplanospores?);\r\nin the multicellular, monosymmetric swarm-cells with two cilia\r\n(spermatozoids?) are formed. The fertilisation has not been observed.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Tilopteridaceæ.= _Haplospora_, _Tilopteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 2. =Cyclosporeæ.=\r\n\r\nThe individuals are multicellular, with growth by an apical cell. The\r\nthallus--often bilateral--is differentiated into a root-like structure\r\n(attachment-disc), and stem, sometimes also into leaves (_Sargassum_).\r\nSometimes a differentiation occurs into various tissue-systems, viz. an\r\nexternal assimilating tissue, a storing tissue, a mechanical tissue\r\nof thickened, longitudinal, parenchymatous, strengthening cells, and\r\na conducting tissue of sieve-cells, or of short sieve-tubes with\r\nperforated walls. Colouring material, as in Phæosporeæ. Vegetative\r\nreproduction can only take place by means of detached portions of the\r\nthallus (_Sargassum_), which are kept floating by means of bladders\r\n(Fig. 70 _A_, _a_, Fig. 72). Zoospores are wanting.\r\n\r\nThe sexual reproduction takes place by oogamous fertilisation. The\r\noogonia and antheridia are formed inside special organs (conceptacles),\r\nand are surrounded by paraphyses. The conceptacles (Fig. 70 _B_,\r\nFig. 71 _b_) are small, pear-shaped or spherical depressions,\r\nproduced by a special ingrowth of the surface cells of the thallus,\r\nand their mouths (_ostioles_) project like small warts; they are\r\neither situated near the end of the ordinary branches of the thallus\r\n(_Fucus serratus_, Fig. 71 _a_) which may be swollen on this account\r\n(_Fucus vesiculosus_, Fig. 70 _A_, _b_), or on special short branches\r\n(_Ascophyllum_, _Sargassum_). The vertical section of a conceptacle is\r\nseen in Fig. 70 _B_ (see also Fig. 71 _b_) where, in addition to the\r\nparaphyses, oogonia only are seen (_F. vesiculosus_ is diœcious--male\r\nplant, yellow-brown; female plant, olive-brown); but in some\r\nspecies antheridia, together with oogonia, are produced in the same\r\nconceptacle. The oogonia are large, almost spherical cells, situated on\r\na short stalk, in each of which are formed from 1–8 (in _Fucus_, 8; in\r\n_Ascophyllum_, 4; in _Halidrys_, 1; in _Pelvetia_, 2) rounded, immotile\r\noospheres. The wall of the oogonium ruptures, and the oospheres,\r\nstill enclosed in the inner membrane, are ejected through the mouth\r\nof the conceptacle, and float about in the water, being finally set\r\nfree by the bursting of the inner membrane. The antheridia are oblong\r\ncells (Fig. 70 _C_, _a_), many of which are produced on the same\r\nbranched antheridiophore (Fig. 70 _C_); the numerous spermatozoids are\r\nprovided with 2 cilia and are very small (Fig. 70 _D_, two antheridia\r\nsurrounded by spermatozoids, one being open). The spermatozoids, still\r\nenclosed by the inner membrane of the antheridium, are similarly\r\nset free, and fertilisation takes place in the water, numerous\r\nspermatozoids collecting round the oosphere (Fig. 70 _E_), which is\r\nmany times larger, and by their own motion causing it to rotate. After\r\nfertilisation, the oospore surrounds itself with a cell-wall and\r\ngerminates immediately, attaching itself (Fig. 70 _F_) to some object,\r\nand by cell-division grows into a new plant.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 70.--_Fucus vesiculosus.

A portion of the\r\n  thallus, natural size.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Fucaceæ.= The following species are common on our coasts:\r\n_Fucus vesiculosus_ (Fig. 70) has a thallus with an entire margin,\r\nand with bladders arranged in pairs; _F. serratus_ (Fig. 71) without\r\nbladders, but with serrated margin; _Ascophyllum nodosum_ has\r\nstrap-like shoots, which here and there are swollen to form bladders;\r\n_Halidrys siliquosa_ has its swimming bladders divided by transverse\r\nwalls; _Himanthalia lorea_, which is found on the west coast of Norway,\r\nand the south coast of England, has a small perennial, button-shaped\r\npart, from the centre of which proceeds the long and sparsely branched,\r\nstrap-like, annual shoot, which bears the conceptacles. The Gulf-weed\r\n(_Sargassum bacciferum_, Fig. 72) is well known historically from the\r\nvoyage of Columbus; it is met with in large, floating, detached masses\r\nin all oceans, and is found most abundantly in the Atlantic, off the\r\nCanary Islands and the Azores, and towards the Bermudas. The stalked,\r\nspherical air-bladders are the characteristic feature of this genus.\r\nThe thallus is more highly developed than in _Fucus_, and there is a\r\ncontrast between the stem and leaf-like parts. The portions which are\r\nfound floating are always barren, only those attached are fertile.\r\n\r\n   USES. The Fucaceæ, like the Laminariaceæ, are used as manure\r\n   (the best kinds being _Fucus vesiculosus_ and _Ascophyllum\r\n   nodosum_), for burning to produce kelp, and as food for domestic\r\n   animals (_Ascophyllum nodosum_ is especially used for this\r\n   purpose).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Class 9. =Dictyotales.=\r\n\r\nThe plants in this class are multicellular, and brown, with apical\r\ngrowth, new cells being derived either from a flat apical cell, or from\r\na border of apical cells. The thallus is flat, leaf- or strap-shaped,\r\nattached by haptera, which are either found only at the base, or\r\non the whole of the lower expansion of the thallus. The cells are\r\ndifferentiated into the following systems of tissues: an external,\r\nsmall-celled layer of assimilating cells, generally one cell in\r\nthickness, and an internal, large-celled layer of one or only a few\r\ncells in thickness, forming the mechanical and conducting tissues.\r\nAll the reproductive cells are motionless. Asexual reproduction by\r\nnaked, motionless spores (tetraspores) which are formed 1–4 in each\r\ntetrasporangium, the latter being outgrowths from the surface cells\r\nof special, sexless individuals. Zoospores are wanting. The sexual\r\norgans are of two kinds, oogonia and antheridia, which are formed from\r\nthe surface cells, either on the same or different individuals. The\r\noogonia are spherical or oval, and are generally placed close together;\r\neach contains one oosphere, which on maturity is ejected into the\r\nsurrounding water, and is then naked and motionless. The antheridia\r\nare formed of longitudinal cells, united in groups, whose contents\r\nby repeated divisions--transverse and longitudinal--are divided into\r\na large number of small, colourless, motionless spermatia--round or\r\nelongated--which are set free by the dissolution of the wall of the\r\nantheridium. The process of fertilisation has not yet been observed.\r\n\r\nThe Dictyotales, in having tetraspores and spermatia, deviate\r\nconsiderably from the Phæophyceæ, but may be classed near to the\r\nTilopteridæ, in which there are asexual spores with 4 cell-nuclei,\r\nwhich may be considered as an indication of the formation of\r\ntetraspores.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Dictyotaceæ.= _Dictyota dichotoma_ which has a thin,\r\n   regularly dichotomously divided thallus, occurs on the coasts of\r\n   the British Isles. _Padina_ is found on the south coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Class 10. =Rhodophyceæ (Red Seaweeds).=\r\n\r\nThe plants comprised in this class are multicellular; they are\r\nsimple or branched filaments, or expansions consisting of 1 to\r\nseveral layers of cells; the thallus may be differentiated (as\r\nin many _Florideæ_), to resemble stem, root, and leaf. The cells\r\ncontain a distinctly differentiated nucleus (sometimes several),\r\nand distinct chromatophores, coloured by rhodophyll. The chlorophyll\r\nof the chromatophores is generally masked by a red colouring matter\r\n(phycoerythrin), which may be extracted in cold, fresh water; or rarely\r\nby phycocyan. Pyrenoids occur in some. Starch is never formed in the\r\nchromatophores themselves, but a modification--Florideæ starch--may\r\nbe found in the colourless protoplasm. Asexual reproduction by motile\r\nor motionless spores (tetraspores) which are devoid of cilia and of\r\ncell-wall. Swarmspores are never found.\r\n\r\nSexual reproduction is wanting, or takes place by the coalescence of\r\na spermatium and a more or less developed female cell. The spermatia\r\nare naked masses of protoplasm, devoid of cilia and chromatophores.\r\nThe female cell (carpogonium) is enclosed by a cell-wall, and after\r\nfertilisation forms a number of spores, either with or without\r\ncell-walls (carpospores), which grow into new individuals.\r\n\r\nThe Rhodophyceæ may be divided into two families:\r\n\r\n    1. BANGIOIDEÆ.\r\n    2. FLORIDEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 1. =Bangioideæ.=\r\n\r\nThe thallus consists of a branched or unbranched cell-filament, formed\r\nof a single row or of many rows of cells, or of an expansion, one or\r\ntwo layers of cells in thickness, but without conspicuous pores for the\r\nintercommunication of the cells. The growth of the thallus is chiefly\r\nintercalary. The star-like chromatophores contain chlorophyll and are\r\ncoloured blue-green with phycocyan, or reddish with phycoerythrin;\r\nall these colouring matters are occasionally found in the same cell\r\n(_Bangia_-species). Asexual reproduction by tetraspores, without cilia,\r\nbut capable of amœboid movements.\r\n\r\nSexual reproduction is wanting, or takes place by the coalescence of a\r\nspermatium with a carpogonium, which is only slightly differentiated\r\nfrom the vegetative cells, and is devoid of a trichogyne. The\r\ncarpospores are destitute of cell-wall and arise directly by the\r\ndivision of the fertilised oosphere. The Bangioideæ occur chiefly in\r\nsalt water.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Goniotrichaceæ.=--The thallus consists of a\r\n   branched cell-filament without rhizoids. Tetraspores are\r\n   formed directly from the entire contents of the mother-cell,\r\n   without any preceding division. Fertilisation unknown.\r\n   _Asterocystis_, _Goniotrichum_.\r\n\r\n   The _Goniotrichaceæ_, through the blue-green _Asterocystis_,\r\n   are allied to the Myxophyceæ, and through _Goniotrichum_ to the\r\n   _Porphyraceæ_.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Porphyraceæ.=--The thallus is formed of an expansion\r\n   consisting of a layer of 1–2 cells, which, at the base, are\r\n   attached to the substratum by means of a special form of haptera\r\n   (_Porphyra_, _Diploderma_); or of unbranched (very rarely\r\n   slightly branched) filaments, attached at the base by haptera\r\n   (_Bangia_): or it extends from a prostrate cell-disc (various\r\n   species of _Erythrotrichia_). Tetraspores are formed after one\r\n   or more divisions of the mother-cell, either from the whole or\r\n   only a part of its contents; they possess amœboid movements,\r\n   or have a jerky, sliding-forward motion. The antheridia have\r\n   the same appearance as the vegetative cells, but divide several\r\n   times, and several spermatia are formed, either simultaneously\r\n   from the whole contents (_Porphyra_, _Bangia_), or the spermatia\r\n   are successively formed from a part of the contents of the\r\n   antheridium (_Erythrotrichia_). The carpogonium is without a\r\n   trichogyne, but the oosphere has a colourless spot which may\r\n   sometimes rise a little above the surface of the thallus, and\r\n   may be considered as an early stage in the development of the\r\n   trichogyne. The spermatia form a canal through the membrane of\r\n   the carpogonium, and their contents coalesce with the oosphere\r\n   at its colourless spot. The fertilised oosphere divides on\r\n   germination into a number of carpospores, which are set free as\r\n   naked, motionless masses of protoplasm, which grow and give rise\r\n   to new individuals (alternation of generations).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Family 2. =Florideæ.=\r\n\r\nThe thallus has one or more apical cells, grows principally by apical\r\ngrowth, and may be differentiated into root, stem, and leaf. The\r\nchromatophores vary in form, but have a red or brownish colour, due\r\nto chlorophyll and phycoerythrin. Asexual reproduction by motionless\r\ntetraspores, which generally arise by the division into four of the\r\ncontents of the tetrasporangium. The carpogonium has a trichogyne,\r\nand the carpospores, which are formed indirectly from the fertilised\r\noosphere, possess a cell-wall.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 73.--_Callithamnion elegans_: _a_ a plant\r\n  with tetraspores (× 20); _b_ apex of a branch with tetraspores(×\r\n  250).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 74.--_Polysiphonia variegata_: _a_ a portion\r\n  of a male plant with antheridia; _b_ spermatia; _c_ transverse\r\n  section of thallus.]\r\n\r\nThe thallus may assume very different forms. In the simplest species\r\nit is filamentous and formed of single, branched rows of cells\r\n(_Callithamnion_, etc., Fig. 73). _Ceramium_ has a filamentous thallus,\r\ngenerally dichotomously forked (Fig. 75), or sometimes pinnately\r\nbranched, which, at the nodes, or throughout its entire length, is\r\ncovered by a layer of small cortical cells. _Polysiphonia_ (Fig.\r\n74) has a filamentous, much branched thallus, made up of a central\r\ncylindrical cell, surrounded by a layer of other cells, cortical cells,\r\nwhich in length and position correspond to the central ones. In many of\r\nthe Red Algæ the vegetative organs are differentiated into stems and\r\nleaves, the former having, as in _Chara_, unlimited growth in length,\r\nwhilst the latter soon attain their full development. _Chondrus_\r\nhas a fleshy, gelatinous thallus, without nodes; it is repeatedly\r\nforked into flat branches of varying thickness. _Furcellaria_ has a\r\nforked thallus with thick branches and without nodes. The thallus of\r\n_Delesseria_ (Fig. 76) consists of branches, often bearing leaf-like\r\nstructures, with a midrib and lateral ribs springing from it. These\r\nribs persist through the winter, and at the commencement of the\r\nsucceeding period of vegetation the lateral ribs become the starting\r\npoints for new leaves. In _Corallina_ the thallus is pinnately\r\nbranched, and divided into nodes and internodes. The name has been\r\ngiven to this genus from the fact that the thallus is incrusted with\r\ncarbonate of lime to such a degree that it becomes very hard, and the\r\nwhole plant adopts a coral-like appearance. Other genera which are\r\nsimilarly incrusted, and have a leaf-like or even crustaceous thallus\r\n(such as _Melobesia_, _Lithothamnion_), are included in this family.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the cells of the thallus may be found\r\n_differentiated_ into more or less well defined tissues, so that it\r\nis possible to find special assimilating, mechanical, and conducting\r\ntissues, the last named in some cases having the double function of\r\nconducting and of serving as a reservoir in which starch is found as\r\na reserve material. The cells of the Florideæ, which are formed by the\r\ndivision of a mother-cell into two daughter-cells of unequal size, have\r\nalways larger or smaller pits in the cell-walls, and the thin cell-wall\r\nseparating two pits from each other is perforated by a number of small\r\nholes. These pits are particularly developed in the conducting tissues,\r\nbut sieve-tubes are very rarely to be found.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 75.--_Ceramium diaphanum_ (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 76.--_Delesseria sanguinea_ (about ⅓).]\r\n\r\n_Tetraspores_ may be wanting (_e.g. Lemanea_) or may often arise on\r\nspecial, non-sexual individuals. In some (_e.g. Batrachospermum_)\r\nonly one tetraspore is formed in each tetrasporangium, but the number\r\nis generally four, which may be formed tetrahedrally (Fig. 73) or by\r\ndivisional walls perpendicular to each other, or even in a single row.\r\nThe tetrasporangia in some species are free (Fig. 73), but in the\r\nmajority they are embedded in the thallus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 77.--_A Lejolisia mediterranea_: _r_\r\n  haptera; _s_ longitudinal section through a cystocarp; _p_ the\r\n  empty space left by the liberated spore (_t_). _B-E Nemalion\r\n  multifidum_: _a_ antheridia; _b_ procarpium with trichogyne, to\r\n  which two spermatia are adhering.]\r\n\r\nThe sexual reproduction (discovered by Thuret and Bornet, 1867)\r\ndiffers in the essential points from that of all other plants, and\r\napproaches most nearly to the sexual reproduction of the _Bangioideæ_.\r\nThe sexual cells are developed from the terminal cells (never nodal\r\ncells) of the branched cell-filaments, which constitute the thallus.\r\nThe mother-cells of the spermatia (_spermatangia_) are generally\r\narranged in a group, in the so-called _antheridia_ (Figs. 74, 77 _A_,\r\n_a_). On becoming ripe the membrane of the spermatangium ruptures\r\nand the _spermatia_ emerge as spherical or ovoid, naked (a little\r\nlater they may possess a cell-wall) masses of protoplasm which are\r\nnot endowed with the power of motion, and hence are carried passively\r\nby the current of the water in which they may happen to be, to the\r\nfemale cell. This latter is analogous with the oogonium of the Green\r\nAlgæ. The female reproductive organ is termed the _procarpium_, and\r\nconsists of two parts, a lower swollen portion--the _carpogonium_\r\n(Fig. 77 _b_ in _A_ and _B_)--which contains the cell-nucleus, and an\r\nupper filamentous prolongation--the _trichogyne_ (Fig. 77 _B_)--which\r\nis homologous with the colourless receptive spot of the oosphere of\r\nthe Green Algæ, and the _Porphyraceæ_. In the sexual reproduction\r\nof the majority of the Florideæ, a very important part is played by\r\ncertain special cells, rich in cell-contents--the _auxiliary cells_.\r\nThese are either dispersed in the interior of the thallus, or are\r\narranged together in pairs with the cell-filament which bears the\r\ncarpogonium, and are generally united with this to form an independent\r\nmulticellular _procarpium_. The spermatia attach themselves firmly to\r\nthe trichogyne and surround themselves with a cell-wall. The dividing\r\nwall at the point of contact is perforated, and the nucleus of the\r\nspermatium probably travels through the trichogyne to the swollen part\r\nof the procarpium--the _carpogonium_--and fuses with its nucleus. After\r\nfertilisation the trichogyne withers (Fig. 77 _C_), but the lower\r\nportion of the procarpium, constituting the _fertilised oosphere_,\r\ngrows out and forms in various ways, first a tuft of spore-forming\r\nfilaments known as _gonimoblasts_, and finally the _carpospores_. These\r\nlatter form a new asexual generation (compare the germination of the\r\noospore of _Œdogonium_ and _Coleochæte_).\r\n\r\nThe gonimoblasts may arise in three ways:--\r\n\r\n   1. In the _Nemalionales_, branched filaments grow out from the\r\n   oosphere and form an upright, compressed or expanded tuft of\r\n   spore-forming filaments.\r\n\r\n   2. In the _Cryptonemiales_, several branched or unbranched\r\n   filaments (_ooblastema-filaments_) grow out from the oosphere,\r\n   and conjugate in various ways with the auxiliary cells. The\r\n   gonimoblasts are then formed from the single cells produced by\r\n   the conjugation.\r\n\r\n   3. In the _Gigartinales_ and _Rhodymeniales_ the oosphere\r\n   conjugates with an auxiliary cell by means of a short\r\n   ooblastema-filament, and from this auxiliary cell a gonimoblast\r\n   is produced.\r\n\r\n   The motionless _carpospores_, which sometimes in the early\r\n   stages are naked, and afterwards invested with a cell-wall, are\r\n   developed from the terminal cells (and perhaps also from some\r\n   of the other cells) of the branches of the gonimoblast. The\r\n   gonimoblasts constitute sharply defined parts of the plant in\r\n   which the carpospores arise. These parts are called _cystocarps_\r\n   and are either naked (Fig. 77 _E_), or surrounded by a covering\r\n   (pericarp or involucre, Fig. 77 _A_) formed in different\r\n   ways. On this account the Florideæ were formerly divided into\r\n   GYMNOSPOREÆ (_Batrachospermum_, _Nemalion_, _Ceramium_, etc.)\r\n   and ANGIOSPOREÆ (_Farcellaria_, _Lejolisia_, _Delesseria_,\r\n   _Melobesia_, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe Florideæ are divided into four sub-families:--\r\n\r\n   Sub-Family 1. =Nemalionales.= The fertilised oosphere produces\r\n   directly the gonimoblast.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Lemaneaceæ.= Algæ of brownish colour and living in\r\n   fresh water. They lack tetraspores, and the very sparingly\r\n   branched fertile filaments, composed of many rows of cells, grow\r\n   out from a proembryo, which consists of a single row of cells\r\n   bearing branches. _Lemanea fluviatilis_, often found on rocks\r\n   and stones in quickly flowing streams.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Helminthocladiaceæ.= Tetraspores are generally wanting\r\n   (_e.g._ in _Nemalion_) or arise one in each tetrasporangium\r\n   (_e.g. Batrachospermum_) and it is only in _Liagora_\r\n   that four cruciate tetraspores are formed. _Chantransia\r\n   corymbifera_ consists of simple, branched cell-rows, and is\r\n   an independent species. Several other _Chantransia-forms_,\r\n   living in fresh water, are “proembryos” of species of the genus\r\n   _Batrachospermum_. The germinating carpospore grows out into\r\n   filaments and forms a so-called proembryo which, if not shaded,\r\n   attains only a small size, but when growing in shady situations\r\n   presents a much greater development. These highly developed\r\n   proembryos have been described as species of _Chantransia_.\r\n   The proembryo can reproduce by division, or by tetraspores\r\n   which are developed singly in the sporangia; in _B. vagum_ and\r\n   _B. sporulans_ which do not possess fully developed female\r\n   reproductive organs, the proembryos serve almost entirely to\r\n   reproduce the species. The young _Batrachospermum_-plant arises\r\n   from the end of an upright filament of the proembryo. The\r\n   proembryo is generally persistent, and continually produces new\r\n   _Batrachospermums_. These latter bear the sexual reproductive\r\n   organs and also whorls of branches: the central row of cells\r\n   is enclosed by cells growing from the base of the whorls of\r\n   branches, and from these cortical cells secondary proembryos\r\n   are developed. In this alternation of shoots there is really\r\n   no alternation of generations, since the proembryo and the\r\n   shoots with the sexual reproductive organs are parts of the same\r\n   thallus.\r\n\r\n   Several species of _Batrachospermum_ have a bluish green or\r\n   verdigris colour. _Nemalion multifidum_ has a brown-red thallus,\r\n   slightly branched, which is attached to rocks near the water’s\r\n   edge.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Chætangiaceæ.= _Galaxaura_ has a thallus thickly\r\n   incrusted with lime.\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Gelidiaceæ.= _Naccaria, Gelidium._\r\n\r\n   Sub-Family 2. =Gigartinales.= The fertilised auxiliary cell\r\n   grows towards the thallus, to produce the gonimoblasts.\r\n   Procarpia generally present.\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Acrotylaceæ.= _Acrotylus._\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Gigartinaceæ.= _Gigartina_, _Phyllophora_,\r\n   _Ahnfeltia_; _Chondrus crispus_, with dark red, dichotomously\r\n   branched thallus, is common on the coasts of Scandinavia and\r\n   Great Britain.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Rhodophyllidaceæ.= _Rhodophyllis_, _Euthora_;\r\n   _Cystoclonium purpurascens_ is common, and sometimes the ends of\r\n   its branches may be modified into tendril-like haptera.\r\n\r\n   Sub-Family 3. =Rhodymeniales.= The fertilised auxiliary cell\r\n   forms the gonimoblast on the side away from the thallus.\r\n   Procarpia are abundantly produced.\r\n\r\n   Order 8. =Sphærococcaceæ.= _Gracilaria._\r\n\r\n   Order 9. =Rhodymeniaceæ.= _Rhodymenia palmata_ is a common\r\n   species. _Lomentaria_, _Chylocladia_, _Plocamium_.\r\n\r\n   Order 10. =Delesseriaceæ.= _Delesseria sanguinea_; _D. alata_\r\n   and _D. sinuosa_ are handsome forms which are not uncommon.\r\n\r\n   Order 11. =Bonnemaisoniaceæ.= _Bonnemaisonia._\r\n\r\n   Order 12. =Rhodomelaceæ.= _Rhodomela_, _Odonthalia_;\r\n   _Polysiphonia_, of which many species are to be found on the\r\n   coasts of Great Britain, has a filamentous, richly branched\r\n   thallus consisting of a central row of cells surrounded by a\r\n   varying number of cortical cells of similar size--the so-called\r\n   “siphons.”\r\n\r\n   Order 13. =Ceramiaceæ.= Pretty Algæ, often branched\r\n   dichotomously, or unilaterally pinnate. _Spermothamnion,\r\n   Griffithsia, Callithamnion, Ceramium, Ptilota._\r\n\r\n   Sub-Family 4. =Cryptonemiales.= The cells formed by the\r\n   coalescence of the auxiliary cells and the ooblastema-filaments,\r\n   produce the gonimoblasts. The _carpogonium-filaments_ and\r\n   the auxiliary cells are scattered singly in the thallus.\r\n\r\n   Order 14. =Gloiosiphoniaceæ.= _Gloiopeltis._\r\n\r\n   Order 15. =Grateloupiaceæ.= _Halymenia, Cryptonemia._\r\n\r\n   Order 16. =Dumontiaceæ.= _Dumontia, Dudresnaya._\r\n\r\n   Order 17. =Nemastomaceæ.= _Furcellaria_, which has\r\n   dichotomously branched, round shoots, is common on the coasts of\r\n   Great Britain.\r\n\r\n   Order 18. =Rhizophyllidaceæ.= _Polyides, Rhizophyllis._\r\n\r\n   Order 19. =Squamariaceæ.= The Algæ belonging to this order\r\n   form crust-like coverings on stones, mussel-shells, and on\r\n   other Algæ, but are not themselves incrustated: _Petrocelis_,\r\n   _Cruoria_, _Peyssonellia_.\r\n\r\n   Order 20. =Corallinaceæ.= Partly crustaceous, partly erect,\r\n   branched Algæ, thickly incrusted with lime, so that a few\r\n   species (_Lithothamnia_, also called _Nullipora_) occur in\r\n   fossilized condition from Jurassic to Tertiary periods.\r\n   _Melobesia, Lithophyllum, Lithothamnion, Corallina._\r\n\r\nUSES. “Carragen” is the thallus of _Chondrus crispus_ (Irish Moss)\r\nand _Gigartina mamillosa_. It is a common article of food on the\r\ncoasts of Ireland, and swells to a jelly when cooked. It is officinal.\r\n_Rhodymenia palmata_ is generally eaten as food in Ireland and in some\r\nplaces on the west coast of Norway; it is also used as food for sheep\r\nand hence is termed “Sheep-seaweed.” Agar-Agar is the jelly obtained\r\nfrom species of _Gelidium_ and _Gigartina_ growing in China and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Sub-Division III. =FUNGI.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mode of Life.= The Fungi have no chlorophyll, and are thus unable in\r\nany stage of their existence to assimilate carbon; they must therefore\r\nlive as _saprophytes_ or _parasites_. There is, however, no strong line\r\nof demarcation between these; many Fungi commence as true parasites,\r\nbut only attain their full development upon or in dead plants or\r\nanimals (_Rhytisma_, _Empusa_). Many saprophytes may occasionally\r\nappear as parasites, and are then designated “_facultative parasites_”\r\n(_Nectria cinnabarina_, _Lophodermium pinastri_), in contradistinction\r\nto those which only appear as parasites, “_obligate parasites_”\r\n(Mildew, Brand-and Rust-Fungi, _Cordyceps_).\r\n\r\nThe parasites which live on the surface of the host-plant are termed\r\n_epiphytic_ (Mildew, _Fusicladium_); and those living in its tissues\r\nare termed _endophytic_ (_Ustilago_, _Peronospora_). _Epizoic_\r\n(_Oidium tonsurans_, _Laboulbenia_) and _endozoic_ Fungi (_Cordyceps_,\r\n_Entomophthora_), are distinguished, in the same manner, as those\r\nwhich live on the surface or in the interior of animals. The Fungi\r\ndesignated _pathogenic_ are especially those which produce disease in\r\nhuman beings and in animals.\r\n\r\nMost of the diseases of plants are attributed to the parasitic Fungi.\r\nThese force their way into the host-plant by piercing the outer wall\r\nof the epidermis, as in the Potato-disease; or by growing in through\r\nthe stomata, _e.g._ the summer generations of the Rust of Wheat; or\r\nthey can only penetrate through a wound, _e.g. Nectria_. Some effect\r\nan entrance into the host-plant by the secretion of a poisonous matter\r\nor ferment, which softens and destroys the cell-walls (_Sclerotinia_).\r\nSome Yeast and Mould Fungi secrete ferments (enzymes), which, for\r\nexample, convert cane-sugar into a sugar capable of fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the parasitic Fungus to the host-plant is mainly of two\r\nkinds. In the one case, the cell-contents are destroyed, the protoplasm\r\nis killed, and the cellular tissue becomes discoloured and dies\r\n(_Peronospora_, _Armillaria mellea_, _Polyporus_); in the other case,\r\nthe parasite has an irritating effect on the cellular tissue, whereby\r\nthe affected organ grows more rapidly and becomes larger than normal,\r\nproducing _hypertrophy_. Such malformations are termed _Fungi-galls_\r\n(Mycocecidia); in this manner “witches’ brooms” are produced by\r\n_Æcidium_, “pocket-plum” by _Taphrina_, and other deformities by\r\n_Exobasidium_ and _Cystopus candidus_. This hypertrophy may either be\r\nproduced by a vigorous cell-multiplication, which is most frequently\r\nthe case, or by the enlargement of the individual cells (_Synchytrium_,\r\n_Calyptospora_). The relation between host and Fungus among the Lichens\r\nis of a very peculiar nature, termed “_symbiosis_.”\r\n\r\n=Vegetative Organs.= The vegetative parts of a Fungus are termed its\r\n_mycelium_.[10] This is formed of a mass of long, cylindrical, branched\r\ncells resembling threads (and hence termed _hyphæ_), which have a\r\ncontinued apical growth. The mycelium, in its early development, shows\r\na well-marked difference between the two main groups of true Fungi:\r\nin the _Phycomycetes_, or Algal Fungi, the mycelium has no transverse\r\nwalls, and is therefore unicellular, while in the _Mesomycetes_ and\r\n_Mycomycetes_ it is provided with dividing walls, which gradually arise\r\nduring growth, in the youngest hyphæ; intercalary transverse walls\r\nmay also be formed at a later period. In the hyphæ of some of the\r\nHigher Fungi (_Hymenomycetes_), connections may be formed between two\r\ncontiguous cells of the same hypha, by a protuberance growing out from\r\nan upper cell just above the transverse wall, and forming a junction\r\nwith the cell below. These are known as _clamp-connections_; they\r\nappear to be of use in affording communication between the two cells.\r\n\r\nThe hyphæ of Fungi, where they come in contact with one another,\r\noften grow together, so that =H=-formed combinations (fusions) are\r\nproduced, which give rise to very compact felted tissue. When the\r\nhyphæ are not only closely interwoven, but also united and provided\r\nwith many transverse walls, the mycelium assumes the appearance of a\r\ntissue with isodiametric cells, and is then termed _pseudo-parenchyma_.\r\nThe hyphæ-walls are sometimes very much thickened, and composed of\r\nseveral layers, and the external layers, by the absorption of water,\r\nmay often swell very much and become mucilaginous. In some instances\r\nthe walls are colourless, in others coloured, the most frequent colour\r\nbeing brown. The cell-contents may also be coloured, and in that case\r\nare generally yellow; this colour is chiefly connected with the fat\r\n(oil) which may be found in abundance in the Fungi, whilst starch is\r\ninvariably absent in all the true Fungi.\r\n\r\nThe mycelium assumes many different forms; sometimes it appears as a\r\nthread-like, cobwebby, loose tissue, less frequently as firm strands,\r\nthin or thick membranes, horn-like plates or tuber-like bodies. The\r\n_thread-like_ mycelium may, in the parasitic Fungi, be intercellular\r\nor intracellular, according as it only extends into the interstices\r\nbetween the cells or enters into the cells proper. In the first case\r\nthere are generally found haustoria, or organs of suction (_e.g._ among\r\nthe _Peronosporaceæ_; _Taphrina_, on the contrary, has no haustoria);\r\nbut haustoria are also found among the epiphytic Fungi (_e.g._\r\nErysiphaceæ). Intracellular mycelia are found in the Rust-Fungi,\r\nin _Claviceps purpurea_, _Entomophthora_, etc. In spite of its\r\ndelicate structure, this mycelium may live a long time, owing to the\r\ncircumstance that it continues to grow peripherally, while the older\r\nparts gradually die off (“fairy rings”).\r\n\r\n_String-like_ mycelia may be found, for example, in _Phallus_,\r\n_Coprinus_, and are formed of hyphæ, which run more or less parallel\r\nto each other. _Membrane-like_ mycelia are chiefly to be found in\r\nFungi growing on tree-stems (Polyporaceæ and Agaricaceæ); they may\r\nhave a thickness varying from that of the finest tissue-paper to that\r\nof thick leather, and may extend for several feet. The peculiar horny\r\nor leather-like strands and plates which, for instance, appear in\r\n_Armillaria mellea_, are known as _Rhizomorpha_; they may attain a\r\nlength of more than fifty feet. The _tuber-like_ mycelia or _sclerotia_\r\nplay the part of resting mycelia, since a store of nourishment is\r\naccumulated in them, and after a period of rest they develope organs of\r\nreproduction. The sclerotia are hard, spherical, or irregular bodies,\r\nfrom the size of a cabbage seed to that of a hand, internally white\r\nor greyish, with a brown or black, pseudo-parenchymatous, external\r\nlayer. Sclerotia only occur in the higher Fungi, and are found both in\r\nsaprophytes, _e.g. Coprinus_, and in parasites, _e.g. Claviceps_\r\n(Ergot), _Sclerotinia_.\r\n\r\n=Reproduction.= SEXUAL REPRODUCTION is found only among the lower Fungi\r\nwhich stand near to the Algæ, the Algal-Fungi, and takes place by the\r\nsame two methods as in the Algæ, namely by _conjugation_ and by the\r\n_fertilisation_ of the egg-cell in the oogonium.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Fungi have only ASEXUAL reproduction. The\r\nmost important methods of this kind of reproduction are the\r\n_sporangio-fructification_ and the _conidio-fructification_.\r\n\r\nIn the SPORANGIO-FRUCTIFICATION the _spores_ (endospores) _arise\r\ninside_ a mother-cell, the sporangium (Fig. 80). Spores without a\r\ncell-wall, which move in water by means of cilia and hence are known\r\nas _swarmspores_ or _zoospores_, are found among the Oomycetes, the\r\nsporangia in which these are produced being called swarm-sporangia or\r\nzoosporangia (Figs. 86, 87, 91, 94).\r\n\r\nIn the CONIDIO-FRUCTIFICATION the _conidia_ (exospores) arise on\r\nspecial hyphæ (conidiophores), or directly from the mycelium. When\r\nconidiophores are present, the conidia are developed upon them\r\nterminally or laterally, either in a basipetal succession (in\r\nmany Fungi, for example in _Penicillium_, Fig. 111, _Erysiphe_,\r\n_Cystopus_), or acropetally (in which method the chains of conidia\r\nare often branched; examples, _Pleospora vulgaris_, _Hormodendron\r\ncladosporioides_). All conidia are at first unicellular, sometimes\r\nat a later stage they become two-celled or multicellular through the\r\nformation of partition-walls (_Piptocephalis_). The conidia with thick,\r\nbrown cell-walls, and contents rich in fats (_resting conidia_), can\r\nwithstand unfavourable external conditions for a much longer period\r\nthan conidia with thin walls and poor in contents.\r\n\r\nThe SPORANGIA arise either from the ordinary cells of the mycelium\r\n(_Protomyces_), or are borne on special hyphæ. They are generally\r\nspherical (_Mucor_, Fig. 80; Saprolegniaceæ), egg-, pear-, or\r\nclub-shaped (Ascomycetes), more rarely they are cylindrical or\r\nspindle-shaped. While among the Phycomycetes the size, form, and\r\nnumber of spores are indefinite in each species, in the Ascomycetes the\r\nsporangia (_asci_) have a definite size, form, and number of spores.\r\nThe spores of the Ascomycetes are known as ascospores.\r\n\r\nThe sporangio-fructification is found under three main forms.\r\n\r\n1. FREE SPORANGIOPHORES which are either single (_Mucor_, Fig. 78), or\r\nbranched (_Thamnidium_).\r\n\r\n2. SPORANGIAL-LAYERS. These are produced by a number of sessile or\r\nshortly-stalked sporangia, being formed close together like a palisade\r\n(_Taphrina_, Fig. 105).\r\n\r\n3. SPORANGIOCARPS. These consist usually of many sporangia enclosed in\r\na covering, they are found only in the Carpoasci, and are also known as\r\n_ascocarps_. The parts of an ascocarp are the _covering_ (_peridium_),\r\nand the _hymenium_, which is in contact with the inner wall of the\r\nperidium, and is generally made up of asci, and sterile, slender\r\nhyphæ. The latter either penetrate between the asci and are branched\r\nand multicellular (_paraphyses_, Figs. 103 _d_, 123, 125, 129), or\r\nclothe those parts of the inner wall which bear no asci (_periphyses_;\r\namong many peronocarpic Ascomycetes, _e.g. Chætomium_, _Sordaria_,\r\n_Stictosphæra hoffmanni_). The ascocarps are produced directly from\r\nthe mycelium, or from a _stroma_, that is a vegetative body of various\r\nforms, in which they may be embedded (Figs. 116 _B_, _C_).\r\n\r\nAmong the conidio-fructifications there are, in the same way, three\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n1. FREE CONIDIOPHORES (Fig. 109). The form of the conidiophores,\r\nthe shape, and number of its spores are various. In the most highly\r\ndeveloped Fungi, the Basidiomycetes, there are, however, special more\r\nhighly developed conidiophores, the _basidia_, which have a definite\r\nform and spores of a definite shape and number. The conidia borne on\r\nbasidia are called _basidiospores_.\r\n\r\n2. CONIDIAL-LAYERS. (_a_) The SIMPLEST case of this is found when\r\nthe conidiophores arise directly from the mycelium, parallel to\r\none another, and form a flat body (_e.g. Exobasidium vaccinii_,\r\n_Hypochnus_; among the Phycomycetes, _Empusa muscæ_ and _Cystopus_).\r\n(_b_) In a HIGHER form the conidial-layers are thick, felted threads\r\n(_stroma_) inserted between the mycelium and the _hymenium_ (_i.e._\r\nthe region of the conidiophores). Examples are found in a section\r\nof the Pyrenomycetes (Fig. 122). (_c_) The HIGHEST form has the\r\n_basidial-layer_, that is a conidial-layer with more highly developed\r\nconidiophores (basidia). The basidial-layer, with stroma, and the\r\nhymenium (region of the basidia), forms the basidio-fructification,\r\nwhich is branched in the Clavariaceæ, and hat-shaped in other\r\nHymenomycetes (in these groups the hymenium is confined to the lower\r\nside of the pileus).\r\n\r\nThe hymenium of the conidial-layer and basidial-layer is composed\r\nentirely of conidiophores, or of conidiophores and sterile hyphæ\r\n(_paraphyses_) which are probably always unicellular. Paraphyses are\r\nfound in _Entomophthora radicans_, and in certain Basidiomycetes\r\n(_e.g. Corticium_).\r\n\r\n3. CONIDIOCARPS (_pycnidia_). A special covering surrounds the\r\nconidia-forming elements. The inner side of this covering (_peridium_)\r\nbears the hymenium, _i.e._ those elements from which the conidia are\r\nabstricted. The conidiocarps arise either immediately from the hyphæ\r\nor from a _stroma_ in which they are generally embedded. Conidiocarps\r\nare entirely wanting in the Phycomycetes. On the other hand they are\r\nfound among the Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, and in the latter group\r\nthe conidiocarps contain more highly differentiated conidiophores\r\n(basidia) and are known as _basidiocarps_. Conidiocarps with simple\r\nconidiophores, are found only among the Basidiomycetes, in the\r\nUredinaceæ, and in _Craterocolla cerasi_. In the Ascomycetes (Figs.\r\n120 _d_, _e_; 117 _a_, _b_; 123 _a_; 124 _b_) the conidiocarps are\r\nvisible, as points, to the naked eye, while the basidiocarps of the\r\nBasidiomycetes (Figs. 170, 171, 173–176, 178–180) vary from the size of\r\na pea to that of a child’s head. The “spermogonia” of the Ascomycetes\r\nand Lichenes, are conidiocarps with small conidia (_microconidia_)\r\nwhich germinate sometimes more slowly than other conidia, and formerly\r\nwere erroneously considered as male reproductive cells, and called\r\nspermatia.\r\n\r\nThe conidia of the Fungi are not primitive structures. The comparison\r\nof the sporangia and conidia among the Zygomycetes, and among the\r\nspecies of the genus _Peronospora_ shows, that the conidia are aberrant\r\nformations, and that they have arisen through the degeneration of the\r\nsporangium, which, by the reduction of its spores to one, has itself\r\nbecome a spore.\r\n\r\n   In the genera _Thamnidium_ and _Chætocladium_ the gradual\r\n   diminution of the sporangia, and the reduction of the number\r\n   of spores can be distinctly followed. In _Thamnidium_ the\r\n   number of spores is often reduced to one, which is _free_ in\r\n   the sporangium. In _Chætocladium_ however the sporangia are\r\n   typically _one-spored_, the spore is always united with the\r\n   sporangium, and the two become a single body, the so-called\r\n   _conidium_, which is in reality a closed sporangium. How\r\n   close is the connection between the sporangia and conidia of\r\n   _Thamnidium_ and _Chætocladium_, is seen from the fact that,\r\n   in the conidial stage of _Chætocladium_ the same whorl-form of\r\n   branching appears as in the sporangial stages of _Thamnidium\r\n   chætocladioides_, and also, that the conidia of _Ch.\r\n   fresenianum_ throw off the former sporangium-wall (exosporium),\r\n   while _Ch. jonesii_ germinates without shedding its exosporium.\r\n   The Phycomycetes have doubtless sprung from Water-Algæ and\r\n   inherit the sporangia from them. On this supposition, as the\r\n   Phycomycetes assumed a terrestrial mode of life, the sporangia\r\n   would become adapted to the distribution of the spores by\r\n   means of the air, the sporangia would become small, contain\r\n   dust-like spores, and would eventually become closed-sporangia,\r\n   _i.e._ conidia. The conidia are a terrestrial method for the\r\n   multiplication of Fungi. In the Hemiasci and the Ascomycetes the\r\n   sporangia are still preserved, but in every instance they are\r\n   adapted to terrestrial spore-distribution, their spores being\r\n   set free on the destruction of the sporangium-wall (generally\r\n   shot out) and distributed through the air. For further examples\r\n   of spore-distribution see below, p. 91–93.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of Fungi is accomplished not only by spores\r\nand conidia, but also sometimes by _chlamydospores_. These are\r\nfundaments[11] of sporangiophores and conidiophores, which have\r\ntaken on a resting condition in the form of a spore, and are able\r\nto germinate and produce carpophores. In the formation of the\r\nchlamydospores the hyphæ accumulate reserve materials at the expense\r\nof the neighbouring cells; in the undivided hyphæ of the Phycomycetes\r\ntransverse walls are formed, and finally the chlamydospores are set\r\nfree by the decay of the empty cells connecting them with the mycelium.\r\nOne must distinguish between _oidia_ and _true chlamydospores_. The\r\nformer are more simple, the latter are a somewhat more differentiated\r\nform of carpophore fundaments, which serve for propagation in the same\r\nmanner as spores. In _Chlamydomucor racemosus_ the chlamydospores\r\ngrow out into the air and form differentiated carpophores. In\r\nthe Autobasidiomycetes they only germinate vegetatively, and\r\nnot with the formation of fructifications. From _Chlamydomucor_\r\nup to the Autobasidiomycetes the successive development of the\r\nfructification, which is interrupted by the formation of the\r\nchlamydospores, degenerates more and more. Among certain Ustilagineæ\r\nthe chlamydospores (brand-spores) no longer germinate with the\r\nproduction of fructifications. In the Uredinaceæ, only one of the three\r\nchlamydospore-forms has the property of producing fructifications\r\non germination; the other forms only germinate vegetatively, like\r\nordinary spores, and in the same manner as the chlamydospores of\r\nthe Autobasidiomycetes. In the Hemibasidii, and the Uredinaceæ, in\r\n_Protomyces_, the chlamydospores are the chief means of reproduction.\r\nThey are found also among the Ascomycetes.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia and the conidia of the Fungi have their common origin\r\nin the sporangia of the Phycomycetes. The asci (and the Ascomycetes\r\nwhich are characterised by these bodies) are descended from the\r\nsporangia-forming, lower Fungi; the basidia (and the Basidiomycetes)\r\nfrom those which bear conidia. _The sporangia of the Phycomycetes are\r\nthe primitive form and the starting point for all the reproductive\r\nforms of the Fungi._ The chlamydospores appear besides in all\r\nclasses of Fungi as supplementary forms of reproduction, and are of\r\nno importance in determining relationships. Although the expression\r\n“fruit” must essentially be applied to true Phanerogams, yet, through\r\nusage, the term “_fruit-forms_,” is employed to designate the forms\r\nor means of reproduction of Fungi, and the organs of reproduction\r\nare known as _organs of fructification_, the sporangiophores\r\nand conidiophores as _fruit-bearers_ (_carpophores_), and the\r\nsporangiocarps, conidiocarps, and basidiocarps as “_fruit-bodies_.”\r\n\r\n   The majority of Fungi have more than one method of reproduction,\r\n   often on various hosts (Uredinaceæ). Species with one, two,\r\n   or more than two methods of reproduction are spoken of as\r\n   having monomorphic, dimorphic, or pleomorphic fructification.\r\n   Monomorphic, _e.g._ the Tuberaceæ; dimorphic, _Mucor_,\r\n   _Piptocephalis_, Saprolegniaceæ, _Penicillium crustaceum_;\r\n   pleomorphic, _Puccinia graminis_, _Capnodium salicinum_ (in the\r\n   last species there are five methods of reproduction: yeast-like\r\n   conidia, free conidiophores, conidiocarps with small and large\r\n   conidia, and ascocarps).\r\n\r\n=The liberation and distribution of the spores and conidia.= The spores\r\nand conidia, on account of their small size and lightness, are spread\r\nfar and wide by currents in the air, but in addition to this method,\r\ninsects and other animals frequently assist in disseminating them. The\r\nliberation of the conidia is occasionally effected by the complete\r\nshrinking away of the conidiophore, but more frequently by abstriction\r\nfrom the conidiophores, either by their gradually tapering to a point,\r\nor by the dissolution of a cross-wall (generally of a mucilaginous\r\nnature). The individual links of conidia-chains are detached from\r\none another in the same way, or often by means of small, intercalary\r\ncells, which are formed at the base of the individual links, and\r\nbecoming slimy, dissolve upon the maturity of the spores. Special\r\ncontrivances for ejecting the spores and conidia may often be found.\r\nIn _Peronospora_ the cylindrical fruit-hyphæ in the dry condition\r\nbecome strap-shaped and also twisted. These are very hygroscopic,\r\nand the changes of form take place so suddenly, that the spores are\r\nviolently detached and shot away. In _Empusa_ a peculiar squirting\r\nmechanism may be found (Fig. 85). Each club-shaped hypha which projects\r\nfrom the body of the fly, bears a conidium at its apex; a vacuole,\r\nwhich grows gradually larger, is formed in the slimy contents of the\r\nhypha, and the pressure thereby eventually becomes so great that the\r\nhypha bursts at its apex, and the conidium is shot into the air. By\r\na similar mechanism, the spores of many of the Agaricaceæ are cast\r\naway from the parent-plants. In the case of _Pilobolus_ (Fig. 84)\r\nthe entire sporangium is thrown for some distance into the air by a\r\nsimilar contrivance, the basal region of the sporangium having, by\r\nthe absorption of water, been transformed into a slimy layer which\r\nis readily detached. _Sphærobolus_, a Gasteromycete, has a small,\r\nspherical fruit-body (basidiocarp), the covering of which, when ripe,\r\nsuddenly bursts, and the basidiospores contained in it are forcibly\r\nejected.\r\n\r\n_The spores which are enclosed in asci_ are, in some instances, set\r\nfree from the mother-cell (ascus) prior to their complete development\r\n(_Elaphomyces_, _Eurotium_). In the case of the majority of the\r\nPyrenomycetes and Truffles, the asci swell by the absorption of water\r\ninto a slimy mass, which gradually disappears, so that the spores lie\r\nfree in the fruit-body; they either remain there till the fruit-body\r\ndecays, as in those which have no aperture (Perisporiaceæ, Tuberaceæ),\r\nor the slimy mass, by its growth, is forced out through the aperture of\r\nthe sporocarp, taking the spores with it (_Nectria_). The ejection of\r\nthe spores by mechanical means takes place in a number of Ascomycetes,\r\nand should many spores be simultaneously ejected, a dust-cloud may be\r\nseen with the naked eye to arise in the air from the fruit-body. This\r\nis the case in the larger species of _Peziza_, _Helvella_, _Rhytisma_,\r\nwhen suddenly exposed to a damp current of air. A distinction is\r\ndrawn between a simultaneous ejection of all the spores contained\r\nin the ascus, and an ejection at intervals (successive), when only\r\none spore at a time is thrown out. The first of these methods is the\r\nmost frequent, and is brought about by the ascus being lined with a\r\nlayer of protoplasm, which absorbs water to such a degree that the\r\nelastic walls are extended at times to double their original size. The\r\nspores are forced up against the free end of the ascus, a circular\r\nrupture is made at this point, and the elastic walls contract, so\r\nthat the fluid with the spores is ejected. Special means may in some\r\ninstances be found to keep the spores together, and compel their\r\nsimultaneous ejection. Thus, a tough slime may surround all the\r\nspores (_Saccobolus_), or a chain-apparatus, similarly formed of tough\r\nslime; or there may be a hooked appendage from each end of the spores\r\nwhich hooks into the appendage of the next spore (_Sordaria_). The\r\nparaphyses occurring between the asci in many Ascomycetes, also play a\r\npart in the distribution of the spores, by reason of the pressure they\r\nexercise. The asci in some of the Pyrenomycetes, which are provided\r\nwith jar-shaped fruit-bodies, elongate to such an extent that, without\r\nbecoming detached from their bases, they reach the mouth of the\r\nfruit-body one at a time, burst and disperse their spores, and so make\r\nroom for those succeeding. An ejection of the spores at intervals from\r\nthe ascus is rarer. It takes place, for instance, in _Pleospora_, whose\r\nasci have a double wall. The external wall, by absorption of water,\r\nat last becomes ruptured, and the internal and more elastic membrane\r\nforces itself out in the course of a few seconds to one of two or three\r\ntimes greater length and thickness, so that one spore after another is\r\nforcibly ejected from a narrow aperture at the end of the ascus.\r\n\r\n=Germination of spores= (conidia and chlamydospores). In many spores\r\nmay be found one or more _germ-pores_, _i.e._ thinner places, either\r\nin the inner membrane (uredospores, _Sordaria_) or in the external\r\nmembrane (teleutospores in Rust-Fungi), through which the germination\r\ntakes place. Generally this does not occur till the spores have been\r\nset free: in some Ascomycetes germination commences inside the ascus\r\n(_Taphrina_, _Sclerotinia_). The different ways in which the spores\r\ngerminate may be classified into three groups.\r\n\r\nI. THE ORDINARY GERMINATION occurs by the spore emitting a germ-tube,\r\nwhich immediately developes into a mycelium. In spores with a double\r\nwall it is only the inner membrane which forms the germ-tube. In\r\nswarmspores a single wall is formed after the withdrawal of the cilia,\r\nand this, by direct elongation, becomes the germ-tube. The protoplasm\r\naccumulated in the spore enters the hypha, which, in pure water, can\r\nonly grow as long as the reserve nourishment lasts.\r\n\r\n=2.= GERMINATION WITH PROMYCELIUM differs only by the circumstance that\r\nthe hypha developed from the germ-tube has a very limited growth, and\r\nhence it does not immediately develope into a mycelium, but produces\r\nconidia (Rust-and Brand-Fungi). This promycelium must only be regarded\r\nas an advanced development of a conidiophore or basidium.\r\n\r\n=3.= THE YEAST-FORMATION of conidia consists in the production of\r\noutgrowths, very much constricted at their bases, from one or more\r\nplaces. Each of the conidia formed in this manner may again germinate\r\nin the same way. When sufficient nourishment is present, a branched\r\nchain of such conidia is formed, and these are finally detached\r\nfrom one another. Yeast-like buddings from the conidia are produced\r\nin various Fungi, _e.g. Ascoidea_, _Protomyces_, Ustilagineæ,\r\nAscomycetes, Tremellaceæ, etc. In the Ustilagineæ these conidia are\r\nan important element in the development. The budding conidia of\r\n_Exobasidium_ forms a “mould” on the nutritive solution. The yeast-like\r\nconidia are not to be confounded with the “Mucor-yeast” (comp.\r\nMucoraceæ). For _Saccharomyces_ see Appendix to the Fungi, page 176.\r\n\r\nIn a compound spore (_i.e._ when a mass of spores are associated\r\ntogether) each spore germinates on its own account. There are\r\nsometimes, however, certain among them which do not germinate, but\r\nyield their contents to those which do.\r\n\r\nThe _length of time_ for which conidia can retain their power of\r\ngermination is shortest (being only a few weeks) in those having\r\nthin walls and containing a large supply of water (Peronosporaceæ,\r\nUredinaceæ). In many spores a resting period is absolutely necessary\r\nbefore they are able to germinate (resting spores). It has been\r\nobserved in some spores and conidia, that the faculty of germinating\r\nmay be preserved for several years if the conditions necessary for\r\ngermination remain absent (Ustilagineæ, _Eurotium_, _Penicillium_).\r\n\r\nThe optimum, minimum and maximum temperatures required for the\r\ngermination of the spores has been decided in the case of a good many\r\nFungi. A large portion of the most common Fungi have their optimum at\r\n20°C., minimum at 1–2°C, maximum at 40°C. In the case of pathogenic\r\nFungi the optimum is adapted to the temperature of the blood. Fungi\r\nliving in manure, whose spores are often adapted to germinate in\r\nthe alimentary canals of warm-blooded animals, have an optimum\r\ncorresponding to the temperature of these animals, but with a little\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\n=Systematic Division.=--The lowest class of the Fungi is that of the\r\nPHYCOMYCETES, which have an unicellular mycelium, sexual and asexual\r\nreproduction, and have doubtless sprung from sporangia-bearing, lower\r\nGreen Algæ. From the Phycomycetes (and certainly from the Zygomycetes)\r\nspring two well defined branches, each with numerous distinct species;\r\nto the one branch belong the HEMIASCI and the ASCOMYCETES, to the other\r\nthe HEMIBASIDII and the BASIDIOMYCETES. Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes\r\nmay be united under the title of MYCOMYCETES or HIGHER FUNGI. The\r\nHemiasci and the Hemibasidii constitute the class of MESOMYCETES.\r\nThe Hemiasci are an intermediate form between Zygomycetes and\r\nAscomycetes; the Hemibasidii a similar group between the Zygomycetes\r\nand Basidiomycetes. Mesomycetes and Mycomycetes have only asexual\r\nreproduction; sexual reproduction is wanting. Their mycelium is\r\nmulticellular.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time about 39,000 species have been described.\r\n\r\nReview of the divisions of the Fungi:--\r\n\r\n    Class I.--=Phycomycetes (Algal-Fungi).=\r\n\r\n        Sub-Class 1. =Zygomycetes.=\r\n        Sub-Class 2. =Oomycetes.=\r\n           Family 1.

The mycelium is formed of a single cell, often\r\nthread-like and abundantly branched (Fig. 78). Vegetative propagation\r\nby chlamydospores and oidia. Asexual reproduction by endospores\r\n(sometimes _swarmspores_) and conidia. Sexual reproduction by\r\nconjugation of two hyphæ as in the Conjugatæ, or by fertilisation of an\r\negg-cell in an oogonium. On this account the class of the Phycomycetes\r\nis divided into two sub-classes: ZYGOMYCETES and OOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Sub-Class I. =Zygomycetes.=\r\n\r\nSexual reproduction takes place by zygospores, which function as\r\nresting-spores, and arise in consequence of _conjugation_ (Fig. 81); in\r\nthe majority of species these are rarely found, and only under special\r\nconditions. The most common method of reproduction is by endospores, by\r\nacrogenous conidia, by chlamydospores, or by oidia. _Swarmspores are\r\nwanting._ Parasites and saprophytes (order 6 and 7). The zygospores are\r\ngenerally produced when the formation of sporangia has ceased; _e.g._\r\nby the suppression of the sporangial-hyphæ (_Mucor mucedo_), or by\r\nthe diminution of oxygen; _Pilobolus crystallinus_ forms zygospores,\r\nwhen the sporangia are infected with saprophytic _Piptocephalis_ or\r\n_Pleotrachelus_.\r\n\r\n=A.= Asexual reproduction only by sporangia.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Mucoraceæ.= The spherical sporangia contain many spores.\r\nThe zygospore is formed between two unicellular branches (gametes).\r\n\r\nThe unicellular mycelium (Fig. 78) of the Mucoraceæ branches\r\nabundantly, and lives, generally, as a saprophyte on all sorts of\r\ndead organic remains. Some of these Fungi are known to be capable of\r\nproducing _alcoholic fermentation_, in common with the Saccharomyces.\r\nThis applies especially to _Chlamydomucor racemosus_ (_Mucor\r\nracemosus_), when grown in a saccharine solution, and deprived of\r\noxygen; the mycelium, under such conditions, becomes divided by\r\ntransverse walls into a large number of small cells. Many of these\r\nswell out into spherical or club-shaped cells, and when detached from\r\none another become chlamydospores, which abstrict new cells of similar\r\nnature (Fig. 79). These chlamydospores were formerly erroneously\r\ntermed “mucor-yeast,” but they must not be confounded with the\r\nyeast-conidia (page 94). They are shortened hyphæ, and are not conidia\r\nof definite size, shape, and point of budding. Oidia are also found in\r\n_Chlamydomucor_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 78.--_Mucor mucedo._ A mycelium which has\r\n  sprung from one spore, whose position is marked by the *: _a_,\r\n  _b_, _c_ are three sporangia in different stages of development;\r\n  _a_ is the youngest one, as yet only a short, thick, erect\r\n  branch; _b_ is commencing to form a sporangium which is larger in\r\n  _c_, but not yet separated from its stalk.]\r\n\r\nThe Mucoraceæ, in addition to the chlamydospores and oidia, have a more\r\nnormal and ordinary method of reproduction; viz., by _spores_ which\r\nare formed without any sexual act. _Mucor_ has round sporangia; from\r\nthe mycelium one or more long branches, sometimes several centimetres\r\nin length, grow vertically into the air; the apex swells (Figs. 78,\r\n80) into a sphere which soon becomes separated from its stalk by a\r\ntransverse wall; in the interior of this sphere (sporangium) a number\r\nof spores are formed which eventually are set free by the rupture of\r\nthe wall. The transverse wall protrudes into the sporangium and forms\r\nthe well-known columella (Fig. 80 _d_, _e_). The formation of spores\r\ntakes place in various ways among the different genera.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 79.--Chlamydospores of _Chlamydomucor\r\n  racemosus_ (× 375 times.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 80.--_Mucor mucedo_: _a_ a spore commencing\r\n  to germinate (× 300 times); _b_ a germinating spore which has\r\n  formed a germ-tube from each end (× 300 times); _c_ the apex of\r\n  a young sporangium before the formation of spores has commenced;\r\n  the stalk is protruded in the sporangium in the form of a column:\r\n  on the wall of the sporangium is found a very fine incrustation\r\n  of lime in the form of thorn-like projections; _d_ a sporangium\r\n  in which the formation of spores has commenced; _e_ a sporangium,\r\n  the wall of which is ruptured, leaving a remnant attached to the\r\n  base of the columella as a small collar. A few spores are seen\r\n  still adhering to the columella.]\r\n\r\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION by conjugation takes place in the following\r\nmanner. The ends of two hyphæ meet (Fig. 81) and become more or less\r\nclub-shaped; the ends of each of these are cut off by a cell-wall, and\r\ntwo new small cells (Fig. 81 _A_) are thus formed, these coalesce and\r\ngive rise to a new cell which becomes the very thick-walled zygote\r\n(zygospore), and germinates after period of rest, producing a new\r\nhypha, which bears a sporangium (Fig. 81 _E_).\r\n\r\n_Mucor mucedo_, Pin-mould, resembles somewhat in appearance\r\n_Penicillium crustaceum_ and is found growing upon various organic\r\nmaterials (bread, jam, dung, etc.).\r\n\r\n_Pilobolus_ (Figs. 83, 84) grows on manure. Its sporangium (Fig. 84\r\n_a″_) is formed during the night and by a peculiar mechanism (page 92)\r\nis shot away from the plant in the course of the day. This generally\r\ntakes place in the summer, between eight and ten a.m. The sporangium is\r\nshot away to a height which may be 300 times greater than that of the\r\nplant itself, and by its stickiness it becomes attached to portions of\r\nplants, etc., which are in the vicinity. If these are eaten by animals,\r\nthe spores pass into the alimentary canal and are later on, sometimes\r\neven in a germinating condition, passed out with the excrement, in\r\nwhich they form new mycelia.\r\n\r\n_Phycomyces nitens_ (“Oil-mould”) is the largest of the Mould Fungi;\r\nits sporangiophores may attain the height of 10–30 c.m.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Rhizopaceæ.= _Rhizopus nigricans_ (_Mucor stolonifer_) which\r\nlives on decaying fruits containing sugar, on bread, etc., has, at the\r\nbase of the sporangiophores, tufts of rhizoids, _i.e._ hyphæ, which\r\nfunction as organs of attachment. From these, “runners” are produced\r\nwhich in a similar manner develope sporangiophores and rhizoids.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 81, 82.--_Mucor mucedo_: _A-C_ stages in the\r\n  formation of the zygote; D zygote; E germination of zygote: the\r\n  exospore has burst, and the endospore grown into a hypha bearing\r\n  a sporangium.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Thamnidiaceæ.= On the same sporangiophore, in addition to\r\na large, terminal, many-spored sporangium, many smaller, lateral\r\nsporangia are formed with a few spores.

The zygospore arises at the\r\nsummit of the conjugating hyphæ, which are curved so as to resemble a\r\npair of tongs. _Piptocephalis_ and _Syncephalis_ live parasitically on\r\nthe larger Mucoraceæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Sub-Class 2. =Oomycetes.=\r\n\r\nSexual reproduction is oogamous with the formation of brown,\r\nthick-walled _oospores_ which germinate after a period of rest.\r\nAsexual reproduction by conidia and _swarmspores_. Parasites, seldom\r\nsaprophytes.\r\n\r\nThe oospores are large spores which are formed from the egg-cell\r\n(oosphere) of the _oogonium_ (oosporangium, Fig. 89, 95). A branch of\r\nthe mycelium attaches itself to the oogonium and forms at its apex\r\nthe so-called “_antheridium_” (pollinodium[13]): this sends one or\r\nmore slender prolongations (fertilising tubes) through the wall of the\r\noogonium to the egg-cell.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 85.--_Empusa muscæ_ (Fly-mould). I. A fly\r\n  killed by the fungus, surrounded by a white layer of conidia. II.\r\n  The conidiophores (_t_) projecting from the body of the fly.

Fertilisation of the egg-cell by means of self-motile\r\n   _spermatozoids_ is only found in _Monoblepharis sphærica_.\r\n\r\n=A.= Asexual reproduction by conidia only.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Family 1. =Entomophthorales.=\r\n\r\nThe mycelium is richly branched. The family is a transitional step to\r\nthe conidia-bearing Zygomycetes, since the oospores of many members of\r\nthis family arise, and are formed, like zygospores.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Entomophthoraceæ.= Mycelium abundantly developed. This\r\nmost frequently lives parasitically in living insects, causing their\r\ndeath. The conidiophores forming the conidial-layer project from the\r\nskin, and abstrict a proportionately large conidium which is ejected\r\nwith considerable force, and by this means transferred to other\r\ninsects. These become infected by the entrance of the germ-tube into\r\ntheir bodies. The spherical, brown resting-spores develope inside the\r\nbodies of insects and germinate by emitting a germ-tube.\r\n\r\n   GENERA: _Empusa_ has a good many species which are parasitic\r\n   on flies, moths, grasshoppers, plant-lice. The conidia emit a\r\n   germ-tube which pierces the skin of the insect; a number of\r\n   secondary conidia are then produced inside its body, by division\r\n   or by gemmation similar to that taking place in yeast, each\r\n   of which grows and becomes a long unbranched hypha, and these\r\n   eventually fill up the body of the animal, causing distension\r\n   and death. Each of these hyphæ projects through the skin,\r\n   and abstricts a conidium, which is ejected by a squirting\r\n   contrivance. The best known species is _E. muscæ_ (Fig. 85),\r\n   which makes its appearance epidemically towards autumn on the\r\n   common house-fly, and shows itself by the dead flies which are\r\n   found on the windows and walls attached by their probosces,\r\n   distended wings, and legs. They have swollen abdomen, broad\r\n   white belts of hyphæ between the abdominal rings, and are\r\n   surrounded by a circle of whitish dust formed by the ejected\r\n   conidia.--_Entomophthora_ sends out, at definite places, from\r\n   the mycelium hidden in the insect’s body, bundles of hyphæ,\r\n   which serve the purpose of holding fast the dead insects, the\r\n   ramifications attaching themselves to the substratum: the\r\n   conidiophores are branched, the conidia are ejected by the\r\n   divisional walls between the hyphæ and the conidia dividing into\r\n   two layers, those which terminate the hyphæ suddenly expanding\r\n   and throwing the conidia into the air. _E. radicans_ makes its\r\n   appearance epidemically on caterpillars.\r\n\r\n=B.= Asexual reproduction by zoospores or conidia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 2. =Chytridiales.=\r\n\r\nIn this family the mycelium is very sparsely developed or is\r\nwanting. The entire plant consists principally or entirely of a\r\nsingle zoosporangium whose zoospores have generally one cilium. The\r\nresting-spores arise either directly from the zoosporangium, which,\r\ninstead of forming zoospores, surrounds itself by a thick cell-wall; or\r\nthey are formed by the conjugation of two cells (in which case they are\r\nspoken of as oospores). Microscopic Fungi, parasitic on water plants\r\n(especially Algæ) or small aquatic animals, seldom on land plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Olpidiaceæ.= Without mycelium. Swarmspores and\r\nresting-spores.\r\n\r\n   In the _Olpidieæ_, the swarmspores, probably, most frequently\r\n   form themselves into a plasmodium (naked mass of protoplasm)\r\n   which may become a single zoosporangium or a resting sporangium.\r\n   _Olpidium trifolii_ occurs in _Trifolium repens_.--In the\r\n   _Synchytrieæ_ the plasmodium emerging from the swarmspores\r\n   breaks up either at once, or after a period of rest, into\r\n   smaller plasmodia, each of which will become a zoosporangium.\r\n   _Synchytrium anemones_ is found on _Anemone nemorosa_; _S.\r\n   mercurialis_ on _Mercurialis perennis_; _S. aureum_ on many\r\n   plants, particularly _Lysimachia nummularia_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 86.--_Chytridium lagenula._ Zoosporangium _a_\r\n  before, _b_ after the liberation of the swarmspores.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 87.--_Obelidium mucronatum_: _m_ mycelium;\r\n  _s_ swarmspores.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Rhizidiaceæ.= Mycelium present. Zoospores and\r\nresting-spores.\r\n\r\n   _Chytridium_ (Fig. 86). _Obelidium_ (Fig. 87) is bicellular; the\r\n   one cell is the mycelium, the other the zoosporangium; found\r\n   on insects. The species of _Cladochytrium_ are intercellular\r\n   parasites on marsh plants. _Physoderma._\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Zygochytriaceæ.= Mycelium present. Zoospores and oospores.\r\nThe latter are the product of the conjugation of two cells (Fig. 88).\r\n\r\n   _Polyphagus euglenæ_ on _Euglena viridis_. _Urophlyctis pulposa_\r\n   on species of _Chenopodium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 3. =Mycosiphonales.=\r\n\r\nThe mycelium is bladder-like or branched. Zoospores. Sexual\r\nreproduction by oospores, which are produced in oogonia. The latter are\r\nfertilised, in some forms, by the antheridium.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Ancylistaceæ.= The entire bladder-like mycelium\r\n   is used for the construction of zoosporangia, oogonia, or\r\n   antheridia. _Lagenedium_ is parasitic on _Spirogyra_, etc.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Peronosporaceæ.= Almost entirely _parasites_. The\r\nunicellular, often very long and abundantly branched mycelium lives\r\nin the intercellular spaces of living plants, especially in the\r\ngreen portions, and these are more or less destroyed and deformed in\r\nconsequence. Special small branches (_suction-organs_, “_haustoria_”)\r\nare pushed into the cells in order to abstract nourishment from them.\r\nBoth oospores and conidia germinate either immediately, or they\r\ndevelope into sporangia with swarmspores, having always two cilia. Only\r\none oospore is formed in each oogonium; its contents (Fig. 89) divide\r\ninto a centrally placed egg-cell and the “periplasm” surrounding it;\r\nthis is of a paler colour and on the maturity of the oospore forms its\r\nthick, brown, external covering.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 88.--_Polyphagus euglenæ. A_ with smooth,\r\n  _B_ with thorny oospores; _m_ and _f_ the two conjugating cells.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 89.--_Peronospora alsinearum._ Mycelium with\r\n  egg-cell and antheridium.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 90.--_Phytophthora infestans_ (strongly\r\n  magnified). Cross section through a small portion of a\r\n  Potato-leaf (the under side turned upwards): _a_ the mycelium; _b\r\n  b_ two conidiophores projecting through a stoma; _c_ conidia; _e_\r\n  the spongy tissue of the leaf; _g_ the epidermis.]\r\n\r\n_The Potato-fungus_ (_Phytophthora infestans_) is of great interest.\r\nIts thallus winters in the Potato-tuber; other organs for passing the\r\nwinter, such as oospores, are not known. When the tuber germinates, the\r\nFungus-hyphæ penetrate the young shoot and keep pace with the aerial\r\ngrowth and development of the plant. The conidiophores emerge through\r\nthe stomata, especially on the under side of the leaves; they branch\r\nlike a tree (Fig. 90), and appear to the naked eye as a fine mould on\r\nthe surface of the plant. The disease soon makes itself known by the\r\nbrown colouring of those parts of the plant which are attacked, and by\r\ntheir withering. An ovoid conidium arises at first by the formation of\r\na dividing wall at the apex of each branch of the conidiophore (Fig. 90\r\n_c c_), and immediately underneath it another is formed, which pushes\r\nthe first to one side, and so on. These conidia sometimes germinate\r\ndirectly, and form a mycelium, but most frequently their protoplasm\r\ndivides into many small masses, each of which becomes a pear-shaped\r\nzoospore provided with two cilia (Fig. 91). Water is required for\r\ntheir germination, and when the ripe conidia are placed in a drop of\r\nwater the swarm-cells are formed in the course of about five hours.\r\nThey swarm about in rain and dewdrops in the Potato-fields, and are\r\ncarried with the water to the Potato-plants and to the tubers in\r\nthe soil. The wind also very easily conveys the conidia to healthy\r\nPotato-fields and infects them. The enormous quantity of conidia and\r\nswarm-cells that may be formed in the course of a summer explains the\r\nrapid spreading of the disease; and the preceding makes it clear why\r\nwet summers are favourable to its existence. When the swarm-cells\r\ngerminate, they round off, and then surround themselves with a\r\ncell-wall which grows out into the germ-tube, and _pierces through the\r\nepidermis_ of the host-plant (Fig. 92). Having entered the host, a new\r\nmycelium is formed. The potato disease, since 1845, has been rampant in\r\nEurope; it has, no doubt, been introduced from America, which, it must\r\nbe remembered, is the home of the Potato-plant.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 91.--_Phytophthora infestans_: _a-c_ conidia\r\n  detached; in _c_ the swarm-cells are leaving the mother-cell; _d_\r\n  two free-swimming swarm-cells.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 92.--_Phytophthora infestans._ Cross section\r\n  through a portion of a Potato-stalk. Two germinating conidia\r\n  (_a_, _b_) piercing the epidermis, and the mycelium penetrating\r\n  the cells.]\r\n\r\n   The conidia exhibit various characters which are employed for\r\n   the separation of the genera. _Pythium_ is the most simple\r\n   form. The contents of the terminally-formed conidia emerge as\r\n   a spherical mass and divide into swarmspores. _P. de Baryanum_\r\n   lives in the seedlings of many different Flowering-plants,\r\n   which it completely destroys.--_Phytophthora_ is distinguished\r\n   by the circumstance that the sparsely-branched conidiophores\r\n   bear, sympodially, chains of conidia. Besides the Potato-fungus\r\n   (see above), _Ph. fagi_ belongs to this group; it developes\r\n   oospores very abundantly, and does great harm to seedlings of\r\n   the Beech, Sycamore, and Pine trees.--_Peronospora_ generally\r\n   has conidiophores which are repeatedly forked, and bear a\r\n   conidium on each of the most extreme ramifications. Many do\r\n   great harm to their host-plants. _P. viticola_, on Vines, and\r\n   _P. nivea_, on umbelliferous plants, have swarmspores, which are\r\n   absent in the following species of this genus: _P. sparsa_, on\r\n   Roses; _P. gangliformis_, on composites; _P. alsinearum_, on\r\n   Stitchwort; _P. parasitica_, on cruciferous plants; _P. viciæ_,\r\n   on Vetches and Peas; _P. schachtii_, on Beets; _P. violacea_,\r\n   on the flowers of _Scabiosa_; _P. radii_, on the ray-florets of\r\n   _Matricaria_.--_Cystopus_ (_Albugo_) has the conidia developed\r\n   in chains, which form a cohesive white layer underneath the\r\n   epidermis of the host-plant. _Cystopus candidus_, on cruciferous\r\n   plants, especially Shepherd’s Purse and _Brassica_; the\r\n   germination commences on the cotyledons, and from this point the\r\n   mycelium developes together with the host-plant; _C. cubicus_,\r\n   on the leaves of Compositæ.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 93.--A fly overgrown with _Saprolegnia_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 94.--Formation of swarmspores in a\r\n  _Saprolegnia_: a germinating swarmspores.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Saprolegniaceæ=, _Water-Fungi_ which live as saprophytes on\r\norganic remains lying in water, for instance, on dead flies (Fig. 93),\r\nworms, remains of plants; but they may also make their appearance on\r\nliving animals, being frequently found, for example, on the young trout\r\nin rearing establishments.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 95.--Oogonium with two antheridia, _Achlya\r\n  racemosa_.]\r\n\r\nThe thallus is a single, long and branched cell. It has one portion\r\nwhich serves as root, and lives in the substratum, where it ramifies\r\nabundantly for the purpose of absorbing nourishment; and another\r\nportion projecting freely in the water, and sending out hyphæ on all\r\nsides (Fig. 93). The asexual reproduction takes place by swarmspores\r\n(Fig. 94), which are developed in large sporangia; these swarmspores\r\ngenerally possess two cilia, and on germination grow into new plants.\r\nThe entire protoplasm in the oogonium is formed into one or more\r\noospheres, without any surrounding “periplasm.” The oospheres may not\r\nbe fertilised (p. 100), and then develope parthenogenetically.\r\n\r\n   Genera: _Saprolegnia_, whose swarmspores disperse immediately\r\n   after having left the sporangium. _S. ferax_ is the\r\n   cause of a disease in fish (“Salmon disease”) and in the\r\n   crayfish.--_Achlya_, whose swarmspores accumulate in a hollow\r\n   ball before the mouth of the sporangium.--_Leptomitus_ has\r\n   strongly indented hyphæ, causing a “linked” appearance.\r\n   _L. lacteus_ is frequent in the waste matter from sugar\r\n   factories.--_Monoblepharis_ deviates from the others by the\r\n   greater development of its fertilising process; the oosphere,\r\n   situated in an open oogonium, becoming fertilised by self-motile\r\n   spermatozoids, which are provided with a cilium at the posterior\r\n   end.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Class 2. =Mesomycetes.=\r\n\r\nThe Mesomycetes are intermediate forms between the Phycomycetes and\r\nthe Higher Fungi. In the vegetative organs, and in the multicellular\r\nhyphæ, they resemble the Higher Fungi; the methods of reproduction,\r\nhowever, show the characters of the Phycomycetes, namely sporangia\r\nand conidiophores of varying size and with varying number of spores;\r\ndefinite and typically formed asci and basidia are not present. Sexual\r\nreproduction is wanting. The HEMIASCI are transitional between the\r\nPhycomycetes and the Ascomycetes, the HEMIBASIDII (Brand-Fungi) form\r\nthe transition to the Basidiomycetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Sub-Class 1. =Hemiasci.=\r\n\r\nThe Hemiasci are Fungi with _sporangia_ which, _although resembling\r\nasci_, yet have _not_, however, _a definite form and a definite number\r\nof spores_. Besides endospores, conidia, chlamydospores and oidia are\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Ascoideaceæ.= _Ascoidea rubescens_ forms irregular,\r\n   reddish-brown masses in the sap issuing from felled Beeches. It\r\n   has _free sporangia_, which resemble asci in their structure, in\r\n   the development and ejection, and in the definite shape and size\r\n   of the spores. The formation of the sporangia takes place when\r\n   the nutriment is nearly exhausted, and resembles that of the\r\n   conidia, since they are developed from the end of a hypha which\r\n   enlarges, and the swelling becomes separated by a transverse\r\n   wall. Within the sporangia numerous spores of a cap-like form\r\n   are developed, which are set free through an opening at the\r\n   apex. Sporangia are formed successively at the apex of the\r\n   same hypha, the second commencing to develope as the first is\r\n   dehiscing. Conidia and sporangia are not formed simultaneously;\r\n   the former may be considered as closed sporangia.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Protomycetaceæ.= _Protomyces pachydermus_ causes\r\n   hard swellings on the stems and leaf-stalks of the Cichorieæ\r\n   (_Taraxacum_, etc.). These swellings consist of _chlamydospores_\r\n   (resting-spores), which germinate and become free, ascus-like\r\n   sporangia, with numerous small spores. In nutritive solutions\r\n   the chlamydospores form conidia with yeast-like buddings. _P.\r\n   macrosporus_ on _Ægopodium_, and other Umbelliferæ.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Thelebolaceæ.= _Thelebolus stercoreus_, is found\r\n   on the dung of deer, hares, and rabbits, and has _closed\r\n   sporangia_, which resemble asci in their shape and regular\r\n   construction, and in the ejection of spores. The covering\r\n   encloses only one sporangium, even where the sporangia arise\r\n   close together.\r\n\r\nThis order, by reason of the covering of the sporangia, forms the\r\ntransition from the Hemiasci to the Carpoasci, while the two first\r\nsupply an intermediate step to the Exoasci.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Sub-Class 2. =Hemibasidii, Brand-Fungi.=\r\n\r\nThe Brand-Fungi (also known as USTILAGINEÆ) are Fungi with\r\n_basidia-like conidiophores_, which, however, have not yet advanced\r\nto a definite form or number of conidia. They are true parasites,\r\nwhose mycelium spreads itself in the intercellular spaces of Flowering\r\nplants. The mycelium is colourless, quickly perishable, has transverse\r\nwalls at some distance from each other (Fig. 96), and sends out\r\nhaustoria into the cells of the host-plant.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 96.--_Entyloma ranunculi._ 1. Cross section\r\n  of a portion of a leaf of _Ficaria_ permeated by the mycelium; a\r\n  bundle of hyphæ with conidia emerging from a stoma; in one of the\r\n  cells are found four brand-spores. 2. A brand-spore developed in\r\n  the middle of a hypha.]\r\n\r\nIt most frequently happens that the germ-tube enters the host-plant at\r\nits most tender age, that is, during the germination of the seed; the\r\nmycelium then wanders about in the tissues of the shoot during its\r\ngrowth, until it reaches that part of the plant where the spores are to\r\nbe formed. The spore-formation takes place in the same way in all those\r\nspecies whose brand-spores are developed in the floral parts of the\r\nhost-plant. Many Brand-Fungi have, however, a more local occurrence,\r\nand the mycelium is restricted to a smaller area of the leaf or stem.\r\nThose organs of the host-plant in which the brand-spores are developed\r\noften become strongly hypertrophied. In perennial plants the mycelium\r\nwinters very often in the rhizome.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 97.--_Doassansia alismatis._ 1. A fruit-body,\r\n  formed by a covering of oblong hyphæ, which encloses a mass\r\n  of brand-spores, and is embedded in the leaf-tissue of the\r\n  host-plant; 20 times natural size. 2. A germinating brand-spore,\r\n  500 times natural size. 3. Three connected resting-spores, 400\r\n  times natural size. 4. Two conidia grown together, 600 times\r\n  natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe brand-spores are the winter resting-spores of the Brand-Fungi.\r\nThey arise in the tissues of the host-plant, which is often destroyed,\r\nand become free through the rupture of the epidermis; they are\r\nthick-walled, generally brown or violet, and very often possess warts,\r\nspines, or reticulate markings. Fruit-bodies, that is enclosed organs\r\nof reproduction, are found in few genera (_Sphacelotheca_, _Graphiola_;\r\n_Doassansia_, Fig. 97). In _Tolyposporium_, _Tuburcinia_, _Thecaphora_\r\n(Fig. 102), etc., the brand-spores are united into a _ball of spores_.\r\nOn germination the brand-spores behave as _chlamydospores_, namely,\r\nas the fundament of conidiophores, by emitting a short germ-tube,\r\n_i.e._ a conidiophore (“promycelium”). The USTILAGINACEÆ (Fig. 99, 2)\r\nhave a short _transversely divided_ conidiophore, with _laterally_\r\ndeveloped conidia (comp. the basidia of the Protobasidiomycetes).\r\nThe conidiophores of the TILLETIACEÆ are undivided (unicellular\r\npromycelia), and bear the conidia terminally, and so resemble the\r\nbasidia of the Autobasidiomycetes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 98.--_Tuburcinia._ 1. _T. trientalis._ Hyphæ,\r\n  some of which bear conidia at the apex, forcing themselves out\r\n  between the epidermal cells on the under side of the leaf; 320\r\n  times natural size. 2. _T. trientalis._ A ball of spores in which\r\n  some of the individual brand-spores are about to germinate; 520\r\n  times natural size. 3. _T. primulicola_: various forms of conidia\r\n  (500 times natural size).]\r\n\r\n   In _Tilletia_, _Entyloma_, _Neovossia_, _Tuburcinia_, the\r\n   brand-spores germinate and form basidia-like conidiophores with\r\n   spindle-shaped conidia; their mycelium, on the other hand,\r\n   produces later only single, sickle-shaped conidia, so that\r\n   two kinds of conidia are found, as in a few Basidiomycetes.\r\n   In some species, _e.g. Ustilago hordei_, the brand-spores\r\n   only germinate vegetatively and form a mycelium. In nutritive\r\n   solutions (solutions of dung, etc.) where they live as\r\n   _saprophytes_, the brand-spores of many species emit germ-tubes,\r\n   and on these, _yeast-like conidia_ are produced by repeated\r\n   budding, which grow into mycelia only when the nutritive\r\n   solution is exhausted. These conidia have not the power of\r\n   producing alcoholic fermentation. The very numerous conidia,\r\n   which are found in the dung of herbivorous animals, are probably\r\n   the yeast-conidia of Brand-Fungi. The brand-spores, which are\r\n   eaten by animals with the grain and hay, pass into the dung\r\n   and without doubt give rise to a very rich multiplication of\r\n   yeast-conidia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 99.--_Ustilago._ 1.

This\r\n   union in pairs does not, however, take place with a view to\r\n   germination, there is no fusion of nuclei, and therefore in this\r\n   “fusion” there is no sexual act.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Ustilaginaceæ.= Conidiophores with transverse walls\r\n   and lateral conidia.--_Ustilago_ (Fig. 99) generally developes\r\n   its spores in the floral organs of its host-plant, the ovary or\r\n   anthers, where they arise from hyphæ, and form a slimy mass\r\n   which when mature becomes a black dust.\r\n\r\n   To this order belong _U. avenæ_, parasitic on Oats, _U. hordei_\r\n   and _U. nuda_ (_U. jenseni_), on Barley; these are the usual\r\n   cause of “Smut” on cereals. _U. hypodytes_ on straw of _Elymus_\r\n   and _Agropyrum_. _U. filiformis_ in the leaves of _Glyceria_.\r\n   _U. caricis_ transforms the fruits of various species of\r\n   _Carex_ into black, dusty balls. _U. violacea_ developes its\r\n   violet spore-powder in the anthers of the Caryophyllaceæ.\r\n   _U. tragopogonis_, transforms entire inflorescences of\r\n   _Tragopogon_ into a black-violet mass. Among the largest are _U.\r\n   grandis_, which causes the large swollen nodes in the stem of\r\n   _Phragmites_, and the Maize Blight, _U. maydis_, which produces\r\n   outgrowths about the size of a hand on the spadix of the Maize.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Tilletiaceæ.= Conidiophores undivided, generally\r\n   several conidia arise at their apices.--_Tilletia tritici_,\r\n   the _Stinkbrand on Wheat_ (Fig. 100). The mycelium lives in\r\n   Wheat-plants, producing its spores in the ovary after the whole\r\n   interior of this body has been destroyed by the mycelium, with\r\n   the exception of the external layer of the wall of the ovary,\r\n   which remains essentially unaltered and encloses the closely\r\n   packed, firm mass of spores (Fig. 100 _d_). The grains of Wheat\r\n   thus attacked are shorter and thicker than the sound ones,\r\n   and the ears show the presence of this Fungus by their erect\r\n   position, and the wide separation of the chaff (Fig. 100 _a_).\r\n   The unpleasant odour of the ovary prior to the ripening of the\r\n   spores, has given the name “Stinkbrand,” and, in like manner,\r\n   its hardness when it encloses the ripe spores, is the reason\r\n   of its being also called “Stonebrand.” On account of this\r\n   hardness, the diseased grains are readily harvested together\r\n   with the healthy ones, which become infected by the spores at\r\n   the threshing. _T. lævis_ (_T. fœtens_) also occurs on Wheat and\r\n   has smooth brand-spores.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 101.--_Urocystis._ 1, _U. covalloides_.\r\n  A spore-ball, magnified 450 times. 2–4, _U. anemones_: 2–3,\r\n  brand-spores which are about to germinate (magnified 450 times).\r\n  4, Conidia, the two in a state of fusion, a third with vacuoles\r\n  and division-wall, magnified 500 times.]\r\n\r\n   _Entyloma_ (Fig. 96), a genus with numerous species, which\r\n   appear in spots on the leaves of the host-plant, and\r\n   _Tuburcinia_ (Fig. 98), which makes its appearance on the\r\n   Primulaceæ, produce white conidia-spots on the surface of the\r\n   host-plant. The first-named has single spores, the latter has\r\n   its spores closely massed together.--_Urocystis_ (Fig. 101)\r\n   has its spores surrounded by a number of small and lighter\r\n   coloured barren spores. _U. occulta_, Rye-stem Blight, forms\r\n   its spores in long streaks in the stems and leaves of the Rye,\r\n   and does considerable damage. _U. cepulæ_ on Onions. _U. violæ_\r\n   forms large dark-violet swellings in the leaf-stalk and stems\r\n   of Violets.--_Thecaphora_ (Fig. 102) appears in seedlings of\r\n   _Convolvulus_ and _Astragalus_.\r\n\r\n   As a means of protection against the Smut-Fungi which make their\r\n   appearance on the different cereals, a submersion of the grains\r\n   in a solution of blue vitriol (½%) for twelve hours, or better\r\n   still, submerging for five minutes in water heated to 53–55° _C_\r\n   (Jensen’s method) is employed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 102.--_Thecaphora._ 1, _T. convolvuli_, a\r\n  ball of spores, one of the brand-spores has emitted a septate\r\n  branched conidiophore (× 520). 2, _T. affinis_, a ball of spores\r\n  (× 520).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Class 3. =Mycomycetes, Higher Fungi.=\r\n\r\nThe MYCOMYCETES are not entirely aquatic in habit; they have hyphæ with\r\n_transverse walls_, but _no sexual reproductive organs_. The asexual\r\nreproduction takes place in very different ways; by endospores (in\r\nasci), conidia, basidiospores, chlamydospores, and oidia. Swarmspores\r\nare never found.\r\n\r\nTwo chief methods of reproduction may be distinguished, and hence the\r\nclass may be divided into two large sub-classes:--the ASCOMYCETES (with\r\nasci), and the BASIDIOMYCETES (with basidia).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Sub-Class 1. =Ascomycetes.=\r\n\r\nThe main characteristic which distinguishes the Ascomycetes is the\r\n_ascus_; a name given to a sporangium of a definite shape and size,\r\nand containing a definite number of spores. The shape is generally\r\nclub-like or spherical, the number of spores 8 (in some 2, 4, 16 or\r\nmore), see Figs. 103, 105, 108, 110, 113, 116, 120, 121, 123, 129.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest forms, the EXOASCI, the ascus springs directly from the\r\nmycelium without the formation of a fruit-body (_i.e._ ascocarp).\r\nIn the higher forms, which contain many species, the CARPOASCI, the\r\nasci are united and form ascocarps which may be more or less enclosed\r\n(angiocarpic, hemiangiocarpic, and probably gymnocarpic).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 103.--Endogenous formation of spores in\r\n  _Peziza confluens_. In the youngest asci there is only one\r\n  nucleus (_b_, _e_); this divides into two (_f_); and the division\r\n  is repeated so that there are 4 nuclei in _c_ and 8 in _g_. These\r\n  surround themselves with protoplasm and a cell-wall (_h_, _i_).\r\n  The protoplasm of the mother-cell is not entirely used up.]\r\n\r\nThe hyphæ of the _Mycelium_ in some remain free, in others they are\r\nfelted together and form thick strands or flat, cushion-like bodies\r\n(compare in particular the stromata of the Pyrenomycetes). Some species\r\nform _sclerotia_ (Figs. 116, 128).\r\n\r\nAsexual reproduction by means of _conidia_ is known in many species\r\nas the principal means of reproduction, and the one which affords\r\nthe most rapid means of distribution. The conidia may be produced on\r\nconidiophores (Fig. 109), in conidial-layers (Fig. 122), and often in\r\nconidiocarps (pycnidia, Figs. 120 _d_, _e_; 123 _a_; 124 _b._). These\r\nlast occur partly as the so-called “spermogonia” (that is, pycnidia\r\nwith microconidia). The conidiophores never approach the basidia.\r\n\r\n   In many species the ascospores germinate and form conidia\r\n   immediately (_Nectria cinnabarina_, _Sclerotinia_, _Taphrina_,\r\n   etc.), sometimes while they are still in the ascus and before\r\n   their ejection (_Taphrina_, Fig. 105 _a_). In many instances\r\n   the conidia by means of continued budding can, for a longer\r\n   or shorter time, produce yeast-conidia, _e.g. Taphrina_. In\r\n   many other cases the conidia arise from the germ-tubes of the\r\n   ascospores, or at any part of the mycelium. The unripe asci\r\n   of _Taphrina_, when placed in water, develop conidia at their\r\n   apices. The _Sclerotinia_-species produce numerous conidia\r\n   whose germination has never been observed. The formation of\r\n   conidia and asci sometimes takes place on the same fruit-body.\r\n   In _Heterosphæria patella_ the conidia and asci are developed\r\n   successively in the same fruit-body; in the ascocarps of\r\n   _Dermatea frangula_ and _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ the formation\r\n   of conidia may take place. The ascocarps frequently arise\r\n   from the conidial-layers (_Nectria cinnabarina_, etc.). This\r\n   relationship of the two forms of reproduction to each other\r\n   may be explained by considering that both have descended\r\n   phylogenetically from sporangia.\r\n\r\nSometimes _chlamydospores_ and _oidia_ also appear in the Ascomycetes;\r\non germination, however, they do not, as in _Protomyces_, form\r\nsporangia, and on this account cannot be distinctly distinguished from\r\nconidia.\r\n\r\nThe asci are morphologically the highest form of reproduction and\r\nare always found at the close of the development of these Fungi; the\r\naccessory forms of reproduction are first developed, but a well-defined\r\nalternation of generations does not occur.\r\n\r\n   In the Ascomycetes there are more than 11,000 described species,\r\n   which can be classed as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Series 1.

One order.\r\n\r\nOrder. =Taphrinaceæ.= Of the genera belonging to this order,\r\n_Taphrina_, _Endomyces_, and _Ascocorticium_, the first is most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n   _Endomyces decipiens_ is a parasite in the fruit-body of\r\n   _Armillaria mellea_; _E. magnusii_ lives in the gelatinous,\r\n   fermenting exudations of Oak-trees; _Ascocorticium albidum_\r\n   is found under the bark of the Fir-tree. _Endomyces_ has\r\n   chlamydospores and oidia.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Taphrina_ are parasites, whose free asci may be found\r\nin great numbers, generally closely pressed together, on the parts of\r\nplants which they have attacked. The asci are developed directly from\r\nthe ascogenous cells of a fertile, generally sub-cuticular, hypha,\r\nwhich arises from the sterile mycelium. The latter arises from the\r\ngerminating ascospore, and may hibernate in the tissues of its host,\r\nparticularly in the winter buds, and then with the commencement of\r\nthe next period of vegetation it continues its growth side by side\r\nwith that of its host. The hyphæ ramify in the intercellular spaces or\r\nbeneath the cuticle, but have no haustoria. The ascospores (Fig. 105\r\n_A_) and unripe asci may produce conidia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 104.--_Taphrina_ (_Exoascus_) _pruni_.\r\n  Yeast-like budding of a germinating spore (× 600).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 105.--_Taphrina betulina_: _a_ ascus filled\r\n  with conidia; _b_ germinating spores (× 600).]\r\n\r\n   Very remarkable appearances, and swellings of the attacked\r\n   tissues, are produced when the mycelium is perennial; for\r\n   example, the “Witches’-brooms” and “Pockets.” The hard, hollow,\r\n   stoneless plums, known as “Pocket” or “Bladder” Plums, are\r\n   produced by considerable changes in the tissues of the fruit;\r\n   these are caused particularly by _T. pruni_ on several species\r\n   of _Prunus_. The “Witches’-brooms,” on the contrary, are\r\n   deformations of entire twigs or branches, and often attain\r\n   a very large size. They occur on _Alnus incana_, caused by\r\n   _T. epiphylla_; on _Carpinus betulus_, by _T. carpini_; on\r\n   Cherry-trees, by _T. cerasi_; on Plum-trees, by _T. insititiæ_;\r\n   on Birches, by _T. turgida_ and _T. betulina_. _T. deformans_\r\n   attacks the leaves of the Peach, and causes them to curl.\r\n\r\n   When a perennial mycelium is wanting, the infection is confined\r\n   as a rule to white or yellow spots on the leaves, _e.g._ the\r\n   commonest, _T. sadebeckii_, on _Alnus glutinosa_, and _T. aurea_\r\n   on species of _Populus_. _T. alni incanæ_ (Fig. 106) causes\r\n   considerable hypertrophies on the pistillate catkins of the\r\n   Alder, which may be compared to the “pockets” of _Prunus_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 106.--_Taphrina alni incanæ_ on the Alder\r\n  (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Series 2. =Carpoasci.=\r\n\r\nThe Carpoasci are Ascomycetes, whose asci are enclosed in fruit-bodies,\r\n_i.e. ascocarps_. The accessory means of reproduction are free\r\nconidiophores (Fig. 109), conidial-layers (Fig. 122), conidiocarps\r\n(Fig. 120 _D_, _E_, etc.), chlamydospores and oidia.\r\n\r\nFor the different methods of distributing the ascospores, see p. 92.\r\n\r\nOf the six families of the Carpoasci, the first three--_Gymnoascales_,\r\n_Perisporiales_, and _Pyrenomycetes_--are ANGIOCARPIC (that is,\r\nthe ascocarp remains closed throughout its existence, and does not\r\ndehisce when ripe); the fourth and fifth families (_Hysteriales_ and\r\n_Discomycetes_), on the other hand, are HEMIANGIOCARPIC (the ascocarp,\r\nhere also called an _apothecium_, is closed in the early stages,\r\nbut opens at the commencement of ripening and exposes a hymenium of\r\ncrowded asci); the family of _Helvellales_ has probably GYMNOCARPIC (or\r\nhemiangiocarpic) fruit-bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 1. =Gymnoascales.=\r\n\r\nThe ascocarps are surrounded by a _spongy and incomplete envelope_. One\r\norder, poor in species.\r\n\r\n   Order =Gymnoascaceæ=.--The ascocarps are borne sometimes\r\n   solitarily, or sometimes coiled together. _Gymnoascus reessii_\r\n   forms small bodies about 1 mm. in diameter on old horse-dung,\r\n   which at first are white and afterwards orange-red.--_Ctenomyces\r\n   serratus_ lives on the old feathers in birds’ nests.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 2. =Perisporiales.=\r\n\r\nThe ascocarps are surrounded by a _complete envelope_ without any\r\nopening: the fruit-bodies are cleistocarpic; the spores are only\r\nliberated after the disintegration of the fruit-bodies. Paraphyses\r\nare wanting. The two first orders have in addition the means of\r\nreproduction by conidia.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Erysiphaceæ, Mildews.= The Fungi belonging to this order are\r\nepiphytic parasites, whose mycelium, somewhat resembling a cobweb, may\r\nbe seen on the leaves and other green portions of plants (see Figs.\r\n107, 108). The hyphæ ramify in all directions upon the surface of their\r\nhost, and emit haustoria which penetrate the epidermal cells, and\r\nthus derive the necessary nutriment. The Mildew-Fungi thus belong to\r\nthe obligate parasites, and during their growth dwarf and destroy the\r\nportions of their host on which they live. The reproduction takes place\r\nin the first instance by abstriction of conidio-chains from the end of\r\nspecial branches (Fig. 108 _c_, a hypha is seen in the act of detaching\r\na conidium). The conidia may germinate immediately, and thus quickly\r\nreproduce their species. When present in large numbers they appear as\r\na white meal covering the surface of the plant on which the fungus is\r\nfound. Later on appear the dark brown, spheroid ascocarps (Fig. 108\r\n_a_) which, although small, are generally just visible to the naked eye\r\nas black specks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 107.--_Erysiphe cichoracearum_: _a_\r\n  mycelium-threads; _b_ sterile hypha (“pollinodium”); _c_ fertile\r\n  hypha (ascogone or archicarp); _d_ and _e_ young ascocarps.]\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of the Mildew-Fungi is the thin,\r\npseudo-parenchymatous covering of the ascocarp, enclosing _one_\r\n(_Podosphæra_ and _Sphærotheca_; compare _Thelebolus_ among the\r\nHemiasci) or _a few_ asci (Fig. 108 _c_), which do not form\r\nany hymenium, but are irregularly placed. The cells of the\r\nascocarp-envelope are often prolonged into hair-like appendages.\r\nThe ascocarps are developed from the mycelium at places where two\r\nhyphæ cross each other (Fig. 107). At these places two short and\r\nerect hyphæ are produced side by side. The one from the lower hypha\r\n(Fig. 107 _c_) assumes an ellipsoidal shape, and is known as the\r\n_archicarp_ or _ascogone_, while the other (“_pollinodium_”) arches\r\nover the ascogone. From the latter one ascus may be at once developed\r\n(_Sphærotheca_, etc.), or after its division several asci may be\r\nproduced, each developed from one division. The sterile hypha (termed\r\n“pollinodium,” since it was formerly, but erroneously, supposed to\r\nfertilise the ascogone) produces a number of branches, and forms the\r\npseudo-parenchymatous envelope of one cell in thickness, enclosing the\r\nasci.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 108.--_Erysiphe communis._ A small portion\r\n  of a leaf with this Fungus growing upon it (considerably\r\n  magnified). The hyphæ b and d do not belong to this Fungus, but\r\n  are reproductive organs of a pyrenomycetous Fungus parasitic upon\r\n  it (_Cicinnobolus_).]\r\n\r\nMany plants, both cultivated and wild, are attacked by various species\r\nof Mildew. A common means of prevention against their attacks is to\r\ndust the diseased parts with sulphur.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 109.--_Eurotium glaucum_: α portion of\r\n  mycelium lying horizontally; β vertically-placed conidiophore;\r\n  the mycelium gives rise to another branch near α; the conidia are\r\n  abstricted from short flask-shaped cells; _b_ a ripe conidium;\r\n  _c_, _d_ germinating conidia; _e_ spirally-twisted hypha,\r\n  commencement of an ascocarp; _f_ a stage later; _g_ still later,\r\n  the hypha at the base of the coil has given off branches which\r\n  are applied to it; _h_, _i_ sections of young ascocarps.]\r\n\r\n   _Sphærotheca pannosa_ occurs on the leaves of Roses, and on the\r\n   fruit of Peaches and Apricots. _S. castagnei_ on _Humulus_,\r\n   _Cucumis_, etc.--_Erysiphe tuckeri_ grows on the leaves and\r\n   fruit of the Vine; it spins its hyphæ over the bunches of\r\n   grapes, curtails their growth, and causes them to burst, and\r\n   to become decayed and rotten (Grape-disease). The Fungus was\r\n   first noticed in England in 1845, and later was found in\r\n   all countries where grapes are grown. It is only known in\r\n   the conidial form (“Oidium tuckeri”). Many other species of\r\n   _Erysiphe_ are found on herbaceous plants.--_Microsphæra_ has\r\n   appendages which are repeatedly forked at their extremities.\r\n   _M. grossulariæ_ on _Ribes grossularia_.--_Uncinula_ has\r\n   appendages with spirally-coiled extremities; on _Salix_ and\r\n   _Acer_.--_Phyllactinia_ has a circle of bristle-like appendages\r\n   with dilated bases. _P. guttata_ on _Corylus_, _Fraxinus_,\r\n   _Fagus_, etc.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Perisporiaceæ=, Moulds and Mildews. A group of Fungi\r\nwidely distributed and found in all situations. Usually they have a\r\nwell-developed surface mycelium, and small, round, seldom conspicuous\r\nascocarps, containing ovoid, pulley-like spores. They are partly\r\nsaprophytic, partly parasitic, in the latter condition having a brown\r\nmycelium.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 110.--_Eurotium glaucum_: _a_ longitudinal\r\n  section of a half-ripe ascocarp, bounded externally by a\r\n  well-defined layer of cells, enclosing asci in various stages of\r\n  development; _b_ a semi-ripe, _c_ an almost ripe ascus; _d_ and\r\n  _e_ spores seen from the edge and side; _f_ germinating spore\r\n  twenty-two hours after been sown in plum juice.]\r\n\r\n_Eurotium glaucum_ (= _E. herbariorum_, Figs. 109, 110) and _E. repens_\r\nlive on dead organic matter, preserved fruits, etc. The conidial forms\r\nof both species are known as “Moulds” (Fig. 109), and formerly were\r\ndescribed under the name “_Aspergillus glaucus_.” The conidia for some\r\ntime remain attached to each other in chains (Fig. 109 _a_); they are\r\nabstricted from sterigmata arranged radially on the spherical, swollen\r\nend of the conidiophore. The small yellow or brownish ascocarps are\r\nfrequently found in herbaria, especially when the specimens have\r\nbeen insufficiently dried. _Aspergillus fumigatus_ and others are\r\npathogenic, causing mycosis in warm-blooded animals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 111.--_Penicillium crustaceum_: _a_ conidia\r\n  (× 300); _b_ germination of conidia; _c_ small portion of\r\n  mycelium, produced from a conidium at *, with five conidiophores;\r\n  _d_ young conidiophore (× 630), a flask-shaped cell is\r\n  abstricting a conidium; _e_ the same conidiophore after 9–10\r\n  hours.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 112.--_Penicillium crustaceum_: _a_ two\r\n  spirally-coiled hyphæ arise from the mycelium, from one of\r\n  which (archicarp) the asci are produced; _b_ a further step in\r\n  the development of the ascocarp; the branching archicarp is\r\n  surrounded by sterile hyphæ; _c_ section of young ascocarp;\r\n  the larger hyphæ in the centre are the ascogenous hyphæ; these\r\n  are enclosed by a pseudo-parenchyma of sterile hyphæ (× 300);\r\n  _d_ series of ripe asci with spores; _e_ four ascopores seen\r\n  laterally; _f_ germinating ascospores (× 800).]\r\n\r\n_Penicillium crustaceum_ (_P. glaucum_, Figs. 111, 112) is an\r\nexceedingly common “Mould.” Its mycelium appears very frequently on\r\nany organic matter which is permitted to remain untouched, and soon\r\ncovers it with a dense mass of blue-green conidiophores. These branch\r\nat their summits and bear flask-shaped cells from which the conidia\r\nare abstricted. The ascocarps which, both in size and colour, resemble\r\ngrains of sand, have only been obtained in luxuriant cultivation with a\r\nlimited supply of oxygen.\r\n\r\n   _Capnodium salicinum_ (_Fumago salicina_, _Cladosporium\r\n   fumago_), a common Mildew, forms dark overgrowths on the leaves\r\n   and branches of various shrubs (Poplars, Elms, Willows) and on\r\n   Hops. The conidia appear in various forms, as on conidiophores,\r\n   in conidiocarps with large multicellular conidia, and in\r\n   conidiocarps with small unicellular conidia; in nutritive\r\n   solutions yeast-like conidia are also developed.--_Apiosporium\r\n   pinophilum_ produces mildew on the leaves of _Abies alba_ and\r\n   _Picea excelsa_. (The conidial-forms were formerly described as\r\n   “_Antennaria pinophila_”).\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Tuberaceæ, Truffles.= The Fungi belonging to this order\r\nare entirely subterranean. The mycelium is filamentous, and partly\r\nparasitic upon the roots of plants, especially trees, in its\r\nneighbourhood; it is then known as _Mycorhiza_. The fruit-body is\r\nrelatively large, in some cases about the size of a hen’s egg.\r\nInternally it is traversed by a number of winding passages (Fig. 113\r\n_a_), the walls of which are coated with the asci. The asci (_b_)\r\ncontain only a small number of spores, and these are set free by the\r\nputrefaction of the fruit-body. Conidia are unknown.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 113.--_Tuber melanosporum_: _a_ fruit-body\r\n  (nat. size), a portion having been removed to show the internal\r\n  structure; _b_ an ascus with ascospores.]\r\n\r\n   _Tuber melanosporum_, _T. brumale_, _T. æstivum_, and other\r\n   species are edible. _Terfezia leonis_ and _Choiromyces\r\n   mæandriformis_ are also edible. The Truffles are always found in\r\n   woods and under trees, and disappear when these are destroyed.\r\n   France and Italy produce the best and the largest number of\r\n   Truffles, which are hunted by specially trained dogs and pigs.\r\n\r\n   In _Elaphomyces_ (Stag-Truffle) the fruit-body has a corky\r\n   external layer, and is inedible. Some of the species are found\r\n   in this country. _E. granulatus_ is parasitic on the roots of\r\n   the Fir.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 3. =Pyrenomycetes.=\r\n\r\nIn this family the hymenium is enclosed in small fruit-bodies,\r\n_perithecia_ (Fig. 120 _b_), which appear to the naked eye as small\r\ndots. In shape they resemble a globe or a flask with a narrow mouth,\r\nthrough which the spores are ejected (peronocarpic ascocarps).\r\nDifferent kinds of reproduction--conidia, pycnidia (chiefly with\r\nmicroconidia), chlamydospores, and perithecia--are found in the same\r\nspecies. The various stages in the life-history of these Fungi are so\r\ndissimilar, that formally they were considered to be different genera.\r\nErgot furnishes a very good example.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 114.--A small portion of an ovary attacked\r\n  with _Claviceps purpurea_ (_Sphacelia_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 115.--An ovary with the conidial stage of\r\n  _Claviceps purpurea_ (_Sphacelia_).]\r\n\r\nThis family may be subdivided into 3 sub-families.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Sub-Family 1. =Hypocreales.=\r\n\r\nThe perithecia are _pale, fleshy, brightly coloured_, and generally\r\naggregated on a stroma. Conidia and chlamydospores occur very\r\nfrequently. Only one order.\r\n\r\nOrder. =Hypocreaceæ.= In this order the majority are parasites upon\r\nFlowering-plants (_Nectria_, _Polystigma_, _Epichloë_, _Claviceps_);\r\nbut some are parasites upon Fungi (_Hypomyces_, _Melanospora_), or upon\r\ninsects (_Cordyceps_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 116.--_Claviceps purpurea. A_ Sclerotium\r\n  with stromata (_cl_) (× by 2). _B_ Stroma divided longitudinally\r\n  to show the perithecia (_cp_). _C_ A perithecium with the\r\n  surrounding hyphæ (_hy_). _D_ An ascus ruptured, with the eight\r\n  filamentous ascospores emerging.]\r\n\r\nThe most important member of this order is the ERGOT (_Claviceps\r\npurpurea_, Figs. 114, 115, 116). This Fungus is found in the flowers of\r\nmany species of Grasses, especially the Rye, attacking and destroying\r\nthe ovaries. In the FIRST or CONIDIAL STAGE of the attack, the ovaries\r\nare found covered with a white, irregularly folded mycelium (Fig. 114\r\n_m_, Fig. 115), formed of numerous hyphæ woven together and penetrating\r\nthe wall of the ovary. From these a number of hyphæ (Fig. 114 _a_)\r\nproject into the air and abstrict from their apices the conidia (_b_)\r\nwhich serve as reproductive organs. The mycelium also secretes a\r\nsticky, stinking fluid (honey-dew) in which the conidia are embedded\r\nin great numbers. The honey-dew exudes from the bases of the glumes,\r\nand is greedily sought by flies, which thus carry the conidia to\r\nother ovaries. In this manner fresh ears are infected, which might\r\nescape were the conidia only distributed by the wind. This stage\r\nformerly was regarded as an independent Fungus, known as _Sphacelia\r\nsegetum_ (Fig. 115). On germination, the conidia produce either a new\r\nmycelium (Fig. 114 _d_, _c_), or new conidia. The SECOND or SCLEROTIUM\r\nSTAGE is the one in which the Fungus passes the winter. The mycelium\r\npenetrates deeper and deeper into the attacked ovaries, their tissues\r\nare destroyed and replaced by the hyphæ, which gradually become more\r\nand more felted together. A firm, pseudo-parenchymatous mass of hyphæ\r\nis thus formed at the base of the loosely-woven _Sphacelia_, which is\r\nin part transformed into the hard sclerotium, and the remainder thrown\r\noff. A dark, hard, poisonous body, longer than the natural grain,\r\nis thus formed; these bodies are known as Ergots, and were formerly\r\nconsidered to be a distinct species,--_Sclerotium clavus_ (“Secale\r\ncornutum,” Ergot, Fig. 116 _A_, _c_). The THIRD STAGE, described as\r\n_Claviceps purpurea_, is developed in the following spring from the\r\ngerminating sclerotium, which produces dark-red stromata with short\r\nstalks. In the stroma numerous perithecia with asci and ascospores are\r\nproduced. The latter may infect young flowers of the cereals, in which\r\nthe disease is then developed as before.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 117.--_Nectria cinnabarina_: _a_ branch of\r\n  _Acer pseudoplatanus_, with conidial-layers and perithecia (nat.\r\n  size); _b_ a conidial-layer (_Tuberculoria vulgaris_); _c_, a\r\n  mass of perithecia. (_b_ and _c_ × 8.)]\r\n\r\n   Several species of the genus _Nectria_, with blood-red\r\n   perithecia, are found as dangerous parasites, especially _N.\r\n   ditissima_, which causes “Canker” in the Beech, Ash, and Apple,\r\n   etc.; _N. cucurbitula_, which appears on Pine-trees, and _N.\r\n   cinnabarina_ (Fig. 117), whose conidial form was formerly named\r\n   _Tubercularia vulgaris_.--_Polystigma rubrum_ forms shining\r\n   red spots on the green leaves of _Prunus_-species.--_Epichloë\r\n   typhina_ is parasitic on the sheaths of Grasses, on which it\r\n   first forms a white conidial-layer, later on a yellow layer of\r\n   perithecia.--_Cordyceps_ (Chrysalis Fungus, Figs. 118, 119)\r\n   lives in and destroys insects, and after compassing their death\r\n   produces the club-formed, generally yellow, stromata, one part\r\n   of which bears conidia (_Isaria_) and another perithecia. _C.\r\n   militaris_ (Fig. 118) on the chrysalides and caterpillars of\r\n   moths, is the most common.\r\n\r\n   The so-called _Botrytis bassiana_, which produces the disease\r\n   known by the name of “Muscardine,” in silkworms, is probably a\r\n   conidial form belonging to _Cordyceps_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 118.--_Cordyceps militaris._ I Stromata with\r\n  conidiophores (_Isaria farinosa_).

The\r\nperithecia are of a _firm consistence_ (tough, leathery, woody or\r\ncarbonaceous), and of a _dark_ colour. Their _covering_ is _quite\r\ndistinct from the stroma_ when this structure is present. The\r\nstromata are sometimes very large, and may be either cushion-like,\r\ncrustaceous, upright and club-like, or branched bodies. In general,\r\nsmall, inconspicuous Fungi, living on dead vegetable matter, sometimes\r\nparasites. Free conidiophores and conidiocarps are known in many\r\nspecies, and in several, chlamydospore-like forms of reproduction.\r\nOrders 3–18 constitute the Sphæriaceæ of older systematists.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 120.--_Strickeria obducens_: _a_ a portion\r\n  of an Ash-branch with the bark partly thrown off; on the wood\r\n  are numerous black perithecia (× 20); _b_ longitudinal section\r\n  through a perithecium; _c_ a spore; _d_ longitudinal section\r\n  through a pycnidium whose ascospores are being ejected; _e_\r\n  portion of the same, with hyphæ and spores.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Sordariaceæ.=--Fungi living on dung with fragile perithecia,\r\neither aerial or buried in the substratum.

In the first three sub-families, and generally also in the\r\nfourth, the apothecia are formed inside the substratum. The apothecia\r\nare, in contrast to the Pyrenomycetes, light and brightly coloured,\r\nand their size varies very much, and may be several centimetres in\r\ndiameter. Paraphyses are often present between the asci; they often\r\ncontain colouring matter, and give to the disc its characteristic\r\ncolour. The tissue on which the asci are borne is known as the\r\n_hypothecium_. The shape and colour of the spores is not so varied as\r\nin the Pyrenomycetes.

Investigations during the last\r\ntwenty-five years, however, have conclusively proved that the Lichens\r\nare Fungi which reproduce in the same manner as the Ascomycetes, or,\r\nmore rarely, the Basidiomycetes, and have entered into a peculiar\r\n_symbiotic relation with Algæ_, especially the Cyanophyceæ and\r\nProtococcoideæ, with which they associate, and without which they\r\nwould be unable to exist. The Fungus forms the largest portion of the\r\nLichen, enclosing the Alga with which it may be said to be commensal.\r\nThe Fungus especially produces reproductive bodies and absorbs the\r\ninorganic nourishment through the rhizoids, whilst the Alga supplies\r\nit with the organic materials. In consequence of this the Lichens, in\r\ncontradistinction to other Fungi, need light for the development of\r\ntheir nutritive organs, and are therefore, in any case internally, of\r\na more or less greenish colour. The form and condition of the thallus\r\nis unusual among the Fungi, and they can grow upon rocks and in other\r\nplaces where no dead organic matter, such as would be required by other\r\nFungi, is obtainable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 131.--Transverse section through the thallus\r\n  of _Sticta fuliginosa_ (× 500): _r-r_ rhizoid-strands, which\r\n  arise from the under side; _g-g_ gonidial layer; _m_ medullary\r\n  layer; _o_ upper, _u_ lower cortex.]\r\n\r\nTwo cellular forms are therefore to be found in each Lichen:\r\n\r\n1. The cells which belong to the Fungus. These are generally septate,\r\nbranched _hyphæ_ without any trace of chlorophyll. In the thallus of\r\nthe majority of Lichens there may be found a medullary layer (Fig.\r\n131 _m_) of loosely-woven hyphæ, between which there are large air\r\nchambers; and an _external layer_ (cortex) (Fig. 131 _o_, _u_) formed\r\nof closely-woven hyphæ without any intercellular spaces. In some\r\nLichens (Collemaceæ) the hyphæ wind about in the thallus, being equally\r\ndistributed throughout, without forming any decided strata. These\r\nLichens moreover become gelatinous when exposed to moisture (Fig. 132),\r\non account of the swelling of the walls of the Algæ. The hyphæ contain\r\nprotoplasm with drops of oil, but never starch; their walls easily\r\nswell when exposed to damp after having been dried, and in some (_e.g._\r\n_Cetraria islandica_) they become gelatinous when cooked. Certain\r\nstrata of hyphæ become blue on treatment with iodine alone, from which\r\nit is inferred that the wall is allied, in its chemical nature, to\r\nstarch.\r\n\r\n2. The enclosed Algæ, termed “gonidia.” Some belonging to the\r\nCyanophyceæ, Protococcoideæ, (especially _Pleurococcus_) and\r\nChroococcaceæ, are spherical and are found isolated, or in irregular\r\n_groups_ of cells (Fig. 131 _g_); some belonging to _Nostoc_ (Fig. 132\r\n_g_), Lyngbyaceæ, etc., are placed in cell-rows. Each Lichen, as a\r\nrule, has only one definite Algal-form for its gonidium.\r\n\r\nThe gonidia either lie together in a certain stratum between the\r\ncortex and the medullary layer (Fig. 131 _g_), or are scattered\r\nirregularly throughout the entire thallus (Fig. 132). The thallus is\r\nin the first instance termed “heteromerous,” in the second instance,\r\n“homoiomerous.” The Fungal-hyphæ embrace the gonidia and apply\r\nthemselves closely to, or even penetrate them, and hence it has been\r\ndifficult to decide whether the one cellular form does or does not\r\ndevelop from the other (Figs. 134, 135).\r\n\r\n   This theory regarding the symbiosis of Fungi and Algæ to form\r\n   a Lichen is termed the Schwendenerian theory, after the first\r\n   scientist who advanced it with any weight. It had been already\r\n   indicated by De Bary, and further arguments in its support have\r\n   at a later time been adduced by Bornet, Stahl, Treub, Frank,\r\n   Bonnier, Alfr. Möller and others.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 132.--_Collema microphyllum._ Transverse\r\n  section through the thallus; _g Nostoc_-chains; _h_ hyphæ.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 133.--_Ephebe pubescens._ The apex of a\r\n  branch of the thallus with two lateral branches (_s_): _h_ its\r\n  hyphæ; _g_ the apical gonidium of the main branch.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 134.--_Nostoc lichenoides_, which is attached\r\n  by a germinating thread (_h_) of _Collema glaucescens_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 135.--_A_ Germinating spore of _Physcia\r\n  parietina_ with _Protococcus viridis_. _B Synalissa symphorea_\r\n  with _Glæocapsa_. _C Cladonia furcata_ with _Protococcus_.]\r\n\r\nThe thallus of the Lichen appears mainly under three forms:--\r\n\r\n1. The CRUSTACEOUS, which adheres firmly to the substratum (bark,\r\nstone) throughout its entire surface, without being raised into any\r\nfree patches or lobes. It has, in many instances, no definite outline,\r\nand hyphal-branches from it often penetrate deeply into the substratum.\r\nIt grows at the circumference and sometimes dies away in the centre\r\n(Figs. 138, 139, 140).\r\n\r\n2. The FOLIACEOUS. This also lies flat upon the substratum, but is not\r\nfirmly attached to and has a definite outline. It grows at the margin,\r\nand raises itself a little by free outgrowths and lobes (Fig. 141). The\r\nrhizoid-strands spring out from its whitish under surface (Fig. 131,\r\n_r_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 136.--Portion of a hymenium: _d_ a thin\r\n  stratum on which the asci (_s_) are situated.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 137.--Spores of, _a Cladonia_, _Lecanora_\r\n  and _Pertusaria_; _b Bæomyces_; _c Sphinctrina_; _d_, _e_,\r\n  _f_ various species of _Parmelia_; _g_, _h Verrucaria_ in its\r\n  younger and older condition; _i_, _k_ species of _Leptogium_.]\r\n\r\n3. The FRUTICOSE, which is attached to its substratum at a small point\r\nfrom which it projects freely, either erect or pendulous. It is more\r\nor less tufted, in the form of a bush (Figs. 142, 143). These three\r\nthallus-forms gradually pass over by many intermediate forms into one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 138.--_Lecanora subfusca_: _a_ the bark on\r\n  which it is situated; _l_ the thallus; _s_ the ascocarp; _s’_ an\r\n  ascocarp.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 139.--_Graphis_ (two species).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 140.--_Pertusaria communis._]\r\n\r\nThe Lichens, like other Ascomycetes, have very variously constructed\r\nascospores (Fig. 137), which are enclosed in asci (Fig. 136), usually\r\nsurrounded by paraphyses attached together. Furthermore they possess\r\npycnidia (Fig. 141) containing numerous microconidia. These were\r\nformerly considered as organs of fructification, and were termed\r\n“spermatia,” and the pycnidia, “spermogonia.” Alfr. Möller proved,\r\nin 1887, that the microconidia are able to germinate and produce a\r\nmycelium with new conidia, just as in other Ascomycetes.\r\n\r\nVEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION takes place by _soredia_, which to the naked\r\neye appear as whitish powder on the surface of the thallus. They are\r\nsmall round bodies, formed by one or a group of gonidia, which are\r\nsurrounded by a mass of felted hyphæ. After the rupture of the cortex\r\nthey are set free, and readily carried by the wind to other places,\r\nwhere under favourable circumstances they establish a new thallus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 141.--_A_ A portion of the thallus of\r\n  _Parmelia parietina_ with ascocarps (_a_) and pycnidia (_b_). _B_\r\n  A portion of the thallus of _Cetraria islandica_ with pycnidia\r\n  at the end of small lobes. _C_ A lobe with pycnidia and ejected\r\n  microconidia. (Magnified).]\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. The Lichens are the most hardy plants, and\r\nare the first to appear on hitherto bare rocks which they gradually\r\ndisintegrate, and hence prepare the way for the growth of other plants.\r\nThey are to be found from the Polar regions to the Equator; from the\r\nhighest snow-free mountain-peaks down to the level of the sea; on the\r\nstems of trees; on rocks, soil, some even on inundated places; on\r\nstones in woodland streams, and on beaches; but they are never found\r\nupon rotten organic remains. Some grow gregariously in enormous masses,\r\nand form wide-stretching carpets, _e.g._ Reindeer Moss (_Cladonia\r\nrangiferina_), species of _Cetraria_ and other fruticose Lichens.\r\n\r\nUSES. On account of the cell-wall being composed of Lichenstarch\r\n(Lichenin), the Iceland-Lichen and Manna-Lichen (_Lecanora esculenta_)\r\nare used as food; the latter grows on stones, in the deserts of Asia\r\nand North Africa, and is often torn loose in large masses and carried\r\naway by the wind. The Reindeer-Lichen is not only the principal food of\r\nthe reindeer, but it is also used in the manufacture of Danish brandy.\r\n_Cetraria islandica_ (Lichen islandicus) is OFFICINAL. Colouring\r\nmaterials (lacmus, orseille, persio) are made from several species,\r\nespecially from _Roccella tinctoria_ (from the rocky coasts of the\r\nMediterranean). _Parmelia saxatilis_ and particularly _Lecanora\r\ntartarea_ are used for colouring purposes in the Northern countries.\r\n\r\nAbout 2,000 species of Lichens have been described. If we disregard the\r\nBasidiolichenes, which will be considered on page 176, the remaining\r\nLichens (Ascolichenes) may be divided into the two following orders\r\naccording to the structure of the fruit-bodies:--\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Pyrenolichenes.= The ascocarps (apothecia) are spherical or\r\nflask-shaped, as in the Pyrenomycetes, more rarely linear (_Graphis_).\r\n\r\n   According to the nature of the thallus, these Lichens may be\r\n   divided into:--\r\n\r\n   _a._ Thallus homoiomerous, but not gelatinous, branching\r\n   according to the mode of growth of the Algæ: _Ephebe_ (Fig.\r\n   133), with Algæ of the genus _Stigonema_.\r\n\r\n   _b._ Thallus homoiomerous, gelatinous: _Lichina_.\r\n\r\n   _c._ Thallus heteromerous, crustaceous: _Verrucaria_,\r\n   _Pyrenula_; _Graphis_ (Fig. 139), which may be considered as\r\n   Hysteriaceæ with gonidia; several species of _Graphis_ are\r\n   common on bark.\r\n\r\n   _d._ Thallus heteromerous, foliaceous: _Endocarpon_.\r\n\r\n   _e._ Thallus heteromerous, fruticose: _Sphærophorus_.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Discolichenes.= These, as in the Discomycetes, have open\r\napothecia, which, as a rule, are cupular, more rarely hemispherical\r\n(_Cladonia_).\r\n\r\n   According to the nature of the thallus, these Lichens may be\r\n   divided into:--\r\n\r\n   _a._ Thallus homoiomerous, but not gelatinous, branching\r\n   according to the mode of growth of the Algæ: _Cœnogonium_.\r\n\r\n   _b._ Thallus homoiomerous, gelatinous: _Collema_ (Fig. 132),\r\n   with Algæ of the genus _Nostoc_; _Leptogium_.\r\n\r\n   _c._ Thallus heteromerous, crustaceous: _Pertusaria_ (Fig.\r\n   140), _Lecidea_, with apothecia open from the beginning;\r\n   _Lecanora_, with apothecia, which in the beginning are closed,\r\n   later on open, but with a rim formed by the thallus (Fig. 138);\r\n   _Bæomyces_, whose apothecia are borne on a stem formed by the\r\n   thallus.\r\n\r\n   _d._ Thallus heteromerous, foliaceous: _Parmelia_ (_P.\r\n   saxatilis_; _P. parietina_, Wall-Lichen, Fig. 141, is yellow,\r\n   very frequent on tree-stems, stone-walls, tiles); _Physcia_ (_P.\r\n   ciliaris_, frequent on tree-stems); _Sticta_ (_S. pulmonacea_,\r\n   Lung-Lichen, on tree-stems); _Peltigera_, especially on the Moss\r\n   among trees; _Umbilicaria_, on rocks.\r\n\r\n   _e._ Thallus heteromerous, fruticose: _Cetraria_ (_C.\r\n   islandica_), “Iceland Moss,” with an olive-brown, flat,\r\n   furrowed, fringed thallus, on heaths; _C. nivalis_, white, in\r\n   the Polar regions; _Evernia_, _Ramalina_, _Usnea_ (_U. barbata_,\r\n   Beard-Lichen, Fig. 143); _Roccella_, _Stereocaulon_, _Cladonia_,\r\n   of which the genus _C. rangiferina_, Reindeer-Moss (Fig. 142) is\r\n   important; _Cladonia_ has two kinds of thallus, one scaly and\r\n   leaf-like, the other erect, which bears the apothecia and may be\r\n   fruticose (Fig. 142), or cupular (Fig. 144); they grow in soil\r\n   in forests and on heaths.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 142.--_Cladonia rangiferina_: _s_ ascocarp.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 143.--_Usnea barbata_: _s_ ascocarp.\r\n  (Slightly magnified.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 144.--_Cladonia pyxidata._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Sub-Class 2. =Basidiomycetes.=\r\n\r\nThis sub-class embraces the most highly developed Fungi, with large\r\n“fruit-bodies,” which in ordinary language we shortly term Funguses,\r\nToadstools, or Mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThey have no sporangia, but reproduce only by means of basidiospores,\r\nconidia, chlamydospores and oidia. The chief characteristic of this\r\nsub-class is the _basidium_ (Fig. 145), _i.e._ the conidiophore, which\r\nhas a distinctive form, and bears a definite number (generally 4) of\r\ncharacteristically shaped conidia (basidiospores, Fig. 145 _c_, _d_,\r\n_e_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 145.--Development of spores in _Corticium_.]\r\n\r\nThe summit of each basidium is produced generally into four conical\r\npoints (_sterigmata_, Fig. 145 _b_), from each of which a basidiospore\r\nis abstricted. The basidia may be classified into three principal\r\ngroups, each of which accompanies a distinctive conidiophore: 1,\r\nthe long, filamentous, _transversely divided_ basidia, with lateral\r\nsterigmata and spores, found in the Uredinaceæ (Figs. 146 _D_, 153),\r\nAuriculariaceæ (Fig. 160 _B_), and Pilacraceæ; 2, the spherical,\r\n_longitudinally divided_ basidia of the Tremellaceæ (Figs. 160 _C d_;\r\n161 iii. iv.); and 3, the ovoid, or cylindrical, _undivided_ basidia of\r\nthe Autobasidiomycetes (Figs. 145, 163, etc.); the two last have apical\r\nsterigmata and spores.\r\n\r\n   The first two groups are the septate basidia (_protobasidia_),\r\n   of the _Protobasidiomycetes_; while the unseptate basidia\r\n   (autobasidia) of the _Autobasidiomycetes_ are the third group.\r\n   On the formation of the basidiospores, the nucleus of the\r\n   basidium divides into four nuclei, each of which is transferred\r\n   to a spore.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the basidia, _simple conidiophores_ are also found.\r\nIn the Protobasidiomycetes, the simple conidia are very generally\r\nfound as accessory methods of reproduction in conjunction with the\r\nbasidiospores; but less frequently in the Autobasidiomycetes, _e.g._\r\namong the Dacryomycetes, Tomentellaceæ, _Heterobasidion annosum_.\r\n\r\n   The simple conidiophores vary in size, and in the number and\r\n   shape of the conidia; they, however, resemble the basidia,\r\n   and are doubtless an early stage in the development of the\r\n   definitely formed basidia.\r\n\r\nFinally, well-defined _chlamydospores_, formed in various ways, appear\r\nin the Basidiomycetes as supplementary reproductive bodies (compare p.\r\n90). Among the Protobasidiomycetes, chlamydospores are at present only\r\nfound among the Uredinaceæ, but in various forms; in the majority of\r\nfamilies of the Autobasidiomycetes _oidia_ frequently occur (Fig. 162),\r\nbut genuine chlamydospores seldom.\r\n\r\nIn the same species several of the known forms of reproduction may be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe _mycelium_ is generally composed of white, branched strands,\r\nconsisting of numerous felted hyphæ; in some, sclerotia are found.--The\r\ngreat majority are saprophytes; some (particularly all the Uredinaceæ),\r\nare parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DIVISIONS OF THE BASIDIOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n    Series 1.

BASIDIOLICHENES: Lichen-forming basidiomycetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Series I. =Protobasidiomycetes.=\r\n\r\nTo this series belong the lowest of the Basidiomycetes. The _basidia_\r\nappear in two principal forms (1 and 2 on page 144) and are _divided_\r\ninto four cells, either transversely or longitudinally, each division\r\nforming a sterigma which abstricts a basidiospore. The first three\r\norders, Uredinaceæ, Auriculariaceæ, and Tremellaceæ have _gymnocarpic_\r\nfruit-bodies, while those of the Pilacraceæ, on the contrary, are\r\n_angiocarpic_.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Uredinaceæ (Rusts).= All the Rust-Fungi are parasites, their\r\nmycelium living in the interior of the stems and leaves of their\r\nhosts, causing red, brown, or black spots--hence their name--and\r\nmalformations, sometimes of considerable size.\r\n\r\nThe Rust-Fungi are gymnocarpic and destitute of a hymenium; for these\r\nreasons they are regarded as the simplest order of the Basidiomycetes.\r\nThey are entirely parasitic, and their filamentous, branched mycelium\r\nramifies in the intercellular spaces of its host, and often protrudes\r\nhaustoria into the cells. The mycelium is perennial should it enter a\r\nwoody tissue; it may also hibernate in the rhizomes of perennial herbs\r\nand permeate the shoots springing from them, but in the majority of\r\nthe Rust-Fungi the mycelium has a very limited growth. The chief means\r\nof reproduction of the Rust-Fungi are the _chlamydospores_, which in\r\nthe more highly developed species occur in three forms, namely, the\r\nteleuto-, æcidio-, and uredo-spores. The spores, in the host, are\r\nformed immediately beneath its epidermis, which is ruptured on the\r\nripening of the spores, with the production of “rust,” brown, red, or\r\nblack spots. Those chlamydospores which produce basidia are termed\r\n_teleutospores_. The spore on germination produces a _transversely\r\ndivided basidium_, “promycelium,” on which basidiospores, “sporidia,”\r\ngenerally four in number, are produced on lateral sterigmata. This\r\nbasidio-fructification is _gymnocarpic_; the basidia neither form a\r\nhymenium nor a fruit-body (only _Cronartium_ and _Gymnosporangium_ have\r\na slight indication of a basidio-fructification).\r\n\r\nMany Rust-Fungi, in addition to basidiospores, have small, _unicellular\r\nconidia_, “spermatia,” which are borne in conidiocarps, “_spermogonia_.”\r\n\r\nThe ~TELEUTOSPORES~ (_Winter-spores_) may be either unicellular or\r\nmulticellular; in the majority of cases they are enclosed in a hard\r\nouter cell-wall, the exospore, which in some cases is very strongly\r\ndeveloped; they have also a long or short stalk, the remains of the\r\nspore-bearing hypha. Each cell of the teleutospore has _one germ-pore_\r\n(a thin portion of the wall, for the protrusion of the germ-tube;\r\nin _Phragmidium_ and _Gymnosporangium_ there are, however, several\r\ngerm-pores). The colour of the teleutospores is generally much darker\r\nthan that of the uredospores, and it is by these that the majority of\r\nthe Rust-Fungi _hibernate_.\r\n\r\n   In _Gymnosporangium_, two kinds of teleutospores are found\r\n   (distinguished by their size and thickness of exospore). In many\r\n   species of _Puccinia_, the form of the teleutospores varies\r\n   very much, so that in the same layer spores have been observed\r\n   with the characteristic form of other, allied genera.--The\r\n   teleutospores of _Endophyllum_ resemble æcidiospores, since they\r\n   are united in chains, whose cells are easily separated, and are\r\n   produced in the interior of a “peridium.” The multicellular\r\n   teleutospores of _Coleosporium_ function as basidia, and from\r\n   each cell immediately produce basidiospores.--The teleutospores\r\n   of _Coleosporium_ and _Chrysomyxa_, differ from other\r\n   teleutospores in the absence of exospore and germ-pore.\r\n\r\nThe ÆCIDOSPORES (_Spring-spores_) are produced in chains which are\r\ngenerally enclosed in an _envelope_ of hyphæ, the _peridium_; the\r\n_peridium_ enclosing the spores being termed the _æcidium_. The\r\næcidiospores are unicellular, and generally of an orange colour; they\r\nare often separated by intermediate cells which wither and so assist\r\nin the distribution of the spores. The exospore is made up of minute,\r\nradially arranged rods. _Generally germination_ proceeds _immediately_,\r\nthe æcidiospore producing a germ-tube, which developes into a mycelium\r\nbearing either uredo- or teleutospores.\r\n\r\n   The æcidia of many Rust-Fungi were formerly considered as\r\n   distinct genera. The æcidia of _Phragmidium_, _Triphragmium_,\r\n   and _Melampsora_, in which the _peridium is wanting_, were in\r\n   part considered as _Cæoma_. The æcidia with fimbriate edge,\r\n   or those of _Gymnosporangium_ with longitudinal lattice-like\r\n   splits, were considered as “_Rœstelia_” (Lattice-Rust); large,\r\n   sac-shaped æcidia on the Coniferæ were known as _Peridermium_.\r\n\r\nThe ~UREDOSPORES~ (_Summer-spores_) are unicellular and arise singly,\r\nseldom in chains (_Coleosporium_). Their colourless, warty exospore\r\nbears, _in the equatorial plane_, 2–8 _germ-pores_. In the majority,\r\n_germination_ proceeds _immediately_, and a mycelium is produced which\r\nat first gives rise to uredospores and afterwards to teleutospores.\r\n\r\n   The uredospore-formations of _Melampsorella_ and _Cronartium_\r\n   are enclosed in an _envelope_, and hence resemble\r\n   æcidia.--Between the uredospores sterile, unicellular hyphæ\r\n   (paraphyses) may be found.\r\n\r\nThe _spermogonia_ are spherical or pear-shaped _conidiocarps_,\r\ngenerally embedded in the substratum, and are produced before the\r\næcidia, before or simultaneously with the uredospores, or before the\r\nteleutospores. The conidia, as far as observations go, do not generally\r\ngerminate under ordinary conditions.\r\n\r\nAmong the Rust-Fungi some species are found which only form\r\nbasidiospores and teleutospores (_Puccinia malvacearum_, _Chrysomyxa\r\nabietis_). Other species have in addition uredospores; others\r\nspermogonia and uredospores; others spermogonia and æcidia; others\r\nspermogonia, uredospores and æcidia. Those species in which all the\r\nmethods of reproduction are not developed must not be considered as\r\nincomplete forms.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the mycelium, which is produced from the basidiospores,\r\ndevelopes æcidia; in the species, however, without æcidia, it\r\ndevelopes the uredo-form, and when the uredospores are also absent,\r\nthe teleutospore-form. It has been established in some species\r\nof _Puccinia_ and _Uromyces_ that the formation of æcidia can be\r\nsuppressed, and it is not a necessary part of the cycle of development\r\nof the species.\r\n\r\n   The majority of Rust-Fungi hibernate in the teleutospore-form.\r\n   Many species are able to hibernate in the uredospore-form\r\n   (_Coleosporium senecionis_). Others pass the winter in the\r\n   æcidio-form, and develope æcidia on new hosts (_Uromyces pisi_,\r\n   on _Euphorbia cyparissias_; _Phragmidium subcorticium_, on\r\n   _Rosa_; _Æcidium elatinum_, on _Abies alba_). In _Chrysomyxa\r\n   abietis_, the mycelium, developed from the basidiospores,\r\n   survives the winter.\r\n\r\nAmong the Rust-Fungi, with several forms of reproduction, there are\r\nabout sixty whose development can only be completed by an _alternation\r\nof hosts_, that is, on one host only uredo-and teleutospores\r\nare produced, while the further development of the germinating\r\nbasidiospores, and the formation of the æcidia and spermogonia from its\r\nmycelium, can only take place on a second quite distinct and definite\r\nhost (_heterœcious_ or _metoxenous_ Fungi). Those Fungi which have all\r\ntheir forms of reproduction on the same host are termed _autœcious_ or\r\n_autoxenous_. It is not, however, always necessary that the heterœcious\r\nRust-Fungi should regularly change their hosts; for example, _Puccinia\r\ngraminis_ can hibernate in the uredo-form on the wild Grasses, and in\r\nthe spring can distribute itself again in the same form.\r\n\r\n   As a consequence of the alternation of hosts the various forms\r\n   of development were considered as independent genera (_Uredo_,\r\n   _Æcidium_, _Rœstelia_, _Cæoma_, _Peridermium_), until De Bary\r\n   and Oersted established, about the same time (1865), the mutual\r\n   connection of some forms, and paved the way for the right\r\n   conception of these Fungi.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 146.--_Puccinia graminis_.]\r\n\r\nAs an example of one of the most highly developed species, _Puccinia\r\ngraminis_, the “Rust of Wheat,” holds a prominent position. Its\r\nuredospores and teleutospores are produced (Fig. 146) on Grasses\r\n(on cereals, especially Wheat, Rye, Oats, and many wild Grasses),\r\nwhile the æcidia and spermogonia are confined to the Berberidaceæ.\r\nThe teleutospores, developed on the Grasses, hibernate on the dried\r\nportions of their host, and in the succeeding year each of the\r\ntwo cells of the teleutospore may develop a _basidium_ with four\r\nbasidiospores (Fig. 146 _D_, _c_). The basidiospores are distributed by\r\nthe wind, germinate quickly, and only proceed to further development on\r\n_Berberis_ or _Mahonia_. The germ-tube _bores through the epidermis_ of\r\nthe Barberry-leaf, and forms a mycelium in its interior, its presence\r\nbeing indicated by reddish-yellow spots on the leaf. After 6–10 days\r\nthe flask-shaped _spermogonia_ appear (Fig. 147 _B_; _C_, _a_; conidia\r\nin Fig. 147 _D_) and a few days later the cup-shaped _æcidia_ (Fig.\r\n147 _A_; _C_, _c_, _d_, _e_). The former are generally on the _upper_,\r\nand the latter on the _under side_ of the leaf. The orange-coloured\r\næcidiospores scatter like dust, and germinate only on Grasses; the\r\ngermination takes place in about two days when placed on any green\r\npart of a Grass. The germ-tube enters the Grass-leaf through a stoma;\r\na mycelium is developed in the leaf, giving rise to a small, oval,\r\nrust-coloured spot (Fig. 146 _A_); in about 6–9 days the epidermis is\r\nruptured over the red spot, and numerous reddish-yellow _uredospores_,\r\nformed on the mycelium, are set free. The uredospores (Fig. 146 _B_)\r\nare scattered by the wind, and can germinate should they fall on the\r\ngreen portions of other Grasses: they then emit 2–4 germ-tubes through\r\nthe equatorially-placed germ-pores. The germ-tubes enter a leaf through\r\na stoma, a new mycelium is then developed, and in about eight days\r\na fresh production of uredospores takes place, which germinate as\r\nbefore. The uredospore-mycelium very soon produces, in addition, the\r\nbrown _teleutospores_, which give a brown colour to the rust-coloured\r\nspots, the familiar uredospores on the cereals being quite suppressed\r\ntowards the close of the summer (Fig. 146 _C, D_). The “Rust of Wheat”\r\nhibernates on some wild Grasses in the uredospore-form.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 147.--_Æcidium berberidis_. _A_ Portion of\r\n  lower surface of leaf of Barberry, with cluster-cups (æcidia).\r\n  _B_ A small portion of leaf, with spermogonia, from above. _C_\r\n  Transverse section of leaf on the upper side, in the palisade\r\n  parenchyma are three spermogonia (_a b_); on the lower side an\r\n  unripe æcidium (_c d_) and two ripe æcidia (_d, e, f_); _f_ chain\r\n  of æcidiospores. _D_ Hyphæ, forming conidia.]\r\n\r\n   GENERA. _Puccinia_ (Fig. 146, 147) has bicellular teleutospores,\r\n   each having a germ-pore, and the æcidia when present have an\r\n   indented peridium; some species, as exceptions, have 1–3-celled\r\n   teleutospores. Many species are HETERŒCIOUS, for example, _P.\r\n   graminis_, described above; _P. rubigo_, which also infests\r\n   various Grasses, but whose æcidia appear on _Anchusa_; the\r\n   masses of teleutospores are small; they contain paraphyses, and\r\n   are for a long time covered by the epidermis. _P. coronata_, on\r\n   Oats and Rye Grass; its æcidia on _Rhamnus_; the teleutospores\r\n   are surmounted by a crown--“coronate processes.” _P.\r\n   phragmitis_, on Reeds; æcidia on species of _Rumex_ and _Rheum_.\r\n   _P. moliniæ_, on _Molinia cœrulea_; the æcidia on Orchids.\r\n   _P. poarum_, on Meadow-Grass; æcidia on _Tussilago_. Various\r\n   Puccinias growing on species of _Carex_ have their æcidia on\r\n   _Urtica_, _Lysimachia_, _Cirsium_, _Pedicularis_, etc.--Of\r\n   those AUTŒCIOUS species, which have all their generations on the\r\n   same host, may be noted:--_P. galii_, _P. menthæ_, _P. violæ_,\r\n   _P. epilobii_, _P. asparagi_, which grow on the hosts from\r\n   which they have taken their specific names.--As representative\r\n   of a group which have spermogonia, uredo-and teleutospores on\r\n   the same host, but on different individuals, _P. suaveolens_,\r\n   on the Field-Thistle, may be mentioned. The spermogonia have\r\n   a strong odour.--A peculiar group (_Leptopuccinia_) has only\r\n   teleutospores, which germinate immediately, and whilst still\r\n   attached to their living host. To this group belong _P.\r\n   arenariæ_, on a number of Caryophyllaceæ; and _P. malvacearum_,\r\n   on various Malvaceæ, introduced in 1873 from South America to\r\n   Europe, where it soon proved very destructive to Hollyhocks.\r\n\r\n   _Uromyces_ (Fig. 149) differs only from _Puccinia_ in always\r\n   having unicellular teleutospores. Among this genus both\r\n   heterœcious and autœcious species are found. To the first\r\n   group belong _U. pisi_, whose æcidia are found on _Euphorbia\r\n   cyparissias_, and _U. dactylidis_, whose æcidia appear on\r\n   _Ranunculus_; to the second group belong _U. betæ_, _U.\r\n   phaseoli_, _U. trifolii_.\r\n\r\n   _Triphragmium_ has teleutospores with three cells (one below and\r\n   two above), on _Spiræa ulmaria_.\r\n\r\n   _Phragmidium_ (Fig. 150) has teleutospores consisting of a\r\n   row of cells (3–10) arranged in a straight line; the upper\r\n   cell has one germ-pore and the others four germ-pores placed\r\n   equatorially. Both this and the preceding genus have large,\r\n   irregular æcidia without peridia, but often with bent, club-like\r\n   paraphyses (150 _b_ and _c_); they are all autœcious, and are\r\n   only found on the Rosaceæ.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 148.--_Gymnosporangium sabinæ_.

The\r\nfruit-bodies are partly _gymnocarpic_ (in the first 3 orders and in\r\nsome Agaricaceæ), partly _hemiangiocarpic_ (in orders 3–6 of the\r\nHymenomycetes and in the Phalloideæ, the fruit-bodies in these orders\r\nare in the young conditions more or less angiocarpic, but later on\r\ngenerally open below and bear the hymenium on the under surface of the\r\nfruit-body), partly also _angiocarpic_ (in the Gasteromycetes).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 162.--_Dacryomyces deliquescens_: I\r\n  fruit-body (nat. size); II vertical section through the hymenium;\r\n  III germinating basidiospore; IV a portion of mycelium with\r\n  conidia; V a germinating conidium; VI and VII chains of oidia\r\n  more or less strongly magnified; VIII basidiospore of _D.\r\n  longisporus_; IX germinating basidiospore of _D. ovisporus_;\r\n  X and XI _Calocera viscosa_; X fruit-body (nat. size); XI\r\n  basidia with basidiospores (highly magnified); XII _Dacryomitra\r\n  glossoides_ (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 1. =Dacryomycetes.=\r\n\r\nThe _long, club-shaped basidia_ bear _two tapering sterigmata_, which\r\ndevelope remarkably large basidiospores (Fig. 162 II, XI) and form\r\n_gymnocarpic_ fruit-bodies with hymenium. 1 order:\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Dacryomycetaceæ.= This order comprises 4 genera of which the\r\nfirst two develope the hymenium on the whole surface of the fruit-body,\r\nbut the two last only on its apex.\r\n\r\n   _Dacryomyces_: the folded, gelatinous, _Tremella_-like\r\n   fruit-bodies break out in winter on dried wood (hedges) in\r\n   the form of red or yellow drops. _D. deliquescens_ is very\r\n   common (Fig. 121). The following genera have cartilaginous\r\n   fruit-bodies.--_Calocera_ (Fig. 162), with club-like, simple,\r\n   or branched, _Clavaria_-like, fruit-bodies; the orange coloured\r\n   fruit-bodies of _C. viscosa_ grow aggregated together on the\r\n   wood of Conifers.--_Guepinia_ resembles a _Peziza_, and has\r\n   the hymenium only on the hollow upper surface.--_Dacryomitra_\r\n   resembles a _Mitrula_ (Fig. 162).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 2. =Hymenomycetes.=\r\n\r\nThis family is very rich in species (more than 8000 have been\r\ndescribed), and to it belong all the “Mushrooms” and “Toadstools.”\r\nThe _fruit-bodies_ present very various forms; they are generally\r\nfleshy, very perishable, seldom leathery or corky, in the last case\r\noften perennial. The _basidia_ are more or less _cylindrical_ and bear\r\n_generally_ 4 (seldom 2, 6 or 8) _sterigmata and basidiospores_. The\r\nhymenium in the fully-formed fruit-bodies lies free on the surface: in\r\norders 1 and 2 and a portion of order 6 it is from the commencement\r\nexposed, fruit-bodies _gymnocarpic_; orders 3–6 have _hemiangiocarpic_\r\nfruit-bodies (p. 157). In the first order the basidia (or the\r\nhymenium) are developed immediately from the mycelium (Fig. 163); the\r\nfruit-bodies of orders 2 and 3 present a higher grade of development,\r\nand have between the mycelium and hymenium a special hyphal-tissue,\r\na _stroma_, which is crustaceous, club-like, or coralloid, etc.,\r\nand in general bears the hymenium on the largest part of the free,\r\nsmooth surface. In the forms most highly developed (orders 4–6) a\r\nnew tissue--the _hymenophore_--is introduced between the stroma and\r\nhymenium, which appears on the under side of the fruit-body in the\r\nform of warts, projections, tubes, folds or lamellæ (Figs. 166, 167,\r\n174 _bc_). _Paraphyses_ are frequently found in the hymenium, among\r\nthe basidia. In the Hymenomycetes few examples of _conidia_ can be\r\nrecognised at first. More frequently _chlamydospores_ are found,\r\nparticularly _oidia_. The _mycelium_ is richly branched, generally\r\ncolourless, often perennial; it lives in humus or decaying wood, and is\r\nseldom parasitic. The hyphæ generally have clamp-connections and unite,\r\nsometimes, to form a rhizomorpha (Fig. 177) or sclerotia with coloured,\r\npseudo-parenchymatous covering.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 163.--_Exobasidium vaccinii._ I\r\n  Hypertrophied stem of _Vaccinium vitis idæa_; II leaf with\r\n  gall-like swelling; III section of II; IV transverse section: _m_\r\n  mycelium between the parenchymatous cells; _p_ hypodermal cells;\r\n  _e_ epidermis with basidia in various stages of development; V\r\n  epidermis with germinating spores; VI and VII spores germinating\r\n  in water (IV-VII × 620).]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Tomentellaceæ.= To this order belong the simplest of the\r\nHymenomycetes. The basidia (Fig. 145) arise free and irregularly\r\nfrom the mycelium; a _hymenium_ is _entirely absent_ or _very\r\nslightly formed_ (in _Corticium_ it attains its highest development);\r\n_fruit-bodies_ are _also wanting_.--In general they form flaky,\r\nmembranous or leathery coverings on bark and wood. Some are parasites.\r\n\r\n   _Hypochnus_ without conidia.--_Tomentella_ with conidiophores;\r\n   growing on wood or earth.--_Exobasidium vaccinii_ (Fig. 163),\r\n   a parasite on _Vaccinium_, _Andromeda_, _Arctostaphylos_, and\r\n   _Rhododendron_, forms flaky-powdery, white or red coverings and\r\n   may cause hypertrophy of the parts attacked. _E. warmingii_ is\r\n   parasitic on _Saxifraga_; _E. lauri_ causes outgrowths on the\r\n   stem of _Laurus canariensis_ as long as a finger, which formerly\r\n   were regarded as aerial roots.--_Corticium_ forms membranous\r\n   to leathery layers or crusts; _C. quercinum_ on wood and bark,\r\n   particularly Oak, is flesh-coloured; _C. cæruleum_ has a blue\r\n   hymenium; _C. giganteum_ on the bark of fallen Pine-trees.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Clavariaceæ.= The hymenium is situated on a stroma, and\r\neither completely _covers the smooth surface_ of the more or less\r\nfleshy _gymnocarpic fruit-body_, or is confined to a tolerably well\r\ndefined _upper portion_ of it (_Typhula_). Paraphyses absent. The\r\nvertical, white, yellow, or red fruit-bodies are roundish or club-like,\r\nundivided or richly branched (Fig. 125). Generally on the ground in\r\nwoods, seldom on tree-stems, etc.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 164.--_Clavaria coralloides_ (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n   GENERA: _Clavaria_, generally large Fungi with thick, round\r\n   branches. _C. botrytis_ has a very thick, tubercular stem with\r\n   numerous short, flesh-coloured branches: it has an agreeable\r\n   taste. _C. coralloides_ has a brittle, richly-branched\r\n   fruit-body (Fig. 164); basidia with two large spores. _C.\r\n   pistillaris_ consists of a single, undivided club of a\r\n   yellowish-white colour.--_Sparassis_ has compressed, leaf-like,\r\n   curled branches; _S. crispa_ has fruit-bodies as large as\r\n   a white cabbage-head, with an agreeable taste.--_Typhula_\r\n   and _Pistillaria_ are small Fungi with filamentous stalks,\r\n   terminating in a small club. The fruit-bodies of the former\r\n   often arise from a small, spheroid sclerotium; the latter is\r\n   distinguished by the basidia bearing only two spores.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Thelephoraceæ.= The hymenium is placed on a stroma and\r\n_covers the smooth surface_ of the leathery _hemiangiocarpic\r\nfruit-body_, generally _on its under side_. The edge of the stroma,\r\nwhich bounds the hymenium, is sometimes especially developed\r\n(_Stereum_). Saprophytes.\r\n\r\n   GENERA: _Thelephora_. The fruit-bodies in this genus are brown,\r\n   very irregularly shaped, and often lobed. The spores too are\r\n   brown, but in the other genera colourless. The species are found\r\n   growing on barren soil. _T. laciniata_ (Fig. 165) has imbricate,\r\n   semicircular, dark-brown pileus, which is jagged at the edge\r\n   and upper surface. The fruit-bodies are very often raised above\r\n   the ground, and although this species is not a parasite, yet\r\n   it destroys young seedlings by growing above and smothering\r\n   them.--_Stereum_ has a stiffer fruit-body, with a distinct,\r\n   fibrous, intermediate layer. It grows on bark and wood,\r\n   projecting like a series of imbricate brackets. _S. hirsutum_\r\n   is yellow; its free edge is provided with a number of stiff\r\n   hairs, the upper surface being divided into a number of zones.\r\n   _S. purpureum_ has a red-violet hymenium which distinguishes\r\n   it from the previous species.--_Cyphella_ has a membranous\r\n   cup- or bell-shaped fruit-body, often borne on a stalk, the\r\n   concave surface being covered with the hymenium. They are small,\r\n   white Fungi, growing on Moss and dead stems.--_Solenia_ is\r\n   closely related to _Cyphella_; its fruit-bodies are smaller and\r\n   hairy; they are found clustered together forming a crust-like\r\n   covering on dead wood.--_Craterellus_ has a large, funnel-shaped\r\n   fruit-body, the hymenium covering the external surface.\r\n   _C. cornucopioides_ is shaped like a trumpet or a “horn of\r\n   plenty.” It is dark-grey, several inches in height, and grows\r\n   gregariously on the ground in forests. It is distinguished by\r\n   the basidia bearing only two sterigmata.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 165.--_Thelephora laciniata_ (nat. size).]\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Hydnaceæ.= The fruit-body is most frequently fleshy, and\r\nvaries considerably in shape, the simplest forms being resupinate,[14]\r\nthe higher ones umbrella-like. The _hymenophore_ is found on the\r\nfree or downward-turned surface, and always takes the _form of soft\r\nemergences_ hanging vertically downwards. The emergencies may be\r\nthorn-, awl-, or wart-like. The species are found growing on the soil\r\nand on dead wood.\r\n\r\n   GENERA: _Hydnum_ has subulate, distinct emergences. _H.\r\n   repandum_ is yellow, the stalk being placed in the centre of the\r\n   pileus. It is an edible species, and often forms “fairy rings”\r\n   in woods. _H. auriscalpium_ (Fig. 166) is dark-brown, with stalk\r\n   placed at the edge of the pileus. It grows on old Fir-cones. _H.\r\n   erinaceus_ grows on old tree-trunks. The fruit-body is yellow\r\n   and very large--as big as a human head--with emergences as much\r\n   as an inch in length.--_Irpex_ has a leathery fruit-body, partly\r\n   resupinate, partly with free, projecting edge; the under side\r\n   bears tooth-like emergences which are arranged in rows, and\r\n   _Irpex_ thus forms a transition to the Agaricaceæ.--_Phlebia_\r\n   is entirely resupinate, with radially-arranged folds on the free\r\n   side, and pectinate border.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 166.--_Hydnum auriscalpium_, upon a Fir-cone,\r\n  in different stages of development.]\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Polyporaceæ (Pore-Fungi).= An order very rich in species\r\n(about 2000 species are described). The fruit-body is of very\r\ndifferent forms--resupinate, projecting like a bracket, hoof-like, or\r\numbrella-shaped. In some it is fleshy and edible, in others leathery or\r\ncorky, persisting for several years. The hymenophore is situated on the\r\nunder side of the fruit-body, and consists of wide or narrow _tubes_ or\r\n_pores_, whose inner surface is clothed with the hymenium (Fig. 167).\r\nIn some fruit-bodies large cavities are to be found, which have arisen\r\nas interstices between the labyrinthine curved and reticulate folds.\r\nChlamydospores are known in some species. Conidia occur very rarely.\r\nMany species work considerable damage: some as parasites on trees,\r\nothers by destroying timber.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 167.--_Polyporus igniarius._ Section through\r\n  the under side of the Fungus: _h-h_ is hyphal-tissue between the\r\n  tubes, formed by irregularly felted hyphæ, many of which are seen\r\n  cut across; _s_ is the hymenium which covers the walls of the\r\n  tubes, and from which the basidia with the spores protrude.]\r\n\r\n   GENERA. _Polyporus_ (Pore-Fungus). The tubes are narrow,\r\n   accurately fitted together, and forming a thick layer on the\r\n   under side of the fruit-body, appearing as a number of fine\r\n   holes. The fruit-body most frequently resembles a bracket, or\r\n   is hoof-shaped, with one side growing from a tree-trunk; it\r\n   is very often perennial, and a new layer of tubes arises in\r\n   each succeeding period of vegetation. Strata, corresponding\r\n   to the periodically interrupted growth, are thus formed in\r\n   storeys one above the other, and are visible on the upper\r\n   surface of the fruit-body, as well as in the interior, as a\r\n   series of concentric belts, sometimes as many as half a score\r\n   or more in number. _P. fomentarius_ (Touchwood) attacks\r\n   trees, especially the Beech. The spores germinate on wounds\r\n   from broken branches, and the hyphæ, following the course of\r\n   the medullary rays, find their way into the interior of the\r\n   tree, from whence the mycelium spreads upwards, downwards, and\r\n   peripherally, so that the wood becomes rotten (“white-rot”) and\r\n   thick felts of mycelium are formed in radial and tangential\r\n   directions. A dark line, caused by the youngest parts of the\r\n   hyphæ containing a brown juice, marks the boundary between\r\n   the rotten and the unattacked parts of the stem (Fig. 168);\r\n   at places where the mycelium extends to the bark, the cambium\r\n   becomes destroyed and further growth is arrested, so that\r\n   longitudinal furrows arise on the stem. It is at these places,\r\n   too, that the hoof-shaped, ash-coloured fruit-bodies are\r\n   developed, which may attain a circumference of upwards of 7\r\n   feet. The interior of the fruit-body consists of a dried-up,\r\n   loosely felted, red-brown mass of hyphæ, which has been used for\r\n   tinder and as a styptic (“Fungus chirurgorum”). _P. igniarius_\r\n   has a harder, dark-brown, more rounded fruit-body; it grows in\r\n   a similar manner, but especially attacks Oaks, Poplars, and\r\n   Plum-trees, the wood of which becomes rotten, and is called\r\n   touchwood. _P. pini_ (_Trametes pini_), (Fig. 170), a parasite\r\n   on the stems of _Pinus_, causes a kind of “red-rot” in the\r\n   stem. _P. sulphureus_ has a soft, cheesy, yellow fruit-body;\r\n   it produces “rot” in Oaks and Apple-trees. _P. officinalis_,\r\n   Larch-fungus (“Fungus Laricis” in Pharmocopœia), grows on\r\n   Larch-trees in the south-east of Europe. _P. versicolor_ has\r\n   thin, semicircular fruit-bodies, with zones of various colours\r\n   on the upper side; it is one of the most frequent species on\r\n   tree-stems. _P. frondosus_ grows on soil in woods, and consists\r\n   of numerous aggregated fruit-bodies, which become very large\r\n   and fleshy. This species is edible. _P. perennis_ also grows on\r\n   the soil in woods; it is very leathery, with central stalk, and\r\n   has concentric zones on the upper surface of the fruit-body.\r\n   _P. vaporarius_ destroys the wood of living Pines (_Pinus\r\n   silvestris_) and Firs (_Picea excelsa_), causing it to become\r\n   red-brown; in timber this Fungus causes “red-strip” followed by\r\n   a “dry-rot.” _P. squamosus_ destroys many Walnut-trees, and is\r\n   also very destructive to Limes and Elms. _P. fulvus_ causes a\r\n   “white-rot” in _Abies alba_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 168.--Section of stem of a Beech attacked by\r\n  _P. fomentarius_: _a_ non-attacked parts of the stem; _b_ the\r\n  furrows where the mycelium has reached the bark, and where the\r\n  thick mycelium-strands reach the exterior (⅙th of the nat. size).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 169.--Base of a Fir-tree, with a number of\r\n  fruit-bodies of _Heterobasidion annosum_ just beneath the surface\r\n  of the soil, indicated by the dotted line (¼th nat. size).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 170.--A fully developed fruit-body of\r\n  _Polyporus pini_ (_Trametes pini_), lateral view (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n   _Heterobasidion annosum_ (_Polyporus annosus_, _Trametes\r\n   radiciperda_, Fig. 169) is characterized by its\r\n   _Aspergillus_-like conidiophores. It is a parasite on the\r\n   Pine, Fir, Birch, Beech, etc., and is the chief cause of a\r\n   root-disease (red-rot) in Pines and Firs; the fruit-bodies\r\n   develope a large number of basidiospores; they may be very large\r\n   and are found just beneath the surface of the soil (on living or\r\n   dead roots), and exposed to the air (on felled stems and roots,\r\n   in Scandinavia).\r\n\r\n   _Ptychogaster_ has cushion-like fruit-bodies, which consist\r\n   chiefly of chlamydospore-chains, formed of ellipsoidal spores,\r\n   which alternate with short hyphæ having transverse septa and\r\n   clamp-connections. The hymenial portion is limited to a small\r\n   group of tubes. _Pt. albus_ (_Oligorus ustilaginoides_) grows\r\n   on stumps of Conifers and forms irregular cushions, at first\r\n   white and later on brown, which consist almost entirely of\r\n   chlamydospores.\r\n\r\n   _Boletus_ (Fig. 171) has a fleshy fruit-body resembling a common\r\n   Mushroom, with central stalk. The layer of tubes is easily\r\n   detached from the pileus, and the tubes are easily separable\r\n   from one another. They grow on the ground in woods. Edible\r\n   species are: _B. edulis_, with thick, reticulate stalk; _B.\r\n   scaber_, with thin stalk and rough pileus; _B. luteus_, with a\r\n   ring on the stalk. _B. luridus_ is poisonous, its tubes have\r\n   red openings, and the flesh turns quickly blue when broken and\r\n   exposed to the air.\r\n\r\n   _Fistulina hepatica_ (Beef-steak Fungus), has a red, fleshy,\r\n   edible fruit-body, with red juice. The tubes are individually\r\n   distinct; conidia are also developed. Grows on old Oaks.\r\n\r\n   _Merulius lacrymans_ (“Dry-rot”) has a resupinate fruit-body\r\n   with white, cotton-like border, and the remaining portions\r\n   covered by reticulate, ramified veins of a rust-brown colour.\r\n   In favourable vegetative conditions it is fleshy and exudes\r\n   large drops of water--hence its specific name and also the name\r\n   “Tear Fungus.” The mycelium is at first colourless, and then\r\n   yellow-brown; when dry it is tough and leathery. It destroys\r\n   the timber in damp houses, extends far and wide over boards and\r\n   beams and even over the masonry, giving rise to a disagreeable\r\n   smell in the rooms in which it lodges. In woods the Fungus lives\r\n   on Pine-stems. It is brought from the forest on the logs of\r\n   timber, and is distributed from log to log by the mycelium and\r\n   the basidiospores. The living mycelium can be recognised by the\r\n   clamp-connections shooting out branches. The basidiospores are\r\n   often ejected a distance of a metre; they are elliptical (10–11µ\r\n   long and 5–6µ broad), and germinate easily on damp wood, or in\r\n   fruit-juice which has been neutralized with urine or alkaline\r\n   carbonates.\r\n\r\n   _Dædalea_ (Labyrinth Fungus), has bracket-like, corky\r\n   fruit-bodies with irregularly-folded plates or discs on the\r\n   under side. It forms a transition to the Agaricaceæ. _D.\r\n   quercina_ is frequent on Oak-stumps.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 171.--_Boletus edulis_ (about ¼th): _b_\r\n  longitudinal section of a portion of the pileus.]\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Agaricaceæ= (=Mushrooms=, =Toadstools=). _The hymenophore\r\nconsists_ of knife-like plates (_lamellæ_, _gills_), which are situated\r\non the under side of the umbrella-like pileus of the fruit-body, and\r\nradiate from the central stalk. Those which are first formed extend\r\nfrom the edge of the pileus to the stalk; those formed later reach only\r\na longer or shorter portion of this distance, according to their age.\r\nIn structure the lamellæ (Fig. 174) consist of a central mass of hyphæ,\r\nthe _trama_, continuous with the hyphæ of the pileus; these terminate\r\nin a layer of shorter cells, the _subhymenial layer_, immediately\r\nbeneath the hymenium which is composed of basidia and paraphyses. In a\r\nfew species, but not in the majority, the lamellæ are branched, and in\r\nsome they are decurrent. A few have the stalk placed excentrically, or\r\nit may be entirely absent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 172.--Development of _Psalliota campestris_:\r\n  _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ show the various stages of the development\r\n  of the fruit-bodies and the mycelium (_m_) (nat. size); _e_ the\r\n  fruit-body in a somewhat later stage, slightly magnified; _f_\r\n  longitudinal section of _e_; _n_ first formation of the hymenium;\r\n  _g_ longitudinal section of a more advanced fruit-body (nat.\r\n  size); _n_ the hymenium; _o_ velum partiale (see Fig. 133.)]\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of its development the fruit-body is more or\r\nless enclosed in a hyphal tissue--the “veil” (_velum universale_, or\r\n_volva_). The veil at first completely encloses the young fruit-body,\r\nbut is afterwards ruptured as the latter grows, part remaining at the\r\nbase of the stalk as the “sheath” (_annulus inferus_), and part on the\r\npileus as scales or warts. In the “Fly Mushroom” (_Amanita muscaria_)\r\nthe remains of the veil are especially conspicuous as white patches\r\non the bright red ground of the upper surface of the pileus, and as\r\na sheath at the base of the stalk (Fig. 178 _v._). Another veil--the\r\n_velum partiale_--a hyphal tissue (Figs. 178 _a_; 173) stretches from\r\nthe edge of the pileus to the stalk, and encloses the lamellæ. This\r\nveil is ruptured as the pileus expands, a portion attached to the stalk\r\nremaining as the “upper ring” (_annulus superus_) (Figs. 173, 178 _a_),\r\nor a part attached to the pileus hanging down as a fringe round its\r\nedge.--Some genera have no veil, the under side of the pileus being\r\nexposed from the first (_gymnocarpic_ Agaricaceæ). Those which have\r\na veil (_hemiangiocarpic_ A.) afford a transition to the angiocarpic\r\nGasteromycetes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 173.--The cultivated Mushroom (_Psalliota\r\n  campestris_).]\r\n\r\nThe mycelium mostly grows in soils rich in humus or dung, on decaying\r\ntrees and similar objects. Many species, _e.g. Tricholoma personatum_\r\nand _Marasmius oreades_, form the so-called “fairy rings.” The\r\nfruit-bodies in these species are confined to a larger or smaller\r\nsurface on which they are very regularly arranged in a ring. The reason\r\nfor this is found in the radial growth of the mycelium, so that the\r\noldest portion, or the starting point, is found at the centre of the\r\nring, and the younger ones, on which the fruit-bodies are formed, at\r\nthe circumference. The older hyphæ gradually die, and at the same time,\r\nthe radial growth continuing, the ring of fruit-bodies becomes larger\r\nand larger. The “fairy-rings” are marked not only by the fruit-bodies,\r\nbut also by the more vigorous growth and darker colour of the grass\r\nupon these spots.\r\n\r\nSome species are _parasites_. An example is presented by _Armillaria\r\nmellea_, a remarkable and very destructive Fungus in woods and forests\r\n(Figs. 176, 177). ~In addition to the filamentous, white mycelium,\r\nit has also black, or black-brown, horny, root-like mycelium-strands\r\n(rhizomorpha) which were formerly considered to belong to a special\r\ngenus of Fungi described under the name “_Rhizomorpha_.” The mycelium\r\nlives parasitically on the Conifers and other trees, forcing its hyphæ\r\ninto the bark and between the bark and wood, and thence penetrating\r\ninto the wood so that the tree is very severely attacked. It may also\r\nlive saprophytically, and clusters of fruit-bodies are often found on\r\nold stumps and stems, on old timber, and in the rich soil of woods. The\r\nrhizomorpha, living underground, can extend for considerable distances\r\nand infect the roots of neighbouring trees, and spreads in this way\r\nthe diseases known as “Harzsticken” and “Bark-Canker,” which are very\r\ndestructive to young trees.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 174.--_Psalliota campestris.

The\r\n   FOLLOWING HAVE WHITE SPORES:--_Amanita_ (Fly Mushroom), with\r\n   volva, and generally also the upper ring on the stalk; many are\r\n   poisonous, such as _A. muscaria_ (Fig. 178) which has bright red\r\n   pileus with white spots, _A. pantherina_ and _A. phalloides_;\r\n   _A. cæsarea_ is edible.--_Lepiota procera_ (Parasol Fungus)\r\n   is one of the largest Mushrooms; it has a scaly pileus and\r\n   moveable ring (edible).--_Armillaria mellea_ has been mentioned\r\n   above (Figs. 176, 177).--_Tricholoma_, lamellæ indented near\r\n   the stalk; _T. gambosum_ (Pomona Fungus) belongs to the best\r\n   of edible Fungi; _T. personatum_ often forms fairy rings (see\r\n   above).--_Clitocybe_, lamella decurrent; _C. nebularis_ is\r\n   edible.--_Pleurotus_, stalk eccentric; _P. ostreatus_ (Oyster\r\n   Mushroom) grows in clusters on tree-stems (edible).--_Collybia_\r\n   and _Mycena_, species numerous, small.--SPORES ROSE-RED:\r\n   _Volvaria_ and _Hyporhodius_.--SPORES BROWN: _Cortinarius_,\r\n   with cobweb-like veil; _Pholiota_, membranous veil and ring;\r\n   _P. squarrosa_ in clusters on tree-stems; _P. mutabilis_, on\r\n   tree-stumps (edible).--SPORES VIOLET-PURPLE: _Hypholoma_,\r\n   _Psalliota_; to this section the common edible Mushroom (Fig.\r\n   172–174) belongs, with annulus and chocolate-coloured lamellæ;\r\n   it is cultivated for the sake of the fine flavour.--SPORES\r\n   BLACK: _Coprinarius_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 178.--Fly Mushroom (_Amanita muscaria_).]\r\n\r\n   2. =Marasmiei.= Fruit-body tough, almost leathery, and\r\n   persistent; spores white. _Marasmius oreades_ forms large,\r\n   regular fairy-rings on pastures and commons; it is used as\r\n   seasoning in food.--_Panus stipticus_ with eccentrically-placed\r\n   stalk, in clusters on tree-stumps.--_Schizophyllum_ has the edge\r\n   of the lamellæ divided longitudinally, and the split portions\r\n   revolute.--_Lentinus_ affords a transition to _Dædalea_ among\r\n   the Polyporaceæ.\r\n\r\n   3. =Russulei.= Fruit-body fleshy and fragile, in which two\r\n   different systems of hyphæ may be distinguished; spores thorny,\r\n   white, or pale-yellow. Many are poisonous.--_Russula_ has\r\n   generally fragile and thick lamellæ reaching from stalk to edge\r\n   of pileus; pileus frequently red.--_Lactarius_ has white or\r\n   yellow milky juice, which often is very acid. _L. deliciosus_\r\n   has red-yellow milky juice, and is of a pleasant flavour. _L.\r\n   torminosus_ is poisonous.\r\n\r\n   4. =Hygrophorei.= Lamellæ thick and waxy, widely separated;\r\n   spores white. Many species of _Hygrophorus_ have\r\n   brightly-coloured pileus and grow among the grass on moors and\r\n   commons.--_Nyctalis_ is parasitic on larger Toadstools. It is\r\n   remarkable for its abundant formation of chlamydospores, whilst\r\n   the basidiospores are little developed.\r\n\r\n   5. =Coprinei.= Fruit-bodies very soft, quickly perishable;\r\n   lamellæ membranous and deliquescent. The basidia are separated\r\n   from each other by paraphyses. _Coprinus_ has coal-black spores,\r\n   grows on manure, and sometimes developes sclerotia.\r\n\r\n   6. =Paxillei.= Fruit-body fleshy; lamellæ easily detached from\r\n   the pileus and reticulately-joined near the stalk. They form a\r\n   connecting link between the Agaricaceæ and _Boletus_.\r\n\r\n   7. =Cantharellei.= Lamellæ reduced to dichotomously-divided\r\n   folds, decurrent on the stalk. _Cantharellus cibarius_ (Fig.\r\n   175) is yolk-yellow, and grows on the ground in woods (edible).\r\n   It is allied to _Craterellus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 3. =Phalloideæ.=\r\n\r\nThe fruit-bodies before they are ripe are spherical or ovoid, and\r\nenclosed by a _fleshy covering_, the peridium, which is _perforated\r\nat maturity_ and remains as a sheath (Fig. 179); the fruit-bodies are\r\n_hemiangiocarpic_.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Phallaceæ= (=Stink-horns=). The peridium has a complicated\r\nstructure and is composed of three layers, the intermediate one being\r\nthick and gelatinous. The gleba (the tissue which bears the hymenium)\r\nis situated upon a peculiar receptacle which expands into a porous\r\nstalk and by its sudden distension, rupturing the peridium, elevates\r\nthe gleba and hymenium above the peridium, which remains as a sheath.\r\n_The gleba becomes gelatinous and dissolves away as drops._ To this\r\norder belong many peculiar and often brightly coloured forms, which are\r\nnatives of the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n   _Phallus impudicus_ (Stink-horn) (Fig. 179), has a fruit-body\r\n   which at first is white, heavy, and soft, and resembles a hen’s\r\n   egg in shape and size. The peridium is divided into three layers\r\n   (Fig. 179 _e_, _g_, _f_) of which the external and internal\r\n   are membranous, and the middle one very thick and gelatinous;\r\n   each of these has again a laminated structure. The peridium\r\n   when ruptured remains as a sheath (_k_) at the base of the\r\n   stalk. The receptacle at first is strongly compressed (_h_)\r\n   but afterwards expands into a long stalk (_l_) which bears the\r\n   conical gleba (_m_). Prior to the rupture of the peridium the\r\n   gleba consists of a greenish mass (_i_) which, when exposed,\r\n   emits a carrion-like stench serving to attract flies, by whose\r\n   agency the spores are distributed. It is found commonly in\r\n   hedgerows and in woods, growing on the ground. The much smaller\r\n   and less common _P. caninus_ is found on rotten tree-stumps.--In\r\n   _Clathrus cancellatus_ the receptacle expands into a bright red,\r\n   reticulate structure. A native of the South of Europe. _Colus_,\r\n   _Aseroë_, _Mitromyces_.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Sphærobolaceæ.= An intermediate layer of the\r\n   _peridium_ swells when ripe, becomes convex, and _ejects the\r\n   remaining_ spherical _portion of the fruit-body_ which contains\r\n   the spores. _Sphærobolus carpobolus_ has small, spherical\r\n   fruit-bodies which open in the form of a star.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 179.--_Phallus impudicus_ (Stink-horn),\r\n  somewhat diminished. Fruit-bodies in all stages of development\r\n  (_b_, _c_, _d_ and _k-m_) are seen arising from a root-like\r\n  mycelium (_a_); _d_ longitudinal sections through a fruit-body\r\n  before the covering has ruptured.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 4. =Gasteromycetes.=\r\n\r\nThe fruit-body is _angiocarpic_, fleshy at first, and later generally\r\nmore or less _hard_ and _continues closed after the_ spores _are\r\nripe_. The tissue lying immediately inside the _peridium_ is termed\r\nthe _gleba_; it is porous, containing a larger or smaller number of\r\nchambers lined with the hymenium, which is either a continuous layer of\r\nbasidia or else it fills up the entire cavity. The basidia as a rule\r\nbear four spores, sometimes eight (_Geaster_), or two (_Hymenogaster_).\r\nThe tissue of the walls (_trama_) consists often (_Lycoperdaceæ_)\r\nof two kinds of hyphæ, some thin and rich in protoplasm, divided\r\nby transverse septa and bearing the basidia; others thicker and\r\nthick-walled which do not dissolve like the former on the ripening of\r\nthe spores, but continue to grow and form a woolly, elastic mass, the\r\n_capillitium_, which may be regarded as highly developed paraphyses.\r\nThe peridium may be either single or double, and presents many\r\nvariations in its structure and dehiscence. The mycelium is generally a\r\nnumber of string-like strands, living in soils rich in humus.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Tylostomaceæ.= Capillitium present. After the rupture\r\n   of the peridium the remaining part of the fruit-body is elevated\r\n   on a long _stalk_. _Tylostoma mammosum_, on heaths.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Lycoperdaceæ.= The fruit-body has a double peridium; the\r\nexternal one at length breaks into fragments (_Lycoperdon_, _Bovista_),\r\nor it has a compound structure of several layers (_Geaster_) and\r\ndetaches itself as a continuous envelope from the inner layer, which\r\nis membranous and opens at its apex. The interior of the fruit-body\r\nconsists either solely of the fertile gleba (_Bovista_, _Geaster_),\r\nor, in addition, of a sterile tissue at the base (_Lycoperdon_). A\r\ncapillitium is also present.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 180.--_Lycoperdon gemmatum_ (½ nat. size).]\r\n\r\n   _Lycoperdon_ (Puff-ball) has a sterile part at the base of the\r\n   fruit-body which often forms a thick stalk. The surface of the\r\n   peridium is generally covered with warts or projections. When\r\n   young this Fungus is edible, but when ripe it is dry, and used\r\n   for stopping the flow of blood. _L. giganteum_, which is often\r\n   found growing in meadows, attains a considerable size, its\r\n   diameter reaching as much as eighteen inches. _L. gemmatum_\r\n   (Fig. 180) is covered with pyramidal warts; in woods.--_Bovista_\r\n   has no sterile basal part; the external peridium is smooth, and\r\n   falls away in irregular patches. _B. plumbea_, on links near the\r\n   sea.--_Geaster_ (Earth-star) has an external peridium composed\r\n   of several layers, which when the fruit-body opens, split into\r\n   several stellate segments. These segments are very hygroscopic,\r\n   and in dry weather bend backwards and so raise the inner\r\n   peridium into the air. The inner peridium contains the spores\r\n   and capillitia. _G. coliformis_ has several apertures in the\r\n   inner peridium. The other species have only one regular aperture\r\n   at the apex. _G. striatus_ has a pedicellate inner peridium,\r\n   with conical, striped peristome. _G. fornicatus_ has an external\r\n   peridium split into four segments. This last and several other\r\n   species produce “mycorhiza” on the roots of Conifers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 181.--I _Hymenogaster citrinus_ (nat. size);\r\n  II longitudinal section through _H. tener_ (× 5); III portion of\r\n  a section of _H. calosporus_; _g_ a chamber; _h_ hymenium; _sp._\r\n  spores; _t_ trama (× 178); IV _Rhizopogon luteolus_ (nat. size);\r\n  V _Scleroderma vulgare_, VI section of V; VII basidia with spores\r\n  belonging to the same Fungus.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Sclerodermataceæ.= _Capillitium_ wanting. The peridium is\r\nsimple and thick, gleba with round, closed chambers, which are filled\r\nwith basidia.\r\n\r\n   _Scleroderma_ has a corky peridium. The fruit-bodies commence\r\n   their development under ground. _S. vulgare_ (Fig. 181 V-VII),\r\n   has a hard, slaty-black gleba.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Nidulariaceæ= (=Nest-Fungi=). Small Fungi of which the\r\nfruit-body at first is spherical or cylindrical but upon maturity\r\nit becomes cupular or vase-like, and contains several lenticular\r\n“peridiola” lying like eggs in a nest. The peridiola are the chambers\r\nwhich contain the hymenium, covered by a thin layer of the gleba, all\r\nthe remaining portion of the gleba becoming dissolved. On decaying wood.\r\n\r\n   _Nidularia_ has spherical fruit-bodies containing a\r\n   large number of lenticular peridiola, embedded in a slimy\r\n   mass.--_Crucibulum_ has fruit-bodies resembling crucibles\r\n   with discoid peridiola, each with a spirally-twisted\r\n   stalk.--_Cyathus_ has a fruit-body, which when open is\r\n   campanulate, with stratified peridium, and long-stalked,\r\n   lense-shaped peridiola.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Hymenogastraceæ.= Fruit-bodies tubercular, globose and\r\nsubterranean, resembling very closely the Truffles, from which they\r\ncan only be distinguished with certainty by microscopic means. The\r\nperidium is simple, capillitium wanting, and the gleba encloses a\r\nsystem of labyrinthine passages covered with a continuous hymenium.\r\nThe fruit-bodies persist for some time, and form a fleshy mass, the\r\nspores being only set free by the decay of the fruit-body, or when it\r\nis eaten by animals. The majority are South European. _Hymenogaster_,\r\n_Melanogaster_, _Rhizopogon_ (Fig. 181 I-IV).\r\n\r\n\r\n                    APPENDIX TO THE BASIDIOMYCETES:\r\n\r\n           Basidiolichenes (Lichen-forming Basidiomycetes).\r\n\r\nSeveral Fungi belonging to the Basidiomycetes have a symbiotic\r\nrelationship with Algæ exactly similar to that enjoyed by certain\r\nAscomycetes, and these are therefore included under the term Lichens\r\n(p. 136). They are chiefly tropical.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Hymenolichenes.= To this order belong some gymnocarpic\r\nforms: _Cora_, _Dictyonema_, _Laudatea_.[15]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Gasterolichenes.= To this belong some angiocarpic forms:\r\n_Emericella_, _Trichocoma_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        APPENDIX TO THE FUNGI.\r\n\r\n             Fungi imperfecti (Incompletely known Fungi).\r\n\r\n1. The =Saccharomyces-forms= are Fungi which are only known in their\r\nyeast-conidial form. They are _conidia of higher Fungi_ which can\r\nmultiply to an unlimited extent by budding in nutritive solutions, and\r\nin this way maintain their _definite_ size and shape. The budding takes\r\nplace _only at the ends_ of the conidia. The wall of the conidium forms\r\nat one or at both ends a small wart-like outgrowth, which gradually\r\nbecomes larger, and is finally separated from its mother-cell as an\r\nindependent cell, surrounded by a closed cell-wall (Fig. 182 _a_, _b_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 182.--Beer-yeast (_Saccharomyces cerevisiæ_):\r\n  _a-b_ (× 400); _c-f_ (× 750); _c_ a cell in the process of\r\n  forming spores; _d_ a cell with four ripe spores; _e_ the\r\n  spores liberated by the dissolution of the cell-wall; _f_ three\r\n  germinating spores; _g_ mycelium-like cell-chains. (× 1000: after\r\n  Em. Chr. Hansen.)]\r\n\r\nUnder very favourable conditions multiplication occurs so rapidly that\r\nthe daughter-cells themselves commence to form buds, before they have\r\nseparated from their mother-cell, with the result that pearl-like\r\nchains of cells are produced. When the yeast-cells have only limited\r\nnutriment, with an abundant supply of air, at a suitable temperature,\r\nan endogenous formation of _spores_ takes place. The protoplasm of the\r\ncells divides into 1–4 (rarely a greater number) masses (Fig. 182 _c_,\r\n_d_, _e_) which surround themselves with a thick cell-wall, and in this\r\nstate can withstand adverse conditions and periods of dryness lasting\r\nfor several months.\r\n\r\nThe _sporangia are not asci_ since they have no definite form, and\r\na definite number, form and size of spores is not found. The spores\r\nin the different species and kinds occupy varying periods for their\r\ndevelopment, although exposed to the same temperature, a fact of\r\nimportance in determining one from another. On germination the wall of\r\nthe mother-cell is destroyed, and each spore gives rise to a new cell,\r\nmultiplication taking place by budding (Fig. 182 _f_). The majority of\r\nYeast-Fungi are able to produce alcoholic fermentation in saccharine\r\nfluids.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these Fungi is the Beer-yeast (_Saccharomyces\r\ncerevisiæ_) with ovate, ellipsoidal or spherical cells (Fig. 182). It\r\nis a plant which has been cultivated from time immemorial, on account\r\nof its property of producing alcoholic fermentation in sugar-containing\r\nextracts (wort), derived from germinating barley (malt). Carbonic\r\nacid is also set free during this process. The “surface-yeast” (Fig.\r\n182 _a_), which produces ordinary beer when the brewing takes place\r\nat higher temperatures, has cell-chains; “sedimentary yeast” (Fig.\r\n182 _b_), used in the brewing of Bavarian beer, has spherical cells,\r\nsolitary, or united in pairs. Both these and the following Yeast-Fungi\r\ninclude, according to Hansen, several species and kinds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 183.--_Saccharomyces mycoderma._]\r\n\r\nThe “Ferment of Wine” (_Saccharomyces ellipsoideus_) produces wine in\r\nthe juice of grapes. Uncultivated yeast-cells are always present on\r\ngrapes; an addition of this species to the “must” is not necessary to\r\nsecure fermentation. A large number of other “uncultivated” yeast-cells\r\nappear in breweries mixed with the cultivated ones, and cause different\r\ntastes to the beer (_S. pastorianus_, etc.). _S. ludwigii_, found,\r\nfor instance, on the slimy discharge from Oaks, produces abundant\r\ncell-chains on cultivation. _S. apiculatus_ is very frequently met with\r\non all kinds of sweet fruits, it has orange-like cells. _S. mycoderma_\r\nhas cylindrical cells, often united together in chains (Fig. 183): it\r\nforms a whitish-gray mass (“fleur de vin”) on wine, beer, fruit-juice,\r\netc., standing in bottles uncorked or not entirely filled. It is\r\nthought that this Fungus causes decomposition and oxydises the fluid\r\nin which it is found, but it cannot produce alcoholic fermentation\r\nin saccharine liquids, and it does not form endospores; hence it is\r\nuncertain whether it is true _Saccharomyces_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 184.--_Oidium lactis_: _a_ branched hypha\r\n  commonly met with; _b_ a hypha lying in milk and producing aerial\r\n  hyphæ which give rise to oidia; _c_ a branch giving rise to\r\n  oidia, the oldest (outermost) oidia are becoming detached from\r\n  one another; _d_ a chain of divided cells; _e_ germinating oidia\r\n  in different stages (slightly more magnified than the other\r\n  figures).]\r\n\r\nThe “Dry-yeast” used in baking white bread is “surface-yeast.” In\r\n_leaven_, a kneaded mixture of meal, barm and water, which is used for\r\nthe manufacture of black bread, _Saccharomyces minor_ is present, and\r\na species allied to this produces alcoholic fermentation in dough with\r\nthe evolution of carbonic acid, which causes the dough to “rise.”\r\n\r\n2. =Oidium-forms.= Of many Fungi only the Oidium-forms are known,\r\nwhich multiply in endless series without employing any higher form of\r\nreproduction. _Oidium lactis_ (Fig. 184) is an imperfectly developed\r\nform which frequently appears on sour milk and cheese. It can produce a\r\nfeeble alcoholic fermentation in saccharine liquids. Thrush or aphthæ\r\n(_O. albicans_) appears as white spots in the mouths of children.\r\nSeveral similar _Oidium-forms_ are parasites on the skin and hair\r\nof human beings, and produce skin diseases, such as scurvy (_O.\r\nschoenleinii_) and ringworm (_O. tonsurans_).\r\n\r\n3. =Mycorhiza.= These Fungi, which have been found on the roots of many\r\ntrees and heath-plants, particularly Cupuliferæ and Ericaceæ, consist\r\nof septate hyphæ, and belong partly to the Hymenomycetes, partly to\r\nthe Gasteromycetes. It has been shown that the Mycorhiza enters into a\r\nsymbiotic relationship with the roots of higher plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DIVISION II.\r\n\r\n                          MUSCINEÆ (MOSSES).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this Division a well-marked alternation of generations is\r\nto be found. The development of the first or sexual generation\r\n(_gametophyte_),[16] which bears the sexual organs, antheridia\r\nand archegonia, commences with the germination of the spore, and\r\nconsists, in the Liverworts, of a thallus, but in the true Mosses of a\r\nfilamentous protonema, from which the Moss-plant arises as a lateral\r\nbud. The second or asexual generation (_sporophyte_), developed from\r\nthe fertilised oosphere, consists of a sporangium and stalk.\r\n\r\n=The sexual generation, the gametophyte.= The protonema in the\r\nLiverworts is very insignificant, and not always very sharply\r\ndemarcated from the more highly developed parts of the nutritive\r\nsystem. In the true Mosses the protonema is well-developed, and\r\nconsists of a branched, alga-like filament of cells, the dividing\r\ncell-walls being always placed obliquely. In the parts exposed to the\r\nlight it is green, but colourless or brownish in those parts which are\r\nunderground (Fig. 186). The protonema is considered to be a lower form\r\nof the stem, and grows in the same manner by means of an apical cell;\r\nat its apex it may directly develope into a leaf-bearing stem, or these\r\narise from it as lateral branches (Fig. 186 _k_).\r\n\r\nThe more highly differentiated part of the vegetative system, the\r\n“Moss-plant,” which is thus developed from the protonema, is in the\r\n“thalloid” Liverworts generally a dichotomously-branched thallus\r\nwithout any trace of leaf-structures (Fig. 194); in _Marchantia_\r\n(Fig. 197) and others, scale-like leaves (_amphigastria_) are found\r\non the under surface. The higher Liverworts and the Leafy-Mosses are\r\ndifferentiated into a filamentous, ramified stem with distinct leaves\r\narranged in a definite manner, resembling the stem and leaves of the\r\nhigher plants (Figs. 186, 195, 200).\r\n\r\n_True roots are wanting_, but are biologically replaced by _rhizoids_.\r\nThese are developed on the stems or thallus: in the Liverworts they\r\nare unicellular, but in the Leafy-Mosses generally multicellular and\r\nbranched. In the latter group they are considered identical with\r\nthe protonema, and may become true protonema, and new plants may be\r\ndeveloped from them (Fig. 186 _b_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 186.--_A_ Lower portion of a Moss-plant with\r\n  rhizoids (_r_), one of which bears a reproductive bud (_b_). The\r\n  dotted line indicates the surface of the ground; the portions\r\n  projecting above this become green protonema (_p_); _k_ is a\r\n  young Moss-plant formed on one of these. _B_ Germinating spore of\r\n  _Funaria hygrometrica_, with exospore still attached. _C_, _D_\r\n  Older stages of the protonema.]\r\n\r\nThe internal structure of the sexual generation is very simple. The\r\nleaves in nearly all cases are formed of a single-layered plate of\r\ncells; in the Leafy-Mosses, however, a midrib is very often formed, and\r\nsometimes, also, marginal veins; and along these lines the leaves are\r\nseveral layers of cells in thickness. The stem is constructed of cells\r\nlongitudinally elongated, the external ones of which are narrower and\r\nsometimes have thicker walls than the more central ones. _Vessels are\r\nnot found_, but in several Mosses there is in the centre of the stem\r\na conducting strand of narrow, longitudinal cells, which represents\r\nthe vascular bundle in its first stage of development. This strand\r\ncontains elements for conveying water as well as sieve-tubes. Stomata\r\nare entirely wanting in the sexual generation of the Leafy-Mosses; they\r\nare found in a few Liverworts (_Marchantia_), but their structure is\r\nnot the same as in the higher plants.\r\n\r\nVEGETATIVE REPRODUCTION takes place by gemmæ or buds which arise on\r\nthe protenema, the rhizoids, the thallus, or the shoots, and become\r\ndetached from the mother-plant; or else the protonema and the older\r\nparts of the plant simply die off, and their branches thus become\r\nindependent plants. This well-developed vegetative reproduction\r\nexplains why so many Mosses grow gregariously. In certain Marchantiaceæ\r\nspecial cupules, in which gemmæ are developed, are found on the surface\r\nof the thallus (Fig. 197 _A_, _s-s_). Again, protonema may also arise\r\nfrom the leaves, and thus the leaves may act as reproductive bodies.\r\nCertain Mosses nearly always reproduce vegetatively, and in these\r\nspecies the oospheres are seldom fertilised.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 187.--_Marchantia polymorpha_: _a_ mature\r\n  antheridium.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 188.--Spermatozoids.]\r\n\r\nThe first generation bears the SEXUAL ORGANS; both kinds are found\r\neither on the same plant (monœcious), or on separate plants (diœcious).\r\nIn the thalloid Liverworts they are often situated on the apex of small\r\nstems (_gametophores_), springing from the surface of the thallus.\r\nIn the Leafy-Liverworts and true Mosses the leaves which enclose the\r\nsexual organs often assume a peculiar shape, and are arranged more\r\nclosely than the other leaves to form the so-called “Moss-flower.” The\r\nmale sexual organs are called _antheridia_. They are stalked, spheroid,\r\nclub- or egg-shaped bodies whose walls are formed of one layer of cells\r\n(Fig. 187), enclosing a mass of minute cubical cells, each one of which\r\nis a mother-cell of a spermatozoid. The spermatozoids are self-motile;\r\nthey are slightly twisted, with two cilia placed anteriorly (Fig. 188),\r\nwhile posteriorly they are generally a trifle club-shaped, and often\r\nbear at that part the remains of the cytoplasm, the spermatozoid itself\r\nbeing _formed from the nucleus_. In the presence of water the ripe\r\nantheridium bursts, and its contents are ejected; the spermatozoids,\r\nbeing liberated from their mother-cells, swarm about in the water in\r\norder to effect fertilisation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 189.--_Marchantia polymorpha. A_ A young,\r\n  and _B_ a ripe archegonium with open neck. _C_ An unripe\r\n  sporangium enclosed by the archegonium _a_: _st_ the stalk; _f_\r\n  the wall of the sporangium. Elaters are seen between the rows of\r\n  spores.]\r\n\r\nThe female sexual organs are termed _archegonia_. They are flask-shaped\r\nbodies (Fig. 189), the lower, swollen portion (_venter_) having a wall,\r\nin most cases from 1–2 cells thick, enclosing the oosphere (Fig. 189\r\n_B_, _k_): the long neck is formed of tiers of 4–6 cells, enclosing\r\na central row of cells--_the neck-canal-cells_ (Fig. 189 _A_). When\r\nthe archegonium is fully developed, the walls of the neck-canal-cells\r\nbecome mucilaginous and force open the neck of the archegonium. The\r\nmucilage thus escapes, and, remaining at the mouth of the archegonium,\r\nacts in a somewhat similar manner to the stigma and conducting tissue\r\nof a carpel, by catching and conducting the spermatozoids to the\r\noosphere (Fig. 189 _B_, _m_), with whose cell-nucleus they coalesce.\r\nWith regard to the formation of the oosphere, it may further be\r\nremarked that the lower part of the archegonium originally encloses the\r\nso-called “central cell”; but shortly before the archegonium is ripe,\r\nthis cuts off a small portion, _the ventral-canal-cell_, which lies\r\nimmediately beneath the neck, and the larger, lower portion becomes the\r\noosphere.\r\n\r\n   The organs mentioned here, antheridia and archegonia, are\r\n   present in the Cryptogams (Pteridophyta) and the Gymnosperms.\r\n   They have always the same fundamental structure, but with slight\r\n   modifications of detail. These plants are therefore known as the\r\n   ARCHEGONIATA.\r\n\r\nThe fertilisation of the Mosses cannot be effected without water. Rain\r\nand dew therefore play a very important part in this process, and for\r\nthis end various modifications of structure are found.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 190.--_Andreæa rupestris._ Longitudinal\r\n  section through a sporangium at the time when the mother-cells\r\n  of the spores are dividing: _p_ pseudopodium; _f_ foot; _v_\r\n  vaginula; _h_ neck; _c_ columella; _w_ wall of the sporangium;\r\n  _e_ external row of cells; _s_ the spore-sac; _t_ the\r\n  spore-mother-cells; _r_ the calyptra with the neck of archegonium\r\n  (_z_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 191.--_Andreæa rupestris._ Transverse\r\n  section through a ripe sporangium. In the middle is seen the\r\n  four-sided columella, surrounded by the numerous spores,\r\n  drawn diagrammatically. Surrounding them is seen the wall of\r\n  the sporangium, whose outer layer of cells is thickened and\r\n  coloured. The layer of cells is unthickened in four places (_x_),\r\n  indicating the position of the clefts (see Fig. 193).]\r\n\r\nAmong the sexual organs, paraphyses--filamentous or club-shaped\r\nbodies--are to be found.\r\n\r\n=The asexual generation, the sporophyte= (Moss-fruit or sporogonium).\r\nAs the result of fertilisation the oosphere surrounds itself with a\r\ncell-wall, and then commences to divide in accordance with definite\r\nlaws.[17] The embryo (Fig. 189 _C_) produced by these divisions\r\nremains inside the wall _a-a_ of the archegonium (Figs. 190, 199 _D_,\r\n_E_), and developes into the _sporogonium_, which remains attached\r\nto the mother-plant, often nourished by it, as if the two were one\r\norganism. The lower extremity of the sporogonium, _the foot_ (Figs.\r\n190 _f_; 199 _D_), very often forces its way deep down into the\r\ntissue of the mother-plant, but without an actual union taking place.\r\nThe central portion of the sporogonium becomes a shorter or longer\r\n_stalk_ (_seta_), while the sporangium itself is developed at the\r\nsummit. At a later stage, during the formation of the spores, the\r\nsporangium very often assumes the form of a _capsule_, and dehisces\r\nin several ways characteristic of the various genera (Figs. 192, 193,\r\n194, 195, 200). The basal portion of the archegonium grows for a\r\nlonger or shorter period, forming a sheath, the _calyptra_, in which\r\nthe capsule is developed, but eventually it ceases to enlarge, and\r\nis then ruptured in different ways, but quite characteristically, in\r\neach group. Anatomically, the asexual generation is often more highly\r\ndifferentiated than the sexual; thus, for instance, stomata are present\r\non the sporangia of the true Mosses, but are absent in the sexual\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nAs the capsule developes, an external layer of cells--the\r\n_amphithecium_--and an internal mass--the _endothecium_--are\r\ndifferentiated. As a rule the former becomes the wall of the capsule\r\nwhile the latter gives rise to the spores. In this Division, as in\r\nthe Pteridophyta, the name _archesporium_ (Fig. 190 _t_) is given\r\nto the group of cells inside the sporangium which gives rise to\r\nthe mother-cells of the spores. The archesporium is in general a\r\nunicellular layer; in _Sphagnum_ and _Anthoceros_ it is derived from\r\nthe most internal layer of the amphithecium, but with these exceptions\r\nit arises from the endothecium, usually from its most external layer.\r\nIn the true Mosses and in _Riccia_ only spore-mother-cells are produced\r\nfrom the archesporium, but in the majority of the Liverworts some\r\nof these cells are sterile and become elaters (cells with spirally\r\nthickened walls, Figs. 196, 189), or serve as “nurse-cells” for the\r\nspore-mother-cells, which gradually absorb the nutriment which has been\r\naccumulated in them. In _Anthoceros_, and almost all the Leafy-Mosses,\r\na certain mass of cells in the centre of the sporangium (derived\r\nfrom the endothecium) does not take part in the formation of the\r\narchesporium, but forms the so called “column” or “columella” (Figs.\r\n190, 191).\r\n\r\nThe _spores_ arise in _tetrads_, _i.e._ four in each mother-cell, and\r\nare arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, each tetrahedron assuming\r\nthe form of a sphere or a triangular pyramid. The mature spore is a\r\nnucleated mass of protoplasm, with starch or oil as reserve material.\r\nThe wall is divided into two layers: the external coat (exospore) which\r\nis cuticularized and in most cases coloured (brown, yellowish), and the\r\ninternal coat (endospore), which is colourless and not cuticularized.\r\nOn germination the exospore is thrown off, the endospore protrudes, and\r\ncell-division commences and continues with the growth of the protonema\r\n(Fig. 186, _B-D_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 192.--_Andreæa petrophila._ A ripe\r\n  sporogonium: _a_ an archegonium which has been raised with the\r\n  pseudopodium; _p_ the foot; _b_ the neck; _d-e_ the dark-coloured\r\n  portion of the sporangium, whose outer cell-walls are\r\n  considerably thickened; _c_-_c_ the thin-walled portions where\r\n  the dehiscence occurs; _o_ the lower extremity of the spore-sac;\r\n  _f_ calyptra; _g_ the apex of the sporangium. (Mag. 25 times.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 193.--_Andreæa petrophila._ An empty capsule;\r\n  the calyptra has fallen off. (Mag. 25 times.)]\r\n\r\n   The morphological explanation which Celakovsky has given of\r\n   the sporogonium, and which is not at all improbable, is, that\r\n   it is homologous with an embryo consisting of a very small\r\n   stem-portion and a terminal spore-producing leaf. This will be\r\n   further explained in the introduction to the Flowering-plants\r\n   (p. 236).\r\n\r\nIn the Liverworts the young sporogonium lives like a parasite, being\r\nnourished by the sexual generation (only in _Anthoceros_ has it a\r\nslight power of assimilation). In the Leafy-Mosses, on the other\r\nhand, with regard to the power of assimilation, all transitions are\r\nfound from abundant assimilation (_Funaria_, _Physcomitrium_) to\r\nalmost complete “parasitism” (_Sphagnum_, _Andreæa_). In the majority\r\nof the operculate Mosses the sporogonium has a more or less perfect\r\nsystem of assimilation, and is able itself to form a large portion of\r\nthe material necessary for the development of the spores, so that it\r\nchiefly receives from the sexual generation the inorganic substances\r\nwhich must be obtained from the soil. The more highly developed the\r\nassimilative system of the sporogonium, the more stomata are present.\r\n\r\n   APOSPORY. In some operculate Mosses it has been possible to\r\n   obtain a protonema with small Moss-plants from the seta, when\r\n   severed from its Moss-plant, and grown on damp sand.\r\n\r\nThe Mosses are the lowest plants which are provided with stem and\r\nleaf. They are assigned a lower place when compared with the higher\r\nCryptogams, partly because there are still found within the Division\r\nso many forms with a mere thallus, partly because typical roots are\r\nwanting and the anatomical structure is so extremely simple, and partly\r\nalso because of the relation between the two generations. The highest\r\nMosses terminate the Division, the Muscineæ and Pteridophyta having had\r\na common origin in the Algæ-like Thallophyta.\r\n\r\nThey are divided into two classes:--\r\n\r\nHEPATICÆ, or Liverworts.\r\n\r\nMUSCI FRONDOSI. True Mosses or Leafy-Mosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Class 1. =Hepaticæ= (=Liverworts=).\r\n\r\nThe protonema is only slightly developed. The remaining part of the\r\nvegetative body is either a prostrate, often dichotomously-branched\r\nthallus, pressed to the substratum (thalloid Liverworts), with\r\nor without scales on the under side (Figs. 194, 197); or a thin,\r\nprostrate, creeping stem, with distinctly-developed leaves, which are\r\nborne in two or three rows (Figs. 195, 198), viz., two on the upper\r\nand, in most cases, one on the under side. The leaves situated on the\r\nventral side (amphigastria) are differently shaped from the others\r\n(Fig. 198 _a_), and are sometimes entirely absent. In contradistinction\r\nto the Leafy-Mosses, stress must be laid on the _well-marked\r\ndorsiventrality_ of the vegetative organs; _i.e._ the very distinct\r\ncontrast between the dorsal side exposed to the light and the ventral\r\nside turned to the ground. Veins are never found in the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe _ventral part of the archegonium_ (calyptra) continues to grow for\r\nsome time, and encloses the growing embryo, but when the spores are\r\nripe it is finally ruptured by the sporangium, and remains situated\r\nlike a sheath (_vaginula_) around its base. The sporangium opens,\r\nlongitudinally, by _valves_ or _teeth_ (Fig. 194, 195, 197 _b_), very\r\nrarely by a lid, or sometimes not at all. _A columella is wanting_\r\n(except in _Anthoceros_, Fig. 194); but on the other hand, a few of the\r\ncells lying between the spores are developed into _elaters_ (Fig. 196),\r\n_i.e._ spindle-shaped cells with spirally-twisted thickenings, which\r\nare hygroscopic, and thus serve to distribute the spores. (They are\r\nseen in Fig. 189 _C_, not yet fully developed, as long cells radiating\r\nfrom the base of the sporangium. They are wanting in _Riccia_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 194.--_Anthoceros lævis_ (nat. size): _K_-_K_\r\n  capsules.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 195.--_Plagiochila asplenioides_: _a_ unripe,\r\n  and _b_ an open capsule; _p_ involucre. The ventral edge of each\r\n  leaf is higher than its dorsal edge, and covered by the dorsal\r\n  edge of the next one.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 196.--An elater with two spores.]\r\n\r\n   Round the entire archegonium, (or group of archegonia, when\r\n   several are developed on the same receptacle) a sheath--the\r\n   _involucre_--is often formed, which persists, and encloses the\r\n   base of the stalk of the sporangium, together with the sheath\r\n   of the archegonium (Fig. 195 _p_). In the Marchantiaceæ each\r\n   archegonium is enclosed in a loose investment, the perigynium,\r\n   which is developed as an outgrowth from the cells of its stalk.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Liverworts are found in damp and shady places,\r\npressed to the substratum; a few are found floating in fresh water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 1. =Marchantieæ.=\r\n\r\nThis embraces only forms with a thallus, which is more or less\r\ndistinctly dichotomously branched, in some, one or two rows of thin\r\nleaves are situated on its under surface. On the upper surface of the\r\nthallus are found large air-chambers.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Ricciaceæ.= The sporogonia are, with the exception of a few\r\ngenera, situated singly on the surface of the thallus, and consist only\r\nof a capsule without foot or stalk. They always remain enclosed by the\r\nwall of the archegonium (calyptra), and open only by its dissolution.\r\nElaters are not developed. Some genera are found floating like\r\nDuckweed.--_Riccia glauca_ grows on damp clay soil. _R. fluitans_ and\r\n_R. natans_ float in stagnant waters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 197.--_Marchantia polymorpha.

Intermediate forms between the\r\npreceding and the following order. In internal and external structure\r\nmainly resembling the Marchantiaceæ. _Corsinia_; _Boschia_.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Marchantiaceæ=, are large, fleshy forms. The surface of the\r\nthallus is divided into small rhombic areas, in the centre of each of\r\nwhich is found a large, peculiarly constructed stoma (Fig. 197 _A_);\r\nbeneath each of these a large air-cavity is to be found. From the floor\r\nof the air-cavity a number of alga-like cells project into it; these\r\ncontain chlorophyll and are therefore the assimilating cells. The\r\nantheridia and archegonia are each found aggregated on specially formed\r\nbranches (somewhat resembling Mushrooms) projecting from the surface of\r\nthe thallus. The antheridia are developed on the upper surface (Fig.\r\n197 _C_, _D_) and the archegonia on the lower (Fig. 197 _A_, _B_),\r\nnear the centrally-placed stalk.\r\n\r\n_Marchantia polymorpha_ is diœcious (Fig. 197), and very common on damp\r\nplaces. _Lunularia_ (South Europe), frequently found on flower-pots in\r\nconservatories; _Preissia_, _Fegatella_, _Reboulia_, _Targionia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 2. =Anthoceroteæ.=\r\n\r\n   These have an entirely leafless, fleshy, flat, and\r\n   irregularly-shaped thallus. In its intercellular chambers\r\n   Nostoc-colonies are often found, which have forced their way\r\n   through the stomata situated on the under side. The antheridia\r\n   and archegonia arise from the cells lying inside the thallus.\r\n   The capsule resembles a long, thin pod; it has two valves and a\r\n   columella. _Anthoceros_ (_A. lævis_, Fig. 194, and _punctatus_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 3. =Jungermannieæ.=\r\n\r\nSome forms in this family have a thallus in which leaf-like structures\r\nare found (_Blasia_), while in others (_e.g. Metzgeria_, _Pellia_,\r\n_Aneura_) they are entirely absent. The majority, however, have\r\nround, thick stems, bearing dorsally two rows of leaves, and one row\r\nventrally. Some of these have the leaves “underlying” (Fig. 195), while\r\nin others (Fig. 198) they are “overlying.” (See Figs. 195, 198, with\r\nexplanation).\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are spherical, stalked, and situated singly on the apex\r\nof the branches, and open by four valves (in _Sphærocarpus_ they\r\nare indehiscent).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 198.--_Frullania dilatata._ Portion of a\r\n  branch seen from the under side: _r_ and _b_ are the anterior\r\n  and posterior edges of the same dorsal leaf; _a_ ventral leaves\r\n  (amphigastria). The dorsal leaves are “overlying,” _i.e._ the\r\n  anterior edge of the leaf overlaps the posterior edge of the\r\n  preceding one.]\r\n\r\nAll the species in this family were formerly reckoned as belonging to\r\none genus, _Jungermannia_, but now they are divided into several,\r\narranged as follows:--\r\n\r\nI. ANACROGYNÆ. The archegonia are situated on the upper side of the\r\nthallus or stem, _placed laterally_, and covered by an “involucre,”\r\nformed by the calyptra together with the tissue of the stem or thallus.\r\n\r\na. ANELATEREÆ. Without any elaters: _Sphærocarpus_, _Riella_.\r\n\r\nb. ELATEREÆ. α. Thalloid: _Aneura pinguis_, in damp situations;\r\n_Metzgeria furcata_, on trees; _Pellia epiphylla_, in damp situations;\r\n_Blasia pusilla_, on damp clay soil, in the shade (scales are present\r\non the thallus). β. Foliose and not dorsiventral: _Haplomitrium\r\nhookeri_.\r\n\r\nII. ACROGYNÆ. The apex of the stem or of certain branches is adapted\r\nfor the formation of female shoots. The archegonia are most frequently\r\naggregated on the apex of the shoots, and are encircled by their leaves\r\n(perichætium). Between these and the archegonia, enclosing the latter,\r\na peculiar cup-shaped organ (the involucre) is formed. This group only\r\nincludes leaf-bearing genera: _Frullania_, _Radula_, _Madotheca_,\r\n_Ptilidium_, _Calypogeia_, _Lepidozia_, _Mastigobryum_, _Lophocolea_,\r\n_Jungermannia_, _Scapania_, _Plagiochila_.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Class 2. =Musci frondosi or veri (True Mosses).=\r\n\r\nIn this class the protonema is well developed, and resembles a\r\nbranched filamentous Alga, from which it can be easily distinguished\r\nby its oblique septa (in _Sphagnum_ it is a cellular expansion). The\r\nMoss-plant, which is developed directly from the protonema, generally\r\nhas an erect, thick, cylindrical stem similarly constructed on all\r\nsides. The leaves are arranged spirally, the most frequent divergence\r\nbeing 2/5 or 3/8 (Fig. 200 _A_). A midrib is often present and also\r\nmarginal veins formed by longitudinally elongated cells; at these veins\r\nthe leaf is more than one layer in thickness. In _Leucobryum_ the\r\nleaves are generally constructed of more than one layer.\r\n\r\nThe stem grows by means of a three-sided, pyramidal, apical cell which\r\ngives rise to three rows of segments, each segment forming a leaf. The\r\nlateral branches arise from the lower portions of the segments, the\r\nupper portion of which does not take any part in the construction of\r\nthe leaf. From their mode of origin the branches are not axillary, and\r\ndiffer in this respect from the Flowering-plants.\r\n\r\nThe ventral portion of the archegonium is very early ruptured _at its\r\nbase_ by the growing sporogonium, upon which it remains, and it is thus\r\nraised into the air, forming a “hood,” the calyptra (Figs. 192; 200\r\n_B_). In the Sphagnaceæ the hood is not present; in this order, as in\r\nthe Liverworts, the archegonium remains at the base of the sporogonium.\r\nThe sporangium opens by circumsessile dehiscence, the upper portion\r\n(_operculum_) being separated along a specially constructed ring of\r\ncells, and falls off like a “lid” (Fig. 200). Only in a few forms\r\n(families 2 and 3) does any variation of this take place. Elaters are\r\nnever found, but (with the exception of _Archidium_) there is always\r\npresent in the sporangium a central mass of cells, the _columella_,\r\nwhich take no part in the formation of the spores. The columella, in\r\nsome, does not reach quite to the operculum and in these cases the\r\nspore-sac is bell-shaped and covers the columella (_Andreæa_, Fig. 190;\r\n_Sphagnum_, Fig. 199 _D_); but in the majority of Mosses the columella\r\nextends to the lid, so that the space containing the spores becomes a\r\nhollow cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe _sporangium_ is generally raised on a long stalk; in the great\r\nmajority this stalk is formed from the lower half of the oospore and\r\nbelongs to the asexual generation--it is then known as the _seta_. In\r\n_Andreæa_ and _Sphagnum_ the seta is very short, and the sporangia are\r\nraised upon a long stalk (_pseudopodium_) developed from the summit\r\nof the sexual generation (Figs. 190, 192). In the latter figure an\r\narchegonium (_a_) is seen attached to the pseudopodium, having been\r\ncarried up with this during the course of its development. The summit\r\nof the pseudopodium is enlarged to embrace the foot of the sporogonium\r\n(Figs. 192, 199 _D_).\r\n\r\n   A. The sporangium is supported on a pseudopodium; the columella\r\n   does not extend to the operculum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 199.--_Sphagnum acutifolium._--_A_ The\r\n  upper portion of a plant: _a_ branches with antheridia; _ch_\r\n  branches with terminal archegonia and perichætia; _b_ the\r\n  upper stemleaves. _B_ A male branch whose leaves are partly\r\n  taken off in order to show the antheridia. _C_ Group of three\r\n  archegonia: the central one (_a_) is formed from the apical\r\n  cell. _D_ Sporogonium in longitudinal section: the broad foot\r\n  (_sg’_) is sunk in the vaginula, _v_; _c_ calyptra; _ar_ neck\r\n  of the archegonium; _ps_ pseudopodium. _E_ ripe sporangium with\r\n  operculum, and the remains of the archegonium situated on the\r\n  pseudopodium which is still surrounded by the perichætium; to the\r\n  left is a barren branch. _F_ Portion of a foliage-leaf seen from\r\n  above: _l_ perforations; _b_ chlorophyll-containing cells; _s_\r\n  spiral thickenings.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Family 1. =Sphagneæ (Bog-Mosses).=\r\n\r\nThe protonema has been already described. The stem is regularly\r\nbranched owing to the fact that a branch, or collection of branches,\r\narises at every fourth leaf. These branches are closely covered with\r\nleaves, some are erect, while others hang down and surround the stem.\r\nNo rhizoids are developed. These Mosses are of a whitish-green colour,\r\nand when water is present are always saturated with it like a sponge,\r\nthe reason for this being found in the construction of the stem and\r\nleaves. The stems are covered by an external layer of large clear\r\ncells, without chlorophyll, but with annular or spiral thickenings\r\non the walls, which are also perforated by large holes. By means of\r\ncapillary attraction, water is thus raised to the summit of the stem.\r\nSimilarly constructed cells are also found in the leaves, but they\r\nare surrounded by a net of very narrow, chlorophyll-containing cells\r\n(Fig. 199 _F_), whose colour is thus to a great extent lost amongst\r\nthose which are colourless. This anatomical structure is an essential\r\ncondition for the formation of peat. The Bog-Mosses grow by preference\r\non moors, which they cover with a thick carpet saturated with water.\r\nThe lower extremities of the plants perish very rapidly, and gradually\r\nbecome converted into peat, and the branches thus separated from each\r\nother become independent plants. The sporangia (Fig. 199 _D_, _E_) are\r\nspherical, but with a very short stalk. They open by a _lid_, but have\r\nno _annulus_. The _archegonium_ (Fig. 199 _C_) persists at the _base of\r\nthe sporogonium_ as in the Liverworts. Only one genus, _Sphagnum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 2. =Schizocarpeæ.=\r\n\r\n   The Mosses which constitute this family are of a brownish-black\r\n   colour and are found living on rocks. The sporangium resembles\r\n   that of the Liverworts inasmuch as it opens by four valves, but\r\n   these continue attached to each other at the apex as well as at\r\n   the base (Fig. 193).--There is only one genus: _Andreæa_.\r\n\r\n   =B.= The stalk is formed from the lower portion of the\r\n   sporogonium. The columella is continued to the summit of the\r\n   sporangium and united with it (_Archidium_ has no columella.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 3. =Cleistocarpeæ.=\r\n\r\n   The fruit does not dehisce in the regular way, but the spores\r\n   are liberated by decay. They are small Mosses which remain\r\n   in connection with their protonema until the sporangium is\r\n   mature. The archegonium remains sessile at the base of the\r\n   short capsule-stalk, and is not raised into the air (compare\r\n   Hepaticæ).--_Phascum, Ephemerum, Archidium, Pleuridium._\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 4. =Stegocarpeæ.=\r\n\r\nTo this belong the majority of the Mosses, about 3,000 species.\r\n\r\nThe capsule opens as in _Sphagnum_ by means of a _lid_ (_operculum_),\r\nwhich is often prolonged into a beak. Round the mouth of the opened\r\ncapsule, a number of peculiar yellow or red teeth are to be found.\r\nThese constitute the _peristome_; their number is four, or a multiple\r\nof four (8, 16, 32 or 64). The form and thickenings of these teeth are\r\nwidely different, and on this account are used by Systematists for\r\nthe purposes of classification. In some Mosses (Fig. 200 _C_, _D_)\r\nthere is a double row of teeth. Except in _Tetraphis_ they are not\r\nformed from entire cells, but from the strongly thickened portions of\r\nthe wall of certain layers of cells belonging to the lid, and persist\r\nwhen this falls off. They are strongly hygroscopic, and assist greatly\r\nin the ejection of the lid, in which operation they are considerably\r\naided by a ring of elastic cells with thickened walls, situated in the\r\nwall of the lid near the base of the teeth. This ring is known as the\r\n_annulus_. The archegonium is raised into the air like a hood, the\r\ncalyptra, which either covers the sporangium on all sides (having the\r\nshape of a bell), or is split on one side (Fig. 200 _B_, _h_).\r\n\r\n   Among peculiar forms may be mentioned: _Splachnum_, which is\r\n   especially remarkable for the collar-like expansion at the base\r\n   of the capsule. _Fissidens_ deviates in having a flat stem and\r\n   leaves arranged in two rows. The leaves are boat-shaped and\r\n   half embrace the stem.--_Schistostega_ has two kinds of stems.\r\n   The barren ones resemble Fern-leaves; they have two rows of\r\n   leaves, which are attached together vertically, are decurrent\r\n   and coalesce at their bases. The fertile ones have an ordinary\r\n   appearance.--_Tetraphis_: the peristome is composed of four\r\n   teeth, which are formed from entire cells. _T. pellucida_ has\r\n   peculiar gemmæ.\r\n\r\nThe family is divided into two groups: the Musci acrocarpi, the growth\r\nof whose main axis is limited and terminated by the formation of the\r\nsexual organs; and the Musci pleurocarpi, whose sporogonia are situated\r\non special lateral shoots, while the growth of the main axis is\r\nunlimited.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 200.--_A Hypnum populeum_. _B_ and _C_\r\n  Sporangia, with hood (_h_), and operculum (_l’_), and without\r\n  these (_C_), showing the peristome (_p_). _D_ The mouth of the\r\n  capsule of _Fontinalis antipyretica_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A. =Acrocarpi.=\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Weisiaceæ.= Peristome, with 16 teeth arranged in\r\n   one series, rarely wanting.

Many are found in great\r\n   numbers, and growing thickly massed together, they form an\r\n   important feature in landscapes (for example _Sphagnum_ and\r\n   _Polytrichum_ in the Arctic Tundra). In the Northern and\r\n   Arctic regions the Mosses are very plentiful, and often form a\r\n   considerable part of the vegetation, while in the Tropics they\r\n   are insignificant.\r\n\r\n   Species of _Hypnum_ and _Polytrichum_, like _Sphagnum_, play an\r\n   important part in the formation of peat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DIVISION III.\r\n\r\n                  PTERIDOPHYTA (VASCULAR CRYPTOGAMS).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alternation of generations is as distinct in this Division as in\r\nthe Mosses, but the sexual generation consists of only a small thallus,\r\nthe prothallium, which bears directly the sexual organs, _antheridia_\r\nand _archegonia_; and the asexual generation, which arises from the\r\nfertilisation of the oosphere, is no longer a single short-lived\r\nsporangium, but a highly developed, generally perennial, plant provided\r\nwith stem, leaves and _true roots_ (Ferns, Horsetails, etc.), the\r\nsporangia being borne on the leaves. In this latter generation the\r\ntissues are differentiated into epidermis, ground tissue and vascular\r\ntissue; in the last named the bundles are closed, and in the majority\r\nof cases concentric.\r\n\r\nThe =sexual generation=, =gametophyte=, or =prothallium=, is _always\r\na thallus_, although not always green and leaf-like (Figs. 205, 215,\r\n222, 229, 235, etc.) It is very small, even in cases where it attains\r\nthe greatest development, and consists only of parenchymatous cells.\r\nThe prothallium is nourished by hair-like roots (rhizoids) and has\r\nonly a transitory existence, dying soon after the fertilisation of its\r\noosphere.\r\n\r\nThe ANTHERIDIA exhibit great variations in structure which, however,\r\nmust be considered as modifications of the fundamental type which is\r\nfound in the Mosses. These modifications will be mentioned under the\r\nvarious families. The _spermatozoids_ are always spirally-coiled,\r\nself-motile, protoplasmic bodies, with most frequently a large number\r\nof fine cilia on the anterior end (Figs. 206, 223, 234). They are\r\nformed principally from the nucleus of the mother-cell, and portions of\r\nthe cytoplasm often remain for a time attached to their posterior end.\r\n\r\nThe ARCHEGONIA are more uniform throughout the entire Division,\r\nand more closely resemble those of the Mosses. They are, as in the\r\nprevious Division, principally flask-shaped; but the central portion,\r\nwhich encloses the oosphere, is always embedded in the tissue of the\r\nprothallium, so that the neck, which is formed of 4 rows of cells,\r\nprojects above the surface (Figs. 201 ^3, 222 _h_). The development\r\nof the archegonium in a Fern is seen in the accompanying figure (Fig.\r\n201). The archegonium is developed from a surface cell, which divides\r\ninto three cells by two walls in a direction parallel to the surface\r\nof the prothallium (Fig. 201). The most internal cell becomes the\r\nventral portion of the archegonium. The external one (_b_) divides\r\nperpendicularly to the surface of the prothallium into four cells,\r\nwhich again divide parallel to the surface and form the neck (_b_,\r\nin 2 and 3). The intermediate cell projects upwards into the neck\r\nand divides into two, the lower one, after the separation of the\r\nventral canal-cell, becoming the _oosphere_, and the upper one the\r\n_neck-canal-cell_ (_c_, in 2 and 3).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 201.--_Pteris serrulata._ Development of\r\n  archegonia.]\r\n\r\nAs in the Mosses, the divisional walls of the neck-canal-cells become\r\nmucilaginous, causing the rupture of the neck of the archegonium.\r\nFertilisation takes place as in the Mosses, and the passage of the\r\nspermatozoids, along the neck, to the oosphere, has been observed.\r\nWater (rain or dew) is similarly necessary for the movements of the\r\nspermatozoids, and hence for fertilisation. The other classes of the\r\nDivision chiefly deviate from the Ferns in having the archegonium sunk\r\ndeeper into the prothallium, and the neck reduced in length (compare\r\nFig. 201 with Figs. 216, 222, 235, 236).\r\n\r\nAccording to the nature of the spores, the three classes of the\r\nVascular Cryptogams are each divided into isosporous and heterosporous\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nI. The =isosporous= Vascular Cryptogams have _only one kind of spore_.\r\nThe prothallium developed from this is in some cases monœcious, bearing\r\nboth antheridia and archegonia; but in others there is a distinct\r\ntendency for each prothallium to bear only antheridia or archegonia\r\n(diœcious)--true Ferns and _Lycopodium_.\r\n\r\nIn _Equisetum_ there is only one kind of spore, but two kinds of\r\nprothallia are developed, one of which bears only antheridia (male),\r\nthe other only archegonia (female); but the one that bears antheridia\r\nmay be transformed into the one that bears archegonia and vice versa.\r\n\r\nII. In the higher group, =heterosporous= Vascular Cryptogams\r\n(_Selaginella_ and _Isoëtes_, etc.), there are two distinct kinds\r\nof spores, the _small_, microspores, and the _large_, macrospores.\r\nThe _microspores_ are male, and produce prothallia which bear only\r\nantheridia. The _macrospores_ are female, and produce prothallia which\r\nbear only archegonia.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to this difference in the spores, there is also found\r\na difference in the development of the prothallium. In the Isosporeæ\r\nthe prothallium is large, and either green, leaf-like, and provided\r\nwith rhizoids (most of the Ferns, Horsetails, etc.), or subterranean,\r\npale-coloured, and globular (_Ophioglossum_, _Lycopodium_). It lives\r\nvegetatively for a fairly long time, and generally produces a large\r\nand varying number of archegonia and antheridia. The prothallium in\r\nthe Heterosporeæ is gradually more and more reduced, its independent\r\nand vegetative life becomes of less and less importance, it becomes\r\nmore dependent on the mother-plant, and projects from the spore very\r\nslightly, or not at all. The antheridia and archegonia become reduced\r\nin number to one, and also degenerate in point of development.\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that the gradual development of the asexual\r\ngeneration, the development of the two kinds of spores, and the\r\nprogressive reduction of the prothallium and sexual organs which\r\nis found in this Division, is continued to the Gymnosperms and\r\nAngiosperms. The microspores are in these called pollen-grains, and\r\nthe male prothallium is very rudimentary. The macrospores are termed\r\nembryo-sacs, and the female prothallium, the endosperm.\r\n\r\nThe =asexual generation=, =sporophyte=. When the oosphere, which in\r\nthis case as in all others is a primordial cell, is fertilised, it\r\nsurrounds itself with a cell-wall and commences to divide into a number\r\nof cells, to form the embryo.\r\n\r\n   The first dividing wall (basal wall) is nearly horizontal, and\r\n   in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the archegonium.\r\n   The next wall is vertical, and the next perpendicular to the\r\n   other two. The oosphere, therefore, is now divided into eight\r\n   octants by these three walls. The basal wall divides the\r\n   embryo into a hypobasal and an epibasal half. From the first\r\n   one, by continued divisions, the first root is developed; from\r\n   the latter, the stem and leaves. After the formation of the\r\n   octants the development proceeds in somewhat different ways in\r\n   the various classes. In addition to the stem, leaf, and root,\r\n   a “foot” is developed from the hypobasal half which remains\r\n   enclosed in the prothallium, and conveys nourishment from the\r\n   prothallium to the young plant until it is able to sustain\r\n   itself (Fig. 202). The formation of these members in the embryo\r\n   depends on the position of the oosphere in the archegonium and\r\n   prothallium, and is independent of gravity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 202.--_Adiantum capillus veneris._ Vertical\r\n  section through a prothallium (_f f_), with a young plant\r\n  attached on its under side (mag. about 10 times); _r_ the first\r\n  root, and _b_ the first leaf of the young Fern-plant; _m_ the\r\n  foot. In the angle between _m_ and _b_ lies the apex of the\r\n  stem: _h_ the rhizoids of the prothallium; _æ æ_ unfertilised\r\n  archegonia.]\r\n\r\nIn the Mosses the asexual generation is the sporogonium, which is\r\nlimited in its development and in a great measure dependent upon the\r\nsexual generation, upon which it is situated; but in the Pteridophyta\r\nthis generation is an independent and highly developed plant,\r\nprovided with stem, leaf, and true roots, and has in many instances\r\nan unlimited development. The Pteridophyta are the lowest Division\r\nwith _true roots_. The root which is first formed is very similar in\r\nnature to the primary root of the Monocotyledons; it very soon dies\r\nand is replaced by others which are more permanent, and developed\r\nupon the stem (adventitious roots); roots are wanting in _Salvinia_,\r\n_Psilotum_, and some Hymenophyllaceæ. The differentiation is, however,\r\nnot so complete as in the Flowering-plants, and so many leafy forms are\r\nnot found. The various members of these plants are anatomically much\r\nhigher than in the Mosses, having an epidermis, a ground tissue with\r\nvariously differentiated cells, and a highly developed vascular system.\r\nThe vascular bundles, like those in the Monocotyledons, are without\r\ncambium, and closed; they are therefore incapable of any increase in\r\nthickness. In general the bundles are concentric, with the bast round\r\nthe wood (Fig. 203). The wood is almost entirely made up of scalariform\r\ntracheides.\r\n\r\n   In _Isoëtes_ a secondary thickening takes place by a cambium,\r\n   which is formed inside the cortex, constructing secondary\r\n   cortex to the exterior, and secondary wood towards the\r\n   interior.--_Botrychium_ has also a thickening growth. Collateral\r\n   vascular bundles occur in _Osmundaceæ_, _Equisetaceæ_, and the\r\n   leaves of many _Polypodiaceæ_, etc.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 203.--Portion of the stem of a Fern. Above is\r\n  seen the transverse section, with vascular bundles of different\r\n  form and size. The rhombic figures on the side of the stem are\r\n  leaf-scars.]\r\n\r\nIt is a point of special interest, that the gigantic forms of Ferns,\r\nEquisetums, and Club-Mosses (which flourished in earlier geological\r\nperiods, when these classes attained their highest development)\r\npossessed some means of increasing in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe _sporangia_ are in all cases _capsule-like_, and burst open when\r\nripe to eject the spores. They are nearly always situated on the leaves\r\n(in _Lycopodiaceæ_, in the axils of the leaves, or above these, on the\r\nstems themselves). In some forms (LEPTOSPORANGIATÆ), the sporangia are\r\ndeveloped from a single epidermal cell; in others (EUSPORANGIATÆ),\r\nfrom a group of epidermal cells, or from cells which lie beneath the\r\nepidermis. In the first group a primitive mother-cell (archesporium)\r\nis formed, which divides commonly into sixteen special mother-cells.\r\nIn the latter group, on the other hand, a number of primitive\r\nspore-mother-cells are developed. In each sporangium three different\r\ntissues are generally developed; an innermost _sporogenous_ one (_s_ in\r\nFig. 204 _A_), which arises from the archesporangium; an outermost one,\r\nwhich forms the _wall_ (_a_), and may be one or, more rarely, several\r\nlayers in thickness; and an intermediate one, the _tapetum_ (Fig. 204\r\n_A_, _B_, _b t_), which is rich in protoplasm, and whose cells are\r\ndissolved so that the spores float freely in the fluid thus provided.\r\nThe spores arise as in the Mosses (in tetrads), by the cross-division\r\nof the special mother-cells, and according to the manner in which they\r\nare arranged in the mother-cell have either a tetrahedral form, with\r\na large base resembling a segment of a ball, or are oblong (bilateral\r\nspores). Their construction is the same as in the Mosses (p. 187).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 204.--_Selaginella inæqualifolia. A_ A\r\n  young sporangium, which may develope either into a macro-, or a\r\n  microsporangium. _B_ A microsporangium.]\r\n\r\nThe spore-formation in its earliest commencement takes place in the\r\nsame way in the Isosporous and the Heterosporous Vascular Cryptogams;\r\nbut from a certain point, after the tetrahedral division, a difference\r\noccurs with regard to the macrosporangia. All the spores formed in the\r\nmicrosporangium may complete their development; but those which are\r\nformed in the macrosporangium are generally aborted, with the exception\r\nof one or four, and these consequently attain a much larger size (see\r\nFig. 239.--The series to the left are microsporangia; those to the\r\nright, macrosporangia).\r\n\r\n   APOGAMY. In some Ferns (_Pteris cretica_; _Aspidium filix mas_,\r\n   var. _cristatum_; _A. falcatum_; _Todea africana_) the young\r\n   plant is not developed as a consequence of fertilisation, but as\r\n   a bud from the prothallium. This is known as apogamy, or loss of\r\n   the power of sexual reproduction. The antheridia are generally\r\n   more or less developed; archegonia are entirely wanting in _Asp.\r\n   filix mas_, var. _cristatum_. This variety has probably only\r\n   become apogamous through cultivation. Many specimens of _Isoëtes\r\n   lacustris_, in a lake in the Vosges mountains, produce in the\r\n   place where the sporangia are usually found, a vegetative shoot\r\n   which grows into a new plant, so that the sexual generation is\r\n   wanting in this case. Some specimens have sporangia on some\r\n   leaves, and shoots on others.\r\n\r\n   Apospory, or the formation of prothallia instead of sporangia\r\n   and spores on the leaves, is found in _Athyrium filix\r\n   femina_, var. _clarissimum_. In this case the development\r\n   of the sporangia proceeds only to a certain point, and from\r\n   these arrested sporangia the prothallia are produced. Normal\r\n   sporangia are entirely wanting in this variety, and in _Aspidium\r\n   angulare_, var. _pulcherrimum_, sporangia are completely\r\n   wanting. Compare the Mosses (page 188).\r\n\r\nThe Vascular Cryptogams are divided into _three large classes_,\r\nin each of which a progressive development can be traced from the\r\nisosporous to the heterosporous forms, but some of these are now only\r\nknown as fossils.\r\n\r\nClass 1. =Filicinæ= (=Ferns=).--The stem is small in comparison with\r\nthe leaves, and branches only seldom, and then by lateral shoots. The\r\nleaves are scattered, large, often deeply divided, and of various\r\nhighly developed forms. The undeveloped leaves are rolled up in the\r\nbud, having what is termed circinate venation. The sporangia are\r\nsituated on the edge or on the lower side of the leaves, those on\r\nwhich the sporangia are borne (_sporophylls_) being often the ordinary\r\nfoliage-leaves; but in a few cases the fertile differ from the barren\r\nones (a higher stage in development). The fertile leaves are not\r\nconfined to definite parts of the shoot, and do not limit its growth.\r\nThe archesporium is most frequently unicellular.\r\n\r\n_A_. =Isosporous=: Sub-Class 1. Filices (True Ferns).\r\n\r\n_B_. =Heterosporous=: Sub-Class 2. Hydropterideæ (Water Ferns).\r\n\r\nClass 2. =Equisetinæ= (=Horsetails=), in its widest meaning.--The\r\nleaves in this class are small in comparison with the stem. They are\r\narranged in whorls, and unite to form a sheath. The sporangia are\r\nsituated on specially modified, shield-like leaves, which are closely\r\npacked together and form a “cone.” The cone is borne terminally, and\r\nlimits the growth of the shoot. The sporangia are developed from a\r\nlarge group of epidermal cells, the archesporium being unicellular. The\r\nbranches are arranged in whorls, and develope acropetally.\r\n\r\n_A_. =Isosporous=: Sub-Class 1. Equisetaceæ. Existing forms.\r\n\r\n_B_. =Heterosporous=: Sub-Class 2. Extinct forms.\r\n\r\nClass 3. =Lycopodinæ= (=Club-Mosses=).--Roots generally branching\r\ndichotomously. The leaves are scattered or opposite, and in proportion\r\nto the stem very small, undivided, and simple. They are scale-like and\r\ntriangular, tapering from a broad base to a point. The sporangia are\r\nsituated singly (except in _Psilotaceæ_), and almost in every case on\r\nthe upper side of the leaf or in the axil of a leaf; but in some cases\r\nthey are borne on the stem, just above the leaf-axil. The sporangia\r\narise from groups of epidermal cells. The sporophylls are often\r\nmodified, and differ from the foliage-leaves; they are then arranged in\r\ncones placed terminally on branches, thus limiting their growth.\r\n\r\n_A_. =Isosporous=: Sub-Class 1. Lycopodieæ.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Heterosporous=: Sub-Class 2. Selaginelleæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Class 1. =Filicinæ= (=Ferns=).\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this class have already been given on page 204.\r\n\r\nThe class is divided into two sub-classes:--\r\n\r\n1. The TRUE FERNS, FILICES, have one kind of spore which generally\r\ndevelopes monœcious prothallia, relatively large and green. The\r\nsporangia are most frequently situated in groups (_sori_), which are\r\noften covered but not enclosed by an _indusium_.\r\n\r\n2. WATER FERNS, HYDROPTERIDÆ, have microsporangia with many (4 × 16)\r\nmicrospores, and _macrosporangia, each with one macrospore_. The\r\nprothallium is small, and projects but slightly from the germinating\r\nspore. The sporangia are situated in groups (_sori_), which are either\r\nenclosed by an indusium, or enveloped in a portion of a leaf, to form\r\n“fruits” termed _sporocarps_.\r\n\r\n   The old name for the Hydropterideæ, “Rhizocarpeæ,” _i.e._ the\r\n   “root-fruited,” originated from the erroneous supposition that\r\n   the sporocarps were borne on the roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Sub-Class 1. =Filices= (=the True Ferns=).\r\n\r\nOf the eight orders (with about 4,000 species) comprised in this\r\nsub-class, the Polypodiaceæ is the largest (having about 2,800 species)\r\nand the most familiar; for this reason it will be taken as typical.\r\n\r\n=The sexual generation.= When the spore germinates, the external\r\ncovering (exospore) is ruptured, as in the Mosses. The internal\r\ncell-wall (endospore) grows out as a filament, which soon divides and\r\ngives rise to the prothallium, a flat, cellular expansion resembling\r\nthe thallus of a Liverwort. In its fully developed state the\r\nprothallium is generally heart-shaped, dark green, and provided with\r\nroot-hairs, and it attains a diameter of about one centimetre (Fig.\r\n205). It is formed of one layer of cells, except along the central\r\nline near the anterior depression, where it becomes several layers\r\nof cells in thickness, forming the “cushion,” on the lower side of\r\nwhich the archegonia are developed. The antheridia are first formed;\r\nthey are thus found on the oldest parts of the prothallium, on its\r\nedge, or among the root-hairs. The archegonia are developed later,\r\nand are therefore found near the apex. Several tropical Ferns have\r\nprothallia[18] deviating from this typical form; _Trichomanes_\r\n(Order _Hymenophyllaceæ_) has filamentous, branched prothallia,\r\nwhich resemble the protonema of a Moss. Others, again, have\r\nstrap-shaped prothallia, which resemble the thallus of certain\r\nLiverworts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 205.--Prothallium (_p p_) of Maiden hair\r\n  (_Adiantum capillus veneris_) with a young plant attached: _b_\r\n  first leaf; _w′_ primary root; _w″_ adventitious roots; _h h_\r\n  root-hairs of the prothallium (× abt. 30).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 206.--Antheridia of Maiden-hair (× 550).\r\n  _A_ Unripe; _B_ ripe, but unopened; _C_ open and ejecting the\r\n  spermatozoids (_s_). Those which have been last ejected are still\r\n  lying enclosed in their mother-cells, the others are coiled up\r\n  and drag with them the cytoplasmic remains (_b_); _f_ cells of\r\n  the prothallium.]\r\n\r\nThe ARCHEGONIA have been already mentioned (p. 199, Fig. 201). The\r\nANTHERIDIA are hemispherical or slightly conical bodies (Fig. 206).\r\nThey consist, as in the Mosses, of a wall formed by one layer of\r\ncells, which encloses a number of spermatozoid-mother-cells (_A_\r\nand _B_). The antheridia when ripe absorb water, and are ruptured,\r\nand the spirally-coiled spermatozoids liberated (Fig. 206 _S_).\r\nThe spermatozoids have been observed to pass down the neck of the\r\narchegonium, and to fuse with the oosphere.\r\n\r\n=The asexual generation.= The first leaf, the “cotyledon,” of the\r\nembryo developed from the oospore (Figs. 202, 205) is always small,\r\nand has a very simple shape. The leaves which occur later become more\r\nperfect, stage by stage, until the permanent form of leaf has been\r\nattained.--The STEM is most frequently a subterranean or a semi-aerial\r\nrhizome; it is only in the tropical, palm-like Tree-Ferns, that the\r\nstem raises itself high in the air and resembles that of a tree,\r\nwith leaf-scars or with the remains of leaves attached (Figs. 207,\r\n203); in certain species the stem is encased in a thick mat of aerial\r\nroots (_Dicksonia antarctica_). When the rhizome is horizontal the\r\ninternodes are frequently elongated, and the leaves are arranged in two\r\nrows, as in _Polypodium vulgare_ and in the Bracken-Fern (_Pteridium\r\naquilinum_), etc.; it is also generally _dorsiventral_, having a dorsal\r\nside on which the leaves are situated, and a ventral side, different\r\nfrom the former, on which the roots are borne. When the stem ascends\r\nin an oblique direction, or is nearly vertical, its internodes are\r\nextremely short, and the leaves are arranged in a spiral line with a\r\ncomplicated phyllotaxis, _e.g._ in _Athyrium filix-fœmina_, _Aspidium\r\nfilix-mas_, etc. The BRANCHING upon the whole is extremely slight, and\r\nis generally confined to the petiole (_e.g. Aspid. filix-mas_), or\r\nto the stem near the insertion of the leaves. Several species normally\r\nform buds on different parts of the lamina. The buds which are formed\r\non the stem are not confined to the leaf-axil as in the higher plants.\r\nThe Tree-Ferns, generally, do not branch at all.\r\n\r\nThe VASCULAR BUNDLES are _concentric_, with the wood surrounded by\r\nthe soft bast. In transverse section they are seen as circles or\r\nirregularly-shaped figures (Fig. 203), the name of “King Charles and\r\nthe Oak” (Bracken-Fern) having originated from the appearance which the\r\nbundles present in oblique section. In _Osmunda_ they are collateral\r\nand resemble those of the Flowering-plants. Round each individual\r\nbundle is often a sheath of thick-walled, hard, brown, sclerenchymatous\r\ncells, which act as a mechanical tissue; similar strands are also found\r\nin other parts of the stem.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 207.--Various Ferns (1, 2, 3, 4).]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES in nearly all species are only foliage-leaves, borne in a\r\nspiral. They have an apical growth which continues for a long time,\r\nand some require several years for their complete development. In the\r\nbuds they are rolled up (_circinate_); not only the midrib, but also\r\nall the lateral veins, and even the terminal portions of a leaf are\r\nsometimes rolled up together, the tissues of the leaf being already\r\nfully developed and only waiting to expand. The leaves are often\r\nexcessively divided and compound, with pinnate branches, and have\r\nan epidermis with stomata and a well-developed system of venation.\r\nStipules are only found in _Marattiaceæ_ and _Ophioglossaceæ_.\r\n\r\nVery often peculiar hairs or scales (_paleæ_, _ramenta_), dry, brown,\r\nflat and broad, are found on stem and leaf.\r\n\r\nThe SPORANGIA are small, round capsules, which, in a very large number\r\nof Ferns, are formed on the back, but more rarely on the edge of the\r\nordinary foliage-leaves. It is very seldom that there is any difference\r\nin form between the barren foliage-leaves and the fertile leaves, as is\r\nfound for example in _Blechnum spicant_ or _Struthiopteris_; or that\r\nthe fertile part of the leaf is differently constructed from the barren\r\nportion of the same leaf, as in the Royal-Fern (_Osmunda_). In such\r\ninstances the mesophyll of the fertile parts is poorly developed.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia in the _Polypodiaceæ_ are lens-shaped, with long stalk\r\n(Fig. 211 _D_): their wall consists of one cell-layer on which a single\r\nrow of cells, passing vertically over the top (that is along the edge\r\nof the sporangium), is developed into the “ring” (annulus). The cells\r\nof the annulus are very much thickened on the inner and side walls,\r\nand are yellowish-brown. The thickened cells, however, do not entirely\r\nencircle the sporangium, and on one side, near the stalk, they pass\r\nover into large, flat, thin-walled cells. These form a weak point in\r\nthe wall, and it is here that the sporangium is opened diagonally by\r\nthe elongation of the annulus. The sporangium of the Polypodiaceæ\r\nopens as it dries. The cells of the annulus are very hygroscopic, and\r\nin straightening, the annulus bends back with a jerk, thus ejecting\r\nthe spores to considerable distances. The cells of the annulus absorb\r\nwater with great readiness. [The sporangium arises as a single\r\nepidermal cell, from which a basal stalk-cell is cut off. Three oblique\r\ncell-walls, intersecting near the base, are next formed in the upper\r\ncell, and a fourth between these and parallel to the free surface; an\r\ninner tetrahedral cell enclosed by four others is thus formed, the\r\nouter cells become the wall of the sporangium, while the inner cell,\r\nby a series of walls, parallel to its sides, cuts off a layer of\r\ncells which eventually form the tapetum, the remaining central cell\r\nconstituting the archesporium.]\r\n\r\nThe SPORES are either oblong and bilateral, or they are tetrahedric\r\nwith curved sides, depending upon the way in which the tetrad division\r\nhas taken place.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are almost always situated on the nerves and gathered\r\ninto groups, _sori_, which differ in form in the various genera. The\r\nsori, in many genera, may be covered by a scale-like structure, the\r\n_indusium_ (Figs. 211 _B_, 212).\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, each sorus is situated on a small papilla\r\n(_placenta_, or _receptacle_), which is supplied by a small vascular\r\nbundle. Between the sporangia, hairs (_paraphyses_) are often situated,\r\nwhich spring either from the placenta or from the stalks of the\r\nsporangia.\r\n\r\n=Systematic Division.= The Ferns may be divided into two groups,\r\ncharacterized by the structure and development of the sporangia.\r\nThe sporangia in the EUSPORANGIATÆ take their origin from a group\r\nof epidermal cells, and their walls are formed by several layers of\r\ncells. The archesporium is the (not tetrahedric) hypodermal terminal\r\ncell of the axial row of cells which give rise to the sporangium.\r\nIn the LEPTOSPORANGIATÆ the sporangia are developed from single\r\nepidermal cells, and their walls are uni-layered. The archesporium is a\r\ncentral, often tetrahedric cell, from which sixteen spore-mother-cells\r\nare developed.[19] It is difficult to say which form is the oldest\r\n(according to Prantl, those which have the sori on the nerve-endings);\r\nhowever, the Eusporangiatæ would seem to have made their appearance\r\nlong before the others, and also well defined Marattiaceæ and\r\nOphioglossaceæ occur in the Kulm and Coal period, before the true\r\nPolypodiaceæ.\r\n\r\nAbout 4,000 species of Ferns are now existing, and they are found\r\nespecially in tropical and sub-tropical forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 1. =Eusporangiatæ.=\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Ophioglossaceæ.= The prothallium differs from that of all\r\nother Ferns in being _subterranean_, _free from chlorophyll_, _pale_\r\nand _tuberous_. The stem is extremely short, with short internodes,\r\nmost frequently unbranched, vertical, and entirely buried in the ground\r\n(Fig. 208 _st_). In several species (among which are the native ones)\r\none leaf is produced every year, which has taken three to four years\r\nfor its development. In _Botrychium_ a closed, sheath-like basal part\r\nof each leaf covers the subsequent leaves during their development. In\r\n_Ophioglossum_ and others each leaf has at its base an intrapetiolar,\r\ncap-like sheath, which protects the succeeding leaf. The leaves are\r\nof two kinds: (_a_) foliage, which in _Ophioglossum vulgatum_ are\r\nlanceolate and entire, but in _Botrychium_ however, are pinnate (_b_\r\nin Fig. 208 _A_, _B_); and (_b_) fertile, which are found facing the\r\nupper side of the foliage-leaves. These latter in _Ophioglossum_ are\r\nundivided and spike-like (Fig. 209 _A_), but pinnate in _Botrychium_\r\n(Fig. 208 _B_). Each foliage and fertile leaf are branches from the\r\nsame petiole. The large sporangia are placed laterally, and open by\r\ntwo valves. No annulus is formed (Fig. 209).--_Ophioglossum_ reproduces\r\nvegetatively by adventitious buds on the roots.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 208.--_A Ophioglossum vulgatum_\r\n  (Adder’s-tongue); _B Botrychium lunaria_ (Moonwort), both\r\n  natural size; _r-r_ roots; _bs_ leaf-stalk; _st_ stem; _b_\r\n  foliage-leaf; _f_ fertile leaf.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 209.--Fertile leaf of _Ophioglossum_.]\r\n\r\nThree genera with about twelve species.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Marattiaceæ= are tropical Ferns, whose gigantic leaves\r\nresemble those of the Polypodiaceæ, but have stipules in addition.\r\nThe sporangia are grouped in sori, situated on the lower side of the\r\nleaves, the sporangia in each sorus being arranged either in two rows\r\nor in a ring. In _Angiopteris_ they are isolated (Fig. 210 _A_),\r\nbut in the other species (_Kaulfussia_, _Danæa_, _Marattia_), they\r\nare united, and form “synangia” divided into a number of chambers\r\ncorresponding to the sporangia. These open by clefts or pores.\r\n_Marattia_ presents the highest development, as its sporangia are\r\ncompletely united in a capsule-like synangium, which is closed until\r\nmaturity, and then opens by two valves. In each valve there is a row\r\nof three to eleven sporangia, each opening by a slit towards the\r\ninside (Fig. 210 _B_, _C_). An indusium encloses the sorus, except in\r\n_Kaulfussia_; it is formed of flat and lobed hairs, which resemble\r\nthe hairs of the other portions of the leaves. In _Angiopteris_ and\r\n_Marattia_ the indusium is very rudimentary; in _Danæa_ it forms a kind\r\nof cupule.\r\n\r\n   The numerous fossil Marattiaceæ (15 genera, with 98 species)\r\n   present similar differences to those now living, but more\r\n   various forms are found, for example, with solitary free\r\n   sporangia. Those now living are the last small remnant (4 genera\r\n   with only 23 species) of a once dominant family, which existed\r\n   from very early times, and whose culminating point was reached\r\n   in the Kulm and Coal periods.\r\n\r\n   The Ophioglossaceæ appear also in the Kulm and Coal periods,\r\n   and were about as numerous as at the present time (presumably 2\r\n   genera, with 19 species). Leptosporangiate Ferns appear however\r\n   to have occurred first of all in the Trias-formation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 210.--Sporangia of the Marattiaceæ: _A_\r\n  _Angiopteris_; _B_ and _C Marattia_; _C_ is a half sorus with\r\n  nine sporangia, each of which has opened by a longitudinal cleft.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Family 2. =Leptosporangiatæ.=\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Polypodiaceæ.= Sporangia on the lower side of the leaves,\r\n_stalked_ and provided with a _vertical_, incomplete annulus; dehiscing\r\nby a transverse cleft (Fig. 211 _D_).--The genera are distinguished by\r\nthe form of the indusium and the position of the sori, etc.\r\n\r\n1. The sporangia cover the entire lower surface of the leaf (Tropical\r\nAmerica and Asia). _Acrostichum_, _Platycerium._\r\n\r\n2. Sori without indusia, circular or oval. _Polypodium_ (Fig. 211 _A_).\r\nThe leaves are most frequently situated in two rows on the dorsal\r\nside of the creeping rhizome, and fall off leaving a smooth scar\r\nbehind.--_P. vulgare_, common in woods, on stones. (_Phegopteris_ also\r\nhas no indusium; see page 214).\r\n\r\n3. The sporangia are situated in continuous lines just inside the\r\nmargin of the leaf.--_Pteris_[20]: the sporangia form a continuous\r\nline along the entire margin of the leaf (Fig. 211 _C_), which bends\r\nover and covers the sporangia, forming a “false-indusium.” _Pteridium_\r\nhas linear sori situated on a marginal vascular bundle, covered by two\r\nlinear basal indusia, of which the outer is bent over like the edge of\r\na leaf.--_P. aquilinum_ (Bracken) has a wide-spreading rhizome with\r\nlarge alternate leaves, placed on opposite sides, at some distance\r\napart. Only one leaf is developed from each branch every year.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 211.--Portions of leaves with sori. _A_\r\n  _Polypodium_. _B Aspidium_. _C Pteridium_. _D_ A sporangium\r\n  of one of the Polypodiaceæ: _r_ the annulus; _s_ spores.]\r\n\r\n   _Adiantum_ (Maiden-hair): sori on the underside of small\r\n   portions of the edge of the leaf, which are bent over (false\r\n   indusium). _Cryptogramme_ (_Allosorus_), _Cheilanthes_.\r\n\r\n4. The sori are oval or linear, situated on one side of the vascular\r\nbundle.--_Asplenium_ (Fig. 212 _A_): sori linear; indusium with one of\r\nits edges attached at the external side. _A. ruta muraria_ (Wall-Rue);\r\n_A. septentrionale_; _A. trichomanes_.--_Athyrium_: sori linear or\r\ncurved; _A. filix-fœmina_ (Lady-Fern).--_Scolopendrium_ (Fig. 212 _B_):\r\nsori as in _Asplenium_, but situated in pairs across the lanceolate,\r\nentire leaves.

Sori circular and covered by a shield-like, or reniform\r\nindusium.--_Aspidium_ (Fig. 211 _B_); the leaves wither away and\r\nleave no scar upon the root-stock. _A. filix-mas_ (Male-Fern); _A.\r\nspinulosum_.--_Phegopteris_ has no indusium, the withered bases of the\r\nleaf-stalks are persistent; _P. dryopteris_ and _P. polypodioides_.\r\n\r\n6. The indusium is situated below the sori, and has the shape of a\r\none-sided scale (_Cystopteris_, _Struthiopteris_), or of a cup or\r\ncupule, which in _Woodsia_ is sometimes fimbriate (Fig. 212 _C_, _D_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 212.--_A Asplenium_.\r\n  _B Scolopendrium_. _C Woodsia_; _D_\r\n  single sorus of the same. _E Cyathea_: the sporangia\r\n  have fallen off in the upper sori.

Europe.\r\n\r\nThis order is the greatest, comprising about 2,800 species, the\r\nmajority being perennial plants. A few are large, and known as\r\nTree-Ferns.\r\n\r\n   As plants in conservatories and rooms the following are\r\n   cultivated: species of _Gymnogramme_ (tropical America),\r\n   _Lomaria_, _Nephrolepis_, _Pteris_ (_P. serrulata_, _cretica_).\r\n\r\n   Officinal. _Aspidium filix-mas_, rhizome and the withered\r\n   petioles.--Species of _Alsophila_ and _Cibotium_ give Penghawar\r\n   Djambi. The rhizome of _Pteridium aquilinum_, var. _esculentum_,\r\n   contains so much starch that it is used as food.\r\n\r\n   The other orders of true Ferns deviate from the Polypodiaceæ,\r\n   especially in the formation of the annulus, the bursting of the\r\n   sporangium and its mode of attachment and development, and in\r\n   the differences in the formation of the prothallium, etc. The\r\n   principal are:--\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Hymenophyllaceæ.= To this order belong the lowest and most\r\nMoss-like Ferns; the leaves, with the exception of the veins, are\r\nmost frequently formed of _only one layer of cells_, and consequently\r\nstomata are wanting; the formation of the prothallium also somewhat\r\nresembles the Mosses. Sori marginal, on the _extremities of the\r\nvascular bundles_, and surrounded by a _cupular indusium_. The\r\nsporangia are sessile, with equatorial annulus. _Hymenophyllum_ (_H.\r\ntunbridgense_, European). _Trichomanes_ (_T. speciosum_, European).\r\nSpecies about 200, which live especially on rocks and trees in damp and\r\nshady tropical forests. Some have no roots.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Cyatheaceæ.= Annulus _complete_ and oblique. To this order\r\nbelong, principally, the tree-like Ferns with palm-like habit. The\r\nnumber of species is about 200, they are all tropical and form forests\r\nin some regions of Australia. _Cibotium_ and _Dicksonia_ have marginal\r\nsori, with cupular, basal indusium. (The stem of _D. antarctica_ is\r\ncovered with aerial roots.) _Alsophila_ (without indusium); _Cyathea_\r\nwith cupular, inferior indusium (Fig. 212 _E_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 213.--_Gleichenia_: _A_ part of a leaf with\r\n  sori; _B_ a single sorus.]\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Gleicheniaceæ.= Sporangia with equatorial annulus, and\r\nlongitudinal dehiscence, most frequently groups of 3–4 in sori without\r\nindusium (Fig. 213). _Gleichenia_: the apical growth of the leaves\r\ncontinues for a long time.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Schizæaceæ.= Annulus apical. To this order belongs _Aneimia_,\r\nwhich is so commonly cultivated in conservatories. The two lowest pinnæ\r\nare metamorphosed, having no leaf parenchyma and being covered with\r\nsporangia. _Schizæa. Mohria. Lygodium_, a climber, whose leaves\r\nhave unlimited growth and attain a length of several metres. About 70\r\nspecies. Tropical.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Osmundaceæ.= The sporangia have at the apex a lateral group\r\nof strongly thickened cells, which gradually pass over into the\r\nordinary cells. The sporangia open by a longitudinal cleft.

In _Salvinia_ the microspores remain embedded in a\r\nhard mucilaginous mass (at first frothy) which fills up the cavity of\r\nthe sporangium. The prothallium must therefore grow out through this\r\nslime and also through the wall of the sporangium (Fig. 214), and it\r\nthus terminates in a relatively long cell.\r\n\r\nIn _Marsilia_ the microspores are set free from the microsporangium,\r\nand the prothallia, with the antheridia, remain in them until the\r\nspermatozoids are liberated. The latter are spirally-twisted threads.\r\n\r\nThe MACROSPORES, on germination, give rise to a very reduced\r\nprothallium, which in _Salvinia_ bears 3 archegonia; but, if these\r\nare not fertilised, the prothallium may continue to grow and become a\r\nfairly large, green body with several archegonia (Fig. 215 _A_, _B_).\r\nIn _Marsilia_ the prothallium is still more reduced, it is enclosed\r\nin the macrospore, and only bears one archegonium. The archegonia are\r\nsimilar in structure to those of the Ferns, but are smaller, and sunk\r\nmore deeply in the tissue of the prothallium.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 216.--_Salvinia natans. A_ An archegonium,\r\n  unripe, seen in longitudinal section: _h_ the neck-cells; _k_ the\r\n  neck-canal-cells; _c_ the central cell. _B_ An open archegonium\r\n  of which the neck-cells have separated off. _C_ An open, old\r\n  archegonium seen from the top.]\r\n\r\n=The asexual generation= is developed from the fertilised egg-cell.\r\nIt is a dorsiventral, horizontal shoot. In _Salvinia_ it bears at\r\nfirst a shield-like leaf, the scutiform leaf (Fig. 215 _C_, _a_),\r\nwhich is succeeded by the ordinary foliage-leaves. The young plants of\r\n_Marsilia_, likewise, have less perfect leaves in the very early stage.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the sporangium is the same as in the Leptosporangiate\r\nFerns. (The 16 spore-mother-cells originate from one central,\r\ntetrahedric archesporium.)\r\n\r\nThe Hydropterideæ are divided into 2 orders, the chief differences\r\nbetween them being found in the asexual generation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 217.--_Salvinia natans_ (natural size): _A_\r\n  seen from above, floating on the water; _B_ a portion seen from\r\n  the side in its natural position in the water.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 218.--Sori of _Salvinia_ in longitudinal\r\n  section: _h_ microsporangia; _m_ macrosporangia. (× 10.)]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Salviniaceæ.= This order more nearly approaches the true\r\nFerns, especially so on account of the form of the indusium. Only one\r\nspecies is found in Europe, _Salvinia natans_ (Fig. 217). This is a\r\nsmall, floating, annual, aquatic plant, entirely _destitute of roots_.\r\nThe dorsiventral, horizontal stem bears two kinds of leaves, which\r\nare arranged in whorls of three. Two of these which turn upwards are\r\noval, entire, “_aerial foliage-leaves_” (Fig. 217 B, _b^2_-_b^3_);\r\nthe third, the “_water-leaf_” (_b^1_) is submerged and divided into a\r\nnumber of hair-like segments, similar to the submerged leaves in many\r\naquatic plants, for instance, Water-buttercup (see also Fig. 215 _C_).\r\nThe whorls of leaves alternate with each other; there are thus 4 rows\r\nof dorsally-placed aerial leaves, and two rows of ventrally-placed\r\nsubmerged leaves. The sporangia are situated in sori, each sorus\r\nbeing borne on a small column (receptacle or placenta) and enveloped\r\nby a _cupular_, but _entirely closed indusium_ (Fig. 218). _The sori\r\nare situated on the submerged leaves_ (Fig. 217 _B_, _s-s_) _and\r\nare unisexual_, _i.e._ each sorus contains microsporangia only, or\r\nmacrosporangia.\r\n\r\n   _Azolla_ belongs to this order. It is a very small, floating,\r\n   tropical water-plant (America and East India), with horizontal,\r\n   root-bearing stem. The stem branches profusely by lateral buds,\r\n   and bears the two rows of leaves on its dorsal side, the roots\r\n   on the ventral side. Each leaf is bifid, and  divided into an\r\n   upper dorsal, and a lower ventral portion. The upper segments\r\n   float on the surface of the water and are arranged like tiles\r\n   on a roof, each one overlapping its neighbour. In each floating\r\n   segment a large cavity is found, in which _Anabæna_ is always\r\n   present. The lower segments are submerged.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Marsiliaceæ.= The characteristic feature of this order,\r\nand one not possessed by other Fern-like plants, is that the sori\r\n(2–many) are enveloped _in leaf-segments_ which _close round them_\r\nand form a “sporocarp,” just in the same manner as the carpels, in\r\nthe Angiospermous Flowering-plants, close round the ovules and form\r\novaries. The sori contain both micro-and macrosporangia. When the\r\nspores are ripe, the sporocarp opens in order to disperse the spores\r\n(Fig. 220).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 219.--_Marsilia salvatrix_ (natural size):\r\n  _K_ terminal bud; _b_ leaves; _f_ sporocarps; _x_ point of\r\n  branching of petiole.]\r\n\r\nThe two genera (with 57 species, Temperate, Tropics) are land-and\r\nmarsh-plants, whose dorsiventral, creeping stem bears roots on the\r\nunder surface, and the leaves in two rows on the upper side (Figs.\r\n219, 221). The leaves of _Marsilia_ are compound, and divided into\r\nfour small leaflets springing from the apex of the petiole (Fig.\r\n219), and resemble the leaves of _Oxalis_. In the bud the leaves are\r\ncircinate (Fig. 219 _b_), and at night they exhibit the well-known\r\nsleep-movements. The sporocarps are borne on the petioles of the\r\nfertile leaves, near their bases (Fig. 219 _f_); they are oblong and\r\nresemble small beans, the outer cells being hard and sclerenchymatous,\r\nwhile the inner ones are divided into a number of loculi arranged in\r\ntwo rows. On germination, water is absorbed, the two sides separate\r\nslightly, as valves (Fig. 220 _A_), and a long vermiform mass of\r\ngelatinous, parenchymatous cells (Fig. 220), swollen by the water,\r\nemerges, bearing a large number of sori arranged pinnately. Each\r\nsorus (_sr_) is covered by a thin indusium. (The thin covering may be\r\nconsidered an indusium physiologically, though not morphologically).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 220.--_Marsilia salvatrix_: _A_ the\r\n  sporocarp commencing to germinate; _B_ a more advanced stage of\r\n  germination.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 221.--_Pilularia globulifera_ (natural size):\r\n  _s_ sporocarps; _b_ leaves; _k_ the growing point; _r_ roots.]\r\n\r\n   _Marsilia quadrifolia_, in Europe. Many species are found in\r\n   Australia. The nutritious sporocarps of _M. salvatrix_ were\r\n   the means of saving the Burke expedition in the interior of\r\n   Australia, and hence this species has earned its specific name.\r\n\r\n_Pilularia_ has linear leaves, without lamina. The sporocarps are\r\nspheroid (Fig. 221), brown and hard, and situated near the base of the\r\nleaves. They are 2–4 chambered and open by a corresponding number of\r\nvalves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Class 2. =Equisetinæ (Horsetails.)=\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this class have been described on page 204.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into two sub-classes:--\r\n\r\n1. THE ISOSPOROUS EQUISETINÆ. To this sub-class belong, with\r\ncertainty, only the EQUISETACEÆ now existent, which are\r\nrepresented by only one genus, _Equisetum_.\r\n\r\n2. THE HETEROSPOROUS EQUISETINÆ. Forms which are now extinct.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 222.--_Equisetum arvense._ The prothallium\r\n  highly magnified. _A_ Male; _s, s_ antheridia. _B_ Portion of a\r\n  female, cut through vertically; _œ œ_ archegonia, the central one\r\n  is fertilised; _h h_ root-hairs.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 223.--_Equisetum maximum._ Spermatozoids: _a_\r\n  shows them still enveloped by the mother-cell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Sub-Class 1. =Isosporous Equisetinæ.=\r\n\r\nOrder. =Equisetaceæ (Horsetails).=\r\n\r\n=The sexual generation.= The prothallium is green and leaf-like, as in\r\nthe majority of Ferns, but irregularly branched and curled. It is often\r\nunisexual. The male prothallia bear antheridia only, and are smaller\r\nand less branched (Fig. 222 _A_) than the female; the latter may attain\r\na diameter of ½ an inch, and bear archegonia only (Fig. 222 _B_). The\r\nantheridia and the archegonia resemble those of the Ferns, but the\r\nspermatozoids (Fig. 223) are larger and less twisted. On the last curve\r\nis situated a more or less elongated appendage of cytoplasm (Fig. 223\r\n_c_).\r\n\r\n=The asexual generation.= The embryo is similar to that of the Ferns.\r\nThe fully developed _Equisetum_ is a perennial herb, with widely\r\ncreeping (in some species tuberous) rhizome, from which extend erect,\r\naerial, most frequently annual shoots.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 224.--_Equisetum arvense_: _a_ fertile branch\r\n  with cone; _b_ vegetative shoot; _c_ cone; _d_ sporophylls.]\r\n\r\nThe vegetative aerial STEMS are divided into a number of\r\ninternodes by the whorls of leaves (Fig. 224). The internodes are\r\nhollow, the cavities being separated from each other by the transverse\r\npartitions of the solid nodes. The lower portion of the internode,\r\nwhich is encased by the leaves, has much thinner and softer cell-walls,\r\nso that the stem is easily separated into segments just above the\r\nnodes. Each internode has a large number of ridges and furrows,\r\nand bears at its apex a whorl of leaves whose number and position\r\ncorrespond to the ridges of the internode. As in the case of other\r\nverticillate plants, the whorls are placed alternately, one above\r\nthe other; the same arrangement is also found in the ridges on two\r\nsuccessive internodes. In addition to the large air-cavity in the\r\ncentre of each internode (the central cavity), a whorl of tubular\r\nair-passages is found in the cortex of the stems, opposite the furrows\r\n(vallecular canals). There is also a similar air-passage (carinal\r\ncanals) in each of the vascular bundles, which are placed in a ring,\r\none opposite each ridge, and therefore alternating with the vallecular\r\ncanals. The vascular bundles are _collateral_ as in the majority\r\nof Flowering-plants, but poorly developed. The xylem of each bundle\r\nconsists of two groups of annular or spiral vessels, close to the outer\r\nborder of the carinal canal, and two groups of scalariform tracheides,\r\neach placed on a radius passing through a group of spiral vessels.\r\nThe phloëm is placed between these four groups, each of which has\r\nonly a few vessels. The stiffness of the stems is mainly due to the\r\nlarge amount of silica in the cell-walls of the epidermis, and to the\r\nsclerenchymatous cells of the ridges.\r\n\r\nAll LEAVES are situated in _whorls_. The VEGETATIVE are simple,\r\nundivided, 1-nerved, and are united into toothed sheaths (Fig. 224 _a_,\r\n_b_). The branching of the stems in some species (_E. arvense_) is very\r\nabundant. The branches break through the base of the leaf-sheaths (Fig.\r\n224 _b_), and generally _alternate with the teeth_ (leaves).\r\n\r\nThe FERTILE LEAVES (_sporophylls_) are different from the barren ones.\r\nThey are _free, shield-like_, each one having a short stalk bearing\r\nusually an hexagonal plate (Fig. 224 _d_), and closely compressed into\r\nan ear or cone (Fig. 224 _a_, _c_). The _Equisetums_ thus present an\r\nadvance in development distinctly beyond that of the Ferns, which is\r\nfurther emphasized by the circumstance that a transition from the\r\nsheath-leaves to the fertile-leaves is found in the involucre or\r\nannulus, a “collar” of specially modified leaves situated at the base\r\nof the cone (Fig. 224 _a_ and _c_). The cone may be considered as a\r\nvery rudimentary flower, and the annulus may be regarded as a very\r\nearly stage in the formation of a flower (perianth). See page 235.\r\n\r\nThe SPORANGIA are situated on the underside of the sporophylls, one\r\nat each angle; they are sac-like, and open inwardly by a longitudinal\r\ncleft (Fig. 224 _d_). An annulus is wanting; but in the wall of the\r\nsporangium, as in the pollen-sacs of the Flowering-plants, a layer of\r\ncells, with annular or spiral thickenings, is developed, which assists\r\nin the dehiscence of the sporangium.\r\n\r\nThe SPORES are green; the walls composed of four distinct layers,\r\nof which the outer is gradually separated, except at one point, and\r\nbecomes split into four long bands (_elaters_) (Fig. 225). The elaters\r\nare extremely hygroscopic, coiling round the spore when moistened, and\r\nexpanding as soon as dry, presenting a most lively object under the\r\nmicroscope when breathed upon and allowed to dry. The second layer,\r\nwhen germination commences, becomes detached from the inner wall, which\r\nis formed of the exospore and endospore.\r\n\r\nThe order has become much reduced, and at the present time includes\r\nonly one genus, _Equisetum_, with about twenty-five species, which are\r\ndistributed over the entire globe, particularly in damp situations. In\r\nSOME SPECIES the barren shoots are green and very much branched, but\r\nthe fertile ones are unbranched, pale brown, and possess no chlorophyll\r\n(_E. arvense_, Field-Horsetail, Fig. 224, and _E. maximum_). IN\r\nOTHERS the fertile and barren shoots are alike green, and either both\r\nunbranched (_E. hiemale_), or branched (_E. palustre_, _E. limosum_,\r\netc). The fertile shoots of _E. silvaticum_, up to maturity, resemble\r\nthose without chylorophyll of _E. arvense_, but after that period they\r\nproduce green branches, and thus resemble the barren ones.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 225.--Spores of _Equisetum_: _A_ damp, with\r\n  elaters (_e_) coiled round the spore; _B_ dry, with elaters\r\n  expanded.]\r\n\r\n   EXTINCT ISOSPOROUS EQUISETINÆ. In addition to several true\r\n   species of fossilized _Equisetums_, the order of the CALAMITES,\r\n   which no doubt is closely allied to the Equisetinæ, is also\r\n   found in the fossil state. These were gigantic forms, attaining\r\n   about twenty times the size of those of the present day, and\r\n   stems of nearly 10–12 metres in height are known. They reached\r\n   the culminating point of their development in the Carboniferous\r\n   period, and died out towards the close of the Palæozoic. The\r\n   stems had hollow internodes and alternating grooves, similar\r\n   to their relatives of the present day. The leaves must either\r\n   have been absent or very perishable, since they have not been\r\n   identified with certainty. If the determinations of certain\r\n   remains of cones which of late have been discovered are correct,\r\n   they were heterosporous and had two kinds of sporangia as in\r\n   the following sub-class. A cambium formation and an increase in\r\n   thickness has been found in the stems.\r\n\r\n   Their USES are very limited. A few species, such as _E. hiemale_\r\n   are used for polishing on account of the hard siliceous\r\n   cell-walls of the epidermis, found in all species of _Equisetum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Sub-Class 2. =Heterosporous Equisetinæ.=\r\n\r\n   The two orders which come under this head are united by the\r\n   characteristics, that the verticillate leaves are not united\r\n   into sheaths (Fig. 226), and that between each whorl of fertile\r\n   leaves there is also a whorl of barren ones. The fertile whorls\r\n   in ANNULARIÆ are situated about midway between the barren ones\r\n   (Fig. 227), but in ASTEROPHYLLITEÆ they occur immediately above\r\n   a barren whorl (Fig. 228) and contain only half as many members\r\n   as the latter. The lower whorls bear macrosporangia with one\r\n   macrospore, the upper, microsporangia with many microspores.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 226.--A. fragment of _Annularia_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 227.--Fragment of _Annularia longifolia_,\r\n  with sporangia; the leaves have partly fallen off: a barren\r\n  whorls; _s_ fertile whorls.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 228.--Fragment of cone of _Asterophyllites_\r\n  (_Volkmannia elongata_): _a_ and _s_ as in Fig. 227.]\r\n\r\n   The ANNULARIÆ were distichous (Fig. 226), and presumably\r\n   floating plants. The ASTEROPHYLLITEÆ had verticellate branches.\r\n   These also died out after the Carboniferous period, at the close\r\n   of the Palæozoic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Class 3. =Lycopodinæ= (=Club-Mosses=).\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this class have been given on page 205. It\r\nconsists of two sub-classes, one embracing isosporous, the other\r\nheterosporous forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Sub-Class 1. =Lycopodieæ= (ISOSPOROUS Lycopodinæ).\r\n\r\nOne kind of spore. Prothallium large, partly green. Leaves without\r\nligule.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 229.--_Lycopodium annotinum_: _A_ embryo\r\n  (nat. size), with prothallium (_pr_), one embryo is broken off;\r\n  _B_ the prothallium (slightly magnified); _C_ section through\r\n  the prothallium and embryo in the direction _a-b_ of _A_, and\r\n  vertically in the plane of the paper.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 230.--_Lycopodium clavatum_: portion of a\r\n  stem, bearing cones (_a_); _s_ a spore; _h_ sporangium in the\r\n  axil of a leaf, _s_.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Lycopodiaceæ.= The PROTHALLIUM is only known in a few species\r\nat present, but in these it is more or less tubercular, and bears both\r\nantheridia and archegonia.\r\n\r\n   In _L. annotinum_ the prothallium is a relatively large mass\r\n   of cells, without chlorophyll, and subterranean, in which\r\n   the antheridia and archegonia are embedded (Fig. 229). In\r\n   the widely distributed tropical species, _L. cernuum_, and\r\n   in _L. inundatum_, it is a small tubercular body which has a\r\n   subterranean portion, with either little or no chlorophyll;\r\n   and an aerial green portion. The prothallia of _L. phlegmaria_\r\n   and others live saprophytically in the crevices of the bark of\r\n   trees; they are partly filamentous, branched, and possess no\r\n   chlorophyll.\r\n\r\nThe =asexual generation=. PERENNIAL PLANTS. The stem branches\r\nmonopodially (often apparently dichotomously), and is thickly covered\r\nby small, simple, triangular or scale-like leaves. The leaves are\r\nspirally arranged in some species (Figs. 229, 230), and in others,\r\nwhose stem is compressed with unequal sides, opposite (Fig. 231). The\r\nroots of _Lycopodium_ are dichotomously branched.\r\n\r\nThe SPORANGIA in _Lycopodium_ are situated singly at the base of the\r\nleaves, almost in their axils; they are reniform, unilocular and open\r\nlike a mussel-shell by two valves (Fig. 230 _h_). The sporangia are\r\ndeveloped from a group of surface cells. The archesporium is formed\r\nfrom one hypodermal cell (or perhaps a cell-row).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 231.--_Lycopodium complanatum_: _a_ leaves on\r\n  the edges of the stem; _d_ leaves on the sides.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 232.--_Lycopodium clavatum._ A tetrahedral\r\n  spore seen from above, where the three borders join; and a tetrad\r\n  of bilateral spores, still lying in the mother-cell.]\r\n\r\nThe fertile leaves are collected upon definite regions of the stem.\r\nThey are either similar to the barren ones, and then the fertile\r\nportions of the stem pass gradually, without any break, into the barren\r\nportion (_L. selago_); or they differ from the barren leaves, and are\r\nthen collected into special apical cones (Fig. 230 _a_). The SPORES are\r\ntetrahedral or bilateral (Fig. 232).\r\n\r\nAbout 100 species, chiefly tropical.\r\n\r\n   Five species of _Lycopodium_ are found in Great Britain. _L.\r\n   clavatum_ and _L. selago_ are common in mountainous districts.\r\n   _L. annotinum_ is common in the Highlands of Scotland. The other\r\n   genus of the order is _Phylloglossum_, with one species, _P.\r\n   drummondi_ (Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand), a small plant\r\n   only a few centimetres high, with two tubers, and about eleven\r\n   linear leaves at the base of the stem which is terminated by a\r\n   cone of sporophylls.--FOSSIL Lycopodiaceæ in the Carboniferous\r\n   period.\r\n\r\n   OFFICINAL: “Lycopodium,” the spores of _L. clavatum_.\r\n\r\n   Family 2. =Psilotaceæ=. The sporangia are placed on the apex of\r\n   short, two-leaved stems, as 2–3, seldom four, small capsules.\r\n   Small herbs, with angular stems; leaves small, simple, and one\r\n   nerved. Only four species.--_Psilotum_ (Madagascar, Moluccas,\r\n   Sandwich Islands, etc.) is destitute of roots, their place being\r\n   supplied by special underground stems which bear a few modified\r\n   leaves, very much reduced, especially when buried deeply in the\r\n   soil. Three species.--_Tmesipteris_ (Australia), one species.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Sub-Class 2. =Selaginelleæ= (HETEROSPOROUS Lycopodinæ).\r\n\r\nMicro-and macrospores. The prothallia are very much reduced, especially\r\nthe male; the female does not leave the spore. The leaves are ligulate.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 233.--Germination of the microspores of\r\n  _Selaginella_: _A_ the spore rendered transparent, seen from\r\n  above. In the interior is seen the prothallium (_f_), and the\r\n  first divisions of the antheridium (_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_); in _B_\r\n  the spore-wall is removed and all the spermatozoid-mother-cells\r\n  formed; in _C_, the microspore has opened and the spermatozoids\r\n  and the mother-cells are escaping together.]\r\n\r\n=The sexual generation.= In the ~MICROSPORES~ are formed: (1) a very\r\nsmall “vegetative” cell, representing the vegetative part of the\r\nprothallium (_f_ in Fig. 233 _A, B_), and (2) a cell many times larger\r\nand which divides into a number (4–8) of primordial cells, each of\r\nwhich divides into four spermatozoid-mother-cells, though all of these\r\nmay not develope spermatozoids. On germination, when the spore-wall is\r\nruptured, the spermatozoids and spermatozoid-mother-cells are ejected\r\ninto the water.\r\n\r\nThe ~SPERMATOZOIDS~ in _Selaginella_ are elongated and club-shaped,\r\nwith two cilia (Fig. 234); but in _Isoëtes lacustris_ they are\r\nspirally-twisted threads which differ from all other spermatozoids by\r\nhaving a bunch of cilia _at each end_; the other species of _Isoëtes_\r\nhave cilia only at the anterior end.\r\n\r\nThe MACROSPORES. Shortly after the macrospores have been set free,\r\nor in _Selaginella_, while still enclosed in the sporangium of the\r\nmother-plant, they germinate and soon become filled with the cellular\r\ntissue of the prothallium, and even in _Selaginella_ the archegonium\r\nbegins to be formed before the rupture of the spore-cell-wall has\r\ncommenced (Fig. 235 _A_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 234.--Spermatozoids of _Selaginella_: _b_\r\n  with a remnant of cytoplasm.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 235.--Macrospore of _Selaginella_: _A_\r\n  longitudinal section, before the rupture of the wall, six\r\n  weeks after being sown.

It will be noticed that the neck is formed of two\r\n  tiers of four cells each.]\r\n\r\nThe ARCHEGONIA are constructed on the same plan as those of the other\r\nArchegoniatæ, but are quite embedded in the prothallium (Figs. 235 _æ_,\r\n236).\r\n\r\n=The asexual generation= varies very much in the different orders.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 237.--_Isoëtes lacustris_ (slightly\r\n  diminished): _st_ the stem; _r_ roots; _b_ leaves.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 238.--_Isoëtes lacustris_.

Cone in\r\n  longitudinal section; microsporangia are seen on the left side,\r\n  macrosporangia on the right (most frequently each with four\r\n  macrospores).]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Isoëtaceæ (Quill-worts).= The only known genus, _Isoëtes_\r\n(Quill-wort), has an extremely short, tuberous, _unbranched_ stem\r\nwith very short internodes (Fig. 237). The STEM is remarkable as\r\nbeing the only one among the Vascular Cryptogams which increases in\r\nthickness (see page 202). The meristematic cells are situated round\r\nthe axial cylinder, and form, especially, parenchymatous tissue in\r\ntwo or three directions, giving rise to 2–3 grooves in which the\r\ndichotomously-branched ROOTS are produced. The LEAVES are arranged\r\nspirally in a close rosette. They are awl-shaped and have at the\r\nbase a semi-amplexicaul sheath, with a groove (_fovea_), in which a\r\nsporangium is situated (Fig. 238). The ligule is a foliar outgrowth\r\nfrom the upper edge of the groove.--The MACROSPORANGIA (each with\r\na number of macrospores), are situated on the outer leaves, the\r\nMICROSPORANGIA (Fig. 238), on the inner ones. Between each cycle of\r\nfertile leaves there are a number of imperfect or barren ones as in\r\nthe case of the female plant of _Cycas_. The spores are liberated by\r\nthe decay of the sporangium. The two kinds of sporangia develope at\r\nthe commencement in the same way. The archesporium is, at first, a\r\nhypodermal layer of cells which grow out in the direction perpendicular\r\nto the surface of the leaf, and divide by a number of walls parallel\r\nto this direction, forming a sporogenous mass of cells. Some of the\r\ncell-rows of this sporogenous mass lose their rich protoplasmic\r\ncontents, and are arrested in their growth; thus incomplete divisional\r\nwalls of sterile cells, “_trabeculæ_” arise in the sporangium,\r\ndividing it into a number of compartments one above the other (Fig.\r\n238 _t_). (The trabeculæ, according to Goebel, play the same part as\r\nthe nutritive cells of the sporangium of _Riella_; the tapetal cells,\r\nas in the Ferns, are in a great measure dissolved at a later period.)\r\nThe sporogenous cell-rows, in the microsporangia, give rise to a\r\nlarge number of spore-mother-cells, but in the macrosporangia only\r\none spore-mother-cell, with tapetum, is developed from each fertile\r\narchesporial cell.\r\n\r\nThe two native species, and several others, are aquatic plants, the\r\nremaining species are land plants, or are amphibious. About 50 species.\r\nIn temperate and tropical regions.--FOSSIL species in the Tertiary\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Selaginellaceæ.= This order contains only one genus,\r\n_Selaginella_. The STEM, in the majority of species, is dorsiventral,\r\nlong and slender, and apparently branches dichotomously, but in reality\r\n_monopodially_, with well developed lateral shoots. The LEAVES are\r\nsmall, round, or ovate, in the majority of species arranged in whorls\r\nof two leaves each; these whorls, however, are not decussate, but are\r\nconsiderably inclined towards each other, an arrangement by which four\r\nrows of leaves are produced, each whorl having one large and one small\r\nleaf. The two leaves in each whorl are of unequal size, the smaller one\r\nbeing placed on the upper surface and the larger on the lower surface\r\nof the stem (Fig. 240). Some species have spirally-arranged leaves,\r\nmore resembling the arrangement in the _Lycopodiums_.\r\n\r\nThe ~FERTILE LEAVES~ most frequently differ from the barren ones,\r\nand are collected into spike-like cones (a kind of flower; Fig.\r\n239). Micro-and macrosporangia are found in the same cone (Fig.\r\n239). Each sporangium arises from a group of superficial cells of\r\nthe stem, directly over the leaf on which it will be situated later\r\non. Each sporangium has a hypodermal, unicellular archesporium, and\r\ncontains a layer of tapetal cells; these are dissolved later, when\r\nthe spores are ripe, and not before as in the Ferns. In the very\r\nearly stages of their development, the micro-and macrosporangia are\r\nprecisely similar, and the differences between them arise later on.\r\nIn the microsporangium all the spore-mother-cells divide, and each\r\nforms four tetrahedrically-arranged microspores (Fig. 204); but in\r\nthe macrosporangium only four macrospores are formed, by the division\r\nof a _single mother-cell_, while the remaining spore-mother-cells\r\nare aborted. It is rarely that the macrosporangia contain 2 or 8\r\nmacrospores.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 240.--_Selaginella martensii_: _s_ lower\r\n  leaves; _r_ upper leaves.]\r\n\r\n   For the ~GERMINATION OF THE SPORES~, see pages 228, 229. The\r\n   prothallium arises in the macrospore (_f-f_, in Fig. 235 _A_),\r\n   probably by division of the meniscus-shaped protoplasmic mass,\r\n   which is marked off at the apex of the spore; primordial cells\r\n   are thus formed which later on are surrounded by a cell-wall. In\r\n   six to seven weeks after sowing, the spore-wall is ruptured by\r\n   the growing prothallium, which already has developed archegonia\r\n   (Fig. 235 _œ-œ_). The prothallium so formed does not occupy\r\n   the entire cavity of the spore, but four to five weeks after\r\n   sowing, the large-celled parenchyma is developed in the lower\r\n   portion of the spore by free cell-formation; this has been\r\n   termed by Pfeffer, “endosperm,” since it is similar to the\r\n   endosperm of Flowering-plants. Goebel, however, has termed it\r\n   “secondary prothallium,” as the homology with the endosperm of\r\n   the Angiosperms is very doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe ~FERTILISED OOSPHERE~ divides into an upper (hypobasal) and a lower\r\n(epibasal) cell; from the latter alone the embryo is developed with\r\nits root, stem, foot, and two _cotyledons_, and the former gives rise\r\nto an organ which appears in this instance for the first time, but\r\nwhich occurs in all Flowering-plants, viz. the _suspensor_. This forces\r\nthe embryo down into the “endosperm,” which is entirely or partially\r\nabsorbed by the embryo. In the case of the Flowering-plants the embryo\r\nis developed with its longitudinal axis in the elongation of the\r\nsuspensor, but in _Selaginella_ the embryo is situated _transversely_\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n_Selaginella_ (300–400 species), is essentially tropical, only one\r\nspecies living in the North (_S. spinulosa_), but others grow in\r\nCentral and South Europe.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Lepidodendraceæ= are extinct, tree-like Lycopods,\r\n   which are found especially in the Lower and Middle\r\n   Carboniferous. Vegetatively they are most nearly related to\r\n   _Lycopodium_, but the stem attained much larger proportions\r\n   (about eleven metres in height and one metre in thickness),\r\n   and had a cambium by which it increased in thickness. It was\r\n   regularly dichotomous, and closely studded with spirally-placed\r\n   leaves, which left behind them peculiar rhombic scars. The large\r\n   cones resemble Pine-cones, and bore sporangia much larger than\r\n   any which are now produced (the male ones as much as 2 cm.’s in\r\n   length). The macrosporangia were situated at the base, and the\r\n   microsporangia at the apex.\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Sigillariaceæ.= These are, presumably, another\r\n   group of extinct tree-like Lycopods (especially in the Middle\r\n   Carboniferous). The name has been derived from the seal-like\r\n   scars, which the fallen leaves have left behind in longitudinal\r\n   rows on the grooved stem. The rhizomes of these plants were\r\n   formerly termed _Stigmaria_, and placed in a separate genus.\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Sphenophyllaceæ= form an entirely extinct group.\r\n   They do not definitely belong to any of the three large\r\n   classes of Vascular Cryptogams, but it is perhaps best to\r\n   place them in juxtaposition to these. They were herbaceous\r\n   plants with verticillate, wedge-shaped leaves, with nerves\r\n   branching dichotomously into equally strong branches. Micro-and\r\n   macrosporangia were formed in the same cone; and were situated\r\n   in the axils of the leaves, as in the Lycopods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Transition from the Cryptogams to the Phanerogams.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the plants considered in the preceding chapters are included\r\nin the term CRYPTOGAMS; all in the following chapters under the\r\nhead of PHANEROGAMS (see page 3). Hofmeister’s pioneer works\r\n(1851, _Vergleichende Untersuchungen der höheren Kryptogamen_,\r\netc.) and the numerous researches published later by other\r\ninvestigators, have closed the gap which was formerly thought\r\nto exist between these plants; so that we now, in the series:\r\nBryophyta--Pteridophyta--Gymnospermæ--Angiospermæ see the expression of\r\na single line of development in accordance with a definite plan. The\r\nforms through which this gradual development has taken place have in\r\ncourse of time, however, to a great extent died out, and only single\r\nlinks of the chain connecting the lowest to the highest still remain.\r\n\r\nTHE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS, which we found indicated in certain\r\nThallophytes, can be proved with the greatest clearness in all the\r\nhigher Cryptogams, from the Mosses upwards; it is also found in the\r\nPhanerogams, but not in such a pronounced degree, because one of\r\nthe generations is so far reduced that it has almost given up its\r\nindependence. For the sake of greater clearness, we will begin with the\r\ncomparison of the sporophyte, asexual (second) generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n           =The asexual (2nd) generation of the Cormophytes.=\r\n\r\nThe asexual generation which follows from the further development of\r\nthe fertilised oosphere, is, in the _Mosses_, only the sporogonium\r\n(according to one theory it is perhaps homologous with a spore-bearing\r\nleaf, situated upon a short stem, see p. 187); in _Filicinæ_,\r\n_Equisetinæ_, and _Lycopodinæ_, on the other hand, it is a highly\r\ndeveloped plant differentiated into stem, leaf, and true root, and\r\nbearing the sporangia on its leaves. The ~MODIFICATION OF THE SHOOT~\r\nis very slight in _Filicinæ_. The first leaves of the embryo are very\r\nsimple in form (Fig. 205), but after a certain age all the leaves\r\nwhich arise are essentially alike. The fertile leaves do not differ\r\nfrom the barren ones, and are found associated with them, and their\r\nformation does not limit the growth in length of the stem. It is only\r\nin a few of the true Ferns, and in the Hydropterideæ, that the fertile\r\nleaves differ considerably from the barren ones. A division of labour\r\nin which certain leaves are set apart for nutrition, and others for\r\nreproduction, is found more pronouncedly in the _Equisetinæ_ and\r\n_Lycopodinæ_, for in these groups, with a few exceptions, the fertile\r\nand barren leaves are very dissimilar; the former are collected in\r\nspecial ear-like _cones_, which _terminate the further growth_ of\r\nthe short stems on which they are borne. In connection with the cone,\r\nleaves are sometimes developed which form a transition from the barren\r\nto the fertile ones (the “annulus” in Equisetaceæ), and in these cases\r\nthe first indication of a flower with perianth or floral-leaves is to\r\nbe traced. Among the Cryptogams the highest division of labour is found\r\nin _Selaginella_ and _Isoëtes_, which have the two kinds of sporangia\r\nborne on _different_ leaves. The division of labour (modification) is,\r\nhowever, still more pronounced in the _Phanerogams_: the leaves which\r\nbear the microsporangia (“pollen-sacs”) have quite different forms\r\nfrom those which bear macrosporangia (the “nucellus” in the ovule),\r\nthe former are termed _stamens_, the latter _carpels_; in certain\r\ninstances, too, there is even a contrast between the “male plants” and\r\nthe “female plants.” Moreover, a division of labour, in a much greater\r\ndegree, takes place in the leaves which do not directly take part in\r\nreproduction, and it is thus possible in many plants to draw a sharp\r\nline not only between stamens and carpels, but also between four or\r\nfive distinct kinds of leaves, which differ in _form_, _structure_, and\r\ncorresponding _functions_, and which appear in regular sequence on the\r\nshoot: namely, between “scale-leaves” and “foliage-leaves,”[21] both\r\nof which occur in the Cryptogams, and the “floral-leaves,” including\r\nthe bracts and leaves of the “perianth,” which latter often differ from\r\neach other in form and colour, and are then separated into _sepals_ and\r\n_petals_. The _leaves_--stamens and carpels--_which bear the sporangia_\r\nare termed sporophylls, and the shoot, or extremity of a shoot, whose\r\nleaves are modified into sporophylls, is _terminated in its further\r\ngrowth by their production, and is known as a flower_. The flower\r\nwhich is most completely furnished has calyx, corolla, stamens, and\r\ncarpels arranged in this order. If the only sporophylls present are\r\nstamens, then it is said to be a _male_ (_staminate_) flower, and if\r\nonly carpels, then a _female_ (_pistillate_) flower, and in both these\r\ncases the flowers are _unisexual_, or diclinous. If stamens and carpels\r\nare both present in the same flower, it is termed _hermaphrodite_.\r\nDiclinous plants in which the female flowers are situated on one plant,\r\nand the male flowers on another, are termed _diœcious_; and those\r\nin which the same plant bears the two kinds of flowers are termed\r\n_monœcious_. When the male, female, and hermaphrodite flowers are found\r\nin the same species, the plant is said to be _polygamous_.\r\n\r\n=The sporangia-bearing leaves--Sporophylls.= In the Mosses the\r\nasexual generation is only represented by the sporogonium, and if the\r\ntheory is correct which considers the sporogonium to be an embryo\r\nconsisting of a rudimentary stem and terminal leaf, then the spores are\r\nproduced on the leaves in these plants. The sporangia in the Filicinæ\r\nare situated in groups (sori) on the back or on the edge of the leaves.\r\nThe number of sporangia in the sorus diminishes very greatly in the\r\nMarattiaceæ and Gleicheniaceæ (three to four in the latter, Fig. 213).\r\nIn the Equisetinæ the sporangia are situated in a small number on the\r\nunderside of shield-like leaves, and in Lycopodinæ, singly, in the\r\naxils of the fertile leaves, which are alike and bear either micro- or\r\nmacrosporangia. In the Phanerogams there is a great difference between\r\nthe stamens and carpels.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 241.--_Cycas_: _a_ stamen (nat. size) seen\r\n  from the under side; _b_ four pollen-sacs, not yet open, forming\r\n  a “sorus”; _c_ three open pollen-sacs; _d_ a pollen-grain.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 242.--Stamens of _Araucaria_ (pollen-sacs\r\n  long and pendulous).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 243.--Male flower of _Taxus_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 244.--_A_ Cross section through a\r\n  quadrilocular anther in different stages of development: _s_ the\r\n  seam where it bursts open; _vf_ vascular bundle; _k_ connective.\r\n  _B_ A stamen. _C_ Another stamen seen from the front (_f_) and\r\n  from the back (_b_).]\r\n\r\n=Stamens.= In the lowest Phanerogams (_Cycadeæ_) there are many\r\nindications of relationship to the Ferns. The stamens are flat and\r\nbroad, and have _on the back many pollen-sacs_ (_microsporangia_)\r\narranged in small groups (true _sori_), which even have a small\r\n“placenta,” similar to the one possessed by the Ferns, and open towards\r\nthe inside by a longitudinal cleft (Fig. 241, compare Fig. 213). A\r\nsection of the _Coniferæ_ agree more closely with the Equisetaceæ, in\r\nhaving a few (three to eight) pollen-sacs arranged on the underside of\r\nmore or less shield-like leaves (Figs. 242, 243, compare with Fig. 224\r\n_a_, _c_, _d_). In the Abietaceæ the number of sporangia is diminished\r\nto two, which are placed also on the lower side (Fig. 267) of a stamen.\r\nThe number of _pollen-sacs_ (microsporangia) in the _Angiosperms_ is\r\nnearly always four to each stamen; they are longitudinal projections\r\nwhich are placed in pairs on each side of the central line of the\r\nstamen, two on the edge, and the other two generally on the side which\r\nis turned inwards; the pollen-sacs generally dehisce longitudinally\r\n(quadrilocular anthers, Fig. 244). A few, for instance Orchidaceæ and\r\nAsclepiadaceæ, have only two pollen-sacs (bilocular anthers); and in\r\nothers, such as _Solanum_ and the Ericaceæ, they open by pores; in\r\nLauraceæ and Berberidaceæ, by valves. The part of the stamen which\r\nbears the pollen-sacs is termed the _anther_. Most frequently this is\r\nsupported by a stalk known as the _filament_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 245.--A carpel of _Cycas revoluta_ with 5\r\n  ovules (_s_), at half to one-third nat. size.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 246.--Carpel with 2 ovules of _Ceratozamia\r\n  robusta_ (1/1).]\r\n\r\n=Carpels.= The simplest forms of carpels are found in _Cycas_. In\r\nthis genus both the foliage and fertile leaves are pinnate, and hence\r\npresent great similarity; the ovules (macrosporangia) are situated on\r\nthe margin of the central portion, just as the sporangia are placed\r\non the edge of the fertile leaf of _Ophioglossum_ (Fig. 245, compare\r\nwith Fig. 209). The carpels of the other Cycadeæ present greater\r\ndivergence from the foliage-leaves, being peltate, for instance, in\r\n_Zamia_ and _Ceratozamia_ (Fig. 246). The ovules in the Coniferæ are\r\nsituated on the upper side and near the base of the ovuliferous scales,\r\nalmost in the same position as the sporangia in the Lycopodinæ (Figs.\r\n269, 272, 273 _H_, compare Figs. 230, 239). In _Taxus_ the uninclosed\r\novule is placed on the apex of a shoot (Fig. 264). In all these plants\r\nthe ovules are _not enclosed_ by the carpels, that is, they are not\r\nenclosed in chambers formed by the turning in of the walls of the\r\ncarpel, and hence the name _Gymnospermæ_ is given to them. In the\r\nhigher Flowering-plants, the _Angiospermæ_, the ovules are distinctly\r\nsituated on the edge, the upper surface, or base of the carpel; but\r\nthe carpel closes round the ovules which are therefore enclosed in a\r\nchamber--the _ovary_. In a few cases, for example in the Polygonaceæ,\r\nan ovule is situated apparently on the apex of the stem itself, as\r\nin the Yew; in other cases, as in the Primulaceæ, many ovules are\r\napparently developed on the apex of the stem, which seems to have been\r\nspecially adapted as a placenta, but it is also possible and correct\r\nin these cases to suppose that the ovules are in reality developed\r\non the carpels.[22] A single fully-developed carpel or a collection\r\nof carpels joined together is termed the _pistil_. The extremity of\r\nthe carpel, which is specially developed to catch the pollen-grains\r\nand form a suitable nidus on which they may germinate, is called the\r\n_stigma_. The united edges of a carpel which bear the ovules are termed\r\nthe _ventral suture_. The back of the carpel forms the _dorsal suture_.\r\nThe Marsiliaceæ take a position among the Hydropterideæ analogous to\r\nthat occupied by the Angiosperms; the sporangia are in a corresponding\r\nmanner enveloped in a closed leaf.\r\n\r\nThe collection of stamens in a flower is termed the _andrœcium_,\r\nand all the carpels, whether individually free or united into one\r\npistil, the _gynœceum_.\r\n\r\nThe =Sporangia=. The asexual generation of the _Mosses_ is the\r\nsporogonium, in which the spores arise in tetrads from the\r\nmother-cells. The sporangia in the _Filicinæ_ take their origin either\r\nfrom a single cell (Leptosporangiatæ) or, what probably may be regarded\r\nas an older stand-point, from a group of cells (Eusporangiatæ). In both\r\ncases there may be distinguished in a mature sporangium three tissues,\r\nwhich have different significance (Fig. 204): (1) an external layer,\r\nthe _sporangium-wall_, most frequently composed of one layer of cells\r\nmade up of cells of dissimilar structure, so that on desiccation the\r\nwall is ruptured and the sporangium opens in a definite manner; (2)\r\nan internal group of cells, consisting of the _spore-mother-cells_,\r\ndeveloped from an archesporium, and which by division into four gives\r\nrise to the _spores_; (3) a layer of cells lying between the two\r\nalready mentioned, which is dissolved before maturity. The intermediate\r\ncellular layer, which directly surrounds the spore-forming cells, is in\r\nform and contents more worthy of note than the others, and is termed\r\nthe _tapetum_. The construction of the sporangium in the _Equisetinæ_\r\nand _Lycopodinæ_ is in the main the same.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 247.--Development of an anther. _A_\r\n  Transverse section of a young anther of _Doronicum macrophyllum_.\r\n  The formation of the 4 pollen-sacs commences by divisions of\r\n  the hypodermal cells (at _m_, for instance). These cells divide\r\n  by periclinal walls into external cells which only take part in\r\n  forming the anther-wall; and internal cells, which correspond to\r\n  the Archesporium, and from which the spores are derived. These\r\n  spore-forming cells are drawn with thicker walls in _B-E_.

The sub-epidermal layer becomes “fibrous,” and\r\n  the cells lying inside it become dissolved, together with the\r\n  tapetum.]\r\n\r\nIn the PHANEROGAMS the =Microsporangia= are termed =Pollen-sacs=.\r\nThey take their origin from a large group of cells, which, in the\r\nAngiosperms, lie immediately beneath the epidermal cells of the anther.\r\nIn the developed, but not yet mature, sporangium (pollen-sac) there are\r\nto be found: (as in the Vascular Cryptogams) (1) an internal group of\r\nmother-cells which give rise to the _pollen-grains_ (_microspores_),\r\nin this case also formed in tetrads; (2) a group of cells surrounding\r\nthese, of which the internal ones form a _tapetal layer_, similar to\r\nthat in the Vascular Cryptogams; the tapetum and some of the cells\r\nsurrounding it in this group, become dissolved before maturity; the\r\nmore external ones, on the other hand, are provided with peculiar\r\nthickenings, and form the “fibrous” layer by the aid of which the\r\ndehiscence of the anther takes place; (3) an external layer, the\r\nepidermis, enclosing all the other layers (Fig. 247).\r\n\r\n   In some Coniferæ (_Cupressus_, _Thuja_, and several species\r\n   of _Juniperus_) the microsporangia (pollen-sacs), which are\r\n   situated on the under side of the stamen, are covered by a\r\n   thin structure which seems to be a continuation of the lamina\r\n   and which is supposed to be homologous with the indusium of the\r\n   Ferns.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 248.--Development of the ovule in the Red\r\n  Currant, _Ribes rubrum_, arranged alphabetically in the order\r\n  of development. _A_ Is the youngest stage, _E_ the oldest. _ii_\r\n  Inner integument; _ie_ outer integument; _nc_ nucellus; _m_\r\n  archespore (mother-cell of the embryo-sac).]\r\n\r\n=The Ovule= in the Phanerogams arises most frequently on a projecting\r\nportion of the carpel, termed the _placenta_. The ovules (compare the\r\nsporangium of the Eusporangiatæ and especially the pollen-sac) take\r\ntheir origin from a _group of cells which lies beneath the epidermis_\r\n(Fig. 248 _A_, _B_). First of all a small papilla is formed, which is\r\nlater on provided with a _vascular bundle_ and becomes the _funicle_;\r\nthis probably has the same value as the projections (“placenta”) on\r\nwhich the sori in the Ferns are attached. Only _one_ =macrosporangium=\r\n(_nucellus_; Fig. 248 _nc_) is developed at the apex of the funicle.\r\nThis arises by a process of cell-division exactly corresponding to\r\nthat by which the pollen-sacs are formed (Fig. 248 _C-E_), with this\r\ndifference only, that while a great _many_ cells may be distinguished\r\nin each pollen-sac, which forms pollen-grains by tetrad-division, only\r\na few are found in the ovule, and all these moreover are _suppressed,\r\nwith one single exception_ which developes into the =macrospore=\r\n(=embryo-sac=) without undergoing a division into tetrads. The wall of\r\nthe embryo-sac, in the Gymnosperms, may be thick and divided into two\r\nlayers and partly cuticularized, as in the spores of the Cryptogams\r\nwhich are to be set free. In the Angiosperms, on the other hand, the\r\nwall is extremely thin.\r\n\r\nThe pollen-sac thus stands in the same relation to the nucellus as the\r\nmicrosporangium does to the macrosporangium: in the pollen-sacs and\r\nmicrosporangia a _number_ of spores arise by the tetrad-division of\r\nseveral mother-cells; in the nucellus and macrosporangium, a reduction\r\nof the cells already formed takes place to such an extent that the\r\nnumber of macrospores becomes one (_Salvinia_, _Marsilia_, Phanerogams)\r\nor four (_Selaginella_), or rarely a large number as in _Isoëtes_.\r\n\r\nIn the Ferns, as stated on page 210, etc., _indusia_ covering the\r\nsori very often occur. Horsetails and Club-Mosses have no indusium;\r\nbut in all Phanerogams cupular or sac-like structures (_integuments_)\r\nare found which envelop the nucellus. These develope from the upper\r\nend of the funicle (_ii_ and _ie_, in Fig. 248; _y_ and _i_, in Fig.\r\n249) and enclose the nucellus on all sides as a sac, leaving only a\r\nsmall channel at the apex of the nucellus--the _micropyle_--(Fig. 249)\r\nthrough which the pollen-tube proceeds to the embryo-sac. The ovules\r\nof the Gymnosperms have only one integument (Figs. 251, 264, 269, 274)\r\nand the same is the case with the majority of the Sympetalæ and a few\r\nChoripetalæ; but the Monocotyledons and most of the Choripetalæ have\r\ntwo integuments (Fig. 249).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 249.--Various forms of ovules: _A_ an erect\r\n  ovule (_orthotropous_); _B_ reversed (_anatropous_); _C_ curved\r\n  (_campylotropous_): _k_ the nucellus (shaded in all the figures);\r\n  _s_ the embryo-sac; _ch_ the base of the ovule (chalaza); _y_\r\n  and _i_ the external and internal integuments, the dotted line\r\n  denotes the place where the scar (_hilum_) will form when the\r\n  seed is detached from the funicle.]\r\n\r\nIn shape the integuments resemble very closely the cupular indusium of\r\nthe Hymenophyllaceæ, certain Cyatheaceæ (Fig. 212 _E_), and _Salvinia_\r\n(Fig. 218); that they are really homologous with these is probable, but\r\nis not proven. Some authorities regard them as structures found only in\r\nthe Phanerogams.\r\n\r\nThe ovule is thus a “_monangic_” (_i.e._ reduced to 1 sporangium, the\r\n_nucellus_) _sorus_, situated on a funicle, and enclosed by one or two\r\ncupular _indusia_, the integuments. Some of the ovules are _erect_\r\n(_orthotropous_), others _curved_ (_campylotropous_), the majority\r\n_reversed_ (_anatropous_) (Fig. 249).\r\n\r\n   [Goebel (1884 and earlier) with Strasburger considered the\r\n   entire ovule of the Phanerogams as homologous with the\r\n   macrosporangium, the integuments however as new structures in\r\n   contradistinction to the Ferns: the funicle then corresponds\r\n   to the stalk of the sporangium. The integuments of the ovule\r\n   (according to Goebel, 1882) differ from the indusium of the\r\n   Fern-like plants in being developed from the basal portion of\r\n   the nucellus and are not, as in the Ferns and _Isoëtes_,\r\n   a portion (outgrowth) of the leaf which bears the sporangia\r\n   (_K_).]\r\n\r\nThe nucellus is the only macrosporangium which never opens; _the\r\nmacrospore remains enclosed in it_, and _the macrosporangium remains\r\nattached to the mother-plant_. It is therefore essential that the\r\n_method of fertilisation_ which is employed should be very different\r\nfrom that of the Cryptogams. _The pollen-grains must be transferred\r\nto the ovule_, and retained either by a drop of mucilage at the\r\nmicropyle (Gymnosperms) or by the stigma on the carpels (Angiosperms).\r\nFertilisation by spermatozoids, which are freely motile in water, is\r\nabandoned in the Phanerogams.\r\n\r\nMany other modifications, unknown in plants of more simple structure,\r\ntake place, for instance, in the shoots which bear the fertile\r\nleaves; especially in the form of the stem or _thalamus_ (hypogynous,\r\nperigynous, epigynous); in the development of the perianth which stands\r\nin intimate connection with the special means employed to effect\r\nfertilisation; with respect to the different grades of union found\r\nin the leaves; in the union of the flowers into aggregations of a\r\nhigher order (inflorescences), and at the same time the production of\r\n“floral-leaves” (page 235).\r\n\r\n\r\n               =The sexual generation. The Fertilisation.=\r\n\r\nThe sexual generation in the _Mosses_ is relatively well developed,\r\nbecause not only the protonema, but all the other vegetative parts\r\nof the Moss-plant, in addition to the archegonia and antheridia,\r\nbelong to it. In the groups which follow, a gradual but increasing\r\nreduction of the sexual generation takes place, and at the same\r\ntime an indication of sex is found in the prothallia, which finds\r\nexpression in the forms of the spores themselves. In the majority\r\nof cases among the _isosporous_ Vascular Cryptogams, the sexual\r\ngeneration--prothallium--is a green, leafy expansion which can sustain\r\nitself by the assimilation of carbonic acid, and by the absorption\r\nof nutriment from the soil by means of root-hairs. In some plants\r\n(_Ophioglossaceæ_, _Lycopodium annotinum_) the prothallium is a\r\nsubterranean, pale, tubercular body, but in these instances it is\r\nrelatively large. In the _heterosporous_ Vascular Cryptogams and\r\nin the _Phanerogams_, the prothallium is much more reduced, both as\r\nregards its size, and also with respect to the number and structure of\r\nthe antheridia and archegonia.\r\n\r\n1. =The Microspores.= The PROTHALLIUM in all Vascular Cryptogams which\r\nhave unequal spores, consists of a single, vegetative (barren) cell,\r\nwhich plays a very unimportant part in the life of the prothallium\r\n(Fig. 233 _A_). In _Salvinia_ it is somewhat elongated and tubular,\r\nbecause it must break through the sporangium (Fig. 214); but in other\r\ncases it is very small and lenticular. In all these plants only one\r\nantheridium is formed. In _Salvinia_ it consists of 2 cells whose walls\r\nare ruptured in order that the spermatozoids may be liberated (Fig. 214\r\n_B_, _C_). In _Marsilia_, _Isoëtes_, and _Selaginella_ the prothallium\r\ndoes not leave the spore, and consists for the most part of primordial\r\nspermatozoid-mother-cells _without cell-wall_, which on germination are\r\nejected so that the spermatozoids are set free.\r\n\r\nIn the Phanerogams, the microspores have from olden times been termed\r\n_pollen-grains_.\r\n\r\nIn the GYMNOSPERMS the prothallium is reduced to 1, 2 or 3 small cells,\r\nplaced on one side of the mature pollen-grain (at the top in Fig. 250\r\n_I_, _II_, and in Fig. 267 _N_) and which do not play any part in\r\nthe germination of the pollen-grain. The antheridium is represented\r\nby the remaining portions of the interior of the pollen-grain, that\r\nis, it consists of a large cell with a nucleus which does not even go\r\nso far as the antheridium of _Selaginella_ and become divided into\r\nspermatozoid-mother-cells without cell-wall, for even these cells are\r\nnot formed. The unicellular antheridium grows, on the germination of\r\nthe pollen-grain, into a tubular body known as the _pollen-tube_,\r\nformed from the inner wall of the pollen-grain (Fig. 250), which works\r\nits way down the micropyle to the oosphere. The fertilisation takes\r\nplace by diosmosis through the cell-wall, and consists here also of the\r\ncoalescence of the nucleus of the pollen-tube (the sperm-nucleus, male\r\npronucleus) with that of the oosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the ANGIOSPERMS the reductions proceed still further. The barren\r\ncell, which represents the prothallium, was in the last group separated\r\nfrom the antheridium by a true cell-wall, but in the Angiosperms a\r\nmembrane at most, but no firm cell-wall, is formed. The pollen-grain\r\ncontains two cells, a vegetative and a free generative cell. Both these\r\npass into the pollen-tube, but the vegetative cell disappears about\r\nthe time the pollen-tube reaches the ovule; while the generative cell\r\ndivides into two: one, the sperm-nucleus coalescing with the nucleus of\r\nthe oosphere, the other being absorbed (_Lilium_, after Guinard).\r\n\r\nThe Gymnosperms prove in yet another point that they are more\r\nclosely related to the Cryptogams than are the Angiosperms. When the\r\npollen-grain begins to germinate the external wall ruptures as in the\r\nCryptogams (Fig. 250), but in the Angiosperms special germ-pores are\r\nformed in the cell-wall for the emergence of the pollen-tube.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 250.--_I_ Pollen-grains of _Cupressus_; at\r\n  the top is seen one prothallium-cell. _II_ Germinating; _c_\r\n  pollen-tube; _a_ the extine; _b_ the intine.]\r\n\r\n2. =The Macrospores.= The prothallium in _Salvinia_ and _Marsilia_ is\r\nstill rather large, green, and capable of the independent assimilation\r\nof carbon. It projects more or less from the macrospore and bears\r\n(in _Marsilia_ only one, in _Salvinia_ several) archegonia, which\r\nhowever are embedded to a greater degree in the prothallium, and are\r\nmore reduced than the archegonia of the true Ferns and Horsetails\r\n(Figs. 215, 216). The prothallium is still more reduced in _Isoëtes_\r\nand _Selaginella_; _partly_ because it is smaller and is in a higher\r\ndegree enclosed in the spore, it also contains less chlorophyll, or\r\nis entirely without chlorophyll, and in consequence incapable of\r\nindependent existence, whilst the number of archegonia is less; and\r\n_partly_ because the archegonia are themselves reduced, the cells of\r\nthe neck are fewer and embedded to the level of the surface of the\r\nprothallium without any, or with only a very slight projection (Figs.\r\n235, 236).--Finally, the prothallium with its archegonia begins to\r\ndevelope in _Selaginella_ while the macrospore is still within its\r\nsporangium, and before it is set free from the mother-plant. After\r\nthe spores are set free and germination has commenced, the spore-wall\r\nruptures and the prothallium is exposed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 251.--Longitudinal section of ovule of _Abies\r\n  canadensis_. Inside the integument (_i_) is seen the nucellus,\r\n  _n_; _m_ the micropyle. In the interior of the nucellus is\r\n  seen an oval mass of cells, the endosperm, and at its top two\r\n  archegonia, _c_. The ovule is turned in such a way that the\r\n  micropyle points upwards, but usually it turns downward in the\r\n  _Abietineæ_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 252.--The apex of the nucellus (_n_) of\r\n  an ovule of _Abies_: _l_ long-shaped cells which guide the\r\n  pollen-tube; _s_ the wall of the macrospore (embryo-sac); _h_ the\r\n  neck-cells of the archegonium; _k_ the ventral canal-cell; and\r\n  _c_ the central cell (oosphere). The archegonia of the Cryptogams\r\n  should be compared with this (see pages 181, 208, 216).]\r\n\r\nThe GYMNOSPERMS go still further. The macrospore (embryo-sac)\r\ngerminates and forms internally a cellular tissue, designated in former\r\ntimes by the name of _albumen_ (endosperm), which is _homologous with\r\nthe prothallium_. It always _remains enclosed in the embryo-sac_, and\r\nis a parenchymatous mass containing a large supply of nourishment. In\r\nthe upper part of the endosperm a number of archegonia are developed\r\nwhich are in the main constructed in the same manner as those in the\r\nCryptogams, but are still more reduced, the neck consisting only of 4,\r\n2, or 1 cell (Figs. 251, 252). The ventral canal-cell is also formed,\r\nin the majority, as a small portion cut off from the large central\r\ncell just beneath the neck; the larger remaining portion becomes the\r\noosphere. When the pollen-tube has passed down to the oosphere (Fig.\r\n253) and fertilisation has been effected, the oospore commences a\r\ncell-formation, the final result of which is the formation of _an\r\nembryo_ (_the asexual generation_) which is provided with a thinner,\r\nlower end, termed the suspensor. The embryo is forced more or less\r\ninto the endosperm in which it may rest for a longer or shorter\r\ntime, and generally is developed to such an extent that it has a\r\ndistinct primary-root (radicle) and stem (plumule) with one or more\r\nembryo-leaves (cotyledons).\r\n\r\n   When the oosphere has been fertilised its nucleus sinks down\r\n   to its lower end, and by repeated division into two, forms\r\n   four cells lying in one plane (Fig. 253, see base of the left\r\n   archegonium). Three tiers of cells are now formed by transverse\r\n   division of these four. It is the intermediate one of these\r\n   which elongates and forms the suspensor, or four suspensors, if\r\n   they separate from each other, which push the lowermost four\r\n   cells deep down into the endosperm. It is from these four lower\r\n   cells that the embryo (or four embryos when the suspensors\r\n   separate) is developed, but never more than one embryo attains\r\n   full development. As several archegonia are contained in one and\r\n   the same ovule, all of which are capable of forming embryos,\r\n   there is the possibility that several embryos may be developed\r\n   in a seed (polyembryony), but usually only one embryo attains\r\n   perfect development.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 253.--The apex of the nucellus (_n_) of\r\n  _Abies_ in longitudinal section: _c_, _c_ the oospheres of\r\n  the two archegonia; the embryo-formation has commenced at the\r\n  bottom of the left archegonium; _s_ wall of the macrospore; _p_\r\n  pollen-grains; _r_ pollen-tubes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 254.--Embryo-sac of _Carex præcox_: _syn_\r\n  synergidæ; _kb_ the oosphere; _c_ the central nucleus; _ant_ the\r\n  antipodal cells.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the embryo is being developed, other changes\r\nare taking place in the ovule, especially in the integument which\r\nbecomes the shell of the seed (_testa_). The endosperm grows, and the\r\nembryo-sac supplants the cells of the nucellus. The _seed_ is now\r\nformed, and it consists in its most complete development, as in this\r\ninstance, of three parts:\r\n\r\n(1) The _testa of the seed_, formed by the enveloping integuments,\r\nwith the remainder of the tissue of the nucellus lying outside the\r\nembryo-sac (the macrosporangium).\r\n\r\n(2) The _endosperm_ or prothallium.\r\n\r\n(3) The _embryo_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 255.--Diagrammatic longitudinal section\r\n  through an anatropous ovule shortly after fertilisation; _a_\r\n  and _i_ are the two integuments; _f_ the funicle; _k_ the\r\n  nucellus; _S_ the embryo-sac, with the incipient formation of\r\n  nutritive-tissue; _E_ the embryo; _P_ the pollen-tube passing\r\n  through the micropyle (_n_) to the oosphere.]\r\n\r\nThe reduction in the ANGIOSPERMS is carried to the extreme limit. In\r\nthe embryo-sac (the macrospore) the nucleus by continued division\r\nproduces a prothallium consisting of primordial cells (Fig. 254).\r\nIn the upper end of the embryo-sac (which is nearest the micropyle)\r\nare three cells, two of which are termed the “co-operating cells”\r\n(_synergidæ_) and the third is the _oosphere_. Three others are\r\nplaced at the opposite end of the embryo-sac and are therefore termed\r\nthe “antipodal cells.” Finally, a large cell is also formed, which\r\noccupies the space between the two groups and whose cell-nucleus, the\r\ncentral definitive nucleus, lies in the centre of the embryo-sac.\r\nThese primordial cells are the slight remnant of the prothallium. The\r\nentire structure of the archegonium, with its neck and canal-cells,\r\nhas disappeared, and nothing is left but the indispensable _oosphere_.\r\nWhen the oosphere has been fertilised, and has commenced the cellular\r\ndivisions which lead to the formation of the embryo (Fig. 255), the\r\nsynergidæ and antipodal cells are absorbed, and a cell-formation\r\nbegins by a new process which emanates from the definitive nucleus and\r\nby which a parenchymatous cell-tissue, the nutritive-tissue, arises\r\nwhich may perhaps be considered as homologous with the endosperm of\r\nthe Gymnosperms. The difference is that the nutritive-tissue of the\r\nAngiosperms is formed in two parts with an intervening interruption;\r\nthe primary nutritive-tissue is first formed, and after fertilisation\r\nis absorbed, with the exception of one cell, which continues the\r\ndevelopment and gives rise to the nutritive-tissue proper, which is\r\nformed in the first instance of primordial cells, and later on of a\r\ncellular tissue; this nutritive-tissue formed in the embryo-sac is\r\ntermed “endosperm”; in a few instances[23] a tissue which is derived\r\nfrom the nucellus functions as nutritive-tissue, and is termed\r\n“perisperm.” In many plants the seeds, when ripe, contain a very\r\nrich nutritive-tissue, in addition to the embryo, for the purpose\r\nof its nourishment during germination. These are termed albuminous\r\n(endospermous) seeds, in distinction to the ex-albuminous, or those in\r\nwhich the nutritive-tissue is stored in the embryo itself, before it is\r\ncompletely developed, and used for its sustenance.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the changes which fertilisation produces in the ovule\r\nitself, it also gives the impetus to a series of changes in the\r\nentire shoot which bears the ovule. The perianth, stamens, and style,\r\ngenerally wither, because the part they play is at an end; the wall\r\nof the ovary grows and becomes the wall of the fruit (pericarp).\r\nThe entire gynœcium of a flower, transformed as a consequence of\r\nfertilisation, is termed a _fruit_. It consists of two parts, the\r\n_pericarp_ and the _seeds_, and according to the nature of the\r\npericarp, the fruit is termed a capsule, nut, berry, or drupe.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of the Phanerogams does not lie in the\r\nformation of the flower (although they may quite properly be termed\r\n“Flowering-plants”), because Equisetums and Lycopods have reproductive\r\nshoots as highly differentiated as those of certain Gymnosperms and\r\nother Phanerogams. As regards the SEXUAL GENERATION the characteristics\r\nare found:--(1) in its great reduction; (2) in the transmission of the\r\nmicrospore (pollen-grain) to the macrosporangium, and its germination,\r\nwith the formation of a _pollen-tube_ (antheridium), the protoplasm of\r\nwhich is not differentiated into spermatozoids; (3) in the fact that\r\nthe macrospore (embryo-sac) never leaves its sporangium (nucellus);\r\nand further in the Angiosperms, (4) in the peculiar development of the\r\nnutritive-tissue in two parts; and (5) in the great reduction of the\r\narchegonium.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ASEXUAL GENERATION the characteristic feature is that\r\nthis generation is formed whilst the sporangium is still attached to\r\nthe mother-plant, and for a long time is nourished by it; and that\r\nafter the sporangium has become detached from the mother-plant, it\r\nspends a longer or shorter resting period as the embryo in the seed\r\n(enveloped by the testa), and does not make its appearance until\r\nthe “germination” of the seed. In addition the shoot which bears\r\nsporangia undergoes greater modification than in the case of the\r\nFlowerless-plants.\r\n\r\nThe Phanerogams are separated into two Divisions as follows:--\r\n\r\nDivision 4. =Gymnospermæ.= The ovules, as well as the seeds, are borne\r\n_naked_ on the surface of _open carpels_, or on the apex of a stem\r\n(ovary wanting). The pollen-grains are conveyed by the wind to the\r\novules, and caught by drops of mucilage, secreted by the micropyle.\r\nA “stigma” is _wanting_. The entire _female prothallium_ (_the\r\nendosperm_), which serves for the nourishment of the embryo, is _formed\r\nbefore fertilisation_. The archegonia are _embedded in the upper part\r\nof the prothallium. The pollen-grains are “multicellular,” i.e._ there\r\nis always in their interior a distinct prothallium, formed by 1–3\r\ncells, and a larger cell which gives rise to the pollen-tube.\r\n\r\nDivision 5. =Angiospermæ.= The carpels surround the ovules and form\r\nan entirely closed chamber (_ovary_), in which the ovules mature and\r\nripen into seeds. The surface of a portion of the apex of the carpel\r\nis transformed into the “stigma,” which, by a sticky fluid and also by\r\nhair-structures, is capable of retaining the pollen-grains conveyed to\r\nit by the wind, or more frequently by insects. The pollen-tube grows\r\nfrom the stigma, through the “conducting cellular tissue” (_style_),\r\nto the ovules. The pollen-grains contain two cells, a vegetative and\r\na free generative cell. The latter passes into the pollen-tube and\r\nthere divides into two, one of which is the sperm-nucleus. The female\r\nprothallium, which is intended to serve as nutritive-tissue, is formed\r\n_after fertilisation_. Archegonia are wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DIVISION IV.\r\n\r\n                             GYMNOSPERMÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following characters should be added to those already given on page\r\n2:--\r\n\r\nThe Gymnosperms comprise only trees or shrubs. The flowers are always\r\n_unisexual_ and destitute of perianth (except _Gnetaceæ_); the female\r\nplant of _Cycas_ is the only one which has no flower. The MALE FLOWERS\r\nare constructed on the same type as the cones of the Horsetails and\r\nClub-Mosses, and are _most frequently long shoots_ (Figs. 243, 258, 260\r\n_A_, 267 _J_) bearing a number of spiral or verticillate stamens. The\r\nFEMALE FLOWERS are of a more varied structure (see the orders). The\r\nOVULE _is orthotropous_ (except _Podocarpus_ which is anatropous) and\r\nprojects from the carpel uprightly, inverted, or horizontally; it has\r\nusually _only one integument_ (compare however Taxaceæ) which proceeds\r\nfrom the upper part of the nucellus, so that the embryo-sac in part is\r\nplaced below the integuments (Figs. 251, 264). The drop of mucilage\r\nwhich catches the pollen-grains dries up and draws the pollen-grain\r\nthrough the micropyle to a space just above the nucellus--_the\r\npollen-chamber_--in which the germination of the pollen-grain commences.\r\n\r\nIn each seed, only one of the many embryos which are formed proceeds to\r\nits full development. The seed is always _endospermous_, and the embryo\r\nhas one, two, or a whorl of several cotyledons. A vigorous primary\r\nroot is developed on germination. THE VASCULAR BUNDLES in the stem are\r\narranged in a ring, and _increase in thickness_ takes place by a closed\r\ncambium-ring which forms bast (_phlœem_) externally, and wood (_xylem_)\r\ninternally with distinct annual rings, _as in the Dicotyledons_. Only\r\ncertain of the Cycadeæ deviate from this arrangement. The _secondary\r\nwood_ is very uniform, as it is almost exclusively _formed of\r\ntracheides_ with bordered pits, but _true vessels are wanting_; this\r\nalso indicates a relationship with the Pteridophyta (see page 202).\r\n\r\nThe Gymnosperms are biologically lower than the Angiosperms; they are\r\nwind-fertilised, and without extra floral-nectaries.\r\n\r\nThis Division embraces three classes: CYCADEÆ, CONIFERÆ, And GNETEÆ. It\r\nis no doubt monophyletic, and has taken its origin from heterosporous\r\nFerns, now extinct, most nearly related to the Ophioglossaceæ and\r\nMarattiaceæ. The Cycadeæ appear to be the oldest class. The Coniferæ\r\nare related to these through Ginkgo. The Gnetaceæ are more isolated.\r\nThe Division is not continued into the higher Flowering-plants; it has\r\nevidently attained its highest development, and is now in a retrograde\r\ncondition. The similarity which has often been pointed out between\r\ncertain Coniferæ and Lycopodinæ is only in analogous resemblances, and\r\ndoes not entitle one to suppose that there is a nearer relationship, or\r\nthat the former take their origin from the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Class 1. =Cycadeæ.=\r\n\r\nThe stem is very _rarely ramified_. The leaves are _large_, _pinnate_,\r\nand arranged spirally. The flowers are _diœcious, without perianth_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 256.--_Cycas circinalis_ (female plant). The\r\n  carpels are seen hanging from the top of the stem. Three leaves\r\n  with the leaflets still rolled up project almost vertically into\r\n  the air, from the centre of the crown.]\r\n\r\nThere is only one order, the =Cycadaceæ=.--In habit they resemble the\r\nFerns, especially the Tree-Ferns (compare Figs. 207 and 256). The stem\r\nis tubercular (Fig. 258), or cylindrical (Fig. 256), but not very tall\r\n(as much as about 12 metres), and very rarely ramified. [In Ceylon,\r\nunbranched specimens of _Cycas_ are rarely met with in the wild state.\r\nThe stems of _C. circinalis_ occasionally branch in greenhouses.]\r\n\r\nThe LEAVES are arranged spirally, and so closely together that no\r\nfree stem-surface is left between them, and have only a slight sheath\r\n(which is not amplexicaul, as in the Palms). They are compound (most\r\nfrequently pinnate; in _Bowenia_, bipinnate); in some genera the leaves\r\nare rolled up in various ways, resembling the vernation in Ferns (Fig.\r\n257); they are leathery and perennial. In some, stipules are present,\r\nas in the Marattiaceæ. Groups of scale-leaves alternate in the majority\r\nwith groups of foliage-leaves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 257.--_Cycas circinalis._ Part of a young\r\n  leaf with circinate leaflets.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 258.--A male plant of _Stangeria paradoxa_\r\n  (about 1/15 nat. size).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 259.--Female cone of _Zamia integrifolia_\r\n  (½-⅓ nat. size). The male cone is very similar externally.]\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are without perianth. The MALE FLOWER is sometimes an\r\nenormous collection of stamens (Fig. 258), which are flat in some\r\n(_Cycas_, Fig. 241), shield-like in others (_Zamia_, _Ceratozamia_)\r\nlike the sporophylls in Horsetail (Fig. 259); but in all, the\r\npollen-sacs are situated in large and varying numbers on the back of\r\nthe stamens, and arranged in groups of 2–5, like the sporangia in the\r\nsori of the Ferns (Fig. 241 _b_, _c_). FEMALE FLOWERS _are wanting_ in\r\n_Cycas_, because the carpels do not terminate the apical growth of the\r\nstem. After a group of foliage-and of scale-leaves, a group of carpels\r\nis developed, which are pinnate and resemble the foliage-leaves,\r\nbearing on their edges a number of ovules (most frequently 5–6)\r\n(Figs. 245, 256); the same stem produces successively scale-leaves,\r\nfoliage-leaves, and carpels. The differentiation is not much more\r\nadvanced than in certain Ferns (_Struthiopteris_, _Blechnum_), where\r\nbarren and fertile leaves of different form regularly alternate. _The\r\nother genera have female flowers_; the carpels are shield-like in\r\n_Zamia_ and _Ceratozamia_ (Fig. 246), and collected into cone-like\r\nflowers, which terminate the growth of the stem (Fig. 259). The number\r\nof ovules in these instances is two to each carpel.\r\n\r\nThe SEEDS are large (most frequently 2–6 centimetres long) and\r\nplum-like; the external layer of the testa is fleshy, while the\r\ninternal one is hard and horny. There are two systems of vascular\r\nbundles in the testa, one outside, the other inside the stone. The\r\nembryo is straight, attached to the end of the suspensor, which is\r\noften long, filamentous, and rolled up; it has one or two cotyledons.\r\n\r\n   The embryo in _Ceratozamia_ and others is very slightly\r\n   developed, at the time when the ripe seed is detached from\r\n   the carpel; and it is not until after sowing that its further\r\n   development and germination proceed. This calls to mind the\r\n   Cryptogams, especially _Selaginella_, whose macrospores are\r\n   thrown off filled with endosperm; but the oosphere is not\r\n   fertilised till after the separation of the macrospore from the\r\n   parent-plant, while in the Cycadeæ fertilisation is effected\r\n   before the separation. In _Cycas_ the testa may rupture, and\r\n   the endosperm grow and become green in the light, even though\r\n   no embryo has been formed. This also is an indication of its\r\n   prothalloid nature.\r\n\r\n   Gum-passages are present in all organs. Collateral vascular\r\n   bundles, with spiral and scalariform tracheides, are found;\r\n   and normal thickening takes place by means of a cambium.\r\n   An exceptional mode of growth is found in _Cycas_ and\r\n   _Encephalartos_, the cambium ceases to divide after a time\r\n   and is replaced by a new cambium which arises in the cortical\r\n   parenchyma just outside the bast, and which forms a new ring\r\n   of xylem and phlœem. This may be repeated so that a number of\r\n   concentric rings are produced. In _Ceratozamia_, structures\r\n   resembling corals extend from the roots in a vertical direction\r\n   and appear on the surface of the soil; these are peculiar roots,\r\n   in which a symbiotic Alga (_Anabæna_) is found.\r\n\r\n   The Cycadeæ were formerly (from the Coal period to the Later\r\n   Cretaceous) far more numerous than at the present day. They\r\n   appear to have been most numerous in the Trias and Jurassic.\r\n   The remnant (75 species) which have persisted to the present\r\n   time are found in all tropical countries. _Cycas_ (Trop. and\r\n   Sub-trop., Eastern Hemisphere); _Dioon_ (Mexico); _Macrozamia_\r\n   (Australia); _Encephalartos_ (Trop. and S. Africa); _Stangeria_\r\n   (Fig. 258, Sub-trop. South and East Africa); _Bowenia_ (Trop.\r\n   Australia); _Ceratozamia_ (Mexico, New Granada, Western Brazil);\r\n   _Microcycas_ (Cuba); _Zamia_ (Trop. and Sub-trop. N. America.)\r\n\r\n   USES. Sago is made from the starch-containing pith of _Cycas\r\n   revoluta_ and _circinalis_. The leaves are often used at\r\n   funerals and church festivals, under the name of “palm-branches.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Class 2. =Coniferæ= (=Pine-trees=).\r\n\r\nThe stem _branches freely_. The leaves are _entire_, relatively small,\r\nlinear or reduced to scales. The flowers are without perianth. The\r\novules naked. It is seldom that the female flower is reduced to only\r\none carpel.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Cycadeæ principally resemble the Ferns, the Conifers partly\r\nresemble the Lycopods, and partly the Equisetums--the former especially\r\nin the _needle- or scale-like_, leathery, simple, and often perennial\r\nleaves (“evergreen plants”), which _never possess stipules_ (Figs. 263,\r\n270, 272). _Ginkgo_ deviates from this, being no doubt the oldest,\r\nand the Conifer which stands nearest to the Cycadeæ (Fig. 260). The\r\nresemblance to the Equisetums is especially owing to the fact that\r\nthe stem ramifies abundantly, and often very regularly, forming a\r\npyramid with verticillate branches. In addition to the foliage-leaves,\r\nscale-leaves (bud-scales) are present in the majority of species.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWERS are monœcious or more rarely diœcious. _Perianth is\r\nwanting._ The stamens of the _catkin-like male flowers_ (Fig. 267,\r\n_J_) are of different forms, but as a rule more or less shield-like.\r\nAs in the Cycadeæ, the pollen-sacs are in all cases situated _on the\r\nunderside_. There are, as a rule, two pollen-sacs (the Abietaceæ, Fig.\r\n267), or 3–5, (the Cupressaceæ and Taxaceæ, Fig. 243); a few have more,\r\n_e.g. Araucaria_ (Fig. 242); they dehisce by clefts.\r\n\r\nIf, in commencing our consideration of the _female flower_, we begin\r\nwith that of _Ginkgo_, we shall observe in the corner of a scale-\r\nor foliage-leaf a small flower, which consists of two carpels, each\r\nbearing one ovule, and reduced almost to the ovule itself (Fig. 260\r\n_C_, _D_). The flower in _Podocarpus_ is still further reduced, viz.\r\nto a single carpel with one ovule, which is anatropous and has two\r\ninteguments. This ovule is situated in the axil of a cover-scale (_c_,\r\nin Fig. 262 _D_), and several female flowers of this description are\r\ncollected in a small cone, the stalk and bracts of which become fleshy\r\n(Fig. 262 _C_). The external integument also becomes fleshy (an aril).\r\n_Dacrydium_, which is clearly related to _Podocarpus_, has an external\r\nintegument which developes more independently as a fleshy aril (Fig.\r\n262 _B_, _B’_). _Microcachrys_ also is clearly allied to these: the\r\nbracts are more fleshy, and the ovule (_i.e._ the female flower) is\r\nprotruded beyond the bract (Fig. 262 _A_, _A’_). _Taxus_ stands in a\r\nmore isolated position: a flower which has been reduced to an ovule is\r\nsituated, in this instance, on the apex of a secondary branch which is\r\nstudded with floral-leaves (Figs. 263, 264); an external integument\r\nis developed on all sides and surrounds the seed as a scarlet aril.\r\nAccording to this conception _the aril corresponds to an external\r\nintegument_, and the Taxoideæ thus possess a partly dichlamydeous\r\novule. Only _Ginkgo_ and _Cephalotaxus_ appear to deviate from this,\r\nas in these there is only one integument (unless the small outgrowth\r\nindicated by _ar_, in Fig. 260 _D_, really is a rudimentary, external\r\nintegument); in CYCADEÆ, to which _Ginkgo_ is most closely related,\r\nthere is likewise only one integument. But in these genera the testa\r\nis differentiated into two layers, and the seed resembles a drupe; like\r\nthe Cycadeæ there is an external fleshy covering and an internal hard\r\none, and these two layers may probably be considered homologous with\r\nthe two integuments. This theory is also borne out by the arrangement\r\nof the vascular bundles in _Cephalotaxus_ and _Podocarpus_, which\r\npresent the xylem in the fleshy external layer to the _outside_ of the\r\ntesta, which is therefore the upper side of the integument (Celakovsky).\r\n\r\nThe coalescence of the integuments into one is only slight in\r\n_Torreya_, more pronounced in _Podocarpus_ and strongest in\r\n_Cephalotaxus_ and _Ginkgo_. Celakovsky terms these ovules\r\n“holochlamydeous.”\r\n\r\nIf we pass from these to the order PINOIDEÆ, we find the female flowers\r\ncollected into catkin-like cones, which have been considered from\r\nvarious points of view to be sometimes single flowers, at other times\r\ncompound inflorescences. The structure in ABIETACEÆ is as follows: a\r\nnumber of spirally arranged, scale-like leaves, _cover-scales_ (Figs.\r\n267, 268), are situated on a long axis. In the axil of each cover-scale\r\na larger leaf-like projection, _the ovuliferous scale_, is borne,\r\nwhich turns the upper side towards its cover-scale (which is shown by\r\nthe fact that the wood of its vascular bundles is turned downwards\r\nand towards the wood in the bundles of the cover-scale: Fig. 269).\r\nTwo ovules, with micropyles turned towards the central axis, and with\r\napparently only one integument (Fig. 268), are situated on the dorsal\r\nside of each ovuliferous scale, _i.e._ the side turned away from the\r\ncover-scale. The ovuliferous scales grow after fertilisation, into the\r\nwoody or leathery “cone-scales,” which are usually much larger than the\r\ncover-scales. This ovuliferous scale with its axis may, according to\r\nCelakovsky, be considered as a dwarf-branch which is situated in the\r\naxil of the cover-scale, and bears two ovules (in the same way as in\r\n_Ginkgo_, one long-stalked flower, reduced to two ovules, is situated\r\nin the axil of a leaf), and _in this case the external integument of\r\nthe ovules_ is expanded into leaf-like bodies, which have united to\r\nform one “_symphyllodium_” (_ovuliferous scale_) which is inverted\r\nso that its dorsal side is turned upwards and bears the nucellus and\r\nthe other integument (“hemichlamydeous” ovules). The carpel itself\r\nis therefore in this instance extremely reduced. The keel, or (in\r\n_Pinus_) “mucro” (Fig. 268 _B_), which is found in several genera,\r\nrepresents then a third carpel, which is sterile. In the other orders\r\nof the Pinoideæ the cover-scales and ovuliferous scales grow more and\r\nmore together and finally form one structure, which also is termed a\r\n“cone-scale,” although from its development it cannot be homologous\r\nwith the cone-scales of the Abietaceæ. This connation is least in the\r\nTAXODIACEÆ and ARAUCARIACEÆ and may be traced on the upper surface\r\nof the “cone-scale” by the presence of a stronger or slighter ridge\r\nor pad, the free portion of the ovuliferous scale (Figs. 256, 266,\r\n269). It is most strongly pronounced in the CUPRESSACEÆ, in which the\r\ntwo scales form one single structure, the cone-scale (Fig. 274). The\r\nvascular bundles in the under portion corresponding to the cover-scale,\r\nhave the xylem towards the upper side as usual in leaves, whilst\r\nthe bundles present in the upper side of the cone-scale, which thus\r\nrepresents the ovuliferous scale, turn their xylem downwards. The\r\nhemichlamydeous ovules are then situated on the upper side of this\r\ncone-scale. According to this theory the CUPRESSACEÆ appear to be\r\nthe youngest type, a view which corresponds with their vegetative\r\nstructure. If there is only one ovule in these orders as in _Agathis_\r\n(Fig. 265) and _Araucaria_, then the flower is reduced to a single\r\ncarpel and one ovule, as in the case of _Dacrydium_ and _Microcachrys_.\r\nIf two or more ovules are present, then the same number of carpels may\r\nbe supposed to exist, the external integuments of their ovules being\r\ndeveloped into leaf-like structures which collaterally coalesce to form\r\na “symphyllodium,” or are suppressed.\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, which is based on the researches of\r\nCelakovsky, the female flowers of the Coniferæ may be classed thus:--\r\n\r\n1. In all cases situated in the axil of a bract and collected into\r\ncones, with numerous flowers or with few or one flower. In _Ginkgo_\r\nonly, are they situated in the axil of foliage- or scale-leaves.\r\n\r\n2. It is only in _Taxus_ that bracteoles are present.\r\n\r\n3. They are formed only from rudimentary carpels, in which the stem\r\ntakes no part.\r\n\r\n4. The number of carpels in each flower varies from one to many, most\r\nfrequently three, of which the central one remains sterile.\r\n\r\n5. Each carpel bears only one ovule. The flower which is formed of only\r\none carpel appears to consist of only one ovule.\r\n\r\n6. The ovule has in Taxaceæ either a double integument (Podocarpeæ,\r\nTaxeæ), of which the external is the “aril,” or, as in the Cycadeæ, a\r\nsingle one, which is homologous with the two united together.\r\n\r\n7. The external integument in the Pinoideæ is expanded to form a\r\nleaf-like structure--the ovuliferous scale--and bears on its dorsal\r\nside the ovules, which are thus only provided with one, and that the\r\ninner, integument.\r\n\r\n   This later interpretation of the female cones in the Coniferæ is\r\n   more probably correct than the older ones; that, however, which\r\n   appeared in the former issues of this book, may also be stated.\r\n   It was to the effect that each catkin-like female cone is in\r\n   reality a single flower; the cone-scales in the Cupressaceæ\r\n   were single leaves, namely carpels, which bore the ovules on\r\n   the side which is turned upwards; the division into two parts\r\n   which makes its appearance in the other orders, and becomes\r\n   most prominent in the Abietaceæ, was compared with the division\r\n   of a leaf into a barren and a fertile portion, which is found\r\n   especially in Ophioglossaceæ and Marsiliaceæ, or with the ligule\r\n   in _Isoëtes_.\r\n\r\nPOLLINATION is accomplished by means of the wind. At the period\r\nof pollination the leaves are always so widely separated from one\r\nanother, that the ovules can catch the pollen-grains carried to\r\nthem by the wind; this is often effected by the mucilaginous drops\r\nwhich appear at the micropyle, and by the evaporation of which the\r\npollen-grains are brought in contact with the nucellus. The entire cone\r\ngrows considerably as soon as fertilisation has taken place, and the\r\ncone-scales in Pinoideæ close together so that the seeds while maturing\r\nare enclosed, and it is not until the seeds are ready for distribution\r\nthat the cone-scales again become separated. In the Pinoideæ, the fully\r\ndeveloped ovuliferous scales are hard and woody; and in this condition\r\nthe collection of female flowers is termed a _cone_. In the Taxoideæ,\r\ntrue cones are the exception. 2–15 cotyledons are present, arranged in\r\na whorl.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of this class is the abundance of _resin_,\r\nwhich is to be found in isolated cells (especially in the cortex),\r\npartly in intercellular glands or passages (both in the cortex and\r\nwood). _Taxus_ is the only genus which has no resin.\r\n\r\n   There are about 350 species, mostly from the Northern Temperate\r\n   zone (especially North America and Siberia), where they grow\r\n   gregariously and form the most northern forests. The Juniper,\r\n   Scotch Fir, and Yew are natives of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThis class may be divided into two families:--\r\n\r\n1. =Taxoideæ.= The ovules have either one integument, the external\r\npart of which is fleshy, and the internal hard and stone-like; or two\r\ninteguments, of which the external is the fleshy and coloured “aril.”\r\n“Ovuliferous scales” are wanting. The cones are never woody, but are\r\ngenerally succulent, the bracts become fleshy, or cones usually are not\r\ndeveloped. The seeds project more or less freely beyond the bracts.\r\n\r\n2. =Pinoideæ.= The ovules have two integuments, the external one of\r\nwhich is leaf-like and becomes developed as the “ovuliferous scale”;\r\nif there are several of these in each flower they unite and form a\r\n“symphyllodium.” This may remain free or unite with the bract. The\r\ncones are most frequently woody, rarely succulent. The seeds are hidden\r\namong the cone-scales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Family 1. =Taxoideæ.=\r\n\r\nThis family, considered to be most nearly related to the Cycadeæ, also\r\nmade its appearance at a very early period. There is only one order.\r\n\r\nOrder. =Taxaceæ.= The characters have been given above.\r\n\r\n_A._ CEPHALOTAXEÆ is the oldest group, presumably the connecting\r\nlink between the Cycadeæ and the other Coniferæ. The flower consists\r\nnormally of two ovules. Aril wanting. One integument. Seeds\r\ndrupaceous.--The flowers in _Ginkgo biloba_ (_Salisburia_) are situated\r\nin the axil of foliage- or scale-leaves. The stamens bear only two\r\npollen-sacs (Fig. 260 _A_). The female flower has two ovules, placed\r\ntogether at the end of a long, bare axis (Fig. 260 _C_). Round the base\r\nof the ovule a small collar (_ar_, in Fig. 260 _D_) is found, which\r\nmay probably be considered homologous with the collar-like outgrowth\r\nwhich surrounds the base of the _Cycas_-ovule. The seed resembles a\r\nPlum, and has a fleshy external coat, surrounding a hard internal\r\nlayer. The embryo is developed after the seed has fallen off. The\r\nGinkgo-tree has long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, more or less indented,\r\nwith dichotomous veins resembling certain Ferns--the Adiantums. It is a\r\nnative of East Asia, and the only surviving species of a genus which in\r\nearlier times was very rich in species, and distributed over the entire\r\nNorthern Hemisphere. _Cephalotaxus_ (Eastern Asia) is related to it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 260.--_Ginkgo_ (nat. size): _A_ a branch with\r\n  a small flowering dwarf-branch (male flower); _B_ a leaf; _C_ a\r\n  flower with two ovules; _D_ a ripe seed; _ar_ collar.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 261.--_Phyllocladus glaucus_: a branch with\r\n  female flowers (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n_B._ PODOCARPEÆ. The female flower is reduced to one ovule, placed in\r\nthe axil of a bract, or a little forward upon it. The ovule has an\r\naril (2 integuments).--_Phyllocladus_ (Fig. 261), from New Zealand and\r\nTasmania, has obtained its name from its flat, _leaf-like branches_,\r\nthe leaves proper being scale-like (_f_). The ovules stand _erect_ in\r\nthe axil of the scale-like leaves (_c_), and several are collected at\r\nthe end of short branches.--_Microcachrys tetragona_ (Tasmania) has\r\na small female catkin with several spirally-placed, fleshy bracts,\r\nat the end of which the inward and downward turned ovule is attached\r\n(Fig. 262 _A_, _A’_). The ripe cones are red, succulent, and resemble\r\nStrawberries.--In _Dacrydium_ (Tasmania, New Zealand, Malaysia) the\r\nfemale cone has most frequently only 1–2 (–6) bracts, which resemble\r\nthe vegetative leaves; they have also a fleshy aril (Fig. 262 _B_,\r\n_B’_).--_Podocarpus_ (40 species, East Asia, S. Temp.); the bracts of\r\nthe female flowers become fleshy, and unite together; only 1 or 2 are\r\nof use in supporting the flowers. The ovules project high above the\r\napex of the bract, and are _anatropous_, the micropyle being turned\r\ndownwards (Fig. 262 _C_, _D_). An aril commences to develope in the\r\nflowering period as an external coating, and later on it becomes fleshy\r\nand coloured.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 262.--_A Microcachrys_: female cone (2/1).\r\n  _A’_ A single carpel with its ovule. _B Dacrydium_: branch with\r\n  female flower (3/1). _B’_ The flower; _cp_ the bract; _ar_ the\r\n  aril; _ov_ ovule. _C Podocarpus_: female flower with 2 ovules.\r\n  _D_ Another female flower with 1 ovule, in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 263.--_Taxus baccata_: branch with two ripe\r\n  seeds (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n_C._ TAXEÆ. The female flower is reduced to one ovule, which is\r\nsituated _terminally_ on an axis which bears 2–3 pairs of opposite,\r\nscale-like bracteoles; on this account the Taxeæ form a very isolated\r\ngroup among the Coniferæ.--_Taxus_ (_T. baccata_, the Yew-tree).\r\n_Diœcious_. _The female flower consists of only one ovule_, placed _at\r\nthe end_ of a short secondary branch (Fig. 264), which is studded with\r\nscale-like leaves. The aril when ripe is thick, fleshy, and scarlet\r\n(sometimes yellow), and only loosely envelopes the seed (Fig. 263).\r\nThe leaves are scattered, flat, linear, and pointed (Fig. 263, 264).\r\nThe short male flowers have 5–8 pollen-sacs, pendent from the stamens,\r\nand are surrounded at their bases by scale-like bracteoles (Fig. 243).\r\n_Torreya_ (4 species, N. America and Japan) is closely allied to\r\n_Taxus_. The aril ultimately fuses with the woody inner integument, and\r\nhence the ovule becomes drupaceous, as in Cephalotaxaceæ.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 264.--_Taxus baccata_: _A_ shoot of _Taxus_\r\n  with female flowers at the time when the ovules are ready for\r\n  pollination. _B_ Leaf with flower in its axil (nat. size). _C_\r\n  Longitudinal median section through a female shoot; _v_ growing\r\n  point of primary shoot; _a_ commencement of aril; _i_ integument;\r\n  _n_ nucellus; _m_ micropyle.]\r\n\r\n   USES. _Taxus baccata_ is usually planted in gardens, especially\r\n   in hedges. Its wood is very hard and is used for wood-carving.\r\n   The shoots are poisonous, but not the aril, which is often eaten\r\n   by children and by birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Family 2. =Pinoideæ.=\r\n\r\nThe four orders differ from one another partly in the arrangement of\r\nthe leaves (_Cupressaceæ_ have opposite or verticillately placed\r\nleaves, flowers, and inflorescences; in the others they are placed\r\nspirally), but chiefly in the greater or less degree of union which\r\ntakes place between the female flower (the leaf-like “symphyllodium”)\r\nand its supporting cover-scale, and in the position of the ovules (the\r\nmicropyle being turned upwards or downwards). The “cone-scales” in\r\n_Abietaceæ_ are formed by “symphyllodia” alone, in the others by\r\ntheir union with the cover-scale.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Araucariaceæ.= This order most frequently has _solitary_\r\novules, _turned downwards_ and attached _to the centre_ of the\r\ncone-scales. In _Agathis_ (_Dammara_) the arrangement is the most\r\nsimple, a winged seed (Fig. 265), which hangs _freely_ downwards, being\r\nborne in the centre of the undivided cone-scale. In _Araucaria_, the\r\nstamens with the _free, pendulous_ pollen-sacs have been represented\r\nin Fig. 242; the ovuliferous scale is united for nearly its whole\r\nlength with the bract, and projects from its apex in the shape of a\r\nsheath-like, dentate scale, resembling the ligule in _Isoëtes_, and may\r\ntherefore be termed a “ligule.” _Araucaria_ (S. America, Australia) has\r\noften rather broad leaves (_A. brasiliensis_). The ovuliferous scale in\r\n_Cunninghamia_ is more distinct, and stretches transversely over the\r\nentire cover-scale; it bears three inverted ovules (Fig. 266) (Eastern\r\nAsia).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 265.--_Agathis (Dammara) australis._\r\n  Cone-scale with the seed. _A_ Longitudinal section; _A’_ from\r\n  within; _fv_, _fv’_ vascular bundles; _v_ wing.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 266.--_Cunninghamia sinensis._ Cone-scale\r\n  with three ovules, interior view: _d_ cover-scale; _f_\r\n  ovuliferous scale.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 267.--_A-G Pseudotsuga douglasii_: _A_\r\n  cone, _B_ cone-scale, with the inner side turned forward; the\r\n  points of the cover-scale are seen behind it; _C-G_ transitions\r\n  from the acicular leaf to the cover scale, from the base of a\r\n  ♀ cone. _H Pinus montana._ Young ovuliferous scale, with the\r\n  inner side turned forward; the ovules are now in the stage for\r\n  pollination. _J-M Abies alba_: _J_ male cone; _b_ bud-scale;\r\n  _a_ anthers; _K L M_ individual anthers.--_Pinus montana_: _N_\r\n  pollen-grain; the two lateral expansions are the air-bladders; in\r\n  the upper part of the interior of the grain a vegetative cell may\r\n  be seen, and in the centre the large cell-nucleus.]\r\n\r\n   Dammara-resin, which is used for varnish, is obtained from\r\n   _Agathis_ (_Dammara_) species (New Zealand, Philippine\r\n   Islands).\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Abietaceæ (Pine and Fir Trees).= The leaves are spirally\r\narranged and needle-like. The flowers are _monœcious_. The male flowers\r\nare long, and catkin-like, with numerous stamens, each bearing two\r\n_oblong pollen-sacs_. The pollen-grains are most frequently tri-lobed,\r\nhaving two bladder-like appendages, formed as outgrowths of the\r\nexospore, to assist in their distribution by the wind (Fig. 267 _N_).\r\nThe bracts are arranged spirally. The union between the bract and the\r\novuliferous scale, which is found in the preceding order, is not in\r\nthis instance so complete; these scales make their appearance as two\r\nfree parts, and are attached only at their bases (Fig. 268); the lower\r\nportion, that is the cover-scale, in most instances remains quite\r\nsmall (Fir, Red Pine, and others), it is only in the “Noble Pine”\r\n(_Abies_) and _Pseudotsuga douglasii_, that it attains a greater length\r\nthan the ovuliferous scale (Fig. 267, _B-G_). On the other hand the\r\nupper part, _the ovuliferous scale_ (the vascular bundles of which have\r\nthe bast turned upwards), grows strongly and elongates, especially\r\nafter fertilisation, becoming woody or leathery; it is commonly termed\r\nthe “_cone-scale_,” but is in reality only homologous with a part of\r\nthe “cone-scale” in the other order of Pinoideæ. On the side of the\r\novuliferous scale, turned towards the axis, are situated _two ovules_\r\nwith micropyles _directed inwards_. The seeds are most frequently\r\nprovided with _a false wing_ (a tissue-like part of the surface of\r\nthe ovuliferous scale). Cotyledons, _more than_ 2, _verticillate_.\r\n_Fertilisation does not take place until some time after pollination._\r\nIn _Pinus_, for instance, the pollen-tube only penetrates the nucellus\r\nfor a short distance during the year of pollination, and then ceases\r\nits further growth, fertilisation not taking place until after the\r\nmiddle of the next year; whilst the seeds ripen about a year and a half\r\nafter pollination. In the Larch and others, the seeds are mature in the\r\nautumn succeeding pollination.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 268.--_A Abies_: _c_ the cover-scale;\r\n  _s_ ovuliferous scale, or “cone-scale”; _sk_ ovules in a young\r\n  condition. _B Pinus_: ovuliferous scale with two ovules (_s_);\r\n  _m_ the two-lobed micropyle; _c_ “mucro”; _b_ the cover-scale\r\n  behind. _C Abies_: ripe “cone-scale” with two seeds (_sa_); _f_\r\n  wing of seed.]\r\n\r\n_Abies_ (Fir). The leaves are often (_e.g. Ab. pectinata_) displaced\r\ninto 2 rows, flat and indented at the apex, with 2 white (wax-covered)\r\nlines on the under surface, in which the stomata are situated. The\r\nleaf-scars are nearly circular and do not project. The cones are erect.\r\n_The cover-scales and the ovuliferous scales separate from the axis_,\r\nto which they remain attached in other genera.--~_Tsuga_ has leaves\r\nlike _Abies_, but by the slightly projecting leaf-scars, and cones with\r\npersistent scales, it forms the transition to _Picea_.--_Pseudotsuga_\r\nhas leaves similar to those of _Abies_ and persistent carpels as in\r\n_Picea_, but the cover-scales grow as in _Abies_ and project beyond\r\nthe ovuliferous scales (_P. douglasii_, Fig. 267). These two genera\r\nare considered as sub-genera of _Abies_.~--_Picea_. The leaves project\r\non all sides, square and pointed; the leaf-scars are rhombic, on\r\nprojecting leaf-cushions. The cones are pendulous. The cover-scales are\r\nmuch shorter than the leathery, persisting ovuliferous scales.--The\r\ngenus _Larix_ (Larch) differs from all the others in having deciduous\r\nleaves (the three preceding have leaves which persist for eleven to\r\ntwelve years). It has _long-branches_ with linear foliage-leaves and\r\nshort, thick, _perennial dwarf-branches_, which each year form a new\r\nrosette of foliage-leaves, similar to those on the long-branches. The\r\nmale flowers and the erect cones resemble those of _Picea_, and are\r\nborne on dwarf-branches.--_Cedrus_ (Cedar) resembles _Larix_ to some\r\nextent, but has persistent leaves (_C. libani_, _C. deodara_).--_Pinus_\r\n(Pine) has long-branches and dwarf-branches. The leaves of the\r\nlong-branches are scale-like and not green; the dwarf-branches have\r\nvery limited growth, and persist for three years; they arise in the\r\naxils of the scales borne on the long-branches of the self-same year,\r\nand each bears 2–5 foliage-leaves, they are also surrounded at the base\r\nby a number of membranous bud-scales. The cone-scales have a _thick,\r\nrhomboid extremity_ (the “shield”).\r\n\r\n   The buds which develope into long-branches arise at the apex of\r\n   other long-branches, and being very close together, form false\r\n   whorls. The female cones occupy the position of long-branches,\r\n   and take about two years for their development. The male flowers\r\n   arise close together, and form a spike-like inflorescence at\r\n   the base of a long-branch of the same year. The male flowers\r\n   occupy the position of dwarf-branches, so that a female cone\r\n   may be considered to be a modified long-branch, and a male cone\r\n   a modified dwarf-branch. The main axis of the seedling has\r\n   needle-like leaves, similar to those found on the older parts,\r\n   and on dwarf-branches; it is not until some time later that\r\n   the dwarf-branches are developed and the permanent arrangement\r\n   attained.\r\n\r\n   USES. Several species are commonly cultivated in this country,\r\n   partly on heaths and moors, and partly in plantations and as\r\n   ornamental trees, such as Mountain Pine (_Pinus montana_, Cen.\r\n   Eur.); Austrian Pine (_P. laricio_, Eur.); Scotch Fir (_P.\r\n   silvestris_, Eur.); Weymouth Pine (_P. strobus_, N. Am.); common\r\n   Red Pine (_Picea excelsa_, Cen. and N. Eur.); White Pine (_P.\r\n   alba_, N. Am.); _Abies pectinata_ (Common Fir, S. and Cen. Eur);\r\n   _A. nordmanniana_ (Crimea, Caucasus); _A. balsamea_ (N. Am.);\r\n   _Tsuga canadensis_ (N. Am.); _Pseudotsuga douglasii_ (N.W. Am.);\r\n   Larch (_Larix europæa_, Alps, Carpathians); _L. sibirica_ (N.E.\r\n   Russia, Siberia).--The wood of many species, especially Pine,\r\n   on account of its lightness and because it is so easily worked,\r\n   is very well adapted for many useful purposes. The wood of the\r\n   Yew-tree is very hard and is used for ornamental turning. Resin\r\n   and Turpentine (_i.e._ Resin with essential oils, the name being\r\n   derived from the Terebinth-tree, from which formerly a similar\r\n   material was obtained) are extracted from _Pinus laricio_ and\r\n   _P. pinaster_. Oil of Turpentine is obtained by distillation of\r\n   turpentine with water; Tar by dry distillation of Pine-wood.\r\n   Canada-balsam is from North American _Abies_-species (_A.\r\n   balsamea_ and _Fraseri_). The officinal Turpentine is mainly\r\n   obtained from _Pinus pinaster_ (South of France), _P. tæda_,\r\n   _australis_, _strobus_ (Weymouth Pine) and other North American\r\n   species; more recently also from _P. silvestris_ (Scotch Fir),\r\n   _maritima_, _laricio_, _Picea excelsa_, and others; Venetian\r\n   Turpentine, from Larch (S. Eur.) Amber is resin from a Tertiary\r\n   plant (_Pityoxylon succiniferum_), closely related to the Pine,\r\n   which grew especially in the countries round the South-East\r\n   coast of the Baltic. _Pinus pinea_ (the Pine, S. Eur.) has\r\n   edible seeds and also _P. cembra_ (in Cen. Eur. and Siberia).\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Taxodiaceæ.= The vegetative leaves and cone-scales are\r\narranged spirally. The ovules (2–9) are situated either at the base\r\nof the ovuliferous scales, in which case they are erect; or at their\r\ncentre, when they are generally more or less inverted. The ovuliferous\r\nscale is more or less united with the cover-scale, and projects\r\nbeyond the surface of the cone-scale, like a comb (Fig. 269). The\r\nvascular bundles, which extend into the cover-scale, have the usual\r\nleaf-arrangement, viz. the wood placed above the bast; while those\r\nbundles which enter the ovuliferous scale have this arrangement of the\r\nbundles reversed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 269.--_Cryptomeria japonica._ Portion of\r\n  longitudinal section through female flower. _d_ cover-scale;\r\n  _f_ ovuliferous scale; _ov_ ovules; _fv_ and _fv’_ vascular\r\n  bundles; the xylem is indicated by a wavy line, and the phlœm by\r\n  a straight line.]\r\n\r\n   _Taxodium distichum_ (the North American “Swamp Cypress”) has\r\n   annual dwarf-branches, with distichous leaves, and cone-like\r\n   “pneumathodia.” In the Tertiary period it was very common in\r\n   the Polar regions. _Sequoia (Wellingtonia) gigantea_ is the\r\n   famous Californian Giant-Fir, or Mammoth-Tree, which attains\r\n   a height of 300 feet, a diameter of 36 feet, and is said to\r\n   live for 1,500 years. _Cryptomeria japonica_ (Japan, China) has\r\n   the least adnate ovuliferous scales; _Glyptostrobus_ (China);\r\n   _Arthrotaxis_ (Tasmania); _Sciadopitys verticillata_ (the only\r\n   species in Japan) has, like _Pinus_, scale-like leaves on\r\n   the long-branches, of which those which are situated at the\r\n   apex of the annual shoots support “double needles,” _i.e._\r\n   _dwarf-branches_ similar to the two-leaved dwarf-branches in\r\n   _Pinus_, but without bud-scales, and with the two leaves fused\r\n   together at the edges into one needle, which turns its upper\r\n   surface away from the long-branch.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Cupressaceæ= (=Cypresses=). _The leaves are opposite or\r\nverticillate_, sometimes acicular, but most frequently scale-like\r\n(Fig. 270). In the species with scale-like leaves, the seedlings\r\noften commence with acicular leaves (Fig. 272), and branches are\r\nsometimes found on the older plants which revert to this form, seeming\r\nto indicate that the acicular leaf was the original form (atavism).\r\nThe so-called “_Retinospora_” species are seedling-forms of _Biota_,\r\n_Thuja_, _Chamæcyparis_, which have been propagated by cuttings, and\r\nretain the seedling-form. The flowers are monœcious or diœcious. The\r\nmale flowers are short, and have shield-like stamens, bearing most\r\nfrequently several pollen-sacs. The cover-scales and ovuliferous scales\r\nare entirely fused together and form _undivided_ cone-scales, _opposite\r\nor whorled_; _the ovuliferous scales_ have slight projections near _the\r\nbase_ on which 1–2–several _erect ovules_ are developed (Fig. 274).\r\nMost frequently 2 cotyledons.--_Evergreen_ trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 270.--_Cupressus goveniana._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 271.--Portion of a branch of _Thuja\r\n  orientalis_ (magnified).

The leaves are scale-like.--_Thuja. Monœcious._\r\nCones oblong. The cone-scales are dry, as in the Cypress, but leathery\r\nand imbricate, and not shield-like; each cone-scale bears 2–3 seeds.\r\nThe leaves are most frequently dimorphic; those leaves which are\r\nsituated on the edges of the flat branches are compressed, and only\r\nthese bear buds, which are developed with great regularity, generally\r\nalternately, on both sides of the branch; those which are situated\r\non the flattened surfaces are pressed flat and broad, and never bear\r\nbranches (Fig. 271). Along the central line of each leaf there is a\r\nresin-canal (Fig. 271).--~_Chamæcyparis_, _Callitris_, _Libocedrus_,\r\n_Thujopsis_ (1 species: _T. dolabrata_; in Japan).~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 273.--Branch of Juniper with “berry-cones.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 274.--_Cupressus lawsoniana._ Longitudinal\r\n  section through female cone.

The\r\n   “berry-cone” of _J. communis_ is officinal, and is also used\r\n   for gin.--The wood of _J. virginiana_ (N. Am.) is known as red\r\n   cedar, and is used for lead-pencils. Sandarack resin is obtained\r\n   from _Callitris quadrivalvis_ (N.W. Africa).\r\n\r\n   THE FOLLOWING ARE CULTIVATED IN GARDENS:--_Thuja occidentalis_\r\n   (Arbor vitæ) (N.

There is only one\r\norder.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 275.--_Welwitschia mirabilis_ (considerably\r\n  reduced). The horizontal lines indicate the surface of the soil.]\r\n\r\n   Order. =Gnetaceæ.= The three known genera differ very much in\r\n   appearance. _Welwitschia mirabilis_ (from the deserts of South\r\n   Western Africa) is the oldest (?) genus now living. It resembles\r\n   a giant radish, in that the hypocotyl is the only part of the\r\n   main axis of the stem which becomes developed. It attains a\r\n   circumference of upwards of four metres with a length of 1/2½-⅔\r\n   of a metre. It bears _only_ two oblong, leathery leaves (Fig.\r\n   275) which are torn into segments at the apex and lie on the\r\n   surface of the soil; these are the two first foliage-leaves\r\n   which succeed the cotyledons, and they are remarkable for\r\n   their enormous length (upwards of two metres) as well as for\r\n   their long duration, living as long as the plant itself. In\r\n   their axils are situated the 4-rowed, spike-like male and\r\n   scarlet-coloured female cones, upon dichotomous branches. The\r\n   perianth consists in the ♂ of 2 alternating pairs of leaves,\r\n   the inner ones of which are slightly united. The andrœcium\r\n   likewise consists of 2 whorls: the external (transverse) with\r\n   2, the internal with 4 stamens; the lower halves of the 6\r\n   filaments uniting to form a cup. Each of the terminal anthers\r\n   corresponds to a sorus of 3 sporangia, the sporangia being fused\r\n   together, and opening at the top by _one_ three-rayed cleft.\r\n   In the centre of the ♂-flower there is a sterile ovule. In the\r\n   ♀-flower a perianth of two connate leaves is present.--_Ephedra_\r\n   (desert plants, especially in the Mediterranean and W. Asia)\r\n   at first sight resembles an _Equisetum_; the stems are thin,\r\n   long-jointed, and the leaves opposite, small, and united into\r\n   a bidentate sheath; ♂-perianth of two connate leaves (median\r\n   leaves); 2–8 stamens united into a column. Each anther is formed\r\n   of 2 sporangia (is bilocular). ♀ mainly, as in _Welwitschia_.\r\n   The seeds are surrounded by the perianth which finally becomes\r\n   red and fleshy. There are 30 species.--_Gnetum_ has opposite,\r\n   lanceolate, pinnately-veined, leathery leaves. They are mostly\r\n   climbers (Lianas) from Tropical Asia and America. The ♂-flowers\r\n   have a tubular perianth, (formed from two median leaves) which\r\n   surrounds a centrally-placed filament, bearing 2 anthers. In\r\n   the ♀-flower there is a similar perianth, surrounding an ovule\r\n   provided with 2 integuments. The perianth becomes fleshy and\r\n   envelops the hard seed. 20 species.\r\n\r\n   From the circumstance of _Welwitschia_ having ♂ flowers\r\n   which, besides stamens, possess also a rudiment of an ovule,\r\n   Celakovsky draws the inference that the earliest Gymnosperms\r\n   had hermaphrodite flowers which from this structure became\r\n   differentiated entirely into ♂-and ♀-flowers, with the exception\r\n   of _Welwitschia_ only, in which this differentiation was only\r\n   carried out in the ♀-flower. This theory has so far been\r\n   scarcely proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Fossil Gymnosperms.=\r\n\r\n   The earliest continental plants which are known belong to the\r\n   CORDAITACEÆ, a group of plants which existed as early as the\r\n   Silurian period; they were Gymnosperms, but it has not yet been\r\n   determined whether they were Cycads or Conifers. The CYCADS,\r\n   even in the Coal period, were scarce; they attained their\r\n   fullest development in Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, during\r\n   which they were rich in species and genera, and extended as far\r\n   as the Polar regions. In addition to these, Taxaceæ, Abietaceæ,\r\n   and Taxodiaceæ appeared in the Carboniferous period. The TAXACEÆ\r\n   appear to have attained their culmination in the Jurassic and\r\n   Cretaceous periods; _Ginkgo_ appears in the Rhætic; _Torreya_,\r\n   in the Cretaceous; _Taxus_ and _Podocarpus_ in the Tertiary\r\n   periods. The ABIETACEÆ also appear in the Carboniferous;\r\n   _Pinus_ was first known with certainty in the English Weald\r\n   and in the Cretaceous; almost all other contemporary genera\r\n   are represented in this latter period. The ARAUCARIACEÆ first\r\n   appear, with certainty, in the Jurassic. The TAXODIACEÆ may\r\n   be traced back as far as the Carboniferous (?); _Sequoia_ is\r\n   first found in the lowest Cretaceous, at that period it spread\r\n   throughout the entire Arctic zone, and being represented by a\r\n   large number of species, formed an essential part of the forest\r\n   vegetation. _Sequoia_ played a similar part in the Tertiary\r\n   period. The CUPRESSACEÆ are first known with certainty in the\r\n   Jurassic, but they appeared more frequently and numerously in\r\n   the Tertiary period, in which most of the present living genera\r\n   were to be found. The GNETACEÆ, according to a theory advanced\r\n   by Renault were represented in the Coal period by the genus\r\n   _Stephanospermum_, which had four ovules enclosed by an envelope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DIVISION V.\r\n\r\n                             ANGIOSPERMÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee pages 3 and 224. To this Division belong the majority of the\r\nFlowering-plants. They are divided into two parallel classes, the\r\nMonocotyledons and the Dicotyledons, which differ from each other not\r\nonly in the number of cotyledons, which, with a few exceptions, is one\r\nin the former, two in the latter, but also in the internal structure\r\nof the stem, the venation of the leaves, the number of the parts of\r\nthe flower, etc. ~Assuming that these two classes have sprang from a\r\ncommon origin, it is amongst the Helobieæ in the first, and amongst the\r\nPolycarpicæ in the second class that we might expect to find closely\r\nallied forms, which might reasonably be supposed to have varied less\r\nfrom this original type. As for the rest, they seem to stand quite\r\nparallel, without exhibiting any close relationship. It is scarcely\r\nproved that the Monocotyledons are the older class.~\r\n\r\n[Our knowledge of the forms included under the Angiosperms has\r\nrecently been considerably increased by Treub (_Ann. d. Jar. Bot. d.\r\nBuitenzorg_, 1891), who has shown that the Casuarinas differ in many\r\nimportant points from the typical Angiosperms. Among other characters\r\nthe pollen-tube is found to enter the ovule near the chalaza and\r\ntherefore at the opposite end to the micropyle, and Treub therefore\r\nsuggests that these plants should be placed in a subdivision termed\r\nChalazogams.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view the principal divisions of the Angiosperms would\r\nbe represented thus:--\r\n\r\n                =Angiospermæ.=\r\n\r\n    Sub-division.

Linn.\r\nSoc._, 1894) that _Alnus_, _Corylus_, and _Carpinus_ also belong to the\r\nChalazogams.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge, however, is still so incomplete that one would hesitate\r\nto accord the full systematic value which Dr. Treub attaches to his\r\ndiscovery until the limits of the Chalazogamic group are better\r\ndefined; and it would hardly be justifiable to include the Casuarinas\r\nand the above-noted genera in one family.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Class 1. =Monocotyledones.=\r\n\r\n_The embryo has only one cotyledon; the leaves are as a rule scattered,\r\nwith parallel venation; the vascular bundles of the stem are closed,\r\nthere is no increase of thickness. The flower is typically constructed\r\nof five 3-merous whorls, placed alternately._\r\n\r\nTHE EMBRYO is generally small in proportion to the abundant endosperm\r\n(exceptions, see _Helobieæ_), and its single cotyledon is often\r\nsheath-like, and very large. On the germination of the seed either the\r\nentire cotyledon, or its apex only, most generally remains in the seed\r\nand absorbs the nutritive-tissue, while the lower portion elongates\r\nand pushes out the plumule and radicle, which then proceed with their\r\nfurther growth. The primary root in most cases soon ceases to grow,\r\nbut at the same time, however, numerous lateral roots break out from\r\nthe stem, and become as vigorous as the primary root, or even more so.\r\nIncrease in thickness does not take place in these roots; they branch\r\nvery little or not at all, and generally die after a longer or shorter\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTHE STEM is frequently a corm, bulb, or other variety of underground\r\nstem, as the majority of the Monocotyledons are perennial, herbaceous\r\nplants; it has scattered, closed vascular bundles (Fig. 276), and no\r\ncambium by which a continuous thickening may take place. The stem of\r\nthe Palms, however, attains a very considerable thickness, which is due\r\nto the meristem of its growing-point continually increasing in diameter\r\nfor a lengthened period (often for many years), until it has reached a\r\ncertain size. In this condition the growing-point has the form of an\r\ninverted cone, and it is only when this cone has attained its requisite\r\nsize that the formation of a vertical cylindrical stem commences.\r\nCertain tree-like Liliaceæ, as _Dracæna_, _Aloe_, etc., have a\r\ncontinuous increase in thickness; this is due to a meristematic layer,\r\nwhich arises in the cortex, outside the original vascular bundles,\r\nwhich were formed at the growing-point of the stem. This meristem\r\ncontinues to form thick-walled parenchyma and new, scattered vascular\r\nbundles. The primary vascular bundles, in the Palms and others, run\r\nin a curved line from their entrance into the stem at the base of\r\nthe leaf, towards the centre of the stem, and then bend outwards and\r\nproceed downwards in a direction more parallel to the sides of the stem\r\n(Fig. 277). The bundles formed later, in those stems which increase in\r\nthickness, are not continued into the leaves.\r\n\r\nTHE BRANCHING as a rule is very slight, the axillary buds of the\r\nmajority of the leaves never attaining development, _e.g._ in the\r\nPalms, bulbous plants and others. As the cotyledon arises singly,\r\nthe succeeding leaves also must be scattered, but they are frequently\r\narranged in two rows (Grasses, Iris, etc). _The first leaf borne on a\r\nbranch_ (the “Fore-leaf,”[24]--the bracteole, if on a floral shoot)\r\nhas generally, in the Monocotyledons, a characteristic form and\r\nposition, being situated on the posterior side of its own shoot, and\r\nhence turned towards the main axis; it is sometimes provided with two\r\nlaterally-placed keels (Figs. 279 _f_, 290 _øi_), but the midrib is\r\noften absent. It arises in some cases from two primordia, which at the\r\nbeginning are quite distinct, and thus has been regarded as formed by\r\ntwo leaves. It is, however, only one leaf, a fact which is evident from\r\nseveral circumstances, one being that it never supports more than one\r\nshoot, and this stands in the median plane (Fig. 279).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 276.--Transverse section of the stem of a\r\n  Palm: _v v_ is the wood portion, _b b_ the bast portion of\r\n  the vascular bundled.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 277.--Diagrammatic representation of the\r\n  course of the vascular bundles, from the stem into the leaves in\r\n  a Monocotyledon.]\r\n\r\nTHE LEAVES are _amplexicaul_, and have a large sheath but no stipules;\r\nthe blade is most frequently long, ligulate, or linear, entire, with\r\nparallel venation, the veins being straight or curved (Figs. 300, 309).\r\nConnecting the large number of veins which run longitudinally, there\r\nare as a rule only weak transverse ones. It is very rarely that other\r\nforms of leaves are found, such as cordate (Figs. 302, 312), or that\r\nthe blade is branched, or the venation is, for example, pinnate or\r\npalmate (Figs. 225, 298); these deviations are especially found in the\r\nAraceæ, the Palms, the Scitamineæ (Fig. 308), the Dioscoreaceæ, and in\r\nseveral aquatic plants. The incisions in the Palm-leaf are derived by\r\nthe splitting of an originally entire leaf.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE FLOWER is generally as follows: Pr3 + 3, A3 + 3,\r\nG3, rarely S3 + P3 with the other members unchanged.[25] Instead of 3,\r\nthe numbers 2 and 4 may occur; rarely others. In all these instances\r\nthere are 5 whorls, which regularly alternate with one another, most\r\nfrequently in the 3-merous flower, as in the diagram (Fig. 278). This\r\ndiagram is found in the following orders: Liliaceæ, Convallariaceæ,\r\nJuncaceæ, Bromeliaceæ, Amaryllidaceæ, Dioscoreaceæ, Palmæ, some\r\nAraceæ, and in some small orders, and may be considered as the typical\r\nstructure and also the starting point for the exceptional orders. The\r\novary in many Monocotyledons has many ovules, and the fruit becomes\r\na many-seeded berry or capsule; this form is no doubt the oldest. In\r\nothers the number of seeds becomes reduced to 1, and the fruit then\r\nbecomes a cypsela, or a drupe (_e.g. Gramineæ_, _Cyperaceæ_, _Palmæ_,\r\netc).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 278.--Diagram of the ordinary, regular flower\r\n  in the Monocotyledons: _s_ is the bract.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 279.--Diagram of _Iris_: _f_ the bracteole;\r\n  in its axil is a shoot with its bracteole.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 280.--Diagram of _Orchis_: _l_ the lip; σ σ\r\n  the two staminodes.]\r\n\r\nDeviations from this typical floral structure in some instances may\r\nbe traced to _suppression_, very rarely to a _splitting_ of certain\r\nmembers, the typical relative positions not being changed. Thus,\r\nthe Iridaceæ, the Cyperaceæ, most of the Gramineæ and some Juncaceæ\r\ndeviate in having only 3 stamens (Fig. 279), the inner whorl (indicated\r\nby *) not becoming developed. The Musaceæ differ in the posterior\r\nstamen not being developed; _Zingiberaceæ_ (Fig. 314), _Marantaceæ_,\r\nand _Cannaceæ_, in the fact that only 1 of all the stamens bears an\r\nanther, and the others are either suppressed or developed into petaloid\r\nstaminodes, with some perhaps cleft in addition. The Orchideæ deviate\r\nin having, generally, only the anterior stamen of all the 6 developed\r\n(Fig. 280). In this, as in other instances, the suppression of certain\r\nparts of the flower is often connected with _zygomorphy_ (_i.e._\r\nsymmetry in _one_ plane), chiefly in the inner perianth-whorl, but also\r\nin the other whorls. In the Orchids, the perianth-leaf (the labellum,\r\nFig. 280 _l_) which is directly opposite the fertile stamen, is larger\r\nand altogether different from the others. The perianth-leaves may also\r\nbe suppressed; see, for example, the two diagrams of the Cyperaceæ\r\n(Fig. 284). In some orders the suppression of these leaves, which form\r\nthe basis of the diagram, is so complete that it is hard to reduce the\r\nactual structure of the flower to the theoretical type, _e.g._ the\r\nGrasses (Fig. 290) and _Lemna_ (Fig. 303). In the first family, which\r\nespecially comprises water-plants, a somewhat different structure is\r\nfound; thus Fig. 282 differs somewhat from the ordinary type, and other\r\nflowers much more so; but the floral diagrams which occur in this\r\nfamily may perhaps be considered as the most probable representatives\r\nof an older type, from which the ordinary pentacyclic forms have taken\r\ntheir origin. In favour of this theory we have the larger number of\r\nwhorls, the spiral arrangement of some of these in the flower, with\r\na large and indefinite number of stamens and carpels, the perfectly\r\napocarpous gynœceum which sometimes occurs, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n   The Monocotyledons are divided into 7 Families:--\r\n\r\n   1. HELOBIEÆ. This family forms a group complete in itself. It\r\n   commences with hypogynous, perfect flowers, whose gynœcium is\r\n   apocarpous and terminates in epigynous and more or less reduced\r\n   forms.\r\n\r\n   2. GLUMIFLORÆ. These have as a starting point the same diagram\r\n   as the following families, but otherwise develope independently.\r\n\r\n   3. SPADICIFLORÆ. Also an independent branch, or perhaps two\r\n   different ones which terminate in much reduced forms.\r\n\r\n   4. ENANTIOBLASTÆ. These ought perhaps to be amalgamated with the\r\n   following family.\r\n\r\n   5. LILIIFLORÆ. These advance from forms with the typical diagram\r\n   and hypogynous flower, to epigynous and reduced forms.\r\n\r\n   6. SCITAMINEÆ and\r\n\r\n   7. GYNANDRÆ. Two isolated families, which probably have taken\r\n   their origin from Liliifloræ, and have epigynous, mostly\r\n   zygomorphic, and much reduced forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Family 1. =Helobieæ.=\r\n\r\nTo this family belong _only water- or marsh-plants_; _the endosperm is\r\nwanting_, and they possess an embryo with a very _large hypocotyl_\r\nprolonged downwards and often club-like. The perianth is often\r\ndifferentiated into calyx and corolla; the flower is regular, and in\r\nthe first orders to be considered, may be reduced to the ordinary\r\nMonocotyledonous type; there are, however, _usually found two_\r\n3-_merous whorls of carpels_ (Fig. 282), and thus in all 6 whorls, or\r\nagain, the _number of carpels may be indefinite_; the number of stamens\r\nalso may be increased, either by the division of the members of a\r\nwhorl, or by the development of additional whorls. _Syncarps_,[26] with\r\nnut or follicular fruitlets, are _very common_, for example, in the\r\nfirst orders; in the last (Hydrocharitaceæ) the carpels are not only\r\nunited, but the ovary is even inferior.\r\n\r\n   The primitive type appears to be a hypogynous flower, similar\r\n   to that of the Juncaginaceæ or Alismaceæ, with several 3-merous\r\n   whorls, and free carpels, each with many ovules; the green\r\n   perianth in this instance being no doubt older than the coloured\r\n   ones. If we take a flower with this structure as the starting\r\n   point, then the family developes partly into epigynous forms,\r\n   partly into others which are so strongly reduced and exceptional\r\n   that it is scarcely possible to refer them to the ordinary\r\n   type. The family, through the peculiar _Zostereæ_, appears to\r\n   approach the Araceæ, in which _Potamogetonaceæ_ and _Najadaceæ_\r\n   are included by some authorities. However, the inclusion of\r\n   _Potamogeton_, and with it _Ruppia_ and _Zannichellia_, in the\r\n   Juncaginaceæ appears quite correct. It would scarcely be right\r\n   to separate _Zostereæ_ from these. Great stress has often been\r\n   laid upon the similarity with the Ranunculaceæ which is found\r\n   in the Alismaceæ, but it is scarcely more than an analogous\r\n   resemblance.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Juncaginaceæ.= The ☿, regular, _hypogynous_ flowers have\r\nthe _perianth_ 3 + 3, _sepaloid_, stamens 3 + 3 (with extrorse\r\nanthers), and carpels 3 + 3 (free or united), of which last, however,\r\none whorl may be suppressed (in _Triglochin maritima_ all 6 carpels\r\nare developed, in _T. palustris_ the inner whorl is unfertile).\r\nInflorescence long spikes. Embryo _straight_.--Marsh-plants with\r\nradical, rush-like leaves, arranged in two rows, and often sheathing\r\nand ligulate (“squamulæ intravaginales”); the inflorescence is a spike\r\nor raceme.--_Scheuchzeria._ Carpels almost free; in each at least two\r\novules. Follicles.--_Triglochin_ has long, fine racemes without bracts\r\nor bracteoles; one ovule in each carpel. The carpels in the two native\r\nspecies are united, but separate when ripe as a schizocarp, loosening\r\nfrom below; they open along the ventral suture or remain closed; a\r\nlinear central column remains. ~The most reduced is Lilæa (1–2 sp.\r\nAm.)--Protogynous. About 10 species. Temp. Fossils in Tertiary.~\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Potamogetonaceæ.= The aquatic plants belonging to this order\r\nare perennial, living entirely submerged, or with floating leaves, and\r\npreferring still water. The leaves are alternate, in some linear and\r\ngrass-like, in others there is an elliptical floating blade, supported\r\nby a linear submerged petiole. Axillary scales. The fruit is generally\r\na syncarp with _nuts_ or _drupes_; the _embryo is curved_, of very\r\nvarious forms.\r\n\r\n_Potamogeton_ (Pond-weed). The rhizome is creeping, sympodial (with two\r\ninternodes in each shoot-generation); the inflorescence is a terminal,\r\nmany-flowered spike, without floral-leaves; below it are found 2\r\nfoliage-leaves placed nearly at the same height, from whose axils\r\nthe branching is continued cymosely. The flowers are ☿, 4-_merous_,\r\nnaked, and consist only of 4 _stamens_, with the _connectives, broadly\r\ndeveloped_ at the back of the anthers, _resembling a perianth_,\r\nand of 4 _free, sessile carpels_. They are common plants in fresh\r\nwater. ~The spike, during the flowering, is raised above the water.\r\nWind-pollinated and protogynous.--Closely allied is _Ruppia_ (Tassel\r\nPond-weed), in salt or brackish water. The spike has only two naked\r\nflowers, each consisting of 2 stamens and 4 carpels. The stalks of the\r\nindividual carpels are considerably prolonged.--_Zannichellia_ (Horned\r\nPond-weed) is monœcious; the ♀-flower consists of 4 (2–9) carpels, with\r\nmembranous, bell-shaped perianth; long styles; the ♂-flower has 1 (-2)\r\nstamens. _Althenia._~\r\n\r\n_Zostera_ (Grass-wrack) is an entirely submerged, marine plant\r\nwith creeping rhizome (with displacement of buds) and strap-shaped\r\nleaves. The flowering shoots are sympodia with displacement of the\r\naxes (Fig. 281). The inflorescence is a peculiar, flatly-compressed\r\nspike, on _one_ side of which the flowers are borne (Fig. 281). ~This\r\ninflorescence may be considered, no doubt correctly, to be derived\r\nfrom the symmetrical spike of _Potamogeton_ by strongly dorsiventral\r\ndevelopment, and by a strong suppression of the floral parts taking\r\nplace simultaneously. Two rows of flowers are developed, but of these\r\none is so pressed into the other that apparently only one is present.~\r\nEach flower consists of only 1 stamen and 1 carpel situated at the same\r\nheight (Fig. 281); the unilocular ovary encloses 1 pendulous ovule\r\nand bears a bifid style. As regards the perianth (?) one leaf may be\r\npresent (_Z. nana_, Fig. 281 _D_). The pollen-grains are filamentous.\r\nPollination takes place under water. ~_Posidonia_ and _Cymodocea_ are\r\nallied to these. About 70 species.~\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 281.--_Zostera._ A Diagram of the\r\n  branching of the floral shoots: _I_, _II_ ... are the successive\r\n  shoot-generations, every other one being shaded; _g_{1}_\r\n  _g_{2}_ ... fore-leaves; _sp_{1} sp_{2}_ ... spathes for the\r\n  successive spikes. Each shoot is united for some distance with\r\n  the parent axis (indicated by the half-shaded internodes). Each\r\n  shoot commences with a fore-leaf turning towards the parent\r\n  axis, _g_; succeeding this is the spathe, _sp_; and then the\r\n  inflorescence. The fore-leaf supports a new lateral shoot.\r\n  _B_ Diagram of a shoot, _II_, which is borne laterally in the\r\n  axil of the fore-leaf _g_{1}_, on the shoot _I_, _g_{2}_ its\r\n  fore-leaf; _sp_{2}_ its spathe; _sti_ squamulæ intravaginales.\r\n  _II_ Is the spadix with stamens and carpels; _b_ a perianth-leaf\r\n  (or connective expansion, similar to those which occur in\r\n  _Potamogeton_). _C_ The upper portion of a young spadix with\r\n  development of flowers. _D_ Part of a spadix with 2 flowers; the\r\n  parts which theoretically belong to one another are connected by\r\n  a dotted line.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Aponogetonaceæ.= Aquatic plants with tuberous stem. They\r\nhave a single, petaloid perianth (3–2–1–leaved), most frequently 6\r\nstamens and 3(-6) carpels. Straight embryo.--About 15 species (Africa,\r\nMadagascar, Tropical Asia and Australia).--_Aponogeton distachyos_ and\r\n_A._ (_Ouvirandra_) _fenestralis_ are grown in conservatories; the\r\nlatter has lattice-like, perforated leaves.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Najadaceæ.= Only one genus _Najas_ (about 10 species);\r\nannual fresh water plants with leaves in pairs and solitary, unisexual\r\nflowers. The ♂ flower is remarkable in having a terminal stamen, which\r\nhas either 4 longitudinal loculi or 1 central one; on this account the\r\nstamen of _Najas_ is considered by some authorities to be a stem and\r\nnot a leaf-structure. The unilocular gynœceum and the single, erect,\r\nanatropous ovule are also terminal. Pollination takes place under the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Alismaceæ.= The regular, _hypogynous_ flowers are in some\r\nspecies unisexual by the suppression of either andrœcium or gynœceum;\r\nthey have a 6-merous perianth, _generally_ differentiated into 3\r\nsepals and 3 petals; generally 6 _stamens in the outer whorl_ (by the\r\ndivision of the 3; Fig. 282) and often several 3-merous whorls inside\r\nthese, and 6–∞ _free_ carpels arranged cyclically or spirally. Fruit a\r\nsyncarp.--Marsh- or water-plants with radical leaves and long-stalked\r\ninflorescences.\r\n\r\n=A.= _Butomeæ. Follicles with many seeds, which are borne on\r\nnearly the whole of the inner surface of the cyclic carpels_ (as in\r\nNymphæaceæ). Embryo _straight_.--_Butomus_ (Flowering Rush, Fig.\r\n282), has an umbel (generally composed of 3 helicoid cymes). _S_\r\n3, _P_ 3, stamens 9 (6 + 3, _i.e._ the outer whorl doubled), _G_ 3\r\n+ 3. ~_B. umbellatus_; creeping rhizome with triangular Iris-like\r\nleaves.--_Hydrocleis. Limnocharis._~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 282.--Diagram of _Butomus_: _f_ bracteole.]\r\n\r\n=B.= _Alismeæ._ Fruit achenes. Latex common (in the intercellular\r\nspaces). The flowers are arranged most frequently in single or\r\ncompound whorls. Embryo _curved_, horse-shoe shaped.--_Alisma_ has\r\n_S_ 3, _P_ 3, _A_ 6 (in 1 whorl, grouped in pairs, _i.e._ doubled in\r\nfront of the sepals), and 1 _whorl_ of 1-seeded achenes on a flat\r\nreceptacle. The leaves are most frequently radicle, long-stalked;\r\nthe lamina have curved longitudinal veins, and a richly branched\r\nvenation. _A. plantago._--_Elisma_ (_E. natans_) has epitropous\r\n(turned inwards) ovules, whilst the ovules of _Alisma_, _Sagittaria_\r\nand others are apotropous (turned outwards).--_Echinodorus_ (_E.\r\nranunculoides_) has a convex receptacle, carpels many, united and\r\ncapitate. _Damasonium_.--_Sagittaria_ (Arrow-head) has _monœcious_\r\nflowers, several whorls of stamens and _spirally-arranged achenes_ on\r\na very convex receptacle. ~_S. sagittifolia_ reproduces by tuberous\r\nbuds formed at the end of long, submerged branches. The leaves, in deep\r\nand rapidly running water, are long and strap-shaped, but in the air\r\narrow-shaped.~\r\n\r\n   Honey is secreted in the flower and pollination effected\r\n   by insects. _Alisma plantago_ has 12 nectaries. The\r\n   submerged flowers of _Elisma natans_ remain closed and are\r\n   self-pollinated. _Butomus_ has protandrous flowers. There are\r\n   about 50 species, which mostly grow outside the Tropics.--Uses\r\n   insignificant. The rhizome of some is farinaceous.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Hydrocharitaceæ.= This order differs chiefly from the\r\npreceding in its _epigynous_ flowers. These are in general unisexual\r\n(_diœcious_), and surrounded by a 2-leaved or bipartite _spathe_; they\r\nare 3-merous in all whorls, but the number of whorls is generally\r\ngreater than 5, sometimes even indefinite. The perianth is divided\r\ninto _calyx_ and _corolla_. The ovary is _unilocular_ with parietal\r\nplacentation, or more or less incompletely plurilocular. The fruit\r\nis berry-like, but usually ruptures irregularly when ripe. Embryo\r\nstraight.--Most often submerged water-plants, leaves seldom floating on\r\nthe surface. Axillary scales (_squamulæ intravaginales_).\r\n\r\n_Hydrocharis._ Floating water-plants with round cordate leaves; S3, P3\r\n(folded in the bud); ♂-flowers: 3 (-more) flowers inside each spathe;\r\nstamens 9–15, the most internal sterile. ♀-flowers solitary; three\r\nstaminodes; ovary 6-locular, with many ovules attached to the septa;\r\nstyles 6, short, bifid. [The petals of the ♀-flowers bear nectaries at\r\nthe base. In this and the following genus the pollination is without\r\ndoubt effected by insects.] ~_H. morsus ranæ_ (Frog-bit) has runners;\r\nit hibernates by means of special winter-buds.~--_Stratiotes_; floating\r\nplants with a rosette of linear, thick, stiff leaves with spiny margin,\r\nspringing from a short stem, from which numerous roots descend into\r\nthe mud. Inflorescence, perianth, and ovary nearly the same as in\r\n_Hydrocharis_, but the ♂-flower has 12 stamens in 3 whorls, of which\r\nthe outer 6 are in 1 whorl (dédoublement), and inside the perianth in\r\nboth flowers there are numerous (15–30) nectaries (staminodes?). _S.\r\naloides_ (Water-soldier); in N. Eur. only ♀-plants.--~_Vallisneria\r\nspiralis_ is a tropical or sub-tropical plant, growing gregariously\r\non the mud in fresh water. The leaves are grass-like, and the plants\r\ndiœcious; the ♂-flowers are detached from the plant, and rise to\r\nthe surface of the water, where they pollinate the ♀-flowers. These\r\nare borne on long, spirally-twisted peduncles which contract after\r\npollination, so that the ♀-flower is again drawn under the water,\r\nand the fruits ripen deeply submerged.--_Elodea canadensis_ is also\r\nan entirely submerged plant. The leaves are arranged in whorls on a\r\nwell-developed stem. Only ♀-plants in Europe (introduced about 1836\r\nfrom N. Am). This plant spreads with great rapidity throughout the\r\ncountry, the reproduction being entirely vegetative. _Hydrilla_,\r\n_Halophila_, _Thalassia_, _Enhalus_.--In many of these genera the\r\nnumber of whorls in the flower is remarkably reduced; for example, in\r\n_Vallisneria_, in the ♂-flowers to 2: Pr 3, A (1-) 3, in the ♀ to 3: Pr\r\n3, Staminodes 3, G 3.--About 40 species; Temp. and Trop.~\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 2. =Glumifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe _hypogynous_ flowers in the Juncaceæ are completely developed on\r\nthe _pentacyclic, trimerous_ type, with _dry, scarious perianth_.\r\nEven in these the interior whorl of stamens becomes suppressed, and\r\nthe ovary, which in _Juncus_ is trilocular with many ovules, becomes\r\nin _Luzula_ almost unilocular, but still with 3 ovules. The perianth\r\nin the Cyperaceæ and Gramineæ is reduced from hairs, in the first of\r\nthese, to nothing, the flowers at the same time collecting more closely\r\non the inflorescence (spike) supported by _dry_ bracts (_chaff_); the\r\nnumber of stamens is almost constantly 3; stigmas linear; the ovary\r\nhas only 1 loculus with 1 ovule, and the fruit, which is a capsule in\r\nthe Juncaceæ, becomes a nut or caryopsis.--The endosperm is large and\r\nfloury, the embryo being placed at its lower extremity (Figs. 286 _B_,\r\n291).--The plants belonging to this order, with the exception of a few\r\ntropical species, are annual or perennial herbs. The stems above ground\r\nare thin, and for the most part have long internodes, with linear,\r\nparallel-veined leaves which have long _sheaths_, and often a _ligule_,\r\n_i.e._ a membranous projection, arising transversely from the leaf at\r\nthe junction of the sheath and blade. The underground stems are short\r\nor creeping rhizomes. The flowers are small and insignificant. Wind- or\r\nself-pollination.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Juncaceæ= (=Rushes=). The regular, hermaphrodite, hypogynous\r\nflowers have 3 + 3 brown, dry, free perianth-leaves projecting like\r\na star during the opening of the flower; stamens 3 + 3 (seldom 3 +\r\n0) and 3 carpels united into one gynœceum (Fig. 283); the ovary is\r\n3- or 1-locular; there is as a rule 1 style, which becomes divided\r\nat the summit into 3 stigmas, often bearing branches twisted to the\r\nright (Fig. 283). _Fruit a capsule_ with loculicidal dehiscence. The\r\nembryo is an extremely small, ellipsoidal, cellular mass, without\r\ndifferentiation into the external organs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 283.--Flower of _Luzula_.]\r\n\r\n_Juncus_ (Rush) has glabrous foliage-leaves, generally cylindrical,\r\nrarely flat; the edges of the leaf-sheath are free (“_open_”\r\nleaf-sheaths) and cover one another. The capsule, 1- or 3-locular, with\r\n_many_ seeds--_Luzula_ (Wood-Rush) has flat, grass-like leaves with\r\nciliated edges; the edges of the leaf-sheath are united (“_closed_”\r\nleaf-sheath). The capsule unilocular and _3-seeded_.--_Prionium_: S.\r\nAfrica; resembling a _Tacona_.\r\n\r\n   The _interior_ whorl of stamens, in some species, disappears\r\n   partially or entirely (_J. supinus_, _capitatus_,\r\n   _conglomerates_, etc.)\r\n\r\n   Some of the numerous _Juncus_-species (_e.g. J. effusus_,\r\n   _glaucus_, _conglomeratus_, etc.), have false, lateral\r\n   inflorescences, the axis of the inflorescence being pushed\r\n   to one side by its subtending leaf, which apparently forms\r\n   a direct continuation of the stem, and resembles it both\r\n   in external and internal structure. The foliage-leaves of\r\n   this genus were formerly described as “unfertile stems,”\r\n   because they are cylindrical, erect, and resemble stems, and\r\n   consequently the stem was said to be “leafless”: _J. effusus_,\r\n   _glaucus_, _conglomeratus_. Stellate parenchynatous cells are\r\n   found in the pith of these stems and in the leaves. Other\r\n   species have distinct terminal inflorescences and grooved\r\n   leaves; _J. bufonius_ (Toad-rush), _compressus_, and others.\r\n   The _inflorescences_ most often present the peculiarity of\r\n   having the lateral axes protruding above the main axis.\r\n   Their composition is as follows:--The flowers have either no\r\n   bracteoles, and the inflorescences are then capitulate; or\r\n   they have 1–several bracteoles. Each branch has then, first,\r\n   a 2-keeled fore-leaf placed posteriorly (“basal-leaf”), and\r\n   succeeding this are generally several leaves borne alternately\r\n   and in the same plane as the basal-leaf, the two uppermost\r\n   (the “spathe-leaves”) being always barren; those which lie\r\n   between the basal-leaves and the spathe-leaves are termed\r\n   “intermediate-leaves.” If only branches occur in the axils\r\n   of the basal-leaves, then the succeeding branches are always\r\n   borne on the posterior side of the axis, and form a fan[27];\r\n   if the basal-leaf is barren, and if there is only one fertile\r\n   intermediate-leaf, then the lateral axes are always on the upper\r\n   side, and a sickle[27]-like inflorescence occurs; if there are 2\r\n   fertile intermediate-leaves, then a dichasium is formed, and in\r\n   the case of there being several, then a raceme, or spike.\r\n\r\n   _Juncaceæ_ are, by several authors, classed among the\r\n   Liliifloræ, but there are so many morphological and partly\r\n   anatomical features agreeing with the two following orders, that\r\n   they may, no doubt, most properly be regarded as the starting\r\n   point of these, especially of the _Cyperaceæ_, which they\r\n   resemble in the type of flowers, the inflorescence, the type of\r\n   mechanical system, and the stomata.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION by means of the wind. Cross-pollination is\r\n   often established by protogyny. _J. bufonius_ has partly\r\n   triandrous and cleistogamic, partly hexandrous, open\r\n   flowers.--DISTRIBUTION. The 200 species are spread over the\r\n   entire globe, but especially in cold and temperate countries;\r\n   they are seldom found in the Tropics.--USES. Very slight;\r\n   plaiting, for instance.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Cyperaceæ.= The majority are _perennial_ (seldom annual)\r\n_herbs_ living in damp situations, with a sympodial rhizome and\r\ngrass-like appearance. The stems are seldom hollow, or have swollen\r\nnodes, but generally _triangular_, with the upper internode just below\r\nthe inflorescence generally very long. The leaves are often arranged\r\nin 3 _rows_, the leaf-sheath is _closed_ (very seldom split), and the\r\nligule is absent or insignificant. The flowers are arranged in _spikes_\r\n(_spikelets_) which may be united into other forms of inflorescences\r\n(chiefly spikes or racemes). The flowers are supported by a bract,\r\nbut have _no bracteoles_. In some genera the perianth is distinctly\r\nrepresented by six bristles corresponding to six leaves (Figs. 284\r\n_A_, 286 _A_); in others it is represented by an indefinite number of\r\nhairs (Fig. 284 _B_), and very frequently it is altogether wanting.\r\n_The inner whorl of stamens is absent_, and the flower has therefore\r\n3 stamens (rarely more or less than 3), the anthers _are attached by\r\ntheir bases to the filament_ (innate) and are not bifid (Figs. 286).\r\nGynœceum simple, formed of 3 or 2 carpels; 1 style, which is divided\r\nat the extremity, as in the Juncaceæ, into 3 or 2 arms; the single\r\nloculus of the ovary contains one basal, erect, anatropous ovule; the\r\nstigmas are not feather-like. _Fruit a nut_, whose seed is generally\r\nnot united with the pericarp. The embryo is small, and lies at the\r\n_base of the seed in the central line_, surrounded on the inner side by\r\nthe endosperm (Fig. 286 _B_). On germination the cotyledon _does not\r\nremain_ in the seed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 284.--Diagram of structure of: _A Scirpus\r\n  silvaticus_; _B Eriophorum angustifolium_.]\r\n\r\n   A regular perianth, with 6 scale-like perianth-leaves in 2\r\n   whorls, is found in _Oreobolus_. In _Scirpus littoralis_ the\r\n   perianth-leaves are spreading at the apex, and divided pinnately.\r\n\r\n   The branching of the inflorescence is often the same as in the\r\n   Juncaceæ, and supports the theory that these two orders are\r\n   related. In _Rhynchospora_ and others, the “spikelets” are\r\n   really only “spike-like” and to some extent compound.\r\n\r\n=A.= SCIRPEÆ. HERMAPHRODITE FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n1. Spikelets cylindrical, the bracts arranged spirally (in many\r\nrows). The lower ones are often barren, each of the others supports\r\na flower.--_Scirpus_ (Club-rush). The spikelets are many-flowered;\r\nthe perianth is bristle-like or absent, and does not continue to grow\r\nduring the ripening of the fruit (Fig. 286 _A_). Closely allied to this\r\nis _Heleocharis_, with terminal spikes.--_Eriophorum_ (Cotton-grass)\r\ndiffers chiefly in having the perianth-hairs prolonged, and forming a\r\nbunch of white, woolly hairs (Fig. 284 _B_).\r\n\r\n   _Cladium_ and _Rhynchospora_ (Beak-rush) differs especially in\r\n   the _few_-flowered, compound spikelets which are collected into\r\n   small bunches; the latter has received its name from the fact\r\n   that the lowermost portion of the style remains attached to the\r\n   fruit as a beak.\r\n\r\n2. Spikelets compressed, the bracts arranged only in _two rows_; the\r\nother characters as in the first-mentioned. _Cyperus_ (spikelets\r\nmany-flowered); _Schœnus_ (Bog-rush); spikelets few-flowered; _S.\r\nnigricans_ has an open sheath.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 285.--_Carex_: _A_ diagram of a male flower;\r\n  _B_ of a female flower with 3 stigmas; _C_ of a female flower\r\n  with 2 stigmas; _D_ diagrammatic figure of a female flower; _E_\r\n  similar one of the androgynous (false) spikelet of _Elyna_.

UNISEXUAL FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nIn the ♂-flowers there is no trace of a carpel, and in the ♀ no trace\r\nof a stamen. Floral-leaves in many rows. In some (_Scleria_, certain\r\n_Carex_-species), ♂-and ♀-flowers are borne in the same spikelet, the\r\nlatter at the base or the reverse; in the majority each spikelet is\r\nunisexual.\r\n\r\n_Carex_ (Fig. 285) has _naked_, most frequently monœcious flowers.\r\nThe ♂-_spikes_, which are generally placed at the summit of the whole\r\ncompound inflorescence, are _not compound_; in the axil of each\r\nfloral-leaf (bract) _a flower is borne, consisting only_ of a short\r\naxis with three stamens (Fig. 285 _A_). The ♀-_spikes are compound_;\r\nin the axil of each floral-leaf is borne a very small branch (Fig. 285\r\n_D_, _a_) which _bears only one leaf_, namely, a _2-keeled fore-leaf_\r\n(_utriculus_, _utr._ in the figures) which is turned posteriorly (as\r\nthe fore-leaves of the other Monocotyledons), and being obliquely\r\nsheath-like, envelopes the branch (in the same manner as the sheath\r\nof the vegetative leaves), and forms a pitcher-like body. In the axil\r\nof _this_ leaf the ♀-flower is situated as a branch of the 3rd order,\r\nbearing only the 2–3 carpels, which are united into one gynœceum.\r\nThe style protrudes through the mouth of the utriculus. ~The axis\r\nof the 2nd order (_a_ in Fig. 285 _D_) may sometimes elongate as a\r\nbristle-like projection (normally in _Uncinia_, in which it ends as a\r\nhook, hence the name); this projection is in most cases barren, but it\r\nsometimes bears 1–several bracts which support male-flowers; this is\r\nnormal in _Elyna_ (or _Kobresia_) and _Schœnoxiphium_; the axis (_a_ in\r\n285 _E_) bears at its base a female-flower supported by the utriculus,\r\nand above it a male-flower supported by its bract.~\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION by means of the wind. Protogynous. Sometimes\r\n   self-pollinated. The order embraces nearly 3,000 species, found\r\n   all over the world. _Carex_ and _Scirpus_ are most numerous in\r\n   cold and temperate climates, and become less numerous towards\r\n   the equator. The reverse is the case with _Cyperus_ and other\r\n   tropical genera. They generally confine themselves to sour,\r\n   swampy districts; some, on the other hand, are characteristic\r\n   of sand-dunes, such as Sand-star (_Carex arenaria_). There are\r\n   about 70 native species of _Carex_.\r\n\r\n   USES. In spite of their large number, the Cyperaceæ are of\r\n   no importance as fodder-grasses, as they are dry and contain\r\n   a large amount of silica; hence the edges of many of the\r\n   triangular stems or leaves are exceedingly sharp and cutting.\r\n   _Cyperus esculentus_ has tuberous rhizomes, which contain a\r\n   large amount of fatty oil and are edible (earth-almonds); it\r\n   has its home in the countries of the Mediterranean, where it is\r\n   cultivated.\r\n\r\n   _Cyperus papyrus_ (W. Asia, Egypt, Sicily) attains a height of\r\n   several metres, and has stems of the thickness of an arm which\r\n   were used by the ancient Egyptians for making paper (papyrus).\r\n   Some serve for plaiting, mats, etc. (_Scirpus lacustris_, etc.).\r\n   _Isolepis_ is an ornamental plant.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 287.--_Triticum_: _A_ axis (rachis) of ear\r\n  showing the notches where the spikelets were inserted; _B_ an\r\n  entire spikelet; _C_ a flower with the pales; _D_ a flower\r\n  without the pales, showing the lodicules at the base; _E_ glume;\r\n  _F_ outer pale; _G_ inner pale; _H_ fruit; _I_ longitudinal\r\n  section of fruit.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Gramineæ= (=Grasses=). The stems are cylindrical, generally\r\n_hollow_ with _swollen nodes_, that is, a swelling is found at the base\r\nof each leaf which apparently belongs to the stem, but in reality it\r\nis the swollen base of the leaf. The leaves are _exactly alternate_;\r\nthe sheath is _split_ (excep. _Bromus_-species, _Poa pratensis_, _P.\r\ntrivialis_, _Melica_, _Dactylis_, etc., in which the sheath is not\r\nsplit), and the edges overlap alternately, the right over the left,\r\nand _vice versâ_; the _ligule_ is nearly always well developed. In\r\ngeneral, the flowers are hermaphrodite; they are borne in _spikelets_\r\nwith _alternate floral-leaves_, and the spikelets themselves are\r\nborne in either _spikes_ or _panicles_. The two (seldom more) _lowest\r\nfloral-leaves_ in each spikelet (Fig. 289 _øY_, _nY_) are _barren_ (as\r\nthe covering-leaves in many umbels and capitula); these are termed\r\nthe _glumes_. The succeeding floral-leaves, each of which supports\r\none flower as its bract, are called the _outer pales_ (_nI_); these\r\nsometimes each bear an “awn” (a bristle-like body which projects in\r\nthe median line either from the apex or the back); sometimes the\r\nupper ones are barren. Each flower has a _bracteole_, which is placed\r\non the inside opposite the main axis; it is thin, _binerved_ or\r\n_two-keeled_, and never has an awn; it is known as the _inner pale_\r\n(_øI_). Immediately succeeding the bracteole are: (_a_) some _small,\r\ndelicate scales_ (_lodicules_, Figs. 287 _D_, 288 _C_, 290 _L_); (_b_)\r\n_three stamens_ with anthers _versatile_, so as to be easily moved,\r\nand usually notched at each end (Fig. 287 _C_); and (_c_) a simple\r\ngynœceum formed of _one carpel_ with _two styles_ having generally\r\n_spirally-branched stigmas_ (Figs. 287 _D_, 288 _C_). The ovary is\r\n_unilocular_, and contains one ascending or pendulous, anatropous\r\novule. _Fruit a nut_, whose seed is always _firmly united with the thin\r\npericarp_ (“caryopsis”). The embryo is larger than in the Cyperaceæ and\r\nis placed at the base of the seed, but on the _outer convex surface_\r\nof the pericarp (Figs. 287 _I_, 288 288 _D_, 291), _outside the\r\nendosperm_; plumule large with several leaf-primordia. On germination\r\nthe cotyledon remains in the seed.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Grasses are annual or perennial herbs; tree-like forms\r\nbeing only found in the Tropics, for example, the Bamboos; they branch\r\n(in tufts), especially from the axils of the basal-leaves, while those\r\nwhich are borne higher on the stem are separated by longer internodes\r\nand have no vegetative branches in their axils, though a few forms,\r\nlike _Bambusa_ and _Calamagrostis lanceolata_, produce branches in\r\nthese axils.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 288.--_Bromus mollis_: _A_ inflorescence; _B_\r\n  the uppermost flower of a spikelet, with its axis turned forward;\r\n  in front is seen the two-keeled inner pale (bracteole) and the\r\n  stamens protrude between this and the outer pale (bract); _C_ an\r\n  ovary with the 2 stigmas on its anterior side, the 2 lodicules,\r\n  and the 3 stamens; _D_ the fruit seen from the dorsal side; _E_\r\n  the same from the ventral side.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 289.--Diagrammatic outline of a spikelet: _n\r\n  Y_ lower glume; _ø Y_ upper glume; _n I_ upper pale; _ø I_ the\r\n  inner pale; _l_-_l_ lodicules; _st_ stamens; _I_-_I_ main axes;\r\n  _II_ lateral axes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 290.--Diagram of the Grass-flower: _ni_ outer\r\n  pale; _øi_ inner pale; _l_-_l_ lodicules.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 291.--Longitudinal section of an Oat-grain:\r\n  _a_ the skin (pericarp and testa); _b_ the endosperm; _c_ the\r\n  cotyledon; _d_ the plumule.]\r\n\r\n   Only a few Grasses have a _solid stem_, such as Maize,\r\n   Sugar-cane, and _Andropogon_. The _blade_ is flat in the\r\n   meadow-grasses, but the Grasses which live on dry places\r\n   (“prairie-grass”) exposed to the sun, often have the blade\r\n   tightly rolled up and almost filiform or bristle-like, with\r\n   anomalous anatomical structure. A _closed_ tubular _sheath_ is\r\n   found in _Melica uniflora_, _Bromus_-species, _Poa pratensis_\r\n   and _trivialis_, _Briza_ and some _Glyceria_-species. The\r\n   sheath is developed for the purpose of supporting the young\r\n   internodes while their growth is proceeding at the base. The\r\n   “nodes” (the swollen joints which are seen on stems of Grasses)\r\n   are not really part of the stem but are formed by the base of\r\n   the leaf-sheath. They play a part in assisting the haulms\r\n   to regain a vertical position when laid prostrate by wind\r\n   or rain. The _awn_ on the pale is homologous with the blade\r\n   of the Grass-leaf, and the pale itself is the sheath. The\r\n   arrangement of the leaves in the _spikelet_ is similar to that\r\n   in _Cyperus_ and other Cyperaceæ, their floral-leaves being\r\n   borne in several rows in _Streptochæta_. More than two barren\r\n   “glumes” are found in _Streptochæta_, several Phalarideæ and\r\n   others. The spikelets, too, are again arranged in two rows in\r\n   the axils of suppressed floral-leaves. The inflorescence becomes\r\n   a “compound spike” (ear) when the spikelets are sessile. In the\r\n   majority of instances the spikelets are borne on long stalks;\r\n   when these branch, then the secondary branches, and similarly\r\n   all branches of higher order, are placed so far down upon the\r\n   mother-axis that they all appear to be of equal value and to\r\n   arise in a semicircle from the mother-axis itself, though in\r\n   reality they arise from each other (_Panicle_, Fig. 288 _A_).\r\n   Sometimes the main axis and branches of different orders unite\r\n   together as in _Alopecurus_, _Phleum_, and some other Grasses,\r\n   and hence the single (short-stalked) spikelets appear to arise\r\n   singly and spirally, or without any definite order, directly\r\n   from the main axis, with the production of a _cylindrical_\r\n   inflorescence bearing “spikes” _on all sides_, that is, a\r\n   “_spike-like panicle_.”--Many inflorescences are somewhat\r\n   dorsiventral. The _flower_ is rarely unisexual (_Zea mais_) or\r\n   barren. Considerable difficulty is experienced in reducing the\r\n   Grass-flower to the ordinary 3-merous Monocotyledonous type.\r\n   Some authorities consider the _lodicules_, which are present\r\n   in all Grasses but absent in the Cyperaceæ, to be homologous\r\n   with a perianth. According to a more recent theory they are\r\n   bracteoles, and hence the Gramineæ, like many of the Juncaceæ,\r\n   have 2–3 bracteoles placed in two rows in the median plane. If\r\n   this theory be correct, the _flower is naked_. The lodicules\r\n   expand quickly and cause the opening of the flower (_i.e._ the\r\n   two pales become separated from each other). Generally only 3\r\n   _stamens_ belonging to the outer whorl are present (Fig. 290),\r\n   as in _Iris_ (Fig. 279), certain Juncaceæ and Cyperaceæ (Fig.\r\n   284), but in some, such as the Rice and certain species of\r\n   Bamboos, all 6 are found. _Pariana_ has more than 6. Only 1 of\r\n   the _carpels_ is present, namely, the anterior (of those in Fig.\r\n   284), so that the ventral suture and the place of attachment\r\n   of the ovule are situated at the back of the ovary. The number\r\n   of styles does not correspond with the number of carpels, and\r\n   the styles may therefore be supposed to arise from the edges\r\n   of the leaf to the right and left--a position which is not\r\n   without analogy. In addition, a stylar projection is sometimes\r\n   found on the anterior side and in the median line (_e.g._ in\r\n   _Phragmites_), and the solitary style in _Nardus_ has exactly\r\n   this position; a similar arrangement is found in some species of\r\n   _Bambusa_ which have only one style; other species of _Bambusa_\r\n   have three styles. A tripartite style is found in _Pharus_.\r\n\r\n   [The Grass-flower may be reduced to the ordinary\r\n   Monocotyledonous type thus:--The outer pale is the bract of the\r\n   flower since it bears in its axil the floral shoot; the inner\r\n   pale occupies the customary position of the bracteole. The fact\r\n   that it is binerved can be explained by its having been pressed\r\n   against the main-axis during development. Similar binerved\r\n   bracteoles are found in _Iris_ (Fig. 279). These bracteoles in\r\n   both Grass and Iris arise from single primordia, and are not\r\n   produced by the coalescence of two leaves. The lodicules are the\r\n   only parts of the perianth remaining, the outer whorl having\r\n   been suppressed, and also the posterior leaf of the inner whorl;\r\n   a posterior lodicule, however, is found in the Rice and some\r\n   species of Bamboo. The outer whorl of stamens is usually absent,\r\n   though this again is present in the Rice and Bamboo. The three\r\n   carpels are reduced to one with two or sometimes three stigmas.]\r\n\r\n   THE FLOWERING. In the panicles the flowers open in basipetal\r\n   order; the flowers in the spikes situated somewhat above the\r\n   middle, commence to open first, and the flowering proceeds\r\n   upwards and downwards. A few Grass-flowers never open\r\n   (cleistogamic); _Leersia oryzoides_, _Stipa_-species, and _e.g._\r\n   Wheat and Rye in cold damp weather; some open their pales so\r\n   wide that the anthers and stigmas may protrude at the top; most\r\n   frequently the lodicules expand and force the pales suddenly\r\n   and widely apart. The filaments elongate considerably, so that\r\n   the anthers are pendulous and the stigmas unfold. In some\r\n   Grasses _e.g._ Wheat, the blooming of each flower only lasts\r\n   a short time. POLLINATION is generally effected by the wind.\r\n   The _Rye_ separates the pales very widely in the morning, and\r\n   allows the anthers and stigmas to appear; it is almost entirely\r\n   sterile when self-pollinated. The _Wheat_ flowers at any time\r\n   of the day, each flower lasting only a quarter of an hour. The\r\n   pales open suddenly, but only half way, and the anthers scatter\r\n   one-third of the pollen in their own flower and two-thirds\r\n   outside. Self-pollination is effectual, but crossing gives\r\n   better results. In _Hordeum vulgare_ (all flowers ☿) the flowers\r\n   of the 4 outer rows behave as in the Wheat, but those in the\r\n   two central rows always remain closed. The ☿-flowers in the\r\n   two central rows of _H. distichum_ remain closed and fertilise\r\n   themselves; they open exceptionally, and may be pollinated\r\n   by the ♂-flowers in the 4 lateral rows. _H. hexastichum_ is\r\n   cleistogamic. _Oats_ pollinate themselves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 292.--Barley grain: _A_ section through the\r\n  skin (_a-d_) and the most external part of the endosperm; _Gl_\r\n  the “aleurone layer”; _st_ starch-containing cells; _B_ starch\r\n  grains.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 293.--Wheat-grain germinating: _g_ the\r\n  plumule; _b_ the first leaf succeeding the cotyledon; _r^1_ the\r\n  primary root; _r^2_ lateral root.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 294.--Older seedling of the Wheat: _s_ the\r\n  second sheathing-leaf; _l_ first foliage-leaf.]\r\n\r\n   _The ripe Grass-fruit_, in some species of Bamboo, is a berry;\r\n   in some other Grasses a nut with _loosely_ lying seed, in some\r\n   even a capsule, but otherwise a “caryopsis.” In some instances\r\n   it is loosely enveloped by the pales (Oat), in others firmly\r\n   attached to these (Barley), and finally, in others, “naked,”\r\n   _i.e._ it is entirely free from the pales (Wheat and Rye).\r\n   On the ventral side there is a groove (Fig. 288 _E_); on the\r\n   anterior side (dorsal suture), which is turned towards the\r\n   inner pale, it is convex, and at the base on this side, inside\r\n   the testa, lies the embryo (Fig. 288 _D_). The apex of the\r\n   fruit is often hairy (Fig. 293). The _skin_ (Fig. 291, _a_) is\r\n   formed by the pericarp and testa, and in some cases (Barley)\r\n   the pales also form the outer portion. The endosperm (_b_) is\r\n   large, and formed of parenchymatous, starch-containing cells:\r\n   aleurone (proteid) grains may also be found among them. When\r\n   the starch-grains and the aleurone-grains adhere together\r\n   the endosperm becomes “horny,” but is “floury” when the\r\n   starch-grains lie loosely with air between them. In the most\r\n   external region, just beneath the skin, 1–several layers of\r\n   nearly cubical cells (filled principally with aleurone-grains\r\n   and fat) are found, the _aleurone_-layer (Fig. 292). The embryo\r\n   (Fig. 291 _c-d_) contains large quantities of fatty oil;\r\n   the large shield-like structure, attached to the embryo and\r\n   turned inwards towards the endosperm (_c_), is the cotyledon\r\n   (scutellum); it remains enclosed in the seed during germination,\r\n   and dissolves the endosperm by means of the peculiar epithelial\r\n   cells developed on the dorsal surface. The radicle, on\r\n   germination, is obliged to perforate a mass of cells derived\r\n   from the suspensor and which form the “root-sheath” (coleorhiza,\r\n   Fig. 293) round its base. In addition to the tap-root, lateral\r\n   roots are frequently developed before germination; these quickly\r\n   break through, and later on are followed by others which appear\r\n   at the base of the leaf (Figs. 293, 294).\r\n\r\n   The DISTRIBUTION OF THE FRUIT is most frequently effected by the\r\n   wind. The spirally-twisted and hygroscopic awn which persists on\r\n   the fruits of some species (_Avena_, _Stipa_, etc.) assists in\r\n   their dissemination, and even helps to bury them in the ground.\r\n\r\n   The two preceding orders are more closely related to each other\r\n   than they are to the Gramineæ.\r\n\r\n   The generic differences are chiefly founded on the form of\r\n   the inflorescence, the number and sex of the flowers in the\r\n   spikelets, the shape and relative length of the pales, awns,\r\n   etc. In addition to these the structure of the fruit and\r\n   seed presents a great many differences; some have compound\r\n   starch-grains, while in others they are single; some have 1\r\n   layer of aleurone-cells, others have several (Fig. 292), etc.\r\n\r\n=1.= BAMBUSEÆ. Tall Grasses with woody, very siliceous stems which bear\r\nmany branches in the axils of the leaves. 6 stamens. _Bambusa_ (Bamboo).\r\n\r\n=2.= ORYZEÆ. _Oryza sativa_ (Rice) is a herbaceous marsh-plant, with\r\npanicle and small, 1-flowered spikelets, with two small glumes and two\r\nlarge, boat-shaped, strongly siliceous pales. 6 stamens.--_Leersia._\r\n_Lygeum. Pharus. Zizania aquatica._\r\n\r\n=3.= MAYDEÆ. _Zea mais_ (Indian-corn, Maize); the spikelets are\r\nunisexual; the ♂-spikelets in a terminal panicle; the ♀-spikelets\r\nclosely crowded and arranged in many rows in a thick, axillary spike,\r\nenclosed by large sheathing-leaves. The ♀-spikelets are 1-(2-)\r\nflowered; the ovary bears one, long, filamentous style, with bifid\r\nstigma.--_Euchlæna_; _Coix_.\r\n\r\n=4.= ANDROPOGONEÆ. _Saccharum_ (Sugar-cane); the spikelets\r\nare exceptionally small, 1-flowered, and borne in pairs in\r\nmany-flowered, long-haired panicles.

Glumes small, in each case shorter than\r\nthe spikelet.--_Festuca_ (Fescue) and _Bromus_ (Brome, Fig. 288)\r\nhave the awn placed at the _apex_ of the pale, or slightly below\r\nit. _Festuca_ has perennial species, with only a sparsely-branched\r\npanicle with branches solitary or in pairs, and round spikelets; the\r\nleaf-sheath is widely open. _Bromus_ has the branches borne in half\r\nwhorls, and the leaf-sheath scarcely half open. _Brachypodium_ has very\r\nshort-stalked spikelets in a raceme.--_Poa_ (Meadow-grass), _Briza_\r\n(Quaking-grass) and _Glyceria_ have awnless spikelets; these in _Poa_\r\nare ovoid, compressed, and with sharply-keeled glumes; in _Briza_ they\r\nare broad, cordate and drooping, with boat-shaped glumes; in _Glyceria_\r\nround, long, many-flowered, linear or lanceolate; some species of\r\n_Glyceria_ have closed leaf-sheaths.--_Dactylis_ (Cock’s-foot) differs\r\nfrom all others in the somewhat crowded and unilateral (subsecund)\r\nspikelets, which are compressed and oblique (_i.e._ one side more\r\nconvex than the other).--_Phragmites_ (_P. communis_, Reed); the\r\nlowermost flowers of the spikelet are ♂; its axis is covered with\r\nlong, silky hairs; pales without awns, but acuminate. Perennial\r\nmarsh-plants.--_Melica_; panicle small, sparsely-branched with\r\nround, awnless, few-flowered, usually drooping spikelets. The upper\r\npales, with arrested flowers, are generally united into a club-like\r\nmass.--_Molinia_, _Eragrostis_, _Koeleria_, _Catabrosa_.--_Cynosurus_\r\n(Dog’s-tail) has a small, spicate panicle with unilateral spikelets,\r\nsome of which are fertile, some barren, each supported by a pectinate\r\nscale. _Arundo.

Panicles or spike-like panicles with 1-flowered\r\nspikelets. Generally 2 glumes and only 1 pale.--The following have\r\nPANICLES: _Milium_ with square panicle-branches and round spikelets;\r\n_Agrostis_ (Fiorin), with compressed, glabrous spikelets, whose glumes\r\nare longer than the pales. _Calamagrostis_ differs in having a chaplet\r\nof long hairs at the base of the pale.--_Stipa_ (Feather-grass) has a\r\nlong, twisted awn.--The following have SPIKELIKE PANICLES: _Phleum_\r\n(Cat’s-tail, Timothy-grass) has sharply pointed, entirely free glumes,\r\nwhich are much longer than the awnless pales. _Alopecurus_ (Fox-tail);\r\nglumes united below; pale with awn. _Ammophila_ (_Psamma_). _A.\r\narundinacea_; pales hairy at base; perennial, stiff-leaved, glaucous\r\nsand-grass with creeping rhizome. _Aristida. Sporobolus._\r\n\r\n=8.= PHALARIDEÆ. Panicles and spike-like panicles. The spikelet has\r\nin the upper part a single fertile flower; below it are placed 4\r\npales, of which the upper 1–2 sometimes support ♂-flowers. On the\r\nwhole, 6 floral-leaves of the first order are present.--_Phalaris_\r\n(_P. canariensis_, Canary-grass) has an ovate, spike-like panicle,\r\nthe spikelets are compressed, convex on the outer side, concave on\r\nthe inner. The large glumes are winged on the back.--_Digraphis_ (_D.\r\narundinacea_) is closely allied to _Phalaris_, but the keel of the\r\nglumes is not winged.--_Anthoxanthum_ (_A. odoratum_, Sweet-vernal) has\r\na small, lanceolate, open, spike-like panicle; the spikelets have below\r\n2 barren flowers, and above these an ☿-flower with 2 stamens. The upper\r\nglume is longer than the flower.--_Hierochloa._\r\n\r\n   =9.= CHLORIDEÆ. The spikelets are arranged in the form of a\r\n   spike in two rows on one side of an often flatly-compressed\r\n   axis; they are mostly 1-flowered.--_Chloris_; _Ctenium_;\r\n   _Cynodon_; _Eleusine_; _Microchloa_.\r\n\r\n   =10.= PANICEÆ. The spikelets are borne in panicles or spikes,\r\n   which may be arranged like fingers or in a raceme. There\r\n   is a centrally-placed ☿-flower; below it is sometimes a\r\n   ♂-flower.--_Panicum_; _Paspalum_; _Oplismenus_; _Setaria_ has\r\n   an almost cylindrical spike-like panicle with several barren\r\n   branchlets, which project as stiff, rough bristles.--_Cenchrus_;\r\n   _Pennisetum_.\r\n\r\n=11.= HORDEÆ. Spikes compound; spikelets sessile in the\r\nnotches of a toothed axis.\r\n\r\n=A.= Spikelets solitary.--_Triticum_ (Wheat, Fig. 287) has in each\r\ntooth of the main axis, a several-flowered spikelet which turns its\r\n_flat side_ towards the central axis. The cultivated species (true\r\nWheat) are 1-2-annual, the wild ones (_T. repens_, Couch, also as an\r\nindependent genus, _Agropyrum_) are perennial, with creeping rhizome\r\nand lanceolate glumes.--_Lolium_ (Rye-grass) has in each tooth of\r\nthe main axis a many-flowered, compressed spikelet, which is placed\r\n_edgewise_ towards it and (with the exception of _L. perenne_) has\r\nonly one outwardly-turned glume (_L. temulentum_ has a rudiment of\r\nthe inwardly-turned lower glume); the terminal spikelet has two\r\nglumes.--_Secale_ (Rye). A two-flowered spikelet in each tooth; small,\r\nlanceolate, acuminate glumes. _Nardus_ and _Lepturus_ have very narrow\r\nspikes, the former with unilateral spikelets.\r\n\r\n=B.= In each notch of the axis 2 or more spikelets are placed close\r\ntogether.--_Hordeum_ (Barley). In each tooth three 1-flowered\r\nspikelets. _H. hexastichum_ (6-rowed Barley), has 6 rows of fruits,\r\nsince all the spikelets are fertile, and _H. distichum_ (2-rowed\r\nBarley) 2 rows, since the lateral spikelets are (♂, and barren (p.\r\n292).--_Elymus_ has 2–6 many-flowered spikelets in each joint of the\r\nmain axis. _Ægilops_ has awns upon the glumes.\r\n\r\n   DISTRIBUTION. 315 genera with 3,500 species. The order is\r\n   distributed over the whole world, and as regards number of\r\n   individuals is perhaps the richest. In the Tropics, large,\r\n   broad-leaved, tree-like forms are found (_Bambuseæ_, _Olyreæ_,\r\n   _Andropogoneæ_, etc.; in S. Europe, _Arundo donax_); in England,\r\n   next to the Compositæ, it is the order most rich in species\r\n   (about 134).--The origin of some of the cultivated Grasses\r\n   is lost in obscurity. The Maize, no doubt, was indigenous to\r\n   America, where its nearest relatives are found, and where it\r\n   has also been discovered in ancient Indian graves; Durra or\r\n   Guinea-corn, Millet and Sugar-cane are South Asiatic plants, and\r\n   our own cereals no doubt have sprung primarily from Western Asia\r\n   and South-Eastern Europe (Barley from Armenia and Persia, where\r\n   a very closely related wild species is found; Wheat from the\r\n   same districts; Rye from the perennial species _S. montanum_).\r\n   _Panicum altissimum_ and Rice have come from Africa.\r\n\r\n   USES. The Grasses play a very important part as cereals and\r\n   fodder plants. The following are the most important of the\r\n   cultivated ones: _Triticum vulgare_ (common Wheat), _turgidum_,\r\n   _amyleum_, _polonicum_, _spelta_, _durum_, etc.; _Secale\r\n   cereale_ (Rye); Barley (_Hordeum_-species, see under the genus);\r\n   Maize; Oats (_Avena sativa_, _orientalis_, _nuda_); Millet\r\n   (_Panicum miliaceum_); Durra (Turkish Millet, or Guinea-corn,\r\n   _Sorghum vulgare_, _cernuum_ and _saccharatum_); Manna-grass\r\n   (_Glyceria fluitans_). As fodder-plants especially: Rye-grass\r\n   (_Lolium perenne_); Oat-grass (_Avena elatior_); Timothy\r\n   (_Phleum pratense_); Fox-tail (_Alopecurus pratensis_);\r\n   Cock’s foot (_Dactylis glomerata_); Dog’s tail (_Cynosurus\r\n   cristatus_); Sweet-vernal (_Anthoxanthum odoratum_); Soft grass,\r\n   or Yorkshire-fog (_Holcus lanatus_ and _mollis_); Quaking-grass\r\n   (_Briza media_); species of Meadow-grass (_Poa_); Fescue\r\n   (_Festuca_) and Brome (_Bromus_).--Several cultivated species of\r\n   Grass are also used in the preparation of _fermented liquors_,\r\n   the starch in the seeds being transformed to _sugar_ (beer\r\n   from “Malt,” _i.e._ the germinated Barley; arrack from Rice);\r\n   or the stem becomes specially saccharine before flowering: the\r\n   Sugar-cane, _Sorghum saccharatum_.\r\n\r\n   OFFICINAL. The rhizome of _Triticum repens_, Oat-grain, flour of\r\n   Barley, and the starch of Wheat, also sugar.\r\n\r\n   The seeds of _Lolium temulentum_ are considered\r\n   _poisonous_.--The stems of many species (including our common\r\n   grains) are used in the manufacture of paper, especially\r\n   “Esparto grass” (_Stipa tenacissima_) from Spain and N.\r\n   Africa, and the sheathing-leaves of the ♀-spike of _Maize_.\r\n   Sand Lyme-grass (_Elymus arenarius_), and especially _Psamma\r\n   arenaria_, are important.--But few Grass-species are\r\n   _sweet-scented_: _Anthoxanthum odoratum_ and _Hierochloa\r\n   odorata_ contain coumarin; _Andropogon_-species have essential\r\n   oils (“Citronella oil”).--ORNAMENTAL PLANTS are: the\r\n   “Ribbon-grass” (a variety of _Digraphis arundinacea_), _Stipa\r\n   pennata_ (whose awn is exceedingly long and feathery), _Gynerium\r\n   argenteum_ (Pampas-grass), _Lagurus ovatus_, _Hordeum jubatum_,\r\n   _Bromus briziformis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 3. =Spadicifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe primitive form resembles that of the preceding family. In it\r\nwe find the typical, perfectly developed, Monocotyledonous flower,\r\nsometimes even with free carpels and with a dry or somewhat fleshy, but\r\nnever petaloid perianth; and this passes over into very different forms\r\nby the suppression of the floral-leaves, perianth and sporophylls\r\n(unisexual flowers are common), and by the close aggregation of the\r\nflowers in the inflorescence. The flower is _hypogynous_ in every case.\r\nThe inflorescence is a _spike_ which may be either single or branched,\r\nand has often a thick and fleshy axis (a _spadix_). In Palms and Araceæ\r\nit is enveloped, at any rate prior to the opening of the flowers, by a\r\nvery large floral-leaf, _the spathe_, which may be petaloid (Figs. 297,\r\n301).\r\n\r\nThe fruit is most frequently fleshy (_berry_, _drupe_) or a _nut_,\r\nnever a capsule. The embryo is small, with large, fleshy endosperm\r\n(Fig. 299 _C_); very rarely the endosperm is wanting.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 295.--Piassava (_Attalea funifera_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 296.--A portion of the stem of _Attalea\r\n  funifera_ with persistent leaf-bases.]\r\n\r\nThe numerous plants belonging to this family are large, herbaceous or\r\ntree-like, and the leaves seldom have the usual Monocotyledonous form,\r\n_i.e._ linear with parallel venation, but most frequently have pinnate\r\nor palmate venation.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Palmæ (Palms).= The majority are trees with an _unbranched_,\r\ncylindrical _stem_, having short internodes and covered with leaf-scars\r\nor the bases of the leaf-stalks (Fig. 296), and at the summit a rosette\r\nof large leaves closely packed together (Fig. 295). An exception to\r\nthis is found in _Calamus_ (Cane, “Rotang”), whose thin, creeping or\r\nclimbing stems have long internodes; sparsely[28] branched is, _e.g._\r\nthe African Doum-palm (_Hyphæne_). Notwithstanding their often enormous\r\nstems the Palms have fibrous roots, like the bulbous Monocotyledons.\r\nThe leaves are pinnate (Feather-palms, Fig. 298) or palmate (Fan-palms,\r\nFig. 295) and often very large; they have a well-developed petiole\r\nwith an _amplexicaul sheath_, which is often more or less separated\r\ninto a large number of fibres. _In the bud the blade is entire but\r\nfolded_, as the leaf expands the lines of folding are torn, either\r\nthose which are turned upwards (thus ∨ ∨ ∨ ∨, _e.g. Pritchardia_,\r\n_Livistona_, _Phœnix_, _Chamærops_) or those turned downwards (thus\r\n∧ ∧ ∧ ∧, _e.g. Cocos_, _Chamædorea_, _Calamus_). The inflorescence\r\nis usually lateral; when, as in Sago-palm (_Metroxylon rumphii_)\r\nor Talipot (_Corypha umbraculifera_) it is terminal, the plant is\r\nmonocarpic, and dies after flowering; it is often a very _large_\r\nand _branched spadix_ with numerous flowers either borne externally\r\nor embedded in it, and enclosed either in one woody, boat-shaped\r\n_spathe_ (Fig. 297) or several spathes, in the latter case one for each\r\nbranch. The flowers are sessile or even embedded, regular, generally\r\n_unisexual_ (monœcious or diœcious) with the usual diagram (Fig.\r\n278); the perianth is inconspicuous, green or yellow, persistent, and\r\nmore or less leathery or fleshy. 6, rarely 3 or many stamens. The 3\r\ncarpels remain either _distinct_ or form one, generally 3-locular,\r\novary. The style is short. There is _one ovule in each carpel_. Often\r\nduring ripening 2 carpels with their ovules are aborted. The fruit is\r\na _berry_, _drupe_ or _nut_, generally one-seeded, with a large horny\r\nor bony endosperm with hard thick-walled cells (_e.g._ Date-palm). In\r\nsome (_e.g._ Cocoanut) it is thin-walled, soft, and oily; in several\r\n“ruminate.”\r\n\r\n   When _germination_ commences in the Cocoanut, Date, etc., the\r\n   apex of the cotyledon remains in the seed and developes into\r\n   a spongy mass to withdraw the endosperm; in the Cocoanut it\r\n   attains a considerable size (Fig. 299 _C_) and assumes the\r\n   form of the fruit. The endosperm in the Cocoanut is hollow and\r\n   the interior is filled with “milk.” In the Date-palm and the\r\n   Vegetable-ivory (_Phytelephas_) the cell-walls of the hard\r\n   endosperm serve as reserve material.\r\n\r\n=1.= PHŒNICEÆ. _Phœnix_ (Date-palm) has pinnate leaves with channeled\r\nleaflets and diœcious flowers with 8 free carpels, of which usually\r\nonly one developes into a berry with membranous endocarp; the large\r\nseed has a deep furrow on the inner side, and horny endosperm.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 297.--Inflorescence of a Palm with spathe. At\r\n  the top ♂-, at the base ♀-flowers.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 298.--_Livistona australis._]\r\n\r\n=2.= SABALEÆ. These have fan-like leaves with channeled segments;\r\nflowers ☿ or polygamous, rarely diœcious, with 3 separate or only\r\nslightly united carpels, all of which are sometimes developed\r\ninto fruits (berry or drupe, with thin stone).--_Chamærops_, the\r\nDwarf-palm. The pericarp is externally fleshy, internally more\r\nfibrous, and provided with a membranous inner layer. The endosperm is\r\nruminate (that is, the testa is several times deeply folded into the\r\nendosperm).--_Sabal_, _Copernicia_, _Livistona_ (Fig. 298), _Thrinax_,\r\n_Corypha_, _Brahea_, and others.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 299.--_A_ Longitudinal section of a Cocoanut\r\n  (diminished), the inner layer only (the stone) not being divided\r\n  _B_ End view of the stone, showing the sutures for the 3 carpels\r\n  (_a_), and the 3 germ-pores; the embryo emerges from the lowest\r\n  one when germination begins. _C_ Germinating; inside the stone is\r\n  seen the hollow endosperm and the enlarging cotyledon.]\r\n\r\n=3.= COCOINEÆ. With pinnate leaves. Monœcious inflorescence. The\r\ncarpels are united into a 3-locular ovary. The fruit is most frequently\r\n1-locular, only 1 of the loculi becoming developed, rarely 3-locular;\r\nit is a drupe with a large, fibrous, external layer (_mesocarp_) and\r\nmost frequently a very hard inner layer (_endocarp_, stone) which\r\nhas 3 germ-pores, the 2 of these, however, which correspond to the\r\nsuppressed loculi are closed; internal to the third lies the small\r\nembryo (Fig. 299). Endosperm containing abundance of oil. _Cocos_ (the\r\nCocoanut-palm), _Attalea_, _Elæis_, _Acrocomia_, _Bactris_.\r\n\r\n=4.= LEPIDOCARYINÆ. The floral-leaves and flowers are borne in 2\r\nrows on the spadix. The carpels are united into one 3-locular ovary;\r\nthe fruit is coated by a layer of hard, shining, imbricate scales.\r\nThe majority of the species are thorny, and climb by means of the\r\nthorny leaves. Some have fan-like (_Mauritia_), others pinnate leaves\r\n(_Raphia_, _Calamus_, _Eugeissonia_, _Metroxylon_; the stems of the\r\nlatter die after the first flowering).\r\n\r\n   =5.= BORASSINÆ. Large Fan-palms without thorns, with 3-locular\r\n   ovary. Drupe with separate stones. _Latania_ and _Lodoicea_ have\r\n   many stamens; _Hyphæne_; _Borassus_ (Palmyra-palm).\r\n\r\n   =6.= ARECINEÆ. The most numerous group. Feather-palms. Berry.\r\n   _Areca_, _Euterpe_, _Oreodoxa_, _Ceroxylon_, _Chamædorea_,\r\n   _Geonoma_, _Caryota_ with bipinnate leaves.\r\n\r\n   =7.= PHYTELEPHANTINÆ. Flowers with rudimentary perianth united\r\n   in close capitula. _Phytelephas_ (Vegetable-ivory). _Nipa._\r\n\r\n   DISTRIBUTION. About 1,100 species are known. In Europe\r\n   only the Dwarf-palm (_Chamærops humilis_) is wild (Western\r\n   Mediterranean). The Date palm (_Phœnix dactylifera_) belongs\r\n   to North Africa and West Asia. Other African genera are\r\n   _Hyphæne_ (Doum-palm) and _Elæis_ (_E. guineensis_, Oil-palm).\r\n   A large majority of the genera are found in South America and\r\n   in the East Indies. The following are AMERICAN:--_Mauritia_,\r\n   _Acrocomia_, _Bactris_, _Chamædorea_, _Oreodoxa_, _Euterpe_,\r\n   _Attalea_, etc. ASIATIC:--_Metroxylon_, _Calamus_, _Areca_,\r\n   _Borassus_, _Lodoicea_ (“Double-cocoanuts,” Seychelles) and\r\n   others. The Cocoanut-palm has perhaps an American origin; all\r\n   the other species of the same genus being endemic in America;\r\n   it is the only Palm found on the coral islands of the Pacific\r\n   Ocean, and is also the only one which is common to both\r\n   hemispheres.\r\n\r\n   USES. Palms belong to the most useful plants; they contain no\r\n   poison, and are of little medicinal interest, but are largely\r\n   employed in the arts and manufactures, the hard timber being\r\n   adapted for many purposes on account of the hard tissue in\r\n   which the vascular bundles are embedded. “Cane” is the stem\r\n   of _Calamus_-species (from India). SAGO is obtained from the\r\n   pith of _Metroxylon rumphii_ (Sago-palm, Sunda-Is., Moluccas),\r\n   _Mauritia flexuosa_, etc. Sugar-containing sap (“palm wine”) is\r\n   obtained from the American _Mauritia vinifera_ and _flexuosa_,\r\n   _Borassus flabelliformis_ (Asiatic Palmyra-palm), _Arenga\r\n   saccharifera_, etc., by cutting off the young inflorescences,\r\n   or by perforating the stem before the flowering (_arrack_ is\r\n   distilled from this). _Vascular strands_ for the manufacture of\r\n   mats and brushes, etc., are obtained from the outer covering\r\n   (mesocarp) of the Cocoanut, and from the detached leaf-sheaths\r\n   of _Attalea funifera_ (Brazil) (Fig. 296). WAX is yielded by the\r\n   leaves of _Copernicia cerifera_ (carnaueba-wax, Amazon region),\r\n   and by the stem of _Ceroxylon andicola_ (palm-wax, Andes);\r\n   East Indian _Dragon’s blood_ is from the fruit of _Calamus\r\n   draco_; the young buds of many species, especially _Euterpe_,\r\n   _Cocos_, _Attalea_, etc., are used as “cabbage.” Palm-oil is\r\n   obtained from the oily mesocarp of the plum-like fruits of\r\n   _Elæis guineensis_ (W. Africa), and from the seeds, when it is\r\n   largely used in the manufacture of soap. EDIBLE FRUITS from the\r\n   Date-palm (_Phœnix dactylifera_, Arabia, Egypt, W. Africa), and\r\n   the endosperm of the Cocoanut (_Cocos nucifera_). The seeds\r\n   and the unripe fruits of the Areca-palm (_Areca catechu_)\r\n   are chewed with the leaves of the Betelpeper, principally in\r\n   Asia. VEGETABLE IVORY from the hard endosperm of _Phytelephas\r\n   macrocarpa_ (S. America.)--Many species are cultivated in\r\n   the tropics as ornamental plants, but in this country only\r\n   _Chamærops humilis_, _Livistona australis_ and _chinensis_ are\r\n   generally grown. In addition to the few just mentioned, many\r\n   others are of importance, but these are much the most useful.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Cyclanthaceæ.= This is a small order related to the\r\n   Palms (44 species from Tropical America), with fan-like, folded\r\n   leaves. The flowers are unisexual and arranged in whorls or\r\n   close spirals on an unbranched spadix. Ovary unilocular, ovules\r\n   numerous. To this belongs _Carludovica palmata_, whose leaves\r\n   are used for Panama hats.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Pandanaceæ= (Screw-pines) is another small order,\r\n   forming a transition to the Araceæ. The woody, (apparently)\r\n   dichotomous stem is supported by a large number of aerial roots,\r\n   which sometimes entirely support it when the lower portion of\r\n   the stem has decayed. The leaves are closely crowded together,\r\n   and arranged on the branches in three rows, which are often\r\n   obliquely displaced, with the formation of three spiral lines;\r\n   they are, as in the Bromeliaceæ, amplexicaul, long, linear,\r\n   the edge and lower midrib often provided with thorns. The\r\n   ♂-flowers are borne in branched, the ♀ in unbranched spadices\r\n   or capitula, which resemble those of _Sparganium_, but have no\r\n   floral-leaves. Perianth absent. The drupes or berries unite into\r\n   multiple fruits.--About 80 species in the islands of the Indian\r\n   Ocean.--_Pandanus_, _Freycinetia_.--Fossils perhaps in the chalk\r\n   of the Harz.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Typhaceæ.= The flowers are unisexual, monœcious, and borne\r\non a cylindrical spike or globose capitulum; ♂ inflorescences above,\r\nthe ♀ below. The perianth consists of a definite number of scales\r\n(_Sparganium_), or in its place numerous irregularly-arranged hairs are\r\nfound (_Typha_); in the ♂-flower there are generally three stamens; the\r\ngynœceum is formed of 1–2 carpels with 1 prolonged style; 1 pendulous\r\novule. The seeds are furnished with a seed-cover, which is cast off on\r\ngermination.--The few species (about 20) which belong to this order are\r\nmarsh plants with creeping rhizome (and hence grow in clusters); the\r\nleaves on the aerial shoots are borne in two rows, entire, very long\r\nand linear.\r\n\r\n_Sparganium_ (Bur-reed). The flowers are borne in globose capitula;\r\nthe perianth distinct, generally consisting of 3 small scales; pistil\r\nbicarpellate. Drupe, dry and woody. ~The stalk of the lower ♀ capitula\r\nis sometimes united with the main axis, and consequently the capitula\r\nare situated high above their subtending-leaf.~\r\n\r\n_Typha_ (Bulrush, Reed-mace) has a long, cylindrical, brown spike,\r\nthe lower portion bearing ♀-flowers, and the upper ♂-flowers, which\r\nis divided into joints by alternate leaves. The ♀-flowers have 1\r\ncarpel. The perianth is wanting, represented by a number of fine,\r\nirregularly-placed hairs; pistil unicarpellate. Fruit a nut.\r\n\r\n   The two genera, according to some, are related to the 2nd order.\r\n   In both genera native species are found. The pollination is\r\n   effected by the wind, and consequently the anthers project\r\n   considerably, and the stigma is large and hairy. _Typha_ is\r\n   protandrous, _Sparganium_ protogynous. The small, fine hairs\r\n   surrounding the nut of _Typha_ assist in its distribution by the\r\n   wind.--Fossil _Typhas_ in the Tertiary.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Araceæ= (=Arums=). The flowers are small, and always borne\r\n_without bracts or bracteoles_ on _an unbranched_, often very fleshy\r\nspike, which is enclosed by a spathe, often petaloid and coloured (Fig.\r\n301). The fruit is a _berry_. Outer integument of the seed fleshy.--The\r\nleaves have generally sheath, stalk, and blade with distinctly\r\n_reticulate_ venation; they are chiefly cordate or sagittate (Fig.\r\n302), seldom long with parallel venation as in the other Monocotyledons\r\n(_Acorus_, Fig. 300). The Araceæ are quite _glabrous_, generally\r\n_perennial herbs_ with tubers or rhizomes. Many have latex.--For the\r\nrest the structure of these plants varies; for example, while some\r\nhave a perianth, in others it is wanting; in some the perianth-leaves\r\nare free, in others united; some have hermaphrodite flowers, but the\r\nmajority unisexual (monœcious); some have free, others united stamens;\r\nthe ovules are orthotropous, anatropous, or campylotropous, erect or\r\npendulous; the ovary is 1–many-locular; some have seeds with endosperm,\r\nothers without. ~_In habit_ there are great differences. While some,\r\n_e.g. Colocasia_ (Fig. 302), have a thick, more or less upright stem,\r\nwith leaf-scars, but not woody, others are climbers, epiphytic, and\r\nmaintain themselves firmly by means of adventitious roots, on the stems\r\nand branches of trees, or even on steep rocks, _e.g. Philodendron_;\r\nthe cordate, penninerved leaf is the most common (Fig. 302), but\r\nvarious branched forms appear; the pedate leaves of _Helicophyllum_,\r\n_Dracunculus_, etc., are cymosely branched; the leaves of _Monstera\r\ndeliciosa_, perforated by tearing, should be noticed (the vascular\r\nbundles while in the bud grow faster than the tissue between them,\r\ncausing the latter to be torn, and the leaf perforated). With regard to\r\nthe anatomical structure, the presence or absence of latex, raphides,\r\nresin-passages, groups of mucilage-cells should be noted. Engler makes\r\nuse of these anatomical peculiarities for a scientific arrangement of\r\nthe order.~\r\n\r\n=A.= ORONTIEÆ, CALAMUS-GROUP. ☿, hypogynous flowers of a completely\r\nformed monocotyledonous type (number in the whorls 2, 3, or\r\n4).--_Acorus_ (_A. calamus_, Sweet-flag) has a regular, 3-merous,\r\npentacyclic flower (Fig. 300 _C_, _D_). They are marsh-plants, with\r\ncreeping rhizome, triangular stem, and long, sword-like leaves (Fig.\r\n300 _A_); the inflorescence is terminal, apparently lateral, being\r\npushed to one side by the upright, sword-like spathe (Fig. 300\r\n_B_).--~_Anthurium_ (Pr2+2, A2+2, G2); _Pothos_; _Orontium_ (unilocular\r\novary with one ovule), etc.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 300.--_Acorus calamus_: _A_ habit (much\r\n  reduced); _B_ inflorescence; _C_ a flower; _D_ diagram; _E_\r\n  longitudinal section of an ovary; _F_ an ovule.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 301.--_Arum maculatum._ The spathe (_h_) in\r\n  _B_ is longitudinally divided.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 302.--_Colocasia Boryi._]\r\n\r\n=B.= CALLEÆ. Flowers hypogynous, naked, ☿.--_Calla_ (_C. palustris_).\r\nAll flowers in the spike are fertile, or the upper ones are ♂; 6–9\r\nstamens; ovary unilocular with many basal ovules. Marsh-plants with\r\ncreeping rhizome and cordate leaves.--_Monstera_, _Rhaphidophora_, etc.\r\n\r\n=C.= ARINEÆ. Flowers monœcious, naked, ♂-flowers on the upper, ♀ on the\r\nlower part of the spadix.--_Arum_ (Fig. 301). The spadix terminates in\r\na naked, club-like portion (_k_); below this is a number of sessile\r\nbodies (rudimentary flowers), with broad bases and prolonged, pointed\r\ntips (_b_); underneath these are the ♂-flowers (_m_), each consisting\r\nonly of 3–4 short stamens, which eject vermiform pollen-masses through\r\nthe terminal pores; then follow, last of all, ♀-flowers (_f_), each of\r\nwhich consists of one unilocular ovary, with several ovules. Perennial\r\nherbs, tuberous, with cordate leaves.--~_Dracunculus_; _Biarum_;\r\n_Arisarum_; _Pinellia (Atherurus) ternata_ with leaves bearing 1–2\r\nbuds. _Zantedeschia æthiopica_ (_Richardia_, Nile-lily); ♂, 2–3\r\nstamens; ♀ with 3 staminodes, 1–5-locular ovary (S. Africa.)--In some\r\ngenera sterile flowers are present between the ♂ and ♀ portions of\r\nthe spadix (_e.g._ in _Philodendron_); in _Ambrosinia_ a lateral,\r\nwing-like broadening of the axis of the spadix divides the cavity\r\nof the spathe into two chambers, the anterior containing one ♀, and\r\nthe posterior 8–10 ♂-flowers in two series; in some the stamens in\r\nthe single ♂-flowers unite and form a columnar “synandrium” (_e.g._\r\nin _Dieffenbachia_, _Colocasia_, _Alocasia_, _Caladium_, _Taccarum_,\r\n_Syngonium_). A remarkable spadix is found in _Spathicarpa_; it is\r\nunited for its entire length, on one side, with the spathe, and the\r\nflowers are arranged upon it in rows, the ♀ to the outside, and the\r\n♂ in the middle (_Zostera_ has a similar one).--_Pistia_ similarly\r\ndeviates considerably, it is a floating water-plant, with hairy, round\r\nrosettes of leaves; in it also the spathe and spadix are united; at the\r\nbase a ♀-flower is borne, which consists of one unilocular ovary, and\r\nabove several ♂-flowers, each composed of two united stamens.~\r\n\r\n   BIOLOGY. The inflorescences are adapted for\r\n   _insect-pollination_; they are protogynous, since the viscous,\r\n   almost sessile stigmas come to maturity and wither before the\r\n   pollen, which is generally dehisced by apical pores, is shed;\r\n   some pollinate themselves freely by the pollen from the higher\r\n   ♂-flowers falling upon the ♀-flowers below them, and in some\r\n   it is conjectured that the pollination is effected by snails.\r\n   The coloured spathe, and the naked end of the spadix (often\r\n   coloured) of certain genera function as the coloured perianth in\r\n   other orders; during flowering a very powerful smell is often\r\n   emitted. _Arum maculatum_ is worthy of notice; small flies\r\n   and midges creep down into the spathe, between the sterile\r\n   flowers (Fig. 301 _b_), which are situated where the spathe is\r\n   constricted, and pointing obliquely downwards prevent the escape\r\n   of the insects; in the meantime, the stigmas are in a condition\r\n   to receive any pollen they may have brought with them; after\r\n   pollination the stigmas wither, and exude small drops of honey\r\n   as a compensation to the flies for their imprisonment; after\r\n   this the anthers (_m_) open and shed their pollen, the sterile\r\n   flowers wither, and the insects are then able to escape, and\r\n   enter and pollinate other inflorescences.--In many, a _rise\r\n   of temperature_ and evolution of carbonic acid takes place\r\n   during flowering; a spadix may be raised as much as 30°C. above\r\n   the temperature of the surrounding air.--Again, under certain\r\n   conditions, many species absorb such large quantities of water\r\n   by their roots that water is forced out in drops from the tip of\r\n   the leaf; this may often be observed in _Zantedeschia_.\r\n\r\n   About 900 species in 100 genera. Home, the Tropics, especially\r\n   S. America, India, and the Indian Islands, preferably in shady,\r\n   damp forests growing as epiphytes upon trees, and on the banks\r\n   of streams. Outside the Tropics few are found. _Acorus calamus_\r\n   was introduced into Europe from Asia about 300 years ago; it,\r\n   however, never sets any fruit, as the pollen is unfertile. In\r\n   England _Arum maculatum_ is a very common plant; this and _A.\r\n   italicum_ are the only native species. _Colocasia antiquorum_\r\n   comes from Polynesia and the Indian Islands, and also _Alocasia\r\n   macrorrhiza_. Fossils in Cretaceous and Tertiary.\r\n\r\n   USES. Many species have pungent, and even _poisonous properties_\r\n   (_e.g. Dieffenbachia_, _Lagenandra_, _Arum_), which are easily\r\n   removed by boiling or roasting; the _rhizomes_ of many species\r\n   of _Caladium_, _Colocasia_ (_C. antiquorum_, _esculenta_, etc.),\r\n   are very rich in starch, and in the Tropics form an important\r\n   source of food. An uncommon occurrence in the order is the\r\n   highly aromatic rhizome of _Acorus calamus_; this contains\r\n   calamus-oil and acorin which are used in perfumery. Many are\r\n   ornamental plants, _e.g. Zantedeschia æthiopica_ (South Africa),\r\n   generally known as “Calla,” and _Monstera deliciosa_; many other\r\n   species are grown in greenhouses.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Lemnaceæ (Duck-weeds).= These are the most reduced form of\r\nthe Spadicifloræ. They are very small, free-swimming water-plants.\r\nThe vegetative system resembles a small, leaf-like body (Fig. 303\r\n_f-f_), from which roots hang downwards; this branches by producing a\r\nnew, similar leaf-like body, which springs from a pocket-like hollow\r\n(indicated by a dotted line in the figure) on each side of the\r\nolder one, at its base (or only on one side). ~The branching is thus\r\ndichasial or helicoid (Fig. 303 _A_, where _f, f′, f″, f″′_ indicate\r\nshoots of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th generations respectively). The leaf-like\r\nbodies are, according to Hegelmaier, leaf-like stems, and thus _Lemna_\r\nhas no other leaves than the spathe and the sporophylls; according\r\nto the investigations of Engler they are stems whose upper portion\r\n(above the “pocket”) is a leaf, which is not sharply separated from\r\nthe underlying stem-portion. The inflorescence is a very much reduced\r\nAraceous-spadix, consisting in _Lemna_ of 1 or 2 stamens of unequal\r\nlength (1-stamened ♂-flowers), 1 unilocular carpel (♀-flower), and\r\n1 thin spathe (_B_). [The same is found in _Spirodela polyrrhiza_,\r\netc., whose daughter-shoots begin in addition with 1 basal-leaf.\r\n_Wolffia arrhiza_, etc., have no roots, no spathe, and only 1 ♂-flower\r\nin the inflorescence (Engler).]--On the germination of the seed a\r\nportion of the testa is thrown off as a lid, so that an exit is opened\r\nfor the radicle.--19 species. In stagnant fresh water, both Temp.\r\nand Tropical.--In Europe the species are _Lemna minor, trisulca,\r\ngibba; Spirodela polyrrhiza_, and _Wolffia arrhiza_, the smallest\r\nFlowering-plant.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 303.--_Lemna_: _A_ vegetative system; _B_\r\n  portion of a plant with flowers; one stamen and tip of the carpel\r\n  project; the remaining portions being indicated by the dotted\r\n  line.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 4. =Enantioblastæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers in this family are _hypogynous_ and have in part the\r\ngeneral monocotyledonous type with 5 trimerous whorls completely\r\ndeveloped in a regular hermaphrodite flower, and in part the flowers\r\nso much reduced that the type is very difficult to trace. On the one\r\nhand the family is well developed and has capitate inflorescences\r\n(_Eriocaulaceæ_) and on the other hand it is distinctly reduced\r\n(_Centrolepidaceceæ_). This family has taken its name from the fact\r\nthat the ovule is not, as in the Liliifloræ and nearly all other\r\nMonocotyledons, anatropous, but _orthotropous_, so that the embryo\r\n(βλάστη) becomes placed _at the end of the seed opposite_ (ἐναντίος)\r\n_to the hilum_. Large, mealy endosperm.--The orders belonging to this\r\nfamily are by certain authors grouped with the _Bromeliaceæ_ and\r\n_Pontederiaceæ_, etc., into one family, FARINOSEÆ, so named on account\r\nof the mealy endosperm, the distinguishing character of the Liliifloræ\r\nthen being that the endosperm is fleshy and horny.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Commelinaceæ.= The complete Liliaceous structure\r\n   without great reductions in the number of whorls, but with\r\n   generally few ovules in each loculus of the ovary, is found in\r\n   the Commelinaceæ, an almost exclusively tropical order with\r\n   about 317 species; herbs, some of which are introduced into\r\n   our gardens and greenhouses. The stems are nodose; the leaves\r\n   often _clasping_; the flowers are arranged in unipared scorpioid\r\n   cymes, often so that they form a zig-zag series falling in\r\n   the median line of the bracts, and after flowering they bend\r\n   regularly to the right or left, outwards or inwards. They\r\n   are more or less _zygomorphic_, particularly in the stamens,\r\n   which in the same flower are of different forms or partially\r\n   suppressed. The outer series of the _perianth_ is sepaloid,\r\n   the inner petaloid, generally violet or blue; the filaments\r\n   are sometimes clothed with hairs formed of rows of bead-like\r\n   cells (well known for showing protoplasmic movements). Fruit\r\n   a trilocular _capsule_ with loculicidal dehiscence (generally\r\n   few-seeded); in some a nut. The radicle is covered by an\r\n   external, warty, projecting covering which is cast off on\r\n   germination.--The abundant raphides lie in elongated cells whose\r\n   transverse walls they perforate.--_Commelina, Tradescantia,\r\n   Tinantia, Cyanotis, Dichorisandra_.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Mayacaceæ.= This order is closely allied to the\r\n   Commelinaceæ. 7 species. American marsh- or water-plants.\r\n\r\n   In many of the following orders of this family the flowers are\r\n   united into compound inflorescences, with which is accompanied a\r\n   reduction in the flower.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Xyridaceæ= (50 species). Marsh-plants with radical,\r\n   often equitant leaves arranged in 2 rows, and short spikes on\r\n   long (twisted) stalks. The flowers, as in the Commelinaceæ, have\r\n   sepals (which however are more chaffy) and petals, but the outer\r\n   series of stamens is wanting. Capsule (generally many-seeded).\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Rapateaceæ.= Marsh-plants with radical leaves, usually\r\n   in two rows, and several spikelets on the summit of the main\r\n   axis, clustered into a capitulum or unilateral spike. Each\r\n   spikelet has numerous imbricate floral-leaves and one flower. 24\r\n   species. South America.\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Eriocaulaceæ.= The “Compositæ among Monocotyledons,”\r\n   a tropical order. The flowers are borne in a _capitulum_\r\n   surrounded by an _involucre_, very similar to that of the\r\n   Compositæ. The flowers are very small, unisexual, ♂ and ♀\r\n   often mixed indiscriminately in the same capitulum; they have\r\n   the usual pentacyclic structure; the leaves of the inner\r\n   perianth are often connate and more membranous than the outer;\r\n   in some the outer series of stamens are suppressed; in each of\r\n   the 3 loculi is one pendulous ovule. Capsule. The leaves are\r\n   generally radical and grass-like.--335 species; _Eriocaulon_,\r\n   _Paepalanthus_, etc., _E. septangulare_ on the west coast of\r\n   Scotland, and Ireland, and in North America.\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Restiaceæ.= A small, especially S. African and S.\r\n   Australian, xerophilous order (about 235 species), which is\r\n   quite similar in habit to the Juncaceæ and Cyperaceæ. The\r\n   leaves are often reduced to sheaths. The flowers are diœcious,\r\n   the perianth as in _Juncus_, but the outer series of stamens\r\n   suppressed. The ovary and fruit as in Eriocaulaceæ; the ovary,\r\n   however, may be unilocular, and the fruit a nut. _Restio_, etc.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Centrolepidaceæ.= These are the most reduced plants\r\n   in the family; small grass- or rush-like herbs. The flowers\r\n   are very small, naked.

Stem\r\nleafless with a compound umbellate or capitate inflorescence of\r\nunipared helicoid cymes, which before flowering are surrounded\r\nby two broad involucral leaves.--~_Allium._ Filaments often\r\npetaloid and bidentate; in many species bulbils are found in the\r\ninflorescence.--Some species have flat leaves: _A. sativum_, Garlic;\r\n_A. porrum_, Leek; _A. ursinum_; others have round, hollow leaves:\r\n_A. cepa_, Onion; _A. fistulosum_, Winter Onion; _A. ascalonicum_,\r\nEschalot; _A. schænoprasum_, Chive.~--_Gagea_; honey is secreted\r\nat the base of the perianth, no special nectary; inflorescence\r\nfew-flowered.--_Agapanthus; Triteleia._\r\n\r\n   =D.= ANTHERICEÆ. Rhizome; raceme; the leaves not fleshy and\r\n   thick.--_Anthericum_; _Asphodelus_; _Bulbine_; _Chlorophytum_;\r\n   _Bowiea_ has an almost leafless stem with curved, climbing\r\n   branches.\r\n\r\n   =E.= ALOINEÆ, ALOES. Stem generally aerial and tree-like,\r\n   bearing on its summit thick, fleshy leaves, often with a thorny\r\n   edge (Fig. 306). Raceme branched or unbranched.--_Aloë_;\r\n   _Gasteria_; _Yucca_ (has secondary thickening, p. 274).\r\n\r\n   =F.= HEMEROCALLIDEÆ. _Phormium_, (_Ph. tenax._ New Zealand\r\n   Flax); _Funckia_ (_Hosta_); _Hemerocallis_.\r\n\r\n   At this point the following are best placed: _Aphyllanthes_\r\n   (_A. monspeliensis_); _Xanthorrhæa_ (Black-boy); _Xerotes_;\r\n   _Lomandra_; _Kingia_; the very membranous, dry perianth of the\r\n   last resembles that of the Juncaceæ, and also there are only\r\n   1–few ovules in the loculi.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION by insects. Honey in some is produced on the\r\n   perianth (see Tulipeæ), in others by glands on the carpels (in\r\n   the septa and parietal placentæ, septal glands): _Hyacinthus_,\r\n   _Allium_, _Anthericum_, _Asphodelus_, _Yucca_, _Funckia_,\r\n   _Hemerocallis_, etc. Some _Allium_-species are protandrous.\r\n   _Fritillaria_ is visited by bees, _Lilium martagon_ by moths,\r\n   _L. bulbiferum_ by butterflies, _Phormium_ (New Zealand) by\r\n   honey-birds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 306.--Aloë.]\r\n\r\n   About 1,580 species; rare in cold climates; their home is in\r\n   sunny plains with firm, hard soil, and warm or mild climate,\r\n   particularly in the Old World (S. Africa; As. Steppes;\r\n   Mediterranean); at the commencement of spring the flowers\r\n   appear in great profusion, and after the course of a few weeks\r\n   disappear; during the hot season their life lies dormant in the\r\n   bulb, hidden underground. The woody species are tropical.--The\r\n   majority of the _introduced_ Liliaceæ (_Fritillaria imperialis_,\r\n   Crown-imperial; _Lilium candidum_; _Tulipa gesneriana_;\r\n   Hyacinth; _Muscari_-species; _Scilla_-species; _Ornithogalum\r\n   nutans_; _Hemerocallis fulva_ and _flava_; _Asphodelus luteus_\r\n   and _albus_) come from the Mediterranean and W. Asia; _Funckia_\r\n   from China and Japan; several Lilies from Japan and the\r\n   Himalayas; _Agapanthus_ from the Cape; _Allium sativum_ is a\r\n   native of the Kerghis-Steppes; _A. cepa_ from Persia (?); _A.\r\n   ascalonicum_ is not known wild (according to others a native of\r\n   Asia Minor), perhaps a form of _A. cepa_; _A. schænoprasum_ from\r\n   the N. temp. region.\r\n\r\n   Many bulbs have pungent properties; many Onions are used as\r\n   culinary plants. The bast fibres of _Phormium tenax_ (New\r\n   Zealand Flax) are used technically. Dyes are obtained from the\r\n   _Aloe_; gum for varnish from the stem of _Xanthorrhæa hostile_\r\n   and _australe_. OFFICINAL; “Aloes,” the dried sap of S. African\r\n   species of _Aloe_ (_A. Africana_, _A. ferox_, etc.); the\r\n   bulb known as “Squills” from _Urginea_ (_Scilla_) _maritima_\r\n   (Mediterranean).\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Convallariaceæ.= This order differs from the Liliaceæ in\r\nhaving the _fruit a berry_ (Fig. 308) and _in never being bulbous_; the\r\nseeds are less numerous.\r\n\r\n=A.= CONVALLARIEÆ, LILY OF THE VALLEY GROUP. Rhizome (Fig. 307) and\r\nnormal foliage-leaves.--_Polygonatum_: rhizome creeping; aerial\r\nshoot leafy, bearing the flowers in racemes in the axils of the\r\nfoliage-leaves; perianth tubular. _P. multiflorum_ (Solomon’s seal),\r\n_P. officinale_, etc.--_Majanthemum_: flower 2-merous; perianth\r\nalmost polyphyllous, spreading. _Smilacina. Streptopus_ (_S.\r\namplexifolius_; the flowers or inflorescence unite with the entire\r\nsucceeding internode).--_Convallaria_ (1 species _C. majalis_, Lily\r\nof the valley); flowers in terminal racemes; 2 basal foliage-leaves;\r\nperianth globose, bell-shaped. _Reineckea carnea_ (Japan, China) in\r\ngardens.--_Paris_ (_P. quadrifolia_, Herb-Paris); flowers solitary,\r\nterminal, 4-merous, polyphyllous; styles 4, free (approaching the\r\nColchicaceæ; it is also poisonous); a whorl of 4 (-more) 3-nerved,\r\nreticulate leaves on each shoot.--Ornamental plants: species of\r\n_Trillium_, _Aspidistra elatior_ (Japan).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 307.--Rhizome of _Polygonatum multiflorum_:\r\n  _a_ bud; _b_ shoot; _c d_ scars left by shoots of previous\r\n  years.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 308.--_Smilax pseudosyphilitica_: _A_ shoot\r\n  of male plant; _C_ ♂-flower; _D_ berry, almost ripe; _E_ the same\r\n  in longitudinal section. _B Smilax syphilitica_: portion of\r\n  branch with base of leaf and tendrils.]\r\n\r\n=B.= ASPARAGEÆ, ASPARAGUS GROUP. Scale-like leaves and green\r\nassimilating branches.--_Asparagus_: horizontal rhizome. The aerial\r\nshoots are very richly branched; the numerous needle-like bodies upon\r\nthe plant are _leafless shoots_, which are crowded together in double\r\nscorpioid cymes in the axils of the scale-leaves; the two first lateral\r\naxes, placed outside to the left and right, generally bear flowers.\r\nPolygamous.--~_Ruscus_ (Butcher’s broom) is a S. European _shrub_ with\r\n_leaf-like_, ovoid or elliptical shoots (phylloclades) which are borne\r\nin the axils of scale-like leaves, and bear flowers on the central\r\nline. Diœcious. Stamens 3, united, anthers extrorse. _Semele androgyna_\r\nbears its flowers on the edge of the flat shoot.~\r\n\r\n=C.= SMILACEÆ. _Smilax_ (Sarsaparilla) (Fig. 308); _climbing_\r\nshrubs with the leaf-sheath produced into tendrils. The leaves have\r\n3–5 strong nerves proceeding from the base, and are reticulate.\r\nOrthotropous or semi-anatropous ovules. Diœcious (Fig. 308 _C_, _E_).\r\n\r\n   =D.= DRACÆNEÆ. Fruit in some a berry, in others a capsule.\r\n   The stem of DRACÆNA, when old, has the appearance of being\r\n   dichotomously branched; it has the power of increase in\r\n   thickness, and may become enormously thick. The Dragon-tree of\r\n   Teneriffe, measured by Humboldt, attained a circumference of\r\n   14 m. and a height of 22 m.; the leaves are large, linear or\r\n   linear-lanceolate.--_Cordyline_ (East Asia), various species in\r\n   gardens and greenhouses (_Yucca_ is closely allied). _Astelia._\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. _Paris quadrifolia_ and _Convallaria majalis_\r\n   have no honey, and are chiefly visited by pollen-collecting\r\n   bees (in the absence of insect visits self-pollination takes\r\n   place); _Polygonatum multiflorum_ has honey secreted by septal\r\n   glands and protected by the base of the tubular perianth; it\r\n   is pollinated by humble-bees, etc. _Asparagus officinalis_ has\r\n   small, polygamous, greenish, honey-bearing flowers; the ♂-flower\r\n   is almost twice as large as the ♀; both have rudiments of the\r\n   opposite sex.\r\n\r\n   About 555 species; especially from N. America, Europe, and\r\n   Central Asia.\r\n\r\n   OFFICINAL: “Dragons’-blood,” a red resinous juice from the stem\r\n   of _Dracæna_ and the roots of some Central American species of\r\n   _Smilax_. The tuberous stems of the Eastern Asiatic _Smilax\r\n   glabra_ are officinal. The flowers of _Convallaria majalis_\r\n   have been lately used as a substitute for _Digitalis_. Pungent,\r\n   poisonous properties are possessed by _Paris_. None of the\r\n   species are used as food, except the young annual shoots of\r\n   _Asparagus officinalis_, a shore-plant which is used as a\r\n   vegetable.\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Pontederiaceæ.= Flowers generally zygomorphic,\r\n   hypogynous, ☿, with handsome, white or violet, petaloid perianth\r\n   which forms a tube at its base. The stamens are inserted at\r\n   different heights in the perianth-tube, and are reduced to\r\n   three (in _Heteranthera_ seldom to one). In some the ovary is\r\n   trilocular with ∞ ovules (_Eichhornia_), in others reduced to\r\n   one loculus with one ovule (_Pontederia_). Fruit a capsule or\r\n   nut. Embryo as long as the abundant, mealy endosperm.--Tropical\r\n   water-plants (22 species) with peculiar sympodial branching,\r\n   nearly the same as in _Zostera_. Spikes without floral-leaves.\r\n   Many intercellular spaces in the stem and leaf.--In greenhouses:\r\n   _Eichhornia azurea_, _E. crassipes_ (both from tropical and\r\n   sub-tropical S. America); the latter has swollen petioles which\r\n   serve as floats and enable it to float freely on the water,\r\n   sending down its roots into the mud. _Heteranthera reniformis,\r\n   H. zosterifolia. Pontederia cordata._\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Amaryllidaceæ (Narcissi).= The flower is _epigynous_,\r\notherwise exactly the same as in the Liliaceæ (6 stamens). The\r\nmajority, like these, are also _perennial_ herbs with bulbs and scapes.\r\nThe fruit and the other characters as in the Liliaceæ. The external\r\nappearance is, however, very different.\r\n\r\n=A.= AMARYLLEÆ have bulbs and the leaves generally arranged in two\r\nrows; the flowers are borne singly or in umbel-like inflorescences\r\non lateral scapes, while the main axis of the bulb is unlimited.\r\nBeneath the inflorescence is an _involucre_ (Fig. 309).--_Galanthus_,\r\nSnowdrop, has a polyphyllous perianth without corona; the three inner\r\nperianth-leaves are emarginate and shorter than the outer; the anthers\r\ndehisce apically. ~_Leucojum_ differs in having the perianth-leaves\r\nequal in length.--_Amaryllis_ has a funnel-shaped perianth, entirely\r\nor nearly polyphyllous, but somewhat zygomorphic. _Crinum; Hæmanthus;\r\nClivia._~--_Narcissus_ has a tubular _corona_, a ligular structure\r\narising from the perianth-tube exterior to the outer stamens. ~In\r\n_Pancratium_ (Fig. 309) the corona is united with the filaments which\r\nappear to spring from its edge. _Eucharis amazonica._~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 309.--_Pancratium caribæum._]\r\n\r\n   =B.= HYPOXIDEÆ. The leaves, which are grass-like, dry, folded,\r\n   and in some hairy, spring from a rhizome, generally with a\r\n   divergence of 1/3. Flowers small, perianth polyphyllous,\r\n   persistent, on which account perhaps the Hypoxideæ may be\r\n   considered as the least altered type. The chief characteristic\r\n   is that the embryo is separated from the hilum. _Hypoxis_;\r\n   _Curculigo_ (_C. recurvata_, a favourite ornamental plant; S.E.\r\n   Asia).\r\n\r\n   =C.= ALSTRŒMERIEÆ. (_Alstrœmeria_, _Bomarea_); stems long,\r\n   leafy, often climbing.\r\n\r\n   =D.= VELLOSIEÆ (_Vellosia_, _Barbacenia_); stem woody, usually\r\n   dichotomously branched, with terminal, single flowers; it bears\r\n   numerous aerial roots which pierce the leaves and surround the\r\n   stem. Stamens often (by splitting) 6–18. High table-lands of S.\r\n   America and S. Africa.\r\n\r\n   =E.= AGAVEÆ. Very similar to the Bromeliaceæ both in their\r\n   distribution (nearly all American) and in external appearance.\r\n   They appear as gigantic bulbous plants with perennial, aerial,\r\n   generally short stem, and perennial, large, lanceolate or\r\n   linear, stiff, thick, and often thorny leaves, which form a\r\n   large rosette; after the course of several (8–20) years the\r\n   terminal inflorescence is developed, which is 10–12 m. high,\r\n   paniculate, and freely branched. Before the inflorescence\r\n   expands, a large quantity of sugar-containing sap is collected\r\n   from _A. americana_ by removing the terminal bud; this on\r\n   distillation yields “pulque,” the national drink of Mexico.\r\n   After flowering the entire shoot dies, but the subterranean\r\n   lateral shoots survive and reproduce the plant.--_Agave\r\n   americana_, etc.; _Fourcroya_; _Polianthes tuberosa_ (Tuberose;\r\n   Central America).\r\n\r\n   DISTRIBUTION. The 650 species are chiefly natives of S. Africa\r\n   and S. America. _Clivia_, _Hæmanthus_, _Amaryllis_ are from the\r\n   Cape; _Narcissus_ from S. Europe, whence many species have been\r\n   introduced; _Galanthus_ and _Leucojum_ are especially from S.\r\n   and Central Europe, and from the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n   USES, few, except as ornamental plants: _Galanthus nivalis_;\r\n   _Leucojum_; _Narcissus pseudonarcissus_, _N. poeticus_, _N.\r\n   jonquilla_, _N. tazetta_, etc.; _Amaryllis_, _Alstrœmeria_,\r\n   _Eucharis_, _Crinum_, _Vallota_, etc. The vascular bundles of\r\n   the various species of _Agave_ (_Agave rigida_, var. _sisalana_,\r\n   sisal hemp,) are used for cordage, etc.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Bromeliaceæ.= The flowers are hypogynous, epigynous or\r\nsemi-epigynous; the perianth is divided into _calyx_ and _corolla_;\r\nstamens 6. The fruit is a capsule or berry with many seeds. Endosperm\r\n_mealy_, embryo small, at the edge of the endosperm, but not enclosed\r\nby it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 310.--_Aechmea miniata._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 311.--Multiple-fruit of _Ananassa sativa_.]\r\n\r\nPerennial herbs with a very _characteristic appearance_ (Fig. 310);\r\nthe stem is most often short, thick, and crowned by a _rosette_ of\r\nmany leaves, which are long, often very narrow, _leathery_, stiff, and\r\nwith a _spiny_ edge; they are usually channeled, completely closing\r\nround each other, with their edges forming a tightly closed hollow, in\r\nwhich generally water is collected (this among other things insulates\r\nthe inflorescence and thus prevents the access of creeping insects,\r\nsuch as ants). The presence of numerous stellate, water-containing\r\nhairs often gives the leaves a grey appearance, and the layers of\r\ncells beneath the upper epidermis of the lamina form an “aqueous\r\ntissue,” which serves as a protection against the rays of the sun and\r\nregulates the evaporation. The stomata are often situated in furrows\r\non the underside of the leaf, and hence cause a striped appearance.\r\nThey _are all American_ (525 species), especially from S. America,\r\nwhere they live partly as epiphytes _on trees_, partly in the _clefts\r\nof rocks_, often on the steepest slopes, to which they firmly attach\r\nthemselves by aerial roots; some are terrestrial. The stem is seldom\r\ntree-like or many metres in height (_Puya_, in Chili; _Hechtia_, in\r\nMexico). _The inflorescence_ is a terminal spike, raceme, or panicle,\r\noften with large and brightly-coloured floral-leaves. The flowers are\r\nwithout scent. The seeds, in the species whose fruit is a capsule,\r\nare often provided with wings (hairs, expansions, etc).--_Ananassa\r\nsativa_, Pine-apple (W. Indies, Central America) is cultivated for the\r\nsake of its juicy, aromatic fruits, which coalesce with their fleshy\r\nbracts and form a large spike-like fruit-cluster (multiple-fruits,[29]\r\nFig. 311) bearing on its apex a leafy shoot, which may be used as a\r\ncutting. Seeds very rarely developed.--_Tillandsia_ (_T. usneoides_ is\r\na filamentous, richly branched, rootless epiphyte hanging in masses\r\nfrom trees; Trop. Am.), _Aechmea_, _Billbergia_, _Pitcairnia_, etc.\r\n\r\n   USES. The leaves of the Pine-apple, in its native country, are\r\n   used for the manufacture of cloth.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Hæmodoraceæ.= 120 species; in all parts of the world\r\n   except Europe; perennial, often tomentose and resembling\r\n   the Bromeliaceæ, Iridaceæ and Amaryllidaceæ. _Hæmodorum_\r\n   (Australia).--To this order belong _Ophiopogon_, _Peliosanthes_,\r\n   _Sanseviera_, and others.\r\n\r\nOrder 8. The =Iridaceæ= have _epigynous_, hermaphrodite flowers with\r\npetaloid perianth as in the Amaryllidaceæ, but the _interior whorl of\r\nstamens is entirely suppressed_, and the 3 developed _outer_ stamens\r\nhave _extrorse_ anthers (Fig. 279); there is 1 style with 3 large,\r\ngenerally _more or less leaf-like branches bearing the stigmas_.\r\nOvary and capsule as in the Amaryllidaceæ and Liliaceæ.--Perennial\r\nherbs; _bulbs are rarely found_, but horizontal rhizomes, corms, etc.,\r\ntake their place. The leaves are (except _Crocus_) as in the _Iris_,\r\n_two-rowed_, _equitant_ and _sword-like_. Flowers or inflorescences\r\nterminal.\r\n\r\nThe _Iris_ (Flag) has a horizontal rhizome. The flowers are borne in\r\nthe leaf-axils in fan-like inflorescences (rhipidium). The branches of\r\nthe style are large and _petaloid_; on their under surface may be seen\r\na small projecting shelf (Fig. 312 _a_) having on its upper surface the\r\nstigmatic hairs. Beneath the branches of the style are 3 well protected\r\nstamens, and immediately outside these the external perianth-leaves.\r\n~The honey is secreted in the perianth-tube, and the insects,\r\nendeavouring to obtain it through the narrow passages at the base of\r\nthe stamens, settle upon the outer perianth-leaves, which are bent\r\nbackwards and often very hairy along their central line. The insects\r\nthen rub their backs on the anthers just above them, beneath the\r\nbranches of the style; they readily deposit the pollen on the stigma\r\nof another flower as they enter it, but cannot do so in withdrawing,\r\nsince the stigma is pushed back, and self-fertilisation is thus\r\navoided. The stylar branches lie close to the outer perianth-leaves,\r\nwhich are just beneath them, or separated by a distance of only 6–10\r\nmm.; the first form of flower is adapted for _Rhingia rostrata_, the\r\nlatter for bees~.--_Crocus_ has vertical, _tuberous_, underground stems\r\nsurrounded by the leaf-sheaths (corms), and terminal flowers; the\r\nlinear leaves _are not equitant_, but have two longitudinal furrows\r\non the under side. The perianth is gamophyllous and funnel-shaped.\r\nThe stylar branches (stigmas) are fleshy, _rolled together in the\r\nshape of a horn_, and split along the edge.--_Gladiolus_ has corms\r\nlike the _Crocus_; spikes with slightly zygomorphic, almost bilabiate\r\nflowers, most frequently turning to one side. Position of the leaves\r\nas in the Iris.--~_Diplarrhena_ has 2 fertile and 1 barren stamen;\r\n_Hermodactylus_ has a unilocular ovary with 3 parietal placentæ.\r\n_Cypella_ and _Tigridia_ have bulbs.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 312.--_Iris pseudacorus._ One external and\r\n  two internal perianth-leaves, and one of the stylar-branches\r\n  have been removed, _y_ The outer, _i_ the inner perianth-leaves;\r\n  _g_ stylar-branch; _a_ stigma; _s_ anther. The ovary is seen in\r\n  longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n   770 species; chiefly in the countries round the Mediterranean,\r\n   and in Africa, especially the Cape (_Gladiolus_, _Ferraria_,\r\n   _Moræa_, _Galaxia_, _Sparaxis_, _Antholyza_, _Tritonia_,\r\n   _Ixia_, etc.), Australia and Tropical America (_Sisyrinchium_,\r\n   _Tigridia_, _Cipura_, _Cypella_, etc). A great number are\r\n   ornamental plants: the cultivated _Crocus_-species are from the\r\n   South of Europe and Asia; _Gladiolus communis_ from S. Europe;\r\n   the other species principally from S. Africa. The native species\r\n   of _Iris_ are _I. pseudacorus_ (yellow) and _I. fœtidissima_.\r\n\r\n   OFFICINAL: the stigmas of _Crocus sativus_ (Oriental, cultivated\r\n   in France, Spain, Italy, and Austria), used as a colouring\r\n   matter, saffron; the rhizomes of the S. European _Iris\r\n   florentina_, _pallida_, and _germanica_ (“Orris-root”).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 313.--_Dioscorea batatas_: _A_ ♂-plant; _B_\r\n  ♂-flower; _C_ ♀-plant (nat. size); _D_, _E_ ♀-flowers (mag.); _F_\r\n  seed; _G_ embryo.]\r\n\r\nOrder 9. =Dioscoreaceæ.= Perennial herbs with fleshy, often very large\r\n_tuberous rhizomes_ (or roots); _twining_ stems; leaves stalked, often\r\narrow- or heart-shaped, lobed, _palminerved_ and _finely reticulate_\r\nas in the Dicotyledons (Fig. 313). The flower is _diclinous_ (most\r\nfrequently _diœcious_), regular, _epigynous_, _small_, and of a\r\n_greenish colour_, but otherwise typical (Pr3 + 3, and A3 + 3, or G3);\r\nin most instances 2 ovules are placed one above the other in each\r\nloculus. The inflorescence is a _spike_ or _raceme_, sometimes richly\r\nbranched and paniculate.--The order approaches most nearly to the\r\nAmaryllidaceæ.\r\n\r\n_Tamus_ (Bryony) has a berry, _Dioscorea_ (Yam) a thin-walled, 3-edged\r\nor 3-winged capsule (Fig. 313). Both have subterranean or aerial\r\ntubers; the Yam very often also developes tubers in the axils of the\r\nfoliage-leaves; tuberous roots are said to occur in _D. batatas_.\r\nThe tubers of many species of Yams (_D. batatas_ from China and\r\nJapan, _D. alata_, South Sea Islands and India, _D. bulbifera_) are\r\na very important source of food in the Tropics, especially the\r\nfirst-named.--_Testudinaria_; _Rajania_.--~The tuberous stem of\r\n_Tamus communis_ and _Testudinaria elephantipes_, and some species\r\nof _Dioscorea_ is formed from one single internode (epicotyl), and\r\nthe aerial shoots are developed from adventitious buds; in _T.\r\nelephantipes_ the stem is aerial, and covered with thick scales of\r\ncork, regularly arranged, and separated by grooves.~\r\n\r\n   Tropical order (167 species); 2 species (_Tamus communis_ and\r\n   _Borderea pyrenaica_) in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 6. =Scitamineæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers belong to the ordinary monocotyledonous type. They are\r\nhermaphrodite, _epigynous_, and have either a petaloid perianth, or\r\ncalyx and corolla; they are, however, _zygomorphic_ or _unsymmetrical_,\r\nand of the stamens most frequently only one is _completely developed_,\r\nthe others being generally represented by petaloid staminodes. The\r\novary has 3 loculi, more rarely it is unilocular with the suppression\r\nof 2 loculi. Endosperm is absent (except _Zingiberaceæ_); but, on the\r\nother hand, there is a _large perisperm_. To this family belong large,\r\nglabrous, especially _perennial herbs_ with rhizomes; leaves large,\r\ndistinctly divided into sheath, stalk, and blade, the latter being more\r\nor less elliptical or lanceolate, entire, with pinnate venation, and\r\nalways with a very _well-pronounced midrib_, gradually tapering towards\r\nthe apex, and giving off numerous branches, which run outwards, towards\r\nthe margin, at a larger or smaller angle; these _lateral veins_ are\r\nclosely packed, and parallel, but with only weak, connecting branches\r\nbetween them; the leaves, therefore, are easily torn pinnately (Figs.\r\n314, 317). The leaf-sheaths close tightly round each other and form a\r\nfalse stem.\r\n\r\nThis very natural family comprises orders closely connected with each\r\nother, but is not itself nearly allied to any other family. First in\r\nthe series stands:--\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Musaceæ.= The _petaloid_ perianth is strongly zygomorphic,\r\nthe anterior leaf being very large (a kind of “labellum”), the\r\nposterior one small; only the posterior stamen is wanting, or is\r\nrudimentary, the other five are developed, and have quadrilocular\r\nanthers; ovary, 3-locular. Seed with straight embryo in mealy perisperm.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 314.--Two _Musa_-species.]\r\n\r\nThe best-known genus is _Musa_, the Banana (Fig. 314). From the\r\nshort rhizome arise enormously large, spirally-placed leaves, whose\r\nsheaths envelope one another, and form an apparently aerial stem,\r\nseveral metres in height. The inflorescence is a terminal _spike_\r\nwith floral-leaves placed spirally, and sometimes magnificently\r\ncoloured; in the axils of each of these several flowers are situated\r\nin two transverse rows (accessory buds); the lowest flowers in the\r\ninflorescence are ♀, the central ones ☿, the upper ones ♂, so that\r\nfruits are only found in the lower region of the inflorescence, the\r\nremaining portion persisting as a naked axis after the floral-leaves\r\nand flowers have fallen off; the inflorescence terminates in an ovoid\r\nbud formed by the flowers which have not yet opened (Fig. 314, the\r\nleft-hand figure). The perianth-leaves are united (except the posterior\r\none). The fruit (known as a “Banana”) is a _berry_, having the form of\r\na smooth, short, three-cornered Cucumber (as much as 30 cm. in length);\r\ninside the tough skin is found a farinaceous, aromatic pulp. No seed\r\nis developed in the cultivated species.--~Several _Musa_-species are\r\ncultivated in the Tropics for the sake of the fruit (_M. paradisiaca_,\r\n_M. sapientum_); for the fibrovascular bundles, _M. textilis_ (Manilla\r\nHemp).--Their home is, no doubt, the Tropics of the Old World; they\r\nwere introduced into America before the arrival of Europeans. _Musa\r\nensete_ has dry, leathery fruits; an ornamental plant.~\r\n\r\n   In _Musa_ the barren, posterior stamen belongs to the inner\r\n   whorl; and also in _Strelitzia_ and _Ravenala_; the latter\r\n   may have all 6 stamens developed. In _Heliconia_, on the\r\n   contrary, it belongs to the outer whorl; in _Heliconia_ the\r\n   perianth-leaves are differently arranged, and there is only\r\n   one ovule in each loculus. The three latter genera have dry\r\n   fruits and leaves arranged in two rows. In the “Travellers’\r\n   Palm” (_Ravenala madagascariensis_) the foliage-leaves form an\r\n   enormous fan.--Tropical; about 50 species.\r\n\r\nThe order may be divided as follows:--1. Museæ: _Musa_, _Ravenala_,\r\n_Strelitzia_ in the Old World. 2. Heliconiæ: _Heliconia_ in the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 315.--Diagram of a _Zingiberaceous_ flower\r\n  (_Kæmpferia ovalifolia_): _b_ bract; _v_ bracteole; _k_ calyx;\r\n  _p^1_, _p^2_, _p^3_ the petals; _sst_, lateral staminodes\r\n  (“wings”); _lab_ labellum (formed of two staminodes); _st_ the\r\n  fertile stamen; * position of suppressed stamen. The ovary is in\r\n  the centre of the diagram.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Zingiberaceæ.= Perianth most frequently divided into _calyx_\r\nand _corolla_. Calyx gamosepalous. Only 1 _fertile stamen_ (the\r\nposterior, Fig. 315, belonging to the inner whorl) with quadrilocular\r\nanther, which encloses the style in a furrow; the 2 stamens in the\r\nouter whorl are staminodes, the median one (the anterior) is wanting.\r\nThe 2 lateral staminodes of the inner whorl form the “labellum” (Fig.\r\n315 _lab_), which usually is the largest segment of the flower, and\r\nis often bilobed. Ovules many. The fruit in some is a leathery,\r\n3-valved capsule, with loculicidal dehiscence; in others it is more or\r\nless berry-like and indehiscent, or irregularly dehiscent. Straight\r\nembryo.--The aerial stem is seldom developed to any extent, and the\r\ninflorescences, which are (compound) spikes or racemes, often with\r\ncoloured floral-leaves, spring in some (_e.g. Zingiber officinale_)\r\ndirectly from the rhizome. The leaves are arranged in two rows.--The\r\novary in a few instances (_Globba_ and others) is unilocular, with 3\r\nparietal placentæ.\r\n\r\n   They are perennial herbs with fleshy and tuberous rhizomes,\r\n   which are used as condiments and in medicine on account of their\r\n   pungent and aromatic properties and also for starch, dyes, etc.\r\n   OFFICINAL: _rhizomes_ of _Zingiber officinale_ (Ginger, unknown\r\n   wild, but cultivated generally in the Tropics), of _Curcuma\r\n   longa_ (Turmeric, a dye, E. India) and _C. zedoaria_, of _C.\r\n   angustifolia_ and others (as E. India Arrowroot), of _Alpinia\r\n   officinarum_, China (galangal). “Preserved Ginger” from _Alpinia\r\n   galanga_. Similar aromatic materials (volatile oils) are present\r\n   also, for example, in _the fruits_; Cardamom fruits and seeds\r\n   (from _Elettaria cardamomum_, China, seldom from _E. major_).\r\n\r\n   315 species; Tropics, preponderating in the Eastern Hemisphere,\r\n   India, and especially S. Asia, whence all the aromatic\r\n   species originate; they are now commonly cultivated in the\r\n   Tropics. Some are ornamental plants in greenhouses, _e.g._\r\n   _Hedychium_, _Costus_, etc. _Globba_ (with axillary buds in the\r\n   inflorescence, as in _Ficaria_), _Renealmia_, _Kæmpferia_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 316.--Flower of _Canna_: _f_ ovary; _pa_\r\n  calyx; _pi_ corolla; _l_ labellum; _st_ stamens; _an_ anther; _g_\r\n  stigma; α and β staminodes.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Cannaceæ.= American herbs without aromatic properties.\r\nFlowers asymmetric (Fig. 316). Calyx polysepalous. The stamens are\r\n_petaloid_ (Fig. 316 _st_) and barren with the exception of one (the\r\nposterior), which bears on one of its _edges_ a bilocular anther;\r\nanother, which is especially large and coloured, is termed the\r\n_labellum_. The style is compressed and leaf-like, with a small stigma\r\nat the apex. Ovules numerous in the 3 loculi. The capsule is furnished\r\nwith warts or soft prickles. _Embryo straight._\r\n\r\n_Canna_ (30 species; Trop. Am.). The inflorescence is a terminal\r\nspike with 2-flowered unipared scorpioid cymes in the axils of the\r\nfloral-leaves. Ornamental plants: _Canna indica_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe diagram of the andrœcium of the Cannaceæ and Marantaceæ may be\r\nrepresented in the following manner (calyx, corolla and gynœceum being\r\nomitted):--\r\n\r\n        CANNACEÆ.

Only 1 or 2 of the\r\n3 stamens in the outer whorl are present as staminodes; in the inner\r\nwhorl 2 are petaloid and of the sixth stamen one-half is developed as a\r\nstaminode and the other half bears a bilocular anther. One ovule only\r\nin each loculus. The style is strongly curved and at first enclosed\r\nin one of the staminodes (hood) of the inner whorl; later on it\r\nsprings elastically forward towards the other staminode (inner-wing)\r\nof the same whorl. The stigma is very oblique or 2-lipped. Two of the\r\nthree loculi of the ovary, in some (_Maranta_, _Thalia_) become small\r\nand empty. Embryo _curved_. Leaves in two rows, with sheath, stalk,\r\nand blade (Fig. 317); at the base of the last is a _characteristic\r\nswelling_ (_articulus_).--~_Phrynium_, _Calathea_, _Stromanthe_,\r\n_Ctenanthe_, _Saranthe_, etc. About 150 species; tropical, especially\r\nAmerica. The starch of the rhizome of _Maranta arundinacea_ is\r\nOFFICINAL, “West Indian Arrowroot.”~\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Family 7. =Gynandræ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers are hermaphrodite and constructed on the ordinary 3-merous,\r\npentacyclic type with petaloid, _epigynous, strongly zygomorphic_\r\nperianth, and generally _one-stamened_ by the suppression of the\r\nother 5 stamens. The family has derived its name from the fact that\r\nthe stamen is united with the style into a “_stylar column_” (except\r\n_Burmanniaceæ_). All are herbs; many grow as epiphytes on other plants.\r\n\r\n   This family and the Scitamineæ occupy correspondingly high\r\n   positions among the Monocotyledons; these two families may\r\n   therefore be placed close together, although one cannot be\r\n   derived from the other. The first of the two orders is very\r\n   small, but the second is very rich in species. The Apostasieæ\r\n   are best classed with the Orchidaceæ and have no independent\r\n   place.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Burmanniaceæ.= This order forms a transitional link between\r\nthe Gynandræ and the epigynous Liliifloræ (_Amaryllidaceæ_), in having\r\na 6-leaved perianth, and 6–8 stamens; but some have a labiate perianth\r\n(the median perianth-leaf of the _outer_ whorl being very large). The\r\novary is most frequently unilocular with three parietal placentæ; but\r\nin some it is 3-locular with axile placentation. Capsule. Seeds ∞,\r\nsmall, with _endosperm_. The relationship to the Orchidaceæ is shown\r\nespecially in the very imperfectly developed embryo and in the ovary.\r\nSmall, tropical herbs (59 species); some are saprophytes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 318.--_A_ Diagram of an Orchid-flower. _B_,\r\n  _Cephalanthera_. Stylar-column: _a_ anther; _s_ stigma; at the\r\n  foot are seen scars indicating the position of the parts which\r\n  have been removed.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Orchidaceæ.= The epigynous, petaloid perianth is strongly\r\nzygomorphic in having the _posterior_ leaf of the interior whorl, the\r\n_lip_ (labellum), differing from all the other leaves in form, size,\r\nand colour (except _Apostasieæ_); the position of the labellum is very\r\nfrequently reversed, being turned _forwards and downwards_ by the\r\ntwisting of the ovary (Fig. 318 _A_). _Only_ 1 of the stamens--the\r\nanterior of the external whorl--is developed and bears an anther (by\r\nthe twisting of the ovary it is turned posteriorly and upwards);\r\nthe others are entirely wanting (indicated by * in Fig. 318 _A_)\r\nor present as staminodes (Fig. 318 _A_, δ δ) (except _Apostasieæ_,\r\n_Cypripedileæ_); the filaments are united with the style to form a\r\ncolumn (Fig. 318 _B_), the _stylar-column_[30] (_gynostemium_), and\r\nthe anther (_a_) is thus placed on its apex and exactly behind or over\r\nthe stigma (_s_). The anther is 4-locular; the pollen-grains do not\r\nseparate (except _Apostasieæ_, _Cypripedileæ_) but remain united either\r\nin tetrads or in masses, which correspond to a pollen-mother-cell\r\n(Fig. 320 _C_, _D_, _E_); or the pollen-grains, formed in each of\r\nthe two anther-halves, remain united and form one or a few wax-like\r\nmasses (pollen-masses, pollinia). The 3 carpels form a _unilocular\r\novary_ with 3 parietal, deeply bifid placentæ (except _Apostasieæ_,\r\n_Selenipedilum_). Only the two lateral carpels are prolonged and\r\ndeveloped into the stigma (Fig. 318 _B_, _s_), while the one lying in\r\nthe median line, which is situated just within the anther (Fig. 318\r\n_A_), becomes either rudimentary or developed into the “_rostellum_”\r\n(“a small beak”), on which the sticky bodies (_glandulæ_) arise; by\r\naid of these the heavy, connected pollen-masses may be glued to the\r\ninsects which visit the flower, and pollination is thus secured (in\r\n_Apostasieæ_ and _Cypripedileæ_ the 3 carpels each contribute to the\r\nformation of the stigma). The fruit is a _capsule_ which most often\r\ndehisces _by 6 valves_, 3 of which are broader and bear the placentæ,\r\nand 3 alternating with them are narrower and barren (except _Vanilla_).\r\nThe very numerous and exceedingly small seeds have _no endosperm_,\r\nand have a somewhat _spherical embryo without any trace of external\r\norgans_. The testa is membranous and loose.\r\n\r\nThe Orchids are _all perennial herbs_ with diverse habits and varying\r\nmorphological structure (see the genera); the leaves are scattered,\r\nof the usual Liliaceous form, and the inflorescences in all cases are\r\n_racemes or spikes_ (sometimes branched), with subtending bracts, but\r\nwithout bracteoles.\r\n\r\nThe forms which are the least modified are described first.\r\n\r\n=1.= APOSTASIEÆ. The perianth-leaves are almost alike and free. The\r\ncolumn is straight, with 3 equally-developed stigmas. _Neuwiedia_ has\r\n3 perfect stamens (1 median of the outer whorl, and 2 lateral of the\r\ninner whorl); _Apostasia_ has only 2 perfect (inner lateral) and one\r\nbarren (the median of the outer whorl), which however may be entirely\r\nwanting. The 3 _posterior_ stamens are entirely suppressed. The pollen\r\nis powdery. The ovary is 3-locular with axile placenta. 7 species\r\n(Tropical East India, Australia).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 319.--_Cypripedilum calceolus_: 1 front view\r\n  of the flower; 2 lateral view, after the removal of all the\r\n  perianth-leaves with the exception of the labellum, which has\r\n  been divided longitudinally; 3 the stylar-column; _ov_ ovary;\r\n  _s_-_s_ exterior, _p_ interior perianth; _p’_ the labellum; _a_\r\n  the two fertile stamens; _a’_ the staminode; _st_ the stigma; _i_\r\n  entrance for the insects; _ex_ exit.]\r\n\r\n=2.= CYPRIPEDILEÆ.[31] The flower is strongly zygomorphic with a large\r\nboat-shaped labellum. There are two perfect stamens belonging to the\r\n_inner_ whorl, and the median anterior (later on the posterior) stamen\r\nof the outer whorl is transformed into a large, barren, shield-shaped\r\nbody (Fig. 319). _Selenipedilum_ has a 3-locular ovary, but\r\n_Cypripedilum_ (Ladies’-slipper) has a unilocular ovary with 3 parietal\r\nplacentæ--the typical structure for the Orchids. The pollen-grains\r\nare _separate_ (not in tetrads) and all the 3 lobes of the stigma are\r\nconstructed to receive them. This group is therefore, next to the\r\nApostasieæ, the least modified among the Orchids; in all the following\r\ngroups, one of the lobes of the stigma is differently developed from\r\nthe others, and there is only one stamen.--Terrestial Orchids.--~The\r\npollination of _C. calceolus_ is effected by the forcible entrance of\r\ninsects into the boat-shaped labellum (Fig. 319 _p’_) at _i_, and their\r\nescape at _ex_ (in 2) where the anthers are situated; in this way the\r\nstigmas will first be touched and then the anthers. The pollen-grains\r\nare surrounded by a sticky mass in order that they may adhere to the\r\ninsects.~\r\n\r\n=3.= NEOTTIEÆ. The majority are terrestrial Orchids with creeping,\r\nsympodial rhizomes; the blades of the leaves are not detached from the\r\nstem at joints, and have convolute vernation. The anthers do not drop\r\noff, but persist in the withered condition; their _apex_ is brought\r\nin contact with the rostellum (acrotonous Orchids). The pollen-grains\r\nare united in _tetrads_, which, however, often hang loosely together\r\nin pollinia, attached to a sticky part of the rostellum (“adhesive\r\ndisc”), so that they adhere to the insects, and are by them transferred\r\nto the stigmas. _Spiranthes. Listera_; _Neottia_. ~_N. nidus-avis_\r\n(Bird’s-nest) is brown (it has little chlorophyll) in colour, has\r\nno foliage-leaves, and lives mainly as a saprophyte; the rhizome\r\nis studded with unbranched, fleshy roots which may form buds at\r\ntheir extremities.~--_Vanilla_ climbs by aerial roots. The fruit\r\nis fleshy and hardly opens, or does so irregularly.--_Epipactis_,\r\n_Cephalanthera_.--_Epipogon_ and _Limodorum_ are saprophytes without\r\nchlorophyll.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 320.--A Flower of _Orchis maculata_ (front\r\n  view): a stamen; _b_ the cup; _n_ the stigmas; _x_ staminodes;\r\n  _sp_ the spur; _spe_ the entrance to it; _sm_-_sl_-_sl_ exterior\r\n  perianth-leaves; _pm_ the labellum, and _pl_-_pl_ the other 2\r\n  interior perianth-leaves. _B-E Orchis mascula_: _B_ lateral\r\n  view of the column; _C_ a pollinium with massulæ (_p_), caudicle\r\n  (_c_) and adhesive disc (_d_); _D_ caudicles with the cup (_r_),\r\n  front view; the latter is depressed so that the adhesive disc is\r\n  seen lying inside it; _E_ a pollinium, more highly magnified;\r\n  some massulæ are removed. _F Ophrys aranifera_: rostellum and\r\n  the base of the anther-loculus; an adhesive disc is seen on the\r\n  right.]\r\n\r\n=4.= OPHRYDEÆ. Anthers 2-locular, not falling off, on a very short\r\ncolumn. The anther is united at _its base_ with the rostellum\r\n(_basitonous_ Orchids, Fig. 320 _A_, _B_), while in all other Orchids\r\nit is connected at the apex (acrotonous Orchids). The pollen-grains\r\nin each loculus are united into small “masses” (massulæ), each of\r\nwhich corresponds to a pollen-mother-cell in the anther, and which\r\nhang together by elastic threads (Fig. 320 _C_, _E_). Each pollinium\r\nis attached at the base by a stalk (caudicle) to an adhesive disc,\r\nformed by the modified stigma (rostellum), and is easily liberated\r\nfrom it (Fig. 320 _C_, _D_, _F_). The pollinium, which is formed in\r\nan anther-loculus, together with its caudicle and adhesive disc, is\r\ntermed “pollinarium” (Fig. 320 _C_).--All Ophrydeæ are terrestrial with\r\n_tuberous roots_, two of which are present in the flowering period, an\r\nolder one (from the preceding year) containing the nourishment for\r\nthe flowering-shoot of the year, and a young one which is intended to\r\ncontain the reserve material for the following year. Inflorescence\r\nterminal.\r\n\r\n_Orchis._ The lip has a spur; each of the club-like pollinia is\r\nattached to its own adhesive disc, the discs being enclosed in a common\r\npouch formed by the rostellum (Fig. 320 _C_, _D_). ~Tubers ovate,\r\nundivided: _O. morio_, _mascula_; tubers palmate: _O. incarnata_,\r\n_maculata_, _majalis_.~--_Ophrys_; no spur, the two adhesive discs\r\nare each enclosed in a separate pouch (Fig. 320 _F_).--_Anacamptis_\r\nand _Serapias_ have one adhesive disc.--_Habenaria_, _Gymnadenia_,\r\n_Platanthera_, _Herminium_, _Nigritella_, _Cœloglossum_, etc., have\r\nnaked adhesive discs (no rostellum).\r\n\r\n   =5.= EPIDENDREÆ. Acrotonous Orchids with deciduous anthers\r\n   (except _Malaxis_); 2-8 wax-like pollinia, with or without\r\n   caudicles; generally no adhesive discs. _Malaxis_ (the flower is\r\n   twisted through a complete circle, causing the labellum to be\r\n   turned upwards), _Sturmia_ and _Corallorhiza_[32] (Coral-root);\r\n   the latter has a creeping, coral-like rhizome _without roots,\r\n   and is destitute of chlorophyll_ except in the ovary. The\r\n   other two somewhat resemble the tropical Orchids in having the\r\n   lower internodes of the axis of the inflorescence tuberous.\r\n   _Liparis_; _Calypso_. Most of the genera are tropical epiphytes\r\n   and many have aerial, green tubers formed from one or more\r\n   stem-internodes; _Dendrobium_, _Eria_, _Phaius_, _Bletia_,\r\n   _Epidendrum_, _Cattleya_, _Lælia_, _Pleurothallis_, _Restrepia_,\r\n   _Masdevallia_, _Bulbophyllum_, etc.\r\n\r\n   =6.= VANDEÆ. These resemble the preceding but have only 2\r\n   wax-like pollinia in each anther, which are attached by a\r\n   caudicle to the adhesive disc of the rostellum. Nearly all are\r\n   tropical epiphytes. _Stanhopea_, _Catasetum_, _Maxillaria_,\r\n   _Oncidium_, _Vanda_, _Polystachya_, etc.\r\n\r\n   6,000 (10,000?) species. The majority live in the Tropics and\r\n   occur, especially, as epiphytes on trees or in the crevices of\r\n   rocks, to which they are attached by aerial roots. These _aerial\r\n   roots_, like those of Araceæ, are covered by several layers of\r\n   spirally-thickened cells (tracheides) which contain air and form\r\n   the velamen--an apparatus to absorb moisture from the air. The\r\n   roots have a white appearance when the cells are filled with\r\n   air, which changes to a greenish hue when they are filled with\r\n   water, the chlorophyll then shining through. They generally\r\n   have horizontal rhizomes; the ascending shoots, which bear the\r\n   foliage-leaves, may vary, but they very often swell and assume\r\n   the form of a tuber, which persists for several years fresh and\r\n   green after the leaves have fallen off (Fig. 321). _Vanilla_\r\n   is an exception (see above). Our Orchids are all terrestrial\r\n   (or marsh-plants); the largest number of species is found in\r\n   calcareous soils.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION takes place principally by means of insects,\r\n   but self-pollination occurs in some. The lip serves as a\r\n   landing-stage for the insect visitors, which, on sucking the\r\n   honey, cause the adhesive discs, with the pollinia attached to\r\n   them, to adhere to their bodies (generally to the probosces)\r\n   and so carry them away to other flowers. In some species parts\r\n   of the flower are sensitive or irritable, which has some\r\n   connection with the pollination. Without doubt there are a great\r\n   many biological differences which are closely connected with\r\n   the infinite multiplicity of forms; Darwin (1862) has already\r\n   shown an enormous variety, never even dreamt of before, in the\r\n   European species. The genus _Catasetum_ has ♂-♀-and ☿-plants\r\n   with flowers of such different appearances that they have\r\n   been classed in various genera (_Myanthus_, _Monacanthus_).\r\n   _Platanthera_ is pollinated by hawk-moths; _Ophrys_, by flies;\r\n   _Epipactis latifolia_, by wasps; _Orchis_, by bees, especially\r\n   humble-bees, etc.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 321.--_Chysis bractescens._]\r\n\r\n   The DISTRIBUTION OF SEEDS is effected by the wind, the seeds\r\n   being so exceedingly small and light. Many species moreover have\r\n   peculiar, elater-like, fine, hygroscopic hairs in the ovary,\r\n   which eject the seeds in a manner similar to the elaters of the\r\n   Liverworts.\r\n\r\n   The USES are few, mostly as ornamental plants in conservatories.\r\n   The tubers of several _Orchis_-species are OFFICINAL; they\r\n   contain starch and mucilage and are used us “salep.” The fruits\r\n   of _Vanilla planifolia_ are used as condiments and differ from\r\n   other _Orchid_-fruits in being rather fleshy and in dehiscing\r\n   irregularly; the seeds are very small, shining and black.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Class II. =Dicotyledones.=\r\n\r\nIn this class THE EMBRYO has 2 seed-leaves, a rule from which there are\r\nfew exceptions (_e.g. Ficaria_, _Cyclamen_, _Pinguicula_, certain\r\nspecies of _Corydalis_, with only 1; and a few, mostly parasitic\r\nforms, _e.g. Monotropa_, _Orobanche_, _Pyrola_, entirely without\r\ncotyledons). On germination the cotyledons nearly always raise\r\nthemselves above the ground as green, assimilating leaves and are then\r\ntermed aerial or epigean, in contradistinction to the underground or\r\nhypogean which are always buried. The structure of the seed varies\r\n(endospermous or exendospermous); the embryo may be straight or curved.\r\nIn many instances the primary root grows as a vigorous tap-root,\r\nwith weaker branches arising acropetally (in annuals, biennials,\r\nmany perennials, especially woody plants); but in a large number of\r\nherbaceous perennials, which have rhizomes, the root behaves very much\r\nas in the Monocotyledons. The roots generally increase in thickness by\r\nmeans of a cambium.\r\n\r\nTHE STEM, when seen in transverse section, has its vascular bundles\r\narranged in a ring; in reality, however, they form a kind of\r\ncylindrical network in the stem; the bundles are open, and thickening\r\ntakes place by means of a cambium; annual rings are formed in the\r\nperennial stems. There is a rich and very varied form of _branching_.\r\nThe two first leaves of a shoot (fore-leaves) are placed nearly always\r\nto the right and to the left; the same arrangement is found in the two\r\nfirst leaves developed on the flower-stalk, and these are, as a rule,\r\nthe only two; they are found below the calyx and are usually termed the\r\n“_bracteoles_.” It has become customary to indicate the bracteoles by\r\nthe letters α and β, according to their sequence of growth, and in that\r\nsense these letters will be employed in the following diagrams.\r\n\r\nTHE ARRANGEMENT OF THE LEAVES varies very much; there is also a great\r\nvariety of shapes in the leaves and their venation, but the linear\r\nleaves, with parallel venation, so frequent in the Monocotyledons,\r\nare seldom met with, as also the large sheaths (though the sheath is\r\nwell developed in the Umbelliferous plants); stipules occur much more\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWER is most commonly cyclic, but acyclic or hemicyclic forms\r\nalso occur. The type which may be taken as a basis consists in the\r\nmajority of instances, as in the Monocotyledons, of 5 whorls, of which\r\nthe 4 outer ones (calyx, corolla, and the 2 whorls of stamens) are\r\nmost frequently 4 or 5 in number and placed in regular alternation,\r\nwhilst the innermost one (the carpels) has generally fewer members,\r\nprobably on account of space (Figs. 360, 361, 421, 429, 487, etc.).\r\nTrimerous (Figs. 384, 387, etc.) flowers, or those in which the members\r\nof the flower are in threes or a multiple of three, also occur, as well\r\nas dimerous flowers; other numbers are rare. It is of the greatest\r\nimportance in connection with the relative position of the members of\r\nthe flower to the axis and bract (orientation), whether the bracteoles\r\nare typically present (even though they may not be developed), or\r\nare typically absent. If there are 2 bracteoles present, then their\r\nposition in a pentamerous flower is often as follows: the first sepal\r\nturns obliquely forward, the second is posterior and median, the\r\nthird obliquely forward, the fourth and fifth obliquely backward;\r\nquincuncial æstivation is often found in these buds (Figs. 360, 429,\r\n471, 475, 584). The first and third leaves, in the following chapters,\r\nare most frequently alluded to as the “anterior,” the fourth and\r\nfifth as the “lateral” leaves. The _reversed_ arrangement, with the\r\nmedian sepal in the front, occurs for instance in _Papilionaceæ_ (Fig.\r\n511), _Lobeliaceæ_ (Fig. 594), _Rhodoracecæ_. If any bracteoles are\r\npresent below a tetramerous flower, the relation is generally that\r\n2 sepals (the first ones) stand in the median plane, the two next\r\nones transversely (Fig. 393), and the corolla then adopts a diagonal\r\nposition (Fig. 397); but a diagonal position of the calyx generally\r\nshows that the flower is not, strictly speaking, tetramerous, as in\r\n_Plantago_ (Fig. 567), _Veronica_ (Fig. 559 _C_) and others.\r\n\r\nIf the bracteoles are _not_ typically present, then the position of the\r\nsepals is changed accordingly, and the two outer sepals endeavour to\r\nassume the position which the bracteoles would otherwise have occupied,\r\n_e.g._ in _Primula_ (Fig. 547). Other positions are also found when the\r\nnumber of bracteoles is more or less than two.\r\n\r\nThe leaves which follow the sepals occupy definite positions with\r\nregard to them, which we may consider later. An arrangement must,\r\nhowever, be mentioned here; when the flower is “_diplostemonous_” that\r\nis, has two whorls of stamens (thus, Sn, Pn, An + n), these may be\r\narranged in two ways. _Either_ the first-formed whorl of stamens, which\r\nare termed the “calyx-stamens,” stands directly in front of the sepals\r\n(that is “episepalous”), and is the _outermost_ whorl, and in this case\r\na regular alternation takes place between sepals, petals and the two\r\nwhorls of stamens, which is also continued into the carpels if their\r\nnumber is the same as that of the other whorls: the carpels are then\r\nplaced opposite the sepals (Fig. 278) and the flower is _isomerous_\r\nand Gn should be added to the formula above. _Or_, the calyx-stamens\r\nform the _innermost_ whorl, and the corolla-stamens, which are\r\nsubsequently formed (“epipetalous” stamens), stand _outside_ these\r\n(Figs. 360, 429); if the number of carpels is the same as that of the\r\npreceding whorls, they are often placed _right in front_ of the petals\r\nand the corolla-stamens. The first-mentioned arrangement is termed\r\n_Diplostemonous_, and the second _Obdiplostemonous_. ~Both arrangements\r\nmay be found in one and the same order, _e.g._ Caryophyllaceæ. The\r\nsize and relation of the members of the flowers, and also the contact\r\nwith other members in the early stages of their development, play an\r\nimportant part in determining the arrangement.~\r\n\r\nThe great number of structural arrangements found in this enormously\r\nlarge class, may, as is the case in the Monocotyledons, be further\r\nvaried by _suppression and division_ of certain leaves (especially the\r\nstamens). Instances of this will occur in the following (Figs. 559,\r\n568.--426, 441, 445, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe Dicotyledons were formerly divided into 3 sub-classes: Apetalæ\r\n(those without corolla), Sympetalæ or Gamopetalæ (those with the petals\r\nunited), and Choripetalæ or Polypetalæ (the petals not united). This\r\ndivision has now been abandoned because it has been proved that the\r\nApetalæ were merely reduced or incomplete forms of the Choripetalæ, and\r\nthey have therefore been distributed among the various families of the\r\nlatter sub-class.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Sympetalæ (or Gamopetalæ) it may be stated that\r\nthey form to a very great extent a closely connected and natural\r\ngroup, having in common not only the character that the corolla is\r\ngamopetalous and the stamens united with it (this being also found in\r\nthe Choripetalæ), but also a great many others (such as persistent\r\ncalyx, cyclic flowers with the formula S5, P5, A5 and as a rule G2,\r\nthe two carpels being united to form the ovary; seeds with a thick\r\nintegument and a very small nucellus). They are therefore considered\r\nas an independent sub-class, and must be placed at the close of the\r\nsystem of classification as the forms which presumably have arisen the\r\nlatest. In the future systems of classification this arrangement will\r\nvery probably be changed, and the first families of the Sympetalæ, the\r\nBicornes and others will for instance be to a certain extent united\r\nwith the families or orders of the Choripetalæ. The Sympetalæ may\r\ncertainly be considered as the youngest types, the strongly pronounced\r\nmetamorphosis supporting this theory, as also the formation of the\r\nintegument of the ovule, the one thick integument being undoubtedly\r\nderived from the coalescence of two--a holochlamydeous ovule, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Apetalæ and Choripetalæ are united into one sub-class. The leaves\r\nof the perianth in this case are, as a rule, free from each other, the\r\nstructure of the flowers presents many differences, and the ovules have\r\nas a rule 2 integuments and a large nucellus. Considerable uncertainty\r\nstill prevails regarding the arrangement and the relationship of the\r\nindividual families of the Choripetalæ, and some of the following\r\nfamilies are hardly quite natural; but the best arrangement arrived at\r\nso far has been adopted here.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the book a review of the orders of the Dicotyledons\r\nwill be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Sub-Class 1. =Choripetalæ. Petals free.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 1. =Salicifloræ.=\r\n\r\nTrees and shrubs, which, in the structure of the vegetative shoot and\r\nthe catkin-like inflorescences, resemble the Quercifloræ, but the\r\nstructure of the flower differs so much from them, that the only order\r\nbrought under this heading--_Salicaceæ_--well deserves to be separated\r\nand to form a family of its own, the nearest relatives of which are\r\nstill doubtful. ~As Juglandaceæ and Myricaceæ also deserve to be placed\r\nin a special family, the name _Amentaceæ_ (_Catkin-bearers_), hitherto\r\napplied to all of these plants, cannot be retained as the name of a\r\nfamily.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 322.--Male and female catkins of _Salix\r\n  caprea_.]\r\n\r\nThere is only one order.\r\n\r\nOrder. =Salicaceæ= (=Willows=). Trees with simple, scattered,\r\n_stipulate leaves_. _Diœcious_. The flowers are arranged in _simple\r\ninflorescences_ (spikes or racemes) which are termed catkins, and which\r\nfall off as a whole after flowering (♂) or after the ripening of the\r\nfruit (♀) (Fig. 322). The perianth is very imperfect[33] or wanting,\r\nparticularly in _Salix_ (Fig. 323 _o_); the ♂-flower with 2–several\r\nstamens and without any trace of a carpel (_a_, _b_, _c_): the\r\n♀-flower has a free bicarpellate ovary, _unilocular_, and formed from 2\r\nlateral carpels with 2 _parietal_ (_median_) _placentæ_ and generally ∞\r\novules; the style divides into two stigmas (_d_, _e_, _f_). The fruit\r\nis a two-valved _capsule_ and the very small seeds bear a _tuft of\r\nhairs_ at the base. _Endosperm absent._--~The catkins are situated on\r\ndwarf-branches, which in some species often develop before the leaves\r\nand bear at their base only scale-leaves; in others foliage-leaves\r\nare borne beneath the catkins. The vegetative bud commences with 2\r\nbud-scales which are united on the anterior side into a scale. The\r\ncapsule opens by the dorsal suture. The seed-hairs spring from the\r\nfunicle.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 323.--_Salix_: male flowers of _S. pentandra_\r\n  (_a_), _S. aurita_ (_b_), _S. rubra_ (_c_), female flowers of _S.\r\n  aurita_ (_d_), _S. nigricans_ (_e_), _S. mollissima_ (_f_).]\r\n\r\n_Salix_ (Willow) has short-stalked, most frequently lanceolate leaves\r\nand erect catkins with undivided bracts (Fig. 322). The flowers are\r\nnaked; 1 (_o_ in _a-f_) or 2 yellowish glands situated in the median\r\nline. In the ♂-flower generally two stamens, situated laterally like\r\nthe carpels in the ♀-flower. ~Various forms are seen in Fig. 323.--The\r\nterminal bud of the branches often aborts regularly, the uppermost\r\nlateral bud taking its place.~\r\n\r\n_Populus_ (Aspen, Poplar) has long-stalked, more or less round or\r\ncordate leaves with drawn-out apex; catkin pendulous; lobed bracts;\r\nperianth cup-like with oblique edge; stamens usually numerous; stigmas\r\noften divided.--~_P. tremula_ (Aspen) has received its name from the\r\ntremor of the leaves: _cf._ “to shake like an aspen leaf.”~\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. The Poplars are wind-pollinated. The Willows have\r\n   sticky pollen and are pollinated by insects. The catkins of\r\n   the Willows, especially the ♂, are more conspicuous, from the\r\n   numerous, closely-packed, yellow flowers, rich in honey and\r\n   pollen. The catkins often appear before the foliage and so\r\n   are much more easily seen, whilst at this time of the year the\r\n   number of competing honey-flowers is smaller, and the insect\r\n   visits consequently more numerous. On many catkins of the Willow\r\n   the flowers open earliest on the side which is turned towards\r\n   the sun and in descending order, _i.e._ the upper flowers\r\n   develop before the lower ones. Hybrids frequently appear.\r\n\r\n   There are about 180 species existing in the northern, cold and\r\n   temperate latitudes. Some in the Polar regions are scarcely more\r\n   than an inch in height, and have a creeping rhizome (_Salix\r\n   herbacea_, _polaris_, _reticulata_). Fossil forms are found in\r\n   the Tertiary and perhaps also in the Upper Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n   USES. Principally for ornamental trees, as they grow very\r\n   quickly and are easily propagated by cuttings, _S. babylonica_,\r\n   Weeping Willow; _S. purpurea_; _Populus alba_, Silver Poplar;\r\n   _P. pyramidalis_, Pyramid Poplar--a form of _P. nigra_; _P.\r\n   monilifera_, Canadian Poplar. The wood is very poor and\r\n   little used; the branches of many Willows are cultivated for\r\n   basket-making, etc. The wood of the Aspen is used for matches.\r\n   The bark contains tannin and, in many Willows, a very bitter\r\n   extract, _Salicin_ (_S. pentandra_, _fragilis_). Salicylic\r\n   acid (officinal) is obtained from _Salix_. Balsam is extracted\r\n   from the buds of many Poplars, especially when the leaves are\r\n   shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 2. =Casuarinifloræ.=\r\n\r\nTrees with verticillate, scale-like leaves forming sheaths at the\r\nnodes. Monœcious. Flowers unisexual. ♂-flowers in catkins; ♀ in short\r\nspikes. _Pollen-tube entering the ovule at the chalaza_, and not\r\nthrough the micropyle. Ovary 1-seeded, unilocular. Carpels uniting into\r\na multiple fruit. Only one order.\r\n\r\nOrder. =Casuarinaceæ.= Trees (30 species), from Australia and certain\r\nparts of S.E. Asia, with peculiar, equisetum-like appearance. The\r\nleaves are verticillate, scale-like and united into sheaths. The\r\ninternodes are furrowed. Branching verticillate. The unisexual flowers\r\nare situated in catkins or short spikes. The ♂-flower has a central\r\nstamen, surrounded by 2 median, scale-like perianth-leaves and 2\r\nlateral bracteoles. The ♀-flower has a 1-chambered ovary (2 ascending,\r\northotropous ovules), no perianth, but 2 large, lateral bracteoles\r\nwhich finally become woody and form two valves, between which the\r\nnut-like fruit is situated. The multiple-fruits therefore resemble\r\nsmall cones.--_Casuarina equisetifolia_, cultivated, gives “iron-wood.”\r\n\r\n   [The Casuarinas differ from the ordinary Dicotyledons in many\r\n   important respects which may be briefly summarised thus:--The\r\n   bicarpellate ♀-flower has a well-pronounced stylar-cylinder\r\n   terminated by two stigmas, but the cavity of the ovary closes\r\n   very soon after its formation, and in it are developed two\r\n   parietal ovules; these are united by a bridge of cellulose to\r\n   the stylar-cylinder or summit of the ovary, and hence the ovules\r\n   are connected with the walls of the ovary by the bridge (above),\r\n   as well as by the funicle (below). The archespore is developed\r\n   from the hypodermal cells at the summit of the nucellus,\r\n   two primordial mother-cells are first formed and from these\r\n   by tangential divisions a central cylindrical mass of cells\r\n   (sporogenous-tissue) is produced which is surrounded by tapetal\r\n   cells. The cells of the sporogenous tissue correspond to the\r\n   mother-cells of the embryo-sac of other Angiosperms; they divide\r\n   transversely and from 16–20 macrospores are formed together with\r\n   inactive cells which are not crushed together as in the case\r\n   of other Phanerogams. The sexual apparatus is developed from a\r\n   single cell, but the number of cells composing this apparatus\r\n   is subject to variation, the oosphere being accompanied by one\r\n   or two neighbouring cells which resemble canal-cells rather\r\n   than synergidæ. The sexual apparatus is found in the majority\r\n   of the macrospores, but in most of these it remains as a number\r\n   of naked cells; while in the fertile macrospores the cells\r\n   are invested by walls of cellulose (usually only one fertile\r\n   macrospore is found in each ovule). Antipodal cells are never\r\n   developed. The macrospores elongate considerably towards the\r\n   chalaza, into which some penetrate. The pollen-tube traverses\r\n   the stylar-cylinder and enters the ovules at the chalaza, its\r\n   passage through the tissue of the nucellus being assisted by\r\n   the prolongation of the macrospores. About the centre of the\r\n   nucellus the pollen-tube is ruptured; the apical portion which\r\n   alone takes part in the fertilisation being firmly attached to\r\n   the macrospore. Although the actual impregnation has not been\r\n   observed, Treub considers that the endosperm begins to be formed\r\n   before fertilisation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 3. =Quercifloræ.=\r\n\r\n_Trees_ and _shrubs_ with small, unisexual, _monœcious_ flowers, having\r\nno perianth or a simple inconspicuous one. The ♂ and ♀ flowers are\r\nvery different and generally placed in separate inflorescences. The\r\n♂-flowers are most often adnate to the bracts. The stamens are placed\r\n_opposite the perianth-leaves_, when they are present in equal numbers.\r\nThe ♀-flower is _naked_, or has a _superior_ perianth. The ovary at\r\nthe base is 2- or 3-(-6) locular with 1 or 2 pendulous ovules in each\r\nloculus, only one of which is developed; the fruit is a one-seeded\r\n_nut_; _endosperm absent_; embryo straight. The inflorescences, which\r\nare either compound and mixed (small dichasia in spikes) or simple,\r\nare here also termed _catkins_; but, strictly speaking, this term is\r\napplied to the ♂-inflorescences only. In all Quercifloræ the leaves are\r\n_scattered_ (usually in 2 rows) _simple_, and _penninerved_, and with\r\n_deciduous stipules_.\r\n\r\n   It is worthy of remark that in _Betulaceæ_, _Corylaceæ_ and\r\n   _Quercus_ the ovules, and to some extent the loculi of the\r\n   ovary are not developed till after pollination, so that the\r\n   development of the pollen-tube proceeds very slowly. The\r\n   smallness of the flowers, the absence of honey, the dryness\r\n   and lightness of the pollen, the size of the stigma and the\r\n   abundance of hairs found on many stigmas are all adaptations for\r\n   wind-pollination. It is also an advantage that the flowers are\r\n   generally pollinated before the foliage-leaves are developed,\r\n   thus preventing the pollen being entangled by the leaves.\r\n\r\n   The two orders _Betulaceæ_ and _Corylaceæ_ mentioned here are\r\n   by other authors united into one order. [It is doubtful whether\r\n   these two should be retained in the family Quercifloræ, as\r\n   recent researches (p. 273) have shown that they differ from\r\n   the Cupuliferæ in many important points, and agree with the\r\n   Casuarinas in the fact that the pollen-tube enters the ovule\r\n   through the chalaza.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Betulaceæ= (=Birches=). Monœcious, with thick, cylindrical,\r\n_compound_ ♂ and ♀ inflorescences (2- or 3-flowered dichasia in a spike\r\nwith spirally-placed floral-leaves) (Figs. 324, 326, 328). When the\r\nperianth in the ♂-flower is completely developed, it is composed of 4\r\nsomewhat united leaves, which are placed opposite the 4 stamens (Figs.\r\n325, 326 _A_). The female flowers are _naked_; the ovary is bilocular,\r\nwith two styles and one _pendulous_ ovule in each loculus. The\r\nsubtending floral-leaves unite with the bracteoles and form a 3–5-lobed\r\ncover-scale, which is not attached to the fruit (Figs. 325 _D_, 326\r\n_B_). Fruit a _nut without cupule_ (see _Corylaceæ_ and _Cupuliferæ_).\r\n~In the bud the leaves are flat. The stipules are deciduous. On\r\ngermination the cotyledons are raised above the ground. Terminal buds\r\nare only found on old Alder trees; the Birch has sympodial branches.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 324.--_Alnus glutinosus._ Branch of Alder\r\n  with ♂-(_n_) and ♀-(_m_) catkins: _k_ bud; _b_ fruit-bearing\r\n  catkin (“cone.”)]\r\n\r\n_Alnus_ (Alder) (Figs. 324–326). In the majority of species the ♂-and\r\n♀-catkins are both developed in the year previous to their flowering,\r\nand pass the winter naked and bloom before the leaves expand. ♂-flower:\r\n4 stamens. ♀-flower: the 5-lobed cover-scales of the ♀-catkin are woody\r\nand remain attached to the axis, so that the entire catkin when ripe\r\nresembles a small cone (Fig. 324 _b_). Each cover-scale supports two\r\nwinged or wingless nuts. ~In the native species of Alder the buds are\r\nstalked (Fig. 324 _k_). The bud-scales are formed by the stipules of\r\nthe lowest leaves.~\r\n\r\n_Betula_ (Birch). The ♂-catkins, in the native species, appear\r\nin autumn, the ♀-catkins in the flowering year on leaf-bearing,\r\nshort-lived shoots. ♂-flowers: 2 stamens, divided (Fig. 328 _A_). The\r\n3-lobed cover-scales (Fig. 327 _a_) of the ♀-catkin are detached from\r\nthe axis; each cover-scale supports 3 broadly winged nuts (_b_).\r\n~The stem has cork with annual rings. The young twigs and leaves have\r\naromatic resin glands.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 325.--_Alnus glutinosa_: _A_ dichasium\r\n  of ♂-flowers seen from the front; _B_ the same from inside;\r\n  _C_ the same from the back; _D_ dichasium of ♀-flowers with\r\n  subtending-leaf and four bracteoles.

All the\r\n  bracteoles in _A_ and _C_ are slightly pressed from their normal\r\n  position.]\r\n\r\n   THE INFLORESCENCES OF THE ALDER.--In the axil of each\r\n   cover-scale [_b_ in the Figs] is situated, in the ♂-catkins\r\n   (Figs. 326 _A_, 325 _A-C_) a 3-flowered dichasium, the\r\n   flowers of which have a 4-partite perianth, the posterior\r\n   perianth-segments being sometimes almost suppressed, and 4\r\n   stamens with undivided filaments. In the ♀-catkin (Figs. 325\r\n   _D_, 326 _C_) a 2-flowered dichasium is found, the middle\r\n   flower being suppressed (indicated by a star in _C_). In both\r\n   instances the inflorescences have two bracteoles (α-β) and the\r\n   flowers borne in their axils have each one bracteole (β′), the\r\n   other one (α′) being suppressed and therefore in 326 _A_ and _C_\r\n   only represented by a dotted line; these four bracteoles unite\r\n   with the cover-scale (_b_) which supports the entire dichasium,\r\n   to form the 5-lobed “cone-scale” (Fig. 326 _B_) which in the\r\n   ♀-catkin eventually becomes woody.\r\n\r\n   THE INFLORESCENCES OF THE BIRCH.--A 3-flowered dichasium is\r\n   situated in the axil of the cover-scale in both ♂-and ♀-catkins\r\n   (Fig. 328 _A_, _B_); only the central flower has bracteoles\r\n   (α-β) (the lateral flowers having no bracteoles), and these\r\n   bracteoles unite, as in the Alder, with the supporting\r\n   cover-scale (_b_), and form a three-lobed cone-scale (Fig. 327\r\n   _a_).\r\n\r\n   While the ♀-flower exactly resembles that of the Alder, the\r\n   reduction of the ♂-flower, already described in the Alder, is\r\n   carried further, so that often only the 2 median perianth-leaves\r\n   are developed (Fig. 328 _A_); there are also _only_ 2 stamens,\r\n   these being deeply cleft, while the other 2 are suppressed.\r\n\r\n   About 50 species; N. Temp.--Fossil-forms certainly occur in\r\n   the Oligocene.

America and Asia.\r\n   Wind-pollinated.\r\n\r\n   USES.--Important forest trees. The bark contains tannic acid.\r\n   The tar of the Birch is used in the preparation of Russia\r\n   leather; whilst its spring sap is very saccharine, and is used\r\n   in some places for making a fermented drink.

Monœcious. The ♂-catkins are long\r\nand cylindrical; the ♂-flowers are placed singly in the axil of the\r\nsubtending-leaf (cover-scale); they are _naked_ and formed of a number\r\nof _divided_ stamens, which are partly united with the cover-scale,\r\n4 in the Hazel, apparently 8 (Figs. 330 _A_, 329 _B_, _C_), more on\r\nthe Hornbeam. The ♀-flowers have a very small, _superior_ perianth;\r\nin the axil of each cover-scale a 2-flowered dichasium (Fig. 329\r\n_D_) is present, of which the central flower (* in Fig. 330 _B_)\r\nis suppressed. The gynœceum is bicarpellary as in the Birches; the\r\novary is bilocular, with two long styles (Fig. 329 _D-F_); the loculi\r\nhave 1 (-2) ovules (Fig. 330 _B_). Each single ♀-flower and fruit is\r\nsurrounded by a _leaf-like covering_, the _cupule_ (husk), which is\r\n_formed of three floral-leaves_ (namely, the bract of a lateral flower,\r\nand its own bracteoles; thus in Fig. 330 _B_, α, α′, β’ form the cupule\r\nfor the left-hand flower, and β, α_[1}, β_[1}, the cupule for the\r\nright-hand).\r\n\r\n_Corylus_ (Hazel-nut, Fig. 329). The long, cylindrical ♂-catkins pass\r\nthe winter naked, 2–3 together, on short branches. The very small\r\n♀-catkins are enclosed in buds, in which they pass the winter; these\r\nbuds are situated in the axils of the fallen foliage-leaves, and it\r\nis only by their larger size that they may be distinguished from the\r\nordinary foliage-buds. In spring the ♀-catkins are easily recognised\r\nby their red, projecting stigmas (Fig. 329 _A_). The cupule--the\r\n“husk”--is tubular, fringed, and envelopes the nut. ~The leaves are\r\nalternate and unsymmetrical, the external side being larger than\r\nthe internal; this is connected with the vernation, the blade being\r\nconduplicate in the bud; the stipules are deciduous. The bud-scales\r\nare formed of stipules, the most internal having a leaf-blade attached\r\nto them which is suppressed in the external ones. The cotyledons remain\r\nunderground on germination.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 329.--_Corylus avellana_: _A_ branch at\r\n  the time of flowering with ♂-and ♀-catkins; _B_ ♂-flower with\r\n  subtending-leaf (bract) and two bracteoles; _C_ the same without\r\n  the anthers; _D_ view of interior of ♀-dichasium shortly after\r\n  fertilisation; _E_ young fruit with cupule; _F_ similar one with\r\n  the cupule opened; _G_ mature ♀-fruits; _H_ nut.]\r\n\r\n_Carpinus_ (_C. betulus_, Hornbeam). The ♂-and ♀-catkins do not appear\r\ntill the leaves are shooting. The ♀-catkin in this instance is also\r\nlong and cylindrical. The cupule in _C. betulus_ is 3-lobed, and\r\nto a slight extent only embraces the base of the ribbed nut (Fig.\r\n331); each lobe corresponds to a floral-leaf. ~Whilst the carpels\r\nare placed medianly in _Corylus_, in _Carpinus_, on the other hand,\r\nthey are situated transversely, as in the case of the _Betulaceæ_.\r\nThe lamina of the leaf is not conduplicate in the bud, but flat,\r\nand folded only along the lateral veins, which are also indicated\r\nin the form of the fully-developed leaf; otherwise the vegetative\r\ncharacters are essentially the same as in the Hazel. The cotyledons\r\nare aerial.--_Ostrya_ resembles the Hornbeam, but the cupule completely\r\nenvelopes the nut, as a sac open at the apex (Eur., N. Am., Japan).~\r\n\r\n   N.

The fruits of _C. avellana_ (ordinary Hazel-nut),\r\n   _C. tubulosa_ (Lambert’s nut) and _C. colurna_ (Turkish Filbert)\r\n   are edible.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 330.--Diagrams of the ♂-flower (_A_) of\r\n  _Corylus_ and the dichasium of the ♀-flowers (_B_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 331.--Nut of the Hornbeam with cupule.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Cupuliferæ.= Monœcious. The inflorescences make their\r\nappearance with the leaves, arising in the axils of the leaves of\r\nthe same year. _A woody cupule_ furnished externally with scales or\r\nspines is _common_, and surrounds 1-several flowers (the cupule in\r\nthe Corylaceæ never encloses more than a _single_ flower or fruit).\r\nThe ♂-flower has a united perianth, which is, however, 4–6 partite,\r\nand encloses an indefinite number of undivided stamens. The ♀-flower\r\nhas a _superior, 6-merous_ perianth (3 + 3, compare Figs. 332 _D_,\r\n334); the gynœceum is formed of 3 (or in _Castanea_ 4–6) carpels with\r\na corresponding number of stigmas (Figs. 332 _D_, _H_; 334, 335); and\r\nthe ovary has at the base 3 (-6) loculi (Fig. 333), each of which has 2\r\npendulous anatropous ovules; the fruit is a one-seeded nut (Figs. 332\r\n_H_, 336).\r\n\r\nThe cupule of the Cupuliferæ, according to the opinion of Eichler, is\r\nformed by united bracteoles, (compare Fig. 333, where the four valves\r\nin the cupule of Castanea are considered as bracteoles of the lateral\r\nflowers of the dichasium); according to another view (see Prantl, in\r\nEngler’s _Bot. Jahrb._, viii., 1889), it is a ring-like axial outgrowth\r\nindependent of the bracteoles of the flower, whose scales and spines\r\nare floral-leaves. The cupule in the Oak only encloses the base of the\r\nfruit, but in the Eating-chestnut and Beech the fruit is completely\r\nenclosed, and consequently the cupule must divide into a number of\r\nvalves (generally 4) to allow the fruit to escape. In the 3-flowered\r\ndichasia of _Pasania_, Sect. Eupasania (Trop. Ind.), each individual\r\nflower has its own cupule of the same structure and development as in\r\n_Quercus_; and, moreover, each group of flowers has externally the\r\ntypical six bracteoles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 332.--_Castanea vesca_: _A_ branch with\r\n  inflorescences; _B_ ♂-flower; _C_ young cupule with three\r\n  ♀-flowers; _D_ ♀-flower; _E_ the same in longitudinal section;\r\n  _F_ cupule with 3 nuts (diminished); _G_, _H_ nuts (_G_ in\r\n  longitudinal section to show embryo).]\r\n\r\n_Castanea_ (Eating-chestnut, Fig. 332). The catkins are erect (_A_),\r\ncylindrical, with the ♀ at the base and the ♂ at the top, or some\r\nare entirely ♂ and _composed of small dichasia_. The _cupule_ (_C_,\r\n_F_) is 4-_valved_, provided with spines, and entirely envelops the 3\r\n_nuts_; it is already developed at the time of flowering.--~♂-flowers\r\nare most frequently borne in 7-flowered dichasia, and have a well\r\ndeveloped perianth, most frequently consisting of 6 leaves in two\r\nwhorls (Fig. 332 _B_), and a large number of stamens. ♀-flowers are\r\nmost frequently borne in 3-flowered dichasia (Figs. 332 _C_, 333); the\r\nletters in Fig. 333 indicate the older theory, according to which the\r\n4 bracteoles (α′-β′) of the two lateral flowers are thick and united\r\ninto a single 4-valved, _woody cupule_, which surrounds the 3 nuts,\r\nand is furnished externally with spines; the spines are well developed\r\nhair-structures.--6 carpels in two whorls.--The leaves in the vertical\r\nshoots have a divergence of 2/5, 3/8, 5/13; on the horizontal shoots\r\nthey are alternate. The cotyledons remain underground on germination.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 333.--Diagram of the cupule of _Castanea_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 334.--Female flower of _Fagus_ (mag.)]\r\n\r\n_Fagus_ (Beech). The ♂-catkins are pendulous, capitate; the ♂-flowers\r\nhave an obliquely bell-shaped, fringed perianth, with 6–20 stamens.\r\n♀-catkins erect, 2-flowered, borne singly in the axil of foliage-leaves\r\nof the same year; the ♀-flower has a gynœceum formed of 3 carpels,\r\nbearing an epigynous, 6-leaved perianth (Fig. 334). In this genus\r\n_the dichasium has only 2 flowers_, the central one being suppressed.\r\n_The cupule contains_, therefore, only 2 triangular nuts (“mast”).\r\n~All the shoots have the leaves arranged in two rows; the rows are\r\non the underside, being only about 90° distant from each other; the\r\nbuds on the other hand approach each other towards the upper side. The\r\nbud-scales are stipules without laminæ; in vernation the laminæ are\r\nfolded along the lateral ribs, the upper lateral portion being the\r\nlargest (as in Hornbeam and Chestnut). The cotyledons are folded, and\r\nat germination are aerial, large, and reniform. 4 species (Europe,\r\nJapan, N. Am.)--_Nothofagus_ (S. Am., New Zealand, S. Austr.)~\r\n\r\n_Quercus_ (Oak, Fig. 335). Catkins simple. ♂-catkins long,\r\nthin, _pendulous_, few-flowered. ♀-catkins erect; the cupule is\r\n_cup-like_, _entire_, and encloses only the base of the solitary nut\r\n(“acorn”).--~The ♂-flower has a similar construction to that of the\r\nChestnut. The ♀-catkin has not more than 5 flowers (single-flowered\r\ndichasia, in which _only the central flower is developed_). The\r\nscales on the cupules are no doubt leaf-structures in this case also.\r\nAccording to another theory, the scales are hair-structures; they arise\r\non the internal face of the young cupule apparently in descending, but\r\nreally in ascending order. The rim of the cupule gradually expands.\r\nIn the ♀-flower (Fig. 335) the loculi of the gynœceum, together with\r\nthe ovules, are not developed until _after_ pollination.--The leaves\r\nin all cases have a divergence of 2/5; the lowermost leaves on the\r\nshoots are reduced to stipules which serve as the bud-scales (5 rows).\r\nThe laminæ are conduplicate, as in _Corylus_, and the external side is\r\nthe broadest. The cotyledons are fleshy and remain underground. 200\r\nspecies.--_Pasania_ (100 species).~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 335.--_Quercus_: _A_ ♀-flower in its cupule\r\n  (mag.); _B_ longitudinal section through _A_, showing cupule,\r\n  perianth, and inferior ovary.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 336.--Fruit of _Quercus_.]\r\n\r\n   368 species, in temperate climates, especially in Europe and\r\n   N. America. Authenticated forests have been found in the\r\n   Oligocene. The Beech has one species, _Fagus sylvatica_, in\r\n   Europe; it is a most important forest tree (in Denmark the most\r\n   important) and reaches its most northern limit near Alvesund\r\n   in Norway (60° N.L.), its northern boundary line passing\r\n   from Alvesund in a zig-zag line through Ludwigsort, south\r\n   of Königsberg, in Prussia, towards the Crimea. According to\r\n   Steenstrup and Vaupell, the Beech did not make its appearance\r\n   in Denmark until a comparatively recent time, the Oak then\r\n   being partially supplanted. Other species of Beech are found\r\n   in N. America and Japan. Several species of _Nothofagus_\r\n   occur in the South West of S. America, and in the colder\r\n   regions of the southern hemisphere. The Oaks grow especially\r\n   in temperate regions, _e.g._ in Western Asia, N. America,\r\n   and the mountains of Mexico. Evergreen species are found in\r\n   Tropical Asia, Himalaya, Japan and the Mediterranean region.\r\n   In this country there is one species of Oak (_Q. robur_), of\r\n   which there are three varieties (_Q. pedunculata, intermedia,\r\n   sessiliflora_). The Eating-chestnut is found in the South of\r\n   Europe, but is cultivated in the midland and southern counties\r\n   of England.--USES. The wood of these trees is very useful as\r\n   timber. The wood of _Q. tinctoria_ has a yellow colouring\r\n   matter (Quercitron-wood). The bark of the Oak contains a large\r\n   quantity of tannic acid, and is used for tanning; for this\r\n   purpose also the cupules of _Q. vallonea_, _ægilops_, _græca_,\r\n   and others from the Eastern Mediterranean, are used under the\r\n   name of “Valloons.” The Cork-oak (_Q. suber_; S.W. Europe) is\r\n   the most important tree from which cork is obtained, its bark\r\n   being very largely developed and stripped for cork. Gall-nuts\r\n   are found on many species; those of _Q. lusitanica_, var.\r\n   _infectoria_ (Eastern Mediterranean) are officinal, and likewise\r\n   the fruits (acorns) and the bark of _Quercus pedunculata_ and\r\n   _sessiliflora_. Oil is obtained from the Beech “mast.” The nuts\r\n   of the Chestnut tree are edible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 4. =Juglandifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThis family resembles the Quercifloræ in the catkin-like\r\ninflorescences, the imperfect, _unisexual_ flowers, the epigynous\r\nperianth and the woody shoots with scattered leaves, etc., though it\r\nis in other respects very dissimilar; one point of difference is the\r\npresence of _aromatic_ compounds, but a more important divergence is\r\nfound in the structure of the gynœceum, which is formed of two carpels\r\nwith _one loculus_ and has one _basal_, _orthotropous and erect_\r\novule, which, as in the Quercifloræ, does not become developed until\r\nafter pollination; the fruit too is very different, being generally a\r\n_drupe_. _Endosperm absent._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 337.--_Juglans regia_: _A_ ♂-flower seen\r\n  from below with bract (cover-scale) (_b_), bracteoles (α and β),\r\n  perianth-leaves (_p_); _B_ the same from the front; _C_ lateral\r\n  view of the same; _D_ diagram of _A_; _E_ ♀-flower with bract,\r\n  the bracteoles are united with the ovary, their edge being\r\n  visible as an indented line below the perianth; _F_ 2 ♀-flowers\r\n  at the end of a foliage-shoot; _G_ fruit (without the fleshy\r\n  covering) in longitudinal section; _H_ transverse section of the\r\n  same.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Juglandaceæ (Walnuts).= Leaves _scattered_, _imparipinnate_,\r\nrich in _aromatic_ compounds. _Stipules absent._ Flowers unisexual.\r\n_Monœcious._ The ♂-catkins are lateral, generally on naked branches\r\nof the previous year, cylindrical, pendulous, many-flowered; the two\r\nbracteoles and the 2–4-leaved perianth of the ♂-flower unite with\r\nthe subtending bract; the ♂-flower has indefinite stamens (6–20 in\r\n_Juglans_, Fig. 337 _A-D_). The ♀-catkins are terminal, generally on\r\nbranches of the same year, few-flowered (Fig. 337 _F_); the ♀-flowers\r\nhave a _superior_, 4-leaved perianth, a bicarpellate gynœceum, two\r\nstyles with stigmas on the internal surface. The ovary, bracteoles\r\nand bract all unite together (Fig. 337 _E_). The fruit is generally a\r\ngreen or black _drupe_,[34] whose flesh (outer soft portion) in _Carya_\r\nand _Juglans_ ruptures more or less irregularly, and frees the stone\r\n(“Walnut”).--~The stone in _Juglans_ is divided internally by one true\r\n(Fig. 337 _H_) and by several false, low partition walls into several\r\n_incomplete_ compartments, so that the two large _cotyledons_ become\r\nlobed and incised to fit like a cast into the irregularities of the\r\ninner surface of the stone; the embryo is exendospermous and covered\r\nwith a thin testa.--THE LEAF SCARS are large and cordate with 3 groups\r\nof vascular bundles. The PITH in _Juglans_ and _Pterocarya_ is divided\r\ninto chambers. The stone ruptures, on germination, along the dorsal\r\nsuture into 2 valves; the cotyledons remain underground. In _Juglans\r\nregia_ a long row of accessory buds is found on the lowest internode\r\n(epicotyl) above the axils of the cotyledons. _Pollination by the\r\nwind._ Both protogynous and protandrous examples of _Juglans regia_\r\noccur.--33 species, mostly in temperate North America.--USES. Walnuts\r\nare obtained from _J. nigra_ and _regia_; Hickory from North American\r\nspecies of _Carya_.

To this order belong shrubs or trees which\r\nhave penninerved, simple, at most lobed or pinnatifid leaves, with\r\nor without stipules, and with yellow, aromatic, resin glands (Fig.\r\n338 _a_). The flowers, situated in catkin-like spikes, are unisexual\r\nand _naked_, and supported by scale-like floral-leaves. ♂-flower: 4–6\r\n(–16) stamens with short filaments; ♀: generally situated singly. The\r\ngynœceum has a short style with 2 long stigmas, and unites with the\r\nbracteoles, which form wing-like outgrowths on the ripe drupe as in\r\n_Pterocarya_ in the Juglandaceæ (Fig. 338). Cotyledons fleshy (Fig. 338\r\n_b_).--_Myrica_; _Comptonia_.\r\n\r\n   40 species; Temperate.--_Myrica gale_ (Sweet-gale, Bog-myrtle)\r\n   has been used in the preparation of beer (Sweet-willow beer)\r\n   on account of its resinous essential oil. _M. cerifera_ (N.\r\n   America) and species from the Cape, _M. quercifolia_ and others,\r\n   form wax on the fruit which is used in the preparation of\r\n   candles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 5. =Urticifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers are regular, _hypogynous_, nearly always unisexual, _small_\r\nand insignificant, with _single_, green perianth of 4–5 leaves. Stamens\r\n4–5, _placed opposite_ the leaves of the perianth. Ovary formed of 1\r\nor 2 carpels, most frequently _unilocular_, with one ovule (Fig. 340).\r\nThe fruit is a _nut_, more rarely a drupe, with one seed, _generally\r\nendospermous_. ~The Nettles are the sole order in the family which has\r\nonly one carpel (1 stigma); this turns the posterior side to the front\r\n(Fig. 340). The others have two carpels (2 stigmas) but the anterior\r\nonly is fertile (Fig. 346) except in a few Ulmaceæ and Moraceæ.~\r\n\r\nThe majority are trees or shrubs with petiolated leaves, _stipulate_;\r\n_rough hairs_ are very frequently developed upon the leaves. The\r\nflowers are very often crowded together in the inflorescence, which is\r\nrarely catkin-like. Peculiar aggregations of fruits are found in some\r\norders. _Latex_ and tough _bast_, which is used technically, are also\r\nfrequently found. Cystoliths are found in the epidermis of many species\r\nof _Ficus_, _Urtica_, and others. ~_Wind-_ or _self-pollination_\r\nis most common, as in the Quercifloræ and Juglandifloræ.~ In ~the\r\nUrticaceæ, _Morus_ and some others, the stamens lie incurved in the\r\nbud, and when ripe straighten themselves suddenly and elastically,\r\nand thus small clouds of pollen-grains are ejected with considerable\r\nviolence on to the stigmas, which are often provided with brush-like\r\nhairs (Fig. 341). The formation of honey does not take place.~\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Ulmaceæ= (=Elms=).--Trees or shrubs without latex. Leaves\r\nsimple, arranged in two rows (divergence 1/2), oblique (the inner side,\r\nnearer the axis, being the larger), strongly penninerved, dentate,\r\nhispid; stipules deciduous. In opposition to the other Nettle-like\r\nplants the flowers are often ☿ with a united cup- or saucer-like,\r\ngenerally 4–(5)–6-divided perianth, and a corresponding or larger\r\nnumber of opposite _erect_ stamens. The gynœceum has two carpels\r\n(2 stigmas), generally one loculus with one pendulous, anatropous\r\nor amphitropous ovule,[35] seldom two loculi and 2 ovules. Fruit\r\none-seeded (nut or drupe). Embryo without endosperm.\r\n\r\n=A.= ULMEÆ. The fruit is a _winged nut_ (Fig. 339), the embryo\r\nstraight, without endosperm. Anthers extrorse.--_Ulmus_ (Elm). The\r\nflowers are situated in inflorescences which develop from the lower\r\nbuds of the shoot of the preceding year. ~The lowermost bud-scales\r\nare empty, the uppermost support either solitary flowers, or small,\r\ndichasial or unipared scorpioid inflorescences. The terminal bud on the\r\nvegetative shoot quickly falls off, and the upper lateral bud continues\r\nthe growth sympodially. Flowering takes place before the leaf-buds\r\nopen. The flowers are wind-pollinated and have no honey. Fossil species\r\nhave been found in the Oligocene.~\r\n\r\n   20 species; North Temp. (2 species in this country). Important\r\n   as timber. The Cork-elm (_U. suberosa_) has a rather thick cork,\r\n   which, however, is of no technical use. The bast is used as\r\n   Lime-bast.\r\n\r\n   =B.= CELTIDEÆ. The fruit is a drupe, the embryo curved, with\r\n   folded or rolled up cotyledons, with or without endosperm.\r\n   The anthers are introrse. The flowers are borne on a shoot of\r\n   the same year. _Planera_ (N. America); _Zelkova_.--About 114\r\n   species; especially N.

The flowers (Fig. 340) are _unisexual_, generally\r\n2-merous and arranged _in clusters_, which are united into catkin-like\r\ninflorescences. The perianth is composed very often of 4 (2 + 2)\r\nfree, or in the ♀-flowers generally united, green leaves; the 4 (2\r\n+ 2) stamens are opposite the perianth-leaves, the filaments are\r\n_bent inwards_ in the bud and throw themselves elastically towards\r\nthe outside. The gynœceum has _one style_ and _one stigma_ (capitate\r\nor brush-like, Fig. 341); the ovary is unilocular, with _one\r\northotropous_, _erect_ ovule (all other orders of this family have\r\ninverted or curved ovules). Fruit, a nut or drupe. _Endosperm present_\r\n(in _Urtica_ very little), oily. Embryo straight. ~The STINGING HAIRS\r\nare club-shaped, very turgid, and provided with a siliceous, brittle\r\napex, which breaks off in an oblique direction and allows the poisonous\r\ncell-sap to be forced out. In many tropical Nettles this is so strong\r\nthat it may produce partial paralysis. There is no rudiment of an ovary\r\nin the ♂-flowers (Fig. 340 A). The PERIANTH in the ♀-flower differs\r\nfrom that of the ♂ in having the two internal leaves generally much\r\nlarger and enveloping the fruit (Fig. 340 _B_); it often happens that\r\nall the perianth-leaves are united to form a gamophyllous envelope.\r\n☿-flowers may occur among the others.--THE INFLORESCENCES among our\r\nnative species are dichasia, which become transformed into unilateral\r\nscorpioid cymes by the development of the bud of the 2nd bracteole. In\r\n_Parietaria_ they are more pressed together, and the floral-leaves at\r\nthe same time are also raised on their axillary shoots to just beneath\r\nthe flower. As a rule, not only in this order but also in those related\r\nto it, a small vegetative branch is situated in the axil of the\r\nfoliage-leaf, and this bears an inflorescence on each side at its base.~\r\n\r\n_Urtica_ (Nettle) has opposite leaves with distinct stipules and\r\nstinging hairs. The perianth-leaves of the ♀-flower are free (Fig.\r\n340).--_Parietaria_ (Pellitory) has scattered leaves without large\r\nstipules, and stinging hairs are absent. The ♀-perianth is 4-toothed,\r\nflask- or bell-shaped.--~_Pilea_ is a tropical genus with trimerous,\r\nzygomorphic ♀-flowers, the posterior perianth-leaf being much larger\r\nthan the two others, and more or less hood shaped.--The flower of\r\n_Forskohlea_ is the most reduced; the ♂-flower has only one stamen, and\r\nthe ♀-as well as the ♂-flowers have a one-sided, tongue like perianth\r\n(?). _Pouzolzia._~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 340.--Diagram of ♂-and ♀-flowers of _Urtica\r\n  dioica_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 341.--_Parietaria diffusa_; hermaphrodite\r\n  flower: _a_ in the female, _b_ at the commencement of the male\r\n  stage; the stigma has fallen off, but the anthers have not yet\r\n  dehisced.]\r\n\r\n   WIND-POLLINATED. The pollen is shot out of the anthers, when\r\n   they spring forward, and is caught by long stigmatic hairs.\r\n   _Parietaria diffusa_ is protogynous (Fig. 341).\r\n\r\n   500 species; chiefly in the Tropics, although the few species\r\n   which occur in Europe are represented by a much larger number\r\n   of individuals.--USES.

Nearly all trees or shrubs, seldom\r\nherbs, generally with latex. The leaves are scattered, and not\r\ninfrequently lobed. The flowers are _unisexual_ (monœcious or diœcious)\r\nand arranged in catkin- or capitulum-like, compound inflorescences.\r\nPerianth-leaves 2–6, generally 4, with an equal number of stamens\r\nopposite to them, as in the Nettles. The ovary is 1–seldom 2-locular,\r\nand has 2 stigmas (it is thus formed from 2 carpels) seldom only one\r\nstyle with one stigma. One ovule in each loculus, more or less curved,\r\nand _pendulous_; micropyle directed upwards. Fruit usually a drupe.\r\nThe embryo is generally curved inside the _fleshy endosperm_, or it is\r\nexendospermous.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 342.--_Morus alba_ ♂ flower (6/1).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 343.-_Morus alba_ ♀ inflorescence.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 344.--_Morus nigra_ fruits.]\r\n\r\n=A.= MOREÆ.

The flowers are similar to those of the Nettle, but with 2\r\ncarpels: in the ♂ with perianth 2 + 2, and stamens 2 + 2 (Fig. 342),\r\nin the ♀, perianth 2 + 2, and 2 carpels in regular alternation. The\r\nsmall drupes are enveloped by _the perianth, which eventually becomes\r\nfleshy_, and as all the flowers on the axis very accurately fit\r\ntogether, the collection of fruits is formed, which we call a Mulberry\r\n(Fig. 344). The leaves are folded in the buds, and have small stipules.\r\n~The following are allied to _Morus_:--_Maclura_, _Broussonetia_ (the\r\nPaper-mulberry tree) which has spheroid ♀ inflorescences (made up of\r\ndichasia), etc.~\r\n\r\n   _Dorstenia_ presents an interesting transitional form to the Fig\r\n   in its flat, open, and, in some instances, lobed inflorescence\r\n   on which the ♂ and ♀ flowers are sunk in grooves. Indications\r\n   of a somewhat similar structure are found in certain Nettles,\r\n   the sympodial axes of the dichasia becoming flatly expanded. The\r\n   fruits are 1-seeded, but, nevertheless, spring open and eject\r\n   their seeds.\r\n\r\n=B.= ARTOCARPEÆ. Filaments straight in the bud; foliage-leaves with\r\nconvolute vernation. An interpetiolar leaf-sheath (ocrea) formed in the\r\naxil of each leaf by the connate stipules, covers the younger leaves\r\nas a hood. It falls off as the leaf expands, and leaves a ring-like\r\nscar on the stem.--_Ficus_ (the Fig). The inflorescence (the so-called\r\nsyconus) has a pear-shaped, fleshy, but hollow axis, on the interior\r\nsurface of which the flowers are situated (Fig. 345). It is a kind\r\nof capitulum, with a hollow receptacle, whose “involucral” leaves\r\nclose over the entrance to the interior; it is not, however, a simple\r\ncapitulum, but a coalescence of cymose inflorescences. The edible parts\r\nare the fleshy stem-portion and perianth-leaves. The ♂-flower has a\r\n2–6 divided perianth, 1–2 (–6) stamens; the ♀-flower has an oblique\r\novary. The fruits are drupes, with thin flesh.--~Many species have\r\naerial roots, and some live as epiphytes on trees. POLLINATION, in the\r\nedible Fig, is effected by a small Gall-wasp (_Cynips psenes_ L.),\r\nwhich lays its eggs in the Fig, and hence carries the pollen away. Even\r\nin very ancient times it was customary to hang infected wild Figs on\r\nthe branches of cultivated ones, so that the young Gall-wasps, as they\r\nemerged, could immediately effect the pollination (caprification).\r\n_Ficus carica_, and other species, have two kinds of ♀-flowers, besides\r\nthe ♂-flowers. One kind has a short style and no stigmatic hairs,\r\nand it is only in the ovaries of these that the wasps lay their eggs\r\n(gall-flowers); the other kind has a long style and well-developed\r\nstigmatic-hairs, but the wasps cannot reach their ovaries--these are\r\n“seed-flowers.” There are, moreover, two kinds of plants of _Ficus\r\ncarica_; ♀-plants, which have only seed-flowers, and bear the edible\r\nFigs, and ♂-plants (called “Caprificus”), which bear inedible fruits,\r\nand have ♂-flowers at the upper part of the Fig, but gall-flowers at\r\nthe base. [The Caprificus, at Naples, bears three crops of inedible\r\nFigs each year, viz. _Mamme_ (April), _Profichi_ (June), _Mamnoni_\r\n(August). The ♂-flowers are produced especially in June, the first\r\nFigs being almost entirely ♀, and the last having but few ♂-flowers.\r\nEach crop produces a new generation of Fig-wasps. The female wasp\r\nenters the Figs on the Caprificus, and lays one egg in each flower,\r\nwith the result that the flower developes into a kind of gall. The\r\nmother-wasp dies within the Fig. The male wasp is wingless; it bites\r\na small passage into the ovaries containing the female wasps, and\r\nimpregnates them; the female wasps then escape from the Fig, those in\r\nthe _Profichi_ carrying pollen away with them as they pass out. They\r\nthen enter another Fig, lay their eggs, and die. The edible Fig-tree\r\nsimilarly has three crops in the year, _Fiori di fico_, _Pedagnuoli_,\r\n_Cimaruoli_. The wasps, entering these Figs, are unable to lay their\r\neggs in the ovary, but, nevertheless, they effect cross-pollination on\r\nentering the _Pedagnuoli_, which bear fertile seeds.]~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 345.--A Fig in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n   The flowers of _Brosimum_ are the most reduced. The perianth\r\n   is wanting, and the ♂-flower has only 1 stamen. _Cecropia_\r\n   (Trumpet-tree), in S. Am., has its pith divided into chambers;\r\n   these are inhabited by ants, which feed upon small food-bodies\r\n   formed on the swollen base of the petioles. The leaves are\r\n   petiolated, often shield-like, fringed or lobed, and sometimes\r\n   with white felted hairs. They serve as food for  _Bradypus_\r\n   (the Sloth). _Sorocea_; _Castilloa_.\r\n\r\n   About 300 species exclusively in the warmer climates. The white\r\n   Mulberry (_M. alba_, from China, India, Mongolia) is cultivated\r\n   for the sake of its leaves, which are the indispensable food\r\n   for silkworms. The black Mulberry (_M. nigra_, W. Asia) is\r\n   cultivated for its fruits, which are used for the officinal\r\n   Mulberry juice. The ordinary Fig-tree (_Ficus carica_) is from\r\n   the Mediterranean. The fruit of the well-known Oriental Sycamore\r\n   (_F. sycomorus_) is edible. The Bread-fruit tree (_Artocarpus\r\n   incisa_) and the Jack (_A. integrifolia_) have their home in the\r\n   South Sea Islands, and are cultivated in tropical countries.\r\n   The Bread-fruit is morphologically the same as the Mulberry. It\r\n   has a very large, spheroid inflorescence, whose floral-leaves\r\n   and perianth become fleshy and united into one nutritious mass,\r\n   together with the axis, which is also fleshy. The milky juice\r\n   of the India-rubber tree (_Ficus elastica_, East Indies, a\r\n   common house-plant), and of _Castilloa elastica_ (Am.) is the\r\n   raw material of India-rubber. The milky juice of _Galactodendron\r\n   utile_ (Cow-tree, S. Am.) is saccharine and nutritious, but in\r\n   _Antiaris toxicaria_ (the Upas-tree, of Java) it is a strong\r\n   poison. The bast of the Paper-Mulberry tree (_Br. papyrifera_,\r\n   Eastern Asia); is used in Japan for paper. Shellac is obtained\r\n   from a small, hemipterous insect (_Coccus lacca_), which lives\r\n   upon _Ficus laccifera_ and _F. religiosa_ (the Bo-tree, sacred\r\n   to Buddha), E. India. The wood of _Maclura aurantica_ (Am.) has\r\n   a yellow colour, and is known as yellow Brazilian wood.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Cannabaceæ.= The plants which belong to this order are\r\n_aromatic herbs_, either annuals or perennials, _without latex_.\r\nLeaves _palminerved_, and more or less divided, hispid, and with free,\r\npersistent stipules. Flowers always _diœcious_; ♂-flowers in panicles,\r\nformed of dichasia, passing over into uniparous scorpioid cymes. They\r\ndiffer from the Nettles, particularly in the 5-leaved perianth of the\r\n♂-flower, the 5 stamens (Fig. 346–351) with filaments _erect_ in the\r\nbud, and in the ♀-flower by the small, entire, cup-like perianth, which\r\nsurrounds the base of the ovary (Fig. 346, p. 352). The ovary has two\r\nstyles, or one divided into two, with two stigmas and a pendulous,\r\ncurved ovule (Fig. 346 _B_, 352 _B_); the fruit is a nut; the _embryo_\r\nis _curved_ (Hemp, Fig. 353), or rolled (Hop, Fig. 349), _without\r\nendosperm_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 346.--Diagram of male and female flowers of\r\n  the Hop and Hemp: _b_ the bract, _p_ the perianth. The position\r\n  of the embryo is indicated.]\r\n\r\nOnly 2 genera with 3 species (Asiatic), of which two are\r\ncultivated.--_Humulus lupulus_ (Hop, Figs. 347–349) is a twining,\r\nperennial plant, twisting to the right, with opposite, palmilobed,\r\nrough leaves, and large, interpetiolar stipules. The ♀-flowers are\r\nsituated in closely-flowered, cone-like, compound inflorescences, with\r\nultimately large, thin, imbricate floral-leaves (Fig. 348) which bear\r\nthe yellow, glandular hairs, containing lupulin. ~This inflorescence is\r\nmade up as follows:--The most external floral-leaves are situated in\r\npairs, and are the persistent stipules of a leaf, the blade of which\r\nhas become suppressed, or in any case is rudimentary. Such a pair of\r\nstipules supports 4 (2–6) flowers in a double uniparous cyme, whose\r\ncentral axis does not develope into a flower. The bracts of these\r\nflowers (bracteoles of the partial inflorescence) become, at maturity,\r\nvery large, spathe-like, and, together with the stipules, produce a\r\ncone-like appearance.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 347–348.--_Humulus lupulus_: 347, twining\r\n  stem; 348, branch with strobiles.]\r\n\r\n_Cannabis sativa_ (Hemp, Figs. 350–353) is an East Indian herb, with\r\npalmilobed leaves, and differs from the Hop in being annual, erect,\r\nand in having its leaves opposite at the base and scattered above.\r\nThe ♀-inflorescence is not cone-like as in the Hop, but the flowers\r\nare similar in construction. ~The main difference is to be found in\r\nthe axillary shoot, which was suppressed in the Hop, and is in the\r\nHemp developed into a leaf-bearing shoot which on each side bears only\r\none ♀-flower, and in the fact that the bracts are not so strongly\r\ndeveloped.~\r\n\r\n   The “Hops” (the female inflorescences) are used in brewing,\r\n   and medicinally on account of the yellow glands which contain\r\n   lupulin. The Indian variety of _Cannabis sativa_ contains\r\n   an abundance of glandular hairs and resin. The withered\r\n   inflorescences are used in medicine and are officinal. The bast\r\n   of the stems of the Hemp is also used and the fat oil of the\r\n   seeds. In Oriental countries the entire plant is used in the\r\n   preparation of an intoxicating drink (haschisch), the narcotic\r\n   material being found in the glandular hairs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 349.--_Humulus lupulus_: fruit in\r\n  longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 350–353.--_Cannabis sativa_:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 350, ♂-plant;\r\n\r\n  Fig. 351, ♂-flower;\r\n\r\n  Fig. 352, ♀-flower, entire and in longitudinal section;\r\n\r\n  Fig. 353, fruit in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 6. =Polygonifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThis family is on one side closely allied to the _Urticaceæ_ by its\r\nsolitary, _basal_, _vertical_, and _straight_ ovule, and by the conical\r\nocrea which envelopes the younger leaves in the bud, similar characters\r\nbeing present in the Urticaceæ. On the other side it is related to\r\nthe Curvembryæ. The flowers are small, often _trimerous_, regular and\r\nslightly perigynous (~in _Chloranthaceæ_, if they properly belong to\r\nthis family, and _Houttuynia_, more or less epigynous~). Syncarps are\r\npresent in some Piperaceæ, but the fruit is generally a single fruit,\r\none-seeded berry, nut or drupe. The leaves are generally scattered.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Polygonaceæ.= The majority are herbaceous plants with\r\nround, often jointed stems, scattered leaves and _ocrea_, that is a\r\nmembranous, tubular, ligular or stipular structure _inside_ the base\r\nof the leaf, which clasps the stem and axillary bud; the edges of the\r\nlamina are rolled backwards in the bud. The flowers are regular, small,\r\ngenerally ☿, slightly perigynous, with inconspicuous, simple, green or\r\nwhite perianth of 5–6 free segments; stamens 5–9 (Fig. 354) sometimes\r\narranged in two series; gynœceum 2–3 carpels, ovary _unilocular_ with\r\n_one basal_, _straight_ (orthotropous) _ovule_, 2–3 _free styles_.\r\nThe fruit is a 2–3-angular nut; the embryo, with mealy endosperm,\r\nis straight or curved (Fig. 355 _H_), often unsymmetrical.--~The\r\ninflorescences are compound, and generally branch from the axils of\r\nthe bracteoles, so that the last partial-inflorescences become coiled,\r\nuniparous scorpioid cymes; in _Polygonum_ the two bracteoles unite into\r\na membranous tube; in _Rheum_ and _Rumex_ there is only one bracteole.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 354.--_A_ Diagram of _Rheum_; _B_ of _Rumex_;\r\n  _C_ of _Polygonum fagopyrum_; _D_ of _P. lapathifolium_. The\r\n  ovules are indicated inside the ovaries; bracts and bracteoles\r\n  are not shown.]\r\n\r\n_Rheum_ (Rhubarb, Fig. 354 _A_) has a 6-leaved, _petaloid_ perianth (Pn\r\n3 + 3) and 9 stamens (A 3^2 + 3). The _3-winged_ nut is _not_ enclosed\r\nby the perianth.\r\n\r\n_Rumex_ (Dock, Fig. 354 _B_) has 6 stamens (A 3^2 + 0); the perianth is\r\n6-leaved (Pr 3 + 3), green or red, and the triangular nut is enveloped\r\nby the 3 interior perianth-leaves, which point upwards and continue to\r\ngrow after flowering. These perianth-leaves often have warts on their\r\nouter surface. ~The following are monœcious: _R. acetosa_ and _R.\r\nacetosella_.~\r\n\r\n_Polygonum_ (Knot-grass, Figs. 354 _C_, _D_; 355). The _petaloid_\r\nperianth is most frequently 5-merous (2/5 spiral); 5–8 stamens. The nut\r\nis triangular (Fig. 354 _C_, 355), or lenticular (Fig. 354 _D_). ~There\r\nare two whorls of stamens, the external with introrse, and the internal\r\nwith extrorse anthers. The gynœceum is often bicarpellate (Fig. 354\r\n_D_).~\r\n\r\n   The flowers may be considered as constructed upon the\r\n   monocotyledonous type. _Pterostegia_ has a perfectly\r\n   monocotyledonous flower with 5 trimerous whorls. _Rheum_\r\n   likewise, but here the external staminal whorl is doubled (Fig.\r\n   254 _A_). _Oxyria_ has a dimerous _Rheum_-flower (4-leaved\r\n   perianth, 6 stamens, 2 stigmas). _Rumex_ has a _Rheum_-flower\r\n   with the suppression of the internal whorl of stamens (Fig.\r\n   354 _B_); _Emex_ is a dimerous _Rumex_. _Polygonum_, to which\r\n   _Coccoloba_, _Muehlenbeckia_ and others are related, differs\r\n   from _Rheum_ chiefly in having one of the leaves, which in the\r\n   latter takes part in the formation of the perianth, developed\r\n   in this case into a bracteole (so that the perianth is reduced\r\n   to five members), and several or all the stamens in the inner\r\n   whorl become suppressed.--The perianth in _Coccoloba_ and\r\n   _Muehlenbeckia_ is more or less perigynous and becomes fleshy,\r\n   enclosing the fruit. _Muehlenbeckia platyclada_ has flat branches\r\n   with rudimentary leaves; sometimes branches with normal,\r\n   arrow-shaped leaves are found. _Atraphaxis._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 355.--_Polygonum fagopyrum_: _A_ branch\r\n  with flower and fruits (nat. size); _B_ flower; _C_ the same\r\n  in longitudinal section; _D_ anterior and posterior view of\r\n  stamen; _E_ gynœceum; _F_ fruit (mag.); _G_ fruit in longitudinal\r\n  section; _H_ transverse section, showing the curved cotyledons\r\n  embedded in the endosperm; _I_ the embryo.]\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. _Rumex_ is wind-pollinated, the stigmas are\r\n   therefore large and brush-like (indicated in  Fig. 354 _B_).\r\n   _Rheum_ and _Polygonum_ are insect-pollinated and have therefore\r\n   capitate stigmas, etc.; honey-glands are situated at the base\r\n   of the stamens (_d_, in Fig. 354 _C_, and _n_ in Fig. 356); a\r\n   few small-flowered _Polygonum_ species are self-pollinated;\r\n   Buckwheat (_P. fagopyrum_) is dimorphic and has long-styled and\r\n   short-styled flowers (Fig. 356). _Pol. bistorta_ is protandrous\r\n   and homostyled.\r\n\r\n   About 750 species, most of which are found in the temperate\r\n   regions of the Northern Hemisphere, some reaching as far as the\r\n   snow line or into the Arctic regions (_Oxyria_, _Kœnigia_).\r\n   Trees and shrubs are found in the Tropics: _Coccoloba_,\r\n   _Triplaris_. _Rheum_ is Central Asiatic.--The thick rhizomes of\r\n   _R. officinale_ (_Rhubarb_) are _officinal_. The rhizomes of the\r\n   ordinarily cultivated species, _R. undulatum_ and _rhaponticum_,\r\n   are used in veterinary medicine. The following are cultivated as\r\n   culinary plants for the sake of their leaves:--_Rumex acetosa_\r\n   (Sorrel), _R. patientia_, _R. scutatus_, and _Rheum undulatum_\r\n   (petioles). Several species of _Polygonum_ (_P. hydropiper_ and\r\n   others) have a sharp, pungent taste. “Buckwheat” is the mealy\r\n   fruit of _Polygonum fagopyrum_ (Central Asia) and is of value as\r\n   a farinaceous food. _P. cuspidatum_ (_P. sieboldi_, Japan) is an\r\n   ornamental plant.--_Calligonum_ in sandy and stony deserts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 356.--Flower of _Polygonum fagopyrum_ in\r\n  longitudinal section: 1, long-styled; 2, short-styled; _a_ the\r\n  anthers; _st_ the stigmas; _n_ nectary.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Piperaceæ (Peppers).= Shrubs or herbs, often with nodose,\r\njointed stem; leaves simple, entire, often with curved veins; stipules\r\nwanting (_Peperomia_) or intrapetiolar and cap-like, often enclosing\r\nthe terminal buds (_Piper_). The flowers in the group _Pipereæ_\r\n(_Piper_, Fig. 357, and _Peperomia_) are borne in spikes with fleshy\r\naxes (_club-like_), seldom in racemes, the outer ones are crowded and\r\nare ☿ or unisexual, always small, _naked_ and without bracteoles;\r\n~generally stamens 3 + 3, and gynœceum 3, but the number of the\r\nstamens may be reduced by suppression to 2, and the carpels to 1~. The\r\nflowers are situated in the axils of the small, generally shield-like\r\nfloral-leaves. The ovary is always _unilocular_ and has _one upright,\r\northotropous_ ovule. Fruit a berry or drupe. Both endosperm and\r\n_perisperm_ are present, the latter being especially well developed\r\n(Fig. 359).\r\n\r\n_Piper_; generally shrubs with scattered leaves, and terminal\r\ninflorescences which are crowded to one side by the development of the\r\nhighest lateral bud, so that they are situated opposite the leaves\r\n(Fig. 357). Many species have stems with an abnormal anatomical\r\nstructure.--_Peperomia_; chiefly succulent herbs, often epiphytes, with\r\nopposite or verticillate leaves having aqueous tissue on the upper side.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 357.--_Piper nigrum_: branch with fruit (½)]\r\n\r\n   The group _Saurureæ_ (considered by some as an order, and\r\n   perhaps representing a more original type) has 3–4 carpels\r\n   with many ovules. _Lactoris_ stands the highest with regular\r\n   3-merous perianth, 3 + 3 stamens and 3 carpels, which are\r\n   united at the base. Fruit a capsule with several seeds. (It\r\n   has one species from the island of Juan Fernandez, and is also\r\n   placed in an order of its own, Lactoridaceæ, allied to the\r\n   Magnoliaceæ, through _Drimys_).--_Saururus_ has naked flowers;\r\n   most frequently 6 stamens, and 4 carpels, free or united at\r\n   the base, each with 2-4 orthotropous ovules. Fruit, small\r\n   berries.--_Houttuynia_; stamens situated a little upward on the\r\n   ovaries; placentation parietal; capsule many-seeded.\r\n\r\n   About 1,000 species; entirely tropical, especially from\r\n   South America and East India. They are found chiefly among\r\n   the underwood in damp, shady places; some, which are fleshy\r\n   (_Peperomia_), live as epiphytes on trees; a few climb by\r\n   roots.--USES. Several Piperaceæ are used medicinally and\r\n   for spices on account of their pungent properties and the\r\n   essential oils found in nearly all parts of the plant. The\r\n   following are _officinal_: “Black-pepper” (the unripe, dried\r\n   fruits) and “White-pepper” (the seeds of the ripe fruits) of\r\n   _Piper nigrum_ (climbing shrub, East Indian); “Cubeb” berries\r\n   of _P. cubeba_ (climbing shrub, Java). “Long-pepper” is the\r\n   unripe inflorescence of _P. longum_, East India. The leaves of\r\n   _P. angustifolia_ (Matico) are officinal. The leaves of the\r\n   Betelpepper (East India) are used together with the nuts of\r\n   the Areca-palm to form the well-known East Indian intoxicating\r\n   compound “Betel.” A good many others are also used.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 358.--_Piper nigrum_ (Diagram). In addition\r\n  to the bract there are two structures resembling bracteoles.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 359.--_Piper nigrum_: Fruit in longitudinal\r\n  section, showing the endosperm, perisperm, and pericarp.]\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Chloranthaceæ.= (_Chloranthus_, _Hedyosmum_) have\r\n   opposite leaves, with stipules more or less united at the base,\r\n   and inferior “drupes.” Ovules pendulous. Only endosperm. About\r\n   33 species, Tropical.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 7. =Curvembryæ.=\r\n\r\nThe plants in this family have a _curved ovule_, and most frequently\r\na _kidney-shaped seed_ (generally provided with fine, cuticular,\r\nprojecting warts, Fig. 362 _B_), with a _curved, peripheral embryo\r\nenclosing the endosperm which is most frequently floury_ (Figs. 362\r\n_C_, 365 _H_; for exceptions, see Fig. 366); the seeds in all cases\r\nare borne on a _centrally-placed_, and in most cases _free_, placenta\r\n(they are “basal” when there is only 1 ovule in the ovary, Fig. 364).\r\nThe flower is regular, hypogynous or perigynous (Fig. 364) (only\r\nrarely epigynous) and usually 5-_merous_. The flower which is most\r\ncomplete has 5 whorls (S5, P5, A5+5, G2-3–5), as in some genera of\r\nthe Caryophyllaceæ (Figs. 360, 361); but from this type it becomes\r\nreduced, the petals and stamens being suppressed, so that finally\r\n5 perianth-leaves, 5 stamens (opposite the perianth-leaves), and 2\r\ncarpels (Fig. 361 _F_) only are present; for example, in certain genera\r\nof the _Caryophyllaceæ_, in the _Chenopodiaceæ_, _Amarantaceæ_, and\r\nothers. When the number of stamens is increased to more than 5 in the\r\nwhorl, it is always possible to show that some of the stamens have been\r\ndivided. The number of the carpels and ovules also becomes reduced; in\r\nthe highest there is a central placenta, not free in its early stages,\r\nwith a large number of ovules; in those which are most reduced there is\r\nonly a single ovule, which is placed centrally at the base of the ovary\r\n[Fig. 364]. Somewhat corresponding changes are found in the fruit,\r\nwhich is a many-seeded _capsule_ in those which have many ovules, but\r\na one-seeded _nut_ where there is one ovule. In the most reduced forms\r\nthe flowers are generally unisexual.--Similar features are also present\r\nin the vegetative parts. Almost all the species are herbaceous, the\r\nleaves are simple and most frequently without stipules. ~The structure\r\nof the stem, especially in Chenopodiaceæ, Amarantaceæ, Nyctaginiaceæ\r\nand others, often differs from that of the ordinary Dicotyledon. In the\r\nwoody portion of the stem and root several rings are sometimes formed\r\nwhich resemble annual rings but which are formed by new cambium-rings\r\narising outside the old ones which then cease to divide.~\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Caryophyllaceæ.= Herbaceous plants, with round, nodose\r\nstem; leaves _opposite_, slightly amplexicaul, simple, with sessile,\r\nundivided, entire lamina; stipules nearly always absent; the\r\ninflorescences are _dichasia_ passing over into unipared scorpioid\r\ncymes. The flowers are regular, ☿ or unisexual, hypogynous or\r\nperigynous, 5-(or 4-) merous with 2–3–4–5 carpels; calyx persistent;\r\ncorolla polypetalous. The ovary is unilocular (or originally, and\r\nsometimes also in the later stages, plurilocular below, _e.g._\r\n_Viscaria_), with _free styles_ and 1–several curved ovules on a\r\n_central_, free placenta. The fruit is a nut or a capsule opening\r\napically with long or short valves (teeth, Fig. 362), equal to or\r\ndouble the carpels. For the seeds refer to the family. ~In _Dianthus_\r\nthe embryo is straight.~\r\n\r\n   The flowers which are most complete have _Sn_, _Pn_, _An_ + _n_\r\n   (obdiplostemonous), _Gn_ where _n_ = 5 (Figs. 360, 361 _A_) or\r\n   4 (Fig. 361 _B_); the carpels may be placed opposite to the\r\n   sepals (Fig. 360) or opposite to the petals (Fig. 361 _A_, _B_).\r\n   Without any change taking place in the position of the other\r\n   whorls, the carpels are next found reduced to 2–3–4 (see the\r\n   genera); their number may easily be recognised by that of the\r\n   styles. This is the construction in the majority of the genera\r\n   in the two first groups. _Stellaria media_ differs considerably.\r\n   It may have (_a_) the flower as described above, with _G3_;\r\n   (_b_), the corolla only absent, or (_c_) only the petal-stamens\r\n   (A5 + 0, Fig. 361 _C_), or (_d_) all these as well as some of\r\n   the sepal-stamens. The same applies to _Sagina_, _Alsine_,\r\n   _Cerastium_, and others, and, finally, a series of genera are\r\n   formed, with certain conditions of reduction which have become\r\n   constant, and by a gradual series of steps lead to the most\r\n   reduced form, which has only 5 sepals and 5 (or even as far as\r\n   only 1) sepal-stamens (Fig. 361 _D_, _E_, _F_).--The PETALS in\r\n   the _Alsineæ_ are often deeply bifid. The sepal-stamens are most\r\n   frequently the longest, and bear nectaries at the base (Fig. 363\r\n   _st_). In the most complete forms the ovary has partition-walls\r\n   in the lower portion (Fig. 360); these do not, however, reach\r\n   to the top, and generally soon disappear. The ovules, when\r\n   numerous, are situated on the placenta in as many double rows as\r\n   there are carpels. In the number of ovules a reduction from many\r\n   to 1 takes place (Fig. 361). A comparison proves that the “free,\r\n   centrally placed” placenta is formed by the ventral portion of\r\n   the carpels. The single basal ovule in _Herniaria_ (Fig. 364),\r\n   _Scleranthus_, and others, is also borne on the carpels.\r\n\r\n   The vegetative _branching_ is characteristic. One of the leaves\r\n   in a pair is formed before the other, and has a more vigorous\r\n   axillary bud; these stronger leaves stand in a ¼-spiral, the\r\n   fifth above the first one, and the branches are consequently\r\n   arranged in the same manner. In the inflorescence, however, it\r\n   is the upper or second bracteole (β) whose axillary bud (_w_ in\r\n   Fig. 361) is most advanced. The bud of the first bracteole (α)\r\n   becomes sometimes entirely suppressed, or in some this bracteole\r\n   itself is suppressed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 360.--Diagram of _Lychnis_: α, β bracteoles.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 361.--_A-F_ Diagrams of flowers of the\r\n  Caryophyllaceæ: _A Agrostemma_; _B Sagina_; _C Stellaria_;\r\n  _D Corrigiola_; _E Paronychia_; _F Herniaria_.]\r\n\r\n   The most original type appears to be represented by the Alsineæ.\r\n   From this form on one side the Sileneæ, adapted in a higher\r\n   degree for insect-pollination, are developed, and on the other\r\n   side the Paronychieæ, with various reductions.\r\n\r\n=1.= ALSINEÆ, STITCHWORT GROUP. Sepals free, and connected with them\r\nstellately expanded, slightly unguiculate (white or inodorous) petals;\r\nthese, however, often become suppressed (Fig. 363). The fruit is a\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 362.--_Cerastium arvense_: _A_ fruit; _B_\r\n  seed; _C_ section of seed.]\r\n\r\n=a.= As many carpels as sepals (4 or 5). _Cerastium_ (Chickweed). The\r\npetals are bifid. Capsule cylindrical, frequently _curved_ at the top,\r\nand opening by 10 teeth (Fig. 362).--~_Malachium_ differs only in the\r\n5-toothed capsule with bifid teeth.~--_Spergula_ (Spurry). The petals\r\nare not bifid, capsule 5-valved; seeds winged. The leaves are linear,\r\nand appear as if placed in large numbers in a whorl, a branch being\r\nsituated in the axil of each with leaves placed very close together at\r\nits base; _stipules membranous_.--~Sagina has Sn, Pn, An + n, or An,\r\nGn, where n = 4 or 5. The corolla is often wanting.~\r\n\r\n=b.= 3 (rarely 2) carpels (Fig. 361 _C_). _Stellaria_ (Stitchwort)\r\nhas deeply cleft petals. The number of stamens varies (see\r\nabove).--_Arenaria_ has entire petals. ~(To this group belong _Alsine_,\r\n_Moehringia_, _Halianthus_, or _Honckenya_ (Fig. 363), which differ\r\nfrom each other, especially in the form of the seed and number of\r\nthe capsular valves.) _Spergularia_ has membranous stipules, as in\r\n_Spergula_.--_Holosteum._~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 363.--_Arenaria_ (_Halianthus_) _peploides_:\r\n  ♀-(_A_) and ♂-flower (_B_, _C_).]\r\n\r\n=2.= PARONYCHIEÆ (Figs. 361 _D_, _E_, _F_; 364). Small, greenish\r\nplants. The leaves, in the majority, are opposite, with _membranous\r\nstipules_. The flowers are most frequently arranged in small\r\n_dichasia_; they are small and insignificant, perigynous (Fig. 364)\r\nor hypogynous. The corolla is in most cases wanting, and when present\r\nis very small; in general the calyx-stamens are developed, but the\r\ncorolla-stamens may be represented by small scales (Fig. 364). Ovary\r\nmost frequently with 1 ovule. Fruit, a _nut_, rarely a capsule; it is\r\nenclosed by the strongly perigynous floral axis (torus).\r\n\r\n_Scleranthus_ (Knapwell) is perigynous with bell-shaped torus; no\r\ncorolla; corolla-stamens are wanting or rudimentary; some calyx-stamens\r\nmay also be absent.--_Corrigiola_ (Fig. 361 _D_); _Illecebrum_;\r\n_Paronychia_ (Fig. 361 _E_); _Herniaria_ (Figs. 361 _F_, 364).\r\n\r\n=3.= SILENEÆ, PINK OR CARNATION GROUP. This has a _gamosepalous_ calyx\r\nand unguiculate, white or red, petals, with _outgrowths_ (_ligule_,\r\n_corona_, _paracorolla_) at the throat of the corolla. These structures\r\nare not found in the other groups, and are merely outgrowths at\r\nthe junction of the limb and claw. The corolla, stamens and ovary\r\nare frequently raised above the calyx, upon a lengthened internode\r\n(_gynophore_). The flower has S5, P5, A5 + 5; fruit a capsule with many\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n=a.= 5-(rarely 3–4) carpellate ovary.--_Lychnis_ (Campion, Fig. 360).\r\nThe corolla is longer than the calyx; corona present. The capsule\r\nis 10- or 5-toothed, completely 1-chambered or 5-chambered at the\r\nbase,--the genus has been divided accordingly into several genera:\r\n_Melandrium_, _Lychnis_, _Viscaria_. ~Some species are unisexual by\r\nthe abortion of stamens or carpels (_L. vespertina_, _diurna_).~\r\n_Agrostemma_ (_A. githago_, Corn-cockle, Fig. 361 _A_) has a\r\nlong-toothed calyx, the teeth exceeding the corolla; corona absent;\r\n5-toothed capsule.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 364.--_Herniaria glabra_: _a^1_ flower; _b^1_\r\n  longitudinal section through the flower; _c^1_ stigma with two\r\n  pollen-grains.]\r\n\r\n=b.= Tricarpellate.--_Silene_ (Catch-fly). Six-toothed capsule; corona\r\npresent in the majority.--~_Cucubalus_ has berry-like fruits which\r\nfinally become dry but do not dehisce.~\r\n\r\n=c.= Bicarpellate (2 styles, 4-toothed capsule).--_Dianthus_\r\n(Pink); at the base of the calyx 1–several pairs of floral-leaves\r\nare situated; corona absent. The _straight embryo_ is a peculiar\r\nexception.--_Gypsophila_ has a campanulate, open calyx, 5-nerved,\r\nmembranous between the nerves; corona absent; the flowers are generally\r\nsmall and numerous, in a large, paniculate dichasia.--_Saponaria_\r\n(Soapwort) has corona.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. _Alsineæ_ has ordinary nectaries at the base of\r\n   the calyx-stamens (Fig. 336): they are frequently protandrous\r\n   but may often, in the absence of cross-pollination (in the\r\n   less conspicuous species) pollinate themselves. Their open\r\n   flowers are accessible to many kinds of insects (particularly\r\n   flies and bees). _Gynodiœcious_ flowers are found in several\r\n   species, and the ☿-flowers are then generally more conspicuous\r\n   than the ♀-flowers. That the ♀-flowers have descended from\r\n   ☿-flowers is seen by the large staminodes found in them (Fig.\r\n   363). _Arenaria peploides_ is diœcious (Fig. 363). The _Sileneæ_\r\n   are as a rule adapted for pollination by insects with long\r\n   probosces--especially butterflies,--and they are frequently\r\n   protandrous, so that at first the calyx-stamens open, later\r\n   on the corolla-stamens, then the stigmas expand. The honey is\r\n   secreted by a ring-like nectary round the base of the ovary or\r\n   by nectaries at the base of the stamens. Some only blossom and\r\n   emit scent at night or in the evening (_Lychnis vespertina_,\r\n   _Silene nutans_, _Saponaria officinalis_) and, like other\r\n   night-flowers, are of a white or pale colour.\r\n\r\n   DISTRIBUTION. 1,100 species, especially in temperate climates,\r\n   fewer in the colder zone, less still in the Tropics. The\r\n   Paronychieæ are especially found in dry, sandy fields.\r\n\r\n   USES. “Soap-root” (with _Saponin_, forming a lather in water)\r\n   from _Saponaria officinalis_ was formerly officinal, and\r\n   _Gypsophila struthium_. The seeds of _Agrostemma githago_ are\r\n   said to be poisonous.--The following are ornamental plants:\r\n   species of Pinks (_D. caryophyllus_, garden Pink, often\r\n   with double flowers; _D. barbatus_, _plumarius_, _etc._).\r\n   _Lychnis_, _Gypsophila_, _Silene_, _Cerastium_ (_C. tomentosum_\r\n   as edging for borders), _Saponaria officinalis_ (often\r\n   coronate).--_Spergula arvensis_ is sometimes cultivated.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Amarantaceæ.= The flowers are essentially the same as\r\n   in the _Chenopodiaceæ_ and the extremely reduced Caryophyllaceæ\r\n   (Fig. 361 _F_); they are regular, hypogynous, generally ☿,\r\n   have 5 free (rarely slightly united) perianth-leaves; in front\r\n   of these 5 stamens, which _are often united_ at their base\r\n   into a shorter or longer tube and have stipule-like teeth\r\n   between them (the division _Gomphreneæ_ has 2-locular anthers,\r\n   each of which opens longitudinally); and a 2–3 carpellate\r\n   gynœceum with one loculus and most frequently one, more rarely\r\n   several ovules; the fruit is a nut, more rarely (in _Celosia_,\r\n   _Amarantus_, _Gomphrena_) a capsule, dehiscing irregularly,\r\n   or like a pyxidium. The characters which especially separate\r\n   them from the allied orders are found in the perianth. The\r\n   perianth-leaves are not green and herbaceous, but _membranous,\r\n   dry, and often coloured_; they are frequently produced into a\r\n   bristle or awn; they have also both subtending floral-leaves\r\n   and _2 large bracteoles similar to the perianth_; all these dry\r\n   leaves persist without alteration after the withering of the\r\n   flower.--The flowers are without scent. They are arranged in\r\n   spike- or capitulum-like inflorescences; sometimes placed singly,\r\n   sometimes aggregated in the panicle-like inflorescences; in\r\n   others, on the contrary, in dichasia. The majority are herbs,\r\n   some are shrubs. The leaves are scattered, or opposite, but\r\n   always simple and without stipules; some are smooth, others\r\n   hairy.\r\n\r\n   450 species; especially in the Tropics, principally S. Am. and\r\n   E. Ind.: few are found outside these countries.--Only a few\r\n   are used; some, chiefly E. Indian species, are cultivated as\r\n   ornamental plants: _Amaranthus_ (Fox-tail); _Gomphrena globosa_;\r\n   _Celosia cristata_ (Cock’s-comb) remarkable for its fasciated\r\n   inflorescence; _Alternanthera_. Some are employed as culinary\r\n   plants in the Tropics, and in a few of the E. Indian species the\r\n   seeds are farinaceous, and used for food.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Chenopodiaceæ.= Generally herbaceous plants like the\r\nCaryophyllaceæ, but the leaves are arranged spirally (except\r\n_Salicornia_), and are simple, exstipulate; they are generally fleshy\r\nand like the stem “mealy,” that is, covered with small hairs, whose\r\nlarge spherical terminal cell readily falls away; otherwise they are\r\nseldom hairy. The inflorescences are generally flower-clusters borne in\r\npanicles. Bracteoles generally absent. Flowers generally _unisexual_:\r\nwith the single exception of _Beta_ the flowers are hypogynous; they\r\nare regular, small and inconspicuous, with _single, green_, 5-leaved,\r\nbut _more or less united_ perianth; 5 stamens opposite the perianth,\r\nand a _2–5-carpellate, unilocular_ ovary with 1 basal, curved ovule;\r\nbut in some genera the number of the perianth-leaves and stamens is\r\nreduced to 3–2–1–0. The fruit is generally a _nut_,--thus this flower\r\nand fruit are the same as in the reduced Caryophyllaceæ (Fig. 361\r\n_F_). The seed is similar to that generally found in the family (for\r\nexceptions see the genera).\r\n\r\n   The floral diagram most frequently present is the same as\r\n   in Fig. 361 _F_. There is no indication of corolla or of\r\n   corolla-stamens, which may be supposed to have belonged\r\n   to the plant, but which are now entirely and completely\r\n   suppressed. This order appears to have been an offshoot from\r\n   the Caryophyllaceæ.--The perianth persists after the withering\r\n   of the flower, and envelopes the nut; it is very variable, and,\r\n   together with the position of the seed, the form of the embryo,\r\n   the sex of the flowers, etc., gives the characters of the genera.\r\n\r\n=1.= CHENOPODIEÆ, GOOSEFOOT GROUP (Fig. 365), has ☿ (or polygamous)\r\nflowers, with regular 5-parted perianth (_C_); the embryo is ring-like\r\n(_H_). The leaves have the ordinary flat forms.--_Chenopodium_\r\n(Goosefoot). The flower is hypogynous, and the fruit (which is\r\ncompressed) perfectly free; Mulberry-like collections of fruits are\r\nformed in some species (sub-genus _Blitum_) by the perianth becoming\r\nfinally fleshy and coloured.--_Beta_ (Beet, Mangold, Fig. 365) differs\r\nfrom all genera in the perianth, which finally becomes cartilaginous,\r\nbeing epigynous (_D_). Small, most frequently 2–3-flowered clusters\r\nwithout bracteoles, situated in a long, interrupted axis (_A_, _B_);\r\nthe flowers and fruits in each cluster are more or less united\r\nindividually, and fall off together--they are commonly known as seeds\r\n(_E_, _F_). The seed lies horizontally.--_Hablitzia_ (_H. tamnoides_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 365.--_Beta vulgaris._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 366.--_Salsola soda_: embryo.]\r\n\r\n=2.= SALSOLEÆ, SALTWORT GROUP, has cylindrical or semi-cylindrical\r\nleaves. Perianth as in the preceding group; the fruit is most\r\nfrequently compressed. The two first mentioned genera differ from\r\nmost of the others in the order in having a spirally-coiled, and not\r\na ring-like embryo, so that the endosperm is slight or wanting (Fig.\r\n366). These plants are sometimes placed as a group by themselves,\r\nSPIROLOBEÆ--in contradistinction to which the others are termed\r\nCYCLOLOBEÆ.--_Salsola_ (Saltwort); leaves subulate, with spiny tips;\r\nthe flowers have 2 spinous bracteoles: during the ripening of the\r\nfruit a tough leathery wing is developed transversely to the back of\r\nthe perianth.--~_Chenopodina_ deviates from _Chenopodium_ chiefly in\r\nthe embryo and want of endosperm.--_Kochia_ has a somewhat similar\r\nperianth to _Salsola_, but a ring-like embryo; it differs from the\r\nothers in being hairy.~\r\n\r\n=3.= SALICORNIEÆ, GLASSWORT GROUP. _Salicornia_ (Glasswort) has a very\r\ndifferent appearance. The stems are succulent, jointed, and almost\r\nleafless; the leaves opposite, very small, sheath-like and connate;\r\nthere is a depression in the axil of each leaf, in which a small\r\n3-flowered dichasium without bracteoles is sunk; the flowers have\r\na trimerous perianth, 1–2 stamens and 1 carpel. No endosperm. _S.\r\nherbacea_ on clayey beaches.\r\n\r\n=4.= ATRIPLICEÆ. This group has most frequently unisexual flowers;\r\nthe ♂-flower has a 4–5 partite perianth, but the ♀-flower differs\r\nfrom it. _Atriplex_ is monœcious or polygamous, the ♀-flower is\r\nnaked, but has 2 large, herbaceous bracteoles which expand during the\r\nripening of the fruit, and often become warted and fringed, enveloping\r\nthe _compressed nut_. ~The section _Dichospermum_ has two kinds of\r\n♀-flowers, one like those just described, the other similar to the\r\n_Chenopodium_-flowers, which have been deprived of their stamens, and\r\nthe fruits of which are _depressed_, not pressed together from the\r\nsides; some (_e.g. A. hortensis_) have even three kinds of nuts.\r\nAll the flowers of _Atriplex_, which present vertical fruits, are\r\naccessory shoots, which stand beneath the ordinary flower-clusters, a\r\nrather singular relation.~--_Spinacia_ (Spinach) is diœcious; ♂-flower:\r\nperianth, 4 (-5); stamens, 4 (-5); ♀-flower: tubular, 2–4-partite\r\nperianth, hardening during the ripening of the fruit, and uniting with\r\nthe compressed nut; in _S. oleracea_, it also forms _thorns_; 4 long\r\nstigmas.--_Halimus_ has the 2 long bracteoles almost entirely united\r\nand ultimately adhering firmly to the fruit.\r\n\r\n   =5.= BASELLEÆ. A somewhat exceptional group with more\r\n   or less perigynous flowers and 2 bracteoles. _Basella_,\r\n   _Boussingaultia_, _Ullucus_. The perianth is sepaloid; ovary\r\n   1-ovuled. In _Basella_ the perianth is fleshy, enveloping the\r\n   nut, and the cotyledons are so rolled together that a tranverse\r\n   cut divides them in two places (as in Spirolobeæ). Herbaceous\r\n   climbing plants.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. Wind-and self-pollination, as far as is known;\r\n   the insignificant flowers, devoid of honey, appear to exclude\r\n   insect-pollination.--520 species. Most of them are annual\r\n   (out of 26 native species only 5 are perennial); inhabiting\r\n   salt-marshes and salt-steppes, and growing as weeds (most\r\n   frequently on garden or field soil containing manure) in this\r\n   country, especially species of _Chenopodium_ and _Atriplex_.\r\n   The majority are found outside the Tropics, and play a very\r\n   important part, for example, in the Asiatic salt-steppes. They\r\n   grow gregariously in large masses.\r\n\r\n   USES. Comparatively few. The only important one is _Beta\r\n   vulgaris_ (from the Mediterranean basin), with its different\r\n   varieties, viz. Beet-root, Cattle-beet or Red-beet, Sugar-beet,\r\n   and others. These are biennial, making in the first year a root\r\n   which acts as a reservoir of reserve material, with a rosette\r\n   of leaves, and in the second year using this material in the\r\n   production of a long stem, leaves and flowers. The primary\r\n   root has been developed by cultivation into a very thick and\r\n   fleshy tap-root; its mode of increase in thickness deviates\r\n   from that of other roots, concentric rings of vascular bundles\r\n   being formed from a cambial ring developed outside the previous\r\n   ring. In this way several rings of vascular bundles separated\r\n   by medullary rays, alternating with rings of parenchyma, may\r\n   be found in the root of a Beet. Besides _Beta vulgaris_, var.\r\n   _hortensis_ (Beet-root), the following are also cultivated: var.\r\n   _cicla_ (Leaf-beet, “Mangold,” or “Roman Spinach ”), _Spinacia\r\n   oleracea_ and _Atriplex hortensis_ as Spinach; a form of the\r\n   latter and of Spinach are grown as ornamental plants. The tubers\r\n   of _Ullucus tuberosus_ are used as potatoes; _Chenopodium\r\n   quinoa_, in Chili and Peru, is an important farinaceous plant.\r\n   Soda is made from some (_Salsola kali_, _Chenopodina maritima_\r\n   and others). Aromatic properties are rare: _Chenopodium\r\n   ambrosioides_ and _botrys_.\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Batidaceæ.= _Batis maritima_, a bushy West Indian\r\n   maritime plant.\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Phytolaccaceæ.= The ☿ (sometimes unisexual), regular,\r\n   sometimes slightly perigynous flowers are inconspicuous\r\n   and have a single sepaloid or coloured 4–5-leaved perianth\r\n   (generally united at the base); stamens either in 1 whorl in the\r\n   spaces between the perianth-leaves or in 1 whorl opposite the\r\n   perianth-leaves, or in 2, one of which alternates with these;\r\n   but the number may be increased by the splitting of one or of\r\n   both the whorls to as many as 10–15–20–25. _Carpels_ sometimes\r\n   only one, sometimes _many_ (4–10) placed in a whorl, either free\r\n   or united into a gynœceum with a corresponding number of loculi\r\n   in the ovary; but in all cases _each carpel bears only its own\r\n   style and 1 ovule_. The fruit is a _berry_ (or nut, capsule, or\r\n   schizocarp).--Mostly herbs or herbaceous shrubs, with scattered,\r\n   simple leaves without stipules (_Petiverieæ_; have stipules).\r\n   Inflorescences, most frequently _racemes_ or spikes, which in\r\n   some instances are apparently placed opposite to a leaf, being\r\n   displaced by a more vigorous growth of the axillary bud. Embryo\r\n   always bent.--_Petiveria_ has a straight embryo with rolled\r\n   cotyledons.--_Phytolacca_, _Pircunia_, _Microtea_, _Seguieria_,\r\n   _Rivina_ (Pr4, A4, G1; berry), and others.\r\n\r\n   The following plant is, with some doubt, placed near this\r\n   order: _Thelygonum cynocrambe_; monœcious. ♂-flowers: perianth,\r\n   2-leaved; stamens indefinite. ♀-flowers: perianth-leaves united,\r\n   3-toothed; G1, style gynobasic. Fruit a drupe. An annual plant;\r\n   Mediterranean. Branching anomalous.\r\n\r\n   About 90 species; in tropical and temperate countries,\r\n   principally America and Africa.--The red juice in the fruits,\r\n   especially of _Phytol. decandra_, is used for colouring wine.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Portulacaceæ= (=Portulacas=). The flowers are regular\r\n(except _Montia_), hypogynous (except _Portulaca_) and ☿. The diagram\r\nwhich applies to the majority of genera is that in Fig. 367, but with\r\nall the 5 stamens completely developed: it may be considered as the\r\nChenopodiaceous diagram with the addition of 2 _bracteoles_ in the\r\nmedian line (_m-n_, these by some are considered as sepals), and with\r\na petaloid perianth (usually designated “corolla”). The “petals” fall\r\noff very quickly, and are sometimes wanting. Most frequently 5 stamens,\r\nsituated opposite the “petals,” but in other genera the number varies;\r\n_Montia_ has only 3 stamens (by suppression of the two anterior and\r\nlateral, Fig. 367), others again have more than 5, some a large and\r\nindefinite number. This may be explained partly by the appearance of\r\na second whorl of stamens alternating with the first, and partly by\r\nthe splitting (dédoublement) of the stamens. Gynœceum most frequently\r\ntricarpellate, ovary unilocular with 1–several basal ovules (sometimes\r\non a branched placenta, as in certain _Caryophyllaceæ_). The fruit is\r\na _capsule_, more rarely a nut.--The majority are annual herbaceous\r\nplants with scattered, entire leaves, often fleshy and smooth, with or\r\nwithout rudimentary stipules (dry, membranous, modified into hairs).\r\nInflorescence cymose.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 367.--_Montia._\r\n\r\n  Diagram of flower.]\r\n\r\n_Portulaca_ (Portulaca): flower, epigynous or semi-epigynous; fruit, a\r\npyxidium. The stamens vary in number, and are most frequently placed in\r\ngroups (in consequence of splitting) opposite the petals.--_Montia_:\r\nthe corolla is slightly gamopetalous, but cleft on the posterior side\r\n(Fig. 367), and as a consequence of the larger size of the lateral\r\npetals, slightly zygomorphic; 3 stamens.--_Calandrinia_; _Talinum_;\r\n_Anacampseros_; _Claytonia_.\r\n\r\n   125 species; mostly in warm and temperate countries, especially\r\n   the arid parts of S. Am. and the Cape. _Montia fontana_ (Blinks)\r\n   is a native plant. _Portulaca oleracea_ is cultivated as a\r\n   pot-herb in the south of Europe. A few species of _Portulaca_\r\n   and _Calandrinia_ are ornamental plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 7. =Nyctaginiaceæ.= The characteristic feature of this order\r\nis the _single_, regular, _united_, and often petaloid perianth, the\r\nlower part of which generally persists after flowering and embraces\r\nthe fruit as a false pericarp. The upper portion is most frequently\r\n_valvate and folded_, or simply valvate in æstivation. The number of\r\nstamens varies. The free gynœceum is _unicarpellate_ and has 1 ovule.\r\nThe fruit is a _nut_, but becomes a _false drupe_, since the lower\r\npersistent portion of the perianth becomes fleshy (as in _Neea_, where\r\nthis fleshy part is almost always crowned by the upper persistent\r\npart of the perianth. In the majority of the Mirabileæ the lower part\r\nbecomes the dry _anthocarp_, while the upper petaloid part falls away\r\nafter flowering). Finally, a peculiar involucre is formed around the\r\nflowers by free or united floral-leaves.--The majority are herbs, some\r\nare trees (_Pisonia_, etc.); _Bougainvillea_ is a liane. The stems\r\nare often nodose and swollen at the nodes; the leaves are simple,\r\npenninerved, scattered, or opposite, without stipules. ~In some, the\r\nvascular bundles are scattered; stem anomalous.~\r\n\r\n_Mirabilis_; the structure of the stem is abnormal. Dichasial branching\r\nwith continuation from the second bracteole, thus forming unipared\r\nscorpioid cymes. The perianth is petaloid, funnel-shaped, and has\r\na folded and twisted æstivation resembling that of the corolla of\r\nthe _Convolvulaceæ_; the upper coloured portion falls off after\r\nthe flowering. Outside, and alternating with it, is a 5-partite,\r\nsepaloid involucre of 5 spirally-placed floral-leaves.--_Oxybaphus_;\r\nthe involucre envelops 1–3 dichasial flowers.--_Bougainvillea_; the\r\ninvolucre is rose-coloured, 3-leaved, and envelops 3 flowers (placed\r\nlaterally; the terminal flower wanting). The leaves of the involucre\r\nin _Boerhaavia_, _Pisonia_, _Neea_, and others are reduced to teeth or\r\nscales.\r\n\r\n   157 species; mostly in tropical countries, and especially S. Am.\r\n   Species of _Mirabilis_ (Am.) are ornamental plants. Theïn is\r\n   found in _Neea theïfera_ Oersted (discovered by Lund in Lagoa\r\n   Santa, Brazil), which may be used as a tea-plant.\r\n\r\n   Order 8. =Aizoaceæ.= Only 3 _whorls_ are found in the flower,\r\n   which _alternate_ with one another when their leaves are equal\r\n   in number. The first is sepaloid, the third one the carpels,\r\n   and the intervening one is either uncleft, in which case it is\r\n   developed as stamens, or it is divided into a large number of\r\n   members which then all become stamens (arranged in groups), or\r\n   the outermost ones become developed as petals. The fruit is most\r\n   frequently a capsule with several loculi. Most of the species\r\n   are herbs with thick, fleshy stems, and exstipulate leaves. The\r\n   structure of the stem is usually anomalous.\r\n\r\n   =1.= AIZOIDEÆ have hypogynous or perigynous flowers with (4–)\r\n   5 perianth-leaves; stamens single, or (by splitting) in groups\r\n   of 2–3, alternating with the perianth-leaves. The gynœceum\r\n   (with 3–5 carpels) has 3–5 loculi in the ovary, and most\r\n   frequently numerous ovules in each loculus, borne on the central\r\n   placenta formed by the edges of the carpels. The fruit is a\r\n   capsule. The inflorescences are dichasia and unipared scorpioid\r\n   cymes.--_Aizoon_, _Mollugo_, _Sesuvium_, and others are herbs or\r\n   bushes, most frequently hairy.\r\n\r\n   =2.= MESEMBRIANTHEMEÆ have semi- or wholly-epigynous\r\n   flowers.--_Tetragonia._ The perianth is 4 (more rarely\r\n   3–5–6)-merous. Stamens single, or (by splitting) in groups\r\n   alternating with the perianth-leaves. There is an indefinite\r\n   number of carpels, and each loculus of the ovary contains\r\n   _only_ 1 pendulous ovule. Fruit a nut or drupe. The flowers\r\n   arise singly in the leaf-axils, with an accessory foliage-bud\r\n   below them; in some instances there is also an accessory\r\n   flower between this bud and the flower. Southern hemisphere,\r\n   especially at the Cape; _T. expansa_, New Zealand Spinach, is a\r\n   fleshy plant which is cultivated as a pot-herb (Japan, Austr.,\r\n   S. Am.).--_Mesembrianthemum_: the flowers are 5-merous; the\r\n   numerous linear petals and the still more numerous stamens all\r\n   arise by the splitting of 5 or 4 protuberances (primordia)\r\n   alternating with the sepals. The ovary presents another\r\n   characteristic peculiarity: the carpels alternating with the\r\n   5–4 stamens form an ovary (with several loculi) with the ovules\r\n   at first borne, as in other cases, on the _inner_ corner of the\r\n   inwardly-turned carpels; but during the subsequent development\r\n   the whole ovary is so turned round that the placentæ become\r\n   parietal and the ovules assume, apparently, a position very\r\n   rarely met with in the vegetable kingdom: on the dorsal suture\r\n   of the carpels. Shrubs or under-shrubs, more rarely herbs\r\n   with fleshy stems and simple, entire, more frequently thick\r\n   or triangular leaves, containing a quantity of water. The\r\n   flowers open about noon, and are brightly coloured, generally\r\n   red or red-violet, but odourless. The capsules dehisce in\r\n   rainy weather. 300 species, mostly found at the Cape. Some are\r\n   ornamental plants. _M. crystallinum_ (the Ice-plant) and others\r\n   are covered with peculiar, bladder-like, sparkling hairs, the\r\n   cell-sap of which contains salt--these serve as reservoirs of\r\n   water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 8. =Cactifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe position of this family is very doubtful; but it seems in many\r\nrespects to approach _Mesembrianthemum_. Some botanists place it near\r\nto the Ribesiaceæ; others, again, to the Passifloraceæ. Only 1 order.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 368.--_A Echinocactus_: _a_ position of a\r\n  leaf-lamina; _b_ a lateral shoot on the displaced axillary bud.\r\n  _B_ Pereskia: _b_ a foliage-leaf on a small thorny branch which\r\n  is subtended by a foliage-leaf which has fallen off and left a\r\n  scar(_a_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 369.--_Echinopsis._]\r\n\r\nOrder =Cactaceæ= (=The Cacti=). The flower is epigynous, ☿, regular,\r\nand remarkable for its _acyclic_ structure; there are, for instance, a\r\nlarge number of spirally-placed sepals and petals, which gradually pass\r\nover into one another, and which in some species, to a certain extent,\r\narise from the walls of the ovary as in _Nymphæa_ (Fig. 383 _A_, _B_).\r\nThe petals are free; rotate, opening widely in _Opuntia_, _Pereskia_,\r\nand _Rhipsalis_; erect and united at their base into a shorter or\r\nlonger tube in _Cereus_, _Epiphyllum_, _Mammillaria_, _Echinocactus_,\r\n_Melocactus_, and others (Fig. 369). _Stamens numerous_, attached to\r\nthe base of the corolla; gynœceum formed of _many carpels_, with one\r\nstyle, dividing into a number of branches corresponding to the number\r\nof carpels; the ovary has _one loculus_ with _many parietal_ placentæ;\r\nthe ovules are anatropous, on long and curved funicles. Fruit a berry\r\nwith exendospermous seeds. The fruit-pulp is mainly derived from the\r\nfunicles.--The external appearance of the Cactaceæ is very peculiar;\r\n_Pereskia_, which has thick and fleshy leaves (Fig. 368), deviates\r\nthe least; foliage-leaves of the usual form are wanting in the other\r\ngenera, or are usually very small, and quickly fall off and disappear\r\n(_Opuntia_), or are modified into thorns; the stem, without normal\r\nfoliage-leaves,--so characteristic a feature in this order,--makes its\r\nappearance after the two normally developed cotyledons. The stems\r\nare fleshy, perennial, and may finally become woody. In some they are\r\nelongated, globose, pointed, and more or less dichotomously branched,\r\n_e.g._ in several of the _Rhipsalis_ species, which live mostly as\r\nepiphytes on trees; in others, elongated, branched, globose, or, most\r\nfrequently, more or less angular (prismatic) or grooved and provided\r\nwith wings, and either columnar and erect (as much as about 20 metres\r\nin height and 1 metre in circumference, as in _C. giganteus_ in New\r\nMexico) or climbing by roots (_Cereus_ and _Rhipsalis_-species);\r\nin others again, compressed, more or less leaf-like, often with a\r\nridge in the centre (winged), branched and jointed: _Epiphyllum_,\r\n_Phyllocactus_, _Opuntia_, some species of _Rhipsalis_; others are\r\nthick, short, spherical or ovoid, unbranched or only slightly branched,\r\nand either studded with prominent warts (_mammillæ_) each of which\r\nsupports a tuft of thorns (Fig. 368 _A_; _Mammillaria_ and others) or\r\nwith vertical ridges, separated by furrows (rows of mammillæ which\r\nhave coalesced) in _Melocactus_, _Echinocactus_, _Echinopsis_ (Fig.\r\n369); at the same time the ovary in some is embedded in the stem so\r\nthat leaves or leaf-scars, with tufts of thorns in their axils, may be\r\nobserved on the ovary just as on the stem.--The flattened shoots of\r\nthe Cactaceæ are formed in various ways, either by the compression of\r\ncylindrical axes (_Opuntia_) or, as in _Melocactus_, etc., from winged\r\nstems in which all the wings are suppressed except two.\r\n\r\n   The thorns are produced directly from the growing points of\r\n   the axillary buds, and are modified leaves. The axillary bud\r\n   is united at its base with its subtending leaf, which as a\r\n   rule is extremely rudimentary; and these together form a kind\r\n   of leaf-cushion, larger in some genera than in others. This\r\n   leaf-cushion attains its highest development in _Mammillaria_,\r\n   in which it is a large, conical wart (see Fig. 368 _A_), bearing\r\n   on its apex the tuft of thorns and rudimentary lamina.--The\r\n   _seedlings_ have normal cotyledons and a fleshy hypocotyl.\r\n\r\n   All the species (1,000?) are American (one epiphytic species of\r\n   _Rhipsalis_ is indigenous in S. Africa, Mauritius and Ceylon),\r\n   especially from the tropical table-lands (Mexico, etc.). Some\r\n   species, especially those without thorns, as _Rhipsalis_, are\r\n   epiphytes. _Opuntia vulgaris_, the fruits of which are edible,\r\n   is naturalized in the Mediterranean. The cochineal insect\r\n   (_Coccus cacti_) lives on this and some closely allied species\r\n   (_O. coccinellifera_, etc.), particularly in Mexico and the\r\n   Canary Islands. Several are ornamental plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 9. =Polycarpicæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers _as a rule are_ ☿, _regular_ and _hypogynous_; however\r\nin some orders they are unisexual, _e.g._ in the Myristicaceæ, or\r\nzygomorphic (in Monkshood and Larkspur in the Ranunculaceæ); in the\r\nLauraceæ, (Fig. 386) for example, perigynous, and in _Nymphæa_ (Fig.\r\n383) even partially epigynous flowers are typical.--The flowers are\r\nacyclic in very many of the genera of the two first orders, if not\r\ncompletely so, at any rate in the numerous stamens and carpels, thus\r\ndenoting an old type. It is a remarkable characteristic that in the\r\nmajority of the orders the number 3 prevails in the calyx and corolla;\r\nthe number 5 also occurs, but the number 2 is seldom met with. Most\r\norders have a double perianth; chorisis does not occur, suppression\r\nis rare, and the parts of the flower are developed in acropetal\r\nsuccession. The most characteristic feature in the order is the _free,\r\none-leaved_, as a rule _numerous carpels_ (apocarpous gynœceum). The\r\nnumber of carpels in some of the last mentioned orders dwindles down\r\nto 1 (_e.g._ the _Berberideæ_ and _Myristicaceæ_). The carpels in\r\n_Nymphæaceæ_ become united into _one pistil_ (syncarpous), a condition\r\nwhich we also find distributed among the other orders.\r\n\r\n_Endosperm occurs in almost all_ the orders (except _e.g. Lauraceæ_).\r\nThe nutritive tissue in _Cabombeæ_ and _Nymphæeæ_ is chiefly\r\n_perisperm_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 370.--Diagram of _Aquilegia vulgaris_: _sp_\r\n  spur. A cyclic flower.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 371.--Diagram of a dichasium of _Ranunculus\r\n  acer_: α_{1}, α^1, and β_{1}, β^1, bracteoles (the buds\r\n  in the axils of the bracteoles, α and α^1, are continued\r\n  antidromously). The flower has cyclic calyx and corolla, bub\r\n  acyclic (8/21) stamens.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 372.--Diagram of an acyclic Ranunculaceous\r\n  flower (only 3 stamens are indicated). The spiral of the sepals\r\n  has a divergence of 3/5; that of the corolla and subsequent\r\n  leaves 3/8.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Ranunculaceæ.= Nearly all are _herbs_ (except _Clematis_).\r\nThe leaves are scattered (except _Clematideæ_), they have a large\r\nsheath with broad base (no stipules), and are most frequently\r\npalminerved with palmate lobes. The flowers are hypogynous, with most\r\nfrequently a well pronounced convex receptacle (Figs. 374 _B_, 380), ☿,\r\nregular (except _Delphinium_ and _Aconitum_); their structure varies\r\nvery much; in some the leaves are verticillate, in others arranged\r\nspirally; in others, again, both modes of arrangement are found. It is\r\na characteristic feature that the various series of leaves (especially\r\ncalyx and corolla) are not so distinct or so sharply divided as\r\nis usual. The leaves of the perianth are free, imbricate (except\r\n_Clematideæ_); stamens _numerous_, with most frequently extrorse\r\nanthers; gynœceum _free_, _apocarpous_ (except _Nigella_ and partly\r\n_Helleborus_), with 1 or several ovules (Figs. 373, 378, 379) borne on\r\nthe ventral suture. The fruit is either a nut or a follicle (_Actæa_\r\nhas berries). The seed has a _large, oil-containing_ endosperm and a\r\nsmall embryo (Fig. 374).\r\n\r\n   The main axis generally terminates in a flower, and the\r\n   lateral axes branch in a cymose manner (Fig. 371). The flowers\r\n   show the following differences in construction: VERTICILLATE\r\n   (EUCYCLIC), _i.e._ constructed all through of alternating\r\n   whorls: _Aquilegia_ (Fig. 370), _Xanthorhiza_, and sometimes\r\n   _Eranthis_. SEMIVERTICILLATE (HEMICYCLIC) _i.e._ with sepals and\r\n   petals in alternate whorls, and the others arranged spirally:\r\n   _Ranunculus_ (Fig. 371), _Myosurus_, _Pæonia_ and several other\r\n   genera entirely, or in certain species only. SPIRAL-FLOWERED\r\n   (ACYCLIC) _i.e._ all the leaves are arranged spirally, so\r\n   that sepals and petals do not alternate the one with the\r\n   other, even though they are the same in number: _Adonis_ (Fig.\r\n   372), _Aconitum_, _Delphinium_-species, _Nigella_-species,\r\n   _Helleborus_. The leaves of the calyx are in this instance\r\n   arranged on a spiral of 2/5; those of the corolla on 2/5,\r\n   3/8, 5/13 or 8/21, and stamens and carpels likewise on higher\r\n   fractions of the same series.\r\n\r\n   The genera _Caltha_, _Anemone_, _Thalictrum_ and _Clematis_\r\n   have a _single perianth_, which is most frequently petaloid;\r\n   it is thus apparent that the sepals are petaloid, and the\r\n   leaves, which in other genera have developed as petals, are in\r\n   these instances stamens. The calyx is similarly petaloid in\r\n   the genera _Helleborus_, _Eranthis_, _Nigella_, _Delphinium_\r\n   and _Aconitum_; but the petals are present in these instances\r\n   in unusual (horn-like) forms, and almost entirely given\r\n   up to the function of nectaries, a function they already\r\n   possess in _Ranunculus_. According to a more recent theory\r\n   the “honey-leaves” are transformed stamens, which have lost\r\n   the function of reproduction; the perianth is then single,\r\n   and most frequently petaloid. [Those leaves in the flowers of\r\n   many Ranunculaceæ which bear nectaries are termed by Prantl\r\n   honey-leaves, and comprise those leaf-structures of the flower\r\n   whose essential function lies in the production of nectar,\r\n   and which, independent of the differentiation of the perianth\r\n   into calyx and corolla, are derived from the stamens by the\r\n   loss of their reproductive functions. Clear transitional\r\n   forms are found between the two series of the perianth\r\n   (_e.g._ between the sepaloid and petaloid perianth-leaves\r\n   of _Anemone japonica_, _A. decapetala_, _Trollius_-species)\r\n   while transitional forms are never found between perianth-and\r\n   honey-leaves (with the exception of _Aquilegia vulgaris_, var.\r\n   _stellata_). In _Anemone_ and _Clematis_ the honey-leaves\r\n   pass gradually into the stamens, and agree with the stamens\r\n   in the other Ranunculaceæ in their arrangement, development,\r\n   and scant system of veins (except _Nigella_). In _Delphinium_,\r\n   sect. _Consolida_, the two honey-leaves placed in front of\r\n   the unpaired perianth-leaf are united into one, as shown by\r\n   the veins (twice three veins arranged symmetrically). The\r\n   honey-leaves of _Aquilegia_, _Callianthemum_, and the majority\r\n   of the _Ranunculus_-species serve by reason of their large\r\n   circumference, as organs of attraction, and on this account\r\n   are considered as petals by other authors.--The same position\r\n   in the flower which the honey-leaves assume is found occupied\r\n   by staminodes, without nectar, in some _Coptis_-species, in\r\n   _Anemonopsis_, _Actæa_ sect. _Euactæa_, (_e.g. A. racemosa_),\r\n   _Clematis_ sect. _Atragene_; in the last-named they closely\r\n   surround the stamens, in _Actæa_ they are petaloid.--A perianth,\r\n   sharply differentiated into calyx and corolla, and destitute of\r\n   honey-leaves, is found in _Anemone_, sect. _Knowltonia_ (Cape),\r\n\r\n   _Adonis_, _Pæonia_.--The perianth of the Ranunculaceæ is\r\n   considered by Prantl to be usually petaloid.--The nectaries\r\n   arise in the Ranunculaceæ (1) on normal stamens (_Clematis_\r\n   sect. _Viorna_), (2) on the honey-leaves (this is generally the\r\n   case), and (3) on the carpels (_Caltha_ and the majority of\r\n   _Trollius_-species).--As the result of his researches upon the\r\n   Ranunculaceæ, Prantl does not agree with the view advanced by\r\n   Drude (Schenk, _Hand. d. Bot._ iii.) that the petals in general\r\n   have proceeded from the metamorphosis of the stamens (_K_)].\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 373.--Ovaries in longitudinal section: _v_\r\n  the ventral suture; _d_ the dorsal suture: _A_, _B Clematis_;\r\n  _C Ranunculus_; _D Myosurus_.]\r\n\r\n   The most primitive form of fruit is undoubtedly the pod formed\r\n   by one carpel, on the edges of which (along the ventral suture)\r\n   two rows of ovules are situated: Pæonieæ, Helleboreæ, Delphinieæ\r\n   (Fig. 379). In a great many genera the number of ovules has been\r\n   limited to _one_ perfect one, which is placed in the central\r\n   plane under the united leaf-edges, and sometimes also some\r\n   barren ovules above it (Fig. 373). The fruitlets in this case\r\n   become achenes, and are present in much larger numbers than when\r\n   there are follicles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 374.--_Helleborus niger_: _A_ flower; _B_\r\n  receptacle; _pet_ petals (honey-leaves); _pi_ stamens and\r\n  carpels; _C_ seed; _D_ anther (cross section); _alb_ endosperm.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 375.--_Caltha palustris_: fruit.]\r\n\r\nThe following have FOLLICLES: _Pæonieæ_, _Helleboreæ_ (except _Actæa_)\r\nand _Delphinieæ_; ACHENES: _Ranunculeæ_, _Anemoneæ_ and _Clematideæ_.\r\n\r\n=A.

This has regular, acyclic flowers with a\r\nnormal, most frequently 5-leaved, imbricate calyx; large, coloured\r\npetals, and introrse anthers. Slightly perigynous. Surrounding the\r\nbase of the carpels a ring-like swelling of the receptacle (“disc”) is\r\npresent, which is largest in _P. moutan_. The follicles are more or\r\nless fleshy or leathery. Mostly herbs, with pinnatisect or decompound\r\nleaves and large, solitary flowers; a gradual transition may be traced\r\nfrom the foliage-leaves to the petals. _Pæonia; Hydrastis._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 376.--_Aquilegia vulgaris._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 377.--_Caltha palustris_ (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 378.--_Nigella_: _A_, _B_ fruit of _N.\r\n  damascena_, entire, and cut transversely. _C_ Petal (honey-leaf)\r\n  of _N. arvensis_. _D_ Petal of _N. damascena_.]\r\n\r\n=2.= HELLEBOREÆ, HELLEBORE GROUP. This has regular flowers with most\r\nfrequently a coloured calyx. The petals (honey-leaves) are modified\r\ninto nectaries; they may be horn-like, provided with a spur, or of a\r\nsimilarly unusual form, or they may be entirely absent. Anthers often\r\nextrorse.--_Trollius_ (Globe-flower[36]). The flower is acyclic: many\r\npetaloid sepals, succeeding these, most frequently, several _linear_,\r\ndark yellow petals, which bear a naked nectary at the base; finally,\r\nmany stamens and carpels arranged in a spiral (3/8, 8/21).--_Caltha_\r\n(Marsh-marigold, Figs. 375, 377); 5 (-7) yellow sepals, no petals.\r\nThe foliage-leaves have a large amplexicaul sheath.--_Helleborous_\r\n(Hellebore) has pedate leaves. The flower is acyclic, with 5 large,\r\nregular, _persistent_, often petaloid sepals (2/5); small, _horn-like_\r\npetals (honey-leaves; most frequently 13, divergence 8/13) and\r\ngenerally few carpels (Fig. 374).--_Coptis._--_Isopyrum._--_Eranthis_\r\n(Winter Aconite), like _Anemone_, has a 3-leaved involucre and most\r\nfrequently trimerous flowers, ~6 large petaloid sepals, 6 petals\r\n(tubular honey-leaves), 6 oblique rows of stamens, 3–6 carpels~.\r\n_Aquilegia_ (Columbine, Fig. 376); the flower is entirely cyclic and\r\nhas large spurs on all the 5 petals (funnel-shaped honey-leaves); S5\r\ncoloured, P5, A5 × (8–12), G5 in regular alternation (Figs. 376, 370);\r\nthe innermost stamens are often staminodes (Fig. 370).--_Nigella_\r\n(Love-in-the-mist, Fig. 378) has 5 sepals and 8 small, _two-lipped_\r\npetals cleft at the apex (the nectary is covered by the under-lip;\r\nFig. 378 _C_, _D_). The 5 carpels are more or less completely united;\r\nand a many-carpellate ovary with free styles is formed in some.

Fruit achenes.\r\n\r\n=4.= RANUNCULEÆ, BUTTERCUP GROUP, has double perianth. _Myosurus_\r\nand _Adonis_ have pendulous ovules as in Anemoneæ (Fig. 373 _D_);\r\n~_Ranunculus_, with _Batrachium_ and _Ficaria_, erect ovules (Fig. 373\r\n_C_) and downwardly-turned radicle.~--_Ranunculus._ Most frequently\r\nS5, P5, many spirally-placed stamens and carpels (Figs. 371, 380). The\r\npetals (honey-leaves) have a nectary at the base, covered by a small\r\nscale. ~_Batrachium_, Water Ranunculus, deviates by the achenes being\r\ntransversely wrinkled; dimorphic leaves. _Ficaria_ has 3 sepals and 7–8\r\npetals arranged in 2/5–3/8. _F. ranunculoides_ (the only species) has\r\ntuberous roots, which spring from the base of the axillary buds, and\r\ntogether with these, serve as organs of reproduction. The embryo has\r\nonly 1 cotyledon.~--_Myosurus_ (Mouse-tail) has small prolongations\r\nfrom the 5 sepals; 5 narrow petals which bear the nectaries near the\r\napex; sometimes only 5 stamens, and an ultimately very long receptacle,\r\nwith numerous spirally-arranged achenes (Fig. 381).--_Adonis_ is\r\nacyclic (Fig. 372); most frequently 5 sepals with a divergence of 2/5,\r\n8 petals of 3/8, indefinite stamens and carpels of 3/8 or 5/13. The\r\ncorolla has no nectary.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 380.--Flower of _Ranunculus sceleratus_ in\r\n  longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 381.--_Myosurus minimus_: _c_ cotyledons; _m_\r\n  the foliage-leaves; _f_ the floral axis with the carpels, and _g_\r\n  the same without; _y_ insertion of perianth.]\r\n\r\n=5.= ANEMONEÆ, ANEMONE GROUP, has a single perianth. ~(Pendulous ovules\r\n(Fig. 373 _D_), radicle turned upward).~--_Anemone_ has a single,\r\npetaloid, most frequently 5–6-leaved perianth, and beneath the flower\r\nmost frequently _an involucre of 3 leaves_, placed close together in\r\nthe form of a whorl. In _A. nemorosa_, _ranunculoides_, etc., the\r\ninvolucral leaves resemble foliage-leaves; in _A. hepatica_ they are\r\nsituated close under the perianth, and resemble sepals, and in the\r\nsub-genus _Pulsatilla_ they stand between the foliage-leaves and\r\nfloral-leaves. The style of _Pulsatilla_ finally grows out in the form\r\nof a feather. ~The main axis of _A. hepatica_ has unlimited growth (it\r\nis biaxial), and the flowers are borne laterally in the axils of the\r\nscale-leaves; in the others (uniaxial) the flower is terminal, and the\r\nrhizome becomes a sympodium after the first flowering.~--_Thalictrum_\r\n(Meadow Rue) has no involucre; 4–5-leaved, greenish perianth. The\r\nreceptacle is flat. ~The stamens are brightly-coloured and have long\r\nfilaments; 1–5 accessory flowers may occur in the leaf-axils of the\r\npanicle-like inflorescence.~\r\n\r\n=6.= CLEMATIDEÆ, CLEMATIS GROUP. This differs from all the others\r\nin the _valvate æstivation_ of the calyx and its opposite leaves.\r\nThere are 4 (-several) petaloid sepals; petals are absent, or linear\r\n(_Atragene_). Ovule 1, pendulous. Achenes, often with prolonged,\r\nfeathery style. The majority of the genera are shrubs, and climb by\r\ntheir sensitive, twining leaf-stalks.--_Clematis; Atragene._\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. The flowers are conspicuous either by coloured\r\n   petals (honey-leaves) (_Ranunculus_, _Pæonia_) or coloured\r\n   sepals (_Helleborus_, _Anemone_, _Caltha_, etc.), or by both\r\n   (_Aquilegia_, _Delphinium_), or by the coloured stamens\r\n   (_Thalictrum_). Some have no honey (_Clematis_, _Anemone_,\r\n   _Thalictrum_), and are generally visited by insects for\r\n   the sake of their pollen. Others have nectaries on the\r\n   corolla (_Ranunculus_, _Trollius_, _Helleborus_, _Nigella_,\r\n   _Aconitum_, etc.), more rarely on the stamens (_Pulsatilla_,\r\n   _Clematis_-species), or the carpels (_Caltha_), or the calyx\r\n   (certain species of _Pæonia_). The honey is readily accessible\r\n   in the flat, open flowers, and these flowers also may easily\r\n   pollinate themselves. There is marked protandry where the\r\n   honey lies deeply hidden, as in _Aquilegia_, _Delphinium_, and\r\n   _Aconitum_. _Helleborus_ and some _Ranunculus_-species are\r\n   protogynous.\r\n\r\n   About 680 species; especially in northern temperate climates,\r\n   and extending to the Polar and Alpine regions. Only the\r\n   _Clematideæ_ are tropical.\r\n\r\n   The order has an abundance of _acrid_, vesicant properties\r\n   (_R. acer_, _sceleratus_, etc.), and _poisonous_ alkaloids\r\n   (_Helleborus niger_ is poisonous). OFFICINAL: _Aconitum\r\n   napellus_ (aconitine; leaves and tuberous roots); the rhizome of\r\n   _Hydrastis canadensis_ from N. Am. (the alkaloid hydrastine).\r\n   The order, however, is best known for its ornamental plants;\r\n   almost all the genera have species which are cultivated for\r\n   their beauty. Sweet-scented flowers are absent.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Nymphæaceæ (Water Lilies).= WATER PLANTS; generally with\r\nlarge, floating leaves, and large solitary flowers; sepals 3–5, petals\r\n3–∞, stamens 6–∞, carpels 3–∞. The flower is hypogynous, but in the\r\n_Nymphæeæ_ different degrees of epigyny are found, and from this fact,\r\nas well as from the carpels being united into one pistil, the family\r\nforms a lateral offshoot from the Ranunculaceæ, with much greater\r\nmodification. The seed often has an aril, and, in the majority, a\r\nfarinaceous nutritive tissue, partly endosperm, partly perisperm (Fig.\r\n383 _C_). The embryo has 2 thick cotyledons and a small hypocotyl; the\r\nplumule is well developed, with 2–4 leaves.\r\n\r\n   1. CABOMBEÆ. 3–4 species (Tropical S. Am.), resembling the\r\n   Water Ranunculus, with two kinds of leaves, the submerged being\r\n   dissected and the aerial peltate. The flowers are eucyclic,\r\n   trimerous, with 2–3 free, epigynous carpels. The ovules are\r\n   situated _on the central line_ of the carpel--an almost unique\r\n   circumstance. Endosperm and perisperm. _Cabomba; Brasenia._\r\n\r\n2. NELUMBONEÆ. The leaves are _peltate_, raised on long stalks high\r\nabove the water. Large, _hypogynous_ flowers (Fig. 382); sepals 4–5;\r\npetals numerous; stamens numerous; _carpels several_, _distinct_. The\r\nreceptacle is very remarkable, being raised above the stamens, and\r\ndeveloped into an _inverted conical_ body on the apex of which the\r\nnut-like fruits are _embedded in pits_. _Endosperm is wanting_, but\r\nthe embryo is large and has well developed cotyledons.--~_Nelumbo_,\r\n2 species. _N. lutea_ (N. Am.); _N. speciosa_ (E. Ind.) was sacred\r\namongst the ancient Hindoos and Egyptians, (the Lotus flower); its\r\nseeds are used as food.~\r\n\r\n3. NYMPHÆEÆ, WATER LILY GROUP. The carpels are united into _one_,\r\n_many-locular ovary_, _whose numerous ovules are situated on the\r\nsurface of the partition walls_ (as in the Poppies); the stigma is\r\nsessile and radiating, the number of rays corresponding to the number\r\nof carpels (Fig. 383). The fruit is a spongy _berry_ with many seeds,\r\nwhich have a large perisperm in addition to the endosperm (Fig. 383\r\n_C_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 382.--_Nelumbo nucifera_: vertical section\r\n  through the receptacle.]\r\n\r\nSepals, petals, and stamens often pass gradually over the one into the\r\nother, the petals becoming narrower by degrees, and bearing anthers\r\non each side of the apex, which gradually become larger anthers in\r\nproportion to the filament, until the perfect stamen is developed.\r\nThe long-stalked leaves are floating, and most frequently cordate,\r\nelliptical, leathery, with a shiny surface, sometimes (as in _Victoria\r\nregia_ and _Euryale ferox_) with strongly projecting thorny ribs on the\r\nlower surface. In the intercellular passages of the leaves are some\r\npeculiar, stellate cells.\r\n\r\n_Nuphar_ has 5 sepals, and an _hypogynous_ flower. ~The petals, which\r\nare small, have a nectary on the back; the coloured inner side of the\r\nsepals functions as petals; the ovate gynœceum is quite free.--_N.\r\nluteum_ is a native plant (Yellow Water-Lily), with, most frequently,\r\n13 petals and 10–16 loculi in the ovary. The rhizome is horizontal, as\r\nmuch as 5–6 cm. in thickness, and bears on its under surface a number\r\nof roots, which on dying-off leave deep scars; the leaves are borne in\r\nspiral lines, and the flowers are solitary in certain leaf-axils. The\r\nconstruction of the rhizome is very peculiar; the vascular bundles are\r\nscattered and closed as in a monocotyledonous stem.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 383.--_Nymphæa_: _A_ flower in longitudinal\r\n  section, the most external leaves being removed; _B_ fruit; _C_\r\n  seed of _Nuphar_ (longitudinal section); the perisperm at the\r\n  base, the endosperm at the top surrounding the embryo.]\r\n\r\n_Nymphæa_ has 4 sepals, and the flower is more or less _epigynous_.\r\nPetals and stamens are inserted at different heights on the ovary to\r\njust beneath the stigma (Fig. 383). _Nymphæa alba_ (White Water-Lily).\r\n_Victoria regia_ from the Amazon, and _Euryale ferox_ from Asia, have\r\nentirely epigynous flowers. ~The shield-like leaves of _Victoria_ are\r\nas much as 2 metres in diameter, and the edge is bent up to a height\r\nof 5–14 cm.; the flowers are 20–40 cm. in diameter, and change in\r\ntwenty-four hours from white to rose-red. A development of heat, as\r\nmuch as 14°C. above the temperature of the air, together with a strong\r\nformation of carbonic acid, has been observed during flowering.~\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. _Nymphæa alba_ and other species of the\r\n   sub-genus _Symphytopleura_ are self-pollinated; the sub-genus\r\n   _Leptopleura_ is insect-pollinated. _Nuphar_ and _Victoria_ can\r\n   effect self-fertilisation; _Euryale_ is self-fertilised, often\r\n   in entirely closed and submerged flowers.--The dissemination\r\n   of the seeds in _Nuphar luteum_ is effected by the fruit,\r\n   which rests on the water, becoming detached from its stalk,\r\n   and dehiscing from the base upwards so that the seeds are\r\n   set free; while in _Nymphæa alba_ the spirally-twisted stalk\r\n   draws the fruit under water, and it dehisces by its upper part\r\n   being thrown off as a hood, and the seeds which are enclosed\r\n   in air-tight sacs rise to the surface of the water. In this\r\n   condition they are able to float and can only sink to the bottom\r\n   when the air has disappeared.\r\n\r\n   53 species; in fresh water in all parts of the world, but\r\n   especially in the Tropics.--The rhizomes and seeds of some may\r\n   be used as food; _Euryale ferox_ is even cultivated. _Nymphæa\r\n   cœrulea_ and _Lotus_ were sacred among the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Ceratophyllaceæ.= About 3 species. Aquatic plants, submerged,\r\nrootless; leaves cartilaginous, verticillate, dissected into repeatedly\r\ndichotomous branches which are finely toothed; only one of the leaves\r\nin a whorl supports a vegetative branch. The flowers are _monœcious_,\r\naxillary. Inside the 6–12 perianth-leaves are situated in the ♂-flower\r\n10–20 stamens with thick connective, and in the ♀-flower a gynœceum\r\nformed by one carpel, with one orthotropous and pendulous ovule, which\r\nhas only one integument. Fruit a nut, which, in some species, bears on\r\neach side a pointed horn, and at the apex a similar one, formed by the\r\npersistent style.--The embryo has an unusually well developed plumule\r\nwith several whorls of leaves. The plant is rootless throughout its\r\nwhole life.--_Ceratophyllum_ (Horn-wort).\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Annonaceæ.= Sepals 3; petals 3+3 (most frequently\r\n   _valvate_); succeeding these (as in the _Ranunculaceæ_) are\r\n   _numerous acyclic_ stamens and an _apocarpous gynœceum_; the\r\n   flowers are hypogynous, regular and ☿, generally very large\r\n   (2–3 cm. in diameter), and the leaves of the perianth are\r\n   more or less fleshy or leathery. The majority have syncarps\r\n   with berry-like fruitlets, but in _Annona_ and some others\r\n   the carpels fuse together into a large, head-like fruit--a\r\n   kind of composite berry. The seeds have _ruminate_ endosperm\r\n   as in _Myristica_.--Trees or shrubs with _alternate_, simple,\r\n   entire, penninerved leaves without stipules. 450 (700?) species;\r\n   especially tropical. The best known are _Anona cherimolia_,\r\n   _squamosa_ and _reticulata_ (all from America) cultivated on\r\n   account of their large, delicious fruits. Some have acrid and\r\n   aromatic properties (_Xylopia_, _Cananga_--the flowers of the\r\n   latter yield Ylang-ylang); _Artabotrys odoratissimus_; _Asimina_\r\n   (N. Am.).\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Magnoliaceæ.= Trees or shrubs with scattered, often\r\n   leathery, entire leaves, generally with _stipules_, which (as in\r\n   _Ficus_) are rolled together and form a hood round the younger\r\n   internodes above them, and are cast off by the unfolding of\r\n   the next leaf, leaving a ring-like scar. The endosperm is _not\r\n   ruminate_. Corolla imbricate. Fruit a syncarp.\r\n\r\n   =A.= MAGNOLIEÆ. The flowers are borne singly, and before opening\r\n   are enveloped in an ochrea-like spathe which corresponds to\r\n   the stipules of the foliage-leaves. The perianth generally\r\n   consists of 3 trimerous whorls, the external one of which\r\n   is sometimes sepaloid (_Liriodendron_, and the majority of\r\n   _Magnolia_species), sometimes coloured like the others; the\r\n   perianth is sometimes many-seriate. _Numerous spirally-placed_\r\n   stamens and carpels. The latter are situated on the _elongated_,\r\n   cylindrical receptacle, and are individually more or less\r\n   united, except in _Liriodendron_, where they are free. This last\r\n   genus has winged achenes; the fruitlets in _Magnolia_ open along\r\n   the dorsal and ventral sutures, and the seeds then hang out,\r\n   suspended by elastic threads formed from the vascular bundles\r\n   of the funicle and raphe; they are red and drupaceous, the\r\n   external layer of the shell being fleshy--a very rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n   =B.= ILLICIEÆ has no stipules. The carpels are situated in a\r\n   whorl on a short receptacle. Follicles, one-seeded. The leaves\r\n   are dotted by glands containing essential oil. _Illicium;\r\n   Drimys._\r\n\r\n   70 species; in tropical or temperate climates; none in Europe\r\n   or Africa. They are chiefly used as ornamental plants, _e.g._\r\n   the Tulip-tree (_Liriodendron tulipifera_, N. Am.), _Magnolia\r\n   grandiflora_ (N. Am.), _M. yulan_ and _fuscata_ (China), and\r\n   others. The remains of _Liriodendron_ occur as fossils in the\r\n   Cretaceous and Tertiary periods.--The fruits of _Illicium\r\n   anisatum_ (Star-aniseed from Eastern Asia) are OFFICINAL. The\r\n   bark of _Drimys winteri_ (S. Am.) is also strongly aromatic.\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Calycanthaceæ.= These are very closely related to\r\n   the Magnoliaceæ, but differ in having _perigynous_ flowers\r\n   with many perianth-leaves, stamens and (about 20) carpels in a\r\n   continuous _spiral_, seeds _almost devoid of endosperm_ with\r\n   rolled up, leaf-like cotyledons, and leaves opposite on a square\r\n   stem.--There are some species in N. America (_Calycanthus\r\n   florida_, _occidentalis_, etc.) and 1 in Japan (_Chimonanthus\r\n   præcox_), all strongly aromatic.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Monimiaceæ.= Aromatic shrubs with opposite leaves.\r\n   Perigynous flowers. The anthers dehisce by valves like those of\r\n   the _Lauraceæ_, and the Monimiaceæ may thus be considered as an\r\n   apocarpous form of this order. They are also closely related to\r\n   _Calycanthaceæ_. 150 species, tropical.--_Hedycarya, Mollinedia,\r\n   Monimia._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 384.--Diagram of _Berberis_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 385.--_Berberis_: carpel with 2 stamens.]\r\n\r\nOrder 8. =Berberidaceæ (Barberries).=--The regular, ☿, hypogynous\r\nflowers are dimerous or trimerous and have regularly alternating\r\nwhorls of free sepals, petals, and stamens and 1 unilocular carpel;\r\nthe corolla and stamens have each 2 whorls, the calyx at least 2. The\r\nanthers open, as in Lauraceæ, by (2) _valves_, but are always introrse\r\n(Fig. 384). The pistil has a large, disc-like, almost _sessile_ stigma\r\n(Fig. 385), and in the ovary _several_ erect ovules are placed close to\r\nthe base of the ventral suture. The fruit is most frequently a _berry_.\r\nSeeds endospermous.--Shrubs or herbs with scattered, most frequently\r\ncompound leaves (without stipules), and racemose inflorescences.--~They\r\nshow a relationship to the Lauraceæ in the number of the parts of the\r\nflower and the dehiscence of the anthers.~\r\n\r\n_Berberis_ is a shrub; it has sepals 3 + 3, petals 3 + 3, stamens 3\r\n+ 3 (Fig. 384). The petals (honey-leaves) bear internally at the base\r\n2 darkish-yellow nectaries. The filaments are sensitive at the base,\r\nand suddenly bend inwards if touched at that spot (Fig. 385). ~The\r\nracemes often have a terminal, 5-merous flower; they are borne on\r\ndwarf-branches. The leaves on the long-branches develope into thorns,\r\nbut the buds in their axils, in the same year as themselves, develope\r\nas the short-branches with simple foliage-leaves, _articulated_ at\r\nthe base, from which fact some authorities have considered that the\r\nleaf is compound with a single, terminal leaflet.~--_Mahonia_ has\r\nimparipinnate leaves. The flower has 3 whorls of sepals. Otherwise as\r\nin _Berberis_.--~_Epimedium_; herbs with spurred petals; the flowers\r\ndimerous; 4–5 whorls of sepals, 2 of petals and stamens. Fruit a\r\ncapsule. _Leontice_, fruit dry. The anthers of _Podophyllum_ dehisce\r\nlongitudinally.--_Nandina. Aceranthus._~\r\n\r\n   100 species; North temp., especially Asia: fossils in Tertiary.\r\n   _Berberis vulgaris_ is a native of Europe. This and other\r\n   species, together with _Mahonia aquifolium_ (N. Am.), _Epimedium\r\n   alpinum_, etc., are cultivated as ornamental plants. Several\r\n   have a yellow colouring matter in the root and stem. OFFICINAL:\r\n   the rhizome of _Podophyllum peltatum_ (from N. Am.) yields\r\n   podophyllin.\r\n\r\n   Order 9. =Menispermaceæ.= This order has derived its name from\r\n   the more or less crescent-like fruits and seeds. Diœcious.\r\n   The flowers are 2–3-merous, most frequently as in _Berberis_\r\n   (S3 + 3, P3 + 3, A3 + 3), with the difference that there are\r\n   3 _free carpels_, each with 1 ovule; in some genera, however,\r\n   the number is different. Stamens often united into a bundle\r\n   (as in _Myristica_); anthers dehiscing longitudinally; fruit a\r\n   drupe.--The plants (with herbaceous or woody stems) belonging\r\n   to this order are nearly all _twining_ or _climbing_ plants,\r\n   and have scattered, palmate or peltate, sometimes lobed leaves\r\n   without stipules. Structure of stem anomalous. _Cocculus,\r\n   Menispermum, Cissampelos, Anamirta._\r\n\r\n   150 species; Tropical; very rich in bitter and poisonous\r\n   properties. OFFICINAL: Calumba-root from _Jateorhiza columba_\r\n   (E. Africa). The following are cultivated as ornamental\r\n   plants:--_Menispermum canadense_ (N. Am.) and _M. dahuricum_\r\n   (Asia). The fruits of _Anamirta cocculus_ (E. Ind.) are very\r\n   poisonous (“Grains-of-Paradise”; the poisonous matter is\r\n   picrotoxine).\r\n\r\n   Order 10. =Lardizabalaceæ.= This order, by the free, apocarpous\r\n   carpels, belongs to a more primitive type, and by the united\r\n   stamens to a more developed one. _Akebia_; _Holbœllia_;\r\n   principally climbing or twining shrubs. About 7 species in S.E.\r\n   Asia and S. Am.\r\n\r\nOrder 11. =Lauraceæ= (=True Laurels=). Trees or shrubs; the leaves,\r\nalways without stipules, are simple, most frequently scattered,\r\nlanceolate or elliptical, entire, penninerved, finely reticulate\r\n(except _Cinnamomum_ with 3–5-veined leaf), leathery and evergreen\r\n(except, _e.g. Cinnamomum_); they are frequently studded with clear\r\nglands containing _volatile oil_. The flowers are borne in panicles\r\nand are small and of a greenish or whitish colour. They are _regular,\r\nperigynous_, with most frequently a bowl or cup-shaped receptacle\r\n(Fig. 386), usually ☿, and _trimerous_ (rarely dimerous) through all\r\n(most frequently 6–7) whorls; viz. most frequently, perianth 2 whorls,\r\nstamens 3–4 and carpels 1 (P3 + 3, A3 + 3 + 3 + 3, G3) in regular\r\nalternation (Fig. 387). Each of the 2 or 4 loculi of the anthers _open\r\nby an upwardly directed valve_ (Fig. 386); of the stamens, the 2\r\noutermost whorls are generally introrse, the others extrorse, or 1–3\r\nwhorls are developed as staminodes (Fig. 387 _g_). The gynœceum has\r\n1 loculus with 1 style and 1 pendulous ovule (Fig. 386), and may be\r\nconsidered as formed of 3 carpels. The fruit is a _berry_ (Fig. 388)\r\nor _drupe_, which often is surrounded at its base by the persistent\r\nreceptacle (as an acorn by its cupule), which becomes fleshy and\r\nsometimes coloured during the ripening of the fruit. The embryo has 2\r\nthick cotyledons, but _no endosperm_ (Fig. 388).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 386.--Flower of the Cinnamon-tree\r\n  (_Cinnamomum zeylanicum_) (longitudinal section).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 387.--Typical diagram of the Lauraceæ: _g_\r\n  staminodes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 388.--_Laurus nobilis_: longitudinal section\r\n  of fruit.]\r\n\r\n   The Lauraceæ present affinities with the Polygonaceæ, in\r\n   which there is found perigyny, as well as a similar number of\r\n   parts in the flower and a similar gynœceum, but with erect\r\n   and orthotropous ovule. From their general characters they\r\n   should be classed among the Polycarpicæ, but stand, however,\r\n   isolated by the _syncarpous_ gynœceum, if it is in reality\r\n   formed by 3 carpels and not by 1 only. _Hernandia_, which has\r\n   epigynous monœcious flowers, deviates most.--_Cassytha_ is\r\n   a _Cuscuta_-like, herbaceous, slightly green parasite with\r\n   twining, almost leafless stems. The flower however agrees with\r\n   the diagram in Fig. 387. Some Lauraceæ have curved veins or\r\n   palminerved and lobed leaves (often together with entire ones)\r\n   _e.g. Sassafras_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 389.--_Myristica_: fruit.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 390.--Seed with aril entire and in\r\n  longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n   There are 1000 species; especially in the forests of tropical\r\n   S. America and Asia, of which they form the principal part.\r\n   Only _Laurus nobilis_ is found in Europe, and there is little\r\n   doubt that its proper home is in Western Asia. They are\r\n   rare in Africa.--On account of _the volatile oil_ found in\r\n   all parts of the plant, they are used as _spices_, _e.g._\r\n   the false Cinnamon-tree (_Dicypellium caryophyllatum_, in\r\n   the Brazils). The OFFICINAL ones are--the Cinnamon-tree\r\n   (_Cinnamomum zeylanicum_ from Ceylon, E. India, Eastern Asia),\r\n   which is also cultivated; the Camphor-tree (_Cinnamomum\r\n   camphora_, Eastern Asia). The Laurel-tree (_Laurus nobilis_,\r\n   Mediterranean), the berries and leaves of which give laurel oil,\r\n   is medicinal.--Scented wood for furniture, etc., is obtained\r\n   from _Sassafras officinalis_ (from N. Am.). The wood from its\r\n   roots is officinal. Pichurim “beans” are the large cotyledons\r\n   of _Nectandra pichury_, whilst the famous “Greenheart” wood\r\n   of Demarara is the wood of _Nectandra rodiæi_. The pulp and\r\n   seeds contain a _fatty oil_. The pear-like fruit of _Persea\r\n   gratissima_ (Mexico, also cultivated) is very delicious.\r\n   _Lindera benzoin_ is a garden shrub; _Laurus nobilis_ likewise.\r\n\r\n   Order 12. =Myristicaceæ= (=Nutmegs=). In this order there is\r\n   only 1 genus, _Myristica_. Trees or shrubs. The leaves agree\r\n   closely with those of the Lauraceæ, with which this order has\r\n   many points in common. The majority of the species are aromatic,\r\n   having in their vegetative parts pellucid glands with volatile\r\n   oils. The flowers are regular, diœcious, trimerous, and have a\r\n   single gamophyllous (cupular or campanulate) 3-toothed, fleshy\r\n   perianth. In the ♂-flowers the anthers vary in number (3–15),\r\n   and they are extrorse and borne on a centrally-placed column;\r\n   in the ♀-flower the gynœceum is unilocular, unicarpellary, with\r\n   1 ovule. The FRUIT (Fig. 389) has the form of a pear; it is a\r\n   fleshy, yellow capsule, which opens along the ventral and dorsal\r\n   sutures, exposing the large seed. This seed has a large, red,\r\n   irregularly branched aril--the so-called “mace”; the “nutmeg,”\r\n   on the other hand, is the seed itself with the inner thin\r\n   portion of the testa, which has pushed its way irregularly into\r\n   the endosperm, and causes the marbled appearance of the cut seed\r\n   (Fig. 390); the external, dark brown, hard, and brittle part\r\n   of the seed-shell is however removed. Mace and nutmeg contain\r\n   volatile and fatty oils in abundance.--80 species. Tropical. The\r\n   majority are used on account of their aromatic seeds and aril,\r\n   the most important being _M. fragrans_ (_moschata_), from the\r\n   Moluccas. This is cultivated in special plantations, not only in\r\n   its native home, but in other tropical countries also. Nutmegs\r\n   were known as commodities in Europe in very ancient times\r\n   (_e.g._ by the Romans), but it was not until the year 1500 that\r\n   the tree itself was known. The seed is OFFICINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 10. =Rhœadinæ.=\r\n\r\nThe plants belonging to this family are almost exclusively herbaceous,\r\nwith scattered, exstipulate leaves. The flowers are eucyclic di- or\r\ntetramerous, with the calyx and corolla deciduous, _hypogynous_,\r\n☿, _regular_, the gynœceum with 2–several carpels (generally 2,\r\ntransversely placed) (Figs. 391, 392, 393, 397). The ovary is\r\n_unilocular with parietal placentæ_, but in _Cruciferæ_ and a few\r\nothers it becomes bilocular by the development of a _false_, membranous\r\nwall between the placentæ. The stigmas in the majority of cases\r\nare _commissural_, _i.e._ they stand above the placentæ, and not\r\nabove the dorsal line of the carpels. The fruit is nearly always a\r\n_capsule_, which opens by the middle portions of the carpels detaching\r\nthemselves as valves, bearing no seed, whilst the placentæ persist\r\nas the seed-bearing frame. Endosperm is found in _Papaveraceæ_ and\r\n_Fumariaceæ_, but is absent in _Cruciferæ_ and _Capparidaceæ_.--~This\r\nfamily through the Papaveraceæ is related to the Polycarpicæ (the\r\nNymphæaceæ), through the Capparidaceæ to the Resedaceæ in the next\r\nfamily.~\r\n\r\n   Exceptions to the above are: _Eschscholtzia_, _Subularia_ (Fig.\r\n   403) and a few Capparidaceæ, in which perigynous flowers are\r\n   found. A few Papaveraceæ and Fumariaceæ have trimerous flowers.\r\n   In _Fumaria_ and certain Cruciferæ, the fruit is a nut. The\r\n   Fumariaceæ have zygomorphic flowers. Trees and shrubs are almost\r\n   entirely confined to the Capparidaceæ, in which order stipules\r\n   also are found.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Papaveraceæ= (=Poppies=). Herbaceous plants with stiff hairs\r\nand _latex_; flowers _regular_ (Fig. 391) with generally 2 (-3) sepals\r\n(which _fall off_ as the flower opens), 2 + 2 petals (imbricate\r\nand crumpled in the bud) _without spur, numerous stamens in several\r\nalternating whorls_ (generally a multiple of 2); carpels 2–several,\r\nunited into a unilocular gynœceum. Trimerous flowers also occur.\r\nCapsule with very numerous seeds on the parietal placentæ; embryo\r\nsmall, with large, oleaginous _endosperm_ (Fig. 392).--The leaves have\r\nno stipules and are generally pinnately lobed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 391.--A Diagram of the flower of _Glaucium_\r\n  and the dichasium (which becomes transformed into a scorpioid\r\n  cyme). _B Papaver argemone_, transverse section of the ovary\r\n  with indication of the position of the stigmas.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 392.--_Papaver somniferum_: _A_ capsule;\r\n  _st_ the stigma; _v_ valves; _h_ pores; _B_ seed in longitudinal\r\n  section; _alb_ endosperm; _emb_ embryo.]\r\n\r\n_Papaver_ (Poppy) has large, solitary, terminal flowers; petals firmly\r\nand irregularly folded in æstivation; gynœceum formed by many (4–15)\r\ncarpels; stigmas velvety, _sessile_ and _stellate_ (the rays stand\r\nabove the placentæ) (Fig. 391 _B_). The edges of the carpels project\r\ndeeply into the ovary, but do not meet in the centre, so that it\r\nremains unilocular. The capsule opens by pores placed close beneath\r\nthe stigma, and formed of small valves alternating with the placentæ\r\nand the rays of the stigma (Fig. 391). _P. dubium_, _P. argemone_, _P.\r\nrhœas_.--_Chelidonium_ (Greater Celandine) has _yellow_ latex, flowers\r\nin umbellate cymes (the terminal, central flower opening first) and\r\nonly 2 carpels; the fruit resembles the siliqua of the Cruciferæ in\r\nhaving two _barren valves_, which are detached from the base upwards,\r\nand a _seed-bearing frame_, but there is no partition wall formed\r\nbetween the placentæ. _Ch. majus._--~The majority of the other genera\r\nhave, like _Chelidonium_, 2 carpels (lateral and alternating with the\r\nsepals: Fig. 391 _A_) and siliqua-like fruit, thus: _Eschscholtzia_\r\n(perigynous) with a linear, stigma-bearing prolongation extending as\r\nfar above the placentæ as above the dorsal suture of the carpels;\r\n_Glaucium_ (Horn-Poppy); _G. luteum_, whose extremely long, thin\r\ncapsule differs from that of _Chelidonium_ by the formation, during\r\nripening, of a thick, spongy (_false_) replum, which persists when\r\nthe valves are detached; _Sanguinaria_ with red latex, the 2 petals\r\ndivided into 8–12 small petals (perhaps by dédoublement); _Macleya_ and\r\n_Bocconia_ (1-seeded capsule) with 2 sepals and no petals.--Trimerous\r\nflowers are found in _Argemone_ and _Platystemon_ (with a curious\r\nfruit, carpels free, and transversely divided and constricted into\r\njoints which separate as nut-like portions).--_Meconopsis._--_Hypecoum_\r\n(Fig. 393 _C_) has tri-lobed and three cleft petals, 4 free stamens\r\nwith 4-locular anthers and a jointed siliqua; it presents a\r\ntransitional form to the Fumariaceæ, with which order it is sometimes\r\nincluded.~\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. _Papaver_ and _Chelidonium_ have no honey, and\r\n   are without doubt only visited by insects for the sake of\r\n   the pollen. The anthers and stigmas mature about the same\r\n   time.--There are 80 species; especially from warm climates.\r\n   OFFICINAL: _Papaver somniferum_ (Opium-Poppy); the latex\r\n   of its unripe capsules is obtained by incisions, and dried\r\n   (_opium_); it contains many alkaloids: morphine, papaverine,\r\n   narcotine, thebaine, etc. The oleaginous seeds are also used\r\n   in the manufacture of oil. Its home is in the East, where it\r\n   is extensively cultivated. The petals of the Corn-poppy (_P.\r\n   rhœas_) are also officinal. Several species are cultivated as\r\n   ornamental plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Fumariacæ= (=Fumitories=). This order differs from the\r\nclosely allied Papaveraceæ in the absence of latex, a poorer flower,\r\ngenerally _transversely zygomorphic_ (Fig. 393 _B_), in which case one\r\nor both of the outer lateral petals are gibbous, or prolonged into\r\na spur; the stamens are especially anomalous. Sepals =2=, caducous;\r\npetals 2 + 2; stamens 2, _tripartite_; each lateral anther is\r\n_bilocular_ (Figs. 393 _A_, _B_; 395); gynœceum bicarpellate. The fruit\r\nis a nut or siliqua-like capsule. _Endosperm._--_Herbs_ with scattered,\r\nrepeatedly pinnately-divided leaves without stipules, generally quite\r\nglabrous and glaucous; the flowers are arranged in racemes with\r\nsubtending bracts, but the bracteoles are sometimes suppressed.\r\n\r\n_Dicentra_ (syn. _Dielytra_) and _Adlumia_ have a doubly symmetrical\r\nflower, with a spur or gibbous swelling at the base of _each_ of\r\nthe laterally-placed petals (Figs. 393 _A_, 394). _Corydalis_ has a\r\nzygomorphic flower, _only one of_ the lateral petals _having a spur_,\r\nand consequently there is only one nectary at the base of the bundle of\r\nstamens, which stands right in front of the spur (Fig. 393 _B_, 395,\r\n396). The fruit is a many-seeded siliqua-like capsule. ~A peculiarity\r\nof the flower is that the plane of symmetry passes _transversely_\r\nthrough the flowers, whilst in nearly all other zygomorphic flowers\r\nit lies in the median line. Moreover, the flower is turned, so that\r\nthe plane of symmetry ultimately becomes nearly vertical, and the spur\r\nis directed backwards.--Many species have subterranean tubers; in\r\nthese the embryo germinates with _one cotyledon_, which is lanceolate\r\nand resembles a foliage-leaf. The tuber is in some the swollen\r\nhypocotyl (_C. cava_), in others a swollen root (_C. fabacea_, etc.),\r\nwhich grows down through the precisely similar swollen root of the\r\nmother-plant. The sub-genus _Ceratocapnos_ has dimorphic fruits (nuts\r\nand capsules) in the same raceme.~ _Fumaria_ differs from _Corydalis_\r\nonly by its almost drupaceous, one-seeded nut (Fig. 395).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 393.--Diagram of _Dicentra_ (_A_),\r\n  _Corydalis_ (_B_), and _Hypecoum_ (_C_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 394.--_Dicentra spectabilis_: _A_ flower\r\n  (2/5); _B_ the same, after removal of half of one outer petal;\r\n  the cap, formed by the inner petals, is moved away from the\r\n  anthers and stigma; the insect does this with the lower side of\r\n  its abdomen, and thus rubs the stigma on the hairs of its ventral\r\n  surface; the dotted line at _e_ indicates the direction of the\r\n  proboscis; _C_ andrœcium and gynœceum; _D_ stigma.]\r\n\r\n   THE STRUCTURE OF THE FLOWER. _Hypecoum_ among the Papaveraceæ\r\n   is the connecting link with the Fumariaceæ. The diagram (Fig.\r\n   393 _C_) corresponds both in number and in the relative position\r\n   of its members with that of most of the other Papaveraceæ (Fig.\r\n   391), except that there are only four stamens (with extrorse\r\n   anthers). In _Dicentra_ (Fig. 393 _A_), the two central\r\n   (uppermost) stamens are absent, but each of the two lateral ones\r\n   are divided into three filaments, of which the central one bears\r\n   a four-locular anther, and each of the others a two-locular\r\n   (half) anther. _Corydalis_ and _Fumaria_ stand alone in the\r\n   symmetry of the flower, differing from _Dicentra_ in having only\r\n   one of the lateral petals (Fig. 393 _B_, _sp_) prolonged into\r\n   a spur, while in _Dicentra_ both the petals are spurred. This\r\n   structure has been interpreted in various ways. According to Asa\r\n   Gray the median stamens are absent in the last-named genera, and\r\n   the lateral ones are split in a similar manner to the petals of\r\n   _Hypecoum_. Another, and no doubt the most reasonable theory\r\n   (adduced by De Candolle), is: that two median stamens are split,\r\n   the two parts move laterally, each to their respective sides\r\n   and become united with the two lateral stamens; this affords a\r\n   natural explanation of the two half-anthers, and establishes a\r\n   close relationship to the Cruciferæ. A third interpretation,\r\n   held by Eichler and others, is as follows: the median stamens\r\n   are _always_ wanting; when they appear to be present, as in\r\n   _Hypecoum_, it is due to the fact that the side portions of\r\n   the lateral stamens _approach each other_ (as interpetiolar\r\n   stipules) and coalesce into an apparently single stamen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 395.--_Fumaria officinalis_: _A_ the flower\r\n  in longitudinal section; _B_ the andrœcium and gynœceum; nectary\r\n  to the right.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 396.--_Corydalis cava_: _a_ a flower (lateral\r\n  view); _b_ the anthers lying round the stigma; _c_ the anthers\r\n  shortly before the opening of the flower; _d_ the head of the\r\n  stigma; _e_ relative position of the parts of the flower during\r\n  the visit of an insect.]\r\n\r\n   130 species; mostly from the northern temperatures.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. _Fumaria_, with its inconspicuous flowers, has to\r\n   a great extent to resort to self-pollination. _Corydalis_, on\r\n   the other hand, is dependent on cross-pollination; _C. cava_\r\n   is even absolutely sterile with its own pollen. _Corydalis_\r\n   is pollinated by insects with long probosces (humble-bees,\r\n   bees), which are able to reach the honey secreted in the spur;\r\n   as they alight on the flowers they press the exterior petals\r\n   on one side (Fig. 396 _e_), so that the stigma, surrounded by\r\n   the anthers, projects forward; the proboscis is introduced in\r\n   the direction of the arrow in the figure, and during this act\r\n   the under-surface of the insect is covered with pollen, which\r\n   is transferred by similar movements to the stigma of another\r\n   (older) flower.--Ornamental plants; _Dicentra_ (_spectabilis_\r\n   and _eximia_), _Adlumia_, _Corydalis_.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Cruciferæ (Crucifers).= The flowers are _regular_, ☿; sepals\r\n4, free (2 + 2), deciduous; petals 4, free, deciduous, unguiculate,\r\nplaced _diagonally_ in one whorl, and alternating with the sepals;\r\nstamens 6; the 2 _outer_ are _short_, the 4 _inner_ (in reality the two\r\nmedian split to the base) _longer_, placed in pairs (tetradynamia of\r\nLinnæus); gynœceum syncarpous formed by 2 (as in the previous order,\r\nlateral) carpels, with 2 parietal placentæ, but divided into two\r\nloculi by a _spurious_ membranous dissepiment (_replum_) (Fig. 397).\r\nStyle single, with a capitate, usually two-lobed stigma, generally\r\ncommisural, that is, placed above the parietal placentæ (Fig. 397), but\r\nit may also be placed above the dorsal suture, or remain undivided.\r\nOvules _curved_. The fruit is generally a bivalvular _siliqua_ (Fig.\r\n398 _B_, _C_), the valves separating from below upwards, and leaving\r\nthe placentæ attached to the replum; other forms of fruits are\r\ndescribed below. The oily seeds _have no endosperm_ (endosperm is\r\npresent in the two previous orders); the _embryo is curved_ (Figs.\r\n398 _E_, _F_; 399, 400).--In general they are _herbaceous_ plants,\r\nwithout latex, with scattered, penninerved leaves, without stipules;\r\nthe inflorescence is very characteristic, namely, a raceme with the\r\nflowers aggregated together at the time of flowering into a corymb, and\r\n_destitute of both bracts and bracteoles_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 397.--Diagram of a Cruciferous flower.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 398.--_Brassica oleracea_: _A_ raceme; _B_,\r\n  _C_ siliqua; _D_ seed; _E_ embryo; _F_ transverse section of\r\n  seed.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 399.--Transverse section of seed and embryo\r\n  of _Cheiranthus cheiri_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 400.--Transverse section of seed of\r\n  _Sisymbrium alliaria_.]\r\n\r\n   Many are biennial, forming in the first year a close\r\n   leaf-rosette. By cultivation the tap-root can readily be induced\r\n   to swell out into the form of a tuber (Turnips, Swedes, etc.).\r\n   _Stipules_ are found indicated by small glands on the very\r\n   young leaves; in _Cochlearia armoracia_ they are fairly large\r\n   triangular scales. _Stellate hairs_ often occur. _Floral-leaves_\r\n   are occasionally developed. Terminal flowers are never found in\r\n   the inflorescences. _Iberis_ and _Teesdalia_ have _zygomorphic_\r\n   flowers. _Subularia_ (Fig. 403) is perigynous. The 2 external\r\n   sepals (Fig. 397) stand in the median plane; it may therefore\r\n   be supposed that there are two bracteoles outside these which,\r\n   however, are suppressed, and can only in a few instances be\r\n   traced in the young flower; the two lateral sepals are often\r\n   gibbous at the base, and serve as reservoirs for the nectar\r\n   secreted by the glands placed above them; they correspond in\r\n   position to the external petals of the Fumariaceæ. The 4 petals\r\n   which follow next arise simultaneously, and alternate with the\r\n   4 sepals; if it could be shown that these are merely 2 median\r\n   petals, which have been deeply cleft and the two parts separated\r\n   from each other and displaced to the diagonal position, there\r\n   would be a perfect correspondence with the Fumariaceous flower;\r\n   then the petals would be followed in regular alternation by the\r\n   2 lateral small stamens, the 2 median long stamens, which it\r\n   has been proved are split into 4 and placed in couples, and the\r\n   2 laterally-placed carpels,--in all 6 dimerous whorls. But the\r\n   formation of the corolla by the splitting of 2 petals does not\r\n   agree with the development of the flower or bear comparison, and\r\n   hence the only fact in favour of this theory is the otherwise\r\n   prevailing correspondence with the Fumariaceæ. Yet it may\r\n   be observed that in special cases each pair of long stamens\r\n   clearly enough arises from one protuberance and even later\r\n   on may be considerably united or entirely undivided (_e.g._\r\n   _Vella_); in other instances they are quite distinct from the\r\n   beginning, and it is possible that this latter condition has\r\n   become constant in the corolla. _Lepidium ruderale_ and others\r\n   have no corolla. _Senebiera didyma_ has only 2 median stamens.\r\n   _Megacarpæa_ has several stamens, no doubt by dédoublement, as\r\n   in Capparidaceæ.--The _number of carpels_ may also be abnormally\r\n   increased; _Tetrapoma barbareifolium_ has normally 4 carpels\r\n   with an equal number of placentæ and repla. It is supposed to\r\n   be a variety of _Nasturtium palustre_.--The 2–4–8–10 greenish\r\n   _glands_, which are found at the base of the stamens, are\r\n   nectaries, morphologically emergences, and not rudimentary\r\n   stamens. The forms of _fruits_ are of great systematic\r\n   significance, see the genera. In some species dimorphic fruits\r\n   are present, _e.g. Cardamine chenopodiifolia_ which has both\r\n   ordinary _Cardamine_-siliquas and 1-seeded siliculas.\r\n\r\n   The _curved embryo_ appears in five forms, which have\r\n   systematic importance: 1. To the PLEURORHIZÆ belong those\r\n   genera whose radicle (with the hypocotyl) lies bent upwards\r\n   along the _edge_ of the _flat_ cotyledons (Fig. 399); to\r\n   this group belong _Cardamine_, _Nasturtium_, _Cheiranthus_,\r\n   _Matthiola_, _Cochlearia_, _Draba_, _Iberis_, _Thlaspi_, etc.;\r\n   diagrammatic transverse section: ◯=.--2. To NOTORHIZÆ belong\r\n   those whose radicle lies in an upward direction along the\r\n   _back_ of one of the _flat_ cotyledons (Figs. 400, 413); _e.g._\r\n   _Hesperis_, _Sisymbrium_, _Lepidium_, _Capsella_, _Camelina_:\r\n   ◯‖.--3. ORTHOPLOCEÆ differ from the Notorhizeæ in having the\r\n   cotyledons folded (not flat) (Fig. 398 _E_, _F_); to this belong\r\n   _Brassica_, _Sinapis_, _Raphanus_, _Crambe_, etc.: ◯>>.--4.\r\n   SPIROLOBEÆ: the radicle lies as in the Notorhizæ, but the\r\n   cotyledons are so rolled together that a transverse section of\r\n   the seed cuts them twice; _Bunias_: ◯‖‖.--5. DIPLECOLOBEÆ: the\r\n   cotyledons are folded forward and backward so that a transverse\r\n   section cuts them several times; _Subularia_, _Senebiera_: ◯‖‖‖.\r\n\r\nOn _germination_ the cotyledons appear above the ground as green\r\nleaves; in the Orthoploceæ they are bilobed, in the _Lepidium_-species\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\n1. =Silicula, broad replum= (Siliculosæ latiseptæ), valves flat or\r\nslightly vaulted, and the replum extends through the greatest width of\r\nthe silicula (Fig. 404). The seeds are situated in two rows.\r\n\r\n◯=: _Cochlearia_ (Horse-radish): the siliqua is nearly spheroid;\r\nglabrous herbs, generally with fleshy, stalked leaves, and white\r\nflowers.--_Draba_ has an oblong, lanceolate, somewhat compressed\r\nsilicula; herbs with small rosettes of leaves, most frequently with\r\nstellate and long-stalked racemes.--_Alyssum_ and _Berteroa_ are\r\nwhitish, on account of the stellate hairs; they have a more compressed\r\nand round or elliptical silicula. _Vesicaria_; _Aubrietia_. _Lunaria_\r\n(Honesty, Fig. 401): very broad and flat silicula with long stalk (the\r\nreceptacle as in Capparidaceæ).\r\n\r\n◯‖: _Camelina_ (Gold-of-pleasure) has a spheroid, pear-shaped siliqua\r\nwith a small rim passing right round (Fig. 402). _Subularia_ (Awlwort),\r\nan aquatic plant with _perigynous_ flower (Fig. 403) and folded\r\ncotyledons.\r\n\r\n2. =Silicula, narrow replum= (Siliculosæ angustiseptæ), _i.e._ the\r\nreplum is much shorter than the arched, more or less boat-shaped valves\r\n(Figs. 405, 406, 407).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 401.--_Lunaria biennis._ Fruit, the valves of\r\n  which have fallen off.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 402.--_Camelina sativa._ Fruit.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 403.--_Subularia aquatica._ Longitudinal\r\n  section through the flower.]\r\n\r\n◯=: _Thlaspi_ (Penny-Cress) has a flat, almost circular silicula,\r\nemarginate or cordate, with a well-developed wing round the edge (Fig.\r\n406). _Iberis_ and _Teesdalia_: the racemes during flowering are\r\nespecially corymbose, and the most external petals of the outer flowers\r\nproject radially and are much larger than the other two (the flower is\r\n_zygomorphic_).--_Biscutella_, _Megacarpæa_.\r\n\r\n◯‖: _Capsella_ (Shepherd’s-Purse) has a wingless, obcordate or\r\ntriangular silicula (Fig. 407). _Lepidium_ (Pepperwort) has a few–(2–4)\r\nseeded, slightly winged, oval silicula. _Senebiera_ has a silicula\r\nsplitting longitudinally into two nut-like portions; its cotyledons are\r\nfolded.--~_Anastatica hierochuntica_ (“Rose of Jericho”) is an annual,\r\nsilicula-fruited, desert plant (Arabia, Syria, N. Africa). After the\r\nflowering all its then leafless branches bend together upwards, forming\r\na kind of ball; this spreads out again on coming in contact with water,\r\nand the fruits then disseminate their seeds, which germinate very\r\nquickly, often in the fruit.~\r\n\r\n3. =Siliqua= (Siliquosæ). The fruit is a true siliqua, several times\r\nlonger than broad.

The fruit has only 2 joints. The lower\r\none resembles a short, thick stalk, and is barren, the upper one is\r\nspherical, and has 1 seed.--_Cakile_ (_C. maritima_, Sea-kale); the\r\nlower node is triangular, 1-locular, the upper one more ensiform,\r\n1-locular (Fig. 409).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 408.--Fruit of _Crambe maritima_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 409.--_Cakile maritima._ Fruit (2/1).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 410.--_Raphanus raphanistrum._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 411.--_Raphanus sativus._]\r\n\r\n◯>>: _Raphanus_ has a long siliqua, which, in the garden Radish (_R.\r\nsativus_), is spongy and slightly abstricted (Fig. 411), but neither\r\nopens nor divides transversely (a kind of dry berry), and which in the\r\nWild Radish (_R. raphanistrum_) (Fig. 410) is abstricted in the form\r\nof a string of pearls, and separates into many joints. ~_R. sativus_;\r\nthe “Radish” is formed by the hypocotyl, after the bursting of its\r\nexternal, cortical portions (of which there are generally two patches\r\nat the top of the Radish).~\r\n\r\n5. =Siliqua indehiscent= (Nucumentaceæ). The fruit is a short,\r\n_unjointed_, unilocular and 1-seeded nut, and the fruit-stalks are\r\noften long, slender, and drooping.

THELYPODIEÆ. Stigma equally developed on all sides; style\r\n           undivided or prolonged above the middle of the carpels,\r\n           or turned back.--_Stanleyinæ_; _Heliophilinæ_.\r\n\r\n      2.

(Mag.)]\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. Honey is secreted by the nectaries mentioned\r\n   above; but the position of the stamens is not always the most\r\n   favourable for pollination by insects (in these flowers the\r\n   honey-seeking insect must touch the anthers with one of its\r\n   sides and the stigma with the other), and self-fertilisation\r\n   is common. In some species (_Cardamine pratensis_) the long\r\n   stamens turn their anthers outwards towards the small stamens,\r\n   so that 3 anthers surround each of the two large entrances to\r\n   the nectaries.\r\n\r\n   1200 species (180 genera), especially in the cold and\r\n   temperate parts of the Old World (Europe, W. Asia). Many\r\n   are _weeds_ in this country, _e.g._ Wild Cabbage (_Brassica\r\n   campestris_), Charlock (_Sinapis arvensis_), Wild Radish\r\n   (_Raphanus raphanistrum_) and others.--The order is acrid and\r\n   oleaginous. Oil is obtained from many of the oil-containing\r\n   seeds, especially of the Rape (_Brassica napus_), Summer-Rape\r\n   (the oil-yielding cultivated form of the Field-Cabbage) and\r\n   _Camelina_. Several are pot-herbs or fodder plants, _e.g._\r\n   Cabbage\r\n\r\n   (_Brassica oleracea_) with its numerous varieties: Cauliflower\r\n   (var. _botrytis_; the entire inflorescence is abnormally\r\n   branched and fleshy), Kohlrabi (var. _gongylodes_, with\r\n   swollen, tuberous stem), Kale, Red-Cabbage, White-Cabbage,\r\n   etc.; _B. campestris_, var. _rapifera_ (Turnip); _B. napus_,\r\n   var. _rapifera_ (Swede); _Raphanus sativus_ (Radish from W.\r\n   Asia), _R. caudatus_ (long Radish); _Nasturtium officinale_\r\n   (Water Cress), _Lepidium sativum_ (Garden Cress), and _Barbarea\r\n   præcox_ (Early Cress); _Crambe maritima_ (Sea-Kkale). The\r\n   seeds of the following are especially used as spices: (the\r\n   flour of) _Melanosinapis_ (Black-mustard), and _Sinapis\r\n   alba_ (White-mustard), which are _officinal_ like the root\r\n   of _Cochlearia armoracia_ (Horse-radish, E. Eur.). The\r\n   herbaceous parts of _Cochlearia officinalis_ and _danica_\r\n   are medicinal.--A blue dye (woad) is extracted from\r\n   _Isatis_.--Ornamental plants: _Cheiranthus cheiri_ (Wallflower),\r\n   _Matthiola_ (Stock), _Iberis_, _Hesperis_, _Lunaria_, and others\r\n   (especially from S. Eur.). Sweet-scented flowers are rare.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 414.--_Gynandropsis pentaphylla._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 415.--_Capparis spinosa._]\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Capparidaceæ= (=Capers=). The relationship with the\r\n   Cruciferæ is so close that certain forms are with difficulty\r\n   distinguished from them. The diagram of the flower is the same\r\n   in the number and position of its parts, but it differs in the\r\n   modifications which occur in the development of the stamens. In\r\n   some genera all 4 stamens are undivided; in others both the 2\r\n   median ones are divided as in the Cruciferæ (6 stamens, but _not\r\n   tetradynamous_) (Fig. 414); in other genera only 1 of these; in\r\n   other instances again they are divided into more than 2; and\r\n   finally the 2 lateral ones also may be found divided, so that\r\n   _indefinite stamens_ occur (Fig. 415). The bicarpellate gynœceum\r\n   is _unilocular_ (without replum), but more than 2 carpels may\r\n   occur. The ovary is elevated on a _stalk_ (sometimes as much\r\n   as 1 foot in length); also between the stamens and corolla a\r\n   similar stalk may be found (Fig. 414). The fruit is long and\r\n   siliquose (_Cleome_, _Polanisia_, _Gynandropsis_), or a berry\r\n   (_Capparis_). Endosperm absent. Some have zygomorphic flowers.\r\n   Gamosepalous calyx and perigynous flowers also occur.--350\r\n   species; especially in the Tropics. The majority are trees\r\n   and shrubs, and they differ also from the Cruciferæ in having\r\n   distinct stipules present in some species.\r\n\r\n   “Capers” are the flower buds of the climbing, thorny shrub,\r\n   _Capparis spinosa_ (Fig. 415), which grows in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 11. =Cistifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers in this family are perfect, regular (except _Resedaceæ,\r\nViolaceæ_), hypogynous, the perianth-leaves free (a few have them\r\nslightly united), æstivation most frequently imbricate; they are\r\neucyclic in the andrœcium, and most frequently in the other parts,\r\nand generally 5-merous with S5, P5, A5 + 5, G3, but other numbers\r\nalso occur; several have _indefinite stamens_, but the stamens arise\r\n(where the development is known) in _centrifugal order_ and are\r\narranged, often very distinctly, _in bundles_; in other words, the\r\nlarge number of stamens is formed by the splitting of a small number\r\n(most frequently 5); a true spiral arrangement is never found. Gynœceum\r\nsyncarpous, multicarpellary (_Dilleniaceæ_ and a few _Resedaceæ_ are\r\napocarpous), most frequently the number of carpels is 3, forming a\r\n_unilocular ovary_ with _parietal placentæ_, but parallel with this,\r\nmultilocular ovaries, with the ovules placed in the inner angle of the\r\nloculi, are also found, and a few genera have a free, centrally-placed\r\nplacenta. The fruit is most frequently a capsule. The dehiscence is\r\nnever with a “replum,” _i.e._ the persistent frame of the placenta,\r\nas in the family Rhœadinæ. One half of the orders has endosperm\r\n(_Violaceæ_, _Cistaceæ_, _Droseraceæ_, _Bixaceæ_, _Ternstrœmiaceæ_,\r\netc.), the other has no endosperm (_Resedaceæ_, _Hypericaceæ_,\r\n_Elatinaceæ_, _Tamaricaceæ_, etc.); some have a curved, the majority a\r\nstraight embryo. ~The family is scarcely quite natural; in the future\r\nthe orders will probably be arranged differently.~\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Resedaceæ (Mignonettes).=--Herbs or small shrubs with\r\nspirally-placed leaves and very small, gland-like stipules (as in\r\nCruciferæ); the ☿, hypogynous flowers are _zygomorphic_, and arranged\r\nin racemes or spikes typically without bracteoles. The zygomorphic\r\nstructure is produced by the _greater development of the posterior side\r\nof the flower_, especially the petals and the nectary (“disc,” in Fig.\r\n416 _d_) which is situated between the petals and stamens; in general\r\nthere are 5–8 free sepals and petals, the latter consisting of a large\r\nscale-like _sheath_ with a fimbriated blade (see Fig. 416); stamens\r\nnumerous; carpels 6–2 united together; ovary unilocular with parietal\r\nplacentæ, but _the cavity of the ovary is not closed_ at the top. In\r\n_Astrocarpus_ the gynœceum is apocarpous. The fruit is most frequently\r\na capsule; the seeds are reniform, without endosperm, and the embryo is\r\n_curved_.\r\n\r\n   This order connects the Rhœadinæ with the Cistifloræ. It is\r\n   closely allied to the Rhœadinæ by its external appearance, even\r\n   by the smell and taste, the parietal placentation, structure of\r\n   the seeds, the inflorescences, etc., whilst by the irregular\r\n   flowers and the disc placed at the posterior side of the\r\n   flower, _it is allied to Capparidaceæ_, but differs from this\r\n   order in not having its characteristic number (2–4) and by\r\n   the very different mode of dehiscence of the fruit, etc. It\r\n   differs from the other orders of this family chiefly in the\r\n   fact that the number of the perianth-leaves is not constantly\r\n   5. In _Reseda luteola_ both the calyx and corolla appear to\r\n   be 4-leaved, because the posterior sepal is suppressed, and\r\n   the 2 posterior petals are united. Where there are 10 stamens,\r\n   they stand in 2 whorls, _i.e._ in front of the sepals and\r\n   petals; if there are several, their position depends upon the\r\n   splitting.--_Astrocarpus_ is remarkable for its apocarpous fruit\r\n   and the position of the ovules on the _dorsal_ suture of the\r\n   carpel.\r\n\r\n   The yellow, flat disc at the back of the flower serves as a\r\n   nectary, the honey being protected by the lobes of the petals.\r\n   If pollination by insects is not effected, then self-pollination\r\n   may take place, at all events in _R. odorata_.\r\n\r\n   45 species; the majority in the Mediterranean and in Persia.\r\n   _Reseda odorata_ (from Egypt) is cultivated on account of its\r\n   sweet scent; _R. luteola_ (“Dyer’s Weed”) yields a yellow dye.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 416.--Diagram of _Reseda odorata_.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Droseraceæ (Sundews).= Herbs, chiefly living on moors or in\r\nwater, and whose leaves are adapted to catch and digest small animals.\r\nWith regard to the flower, they are closely allied to the Violaceæ,\r\nespecially to those with regular flowers. _Drosera_ (Sundew) has a\r\nlong-stalked scorpioid cyme with regular, ☿, hypogynous flowers,\r\n5-merous as in _Viola_. S5, P5, A5, G3 (in a syncarpous gynœceum,\r\nwith free, bifid styles and basal or parietally-placed ovules in the\r\nunilocular ovaries). The capsule opens also as in _Viola_, but, among\r\nother differences, the styles are free, the seeds very small, and\r\nsurrounded by a loosely lying, thin shell. ~_Drosera_ has radical,\r\nlong-stalked leaves with the blade (Fig. 417) covered by numerous\r\nstrong glandular hairs, placed on the edge and in the middle; when\r\nsmall animals are caught by these hairs, the latter and the entire\r\nblade close slowly over them dissolving and absorbing all the\r\ndigestible matter as nourishment.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 417.--Leaf-rosette of _Drosera rotundifolia_\r\n  (nat. size), and a leaf (magnified).]\r\n\r\n   _Dionæa muscipula_ (Fly-trap; N. Am.) has the same appearance\r\n   as _Drosera_, but the leaves are constructed as in Fig. 418.\r\n   The stalk is flat and winged, the blade small, circular, with\r\n   powerful, pointed teeth along the edge, and on its surface are 6\r\n   small bristles (_A_), which are very sensitive. When these are\r\n   touched the blade quickly closes, folding along the midrib (_B_,\r\n   _C_) and imprisoning the irritating object, the teeth round the\r\n   edges fitting like the teeth of a trap. If it happens to be an\r\n   insect or similar body, a digestive fluid is secreted which,\r\n   like the gastric juice, dissolves the digestible portions.\r\n   _Aldrovandia vesiculosa_ (Central and S. Europe) captures small\r\n   aquatic animals in a similar manner; it is a floating, aquatic\r\n   plant, the two halves of its leaves also close together when\r\n   irritated (Fig. 419).--_Drosophyllum._\r\n\r\n   About 110 species; most of them in the temperate regions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 418.--_Dionæa muscipula._ Leaves (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n   Orders 3 and 4. =Sarraceniaceæ and Nepenthaceæ.= These two\r\n   orders are perhaps most closely allied to the Droseraceæ and\r\n   agree with these, among other things, in the manner of taking\r\n   nourishment. Like the Droseraceæ they absorb nitrogenous food\r\n   from dissolved animal matter by means of their leaves, which are\r\n   specially constructed both to catch, to retain, and to digest\r\n   any small animals which may be caught. The SARRACENIACEÆ are\r\n   North American marsh-plants (10 species) which have pitcher-like\r\n   leaf-stalks, in the cavity of which a fluid (with properties\r\n   approaching those of gastric juice) is secreted, and which bear\r\n   at the apex a small, lid-like blade; these leaf-stalks are the\r\n   catching and digestive organs.--_Sarracenia, Darlingtonia._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 419.--_Aldrovandia vesiculosa_: _A_ a plant\r\n  (nat. size). _B_ Leaf (mag.); the blade is closed; the winged\r\n  stalk is prolonged into 4–6 irritable bristles.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 420.--_Nepenthes_ (reduced).]\r\n\r\n   NEPENTHACEÆ has only 1 genus, _Nepenthes_ (the Pitcher-plant;\r\n   about 35 species), especially found in tropical E. Asia; the\r\n   majority are climbing shrubs. The leaf-stalks are twining\r\n   organs, and terminate either simply in a tendril, or in addition\r\n   to this, with a pitcher-shaped body (which in some species may\r\n   be as much as a foot in length) on whose upper edge a lid-like\r\n   structure is found (Fig. 420). In this pitcher, as among the\r\n   Sarraceniaceæ, a fluid is secreted which is able to digest the\r\n   animals captured (sometimes rather large) and which corresponds\r\n   in some degree to the gastric juice.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Violaceæ (Violets).= The flowers are ☿, and generally\r\nzygomorphic, hypogynous, with S5, P5, A5, G3 (Fig. 421). The stamens\r\nare closely applied to the ovary, they have a very short filament,\r\nand at their summit generally a membranous appendage formed by the\r\nprolongation of the connective (Fig. 422 _g_). The ovary is unilocular\r\nwith 3 parietal placentæ; style undivided (Fig. 422 _B_). The fruit\r\nis usually a 3-valved capsule, opening along the dorsal sutures\r\n(Fig. 423). Embryo straight; endosperm fleshy (Fig. 425).--Many are\r\nherbaceous plants (_e.g. Viola_), but in the Tropics shrubs are also\r\nfound (_e.g. Ionidium_); a few are lianes; the leaves are scattered,\r\nwith stipules, and involute in the bud.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 421.--Diagram of _Viola_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 422.--The large-flowered form of _Viola\r\n  tricolor_: _A_ the flower in median longitudinal section; _B_ the\r\n  gynœceum.]\r\n\r\n_Viola._ The sepals are prolonged backwards beyond the point of\r\ninsertion (appendiculate); the corolla is polypetalous, descending\r\nimbricate, and zygomorphic, its anterior petal being larger than the\r\nothers and provided with a spur (Fig. 421). The 2 anterior of the 5\r\nalmost sessile stamens are provided with a spur-like nectary, which\r\nprotrudes a considerable distance into the petaloid spur (Figs. 421,\r\n422 _n_, _sp_). The style is club-like, and bears the stigma in a\r\ngroove on the anterior side (Fig. 422 _st_). ~Herbs with rhizomes,\r\nor annuals; flowers solitary. _V. odorata_, _canina_, etc., have\r\ncleistogamic flowers which produce fruit in addition to the large,\r\ncoloured (violet) flowers. The Pansy (_V. tricolor_) has large flowers\r\nadapted for insect-pollination, and also smaller, less conspicuous\r\nones designed for self-pollination. The stigma, as in Fig. 422 _A_,\r\n_st_, and _B_, is situated on the anterior side of the stylar-head,\r\nimmediately in front of the channel leading down to the spur (_sp_);\r\nbelow it is situated a valve, easily covered with pollen when\r\nthe proboscis of an insect is introduced into the spur, but which\r\ncloses upon its withdrawal; cross-pollination is thus secured.--The\r\nsweet-scented _V. odorata_ is visited by the honey-bee, which insures\r\ncross-pollination, and in the absence of insect visits it effects\r\nself-fertilisation by cleistogamic flowers. The conspicuous but\r\nscentless _V. tricolor_, var. _vulgaris_, is less frequently visited by\r\ninsects (humble-bees). In _V. silvatica_ and _V. canina_ the pollen is\r\ncarried on the head or proboscis of the honey-sucking bee.--The fruits\r\nof _V. odorata_ bury themselves slightly in the soil. In the others\r\nthe fruits are raised above the ground; the 3 boat-shaped valves close\r\ntogether along the central line, and eject the seeds, one by one, with\r\nmuch violence, so that they are thrown to a great distance.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 423–425.--_Viola Tricolor._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 423.--Capsule after dehiscence (nat. size).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 424.--External view of the seed.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 425.--Seed in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n   The _Alsodeia_-group has regular or almost regular flowers.\r\n   Gamopetalous corollas are found in _Paypayroleæ_. _Sauvagesieæ_\r\n   differs the most by its regular corolla, and 5–∞ free or united\r\n   staminodes.\r\n\r\n   250 species; especially in the Tropics.--The _Ionidium_-species\r\n   are used as ipecacuanha. A number of _Viola_-species are\r\n   cultivated as garden plants, especially _V. odorata_\r\n   (sweet-scented Violet) and _V. tricolor_, which have a large\r\n   number of varieties.\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Frankeniaceæ.= A small order with doubtful\r\n   relationships. Perennial herbs or shrubs; beach plants with\r\n   nodose stem. Sepals united, petals free. Unilocular ovary,\r\n   with 3–4 parietal placentæ. Fruit a capsule. Embryo straight,\r\n   endospermous. Especially in S. Europe, Africa, on the shores of\r\n   the Mediterranean and Atlantic.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Tamaricaceæ (Tamarisks).= To this order belong only\r\n   _Tamarix_ and _Myricaria_. They are shrubs of a cypress- or\r\n   heather-like appearance, as the scattered leaves are very small,\r\n   sessile, scale-like or linear, adpressed, entire, and usually\r\n   glaucous, and the branches are slender and whip-like. The\r\n   flowers are borne in small spikes or racemes, and are small,\r\n   reddish or whitish, regular, ☿, hypogynous and polypetalous;\r\n   formula S5, P5, A5 + 0 (_Tamarix_, which often has stipular\r\n   teeth at the base of the filaments), or A5 + 5 (_Myricaria_,\r\n   in which the stamens are united at the base); the number 4 may\r\n   appear instead of 5, but in either case there is usually a\r\n   tricarpellate gynœceum, which is _unilocular_ and has either\r\n   parietal placentæ (_Myricaria_) or a small basal placenta\r\n   (_Tamarix_); 1 trifid style, or 3 styles. Capsule dehiscing\r\n   along the dorsal suture, and resembling the Willows in having a\r\n   unilocular ovary with numerous _woolly_ seeds; but the seed-wool\r\n   in this case is borne on the chalaza, and may be attached to a\r\n   long stalk.--Some _Tamarix_-species shed part of their branches\r\n   in the winter.--40 species; North Temperate, on the sea-shores\r\n   or steppes, especially in Asia. Ornamental shrubs: _Myricaria\r\n   germanica_, and _Tamarix gallica_.\r\n\r\nOrder 8. =Cistaceæ.= Shrubs or herbs, natives especially of the\r\nMediterranean region. Flowers generally in raceme-like scorpioid\r\ncymes, regular, ☿, hypogynous; sepals 5, free, _twisted_ in the bud,\r\nof which the two outer are generally much smaller than the others;\r\npetals 5, free, _twisted_ in the bud (in the direction _opposite_\r\nto the sepals), fugacious; stamens _numerous_; gynœceum syncarpous,\r\ncarpels usually 3–5, style simple, ovary unilocular, with parietal\r\nplacentation (seldom divided into loculi, with axile placentation). The\r\novules are _orthotropous_ in opposition to some of the other orders\r\nof this family. The capsule dehisces along the dorsal sutures; embyro\r\n_curved_. The leaves are simple, undivided, generally opposite and\r\nstipulate.--~They are Violaceæ with regular flowers, numerous stamens,\r\nand curved embryo. The numerous stamens are in reality only one or two\r\n5-merous whorls, divided into a large number of stamens; these are\r\nformed, therefore, in descending order, like the lobes of many compound\r\nfoliage-leaves.~\r\n\r\n_Helianthemum_ (Rock-Rose), has 3 carpels.--_Cistus_ has 5 (-10)\r\ncarpels.\r\n\r\n   About 70 species; temperate climates, especially about the\r\n   Mediterranean. The resin of the _Cistus_-species has been used\r\n   medicinally (ladanum).\r\n\r\n   Order 9. =Bixaceæ.= This order is closely allied to the Cistaceæ\r\n   and Ternstrœmiaceæ; like these it has regular, 5-merous,\r\n   hypogynous flowers with numerous stamens, unilocular ovary and\r\n   _parietal_ placentæ; sometimes unisexual flowers; it differs in\r\n   having anatropous ovules, in the æstivation of the sepals, etc.\r\n   All species (about 180) are trees or shrubs, with scattered,\r\n   simple leaves, which usually have stipules, and are occasionally\r\n   dotted with pellucid oil-glands.--_Bixa orellana_ (Trop. Am.)\r\n   is the best known species; it has a 2-valved capsule; the seeds\r\n   are enclosed in a shiny _red, fleshy testa_, which contains the\r\n   well-known orange or yellow dye, annatto.\r\n\r\n   Order 10. =Dilleniaceæ.= Gynœceum usually apocarpous, seed\r\n   arillate. The flower has most frequently S5, P5, and compound\r\n   stamens (one or more bundles); sometimes irregular. 200 species;\r\n   Tropical; woody plants, many lianes.--_Dillenia_, _Candollea_,\r\n   _Pleurandra_, _Davilla_, etc.\r\n\r\n   Order 11. =Elatinaceæ= (=Water-worts=). About 25 species belong\r\n   to this order; especially in temperate climates. They are small,\r\n   creeping, rooted, aquatic plants, with opposite or verticillate\r\n   leaves and _stipules_. The flowers are solitary or situated in\r\n   small dichasia in the leaf-axils, they are small, regular, ☿,\r\n   hypogynous, with free petals, the same number in all 5 whorls\r\n   (Sn, Pn, An + n, Gn), 3-merous (_e.g. Elatine hexandra_),\r\n   4-merous (_e.g. E. hydropiper_), or 5-merous (_Bergia_); the\r\n   corolla-stamens are sometimes suppressed; petals imbricate\r\n   without being twisted; the ovary is 3–4–5-locular, with 3–4–5\r\n   _free styles_; the capsule dehisces septicidally. The seeds are\r\n   orthotropous or curved, often transversely ribbed, endosperm\r\n   wanting. The order is most nearly allied to Hypericaceæ, whose\r\n   primitive form it appears to represent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 426.--Diagram of _Hypericum quadrangulum_:\r\n  _S_ indicates the bud of the helicoid cyme in the axil of the\r\n  bracteole β.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 427.--_Hypericum._ Flower with three bundles\r\n  of stamens.]\r\n\r\nOrder 12. =Hypericaceæ= (=St. John’s-worts=). This order is recognised\r\nby its always _opposite_ or _verticillate_, _simple_, and entire,\r\npenninerved leaves, without stipules, and usually dotted with\r\n_pellucid_ glands; by the always ☿, regular, hypogynous flowers in a\r\ncymose inflorescence; the generally 5-merous calyx and corolla, with\r\nsepals and petals free; the stamens 3–5, numerously branched (Figs.\r\n426, 427); and the gynœceum, 3–5-carpellate, styles usually _free_. The\r\novary is 3–5-locular, or unilocular with 3–5 parietal placentæ. Fruit a\r\ncapsule (dehiscing septicidally) or berry. Endosperm absent.\r\n\r\n   The inflorescence is a _dichasium_ or _helicoid cyme_. The\r\n   structure of the flowers is the same as that of the foregoing\r\n   orders: S5, P5; succeeding these in some cases are two 5-merous\r\n   whorls of stamens in regular alternation, of which the inner\r\n   is epipetalous; but the outer whorl is only represented by 5\r\n   small scales (Fig. 427), or is altogether absent (_Hypericum\r\n   calycinum_, _H. hircinum_), and the inner divided into numerous\r\n   stamens, that is, these 5 stamens are so deeply divided that\r\n   5 _epipetalous_ groups bearing anthers are found (as in the\r\n   Cistaceæ); in other cases the flower becomes _3-merous after\r\n   the petals_, stamens 3 + 3 following in regular alternation\r\n   (Figs. 426, 427), the outer whorl of stamens in these cases is\r\n   also present as staminodes (Fig. 427), or may be altogether\r\n   suppressed. Carpels 3–5. _The petals are often twisted_ in the\r\n   bud, and are then oblique.\r\n\r\n_Hypericum._ Some species have a square stem; in these cases the\r\nleaves are placed opposite the edges. Fruit a capsule.--_Vismia_ has\r\na berry.--~The flowers of _Hypericum_ have no honey, and supply only\r\npollen; self-pollination often takes place.~\r\n\r\n   About 240 species; the tropical ones being often shrubs or\r\n   trees; the others generally perennial shrubs.--_Hypericum_,\r\n   St. John’s-wort, contains a resinous, red matter, which can be\r\n   extracted with alcohol. The American gamboge is the dried sap of\r\n   species of _Vismia_.\r\n\r\n   Order 13. =Guttiferæ=, or =Clusiaceæ=. Closely allied to the\r\n   Hypericaceæ and Ternstrœmiaceæ. Leaves opposite or verticillate.\r\n   The flowers are often unisexual; stamens united; the gynœceum\r\n   has most frequently a sessile, radiating or shield-like stigma.\r\n\r\n   370 species; chiefly in the Tropics (Am.). They are principally\r\n   woody plants and their bark contains a yellow gum resin,\r\n   “gamboge,” which is extracted from _Garcinia morella_ (E. Ind.)\r\n   and others. Mangosteen (_Garcinia mangostana_ S.E. Asia), and\r\n   _Mammea americana_ (W. Ind.), have very delicious fruits.\r\n   To this order also belong _Platonia insignis_, _Pentadesma\r\n   butyracea_ (the Butter-tree), _Clusia_, _Calophyllum_, _Cataba_,\r\n   etc.\r\n\r\nOrder 14. =Ternstrœmiaceæ.= Trees and shrubs with scattered, simple,\r\nand often more or less leathery, evergreen, penninerved leaves, without\r\nstipules (Fig. 428). The two most important genera are: _Camellia_\r\nand the closely allied _Thea_ (by some authorities these are united\r\ninto one genus). The flowers are regular, hypogynous, and situated\r\nsingly on very short stalks. A number of green floral-leaves are placed\r\nbelow the calyx and gradually pass over into the sepals, and the\r\nleaves (5–6) of the calyx again gradually pass over into the corolla\r\n(this being especially marked in _Camellia_), of which the number of\r\nleaves varies (5, 6, 7 and upwards); the calyx and the corolla are\r\n_acyclic_ or _eucyclic_; the petals are slightly united at the base;\r\nstamens _numerous_ in many whorls, the external ones are arranged in\r\nbundles and united with the petals as in the Columniferæ; gynœceum\r\nsyncarpous; styles often _free_ nearly to the base; ovary 3–5-locular,\r\novules numerous in each loculus. The fruit is a woody capsule.--~Other\r\ngenera show more distinctly than these the same structure as in the\r\npreceding orders, namely: S5, P5, A5 + 5, of which the calyx-stamens\r\nare often suppressed, and the petal-stamens divided into numerous\r\nstamens.--_Kielmeyera_ (S. Am.)~\r\n\r\n   260 species; especially in the Tropics (E. Asia, Am.) The\r\n   leaves of _Thea chinensis_ (or _Camellia thea_), the Tea-tree\r\n   (E. Asia), are cultivated for the well-known “tea,” and contain\r\n   theine: the best are the young, still hairy leaves, of greyish\r\n   colour; there are many varieties. Ornamental plants, _Camellia\r\n   japonica_ and _Actinidia_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 428.--_Thea chinensis_ (reduced).]\r\n\r\n   Closely allied to this order are: Order 15. =Rhizoboleæ= (with\r\n   enormously large hypocotyl--hence the name), and Order 16.\r\n   =Marcgraviaceæ= (partly epiphytes, with dimorphic leaves and\r\n   cup- or helmet-like, coloured, honey-secreting floral-leaves,\r\n   which serve to attract insects).\r\n\r\n   Order 17. =Dipterocarpaceæ.= This order has taken its name from\r\n   the large wings attached to the fruits in _Dipterocarpus_ (the\r\n   wings being largely developed sepals); trees and shrubs from\r\n   Trop. Asia. 180 species. Camphor ready prepared is found in the\r\n   stem of _Dryobalanops camphora_. _Hopea_; _Vateria_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 12. =Gruinales.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers are hypogynous, ☿, polypetalous, usually regular (except\r\n_Pelargonium_, _Tropæolaceæ_, _Balsaminaceæ_) and _throughout\r\n5-merous_: S5, P5, A5 + 5, or 5 + 0, G5 (_epipetalous_). The stamens\r\nsoon fall off and are _obdiplostemonous_, often united at the base\r\n(_monadelphous_); the corolla-stamens are in some completely suppressed\r\n(_e.g. Balsaminaceæ_, Fig. 438), in others reduced to teeth (_Linum_,\r\nFig. 431; _Erodium_). The _Tropæolaceæ_ have 3 carpels and only 8\r\nstamens (Fig. 437). Ring-like nectaries are not present, but at most\r\nonly glandular bodies, borne outside the base of the stamens. Ovaries\r\nmany-locular. The ovules as a rule are pendulous, with the micropyle\r\ndirected outwards (Fig. 431, B), and the radicle therefore also points\r\noutwards. Usually _herbs_. Related to the Columniferæ.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Oxalidaceæ.= Most of the species are herbs with rhizomes;\r\nthe leaves are stalked, _compound_, with entire leaflets which are\r\nfolded and bent backwards in the bud (and in the sleep position),\r\nexstipulate; some species have sensitive leaves. The flowers (Fig. 429)\r\nare regular, and have S5, P5, which are _twisted_ to the left or right\r\nin æstivation, A5 + 5, all united at the base (monadelphous), gynœceum\r\n5-carpellate, _styles 5 free_, stigmas capitate, ovary 5-locular,\r\novules numerous. The fruit is a _capsule opening_ with clefts _on the\r\ndorsal sutures_ through which the seeds are ejected, while the _fleshy,\r\nexternal layer of the testa_ springs off elastically. Embryo straight.\r\nEndosperm.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 429.--Diagram of _Oxal’s acetosella_.]\r\n\r\n   _Oxalis_ (Wood-Sorrel). Leaves digitate. Species also occur\r\n   with phyllodia, _i.e._ leaf-like petioles placed vertically\r\n   without lamina; a few have pinnate leaves. The flowers are\r\n   situated singly or in dichasia, and unipared scorpioid cymes.\r\n   The pollination is effected by insects. Some species are\r\n   trimorphic (long-, short-, medium-styled flowers) and some,\r\n   _e.g. O. acetosella_, have cleistogamic flowers in addition\r\n   to the ordinary ones. Glands are found on the outer side of\r\n   the corolla-stamens or of all the stamens. _O. tetraphylla_\r\n   and others have adventitious edible roots, resembling\r\n   tap-roots.--_Averrhoa_ is a tropical tree, with berries and\r\n   pinnate leaves.\r\n\r\n   235 species (205 belong to _Oxalis_); chiefly in S. Africa and\r\n   Trop. America.--Oxalate of potash is contained in the leaves of\r\n   _Oxalis_.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Linaceæ.= Herbs with scattered or opposite, sessile,\r\n_simple_, small, entire leaves, without (rarely with small) stipules.\r\nThe flowers (Fig. 430) are regular, 5- or 4-merous. Petals are free,\r\n_twisted_, quickly falling off. Stamens united at the base; the\r\npetal-stamens _are either reduced to teeth_ (Fig. 431 _A_, _m_) _or\r\nentirely suppressed_. _Styles free._ The (5–4) epipetalous loculi\r\nof the ovary are incompletely halved by _false divisional walls_,\r\neach half contains one ovule (Fig. 431 _C_). The fruit is a spherical\r\n_capsule, dehiscing along the divisional wall_ (Fig. 432); the 10 (-8)\r\nseeds have a straight embryo and very slight endosperm (Fig. 433).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 430–433.--_Linum usitatissimum._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 430.--The Flax plant.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 431.--_A_ Flower after removal of sepals and petals; _m_\r\n  petal-stamens reduced to teeth. _B_ Longitudinal section of\r\n  ovary. _C_ Transverse section of capsule.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 432.--Capsule (nat. size).\r\n\r\n  Fig. 433.--Transverse and longitudinal section of seed: _bl_ the\r\n  cotyledons; _k_ the plumule; _R_ the radicle; _fr_ the endosperm;\r\n  _sk_ the testa.]\r\n\r\n_Linum_ (Flax) has 5-merous flowers. ~The main axis terminates in a\r\nflower; and the succeeding branching is cymose, or unipared scorpioid\r\nbranching by unilateral development, and the flowers in consequence of\r\nthe vigorous sympodial development of the lateral axis (and also by the\r\nleaves being displaced and pushed aside), assume a position apparently\r\nlateral (_i.e._ racemose) without bracts; each branch of the sympodium\r\ngenerally has 2 leaves. The testa is shining and smooth when dry, but\r\nits external cellular layer becomes mucilaginous in water.~--_Radiola_\r\nhas a 4-merous flower. It is a small herb with opposite leaves, and\r\nregular, dichasial branching.\r\n\r\n   The anthers and stigmas in _L. catharticum_ and _usitatissimum_\r\n   develop simultaneously, and cross-pollination as well as\r\n   self-pollination takes place. _L. grandiflorum_, _perenne_,\r\n   and others, are dimorphic (short-and long-styled). There are 5\r\n   nectaries outside the stamens.\r\n\r\n   130 species; _Linum_ and _Radiola_ are native genera.--_L.\r\n   usitatissimum_ is extensively cultivated in Europe (especially\r\n   in Russia and Belgium), N. America and elsewhere (its home no\r\n   doubt being Asia), partly on account of the oil (linseed oil)\r\n   which is extracted from the seeds, and partly on account of\r\n   the bast of the stem, which has very thick-walled cells. The\r\n   seeds and oil are OFFICINAL. The species cultivated in ancient\r\n   times was _L. angustifolium_. Several species are cultivated as\r\n   ornamental plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Geraniaceæ.= The majority are herbs with dichasial branching,\r\nand scattered or opposite, stalked, _palminerved_ (rarely penninerved)\r\nleaves with small _stipules_. The flowers are regular (except\r\n_Pelargonium_) and 5-merous, with 10 or 5 stamens, which are slightly\r\nunited at the base. Nectaries alternate with the corolla-stamens.\r\nThe ovary is most frequently 5-locular, deeply 5-grooved, and bears\r\n1 _well developed style_ (“beak”), which towards the apex divides\r\ninto 5 branches bearing stigmas; ovules 1 in each loculus, pendulous\r\nor ascending. _The 5 carpels become detached from one another when\r\nripe_, and bend or _roll back_ (Fig. 434) or become _spirally twisted_\r\nin the upper “beak-like” part (Figs. 435, 436), whilst a _central\r\ncolumn_ (septal column) persists; each carpel, in consequence, remains\r\neither closed, and the fruit is a 5-merous _schizocarp_ whose nut-like\r\nlower portion, containing the seed, is forced into the ground, thus\r\nburying the seed by the movements of the spirally-twisted, hygroscopic\r\n“beak” (Figs. 435, 436); or it opens along the ventral suture, so\r\nthat the seeds may fall out, and it is then a 5-valved _capsule_,\r\nwith septicidal dehiscence (Fig. 434) and the rolling up often takes\r\nplace so suddenly and violently that the seeds are shot out to\r\nconsiderable distances. The embryo is usually green and _curved_, and\r\nthe _cotyledons are folded_; endosperm is wanting.\r\n\r\n_Geranium_ (Crane’s-bill) has 5 + 5 stamens,and a septicidal capsule;\r\nthe carpels most frequently remain suspended from the apex of the\r\ncolumn (Fig. 434). The leaves are most frequently palminerved. The\r\nflowers are situated solitarily or 2 together (2-flowered scorpioid\r\ncyme).--_Erodium_ (Stork’s-bill); inflorescence a many-flowered\r\nunipared scorpioid cyme, stamens 5 + 0 (petal-stamens are wanting), and\r\nfruit a schizocarp whose carpels become detached; their beaks are hairy\r\non the internal surface and _twist themselves spirally_ (Fig. 436).\r\nThe umbellate inflorescences are composed of multiflowered scorpioid\r\ncymes. The leaves are often penninerved.--~The most primitive type is\r\nrepresented by _Biebersteinia_: S5, P5, A5 + 5, G5 (ovaries _free_,\r\nand styles united above); fruit 5 small nuts. The most advanced type\r\nis _Pelargonium_, which has _zygomorphic_ flowers, the posterior sepal\r\nbeing prolonged into a spur which becomes adnate to the peduncle;\r\nthe petals are unequal in size; some of the petal-stamens are often\r\nwanting. (_Erodium_ may be slightly zygomorphic).~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 434.--_Geranium sanguineum._ Fruit (3/1).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 435.--_Pelargonium._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 436.--_Erodium cicutarium_, detached carpel.]\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. The large-flowered _Geranium_-species are\r\n   protandrous, _e.g. G. pratense_ (one whorl of stamens opens\r\n   first, and then the other, and succeeding these the stigmas,\r\n   after shedding the pollen the stamens bend outwards); the\r\n   small-flowered are also adapted, with various modifications,\r\n   for self-pollination.--470 species; moderately hot climates,\r\n   especially S. Africa.--Several _Pelargonium_-species, with\r\n   numerous varieties, are ornamental plants (from S. Africa).\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Tropæolaceæ.= Herbaceous, juicy plants which have scattered,\r\nlong-stalked, peltate leaves without stipules, and often climb by their\r\nsensitive petioles. The flowers are situated singly in the axils of the\r\nfoliage-leaves on long stalks, and are _zygomorphic_, the receptacle\r\nunder the posterior sepal being prolonged _into a spur_; there are also\r\ndifferences between the posterior and anterior petals, the 2 posterior\r\npetals situated on the border of the spur being _perigynous_, and the\r\nedge of the anterior petals adjoining the claw fringed. After the 5\r\nsepals (which are more or less coloured) and the 5 petals, follow 8\r\n_stamens_ (as the 2 median ones are suppressed, one from each whorl)\r\nand a gynœceum formed of 3 carpels; in each of the 3 loculi of the\r\n3-grooved ovary is 1 ovule. The fruit is a _schizocarp_ and divides\r\ninto 3 1-seeded, _drupe-like_ fruitlets, which do not (as in the\r\nGeraniaceæ) leave any pronounced column between them. Endosperm is\r\nwanting. The cotyledons are thick and sometimes slightly coalescent.\r\n~Tubers often occur.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 437.--Diagram of _Tropæolum_: _sp_, spur.]\r\n\r\n_Tropæolum._--About 40 species; all from America.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION.--The spur is the receptacle for the nectar; the\r\n   flowers are protandrous; the anthers open first, and one by\r\n   one take up a position in front of the entrance to the spur,\r\n   resuming their original position when the pollen is shed; the\r\n   stigma finally takes their place after the filaments have bent\r\n   backwards.--These plants have an acrid taste (hence the name\r\n   “Nasturtium,” “Indian Cress”), on which account the flower-buds\r\n   and young fruits of _T. majus_ are used as capers. Some species\r\n   are ornamental plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Balsaminaceæ.= Herbaceous, chiefly annual plants with\r\njuicy, brittle stems, so transparent that the vascular bundles may be\r\ndistinctly seen. The leaves are simple, usually scattered, penninerved\r\nand dentate; stipules are wanting, but sometimes large glands are\r\npresent in their place at the base of the petioles. The flowers are\r\nstrongly zygomorphic; of their five 5-merous whorls the petal-stamens\r\nare suppressed (S5, P5, A5 + 0, G5); the sepals are _coloured_, the\r\n2 _anterior ones_ (Fig. 438 _3_, _5_) _are very small_ or entirely\r\nsuppressed, _the posterior one_ is very large and _elongated into a\r\nspur_, and the 2 lateral ones pushed forward; sometimes the weight\r\nof the spur turns the flower completely round, so that the posterior\r\nleaves assume an anterior position; apparently only 3 petals, since\r\nthe lateral and the posterior petals become united in pairs, and\r\nthe anterior is larger and differently shaped; the 5 stamens have\r\nvery short and thick filaments united at the base, and their anthers\r\nfinally adhere together and remain in this condition, covering over\r\nthe gynœceum; the filaments ultimately rupture at the base, and the\r\nentire anthers are raised on the apex of the gynœceum as it grows\r\nup. The gynœceum has a _sessile stigma_ and a 5-locular ovary. The\r\nfruit is a capsule which, on maturity, opens suddenly when irritated,\r\ndividing into valves from the base upwards, and as the 5 valves roll\r\nup elastically, the seeds are shot out on all sides to considerable\r\ndistances; a central column persists (Fig. 439). The embryo is\r\nstraight, and without endosperm.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 438.--Diagram of _Impatiens glanduligera_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 439.--Fruit of _Impatiens_.]\r\n\r\n   _Impatiens_; in Europe only _I. noli-me-tangere_. 225 species;\r\n   especially from Asia. Several species have two kinds of flowers:\r\n   small, cleistogamic, but fertile; and large, coloured flowers,\r\n   which in _I. balsamine_ (ornamental plant, E. Ind.) are\r\n   protandrous and pollinated by hive-and humble-bees, as they suck\r\n   the honey from the spur.\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Limnanthaceæ.= The flowers are regular and differ\r\n   from all the other orders in the family by having the carpels\r\n   not in front of the petals, but _in front of the sepals_\r\n   (which are _valvate_), and further, the loculi are nearly\r\n   _free individually_, but with a _common gynobasic_ style;\r\n   the ovules are _ascending_ and _apotropous_ (anatropous with\r\n   ventral raphe). The fruit is a schizocarp, with nut-like\r\n   cocci.--_Limnanthes_ (4 species; N. Am.) perhaps belongs to\r\n   another family.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Humiriaceæ.= Trees and shrubs; about 20 species; Trop.\r\n   Am.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 13. =Columniferæ.=\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics of the orders belonging to this family are\r\nthe ☿, regular, generally 5-merous, _hypogynous_ flowers with 5-merous\r\n_calyx_, sepals united and _valvate_ in the bud; petals 5, free (often\r\n_twisted_ in the bud); stamens ∞ _e.g._: 10, in two whorls, but one of\r\nthese is more or less suppressed, often altogether wanting, or replaced\r\nby 5 staminodes, while _the other_ (inner whorl) _is generally divided\r\nmore or less deeply_ into a large number of anther-bearing filaments.\r\nThe filaments too (except _Tiliaceæ_) are _united into a tube_, which,\r\nespecially in the _Malvaceæ_, forms a long column in the centre of\r\nthe flower, surrounding the gynœceum (Figs. 445, 448); in this case,\r\nwhich is the most pronounced, the filaments are united into one bundle\r\n(_monadelphous_), in other instances, _polyadelphous_. The number of\r\ncarpels varies greatly (2 to about 50), but they are nearly always\r\nunited and form a syncarpous multilocular gynœceum.--The vegetative\r\ncharacters also closely agree, the leaves _are always scattered and\r\ngenerally stipulate_; all the green portions very often bear _stellate\r\nhairs_, and the bark in all the 3 orders is _rich in tough bast_.\r\nMucilage is often present in cells or passages.--This family is\r\nconnected with the _Ternstrœmiaceæ_, from which it is very hard to draw\r\na sharp line of demarcation, and it is also allied to the _Cistaceæ_\r\nand to the _Gruinales_.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Sterculiaceæ= (including Buettneriaceæ). This is, no\r\ndoubt, the least modified order, and one in which the stamens occur\r\nundivided. Obdiplostemonous. The 10 stamens in two whorls are most\r\nfrequently united at the base into a short tube, and have _4-locular,\r\nextrorse_ anthers. The calyx-stamens are nearly always simple,\r\ntooth-like staminodes, situated on the edge of the tube, or are\r\nentirely suppressed. The same relation is found, for instance, in the\r\nAmpelidaceæ and Rhamnaceæ, namely _5 stamens in front of the 5 petals_;\r\nnot infrequently the 5 stamens are doubled (Fig. 441). Unisexual\r\nflowers are found in _Sterculia_, _Cola_, _Heritiera_. The corolla\r\nis often wanting, or developed in an unusual manner. Each loculus of\r\nthe ovary (generally 5) always contains more than one ovule. Fruit a\r\ncapsule. Androgynophore often present (_Helicteres_; _Sterculia_, etc.).\r\n\r\n   _Hermannia_, _Mahernia_, _Melochia_, etc., have flat petals\r\n   with twisted æstivation; 5 undivided stamens, which usually\r\n   are but slightly united at the base, and most frequently,\r\n   without staminodes. _Thomasia_; _Helicteres_; _Sterculia_\r\n   (free follicles).--_Theobroma_, _Rulingia_, _Buettneria_,\r\n   _Commersonia_, _Guazuma_, etc., have petals concave at the\r\n   base, and terminating in a limb abruptly bent back, and at the\r\n   boundary between them most frequently ligular outgrowths, as in\r\n   certain genera of the Caryophyllaceæ; stamens 5–15–∞, anthers\r\n   at the edge of a short tube and 5 linear staminodes (Fig.\r\n   441).--The Cocoa-tree (_Theobroma_), (Fig. 440) bears large,\r\n   reddish-yellow, berry-like fruits, resembling short cucumbers,\r\n   but ultimately becoming leathery to woody; in each of the 5\r\n   loculi are 2 (apparently only 1) rows of horizontal, oily seeds,\r\n   as large as almonds. Cotyledons large, thick, and irregularly\r\n   folded. Endosperm absent (Fig. 442).\r\n\r\n   49 genera, with about 750 species; almost entirely confined\r\n   to the Tropics; none in Europe or in N. Asia.--The seeds\r\n   of the Cocoa-tree (_T. cacao_, _bicolor_, _glaucum_, etc.,\r\n   natives of Trop. Am., especially north of the Equator) are\r\n   used for chocolate and are also _officinal_ (“Cocoa-beans,”\r\n   “Cocoa-butter,” “Oil of Theobroma”). Theobromine. _Cola\r\n   acuminata_, Africa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 440.--_Theobroma cacao._ Branch with flowers\r\n  and fruits (⅙).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 441–442.--_Theobroma cacao._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 441.--Diagram of the flower: _st_ barren stamens.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 442.--_B_ Seed in transverse section: _n_ hilum. _A_ Embryo\r\n  after the removal of one of the cotyledons.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Tiliaceæ.= This differs from the other orders of the\r\nColumniferæ chiefly in the stamens being entirely _free_ from each\r\nother, and also _divided_ into many filaments, _as far as the base_,\r\nor at all events very far down, so that the _flower appears to have\r\nnumerous stamens_ or to be _slightly_ polyadelphous (Fig. 443); in\r\naddition to this, it may be observed that the anthers are _4-locular_\r\nand _introrse_. In _Luehea_ the groups of stamens alternate with the\r\npetals. In a few genera (_Corchorus_, _Triumfetta_) 10 free and single\r\nstamens are found in 2 whorls; but, in the majority, groups of free\r\nstamens in separate bundles. The stamens are more or less united\r\nin _Apeiba, Luehea_. Style simple. Ovary 2-locular. The ovules are\r\npendulous; raphe turned inwards. The calyx readily falls off; the\r\næstivation of the entirely free petals is slightly imbricate (_not\r\ntwisted_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 443.--Inflorescence of _Tilia_, with\r\n  its winged bracteole (_h_); _a_, _a_ axis of the shoot; the\r\n  vegetative bud is seen between the inflorescence and the axis of\r\n  the shoot; _b_ petiole of foliage-leaf.]\r\n\r\n_Tilia_ (Figs. 443, 444). Calyx and corolla 5-merous; the 5 staminal\r\nleaves (opposite the petals) divided as far as the base into a large\r\nnumber of stamens which are free or united into groups; gynœceum with\r\n5 loculi in the ovary (opposite the sepals); there are 2 ovules in\r\neach loculus, though the ovary ripens into a 1-seeded nut, which is\r\nnot detached from the axis of the inflorescence, but is carried away\r\nby the wind, whirling round and round, its large-winged bracteole\r\nserving as a parachute (Fig. 443).--~Only trees, with alternate,\r\nobliquely heart-shaped and dentate leaves; stellate hairs, as in the\r\nother Columniferæ, are often present. The terminal bud of the branch\r\nalways fails to develop, and the growth is then continued sympodially\r\nby the uppermost axillary buds. The INFLORESCENCE (Figs. 443, 444) is\r\na 3–7-flowered dichasium (Fig. 444 _t_, _d_, _e_), which is developed\r\nin the axil of a foliage-leaf (Fig. 444). The first of its 2 bracteoles\r\n(_a_) is large, thin, leaf-like, and united with the inflorescence,\r\nthe lower portion of which forms a broad wing, its so-called “bract”;\r\nthe second bracteole (_b_), on the other hand, remains scale-like,\r\nand supports a winter foliage-bud covered with bud-scales which thus\r\nis situated at the base of the inflorescence, and is a bud of the\r\n2nd order, in relation to the vegetative shoot. This bud is always\r\nfound beneath the inflorescence on the branch placed horizontally,\r\nand the winged bracteole is always found above it, a relation which\r\nis connected with the fact that the 2 rows of shoots on the sides\r\nof a branch are _antidromous_ with regard to each other.--The\r\ndichasium itself (Fig. 444) terminates with the flower (_t_); it has\r\n3 floral-leaves (_c_, _d_, _e_), which soon fall off; _c_ is barren:\r\nthe other two bear flowers, or few-flowered dichasia, or unipared\r\nscorpioid cymes (indicated in the figure).--The foliage-leaves are\r\nfolded in the bud upon the median line (1, 2, 3 in Fig. 444 are\r\nfoliage-leaves with their 2 stipules), the inner half is broader than\r\nthe outer, and after unfolding is turned away from the mother-axis (the\r\nposition of the new inflorescences and vegetative buds is indicated in\r\ntheir axils on the figure).--The cotyledons on germination appear above\r\nthe ground as large, _lobed_ leaves.~\r\n\r\n   Of the other genera some have a bell-shaped, gamosepalous\r\n   calyx, some have no corolla, the anthers of some open at the\r\n   apex (_Aristotelia_, _Elæocarpus_, etc.), the majority have\r\n   a capsule, some have berries, or drupes, some separate into\r\n   fruitlets, etc.--_Corchorus_, _Triumfetta_ (nut, with hooked\r\n   bristles), _Luehea_, _Apeiba_, etc. _Sparmannia_ is an African\r\n   genus; 4-merous flowers; fruit a warted capsule; filaments\r\n   numerous and sensitive to touch, the external ones are without\r\n   anthers and moniliform above. The plant is covered with numerous\r\n   soft and stellate hairs, and at the apex of the branches bears\r\n   several cymose umbels.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 444.--Diagram of the inflorescence of _Tilia_\r\n  and the vegetative bud; the position of the leaves is indicated,\r\n  and also the position of the inflorescences, which develop from\r\n  their axils in the following year.]\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION in _Tilia_ is effected by insects, especially\r\n   bees and Diptera, which swarm round the tree tops, allured\r\n   by the numerous strongly-scented flowers and the easily\r\n   accessible honey (formed in the hollow sepals). As the flowers\r\n   are pendulous, the nectar is protected from ruin; and, in\r\n   addition, the inflorescence is more or less concealed beneath\r\n   the foliage-leaf. Self-pollination is impossible, on account of\r\n   protandry.--About 470 species (nearly all trees and shrubs);\r\n   especially in the Tropics, only a few being found in the\r\n   temperate, none in the polar regions, or in high mountainous\r\n   districts.--The inflorescence of the native species of _Tilia_\r\n   is medicinal. The wood is used for charcoal.--The majority are\r\n   used for timber, and for the sake of the bast (“Bast,” “Jute,”\r\n   the bast of _Corchorus textilis_, _Luehea_, and others).\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Malvaceæ= (=Mallows=). The plants are easily recognised by\r\nthe scattered, simple, _palminerved_, most frequently lobed, stipulate\r\n_leaves_, folded in the bud; the perfect, regular, hypogynous flowers,\r\nwith _gamosepalous_, persistent, 5-merous calyx with _valvate_\r\næstivation; the 5 _petals twisted_ in the bud and united with one\r\nanother at the base, and by the 5 _apparently numerous stamens_ (Figs.\r\n445, 448), with the filaments _united into a tube_, with _reniform\r\nbilocular anthers_ opening by a crescentic slit (in 2 valves).\r\nCarpels 3–∞ united into one gynœceum; the _embryo is curved and the\r\ncotyledons are folded_ (Figs. 447, 451); endosperm scanty, often\r\nmucilaginous.--Most of the plants belonging to this order are herbs,\r\noften closely studded with _stellate hairs_. The leaves are most\r\nfrequently palmatifid or palmatisect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 445.--Longitudinal section through the flower\r\n  of _Malva silvestris_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 446.--Diagram of _Althæa rosea_: _i_ the\r\n  epicalyx.]\r\n\r\n   An _epicalyx_ is often found formed by _floral-leaves_ placed\r\n   close beneath the calyx, in some 3, in others several. The\r\n   median sepal is posterior in the species without epicalyx,\r\n   often anterior in those which have an epicalyx.--The petals are\r\n   _twisted either to the right or to the left_ in accordance with\r\n   the spiral of the calyx; they are most frequently oblique, as\r\n   in the other plants with twisted corollas, so that the portion\r\n   covered in the æstivation is the most developed. The corolla\r\n   drops off as a whole, united with the staminal tube.--Only\r\n   the 5 petal-stamens are developed, but they are divided into\r\n   a number of stamens, placed in 2 rows, and provided only with\r\n   _half_-anthers (leaf-segments, see Fig. 446; the sepal-stamens\r\n   are completely suppressed); these 5 staminal leaves are then\r\n   united into a tube, frequently 5-dentate at the top, and\r\n   bearing the anthers on its external side. The pollen-grains\r\n   are specially large, spherical and spiny. There are from 3 to\r\n   about 50 carpels united into one gynœceum and placed round the\r\n   summit of the axis which most frequently projects between them.\r\n   There is only 1 style, which is generally divided into as many\r\n   stigma-bearing branches as there are carpels (Figs. 445, 448).\r\n   The fruit is a schizocarp or capsule. Endosperm (Figs. 447 A,\r\n   451) scanty, often mucilaginous round the _embryo_, which is\r\n   rich in oil.\r\n\r\n   The order is the most advanced type of Columniferæ; it stands\r\n   especially near to the Sterculiaceæ, but is separated from these\r\n   and from the Tiliaceæ, among other characters, by its 2-locular\r\n   (ultimately 1-chambered) anthers.\r\n\r\nThe sub-orders may be arranged as follows:--\r\n\r\nI. Carpels in one whorl.\r\n\r\n=A.= =The fruit a capsule=, ~most frequently with loculicidal\r\ndehiscence, and many seeds in each loculus~.\r\n\r\n=1.= GOSSYPIEÆ. The staminal-column is naked at the apex, blunted, or\r\n5-dentate.--_Gossypium_ (the Cotton plant) has an epicalyx of 3 large\r\novate-cordate leaves, an almost entire, low and compressed calyx.\r\nSolitary flowers. Large, most frequently yellow, corollas. A 3–5-valved\r\ncapsule with many spherical seeds. “Cotton” is the seed-hairs developed\r\nupon the entire surface of the seeds (Fig. 447), and consists of long,\r\n1-cellular hairs, filled with air (and therefore white); these are\r\nthin-walled, with a large lumen, and during drying twist spirally,\r\nand come together more or less in the form of bands. They consist\r\nof cellulose, and have a cuticle.--_Hibiscus_ has several, most\r\nfrequently narrow, epicalyx-leaves, a distinct 5-toothed or 5-partite\r\ncalyx.--_Abutilon_; _Modiola_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 447.--_A_ Seed of _Gossypium_ with hairs; _B_\r\n  the same in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n   =2.= BOMBACEÆ. The staminal tube is more or less deeply cleft\r\n   into bundles, sometimes almost to the base; pollen smooth,\r\n   style simple with capitate, lobed stigma. Almost all plants\r\n   belonging to this group are trees, and in many instances have\r\n   large barrel-shaped stems, that is, swollen in the centre, and\r\n   sometimes covered with large warts. The wood is exceptionally\r\n   light and soft. The flowers are often enormously large, and have\r\n   beautiful petals; in some they unfold before the leaves. The\r\n   capsule-wall is sometimes closely covered on its inner service\r\n   with long, silky, woolly hairs, while the seeds themselves\r\n   are generally without hairs. These hairs, however, on account\r\n   of their brittle nature, cannot be used like those of the\r\n   Cotton-plant. Digitate leaves are found in the _Baobab-tree_\r\n   (_Adansonia_) from Africa, noted for its enormously thick, but\r\n   short stem, and in the American _Silk-cotton trees_ (_Bombax_,\r\n   _Eriodendron_, _Chorisia_). _Ochroma_, _Cheirostemon_, _Durio_,\r\n   and others also belong to this group. _Durio_ is noted for its\r\n   delicious fruits, which have a most unpleasant smell.\r\n\r\n   [_Bombax malabaricum_ is diplostemonous; the five sepal-stamens\r\n   repeatedly branch, and the filaments bear unilocular anthers;\r\n   the five petal-stamens bear bilocular anthers.]\r\n\r\n=B.= =Schizocarps=, with 1-seeded fruitlets, most frequently nut-like\r\nand reniform (Figs. 449, 451).\r\n\r\n=3.= MALVEÆ, MALLOW GROUP. The carpels are arranged in one whorl\r\n(Fig. 449); the number of stylar-branches equals that of the\r\ncarpels; fruitlets 1-seeded, reniform, indehiscent, but detaching\r\nthemselves from one another and from the persistent central column\r\n(Figs. 450, 451).--~_Malva_ has an _epicalyx of 3 free leaves_. ~A\r\nflower with 2 suppressed bracteoles is situated in the axil of the\r\nfoliage-leaves; one of these supports a homodromous foliage-shoot\r\nwhich forms a repetition of the main axis, the other an antidromous\r\nflower which continues the branching as a unipared scorpioid\r\ncyme.~--_Althæa_, Rose Mallow, has an _epicalyx of 6–9 leaves united at\r\nthe base_.--~_Lavatera_, _Sida_, _Anoda_, _Bastardia_, etc., have no\r\nepicalyx.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 448–451.--_Malva silvestris._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 448.--The flower after removal of the\r\n  perianth (5/1).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 449.--The fruit (5/1).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 450.--A fruitlet (5/1).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 451.--The same in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n   =4.= URENEÆ, have always only 5 carpels arranged in 1 whorl,\r\n   with 1 ovule in each loculus, and the fruit a schizocarp,\r\n   generally with nut-like fruitlets provided with warts and\r\n   hooks; but in some they dehisce by 2 valves (capsule). They\r\n   differ principally from the other groups _in having twice as\r\n   many stylar-branches as carpels_; the staminal tube is naked at\r\n   the point, blunt or 5 toothed.--The genera _Urena_, _Pavonia_,\r\n   _Malachra_, _Malvaviscus_ (with _berry-like fruits_) belong to\r\n   this group.\r\n\r\nII. Carpels arranged in a spherical head in five groups opposite to the\r\npetals.\r\n\r\n   =5.= MALOPEÆ, differ from all the others in having a large\r\n   number of fruitlets arranged irregularly in a round head, and\r\n   separating considerably from each other even before maturity;\r\n   there is, however, only 1 style, divided into a corresponding\r\n   number of branches (this condition may be considered to have\r\n   arisen from the branching [dédoublement] of 5 _carpels_).\r\n   _Malope_ has 3 large, heart-shaped (_Kitaibelia_ 6–9)\r\n   epicalyx-leaves, united at the base. _Palava_ has no epicalyx.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. The majority have protandrous flowers, and are\r\n   pollinated by insects. Between the basal portions of the 5\r\n   petals, there are 5 nectaries, protected from the rain by\r\n   hairs, _e.g._ in _Malva silvestris_. When the flower first\r\n   opens the numerous anthers occupy the centre of the flower, and\r\n   the still undeveloped stigmas are concealed in the staminal\r\n   tube; in the next stage the anthers are withered and empty,\r\n   and the stigmas protrude and assume their places (Fig. 452).\r\n   The large-flowered forms, it appears, are pollinated only by\r\n   insects; but self-pollination takes place in small-flowered\r\n   forms, as, for example, in _Malva rotundifolia_, in which the\r\n   stylar-branches, twisting themselves, place the stigmas in\r\n   between the undeveloped anthers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 452.--_Anoda hastata_: _a_ the bud just\r\n  opened, the stigmas are concealed by the anthers; _b_ fully\r\n  opened flower in ♂-stage; the upper stamens are developed first,\r\n  and then the others in descending order; the stylar-branches\r\n  are now visible, and lie bent back on the staminal column; _c_\r\n  all the stamens project upwards, and all the anthers are open,\r\n  but the stylar-branches are still bent back; d the anthers are\r\n  emptied and the filaments shrunk together, but the styles have\r\n  now straightened themselves upwards, and the stigmas are in the\r\n  receptive condition.]\r\n\r\n   DISTRIBUTION. 800 species (63 genera), most of which are\r\n   natives of the Tropics, especially America. _Althæa_ and some\r\n   of the species of _Malva_ are natives of the temperate regions\r\n   of the Old World, the latter is also found in North America.\r\n   _Gossypium_ is tropical, no doubt especially Asiatic (_G.\r\n   herbaceum_ from India; _G. arboreum_ from Upper Egypt). Cotton\r\n   was introduced into Greece in the time of Herodotus, and was\r\n   cultivated in America before the arrival of the Europeans.\r\n\r\n   USES. Pungent and poisonous properties are entirely wanting;\r\n   _mucilage_, on the other hand, is found in abundance in all\r\n   parts of the plant. Medicinal: the root of _Althæa officinalis_,\r\n   leaves and flowers of _Malva_-species (_M. silvestris vulgaris_\r\n   and _borealis_) and _Gossypium_.--The seeds contain a large\r\n   quantity of _fatty oil_, which is in some cases extracted\r\n   (Cotton-seeds and others). _The seed-hairs of the Cotton\r\n   plant_ are the most important product of the order. The\r\n   cultivated forms of Cotton belong to several species: _G.\r\n   barbadense_, _herbaceum_, _religiosum_, _arboreum_ (Nankin),\r\n   _hirsutum_, and others. According to other botanists, there\r\n   are only 3 species. _Bast_ is obtained from _e.g. Hibiscus\r\n   cannabinus_ (Gambo-hemp, Africa), _Paritium tiliaceum_ and\r\n   _Sida retusa_. The fruits of certain species of _Hibiscus_\r\n   (_e.g. H. esculentus_, from Tropical Africa) are used in\r\n   tropical countries as a vegetable before they are ripe.--_The\r\n   colouring matter_ in the flowers of _Althæa rosea_, var.\r\n   _nigra_, is used for colouring wines, and hence is extensively\r\n   cultivated in certain parts of Europe.--_Ethereal oils and\r\n   sweet-scented flowers_ are rare; but several species possess\r\n   a peculiar musk-like odour (_Malva moschata_, _Hibiscus\r\n   abelmoschus_, and others).--Many are cultivated as _ornamental\r\n   plants_ on account of the large flowers, _e.g._ Hollyhock (_A.\r\n   rosea_, etc.), _Lavatera trimestris_, _Malope grandiflora_ and\r\n   _trifida_, _Malva_-species, _Hibiscus rosa sinensis_, _syriaca_;\r\n   _Sphæralcea_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 14. =Tricoccæ.=\r\n\r\nThe very large order _Euphorbiaceæ_ and three smaller ones belong to\r\nthis family. They have in common: _unisexual_, hypogynous, frequently\r\nregular flowers, the perianth most frequently single, rarely double, or\r\nentirely wanting; there is such a great variety in the structure and\r\nparts of the flower that one only can be cited as the _rule_: viz. the\r\nsimple gynœceum composed of 3 carpels forming a 3-locular ovary, which\r\nis frequently more or less deeply grooved (hence the name, _Tricoccæ_);\r\nin the inner angles of the loculi are found 1 or 2 (never several)\r\npendulous (except _Empetraceæ_), anatropous ovules, with upward and\r\noutwardly turned, frequently swollen, micropyle (Fig. 455). The seed\r\nmost frequently has a large endosperm and a straight embryo (Figs.\r\n455 _B_, 464).--~The family approaches the nearest to the Gruinales\r\nand Columniferæ; it may perhaps be regarded as an offshoot from the\r\nSterculiaceæ.~\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Euphorbiaceæ.= Flowers unisexual. In each of the loculi of\r\nthe ovary, generally 3, there are 1 or 2 pendulous ovules with upward\r\nand outwardly turned micropyle. The placenta protrudes above the ovules\r\n(Figs. 454, 461 _B_). On the ripening of the capsule the 3 carpels\r\nseparate septicidally, frequently with great violence, ejecting the\r\nseeds and leaving a central column. Endosperm copious.--For the rest,\r\nthe flowers present all stages, from genera with calyx and corolla,\r\nto those which are the most reduced in Nature, namely the naked,\r\n1-stamened flowers of _Euphorbia_.\r\n\r\nThe same variety which is found in the flower is also present in the\r\nvegetative parts. Some are herbs, as our Spurges, others are shrubs\r\nand trees; some African _Euphorbia_-species even resemble the habit\r\nof a Cactus. Leaf-like branches with rudimentary leaves are found in\r\n_Phyllanthus_ (sub-genus _Xylophylla_) (Fig. 456). The leaves are\r\nscattered or opposite, often stipulate; they are nearly always simple.\r\nLarge, highly-branched cells containing a great quantity of pungent\r\nlatex are found in many, and watery juice in others. Glands and\r\nglandular hairs are general.--Only a few genera can be considered in\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the most perfect flowers (which partly reproduce\r\nthe Geraniaceous type) may be mentioned, _Croton_, _Manihot_, and\r\n_Jatropha_; 5 sepals, 5 petals, sometimes gamopetalous, andrœcium\r\ndiplostemonous, or many-stamened, often monodelphous.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 453–455.--_Ricinus communis._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 453.--♂-flower (magnified).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 454.--♀-flower in longitudinal section.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 455.--_A_ seed entire; _B_ in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n_Ricinus_ (Castor-oil) (Figs. 453–455); monœcious; the ♂-flowers,\r\nsituated in the lower portion of the inflorescence, have 5\r\nperianth-leaves and a large number of branched stamens; the ♀-flower\r\nhas 3–5 perianth-leaves; 3 bifid styles. Leaves peltate, palmately\r\nlobed. The seeds (Fig. 455) contain an abundance of fatty oil and\r\nlarge aleurone grains.--_Mercurialis_ (Mercury): the perianth is most\r\nfrequently 3-merous; in the ♂-flowers 9–12 stamens; in the ♀-flowers\r\nmost frequently a _2-locular_ gynœceum.--_Phyllanthus_: Pr3 + 3, A3,\r\nunited in some and forming a column in the centre of the flower (Figs.\r\n457, 458); _Xylophylla_ is a section of this genus.-- _Hura crepitans_\r\n(Sand-box tree) has a many-carpellate gynœceum, which separates with\r\ngreat violence when ripe.--A drupe is found in _Hippomane mancinella_\r\n(the Mancinil-tree, W. Ind.)--_Alchornea (Coelebogyne) ilicifolia_ is\r\nwell known on account of its “parthenogenesis”; only the ♀-plant has\r\nbeen introduced into Europe, but it nevertheless produces seeds capable\r\nof germination; these have generally several embryos.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 456–458.--_Phyllanthus (Xylophylla)\r\n  angustifolius._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 456.--Leaf-like branch with flowers (nat. size).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 457.--♂-flower; and FIG. 458, ♀-flower (mag.).]\r\n\r\n_Euphorbia_ (Spurge) has the most reduced flowers, which are borne\r\nin a very complicated inflorescence. Each ♂-flower (Fig. 460 _B_) is\r\nnaked, and consists of one stamen only (terminal on the axis). In the\r\nclosely allied genus _Anthostema_, a small perianth is situated at\r\nthe place where, in _Euphorbia_, there is a joint in the “filament,”\r\n(Fig. 461 _A_). The ♀-flowers (Fig. 460) are naked, with a 3-locular\r\novary and 3 bifid styles. (_Anthostema_ has a distinct perianth (Fig.\r\n461 _B_); in a few Euphorbias traces of a perianth are present).\r\nIn _Euphorbia_ the ♂-and ♀-flowers are grouped into flower-like\r\ninflorescences termed “cyathia.” Each cyathium consists of a centrally\r\nplaced ♀-flower which is first developed, surrounded by 5 groups of\r\n♂-flowers (stamens) placed in a zig-zag, with a centrifugal order\r\nof development (Figs. 459, 460 _B_), that is, in unipared scorpioid\r\ncymes; these flowers are surrounded by an _involucre_ of 5 leaves\r\nunited into a _bell-shaped structure_ (Fig. 459, 1–5) (resembling a\r\ncalyx); on its edge are placed 4, generally crescent-like, yellow\r\nglands, one in each of the intervals, except one, between the lobes of\r\nthe involucre (shaded in Fig. 459; see also Fig. 460 _A_). Scale-like\r\nthin structures (floral-leaves?) are situated between the ♂-flowers.\r\nThe ♀-flower has a long stalk, and finally bends down on one side,\r\nnamely to the place on the edge of the involucre where the gland is not\r\ndeveloped. These cyathia are again arranged in an inflorescence which\r\ncommences as a 3–5-rayed umbellate cyme (pleiochasium), the branches\r\nof which ramify dichasially and finally as scorpioid cymes.--Latex,\r\nwith peculiar-shaped starch-grains, is found in laticiferous _cells_\r\n(especially in the Cactus-like, leafless species.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 459.--Diagram of an inflorescence (cyathium)\r\n  of _Euphorbia_ with 3 floral-leaves, _m_, _n_, _o_, supporting\r\n  other cyathia which are subtended by 2 floral-leaves (bracteoles;\r\n  _m_, _n_). 1–5, the involucral leaves in their order of\r\n  development; the shaded portions are the crescentic glands.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 460.--_Euphorbia lathyris_: _A_ an (entire)\r\n  inflorescence (cyathium); _B_ the same after the removal of the\r\n  involucre.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 461.--_Anthostema_: ♂- (_A_) and ♀-(_B_)\r\n  flowers; _p_ the perianth; _ar_ the node; _o_ the ovule.]\r\n\r\n   205 genera; more than 3,000 species; especially in the\r\n   Tropics.--Many are used on account of the oil, and of the\r\n   pungent (aperient, poisonous, anthelmintic, etc.) properties in\r\n   the latex or the seeds. OFFICINAL: “Cascarilla-bark” of _Croton\r\n   eluteria_; the fatty oil of the seeds of _Croton tiglium_\r\n   (Trop. Asia); “Castor oil” from _Ricinus communis_ (Africa,\r\n   and cultivated in all warm climates throughout the world);\r\n   the glandular hairs of _Mallotus philippinensis_ (“Kamala”);\r\n   this also yields a red dye. Gum “Euphorbium” is the hardened\r\n   (resinous) latex of the _Cactus_-like _Euphorbia resinifera_\r\n   (Morocco).--NUTRITIVE plants: _Manihot utilissima_ and other\r\n   species (Maniok, Am.). Their large, farinaceous roots form a\r\n   very important article of food in the Tropics (Cassava-flour,\r\n   Tapioca or Brazilian arrowroot). The fresh latex of the root in\r\n   some species is a powerful poison; but the poisonous properties\r\n   are diminished by roasting or cooking. _Caoutchouc_ is obtained\r\n   from _Siphonia elastica_ (Trop. S. Am.). The vegetable\r\n   tallow of the Chinese tallow-tree (_Stillingia sebifera_) is\r\n   used in large quantities in soap factories. An indigo-like\r\n   _dye_ is obtained from _Crozophora tinctoria_, and is also\r\n   found in _Mercurialis perennis_. Shellac is obtained from\r\n   _Aleurites laccifera_. ORNAMENTAL plants: _Acalypha_, _Croton_,\r\n   _Dalechampia_.--_Hippomane_ is poisonous.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Buxaceæ.= This order differs from the Euphorbiaceæ\r\n   in having the micropyle turned inwards; the ♂-flower has a\r\n   4-partite perianth and 4 stamens; the ♀-flower a 6-partite\r\n   perianth and 3 carpels. Capsule with loculicidal dehiscence,\r\n   the inner layer being detached elastically from the outer.--30\r\n   species. Shrubs without latex and with evergreen leaves.--_Buxus\r\n   sempervirens_ (Box) is an ornamental shrub (poisonous); it has a\r\n   very hard and valuable wood which is used for wood-engraving and\r\n   carving.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 462–464. _Callitriche stagnalis._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 462.--♂-flower with the 2 bracteoles and the solitary stamen.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 463.--♀-flower.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 464.--Longitudinal section of the ripe fruit.]\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Callitrichaceæ.= Aquatic plants, growing at the bottom\r\n   of shallow water, with opposite, simple, undivided, entire,\r\n   exstipulate leaves, which are generally crowded and form a\r\n   rosette in the apex of the branches. The flowers are unisexual\r\n   (monœcious) and borne singly in the leaf-axils; they have no\r\n   perianth, but are provided with two delicate bracteoles; the\r\n   ♂-flowers consist of only _1 terminal stamen_ (Fig. 462);\r\n   the ♀-flowers of a bicarpellate gynœceum (Fig. 463) which is\r\n   originally 2-locular, but later on becomes 4-locular, as in the\r\n   case of the gynœceum of the Labiatæ, by the formation of a false\r\n   partition-wall; in each loculus there is 1 pendulous ovule with\r\n   the micropyle turned outwards. Fruit a _4-partite schizocarp_\r\n   (Fig. 464). 25 species.--_Callitriche._\r\n\r\n   Order 4 (?). =Empetraceæ.= 4 species. _Empetrum_; _E. nigrum_\r\n   (Crowberry) is a heather-like, moorland, evergreen undershrub\r\n   with linear leaves, having a deep groove closed with hairs, on\r\n   the under side. The _erect ovules_ show the greatest deviation\r\n   from the Euphorbiaceæ. Diœcious (and ☿); S3, P3; in the\r\n   ♂-flower, 3 stamens; in the ♀-flower, a 6–9-locular ovary. Fruit\r\n   a _drupe_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 15. =Terebinthinæ.=\r\n\r\nThe diagram of the flower (Figs. 465–467) is the same as in the\r\nGruinales, namely S, P, A2 and G in whorls of 5 (less frequently 3, 4,\r\n6, 8), and the same modifications also occur with the suppression of\r\nthe petal-stamens, etc. But a _ring_ or sometimes _cup-like glandular\r\nstructure_ (_disc_) is found _between_ the andrœcium and the gynœceum\r\n(Figs. 465, 466). The flowers similarly are regular, _hypogynous_, ☿\r\nand polypetalous, though exceptions are found to all these characters:\r\nthus, for example, united sepals and petals frequently occur, and,\r\nin some orders, unisexual flowers by the suppression of one sex. In\r\nmost cases the flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in\r\npaniculate inflorescences. The carpels (most frequently 5) are free in\r\na few, but generally united into a multilocular gynœceum; rarely more\r\nthan 1 or 2 ovules in each loculus. The gynœceum in the Anacardiaceæ\r\nis so reduced that it has only 1 fertile loculus with 1 ovule.--The\r\n_ovules are epitropous_, _i.e._ anatropous with outward-turned raphe\r\n(except the Anacardiaceæ).--The majority of the species are trees\r\nand shrubs with scattered, often _compound (pinnate) leaves_ without\r\nstipules, and as in addition they frequently contain _aromatic,\r\nespecially turpentine-like substances_, they assume a certain\r\nresemblance to the Walnut trees, and were formerly classed with them\r\nmainly on this account. In a series of genera the volatile, scented\r\noils are found in special glands in the bark of the branches and in the\r\nleaves, in the latter case appearing as _pellucid dots_. This family\r\nincludes several orders which are somewhat difficult to distinguish\r\nfrom each other.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Connaraceæ.= This order forms the connecting link\r\n   between Terebinthinæ and Rosifloræ (_Spiræa_) as well as\r\n   Leguminosæ, with which they are sometimes classed. The flowers\r\n   have 5 5-merous whorls; 2 ovules in each loculus; micropyle\r\n   turned upwards. Fruit a _follicle_, rarely a collection\r\n   of follicles. Seed with aril. Shrubs with scattered (most\r\n   frequently pinnate) leaves, without stipules. 170 species.\r\n   Tropical.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Meliaceæ.= Trees and shrubs with scattered, often\r\n   pinnate leaves without pellucid dots and exstipulate; the\r\n   leaflets are nearly always entire. Flowers small in paniculate\r\n   inflorescences. Calyx and corolla 4–5-merous; 2 whorls of\r\n   stamens; 3–5 carpels in the gynœceum. A very characteristic\r\n   feature is the union of the filaments into a tube, on the\r\n   edge of which stipule-like teeth are often found. There are\r\n   most frequently 2 ovules in the loculi; fruit a capsule with\r\n   many winged seeds in _Swietenia_ (Mahogany tree; Trop. Am.),\r\n   _Cedrela_, etc.; berries in others. The wood of _Cedrela_ is\r\n   used for making cigar boxes. 550 species; tropical.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Rutaceæ.= Leaves glandular with pellucid dots. The type\r\nis the same as that of the family. Flowers 4–5-merous. The ovary is\r\nmost frequently 4–5-grooved. Disc well pronounced, often appearing as\r\na “gynophore.” The majority are shrubs with alternate or opposite,\r\ncompound, more rarely simple, leaves.\r\n\r\n=A.= The ovary is deeply 2–5-cleft with basal styles which are more or\r\nless united; the carpels in some genera are entirely free (groups 1,\r\n2). The fruit is capsular and most frequently dehisces like follicles\r\nalong the ventral suture or septicidally, so that a horn-like internal\r\nlayer (endocarp) separates elastically from the external layer.\r\n\r\n   =1.= ZANTHOXYLEÆ. _Zanthoxylum_; _Choisya_; _Evodia_.\r\n\r\n   =2.= BORONIEÆ. Australia.--_Correa._\r\n\r\n   =3.= DIOSMEÆ. Heather-like shrubs; Africa.--_Diosma_,\r\n   _Coleonema_, _Empleurum_ and _Barosma_.

Several species are ornamental plants.~\r\n\r\n   =5.= CUSPARIEÆ. American. Flowers often zygomorphic with\r\n   gamopetalous corolla; stamens 5.--_Ticorea_; _Galipea_ (_G.\r\n   officinalis_; S. Am.; “Cortex angosturæ”); _Cusparia_;\r\n   _Almeidea_.\r\n\r\n=B.= The ovary is entire or only slightly grooved; the style is\r\nterminal, undivided. The fruit is most frequently a drupe or berry.\r\n\r\n   =6.= TODDALIEÆ. _Ptelea_; winged fruit. The buds are enclosed in\r\n   the leaf-sheath. _Skimmia_; _Phellodendron_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 468–470.--_Citrus vulgaris._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 468.--Branch with compound leaves.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 469.--Transverse section of fruit.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 470.--Flowers (after the removal of the petals).]\r\n\r\n=7.= AURANTIEÆ, ORANGE GROUP. Fruit a berry with a leathery external\r\nlayer.--The most typical flower is found for example in _Limonia_:\r\nS5, P5, A5 + 5, G5 (2–5).--_Citrus_ has 4–5–8-merous flowers, a\r\ngamosepalous, dentate calyx, free petals, one whorl of stamens which\r\nare split irregularly into several bundles (Fig. 470). The fruit is a\r\n_multilocular berry_ provided with a thick, tough, outer layer. The\r\njuicy pulp, which fills up the loculi and envelopes the seeds, is\r\nformed from many large-celled, juicy hair-structures which arise on the\r\ninner side of the walls of the loculi and by degrees entirely fill them\r\nup; the dissepiments remain thin, and form the partitions so easily\r\nseparating from each other (Fig. 469). The seeds in many instances are\r\nremarkable for containing several embryos. The blade of the leaf is\r\nseparated from the frequently winged stalk by a _node_ (and hence is a\r\ncompound leaf with only the terminal leaflet developed?) (Fig. 468);\r\nin other genera, as _Triphasia_, there is a fully developed trifoliate\r\nleaf. Thorns are frequently developed.--~The species of this genus,\r\nwhich is a native of the warmer parts of S. E. Asia, are very hard to\r\nseparate. The differences are found in the forms of the fruit, the\r\nleaves and the leaf-stalks, and in the number of stamens. _Citrus\r\nmedica_, “Cedrat” (Ind.); _C. limonum_, “Citron,” “Lemon” (introduced\r\ninto Italy in the 3rd to 4th century). OFFICINAL: the fruits and\r\nessential oil of Lemon. _C. aurantium_ from E. Asia, the Orange\r\n(introduced into Italy in the 14th century). _C. vulgaris_ (Fig. 468),\r\nBitter Orange (introduced into Europe at the time of the Crusades);\r\nthe unripe Bitter Oranges, and peel of the Bitter Orange is officinal;\r\nit is from the flowers of this species especially that the essence\r\nof Neroli is made. _C. limetta_, _C. bergamia_, Bergamot; essence of\r\nBergamot is officinal. _C. decumana_, Pomalo, a native of the Islands\r\nof the Pacific. About 780 species; chiefly tropical.~\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Burseraceæ.= Fruit a drupe; 1–5 stones. The bark,\r\n   as well as the other parts, contain strong aromatic resins\r\n   and balsams, and hence several species are used: the Myrrh\r\n   tree, _Commiphora_ (_Balsamodendron_) from Arabia and Africa;\r\n   OFFICINAL: Myrrha (_Commiphora myrrha_). Mecca-balsam from _C.\r\n   opobalsamum_, Arabia; E. Africa. The Incense-tree (_Boswellia_)\r\n   from the same parts of the globe and E. India. The incense of\r\n   _B. carteri_ is medicinal (Frankincense). The resin (Elemi) of\r\n   _Protium_-species is officinal, and is used technically for\r\n   varnish (S. Am.). Takamahaka-resin from _Elaphrium_ (S. Am.)\r\n   _Protium_ (_Icica_); _Amyris_ (1 carpel). 270 species; tropical.\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Zygophyllaceæ.= The majority have opposite, pinnate\r\n   leaves with stipules. _Leaves without pellucid dots._ The\r\n   filaments have a scale on the inner side. The most important is\r\n   _Guaiacum officinale_ (West India), the wood (Lignum Vitæ) of\r\n   which is very hard and heavy, this wood and Gum-guaiacum are\r\n   officinal. Others have a peculiar repulsive smell and taste: the\r\n   Creosote shrub (_Larrea mexicana_) and _Zygophyllum simplex_.\r\n   _Tribulus terrester_ is a common weed in S. Europe. _Fagonia._\r\n   _Peganum harmala_ (South of Russia) yields a red dye.--110\r\n   species; especially in the Tropics; several species in sandy\r\n   deserts. _Nitraria._\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Simarubaceæ.= This order is distinguished by the\r\n   abundance of _bitter_ substances which it contains (Quassine)\r\n   especially in the bark and the wood. The wood of _Quassia amara_\r\n   (Guiana, Antilles) is officinal; _Picraena excelsa_ yields\r\n   Jamaica Quassia; the bark of _Simaruba_, _Simaba_-species\r\n   and others is used. _Ailanthus glandulosa_ is a garden plant\r\n   (pinnate leaves, winged fruit).--110 species. Tropical.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Ochnaceæ.= Flowers diplostemonous, 5-merous. The\r\n   unilocular ovaries, which are individually free, project\r\n   considerably into the air around the gynobasic style; 1 ovule\r\n   in each loculus; the fruitlets are drupes. Shrubs; leaves\r\n   alternate, with stipules. _Ochna_; _Ouratea_.--160 species;\r\n   tropical; especially American.\r\n\r\n   Order 8. =Anacardiaceæ.= The ovary rarely contains more than 1\r\n   ovule, even though there be several loculi and several carpels;\r\n   in _Anacardium_ all the 10 stamens except one become suppressed.\r\n   Resin passages.--_Anacardium._ The most peculiar feature is the\r\n   development of the flower-stalk into a fleshy body about the\r\n   form and size of a pear (_A. occidentale_ from Trop. Am. and\r\n   _A. orientale_ from E. Ind.) which bears the kidney-shaped nut\r\n   (the so-called “Cashew-nut”) on its apex. _Mangifera indica_\r\n   (the Mango-tree, from E. Ind.) is cultivated in several tropical\r\n   countries on account of its delicious drupe. Similarly, species\r\n   of _Spondias_ (_S. dulcis_, Pacific Islands, _S. lutea_).\r\n   Several species of _Rhus_ are ornamental shrubs in this country,\r\n   for instance, _R. typhina_ (N. Am.), _R. cotinus_ (the Wig-tree,\r\n   the _barren_ flower-stalks of the panicles being feather-like\r\n   and hairy); _R. toxicodendron_ (Poisonous Sumach, from N. Am.)\r\n   is poisonous. Chinese galls are produced by the sting of a\r\n   leaf-louse (_Aphis chinensis_) on _R. semialata_ (China), and\r\n   Japanese wax is from the seeds of _R. succedanea_ (Japan).\r\n   Considerable quantities of Sumach (_R. coriaria_) are used in\r\n   tanning and as a black dye. OFFICINAL: the mastic resin of\r\n   _Pistacia lentiscus_ (the Mastic-tree, from the Mediterranean).\r\n   The fruits of _Pistacia vera_ (Syria) are edible; _P.\r\n   terebinthus_ and others yield turpentine.--450 species; tropical.\r\n\r\n   Order 9. =Icacinaceæ.= Flowers 4–5-merous; haplostemonous;\r\n   receptacle convex or cup-like surrounding the gynœceum; in\r\n   the (single) loculus of the ovary, 2 anatropous, pendulous\r\n   ovules.--200 species; tropical.\r\n\r\n                        Family 16. =Aesculinæ.=\r\n\r\nThe essential characters of this family are in the main the same as\r\nthose of the Terebinthinæ and Gruinales. The flowers are hypogynous,\r\nperfect, with free petals, 5-merous (S5, P5, typically A5 + 5, all\r\nof which, however, are not generally developed; in our native orders\r\nthere are only 7–8 stamens), and most frequently a _3-merous, 3-locular\r\ngynœceum_ (less frequently 2 or 5 carpels with as many loculi). In\r\neach loculus there are usually only 1–2 ovules. A deviation from the\r\npreceding families is the frequent _zygomorphy_ of the flower, with,\r\nas a rule an _oblique_ plane of symmetry (Fig. 471). When a _disc_ is\r\ndeveloped it is placed _outside_ the stamens. The majority have no\r\nendosperm (Fig. 473).--The members of the family are nearly all trees.\r\n\r\n   The family is closely allied to the Terebinthinæ, but unlike\r\n   this it never has aromatic properties, and differs also\r\n   in the position of the nectary, in the flowers, which are\r\n   often irregular with a reduction in the number of stamens,\r\n   and in the ovule which is usually ascending with micropyle\r\n   pointing downwards (the Terebinthinæ having the micropyle\r\n   turned upwards), etc. It is also related to Frangulinæ, the\r\n   Staphyleaceæ being the chief connecting link; but the Æsculinæ\r\n   generally have compound leaves.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Staphyleaceæ.= Leaves opposite, often compound.\r\n   Flowers regular, ☿, 5-merous in calyx and corolla, 5-stamened.\r\n   The stamens are placed _outside_ the nectary. Ovary syncarpous\r\n   or 2–3-partite with free styles. The capsule is thin,\r\n   bladder-like, 2–3-locular, opening at the apex, and has several\r\n   very hard seeds with a shining testa without aril. Endosperm.\r\n   _Staphylea pinnata_ (S. Europe) and _trifoliata_ (N. Am.) are\r\n   cultivated in gardens; they have white flowers in pendulous,\r\n   axillary racemes or panicles.--16 species.--_Staphylea_ is found\r\n   in the Tertiary of N. America.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Melianthaceæ.= Glaucous shrubs with scattered, pinnate\r\n   leaves, and large stipules. _Melianthus._--8 species; S. Africa.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Sapindaceæ.= Trees or shrubs, often climbing by tendrils\r\n(lianes with anomalous structure of the stem) and with compound leaves.\r\nThe flowers, in most cases, are small, insignificant, and without\r\nscent, and in some polygamous and zygomorphic. S4–5, P4–5, A8 (less\r\nfrequently 5–10) inside the nectary (disc); ovary generally 3-locular,\r\nwith 1–2 ovules in each loculus (raphe ventral, micropyle turned\r\ndownwards). Seed without endosperm, often with an aril. The embryo is\r\noften thick and curved (Fig. 473).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 471–473.--_Æsculus hippocastanum._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 471.--Diagram of the flower and of a scorpioid cyme.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 472.--Flower in longitudinal section.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 473.--Seed in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n_Æsculus_ (Horse-Chestnut). Trees with opposite, digitate, dentate\r\nleaves without stipules; the inflorescence is composed of unipared\r\nscorpioid cymes arranged in a pyramidal panicle (termed a thyrsus). The\r\nflowers are irregular, with an _oblique plane of symmetry_ (through the\r\n4th sepal, Fig. 471); there are 5 sepals, 5 free petals, of which the\r\none lying between S^3 and S^5 is the smallest (see Fig. 471) and may\r\nbe absent; stamens 7 (5 + 2), three being suppressed; gynœceum simple,\r\n3-carpellary and 3-locular, with single style; of the two ovules one is\r\nascending, the other descending (Fig. 472).--The fruit is a 3-valvate,\r\nsometimes spiny, capsule, with loculicidal dehiscence, the seed having\r\na large hilum, a curved embryo without endosperm and united cotyledons\r\n(the radicle lies in a fold of the testa, Fig. 473). _Æ. hippocastanum_\r\n(Greece, Asia), introduced into cultivation about 300 years ago;\r\nthe majority of the other species, _e.g. Æ. pavia_, etc., several\r\nof which are frequently cultivated in gardens, are from N. America.\r\n~The flower of the Horse-Chestnut is adapted for bees, whose abdomen\r\ntouches the anthers or style when visiting the flower. The flowers are\r\nprotogynous.~\r\n\r\n   The other Sapindaceæ have most frequently 4 sepals, 8 stamens,\r\n   various fruits (septicidal capsule, nuts with or without wings,\r\n   schizocarp), etc. _Serjania_, _Cardiospermum_, _Sapindus_,\r\n   _Koelreuteria_, etc. (about 118 genera, 970 species). The seeds\r\n   of _Paullinia sorbilis_ contain caffeine, and are used as “Pasta\r\n   guaranà,” in the North Western Brazils in the manufacture of a\r\n   common drink. _Nephelium_ (or _Euphoria_) _litchi_ (with edible\r\n   aril), and other species, from Asia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 474.--Samara of _Acer platanoides_.]\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Aceraceæ.= This order is so closely allied to the Sapindaceæ,\r\nthat some authorities have classed it with them. The main difference\r\nis in the _regularity_ of the flowers, and the =2=-merous gynœceum\r\n(in abnormal cases several carpels occur).--They are trees, and, like\r\nthe Horse-Chestnuts, have opposite leaves without stipules; in _Acer_\r\nthe leaves are palminerved, but imparipinnate in _Negundo_, a plant\r\nfrequently cultivated in gardens. The flowers are often unisexual,\r\npolygamous (some species have ☿-, ♂-and ♀-flowers); sepals 5, petals\r\n5 free, =stamens 8= (that is, 5 + 5, but the two median ones are\r\nabsent) inside a large disc. Fruit a samara (schizocarp) with 2\r\n_winged, nut-like_ fruitlets (Fig. 474). In each of the 2 loculi of the\r\novary are 2 ovules. Embryo _curved_, with thin, _folded_ cotyledons.\r\nEndosperm absent.--~The inflorescences are racemes with a more or\r\nless elongated main axis and terminal flower (which sometimes has 10\r\nstamens); when the lateral branches are developed they are similar\r\nto the main axis. In some species both corolla and petal-stamens are\r\nsuppressed. _Acer_ is pollinated by insects, _Negundo_ by the wind.--88\r\nspecies; North Temperate zone. _Acer_ in the Tertiary from the\r\nOligocene. The following are native plants: Maple (_Acer campestre_),\r\nSycamore (_A. pseudoplatanus_, doubtful native). Important as avenue\r\ntrees and timber. Sugar is obtained from the spring sap of the Sugar\r\nMaple (N. Am.).~\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Malpighiaceæ.= A tropical (especially American) order\r\n   closely related to the Aceraceæ, having often the same form of\r\n   fruit (but 3-partite). Some species are lianes with anomalous\r\n   stem-structure. Leaves opposite. The flowers are regular or\r\n   obliquely zygomorphic (the plane of symmetry passing through\r\n   sepal 3), with S5, P5, A5 + 5, G3; 1 pendulous ovule in each\r\n   loculus. Important characteristics for identification are the\r\n   numerous grandular structures on the sepals. Peculiar 2-spined\r\n   hairs are found in some. _Malpighia_, _Bunchosia_, _Galphimia_,\r\n   _Tetrapterys_, _Heteropterys_, etc.--About 600 species.\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Erythroxylaceæ.= Sepals 5, petals 5 (with a ligular\r\n   corona), 10 stamens in one bundle. Gynœceum 3-locular. Fruit\r\n   a drupe. Tropical (especially American) trees and shrubs, the\r\n   _Coca-plant_ (_Erythroxylon coca_) being best known. Its leaves\r\n   are considered by the inhabitants of Chile and Peru to be one\r\n   of the indispensable necessaries of life; they are chewed, and\r\n   possess intoxicating, exhilarating properties, and contain\r\n   the alkaloid cocaine, which is frequently employed as a local\r\n   anæsthetic.--103 species; chiefly in America.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Vochysiaceæ.= Trees; Trop.

The flowers are usually borne in\r\nterminal spikes or racemes, and are strongly zygomorphic (_the plane\r\nof symmetry being median_); they have 5 free sepals, the 2 _lateral\r\nones_ of which (4 and 5 in Figs. 475, 476) are very large, _petaloid_,\r\nand frequently project on each side like the “wings” of a Pea-flower;\r\npetals 5, of which the two lateral ones are wanting or rudimentary\r\n(dotted on Fig. 475), and the _anterior_ “the _keel_” (Fig. 476 _c_)\r\nis large, hollow and boat-shaped, and frequently with a lobed or\r\nfimbriated edge (Fig. 476 _A_ and _B_, _c_); stamens 8, the two median\r\nones being absent, all _united_ into a tube split along the back, which\r\nis also slightly united to the keel (the anthers, often 2 locular,\r\n_open by pores_, Fig. 476 _B_, _st_); the 2 median carpels form a\r\nbilocular ovary. 1 pendulous ovule in each loculus (Figs. 476 _C_,\r\n475); capsule compressed with loculicidal dehiscence, rarely a nut.\r\n_Polygala_ (Milk-wort).\r\n\r\n   470 species; distributed over the whole globe (none Arctic).\r\n   OFFICINAL: the root of _P. senega_, from N. Am. Some are used as\r\n   ornamental plants.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. The flowers of _Polygala_ are pollinated by insects\r\n   (chiefly bees). The fimbriated processes of the anterior petal\r\n   support the insect when it alights. The anthers lie on each\r\n   side of the stigma in the pouch of the anterior petal; the apex\r\n   of the style is spoon-shaped, and immediately behind it is a\r\n   viscid stigmatic lobe. In reaching the honey the proboscis of\r\n   the insect must come in contact with the pollen and the viscid\r\n   stigma, by which it is rendered sticky; this ensures the pollen\r\n   adhering to the proboscis and so being carried to other flowers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 476.--_Polygala amara._ Parts of the flower\r\n  (mag.) _A_ Flower from side, 1-5 sepals: _c_ keel; _B_ flower\r\n  from above spread out: _st_ the 8 stamens; _c_ fimbriated edge of\r\n  “keel”; _C_ ovary with style and stigma.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 17. =Frangulinæ.=\r\n\r\nThe plants belonging to this family, with very few exceptions, are\r\ntrees or shrubs. The leaves are usually simple; stipules may be\r\nabsent or present. The flowers in almost all the orders are _small,\r\ngreen or whitish_; they are _always regular_, 4-_or_ 5-_merous_ with\r\n2–5 _carpels_, but never have more than 1 _whorl of stamens_, which\r\nin _Rhamnaceæ_ and _Ampelidaceæ_ are placed _opposite_ the petals\r\n(typically 5 + 5 or 4 + 4 stamens, of which however either the\r\nexternal or internal whorl is always wanting); hypogynous or slightly\r\nperigynous, in _Rhamnaceæ_ only strongly perigynous or epigynous;\r\ngenerally ☿; the calyx is inconspicuous; petals free or slightly\r\nunited. Gynœceum simple; _ovary generally multilocular_; style short or\r\nentirely wanting. A _disc_ is nearly always developed in the flower,\r\nbut is found sometimes inside the staminal whorl, sometimes outside\r\nit or between the stamens. The ovules are apotropous (anatropous with\r\ndorsal or ventral raphe).\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Celastraceæ.= _Euonymus europæa_ (Spindle-tree) may be\r\nchosen as a type. It is a shrub with simple, opposite leaves and\r\nsmall caducous stipules. The small, greenish-yellow flowers, borne\r\nin regularly-branched dichasia, are regular, ☿, with 4 whorls, 4-(or\r\n5-) merous in regular alternation. There is a _thick disc_ upon which\r\nthe polypetalous corolla (imbricate in the bud) and the stamens are\r\nborne, with a slightly perigynous insertion. The style is short and\r\nthick; the ovary has 2 _erect_ ovules in each loculus. The fruit is\r\na red, 4-valvate capsule with loculicidal dehiscence; the seeds are\r\nfew in number, and have a large, red-yellow _aril_ (developed from\r\nthe micropyle). Embryo green, in a large, fleshy, white endosperm.\r\n~The dingy yellow flowers are generally visited only by flies and ants\r\nfor the sake of the honey secreted by the disc, and while they run\r\nabout on the flowers they touch the anthers and stigmas, now with one\r\npart of the body, now with another. The flower is protandrous. The\r\nstigmas are not developed till several days after the opening of the\r\nanthers.--_Celastrus_, _Cassine_, _Catha_, etc.~\r\n\r\n   38 genera; 300 species. Distributed over the entire globe, with\r\n   the exception of the colder districts, and especially in the\r\n   Tropics. Some are ornamental bushes (_Euonymus japonica_). The\r\n   leaves of _Catha edulis_ are used by the Arabs and Abyssinians\r\n   in the same way as those of _Coca_ by the Peruvians.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Hippocrateaceæ.= 150 species; tropical; chiefly\r\n   lianes. S5, P5, A3, G3. Anthers extrorse.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 477.--_Ilex aquifolium_: magnified flower.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Aquifoliaceæ (Hollies).= The genus _Ilex_ forms almost the\r\nentire order. (175 species out of 180; especially from S. Am.) They\r\nare shrubs or trees with scattered, leathery, simple leaves (in _Ilex\r\naquifolium_, spiny) with very small stipules. The flowers are small,\r\nwhite, and borne in few-flowered inflorescences in the axils of the\r\nfoliage-leaves; they are most frequently unisexual and diœcious. There\r\nare 4–5 sepals, petals, stamens and carpels in regular alternation;\r\nthe calyx and _corolla_ have their leaves _slightly_ connate; stamens\r\nslightly adnate to the corolla; the ovary is generally almost spherical\r\nwith a thick, sessile stigma (Fig. 477). This order deviates especially\r\nfrom _Celastraceæ_ in the _absence of the disc_ and in having only\r\n1 (_pendulous_) ovule in each of the 4 loculi of the ovary, and in\r\nhaving a _drupe_ with generally 4 stones. Embryo extremely small, at\r\nthe apex of the large endosperm, with the radicle directed upwards.--~3\r\ngenera.--_I. aquifolium_ (Holly) principally on the coasts of European\r\ncountries; from Norway to W. Denmark, and further westward. It is a\r\ncommon garden shrub with stiff, shining leaves and red fruits. Several\r\nSouth American species contain so much _caffeine_ that they may be used\r\nas a beverage in the place of tea (_I. paraguayensis_, Paraguay tea, or\r\nMaté). The Holly does not contain caffeine.~\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Ampelidaceæ (Vines).= Shrubs with the stem swollen at the\r\ninsertion of the petioles and climbing by _tendrils borne opposite\r\nthe leaves_ (Figs. 478, 479). The leaves are scattered (generally\r\n1/2), stalked, stipulate, frequently palminerved and lobed, divided or\r\ncompound. The small, greenish flowers are generally borne in paniculate\r\n_inflorescences, whose position is the same as that of the tendrils_\r\n(Fig. 478); they are hypogynous or slightly perigynous, ☿, with 4–5\r\nsepals, petals, stamens (which, as in the Rhamneæ, are _opposite the\r\npetals_; Fig. 480 _A_, _B_) and 2 carpels. The calyx is very small,\r\nentire, or slightly dentate; corolla _valvate_, and in some falling off\r\nas a hood, since the individual parts remain united at the summit (Fig.\r\n480 _A_). Between the stamens and gynœceum is situated an hypogynous\r\n_disc_, with 5 lobes alternating with the stamens (Fig. 480 _A_, _B_,\r\n_E_). In each loculus of the 2-locular ovary there are 2 _erect_\r\novules (_E_); the style is short or wanting. The fruit is a _berry_.\r\nThe embryo is small and lies in a horny, sometimes slightly folded\r\n(ruminate) endosperm (Fig. 480 _C_, _D_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 478–481.--_Vitis vinifera._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 478.--Branch with bunch of grapes.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 479.--Diagram of the position of leaf and tendrils.

The\r\n   inflorescence in _Pterisanthes_ (E. Ind.) has a peculiar, flat,\r\n   leaf-like axis, on the edges of which ♂-flowers are borne, and\r\n   on the surface ♀-flowers.\r\n\r\n   The TENDRILS in Ampelidaceæ are modified branches, since they\r\n   bear leaves and may be abnormally developed as branches with\r\n   foliage-leaves, and finally the inflorescences are borne in\r\n   the position of the tendrils, and tendrils are met with which\r\n   are partly inflorescences. The explanation of the position\r\n   of the tendril, namely, right opposite the foliage-leaf but\r\n   without a subtending-leaf, has been much disputed. The relative\r\n   positions are as follows: in _Vitis vinifera_ the following\r\n   two kinds of shoots and relative positions are found (the\r\n   other species deviate in one or other particular), (_a_)\r\n   LONG-BRANCHES, which have 2 scale-leaves and a large number of\r\n   foliage-leaves with a divergence of 1/2; opposite the lowest\r\n   3–5 foliage-leaves no tendrils are found, then follow: 2\r\n   foliage-leaves with tendrils, 1 without a tendril, 2 with and\r\n   1 without, etc., with great regularity. Buds are developed in\r\n   the axils of the foliage-leaves (Fig. 479): these develop into\r\n   (_b_) DWARF-BRANCHES, which commence with 1 laterally-placed\r\n   scale-leaf (fore-leaf; Fig. 481 _v_) succeeded by several\r\n   foliage-leaves with a divergence of 1/2 (in a plane at right\r\n   angles to that of the mother-shoot), but the whole shoot is\r\n   extremely small, and often dries up and drops off in the\r\n   autumn, so that only the scale-leaf, _v_, with the bud (Fig.\r\n   481 _lt_{1}_) in its axil remains. This bud in the following\r\n   year developes into a new long-branch, and since its leaves\r\n   lie in a plane at right angles to that of the dwarf-branch,\r\n   their plane coincides with that of the long-branch from which\r\n   it is developed (the grandmother axis).--The tendrils no doubt\r\n   may most correctly be regarded as the modified main axis which\r\n   has been pushed aside by a lateral branch. The branches are\r\n   then sympodia, whose successive shoots bear alternately 1\r\n   and 2 foliage-leaves: thus, on the figure there are portions\r\n   altogether of 5 shoots (I.-V.), the 1-leaved ones are shaded,\r\n   the 2-leaved ones are white. The following facts however are\r\n   adverse to this theory: (1) the first leaf on an axillary bud\r\n   is then situated 180° from the subtending leaf (_e.g._ the\r\n   lowermost shaded leaf, Fig. 479, 180° from the lowermost white\r\n   leaf), whilst the rule in the Dicotyledons is that it is placed\r\n   only about 90° to one side. (2) The buds (Fig. 479 _K_) from\r\n   which the dwarf-branches develop, must then be accessory and\r\n   sister-buds to the sympodial shoots, but their first leaves have\r\n   a different relative position to this, which is very peculiar,\r\n   and a still more remarkable fact is that the buds, _K_, etc. are\r\n   similar in structure and present in _all the axils_; thus we\r\n   _only_ find accessory buds in the cases where no tendrils are\r\n   opposite to the leaves, and the main bud must then be considered\r\n   to be suppressed. (3) The development proves that the tendrils\r\n   arise on the side of a vigorous growing-point of the stem or by\r\n   its division, and do not develop, as might be expected, from\r\n   the apex of the shoot. But these relations however, find their\r\n   analogues and are all capable of explanation, whereas other less\r\n   natural modes of explanation are opposed to them.\r\n\r\n   435 species; especially in the Tropics; they are rarer in\r\n   America. In N. Am. some _Vitis_-species and _Ampelopsis\r\n   quinquefolia_ are found. _Vitis vinifera_ is supposed to have\r\n   originated in the districts East and South of the Caspian Sea.\r\n   Wine is obtained from _Vitis_-species, especially _V. vinifera_,\r\n   and “raisins,”--(the name “currants,” given to a special variety\r\n   with small, seedless fruits, is derived from Corinth).--The\r\n   species of _Ampelopsis_ (Virginian Creeper) are cultivated as\r\n   ornamental plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Rhamnaceæ.= _The stamens are placed opposite the petals_\r\nas in the Ampelidaceæ (Fig. 482), but the flowers are _much more\r\nperigynous or entirely epigynous_. The trees and shrubs belonging\r\nto this order have simple, most frequently penninerved leaves with\r\nstipules; frequently thorny (modified branches). The flowers are\r\ninconspicuous, sometimes unisexual (Fig. 482), and have 5 (-4) sepals,\r\npetals, stamens, and generally 3 (2–5) carpels. The calyx has _valvate_\r\næstivation. The petals are very _small_ (generally less than the\r\nsepals), often spoon-like, hollow, and embracing the stamens; _a disc\r\ncovers the inner surface of the thalamus_ or the base of the style in\r\nthe epigynous flower; gynœceum simple, with one style and one _erect\r\novule in each loculus_. The fruit is most frequently a _drupe_. The\r\nembryo is large, often green or yellow, with endosperm.\r\n\r\n_Rhamnus_ (Buckthorn) has a juicy drupe with 3 (2–4) stones, surrounded\r\nat the base by the persistent portion of the receptacle; the disc is\r\nthin. _R. cathartica_ (common Buckthorn): diœcious, with opposite,\r\nserrate leaves. _R. frangula_ (Alder Buckthorn): flowers ☿, with\r\nscattered, entire leaves.--~_Ceanothus_ (N.

They have a _strongly perigynous_, regular,\r\n_4-merous_ flower. The receptacle (often coloured) envelopes a simple\r\ngynœceum formed of =1= _carpel_ and with, in most cases, =1= ovule,\r\nbearing on its edge 4 (or 5) petaloid sepals and, but rarely at the\r\nsame time, small, scale-like petals. The corolla is most frequently\r\nentirely wanting (and hence these plants were formerly reckoned among\r\nthe Monochlamydeæ); frequently only one of the 2 whorls of stamens,\r\nwhich are situated on the inner side of the edge of the receptacle, is\r\ndeveloped. The fruit is most frequently a _1-seeded_ berry or drupe, or\r\na nut which may be falsely berry-like, the partly persistent receptacle\r\nbeing fleshy and enveloping it.\r\n\r\n   This family appears the most nearly allied to the Frangulinæ,\r\n   especially the Rhamnaceæ, and may be considered as a further\r\n   development of these in the direction of the petaloid\r\n   development of the receptacle and reduction of the corolla and\r\n   gynœceum, which in this instance only consists of one carpel.\r\n   Another deviation is that both the whorls of stamens are\r\n   present, while one of these is always wanting in Frangulinæ.\r\n   They also appear to be related to the Lauraceæ (see page 391).\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Thymelæaceæ.= The flowers are most frequently ☿ (Fig. 483).\r\nThe receptacle is high, generally tubular, coloured, and bears on its\r\nedge the 4-(or 5)-merous calyx, with imbricate æstivation. The corolla\r\nis wanting or is represented by small scales. The stamens are situated\r\non the inside of the receptacle, and number 4 + 4 (or 5 + 5); stigma\r\ncapitate. 1 _pendulous ovule_ (Fig. 483 _B_), the _radicle pointing\r\nupwards_.

Africa (2/10–3/10). a few species in S. Am. Trees or\r\nshrubs, leaves generally scattered, without stipules, and more or\r\nless dry, leathery, evergreen, and often of very different forms on\r\nthe same plant (undivided, compound, etc.) The flowers are ☿ (rarely\r\nunisexual), and _4-merous_ in the single, petaloid perianth and in the\r\nstaminal whorl; 1 carpel; sometimes zygomorphic. The perianth-leaves\r\nare generally almost free, with _valvate_, æstivation, often leathery.\r\nSmall scales alternating with the perianth are often found at the\r\nbase of the ovary. The stamens generally have extremely short\r\nfilaments, and are situated opposite, sometimes quite on the tip of the\r\nperianth-leaves, in a spoon-like groove. The gynœceum is 1-locular, has\r\n1–several ovules, and is often raised on a stalk-like internode. The\r\nfruit is a follicle or nut. The seeds, most frequently winged, have no\r\nendosperm.--_Protea_, _Manglesia_, _Hakea_, _Banksia_, _Grevillea_,\r\netc. 50 genera; about 1,000 species. Several species are cultivated in\r\nour conservatories for the sake of the flowers, which are beautifully\r\ncoloured and arranged in crowded inflorescences. Protandrous. It is\r\ndoubtful whether they were existent in Europe in the Tertiary Period.\r\nThe true systematic position of the order is doubtful. They are related\r\nto the Leguminosæ and Rosifloræ, but more closely no doubt to the two\r\npreceding orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 19. =Saxifraginæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flower is generally perfect, regular and polypetalous, usually\r\n_perigynous_ or _epigynous_, _eucyclic_ and 5-merous; most frequently\r\nS5, P5, A5 + 5 or 5 + 0 and G=2=-5, but other numbers are found,\r\nespecially 4; the flowers are very frequently obdiplostemonous. The\r\ncalyx is sometimes large and the corolla small; the carpels in some\r\nare entirely free, in others more or less united. Endosperm is found\r\nin the majority. ~The hypogynous forms approach the Cistifloræ, the\r\nothers the following families, especially the Rosifloræ. This family\r\nis not, upon the whole, so well defined and natural as most of the\r\nothers. The Saxifragaceæ proper, approach very near to the Rosaceæ,\r\nespecially _Spiræa_, and form a transition to it. The forms with\r\nopposite leaves, as _Philadelphus_, etc., approach the Myrtifloræ, just\r\nas the Escalloniæ appear to be closely allied to Bicornes, especially\r\n_Vacciniaceæ_. Finally through _Pittosporaceæ_, they pass over to the\r\nFrangulinæ. The family terminates in very reduced forms, on the one\r\nhand in the arborescent orders with crowded inflorescences, on the\r\nother perhaps in the very remarkable order _Podostemaceæ_.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 487.--Diagram of a 6-merous flower (_Sedum\r\n  hispanicum_): _w_ branch of scorpioid cyme in the axil of the\r\n  bracteole β.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Crassulaceæ.= Nearly all are herbs or small shrubs with\r\nround, succulent branches and scattered, _fleshy_, often more or less\r\nround leaves, which are very rarely incised, and never have stipules.\r\nThe flowers are generally borne in dichasia or unipared scorpioid\r\ncymes, which again may be arranged in racemes, umbels, etc.; they are\r\nregular, ☿, hypogynous or perigynous, and most frequently have free\r\nsepals and petals (gamopetalous corollas with sessile stamens are found\r\nin _Cotyledon_, _Bryophyllum_, _Echeveria_, and others); the floral\r\nformula is Sn, Pn, An + n, Gn, where n may have very different values,\r\npartly depending upon the size of the flower (_e.g._ 4–7 in _Sedum_,\r\nFig. 487; 6–30 in _Sempervivum_; 4 in _Rhodiola_, _Bryophyllum_,\r\nand _Kalanchoë_; 5 in _Echeveria_, _Umbilicus_, _Cotyledon_). The\r\ncarpels are _free_ and are _placed opposite the petals_ (Fig. 487).\r\nFruit a _syncarp composed of follicles_ containing many, small seeds\r\nwithout endosperm. Outside each carpel is found a small, nectariferous\r\nscale (Fig. 487). ~The northern genus, _Rhodiola_, is diœcious. The\r\npetal-stamens are wanting in some (_Crassula_, _Bulliarda_, and\r\nothers). The floral-leaves are very often displaced upon their axillary\r\nbranches. A multicarpellary gynœceum also occurs.~\r\n\r\n_Sedum_ (Stonecrop) is generally 5-merous with 10 stamens; _Sempervivum\r\ntectorum_ (House-leek), 12-merous, and with 24 stamens. ~The leaves\r\nof _Bryophyllum calycinum_ very readily form buds, and also frequently\r\nexude water from the edges.~\r\n\r\n   485 species; especially Temp. (Cape, Europe). Principally used\r\n   as ornamental plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Saxifragaceæ.= The flowers are 4–5-merous with =2= (-3)\r\ncarpels, most frequently: S5, P5, A5 + 5 (obdiplostemonous), G2. They\r\nare regular, ☿, polypetalous, hypogynous, perigynous or most frequently\r\n_more or less epigynous_ (Fig. 488). The carpels may be individually\r\nquite free, but are more frequently united at the base, or the entire\r\nportion enclosing the ovules is united into a 1- or 2-locular ovary, the\r\nstyles, however, are always free. _Fruit a capsule_ with many seeds;\r\nendosperm present.--They are herbs, most frequently with _scattered_\r\nleaves without stipules; but the leaf-base is broad. The inflorescences\r\nare most frequently cymose, and a displacement of the floral-leaves is\r\nfrequent (_e.g._ _Chrysosplenium_).--~Some _Saxifraga_-species, _e.g._\r\n_S. sarmentosa_, have irregular flower with an _oblique_ plane of\r\nsymmetry. The petal-stamens in some may be wanting: _Heuchera_, species\r\nof _Saxifraga_ and _Mitella_. The corolla is wanting in others.~\r\n\r\n_Saxifraga_ (Saxifrage): S5, P5, A5 + 5, G2 (Fig. 488); capsule\r\nbilocular, opening along the ventral suture between the 2 persistent\r\nstyles. ~_S. granulata_ has small tubers at the base of the\r\nstem.~--_Chrysosplenium_ (Golden Saxifrage): 4 sepals, _no corolla_, 4\r\n+ 4 stamens; 1-locular capsule.\r\n\r\n   Protandry is most frequently found in _Saxifraga_, with the\r\n   stamens successively bending towards the gynœceum; protogyny\r\n   is more rare. In other genera there is protogyny without any\r\n   movement of the stamens; _Chrysosplenium_ is homogamous.--About\r\n   300 species; mostly in temperate climates. _Saxifraga_ is\r\n   especially Alpine. _S. crassifolia_ and other species, _Hoteia\r\n   japonica_, _Tellima_, etc., are ornamental plants.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 488.--_Saxifraga granulata._ Longitudinal\r\n  section of flower.]\r\n\r\nThe following genera are allied to the Saxifragaceæ:--\r\n\r\n=1.= _Parnassia_ (about 14 species; _P. palustris_, Grass of\r\nParnassus). The flower is slightly perigynous, and has S5, P5, 5\r\nfertile sepal-stamens, and 5 petal-stamens, which are developed as\r\nbarren staminodes, palmately-lobed, and (3–) 4 carpels united in a\r\n1-locular ovary with (3–) 4 parietal placentæ. Capsule.--~Protandrous.\r\nThe flower has a slightly oblique plane of symmetry, which is\r\nespecially shown during its development and in the order of sequence\r\nin which the anthers dehisce: originally they lie closely round the\r\ngynœceum; the anthers dehisce extrorsely, first the one which is placed\r\nopposite the most external sepal (the 2/5 arrangement is very distinct\r\nin the calyx), the filament elongating so that the anther lies over\r\nthe ovary, and this is followed successively by the 4 others in a\r\nzig-zag line; the filaments bend backwards after the pollen is shed\r\nand the anthers drop off, and the stigmas are not developed until this\r\nis completed. The barren stamens are palmately divided into an uneven\r\nnumber (7, 9, 11) of lobes, tapering from the centre towards the edge,\r\nand bearing apparently glandular tips; their gland-like appearance is\r\nsupposed to allure flies to visit the flower, or they may act as a kind\r\nof fence which compels the insects to enter the flower in a certain\r\nway, and thus effect pollination; the honey is secreted on their inner\r\nside, and not by the gland-like tips.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 489.--Portion of _Cephalotus follicularis_:\r\n  _k_ pitcher-like leaf with thick corrugated edge (_m_) and lid\r\n  (_l_); _b_ foliage-leaf of the ordinary form.]\r\n\r\n=2.= _Adoxa moschatellina_ (Moschatel). This is a perennial, creeping\r\nherb; the horizontal rhizome has an unlimited growth, and bears, in\r\na _scattered_ arrangement, both foliage-leaves, and white, fleshy\r\nscale-leaves. The aerial stem bears 2 opposite foliage-leaves and a\r\ncapitate inflorescence of 5 flowers, 4 placed laterally (in opposite\r\npairs) and 1 terminally. The flower is semi-epigynous, the calyx\r\ngamosepalous, corolla absent. The stamens are divided to the base, so\r\nthat each filament bears a bilocular anther. The style is free, deeply\r\ncleft. The _terminal_ flower has 2 bracteoles, 4 sepals, 4 stamens,\r\ncleft to the base, and a 4-locular ovary. The bracts of the _lateral_\r\nflowers are displaced on the flower-stalk, as in _Chrysosplenium_, and\r\nunited with the 2 bracteoles into a kind of 3-leaved involucre; these\r\nflowers have 5 sepals, 5 split stamens with 2-locular anthers, and a\r\n5-locular ovary. 1 pendulous ovule in each loculus. Fruit a _drupe_,\r\ngreen-coloured, with 1–5 stones.--This plant, which would perhaps\r\nbe best placed in a special order, has also been classed with the\r\nAraliaceæ and Caprifoliaceæ.\r\n\r\n   The following are also allied to this order: _Escalloniaceæ_\r\n   (arborescent plants with simple, scattered, leathery leaves),\r\n   _Cunoniaceæ_ (arborescent with opposite leaves), _Cephalotaceæ_\r\n   (with pitcher-like, insect-catching leaves; Australia; Fig.\r\n   489) and _Francoaceæ_. These have respectively 85, 107, 1 and 3\r\n   species.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 490–492.--_Ribes rubrum._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 490.--Floral diagram.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 491.--Flower in longitudinal section.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 492.--Seeds in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Ribesiaceæ= (=Currants=). 5-stamened Saxifragaceæ with\r\nepigynous flowers.--Moderately sized shrubs with _scattered_, stalked\r\nand palminerved, and generally palmilobed leaves, with a large\r\nleaf-sheath. The flowers (Figs. 490, 491), most frequently borne in\r\n_racemes_, are regular, _epigynous_, and have often, _above the ovary_,\r\na cup- or bell-shaped, or tubular prolongation of the receptacle, on\r\nwhich the sepals, petals and stamens are situated; they have 5 sepals\r\n(often large, coloured), 5 _small_, free petals, only =5= stamens\r\n(opposite the sepals) and a =2=-carpellate gynœceum with a _unilocular_\r\novary and 2 _parietal_ placentæ bearing many ovules. The fruit is a\r\n_berry_, whose seeds have a fleshy and juicy outer covering (Fig. 492).\r\n~In some species, for example _Ribes grossularia_, there is found an\r\nunbranched, or a 3–5-branched spine, very closely resembling the spiny\r\nleaves of the _Berberis_, but which, however, are emergences springing\r\nfrom the base of the petiole. _Ribes_ has two kinds of branches:\r\nlong-branches and dwarf-branches, the latter alone bearing the\r\nflowers.~--_Ribes_ (Figs. 490–492). The blades of the leaf are folded\r\nor rolled together in vernation. _R. alpinum_ is diœcious.\r\n\r\n   75 species; especially from the N. Temp. regions (especially\r\n   N. Am.).--The receptacle secretes honey on its inner surface.\r\n   The Gooseberry-flower is slightly protandrous, others are\r\n   homogamous; insect-and self-pollination are found. The following\r\n   are FRUIT BUSHES: _R. nigrum_ (Black Currant), _R. rubrum_\r\n   (Red Currant), _R. grossularia_ (Gooseberry), originating in\r\n   Northern Europe and Asia. ORNAMENTAL BUSHES: the North American\r\n   _R. aureum_ (Golden Currant) and _R. sanguineum_ (Blood-red\r\n   Currant), etc.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 493.--_Deutzia crenata._ Longitudinal section\r\n  of flower.]\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Hydrangeaceæ.= Shrubs, with simple, opposite leaves,\r\nwithout stipules; flowers generally epigynous, 4–5-merous (Fig.\r\n493).--_Hydrangea_ (_H. hortensia_, etc.). Shrubs from N. Am. and E.\r\nAsia; corolla often valvate. The inflorescence, as in the case of the\r\ninflorescence of _Viburnum opulus_ (Guelder Rose), has often irregular,\r\nlarge, but barren flowers at the circumference, whilst the others are\r\nmuch smaller, regular and ☿; the barren flowers are mostly 4-merous;\r\nin these cases it is the calyx which is large and petaloid, while the\r\nother parts of the flower are more or less suppressed. The branches of\r\nthe inflorescence appear to be partially devoid of floral-leaves, since\r\nthey are displaced upon the main axis.--_Philadelphus_; racemes (with\r\nterminal flower), sepals 4 (valvate), petals 4 (twisted), stamens many,\r\nand carpels 4 (opposite the petals), forming a 4-locular ovary. The\r\nnumerous stamens (20–30) occur by the splitting of the sepal-stamens\r\nand are often therefore placed in distinct bundles. Fruit a capsule.\r\n_Ph. coronaria_ (Syringa, Mock Orange-blossom), from S. Eur., is a\r\ncommon ornamental shrub, as also is _Deutzia_ (Fig. 493) from N. Am.\r\nand E. Asia. The latter has S5, P5, A5 + 5, G3.--About 70 species.\r\n\r\nOrder 5 (?). =Pittosporaceæ.= This order has its home especially in\r\nAustralia (90 species). The flower has S5, P5, A5 (episepalous), G2\r\n(3–5), most frequently a unilocular ovary with many ovules in 2 rows,\r\nborne on 2 parietal placentæ, or a bilocular ovary. Some have berries,\r\nothers capsules. _Pittosporum, Citriobatus, Sollya, Billardiera._\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Hamamelidaceæ.= Flowers more or less epigynous, with S4, P0\r\nor 4, 4 fertile sepal-stamens, and 4 barren petal-stamens, bilocular\r\novary with 1–2 ovules in each loculus. Fruit a capsule. _Hamamelis_:\r\none species in Japan and one in N. Am. _Fothergilla._ _Liquidambar_:\r\nmonœcious; flowers in capitula or spikes; ♂-flowers without perianth,\r\nstamens indefinite; ♀-flower: slight perianth, 2-locular ovary with\r\nmany ovules. OFFICINAL: “Styrax-balsam,” which is obtained by boiling\r\nthe bark of _Liq. orientalis_, from Asia Minor. _Liquidambar_ and\r\n_Parrotia_ are found as fossils in the Upper Oligocene; _Hamamelis_\r\nperhaps in the Chalk.\r\n\r\nFinally two orders with very reduced flowers are included in this\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nOrder 7. =Platanaceæ.= Trees, with large, scattered, palminerved and\r\nlobed leaves, and ochreate stipules; the buds are concealed in a hollow\r\nat the base of the petiole. The bark falls off in large scales. ♂-and\r\n♀-flowers (monœcious) in crowded, spherical inflorescences which are\r\nplaced at wide intervals on a terminal, thin, and pendulous axis. The\r\nflowers have an insignificant calyx and corolla; the ♂-flower has few\r\nstamens; ♀-flower, perigynous, with 4 free carpels, 1 _pendulous_,\r\n_orthotropous_ ovule in each. Fruit a nut; endosperm absent. 5 species;\r\nfrequently grown in avenues and parks. _P. occidentalis_ (N. Am.); _P.\r\norientalis_ (W. Asia.).\r\n\r\nOrder 8. =Podostemaceæ.= Aquatic plants, especially in swiftly\r\nrunning water, with somewhat of an Alga-like, Moss-like, or thalloid\r\nappearance; they show themselves in many ways to be adapted to their\r\nmode of life and situations (having a dorsiventral creeping stem, the\r\nflowers sunk in hollows, a formation of haptera upon the roots, and\r\nthalloid assimilating roots and thalloid stems, etc.). Tropical; 100\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 20. =Rosifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe leaves are scattered, stipulate, or have at least a well developed\r\nsheath, which is generally prolonged on each side into a free\r\nportion (“adnate stipules”). The flowers are regular, _perigynous_\r\nor _epigynous_. Calyx and corolla 5 (-4)-_merous_ with the usual\r\nposition. The corolla is always polypetalous. The stamens are present\r\nin very varying numbers (5–∞) and position, but _always_ placed in\r\n5-_or_ 10-_merous whorls_; they _are frequently_ 20 in 3 whorls (10\r\n+ 5 + 5; see Figs. 494, 502, 505); the nearer they are placed to the\r\ncircumference, the longer they are; they are generally _incurved in the\r\nbud, or even rolled up_. The number of the carpels is from 1–∞; in most\r\ncases all are _individually free_ (syncarp), and when they are united\r\nit is in every case with the ovaries only, whilst the _styles_ remain\r\nmore or less _free_ (_Pomaceæ_, species of _Spiræa_). The _seeds_ have\r\na straight embryo, and usually no endosperm.\r\n\r\n   The perianth and stamens are most frequently _perigynous_ on\r\n   the edge of the widened receptacle; its form varies between a\r\n   flat cupule and a long tube or a cup (Figs. 495, 496, 498, 499,\r\n   500); the carpels are situated on its base or inner surface, in\r\n   some instances on a central conical elongation of the floral\r\n   axis (Fig. 496). The carpels in _Pomaceæ_ also unite more or\r\n   less with the hollow receptacle, or this grows in and fills up\r\n   the space between the carpels, so that a more or less epigynous\r\n   flower is formed (Fig. 504).--The following numbers of _stamens_\r\n   occur: 5, 10 (in 1 whorl), 15 (10 + 5), 20 (10 + 5 + 5), 25 (10\r\n   + 10 + 5), 30-50 (in 10-merous whorls)--compare the diagrams.\r\n   The theoretical explanation of this relation of the 10-merous\r\n   whorls and their alternation with the 5-merous whorls is not\r\n   definitely determined; a splitting of the members of the\r\n   5-merous whorls may be supposed, but the development shows no\r\n   indication of this, and it is not supported in any other way.\r\n   Several genera have “_gynobasic_” styles, that is, the style\r\n   springs from the base of the ovary (Fig. 497 _A_, _B_).\r\n\r\n   The Rosifloræ are on one side closely related to the\r\n   Saxifragaceæ (especially through _Spiræa_) from which it is\r\n   difficult to separate them, and to the Myrtifloræ; on the other\r\n   side they are allied, through the Mimosaceæ with the large\r\n   number of stamens, and through the Amygdalaceæ with its single\r\n   carpel, to the Leguminosæ. The family begins with forms which\r\n   have many-seeded follicles, and passes on the one side to forms\r\n   with nuts and drupes in perigynous flowers, and on the other\r\n   side to the Pomaceæ.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Rosaceæ.= Herbs or shrubs, generally with compound leaves and\r\npersistent (adnate) stipules, flower _perigynous_, _gynœceum formed of\r\nmany free_ (therefore oblique) _carpels, syncarps_ with fruitlets of\r\nvarious kinds. The exceptions are noted under the genera.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 494.--Diagram of _Comarum palustre_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 495.--Flower of _Spiræa lanceolata_.]\r\n\r\n=1.= SPIRÆEÆ (Fig. 495) has 2–many ovules in each ovary, while in the\r\nother groups there is generally only 1, and never more than 2 ovules in\r\neach loculus. There are generally 5 _cyclic_ carpels and the fruit is\r\n5 _follicles_, which are not enclosed by the receptacle. The majority\r\nare shrubs. Stipules are often wanting.--_Spiræa_ (Meadow-Sweet).\r\nThe flowers are generally borne in richly flowered inflorescences\r\nof various forms. The carpels, in some species, unite together\r\nand form a _simple_ gynœceum with free styles (an approach to the\r\n_Pomaceæ_).--~Closely allied to _Spiræa_ are the East Asiatic shrubs:\r\n_Kerria japonica_, which has solitary flowers, in this country nearly\r\nalways double (the fruit a nut), and _Rhodotypos kerrioides_ which\r\nhas opposite leaves, a remarkable feature among the Rosifloræ; it has\r\na 4-merous flower, a well developed disc inside the andrœcium, and a\r\ndrupe. Closely allied also is _Gillenia_ (N. Am.) differing chiefly\r\nin the ascending ovules, _Spiræa_ having pendulous ovules, and a more\r\ntubular receptacle.~\r\n\r\n   The groups _Quillajeæ_ and _Neuradeæ_ form a transition from\r\n   _Spiræa_ to _Pomaceæ_. In the first group, which contains only\r\n   trees or shrubs with generally simple leaves, the carpels are\r\n   either free or united (into a capsule); in the second the\r\n   receptacle unites with the carpels, which are themselves often\r\n   united together; in this case, too, the fruit is a capsule.\r\n   _Quillaja_ (S. Am.); _Exochorda_ (China).\r\n\r\n=2.= POTENTILLEÆ (Figs. 494, 496, 497). The flower has an “_epicalyx_”\r\n(Fig. 494 _C_) alternating with the sepals and formed by their\r\nstipules which are united in pairs, and hence its leaves are often\r\nmore or less deeply bifid. The receptacle is cupular and often quite\r\ninsignificant. The sepals are valvate in the bud. The large number of\r\nfruitlets are _achenes_, borne on a well-developed convex portion of\r\nthe receptacle (~the Ranunculeæ resemble the Potentilleæ, but have\r\nno epicalyx, no enlarged receptacle, and spirally-placed stamens~).\r\nMost of the species are herbs with dichasial inflorescences, often\r\narranged in racemes.--_Potentilla_ (Cinquefoil). The achenes are\r\nborne on a _dry_, hairy receptacle; the style is situated towards\r\nthe apex of the ovary, and is not prolonged after flowering. Herbs\r\nwith digitate, in some, however, pinnate leaves, and generally yellow\r\nflowers.--_Comarum_ (Fig. 494) (Marsh Cinquefoil) forms, by its\r\nfleshy-spongy receptacle, a transition to the next genus.--_Fragaria_\r\n(Strawberry) (Fig. 496). The receptacle becomes finally fleshy,\r\ncoloured, and falls off (biologically it is a berry); the numerous\r\nfruitlets (drupes with thin pericarp) have basal styles (Fig. 497);\r\nleaves trifoliate; long, creeping runners.--_Geum_ (Avens) has a\r\nterminal style which after flowering elongates into a long beak, with\r\nthe apex (after the uppermost part has been thrown off) bent back into\r\na hook, thus furnishing a means of distribution for the fruits. Leaves\r\npinnate.--~_Dryas_ comprises 3 Arctic or Alpine species with simple\r\nleaves and solitary flowers, the calyx and corolla 8–9-merous, the\r\nfruit resembles that of _Geum_, but the styles become still longer and\r\nfeather-like (a flying apparatus).~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 496, 497.--_Fragaria vesca._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 496.--Longitudinal section of flower.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 497.--A carpel, entire, and in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n=3.= RUBEÆ. _Rubus_ (Bramble) has the same form of receptacle as the\r\n_Potentilleæ_, but _no epicalyx_; _the fruitlets are drupes_, not\r\nenclosed by the persistent calyx. Most frequently shrubs or undershrubs\r\nwith prickles (emergences), glandular bristles and compound leaves.\r\nIn the Raspberry (_R. idæus_) the fruitlets unite together and detach\r\nthemselves from the receptacle.\r\n\r\n=4.= ROSEÆ. _Rosa_; the receptacle is hollow, ovoid and contracted\r\nbeneath the insertion of the calyx (Fig. 498), ultimately _fleshy_\r\nand _coloured_; it encloses a large number of fruitlets which are\r\nachenes as hard as stones (“hip,” biologically a berry).--Shrubs with\r\nimparipinnate leaves and adnate stipules. ~The sepals show clearly the\r\norder of their development (a divergence of 2/5), the two outer ones on\r\nboth sides are lobed, the third one on one side only, and the two last,\r\nwhose edges are covered by the others, are not lobed at all. _Prickles_\r\n(emergences) are generally present and in some species are placed in\r\nregular order, being found immediately below each leaf (usually two)\r\nalthough at somewhat varying heights.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 498.--Longitudinal section of flower of\r\n  _Rosa_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 499, 500.--_Agrimonia eupatoria._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 499.--Flower in longitudinal section.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 500.--Fruit and receptacle in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n=5.= AGRIMONIEÆ. The receptacle is more or less cup- or bell-shaped,\r\nand almost closed at the mouth; it is persistent and envelopes the\r\n_nut-like fruitlets_, but is _dry_, and in some species hard, the\r\nfruitlets being firmly attached to it. In biological connection\r\nwith this the number of the carpels is generally only 1 or 2, and\r\nthe whole becomes a _false nut_ (Fig. 500). Herbs.--_Agrimonia_\r\n(Agrimony; Figs. 499, 500); the perianth is 5-merous, stamens 5–20.\r\nThe receptacle bears externally, on the upper surface, a number of\r\nhooked bristles which serve as a means of distribution for the 1–2\r\nachenes which are enclosed in it, and hence the entire flower finally\r\nfalls off. The inflorescence is a long upright raceme. ~These bristles\r\nare arranged in whorls of 5 and 10, of which the uppermost alternate\r\nwith the sepals.~--_Alchemilla_ (Ladies-mantle; Fig. 501) has 8 green\r\nperianth-leaves in two whorls (some authorities consider the four outer\r\nas an epicalyx, and the flower therefore apetalous), and 4 stamens\r\n_alternating with the innermost whorl_. There is only one carpel with a\r\n_basal_ style and capitate stigma. The flowers are small and greenish,\r\nthe filaments jointed. The anthers open by one extrorse cleft. The\r\nleaf-sheath entirely envelops the stem; the leaves are palminerved.\r\n_A. aphanes_ has often only 1–2 stamens. ~The following genera, with\r\n4-merous flowers borne in short spikes or capitula, are allied to this\r\ngroup. _Sanguisorba_ has entomophilous, ☿-flowers with 4(-20) stamens,\r\n1 carpel; stigma papillose.--_Poterium_; spike or capitulum, the\r\nuppermost flowers are ♀, the lowermost ♂, and some intermediate ones ☿\r\n(the order of opening is not always centripetal); S4, P0, A20–30, G2,\r\nthe long styles having brush-like stigmas (wind-pollination). Leaves\r\nimparipinnate.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 501.--Flower of _Alchemilla_ in longitudinal\r\n  section.]\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. A yellow ring on the inner side of the receptacle,\r\n   inside the stamens, serves as a nectary when any honey\r\n   is formed; this, for instance, is not the case in _Rosa,\r\n   Agrimonia_, _Spiræa ulmaria_, _S. filipendula_, _S. aruncus_,\r\n   etc., to which the insects (especially flies and bees) are\r\n   allured by the quantity of pollen. Homogamy and slight\r\n   protogyny are frequent, in many instances self-pollination\r\n   also is finally possible. _Poterium_, with the long-haired\r\n   stigma, is wind-pollinated.--About 550 (1100?) species,\r\n   especially in northern temperate regions.--USES. OFFICINAL:\r\n   the petals of _Rosa centifolia_ and _gallica_, the fruits of\r\n   the Raspberry (_Rubus idæus_), the rhizome of _Geum urbanum_,\r\n   the flowers of the Koso-tree (_Hagenia abyssinica_ or _Brayera\r\n   anthelmintica_).--The bark of _Quillaja saponaria_ (Chili) is\r\n   used as soap and contains _saponin_. “Attar of Roses” from\r\n   _Rosa damascena_, _centifolia_ and other species, especially\r\n   from the southern slopes of the Balkans. Many species and\r\n   varieties of Roses are ORNAMENTAL plants: from S. Europe, _Rosa\r\n   lutea_ (the Yellow Rose), _R. gallica_ (the French Rose) and\r\n   _R. rubrifolia_; from W. Asia, _R. centifolia_, of which the\r\n   Moss Roses (_R. muscosa_ and _cristata_) are varieties, and _R.\r\n   damascena_; from India and N. Africa, _R. moschata_ (the Musk\r\n   Rose); from China, _R. indica_ (Tea Rose) etc., besides the\r\n   native species and the varieties which have been derived from\r\n   them. In addition, _Kerria japonica_, species of _Potentilla_,\r\n   _Rubus odoratus_ from N. Am., and many species of _Spiræa_ from\r\n   South-eastern Europe and N. Am. ESCULENT: the “hips” of _R.\r\n   mollissima_, _R. pomifera_, etc.; the fruits of _Rubus_-species:\r\n   Raspberry (_R. idæus_), Cloudberry (_R. chamæmorus_), Blackberry\r\n   (_R. fruticosus_), etc.; of _Fragaria_-species (_F. vesca_,\r\n   _collina_, _grandiflora_, etc).\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Amygdalaceæ.= Trees or shrubs with rosaceous flowers;\r\nleaves simple with caducous stipules; a regular, _perigynous_ flower,\r\nthe receptacle being partly thrown off by a circular slit; sepals\r\n5, petals 5, stamens 20–30; _gynœceum simple, formed of 1 carpel_\r\n(hence oblique, Fig. 502), with terminal style and 2 pendulous ovules,\r\nripening into a _drupe_ (Fig. 503).--The leaves are penninerved and\r\nfrequently have _glands_ on the stalks and edges; _thorns_ (modified\r\nbranches) often occur, _i.e._ dwarf-branches, which, after producing\r\na few leaves, terminate their growth in a thorn (_e.g._ _Prunus\r\nspinosa_). ~The vernation of the _foliage-leaves_ varies in the\r\ndifferent genera; in the Almond, Peach, Cherry, and Bird-Cherry they\r\nare folded; in the Apricot, Plum, Sloe and Bullace, rolled together. In\r\nsome the flowers unfold before the leaves (_Amygdalus_, _Armeniaca_).\r\nThat the gynœceum is formed of 1 carpel is evident in this as in other\r\ninstances (_e.g._ in the Leguminosæ, which are closely related to this\r\norder), from the fact that the carpel is oblique, and has only one\r\nplane of symmetry, and similarly in the fruit there is a longitudinal\r\ngroove on one side which indicates the ventral suture. It is only\r\nexceptionally that both ovules are developed. In abnormal instances\r\nmore than 1 carpel is developed.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 502.--Diagram of _Prunus virginiana_.]\r\n\r\n=A.= FRUIT HAIRY: _Amygdalus_ (_A. communis_, Almond-tree) has a dry\r\npulp which is detached irregularly, when ripe, from the wrinkled,\r\ngrooved, ovoid and somewhat compressed stone.--_Persica_ (_P.\r\nvulgaris_, Peach-tree) differs from the Almond in having a juicy pulp,\r\nnot detachable from the stone, which is deeply grooved and has pits\r\nin the grooves (Fig. 503). (~The name of the genus is derived from\r\nPersia, though it is a native of China.~).--_Armeniaca_ (_A. vulgaris_,\r\nApricot) has a hairy, velvety fruit, but the stone is smooth and has\r\ntwo ribs along one of the edges; the pulp is juicy. (~The generic name\r\nhas been given on the incorrect assumption that it was a native of\r\nArmenia; its home is China.~)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 503.--Fruit of the Peach. The pulp is cut\r\n  through so that the stone is visible.]\r\n\r\n=B.= FRUIT GLABROUS (_i.e._ without hairs): _Prunus_ (Plum) has a\r\nglabrous fruit with bluish bloom; the stone is compressed, smooth or\r\nwrinkled. The flowers are borne solitarily or in couples, and open\r\nbefore or at the same time as the leaves; they are borne on shoots\r\nwithout foliage-leaves.--_Cerasus_ (Cherry) has a glabrous, spherical\r\nfruit, without bloom, and a spherical stone. The flowers are situated\r\nin 2–many-flowered umbels or racemes, and open at the same time as the\r\nleaves or a little before them. ~_Long-stalked_ flowers in _umbels_\r\nare found in _C. avium_ (Wild Cherry), _C. vulgaris_ (the cultivated\r\nCherry, from Western Asia); _racemes_ at the apex of leaf-bearing\r\nbranches and small spherical fruits are found in _C. padus_ (Bird\r\nCherry), _C. virginiana_, _C. laurocerasus_ (Cherry-laurel), _C.\r\nmahaleb_.~\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. _Prunus spinosa_ (Sloe, Blackthorn) is protogynous,\r\n   but the stamens are developed before the stigma withers. Honey\r\n   is secreted by the receptacle. _Cerasus padus_ (Bird-Cherry)\r\n   agrees in some measure with _P. spinosa_. In the flowers of\r\n   the Plum and Cherry the stamens and stigma are developed\r\n   simultaneously and self pollination seems general; the\r\n   stigma, however, overtops the inner stamens and thus promotes\r\n   cross-pollination.--DISTRIBUTION. 114 species in the N. Temp,\r\n   zone; few in the warmer regions; the majority from W. Asia. _C.\r\n   vulgaris_, from the regions of the Caspian; _Prunus spinosa_,\r\n   _insititia_ (Bullace), _domestica_ (Plum, from the Caucasus,\r\n   Persia).--USES, principally as fruit-trees: Cherry, Plum,\r\n   Apricot, etc.; “Almonds” are the seeds of _Amygdalus communis_\r\n   (W. Mediterranean), “bitter,” “sweet,” and “shell” almonds are\r\n   from different varieties, the latter being remarkable for the\r\n   thin, brittle stone. In the majority of species and in almost\r\n   all parts of the plant (especially the bark, seed and leaves)\r\n   is found the glycoside, _amygdalin_, which forms prussic acid.\r\n   Many form _gum_, and the seeds have _fatty oils_ (“Almond\r\n   oil”). OFFICINAL: the seeds and oil of _Amygdalus communis_,\r\n   and the fruit of the Cherry; in other countries also the leaves\r\n   of _C. laurocerasus_.--The stems of _Cerasus mahaleb_ are\r\n   used for pipes. Ornamental Shrubs: _Amygdalus nana_, _Cerasus\r\n   laurocerasus_.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. _Chrysobalanaceæ._ Tropical Amygdalaceæ with\r\n   zygomorphic flower and gynobasic style. 200 species; especially\r\n   Am. and Asia. _Chrysobalanus icaco_ (Cocoa-plum) is cultivated\r\n   on account of its fruit (Am.)\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Pomaceæ.= Trees and shrubs, most frequently with simple\r\nleaves and caducous stipules. The flowers (Fig. 505) have 5 sepals, 5\r\npetals and generally 20 stamens (10 + 5 + 5, or 10 + 10 + 5). There are\r\nfrom 1–5 _carpels_, which unite entirely or to some extent with each\r\nother, and with the hollow, fleshy receptacle (the _flower_ becoming\r\n_epigynous_), (Figs. 505, 506, 507). The carpels are nearly always\r\nfree on the ventral sutures, rarely free at the sides also. The whole\r\nouter portion of the fruit becomes fleshy, but the portions of the\r\npericarp surrounding the loculi (endocarp) are most frequently formed\r\nof sclerenchymatous cells, and are more or less firm (the “core”). The\r\nnature of the fruit varies, according to the thickness and hardness\r\nof the endocarp, being either a “berry” or a “drupe” (see _A_ and\r\n_B_). When the endocarp is thin and parchment-like, the fruit has the\r\ncharacteristics of a berry, each of the 5 loculi generally present\r\ncontaining several seeds; but when this is hard the fruit resembles a\r\ndrupe, only one seed is developed in each loculus, and the number of\r\nthe loculi is reduced to one or two. There are nearly always 2 ovules\r\nin the loculi of the ovary, but in _Cydonia_ there are a large number\r\nin 2 rows. In the genera which have stones, only one seed is developed\r\nin each stone. The genera are distinguished mainly in accordance with\r\nthe kind of fruit and the number of ovules and seeds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 504.--Longitudinal and transverse section\r\n  through the flowers of _A_, _B_ _Cotoneaster_; _C_ _Cydonia_;\r\n  _D_ _Malus communis_; _E_ _Raphiolepis_; _F_ _Cydonia_; _G_\r\n  _Mespilus_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 505.--Floral diagram of _Mespilus germanica_.]\r\n\r\n=A.= SORBEÆ. THE ENDOCARP IS PARCHMENT-LIKE OR PAPERY (drupe, with thin\r\nstone or berry).\r\n\r\n1. _Pyrus_ and _Cydonia_; carpels completely embedded in the cup-like\r\nreceptacle, styles always free.--_Pyrus_: the fruit is glabrous,\r\nand has only a small calyx, withering or deciduous, and a 5-locular\r\novary with at most 2 ascending ovules in each loculus (Fig. 504\r\n_D_). The large flowers are situated in few-flowered umbels or\r\ncorymbs. ~_P. communis_ (Pear; free styles, Fig. 507; it has the\r\nwell-known pear-shaped fruit; the core is reduced to several groups\r\nof sclerenchymatous cells embedded in the pulp, the leaf-stalk is as\r\nlong as the blade).~--_Cydonia_ (Quince) has a hairy fruit with _many\r\nseeds in 2 rows_ in each loculus of the endocarp (Figs. 504 _C_, _F_;\r\n506); the testa of these seeds is mucilaginous. _C. vulgaris_, large,\r\nterminal flowers on lateral branches, and large leaf-like, persistent\r\nsepals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 506.--_Cydonia vulgaris._ Longitudinal\r\n  section of fruit.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 507.--Longitudinal section of Pear flower.]\r\n\r\n2. _Malus_ and _Amelanchier_ (_Aronia_); carpels free on the ventral\r\nedge; styles united. _Malus communis_ (Apple) the fruit is “umbilicate”\r\nat the base; no sclerenchymatous cells in the pulp; styles united at\r\nthe base (Fig. 504 _D_); leaf-stalk shorter than the blade. _Sorbus_\r\n(Mountain-ash) differs only in having a 2–3-locular fruit with\r\nextremely thin endocarp. Cymose inflorescences in umbellate cymes.\r\n~_S. aucuparia_ has pinnate leaves, _S. aria_ (White-beam) and other\r\nspecies have simple leaves.--_Amelanchier_ (the Service-tree) has a\r\nfalse divisional wall springing from the dorsal suture, and more or\r\nless projecting into each of the loculi of the ovary; _Raphiolepis_\r\n(Fig. 504 _E_) has racemes and a juicy berry; _Eriobotrya japonica_\r\n(Loquat).~\r\n\r\n=B.= CRATÆGEÆ. THE ENDOCARP IS HARD AND BONY (“drupes,” generally\r\nwith several, sometimes, however, with only 1–2 stones, rarely one\r\nmultilocular stone; only 1 seed in each of the loculi).--_Cratægus_\r\n(Hawthorn, May). There are 1–5 stones in the spherical or ovoid fruit.\r\nThe disc, found on the apex of the fruit, inside the small, withered\r\ncalyx, is small (much less than the transverse section of the fruit).\r\nShrubs with thorns (branches) and moderately large flowers borne in\r\ncorymbs.--_Mespilus_ (Medlar) differs from the last-named only in\r\nhaving a _large disc_ at the apex of the fruit, inside the large,\r\n_leaf-like sepals_, _i.e._ almost equal to the greatest diameter of the\r\nfruit. The flowers are solitary and terminal.--_Cotoneaster_ is chiefly\r\ndistinguished from the others by its syncarps, the 2–5 carpels (and\r\nstones) being free from one another, and only united to the receptacle\r\nby a larger or smaller portion of their dorsal surface (Figs. 504 _A_,\r\n_B_). Small shrubs with leathery leaves, generally covered with white,\r\nfelted hairs on the lower surface, and with small flowers; the fruit is\r\nred or black.\r\n\r\n   Pear, Apple, Mountain Ash and Hawthorn have protogynous\r\n   flowers which secrete honey, and are conspicuous to ensure\r\n   insect pollination.--180 species; in the northern temperate\r\n   regions.--Pear and Apple are especially cultivated as fruit\r\n   trees in a number of varieties; the Paradise Apple (_Pyrus\r\n   baccata_); especially in southern countries also the Quince\r\n   (from N. Persia and the Caucasian districts), Medlar and\r\n   _Amelanchier vulgaris_. _Malus pumila_ (Caucasus,\r\n   Altai) and _M. dasyphylla_ (Orient, S. Eur.) are regarded\r\n   as primitive forms of the Apple-tree; _M. sylvestris_,\r\n   which grows wild in European forests, appears to have been less\r\n   used. The early Lake-dwellers in Switzerland had the apple-tree\r\n   both wild and cultivated.--The original form of the Pear is\r\n   supposed to be _Pyrus achras_ (Central Asia).--Many of\r\n   the species of _Cratægus_, some with double flowers, and\r\n   _Pyrus (Chænomeles) japonica_, with brilliant red flowers,\r\n   are cultivated as ornamental shrubs. OFFICINAL: Quince\r\n   pips, on account of the mucilaginous testa.--The fruits contain\r\n   free organic acids and sugar; prussic acid may be obtained from\r\n   the seeds. The wood of the Pear-tree is used in manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 21. =Leguminosæ.=\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic feature is, that the _gynœceum is 1-locular_\r\nand formed of _1 carpel, the ventral suture of which is turned\r\nposteriorly_. The fruit, in most instances, is a _pod_ (legume),\r\nwhich opens generally along both sutures, the two valves twisting\r\nmore or less in opposite directions. ~In other instances it opens\r\nalong one suture only, or as a pyxidium (Red Clover), or it is\r\nindehiscent, in which case it is more or less berry-like (_e.g._ the\r\nTamarind, Carob-bean), or it is a drupe (_e.g._ the Tonquin-bean), or\r\na 1–few-seeded nut (_e.g._ _Melilotus_), or a lomentum, which divides\r\ntransversely into as many joints as there are seeds (_Ornithopus_, see\r\nFig. 513).~\r\n\r\nThe inflorescences belong to the _centripetal_ type (_i.e._\r\nindefinite); cymes do not occur. The flowers are _zygomorphic_, with\r\nvertical plane of symmetry, seldom regular; _5-merous_ with but a few\r\nexceptions, ☿, and slightly _perigynous_. The following diagram is the\r\nmost general (Fig. 511): 5 sepals, with the _unpaired sepal median\r\nand anterior_, 5 petals, 5 + 5 stamens, all in alternating whorls, 1\r\ncarpel. The calyx is most frequently gamosepalous, the gynœceum is\r\nnarrowed down at the base to a short stalk and, in the majority, is\r\nmore or less bent. The seed is most frequently kidney-shaped, with\r\na smooth, hard and shining testa, the hilum being very distinct.\r\n_Endosperm is wanting_, or is reduced to a thin layer, which is of\r\nservice when the seed swells during germination. The vegetative parts\r\nhave these features in common, namely, the _leaves are scattered,\r\nstipulate_, and almost always _compound_. Peculiar _sleep-movements_\r\nand _sensitiveness_ are found in some, chiefly in the Mimosas. Many,\r\nprobably all, Leguminosæ have _small tubercles on their roots_ which\r\nare produced by a kind of bacterium, and assist in the assimilation\r\nof free nitrogen. Spontaneous movements are exhibited by _Desmodium\r\ngyrans_ (Telegraph-plant).\r\n\r\n   This family is closely allied to the Rosifloræ, with which it\r\n   agrees in the scattered leaves, the presence of stipules, the\r\n   generally 5-merous and most frequently perigynous flowers with\r\n   eucyclic stamens, and the absence of endosperm. _Amygdalaceæ_\r\n   and _Chrysobalanaceæ_, with solitary carpels, approach on one\r\n   side to the Leguminosæ, among which genera with drupes are also\r\n   found; _Mimosaceæ_, with their many stamens, form a connecting\r\n   link on the other side. In this respect the Mimosa-genus\r\n   _Affonsea_, and certain Cæsalpineæ and Swartzieæ, are of special\r\n   interest in having more than one carpel (syncarp), a condition\r\n   which is sometimes met with abnormally in other Leguminosæ, as\r\n   well as in Amygdalaceæ. About 7,000 species of the Leguminosæ\r\n   are known.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Cæsalpiniaceæ.= These are _leguminous plants with straight\r\nembryo and a flower which is not papilionaceous and has not the\r\nsame æstivation_ (Figs. 508–510); but in reality there is not a\r\nsingle characteristic which absolutely distinguishes them from the\r\nPapilionaceæ.--The majority are arborescent; the leaves as a rule\r\nare pinnate or bipinnate. The flower is 5-merous, most frequently\r\nperigynous and slightly zygomorphic; the calyx is free or gamosepalous,\r\nthe corolla polypetalous with _ascending imbricate æstivation_ (_i.e._\r\nthe two lowest petals envelop the lateral ones, and these again the\r\nposterior; Fig. 508); 10 _free stamens_; fruit various.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 508–510.--_Cassia floribunda._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 508.--Floral diagram.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 509.--Flower.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 510.--The same in long. sect.]\r\n\r\n_Cassia_ (Figs. 508–510) is the largest genus (about 200 species); it\r\nhas an almost hypogynous, zygomorphic flower with 5 free sepals and\r\npetals; of the 10 stamens the 3 posterior are generally barren, the\r\nothers are of very unequal length and open at the apex by _pores_ (Fig.\r\n509). In some (the _Senna_ group) the fruit is a flat, short, thin,\r\ndehiscing pod; in others (_Cathartocarpus_) it is round, long, woody\r\nor fleshy, indehiscent, and divided internally by more or less fleshy\r\ntransverse walls into as many cells as there are seeds.--The following\r\nalso have DEHISCENT FRUITS: _Bauhinia_ (often lianes, tropical climbers\r\nwith tendrils [stem-structures] and anomalous stems), _Copaifera_,\r\n_Hæmatoxylon_ (whose pod does not dehisce along the suture, but\r\nlaterally), _Cercis_ (simple leaves; the corolla resembles that of\r\nthe Papilionaceæ, but the posterior petal is the smallest, and is\r\nenveloped by the 2 lateral ones, which are enveloped in their turn by\r\nthe 2 anterior).--FRUIT INDEHISCENT: _Tamarindus indica_; the pod is\r\nalmost round, often a little abstricted between the seeds; the wall\r\nis formed by a thin, brittle external layer, enclosing an acid pulp;\r\nwell-developed septa are present, between the seeds; the most internal\r\nlayer is parchment-like. Calyx 4-merous by the coalescence of 2 sepals.\r\nOnly 3 fertile stamens.--_Ceratonia siliqua_ (Carob-bean, Locusts);\r\nthe pod is long, compressed, with thick sutures, and has a wall, the\r\ncentral part of which is more or less leathery, fleshy and sweet;\r\nthere are transverse septa between the seeds, as in the Tamarind.\r\nEmbryo greenish in endosperm. The flower is without a corolla, 5\r\nstamens.--_Pterogyne_ (winged fruit), etc.--KRAMERIEÆ with _Krameria_\r\nis an anomalous group.\r\n\r\n   DISTRIBUTION. 80 genera, with 740 species; almost exclusively\r\n   in the Tropics. The Carob-tree and _Cercis_ grow in the\r\n   Mediterranean basin. The largest and most widely distributed\r\n   genus is _Cassia_, which is found as trees, shrubs, and weeds\r\n   in all tropical countries. The order has many important\r\n   uses to mankind. MEDICINAL: the leaves and pods of _Cassia\r\n   acutifolia_ and _angustifolia_ (officinal, Senna-leaves),\r\n   the fruit-pulp of the _Cassia_-sub-genus, _Cathartocarpus_.\r\n   Rhatany root from _Krameria triandra_ (Peru, officinal).\r\n   _Balsam_ is extracted from a number of _Copaifera_-species\r\n   (Balsam of Copaiba) from S. Am. (officinal), and from _Hymenæa_\r\n   (Copal balsam), _Trachylobium_ and others. _Edible fruits_ are\r\n   obtained especially from the Carob-tree (from the East) and\r\n   the Tamarind (officinal). The heart-wood of several species of\r\n   _Cæsalpinia_, such as _C. brasiliensis_ (the Pernambuco-tree),\r\n   _echinata_ (Red-tree), and _sappan_, yield _dyes_; _Hæmatoxylon_\r\n   (_H. campechianum_, Logwood), _Copaifera bracteata_\r\n   (Amarant-tree).--_Timber_ is obtained from many (_Melanoxylon_\r\n   and others). In Europe they are of little importance as\r\n   ornamental plants, these being confined principally to the\r\n   species of _Gleditschia_ (_G. triacantha_, from N. Am.) and\r\n   _Cercis_ (the Judas-tree, _C. siliquastrum_, S. Eur.), which\r\n   are cultivated in gardens; but in tropical gardens beautiful\r\n   flowering species, _e.g._ of _Cassia_, _Poinciana_, _Brownea_,\r\n   are found, and the most beautiful of all ornamental plants, the\r\n   Indian _Amherstia nobilis_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 511.--Diagram of _Faba vulgaris_: _f_ the\r\n  standard; _v_ the wings; _k_ the keel.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Papilionaceæ.= The flower (Figs. 511, 512) is _strongly\r\nzygomorphic_ and somewhat perigynous (Fig. 512 _B_; most frequently\r\nmore on one side than the other). The calyx is _gamosepalous_ and\r\npersistent. The polypetalous corolla has _descending_ imbricate\r\næstivation, the posterior, large leaf, the _standard_ (Figs. 511 _f_;\r\n512 _B’_, _e_), _covering in the bud_ the two lateral ones, the _wings_\r\n(Figs. 511 _v_; 512 _B’_, _a_), which again cover the two anterior;\r\nthese are united in the form of a boat, the _keel_ (_k_ and _c_); the\r\nwings and the two petals of the keel are very unsymmetrical. That the\r\nkeel is formed of two petals is seen by its position (in front of one\r\nsepal) and by the two often more or less free claws. The 10 (5 + 5)\r\n_stamens_ (monadelphous) _are either all united into one bundle, or\r\ninto two bundles_ (diadelphous), the posterior one being free (Fig. 512\r\n_C_). The ovules are _curved_ and _also the embryo_ (Fig. 512 _G_),\r\nespecially the hypocotyl, so that the radicle assumes a position close\r\nto the edge of the thick, fleshy cotyledons. Endosperm wanting; the\r\ncotyledons are very rich in proteid reserve material. The forms of the\r\nfruit and exceptions are described under the genera.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 512.--_Pisum sativum_: _A_ entire flower; _B_\r\n  in longitudinal section; _C_ gynœceum and stamens; _D_ gynœceum;\r\n  _B’_ corolla dissected, _e_ standard, _a_, _a_ wings, _c_ keel;\r\n  _D_ seed opened to show the cotyledons (_c_), the radicle (_r_),\r\n  the plumule (_g_); _E_ fruit (legume); _F_ seed.]\r\n\r\n   _Geocarpic_ fruits, _i.e._ those which penetrate the soil during\r\n   their development and ripen underground, are found in _e.g._\r\n   _Arachis hypogæa_ (see page 472), _Trifolium subterraneum_,\r\n   _Vicia amphicarpæa_. _Germination_ takes place in various ways.\r\n   In the majority the cotyledons are raised above the ground as\r\n   green, leaf-like bodies; in the Vicieæ they remain thick and\r\n   white, and are always enclosed in the testa, and are therefore\r\n   never able to take part in the work of assimilation; in species\r\n   of _Phaseolus_, on the other hand, they are raised well above\r\n   the ground and become green, but remain however thick and fleshy.\r\n\r\n   =1, 2.= The two groups PODALYRIEÆ (the majority of the genera\r\n   are Australian) and SOPHOREÆ (_Sophora_, _Edwardsia_, etc.),\r\n   represent the oldest type, as they have 10 _free stamens_ and so\r\n   form the transition to the Cæsalpiniaceæ. Nearly all are trees\r\n   and shrubs.\r\n\r\n=3.= ASTRAGALEÆ. Herbs or shrubs, less frequently trees, with\r\n_imparipinnate_ leaves (without tendrils). The flowers are\r\ngenerally borne in racemes or spikes. Stamens monadelphous or\r\ndiadelphous.--_Astragalus_ (Milk-Vetch) has the legume incompletely\r\ndivided longitudinally into 2 loculi by a septum formed by the incurved\r\ndorsal suture. Diadelphous.--_Glycyrrhiza_ (Liquorice); _Colutea_\r\n(Bladder-Senna) from S. Europe; _Robinia_ (the false Acacia) with\r\nthorny stipules; _Indigofera_ (the Indigo plant); _Amorpha_ (which has\r\nonly one petal, namely the standard, and the fruit a nut), _Caragana_,\r\n_Wistaria_ (a climbing shrub), _Galega_. _Carmichælia australis_, when\r\nold, produces flat branches with scale-like leaves.\r\n\r\n=4.= VICIEÆ. _Climbing herbs_ with _paripinnate_ leaves, the midrib\r\nending in a point or frequently in a _tendril_, which generally is\r\nbranched, representing lateral veins without mesophyll; stamens\r\ndiadelphous; the cotyledons remain underground on germination.--_Vicia_\r\n(Vetch) has a filamentous style, hairy towards the tip, and a\r\npod with many seeds; climbing by means of tendrils; the leaves\r\nhave many leaflets.--_Faba_ (_F. vulgaris_, Horse-bean) is erect,\r\nwithout tendrils; its pod is thick with spongy septa between the\r\nseeds.--_Ervum_ (Lentil) has a pod with only 1–2 seeds, and sweeping\r\nhairs (stylar-brush) on the inner side of the style.--_Pisum_ (Pea;\r\nFig. 512) has very large stipules, the bent style has a hollow groove\r\non the anterior side. _P. sativum_ (Common Pea), _P. arvense_ (Grey\r\nPea).--_Lathyrus_ (Sweet Pea) generally has an angular, winged stem and\r\nmost frequently only a few pairs of leaflets. The style is flattened,\r\nwith sweeping hairs on the back. ~In _L. aphaca_ the stipules alone\r\nare developed into foliage-leaves, while the remainder of the leaf is\r\nmodified into a tendril.~--_Cicer_ has a nearly straight embryo and\r\nimparipinnate leaves with dentate or incised leaflets. _C. arietinus_\r\n(Chick-pea).--~_Abrus_ (_precatorius_, etc.); the seeds (“Crab’s eyes,”\r\n“Paternoster peas,” “Jequirity”) are scarlet with a black spot round\r\nthe hilum.~\r\n\r\n=5.= PHASEOLEÆ. Herbs, twining or erect, but not climbing by tendrils;\r\nthe leaves are imparipinnate, generally _ternate_, and bear small,\r\nlinear bodies resembling stipules at the base of the stalks of the\r\nleaflets. The inflorescences are most frequently compound, groups of\r\nfew flowers being situated on short, nodose, lateral axes borne on a\r\nlonger stem. On germination the cotyledons are raised a considerable\r\ndistance above the ground, and become greenish, but do not become\r\nleaf-like; in _P. multiflorus_ they remain underground. Stamens as\r\nin the Vetches.--_Phaseolus_ (Kidney-bean): the keel with the stamen\r\nand style is spirally _twisted_ (to the right). Herbs, twining to the\r\nleft.--~The “Calabar-bean” (_Physostigma venenosum_), _Erythrina_,\r\n_Clitoria_, _Glycine_, _Soja_, _Mucuna_, _Apios_, _Canavalia_, _Vigna_,\r\n_Dolichos_, _Cajanus_, _Rhynchosia_, etc.~\r\n\r\n=6.= TRIFOLIEÆ (CLOVERS). Herbs with _ternate_ leaves, the leaflets\r\nare often dentate with the veins prolonged into the teeth; stamens\r\ndiadelphous; fruit 1-locular, 1–few-seeded, pyxidium-like, irregularly\r\ndehiscent, or more frequently a _nut_. The flowers are generally borne\r\nin capitula, racemes, or spikes.--_Trifolium_ (Clover). The corolla\r\nis gamopetalous. The calyx persists, together with the corolla, round\r\nthe ripe fruit. The inflorescence is a spike, capitulum or capitate\r\numbel; the leaves are ternate, and have adnate stipules.--_Medicago_\r\n(Medick). The corolla falls off after flowering; fruit curved like a\r\nsickle or spirally twisted; it is a nut, and opens with difficulty.\r\nLeaves ternate.--_Melilotus_ (Melilot) has a small, spherical or\r\nlanceolate, thick and wrinkled fruit, which as a rule is indehiscent.\r\nThe inflorescence is a raceme, often long, or a spike, sometimes a\r\ncapitulum. Leaves ternate.--_Ononis_ (Rest-harrow) differs in having\r\nmonadelphous stamens and in being more shrub-like and bushy, and in\r\nhaving a normal, 2-valved pod, by which characteristic it approaches\r\nthe Genisteæ. The flowers are generally rose-coloured, solitary, or in\r\nfew-flowered racemes in the leaf-axils. Thorns (branches) are often\r\npresent; the leaves are compound with only one small leaflet (the\r\nterminal one), or ternate with adnate stipules.\r\n\r\n=7.= LOTEÆ. Herbs with ternate or imparipinnate leaves, with entire\r\nleaflets. In the latter case, when the lowest pair of leaflets is\r\nplaced quite close to the sheath, the stalk is wanting, and apparently\r\na trifoliate leaf with large stipules is developed. Flowers in\r\nan umbel or capitulum. Stamens monadelphous or diadelphous, the\r\nfilaments (either all of them, or only the 5 sepal-stamens) are\r\nwidened at the top.--_Lotus_ (Bird’s-foot-trefoil) has a long, round\r\npod.--_Tetragonolobus._--_Anthyllis_ (Lady’s-finger); the fruit is\r\na nut, which is distributed by the wind by means of the membranous,\r\nbladder-like calyx, which completely encloses and falls off with it.\r\n\r\n=8.= GENISTEÆ. The majority are shrubs or trees with apparently simple\r\nleaves, _i.e._ compound leaves with only one leaflet (the terminal\r\nleaflet), or ternate leaves; the stipules in most instances are very\r\nsmall or are entirely wanting; stamens monadelphous.--_Genista_\r\n(Dyer’s-weed) has apparently simple leaves; the branches often\r\nterminate in a thorn. ~The strongly-winged stems in _G. sagittalis_\r\nare its most important organs of assimilation. _Bossiæa rufa_\r\nhas flat branches, its leaves being reduced to small, pointed\r\nstipules.~--_Sarothamnus_ (Broom) has switch-like, angular branches\r\nand often both the apparently simple and ternate leaves on the same\r\nshoot; style spirally rolled.--_Cytisus_ (Laburnum). _Ulex_ (Furze;\r\n~in _U. europæus_, the seedlings bear a few foliage leaves, but\r\nthe leaves succeeding these are modified into thorns~); _Spartium_;\r\n_Crotalaria_, etc.--_Lupinus_ (Lupin) is allied to this group; it has\r\na thick, often somewhat fleshy pod, and digitate leaves with adnate\r\nstipules.--_Retama._\r\n\r\n=9.= HEDYSAREÆ are especially recognised by having the ovary divided\r\nby transverse septa into as many cells as there are seeds, the fruit\r\nthus becomes a _lomentum_, dehiscing transversely into nut-like joints\r\n(Fig. 513).--_Ornithopus_ (Bird’s-foot); _Coronilla_; _Hippocrepis_;\r\n_Onobrychis_ (Sainfoin) has a fruit with only 1 joint (_i.e._ a\r\n1-seeded nut); _Desmodium_; _Alhagi_; _Hedysarum_, etc.--_Arachis\r\nhypogæa_ (Earth-nut) has a pod which is abstricted between the seeds,\r\nand is indehiscent, but is not multilocular nor a true lomentum; it is\r\nreticulately wrinkled externally, and ripens underground; the basal\r\npart of the ovary is prolonged after flowering, attaining a length of\r\nseveral inches, and buries the young fruit in the soil. The embryo is\r\nstraight.--~_Desmodium gyrans_ is well-known for its motile leaflets.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 513.--_Hedysarum coronarium._]\r\n\r\n=10.= DALBERGIEÆ. 25 genera; especially in Tropical America; the\r\nmajority are trees, a few shrubs or lianes; the leaves are simple\r\nor imparipinnate. The fruit is _indehiscent_ in all; in some it is\r\na winged, in others a wingless _nut_ (_Machærium_, _Dalbergia_,\r\n_Centrolobium_, etc.), in others, again, a drupe, _e.g._ in _Dipteryx_\r\n(Tonquin-bean) and _Andira_. In some genera the embryo is straight.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. Especially effected by Bees. The nectar is secreted\r\n   by a ring or disc-like portion round the base of the gynœceum or\r\n   the inner surface of the receptacle. The flower is constructed\r\n   with a peculiar mechanism to ensure cross-pollination by\r\n   insects. The pollen is shed just before the flower opens, and\r\n   is retained in a pouch formed by the keel. An insect visiting\r\n   the flower uses the wings and keel for a landing-stage, and\r\n   in attempting to reach the honey presses down the wings and\r\n   the keel which are locked together near the standard; the\r\n   stylar-brush by this means is forced through the apical opening\r\n   of the keel and a little pollen is thus swept out and deposited\r\n   upon the abdomen of the visiting insect as it presses against\r\n   the apex of the keel; the insect thus carries away pollen and\r\n   may effect cross-pollination. In the different flowers this\r\n   arrangement is modified in various ways to promote pollination.\r\n   5000 species (319 genera); especially in the Tropics, where\r\n   many are important forest trees.--The following plants are used\r\n   FOR FOOD: _Pisum sativum_ (W. Asia?) and _arvense_ (Italy);\r\n   _Phaseolus vulgaris_ (Kidney-bean, American; _Dolichos sinensis_\r\n   was known to the Greeks and Romans under the name “φασηλος,”\r\n   “phaseolus”), _P. compressus_ (French-bean), etc.; _Faba_\r\n   _vulgaris_ (Field-bean, Horse-bean; from the Old World);\r\n   _Ervum lens_ (Lentil, Eastern Mediterranean); in tropical\r\n   countries the oil-containing seeds of _Arachis hypogæa_.--The\r\n   following are FODDER plants: _Vicia sativa_, _Faba vulgaris_,\r\n   _Onobrychis sativa_ (Sainfoin), _Medicago sativa_ (Lucerne),\r\n   and _lupulina_ (Medick), species of _Trifolium_, _Hedysarum\r\n   coronarium_. OFFICINAL: “Liquorice root,” from _Glycyrrhiza\r\n   glabra_ (S. Europe); “Red Sandalwood,” from _Pterocarpus\r\n   santalinus_ (Tropical E. Asia); Gum Tragacanth, from\r\n   _Astragalus_-species (E. Mediterranean); Balsam of Peru, from\r\n   _Toluifera pereiræ_, and Balsam of Tolu, from _Toluifera\r\n   balsamum_. Calabar-beans, from _Physostigma venenosum_; Kino,\r\n   from _Pterocarpus marsupium_; the pith of _Andira araroba_ is\r\n   used under the name of “Chrysarobin.”--Of use TECHNICALLY:\r\n   _Genista tinctoria_ (yellow dye) and _Indigofera-species_\r\n   (Indigo), the bast of _Crotalaria juncea_ (Sunn Hemp); the\r\n   seeds of _Dipteryx_, which contain Coumarin, and are highly\r\n   scented, and Balsam of _Myroxylon_. POISONOUS: the seeds of\r\n   _Laburnum_ (_Cytisus laburnum_), various species of _Lathyrus_,\r\n   and _Abrus precatorius_; the latter contain two poisonous\r\n   proteids, paraglobulin and albumose, which resemble snake-poison\r\n   in their effects. The following are ORNAMENTAL plants:\r\n   _Phaseolus multiflorus_ (Scarlet runner, from America), _Robinia\r\n   pseudacacia_, _Amorpha_, _Colutea_, _Coronilla_, _Indigofera\r\n   dosua_, _Wistaria polystachya_, _Cytisus laburnum_ (Laburnum, S.\r\n   Europe, Orient.) and other species.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Mimosaceæ.= The flowers are most frequently hypogynous\r\nand _regular_, the æstivation of the corolla is _valvate_ and, in\r\nthe majority of instances, that of the calyx also. The flower is\r\n4-merous, less frequently 5- or 3-merous.--The flowers are generally\r\nsmall, but are always borne in compact, round _capitula_ or spikes\r\n(Fig. 514); they are hypogynous or perigynous. The calyx is generally\r\n_gamosepalous_ and the corolla _gamopetalous_, the latter being\r\nfrequently wanting. The stamens are equal or double the number of the\r\npetals (_Mimosa_, etc., in _M. pudica_, _e.g._ S4, P4, A4, G1) or\r\n(in _Acacia_, _Inga_, etc.) in a large, indefinite number, free or\r\nmonadelphous, often united to the corolla (Fig. 514 _b_). The colour of\r\nthe flower in most cases is due to the long and numerous stamens. The\r\n_fruit_ is various. The embryo is _straight_ as in the Cæsalpiniaceæ.\r\n_Entada_ and many species of _Mimosa_ have a flat, straight, or\r\nsomewhat sickle-like pod, which resembles the siliqua of the Cruciferæ\r\nin that the sutures (in this instance, however, dorsal and ventral\r\nsuture) persist as a frame, but the intermediate portion divides, as\r\nin the transversely divided siliqua, into as many nut-like portions as\r\nthere are seeds. Some species have a pod of enormous dimensions. The\r\nseeds of _Entada gigalobium_ are often carried from the West Indies to\r\nthe N. W. coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream.--The fruit of _Acacia_\r\nin some species is an ordinary pod, in others it is transversely\r\ndivided, or remains an undivided fruit, a nut.--This order includes\r\nboth trees and herbaceous plants, which are often thorny; the leaves\r\nare usually bipinnate (Fig. 514) and are sensitive, and also possess\r\nsleep-movements.--Many Australian Acacias have compound leaves only\r\nwhen young, but when old have _phyllodia_, _i.e._ leaf-like petioles\r\nwithout blades, placed vertically. A large number have thorny stipules,\r\nwhich in some (_Acacia sphærocephala_) attain an enormous size, and\r\nserve as a home for ants, which in return protect their host-plant\r\nagainst the attacks of other, leaf-cutting ants.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 514.--_Acacia farnesiana_: _a_\r\n  inflorescence; _b_ flower.]\r\n\r\nOther genera besides those mentioned are: _Adenanthera_, _Desmanthus_,\r\n_Parkia_, _Inga_ (with rather fleshy, indehiscent fruit), _Calliandra_,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n   1350 species (30 genera); none natives of Europe, their home\r\n   being the Tropics and sub-tropical regions, especially\r\n   Australia and Africa.--Fossils in Tertiary.--Gums are found in\r\n   many species of _Acacia_, especially the African (Gum arabic)\r\n   and Australian, of which some are _officinal_. The bark, and\r\n   also the fruits, contain a large amount of _tannic acid_ and\r\n   are used as astringents and in tanning (“Bablah” is the fruits\r\n   of several species of _Acacia_). Catechu is a valuable tanning\r\n   material extracted from the wood of _Acacia catechu_ (E. Ind).\r\n   The flowers of _Acacia farnesiana_ (Fig. 514) are used in\r\n   the manufacture of perfumes. With us they are cultivated as\r\n   ornamental plants, _e.g._ _A. lophantha_ and many others, in\r\n   conservatories.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 22. =Passiflorinæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers are most frequently regular, 5-merous in the three\r\nmost external whorls, eucyclic and perigynous or epigynous, less\r\nfrequently hypogynous. A characteristic feature is that the ovary is\r\n_tricarpellary_, _unilocular_, and with 3 _parietal_ placentæ which\r\nsometimes meet in the central line (_Cucurbitaceæ_). The styles are\r\ngenerally free and _bifid_. To all these characteristics, however,\r\nthere are exceptions. ~The Cucurbitaceæ are sometimes placed among the\r\nSympetalæ, close to the Campanulinæ, but they are not allied to the\r\nSympetalæ, from which they differ especially, for instance, in the\r\nstructure of the ovule. The position of the Begoniaceæ in this family\r\nis also open to doubt.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 515.--_Passiflora cœrulea_ (reduced).]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Passifloraceæ= (=Passion-flowers=). The majority are\r\nherbs which climb by means of tendrils (modified branches) and have\r\nscattered, stipulate leaves, often palminerved and lobed (Fig. 515).\r\nThe flowers, which are often large and beautiful, are regular, ☿, with\r\nS5, P5, A5, G3; the calyx and corolla are _perigynous_, and immediately\r\ninside the corolla is the “corona,” consisting of numerous, tapering,\r\nfilamentous bodies, or sometimes united in rings, most frequently\r\npetaloid and coloured; the stamens are raised on a long, round\r\ninternode above the _cup-like receptacle_; immediately above these is\r\nthe gynœceum with its 3 free styles and capitate stigmas; the ovary is\r\nunilocular with 3 parietal placentæ. Fruit most frequently a _berry_.\r\nThe seeds have an aril.\r\n\r\n   210 species; especially in Tropical America. Several\r\n   _Passiflora_-species are ornamental plants, and the fruits of\r\n   some species are edible.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Papayaceæ.= The best known representative is the Papaw\r\n(_Carica papaya_), a Tropical American tree whose stem is usually\r\nunbranched, and bears at its summit several large, palmilobed leaves\r\non long stalks. The stem and leaves have latex. The large, Melon-like\r\nberries are edible, and for this reason it is cultivated in the\r\nTropics. Flowers unisexual, with slightly different structure in\r\nthe ♂-and ♀-flowers, besides intermediate forms. The ♂-flower has a\r\ngamopetalous, the ♀-flower a polypetalous corolla.--The milky juice\r\ncontains a substance with similar action to pepsine. 10 stamens. 5\r\ncarpels.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Turneraceæ.= 85 species; especially in America.\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Samydaceæ.= 160 species; tropical.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Loasaceæ.= Herbaceous plants seldom shrubs, sometimes\r\nclimbing, and nearly always studded with _stiff hairs_, in some\r\ninstances stinging or hooked. The leaves are most frequently palmilobed\r\nand without stipules. The flowers are regular, ☿, polypetalous,\r\nentirely _epigynous_, with 4–5 sepals, petals and stamens, or more\r\nfrequently (by splitting) many stamens, those which are placed before\r\nthe sepals being generally barren and more or less petaloid; carpels\r\nmost frequently 3, united into an inferior, unilocular ovary with 3\r\nparietal placentæ, above which the receptacle is generally more or less\r\nprolonged. Fruit a capsule; in _Gronovia_ an ovary with 1 ovule and\r\nfruit a nut.\r\n\r\n   115 species; principally from S. Am. A number of annuals are\r\n   often grown in our gardens: _Bartonia aurea_ (California);\r\n   _Mentzelia_; _Cajophora_; _Gronovia_.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Datiscaceæ.= 4 species, especially in the Tropics.--_Datisca\r\ncannabina_ (Asia Minor) resembles the Hemp in external appearance. The\r\nflowers are diœcious, insignificant; ♂-flowers: a low, gamosepalous\r\ncalyx, no corolla, and an indefinite number of stamens; ♀-flowers;\r\n_epigynous_; ovary unilocular with free, mostly bifid, styles, and\r\ngenerally 3 parietal placentæ. In most cases the ovary is not entirely\r\nclosed at the top (as in _Reseda_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 516.--_Begonia rex_ (reduced).]\r\n\r\nOrder 7. =Begoniaceæ.= This order principally comprises herbs or\r\nunder-shrubs with succulent stems (having scattered vascular bundles\r\nin the pith); the leaves are arranged in two rows (a divergence of\r\n1/2) and _are asymmetrical_, as a rule more or less obliquely cordate,\r\nor ovate with cordate base (Fig. 516); large, caducous stipules are\r\npresent. Inflorescences dichasial, or unipared scorpioid cymes; the\r\nflowers are unisexual; the first ones (the oldest) are ♂-flowers, while\r\n♀-flowers are found especially on the younger axes. The ♂-flowers\r\nhave most frequently 2 + 2 coloured perianth-leaves, and many stamens\r\ncollected into a head in the centre of the flower; the ♀-flowers are\r\n_epigynous_ with 5 coloured perianth-leaves (placed spirally with a\r\ndivergence of 2/5) and a trilocular ovary, bearing 3 bifid styles and\r\n3 wings (the wings usually of unequal size); in the inner angle of\r\neach loculus there is one large projecting placenta, or two plate-like\r\nplacentæ (the bent back edges of the carpels) studded with ovules.\r\nFruit a capsule, with many extremely small seeds.--_Begonia._\r\n\r\n   420 species; almost all from the Tropics (Am., Asia).--Many\r\n   species, with varieties and hybrids, are ornamental plants in\r\n   houses and conservatories, chiefly on account of the form,\r\n   colour and markings of their leaves; but also for their very\r\n   beautiful flowers. They reproduce easily by adventitious buds\r\n   from leaves and portions of leaves placed on damp soil; some\r\n   have bulbils. Like the Oxalideæ they contain an acid sap.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 517.--_Ecballium agreste._ Diagram of a ♂-and\r\n  a ♀-flower.]\r\n\r\nOrder 8. =Cucurbitaceæ.= The flower is _epigynous_, and, as a rule,\r\nis also provided with a leaf-like, cup- or bell-shaped receptacle\r\nabove the ovary, to which the perianth and stamens are attached; the\r\nflowers are regular, _unisexual_, with rudiments of the other sex,\r\nand 5-merous: sepals 5, narrow and pointed, with the median sepal\r\nposterior (Fig. 517), petals 5, stamens 5, and carpels 3 (rarely 4–5);\r\nthe corolla is _gamopetalous_ in the majority, polypetalous in some;\r\ngenerally plicate-valvate in the bud. _The anthers in the ♂-flowers are\r\nextrorse, and monothecious, i.e. only one half of each of the anthers\r\nof the 5 stamens is developed_, the _pollen-sac_ having frequently a\r\npeculiar [tilde]-shaped curve (Fig. 518 _A_, _B_); the stamens are\r\n_either all united_ into a column (_e.g._ in _Cucurbita_), or they\r\nare _united in pairs_, so that only one remains free (Figs. 517 _A_;\r\n518 _A_); in the latter case there appears to be one small stamen\r\nwith a [tilde]-shaped, curved pollen-sac and two larger ones, each\r\nwith two curved pollen-sacs placed as in Fig. 517 _A_. The original\r\nform appears to be _Fevillea_ with free petals and 5 free stamens.\r\nSometimes the rudiment of a gynœceum is present. The carpels are united\r\ninto an _ovary_ with 3 (4–5) placentæ formed by their united edges.\r\nThese are thick, fleshy, and _bifid_, bearing a number of ovules on\r\neach side (Figs. 517 _B_; 518 _C_, _D_); in general the placentæ are\r\nso large that they not only meet in the centre, but also fill up the\r\novary as far as the wall of the pericarp. The whole interior of the\r\nfruit thus becomes a juicy mass in which three lines may be seen,\r\nmeeting in the centre (the boundaries of the individual placentæ),\r\nand near the circumference 6 groups of seeds (Fig. 518 _D_). When the\r\ncarpels are equal in number to the petals they alternate with them.\r\nThe _style_ is short and thick, and generally divided into 3 (4–5)\r\nbranches, with a horse-shoe shaped stigma on each branch (Fig. 518\r\n_C_). The _fruit_ is most frequently a many-seeded _berry_; in some it\r\nattains a considerable size and has a firm external layer (_Cucurbita_,\r\n_Lagenaria_, etc.). _The embryo is straight_, has _no endosperm_,\r\nbut contains a large quantity of _oil_. The exceptions to the above\r\ncharacters will be found under the genera.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 518.--_Citrullus colocynthis_: _A_ ♂-flower,\r\n  cut open and spread out; _B_ stamen; _C_ ♀-flower in long\r\n  section; _h_ receptacle; _ca_ calyx; _D_ transverse section of\r\n  ovary.]\r\n\r\nExclusively herbs, generally with stiff hairs and yellow flowers. Many\r\nspecies are annuals, others are perennial, having tuberous roots or\r\nhypocotyls. The leaves are scattered, long-stalked, in most cases more\r\nor less heart-shaped, palminerved, palmilobed, and exstipulate; in\r\ntheir axils are found both flowers (singly, or in an inflorescence)\r\nand a vegetative bud, and outside the axil, _on the anodic[37] side of\r\nthe leaf, a simple or branched tendril_, by which the plant _climbs_\r\n(exceptions: _e.g._ _Ecballium_).\r\n\r\n   The position of the flowers, branches and tendrils situated\r\n   in and near the leaf-axils is as follows. In the leaf-axils,\r\n   a flower is borne (as a branch of the first order), ♂ or ♀,\r\n   according to the conditions of the various genera. This branch\r\n   is not situated in the centre of the axil, but is removed\r\n   slightly towards the anodic side of the leaf. Of its two\r\n   bracteoles as a rule only the one lying on the anodic side is\r\n   developed, namely as a tendril, which is displaced to a position\r\n   outside the axil. The branch of the first order bears on its\r\n   catodic side an inflorescence (in the axil of the suppressed\r\n   bracteole), on the anodic side a vegetative bud which grows out\r\n   into a branch like the main axis. The subtending leaf of this\r\n   branch is thus the tendril; but when it has several arms the\r\n   condition is complicated by the appearance of an accessory bud\r\n   which unites with its subtending leaf, the tendril, its leaves\r\n   also becoming tendrils (situated on an undeveloped internode);\r\n   the many-branched tendril is thus a branch, and the tendril-arms\r\n   are its leaves, except the main arm which is its subtending\r\n   leaf. Other explanations of these difficult relations have\r\n   been given.--The _germination_ is somewhat peculiar, owing to\r\n   the fact that a heel-like prolongation is formed at the base\r\n   of the hypocotyl to assist in separating the two halves of the\r\n   testa from each other, and to facilitate the unfolding of the\r\n   cotyledons.\r\n\r\n_Cucurbita_ (Pumpkin, Marrow) has branched tendrils; the flowers are\r\nmonœcious, and are borne singly; the corolla is bell-shaped, and\r\ndivided almost as far as the middle. The stamens are all united into\r\na tube; the compressed seeds have a thick, blunt edge.--_Cucumis_ has\r\n(generally) unbranched tendrils; the ♀-flowers are borne singly, whilst\r\nthe ♂-flowers are borne in groups: the corolla is divided nearly as\r\nfar as the base, and the stamens are united 2-2-1. The connective is\r\nelongated above the anthers. The seeds have a sharp edge.--_Citrullus_\r\n(Fig. 518) has a corolla similar to _Cucumis_, but ☿-and ♂-flowers are\r\nborne singly; the stigma is only 3-lobed, the fruit most frequently\r\nspherical.--_Ecballium_ (Squirting Cucumber, only 1 species, E.\r\n_elaterium_) has no tendrils, and is therefore not a climber. The\r\noblong fruit is pendulous from the apex of its stalk, and when ripe is\r\ndistended with an acrid, watery fluid; on being touched the fruit is\r\ndetached, and the seeds, together with the watery fluid, are violently\r\nejected through the aperture formed at the base of the fruit. The\r\n♂-flowers are borne in racemes near the solitary ♀-flowers (Fig.\r\n517).--_Bryonia_ (White Bryony) has chiefly unbranched tendrils and\r\nsmall, greenish-yellow, usually diœcious flowers with rotate corolla,\r\nin many-flowered inflorescences; the small, spherical berry has no\r\nspecially firm outer layer, and generally only few seeds. The tap-root\r\nand a few of the other roots are tuberous. _B. alba_ (berry black;\r\nmonœcious) and _dioica_ (berry red; diœcious). ~Among other genera may\r\nbe mentioned: _Lagenaria_ (Gourd); the fruit has a woody external\r\nlayer which, after the removal of the pulpy integument, may be used\r\nas a gourd. _Luffa_ has a polypetalous corolla; the fruit is dry, and\r\nconsists internally of a network of vascular bundles; it opens by an\r\naperture at the summit. _Benincasa_; the fruit has a close, bluish\r\ncoating of wax. _Trichosanthes_ (Snake Cucumber) has a thin, round,\r\nlong and curved fruit. _Momordica_; the fleshy fruit opens and ejects\r\nthe seeds. _Cyclanthera_ takes its name from the staminal column which\r\nis found in the centre of the ♂-flower, bearing a bilocular, ring-like\r\nanther which opens by a horizontal cleft. The fruit is unilocular by\r\nsuppression, has 1 placenta, and when touched opens and ejects the\r\nseeds. _Sicyos_ and _Sechium_ have only unilocular ovaries with one\r\npendulous ovule. _Sechium_ has, moreover, 5 free stamens, of which only\r\none is halved, the other 4 having both halves of the anther. _Fevillea_\r\nand _Thladiantha_ also have 5 free stamens. _Dimorphochlamys_ has\r\ndimorphic flowers.~\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION is effected by insects, chiefly bees or wasps,\r\n   the nectar being secreted by the inner, yellow portion of the\r\n   receptacle; in the ♂-flower access is gained to the nectar\r\n   through the slits between the stamens, which arch over the\r\n   nectary.--85 genera; about 637 species; especially in the\r\n   Tropics. Only two are found in the whole of N. Europe, _Bryonia\r\n   alba_ and _dioica_; in S. Europe, _Ecballium_ also. Most of\r\n   the cultivated species have been obtained from Asia, such as\r\n   the Cucumber, Melon, Colocynth, several _Luffa_-species (the\r\n   “Gourds” mentioned in Scripture are _Cucumis chate_); from\r\n   Africa, the Water-melon, _Cucurbita maxima_, and others; from\r\n   S. Am., no doubt, the Pumpkin (_C. pepo_ and _melopepo_). USES.\r\n   Many species are used in medicine or for domestic purposes.\r\n   _Bitter_, _poisonous properties_ are found; the fruits of the\r\n   two _officinal_ ones are purgative: _Citrullus colocynthis_\r\n   (Mediterranean, E. India, Ceylon) and _Ecballium elaterium_,\r\n   as well as various tropical species, the roots of Bryonia,\r\n   etc.--The following are cultivated AS ARTICLES OF FOOD: Pumpkin\r\n   (_Cucurbita pepo_, etc.), Cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_), Melon\r\n   (_Cucumis melo_), the Water-melon (_Citrullus vulgaris_),\r\n   _Sechium edule_ (Chocho), certain species of _Luffa_ (the\r\n   young fruit). The Bottle Gourd is cultivated in tropical\r\n   countries for the sake of its hard pericarp, which is useful\r\n   for bowls, bottles, etc. The fruits of _Luffa_ have a number\r\n   of reticulately felted, tolerably firm vascular bundles, which\r\n   render them serviceable in various ways (as a kind of “sponge”).\r\n   The Cucurbits are of no use in the manufactures. Only a few are\r\n   cultivated as ornamental plants, chiefly as curiosities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 23. =Myrtifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe leaves are most frequently _opposite_, _simple_, _entire_ (rarely\r\ndentate), and _exstipulate_. The flowers are _regular_ and _epigynous_\r\n(perigynous in _Lythraceæ_ and a few others), ☿, polypetalous; the\r\nnumber of members in a whorl is generally 4 or 5 (S, P, A, or most\r\nfrequently A 2, G), but sometimes it becomes (_e.g._ Myrtles and\r\n_Lythraceæ_) very large in the andrœcium by splitting, and in the\r\ngynœceum also is often different. (When suppression takes place it is\r\nprincipally in the corolla and petal-stamens.) In nearly all instances\r\nthe calyx is _valvate_. Gyncœceum multicarpellary, multilocular,\r\nwith only one _style_ (except _Haloragidaceæ_). In the majority the\r\novules are situated on an axile placenta in the multilocular ovary.\r\n_Endosperm is wanting_ in the majority.--~Less important exceptions:\r\n_Rhizophoraceæ_ and _Gunnera_ have stipules. _Haloragidaceæ_ have\r\nseveral styles and endosperm. _Rhizophora_ also has endosperm.~\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Lythraceæ.= _Hermaphrodite_, _perigynous_ flowers which are\r\n_most frequently =6=-merous_, viz. S 6 (often with a _commissural_\r\n“_epicalyx_,” Fig. 519 _c_), one segment posterior, P 6, A 6 + 6 or\r\n6 + 0 and G =2–6=, forming a 2–6-locular ovary with many ovules in\r\nthe loculi, style single, and capitate stigma. The _gynœceum is free_\r\nat the base of the tubular, or bell-shaped, _thin_, strongly veined\r\nreceptacle, which bears the other leaf-whorls on its edge and inner\r\nside. Fruit a capsule. No endosperm.--To this order belong both herbs,\r\nshrubs and trees. The branches are frequently square, the leaves always\r\n_undivided_, _entire_, and without stipules, or with several very\r\nsmall stipules, and often opposite. The calyx is valvate. The flower\r\nis regular (except _Cuphea_) and frequently large and beautiful. The\r\nstamens are generally incurved in the bud, and the petals irregularly\r\nfolded.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 519.--_Lythrum salicaria._ _c_ the\r\n  “epicalyx.”]\r\n\r\n_Lythrum_ (Loose-strife). The flower is diplostemonous and 6-merous,\r\nwith a long, tubular receptacle with epicalyx-teeth (Fig. 519 _c_).\r\nThe 12 stamens are arranged in two tiers on the inner side of the\r\nreceptacle. The gynœceum is bicarpellary. ~The flowers are borne\r\nin small dichasia in the leaf-axils, and their number is increased\r\nby accessory inflorescences beneath the main inflorescence.--The\r\nnative species, _L. salicaria_, is trimorphic (long-styled, mid-and\r\nshort-styled forms, Fig. 520). Cross-pollination is chiefly\r\neffected by humble-bees and bees, which seek the nectar formed at\r\nthe bottom of the receptacle. Other species are only dimorphic,\r\nor even monomorphic.~--Closely allied are, _Nesæa_, _Diplusodon_,\r\n_Lagerstrœmia_, and _Cuphea_, whose flower resembles that of _Lythrum_,\r\nbut is zygomorphic. In _Cuphea_ the receptacle is oblique and at the\r\nback prolonged into a _spur_, in which the nectar, secreted by a\r\ngland situated behind the ovary, is collected; the calyx and corolla\r\ngradually become reduced in size toward the anterior side of the\r\nflower; the reverse, however, is the case with the 11 stamens (the\r\nposterior one is absent); the posterior loculus in the bilocular ovary\r\nis sometimes barren; the fruit, when ripe, dehisces along the posterior\r\nside, the ovary as well as the wall of the receptacle being ruptured\r\nby the placenta, which expands and projects freely. ~The flowers stand\r\nsingly in the centre of the stem, between the pairs of leaves. This\r\nmay be explained as follows: of the two foliage-leaves in each pair,\r\none supports a foliage-shoot, the other a flower; the foliage-shoot\r\nremains in the axil, but the flower is displaced through the length\r\nof an entire internode to the next pair of leaves, and then assumes\r\na position between these two leaves. All foliage-shoots stand in two\r\nrows, the flowers in two other rows.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 520.--_Lythrum salicaria._ One side of the\r\n  perianth is removed from all three flowers. _A_ is long-styled,\r\n  _B_ mid-styled, and _C_ short-styled. The direction of the arrows\r\n  and dotted lines indicates the best (legitimate) methods of\r\n  crossing.]\r\n\r\n   _Peplis_ (Water-purslane), a small, annual plant, with thin,\r\n   bell-shaped receptacle without projecting nerves. The small\r\n   flowers have no petal-stamens, and often also no corolla; fruit\r\n   indehiscent.--_Ammannia_ is closely allied to it.\r\n\r\n   365 species; 30 genera; mostly in the Tropics, and more\r\n   especially S. Am.--Some yield _dyes_, _e.g._ _Lawsonia inermis_\r\n   (cultivated in Africa and Asia) and _Lagerstrœmeria indica_;\r\n   some contain tannin; others are ornamental plants, especially in\r\n   gardens in warm countries.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Blattiaceæ.= 12 species. Tropical Asia and Africa.\r\n   Trees. Formerly included with _Punica_, but best placed as an\r\n   independent order.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Melastomaceæ.= A very natural and very large order\r\n   (150 genera; 2,500 species), its home being chiefly in tropical\r\n   S. America, especially the Brazils (termed by Schouw “The\r\n   kingdom of Palms and Melastomaceæ”). There are both herbaceous\r\n   and arborescent species, which are easily recognized by the\r\n   opposite or verticillate, simple leaves which have (with the\r\n   exception of a few heather-like species) 3–5–7–9 curved veins\r\n   proceeding from the base of the leaf, and connected very\r\n   regularly by closely parallel, transverse veins. The flower\r\n   is perigynous or epigynous; its type is that of the Onagraceæ\r\n   (4–5-merous; 1 whorl of sepals, petals and carpels, 2 of\r\n   stamens); the calyx is valvate, the corolla is twisted (to\r\n   the left) in æstivation; the stamens are very characteristic;\r\n   in the bud they are geniculate; the anther opens in the often\r\n   long, beak-like, prolonged point, with 1, less frequently with\r\n   2 pores, and has generally ear-like appendages at its base.\r\n   The fruit is a berry or capsule. These large and beautiful\r\n   flowering-plants play a very important part in South American\r\n   landscapes; otherwise they are of slight importance (a few are\r\n   cultivated in conservatories, _e.g._ _Centradenia_, _Medinilla_,\r\n   _Lasiandra_, _Tibouchina_, _Miconia_, etc.).\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Œnotheraceæ= (or =Onagraceæ=). The flowers are arranged in\r\nracemes or spikes, ☿, epigynous, regular, polypetalous, _=4=-merous in\r\nall 5 whorls_ (1 whorl of sepals, petals and carpels, 2 of stamens);\r\n2–3–5–6-merous flowers are less frequent; _the calyx is valvate_, the\r\n_corolla twisted_ in æstivation (the left edge being covered). Gynœceum\r\nsimple with multilocular ovary; the _style is undivided_, filiform,\r\nand bears a capitate or 4-partite stigma; endosperm wanting; embryo\r\nstraight.--The majority are herbs, especially water- and marsh-plants;\r\nseveral are shrubs. No essential oils. The leaves are alternate or\r\nopposite, always single, and without (or with very small) stipules.\r\n~The odourless flowers sometimes have a coloured calyx. In some\r\ninstances (_e.g._ _Œnothera_, _Fuchsia_) the receptacle is prolonged\r\nmore or less beyond the inferior ovary, and finally falls off. The\r\nstamens are obdiplostemonous (carpels epipetalous); the petal-stamens\r\nare sometimes suppressed. The anthers in some genera are divided into\r\nstoreys. The well-pronounced, triangular pollen-grains are connected\r\ntogether by viscous threads. Small stipules are sometimes found, _e.g._\r\n_Fuchsia_, _Lopezia_.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 521.--Flower of _Lopezia_.]\r\n\r\n=A.= =Fruit a capsule.= _Œnothera_ (Evening Primrose) is 4-merous,\r\nhas 8 stamens, a tubular receptacle, and an oblong capsule with\r\nloculicidal dehiscence leaving a centrally placed column, bearing\r\nthe seeds.--_Epilobium_ (Willow-herb) deviates from _Œnothera_\r\nespecially in the seeds being hairy (at the chalazal end of the\r\nseed).--_Chamænerium_ is a Willow-herb with zygomorphic flowers.--~The\r\nfollowing may be included here: _Clarkia_, _Eucharidium_ (an _Œnothera_\r\nwith 4 stamens and 3-lobed petals), _Godetia_ and _Boisduvalia_,\r\n_Jussiæa_ (dehiscence septicidal), _Isnardia_ (petal-stamens absent,\r\nsometimes the petals also).--_Lopezia_ has a peculiar, zygomorphic\r\nflower (Fig. 521); one of the four sepals is bent forwards and the\r\nother 3 backwards; the posterior petals are narrower than the 2\r\nanterior ones which are turned obliquely backwards and bent like\r\na knee, with a greenish nectary at the bend; 2 stamens, one only\r\nfertile (the posterior), while the anterior is barren, petaloid, and\r\nspoon-shaped; both are sensitive, which is essential for pollination.\r\nIn Fig. 521, _a_ represents an early stage, in which the stamen and\r\nstyle lie concealed in the staminode; _b_ is the ♂ stage, the stamen\r\nprojects from the centre of the flower; _c_, the ♀ stage, the style\r\noccupies the place of the stamen.~\r\n\r\n=B.= =Fruit a berry.= _Fuchsia_ generally has a coloured calyx and\r\ntubular receptacle; the corolla may be wanting.\r\n\r\n=C.= =Fruit a nut.= _Circæa_ (Enchanter’s Nightshade) has a 2-merous\r\nflower (S2, P2, A2 + 0 [petal-stamens are wanting], G2). The flowers\r\nare borne in racemes without bracts.--_Gaura._\r\n\r\n=D.= =Fruit a drupe.= _Trapa_ (Horn-nut); a peculiar aquatic plant;\r\nthe submerged stem has long internodes and lanceolate leaves, falling\r\noff at an early period, but at each node are found 4 long roots with\r\nthin, lateral roots (sometimes erroneously regarded as leaves) borne\r\npinnately; the stem reaching the surface of the water, bears a rosette\r\nof rhombic foliage-leaves, with large, inflated stalks containing air,\r\nand forming the floating apparatus of the plants. In the axils of the\r\nleaves (as in _Gunnera_) 8 small, stipular structures are present. The\r\nflowers are solitary in the axils of the foliage-leaves (S4, P4, A4 +\r\n0, G2), _semi_-epigynous. There is an 8-lobed, crenate disc on the free\r\nportion of the ovary; one ovule in each loculus. The fruit is a _drupe_\r\nwith 4 (or 2) prominent horns (the persistent sepals), which after the\r\npulp has decayed away bear a series of hooks turned downwards on each\r\nside, _i.e._ sclerenchymatous bundles which formerly lay concealed\r\nin the pulp of the sepals. ~The germination is peculiar: one of the\r\ncotyledons is large, and its thick extremity remains in the fruit,\r\nthe other however is small and is pushed out at the apex of the fruit\r\ntogether with the radicle and plumule; the development of the root soon\r\nceases, and the plumule usually grows into a stem entirely without\r\nbranches, similar to the one described above, only that 1–2 precisely\r\nsimilar shoots arise in the axil of each cotyledon, so that each embryo\r\nproduces 3–5 shoots.--_Trapa_, by its mode of life, its 1-seeded fruit,\r\netc., forms a transition to _Haloragidaceæ_.~\r\n\r\n   The large-flowered forms are adapted for insect-pollination and\r\n   are often protandrous, the small-flowered ones are homogamous\r\n   and may pollinate themselves. _Œnothera_ is adapted for\r\n   hawk-moths and bees.--330 species; especially in temperate\r\n   climates, chiefly in the Northern Hemisphere. _Epilobium_,\r\n   _Circæa_ are natives of this country; _Trapa_ is extinct in this\r\n   country, it has been found in a semi-fossilized condition near\r\n   Cromer and in bogs in Denmark, and existed in Sweden until a few\r\n   years ago; _Œnothera_ has been introduced from N. Am.--A number\r\n   of N. Am. species are grown as ornamental plants in our gardens.\r\n   The seeds of _Trapa natans_ are edible, and used as food in\r\n   China.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Haloragidaceæ.= This is a reduced form of the Œnotheraceæ,\r\nand principally differs from these in the presence of _endosperm_\r\nand _free styles_. _Only 1 ovule in each loculus._--84 species\r\ndistributed over the entire globe; the majority are aquatic\r\nplants. The most advanced type is _Myriophyllum_ (Water-Milfoil),\r\nwith a regular, epigynous flower (S4, P4, A4 + 4, G4), most\r\nfrequently _diclinous_ (monœcious); the fruit is a _2–4-partite\r\nschizocarp_. Aquatic plants, most frequently with pectinate, pinnate\r\nleaves.--_Haloragis._--~_Gunnera_ (a dozen species from the Southern\r\nHemisphere) forms the next step in the reduction. Large, scattered,\r\nrough-haired, and softly-spined leaves, with small flowers in crowded\r\ninflorescences. The flower, when most complete, has S2, P2, A2\r\n(petal-stamens) and G2, forming an inferior, unilocular ovary with\r\n1 ovule. It is remarkable for the great number of stipules placed\r\nin transverse rows in the leaf-axils, for the peculiar glandular\r\norgans, and for the colonies of _Nostoc_, which are found embedded in\r\nthe cortex as a kind of parasite.~--The simplest form is _Hippuris_\r\n(Mare’s-tail) with an extremely small, crenate or entire calyx, without\r\ncorolla, and with only one stamen and one carpel, forming an inferior,\r\nunilocular ovary with only one ovule. Fruit a drupe with thin pulp.\r\n~It is an aquatic plant with creeping, sympodial rhizome, and erect\r\nunbranched shoots, bearing numerous small, verticillate leaves. The\r\nsmall flowers are situated singly in the leaf-axils.~\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Rhizophoraceæ.= Tropical trees or shrubs (50 species,\r\n   the best known being _Rhizophora mangle_, Mangrove) which grow\r\n   gregariously, especially along the banks of rivers and by\r\n   sea-coasts, where the water is quiet and brackish, and where\r\n   they form the so-called Mangrove-swamps. Aerial roots are formed\r\n   on the stems and branches (Fig. 522 _A_). The seeds germinate\r\n   in the fruit, which by arrest contains only one seed (Fig. 522\r\n   _B_), before it is detached from the tree. The radicle projects\r\n   considerably from the seed, and hangs down freely in the air;\r\n   when the embryo is finally detached from the mother-plant,\r\n   the separation is effected by the hood-like cotyledon, which\r\n   entirely envelops the plumule, becoming detached from the rest\r\n   of the embryo, which falls down, while the hood-like cotyledon\r\n   remains enclosed in the fruit. The embryo, after it has fallen,\r\n   strikes root, and continues growing in the undisturbed mud\r\n   under the trees, or perhaps it may first be drifted about by\r\n   the water, being well adapted for this by its peculiar, tough\r\n   nature, and large, intercellular spaces.--It may also further\r\n   be remarked that the anther is divided into a number of small\r\n   loculi. The leaves are stipulate. The endosperm projects from\r\n   the micropyle, growing out from the base of the seed, and thus\r\n   serves as an organ of suction to convey nutriment to the embryo\r\n   from the mother-plant.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Combretaceæ.= Trees and shrubs, partly lianes.\r\n   An inferior, unilocular ovary with few pendulous ovules.\r\n   _Conocarpus_ and _Laguncularia_ form, in conjunction with\r\n   the species of Rhizophoraceæ, the tropical Mangrove-swamps.\r\n   _Terminalia._--280 species; Tropics.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:  FIG. 522.--_Rhizophora mangle_ with the germinating\r\n  fruit (much reduced).]\r\n\r\nOrder 8. =Myrtaceæ (Myrtles).= The plants belonging to this order are\r\nshrubs or trees, the majority being easily recognised by the vegetative\r\ncharacters. The leaves, for instance, are most frequently opposite,\r\nwithout stipules, undivided and entire, parchment-like or leathery,\r\nevergreen, _aromatic_, finely dotted by _pellucid glands containing\r\nessential oils_; the venation is penninerved with a nerve just inside\r\nand running parallel to the edge of the leaf. The flowers are regular,\r\nepigynous (Figs. 523, 524, 525) and ☿, most frequently =4-= or 5-merous\r\nin the calyx and corolla, with _many_ stamens (by splitting, so that\r\nthey are often in several distinct bundles) and an ovary with one\r\nstyle, formed of 2–5–many carpels; the receptacle is most frequently\r\nunited for its entire length with the ovary. The fruit varies, but is\r\n_most frequently a berry_. The embryo is thick, often curved, with\r\nunited cotyledons; no endosperm.\r\n\r\n=1.= MYRTEÆ, MYRTLE GROUP. Chiefly American, though some are found also\r\nin Africa and Asia. The fruit is a _berry_ with generally 2–5 loculi in\r\nthe ovary, and many ovules in each.--_Myrtus_; _Eugenia_ (the petals\r\nfall off together as a hood in the Clove, _E. caryophyllata_, Figs.\r\n523, 524); _Myrcia_; _Jambosa_; _Amomis_; _Psidium_, etc.\r\n\r\n=2.= PUNICEÆ, POMEGRANATE GROUP. Only 2 species (_Punica granatum_;\r\nfrom Persia, Afghanistan), differing in several respects from the\r\ntypical form of the Myrtaceæ. The leaves are generally _opposite_,\r\nwithout glands and marginal veins. The receptacle, calyx and corolla\r\nare red; the latter 5–8–(generally 6-) merous. Calyx valvate and\r\ncorolla folded as in Lythraceæ, stamens also and epicalyx as in this\r\norder. The most characteristic feature is the inferior, spherical\r\nberry, with dry pericarp, formed from two whorls of carpels in two\r\ntiers (Fig. 525); the interior whorl, which is also the lower, has\r\n3 carpels, and the placentæ are situated in the inner angles of the\r\n3 loculi; the external whorl is 5-merous, and the placentæ have\r\noriginally the same position in the inner angles of the loculi, but\r\ntheir position is changed to the outer side of the loculi owing to the\r\ngrowth of the wall of the ovary, which takes place early, causing the\r\ncarpels to become, as it were, turned inside out, so that the part\r\nwhich was turned downwards is turned upwards, and the part which was\r\nturned inwards becomes turned outwards (as in _Mesembrianthemum_). The\r\nedible part of the fruit is the _fleshy testa_, as in _Ribes_. The\r\ncotyledons are rolled together spirally.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 523, 524.--_Eugenia caryophyllata._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 523.--Flowers (nat. size).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 524.--A bud (“clove”), long. sec. (mag.).]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 525.--_Punica granatum._ Flower, long. sec.\r\n  (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n=3.= LECYTHIDEÆ. The majority are South American. The leaves are\r\nscattered, without pellucid glands, and frequently dentate. The flowers\r\nare zygomorphic. The woody fruits are either indehiscent, or open by\r\na lid. To this belong: _Bertholletia_ (_B. excelsa_), the seeds well\r\nknown as “Brazil-nuts,” _Lecythis_ (Sapucaia-nuts from _L. ollaria_),\r\n_Barringtonia_.\r\n\r\n=4.= LEPTOSPERMEÆ. Almost entirely from Australia and the East\r\nAsian and Pacific Islands. The fruit is a _capsule_. The leaves\r\nare scattered, and in some placed edgewise by the twisting of the\r\nleaf-stalks.--_Eucalyptus_, the Australian Gum-tree; the calyx falls\r\noff like a lid (Figs. 526, 527). Some of the species attain gigantic\r\nheights, _E. amygdalina_ 140–150 m. with a diameter of 8 m. The leaves\r\nin _E. globulus_ are opposite and dorsiventral on the young plant; on\r\nthe older scattered, placed edgewise by the twisting of the leaf-stalk,\r\nand isolateral; _Metrosideros_, _Calothamnus_ (stamens distinctly\r\npolyadelphous), _Melaleuca_, _Leptospermum_, _Callistemon_ (the flowers\r\nare borne in spikes whose axis continues to grow after flowering, thus\r\nseveral zones of fruits may be seen on the same branch).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 526, 527.--_Eucalyptus globulus._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 526.--Long. sect. of flower.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 527.--Flower opening.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=5.= CHAMÆLAUCIEÆ. Australian shrubs with heath-like appearance; they\r\ndiffer from the other Myrtaceæ in having a unilocular ovary with few,\r\nbasal ovules, and a 1-seeded _nut_. The sepals are often pappus-like,\r\nand divided into many bristles.--_Chamælaucium_, _Darwinia_, etc.\r\n\r\n   This large order (2,100 species) is confined almost entirely to\r\n   the Tropics, being found principally in America and Australia.\r\n   In Europe, only _Myrtus communis_.--Several are useful on\r\n   account of the large quantity of _volatile oils_ (contained\r\n   in internal glands): the flower-buds (“Cloves”) of _Eugenia\r\n   caryophyllata_ (the Moluccas, cultivated in the Tropics, Figs.\r\n   523, 524); the unripe, dry berries (“Pimento”) of _Myrtus\r\n   pimenta_ (_Pimenta officinalis_, W. Indies); Cajeput oil is\r\n   extracted from _Melaleuca minor_ and _leucadendron_ (East\r\n   Asian Islands). _Eucalyptus globulus_ (Australia) has of late\r\n   years become well known on account of its rapid growth, its\r\n   hard wood, and its antipyretic qualities; it is cultivated on\r\n   swampy soils, which it helps to drain.--OFFICINAL: “Cloves,”\r\n   and the cork of both stem and root of _Punica granatum_.\r\n   Several have EDIBLE FRUITS, such as _Psidium guyava_ (Guava,\r\n   var. _pomiferum_ and _pyriferum_, Am.), _Eugenia cauliflora_\r\n   and others, _E. jambosa_, _Punica granatum_ (the Pomegranate),\r\n   etc. EDIBLE SEEDS (with abundance of _fatty oil_): “Brazil\r\n   nuts” from _Bertholletia excelsa_ (Trop. S. Am.). “Bay-rum”\r\n   is extracted from the leaves and fruits of the Bayberry-tree\r\n   (_Pimenta acris_, W. Ind.); Guava-rum from the berries of\r\n   _Eugenia floribunda_. _Tannin_ is found in large quantities\r\n   _e.g._ in _Punica_. _Gum_ is formed by many Australian Eucalypti\r\n   (“Gum-trees”). ORNAMENTAL PLANTS cultivated in this country are:\r\n   _Myrtus communis_ (Mediterranean), several in conservatories,\r\n   especially the Australian Leptospermeæ, Eucalyptæ and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 24. =Umbellifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe flower is regular, ☿, and _completely epigynous_, 5- or 4-merous,\r\nwith =1= whorl of stamens and 5–2 carpels. _Sepals very small,\r\ntooth-like._ The _corolla is polypetalous, most frequently valvate in\r\næstivation_ (least pronounced in the Umbelliferous plants). Round the\r\nbase of the styles, which are generally free, there is an _epigynous_\r\n(undivided, or divided) _nectar-disc_ (“stylar-foot”: Figs. 528 _B_,\r\n_C_, _D_; 539); the number of loculi in the ovary equals that of the\r\ncarpels; _only =1= pendulous (anatropous) ovule_ (Fig. 528 _C_) _in\r\neach loculus_. Endosperm copious (Fig. 528 _D_). To this must be added\r\nthat the inflorescence in the majority of cases is an _umbel_ or a\r\ncapitulum, especially in the _Umbelliferæ_ and _Araliaceæ_. Stipules\r\nare absent, but most frequently the base of the petiole forms a large\r\nsheath.\r\n\r\n   The Umbellifloræ are on one side so closely allied to the\r\n   Frangulinæ, especially Rhamnaceæ, that they may perhaps be\r\n   regarded as the epigynous continuation of this family. On\r\n   the other hand, the similarities to the Rubiales, especially\r\n   those between Cornaceæ and Sambuceæ, are so great that there\r\n   is scarcely any character to distinguish them except the\r\n   polypetalous corolla of the former and the gamopetalous corolla\r\n   of the latter. Whether this is more than a merely analogous\r\n   resemblance, and if not, whether the Cornaceæ at least should\r\n   not be included in the Rubiales, must be left in abeyance.--The\r\n   sepals are very small, as is generally the case in epigynous\r\n   flowers.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Cornaceæ.= The majority of the species are shrubs with solid\r\ninternodes, _opposite_ (rarely scattered) leaves, which are _simple_,\r\n_entire_ (rarely incised), penninerved, _without_ stipules or large\r\nsheaths; flowers _=4=-merous_ (most frequently S4, P4, A4, G2), borne\r\nin dichasia which are either collected into corymbs (_e.g._ _Cornus\r\nsanguinea_), or in closely crowded umbels or capitula (_Cornus mas_,\r\n_C. suecica_), in which latter case there is often a _large_, leafy, or\r\ncoloured, most frequently 4-leaved _involucre_ round the base of the\r\ninflorescence; the _style is undivided_, with lobed stigma; the raphe\r\nof the ovule is turned _outwards_. The fruit is a _berry_ or a _drupe_,\r\nwith a 1–4-locular stone or 2 free stones.\r\n\r\n_Cornus_ (Dogwood, Cornel) has S4, P4, A4, G2. Leaves opposite.\r\n\r\n_Drupe_ with a bilocular, 2-seeded stone.--_Aucuba_, diœcious;\r\nunilocular ovary; 1 ovule; 1-seeded berry.--_Garrya._--_Helwingia._\r\n\r\n   80 species; N. Temp. The fruits of _Cornus mas_ are edible;\r\n   the wood is very hard; gum is found in some. Several species\r\n   of _Cornus_ and _Aucuba japonica_ (Japan) are cultivated as\r\n   ornamental shrubs.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Araliaceæ (Ivies).= Principally _trees_ or _shrubs_ with\r\n_solid stems_. The leaves are _scattered_, simple or compound, with\r\na sheath more or less developed. The flowers are most frequently\r\nsituated in umbels or capitula which are either borne singly or in\r\nracemes, or in paniculate inflorescences. The small, most frequently\r\nyellowish-green flowers are =5=-_merous_, in the calyx, corolla, and\r\nandrœcium; the gynœceum may be 5-merous or may have some other number\r\n(=2=-∞). The styles are most frequently several, free; the _raphe_\r\nof the ovules is turned _inwards_ as in the Umbelliferous plants.\r\nThe fruit is a _drupe_ or _berry_.--~Stellate hairs often occur. The\r\npetals generally have a broad base, and a thick apex which is slightly\r\nincurved, and a distinctly valvate æstivation.~\r\n\r\n_Hedera helix_ (Ivy) climbs by adventitious roots. The leaves are\r\npalminerved and lobed on the sterile branches, but often ovate and not\r\nlobed on the flowering branches. ~The flowers are yellowish-green and\r\nopen in the autumn; they are slightly protandrous, and are visited by\r\nflies and wasps. Berries black. Endosperm ruminate.--_Panax._ _Aralia_\r\n(with _Dimorphanthus_).~\r\n\r\n   375 species, 51 genera; especially in the Tropics (E.\r\n   Asia).--The Ivy, several species of _Aralia_, _e.g._ _A.\r\n   japonica_ (_Fatsia_), _Gastonia palmata_, are cultivated as\r\n   ornamental plants. Paper is manufactured from the pith of\r\n   _Aralia papyrifera_ (China).\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Umbelliferæ.= _The stem is herbaceous_ with _hollow\r\ninternodes_; the leaves are _scattered_, and have a broad, amplexicaul\r\nbase, a _large, most frequently inflated sheath_, and generally a\r\npinnate (often very much dissected) blade. ~Entire leaves are found in\r\n_Hydrocotyle vulgaris_; _Bupleurum_.~\r\n\r\nThe flowers are ☿, regular, small, but collected in _compound umbels_,\r\nthat is, in “simple umbels,” which again are borne in umbels (for\r\nexceptions see _Hydrocotyleæ_); the external flowers in the simple\r\numbel have often subtending bracts, which surround the base as an\r\n_involucre_, and may be termed the _small involucre_; the internal ones\r\nhave no bracts; when involucral leaves are present at the base of the\r\ncompound umbel, they may be termed the _large involucre_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 528.--_Daucus carota_ with flower and fruit.]\r\n\r\nThe _flower_ has =5= sepals (the median, as usual, posterior), =5=\r\npetals, =5= stamens and =2= carpels (in the median line) (Fig. 528).\r\nThe calyx is often scarcely indicated. The petals have a short claw\r\nare most frequently obcordate, or have an incurved apex (Fig. 528 _B_,\r\n_C_), being incurved in the bud; they are white, rarely yellow (Fennel\r\nand Parsnips), blue or red. The flowers are sometimes zygomorphic,\r\nespecially those on the circumference of the umbel, and in that case\r\nit is the petal which is directed outside (anterior) which is the\r\nlargest, and the two posterior are the smallest (_e.g. Heracleum_).\r\nThe stamens are _incurved_ in the bud. The 2 _free styles_ unite at\r\nthe base into the “stylar-foot” (_stylopod_), a swollen nectary (Fig.\r\n528 _B_, _C_); the ovary is bilocular, the raphe of the ovules being\r\ndirected inwards. _The fruit is a schizocarp_, _dividing into two\r\nmericarps_; the plane in which these separate coincides with that of\r\nthe union of the carpels, and the two _nut-like mericarps_ are in\r\nmost genera kept together for awhile at the top of a thin, bifid, or\r\nundivided stalk (_carpophore_) which is in direct continuation with\r\nthe flower-stalk (Fig. 537). Each mericarp has most frequently 5 more\r\nor less strongly projecting ridges, the _primary ridges_ (Figs. 530,\r\n532, 534, 535, etc.), of which 3 lie on the back of the mericarp, the\r\n_dorsal ridges_, and 2 on its edge near the plane of division, the\r\n_marginal ridges_; five of these (10 ridges in all in the entire fruit)\r\nare placed opposite the calyx-teeth and the others between them. In\r\nsome genera there are in addition 4 _secondary ridges_ to each mericarp\r\nbetween the primary ones (Fig. 528 _E_: the secondary ridges bear the\r\nlong bristles). Inside these secondary ridges, or inside the grooves\r\nbetween the primary ridges, when the secondary ridges are absent, _oil\r\nducts_ (vittæ, schizogenous ducts) are found in the pericarp, most\r\nfrequently one in each groove; two are also often found on the ventral\r\nside of each mericarp (Figs. 528 _E_, 530 _ol_, etc.). The seed is\r\nmost frequently united with the pericarp. The _embryo_ is _small_ and\r\nlies high up in the large, most frequently horny endosperm (Fig. 528\r\n_D_).--The endosperm _does not contain starch, but oil_, and presents\r\nthree different forms, of important systematic value: (=a=) those which\r\nare quite flat on the ventral side (_i.e._ the side turned towards the\r\nplane of splitting) (Figs. 528 _E_, 530, 531, 534, etc.): the majority\r\nof the genera, ORTHOSPERMEÆ (_e.g._ _Carum_, _Pastinaca_); (=b=)\r\nthose in which the endosperm on the ventral side is provided with a\r\nlongitudinal groove, often deep: CAMPYLOSPERMEÆ (_e.g._ _Anthriscus_);\r\nthe transverse section is nearly a crescent (Fig. 532); (=c=) those\r\nin which the endosperm is concave on the ventral side (hollow in\r\nboth longitudinal and transverse sections): CŒLOSPERMEÆ (_e.g._\r\n_Coriandrum_) (Fig. 538).\r\n\r\n   The genera are distinguished first of all by the endosperm and\r\n   forms of fruit, the ridges and oil-ducts; then by the form of\r\n   the umbel, the calyx and corolla, by the absence or presence of\r\n   an involucre, etc.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 529.--_Hydrocotyle vulgaris._ Transverse\r\n  section of fruit.]\r\n\r\n1. HYDROCOTYLEÆ, PENNY-WORT GROUP. _Capitula_ or _simple umbels_\r\n(all the other groups have compound umbels). No oil-ducts.\r\nOrthospermous.--_Hydrocotyle_ (Penny-wort). The fruit is _considerably\r\ncompressed_ laterally (Fig. 529). The calyx-teeth are small. The leaves\r\nare peltate.--_Didiscus._--_Sanicula_ (Sannicle). The umbels are small,\r\ncapitate, generally collected in a raceme; calyx-teeth distinct. ♂-and\r\n♀-flowers in the same umbel. The fruits are round, studded with hooked\r\nbristles. No carpophore.--_Astrantia_ has an umbel surrounded by a\r\nlarge, often coloured involucre, with this exception it is the same\r\nas the preceding, but the fruit is slightly compressed, with 5 equal\r\nridges. _Hacquetia_ (_Dondia_).--_Eryngium_ (Sea Holly): leaves often\r\nthorny. The flowers _are all sessile_, the inflorescence is thus a\r\ncapitulum; each flower is often subtended by a bract, which is thorny\r\nlike the involucre, resembling the burrs of the Teasel. The sepals are\r\nlarge.--~_Lagœcia_: one of the loculi of the ovary is suppressed.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 530.--Fruit of _Carum petroselinum_: _fr_\r\n  endosperm; _ol_ oil-ducts.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 531.--_Pimpinella._ Transverse section of\r\n  fruit.]\r\n\r\n=2.= AMMIEÆ, CARAWAY GROUP (Figs. 530–532). The fruit has only the 10\r\nprimary ridges; it is usually short, almost spherical or broadly ovate\r\nand distinctly _compressed_ laterally. Oil-canals are most frequently\r\npresent. Orthospermous (except _Conium_).--_Cicuta_ (Cow-bane).\r\nPointed calyx-teeth. Glabrous herbs with pinnate or bipinnate leaves.\r\n~_C. virosa_ has a thick, vertical rhizome, divided by transverse\r\nsepta into many compartments; the leaflets are narrow, lanceolate,\r\nand dentate; the large involucre is wanting.~--_Apium_ (Celery). No\r\ncalyx-teeth. _A. graveolens_, a maritime plant, has neither large nor\r\nsmall involucre; the umbels are short-stalked or sessile.--_Carum_\r\n(Caraway). Calyx-teeth small; the large involucre is wanting or is only\r\nfew-leaved. _C. carvi_ (Caraway). _C. petroselinum_, (Parsley) (Fig.\r\n530). _Falcaria_; _Ammi_; _Helosciadium_; _Bupleurum_ (Hare’s-ear) with\r\nsimple leaves and yellow corolla; _Pimpinella_ (Fig. 531); _Sium_;\r\n_Ægopodium_ (_A. podagraria_, Gout-weed) has bi- or tri-ternate leaves,\r\nwith ovate, dentate leaflets; the large involucre is wanting.--_Conium_\r\nis campylospermous (Fig. 532); the short, broadly ovate fruit has\r\ndistinctly projecting, often wavy crenulate ridges. _C. maculatum_\r\n(Hemlock) has a round, smooth stem with purplish spots.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 532.--_Conium maculatum._ Fruit entire and\r\n  in transverse section.]\r\n\r\n=3.= SCANDICEÆ. This group has a distinctly oblong or linear fruit\r\nwhich is _slightly compressed laterally_, and generally prolonged\r\nupwards into a “beak”; wings absent. _Campylospermous._ Otherwise\r\nas in the Ammieæ.--_Anthriscus_ (Beaked Parsley) has a lanceolate\r\nfruit, round on the dorsal side, without ridges, but with a ten-ridged\r\nbeak.--_Scandix_ (Shepherd’s-needle).--_Chærophyllum_ (Chervil): fruit\r\nlanceolate or linear with low, blunt ridges; beak absent or very short.\r\n_C. temulum_ has a red-spotted, hairy stem.--_Myrrhis_ (Cicely) has a\r\nshort beak and sharp, almost winged ridges. _M. odorata_ (Sweet Cicely)\r\nhas very long fruits.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 533.--_Œnanthe phellandrium._ Fruit entire\r\n  and in transverse section. _emb_ The embryo; _ol_ the oil-ducts;\r\n  _fr_ endosperm.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 534.--_Fœniculum vulgare._ Fruit in\r\n  transverse section.]\r\n\r\n=4.= SESELINEÆ, FENNEL GROUP (Figs. 533, 534). The fruit is slightly\r\nelliptical or oblong, in transverse section circular or nearly so,\r\nwithout grooves in the dividing plane; only primary ridges are\r\npresent. Orthospermous.--_Fœniculum_ (Fennel) has yellow petals; both\r\ninvolucres are wanting; the fruit is oblong. The ridges are thick, all\r\nequally developed, or the lateral ridges are slightly larger (Fig.\r\n534).--_Æthusa_ (_A. cynapium_, Fool’s Parsley); the large involucre\r\nis wanting or is reduced to one leaf, the small involucre is composed\r\nof three linear leaves which hang downwards on the outer side of the\r\numbels. The fruit is spherical-ovate, with thick, sharp, keeled ridges,\r\nthe lateral ones of which are the broadest.--_Œnanthe_ (Dropwort); the\r\nfruit (Fig. 533) has usually an ovate, lanceolate form, with distinct,\r\npointed sepals and long, erect styles; the ridges are very blunt, the\r\nmarginal ones a trifle broader than the others.--_Seseli_, _Libanotis_,\r\n_Cnidium_, _Silex_, _Silaus_, _Meum_, etc.\r\n\r\n=5.= PEUCEDANEÆ, PARSNIP GROUP (Figs. 535–537). The fruit is most\r\nfrequently very strongly _compressed_ dorsally, with broad, mostly\r\n_winged_, lateral ridges. Only primary ridges. The dorsal ridges may\r\nproject considerably, but are not winged. Orthospermous.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 535.--_Archangelica officinalis._\r\n\r\n  Transverse section of fruit.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 536.--_Scorodosma fœtidum._\r\n\r\n  Transverse section of fruit.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 537.--_Heracleum sphondylium._ Fruit.]\r\n\r\n=a.= The winged lateral ridges stand _out from each other_, so that the\r\nfruit appears to be 4-winged (Fig. 535).--_Angelica_; _Archangelica_\r\n(Fig. 535); _Levisticum_ (Lovage).\r\n\r\n=b.= The winged lateral ridges lie _close together_, and form one\r\nwing on each side of the fruit (Fig. 536).--_Pastinaca_ (Parsnip).\r\nCorolla yellow. The dorsal ridges are very weak; the oil-ducts do not\r\nreach quite as far as the base of the fruit. Both large and small\r\ninvolucres are wanting; leaflets ovate. _Anethum_ (Dill) is a Parsnip\r\nwith more distinct dorsal ridges and filamentous leaflets. _Peucedanum_\r\n(Hog’s-fennel); _Ferula_ (with _Scorodosma_, Fig. 536, and _Narthex_);\r\n_Dorema_.--_Heracleum_ (Cow-parsnip); the flowers in the margin of the\r\numbels are often very large, zygomorphic, and project like rays, _e.g._\r\nin _H. sibiricum_. The fruit is very flat, with very small dorsal\r\nridges; the oil-ducts are more or less club-like and _do not reach as\r\nfar as_ the base of the fruit (Fig. 537). _Imperatoria_; _Tordylium_.\r\n\r\n=6.= DAUCEÆ, CARROT GROUP (Fig. 528). The fruit has 18 ridges, _i.e._\r\neach fruitlet has 5 primary and 4 secondary ridges, the latter being\r\noften more prominent and projecting further than the primary ones. The\r\noil-ducts are situated under the secondary ridges (Fig. 528).\r\n\r\n=a.= ORTHOSPERMOUS: _Daucus_ (Carrot). The secondary ridges project\r\nmuch further than the primary, and bear on their crests a series of\r\nhooked spines (Fig. 528 _D_, _E_); these are much longer than the\r\nsmall bristles on the primary ridges. ~The involucral leaves of _D.\r\ncarota_ (Carrot) are numerous and deeply pinnate; the inflorescence\r\ncontracts during the ripening of the fruit, and since the external\r\numbels have longer stalks than the central ones, they arch over them,\r\nand the inflorescence becomes hollow. For the terminal flower, see\r\nbelow.~--_Cuminum_; _Laserpitium_; _Melanoselinum_.\r\n\r\n=b.= CAMPYLOSPERMOUS: _Torilis_ (Hedge Parsley). The primary ridges\r\nare covered with bristles; the secondary ridges are not. very distinct\r\non account of the spines, which entirely fill up the grooves.\r\n_Caucalis_ (Bur Parsley).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 538.--_Coriandrum sativum_: _b_ secondary\r\n  ridges; _d_ primary ridges; _f_ endosperm; _l_ embryo.]\r\n\r\n=c.= CŒLOSPERMOUS: _Coriandrum_ (Coriander) has a smooth, spherical\r\nfruit (Fig. 538) with a distinct, 5-dentate calyx, the two anterior\r\n(_i.e._ turned outward) teeth being generally longer than the others;\r\nthe two fruitlets scarcely separate from each other naturally; all the\r\nridges project only very slightly, the curved primary ones least, the\r\nsecondary ridges most.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. The flowers are adapted for insect-pollination;\r\n   they secrete nectar at the base of the styles; individually\r\n   they are rather small and insignificant, but yet are rendered\r\n   conspicuous by being always crowded in many-flowered\r\n   inflorescences. _Protandry_ is common, sometimes to such\r\n   an extent that the stamens have already fallen off before\r\n   the styles begin to develop (Fig 539, 2). Insect visits are\r\n   more frequent and numerous as the inflorescences are more\r\n   conspicuous. The flowers as a rule are ☿, but ♂-flowers are\r\n   often found interspersed among the others (Fig. 539), and the\r\n   number of these becomes greater on the umbels developed at the\r\n   latest period. A terminal flower, which differs from the others\r\n   in form, and in _Daucus carota_ often in colour also (purple),\r\n   is sometimes found in the umbel. The nectar lies so exposed and\r\n   flat that the flowers are principally visited by insects with\r\n   short probosces, especially Diptera; bees are less frequent\r\n   visitors, and butterflies rare.--1400 species (175 genera);\r\n   especially from temperate climates in Europe, Asia, N. Am. About\r\n   68 species in this country.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 539.--_Anthriscus silvester_: 1 ♂-flower; 2\r\n  ☿-flower.]\r\n\r\n   USES. A few are cultivated as ornamental plants. They are,\r\n   however, useful in medicine,[38] and for culinary purposes\r\n   on account of the _essential oils_ and _gum-resins_ which\r\n   in many are formed in root, stem, and fruit. The FRUITS of\r\n   the following are used: _Carum carvi_ [+] (Caraway), _Carum\r\n   petroselinum_ (Parsley; also the leaves and root; its home\r\n   is the Eastern Mediterranean); _Fœniculum capillaceum_ [+]\r\n   (Fennel; S. Europe); _Pimpinella anisum_ [+] (Anise; E.\r\n   Mediterranean); _Coriandrum sativum_ [+] (Coriander; S. Eur.);\r\n   _Œnanthe phellandrium_ (Water Dropwort); _Cuminum cyminum_\r\n   (Point Caraway; Africa; cultivated in S. Europe); _Anethum\r\n   graveolens_ (Dill). The LEAVES of the following are used as\r\n   pot-herbs: _Anthriscus cerefolium_ (Chervil); _Myrrhis odorata_\r\n   (Sweet Cicely; Orient.); _Conium maculatum_ [+] (the green\r\n   portions; Hemlock). Besides Parsley, the ROOTS of the following\r\n   are used: Carrot, Parsnip, _Sium sisarum_ (Sugar-root; E. Asia);\r\n   _Chærophyllum bulbosum_ (Chervil-root); _Levisticum officinale_\r\n   (foliage-shoots; S. Europe); _Imperatoria ostruthium_;\r\n   _Apium graveolens_ (Celery, the root in conjunction with the\r\n   internodes); _Pimpinella saxifraga_ and _magna_ (Pimpinell);\r\n   _Archangelica_ (Angelica, the root of _A. norvegica_ was\r\n   formerly an article of food in Norway). _Poisonous alkaloids_\r\n   are found in a few, such as Fool’s Parsley (_Æthusa cynapium_),\r\n   Hemlock (_Conium maculatum_), Cow-bane (_Cicuta virosa_)\r\n   and species of _Œnanthe_.--_Gum-resin_ is extracted from\r\n   various species: “Galbanum” from _Ferula galbaniflua_ [+] and\r\n   _rubricalis_ [+] (Persia); Asafœtida from _Ferula scorodosma_\r\n   [+] and _F. narthex_ [+]; Ammoniac-gum from _Dorema ammoniacum_\r\n   [+], all from Central and S. W. Asia. “_Silphium_” was an\r\n   Umbelliferous plant which grew in ancient times in Cyrene, and\r\n   from which the Romans extracted a valued condiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Family 25. =Hysterophyta.=\r\n\r\nThis family (with the exception of Aristolochiaceæ) includes only\r\nparasitic plants. Partly on this ground, and partly because they\r\nall have _epigynous_ flowers, they are considered to belong to the\r\nyoungest type (which is expressed in the name ὕστερος, the one that\r\ncomes after). It is not certain to which of the preceding families they\r\nare most nearly allied. ~Again, it is a matter of doubt whether the\r\nAristolochiaceæ are related to the others; they are by Engler united\r\nwith Rafflesiaceæ into one family, _Aristolochiales_.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 540.--Flower of _Aristolochia clematitis_\r\n  (long. sect.). _A_ Before pollination, and _B_ after: _n_ stigma;\r\n  _a_ anthers; _t_ an insect; _kf_ ovary.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. _Aristolochiaceæ._ The majority are perennial herbs or\r\ntwining shrubs, whose stalked, simple, and generally more or less\r\ncordate or reniform leaves are borne in 2 rows and are exstipulate.\r\nThe flowers are _hermaphrodite_, _epigynous_, regular or zygomorphic;\r\nperianth-leaves united, _simple_ but most frequently _petaloid_ and\r\n3-merous; 6 or 12 (in _Thottea_ as many as 36) stamens with _extrorse_\r\nanthers. The ovary is more or less completely 4–6-locular with ovules\r\nattached in the inner angles of the loculi (Fig. 540 _kf_). The style\r\nis short, and has a large, radiating stigma (Fig. 540 _n_). Fruit a\r\ncapsule. Seeds rich in endosperm.\r\n\r\n_Asarum europæum._ Each shoot has 2 reniform foliage-leaves, between\r\nwhich the terminal flower is borne (the rhizome becomes a sympodium\r\nby development of the bud in the axil of the upper foliage-leaf).\r\nThe flower is _regular_ and has a bell-shaped perianth with 3 outer\r\nvalvate, and 3 inner small segments (which may be wanting). =12= (2\r\n× 6) free, extrorse stamens, 6 carpels.--_Aristolochia clematitis_\r\n(Birth-wort) has an erect, unbranched stem, bearing many flowers in the\r\nleaf-axils, in a zig-zag row (accessory buds in a unipared scorpioid\r\ncyme). The flowers are zygomorphic (Fig. 540), formed by 3 alternating,\r\n6-merous whorls. The perianth has a lower, much-distended part (_k_),\r\nsucceeded by a narrow, bent tube (_r_), which passes over into an\r\noblique, almost tongue-like projection (6 vascular bundles indicate\r\nthat the number 6 is prevalent here, as in _Asarum_); =6= stamens (Fig.\r\n540 _a_), with the dorsal portion turned upwards, are united with the\r\nshort style to form a _stylar column_; they are placed quite beneath\r\nthe 6 commissural stigmatic rays, which arch over them as short, thick\r\nlobes. ~Protogynous; POLLINATION is effected in _Arist. clematitis_\r\nby small flies; these enter the erect unfertilised flower through\r\nthe tube (Fig. 540 _A_, _l_) without being prevented by the stiff,\r\ndownwardly-turned hairs which line the tube and prevent their escape;\r\nthey find the stigma (_n_) fully developed, and may pollinate it with\r\nthe pollen they have brought with them. The stigmas then straighten\r\nand wither (_B_, _n_), the anthers open, and the flies may again be\r\ncovered with pollen; but the hairs which blocked up the tube do not\r\nwither until the anthers have shed their pollen, and only then allow\r\nthe imprisoned flies to escape and effect cross-pollination. Prior to\r\npollination, the flowers stand erect, but after this has taken place\r\nthey become pendulous, and the perianth soon withers.--_A. sipho_\r\n(Pipe-flower), another species, is a climber, and often grown in\r\ngardens; it has only one row of accessory buds in the leaf-axils.--200\r\nspecies; chiefly in S. Am. OFFICINAL: the rhizome of _Aristolochia\r\nserpentaria_ (N. Am.).~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 541.--A fruit of _Myzodendron brachystachyum_\r\n  (slightly mag.) germinating on a branch.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Santalaceæ.= Parasites containing chlorophyll, which, by\r\nthe help of peculiar organs of suction (haustoria) on their roots,\r\nlive principally on the roots of other plants. Some are herbs,\r\nothers under-shrubs. The regular, most frequently ☿-flowers have\r\na simple perianth, which is gamophyllous, 3- or 5 partite with the\r\nsegments valvate in the bud, and a corresponding number of stamens\r\nopposite the perianth-leaves. In the inferior ovary there is a\r\n_free, centrally placed_, often long and curved _placenta_ with\r\nthree ovules (one opposite each carpel); these are naked, or in any\r\ncase have an extremely insignificant integument. Fruit a nut or\r\ndrupe. Seed without testa. Endosperm fleshy. 225 species; chiefly\r\nin the Tropics.--_Thesium_, a native, is a herb with scattered,\r\nlinear leaves and small 5-merous flowers (P5, A5, G3) in erect\r\nracemes; the subtending bracts are displaced on the flower-stalks.\r\nFruit a nut.--_Osyris_ (diœcious shrub; 3-merous flowers) is\r\nanother European genus.--_Santalum album_, which grows in E. Ind.,\r\nyields the valuable, scented Sandalwood, the oil of which is used\r\nmedicinally.--_Quinchamalium._\r\n\r\n   _Myzodendron_ is a reduced form of the Santalaceæ; the ♂-flowers\r\n   are without perianth; the perianth of the ♀-flower is 3-merous.\r\n   About 7 species; S. Am.; parasitic on a Beech (_Nothofagus_).\r\n   The fruit has 3 feathery brushes, alternating with the lobes\r\n   of the stigma, which serve as flying organs and to attach the\r\n   fruits to a branch (Fig. 541), the brushes twining round as\r\n   soon as they come in contact with it. There is only 1 seed in\r\n   the fruit, which germinates by a long, negatively heliotropic\r\n   hypocotyl, and is attached by a radicle modified into an\r\n   haustorium.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Loranthaceæ= (=Mistletoes=). Plants containing chlorophyll\r\nwhich are parasites on trees, and most frequently have opposite,\r\nsimple, entire leaves and regular, epigynous, often unisexual, 2- or\r\n3-merous flowers, with single or double perianth. Stamens equal in\r\nnumber and opposite to the perianth-leaves, free, or in varying degrees\r\nunited to one another. The inferior ovary is constructed as in the\r\nSantalaceæ, the ovules being situated on a low, free, centrally-placed\r\nplacenta, but the placenta and ovules unite with the wall of the ovary\r\ninto _one connected, parenchymatous mass_, in which _the embryo-sacs\r\nare imbedded_. Only 1 (less frequently 2–3) of the 1–6 embryo-sacs\r\nis fertile. The number of the carpels however varies. The fruit is a\r\n_1-seeded berry_, whose inner layer is changed into a _tough slimy\r\nmass_ (bird-lime), which serves to attach the fruits to other plants.\r\n\r\n   The two groups, _Loranthoideæ_ and _Viscoideæ_, are\r\n   distinguished by the fact that the former has a distinct\r\n   “calyculus,” _i.e._ an entire or lobed, or dentate swelling\r\n   on the receptacle below the perianth. The majority of the\r\n   Loranthoideæ have a petaloid perianth; in all the Viscoideæ, on\r\n   the other hand, it is sepaloid.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 542.--_Viscum album_: _A_ branch with leaves\r\n  and berries: _a_ scale-leaves; _b_ foliage-leaves; _n_ _m_ _n_\r\n  flowers; _B_ seedling, the bark of the branch being removed; _C_\r\n  an older embryo which still retains the cotyledons.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 543.--To the left the Rafflesiaceous _Cytinus\r\n  hypocistus_, parasitic on the roots of _Cistus_. To the right the\r\n  Balanophoraceous _Cynomorium coccineum_, parasitic on the roots\r\n  of _Salicornia_.]\r\n\r\nThe Mistletoe (_Viscum album_, Fig. 542) is a native, evergreen plant\r\nwhich may be found growing on almost any of our trees (sometimes on\r\nthe Oak), and, like other Loranthaceæ, it produces swellings of the\r\naffected branches. ~Its spherical white berries (Fig. 542 _A_) enclose\r\n(1–) 2–3 green embryos; they are eaten by birds (especially Thrushes),\r\nand are partly sown with their excrement, partly struck or brushed\r\noff the branches of the trees, the seed being enclosed, at maturity,\r\nby viscin, _i.e._ “bird-lime.” The seeds may also germinate on the\r\nbranches, without having first passed through the alimentary canal\r\nof the birds. On germination, the hypocotyl-axis first appears, as\r\nin Fig. 541, and bends towards the branch; the apex of the root then\r\nbroadens, and forms at the end a disc-like haustorium, from the centre\r\nof which a root-like body grows through the bark into the wood, and\r\nramifies between the bark and wood. Suckers are developed on the root\r\nlike strands which are formed in this manner, without, however, having\r\na rootcap; they are green, and penetrate the wood by the medullary\r\nrays (Fig. 542 _C_). Adventitious buds may also be developed from the\r\nroot-like strands which break through the bark and emerge as young\r\nplants. The young stem quickly ceases its longitudinal growth, and\r\nlateral shoots are developed from the axils of its foliage-leaves.\r\nThese and all following shoots have a similar structure; each of\r\nthem bears a pair of scale-leaves (Fig. 542 _A_, _a_) and a pair\r\nof foliage-leaves (Fig. 542 _A_, _b_), and then terminates its\r\ngrowth, if it does not produce an inflorescence; new lateral shoots\r\nproceed from the axils of the foliage-leaves, and the branching, in\r\nconsequence, is extremely regular and falsely dichotomous. Only one\r\ninternode (shoot-generation) is formed each year, so that each fork\r\nindicates one year. The foliage-leaves fall off in the second year.\r\nThe inflorescence is a 3(-5)-flowered dichasium (Fig. 542 _A_, _m_ is\r\nthe central flower, _n_ the lateral). The plants are _diœcious_; the\r\n♂-flower as a rule is 2-merous: perianth 2 + 2, each leaf of which\r\nbears on its inner side 6–20 pollen-sacs, each of which opens by a\r\npore; this relationship may be considered to have arisen from the union\r\nof the perianth-leaves with the multilocular stamens (2 + 2) placed\r\nopposite them. The ♀-flowers always have Pr 2 + 2, G2.--_Loranthus_\r\nis also found in Europe (it has a 3-merous flower), especially in\r\nthe central and south-eastern districts, on _Quercus cerris_ and _Q.\r\npubescens_; but the great majority of the 520 species grow in the\r\nTropics on trees which they ornament with their often brightly-coloured\r\nflowers, and ultimately kill when present in too great numbers. The\r\npollination in the numerous Loranthaceæ with unisexual flowers, is\r\neffected by the wind. In _Viscum album_ this takes place in autumn,\r\nthe actual fertilisation in the following spring, and the maturity in\r\nNovember or December; in the succeeding month of May the berry is ready\r\nto germinate, and falls off.~\r\n\r\n   USES. Birdlime from _Viscum album_.\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Rafflesiaceæ= and Order 5. =Balanophoraceæ=.\r\n   These orders comprise _root-parasites_, almost entirely\r\n   devoid of chlorophyll; they are reddish or yellow, without\r\n   foliage-leaves (Fig. 543). As far as our knowledge of these\r\n   rare tropical plants extends, they have thalloid organs of\r\n   vegetation resembling the root-like strands of _Viscum_, or\r\n   they are filamentous and branched like Fungus-hyphæ; they live\r\n   in and on the tissues of the host-plant, from which their\r\n   flowering-shoots, often of mushroom-like form, are subsequently\r\n   developed (Fig. 543). In order to unfold they must often break\r\n   through the tissues of the host-plant.\r\n\r\n   Of the RAFFLESIACEÆ, _Cytinus hypocistus_ is found in S. Europe\r\n   living on roots of _Cistus_-plants and to some extent resembling\r\n   _Monotropa_ (Fig. 543). _Rafflesia_ is the best known; it lives\r\n   on roots of _Cissus_-species (belonging to the Ampelidaceæ) in\r\n   Java; its yellowish-red, stinking flowers attain a gigantic\r\n   size (one metre or more in diameter), and are borne almost\r\n   directly on the roots of the host-plant. Besides these there\r\n   are other genera: _Brugmansia_, _Pilostyles_, _Hydnora_.--To\r\n   BALANOPHORACEÆ (Fig. 543) belong: _Balanophora_, _Langsdorffia_,\r\n   _Scybalium_, _Sarcophyte_, _Helosis_, etc., and in S. Europe,\r\n   _Cynomorium coccineum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Sub-Class 2. =Sympetalæ.=\r\n\r\nThe characters which separate this from the first Sub-class, the\r\nChoripetalæ, have been described on page 336. They consist in the\r\nfollowing: the flower is always verticillate, generally with =5=\r\nsepals, =5= petals, =5= stamens, and =2= carpels (in the median plane),\r\nthe calyx is generally persistent and gamosepalous, the corolla is\r\ngamopetalous and united to the stamens, which are therefore adnate to\r\nit, the ovules have only _one_ thick integument and a small nucellus.\r\n(The exceptions are noted later.)\r\n\r\n   This Sub-class is no doubt more recent than the Choripetalæ; it\r\n   is also peculiar in including fewer trees and shrubby forms than\r\n   the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Sympetalæ may be separated into 2 sections:--\r\n\r\n=A.= PENTACYCLICÆ (FIVE-WHORLED). The flowers in this section have\r\n5 _whorls equal in number_, namely, 2 staminal whorls in addition\r\nto the calyx, corolla, and carpels; in some instances, one of the\r\nstaminal whorls is rudimentary or entirely suppressed, but in this\r\ncase it is frequently the sepal-stamens which are suppressed, and\r\nthe whorl which is present stands opposite the petals. The flowers\r\nare regular. The _number of carpels equals that of the sepals_, but\r\nin one of the orders (_Bicornes_) they are opposite the petals (the\r\nflower being obdiplostemonous); in the other two orders (_Primulinæ_\r\nand _Diospyrinæ_) they are placed opposite the sepals (the flower\r\nbeing diplostemonous). This section is the most closely allied to the\r\nChoripetalæ, since the petals may sometimes be found entirely free,\r\nand the stamens inserted directly on the receptacle (Ericaceæ); ovules\r\nwith two integuments are also found. ~It is very doubtful, whether the\r\norders included under this head have any relationship with the other\r\nSympetalæ. They appear in any case to represent older types.~\r\n\r\n=B.= TETRACYCLICÆ (FOUR-WHORLED). The flowers have only 4 whorls,\r\nnamely, beside sepals, petals, and carpels, only one whorl of stamens,\r\nwhich alternates with the petals; there is no trace of the second\r\nstaminal whorl, and when the number of carpels is the same as that of\r\nthe preceding whorls (“isomerous”) they alternate with the stamens; but\r\nin most cases there are 2 _carpels placed in the median plane_ (see the\r\ndiagrams, _e.g._ Figs. 559, 567, 583, 590, etc.). This section is the\r\nlargest, and the one which shows the characteristics of the Sympetalæ\r\nbest. Very irregular flowers are met with.\r\n\r\nThe following families belong to the =Pentacyclicæ=: 26, _Bicornes_;\r\n27, _Diospyrinæ_; 28, _Primulinæ_.\r\n\r\nThe remaining families belonging to the =Tetracyclicæ= are:--\r\n\r\n=a.= HYPOGYNOUS flowers (with a few exceptions): 29, _Tubifloræ_; 30,\r\n_Personatæ_; 31, _Nuculiferæ_; 32, _Contortæ_.\r\n\r\n=b.= EPIGYNOUS flowers: 33, _Rubiales_; 34, _Dipsacales_; 35,\r\n_Campanulinæ_; 36, _Aggregatæ_. The ovaries and ovules in the last\r\nfamily are always reduced to one; and at the same time the fruits\r\nbecome nuts, and the flowers are united into crowded inflorescences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A. Pentacyclicæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 26. =Bicornes.=\r\n\r\nThis family is chiefly composed of shrubs, less frequently of small\r\ntrees, or perennial herbs; their leaves are undivided, most frequently\r\nevergreen, stiff and leathery, and always without stipules. The flowers\r\nare ☿ and _regular_, rarely slightly zygomorphic, most frequently\r\nobdiplostemonous, and 4- or 5-merous through all the 5 whorls. _The\r\nstamens are attached to the receptacle_, and as a rule are quite\r\nfree from the petals, an attachment which is very rare among the\r\nGamopetalæ. They have a simple gynœceum with _one_ undivided style, a\r\ncommissural stigma, and a _multilocular_ ovary, whose axile placentæ\r\nproject considerably into the loculi, and bear a large number of\r\novules. ~The placentæ are sometimes not united, and in consequence, the\r\novary is 1-locular with incomplete partition-walls, _e.g._ _Pyrola_,\r\n_Monotropa_.~ Embryo straight, with endosperm. _The carpels are placed\r\nopposite the petals._\r\n\r\nThe _diagram_ is generally Sn, Pn, An + n, Gn, in which n is 4 or 5. To\r\nthis may be added, that the _corolla is in most cases gamopetalous_,\r\nbut in some (especially _Pyrolaceæ_) perfectly polypetalous; and that\r\nthe _anthers usually open by pores_, and often have _two horn-like_\r\nappendages (hence the name “Bicornes”) (Figs. 545, 546); frequently\r\nthe two halves of the anther are also widely separated from each other\r\nat the upper end, so that the pores are placed each one at the end of\r\nits own tube (Fig. 546); the pollen-grains in the majority are united\r\ninto _tetrads_ (Fig. 542 _D_).--The flowers, as a rule, are pendulous\r\nand borne in racemes, coloured (red or white), but odourless. When the\r\nfruit is a capsule, the placenta with the seeds attached persists as a\r\ncentral column. A _mycorhiza_ occurs on many.\r\n\r\nThe majority of plants belonging to this family inhabit cold and\r\ntemperate countries, or high mountains in tropical regions; they prefer\r\ncold and dry or damp places (bogs, heaths, etc.). Plentiful in N.\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Pyrolaceæ.= Perennial _herbs_; _petals most frequently\r\nquite free from each other_, and falling off singly after flowering;\r\n_the anthers are without appendages_, and open by pores (Fig. 544),\r\nor by a transverse slit. The placentæ are thick. The seeds in the\r\n_capsule-like_ fruit (loculicidal dehiscence) are exceedingly small and\r\nlight, they have a sac-like testa which loosely envelops them, an oily\r\nendosperm, and an _extremely simple embryo_, which consists only of an\r\nellipsoidal, cellular mass, without cotyledons or differentiation into\r\nplumule and radicle.\r\n\r\n_Pyrola_ (Winter-green) is green, and has also large evergreen\r\nfoliage-leaves. The flowers, 5-merous, are most frequently borne in\r\nracemes without a terminal flower; the anthers are extrorse in the bud\r\nwith the pores in the lower portion (Fig. 544 _A_), but they become\r\ninverted at a later period, so that the pores open at the top (Fig.\r\n544 _C_). ~_P. uniflora_ has a single, terminal flower; it winters by\r\nits roots, producing from these in the spring aerial, quite unbranched\r\nshoots. _Chimaphila umbellata._~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 544.--_Pyrola minor_: _A_ portions of a\r\n  young flower; _B_ the stigma; _C_ portions of an older flower\r\n  (longitudinal section).]\r\n\r\n_Monotropa_ (Yellow Bird’s-nest) is very pale yellow, without\r\nchlorophyll, succulent, and has only scale-like leaves closely pressed\r\nupon the stem; it is a saprophyte. The raceme has a terminal flower,\r\nand is pendulous before flowering. The anthers open by a semicircular,\r\ntransverse cleft. ~_M. hypopitys_ reproduces chiefly by root-shoots.~\r\n\r\n   About 30 species, especially N. Europe, N. America, and N. Asia.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Ericaceæ.= The flower (Fig. 545) is _hypogynous_, the median\r\nsepal posterior; corolla, _gamopetalous_; the stamens are generally\r\n_2-horned_, and the fruit is a _capsule_, less frequently a berry or\r\ndrupe. At the base of the ovary is a nectar-secreting disc (Fig. 545\r\n_B_). This order comprises shrubs or undershrubs (rarely small trees),\r\nwhich are evergreen, and as a rule have densely crowded leaves.\r\n\r\n=1.= ERICEÆ, HEATH GROUP. Flowers most frequently _4-merous_ (S4,\r\nP4, A4 + 4, G4, united in a 4-locular gynœceum), rarely 5-merous.\r\nThe withered corolla _persists_ after flowering. The leaves are most\r\nfrequently acicular, opposite or verticillate; the buds are without\r\nscales. The fruit is a capsule.--_Calluna_ (_C. vulgaris_, Ling) has\r\na deeply 4-cleft corolla, which is less than the coloured calyx;\r\ncapsule with septicidal dehiscence.--_Erica_ (about 420 species; _E.\r\ntetralix_, Cross-leaved Heath) has a tubular or bell-shaped, 4-dentate\r\ncorolla, which is much longer than the calyx. Capsule with loculicidal\r\ndehiscence.--_Pentapera._\r\n\r\n=2.= ANDROMEDEÆ. The flowers are 5-merous (S5, P5, A5 + 5, G5),\r\nwith _deciduous_ corolla. Capsule with loculicidal dehiscence. The\r\nleaves are scattered, and incline more to the ordinary broad-leaved\r\nforms.--_Andromeda_; _Gaultheria_; _Cassandra (Lyonia)_; _Cassiope_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 545.--_Arctostaphylos uva-ursi._]\r\n\r\n=3.= ARBUTEÆ. The flowers as in the preceding group (Fig. 545), but the\r\nfruit is a berry or drupe. _Arctostaphylos_ (_A. uva-ursi_, Bear-berry)\r\nhas a drupe with 5 stones in a dry, farinaceous pulp; in other\r\nspecies there is 1 stone with several loculi. _Arbutus_ (_A. unedo_,\r\nStrawberry-tree) has a spherical berry.\r\n\r\n   _Pollination_ is effected by means of insects, especially by\r\n   bees. The pollen is light and dry, and is shaken out through\r\n   the pores of the anthers when the insects agitate the horn-like\r\n   appendages during their visits. Self-pollination takes place,\r\n   no doubt, in many cases.--800 species; the very large genus,\r\n   _Erica_, especially in S. Africa (the Cape).--OFFICINAL: the\r\n   leaves of _Arctostaphylos uva ursi_. _Arbutus unedo_ (S. Europe)\r\n   has an edible, peculiarly warted (strawberry-like) fruit. Many\r\n   _Erica_-species are cultivated as ornamental plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Rhodoraceæ= (=Rhododendrons=). This differs from the\r\npreceding order in the _median sepal being anterior_, and hence the\r\nposition of the other floral whorls is also reversed. The flower is\r\n_hypogynous_, in most cases 5-merous; the corolla is most frequently\r\ndeeply cleft or polypetalous, and falls off after flowering; the\r\nanthers open by pores, and have _no horn-like appendages_. _Capsule_\r\nwith _septicidal_ dehiscence.--The shrubs or small trees belonging to\r\nthis order have, like the Vaccineæ, ordinary foliage-leaves, and the\r\nbuds are generally provided with _large bud-scales_.\r\n\r\n_Rhododendron_ has 10 stamens, and a slightly zygomorphic flower with\r\ndeeply 5-cleft corolla (the section _Azalea_ has frequently only 5\r\nstamens, the petal-stamens being absent). They are Alpine plants (200\r\nspecies) in the mountains of Asia, especially the Himalayas; some in\r\nS. Europe.--_Menziesia._--_Ledum_; small, rusty-brown, hairy shrubs\r\nwith polypetalous, expanded, star-like corolla.--_Kalmia_ (N. Am.) has\r\na cupular corolla, with 10 small, pocket-like depressions in which\r\nthe anthers are concealed until the arched, elastic filaments are\r\nfreed from this position by means of the insects, when they quickly\r\nstraighten themselves in the centre of the flower.--_Phyllodoce_;\r\n_Loiseleuria_ (5 stamens); (_Clethra_ (?); also placed among the\r\nTernstrœmiaceæ).\r\n\r\n   About 270 species. Several species are ornamental plants.\r\n   Several plants of the order are more or less _narcotic_. _Ledum\r\n   palustre_ has been used as a substitute for hops.\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Diapensiaceæ.= Hypogynous flower. 3 floral-leaves\r\n   beneath the flower (S5, P5, A5 + 0, G3). Stamens on the throat\r\n   of the corolla. Pollen-grains single. Disc absent. Capsule\r\n   loculicidal.--9 species from the Arctic regions. It is doubtful\r\n   whether this order should be included in the Bicornes; perhaps\r\n   it would be more correctly assigned to the _Polemoniaceæ_.\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Epacridaceæ.= This order comprises those species of\r\n   the family which are confined to Australia and the South Sea\r\n   Islands. They are shrub-like plants, resembling the Ericaceæ in\r\n   habit, in the inflorescence, and in the structure, form, and\r\n   colour of the flower. They differ especially in having only\r\n   1 _whorl of stamens_ (placed opposite the sepals) and in the\r\n   anthers having only 2 loculi, and opening by a longitudinal\r\n   slit. Fruit most frequently a drupe (or loculicidal capsule).\r\n   _Epacris_-and _Styphelia_-species are ornamental plants. About\r\n   325 species.\r\n\r\nOrder 6. =Vacciniaceæ= (=Bilberries=). _The flower_ (Fig. 546) _is\r\nepigynous, the corolla gamopetalous_, and _the fruit a berry_. The\r\nlatter is most frequently spherical, and bears on its apex the calyx,\r\nwhich is generally very low, almost entire, and with a _disc-like\r\nexpansion_ inside. The flower is 4- or 5-merous (Fig. 546 _B_, _D_). The\r\nanthers have 2 pores, and are most frequently 2-horned (Fig. 546 _F_,\r\n_G_). Small shrubs; the leaves are scattered, not needle-like.\r\n\r\n_Vaccinium_ (Bilberry, Whortleberry) has an urceolate, gamopetalous,\r\nonly slightly dentate corolla, and horn-like appendages to the anthers\r\n(Fig. 546). ~_V. vitis idæa_ (Cowberry) is evergreen, with flowers in\r\nracemes, and bright red berries; _V. myrtillus_ (Bilberry) and _V.\r\nuliginosum_ (Bog Whortleberry) both have black berries with a blue\r\nbloom, leaves deciduous.~--_Oxycoccus_ has a _polypetalous_ corolla\r\nwith the petals projecting backwards. Anthers without appendages. ~_O.\r\npalustris_ (Cranberry) has a slender, creeping stem, and is evergreen.\r\nDark red berry.~\r\n\r\n   Pollination essentially the same as the preceding order.--320\r\n   species; especially in N. Am. Some are useful on account of\r\n   their edible fruits, especially _Vaccinium myrtillus_ and _V.\r\n   vitis-idæa_, and in a less degree _Oxycoccus_, etc. The fruits\r\n   of _V. myrtillus_ are _officinal_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 546.--_Vaccinium uliginosum_ (var.\r\n  _microphyllum_). The parts of the flower _A-E_ are enlarged 5–6\r\n  times; _C_ and _E_ are longitudinal sections; _B_ and _D_ the\r\n  flower seen from above; _F_ and _G_ a stamen seen from the back\r\n  and front; _H_ the style and stigma.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 27. =Diospyrinæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers are _regular_, gamopetalous, typically diplostemonous,\r\nwith the same number throughout all 5 whorls, thus: Sn, Pn, An + n,\r\nGn, where n most frequently =5 (4–6), rarely 3, 7 or 8. Of the two\r\nwhorls of stamens the one opposite the sepals is often present only\r\nas rudiments or is entirely suppressed, and the completely developed\r\n_stamens are thus placed opposite the petals_. The carpels are\r\ngenerally placed opposite the sepals. The _ovary is multilocular_ with\r\nthe ovules attached in the inner angles. The fruit is most frequently\r\na _berry_. The seeds are large, generally solitary, or a few in each\r\nloculus.--All plants belonging to this family are _trees_ or shrubs\r\nwith _scattered_, _single_, _most frequently entire_, _penninerved_ and\r\n_leathery_ leaves without stipules; the majority are tropical (America,\r\nAsia), some are found in N. Am. and the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Sapotaceæ.= Plants with latex; anthers extrorse, 1\r\n   _erect_ ovule in each loculus; fruit a berry; the seeds with\r\n   bony, shiny brown testa have a large, lateral hilum. The leaves\r\n   are frequently covered with silky hairs.--A useful order in\r\n   several respects (400 tropical species). The wood of some\r\n   genera, such as _Sideroxylon_ (Iron wood) and _Bumelia_, is as\r\n   hard as iron. The latex of _Palaquium_ (_P. oblongifolium_, _P.\r\n   gutta_, and other species), _Mimusops_ and _Payena_ (Sumatra,\r\n   E. Ind.), is the raw material of _gutta percha_. The following\r\n   have very delicious fruits: _Lucuma mammosa_, _Achras sapota_,\r\n   _Chrysophyllum cainito_ (Star-apple), etc. The seeds of _Bassia_\r\n   (E. Ind.) contain a large quantity of a fatty oil. _Isonandra_,\r\n   _Mimusops schimperi_ are often found in the Egyptian royal tombs.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Ebenaceæ.= Plants without latex, often diœcious;\r\n   flowers with a more or less leathery perianth. The number of\r\n   stamens is sometimes increased (by splitting?); ovules 1–2,\r\n   _pendulous_ in each loculus. Fruit a berry.--250 species;\r\n   chiefly tropical. Some are well known on account of their\r\n   hard and black-coloured heart-wood, _e.g._ _Maba ebenus_ (the\r\n   Moluccas) and _Diospyros ebenum_ (Ebony-wood, from Tropical\r\n   Asia) and others.--The fruits are edible _e.g._ of _Diospyros\r\n   lotus_ (Date-plum, Asia), which is also cultivated as an\r\n   ornamental shrub, together with several other species.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Styracaceæ.= The flower is more or less _epigynous_,\r\n   and the corolla is almost _polypetalous_. The stamens (by\r\n   splitting?) are more than double the number of the petals, and\r\n   often united at the base. Stellate hairs are frequent.--235\r\n   species; Tropical Asia and America, a few for example in the\r\n   East.--OFFICINAL: Gum-benzoin from _Styrax benzoin_ and perhaps\r\n   other species (Sumatra and Siam). _Halesia tetraptera_ (N. Am.)\r\n   is an ornamental shrub with 4-winged fruits.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 547.--Diagram of _Primula_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 28. =Primulinæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers are _regular_, ☿, _hypogynous_, and gamopetalous. The\r\n_stamens_ are _equal in number_ to the petals (Fig. 547) and _are\r\nplaced opposite to them_. The ovary is _unilocular_, with _a free,\r\ncentral_ placenta with 1–many ovules.--The flower is a further\r\ndevelopment of the Diospyrinæ; the suppression of the calyx-stamens,\r\nwhich commenced in this family, is carried further in the Primulinæ,\r\nso that in the majority of cases no trace of them is present, but\r\nin certain species and genera (_Samolus_, _Lysimachia thyrsiflora_,\r\n_Soldanella_, certain Myrsineæ) some small bodies (scales, teeth,\r\netc.) are found in the position of the suppressed stamens. Again, the\r\nlateral portions of the carpels are suppressed, so that the _ventral\r\nplacentæ_ with the ovules are separated from the dorsal portions, and\r\n_are united into a free central placenta_; this theory is supported by\r\nthe branching of the vascular bundles, the development, and various\r\ncomparative considerations.--Sn, Pn, A0 + n, Gn; where n = 4–8,\r\ngenerally 5. The carpels are placed opposite the sepals (Fig. 547).\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Primulaceæ= (=Primroses=). This order has _many ovules_\r\nattached to a _thick, free, central placenta_ (Fig. 547); _style\r\nundivided_ with a _capitate_ stigma; ovules semi-anatropous; fruit a\r\n_capsule_ with many seeds.\r\n\r\nAll the plants belonging to this order are _herbs_; stipules wanting;\r\nthe flower is most frequently 5-merous (S5, P5, A0 + 5, G5; except\r\n_Centunculus_ and _Trientalis_). The corolla and capsule have various\r\nforms, but the capsule generally opens by teeth at the apex. The ovules\r\nare semi-anatropous (in _Hottonia_ they are anatropous), and the seeds\r\nare therefore _peltate_, with the hilum situated in the centre of one\r\nside. The endosperm is fleshy or horny. The flowers are borne either in\r\nracemes or in umbels; as _bracteoles are typically_ absent (Fig. 547),\r\ncymose branching does not occur.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 548.--_Primula_: dimorphic flowers. _A_\r\n  short-styled; _B_ long-styled.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 549.--_Cyclamen persicum._]\r\n\r\n_Primula_ (Primrose) has most frequently a vertical rhizome, bearing\r\na rosette of leaves at its summit, and long-stalked umbels; corolla\r\n_rotate_ or slightly funnel-shaped; the capsule opens at the apex by 5\r\n_teeth_. The flowers in some species are heterostyled (long-styled or\r\nshort-styled; Fig. 548). Closely allied are _Androsace_ (with ovate,\r\ncup-shaped corolla-tube and ligular scales, alternating with the\r\ncorolla-lobes) and _Soldanella_ (funnel-shaped corolla with laciniate\r\nlobes and most frequently ligular scales).--_Hottonia_ (Water-Violet)\r\nis an aquatic plant with pectinate leaves and heterostyled\r\nflowers.--_Cortusa._ _Dodecatheon._ _Cyclamen_ (Fig. 549) has solitary,\r\nlong-stalked flowers, and a rotate corolla with the lobes reflexed; the\r\nstalk of the capsule rolls up spirally; the tuberous rhizome is formed\r\nby the hypocotyledonary internode. Only 1 cotyledon.--_Lysimachia_\r\n(Money-wort); stem-internodes well developed, leaves opposite or\r\nverticillate, calyx almost polysepalous, corolla deeply 5-partite (Fig.\r\n550). The flowers are solitary or in racemes.--_Anagallis_ (Pimpernel),\r\nleaves opposite, flowers solitary; the fruit a pyxidium (Fig. 551);\r\nsimilarly in _Centunculus_, which is 4-merous.--_Trientalis_, the\r\nflowers are most frequently 7-merous.--_Glaux_ (Sea Milk-wort) is a\r\ncreeping maritime plant with opposite leaves; flowers solitary in the\r\nleaf-axils, _corolla absent_, but with coloured calyx. ~The petals are\r\nusually developed later than the stamens in the Primulaceæ; but in\r\nthis instance they are entirely suppressed.~--_Samolus_ (Brookweed)\r\ndiffers from all the others in having an _epigynous_ flower;\r\nbarren sepal-stamens are also present. The bracts in the racemose\r\ninflorescences are displaced along the flower-stalks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 550.--_Lysimachia thyrsiflora._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 551.--_Anagallis arvensis._ Fruit dehiscing.]\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. Insect-pollination in the majority;\r\n   cross-pollination is promoted in some by heterostyly (Fig.\r\n   548).--300 species; especially in northern temperate zones;\r\n   the majority on mountains (_Soldanella_, _Androsace_, etc.);\r\n   almost absent in the Tropics. A large number are ORNAMENTAL\r\n   PLANTS, _e.g._ _Primula auricula_ (from the Alps), _P. sinensis_\r\n   (China), _P. elatior_ (Oxslip, a native) and _grandiflora_, etc.\r\n   _Cyclamen europæum_ (Alpine Violet); the tubers are poisonous.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Myrsinaceæ.= Trees or shrubs; evergreen, tropical\r\n   Primulaceæ with fleshy fruits and few seeds, embedded in the\r\n   placenta. The leaves are nearly always dotted with yellow\r\n   glands (schizogenous resin-receptacles).--550 species;\r\n   especially Am.--ORNAMENTAL PLANTS: _Ardisia crenulata_ (W.\r\n   Ind.); other genera: _Clavija_, _Maesa_, _Theophrasta_ (barren\r\n   sepal-stamens), _Myrsine_, _Jacquinia_ (barren sepal-stamens),\r\n   etc.--_Ægiceras_, allied to this order, comprises arborescent\r\n   plants, often growing with _Rhizophora_ in tropical forests,\r\n   along the shore. The embryo germinates while still in the fruit.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Plumbaginaceæ.= This order has a position of the stamens\r\nsimilar to that in Primulaceæ (S5, P5, A0 + 5, G5), but it differs\r\nfrom these in the flower, which has generally a _membranous_, dry,\r\nthin, coloured, folded, almost entire calyx and an _almost entirely\r\npolypetalous corolla_, which, as a rule, has twisted æstivation and is\r\n_only united_ with the stamens _at its base_; but more especially it\r\ndiffers in the ovary, which bears 5 _free_ or almost free _styles_ and\r\nonly 1 _basal_ ovule with a _long_, twisted funicle (the placenta of\r\nthe Primulaceæ is here so much reduced that it bears only 1 ovule).\r\nThe fruit is a _nut_ or _capsule_. The radicle is turned outwards.\r\nEndosperm mealy.--To this order belong herbs or under-shrubs, which\r\nare especially natives of the sea-coast and of salt-steppes; they also\r\nresemble the Primulaceæ in the scattered, undivided, entire leaves\r\n(without stipules), often in rosettes, and the inflorescence borne\r\non a long stalk. In opposition to the Primulaceæ, the _bracteoles\r\nare typically present, and hence the branching is generally cymose_\r\n(scorpioid).\r\n\r\n_Armeria_ (Thrift) has a round _capitulum_, composed of closely-packed\r\ndichasia, surrounded at its base by an involucre with peculiar\r\nprolongations, directed downwards, and united into a sheath protecting\r\nthe intercalary zone of growth. The pericarp is finally ruptured at\r\nthe base, and drops off like a hood.--In _Statice_ (Sea-lavender), the\r\nunipared scorpioid cymes are prolonged and collected into panicle-like\r\ninflorescences.--~_Plumbago_ is the genus which approaches nearest to\r\nthe Primulaceæ, and differs most from the characters given above. It\r\nhas capitate or spike-like inflorescences, a salver-shaped corolla, and\r\nthe stamens are not attached to the corolla. The style is only divided\r\nat the extremity; the calyx is not membranous, but is covered with\r\nsticky, glandular hairs.~\r\n\r\n   250 species; chiefly in the Mediterranean and about the Caspian\r\n   Sea, on salt-steppes and beaches. Some are Tropical; a few are\r\n   ornamental plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           B. Tetracyclicæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n               a. Tetracyclicæ with hypogynous flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 29. =Tubifloræ.=\r\n\r\nThe flower is regular, ☿, and _hypogynous_. The gamopetalous type is\r\npresent in this family with great uniformity, without suppression\r\nor splitting; S5, P5, A5, G2 (3–5). The stamens are all fertile,\r\nalternating with the lobes of the corolla. Gynœceum with 2, more\r\nseldom 3–5 syncarpous carpels. Style nearly always simple; 2 dorsal\r\nstigmas. In each carpel 2–∞ ovules. At the base of the ovary is found\r\na yellowish ring-like nectary (Fig. 552 C), sometimes 5-sinuate or\r\n5-partite.--The leaves are nearly always scattered; stipules are\r\nabsent.--~The Solanaceæ, which formerly were classed here, are so\r\nclosely allied to the Personatæ, that it would be unnatural not to\r\nplace them first in this family; and the Boraginaceæ (which were also\r\nplaced in the Tubifloræ) appear to be best united, with the Labiatæ and\r\nothers, into one family Nuculiferæ.~\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Polemoniaceæ.= The flowers are regular; S5, P5,\r\n   A5, G3. The calyx and corolla have united leaves, the petals\r\n   _twisted_ to the right in _æstivation_ (all the left edges\r\n   being covered). The ovary is 3-locular with 2–∞ ovules in\r\n   each loculus; the style is trifid at the apex; the fruit\r\n   is a 3-valved capsule. Embryo straight; endosperm fleshy.\r\n   The inflorescences are dichasia passing over into unipared\r\n   helicoid cymes (the shoot of the _lower_ bracteole being the\r\n   more strongly developed).--Herbs without latex. 150 species;\r\n   especially Western N. Am.--_Phlox_ (salver-shaped corolla;\r\n   entire, opposite leaves), _Polemonium_ (campanulate or almost\r\n   rotate corolla; scattered, pinnate leaves), _Leptosiphon_,\r\n   _Gilia_, _Collomia_, _Cobæa_ (climbing, like the Vetches, by\r\n   tendrils at the ends of the leaves), etc. They are frequently\r\n   ornamental plants.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Hydrophyllaceæ.= This order approaches very closely to\r\n   the Boraginaceæ. Herbs with pinnate or palmate leaves; S5, P5,\r\n   A5, G2. The lobes of the corolla are imbricate in æstivation.\r\n   Generally 2 median carpels. The ovary is _most frequently\r\n   unilocular_, and the seeds are situated on 2 _parietal\r\n   placentæ_; capsule 2-valved; embryo straight; endosperm fleshy.\r\n   In the corolla-tube, opposite the corolla-lobes, there are\r\n   frequently appendages of various forms, which resemble those of\r\n   _Cuscuta_. The inflorescences correspond exactly with those of\r\n   the Boraginaceæ, being _unipared scorpioid cymes_, which, prior\r\n   to opening, _are tightly rolled up_.--130 species, especially in\r\n   N. Am. (California, etc.). Many annual species of _Phacelia_,\r\n   _Nemophila_, _Whitlavia_, _Eutoca_, _Cosmanthus_, etc., are\r\n   cultivated in gardens as ornamental plants. _Hydrolea_ (has a\r\n   bilocular ovary, and two free styles).\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Convolvulaceæ= (=Bindweeds=). The flower is regular,\r\nhypogynous, with 5 almost free sepals (quincuncial æstivation), P5,\r\nA5, G2 (rarely 3–5). The _corolla_ is very characteristic; it is\r\n(with various forms) almost entire, or slightly 5-lobed, and _folded_\r\nlongitudinally _in the bud_ in such a way that 5 projecting, flat\r\nportions, tapering towards the top and frequently differing in colour\r\nand hairiness from the rest, are visible externally and applied close\r\ntogether, while the remainder of the corolla is folded inwards (Fig.\r\n552 A); and hence the whole corolla is _strongly twisted to the right_\r\nin the bud. The gynœceum most frequently has a bilocular ovary; _in\r\neach loculus_ there are _only_ 2 (erect) _anatropous ovules_ on the\r\nplacenta, which is not especially thickened (Fig. 552 _D_, _E_); each\r\nloculus is sometimes divided into two by a false septum (a relationship\r\nwith the _Boraginaceæ_, etc.); style simple with most frequently a\r\nbilobed stigma, or a bipartite style. The fruit is nearly spherical,\r\nmost frequently a _capsule_. The seeds are erect, and have a large\r\nhilum at the base. The embryo is _curved_, with leaf-like, thin,\r\nbilobed, most frequently folded cotyledons; _endosperm absent or\r\nmucilaginous_.\r\n\r\n=1.= CONVOLVULEÆ, BINDWEED GROUP. The majority are _twining_ (to\r\nthe left) _herbs_, with _latex_. The leaves are scattered, without\r\nstipules, often long stalked, and nearly always with cordate base;\r\nsome are palmately lobed. The flowers are most frequently solitary\r\nin the leaf-axils, large, quickly withering.--_Convolvulus_ (Fig.\r\n552), _Calystegia_ (unilocular ovary, 2 large bracteoles), _Ipomœa_,\r\n_Batatas_, _Evolvulus_ (with a doubly bifid style), _Calonyction_,\r\n_Pharbitis_, etc.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 552.--_Convolvulus scammonia._]\r\n\r\n=2.= DICHONDREÆ. This group is a more primitive form, not twining,\r\nand without latex. It has 2 _free_ carpels with basal style (as in\r\nBoraginaceæ) and valvate corolla.\r\n\r\n=3.= CUSCUTEÆ, DODDER GROUP (Fig. 553). Parasites, with round,\r\nfilamentous stems, bearing only scale-like leaves and almost destitute\r\nof chlorophyll (they are reddish or yellowish); they are parasitic\r\nupon other plants, around which they twine, first with narrow, compact\r\ncoils from which haustoria (Fig. 553 _A_) are developed which enter the\r\nhost-plant, and then with wider coils by which they raise themselves\r\nto other portions of their host or try to reach other plants. On\r\ngermination a very temporary primary root is developed, which bears\r\nroot-hairs as far as the tip (rootcap is wanting); it only serves as a\r\nkind of reservoir for water, and perishes very soon after the seedling\r\nhas fastened on to a host. The embryo is filamentous and rolled up\r\n_spirally_ (Fig. 553 _C_), and is sometimes destitute of cotyledons.\r\nThe flowers are crowded into capitulate inflorescences, complicated\r\nby accessory shoots (Fig. 553 _A_); they have S5, P5 (_imbricate_\r\næstivation), A5 (and beneath the stamens 5 scales on the corolla-tube),\r\nG2. Fruit a capsule opening by a lid.--_Cuscuta europœa_, _C.\r\nepilinum_ (Flax-Dodder), _C. epithymum_ (Lesser-Dodder), _C. trifolii_\r\n(Clover-Dodder), etc., are parasitic on different hosts, or parasitic\r\neach on its own particular host.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 553.--_Cuscuta trifolii_, parasitic on Red\r\n  Clover. _A_ A portion of the stem with an inflorescence and\r\n  haustoria (mag.); _B_ seed (nat. size); _C_ seed (mag.); _D_\r\n  embryo (nat. size).]\r\n\r\n   840 species; the majority in the Tropics, especially Am. Many\r\n   are ornamental plants. OFFICINAL: some on account of their\r\n   purgative properties: the tuberous roots of _Ipomæa purga_\r\n   (Jalap, from Mexico) and the dried latex (“Scammony”) of\r\n   _Convolvulus scammonia_ (from the East). The tuberous roots of\r\n   _Batatas edulis_ (Trop. S. Am.) are used as a common vegetable\r\n   (Sweet Potato) in the Tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 30. =Personatæ.=\r\n\r\nThe type of the flower is: S5, P5, A5 (of which one, or in some cases\r\nseveral, are suppressed), and G2. The flowers are _hypogynous_, ☿,\r\nperfect with gamopetalous corolla, but most frequently irregular\r\n(medianly zygomorphic, except _Solanaceæ_), the _corolla_ being\r\n_bilabiate_ (divided into a posterior part of two lobes and an anterior\r\npart of three lobes), and the _stamens_ 4, _didynamous_ (the posterior\r\nbeing suppressed). The ovary has 2 loculi (only 1 in _Utriculariaceæ_,\r\n_Gesneriaceæ_, _Orobanche_); the placenta in the first-named orders\r\n(1–7) is most frequently very thick, and bears a _great many ovules_\r\n(Figs. 554, 555, 557, 562); the number of ovules in the last orders\r\n(8–9) is considerably reduced (Fig. 570).\r\n\r\nSpecial mention may be made of the apparently 4-merous flower which\r\nis found, _e.g._ in _Veronica_ and _Plantago_ (Figs. 567, 562 _C_,\r\n570, 571), and which arises from the typical 5-merous flower by the\r\nsuppression of the posterior sepal and the posterior stamen, and by\r\nthe union of the two posterior petals into one.--Terminal flowers\r\nvery seldom occur on the main axis, and would not harmonise well\r\nwith the very irregular form of the flower. When they do occur, they\r\nare, as a rule, “peloric,” _i.e._ regular (in _Linaria vulgaris_ two\r\nkinds of peloric flowers occur,--one with 5 spurs, and one without\r\nspurs). The halves of the anthers are often divided as far as the\r\nbase, and laterally so widely separated from each other as to assume\r\nan almost straight line (Figs. 563, 564). There is generally a nectary\r\n(“disc”) round the base of the ovary, often 5-lobed (or divided into\r\nfree glands).--A common vegetative characteristic is the _absence of\r\nstipules_.\r\n\r\n   The 9 orders of the Personatæ are: 1, Solanaceæ; 2, Nolanaceæ;\r\n   3, Scrophulariaceæ; 4, Utriculariaceæ; 5, Gesneriaceæ; 6,\r\n   Bignoniaceæ; 7, Pedaliaceæ; 8, Acanthaceæ; 9, Plantaginaceæ.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 554.--Diagram of _Petunia_.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Solanaceæ.= The flower (Figs. 554, 555, 559) is hypogynous,\r\nregular (zygomorphic in _Hyoscyamus_), ☿, and gamopetalous, with\r\nS5, P5 (most frequently _imbricate_ or _valvate_), A5, G2, the 2\r\ncarpels being placed obliquely (Fig. 554); the bilocular ovary has a\r\nvery _thick axile placenta_ (Figs. 554, 555 _H_, 557), which extends\r\nalmost as far as the wall of the ovary. The fruit is a capsule\r\nor berry; the seeds are more or less reniform, and the embryo is\r\n_curved_ (rarely straight), in a fleshy endosperm (Figs. 555 _F_, _G_;\r\n561).--Both arborescent and herbaceous forms are found in the order;\r\nleaves scattered without stipules, but with variously formed laminæ\r\n(always penninerved). _A peculiar leaf-arrangement_ is found in many\r\nspecies, viz. the leaves are borne _in pairs, a large and a smaller\r\none together_; these pairs stand in 2 rows, and the flowers are then\r\nsituated _between_ the individual leaves in each pair, apparently _not_\r\nin a leaf axil. The inflorescences are frequently unipared scorpioid\r\ncymes without floral-leaves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 555.--_Atropa belladonna_: _A_ is reduced.]\r\n\r\n   Zygomorphic flowers occur, and thus form a transition to the\r\n   closely allied Scrophulariaceæ; the zygomorphy sometimes\r\n   shows itself only in the relative length of the stamens,\r\n   sometimes also in the corolla (_Hyoscyamus_).--_Nicandra_ is\r\n   5-merous throughout all the whorls.--The peculiar relative\r\n   _leaf-arrangement_ in this order occurs from sympodial branching\r\n   and displacement. The most simple is, _e.g._ _Datura_ (Fig. 556\r\n   _A_); each shoot-generation in the floral parts of the plant has\r\n   only 2 foliage-leaves (_f^1_ and _f^2_), and then terminates\r\n   in a flower; the axillary buds of both the foliage-leaves\r\n   are developed and form a dichasium, but since the leaves are\r\n   displaced on their axillary-shoots as far, or almost as far, as\r\n   the first leaf of these axillary-shoots, the flowers are borne\r\n   singly on the dichasial branches, and all the branches appear to\r\n   be without subtending leaves (Shoot I is white, II shaded, III\r\n   white, etc., diagram _A_). _Scopolia_ and others (Fig. 556 _B_)\r\n   differ in that the lowest and smallest (_f^1_) of the two leaves\r\n   on each shoot is barren, and is therefore not displaced; but the\r\n   upper one (the second bracteole, _f^2_) is displaced as in the\r\n   first instance, and consequently it assumes a position near the\r\n   first leaf (the shaded leaf _f^2_ of shoot I being placed near\r\n   the white leaf _f^1_ of shoot II, etc.,) of the next youngest\r\n   shoot-generation, and hence the leaves are borne in pairs; the\r\n   flower placed between the two leaves of a pair is therefore the\r\n   terminal flower of the shoot to which the smaller of the two\r\n   leaves belongs, and the larger leaf is the subtending leaf for\r\n   the floral shoot itself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 556.--Diagrammatic representation of the\r\n  branching in Solanaceæ. The various shoot-generations are white\r\n  or shaded.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 557.--Fruit of _Hyoscyamus niger_ after\r\n  removal of calyx.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 558.--Fruit of _Datura stramonium_.]\r\n\r\n=A.= FRUIT A CAPSULE. _Nicotiana_ (Tobacco) has a 2-valved capsule with\r\nseptifragal dehiscence; the valves separate at the apex; the corolla is\r\nfunnel-shaped, tubular, salver-shaped or campanulate. The flowers in\r\npanicles.--_Datura_ (_D. stramonium_, Thorn-apple) has a (frequently\r\nspiny) capsule (Fig. 558), which is _falsely 4-locular_ (at the top,\r\nbilocular) and opens septifragally with 4 valves. The lower part of\r\nthe calyx persists as a thick collar (see Fig. 558). The corolla\r\nis funnel-shaped. The flowers are solitary, large.--_Hyoscyamus_\r\n(_H. niger_, Henbane) has a pyxidium (Fig. 557) enclosed in the\r\ncampanulate, completely persistent, thick-walled calyx. The flowers\r\nare slightly _zygomorphic_, and borne in unipared scorpioid cymes.\r\n~_Scopolia_ (pyxidium); _Fabiana_ (Heather-like shrub); _Petunia_\r\n(slightly zygomorphic flower; funnel-shaped corolla); _Nierembergia_;\r\n_Brunfelsia_ (almost a drupe); _Franciscea_; _Browallia_.~--Among\r\nthose with capsular fruits are found the most anomalous forms, which\r\nby their zygomorphic flowers and often didynamous stamens present the\r\ntransition to the Scrophulariaceæ: _Salpiglossis_; _Schizanthus_ (lobed\r\npetals; 2 perfect, and 3 rudimentary stamens).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 559–561.--_Solanum tuberosum._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 559.--Flower (1/1).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 560.--Stamen, ejecting pollen.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 561.--Longitudinal section of seed.]\r\n\r\n=B.= FRUIT A BERRY. _Solanum_ (Nightshade); rotate corolla (Fig.\r\n559). The stamens have short filaments, the anthers stand erect,\r\nclose together round the style, like a cone in the centre of the\r\nflower, and open by pores at the apex (Fig. 560). ~_S. tuberosum_\r\n(the Potato-plant); the Potato-tuber is a swollen, underground\r\nstem; the “eyes” are buds, situated in the axils of its scale-like,\r\nquickly-perishing leaves.~--_Lycopersicum_ resembles _Solanum_ in\r\nthe flower, but the united anthers open by longitudinal clefts and\r\nhave an apical appendage. The cultivated species, _L. esculentum_\r\n(Tomato), has often a higher number than 5 in the flower, and in the\r\nfruit several loculi of unequal size.--_Physalis_ (Winter Cherry);\r\nthe calyx ultimately swells out in the form of a bladder, becomes\r\ncoloured, and loosely envelopes the spherical berry.--_Capsicum_\r\n(Guinea Pepper-plant); some species have very large, irregular,\r\nrather dry (red, yellow, black) berries, which are unilocular\r\nin the upper part.--_Lycium_ (false Tea-plant); the corolla is\r\nsalver- or funnel-shaped; shrubs; often thorny.--_Atropa_ (_A.\r\nbelladonna_, Deadly Nightshade, Fig. 555); corolla campanulate;\r\nthe calyx projects beneath the spherical, black berry. The flowers\r\nare borne singly.--_Mandragora_; (Mandrake); _Nicandra_ (ovary\r\noften 5-locular).--~A small tropical group: CESTREÆ (_Cestrum_,\r\n_Habrothamnus_, etc.) has an almost _straight_ embryo, which may\r\nalso be found _e.g_. in species of _Nicotiana_. Related to the\r\nScrophulariaceæ.~\r\n\r\n   About 1,500 species; the majority within the Tropics, outside\r\n   these limits especially in America. _Solanum nigrum_ is a common\r\n   weed.--_The Potato-plant_ (_Solanum tuberosum_), from Peru\r\n   and Chili, was introduced into Europe in 1584 by Sir Walter\r\n   Raleigh. (Potatoes = Batatos). The fruits of several serve as\r\n   _condiments_: Chilies or Pod-pepper (_Capsicum annuum_ and\r\n   _longum_), and the Cayenne-pepper (_C. baccatum_ and others),\r\n   whose fruits also are officinal, were brought to Europe from S.\r\n   America by Columbus, and are commonly cultivated in Tropical\r\n   America; _Lycopersicum esculentum_ (Tomato) and others from\r\n   Peru; _Solanum ovigerum_ (Egg-plant); _Solanum melongena_,\r\n   etc. _Poisonous_, _acrid_, _narcotic_ properties (alkaloids,\r\n   etc., solanine, nicotine, atropine, hyoscyamine) are found in\r\n   many: _Atropa belladonna_ (from S. Europe; the roots and leaves\r\n   are officinal); _Solanum dulcamara_ (Bitter-sweet; formerly\r\n   officinal), _S. toxicarium_ (Guiana); _Datura stramonium_ from\r\n   Asia (leaves and seeds officinal), _D. sanguinea_, _metel_,\r\n   _tatula_, and others; _Hyoscyamus_ (officinal: the leaves\r\n   and seeds of _H. niger_); _Nicotiana tabacum_ (Virginian\r\n   tobacco, officinal: the leaves), _N. rustica_ and others from\r\n   Trop. America (_Tobacco_ was introduced into Europe in 1560);\r\n   _Cestrum_-species. _Duboisia myoporoides_ (Australia); the\r\n   leaves contain _hyoscyamine_ and are used in medicine. A number\r\n   of species of these genera are ornamental plants.\r\n\r\n   Order 2. =Nolanaceæ.= These most resemble the Convolvulaceæ\r\n   in the corolla, but the Solanaceæ in their branching, and\r\n   leaf-arrangement (in pairs, etc.). The diagram is the same as\r\n   in _Nicandra_ with 5 carpels, but the fruits of this order\r\n   most frequently form, by invaginations in various directions,\r\n   an ovary (with 1 style) consisting of numerous and irregularly\r\n   grouped, 1-ovuled cells; the fruit is a schizocarp with many\r\n   1-seeded fruitlets.--_Nolana_ (Western S. America): a few are\r\n   ornamental plants.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Scrophulariaceæ.= The flower is hypogynous, ☿, _zygomorphic_,\r\nwith the usual type: S5, P5, A5, and G2, the latter placed _in the\r\nmedian plane_; some genera have all 5 stamens developed (Fig. 562\r\n_A_), but most frequently the posterior one is suppressed and the\r\nflower becomes _didynamous_ (Fig. 562 _B_). The fruit, as in the\r\ncapsular-fruited Solanaceæ, is a bilocular, 2-valved _capsule_, with\r\na _thick, axile placenta_, and most often septicidal dehiscence\r\n(Fig. 563 _C_). The _numerous seeds_ are not reniform as in many\r\nSolanaceæ, and have a _straight, or only slightly curved embryo_, with\r\nabundant endosperm (Fig. 563 _D_).--The majority are herbs; some are\r\narborescent; the leaves are opposite or scattered, but stipules are\r\nwanting as in the whole family.\r\n\r\n   The Scrophulariaceæ are closely allied to the Solanaceæ, and\r\n   there is, properly speaking, no characteristic feature which\r\n   absolutely separates them. The somewhat irregular corolla, with\r\n   five stamens of unequal length in _Verbascum_, is also found\r\n   in _Hyoscyamus_; curved and straight embryos are found in both\r\n   orders. The activation of the corolla in the Scrophulariaceæ is\r\n   _simple imbricate_, in the Solanaceæ most frequently _folded\r\n   imbricate_ (in _Atropa_ and those allied to it, imbricate\r\n   without folding). The genera (about 164) are distinguished\r\n   according to the form of the corolla, number of stamens,\r\n   inflorescence, arrangement of the leaves, etc. _Verbascum_\r\n   belongs to the most primitive 5-stamened forms, and from it\r\n   proceed a long series down to _Veronica_, with only two stamens\r\n   and most frequently the posterior sepal suppressed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 562.--Diagrams. _A_ _Verbascum_; _B_\r\n  _Linaria_; _C_ _Veronica_.]\r\n\r\n=1.= ANTIRRHINEÆ, SNAPDRAGON GROUP. This has most frequently a\r\ndescending æstivation of the petals (the posterior petals are outside\r\nthe lateral ones, which again enclose the anterior; Fig. 562 _A_, _B_).\r\nThe plants belonging to this group are not parasites.\r\n\r\n=a.= =5-stamened.=--_Verbascum_ (Mullein, Fig. 563 _A_) has a slightly\r\nirregular, rotate corolla; five stamens (frequently covered with woolly\r\nhairs), of which the two anterior ones are the longer and differ\r\noften also in other respects. ~The inflorescences are racemose, often\r\nwith several series of accessory dichasia in the axil of each primary\r\nfloral-leaf. The leaves are scattered and, together with the stems, are\r\noften covered with a grey felt of branched hairs.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 563.--_Verbascum thapsiforme._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 564.--_Antirrhinum majus._ A flower, and the\r\n  upper lip of a flower with the stamens.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 565.--_Scrophularia nodosa._ Protogynous\r\n  flower in various stages: _A_ ♀ stage; _g_ the stigma projecting\r\n  from the throat of the corolla; _B_ the same in longitudinal\r\n  section; _C_ ♂ stage, the stigma is bent down and its former\r\n  position occupied by the stamens; _s_ staminode; _g_ stigma; _d_\r\n  nectary.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 566.--_Digitalis purpurea._]\r\n\r\n=b.= =4-stamened, didynamous= (Fig. 564).--_Scrophularia_ (Fig-wort,\r\nFig. 565) has cymose inflorescences in a panicle; the corolla (Fig.\r\n565) is urceolate, short two-lipped; the posterior stamens are present\r\nas a scale below the upper lip of the corolla (Fig 565 _s_). ~_S.\r\nnodosa_ has a tuberous rhizome.--_Pentstemon_; the posterior stamen is\r\nbarren and very long.~--_Antirrhinum_ (Snapdragon). The corolla (Fig.\r\n564) is personate, _i.e._ bilabiate, but with the under lip arched\r\nto such an extent that it meets the upper lip, closes the corolla\r\nthroat, and entirely conceals the stamens and style; the corolla-tube\r\nis produced into a short pouch at the base on the anterior side. The\r\ncapsule is oblique and opens by 2–3 pores, formed by small, dentate\r\nvalves. In _Linaria_ (Toad-flax) the pouch is produced into a spur.\r\nSometimes there are traces of the posterior stamens. The capsule opens\r\nby large pores (one for each loculus), produced by large, many-partite\r\nvalves. _L. vulgaris_ reproduces by suckers.--_Digitalis_ (Foxglove,\r\nFig. 566) has long racemes with drooping flowers; the posterior sepal\r\nis small (a step towards complete suppression, as in _Veronica_); the\r\ncorolla is obliquely campanulate, and generally nearly 4-lobed, the\r\ntwo posterior petals coalescing.--_Alonsoa_; _Nemesia_; _Chelone_;\r\n_Herpestis_; _Mimulus_; _Torenia_; _Vandellia_; _Limosella_ (_L.\r\naquatica_, Mud-wort, native); _Scoparia_; _Capraria_; _Erinus_ (found\r\non the Roman Camp at Chesters, Northumberland, and supposed to have\r\nbeen introduced from Spain by the Roman soldiers); _Celsia_ (near\r\n_Verbascum_); _Maurandia_; _Lophospermum_; _Rhodochiton_; _Collinsia_;\r\n_Nycterinia_, etc.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 567.-Flower of _Veronica_.]\r\n\r\n=c.= =2-stamened.=--_Gratiola_ (Water-hyssop). 5-partite calyx.\r\nThe upper lip of the corolla is undivided or slightly bifid; the\r\ntwo anterior stamens are either entirely absent or are reduced to\r\nstaminodes (a transition to _Veronica_).--_Veronica_ (Speedwell), most\r\nfrequently 4-partite calyx; 4-lobed, rotate, zygomorphic corolla with\r\n2 perfect stamens and no trace of the others (Figs. 567, 562 _c_);\r\ncapsule with loculicidal dehiscence. _Calceolaria_; the corolla has two\r\nslipper-like lips.\r\n\r\n=2.= RHINANTHEÆ, YELLOW-RATTLE GROUP. Herbs, all of which (with\r\nthe exception of _Lathræa_) are annual _parasites_ with green\r\nfoliage-leaves. They attach themselves by haustoria to the roots of\r\nother plants and draw nourishment from them. The majority turn black\r\nwhen dried. Racemose inflorescences. In many the calyx is 4-partite,\r\nthe posterior sepal being absent, or very small. The corolla is\r\ndistinctly bilabiate (Fig. 568), with _most frequently ascending\r\næstiration_; in the majority it does not become detached at the\r\nbase, but by means of a ring-like cut some distance up the tube; 4\r\ndidynamous stamens; pollen-grains dry, easily falling out; the anthers\r\nare often furnished at the base with bristles or hairs (Fig. 568)\r\nwhich play a part in the pollination, the probosces of the insects,\r\nbeing forcibly pushed against them, agitate the anthers and shake out\r\nthe pollen-grains. Capsule with loculicidal dehiscence.--_Euphrasia_\r\n(Eye-bright), _Melampyrum_ (Cow-wheat), _Rhinanthus_ (Yellow-rattle),\r\n_Odontites_ (Bartsia), _Pedicularis_ (Louse-wort), and _Lathrœa_\r\n(Tooth-wort) all have native species. The last named is pale yellow,\r\nor reddish (without chlorophyll); ~it is a parasite on the roots of\r\nthe Hazel, Beech and other shrubs, having an aerial stem, and an\r\nunderground, perennial rhizome, covered with opposite, scale-like,\r\nmore or less fleshy leaves with a number of internal glandular,\r\nlabyrinthine cavities. The inflorescence is a unilateral raceme. It\r\napproaches _Gesneriaceæ_ in having a _unilocular_ ovary with two\r\nparietal placentæ.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 568.--_Euphrasia officinalis._ Flower of\r\n  the large and the small-flowered forms; showing the anthers and\r\n  stigmas.]\r\n\r\n   The mechanical contrivances for POLLINATION are so numerous\r\n   that no general principle can be laid down. Personate flowers,\r\n   like those of _Antirrhinum_ are only accessible to strong\r\n   insects, such as humble-bees, which can force themselves\r\n   between the two lips, and so become dusted with pollen on\r\n   the back. In _Euphrasia_ and other _Rhinantheæ_ the insects\r\n   become covered with smooth, powdery pollen when they shake\r\n   the anther-apparatus in touching the hairs and bristles\r\n   mentioned above. _Scrophularia nodosa_ is protogynous (Fig.\r\n   565). _Digitalis purpurea_, however, is protandrous. _Mimulus\r\n   luteus_ and some others have sensitive stigmatic lobes, which\r\n   shut up on being touched. The _Veronica_-species constitute\r\n   a series, from large-flowered down to small-flowered forms,\r\n   and parallel with them are found various gradations from\r\n   insect-to self-pollination. In some (as _Euphrasia officinalis_,\r\n   _Rhinanthus crista galli_) there are two kinds of flowers:\r\n   large, which are pollinated by insects, and small, which are\r\n   self-pollinated (Fig. 568). _Lathræa squamaria_ (Tooth-wort)\r\n   is a protogynous spring-flowering plant, largely visited by\r\n   humble-bees. Others have cleistogamic flowers. _Nycterinia\r\n   capensis_ opens its flowers at night.\r\n\r\n   2,000 species; chiefly from the Temp. OFFICINAL: _Digitalis\r\n   purpurea_ (the leaves; Europe), a poisonous plant. _Verbascum\r\n   thapsus_ and _thapsiforme_, _Veronica officinalis_ (“Herba V.”),\r\n   _Gratiola officinalis_ (“Herba”) have medicinal uses. The whole\r\n   of the Scrophulariaceæ are more or less suspicious, if not\r\n   actually poisonous, and none serve as food. Many are ORNAMENTAL\r\n   PLANTS: _Mimulus luteus_ (N. America), _Paulownia imperialis_\r\n   (the only species; in Japan; a tree), _Antirrhinum vulgare_ (S.\r\n   Eur.), _Linaria_, _Pentstemon_, _Veronica_, _Calceolaria_ (Peru,\r\n   Chili, etc.).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 569.--Leaf of _Utricularia vulgaris_, with\r\n  bladder.

At a a hair of the upper-lip, at _i_ 2 bristles\r\n  of the under-lip of the entrance (_a_, _b_); in the latter are\r\n  placed 4 bristles _h_; _k_ stalk of the bladder, in which is seen\r\n  a vascular bundle. (After Cohn.)]\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Utriculariaceæ.= To this order belong only perennial,\r\n_insectivorous_, _aquatic_, and _marsh-plants_ (200 species) with\r\na more or less characteristic appearance. They differ from the\r\nScrophulariaceæ, especially in having =2= stamens (the anterior) and\r\na _unilocular ovary_, with _free, central placenta_ (like that of the\r\nPrimulaceæ). For the rest the flower is distinctly bilabiate, both in\r\nthe calyx and corolla. Two-valved capsule; no endosperm.\r\n\r\n_Pinguicula_ (Butter-wort) has a rosette of leaves close to the ground;\r\nthese are sticky, covered with glandular hairs, and roll round any\r\nsmall insects which may be caught upon them; flowers solitary, terminal\r\non a long scape; calyx, 5-partite; corolla with spur. The embryo\r\ngerminates with 1 cotyledon.--_Utricularia_ (Bladder-wort). Our native\r\nspecies are floating, _without roots_, with hair-like, divided leaves,\r\nstudded with peculiar bladders (in the Tropics there are terrestrial\r\nspecies, with ordinary foliage). The bladders (Fig. 569) have an\r\naperture, closed by a valve opening inwards, so that small aquatic\r\nanimals are allowed to enter, but are not able to escape; they are\r\nthus entrapped in the bladders, and are probably used as food. Calyx\r\nbipartite; corolla personate with spur.\r\n\r\n   The _embryo_ of _Utricularia_ is very imperfect, scarcely\r\n   more than a spherical, cellular mass, with a few slight\r\n   leaf-rudiments. On the germination of _U. vulgaris_, several\r\n   bristle-like leaves develop into a compact rosette; the stem\r\n   then develops, and also the finely-divided, bladder-bearing\r\n   leaves. A primary root is not developed. The stems branch\r\n   copiously and in a very peculiar manner. The growing-point of\r\n   the stem is rolled spirally.--The stigmatic lobes are sensitive\r\n   and close on being touched; self-pollination often takes place,\r\n   however, in _Pinguicula_.\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Gesneriaceæ.= The flower in this order may be both\r\n   _epigynous_ (_Gesnerieæ_) and _hypogynous_ (_Cyrtandreæ_),\r\n   but otherwise is nearly the same as in Scrophulariaceæ,\r\n   only that _the ovary is unilocular_, with 2 _parietal_,\r\n   often bifid, _placentæ_. Of the 5 stamens the posterior is\r\n   rudimentary, or (more rarely) entirely wanting, and the others\r\n   are didynamous (Cyrtandreæ have often only 2 stamens); their\r\n   anthers are generally glued into a quadrangular mass. The\r\n   majority are herbs with juicy stems, opposite, verticillate\r\n   or scattered leaves without stipules, often, like the stems,\r\n   thick and juicy, soft-haired or glabrous. The corollas are\r\n   often highly-coloured (scarlet, red-yellow, etc., and spotted\r\n   internally), large and magnificent, so that many species are\r\n   ornamental plants. GESNERIEÆ (often epigynous) have endosperm;\r\n   S. Am.--CYRTANDREÆ, hypogynous, without endosperm; Asia, S.\r\n   Africa.--_Streptocarpus_, neither the primary root nor primary\r\n   shoot attains development; one of the cotyledons dies, while the\r\n   other grows and becomes a very large foliage-leaf, from which\r\n   spring adventitious roots and adventitious inflorescences.\r\n\r\n   500 species. _Gloxinia_, _Achimenes_, _Gesneria_, _Alloplectus_,\r\n   _Tydæa_, _Columnea_, _Nægelia_, _Æschynanthus_, and others,\r\n   especially in the forests of tropical America. Some are\r\n   epiphytes on trees, others prefer the leaf-mould of the\r\n   forest and crevices of cliffs. Several genera have peculiar,\r\n   catkin-like, underground shoots, with scale-like compact leaves;\r\n   others have tubers.\r\n\r\n   _Orobanche_ (Broom-rape) is allied to this order as a\r\n   _parasitic_ form. It is a parasite on the roots of other\r\n   plants, not like _Lathræa_ by means of thin rootbranches with\r\n   haustoria, but growing with the base of its stem in close\r\n   contact with its host, and probably even often protruding a kind\r\n   of thallus into it, in a manner similar to the Loranthaceæ. Its\r\n   aerial shoots are not entirely destitute of chlorophyll, but\r\n   are not green; they only bear scale-leaves and terminate in a\r\n   raceme or spike-like inflorescence.--Some _Orobanche_-species\r\n   are detrimental to various cultivated plants (Hemp, Lucerne,\r\n   Tobacco, etc.). The flowers are strongly zygomorphic; the\r\n   posterior sepal is often wanting, and the anterior are united\r\n   to the two lateral ones. Ovary unilocular, as in Gesneraceæ,\r\n   with 2 or 4 parietal placentæ.--The exceedingly small seeds have\r\n   a very rudimentary embryo, formed of an ellipsoidal, cellular\r\n   mass, without indication of cotyledons or other organs.--About\r\n   100 species; especially in the Mediterranean region.\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Bignoniaceæ.= 500 species; nearly all trees and\r\n   shrubs, and to a great extent lianes, climbing by tendrils\r\n   (modified leaves), which are sometimes terminated by a\r\n   special clasping apparatus. These lianes have, as a rule, an\r\n   _anomalous stem structure_, the wood being either divided\r\n   into four wedges at right angles to each other, separated\r\n   by four grooves filled with secondary wood-parenchyma, or a\r\n   greater number of wedges occur, by the cambium ceasing to\r\n   form wood in several places. The leaves are most frequently\r\n   opposite and compound; the flowers in the main are similar\r\n   to the didynamous Scrophulariaceæ, and especially resemble\r\n   those of _Digitalis purpurea_; they are bilabiate, large,\r\n   and beautiful, campanulate or trumpet-shaped, many of the\r\n   prettiest ornamental plants in the Tropics belonging to this\r\n   order. The fruit is most frequently a large, woody, 2-valved,\r\n   siliqua-like, septifragal capsule, whose valves separate from\r\n   the flat and broad partition-wall, which bears the large,\r\n   generally winged seeds: _Tecoma_; _Bignonia_.--In gardens:\r\n   _Catalpa syringæfolia_ (Trumpet-wood); _Tecoma radicans_\r\n   (from S. Am.).--“Palisander”-wood is from _Jacaranda_ (S.\r\n   Am.).--_Eccremocarpus_ (N. Am.) forms, by its unilocular\r\n   capsule, a transition to the Gesneriaceæ (_E. scaber_;\r\n   herbaceous).\r\n\r\n   _Crescentia_ is allied to this order; _C. cujete_ (Calabash) is\r\n   its best known species. The fruit (unilocular with 2 parietal\r\n   placentæ) is a very large, spherical or ellipsoidal berry, with\r\n   a firm, finally woody outer layer. After the removal of the\r\n   juicy interior, these are commonly used as drinking vessels in\r\n   Tropical America.\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Pedaliaceæ.= _Sesamum_ (_orientale_ and _indicum_);\r\n   very important oil-plants, which from olden times have been\r\n   cultivated in tropical Asia and Africa for food and as medicinal\r\n   plants, and are now cultivated in America also. The seeds are\r\n   used as a raw material in the manufacture of soap in Europe.--To\r\n   this order also belong _Martynia_ and _Craniolaria_, which have\r\n   a long horned capsule and sensitive stigmas.--46 species.\r\n\r\n   Order 8. =Acanthaceæ.= 1,500 species; mostly erect, slender,\r\n   branched herbs or shrubs, rarely arborescent, especially in\r\n   S. Am. and Ind. The branches frequently have swollen nodes;\r\n   the leaves are _opposite_, penninerved, undivided, more or\r\n   less lanceolate or elliptical, and generally leave a distinct\r\n   scar when they fall off. Stipules are wanting. The flowers are\r\n   solitary or in dichasia, which are arranged in 4-rowed spikes\r\n   or racemes, each flower with its subtending bract, which may be\r\n   brightly coloured, and most frequently also with two bracteoles.\r\n   With regard to the corolla (which is often labiate, in any\r\n   case irregular, and frequently prettily coloured), the 2 or\r\n   4 didynamous stamens (of whose anthers one half is inserted\r\n   lower than the other, or suppressed) and the gynœceum, the\r\n   Acanthaceæ are true Personatæ, approaching most nearly to the\r\n   Scrophulariaceæ: they differ from the other orders especially in\r\n   the _fruit_, which is a bilocular, 2-valved, often elastically\r\n   dehiscing capsule, which never has more than 2 rows, and in some\r\n   only 2 seeds in each loculus, the seeds being often compressed\r\n   and borne on _strong_, _curved_ or _hook-like funicles_\r\n   (_retinacula_) which persist after dehiscence. _Embryo curved\r\n   without endosperm_; radicle pointed downwards.--Cleistogamic\r\n   flowers are found in several species. Cystoliths are common.\r\n\r\n   The following grow wild in Europe: _Acanthus_ (_spinosus_\r\n   and _mollis_, whose pinnatifid leaves served as models for\r\n   the capitals of the Corinthian columns). The posterior sepal\r\n   is the largest of all the leaves of the flower, and covers\r\n   the other parts like a helmet; the 2 anterior sepals are\r\n   united, and the two lateral ones are small and greenish; the\r\n   corolla has no upper-lip, but only a 3-lobed under-lip. The\r\n   anthers are bilocular; the filaments ultimately become very\r\n   firm.--_Justicia_, _Eranthemum_, _Goldfussia_, _Thunbergia_ (a\r\n   twiner), _Ruellia_, _Dicliptera_, etc.--Ornamental plants in\r\n   conservatories.\r\n\r\nOrder 9. =Plantaginaceæ= (=Plantains=). The flowers (Figs. 570, 571)\r\nare regular, ☿, hypogynous, with a =4=-partite, persistent calyx,\r\na gamopetalous, _scarious_ corolla with =4= projecting lobes, =4=\r\nstamens, incurved in the bud, later on projecting considerably, about\r\nequal in length, and a bilocular ovary with _one_ long, filamentous,\r\n_undivided_, _feathery_, papillose style (see Fig. 571). The ovary\r\nis most frequently bilocular with 1–few ovules in each loculus. An\r\nhypogynous disc is wanting. The fruit is a _pyxidium_ with 1–few\r\npeltate seeds attached in each loculus (_Littorella_ is in several\r\nrespects an exception). All species are herbs, the majority with\r\nleaf-rosettes near the ground, and the flowers in spikes or capitula.\r\n\r\n   The labiate-like flowers are in this case entirely concealed\r\n   under a regular, apparently 4-merous exterior. The structure of\r\n   the flower, however, is the same as in the _Scrophulariaceæ_,\r\n   only the reduction, which is found in _Veronica_ (compare Figs.\r\n   562 _C_, 567 with 570, 571), is also present in this instance\r\n   and the lobes are also more equally developed; the posterior\r\n   petal corresponds to the bilobed upper-lip; the posterior stamen\r\n   and the posterior sepal also are entirely wanting. In the\r\n   development of the flower there is no trace of posterior sepal\r\n   or stamen, and the posterior petal arises from one primordium,\r\n   but the two anterior sepals arise before the lateral ones. The\r\n   position of sepals and petals does not agree with that of a\r\n   true 4-merous flower, which is represented in Fig. 361 _E._ The\r\n   bracteoles are always suppressed in _Plantago_.\r\n\r\n_Plantago_ (Plantain, Rib-grass). The foliage-leaves are most\r\nfrequently scattered, entire, with curved veins, arranged in a\r\nrosette close to the ground on an unlimited rhizome; the spike-like\r\ninflorescence is borne on a long scape; in some (_P. psyllium_) the\r\nleaves are opposite on a stem with well-developed internodes, and\r\nthe inflorescences are borne in their axils. The order also presents\r\na transition from insect-pollinated to wind-pollinated flowers.\r\n~The flowers are protogynous, wind-pollinated in _P. major_ and _P.\r\nlanceolata_, partly also in the other species, but insect pollination\r\nalso occurs, and _P. media_ has three kinds of flowers, some of which\r\nare adapted for wind-pollination (Fig. 571), others, with short\r\nfilaments, for insects.~ _Littorella lacustris_ (Shore-weed) is the\r\nmost reduced of the Plantaginaceæ: an aquatic plant with rosettes\r\nof round, awl-like leaves and diclinous (monœcious) flowers. ~In the\r\naxils of the foliage-leaves is a very short 3-flowered spike, formed by\r\n2 sessile ♀-flowers, and above them a long-stalked ♂-flower; all the\r\nflowers are lateral, the terminal one being absent, as in _Plantago_.\r\nThe ♂-flower is essentially the same as in _Plantago_, but the ♀-flower\r\nhas a scarious corolla, with a narrow, 3–4-dentate mouth, which closes\r\ntightly round the nut-like fruit.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 570, 571.--_Plantago media._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 570.--Diagram of _Plantago media_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 571.--Two different forms of the flower (magnified):\r\n  1, chiefly adapted for pollination by wind; 2, for\r\n  insect-pollination. _a_ The stigma; _b_ the calyx; _k_ the\r\n  corolla.]\r\n\r\n   The genus _Plantago_ constitutes nearly the entire\r\n   order (200 species). Some are widely distributed weeds\r\n   (_e.g._ _P. major_, “The white man’s footstep”). In\r\n   _P. psyllium_ (S. Eur.) the integument of the seeds is\r\n   mucilaginous, and swells considerably in water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 31. =Nuculiferæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers are _hypogynous_ and _zygomorphic_ (in _Boraginaceæ_ and\r\n_Cordiaceæ_, however, they are regular, except _Echium_ and _Anchusa\r\narvensis_). The calyx is gamosepalous, the corolla _bilabiate_ (except\r\nin the two orders mentioned), mostly after 2/3, _i.e._ divided into\r\na 2-leaved posterior portion, and a 3-leaved anterior portion.\r\nThe æstivation of the corolla is nearly always descending.--In\r\n_Boraginaceæ_ and _Cordiaceæ_ there are 5 stamens of equal length; in\r\nthe other orders 4 didynamous ones, or only 2 fertile; the posterior\r\nstamen is sometimes developed as a staminode, sometimes fertile (in\r\n_Stilbaceæ_). The ovary is formed of 2 median carpels (except some\r\n_Verbenaceæ_), with (1-) =2= ovules on each carpel; in the majority of\r\nthe orders it is, however, divided by a false partition-wall between\r\nthe dorsal and ventral sutures, into =4= _loculi_, each of which is\r\noften raised independently, causing the style to be situated in the\r\ndepression between the four lobes (“gynobasic” style, Figs. 572,\r\n573, 575, 579). The fruit in these orders most frequently becomes a\r\n_4-partite schizocarp_ with _nut-like fruitlets_. The other orders have\r\na 1(-2)-locular ovary.--The leaves are _simple, without stipules_.\r\n\r\n   The family is related to (and proceeds from) the _Tubifloræ_,\r\n   especially _Convolvulaceæ_, which has an almost similar\r\n   construction of the ovary. It is doubtful whether the\r\n   _Cordiaceæ_ and _Boraginaceæ_ should be classed with the others.\r\n\r\n   The orders are: 1, Cordiaceæ; 2. Boraginaceæ; 3, Verbenaceæ; 4,\r\n   Labiatæ; 5, Selaginaceæ; 6. Globulariaceæ; 7, Stilbaceæ.\r\n\r\n   Order 1. =Cordiaceæ= unites Convolvulaceæ and Boraginaceæ.\r\n   Tree-like plants with 5-(4–10) merous flowers, doubly bifid\r\n   style, and drupe with 4 or less loculi. No endosperm; cotyledons\r\n   folded.--185 species; tropical.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Boraginaceæ.= The vegetative parts are very characteristic:\r\n_herbs_ with _cylindrical_ stems and _scattered_, undivided, nearly\r\nalways sessile, entire leaves, without stipules, and generally,\r\ntogether with the other green portions of the plant, covered with\r\nstiff hairs, consequently rough and often even stinging (hence\r\nthe other name for the order _Asperifoliæ_). The inflorescences\r\nare _unipared scorpioid cymes_ with the branches coiled spirally\r\n(“helicoid,” Fig. 573) before the flowers open. The flower is perfect,\r\n_regular_ (obliquely zygomorphic in _Echium_ and _Anchusa arvensis_),\r\nhypogynous, gamopetalous: S5, P5 (often with ligular outgrowths),\r\nA5, G2, but each of the two loculi of the ovary becomes divided by a\r\nfalse partition-wall into two, each of which contains one _pendulous_\r\nanatropous ovule with the micropyle turned upwards; the four loculi\r\narch upwards, so that the ovary becomes 4-lobed, and the style is\r\nthen, as in the _Borageæ_, placed _at the base_ (“gynobasic”) between\r\nthe four projections (Figs. 572, 573). The fruit is a _4-partite\r\nschizocarp_ with four nut-like fruitlets (Fig. 572).--_Endosperm is\r\nwanting_ (except in _Heliotropium_); the radicle is turned _upwards_.\r\n\r\n   The INFLORESCENCES are often double unipared scorpioid cymes;\r\n   the bud of the second bracteole is developed, that of the first\r\n   suppressed; in some cases both the bracteoles are suppressed\r\n   (_Myosotis_, _Omphalodes_, etc.), but in other instances all\r\n   the first bracteoles (_a_) only are suppressed, and the others\r\n   are then situated in two rows towards the under side of the\r\n   coiled axis, while the flowers are situated on the upper side.\r\n   Displacement of the branches or of the floral-leaves sometimes\r\n   takes place. The flowers are often red at first, and later on\r\n   become blue or violet; they hardly ever have any smell. The\r\n   fruit entirely resembles that of the Labiatæ, but the radicle\r\n   of the latter is turned downwards. The fruitlets present small\r\n   differences which have systematic importance; they are hollow or\r\n   flat at the base, attached to a flat or columnar receptacle, etc.\r\n\r\n=1.= HELIOTROPIEÆ. This group deviates from the characteristics\r\nmentioned above in the undivided ovary and terminal (“apical”) style.\r\nIn this, as well as in the fact that in some genera (_Tournefortia_,\r\n_Ehretia_, etc.) the fruit is a drupe, it connects this order with the\r\nCordiaceæ. _Heliotropium_, _Tiaridium_, and others have schizocarps.\r\n\r\n=2.= BORAGEÆ, BORAGE GROUP. Style gynobasic; fruit a schizocarp.\r\n\r\n=A.= The throat of the corolla is without ligules, or with very small\r\nones.--_Pulmonaria_ (Lung-wort); funnel-shaped corolla; a whorl\r\nof hairs in the corolla-throat.--_Echium_ (Viper’s-bugloss) has\r\nzygomorphic flowers, the plane of symmetry almost coinciding with that\r\nof the very well-developed inflorescence (through the fourth sepal);\r\nthe corolla is obliquely funnel-shaped, the style is more deeply cleft\r\nat the apex than in the others; stamens 2 longer, 2 shorter, and 1\r\nstill shorter.--_Cerinthe_ has a tubular corolla with five small\r\nteeth and two bilocular fruitlets. The bracts are large and leafy,\r\nand, like all the rest of the plant, are _almost glabrous_.--A few\r\n_Lithospermum_-species have a naked corolla-throat; others have small\r\nhairy ligules, which do not close the corolla-throat. The fruitlets\r\nare as hard as stone, owing to the presence of carbonate of lime and\r\nsilica.--_Mertensia_ (_Steenhammera_); _Arnebia_; _Nonnea_ (small\r\nligules).\r\n\r\n=B.= The corolla-throat is closed by, or in any case provided with\r\n_ligules_, _i.e._ scale-like bodies or small protuberances, situated\r\nin the throat of the corolla _opposite_ the petals, and which are\r\ninvaginations or _internal_ spurs of the petals (Fig. 572 _D_).--The\r\nnuts in _Cynoglossum_ (Hound’s-tongue) bear _hooked bristles_ over the\r\nentire surface, or, in _Echinospermum_, only on the edge. The following\r\nhave smooth nuts:--_Symphytum_ (Comfrey) has a cylindrical, campanulate\r\ncorolla, and prolonged-triangular, pointed ligules.--_Borago_\r\n(Borage) has a rotate corolla with projecting, emarginate ligules;\r\nthe stamens have a horn-like appendage, projecting upwards from the\r\nback of the filament. The fruitlets are hollow below.--_Anchusa_\r\n(Alkanet, Fig. 572). The corolla is salver-shaped; the ligules\r\nsmall, hairy protuberances. _A. (Lycopsis) arvensis_ has an S-curved\r\ncorolla-tube.--_Myosotis_ (Forget-me-not, Fig. 573); rotate corolla\r\nwith small (yellow) protuberances in the throat; scorpioid cyme without\r\nfloral-leaves; fruitlets flat.--_Omphalodes_; fruitlets hollow at the\r\nback, with a scarious, turned-in, toothed edge.--_Asperugo_ (Mad-wort);\r\nthe calyx grows after flowering, becoming large, compressed, and\r\ndeeply bifid.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 572.--_Anchusa officinalis_: _A_ diagram;\r\n  the brocteole _a_ is suppressed (dotted); β supports a flower.\r\n  _B_, _C_ _Myosotis_, the fruit, entire and with the calyx in\r\n  longitudinal section. _D_, _F_ _Alkanna tinctoria_: D the corolla\r\n  opened (4/1); _e_ the ligule; _f_, _g_ the anthers; _E_ gyncœceum\r\n  (3/1); _F_ fruit, with three fruitlets; _i_ an aborted loculus;\r\n  _h_ disc.]\r\n\r\n   CROSS-POLLINATION is most commonly effected by insects\r\n   (especially bees). There are a great many contrivances for\r\n   pollination; some flowers are protandrous (_Echium vulgare_,\r\n   _Borago officin._), others are heterostylous (long-and\r\n   short-styled: _Pulmonaria officin._); the corona (ligules) is\r\n   a protection against rain, and excludes certain insects. Some\r\n   are barren when self-pollinated (_Pulmonaria officinalis_,\r\n   _Echium vulgare_); others which have but little honey, may,\r\n   failing insect-pollination, fertilise themselves, and in\r\n   _Myosotis versicolor_ this regularly occurs by the growth of the\r\n   corolla during flowering, so that the anthers are brought into\r\n   contact with the stigma. Honey is secreted on the hypogynous\r\n   disc.--About 1,150 species, growing especially in the northern\r\n   temperate zone, _Mucilage_ is found (_e.g._ in the _officinal_\r\n   root of _Cynoglossum officinale_, in the root of _Symphytum_):\r\n   red _dyes_ are found in some roots (_e.g._ Alkanet-root, the\r\n   root of _Alkanna tinctoria_, which is also medicinal; S. E.\r\n   Europe, Asia Minor); some are _poisonous_: _Cynoglossum_,\r\n   _Echium_, _Anchusa_, etc. Several species are ornamental plants.\r\n   _Heliotropium_ (Peru) is cultivated chiefly on account of its\r\n   pleasant scent; essential oils are otherwise very rare.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 573.-_Myosotis._ Inflorescence and gynœceum.]\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Verbenaceæ.= The majority are shrubs; a few are herbs or\r\ntrees (Teak-tree); some are lianes. The branches are often square.\r\nThe leaves are opposite or verticillate, without stipules; in some\r\ncompound. The inflorescences are racemes, spikes, capitula, or\r\ndichasia. Five sepals; five petals in a gamopetalous, zygomorphic\r\ncorolla, which is often bilabiate, but rarely to such an extent as in\r\nthe Labiatæ, and the upper lip in some is larger than the under, in\r\nothers smaller; stamens four didynamous, or two; the ovary is entire\r\n(not grooved or divided), 1- or 2-locular, or, as in the Labiatæ,\r\ndivided into four loculi with an _erect_ ovule in each, but in some\r\nthe anterior carpel is suppressed. One _terminal_ style. The fruit is,\r\n_e.g._ in _Verbena_, a 4 partite schizocarp with nut-like fruitlets;\r\nin _Vitex_ (digitate leaves) a drupe with a 4-locular stone; in\r\n_Clerodendron_ a similar fruit, with four free stones; in _Lantana_\r\na bilocular stone, or two unilocular stones. The radicle is _turned\r\ndownwards_. Endosperm small or absent.--_Lippia_, _Stachytarpheta_,\r\n_Bouchea_, _Priva_, _Citharexylon_, _Callicarpa_, etc.--The Verbenaceæ\r\nare closely allied to the Labiatæ; they differ especially in the ovary\r\nnot being 4-lobed with gynobasic style, but undivided, almost spherical\r\nor ovoid with a terminal style. Again, the leaves are not so constantly\r\nopposite, and the inflorescences are various.\r\n\r\n   730 species; especially in the Tropics; there are several in\r\n   America, especially _Lantana-species_; shrubby weeds.--Many of\r\n   those mentioned are ORNAMENTAL PLANTS, especially _Verbena_;\r\n   _Vitex agnus castus_ is a S. European shrub. _Lippia citriodora_\r\n   (S. Am.) etc., have strongly-scented leaves; the Teak tree\r\n   (_Tectona grandis_) is one of the largest trees in East India,\r\n   and has a very hard wood.\r\n\r\n   _Avicennia_ is allied to this order; it inhabits the Mangrove\r\n   swamps on tropical coasts. The endosperm emerges from the ovule,\r\n   carrying the embryo with it; the embryo ultimately bursts the\r\n   endosperm and lies free in the loculus of the fruit; this is\r\n   then filled by the embryo with its large, green cotyledons,\r\n   which are borne on an already hairy or rooted stem. The seedling\r\n   thus developed falls from the tree, together with the fruit, and\r\n   strikes root in the mud. One special cell of the endosperm at\r\n   an earlier period becomes a highly-developed organ of suction,\r\n   growing into a much-branched sac, very rich in protoplasm.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. =Labiatæ.= The special characteristics are: the _square_ stem,\r\nthe _opposite leaves_ (without stipules), the inflorescences which are\r\nformed by _two double unipared scorpioid cymes_, the _labiate_ corolla,\r\nthe 4 _didynamous_ stamens (the posterior being entirely suppressed)\r\n(Fig. 574), and the _4-partite schizocarp_ with _nut-like fruitlets_.\r\nThe floral formula is S5, P5, A5 (the posterior stamen is generally\r\nabsent), G2.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 574.--Diagram of _Lamium album_: _sv_\r\n  dichasia.]\r\n\r\nThey are chiefly aromatic plants (herbs, shrubs, _e.g._ Lavender,\r\nor trees), volatile oil being formed in internal cells or in the\r\nglandular hairs, which cover all green parts. The stem is always more\r\nor less markedly square; the leaves are borne upon the flat sides,\r\nand are simple and penninerved, but vary in the other characters.\r\nThe inflorescences are double unipared scorpioid cymes, which may\r\nbe situated at some distance from one another in the axils of the\r\nfoliage-leaves (Fig. 575 _A_), but frequently when the subtending\r\nleaves are bract-like, they are crowded into spike-like inflorescences\r\n(_Lavandula_, _Mentha_, _Salvia_, etc.), each of the so-called “whorls”\r\n(verticillaster, glomerulus) being a double unipared scorpioid cyme\r\n(Fig. 574). (Solitary flowers are found in _e.g._ _Scutellaria_, and\r\n_Origanum_). The calyx is strongly gamosepalous, 5-toothed, often\r\nbilabiate (Fig. 575 _B_). The corolla is strongly bilabiate (Figs. 575,\r\n576, etc.), with 2 lobes in the upper lip and 3 lobes in the under lip\r\n(an approach to regularity occurs only when the upper lip is small,\r\nand thus resembles one lobe, as in _Mentha_ (Fig. 578) and _Lycopus_,\r\nso that the corolla approaches the 4-merous corolla of _Veronica_\r\nand _Plantago_). The posterior stamen in the diagram (Fig. 574*)\r\nis entirely suppressed; in most of the genera the posterior lateral\r\nstamens are the smaller (Fig. 575 _D_), and are entirely suppressed in\r\nsome (see below); in others, _e.g._ _Nepeta_, they are the longer. 2\r\nstamens are found in _Salvia_, _Rosmarinus_, _Lycopus_, etc. The two\r\nhalves of the anthers are often separated from one another, and are\r\nplaced at an angle with each other. The gynœceum has 1 style with a\r\nbifid extremity (Fig. 575 _C_) bearing the stigma; the true bilocular\r\novary is divided by a false partition-wall into 4 loculi, each with 1\r\nerect ovule (Fig. 575 _H_). These 4 loculi project so strongly that the\r\novary becomes deeply 4-lobed with the style situated in the centre of\r\nthe lobes and at their base, “gynobasic” (Figs. 575, 579). A ring-like,\r\noften crenate, nectary surrounds the base of the ovary (Fig. 575 _G_,\r\n_H_). The embryo in this order, as in the _Verbenaceæ_, is directed\r\ndownwards (Fig. 575 _J_) (it is directed upwards in the _Boraginaceæ_,\r\nwhich have an entirely similar fruit). _Endosperm absent._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 575.--_Thymus vulgaris._]\r\n\r\n   The 142 genera are mainly distinguished according to the form of\r\n   the calyx and corolla, the number, direction, and length of the\r\n   stamens, the forms of the nuts, etc.\r\n\r\n=1.= AJUGEÆ, BUGLE GROUP. Calyx 10-nerved; the upper lip is small; 4\r\nstamens. The ovary is not so strongly lobed as in the following group,\r\nso that it is most nearly allied to the _Verbenaceæ_. The nuts are\r\nreticulately wrinkled. _Ajuga_ (Bugle) has a very small upper lip. The\r\nupper lip of _Teucrium_ (Germander) is deeply cleft, and the two lobes\r\nare bent on their respective sides towards the under lip, which in\r\nconsequence appears to be 5-lobed, and the upper lip to be wanting.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 576.--_Lamium album_: _A_ lateral view of\r\n  flower; _B_ longitudinal section; _C_ ovary with nectaries (_a_);\r\n  _D_ the apex of the style; _e_, upper lip of corolla; _c_, _b_,\r\n  _c_ the three petals of the lower lip; _f_ anthers; _g_ stigma.]\r\n\r\n=2.= STACHYDEÆ, BETONY GROUP. The calyx is 5- or 10-nerved. The\r\nupper lip of the corolla is most frequently _strongly arched_ or\r\nhelmet-shaped; 4 stamens, the _anterior pair the longer_ (Fig. 576).\r\n\r\n=a.= A somewhat regular and 5–10-dentate calyx with _projecting_\r\nstamens.--_Stachys_ (Betony, Woundwort); the lobes of the under\r\nlip are rounded off. The anterior filaments, after pollination,\r\n_bend outwards_. _Betonica_--_Ballota_ (Horehound); the calyx\r\nis funnel-shaped, and has triangular, long, pointed, awn-like\r\nteeth.--_Galeopsis_ (Hemp-nettle) has two conical protuberances on the\r\nunder lip between the lateral and the central lobes. The anthers open\r\nby 2 _unequal_ valves. _Lamium_ (Dead-nettle, Fig. 576) has dentate,\r\nlateral lobes on the under lip. _L. album_ (White Dead-nettle), _L.\r\nrubrum_, etc. _Galeobdolon._--_Leonurus_; _Phlomis_.\r\n\r\n=b.= Tubular, regular, often 10-toothed calyx and _concealed_\r\nstamens.--_Marrubium vulgare_ (Fig. 577); 10 calyx-teeth, hooked at\r\nthe apex; many almost spherical whorls of flowers in the axils of the\r\nfoliage-leaves, at some distance from one another.--_Sideritis._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 577.--_Marrubium vulgare._]\r\n\r\n=c.= Strongly bilabiate calyx, the lips _closing together_ after\r\nflowering.--_Scutellaria_ (Skull-cap); the two lips of the calyx are\r\nentire, the upper lip has a large spur, and drops off on the ripening\r\nof the fruit. The flowers are generally solitary and turned to one\r\nside.--_Prunella_ (Heal-all); the calyx is compressed, its two lips are\r\nstrongly dentate, the upper lips closing slightly round the under. The\r\nstamens have a tooth-like projection beneath the anthers.\r\n\r\n=3.= NEPETEÆ, CATMINT GROUP. 13–15 nerves in the calyx; this deviates\r\nfrom the other groups in the _posterior stamens being the longer_.\r\nThe upper lip is slightly arched. _Nepeta_ (Catmint), also _Glechoma_\r\n(Ground Ivy), with regular, and _Dracocephalum_ with irregular calyx.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 578.--_Mentha aquatica_, var. _crispa_.]\r\n\r\n=4.= SATUREIEÆ, MINT GROUP. The upper lip is _flat_, most frequently\r\novate, or almost spherical, and emarginate (Fig. 578). The calyx\r\nis most frequently 5–10-nerved. 4 stamens, _the anterior being the\r\nlonger_; rarely, 2 stamens only.--_Mentha_ (Mint, Fig. 578) has a\r\nregular, 5-dentate calyx, a small, almost regular, 4-partite corolla,\r\nand 4 erect stamens of nearly equal size. The verticillasters are\r\nmany-flowered, and are often collected into cylindrical inflorescences.\r\nHerbs.--_Lycopus_ (Gipsy-wort); corolla almost regular. 2 stamens,\r\nthe posterior lateral ones are wanting. _Preslia_: 4-dentate calyx,\r\n4-partite, regular corolla; 4 stamens of equal size.--_Thymus_ (Thyme,\r\nFig. 575) has a strongly bilabiate calyx, the throat being closed by\r\na whorl of hairs (Fig. 575 B). The corolla is distinctly labiate.\r\nUnder-shrubs, with small entire leaves; verticillasters few-flowered\r\nand separate.--_Origanum_ (Marjoram); spike or capitate inflorescences\r\nwith the flowers solitary in the axils of the rather large and\r\ndistinctly 4-rowed (often slightly coloured) floral-leaves. _Melissa._\r\n_Calamintha._ _Clinopodium_ (Wild Basil). _Satureia._ _Hyssopus_\r\n(Hyssop); small, entire leaves; the verticillasters are situated\r\nunilaterally in a slender, spike-like inflorescence. _Lavandula_\r\n(Lavender); shrubs with verticillasters collected in cylindrical,\r\nlong-stalked inflorescences; the calyx is tubular, has 13–15 nerves,\r\nthe posterior tooth is much larger than the others. Stamens and style\r\ndo _not_ project. ~_Coleus_ differs, among other characters, in having\r\nunited filaments; the stamens and style are bent down and concealed in\r\nthe boat-shaped under lip.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 579.--_Salvia officinalis._]\r\n\r\n=5.= MONARDEÆ, SALVIA GROUP. _Only the 2 anterior stamens are\r\ndeveloped._--_Salvia_ (Fig. 579); calyx deeply bilabiate; the upper\r\nlip of the corolla is generally strongly compressed. Rudiments of\r\nthe two lateral stamens are present. The connective in the two\r\nfertile stamens is long and filamentous, and bears at the upper end\r\na normal half-anther, but at the lower one a barren, often broader\r\nportion, against which the insect is obliged to push its proboscis\r\nduring its visits to the flowers, causing the pollen-bearing\r\nhalf-anther to be pressed down against its back. Floral-leaves often\r\ncoloured.--_Rosmarinus_ (Rosemary); a shrub with leathery linear\r\nleaves, with rolled back edge. A small tooth on the filament represents\r\nthe barren half of the anther. _Monarda._\r\n\r\n   The POLLINATION is generally effected by insects, especially\r\n   bees; the under-lip is the landing-stage and the pollen is\r\n   deposited on their backs. Cross-fertilisation is promoted by\r\n   dichogamy; honey is secreted by an hypogynous disc and collected\r\n   in the corolla-tube. Some genera are homogamous (_Lamium_,\r\n   _Galeopsis_, etc.); others are dichogamous (protandrous); a\r\n   few are _gynodiœcious_: ♀-and ☿-flowers in various relative\r\n   sizes (_Glechoma hederaceum_, _Thymus_, _Salvia pratensis_,\r\n   and others). The entrance of uninvited guests to the honey is\r\n   often rendered difficult by whorls of hairs, etc. In numerous\r\n   instances the upper lip protects the pollen from rain.\r\n   _Cleistogamy_ is found _e.g._ in _Lamium amplexicaule_.\r\n\r\n   2,700 species; distributed over the entire globe, but the\r\n   greater number in Mediterranean countries (especially in the\r\n   Eastern regions), where many are shrub-like.--Poisonous and\r\n   acrid properties are absent. On account of their _volatile oils_\r\n   they are principally used as _condiments_, for _perfumery_\r\n   and in _medicine_ (the officinal parts are therefore nearly\r\n   always “folia” and “herba,” in _Lavandula_ the flowers, and\r\n   the volatile oils extracted from them). Such are:[39]_Mentha\r\n   piperita_ [+] (Peppermint)--menthol is obtained from this\r\n   species and from _M. arvensis_--_M. viridis_ [+] (Spearmint),\r\n   _M. crispa_ (Curly-mint), _Thymus vulgaris_ (Garden Thyme),\r\n   _Melissa officinalis_ (S.

Africa. They\r\n   differ from the other Nuculiferæ especially in the bilocular,\r\n   transversely-placed anthers of the 4 stamens (2 stamens\r\n   divided as far as the base (?)). The ovary has 2, or by\r\n   suppression only 1 loculus, each with 1 ovule, and the fruit\r\n   is a schizocarp dividing into two, or is a 1-seeded nut.\r\n   Radicle turned upwards.--A few are ornamental plants (_Selago_,\r\n   _Hebenstreitia_).\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Globulariaceæ.= 12 species; especially in the\r\n   Mediterranean. They form an analogy to the Compositæ, and in the\r\n   main resemble _Jasione montana_ in appearance, the flowers being\r\n   crowded into a spherical head (hence their name) and supported\r\n   by bracts, but _without_ involucre; the ovary is _unilocular_\r\n   with 1 pendulous ovule. The _1-seeded nut_ is enveloped by the\r\n   persistent calyx. The corolla is more or less labiate, the\r\n   upper-lip is often absent as in the ligulate corollas of the\r\n   Astereæ; stamens 4, didynamous, with transversely placed anthers\r\n   opening by one transverse cleft. The leaves are scattered,\r\n   simple, entire, and generally form a rosette. _Globularia._\r\n\r\n   Order 7. =Stilbaceæ.= Heath-like shrubs. The ovary is bilocular;\r\n   1 erect seed in each loculus, or the posterior cell is empty.\r\n   _Stilbe._ 7 species. S. Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 32. =Contortæ.=\r\n\r\n_Hypogynous_, regular, ☿, gamopetalous flowers (Figs. 581, 582),\r\nwhich are generally 5- or 4-merous, with 5 or 4 stamens (with the\r\nexception of _Oleaceæ_ and _Jasminaceæ_ which have _only_ 2 stamens,\r\nalternating with the carpels). The gynœceum is formed of 2 (nearly\r\nalways median) carpels. The corolla _very frequently has twisted\r\næstivation_ (the upper edges of the petals being free; Fig. 581 _A_),\r\nand hence the individual lobes of the corolla are oblique, but the\r\nflower as a whole is regularly actinomorphic. A nectary, in the form of\r\na honey-secreting ring or glands, is often found round the base of the\r\novary.--The leaves, with a few exceptions, are _opposite_ and _without\r\nstipules_. Endosperm large (Fig. 581 _C_), except in _Jasminaceæ_ and\r\n_Asclepiadaceæ_.\r\n\r\n   The Apocynaceæ and the Asclepiadaceæ, on account of the free\r\n   ovaries, without doubt represent a more primitive form, but the\r\n   Asclepiadaceæ on the other hand form an offshoot on account of\r\n   their peculiar pollen-masses. The Loganiaceæ form a transition\r\n   to the Rubiaceæ.\r\n\r\n   The orders are:--\r\n\r\n   A. STAMENS 5. 1, Gentianaceæ; 2, Apocynaceæ; 3, Asclepiadaceæ;\r\n   4, Loganiaceæ.\r\n\r\n   B. STAMENS 2. 5, Oleaceæ; 6, Jasminaceæ; 7, Salvadoraceæ.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Gentianaceæ= (=Gentians=). _Glabrous_ herbs, without latex;\r\nthe opposite, undivided and _entire_ leaves are often slightly united\r\nat the base; many have rosette-like radical leaves. _Stipules absent_.\r\nThe flowers are generally borne in regular, dichotomously-branched\r\n_dichasia_ (Figs. 580, 581 _A_), which finally become transformed into\r\nunipared scorpioid cymes; the parts of the flower are 4–5-merous as\r\nfar as the gynœceum, which is 2-merous; the calyx frequently is almost\r\npolysepalous; the corolla has distinctly twisted æstivation (the upper\r\nedges being free) (Fig. 581 _A_), except _Menyantheæ_. The carpels are\r\n_entirely_ united, and most frequently form a _1-locular_ ovary with 2\r\n_parietal placentæ_ bearing many ovules (often in several rows, Fig.\r\n581 _D_, _F_). _Capsule_, 2-valved, with septicidal dehiscence, the\r\nincurved edges bearing the seeds (Fig. 581 _D_, _F_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 580.--_Erythræa._ Inflorescence. 1, 2, 3,\r\n  etc., the successive shoot-generations.]\r\n\r\n=1.= GENTIANEÆ.--_Gentiana_ (Gentian) has most frequently a tubular,\r\ncampanulate or funnel-shaped corolla, sometimes with teeth between the\r\ncorolla-lobes and fringed in the throat of the corolla; _G. lutea_ has\r\na rotate, yellow corolla.--~_Swertia_: rotate corolla; each lobe has at\r\nits base 1–2 nectaries, with fringed edges.~\r\n\r\n_Erythræa_ (Centaury, Fig. 581); corolla most frequently salver-shaped.\r\nThe anthers ultimately become spirally twisted (_E_). The style\r\nprolonged, deciduous. The flower has the _Lobelia_-arrangement,\r\n_i.e._ the median sepal is anterior; the corolla is rose-coloured (in\r\nthe native species). The capsule is semi-bilocular (Fig. 581 _F_,\r\n_G_).--~_Cicendia_ has a low creeping stem, fine as a thread, and\r\nsmall, yellow flowers, 4-merous (without twisted anther).--_Chlora_\r\n(Yellow-wort) 6–8-merous.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 581.--_Erythræa centaurium._ Inflorescence,\r\n  flower and fruit: _br^1_, _br^2_ floral-leaves of the 1st and 2nd\r\n  order; _G_ a valve of the capsule separated from its fellow.]\r\n\r\n=2.= MENYANTHEÆ. _Menyanthes_ (Buck-bean) deviates in several respects\r\nfrom the type of the order. The leaves are _scattered_ and, in _M.\r\ntrifoliata_, trifoliate; the corolla has _valvate_ æstivation; the\r\ntesta is also very hard (thin in the true Gentians). They are aquatic\r\nplants with creeping rhizome; the flowers borne in racemes, with\r\nterminal flower, heterostylous. The corolla is funnel-shaped with a\r\nvery hairy throat.--~_Limnanthemum_ with floating leaves, like the\r\nWater-lilies.~\r\n\r\n   575 species; distributed over the entire globe, but most\r\n   numerous in _Alpine_ districts. Neither poisonous nor nutritive\r\n   plants are found, but several are used in medicine on account of\r\n   the _bitter_ properties so prevalent amongst them. OFFICINAL:\r\n   the roots of _Gentiana lutea_. The roots of other species,\r\n   _e.g._ _G. purpurea_, _punctata_ and _pannonica_ (Europe) and\r\n   the leaves of _Menyanthes trifoliata_ are medicinal. Some are\r\n   grown as ornamental plants on account of the pure (often deep\r\n   blue) colour of the flowers.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Apocynaceæ= (=Periwinkles=). Trees and shrubs (also lianes),\r\nless frequently herbs, generally _with latex_. The leaves are\r\nopposite, simple, entire, _without stipules_; the flowers are regular;\r\ncorolla-lobes oblique, æstivation twisted. The stamens are individually\r\nfree, and the _pollen-grains are free_ or at most united in fours (see\r\nAsclepiadaceæ). The two carpels have 2–∞ ovules, in all cases there is\r\nonly 1 style and a capitate stigma, which towards the base is widened\r\nout into a disc-like table (stigma-disc) abstricted in the centre;\r\nbut the carpels in most of the genera (_e.g._ those mentioned below)\r\nare entirely separate, and the fruit consists of two _follicles_, the\r\nseeds of which often have a tuft of _woolly hairs_ projecting from the\r\nmicropyle, less frequently of two drupes. In some other genera there\r\nis a 1-locular (provided with 2 parietal placentæ) or a 2-locular ovary\r\nbecoming a 2-valved capsule or a berry. Endosperm abundant.\r\n\r\n_Vinca_ (Periwinkle) has a salver-shaped corolla, which is twisted\r\nto the left in æstivation (_i.e._ the left edge of the petals is\r\nfree); nectaries 2, alternating with the carpels; the summit of the\r\nstyle is hairy. Follicles; seeds without hairs. ~Mostly creeping,\r\nperennial, evergreen plants, whose large flowers are apparently\r\naxillary; in reality they are terminal, but by the development of\r\nthe bud in the axil of one of the two uppermost leaves, they are\r\nthus displaced over the other leaf of the pair (a helicoid sympodium\r\nbeing formed).--_Plumeria_, _Tabernæmontana_, _Cerbera_ (drupe).\r\n_Aspidosperma._~\r\n\r\n_Nerium_ (Oleander). The leaves are in whorls of 3. Corolla\r\nfunnel-shaped, in æstivation twisted to the right, and with a corona\r\nresembling that of _Lychnis_. The anthers are prolonged at the base\r\nand each also bears at the apex a long, linear, hairy appendage; these\r\nfinally become spirally twisted. Follicles; seeds hairy. _Apocynum_,\r\n_Echites_, etc. _Epigynum_ is epigynous.\r\n\r\n   124 genera, 1,000 species; principally in the Tropics. Only 2\r\n   species of _Vinca_ are natives of this country; the following\r\n   are cultivated as ornamental plants:--_Vinca minor_, _V. major_,\r\n   _V. (Lochnera) rosea_, _Amsonia salicifolia_, _Nerium oleander_\r\n   (Eastern Mediterranean). The _latex_ of some is _poisonous_\r\n   (_Tanghinia venenifera_, _Cerbera_). Caoutchouc is obtained from\r\n   others (_Hankornia_, _Landolphia_, _Vahea_, etc.). Tough bast is\r\n   frequently developed. The bark of _Aspidosperma quebracho_ and\r\n   the seeds of _Strophanthus hispidus_ are used in medicine (also\r\n   for African arrow-poison), the latter is officinal.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Asclepiadaceæ.= A natural and easily recognised order,\r\nclosely allied to the Apocynaceæ, having, like it, frequently a\r\npoisonous latex, opposite, single, entire leaves and fundamentally the\r\nsame floral diagram and floral structure (S5, P5, A5, G2); but in some\r\nthe æstivation of the corolla is valvate. The carpels here also have\r\n_free ovaries_, but are united for some distance above into a _large,\r\nshield-like, 5-angular head_, having on its underside the true stigmas,\r\nand the fruit always consists of 2 _follicles_; seeds most frequently\r\nnumerous and _hairy_ at the micropyle (“vegetable silk”); endosperm\r\nscanty.--The order is distinguished from the Apocynaceæ and from all\r\nother plants also, except the Orchids, by having all the pollen-grains\r\nin each of the =2= loculi of the anthers (true 2-locular anthers)\r\nunited into _one waxy, club-shaped pollen-mass_ (“pollinium”), for the\r\npurpose of pollination by insects. These heavy masses, in order to\r\nsecure pollination (as in the case of the Orchids), must be attached to\r\nsticky discs (corpuscula); there are 5 corpuscula, one at each of the\r\ncorners of the 5-angular stylar-head (alternating with the anthers),\r\nand to each of these are attached 2 pollinia, one from each of the\r\nanthers situated on either side (thus each anther gives its right\r\npollinium to one corpusculum and its left to another). The stamens are\r\nfrequently united at the base, and each bears on the back a variously\r\nformed, petaloid appendage, termed a “cucullus.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 582.--_Asclepias cornuti._ _A_ An open flower\r\n  with the calyx (_k_) and corolla (_c_) turned down; the stamens\r\n  are bent together and surround the gynœceum. _B_ The andrœcium\r\n  after removal of the sterile part (cucullus) of the anther, which\r\n  functions as a nectary: _e_ the lateral expansions of the fertile\r\n  portion of the anthers; _f_ the slit between the expansions of\r\n  two contiguous anthers, through which the insect’s foot, and\r\n  later a pollinium which is caught by it, is dragged, and behind\r\n  which the only receptive part (stigma) is hidden; above the slit\r\n  _f_ is the gland (_r_), which secretes the horny corpusculum,\r\n  which is split at its base and joined on either side with a\r\n  pollinium (this is more distinctly seen in _D_ and _E_). When\r\n  the foot of the insect is caught in the slit (_f_) and is drawn\r\n  upwards, it becomes entrapped in the slit of the corpusculum,\r\n  which is then pulled out together with the pollinia firmly\r\n  attached to it. In walking over the flowers the insect will draw\r\n  its foot through other slits (_f_) and so leave the pollinia on\r\n  the stigmas. _C_, _D_ The gynœceum with the pollinia hanging\r\n  freely. _E_ A corpusculum and two pollinia.]\r\n\r\nA peculiar relative position (and therefore a good, distinctive\r\ncharacteristic) is often found in the _inflorescence_, which is cymose;\r\nit is placed _between_ the two leaves of a whorl, nearer to one than to\r\nthe other. ~The leaf-pairs are placed obliquely in the floral region,\r\nat acute and obtuse angles, and not at right angles (as in the purely\r\nvegetative parts); the inflorescences are placed in two rows only which\r\nare nearly 90° from each other, and the two contiguous to one another\r\nare antidromous; they are in reality terminal, each on its own axis,\r\nand the entire floral portion of the shoot is a unipared scorpioid\r\ncymose sympodium; in addition, complications also arise through\r\nindividual parts becoming united.--Herbs and shrubs, some twining or\r\nclimbing.~\r\n\r\nIn _Asclepias_ the corolla is bent back and there is a cup-like\r\ncucullus, from the base of which protrudes a horn-shaped body, bent\r\ninwards.--_Vincetoxicum_ has a rotate corolla and a ring-like, 5-lobed\r\ncucullus, without internal prominences.--~_Stapelia_ (especially from\r\nS. Africa) is remarkable on account of its Cactus-like, leafless stems\r\nand large, brownish flowers, often with carrion-like smell. _Periploca_\r\nhas more powdery pollinia (S. Eur., etc.); _Hoya carnosa_ (Wax-flower;\r\nTrop. Asia) is a climber, and has small, annual, flower-bearing\r\ndwarf-branches. _Ceropegia._~\r\n\r\n   201 genera with 1700 species, distributed over all tropical\r\n   countries; few outside these limits: no native species. Several\r\n   are used in medicine on account of the pungent properties of the\r\n   latex. Condurango-bark of _Gonolobus condurango_ is medicinal.\r\n   Caoutchouc is obtained from the latex of some (_e.g._ from\r\n   _Cynanchum_). The seed-hairs, which are most frequently shining,\r\n   silk-like, and white, are not sufficiently pliant to be of much\r\n   value. Ornamental plants in our gardens: _Asclepias_-species,\r\n   etc.\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Loganiaceæ.= Ovary single, with two loculi, in\r\n   structure resembling the Rubiaceæ, but superior. 360 species\r\n   are included in this order; the majority are tree-like, some\r\n   lianes which climb by tendril-like branches. The _interpetiolar\r\n   stipules_ of some species are very characteristic (as in\r\n   Rubiaceæ, to which they maybe considered to be closely related).\r\n   The fruit is a capsule or berry. The most familiar genus\r\n   is _Strychnos_, which has spherical berries with an often\r\n   firm external layer, and compressed seeds with shield-like\r\n   attachments; endosperm abundant. The leaves have 3–5 strong,\r\n   curved nerves proceeding from the base.--_Spigelia._--They\r\n   have _no latex_, as in the two preceding orders, but many are\r\n   _very poisonous_ (containing the alkaloid “strychnine,” etc.);\r\n   the South American arrow-poison, urare or curare, is made from\r\n   various species of _Strychnos_, also an arrow-poison in the East\r\n   Indian Islands (Java, etc.). OFFICINAL, the seeds of _Strychnos\r\n   nux vomica_ (“Vomic nut,” Ind.). The seeds of _Strychnos\r\n   ignatii_ (Ignatius-beans, medicinal), and others are poisonous.\r\n\r\nOrder 5. =Oleaceæ.= The leaves are always opposite. The inflorescences\r\nare racemes or panicles. The calyx and corolla are _4-merous_,\r\nmore or less united, free in some species; the corolla has most\r\nfrequently _valvate_ æstivation. All four forms of fruit occur (see\r\nthe genera). _Ovules pendulous_, 2 in each loculus (Fig. 583 _C_).\r\nEndosperm oily.--_Syringa_ (Lilac) and _Forsythia_ (anthers somewhat\r\nextrose) have _capsules_ with loculicidal dehiscence and winged\r\nseeds.--_Fraxinus_ (Ash) has _winged nuts_ (samara) (Fig. 583 _D_);\r\ntrees with most frequently imparipinnate leaves; the flowers are\r\n_naked_ and sometimes unisexual (polygamous), the Manna Ash (_F.\r\nornus_) has however a double perianth with 4 free petals (Fig. 583\r\n_a_); in the native species, _F. excelsior_, the flowers open before\r\nthe foliage appears.--_Ligustrum_ (Privet) has _berries_.--_Olea_ (_O.\r\neuropæa_; Olive) has _drupes_; the pulp and seeds of the ellipsoidal\r\nfruits are rich in oil. The lanceolate leaves are grey on the under\r\nsurface, being covered with stellate hairs. In the wild state it is\r\nthorny (modified branches).--_Phillyrea_; _Chionanthus_.--Few species\r\nof _Linociera_ have 4 stamens.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 583.--_Fraxinus ornus_: _A_ flower; _ca_\r\n  calyx; co corolla; _B_ gynœceum and calyx; _C_ longitudinal\r\n  median section of gynœceum; _D_ fruit.]\r\n\r\n   180 species; chiefly in the northern temperate zone. The\r\n   _Olive-tree_ (_Olea europæa_) has been an important cultivated\r\n   plant from ancient times (Olive oil, Provence oil, “Sweet oil”).\r\n   The best oil is extracted from the fruit-pulp. The fruits are\r\n   edible. Home: Western Asia, Eastern Mediterranean. TIMBER:\r\n   the Ash (_Fr. excelsior_). OFFICINAL: the Manna Ash (_Fr.\r\n   ornus_), cultivated in the Mediterranean countries for the\r\n   sake of its saccharine juice, which flows out and coagulates\r\n   into “Manna.”--The following are ornamental plants: species of\r\n   _Ligustrum_ and _Syringa_ (introduced in the 16th century, from\r\n   S.E. Europe and Asia), _Forsythia_ (China, Japan; the large,\r\n   yellow flowers are borne on dwarf-branches with scale-like\r\n   leaves, before the opening of the foliage-leaves), _Chionanthus_.\r\n\r\n   Order 6. =Jasminaceæ.= The æstivation of the corolla is\r\n   _imbricate_; the _ovules are erect_; seeds almost without\r\n   endosperm; radicle directed downwards. The number of lobes\r\n   in the calyx and corolla is not 4, but _e.g._ 5, 8, 10,\r\n   and variations are sometimes found in the same individual.\r\n   The fruit is a berry or capsule. Many species are twiners,\r\n   and their scattered or opposite leaves are most frequently\r\n   imparipinnate.--120 species; especially in Trop. Asia (E.\r\n   India). Some _Jasminum_-species are cultivated as ornamental\r\n   shrubs in the warmer districts on account of their elegant\r\n   foliage, and beautiful, sweet-scented flowers, the essential\r\n   oil of which is also used in perfumery; the best known are: _J.\r\n   sambac_ and _grandiflorum_. _Nyctanthes arbor-tristis_ opens its\r\n   sweet-scented flowers only at night (E. India).\r\n\r\n   Order 7 (?). _Salvadoraceæ._ 8–9 species; Asia,\r\n   Africa.--_Salvadora._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                b. Tetracyclicæ with epigynous flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 33. =Rubiales.=\r\n\r\n_The leaves are always opposite or verticillate. The flower is\r\nepigynous_, ☿, 5-(or 4-) merous, with the usual sympetalous diagram;\r\n2–5 carpels. The inflorescences are frequently dichasial. The sepals\r\nare small, reduced to teeth, and become almost entirely suppressed\r\nin the higher forms.--The flower is regular in _Rubiaceæ_ and some\r\n_Caprifoliaceæ_, but in other genera of this latter order (especially\r\nof _Lonicereæ_) it is unsymmetrical. In several genera of the order\r\nfirst mentioned the loculi of the ovary contain many ovules, but in\r\nthe last the number of loculi and ovules becomes reduced. This is to\r\nsome extent connected with the nature of the fruit which is many-seeded\r\nin most instances, namely a capsule or berry, but in others nut-like.\r\nEndosperm is present.\r\n\r\n   The family on one side is allied to the Contortæ (not only\r\n   through the _Loganiaceæ_ but also through the _Apocynaceæ_), and\r\n   may be regarded as an epigynous continuation of this family; on\r\n   the other side it is allied to the Valerianaceæ and Dipsacaceæ.\r\n   Many points of agreement with the _Cornaceæ_ and _Araliaceæ_ are\r\n   also found, and in fact several Caprifoliaceæ are distinguished\r\n   from these by hardly any other feature than the gamopetalous\r\n   corolla.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 584.--_Cinchona calisaya._ Flowering branch.]\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Rubiaceæ.= Leaves opposite (or verticillate), undivided and\r\nentire, with _interpetiolar stipules_ (Fig. 586). Flowers epigynous\r\nand hermaphrodite, _regular_, 4- or 5-merous with the usual arrangement\r\n(Figs. 585, 588–590); corolla gamopetalous, in æstivation often\r\nvalvate; ovary _frequently 2-locular_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 585.--_Cinchona calisaya._ _A_ entire flower;\r\n  _B_ after removal of the corolla; _C_ longitudinal section of\r\n  ovary; _D_ fruit; _E_ seed.]\r\n\r\n   There are no external characters which at once distinguish\r\n   this exceedingly large order, as in many other natural orders\r\n   (Compositæ, Umbelliferæ, etc.), but the _opposite_ leaves with\r\n   _interpetiolar stipules_ form an excellent mark of recognition.\r\n   It is divided into many sub-orders and groups, especially\r\n   characterised by the nature of the ovary (1 or several ovules\r\n   in each loculus), and of the fruit (schizocarp, berry, drupe,\r\n   capsule).--The corolla is bilabiate in 4 genera; its æstivation\r\n   in some is twisted; in _Capirona_, etc., the filaments are of\r\n   unequal size. The ovary is semi-epigynous in _Henriquezia_, etc.\r\n   In _Morinda_ all the fleshy fruits coalesce into one multiple\r\n   fruit.\r\n\r\n=1.= CINCHONEÆ. The fruit is a 2-valved _capsule_, with many winged\r\nseeds (Fig. 585). _Cinchona_ (Quinine, Fig. 584). Trees and shrubs\r\nwith the foliage and inflorescence somewhat resembling _Syringa_;\r\nthe corolla also being of a lilac colour, more or less salver- or\r\nfunnel-shaped, and frequently edged with a fringe of hairs (Fig. 585),\r\nis somewhat similar to that of _Menyanthes_. Their home is the Andes\r\nfrom Bolivia to Venezuela, varying in altitude from 1–3000 metres.\r\nThere are now large plantations in Java and E. India. ~(The name\r\n“quinine” is of Indian origin; that of the genus “_Cinchona_,” is from\r\nthe Spanish Duchess Cinchon, who in 1638 first introduced the bark into\r\nEurope.) The following are closely allied: _Cascarilla_, _Remijia_,\r\n_Ladenbergia_, _Manettia_, _Bouvardia_, etc.~\r\n\r\n=2.= GARDENIEÆ. Trees and shrubs, frequently having a many-locular\r\nberry. _Randia_, _Gardenia_, _Genipa_, _Hamelia_, etc.\r\n\r\n=3.= COFFEEÆ. Only 1 seed in each of the two loculi of the ovary;\r\n_the fruit is a drupe with 2 stones_. _Coffea_ has an ellipsoidal\r\nfruit about the size and colour of a cherry; the two thin-shelled,\r\nparchment-like stones are enclosed by a thin layer of pulp; the two\r\nseeds are flat on the side turned to one another, which has also a\r\ndeep, longitudinal groove curving to the sides. The endosperm is hard,\r\nhorny and greyish (without starch); the small embryo lies in the lower\r\nend near the circumference. The Coffee-plant (_C. arabica_) is a small\r\ntree, or more frequently, and especially in plantations, a shrub with\r\nlarge dark-green leaves and scented, white flowers. Its home is in\r\nTropical Africa; it is now cultivated in many tropical countries.\r\n_C. liberica_, W. Africa.--_Cephaëlis_ (_C. ipecacuanha_, Fig. 586;\r\nthe roots are officinal).--~_Psychotria_, _Chiococca_, _Ixora_,\r\n_Hydnophytum_, _Myrmecodia_, etc.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 586.--_Cephaëlis ipecacuanha._ Portion of a\r\n  branch: _st_ stipules.]\r\n\r\n=4.= SPERMACOCEÆ. Chiefly small shrubs and herbs, many of which\r\nare weeds in tropical countries. The stipular sheaths bear\r\nnumerous bristles at the edge. _Spermacoce_, _Borreria_, _Diodia_,\r\n_Richardsonia_, etc.\r\n\r\n=5.= STELLATÆ. _Herbaceous plants with_ verticillate leaves (Figs.\r\n587, 588–590); _the stipules are large, leaf-like_, and resemble the\r\nlamina of the leaves, so that _the leaves appear to be placed several\r\nin a whorl_, while in reality there are only two opposite leaves, the\r\nstipules of which project _freely_, and are not erect (Fig. 587).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 587.--_Rubia tinctorum._]\r\n\r\nIn some cases there are apparently 4 leaves in the whorl, and then 2 of\r\nthese are leaves, and the other two are their interpetiolar stipules.\r\nWhen there are apparently 6 leaves, then the two of these which are\r\nopposite each other are leaves, and the other four are stipules;\r\nif there are several members in the whorl, then a division of the\r\nstipules has taken place. The proof of this theory is founded upon\r\nthe fact that not more than 2 of the leaves of the whorl ever support\r\nbuds (which, in addition, are seldom of equal vigour), and also that\r\nthe whorls do not alternate with each other, which, according to the\r\nrules of the position of the leaves, they should do if all the members\r\nof a whorl had equal value. If there are, for instance, 4 members in\r\ntwo successive whorls, they stand right above one another, and do not\r\nalternate. The development and anatomical relations (the branching of\r\nthe vascular bundles) also point to the same conclusion.~--All the\r\nother groups of the order have only 2 small scale-like interpetiolar\r\nstipules, or they form at the base of the leaf-stalks an interpetiolar\r\nsheath, having often a toothed edge (Fig. 586).--Another characteristic\r\nfeature in this group is that the calyx is rudimentary, the corolla\r\n_valvate_ (Fig. 588), and that each of the two loculi of the ovary has\r\nonly 1 ovule. The fruit is a _schizocarp dividing into 2 fruitlets_\r\n(Fig. 590). ~The forms of the fruit, as well as many other characters,\r\nas, for example, the epigynous flower, the rudimentary calyx, the two\r\nfree or almost free styles, present interesting analogous resemblances\r\nto the polypetalous order of the Umbelliferæ.~ This group has its home\r\nchiefly in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, especially\r\nabout the Mediterranean; it is the only group which occurs in this\r\ncountry, represented by 4 genera.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 588–590.--_Rubia tinctorum._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 588.--Diagram.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 589.--Longitudinal section of flower.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 590.--Longitudinal section of fruit (3/1).]\r\n\r\n_Galium_ (Cleavers) is almost destitute of a calyx; it has a\r\nsmall _4-partite, rotate corolla_, 4 stamens, and 2 free styles.\r\nThe fruitlets are _nut-like_. The inflorescence is a paniculate\r\ndichasium passing into helicoid cymes.--_Asperula_ (Woodruff) is\r\ndistinguished from the above by its salver- or funnel-shaped corolla.\r\n1 style.--_Rubia_ (Madder, Figs. 587–590) has almost the same form of\r\ncorolla as _Galium_, but (most frequently) a _5-merous flower_, and the\r\nfruitlets are “_drupes_.” ~_Sherardia_ (Field Madder); the flowers are\r\nclustered in closely arranged cymes surrounded by _an involucre_; _the\r\ncalyx has 6 distinct teeth_, while the number of petals and stamens is\r\n4. The corolla is funnel-shaped.--_Vaillantia._ _Crucianella._~\r\n\r\n   The DISTRIBUTION OF SEEDS, in some instances, is promoted by\r\n   hooked appendages on the fruitlets (_e.g._ _Galium aparine_).\r\n\r\n   The small flowers of the Stellatæ are frequently collected\r\n   in compact inflorescences, and are therefore rendered more\r\n   conspicuous; slight protandry is found in some, self-pollination\r\n   in the species which are less conspicuous. Many species are\r\n   heterostylous. _Myrmecodia_, _Hydnophytum_, and other genera\r\n   have large tubers (hypocotyledonous stems), whose labyrinthine\r\n   cavities and passages are inhabited by ants.\r\n\r\n   About 4,500 species; tropical or sub-tropical except the\r\n   Stellatæ; especially American. The tropical ones are mostly\r\n   trees.--Several are ~OFFICINAL~ on account of the large\r\n   amount of _alkaloids_ and _glycosides_ which they contain. The\r\n   most important are the Cinchonas (_Cinchona calisaya_, _C.\r\n   succirubra_, _C. officinalis_, _C. micrantha_, etc.), whose bark\r\n   contains the well-known febrifuge and tonic, Quinine, Cinchonin,\r\n   etc.; Quinine is also found in _Exostemma_, _Ladenbergia_, and\r\n   _Remijia_. The root “Ipecacuanha” (an emetic) from _Cephaëlis\r\n   ipecacuanha_ (Brazils). Caffeine is officinal. The use of the\r\n   seeds of the coffee plant (“the beans”) was first known in\r\n   Europe in 1583.--There are only a few which contain _aromatic_\r\n   properties, principally among the Stellatæ (coumarin in\r\n   _Asperula odorata_, the Woodruff), in which group _colouring\r\n   materials_ are also found. The root and root-stalks of _Rubia\r\n   tinctorum_, the Madder (S. Eur., Orient., Fig. 587), were\r\n   formerly largely used for dyeing, but are now superseded by\r\n   the analine colours. Red dyes are also obtained from the roots\r\n   of species of _Asperula_ and _Galium_. Gambier is a splendid\r\n   colouring material, obtained from _Uncaria gambir_ (S.E. Asia),\r\n   which is used in dyeing and tanning.--The order does not furnish\r\n   many ornamental flowers.\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Caprifoliaceæ.= This order agrees with the Rubiaceæ in having\r\nopposite leaves and an epigynous flower, most frequently 5-merous\r\nwith the ordinary tetracyclic diagram, but in some species it is\r\nzygomorphic; the corolla has imbricate æstivation, _carpels 3–5, most\r\nfrequently 3_ (not 2, which is the most usual number in the Rubiaceæ).\r\nThe fruit is generally a _berry_ or a _drupe_, but the most important,\r\nand in any case most easily recognisable feature, is the _absence of\r\nstipules_; in exceptional cases, where they are present, they are not\r\ninterpetiolar, and are most frequently small.--~The majority of plants\r\nbelonging to this order are shrubs or trees. Compound leaves sometimes\r\noccur. Stipules only appear in a few species of _Lonicera_, _Sambucus_\r\nand _Viburnum_; in the common Elder (_Sambucus nigra_) they are in\r\nsome instances glandular and small, but in other cases larger and more\r\nleaf-like (upon long, well-developed shoots); in the Dwarf Elder (_S.\r\nebulus_) they have the normal leaf-like form; in _Viburnum opulus_ they\r\nare present as narrow lobes at the base of the petiole; in others they\r\nare completely absent. The leaves are frequently penninerved, rarely\r\npalminerved. The calyx, as in the Stellatæ and Aggregatæ, is often very\r\ninsignificant.~\r\n\r\n=1.= LONICEREÆ, HONEYSUCKLE GROUP. This has _campanulate or tubular\r\ncorollas_ which are often zygomorphic; in connection with the length of\r\nthe corolla the _style is long, filamentous_, and most frequently has a\r\nlarge, capitate stigma. There are _several ovules_ in the loculi of the\r\novary, and the fruit is most frequently a _berry_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 591.--_Lonicera._]\r\n\r\n_Lonicera_ (Honeysuckle). Shrubs, sometimes twiners. The corolla in\r\nsome species is considerably bilabiate (Fig. 591), with 4 lobes in\r\nthe upper lip, and 1 in the under lip, but in others more regular,\r\ntubular, or campanulate. The flowers are either borne in capitate\r\ninflorescences, which are compound and formed of closely compressed\r\n3-flowered dichasia (sect. _Caprifolium_), or in dichasia with 2\r\nflowers (the terminal flower is wanting). The ovaries and fruits\r\ncoalesce in some (sect. _Xylosteum_). ~The opposite leaves in some\r\nspecies unite with each other and form a broad collar encircling the\r\nstem (Fig. 591). Above the primary bud 1–2 accessory buds are often\r\nfound in the leaf-axils.--_Diervilla_ (_Weigelia_); with a 2-locular,\r\n2-valved capsule.--_Symphoricarpus_ (Snowberry) has an almost regular,\r\nfunnel-shaped corolla; a peculiar feature is found in the ovary which\r\nhas 4 loculi, the 2 median having many ovules in 2 rows, all of which\r\nare aborted; the 2 lateral ones, on the other hand, each have only 1\r\novule which is developed. Different forms of leaves are frequently\r\nfound on the same branch; they are entire or lobed.~\r\n\r\n=2.= SAMBUCEÆ, ELDER GROUP (Fig. 592). This has a _rotate_, _regular\r\ncorolla_, extrorse anthers, a very short and thick (or almost absent)\r\n_style_, with tripartite stigmas, and only 1 pendulous ovule in each of\r\nthe 3 (-5) loculi of the ovary. The fruit is a “_drupe_” with 1–3 (-5)\r\nstones. The inflorescence is made up of _cymes grouped in an umbel-like\r\narrangement_.\r\n\r\n_Sambucus_ (Elder, Fig. 592) has _imparipinnate_ leaves and a “drupe”\r\nwith 3 (-5) _stones_. Between the calyx and the style a disc remains\r\non the apex of the fruit. _S. nigra_ with black fruit; _S. racemosa_\r\nwith red fruit; _S. ebulus_ is a perennial herb; the others are\r\nwoody.--_Viburnum_ (Guelder-rose) has _simple_ leaves (penninerved\r\nor palminerved, entire, dentate or lobed), and a “drupe” with only 1\r\n_stone_, which is compressed, cartilaginous, and parchment-like; 2 of\r\nthe loculi of the ovary are aborted. ~(In _V. opulus_ the marginal\r\nflowers of the inflorescence are barren, and in that case their\r\ncorollas are generally specially large; the cultivated _Viburnum_ has\r\nonly barren flowers, with large corollas.)~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 592.--_Sambucus nigra_: _cor_ corolla; _s_\r\n  calyx.]\r\n\r\n=3.= LINNÆEÆ. _Linnæa borealis_ (the only species) is an extreme form\r\nof the order; it has a 2-flowered dichasium, funnel-shaped, slightly\r\nbilabiate corollas (2/3); 4 didynamous stamens. Two of the 3 loculi of\r\nthe ovary have several ovules which are not developed, while the third\r\nhas only 1 ovule, which developes into a seed. The fruit is a nut,\r\nwhich is enveloped by the two large bracteoles, which are covered by\r\nsticky, glandular hairs, and serve as a means of distribution. It is a\r\nsmall undershrub.\r\n\r\n   [_Adoxa_, which was formerly classed in this order, appears,\r\n   according to recent investigations, to be more properly placed\r\n   among the Saxifraginæ.]\r\n\r\n   In cases where the flowers are small, as in _Sambucus_ and\r\n   _Viburnum opulus_, they are rendered conspicuous by being\r\n   arranged in closely-packed inflorescences; they are massed\r\n   together and form large surfaces, and in the last named are\r\n   still more conspicuous on account of the barren, but large\r\n   ray-flowers, which are of service in this respect. Honey is\r\n   secreted in the nectaries at the base of the styles. In the\r\n   genera with rotate flowers, as _Viburnum_ and other Sambuceæ,\r\n   the honey lies so exposed and in such a thin layer, that only\r\n   flies and insects with short probosces can procure it; bees,\r\n   however, visit these flowers for the sake of the pollen. There\r\n   is hardly any nectar in the Elder; self-pollination frequently\r\n   takes place. The flowers of the Caprifoliaceæ, which, with their\r\n   long corolla-tube are adapted for evening-and night-flying\r\n   insects with long probosces, open in the evening, and at that\r\n   time give off their strongest scent.\r\n\r\n   DISTRIBUTION. 230 species; especially outside the Tropics in the\r\n   Northern Hemisphere. In this country they are found especially\r\n   in hedges and as under-shrubs.--OFFICINAL: the flowers and\r\n   fresh fruits of the Elder (_S. nigra_), the fruits (“berries”)\r\n   being also used in the household. ORNAMENTAL SHRUBS: species of\r\n   _Lonicera_, _Symphoricarpus_, _Diervilla_, which are chiefly\r\n   from N. Am., _Abelia_ and _Viburnum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 34. =Dipsacales.=\r\n\r\nThe leaves are _opposite and without stipules_. The flower (Figs. 593,\r\n595, 598, 599, 600) is _epigynous_, _zygomorphic_ or _asymmetrical_,\r\n5-merous with S5, P5, stamens typically 5, but by suppression _never\r\nmore than 4_, sometimes less, carpels 3–2. The calyx is more or\r\nless insignificant, and almost suppressed in the extreme forms. The\r\novary has 3–1 loculi, but _only one loculus_ has an ovule, which is\r\n_pendulous_ with the micropyle _turned upwards_ (Fig. 594). Fruit a\r\nnut. Embryo straight, with the radicle _pointing upwards_ (Fig. 597),\r\nwithout or with endosperm.\r\n\r\nThe inflorescences are distinct dichasia in Valerianaceæ, but in\r\nDipsacaceæ and Calyceraceæ they are crowded together into capitula.\r\n\r\n   This family is closely allied to the Rubiales through the\r\n   Valerianaceæ, which have almost the same structure as many\r\n   of the Caprifoliaceæ. It attains the highest development in\r\n   the Dipsacaceæ, which are composite plants, but differs from\r\n   Compositæ in the position of the ovule, etc.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Valerianaceæ.= Herbaceous plants or under-shrubs with\r\nopposite leaves, often pinnate; stipules absent. The flowers are\r\nborne in _dichasia_ and in _scorpioid cymose inflorescences_ and are\r\n_entirely without any plane of symmetry_ (Fig. 593). The calyx and\r\ncorolla are 5-merous, but the calyx is frequently very insignificant\r\nand ultimately a pappus, as in Compositæ; the corolla is frequently\r\nsaccate or produced into a spur at the base. Most frequently, only 3\r\n(4–1) of the 5 stamens are developed; these are free. Carpels =3=,\r\nwhich form an inferior _ovary_, often with 3 _loculi_, but only _1 of\r\nthe loculi_ contains =1= _pendulous, anatropous ovule_ (Figs. 593, 594\r\n_A_), the other loculi are empty and shrink up more or less completely.\r\n(Compare Fig. 593 _A_, _B_). Style 1, stigma tripartite. Endosperm\r\nabsent; embryo straight, with the radicle directed _upwards_.\r\n\r\n   The inflorescences are dichasia, or unipared scorpioid cymes\r\n   with the branches developed in the axil of the second bracteole.\r\n   Both the bracteoles are generally present and frequently form\r\n   4 very regular, longitudinal rows on the branches of the\r\n   inflorescence.--5 stamens do not occur (except perhaps in\r\n   _Patrinia_). The suppression of stamens and carpels takes place\r\n   most readily on the anterior side of the flower and that turned\r\n   towards the first bracteole (_a_) (Fig. 593), whose branch is\r\n   suppressed in the dichasium; after this the posterior median\r\n   stamen is next suppressed.\r\n\r\n   By the vegetative characters as well as by the inflorescence\r\n   and the flower, the order is allied to the Caprifoliaceæ and\r\n   especially to the Sambuceæ.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 593.--_A_ Diagram of _Valeriana officinalis_.\r\n  _B_ Diagram of _Centranthus_.]\r\n\r\nIn the least modified (oldest) forms, _Patrinia_ and _Nardostachys_,\r\nthere is an almost regular flower, a 5-merous calyx, 4 stamens, and\r\n3 loculi in the ovary, 2 of which however are barren. The stamens in\r\n_Valerianella_ are reduced to 3, in _Fedia_ to 2 (posterior), and\r\nthe calyx is less distinctly 5-dentate; the 2 empty loculi in the\r\novary are still visible. _Fedia_ has a small spur at the base of the\r\ncorolla. _Valeriana_ has a very reduced, hair-like calyx (pappus), an\r\nunsymmetrical, salver-shaped corolla with a _sac-like_, nectariferous\r\nspur at the base, 3 stamens and only 1 loculus in the ovary (Figs. 594,\r\n593). _Centranthus_ (Fig. 593) is still further reduced. The corolla\r\nhas a spur and only 1 stamen; ~unipared scorpioid cymes with 4 rows\r\nof bracteoles. In the last two genera there is a peculiar wall in the\r\ncorolla-tube, which divides it longitudinally into two compartments\r\n(indicated by a dotted line in Fig. 593), one of which encloses the\r\nstyle. This wall is low in _Valeriana_, but in _Centranthus_ it reaches\r\nas far as the throat.--The rays of the _pappus_ are pinnately branched\r\nand rolled up before the ripening of the fruit. 12–20 in number (Fig.\r\n594 _A_, _B_).~\r\n\r\n   _Val. officinalis_ and others are protandrous: in the first\r\n   period the stamens project from the centre of the flower (Fig.\r\n   595 _a_), the stigmas in the second (_b_) when the stamens have\r\n   become bent backwards. (_V. dioica_ is diœcious with large ♂-and\r\n   small ♀-flowers).--275 species; especially from the temperate\r\n   and colder parts of the northern hemisphere of the Old World,\r\n   Western North America and the Andes.--_Bitter_ properties are\r\n   characteristic, such for instance as the volatile acid and\r\n   volatile oil of _Valeriana_; these occur especially in the\r\n   rhizomes. OFFICINAL; the rhizomes of _V. officinalis_.--The true\r\n   Indian “Nardus,” an important medicine and perfume in India,\r\n   is extracted from _Nardostachys_ (Himalaya). A variety of\r\n   _Valerianella olitoria_ is sometimes used as salad.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 594.--_Valeriana_: _A_ ovary (longitudinal\r\n  section); _B_ ripe fruit.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 595.--_Valeriana_: _a_ flower in the ♂ stage;\r\n  _b_ in the ♀.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 596.--_Centranthus ruber._ Flower, its\r\n  lowermost portion (the ovary and spur) in longitudinal section.\r\n  (Mag.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 597.--_Scabiosa atropurpurea._ Fruit in\r\n  longitudinal section. Inside the “epicalyx” may be seen the fruit\r\n  drawn out into a beak, with straight embryo and radicle directed\r\n  upwards.]\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Dipsacaceæ= (=Teasels=). Herbs with _opposite_ leaves without\r\nstipules. The flowers are situated in compact capitula each with an\r\ninvolucre. A characteristic feature of the order is that _each flower_\r\nof the capitulum has a _gamophyllous_ “_epicalyx_” (Figs. 597, 599,\r\n600), which envelopes the inferior ovary. The flowers (Figs. 599, 600)\r\nare ☿, 5-merous (S5, P5, stamens typically 5, G=2=), but the calyx\r\noften expands at the edge into a membrane with 5, or an indefinite\r\nnumber of bristles or teeth (pappus, Figs. 597, 600), and the\r\n_zygomorphic, funnel-shaped corolla_ is sometimes 5-lobed and bilabiate\r\n(2/3), but most frequently 4-partite (Fig. 599), the two lobes of the\r\nupper lip coalescing into one lobe, as in certain Labiatæ, _Veronica_\r\nand _Plantago_; the æstivation is _imbricate_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 598–600.--_Dipsacus fullonum._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 598.--Inflorescence (the flowers in a zone below the apex\r\n  commence to flower first).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 599.--Flower (4/1).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 600.--The same in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\n_The stamens are never more than 4_, the posterior one _remaining\r\nundeveloped_; they _usually have free anthers_ which generally project\r\nconsiderably (Fig. 599). The ovary is unilocular with 1 _pendulous_\r\novule and bears 1 _undivided style_; fruit a nut with 1 _seed,\r\ncontaining endosperm_ and with the radicle turned _upwards_ (Fig. 597).\r\n\r\n   The flowers do not always open in centripetal order, a fact\r\n   which may be observed especially in the Dipsacaceæ, in which a\r\n   zone of flowers round the centre of the capitulum opens first,\r\n   and the flowering then proceeds both upwards and downwards\r\n   (Fig. 598). This has probably some connection with the fact\r\n   that the capitulum has arisen from the coalescence of several\r\n   dichasial inflorescences. In species of _Scabiosa_ the flowers\r\n   open simultaneously at the circumference, or in a zone at the\r\n   centre.--The morphological explanation of the “_epicalyx_”\r\n   is not quite certain; in all probability it is formed from\r\n   two united bracteoles, for an “epicalyx” is distinctly formed\r\n   in this way in one of the Valerianaceæ, _Phyllactis_.--The\r\n   _ray-flowers_ are larger and more irregular, labiate or\r\n   ligulate, than the disc-flowers, yet not in so high a degree as\r\n   in the Compositæ.\r\n\r\n=A.= A scarious bract to each flower. _Scabiosa_ has a 5-lobed\r\ncorolla; the “epicalyx” has a dry, scarious, often finally large\r\ncollar, and the true calyx is formed of long bristles (generally 5)\r\n(Fig. 597). _Succisa pratensis_ (Devil’s-bit) has a 4-lobed corolla,\r\nthe collar of the “epicalyx” is herbaceous; the calyx as in the\r\npreceding.--_Pterocephalus._--_Dipsacus_ (Teasel); large, spiny and\r\nstiff-haired herbs with capitula, or short, thick spikes on which\r\nboth the involucral-leaves and bracts project considerably, and are\r\nstiff and spinose (Fig. 598). The “epicalyx” has short teeth, or is\r\nalmost entire. ~The leaves of the stem unite together in pairs, so\r\nthat shallow cups are formed round the stems in which rain-water may\r\ncollect.--_Cephalaria._--_Morina_: the flowers are falsely verticillate\r\nas in the Labiatæ; the calyx has 2 laterally-placed, entire, or\r\nemarginate lobes; 2 stamens, or 2 large and 2 small ones.~\r\n\r\n=B.= Bristles, but _no_ true bract to each flower. _Knautia_; the\r\ncorolla is 4-partite, the calyx cup-like, with many bristles or teeth\r\non the edge.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION is in many species effected by insects. The\r\n   honey is secreted by a ring round the base of the style. The\r\n   flowers in our native species are considerably protandrous.\r\n   Gynodiœcious flowers also occur.--150 species; especially in\r\n   the Mediterranean and the Orient; the order is not represented\r\n   in the South Sea Islands, Australia and America.--The heads of\r\n   the true Teasel (_Dips. fullonum_) are used for carding wool, on\r\n   account of the elastic bracts, which are hooked at the point.\r\n   The order has bitter properties; tanin, etc.; but no species are\r\n   used in medicine or the household.--_Scabiosa atropurpurea_,\r\n   etc., are used as ornamental plants.\r\n\r\n   Order 3. =Calyceraceæ.= This order resembles the Compositæ in\r\n   the valvate æstivation of the corolla and the more or less\r\n   united stamens, and the Dipsacaceæ in the undivided style,\r\n   pendulous ovule and endosperm. The calyx is frequently composed\r\n   of 5 distinct scales. An “epicalyx” is wanting.--20 species;\r\n   America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Family 35. =Campanulinæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flower is _epigynous_, perfect, with 5 sepals, 5 petals, and 5\r\nstamens in regular alternation, and =3= (2–5) carpels. The sepals\r\nin all cases are _distinct_, but narrow and pointed, so that the\r\næstivation is open. The corolla is gamopetalous with (as in the\r\nCompositæ) _valvate_, or slightly infolded-valvate æstivation. The\r\nstamens are nearly always _situated on the torus_ without being united\r\nto the corolla (Figs. 601, 604). The anthers adhere or unite and form\r\na tube with introrse anthers from which the pollen is swept out by the\r\nprojecting, brush-like hairs on the style (as in the Compositæ). The\r\novary is =3=-(2–5) locular, _many ovules_ in each loculus. The fruit is\r\ngenerally a _many-seeded_ capsule (or berry). Embryo in the centre of\r\na fleshy _endosperm_.--The majority are herbs with scattered leaves,\r\nwithout stipules. The presence of _latex_ and _inulin_, together with\r\nthe tubular formation of the anthers, the pollination, etc., indicate\r\na relationship with the Compositæ.\r\n\r\n   The _Cucurbitaceæ_ are by some authorities placed in this family\r\n   as being most closely related to the Campanulaceæ. Although the\r\n   corolla is most frequently gamopetalous, and other similarities\r\n   to the Campanulaceæ are present, yet on account of the structure\r\n   of the ovule, and for other reasons, the Cucurbitaceæ are\r\n   here placed in the Choripetalæ. The Campanulinæ without doubt\r\n   proceed upwards to the Compositæ, with which, in addition to\r\n   the occurrence of inulin and laticiferous vessels (Cichorieæ),\r\n   there are many corresponding features both in the structural\r\n   and biological relations (epigyny, valvate æstivation of the\r\n   corolla, tendency of the anthers to adhere or unite, protandry\r\n   with a stylar-brush, etc.) The inflorescence of _Jasione_ is\r\n   almost identical with that of the Compositæ.\r\n\r\nOrder 1. =Campanulaceæ= (=Campanulas=). The flowers are _regular_ and\r\nin some only semi-epigynous, 5-merous, except in the gynœceum which is\r\n3-merous (the unpaired, median carpel being generally posterior), more\r\nrarely 2–5-merous, and has a corresponding number of stigmas and loculi\r\nin the ovary; the placentation is axile with a large number of ovules.\r\nThe median sepal is posterior. The stamens frequently have broad, free\r\nbases (Fig. 601 _H_) which cover the nectariferous upper surface of\r\nthe ovary; the anthers only fit loosely together, and become separated\r\nas soon, as the pollen is shed (Fig. 601 _G_), 1 long style, which\r\nis studded by sweeping-hairs (stylar-brush), which ultimately become\r\ninvaginated; the stigmas do not unfold until the stamens have shed\r\nthe pollen (Fig. 601 _E_, _G_). Fruit a capsule.--Herbs, more rarely\r\nunder-shrubs or shrubs, with latex and scattered, undivided leaves\r\nwithout stipules. The inflorescence is most frequently a raceme or\r\nspike _with_ terminal flower.\r\n\r\n=A.= Capsule opening at the side by pores and small valves: _Campanula_\r\n(Canterbury-bell); the corolla is bell-shaped, rarely almost rotate;\r\ncapsule obconical. ~The pores of the capsule are found near the top of\r\nthe fruit when it is erect, and near the base when it is pendulous, so\r\nthat the seeds are not liberated unless the capsule is forcibly shaken,\r\nand they are thus ejected to a considerable distance.~--_Phyteuma_\r\n(Rampion) has free petals, which for a long time adhere at the\r\napex and form a tube round the stamens (Fig. 601); inflorescence\r\ncompact, spike-like or capitate, in the latter case resembling\r\nthat of the Compositæ, and frequently with an involucre similar to\r\nthe one possessed by this order. ~_Specularia_ (rotate corolla,\r\nprismatic capsule), _Michauxia_ (flower 8-merous).--_Symphyandra_ has\r\nsyngenesious anthers.~\r\n\r\n=B.= Capsule with valves at the apex, loculicidal dehiscence:\r\n_Jasione_; the petals are almost free. The anthers are united at the\r\nbase (syngenesious). The flowers are situated in capitate umbels with\r\ninvolucres.--_Wahlenbergia_; _Platycodon_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 601.--_Phyteuma spicatum._ Flowers and parts\r\n  of flowers in various stages of development.]\r\n\r\n=C.= Berry: _Canarina_; flower, 6-merous; leaves opposite.\r\n\r\nProtandry is general (Fig. 601). 510 species; principally in temperate\r\ncountries. Several genera furnish ornamental plants, but are of\r\nlittle use for other purposes. The roots of some _Campanula_-and\r\n_Phyteuma_-species are large and may serve as pot-herbs (_C.\r\nrapunculus_, _P. spicatum_).\r\n\r\nOrder 2. =Cyphiaceæ.= In this order the corolla is zygomorphic and the\r\nstamens free, hence it is intermediate between orders 1 and 3.--About\r\n24 species; Africa.\r\n\r\nOrder 3. =Lobeliaceæ= (=Lobelias=). This order may briefly be described\r\nas Campanulaceæ with _zygomorphic_ flowers and anthers _united into\r\na tube_, in most cases slightly bent; generally 2 carpels and an\r\n_inverted_ position of the flower, _i.e._ the median sepal is turned\r\nanteriorly (Fig. 602) (a position which is found to occur within the\r\nCampanulaceæ). A twisting of the peduncle takes place even before\r\nflowering (as in the Orchids) so that the ordinary position of the\r\n5-merous Dicotyledons appears to be restored. The zygomorphy of the\r\nflower is especially present in the corolla, which has a _bipartite_\r\nunder-lip and a _tripartite_ upper-lip, and is, in _Lobelia_,\r\nanteriorly (apparently posteriorly) deeply cleft (Fig. 602). There\r\nis 1 style, but the stigma is capitate and bilobed and surrounded\r\nat its base by a _whorl of hairs_, which assists in pollination\r\n(as a stylar-brush) in the same manner as the sweeping-hairs in the\r\nCampanulaceæ and Compositæ. There is _no terminal flower_ in the\r\nspicate, or racemose inflorescences.--_Lobelia_ has a capsule, several\r\nothers have berries. ~_Isotoma_ (regular flower); _Heterotoma_ has a\r\nspur; _Siphocampylos_; _Lysipoma_ (pyxidium); _Clintonia_ (1–locular\r\nfruit). _Metzleria_ (all the petals are free).~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 602.--Diagram of _Lobelia fulgens_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 603, 604.--_Lobelia syphilitica._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 603. Flower (2/1).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 604.--Longitudinal section of the same.]\r\n\r\n   Entomophilous and protandrous. About 500 species, especially\r\n   in the Tropics; in this country, _L. dortmanna_ (margin of\r\n   lakes).--Several are cultivated in gardens and conservatories as\r\n   ornamental plants (_Lobelia bicolor_, _erinus_, _fulgens_, etc.,\r\n   _Siphocampylos_, _Centropogon_). The latex of several species\r\n   of _Tupa_ is poisonous; caoutchouc is also obtained from them.\r\n   OFFICINAL: “herba _Lobeliæ_” (the alkaloid lobeline) from the\r\n   poisonous _L. inflata_ (N. Am.).\r\n\r\n   Order 4. =Goodeniaceæ.= Chiefly Australian (200 species),\r\n   closely related to Orders 3 and 5, but without latex. The style\r\n   is provided with a “collecting-cup” which receives the pollen\r\n   before the flower opens; it has a small, hairy aperture through\r\n   which the pollen is forced out by the stigmas, and through\r\n   which they emerge when the pollen is shed; it is sensitive and\r\n   exhibits movements when touched.--Herbs, under-shrubs, less\r\n   frequently shrubs. _Goodenia_, _Leschenaultia_, _Scævola_.\r\n\r\n   Order 5. =Stylidiaceæ= (or =Candolleaceæ=); 100 species,\r\n   the majority Australian; zygomorpbic flowers, but with the\r\n   ordinary position. The anterior petal is very small. The chief\r\n   characteristic feature is the presence of only 2 stamens (with\r\n   extrorse anthers) which are united with the style and form a\r\n   _stylar-column_; this is bent like a knee and sensitive at\r\n   the bend to such a degree that when touched it jerks violently\r\n   across the flower to the opposite side and then loses its\r\n   sensitiveness.--Herbs, less frequently under-shrubs. _Stylidium_\r\n   (_Candollea_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Family 36. =Aggregatæ.=\r\n\r\nThe flowers, which are borne in “capitula” (Figs. 605, 610), are\r\n_epigynous_ (Fig. 605 _C_, _D_), _5-merous_ in the calyx, corolla and\r\nandrœcium, the corolla is _valvate_ in æstivation, with =2= carpels\r\n(S5, P5, A5, G2). The anthers are united into a tube (syngenesious)\r\n(except _Ambrosieæ_) which surrounds the bifid style. There is never\r\nmore than =1= _loculus_ in the ovary, with =1= _erect_, anatropous\r\novule. The fruit is a 1–seeded nut (cypsela), with thin pericarp, the\r\ncalyx generally persists as a tuft of hairs (_pappus_) (Fig. 606)\r\non the summit of the fruit. Embryo _without endosperm_; the radicle\r\n_directed downwards_.\r\n\r\nOnly 1 Order: Compositæ.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the inflorescence and the development of the individual\r\nflowers, there is a very close resemblance to the Dipsacaceæ, which\r\nstand on the same plane of progression as the Compositæ. But while\r\nthe latter are allied to Campanulinæ as the last stage in the\r\nprocess of evolution, the Dipsacaceæ form the final stage of the\r\nRubiales-Dipsacales.\r\n\r\nOrder =Compositæ=. (For the principal characteristics compare those\r\nof the family.) The Compositæ are chiefly herbs, but trees and shrubs\r\nalso occur in tropical countries. The leaves may be scattered or\r\nopposite, but have no stipules. The outer leaves of the _involucre_\r\nas a rule are barren, especially when numerous and imbricate, while\r\nthe innermost ones support the ray-flowers of the capitulum; in a\r\nfew instances all are fertile (_e.g._ _Tragopogon_, _Tagetes_). The\r\nCAPITULA are many-flowered, with the exception, _e.g._ of _Echinops_,\r\nwhich has 1-flowered capitula (see page 570). The capitula are again\r\narranged in inflorescences, most frequently corymbose with centrifugal\r\norder of development. The _form of the receptacle_ is an important\r\ncharacter for the division of the genera (flat, convex, conical), and\r\nalso the _presence of scales_; these may be one scale (bract) for\r\neach flower (Fig. 610 _br_), or a large number of bristles, which\r\ndo not each correspond to a leaf, or the receptacle may be entirely\r\nwithout covering (_naked_). The flowers open in acropetal order in each\r\ncapitulum. All the flowers in a capitulum may be of the same _sex_, and\r\ntheir form and colour are in that case the same, or the sexes may be\r\ndifferent, in which case the form and colour are also most frequently\r\ndifferent: the ray-flowers have projecting labiate or ligulate\r\ncorollas, while the disc-flowers have tubular corollas. As a rule in\r\nthe latter case the ♀ flowers are at the circumference, and the ☿ in\r\nthe centre, less frequently ♀-flowers at the edge and ♂-flowers in the\r\ncentre. The ray-flowers in some genera are neuter (_e.g._ _Centaurea_).\r\nSome are diœcious.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 605.--_Calendula arvensis_: _A_ capitulum;\r\n  _B_ capitulum in longitudinal section; _C_ ♀-flower; _D_\r\n  ☿-flower; _E_ the stamens; _F_ capitulum with ripe fruits; _G_\r\n  ripe fruit.]\r\n\r\nThere is no trace of an epicalyx (in contrast to the Dipsacaceæ, which\r\nthey generally so resemble). The formation of the CALYX is very varied.\r\nThe calyx always consists of a very small cushion-like structure,\r\nmost frequently developed later than the corolla; the 5 corners,\r\nwhich correspond to the 5 sepals, in a few instances are raised as 5\r\nlarge, flat, membranous bodies, _e.g._ in species of _Xeranthemum_,\r\n_Catananche_, _Sphenogyne_, etc.; in other instances each of these\r\nbears a shorter or longer bristle on its apex, followed by others in\r\nrather uncertain numbers and with but slight indications of order, on\r\nthe edge and on the outer side of the calyx between the 5 points; in\r\nother instances, again, the calyx is covered with bristles and hairs\r\nwithout any indication of order or definite number (Fig. 606 _a_, _b_);\r\nfinally instances occur in which the edge is raised as a membranous\r\ncollar, irregularly toothed and notched, or divided into small\r\nscales. There are naturally differences in the means of distribution\r\ncorresponding to the differences in structure of the calyx. The fruits\r\n_a_ and _b_ represented in Fig. 606 are distributed by the wind, those\r\nlike _c_, on the other hand, by attaching themselves to animals and\r\nhuman beings. The rays of the pappus are termed _rough_ when special\r\ncells project a little beyond the surface, but if these grow out, and\r\nare hair-like, the pappus is said to be _feathery_. In some genera the\r\npappus is raised on a long stalk, which is developed from the upper\r\npart of the fruit, and termed a _beak_ (Fig. 606 _a_). The pappus does\r\nnot attain its full development till the ripening of the fruit, _i.e._\r\nuntil it is about to be of use.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 606.--_a_ Fruit of _Taraxacum_; _b_ of\r\n  _Senecio_; _c_ of _Bidens_.]\r\n\r\nThe COROLLA has various forms: (_a_) _tubular_ (Fig. 605 _D_), with\r\na shorter or longer tube, not always of the same bore throughout and\r\nespecially slightly widened at the top to form a bell-shaped opening,\r\nwith 5 _regular_ teeth: (_b_) _labiate_ after 2/3, _i.e._ with 2 petals\r\nin the upper and 3 in the under lip: (_c_) _ligulate_, _i.e._ the\r\ncorolla is split for a considerable distance on the posterior side (as\r\nin the Labiate genus _Teucrium_) and prolonged into a long, strap-like\r\nportion (Fig. 609 _A_), which projects upwards. A distinction must,\r\nhowever, be drawn between the true and false ligulate corolla. In the\r\nfirst case the corolla has 5 teeth at the apex (Fig. 609 _A_) and\r\nis made up of all the petals of the corolla united together; this is\r\nthe usual condition in the _Ligulate-flowered_. In the latter case\r\n(Fig. 605 _C_) the tongue has only 3 teeth (or is more irregularly\r\n2–3-dentate), and is only formed of 3 petals; the corolla is then truly\r\nbilabiate, the tongue is the large under lip, and the upper lip is very\r\nslightly developed, or even at an early stage quite suppressed. This\r\nfalse “ligulate” corolla is found among the _ray-flowers_; sometimes\r\nthe upper lip is seen quite plainly, _e.g._ in _Tagetes_, especially in\r\nthe double capitula. ~The VENATION of the corolla is peculiar; there\r\nare always commisural veins which branch dichotomously at the angles\r\nbetween the teeth of the corolla, and send a branch into the edge of\r\nthe two nearest teeth. The midrib is frequently absent, but may be\r\npresent, and then it has sometimes no connection with the other veins\r\nof the corolla.~\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 607.--_Centaurea cyanus_: _A_ the anther-tube\r\n  (_st_) with the crescentic curved filament before irritation;\r\n  _g_ the style; _k_ the base of the corolla; _B_ the same after\r\n  irritation, the anthers are drawn further down.]\r\n\r\nThe STAMENS are attached to the corolla, and have free filaments\r\n(_Silybum_ has united filaments), but the anthers, which at first are\r\nfree, adhere together and form a tube (Fig. 605 _E_: only _Ambrosieæ_\r\nhave free anthers). The _connective_ is generally prolonged, and\r\nprotrudes above the anthers as a thin, brown membrane of various forms\r\n(Fig. 605 _E_); appendages of various forms may also be found at the\r\nbase of the anthers. The anthers open introrsely, and the pollen must\r\nbe carried out at the top of the tube by upward growth of the style,\r\nand by means of the “stylar-brush” (Figs. 607, 608, 609); the filaments\r\nare sometimes sensitive (_e.g._ in the Corn-flower, Fig. 607), and\r\nshorten on being touched, so that the anther-tube is pulled downwards,\r\nand the pollen swept out at the top (Figs. 607, 608 _A_, _B_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 608.--_Cirsium arvense_: _A_ the upper\r\n  portion of a flower, the pollen (_e_) is being ejected; _B_ part\r\n  of the upper portion of the style with stylar-brush (_b_, _c_)\r\n  and the stigmatic papillæ (_d_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 609.--_Leontodon autumnale_: _A_ ligulate\r\n  flower; _B_ extremity of the style with stylar-brush (_a_),\r\n  stigma (_b_) and pollen-grains (_c_). _C_ _Centaurea cyanus_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 610.--_Achillea millefolium._]\r\n\r\nThe STYLE divides at the apex into two branches (Figs. 609, 610),\r\nboth of which generally bear on the inner surface two lines of\r\nstigmatic papillæ (Fig. 610 _B_, _C_) and being in shape, etc.,\r\nvery varied, are therefore employed as systematic characters.--~The\r\nmost important types are: =A.= The style is uniformly cylindrical;\r\nits branches are semi-cylindrical, long, and with long hairs, and\r\nfinally bend backwards; the stylar branches bear slightly projecting\r\nstigmatic papillæ on the inner side. This form is characteristic\r\nof the _Cichorieæ_ (Fig. 609 _A_ _B_). =B.= The style is uniformly\r\ncylindrical; the branches are long, cylindrical or club-like, short,\r\nnot rolled back, with fine hairs externally; the stigmatic lines do\r\nnot reach beyond the centre, and do not meet together. Characteristic\r\nof _Eupatorium_, _Petasites_, _Tussilago_. =C.= The style is thickened\r\nbeneath the stigmatic branches in the form of a knob, or very hairy\r\n(Fig. 609 _C_); the stigmatic lines reach as far as the apex of the\r\nbranches and then converge; sometimes the stigmatic branches are\r\nunited as far as the apex. Characteristic of the _Cynareæ_. =D.= The\r\nstylar branches are lanceolate, or linear, pointed; externally flat\r\nand thickly covered with hairs in the upper portion; the stigmatic\r\nlines cease where the hairs commence externally. Characteristic of\r\n_Aster_, _Bellis_, _Inula_, _Dahlia_, etc. =E.= The stylar branches are\r\nlinear, with long, brush-like hairs at the apex, where they are either\r\nabruptly cut off or prolonged into a very hairy, conical appendage;\r\nthe stigmatic lines are broad, _reach as far_ as the brush-like hairs,\r\nand do not meet together (Fig. 610). Characteristic of _Senecio_,\r\n_Helianthus_, _Xanthium_, _Gnaphalium_, _Artemisia_, _Anthemis_, and\r\nothers related to these.~\r\n\r\nA _ring-like nectary_ is found round the base of the style.\r\n\r\nThe thin-walled _cypsela_ (Fig. 606), with seeds fitting closely\r\nto the pericarp, has many different forms (smooth, ribbed, spined,\r\netc.); its point of attachment generally lies at the lowest end but\r\nsometimes it is drawn obliquely up the side (_Centaurea_, etc.).\r\nThe calyx, persistent on the apex of the fruit, has been described\r\nabove. Some genera have two or three different forms of fruits in\r\neach capitulum.--The embryo is straight, with the radicle _turned\r\ndownwards_, and _without endosperm_, but is rich in oil.\r\n\r\nThe variously flowered capitula, whose normal tubular disc-flowers have\r\nbeen changed to ligulate flowers, may be termed “double flowers.”\r\n\r\n   The relationship of the Compositæ to the Campanulinæ has been\r\n   described above (page 561). The alliance with the Dipsacaceæ\r\n   is more apparent than real. Similar capitate inflorescences\r\n   also occur as the final stage in other lines of descent, as in\r\n   _Eryngium_ among the _Umbelliferæ_.\r\n\r\n=1. Cynareæ, Thistle Group.= Flowers all ☿, regular, with _tubular_\r\ncorollas. The receptacle is covered with numerous _bristles_, which\r\nsurround the flowers without any definite order, or the edges of the\r\ngrooves in which these are placed have a well-marked fringe. The\r\ninvolucral leaves are numerous, imbricate, and are either prolonged\r\ninto a _thorn_ or terminate with a _membranous edge_. The style has\r\nbeen described on page 568 (Fig. 609 _C_). Nearly all have a hairy or\r\nfeathery pappus. The filaments are sensitive.\r\n\r\n_Carduus_ (Thistle); capitula ovoid; involucral leaves compact,\r\nimbricate, with thorny points; the pappus-rays are _hair-like_\r\nand united at the base by a ring (_i.e._ the calyx), and fall off\r\ntogether.--_Cirsium_ (Fig. 608) has a _feathery_ pappus, in other\r\nrespects it is like _Carduus_. ~_C. arvense_ reproduces and passes\r\nthe winter by means of suckers.~--_Cynara_ (Artichoke) has a feathery\r\npappus and large, _solitary_ capitulum, with broad involucral leaves;\r\nthese have a fleshy base like the receptacle (edible).--~_Silylum_\r\nhas united filaments. _S. marianum_ (Milk-thistle), has leaves with\r\nnumerous _white spots_. _Onopordon_ (Cotton-thistle). _Cnicus_ (_C.\r\nbenedictus_) has a large, many-spined thorn on the involucral leaves;\r\npappus trimorphic.~--_Lappa_ (Burdock) is easily recognized by the\r\n_hooked involucral leaves_, which assist in the distribution of the\r\nfruit; in this respect it differs from the other inflorescences,\r\nand also in the fact that the pappus is short, and quickly falls\r\noff, without serving as a means of distribution.--~_Carlina_; the\r\nexternal involucral leaves are _leafy_, _thorny_, with branched\r\nor unbranched spines standing straight out or bent backwards; the\r\n_internal ones are dry_, and prolonged as _dry_, _coloured_, radiating\r\n_scales_. The well-developed bristles on the receptacle and edge of\r\nthe calyx are _deeply cleft and lobed_.~--_Centaurea_ (Knap-weed,\r\nFig. 607). The ray-flowers are neuter, and generally larger than the\r\ndisc-flowers; the involucral leaves are regularly imbricate, but are\r\nfrequently provided at the apex with a dry, chaffy, often lobed,\r\nfringed appendage. The attachment of the fruit is lateral. _Serratula_\r\n(Saw-wort).--~_Carthamus_, the outer and inner involucral leaves\r\ndiffer very much.~--_Echinops_ (Globe-thistle) is characterised by\r\nhaving “compound capitula,” _i.e._ there is only one flower in each\r\ncapitulum, but many such capitula are collected into a spherical head,\r\nwhich at the base may also have a few involucral leaves. The individual\r\ncapitula have narrow, linear involucral leaves. ~(There are altogether\r\nabout 150 species of Compositæ with 1-flowered capitula, all from warm\r\ncountries.)~--_Xeranthemum_, _Staehelina_, _Jurinea_, _Saussurea_, etc.\r\n\r\n   =2. Mutisieæ, Labiate-flowered Group.= Tropical (S. American)\r\n   forms whose zygomorphic flowers have a bilabiate corolla (2/3).\r\n   The involucre is nearly the same as in the Thistles.\r\n\r\n=3. Cichorieæ, Chicory Group= (or LIGULIFLORÆ). The flowers are all\r\n☿ and have a _ligulate, 5-dentate_ corolla. The stylar branches are\r\nthin and prolonged (Fig. 609 _B_). _Laticiferous vessels_ occur\r\nin the majority (in this feature they resemble the Lobeliaceæ and\r\nCampanulaceæ).\r\n\r\n=A.= The pappus is _wanting_, or it is _scale-like_, but not long and\r\nhairy.--_Cichorium_ (Chicory); capitula with _blue flowers_, borne\r\nsingly or a few together in the leaf-axil; there are two whorls of\r\ninvolucral leaves, an outer one of short and radiating, an inner of\r\nmore numerous, longer and erect leaves; pappus, scale-like.--_Lapsana_\r\n(Nipplewort). The few involucral leaves are nearly of the same size,\r\nand persist forming a sort of capsule round the fruits, which are\r\nentirely without a pappus. There are only a few flowers in the small\r\ncapitula.--_Arnoseris_ (Swine’s-succory), _Catananche_, etc.\r\n\r\n=B.= The pappus is long and _hairy_ (not branched), generally fine\r\nand snowy-white. There are _no scales_ on the receptacle. The two\r\ngenera first considered have _beaked_ fruits.--_Taraxacum_ (Dandelion)\r\n(Fig. 606 _a_); the capitula are many-flowered, and borne singly\r\non the top of a leafless, hollow stalk.--_Lactuca_ (Lettuce) has\r\nmany small, few-flowered capitula borne in panicles.--_Crepis_\r\n(Hawksbeard).--_Hieracium_ (Hawk-weed) has many imbricate involucral\r\nleaves, and a stiff, brittle, brownish pappus.--_Sonchus_\r\n(Sow-thistle); the capitula, when a little old, have a broad base, and\r\nare abstricted above in the form of a jug; involucral leaves imbricate;\r\nthe fruit is compressed, without a beak, ridged. The soft, white pappus\r\nfalls off collectively.\r\n\r\n=C.= The pappus is _feathery_ and branched; no scales on the\r\nreceptacle.--_Tragopogon_ (Goat’s-beard) generally has 8 involucral\r\nleaves in one whorl. The fruit has a long beak; the rays of the pappus\r\nare interwoven in the form of an umbrella.--_Scorzonera_ has fruits\r\nlike the preceding, but almost without any beak; involucral leaves\r\nmany, imbricate.--_Leontodon_ (Hawkbit) has a slightly feathery pappus,\r\nrays not interwoven; beak absent.--_Picris._\r\n\r\n=D.= Long, chaff-like, deciduous scales on the receptacle; pappus\r\n_feathery_.--_Hypochœris_ (Cat’s-ear).\r\n\r\n=4. Eupatorieæ, Hemp-agrimony Group.= All the flowers are most\r\nfrequently ☿; corollas tubular and regular; the involucral leaves are\r\nnot stiff and spiny; the receptacle is not covered with stiff bristles.\r\nThe stylar branches are long, club-like, or gradually tapering. There\r\nis no swelling below the stigma.\r\n\r\n_Eupatorium_ (Hemp-agrimony); all the flowers are ☿.--_Petasites_\r\n(Butterbur); ray-flowers ♀, disc-flowers ☿ or ♂; sometimes diœcious.\r\nCapitula in racemes or panicles. The leaves develop after the\r\nflowering.--_Tussilago_ (_T. farfara_, Colt’s-foot) has a solitary\r\ncapitulum borne on a scaly, scape-like stem; the ray-flowers are ♀\r\nwith _ligulate_ corollas, disc-flowers ♂. The leaves unfold after the\r\nflowering. _Ageratum_, _Mikania_, _Vernonia_.\r\n\r\n=5. Astereæ, Aster Group= (or RADIATÆ, Ray-flowered). The flowers are\r\nof two forms and different sexes; the ray-flowers are ♀ (sometimes\r\nneuter), most frequently with irregular, _falsely ligulate_, radiating\r\ncorollas; the disc-flowers are ☿, regular, with tubular corollas (Fig.\r\n610). Sometimes only tubular flowers are present, as _e.g._ in _Senecio\r\nvulgaris_ (Groundsel), and the exterior of the capitulum is then as in\r\nthe Eupatorieæ. The stylar branches are straight, more or less flat and\r\nshort (Fig. 610).\r\n\r\n=A.= ANTHEMIDEÆ. Involucral leaves imbricate, generally membranous at\r\nthe edge; _pappus wanting_, or at most a _membranous margin_ to the\r\ncalyx, but without hairs.\r\n\r\n[+]. _Chaff-like bracts_ on the receptacle are found in _Anthemis_\r\n(Chamomile), _Anacyclus_ (_A. officinarum_), _Achillea_ (Milfoil, Fig.\r\n610), _Santolina_, etc.\r\n\r\n[++]. A _naked_ receptacle is found in the following: _Bellis_\r\n(Daisy) has solitary capitula on leafless stalks with white\r\nray-flowers.--_Matricaria_ (Wild Chamomile) has a conical receptacle.\r\n~(_M. chamomilla_ has a very high, hollow receptacle; _M.\r\ninodora_ has large, odourless capitula, and the receptacle is not\r\nhollow.)~--_Chrysanthemum_ (Ox-eye) most frequently large, solitary\r\ncapitula; flat receptacle.--_Pyrethrum_; pappus scanty.--With these are\r\nclassed _Tanacetum_ (Tansy) and _Artemisia_ (Wormwood) with tubular\r\ncorollas only.\r\n\r\n=B.= HELIANTHEÆ. Most frequently a bract to each flower is found on\r\nthe receptacle. The pappus is never exactly hairy, but consists of\r\nscales, spines, etc., and the fruits are most frequently compressed\r\n(Fig. 606 _c_).--_Helianthus_ (Sun-flower); _H. tuberosus_ (Jerusalem\r\nArtichoke) has tuberous underground stems. _Dahlia_ has tuberous roots\r\n(Am.). _Bidens_ (Bur-marigold, Fig. 606 _c_); the fruits are compressed\r\nwith 2 (or more) spines provided with reflexed barbs.--_Calliopsis_;\r\n_Rudbeckia_; _Zinnia_; _Tagetes_ has united involucral leaves,\r\nand yellow, transparent oil-glands. _Spilanthes_, _Galinsoga_,\r\n_Melampodium_, _Silphium_ (Compass-plant), _Helenium_, _Gaillardia_.\r\n\r\n=C.= CALENDULEÆ have 1–2 rows of involucral leaves, a naked receptacle,\r\nand large, crescent-shaped, irregularly warted fruits, of different\r\nforms in the same capitulum; pappus absent (Fig. 605).--_Calendula_\r\n(Marigold); ray-flowers ♀, disc-flowers ♂.\r\n\r\n=D.= SENECIONEÆ, have a fine, _hairy_, white pappus; no bracts,\r\notherwise as in Anthemideæ. The involucral leaves are most frequently\r\nin 1–2 rows.--_Senecio_ (Groundsel) has two whorls of involucral\r\nleaves, which most frequently have black tips, the external being much\r\nshorter than the internal ones (_S. vulgaris_ has all flowers ☿ and\r\nalike).--_Cacalia_, _Doronicum_, _Cineraria_, _Ligularia_, _Arnica_\r\n(_A. montana_; large, long-stalked capitula; leaves opposite, forming a\r\nkind of rosette).\r\n\r\n=E.= ASTEREÆ have a bristle-like, unbranched pappus, often\r\nof a dingy brown; receptacle naked; involucral leaves\r\nnumerous, imbricate.--_Solidago_ (Golden-rod); capitula small,\r\nyellow-flowered, borne in panicles. _Aster_; disc-flowers most\r\nfrequently yellow, ray-flowers violet; _Callistephus_; _Erigeron_\r\n(Flea-bane)--_Inula_.--All the corollas are tubular in: _Gnaphalium_\r\n(Cud-weed); involucral leaves dry, rattling, often coloured; the\r\nfoliage-leaves and stem often white with woolly hairs; ray-flowers\r\n♀, with narrow, tubular corolla; disc-flowers ☿ (few). _Antennaria_\r\n(Cat’s-foot; diœcious), _Filago_, _Helichrysum_, _Ammobium_,\r\n_Rhodanthe_ and others. _Leontopodium_ (_L. alpinum_, “Edelweiss”).\r\n\r\n   =F.= AMBROSIEÆ, a very reduced type of Compositæ, differing from\r\n   the others in having _free anthers_; the capitula are generally\r\n   unisexual, monœcious, the ♂ borne in a terminal inflorescence,\r\n   the ♀ in the leaf-axils. In other respects they are most closely\r\n   related to _Heliantheæ_.--_Xanthium._ In the ♂-capitula there\r\n   are many flowers without calyx, but with tubular corolla and\r\n   free involucral leaves. In the ♀-capitula there are only 2\r\n   flowers, which are entirely destitute of both calyx and corolla;\r\n   involucral leaves 2-spined, united to form an ovoid, bilocular\r\n   envelope, each compartment containing one flower. The envelope\r\n   of involucral leaves unites with the fruits, enclosing them at\r\n   maturity with a hard covering from which numerous hook-like\r\n   spines project, assisting very greatly in the distribution of\r\n   the fruit. The whole structure thus finally becomes a 1- or\r\n   2-seeded _false_ nut.--_Ambrosia_, the ♀ capitulum 1-flowered.\r\n\r\n   POLLINATION. The flowers are somewhat insignificant, but become\r\n   very conspicuous owing to a number being crowded together in\r\n   one inflorescence. The corollas of the ray-flowers, being\r\n   often very large (_Astereæ_; _Centaurea_), frequently render\r\n   the capitula still more conspicuous. The capitula display\r\n   many biological phenomena similar to those often shown by the\r\n   individual flowers in other orders, e.g. by periodically opening\r\n   and closing, in which the involucral leaves resemble the calyx\r\n   in their action. (The name “Compositæ” originates from the term\r\n   “flos compositus,” composite flower). An abundance of honey is\r\n   formed, which to some extent fills up the corolla-tube, and\r\n   since insects may visit a number of flowers in the course of a\r\n   short period they are very frequently visited, especially by\r\n   butterflies and bees. The pollination has been described on page\r\n   567. Protandry is universal. In the bud the tips of the styles,\r\n   covered by the sweeping-hairs, lie closely enveloped by the\r\n   anther-tube; in the next stage the style grows through the tube\r\n   and sweeps out the pollen as it proceeds; ultimately the stylar\r\n   branches expand and the stigma is then prepared to receive the\r\n   pollen. In many, the sensitiveness of the filaments assists in\r\n   sweeping out the pollen at the exact moment of the insect visit.\r\n   Regular self-pollination is found _e.g._ in _Senecio vulgaris_;\r\n   wind-pollination _e.g._ in _Artemisia_ and the plants related to\r\n   it.\r\n\r\n   This extremely natural and well-defined order is the largest\r\n   (and no doubt one of the youngest?); it embraces 10–12,000\r\n   known species (in 770 genera), or about one-tenth of all\r\n   Flowering-plants. They are distributed over the whole globe, but\r\n   are most numerous in temperate countries; the majority prefer\r\n   open spaces; a smaller number are forest-forms. They abound\r\n   especially in open districts in America.\r\n\r\n   Among the substances frequently found may be mentioned: INULIN\r\n   (especially in the subterranean parts), BITTER materials,\r\n   Tannin, volatile oils, fatty oils in the fruits.

C. POTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest systems of classification were derived from the properties\r\nand uses of plants; and it was not until some two centuries ago\r\nthat any scientific grouping of plants was attempted. Aristotle and\r\nTheophrastus had adopted the groups of Trees, Shrubs and Herbs as the\r\nchief divisions of the Vegetable Kingdom, a system which persisted\r\nand was employed by Tournefort and Ray as late as the end of the 17th\r\ncentury. The arrangement by which these three divisions were separated\r\ninto smaller divisions was often founded upon a single character, such\r\nas the formation of the corolla, the form of fruit, that of the calyx\r\nand corolla, etc. All these systems of classification which brought\r\ninto close proximity plants distinguished by some one character alone,\r\ncould only be considered as _artificial_, since plants related to one\r\nanother would not necessarily be included in the same group. As the\r\nknowledge of the morphology, physiology, and reproduction of plants\r\nincreased, such systems were recognised as unscientific, and it became\r\nthe aim of botanists to establish a _natural_ system, founded upon\r\nmutual relationships, which would associate together _only_ those\r\nplants which are truly allied.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the chief systems of classification which\r\nwill show the gradual development of the natural system, and may be of\r\nservice to students making use of this text-book.[41]\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem of JOHN RAY (1703).\r\n\r\n     I.

(Nitrifying-bacteria) can build organic from inorganic\r\nmatter. Sachs’ hypothesis that the first organisms must necessarily\r\nhave contained chlorophyll is therefore untenable.\r\n\r\n[3] Myxogasteres, Engler’s Syllabus, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[4] Acrasieæ and Plasmodiophorales, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[5] Myxophyceæ, Cyanophyceæ.\r\n\r\n[6] The Bacteria are more usually included under Fungi. It seems\r\nbetter, however, to place them under the Algæ in a separate class with\r\nthe Schizophyceæ.\r\n\r\n[7] See Marshall Ward, “On the Characters or Marks employed for\r\nClassifying the Schizomycetes,” _Annals of Botany_, 1892.\r\n\r\n[8] According to Hansen these are not disease forms, but occur\r\nregularly under certain conditions, _e.g._ temperature.\r\n\r\n[9] Before fertilisation the oosphere divides and cuts off at the base\r\none or more cells (polar bodies?), termed “wendungszellen.”\r\n\r\n[10] From the Greek μὐκης = Fungus, hence “mycology.”\r\n\r\n[11] This term is adopted as a translation of the German “anlage.”\r\n\r\n[12] Also termed Water-Fungi (Wasserpilzen).\r\n\r\n[13] Antheridium is preferred in this sub-class as keeping a more\r\nuniform term (Kn).\r\n\r\n[14] In the _resupinate_ fruit-bodies a fertile and sterile\r\nsurface cannot be distinguished (_cf._ Polyporaceæ and some\r\n_Stereum_-species).\r\n\r\n[15] The two last genera are identical, the Algal part being a\r\n_Scytonema_, that of _Cora_ a _Chroococcus_; while the same Fungus--a\r\n_Thelephora_--takes part in the formation of all three (A. Möller,\r\nFlora, 1893).\r\n\r\n[16] Formerly termed _oophyte_.\r\n\r\n[17] The oospore divides by a wall transverse or oblique to the longer\r\naxis of the archegonium. From the upper (epibasal) cell, the capsule\r\n(and seta) is derived, while the lower (hypobasal) gives rise to the\r\n_foot_. In _Riccia_ the hypobasal half takes part in the\r\nformation of the sporangium.\r\n\r\n[18] In the Polypodiaceæ unisexual prothallia as distinct as those of\r\n_Equisetum_ are of common occurrence.\r\n\r\n[19] The position of the annulus varies in the different orders;\r\nlongitudinal in Polypodiaceæ, Hymenophyllaceæ, and Cyatheaceæ;\r\ntransverse in Schizæaceæ, Gleicheniaceæ; indistinct or apical in\r\nOsmundaceæ, Ophioglossaceæ, Marattiaceæ, Salviniaceæ, Marsiliaceæ.\r\n\r\n[20] The former genus _Pteris_ is divided into _Pteris_ and\r\n_Pteridium_.\r\n\r\n[21] Floral-leaves (hypsophyllary leaves) are here adopted as an\r\nequivalent of the term “Hochblätter,” to signify leaves on the\r\nfloral-shoot other than foliage or sporangia-bearing leaves. The\r\nterm _bract_ is applied only to leaves in whose axil a flower\r\nis borne, and _bracteoles_ to leaves borne on the flower-stalk\r\n(_pedicel_).\r\n\r\n[22] It may be here remarked that another explanation is possible,\r\nbased on the study of the development (_K_).\r\n\r\n[23] Piperaceæ, Nymphæaceæ.\r\n\r\n[24] “Fore-leaf” is adopted as a translation of “Vorblatt.”\r\n\r\n[25] Regarding these and other abbreviations see the appendix in the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n[26] Syncarp = cluster of fruits belonging to one flower.\r\n\r\n[27] “Fan” and “sickle” are adopted as terms for these inflorescences\r\nfrom the German “_fæchel_” and “_sichel_.”\r\n\r\n[28] [Although unbranched stems are characteristic of the Palms, yet\r\nbranched specimens are recorded from some eleven genera. The branches\r\nare developed from lateral buds, which in many instances only develope\r\nwhen the terminal bud has been destroyed. A few Palms develope axillary\r\nbranches at the base of the stem; these form rhizomes, and give rise to\r\nclusters of aerial stems.]\r\n\r\n[29] The aggregation of the fruits of several distinct flowers into one\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n[30] According to Pfitzer, the column is the prolongation of the floral\r\naxis beyond the insertion of the perianth, and is not formed by the\r\ncoalescence of sporophylls (filament and style).\r\n\r\n[31] _Cypripedilum_ = _Cypripedium_.\r\n\r\n[32] _Corallorhiza_ = _Coralliorrhiza_.\r\n\r\n[33] This is Eichler’s view.--According to Drude the perianth is\r\nabsent; at the base of the bracts, a nectary or cup-like disc. Prantl\r\nholds the same view. According to Pax the perianth is absent, but there\r\nis a disc cup-like, or reduced to a single toothed scale.\r\n\r\n[34] The fruit of the Walnut is thus a false fruit; and the term drupe\r\nmust therefore not be used in the same sense as in the Rosaceæ.\r\n\r\n[35] The pollen-tube in _Ulmus_ does not enter the ovule through\r\nthe micropyle.\r\n\r\n[36] According to Prantl, some species of _Trollius_ (_T.\r\neuropæus_, and _asiatiacus_) have a perianth, differentiated\r\ninto calyx and corolla, which does not pass over into the honey-leaves.\r\nThe outer leaves of the perianth have frequently an incised apex, the\r\nintermediate ones sometimes present transitional forms to the inner,\r\nand sometimes there is a distinct boundary between them.\r\n\r\n[37] If we suppose a spiral line drawn through the leaves\r\n_upwards_ on a stem with scattered leaves (in the shortest way),\r\nthen the side of the leaf first touched is the catodic, or descending,\r\nand the other the anodic, or ascending side.\r\n\r\n[38] Those marked [+] are officinal, and when no home is stated, the\r\nplant is a native.\r\n\r\n[39] Those which are officinal are indicated by [+].\r\n\r\n[40] Those marked with a [+] are officinal.\r\n\r\n[41] For further reference see Sachs, _History of Botany_;\r\nLindley, _Vegetable Kingdom_; Le Maout and Decaisne, _General\r\nSystem of Botany_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n1.
