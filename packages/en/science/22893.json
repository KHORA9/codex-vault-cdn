He gestured at the tall\r\nbanks of buildings that loomed around Central Park, with their countless\r\nwindows glowing like the cave fires of a city of Cro-Magnon people. \"All\r\nis dream, all is illusion; I am your vision as you are mine.\"\r\n\r\nDan Burke, struggling for clarity of thought through the fumes of\r\nliquor, stared without comprehension at the tiny figure of his\r\ncompanion. He began to regret the impulse that had driven him to leave\r\nthe party to seek fresh air in the park, and to fall by chance into the\r\ncompany of this diminutive old madman. But he had needed escape; this\r\nwas one party too many, and not even the presence of Claire with her\r\ntrim ankles could hold him there. He felt an angry desire to go\r\nhome--not to his hotel, but home to Chicago and to the comparative peace\r\nof the Board of Trade. But he was leaving tomorrow anyway.\r\n\r\n\"You drink,\" said the elfin, bearded face, \"to make real a dream. Is it\r\nnot so? Either to dream that what you seek is yours, or else to dream\r\nthat what you hate is conquered. You drink to escape reality, and the\r\nirony is that even reality is a dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cracked!\" thought Dan again.\r\n\r\n\"Or so,\" concluded the other, \"says the philosopher Berkeley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Berkeley?\" echoed Dan. His head was clearing; memories of a Sophomore\r\ncourse in Elementary Philosophy drifted back. \"Bishop Berkeley, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know him, then? The philosopher of Idealism--no?--the one who\r\nargues that we do not see, feel, hear, taste the object, but that we\r\nhave only the sensation of seeing, feeling, hearing, tasting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--sort of recall it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! But sensations are _mental_ phenomena. They exist in our minds.\r\nHow, then, do we know that the objects themselves do not exist only in\r\nour minds?\" He waved again at the light-flecked buildings. \"You do not\r\nsee that wall of masonry; you perceive only a _sensation_, a feeling of\r\nsight. The rest you interpret.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see the same thing,\" retorted Dan.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know I do? Even if you knew that what I call red would not\r\nbe green could you see through my eyes--even if you knew that, how do\r\nyou know that I too am not a dream of yours?\"\r\n\r\nDan laughed. \"Of course nobody _knows_ anything. You just get what\r\ninformation you can through the windows of your five senses, and then\r\nmake your guesses. When they're wrong, you pay the penalty.\" His mind\r\nwas clear now save for a mild headache. \"Listen,\" he said suddenly. \"You\r\ncan argue a reality away to an illusion; that's easy. But if your friend\r\nBerkeley is right, why can't you take a dream and make it real? If it\r\nworks one way, it must work the other.\"\r\n\r\nThe beard waggled; elf-bright eyes glittered queerly at him. \"All\r\nartists do that,\" said the old man softly. Dan felt that something more\r\nquivered on the verge of utterance.\r\n\r\n\"That's an evasion,\" he grunted. \"Anybody can tell the difference\r\nbetween a picture and the real thing, or between a movie and life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" whispered the other, \"the realer the better, no? And if one could\r\nmake a--a movie--_very_ real indeed, what would you say then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody can, though.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes glittered strangely again. \"I can!\" he whispered. \"I _did_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Made real a dream.\" The voice turned angry. \"Fools! I bring it here to\r\nsell to Westman, the camera people, and what do they say? 'It isn't\r\nclear. Only one person can use it at a time. It's too expensive.' Fools!\r\nFools!\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen! I'm Albert Ludwig--_Professor_ Ludwig.\" As Dan was silent, he\r\ncontinued, \"It means nothing to you, eh? But listen--a movie that gives\r\none sight and sound. Suppose now I add taste, smell, even touch, if your\r\ninterest is taken by the story. Suppose I make it so that you are in the\r\nstory, you speak to the shadows, and the shadows reply, and instead of\r\nbeing on a screen, the story is all about you, and you are in it. Would\r\nthat be to make real a dream?\"\r\n\r\n\"How the devil could you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"How? How? But simply! First my liquid positive, then my magic\r\nspectacles. I photograph the story in a liquid with light-sensitive\r\nchromates. I build up a complex solution--do you see? I add taste\r\nchemically and sound electrically. And when the story is recorded, then\r\nI put the solution in my spectacle--my movie projector. I electrolyze\r\nthe solution, break it down; the older chromates go first, and out comes\r\nthe story, sight, sound, smell, taste--all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Touch?\"\r\n\r\n\"If your interest is taken, your mind supplies that.\" Eagerness crept\r\ninto his voice. \"You will look at it, Mr.----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Burke,\" said Dan. \"A swindle!\" he thought. Then a spark of recklessness\r\nglowed out of the vanishing fumes of alcohol. \"Why not?\" he grunted.\r\n\r\nHe rose; Ludwig, standing, came scarcely to his shoulder. A queer\r\ngnomelike old man, Dan thought as he followed him across the park and\r\ninto one of the scores of apartment hotels in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn his room Ludwig fumbled in a bag, producing a device vaguely\r\nreminiscent of a gas mask. There were goggles and a rubber mouthpiece;\r\nDan examined it curiously, while the little bearded professor brandished\r\na bottle of watery liquid.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is!\" he gloated. \"My liquid positive, the story. Hard\r\nphotography--infernally hard, therefore the simplest story. A\r\nUtopia--just two characters and you, the audience. Now, put the\r\nspectacles on. Put them on and tell me what fools the Westman people\r\nare!\" He decanted some of the liquid into the mask, and trailed a\r\ntwisted wire to a device on the table. \"A rectifier,\" he explained. \"For\r\nthe electrolysis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must you use all the liquid?\" asked Dan. \"If you use part, do you see\r\nonly part of the story? And which part?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every drop has all of it, but you must fill the eye-pieces.\" Then as\r\nDan slipped the device gingerly on, \"So! Now what do you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a damn' thing. Just the windows and the lights across the street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. But now I start the electrolysis. Now!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of chaos. The liquid before Dan's eyes clouded\r\nsuddenly white, and formless sounds buzzed. He moved to tear the device\r\nfrom his head, but emerging forms in the mistiness caught his interest.\r\nGiant things were writhing there.\r\n\r\nThe scene steadied; the whiteness was dissipating like mist in summer.\r\nUnbelieving, still gripping the arms of that unseen chair, he was\r\nstaring at a forest. But what a forest! Incredible, unearthly,\r\nbeautiful! Smooth boles ascended inconceivably toward a brightening sky,\r\ntrees bizarre as the forests of the Carboniferous age. Infinitely\r\noverhead swayed misty fronds, and the verdure showed brown and green in\r\nthe heights. And there were birds--at least, curiously lovely pipings\r\nand twitterings were all about him though he saw no creatures--thin\r\nelfin whistlings like fairy bugles sounded softly.\r\n\r\nHe sat frozen, entranced. A louder fragment of melody drifted down to\r\nhim, mounting in exquisite, ecstatic bursts, now clear as sounding\r\nmetal, now soft as remembered music. For a moment he forgot the chair\r\nwhose arms he gripped, the miserable hotel room invisibly about him, old\r\nLudwig, his aching head. He imagined himself alone in the midst of that\r\nlovely glade. \"Eden!\" he muttered, and the swelling music of unseen\r\nvoices answered.\r\n\r\nSome measure of reason returned. \"Illusion!\" he told himself. Clever\r\noptical devices, not reality. He groped for the chair's arm, found it,\r\nand clung to it; he scraped his feet and found again an inconsistency.\r\nTo his eyes the ground was mossy verdure; to his touch it was merely a\r\nthin hotel carpet.\r\n\r\nThe elfin buglings sounded gently. A faint, deliciously sweet perfume\r\nbreathed against him; he glanced up to watch the opening of a great\r\ncrimson blossom on the nearest tree, and a tiny reddish sun edged into\r\nthe circle of sky above him. The fairy orchestra swelled louder in its\r\nlight, and the notes sent a thrill of wistfulness through him. Illusion?\r\nIf it were, it made reality almost unbearable; he wanted to believe that\r\nsomewhere--somewhere this side of dreams, there actually existed this\r\nregion of loveliness. An outpost of Paradise? Perhaps.\r\n\r\nAnd then--far through the softening mists, he caught a movement that was\r\nnot the swaying of verdure, a shimmer of silver more solid than mist.\r\nSomething approached. He watched the figure as it moved, now visible,\r\nnow hidden by trees; very soon he perceived that it was human, but it\r\nwas almost upon him before he realized that it was a girl.\r\n\r\nShe wore a robe of silvery, half-translucent stuff, luminous as\r\nstarbeams; a thin band of silver bound glowing black hair about her\r\nforehead, and other garment or ornament she had none. Her tiny white\r\nfeet were bare to the mossy forest floor as she stood no more than a\r\npace from him, staring dark-eyed. The thin music sounded again; she\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nDan summoned stumbling thoughts. Was this being also--illusion? Had she\r\nno more reality than the loveliness of the forest? He opened his lips to\r\nspeak, but a strained excited voice sounded in his ears. \"Who are you?\"\r\nHad he spoken? The voice had come as if from another, like the sound of\r\none's words in fever.\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled again. \"English!\" she said in queer soft tones. \"I can\r\nspeak a little English.\" She spoke slowly, carefully. \"I learned it\r\nfrom\"--she hesitated--\"my mother's father, whom they call the Grey\r\nWeaver.\"\r\n\r\nAgain came the voice in Dan's ears. \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am called Galatea,\" she said. \"I came to find you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To find me?\" echoed the voice that was Dan's.\r\n\r\n\"Leucon, who is called the Grey Weaver, told me,\" she explained smiling.\r\n\"He said you will stay with us until the second noon from this.\" She\r\ncast a quick slanting glance at the pale sun now full above the\r\nclearing, then stepped closer. \"What are you called?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dan,\" he muttered. His voice sounded oddly different.\r\n\r\n\"What a strange name!\" said the girl. She stretched out her bare arm.\r\n\"Come,\" she smiled.\r\n\r\nDan touched her extended hand, feeling without any surprise the living\r\nwarmth of her fingers. He had forgotten the paradoxes of illusion; this\r\nwas no longer illusion to him, but reality itself. It seemed to him that\r\nhe followed her, walking over the shadowed turf that gave with springy\r\ncrunch beneath his tread, though Galatea left hardly an imprint. He\r\nglanced down, noting that he himself wore a silver garment, and that his\r\nfeet were bare; with the glance he felt a feathery breeze on his body\r\nand a sense of mossy earth on his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Galatea,\" said his voice. \"Galatea, what place is this? What language\r\ndo you speak?\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced back laughing. \"Why, this is Paracosma, of course, and this\r\nis our language.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paracosma,\" muttered Dan. \"Para--cosma!\" A fragment of Greek that had\r\nsurvived somehow from a Sophomore course a decade in the past came\r\nstrangely back to him. Paracosma! Land-beyond-the-world!\r\n\r\nGalatea cast a smiling glance at him. \"Does the real world seem\r\nstrange,\" she queried, \"after that shadow land of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shadow land?\" echoed Dan, bewildered. \"_This_ is shadow, not my world.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's smile turned quizzical. \"Poof!\" she retorted with an\r\nimpudently lovely pout. \"And I suppose, then, that _I_ am the phantom\r\ninstead of you!\" She laughed. \"Do I seem ghostlike?\"\r\n\r\nDan made no reply; he was puzzling over unanswerable questions as he\r\ntrod behind the lithe figure of his guide. The aisle between the\r\nunearthly trees widened, and the giants were fewer. It seemed a mile,\r\nperhaps, before a sound of tinkling water obscured that other strange\r\nmusic; they emerged on the bank of a little river, swift and\r\ncrystalline, that rippled and gurgled its way from glowing pool to\r\nflashing rapids, sparkling under the pale sun. Galatea bent over the\r\nbrink and cupped her hands, raising a few mouthfuls of water to her\r\nlips; Dan followed her example, finding the liquid stinging cold.\r\n\r\n\"How do we cross?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You can wade up there,\"--the dryad who led him gestured to a sun-lit\r\nshallows above a tiny falls--\"but I always cross here.\" She poised\r\nherself for a moment on the green bank, then dove like a silver arrow\r\ninto the pool. Dan followed; the water stung his body like champagne,\r\nbut a stroke or two carried him across to where Galatea had already\r\nemerged with a glistening of creamy bare limbs. Her garment clung tight\r\nas a metal sheath to her wet body; he felt a breath-taking thrill at the\r\nsight of her. And then, miraculously, the silver cloth was dry, the\r\ndroplets rolled off as if from oiled silk, and they moved briskly on.\r\n\r\nThe incredible forest had ended with the river; they walked over a\r\nmeadow studded with little, many-hued, star-shaped flowers, whose fronds\r\nunderfoot were soft as a lawn. Yet still the sweet pipings followed\r\nthem, now loud, now whisper-soft, in a tenuous web of melody.\r\n\r\n\"Galatea!\" said Dan suddenly. \"Where is the music coming from?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked back amazed. \"You silly one!\" she laughed. \"From the flowers,\r\nof course. See!\" she plucked a purple star and held it to his ear; true\r\nenough, a faint and plaintive melody hummed out of the blossom. She\r\ntossed it in his startled face and skipped on.\r\n\r\nA little copse appeared ahead, not of the gigantic forest trees, but of\r\nlesser growths, bearing flowers and fruits of iridescent colors, and a\r\ntiny brook bubbled through. And there stood the objective of their\r\njourney--a building of white, marble-like stone, single-storied and vine\r\ncovered, with broad glassless windows. They trod upon a path of bright\r\npebbles to the arched entrance, and here, on an intricate stone bench,\r\nsat a grey-bearded patriarchal individual. Galatea addressed him in a\r\nliquid language that reminded Dan of the flower-pipings; then she\r\nturned. \"This is Leucon,\" she said, as the ancient rose from his seat\r\nand spoke in English.\r\n\r\n\"We are happy, Galatea and I, to welcome you, since visitors are a rare\r\npleasure here, and those from your shadowy country most rare.\"\r\n\r\nDan uttered puzzled words of thanks, and the old man nodded, reseating\r\nhimself on the carven bench; Galatea skipped through the arched\r\nentrance, and Dan, after an irresolute moment, dropped to the remaining\r\nbench. Once more his thoughts were whirling in perplexed turbulence. Was\r\nall this indeed but illusion? Was he sitting, in actuality, in a prosaic\r\nhotel room, peering through magic spectacles that pictured this world\r\nabout him, or was he, transported by some miracle, really sitting here\r\nin this land of loveliness? He touched the bench; stone, hard and\r\nunyielding, met his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Leucon,\" said his voice, \"how did you know I was coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was told,\" said the other.\r\n\r\n\"By whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--_someone_ must have told you!\"\r\n\r\nThe Grey Weaver shook his solemn head. \"I was just told.\"\r\n\r\nDan ceased his questioning, content for the moment to drink in the\r\nbeauty about him and then Galatea returned bearing a crystal bowl of the\r\nstrange fruits. They were piled in colorful disorder, red, purple,\r\norange and yellow, pear-shaped, egg-shaped, and clustered\r\nspheroids--fantastic, unearthly. He selected a pale, transparent ovoid,\r\nbit into it, and was deluged by a flood of sweet liquid, to the\r\namusement of the girl. She laughed and chose a similar morsel; biting a\r\ntiny puncture in the end, she squeezed the contents into her mouth. Dan\r\ntook a different sort, purple and tart as Rhenish wine, and then\r\nanother, filled with edible, almond-like seeds. Galatea laughed\r\ndelightedly at his surprises, and even Leucon smiled a grey smile.\r\nFinally Dan tossed the last husk into the brook beside them, where it\r\ndanced briskly toward the river.\r\n\r\n\"Galatea,\" he said, \"do you ever go to a city? What cities are in\r\nParacosma?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cities? What are cities?\"\r\n\r\n\"Places where many people live close together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the girl frowning. \"No. There are no cities here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then where are the people of Paracosma? You must have neighbors.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl looked puzzled. \"A man and a woman live off there,\" she said,\r\ngesturing toward a distant blue range of hills dim on the horizon. \"Far\r\naway over there. I went there once, but Leucon and I prefer the valley.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Galatea!\" protested Dan. \"Are you and Leucon alone in this valley?\r\nWhere--what happened to your parents--your father and mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"They went away. That way--toward the sunrise. They'll return some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if they don't?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, foolish one! What could hinder them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wild beasts,\" said Dan. \"Poisonous insects, disease, flood, storm,\r\nlawless people, death!\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard those words,\" said Galatea. \"There are no such things\r\nhere.\" She sniffed contemptuously. \"Lawless people!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not--death?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is death?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's--\" Dan paused helplessly. \"It's like falling asleep and never\r\nwaking. It's what happens to everyone at the end of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of such a thing as the end of life!\" said the girl\r\ndecidedly. \"There isn't such a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happens, then,\" queried Dan desperately, \"when one grows old?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, silly! No one grows old unless he wants to, like Leucon. A\r\nperson grows to the age he likes best and then stops. It's a law!\"\r\n\r\nDan gathered his chaotic thoughts. He stared into Galatea's dark, lovely\r\neyes. \"Have you stopped yet?\"\r\n\r\nThe dark eyes dropped; he was amazed to see a deep, embarrassed flush\r\nspread over her cheeks. She looked at Leucon nodding reflectively on his\r\nbench, then back to Dan, meeting his gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And when will you, Galatea?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I have had the one child permitted me. You see\"--she stared down\r\nat her dainty toes--\"one cannot--bear children--afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permitted? Permitted by whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"By a law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laws! Is everything here governed by laws? What of chance and\r\naccidents?\"\r\n\r\n\"What are those--chance and accidents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Things unexpected--things unforeseen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is unforeseen,\" said Galatea, still soberly. She repeated\r\nslowly, \"Nothing is unforeseen.\" He fancied her voice was wistful.\r\n\r\nLeucon looked up. \"Enough of this,\" he said abruptly. He turned to Dan,\r\n\"I know these words of yours--chance, disease, death. They are not for\r\nParacosma. Keep them in your unreal country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you hear them, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Galatea's mother,\" said the Grey Weaver, \"who had them from your\r\npredecessor--a phantom who visited here before Galatea was born.\"\r\n\r\nDan had a vision of Ludwig's face. \"What was he like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But his name?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's mouth was suddenly grim. \"We do not speak of him,\" he said\r\nand rose, entering the dwelling in cold silence.\r\n\r\n\"He goes to weave,\" said Galatea after a moment. Her lovely, piquant\r\nface was still troubled.\r\n\r\n\"What does he weave?\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" She fingered the silver cloth of her gown. \"He weaves it out of\r\nmetal bars on a very clever machine. I do not know the method.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who made the machine?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--Galatea! Who built the house? Who planted these fruit trees?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were here. The house and trees were always here.\" She lifted her\r\neyes. \"I told you everything had been foreseen, from the beginning until\r\neternity--everything. The house and trees and machine were ready for\r\nLeucon and my parents and me. There is a place for my child, who will be\r\na girl, and a place for her child--and so on forever.\"\r\n\r\nDan thought a moment. \"Were you born here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\" He noted in sudden concern that her eyes were glistening\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\n\"Galatea, dear! Why are you unhappy? What's wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, nothing!\" She shook her black curls, smiled suddenly at him. \"What\r\ncould be wrong? How can one be unhappy in Paracosma?\" She sprang erect\r\nand seized his hand. \"Come! Let's gather fruit for tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe darted off in a whirl of flashing silver, and Dan followed her\r\naround the wing of the edifice. Graceful as a dancer she leaped for a\r\nbranch above her head, caught it laughingly, and tossed a great golden\r\nglobe to him. She loaded his arms with the bright prizes and sent him\r\nback to the bench, and when he returned, she piled it so full of fruit\r\nthat a deluge of colorful spheres dropped around him. She laughed again,\r\nand sent them spinning into the brook with thrusts of her rosy toes,\r\nwhile Dan watched her with an aching wistfulness. Then suddenly she was\r\nfacing him; for a long, tense instant they stood motionless, eyes upon\r\neyes, and then she turned away and walked slowly around to the arched\r\nportal. He followed her with his burden of fruit; his mind was once more\r\nin a turmoil of doubt and perplexity.\r\n\r\nThe little sun was losing itself behind the trees of that colossal\r\nforest to the west, and a coolness stirred among long shadows. The brook\r\nwas purple-hued in the dusk, but its cheery notes mingled still with the\r\nflower music. Then the sun was hidden; the shadow fingers darkened the\r\nmeadow; of a sudden the flowers were still, and the brook gurgled alone\r\nin a world of silence. In silence too, Dan entered the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe chamber within was a spacious one, floored with large black and\r\nwhite squares; exquisite benches of carved marble were here and there.\r\nOld Leucon, in a far corner, bent over an intricate, glistening\r\nmechanism, and as Dan entered he drew a shining length of silver cloth\r\nfrom it, folded it, and placed it carefully aside. There was a curious,\r\nunearthly fact that Dan noted; despite windows open to the evening, no\r\nnight insects circled the globes that glowed at intervals from niches in\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\nGalatea stood in a doorway to his left, leaning half-wearily against the\r\nframe; he placed the bowl of fruit on a bench at the entrance and moved\r\nto her side.\r\n\r\n\"This is yours,\" she said, indicating the room beyond. He looked in upon\r\na pleasant, smaller chamber; a window framed a starry square, and a\r\nthin, swift, nearly silent stream of water gushed from the mouth of a\r\ncarved human head on the left wall, curving into a six-foot basin sunk\r\nin the floor. Another of the graceful benches covered with the silver\r\ncloth completed the furnishings; a single glowing sphere, pendant by a\r\nchain from the ceiling, illuminated the room. Dan turned to the girl,\r\nwhose eyes were still unwontedly serious.\r\n\r\n\"This is ideal,\" he said, \"but, Galatea, how am I to turn out the\r\nlight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn it out?\" she said. \"You must cap it--so!\" A faint smile showed\r\nagain on her lips as she dropped a metal covering over the shining\r\nsphere. They stood tense in the darkness; Dan sensed her nearness\r\nachingly, and then the light was on once more. She moved toward the\r\ndoor, and there paused, taking his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Dear shadow,\" she said softly, \"I hope your dreams are music.\" She was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nDan stood irresolute in his chamber; he glanced into the large room\r\nwhere Leucon still bent over his work, and the Grey Weaver raised a hand\r\nin a solemn salutation, but said nothing. He felt no urge for the old\r\nman's silent company and turned back into his room to prepare for\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost instantly, it seemed, the dawn was upon him and bright elfin\r\npipings were all about him, while the odd ruddy sun sent a broad\r\nslanting plane of light across the room. He rose as fully aware of his\r\nsurroundings as if he had not slept at all; the pool tempted him and he\r\nbathed in stinging water. Thereafter he emerged into the central\r\nchamber, noting curiously that the globes still glowed in dim rivalry to\r\nthe daylight. He touched one casually; it was cool as metal to his\r\nfingers, and lifted freely from its standard. For a moment he held the\r\ncold flaming thing in his hands, then replaced it and wandered into the\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nGalatea was dancing up the path, eating a strange fruit as rosy as her\r\nlips. She was merry again, once more the happy nymph who had greeted\r\nhim, and she gave him a bright smile as he chose a sweet green ovoid for\r\nhis breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" she called. \"To the river!\"\r\n\r\nShe skipped away toward the unbelievable forest; Dan followed, marveling\r\nthat her lithe speed was so easy a match for his stronger muscles. Then\r\nthey were laughing in the pool, splashing about until Galatea drew\r\nherself to the bank, glowing and panting. He followed her as she lay\r\nrelaxed; strangely, he was neither tired nor breathless, with no sense\r\nof exertion. A question recurred to him, as yet unasked.\r\n\r\n\"Galatea,\" said his voice, \"Whom will you take as mate?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes went serious. \"I don't know,\" she said. \"At the proper time he\r\nwill come. That is a law.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you be happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\" She seemed troubled. \"Isn't everyone happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not where I live, Galatea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that must be a strange place--that ghostly world of yours. A\r\nrather terrible place.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, often enough,\" Dan agreed. \"I wish--\" He paused. What did he\r\nwish? Was he not talking to an illusion, a dream, an apparition? He\r\nlooked at the girl, at her glistening black hair, her eyes, her soft\r\nwhite skin, and then, for a tragic moment, he tried to feel the arms of\r\nthat drab hotel chair beneath his hands--and failed. He smiled; he\r\nreached out his fingers to touch her bare arm, and for an instant she\r\nlooked back at him with startled, sober eyes, and sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Come on! I want to show you my country.\" She set off down the stream,\r\nand Dan rose reluctantly to follow.\r\n\r\nWhat a day that was! They traced the little river from still pool to\r\nsinging rapids, and ever about them were the strange twitterings and\r\npipings that were the voices of the flowers. Every turn brought a new\r\nvista of beauty; every moment brought a new sense of delight. They\r\ntalked or were silent; when they were thirsty, the cool river was at\r\nhand; when they were hungry, fruit offered itself. When they were tired,\r\nthere was always a deep pool and a mossy bank; and when they were\r\nrested, a new beauty beckoned. The incredible trees towered in\r\nnumberless forms of fantasy, but on their own side of the river was\r\nstill the flower-starred meadow. Galatea twisted him a bright-blossomed\r\ngarland for his head, and thereafter he moved always with a sweet\r\nsinging about him. But little by little the red sun slanted toward the\r\nforest, and the hours dripped away. It was Dan who pointed it out, and\r\nreluctantly they turned homeward.\r\n\r\nAs they returned, Galatea sang a strange song, plaintive and sweet as\r\nthe medley of river and flower music. And again her eyes were sad.\r\n\r\n\"What song is that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is a song sung by another Galatea,\" she answered, \"who is my\r\nmother.\" She laid her hand on his arm. \"I will make it into English for\r\nyou.\" She sang:\r\n\r\n    \"The River lies in flower and fern,\r\n        In flower and fern it breathes a song.\r\n    It breathes a song of your return,\r\n        Of your return in years too long.\r\n    In years too long its murmurs bring\r\n        Its murmurs bring their vain replies,\r\n    Their vain replies the flowers sing,\r\n        The flowers sing, 'The River lies!'\"\r\n\r\nHer voice quavered on the final notes; there was silence save for the\r\ntinkle of water and the flower bugles. Dan said, \"Galatea--\" and paused.\r\nThe girl was again somber-eyed, tearful. He said huskily, \"That's a sad\r\nsong, Galatea. Why was your mother sad? You said everyone was happy in\r\nParacosma.\"\r\n\r\n\"She broke a law,\" replied the girl tonelessly. \"It is the inevitable\r\nway to sorrow.\" She faced him. \"She fell in love with a phantom!\"\r\nGalatea said. \"One of your shadowy race, who came and stayed and then\r\nhad to go back. So when her appointed lover came, it was too late; do\r\nyou understand? But she yielded finally to the law, and is forever\r\nunhappy, and goes wandering from place to place about the world.\" She\r\npaused. \"I shall never break a law,\" she said defiantly.\r\n\r\nDan took her hand. \"I would not have you unhappy, Galatea. I want you\r\nalways happy.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"I _am_ happy,\" she said, and smiled a tender,\r\nwistful smile.\r\n\r\nThey were silent a long time as they trudged the way homeward. The\r\nshadows of the forest giants reached out across the river as the sun\r\nslipped behind them. For a distance they walked hand in hand, but as\r\nthey reached the path of pebbly brightness near the house, Galatea drew\r\naway and sped swiftly before him. Dan followed as quickly as he might;\r\nwhen he arrived, Leucon sat on his bench by the portal, and Galatea had\r\npaused on the threshold. She watched his approach with eyes in which he\r\nagain fancied the glint of tears.\r\n\r\n\"I am very tired,\" she said, and slipped within.\r\n\r\nDan moved to follow, but the old man raised a staying hand.\r\n\r\n\"Friend from the shadows,\" he said, \"will you hear me a moment?\"\r\n\r\nDan paused, acquiesced, and dropped to the opposite bench. He felt a\r\nsense of foreboding; nothing pleasant awaited him.\r\n\r\n\"There is something to be said,\" Leucon continued, \"and I say it without\r\ndesire to pain you, if phantoms feel pain. It is this: Galatea loves\r\nyou, though I think she has not yet realized it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love her too,\" said Dan.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Weaver stared at him. \"I do not understand. Substance, indeed,\r\nmay love shadow, but how can shadow love substance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I love her,\" insisted Dan.\r\n\r\n\"Then woe to both of you! For this is impossible in Paracosma; it is a\r\nconfliction with the laws. Galatea's mate is appointed, perhaps even now\r\napproaching.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laws! Laws!\" muttered Dan. \"Whose laws are they? Not Galatea's nor\r\nmine!\"\r\n\r\n\"But they are,\" said the Grey Weaver. \"It is not for you nor for me to\r\ncriticize them--though I yet wonder what power could annul them to\r\npermit your presence here!\"\r\n\r\n\"I had no voice in your laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man peered at him in the dusk. \"Has anyone, anywhere, a voice in\r\nthe laws?\" he queried.\r\n\r\n\"In my country we have,\" retorted Dan.\r\n\r\n\"Madness!\" growled Leucon. \"Man-made laws! Of what use are man-made laws\r\nwith only man-made penalties, or none at all? If you shadows make a law\r\nthat the wind shall blow only from the east, does the west wind obey\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do pass such laws,\" acknowledged Dan bitterly. \"They may be stupid,\r\nbut they're no more unjust than yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ours,\" said the Grey Weaver, \"are the unalterable laws of the world,\r\nthe laws of Nature. Violation is always unhappiness. I have seen it; I\r\nhave known it in another, in Galatea's mother, though Galatea is\r\nstronger than she.\" He paused. \"Now,\" he continued, \"I ask only for\r\nmercy; your stay is short, and I ask that you do no more harm than is\r\nalready done. Be merciful; give her no more to regret.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose and moved through the archway; when Dan followed a moment later,\r\nhe was already removing a square of silver from his device in the\r\ncorner. Dan turned silent and unhappy to his own chamber, where the jet\r\nof water tinkled faintly as a distant bell.\r\n\r\nAgain he rose at the glow of dawn, and again Galatea was before him,\r\nmeeting him at the door with her bowl of fruit. She deposited her\r\nburden, giving him a wan little smile of greeting, and stood facing him\r\nas if waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me, Galatea,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the river bank. To talk.\"\r\n\r\nThey trudged in silence to the brink of Galatea's pool. Dan noted a\r\nsubtle difference in the world about him; outlines were vague, the thin\r\nflower pipings less audible, and the very landscape was queerly\r\nunstable, shifting like smoke when he wasn't looking at it directly. And\r\nstrangely, though he had brought the girl here to talk to her, he had\r\nnow nothing to say, but sat in aching silence with his eyes on the\r\nloveliness of her face.\r\n\r\nGalatea pointed at the red ascending sun. \"So short a time,\" she said,\r\n\"before you go back to your phantom world. I shall be sorry, very\r\nsorry.\" She touched his cheek with her fingers. \"Dear shadow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said Dan huskily, \"that I won't go. What if I won't leave\r\nhere?\" His voice grew fiercer. \"I'll not go! I'm going to stay!\"\r\n\r\nThe calm mournfulness of the girl's face checked him; he felt the irony\r\nof struggling against the inevitable progress of a dream. She spoke.\r\n\"Had I the making of the laws, you should stay. But you can't, dear one.\r\nYou can't!\"\r\n\r\nForgotten now were the words of the Grey Weaver. \"I love you, Galatea,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"And I you,\" she whispered. \"See, dearest shadow, how I break the same\r\nlaw my mother broke, and am glad to face the sorrow it will bring.\" She\r\nplaced her hand tenderly over his. \"Leucon is very wise and I am bound\r\nto obey him, but this is beyond his wisdom because he let himself grow\r\nold.\" She paused. \"He let himself grow old,\" she repeated slowly. A\r\nstrange light gleamed in her dark eyes as she turned suddenly to Dan.\r\n\r\n\"Dear one!\" she said tensely. \"That thing that happens to the old--that\r\ndeath of yours! What follows it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What follows death?\" he echoed. \"Who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" Her voice was quivering. \"But one can't simply--vanish! There\r\nmust be an awakening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" said Dan again. \"There are those who believe we wake to a\r\nhappier world, but--\" He shook his head hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\"It must be true! Oh, it must be!\" Galatea cried. \"There must be more\r\nfor you than the mad world you speak of!\" She leaned very close.\r\n\"Suppose, dear,\" she said, \"that when my appointed lover arrives, I send\r\nhim away. Suppose I bear no child, but let myself grow old, older than\r\nLeucon, old until death. Would I join you in your happier world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Galatea!\" he cried distractedly. \"Oh, my dearest--what a terrible\r\nthought!\"\r\n\r\n\"More terrible than you know,\" she whispered, still very close to him.\r\n\"It is more than violation of a law; it is rebellion! Everything is\r\nplanned, everything was foreseen, except this; and if I bear no child,\r\nher place will be left unfilled, and the places of her children, and of\r\n_their_ children, and so on until some day the whole great plan of\r\nParacosma fails of whatever its destiny was to be.\" Her whisper grew\r\nvery faint and fearful. \"It is destruction, but I love you more than I\r\nfear--death!\"\r\n\r\nDan's arms were about her. \"No, Galatea! No! Promise me!\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, \"I can promise and then break my promise.\" She drew his\r\nhead down; their lips touched, and he felt a fragrance and a taste like\r\nhoney in her kiss. \"At least,\" she breathed. \"I can give you a name by\r\nwhich to love you. Philometros! Measure of my love!\"\r\n\r\n\"A name?\" muttered Dan. A fantastic idea shot through his mind--a way of\r\nproving to himself that all this was reality, and not just a page that\r\nany one could read who wore old Ludwig's magic spectacles. If Galatea\r\nwould speak his name! Perhaps, he thought daringly, perhaps then he\r\ncould stay! He thrust her away.\r\n\r\n\"Galatea!\" he cried. \"Do you remember my name?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded silently, her unhappy eyes on his.\r\n\r\n\"Then say it! Say it, dear!\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at him dumbly, miserably, but made no sound.\r\n\r\n\"Say it, Galatea!\" he pleaded desperately. \"My name, dear--just my\r\nname!\" Her mouth moved; she grew pale with effort and Dan could have\r\nsworn that his name trembled on her quivering lips, though no sound\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nAt last she spoke. \"I can't, dearest one! Oh, I can't! A law forbids\r\nit!\" She stood suddenly erect, pallid as an ivory carving. \"Leucon\r\ncalls!\" she said, and darted away. Dan followed along the pebbled path,\r\nbut her speed was beyond his powers; at the portal he found only the\r\nGrey Weaver standing cold and stern. He raised his hand as Dan appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Your time is short,\" he said. \"Go, thinking of the havoc you have\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's Galatea?\" gasped Dan.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent her away.\" The old man blocked the entrance; for a moment\r\nDan would have struck him aside, but something withheld him. He stared\r\nwildly about the meadow--there! A flash of silver beyond the river, at\r\nthe edge of the forest. He turned and raced toward it, while motionless\r\nand cold the Grey Weaver watched him go.\r\n\r\n\"Galatea!\" he called. \"Galatea!\"\r\n\r\nHe was over the river now, on the forest bank, running through columned\r\nvistas that whirled about him like mist. The world had gone cloudy; fine\r\nflakes danced like snow before his eyes; Paracosma was dissolving around\r\nhim. Through the chaos he fancied a glimpse of the girl, but closer\r\napproach left him still voicing his hopeless cry of \"Galatea!\"\r\n\r\nAfter an endless time, he paused; something familiar about the spot\r\nstruck him, and just as the red sun edged above him, he recognized the\r\nplace--the very point at which he had entered Paracosma! A sense of\r\nfutility overwhelmed him as for a moment he gazed at an unbelievable\r\napparition--a dark window hung in midair before him through which glowed\r\nrows of electric lights. Ludwig's window!\r\n\r\nIt vanished. But the trees writhed and the sky darkened, and he swayed\r\ndizzily in turmoil. He realized suddenly that he was no longer standing,\r\nbut sitting in the midst of the crazy glade, and his hands clutched\r\nsomething smooth and hard--the arms of that miserable hotel chair. Then\r\nat last he saw her, close before him--Galatea, with sorrow-stricken\r\nfeatures, her tear-filled eyes on his. He made a terrific effort to\r\nrise, stood erect, and fell sprawling in a blaze of coruscating lights.\r\n\r\nHe struggled to his knees; walls--Ludwig's room--encompassed him; he\r\nmust have slipped from the chair. The magic spectacles lay before him,\r\none lens splintered and spilling a fluid no longer water-clear, but\r\nwhite as milk.\r\n\r\n\"God!\" he muttered. He felt shaken, sick, exhausted, with a bitter sense\r\nof bereavement, and his head ached fiercely. The room was drab,\r\ndisgusting; he wanted to get out of it. He glanced automatically at his\r\nwatch: four o'clock--he must have sat here nearly five hours. For the\r\nfirst time he noticed Ludwig's absence; he was glad of it and walked\r\ndully out of the door to an automatic elevator. There was no response\r\nto his ring; someone was using the thing. He walked three flights to the\r\nstreet and back to his own room.\r\n\r\nIn love with a vision! Worse--in love with a girl who had never lived,\r\nin a fantastic Utopia that was literally nowhere! He threw himself on\r\nhis bed with a groan that was half a sob.\r\n\r\nHe saw finally the implication of the name Galatea. Galatea--Pygmalion's\r\nstatue, given life by Venus in the ancient Grecian myth. But _his_\r\nGalatea, warm and lovely and vital, must remain forever without the gift\r\nof life, since he was neither Pygmalion nor God.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe woke late in the morning, staring uncomprehendingly about for the\r\nfountain and pool of Paracosma. Slow comprehension dawned; how\r\nmuch--_how much_--of last night's experience had been real? How much was\r\nthe product of alcohol? Or had old Ludwig been right, and was there no\r\ndifference between reality and dream?\r\n\r\nHe changed his rumpled attire and wandered despondently to the street.\r\nHe found Ludwig's hotel at last; inquiry revealed that the diminutive\r\nprofessor had checked out, leaving no forwarding address.\r\n\r\nWhat of it? Even Ludwig couldn't give what he sought, a living Galatea.\r\nDan was glad that he had disappeared; he hated the little professor.\r\nProfessor? Hypnotists called themselves \"professors.\" He dragged through\r\na weary day and then a sleepless night back to Chicago.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-winter when he saw a suggestively tiny figure ahead of him in\r\nthe Loop. Ludwig! Yet what use to hail him? His cry was automatic.\r\n\"Professor Ludwig!\"\r\n\r\nThe elfin figure turned, recognized him, smiled. They stepped into the\r\nshelter of a building.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about your machine, Professor. I'd be glad to pay for the\r\ndamage.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ach_, that was nothing--a cracked glass. But you--have you been ill?\r\nYou look much the worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing,\" said Dan. \"Your show was marvelous,\r\nProfessor--marvelous! I'd have told you so, but you were gone when it\r\nended.\"\r\n\r\nLudwig shrugged. \"I went to the lobby for a cigar. Five hours with a wax\r\ndummy, you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was marvelous!\" repeated Dan.\r\n\r\n\"So real?\" smiled the other. \"Only because you co-operated, then. It\r\ntakes self-hypnosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was real, all right,\" agreed Dan glumly. \"I don't understand\r\nit--that strange beautiful country.\"\r\n\r\n\"The trees were club-mosses enlarged by a lens,\" said Ludwig. \"All was\r\ntrick photography, but stereoscopic, as I told you--three dimensional.\r\nThe fruits were rubber; the house is a summer building on our\r\ncampus--Northern University. And the voice was mine; you didn't speak at\r\nall, except your name at the first, and I left a blank for that. I\r\nplayed your part, you see; I went around with the photographic apparatus\r\nstrapped on my head, to keep the viewpoint always that of the observer.\r\nSee?\" He grinned wryly. \"Luckily I'm rather short, or you'd have seemed\r\na giant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" said Dan, his mind whirling. \"You say you played my\r\npart. Then Galatea--is _she_ real too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea's real enough,\" said the Professor. \"My niece, a senior at\r\nNorthern, and likes dramatics. She helped me out with the thing. Why?\r\nWant to meet her?\"\r\n\r\nDan answered vaguely, happily. An ache had vanished; a pain was eased.\r\nParacosma was attainable at last!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Pygmalion's Spectacles, by Stanley Grauman Weinbaum",
