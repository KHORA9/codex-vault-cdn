These three kinds are: (_a_)\r\nobservations in the field covering the habits and behavior of animals\r\nand their relations to their physical surroundings, to plants, and to\r\neach other; (_b_) work in the laboratory, consisting of the study of\r\nanimal structure by dissection and the observation of live specimens in\r\ncages and aquaria; and (_c_) work in the recitation- or lecture-room,\r\nwhere the significance and general application of the observed facts are\r\nconsidered and some of the elementary facts relating to the\r\nclassification and distribution of animals are learned.\r\n\r\nThese three kinds of work are represented in the course of study\r\noutlined in this book. The sequence and extent of the study in\r\nlaboratory and recitation-room are definitely set forth, but the\r\nreferences to field-work consist chiefly of suggestions to teacher and\r\nstudent regarding the character of the work and the opportunities for\r\nit. Not because the author would give to the field-work the least\r\nimportant place,--he would not,--but because of the utter\r\nimpracticability of attempting to direct the field-work of students\r\nscattered widely over the United States. The differences in season and\r\nnatural conditions in various parts of the country with the\r\ncorresponding differences in the \"seasons\" and course of the\r\nlife-history of the animals of the various regions make it impossible\r\nto include in a book intended for general use specific directions for\r\nfield-work. Further, the amount of time for field-work at the disposal\r\nof teacher and class and the opportunities afforded by the topographic\r\ncharacter of the region in which the schools are located vary much. The\r\ninitiation and direction of this must therefore always depend on the\r\nteacher. On the other hand, the work of the other two phases of study\r\ncan to a large extent be made pretty uniform throughout the country. For\r\ndissection, specimens properly killed and preserved are about as good as\r\nfresh material, and by modifying the suggested sequence of work a little\r\nto suit special conditions or conveniences, the examination of live\r\nspecimens in the laboratory can in most cases be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe author believes that elementary zoological study should not be\r\nlimited to the examination of the structure of several types. The\r\nstudent should learn by observation something of the functions of\r\nanimals and something of their life-history and habits, and should be\r\ngiven a glimpse of the significance of his particular observations and\r\nof their general relation to animal life as a whole. The drill of the\r\nlaboratory is perhaps the most valuable part of the work, but as a\r\nmatter of fact the high school is trying to teach elementary zoology,\r\nan elementary knowledge of animals and their life, and dissection\r\nalone cannot give the pupil this knowledge. On the other hand, without\r\na personal acquaintance with animals, based on careful actual\r\nobservations of their life-history and habits and on the study of the\r\nstructural characters of the animal body by personally made\r\ndissections, the pupil can never really appreciate and understand the\r\nlife of animals. Reading and recitation alone can never give the\r\nstudent any real knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nThe book is divided into three parts, of which Part I should be[1]\r\nfirst undertaken. This is an introduction to an elementary knowledge of\r\nanimal structure, function, and development. It consists of practical\r\nexercises in the laboratory, each followed by a recitation in which the\r\nsignificance of the facts already observed is pointed out. The general\r\nprinciples of zoology are thus defined on a basis of observed facts.\r\n\r\nPart II is devoted to a consideration of the principal branches of the\r\nanimal kingdom; it deals with[2] systematic zoology. In each branch\r\none or more examples are chosen to serve as types. The most important\r\nstructural features of these examples are studied, by dissection, in\r\nthe laboratory. The directions for these dissections consist of\r\ntechnical instructions for dissecting, the calling attention to and\r\nnaming of principal parts, together with questions and demands\r\nintended to call for independent work on the part of the student. The\r\ndirections follow the actual course of the dissection instead of being\r\narranged according to systems of organs, and are intended for the\r\norientation of the student and not to be in themselves expositions of\r\nthe anatomy of the types. The condensation of these directions is made\r\nmore feasible by the presence of anatomical plates (drawn directly\r\nfrom dissections). Following the account of the dissection of the type\r\nare brief notes on its life-history and habits. Then follows a\r\ngeneral account of the branch to which the example dissected belongs\r\nand brief accounts of some of the more interesting members of the\r\nbranch. In these accounts technical directions are given for brief\r\ncomparative examinations and for the study of the life-history and\r\nhabits of some of the more accessible of these forms.\r\n\r\nIt will not be possible, of course, to undertake with any thoroughness\r\nthe consideration of all of the branches of animals in a single year.\r\nBut all are treated in the book, so that the choice of those to be\r\nstudied may rest with the teacher. This choice will of necessity depend\r\nlargely on the opportunities afforded by the situation of the school,\r\nas, for example, whether on the seashore or in the interior near a lake\r\nor river, or on the dry plains, and on the relation of the school-terms\r\nto the seasons of the year. The branches are arranged in the book so\r\nthat the simplest animals are first considered, the slightly complex\r\nones next, and lastly the most highly organized forms. But if in order\r\nto obtain examples for study it is necessary to take up branches\r\nirregularly, that need not prove confusing. The author would suggest\r\nthat whatever other branches are studied, the insects and birds, which\r\nare readily available in all parts of the country, be certainly\r\nselected, and with this selection in view has given them special\r\nattention. Indeed some teachers may find these two branches to offer\r\nquite sufficient work in classificatory and ecological lines.\r\n\r\nPart III is devoted to a necessarily brief consideration of certain of\r\nthe more conspicuous and interesting features of animal ecology. It\r\nhas in it the suggestion for much interesting field-work. The work of\r\nthis part should be taken up in connection with that of Part II, as,\r\nfor example, the consideration of social and communal life in\r\nconnection with the insects, parasitism in connection with the worms,\r\nand also with the insects, distribution in connection with the birds,\r\nperhaps, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn appendices there are added some suggestions for the outfitting of\r\nthe laboratory, and a list of the equipment each student should have.\r\nHere, also, is appended a list of a few good authoritative reference\r\nbooks which should be accessible to students and to which specific\r\nreferences are made in the course of this book. Some practical\r\ndirections for the collecting and preserving of specimens are also\r\ngiven. (Suggestions for the obtaining of material for the various\r\nlaboratory exercises outlined in the book are to be found in\r\n\"technical notes\" included in the directions for each exercise.) The\r\nauthor believes that the building up of a single school-collection in\r\nwhich all the pupils have a common interest and to which all\r\ncontribute is to be encouraged rather than the making of separate\r\ncollections by the pupils. Waste of life is checked by this, and in\r\ntime, with the contributions of succeeding classes, a really good and\r\neffective collection may be built up. The \"collecting interest\" can be\r\ntaken advantage of just as well in connection with a school-collection\r\nas with individual collections.\r\n\r\nThe plates illustrating the dissections have all been drawn originally\r\nfor the book from actual dissections. Most of the other figures are\r\noriginal, either drawn or photographed directly from nature, or from\r\npreserved specimens. Credit is given in each case for figures not\r\noriginal. The drawings for all of the figures of dissections and for\r\nall original figures not otherwise accredited were made by Miss Mary\r\nH. Wellman, to whom the author expresses his obligations. The thanks\r\nof the author are due to Mr. George Otis Mitchell, San Francisco, who\r\nkindly made the photo-micrographs of insect structure from the\r\nauthor's slides; to Professor Mark V. Slingerland, Cornell University,\r\nfor electros of his photographs of insects; to Dr. L. O. Howard, U.\r\nS. Entomologist, for electros of figs. 45, 52, 56, 68, 81, 82, 83, 84,\r\n87, 90, and 92; to Professor L. L. Dyche, University of Kansas, for\r\nphotographs of his mounted groups of mammals; to Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nGrinnell, Pasadena, Calif., for photographs of birds; to Mr. J. O.\r\nSnyder, Stanford University, for photographs of snakes; to Mr. Frank\r\nChapman, editor of \"Bird-lore,\" for electros of photographs of birds;\r\nto Mr. G. O. Shields, editor of \"Recreation,\" for an electro of the\r\nphotograph of a bird; to the American Society of Civil Engineers for\r\nelectros of photographs of boring marine worms; to Cassell & Co., for\r\nelectros of three photographs from nature; to Geo. A. Clark, secretary\r\nFur Seal Commission for photographs of seals; and to the Whitaker and\r\nRay Co., San Francisco, for electros of figs. 46, 59, 60, 61, 64, 65,\r\n93, 94, 97, 98, 99, 100, 102, 119, and 166 to 172, published\r\noriginally in Jenkins & Kellogg's \"Lessons in Nature Study.\" The\r\norigin of each of these pictures is specifically indicated in\r\nconnection with its use in the book.\r\n\r\nThe author's sincere thanks are also due to Mrs. David Starr Jordan\r\nand to Mr. J. C. Brown, graduate student in zoology in Stanford\r\nUniversity, for their assistance in the correction of the MS., and in\r\nthe preparation of the laboratory exercises respectively. The chapters\r\nof Part II relating to the vertebrates were read in MS. by President\r\nDavid Starr Jordan, whose aid and courtesy are gratefully\r\nacknowledged. Similar acknowledgments are due Professors Harold Heath\r\nand R. E. Snodgrass for reading the proofs of the directions for the\r\nlaboratory exercises.\r\n\r\n                             VERNON LYMAN KELLOGG.\r\n\r\n  STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May, 1901.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This is true if a strictly logical treatment of the subject is\r\nheld to. As a matter of fact, it is often of advantage to begin with,\r\nor at least to take up from the beginning in connection with the\r\nindoor work, some field-work, such as the collecting and classifying\r\nof insects and the observation of their metamorphosis. As most schools\r\nbegin work in the fall, advantage must be taken of the favorable\r\nopportunities for field-work at the beginning of the year. These\r\nopportunities are of course much less favorable in the winter.\r\n\r\n[2] The classification of animals used in this book is that adopted in\r\nParker and Haswell's \"Text-book of Zoology\" (2 vols., 1897, Macmillan\r\nCo.). Exception is made in the case of the worms, which are considered\r\nas a single branch, Vermes, instead of as several distinct branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n\r\n\r\n                STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF\r\n                                ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n                I.--THE STUDY OF ANIMALS AND THEIR LIFE.\r\n\r\nOur familiar knowledge of animals and their life, 1.--Zoology and its\r\ndivisions, 2.--A first course in Zoology, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n               II.--THE GARDEN TOAD (BUFO LENTIGINOSUS).\r\n\r\n[Laboratory exercise], 5.--External structure, 5.--Internal structure,\r\n7.\r\n\r\n\r\n          III.--THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE ANIMAL BODY.\r\n\r\nOrgans and functions, 14.--The animal body a machine, 14.--The\r\nessential functions or life-processes, 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   IV.--THE CRAYFISH (CAMBARUS SP.).\r\n\r\n[Laboratory exercise], 17.--External structure, 17.--Internal\r\nstructure, 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n             V.--THE MODIFICATION OF ORGANS AND FUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\nDifference between crayfish and toad, 26.--Resemblances between\r\ncrayfish and toad, 27.--Modification of functions and structure to fit\r\nthe animal to the special conditions of its life, 29.--Vertebrate and\r\ninvertebrate, 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    VI.--AMŒBA AND PARAMŒCIUM.\r\n\r\n[Laboratory exercise], 31.--Amœba, 31.--The slipper-animalcule\r\n(PARAMŒCIUM SP.), 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n            VII.--THE SINGLE-CELLED ANIMAL BODY; PROTOPLASM\r\n                             AND THE CELL.\r\n\r\nThe single-celled animal body, 36.--The cell, 37.--Protoplasm, 39.\r\n\r\n\r\n            VIII.-CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF THE TOAD (OR FROG).\r\n\r\n[Laboratory exercise], 40.--The blood, 40.--The skin, 40.--The liver,\r\n41.--The muscles, 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n           IX.--THE MANY-CELLED ANIMAL BODY; DIFFERENTIATION\r\n                              OF THE CELL.\r\n\r\nThe many-celled animal body, 43.--Differentiation of the cell, 43.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               X.--HYDRA.\r\n\r\n[Laboratory exercise], 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 XI.--THE SIMPLEST MANY-CELLED ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nCell-differentiation and body-organization in Hydra, 52.--Degrees in\r\ncell-differentiation and body-organization, 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XII.--DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOAD.\r\n\r\n[Field and laboratory exercise], 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 XIII.--MULTIPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nMultiplication, 57.--Spontaneous generation, 58.--Simplest\r\nmultiplication and development, 59.--Birth and hatching,\r\n61.--Life-history, 62.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n                  XIV.--THE CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n[Laboratory exercise and recitation], 65.--Basis and significance of\r\nclassification, 65.--Importance of development in determining\r\nclassification, 67.--Scientific names, 68.--An example of\r\nclassification, 68.--Species, 69.--Genus, 70.--Family, 72.--Order,\r\n72.--Class and branch, 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n             XV.--BRANCH PROTOZOA: THE ONE-CELLED ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: THE BELL ANIMALCULE (VORTICELLA SP.)

But\r\nwhat real knowledge of dogs and toads does our familiar\r\nacquaintanceship with them give? Certain habits of the dog are known\r\nto us: it eats, and eats certain kinds of food; it runs about; it\r\nresponds to our calls or even to the mere sight of us; it evidently\r\nfeels pain when struck, and shows fear when threatened. Another class\r\nof attributes of the dog includes those things that we know of its\r\nbodily make-up: its possession of a head with eyes and ears, nose and\r\nmouth; its four legs with toes and claws; its covering of hair. We\r\nknow, too, that it was born alive as a very small helpless puppy which\r\nlived for a while on food furnished by the mother, and that it has\r\ngrown and developed from this young state to a fully grown, fully\r\ndeveloped dog. We know also that our dog is a certain kind of dog, a\r\nspaniel, perhaps, while our neighbor's dog is of another kind, a\r\ngreyhound, it may be. We know accordingly that there are different\r\nkinds of tame dogs, and we may know that wolves are so much like dogs\r\nthat they might indeed be called wild dogs, or dogs called a kind of\r\ntame wolf. But how little we really know about the dog's body and its\r\nlife is apparent at a moment's thought. We see only the outside of the\r\ndog, but what an intricate complex of parts really composes this\r\nanimal! We see it eat and breathe and run; of what is done with the\r\nfood and air inside its body, and of the series of muscle contractions\r\nand mechanical processes which cause its running, we have but the\r\nslightest conception. We see that the pup gets larger, that is, grows;\r\nthat it changes gradually in appearance, that is, develops; but of the\r\nreal processes and changes that take place in growth and development\r\nhow little we know! We know that there are other kinds of dogs; that\r\nwolves and foxes are relatives of the dog; and we have heard that cats\r\nand tigers are relatives also, although more distant ones. We know,\r\ntoo, that all the backboned animals, some of them very unlike dogs,\r\nare believed to be related to each other, but of the thousands of\r\nthese animals and of their relationships our knowledge is scanty.\r\nFinally, of the relations of the dog, and of other animals, to the\r\noutside world, and of the wonderful manner in which the dog's make-up\r\nand behavior fit it to live in its place in the world under the\r\nconditions that surround it, we have probably least knowledge of all.\r\n\r\n=Zoology and its divisions.=--What things we do know about the dog,\r\nhowever, and about its relatives, and what things others know, can be\r\nclassified into several groups, namely, things or facts about what the\r\ndog does, or its behavior, things about the make-up of its body,\r\nthings about its growth and development, things about the kind of dog\r\nit is and the kinds of relatives it has, and things about its\r\nrelations to the outer world, and its special fitness for life.\r\n\r\nAll that is known of these different kinds of facts about the dog\r\nconstitutes our knowledge of the dog and its life. All that is known\r\nby scientific men and others of these different kinds of facts about\r\nall the 500,000 or more kinds of living animals, constitutes our\r\nknowledge of animals and is the science _zoology_.[3] Names have been\r\ngiven to these different groups of facts about animals. The facts\r\nabout the bodily make-up or structure of animals constitute that part\r\nof zoology called animal _anatomy_ or _morphology_; the facts about\r\nthe things animals do, or the functions of animals, compose animal\r\n_physiology_; the facts about the development of animals from young to\r\nadult condition are the facts of animal _development_; the knowledge\r\nof the different kinds of animals and their relationships to each\r\nother is called _systematic_ zoology or animal _classification_; and\r\nfinally the knowledge of the relations of animals to their external\r\nsurroundings, including the inorganic world, plants and other animals,\r\nis called animal _ecology_.\r\n\r\nAny study of animals and their life, that is, of zoology, may include\r\nall or any of these parts of zoology. Most zoologists do, indeed,\r\ndevote their principal attention to some one group of facts about\r\nanimals and are accordingly spoken of as anatomists, or physiologists,\r\nsystematists, and so on. But such a specialization of study should be\r\nmade only after the zoologist has acquired a knowledge of the\r\nprincipal or fundamental facts in all the other branches of zoology.\r\n\r\n=A first course in zoology.=--The first \"course,\" then, in the study\r\nof animals should include the fundamental facts in all these branches\r\nor parts of zoology. That is what the course outlined in this book\r\ntries to cover. But no text-book of zoology can really give the\r\nstudent the knowledge he seeks. He must find out most of it for\r\nhimself; a text-book, based on the experiences of others, is chiefly\r\nvaluable for telling him how to work most effectively to get this\r\nknowledge for himself. And the best students always find out things\r\nwhich are not in books. Especially can the beginning student find out\r\nthings not known before, \"new to science,\" as we say, about the\r\nbehavior and habits of animals, and their relations to their\r\nsurroundings. The life-history of comparatively few kinds of animals\r\nis exactly known; the instincts and habits of comparatively few have\r\nbeen studied in any detail. The kinds of food demanded, the feeding\r\nhabits, nest-building, care of the young, cunning concealment of nest\r\nand self, time of egg-laying or of producing young, duration of the\r\nimmature stages and the habits and behavior of the young animals--a\r\nhost, indeed, of observations on the actual life of animals, remain to\r\nbe made by the \"field naturalist.\" Any beginning student can be a\r\n\"field naturalist\" and can find out new things about animals, that is,\r\ncan add to the science of zoology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Dissection of the Garden Toad (_Bufo\r\nlentiginosus_).]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] Zoology is formed from two Greek words: _zoon_, meaning animal,\r\nand _logos_, meaning discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                 THE GARDEN TOAD (_Bufo lentiginosus_)\r\n\r\n                          LABORATORY EXERCISE\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Although this description is written for the toad\r\n    it will fit for the dissection of the frog. It will be found,\r\n    after casting aside a few ungrounded prejudices, that the toad is\r\n    the better for class dissection. Toads are best collected about\r\n    dusk, when they can be picked up in almost any garden in town or\r\n    in the country. During the spring many can be found in the ponds\r\n    where they are breeding. To kill the toad place it in an air-tight\r\n    vessel with a piece of cotton or cloth saturated in chloroform or\r\n    ether. When the toad is dead, wash off the specimen and put in a\r\n    dissecting pan for study. Several specimens should be placed in a\r\n    nitric acid solution for a day or so (for directions for\r\n    preparing, see p. 12) to be used later for the study of the\r\n    nervous system. Also several specimens should be injected for the\r\n    better study of the circulatory system. With an injecting mass\r\n    made as directed on p. 451 introduce through a small canula into\r\n    the ventricle of the heart. This will inject the arterial system,\r\n    and with increased pressure the injecting mass may be forced\r\n    through the valves of the heart, thus passing into the auricles\r\n    and throughout the venous system. After injecting use the specimen\r\n    fresh or after it has been preserved in 4% formalin.\r\n\r\n=External structure.=--Note that the body of the toad is divided into\r\nseveral principal regions or parts, as is the human body, namely, a\r\n_head_, _upper limbs_, _trunk_, and _lower limbs_. As you look at the\r\ntoad note the similarity of the parts on one side to those of the other,\r\nas right leg corresponding to left leg, right eye to left eye, etc. This\r\narrangement of the body in similar halves among animals is known as\r\n_bilateral symmetry_. As a rule animals which show bilateral symmetry\r\nmove in a definite direction. The part that moves forward is the\r\n_anterior end_, while the opposite extremity is the _posterior end_. In\r\nmost animals we note two other views or aspects; that which is called\r\nthe \"back\" and with most animals is, under ordinary conditions,\r\nuppermost is the _dorsum_ or _dorsal aspect_, while that which lies\r\nbelow is the _venter_ or _ventral aspect_. When referring to a view from\r\none side we speak of it as a right or left _lateral aspect_. These terms\r\nhold good for most of the animals that we shall study.\r\n\r\nNote at the anterior end of the toad a wide transverse slit, the\r\n_mouth_. What other openings are on the anterior end? Note the two large\r\n_eyes_, the organs of sight. Just back of each eye note an elliptical,\r\nsmooth membrane. This is the tympanum of the outer _ear_, and through\r\nthis membrane the vibrations produced by sound-waves are transferred to\r\nthe inner ear, which receives sensations and transmits them to the\r\nbrain. Open the mouth by drawing down the lower jaw. Note just within\r\nthe angle of the lower jaw the _tongue_. How is it attached to the wall\r\nof the mouth? On the tongue are a great many fine _papillæ_ in which is\r\nlocated the sense of taste. It has now been seen that most of the\r\nspecial senses of the toad have their seat in the head. Pass a straw or\r\nbristle into one of the nostrils. Where does it come out? These internal\r\nopenings to the nose are the _inner nares_. Note in the roof of the\r\nmouth just posterior to each of the eyeballs an opening. These are the\r\ninternal openings to the wide _Eustachian tubes_, which lead to the\r\nmouth from the chamber of the ear behind the tympanum.\r\n\r\nNote far back in the mouth an opening through which food passes. This\r\nis the _œsophagus_ or _gullet_. Note just below this gullet an\r\nelevation in which is a perpendicular slit, the _glottis_. This is the\r\nupper end of the _laryngo-tracheal chamber_, and the flaps within on\r\neither side of the slit are the _vocal cords_.\r\n\r\nNote at the posterior end of the body in the median line an opening.\r\nThis is the _anal opening_ or _anus_. Note the general make-up of the\r\ntoad. How do its arms compare with our own? How do its fore feet\r\n(hands) differ from its hind feet? Note that the body is covered by a\r\ntough enveloping membrane, the _skin_. In the skin are many glands\r\nwhich by their excretion keep it soft and moist.\r\n\r\n    =Internal structure.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--With a fine pair of\r\n    scissors make a longitudinal median cut through the skin of the\r\n    venter from the anal opening to the angle of the lower jaw. Spread\r\n    the cut edges apart and pin back in the dissecting-pan.\r\n\r\nNote the complex system of _muscles_ which govern the movements of the\r\ntongue. Observe a number of pairs of muscles overlying the bones which\r\nsupport the arms. These are attached to the _pectoral_ or\r\n_shoulder-girdle_. Note the large sheet of muscles covering the\r\nventral aspect of the toad. These are the _abdominal muscles_, which\r\nconsist of two sets, an outer and an inner layer. Note that\r\nposteriorly the abdominal muscles are attached to a bone. This is the\r\n_pubic bone_ of the _pelvic girdle_ which supports the hind legs.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--With the scissors cut through the muscles of the\r\n    body wall at the pubic bone and pass the points forward to the\r\n    shoulder-girdle. Separate the bones of the shoulder-girdle and pin\r\n    out the flaps of skin and muscle to right and left in the\r\n    dissecting-pan (see fig. 1). Cover the dissection with clear water\r\n    or weak alcohol.\r\n\r\nNote two large conspicuous soft brown lobes of tissue. These form the\r\n_liver_, an organ which produces a secretion that assists in the process\r\nof digestion. Note just anterior to the liver and extending between its\r\ntwo lobes a pear-shaped organ, the _heart_, which may yet be pulsating.\r\nAre these pulsations regular? How many occur in a minute? The lower end\r\nor apex of the heart, _ventricle_, undergoes a contraction, forcing\r\nblood out into the _blood-vessels_. This is followed by a relaxation of\r\nthe apex and a contraction of the basal portion, the _auricle_. The\r\nheart is surrounded by a delicate semi-transparent sac, the\r\n_pericardium_. The pericardium is filled with a watery fluid,\r\n_body-lymph_, which bathes the heart. Note between the lobes of the\r\nliver a small bladder-shaped transparent organ of a pinkish color. This\r\nis the _gall-cyst_, or _gall-bladder_, a reservoir for the _bile_, the\r\nsecretion from the liver. Separate the lobes of the liver and note,\r\nbeneath, the long convoluted tube which fills most of the body-cavity.\r\nThis is part of the _alimentary canal_. Is the alimentary canal of\r\nuniform character? The most anterior portion of the canal, the _gullet_\r\nor _œsophagus_, leads to a large U-shaped enlargement, the _stomach_.\r\nFrom the lower end of the stomach there extends a long, slender, very\r\nmuch convoluted tube, the _small intestine_, which is followed by a much\r\nlarger one, the _large intestine_. This large intestine after one or two\r\nturns passes directly back into the _rectum_, which opens at last to the\r\nexterior through the anus. Note just ventral to the rectum a large\r\nthin-walled membranous sac. This is the _urinary bladder_ which acts as\r\na reservoir for the secretion from the _kidneys_. Notice a many-branched\r\nyellow structure with a glistening appearance, the _fat-body_ (_corpus\r\nadiposum_). Now push liver and intestine to one side and note the\r\npinkish sac-like bodies (perhaps filled with air), the _lungs_. The\r\nlungs are paired bodies which open into the laryngo-tracheal chamber.\r\nThe toad takes air into its mouth through its nostrils, and then forces\r\nit, by a kind of swallowing action, through the laryngo-tracheal chamber\r\ninto the lungs.\r\n\r\nNow lift the stomach and note in the loop between its lower end and the\r\nsmall intestine a thin transparent tissue. This is a part of the\r\n_mesentery_, which will be found to suspend the whole alimentary canal\r\nand its attached organs to the dorsal wall of the body. Note in the\r\nloop of the stomach in the mesentery an irregular pinkish glandular\r\nstructure which leads by a small duct into the intestine. This gland is\r\nthe _pancreas_, and the duct is the _pancreatic duct_. From it comes a\r\nsecretion which aids in the digestion of food. Near the upper end of the\r\npancreas note a round nodular structure, generally dark red. This is the\r\n_spleen_, a ductless gland, the use of which is not altogether known.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing which will show as many of the organs noted as possible.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Pass two pieces of thread under the rectum near\r\n    the pubic bone. Tie these threads tightly a short distance apart\r\n    and then cut the rectum in two between the threads. Now carefully\r\n    lift up the alimentary canal with attached organs (liver, etc.),\r\n    and cut it off near the region of the heart.\r\n\r\nHow is the heart situated with regard to the lungs? The _heart_\r\nconsists of a lower chamber with thick muscular walls, the tip, called\r\nthe _ventricle_, and two upper thin-walled chambers, the _right_ and\r\n_left auricles_. Can you make out these three chambers? The purified\r\nblood from the lungs flows into the left auricle, while the venous\r\nblood from all over the body laden with its carbon dioxide enters the\r\nright auricle. From these two chambers the blood enters the ventricle.\r\nHere the pure and impure blood are mixed. From the ventricle the blood\r\nenters a large muscular tube on the ventral side of the heart. This is\r\nthe _conus arteriosus_, which gives off three branches on each side;\r\nthe anterior ones, the _carotid arteries_, supply the head, the next\r\nones, the _systemic arteries_, or _aortæ_, carry blood to the rest of\r\nthe body, while the posterior vessels, the _pulmonary arteries_, go\r\ndirectly to the lungs and there break up into fine vessels\r\n(_capillaries_) where the carbon dioxide is given off and oxygen is\r\ntaken from the air. From the lungs the blood returns through the\r\n_pulmonary vein_ to the left auricle. Meanwhile the blood which has\r\npassed through the systemic arteries and body capillaries is collected\r\nagain into other vessels going back to the heart; these are the\r\n_veins_, which empty into a large thin-walled reservoir, the _sinus\r\nvenosus_, which in turn connects with the right auricle of the heart.\r\nThree large veins enter the sinus venosus, namely, two _pre-caval\r\nveins_ at the anterior end, and a single _post-caval vein_ at the\r\nposterior end. Trace out the larger arteries and veins from the heart\r\nto their division into or origin from the smaller vessels.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Carefully remove the heart together with the lungs.\r\n    The lungs may be inflated by blowing into them through the\r\n    laryngo-tracheal chamber with a quill and tying them tightly, after\r\n    which they should be left for several days to dry. When perfectly\r\n    dry, sections may be cut through them in various places with a sharp\r\n    knife, and by this means a very good idea of the simple lung\r\n    structure of the lower backboned animals can be obtained. With a\r\n    sharp knife cut the heart open, beginning at the tip (ventricle) and\r\n    cutting up through the conus arteriosus and the two auricles. Note\r\n    the valves in the heart which separate the different compartments.\r\n\r\nNote on either side of the median line in the dorsal region a pair of\r\nreddish glandular bodies (_the kidneys_). From each kidney trace a\r\ntube (_ureter_) posteriorly toward the region of the anus. The kidneys\r\nare the principal excretory organs of the body. The blood which flows\r\nthrough the delicate blood-vessels in the kidney gives up there much\r\nof its waste products. These pass out through small tubules of the\r\nkidneys into the ureters, which carry the wastes toward the anus.\r\nAlong one side of each kidney may be seen a yellowish glistening mass,\r\nthe _adrenal body_.\r\n\r\nIn some of the specimens studied, the body cavity may be filled with\r\nthousands of little black spherical bodies. These are undeveloped\r\n_eggs_. They are deposited by the mother toad in the water in long\r\nstrings of transparent jelly, which are usually wound around sticks or\r\nplant-stems at the bottom of the pond near the shore. From these eggs\r\nthe young toads hatch as tadpoles and in their life-history pass\r\nthrough an interesting metamorphosis. (See Chapter XII.)\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The teacher should be provided with several\r\n    well-cleaned skeletons of the toad in order that the bones may be\r\n    carefully studied. Boil in a soap solution a toad from which most\r\n    of the muscles and skin have been removed (see p. 452). Leave in\r\n    this solution until the muscles are quite soft and then pick off\r\n    all bits of muscles and tissue from the bones. If this is\r\n    carefully done, the ligaments which bind the bones will be left\r\n    intact and the skeleton will hold together.\r\n\r\nNote that the _skeleton_ (fig. 2) consists of a head portion which is\r\ncomposed of many bones joined together to form a bony box, the\r\n_skull_; of a series of small segments, the _vertebræ_, forming the\r\n_vertebral column_, which with the skull forms the _axial skeleton_;\r\nand of the _appendicular skeleton_, consisting of the bones of the\r\nfore and hind limbs. Note that the skull is composed of many bones\r\njoined together, some by _sutures_, while others are fused. Do the\r\nlimbs attach directly to the axial skeleton? The anterior limbs (arms)\r\narticulate with the _pectoral_ or _shoulder-girdle_. The arms will be\r\nseen to be made up of a number of bones placed end to end. Note that\r\nthe uppermost, the _humerus_, is attached to the pectoral girdle,\r\nwhile at its lower end it articulates with the _radio-ulna_. At the\r\nlower end of the radio-ulna is a small series of _carpal_ bones which\r\nafford attachments for the slender finger-bones, the _phalanges_ or\r\n_digital_ bones. The bones of the leg are articulated with a closely\r\nfused set of bones, the _pelvic girdle_. The leg-bones, proceeding\r\nfrom the pelvic girdle, are named _femur_, _tibio-fibula_, _tarsal_\r\nbones, and _phalanges_ or _digits_. To what bones of the arm do these\r\ncorrespond? Determine the other principal bones of the skeleton by\r\nreference to figure 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Skeleton of the garden toad.]\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--In a specimen which has been macerated for some\r\n    time in 20% nitric acid dissect out the nervous system. Place the\r\n    specimen in a pan ventral side uppermost and pin out. Carefully pick\r\n    away the vertebræ and the roof of the mouth-cavity, thereby exposing\r\n    the central nervous system, which will appear light yellow.\r\n\r\nExamine the _brain_. In front of the true brain are the _olfactory\r\nlobes_, the nervous centre for the sense of smell. The brain itself is\r\ncomposed of several parts. The anterior portion consists of two\r\nelongated parts, the _cerebral hemispheres_; just back of these are the\r\noptic lobes or _midbrain_, consisting of two short lobes, which are\r\nfollowed by the small _cerebellum_, which in turn is followed by a long\r\npart, the _medulla oblongata_, which runs imperceptibly into the long\r\ndorsal nerve, the _spinal cord_. Note the large _optic nerves_ running\r\nout to each eye. How far backward does the spinal cord extend? Note the\r\nmany pairs of nerves given off from the brain and spinal cord. These\r\nnerves branch and subdivide until they end in very fine fibres. Some end\r\nin the muscle-fibres, and through them the central nervous system\r\ninnervates the muscles. These are _motor endings_. Still others pass to\r\nthe surface and receive impressions from the outside. These last are\r\n_sensory endings_. Note that the _spinal nerves_ arise from the spinal\r\ncord by two roots, an _anterior_ or _ventral_, and a _posterior_ or\r\n_dorsal root_. Trace the principal spinal nerves to the body-parts\r\ninnervated by them. These nerves are numbered as first, second, etc.,\r\naccording to the number of the vertebræ (counting from the head\r\nbackward) from behind which they arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                   THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE\r\n                              ANIMAL BODY\r\n\r\n\r\n=Organs and functions.=--The body of the toad is composed of various\r\nparts, such as the lungs, the heart, the muscles, the eyes, the\r\nstomach, and others. The life of the toad consists of the performance\r\nby it of various processes, such as breathing, digesting food,\r\ncirculating blood, moving, seeing, and others. These various processes\r\nare performed by the various parts of the body. The parts of the body\r\nare called _organs_, and the processes (or work) they perform are\r\ncalled their _functions_. The lungs are the principal organs for the\r\nfunction of breathing; the heart, arteries and veins are the organs\r\nwhich have for their function the circulation of the blood; the\r\nprincipal organ concerned in the digestion of food is the alimentary\r\ncanal, the function of seeing is performed by the organs of sight, the\r\neyes, and so one might continue the catalogue of all the organs of the\r\nbody and of all the functions performed by the animal.\r\n\r\n=The animal body a machine.=--The whole body of the toad is a machine\r\ncomposed of various parts, each part with its special work or business\r\nto do, but all depending on one another and all co-operating to\r\naccomplish the total work of living. The locomotive engine is a\r\nmachine similarly composed of various parts, each part with its\r\nspecial work or function, and all the parts depending on one another\r\nand so working together as to perform satisfactorily the work for\r\nwhich the locomotive engine is intended. An important difference\r\nbetween the locomotive engine and the toad's body is that one is a\r\nlifeless machine and the other a living machine. But there is a real\r\nsimilarity between the two in that both are composed of special parts,\r\neach part performing a special kind of work or function, and all the\r\nparts and functions so fitted together as to form a complex machine\r\nwhich successfully accomplishes the work for which it is intended. And\r\nthis similarity is one which should help make plain the fundamental\r\nfact of animal structure and physiology, namely, the division of the\r\nbody into numerous parts or organs, and the division of the total work\r\nof living into various processes which are the special work or\r\nfunctions of the various organs.\r\n\r\n=The essential functions or life-processes.=--The toad has a great\r\nmany different special parts in its body. Its body is very complex. It\r\nperforms a great many different functions, that is, does a great many\r\ndifferent things in its living. And the structure and life of most of\r\nthe other animals with which we are familiar are similarly complex: a\r\nfish, or a rabbit, or a bird has a body composed of many different\r\nparts, and is capable of doing many different things. Are all animals\r\nsimilarly complex in structure, and capable of doing such a great\r\nvariety of things? We shall find that the answer to this question is\r\nNo. There are many animals in which the body is composed of but a few\r\nparts, and whose life includes the performance of fewer functions or\r\nprocesses than in the case of the toad. There are many animals which\r\nhave no eyes nor ears nor other organs of special sense. There are\r\nanimals without legs or other special organs of locomotion; some\r\nanimals have no blood and hence no heart nor arteries and veins. But\r\nin the life of every animal there are certain processes which must be\r\nperformed, and the body must be so arranged or composed as to be\r\ncapable of performing these necessary life-processes. All animals take\r\nfood, digest it, and assimilate it, that is, convert it into new body\r\nsubstance; all animals take in oxygen and give off carbonic acid gas;\r\nall animals have the power of movement or motion (not necessarily\r\nlocomotion); all animals have the power of sensation, that is, can\r\nfeel; all animals can reproduce themselves, that is, produce young.\r\nThese are the necessary life-processes. It is evident that the toad\r\ncould still live if it had no eyes. Seeing is not one of the necessary\r\nfunctions or processes of life. Nor is hearing, nor is leaping, nor\r\nare many of the things which the toad can do; and animals can exist,\r\nand do exist, without any of those organs which enable the toad to see\r\nand hear and leap. But the body of any animal must be capable of\r\nperforming the few essential processes which are necessary to animal\r\nlife. How surprisingly simple such a body can be will be later\r\ndiscovered. But in most animals the body is a complicated object, and\r\nis able to do many things which are accessory to the really essential\r\nlife-processes, and which make its life complex and elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                     THE CRAYFISH (_Cambarus_ sp.)\r\n\r\n                          LABORATORY EXERCISE\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The crayfish, or crawfish, is found in most of\r\n    the fresh-water ponds and streams of the United States. (It is not\r\n    found east of the Hoosatonic River, Mass. In this region the\r\n    lobster may be used. On the Pacific coast the crayfishes belong to\r\n    the genus _Astacus_.) Crayfishes may be taken by a net baited with\r\n    dead fish, or they may be caught in a trap made from a box with\r\n    ends which open in, and baited with dead fish or animal refuse of\r\n    any sort. This box should be placed in a pond or stream frequented\r\n    by crayfish. If possible the student should study the living\r\n    animal and observe its habits. Crayfish which are to be kept alive\r\n    should be placed in a moist chamber in a cool place. They will\r\n    keep for a longer time in a moist chamber than in water. Some\r\n    fresh specimens should be injected by the teacher for the study of\r\n    the circulatory system. A watery solution of coloring matter or,\r\n    better, of an injecting mass of gelatine (see p. 451) is injected\r\n    into the heart through the needle of a hypodermic syringe. For the\r\n    purpose of injecting, a small bit of the shell may be removed from\r\n    the cephalothorax above the heart. Specimens which are to be kept\r\n    for some time should be placed in alcohol or 4% formalin.\r\n\r\n=External structure= (fig. 3).--Place a specimen in a pan for study.\r\nNote that the body, which of course differs much in shape from that of\r\nthe toad, is also unlike that of the toad in being covered by a hard\r\ncalcareous _exoskeleton_, which acts as a covering for the soft parts\r\nand also as a place of attachment for the muscles, just as the\r\ninternal skeleton does in the case of the toad. The body is composed\r\nof an anterior part, the _cephalothorax_, and a posterior part, the\r\n_abdomen_. The cephalothorax is covered above and on the sides by the\r\n_carapace_, which is divided into parts corresponding to the head and\r\nthorax of the toad by the transverse _cervical suture_. The abdomen\r\nis composed of segments. How many? The flattened terminal segment is\r\ncalled the _telson_. Is the cephalothorax composed of segments? Where\r\nis the mouth of the crayfish? Where is the anal opening?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Ventral aspect of crayfish (_Cambarus_ sp.),\r\nwith the appendages of one side disarticulated.]\r\n\r\nAt the anterior end of the cephalothorax note a sharp projection, the\r\n_rostrum_. Where are the eyes? Remove one of them and examine its\r\nouter surface with a microscope. A bit of the outer wall should be\r\ntorn off and mounted on a glass slide. Note that it is made up of a\r\ngreat many little facets placed side by side. Each of these facets is\r\nthe external window of an eye element or _ommatidium_. An eye composed\r\nin this way is called a _compound eye_. In front of the eyes note two\r\npairs of slender many-segmented appendages. The shorter pair, the\r\n_antennules_, are two-branched. Remove one of them and note at its\r\nbase a small slit along the upper surface. This slit opens into a\r\nsmall bag-like structure which contains fine sand-grains. The bag is\r\nprotected by a series of fine bristles along the edge of the slit.\r\nThis bag-like structure is believed to be an auditory organ. The\r\nlonger pair of appendages are the _antennæ_, and in the fine hair-like\r\nprojections upon the joints is believed to be located the sense of\r\nsmell. Thus it will be seen that the sense-organs of the crayfish,\r\nlike those of the toad, are located on the head. Beneath the basal\r\nportion of each antenna there is a flat plate-like projection, at the\r\nbase of which on the upper edge will be noted a small opening, the\r\nexit of the kidney, or _green gland_.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the surface of part of an eye; also of an antennule;\r\nand of an antenna.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Stick one point of the scissors under the\r\n    posterior end of the carapace on the right side, and cut forward,\r\n    thus exposing a large cavity, the gill-chamber. Remove all of the\r\n    mouth-parts, legs and abdominal appendages from the right side,\r\n    being careful to leave the fringe-like parts, the gills, attached\r\n    to their respective legs. Place all of the appendages in order on\r\n    a piece of cardboard.\r\n\r\nExamine the abdominal appendages, called _pleopods_, or swimming feet.\r\nHow many pairs are there? Each is composed of a basal part, the\r\n_protopodite_, and two terminal segments, an inner one, the\r\n_endopodite_, and an outer, the _exopodite_. In the males the first\r\nand second pleopods of the abdomen are larger and less flexible than\r\nthe others. In the female the pleopods serve to carry the eggs and the\r\nfirst two pairs are very small or absent. Note the last set of\r\nabdominal appendages. These are the _uropods_, which together with the\r\ntelson form the tail.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the pleopods of one side.\r\n\r\nExamine the appendages of the cephalothorax. Like the appendages of\r\nthe abdomen the typical composition of each includes a protopodite, an\r\nexopodite and an endopodite, but some of these appendages are much\r\nmodified, and show a loss of one of these parts, or the addition of an\r\nextra part. The cephalothoracic appendages may be divided into three\r\ngroups, an anterior group of three pairs of mouth-parts (belonging to\r\nthe head) of which the first pair is the _mandibles_ and the others\r\nare the _maxillæ_; a second group of three pairs of foot-jaws or\r\n_maxillipeds_, belonging to the thorax, and a third group of five\r\npairs of _walking-legs_. The mandibles, lying next to the\r\nmouth-opening, are hard and jaw-like and lack the exopodite; the first\r\nmaxillæ are small and also lack the exopodite; the second maxillæ have\r\na large paddle-like structure which extends back over the gills on\r\neach side within the space, the _branchial chamber_, above the gills.\r\nIt is by means of this paddle-like structure (the _scaphognathite_)\r\nthat currents of water are kept up through the gill-chambers. The\r\nmaxillipeds increase in size from first to third pair. Each pair of\r\nwalking-legs except the last bears _gills_. These gills are the organs\r\nby which the blood is purified. The blood of the crayfish flows into\r\nthe large vessels on the outer sides of the gill and thence into the\r\nfine vessels in the little leaf-like lamellæ. At the same time the air\r\nwhich is mixed with the water bathing the gills passes freely through\r\nthe thin membranous walls of these lamellæ and blood-vessels, and the\r\nblood gives off its carbonic acid gas to the water and takes up oxygen\r\nfrom the air in the water. Thus it will be seen that the office of the\r\ngill is like that of the lung in the toad, namely, to act as an organ\r\nfor the elimination of carbonic acid gas and the taking up of oxygen.\r\n\r\nNote the pincer-like appendages of the first pair of legs. These pincers\r\nare the _chelæ_, with which food is torn into bits and placed in the\r\nmouth. In the basal segment of each of the last pair of legs of the male\r\nnote the _genital pore_. In the female the _genital pores_ are in the\r\nbasal segments of the next to last pair of legs. Is the crayfish\r\nbilaterally symmetrical? Note the repetition of parts in the crayfish,\r\nthat is, the recurrence of similar parts in successive segments. This\r\nserial repetition of parts among animals is called _metemerism_.\r\n\r\n    =Internal structure= (fig. 4).--TECHNICAL NOTE.--With a pair of\r\n    scissors cut through the dorsal wall of the cephalothorax into the\r\n    body-cavity. Cut the body-wall away from both sides and remove the\r\n    middle portion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Diagrammatic median longitudinal section of\r\ncrayfish (_Cambarus_ sp.).]\r\n\r\nAt the anterior end of the cephalothorax note the large membranous\r\nsac, the _stomach_. Attached to each end of this are sets of muscles\r\nwhich control its movements. To the right and left of the stomach\r\nnotice attached to the shell large muscles which connect by stout\r\nligaments at their lower ends with the mandibles. Note a yellow\r\nfringe-like structure, the _digestive gland_, which fills most of the\r\nregion about the stomach. It connects by a pair of small tubes, the\r\n_bile-ducts_, with the alimentary canal. Within the posterior portion\r\nof the cephalothorax note a pentagonal sac, the _heart_, contained\r\nwithin a delicate membrane, the _pericardium_. Remove the pericardium\r\nand note a pair of dorsal openings into the heart, called _ostia_.\r\n(There are also two lateral pairs and a ventral pair of ostia.) Note\r\npassing anteriorly from the heart along the median line to the eyes a\r\nblood-vessel, the _ophthalmic artery_. Arising from the anterior\r\nportion of the heart are the _antennary arteries_, running to the\r\nantennæ. Yet another pair running anteriorly from the heart to the\r\nstomach and digestive glands are called the _hepatic arteries_. From\r\nthe posterior end of the heart arises the _dorsal abdominal artery_,\r\nrunning back to the telson. Below this arises the _sternal_ artery,\r\nwhich will be seen later.\r\n\r\nIn the region below the heart are located the reproductive organs.\r\nThey are whitish glandular masses from each of which runs a tube which\r\nopens at the base of the last pair of walking-legs in the male, and at\r\nthe base of the third pair of walking-legs in the female.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Cut longitudinally through the dorsal wall of the\r\n    abdomen on either side of the median line and remove the piece of\r\n    shell.\r\n\r\nNote the powerful _muscles_ within which flex and extend the abdomen. By\r\na rapid contraction of these muscles the tail is brought beneath the\r\nbody, propelling the animal strongly backwards. When the crayfish crawls\r\nit generally goes forward, but in swimming it reverses this direction.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing showing, in their natural position, the internal organs\r\nwhich have been studied.\r\n\r\nExamine the alimentary canal for its whole length. Note that the large\r\nbladder-shaped stomach is attached to the mouth-opening by a short\r\ntube. What part of the canal is this? From the posterior end of the\r\nstomach is a short thick-walled part, the _small intestine_, followed\r\nby a long straight tube, the _large intestine_, which opens to the\r\nexterior through the _anus_.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Remove the alimentary canal, detaching it from\r\n    the anal end first, and working forward.\r\n\r\nCut the stomach open. Note an anterior portion, the _cardiac chamber_,\r\nand a smaller posterior portion, the _pyloric chamber_. Examine its\r\ninner surface. What do you find here? This structure is called the\r\n_gastric mill_. Food, which for the most part consists of any dead\r\norganic matter, is chewed by the \"stomach-teeth\" into fine bits, and\r\nis then passed into the pyloric chamber. It is here that the digestive\r\nglands empty their secretion into the food. These glands have the same\r\noffice as have the liver and pancreas combined in the toad, and so\r\nthey are often called the _hepato-pancreas_. When the stomach has been\r\nremoved there will be noted in the anterior portion of the body\r\npaired, flattened bodies, already mentioned, which connect with\r\nopenings at the base of each of the antennæ by means of wide\r\nthin-walled sacs, the _ureters_. These organs are the _kidneys_, or\r\n_green glands_. Their office is similar to that of the kidneys in the\r\ntoad, namely, the elimination of waste from the body.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Carefully remove all of the alimentary canal,\r\n    digestive glands, and reproductive organs. This process will\r\n    expose the floor of the cephalothorax. Now cut away from either\r\n    side the horny floor or bridge at the bottom of the cephalothorax.\r\n    If the specimen has not already been immersed, place it in clear\r\n    water for further dissection.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing dissection will expose the _central nervous system_. It\r\nextends as a series of paired _ganglia_ connected by a double nerve-cord\r\nalong the ventral median line from the œsophagus to the last segment of\r\nthe abdomen. From what points do the lateral nerves arise? Anteriorly\r\nthe double nerve-cord divides, the two parts passing upward on each\r\nside of the œsophagus, where they again meet to form the\r\n_supra-œsophageal ganglion_ or _brain_. Where do the nerves run which\r\nrise from the brain? What is the difference between the position of the\r\ncentral nervous system in the crayfish and in the toad?\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nJust beneath the nerve-cord note a blood-vessel extending the length\r\nof the body. This is the _sternal artery_, which arises from the\r\nposterior end of the heart and passes ventrally at one side of the\r\nalimentary canal and between the nerve-cords. Here the sternal artery\r\ndivides into an anterior and a posterior branch, from which lesser\r\nbranches are given off to each one of the appendages. The various\r\narteries running to all parts of the body finally pour out the blood\r\ninto the body-cavity, where it flows freely in the spaces among the\r\nvarious tissues and organs. After the blood has bathed the body\r\ntissues it flows to the gills on either side, passing up the outer\r\nside of the gill through delicate thin-walled vessels, where it is\r\noxygenated as has already been described. From the gills the purified\r\nblood flows back on the inner side through a large chamber, _sinus_,\r\ninto the pericardium, through the ostia of the heart, whence it is\r\ndriven into the arteries once more. This sort of a circulatory system\r\nin which the blood in places is not enclosed in a definite vessel is\r\nknown as an _open system_. In the toad we find the blood in a _closed\r\nsystem_, i.e., arteries leading into capillaries which in turn lead\r\ninto veins, in no case allowing the blood to pass freely through the\r\nspaces of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                THE MODIFICATION OF ORGANS AND FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Differences between crayfish and toad.=--In the dissection of the\r\ncrayfish one of the most important things in the study of zoology has\r\nbeen learned. It is plain that the crayfish has a body composed, like\r\nthe toad's, of parts or organs, and that most of these organs,\r\nalthough differing much in appearance and actual structure from those\r\nof the toad, correspond to similarly named organs of the toad, and\r\nperform the same functions or processes, although with many striking\r\ndifferences, essentially in the same way as in the toad. But the\r\nstructure of the body is very different in the two animals. The toad\r\nhas an internal body skeleton to which the muscles are attached, and a\r\nsoft, yielding, outer body-covering or skin; the crayfish has no\r\ninternal skeleton, but has its body covered by a horny, firm body-wall\r\nto which the muscles are attached. The toad has its main nervous chain\r\nlying just beneath the dorsal wall of the body; the crayfish has its\r\nmain nervous chain lying just above the ventral wall of the body. The\r\ntoad has lungs and takes up oxygen from the air of the atmosphere; the\r\ncrayfish has gills and takes up oxygen from the air which is mixed\r\nwith the water. The toad has a single pair of jaws; the crayfish has\r\nseveral pairs of mouth-parts. The toad has four legs fitted for\r\nleaping; the crayfish has numerous legs fitted for crawling or\r\nswimming. The crayfish's body is composed of a series of body-rings\r\nor segments; the toad's body is a compact apparently unsegmented mass.\r\nThe toad has eyes each with a single large lens and capable of moving\r\nin the head and of changing their shape and hence their focus; the\r\ncrayfish's eyes are immovable and have a fixed focus, and are composed\r\nof hundreds of tiny eyes each with lens and special retina of its own.\r\nAnd so a long list of differences might be gone through with.\r\n\r\n=Resemblances between toad and crayfish.=--But on the other hand there\r\nare many resemblances--resemblances both in structure and life-processes\r\nor physiology. Both toad and crayfish have organs for the prehension of\r\nfood, its digestion and its assimilation. And these organs, the organs\r\nof the digestive system, while differing in details are alike in being\r\ncomposed principally of a long tube, the alimentary canal, running\r\nthrough the body, open anteriorly for the taking in of food, and open\r\nposteriorly for the discharge of indigestible useless matter. Both\r\nalimentary canals are divided into various special regions for the\r\nperformance of the various special processes connected with the\r\ndigestion and assimilation of food. Each is adapted for the special kind\r\nof food which it is the habit of the particular animal to take. The two\r\nsets of organs are essentially alike and have the same essential\r\nfunction or life-process to perform. But this process differs in the\r\ndetails of its performance, and the organs which perform this function\r\nand which constitute the digestive system of each are modified to suit\r\nthe special habits or kind of life of the animal.\r\n\r\nBoth toad and crayfish have a heart with blood-vessels leading from\r\nit. In the case of the toad the heart is more complex than in the\r\ncrayfish, and the system of blood-vessels is far more extensive and\r\nelaborate. But the heart and blood-vessels in both animals subserve\r\nthe same purpose; their function is the circulation of the blood,\r\nthis being the means by which oxygen and food are carried to all\r\ngrowing or working parts of the body, and by which carbonic acid gas\r\nand other poisonous waste products are brought away from these parts.\r\nBut this function differs somewhat in its performance in the two\r\nanimals, and the organs which perform the function are correspondingly\r\nmodified in structural condition.\r\n\r\nBoth toad and crayfish have organs for respiration, that is, for\r\nbreathing in oxygen and breathing out carbonic acid gas. But the toad\r\ntakes its oxygen from the atmosphere about it; its respiratory organs\r\nare the lungs, the sac-like tube leading to the mouth, and the\r\nexternal openings for the ingress and exit of the gases. The crayfish,\r\nliving mostly in the water, takes its oxygen from the air which is\r\nmechanically mixed with the water. Its respiratory organs are its\r\ngills. There is a great difference, apparently, in the structural\r\nconditions of the organs of respiration in the two animals. As a\r\nmatter of fact the difference is less great than, at first sight,\r\nappears to be the case. The lungs of the toad are composed primarily\r\nof a thin membrane, in the form of a sac, richly supplied with\r\nblood-vessels. Air is brought to this thin respiratory membrane and by\r\nosmosis the oxygen passes through the membrane and through the thin\r\nwalls of the fine blood-vessels, and is taken up by the blood. At the\r\nsame time the carbonic acid gas brought by the blood to the lungs from\r\nall parts of the body is given up by it and passes through the\r\nmembranes in order to leave the body. The air comes in contact with\r\nthe respiratory membrane (which is situated inside the body) by means\r\nof a system of external openings and a conducting chamber, and by\r\nthese same openings and chamber the carbonic acid gas leaves the body.\r\nIn the crayfish the gills are nothing else than a large number of\r\nsmall flattened sacs each composed of a thin membrane richly supplied\r\nwith blood-vessels. This respiratory membrane is not, in the crayfish,\r\nsituated inside the body, but on the outer surface, although protected\r\nby being in a sort of pocket with a covering flap, and it comes into\r\nimmediate contact with the air held in the water which freely bathes\r\nthe gills. By osmosis the oxygen of this air passes in through the\r\ngill-membranes, while the carbonic acid gas brought by the blood\r\npasses out through them. Exactly the same exchange of gases is\r\naccomplished as in the toad. But because of the great difference in\r\nthe conditions of life of the toad and crayfish, one living in water,\r\nthe other living out of water, the character of the performance of the\r\nfunction of respiration, and correspondingly the structural condition\r\nof the organs performing this function, are strikingly different.\r\n\r\n=Modification of functions and structure to fit the animal to special\r\nconditions of its life.=--As has been done with the organs of\r\ndigestion, circulation, and respiration, so we might compare the other\r\norgans of the crayfish and the toad. There would be found not only\r\nmany very marked differences between organs which have the same\r\ngeneral function in the two animals, but we should find also numerous\r\norgans in the toad which are not present at all in the crayfish, and\r\nconversely; and this means, of course, that the toad can do numerous\r\nthings, perform numerous functions, which the crayfish cannot, and,\r\nconversely, that the crayfish does some things which the toad cannot.\r\nBut both of these animals agree in possessing in common the capability\r\nof performing those processes such as taking food, breathing,\r\nreproducing, etc., to which attention has been called as being\r\nindispensable to all animal life. These processes, however, are\r\nperformed by the two animals in different ways and the organs for the\r\nperformance of these processes, although at very bottom essentially\r\nalike, are in outer and superficial details of position, appearance\r\nand general structure markedly different. Animals are fitted to live\r\nin different places amid different surroundings by having their bodies\r\nmodified and the performance of their life-processes modified to suit\r\nthe special conditions of their life.\r\n\r\n=Vertebrate and invertebrate.=--In selecting the toad and the crayfish\r\nas the first animals to study and to compare with each other, we have\r\nchosen representatives of the two great groups into which the complexly\r\norganized animals are divided, viz., the group of backboned or\r\nvertebrate animals, and the group of backboneless or invertebrate\r\nanimals. To the vertebrates belong all those which have an internal bony\r\nskeleton (and a few without such a skeleton) and which have also an\r\narrangement of body-organs on the general plan of the toad's body. A\r\nconspicuous feature of this arrangement is the situation of the spinal\r\ncord or main great nerve-trunk along the back or dorsal wall of the\r\nanimal, and inside of a backbone. All the fishes, batrachians (frogs,\r\ntoads, salamanders, etc.), reptiles (snakes, lizards, alligators, etc.),\r\nbirds, and mammals (quadrupeds, whales, seals, etc.) belong to the\r\nvertebrates. The backboneless or invertebrate animals have no internal\r\nbony skeleton and have their main nerve-trunk usually along the ventral\r\nwall of the body, sometimes in a circle around the mouth, but never in a\r\nbackbone. To the invertebrates belong all insects, lobsters, crabs,\r\nclams, squids, snails, worms, starfishes and sea-urchins, corals and\r\nsponges, altogether a great host of animals, mostly small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                       AMŒBA AND PARAMŒCIUM\r\n\r\n                          LABORATORY EXERCISE\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Amœba.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--_Amœbæ_ are found in stagnant pools of\r\n    water on the dead leaves, sticks and slime at the bottom. To\r\n    obtain them, collect slime and water from various puddles in\r\n    separate bottles and take them to the laboratory. Place a small\r\n    drop of slime on a slide under a cover-glass. Examine under the\r\n    low power first and note any small transparent or opalescent\r\n    objects in the field. Examine these objects with the higher power\r\n    and note that some are mere granular jelly-like specks, which\r\n    slowly (but constantly) change their form. These are _Amœbæ_.\r\n\r\n    A teacher of zoology recommends the following method of obtaining\r\n    a large supply of _Amœbæ_: \"For rearing _Amœbæ_ place two or\r\n    three inches of sand in a common tub, which is then filled with\r\n    water and placed some feet from a north window; three or four\r\n    opened mussels, with merest trace of the mud from the stream in\r\n    which they are taken, are partially buried in the sand and a\r\n    handful of _Nitella_ and a couple of crayfish cut in two are\r\n    added; as decomposition goes on a very gentle stream is allowed\r\n    to flow into the tub, and after from two to four weeks abundant\r\n    _Amœbæ_ are to be found on the surface of the sand and in the\r\n    scum on the sides of the tub; small _Amœbæ_ appear at first, and\r\n    later the large ones.\"\r\n\r\nHaving found an _Amœba_ (fig. 5) note its irregular shape, and if it\r\nmoves actively observe its method of moving. How is this accomplished?\r\nThe viscous, jelly-like substance which composes the whole body of an\r\n_Amœba_ is called _protoplasm_. The little processes which stick out\r\nin various directions are the \"false feet\" (_pseudopodia_). Note that\r\nthe outer portion, the _ectosarc_, of the protoplasmic body is clear,\r\nwhile the inner, the _endosarc_, is more or less granular in\r\nstructure. Has _Amœba_ a definite body-wall? Do the pseudopodia\r\nprotrude only from certain parts of the body? Within the endosarc\r\nnote a clear globular spot which contracts and expands, or pulsates,\r\nmore or less regularly. This is the _contractile vacuole_. Note the\r\nsmall granules which move about within the endosarc. These are\r\nfood-particles which have been taken in through the body-wall. Note\r\nhow pseudopodia flow about food-particles in the water and how these\r\nare digested by the protoplasm. If an _Amœba_ comes into contact with\r\na particle of sand, note how it at once retreats. Note within the\r\nendosarc an oval transparent body which shows no pulsations. This is\r\nthe _nucleus_, a very complex little structure of great importance in\r\nthe make-up of _Amœba_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Amœba_ sp.; showing the forms assumed by a\r\nsingle individual in four successive changes. (From life.)]\r\n\r\nNote that _Amœba_ has no mouth or alimentary canal; no nostrils or\r\nlungs, no heart or blood-vessels, no muscles, no glands. It is an\r\nanimal body not made up of distinct organs and diverse tissues. Its\r\nwhole body is a simple minute speck of protoplasm, a single animal\r\ncell. But it takes in food, it moves, it excretes waste matter from\r\nthe body, is sensitive to the touch of surrounding objects, and, as we\r\nmay be able to see, it can reproduce itself, i.e., produce new\r\n_Amœbæ_. _Amœba_ is the simplest living animal.\r\n\r\nIt is only rarely that we can find an _Amœba_ actually reproducing.\r\nThe process, in its gross features, is very simple. First the _Amœba_\r\ndraws in all of its pseudopodia and remains dormant for a time. Next,\r\ncertain changes take place in the nucleus, which divides into equal\r\nportions, one part withdrawing to one end of the protoplasmic body,\r\nthe other to the opposite end. Soon the body protoplasm itself begins\r\nto divide into two parts, each part collecting about its own half of\r\nthe nucleus. Finally the two halves pull entirely away from each other\r\nand form two new _Amœbæ_, each like the original, but only half as\r\nlarge. This is the simplest kind of reproduction found among animals.\r\n\r\n_Amœbæ_ continue to live and multiply as long as the conditions\r\nsurrounding them are favorable. But when the pond dries up the _Amœbæ_\r\nin it would be exterminated were it not for a careful provision of\r\nnature. When the pond begins to dry up each _Amœba_ contracts its\r\npseudopodia and the protoplasm secretes a horny capsule about itself.\r\nIt is now protected from dry weather and can be blown by the winds\r\nfrom place to place until the rains begin, when it expands, throws off\r\nthe capsule and commences active life again in some new pond.\r\n\r\n    =The Slipper Animalcule= (_Paramœcium_ sp.)--_Technical\r\n    Note_.--_Paramœcia_ can be secured in most pond water where leaves\r\n    or other vegetation are decaying. However, if specimens are not\r\n    readily secured place some hay or finely cut dry clover in a glass\r\n    dish, cover with water and leave in the sun for several days. In\r\n    this mixture specimens will develop by thousands. Place a drop of\r\n    water containing _Paramœcia_ on a slide with cover-glass over it.\r\n    Using a low power, note the many small animals darting hither and\r\n    thither in the field. Run a thin mixture of cherry gum in water\r\n    under the cover-glass. In this mixture they can be kept more quiet\r\n    and be better studied.\r\n\r\nHow does _Paramœcium_ (fig. 6) differ from _Amœba_ in form and\r\nmovement? Has the body an anterior and a posterior end? The delicate,\r\nshort, thread-like processes, on the surface of the body, which beat\r\nabout very rapidly in the water are called _cilia_, and they are\r\nsimply fine prolongations of the body protoplasm. What is their\r\nfunction? Note a fine _cuticle_ covering the body. Note also many\r\nminute oval sacs lying side by side in the ectosarc. These are called\r\n_trichocysts_ and from each a fine thread can be thrust out.\r\n\r\nNote on one side, beginning at the anterior end, the _buccal groove_\r\nleading into the interior through the _gullet_. Observe also that by the\r\naction of the cilia in the buccal groove food-particles are swept into\r\nthe gullet. Rejected or waste particles are ejected from the body\r\noccasionally. Where? Note about midway of the _Paramœcium_ an ovoid body\r\nwith a smaller oval one attached to its side, the former being the\r\n_macronucleus_, the latter the _micronucleus_. Note that there are two\r\ncontractile vacuoles in the _Paramœcium;_ also that the food-vacuoles\r\nhave a definite course in their movement inside the endosarc.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of a _Paramœcium_.\r\n\r\nIn comparing _Paramœcium_ with _Amœba_ it is apparent that the body of\r\nthe first is less simple than that of the second. The definite opening\r\nfor the ingress of food, the two nuclei, the fixed cilia, and the\r\ndefinite cell-wall giving a fixed shape to the body, are all\r\nspecializations which make _Paramœcium_ more complex than _Amœba_. But\r\nthe whole body is still composed of a single cell, and there is, as in\r\n_Amœba_, no differentiation of the body-substance into different\r\ntissues, and no arrangement of body-parts as systems of organs.\r\n\r\n_Paramœcium_ may occasionally be found reproducing. This process takes\r\nplace very much as in _Amœba_. The animal remains dormant for a while,\r\nthe micronucleus then divides, the macronucleus elongates and finally\r\ndivides in two, the protoplasm of the body becomes constricted into two\r\nparts, each part massing itself about the withdrawn halves of the macro-\r\nand micro-nuclei, and lastly the whole breaks into two smaller organisms\r\nwhich grow to be like the original. After multiplication or reproduction\r\nhas gone on in this way for numerous generations (about one hundred), a\r\nfusion of two _Paramœcia_ seems necessary before further divisions take\r\nplace. This process of fusion, called _conjugation_, may be noted at\r\nsome seasons. Two _Paramœcia_ unite with their buccal grooves together,\r\npart of the macronucleus and micronucleus of each passes over to the\r\nother, and the mixed elements fuse together to form a new macro- and\r\nmicronucleus in each half. The conjugating _Paramœcia_ now separate, and\r\neach divides to form two new individuals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--_Paramœcium_ sp.; buccal groove at right.\r\n(From life.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n               THE SINGLE-CELLED ANIMAL BODY.--PROTOPLASM\r\n                              AND THE CELL\r\n\r\n\r\n=The single-celled body.=--The study of _Amœba_ and _Paramœcium_ has\r\nmade us acquainted with an animal body very different from that of the\r\ntoad or the crayfish. These extraordinarily minute animals have a body\r\nso simple in its composition, compared with the toad's, that if the\r\ntoad's body be taken for the type of the animal body, _Amœba_ might\r\nreadily be thought not to be an animal at all. The body of _Amœba_ is\r\nnot composed of organs, each with a particular function or work to\r\nperform. Whatever an _Amœba_ does is done, we may say, with its whole\r\nbody. But as we learn the things that this formless viscid speck of\r\nmatter does, we see that it is truly an animal; that it really does\r\nthose things which we have learned are the necessary life-processes of\r\nan animal. _Amœba_ takes up and digests food composed of organic\r\nparticles; it has the power of motion; it knows when its body comes in\r\ncontact with some external object, that is, it can feel or has the\r\npower of sensation. _Amœba_ takes in oxygen and gives out carbonic\r\nacid gas, and it can produce new individuals like itself, that is, it\r\nhas the power of reproduction. But for the performance of these\r\nvarious life-processes or functions it has no special parts or organs,\r\nno mouth or alimentary canal, no lungs or gills, no legs, no special\r\nreproductive organs. We have here to do with one of the \"simplest\r\nanimals.\" With a minute, organless, soft speck of viscous matter\r\ncalled protoplasm for a body, the simplest structural condition to be\r\nfound among living beings, _Amœba_ nevertheless is capable of\r\nperforming, in the simplest way in which they may be performed, those\r\nprocesses which are essential to animal life.\r\n\r\n_Paramœcium_ has a body a little less simple than _Amœba_. The\r\nfood-particles are taken into the body always at a certain spot; this\r\nmight be spoken of as a mouth. And the body has some special\r\nlocomotory organs, if they may be so called, in the presence of the\r\ncilia. The body, too, has a definite shape or form. But, as in _Amœba_\r\nthere is no alimentary canal, nor nervous system, nor respiratory\r\nsystem, nor reproductive system. The whole body feels and breathes and\r\ntakes part in reproduction.\r\n\r\nA long jump has been made from the toad and crayfish to _Amœba_ and\r\n_Paramœcium_; from the complex to the simplest animals. But, as will\r\nlater be seen, the great difference between the bodies of these\r\nsimplest animals and those of the highly complex ones is only a\r\ndifference of degree; there are animals of all grades and stages of\r\nstructural condition connecting the simplest with the most complex.\r\nWhen animals are studied systematically, as it is called, we begin\r\nwith the simplest and proceed from them to the slightly complex, from\r\nthese to the more complex, and finally to the most complex. There are\r\nhundreds of thousands of different kinds of animals, and they\r\nrepresent all the degrees of complexity which lie between the extremes\r\nwe have so far studied.\r\n\r\n=The cell.=--The characteristic thing about the body of _Amœba_ and\r\n_Paramœcium_ and the other \"simplest animals\"--for there are many\r\nmembers of the group of \"simplest animals,\" or Protozoa--is that it is\r\ncomposed, for the animal's whole lifetime, of a single cell. A cell is\r\nthe structural unit of the animal body. As will be learned in the\r\nnext exercise, the bodies of all other animals except the Protozoa,\r\nthe simplest animals, are composed of many cells. These cells are of\r\nmany kinds, but the simplest kind of animal cell is that shown by the\r\nbody of an _Amœba_, a tiny speck of viscous, nearly colorless\r\nprotoplasm without fixed form. The protoplasm composing the cell is\r\ndifferentiated to form two parts or regions of the cell, an inner\r\ndenser part, called the nucleus, and an outer clearer part, called the\r\ncytoplasm. Sometimes, as in the _Paramœcium_, the cell is enclosed by\r\na cell-wall which may be simply a denser outer layer of the cytoplasm,\r\nor may be a thin membrane secreted by the protoplasm. Thus the cell is\r\nnot what its name might lead us to expect, typically cellular in\r\ncharacter; that is, it is not (or only rarely is) a tiny sac or box of\r\nsymmetrical shape. While the cell is composed essentially of\r\nprotoplasm, yet it may contain certain so-called cell-products, small\r\nquantities of various substances produced by the life-processes of the\r\nprotoplasm. These cell-products are held in the protoplasmic body-mass\r\nof the cell, and may consist of droplets of water or oil or resin, or\r\ntiny particles of starch or pigment, etc. The cell cannot be said to\r\nbe composed of organs, because the word organ, as it is commonly used\r\nin the study of an animal, is understood to mean a part of the animal\r\nbody which is composed of many cells. But the single cell can be\r\nsomewhat differentiated into parts or special regions, each part or\r\nspecial region being especially associated with some one of the\r\nlife-processes. In _Paramœcium_, for example, the food is always taken\r\nin through the so-called mouth-opening; the fine protoplasmic cilia\r\nenable the cell to swim freely in the water, the waste products of the\r\nbody are always cast out through a certain part, and so on. But this\r\nis a very simple sort of differentiation, and the whole body is only\r\none of those structural units, the cells, of which so many are\r\nincluded in the body of any one of the complex animals.\r\n\r\n=Protoplasm.=--The protoplasm, which is the essential substance of the\r\ntypical animal cell and hence of the whole animal body, is a substance\r\nof very complex chemical and physical make-up. No chemist has yet been\r\nable to determine its exact chemical constitution, and the microscope\r\nhas so far been unable to reveal certainly its physical characters.\r\nThe most important thing known about the chemical constitution of\r\nprotoplasm is that there are always present in it certain complex\r\nalbuminous substances which are never found in inorganic bodies. And\r\nit is certain that it is on the presence of these substances that the\r\npower possessed by protoplasm of performing the fundamental\r\nlife-processes depends. Protoplasm is the primitive physical basis of\r\nlife, but it is the presence of the complex albuminous substances in\r\nit that makes it so.\r\n\r\nThe physical constitution of protoplasm seems to be that of a viscous\r\nliquid containing many fine globules of a liquid of different density\r\nand numerous larger globules of a liquid of still other density. Some\r\nnaturalists believe the fine globules to be solid grains, while still\r\nothers believe that numerous fine threads of dense protoplasm lie\r\ncoiled and tangled in the clearer, viscous protoplasm. But the little\r\nwe know of the physical structure of protoplasm throws almost no light\r\non the remarkable properties of this fundamental life-substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                   CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF THE TOAD (OR\r\n                                 FROG)\r\n\r\n                          LABORATORY EXERCISE\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The blood.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--The blood of a frog can be studied\r\n    as it flows through the small vessels in the membranes between the\r\n    toes while the animal is alive. Place a frog on a small flat board\r\n    which has had a hole cut near one end, and with a piece of cloth\r\n    bind it to the board. Spread the web between two toes over the\r\n    hole in the board and keep it in place with pins. This done,\r\n    examine the distended web under the compound microscope first with\r\n    low then with higher power, and observe the blood-vessels and the\r\n    blood circulating in them. For a further study of the blood kill a\r\n    toad or frog and place a drop of the blood on a slide with a\r\n    cover-glass over it.\r\n\r\nPut the prepared slide under the microscope and note that the blood,\r\nwhich as seen with the unaided eye appears to be a red fluid, is made\r\nup of a great many yellowish elliptical disks or _cells_, the\r\n_blood-corpuscles_, floating in a liquid, the _blood-plasma_. Here and\r\nthere you may notice _amœboid blood-corpuscles_. These are\r\nirregular-shaped cells which move about by thrusting out pseudopodia.\r\nThey look like some of the unicellular animals, as the _Amœba_. Can\r\nyou distinguish a nucleus and cell-wall in the blood-cells?\r\n\r\nMake drawings of these blood-cells.\r\n\r\n    =The skin.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Keep a live toad or frog in water\r\n    for some time and note if its skin becomes loose or begins to slip\r\n    away. If the outer skin, epidermis, comes off, take some of the\r\n    shed skin and wash it in water, then stain for three or four\r\n    minutes in a solution of methyl-green and acetic acid (see p.\r\n    451). Cut the pieces of stained skin into small bits and examine\r\n    one of these under the microscope.\r\n\r\nWith the low power of the microscope you will note that the skin is\r\nmade up of a great many flat _cells_ placed edge to edge. Each one has\r\nits cell-wall and a central darkly stained nucleus.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of a portion of the toad's skin.\r\n\r\n    =The liver.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Cut through the fresh liver of a\r\n    toad, and with a knife-blade scrape from the cut surface some of\r\n    the liver-cells and place them on a slide with cover-glass.\r\n\r\nExamine under the microscope and observe many polygonal _cells_. Place\r\nsome of the methyl-green acetic stain under the cover-glass and note,\r\nafter the cells are stained, that they have definite boundaries and a\r\ncentral nucleus.\r\n\r\nDraw some of these scattered liver-cells.\r\n\r\n    =The muscles.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Take a piece of intestine from a\r\n    freshly killed toad, wash it thoroughly and place it in a\r\n    concentrated solution of salicylic acid in 70% alcohol for 24 hours,\r\n    then gradually heat until about the boiling-point, when the muscles\r\n    will fall to pieces. Transfer the preparation to a watch-crystal and\r\n    tease small bits of isolated muscle with dissecting-needles. Place\r\n    some of the teased muscle-fibres on a slide, cover with cover-glass,\r\n    and add a drop of the methyl-green acetic acid.\r\n\r\nNote the small spindle-shaped _muscle-fibres_. Each one of these\r\nfibres is a _cell_ possessing all of the structures common to cells,\r\nnamely, cell-wall, nucleus, etc.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of a few isolated fibres of muscle.\r\n\r\nFrom this study of some of the tissues in a toad it will be noted that\r\nin the first case we had in the blood separate cells which moved about\r\nfreely in the plasma. In the second case, that of the epidermis, the\r\ncells are fixed edge to edge, thus forming a thin tissue; while in the\r\nthird and fourth cases, that of the liver and muscle, the cells are not\r\nonly placed edge to edge, but aggregated into vast masses or bundles,\r\nin one case to form the liver and in the other case a muscle. The entire\r\nbody of the toad is built up of a colony of simple units (cells)\r\ncombined in various forms to make all the various tissues and organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n             THE MANY-CELLED ANIMAL BODY.--DIFFERENTIATION\r\n                              OF THE CELL\r\n\r\n\r\n=The many-celled animal body.=--In the study of certain of the tissues\r\nand organs of the toad we have learned that the body of this animal is\r\ncomposed of many cells, thousands and thousands of these microscopic\r\nstructural units being combined to form the whole toad. This\r\nmany-celled or multicellular condition of the body is true of all the\r\nanimals except the simplest, the unicellular Protozoa. Corals,\r\nstarfishes, worms, clams, crabs, insects, fishes, frogs, reptiles,\r\nbirds, and mammals, all the various kinds of animals in which the body\r\nis composed of organs and tissues, agree in the multicellular\r\ncharacter of the body, and may be grouped together and called the\r\nmany-celled animals in contrast to the one-celled animals. This\r\ndivision is one which is recognized by many systematic zoologists as\r\nbeing more truly primary or fundamental than the division of animals\r\ninto Vertebrates and Invertebrates. The one-celled animals are called\r\nProtozoa, and the many-celled animals Metazoa.\r\n\r\n=Differentiation of the cell.=--It is apparent at first glance that\r\nthe cells which compose the body of a many-celled animal are not like\r\nthe simple primitive cell which makes up the body of the _Amœba_, nor\r\nare they like the more complexly arranged cell of the _Paramœcium_.\r\nNor are they all like each other. The cells in the toad's blood are of\r\ntwo kinds, the white blood-cells, which are very like the body of\r\n_Amœba_, and the elliptical disk-like red blood-cells. The cells\r\ncomposing the muscles are, moreover, like neither kind of blood-cells,\r\nand the cells of which the liver is composed are not like the cells of\r\nthe muscles. That is, there are many different kinds of cells in the\r\nbody of a many-celled animal. While the single cell which composes the\r\nwhole body of the _Amœba_ is able to do all the things necessary to\r\nmaintain life, the various cells in the body of a complex animal are\r\ndifferentiated or specialized, certain cells devoting themselves to a\r\ncertain function or special work, and others to other special\r\nfunctions. For example, the cells which compose the organs of the\r\nnervous system, the brain, ganglia, and nerves, devote themselves\r\nalmost exclusively to the function of sensation, and they are\r\nespecially modified for this purpose. The highly specialized\r\nnerve-cells resemble very little the primitive generalized body-cell\r\nof _Amœba_. The muscle-cells of the complex animal body have developed\r\nto a high degree that power of contraction which is possessed, though\r\nin but slight degree, by _Amœba_. These muscle-cells have for their\r\nspecial function this one of contraction, and massed together in great\r\nnumbers they form the strongly contractile muscular tissue and muscles\r\nof the body on which the animal's power of motion depends. The cells\r\nwhich line certain parts of the alimentary canal are the ones on which\r\nthe function of digestion chiefly rests. And so we might continue our\r\nsurvey of the whole complex body. The point of it all is that the\r\nthousands of cells which compose the many-celled animal body are\r\ndifferentiated and specialized; that is, have become changed or\r\nmodified from the generalized primitive amœboid condition, so that\r\neach kind of cell is devoted to some special work or function and has\r\na special structural character fitting it for its special function. In\r\nthe Protozoan body the single cell can perform and does perform all\r\nthe functions or processes necessary to the life of the animal. In the\r\nMetazoan body each cell performs, in co-operation with many other\r\nsimilar cells, some one special function or process. The total work of\r\nall the cells is the living of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                                 HYDRA\r\n\r\n                          LABORATORY EXERCISE\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--_Hydra_ lives in fresh water, attached to stones,\r\n    sticks, or decayed leaves. It can be found in most open\r\n    fresh-water ponds not too stagnant, often attached to _Chara_.\r\n    There are two species occurring commonly, _H. viridis_, the green\r\n    _Hydra_, and _H. fuscus_, the brown or flesh-colored _Hydra_. Both\r\n    are very small forms and have to be looked for carefully.\r\n    Specimens should be brought to the laboratory, put into a large\r\n    dish of water and left in the light. _Hydra_ is best studied\r\n    alive. Place a living specimen attached to a bit of weed in a\r\n    watch-crystal filled with water or on a slide with plenty of water\r\n    and examine with the low power of the microscope.\r\n\r\nNote the cylindrical body (fig. 7, _A_, _B_) with its flat basal\r\nattachment and _radial tentacles_ (varying in number) which crown the\r\nupper end and surround the centrally located _mouth_. Note the movements\r\nof _Hydra_, its powers of contraction, and method of taking in food.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--To feed _Hydra_, place very small \"water-fleas\"\r\n    (_Daphnia_ sp.) in the water with it.\r\n\r\nObserve the method by which \"water-fleas\" are taken into the mouth.\r\nFood is caught on stinging cells (to be studied later) and conveyed to\r\nthe mouth by the tentacles. Note that the cylindrical body encloses a\r\ncavity, the _digestive cavity_. How is this connected with the\r\nexterior? If _Hydra_ captures prey too large or is no longer hungry,\r\nthe prey is released.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--A, _Hydra fusca_, with expanded body and a\r\nbudding individual; B, _H. fusca_, contracted; C, _H. fusca_, part of\r\nouter surface of a tentacle, greatly magnified.

Are the\r\ncells in the tentacles all alike? Note nodule-like projections above\r\nsome of the cells; these are _stinging cells_, or _cnidoblasts_. In\r\nsome cases a small hair-like process, the trigger hair or _cnidocil_,\r\nmay be seen projecting above the surface of the cell. Note in some of\r\nthe tentacles dark-colored particles. These are food-particles which\r\nhave been taken through the mouth into the digestive cavity and have\r\npassed thence into the tentacles. The central digestive cavity\r\ncommunicates freely with the cavities in the tentacles, for the\r\ntentacles are merely evaginations of the body-wall.\r\n\r\nMake drawings of the _Hydra_ expanded and of the same individual\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--From the preparation which you have under the\r\n    microscope pull out the slips of paper, thus letting the cover-glass\r\n    drop down on the specimen. With a small pipette put a drop of\r\n    anilin-acetic stain (see p. 451) on the slide at one side of the\r\n    cover-glass and with a piece of filter-paper draw the water through\r\n    from the other side of the cover-glass. When the stain is diffused\r\n    press down the cover-glass gently and examine the tentacles first\r\n    under a low power of the microscope, then under a high one.\r\n\r\nNote the distortion that the animal has undergone through the action\r\nof the reagent. Observe the cnidoblasts of the tentacles and note that\r\nmany of them have thrown out long whip-like processes (fig. 7, _C_).\r\nOn what parts of the body do the cnidoblasts occur? Carefully examine\r\none of the cnidoblasts which has been discharged and note a clear\r\ntransparent bag-like structure within, the _nematocyst_, to which is\r\nattached the long whip-like process. In another cnidoblast cell which\r\nhas not been discharged note that the whip-like process is coiled\r\nabout inside of the bag-like structure. The whole apparatus is like\r\nthe inturned finger of a glove which can be blown out by pressure from\r\nthe inside. The mechanism is simple. The cnidocil or trigger-hair is\r\ntouched by some animal, an impulse is conveyed to the delicate fibres\r\ninterspersed among the cells (nerve-cells) which stimulate the\r\ncnidoblast cell, whereupon there is a contraction of the contents and,\r\nthe cnidoblast being compressed, the inverted whip-like process turns\r\nwrong side out and impales the animal on its points or barbs.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The teacher should be provided with microscopical\r\n    sections, both transverse and longitudinal, of the _Hydra_ stained\r\n    in some good general stain (hæmatoxylin or borax carmine). If the\r\n    teacher has no means of making such preparations, they may be\r\n    procured from dispensers of microscopical supplies.\r\n\r\nFrom the cross-section of the _Hydra_ make out the general structure\r\nof the body. Note that it is a hollow cylinder consisting of two\r\nwell-defined layers of cells, an outside _ectoderm_ layer and an inner\r\n_endoderm_ layer. Between these two is yet another thin non-cellular\r\nlayer called the _mesoglœa_.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that _Hydra_ is made up of two layers of cells,\r\nthe outer ectoderm or skin, which is specialized to perform the office\r\nof capturing prey as well as that of protection, and the inner\r\nendoderm, which surrounds the digestive cavity and performs the\r\nfunction of digestion. The endoderm lines the body-cavity, particles\r\ntaken in as food being digested by certain digestive cells which\r\nthrust out amœboid processes and ingest particles of food. Other cells\r\nin the endoderm have long flagellate processes which vibrate back and\r\nforth in the digestive cavity, thereby creating currents in the water\r\ncontaining food-particles.\r\n\r\nNote, in a cross-section, that there are small ovoid or cuboid cells\r\nat the bases of the large ectoderm cells. These are the _interstitial\r\ncells_. Some of the interstitial cells become modified and pushed up\r\nbetween the ectoderm cells to form cnidoblast cells. Many of the\r\nendoderm as well as ectoderm cells have muscle-processes which spread\r\nout from the base of the cell and which serve to contract and expand\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--In the specimens which have been collected\r\n    perhaps two methods of reproduction will be observed. Place\r\n    healthy _Hydræ_ in a wide-mouthed jar in the sunlight with plenty\r\n    of water and food. In a few days active budding will take place.\r\n\r\nObserve the method of reproduction in _Hydra_. Commonly the parent\r\nproduces small buds, which at first are only evaginations of the\r\nbody-wall, but which later develop tentacles and a mouth of their own.\r\nSubsequently the bud becomes constricted at the base, separates from\r\nthe parent, and the young _Hydra_ begins a distinct existence.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of reproduction takes place which, in distinction from the\r\nasexual method just mentioned, is called sexual reproduction. This last\r\nis the method common to most of the higher organisms. You may note that\r\nin some _Hydræ_ there is a swelling or bulging of the ectoderm of the\r\nbody-wall in the region just below the tentacles. These are the\r\n_sperm-glands_. Within these are produced sperm-cells which break away\r\nin great clusters to fertilize the ova, or eggs. Note a larger bulging\r\nof the body-wall nearer the lower end of the body which, under high\r\npower, has a granular appearance. This is the _egg-gland_, in which\r\ndevelops a single _ovum_ or _egg_. The ovum breaks from its covering and\r\nis fertilized by sperm-cells from another individual. In forms like\r\n_Hydra_, where both sexes are represented in a single individual, the\r\norganism is termed _monœcious_ or _hermaphroditic_. In connection with\r\nreproduction Chapter XIII should be studied.\r\n\r\nAn instructive experiment can be performed by cutting a _Hydra_ into\r\ntwo or more parts, when (usually) each of the various parts will\r\ndevelop into a complete _Hydræ_. This process may be called\r\nreproduction by fission, but it rarely occurs naturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                    THE SIMPLEST MANY-CELLED ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cell differentiation and body organization in Hydra.=--From the\r\nexamination of _Hydra_ we have learned that there are true many-celled\r\nanimals which are much less complex in structure than the toad and\r\ncrayfish. The body of _Hydra_, like the body of the toad, is composed of\r\nmany cells, but these cells are of only a few different kinds; that is,\r\nshow but little differentiation. There is relatively little division of\r\nthe body into distinct organs. Still, certain parts of the body devote\r\nthemselves principally to certain particular functions. Thus all the\r\nfood is taken in through the single \"mouth-opening\" at the apical free\r\nend of the cylindrical body, and there are certain organs, the\r\ntentacles, whose special business or function it is to find and seize\r\nfood and to convey it to the mouth. After the food is taken into the\r\ncylindrical body-cavity it is digested by special cells which line the\r\ncavity. Some of these cells are unusually large, and each contains one\r\nor more contractile vacuoles. From the free ends of these cells, the\r\nends which are next to the body-cavity, project pseudopods or flagella.\r\nThese protoplasmic processes are constantly changing their form and\r\nnumber. In addition to these large sub-amœboid cells there are, in this\r\ninner layer of cells lining the body-cavity, and especially abundant\r\nnear the base or bottom of the cavity, many long, narrow, granular\r\ncells. These are gland-cells which secrete a digestive fluid. The food\r\ncaptured by the tentacles and taken in through the mouth-opening\r\ndisintegrates in the body-cavity, or digestive cavity as it may be\r\ncalled. The digestive fluid secreted by the gland-cells acts upon it so\r\nthat it becomes broken into small parts. These particles are seized by\r\nthe projecting pseudopods of the sub-amœboid cells and taken into the\r\nbody-protoplasm of these cells. The cells of the outer layer of the body\r\ndo not take food directly, but receive nourishment only by means of and\r\nthrough the cells of the inner layer. The body-cavity of _Hydra_ is a\r\nvery simple special organ of digestion.\r\n\r\nIn the outer layer of cells there are some specially large cells whose\r\ninner ends are extended as narrow pointed prolongations directed at\r\nright angles with the rest of the cell. These processes are very\r\ncontractile and are called muscle-processes. Each one is simply a\r\nspecially contractile continuation of the protoplasm of the cell-body.\r\nThere are also in this layer some small cells very irregular in shape\r\nand provided with unusually large nuclei. These cells are more\r\nirritable or sensitive than the others and are called nerve-cells. We\r\nhave thus in _Hydra_ the beginnings of muscular organs and of\r\nnerve-organs. But how simple and unformed compared with the muscular\r\nand nervous systems of the toad and crayfish! There is no circulatory\r\nsystem, nor are there any special organs of respiration.\r\n\r\nBut _Hydra_ is far in advance of _Amœba_ or _Paramœcium_. Its body is\r\ncomposed of thousands of distinct cells. Some of these cells devote\r\nthemselves especially to food-taking, some especially to the digestion\r\nof food; some are specially contractile, and on them the movements of\r\nthe body depend, while others are specially irritable or sensitive,\r\nand on them the body depends for knowledge of the contact of prey or\r\nenemies. In the cnidoblast cells, those with the stinging threads,\r\nthere is a very wide departure from the simple primitive type of\r\ncells. There is in _Hydra_ a manifest differentiation of the cells\r\ninto various kinds of cells. The beginnings of distinct tissues and\r\norgans are indicated.\r\n\r\n=Degrees in cell differentiation and body organization.=--In the study\r\nof the cellular constitution of the tissues and organs of the toad, we\r\nfound to what a high degree the differentiation of the cells may\r\nattain, and in the study of the anatomy of the toad we found how\r\nthoroughly these differentiated cells may be combined and organized\r\ninto body-parts or organs. The body of the toad is made up of distinct\r\norgans, each composed of highly differentiated or specialized cells.\r\nThe body of _Hydra_ is composed of cells for the most part only\r\nslightly differentiated and hardly recognizably grouped or combined\r\ninto organs. These two conditions are the extremes in the\r\nbody-structure of the many-celled animals. Between them is a host of\r\nintermediate conditions of cell differentiation and body organization.\r\nWhen we come to the study of other members of the great branch of\r\nsimple many-celled animals to which _Hydra_ belongs (see Chapter\r\nXVII), it will be found that some of them show a slight advance in\r\ncomplexity beyond _Hydra_. Higher in the scale of animal life the\r\nforms will be found still more and more complex, with ever-increasing\r\ndifferentiation of the cells, with the combination of the\r\ndifferentiated cells into distinct organs, and the co-ordination of\r\norgans into systems of organs up to the extreme shown by the birds and\r\nmammals. And hand in hand with this increasing complexity of structure\r\ngoes ever-increasing complexity or specialization of function.\r\nBreathing is a simple function or process with _Hydra_, where each\r\nbody-cell takes up oxygen for itself, but it is a complex business\r\nwith the toad, or with a bird or mammal, where certain complex\r\nstructures, the lungs and accessory parts, and the heart,\r\nblood-vessels and blood all work together to distribute oxygen to all\r\nparts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                        DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOAD\r\n\r\n                     FIELD AND LABORATORY EXERCISE\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--As the work of this chapter, or some similar work\r\n    in getting acquainted with the postembryonic development of a\r\n    many-celled animal, should be done early in the course, and as\r\n    most schools open in the fall, it will perhaps be impossible to\r\n    make this first study of development from live specimens in the\r\n    field. In such case the examination of a series of prepared\r\n    specimens, previously obtained by the teacher, must be resorted\r\n    to. In the spring the development of several kinds of animals,\r\n    including the toad, can be studied from live specimens in the\r\n    field or in breeding-cages and aquaria in the laboratory. The eggs\r\n    of the toad may be found in April and May (the toads are heard\r\n    trilling at egg-laying time) in ponds. The eggs look like the\r\n    heads of black pins, and are in single rows in long strings of\r\n    transparent jelly, which are usually wound around sticks or\r\n    plant-stems at the bottom of the pond near the shore. Bring some\r\n    of these strings into the schoolroom and keep them in water in\r\n    shallow dishes. Keep them in the light, but not in direct\r\n    sunlight. In the dishes put some small stones and mud from the\r\n    pond, arranging them in a slope, thus making different depths of\r\n    water. Stones with green algæ on should be selected, for algæ are\r\n    the food of the tadpoles. The eggs will hatch in two or three\r\n    days, and if too many tadpoles are not kept in the dish, and the\r\n    little aquarium be well cared for, the whole postembryonic\r\n    development of the toad can be well observed. For the study of the\r\n    development from prepared specimens the teacher should have a\r\n    complete series of stages from egg to adult toad in alcohol. The\r\n    specimens may be examined by the students in connection with a\r\n    talk from the teacher on the life-history of the toad.\r\n\r\nIf the study is made from prepared specimens, make drawings of\r\negg-strings, and of a single egg magnified and shaded to indicate its\r\ncolor. Draw each specimen of the series of tadpoles, noting in the\r\nyoungest the presence of gills and tail and absence of legs and eyes;\r\nin the older the appearance of eyes, the shrivelling of the gills,\r\nshrinking of the tail and development of legs; in the still older the\r\ncharacteristic shape, in miniature, of the adult toad.\r\n\r\nIn observing the course of development of the living specimens there\r\nshould be made, in addition to the drawings, notes showing the\r\nduration of the egg stage, and the time elapsing between all important\r\nchanges (as seen externally) in the body of the young. Observations\r\nand notes on the general behavior of tadpoles should also be made;\r\nnote the swimming, the feeding, the gradual leaving of the water, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the easily seen external changes in the body, very\r\nimportant ones in the internal organs take place during development.\r\nPerhaps the most important of these concerns the lungs. The young\r\ngilled toad breathes as a fish does, but gradually its gills are lost,\r\nwhile at the same time lungs develop and the tadpole comes to the\r\nsurface to breathe air like any lunged aquatic animal. The toad on\r\nleaving the water changes its diet from vegetable to animal food; a\r\ntadpole feeds on aquatic algæ; a toad preys on insects. Correlated\r\nwith the change in habit, the intestine during development undergoes\r\nsome marked changes, becoming relatively diminished in length.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the development of the toad see Gage's \"Life-history\r\nof a Toad\" or Hodge's \"The Common Toad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n            MULTIPLICATION AND DEVELOPMENT.--MULTIPLICATION\r\n                         OF ONE-CELLED ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Multiplication.=--We know that any living animal has parents; that\r\nis, has been produced by other animals which may still be living or be\r\nnow dead or, as with _Amœba_, may have changed, by division, into new\r\nindividuals. Individuals die, but before death, they produce other\r\nindividuals like themselves. If they did not, their kind or species\r\nwould die with them. This production of new animals constantly going\r\non is called the reproduction or multiplication of animals. The\r\nprocess is well called multiplication, because each female animal\r\nnormally produces more than one new individual. She may produce only\r\none at a time, one a year, as many of the sea-birds do or as the\r\nelephant does, but she lives many years. Or she may produce hundreds,\r\nor thousands, or even millions of young in a very short time. A\r\nlobster lays 10,000 eggs at a time. Nearly nine millions of eggs have\r\nbeen taken from the body of a thirty-pound female codfish. As a matter\r\nof fact but very, very few of these eggs produce new animals which\r\nreach maturity. From the 10,000 eggs produced by the lobster each year\r\nan average of but two new mature lobsters is produced. There is always\r\na struggle for food and for place going on among animals, for many\r\nmore are produced than there are food and room for, and so of all the\r\nnew or young animals which are born the great majority are killed\r\nbefore they reach maturity. In a later chapter more attention will be\r\ngiven to this great struggle for life.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding paragraph it has been stated that \"we know that any\r\nliving animal has parents; that is, has been produced by other animals\r\nwhich may still be living or be now dead.\" This is a statement,\r\nhowever, which has found complete acceptance only in modern times. It\r\nis a familiar fact that a new kitten comes into the world only through\r\nbeing born; that it is the offspring of parents of its kind. But we\r\nmay not be personally familiar with the fact that a new starfish comes\r\ninto the world only as the production of parent starfish, or that a\r\nnew earthworm can be produced only by other earthworms. But\r\nnaturalists have proved these statements. All life comes from life;\r\nall organisms are produced by other organisms. And new individuals are\r\nproduced by other individuals of the same kind. That these statements\r\nare true all modern observations and investigations of the origin of\r\nnew individuals prove. But in the days of the earlier naturalists the\r\nlife of the microscopic organisms like _Amœba_ and _Paramœcium_, and\r\neven that of many of the larger but unfamiliar animals, was shrouded\r\nin mystery. And various and strange beliefs were held regarding the\r\norigin of new individuals.\r\n\r\n=Spontaneous generation.=--The ancients believed that many animals\r\nwere spontaneously generated. The early naturalists thought that flies\r\narose by spontaneous generation from the decaying matter of dead\r\nanimals. Frogs and many insects were thought to be generated\r\nspontaneously from mud, and horse-hairs in water were thought to\r\nchange into water-snakes. But such beliefs were easily shown to be\r\nbased on error, and have been long discarded by zoologists. But the\r\nbelief that the microscopic organisms, such as bacteria and infusoria,\r\nwere spontaneously generated in stagnant water or decaying organic\r\nliquids was held by some naturalists until very recent times. And it\r\nwas not so easy to disprove the assertions of such believers. If some\r\nwater in which there are apparently no living organisms, however\r\nminute, be allowed to stand for a few days, it will come to swarm with\r\nmicroscopic plants and animals. Any organic liquid, as a broth or a\r\nvegetable infusion, exposed to the air for a short time becomes foul\r\nthrough the presence of innumerable microscopic organisms. But it has\r\nbeen certainly proved that these organisms are not spontaneously\r\nproduced in the water or organic fluid. A few of them enter the water\r\nfrom the air, in which there are always greater or less numbers of\r\nspores of microscopic organisms. These spores germinate quickly when\r\nthey fall into water or some organic liquid, and the rapid succession\r\nof generations soon gives rise to the hosts of bacteria and one-celled\r\nanimals which infest all standing water. If all the active organisms\r\nand inactive spores in a glass of water are killed by boiling the\r\nwater, and this sterilized water be put into a sterilized glass, and\r\nthis glass be so well closed that germs or spores cannot pass from the\r\nair without into the sterilized liquid, no living animals will ever\r\nappear in it. We know of no instance of the spontaneous generation of\r\nanimals, and all the animals whose life-history we know are produced\r\nby other animals of the same kind.\r\n\r\n=Simplest multiplication and development.=--The simplest method of\r\nmultiplication and the simplest kind of development shown among animals\r\nare exhibited by such simple animals as _Amœba_ and _Paramœcium_. The\r\nproduction of new individuals is accomplished in _Amœba_ by a simple\r\ndivision or fission of its body (a single cell) into two practically\r\nequivalent parts. An _Amœba_ which has grown for some time contracts all\r\nof its finger-like processes, the pseudopodia, and its body becomes\r\nconstricted. This constriction or fissure increases inwards so that the\r\nbody is soon divided fairly in two. There are now two _Amœbæ_, each half\r\nthe size of the original one; each, indeed, actually one-half of the\r\noriginal one. The original _Amœba_ was the parent; the two halves of it\r\nare the young. Each of the young possesses all of the characteristics\r\nand powers of the parent; each can move, eat, feel, grow, and reproduce\r\nby fission. The only change necessary for the young or new _Amœba_ to\r\nbecome like its parent, is that of simple growth to a size about twice\r\nits present size. The development here is reduced to a minimum. Just as\r\nthe simplest animals perform the other life-processes, such as taking\r\nand digesting food, breathing and feeling, in an extremely primitive\r\nsimple way, so do they perform the necessary life-process of\r\nreproduction or multiplication in the simplest way shown among animals.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Paramœcium_ the process of multiplication is slightly\r\nmore complex than that of _Amœba_ in the fact that sometimes before\r\nthe simple fission of the body takes place the interesting phenomenon\r\nof conjugation occurs. _Paramœcium_ may reproduce itself for many\r\ngenerations by simple fission, but a generation finally appears in\r\nwhich conjugation takes place. Two individuals come together and each\r\nexchanges with the other a part of its nucleus. Then the two\r\nindividuals separate and each divides into two. The result of the\r\nconjugation, or the coming together, of two individuals with mutual\r\ninterchange of nuclear substance is to give to the new _Paramœcia_\r\nproduced by the conjugating individuals a body which contains part of\r\nthe body-substance of two distinct individuals. If the two conjugating\r\nindividuals differ at all--and they always do differ, because no two\r\nindividual animals, although belonging to the same species, are\r\nexactly alike--the new individual, made up of parts of each of them,\r\nwill differ slightly from both. Nature seems intent on making every\r\nnew individual differ slightly from the individual which precedes it.\r\nAnd the method of multiplication which Nature has adopted to produce\r\nthe result is the method which we have seen exhibited in its simplest\r\nform in the case of _Paramœcium_--the method of having two individuals\r\ntake part in the production of a new one.\r\n\r\nThe development of the new _Paramœcia_ is a little more complex than\r\nthat of _Amœba_. Not only must the new _Paramœcium_ grow to the size\r\nof the original one, but it must develop those slight, but apparent,\r\nmodifications of the parts of its body which we can recognize in the\r\nfull-grown, fully developed _Paramœcium_ individual. A new\r\nmouth-opening must develop on the new individual formed of the hinder\r\nhalf of the original _Paramœcium_ and new cilia must be developed.\r\nThus there is a slight advance in complexity of development, just as\r\nthere is in complexity of structure in _Paramœcium_ as compared with\r\n_Amœba_. In the many-celled animals this complexity of development is\r\ncarried to an extreme.\r\n\r\n=Birth and hatching.=--When a young animal is born alive, it usually\r\nresembles in appearance and structure the parent, although of course\r\nit is much smaller, and requires always a certain time to complete its\r\ndevelopment and become mature. A young kangaroo or opossum is carried\r\nfor some time after its birth in an external pouch on the mother's\r\nbody and is a very helpless animal. A young kitten is born with eyes\r\nnot yet opened and must be fed by the mother for several weeks. On the\r\nother hand young Rocky Mountain sheep are able to run about swiftly\r\nwithin a few hours after birth.\r\n\r\nMost animals appear first as eggs laid by the mother. This is true of\r\nthe birds, the reptiles, the fishes, the insects, and most of the\r\nhosts of invertebrate animals. This egg may be cared for by the parent\r\nas with the birds, or simply deposited in a safe place as with most\r\ninsects, or perhaps dropped without care into the water as with most\r\nmarine invertebrates. The young animal which issues from the egg may\r\nat the time of its hatching resemble the parent in appearance and\r\nstructural character (although always much smaller) as with the birds,\r\nsome of the insects, and many of the other animals. Or it may issue in\r\na so-called _larval_ condition, in which it resembles the parent but\r\nslightly or not at all, as is the case with the gill-bearing, legless,\r\ntailed tadpole of the frog or the crawling, wingless, wormlike\r\ncaterpillar of the butterfly, or the maggot of the house-fly.\r\n\r\n=Life-history.=--Any animal which hatches from an egg has undergone a\r\nlonger or shorter period of development within the egg-shell before\r\nhatching. The development of an animal from first germ-cell to the time\r\nit leaves the egg, for example, the development of the embryo chick from\r\nthe first cell to time of hatching, is called its _embryonic_\r\ndevelopment; and the development from then on, for example, that of the\r\nchick to adult hen or rooster, or that of tadpole to frog, is called the\r\n_post-embryonic_ development. Beginning students of animals cannot study\r\nthe embryonic development (_embryology_) of animals readily, but they\r\ncan in many cases easily follow the course of the post-embryonic\r\ndevelopment, and this study will always be interesting and valuable.\r\nWhen the \"life-history\" of an animal is spoken of in this book, or other\r\nelementary text-book of zoology, it is the history of the life of the\r\nanimal from the time of its birth or hatching to and through adult\r\ncondition that is meant, not the complete life-history from beginning\r\nsingle egg-cell to the end. In all of the study of the different kinds\r\nof animals to which the rest of this book is devoted, attention will be\r\npaid to their life-history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n                           SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                     THE CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Basis and significance of classification.=--It is the common\r\nknowledge of all of us that animals are classified: that is, that the\r\ndifferent kinds are arranged in the mind of the zoologist and in the\r\nbooks of natural history, in various groups, and that these various\r\ngroups are of different rank or degree of comprehensiveness. A group\r\nof high rank or great comprehensiveness includes groups of lower rank,\r\nand each of these includes groups of still lower rank, and so on, for\r\nseveral degrees. For example, we have already learned that the toad\r\nbelongs to the great group of back-boned animals, the Vertebrates, as\r\nthe group is called. So do the fishes and the birds, the reptiles and\r\nthe mammals or quadrupeds. But each of these constitutes a lesser\r\ngroup, and each may in turn be subdivided into still lesser groups.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the study of animals and plants their\r\nclassification or division into groups was based on the resemblances\r\nand the differences which the early naturalists found among the\r\norganisms they knew. At first all of the classifying was done by\r\npaying attention to external resemblances and differences, but later\r\nwhen naturalists began to dissect animals and to get acquainted with\r\nthe structure of the whole body, the differences and likenesses of\r\ninner parts, such as the skeleton and the organs of circulation and\r\nrespiration, were taken into account. At the present time and ever\r\nsince the theory of descent began to be accepted by naturalists (and\r\nthere is practically no one who does not now accept it), the\r\nclassification of animals, while still largely based on resemblances\r\nand differences among them, tells more than the simple fact that\r\nanimals of the same group resemble each other in certain structural\r\ncharacters. It means that the members of a group are related to each\r\nother by descent, that is, genealogically. They are all the\r\ndescendants of a common ancestor; they are all sprung from a common\r\nstock. And this added meaning of classification explains the older\r\nmeaning; it explains why the animals are alike. The members of a group\r\nresemble each other in structure because they are actually blood\r\nrelations. But as their common ancestor lived ages ago, we can learn\r\nthe history of this descent, and find out these blood relationships\r\namong animals only by the study of forms existing now, or through the\r\nfragmentary remains of extinct animals preserved in the rocks as\r\nfossils. As a matter of fact we usually learn of the existence of this\r\nactual blood relationship, or the fact of common ancestry among\r\nanimals, by studying their structure and finding out the resemblances\r\nand differences among them. If much alike we believe them closely\r\nrelated; if less alike we believe them less closely related, and so\r\non. So after all, though the present-day classification means\r\nsomething more, means a great deal more, in fact, than the\r\nclassification of the earlier naturalists means, it is largely based\r\non and determined by resemblances and differences just as was the old\r\nclassification. Sometimes the fossil remains of ancient animals tell\r\nus much about the ancestry and descent of existing forms. For example,\r\nthe present-day one-toed horse has been clearly shown by series of\r\nfossils to be descended from a small five-toed horse-like animal which\r\nlived in the Tertiary age.\r\n\r\n=Importance of development in determining classification.=--A very\r\nimportant means of determining the relationships among animals is by\r\nstudying their development. If two kinds of animals undergo very\r\nsimilar development, that is, if in their development and growth from\r\negg-cell to adult they pass through similar stages, they are nearly\r\nrelated. And by the correspondence or lack of correspondence, by the\r\nsimilarity or dissimilarity of the course of development of different\r\nanimals much regarding their relationship to each other is revealed.\r\nSometimes two kinds of animals which are really nearly related come to\r\ndiffer very much in appearance in their fully developed adult\r\ncondition because of the widely different life-habits the two may\r\nhave. But if they are nearly related their developmental stages will\r\nbe closely similar until the animals are almost fully developed. For\r\nexample, certain animals belonging to the group which includes the\r\ncrabs, lobsters, and crayfishes, have adopted a parasitic habit of\r\nlife, and in their adult condition live attached to the bodies of\r\ncertain kinds of true crabs. As these parasites have no need of moving\r\nabout, being carried by their hosts, they have lost their legs by\r\ndegeneration, and the body has come to be a mere sac-like pulsating\r\nmass, attached to the host by slender root-like processes, and not\r\nresembling at all the bodies of their relatives the crabs and\r\ncrayfishes. If we had to trust, in making out our classification,\r\nsolely to structural resemblances and differences, we should never\r\nclassify the _Sacculina_ (the parasite) in the group Crustacea, which\r\nis the group including the crabs and lobsters and crayfishes. But the\r\nyoung _Sacculina_ is an active free-swimming creature resembling the\r\nyoung crabs and young shrimps. By a study of the development of\r\n_Sacculina_ we find that it is more closely related to the crabs and\r\ncrayfishes and the other Crustaceans than to any other animals,\r\nalthough in adult condition it does not at all, at least in external\r\nappearance, resemble a crab or lobster.\r\n\r\n=Scientific names.=--To classify animals then, is to determine their\r\ntrue relationships and to express these relationships by a scheme of\r\ngroups. To these groups proper names are given for convenience in\r\nreferring to them. These proper names are all Latin or Greek, simply\r\nbecause these classic languages are taught in the schools and colleges\r\nof almost all the countries in the world, and are thus intelligible to\r\nnaturalists of all nationalities. In the older days, indeed, all the\r\nscientific books, the descriptions and accounts of animals and plants,\r\nwere written in Latin, and now most of the technical words used in\r\nnaming the parts of animals and plants are Latin. So that Latin may be\r\ncalled the language of science. For most of the groups of animals we\r\nhave English names as well as Greek or Latin ones and when talking\r\nwith an English-speaking person we can use these names. But when\r\nscientific men write of animals they use the names which have been\r\nagreed on by naturalists of all nationalities and which are understood\r\nby all of these naturalists. These Latin and Greek names of animals\r\nlaughed at by non-scientific persons as \"jaw-breakers,\" are really a\r\ngreat convenience, and save much circumlocution and misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     AN EXAMPLE OF CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--There should be provided a small set of bird-skins\r\n    which will serve just as well as freshly killed birds, and which may\r\n    be used for successive classes, thus doing away with the necessity\r\n    of shooting birds. The birds suggested for use are among the\r\n    commonest and most easily recognizable and obtainable. They may be\r\n    found in any locality at any time of the year. The skins can be\r\n    made by some boy interested in birds and acquainted with making\r\n    skins, or by the teacher, or can be purchased from a naturalists'\r\n    supply store, or dealer in bird skins. The skins will cost about 25\r\n    cents each. This example or lesson in classification can be given\r\n    just as well of course with other species of birds, or with a set of\r\n    some other kinds of animals, if the teacher prefers. Insects are\r\n    especially available, butterflies perhaps offering the most readily\r\n    appreciated resemblances and differences.\r\n\r\n=Species.=--Examine specimens of two male downy woodpeckers (the males\r\nhave a scarlet band on the back of the head). (In the western States\r\nuse Gardiner's downy woodpecker.) Note that the two birds are of the\r\nsame size, have the same colors and markings, and are in all respects\r\nalike. They are of the same kind; simply two individuals of the same\r\nkind of animal. There are hosts of other individuals of this kind of\r\nbird, all alike. This one kind of animal is called a _species_. The\r\nspecies is the smallest[4] group recognized among animals. No attempt\r\nis made to distinguish among the different individuals of one kind or\r\nspecies of animal as we do in our own case.\r\n\r\nExamine a specimen of the female downy woodpecker. It is like the male\r\nexcept that it does not have the scarlet neck-band. But despite this\r\ndifference we know that it belongs to the same species as the male\r\ndowny because they mate together and produce young woodpeckers, male\r\nand female, like themselves. There are thus two sorts of\r\nindividuals,[5] male and female, comprised in each species of animal.\r\nA _species_ is a group of animals comprising similar individuals which\r\nproduce new individuals of the same kind usually after the mating\r\ntogether of individuals of two sexes which may differ somewhat in\r\nappearance and structure.\r\n\r\nExamine a male hairy woodpecker and a female; (in western States\r\nsubstitute a Harris's hairy woodpecker). Note the similarity in markings\r\nand structure to the downy. Note the marked difference in size. Make\r\nnotes of measurements, colors and markings, and drawings of bill and\r\nfeet, showing the resemblances and the differences between the downy\r\nwoodpecker and the hairy woodpecker. These two kinds of woodpeckers are\r\nvery much alike, but the hairy woodpeckers are always much larger\r\n(nearly a half) than the downy woodpeckers and the two kinds never mate\r\ntogether. The hairy woodpeckers constitute another species of bird.\r\n\r\n=Genus.=--Examine now a flicker (the yellow-shafted or golden-winged\r\nflicker in the East, the red-shafted flicker in the West). Compare it\r\nwith the downy woodpecker and the hairy woodpecker. Make notes\r\nreferring to the differences, also the resemblances. The flicker is\r\nvery differently marked and colored and is also much larger than the\r\ndowny woodpecker, but its bill and feet and general make-up are\r\nsimilar and it is obviously a \"woodpecker.\" It is, however, evidently\r\nanother species of woodpecker, and a species which differs from either\r\nthe downy or the hairy woodpecker much more than these two species\r\ndiffer from each other. There are two other species of flickers in\r\nNorth America which, although different from the yellow-shafted\r\nflicker, yet resemble it much more than they do the downy and hairy\r\nwoodpeckers or any other woodpeckers. We can obviously make two groups\r\nof our woodpeckers so far studied, putting the downy and hairy\r\nwoodpeckers (together with half a dozen other species very much like\r\nthem) into one group and the three flickers together into another\r\ngroup. Each of these groups is called a _genus_, and genus is thus the\r\nname of the next group above the species. A genus usually includes\r\nseveral, or if there be such, many, similar species. Sometimes it\r\nincludes but a single known species. That is, a species may not have\r\nany other species resembling it sufficiently to group with it, and so\r\nit constitutes a genus by itself. If later naturalists should find\r\nother species resembling it they would put these new species into the\r\ngenus with the solitary species. Each genus of animals is given a\r\nGreek or Latin name, of a single word. Thus the genus including the\r\nhairy and downy woodpeckers is called _Dryobates_; and the genus\r\nincluding the flickers is called _Colaptes_. But it is necessary to\r\ndistinguish the various species which compose the genus _Colaptes_,\r\nand so each species is given a name which is composed of two words,\r\nfirst the word which is the name of the genus to which it belongs,\r\nand, second, a word which may be called the species word. The species\r\nword of the Yellow-shafted Flicker is _auratus_ (the Latin word for\r\ngolden), so that its scientific name is _Colaptes auratus_. The\r\nnatural question, Why not have a single word for the name of each\r\nspecies? may be answered thus: There are already known more than\r\n500,000 distinct species of living animals; it is certain that there\r\nare no less than several millions of species of living animals; new\r\nspecies are being found, described and named constantly; with all the\r\npossible ingenuity of the word-makers it would be an extremely\r\ndifficult task to find or to build up enough words to give each of\r\nthese species a separate name. This is not attempted. The same species\r\nword is often used for several different species of animals, but never\r\nfor more than one species belonging to a given genus. And the names of\r\nthe genera are never duplicated. (There are, of course, much fewer\r\ngenera than species, and the difficulty of finding words for them is\r\nnot so serious.) Thus the genus word in the two-word name of a species\r\nindicates at once to just what particular genus in the whole animal\r\nkingdom the species belongs, while the second or species word\r\ndistinguishes it from the few or many other species which are included\r\nin the same genus. This manner of naming species of animals and plants\r\n(for plants are given their scientific names according to the same\r\nplan) was devised by the great Swedish naturalist Linnæus in the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century and has been in use ever since.\r\n\r\n=Family.=--Examine a red-headed woodpecker (_Melanerpes\r\nerythrocephalus_) and a sapsucker (_Sphyrapicus varius_) and any other\r\nkinds of woodpeckers which can be got. Find out in what ways the hairy\r\nand downy woodpeckers (genus _Dryobates_), the flickers (genus\r\n_Colaptes_) and the other woodpeckers resemble each other. Examine\r\nespecially the bill, feet, wings and tail. These birds differ in size,\r\ncolor and markings, but they are obviously all alike in certain\r\nimportant structural respects. We recognize them all as woodpeckers.\r\nWe can group all the woodpeckers together, including several different\r\ngenera, to form a group which is called a _family_. A family is a\r\ngroup of genera which have a considerable number of common structural\r\nfeatures. Each family is given a proper name consisting of a single\r\nword. The family of woodpeckers is named _Picidæ_.\r\n\r\nWe have already learned that resemblances between animals indicate\r\n(usually) relationship, and that classifying animals is simply\r\nexpressing or indicating these relationships. When we group several\r\nspecies together to form a genus we indicate that these species are\r\nclosely related. And similarly a family is a group of related genera.\r\n\r\n=Order.=--There are other groups[6] higher or more comprehensive than\r\nfamilies, but the principle on which they are constituted is exactly\r\nthe same as that already explained. Thus a number of related families\r\nare grouped together to form an _order_. All the fowl-like birds,\r\nincluding the families of pheasants, turkeys, grouse and quail, all\r\nobviously related, constitute the order of gallinaceous birds called\r\n_Gallinæ_. The families of vultures, hawks and owls constitute the\r\norder of birds of prey, the _Raptores_, and the families of the\r\nthrushes, wrens, warblers, sparrows, black-birds, and many others\r\nconstitute the great order of perching birds (including all the\r\nsinging birds) called the _Passeres_.\r\n\r\n=Class and branch.=--But it is evident that all of these orders,\r\ntogether with the other bird orders, ought to be combined into a great\r\ngroup, which shall include all the birds, as distinguished from all\r\nother animals, as the fishes, insects, etc. Such a group of related\r\norders is called a _class_. The class of birds is named _Aves_. There\r\nis a class of fishes, _Pisces_, and one of frogs and salamanders,\r\n_Batrachia_, one of snakes and lizards called _Reptilia_, and one of\r\nthe quadrupeds which give milk to their young called _Mammalia_. Each\r\nof these classes is composed of several orders, each of which includes\r\nseveral families and so on down. But these five classes of Pisces,\r\nBatrachia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammals agree in being composed of\r\nanimals which have a backbone or a backbone-like structure, while\r\nthere are many other animals which do not have a backbone, such as the\r\ninsects, the starfishes, etc. Hence these five backboned classes may\r\nbe brought together into a higher group called a _branch_ or _phylum_.\r\nThey compose the branch of backboned animals, the branch _Vertebrata_;\r\nall the animals like the starfishes, sea-urchins and sea-lilies which\r\nhave the parts of their body arranged in a radiate manner compose the\r\nbranch _Echinodermata_; all the animals like the insects and spiders\r\nand centipedes and crabs and crayfishes which have the body composed\r\nof a series of segments or rings and have legs or appendages each\r\ncomposed of a series of joints or segments make up the branch\r\n_Arthropoda_. And so might be enumerated all the great branches or\r\nprincipal groups into which the animal kingdom is divided.\r\n\r\nIn the remainder of this book the classification of animals is always\r\nkept in sight, and the student will see the terms species, genus,\r\nfamily, order, etc., practically used. In it all should be kept\r\nconstantly in mind the significance of classification, that is, the\r\nexistence of actual relationships among animals through descent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] The lesser group called _variety_, or subspecies, we may leave out\r\nof consideration for the present.\r\n\r\n[5] Some species of animals are not represented by male individuals:\r\nand in some all the individuals are hermaphrodites, as explained in\r\nchapter XIV.\r\n\r\n[6] Each of these higher groups has a proper name composed of a single\r\nword. In the case of no group except the species is a name-word ever\r\nduplicated. Each genus, family, order, or higher group has a name-word\r\npeculiar to it, and belonging to it alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                    BRANCH PROTOZOA: THE ONE-CELLED\r\n                                ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this group the structure and life-history of the Amœba (_Amœba_\r\nsp.) and the Slipper Animalcule (_Paramœcium_ sp.) have already been\r\ntreated in Chapter VI. Another example is the\r\n\r\n\r\n                   BELL ANIMALCULE (_Vorticella_ sp.)\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Specimens of _Vorticella_ may usually be found in\r\n    the same water with _Amœba_ and _Paramœcium_. The individuals live\r\n    together in colonies, a single colony appearing to the naked eye\r\n    as a tiny whitish mould-like tuft or spot on the surface of some\r\n    leaf or stem or root in the water. Touch such a spot with a\r\n    needle, and if it is a Vorticellid colony it will contract\r\n    instantly. Bring bits of leaves, stems, etc., bearing Vorticellid\r\n    colonies into the laboratory and keep in a small stagnant-water\r\n    aquarium (a battery-jar of pond-water will do).\r\n\r\nExamine a colony of _Vorticella_ in a watch-glass of water or in a\r\ndrop of water on a glass slide under the microscope. Note the stemmed\r\nbell-shaped bodies which compose the colony. Each bell and stem\r\ntogether form an individual _Vorticella_ (fig. 8.) How are the members\r\nof the colony fastened together? Tap the slide and note the sudden\r\ncontraction of the animals; also the details of contraction in the\r\ncase of an individual. Watch the colony expand; note the details of\r\nthis movement in the case of an individual.\r\n\r\nMake drawings showing the colony expanded and contracted.\r\n\r\nWith higher power examine a single individual. Note the thickened,\r\nbent-out, upper margin of the bell. This margin is called the\r\n_peristome_. With what is it fringed? The free end of the bell is\r\nnearly filled by a central disk, the _epistome_, with arched upper\r\nsurface and a circlet of _cilia_. Between the epistome and peristome\r\nis a groove, the _mouth_ or _vestibule_, which leads into the body.\r\nStudy the internal structure of the transparent, bell-shaped body.\r\nNote the differentiation of the protoplasm comprising the body into an\r\ninner transparent colorless _endosarc_ containing various dark-colored\r\ngranules, vacuoles, oil-drops, etc., and an outer uniformly granular\r\n_ectosarc_ not containing vacuoles. Is the stalk formed of ectosarc or\r\nendosarc or of both? Note the curved _nucleus_ lying in the endosarc.\r\n(This may be difficult to distinguish in some specimens.) Note the\r\nnumerous large circular granules, the _food vacuoles_. Note the\r\n_contractile vesicle_, larger and clearer than the food vacuoles. Note\r\nthe thin _cuticle_ lining the whole body externally. A high\r\nmagnification will show fine transverse ridges or rows of dots on the\r\ncuticle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--_Vorticella_ sp.; one individual with stalk\r\ncoiled, and one with stalk extended. (From life.)]\r\n\r\nMake a drawing showing the internal structure.\r\n\r\nObserve a living specimen carefully for some time to determine all of\r\nits movements. Note the contraction and extension of the stalk, the\r\nmovements of the cilia of peristome and epistome, the flowing or\r\nstreaming of the fluid endosarc (indicated by the movements of the\r\nfood vacuoles), the behavior of the contractile vesicle.\r\n\r\nMake notes and drawings explaining these motions.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of _Vorticella_ may perhaps be found dividing, or two\r\nbell-shaped bodies may be found on a single stem, one of the bodies\r\nbeing sometimes smaller than the other. These two bodies have been\r\nproduced by the longitudinal division or fission of a single body. In\r\nthis process a cleft first appears at the distal end of the\r\nbell-shaped body, and gradually deepens until the original body is\r\ndivided quite in two. The stalk divides for a very short distance. One\r\nof the new bell-shaped bodies develops a circlet of cilia near the\r\nstalked end. After a while it breaks away and swims about by means of\r\nthis basal circlet of cilia. Later it settles down, becomes attached\r\nby its basal end, loses its basal cilia and develops a stalk.\r\n\r\n\"Conjugation occurs sometimes, but it is unlike the conjugation of\r\n_Paramœcium_ in two important points: Firstly, the conjugation is\r\nbetween two dissimilar forms; an ordinary large-stalked form, and a much\r\nsmaller free-swimming form which has originated by repeated division of\r\na large form. Secondly, the union of the two is a complete and permanent\r\nfusion, the smaller being absorbed into the larger. This permanent\r\nfusion of a small active cell with a relatively large fixed cell,\r\nfollowed by division of the fused mass, presents a striking analogy to\r\nthe process of sexual reproduction occurring in higher animals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER PROTOZOA\r\n\r\nBesides the _Amœba_, _Paramœcium_, and _Vorticella_ there are\r\nthousands of other Protozoa. Most of them live in water, but a few\r\nlive in damp sand or moss, and some live inside the bodies of other\r\nanimals as parasites. Of those which live in water some are marine,\r\nwhile others are found only in fresh-water streams and lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Sun animalcule, a fresh-water protozoan with a\r\nsiliceous skeleton, and long thread-like protoplasmic prolongations.\r\n(From life.)]\r\n\r\n=Form of body.=--The Protozoa all agree in having the body composed\r\nfor its whole lifetime of a single cell,[7] but they differ much in\r\nshape and appearance. Some of them are of the general shape and\r\ncharacter of _Amœba_, sending out and retracting blunt, finger-like\r\npseudopodia, the body-mass itself having no fixed form or outline but\r\nconstantly changing. Others have the body of definite form, spherical,\r\nelliptical, or flattened, enclosed by a thin cuticle, and having a\r\ndefinite number of fine thread-like or hair-like protoplasmic\r\nprolongations called flagella or cilia. Many of the familiar Protozoa\r\nof the fresh-water ponds always have two whiplash-like flagella\r\nprojecting from one end of the body. By means of the lashing of these\r\nflagella in the water the tiny creature swims about. Others have many\r\nhundreds of fine short cilia scattered, sometimes in regular rows,\r\nover the body-surface. The Protozoan swims by the vibration of these\r\ncilia in the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Stentor_ sp.; a protozoan which may be\r\nfixed, like _Vorticella_, or free-swimming, at will, and which has the\r\nnucleus in the shape of a string or chain of bead-like bodies. The\r\nfigure shows a single individual as it appeared when fixed, with\r\nelongate, stalked body, and as it appeared when swimming about with\r\ncontracted body. (From life.)]\r\n\r\nThere is no stagnant pool, no water standing exposed in watering-trough\r\nor barrel which does not contain thousands of individuals of the\r\none-celled animals. And in any such stagnant water there may always be\r\nfound several or many different kinds or species. A drop of this water\r\nexamined with the compound microscope will prove to be a tiny world (all\r\nan ocean) with most of its animals and plants one-celled in structure. A\r\nfew many-celled animals will be found in it preying on the one-celled\r\nones. There are sudden and violent deaths here, and births (by fission\r\nof the parent) and active locomotion and food-getting and growth and all\r\nof the businesses and functions of life which we are accustomed to see\r\nin the more familiar world of larger animals.\r\n\r\n=Marine Protozoa.=--One usually thinks of the ocean as the home of the\r\nwhales and the seals and the sea-lions, and of the countless fishes,\r\nthe cod, and the herring, and the mackerel. Those who have been on the\r\nseashore will recall the sea-urchins and starfishes and the\r\nsea-anemones which live in the tide-pools. On the beach there are the\r\ninnumerable shells, too, each representing an animal which has lived\r\nin the ocean. But more abundant than all of these, and in one way more\r\nimportant than all, are the myriads of the marine Protozoa.\r\n\r\nAlthough the water at the surface of the ocean appears clear and on\r\nsuperficial examination seems to contain no animals, yet in certain\r\nparts of the ocean (especially in the southern seas) a microscopical\r\nexamination of this water shows it to be swarming with Protozoa. And\r\nnot only is the water just at the surface inhabited by one-celled\r\nanimals, but they can be found in all the water from the surface to a\r\ngreat depth below it. In a pint of this ocean-water there may be\r\nmillions of these minute animals. In the oceans of the world the\r\nnumber of them is inconceivable. And it is necessary that these\r\nProtozoa exist in such great numbers, for they and the marine\r\none-celled plants (Protophyta) supply directly or indirectly the food\r\nfor all the other animals of the ocean.\r\n\r\nAmong all these ocean Protozoa none are more interesting than those\r\nbelonging to the two orders Foraminifera (fig. 11) and Radiolaria. The\r\nmany kinds belonging to these orders secrete a tiny shell (of lime in\r\nthe Foraminifera, of silica in the Radiolaria) which encloses most of\r\nthe one-celled body. These minute shells present a great variety of\r\nshape and pattern, many being of the most exquisite symmetry and\r\nbeauty. The shells are perforated by many small holes through which\r\nproject long, delicate, protoplasmic pseudopodia. These fine\r\npseudopodia often interlace and fuse when they touch each other, thus\r\nforming a sort of protoplasmic network outside of the shell. In some\r\ncases there is a complete layer of protoplasm--part of the body\r\nprotoplasm of the Protozoan--surrounding the cell externally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Rosalina varians_, a marine protozoan\r\n(Foraminifera) with calcareous shell. (After Schultze.)]\r\n\r\nWhen these tiny animals die their hard shells sink to the bottom of\r\nthe ocean, and accumulate slowly, in inconceivable numbers, until they\r\nform a thick bed on the ocean floor. Large areas of the bottom of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean are covered with this slimy ooze, called Foraminifera\r\nooze or Radiolaria ooze, depending on the kinds of animals which have\r\nformed it. Nor is it only in present times that there has been a\r\nforming of such beds by the marine Protozoa. All over the world there\r\nare thick rock strata composed almost exclusively of the fossil shells\r\nof these simplest animals. The chalk-beds and cliffs of England, and\r\nof France, Greece, Spain, and America, were made by Foraminifera.\r\nWhere now is land were once oceans the bottoms of which have been\r\ngradually lifted above the water's surface. Similarly the rock called\r\nTripoli found in Sicily and the Barbadoes earth from the island of\r\nBarbadoes are composed of the shells of ancient Radiolaria.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that the Protozoa is an ancient group of animals.\r\nAs a matter of fact zoologists are certain that it is the most ancient\r\nof all animal groups. All of the animals of the ocean depend upon the\r\nmarine Protozoa and the marine Protophyta, one-celled plants, for\r\nfood. Either they feed on them directly, or prey on animals which in\r\nturn prey on these simplest organisms. A well-known zoologist has\r\nsaid: \"The food-supply of marine animals consists of a few species of\r\nmicroscopic organisms which are inexhaustible and the only source of\r\nfood for all the inhabitants of the ocean. The supply is primeval as\r\nwell as inexhaustible, and all the life of the ocean has gradually\r\ntaken shape in direct dependence on it.\" The marine Protozoa are the\r\nonly animals which live independently; they alone can live or could\r\nhave lived in earlier ages without depending on other animals. They\r\nmust therefore be the oldest of marine animals. By oldest is meant\r\nthat their kind appeared earliest in the history of the world, and as\r\nit is certain that ocean life is older than terrestrial life--that is,\r\nthat the first animals lived in the ocean--it is obvious that the\r\nmarine Protozoa are the most ancient of all animal groups.\r\n\r\nAs already learned in the examination of examples of one-celled\r\nanimals, it is evident that life may be successfully maintained\r\nwithout a complex body composed of many organs performing their\r\nfunctions in a specialized way. The marine Protozoa illustrate this\r\nfact admirably. Despite their lack of special organs and their\r\nprimitive way of performing the life-processes, that they live\r\nsuccessfully is shown by their existence in such extraordinary\r\nnumbers. They outnumber all other animals. The conditions of life in\r\nthe surface-waters of the ocean are easy and constant, and a simple\r\nstructure and simple method of performing the necessary life-processes\r\nare wholly adequate for successful life under these conditions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] In some Protozoa a number of similar cells temporarily unite to form\r\na colony, but each cell may still be regarded as an individual animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                      BRANCH PORIFERA: THE SPONGES\r\n\r\n                THE FRESH-WATER SPONGE (_Spongilla_ sp.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Fresh-water sponges may perhaps not be readily\r\n    found in the neighborhood of the school, but they occur over most\r\n    of the United States, and careful searching will usually result in\r\n    the finding of specimens. They are compact, solid-looking masses,\r\n    sometimes lobed, resting on and attached to rocks, logs, timbers,\r\n    etc., in clear water in creeks, ponds, or bayous. They are creamy,\r\n    yellowish-brown or even greenish in color and resemble some\r\n    cushion-like plant far more than any of the familiar animal forms.\r\n    They can be distinguished from plants, however, by the fact that\r\n    there are no leaves in the mass, nor long thread-like fibres such\r\n    as compose the masses of pond algæ (pond scum). When touched with\r\n    the fingers a gritty feeling is noticeable, due to the presence of\r\n    many small stiff spicules. Sponges should be removed entire from\r\n    the substance they are attached to, and may be taken alive to the\r\n    laboratory. They die soon, however, and should be put into alcohol\r\n    before decay begins.\r\n\r\nNote the form of the sponge mass. Is it lobed or branched? Examine the\r\nsurface for openings. These are of two sizes; the larger are _osteoles_\r\nor _exhalant openings_, while the smaller and more numerous are _pores_\r\nor _inhalant openings_. The sponge-flesh is called _sarcode_. Examine a\r\nbit of sarcode under the microscope; note the _spicules_. Have these\r\nspicules a regular arrangement? Of what are they composed?\r\n\r\nDraw the entire sponge, showing shape and openings; draw some of the\r\nspicules.\r\n\r\nEmbedded in the body-substance, especially near the base, note (if\r\npresent) numerous small, yellowish, sub-spherical or disk-like\r\nbodies, the _gemmules_. These are reproductive bodies. Each gemmule is\r\na sort of internal bud. It is composed of an interior group of\r\nprotoplasmic cells, enclosed by a crust thickly covered with spicules.\r\nIn winter the sponge dies down and the gemmules are set free in the\r\nwater. In spring the protoplasmic contents issue through an aperture\r\nin the crust, called the _micropyle_ or _foraminal opening_, and\r\ndevelop and grow into a new sponge.\r\n\r\nFor a good account of the fresh-water sponge, see Pott's \"Fresh-water\r\nSponges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n      A CALCAREOUS OCEAN-SPONGE (_Grantia_ sp.) (fig. 7, D, E, F.)\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--For inland schools, specimens preserved in\r\n    alcohol or formalin must be used. They may be obtained from\r\n    dealers in naturalists' supplies (see p. 453). Specimens of some\r\n    species of this genus can be obtained at almost any point on the\r\n    Atlantic or Pacific coasts of this country.\r\n\r\nExamine the external structure of a specimen. Note the elongate,\r\nsub-cylindrical form, the attached base, the free end. Note the large\r\nexhalant opening, _osteole_ or _osculum_, at the free end; the\r\nnumerous small inhalant openings elsewhere on the surface (best seen\r\nin dried specimens). Note the _spicules_ covering the surface of the\r\nbody, and the longer ones surrounding the osculum. Cut the sponge in\r\ntwo longitudinally and note the simple cylindrical body-cavity, the\r\n_gastric cavity_ or _cloaca_. Note the thickness of the body-wall;\r\nnote the tubes running through the body-wall from cloaca to external\r\nsurface. Through these tubes water laden with food enters the gastric\r\ncavity, where the food is digested, the water and undigested particles\r\npassing out through the osculum. Crush a bit of dried sponge, or boil\r\na bit of soft sponge in caustic potash and mount on a glass slide.\r\nExamine under a microscope and note the abundance of spicules and the\r\nvariety in their form. Two kinds may always be found, and sometimes\r\nthree. These spicules are composed of carbonate of lime and can be\r\ndissolved by pouring on to them a drop of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nSome of the sponges may have buds growing out from them near the base.\r\nThese buds are young sponges developed asexually. If allowed to\r\ndevelop fully the buds would have detached themselves from the parent\r\nand each would have become a new sponge.\r\n\r\nMake drawings showing the form of a whole sponge; the appearance of\r\nthe inner face of the sponge bisected longitudinally; the shape of the\r\nspicules.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A COMMERCIAL SPONGE\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--For the study of the skeleton of an ocean-sponge\r\n    with more complex body buy several common small bath-sponges without\r\n    large holes running entirely through them. The teacher should have\r\n    also a few specimens of small marine sponges preserved in alcohol or\r\n    formalin. Such specimens should be part of the laboratory equipment\r\n    (see account of laboratory equipment, p. 450), and can be readily\r\n    and cheaply obtained from dealers in naturalists' supplies.\r\n\r\nThe bath-sponge or slate-sponge consists simply of the hard parts or\r\nskeleton of a sponge animal. In life all of the skeleton is enclosed\r\nor covered by a soft, tough mass composed of layers of cells. Note the\r\nmany openings on the surface of the sponge. Crush a bit of the\r\nskeleton and examine it under the microscope. Note that it is composed\r\nof fine fibres of a tough, horny substance called _spongin_, instead\r\nof tiny distinct calcareous spicules.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER SPONGES\r\n\r\nThe sponges are fixed, plant-like aquatic animals. The members of a\r\nsingle family live in fresh water, being found in lakes, rivers, and\r\ncanals in all parts of the world. All the other sponges, and there are\r\nseveral thousand species known, live in the ocean. They are to be\r\nfound at all depths, some in shallow water near the shore and others\r\nin deeper water, even to the deepest depths yet explored. They are\r\nfound in all seas, though especially abundantly in the Atlantic Ocean\r\nand Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\n=Form and size.=--The shape of the simplest sponges is that of a tiny\r\nvase or nearly cylindrical cup, hollow and attached at its base. At the\r\nfree end there is a large opening. But there is a great deal of variety\r\nin the form and size of different sponges. There is, indeed, much\r\nvariation in the shape and general character of different individuals of\r\nthe same species. Unlike most other animals, sponges are fixed, and the\r\ncharacter of the surface to which a sponge is attached has much\r\ninfluence upon its shape. If this surface is rough and uneven the sponge\r\nmay follow in its growth the sinuosities of the surface and so become\r\nuneven and distorted in shape. At best, only a few kinds of sponges have\r\nany very even and symmetrical shape. Most of them are very unsymmetrical\r\nand grow more like a low compact bushy plant than like the animals we\r\nare familiar with. The smallest sponges are only 1 mm. (1/25 in.) high,\r\nwhile the largest may be over a meter (39 in.) in height. In color\r\nliving sponges may be red, purple, orange, gray, and sometimes blue.\r\nMost sponges have the whole body of one color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--The skeleton of a \"glass\" sponge (skeleton\r\ncomposed of siliceous spicules) from Japan. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\n=Skeleton.=--A very few sponges have no skeleton at all. The others\r\nhave a skeleton or hard parts composed of interwoven fibres of the\r\ntough, horny substance called spongin, or of hosts of fine needles or\r\nspicules of silica or of carbonate of lime. The siliceous skeletons of\r\nsome of the so-called glass-sponges (fig. 12) are very beautiful. The\r\nlime and siliceous sponge spicules exhibit a great variety of outline,\r\nsome being anchor-shaped, some cross-shaped, and some resembling tiny\r\nspears or javelins.\r\n\r\n=Structure of body.=--The skeleton of a sponge whether composed of\r\ninterlacing fibres or of short spicules is always invisible from the\r\noutside when the sponge is alive. It is embedded in, or clothed by,\r\nthe soft, fleshy part of the body. The soft part of the sponge is\r\ncomposed simply of two layers of cells, one constituting the external\r\nsurface of the body, and the other lining the interior cavities and\r\ncanals of the body. Between these two cell-layers there is a mass of\r\nsoft gelatinous substance all through which protoplasm ramifies, and\r\nin which are embedded numerous scattered cells. There are, as seen in\r\nthe case of _Spongilla_ and _Grantia_, no systems of organs such as\r\ncharacterize the higher animals. No heart, lungs, alimentary canal,\r\nnervous system, organs of locomotion, eyes, ears, or other organs of\r\nspecial sense; the sponge has none of these. It is simply an aggregate\r\nof cells, arranged in two layers, and supported usually by a skeleton\r\nof horny fibres or calcareous or siliceous spicules. Its body is\r\nusually shapeless, unsymmetrical and without front or back, right or\r\nleft. It is not to be wondered at that sponges were for a long time\r\nbelieved to be plants.\r\n\r\n=Feeding habits.=--The sponges feed on minute bits of animal or plant\r\nsubstance and on the microscopic unicellular plants or animals which\r\nfloat in the water which bathes their bodies. The water entering the\r\nsponge-body through the various openings of the surface is moved\r\nalong by the waving or lashing of the flagella of the cells which line\r\nthe canals, and these currents of water bear with them the tiny\r\norganisms which are taken up by these same cells and digested. The\r\nincoming currents of water meet in the central cavity or cavities of\r\nthe body and pass out through the large opening called the osculum at\r\nthe free end of the vase-like body, or if the body is branched,\r\nthrough the large openings at the tips of these branches.\r\n\r\nThe same currents of water bring also oxygen for the sponge's breathing\r\nand carry away the carbonic acid gas given out by the body-cells.\r\n\r\nAs a German naturalist has said, the one necessary condition for the\r\nlife of a sponge is the streaming of water through its body. All\r\nsponges have a system of canals for this water-current and all have\r\nmeans, in the waving flagella or cilia with which these canals are\r\nlined, for producing these currents. When a live sponge is put into a\r\nvessel of water, currents are immediately set up, and they always flow\r\ninto the body through the many fine openings and out of the body\r\nthrough the osculum.\r\n\r\n=Development and life-history.=--Although the sponge in its adult\r\ncondition is permanently attached by its base to the sea-bottom or to\r\nsome rock or shell, when it is first born it is an active free-swimming\r\ncreature. The sponges reproduce in two ways, asexually and sexually. The\r\nasexual mode of reproduction of the fresh-water sponge by gemmules has\r\nalready been described. The ocean sponges also reproduce asexually\r\neither by forming interior gemmules or external buds. In this latter\r\nmethod a bud forms on the outer surface of the body which increases in\r\nsize and finally grows into a new sponge individual. In some species\r\nthis new sponge does not become separated from the body of the mother,\r\nbut remains attached to it like a branch to a tree-trunk. By the\r\ncontinued production of such non-separating individuals, a colony of\r\nsponges is formed which has the general appearance of a branching plant.\r\nIn other species the new sponge formed by the development and growth of\r\na bud falls off and becomes a distinct separate individual.\r\n\r\nIn the sexual mode of reproduction, male or sperm-cells and female or\r\negg-cells are developed in the same individual. The sperm-cells are\r\nmotile and swim about in the cavities and canals of the sponge-body\r\nuntil they find egg-cells, which they fertilize. The fertilized eggs\r\nbegin to develop and pass through their first stages in the\r\nsponge-body. Finally the embryo sponge, which is usually a tiny oval\r\nor egg-shaped mass of cells, escapes from the body of the parent into\r\nthe water. The young sponge has some of its outer cells provided with\r\ncilia, and by means of these it swims about. After a while it comes to\r\nrest on the ocean-floor or on some rock or shell, attaches itself, and\r\nbegins to take on the form and character of the parent. It leads\r\nhereafter a fixed sedentary life.\r\n\r\n=The sponges of commerce.=--The sponge-skeletons which are the\r\n\"sponges\" that we use all belong to a few species, not more than half\r\na dozen. Most of the commercial sponges come from the Mediterranean\r\nSea, though some come from the Bahama Islands, some from the Red Sea,\r\nand a few from the coasts of Greece, Asia Minor, and Africa. The\r\ncommercial sponges do not live in very deep water; they are usually\r\nfound not deeper than 200 feet. The living sponges are collected by\r\ndivers, or are dragged up by men in boats using long-poled hooks, or\r\ndredges. \"When secured they are exposed to the air for a limited time,\r\neither in the boats or on shore, and then thrown in heaps into the\r\nwater again in pens or tanks built for the purpose. Decay thus takes\r\nplace with great rapidity, and when fully decayed they are fished up\r\nagain, and the animal matter beaten, squeezed, or washed out, leaving\r\nthe cleaned skeleton ready for the market. In this condition after\r\nbeing dried and sorted, they are sold to the dealers, who have them\r\ntrimmed, re-sorted and put up in bales or on strings ready for\r\nexportation. There are many modifications of these processes in\r\ndifferent places, but in a general way these are the essential-steps\r\nthrough which the sponge passes before it is considered suitable for\r\ndomestic purposes. Bleaching-powders or acids are sometimes used to\r\nlighten the color, but these unless very delicately handled injure the\r\ndurability of the fibres.\"\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The sponges are classified according to the character\r\nof the skeleton. In one group are put all those sponges which have a\r\nskeleton of calcareous spicules, and this group is called the Calcarea.\r\nAll other sponges are grouped as Non-Calcarea, the members of this group\r\neither having no skeleton at all, or having a skeleton composed of\r\nsiliceous spicules or of spongin fibres. According to the absence or\r\npresence of a skeleton and the character of the skeleton when it exists\r\nthe Non-Calcarea are subdivided into smaller groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n            BRANCH CŒLENTERATA: THE POLYPS, SEA-ANEMONES,\r\n                        CORALS, AND JELLYFISHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe structure and life-history of an example of the polyps (the\r\nFresh-water Hydra, _Hydra_ sp.) has been studied in Chapters X and XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                OTHER POLYPS, SEA-ANEMONES, CORALS, AND\r\n                              JELLYFISHES\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The teacher should have, if possible, several\r\n    pieces of coral and a few specimens of Cœlenterates in alcohol or\r\n    formalin, which will show the external character, at least, of\r\n    these animals (see account of laboratory equipment, p. 450). If\r\n    the school is on the coast, the pupils should be shown the\r\n    sea-anemones of the tide-pools.\r\n\r\nThe animals which are included in the branch Cœlenterata are, at least\r\nin living condition, unfamiliar to most of us. Like the sponges, they\r\nare almost all inhabitants of the ocean; a few, like _Hydra_, live in\r\nfresh water. Like the sponges, too, most of the members of this branch\r\nare fixed, and in their general appearance suggest a plant rather than\r\nan animal. The name zoophytes, or plant-animals, which is often\r\napplied to these animals is based on this superficial resemblance. But\r\nmany of the Cœlenterates lead an active free-swimming life. This is\r\ntrue of the jellyfishes which float or swim about on or near the\r\nsurface of the ocean. Many of the zoophytes spend part of their life\r\nin an active free-swimming condition before settling down, becoming\r\nattached and thereafter remaining fixed. In localities near the\r\nseashore many animals belonging to this great group can be readily\r\nfound and observed. The beautiful sea-anemones with their\r\nslowly-waving tentacles, the fine many-branched truly plant-like\r\nhydroids with their hosts of little buds, and the soft colorless\r\nmasses of jelly, the jellyfishes, which are cast up on to the beaches\r\nby the waves are all animals belonging to the branch Cœlenterata.\r\n\r\n=General form and organization of body.=--The general or typical plan of\r\nbody-structure for the Cœlenterata, these animals which come next to the\r\nsponges in degree of complexity, can best be understood by imagining the\r\ntypical cylindrical or vase-like body of the simple sponges to be\r\nmodified in the following way: The middle one of the three layers of the\r\nbody-wall not to be composed of scattered cells in a gelatinous matrix,\r\nbut to be simply a thin non-cellular membrane; the body-wall not to be\r\npierced by fine openings or pores, but connected with the outside only\r\nby the single large opening at the free end, and this opening to be\r\nsurrounded by a circlet of arm-like processes or tentacles, which are\r\ncontinuations of the body-wall and similarly composed. Such a\r\nbody-structure, which we saw well shown by _Hydra_, is the fundamental\r\none for all polyps, sea-anemones, corals, and jellyfishes. The variety\r\nin shape of the body and the superficial modifications of this type-plan\r\nare many and striking, but after all the type-plan is recognizable\r\nthroughout the whole of this great group of animals.\r\n\r\nThe two chief body-shapes represented in the branch are those of the\r\npolyps on the one hand, and the jellyfishes or medusæ on the other. The\r\npolyp-shape is that of a tube with a basal end blind or closed, attached\r\nto some firm object in the water and with the free end with an opening,\r\nthe mouth-opening. At this mouth-end there is a circlet of movable, very\r\ncontractile tentacles. The mouth may open directly into the interior of\r\nthe body, which interior may be called the digestive cavity, or it may\r\nlead into a simple short tube produced by the invagination or bending in\r\nof the body-wall, which may be looked on as the simplest kind of\r\nœsophagus. This œsophageal tube opens into the body-cavity or digestive\r\ncavity. This cavity may be incompletely divided by longitudinal\r\npartitions which project from the sides into the cavity.\r\n\r\nThe jellyfish or medusoid body-form corresponds in general to an\r\numbrella or bell. Around the edge of this umbrella are disposed\r\nnumerous threads or tentacles (corresponding to the circlet of\r\ntentacles in the polyp). The mouth-opening is at the end of a longer\r\nor shorter projection which hangs down from the middle of the under\r\nside of the umbrella. The interior body-cavity or digestive cavity\r\nextends out into the umbrella-shaped part of the body, usually in the\r\ncondition of canals radiating from the centre and a connecting canal\r\nrunning around the margin of the umbrella.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=--Although the Cœlenterata show little indication of the\r\ncomplex composition of the body out of organs, as it exists among the\r\nhigher animals, yet they do show an unmistakable advance on the simple,\r\nalmost organless body of the sponges. This is chiefly shown by the\r\ndifferentiation among the cells which compose the body. In the polyps\r\nand jellyfishes some of the cells are specialized to be unmistakable\r\nmuscle-cells, some to be nerve-cells and fibres, and so on. A very\r\nsimple nervous system consisting of small groups of nerve-cells\r\nconnected by nerve-fibres exists. Some very simple special sense-organs\r\nmay occur. The digestive system, although in the simpler Cœlenterates\r\nconsisting merely of the cylindrical body-cavity enclosed by the\r\nbody-wall and opening by the single hole at the free end of the body, in\r\nsome is rather complex and is composed of different parts. Those\r\nCœlenterates which are not fixed but lead an active, free-swimming life,\r\nviz., the jellyfishes or medusæ, are the most highly organized.\r\n\r\nThe tentacles which surround the mouth-opening and serve to grasp food\r\nand carry it into the mouth, and the stinging or lasso threads with\r\nwhich these tentacles are provided are special organs possessed by\r\nmost of these animals.\r\n\r\n=Skeleton.=--Like the sponges, some of the Cœlenterata possess a hard\r\nskeleton. This skeleton is always composed of calcium carbonate and is\r\ncalled _coral_. Those polyps which form such a skeleton are called the\r\ncorals. Coral will be described in connection with the account of the\r\ncoral-polyps.\r\n\r\n=Development and life-history.=--The polyps and jellyfishes reproduce\r\nboth asexually and sexually. The asexual mode is usually that of\r\nbudding. On a polyp a bud is formed by a hollow outgrowth of the\r\nbody-wall. The bud grows, an opening appears at its distal end, a\r\ncirclet of tentacles arises about this mouth-opening and a new polyp\r\nindividual is formed. This individual may separate from the parent or\r\nit may remain attached to it. By the development of numerous buds, and\r\nthe remaining attached of all of the individuals developing from these\r\nbuds, a colony of polyp individuals may be formed, plant-like in\r\nappearance. The various polyp individuals of a colony may differ\r\nsomewhat among themselves, and these differences are correlated with a\r\ndivision of labor. Thus some of the individuals may devote themselves\r\nto getting food for the colony, and these have mouth and tentacles.\r\nOthers may be devoted to the production of new individuals by budding\r\nor by producing germ-cells, and may not have any mouth-opening or any\r\nfood-grasping tentacles.\r\n\r\nIn case of many polyps all or some of the new individuals which arise\r\nby budding do not become polyps, but develop into medusæ or jellyfish,\r\nwhich separate from the fixed polyp and swim off through the water.\r\nThese medusæ or jellyfish produce sperm-cells and egg-cells. The\r\nsperm-cells fertilize the egg-cells and a new individual develops from\r\neach fertilized egg. This new individual is at first an active\r\nfree-swimming larva called a _planula_, which does not resemble either\r\na medusa or polyp. After a while it settles down, becomes fixed and\r\ndevelops into a polyp. Thus a polyp may produce a medusa or jellyfish\r\nwhich, however, produces not a new jellyfish, but a polyp. This is\r\ncalled an _alternation of generations_, and is not an uncommon\r\nphenomenon among the lower animals. It results from such an\r\nalternation of generations that a single species of animal may have\r\ntwo distinct forms. This having two different forms is called\r\n_dimorphism_. Sometimes, indeed, a species may appear in more than two\r\ndifferent forms; such a condition is called _polymorphism_.\r\n\r\nNot all medusæ or jellyfish are produced by polyp individuals, nor do\r\njellyfish always produce polyps and not jellyfishes. There are some\r\njellyfishes (we might call them the true jellyfishes) which always\r\nhave the jellyfish form, producing new jellyfishes either by budding\r\nor by eggs, and there are some polyps which always have the true polyp\r\nform, producing new individuals, either by budding or by eggs, always\r\nof polyp form and never of jellyfish form. That is, some species of\r\nCœlenterata exist only in polyp form, some species exist only in\r\njellyfish form, while some species (those having an alternation of\r\ngenerations) exist in both polyp and jellyfish form, these two forms\r\nappearing as alternate generations.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The branch Cœlenterata is divided into four\r\nclasses: (1) the Hydrozoa, including the fresh-water polyps, numerous\r\nmarine polyps, many small jellyfishes and a few corals; (2) the\r\nScyphozoa, including most of the large jellyfishes; (3) the Actinozoa,\r\nincluding the sea-anemones and most of the stony corals; (4) the\r\nCtenophora, including certain peculiar jellyfishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--The Portuguese Man-of-War (_Physalia_ sp.).\r\n(From specimen from Atlantic Coast.)]\r\n\r\n=The polyps, colonial jellyfishes, etc. (Hydrozoa).=--To the class\r\nHydrozoa belongs the _Hydra_ already studied. There are a few other\r\nfresh-water polyps and they all belong to this class. The most\r\ninteresting members of the class are the \"colonial jellyfishes,\"\r\nconstituting the order Siphonophora. These colonial jellyfishes are\r\nfloating or swimming colonies of polypoid and medusoid individuals in\r\nwhich there is a marked division of labor among the individuals,\r\naccompanied by marked differences in structural character. The\r\nindividuals are accordingly polymorphic, that is, appear in various\r\nforms, although all belong to the same species. Because these various\r\nindividuals forming a colony have given up very largely their\r\nindividuality, combining together and acting together like the organs\r\nof a complex animal, they are usually not called individuals, nor on\r\nthe other hand organs, but _zooids_, or animal-like structures. The\r\nbeautiful \"Portuguese man-of-war\" (fig. 13) is one of these colonial\r\njellyfishes. It appears as a delicate bladder-like float, brilliant\r\nblue or orange in color, usually about six inches long, and bearing on\r\nits upper surface which projects above the water a raised\r\nparti-colored crest, and on its under surface a tangle of various\r\nappendages, thread-like with grape-like clusters of little bell- or\r\npear-shaped bodies. Each of these parts is a peculiarly modified\r\npolyp- or medusa-zooid produced by budding from an original central\r\nzooid. The Portuguese man-of-war is very common in tropical oceans,\r\nand sometimes vast numbers swimming together make the surface of the\r\nocean look like a splendid flower-garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--A colonial jellyfish (Siphonophora). (After\r\nHaeckel.)]\r\n\r\nUsually the central zooid in a Siphonophore to which the other zooids\r\nare attached is not a bladder-like float, but is an upright tube of\r\ngreater or less length. In the Siphonophore shown in figure 14, the\r\ncompound body is composed of a long central hollow stem with hundreds\r\nor thousands of variously shaped parts, each of which is reducible to\r\neither a polyp or medusazooid, attached around it. The upper end is\r\nenlarged to form an air-filled chamber, a sac-like boat, by means of\r\nwhich the whole colony is kept afloat. Around the upper end of the\r\ncentral stem are many medusoid structures, the swimming-bells, by\r\nmeans of whose opening and closing the whole colony is made to swim\r\nthrough the water. Each swimming-bell is a modified medusa-zooid,\r\nwithout tentacles, without digestive or reproductive organs, but\r\nexercising the power of swimming by contracting and forcing the water\r\nout of the hollow bell just as is done by the free medusæ. Below the\r\nswimming-bells, at the lower end of the central stem, are grouped many\r\nstructures presenting at first sight a confusion of variety and\r\ncomplexity, but on careful examination revealing themselves to be\r\npolyp- and medusa-zooids modified to form at least five kinds of\r\nparticularly functioning structures. There are many flattened\r\nscale-like parts whose function is simply that of affording a passive\r\nprotection, in times of danger, to the other structures. These\r\nprotecting-scales are greatly modified medusa-zooids, each consisting\r\nof a simple cartilage-like gelatinous mass penetrated by a\r\nfood-carrying canal. Under the broad leaves of these protecting-zooids\r\nare a number of pear-shaped bodies which have a wide octagonal\r\nmouth-opening at their free end, and possess in their interior certain\r\ndigestive glands. Each one is provided with a very long flexible\r\ntentacle which bears many fine stinging-threads. The tentacle waves\r\nback and forth in the water, and on coming in contact with an enemy or\r\nwith prey its poisonous stinging-threads shoot out and paralyze or\r\nwound the unfortunate animal. These pear-shaped bodies are the feeding\r\nstructures, each being a modified polyp-zooid. Scattered among these\r\ndangerous structures are many somewhat similarly shaped but wholly\r\nharmless structures, the sense-structures. Each of these has a\r\npear-shaped body but without mouth-opening, and also a long, very\r\nsensitive, tentacle-like process. The sense of feeling is highly\r\ndeveloped in these tentacles, and they discover for the colony the\r\npresence of any strange body. These sense-structures are modified\r\npolyp-zooids. Finally there are two other kinds of structures, usually\r\narranged in groups like bunches of grapes, which are the reproductive\r\nstructures, male and female. They are modified medusa-zooids grown\r\ntogether and without tentacles. This whole colony, or this compound\r\nanimal, floats or swims about at the surface of the ocean, and\r\nperforms all of the necessary functions of life as a single animal\r\ncomposed of organs might. Yet the Siphonophore is more truly to be\r\nregarded as a community in which the hundreds or thousands of animals,\r\nrepresenting five or six kinds of individuals, all of one species, are\r\nfastened together. Each individual performs the particular duties\r\ndevolving upon its kind or class. Thus there are food-gathering\r\nindividuals, locomotor individuals, sense individuals, and\r\nreproductive individuals. The modifications of the various kinds of\r\nindividuals are more extreme than in the case of the various kinds of\r\nindividuals composing a bee-community, for example, but the holding\r\ntogether or fusing of all into one body or corporation is a condition\r\nwhich makes this greater modification necessary and not unexpected.\r\nAnd there is no difficulty in seeing that each of these parts is\r\nreally, structurally considered, a modified polyp or medusa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--A jellyfish or medusa, _Gonionema vertens_,\r\neating two small fishes. (From specimen from Atlantic Coast.)]\r\n\r\n=The large jellyfishes, etc. (Scyphozoa).=--To the class Scyphozoa\r\nbelong most of the common large jellyfishes. When one walks along the\r\nsea-beach soon after a storm one may find many shapeless masses of a\r\nclear jelly-like substance scattered here and there on the sand. These\r\nare the bodies or parts of bodies of jellyfishes which have been cast up\r\nby the waves. Exposed to the sun and wind the jelly-like mass soon dries\r\nor evaporates away to a small shrivelled mass. The body-substance of a\r\njellyfish contains a very large proportion of water; in fact there is\r\nhardly more than 1 per cent of solid matter in it.\r\n\r\nThe jellyfishes occur in great numbers on the surface of the ocean and\r\nare familiar to sailors under the name of \"sea-bulbs.\" Some live in\r\nthe deeper waters; a few specimens have been dredged up from depths of\r\na mile below the surface. They range in size from \"umbrellas\" or disks\r\na few millimeters in diameter to disks of a diameter of two meters\r\n(2-1/6 yards). They are all carnivorous, preying on other small ocean\r\nanimals which they catch by means of their tentacles provided with\r\nstinging-threads. The tentacles of some of the largest jellyfishes\r\n\"reach the astonishing length of 40 meters, or about 130 feet.\" Many\r\nof the jellyfishes are beautifully colored, although all are nearly\r\ntransparent. Almost all of them are phosphorescent, and when irritated\r\nsome emit a very strong light.\r\n\r\n=The sea-anemones and corals (Actinozoa).=--Almost everywhere along\r\nthe seashore where there are rocks and tide-pools a host of various\r\nkinds of sea-anemones can be found. When the tide is out, exposing the\r\ndripping seaweed-covered rocks, and the little sand- or stone-floored\r\nbasins are left filled with clear sea-water, the brown and green and\r\npurple \"sea-flowers\" may be found fixed to the rocks by the base with\r\nthe mouth-opening and circlet of slowly-moving tentacles hungrily\r\nready for food (fig. 16). Touch the fringe of tentacles with your\r\nfingertip and feel how they cling to it and see how they close in so\r\nas to carry what they feel into the mouth-opening. A host of\r\nindividuals there are, and scores of different kinds; some small,\r\nsome large, some with the body covered outside with tiny bits of stone\r\nand shell so that they are hardly to be distinguished from the rock to\r\nwhich they cling; some of bright and showy colors. These are the most\r\nfamiliar members of the class Actinozoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Sea anemones, _Bunodes californica_, open and\r\nclosed individuals. The closed individuals in upper right-hand corner\r\nshow the external covering of small bits of rock and shell,\r\ncharacteristic of most individuals of this species. (From living\r\nspecimens in a tide-pool on the Bay of Monterey, California.)]\r\n\r\nBut in other oceans, along the coasts of other lands, especially those\r\nof the tropics and sub-tropics, there are some other members of the\r\nclass which are of unusual interest. They are the corals, or coral\r\npolyps. We know these animals chiefly by their skeletons (fig. 17).\r\nThe specimens of corals which one sees in collections, or made into\r\nornaments, are the calcareous skeletons of various kinds of the coral\r\npolyps. Some of the corals live together in enormous numbers, forming\r\nbranching colonies fixed as closely together as possible, and secrete\r\nwhile living a stony skeleton of carbonate of lime. These skeletons\r\npersist after the death of the animals, and because of their abundance\r\nand close massing form great reefs or banks and islands. These coral\r\nreefs and islands occur only in the warmer oceans. In the Atlantic\r\nthey are found along the coasts of Southern Florida, Brazil and the\r\nWest Indies; in the Pacific and Indian Oceans there are great coral\r\nreefs on the coast of Australia, Madagascar and elsewhere, and certain\r\nlarge groups of inhabited islands like the Fiji, Society, and Friendly\r\nIslands are exclusively of coral formation. Coral islands have a great\r\nvariety of form, although the elongated, circular, ring-shaped and\r\ncrescent forms predominate. How such islands are first formed is\r\ndescribed as follows by a well-known student of corals:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Skeleton of a branching coral, _Madrepora\r\ncervicornis_. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\n\"A growing coral plantation, with its multitudinous life, oftentimes\r\narises from great depths of the ocean, and the sea-bed upon which it\r\nrests is probably a submarine bank or mountain, upon which have lodged\r\nand slowly aggregated the hard skeletons of pelagic forms of life.\r\nWhen, through various sources of increase, this submarine bank\r\napproaches the depth of from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet\r\nfrom the surface of the water, there begins on its top a most\r\nwonderful vital activity. It is then within the bathymetric zone of\r\nthe reef-building corals. Of the many groups of marine life which then\r\ntake possession of the bank, corals are not the only animals, but\r\nthey are the most important, as far as its subsequent history goes. As\r\nthe bank slowly rises by their growth, it at last approaches the\r\nsurface of the water, and at low tide the tips of the growing branches\r\nof coral are exposed to the air. This, however, only takes place in\r\nsheltered localities, for long before it has reached this elevation it\r\nhas begun to be more or less changed and broken by the force of the\r\nwaves. As the submarine bank approaches the tide level, the delicate\r\nbranching forms have to meet a terrific wave-action. Fragments of the\r\nbranching corals are broken off from the bank by force of the waves,\r\nand falling down into the midst of the growing coral below fill up the\r\ninterstices, and thus render the whole mass more compact. At the same\r\ntime larger fragments are broken and rolled about by the waves and are\r\neventually washed up into banks upon the coral plantation, so that the\r\nisland now appears slightly elevated above the tides. This may be\r\ncalled a first stage in the development of a coral island. It is,\r\nhowever, little more than a low ridge of worn fragments of coral\r\nwashed by the high tides and swept by the larger waves--a low, narrow\r\nisland resting on a large submarine bank.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the coral island rises thus a little above the surface of the\r\nwater, the waves break up some of the coral into fine sand, which fills\r\nin the interstices, and offers a sort of soil in which may germinate\r\nseeds brought in the dried mud on the feet of ocean birds or carried by\r\nthe ocean currents. With the beginning of vegetable growth the soil is\r\nmore firmly held, is fertilized and ready for the seeds of plants which\r\nneed a better soil than lime sand. Flying insects find their way to the\r\nisland, especially if it be near the mainland, birds begin to nest on\r\nit, and soon it may be the seat of a luxuriant plant and animal life.\r\n\r\nFor an account of coral islands see Darwin's \"The Structure and\r\nDistribution of Coral Reefs.\"\r\n\r\nThere are over 2000 kinds of coral polyp known, and their skeletons\r\nvary much in appearance. Because of the appearance of the skeleton\r\ncertain corals have received common names, as the organ-pipe coral,\r\nbrain coral, etc. The red coral, of which jewelry is made, grows\r\nchiefly in the Mediterranean. It is gathered especially on the western\r\ncoast of Italy, and on the coasts of Sicily and Sardinia. Most of this\r\ncoral is sent to Naples, where it is cut into ornaments.\r\n\r\nThere are other interesting members of the class Actinozoa like the\r\nbeautiful sea-pens, sea-feathers and sea-fans, delicate, branching,\r\ntree-like forms found all over the world.\r\n\r\n=Ctenophora.=--The members of this class are mostly small, peculiar\r\njellyfishes which do not form colonies, and are extremely delicate,\r\nbeing usually perfectly transparent. They swim by means of cilia. They\r\nnever appear in a polyp condition, but are always medusoid in shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                   BRANCH ECHINODERMATA: STARFISHES,\r\n                       SEA-URCHINS, SEA-CUCUMBERS\r\n\r\n                       STARFISH (_Asterias_ sp.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The species of _Asterias_ are widely distributed\r\n    on both coasts of the United States and may be procured on almost\r\n    any rocky shore at low tide. Teachers in inland schools can obtain\r\n    preserved material from the dealers mentioned on p. 453. Most of\r\n    the specimens should be placed in alcohol or 4% formalin. If fresh\r\n    material can be had it is well to place at least one specimen for\r\n    each student in a 20% solution of nitric acid in water for two or\r\n    three hours, when all of the calcareous parts will have been\r\n    dissolved, and after a thorough washing the specimen will be ready\r\n    for use.\r\n\r\n=External structure= (figs. 18 and 19.)--In a fresh specimen or one\r\nwhich has been preserved in alcohol or formalin note the raying out of\r\nparts of the body from a common centre. This is characteristic of the\r\nbody organization of all Echinoderms, and is known as _radial symmetry_.\r\nThe lower surface of the body is called the _oral_ (because the mouth is\r\non this surface), while the upper is called the _aboral_ surface. The\r\ncentral part of the body is called the _disk_. Note on the aboral\r\nsurface of the disk a small striated calcareous plate, the _madreporite_\r\nor _madreporic plate_. In the middle (or very nearly in the middle) of\r\nthis surface of the disk there is a small pore, the _anal opening_. The\r\nentire aboral surface as well as a greater part of the oral side is\r\nthickly studded with the calcareous _ossicles_ of the body-wall. These\r\nossicles support numerous short stout _spines_ arranged in irregular\r\nrows. Note that some of the ossicles support certain very small\r\npincer-like processes, the _pedicellariæ_. In the interspaces between\r\nthe calcareous plates are soft fringe-like projections of the inner\r\nbody-lining, the _respiratory cæca_. Note at the tip of each arm or ray\r\na cluster of small calcareous ossicles and within each cluster a small\r\nspeck of red pigment, the eye-spot or _ocellus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Dissection of a starfish (_Asterias_ sp.).]\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the aboral surface showing all these parts.\r\n\r\nOn the oral surface note the centrally-located _mouth_, the\r\n_ambulacral grooves_, one running longitudinally along each ray, and\r\nin each groove two double rows of soft tubular bodies with sucker-like\r\ntips. These are called the _tube-feet_ and are organs of locomotion.\r\nMake a drawing of the oral surface.\r\n\r\n    =Internal structure= (figs. 18 and 19).--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Take a\r\n    specimen which has been immersed for some time in the nitric acid\r\n    solution, and with a strong pair of scissors, or better,\r\n    bone-cutters, cut away all the aboral wall of the disk except that\r\n    immediately around the madreporite and the anus. Now begin at the\r\n    tip of each ray and cut away the aboral wall of each, leaving,\r\n    however, a single arm intact. When the roof of each arm has been\r\n    carefully dissected away the specimen should appear as in fig. 18.\r\n\r\nNote the large _alimentary canal_, which is divided into several\r\nregions. Note the short _œsophagus_ leading from the _mouth_ on the\r\noral surface directly into a large membranous pouch, the _cardiac_\r\nportion of the _stomach_. By a short constriction the cardiac portion\r\nis separated from the part which lies just above, i.e., the _pyloric_\r\nportion of the stomach. From the pyloric portion large, pointed,\r\npaired glandular appendages extend into each ray. These are the\r\n_pyloric cæca_. Their function is digestive, and oftentimes they are\r\nspoken of as the _digestive glands_ or \"livers.\" The pyloric cæca, as\r\nwell as the cardiac portion of the stomach, are held in place by\r\npaired muscles which extend into each arm. Note two sets of these\r\nmuscles, one set for thrusting the cardiac portion of the stomach out\r\nthrough the mouth and another for pulling it back, the _protractor\r\nmuscles_ and _retractor muscles_, respectively. The starfish obtains\r\nits food by enclosing it in its everted stomach and then withdrawing\r\nstomach and food into the body. Note that the pyloric portion of the\r\nstomach opens above into a short _intestine_ terminating in the\r\n_anus_, and observe that there is attached to the intestine a\r\nconvoluted many-branched tube, the _intestinal cæcum_.\r\n\r\nCarefully remove a pair of pyloric cæca from one of the rays and note\r\nthe short duct which connects them with the pyloric chamber of the\r\nstomach. Note in the angle of each two adjoining rays paired glandular\r\nmasses which empty by a common duct on the aboral surface. These\r\nglands are the _reproductive organs_. Note the small bulb-like\r\nbladders extending in two double rows on the floor of each ray. These\r\nare the water-sacs or _ampullæ_, and each one is connected directly\r\nwith one of the locomotor organs, the tube-feet.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the organs in the dissection which have so far been\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--For a careful study of the locomotor organs a fresh\r\n    starfish should be injected. This can usually be accomplished by\r\n    cutting one ray off squarely, and inserting the needle of a\r\n    hypodermic syringe (which has been previously filled with a watery\r\n    solution of carmine or Berlin blue), into the end of the radial\r\n    water-tube which runs along the floor of the ray. By injecting here,\r\n    the whole system of vessels, tube-feet, and ampullæ are filled.\r\n\r\nNote a ring-shaped canal which passes around the alimentary canal near\r\nthe mouth from which radial vessels run out beneath the floor of each\r\nray and from which a hard tube extends to the madreporite. This hard\r\ntube is the _stone canal_, so called because its walls contain a series\r\nof calcareous rings, while the circular tube is the _ring canal_ or\r\n_circum-oral water-ring_ from which radiate the _radial canals_. In some\r\nspecies of starfish there are bladder-like reservoirs, _Polian\r\nvesicles_, which extend interradially from the ring canal.\r\n\r\nNote that the ampullæ and tube-feet are all connected with the radial\r\ncanals. By a contraction of the delicate muscles in the walls of the\r\nampullæ the fluid in the cavity is compressed, thereby forcing the\r\ntube-feet out. By the contraction of muscles in the tube-feet they are\r\nagain shortened while the small disk-like terminal sucker clings to\r\nsome firm object. In this way the animal pulls itself along by\r\nsuccessive \"steps.\" This entire system, called the _water-vascular\r\nsystem_, is characteristic of the branch Echinodermata. In addition to\r\nthe fluid in the water-vascular system there is yet another\r\nbody-fluid, the _perivisceral fluid_, which bathes all of the tissues\r\nand fills the body-cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Semi-diagrammatic figure of cross-section of\r\nthe ray of a starfish, _Asterias_ sp.]\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Take a drop of the perivisceral fluid from a\r\n    living starfish and examine under high power of microscope, noting\r\n    the amœboid cells it contains.\r\n\r\nThe perivisceral fluid is aerated through outpocketings of the thin\r\nbody-wall which extend outward between the calcareous plates of the\r\nbody. These outpocketings have already been mentioned as the\r\nrespiratory cæca (see p. 109). Surrounding the stone canal is a thin\r\nmembranous tube, and within it and by the side of the stone canal is a\r\nsoft tubular sac. The function of these organs is not certainly known.\r\n\r\nWork out the _nervous system_; note, as its principal parts, a\r\nnerve-ring about the mouth, and nerves running from this ring beneath\r\nthe radial canals along each arm.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The starfishes are all marine forms. They\r\nhatch from eggs, and in their early stages are very different in\r\nappearance from the adults. At first they are bilaterally symmetrical,\r\ntheir radial symmetry being acquired later. Thousands of eggs and\r\nsperm-cells are extruded into the sea-water, where fertilization and\r\ndevelopment take place. The young swim freely in the open sea, feeding\r\non microscopic organisms, and then undergo very radical changes in the\r\ncourse of their development. The adults are for the most part\r\ncarnivorous, feeding on crabs, snails, and the like. The live prey is\r\nsurrounded by the extruded stomach which secretes fluids that kill it,\r\nafter which the soft parts are digested. (See general account of the\r\nlife-history of Echinoderms on p. 119.)\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE SEA-URCHIN (_Strongylocentrotus_ sp.)\r\n\r\n    =External structure.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--If fresh or alcoholic\r\n    specimens or even the dry \"tests\" of the sea-urchin (fig. 20) are\r\n    to be had, the general characteristics of the external structure\r\n    can be made out.\r\n\r\nHow does the external surface of the sea-urchin differ from that of\r\nthe starfish? Can you find the very long _tube-feet_? Where is the\r\nmouth-opening? With what is it surrounded? Each tooth is enclosed in a\r\ncalcareous framework. The whole structure is known as \"_Aristotle's\r\nlantern_.\"\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Remove the spines from the underlying shell or\r\n    test (fig. 21) and wash the test until perfectly clean, or place\r\n    in a solution of lye for a short time and then wash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--A sea-urchin, _Strongylocentrotus\r\nfranciscanus_. (From specimen from Bay of Monterey, Calif.)]\r\n\r\nNote the characteristic radial symmetry of the _shell_ or _test_. Note\r\non the aboral aspect, diverging from the medial anal aperture, five\r\ndouble rows of pores. What are these for? Each of the five divisions\r\nset with pores is called an _ambulacral area_, while the intervening\r\nsegments which support the long spines are called the _interambulacral\r\nareas_. Note on the aboral surface, surrounding the median-placed anal\r\naperture, a series of small plates. Those which are located in the\r\ninterambulacral areas are the _genital plates_. Through these plates\r\nthe ducts from the reproductive organs open by small pores. Note a\r\nvery much enlarged plate with a striated appearance. This is the\r\n_madreporite_, which, as in the starfish, is the external opening of\r\nthe stone canal and water-vascular system. Note the small _ocular\r\nplate_ at the tip of each ambulacral area. The ocular plates contain\r\nsmall pigment-cells and communicate with the nervous system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--\"Test\" of sea-urchin, _Strongylocentrotus\r\nfranciscanus_, with spines removed. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nFrom a general inspection of the sea-urchin's shell the Echinoderm\r\ncharacteristics, namely, radial symmetry and the presence of the\r\nwater-vascular system, are readily seen. While at first glance there\r\nis apparent little similarity between the starfish and sea-urchin,\r\nnevertheless careful examination shows that the two animals are alike\r\nin their fundamental structure. Both are radially symmetrical. The\r\nposition of the anal opening makes both starfish and sea-urchin\r\nslightly asymmetrical. In both the madreporite and anus are on the\r\naboral side, while the mouth is centrally located on the oral side. In\r\nthe starfish we noted five ambulacral areas, one on the under side of\r\neach arm; similarly we find five in the sea-urchin. In both cases also\r\nwe find the ocular spots at the tips of the ambulacral areas. The\r\ngenital apertures are situated interradially in the starfish. In the\r\nsea-urchin they are similarly placed. The dissimilarity between the\r\ntwo forms is largely due to the very much developed outer spines and\r\nthe dorso-ventral thickening of the disk in the sea-urchin. The\r\nstarfish is carnivorous, while the sea-urchin lives on vegetable\r\nmatter consisting for the most part of green algæ and the red\r\nsea-weeds. Correlated with this difference in food-habits there are\r\ncertain differences in the structure of the internal organs. For\r\nexample, the alimentary canal in the sea-urchin winds in about two and\r\none-half turns within the body-cavity before it reaches the anus.\r\n\r\n\r\n             OTHER STARFISHES, SEA-URCHINS, SEA-CUCUMBERS,\r\n                                  ETC.\r\n\r\nWithout exception all the Echinoderms, under which term are included\r\nthe starfishes, sea-urchins, brittle-stars, feather-stars, and\r\nsea-cucumbers, live in the ocean. Some of them, the starfishes and\r\nsea-urchins, are among the most common and familiar animals of the\r\nseashore. Most of them are not fixed, but can move about freely,\r\nthough slowly. Some of the feather-stars are fixed, as the sponges and\r\npolyps are.\r\n\r\n=Shape and organization of body.=--The body-shape of the Echinoderm\r\nvaries from the flat, rayed body of the starfish to the thick,\r\nflattened egg-shape of the sea-urchin, the melon-like sac of the\r\nsea-cucumber and the delicate many-branched head of the sea-lily\r\nsometimes borne on a slender stalk. But in all these shapes can be\r\nseen more or less plainly a symmetrical, radiate arrangement of the\r\nparts of the body. The Echinoderm body has a central portion from\r\nwhich radiate separate arm or branch-like parts, as in the starfishes\r\nand sea-lilies, or about which are arranged radiately the internal\r\nbody-parts, although the external appearance may at first sight give\r\nno plain indication of the radiate arrangement. This is the case with\r\nthe sea-urchins and sea-cucumbers, yet, as has been seen in the\r\nsea-urchin, the radiate arrangement can be readily perceived by closer\r\nexamination of the surface of the egg- or sac-like body. The radiating\r\nparts of the body are usually five. In the body of an Echinoderm can\r\nbe usually recognized an upper or dorsal surface and a lower or\r\nventral surface. The mouth is usually situated on the ventral side and\r\nthe anal opening on the dorsal. Echinoderms agree also in having a\r\ncalcareous outer skeleton or body-wall usually in the condition of\r\ndefinitely-shaped plates or spicules fitted either movably or rigidly\r\ntogether. This outer body-wall or exoskeleton may bear many tubercles\r\nor spines. These spines are sometimes movable. The body-wall of the\r\nsea-urchin shows very well the exoskeleton composed of plates on which\r\nare borne movable strong spines.\r\n\r\n=Structure and organs.=--As has been learned from the dissection of\r\nthe starfish, the Echinoderms have well-developed systems of organs.\r\nThe body-structure in its complex organization presents a marked\r\nadvance beyond the structural condition of the polyps and jellyfishes.\r\nThere is a well-organized digestive system with mouth, alimentary\r\ncanal, and anal opening. The alimentary canal is either a simple\r\nspiral or coiled tube, or it is a tube in which can be recognized\r\ndifferent parts, namely, œsophagus, stomach, intestine, cæca, and\r\nspecial glands secreting digestive fluids. This alimentary canal is\r\nnot, as in the polyps, simply the body-cavity, but it is an inclosed\r\ntubular cavity lying within the general body-cavity. At the\r\nmouth-opening there is in some Echinoderms, notably the sea-urchins, a\r\nstrong masticating apparatus consisting of five pointed teeth which\r\nare arranged in a circle about the opening. The nervous system\r\nconsists of a central ring around the œsophagus or mouth, from which\r\nbranches extend into the radiately arranged arms or regions of the\r\nbody. There is no brain as in the higher animals, but the central\r\nnerve-ring is composed of both nerve-cells and nerve-fibres as in the\r\nnerve-centres of higher forms. Of organs of special sense there are\r\nspecial tactile or touch organs in all the Echinoderms, and the\r\nstarfishes have very simply composed eyes or eye-like organs at the\r\ntips of the rays.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the Echinoderms breathe simply through the outer\r\nbody-wall, taking up by osmosis the air mixed with the water, some of\r\nthem have special, though very simple, gill-like respiratory organs.\r\nThese organs consist of small membranous sacs which are either pushed\r\nout from the body into the water, or lie in cavities in the body to\r\nwhich the water has access. There is also a distinct circulatory\r\nsystem, but the \"blood\" which is carried by these organs and which\r\nfills the body-cavity consists mainly of sea-water, although\r\ncontaining a number of amœboid corpuscles containing a brown pigment.\r\nThere is no organ really corresponding to the heart of the higher\r\nanimals. There are distinct organs for the production of the germ or\r\nreproductive cells. The sexes are distinct (except in a few species),\r\neach individual producing only sperm-cells or egg-cells, but the\r\norgans or glands which produce the germ-cells are very much alike in\r\nboth sexes. There is no apparent difference between male and female\r\nEchinoderms except in the character or rather in the product of the\r\ngerm-cell producing organs. A few species are exceptions, certain\r\nstarfishes showing a difference in color between males and females.\r\n\r\nAs all of the Echinoderms except some of the feather-stars can move\r\nabout, they have organs of locomotion, and well-defined muscles for\r\nthe movement of the locomotory organs. The external organs of\r\nlocomotion, the tube-feet (in the sea-urchins the dermal spines aid\r\nalso in locomotion), are parts of a peculiar system of organs\r\ncharacteristic of the Echinoderms, called the ambulacral or the\r\nwater-vascular system. This system is composed of a series of radial\r\ntubular vessels which rise from a central circular or ring vessel and\r\nwhich give off branches to each of the tube-feet. The water from the\r\noutside enters the ambulacral system through a special opening, the\r\nmadreporic opening, and flowing to the tube-feet helps extend them.\r\nThe tube-feet usually have a tiny sucking disk at the tip, and by\r\nmeans of them the Echinoderm can cling very firmly to rocks.\r\n\r\n=Development and life-history.=--Differing from the sponges and the\r\npolyps and jellyfishes, the reproduction of the Echinoderms is always\r\nsexual; young or new individuals are never produced by budding, or in\r\nany other asexual way. The new individual is always developed from an\r\negg produced by a female and fertilized by the sperm of a male. The eggs\r\nare usually red or yellow, are very small (about 1/50 in. in diameter in\r\ncertain starfishes), and are fertilized by the sperm-cells of the males\r\nafter leaving the body of the female. That is, both sperm-cells and\r\nunfertilized egg-cells are poured out into the water by the adults, and\r\nthe motile sperm-cells in some way find and fertilize the egg-cells.\r\n\r\nFrom the egg there hatches a tiny larva which does not at all resemble\r\nthe parent starfish or sea-urchin. It is an active free-swimming\r\ncreature, more or less ellipsoidal in shape and provided with cilia\r\nfor swimming. Soon its body changes form and assumes a very curious\r\nshape with prominent projections. The larvæ of the various kinds of\r\nEchinoderms, as the starfishes, sea-urchins, sea-cucumbers, etc., are\r\nof different characteristic shapes. The naturalists who first\r\ndiscovered these odd little animals did not associate them in their\r\nminds with the very differently shaped starfishes and sea-urchins, but\r\nbelieved them new kinds of fully developed marine animals, and gave\r\nthem names. Thus the larvæ of the starfishes were called Bipinnaria,\r\nthe larvæ of the sea-urchins Pluteus, and so on. These names are still\r\nused to designate the larvæ, but with the knowledge that Bipinnaria\r\nare simply young starfishes, and that a Pluteus is simply a young\r\nsea-urchin. From these larval stages the adult or fully developed\r\nstarfish or sea-urchin develops by very great changes or\r\nmetamorphoses. The Echinoderms have in their life-history a\r\nmetamorphosis as striking as the butterflies and moths, which are\r\ncrawling worm-like caterpillars in their young or larval condition.\r\n\r\nMost of the Echinoderms have the power of regenerating lost parts.\r\nThat is, if a starfish loses an arm (ray) through accident, a new ray\r\nwill grow out to replace the old. And this power of regeneration\r\nextends so far in the case of some starfishes that if very badly\r\nmutilated they can practically regenerate the whole body. This amounts\r\nto a kind of asexual reproduction. Some species, too, have the\r\npeculiar habit of self-mutilation. \"Many brittle stars and some\r\nstarfishes when removed from the water, or when molested in any way,\r\nbreak off portions of their arms piece by piece, until, it may be, the\r\nwhole of them are thrown off to the very bases, leaving the central\r\ndisc entirely bereft of arms. A central disc thus partly or completely\r\ndeprived of its arms is capable in many cases of developing a new set;\r\nand a separated arm is capable in many cases of developing a new disc\r\nand a completed series of arms.\" In some of the sea-cucumbers \"it is\r\nthe internal organs, or rather portions of them, that are capable of\r\nbeing thrown off and replaced, the œsophagus ... or the entire\r\nalimentary canal, being ejected from the body by strong contractions\r\nof the muscular fibres of the body-wall, and in some cases, at least,\r\nafterwards becoming completely renewed.\"\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The Echinodermata are divided into five classes,\r\nviz., the Asteroidea or starfishes, \"free Echinoderms with star-shaped\r\nor pentagonal body, in which a central disc and usually five arms are\r\nmore or less readily distinguishable, the arms being hollow and each\r\ncontaining a prolongation of the body-cavity and contained organs\";\r\nthe Ophiuroidea, or brittle-stars, \"star-shaped free Echinoderms, with\r\na central disc and five arms, which are more sharply marked off from\r\nthe disc than in the Asteroidea and which contain no spacious\r\nprolongations of the body-cavity\"; the Echinoidea, or sea-urchins,\r\n\"free Echinoderms with globular, heart-shaped, or disc-shaped body\r\nenclosed in a shell or corona of close-fitting, firmly united\r\ncalcareous plates\"; the Holothuroidea, or sea-cucumbers, \"free\r\nEchinoderms with elongated cylindrical or five-sided body, ... with a\r\ncirclet of large oral tentacles\"; and the Crinoidea, or feather-stars,\r\n\"temporarily or permanently stalked Echinoderms with star-shaped body,\r\nconsisting of a central disc, and a series of five bifurcate or more\r\ncompletely branched arms, bordered with pinnules.\"\r\n\r\n=Starfishes (Asteroidea).=--The starfishes feed on other marine\r\nanimals, especially shell-fish and crabs. They are also reputed to\r\ndestroy young fish. By means of their sucking-tubes, or tube-feet with\r\nsucker tips, they can seize and hold their prey firmly. They do much\r\ninjury to oyster-beds by attacking and devouring the oysters. When\r\nattacking prey too large to be taken into the mouth the starfish\r\neverts its stomach over the prey and devours it. The stomach is\r\nafterward drawn back into the body-cavity by special muscles.\r\n\r\nStarfishes vary much in size, color and general appearance, although\r\nall are readily recognizable as starfishes (fig. 22). The number of\r\narms or rays varies from five to thirty or more in different species;\r\nsome have the interradial spaces filled out nearly to the tips of the\r\nrays, making the animal simply a pentagonal disc. In size starfishes\r\nvary from a fraction of an inch in diameter to three feet; in color\r\nthey are yellow or red or brown or purple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A group of Echinoderms; the upper one, a\r\nstarfish, _Asterina mineata_, the one at the right a starfish,\r\n_Asterias ocracia_, at the left a brittle-star, species unknown, and\r\nat bottom two sea-urchins, _Strongylocentrotus franciscanus_. (From\r\nliving specimens in a tide-pool on the Bay of Monterey, California.)]\r\n\r\n=Brittle-stars (Ophiuroidea).=--The brittle-stars, or serpent-stars\r\n(fig. 22) as they are also called, resemble the starfishes in external\r\nappearance, that is, they are flat and composed of a central disc with\r\nradiating arms (always five in number, although each arm may be\r\nseveral times branched). The central disc is always sharply\r\ndistinguished from the arms, and the arms are usually slender and more\r\nor less cylindrical. The distinguishing difference between the\r\nbrittle-stars and the starfishes is that the body-cavity and the\r\nstomach which extend out into the arms in the starfishes are in the\r\nbrittle-stars limited to the central disc, or to the disc and bases of\r\nthe arms. The tube-feet also have no suckers at the tips. More than\r\n700 species of brittle-stars are known. They feed on marine\r\nshell-fish, crabs and worms.\r\n\r\n=Sea-urchins (Echinoidea).=--The sea-urchins (figs. 20, 21 and 22) of\r\nwhich more than 300 species are known, have no arms or rays, and they\r\nare usually not flat like the starfishes but globular, with poles more\r\nor less flattened. As has been noted in the examination of the body-wall\r\nor \"shell,\" the radiate character of the body is shown by the five\r\nradiating zones of tube-feet. The mouth, with its five strong \"teeth,\"\r\nis on the ventral surface, and the anal opening and madreporic opening\r\nare on the dorsal surface. The calcareous plates (seen distinctly in a\r\nspecimen from which the spines have been removed) which constitute the\r\nfirm part of the body-wall, are more or less pentagonal in shape and are\r\nusually firmly united at the edges. The spines which are so\r\ncharacteristic of the sea-urchins vary much in size and number and\r\nfirmness, but are present in some form on all of them.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the sea-urchins live near the shore, being very common\r\nin tide-pools, some live only on the bottom of the ocean at great\r\ndepths. Their food consists of small marine animals and of bits of\r\norganic matter which they collect from the sand and débris of the\r\nocean floor. Many of the sea-urchins are gregarious, living together\r\nin great numbers. Some have the habit of boring into the rocks of the\r\nshore between tide-lines. I have seen thousands of small beautifully\r\ncolored purple sea-urchins lying each in a spherical pit or hole in\r\nhard conglomerate rock on the California coast. How they are enabled\r\nto bore these holes is not yet known. There is great variety in size\r\nand color among the sea-urchins. The colors are brown, olive, purple\r\nred, greenish blue, etc.\r\n\r\nA few kinds of sea-urchins have a flexible shell or test. The\r\nChallenger expedition dredged up from sea-bottom some sea-urchins, and\r\nwhen placed on the ship's deck \"the test moved and shrank from touch\r\nwhen handled, and felt like a starfish.\" The cake-urchins or\r\nsand-dollars are sea-urchins having a very flat body with short\r\nspines. They lie buried in the sand, and are often very brightly\r\ncolored. Their hollow bleached tests with the spines all rubbed off\r\nare common on the sands of both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\r\n\r\n=Sea-cucumbers (Holothuroidea).=--The sea-cucumbers (fig. 23) show at\r\nfirst glance little resemblance to the other radiate animals. The body\r\nis an elongate, sub-cylindrical sac, resembling a thick worm or\r\nsausage or cucumber in shape. At one end it bears a group of branched\r\ntentacles which are set in a ring around the mouth-opening. The\r\nbody-wall is muscular and leathery, but contains many small separated\r\ncalcareous spicules. There are usually five longitudinal rows of\r\ntube-feet. In some species, however, tube feet are wholly wanting; in\r\nothers they are scattered over the surface.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are known about five hundred species of sea-cucumbers\r\nmany of which live along the shores, they are much less familiar to us\r\nthan the starfishes and sea-urchins. They usually rest buried in the\r\nsand by day, feeding at night. Some of them attain a large size. A\r\ngreat orange-red species of the genus _Cucumaria_, which is found in\r\nthe Bay of Monterey, California, is three feet long.\r\n\r\nThe people of some nations use sea-cucumbers as food. They are called\r\n\"trepang\" in the orient. The trade of preparing the trepang is almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the Malays, and every year large fleets set\r\nsail from Macassar and the Philippines to the south seas to catch\r\nsea-cucumbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--A sea-cucumber, _Pentacta frondosa_. (After\r\nEmerton.)]\r\n\r\n=Feather-stars (Crinoidea).=--The feather-stars or sea-lilies or\r\ncrinoids (fig. 24), as they are variously called, differ from the\r\nother Echinoderms in having the mouth on the upper side of the central\r\ndisc, and in the fact that all of the species are fixed, either\r\npermanently or for a part of their life, being attached to rocks on\r\nthe sea-bottom by a longer or shorter stalk which is composed of a\r\nseries of rings or segments. The central disc is small and the\r\nradiating arms are long, slender, sometimes repeatedly branched, and\r\nall the branches bear fine lateral projections called pinnulæ. Most of\r\nthe feather-stars live in deep water and are thus only seen after\r\nbeing dredged up. They feed on small crab-like animals, and on the\r\nmarine unicellular animals and plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--A crinoid or feather-star, _Pentacrinus_ sp.\r\n(After Brehm.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                      BRANCH VERMES:[8] THE WORMS\r\n\r\n                    THE EARTHWORM (_Lumbricus_ sp.).\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain live earthworms of large size, killing\r\n    some in 30% alcohol and hardening and preserving them in 80%\r\n    alcohol, and bringing others alive to the laboratory. The worms\r\n    may be found during the daytime by digging, or at night by\r\n    searching with a lantern. They often come above ground in the\r\n    daytime after a heavy rain. Live specimens may be kept in the\r\n    laboratory in flower-pots filled with soil. \"They may be fed on\r\n    bits of raw meat, preferably fat, bits of onion, celery, cabbage,\r\n    etc., thrown on the soil.\"\r\n\r\n=External structure= (fig. 25).--Examine the external structure of\r\nlive and dead specimens. Which is the ventral and which the dorsal\r\nsurface? Which the anterior and which the posterior end? Note the\r\nsegmented condition of the body; the number of _segments_ or\r\n_somites_, and their relative size and shape. Note absence of\r\nappendages such as limbs and the presence of _locomotor setæ_ (short\r\nbristles). How many setæ are there on each segment and what is their\r\ndisposition? The _mouth_ is covered by a dorsal projection called the\r\n_prostomium_. The _anal opening_ is situated in the posterior segment\r\nof the body. The broad thickened ring or girdle including several\r\nsegments near the anterior end of the body is the _clitellum_, a\r\nglandular structure which secretes the cases in which the eggs are\r\nlaid. On the ventral surface of the fourteenth and fifteenth segments\r\n(in most species) are two pairs of small pores; two other pairs of\r\nsmall openings (usually difficult to find), one between segments 9 and\r\n10, and one between segments 10 and 11, are present. All these are the\r\nexternal openings of the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Dissection of the earthworm, _Lumbricus_ sp.]\r\n\r\nMake drawings showing the external structure of the earthworm.\r\n\r\nExamine a live specimen placed on moist paper or wood. Note the\r\ncharacteristics of its locomotion, and the movements of its\r\nbody-parts. How do the setæ aid in locomotion?\r\n\r\n    =Internal structure= (figs. 25, 26 and 28).--TECHNICAL NOTE.--With\r\n    a fine-pointed pair of scissors make a dorsal median incision, not\r\n    too deep, behind the clitellum and cut forward as far as the first\r\n    segment. Put the specimen into dissecting-dish, carefully pin back\r\n    the edges of the cut and cover with clear water or, better, 50%\r\n    alcohol.\r\n\r\nNote the long body-cavity divided by the thin _septa_ which have been\r\ntorn away for the most part by the pinning process. Note the thin\r\ntransparent covering of the body, the _cuticle_. Just beneath this\r\nnote a less transparent layer, the _epidermis_, and underneath this a\r\nlayer of muscles. The _muscular layer_ is made up of two clearly\r\nrecognizable sets, an outer circular layer and an inner longitudinal\r\nlayer the fibres of which are continuous with the septa.\r\n\r\nNote, as the most conspicuous internal organ, the long _alimentary\r\ncanal_, of which a number of distinct parts may be recognized. Most\r\nanteriorly is a muscular _pharynx_, which is followed by a narrow\r\n_œsophagus_, leading directly into the thin-walled _crop_; next comes\r\nthe muscular _gizzard_, and next the _intestine_ which opens externally\r\nin the terminal segment through the _anus_. The anterior end of the\r\nalimentary canal is more or less protrusible, while the posterior\r\nportion is held more firmly in place by the septa which act as\r\nmesenteries. Surrounding the narrow œsophagus are the reproductive\r\norgans, three pairs of large white bodies and two pairs of smaller sacs.\r\n\r\nNote the _dorsal blood-vessel_ lying along the dorsal surface of the\r\nalimentary canal, from the anterior portion of which arise several\r\n_circumœsophageal rings_ or \"hearts.\" These hearts are contractile and\r\nserve to keep the blood in motion through the blood-vessels (see\r\nlater). In the most anterior of the body segments note the pear-shaped\r\n_brain_ or _cerebral ganglion_.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Lift carefully to right and left the reproductive\r\n    organs, thus exposing the œsophagus.\r\n\r\nNote three pairs of bag-like structures projecting from the œsophagus.\r\nThe front pair is the _œsophageal pouches_; the next two pairs are the\r\n_œsophageal_ or _calciferous glands_. They communicate with the\r\nalimentary canal, and their secretion is a milky calcareous fluid.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing that will show all the parts so far studied.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Cut transversely through the alimentary canal in\r\n    the region of the clitellum and carefully dissect the anterior\r\n    portion of the canal away from the surrounding organs.\r\n\r\nNote the dorsal fold of the intestine, _typhlosole_, extending into\r\nthe lumen. This fold gives a greater surface for digestion, and in it\r\nare a great many _hepatic_ or special _digestive cells_. The entire\r\nalimentary canal is lined with _epithelium_. Observe just beneath the\r\nalimentary canal the _ventral blood-vessel_, and still beneath this\r\nblood-vessel the _ventral nerve-cord_. There is a slight swelling on\r\nthe nerve-cord in each segment of the body. These swellings are the\r\n_ganglia_. How many pairs of nerves are given off from each ganglion?\r\nObserve in each segment, posterior to the first three or four, the\r\nsuccessive pairs of convoluted tubes, the _nephridia_, or organs of\r\nexcretion. Each nephridium opens internally through a ciliated funnel,\r\nthe _nephrostome_, within the body-cavity, while it opens externally\r\nby a small excretory pore between the setæ on the ventral surface of\r\nthe segment behind that in which the nephridium chiefly lies. The\r\nfunction of the nephridia is to carry off waste matter from the fluid\r\nwhich fills the body-cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Dissection to show alimentary canal in\r\nsection and nephridia of earthworm.]\r\n\r\nTrace the ventral nerve-cord forward to its connection with the\r\ncerebral ganglion. Note the throat nerve-ring or _circumœsophageal\r\ncollar_ connecting the ventral cord with the brain.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the nervous system showing its relation to other\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Cross-section of earthworm.]\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The earthworm lives in soft moist soil\r\nwhich is rich in organic matter. Its food is taken into the mouth\r\nmixed with dirt and sand. As this mixture passes through the long\r\nalimentary canal the organic particles are taken up and digested. As\r\nwe have already seen, there are in each worm two sets of reproductive\r\nglands, namely, male and female organs. Each earthworm produces both\r\negg-cells and sperm-cells, but the sperm-cells of one worm are not\r\nused to fertilize the eggs of the individual producing them. When the\r\neggs are ready to be discharged from the body, the clitellum becomes\r\nvery much swollen and its glands begin an active secretion which\r\nhardens and forms a collar-like structure about the body of the worm.\r\nAs this collar moves forward toward the anterior end of the body it\r\ncollects the eggs and also the sperm-cells previously received from\r\nanother worm, and finally slips off the head end of the animal. The\r\nentire structure with the contained eggs and sperm-cells as it passes\r\noff from the body becomes closed at both ends, thus forming a horny\r\ncapsule which lies in the earth until the young worms emerge. Only a\r\npart of the eggs develop in each capsule, the rest being used as food\r\nfor the growing young. The young earthworms, though of very small\r\nsize, are fully formed before they leave the egg-capsule. Earthworms\r\nare more or less gregarious, large numbers often being found together.\r\n\r\nFor an interesting account of the habits of earthworms see Darwin's\r\n\"The Formation of Vegetable Mold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OTHER WORMS.\r\n\r\nThe branch Vermes comprises so large a number of kinds of animals\r\npresenting such great differences in structure and habit that it is\r\nimpossible to give a brief statement in general or summary terms of\r\ntheir external body-characters, of the structural and functional\r\ncondition of their various organs and systems of organs, and of the\r\ncourse of their development and life-history as has been done for the\r\npreceding branches. Many zoologists, indeed, do not include all the\r\nworms or worm-like animals in one branch, but consider them to form\r\nseveral distinct branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--A group of marine worms: at the left a\r\ngephyrean, _Dendrostomum cronjhelmi_, the upper right-hand one a nereid,\r\n_Nereis_ sp., the lower right-hand one, _Polynoe brevisetosa_. (From\r\nliving specimens in a tide-pool on the Bay of Monterey, California.)]\r\n\r\nIn certain very general characters all of the animals which compose the\r\nbranch Vermes do agree. All, or nearly all, have an elongate body which\r\nis bilaterally symmetrical, that is, which could be cut by a median\r\nlongitudinal cutting in two similar halves. In most of them also the\r\nbody is composed of a number of successive segments or somites which are\r\nmore or less alike. This kind of segmented or articulated body is also\r\npossessed by the insects and crabs. Almost all of the worms have the\r\npower of locomotion; usually that of crawling. For this crawling they do\r\nnot have legs composed of separate segments or joints as do the higher\r\narticulated animals, the crabs and insects, but either have fleshy\r\nunjointed legs, or various kinds of bristles or spines, or suckers, or\r\neven no external organs of locomotion at all. As regards their internal\r\nstructure they have well-organized systems of organs, which show great\r\nvariety in character and degree of complexity. The special sense-organs\r\nare usually of simple character and low degree of functional\r\ndevelopment. Reproduction occurs both sexually and asexually; in some\r\nspecies the sexes are distinct, while in others both sperm-cells and\r\negg-cells are produced by the same individual. Asexual reproduction is\r\nby budding or by a kind of simple division or fission. The worms live\r\neither in salt or fresh water, or in moist, muddy or slimy places or as\r\nparasites in the bodies of other animals or in plants. While most worms\r\nfeed on animal substance either living or dead, some feed on living or\r\ndecaying plant matter.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--There is great lack of agreement among zoologists in\r\nthe matter of the classification of the worms. Not only are the various\r\ngroups which by some are called classes held by others to be distinct\r\nbranches, co-ordinate in rank with the Echinodermata, Cœlenterata, etc.,\r\nbut the limits of these groups are also constantly called in question.\r\nIt will require a great deal better knowledge of the structure and\r\nlife-history of these diverse animals before the matter of their\r\nclassification is satisfactorily settled. We shall consider briefly four\r\nof the various groups (which we may consider as classes) which include\r\nworms either specially familiar to us or of special interest or\r\nimportance. One or two examples of each group (the groups being selected\r\nprimarily because of the examples) will be described in some detail. By\r\nthis means we may get an idea of the extremely diverse character of the\r\nanimals which are included in the heterogeneous branch Vermes.\r\n\r\n=Earthworms and leeches (Oligochætæ).=--The various species of\r\nearthworms, an example of which has been studied are found in all parts\r\nof the world; they occur in Siberia and south to the Kerguelen Islands.\r\nThey are absent from desert or arid regions, and some can live\r\nindifferently either in soil or in water. Some near allies of the\r\nearthworms are aquatic, living in fresh or brackish water, some in salt\r\nwater near the shore. In size earthworms vary from 1 mm. (1/25 in.) to 2\r\nmetres (2-1/6 yds.) in length. All show the distinct segmentation of the\r\nbody noticeable in the common earthworm already studied.\r\n\r\nThe leeches, some of which are familiar animals, are closely related\r\nto the earthworms, although at first glance the similarity in\r\nstructure is not very noticeable.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Some common water-leeches, alive or preserved in\r\n    alcohol, should be examined by the class. The animals are not\r\n    unfamiliar to boys who \"go in swimming\" in the small streams of\r\n    the country. The body of a leech should be examined carefully, and\r\n    drawings of it showing the external structural characters should\r\n    be made.\r\n\r\nThe body of a leech is flattened dorso-ventrally, instead of being\r\ncylindrical as in the earthworm, and tapers at both ends. In the live\r\nanimal the body can be greatly elongated and narrowed or much\r\nshortened and broadened. It is composed of many segments (not as many\r\nas there are cross-lines however; each segment is transversely\r\nannulated), and bears at each end on the ventral surface a sucker, the\r\none at the posterior end being the larger. These suckers enable the\r\nleech to cling firmly to other animals. The mouth is at the front end\r\nof the body on the ventral surface and is provided with sharp jaws.\r\nLeeches live mostly on the blood of other animals which they suck from\r\nthe body. The common leech \"fastens itself upon its victim by means of\r\nits suckers, then cuts the skin, fastens its oral sucker over the\r\nwound and pumps away until it has completely gorged itself with blood,\r\ndistending enormously its elastic body, when it loosens its hold and\r\ndrops off.\" Its biting and sucking cause very little pain, and in\r\nolden days physicians used the leeches when they wanted to \"bleed\" a\r\nperson. A common European species of leech much used for this purpose\r\nis known as the \"medicinal leech.\" All leeches are hermaphroditic,\r\nthat is, the sexes are not distinct, but each individual produces both\r\nsperm-cells and egg-cells. Most of the leeches lay their eggs in small\r\npackets or cocoons. This cocoon is dropped in soil on the banks of a\r\npond or stream so that the young may have a moist but not too wet\r\nenvironment. The young issue from the eggs in four or five weeks, but\r\nthey grow very slowly and it is several years before they attain\r\ntheir full size. Leeches are long-lived animals, some being said to\r\nlive for twenty years.\r\n\r\n    =Flatworms (Platyhelminthes).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Collect some live\r\n    fresh-water planarians (see fig. 30), which are to be found on the\r\n    muddy bottom of most fresh-water ponds, and examine them while\r\n    alive in watch-glasses of water. Make drawings showing the\r\n    external appearance, and as much of the internal anatomy as can be\r\n    seen. The branching alimentary canal can be seen in more or less\r\n    detail, and with higher power of the microscope parts of the\r\n    nervous system can be seen also. Have also a tapeworm preserved in\r\n    alcohol or formalin to show the very flat and many-segmented body.\r\n\r\nThe flatworms include a large number of forms which vary much in shape\r\nand habits. They are all, however, characteristically flat; in some\r\nthis condition is very marked. Some are active free-living animals, as\r\nthe planarians (figs. 30 and 31), while many live as parasites in the\r\nalimentary canal of other animals, as do the sheep-fluke and the\r\ntapeworms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--A fresh water planarian, _Planaria_ sp. (From\r\na living specimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water planarians (fig. 30), which live commonly in the mud\r\nof the bottom of ponds, are small, being less than half an inch long.\r\nThey are very thin and rather broad, tapering from in front backwards.\r\nOn the upper surface near the front they have a pair of eyes; the\r\nmouth is on the under surface a little behind the middle of the body.\r\nThe alimentary canal is composed of three main branches, each with\r\nnumerous small side branches. One main branch runs forward from the\r\nmouth, and the other two run backwards, one on each side of the body.\r\nThere is no anal opening, and the alimentary canal thus forms a\r\nsystem of fine branches closed at the tips, and extending all through\r\nthe body. The nervous system is composed of a ganglion or brain in the\r\nfront end of the body from which two main branches extend back\r\nthroughout its whole length. From these main longitudinal branches\r\narise many fine lateral branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--A marine planarian, _Leptoplana californica_.\r\n(From a living specimen.)]\r\n\r\nOf the parasitic flatworms the tapeworms are the best known. There are\r\nnumerous species of them, all of which live in the bodies of vertebrate\r\nanimals. In the adult or fully developed stage the tapeworms live in the\r\nalimentary canal, holding on to its inner surface by hook-like clinging\r\norgans and being nourished by the already digested food by which they\r\nare bathed. In the young or larval stage tapeworms live in other parts\r\nof the body of the host, and usually, indeed, in other hosts not of the\r\nsame species as the host of the adult worm.\r\n\r\nThe common tapeworm of man, _Tænia solium_ (there are several other\r\nspecies of _Tænia_ which infest man, but _solium_ is the common one),\r\nmay serve as an example of the group. In the adult condition its body,\r\nwhich is found attached to the inner wall of the intestine, is like a\r\nlong narrow ribbon: it may be two or three metres long. It is attached\r\nby one end, the head, which is very small and provided with a score of\r\nfine hooks. Behind the head the thin ribbon-like body grows wider. The\r\nbody is composed of many (about 850) joints called proglottids. There\r\nis no mouth or alimentary canal, the liquid food being simply taken in\r\nthrough the skin. Each proglottid produces both sperm-cells and\r\negg-cells; one by one these proglottids or joints with their supply of\r\nfertilized eggs break off and pass from the alimentary canal with the\r\nexcreta. If now one of these escaped proglottids or the eggs from it\r\nare eaten by a pig, the embryos issue from the eggs in the alimentary\r\ncanal of the pig, bore through the walls of the canal and lodge in the\r\nmuscles. Here they increase greatly in size and develop into a sort of\r\nrounded sac filled with liquid. If the flesh of the pig be eaten by a\r\nman, without its being first cooked sufficiently to kill the larval\r\nsac-like tapeworms, these young tapeworms lodge in the alimentary\r\ncanal of the man and develop and grow into the long ribbon-like\r\nmany-jointed adult stage.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of the other tapeworms which infest the various\r\nvertebrate animals is of this general type. There is almost always an\r\nalternation of hosts, the larval tapeworm living in a so-called\r\nintermediate host, and the adult in a final host. Of the domestic\r\nanimals the dog is the most frequently attacked. At least ten\r\ndifferent species of tapeworms have been found in the dog. The\r\nintermediate hosts of these dog tapeworms include rabbits, sheep,\r\nmice, etc. Some of the domestic fowl, ducks, geese and chickens, for\r\ninstance, are also infested by tapeworms, and the intermediate hosts\r\nin these cases are usually insects or small aquatic crustaceans like\r\nthe familiar _Cyclops_.\r\n\r\n    =Roundworms (Nemathelminthes).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Vinegar-eels\r\n    from mouldy vinegar, and hair-worms from fresh-water pools, can\r\n    usually be readily obtained. They should be examined, and drawings\r\n    should be made of them, showing their shape and simple external\r\n    structural character. If a specimen of trichinosed pork be\r\n    obtained, the encysted stage of the _Trichina_, described in the\r\n    following account, can be shown.\r\n\r\nThe roundworms are slender, smooth, cylindrical worms pointed at both\r\nends. They are all very long in proportion to their diameter, although\r\ntheir actual length may be short. Some species are of microscopic\r\nsize; as the _Trichina_ worm, which is about 1/20 in. long; while the\r\nguinea-worm, one of the worst parasites of man, may reach a length of\r\nsix feet. Many of the roundworms are parasites living in the various\r\norgans of other animals. Some, however, lead an independent free life\r\nin water or in damp earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--A vinegar eel, _Anguillula_ sp. (From a\r\nliving specimen.)]\r\n\r\nFamiliar examples of roundworms are the so-called vinegar-eels\r\n(_Anguillula_) (fig. 32) to be found in weak vinegar, and other\r\nspecies of this same genus which live in water or moist ground or in\r\nthe tissues of plants, doing much injury. The hair-worms (_Gordius_)\r\nor horse-hair snakes, which are believed by some people, to be\r\nhorse-hairs dropped into water and turned into these animals, are also\r\nfamiliar examples of roundworms. They are often found abundantly in\r\nlittle pools after a rain, and it is sometimes said that these worms\r\ncome down with the rain. They have in reality come from the bodies of\r\ninsects in which they pass their young or larval stages as parasites.\r\nThe hair-worms all live as parasites during their larval stage, and as\r\nfree independent animals in their adult stage. Some of them require\r\ntwo distinct hosts for the completion of their larval life, living for\r\na while in the body of one, and later in the body of another. The\r\nfirst host is usually a kind of insect which is eaten by the second\r\nhost. The eggs are deposited by the free adult female in slender\r\nstrings twisted around the stems of water-plants. The young hair-worm\r\non hatching sinks to the bottom of the pond, where it moves about\r\nhunting for a host in which to take up its abode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--_Trichina spiralis_, encysted in muscle of a\r\npig. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe terrible _Trichina spiralis_ (fig. 33), which produces the disease\r\ncalled trichinosis, is another roundworm of which much is heard. This\r\nis a very small worm which in its adult condition lives in the\r\nintestine of man as well as in the pig and other mammals. The young,\r\nwhich are borne alive, burrow through the walls of the intestine, and\r\nare either carried by the blood, or force their way, all over the\r\nbody, lodging usually in muscles. Here they form for themselves little\r\ncells or cysts in which they lie. The forming of these thousands of\r\ntiny cysts injures the muscles and causes great pain, sometimes\r\ndeath, to the host. Such infested muscle or flesh is said to be\r\n\"trichinosed,\" and the flesh of a trichinosed human subject has been\r\nestimated to contain 100,000,000 encysted worms. To complete the\r\ndevelopment of the encysted and sexless _Trichinæ_ the infested flesh\r\nof the host must be eaten by another animal in which the worm can\r\nlive, e.g. the flesh of man by a pig or rat, and that of a pig by man.\r\nIn such a case the cysts are dissolved by the digestive juices, the\r\nworms escape, develop reproductive organs and produce young, which\r\nthen migrate into the muscles and induce trichinosis as before. But\r\nhowever badly trichinosed a piece of pork may be, thorough cooking of\r\nit will kill the encysted _Trichinæ_, so that it may then be eaten\r\nwith impunity. Some people, however, are accustomed to eat ham, which\r\nis simply smoked pork, without cooking it, and in such cases there is\r\nalways great danger of trichinosis.\r\n\r\n    =Wheel animalcules (Rotifera).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Live specimens of\r\n    Rotifers can be found in almost any stagnant water. Examine a drop\r\n    of such water with the compound microscope, and find in it a few\r\n    small, active, transparent creatures, larger than the _Paramœcium_\r\n    and other Protozoa in the water and which have the appearance shown\r\n    in fig. 34. They may be known by the constant whirling, or rather\r\n    vibrating, circlet or wheel of cilia at the larger or head end of\r\n    the body. These wheel animalcules may be studied alive by the class.\r\n    Although usually darting about, the animalcules occasionally cease\r\n    to move, when, because of their transparency, almost the whole of\r\n    their anatomy can be made out. Their feeding habits can also be\r\n    readily observed, and the food itself watched as it moves through\r\n    the body. Make drawings showing as much of the anatomy as can be\r\n    worked out. Note especially the \"mastax\" or gizzard-like masticating\r\n    apparatus in the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nThe wheel animalcules (fig. 34) or Rotifers look little like the other\r\nworms we have studied. But they are nevertheless more nearly related\r\nto the worms than to any other branch of animals. They are all small,\r\nabout 1/3 mm. long, and have a compact body. They are aquatic and feed\r\non smaller animals and plants or on bits of organic matter which they\r\ncapture by means of the currents produced by the vibrating cilia of\r\nthe \"wheel.\" Small as they are they have a complex body-structure,\r\nwith well-organized systems of organs. For a long time, however, they\r\nwere classed by naturalists with the Protozoa on account of their\r\nsize. They are found all over the world, mostly in fresh water; a few\r\nare marine. More than 700 species of them are known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--A wheel animalcule, _Rotifer_ sp. (From\r\nliving specimen, Stanford University.)]\r\n\r\nAn interesting thing about the Rotifers is their remarkable power to\r\nwithstand drying-up. When the water in a pond or ditch evaporates some\r\nof the Rotifers do not die, but simply dry up and lie in the dust,\r\nshrivelled and apparently lifeless, yet really in a state of suspended\r\nanimation. On being put into water they will gradually fill out to their\r\nfull size and shape, and finally resume all their normal activities. In\r\nthis dried-up condition Rotifers may persist for a long time, several\r\nyears even, although otherwise their natural life is short, being\r\nprobably of not over two weeks' duration. Certain other of the lower\r\nanimals have this same power of withstanding desiccation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[8] The author recognizes the untenability of the group Vermes as a\r\ngroup co-ordinate with the other branches of the animal kingdom, and\r\nthat \"Vermes\" has been discarded in modern text-books. But because of\r\nthe very scant consideration which can be given the various kinds of\r\nworm-like animals the course of the older text-books will be followed,\r\nand all of the worm-like animals, as far as referred to in this book,\r\nbe considered under the group name Vermes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n               BRANCH ARTHROPODA: CRUSTACEANS, CENTIPEDS,\r\n                          INSECTS, AND SPIDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great branch Arthropoda includes a host of familiar animals. It\r\ncontains more species than any other branch of the animal kingdom. To it\r\nbelong the crayfishes, shrimps, crabs, lobsters, water-fleas, and other\r\nanimals which compose the class Crustacea; the centipeds and\r\nthousand-legged worms which compose the class Myriapoda; the true or\r\nsix-footed insects forming the class Insecta, which includes nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of all the known species of animals; and the scorpions,\r\nmites, ticks, and spiders which constitute the class Arachnida. There is\r\nalso a fifth class in the branch Arthropoda which includes a few species\r\nof animals unfamiliar to us but of great interest to zoologists.\r\n\r\nAll these varied kinds of animals have a body on the annulate or\r\nsegmented type-plan, like that shown by most worms, but they differ from\r\nthe worms in possessing jointed appendages, used for locomotion or food\r\ntaking. There is typically or racially one pair of these jointed or\r\nsegmented appendages on each segment of the body, but in all of the\r\nArthropoda some of the segments have lost their appendages. The body is\r\ncovered by a firm cuticle or outer body-wall called the exoskeleton.\r\nThis exoskeleton serves not only to enclose and protect the soft parts\r\nof the body but also for the attachment of the body muscles. It may be\r\nflexible as in the sutures between the body-segments in most insects, or\r\nhard and rigid as in the sclerites of the segments. The firmness is due\r\nprimarily, and in the insects usually solely, to a deposit in the\r\ncuticle of _chitin_, a substance probably secreted by the underlying\r\ncells of the true skin, or it may be due chiefly, as in the crabs, to a\r\ncalcareous deposit. In such cases it becomes a veritable armor. The\r\ninternal organs of the Arthropods show a more or less obvious\r\nsegmentation corresponding with the segmentation of the body-wall. The\r\nalimentary canal runs longitudinally through the center of the body from\r\nmouth to anal opening. The nervous system consists of a brain lying\r\nabove the œsophagus and a double nerve-chain running backward from\r\nbeneath the œsophagus, along the median line of the ventral wall, to the\r\nposterior extremity of the body. This ventral nerve-chain consists of a\r\npair of longitudinal commissures or cords and a series of pairs of\r\nganglia, arranged segmentally. The two ganglia of each pair are fused\r\nmore or less nearly completely to form a single ganglion, and the\r\nnerve-cords are partially fused, or at least lie close together. In\r\naddition there is a smaller sympathetic system composed of a few small\r\nganglia and certain nerves running from them to the viscera, this system\r\nbeing connected with the main or central nervous system. In this group\r\nthe organs of special sense reach for the first time a high stage of\r\ndevelopment. Compound eyes are peculiar to Arthropoda. The heart lies\r\nabove the alimentary canal. Respiration is carried on by gills in the\r\naquatic forms, and by a remarkable system of air-tubes or tracheæ in the\r\nland forms (insects). The sexes are usually distinct, and reproduction\r\nis almost universally sexual. Most of the species lay eggs.\r\n\r\nThe Arthropods are animals of a high degree of organization. The\r\nextremely diverse life-habits of the various kinds among them have\r\nled to much modification and to great specialization of structure. The\r\ncourse of development, too, is made very complicated by the elaborate\r\nmetamorphosis undergone by many of the members of the branch.\r\n\r\nWe shall study the Arthropoda by getting acquainted with a few examples\r\nof each class and thus learning the special class characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n             CLASS CRUSTACEA: CRAYFISHES, CRABS, LOBSTERS,\r\n                                  ETC.\r\n\r\n                     THE CRAYFISH (_Cambarus_ sp.)\r\n\r\n=Structure.=--The structure of the crayfish has been already studied\r\n(see Chapter IV and figs. 3 and 4).\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--Crayfish frequent fresh-water lakes, rivers,\r\nand springs in most parts of the United States. Many of them perish\r\nwhenever the small prairie ponds dry up. But some burrow into the earth\r\nwhen the dry season comes. There may be noticed in meadows where water\r\nstands for certain seasons of the year many scattered holes with slight\r\nelevations of mud about them. These are mostly the burrows of crayfish.\r\nDuring the dry season the crayfish digs down until it reaches water, or\r\nat least a damp place, where it rests until wet weather brings it to the\r\nsurface once more. One of these burrows, followed in digging a mining\r\nshaft, extended vertically down to a distance of twenty-six feet, where\r\nthe crayfish was found tucked snugly away.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are carried by the female on her abdominal appendages. Previous\r\nto the laying of the eggs the female rubs off all foreign matter from\r\nthe appendages, thus preparing them for the reception of the eggs. This\r\ncleaning is done with the fifth pair of legs. When the eggs are ready\r\nto be laid, which is during the last of March or in April in the Central\r\nStates, a sticky secretion passes out of the openings at the base of the\r\nwalking legs and smears the pleopods of the abdomen. The eggs as they\r\npass out are fertilized and caught on the pleopods, where they remain\r\nattached in clusters. After some weeks the young crayfishes issue from\r\nthe eggs. In general appearance they are not very unlike the adults.\r\nThey grow very rapidly at this stage. As the animal is enclosed in a\r\nhard shell, growth can only take place during the period just following\r\nthe molt, for the crayfish casts its skin periodically, and it is while\r\nthe new shell is forming that the animal does its growing. The crayfish\r\nwhen it molts casts not only the exoskeleton, but also the lining of\r\npart of the alimentary canal. After the females have hatched their young\r\nmany die in the shallow pools, in which places the dried-up skeletons\r\nare noticeable during the summer months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           OTHER CRUSTACEANS.\r\n\r\nMost of the crustaceans live in water, a few being found in damp soil\r\nor in other moist places. Some are fresh-water animals and some\r\nmarine. They vary in size from the tiny water-fleas, a millimeter\r\nlong, to crabs two feet across the shell or sixteen feet from tip to\r\ntip of legs. They present great differences in form and general\r\nappearance of body, being adapted for various conditions of life. Some\r\ncrustaceans live as parasites on other animals, in some cases on other\r\ncrustaceans. Such parasitic species have the body much modified and\r\nare hardly to be recognized as members of the class.\r\n\r\n=Body form and structure.=--In structural character and body\r\norganization the Crustaceans show, of course, the general\r\ncharacteristics already attributed to the Arthropoda, the branch to\r\nwhich they belong. The characteristics which distinguish them from\r\nother Arthropods are the possession of gills for respiration (some\r\ninsects have gills, but of a very different kind as will be seen\r\nlater), and the bi-ramose condition of the body appendages, each\r\nappendage (excepting the antennules) consisting of a single basal\r\nsegment from which arise two branches made up of one or more segments.\r\nOf the form of the crustacean body few generalizations can be made.\r\n\r\n\"There is no [other] class in the animal kingdom which presents so\r\nwide a range of organization as the Crustacea, or in which the\r\ndeviations in structure from the 'type form' are so striking and so\r\ninteresting from their obvious adaptation to the mode of life.\" For\r\nthis reason no attempt will be made to discuss in general terms the\r\nform of the crustacean body, but brief accounts will be given of a few\r\nof the more familiar kinds of Crustacea which will serve to illustrate\r\nthis remarkable diversity of body form.\r\n\r\nSimilarly impossible is it also to give a general account of the\r\ndevelopment of the crustaceans. The sexes are distinct in most\r\nCrustacea, and there is often great difference in form between the\r\nmale and female. A certain amount of metamorphosis takes place in the\r\ndevelopment of all crustaceans; that is, the young when hatched from\r\nthe egg differs, often decidedly, in appearance and structure from the\r\nparent, and in the course of its post-embryonic development undergoes\r\nmore or less striking change or metamorphosis. This metamorphosis is\r\noften very marked.\r\n\r\n    =Water-fleas (Cyclops).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--The water-fleas are\r\n    common in the water of ponds or of slow streams; they may often be\r\n    found in the school aquarium. They are, though small (about 1 mm.\r\n    long), readily seen with the unaided eye; they are white, rather\r\n    elongate, and have a rapid jerky movement. Examine specimens alive\r\n    in water in a watch glass. Note the \"split pear\" shape, broadest\r\n    near the front, tapering posteriorly, flat beneath, convex above;\r\n    note the forked stylets at tip of abdomen; also the two pairs of\r\n    antennæ, the single median eye, the mandibles, two pairs of\r\n    maxillæ, and five pairs of legs (last pair very small). There are\r\n    no gills. Some of the specimens, females, may have attached to the\r\n    first abdominal segment on either side an egg sac. Make drawings\r\n    showing all these structural details. Watch the _Cyclops_\r\n    capturing and feeding on _Paramœcium_ or other small animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--A water-flea, _Cyclops_ sp. Female with\r\negg-masses. (From living specimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe water-fleas (_Cyclops_) (fig. 35) are among the smallest of the\r\nCrustacea. They are extremely abundant, having great power of\r\nmultiplication. \"An old _Cyclops_ may produce forty or fifty eggs at\r\nonce, and may give birth to eight or ten broods of children living\r\nfive to six months. As the young begin to reproduce at an early age,\r\nthe rate of multiplication is astonishing. The descendants of one\r\n_Cyclops_ may number in one year nearly 4,500,000,000, or more than\r\nthree times the total population of the earth, provided that all the\r\nyoung reach maturity and produce the full number of offspring.\" The\r\n_Cyclops_ feed on smaller aquatic animals such as Protozoa, Rotifera,\r\netc. They in turn serve as food for fishes; and because of their\r\nimmense numbers and occurrence in all except the swiftest fresh waters\r\n\"they form the main food of most of our fresh-water fishes while\r\nyoung.\" Many aquatic insect larvæ feed almost exclusively on them.\r\n\r\nRelated to the _Cyclops_ are a host of other kinds of minute\r\nCrustaceans. Among these the so-called fish-lice are specially\r\ninteresting because of their parasitic habits and greatly modified and\r\ndegenerate structure. There are many kinds of these parasitic\r\ncrustaceans infesting fishes, whales, molluscs, and worms. \"As on land\r\nalmost every species of bird or mammal has its own parasitic insects, so\r\nin the water almost every species of fish or larger invertebrate has its\r\nparasitic crustaceans.\" Some of the most common of these parasites\r\nattach themselves to the gills of fishes. Here they cling, sucking the\r\nblood or animal juices from the host. In form of body they do not at all\r\nresemble other Crustaceans, but are strangely misshapen. They are often\r\nworm-like, or sac-like, without legs or other locomotory appendages. As\r\nwith other parasites (see Chapter XXX) an inactive dependent life\r\nresults in the atrophy and loss by degeneration of the body-parts\r\nconcerned with locomotion and orientation.\r\n\r\n    =Wood lice (Isopoda).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Specimens of wood lice,\r\n    pill bugs, or damp bugs, as they are variously called, may be\r\n    readily found in concealed moist places, as under stones or boards\r\n    on damp soil. They are often common in houses, near drains or in\r\n    dark, damp places. Examine some live wood lice, and some dead\r\n    specimens (killed by chloroform or in an insect-killing bottle).\r\n    Note the division of the body into the head, thorax, and abdomen;\r\n    find the eyes, the antennæ and the mouthparts (mandibles and\r\n    maxillæ are usually pressed closely together). All the locomotory\r\n    appendages are adapted for walking or running, not swimming. Note\r\n    the number of pairs of legs; the structure of a leg; find gills\r\n    and gill-covers. Some females may be found with eggs on the under\r\n    side of the thorax near the bases of the legs, the eggs being\r\n    covered by thin membranous plates. Make drawings showing the\r\n    general form and character of body and details of legs, gills,\r\n    etc. Compare with the crayfish and _Cyclops_.\r\n\r\nThe wood-lice (fig. 36) are among the few Crustacea which have a\r\nwholly terrestrial life. They run about quickly and feed chiefly on\r\ndecaying vegetable matter. They are night scavengers. They have the\r\nbody oval and convex above, rather purplish or grayish brown, and\r\nsmooth. Although they do not live in the water they breathe partly at\r\nleast by means of gills (though they may breathe partly through the\r\nskin). It is therefore necessary for them to live in a damp atmosphere\r\nso that the gill membranes may be kept damp. If not kept moist they\r\ncould not serve as osmotic membranes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--A damp bug, Isopod, species not determined.\r\n(From specimen.)]\r\n\r\n    =Lobsters, Shrimps and Crabs (Decapoda).=--TECHNICAL\r\n    NOTE.--Teachers living near the sea-shore can get specimens of\r\n    live and dead lobsters, shrimps, and crabs in the markets. Schools\r\n    in the interior should have a few preserved specimens for\r\n    examination. These specimens should be compared with the crayfish;\r\n    although differences in shape of body are evident, the character\r\n    and arrangement of body parts will be found to be very similar.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most familiar Crustaceans, as the crayfishes,\r\nlobsters, shrimps, prawns and crabs, all belong to the order Decapoda,\r\nor ten-legged Crustacea. The members of this order have, including the\r\nlarge claws, ten walking feet; they all have eyes on movable stalks,\r\nand the front portion of the body is covered by a horny fold of the\r\nbody-wall called the carapace.\r\n\r\nThe lobsters are large ocean-inhabiting crustaceans which are very like\r\nthe fresh-water crayfish in all structural characters. They live on the\r\nrocky or sandy ocean-bottom at shallow depths. They feed largely on\r\ndecaying animal matter. They are caught in great numbers in so-called\r\n\"lobster pots,\" a kind of wooden trap baited with refuse. \"The number\r\nthus taken upon the shores of New England and Canada amounts to between\r\ntwenty and thirty million annually.\" Live lobsters are brownish or\r\ngreenish with bluish mottling; they turn red when boiled. A single\r\nfemale will lay several thousand eggs. The eggs are greenish and are\r\ncarried about by the mother until the young hatch. The young are\r\nfree-swimming larvæ, until they reach a length of half an inch.\r\n\r\nThe shrimps and prawns are mostly marine, though some species live in\r\nfresh water. They are, like the lobsters, used for food. Some of the\r\nspecies are gregarious in habit, occurring in great \"schools\" of\r\nindividuals. Like the lobsters they crawl about on the sea-bottom\r\nfeeding on decaying animal matter. Shrimps are very abundant near San\r\nFrancisco, where extensive \"shrimp fishing\" is done by the Chinese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Some crabs and barnacles of the Pacific\r\ncoast; the short sessile acorn barnacles in the upper left-hand corner\r\nbelong to the genus _Balanus_; the stalked barnacles in the upper\r\nright-hand corner are of the species _Pollicipes polymenus_; the\r\nlargest crab (upper left-hand) is _Brachynotus nudus_; the one in\r\nleft-hand lower corner is a young rock-crab, _Cancer productus_; the\r\ncrab in the sea-weed at the right is a kelp-crab, _Epialtus\r\nproductus_, while the two in snail-shells in lower corner are\r\nhermit-crabs, _Pagurus samuelis_. (From living specimens in a\r\ntide-pool on the Bay of Monterey, California.)]\r\n\r\nThe crabs (fig. 37) differ from the lobsters and crayfishes and\r\nshrimps in having the body short and broad, instead of elongate. This\r\nis due to the special widening of the carapace and the marked\r\nshortening of the abdomen. The abdomen, moreover, is permanently bent\r\nunderneath the body, so that but little of it is visible from the\r\ndorsal aspect. The number of abdominal legs or appendages is reduced.\r\nWhen the tide is out the rocks and tide-pools of the ocean shore are\r\nalive with crabs. They \"scuttle\" about noisily over the rocks,\r\nwithdrawing into crevices or sinking to the bottom of the pools when\r\ndisturbed. They move as readily backward or sidewise, \"crab-fashion,\"\r\nas forward. They are of various colors and markings, often so\r\npatterned as to harmonize very perfectly with the general color and\r\nappearance of the rocks and sea-weeds among which they live. The\r\nspider-crabs are especially strange-looking creatures with unusually\r\nlong and slender legs and a comparatively small body-trunk. They\r\ninclude the _Macrocheira_ of Japan, the largest of the crustaceans.\r\nSpecimens of this crab are known measuring twelve to sixteen feet from\r\ntip to tip of extended legs; the carapace is only as many inches in\r\nwidth or length. The soft-shelled crab is a species common along our\r\nAtlantic coast. It is \"soft-shelled\" only at the time of molting, and\r\nhas to be caught in the few days intervening between the shedding of\r\nthe old hard shell and the hardening of the new body-wall. The little\r\noyster-crabs (_Pinnotheres_) which live with the live oyster in the\r\ncavity enclosed by the oyster shell are well-known and interesting\r\ncrabs. They are not parasites preying on the body of the oyster, but\r\nare simply messmates feeding on particles of food brought into the\r\nshell by the currents of water created by the oysters.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting crabs are the hermit crabs (fig. 37),\r\nfamiliar to all who know the seashore. There are numerous species of\r\nthese crabs, all of which have the habit of carrying about with them, as\r\na protective covering into which to withdraw, the spiral shell of some\r\ngastropod mollusc. The abdomen of the crab remains always in the cavity\r\nof the shell; the head and thorax and legs project from the opening of\r\nthe shell, to be withdrawn into it when the animal is alarmed or at\r\nrest. The abdomen being always in the shell and thus protected loses the\r\nhard body-wall, and is soft, often curiously shaped and twisted to\r\ncorrespond to the cavity of the shell. It has on it no legs or\r\nappendages except a pair for the hindmost segment which are modified\r\ninto hooks for holding fast to the interior of the shell. As the hermit\r\ncrab grows it takes up its abode in larger and larger shells, sometimes\r\nkilling and removing piece-meal the original inhabitant. Some hermit\r\ncrabs always have attached to the shell certain kinds of sea-anemones.\r\nIt is believed that both crab and sea-anemone derive advantage from this\r\narrangement. The sea-anemone, which otherwise cannot move, is carried\r\nfrom place to place by the crab and so may get a larger supply of food,\r\nwhile the crab is protected from its enemies, the predaceous fishes, by\r\nthe stinging threads of the sea-anemone, and also perhaps by the\r\nconcealment of the shell its presence affords. This living together by\r\ntwo kinds of animals to their mutual advantage is called commensalism or\r\nsymbiosis (see Chapter XXX). The hermit crabs are not true crabs, but\r\nare more nearly related to the crayfishes and shrimps than to the true\r\nbroad-bodied, short-tailed crabs.\r\n\r\n    =Barnacles.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Specimens of barnacles may be got\r\n    readily from the tide rocks or from piles in a harbor. Interior\r\n    schools should have, if possible, specimens preserved in alcohol or\r\n    formalin for examination. The \"shells\" of acorn (sessile) barnacles\r\n    may often be found on oyster shells (get at restaurants).\r\n\r\nCrustaceans which at first glance are hardly recognizable as such are\r\nthe stalked or sessile barnacles (fig. 37) which live fixed in great\r\nnumbers on the rocks between the tide lines, or on the piles\r\nsupporting wharves, or on the bottom of ships or even on the body-wall\r\nof whales and other ocean animals. In the stalked forms the stalk is a\r\nflexible stem or peduncle covered with a blackish finely-wrinkled skin\r\nbearing at its free end the greatly modified body of the barnacle.\r\nThis body is enclosed in a sort of bivalved shell or carapace formed\r\nby a fold of the skin and stiffened by five calcareous plates. Within\r\nthis curious shell is the compact, rather worm-like body-mass, showing\r\nlittle or no indication of segmentation. The legs, of which there are\r\nusually six pairs, are much modified, being long, feathery, and\r\ndivided nearly to the base. These feathery feet project from the\r\nopened shell when the animal is undisturbed, and waving about in the\r\nwater catch small animals which serve as the barnacle's food. When\r\ndisturbed the barnacle withdraws its feet and closes tightly its\r\nstrong protecting shell. The acorn-barnacles have no stalk, but look\r\nlike a low bluntly-pointed pyramid, this appearance being due to the\r\nconverging arrangement of six calcareous plates in its body-wall.\r\n\r\nThe barnacles present several unusual conditions with regard to the\r\ninternal organs. They have no heart nor any blood-vessels; most of the\r\nspecies are hermaphroditic; and there are other indications of a\r\ndegenerate condition. This degeneration of the barnacles is due to\r\ntheir fixed life, the results of which are like those of a parasitic\r\nlife. The young barnacles when hatched from the egg are free-swimming\r\nlarvæ as with the other Crustacea. They finally attach themselves and\r\nundergo the changes, some of them of degenerative nature, which\r\nproduce the body-structure of the adult. It was long a belief among\r\nmany people that the barnacle produced the barnacle goose. Pictures in\r\nancient books show the young barnacle geese issuing from the opened\r\nshell of the barnacle. The early naturalists believed barnacles, on\r\naccount of the shell, to be a kind of shell-fish or mollusc, but when\r\ntheir development was thoroughly worked out, it became evident that\r\nthey belong to the Crustacea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n            BRANCH ARTHROPODA (_continued_); CLASS INSECTA:\r\n                              THE INSECTS\r\n\r\n                     THE LOCUST (_Melanoplus_ sp.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Locusts or grasshoppers are common and familiar\r\n    insects all over the country. The genus _Melanoplus_ includes\r\n    numerous species, one or more of which are to be found in almost any\r\n    locality. The common red-legged locust (_M. femur-rubrum_) of the\r\n    East, the Rocky Mountain migratory locust (_M. spretus_), of the\r\n    West, the large differential (_M. differentialis_) and two-striped\r\n    (_M. bivittatus_) locusts of the Southwest, are especially common\r\n    species. All the members of the genus have their hind wings\r\n    uncolored, and the front wings marked with a longitudinal series of\r\n    small dots more or less distinct, or with a longitudinal line. There\r\n    is a small blunt spine or process projecting from the ventral aspect\r\n    of the prothorax. If a species of _Melanoplus_ cannot be found, any\r\n    other locust may be used, although there are some slight variations\r\n    in the external structure of the various species. Fresh specimens\r\n    killed in a cyanide bottle (for preparing see p. 463) are preferable\r\n    in the study of the external structure, but specimens preserved in\r\n    alcohol will do.\r\n\r\n=External structure= (fig. 38).--Note that the body of the grass-hopper\r\nis composed of successive rings or _segments_ grouped into three\r\nregions, the _head_ (anterior), _thorax_ (median), and _abdomen_\r\n(posterior). In which region of the body are the segments most readily\r\ndistinguished? Of how many segments does the head appear to be composed?\r\nThe thorax is composed of three segments of which the most anterior, to\r\nwhich is attached the front pair of legs, differs from the succeeding\r\ntwo, being freely movable and bearing a large hood- or saddle-shaped\r\npiece on its dorsal aspect. To the other two thoracic segments the\r\nsecond and third pair of legs are attached, as are also the two pairs\r\nof wings. The remaining segments of the body compose the abdomen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--The red-legged locust, _Melanoplus\r\nfemur-rubrum_, to show external structure.]\r\n\r\nNote the smooth, rather firm and horny character of the body. This is\r\ndue to the fact that the skin is everywhere covered with a cuticle in\r\nwhich is deposited a horny substance called _chitin_. The cuticle is not\r\nuniformly firm over the body. At the junction of the body segments in\r\nthe abdomen, in the neck and between the segments of the legs, in fact,\r\nwherever motion is desirable, the cuticle is flexible, thus making\r\nbending of the body-wall possible. Elsewhere, however, it is hard and\r\nstiff, serving not only as a protective coat or armor over the body, but\r\nalso affording firm places for the attachment of muscles.\r\n\r\nInsects (and all other Arthropods) have no[9] internal skeleton, but,\r\nin this firm cuticle, an _exoskeleton_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the head is apparently a single segment, it is really\r\ncomposed of six or seven body segments greatly modified and firmly\r\nfused together. Note that it bears a pair of large _compound eyes_ and\r\nthree much smaller _simple eyes_ or _ocelli_.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Strip off a bit of the outer covering of a compound\r\n    eye, mount on a glass slide and examine under the microscope.\r\n\r\nNote that, as in the crayfish, each compound eye is composed\r\nexternally of many small hexagonal _facets_, the outer covering, the\r\n_cornea_, being simply the cuticular covering of the body, in this\r\nplace transparent and divided into small facets. Besides the eyes, the\r\nhead bears also several movable appendages, namely the _antennæ_, and\r\nthe _mouth-parts_. Note the number, place of insertion, and segmented\r\ncharacter of the antennæ. These antennæ are sense-organs and are used\r\nfor feeling, smelling, and, in some insects, for hearing. Note that\r\nthe mouth-parts consist of an upper, broad, flap-like piece,\r\nthe[10]_labrum_; of a pair of brown, strongly chitinized, toothed jaws\r\nor _mandibles_; of a second pair of jaw-like structures, the\r\n_maxillæ_, each of which is composed of several parts; and of an\r\nunder, freely-movable flap, the _labium_, also composed of several\r\npieces. Each maxilla bears a slender feeler or _palpus_ composed of\r\nfive segments. The labium bears a pair of similar palpi, which are,\r\nhowever, only three-segmented. The mandibles and maxillæ, which are\r\nthe insect jaws, move laterally, not vertically as with most animals.\r\n\r\nMake drawings of the lateral aspect of the head; of a bit of the\r\ncornea; of the dissected out mouth-parts.\r\n\r\nOf the three segments of the thoracic region of the body, the most\r\nanterior one is called the _prothorax_. It is freely movable and has a\r\nlarge hood or saddle-shaped piece, the _pronotum_, on its dorsal\r\naspect, and a blunt-pointed tubercle on the ventral aspect. The\r\nforemost pair of legs is attached to the prothorax. The next segment\r\nis the _mesothorax_, which is immovably fused to the next thoracic\r\nsegment. What appendages does it bear? The third segment is the\r\n_metathorax_, which besides being fused with the mesothorax in front,\r\nis similarly fused with the foremost abdominal segment behind. What\r\nappendages does the metathorax bear?\r\n\r\nExamine one of the fore legs and note that it is composed of a series\r\nof unequal parts or segments. The segment nearest the body is\r\nsub-globular and is called the _coxa_; the second segment is smaller\r\nthan the coxa and is called the _trochanter_; the third, known as the\r\n_femur_, is the largest of all; the fourth, _tibia_, is long and\r\nslender; and the next three, the last of which is the terminal one and\r\nbears a pair of claws and between them a little pad, the _pulvillus_,\r\nare called the _tarsal segments_. Most insects have five tarsal\r\nsegments. Note the great size of the hindmost or leaping legs.\r\nDetermine the segments of the middle and hindmost legs. Make a drawing\r\nof a fore leg.\r\n\r\nExamine the wings. In what ways do the front wings differ from the\r\nhind wings? The front wings are known as the wing covers or _tegmina_.\r\nNote how the hind wings fold up like a fan, and are covered and\r\nprotected by the wing covers. Draw the wings.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen is composed of a number of segments most of which resemble\r\neach other. The first segment (immediately behind the metathorax) has\r\nits dorsal and ventral parts widely separated by the cavities for the\r\ninsertion of the hindmost legs. The ventral part of this segment is\r\ndovetailed into the ventral part of the metathorax and appears to be\r\npart of it. In the dorsal part of this segment there is on each side a\r\nspot where the cuticle is only a thin membrane. At these places are\r\nthe auditory organs or ears of the locust. The thin membranes are the\r\n_tympana_. Only the various kinds of locusts and those insects closely\r\nrelated to them have ears of this kind. Most other insects are\r\nbelieved to have the sense of hearing situated in the antennæ.\r\n\r\nThe abdominal segments from second to eighth are ring-like in form and\r\nare without appendages. There is on the side of each of these segments\r\nnear its front margin a tiny opening or pore called a _spiracle_.\r\nThese spiracles are the breathing pores of the locust, which does not\r\ntake in air through its mouth or any other opening in the head. There\r\nis a spiracle near each ear in the first abdominal segment, and one on\r\neach side of the mesothorax near the insertion of the middle legs.\r\n\r\nThe terminal segments of the abdomen are provided with certain processes\r\nwhich are different in male and female. The female has at the tip of its\r\nabdomen two pairs of strong, curved pointed pieces which compose the\r\n_ovipositor_, or egg-laying organ. The opening of the oviduct lies\r\nbetween the pieces. The male has a swollen rounded abdominal tip, with\r\nthree short inconspicuous pieces on the dorsal surface.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the lateral aspect of the abdomen of a female\r\nlocust; also, of a male.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed account of the external anatomy of a locust see\r\nComstock and Kellogg's \"Elements of Insect Anatomy,\" chap. II.\r\n\r\nThe external structure of the grasshopper should be carefully compared\r\nwith that of the crayfish; pay special attention to the mouth-parts\r\nand legs.\r\n\r\nThe teacher should point out the homologies and modifications.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The eggs of the locust are laid in the\r\nautumn in the ground in bare dry places, as roadsides, closely-grazed\r\npastures, etc. The female thrusts her strong ovipositor into the soil,\r\nand by opening and shutting it, thus boring, pushes in the abdomen for\r\nabout two thirds its length. The eggs, about one hundred, are then\r\ndeposited in a capsule or pod. The young locusts hatch in the\r\nfollowing spring. When just hatched they resemble the parent locust in\r\ngeneral appearance and structure except that they lack wings, and are\r\nof course very small. The young locusts are gregarious, congregating\r\nin warm and sunny places. They feed on green plants and travel about\r\nby walking and hopping. At night they try to find shelter under\r\nrubbish in the fields. They feed voraciously and grow rapidly,\r\nreaching maturity in about two months. During this post-embryonic\r\ndevelopment and growth they molt (shed the chitinous exoskeleton) five\r\ntimes. After the first molt indications of the wings appear in the\r\nshape of small backward and downward prolongations of the posterior\r\nmargins of the dorsum of the mesothorax and metathorax. With each\r\nsucceeding molt these wing-pads, or developing wings, are larger and\r\nmore wing-like, until after the last molting they appear fully\r\ndeveloped. With each molting, too, there is a marked increase in size\r\nof the locust, the average length of the body just before the first\r\nmoult being 4.3 mm., before the second 6.8 mm., before the third 9\r\nmm., before the fourth 14 mm., before the fifth 17 mm., and after the\r\nfifth (the full-grown stage) about 26 mm.\r\n\r\nThe molting is an interesting process, and can be readily observed.\r\nThe young locust ready for its last molt crawls up some post, weed,\r\ngrass stalk, or other object, and clutches this object securely with\r\nthe hind feet. The head is generally downward. The locust remains\r\nmotionless in this position for several hours, when the skin suddenly\r\nsplits along the back from the middle of the head to the base of the\r\nabdomen. By steady swelling and contracting and slight wriggling,\r\nlasting for half an hour to three-fourths of an hour, the old skin is\r\ncompletely shed, and the wings spread out. In an hour the wings are\r\ndry and the new chitinized exoskeleton firm enough for flying, or\r\ncrawling about, and in another hour the locust begins to eat.\r\n\r\nThe red-legged locust does considerable damage to cultivated crops,\r\nbut its injuries are insignificant compared with the tremendous losses\r\noccasioned by a near relative, the Rocky Mountain Locust (_Melanoplus\r\nspretus_). This locust has its breeding-grounds on the high plateaus\r\nof the Rocky Mountain region, but it sometimes migrates in countless\r\nnumbers southeast over the plains and into the great grain-fields of\r\nthe Mississippi valley. Such migrations occurred in 1866, 1867, 1874\r\n(in this year eighteen hundred and forty two families in Kansas were\r\nreduced to destitution by the utter wiping out of their crops by the\r\nlocusts) and 1876. With the settling-up of the regions in which the\r\nRocky Mountain locust breeds, there seems to have come a change of\r\nconditions, so that no great migrations have occurred since 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE GREAT WATER-SCAVENGER BEETLE (_Hydrophilus_ sp.)\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The great water-scavenger beetles are large,\r\n    black, elliptical insects common in quiet pools where they may be\r\n    found swimming through the water, or crawling among the plants\r\n    growing on the bottom. They are an inch and a half long and are\r\n    readily distinguishable from all other water insects except the\r\n    predaceous diving beetles (_Dyticus_). The antennæ of\r\n    _Hydrophilus_, however, are thickened (clavate) at the tip, while\r\n    those of _Dyticus_ are thread-like for their whole length. The\r\n    beetles may be readily collected with a water-net, and kept alive\r\n    in glass jars or aquaria in water containing decaying vegetation.\r\n\r\n=External structure= (fig. 39).--Is the body of the water-beetle\r\ncomposed of segments? Can you make out three body-regions, _head_,\r\n_thorax_ and _abdomen_? As in the locust the _metathorax_ is fused\r\nwith the first abdominal segment and with the _mesothorax_, while\r\nthe _prothorax_ is freely movable, and is covered above by a strong\r\nshield. The chitin armor of the whole body is specially heavy and\r\nstrong, affording a great protection to the insect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Ventral aspect of male great water-scavenger\r\nbeetle, _Hydrophilus_ sp.]\r\n\r\nOn the flattened head note the _compound eyes_ and the peculiarly-shaped\r\nnine-segmented _antennæ_. Are there any _ocelli_? Dissect out the\r\nmouth-parts. The beetle's mouth is fitted for biting, the mouth-parts\r\nbeing in general character like those of the locust, with distinct\r\nflap-like _labrum_, dentate _mandibles_, jaw-like _maxillæ_ with long,\r\nslender, four-segmented _palpi_ and lip-like _labium_ with\r\nthree-segmented _palpi_. Make drawings of the antennæ and mouth-parts.\r\n\r\nNote the character of the thoracic segments. Examine the wings and\r\nlegs. The fore wings are modified into strong horny sheaths, or\r\n_elytra_, which completely cover and protect the folded hind wings.\r\nThe hind wings are large and membranous. How are they folded? Note the\r\nadaptation of the middle and hind legs for swimming. Determine the\r\nvarious segments of the legs, i.e. _coxa_, _trochanter_, _femur_,\r\n_tibia and tarsus_. Note the long longitudinal median keel on the\r\nventral aspect of the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen articulates with the metathorax by the full width of the\r\nbroad first abdominal segment. It is composed of a series of segments\r\nwithout appendages, of about equal length but decreasing in width from\r\nin front backwards. Of how many segments does the abdomen seem to be\r\ncomposed when viewed from the ventral aspect? From the dorsal?\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the ventral aspect of the whole body.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--After examining the abdomen thus far, remove it\r\n    from the rest of the body, and boil it in dilute potassium hydrate\r\n    (KOH) in a test-tube. This will soften and partially bleach the\r\n    body wall.\r\n\r\nExamine the softened specimen, and note that at least two additional\r\nsegments are to be found retracted or telescoped into the apparently\r\nlast segment. The character of these terminal abdominal segments differs\r\nin male and female individuals, and specimens of both sexes should be\r\nexamined. (The males can be distinguished from the females by the\r\npeculiar pad-like expansion of the last tarsal segment of the fore\r\nlegs.) Pull out the retracted segments, and note that they are unevenly\r\nchitinized, parts of their surface being simply membranous. Projecting\r\nbackwards are several long-pointed processes. The female has but one\r\nretracted segment. Though the females of many insects possess more or\r\nless elaborately developed egg-laying organs, this is not the case with\r\nthe beetles. Look for _spiracles_ near the lateral margins of the dorsal\r\nsurface of the abdomen. How many pairs are present?\r\n\r\n    =Internal structure= (fig. 40).--TECHNICAL NOTE.--If fresh\r\n    specimens are to be had, kill by dropping into the cyanide bottle\r\n    (see p. 463). Specimens preserved in a 5% solution of chloral\r\n    hydrate may be used if necessary. When putting specimens into this\r\n    solution a small slit should be cut through the body wall to allow\r\n    the preservative to enter the body cavity. When ready to dissect a\r\n    specimen cut off the elytra and wings close to the base, and\r\n    carefully remove all of the dorsal wall of the abdomen and thorax\r\n    and the median portion of the dorsal wall of the head. Pin out,\r\n    ventral side down, under water in a dissecting-dish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Dissection of female great water-scavenger\r\nbeetle, _Hydrophilus_ sp., the heart and tracheæ being cut away.]\r\n\r\nNote in the median dorsal line of the abdomen a pale transparent\r\nlongitudinal vessel, the _heart_ or _dorsal vessel_. Note on each side\r\nof it six prominent triangles or \"Vs\" with apex of each directed\r\nlaterally, the posterior three smaller than the anterior three of each\r\nside. These triangles are formed by respiratory tubes or _tracheæ_.\r\nFrom each spiracle or breathing-pore there extends into the body a\r\nrespiratory tube or trachea. These lateral tracheæ join a main\r\nlongitudinal trachea on each side, from which are given off branches,\r\nwhich in turn repeatedly subdivide, until all parts of the body are\r\nramified by tracheæ, large and small, bringing air to all the tissues.\r\nThe oxygen is taken up from this air, and carbonic-acid gas is given\r\nup to it, when it passes out of the body again through the spiracles.\r\nThus in the insects oxygen and carbonic-acid gas are not carried by\r\nthe blood but by special air-tubes. The respiratory system of insects\r\nis very different from that of other animals.\r\n\r\nMount a bit of trachea in glycerine on a glass slide and examine under\r\nthe microscope. Note the fine spiral line (looking like transverse\r\nannular striations) which is a thickening of the chitinous inner wall\r\nof the tube and which by its elasticity keeps the tracheal tubes open.\r\n\r\nThe heart, already noted, is composed of a longitudinal series of very\r\nthin-walled chambers, each with a pair of lateral openings into the\r\nbody-cavity and with terminal openings into the adjacent chambers. The\r\nblood, which is colorless or greenish or yellowish, is sent forward\r\nthrough the successive heart chambers by regular contractions until it\r\nfinally pours from the most anterior chamber freely into the\r\nbody-cavity. Here it bathes the body-tissues, flowing perhaps in\r\nregular paths, giving up food to the tissues and taking up food from\r\nthe alimentary canal, until it finds its way through the lateral\r\nopenings into the heart chamber again. There are no arteries or veins.\r\n\r\nNote the large mass of _muscles_ in the metathorax. Note, by attempting\r\nto remove it, that the anterior part of the muscle mass is attached to a\r\nchitinous partition-wall between the meso- and meta-thorax. Remove this\r\npartition-wall (and one between the metathorax and abdomen) and note\r\nthat certain muscles run deeply down into the body. By pulling on the\r\nbits of chitin to which the muscles are attached, the muscles (if they\r\nhave not been cut) can be stretched to the length of three-quarters of\r\nan inch. When released they will contract. (This stretching and\r\ncontracting takes place only in fresh specimens.) What are these large\r\nand numerous muscles of the thorax for?\r\n\r\nRemove the thin membrane stretching over the abdomen and in which the\r\nheart and tracheal \"Vs\" lie, and note immediately underneath it the\r\nlarge coiled _intestine_ with a knot of greenish yellow threads in the\r\ncentre. Carefully uncoil and pin out the intestine, cutting away the\r\ntying tracheæ, but being careful not to cut other structures. Work out\r\nthe full length of the alimentary canal, noting the _œsophagus_, the\r\nwidened _crop_ behind it, and the long intestine. From the intestine\r\narise several greenish yellow threads, the _Malpighian tubules_. These\r\nare the excretory organs of the insect. What is the total length of\r\nthe alimentary canal?\r\n\r\nThe reproductive organs, consisting of a pair of glands (egg-glands or\r\nsperm-glands) with a pair of tubes which unite before reaching the\r\nbody-wall and have a common external opening, may now be seen. These\r\nshould be removed, thus exposing the _ventral nerve-chain_ in the\r\nabdomen. To expose the chain in the thorax it will be necessary to pick\r\naway carefully the muscles. As in the crayfish, the central nervous\r\nsystem in the beetle consists of a ventral nerve-chain, a _brain_ or\r\n_supra-œsophageal ganglion_ and a pair of _circum-œsophageal\r\ncommissures_ connecting the brain and the foremost ganglion\r\n(_infra-œsophageal_) in the ventral chain. There are, in the ventral\r\nchain, four ganglia in the thorax and four in the abdomen. The large\r\nnerves running from the brain to the compound eyes and to the antennæ\r\ncan be traced.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing showing the nervous system.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The eggs, usually about one hundred, are\r\ndeposited in a silken sac or case which is spun by the female, and\r\neither floats freely or is attached to the under sides of the leaves\r\nof aquatic plants. This egg-case is not wholly filled with eggs but\r\nhas a considerable air-chamber in it, causing it to float. It is oval\r\nin shape, and has a peculiar curved horn-like projection at the upper\r\nend. In sixteen or eighteen days the young water-scavenger beetles\r\nhatch as elongate, wingless, active larvæ, provided with three pairs\r\nof legs and strong jaws. They remain for a short time after hatching\r\nin the egg-case, feeding on each other! After they issue from the case\r\nthey feed on flies or other insects which fall into the water, and on\r\nsnails. They breathe through a pair of spiracles situated at the\r\nposterior tip of the abdomen, coming to the surface and thrusting this\r\ntip up so that the spiracles are out of water. They grow rapidly,\r\nmolting three times before becoming full grown. They attain a length\r\nof nearly three inches. When full grown they leave the water, crawling\r\nout on the damp shore of the pond or stream, and burrow into the soil\r\nfor a few inches. Here they molt again, or pupate as it is called,\r\nchanging to a non-feeding, quiescent stage called the pupal stage. The\r\npupa is the stage in which the great changes from wingless, crawling\r\nand swimming, short-legged, long, slender-bodied larva to winged,\r\nswimming and flying, long-legged, compact, broad-bodied adult are\r\ncompleted. Late in the summer or in the fall the pupal skin breaks and\r\nthe adult issues. It works its way to the surface of the ground, and\r\nbetakes itself to the nearest water.\r\n\r\nThe water-scavenger beetle shows in its post-embryonal development a\r\n\"complete metamorphosis\" as contrasted with the \"incomplete\r\nmetamorphosis\" of the locust. Wherever among insects similar changes\r\noccur, the young issuing from eggs as larvæ only remotely resembling\r\nthe parent, and these active feeding larvæ changing finally into more\r\nor less quiescent, strictly non-feeding pupæ, which finally change\r\ninto the active adults, a complete metamorphosis is said to exist. All\r\nthe beetles, the butterflies and moths, the two-winged flies, the\r\nants, bees and wasps, and certain other groups of insects undergo in\r\ntheir post-embryonic development a complete metamorphosis. The\r\ncrickets, katydids, the sucking bugs, the May-flies, the white ants\r\nand numerous other insects have, like the locust, an incomplete\r\nmetamorphosis, that is, the young when hatched resemble in most\r\nrespects, except in the absence of wings, their parents.\r\n\r\nThe adult water-scavenger beetle feeds chiefly on decaying vegetation\r\nin the water, but instances of the taking of other insects and of\r\nsnails have been noted. Although an aquatic insect the beetle, like\r\nits larva, has no gills for breathing the air which is mixed with the\r\nwater, but has to come to the surface occasionally to obtain air. This\r\nit does in an interesting way, which should be carefully observed by\r\nthe pupils. The air is received and held by a covering of fine hairs\r\non the ventral surface of the body, so that a considerable supply may\r\nbe carried about by the beetle while underneath the surface. The\r\nbeetles often leave the water by night, flying abroad to other ponds\r\nor streams. In winter the beetles hibernate, burying themselves in the\r\nbanks of the ponds which they inhabit.\r\n\r\nFor a good account, with illustrations, of the water-scavenger\r\nbeetle's life-history see Miall's \"Natural History of Aquatic\r\nInsects,\" pp. 61-87.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE MONARCH BUTTERFLY (_Anosia plexippus_)\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The Monarch or Milkweed butterfly is distributed\r\n    all over the country. It is large, and red-brown in color, and\r\n    lays its eggs on milk weeds where the greenish yellow and\r\n    black-banded larvæ (caterpillars) may be found feeding. The\r\n    covering of scales conceals the outlines of the various external\r\n    parts, but these scales may be easily removed with dissecting\r\n    needle and a small brush. In brushing the scales from the head\r\n    care must be taken not to break off the mouth-parts.\r\n\r\n=External structure= (fig. 41).--Note the three body-regions, _head_,\r\n_thorax_ and _abdomen_. Is the body segmented? Note the dark color and\r\nfirm character of the chitinized cuticle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Body of the monarch butterfly, _Anosia\r\nplexippus_, with scales removed to show the external parts.]\r\n\r\nNote on the head the large _compound eyes_. Note the tumid convex\r\n_clypeus_ which composes most of the anterior aspect of the head. Are\r\n_ocelli_ present? Compare the _antennæ_ with those of the locust and\r\nwater-beetle. Compare also the _mouth-parts_ and note that they differ\r\nradically from those of the locust and beetle. They are not fitted for\r\nbiting, but for sucking up liquid food (the nectar of flowers). Note\r\nthe absence of a movable flap-like _labrum_ (a minute narrow stiff\r\npiece, bearing at each latera end a small group of fine brown hairs,\r\nrepresents the labrum), the entire absence of _mandibles_, and the\r\nabsence of a movable flap-like labium. The _labium_ is a fixed\r\nchitinized triangular piece forming part of the floor of the head.\r\nNote the long slender _proboscis_ coiled up like a watch-spring. (In\r\nfresh specimens this proboscis can be uncoiled and will be found\r\nflexible. If dried or alcoholic specimens are being studied, the head\r\nof the butterfly should be removed and softened in warm water before\r\nthe mouth-parts are examined.) On either side of this proboscis is a\r\npeculiar pointed process which rises from the under side of the head.\r\nThese processes are the _labial palpi_ and serve to protect the\r\nsucking proboscis. The proboscis itself is composed of the two greatly\r\nmodified _maxillæ_. Instead of being short, jaw-like and composed of\r\nseveral pieces as in the locust, in the butterfly each maxilla is a\r\nslender, flexible half tube applied against its mate on the opposite\r\nside in such a way as to form a perfect tube long enough to reach into\r\nthe nectaries of flowers when in use and capable of being compactly\r\ncoiled up at other times. Cut across the proboscis and note the canal\r\nin the centre. Try to separate the two maxillæ which compose it.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the frontal aspect of the head with the eyes and\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\nCompare the thorax with that of the beetle and that of the locust. The\r\n_prothorax_ is a freely movable narrow ring or collar. The _mesothorax_\r\nand _metathorax_ are fused to form a large convex mass, of which fully\r\nfive-sixths is mesothorax and only one-sixth metathorax. Try to\r\ndistinguish the boundaries of the two segments. Note the three pairs of\r\nlegs; the differences in size among them, and the differences between\r\nthem and the legs of the locust and water-beetle. In one of the legs\r\ndetermine the _coxa_, _trochanter_, _femur_, _tibia_ and _tarsal\r\nsegments_. Note the differences between the wings of the butterfly and\r\nthose of the locust and beetle. Note that the wings are membranous, but\r\nare covered with many fine _scales_ (fig. 42), as is, indeed, the whole\r\nbody. Rub off some of these scales on a glass slide and examine; note\r\nshape, little stem or pedicel of insertion, and longitudinal striations.\r\nExamine under microscope a bit of wing from which some of the scales\r\nhave been rubbed. How are the scales attached to the wing membranes?\r\nHow are the scales arranged? Note that the wing is colorless where the\r\nscales have been removed. All the colors and patterns of the wings of\r\nbutterflies are produced by the scales.\r\n\r\nMake drawings of scales; of parts of denuded wings, and of bit of wing\r\ncovered with scales.\r\n\r\nRemove all or nearly all the scales from a wing and note the\r\narrangement of the _veins_ (_venation_). Compare with venation in\r\nwings of locust.\r\n\r\nMake drawing showing venation in the butterfly's wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Bit of wing of Monarch butterfly, _Anosia\r\nplexippus_, magnified to show the scales; some scales removed to show\r\nthe insertion-pits and their regular arrangement. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe venation of insects' wings is much used in insect classification,\r\nand the various veins have been given names. The names of the veins in\r\nthe butterfly's wings are given in fig. 43. When the veins in the wings\r\nof all the various groups of insects are studied, it is evident that the\r\nprincipal ones are the same in all insects, so that the costa,\r\nsub-costa, radius, media, cubitus and anal veins of the butterfly's\r\nwings can be compared with the corresponding veins in the wings of a\r\nbeetle or wasp or fly. Noting the differences in the number and\r\ncharacter of branching of these principal veins, and the number and\r\ndisposition of the cross-veins which connect the longitudinal veins, the\r\nvarious kinds of insects can be to a large extent properly grouped or\r\nclassified. A detailed account of the wing-veins of insects is given in\r\nComstock and Kellogg's \"Elements of Insect Anatomy,\" chap. VII.\r\n\r\nOf how many segments is the abdomen composed? The first or basal segment\r\nis depressed, while the others are more or less compressed. The\r\n_spiracles_ are, as in the locust, situated on the lateral aspects of\r\nthe abdominal segments. What segments bear spiracles? The terminal\r\nsegments of the abdomen differ in the two species. In the female the\r\ndorsal part of the (apparently) last segment is longer than the ventral\r\npart and is bent down over it forming a sort of hood over a space\r\nenclosed partly by this hood, partly by a bluntly-pointed projection\r\nfrom the ventral surface, and partly by the lateral margins of the\r\nsegment. In this chamber lies the opening from which the eggs issue. In\r\nthe male there are several backward-projecting, horny, thin processes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Wings of monarch butterfly, _Anosia\r\nplexippus_, to show venation; _c_, costal vein; _sc_, sub-costal vein;\r\n_r_, radial vein; _cu_, cubital vein; _a_, anal veins. In addition\r\nmost insects have a vein lying between the sub-costal and radial veins\r\ncalled the median vein.]\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the lateral aspect of the whole body.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The tiny, conical, yellowish-green eggs of\r\nthe monarch butterfly are deposited on the under side of the leaves of\r\nmilkweeds (_Asclepias_) and when examined under the microscope are\r\nseen to be very beautiful little objects finely ribbed with\r\nlongitudinal and transverse striæ. The eggs are laid in April and May\r\n(depending on the latitude and season) by females which have\r\nhibernated in the adult condition. From the eggs the minute,\r\ncylindrical, pale-green, black-headed larvæ hatch in four or five\r\ndays. As soon as hatched the larva devours the eggshell from which it\r\nhas escaped and then feeds voraciously on the milkweed leaves. It\r\ngrows rapidly, and in three or four days a blackish band or ring\r\nappears on each segment, and for the rest of its life it is very\r\nconspicuously colored with its black rings on a yellowish-green\r\nbackground. It molts three times, and in from twelve to twenty days is\r\nready to pupate, or change to a chrysalis.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to pupate the larva usually leaves the milkweed plant, and\r\nseeks some such protected place as the under side of a fence-rail or\r\njutting rock. Here it attaches its posterior extremity by a small\r\nsilken web to the rail or rock, and casting its larval skin appears as\r\na beautiful pale-green chrysalis with ivory black and golden spots. It\r\nhangs motionless, and of course without taking food, for from a week\r\nto two weeks (according to season and temperature), when the pupal\r\ncuticle breaks and the great red-brown butterfly (fig. 165) issues.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly feeds (as is indicated by the structure of its\r\nmouth-parts) very differently from the larva; it sucks up by means of\r\nits long tubular proboscis the nectar of flowers, nor does it confine\r\nitself at all to the flowers of milkweeds. It is a fine flyer and a\r\ngreat traveller. Many thousands of these butterflies often make long\r\nflights or migrations together. At other times tens of thousands of\r\nthese butterflies congregate in a certain limited area, clinging\r\nsometimes to the branches of a few trees in such numbers and so\r\nclosely together as to give the tree a brown color. Such a \"sembling\"\r\nof monarch butterflies occurs every year near the Point Pinos\r\nlighthouse on the Bay of Monterey, California. The object of this\r\nassembling together is not understood. Both the larvæ and adults of\r\nthe monarch butterfly are distasteful to birds, by their possession\r\nof an acrid body-fluid. The species is thus protected against the most\r\ndangerous enemies of butterflies, a fact which chiefly accounts for\r\nthe great abundance and wide distribution of the monarch (see p. 137).\r\nFor a full account of the life-history of the monarch butterfly, see\r\n\"Scudder's Life of a Butterfly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n            LARVA OF MONARCH BUTTERFLY (_Anosia plexippus_)\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--For directions for finding and identifying the\r\n    larvæ of the monarch butterfly see p. 171. If larvæ (caterpillars)\r\n    of _Anosia_ cannot be found, those of any other butterfly or moth\r\n    will do. Use naked, smooth kinds like cutworms, cabbage worms and\r\n    the like, rather than hairy or spiny ones. Use large specimens.\r\n    Kill the caterpillar with ether or in a cyanide bottle.\r\n\r\n=Structure= (fig. 44).--As we have learned from the study of the\r\nlife-history of the locust, water-beetle and butterfly, some insects\r\nare hatched from the egg in a condition resembling that of the parents\r\nin most structural characters. This is true of the locust. Other\r\ninsects, as the beetle and butterfly, are hatched in a form and\r\ncondition apparently very different from that of the parents. The\r\nexternal appearance of a beetle or butterfly larva differs much from\r\nthat of the adult or imago of the same individual. It will be of\r\ninterest to examine more particularly the structural condition of one\r\nof these larvæ and to compare it with the structure of the adult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Dissection of the silkworm, larva of the moth\r\n_Bombyx mori_.]\r\n\r\nIs the body segmented? Is the body composed of _head_, _thorax_ and\r\n_abdomen_? Note the soft, flexible, weakly-chitinized condition of the\r\n_body-wall_. How many pairs of legs are there? Where are they\r\nsituated? Is there any difference in the various legs? If so, what is\r\nthe difference? Which of the legs of the larva correspond with the\r\nlegs of the butterfly? Why? The prothoracic segment and the abdominal\r\nsegments 1 to 8 each bear a pair of _spiracles_ (small blackish spots\r\non the sides). Are both _compound_ and _simple eyes_ present? How many\r\neyes are there? Are there _antennæ_? Dissect out the _mouth-parts_.\r\nHow do they differ from those of the butterfly? Are they more like the\r\nmouth-parts of the butterfly or more like those of the locust?\r\n\r\nWith fine sharp-pointed scissors make a shallow longitudinal incision\r\nalong the whole length of the dorsal wall. In a freshly-killed\r\nspecimen a drop of pale greenish blood will issue as the scissors'\r\npoint is first thrust through the skin. Put a droplet of this blood on\r\na glass slide, cover with cover glass and examine with high power of\r\nthe microscope. Note that the blood is a fluid containing numerous\r\nsub-circular or elliptical bodies, the _blood-corpuscles_. Note at\r\nleast two kinds of corpuscles: most abundant a granular, circular\r\nkind, the true blood-corpuscles; and rarer, a larger, clear, usually\r\nelliptical or oval, but sometimes irregular and amœbiform kind,\r\ngenerally spoken of as _fat-cells_.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the corpuscles in the field of the microscope.\r\n\r\nAfter making the dorsal longitudinal incision pin out the caterpillar in\r\nthe dissecting-dish with dorsal aspect uppermost. When the edges of the\r\nskin are pinned back, the organs most conspicuous in the body-cavity\r\nwill be the flocculent masses of _adipose tissue_, the large, simple,\r\ntubular _alimentary canal_ usually dark or greenish because of the color\r\nof its contents, and the numerous silvery _tracheal tubes_. In those\r\ncaterpillars which spin a silken cocoon, the _silk_ or _spinning-glands_\r\nare usually long and prominent. They lie on either side of the anterior\r\npart of the alimentary canal, and open by a common duct on the labium.\r\nRising from behind the middle of the alimentary canal may be found the\r\nlong, whitish, folded and twisted _Malpighian tubules_. By picking away\r\nthe fat masses, expose the full length of the alimentary canal. Note its\r\ngreat size (large diameter). Is it divided into distinct regions such\r\nas crop, proventriculus, stomach, intestine, etc.? How is it held in\r\nplace? Trace the principal longitudinal tracheal trunks. Find, if you\r\ncan, a pair of small compact bodies usually somewhat elongate, one lying\r\non each side of the posterior part of the alimentary canal. These are\r\nthe rudimentary reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nRemove the alimentary canal by cutting it off at its posterior tip and\r\nalso in the prothoracic segment. Work out now the _ventral nerve-cord_\r\nand _ganglia_, and the _supra-œsophageal_ (brain) and _infra-œsophageal\r\nganglia_ and the _commissures_ in the head.\r\n\r\nIn the body of the caterpillar we have found the same general\r\ndisposition of organs as in the body of an adult insect, but several\r\ndifferences are nevertheless noticeable, viz., the presence of a large\r\nquantity of fatty tissue, the great size and simple character of the\r\nalimentary canal, and the undeveloped condition of the reproductive\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER INSECTS\r\n\r\nThe class Insecta includes those Arthropods which have one pair of\r\nantennæ (sense appendages), three pairs of mouth-parts (oral\r\nappendages), and three pairs of legs (locomotory appendages). The\r\ninsects, in further contradistinction to the crustaceans, are mostly\r\nland animals and breathe by means of tracheæ or tracheal gills. They\r\nare the most familiar of land invertebrates, and, as already\r\nmentioned, include more species than are comprised in all the other\r\ngroups of animals taken together. Beetles, moths and butterflies,\r\nflies, wasps and bees, dragonflies and grasshoppers are familiar\r\nmembers of the class of insects, but spiders, mites, scorpions,\r\ncentipeds and thousand-legged worms are not true insects and should\r\nnot be so miscalled. These last belong to the branch Arthropoda but to\r\nother classes than the class Insecta. While insects are found living\r\nunder most diverse conditions on land, that is, on the ground, in the\r\nleaves, fruits and stems of plants, in the trunks of trees or in dead\r\nwood, in the soil, in decaying animal or plant matter, as parasites on\r\nor in other animals, and in all fresh-water ponds and streams, they do\r\nnot live in ocean water. A few species live habitually on the surface\r\nof the ocean, and a few other forms are found habitually on the\r\nwater-drenched rocks and seaweeds between tide lines. The varied\r\nhabits of insects, their economic relations with man, the beauty and\r\ngrace of many of them, and the readiness with which they may be\r\ncollected, reared and studied, renders them unusually fit animals for\r\nthe special attention of beginning students of zoology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--A wingless insect; the American spring-tail.\r\n_Lepidocyrtus americanus_, common in dwelling-houses. The short line\r\nat the right indicates the natural size. (From Marlatt.)]\r\n\r\n=Body form and structure.=--The segments composing the body of an insect\r\nare grouped to form three body-regions, the head, thorax, and abdomen.\r\nThe head of an adult insect appears to be a single segment or body-ring,\r\nbut in reality it is composed of several segments, probably seven,\r\ncompletely fused. The head bears the eyes, antennæ and the mouth-parts.\r\nThe thorax is made up of three segments, each segment bearing a pair of\r\nlegs. From the dorsal side of the hinder two thoracic segments arise\r\nthe two pairs of wings which are the most striking structural features\r\nof insects. Not all insects are winged, (fig. 45), and of those which\r\nare a few have only one pair of wings, but the great majority of them\r\nhave two pairs of well-developed wings (fig. 46), which give them, as\r\ncompared with the other animals we have studied, a new and most\r\neffective means of locomotion. The great numbers of insects and their\r\npreponderance among living animals is undoubtedly largely due to the\r\nadvantage derived from their power of flight. The hindmost part of the\r\nbody, the abdomen, is composed of from seven to eleven segments, only\r\nthe last one or two of which are ever provided with appendages. When\r\nsuch posterior abdominal appendages are present they form egg-laying or\r\nstinging or clasping organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--A four-winged insect; a stone fly, _Perla_\r\nsp., common about brooks. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nThe body-wall is usually firm and rigid, with thinner flexible places\r\nbetween the segments and body-parts for the sake of motion. The\r\nbody-wall is composed of a cellular skin or hypoderm, and an outer\r\nnon-cellular cuticle in which is deposited a horny substance called\r\nchitin. This chitinous cuticle or exoskeleton serves as an armor or\r\nprotective covering for the soft body within, and also as a point of\r\nattachment for the many muscles of the body.\r\n\r\nInsects vary a great deal in regard to shape and appearance of the body,\r\nand certain of the external organs are greatly modified in different\r\ninsects to adapt them to the varied conditions under which they live.\r\nEspecially interesting and important are the variations in the character\r\nof the mouth-parts and wings, the organs of food-getting and locomotion.\r\nIn our consideration later of some of the more important groups of\r\ninsects the modification of these parts will be specially referred to.\r\nDespite the great number of insects, however, and their varied habits of\r\nlife, a strong uniformity of body-structure is noticeable, all of them\r\nholding pretty closely to the typical body-plan.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of the internal anatomy of the insect\r\nbody is the respiratory system. Insects breathe through tiny paired\r\nopenings, called spiracles, in the sides of the abdominal (and\r\nsometimes the thoracic) segments (the number and disposition of the\r\npairs of spiracles varying much in different insects). These spiracles\r\nare the external openings of an elaborate system of air-tubes or\r\ntracheæ (fig. 47) which ramify throughout the whole body and carry air\r\nto all the organs and tissues. The blood has apparently nothing to do\r\nwith respiration as it has in the vertebrate animals, where it carries\r\noxygen to all the body tissues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Piece of trachea (air-tube) from the larva of\r\nthe giant-cranefly. (Photo-micrograph by Geo. O.

O. Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\nThe other systems of organs are well developed and in many respects\r\nmore complex and elaborate than those of any of the other\r\ninvertebrates. The muscular system comprises a large number of\r\ndistinct muscles, usually small and short, which are disposed so as to\r\nmake very effective the various complex motions of antennæ,\r\nmouth-parts, legs, wings, and egg-laying organs. The muscles appear to\r\nbe very delicate, being almost colorless when fresh, but they have a\r\nhigh contractile power. The alimentary canal is divided into various\r\nspecial regions, as pharynx, œsophagus, crop, fore stomach or gizzard,\r\ndigesting stomach, and small and large intestine. From the canal just\r\nat the point of union of the digesting stomach (ventriculus) and the\r\nsmall intestine rise the so-called Malpighian tubules, which are\r\nexcretory organs. They are long slender diverticula of the alimentary\r\ncanal, and are typically six (three pairs) in number. The circulatory\r\nsystem is composed of a tubular vessel running longitudinally through\r\nthe body in the median line just under the dorsal wall. It is composed\r\nof a series of chambers or segmental parts, which by a rhythmic\r\ncontraction and expansion propel the blood anteriorly and into a\r\nshort, narrow, unsegmented anterior portion of the vessel which may\r\nbe called the aorta. There are no other arteries or veins, the blood\r\nsimply pouring out of the anterior end of the dorsal vessel into the\r\nbody-cavity. It bathes the body tissues, flowing usually in regular\r\nchannels without walls. It re-enters the dorsal vessel through paired\r\nlateral openings in the chambers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--A section through the compound eye (in late\r\npupal stage) of the blow-fly, _Calliphora romitoria_. In the centre is\r\nthe brain, with optic lobe, and on the right-hand margin are the many\r\nommatidia in longitudinal section. (Photo-micrograph by Geo. O.\r\nMitchell.)]\r\n\r\nThe main or central nervous system consists of a large ganglion, the\r\n\"brain,\" situated in the head above the œsophagus, which sends nerves to\r\nthe antennæ and eyes, a ganglion in the head below the œsophagus\r\nconnected with the brain by a short commissure on each side of the\r\nœsophagus, and sending nerves to the mouth-parts; and a ventral\r\nnerve-chain composed of a pair of longitudinal commissures lying close\r\ntogether and running from the head to the next to the last abdominal\r\nsegment, which bears a series of segmentally disposed ganglia, each\r\nganglion being composed of two ganglia more or less nearly completely\r\nfused. There is, in addition, a lesser system called the sympathetic\r\nsystem, which comprises a few small ganglia and certain nerves which run\r\nfrom them to the viscera. The function of the nervous system of insects\r\nreaches a very high development among the so-called \"intelligent\r\ninsects\" and certain extraordinarily complex and interesting instincts\r\nare possessed by many forms. The social or communal habits of the ants,\r\nbees, and wasps and the habits connected with the deposition of the eggs\r\nand the care of the young exhibited by the digger wasps and other\r\ninsects are of extreme specialization. The organs of special sense are\r\nhighly specialized, the sense of smell (fig. 48) reaching in particular\r\na high degree of perfection. One of the compound eyes (figs. 49 and 50)\r\nmay contain as many as 30,000 distinct eye-elements or ommatidia, but\r\nthe sight is probably in no insect very sharp or clear. Among insects\r\nthere are organs of hearing of two principal kinds. In one kind the\r\norgan for taking up the sound-waves is a group of vibratile hairs\r\nusually situated on the antennæ, as is the case with the mosquito; in\r\nthe other kind, it is a stretched membrane or tympanum such as is found\r\nin the fore leg of a cricket or katydid or on the first abdominal\r\nsegment of the locust (fig. 51).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Part of cornea, showing facets, of the\r\ncompound eye of a horse-fly (_Therioplectes_ sp.). (Photo-micrograph\r\nby Geo. O. Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--The auditory organ of a locust (_Melanoplus_\r\nsp.). The large clear part in centre of the figure is the thin\r\ntympanum, with the auditory vesicle (small black pear-shaped spot) and\r\nauditory ganglion (at left of vesicle and connected with it by a\r\nnerve) on its inner surface. (Photo-micrograph by Geo. O. Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\nThe sexes are distinct in insects, and there is often a marked sex\r\ndimorphism; in numerous species the males are winged while the females\r\nare wingless, and in a few cases this condition is reversed. Where there\r\nis a difference in size between male and female, the females are usually\r\nthe larger. Fertilization of the egg takes place in the body of the\r\nfemale and, strangely, this fertilization is effected after the eggshell\r\nhas been formed. In all insect eggs there is a minute opening in one\r\npole of the eggshell called the micropyle through which the sperm-cells\r\nenter. In a few cases the young are born alive, but such a viviparous\r\ncondition is exceptional. In a few species, too, young are produced\r\nparthenogenetically, that is, are produced from unfertilized eggs. And\r\nin the case of a few insect species male individuals are not known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--The young (at left) and adult (at right) of\r\nthe bed-bug, _Acanthia lectularia_, a wingless insect with incomplete\r\nmetamorphosis. (After Riley.)]\r\n\r\n=Development and life-history.=--The young insect when just hatched\r\nfrom the egg either resembles, except for the absence of wings, its\r\nparent in general appearance as in the case of the locust, or it may,\r\nas in the butterfly, emerge in a form very unlike the parent. In the\r\nfirst case the young has simply to grow, that is, to increase in size,\r\nto develop wings, and to make some other not very obvious\r\ndevelopmental changes in order to become fully grown. But in the case\r\nof the butterfly, and similarly in the case of all other insects as\r\nthe flies, beetles, bees _et al._, whose young hatch in a larval\r\ncondition differing markedly from the adult, some radical and striking\r\ndevelopmental changes occur before maturity is reached. Such insects\r\nare said to undergo complete metamorphosis in their development, while\r\nthose insects like the locusts, the sucking-bugs, white ants, and\r\nothers, the just hatched young of which resemble their parents, are\r\nsaid to have an incomplete metamorphosis (fig. 52).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--The larva of the violet tip butterfly,\r\n_Polygonia interragationis_, making its last molt, i.e. pupating.\r\n(Photograph from life.)]\r\n\r\nIn the case of insects with complete metamorphosis, the young hatches\r\nas an active grub or worm-like feeding larva which increases in size,\r\ncasting its skin or molting several times in its growth. Finally after\r\nthe last larval molt (fig. 53) called pupation the insect appears in a\r\nquiescent non-feeding stage called the pupa (fig. 54), and encased in\r\nan extra thick and firm chitinous exoskeleton. The immovable pupa is\r\nsometimes concealed underground, sometimes enclosed in a silken cocoon\r\nspun by the larva just before pupation, or is in some other way\r\nspecially protected. It is in this pupal condition that the great\r\nchanges from wingless, often legless, worm-like larva to winged,\r\nsix-legged, graceful imago of adult stage are completed, and with the\r\nmolting of the chitinous pupal cuticle the metamorphosis or\r\ndevelopment of the insect is completed. As a matter of fact many of\r\nthe special organs of the adult, the legs and wings, for example,\r\nbegin to develop as little buds or groups of cells in the body of the\r\nlarva, and when the larva is ready to pupate these imaginal wings and\r\nlegs are drawn out to the external surface of the body, and may be\r\nreadily recognized as they lie on the ventral surface of the pupa\r\nfolded and closely pressed to the body surface. In recent years the\r\nstudy of the post-embryonic development of insects with complete\r\nmetamorphosis has revealed some remarkable changes of the internal\r\norgans which result in a nearly complete disintegration or breaking\r\ndown of most of the internal organs of the larva (fig. 55) and a\r\nrebuilding of the organs of the adult from primitive beginnings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Chrysalid (pupa) of the violet tip butterfly,\r\n_Polygonia interragationis_. From this chrysalid issues the full\r\nfledged butterfly. (Photograph from life.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--A cross-section of the body of the pupa of a\r\nhoney-bee, showing the body cavity filled with disintegrated tissues,\r\nand (at the bottom) a budding pair of legs of the adult, the larva\r\nbeing wholly legless. (Photo-micrograph by Geo. O. Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\nThe habits of the larvæ of insects with complete metamorphosis and of\r\nthe young of some insects with incomplete metamorphosis often differ\r\nmarkedly from the habits of the adults, and as the habits and\r\ninstincts of insects are remarkably specialized, the study of their\r\nbehavior and of the structural and physiological modification which\r\ntheir varied habits of life have brought about is of much interest and\r\nsignificance. In later paragraphs this phase of insect study will be\r\nagain referred to.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--Much attention has been paid to the classification of\r\ninsects and the 300,000 (approximately) known species have been\r\nvariously grouped together into orders by different entomologists. A\r\nsubdivision of the class Insecta into five orders was proposed by\r\nLinnæus about 1750 and was used until comparatively recently. Since\r\nthen, however, numerous other arrangements have been proposed, all of\r\nthem agreeing in increasing the number of orders by breaking up some of\r\nthe old ones into two or more new ones. The classification adopted in\r\nthe text-book[11] of zoology which we have made our reference in\r\nclassification is an 8-order system. The latest English[12] text-book in\r\nentomology adopts a 9-order system, while the principal American[13]\r\ntext-book on this subject divides the insects into nineteen orders.\r\n\r\nThe classification depends chiefly on the character of the\r\npost-embryonic development, that is, on whether the metamorphosis is\r\ncomplete or incomplete, and on the structural character of the\r\nmouth-parts and wings. In the following paragraphs a few of the larger\r\ninsect orders, with some special representatives of each, will be\r\nbriefly considered.\r\n\r\nThe best American text-book of the classification and habits of\r\ninsects is Comstocks' \"Manual of Insects.\" For an account of the\r\nstructure of the wings and mouth-parts of various insects see Comstock\r\nand Kellogg's \"Elements of Insect Anatomy.\"\r\n\r\n    =Orthoptera: the locusts, cockroaches, crickets, katydids,\r\n    etc.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain specimens of crickets or katydids,\r\n    and cockroaches, and compare the external body structure with that\r\n    of the grasshopper; examine especially the wings, mouth-parts,\r\n    legs, and egg-laying organs. Note that the hindmost legs of the\r\n    cockroach are not fitted for leaping but for running. Note the\r\n    sound-making (stridulating) organs on the bases of the fore wings\r\n    of the male katydids and crickets. Note the auditory organs\r\n    (tympana) in the fore tibiæ of the katydids and crickets. Crickets\r\n    can be easily kept alive in breeding-cages in the laboratory and\r\n    their feeding habits and much of their life-history observed. The\r\n    growth of the young and the development of the wings can be noted,\r\n    and will be found to be essentially similar to the conditions\r\n    already found in the case of the locust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--The house cricket, male (_a_) and female\r\n(_b_). (From Marlatt.)]\r\n\r\nThe locust studied as one of the examples of the class Insecta belongs\r\nto the order Orthoptera, which also includes the cockroaches, crickets\r\n(fig. 56), katydids and green grasshoppers, the walking-stick or twig\r\ninsects, the praying mantis and others. The members of this order all\r\nhave an incomplete metamorphosis, and in all the mouth-parts are fitted\r\nfor biting and the fore wings are more or less thickened and modified to\r\nserve as covers or protecting organs for the broad, plaited, membranous\r\nhind wings, which are the true flight organs. The hind legs of locusts,\r\ngrasshoppers, crickets, and katydids are very large, and enable the\r\ninsects to leap; the legs of the cockroaches are fitted for swift\r\nrunning; the fore legs of the praying mantis are fitted for grasping\r\nother insects which serve as their food, and the legs of the\r\nwalking-stick (fig. 162) are long and slender and fitted for slow\r\nwalking. The shrill singing of the crickets and katydids and the loud\r\n\"clacking\" of the locusts are all made by stridulation, that is, by\r\nrubbing two roughened parts of the body together. The sounds of insects\r\nare not made by vocal cords in the throat. The male crickets and\r\nkatydids (for only the males sing) have the veins of the fore wings\r\nmodified so that when the bases of the wings are rubbed together (and\r\nwhen the cricket or katydid is at rest the base of one fore wing\r\noverlaps the base of the other) a part of one wing called the \"scraper\"\r\nrubs against a part of the other called the \"file\" and the shrilling is\r\nproduced. The sounds of locusts are produced by the rubbing of the\r\ninside of the hind leg against the outside of the fore wing when the\r\ninsect is at rest, or by striking the front margin of each hind wing\r\nagainst the hind margin of each fore wing when the locust is flying. For\r\nhearing the Orthoptera are provided with auditory organs having the\r\ncharacter of tympana or vibrating membranes. In the locusts these ears\r\n(fig. 51) are situated on the dorsal surface of the first abdominal\r\nsegment; in the katydids and crickets they are in the tibiæ of the fore\r\nlegs. The food of locusts, crickets, and katydids is vegetable, being\r\nusually green leaves; the cockroaches eat either plant or animal\r\nsubstances fresh or dry, while the praying mantis is predaceous, feeding\r\non other insects which it catches in its strong grasping fore legs. The\r\nwalking-stick or twig insect is an excellent example of what is called\r\n\"protective resemblance\" among animals. Indeed most of the Orthoptera\r\nare so colored and patterned as to be almost indistinguishable when on\r\ntheir usual resting- or feeding-grounds. Some of the tropical Orthoptera\r\ncarry to a marvelous degree this modification for the sake of\r\nprotection. (In this connection read Chapter XXXI referring to\r\n\"Protective Resemblances\".)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--A bird louse, _Nirmus præstans_, from a tern,\r\n_Sterna maxima_. Most birds are infested with small, wingless, biting\r\ninsects, called bird-lice, which are external parasites feeding on the\r\nfeathers of the bird host. The bird louse figured is about 1/12 in.\r\nlong. (Photo-micrograph by Geo. O. Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\n    =Odonata and Ephemerida: the dragon-flies and\r\n    May-flies.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain specimens of adult and\r\n    immature dragon-flies. The young dragon-flies (fig. 59) may be got\r\n    by raking out some of the slime and aquatic vegetation from the\r\n    bottom of a small pond. Compare the external structure of the\r\n    adult dragonflies with that of the grasshopper; note the large\r\n    eyes, the narrow nerve-veined wings, the biting mouth-parts, and\r\n    the short antennæ. Compare the young dragon-flies with the\r\n    adults; note the developing wings and the peculiar modification of\r\n    the lower lip into a protrusible, grasping organ which when at\r\n    rest is folded like a mask over the face. Examine the interior of\r\n    the posterior part of the alimentary canal to find the rectal\r\n    gills. Obtain specimens of adult and young May-flies. The young\r\n    may be found on the under side of stones in a \"riffle\" in almost\r\n    any stream. They live also in ponds. They may be recognized by\r\n    reference to fig. 61. Compare adult May-flies with the\r\n    dragon-flies; note the weakly chitinized, delicate body-wall, and\r\n    the difference in size between fore and hind wings; note the\r\n    biting mouth-parts of the young and their absence or presence in\r\n    vestigial condition only in the adults.\r\n\r\n    The young of both dragon-flies and May-flies may easily be kept\r\n    alive in the laboratory aquarium (fruit-jars or battery-jars with\r\n    pond water in), and their feeding habits, their swimming, their\r\n    respiration, and much of their development observed. The young\r\n    May-flies should be got from ponds, not running streams. Put one\r\n    of these semi-transparent May-fly nymphs into a watch-glass of\r\n    water, and examine under the microscope. The movements of the\r\n    gills, heart, and alimentary canal, and much of the anatomy can\r\n    be readily made out. The emergence of the adult from the nymphal\r\n    skin can be seen if close watch is kept. The young dragon-flies\r\n    may be seen to capture and devour their prey. They may also\r\n    transform into adults, but for this it will be necessary to\r\n    obtain nymphs nearly ready for transformation.\r\n\r\nAmong the most familiar and interesting insects are the dragon-flies\r\n(fig. 58), sometimes called \"devil's darning-needles.\" They are\r\ncommonly seen flying swiftly about over ponds or streams catching\r\nother flying insects. The dragon-flies are the insect-hawks; they are\r\npredaceous and very voracious, and are probably the most expert flyers\r\nof all insects. There are many species, and their bright iridescent\r\ncolors and striking wing-patterns make them very beautiful. The young\r\ndragon-flies (fig. 59) are aquatic, living in streams and ponds, where\r\nthey feed on the other aquatic insects in their neighborhood. They\r\ncatch their prey by lying in wait until an insect comes close enough\r\nto be reached by the extraordinarily developed protrusible grasping\r\nlower lip (fig. 60). When at rest this lower lip lies folded on the\r\nface so as to conceal the great jaws. The young dragon-flies breathe\r\nby means of gills which do not project from the outside of the body,\r\nas do the gills of other aquatic insects, but line the inner wall of\r\nthe posterior or rectal part of the alimentary canal. Water enters the\r\ncanal through the anal opening and bathes these gills, bringing oxygen\r\nto them and taking away carbonic acid gas. The aquatic immature life\r\nof the dragon-flies lasts from a few months to two years. When ready\r\nto change to adult, the young crawls out of the water and clinging to\r\na rock or plant makes its last molt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--A dragon-fly, _Sympetrum illotum_, common in\r\nCalifornia. (From life.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--The young (nymph) of the dragon-fly,\r\n_Sympetrum illotum_. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Young (nymph) dragon-fly, showing lower lip\r\nfolded and extended. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Young (nymph) of May-fly, showing (_g_)\r\ntracheal gills. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nOther abundant and interesting pond and brook insects are the May-flies.\r\nThe young May-flies (fig. 61) are aquatic, living in streams and ponds\r\nand feeding on minute organisms such as diatoms and other algæ. The\r\nimmature life lasts a year, or even two or three in some species, and\r\nthen the May-fly crawls out of the water upon a plant-stem or projecting\r\nrock and, molting, appears as the winged adult. The adult May-fly,\r\nhaving its mouth-parts atrophied (a few May-flies have functional\r\nmouth-parts), takes no food, and lives only a few hours or at most\r\nperhaps a few days. It has the shortest life (in adult stage) of all\r\ninsects. The female drops her eggs into the water.\r\n\r\n    =Hemiptera: the sucking-bugs.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain specimens of\r\n    water-striders (narrow elongate-bodied insects with long spider-like\r\n    legs which run quickly about on the surface of ponds or quiet pools\r\n    in streams), water-boatmen (mottled grayish insects about half an\r\n    inch long which swim and dive about in ponds and stream-pools),\r\n    back-swimmers (which are usually in company with the water-boatmen,\r\n    but which swim with back downwards and are marked with\r\n    purplish-black and creamy white patches), cicadas (the dog-day\r\n    locusts), and plant-lice (the \"green fly\" of rose-bushes and other\r\n    cultivated plants). Compare the external structure of some of these\r\n    Hemiptera with the other insects already examined; note especially\r\n    the sucking beak, composed of the elongate tube-like labium in which\r\n    lie the greatly modified flexible needle-like maxillæ and mandibles,\r\n    the whole forming an equipment for piercing and sucking. Obtain\r\n    immature specimens of some of these insects (distinguished by their\r\n    smaller size and the wing-pads); note that the metamorphosis is\r\n    incomplete, the young resembling the parents in general appearance.\r\n    Both immature and adult specimens of water-boatmen (_Corisa_),\r\n    back-swimmers (_Notonecta_), and water-striders (_Hygrotrechus_)\r\n    can be easily kept in the laboratory aquaria- and their swimming,\r\n    breathing, and feeding habits observed. Note especially the carrying\r\n    of air down beneath the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--The female red orange scale insect,\r\n_Aspidiotus aurantii_, very injurious to orange-trees. It has no\r\nwings, legs, nor eyes, but remains motionless on a leaf, stem, or\r\nfruit, holding fast by its long slender beak, through which it sucks\r\nup the plant-sap. The male is winged, and has no mouth-parts, taking\r\nno food. (Photo-micrograph by Geo. O. Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--The female rose-scale, _Diaspis rosæ_, a pest\r\nof rose-bushes, without eyes, wings, or legs, but with slender sucking\r\nproboscis. The male is winged and without mouth-parts. (Photo-micrograph\r\nby Geo. O. Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\nThe Hemiptera are characterized particularly by their highly\r\nspecialized sucking mouth-parts, no other of the sucking insects\r\nhaving the proboscis composed in the same manner. The palpi of both\r\nmaxillæ and labium are wholly wanting in Hemiptera and the flexible\r\nneedle-like maxillæ and mandibles are enclosed in the tubular labium.\r\nThis order is a large one and includes many well-known injurious\r\nspecies, as the chinch-bug (_Blissus leucopterus_), which occurs in\r\nimmense numbers in the grain-fields of the Mississippi valley, sucking\r\nthe juices from the leaves of corn and wheat, the grape Phylloxera\r\n(_Phylloxera vastatrix_), so destructive to the vines of Europe and\r\nCalifornia, the scale insects (_Coccidæ_) (figs. 62 and 63), the\r\nworst insect pests of oranges, the squash-bugs and cabbage-bug and a\r\nhost of others. Some of the Hemiptera, for example, the lice and\r\nbed-bugs, are predaceous, sucking the blood of other animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--A water-strider, _Hygrotrechus_ sp. (From\r\nJenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nThe water-striders (fig. 64) catch other insects, both those that live\r\nin the water and those which fall on to its surface, and holding the\r\nprey with their seizing fore legs they pierce its body with their\r\nsharp beak and suck its blood. They lay their eggs in the spring glued\r\nfast to water-plants. The young water-striders are shorter and stouter\r\nin shape than the adults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--A water-boatman, _Corisa_ sp. (From Jenkins\r\nand Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nThe water-boatmen (fig. 65) and back-swimmers swim and dive about in the\r\nwater, coming more or less frequently to the surface to get a supply of\r\nair. This air they hold under the wings, or on the sides and under part\r\nof the body entangled in the fine hairs on the surface. The insects\r\nappear to have silvery spots on the body, due to the presence of this\r\nair. The \"rowing\" legs of the water-boatmen (_Corisa_) are the hindmost\r\npair; in the back-swimmers (_Notonecta_) they are the middle legs.\r\n\r\nThe cicadas (fig. 66) are the familiar insects of summer which sing\r\nso shrilly from the trees, the seventeen-year cicada (_Cicada\r\nseptendecim_) (oftentimes called locust) being the best known of this\r\nfamily. Its eggs are laid in slits cut by the female in live twigs.\r\nThe young, which hatch in about six weeks, do not feed on the green\r\nfoliage, but fall to the ground, burrow down to the roots of the tree\r\nand there live, sucking the juices from the roots, for sixteen years\r\nand ten or eleven months. When about to become adult, the young cicada\r\ncrawls up out of the ground and clinging to the tree-trunk molts for\r\nthe last time, and flies to the tree-tops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--The seventeen-year cicada, _Cicada\r\nseptendecim_; the specimen at left showing sound-making organ, _v.\r\np._, ventral plate; _t_, tympanum. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe plant-lice (_Aphididæ_) are small soft-bodied Hemiptera which have\r\nboth winged and wingless individuals. In the early spring a wingless\r\nfemale hatches from an egg which, laid in the preceding fall, has\r\npassed the winter in slow development. This wingless female, called\r\nthe stem-mother, lays unfertilized eggs or more often perhaps gives\r\nbirth to live young, all of which are similarly wingless females which\r\nreproduce parthenogenetically. This reproduction goes on so rapidly\r\nthat the plant-lice become overcrowded on the food-plant and then a\r\ngeneration of winged[14] individuals is produced from time to time.\r\nThese winged plant-lice fly away to new plants. In the autumn a\r\ngeneration of males and females is produced; these individuals mate\r\nand each female lays a single large egg which goes over the winter,\r\nand produces in the spring the wingless agamic stem-mother. Plant-lice\r\nproduce honey-dew, a sweetish substance much liked by ants, and the\r\nlice are often visited, and sometimes specially cared for, by the ants\r\nfor the sake of this honey-dew. Small as they are, plant-lice occur in\r\nsuch numbers as to do great damage to the plants on which they feed.\r\nThe apple-aphis, cherry-aphis, pear-aphis, cabbage-aphis and others\r\nare well-known pests. The most notoriously destructive plant-louse is\r\nthe grape _Phylloxera_, which lives on the roots and leaves of the\r\ngrape-vine. Immense losses have been caused by this pest, especially\r\nin the wine-producing countries of southern Europe.\r\n\r\n    =Diptera: the flies.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain specimens of the\r\n    adult and young stages of the blowfly and the mosquito. All the\r\n    young stages of the blowfly may be obtained, and its life-history\r\n    studied, by exposing a piece of meat to decay in an open glass\r\n    jar. The larvæ of the mosquito are the familiar wrigglers of\r\n    puddles and ponds, and by collecting some of them and keeping them\r\n    in a glass jar of water covered with a bit of mosquito-netting,\r\n    the life-history of the mosquito is easily studied. If the eggs\r\n    can be obtained from the pond so much the better; they are in\r\n    little black masses floating on the surface of the water, and\r\n    resemble at first glance nothing so much as a floating bit of\r\n    soot. The external structure of the adult flies should be compared\r\n    with that of the other insects studied, noting especially the\r\n    condition of mouth-parts and wings, and the substitution of\r\n    balancers for the hind wings. The mouth-parts of the mosquito are\r\n    in the form of a long proboscis composed of six slender\r\n    needle-like stylets lying in a tube narrowly open along its dorsal\r\n    surface. The tube is the labium, and the stylets are the two\r\n    maxillæ, two mandibles, and two other parts known as the\r\n    epipharynx and the hypopharynx. Two additional thicker elongate\r\n    segmented processes lying outside of and parallel with the tube\r\n    are the maxillary palpi. The male mosquito (distinguished from the\r\n    female by the more hairy or bushier antennæ) lacks the pair of\r\n    needle-like mandibles. The mouth-parts of the blowfly are composed\r\n    almost exclusively of the thick fleshy proboscis-like labium,\r\n    which is expanded at the tip to form a rasping organ.\r\n\r\nThe Diptera or true flies are readily distinguishable from other\r\ninsects by their having a single pair of wings instead of two pairs,\r\nthe hind wings being transformed into small knob-headed pedicels\r\ncalled balancers or halteres. The flies undergo complete\r\nmetamorphosis, and their mouth-parts are fitted for piercing and\r\nsucking (as in the mosquito) or for rasping and lapping (as in the\r\nblowfly). Nearly 50,000 species of flies are known, more than 4,000\r\nbeing known in North America alone.\r\n\r\nThe blowfly (_Calliphora vomitoria_) is common in houses, but can be\r\ndistinguished from the house-fly by its larger size and its steel-blue\r\nabdomen. It lays its eggs on decaying meat (or other organic matter)\r\nand the white footless larvæ (maggots) hatch in about twenty-four\r\nhours. They feed voraciously and become full grown in a few days. They\r\nthen change into pupæ which are brown and seed-like, being completely\r\nenclosed in a uniform chitinized case which wholly conceals the form\r\nof the developing fly. The house-fly has a life-history and immature\r\nstages like the blowfly, but its eggs are deposited on manure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--The mosquito, _Culex_ sp.; showing eggs (on\r\nsurface of water), larvæ (long and slender, in water), pupa (large\r\nheaded, at surface), and adult (in air). (From living specimens.)]\r\n\r\nThe mosquito (_Culex_ sp.) (fig. 67) lays its eggs in a sooty-black\r\nlittle boat-shaped mass which floats lightly on the surface of the\r\nwater. In a few days the larvæ, or \"wrigglers,\" issue and swim about\r\nvigorously by bending the body. The head end of the body is much\r\nbroader than the other, the thoracic segments being markedly larger\r\nthan the abdominal ones. The head bears a pair of vibrating tufts of\r\nhairs, which set up currents of air that bring microscopic organic\r\nparticles in the water into the wriggler's mouth. At the posterior tip\r\nof the body are two projections, one the breathing-tube (the wriggler\r\ncoming often to the surface to breathe), and the other the real tip of\r\nthe abdomen. The wriggler, although heavier than water, can hang\r\nsuspended from the surface film by the tip of its breathing-tube. It\r\nchanges in a few days into the pupa, which, instead of being quiescent\r\nas with most flies, can swim about. It has a large bulbous head end\r\nand the posterior end of the body bears a pair of swimming-flaps. It\r\ntakes no food. When ready to change to the adult mosquito the pupa\r\n(which, unlike the wriggler, is lighter than water) floats at the\r\nsurface of the water, back uppermost. The chitinous cuticle splits\r\nalong the back and the delicate mosquito comes out, rests on the\r\nfloating pupal skin until its wings are dry, and then flies away. Only\r\nthe female mosquitoes suck blood. If they cannot find animals,\r\nmosquitoes live on the juices of plants. They are world-wide in their\r\ndistribution, being serious pests even in Arctic regions, where they\r\nare often intolerably numerous and greedy. Recent investigations have\r\nshown that the germs which cause malaria in man live also in the\r\nbodies of mosquitoes, and are introduced into the blood of human\r\nbeings by the biting (piercing) of the mosquitoes. It is probable\r\nalso that the germs of yellow fever are distributed by mosquitoes in\r\nthe same way. By pouring a little kerosene on the surface of a puddle\r\nno mosquitoes will be able to escape from the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--The house-flea, _Pulex irritans_; _a_, larva;\r\n_b_, pupa; _c_, adult. (The fleas are probably more nearly related to\r\nthe Diptera than to any other order of insects.) (After Beneden.)]\r\n\r\n    =Lepidoptera: the moths and butterflies.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain\r\n    specimens of a few moths, and compare with the butterfly already\r\n    studied; note especially the character of antennæ. Obtain\r\n    miscellaneous specimens of larvæ, pupæ, and cocoons of any moths or\r\n    butterflies. Note the variety in colors, markings, and skin\r\n    coverings of the larvæ; note the shape and markings of the pupæ.\r\n    Rear from eggs, larvæ, or pupæ in breeding-cages any moths and\r\n    butterflies obtainable (for directions for rearing moths and\r\n    butterflies see Chapter XXXIV), keeping note of the times of molting\r\n    and of the duration of the various immature stages. If the eggs of\r\n    silkworms can be obtained the whole life cycle of the silkworm moth\r\n    can be observed in the schoolroom. The larvæ (worms) feed on\r\n    mulberry or osage orange leaves, feeding voraciously, growing\r\n    rapidly and making no attempts to escape. The molting of the larvæ\r\n    can be observed, the spinning of the silken cocoon, and the final\r\n    emergence of the moth. The moths after emergence will not fly away,\r\n    but if put on a bit of cloth will mate, and lay their eggs on it.\r\n    From these eggs, which should be kept well aired and dry, larvæ will\r\n    hatch in nine or ten months (if the race is an \"annual\").\r\n\r\nThe Lepidoptera (figs. 69-74) include all those insects familiarly\r\nknown to us as moths and butterflies; they are characterized by their\r\nscale-covered wings (fig. 69) and long nectar-sucking proboscis\r\ncomposed of the two interlocking maxillæ. They undergo a complete\r\nmetamorphosis (fig. 70) and their larvæ are the familiar caterpillars\r\nof garden and field. These larvæ have biting mouth-parts and feed on\r\nvegetation, some of them being very injurious, for example the\r\narmy-worms, cut-worms, codlin moth worms, etc. The adult moths and\r\nbutterflies take only liquid food, or no food at all, and are wholly\r\nharmless to vegetation. The structure and life-history of a butterfly\r\nhas already been studied, and in the more general conditions of\r\nstructure and life-history there is much similarity in the many\r\ninsects of this order. The eggs are usually laid on the food-plant of\r\nthe larva; the larva feeds on the leaves of this plant, grows, molts\r\nseveral times, and pupates either in the ground or in a silken cocoon\r\nor simply attached to a branch or leaf. There are about six thousand\r\nspecies of moths and butterflies known in North America, and they are\r\nour most beautiful insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--A small, partly denuded part, much magnified,\r\nof a wing of a \"blue\" butterfly, _Lycæna_ sp., showing the wing,\r\nscales and the pits in the wing-membrane, in which the tiny stems of\r\nthe scales are inserted.

Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\n    =Coleoptera: the beetles.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain specimens of\r\n    various beetles, among them some water-beetles and June-beetles\r\n    with their young stages, if possible; if not, then the young\r\n    stages and adults of any beetle common in the neighborhood of the\r\n    school. Of the swimming and diving water-beetles there are three\r\n    families, viz., the Gyrinidæ or whirligig beetles, with four eyes\r\n    (each compound eye divided in two), the Hydrophilidæ, or\r\n    water-scavengers with two eyes and antennæ with the terminal\r\n    segments thicker than the others, and the Dytiscidæ or predaceous\r\n    water-beetles with two eyes and slender thread-like antennæ. Try\r\n    to find Dytiscidæ, large, oval, shining black beetles; the larvæ\r\n    are called water-tigers and are long, slim, active creatures with\r\n    six legs and slender curving jaws (see fig. 76). The June-beetles\r\n    are the heavy brown buzzing \"June-bugs\" and their larvæ are the\r\n    common \"white grubs\" found underground in lawns and pastures. Have\r\n    live water-tigers and predaceous water-beetles in the aquarium.\r\n    Note their feeding and breathing. Compare the external structure\r\n    of the beetles with that of the other insects, noting especially\r\n    the biting mouth-parts, and their thickened horny fore wings\r\n    serving as covers for the folded membranous hind wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--The forest tent-caterpillar moth, _Clisiocampa\r\ndisstria_, in its various stages; _m_, male moth; _f_, female moth; _p_,\r\npupa; _e_, eggs (in a ring) recently laid; _g_, eggs hatched; _c_, larva\r\nor caterpillar.

(Photograph from life by M. V. Slingerland.)]\r\n\r\nThe Coleoptera is the largest insect order, probably 100,000 species\r\nof beetles being known, of which 10,000 species are found in North\r\nAmerica. They pass through a complete metamorphosis (figs. 75 and 76),\r\nthe larvæ of the various kinds showing much variety in form and\r\nhabit. The pupæ are quiescent and are mummy-like in appearance, the\r\nlegs and wings being folded and pressed to the ventral surface of the\r\nbody. Among the familiar beetles are the lady-birds, which are\r\nbeneficial insects feeding on plant-lice and other noxious forms; the\r\nbeautifully colored tiger-beetles, predaceous in habit; the\r\n\"tumblebugs\" and carrion beetles, which feed on decaying organic\r\nmatter; the luminous fire-flies with their phosphorescent organs on\r\nthe ventral part of the abdomen; the striped Colorado potato-beetle\r\nand the cucumber-beetles and numerous other destructive leaf-eating\r\nkinds; the various weevils (fig. 78) that bore into fruits, nuts and\r\ngrains, and the many wood-boring beetles, destructive to fruit-trees\r\nas well as to shade- and forest-trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Moths of the peach-tree borer, _Sanninoidea\r\nexitiosa_, natural size; the upper one and the one at the right are\r\nfemales. (Photograph by M. V. Slingerland.)]\r\n\r\nThe predaceous water-beetles (_Dyticus_ sp.) are common in ponds and\r\nquiet pools in streams. When at rest they hang head downward with the\r\ntip of the abdomen just projecting from the water. Air is taken under\r\nthe tips of the folded wing-covers (elytra) and accumulates so that it\r\ncan be breathed while the beetle swims and feeds under water. When the\r\nair becomes impure the beetle rises to the surface, forces it out, and\r\naccumulates a fresh supply. The beetles are very voracious, feeding on\r\nother insects, and even on small fish. The eggs are laid promiscuously\r\nin the water, and the elongate spindle-form larvæ (fig. 77) called\r\nwater-tigers are also predaceous. They suck the blood from other insects\r\nthrough their sharp-pointed sickle-shaped hollow mandibles. When a larva\r\nis fully grown it leaves the water, burrows in the ground, and makes a\r\nround cell within which it undergoes its transformations. The pupa state\r\nlasts about three weeks in summer, but the larvæ that transform in\r\nautumn remain in the pupa state all winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Army-worms, larvæ of the moth, _Leucania\r\nunipuncta_, on corn.

Slingerland.)]\r\n\r\nThe June-beetles (June-bugs) (_Lachnosterna_ sp.) feed on the foliage\r\nof trees. Their eggs are laid among the roots of grass in little\r\nhollow balls of earth, and the fat sluggish white larvæ feed on the\r\ngrass-roots. They sometimes occur in such numbers as to injure\r\nseriously lawns and meadows. The larvæ live three years (probably)\r\nbefore pupating. They pupate underground in an earthen cell, from\r\nwhich the adult beetle crawls out and flies up to the tree-tops.\r\n\r\n    =Hymenoptera: the ichneumon flies, ants, wasps, and\r\n    bees.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain specimens of wasps, both social\r\n    (distinguished by having each wing folded longitudinally) and\r\n    solitary (wings not folded longitudinally), and if possible of both\r\n    queens (larger) and workers (smaller) of the social kinds; of ants\r\n    both winged (males or females) and wingless (workers) individuals;\r\n    also of honey-bees, including a queen, drones, and workers, and some\r\n    brood comb containing eggs, larvæ, and pupæ. The bee specimens can\r\n    be got of a bee raiser. Compare the external structure of ants,\r\n    bees, and wasps with that of other insects; note the pronounced\r\n    division of the body into three regions (head, thorax, abdomen);\r\n    note the character of the mouth-parts having mandibles fitted for\r\n    biting (ants and wasps) or moulding wax (honey-bees) and having the\r\n    other parts adapted for taking both solid and liquid food; note the\r\n    sting (possessed by the females and workers only). Observe the\r\n    behavior of bees in and about a hive; note the coming and going of\r\n    workers for food. Observe bees collecting pollen at flowers; observe\r\n    them drinking nectar. Examine the honey-bee in its various stages,\r\n    egg, larva, pupa, adult. Note the special structure of the adult\r\n    worker fitting it to perform its various special labors; the\r\n    pollen-baskets on the hind legs; the wax-plates on the ventral\r\n    surface of the abdomen, the wax-shears between tibia and tarsus of\r\n    hind legs; the antennæ-cleaners on the fore legs; the hooks on front\r\n    margin of hind wings, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Immature stages of the quince curculio,\r\n_Conotrachelus cratægi_; at the left, the larva natural size and\r\nenlarged; at the right, the pupa. The beetle lays its eggs in pits on\r\nquinces, and the larva lives inside the quince as a grub; the pupa\r\nlives in the ground. (Photograph by M. V. Slingerland.)]\r\n\r\nThe Hymenoptera include the familiar ants, bees, and wasps, and also a\r\nhost of other four-winged, mostly small, insects, many of which are\r\nparasites in their larval stage on other insects. All Hymenoptera have\r\na complete metamorphosis, and their habits and instincts are, as a\r\nrule, very highly specialized. The parasitic Hymenoptera such as the\r\nichneumon flies, chalcid flies, etc., are stingless but have usually a\r\npiercing ovipositor (the sting being only a modified ovipositor). The\r\ngeneral life-history of these ichneumons is as follows: the female\r\nichneumon fly, finding one of the caterpillars or fly or beetle larvæ\r\nwhich is its host, settles on it and either lays an egg or several\r\neggs on it, or thrusting in its ovipositor, lays the eggs in the body;\r\nthe young ichneumon hatching as a grub burrows into the body of its\r\ncaterpillar host, feeding on the body-tissues, but not attacking the\r\nheart or nervous system, so that the host is not soon killed; the\r\nichneumon pupates either inside the host, or crawls out and, spinning\r\na little silken cocoon (fig. 160), pupates on the surface of the body\r\nor elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Water-tiger, the larva of the predaceous\r\nwater-beetle, _Dyticus_ sp. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nSome of the stingless Hymenoptera are not parasites, but are\r\ngall-producers. The female with its piercing ovipositor lays an egg in\r\nthe soft tissue of a leaf or stem, and after the larva hatches the\r\ngall rapidly forms. The larval insect lies in the plant-tissue, having\r\nfor food the sap which comes to the rapidly growing gall. It pupates\r\nin the gall, and when adult eats its way out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--The plum curculio, _Conotrachelus nenuphar_,\r\na beetle very injurious to plums. (Photograph by M. V. Slingerland.)]\r\n\r\nThe ants, bees, and wasps are called the stinging Hymenoptera,\r\nalthough the ants we have in North America have their sting so reduced\r\nas to be no longer usable. Among these Hymenoptera are the social or\r\ncommunal insects, viz., all the ants, the bumblebees and honey-bee,\r\nand the few social wasps, as the yellow-jacket and black hornet. There\r\nare many more species of non-social or solitary bees and wasps than\r\nsocial ones, and their habits and instincts are nearly as remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--The currant-stem girdler, _Janus integer_, a\r\nHymenopteron at work girdling a stem after having deposited an egg in\r\nthe stem half an inch lower down. (Photograph by M. V. Slingerland.)]\r\n\r\nThe solitary and digger wasps do not live in communities as the\r\nhornets do, but each female makes a nest or several nests of her own,\r\nlays eggs and provides for her own young. The nest is usually a short\r\nvertical or inclined burrow in the ground, with the bottom enlarged to\r\nform a cell or chamber. In this chamber a single egg is laid, and some\r\ninsects or spiders, captured and so stung by the wasps as to be\r\nparalyzed but not killed, are put in for food. The nest is then closed\r\nup by the female, and the larva hatching from the egg feeds on the\r\nenclosed helpless insects until full grown, when it pupates in the\r\ncell and the issuing adult gnaws and pushes its way out of the ground.\r\nEach species of wasp has habits peculiar to itself, making always the\r\nsame kind of nest, and providing always the same kind of food. Some of\r\nthese wasps make their nests in twigs of various plants, especially\r\nthose with pithy centres in the stems. For interesting accounts of the\r\nhabits of several digger wasps see Peckham's \"The Solitary Wasps.\"\r\n\r\nThe solitary bees, of which there are similarly many kinds, are like\r\nthe solitary wasps in general habit, only they provision the nest with\r\na mixture of pollen and nectar got from flowers instead of with stung\r\ninsects. Sometimes many individuals of a single species of solitary\r\nbee will make their nests near together and thus form a sort of\r\ncommunity in which, however, each member has its own nest and rears\r\nits own young. In the case of certain small mining bees of the genus\r\n_Halictus_, a step farther toward true communal life is taken by the\r\ncommon building and use by several females of a single vertical tunnel\r\nor burrow from which each female makes an individual lateral tunnel,\r\nat the end of which is a brood-chamber. Perhaps half a dozen females\r\nwill thus live together, each independent except for the common use of\r\nthe vertical tunnel and exit.\r\n\r\nThe bumblebees (_Bombus_ sp.) are truly communal in habit. All the\r\neggs are laid by a queen or fertile female, which is the only member\r\nof the colony to live through the winter. In the spring she finds a\r\ndeserted mouse's nest or other hole in the ground, gathers a mass of\r\npollen and lays some eggs on it. The larvæ, hatching, feed on the\r\npollen, dig out irregular cells for themselves in it, pupate, and soon\r\nissue as workers, or infertile females. These workers gather more\r\npollen, the queen lays more eggs, and several successive broods of\r\nworkers are produced. Finally late in the summer a brood containing\r\nmales (drones) and fertile females (queens) is produced, mating takes\r\nplace, and then before winter all the workers and drones and some of\r\nthe queens die, leaving a few fertilized queens to hibernate and\r\nestablish new communities in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe yellow-jackets and hornets (Vespidæ), the so-called social wasps,\r\nhave a life-history very like that of the bumblebees. The communities\r\nof the social wasps are larger and their nests are often made above\r\nground, being composed of several combs one above the other and all\r\nenclosed in a many-layered covering sac open only by a small hole at\r\nthe bottom. This kind of nest hangs from the branch of a tree and is\r\nbuilt of wasp-paper, which is a pulp made from bits of old wood chewed\r\nby the workers. The brood-cells are provisioned with killed and chewed\r\ninsects, the larvæ of both solitary and social wasps being given\r\nanimal food, while the larvæ of both solitary and social bees are fed\r\nflower-pollen and honey. As in the bumblebees, all the members of the\r\ncommunity except a few fertilized females die in the autumn, the\r\nsurviving queens founding new colonies in the spring. The queen builds\r\na miniature \"hornet's nest\" in the spring, lays an egg in each cell\r\nand stores the cells with chewed insects. The first brood is composed\r\nof workers, which enlarge the nest, get more food, and relieve the\r\nqueen of all labor except that of egg-laying. More broods of workers\r\nfollow until the fall brood of males and females appears, after which\r\nthe original process is repeated.\r\n\r\nThe honey-bees and ants show a highly specialized communal life, with\r\na well-marked division of labor and an individual sacrifice of\r\nindependence and personal advantage which is remarkable. Their\r\ncommunities are large, including thousands of individuals, and the\r\nstructural differences among the males, females, and workers are\r\nreadily recognizable. With the ants the workers may be of two or more\r\nsorts, a distinction into large and small workers or worker majors and\r\nworker minors being not uncommon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--The honey-bee, _Apis mellifica_; _A_, queen,\r\n_B_, drone, _C_, worker. (From specimens.)]\r\n\r\nA honey-bee community, living in hollow tree or hive, includes a queen\r\nor fertile female, a few hundred drones or fertile males, and ten to\r\nforty thousand workers, infertile females (fig. 80). The number of\r\ndrones and workers varies, being smallest in winter. Each kind of\r\nindividual has a certain particular part of the work of the whole\r\ncommunity to do; the queen lays all the eggs, that is, is the mother of\r\nthe entire community; the drones act simply as the royal consorts,\r\nfertilizing the eggs; while the workers build the comb, produce the wax\r\nfrom which the cells are constructed, bring in all the food consisting\r\nof flower-pollen and nectar, care for the young bees, fight off\r\nintruders, and in fact perform all the many labors and industries of the\r\ncommunity except those of reproduction. There is a certain not very well\r\nunderstood and perhaps not very sharply defined division of these labors\r\namong the worker individuals, the younger ones acting specially as\r\n\"nurses,\" feeding and caring for the young bees (larvæ and pupæ), the\r\nolder ones making the food-gathering expeditions. The queen lays her\r\neggs one in each of many cells (fig. 81). These eggs hatch in three\r\ndays, and the young bee appears as a white, soft, footless, helpless\r\ngrub or larva that is fed at first by the nurses with a highly\r\nnutritious substance called bee-jelly which the nurses make in their\r\nstomachs and regurgitate for the larva. After two or three days of this\r\nfeeding the larvæ are fed pollen and honey. After a few days a small\r\nmass of this food is put into the cell, which is then \"capped\" or\r\ncovered with wax. The larva after using up this food-supply pupates, and\r\nlies quiescent in the pupal stage for thirteen days, when the fully\r\ndeveloped bee issues, and breaking through the wax cap of the cell is\r\nready for the labors which are immediately assigned it. The bee with the\r\nkind of life-history just described is a worker. It has been\r\ndemonstrated that the eggs which produce workers and those which produce\r\nqueens do not differ, but if the workers desire to have a queen produced\r\nthey tear down two or three cells around some one cell, enlarging this\r\nlatter into a large vase-shaped cell. When the larva hatches from the\r\negg in this cell it is fed for its whole larval life with bee-jelly.\r\nFrom the pupa into which this larva transforms issues not a worker but a\r\nnew queen. The eggs which produce drones or males differ from those\r\nwhich produce queens and workers in being unfertilized, the queen having\r\nthe power to lay either fertilized or unfertilized eggs. When a new\r\nqueen appears or when several appear at once there is great excitement\r\nin the community. If several appear they fight among themselves until\r\nonly one survives. It is said that a queen never uses its sting except\r\nagainst another queen. The old queen now leaves the hive accompanied by\r\nmany of the workers. She and her followers fly away together, finally\r\nalighting on some tree-branch and massing there in a dense swarm. This\r\nis the familiar act of \"swarming.\" Scouts leave the swarm to find a new\r\nhome, to which they finally conduct the whole swarm. Thus is founded a\r\nnew colony. \"This swarming of the honey-bee is essential to the\r\ncontinued existence of the species; for in social insects it is as\r\nnecessary that the colonies be multiplied as it is that there should be\r\na reproduction of individuals. Otherwise as the colonies were destroyed\r\nthe species would become extinct. With the social wasps and with the\r\nbumblebees the old queen and the young ones remain together peacefully\r\nin the nest; but at the close of the season the nest is abandoned by all\r\nas an unfit place for passing the winter, and in the following spring\r\neach young queen founds a new colony. Thus there is a tendency towards a\r\ngreat multiplication of colonies. But with the honey-bee the habit of\r\nstoring food for winter, and the nature of the habitations of these\r\ninsects, render it possible for the colonies to exist indefinitely, and\r\nthus if the old and young queens remained together peacefully there\r\nwould be no multiplication of colonies and the species would surely die\r\nout in time. We see, therefore, that what appears to be merely jealousy\r\non the part of the queen honey-bee is an instinct necessary to the\r\ncontinuance of the species.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Worker brood and queen cells of honey-bee;\r\nbeginning at the right end of upper row of cells and going to the left\r\nis a series of egg, young larvæ, old larvæ, pupa, and adult ready to\r\nissue; the large curving cells below are queen cells.

(From Benton.)]\r\n\r\nThe gathering of food from long distances, the details of wax-making\r\nand comb-building, of honey-making (for the nectar of flowers is made\r\ninto honey by an interesting process), the storing of food, how the\r\ncommunity protects itself from starvation when winter sets in or food\r\nis scarce by killing the useless drones and the immature bees in egg\r\nand larval stage, and many other phenomena of the life of the bee\r\ncommunity present good opportunities for careful observation and field\r\nstudy. Although the community is a persistent or continuous one, the\r\nindividuals do not live long, the workers hatched in the spring\r\nusually not more than two or three months, and those hatched in the\r\nfall not more than six or eight months. But new ones are hatching\r\nwhile the old ones are dying and the community as a whole always\r\npersists. A queen may live several years, perhaps as many as five. She\r\nlays about one million eggs a year.\r\n\r\nThere are more than two thousand known species of ants (fig. 84), all\r\nof which live in communities and show a truly communal life. The ant\r\nworkers are specially distinguished in structure from the males and\r\nfemales by being wingless, and in numerous species there are two sizes\r\nor kinds of workers known as worker majors and worker minors. The\r\nlife-history and communal habits of ants are not so thoroughly known\r\nas are those of the honey-bee, but they show even more remarkable\r\nspecializations. The ant nest or formicary is with most species an\r\nelaborate system of underground galleries and chambers, special rooms\r\nbeing used exclusively for certain special purposes, as nurse-rooms,\r\nfood-storage rooms, etc. The food of ants comprises many animal and\r\nvegetable substances, but the favorite food with many species is the\r\n\"honey-dew\" secreted by the plant-lice (Aphididæ) and scale insects\r\n(Coccidæ). To obtain this food an ant strokes one of the aphids with\r\nits antennæ, when the fluid is excreted by the insect and drunk by the\r\nant. In order to have a certain supply of this food some species of\r\nants care for and defend these defenseless aphids, which have been\r\ncalled the \"cattle\" of the ants. In some cases they are even taken\r\ninto the ants' nests and food provided for them. \"In the Mississippi\r\nValley a certain kind of plant-louse lives on the roots of corn. Its\r\neggs are deposited in the ground in the autumn and hatch the following\r\nspring before the corn is planted. Now the common little brown ant\r\n(_Lasius flavus_) lives abundantly in the cornfields, and is\r\nespecially fond of the honey secreted by the corn-root louse. So when\r\nthe plant-lice hatch in the spring before there are corn-roots for\r\nthem to feed on, the little brown ants with great solicitude carefully\r\nplace the plant-lice on the roots of a certain kind of knot-weed which\r\ngrows in the field and protect them until the corn germinates. Then\r\nthe ants remove the plant-lice to the roots of the corn, their\r\nfavorite food-plant. In the arid lands of New Mexico and Arizona the\r\nants rear scale insects on the roots of cactus.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--The little black ant, _Monomorium minutum_;\r\n_a_, female, _b_, female with wings, _c_, male, _d_, workers, _e_,\r\npupa, _f_, larva, _g_, egg of worker, all enlarged. (From Marlatt.)]\r\n\r\nThe ants are among the most warlike of insects. Battles between\r\ncommunities of different species are numerous, and the victorious\r\ncommunity takes possession of the food-stores of the conquered. Some\r\nspecies of ants live wholly by war and robbery. In the case of the\r\nremarkable robber-ant (_Eciton_), found in tropical and subtropical\r\nregions, most of the workers are soldiers, and no longer do any work\r\nbut fighting. The whole community lives exclusively by pillage. Some\r\nkinds of ants go even farther than mere robbery of food-stores: they\r\nmake slaves of the conquered ants. There are numerous species of these\r\nslave-making ants. They attack a nest of another species and carry\r\ninto their own nest the eggs and larvæ and pupæ of the conquered\r\ncommunity, and when these come to maturity they act as slaves of the\r\nvictors, collecting food, building additions to the nest, and caring\r\nfor the young of the slave-makers.\r\n\r\nAs with the honey-bee the larval ants are helpless grubs and are cared\r\nfor and fed by nurses. The so-called \"ants' eggs,\" the little white\r\noval masses which we often see being carried in the mouths of ants in\r\nand out of an ants' nest, are not eggs, but are the pupæ which are\r\nbeing brought out to enjoy the warmth and light of the sun or being\r\ntaken back into the nest afterward.\r\n\r\nThere are in this country numerous species of ants showing much variety\r\nof habit and offering excellent opportunities for most interesting field\r\nobservations. For an account of several of the common species see\r\nComstock's \"Manual of Insects,\" pp. 633-643. Ants may be readily kept in\r\nthe schoolroom in an artificial nest or formicary and their life-history\r\nand habits closely watched. For full directions for making and keeping a\r\nsimple and inexpensive formicary see Comstock's \"Insect Life,\" pp.\r\n278-281. For an interesting account of some of the habits of the social\r\ninsects see Lubbock's \"Ants, Bees, and Wasps.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n              CLASS MYRIAPODA: THE MYRIAPODS, OR CENTIPEDS\r\n                             AND MILLIPEDS.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the branch Arthropoda, with the classes Crustacea and\r\nInsecta, are three other classes, of which one, the Onychophora, is\r\nrepresented by a single genus _Peripatus_ (Fig. 85), of extremely\r\ninteresting animals. However, as these animals are not found in the\r\nUnited States we cannot study them. The other two classes are the\r\nMyriapoda, including the centipeds and millipeds or thousand-legged\r\nworms, and the Arachnida, including the scorpions, spiders, mites, and\r\nticks. All these animals are often spoken of as insects, but though\r\nrelated to them they are not true insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--_Peripatus eiseni_ (Mexico). (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--From under stones or logs obtain specimens of\r\n    millipeds, or thousand-legged worms (large blackish, cylindrical,\r\n    worm-like animals with each body-segment back of the fourth bearing\r\n    two pairs of jointed legs); also specimens of centipeds or\r\n    hundred-legged worms (flattened, usually brownish or pale worm-like\r\n    animals with the body-segments bearing only one pair of legs each)\r\n    in the same places. Examine the external structure; note number of\r\n    body-rings; division into body-regions; presence of antennæ;\r\n    character and number of eyes; character of mouth-parts; character\r\n    and arrangement of legs. In the centipeds the first pair of legs is\r\n    modified to form a pair of poison-fangs. They appear to belong to\r\n    the mouth-parts. The internal anatomy will be found to be, if\r\n    examined, much like that of insects and can be studied from the\r\n    account of the anatomy of the water-scavenger beetle and butterfly\r\n    larva. Compare the Myriapods with the Hexapods or true insects. What\r\n    are the points of resemblance? what are the points of difference?\r\n\r\nThe Myriapoda are land-animals breathing by means of tracheæ like the\r\ninsects. In them the body-segments are nearly uniform in character with\r\nthe exception of the head, which, as in the insects, bears the\r\nmouth-parts and antennæ. There is no grouping of the body-segments into\r\nregions except as the head is opposed to the rest of the body. (In a few\r\nmyriapods there are indications of a division of the hind body into\r\nthorax and abdomen.) The presence of true legs on all the segments of\r\nthe hinder region of the body and the lack of the three-region division\r\nof the body are the principal external structural characteristics which\r\ndistinguish myriapods from insects. The internal anatomy corresponds in\r\ngeneral character with that of insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--A galley-worm (milliped), _Julus_ sp. (From\r\nspecimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe most familiar myriapods are the millipeds, and the lithobians and\r\ncentipeds. The millipeds are cylindrical in shape, have two pairs of\r\nlegs on most of the body-segments and are vegetable feeders, though\r\nsome may feed on dead animal matter. The galley-worms (_Julus_) (fig.\r\n86), large, blackish, cylindrical millipeds found under stones and\r\nlogs and leaves and in loose soil, are familiar forms. They crawl\r\nslowly and when disturbed curl up and emit a malodorous fluid. They\r\ncan easily be kept alive in shallow glass vessels with a layer of\r\nearth in the bottom, and their habits and life-history may thus be\r\nstudied. They should be fed sliced apples, green leaves, grass,\r\nstrawberries, fresh ears of corn, etc. They are not poisonous and may\r\nbe handled with impunity. They lay their eggs in little spherical\r\ncells or nests in the ground. An English species of which the\r\nlife-history has been studied lays from 60 to 100 eggs at a time. The\r\neggs of this species hatch in about twelve days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--The skein centiped, _Scutigera forceps_,\r\nnatural size, common in houses and conservatories. (From Marlatt.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--A centiped, _Scolopendra_ sp. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe lithobians and centipeds are flattened and have but a single pair\r\nof legs on each body-ring. They are predaceous in habit, catching and\r\nkilling insects, snails, earthworms, etc. They can run rapidly, and\r\nhave the first pair of legs modified into a pair of poison-claws,\r\nwhich are bent forward so as to lie near the mouth. The common \"skein\"\r\ncentiped (_Scutigera forceps_) (fig. 87) is yellowish and has fifteen\r\npairs of legs, long 40-segmented antennæ, and nine large and six\r\nsmaller dorsal segmental plates. The true centipeds (_Scolopendra_)\r\n(fig. 88) have twenty-one to twenty-three body-rings, each with a pair\r\nof legs, and the antennæ have seventeen to twenty joints. They live in\r\nwarm regions, some growing to be very large, as long as twelve inches\r\nor more. The \"bite\" or wound made by the poison-claws is fatal to\r\ninsects and other small animals, their prey, and painful or even\r\ndangerous to man. The popular notion that a centiped \"stings\" with all\r\nof its feet is fallacious. It is recorded by Humboldt that centipeds\r\nare eaten by some of the South American Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n            CLASS ARACHNIDA: THE SCORPIONS, SPIDERS, MITES,\r\n                               AND TICKS.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain specimens of various spiders; the running\r\n    or hunting spiders may be found on the ground, especially under\r\n    stones and boards, the web-makers on their snares. Get also\r\n    spiders' \"cocoons\" (egg-sacs). Examine the external structure of\r\n    the spider; note the two body-regions; the number and character of\r\n    legs; the absence of antennæ; the number and arrangement of the\r\n    eyes (which are simple, not compound); the mouth-parts, especially\r\n    the large mandibles; the spinnerets at the tip of the abdomen\r\n    (examine a cut off spinneret under the microscope to see the\r\n    spinning-tubes); note the breathing openings or spiracles on under\r\n    side of abdomen. Obtain also a scorpion if possible, and some\r\n    ticks and mites. Compare with the spiders and note that in the\r\n    scorpion the body is plainly seen (especially in the abdomen) to\r\n    be composed of segments. Note the extreme fusion of the segments\r\n    and body-regions in the mites and ticks. The common red spider of\r\n    hothouses and gardens is a mite; ticks may sometimes be found on\r\n    dogs. Observe various kinds of spider-webs, and try to observe the\r\n    process of web-making (this can be observed early in the morning\r\n    or about dusk) by one of the orb-weaving garden-spiders. Live\r\n    spiders can be kept in the schoolroom and their feeding habits and\r\n    perhaps web-making habits observed.\r\n\r\nThe class Arachnida is composed of Arthropods whose body-segments are\r\ngrouped into two regions, a cephalothorax bearing the mouth-parts,\r\neyes, and legs, and an abdomen. The segments composing these two parts\r\nare so fused that, except in the scorpions, they are usually\r\nindistinguishable. There are no antennæ, the eyes are simple, the\r\nmouth-parts fitted for biting, and there are four pairs of legs. In\r\ntheir internal anatomy the arachnids show in some forms a peculiar\r\nmodification of the respiratory organs, the tracheæ being flat and\r\nleaf-like and massed together in a few groups rather than being\r\ntubular and ramifying through the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--A scorpion, _Centrurus_ sp., from California.\r\n(From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe dorsal vessel or heart usually has a few blood-vessels or arteries\r\nrunning from it. This class is divided into three orders, the\r\nArthrogastra, or scorpions, the Acarina, or mites and ticks, and the\r\nAraneina, or spiders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--The cheese-mite, _Tyroglyphus siro_, greatly\r\nenlarged. (After Berlese.)]\r\n\r\nThe scorpions (fig. 89) have the posterior six segments of the abdomen\r\nmuch narrower than the seven anterior segments and forming a tail\r\nwhich bears at its tip a poison-fang or sting. This sting is used to\r\nkill prey, insects and other small animals. The tail can be darted\r\nforwards over the body to strike prey which has been previously seized\r\nby the large pincer-like maxillary palpi. Scorpions are common in warm\r\nregions, about twenty species being known in southern North America.\r\nTheir sting though painful is not dangerous to man. The young are born\r\nalive and are carried about by the mother for some time after birth.\r\n\r\nThe mites (figs. 90 and 91) and ticks (fig. 92) are mostly small\r\nobscure animals, which live more or less parasitically. The common red\r\nspider of house-plants as well as the sugar- and cheese-mites, the\r\ndreaded itch-mite and the chigger are familiar examples of these\r\ndegraded arachnids, and the wood-ticks, dog- and chicken-ticks are\r\ncommon examples of the larger bloodsucking forms. The body in both\r\nmites and ticks is very compact, the two body-regions, cephalothorax\r\nand abdomen, being closely fused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Bird mite, species undetermined, from the\r\ngnome-owl, Glaucidium gnomus. (Photo-micrograph by Geo. O. Mitchell.)]\r\n\r\nThe spiders have the abdomen distinctly set off from the\r\ncephalothorax. The eyes (fig. 93) vary in number and arrangement, the\r\nmandibles are large, each being composed of two parts, a basal\r\nhair-covered part, the falx, and a terminal smooth, shining, slender,\r\nsharp-pointed part, the fang, which is movably articulated with the\r\nfalx (fig. 93). In the falx is a poison-sac from which poison flows\r\nthrough the hollow fang and out at its tip. The legs vary in relative\r\nlength in different spiders, and each is made up of seven joints. The\r\nspinnerets (fig. 94), which are situated at the tip of the abdomen,\r\nare six in number (a few spiders have only four), and are like little\r\nshort fingers. They have at their tips many fine little spinning-tubes\r\nfrom each of which a fine silken thread issues when the spider is\r\nspinning. These many fine threads fuse as they issue to form a single\r\nstrong cable or sometimes a flat rather broad band. The spinnerets are\r\nmovable, and by their manipulation the desired kind of line is\r\nproduced. The silk comes from many silk-glands in the abdomen, from\r\neach of which a fine duct runs to a spinning-tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--The dog or wood tick, _Dermacentor americanus_\r\nmale, the most common tick in the Northern States. (After Osborn.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--The eyes and jaws, showing falx and fang of a\r\nspider. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--The six spinnerets (below) of a spider, with\r\none spinneret enlarged (above) to show the spinning \"spools\" or tubes.\r\n(From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nThe spiders may be divided into two groups according to their habits,\r\nviz., the wandering or hunting spiders, which do not spin webs to catch\r\ntheir prey, and the sedentary or web-weaving spiders, which spin snares\r\nto catch their prey. The wandering spiders can spin silk, however, and\r\noften do so to line their burrows, to make nests, or to make egg-sacs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--A long-legged spider, _Tetragnatha_ sp., on\r\nits web. (From life.)]\r\n\r\nThe hairy tarantulas and the trap-door spiders of similar appearance are\r\namong the most interesting of the hunting spiders. They live in\r\nvertical burrows or tunnels in the ground which are lined with silk, and\r\nwhich in the case of the trap-door spider are covered with a door or lid\r\nmade of silk and soil. The top of this door is always covered with soil\r\nor bits of leaves or twigs so that it is nearly indistinguishable from\r\nthe surface of the ground about it. When the nest is in ground covered\r\nwith moss the spider covers the door with moss. The tarantulas hunt at\r\nnight and rest in the burrow in the daytime. They are very large,\r\nsometimes having an expanse of legs of 6 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--A running spider (Lycosidæ). (From life.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--A female running spider (Lycosidæ) carrying its\r\negg-sac about attached to its spinnerets. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nThe common, rather large swift black spiders found under stones and\r\nboards are hunting spiders, belonging to the family Lycosidæ and are\r\ncalled the running spiders (fig. 96). They live in burrows in the\r\nground, coming out to stalk and chase their prey. The eggs are laid in\r\nglobular egg-sacs which are often carried about, attached to the\r\nspinnerets, by the female (fig. 97). The young spiderlings after\r\nhatching, in some species, climb on to the mother's back and are carried\r\nby her for some time. Other kinds of wandering or hunting spiders are\r\nthe crab-spiders (Thomisidæ) (fig. 98), which run sidewise or backward\r\nas well as forward, and the black and red, fierce-eyed stout-bodied\r\nlittle jumping spiders (Attidæ) (fig. 99), which leap on their prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--A crab-spider (Thomisidæ). (From Jenkins and\r\nKellogg.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--A jumping spider (Attidæ). (From Jenkins and\r\nKellogg.)]\r\n\r\nThe sedentary or web-weaving spiders are of various kinds. They may be\r\ngrouped according to their spinning habits into cobweb weavers\r\n(Therididæ), small slim-legged spiders which make the familiar\r\nunsymmetrical cobwebs of houses and outbuildings; funnel-web weavers\r\n(Agalenidæ), larger long-legged spiders of meadow and field which spin\r\na flat or concave horizontal web in the grass with a silken tube\r\nleading down to the ground; the curled-thread weavers (Dictynidæ),\r\nwhich use in addition to the usual lines peculiar broad lines made of\r\nwaved or curled threads in their irregular webs made in fence-corners\r\nand on plants; and finally orb-weavers (Epeiridæ) (fig. 100), the host\r\nof variously colored and patterned stout-bodied garden-spiders which\r\nspin the beautiful symmetrical circular webs familiar to all (fig.\r\n101). If a complete uninjured orb web be examined it will be found to\r\nconsist of a small central hub either open or closed, from which run\r\nradii to the outer edges of the web. Around the hub is an open or free\r\nzone, and farther out a spiral zone, so called because a line running\r\nin close spiral turns fills in the space between the radii. This is\r\nthe real prey-catching part of the snare, and the silken line here is\r\nsticky, while the radii and some other parts of the web are made of\r\nsilk that is not sticky. The web is supported by strong\r\nfoundation-lines, attached to leaves, stems, or whatever is firm in\r\nthe neighborhood of the web. The spider either rests on the web,\r\nusually in the centre, or lies concealed in a nest or tent near at\r\nhand from which a special path-line runs to the centre of the web. The\r\nbuilding of one of these orb webs is a great work, and is done with\r\nextraordinary nicety of manipulation by the use of feet and\r\nspinnerets. For account of web-making, etc., see McCook's \"American\r\nSpiders and their Spinning Work.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--_Argiope_ sp., a large orb-weaver\r\n(Epeiridæ). (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Spider and its web in a rose-bush.\r\n(Photograph from life by Cherry Kearton; from \"Wild Life at Home,\" by\r\npermission of Cassell & Co.).]\r\n\r\nThe habits and instincts of spiders in connection with the care of the\r\nyoung, the building of webs and nests, ballooning by means of silken\r\nlines, the active stalking and catching of prey, etc., are very\r\ninteresting and offer a good field for independent observation and\r\nstudy by the student.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--The triangle spider, _Hyptiotes_ sp.\r\n(California), with its web; the spider rests on the taut guy-line,\r\nwith a loop of the line held between its fore and hind legs; when an\r\ninsect gets into the web the spider loosens the hold of its hind feet\r\non the guy-line, thus allowing the web to spring forward sharply and\r\nfurther entangle the prey. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] There are in many forms a few internal projections from the\r\nexterior cuticle which act as internal skeletal pieces.\r\n\r\n[10] The labrum differs from the other mouth-parts in not being\r\ncomposed of a pair of body appendages; it is simply a fold or flap of\r\nthe skin of the head.\r\n\r\n[11] A Text-book of Zoology, Parker & Haswell, 1897.\r\n\r\n[12] The Cambridge Natural History, vol.

Comstock, 1897.\r\n\r\n[14] It has been shown by experiment that the winged individuals,\r\nwhich are able to leave the old food-plant and scatter over new\r\nplants, do not appear until the food-supply begins to run short. At\r\nthe insectary of Cornell University ninety-four successive generations\r\nof wingless individuals were bred, by taking care to provide a\r\nconstantly abundant supply of food. This experiment was continued for\r\nmore than four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                         MOLLUSCA: THE MOLLUSCS\r\n\r\n                  THE FRESH-WATER MUSSEL (_Unio_ sp.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Structure= (fig. 103).--TECHNICAL NOTE.--The fresh-water or river\r\n    mussel lives commonly in the streams and lakes or ponds in the\r\n    United States. It frequents muddy or sandy bottoms. Specimens can\r\n    often be secured with a long-handled rake from the shore or picked\r\n    up in shallow streams with the hand. If possible to keep the animals\r\n    alive until ready for use, some of their habits may be observed.\r\n    Place them in a tub or trough with water and mud; when they have\r\n    settled themselves put some powdered carmine, starch, or similar\r\n    substance in the water near them, and note the water-currents.\r\n\r\nLiving mussels which have been placed in a dish with mud several\r\ninches deep and covered with water will be seen to travel in a\r\ndefinite direction. The end which is in front is the head end. Note\r\nthe process of thrusting out and retracting the fleshy _foot_ which\r\nextends between the two _valves_ of the _shell_. Note that the two\r\nvalves are held together along the upper, or dorsal, surface by a\r\nhorny structure, the _hinge-ligament_. Note near the hinge-line a\r\nprominence (_umbo_) in each valve from which extends a series of\r\nconcentric lines of growth. The umbo is the oldest part of the valve.\r\nNote at the lower edge of the valves a soft membrane with a fringe\r\nalong its free border. This is the edge of the _mantle-lobes_, flaps\r\nof the body-wall which cover the body and which aid in the functions\r\nof respiration and nutrition.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Specimens which are to be dissected should be\r\n    killed by dropping them for a few seconds into warm water, when\r\n    the muscles will relax enough so that a chip may be thrust between\r\n    the valves. If specimens are to be kept for some time before\r\n    dissecting they should be preserved in alcohol or 4% formalin. In\r\n    a dead specimen carefully remove the left valve. This is\r\n    accomplished by slipping in a thin knife-blade close to the inner\r\n    edge of the left valve and carefully cutting the two large\r\n    adductor muscles which bind the valves together. The dissection\r\n    should be made under water.\r\n\r\nBefore the removal of the valve, as just described, notice a portion\r\nof the mantle adhering to the inner face of the valve, along a line of\r\nattachment indicated by a crease. This is the _pallial line_. After\r\nthe left valve has been removed, the mantle being carefully separated\r\nfrom it, note the large conical projections from the valves, the\r\n_hinge teeth_, which fit into each other. Note the large muscle\r\nimpression just in front of the hinge-teeth; this is the point of\r\nattachment of the _anterior adductor muscle_, while just behind and\r\nadjoining it is the impression of the _anterior retractor muscle_.\r\nNote posterior to the adductor and below the retractor a small\r\nimpression which affords attachment for the _protractor muscles_ of\r\nthe foot. At the other end of the valve, note the large impression of\r\nthe _posterior adductor muscle_ with the impression of the small\r\n_posterior retractor muscle_ just above it.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Lift back the left mantle-lobe, thus exposing the\r\n    body parts underneath.\r\n\r\nNote the projecting muscular foot, the movements of which are governed\r\nby the retractor and protractor muscles attached to the impressions\r\njust mentioned. Note a pair of flattened plate-like structures\r\ncomposed of thin, ribbed, membranous folds. These are the _gills_.\r\nNote just beneath the anterior adductor muscle a small opening leading\r\ninto the soft _visceral mass_ of the body. This is the _mouth_. Note\r\nnear the mouth two pairs of plate-like structures much smaller than\r\nthe gills. These are the _labial palpi_, and it is by their action\r\nthat food-particles which have been brought in with the water are\r\nconveyed to the mouth. Note at the posterior part of each mantle-lobe\r\na fringed portion which, together with a corresponding part on the\r\nother side, forms the _inhalant siphon_. The cilia of the fringes\r\ncarry water and food-particles into the space enclosed by the\r\nmantle-lobes; this space is the _mantle-cavity_. After the food has\r\nbeen taken out and the water has passed through the finely striated\r\ngills it is collected in a common cavity which extends above the two\r\nsets of gills on each side. This space is called the _supra-branchial\r\ncavity_. This cavity is continuous posteriorly with a space between\r\nthe right and left mantle-lobes, which is connected with the exterior\r\nby an opening above the inhalant siphon called the _exhalant siphon_.\r\nThe function of the gills is partly to produce currents of water\r\ncarrying the food to the mouth, and partly respiratory. The mantle is\r\nan important organ of respiration.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing showing the organs described.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Carefully cut away the mantle and gills from the\r\n    left side, and also the labial palpi, being careful not to disturb\r\n    the visceral mass.\r\n\r\nNote two openings along the line where the gills and foot come together.\r\nThe uppermost is the opening of the ureter giving exit to the excretion\r\nfrom the kidneys; the lower is the opening of the duct from the\r\nreproductive organs and is called the _genital aperture_. The products\r\nfrom both of these organs are carried out through the exhalant siphon.\r\n\r\nNote that the mouth leads by a short tube (_œsophagus_ or _gullet_)\r\ninto a large cavity, the _stomach_, which is surrounded by a greenish\r\nmass, the _digestive gland_.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Carefully cut the delicate covering of the dorsal\r\n    portion of the visceral mass and expose a cavity.\r\n\r\nThe cavity thus exposed is the _pericardium_. Note within the\r\npericardium a long tube extending through it. This is a portion of the\r\nalimentary canal, the _rectum_, which opens posteriorly through the\r\n_anus_ into the _supra-branchial chamber_. Note a muscular sac about\r\nthe rectum midway of its course through the pericardium. This is the\r\nunpaired _ventricle_ of the _heart_. Attached to each side of the\r\nventricle are thin-walled sacs, the _right_ and _left auricles_, which\r\nare entered by fine blood-vessels, the _efferent branchial veins_,\r\nfrom the right and left gills. The blood brought through these\r\nblood-vessels from the gills flows into the auricles and from them\r\ninto the unpaired muscular ventricle, from which it is forced\r\nanteriorly and posteriorly through two main arteries, the _anterior_\r\nand _posterior aortas_, to all parts of the body. After bathing the\r\nbody-tissues the blood is collected into a median longitudinal vein\r\nbeneath the pericardium called the _vena cava_. From the vena cava the\r\nblood passes through the kidneys and gills to be returned at last to\r\nthe heart. The mantle acts as an organ for the aeration of the blood,\r\nand the blood it receives or at least part of it passes directly back\r\nto the heart without passing through the kidneys and gills.\r\n\r\nNote the delicate membranous dark-colored sac on the floor of the\r\npericardium, the _kidneys_ or _nephridia_. These are paired structures\r\nwhich appear as two U-shaped tubes lying side by side. Each consists\r\nof a lower portion with thick folded walls, the kidney proper, and an\r\nupper thin-walled portion, the _ureter_. The kidneys open internally\r\nthrough a pair of _reno-pericardial_ openings into the pericardium,\r\nwhile the ureters communicate with the mantle-cavity by an opening on\r\nthe side of the body beneath the gills as already mentioned. The\r\nkidneys are profusely supplied with fine blood-vessels and carry off\r\nthe waste matter from the blood.\r\n\r\nBeneath the posterior adductor muscles note a small white\r\nspider-shaped body, the more or less united _visceral ganglia_ of the\r\nnervous system. Posteriorly these ganglia give off nerves to the\r\nmantle and gills, while anteriorly there proceed two nerves, the\r\n_cerebro-visceral connectives_, running forward, one on either side of\r\nthe foot close to the visceral mass, to the _cerebro-pleural ganglia_,\r\npaired ganglia lying near the mouth. A delicate commissure running\r\nover the gullet connects these ganglia.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Cut away the skin and outer muscular layer from\r\n    the left side of the foot.\r\n\r\nNote the large stomach-cavity, surrounded by the digestive gland. Trace\r\nthe convolutions of the alimentary canal through the foot to the anal\r\nexit. Note in the anterior portion of the foot a fused pair of ganglia\r\nsimilar to the visceral ganglia. These are the _pedal ganglia_, which\r\nare connected by a pair of delicate commissures, the _cerebro-pedal\r\nconnectives_, with the cerebro-pleural ganglia. Note the glandular\r\ntissue which fills the cavity of the foot and surrounds the loops of the\r\nalimentary canal. This is the reproductive organ, which has its exit\r\nbeneath the gills on each side of the foot. The sexes of the mussel are\r\nseparate, but the reproductive organs are very similar.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The eggs (ova) of the female pass first\r\ninto the supra-branchial chamber, whence, after being fertilized, they\r\ndrop into the outer pair of gill-chambers. These outer gills serve as\r\nbrood-pouches, and here it is that the embryonic stages are passed\r\nthrough. The embryo when ready to issue has a soft body enclosed in\r\ntwo triangular valves. At this stage it is called a _glochidium_. The\r\nglochidium on being discharged through the exhalant siphon of the\r\nparent falls to the bottom, where it remains for a time, when it\r\nattaches itself to some fish by the lower hook-like projections of\r\nthe valves and leads a truly parasitic life for two months, after\r\nwhich it undergoes a metamorphosis and falls to the bottom again,\r\nthere to begin an independent existence. Mussels often congregate in\r\nfavorite mud or sand banks. Their food consists primarily of small\r\norganisms, both plants and animals, which are taken from the water\r\nentering the mantle-cavity. Mussels move about slowly over the muddy\r\nbottom of the stream by means of the muscular foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OTHER MOLLUSCS.\r\n\r\nThe branch Mollusca includes the fresh-water mussels, the clams,\r\noysters, snails, and slugs, the cuttlefishes, and all that host of\r\nanimals we call \"shells\" or shell-fish, which we know familiarly only\r\nby the shell which they make, live in, and leave at death to tell the\r\ntale of their existence. Not all the molluscs, however, form shells,\r\nthat is, external shells which serve as houses. The familiar slugs do\r\nnot, nor do a number of ocean forms called nudibranchs, which are\r\nsomewhat like the land-slugs, only much prettier and more attractive.\r\nAll the cuttlefishes and octopi are also without the hard calcareous\r\nshell. But most of the molluscs are shell-bearing animals. The shell\r\nmay be bivalved, as in the mussel and clam, or univalved, that is,\r\ncomposed of a single piece which may be spirally twisted, as with the\r\nsnail, or otherwise curiously shaped. The variety in the form, colors,\r\nand markings of the shells indicates the great diversity among\r\nmolluscs. Molluscs live on land, in fresh water and in the ocean. No\r\ndepths of the ocean abysses are too great for the octopi, no coast but\r\nhas its many shells, hardly a pond or stream is without its mussels\r\nand pond-snails, and in all regions the land-snails and slugs abound.\r\n\r\n=Body form and structure.=--The molluscs are not to be mistaken for\r\nany other of the lower animals; they have a structure peculiarly their\r\nown. In them the body is not articulated or segmented as with the\r\nworms and arthropods, nor radiate as in the echinoderms, nor\r\nplant-like as with the sponges and polyps. (Where the typical\r\nmolluscan body is well developed it is composed of four principal\r\nparts: a head, with the mouth, feelers, eyes, and other organs of\r\nspecial sense; a trunk containing the internal organs; a foot which is\r\na thick muscular mass not at all foot- or leg-like in shape, but which\r\nis the organ of locomotion by means of which the mollusc crawls; and a\r\nmantle which is a fold of the skin enclosing most of the body and\r\nwhich produces the shell. Such a typical molluscan body is possessed\r\nby most of the snails. But in most of the other molluscs one or more\r\nof these four body-regions are so fused with some other region as to\r\nbe indistinguishable. In the mussels and clams the head is not at all\r\nset off from the rest of the body, the cuttlefishes and octopi have no\r\nfoot, the slugs have no shell. In the case of some of the molluscs\r\nwithout external shell there are inside the body the rudiments or\r\nvestiges of a shell.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the internal organs we note the constant presence of\r\nthree pairs of ganglia, viz., the brain, lying above the pharynx,\r\nwhich sends nerves to the feelers, eyes, and auditory organs; the\r\npedal ganglion, which sends nerves to the foot, and the visceral\r\nganglion, which sends nerves to the viscera. This is a condition of\r\nthe nervous system characteristic of all molluscs. The heart is a\r\nwell-developed pulsating sac in the upper part of the body composed of\r\neither two or three chambers, and there is a well-defined closed\r\nsystem of arteries and veins, specially complete in the cuttlefishes\r\nand octopi. This highly developed condition of the circulatory system\r\nalso distinguishes the molluscs from the other invertebrates.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--Reproduction among the molluscs is always sexual.\r\nMultiplication by budding or by the parthenogenetic production of eggs\r\nis not known to occur. The eggs are usually laid in a mass held together\r\nby a gelatinous substance. In most species the young mollusc on hatching\r\nfrom the egg does not resemble its parent, but is a free-swimming larva\r\ncalled a _veliger_. It is provided with cilia for organs of locomotion.\r\nIt must undergo a radical change in order to reach the adult stage. Thus\r\nmetamorphosis occurs in this branch as well as among the Arthropods and\r\nEchinoderms. In the development of some molluscs, however, there is\r\nlittle or no metamorphosis, the young being hatched in a condition much\r\nresembling, except in size, the parent.\r\n\r\nSome of the special characteristics of structure, life-history, and\r\nhabits of the molluscs will be noted in our consideration of the\r\nvarious kinds.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The branch Mollusca is divided into five classes,\r\nthree of which include the more familiar kinds. These three classes\r\nare the Pelecypoda, including the mussels, cockles, clams, scallops,\r\noysters, etc., molluscs with a shell composed of two pieces, one on\r\neach side of the body and hinged together; the Gastropoda, including\r\nthe snails, slugs, periwinkles, whelks, and a host of other univalved\r\nshell-fish, that is, molluscs which have a shell composed of a single\r\npiece; and the Cephalopoda, including the squids, cuttlefishes,\r\noctopi, and the pearly nautilus.\r\n\r\n    =Clams, scallops, and oysters (Pelecypoda).=--TECHNICAL\r\n    NOTE.--Shells of scallops, oysters, and sea-mussels should be had\r\n    for examination; also specimens of _Teredo_ or _Pholas_ in alcohol\r\n    or formalin, and pieces of pile bored by _Teredo_. Make drawings\r\n    of various bivalve shells, and of _Teredo_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Dissection of fresh-water mussel, _Unio_ sp.]\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water mussel which we have studied is an example of the\r\nbivalve molluscs. The members of this class show a range in size\r\nfrom the little fresh-water _Cyclas_ about 1 cm. long to the giant\r\nclam of the Indian and Pacific islands \"which is sometimes 60 cm. (2\r\nfeet) in length and 500 pounds in weight.\" They show also some variety\r\nin the form and appearance of the shell, but not anything like the\r\ndegree of variety shown by the shells of the Gastropods.\r\n\r\nThe edible clams are of several different species. The hard-shell clam\r\n(_Venus mercenaria_), or \"quohog\" as it is often called, is found\r\nalong the Atlantic coast from Texas to Cape Cod. It is \"common on\r\nsandy shores, living chiefly on the sandy and muddy plots, just beyond\r\nlow-water mark.... It also inhabits estuaries, where it most abounds.\r\nIt burrows a short distance below the surface, but is frequently found\r\ncrawling at the surface with the shell partly exposed.\" The shells of\r\nthis edible clam are white. The soft-shell clam (_Mya arenaria_), \"the\r\nclam _par excellence_, which figures so largely in the celebrated New\r\nEngland clam-bake, is found in all the northern seas of the world....\r\nAll along the coasts of the eastern States, every sandy shore, every\r\nmud flat, is full of them, and from every village and hamlet the\r\nclam-digger goes forth at low tide to dig these esculent bivalves. The\r\nclams live in deep burrows in the firm mud or sand, the shells\r\nsometimes being a foot or fifteen inches beneath the surface. When the\r\nflats are covered with water his clamship extends his long siphons up\r\nthrough the burrow to the surface of the sand, and through one of\r\nthese tubes the water and its myriads of animalcules is drawn down\r\ninto the shell, furnishing the gills with oxygen and the mouth with\r\nfood, and then the water charged with carbonic acid and fæcal refuse\r\nis forced out of the other siphon. When the tide ebbs the siphons are\r\nclosed and partly withdrawn.\" Ocean clams and mussels have furnished\r\nfood for man for ages, and along coasts are found here and there\r\ngreat mounds made of heaps of clam-shells which have become covered\r\nover with soil and vegetation. Such mounds are the old feasting-places\r\nof the early coast inhabitants, and the archæologist often finds in\r\nthese \"kitchen-middens,\" as they are called, various relics of the\r\nearly natives of the continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--A group of marine Pacific Coast molluscs; in\r\nupper left-hand corner, _Purpura saxicola_; next to the right,\r\n_Littorina scutulata_; farthest to right, limpets, _Acmara spectrum_;\r\nleft-hand lower corner, _Mytilus californianus_; in right-hand lower\r\ncorner the black shells just above the large clam-shell, _Chlorostomum\r\nfunebrale_. (From living specimens in a tide pool in the Bay of\r\nMonterey, California.)]\r\n\r\nEven more widely known that the clams are the oysters (_Ostrea\r\nvirginiana_), also members of this class of molluscs. The oyster is\r\ncarefully cultivated by man in many countries. It has its two shells\r\nor two shell-halves dissimilar, one valve being hollowed out to\r\nreceive the body, while the other is nearly flat. The oyster is\r\nattached to the sea-bottom by the outside of the hollowed-out valve.\r\nWhen first hatched the young oyster swims freely by means of its\r\ncilia; after a few days it attaches itself to some solid object and\r\ngrows truly oyster-like. Much care has to be taken in cultivating\r\noysters to furnish proper conditions for growth and development. The\r\nyoung oysters when first attached are called \"spat\"; when a little\r\nolder this \"spat,\" now called \"seed,\" may be transplanted to new beds,\r\nwhich are stocked in this way. In fact some beds have constantly to be\r\nthus restocked, the young oysters produced on them not finding good\r\nplaces to attach themselves, and so swimming away. Sometimes pieces of\r\nslate, pottery, etc., are strewed about the oyster-beds to serve as\r\n\"collectors,\" that is, as places for the attachment of the young\r\noysters. The extent of the acreage of the American oyster-beds is\r\nlarger than that of any other country. \"The Baltimore oyster-beds on\r\nthe Chesapeake River and its tributaries cover 3,000 acres, and\r\nproduce an annual crop of 25,000,000 bushels.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--_Dactylus_ sp., a mollusc, excavating granite.\r\n(Photograph by C. H. Snow; permission of Amer. Soc. Civil Engineers.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--_Pholas_ sp., a mollusc, burrowing in\r\nsandstone. (Photograph by C. H. Snow; permission of Amer. Soc. Civil\r\nEngineers.)]\r\n\r\nThe \"pearl-oyster\" is not a true oyster, that is, not a member of the\r\nfamily to which the edible oysters belong, but it is a member of the\r\nsame class, that is, it is a bivalve mollusc. Pearls are obtained from\r\na number of different \"pearl-oysters,\" but the finest pearls and\r\nmother-of-pearl come from the tropical species _Meleagrina\r\nmargaritifera_. This pearl-oyster \"has an extensive distribution,\r\nbeing found in Madagascar, the Persian Gulf, Ceylon, Australia,\r\nPhilippine Islands, South Sea Islands, Panama, West Indies, etc.\"\r\nMother-of-pearl is simply the inner lining of the shell, which is\r\ncomposed of numerous thin layers of carbonate of lime so arranged that\r\nthe edges of the successive layers produce many fine striæ very close\r\ntogether. The beautiful iridescence of this inner shell-lining is\r\ncaused by the complicated diffraction and reflection (interference\r\neffects) of the light by the fine striæ and the translucent superposed\r\nthin plates of shell material. Pearls are simply isolated deposits of\r\nshell material usually around some particle of foreign substance which\r\nhas found lodging in the mantle-cavity. Sometimes small objects are\r\npurposely introduced into the shell in order to stimulate the\r\nformation of pearls. The pearl-fishers go out in boats and dive to the\r\nbottom, filling baskets with pearl-oysters. These are piled up in a\r\nbin and left to die and decompose. \"When the flesh is pretty\r\nthoroughly disintegrated, it is washed away with water, great care\r\nbeing taken that none of the pearls loose in the flesh are lost. When\r\nthe washing is concluded the shells themselves are examined for pearls\r\nwhich may be attached to the interior of the valves.\" The principal\r\npearl-fishery is that on the coast of Ceylon; pearl-fishing has been\r\ncarried on here for over 2000 years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--_Martesia xylophaga_, a Pholad, in Panama\r\nmahogany. (Photograph by C. H. Snow; permission of Amer. Soc. Civil\r\nEngineers.)]\r\n\r\nThe ship-worm (_Teredo_) is an interesting member of this class of\r\nbivalve molluscs, because of its unusual habits, and strangely\r\nmodified body form. The teredo is long and worm-like in general\r\nappearance, with a small bivalve shell at one end and two elongated\r\nsiphons at the other. The young teredo is a free-swimming ciliated\r\nembryo like the young of the other bivalve molluscs, but it soon\r\nsettles on a piece of submerged wood, usually the pile of a wharf, or\r\nthe bottom of a ship, and burrows into this wood. As it grows it\r\nenlarges and deepens its tube-like burrow, and lines it with a\r\ncalcareous deposit. The burrow may be a foot long or longer, and when\r\nthousands of teredos attack a pile or the bottom of a ship, the wood\r\nsoon becomes riddled with holes. These boring molluscs do great\r\ndamage to wharves and ships. In Holland where they were first\r\ndiscovered they caused such injuries to the piles and other submerged\r\nwood which supported the dikes and sea-walls that they seriously\r\nthreatened the safety of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--The giant yellow slug of California,\r\n_Ariolimax californica_. This slug reaches a length when outstretched\r\nof 12 inches. (From living specimen.)]\r\n\r\n    =Snails, slugs, nudibranchs and \"sea-shells\"\r\n    (Gastropoda).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Pond-snails can be readily found\r\n    clinging to submerged stems, leaves, or pieces of wood in almost any\r\n    pond. Collect some and carry alive, in a jar of water, to the\r\n    schoolroom. Observe the habits of these live snails in the school\r\n    aquarium. Note the movements, the coming to the surface to breathe,\r\n    the eating (by scraping the surface of the leaves with the \"radula\"\r\n    or tongue; provide fresh bits of cabbage or lettuce-leaves), the use\r\n    of the feelers. Make drawings illustrating these habits. Examine the\r\n    shell; note that it is univalved, that is, composed of one piece. Do\r\n    the whorls of all the shells turn the same way? Make a drawing of\r\n    the shell, naming such parts as the apex, spire (all the whorls\r\n    taken together), the aperture, the columella (the axis of the\r\n    spire), the lip (outer edge of the aperture), the lines of growth\r\n    (parallel to the tip), the suture (the spiral groove on the\r\n    outside). Examine the snail; note the character of the foot; note\r\n    the protrusible tentacles or feelers, the eyes (dark spots at bases\r\n    of the tentacles), the mouth, the respiratory opening (on right side\r\n    of body in the edge of the mantle which protrudes beneath the lip\r\n    when the snail's body is extended), the radula or ribbon-like tongue\r\n    with fine teeth. Compare with the body of the mussel.\r\n\r\n    Slugs may be found during the day concealed under boards or\r\n    elsewhere; they are nocturnal in habit. If specimens can be\r\n    obtained, compare with the pond-snails, noting the absence of a\r\n    shell, and the fleshy mantle on the dorsal surface near the head;\r\n    note the presence of two pairs of tentacles (the eyes being at the\r\n    tips of the second or hinder pair), and the respiratory pore. Note\r\n    the streak of mucus left by the slugs in crawling about.\r\n\r\n    Some sea-shells can be got from private collections of \"curios\" to\r\n    illustrate the variety of form of the univalve shells.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one-half of all the known species of molluscs are snails and\r\nslugs (fig. 108). Snails are either aquatic or terrestrial in habit,\r\nbut in either case they (the true pulmonate snails) breathe not by\r\nmeans of gills, as do most of the other molluscs, but by means of a\r\nso-called \"lung.\" This lung is a sac with an external opening on the\r\nright side of the body and with its inner surface richly furnished\r\nwith fine blood-vessels. The exchange of gases between the blood and\r\nthe outer air takes place through the thin walls of the blood-vessels.\r\nMost snails which live in the water, as the pond-snails and the\r\nriver-snails, have to come occasionally to the surface to breathe.\r\nThese fresh-water and land-molluscs which possess a lung-sac instead\r\nof gills constitute the order Pulmonata. The pulmonate pond- and\r\nland-snails and slugs are vegetable feeders and where they occur in\r\nlarge numbers do much injury to vegetation. While the common\r\npond-snails have but one pair of feelers, at the base of which are\r\nfound the eyes, most of the land-snails and slugs have two pairs of\r\n\"horns,\" the eyes being on the tips of the second pair. The lung-sac,\r\nbesides serving as a breathing organ, also enables the snail to rise\r\nor sink according as the animal varies the size of the sac and\r\nconsequently the amount of air in it. All the Pulmonata are\r\nhermaphroditic, each individual producing both sperm- and egg-cells.\r\nThe eggs of the pond-snail \"are laid in gelatinous transparent\r\ncapsules, half an inch to an inch in length, flattened and linear or\r\noblong in outline. After a few snails have been kept a short time in a\r\nsmall vessel of water with their appropriate food, these egg-capsules\r\nmay be looked for on the bottom and sides of the vessel or closely\r\nadherent to the stems or leaves of plants placed in the water. They\r\nare so transparent as to be easily overlooked.\" Young snails may be\r\nreared from these eggs.\r\n\r\nThere are other snails common in ponds, also called, like the\r\npulmonate forms, pond-snails, which have gills and no lung-sac. These\r\npond-snails belong to a different order of molluscs, and live on the\r\nbottom of the pond, crawling about in the soft mud and feeding on\r\nanimal instead of vegetable food.\r\n\r\nThe shells of the various kinds of snails vary much. In many of the\r\nland-snails the spiral is not spire-shaped or conical, but is flat. In\r\nsome the whorls of the spiral run from left to right (dextral) when\r\nthe shell is looked at with apex held toward one, while in others the\r\nwhorls run from right to left (sinistral).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Three Pacific Coast nudibranchs; _Doris\r\ntuberculata_ (in lower left-hand corner), _Echinodoris_ sp. (upper\r\none), and _Triopha modesta_ (at right). (From living specimens in a\r\ntide-pool on the Bay of Monterey, California.)]\r\n\r\nOf the hosts of marine Gastropods we can notice only a few kinds. The\r\nnudibranchs (fig. 109) are a group of beautiful forms in which the\r\nshell is wholly wanting and the mantle is usually absent. The gills\r\nare thus exposed and are usually in the shape of delicate freely\r\nprojecting tufts arranged in rows along the back. The body is often\r\nstrikingly and variedly colored. These soft, naked \"sea-slugs\" live\r\nnear the shore, creeping about among the rocks and seaweeds. About a\r\nthousand species of nudibranchs are known.\r\n\r\nAmong the shell-forming marine Gastropods there is great variety in\r\nthe size and shape and coloring of the shells. Many are beautifully\r\ncolored and patterned; others are oddly and fantastically shaped. The\r\ncowries, or porcelain shells, familiar in collections of ocean\r\ncuriosities, have a large body whorl and a very short flat spire, and\r\nthe brightly colored shell looks as if enamelled. Some of the coast\r\ntribes of Africa once used, and perhaps still use to some extent,\r\ncowries as money. The limpets (fig. 104) are among the most abundant\r\nof the seashore molluscs, their low, broadly conical shells being\r\nplentifully scattered over the rocks between tide-lines. The\r\n\"oyster-drills\" are Gastropods with odd spiny shells which do much\r\nharm in oyster-beds by settling down on the oysters, boring holes\r\nthrough the shells and eating the soft parts within. The\r\nhelmet-shells, from which shell cameos are cut, are composed of layers\r\nof shell material of different colors. Among the specially beautiful\r\nshells are the cone-shells, the olive-shells, the ivory-shells, etc.\r\n\r\n    =Squids, cuttlefishes, and octopi (Cephalopoda).=--TECHNICAL\r\n    NOTE.--Small squids preserved in alcohol or formalin can be had of\r\n    all dealers in biological supplies (see p. 453), and specimens\r\n    should be examined.\r\n\r\nThe squids (fig. 110), cuttlefishes, octopi or \"devil-fishes,\" and the\r\nthree living species of _Nautilus_ constituting the class Cephalopoda\r\nare very different from the other molluscs in appearance, and are in\r\nfact different in important structural characters. They can move\r\nswiftly, have strangely modified organs of prehension, strong biting\r\nmouth-parts, and eyes of very complex organization. They are the most\r\nhighly organized molluscan forms, and their predaceous habits and the\r\ngreat size to which some of them attain have given them distinction\r\namong the fierce and dangerous creatures of the sea. They are all\r\nstrictly marine in habitat, and are all carnivorous. Most of them have\r\nno shell, or where the shell is present it is internal in all but a very\r\nfew forms. The tentacle-like arms or feet surrounding the mouth which\r\noccur in all the Cephalopods are provided with sucking organs or\r\nsuckers, in some cases with a horny toothed rim. These long, powerful,\r\ngrasping, tentacular feet, with the suckers and five hooks, are very\r\neffective means of securing prey, and the pair of strong, sharp, cutting\r\nmandibles or beaks are equally effective in tearing to pieces. The eyes\r\nof the Cephalopods are almost as highly developed as those of the\r\nvertebrates. They are unusually large and staring, and add much to the\r\nterrifying appearance of the \"devil-fishes.\" Cephalopods have the power\r\nof quickly changing color, because of the presence in the skin of many\r\npigment-cells which can expand so as nearly to touch each other, thus\r\nproducing a uniform tint over the whole body, or which can contract so\r\nas to destroy this uniformity of color. There are several sets of these\r\ncolor-carrying cells or chromatophores, each set of a color different\r\nfrom the others. The purpose of this change of color is protective, the\r\nanimal being thereby able to make its color so harmonize with that of\r\nits immediate surroundings as to become indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nThere are two principal groups of Cephalopods, viz., the Decapods and\r\nthe Octopods. The Decapods, as their name indicates, have ten feet or\r\narms surrounding the mouth, and in them the body is usually elongate,\r\ncontaining a horny \"pen\" or calcareous \"bone.\" This group includes the\r\ncuttlefishes or sepias, from which are obtained sepia ink and the\r\ncuttlefish bone used to feed canary birds. The ink is a secretion\r\nwhich the cuttlefish discharges when attacked to create a cloud in the\r\nwater and thus escape unperceived. The squids (_Loligo_) commonly used\r\nas bait by fishermen belong to the Decapoda. The two extra feet or\r\narms which the Decapods have in addition to the eight possessed by the\r\nOctopods, differ from the others in being longer and slenderer and\r\nhaving suckers only on the distal extremities which are expanded into\r\n\"clubs\" (fig. 110).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--The giant squid, _Ommatostrephes californica_.\r\n(From specimen with body (exclusive of tentacles) four feet long, thrown\r\nby waves on shore of the Bay of Monterey, California.)]\r\n\r\nThe Octopods have a short, sac-like, sub-spherical body and neither\r\nexternal nor internal shell. To this group belong the famous\r\ndevil-fishes (_Octopus_), whose strange and terrifying appearance\r\ncombined with their frequently great size has furnished the basis for\r\nmany a weird tale of the sea. _Octopi_ have been killed having\r\ntentacles more than 30 feet in length. The largest members of the\r\nclass, however, are probably the giant squids (belonging to the\r\nDecapoda) specimens of which have been captured with a body-length of\r\ntwenty feet, and arms thirty-five feet long.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful paper sailor or argonaut (_Argonauta argo_), which\r\nsecretes a thin shell (not homologous with the shell of the other\r\nmolluscs) to protect her eggs, is a member of the Octopod group. In\r\nfine weather the argonauts sail in fleets on the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe pearly nautilus (_Nautilus pompilius_) is a Cephalopod with four\r\ngills instead of two, as with the Decapoda and Octopoda, and is the\r\nonly existing member of what was in the earlier times of the earth's\r\nhistory a large group of animals. The nautili live in rather shallow\r\nwater usually creeping over the bottom feeding on small marine\r\nanimals. They make a many-chambered spiral shell with its inner\r\nsurface lined with beautiful pearly nacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                   BRANCH CHORDATA: THE VERTEBRATES,\r\n                            ASCIDIANS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe branch Chordata includes all the backboned animals or vertebrates,\r\ncomprising the fishes, salamanders, frogs and toads, lizards,\r\ncrocodiles, turtles and snakes, birds, and all the quadrupeds or\r\nmammals, and includes also a few small unfamiliar ocean animals which\r\ndo not look at all like the backboned animals, but which agree with\r\nthem in possessing a peculiar structure called the notochord. This\r\nnotochord consists of a series or cord of cells extending\r\nlongitudinally through the body from head to tail, above the\r\nalimentary canal and below the spinal nerve-cord. In all the\r\nvertebrates excepting a few low forms, the notochord while present in\r\nthe young, is replaced in the adult by a segmented bony or\r\ncartilaginous axis, the spinal or vertebral column. But in the\r\nascidians or sea-squirts (called also tunicates) it persists\r\nthroughout life. In addition to this characteristic notochord, nearly\r\nall the Chordata are marked by the presence, either in embryonic or\r\nlarval stages only, or else persisting throughout life, of a number of\r\nslits or clefts in the walls of the pharynx which serve for breathing,\r\nand which are called gill-slits.\r\n\r\n=Structure of the vertebrates.=--As the backboned or vertebrate\r\nanimals make up almost the whole of the branch Chordata, and as the\r\nfew other chordates are animals the special structures of which we\r\nshall not undertake to study in this book, we may note here some of\r\nthe other more obvious structural characteristics of the true\r\nvertebrates. The possession of a backbone or bony (sometimes\r\ncartilaginous) spinal column is the characteristic by which we\r\ndistinguish them from the invertebrate or backboneless animals.\r\nFurthermore, all of the vertebrates possess an internal skeleton which\r\nis in most cases composed of bone, and is firm and strong. In some of\r\nthe lower fishes, as the sharks and sturgeons, the skeleton is made up\r\nof cartilage, tough but not hard. The vertebrate skeleton consists\r\ntypically of an axial portion comprising the spinal column and head,\r\nand of two pairs of appendages or limbs, variously developed as fins,\r\nwings, legs and arms. In some vertebrates these limbs are represented\r\nby mere rudiments, and in the lowest fish-like forms, the lancelets\r\nand lampreys, there is not the slightest trace of limbs. A part of the\r\ncentral nervous system, the spinal cord, runs longitudinally through\r\nthe body on the dorsal side of the alimentary canal; the circulatory\r\nsystem is closed, the blood being always confined in the heart and in\r\nvessels called arteries, veins, and capillaries, and the blood is red\r\nin color owing to the presence of numerous red corpuscles or\r\nblood-cells. The nervous system is highly developed, with a large\r\nbrain in all the typical forms, and with complex and usually highly\r\nefficient special sense-organs. Respiration is carried on by means of\r\nexternal gills, or by internal lungs which communicate with the\r\noutside through the mouth and nostrils. To the lungs and gills the\r\nblood is brought to be \"purified,\" i.e., to give up its carbonic-acid\r\ngas and to take up oxygen.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The Chordata are variously divided by zoologists\r\ninto eight or ten classes, of which (in the eight-class system) the\r\nfive classes[15] Pisces (fishes), Batrachia (batrachians), Reptilia\r\n(reptiles), Aves (birds), and Mammalia (mammals), belong to the true\r\nvertebrates. These classes will be considered in the five following\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nThe remaining three classes include a number of strange marine forms\r\nwhich until recent years were considered as worms, but which are now\r\nknown to be the nearest living allies of the earliest or primitive\r\nvertebrates. The relationship of these forms to early types is\r\nmanifest, not in the appearance or structure of the adult stage, but\r\nonly during embryonic or larval stages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--An ascidian or sea-squirt from the coast of\r\nCalifornia. (After Jordan and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\n=The ascidians.=--The sea-squirts, or Ascidians, common on the seashore,\r\ncompose one class of these primitive chordate animals. They possess a\r\nsimple, sac-like body (fig. 111), fastened to the rocks by one end, the\r\nother being provided with two openings, one for the ingress and the\r\nother for the exit of water, a strong current of which flows constantly\r\nthrough the body. By means of this current the ascidian obtains food.\r\nUsually sea-squirts live together in large colonies, and in some cases a\r\nnumber of individuals enclose themselves in a common gelatinous mass,\r\nforming what is called a compound ascidian.\r\n\r\nThe ascidian when born is a tiny, free-swimming, tadpole-like creature\r\nwith a slender finned tail. It swims about freely for only a few\r\nhours, however, soon attaching itself to a rock, and in its further\r\ndevelopment becoming degenerate. It loses its tail and with it the\r\nshort notochord possessed by the larva; the eye and the auditory organ\r\nare lost, and the nervous system and alimentary canal become much\r\nreduced and simplified. Sea-squirts in their adult stage are very\r\nsimple degenerate animals, with low functional development, yet their\r\nembryonic and larval conditions show a considerable degree of\r\nstructural specialization, and the presence of the notochord in these\r\nearly stages reveals their affinity with the backboned animals.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[15] The animals included by some zoologists in the single class\r\nPisces, are held by other zoologists to constitute three distinct\r\nclasses, thus making a subdivision of the branch into ten classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n              BRANCH CHORDATA (_Continued_): CLASS PISCES\r\n                              (THE FISHES)\r\n\r\n          THE GOLDEN SUNFISH OR PUMPKIN SEED (_Apomotis_ sp.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The species of sunfish named, or some closely\r\n    related species, can be obtained in any brook or stream in the\r\n    United States. _Gibbosus_ lives in all streams north of Dubuque,\r\n    Chicago, Pittsburg, and along the eastern coast north of\r\n    Charleston. Closely allied species live in all the other parts of\r\n    the country except in the higher Rocky Mountains west of Bismarck,\r\n    Pueblo, and Santa Fe. One species is found in the streams of\r\n    California, but none occurs in Washington or Oregon. In the few\r\n    places where a sunfish cannot be had, any species of bass or perch\r\n    may be used. Sunfish live in ponds and sluggish streams in deep\r\n    holes under a log or at the foot of a stump. They take eagerly a\r\n    hook baited with a worm, or they may be caught in nets. When\r\n    sunfish cannot be kept fresh for study in class, specimens may be\r\n    preserved in alcohol or 4% formalin. But if possible to keep some\r\n    alive for a time in a jar or tub with plenty of fresh water, the\r\n    colors of the living fish, together with its manner of swimming\r\n    and mode of breathing, can be observed.\r\n\r\n=External structure=[16] (fig. 112).--Examine the general\r\nconfiguration and make-up of the body. Note the deep, laterally\r\nflattened _trunk_ and paddle-like _tail_. The _head_ is closely fitted\r\nto the trunk without any neck. Note that the body is thickly covered\r\nwith firm, hard _scales_, arranged like the shingles on a roof. Remove\r\none of these scales and examine it under a hand lens. What sort of an\r\nedge has it? Such a scale is said to be _ctenoid_.\r\n\r\nThe body of the sunfish terminates behind in the _caudal fin_, a\r\nseries of cartilaginous rays connected by thin skin and attached to a\r\nbony plate at the end of the backbone. Along the median dorsal line\r\nwill be noted another fin composed anteriorly of spines and\r\nposteriorly of soft rays jointed and branched. This is the _dorsal\r\nfin_. How many spines has it? Anterior to the caudal fin on the\r\nventral surface is a median unpaired _anal fin_. How many spines has\r\nit? Anterior to the anal fin are the _ventral fins_, while on the\r\nsides of the body back of the head in a line with the mouth are found\r\nthe _pectoral fins_. The ventral fins, attached to a rudimentary\r\npelvis, correspond to the hind legs of the other vertebrates. The\r\npectoral fins, attached to the shoulder girdle, correspond to the\r\narms. In front of the anal fin note a small pit-like opening, the\r\nopening from the kidneys and reproductive organs, and just anterior to\r\nthis a large aperture, the _anus_. At the anterior end of the head\r\nnote the broad _mouth_, surrounded by a complicated system of bones.\r\nNote the large _eyes_ surrounded by a series of small bones, the\r\n_orbital chain_. Just anterior to the eyes are two pairs of openings,\r\none pair of each side opening into a closed sac. What are these\r\nopenings? Note the presence of various bones on the side of the head,\r\neach covered with a thin layer of skin. These are _membrane bones_,\r\ncharacteristic of fishes. Are there any external ears in the fish?\r\nExamine the inside of the mouth. Is there a _tongue_? If so, of what\r\ncharacter? Are there _teeth_? If so, where are they situated?\r\n\r\nNote along each side extending to the base of the tail a line of\r\nmodified scales, on each scale a little mucous tube, the whole series\r\nconstituting the _lateral line_. These scales are intimately\r\nassociated with a large nerve (the _vagus_), and probably serve an\r\nimportant part, not yet clearly understood, in the life of the fish.\r\n\r\nLift up the flap in front of one of the pectoral fins. This is the\r\n_opercular flap_ which covers the gills that lie beneath. Bend this\r\nforward and find four _gill-arches_, each with its double fringe of\r\n_gills_. Note the _gill-rakers_, short and blunt, on the first\r\ngill-arch. Note also on the under side of the flaps turned back,\r\ndelicate red gill-like structures covered by a membrane. These are the\r\n_false gills_ or _pseudo-branchiæ_, larger in most fishes than in the\r\nsunfish. The gills in the fish subserve the same function as the gills\r\nof the crayfish, that of purifying the blood by eliminating\r\ncarbonic-acid gas from it and taking up oxygen from the air mixed with\r\nor dissolved in the water. Organs subserving the same purposes in\r\ndifferent kinds of animals as, for example, the gills in fish and in\r\ncrayfish, are called _analogous structures_. But there is an important\r\nmorphological difference between the fish's gills and the gills of the\r\ncrayfish. In the latter animal they are outgrowths of the basal segments\r\nof the walking-legs; in the fish they are outgrowths from the alimentary\r\ncanal. The internal gills of the young toad (tadpole) arise in the same\r\nway as those of a fish. Structures which are identical in their origin,\r\nlike the gills of tadpole and fish, are called _homologous structures_.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the sunfish from a lateral aspect, showing the\r\nexternal parts named.\r\n\r\n    =Internal Structure.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Insert one point of the\r\n    scissors a little to one side of the anus and cut dorsally on the\r\n    left side of the body to the backbone. Now cut anteriorly from the\r\n    anus along the ventral wall to where the jaws unite, and cut, also\r\n    anteriorly, along the dorsal wall until the left side of the body\r\n    can be removed. Bend the opercular flap backward over the eye and\r\n    pin the entire fish, uncut side down, to the bottom of the\r\n    dissecting-pan, covering it with water.\r\n\r\nThe above operation will have severed the large powerful _muscles_\r\nforming the body-wall and extending along the sides. Note a membranous\r\nsac completely filling a large dorsal cavity. This is the\r\n_swim-bladder_, a float filled with air which tends to give the fish\r\nthe same weight as the water it displaces. It arises as a diverticulum\r\nfrom the alimentary canal, but soon becomes permanently shut off from\r\nit. Beneath the swim-bladder is a large cavity filled with various\r\norgans, collectively known as the _viscera_. In vertebrate animals the\r\ncavity which contains the viscera is generally called the _peritoneal\r\ncavity_. It is lined by the _peritoneum_, a delicate membrane, part of\r\nwhich is deflected as the _mesentery_ over the alimentary canal and\r\nthe other organs, thus suspending them all from the dorsal wall. Note\r\nin the anterior end of the peritoneal cavity a large bi-lobed gland,\r\nthe _liver_, red in fresh, yellowish in alcoholic specimens. Its\r\nfunction, like that of the liver of the toad, is to store up nutriment\r\nfor the blood and to secrete a digestive fluid called _bile_. Behind\r\nthe liver note a long, convoluted tube. What is this tube? Unfold this\r\ntube, separating it from its enveloping membrane, the mesentery.\r\nThrust a probe down the throat and note that it passes into a\r\nthick-walled sac, the _stomach_. The mouth and gill-slits open into\r\nthe front part of the alimentary canal called the _pharynx_, which\r\nleads by a short tube, the _œsophagus_, into the stomach. Note the\r\nlarge, thickened portion of the alimentary canal leading from the\r\nstomach. This is the _pylorus_, and to its walls are attached a number\r\nof finger-like projections, the _pyloric cæca_. The pyloric cæca\r\nsecrete a fluid which is poured into the alimentary canal and which\r\nassists in the process of digestion somewhat as does the secretion\r\nfrom the pancreas of the toad. From the pylorus, passing backwards in\r\none or two loops, is the _small intestine_. Trace this to its exit.\r\nLying within the mesentery near the posterior end of the body-cavity\r\nnote a small red glandular mass, the _spleen_.\r\n\r\nAt the anterior end of the body in front of the liver and between the\r\nsets of gills note the small _pericardial cavity_ within which is\r\ncontained the _heart_. The pericardial cavity is separated from the\r\nperitoneal cavity by a thick muscular wall against which the liver\r\nabuts. The heart consists of four parts. The posterior part is a\r\nthin-walled reservoir, the _sinus venosus_, into which blood enters\r\nthrough the _jugular vein_ from the head and through the _cardinal vein_\r\nfrom the kidney. From the sinus venosus it passes forward into a large\r\nchamber, the _auricle_. Next it flows into the _ventricle_, where, by\r\nthe contraction of the walls, rhythmical pulsations force it into the\r\n_conus arteriosus_, thence into the _ventral aorta_, and lastly into the\r\ngills, where it is purified. After passing through the capillaries in\r\nthe fine gill-filaments it is again collected, now pure, by paired\r\narteries from each pair of gills, which arteries unite to form the\r\n_dorsal aorta_ extending backward just below the backbone to the end of\r\nthe tail. From the dorsal aorta a pair of arteries, the _subclavian_,\r\nare given off to the pectoral fins. At this point two other arteries\r\nbranch off ventrally, the first being the _cardiac artery_, which\r\ndistributes blood to the stomach and pyloric cæca. The second divides\r\ninto several long _mesenteric arteries_ supplying blood to all parts of\r\nthe intestine and spleen. In the caudal region blood is taken up through\r\nthe _caudal vein_ and carried forward to the kidneys. These strain out\r\nthe impurities arising from waste of tissues, after which the blood is\r\ncarried back to the sinus venosus through the cardinal vein. From the\r\nintestine it is gathered into the large _portal vein_ as in the toad.\r\nThe portal vein carries blood to the liver, where nutriment may be\r\nstored up, and from thence it flows back to the sinus venosus through a\r\nvery short thin-walled vessel, the _hepatic sinus_.\r\n\r\nThe _kidneys_, more or less united in one mass, lie in the posterior\r\npart of the body-cavity along the dorsal wall. Note running from each\r\nside of the kidney a _ureter_ which unites with its fellow and opens\r\ninto a small _urinary bladder_ which discharges through a small\r\nopening immediately back of the anus.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive organs lie below the swim-bladder near the posterior\r\nend of the body-cavity. If the fish are caught in the spring, the\r\ngreater part of the body-cavity of the female is found to be filled with\r\nsmall eggs. When mature, these eggs are deposited by the mother fish in\r\nthe gravel of the stream-bed where they are fertilized by the\r\nsperm-cells poured over them by the male and left floating in the water.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system of fishes is best studied in a specimen treated\r\nwith nitric acid. Carefully remove the roof of the skull, thereby\r\nexposing the brain. Most anteriorly make out, as in the toad, the\r\npaired _olfactory lobes_. These are attached by long stalks to the\r\n_cerebrum_ or _forebrain_, which is followed by two large hollow\r\nlobes, the _midbrain_ or _optic lobes_. Behind the midbrain is the\r\n_cerebellum_. Following the cerebellum is the elongate _medulla\r\noblongata_, which tapers backward into the _spinal cord_. How far\r\nbackward does the spinal cord extend? On each side of the brain-case\r\nabout opposite the cerebellum are located the _auditory organs_, each\r\nconsisting of three _semicircular canals_ which lie in different\r\nplanes, and of the _vestibule_. These parts are filled with liquid,\r\nand suspended in the liquid in the vestibule are small calcareous\r\nbodies called _otoliths_ or _ear-stones_. Running out beneath from the\r\nmidbrain are the _optic nerves_, which cross, the left one connected\r\nwith the right eye, the right one with the left eye. From each side of\r\nthe medulla oblongata there is given off a large nerve, the _vagus_,\r\nwhich sends branches to the lateral line organs on either side, and\r\nextends backward to the stomach and viscera.\r\n\r\nFor further study of the nervous system see Parker's \"Zootomy,\" pp.\r\n122-130.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the nervous system as worked out.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--To make a good skeleton immerse a fresh or\r\n    preserved specimen for some time in a hot soap solution. When the\r\n    muscles have commenced to soften remove the body from the\r\n    solution, pick the flesh away, and leave to dry.\r\n\r\nNote that the main axis of the _skeleton_ is composed of _vertebræ_\r\nplaced end to end. How many vertebræ are there? What vertebræ bear\r\n_ribs_? The ribless ones beyond the body-cavity are called _caudal\r\nvertebræ_. Note the _interspinal bones_ which support the fins, with\r\nlarge muscles on either side to control their action. Note that the\r\ngroup of bones supporting the pectoral fin is attached to the back of\r\nthe brain-case and makes up the _shoulder girdle_. The ventral fins\r\nare attached to a rudimentary _pelvic girdle_, attached in front to\r\nthe shoulder girdle, as the shoulder girdle is in turn attached to the\r\nskull. It will be seen that the sunfish has no neck and we may say,\r\nalso, no back. Its skeleton consists only of a tail attached to the\r\nskull. The brain-case is made up of a number of bones closely joined\r\ntogether. From it is suspended the lower jaw, which comprises a number\r\nof bones but loosely attached to each other. Overlying these is the\r\nsystem of membrane bones already mentioned, including the opercle or\r\ngill-cover.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed study of the fish-skeleton see Parker's \"Zootomy,\" pp.\r\n86-101, or Parker and Haswell's \"Zoology,\" vol. II. pp. 183-195.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The sunfish or \"pumpkin-seed\" lives in\r\nquiet corners of the brooks and rivers, preferably under a log or at\r\nthe root of an old stump. It is a beautiful fish, shining \"like a\r\ncoin fresh from the mint.\" Its body is mottled golden, orange and\r\nblue, with metallic lustre, darker above, pale or yellowish below. Its\r\nfins are of the same color. The tip of its opercle is prolonged like\r\nan ear and jet black in color, with a dash of bright scarlet along its\r\nlower edge. Nearly all the thirty species of sunfish found in the\r\nUnited States have this black ear, but some have it long, some short,\r\nand in some it is trimmed with yellow or blue instead of scarlet.\r\n\r\nThe sunfish lays its eggs in the spring in a rude nest it scoops in the\r\ngravel, over which it stands guard with its bright fins spread, looking\r\nas big and dangerous as possible. When thus employed it takes the hook\r\nsavagely, perhaps regarding the worm as a dangerous enemy. The young\r\nfishes soon hatch, looking very much like their parents, although more\r\ntransparent and not so brightly colored. They grow rapidly, feeding on\r\ninsects and other small creatures, and reach their growth in two or\r\nthree years. They do not wander far and never willingly migrate.\r\nStudents should verify this account on the different species. A more\r\nexact study of the nests of the different species and the fishes'\r\ndefence of them would be a valuable addition to our knowledge. The most\r\nstriking traits of the habits of this fish are its vivacity and courage;\r\nit reveals its great muscular strength when captured. The sexes are\r\nsimilar in appearance and both defend the nest alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER FISHES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Dissection of the sunfish, _Apomotis_ sp.]\r\n\r\nFishes constitute the largest class of vertebrate animals and are to\r\nbe found everywhere in ponds, streams, or ocean. About 15,000 species\r\nof fish are known, of which 3,000 live in North America. The largest\r\nof all fishes is the basking shark (_Cetorhinus_), which reaches a\r\nlength of thirty-six feet. The smallest is the dwarf goby\r\n(_Mistichthys_), less than half an inch long, found in Luzon, one of\r\nthe Philippine Islands. Between these extremes is every variety in\r\nsize, form, and relative proportions. The body, for example, may be\r\ngreatly elongated and almost cylindrical as in the eels; or long and\r\nflattened from side to side as in the ribbon-fishes; or the head may\r\nbe very large, wider and higher than the rest of the body as in the\r\nanglers, or may have a great beak as in the sword-fish.\r\n\r\n=Body form and structure.=--When we consider the fish as a whole, we\r\nfind first a body formed for progression in the water, the typical fish\r\nbeing pointed at each end (the shorter point in front), and having the\r\nsides flattened, the back and belly rather narrow, and the motive power\r\nlocated in the fin on the tail. From this typical form diverge all\r\nconceivable variations, adaptations to every sort of fish life.\r\n\r\nMost fishes have the body covered with scales, although many have the\r\nskin naked or covered with small scales so hidden in the skin as to be\r\nhardly visible. The scales are small horny or bony plates which fit\r\ninto small pockets or folds of the skin, and are usually arranged\r\nshingle-fashion, overlapping each other. They are of various shapes,\r\nmostly classified as of three kinds, namely, squarish enamelled scales\r\ncalled ganoid, roundish smooth-edged called cycloid, and roundish\r\ntooth-edged called ctenoid.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the fish is relatively complex. Its bones are\r\ncomparatively soft, having little lime in them, indeed in many cases\r\nthey are mere cartilage. The vertebral column is made of twenty-four\r\nvertebræ in the typical fishes, the number in the others being variously\r\nincreased, or sometimes diminished. These vertebræ are of two classes,\r\nabdominal or body, and caudal or tail vertebræ. The former have a neural\r\narch which encloses the spinal cord and from which projects a spine.\r\nBelow, the processes spread apart, surrounding the kidneys and partly\r\nenclosing the air-bladder. To these processes ribs are loosely attached.\r\nThe caudal vertebræ have no ribs and leave no room below for viscera.\r\nTheir lower arch (hæmal), similar to the dorsal (neural) arch, surrounds\r\na blood-vessel. The fins of a fish are composed of bony rods or rays\r\njoined by membrane. Some of these rays may be unbranched and unjointed,\r\nbeing then known as spines, and usually occupy the front part of the\r\nfin. Other rays are made up of little joints and are usually branched\r\ntoward their tip. Such ones are called soft rays. Soft rays make up the\r\ngreatest part of most fins. The vertical fins are on the middle line of\r\nthe body. These are the dorsal above, anal below, and caudal forming the\r\nend of the tail. The paired pectoral and ventral fins are ranged one on\r\neach side corresponding to the arms and legs of higher animals. The\r\npectoral fin or arm is fastened to a series of bones called the shoulder\r\ngirdle. These bones do not correspond to those in the shoulder girdle of\r\nthe higher animals, and the various parts in the two structures are\r\ndifferently named. The uppermost bone of the shoulder girdle is usually\r\nattached to the skull. To the lowermost is attached the rudimentary\r\npelvis, which supports the hinder limb or ventral fin. Usually the\r\npelvis is farther back and loose in the flesh, but sometimes it is\r\nplaced far forward, being occasionally attached at the chin.\r\n\r\nThe head contains the various bones of the cranium, usually closely\r\nwedged together and not easily distinguished. The jaws are each made\r\nof several pieces; the lower one is suspended from the skull by a\r\nchain of three flat bones. The jaws may bear any one of a great\r\nvariety of forms of teeth or no teeth at all, and any of the bones of\r\nthe mouth-cavity and throat may have teeth as well. On the outside of\r\nthe head are numerous bones called membrane bones, because they are\r\nmade up of ossified membrane. The most important of these is the\r\nopercle or gill-cover. Within are the tongue with the five gill-arches\r\nattached to it below and to the floor of the skull above, the last\r\narch being usually modified to form the pharyngeal jaw.\r\n\r\nThe stomach may be a blind sac with entrance and exit close together,\r\nor it may have the form of a tube or siphon. At its end are often\r\nfound the large glandular tubes called pyloric cæca which secrete a\r\ndigestive fluid; and to its right side is attached the red spleen. The\r\nliver is large, having usually, but not always, a gall-bladder; it\r\npours its secretion into the upper intestine. In fishes which feed on\r\nplants the intestine is long, but it is short in those which eat\r\nflesh, because flesh is digested in the stomach, not in the\r\nintestines. The kidney is usually a long slender forked gland showing\r\nlittle variation. The egg-glands differ greatly in different sorts of\r\nfishes, the size and number of eggs varying equally. The air-bladder\r\nis a lung which has lost both lung structure and respiratory function,\r\nbeing simply a sac filled with gas secreted from the blood, and lying\r\nin the upper part of the abdominal cavity. It is subject to many\r\nvariations. In the gar pike, bow-fin and the lung-fishes of the\r\ntropics, the air-bladder is a true lung used for breathing and\r\nconnected by a sort of glottis with the œsophagus. In others it is\r\nrudimentary or even wholly wanting, while in still others its function\r\nas an air-sac is especially pronounced, and in many it is joined\r\nthrough the modified bones of the neck to the organ of hearing.\r\n\r\nThe blood of the fish is purified by circulation through its gills.\r\nThese are a series of slender filaments attached to bony arches. Among\r\nthem the blood flows in and out, coming in contact with the water\r\nwhich the fish takes in through its mouth and which passes across the\r\ngills to be expelled through the gill-openings. The blood is received\r\nfrom the body into the first chamber of the heart, a muscular sac\r\ncalled the auricle. From here it passes into the ventricle, a chamber\r\nwith thicker walls, the contraction of which sends it to the gills,\r\nthence without return to the heart it passes over the body. The\r\ncirculation of blood in fishes is slow, and the blood, which receives\r\nrelatively little oxygen, is cold, being but little warmer than the\r\nwater in which the individual fish lives.\r\n\r\nInside the cranium or brain-case is the brain, small and composed of\r\nganglia which are smooth at the surface and contain little gray\r\nmatter. At the posterior end of the brain is the thickened end of the\r\nspinal cord, called the medulla oblongata. Next overlapping this is\r\nthe cerebellum, always single. Before this lie the largest pair of\r\nganglia, the optic lobes or midbrain, round, smooth, and hollow. From\r\nthe under side of these, nerves run to the eyes with or without a\r\nchiasma or crossing. In front of the optic lobes and smaller than them\r\nis the cerebrum or forebrain, usually of two ganglia but sometimes (in\r\nthe sharks) united into one. In front of these are the small olfactory\r\nlobes which send nerves to the nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe sense organs are well developed. The sense of touch has in some\r\nfishes special organs for its better effectiveness. For instance\r\ncertain fin-rays in some fishes, or, as in the catfish, slender,\r\nfleshy, whip-like processes on the head, are developed as feelers or\r\nspecial tactile organs. Other fishes, the sucker and loach for\r\nexample, have specially sensitive lips and noses with which they\r\nexplore their surroundings. The sense of taste does not seem to be\r\nwell developed in this group. Taste-papillæ are often present in small\r\nnumbers on the tongue or on the palate. The sense of smell is good.\r\nThe olfactory organs, one on each side of the head, are hollow\r\nsac-like depressions, closed at the rear. In most cases each sac has\r\ntwo openings or nostrils. The sense of hearing is not very keen. The\r\nears are fluid-filled sacs buried in the skull, and without external\r\nor (except in a few cases) internal opening. Fishes are far more\r\nsensitive to sudden jars or sudden movements than to any sound. They\r\npossess what is generally believed to be a special sense organ not\r\nfound in other animals. This is the lateral line which extends along\r\nthe sides of the body and which consists of a series of modified\r\nscales (each one with a mucous channel) richly supplied with nerves.\r\nThe eyes are usually large and conspicuous. They differ mainly from\r\nthe eyes of other vertebrates in their myopic spherical crystalline\r\nlens, made necessary by the density of the medium in which fishes\r\nlive. There are usually no eyelids, the skin of the body being\r\ncontinuous but transparent over the eyes. Being near-sighted, fishes\r\ndo not discriminate readily among forms, their special senses fitting\r\nthem in general to distinguish motions of their enemies or prey rather\r\nthan to ascertain exactly the nature of particular things.\r\n\r\nThe colors of fishes are in general appearance protective. Thus most\r\nindividuals are white on the belly, mimicking the color of the sky to\r\nthe enemy which pursues them from below. Seen from above most of them\r\nare greenish, like the water, or brownish gray and mottled, like the\r\nbottom. Those that live on sand are sand-colored, those on lava black,\r\nand those among rose-red sea-weeds bright red. In many cases,\r\nespecially among kinds that are protected by their activity, brilliant\r\ncolors and showy markings are developed. This is especially true among\r\nfishes of the coral reefs, though species scarcely less brilliant are\r\nfound among the darters of our American brooks.\r\n\r\nAmong fresh-water fishes bright colors, crimson, scarlet, blue, creamy\r\nwhite, are developed in the breeding season, the then vigorous males\r\nbeing the most highly colored. Many of the feeble minnows even become\r\nvery brilliant in the nuptial season of May and June. Color in fishes is\r\nformed by minute oil-sacs on the scales, and it often changes quickly\r\nwith changes in the nervous condition of the individuals.\r\n\r\n=Development and life-history.=--The breeding habits of fishes are\r\nextremely varied. Most fishes do not pair, but in some cases pairing\r\ntakes place as among higher animals. Ordinarily fishes lay their eggs\r\non the bottom in shallow water, either in brooks, lakes, or in the\r\nsea. The eggs of fishes are commonly called spawn, and egg-laying is\r\nreferred to as spawning. The spawn of some fishes is esteemed a\r\nspecial food delicacy. Spring is the usual time of spawning, though\r\nsome fishes spawn in summer and some even in winter; generally they\r\nmove from their usual haunts for the purpose. The eggs of the\r\ndifferent species vary much in size, ranging from an inch and a half\r\nin diameter (barn-door skate) down to the tiniest dots, like those of\r\nthe herring. The number of eggs laid also varies greatly. The trout\r\nlays from 500 to 1,000, the salmon about 10,000, the herring 30,000 to\r\n40,000, and some species of river fish 500,000, while certain\r\nflounders, sturgeons, and others each lay several millions of eggs.\r\nThe adults rarely pay any attention to the eggs, which are hatched\r\ndirectly by the heat of the sun or by heat absorbed from the water.\r\nThe length of incubation varies much. When the young fish leaves the\r\negg-shell it carries, in the case of most species, a part of the yolk\r\nstill hanging to its body. Its eyes are very large, and its fins are\r\nrepresented by thin strips of membrane. It usually undergoes no great\r\nchanges in development from the first, resembling the adult except in\r\nsize. But some of the ocean fishes show a metamorphosis almost as\r\nstriking as that of insects or toads or frogs.\r\n\r\nSome fishes build nests. Sticklebacks build elaborate nests in the\r\nbrooks and defend them with spirit. Sunfishes do the same, but the\r\nnests are clumsier and not so well cared for.\r\n\r\nThe salmon is the type of fishes which run up from the sea to lay\r\ntheir eggs in fresh water. The king salmon of the Columbia River, for\r\nexample, leaves the sea in the high waters of March and ascends\r\nwithout feeding for over a thousand miles, depositing its spawn in\r\nsome small brook in the fall. After making this long journey to lay\r\nthe eggs, the salmon become much exhausted, battered and worn, and are\r\noften attacked by parasitic fungi. They soon die, probably none of\r\nthem ever surviving to lay eggs a second time.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--A fish is an aquatic vertebrate, fitted to breathe\r\nthe air contained in water, and never developing fingers and toes.\r\nAccepting this broad general definition we find at once that there are\r\nvery great differences among fishes. Some differ more from others than\r\nthe ordinary forms differ from rabbits or birds. So although we have\r\nentitled this chapter as if all fishes belonged to the class Pisces,\r\nwe cannot arrange them satisfactorily in less than three classes.\r\n\r\n=The lancelets (Leptocardii).=--The lowest class of fish-like animals\r\nis that of the lancelets, the Leptocardii. These little creatures,\r\ntranslucent, buried in the sand, of the size and form of a small\r\ntoothpick, are fishes reduced to their lowest terms. They have the\r\nform, life, and ways of a fish, but no differentiated skull, brain,\r\nheart, or eyes. Moreover they have no limbs, no jaws, no teeth, no\r\nscales. The few parts they do have are arranged as in a fish, and they\r\nshow something in common with the fish embryo. Lacking a distinct\r\nhead, the lancelets are put by some zoologists in a group called the\r\nAcrania, as opposed to the Craniata, which includes all the other\r\nvertebrates. Lancelets have been found in the North Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean, on the west coast of North America, on the east coast\r\nof South America and on the coasts of Japan, Australia, New Zealand,\r\nthe East Indies and Malayan Islands. The best-known members of the\r\ngroup belong to the genus _Amphioxus_. There are but one to two other\r\ngenera in the class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--A lamprey, _Petromyzon marinus_. (After\r\nGoode.)]\r\n\r\n=The lampreys and hag-fishes (Cyclostomata).=--The next class of\r\nfish-like animals is that of the lampreys (fig. 113) and hag-fishes,\r\nthe Cyclostomata. The lampreys and hags are easily distinguished from\r\nthe true fishes by their sucking mouth without jaws, their single\r\nmedian nostril, their eel-like shape and lack of lateral appendages or\r\npaired fins. The hag-fishes (_Myxine_), which are marine, attach\r\nthemselves by means of a sucker-like mouth to living fishes (the cod\r\nparticularly), gradually scraping and eating their way into the\r\nabdominal cavity of the fish. These hags or \"borers\" \"approach most\r\nnearly to the condition of an internal parasite of any vertebrate.\"\r\nThe lampreys, or lamprey-eels as they are often called because of\r\ntheir superficial resemblance to true eels, are both marine and\r\nfresh-water in their habitat, and most of them attach themselves to\r\nlive fishes and suck their blood. They also feed on crustacea,\r\ninsects, and worms. The brook-lamprey, _Lampetra wilderi_, is never\r\nparasitic. It reaches its full size in larval life and transforms\r\nsimply for spawning. The sea- and lake-lampreys ascend small\r\nfresh-water streams when ready to lay their eggs, few living to\r\nreturn. Sometimes small piles of stones are made for nests. The young\r\nundergo a considerable metamorphosis in their development. The largest\r\nsea-lampreys reach a length of three feet. The common brook-lampreys\r\nare from eight to twelve inches long only.\r\n\r\n=The true fishes (Pisces).=--All the other fish-like animals are\r\ngrouped in the class Pisces. They are characterized, when compared\r\nwith the lower fish-like forms just referred to, by the presence of\r\njaws, shoulder girdle, and pelvic girdle. The class includes both the\r\ncartilaginous and bony fishes, and is divided into three sub-classes,\r\nnamely, the Elasmobranchii, including the sharks, rays, skates,\r\ntorpedoes, etc., the Holocephali, including the chimæras (a few\r\nstrange-bodied forms), and the Teleostomi, including all the other\r\nfishes, as the trout, catfishes, darters, bass, herring, cod,\r\nmackerel, sturgeons, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n=The sharks, skates, etc. (Elasmobranchii).=--The sharks and skates\r\nare characterized by the possession of a skeleton composed of\r\ncartilage and not bone, as in the bony fishes; they have no operculum;\r\ntheir teeth are distinct, often large and highly specialized, and\r\ntheir eggs are few and very large. There are two principal groups\r\namong Elasmobranchii, viz., the sharks, which usually have an elongate\r\nbody, and always have the gill-openings on the sides, and the rays or\r\nskates, which have a broad flattened body with the gill-openings\r\nalways on the under side. All the members of both groups are marine.\r\nThe sharks are active, fierce, usually large fishes, which live in the\r\nsurface-waters of the ocean and make war on other marine animals, all\r\nof the species except half a dozen being fish-eaters. The shark's\r\nmouth is on the under side of the usually conical head, and the\r\nanimal often turns over on its back in order to seize its prey. The\r\nlargest American sharks, and the largest of all fishes, are the great\r\nbasking-sharks (_Cetorhinus_), which reach a length of nearly forty\r\nfeet. They get their name from their habit of gathering in numbers and\r\nfloating motionless on the surface. They feed chiefly on fishes.\r\n\r\nThe hammer-headed sharks (_Sphyrna_) are odd sharks which have the\r\nhead mallet or kidney shaped, twice as wide as long, the eyes being\r\nsituated on the ends of the lateral expansions of the head. The\r\nman-eating or great white sharks (_Carcharodon_) are nearly as large\r\nas the basking-sharks, and are extremely voracious. They will follow\r\nships for long distances for the refuse thrown overboard. They do not\r\nhesitate to attack man. Among the more familiar smaller sharks are the\r\ndog-fishes and sand-sharks of our Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThe rays and skates are also carnivorous, but are with few exceptions\r\nsluggish, lying at the bottom of shallow shore-waters. They feed on\r\ncrabs, molluscs, and bottom-fishes. The small common skates,\r\n\"tobacco-boxes\" (_Raja erinacea_) (fig. 114), about twenty inches long,\r\nand the larger \"barn-door skates\" (_R. lævis_), are numerous along the\r\nAtlantic coast from Virginia northward. Especially interesting members\r\nof this group, because of the peculiar character of the injuries\r\nproduced by them, are the sting-rays and torpedoes or electric-rays. The\r\nsting-rays (_Dasyatis_) have spines near the base of the tail which\r\ncause very painful wounds. The torpedoes (_Narcine_) have two large\r\nelectrical organs, one on each side of the body just behind the head,\r\nwith which they can give a strong electric shock. \"The discharge from a\r\nlarge individual is sufficient to temporarily disable a man, and were\r\nthese animals at all numerous they would prove dangerous to bathers.\"\r\nVery different from the typical rays in external appearance are the\r\nsaw-fishes (_Pristis pectinatis_) which belong to this group. The body\r\nis elongate and shark-like, and has a long saw-like snout. This saw,\r\nwhich in large individuals may reach a length of six feet and a breadth\r\nof twelve inches, makes its owner formidable among the small sardines\r\nand herring-like fishes on which it feeds. The saw-fishes live in\r\ntropical rivers, descending to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--The common skate, _Raja erinacea_. (From\r\nKingsley.)]\r\n\r\n=The bony fishes (Teleostomi).=--The bony or true fishes are\r\ndistinguished from the lampreys and sharks and rays by having in\r\ngeneral the skeleton bony, not cartilaginous, the skull provided with\r\nmembrane bones, and the eggs small and many. In this group are\r\nincluded all the fishes of our fresh-water lakes, ponds, and streams\r\nas well as most of the marine forms. Fish life, being spent under\r\nwater, is not familiar to most of us, and beginning students are\r\nrarely helped enough in getting acquainted with the different kinds\r\nand the interesting habits of fishes. But they offer a field of study\r\nwhich is really of unusual interest and profit. We can refer in the\r\nfollowing paragraphs to but few of the numerous common and readily\r\nfound kinds, and to these but briefly.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the sunfish, studied as example of the bony fishes,\r\nare the various kinds of bass, as the \"crappie\" (_Pomoxis annularis_),\r\nthe calico bass (_P. separoides_), the rock-bass (_Ambloplites\r\nrupestris_) and the large-mouthed and small-mouthed black bass\r\n(_Micropterus salmoides_ and _M. dolomieu_ respectively). All the\r\nmembers of this sunfish and bass family are carnivorous fishes\r\nespecially characteristic of the Mississippi valley.\r\n\r\nAnother family of many species especially common in the clear, swift,\r\nand strong Eastern rivers is that of the darters and perches. The\r\ndarters are little slender-bodied fishes which lie motionless on the\r\nbottom, moving like a flash when disturbed and slipping under stones\r\nout of sight of their enemies. Some are most brilliantly colored,\r\nsurpassing in this respect all other fresh-water fishes.\r\n\r\nUnlike the sunfishes and darters are the catfishes, composing a great\r\nfamily, the Siluridæ. The catfish (_Ameiurus_) gets its name from the\r\nlong feelers about its mouth; from these feelers also come its other\r\nnames of horned pout, or bull-head. It has no scales, but its spines are\r\nsharp and often barbed or jagged and capable of making a severe wound.\r\n\r\nRemotely allied to the catfish are the suckers, minnows, and chubs,\r\nwith smooth scales, soft fins and soft bodies and the flesh full of\r\nsmall bones. These little fish are very numerous in species, some\r\nkinds swarming in all fresh water in America, Europe, and Asia. They\r\nusually swim in the open water, the prey of every carnivorous fish,\r\nmaking up by their fecundity and their insignificance for their lack\r\nof defensive armature. In some species the male is adorned in the\r\nspring with bright pigment, red, black, blue, or milk-white. In some\r\ncases, too, it has bony warts or horns on its head or body. Such forms\r\nare known to the boys as horned dace.\r\n\r\nMost interesting to the angler are the fishes of the salmon and trout\r\n(fig. 115) family, because they are gamy, beautiful, excellent as food\r\nand above all perhaps because they live in the swiftest and clearest\r\nwaters in the most charming forests. The salmon live in the ocean most\r\nof their life, but ascend the rivers from the sea to deposit their\r\neggs. The king salmon (_Oncorhynchus tschawytscha_) of the Columbia\r\ngoes up the great river more than a thousand miles, taking the whole\r\nsummer for it, and never feeding while in fresh water. Besides the\r\ndifferent kinds of salmon, the black-spotted or true trout, the charr\r\nor red-spotted trout of various species, the whitefish (_Coregonus_),\r\nthe grayling (_Thymallus signifer_) and the famous ayu of Japan belong\r\nto this family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--The rainbow-trout, _Salmo iridens_. (From\r\nspecimen.)]\r\n\r\nIn the sea are multitudes of fish forms arranged in many families. The\r\nmyriad species of eels agree in having no ventral fins and in having\r\nthe long flexible body of the snake. Most of them live in the sea, but\r\nthe single genus (_Anguilla_) or true eel which ascends the rivers is\r\nexceedingly abundant and widely distributed. Most eels are extremely\r\nvoracious, but some of them have mouths that would barely admit a\r\npin-head. The codfish (_Gadus callarias_) is a creature of little\r\nbeauty but of great usefulness, swarming in all arctic and subarctic\r\nseas. The herring (_Clupea harengus_), soft and weak in body, are more\r\nnumerous in individuals than any other fishes. The flounders (fig.\r\n116) of many kinds lie flat on the sea-bottom. They have the head so\r\ntwisted that the two eyes occur both together on the uppermost side.\r\nThe members of the great mackerel tribe swim in the open sea, often in\r\ngreat schools. Largest and swiftest of these is the sword-fish\r\n(_Xiphias gladius_), in which the whole upper jaw is grown together to\r\nform a long bony sword, a weapon of offence that can pierce the wooden\r\nbottom of a boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--The winter flounder, _Pseudopleuronectes\r\namericanus_. (After Goode.)]\r\n\r\nMany of the ocean fishes are of strange form and appearance. The\r\nsea-horses (_Hippocampus_ sp.) (fig. 117) are odd fishes covered with\r\na bony shell and with the head having the physiognomy of that of a\r\nhorse. They are little fishes rarely a foot long, and cling by their\r\ncurved tails to floating seaweed. The pipefish (_Syngnathus fuscum_)\r\nis a sea-horse straightened out. The porcupine-fishes and swellfishes\r\n(_Tetraodontidæ_) have the power of filling the stomach with air which\r\nthey gulp from the surface. They then escape from their pursuers by\r\nfloating as a round spiny ball on the surface. The flying-fishes\r\n(_Exocœtus_) leap out of the water and sail for long distances through\r\nthe air, like grasshoppers. They cannot flap their long pectoral fins\r\nand do not truly fly; nevertheless they move swiftly through the air\r\nand thus escape their pursuers. In its structure a flying-fish differs\r\nlittle from a pike or other ordinary fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--A sea-horse, _Hippocampus heptagonus_.\r\n(After Goode.)]\r\n\r\nFor an account of the fishes of North America see Jordan's \"Manual of\r\nVertebrates,\" eighth edition, pp. 5-173, and Jordan and Evermann's\r\n\"Fishes of North and Middle America,\" where the 3,127 species known\r\nfrom our continent are described in detail with illustrative figures.\r\n\r\n=Habits and adaptations.=--The chief part of a fish's life is devoted\r\nto eating, and as most fishes feed on other fishes, all are equally\r\nconsiderably occupied in providing for their own escape.\r\n\r\nIn general the provisions for seizing prey are confined to sharp teeth\r\nand the strong muscles which propel the caudal fin. But in some cases\r\nspecial contrivances appear. In one large group known collectively as\r\nthe \"anglers\" the first spine of the dorsal fin hangs over the mouth.\r\nIt has at its tip a fleshy appendage which serves as a bait. Little\r\nfishes nibble at this, the mouth opens, and they are gone. In the deep\r\nseas, many fishes are provided with phosphorescent spots or lanterns\r\nwhich light up the dark waters, and enable them to see their prey. In\r\nstorms these lantern-fishes sometimes lose their bearings and are\r\nthrown upward to the surface.\r\n\r\nIn general the more predatory in its habits any fish is the sharper\r\nits teeth, and the broader its mouth. Among brook-fishes the pickerel\r\nhas the largest mouth and the sharpest teeth. It has been called a\r\n\"mere machine for the assimilation of other organisms.\" The trout has\r\na large mouth and sharp teeth. It is a swift, voracious, and predatory\r\nfish, feeding even on its own kind. The sunfish is less greedy and its\r\nmouth and teeth are smaller, though it too eats other fish.\r\n\r\nAs means of escape, most fishes depend on their speed in swimming. But\r\nsome hide among rocks and weeds, disguising themselves by a change in\r\ncolor to match their surroundings. Others, like the flounders and\r\nskates, lie flat on the bottom. Still others retreat to the shallows\r\nor the depths or the rock-pools or to any place safer than the open\r\nsea. Some are protected by spines which they erect when attacked. Some\r\nerect these spines only after they have been swallowed, tearing the\r\nstomach of their enemy and killing it, but too late to save\r\nthemselves. Again in some species the spines are armed with poison\r\nwhich benumbs the enemy. Sometimes an electric battery about the head\r\nor on the sides gives the biting fish a severe shock and drives him\r\naway. Such batteries are found in the electric rays or torpedo, in the\r\nelectric eel of Paraguay, the electric catfish of the Nile, the\r\nelectric stargazer and other fishes.\r\n\r\nSome fishes are protected by their poor and bitter flesh. Some have\r\nbony coats of mail and sometimes the coat of mail is covered with\r\nthorns, as in the porcupine-fish. This fish and various of its\r\nrelatives have the habit of filling the stomach with air when\r\ndisturbed, then floating belly upward, the thorny back only within\r\nreach of its enemies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--The remora, or cling fish, _Remoropsis\r\nbrachyptera_. Note sucker on top of head. (After Goode.)]\r\n\r\nMany species (cling fishes) attach themselves to the rocks by a fleshy\r\nsucking-disk. Some (_Remora_) (fig. 118) cling to larger fishes by a\r\nstrange sucking-disk on the head, a transformed dorsal fin, being thus\r\nshielded from the attacks of fish smaller than their protectors. Some\r\nsmall fishes seek the shelter of the floating jellyfishes, lurking\r\namong their poisoned tentacles. Others creep into the masses of\r\nfloating gulf-weed. Some creep into the shell of clams and snails. In\r\nthe open channel of a sponge, the mouth of a tunicate and in similar\r\ncavities of various animals, little fishes may be found. A few fishes\r\n(hag-fishes) are parasitic on others, boring their way into the body\r\nand devouring the muscles with their rasp-like teeth.\r\n\r\nSome fishes are provided with peculiar modifications of the gills\r\nwhich enable them to breathe for a time out of water. Such fish have\r\nthe pectoral fins modified for a rather poor kind of locomotion on\r\nland, thus enabling them to move from pond to pond or from stream to\r\nstream. In cold climates the fishes must either migrate to warmer\r\nlatitudes in winter, as some do, or withstand variously the cold,\r\noften freezing weather. Some fish can be frozen solid, and yet thaw\r\nout and resume active living. Some lie at the bottoms of deep pools\r\nthrough the colder periods, while many others, such as the minnows,\r\nchubs, and other kinds common in small streams, bury themselves in the\r\nmud, and lie dormant or asleep through the whole winter. On the other\r\nhand in countries where the long intense rainless summers dry up the\r\npools, some fishes have the habit of burying themselves in the mud,\r\nwhich, with slime from the body, forms about them a sort of tight\r\ncement ball in which they lie dormant until the rains come. \"Thus a\r\nlung-fish (called _Protopterus_), found in Asia and Africa, so\r\ncompletely slimes a ball of mud around it that it may live for more\r\nthan one season, perhaps many; it has been dug up and sent to England,\r\nstill enclosed in its round mud-case, and when it was placed in warm\r\nwater it awoke as well as ever.\"\r\n\r\n=Food-fishes and fish-hatcheries.=--Most fishes are suitable for food,\r\nthough not all. Some are too small to be worth catching or too bony to\r\nbe worth eating. Some of the larger ones, especially the sharks, are\r\ntough and rank. A few are bitter and in the tropics a number of\r\nspecies feed on poisonous coelenterates about the coral reefs,\r\nbecoming themselves poisonous in turn. But a fish is rarely poisonous\r\nor unwholesome unless it takes poisonous food. Where fishes of a kind\r\nspecially used for food gather in great numbers at certain seasons of\r\nthe year, fishing is carried on extensively and with an elaborate\r\nequipment. Such fisheries, some of which have been long known, are\r\nscattered all over the world. Along the shores of the Mediterranean\r\nSea, and on the coasts of Norway, France, the British Isles and Japan\r\nare numerous great fishing-places. But \"nowhere are there found such\r\nlarge fisheries as those along the northern Atlantic coasts of our own\r\ncontinent, extending from Massachusetts to Labrador. Especially on the\r\nbanks of Newfoundland are codfish, herring, and mackerel caught.\"\r\nAmong our fresh-water fisheries the great salmon fisheries of the\r\nPenobscot and Columbia rivers and of the Karluk and other rivers of\r\nAlaska are the best known. The whitefish of our Great Lakes is also\r\none of the important food-fishes of the world.\r\n\r\nIn many places fishes are raised in so-called hatcheries, not usually\r\nfor immediate consumption but for the purpose of stocking ponds and\r\nstreams either in the neighborhood of the hatchery or in distant\r\nwaters which the special species cultivated has not been able\r\nnaturally to reach. The eggs of some fishes are large and\r\nnon-adherent, two features which greatly favor artificial impregnation\r\nand hatching. In the hatcheries the eggs are put first into warm\r\nwater, where development begins; they are then removed into cool\r\nwater, which arrests development without injury, making shipment\r\npossible. The eggs of salmon and trout in particular can be sent long\r\ndistances to suitable streams or ponds. The eggs of the shad have been\r\nthus carried from the East to the streams of California and trout have\r\nbeen distributed to many streams in our country which by themselves\r\nthey could never have reached.\r\n\r\nThe salmon is a conspicuous example of those fishes which can be\r\nartificially propagated. The eggs of the salmon are large, firm, and\r\nseparate from each other. If the female fish be caught when the eggs\r\nare ripe and her body be pressed over a pan of water the eggs will\r\nflow out into the water. By a similar process the milt or male\r\nsperm-cells can be procured and poured over the eggs to fertilize\r\nthem. The young after hatching are kept for a few days or weeks in\r\nartificial pools, till the yolk-sacs are absorbed and they can take\r\ncare of themselves. They are then turned into the stream, where they\r\ndrift tail foremost with the current and pass downward to the sea. All\r\ntrout may be treated in similar fashion, but there are many\r\nfood-fishes which cannot be handled in this way. In some the eggs are\r\nsmall or soft, or viscid and adhering in bunches. In others the\r\nlife-habits make artificial fertilization impossible. Such species are\r\nartificially reared only by catching the young and taking them from\r\none stream to another. To this type belong the black bass, the\r\nsunfish, the catfish and other familiar forms.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[16] The author wishes to call the attention of teacher and student to\r\nthe plan (referred to in the Preface, page v) adopted in writing the\r\ndirections for the dissections. The sequence of the references to the\r\nvarious organs depends on the actual course of the dissection, and not\r\nupon the association of organs in systems. And the directions are so\r\nmuch condensed that they are hardly more than a means of orienting the\r\nstudent, leaving him to work out independently, or by the aid of more\r\ndetailed accounts (sometimes specifically referred to), the details of\r\nthe dissection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n            BRANCH CHORDATA (_Continued_). CLASS BATRACHIA:\r\n                            THE BATRACHIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe structure, life-history, and habits of the garden-toad (_Bufo\r\nlentiginosus_) have already been studied (see Chapter II and Chapter\r\nXII).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           OTHER BATRACHIANS.\r\n\r\nThe class Batrachia includes the animals familiarly known as cœcilians,\r\nsirens, mud-puppies, salamanders, toads, and frogs. Although differing\r\nplainly from fishes in appearance and habits, the batrachians are really\r\nclosely related to them, resembling them in all but a few essential\r\ncharacters. Among the distinctive characters of batrachians may be noted\r\nthe absence of fins supported by fin-rays, the presence usually of\r\nwell-developed legs for walking or leaping, and the absence or reduction\r\nof certain bones of the head connected with the gills and lower jaw and\r\nwhich are well developed in the fishes. The batrachians stand in\r\nsomewhat intermediate position between the fishes and the reptiles,\r\nshowing some of the characters of both. They are, like fishes and\r\nreptiles, cold-blooded. In their adult condition some are terrestrial\r\nand some aquatic as to habitat, but all have an aquatic larval life. The\r\nwater-inhabiting young breathe at first by means of gills, later lungs\r\nbegin to develop, and for a time both gills and lungs are used in\r\nrespiration. Finally in the adult condition in almost all of the forms\r\nthe gills are wholly lost and breathing is done by the lungs and skin\r\nsolely. Correlated with the change of habits from larval to adult stage\r\nthere is usually a well-marked metamorphosis in post-embryonic\r\ndevelopment. This metamorphosis is specially striking among the frogs\r\nand toads. None of the aquatic forms is marine, salt water always\r\nkilling eggs, larvæ or adults. Batrachians are found all over the world,\r\nalthough there are few in the extreme North. They are most abundant in\r\nwarm and tropical lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--The tiger salamander. (From Jenkins and\r\nKellogg.)]\r\n\r\n=Body form and organization.=--The body varies from a long and\r\nslender, truly snake-like form as in the tropical cœcilians through\r\nthe usual salamander (fig. 119) shape, where it is more robust but\r\nstill elongate and tailed, to the heavy, squat, tailless condition of\r\nthe toads. Legs, with five digits, are usually present, and are used\r\nfor swimming, walking, or leaping. The legs are longest and best\r\ndeveloped in the short tailless frog and toad forms which are mostly\r\nterrestrial, and are short and weak in the tailed salamander forms,\r\nmany of which are aquatic. The skin is almost always naked, showing a\r\nmarked difference from the scaled condition of reptiles and most of\r\nthe fishes, and its cells secrete a slimy, sticky, usually whitish\r\nfluid, which in some cases is irritating, or even poisonous. The skin\r\nis sometimes thrown up into folds or ridges, and in some species is\r\nelevated to form a kind of fin on the tail or back. This unpaired fin\r\ndiffers from the dorsal fin (and other fins) of fishes in not being\r\nsupported by rayed processes of the skeleton. There are in some\r\nbatrachians traces of an exoskeleton in the presence of scale-like\r\nstructures in the skin or in the horny nails on the digits, but these\r\ncases are rare. The skin contains pigment-cells and many of the\r\nbatrachians are brilliantly colored and patterned; some of the pigment\r\nis carried by special contractile or expansile cells, the\r\nchromatophores (see account of chromatophores of the Cephalopoda, p.\r\n256), so that the animal can change its tint and markings more or less\r\nrapidly. All the batrachians possess external gills in their aquatic\r\nlarval stage, and in a few forms, as the sirens and mud-puppies, gills\r\nare retained all through life. These gills are branched folds of the\r\nskin abundantly supplied with blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the batrachian body the usual vertebrate\r\ncharacters appear, the body-organs being arranged with reference to a\r\nsupporting and protecting internal bony skeleton. The head is plainly\r\nset off from the rest of the body and bears the mouth and the organs of\r\nhearing and sight. Certain so-called lateral sense organs, the function\r\nof which is not exactly known, occur arranged in three lines on each\r\nside of the body of some of the forms. Both pairs of limbs are present\r\nand functional in almost all of the species. In the cœcilians the limbs\r\nare wholly wanting; in the sirens only the fore legs are present.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=--The most obvious skeletal differences among batrachians\r\nare those due to variations in external form. While there are as many\r\nas 100 vertebræ in some of the elongate long-tailed salamanders (even\r\n250 in the strange snake-like cœcilians), there are but 10 (the last\r\nor tenth being the rod-shaped bone called the urostyle) in the short,\r\ntailless frogs and toads. To any of the vertebræ except the first (the\r\nsingle cervical vertebra) and the last, ribs may be attached and the\r\ncœcilians have about as many pairs of ribs as vertebræ. In the frogs\r\nand toads, however, the ribs are lost. In any case they are never\r\nfastened by their lower ends to the breast-bone.\r\n\r\nThe alimentary canal is usually not much longer than the body and is\r\nplainly divided into mouth, pharynx, œsophagus, small intestine, large\r\nintestine or rectum, and anal opening. The teeth when present occur on\r\nboth the jaws and the palate. They are small, sharp, point backward\r\nand are fused to the bones. They are wholly wanting in the toad and in\r\nsome other allied forms. The tongue may be wanting, or may be\r\nimmovably fixed to the floor of the mouth, or as in the frogs,\r\nfastened at its front end but free behind, so that the hinder end can\r\nbe protruded far from the mouth for the purpose of catching insects.\r\n\r\nThe organs of respiration are gills, external and internal, lungs,\r\ntrachea or windpipe, and the skin. In the earliest larval stages all\r\nbatrachians have gills; later, in most cases, the gills become reduced\r\nand disappear, while at the same time lungs are developing. In some\r\nsalamanders the lungs never develop, but the animals, in their adult\r\nstage, breathe wholly by means of the skin. In a few cases, as in the\r\nsiren and mud-puppies, gills are retained through the whole life,\r\nalthough lungs are also present in the adult stage. The lungs are two\r\nin number, a right and a left lung, and are simple sacs with the walls\r\nmore or less folded or thrown into ridges and richly supplied with\r\nblood-vessels. The front end of the lungs opens directly into the\r\npharynx or, in the more elongate batrachians, is connected with it by\r\na tubular trachea or windpipe. In the frogs and toads there are vocal\r\ncords stretched across the short windpipe; the vibration of these\r\ncords produces the croaking.\r\n\r\nThe heart is always three-chambered, consisting of the right and left\r\nauricles and a single ventricle. The circulation of the more\r\ngeneralized salamanders like the mud-puppies is essentially like that\r\nof a fish. In the frogs and toads there is a distinct advance beyond\r\nthis condition. The red corpuscles of the blood are oval in shape and\r\nare the largest found among any of the vertebrates.\r\n\r\nIn the nervous system the small size of the hindbrain or cerebellum is\r\nnoticeable. The sense organs are fairly well developed. The skin of the\r\nwhole body is provided with tactile nerve-endings. There are special\r\ntaste organs on the lining membrane of the tongue and mouth-cavity. The\r\neyes have no lids in some of the lower forms; most of the frogs and\r\ntoads have an upper lid but no under one, although a thin membrane,\r\ncalled the nictitating membrane, arises from the lower margin of the eye\r\nand can be drawn up over it. The ears have no external parts, other than\r\nthe thin tympanic membranes. The nostrils of frogs and toads can be\r\nclosed by the contraction of certain special muscles.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The sexes are distinct, and in most cases\r\nthe young hatch from eggs. A few of the salamanders give birth to free\r\nyoung. The eggs are usually in strings or chains enclosed in a clear\r\ngelatinous substance; these chains of eggs are either simply dropped\r\ninto the water or are fastened to water-plants. The young, called\r\ntadpoles (fig. 120), in their earlier larval stages are extremely\r\nfish-like in character, long-bodied, tailed, swimming freely about by\r\nmeans of the fin-like flattened tail, and breathing by means of\r\nexternal gills. Nor do they show any sign of legs. As the tadpoles\r\ngrow and develop the legs begin to appear, the hind legs first in the\r\nfrogs and toads, the fore legs first in the salamanders; lungs\r\ndevelop and the gills disappear (except in the cases of the few forms\r\nwhich retain gills through life). The tail shortens and finally\r\ndisappears in the frogs and toads; with the salamanders the tail-fin\r\nonly is lost. At the same time the change from water to land is made.\r\nFurther growth is very slow; frogs are not really adult, that is,\r\ncapable of producing young, until they are five years old, and they\r\nmay continue to increase in size until they are ten years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Tadpoles. (Photograph from life by Cherry\r\nKearton; permission of Cassel & Co.)]\r\n\r\nThe food of the adult batrachians is almost exclusively small animals,\r\nparticularly insects and worms. Crustaceans, snails, and young fish\r\nare also eaten. The tadpoles also eat vegetable matter. Almost all\r\nbatrachians are nocturnal in habit, remaining concealed by day. In the\r\nzones in which cold winters occur they hibernate or pass the winter in\r\na torpid condition, or state of \"suspended animation,\" or, as it is\r\nsaid, they sleep through the winter. Frogs burrow into the mud at the\r\nbottom of ponds at the approach of winter and come forth early in the\r\nspring to lay their eggs. Most batrachians are very tenacious of life,\r\nbeing able to withstand long periods of fasting and serious\r\nmutilation, and most of them can regenerate certain lost parts, such\r\nas the tail or legs.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The living Batrachia are divided into three orders,\r\nviz., the Urodela, including the sirens, mud-puppies, salamanders, and\r\nnewts, batrachians which retain the tail throughout life, having\r\ngenerally two pairs of limbs of approximately equal size, and\r\nsometimes possessing gills or gill-slits in the adult condition; the\r\nAnura, or frogs and toads, with no tail in the adult condition, with\r\nshort and broad trunk, with hind limbs greatly exceeding the fore\r\nlimbs in size, and never with gills or gill-slits in the adult stage;\r\nand the Gymnophiona, or cæcilians, snake-like batrachians having\r\nneither limbs nor tail, with a dermal exoskeleton and without gills or\r\ngill-slits in the adult.\r\n\r\n    =Mud-puppies, salamanders, etc. (Urodela).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--If\r\n    possible obtain specimens of mud-eels (_Siren_), common in the\r\n    South, or mud-puppies (_Necturus_), common in the central North,\r\n    as examples of batrachians with gills persisting in the adult\r\n    stage. One or more species of _Amblystoma_ may be found in almost\r\n    any part of the country, and larvæ of large size may be found with\r\n    the external gills. For an example of the general long-tailed or\r\n    Urodelous type of batrachian any salamander or newt occurring in\r\n    the vicinity of the school may be used. The little green triton or\r\n    eft (_Diemictylus viridiscens_) of the eastern States, or its\r\n    larger brown-backed congener of the Pacific coast (_D. torosus_)\r\n    is common in water, while another eft, the little red-backed\r\n    salamander, (_Plethodon_) is common in the woods under logs and\r\n    stones. The external characters of the body should be compared\r\n    with those of the toad. The skeleton should be prepared by\r\n    macerating away the flesh (for directions, see p. 452), and the\r\n    presence of the many caudal vertebræ and the ribs, the equality in\r\n    size of the legs, and other points should be noted. Compare with\r\n    skeleton of toad. Make drawings. It will be well, also, to dissect\r\n    out and examine the various internal organs of the salamander,\r\n    comparing them with the same organs in the toad. The salamander,\r\n    indeed, is in many ways better than the toad as an example of the\r\n    class. Its body is less adaptively modified and shows the\r\n    essentially fish-like character of the batrachian structure.\r\n\r\nThe batrachians which retain external gills in the adult stage are the\r\nmembers of two families of which the American representatives are known\r\nas mud-eels (_Siren_) and mud-puppies or water-dogs (_Necturus_). The\r\nmud-eels, which are found \"in the ditches in the swamps of the southern\r\nStates from South Carolina to the Rio Grande of Texas and up the\r\nMississippi as high as Alton, Illinois,\" are blackish in color, have no\r\nhind legs and are long and slender, with the tail shorter than the rest\r\nof the body. They reach a length of nearly three feet. The mud-puppies,\r\nfound in the Great Lakes and in the rivers of the upper Mississippi\r\nvalley, are brown with colored spots, and are about two feet long when\r\nfull grown. They have both fore and hind legs.\r\n\r\nA few salamanders, while not possessing external gills when adult, have\r\na spiracle or small circular opening in the side of the neck which leads\r\ninto the throat. The best-known American salamander of this kind is the\r\nlarge heavy-bodied blackish water-dog or \"hellbender\" (_Cryptobranchus_)\r\nof the Ohio River. It is about two feet long, and is \"a very\r\nunprepossessing but harmless creature.\" It has a conspicuous\r\nlongitudinal fold of skin along each side of the body. The largest known\r\nbatrachian, the giant salamander of Japan (_Megalobatrachus_), reaching\r\na length of three feet, is related to the water-dog.\r\n\r\nOf all the salamanders the most interesting are the blunt-nosed\r\nsalamanders (_Amblystoma_). A dozen or more species of _Amblystoma_\r\noccur in North America, of which _tigrinum_, a dark-brown species with\r\nmany irregular yellow blotches sometimes arranged in cross-bands, is\r\nthe most widespread. The larvæ of some _Amblystoma_ retain their gills\r\nuntil they have reached a large size, and in one or two species the\r\nusual metamorphosis is very long delayed and the salamanders produce\r\nyoung while in the larval condition, that is, while retaining the\r\ngills and a compressed fin-like tail. In the case of a certain Mexican\r\nspecies (_A. maculatum_) it is believed that the final metamorphosis\r\nnever occurs. The Mexicans call these gilled larval _Amblystoma_\r\naxolotls, and use them for food. For a long time naturalists supposed\r\nthe _Amblystoma_ larvæ which produce young to be the adults of a\r\nspecies of salamanders which retained their gills through life, like\r\nthe sirens and mud-puppies, and classified them in a distinct genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--The Western brown eft, or salamander,\r\n_Diemyctylus torosus_. (From living specimen.)]\r\n\r\nOf the various common salamanders or newts some are found in streams,\r\nponds, and ditches, and some under logs and stones in the woods. The\r\naquatic forms have the tail compressed (flattened from side to side),\r\nwhile the land forms have the tail cylindrical, tapering to a point.\r\nMost of the land-salamanders produce their young alive, while the\r\nwater forms lay eggs which are usually attached to a submerged\r\nplant-stem. The salamanders are, almost without exception, found only\r\nin the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n=Frogs and toads (Anura).=--There are about a dozen species of frogs\r\nin the United States. The largest of these, and indeed the largest of\r\nall the frogs, is the well-known bullfrog (_Rana catesbiana_), which\r\nreaches a length (head to posterior end of body) of eight inches. It\r\nis found in ponds and sluggish streams all over eastern United States\r\nand in the Mississippi valley. It is greenish in color with the head\r\nusually bright pale green. Its croaking is very deep and sonorous. The\r\npickerel-frog (_R. palustris_), which is bright brown on the back with\r\ntwo rows of large oblong square blotches of dark brown on the back, is\r\nfound in the mountains of eastern United States. The little pale\r\nreddish-brown wood-frog (_R. sylvatica_) with arms and legs barred\r\nabove is common in damp woods and is \"an almost silent frog.\" The\r\npeculiar and infrequently seen frogs known as the \"spade-foots\"\r\n(_Scaphiopus_) are subterranean in habit and usually live in dry\r\nfields or even on arid plains and deserts. They pass through their\r\ndevelopment and metamorphosis very rapidly, appearing immediately\r\nafter a rain and laying their eggs in temporary pools. At this time of\r\negg-laying they utter extraordinarily loud and strange cries. Some\r\nfrogs in other parts of the world live in trees, and the eggs of one\r\nspecies are deposited on the leaves of trees, leaves which overhang\r\nthe water being selected so that the issuing young may drop into it.\r\n\r\nThe true tree-frogs or tree-toads (Hylidæ) constitute a family\r\nespecially well represented in tropical America. They have little disk-\r\nor pad-like swellings on the tips of their toes to enable them to hold\r\nfirmly to the branches of the trees in which they live. Some, like the\r\nswamp tree-frog and the cricket-frog, are not arboreal in habit,\r\nremaining almost always on the ground. The common tree-frog of the\r\neastern States (_Hyla versicolor_) is green, gray, or brown above with\r\nirregular dark blotches, and yellow below. It croaks or trills,\r\nespecially at evening and in damp weather. Pickering's tree-frog (_Hyla\r\npickeringii_) makes the \"first note of spring\" in the eastern States.\r\nThis tree-frog is the one most frequently heard in the autumn too, but\r\n\"its voice is less vivacious than in the spring and its lonely pipe in\r\ndry woodlands is always associated with goldenrods and asters and\r\nfalling leaves.\" The tree-frogs of North America lay their eggs in the\r\nwater on some fixed object as an aquatic plant, in smaller packets than\r\nthose of the true frogs, and not in strings as do the toads.\r\n\r\nThe toads (Bufonidæ) differ from the true frogs in having no teeth and\r\nin not having, as the frogs do, a cartilaginous process uniting the\r\nshoulder-bones of the two sides of the body. The absence of this\r\nuniting process makes the thoracic region capable of great expansion.\r\nThere are only a few species of toads in North America, but one of\r\nthese species, the common American toad (_Bufo lentiginosus_), is very\r\nabundant and widespread. It appears also in two or three varieties,\r\nthe common toad of the southern States differing in several\r\nparticulars from that of the northern. The toad is a familiar\r\ninhabitant of gardens, and does much good by feeding on noxious\r\ninsects. It is most active at twilight. Its eggs are laid in a single\r\nline in the centre of a long slender gelatinous string or rope, which\r\nis nearly always tangled and wound round some water-plant or stick\r\nnear the shore on the bottom of a pond. The eggs are jet black and\r\nwhen freshly laid are nearly spherical. At the time of egg-laying the\r\ntoads croak or call, making a sort of whistling sound and at the same\r\ntime pronouncing deep in the throat \"bu-rr-r-r-r.\" The toad does not\r\nopen its mouth when croaking, but expands a large sac or resonator in\r\nits throat. The toad-tadpoles are blacker than those of frogs or\r\nsalamanders, and undergo their metamorphosis while of smaller size\r\nthan those of frogs. When they leave the water they travel for long\r\ndistances, hopping along so vigorously that in a few days they may be\r\nas far as a mile from the pond where they were hatched. They conceal\r\nthemselves by day, but will appear after a warm shower; this sudden\r\nappearance of many small toads sometimes gives rise to the false\r\nnotion that they have fallen with the rain.\r\n\r\n=Cœcilians (Gymnophiona).=--The third order of batrachians, the\r\ncœcilians, includes about twenty species of slender worm- or\r\nsnake-like limbless forms which are confined to the tropics. Some of\r\nthem are wholly blind and the others have only rudimentary eyes. In\r\nthem the skin is folded at regular intervals so that the body appears\r\nto be rigid or segmented, and in some species there are small\r\nconcealed horny scales in the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n             BRANCH CHORDATA (_Continued_). CLASS REPTILIA:\r\n                     THE SNAKES, LIZARDS, TURTLES,\r\n                            CROCODILES, ETC.\r\n\r\n                  THE GARTER SNAKE (_Thamnophis_ sp.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Garter snakes may be found almost anywhere during\r\n    the spring and summer months. If possible each student should have a\r\n    specimen, but in case it is difficult to get enough snakes two\r\n    students can use a single specimen. If garter snakes are rare, take\r\n    any other snake. Snakes will live a long time without feeding and\r\n    specimens should be kept alive until ready to use. Kill with\r\n    chloroform as directed for the toad (p. 5). After completing the\r\n    study of the external characters place each specimen in a\r\n    dissecting-pan and with a pair of scissors cut through the scales on\r\n    the ventral side, passing backwards from the eighteenth to the\r\n    fortieth. Pin back the edges of the cut and thus expose the heart.\r\n    Through its lower end, the ventricle, insert a large canula; inject\r\n    with a fairly large syringe the glue mass which is described on p.\r\n    452. This injection will fill the entire arterial system. To inject\r\n    the venous system make another cut through the ventral scales,\r\n    cutting forward from the anal scale through about forty of them.\r\n    Note the injected mass in some of the vessels already filled. Take\r\n    one of the large vessels still containing blood and pass two\r\n    ligatures beneath it. Get ready a small canula and cut a slit in the\r\n    vessel, elevating the head so that the blood will run out as much as\r\n    possible. Now wash the blood off, insert the canula in the slit and\r\n    tie one ligature about the vessel containing the canula; have the\r\n    other ready to tie after the vein has been injected. Use a new color\r\n    for the venous system. Leave specimen in cold water for a time until\r\n    the injection is hard. Then continue the cut from the anal plate\r\n    forward to the lower jaw and pin out the edges of the cut on both\r\n    sides in the dissecting-pan.\r\n\r\n=Structure= (fig. 122).--Note that the snake is covered with horny\r\n_scales_ somewhat as the fish is. How do these scales differ from those\r\nof the fish? In snakes the scales are not bony, but are true skin\r\nstructures. Note the modification of the scales on the head, back, and\r\nventral surface. Those on the dorsal surface often have minute ridges,\r\nthe _keels_. How do the ventral scales differ from the dorsal ones and\r\nothers? By a system of muscles these ventral scales are rhythmically\r\nmoved and as their posterior edges are pushed back against some\r\nresisting object the body glides forward. On the head note the pair of\r\n_eyes_. Are there eyelids? In front of each eye note an opening. What\r\nare these openings? Thrust a bristle into the opening and see where it\r\nenters the mouth-cavity through the _internal nares_. Does the snake\r\nhave external ears? Observe the very long _jaws_ and note that they are\r\nloosely hinged. Examine the inside of the _mouth_. Are there _teeth_? If\r\nso where are they situated, and how arranged? Note that all of the teeth\r\npoint backwards. Food is not chewed. When some object of prey, a frog,\r\nor mouse, for example, is seized, the teeth hold it fast to the roof of\r\nthe mouth and by a backward and forward movement of the lower jaws it is\r\ngradually drawn into the large œsophagus. What is the character and\r\nsituation of the _tongue_? Just behind the tongue note the narrow slit,\r\n_glottis_, opening into the _windpipe_, or _trachea_. Back of the\r\ntrachea opens the _œsophagus_.\r\n\r\nWhen the snake is laid open the elongate _heart_ will be conspicuous\r\nin the anterior third of the body. Insert a blowpipe or quill into the\r\nglottis just back of the tongue, and inflate the _lung_, which is a\r\nlong, thin-walled bag extending from the region of the heart\r\nposteriorly for two-thirds of the length of the body. There is but one\r\ndeveloped lung, the right; note at the anterior end of the lung a\r\nsmall mass of tissue, the atrophied left lung. Running forward from\r\nthe lung is a long tube composed of incomplete cartilaginous rings,\r\nconnected by membrane, the _trachea_. Note the long straight\r\n_alimentary canal_. Distinguish the _œsophagus_, _stomach_,\r\n_intestine_, _rectum_ and the _anus_.\r\n\r\nIn the region of the lung is an elongated dark-red glandular mass, the\r\n_liver_. The secretion from the liver passes down through the long\r\n_hepatic duct_ to the oval-shaped green _gall-bladder_ and into the\r\nintestine.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The bile-duct may be injected through the\r\n    gall-bladder with some colored injecting mass.\r\n\r\nNote that the duct running off from the gall-bladder to the intestine\r\npasses through a pink glandular organ, the _pancreas_. At the anterior\r\nend of the pancreas is a dark-red nodular structure, the _spleen_. The\r\nalimentary canal, the liver and the spleen are all suspended from the\r\ndorsal wall of the body-cavity by a delicate sheet of tissue. What is\r\nthis? This condition we have also noted in the toad and fish.\r\n\r\nToward the posterior end of the body cavity are two long, dark-red\r\nglands, the _kidneys_, which are the principal excretory organs of the\r\nbody. Through a long, slender tube (the _ureter_) each of the kidneys\r\npasses off its wastes. Where do the ureters open?\r\n\r\nAnterior to the kidneys are the reproductive organs. The eggs,\r\nproduced by the female snake, after being fertilized, pass backward\r\nthrough the egg-tubes. During the breeding season these tubes are much\r\ndistended. This is due to the presence of the developing eggs, for the\r\nyoung snakes are hatched in the egg-tubes.\r\n\r\nA successful injection as directed in the first technical note will\r\nhave filled both arterial and venous systems. How does the general\r\nshape of the snake's _heart_ compare with that of the toad? The heart\r\nconsists of two _ventricles_, incompletely separated, and _two\r\nauricles_. In the snake the _conus arteriosus_ is very much shortened\r\nand is not visible. Note two large vessels arising from the median\r\nportion of the ventricle. The one on the left side is the _left aortic\r\nartery_ or _left aortic arch_, while the right gives off two branches.\r\nWhere does the anterior one of these run? The main branch, or _right\r\naortic arch_, passes back to meet its fellow, the left aortic artery,\r\nforming with it the _dorsal aorta_, which runs posteriorly to the end\r\nof the tail. Note the various branches given off by the dorsal aorta\r\nand trace some of them. Arising from the ventricles beneath the two\r\naortic arches is the _pulmonary artery_, which goes to the lung. There\r\nthe blood is purified, after which it is taken up by the _pulmonary\r\nvein_ and carried back to the left auricle, whence it passes into the\r\nventricle to be mixed with the impure blood from the right auricle.\r\nFrom the arteries the blood flows to all parts of the body through\r\nfine _capillaries_, bathing the tissues, giving off oxygen and taking\r\nup the carbonic acid gas. From these capillaries it passes into veins\r\nand so back to the heart; from the anterior end of the body through\r\nthe _jugular veins_ and from the posterior portion of the body through\r\nthe _postcaval vein_. Flowing forward from the tail in the _caudal\r\nvein_, the blood enters the capillaries of the kidneys, where the\r\nwaste matter is taken from it. This part of the circulatory system is\r\nknown as the _renal-portal_ circulation. From the kidneys the blood\r\nflows through the postcaval vein anteriorly to the heart.\r\n\r\nThe blood which passes out from the dorsal aorta to all parts of the\r\nalimentary canal is again collected into veins which unite to form the\r\n_mesenteric vein_. This vein runs to the liver, where it breaks up\r\ninto capillaries. Thence the blood is carried into the postcaval vein,\r\nwhich leads directly to the heart. This part of the circulatory system\r\nwhich collects blood from the alimentary canal and carries it to the\r\nliver is called the _hepatic-portal_ system.\r\n\r\nJust in front of the heart will be noted a nodular structure, the\r\n_thyroid gland_, while a little in advance of the thyroid may be seen\r\na long glandular mass, the _thymus gland_. The functions of these\r\nglands are not certainly understood.\r\n\r\nRemove the alimentary canal and muscles from a part of the body and\r\nnote that the _axial skeleton_, like that of the other vertebrates\r\nstudied, consists of a series of _vertebræ_ placed end to end. Are\r\nthere _arms_ or _legs_? Are _shoulder_ and _pelvic girdles_ present?\r\nHow many of the vertebræ bear _ribs_? The ribs connect at their lower\r\nends with the ventral scales. Note the great number of the vertebræ\r\nand ribs as compared with those of the toad or fish. What are those\r\nvertebræ called which bear no appendages or ribs? Examine carefully\r\nthe elongated _skull_ of the snake, especially the modified jaws. A\r\ndetailed study of the skeleton may be made by referring to the account\r\nof the skeleton of the lizard in Parker's \"Zootomy,\" pp. 130 _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe nervous system may be worked out in a specimen which has been\r\nimmersed in 20 per cent nitric acid. The description of the nervous\r\nsystem of the toad (see pp. 12-13) will suffice for a guide to the\r\nstudy of the nervous system of the snake. The special sense organs, as\r\neyes and ears, should be examined and compared with those of the fish\r\nand toad.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The garter snakes are more or less aquatic\r\nin habit and are good swimmers. They are often found far from water,\r\nbut in greatest abundance where the cat-tails and rushes grow\r\nthickest. They feed on frogs, salamanders, and field-mice, which they\r\nswallow whole. All the garter snakes are ovoviviparous, i.e., hatch\r\neggs within the body-cavity. The eggs, often as many as eighteen or\r\ntwenty, are enclosed within widened portions of the oviducts during\r\nembryonic existence; when the young are born they are able to shift\r\nfor themselves. During cold weather the garter snake hibernates,\r\nhiding then in some gopher-hole, or, in the warmer climates, under\r\nsome log or stone, there to lie dormant until the warm days of spring\r\ncome, when it resumes activity.\r\n\r\nThe garter snake sheds its skin at least once a year, sometimes\r\noftener. This process may be observed in snakes kept in confinement.\r\nFor some time before molting the animal remains torpid, the eyes\r\nbecome milky, and the skin loses its lustre. After a few days it\r\nconceals itself, the skin about the lips and snout pulls away and the\r\nanimal slips out of its entire skin. The snake not only sheds the skin\r\nof the body but also the covering of the eyes. Snakes have no eyelids,\r\nas we have already noted, that which represents the eyelid being a\r\ntransparent membrane which covers the eyeball.\r\n\r\nNo species of the garter snake group is poisonous. Sometimes a garter\r\nsnake may appear to be vicious, but its teeth are very short and at\r\nbest it can only make a small scratch scarcely piercing the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OTHER REPTILES.\r\n\r\nThe class Reptilia includes the lizards, snakes, tortoises, turtles,\r\ncrocodiles, and alligators. Although popularly associated in the common\r\nmind with the batrachians, the reptiles are really more nearly related\r\nto the birds than to the salamanders and frogs. In general shape they\r\nmore nearly resemble the batrachians, but in the structural condition of\r\nthe internal body organs they are more like the birds. They are\r\ncold-blooded, and breathe exclusively by means of lungs, the forms which\r\nlive in water coming to the surface to breathe. They are covered with\r\nhorny scales or plates, which with the entire absence of gills after\r\nhatching readily distinguish them from all the batrachians. While most\r\nreptiles live on land, some inhabit fresh water and some the ocean. As\r\nthe young have the same habitat and general habits as the adult, there\r\nis no such metamorphosis in their life-history as is shown by the\r\nbatrachians. The reptiles are widespread geographically, occurring,\r\nhowever, in greatest abundance in tropical regions, and being wholly\r\nabsent from the Arctic zone. They are not capable of such migrations as\r\nare accomplished by the birds and many mammals, but withstand severely\r\nhot or cold seasons by passing into a state of suspended animation or\r\nseasonal sleep or torpor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--A lizard in the grass. (Photograph from life\r\nby Cherry Kearton; permission of Cassell & Co.)]\r\n\r\n=Body form and organization.=--The chief variations in body form among\r\nthe reptiles are manifest when a turtle, lizard, and snake are compared.\r\nIn the turtles, the body is short, flattened, and heavy, and provided\r\nalways with four limbs, each terminating in a five-toed foot; in the\r\nlizards the body is more elongate and with usually four legs, but\r\nsometimes with two only, or even none at all; while in the snakes the\r\nlong, slender, cylindrical body is legless or at most has mere rudiments\r\nof the hinder limbs. With the reptiles locomotion is as often effected\r\nby the bending or serpentine movements of the trunk as by the use of\r\nlegs. Among lizards and snakes the body is covered with horny epidermal\r\nscales or plates, while among the turtles and crocodiles there may be,\r\nin addition to the epidermal plates, a real deposit of bone in the skin\r\nwhereby the effectiveness of the armor is increased. The epidermal\r\ncovering of snakes and lizards is periodically molted, or, as we say,\r\nthe skin is shed. The bright colors and patterns of snakes and of many\r\nlizards are due to the presence and arrangement of pigment-cells in the\r\nskin. Among some reptiles, notably the chameleons, the colors and\r\nmarkings can be quickly and radically changed by an automatic change in\r\nthe tension of the skin.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=--In reptiles, as in batrachians, the chief variations in\r\nthe body skeleton are correlated with differences in external body\r\nform. In the short compact body of the turtles and tortoises the\r\nnumber of vertebræ is much smaller than in the snakes. Some turtles\r\nhave only 34 vertebræ; certain snakes as many as 400. The reptilian\r\nskull, in the number and disposition of its parts and in the manner of\r\nits attachment to the spinal column, resembles that of the birds,\r\nalthough the cranial bones remain separate, not fusing as in the\r\nbirds. In the snake the two halves of the lower jaw are not fused in\r\nfront but are united by elastic ligaments, which condition, together\r\nwith the extremely mobile articulation of the base of the jaws, allows\r\nthe snakes to open their mouths so as to take in bodies of great size.\r\nAll of the reptiles, except the turtles, are provided with small teeth\r\nwhich serve, generally, for seizing or holding prey and not for\r\nmastication. The poisonous snakes have one or more long, sharp, and\r\ngrooved or hollow fangs (fig. 131). In the legless reptiles both\r\nshoulder and pelvic girdles may be wholly lacking; in the limbed forms\r\nboth girdles are more or less well developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--Dissection of the garter snake, _Thamnophis_\r\nsp.]\r\n\r\nThe tongue of many reptiles, notably the snakes, is bifid or forked,\r\nand is an extremely mobile and sensitive organ. The œsophagus is long\r\nand in the snakes can be stretched very wide so as to permit the\r\nswallowing of large animals whole. Reptiles breathe solely by lungs,\r\nof which there is a pair. They are simple and sac-like, the left lung\r\nbeing often much smaller than the other. In turtles and crocodiles the\r\nlungs are divided internally by septa into a number of chambers.\r\nBecause of the rigidity of the carapace or \"box\" of turtles the air\r\ncannot be taken in the ordinary way by the use of the ribs and\r\nrib-muscles, but has to be swallowed. The reptilian heart consists of\r\ntwo distinct auricles and of two ventricles, which in most reptiles\r\nare only incompletely divided, the division into right and left\r\nventricles being complete only among the crocodiles and alligators,\r\nthe most highly organized of living reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe organs of the nervous system reach a considerable degree of\r\ndevelopment in the animals of this class. The brain in size and\r\ncomplexity is plainly superior to the batrachian brain and resembles\r\nquite closely that of birds. Of the organs of special sense those of\r\ntouch are limited to special papillæ in the skin of certain snakes and\r\nmany lizards. Taste seems to be little developed, but olfactory organs\r\nof considerable complexity are present in most forms, and consist of a\r\npair of nostrils with olfactory papillæ on their inner surfaces. The\r\nears vary much in degree of organization, crocodiles and alligators\r\nbeing the only reptiles with a well-defined outer ear. This consists\r\nof a dermal flap covering a tympanum. Eyes are always present and are\r\nhighly developed. They resemble the eyes of birds in many particulars.\r\nAll reptiles, excepting the snakes and a few lizards, have movable\r\neyelids, including a nictitating membrane like that of the birds. With\r\nthe snakes the eye is protected by the outer skin, which remains\r\nintact over it, but is transparent and thickened to form a lens just\r\nover the inner eye. Turtles and lizards have a ring of bony plates\r\nsurrounding the eyes similar to that of the birds. In addition to the\r\nusual eyes there is in many lizards a remarkable eye-like organ, the\r\nso-called pineal eye, which is situated in the roof of the cranium,\r\nand is believed to be the vestige of a true third eye, which in\r\nancient reptiles was probably a well-developed organ.\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--Most reptiles lay eggs from which the young\r\nhatch after a longer or shorter period of incubation. Usually the eggs\r\nare simply dropped on the ground in suitable places (although certain\r\nturtles dig holes in which to deposit them), where they are incubated by\r\nthe general warmth of the air and ground. However, some of the giant\r\nsnakes, the pythons for instance, hold the eggs in the folds of the\r\nbody. In the case of some snakes and lizards the eggs are retained in\r\nthe body of the mother until the young hatch; such reptiles are said to\r\nbe ovoviviparous, because the young, although born alive, are in reality\r\nenclosed in an egg until the moment of birth. Among reptiles the newly\r\nhatched young resemble the parents in most respects except in size, yet\r\nstriking differences in coloration and pattern are not rare. But there\r\nis in this class no metamorphosis such as characterizes the\r\npost-embryonic development of the batrachians.\r\n\r\nThe food of reptiles consists almost exclusively of animal substance,\r\nalthough some species, notably the green turtles and certain\r\nland-tortoises, are vegetable-feeders. The animal-feeders are mostly\r\npredaceous, the smaller species catching worms and insects, while the\r\nlarger forms capture fishes, frogs, birds, and their eggs, small\r\nmammals, and other reptiles.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The living Reptilia are divided into four orders, of\r\nwhich one includes only a single genus, _Hatteria_, a peculiar lizard\r\nfound in New Zealand. The other three are the Squamata, which includes\r\nthe lizards and snakes,[17] distinguished by the scaly covering of the\r\nbody, the Chelonia, which includes the tortoises and turtles,\r\ndistinguished by the shell of bony plates which encloses the body, and\r\nthe Crocodilia, which includes the crocodiles and alligators, whose\r\nbodies are covered with rows of sculptured bony scutes.\r\n\r\n    =Tortoises and turtles (Chelonia).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Obtain\r\n    specimens of some pond- or land-turtle common in the vicinity of\r\n    the school. The red-bellied and yellow-bellied terrapins\r\n    (_Pseudemys_) or the painted or mud-turtles (_Chrysemys_) are\r\n    common over most of the United States. (_Pseudemys_ is found south\r\n    of the Ohio River and _Chrysemys_ north of it.) They may be raked\r\n    up from creek-bottoms or fished for with strong hook and line,\r\n    using meat as bait. They will live through the winter if kept in a\r\n    cool place, without food or special care of any kind. Observe\r\n    their swimming and diving, the retraction of head and limbs into\r\n    the shell, the use of the third eyelid (nictitating membrane), and\r\n    the swallowing of air.\r\n\r\n    Examine the external structure of a dead specimen (kill by\r\n    thrusting a bit of cotton soaked with chloroform or ether into\r\n    the windpipe; see opening just at base of tongue). Note shell\r\n    consisting of a dorsal plate, the carapace, and ventral plate,\r\n    the plastron, and the lateral uniting parts, the bridge. Note\r\n    legs, and head with horny beak but no teeth. Compare with snake.\r\n    The examination of the internal structure of the turtle can be\r\n    readily made by sawing through the bridge on either side and\r\n    removing the plastron. Note the ligaments which attach the\r\n    plastron to the shoulder and pelvic girdles. Note muscles\r\n    covering these bones. Note just behind the shoulder girdle the\r\n    heart (perhaps still pulsating) and the dark liver on each side\r\n    of it. Work out the alimentary canal, the trachea and lungs, and\r\n    other principal organs, comparing them with those of the snake.\r\n    The skeleton can be studied by dissecting and boiling and\r\n    brushing away the flesh which still adheres to the bones. The\r\n    comparison of the skeleton of the turtle with that of the snake\r\n    is very instructive; marked differences in the skeletons of the\r\n    two kinds of reptiles are obviously correlated with the\r\n    differences in habits and shape of body. Note in the skeleton of\r\n    the turtle especially the shoulder and pelvic girdles and limbs\r\n    (absent in the snake) and small number of vertebræ and ribs.\r\n\r\nAmong the common turtles and tortoises of the United States are\r\nseveral species of soft-shelled turtles (Trionychidæ) with carapace\r\nnot completely ossified and both carapace and plastron covered by a\r\nthick leathery skin which is flexible at the margins; the\r\nsnapping-turtle (_Chelydra serpentina_), common in streams and ponds,\r\nwith shell high in front and low behind and head and tail long and not\r\ncapable of being withdrawn into the shell; the red-bellied and\r\nyellow-bellied terrapins (_Pseudemys_), red and yellow, with\r\ngreenish-brown and black markings, common on the ground in woods and\r\namong rocks and also near water and sometimes in it; the pond- or\r\nmud-turtle (_Chrysemys_), also brightly colored and usually confined\r\nto ponds and pond-shores; and the box-tortoise (_Cistudo carolina_),\r\ncommon in woods and upland pastures and readily recognizable by its\r\nability to enclose itself completely in its shell by the closing down\r\nof the lids of the plastron. All of these fresh-water and land-turtles\r\nexcept the soft-shelled turtles belong to one family, the Emydidæ, but\r\nhave somewhat diverse habits. Most of them are carnivorous, but few\r\ncatch any very active prey. While some are strictly aquatic, others\r\nare as strictly terrestrial, never entering the water. The eggs of all\r\nare oblong and are deposited in hollows, sometimes covered in sand.\r\nThe newly hatched young are usually circular in shape, and vary in\r\ncolor and pattern from the parents.\r\n\r\nThe \"diamond-back terrapin\" (_Malaclemmys palustris_), used for food,\r\nis a salt-water form \"inhabiting the marshes along the Atlantic coast\r\nfrom Massachusetts to Texas. About Charleston [and Baltimore] they are\r\nvery abundant and are captured in large numbers for market, especially\r\nat the breeding season, when the females are full of eggs. Further\r\nnorth they are dug from the salt mud early in their hibernation and\r\nare greatly esteemed, being fat and savory.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--The giant land-tortoise of the Galapagos\r\nIslands, _Testudo_ sp. These tortoises reach a length of four feet.\r\n(Photograph from life by Geo. Coleman.)]\r\n\r\nStrongly contrasting with the usually small land- and fresh-water\r\nturtles are the great sea-turtles, such as the leather-back, the\r\nloggerhead and the green turtles. Some of these animals reach a length\r\nof six feet and more and a weight of nine hundred pounds, and have the\r\nfeet compressed and fin-shaped for swimming. They live in the open\r\nocean, coming on land only to lay their eggs, which are buried in the\r\nsand of ocean islands. These egg-laying visits are almost always made at\r\nnight, and the turtles are then often caught by \"turtlers.\" The flesh of\r\nmost of the sea-turtles is used for food, and from the shell of certain\r\nspecies, notably the \"hawk-bill\" (_Eretmochelys imbricata_) the\r\nbeautiful \"tortoise-shell\" used for making combs and other articles is\r\nobtained. The common green turtle (_Chelonia mydas_) of the Atlantic\r\ncoast is the species most prized for food. It is a vegetarian, feeding\r\non the roots of _Zostera_, the plant known in New England as eel-grass,\r\nthough farther south it is called turtle-grass. When grazing the\r\nturtles eat only the roots, the tops thus rising to the surface, where\r\nthey indicate to the turtler the animal's whereabouts. The turtler,\r\narmed with a strong steel barb attached to a rope and loosely fitted to\r\nthe end of a pole, carefully rows up to the unsuspecting animal, and\r\nwith a strong thrust plunges the barb through its shell, withdraws the\r\npole, and, grasping the rope, now firmly attached to the turtle's back,\r\nlifts the animal to the surface. Here, with assistance, he turns it into\r\nthe boat, where it is rendered helpless by being thrown on its back and\r\nby having its flippers tied. These turtles are also caught on their\r\nbreeding-grounds, being found on the sand at night by the turtler,\r\nturned over on their backs, and left thus securely caught until\r\nassistance comes to help get them into the boats.\r\n\r\n    =Snakes and lizards (Squamata).=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--A snake has\r\n    already been dissected and studied. It will be instructive to\r\n    compare the external structures, at least, of a lizard with that of\r\n    the snake. Specimens of some species of the common swift\r\n    (_Sceloporus_) are obtainable almost anywhere in the United States.\r\n    The \"pine-lizards\" of the east belong to this genus. Lizards may be\r\n    sought for in woods, along fences, and especially on warm rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--The blue-tailed skink, _Eumeces\r\nskeltonianus_. (From living specimen.)]\r\n\r\nThe group of lizards is a very large one, about 1,500 species being\r\nknown, but it is represented in the United States by comparatively few\r\nspecies. Lizards are especially abundant in the tropics of South\r\nAmerica. The strange and fantastic appearance presented by some of\r\nthem has made certain species the object of much interest and often\r\nfear on the part of the natives of tropical lands. In those regions\r\nare current extraordinary stories and beliefs regarding the habits and\r\nattributes of certain lizards like the basilisk and chameleon. Lizards\r\nare all more or less elongate and some are truly snake-like in form.\r\nThe legs, though usually present and functional, are in many cases\r\nmuch reduced, and in some forms, as the glass-snake, either one or\r\nboth pairs are so rudimentary as to have no external projection\r\nwhatever. Although lizards are often regarded as being poisonous, only\r\none genus, _Heloderma_, the Gila Monster, is really so. All others are\r\nperfectly harmless as far as poison is concerned, and most of them are\r\nunusually timid. They vary in size from a few inches to six feet in\r\nlength. Most of them are terrestrial, some arboreal, and some aquatic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--The Gila monster, _Heloderma horridum_, the\r\nonly poisonous lizard. (Photograph from life by J. O. Snyder.)]\r\n\r\nAmong the lizards of this country the swifts and ground-lizards are\r\nfamiliar everywhere. In certain regions the glass-snake or joint-snake\r\n(_Opheosaurus ventralis_) is common. This animal, popularly considered\r\nto be a snake, has no external limbs, and its tail is so brittle, the\r\nvertebræ composing it being very fragile, that part of it may break off\r\nat the slightest blow. In time a new tail is regenerated. It lives in\r\nthe central and northern part of the United States, and burrows in dry\r\nplaces. In the western part of the country horned toads (_Phrynosoma_)\r\nare common, about ten different species being known. These are lizards\r\nwith shortened and depressed body and well-developed legs. The body is\r\ncovered with protective spiny protuberances, and in individual color\r\nand pattern resembles closely the soil, rocks, and cactus among which\r\nthe particular horned toad lives. All the species of _Phrynosoma_ are\r\nviviparous, seven or eight young being born alive at a time.\r\n\r\nIn New Mexico, Arizona, and northern Mexico the only existing poisonous\r\nlizards, the Gila Monster (_Heloderma_) (fig. 126) is found. This is a\r\nheavy, deep-black, orange-mottled lizard about sixteen inches long.\r\nThere is much variance of belief among people regarding the Gila\r\nMonster, but recent experiments have proved the poisonous nature of the\r\nanimal. The poison which is secreted by glands in the lower jaw flows\r\nalong the grooved teeth into the wound. A beautiful and interesting\r\nlittle lizard found in the South is the green chameleon (_Anolis\r\nprincipalis_). Its body is about three inches long with a slender tail\r\nof five or six inches. The normal color of the chameleon is grass-green,\r\nbut it may \"assume almost instantly shades varying from a beautiful\r\nemerald to a dark and iridescent bronze color.\"\r\n\r\nIn the tropics many of the lizards reach great size and are of strange\r\nshape and patterns. The flying dragons (_Draco_) have a sort of\r\nparachute on each side of the body composed of a fold of skin\r\nsupported by five or six false posterior ribs. These lizards live in\r\nthe trees of the East Indies and \"fly\" or sail from tree to tree. They\r\nare very beautifully colored. The iguanas (_Iguana_) of the tropics of\r\nSouth America are commonly used for food. They live mostly in trees,\r\nand reach a length of five or six feet. The monitor (_Varanus\r\nniloticus_) is a great water-lizard that lives in the Nile, and feeds\r\non crocodiles' eggs, of which it destroys great numbers. It is the\r\nprincipal enemy of the crocodile. When full grown it reaches a length\r\nof six feet or even more.\r\n\r\nAbout 1,000 living species of snakes are known. Usually they have the\r\nbody regularly cylindrical, and without distinct division into body\r\nregions. Legs are wanting, locomotion being effected by the help of\r\nthe scales and the ribs. No snake can move forward on a perfectly\r\nsmooth surface and no snake can leap. In some forms, such as the\r\npythons, external rudiments of the hind limbs are present, but do not\r\naid in locomotion. The mouth is large and distensible so that prey of\r\nconsiderably greater size than the normal diameter of the snake's body\r\nis frequently swallowed whole. The sense of taste is very little if at\r\nall developed, as the food is swallowed without mastication. The\r\ntongue, which is protrusible and usually red or blue-black, serves as\r\na special organ of touch. Hearing is poor, the ears being very little\r\ndeveloped. The sense of sight is also probably not at all keen. Snakes\r\nrely chiefly on the sense of smell for finding their prey and their\r\nmates. The colors of snakes are often brilliant, and in many cases\r\nserve to produce an effective protective resemblance by harmonizing\r\nwith the usual surroundings of the animal. The food of snakes consists\r\nalmost exclusively of other animals, which are caught alive. Some of\r\nthe poisonous snakes kill their prey before swallowing it, as do some\r\nof the constrictors. While most snakes live on the ground, some are\r\nsemi-arboreal and others spend part or all of their time in water.\r\nCold-region snakes spend the winter in a state of suspended animation;\r\nin the tropics, on the contrary, the hottest part of the year is spent\r\nby some species in a similar \"sleep.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--A garter snake, _Thamnophis parietalis_.\r\n(Photograph from life by J. O. Snyder.)]\r\n\r\nThere are so many common snakes in the United States that only a few\r\nof the more familiar forms can be mentioned. The non-poisonous species\r\nof America belong to the family Colubridæ, while all but one of the\r\npoisonous species belong to the family Crotalidæ, characterized by the\r\npresence of a pair of erectile poison-fangs on the upper jaw. Among\r\nthe commonest of the Colubridæ are the garter snakes (_Thamnophis_)\r\n(fig. 127), always striped and not more than three feet long. The most\r\nwidespread species is _Thamnophis sirtalis_, rather dully colored with\r\nthree series of small dark spots along each side. The common\r\nwater-snake (_Natrix sipedon_) is brownish with back and sides each\r\nwith a series of about 80 large square dark blotches alternating with\r\neach other. It feeds on fishes and frogs, and although \"unpleasant and\r\nill-tempered\" is harmless. One of the prettiest and most gentle of\r\nsnakes is the familiar little greensnake (_Cyclophis æstivus_), common\r\nin the East and South in moist meadows and in bushes near the water.\r\nIt feeds on insects and can be easily kept alive in confinement. A\r\nfamiliar larger snake is the blacksnake or blue racer (_Bascaniom\r\nconstrictor_), \"lustrous pitch black, general color greenish below and\r\nwith white throat.\" It is \"often found in the neighborhood of water,\r\nand is particularly partial to thickets of alders, where it can hunt\r\nfor toads, mice, and birds, and being an excellent climber it is often\r\nseen among the branches of small trees and bushes, hunting for young\r\nbirds in the nest.\" The chain-snake (_Lampropeltis getulus_) of the\r\nsoutheast and the king-snake (also a _Lampropeltis_) (fig. 128) of the\r\ncentral States are beautiful lustrous black-and-yellow spotted snakes\r\nwhich feed not only on lizards, salamanders, small birds and mice but\r\nalso on other snakes. The king-snake should be protected in regions\r\ninfested by \"rattlers.\" The spreading adder or blowing viper\r\n(_Heterodon platirhinos_), a common snake in the eastern States,\r\nbrownish or reddish with dark dorsal and lateral blotches, depresses\r\nand expands the head when angry, hissing and threatening. Despite the\r\npopular belief in its poisonous nature this ugly reptile is quite\r\nharmless. It specially infests dry sandy places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--A king-snake, _Lampropeltis boylii_.\r\n(Photograph from life by J. O. Snyder.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--The gopher-snake, _Pituophis bellona_.\r\n(Photograph from life by J. O. Snyder.)]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the coral or beadsnake (_Elaps fulvius_), a\r\nrather small jet-black snake with seventeen broad yellow-bordered\r\ncrimson rings, found in the southern States, the only poisonous snakes\r\nof the United States are the rattlesnakes and their immediate\r\nrelatives, the copperhead and water-moccasin. These snakes all have a\r\nlarge triangular head, and the posterior tip of the body is, in the\r\nrattlesnakes, provided with a \"rattle\" composed of a series of partly\r\noverlapping thin horny capsules or cones of shape as shown in figure\r\n130. These horny pieces are simply the somewhat modified successively\r\nformed epidermal coverings of the tip of the body, which instead of\r\nbeing entirely molted as the rest of the skin is, are, because of\r\ntheir peculiar shape, loosely attached to one another, and by the\r\nbasal one to the body of the snake. The number of rattles does not\r\ncorrespond to the snake's years for several reasons, partly because\r\nmore than one rattle can be added to the tail in a year, and\r\nespecially because rattles are easily and often broken off. As many as\r\nthirty rattles have been found on one snake. There are two species of\r\nground-rattlesnakes or massasaugas (_Sistrurus_) in the United States\r\nand ten species of the true rattlesnakes (_Crotalus_). The centre of\r\ndistribution of the rattlesnakes is the dry tablelands of the\r\nsouthwest in New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. But there are few\r\nlocalities in the United States outside the high mountains in which\r\n\"rattlers\" do not occur or did not occur before they were exterminated\r\nby man. The copperhead (_Agkistrodon contortix_) is light chestnut in\r\ncolor, with inverted Y-shaped darker blotches on the sides, and\r\nseldom exceeds three feet in length. It occurs in the eastern and\r\nmiddle United States from Pennsylvania and Nebraska southward. It is a\r\nvicious and dangerous snake, striking without warning. The\r\nwater-moccasin (_Agkistrodon piscivorous_) is dark chestnut-brown with\r\ndarker markings. The head is purplish black above. It is found along\r\nthe Atlantic and Gulf coasts from North Carolina to Mexico, extending\r\nalso some distance up the Mississippi valley. It is distinctively a\r\nwater-snake, being found in damp swampy places or actually in water.\r\nIt reaches a length of over four feet and is a very venomous snake,\r\nstriking on the slightest provocation. The common harmless water-snake\r\nis often called water-moccasin in the southern States, being popularly\r\nconfounded with this most dangerous of our serpents. The poison of all\r\nof these snakes is a rather yellowish, transparent, sticky fluid\r\nsecreted by glands in the head, from which it flows through the hollow\r\nmaxillary fangs. The character and position of the fangs are shown in\r\nfigure 131. Remedial measures for the bite of poisonous snakes are,\r\nfirst, to stop, if possible, the flow of blood from the wound to the\r\nheart, by compressing the veins between the wound and heart, then to\r\nsuck (if the lips are unbroken) the poison from the wound, next to\r\nintroduce by hypodermic injection permanganate of potash, bichloride\r\nof mercury or chromic acid into the wound, and finally perhaps to take\r\nsome strong stimulant as brandy or whiskey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--The rattles of the rattlesnake; the lower\r\nfigure shows a longitudinal section of the rattle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--Dissection of head of rattlesnake; _f_,\r\npoison-fangs; _p_, poison-sac.]\r\n\r\nOf the kinds of snakes not found in this country perhaps the most\r\ninteresting are the gigantic boa constrictors, anacondas, and pythons.\r\nPythons are found in India, the islands of the Malay archipelago, and\r\nAustralia, while the boas and anacondas live in the tropics of America.\r\nThe largest pythons reach a length of thirty feet and some of the boas\r\nare nearly as large. These snakes feed on small mammals such as fawns,\r\nkids, water-rats, etc., and birds. The prey is swallowed whole, being\r\nfirst encircled and crushed to death in folds of the body. After a meal\r\nthe python or boa lies in a sort of torpor for some time. A famous snake\r\nis the deadly cobra-da-capello of India. These snakes are so abundant\r\nand the bite is so nearly certainly fatal that thousands of persons are\r\nkilled each year in India by it. Other extremely poisonous snakes are\r\nthe vipers (_Vipera cerastes_), which live in the hot deserts of\r\nnorthern Africa. Over each eye there is a scaly spine or horn, from\r\nwhich the name horned viper is derived. The most poisonous snake of\r\nSouth Africa is the large and ugly puff-adder, which puffs itself up\r\nwhen irritated. An interesting group of snakes is that of the Hydrophidæ\r\nor sea-snakes, which swim on the surface of the ocean by means of their\r\nflattened and oar-like tails. These forms live in the tropical portions\r\nof the Indian and Pacific oceans, ranging as far north as the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia, and spend their whole life in the water, \"out of which they\r\nappear to be blind and soon die.\" They are extremely venomous, but are\r\nall of small size, rarely two feet long.\r\n\r\n=Crocodiles and alligators (Crocodilia).=--The crocodiles and\r\nalligators are reptiles familiar by name and appearance, though seen\r\nin nature only by inhabitants or visitors in tropical and semitropical\r\nlands. In the United States there are two species of these great\r\nreptiles, the American crocodile (_Crocodilus americanus_), living in\r\nthe West Indies and South America and occasionally found in Florida,\r\nand the American alligator (_Alligator mississippiensis_), common in\r\nthe morasses and stagnant pools of the southern States. The alligator\r\ndiffers from the crocodiles in having a broader snout. It is rarely\r\nmore than twelve feet long. The best-known crocodile is the Nile\r\ncrocodile, which is not limited to the Nile, but is found throughout\r\nAfrica. In the Ganges of India is found another member of this group\r\nof reptiles called the gavial. It is among the largest of the order,\r\nreaching a length of twenty feet. The crocodiles, alligators, and\r\ngavials comprise not more than a score of species altogether, but\r\nbecause of their wide distribution, great size, and carnivorous habits\r\nthey are among the most conspicuous of the larger living animals. They\r\nlive mostly in the water, going on land to sun themselves or to lay\r\ntheir eggs. They move very quickly and swiftly in water but are\r\nawkward on land. Fish, aquatic mammals and other animals which\r\noccasionally visit the water are their prey. The gavial and Nile\r\ncrocodile are both known to attack and devour human beings, and these\r\nspecies annually cause a considerable loss of life. But few such\r\nfatalities, however, are accredited to the American alligator.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[17] By many zoologists the lizards and snakes are held to form two\r\ndistinct orders, Lacertilia and Ophidia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n               BRANCH CHORDATA (_Continued_). CLASS AVES:\r\n                               THE BIRDS\r\n\r\n               THE ENGLISH SPARROW (_Passer domesticus_)\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The English sparrow may be found now in cities and\r\n    villages all over the United States. It has become a veritable pest,\r\n    and the killing of the few needed for the laboratory may be looked\r\n    on as desirable rather than deplorable, as is the killing of birds\r\n    in almost all other cases. The males have a black throat, with the\r\n    other head-markings strong and contrasting (black, brown, and\r\n    white), while the females have a uniform grayish and brownish\r\n    coloration on the head.\r\n\r\n    Specimens are best taken alive, as shooting usually injures them\r\n    for dissection. One can rely on the ingenuity of the boys of the\r\n    class to procure a sufficient number of specimens. Observations on\r\n    the habits of the birds should be made by the pupils as they go to\r\n    and from school. For dissection use fresh specimens if possible. If\r\n    desirable a pigeon or dove may be used in place of the sparrow.\r\n\r\n=External structure.=--Note in the sparrow the same general arrangement\r\nof body parts as in the toad, the body being divided into _head_, _upper\r\nlimbs_, _trunk_, and _lower limbs_. In the toad, however, all of the\r\nlimbs are fitted for walking and jumping, whereas in the sparrow the\r\nanterior pair of appendages, the _wings_, are modified to be organs of\r\nflight, and the posterior limbs are specially adapted for perching. Note\r\nthat the sparrow is covered with _feathers_, some long, some short, in\r\nsome places thick and in others thin, but all fitting together to form a\r\ncomplete covering for the body. Note also that the anterior end of the\r\nhead is prolonged into a hard bony structure, the _bill_, covered with\r\nhorny substance. This horny substance together with the feathers and\r\nhorny covering of the feet are modified portions of the skin. Note the\r\nlong _quill-feathers_ attached to the posterior edge of the wing. By\r\nthese the bird sustains its flight. Other long quill-feathers are\r\nattached to the posterior end of the body, forming the _tail_. By a\r\nsystem of muscles connected with these feathers they act together,\r\nserving as a rudder during flight and as a balancing contrivance when\r\nperching. Note just above the bill two openings protected by tufts of\r\nfeathers. What are these openings? How are they connected with the\r\n_mouth_? Note the large _eyes_, and at the inner angle of each the\r\ndelicate _nictitating membrane_ which can be drawn over the ball. Does\r\nthe bird have external _ears_? Lift the feathers just above the tail\r\n(the upper tail-coverts) and note a small median gland, the _oil-gland_,\r\nfrom which the bird derives the oil with which it oils its feathers.\r\nBeneath the tail note the opening from the alimentary canal and from the\r\nkidneys and reproductive organs. This is called the _cloacal opening_.\r\n\r\nExamine in detail some of the feathers. In one of the quill-feathers\r\nnote the central _stem_ or _shaft_ composed of two parts, a basal\r\nhollow _quill_, which bears no web and by which the feather is\r\ninserted in the skin, and a longer, terminal, four-sided portion, the\r\n_rachis_, which bears on either side a _web_ or _vane_. Each vane is\r\ncomposed of many narrow linear plates, the _barbs_, from which rise\r\n(like miniature vanes) many _barbules_. Each barbule bears many fine\r\n_barbicels_ and _hamuli_ or _hooklets_. The barbs of the feather are\r\ninterlocked. How is this effected? The feathers which overlie the\r\nwhole body and bear the color pattern are called _contour-feathers_.\r\nHow do they differ from or correspond with the quill-feathers in\r\nstructure? Soft feathers called _down-feathers_ or _plumules_, cover\r\nthe body more or less completely, being, however, mostly hidden by\r\nthe contour-feathers; the barbs of these are sometimes not borne on a\r\nrachis, but arise as a tuft from the end of the quill. Certain other\r\nfeathers which have an extremely slender stem and usually no vane,\r\nexcept a small terminal tuft of barbs, are called _thread-feathers_,\r\nor _filoplumules_. They are rather long, but are mostly hidden by the\r\ncontour-feathers. In certain birds they stand out conspicuously, as\r\nthe _vibrissæ_ about the nostrils.\r\n\r\nIn the determination of birds by the use of a classificatory \"key\" (see\r\np. 359) it is necessary to be familiar with the names applied to the\r\nvarious external regions of the body and plumage, and with the terms\r\nused to denote the special varying conditions of these parts. By\r\nreference to figure 133 the names of the regions or parts most commonly\r\nreferred to may be learned. A full account of all of the external\r\ncharacters with definitions of the various terms used in referring to\r\nthem may be found in Coues's \"Key to North American Birds.\"\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Pull the feathers from the body, being careful\r\n    not to tear the skin.\r\n\r\nIn the fish and toad, already studied, the head is closely joined to\r\nthe trunk. How is it with the bird? Observe that the _knee_ of the\r\nsparrow is covered by feathers and that it is the _ankle_ which\r\nextends down as the bare unfeathered part to the _digits_. How many\r\ndigits have the feet of the bird? How are they arranged?\r\n\r\n    =Internal structure= (fig. 132).--TECHNICAL NOTE.--With a pair of\r\n    scissors cut just beneath the skin anteriorly from the cloacal\r\n    opening to the angle of the lower jaw. Pin the sparrow on its back\r\n    by the wings, feet, and bill. Push back the skin from both sides\r\n    and pin out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--Diagrammatic outline of bird's body with\r\nnames of external parts and regions.]\r\n\r\nNote the large powerful _pectoral muscles_. Note a hard median\r\nprojection of bone, the _sternum_, which is a large keel-shaped bone\r\nwith lateral expansions to which are attached the _ribs_. Where are\r\nthe largest and most powerful muscles of the toad located? Where are\r\nthey in the fish? In the bird the most powerful muscles are these\r\npectoral muscles, which move the wings in flight.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Cut the pectoral muscles from the left side of\r\n    the sternum, push back and pin to one side. With a strong pair of\r\n    scissors cut through the ribs on the left side of the sternum and\r\n    through the overlying bones. Lift the whole sternum, with the\r\n    right pectoral muscle attached, to the left side of the pan and\r\n    pin it down. Cut through the membrane which covers the viscera and\r\n    cover the dissection with water.\r\n\r\nIn this operation note the V-shaped _wishbone_ in front of the\r\nsternum. It is composed of the two _clavicles_ with their inner ends\r\nfused. Note the stout _coracoid_ bones extending from the anterior end\r\nof the sternum to the shoulder.\r\n\r\nNote near the middle of the body the _heart_ with the large\r\nblood-vessels proceeding from it. Behind the heart lies the large\r\nreddish-brown _liver_, and on the left side below the liver is the\r\nlarge _gizzard_ or _muscular stomach_. Note the _viscera_ folded over\r\nthemselves in the body-cavity. Push them temporarily aside and note in\r\nthe dorsal region under the heart large pinkish spongy sacs, the\r\n_lungs_. These are attached by short tubes, the _bronchi_, to the long\r\ncartilaginous _trachea_. At the union of the bronchi with the trachea\r\nis a small expansion with cartilaginous walls, within which are\r\nstretched small bands of muscles. This organ is the _syrinx_, the\r\nsong- or voice-apparatus of the bird. It should be cut open and\r\ncarefully examined. Trace the trachea forward to its anterior end. It\r\nopens by a _glottis_ into the _larynx_, a slightly swollen chamber\r\nwith cartilaginous walls. Note the U-shaped _hyoid bone_ surrounding\r\nthe front of the glottis. Through a blowpipe or quill inserted into\r\nthe glottis blow air into the trachea and observe the inflation of the\r\nlungs and of certain large _air-sacs_ in the abdomen, which\r\ncommunicate with them.\r\n\r\nBeneath the trachea note the long _œsophagus_. Inflate the œsophagus\r\nwith a blowpipe and note how distensible is its lower end near the\r\nbreast. This distensible portion is called the _crop_. If the\r\nalimentary canal be drawn out straight the œsophagus will be found to\r\nrun as an almost straight tube down the left side of the body to the\r\ngizzard. This latter organ has very thick muscular walls and in it the\r\nfood is ground up among the small bits of gravel it contains.\r\nExtending from the gizzard near the entrance of the œsophagus note the\r\nlong _pyloric loop_ of the intestine called _duodenum_. Within this\r\nloop is a long pinkish gland, the _pancreas_, which empties by a duct\r\ninto the duodenum. Into the duodenum also the overlying liver empties\r\nits secretion of bile from the median-placed _gall-bladder_. From the\r\nduodenum the _small intestine_ or _ileum_ extends with many\r\nconvolutions to its exit through the cloacal aperture. On the\r\nintestine near the cloacal opening note a pair of glandular\r\nstructures, the _cæca_. The short part of intestine between the cæca\r\nand cloaca is called the _rectum_. On the left side of the body\r\nbeneath the gizzard note a dark glandular structure, the _spleen_.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the dissection as so far worked out.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Remove the alimentary canal, cutting it free\r\n    posteriorly at the cæca and anteriorly just above the muscular\r\n    gizzard. Cut open the gizzard and note its structure. The contained\r\n    sand and gravel grains are picked up by the bird as it eats.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the throat note the well-defined _thyroid gland_; in\r\nyoung sparrows will be noted on each side of the neck a mass of tissue,\r\nthe remains of the _thymus gland_, which disappears in the adult.\r\n\r\nCut transversely through the lower end of the heart and note that the\r\nventricles are wholly distinct, whereas in the toad and snake they are\r\nincompletely separated. In the bird there is a complete double\r\ncirculation. Its blood is not mixed, the pure with the impure, as in\r\nthe toad and snake. Blood passing through the _right auricle_ and\r\n_ventricle_ goes to the lungs; on its return to the heart purified, it\r\nenters the _left auricle_ and _left ventricle_ thence to pass out over\r\nthe body through the arteries.\r\n\r\nNote the large _aorta_ given off from the left ventricle. Note the two\r\nlarge branches, the _innominate arteries_, given off by it near its\r\norigin. Each innominate divides into three smaller arteries, a\r\n_carotid_, _branchial_, and _pectoral_. The aorta itself turns toward\r\nthe back and continues posteriorly through the body as the _dorsal\r\naorta_. To the right auricle come three large veins, the _right_ and\r\n_left præcavæ_ and the _postcava_. Each præcava is formed by three\r\nveins, the _jugular_ from the head, the _branchial_ from the wing, and\r\nthe _pectoral_ from the pectoral muscles. The postcava comes from the\r\nliver. From the right ventricle go the short _right_ and _left pulmonary\r\narteries_ to the lungs, and from the lungs the blood is brought to the\r\nleft auricle through the _right_ and _left pulmonary veins_.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--For a detailed study of the circulation of the\r\n    bird the teacher should inject the blood system of some larger\r\n    bird, as a pigeon or fowl, for a class-demonstration. (For a\r\n    guide, use Parker's \"Zootomy,\" p. 209, or Martin and Moale's \"How\r\n    to Dissect a Bird,\" pp. 135-140 and pp. 148, 149.)\r\n\r\nIn the posterior dorsal region of the body-cavity will be found large\r\nthree-lobed organs fitting into the spaces between the bones of the\r\nback on either side. These are the _kidneys_, and from their outer\r\nmargins on each side a _ureter_ runs posteriorly into the cloaca.\r\nOverlying the anterior ends of the kidneys are the reproductive\r\norgans. In the male these glands consist of firm, whitish, glandular\r\nbodies. From each runs a long convoluted _vas deferens_, which enters\r\nthe cloaca. This tube corresponds to the _egg-duct_ of the female. In\r\nthe female the _right egg-gland_ and _egg-duct_ or _oviduct_ are\r\nwanting. The _left egg-gland_ appears as a glandular mass; during the\r\nbreeding season yellow _ova_ or _eggs_ in various stages of\r\ndevelopment project from its surface. The oviduct opens by a\r\nfunnel-shaped mouth near the _egg-gland_ and runs thence to the\r\ncloaca. The eggs pass from the egg-gland into the body-cavity, where\r\nthey are caught in the upper end of the oviduct and carried down and\r\nout through the cloacal opening. It is in the oviduct that the egg\r\nderives its accessory covering, which consists of a white or\r\nalbuminous portion, together with several enveloping membranes and the\r\nhard shell enclosing all.\r\n\r\nRemove the top of the skull and note the large _brain_. What portions\r\nof the brain make up the greater part of it? Note the differences\r\nbetween this brain and that of the toad. Trace the principal _cranial\r\nnerves_. Work out the _spinal cord_ and principal _spinal nerves_. For\r\nan account of the nervous system of the sparrow see Martin and Moale's\r\n\"How to Dissect a Bird,\" pp. 150-163.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--For a study of the skeleton of the sparrow a\r\n    specimen should be cleaned by boiling in a soap-solution (see p.\r\n    452).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--Dissection of the English sparrow, _Passer\r\ndomesticus_.]\r\n\r\nIn the sparrow's _skeleton_ note the compactness of the _skull_ and\r\nthe fusion of its bones. Observe the long _cervical vertebræ_ which\r\nsupport the skull, also the _thoracic vertebræ_ bearing the ribs and\r\nsternum. How many of each of these kinds of vertebræ are there? The\r\nvertebræ posterior to the thorax are more or less fused together to\r\nform the _sacrum_, which, with the _pelvic girdle_, supports the\r\n_leg-bones_. The bones of the tail consist of a number of very small\r\nvertebræ, some of which are fused together. Note the correspondence\r\nbetween the bones of the leg and those of the wing. What are the names\r\nof each of the bones of each limb, and what are the corresponding\r\nbones in the two limbs? The wings and legs being modified for\r\ndifferent uses, their various bones have assumed different relations\r\nto each other and to the body, for they are bent at directly opposite\r\nangles and the attachment of muscles is different. Compare the\r\nskeleton of the bird with that of the toad. (For a detailed account of\r\nthe skeleton of the bird see Parker's \"Zootomy,\" pp. 182-209, or\r\nMartin and Moale's \"How to Dissect a Bird,\" pp. 102-125.)\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The English sparrow was first introduced\r\ninto the United States in 1850, and since that time has rapidly\r\npopulated most of the cities and towns of the country. On account of\r\nits extreme adaptability to surroundings, its omnivorous food-habits\r\nand its fecundity it survives where other birds would die out. It also\r\ncrowds out and has caused the disappearance or death of other birds\r\nmore attractive and more useful. The sparrow annually rears five or\r\nsix broods of young, laying from six to ten eggs at each sitting. Had\r\nit no enemies a single pair of sparrows would multiply to a most\r\nastonishing number. The sparrow has, however, a number of enemies,\r\nmost common among them perhaps being the \"small boy,\" but birds and\r\nmammals play the chief part in the destruction. The smaller hawks prey\r\nupon them, and rats and mice destroy great numbers of their young and\r\nof their eggs whenever the nests can be reached. The sparrow is\r\nomnivorous and when driven to it is a loathsome scavenger, though at\r\nother times its tastes are for dainty fruits. Its senses of perception\r\nare of the keenest; it can determine friend or foe at long range. The\r\nnesting habits are simple, the nests being roughly made of any sort of\r\ntwigs and stems mixed with hair and feathers and placed in cornices or\r\ntrees. A maple-tree in a small Missouri town contained at one time\r\nthirty-seven of these nests.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OTHER BIRDS.\r\n\r\nBirds are readily and unmistakably distinguishable from all other kinds\r\nof animals by their feathers. They are further distinguished from the\r\nreptiles on one hand by their possession of a complete double\r\ncirculation and by their warm blood (normally of a temperature of from\r\n100-112° F.), and from the mammals on the other by the absence of\r\nmilk-glands. There are about 10,000 known species of living birds; they\r\noccur in all countries, being most numerous and varied in the tropics.\r\nBirds are exceptionally available animals for the special attention of\r\nbeginning students, because of their abundance and conspicuousness and\r\nthe readiness with which their varied and interesting habits may be\r\nobserved. The bright colors and characteristic manners which make the\r\nidentification of the different kinds easy, the songs and flight, and\r\nthe feeding, nesting and general domestic habits of birds are all\r\nexcellent subjects for personal field-studies by the students. We shall\r\ntherefore devote more attention to the birds than to the other classes\r\nof vertebrates, just as we selected the insects among the invertebrates\r\nfor special consideration.\r\n\r\n=Body form and structure.=--The general body form and external\r\nappearance of a bird are too familiar to need description. The\r\ncovering of feathers, the modification of the fore limbs into wings,\r\nand the toothless, beaked mouth are characteristic and distinguishing\r\nexternal features. The feathers, although covering the whole of the\r\nsurface of the body, are not uniformly distributed, but are grouped in\r\ntracts called _pterylæ_, separated by bare or downy spaces called\r\n_apteria_. They are of several kinds, the short soft plumules or\r\ndown-feathers, the large stiffer contour-feathers, whose ends form the\r\noutermost covering of the body, the quill-feathers of the wings and\r\ntail, and the fine bristles or vibrissæ about the eyes and nostrils\r\ncalled thread-feathers. The fore limbs are modified to serve as wings,\r\nwhich are well developed in almost all birds. However, the strange\r\nKiwi or Apteryx of New Zealand with hair-like feathers is almost\r\nwingless, and the penguins have the wings so reduced as to be\r\nincapable of flight, but serving as flippers to aid in swimming\r\nunderneath the water. The ostriches and cassowaries also have only\r\nrudimentary wings and are not able to fly. Legs are present and\r\nfunctional in all birds, varying in relative length, shape of feet,\r\netc., to suit the special perching, running, wading, or swimming\r\nhabits of the various kinds. Living birds are toothless, although\r\ncertain extinct forms, known through fossils, had large teeth set in\r\nsockets on both jaws. The place of teeth is taken, as far as may be,\r\nby the bill or beak formed of the two jaws, projecting forward and\r\ntapering more or less abruptly to a point. In most birds the jaws or\r\nmandibles are covered by a horny sheath. In some water and shore forms\r\nthe mandibular covering is soft and leathery. The range in size of\r\nbirds is indicated by comparing a humming-bird with an ostrich.\r\n\r\nMany of the bones of birds are hollow and contain air. The air-spaces\r\nin them connect with air-sacs in the body, which connect in turn with\r\nthe lungs. Thus a bird's body contains a large amount of air, a\r\ncondition helpful of course in flight. The breast-bone is usually\r\nprovided with a marked ridge or keel for the attachment of the large\r\nand powerful muscles that move the wings, but in those birds like the\r\nostriches, which do not fly and have only rudimentary wings, this keel\r\nis greatly reduced or wholly wanting. The fore limbs or wings are\r\nterminated by three \"fingers\" only; the legs have usually four,\r\nalthough a few birds have only three toes and the ostriches but two.\r\n\r\nAs birds have no teeth with which to masticate their food, a special\r\nregion of the alimentary canal, the gizzard, is provided with strong\r\nmuscles and a hard and rough inner surface by means of which the food\r\nis crushed. Seed-eating birds have the gizzard especially well\r\ndeveloped, and some birds take small stones into the gizzard to assist\r\nin the grinding. The lungs of birds are more complex than those of\r\nbatrachians and reptiles, being divided into small spaces by numerous\r\nmembranous partitions. They are not lobed as in mammals, and do not\r\nlie free in the body-cavity, but are fixed to the inner dorsal region\r\nof the body. Connected with the lungs are the air-sacs already\r\nreferred to, which are in turn connected with the air-spaces in the\r\nhollow bones. By this arrangement the bird can fill with air not only\r\nits lungs but all the special air-sacs and spaces and thus greatly\r\nlower its specific gravity. The vocal utterances of birds are produced\r\nby the vocal cords of the syrinx or lower larynx, situated at the\r\nlower end of the trachea just where it divides into the two bronchial\r\ntubes, the tracheal rings being here modified so as to produce a\r\nvoice-box containing two vocal cords controlled by five or six pairs\r\nof muscles. The air passing through the voice-box strikes against the\r\nvocal cords, the tension of which can be varied by the muscles. In\r\nmammals the voice-organ is at the upper or throat end of the trachea.\r\n\r\nThe heart of birds is composed of four distinct chambers, the septum\r\nbetween the two ventricles, incomplete in the Reptilia, being in this\r\ngroup complete. There is thus no mixing of arterial and venous blood in\r\nthe heart. The systemic blood-circulation being completely separated\r\nfrom the pulmonic, the circulation is said to be double. The circulation\r\nof birds is active and intense; they have the hottest blood and the\r\nquickest pulse of all animals. In them the brain is compact and large,\r\nand more highly developed than in batrachians and reptiles, but the\r\ncerebrum has no convolutions as in the mammals. Of the special senses\r\nthe organs of touch and taste are apparently not keen; those of smell,\r\nhearing, and sight are well developed. The optic lobes of the brain are\r\nof great size, relatively, compared with those of other vertebrate\r\nbrains, and there is no doubt that the sight of birds is keen and\r\neffective. The power of accommodation or of quickly changing the focus\r\nof the eye is highly perfected. The structure of the ear is\r\ncomparatively simple, there being ordinarily no external ear, other than\r\na simple opening. The organs of the inner ear, however, are well\r\ndeveloped, and birds undoubtedly have excellent hearing. The nostrils\r\nopen upon the beak, and the nasal chambers are not at all complex, the\r\nsmelling surface being not very extensive. It is probable that the sense\r\nof smell is not, as a rule, especially keen.\r\n\r\n=Development and life-history.=--All birds are hatched from eggs,\r\nwhich undergo a longer or shorter period of incubation outside the\r\nbody of the mother, and which are, in most cases, laid in a nest and\r\nincubated by the parents. The eggs are fertilized within the body of\r\nthe female, the mating time of most birds being in the spring or early\r\nsummer. Some kinds, the English sparrow, for example, rear numerous\r\nbroods each year, but most species have only one or at most two. The\r\neggs vary greatly in size and color-markings, and in number from one,\r\nas with many of the Arctic ocean birds, to six or ten, as with most of\r\nthe familiar song-birds, or from ten to twenty, as with some of the\r\npheasants and grouse. The duration of incubation (outside the body)\r\nvaries from ten to thirty days among the more familiar birds, to\r\nnearly fifty among the ostriches. The temperature necessary for\r\nincubation is about 40° C. (100° F.). Among polygamous birds (species\r\nin which a male mates with several or many females) the males take no\r\npart in the incubation and little or none in the care of the hatched\r\nyoung; among most monogamous birds, however, the male helps to build\r\nthe nest, takes his turn at sitting on the eggs, and is active in\r\nbringing food for the young, and in defending them from enemies. The\r\nyoung, when ready to hatch, break the egg-shell with the \"egg-tooth,\"\r\na horny pointed projection on the upper mandible, and emerge either\r\nblind and almost naked, dependent upon the parents for food until able\r\nto fly (altricial young), or with eyes open and with body covered with\r\ndown, and able in a few hours to feed themselves (precocial young).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--The nest and eggs of the black phœbe,\r\n_Sayornis nigricans_. (Photograph by J. O. Snyder.)]\r\n\r\nMore details regarding the eggs, nest, and young of birds will be\r\ngiven later in this chapter.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The class Aves is usually divided into numerous\r\norders, the number and limits of these as published in zoological\r\nmanuals varying according to the opinions of various zoologists. The\r\nrank of an order in this group is far lower than in most other\r\nclasses. In other words, the orders are very much alike and are\r\nrecognized mainly for the convenience in breaking up the vast\r\nassemblage of species. In North America practically all the\r\nornithologists have agreed upon a scheme of classification, which will\r\ntherefore be adopted in this book. According to this classification\r\nthe eight hundred (approximately) known species of North American\r\nbirds represent seventeen orders. Certain recognized orders, for\r\nexample, the ostriches, are not represented naturally in North America\r\nat all. As birds can usually be readily identified, the species being\r\neasily distinguished by general external appearance, and as there are\r\nmany excellent book-guides to their classification, the beginning\r\nstudent can specially well begin with them his study of systematic\r\nzoology, which concerns the identification and classification of\r\nspecies. In a later paragraph are given therefore some suggestions for\r\nfield and laboratory work in the determination of local bird-faunæ. In\r\nthe following paragraphs each of the American orders is briefly\r\ndiscussed, as is also the foreign order of ostriches.\r\n\r\n=The ostriches, cassowaries, etc. (Ratitæ).=--The ostriches, familiar to\r\nall from pictures and to some from live individuals in zoological\r\ngardens and menageries, or stuffed specimens in museums, together with a\r\nfew other similar large species, are distinguished from all other birds\r\nby having the breast-bone flat instead of keeled. There are about a\r\nscore of species of ostriches and ostrich-like birds all confined to the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. In them the wings are so reduced that flight is\r\nimpossible, but the legs are long and strong, and they can run as\r\nswiftly as a galloping horse. They are said to have a stride of over\r\ntwenty feet. They use their legs also as weapons, kicking viciously when\r\nangered. The true ostriches (_Struthio camelus_) (fig. 135) live in\r\nAfrica. They are the largest living birds, reaching a height of nearly\r\nseven feet and weighing as much as two hundred pounds. They are hunted\r\nfor their feathers, and are now kept in captivity and bred in South\r\nAfrica and California for the same purpose. About five million dollars'\r\nworth of ostrich-feathers are used each year. The eggs, which are from\r\nfive to six inches long and nearly five inches thick, are laid in\r\nshallow hollows scooped out in the sand of the desert. The male\r\nundertakes most of the incubation, although when the sun is hot no\r\nbrooding is necessary. The young (fig. 136) hatch in from seven to\r\neight weeks, and can run about immediately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--Ostriches on ostrich farm at Pasadena,\r\nCalifornia. (Photograph from life.)]\r\n\r\nThe rheas, found in South America, and the cassowaries of Australia\r\nare the only other living ostrich-like birds. Their feathers are of\r\nmuch less value than those of the true ostrich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Young ostriches just from egg; on ostrich\r\nfarm at Pasadena, California. (Photograph from life.)]\r\n\r\n=The loons, grebes, auks, etc. (Pygopodes).=--The loons, grebes, and\r\nauks are aquatic birds, living in both ocean and fresh waters. Their\r\nfeet are webbed or lobed, and their legs set so far back that walking is\r\nvery difficult and awkward. But all the birds of this order are\r\nexcellent swimmers and divers. They are distinctively the diving birds.\r\nThey have short wings and almost no tail. The dab-chick or pied-billed\r\ngrebe (_Podilymbus podiceps_) is common in ponds over all the country.\r\nIts eggs are laid in a floating nest of pond vegetation and are often\r\ncovered with decaying plants. The horned grebe (_Colymbus auritus_) is\r\ncommon west of the Mississippi in lakes and ponds. The loon or great\r\nnorthern diver (_Gavia imber_), found all over the United States in\r\nwinter, is the largest of this group, reaching a length (from bill to\r\ntip of tail) of three feet. It is black above with many small white\r\nspots, and with a patch of white streaks on each side of the neck and on\r\nthe throat; it is white on breast and belly. The female is duller, being\r\nbrownish instead of black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--Murres, _Uria troile californica_, on Walrus\r\nIsland, (Pribilof Group) Behring's Sea. Note the eggs scattered about\r\nover the bare rocks. (Photograph from life by the Fur Seal\r\nCommission.)]\r\n\r\nThe auks, guillemots, puffins, and murres (fig. 137) are ocean birds\r\nwhich gather, in the breeding season, in countless numbers on the\r\nbleak rocks and inaccessible cliffs of the northern oceans. Each\r\nfemale lays a single egg (in some cases two or at most three) on the\r\nbare rock or in a crevice or sort of burrow. These birds mostly fly\r\nwell, but are especially at home in the water, feeding exclusively on\r\nanimal substances found there. A famous species is the great auk\r\n(_Alca impennis_), which has become extinct in historical times. The\r\nlast living specimen was seen in 1844.\r\n\r\n=The gulls, terns, petrels, and albatrosses (Longipennes).=--The\r\nLongipennes are water-birds, mostly maritime, with webbed feet and very\r\nlong and pointed wings. They are all strong flyers, and most of them are\r\nbeautiful birds. Their prevailing colors are white, slaty or lead-blue,\r\nblack, and, in the young, mottled brownish. They subsist chiefly on\r\nfish, but any animal substance will be eagerly picked up from the water;\r\nsome of the gulls forage inland. Occasionally great flocks may be seen\r\nfollowing a plow near the shore and feeding on the grubs and worms\r\nexposed in the freshly-turned soil. Some of the gulls, like the great\r\nblack-backed gull (_Larus marinus_), attain a length of two and one-half\r\nfeet. The terns (_Sterna_) are mostly smaller than the gulls, have a\r\nbill not so heavy and not hooked, and have the tail forked.\r\n\r\nThe fulmars, shearwaters, petrels, and albatrosses are strictly\r\nmaritime. The albatrosses are very large, the largest being three feet\r\nlong with a spread of wing of seven feet. They are often found flying\r\neasily over the open ocean at great distances from land. Like the auks\r\nand puffins, the fulmars and shearwaters gather in extraordinary\r\nnumbers on rocky ocean islets or cliffs of the coast to breed.\r\n\r\n=The cormorants, pelicans, etc. (Steganopodes).=--The Steganopodes are\r\nwater-birds with full-webbed feet, and prominent gular pouch, swimmers\r\nrather than flyers like the Longipennes. The cormorants\r\n(_Phalacrocorax_) inhabit rocky coasts and are green-eyed, large,\r\nheavy, black birds with greenish-purple and violet iridescence; they\r\nare among the most familiar of seashore birds. They feed chiefly on\r\nfish and dive and swim under water with great ability. Cormorants are\r\nrather gregarious, keeping together in small groups when fishing,\r\nmigrating often in great flocks, and in the breeding season gathering\r\nin immense numbers on certain rocky cliffs or islets. They build their\r\nnests of sticks and sea-weed; the eggs are three or four, and usually\r\nbluish green with white, chalky covering substance.\r\n\r\nThe pelicans are large, long-winged, short-legged water-birds with\r\nenormous bill and large gular sac which is used as a dip-net to catch\r\nfish. There are three species in North America, the white pelican\r\n(_Pelecanus erythrorhynchus_) occurring over most of the United\r\nStates, the brown pelican (_P. fuscus_) of the Gulf of Mexico, and the\r\nCalifornia brown pelican (_P. californicus_) of the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nAn interesting member of this order is the famous frigate or man-of-war\r\nbird (_Fregata aquila_), with very long wings and tail and feet\r\nextraordinarily small. The frigates have the greatest command of wing of\r\nall the birds. They cannot dive and can scarcely swim or walk.\r\n\r\n=The ducks, geese, and swans (Anseres).=--The familiar wild ducks, of\r\nwhich there are forty species in North American fresh and salt waters;\r\nthe geese, of which there are sixteen species, and the three species\r\nof wild swans constitute the order Anseres. The bill in these birds is\r\nmore or less flattened and is also lamellate, i.e. furnished along\r\neach cutting-edge with a regular series of tooth-like processes; the\r\nfeet are webbed, and the body is heavy and flattened beneath. Of the\r\nfresh-water or inland ducks, the more familiar are the mallard (_Anas\r\nboschas_), a large duck with head (male) and upper neck rich glossy\r\ngreen; the blue-winged teal (_Querquedula discors_) and green-winged\r\nteal (_Nettion carolinense_); the shoveller (_Spatula clypeata_) with\r\nspoon-shaped bill; the beautiful crested wood-duck (_Aix sponsa_); the\r\nexpert diver, the plump little ruddy duck (_Erismatura rubida_), and\r\nothers. Of the coastwise ducks, the canvas-back (_Aythya vallisneria_)\r\nis famous because of its fine flavor, while among the strictly\r\nmaritime ducks the eiders (_Somateria_), which live in Arctic regions,\r\nare well known for their fine down. Of the geese, the commonest is the\r\nwell-known Canada goose (_Branta canadensis_), while the pure-white\r\nsnow-goose (_Chen hyperborea_), with black wing-feathers and red bill,\r\nis not unfamiliar. The wild swans (_Olor_) are the largest birds of\r\nthe order, and are less familiar than the ducks and geese.\r\n\r\n=The ibises, herons, and bitterns (Herodiones).=--The tall, long-necked,\r\nlong-legged, wading birds, known as herons and ibises, compose a small\r\norder, the Herodiones, of which but few representatives are at all\r\nfamiliar. Perhaps the most abundant species is the green heron (_Ardea\r\nvirescens_) or \"fly-up-the-creek,\" one of the smaller members of the\r\norder. The crown, back, and wings are green, the neck purplish cinnamon,\r\nand the throat and fore neck white-striped. This bird is commonly seen\r\nperching on an overhanging limb, or flying slowly up or down some small\r\nstream. The great blue heron (_Ardea herodias_) is common over the whole\r\ncountry. It is four feet long and grayish blue, marked with black and\r\nwhite. It may be seen standing alone in wet meadows or pastures, or\r\nflying heavily, with head drawn back and long legs outstretched. It\r\nbreeds singly, but oftener in great heronries, in trees or bushes. Its\r\nlarge bulky nests contain three to six dull, greenish-blue eggs about\r\ntwo and one-half inches long. The white egrets of the Southern States\r\nare shot for their plumes and have been locally exterminated in some\r\nplaces. The night-herons (_Nycticorax_) differ from the other forms in\r\nhaving both the neck and legs short. The bittern (_Botaurus\r\nlentiginosus_), Indian hen, stake-driver, or thunder-pumper, as it is\r\nvariously called, is a familiar member of the order, found in marshes\r\nand wet pastures, and known by its extraordinary call, sounding like the\r\n\"strokes of a mallet on a stake.\" In color it is brownish, freckled and\r\nstreaked with tawny whitish and blackish. Its nest is made on the\r\nground; its eggs, from three to five in number, are brownish drab and\r\nabout two inches long.\r\n\r\n=The cranes, rails, and coots (Paludicolæ).=--The cranes, of which\r\nthree species are known in North America, are large birds with long\r\nlegs and neck, part of the head being naked or with hair-like\r\nfeathers. The rare whooping crane (_Grus americana_) is pure white\r\nwith black on the wings, and is fifty inches long from tip of bill to\r\ntip of tail. The sand-hill crane (_G. mexicana_) is slaty gray or\r\nbrownish in color, never white, and although rare in the East is quite\r\ncommon in the South and West. Cranes build nests on the ground, and\r\nlay but two eggs, about four inches long, brownish drab in color with\r\nlarge irregular spots of dull chocolate-brown.\r\n\r\nThe rails are smaller than the cranes, with short wings and very short\r\ntail. They live in marshes and swamps, and in flying let the legs hang\r\ndown. Their legs are strong, and for escape they trust more to speed in\r\nrunning than to flight. They are hunted for food. The most abundant rail\r\nis the \"Carolina crake\" or \"sora\" (_Porzana carolina_), small and\r\nolive-brown with numerous sharp white streaks and specks. Many of these\r\nbirds are shot each year during migration in the reedy swamps of the\r\nAtlantic States. The American coot or mud-hen (_Fulica americana_), dark\r\nslate-color with white bill, is one of the most familiar pond-birds over\r\nall temperate North America. Its nest consists of a mass of broken reeds\r\nresting on the water; the eggs number about a dozen, and are clay-color\r\nwith pin-head dots of dark brown.\r\n\r\n=The snipes, sandpipers, plover, etc. (Limicolæ).=--The large order\r\nLimicolæ, the shore-birds, includes the slender-legged,\r\nslender-billed, round-headed, rather small wading birds of shores and\r\nmarshes familiar to us as snipes, plovers, sandpipers, curlews,\r\nyellow-legs, sandpeeps, turnstones, etc. Most of them are game-birds,\r\nsuch forms as the woodcock and Wilson's or English snipe being much\r\nhunted. The food of these birds consists of worms and other small\r\nanimals, which are chiefly obtained by probing with the rather\r\nflexible, sensitive, and usually long bill in the mud or sand. The\r\nkilldeer (_Ægialitis vocifera_), familiar to all in its range by its\r\npeculiar call and handsome markings, the upland or field plover\r\n(_Bartramia longicauda_), with its long legs and melodious quavering\r\nwhistle, the tall, yellow-shanked \"telltale\" or yellow-legs (_Totanus\r\nmelanoleucus_) of the marshes and wet pastures, are among the most\r\nwidespread and familiar species of the order. On the seashore the\r\ndense flocks of white-winged, whisking sandpipers and the quickly\r\nrunning groups of plump ring-necked plover are familiar sights. One\r\nof the largest birds of this order is the long-billed curlew\r\n(_Numenius longirostris_) of the upland pastures. The bill of the\r\ncurlew is long and curved downwards. The nests of these shore-birds\r\nare made on the ground and are usually little more than shallow\r\ndepressions in which the few spotted eggs (four is a common number)\r\nare laid. The young are precocial.\r\n\r\n=The grouse, quail, pheasants, turkeys, etc. (Gallinæ).=--The Gallinæ\r\ninclude most of the domestic fowls, as the hen, turkey, peacock,\r\nguinea-fowls, and pheasants, and the grouse, quail, partridges, and\r\nwild turkeys. The chief game-birds of most countries belong to this\r\norder. They have the bill short, heavy, convex, and bony, adapted for\r\npicking up and crushing seeds and grains which compose their principal\r\nfood. Their legs are strong and usually not long, and are often\r\nfeathered very low down. The Gallinæ are mostly terrestrial in habit\r\nand are sometimes known as the Rasores or \"scratchers.\" Among the more\r\nfamiliar wild gallinaceous birds are the quail or \"Bob white\"\r\n(_Colinus virginianus_), abundant in eastern and central United\r\nStates, the ruffed grouse (_Bonasa umbellus_) of the Eastern woods,\r\nand the prairie-chicken (_Tympanuchus americanus_) of the Western\r\nprairies. The sage-hen (_Centrocercus urophasianus_), the largest of\r\nthe American grouse, reaching a length of two and one-half feet, is an\r\ninteresting inhabitant of the sterile sagebrush plains of the West.\r\nThe ptarmigan (_Lagopus_) or snow-grouse, represented by several\r\nspecies, are found either among the rocks and snow-banks above timber\r\nline on high mountains, or in the Arctic regions. In summer their\r\nplumage is brown and white; in winter they turn pure white to\r\nharmonize with the uniform snow-covering. On the Pacific coast are\r\nseveral species of quail, all differing much from those of the East.\r\nThese Western species have beautiful crests of a few or several long\r\nplume-feathers, the body-plumage being also unusually beautiful. The\r\neggs of all the Gallinæ are numerous and are laid in a rude nest or\r\nsimply in a depression on the ground. In many of the species polygamy\r\nis the rule. The young are precocial.\r\n\r\n=The doves and pigeons (Columbæ).=--The doves and pigeons constitute a\r\nsmall order, the Columbæ, closely related to the Gallinæ. A\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of the Columbæ lies in the bill, which\r\nis covered at the base with a soft swollen membrane or cere in which\r\nthe nostrils open. The members of this order feed on fruits, seeds,\r\nand grains. Our most familiar wild species is the mourning-dove or\r\nturtle-dove (_Zenaidura macroura_) found abundantly all over the\r\ncountry. It lays two eggs in a loose slight nest in a low tree or on\r\nthe ground. The beautiful wild or passenger pigeon (_Ectopistes\r\nmigratorius_) was once extremely abundant in this country, moving\r\nabout in tremendous flocks in the Eastern and Central States. But it\r\nhas been so relentlessly hunted that the species is apparently\r\nbecoming extinct. In the Rocky and Sierra Nevada mountains is a rather\r\nlarge dove, the band-tailed pigeon (_Columba fasciata_), which\r\nsubsists chiefly on acorns. The domestic pigeon represented by\r\nnumerous varieties, pouters, carriers, ruff-necks, fan-tails, etc., is\r\nthe artificially selected descendant of the rock-dove (_Columba\r\nlivia_). The young of all pigeons are altricial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--Screech-owl, _Megascops asio_. (Photograph\r\nby A. L. Princeton permission of Macmillan Co.)]\r\n\r\n=The eagles, owls, and vultures (Raptores).=--The \"birds of prey\"\r\ncompose one of the larger orders, the members of which are readily\r\nrecognizable. In all the bill is heavy, powerful, and strongly hooked\r\nat the tip. The feet are strong, with long, curved claws (small in the\r\nvultures) and are fitted for seizing and holding living prey, such as\r\nsmaller birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals which constitute the\r\nprincipal food of the true raptorial species. The vultures feed on\r\ncarrion. The turkey buzzard (_Cathartes aura_) is the most familiar\r\nof the three species of carrion-feeding Raptores found in the United\r\nStates. The buzzard nests on the ground or in hollow stumps or logs,\r\nand lays two white eggs (sometimes only one) blotched with brown and\r\npurplish. The largest North American vulture is the California condor\r\n(_Pseudogryphus californianus_), which attains a length of four and\r\none-half feet, with a spread of wing of nine and one-half feet. Of the\r\neagles, the most widespread and commonest is the bald eagle (_Haliætus\r\nleucocephalus_). It is three feet long and when adult has the head and\r\nneck white. The golden eagle (_Aquila chrysætos_) has the neck and\r\nhead tawny brown. Of the many species of hawks, the marsh harrier\r\n(_Circus hudsonius_), abundant all over the country and readily known\r\nby its white rump, is one of the most familiar. The name\r\n\"chicken-hawk\" is given to two or three different species of large\r\nbroad-winged hawks of the genus _Buteo_. The stout little sparrow-hawk\r\n(_Falco sparverius_), common over the whole country, is familiar and\r\nreadily recognizable by its pronounced bluish and black wings and\r\nblack-and-white banded chestnut tail. Altogether fifty species of\r\nhawks and eagles are found in this country. Of the owls, the barn-owl\r\n(_Strix pratincola_) with its long triangular face and handsome\r\nmottled and spotted tawny coat is more or less familiar; the great\r\nhorned owl (_Bubo virginianus_), the snowy owl (_Nyctea nyctea_), and\r\nthe great gray owl (_Scotiaptex cinerea_) are the common large\r\nspecies, while the red screech-owl (_Megascops asio_) (fig. 138), the\r\nmost abundant owl in the country, and the strange burrowing owl\r\n(_Speotyto cunicularia_), which lives in the holes of prairie-dogs and\r\nground-squirrels in the West, are familiar smaller ones. Thirty-two\r\nspecies of owls are recorded from North America.\r\n\r\n=The parrots (Psittaci).=--The parrots, of which only one species is\r\nnative in the United States, constitute an interesting order of birds,\r\nthe Psittaci. They are abundant in tropical America. They have a very\r\nthick strongly hooked bill, with a thick and fleshy tongue. The feet\r\nhave two toes pointing forward and two backward. The plumage is\r\nusually brightly and gaudily colored. The natural voice is harsh and\r\ndiscordant, but many of the species can imitate with surprising\r\ncleverness the speech of man. Parrots are long-lived and usually\r\ndocile, and are much kept as pets. The single native species, the\r\nCarolina paroquet (_Conurus carolinensis_), is about a foot in length,\r\nis green, with yellow head and neck and orange-red face. Its range\r\nonce extended from the Gulf of Mexico north to the Great Lakes, but it\r\nhas been nearly exterminated in all the States but Florida.\r\n\r\n=The cuckoos and kingfishers (Coccyges).=--The cuckoos and kingfishers\r\nare regarded as constituting an order, Coccyges, a small group whose\r\nmembers are without any definite bond of union. Only ten species of\r\nNorth American birds belong to this order. The yellow-billed and\r\nblack-billed cuckoos (_Coccyzus_) or \"rain-crows\" are long-tailed,\r\nslender, lustrous drab birds, which lay their eggs in the nests of\r\nothers. They are notable for their peculiar rolling call. On the plains\r\nand hills of California and the southwest lives the road-runner or\r\nchaparral cock (_Geococcyx californianus_), a strange bird belonging to\r\nthe cuckoo family. It is nearly two feet long, of which length the tail\r\nmakes half. These birds run so rapidly that a horse is little more than\r\nable to keep up with them. They feed on fruits, various reptiles,\r\ninsects, etc. The one common kingfisher of this country, the belted\r\nkingfisher (_Ceryle alcyon_), a thick-set, heavy-billed, ashy\r\nblue-and-white bird, is familiar along streams. As it flies swiftly\r\nalong it gives its rattling cry. It nests in deep holes in the\r\nstream-banks, and lays six or eight crystal-white spheroidal eggs.\r\n\r\n=The woodpeckers (Pici).=--The familiar woodpeckers and sap-suckers\r\ncompose a well-defined order, Pici, which is represented in North\r\nAmerica by twenty-five species. The bill of the woodpecker is stout\r\nand strong, usually straight, fitted for driving or boring into wood;\r\nthe tongue is long, sharp-pointed, and barbed, fitted for spearing\r\ninsects. The feet have two toes turned forward and two backward; the\r\ntail-feathers are stiff and sharp-pointed and help support the bird as\r\nit clings to the vertical side of a tree-trunk or branch (fig. 139).\r\nThe food of most woodpeckers consists chiefly of insects, usually\r\nwood-boring larvæ (grubs). These birds do much good by destroying many\r\nnoxious insect pests of trees. A few species, the true sap-suckers,\r\nprobably feed on the sap of trees. Their nests are made in holes in\r\ntrees, and the eggs are pure white and rounded. The harsh and shrill\r\ncries of the woodpeckers are familiar to all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--The yellow-hammer, _Colaptes auratus_.\r\n(Photograph by W. E. Carlin; permission of G. O. Shields.)]\r\n\r\nThe largest and one of the most interesting woodpeckers is the\r\nivory-billed (_Campephilus principalis_), twenty inches long, glossy\r\nblue-black, with a high head-crest which is scarlet in the male. This\r\nbird lives in the heavily wooded swamps of the Southern States. Among\r\nthe more abundant and widespread, and hence better known, woodpeckers\r\nare the yellow-hammers (fig. 139) or flickers (_Colaptes auratus_ in\r\nthe East, _C. cafer_ in the West), the red-headed woodpecker\r\n(_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_), with its crimson head and neck and\r\npure-white \"vest\"; and the black-and-white downy (_Dryobates\r\npubescens_) and hairy (_D. villosus_) woodpeckers or \"sap-suckers.\"\r\nThe California woodpecker (_M. formicivorus_), a near relative of the\r\nred-headed woodpecker, has the curious habit of boring small holes in\r\nthe bark of oak- or pine-trees and sticking acorns into these holes.\r\nSometimes thousands of acorns are put into the bark of one tree, to\r\nwhich the birds come occasionally to break open some acorns and feed\r\non the grubs inside.\r\n\r\n=The whippoorwills, chimney-swifts and humming-birds\r\n(Macrochires).=--All the birds of this order are remarkable for their\r\npower of flight. They have long and pointed wings; their feet are\r\nsmall and weak and used only for perching or clinging. All feed on\r\ninsects, which are caught on the wing by the short-beaked,\r\nwide-mouthed swifts and whippoorwills and extracted from flower-cups\r\nby the humming-birds with their long and slender bills. The\r\nwhippoorwill (_Antrostomus vociferus_) is common in the woods of the\r\nEast and is readily known by its call. Its two brown-blotched white\r\neggs are laid loose on the ground or on a log or stump. The night-hawk\r\n(_Chordeiles virginianus_), common over the whole country, is seen at\r\ntwilight flying vigorously about in its search for insects. Its\r\nnesting habits are like those of the whippoorwill. The sooty-brown\r\nchimney-swifts (_Chætura pelagica_), popularly confused with the\r\nswallows, are the common inhabitants of old chimneys, in which they\r\nbuild their curious saucer-shaped open-work nests. Their eggs are pure\r\nwhite and number four or five. Of the humming-birds but one species,\r\nthe ruby-throat (_Trochilus colubris_), is to be found in the Eastern\r\nStates, but in the western and especially southwestern parts of the\r\ncountry several other species occur. In all seventeen species have\r\nbeen found in the United States. The nests (fig. 140) of the hummers\r\nare very dainty little cups lined with hair or wool or plant-down. The\r\nruby-throat lays two tiny pure-white eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--Nest and eggs of ruby-throat humming-bird,\r\n_Trochilus colubris_, seen from above, in apple-tree. (Photograph by\r\nE. G. Tabor; permission of Macmillan Co.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Horned larks, _Otocoris alpestris_, and\r\nsnowflakes, _Plectrophenax nivalis_. (Photograph from life by H. W.\r\nMenke; permission of Macmillan Co.)]\r\n\r\n=The perchers (Passeres).=--Nearly one-half of the birds of North\r\nAmerica belong to the great order Passeres, and of all the known birds\r\nof the world more than half are included in it. The Passeres or perching\r\nbirds include the familiar song-birds and a great majority of the birds\r\nof the garden, the forest, the roadside, and the field. The feet of\r\nthese birds always have four toes and are fitted for perching. The\r\nsyrinx or musical apparatus is, in most, well developed. The nesting and\r\nother domestic habits are various, but the young are always hatched in a\r\nhelpless condition and have to be fed and otherwise cared for by the\r\nparents for a longer or shorter time. The North American species of this\r\norder are grouped into eighteen families, as the fly-catcher family\r\n(Tyrannidæ), the crow family (Corvidæ), the sparrows and finches\r\n(Fringillidæ), the swallows (Hirundinidæ), the warblers (Mniotiltidæ),\r\nthe wrens (Troglodytidæ), the thrushes, robins and bluebirds (Turdidæ),\r\netc. In this book nothing can be said of the various species which\r\nbelong to this order. However, as the passerine birds are those which\r\nmost immediately surround us and which, by their familiar songs and\r\nnesting habits, most interest us, the out-door study of birds by\r\nbeginning students will be devoted chiefly to the members of this order,\r\nand many species will soon be got acquainted with. The robin and\r\nbluebird will introduce us to the shyer and less familiar song-thrushes;\r\nthe study of the kingbird or bee-martin will interest us in some of the\r\nother fly-catchers; from the familiar chipping sparrow and tree-sparrow\r\nwe shall be led to look for their cousins the swamp-sparrows and\r\nsong-sparrows, and the larger grosbeaks and cross-bills, and so on\r\nthrough the order.\r\n\r\n=Determining and studying the birds of a locality.=--To identify the\r\nvarious species of birds in the locality of the school it will be\r\nnecessary to have some book giving the descriptions of all or most of\r\nthe species of the region, with tables and keys for tracing out the\r\ndifferent forms. Such manuals or keys are numerous now; the study of\r\nbirds is one of the most popular lines of nature study, and a host of\r\nbird books has been published in the last few years. The best general\r\nmanual is Coues's \"Key to the Birds of North America,\" which includes\r\nnot only keys for tracing and descriptions of all the known species of\r\nbirds on this continent, but also accounts of the distribution, of the\r\nnesting and eggs, and of the plumage of the young birds, besides a\r\nthorough introduction to the anatomy and physiology of birds, and\r\ndirections for collecting and preserving them. Jordan's \"Manual of\r\nVertebrates\" gives keys and short descriptions of the birds found east\r\nof the Missouri River; Chapman's \"Handbook of the Birds of Eastern\r\nNorth America\" is excellent. To be able to use these manuals it is\r\nnecessary to have the bird's body in hand; and that means usually\r\ndeath for the bird. Recently there have been published several\r\nbird-keys which attempt to make it possible to determine species, the\r\ncommoner ones at any rate, without such close examination. The birds\r\nin these books are usually grouped wholly artificially (without any\r\nreference to their natural relationships) according to such salient\r\ncharacteristics as color, markings, size, habit of perching, or\r\nrunning, or flying, etc. These characteristics are such as can\r\npresumably be made out in the living bird by aid of an opera-glass or\r\noften with the unaided eye. Such books make no pretence to be\r\nscientific manuals nor to include any but the more usual and strongly\r\nmarked species. They are usually limited to the birds of a restricted\r\nregion. Such books are readily obtainable. There are several popular\r\nillustrated \"bird-magazines\" devoted to accounts of the life and\r\nhabits of birds. Of these \"Bird-lore\" is the organ of the Audubon\r\nSociety for the Protection of Birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--Western chipping sparrow, _Spizella socialis\r\narizonae_. (Photograph from life by Eliz. and Jos. Grinnell.)]\r\n\r\nIn trying to become acquainted with the birds of a locality it must be\r\nborne in mind that the bird-fauna of any region varies with the\r\nseason. Some birds live in a certain region all the year through;\r\nthese are called _residents_. Some spend only the summer or breeding\r\nseason in the locality, coming up from the South in spring and flying\r\nback in autumn; these are _summer residents_. Some spend only the\r\nwinter in the locality, coming down from the severer North at the\r\nbeginning of winter and going back with the coming of spring; these\r\nare _winter residents_. Some are to be found in the locality only in\r\nspring and autumn as they are migrating north and south between their\r\ntropical winter quarters and their northern summer or breeding home;\r\nthese are _migrants_. And finally an occasional representative of\r\ncertain bird species whose normal habitat does not include the given\r\nlocality at all will appear now and then blown aside from its regular\r\npath of migration or otherwise astray; these are _visitants_. As to\r\nthe relative importance, numerically, of these various categories\r\namong the birds which may be found in a certain region and thus form\r\nits bird-fauna we may illustrate by reference to a definite region. Of\r\nthe 351 species of birds which have been found in the State of Kansas\r\n(a region without distinct natural boundaries and fairly\r\nrepresentative of any Mississippi valley region of similar extent), 51\r\nare all-year residents; 125 are summer residents, 36 are winter\r\nresidents, 104 are migrants, and 35 are rare visitants.\r\n\r\nIt must also be kept in mind in using bird-keys and descriptions to\r\ndetermine species that the descriptions and keys refer to adult birds\r\nand in ordinary plumage. Among numerous birds the young of the year,\r\nold enough to fly and as large as the adults, still differ\r\nconsiderably in plumage from the latter; males differ from females,\r\nand finally both males and females may change their plumage (hence\r\ncolor and markings) with the season. The seasonal changes of plumage\r\naccomplished by molting may be marked or hardly noticeable. \"All birds\r\nget new suits at least once a year, changing in the fall. Some change\r\nin the spring also, either partially or wholly, while others have as\r\nmany as three changes--perhaps, to a slight extent, a few more.... It\r\nis claimed by some that now all new colors are acquired by molt, and\r\nby others that in some instances (young hawks) an infusion or loss,\r\nas the case may be, of pigment takes place as the feather forms, and\r\ncontinues so long as it grows.\"\r\n\r\nThere is much lack and uncertainty of knowledge concerning the molting\r\nand change of plumage by birds, and careful observations by\r\nbird-students should be made on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn connection with learning the different kinds of birds in a\r\nlocality, together with their names, observations should be made, and\r\nnotes of them recorded, on their habits and on the relation or\r\nadaptation of structure and habit to the life of the bird. Some of the\r\nspecial subjects for such observation are pointed out in the following\r\nparagraphs. A suggestive book, treating of the adaptive structure and\r\nthe life of birds is Baskett's \"The Story of the Birds.\"\r\n\r\n=Bills and feet.=--The interesting adaptation of structure to special\r\nuse is admirably shown in the varying character of the bills and feet of\r\nbirds. The various feeding habits and uses of the feet of different\r\nbirds are readily observed, and the accompanying modification of bills\r\nand feet can be readily seen in birds either freshly killed or preserved\r\nas \"bird-skins.\" Such skins may be made as directed on p. 467, or may be\r\nbought cheaply of taxidermists. A set of such skins, properly named,\r\nwill be of great help in studying birds, and should be in the\r\nhigh-school collection. In some cases the general structure of feet and\r\nbills may be seen in the live birds by the use of an opera-glass. The\r\ncharacters of bills and feet are much used in the classification of\r\nbirds, so that any knowledge of them gained primarily in the study of\r\nadaptations will have a secondary use in classification work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--Russet-backed thrush, _Turdus ustulatus_.\r\n(Photograph from life by Eliz. and Jos. Grinnell.)]\r\n\r\nNote the foot of the robin, bluebird, catbird, wrens, warblers and\r\nother passerine or perching birds. It has three unwebbed toes in\r\nfront, and a long hind toe perfectly opposable to the middle front\r\none. This is the _perching_ foot. Note the so-called _zygodactyl_ foot\r\nof the woodpecker, with two toes projecting in front and partly yoked\r\ntogether, and two similarly yoked projecting behind. Note the webbed\r\nswimming foot of the aquatic birds; note the different degrees of\r\nwebbing, from the _totipalmate_, where all four toes are completely\r\nwebbed, _palmate_, where the three front toes only are bound together\r\nbut the web runs out to the claws, to the _semi-palmate_, where the\r\nweb runs out only about half way. Note the _lobate_ foot of the coots\r\nand phalaropes. Note the long slender wading legs of the sandpipers,\r\nsnipe and other shore birds; the short heavy strong leg of the divers;\r\nthe small weak leg of the swifts and humming-birds, almost always on\r\nthe wing; the stout heavily nailed foot of the scratchers, as the\r\nhens, grouse, and turkeys; and the strong grasping talons, with their\r\nsharp long curving nails, of the hawks and owls and other birds of\r\nprey. In all these cases the fitness of the structure of the foot to\r\nthe special habits of the bird is apparent.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the shape and structural character of the bill should be\r\nnoted, as related to its use, this being chiefly concerned of course\r\nwith the feeding habits. Note the strong hooked and dentate bill of\r\nthe birds of prey; they tear their prey. Note the long slender\r\nsensitive bill of the sandpipers; they probe the wet sand for worms.\r\nNote the short weak bill and wide mouth of the night-hawk and\r\nwhippoorwill and of the swifts and swallows; they catch insects in\r\nthis wide mouth while on the wing. Note the flat lamellate bill of the\r\nducks; they scoop up mud and water and strain their food from it. Note\r\nthe firm chisel-like bill of the woodpeckers; they bore into hard wood\r\nfor insects. Note the peculiarly crossed mandibles of the cross-bills;\r\nthey tear open pine-cones for seeds. Note the long sharp slender bill\r\nof the humming-birds; they get insects from the bottom of flower-cups.\r\nNote the bill and foot of any bird you examine, and see if they are\r\nspecially adapted to the habits of the bird.\r\n\r\nThe tongues and tails of birds are two other structures the\r\nmodifications and special uses of which may be readily observed and\r\nstudied. Note the structure and special use of the tongue and tail of\r\nthe woodpeckers; note the tongue of the humming-bird; the tail of the\r\ngrackles.\r\n\r\n=Flight and songs.=--The most casual observation of birds reveals\r\ndifferences in the flight of different kinds, so characteristic and\r\ndistinctive as to give much aid in determining the identity of birds in\r\nnature. Note the flight of the woodpeckers; it identifies them\r\nunmistakably in the air. Note the rapid beating of the wings of quail\r\nand grouse; also of wild ducks; the slow heavy flapping of the larger\r\nhawks and owls and of the crows; and the splendid soaring of the\r\nturkey-buzzard and of the gulls. This soaring has been the subject of\r\nmuch observation and study but is still imperfectly understood. The\r\nsoaring bird evidently takes advantage of horizontal air-currents, and\r\nsome observers maintain that upward currents also must be present. The\r\nprincipal hopes for the invention of a successful flying-machine rest on\r\nthe power of soaring possessed by birds. The speed of flight of some\r\nbirds is enormous, the passenger-pigeon having been estimated to attain\r\na speed of one hundred miles an hour. The long distances covered in a\r\nsingle continuous flight by certain birds are also extraordinary, as is\r\nalso the total distance covered by some of the migrants. \"It is said\r\nthat some plovers that nest in Labrador winter in Patagonia, their long\r\nwings easily carrying them this great distance.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--Oriole's nest with skeleton of blue jay\r\nsuspended from it; the blue jay probably came to the nest to eat the\r\neggs, became entangled in the strings composing the nest, and died by\r\nhanging. (Photograph by S. J. Hunter.)]\r\n\r\nVarying even more than the manner and power of flight among different\r\nbirds are the vocal utterances, the cries and calls and singing. By\r\ntheir calls and songs alone many birds may be identified although they\r\nremain unseen. The field-student of birds comes to know them by their\r\nsongs; knows what birds they are; knows what they are doing or not\r\ndoing; knows what time in their life-season it is, whether they are\r\nmating, or brooding, or preparing to migrate; knows whether they are\r\nfrightened, or self-confident, whether in distress or happy. Little\r\nurging and suggestion are needed to induce the student to attend to\r\nthe songs. But the naturalist should not only hear and enjoy them, but\r\nby observation and the recording of repeated observations, he should\r\ncome to understand the significance of the calls and songs.\r\n\r\nAs to how these sounds are made, attention has already been called (see\r\np. 338) to the voice-organ or syrinx. The condition of this organ varies\r\nmuch in birds, as would be expected from the differing character of\r\nvocal utterances. Dissections will make these differences apparent.\r\n\r\n=Nesting and care of young.=--Among the birds' most interesting\r\ninstincts and habits are those domestic ones which include mating,\r\nnest-building, and care of the young. Birds' eggs and birds' nests are\r\nalways attractive objects of search and collection for boys, and most\r\nboys have a considerable personal knowledge of the domestic habits of\r\nthe commoner summer birds of their region. With this interest and\r\nunsystematized knowledge as a basis the teacher should be able to get\r\nfrom the class much excellent field-work and personal observation. The\r\nfirst thing to undertake in this study is the gathering of data\r\nregarding the character of the nests of different species, their\r\nsituation, the time of nesting, the participation or non-participation\r\nof the male in nest-building, etc.; also the number of eggs, their\r\nsize and color markings, the length of incubation, the help or lack of\r\nhelp of the male in brooding, etc. In connection with this gathering\r\nof data in the field by note-taking, sketching, and photographing,\r\nnests and eggs can be collected (see directions on page 469). Let only\r\none clutch of eggs of each species be taken for the common high-school\r\ncollection, and if more than one nest is desired take used and\r\ndeserted nests. When the nestlings are hatched, the bringing of food,\r\nthe defence of the home, and the teaching of the young to fly should\r\nall be observed and noted.\r\n\r\nSome attempt should be made to systematize the miscellaneous data\r\nobtained. Do all the members of a group have similar nesting habits?\r\nNote the early nesting of birds of prey; note the nests of the\r\nwoodpeckers in holes in trees; note the nesting of the various\r\nswallows. Is there any significance in the colors and markings of\r\neggs? Observe the protective coloration obvious in some (see Chap.\r\nXXXI). Are there differences in the condition of the newly hatched\r\nnestlings? Note the helpless altricial young of the robin; the\r\nindependent precocial young of the quail.\r\n\r\nThe strong influence of the mating passion will be made plain by\r\nobservations on the fighting, love-making, singing, and general\r\nbehavior of the birds in the mating season. The expression of the\r\nmental and emotional traits, the psychic phenomena of birds, are most\r\nemphasized at this time, and reveal the possession among animals lower\r\nthan man of many characteristics which are too commonly ascribed as\r\nthe exclusive attributes of the human species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--Western robin, _Merula migratoria\r\npropinqua_. (Photograph from life by Eliz. and Jos. Grinnell.)]\r\n\r\n=Local distribution and migration.=--As explained in Chapter XXXII,\r\nthe geographical distribution of animals is a subject of much\r\nimportance, and offers good opportunities in its more local features\r\nfor student field-work. The field-study of the birds of a given\r\nlocality will comprise much observation bearing directly on\r\nzoogeography or the distribution of animals. Certain birds will be\r\nfound to be limited to certain parts of even a small region, the\r\nswimmers will be found in ponds and streams and the long-legged\r\nshore-birds on the pond- or stream-banks, or in the marshes and wet\r\nmeadows, although a few like the upland plover, curlews, and godwits\r\nare common on the dry upland pastures. Distinguish the ground-birds\r\nfrom the birds of the shrubs and hedge-rows and these again from the\r\nstrictly forest-birds. Find the special haunts of swallows and\r\nkingfishers. Which are the shy birds driven constantly deeper into the\r\nwild places or being exterminated by the advance of man; which birds\r\ndo not retreat but even find an advantage in man's seizure of the\r\nland, obtaining food from his fields and gardens?\r\n\r\nMake a map on large scale of the locality of the school, showing on it\r\nthe topographic features of the region, such as streams, ponds,\r\nmarshes, hills, woods, springs, wild pastures, etc., also roads and\r\npaths, and such landmarks as schoolhouses, county churches, etc. On\r\nthis map indicate the local distribution of the birds, as determined\r\nby the data gradually gathered; mark favorite nesting-places of\r\nvarious species, roosting-places of crows and blackbirds,\r\nfeeding-places, and bathing- and drinking-places of certain kinds, the\r\nexact spots of finding rare visitants, rare nests, etc., etc. The\r\nmaking of such a zoogeographical map will be a source of great\r\ninterest and profit to the students.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, many of the birds of a locality are \"migrants,\"\r\nthat is, they breed farther north, but spend the winter in more\r\nsouthern latitudes. These migrants pass through the locality twice\r\neach year, going north in the spring and south in the autumn. They are\r\nmuch more likely to be observed during the spring migration than in\r\nthe fall, as the flight south is usually more hurried. The observation\r\nof the migration of birds is very interesting, and much can be done by\r\nbeginning students. Notes should be made recording the first time each\r\nspring a migrating species is seen, the time when it is most abundant\r\nand the last time it is seen the same spring. Similar records should\r\nbe made showing the movements of the birds in the fall. A series of\r\nsuch records covering a few years will show which are the earliest\r\nspecies to appear, which the later, and which the last. Such records\r\nof appearance and disappearance should also be kept for the summer\r\nresidents, those birds that come from the South in the spring, breed\r\nin the locality, and then depart for the South again in the autumn.\r\nNotes on the kinds of days, as stormy, clear, cold, warm, etc., on\r\nwhich the migration seems to be most active; on the greater prevalence\r\nof migratory flights by day or by night; on the height from the earth\r\nat which the migrants fly, etc., are all worth while. The Division of\r\nBiological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture, keeps records of\r\nnotes on migration sent in by voluntary observers and furnishes blanks\r\nto be filled out by each observer. A suggestive book about migration,\r\nand one giving the records for many species at many points in the\r\nMississippi valley is Cooke's \"Bird Migration in the Mississippi\r\nValley.\" Migration is discussed in most bird-books.\r\n\r\n=Feeding habits, economics, and protection of birds.=--The feeding\r\nhabits of birds are not only interesting, but their determination\r\ndecides the economic relation of birds to man, that is, whether a\r\nparticular bird species is harmful or beneficial to man. Casual\r\nobservation shows that birds eat worms, grains, seeds, fruits,\r\ninsects. A single species often is both fruit-eating and\r\ninsect-eating. Do fruits or do insects compose the chief food-supply\r\nof the species? To determine this more than casual observation is\r\nnecessary. The birds must be watched when feeding at different\r\nseasons. The most effective way of determining the kind of food which\r\nthe bird takes is to examine the stomachs of many individuals taken at\r\nvarious times and localities. Much work of this kind has been done,\r\nespecially by the investigators connected with the Division of\r\nBiological Survey of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and\r\npamphlets giving the results of these investigations can be had from\r\nthe Division. It has been distinctly shown that a great majority of\r\nbirds are chiefly beneficial to man by eating noxious insects and the\r\nseeds of weeds. Many birds commonly reputed to be harmful, and for\r\nthat reason shot by farmers and fruit-growers, have been proved to do\r\nmuch more good than harm. Some few birds have been proved to be, on\r\nthe whole, harmful. An investigation of the food habits of the crow, a\r\nbird of ill-repute among farmers, based on an examination of 909\r\nstomachs shows that about 29 per cent of the food for the year\r\nconsists of grain, of which corn constitutes something more than 21\r\nper cent, the greatest quantity being eaten in the three winter\r\nmonths. All of this must be either waste grain picked up in fields and\r\nroads, or corn stolen from cribs and shocks. May, the month of\r\nsprouting corn, shows a slight increase over the other spring and\r\nsummer months. On the other hand the loss of grain is offset by the\r\ndestruction of insects. These constitute more than 23 per cent of the\r\ncrow's yearly diet, and the larger part of them are noxious. The\r\nremainder of the crow's food consists of wild fruit, seeds and various\r\nanimal substances which may on the whole be considered neutral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--Sickle-billed thrasher, _Harporhynchus\r\nredevivus_. (Photograph from life by Eliz. and Jos. Grinnell.)]\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of birds for millinery purposes has become so fearful\r\nand apparent in recent years that a strong movement for their\r\nprotection has been inaugurated. Rapacious egg-collecting, legislation\r\nagainst birds wrongly thought to be harmful to grains and fruit, and\r\nthe selfish wholesale killing of birds by professional and amateur\r\nhunters, help in the work of destruction. Apart from the brutality of\r\nsuch slaughter, and the extermination of the most beautiful and\r\nenjoyable of our animal companions, this destruction[18] works\r\nstrongly against our material interests. Birds are the natural enemies\r\nof insect pests, and the destroying of the birds means the rapid\r\nincrease and spread, and the enhanced destructive power of the pests.\r\nIt is asserted by investigators that during the past fifteen years the\r\nnumber of our common song-birds has been reduced to one-fourth. At the\r\npresent rate, says one author, extermination of many species will\r\noccur during the lives of most of us. Already the passenger-pigeon and\r\nCarolina paroquet, only a few years ago abundant, are practically\r\nexterminated. Protect the birds!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[18] One of the most unfortunate and conspicuous examples of this\r\nslaughter is the partial extermination of the song-birds of Japan in\r\nthe interests of European milliners. To meet their demands the country\r\npeople used birdlime throughout the woods with disastrous\r\neffectiveness, as shown in the present exceeding scarcity of birds and\r\nthe abundance of insect pests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n             BRANCH CHORDATA (_Continued_). CLASS MAMMALIA:\r\n                              THE MAMMALS\r\n\r\n                       THE MOUSE (_Mus musculus_)\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--It is best to catch specimens alive in a good trap.\r\n    A live trap well baited and placed in some old granary should\r\n    furnish plenty for class use. White mice can often be obtained at\r\n    \"bird-stores.\" When mice are not procurable, use rats. A rat is\r\n    perhaps preferable on account of its size, but all essential\r\n    structures can readily be made out in the mouse. Specimens should be\r\n    killed by chloroform as described for the toad, p. 5.\r\n\r\n=Structure= (fig. 147).--Compare the external characters of the mouse\r\nwith those of the toad and sparrow. The mouse, unlike the other\r\nvertebrates so far studied, is thickly covered with _hair_ all over its\r\nbody except on the tip of the nose and the soles of the feet. Where are\r\nthe _nostrils_ placed? What are the large leaf-like expansions called\r\n_pinnæ_ situated just back of the eyes? Pull open the _mouth_ and note\r\nthe large _incisor teeth_ on the upper and lower jaws. Cut one corner of\r\nthe mouth back and observe the large flat-topped _molar teeth_ on both\r\njaws. How does the attachment of the large fleshy _tongue_ differ from\r\nthe condition in the toad? The toad's tongue is for snapping up insects,\r\nwhereas in the mouse this organ serves to move food about in the mouth.\r\nOn the tongue are numerous small _taste-papillæ_. Notice the long hairs,\r\n\"feelers,\" on each side of the nose. Note the similarity between the\r\nfront paws and our own hands; each has four fingers with a small\r\nrudimentary thumb on the inner side of the paw. How does the hind foot\r\nof the mouse differ from the foot of man? Posteriorly the body is\r\nterminated by a long _tail_. At the root of the tail is a small\r\naperture, the _anus_, and just below, or ventral to it, is the opening\r\nfrom the kidneys and reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Place the mouse on its back in a dissecting-pan and\r\n    cut through the skin from anus to the lower jaw. Extend the legs,\r\n    pin down each foot and pin out the cut edges of the skin. Now\r\n    carefully cut forward through the body-wall from the anal region and\r\n    on through the breast-bones and ribs. Pin each side out.\r\n\r\nNear the hindmost pair of _ribs_ note a sheet of muscles, the\r\n_diaphragm_, which extends across the body-cavity, dividing it into an\r\nanterior portion, the _thoracic cavity_, and a posterior, the _abdominal\r\ncavity_. What are the most conspicuous organs in the thoracic cavity?\r\nLeading anteriorly to the mouth-cavity is a long tube, the _trachea_,\r\ncomposed of a series of cartilaginous parts of rings placed end to end.\r\nNote at its anterior end the _glottis_ and _epiglottis_. Insert a\r\nblowpipe into the glottis and inflate the _lungs_, which will fill all\r\nthe otherwise unfilled space in the thoracic cavity. The abdominal\r\ncavity contains the _viscera_ suspended in a fold of the lining\r\nmembrane, as in the other vertebrates studied. Note lying against the\r\ndiaphragm a large, red, glandular structure, the _liver_. Separate the\r\ntwo large lobes of the liver and expose the opalescent _gall-bladder_.\r\nBy passing a canula into this and ligaturing, the _cystic duct_ may be\r\ninjected. Beneath the liver is a large loop-shaped expansion of the\r\nalimentary canal, the _stomach_. Arising from the right end of the\r\nstomach is the narrow _duodenum_, which gradually merges into the very\r\nmuch convoluted _small intestine_, or _ileum_, which is followed by the\r\n_large intestine_, or _colon_, the last part of which is a straight\r\ntube, the _rectum_. The small intestine occupies most of the space in\r\nthe peritoneal cavity. Within the loop of the pylorus will be found an\r\nirregular pinkish mass of tissue, the _pancreas_. Beneath the stomach on\r\nthe left side of the body lies a very dark glandular mass not much\r\nunlike the liver but altogether detached from it. This structure is the\r\n_spleen_, a ductless gland.\r\n\r\nNote dorsally of the trachea a long tube passing through the diaphragm\r\nand connecting the mouth with the stomach. What is this tube? Note the\r\n_Eustachian tubes_ extending from the mouth to the ears. The median\r\npart of the roof of the mouth is the _palate_, hard in front, soft\r\nbehind. A pair of small bodies at the sides of the soft palate near\r\nits hinder end are the _tonsils_. At the posterior angle of the lower\r\njaw are glandular bodies, the _sub-maxillary glands_, which lead by a\r\nshort _duct_ anteriorly to open on the floor of the mouth. On the\r\nsides of the neck just below the ears are pink or yellowish bodies,\r\nthe _parotid glands_, opening anteriorly in the sides of the\r\nmouth-cavity. These two sets of glands are collectively known as the\r\n_salivary glands_, the function of which is to secrete the saliva.\r\nPush apart the sub-maxillary glands and note below them overlying the\r\ntrachea on either side two dark-red lobes connected by a band of\r\ntissue. These constitute the _thyroid gland_, another of the so-called\r\nductless glands. Within the thoracic cavity anterior to the heart note\r\na mass of pinkish tissue, the _thymus gland_. Observe the large\r\n_masseter muscles_, which cover the jaws. What is their function? On\r\neither side of the neck lies a large blood-vessel, the _external\r\njugular vein_, which collects blood from the head and carries it down\r\nto the heart. Note the large _pectoral muscles_ which cover the breast\r\nand extend out into the arms, and which are so strong and highly\r\ndeveloped in the sparrow. The head is supported by large muscles which\r\nrun down the back of the neck to the ribs. Others are attached to the\r\nribs, which they raise and lower. These movements, together with the\r\ncontraction of the diaphragm, cause the expansion and contraction of\r\nthe thoracic cavity whereby the lungs are regularly filled and\r\nemptied. Note that the abdomen is covered by a double layer of\r\nmuscular tissue, the outer part made up of the _external oblique\r\nmuscles_, the inner by the _internal oblique muscles_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.--Diagram of the circulation of the blood in a\r\nmammal; _a_, auricles; _l_, lung; _lv_, liver; _p_, portal vein\r\nbringing blood from the intestine; _v_, ventricles; the arrows show\r\nthe direction of the current; the shaded vessels carry venous blood,\r\nthe others arterial blood. (From Kingsley.)]\r\n\r\nExamine the _heart_. How many _auricles_ has it? The _ventricles_ in the\r\nmouse, as in the bird, are entirely separated, forming two complete\r\ncompartments, a _right_ and a _left ventricle_. The blood flowing from\r\nthe veins of the body is collected in the right auricle, thence it\r\npasses into the right ventricle, whence it is conveyed to the lungs;\r\nreturning it flows through the left auricle into the left ventricle,\r\nwhence it is forced through the arteries of the body. For a study of the\r\ncirculatory system in mammals (fig. 148), a rat or a rabbit should be\r\ninjected by the teacher and an advanced text-book, as Parker's \"Zootomy\"\r\nor Marshall and Hurst's \"Practical Zoology,\" used as a guide. A sheep's\r\nheart is very good to cut open for a class demonstration.\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the organs observed thus far in the dissection.\r\n\r\nThe _kidneys_ in the mouse are situated in the dorsal region next to\r\nthe backbone. They consist of two bean-shaped smooth glands. From them\r\na pair of ducts, the _ureters_, can be traced down to a median\r\nthin-walled muscular sac, the _bladder_. The bladder opens to the\r\nexterior of the body by means of a short tube, the _urethra_. Cut open\r\na kidney longitudinally and examine the cut surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe two egg-glands of the female mouse lie in the median portion of\r\nthe abdominal cavity, somewhat below the kidneys, and from the\r\nvicinity of each runs an egg-tube. These tubes meet below the bladder,\r\nand open to the exterior of the body through the aperture noted below\r\nthe anus. In the posterior parts of these tubes lie until birth the\r\ndeveloping embryos.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--For a study of the nervous system place the\r\n    specimen ventral side down and cut through the skull with the\r\n    bone-cutters or heavy scissors, exposing the brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\nNote the large _brain_ (fig. 149), composed of small _optic lobes_,\r\nlarge _cerebrum_, _cerebellum_, and _medulla oblongata_, followed by\r\nthe long _spinal cord_. Note the nerves arising from the brain and\r\nspinal cord.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--Diagram of brains of vertebrates; _Olf. L._,\r\nolfactory lobes; _Cbr._, cerebrum; _Md. Br._, midbrain (optic lobes);\r\n_Cbl._, cerebellum; _Med. Ob._, medulla oblongata; _Sp. Cd._, spinal\r\ncord. (From specimens.)]\r\n\r\nFor a careful dissection of the mammalian nervous system a larger\r\nmammal, such as a cat or dog or rabbit, should be used. For guide use\r\na text-book such as, for the dog, Howell's \"Dissection of the Dog\";\r\nfor the cat, Reighard and Jennings' \"Anatomy of the Cat\"; and for the\r\nrabbit, Parker's \"Zootomy\" or Marshall and Hurst's \"Practical\r\nZoology.\" Make a good preparation of the brain and preserve it for\r\nfuture use in some fluid like Fischer's fluid (see page 453).\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Prepare a well-cleaned skeleton by boiling a\r\n    specimen in a soap solution and thoroughly cleansing it (see p.\r\n    452).\r\n\r\nNote the very compact _skeleton_ of the mouse. Note the closely sutured\r\n_skull_. How many _cervical_ or _neck vertebræ_ are there? The _ribs_\r\nare attached to the _thoracic vertebræ_. How many pairs of ribs? The\r\nbony thorax supports the _shoulder-girdle_ and bones of the fore legs.\r\nThe thorax is followed by a series of ribless vertebræ, the _lumbar\r\nvertebræ_, which in the posterior region of the body fuse with the\r\n_pelvic girdle_ supporting the hind limbs. The body vertebræ are\r\nsucceeded by the very much smaller _caudal vertebræ_. Compare the\r\nskeleton of the mouse with that of the bird; also with that of the toad.\r\nFor directions for a detailed study of the skeleton see in Parker's\r\n\"Zootomy\" an account of the skeleton of the rabbit, pp. 263-286.\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--For the study of the eye (fig. 150) the teacher\r\n    should obtain the eye of some large mammal, as the ox or sheep,\r\n    with which to make a class demonstration. The eye of a rabbit or\r\n    cat can of course be used. For an account of the vertebrate eye\r\n    see Parker and Haswell's \"Text-book of Zoology,\" Vol. II. pp.\r\n    103-107. For a study of the ear use a bird or mammal, and see pp.\r\n    107-110 of the same book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.--Diagram of vertebrate eye; _c_, choroid;\r\n_i_, iris; _l_, lens; _n_, optic nerve; _r_, retina; _s_, sclerotic.\r\n(From Kingsley.)]\r\n\r\n=Life-history and habits.=--The house-mouse is not a native of North\r\nAmerica, but was introduced into this country from Europe, to which,\r\nin turn, it came from Asia, its original habitat. The mouse came to\r\nthis country in the vessels of early explorers. Similarly the brown\r\nand black rats, now so abundant all over North America, and members of\r\nthe same genus as the mouse, were introduced from Europe. Accompanying\r\nman in his travels the mouse has spread from Asia until it is now to\r\nbe found over the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe habits of mice are well known; their fondness for living in our\r\nhomes and outbuildings makes them familiar acquaintances. Their food\r\nis varied; they seem to thrive best, however, on a vegetable diet.\r\nGrains and nuts are favorite foods. The house-cat is their greatest\r\nenemy, but man takes advantage of their instinct to go into holes by\r\nconstructing traps with funnel or tunnel entrances which, baited with\r\ncheese or other favorite food, are fatally attractive. In climbing,\r\nmice are aided by the tail. Their strong hind legs enable them to\r\nstand erect, and even to take several steps in this posture. They can\r\nswim readily, although naturally they rarely take to water. Their\r\nspecial senses are keen, the senses of hearing and taste being\r\nunusually well developed. Their \"singing,\" which has been the subject\r\nof much discussion, seems to be actually a voluntary and normal\r\nperformance which, however, hardly deserves to be called singing, but\r\nrather a slightly varied peeping or whistling.\r\n\r\nThe mouse is a prolific mammal, producing from four to six times a\r\nyear broods of from four to eight young. The mouse makes a cosy nest\r\nof straw, bits of paper, feathers, wool or other soft materials, and\r\nin this the young are born. The newly born mice are very small and are\r\nblind and helpless. They are odd little creatures, being naked and\r\nalmost transparent. They grow rapidly, being covered with hair in a\r\nweek, although not opening their eyes for about two weeks. A day or\r\ntwo after their eyes are open they begin to leave the nest, and hunt\r\nfor food for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER MAMMALS\r\n\r\nThe mammals constitute the highest group of animals, including man,\r\nthe monkeys and apes, the quadrupeds, the bird-like bats and fish-like\r\nseals and whales; in all about 2500 species. They are found everywhere\r\nexcept on a few small South Sea islands. Only a few species, however,\r\nhave a world-wide distribution. The name Mammalia is derived from the\r\nmammary or milk glands with which the females are provided and by the\r\nsecretion of which the young of this class, born free in all but a few\r\nof the lowest forms, are nourished for some time after birth. In size\r\nmammals range from the tiny pigmy-shrew and harvest mouse, which can\r\nclimb a stem of wheat, to the great sulphur-bottom whale of the\r\nPacific Ocean, which attains a length of a hundred feet and a weight\r\nof many tons. Mammals differ from fishes and batrachians and agree\r\nwith reptiles and birds in never having external gills; they differ\r\nfrom reptiles and agree with birds in being warm-blooded and in having\r\na heart with two distinct ventricles and a complete double\r\ncirculation; finally, they differ from both reptiles and birds in\r\nhaving the skin more or less clothed with hair, the lungs freely\r\nsuspended in a thoracic cavity separated from the abdominal by a\r\nmuscular partition, the diaphragm, and in the possession by the\r\nfemales of mammary glands. In economic uses to man mammals are the\r\nmost important of all animals. They furnish the greater portion of the\r\nanimal food of many human races, likewise a large amount of their\r\nclothing. Horses, asses, oxen, camels, reindeer, elephants, and llamas\r\nare beasts of burden and draught; swine, sheep, cattle, and goats\r\nfurnish flesh, and the two latter milk for food; the wool of sheep,\r\nthe furs of the carnivores, and the leather of cattle, horses, and\r\nothers are used for clothing, while the bones and horns of various\r\nmammals serve various purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--Dissection of the Mouse, _Mus musculus_.]\r\n\r\n=Body form and structure.=--The mammalian body varies greatly. Its\r\nvariety of form and general organization is explained by the facts\r\nthat, although most of the species live on the surface of the earth,\r\nsome are burrowers in the ground, some flyers in the air, and some\r\nswimmers in the water. Mammals never have more than two pairs of\r\nlimbs; in most cases both pairs are well developed and adapted for\r\nterrestrial progression. In the aerial bats the fore limbs are\r\nmodified into organs of flight; among the aquatic seals, sea-lions,\r\nwalruses, and whales both sets are modified to be swimming flippers or\r\npaddles. In many of these aquatic forms the hind limbs are greatly\r\nreduced or even completely wanting.\r\n\r\nMost mammals are externally clothed with hair, which is a peculiarly\r\nmodified epidermal process. Each hair, usually cylindrical, is\r\ncomposed of two parts, a central pith containing air, and an outer\r\nmore solid cortex; each hair rises from a short papilla sunk at the\r\nbottom of a follicle lying in the true skin. In some mammals the hairs\r\nassume the form of spines or \"quills,\" as in the porcupine. The hairy\r\ncoat is virtually wanting in whales and is very sparse in certain\r\nother forms, the elephant, for example, which has its skin greatly\r\nthickened. The claws of beasts of prey, the hooves of the hoofed\r\nmammals, and the outer horny sheaths of the hollow-horned ruminants\r\nare all epidermal structures.\r\n\r\nThe bones of mammals are firmer than those of other vertebrates,\r\ncontaining a larger proportion of salts of lime. Among the different\r\nforms the spinal column varies largely in the number of vertebræ, this\r\nvariation being chiefly due to differences in length of tail. Apart\r\nfrom the caudal vertebræ their usual number is about thirty. The\r\nmammalian skull is very firm and rigid, all the bones composing it,\r\nexcepting the lower jaw, the tiny auditory ossicles, and the slender\r\nbones of the hyoid arch, being immovably articulated together. The\r\ncorrespondence between the bones of the two sets of limbs is very\r\napparent. The number of digits varies in different mammals, and also\r\nin the fore and hind limbs of a single species. Among the Ungulates\r\nthe reduction in the number of digits is especially noticeable; the\r\nforefoot of a pig has four digits, that of the cow two, and that of\r\nthe horse one. The two short \"splint\" bones in the horse are remnants\r\nof lost digits. The teeth are important structures in mammals, being\r\nused not only for tearing and masticating food, but as weapons of\r\noffence and defence. A tooth consists of an inner soft pulp (in old\r\nteeth the pulp may become converted into bone-like material)\r\nsurrounded by hard white dentine or ivory, which is covered by a thin\r\nlayer of enamel, the hardest tissue known in the animal body. A hard\r\ncement sometimes covers as a thin layer the outer surface of the root,\r\nand may also cover the enamel of the crown. The teeth in most forms\r\nare of three groups: (_a_) the incisors, with sharp cutting edges and\r\nsimple roots, situated in the centre of the jaw; (_b_) the canines,\r\noften conical and sharp-pointed, next to the incisors; (_c_) next the\r\nmolars, broad and flat-topped for grinding, and divided into premolars\r\nand true molars. There is great variety in the character and\r\narrangement of these structures in mammals, their variations being\r\nmuch used in classification. The number and arrangement of the teeth\r\nis expressed by a dental formula, as, for example, in the case of man\r\n\r\n     2--2     1--1     2--2     3--3\r\n  _i_----, _c_----, _p_----, _m_---- = 32.\r\n     2--2     1--1     2--2     3--3\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--A group of Rocky Mountain sheep, or \"big\r\nhorns,\" _Ovis canadensis_, including males, females and young.\r\n(Photograph by E. Willis from specimens mounted by Prof. L. L. Dyche,\r\nUniversity of Kansas.)]\r\n\r\nThe mouth is bounded by fleshy lips. On the floor of the mouth is the\r\ntongue, which bears the taste-buds or papillæ, the organs of taste.\r\nThe œsophagus is always a simple straight tube, but the stomach varies\r\ngreatly, being usually simple, but sometimes, as in the ruminants\r\nand whales, divided into several distinct chambers. The intestine in\r\nvegetarian mammals is very long, being in a cow twenty times the\r\nlength of the body. In the carnivores it is comparatively short--in a\r\ntiger, for example, but two or three times the length of the body.\r\n\r\nThe blood of mammals is warm, having a temperature of from 35° C. to\r\n40° C. (95° F. to 104° F.). It is red in color, owing to the\r\nreddish-yellow, circular, non-nucleated blood-corpuscles. The\r\ncirculation is double, the heart being composed of two distinct\r\nauricles and two distinct ventricles. Air is taken in through the\r\nnostrils or mouth and carried through the windpipe (trachea) and a\r\npair of bronchi to the lungs, where it gives up its oxygen to the\r\nblood, from which it takes up carbonic-acid gas in turn. At the upper\r\nend of the trachea is the larynx or voice-box, consisting of several\r\ncartilages attaching by one end to the vocal cords and by the other to\r\nmuscles. By the alteration of the relative position of these\r\ncartilages the cords can be tightened or relaxed, brought together or\r\nmoved apart, as required to modulate the tone and volume of the voice.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys of mammals are more compact and definite in form than those\r\nof other vertebrates. In all mammals except the Monotremes they\r\ndischarge their product through the paired ureters into a bladder,\r\nwhence the urine passes from the body by a single median urethra.\r\nMammary glands, secreting the milk by which the young are nourished\r\nduring the first period of their existence after birth, are present in\r\nboth sexes in all mammals, though usually functional in the female only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--A group of moose, _Alce americana_, showing\r\nmale, female, and young. (Photograph by E. Willis from specimens\r\nmounted by Prof. L. L. Dyche, University of Kansas.)]\r\n\r\nThe nervous system and the organs of special sense reach their highest\r\ndevelopment in the mammals. In them the brain is distinguished by its\r\nlarge size, and by the special preponderance of the forebrain or\r\ncerebral hemispheres over the mid- and hind-brain. Man's brain is\r\nmany times larger than that of all other known mammals of equal bulk\r\nof body, and three times as large as that of the largest-brained ape.\r\nIn man and the higher mammals the surface of the forebrain is thrown\r\ninto many convolutions; among the lowest the surface is smooth. Of the\r\norgans of special sense, those of touch consist of free nerve-endings\r\nor minute tactile corpuscles in the skin. The tactile sense is\r\nespecially acute in certain regions, as the lips and end of the snout\r\nin animals like hogs, the fingers in man, and the under surface of the\r\ntail in certain monkeys. All the other sense-organs are situated on\r\nthe head. The organs of taste are certain so-called taste-buds located\r\nin the mucous membrane covering certain papillæ on the surface of the\r\ntongue. The organ of smell, absent only in certain whales, consists of\r\na ramification of the olfactory nerves over a moist mucous membrane in\r\nthe nose. The ears of mammals are more highly developed than those of\r\nother vertebrates both in respect to the greater complexity of the\r\ninner part and the size of the outer part. A large outer ear for\r\ncollecting the sound-waves is present in all but a few mammals. A\r\ntympanic membrane separates it from the middle ear in which is a chain\r\nof three tiny bones leading from the tympanum to the inner ear,\r\ncomposed of the three semicircular canals and the spiral cochlea. The\r\neyes (fig. 150) have the structure characteristic of the vertebrate\r\neye, consisting of a movable eyeball composed of parts through which\r\nthe rays of light are admitted, regulated, and concentrated upon the\r\nsensitive expansion, retina, of the optic nerve lining the posterior\r\npart of the ball. The eye is protected by two movable lids. In almost\r\nall mammals below the Primates there is a third lid, the nictitating\r\nmembrane. In some burrowing rodents and others the eye is quite\r\nvestigial and even concealed beneath the skin.\r\n\r\n=Development and life-history.=--All mammals except the Monotremes\r\ngive birth to free young. The two genera of Monotremes produce their\r\nyoung from eggs hatched outside the body; _Tachyglossus_ lays one egg\r\nwhich it carries in an external pouch, while _Ornithorhynchus_\r\ndeposits two eggs in its burrow. The embryo of other mammals develops\r\nin the lower portion of the egg-tube, to the walls of which it is\r\nintimately connected by a membrane called the placenta. (In the\r\nkangaroos and opossums, Marsupialia, there is no placenta.) Through\r\nthis placenta blood-vessels extend from the body of the mother to the\r\nembryo, the young developing mammal thus deriving its nourishment\r\ndirectly from the parent.\r\n\r\nThe duration of gestation (embryonic or prenatal development in the\r\nmother's body) varies from three weeks with the mouse, eight weeks with\r\nthe cat, nine months with the stag, to twenty months with the elephant.\r\nLike the birds, the young of some mammals, the carnivores for example,\r\nare helpless at birth, while those of others, as the hoofed mammals, are\r\nvery soon able to run about. But all are nourished for a longer or\r\nshorter time by the milk secreted by the mammary gland of the mother.\r\n\r\n=Habits, instinct, and reason.=--Despite the wonderful examples of\r\ninstinct and intelligence shown by many insects and by the other\r\nvertebrates, especially the birds, it is among mammals that we find\r\nthe highest development of these qualities and of reason. In the wary\r\nand patient hunting for prey by the carnivora, in the gregarious and\r\naltruistic habits of the herding hoofed mammals, in the highly\r\ndeveloped and affectionate care of the young shown by most mammals,\r\nand in the loyal friendship and self-sacrifice of dogs and horses in\r\ntheir relations to man, we see the culmination among animals of the\r\ndevelopment of the functions of the nervous system. In the\r\ncharacteristics of intelligence and reason man of course stands\r\nimmensely superior to all other animals, but both intelligence and\r\nreason are too often shown by many of the other mammals not to make us\r\naware that man's mental powers differ only in degree, not in kind,\r\nfrom those of other animals.\r\n\r\nPure instinct is hereditary, and purely instinctive actions are common\r\nto all the individuals of a species. Those actions which the individual\r\ncould not learn by teaching, imitation, or experience are instinctive.\r\nThe accurate pecking at food by chicks just hatched from an incubator is\r\npurely instinctive. Purely instinctive also is the laying of eggs by a\r\nbutterfly on a certain species of plant which may have to be sought for\r\nover wide acres, so that the caterpillars when hatched shall find\r\nthemselves on their own special food-plant. Yet the butterfly never ate\r\nof this plant and will never see its young. Such elaborate instincts as\r\nthese have been developed from the simplest manifestations of sensation\r\nand nervous function, just as the complex structures of the body have\r\nbeen developed from simple structures (see Chapter XXIX).\r\n\r\nThe feeding and domestic habits and the whole general behavior of\r\nanimals are extremely interesting subjects of observation and study.\r\nAnd such observation intelligently pursued will be of much value. The\r\npoint to be kept ever in mind is that all animal habits are connected\r\nwith certain conditions of life; that in every case there is an answer\r\nto the question \"why.\" This answer may not be found; in many cases it\r\nis extremely difficult to get at, but often it is simple and obvious\r\nand can be found by the veriest beginner.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The mammals of North America represent eight orders.\r\nThree additional mammalian orders, namely, the Monotremata, including\r\nthe extraordinary duck-bills (_Ornithorhynchus_) and a species of\r\n_Tachyglossus_ in Australia and Tasmania; the Edentata, including the\r\nsloths, armadillos, and ant-eaters found in tropical regions; and the\r\nSirenia, including the marine manatees and dugongs, are not represented\r\n(except by a single manatee) in North America. In the following\r\nparagraphs some of the more familiar mammals representing each of the\r\neight orders represented in North America are referred to.\r\n\r\n=The opossums (Marsupialia).=--The opossum (_Didelphys virginiana_) is\r\nthe only North American representative of the order Marsupialia, the\r\nother members of which are limited exclusively to Australia and\r\ncertain neighboring islands. The kangaroos are the best known of the\r\nforeign marsupials. After birth the young are transferred to an\r\nexternal pouch, the marsupium, on the ventral surface of the mother,\r\nin which they are carried about and fed. The opossum lives in trees,\r\nis about the size of a common cat, and has a dirty-yellowish woolly\r\nfur. Its tail is long and scaly, like a rat's. Its food consists\r\nchiefly of insects, although small reptiles, birds, and bird's eggs\r\nare eaten. When ready to bear young the opossum makes a nest of dried\r\ngrass in the hollow of a tree, and produces about thirteen very small\r\n(half an inch long) helpless creatures. These are then placed by the\r\nmother in her pouch. Here they remain until two months or more after\r\nbirth. Probably all the North American opossums found from New York to\r\nCalifornia and especially common in the Southern States belong to a\r\nsingle species, but there is much variety among the individuals.\r\n\r\n=The rodents or gnawers (Glires).=--The rabbits, porcupines, gophers,\r\nchipmunks, beavers, squirrels, and rats and mice compose the largest\r\norder among the mammals. They are called the rodents or gnawers\r\n(Glires) because of their well-known gnawing powers and proclivities.\r\nThe special arrangement and character of the teeth are characteristic\r\nof this order. There are no canines, a toothless space being left\r\nbetween the incisors and molars on each side. There are only two\r\nincisor teeth in each jaw (rarely four in the upper jaw), and these\r\nteeth grow continuously and are kept sharp and of uniform length by\r\nthe gnawing on hard substances and the constant rubbing on each other.\r\nThe food of rodents is chiefly vegetable.\r\n\r\nOf the hares and rabbits the cottontail (_Lepus nuttalii_) and the\r\ncommon jack-rabbit (_L. campestris_) are the best known. The\r\ncottontail is found all over the United States, but shows some\r\nvariation in the different regions. There are several species of\r\njack-rabbits, all limited to the plains and mountain regions west of\r\nthe Mississippi River. The food of rabbits is strictly vegetable,\r\nconsisting of succulent roots, branches, or leaves. Rabbits are very\r\nprolific and yearly rear from three to six broods of from three to six\r\nyoung each. There are two North American species of porcupines, an\r\nEastern one, _Erethizon dorsatus_, and a Western one, _E. epixanthus_.\r\nThe quills in both these species are short, being only an inch or two\r\nin length, and are barbed. In some foreign porcupines they are a foot\r\nlong. They are loosely attached in the skin and may be readily pulled\r\nout, but they cannot be shot out by the porcupine, as is popularly\r\ntold. The little guinea-pigs (_Cavia_), kept as pets, are South\r\nAmerican animals related to the porcupines.\r\n\r\nThe pocket gophers, of which there are several species mostly\r\ninhabiting the central plains, are rodents found only in North\r\nAmerica. They all live underground, making extensive galleries and\r\nfeeding chiefly on bulbous roots. The mice and rats constitute a large\r\nfamily of which the house-mice and rats, the various field-mice, the\r\nwood-rat (_Neotoma pennsylvanica_) and the muskrat (_Fiber\r\nzibethicus_) are familiar representatives. The common brown rat (_Mus\r\ndecumanus_) was introduced into this country from Europe about 1775,\r\nand has now nearly wholly supplanted the black rat (_M. rattus_), also\r\na European species, introduced about 1544. The beaver (_Castor\r\ncanadensis_) is the largest rodent. It seems to be doomed to\r\nextermination through the relentless hunting of it for its fur. The\r\nwoodchuck or ground-hog (_Arctomys monax_) is another familiar rodent\r\nlarger than most members of the order. The chipmunks and\r\nground-squirrels are commonly known rodents found all over the\r\ncountry. They are the terrestrial members of the squirrel family, the\r\nbest known arboreal members of which are the red squirrel (_Sciurus\r\nhudsonicus_), the fox-squirrel (_S. ludovicianus_), and the gray or\r\nblack squirrel (_S. carolinensis_). The little flying squirrel\r\n(_Sciuropterus volans_) is abundant in the Eastern States.\r\n\r\n=The shrews and moles (Insectivora).=--The shrews and moles are all\r\nsmall carnivorous animals, which, because of their size, confine their\r\nattacks chiefly to insects. The shrews are small and mouse-like; certain\r\nkinds of them lead a semi-aquatic life. There are nearly a score of\r\nspecies in North America. Of the moles, of which there are but few\r\nspecies, the common mole (_Scalops aquaticus_) is well known, while the\r\nstar-nosed mole (_Condylura cristata_) is recognizable by the peculiar\r\nrosette of about twenty cartilaginous rays at the tip of its snout.\r\nMoles live underground and have the fore feet wide and shovel-like for\r\ndigging. The European hedgehogs are members of this order.\r\n\r\n=The bats (Chiroptera).=--The bats (fig. 153), order Chiroptera,\r\ndiffer from all other mammals in having the fore limbs modified for\r\nflight by the elongation of the forearms and especially of four of the\r\nfingers, all of which are connected by a thin leathery membrane which\r\nincludes also the hind feet and usually the tail. Bats are chiefly\r\nnocturnal, hanging head downward by their hind claws in caves, hollow\r\ntrees, or dark rooms through the day. They feed chiefly on insects,\r\nalthough some foreign kinds live on fruits. There are a dozen or more\r\nspecies of bats in North America, the most abundant kinds in the\r\nEastern States being the little brown bat (_Myotis subulatus_), about\r\nthree inches long with small fox-like face, high slender ears, and a\r\nuniform dull olive-brown color, and the red bat (_Lasiurus borealis_),\r\nnearly four inches long, covered with long, silky, reddish-brown fur,\r\nmostly white at tips of the hairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--The hoary bat, _Lasiurus cinereus_.\r\n(Photograph from life by J. O. Snyder.)]\r\n\r\n=The dolphins, porpoises, and whales (Cete).=--The dolphins,\r\nporpoises, and whales (Cete) compose an order of more or less\r\nfish-like aquatic mammals, among which are the largest of living\r\nanimals. In all the posterior limbs are wanting, and the fore limbs\r\nare developed as broad flattened paddles without distinct fingers or\r\nnails. The tail ends in a broad horizontal fin or paddle. The Cete are\r\nall predaceous, fish, pelagic crustaceans, and especially squids and\r\ncuttlefishes forming their principal food. Most of the species are\r\ngregarious, the individuals swimming together in \"schools.\" The\r\ndolphins and porpoises compose a family (Delphinidæ) including the\r\nsmaller and many of the most active and voracious of the Cete. The\r\nwhales compose two families, the sperm-whales (Physeteridæ) with\r\nnumerous teeth (in the lower jaw only) and the whalebone whales\r\n(Balænidæ) without teeth, their place being taken in the upper jaw by\r\nan array of parallel plates with fringed edges known as \"whalebone.\"\r\nThe great sperm-whales or cachalots (_Physeter macrocephalus_) found\r\nin southern oceans reach a length (males) of eighty feet, of which the\r\nhead forms nearly one-third. Of the whalebone whales, the\r\nsulphur-bottom (_Balænoptera sulfurea_) of the Pacific Ocean, reaching\r\na length of nearly one hundred feet, is the largest, and hence the\r\nlargest of all living animals. The common large whale of the Eastern\r\ncoast and North Atlantic is the right whale (_Balæna glacialis_); a\r\nnear relative is the great bowhead (_B. mysticetus_) of the Arctic\r\nseas, the most valuable of all whales to man. Whales are hunted for\r\ntheir whalebone and the oil yielded by their fat or blubber. The story\r\nof whale-fishing is an extremely interesting one, the great size and\r\nstrength of the \"game\" making the \"fishing\" a hazardous business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--Male elk or wapiti, _Cervus canadensis_.\r\n(Photograph by E. Willis from specimen mounted by Prof. L. L. Dyche,\r\nUniversity of Kansas.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--Antelope, male, female, and young,\r\n_Antilocapra americana_. (Photograph by E. Willis from specimens\r\nmounted by Prof. L. L. Dyche, University of Kansas.)]\r\n\r\n=The hoofed mammals (Ungulata).=--The order Ungulata includes some of\r\nthe most familiar mammal forms. Most of the domestic animals, as the\r\nhorse, cow, hog, sheep, and goat, belong to this order, as well as the\r\nfamiliar deer, antelope, and buffalo of our own land and the\r\nelephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffe, camel, zebra, etc.,\r\nfamiliar in zoological gardens and menageries. The order is a large\r\none, its members being characterized by the presence of from one to\r\nfour hooves, which are the enlarged and thickened claws of the toes.\r\nThe Ungulates are all herbivorous, and have their molar teeth fitted\r\nfor grinding, the canines being absent or small. The order is divided\r\ninto the Perissodactyla or odd-toed forms, like the horse, zebra,\r\ntapir, and rhinocerus, and the Artiodactyla or even-toed forms, like\r\nthe oxen, sheep, deer, camels, pigs, and hippopotami. The\r\nArtiodactyls comprise two groups, the Ruminants and Non-ruminants. All\r\nof the native Ungulata of our Northern States belong to the Ruminants,\r\nso called because of their habit of chewing a cud. A ruminant first\r\npresses its food into a ball, swallows it into a particular one of the\r\ndivisions of its four-chambered stomach, and later regurgitates it\r\ninto the mouth, thoroughly masticates it, and swallows it again, but\r\ninto another stomach-chamber. From this it passes through the other\r\ntwo into the intestine.\r\n\r\nThe deer family (Cervidæ) comprises the familiar Virginia or red deer\r\n(_Odocoileus americanus_) of the Eastern and Central States and the\r\nwhite-tailed, black-tailed, and mule deers of the West, the\r\ngreat-antlered elk or wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_) (fig. 154), the\r\ngreat moose (_Alce americana_) (fig. 152), largest of the deer family,\r\nand the American reindeer or caribou (_Rangifer caribou_). All species\r\nof the Cervidæ have solid horns, more or less branched, which are shed\r\nannually. Only the males (except with the reindeer) have horns. The\r\nantelope (_Antilocapra americana_) (fig. 155) common on the Western\r\nplains also sheds its horns, which, however, are not solid and do not\r\nbreak off at the base as in the deer, but are composed of an inner\r\nbony core and an outer horny sheath, the outer sheath only being shed.\r\nThe family Bovidæ includes the once abundant buffalo or bison (_Bison\r\nbison_) (frontispiece), the big-horn or Rocky Mountain sheep (_Ovis\r\ncanadensis_) (fig. 151), and the strange pure-white Rocky Mountain\r\ngoat (_Oreamnos montanus_). The buffalo was once abundant on the\r\nWestern plains, travelling in enormous herds. But so relentlessly has\r\nthis fine animal been hunted for its skin and flesh that it is now\r\npractically exterminated (fig. 156). A small herd is still to be found\r\nin Yellowstone Park, and a few individuals live in parks and\r\nzoological gardens. In all of the Bovidæ the horns are simple, hollow,\r\nand permanent, each enclosing a bony core.\r\n\r\n=The carnivorous mammals (Feræ).=--The order Feræ includes all those\r\nmammals usually called the carnivora, such as the lions, tigers, cats,\r\nwolves, dogs, bears, panthers, foxes, weasels, seals, etc. All of them\r\nfeed chiefly on animal substance and are predatory, pursuing and\r\nkilling their prey. They are mostly fur-covered and many are hunted\r\nfor their skin. They have never less than four toes, which are\r\nprovided with strong claws that are frequently more or less\r\nretractile. The canine teeth are usually large, curved, and pointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.--A buffalo, _Bison bison_, killed for its\r\nskin and tongue, on the plains of Western Kansas thirty years ago.\r\n(Photograph by J. Lee Knight.)]\r\n\r\nWhile most of the Feræ live on land, some are strictly aquatic. The true\r\nseals, fur-seals, sea-lions, and walruses comprise the aquatic forms,\r\nall being inhabitants of the ocean. The true seals, of which the common\r\nharbor seal (_Phoca vitulina_) is our most familiar representative, have\r\nthe limbs so thoroughly modified for swimming that they are useless on\r\nland. The fur-seals, sea-lions, and walruses use the hind legs to\r\nscramble about on the rocks or beaches of the shore. The fur-seals\r\n(fig. 157) live gregariously in great rookeries on the Pribilof or Fur\r\nSeal Islands, and the Commander Islands in Bering Sea.\r\n\r\nThe bears are represented in our country by the widespread brown,\r\nblack, or cinnamon bear (_Ursus americanus_) and the huge grizzly bear\r\n(_U. horribilis_) of the West. The great polar bear (_Thalarctos\r\nmaritimus_) lives in arctic regions. The otters, skunks, badgers,\r\nwolverines, sables, minks, and weasels compose the family Mustelidæ,\r\nwhich includes most of the valuable fur-bearing animals. Some of the\r\nmembers of this family lead a semi-aquatic or even strictly aquatic\r\nlife and have webbed feet. The wolves, foxes, and dogs belong to the\r\nfamily Canidæ. The coyote (_Canis latrans_), the gray wolf (_C.\r\nnubilus_), and the red fox (_Vulpes pennsylvanicus_) are the most\r\nfamiliar representatives of this family, in addition to the dog (_C.\r\nfamiliaris_), which is closely allied to the wolf. \"Most carnivorous\r\nof the carnivora, formed to devour, with every offensive weapon\r\nspecialized to its utmost, the Felidæ, whether large or small, are,\r\nrelatively to their size, the fiercest, strongest, and most terrible\r\nof beasts.\" The Felidæ or cat family includes the lions, tigers,\r\nhyenas, leopards, jaguars, panthers, wildcats, and lynxes. In this\r\ncountry the most formidable of the Felidæ is the American panther or\r\npuma (_Felis concolor_). It reaches a length from nose to root of tail\r\nof over four feet. Its tail is long. The wildcat (_Lynx rufus_) is\r\nmuch smaller and has a short tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.--The Lukanin rookery of fur seals,\r\n_Callorhinus alascanus_, on St. Paul Island, Pribilof Group, Bering\r\nSea. (Photograph from life by the Fur Seal Commission.)]\r\n\r\n=The man-like mammals (Primates).=--The Primates, the highest order of\r\nmammals, includes the lemurs, monkeys, baboons, apes, and men. Man\r\n(_Homo sapiens_) is the only native representative of this order in\r\nour country. All the races and kinds of men known, although really\r\nshowing much variety in appearance and body structure, are commonly\r\nincluded in one species. The chief structural characteristics which\r\ndistinguish man from the other members of this order are the great\r\ndevelopment of his brain and the non-opposability of his great toe.\r\nDespite the similarity in general structure between him and the\r\nanthropoid apes of the Old World, in particular the chimpanzee and\r\norang-outang, the disparity in size of brain is enormous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.--\"Bob Jordan,\" a monkey of the genus\r\n_Cercopithecus_. (Photograph from life by D. S. Jordan.)]\r\n\r\nThe lowest Primates are the lemurs found in Madagascar, in which\r\nisland they include about one-half of all the mammalian species found\r\nthere. The brain is much less developed in the lemurs than in any of\r\nthe other monkeys. The monkeys and apes may be divided into two\r\ngroups, the lower, platyrrhine monkeys, found in the New World, and\r\nthe higher, catarrhine forms, limited to the Old World. The\r\nplatyrrhine monkeys have wide noses in which the nostrils are\r\nseparated by a broad septum and with the openings directed laterally.\r\nThese monkeys are mostly smaller and weaker than the Old World forms\r\nand are always long-tailed, the tail being frequently prehensile. They\r\ninclude the howling, squirrel, spider, and capuchin monkeys common in\r\nthe forests of tropical South America. The catarrhine monkeys have the\r\nnose-septum narrow and the openings of the nostrils directed forwards,\r\nand the tail is wanting in numerous members of the group. They include\r\nthe baboons, gorillas, orang-outangs, and chimpanzees. These apes have\r\na dentition approaching that of man, and in all ways are the animals\r\nwhich most nearly resemble man in physical character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART III\r\n\r\n                             ANIMAL ECOLOGY\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE, ADAPTATION,\r\n                          AND SPECIES-FORMING\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--Multiplication, or increase by geometric ratio,\r\n    among animals can be illustrated by noting the many eggs laid by a\r\n    single female moth or beetle or fly or mosquito or any other\r\n    common insect (or almost any other non-mammalian animal). The\r\n    production of many live young by each female rose aphid can be\r\n    readily seen; the number of young in a litter of kittens or pups\r\n    or rabbits is a good illustration. From this geometric increase it\r\n    is obvious that there must be a great crowding of animals and a\r\n    struggle among them for existence. This struggle and the downfall\r\n    of the many and success of the victorious few can be observed by\r\n    rearing in a small jar of water all the young of a single brood of\r\n    water-tigers (larva of _Dyticus_) or other aquatic predaceous\r\n    insect. The strongest young will live by killing and eating the\r\n    weaker of their own kind. In a spider's egg-sac the young after\r\n    hatching do not immediately leave the sac, but remain in it for\r\n    several days. During this time they live on each other, the\r\n    strongest feeding on the weaker. Thus out of many spiderlings\r\n    hatched in each sac comparatively few issue. This can be readily\r\n    observed. Open several egg-sacs and count the eggs in them. Let\r\n    the spiderlings hatch and issue from some other egg-sacs belonging\r\n    to the same species of spider. The number of issuing spiderlings\r\n    will always be much less than that of the eggs. The actual working\r\n    of natural selection and the forming of new species can of course\r\n    be seen only in results, and not in process. The great variety of\r\n    adaptation, the fitness of adaptive structures, can be readily\r\n    illustrated among the commonest animals. Animals showing certain\r\n    striking and unusual adaptations will perhaps make the matter more\r\n    obvious. To all teachers will occur numerous opportunities of\r\n    illustrating, by reference to actual processes or to obvious\r\n    results, the principles of this chapter.\r\n\r\n=The multiplication and crowding of animals.=--In the reproduction or\r\nmultiplication of animals the production of young proceeds in\r\ngeometric ratio, that is, it is truly a multiplication. Any species of\r\nanimal, if its multiplication proceeded unchecked, would sooner or\r\nlater be sufficiently numerous to populate exclusively the whole\r\nworld. The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known\r\nanimals. It begins breeding when thirty years old and goes on breeding\r\nuntil ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and\r\nsurviving until a hundred years old. Thus after about eight hundred\r\nyears there would be, if all the individuals lived to their normal age\r\nlimit, 19,000,000 elephants alive descended from the first pair. A few\r\nyears more of unchecked multiplication of the elephant and every foot\r\nof land on the earth would be covered by them. But the rate of\r\nmultiplication of other animals varies from a little to very much\r\ngreater than that of the elephant. It has been shown that at the\r\nnormal rate in increase in English sparrows, if none were to die save\r\nof old age, it would take but twenty years to give one sparrow to\r\nevery square inch in the State of Indiana. The rate of increase of an\r\nanimal, each pair producing ten pairs annually and each animal living\r\nten years, is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  Years.     Pairs produced.          Pairs alive at end of year.\r\n\r\n    1                  10                                     11\r\n    2                 110                                    121\r\n    3               1,210                                  1,331\r\n    4              13,310                                 14,641\r\n    5             146,410                                161,051\r\n   10              ......                         25,937,424,600\r\n   20              ......            700,000,000,000,000,000,000\r\n\r\nSome animals produce vast numbers of eggs or young; for example, the\r\nherring, 20,000; a certain eel, several millions; and the oyster from\r\n500,000 to 16,000,000. Supposing we start with one oyster and let it\r\nproduce one million of eggs. Let each egg produce an oyster which in\r\nturn produces[19] one million of eggs, and let these go on increasing\r\nat the same rate. In the second generation there would be one million\r\nmillion of oysters, and in the fourth, i.e. the great great\r\ngrandchildren of the first oyster, there would be one million million\r\nmillion million of oysters. The shells of these oysters would just\r\nabout make a mass the size of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut it is obvious that all the new individuals of any animal produced do\r\nnot live their normal duration of life. All animals produce far more\r\nyoung than can survive. As a matter of fact, which we may verify by\r\nobservation, the number of individuals of animals in a state of nature\r\nis, in general, about stationary. There are about as many squirrels in\r\nthe forest one year as another, about as many butterflies in the field,\r\nabout as many frogs in the pond. Some species increase in numbers, as\r\nfor example, the rabbit in Australia, which was introduced there in 1860\r\nand in fifteen years had become so abundant as to be a great pest. Other\r\nspecies decrease, as the buffaloes, which once roamed our great plains\r\nin enormous herds and are now represented by a total of a few hundred\r\nindividuals, and the passenger-pigeon, whose migrating flocks ten years\r\nago darkened the air for hours in parts of the Mississippi valley, where\r\nnow it is a rare bird. But the hand of man is the agent which has helped\r\nto increase or to check the multiplication of these animals. In nature\r\nsuch quick changes rarely occur.\r\n\r\n=The struggle for existence.=--The numbers of animals are stationary\r\nbecause of the tremendous mortality occasioned by the constant preying\r\non eggs and young and adults by other animals, because of strenuous and\r\ndestructive climatic and meteorological conditions, and because there is\r\nnot space and food for all born, not even, indeed, for all of a single\r\nspecies, let alone all of the hundreds of thousands of species which now\r\ninhabit the earth. There is thus constantly going on among animals a\r\nfearful _struggle for existence_. In the case of any individual this\r\nstruggle is threefold: (1) with the other individuals of his own species\r\nfor food and space; (2) with the individuals of other species, which\r\nprey on him, or serve as his prey, or for food and space; and (3)\r\nfinally with the conditions of life, as with the cold of winter, the\r\nheat of summer, or drouth and flood. Sometimes one of these struggles is\r\nthe severer, sometimes another. With the communal animals the struggle\r\namong individuals is lessened--they help each other; but when the\r\nstruggle with the conditions of life are easiest, as in the tropics or\r\nin the ocean, the struggle among individuals becomes intensified. Each\r\nstrives to feed itself, to save its own life, to produce and safeguard\r\nits young. But in spite of all their efforts only a few individuals out\r\nof the hosts produced live to maturity. The great majority are destroyed\r\nin the egg or in adolescence.\r\n\r\n=Variation and natural selection.=--What individuals survive of the many\r\nwhich are born? Those best fitted for life; those which are a little\r\nstronger, a little swifter, a little hardier, a little less readily\r\nperceived by their enemies, than the others. They are the winners in the\r\nstruggle for existence; they are the survivors. And this survival of the\r\nfittest, as it is called, is practically a process of selection by\r\nNature. Nature selects the fittest to live and to perpetuate the\r\nspecies. Their progeny again undergo the struggle and the selecting\r\nprocess, and again the fittest live. And so on until adjustment or\r\nharmonizing of animals' bodies and habits with the conditions of life,\r\nwith their environment, comes to be extremely fine and nearly perfect.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, of course, that such a natural selection or survival of\r\nthe fittest and consequent adaptation to environment presupposes\r\ndifferences among the individuals of a species. And this is an\r\nobserved fact. No two individuals, although of the same brood, are\r\nexactly alike at birth; there always exist slight variations in\r\nstructure and performance of functions. And these slight variations\r\nare the differences which determine the fate of the individual. One\r\nindividual is a little larger or stronger or swifter or hardier than\r\nits mates. The existence of this variation we know from our\r\nobservation of the young kittens or puppies of a brood. So it is with\r\nall animals. Thus natural selection depends upon two factors, namely,\r\nthe excess in the production of new individuals and the consequent\r\nstruggle for existence among them, and the existence of variations\r\nwhich give certain individuals slight advantages in this struggle.\r\n\r\n=Adaptation and adjustment to surroundings.=--The action of natural\r\nselection obviously must, and does, result in a fine adaptation and\r\nadjustment of the structure and habits of animals to their\r\nsurroundings. If a certain species or group of individuals cannot\r\nadapt itself to its environment, it will be crowded out by others that\r\ncan. A slight advantageous variation comes in time by the continuously\r\nselective process to be a well-developed adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe diverse forms and habits possessed by animals are chiefly\r\nadaptations to their special conditions of life. The talons and beak\r\nof the eagle, the fishing-pouch of the pelican, the piercing\r\nchisel-like bill of the woodpecker, and the sensitive probing-bill of\r\nthe snipe are adaptations connected with the special feeding habits of\r\nthese birds. The quills of the porcupine, the poison-fangs of the\r\nrattlesnake, the sting of the yellow-jacket, and the antlers of the\r\ndeer are adaptations for self-defence. The fins and gills of fishes,\r\nthe shovel-like fore feet of the mole, the wings of birds and insects\r\nand bats, the toe-pads of the tree-toad, the leaping-legs of the\r\ngrasshopper, all these are adaptations concerned with the special\r\nlife-surroundings of these animals.\r\n\r\nAdaptations may relate to habits and behavior as well as to structure.\r\nPlainly adaptive are such habits as the migration of birds and some\r\nother animals, most of the habits connected with food-getting, and\r\nespecially striking and interesting those connected with the production\r\nand care of the young, including nest-making and home-building.\r\n\r\n=Species-forming.=--It is evident that through the cumulative action\r\nof natural selection, animals of a structural type considerably (even\r\nunlimitedly) different from any original type may in time be produced\r\nby the gradual modification of the original type under new conditions.\r\nIf, for example, a few individuals of a mainland species should come\r\nto be thrown as waifs of wave and storm upon an island, and if these\r\nshould be able to maintain themselves there and produce young,\r\nincreasing so as to occupy the new territory, there would be produced\r\nin time a new type of individual conforming or adapted to the\r\nconditions obtaining in the island, these conditions being, of course,\r\nalmost certainly different from those of the mainland. Thus as an\r\noffshoot or derivation from the original type still existing on the\r\nmainland we should have the new island-inhabiting type. Now when these\r\nisland individuals come to differ so much, structurally and\r\nphysiologically, from the mainland type that they cannot, even if\r\nopportunity offers, successfully mate or interbreed with mainland\r\nindividuals the island type constitutes a new species. That is, our\r\ndistinction between species rests not only on structural differences,\r\nbut on the impossibility of interbreeding (at least for the production\r\nof fertile young). Such a combination of the action of natural\r\nselection and the condition of isolation (as illustrated by the case\r\nof island animals), is probably the most potent factor in the\r\nproduction of new species of animals (and plants).\r\n\r\nFor accounts of the struggle for existence, variations, adaptations,\r\nnatural selection and species-forming see Darwin's \"Origin of Species,\"\r\nWallace's \"Island Life,\" and Romanes' \"Darwin and After Darwin,\" I.\r\n\r\n=Artificial selection.=--When a selection among the individuals of a\r\nspecies, that is, the choosing and preserving of individuals which\r\nshow a certain trait or traits and the destroying of those individuals\r\nnot possessing this trait, is done by man, it is called artificial\r\nselection. To artificial selection we chiefly owe all the many races\r\nor varieties of our domesticated animals and plants. For example, from\r\nthe ancestral jungle fowl have been developed by artificial selection\r\n(and by cross-breeding) all our kinds of domestic fowl, as Brahmas,\r\nblack Spanish, bantams, game-cocks, etc.; from the wild rock-dove have\r\nbeen developed our various fancy pigeons, as carriers, pouters,\r\nfantails, etc.\r\n\r\nFor an account of artificial selection see Darwin's \"Plants and Animals\r\nunder Domestication,\" and Romanes' \"Darwin and After Darwin,\" I.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[19] Oysters are hermaphroditic, each individual producing both sperm-\r\nand egg-cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                 SOCIAL AND COMMUNAL LIFE, COMMENSALISM\r\n                             AND PARASITISM\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Social life and gregariousness.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Students should\r\n    refer to examples of gregariousness from their own observations of\r\n    animals. The roosting together of crows and of blackbirds; the\r\n    gathering of swallows preparatory to migration; the flocking of\r\n    geese and ducks, with leaders, in their migratory flights, all can\r\n    be readily observed. From observation or general reading students\r\n    will be more or less familiar with prairie-dog villages, beaver-dams\r\n    and marshes, the one-time great herds of bison, etc.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for existence is always operative; but in some cases one\r\nor more phases of it may be ameliorated. For example, the amelioration\r\nof the struggle among individuals of one species obtains in a lesser\r\nor greater degree in the case of those animals which exhibit a _social\r\nlife_, of which mutual aid and mutual dependence are the basis. The\r\nhoney-bee and the ants are familiar examples of animals which show a\r\nhigh degree of social life. They live, indeed, a truly communal life,\r\nwhere the fate of the individual is bound up in the fate of the\r\ncommunity. But there are many animals which show a much lower degree\r\nof mutual aid and a far less coherent society. The simplest form of\r\nsocial life exists among those animals in which many individuals of\r\none species keep together, forming a great band or herd. In this case\r\nthere is not nearly so much mutual aid or mutual dependence as in that\r\nof the honey-bee, and the safety of the individual is not wholly bound\r\nup in the fate of the herd. Such animals are said to be _gregarious_\r\nin habit, and this gregariousness is undoubtedly advantageous to the\r\nindividuals of the band. The great herds of reindeer in the North, and\r\nof the bison or buffalo which once ranged over the Western American\r\nplains are examples of a gregariousness in which mutual protection\r\nfrom enemies, like wolves, seems to be the principal advantage gained.\r\nThe bands of wolves which hunted the buffalo show the advantage of\r\nmutual help in aggression as well as in protection. Prairie-dogs live\r\nin great villages or communities which spread over many acres. By\r\nshrill cries they tell each other of the approach of enemies, and they\r\nseem to visit each other and to enjoy each other's society a great\r\ndeal, although that they are thus afforded much actual active help is\r\nnot apparent. The beavers furnish a well-known and very interesting\r\nexample of mutual help; they exhibit a communal life although a simple\r\none. They live in villages or communities, all helping to build the\r\ndam across the stream which is necessary to form the marsh or pool in\r\nwhich the nests or houses are built.\r\n\r\n    =Communal life.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--See technical notes, pp. 212\r\n    _et seq_, for directions for work in connection with the study of\r\n    the communal life of ants, bees, and wasps.\r\n\r\nWhen many individuals of a species live together in a community in which\r\nthe different kinds of work are divided more or less distinctly among\r\nthe different members and where each individual works primarily for the\r\nwhole and not for himself; where there is, in other words, a thorough\r\nmutual help and mutual dependence among the members of the community\r\naccompanied by a division of labor, the life of the species is truly\r\ncommunal. Those animals which show the most elaborate and specialized\r\n_communal life_ are the termites or white ants, the social bees and\r\nwasps, and the true ants. Of these the ants and honey-bees stand first.\r\nAs already explained (see pp. 220 _et seq_), there are among these\r\ncommunal insects several different kinds of individuals in each species.\r\nWith most animals there are two kinds only, males and females, which may\r\nor may not show differences in color, form, etc., so that they are\r\nreadily distinguishable. Among all the communal insects, however, there\r\nare always three kinds of individuals, males, females, and workers,\r\nthese last being infertile individuals. With the social wasps and social\r\nbees the workers are all infertile females and are smaller than the\r\nfertile forms; with the termites there are besides the fertile males and\r\nfemales, which are winged, workers which are wingless, and also peculiar\r\nwingless individuals called soldiers which have very large jaws and\r\nwhose business it is to fight off attacking enemies of the community.\r\nAmong the ants the workers are also wingless, while the males and\r\nfemales are winged. The worker ants in many species are of two kinds,\r\nso-called worker majors and worker minors, differing markedly in size.\r\nAll the ant workers are good soldiers, but with some the fighting is\r\ndone almost wholly by certain especially large-headed and large-jawed\r\nones which may be called soldier-workers.\r\n\r\nThus among all strictly communal animals there is a specialization or\r\ndifferentiation of individuals accompanying the division of labor.\r\nSpecial individuals have a certain part of the work of the community\r\nto do, and they are specially modified in structure to do this work.\r\nThis structural modification may make them incapable of performing\r\ncertain other labor or work which is necessary for their living and\r\nwhich must be done for them, therefore, by others. Thus the mutual\r\ninterdependence of the individuals composing a colony is very real.\r\nThe worker honey-bees cannot perpetuate the species; honey-bees would\r\ndie out were it not for the males and females. But the males and\r\nfemales have given up the functions of food-getting and of caring for\r\ntheir young; did not the workers do these things for them, the\r\ncommunity would die out quite as soon.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of communal or social life, of co-operation and mutual\r\naid are real. Those animals that have adopted such a life are among\r\nthe most successful of all in the struggle for existence. The termite\r\nworker is one of the most defenseless and for those animals that prey\r\non insects one of the most toothsome insects, and yet the termite is\r\none of the most abundant and successfully living insect kinds in all\r\nthe tropics. Ants are everywhere and are everywhere successful. The\r\nhoney-bee is a popular type of successful life. The artificial\r\nprotection afforded it by man may aid it in its struggle for\r\nexistence, but it gains this protection because of certain features of\r\nits communal life, and in nature the honey-bee takes care of itself\r\nwell. Co-operation and mutual aid are among the most important factors\r\nwhich help in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n    =Commensalism.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--Examine ants' nests to find\r\n    myrmecophilous insects. If on the seashore search for hermit-crabs\r\n    with sea-anemones on shell. If inland, try to have some preserved\r\n    specimens showing the crabs and sea-anemones.\r\n\r\nThe phases of living together and mutual help just discussed concerned\r\nin each instance a single species of animal. All the members of a pack\r\nof wolves or of a honey-bee community belong to a single species. But\r\nthere are numerous instances known of the mutually advantageous\r\nassociation of individuals of two different species. Such an\r\nassociation is called _commensalism_ or _symbiosis_.\r\n\r\nThe hermit-crabs live, as has been learned (p. 154), in the shells of\r\nmolluscs, most of the body of the crab being concealed within the\r\nshell, only the head and the grasping and walking legs protruding. In\r\nsome species of hermit-crabs there is always to be found on the shell\r\nnear the opening a sea-anemone. \"This sea-anemone is carried from\r\nplace to place by the crab, and in this way is much aided in obtaining\r\nfood. On the other hand, the crab is protected from its enemies by the\r\nwell-armed and dangerous tentacles of its companion. On the tentacles\r\nthere are many thousand long slender stinging threads, and the fish\r\nthat would eat the hermit-crab must first deal with the stinging\r\nanemone.\" If the sea-anemone be torn away from the shell the crab will\r\nwander about seeking another anemone. When he finds one, he struggles\r\nto loosen it from the rock to which it is attached, and does not rest\r\nuntil he has torn it loose and placed it on his shell.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the hermit-crab and the sea-anemone there is no doubt\r\nof the mutual advantage derived from their communal life. But this\r\nmutual advantage is not so obvious in some cases of commensalism,\r\nwhere indeed most or all of the advantage often seems to lie with one\r\nof the animals, while the other derives little or none, but on the\r\nother hand suffers no injury. For example, \"small fish of the genus\r\n_Nomeus_ may often be found accompanying the beautiful Portuguese\r\nman-of-war (_Physalia_) as it sails slowly about on the ocean's\r\nsurface. These little fish lurk underneath the float among the various\r\nhanging thread-like parts of the man-of-war which are provided with\r\nstinging cells. They are protected from their enemies by their\r\nproximity to these stinging threads, but of what advantage to the\r\nman-of-war their presence is is not understood.\" Similarly in the\r\nnests of the various species of ants and termites many different kinds\r\nof other insects have been found. \"Some of these are harmful to their\r\nhosts, in that they feed on the food-stores gathered by the\r\nindustrious and provident ant, but others appear to feed only on\r\nrefuse or useless substances in the nest. Some may be of help to their\r\nhosts by acting as scavengers. Over one thousand species of these\r\nmyrmecophilous (ant-loving) and termitophilous (termite-loving)\r\ninsects have been recorded by collectors as living habitually in the\r\nnests of ants and termites.\"\r\n\r\n    =Parasitism.=--TECHNICAL NOTE.--As examples of temporary external\r\n    parasites find and examine fleas and ticks on dogs and cats, red\r\n    mites on house-flies and grasshoppers (at the bases of the wings),\r\n    etc. As examples of permanent external parasites find bird-lice on\r\n    pigeons or domestic fowls or on other birds. Note the absence of\r\n    wings and the peculiarly modified body shape of these parasites.\r\n    Examine a bird-louse under the microscope; note the absence of\r\n    compound eyes (it has simple eyes) and absence of wings; note bits\r\n    of feathers, its food, in stomach, showing through the body. Find,\r\n    as examples of internal parasites, intestinal worms or flukes.\r\n    Examine trichinized pork to see _Trichinæ_ in muscles. Examine\r\n    preserved specimens of tapeworms. Collect pupæ of some common\r\n    butterfly or moth and keep them in the schoolroom until either the\r\n    butterflies or ichneumon flies issue. Some will surely be\r\n    parasitized, and yield ichneumon flies (parasites) instead of a\r\n    butterfly. As examples of degeneration by quiescence examine\r\n    barnacles (found on outer rocks of seashore at low tide; easily\r\n    obtained as preserved specimens by inland schools) and the females\r\n    of scale-insects. These insects may be found on oleanders (the\r\n    black scale, _Lecanium oleæ_) or fruit-trees (the San Jose scale,\r\n    _Aspidiotus perniciosus_). Note the great degeneration of the\r\n    adult female of the San Jose scale; it has no eyes, antennæ,\r\n    wings, or legs. The young may be found crawling about at certain\r\n    times of the year; they have eyes, antennæ and legs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the various ways of living together among animals,\r\nalready described, namely, the social and communal life of individuals\r\nof a single species and the commensal and symbiotic life of\r\nindividuals of different species, there is another and very common\r\nkind of association among animals. This is the association of parasite\r\nand host; the association between two sorts of animals whereby one,\r\nthe parasite, lives on or in the other, the host, and at the expense\r\nof the host. In this association the parasite gains advantages great\r\nor small, sometimes even obtaining all the necessities of life, while\r\nthe host gains nothing, but suffers corresponding disadvantage, often\r\neven the loss of life itself. _Parasitism_ is a phenomenon common in\r\nall the large groups of animals, though the parasites themselves are\r\nmostly invertebrates. There are parasitic Protozoa, worms,\r\ncrustaceans, insects, and molluscs, and a few vertebrates.\r\n\r\nSome parasites, like the fleas and lice, live on the surface of the body\r\nof the host. These are called _external parasites_. Others, as the\r\ntapeworms, live exclusively inside the body; such are called _internal\r\nparasites_. Again, some, as the bird-lice, which are external parasites\r\nfeeding on the feathers of birds, spend their whole lifetime on the\r\nhost; they are called _permanent parasites_. Others, as a flea, which\r\nleaps on or off its host as caprice directs, or like certain parasites\r\nwhich as young live free and active lives, finally attaching themselves\r\nto some host and remaining fixed there for the rest of their lives, are\r\ncalled _temporary parasites_. Such a grouping is purely arbitrary and\r\nexists simply for the sake of convenience. It is not rigid, nor does it\r\nclass parasites in their proper natural groups.\r\n\r\nWhen various parasites are examined it will be noted that practically in\r\nall cases the body of a parasite is simpler in structure than the body\r\nof other animals closely related to it; that is, species which live\r\nparasitically, obtaining their food from and being carried about by a\r\nhost, have simpler bodies than related forms that live free active\r\nlives, competing for food with other animals about them. This simplicity\r\nis not primitive, but results from the loss or atrophy of the structures\r\nwhich the special mode of life of the parasite renders useless. Many\r\nparasites are attached firmly by hooks or suckers to their host, and do\r\nnot move about independently of it. They have no need of the power of\r\nlocomotion, and accordingly are usually without wings, legs, or other\r\nlocomotory organs. Because they have no need of locomotion they have no\r\nneed of organs of orientation, those special sense organs like the eyes,\r\nears, and feelers which serve to guide and direct the moving animal; and\r\nmost fixed parasites will be found to have no eyes, or any of those\r\norgans accessory to locomotion, and which serve for the detection of\r\nfood or of enemies. Because these important organs, which depend for\r\ntheir successful activity on a well-organized nervous system, are\r\nlacking, the nervous system of parasites is usually very simple. Again,\r\nbecause the parasite usually feeds on the already digested food or the\r\nblood of its host, most parasites have a very simple alimentary canal,\r\nor even none at all. Finally, as the fixed parasite leads a wholly\r\nsedentary and inactive life, the breaking down and rebuilding of tissue\r\nin its body goes on very slowly and in minimum degree, so that there is\r\nlittle need of highly developed respiratory and circulatory systems; and\r\nmost fixed and internal parasites have these systems of organs decidedly\r\nsimplified. Altogether the body of a fixed permanent parasite is so\r\nsimplified and so wanting in all those special structures which\r\ncharacterize the active, complex animals that it often presents a very\r\ndifferent appearance from those forms with which we know it to be nearly\r\nrelated. This simplicity due to loss or reduction of parts is called\r\n_degeneration_. Such simplicity of body-structure due to degeneration\r\nis, however, essentially different in its origin from the simplicity of\r\nthe lower simpler animals. In them the simplicity of body is primitive;\r\nthey are generalized animals; the simplicity of degeneration is\r\nacquired; it is really an adaptation, or specialization.\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of body degeneration due to the adoption of a\r\nparasitic habit is that of _Sacculina_ (fig. 159), a crustacean\r\nparasitic on other crustaceans, namely, crabs. The young _Sacculina_\r\nis an active, free-swimming larva essentially like a young prawn or\r\ncrab. After a short period of independent existence it attaches itself\r\nto the abdomen of a crab, and lives as a parasite. It completes its\r\ndevelopment under the influence of this parasitic life, and when adult\r\nbears absolutely no resemblance to such a typical crustacean as a crab\r\nor crayfish. Its body external to the host crab is simply a pulsating\r\ntumor-like sac, with no mouth-parts, no legs, and internally hardly\r\nany well-developed organs except those of reproduction. Degeneration\r\nhere is carried very far.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--_Sacculina_, a parasitic crustacean; _A_,\r\nattached to a crab, the root-like processes of the parasite\r\npenetrating the body of the host; _B_, the active larval condition;\r\n_C_, the adult removed from its host. (After Haeckel.)]\r\n\r\nVarious parasites have been referred to in Part II under their proper\r\nbranch and class. The worms include an unusually large number of them,\r\nsuch as the tapeworms, trichinæ and other intestinal forms, all of\r\nwhich live as internal parasites in the alimentary canal or in other\r\norgans of higher animals, especially the vertebrates. Many crustaceans\r\nare parasitic, usually living, like the fish-lice, as fixed external\r\nparasites on fishes, other crustaceans, etc., but with a free and\r\nactive larval stage. Among the insects, on the contrary, many of the\r\nparasitic forms (as the ichneumon flies) are free and active in the\r\nadult stage, but live as internal grubs or maggots in the larval\r\nstage. The ichneumon flies (of the order Hymenoptera) are four-winged,\r\nslender-bodied insects which lay their eggs either on or in (by means\r\nof a sharp piercing ovipositor) some caterpillar or beetle grub, into\r\nthe body of which the young grub-like ichneumon larvæ burrow on\r\nhatching. The parasites feed on the body-tissues of the host, not\r\nattacking, however, such organs as the heart or nervous system, which\r\nwould produce the immediate death of the host. The caterpillar lives\r\nwith the ichneumon grubs within it usually until nearly time for its\r\npupation. Often, indeed, it pupates with the parasite still in its\r\nbody. But it never comes to maturity. The larval ichneumons pupate\r\neither within the body of its host, or in a tiny silken cocoons\r\noutside of its body (fig. 160). From the cocoons the winged adult\r\nichneumons issue; and after mating the females find another\r\ncaterpillar on whose body to lay their eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.--Larva of a sphinx-moth, with cocoons of a\r\nparasitic ichneumon fly. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nDegeneration can be produced by other causes than parasitism. It is\r\nevident that if for any other reason an animal should adopt an\r\ninactive fixed life it would degenerate. The barnacles (see fig. 37)\r\nare excellent examples of degeneration through quiescence. They are\r\ncrustaceans related most nearly to the crabs and shrimps. The young\r\nbarnacle just from the egg is a six-legged, free-swimming larva\r\n(nauplius) with a single eye, greatly like a young prawn or crab. It\r\ndevelops during its independent life two compound eyes and two large\r\nantennæ. But soon it attaches itself to some stone or shell, or pile\r\nor ship's bottom, giving up its power of locomotion, and its further\r\ndevelopment is a degeneration. It loses its compound eyes and antennæ,\r\nand acquires a protecting shell. Its swimming feet become modified\r\ninto grasping organs, and it loses most of its outward resemblance to\r\nthe typical members of its class. The Tunicata or ascidians compose a\r\nwhole group of animals which are fixed in their adult condition and\r\nhave thus become degenerate. They have been likened to a \"mere rooted\r\nbag with a double neck.\" In their young stage they are free-swimming,\r\nactive, tadpole-like or fish-like larvæ, possessing organs much like\r\nthose of the adult simplest fish or fish-like animals. Their larval\r\nstructure reveals, however, the relationships of the ascidians to the\r\nvertebrates, a relationship which is not at all apparent in the\r\ndegenerate adults. Certain insects live sedentary or fixed lives. All\r\nthe members of one large family, the Coccidæ, or scale-insects (figs.\r\n62 and 63), have females which as adults are wingless and in some\r\ncases have no legs, eyes, or antennæ, while the males are all winged\r\nand have legs and the special sense organs. The males lead a free\r\nactive life, but the females have nearly or quite given up the power\r\nof locomotion, attaching themselves by means of their sucking beak to\r\nsome plant, where they obtain a sufficient food-supply (plant-sap) and\r\nlay their eggs. In both males and females the larvæ are little active\r\ncrawling six-legged creatures with legs, eyes, and antennæ.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed perhaps to think of degeneration as necessarily\r\nimplying a disadvantage in life. It is true that a blind, footless,\r\ndegenerate animal could not cope with the active, keen-sighted, highly\r\norganized non-degenerate in free competition. But free competition is\r\nexactly what the degenerate animal has nothing to do with. Certainly the\r\n_Sacculina_ and the scale-insects live well; they are admirably adapted\r\nto the kind of life they lead. A parasite enjoys certain obvious\r\nadvantages in life, and even extreme degeneration is no drawback (except\r\nas we shall see later), but gives it a body which demands less food and\r\ncare. As long as the host is successful in eluding its enemies and\r\navoiding accident and injury the parasite is safe. Its life is easy as\r\nlong as the host lives. But the disadvantages of parasitism and\r\ndegeneration are nevertheless obvious. The fate of the parasite is bound\r\nup with the fate of the host. \"When the enemy of the host crab prevails,\r\nthe _Sacculina_ goes down without a chance to struggle in its own\r\ndefence. But far more important than the disadvantage in such particular\r\nor individual cases is the fact that the parasite cannot adapt itself in\r\nany considerable degree to new conditions. It has become so modified, so\r\nspecialized to adapt itself to the very special conditions under which\r\nit now lives, it has gone so far in giving up organs and functions, that\r\nif present conditions change and new ones come to exist the parasite\r\ncannot adapt itself to them. The independent free-living animal holds\r\nitself, one may say, able and ready to adapt itself to any new\r\nconditions of life. The parasite has risked everything for the sake of a\r\nsure and easy life under the present existing conditions. Change of\r\nconditions means its extinction.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.--Young fur seals, _Callorhinus ursinus_, of\r\nthe Tolstoi rookery, St. Paul Island, Bering Sea, killed by a\r\nparasitic intestinal worm, _Uncinaria_ sp.

Examples are\r\n    easily found. Locusts, katydids, green caterpillars, lizards,\r\n    crouching rabbits, and brooding birds are readily observed instances\r\n    of general protective resemblance. For examples of variable\r\n    resemblance examine specimens of a single locust species taken from\r\n    different localities; the individuals of the various species of the\r\n    genus _Trimerotropis_ show much variation to harmonize with their\r\n    surroundings. Collect a number of larvæ (caterpillars) of one of the\r\n    swallow-tail butterflies (_Papilio_), and when ready to pupate put\r\n    them separately into pasteboard boxes lined inside with differently\r\n    colored paper. The chrysalids will show in their coloration the\r\n    influence of the different colors of the lining paper, their\r\n    immediate environment. As examples of special protective resemblance\r\n    observe inch- or span-worms (larvæ of Geometrid moths). The\r\n    walking-stick is not uncommon; many spiders that inhabit flower-cups\r\n    show striking protective color patterns; and the Graptas or\r\n    comma-butterflies which resemble dead leaves may be examined.\r\n\r\n    To illustrate warning colors, find, if possible, the larvæ\r\n    (caterpillars) of the common milkweed or monarch butterfly (_Anosia\r\n    plexippus_), and offer them to birds, at the same time offering\r\n    other caterpillars, and note the results. For terrifying or\r\n    threatening appearance find specimens of the large green tobacco-\r\n    or tomato-worm (larva of the five-spotted sphinx-moth,\r\n    _Phlegethontius carolina_), or other sphingid larvæ.\r\n\r\n    The butterflies illustrating the striking example of mimicry,\r\n    described on p. 432, can be found in most parts of the country.\r\n    Syrphid and other flies which mimic bees and wasps can readily be\r\n    found on flowers.\r\n\r\n    Each student should search for himself for examples of protective\r\n    resemblance.\r\n\r\n=Use of color.=--The prevalence of color and the oftentimes striking\r\nand intricate coloration patterns of animals demand some explanation.\r\nAs naturalists are accustomed to find the frequently bizarre and\r\nseemingly inexplicable shapes and general structure of animals readily\r\nexplained by the principle of adaptation, that is, special\r\nmodification of body-structure to fit special conditions of life, so\r\nthey look to use as the chief explanation of color and markings. Some\r\nuses are obvious; bright colors and striking patterns may serve to\r\nattract mates or to avail as recognition marks by which individuals of\r\na kind may readily recognize each other. The white color of arctic\r\nanimals probably serves to help keep them warm by preventing radiation\r\nof heat from the body; on the other hand dark color may also help to\r\nkeep animals warm by absorbing heat. \"But by far the most widespread\r\nuse of color is for another purpose, that of assisting the animal in\r\nescaping from its enemies or in capturing its prey.\"\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that the young and old, too, of many kinds of\r\nground-inhabiting animals, when startled by an enemy will not run, but\r\ncrouching close to the ground remain immovable, trusting to remain\r\nunperceived. But a blue or crimson rabbit, however still it might\r\nkeep, would be easily seen by its enemy and killed. Rabbits, however,\r\nwhich are good examples of animals having this habit of lying close,\r\nare neither blue nor green nor red, but are colored very much like the\r\nground on which they crouch. This harmonious coloration is as\r\nnecessary to the success of this habit as is the keeping still. A\r\ngrasshopper flying or leaping in the air is conspicuous; when it\r\nalights how inconspicuous it is! Unless one has followed it closely in\r\nits flight and has kept the eye fixed on it after alighting it is\r\nusually impossible to distinguish it from its surroundings. And this\r\nis greatly to the advantage of the grasshopper in its efforts to\r\nescape its enemies, that is, in its struggle for existence. On the\r\nother hand a green katydid would be very conspicuous in a dusty road.\r\nBut dusty roads are precisely where katydids do not rest. They alight\r\namong the green leaves of a tree or shrub. The animals that live in\r\ndeserts are almost all obscurely mottled with gray and brownish and\r\nsand-color so as to harmonize in color with their habitual\r\nenvironment. The arctic hares and foxes and grouse which live in\r\nregions of perpetual snow are pure white instead of red or brown or\r\ngray like their cousins of temperate and warm regions.\r\n\r\nThese cases of an animal's color and markings harmonizing with the\r\nusual environment are called instances of _protective resemblance_;\r\nthat is, they are resemblances for a purpose, that purpose being to\r\nrender the animal indistinguishable from its surroundings and thus to\r\naid it in escaping its enemies. Such protective resemblances are\r\nobviously of great value to animals, and, like other advantageous\r\nmodifications, have been produced by the action of natural selection.\r\nThose individuals of a species most conspicuous and hence most readily\r\nperceived by enemies are the first (under ordinary circumstances) to\r\nbe captured and eaten. The less conspicuous live and produce young\r\nlike themselves. Of these young the least conspicuous are again saved\r\nand so over and over again through thousands of generations until this\r\nnatural selecting of the protectively colored results in the\r\nproduction of the wonderfully specialized examples of resemblance to\r\nwhich attention is called in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n=General, variable, and special protective resemblance.=--In the\r\nbrooks most fishes are dark olive or greenish above and white below.\r\nTo the birds and other enemies which look down on them they are\r\ncolored like the bottom. To their fish-enemies which look up from\r\nbelow they are like the white light above them in color and their\r\nforms are not clearly seen. The green tree-frogs and tree-snakes which\r\nlive habitually among green foliage; the mottled gray and tawny\r\nlizards and birds and small mammals of the plains and deserts, and the\r\nwhite hares and foxes and owls and ptarmigan of the snowy arctic\r\nregions--all show a general protective resemblance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--The twig or walking-stick insect,\r\n_Diapheromera femorata_. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\nSometimes an animal changes color when its surroundings change.\r\nCertain hares and grouse of northern latitudes are white in winter\r\nwhen the snow covers all the ground, but in summer when much of the\r\nsnow melts, revealing the brown and gray rocks and withered leaves,\r\nthey put on a grayish and brownish coat of hair or feathers. A small\r\ninsect called the toad-bug (_Galgulus_) lives abundantly on the banks\r\nof a pond on the campus of Stanford University. The shores of this\r\npond are covered in some places with bits of bluish rock, in others\r\nwith bits of reddish rock, and in still others with sand. Specimens of\r\nthe toad-bug collected from the blue rocks are bluish or leaden in\r\ncolor, those from the red rocks are reddish, and those from the sand\r\nare sand-colored. Changes of color to suit the surroundings can be\r\nquickly made by some animals. The chameleons of the tropics change\r\nmomentarily from green to brown, blackish, or golden. There is a\r\nlittle fish (_Oligocottus snyderi_) common in the tide-pools of the\r\nBay of Monterey in California whose color changes quickly to harmonize\r\nwith the rocks it happens to rest above. Such changing coloration to\r\nsuit the surroundings may be called _variable protective resemblance_.\r\n\r\nVery striking are those cases of protective resemblance in which the\r\nanimal resembles in color and shape, sometimes in extraordinary\r\ndetail, some particular object or part of its usual environment. This\r\nmay be called _special protective resemblance_. The larvæ of the\r\nGeometrid moths called inch-worms or span-worms are twig-like in\r\nappearance, and have the habit, when disturbed, of standing out\r\nstiffly from the twig or branch on which they rest, so as to resemble\r\nin attitude as well as color and markings a short or broken twig. To\r\nincrease this simulation the body of the larva often has a few\r\nirregular spots or humps resembling the scars left by fallen leaves,\r\nand it also lacks the middle prop-legs of the body common to other\r\nlepidopterous larvæ, which would tend to destroy the illusion so\r\nsuccessfully carried out by it. The common twig-insect or\r\nwalking-stick (fig. 162) with its wingless, greatly elongate, brown or\r\ngreenish body and legs is when at rest quite indistinguishable from\r\nthe twigs on which it lies. Another excellent example of special\r\nprotective resemblance is furnished by the famous green-leaf insect\r\n(_Phyllium_) of the tropics, which has broad leaf-like wings and body\r\nof a bright green color with markings which imitate the leaf-veins,\r\nand small irregular yellowish spots which simulate decaying or stained\r\nor fungus-covered spots in the leaf. Most striking of all, however, is\r\nthe large dead-leaf butterfly _Kallima_ (fig. 163) of the East Indian\r\nregion. The upper sides of the wing are dark with purplish and\r\norange markings not at all resembling a dead leaf. But the butterflies\r\nwhen at rest hold their wings together over the back, so that only the\r\nunder sides of them are exposed. These are exactly the color of a dry\r\ndead leaf with markings mimicking midrib and oblique veins, and, most\r\nremarkable of all, what are apparently two holes like those made in\r\nleaves by insects, but in the butterfly imitated by two small circular\r\nspots free from scales and hence clear and transparent. When _Kallima_\r\nalights it holds the wings in such position that the combination of\r\nall four produces with remarkable fidelity the simulation of a dead\r\nleaf still attached to the twig by a short pedicel or leaf-stalk\r\n(imitated by a short \"tail\" on the hind wings). The head and legs of\r\nthe butterfly are concealed beneath the wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--The dead-leaf butterfly, _Kallima_ sp., a\r\nremarkable case of special protective resemblance. (From specimen.)]\r\n\r\n=Warning colors, terrifying appearances, and mimicry.=--While many\r\nanimals are so colored as to harmonize with their habitual or usual\r\nenvironment, others on the contrary are very brightly colored and marked\r\nin such bizarre and striking pattern as to be conspicuous. There is no\r\nattempt at concealment; it is obvious that conspicuousness is the object\r\nsought or at least produced by the coloration. Animals like these, we\r\nshall find, are in almost all cases specially protected by special\r\nweapons of defence such as stings or poison-fangs, or by the secretion\r\nof an acrid, ill-tasting fluid in the body. Many caterpillars have been\r\nfound, by observation in nature and by experiment, to be distasteful to\r\ninsectivorous birds. Now it is obvious that it would be advantageous to\r\nthese caterpillars to be readily recognized by birds. After a few trials\r\nthe bird learns by experience to let these distasteful larvæ alone;\r\ntheir conspicuous markings serve as _warning colors_. The\r\nblack-and-yellow-banded caterpillar of the common milkweed or monarch\r\nbutterfly (_Anosia plexippus_) is a good example of such protection by a\r\ncombination of distastefulness and warning coloration. The little\r\nlady-bird beetles are mostly distasteful to birds; they are brightly and\r\nconspicuously marked. Certain little Nicaraguan frogs have a bright\r\nlivery of red and blue, in strong contrast to the dull concealing colors\r\nof other frogs in their region. By offering these little blue and red\r\nfrogs to hens and ducks the naturalist Belt found that they are\r\ndistasteful to the birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.--The larva of the pen-marked sphinx-moth,\r\n_Sphinx chersis_, showing terrifying attitude. (After Comstock.)]\r\n\r\nCertain animals which are without special means of defence and are not\r\ndistasteful are yet so marked or shaped, and so behave as to present a\r\nthreatening or _terrifying appearance_. The large green caterpillars\r\nof the sphinx-moths, the tomato- and tobacco-worms, are familiar\r\nexamples, each larva having a sharp horn on the back of the next to\r\nlast body-segment (fig. 164). When disturbed the caterpillar assumes a\r\nthreatening attitude, and the horn seems to be an effective weapon of\r\ndefence. As a matter of fact it is not at all a weapon of defence,\r\nbeing weak, not provided with poison, and altogether harmless.\r\n\r\nBut it would plainly be to the advantage of a defenceless animal, one\r\nwithout poison-fangs or sting and without an ill-tasting substance in\r\nits body, to be so marked and shaped as to mimic some other specially\r\ndefended or inedible animal sufficiently to be mistaken for it and\r\nthus to escape attack. Such cases have been noted, especially among\r\ninsects. This kind of protective resemblance may be called _mimicry_.\r\nA most striking case is that presented by the familiar monarch and\r\nviceroy butterflies (fig. 165). The monarch (_Anosia plexippus_) is\r\nperhaps the most abundant and widespread butterfly of our country. It\r\nis a fact well known to entomologists that it is distasteful to birds\r\nand is let alone by them. It is conspicuous, being large and chiefly\r\nred-brown in color. The viceroy (_Basilarchia archippus_), also\r\nred-brown and patterned almost exactly like the monarch, is not, as\r\nits appearance would seem to indicate, a very near relation of the\r\nlatter, but on the contrary it belongs to a genus of butterflies all\r\nof which, except the viceroy and one other, are black and white in\r\ncolor and of different pattern from the monarch. The viceroy is not\r\ndistasteful to birds, but by its extraordinary simulation or mimicking\r\nof the monarch it is not distinguished from it and so is not molested.\r\nIn the tropics there have been discovered numerous examples of mimicry\r\namong insects. The members of two large families of butterflies\r\n(Danaidæ and Heliconidæ) are distasteful to birds and are mimicked by\r\nmembers of other butterfly families (especially the Pieridæ).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--The monarch butterfly, _Anosia plexippus_\r\n(above), distasteful to birds, and the viceroy, _Basilarchia\r\narchippus_ (below), which mimics it. (From specimens.)]\r\n\r\n=Alluring coloration.=--A few animals show what is called alluring\r\ncoloration; that is, they display a color pattern so arranged as to\r\nresemble or mimic a flower or other lure, and thus entice to them other\r\nanimals, their natural prey. Certain Brazilian fly-catching birds have a\r\nbrilliantly colored crest which can be displayed in the shape of a\r\nflower-cup. The insects attracted by the false flower furnish the bird\r\nwith food. In the tribe of fishes called the \"anglers\" or \"fishing\r\nfrogs,\" the front rays of the dorsal fin are prolonged in the shape of\r\nlong slender filaments, the foremost and longest of which has a\r\nflattened and divided extremity. The angler conceals itself in the mud\r\nor in the cavities of a coral reef, and waves the filament back and\r\nforth. Small fish are attracted by the lure, mistaking it for worms\r\nwrithing about. When they approach they are engulfed in the mouth of the\r\nangler, which in some species is of enormous size. One of these angler\r\nspecies is known to fishermen as the \"all-mouth.\"\r\n\r\nFor a fuller account of protective resemblances and mimicry see Jordan\r\nand Kellogg's \"Animal Life,\" pp. 201-223. For still more extended\r\naccounts see Poulton's \"Colours of Animals,\" and Beddard's \"Animal\r\nColoration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                      THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n    TECHNICAL NOTE.--The larger aspects or phenomena of the distribution\r\n    of animals over the earth on land and in sea cannot be studied\r\n    personally in the field by the student, but many local features of\r\n    distribution can be so observed and studied. The restriction of\r\n    certain kinds of animals to certain kinds of habitat, the presence\r\n    and character and effectiveness of barriers, some of the modes of\r\n    distribution, the presence and successful life of introduced foreign\r\n    species such as the black and brown rats, the English sparrow, the\r\n    German and Asiatic cockroaches, the gradual change of range or\r\n    distribution of certain kinds of animals through the influence of a\r\n    change in environment (caused by man in cutting off forests,\r\n    cultivating heretofore wild pastures, etc.) all offer favorable and\r\n    profitable opportunities for personal observation.\r\n\r\n    An excellent and feasible piece of field-work in distribution is\r\n    the making of a zoological survey of the locality in which the\r\n    school is situated. A map of the locality should be made on a\r\n    generous scale, which should include all prominent physical\r\n    features of the region, such as streams, ponds, hills, woodlands,\r\n    marshes, etc., and on this map should be indicated the places where\r\n    the various animals of the local fauna occur. Some of the animal\r\n    species will have a limited range, and the limits of this range\r\n    should be shown. This map and faunal list can be added to and\r\n    perfected by successive classes. For fuller discussions of the\r\n    geographical distribution of animals see Jordan and Kellogg's\r\n    \"Animal Life,\" Beddard's \"Zoogeography,\" Heilprin's \"The\r\n    Distribution of Animals,\" and Wallace's \"Geographical\r\n    Distribution.\"\r\n\r\n=Geographical distribution.=--It is a matter of common knowledge with\r\nall of us that there are no wild lions or camels or kangaroos or monkeys\r\nor ostriches or nightingales in North America. Ostriches are found only\r\nin Africa and South America, kangaroos only in Australia, lions only in\r\nAsia and Africa. On the other hand there are no opossums in Europe or\r\ngrizzly bears or rattlesnakes anywhere else in the world than in this\r\ncountry. That is, certain kinds of animals have a certain limited range\r\nof occurrence or distribution. It is obvious, too, that certain animals\r\nlive only on land, while others live only in water, and of these latter\r\nsome are restricted to the ocean, while others live only in fresh water.\r\nAll of the facts regarding the dispersion or diffusion of animals on\r\nland and in water make up the science of the _geographical distribution\r\nof animals_, or, as it is sometimes called, _zoogeography_. Under this\r\nsubject are included not only the facts of the present actual\r\ndistribution or occurrence of animals over the world, but the facts\r\nconcerning the reasons for this distribution, the modes of travel and\r\ndispersion, the character and influence of barriers to the spread, and\r\nthe results, in the adaptation of old forms and the production of new\r\nforms, of the phenomena of distribution.\r\n\r\nJust as maps are made to show graphically the facts of political\r\ngeography, which concerns the position and extent of the various\r\npowers and States which claim the allegiance of the people, and the\r\nfacts of physical geography, which concerns the physical character of\r\nthe earth's surface, so maps are made to show the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals. Because of the great numbers of animal\r\nspecies no one map can show the distribution of all species, but a\r\nseries of maps of the world or of a continent or of a State or county\r\nor more limited region could be made (and many such have been made)\r\nshowing the distribution of selected species. In a map of a limited\r\nlocality, say of a few square miles, the occurrence and distribution\r\nof most of the commoner and more familiar animals can be shown, and\r\neach high school should possess such a map (see technical note at\r\nbeginning of this chapter).\r\n\r\n=Laws of distribution.=--The laws governing the distribution of animals\r\nover the earth's surface have been recently[20] expressed in a simple\r\nstatement as follows: Every species of animal is found in every part of\r\nthe earth unless (_a_) its individuals have been unable to reach this\r\nregion on account of barriers of some sort; or (_b_) having reached it,\r\nthe species is unable to maintain itself, through lack of capacity for\r\nadaptation, through severity of competition with other forms, or through\r\ndestructive conditions of environment; or (_c_) having entered and\r\nmaintained itself it has become so altered in the process of adaptation\r\nas to become a species distinct from the original type.\r\n\r\n=Modes of migration and distribution.=--That animals should be\r\ncontinually trying to extend their range is obvious from what we know\r\nof their rapid increase by multiplication. In a region which can\r\nprovide food for but one thousand wolves, there is a production each\r\nyear of several times one thousand. These new wolves must struggle\r\namong themselves for food, or migrate, if possible, to new regions as\r\nyet not inhabited by wolves. The wolf's mode of migration or\r\ndistribution is walking or running, and so with other mammals except\r\nthe bats and aquatic forms. Birds and bats can fly, and can thus\r\nmigrate more swiftly, farther, and over barriers which would stop\r\nmammals. Most insects can fly. Worms can only crawl and very slowly at\r\nthat. Fishes can swim, but if they are in a landlocked sheet of water,\r\nthey cannot go beyond its confines. Marine animals can migrate from\r\nocean to ocean, and land animals from continent to continent unless\r\nchecked by barriers (see next paragraph).\r\n\r\nBut besides such voluntary and independent modes of distribution long\r\njourneyings may be made involuntarily, or by a passive migration as it\r\nmay be called. Parasites, for example, are carried by their hosts in\r\nall their travels; the tiny Tardigrada and Rotifera, which can be\r\ndesiccated and yet restored to active life by coming again into water,\r\nare carried in the dried mud on the feet of birds or other animals. On\r\nfloating objects in rivers or in ocean currents land-animals may be\r\ncarried long distances. Man, the greatest traveller of all, is\r\nresponsible for the widened distribution of many animals. Thus have\r\ncome to us in ships from Europe the black and brown rats, the English\r\nsparrow, the Hessian fly, the commonest cockroaches of our houses and\r\nmany other forms. And these animals have been carried involuntarily\r\nall over the United States in railway-cars and wagons.\r\n\r\n=Barriers to distribution.=--As is indicated in the paragraph on the\r\nmodes of migration, a considerable sheet of water is obviously a\r\nbarrier to the further travelling of a walking or crawling\r\nland-animal, although no barrier to a winged form. Similarly a strip\r\nof land is a barrier to a strictly aquatic animal as a fish. Or a high\r\nfall in the stream may serve as an insuperable barrier, making it\r\nimpossible for any fish below the fall to reach the upper part of the\r\nstream. Numerous cases of this kind are known in the Rocky Mountains\r\nand Sierra Nevada, where a stream may be well supplied with trout\r\nbelow a fall, and quite bare of these fish above the fall. In the\r\nYosemite Valley in California trout live in the Merced River below the\r\ngreat Vernal and Nevada falls, but above these falls the Merced\r\ncontains no trout. To fresh-water swimming animals salt water may be a\r\nbarrier; thus some kinds of fresh-water fishes are limited to one of\r\ntwo near-by streams although the mouths of these streams empty near\r\neach other into the ocean. The amphibious batrachians, at home in\r\nfresh water and on land, are killed by contact with sea-water.\r\nEarthworms also are killed by salt water. Thus the narrowest ocean\r\nstrait is as effective a barrier to these animals as a whole sea.\r\nHigh mountain ranges and broad deserts are barriers to many\r\nland-animals, partly because of the physical obstacles, partly because\r\nof the differences in temperature and in food-supply.\r\n\r\nTemperature and climate (as distinct from temperature) and the ocean are\r\nthe three great barriers when we consider the animal kingdom as a whole,\r\nand look for the causes which determine the chief zoogeographical\r\ndivisions of the earth's surface. Most of the tropical animals cannot\r\nendure frost, hence the isothermal line of frost is a line across which\r\nfew tropical animals venture. Most arctic animals are enfeebled by heat,\r\nand the isothermal line which marks off the region in which frost occurs\r\nthe year round is another great zoogeographical boundary. But while\r\nthese lines are limits for localized species, some animals, as birds,\r\nespecially, keep within a relatively uniform temperature by migrations\r\nacross these lines. It should be borne in mind that the gradual decrease\r\nin temperature met with in going north or south from the tropics is also\r\nmet in the ascent of high mountains. The summits of lofty peaks, even in\r\nthe tropics, are truly arctic in character; they are snow-covered, and\r\nthe animals and plants on them are truly arctic. Thus in the ascent of a\r\nsingle mountain a whole series of life-zones from tropical to arctic can\r\nbe traversed.\r\n\r\nClimate, as distinct from temperature, establishes limits of\r\ndistribution. The animals of Eastern North America accustomed to a humid\r\natmosphere cannot live in the dry plains and deserts of the West.\r\nClosely associated with climate is the nature of the plant-growth\r\ncovering the land; here are forests and luxuriant meadows, there are\r\nsparse tough grasses of the dry plateau. The limits of a special kind of\r\nplant-growth often are the limits of distribution of certain animals.\r\n\r\nThe third great barrier, the ocean, is perhaps the most obvious of all\r\nin its influence. It is only in rare cases that any land-animal can\r\nindependently cross a great ocean. Thus the land-animals of Australia\r\ndiffer from those of all other countries, and those of Africa and\r\nSouth America have developed almost independently of one another. The\r\nocean is, as already mentioned, also a barrier for fresh-water aquatic\r\nanimals, and even marine fishes which live normally in shallow waters\r\nalong the shore rarely venture across the great depths of mid-ocean.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles or barriers met with determine the limits of a species.\r\nEach species broadens its range as far as it can. It attempts\r\nunwittingly, through natural processes of increase, to overcome the\r\nobstacles of ocean or river, of mountain or plain, of woodland or\r\nprairie or desert, of cold or heat, of lack of food or abundance of\r\nenemies--whatever the barriers may be. The degree of hindrance offered\r\nby any barrier differs with the nature of the animal trying to pass\r\nit. That which forms an impassable obstacle to one species may be a\r\ngreat aid to the spread of another. \"The river which blocks the monkey\r\nor the cat is the highway of the fish and turtle. The waterfall which\r\nlimits the ascent of the trout is the chosen home of the ouzel.\"\r\n\r\n=Faunæ and zoogeographic areas.=--The term _fauna_ is applied to the\r\nanimals of any region considered collectively. Thus the fauna of\r\nIllinois includes the entire list of animals found naturally in that\r\nState. The fauna of a schoolyard comprises all the animals found\r\nliving naturally in the yard. The fauna of a pond includes all the\r\nanimal inhabitants of the pond. (_Flora_ is used similarly of all the\r\nplants in a given region.) The relation of one fauna to another\r\ndepends on the character and effectiveness of the barriers between,\r\nand the physical character of the two regions. Thus the fauna of\r\nIllinois differs but little from that of Indiana or Iowa, because\r\nthere are no barriers between the States, and they are alike\r\nphysically. On the other hand the fauna of California differs much\r\nfrom that of the Eastern States because of the great barriers (the\r\ndesert and the Sierra Nevada Mountains) which lie between it and these\r\nStates, and because of the great differences in the physical and\r\nclimatic conditions of the two regions.\r\n\r\nThe land-surface of the earth has been divided by zoogeographers into\r\nseven great realms of animal life, based on the distributional\r\ncharacters shown by these various regions. These realms are separated\r\nby barriers of which the chief are the presence of the sea and the\r\noccurrence of frost. These realms are named, from their geographical\r\nregion, the Arctic, the North Temperate, the South American, the\r\nIndo-African, the Madagascar, the Patagonian, and the Australian. Of\r\nthese the Australian alone is sharply defined. Most of the others are\r\nsurrounded by a broad fringe of debatable ground that forms a\r\ntransition to some other zone.\r\n\r\n=Habitat and species.=--The habitat of a species of animal is the\r\nregion in which it is found in a state of nature. It is currently\r\nbelieved that the habitat of any animal is the whole of that region\r\nfor which it is best adapted. But this is not necessarily true. In\r\nfact in most cases it is not true. The trout naturally debarred from\r\nthe rivers in Yellowstone Park by the waterfalls could live there well\r\nif the barrier could be passed. In the case of one stream it has been\r\npassed and the trout flourish above the fall. The success of the black\r\nand brown rats and the English sparrow in America, of the rabbit in\r\nAustralia, of bumblebees and house-flies in New Zealand, all of which\r\nanimals had a natural habitat not including these regions, but by\r\nartificial means have been carried over the barriers and into the new\r\nterritory, prove that \"habitat\" is not necessarily coincident with\r\n\"only fit region.\" Shad, striped bass, and catfish from the Potomac\r\nRiver have been introduced into and now thrive in the Sacramento River\r\nin California. In fact the whole work of the introduction and\r\ndiffusion of valuable food-animals in territory not naturally included\r\nin the habitat of the species is based on our knowledge that the\r\nhabitat of a species is often determined by physical barriers rather\r\nthan by exclusive fitness of environment. Within the natural habitat\r\nthe environment _is_ fit for the species' existence, outside of it the\r\nenvironment _may_ be fit.\r\n\r\nBut there occur numerous instances where a species successful in leaving\r\nits original habitat is unsuccessful in attempting to maintain itself on\r\nnew ground. Man has introduced various animals from one country to\r\nanother. The English sparrow (naturally debarred from this country by\r\nthe ocean barrier), brought to America from Europe, has covered its new\r\nterritory rapidly and maintains itself with brilliant success. But the\r\nnightingale, the starling and skylark which have been repeatedly\r\nintroduced and set free are unable to maintain themselves here.\r\n\r\n=Species-extinguishing and species-forming.=--Accompanying the\r\nconstant slow migrating of species into new habitats and the constant\r\nslow changing of environment and conditions everywhere is to be seen a\r\nconstant modification of the fauna of any region due to the inability\r\nof some species to maintain their ground, the predominating increase\r\nof others, and the modifying or adaptive changing of others into new\r\nforms. In 1544 the black rat of Europe was introduced into America and\r\nit soon crowded out the native rats, being in its turn crowded out by\r\nthe European brown rat (the present common rat in buildings),\r\nintroduced about 1775. Here we have the original native species unable\r\nto maintain itself in competition with introduced forms.\r\n\r\nWith a change of environing conditions, certain species are unable to\r\nmaintain themselves. With the destruction of the forests going on in\r\nparts of our country the great host of wood-creatures, the bears,\r\nsquirrels, the wood-birds and insects, can no longer maintain\r\nthemselves, and grow rare and disappear. Man often also influences the\r\nstatus of a species by checking its increase either by actual\r\nslaughter, as with the bison and passenger-pigeon, or by making\r\nadverse changes in its environment, as by destroying forests, or\r\nputting the plains under cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of \"species-forming\" (see p. 408) it was shown that\r\nadaptation may lead to the altering of species, and to the formation\r\nof new ones (under the influence of natural selection). With the\r\ngradual change of conditions, or with the facing of new conditions\r\nbecause of an unusual migration to or invasion of new territory, those\r\nindividuals of the species exposed to the new conditions must adapt\r\nthemselves in structure and habit in order to meet successfully the\r\nnew demands. By the cumulative action of natural selection these\r\nadaptive changes are emphasized; and this emphasis may come to be so\r\npronounced that the part of the species represented in this newly\r\nacquired territory, if isolated from the original stock, is so altered\r\nas to be quite distinct in appearance from the old. If these changed\r\nindividuals are also physiologically distinct from the old stock, i.e.\r\nare unable to mate with them, a new species is established. As already\r\nmentioned, the peopling of islands from mainlands is an excellent and\r\nreadily observable example of the phenomena referred to in the third\r\nlaw of distribution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[20] Jordan and Kellogg's \"Animal Life,\" 1900, p. 274.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDICES\r\n\r\n                         EQUIPMENT AND METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX I\r\n\r\n                     EQUIPMENT AND NOTES OF PUPILS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Equipment of pupils.=--Each pupil should have a laboratory note-book\r\nof about 8 × 10 inches, opening at the end, in which both drawings and\r\nnotes can be made. The paper should be unruled and of good quality\r\n(not too soft). Each pupil should have also instruments of his own as\r\nfollows: scalpel, pair of small scissors, spring forceps, pair of\r\ndissecting-needles, small glass pipette, and paper of ribbon-pins for\r\npinning out specimens. The cost of this outfit need not exceed $1.00.\r\nThe laboratory should furnish him with a dissecting-dish and a\r\ndissecting-microscope, or at least a lens.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory drawings and notes.=--Each pupil should make the drawings\r\ncalled for in the directions for the laboratory exercises. These\r\ndrawings should be in outline, and put in by pencil; the lines may be\r\ninked over if preferred. Shading should be used sparingly, if at all.\r\nEach drawing and all the organs and animal parts represented in it\r\nshould be fully named. See the anatomical plates in this book for\r\nexample. With such complete \"labelling,\" little note-taking need be\r\ndone in connection with the dissections.\r\n\r\nNotes should be made of any observations which cannot be represented\r\nin the drawings; for example, on the behavior of the living animals.\r\nAll notes referring to matters of life-history should be dated.\r\n\r\n=Field-observations and notes.=--Scattered through this book will be\r\nfound numerous suggestions for student field-work, for the observation\r\nof the life-history and habits and conditions of animals in nature. As\r\nexplained in the Preface, the initiation and direction of such work\r\nmust be left to the teacher. But its importance both because of its\r\ninstructiveness and its interest is great. Pupils should not only be\r\nincited to make individual observations whenever and wherever they\r\ncan, but the teacher should make little field-excursions with the\r\nclass or with parts of it at various times, to ponds or streams or\r\nwoods, and \"show things\" to all. The life-history and feeding-habits\r\nof insects, the web-making of spiders, the flight, songs, nesting, and\r\ncare of young of birds, the haunts of fishes, the development of\r\nfrogs, toads, and salamanders, the home-building and feeding-habits of\r\nsquirrels, mice, and other familiar mammals are all (as has been\r\ncalled attention to at proper places in the book) specially fit\r\nsubjects for field-observation.\r\n\r\nEach pupil should keep a field note-book, recording from day to day,\r\nunder exact date, any observations he may make. Let the most trivial\r\nthings be noted; when referred to later in connection with other notes\r\nthey may not seem so trivial. The field note-book should be smaller than\r\nthe laboratory note- and drawing-book, small enough to be carried in the\r\npocket. Notes should be made on the spot of observation; do not wait to\r\nget home. Sketches, even rough ones, may be advantageously put into the\r\nbook. Students with photographic cameras can do some very interesting\r\nand valuable field-work in making photographs of animals, their nests\r\nand favorite haunts. Such photographic work is very effectively used now\r\nin the illustration of books about animals and plants (see the\r\nreproductions of photographs in this book). If the class is making a\r\ncollection the collecting notes or data made in the field-books of the\r\ndifferent pupil collectors should all be transferred to a common \"Notes\r\non Collections\" book kept by the whole class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX II\r\n\r\n                    LABORATORY EQUIPMENT AND METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Equipment of laboratory.=--The equipment of the laboratory or\r\nclassroom will, of necessity, depend upon the opportunities afforded\r\nthe teacher by the school officers to provide such facilities as\r\ninstruments, books, and charts. If dissections are to be seriously and\r\nproperly made, however, some equipment is indispensable. Flat-topped\r\ntables, not over 30 inches high, a few compound microscopes (one is\r\nmuch better than none), as many simple lenses, or, far better, simple\r\ndissecting-microscopes, as there are students, dissecting-dishes, a\r\npair of bone-clippers, one injecting-syringe, a bunch of bristles,\r\nwater, a few simple reagents and some inexpensive glassware, as\r\nslides, cover-glasses, watch-crystals, and fruit- or battery-jars for\r\nlive cages and aquaria, make up a sufficient equipment for good work.\r\nMuch can be done with less, and perhaps a little more with some\r\nadditional facilities.\r\n\r\nThe dissecting-pans should be of galvanized iron or tin, oblong, about\r\n6 × 8 inches by 2 inches deep, with slightly flaring sides. If an iron\r\nwire be run around the margin, and the margin bent back over it, it\r\nwill strengthen the dish, and make a broader and smoother edge for the\r\nhands to rest on. Diagonally across the dish, about one-fourth inch\r\nfrom the bottom, should run a thick wire. A layer of paraffin one-half\r\ninch thick should cover the bottom. It should be poured in melted,\r\nwhen the diagonal wire will be imbedded in it and will hold it in\r\nplace. Acids must not be put into the pan.\r\n\r\nThe reagents necessary are alcohol of 95 per cent and 85 per cent, and\r\nformalin of 4 per cent (the formaldehyde sold by druggists is 40 per\r\ncent and should be diluted ten times with water), these for preserving\r\nmaterial for dissection; chloroform for killing specimens; glycerin for\r\nmaking temporary microscopic mounts, and 20 per cent nitric acid for\r\npreparing specimens for study of the nervous system. In addition there\r\nwill be needed the few other materials mentioned in the following\r\nparagraphs as necessary in the preparation of injecting-fluids, the\r\nstaining of fresh tissue and preserving by special methods.\r\n\r\nA list of reference books desirable in the laboratory is appended as a\r\nseparate paragraph (see p. 454).\r\n\r\n=Collecting and preparing material for use in the laboratory.=--As\r\ndirections have been given in the \"technical notes\" scattered through\r\nthe book for the collecting and preparing of all the various kinds of\r\nanimals chosen as subjects of the laboratory exercises, it will only be\r\nnecessary to give here directions for making certain special mixtures\r\nand for the special preparation of specimens by injection, etc.\r\nSpecimens to be used for dissection should be kept in alcohol of 85 per\r\ncent or in formalin of 4 per cent. Alcohol is better for the earthworm,\r\nbut for the other examples formalin is either better or as good, and as\r\nit is much cheaper it may well be chosen for the general preservative.\r\n\r\n_Methyl green_, a stain used for coloring fresh tissues. Dissolve the\r\nmethyl green powder in water, using about as much powder as the water\r\nwill take up. Add a few drops of acetic acid.\r\n\r\n_Injecting-masses._--Injections are best made with preparations of\r\nFrench gelatine, but white glue will answer most purposes. For fine\r\ninjection use a combination of the following: 1 part of a solution of\r\ngelatine, 1 part to 4 parts of water; 1 part of a saturated solution of\r\nlead acetate in water, and 1 part of a saturated solution of potassium\r\nbichromate in water. A mixture of these when hot gives a beautiful\r\nyellow injection-mass which, filtered, will pass through the finest\r\ncapillaries. For different colorings use dry paints, which come in\r\nultramarine blue, vermilion, and green. The gelatine should be\r\nthoroughly soaked before the coloring-matter is added. A mistake is\r\ngenerally made in using the injection-mass too thick. One part by weight\r\nof gelatine to six or even more parts of water is a good proportion. The\r\ngelatine as well as glue-masses should be made in a water-bath, which\r\nconsists of one dish placed within another outer one containing warm\r\nwater. The mass should be injected warm, _not hot_, after which the\r\ninjected specimen is to be placed in cold water until the injecting-mass\r\nhas set. Glue (the ordinary white kind) can be used for most injections\r\njust as the gelatine was used, but should not be so much diluted. All\r\ninjection-masses should be filtered through a cloth before using.\r\n\r\n_Preparing skeletons._--In general, skeletons are best cleaned by\r\nboiling. After most of the flesh has been cut away the skeleton should\r\nbe boiled in a soap solution until the remaining parts of the muscles\r\nare thoroughly softened. The soap solution is made of 2,000 c.c. of\r\nwater, preferably distilled, 12 grams of saltpetre, and 75 grams of\r\nhard soap (white). Heat these until dissolved, then add 150 c.c. of\r\nstrong ammonia. This stock solution is mixed with four or five parts\r\nof water, when the mixture is ready for use. The bones after boiling\r\nare rinsed in cold water, brushed and picked clean, then left to dry\r\non a clean surface.\r\n\r\n_Preserving anatomical preparations._--Many specimens worth keeping\r\nwill be found, and for them a solution known as Fischer's formula is\r\nsuggested as good, especially for brains. Fischer's formula is made up\r\nas follows: 2,000 c.c. of water, 50 c.c. of formalin, 100 grams of\r\nsodium chloride, and 15 grams of zinc chloride. These are mixed\r\ntogether until thoroughly dissolved. Open preparations well before\r\nplacing them in the liquid and use about twenty times the volume of\r\nthe object to be preserved.\r\n\r\n_To keep fresh dissections._--For materials which are dissected fresh\r\nand must be kept over for several days in a fresh condition add a few\r\ndrops of carbolic acid to the water which covers them. Carbolized\r\nwater (2 per cent in water) will preserve a great many tissues for a\r\nlong time. Hearts will remain for years in a supple condition in this\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n_Obtaining marine animals, microscopic preparations, etc._--For\r\nschools not on the seashore the marine animals such as starfishes,\r\netc., which are to be dissected or examined as examples of the\r\nbranches to which they belong must be obtained as preserved specimens\r\nfrom dealers in such supplies. Among such dealers on the Atlantic\r\ncoast are the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Holl, Mass.; F. W.\r\nWalmsley, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, Pa.; and H. H.\r\nand C. S. Brimley, Raleigh, N. C.; on the Pacific coast the Supply\r\nDepartment, Hopkins Seaside Laboratory, Stanford University,\r\nCalifornia. Ward's Natural Science Establishment, Rochester, N. Y.,\r\nsupplies almost any biological specimens asked for. This establishment\r\nfurnishes already made dissections and sets illustrating life-history\r\nand metamorphosis. The few permanent microscopic preparations which\r\nare mentioned in the book as desirable to have can be made by the\r\nteacher if he has had any training in microscopical technic. If not,\r\nthey may be bought cheaply of such dealers in natural history\r\nsupplies as the Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., Rochester, N. Y.; the\r\nKny-Scheerer Co., 17 Park Place, New York City; Queen & Co., 1010\r\nChestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa., and numerous others. From these\r\ndealers also can be bought all of the laboratory supplies, such as\r\nlenses, slides, cover-glasses, dissecting-scalpels, scissors and\r\nneedles, etc., mentioned in this book.\r\n\r\n_Reference books._--Throughout the preceding chapters exact references\r\nhave been made to various books, as many of which as possible should\r\nbe in the school-library. Some of these references have been made with\r\nspecial regard to the teacher, but most with special regard to the\r\npupil. All of the books referred to are included in the following\r\nlist. For the convenience of the prospective buyer, the names of the\r\npublishers and prices of the books are appended. In buying books, it\r\nis of course not necessary to order from the various publishers. A\r\nlist of the books desired may be handed to any book-dealer, who will\r\norder them and who should in most cases be able to get them for a\r\nlittle less than publisher's list prices.\r\n\r\n    =Baskett, J.

Harmless snakes are\r\neasily kept in glass-covered boxes; snails and slugs are contented\r\ndwellers indoors; certain fish live well in small aquaria, and many\r\nother familiar forms can be kept alive under observation for a longer\r\nor shorter time. But from the ease with which they are obtained and\r\ncared for, the inexpensiveness of their live-cages, and the\r\ninteresting character of their life-history and general habits,\r\ninsects are, of all animals, the ones which specially commend\r\nthemselves for the schoolroom menagerie. In the technical notes in the\r\nchapter (XXI) devoted to insects are numerous suggestions regarding\r\nthe obtaining and care of certain kinds of insects which may be reared\r\nand studied to advantage in the schoolroom. In the following\r\nparagraphs are given directions for making the necessary live-cages\r\nand aquaria for these insects.\r\n\r\n=Live-cages and aquaria.=--Prof. J. H. Comstock has so well described\r\nthe making of simple and inexpensive cages and aquaria in his book,\r\n\"Insect Life,\" that, with his permission, his account is quoted here.\r\n\r\n_Live-cages._--\"A good home-made cage can be built by fitting a pane of\r\nglass into one side of an empty soap-box. A board, three or four inches\r\nwide, should be fastened below the glass so as to admit of a layer of\r\nsoil being placed in the lower part of the cage, and the glass can be\r\nmade to slide, so as to serve as a door (fig. 166). The glass should fit\r\nclosely when shut, to prevent the escape of the insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--Soap-box breeding-cage for insects. (From\r\nJenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\n\"In rearing caterpillars and other leaf-eating larvæ, branches of the\r\nfood-plant should be stuck into bottles or cans which are filled with\r\nsand saturated with water. By keeping the sand wet the plants can be\r\nkept fresh longer than in water alone, and the danger of the larvæ\r\nbeing drowned is avoided by the use of sand.\r\n\r\n\"Many larvæ when full-grown enter the ground to pass the pupal state;\r\non this account a layer of loose soil should be kept in the bottom of\r\na breeding-cage. This soil should not be allowed to become dry,\r\nneither should it be soaked with water. If the soil is too dry the\r\npupæ will not mature, or if they do so the wings will not expand\r\nfully; if the soil is too damp the pupæ are liable to be drowned or to\r\nbe killed by mold.\r\n\r\n\"It is often necessary to keep pupæ over winter, for a large\r\nproportion of insects pass the winter in the pupal state. Hibernating\r\npupæ may be left in the breeding-cages or removed and packed in moss\r\nin small boxes. Great care should be taken to keep moist the soil in\r\nthe breeding-cages, or the moss if that be used. The cages or boxes\r\ncontaining the pupæ should be stored in a cool cellar, or in an\r\nunheated room, or in a large box placed out of doors where the sun\r\ncannot strike it. Low temperature is not so much to be feared as great\r\nand frequent changes of temperature.\r\n\r\n\"Hibernating pupæ can be kept in a warm room if care be taken to keep\r\nthem moist, but under such treatment the mature insects are apt to\r\nemerge in midwinter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--Lamp-chimney and flower-pot breeding-cage\r\nfor insects. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\n\"An excellent breeding-cage is represented by fig. 167. It is made by\r\ncombining a flower-pot and a lantern-globe. When practicable, the\r\nfood-plant of the insects to be bred is planted in the flower-pot; in\r\nother cases a bottle or tin can filled with wet sand is sunk into the\r\nsoil in the flower-pot, and the stems of the plant are stuck into this\r\nwet sand. The top of the lantern-globe is covered with Swiss muslin.\r\nThese breeding-cages are inexpensive, and especially so when the pots\r\nand globes are bought in considerable quantities. A modification of\r\nthis style of breeding-cage that is used by the writer differs only in\r\nthat large glass cylinders take the place of the lantern-globes. These\r\ncylinders were made especially for us by a manufacturer of glass, and\r\ncost from six to eight dollars per dozen, according to size, when made\r\nin lots of fifty.\r\n\r\n\"When the transformation of small insects or of a small number of\r\nlarger ones are to be studied, a convenient cage can be made by\r\ncombining a large lamp-chimney with a small flower-pot.\r\n\r\n\"_The root-cage._--For the study of insects that infest the roots of\r\nplants, the writer has devised a special form of breeding-cage known as\r\nthe root-cage. In its simplest form this cage consists of a frame\r\nholding two plates of glass in a vertical position and only a short\r\ndistance apart. The space between the plates of glass is filled with\r\nsoil in which seeds are planted or small plants set. The width of the\r\nspace between the plates of glass depends on the width of two strips of\r\nwood placed between them, one at each end, and should be only wide\r\nenough to allow the insects under observation to move freely through the\r\nsoil. If it is too wide the insects will be able to conceal themselves.\r\nImmediately outside of each glass there is a piece of blackened zinc\r\nwhich slips into grooves in the ends of the cage, and which can be\r\neasily removed when it is desired to observe the insects in the soil.\r\n\r\n\"_Aquaria._--For the breeding of aquatic insects aquaria are needed.\r\nAs the ordinary rectangular aquaria are expensive and are liable to\r\nleak we use glass vessels instead.\r\n\r\n\"Small aquaria can be made of jelly-tumblers, glass finger-bowls, and\r\nglass fruit-cans, and larger aquaria can be obtained of dealers. A\r\ngood substitute for these is what is known as a battery-jar (fig.\r\n168). There are several sizes of these, which can be obtained of most\r\ndealers in scientific apparatus.\r\n\r\n\"To prepare an aquarium, place in the jar a layer of sand; plant some\r\nwater-plants in this sand, cover the sand with a layer of gravel or\r\nsmall stones, and then add the required amount of water carefully, so\r\nas not to disturb the plants or to roil the water unduly. The growing\r\nplants will keep the water in good condition for aquatic animal life,\r\nand render changing of the water unnecessary, if the animals in it\r\nlive naturally in quiet water. Among the more available plants for use\r\nin aquaria are the following:\r\n\r\n\"Waterweed, _Elodea canadensis_.\r\n\r\n\"Bladderwort, _Utricularia_ (several species).\r\n\r\n\"Water-starwort, _Callitriche_ (several species).\r\n\r\n\"Watercress, _Nasturtium officinale_.\r\n\r\n\"Stoneworts, _Chara and Nitella_ (several species of each).\r\n\r\n\"Frog-spittle or water-silk, _Spirogyra_.\r\n\r\n\"A small quantity of duckweed, _Lemna_, placed on the surface of the\r\nwater adds to the beauty of an aquarium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--Battery-jar aquarium. (From Jenkins and\r\nKellogg.)]\r\n\r\n\"When it is necessary to add water to an aquarium on account of loss\r\nby evaporation, rain water should be used to prevent an undue\r\naccumulation of the mineral-water held in solution in other water.\"\r\n\r\n=Making collections.=--Much is to be learned about animals by\r\n\"collecting\" them. But the collecting should be done chiefly with the\r\nidea of learning about the animals rather than with the notion of\r\ngetting as many specimens as possible. To collect, it is necessary to\r\nfind the animals alive; one learns thus their haunts, their local\r\ndistribution, and something of their habits, while by continued work\r\none comes to know how many and what different kinds or species of each\r\ngroup being collected occur in the region collected over. Collecting\r\nrequires the sacrifice of life, however, and this will always be kept\r\nwell in mind by the humane teacher and pupil. Where one set of\r\nspecimens will do, no more should be collected. The author believes\r\nthat high-school work in this line should be almost exclusively\r\nlimited to the building up of a common school collection. Let a single\r\nset of specimens be brought together by the combined efforts of all\r\nthe members of the class, and let it be well housed and cared for\r\npermanently. Each succeeding class will add to it; it may come in time\r\nto be a really representative exhibition of the local fauna.\r\n\r\nThe high-school collection should include not only adult specimens of\r\nthe various kinds of animals, forming a systematic collection, as it\r\nis called, but also all kinds of specimens which illustrate the\r\nstructure and habits of the animals in question and which will\r\nconstitute a so-called biological collection. Specimens of the eggs\r\nand all immature stages; dissections preserved in alcohol or formalin\r\nshowing the external and internal anatomy; nests, cocoons, and all\r\nspecimens showing the work and industries of the various animals; in\r\nshort, any specimen of the animal itself in embryonic or postembryonic\r\ncondition, or any parts of the animal, or anything illustrating what\r\nthe animal does or how it lives, all these should be collected as\r\nassiduously as the adult individuals. Each specimen in the collection\r\nshould be labelled with the name of the animal, the date, and\r\nlocality, and the name of the collector, with any particular\r\ninformation which will make it more instructive. If such special data\r\nare too voluminous for a label, they should be written in a general\r\nnote-book called \"Notes on Collections\" (kept in the schoolroom with\r\nthe collection), the specimen and corresponding data being given a\r\ncommon number so that their association may be recognized. In the\r\nfollowing paragraphs are given brief directions for catching, pinning\r\nup, and caring for insects, for making skins of birds and mammals, and\r\nfor the alcoholic preservation of other kinds of animals.\r\n\r\n_Insects._--For catching insects there are needed a net, a\r\nkilling-bottle, a few small vials of alcohol, and a few small boxes to\r\ncarry home live specimens, cocoons, galls, etc. For preparing and\r\npreserving the insects there are needed insect-pins, cork- or pith-lined\r\ndrawers or boxes, and small wide-mouthed bottles of alcohol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--Insect killing-bottle; cyanide of potassium\r\nat bottom, covered with plaster of Paris. (From Jenkins and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nThe net, about 2 feet deep, tapering and rounded at its lower end, is\r\nmade of cheesecloth or bobinet (not mosquito-netting, which is too\r\nfrail), attached to a ring, one foot in diameter, of No. 3 galvanized\r\niron wire, which in turn is fitted into a light wooden or cane handle\r\nabout three and a half feet long.\r\n\r\nThe killing-bottle (fig. 169) is prepared by putting a few small lumps\r\n(about a teaspoonful) of cyanide of potassium into the bottom of a\r\nwide-mouthed bottle holding about four ounces, and covering this\r\ncyanide with wet plaster of Paris. When the plaster sets it will hold\r\nthe cyanide in place, and allow the fumes given off by its gradual\r\nvolatilization to fill the bottle. Insects dropped into it will be\r\nkilled in from two or three to ten minutes. Keep a little tissue paper\r\nin the bottle to soak up moisture and to prevent the specimens from\r\nrubbing. Also keep the bottle well corked. Label it \"Poison,\" and do\r\nnot breathe the fumes (hydrocyanic gas). Insects may be left in it\r\nover night without injury to them.\r\n\r\nButterflies or dragon-flies too large to drop into the killing-bottle\r\nmay be killed by dropping a little chloroform or benzine on a piece of\r\ncotton, to be placed in a tight box with them. Larvæ (caterpillars,\r\ngrubs, etc.) and pupæ (chrysalids) should be dropped into the vials of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nIn collecting, visit flowers, sweep the net back and forth over the\r\nsmall flowers and grasses of meadows and pastures, look under stones,\r\nbreak up old logs and stumps, poke about decaying matter, jar and\r\nshake small trees and shrubs, and visit ponds and streams. Many\r\ninsects can be collected in summer at night about electric lights, or\r\na lamp by an open window.\r\n\r\nWhen the insects are brought home or to the schoolroom they must be\r\n\"pinned up.\" Buy insect-pins, long, slender, small-headed, sharp-pointed\r\npins, of a dealer in naturalists' supplies (see p. 453). These pins cost\r\nten cents a hundred. Order Klaeger pins, No. 3, or Carlsbaeder pins, No.\r\n5. These are the most useful sizes. For larger pins order Klaeger No. 5\r\n(Carlsbaeder No. 8); for smaller order Klaeger No. 1 (Carlsbaeder No.\r\n2). Pin each insect straight down through the thorax (fig. 170) (except\r\nbeetles, which pin through the right wing-cover near the middle of the\r\nbody). On each pin below the insect place a small label with date and\r\nlocality of capture. Insects too small to be pinned may be gummed on to\r\nsmall slips of cardboard, which should be then pinned up. Keep the\r\ninsects in drawers or boxes lined on the bottom with a thin layer of\r\ncork, or pith of some kind. (Corn-pith can be used; also in the West,\r\nthe pith of the flowering stalk of the century plant.) The cheapest\r\ninsect-boxes and very good ones, too, are cigar-boxes. But unless well\r\nlooked after they let in tiny live insects which feed on the dead\r\nspecimens. For a permanent collection, therefore, it will be necessary\r\nto have made some tight boxes or drawers. Glass-topped ones are best, so\r\nthat the specimens may be examined without opening them. A \"moth-ball\"\r\n(naphthaline) fastened in one corner of the box will help keep out the\r\nmarauding insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.--Insect properly \"pinned up.\" (From Jenkins\r\nand Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nButterflies, dragon-flies, and other larger and beautiful-winged\r\ninsects should be \"spread,\" that is, should be allowed to dry with\r\nwings expanded. To do this spreading- or setting-boards (figs. 171 and\r\n172) are necessary. Such a board consists of two strips of wood\r\nfastened a short distance apart so as to leave between them a groove\r\nfor the body of the insect, and upon which the wings are held in\r\nposition until the insect is dry. A narrow strip of pith or cork\r\nshould be fastened to the lower side of the two strips of wood,\r\nclosing the groove below. Into this cork is thrust the pin on which\r\nthe insect is mounted. Another strip of wood is fastened to the lower\r\nsides of the cleats to which the two strips are nailed. This serves as\r\na bottom and protects the points of the pins which project through the\r\npiece of cork. The wings are held down, after having been outspread\r\nwith the hinder margins of the fore wings about at right angles to the\r\nbody, by strips of paper pinned down over them.\r\n\r\n\"Soft specimens\" such as insect larvæ, myriapods, and spiders should\r\nbe preserved in bottles of alcohol (85 per cent). Nests, galls, stems,\r\nand leaves partly eaten by insects, and other dry specimens can be\r\nkept in small pasteboard boxes.\r\n\r\nFor a good and full account of insect-collecting and preserving, with\r\ndirections for making insect-cases, etc., see Comstock's \"Insect\r\nLife,\" pp. 284-314.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.--Setting-board with butterflies properly\r\n\"spread.\" (After Comstock.)]\r\n\r\n_Birds._--In collecting birds, shooting is chiefly to be relied on. Use\r\ndust-shot (the smallest shot made) in small loads. For shooting small\r\nbirds it is extremely desirable to have an auxiliary barrel of much\r\nsmaller bore than the usual shotgun which can be fitted into one of the\r\nregular gun-barrels. In such an auxiliary barrel use 32-calibre shells\r\nloaded with dust-shot instead of bullets. Plug up the throat and vent of\r\nshot birds with cotton, and thrust each bird head downward into a\r\ncornucopia of paper. This will keep the feathers unsoiled and smooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.--Setting-board in cross-section to show\r\nconstruction. (After Comstock.)]\r\n\r\nBirds should be skinned soon after bringing home, after they have become\r\nrelaxed, but before evidences of decomposition are manifest. The tools\r\nand materials necessary to make skins are scalpel, strong sharp-pointed\r\nscissors, bone-cutters, forceps, corn-meal, a mixture of two parts white\r\narsenic and one part powdered alum, cotton, and metric-system measure.\r\nBefore skinning, the bird should be measured. With a metric-system\r\nmeasure carefully take the alar extent, i.e. spread from tip to tip of\r\noutstretched wings; length of wing, i.e. length from wrist-joint to tip;\r\nlength of bill in straight line from base (on dorsal aspect) to tip;\r\nlength of tarsus, and length of middle toe and claw.\r\n\r\nTo skin the bird, cut from anus to point of breast-bone through the skin\r\nonly. Work skin away on each side to legs; push each leg up, cut off at\r\nknee-joint, skin down to next joint, remove all flesh from bone, and\r\npull leg back into place; loosen skin at base of tail, cut through\r\nvertebral column at last joint, being careful not to cut through bases\r\nof tail-feathers; work skin forward, turning it inside out, loosening it\r\ncarefully all around, without stretching, to wings; cut off wings at\r\nelbow-joint, skin down to next joint and remove flesh from wing-bones;\r\npush skin forward to base of skull, and if skull is not too large (it is\r\nin ducks, woodpeckers, and some other birds), on over it to ears and\r\neyes; be very careful in loosening the membrane of ears and in cutting\r\nnictitating membrane of eyes; do not cut into eyeball; remove eyeballs\r\nwithout breaking; cut off base of skull, and scoop out brain; remove\r\nflesh from skull, and \"poison\" the skin by dusting it thoroughly with\r\nthe powdered arsenic and alum mixture. Turn skin right side out, and\r\nclean off fresh blood-stains by soaking them up with corn-meal; wash off\r\ndried blood with water, and dry with corn-meal. Corn-meal may be used\r\nduring skinning to soak up blood and grease.\r\n\r\nThere remains to stuff the skin. Fill orbits of eyes with cotton (this\r\ncan be advantageously done before skin is reversed); thrust into neck a\r\nmoderately compact, elastic, smooth roll of cotton about thickness of\r\nthe natural neck; make a loose oval ball of size and general shape of\r\nbird's body and put into body-cavity with anterior end under the\r\nposterior end of neck-roll; pull two edges of abdominal incision\r\ntogether over the cotton, fasten, if necessary, with a single stitch of\r\nthread, smooth feathers, fold wings in natural position, wrap skin, not\r\ntightly, in thin sheet of cotton (opportunity for delicate handling\r\nhere) and put away in a drawer or box to dry. Before putting away tie\r\nlabel to leg, giving date and locality of capture, sex and measurements\r\nof bird, and name of collector. Before bird is put into permanent\r\ncollection it should be labelled with its common and scientific name.\r\n\r\nThe mounting of birds in lifelike shape and attitude is hard to do\r\nsuccessfully; and a collection of mounted birds demands much more\r\nroom and more expensive cabinets than one of skins. For instructions\r\nfor the mounting of birds see Davie's \"Methods in the Art of\r\nTaxidermy,\" pp. 39-57; or Hornaday's \"Taxidermy and Zoological\r\nCollecting.\" For a more detailed account of making bird-skins, see\r\nalso these books, or Ridgway's \"Directions for Collecting Birds.\"\r\n\r\nIn collecting birds' nests cut off the branch or branches on which the\r\nnest is placed a few inches above and below the nest, leaving it in\r\nits natural position. Ground-nests should have the section of the sod\r\non which they are placed taken up and preserved with them. If the\r\ninner lining of the nest consists of feathers or fur put in a\r\n\"moth-ball\" (naphthaline).\r\n\r\nTo preserve birds' eggs they should be emptied through a single small\r\nhole on one side by blowing. Prick a hole with a needle and enlarge with\r\nan egg-drill (obtain of dealers in naturalists' supplies, see p. 453.)\r\nBlow with a simple bent blowpipe with point smaller than the hole. After\r\nremoving contents clean by blowing in a little water, and blowing it out\r\nagain. After cleaning, place the egg, hole downward, on a layer of\r\ncorn-meal to dry. Label each egg by writing on it near the hole a\r\nnumber. Use a soft pencil for writing. This number should refer to a\r\nrecord (book) under similar number, or to an \"egg-blank,\" containing the\r\nfollowing data: name of bird, number of eggs in set, date and locality,\r\nname of collector, and any special information about the eggs or nest\r\nwhich the collector may think advisable. The eggs may be kept in drawers\r\nor boxes lined with cotton, and divided into little compartments.\r\n\r\nFor detailed directions for collecting and preserving birds' eggs and\r\nnests, see Bendire's \"Directions for Collecting, Preparing, and\r\nPreserving Birds' Eggs and Nests\" or Davie's \"Methods in the Art of\r\nTaxidermy,\" pp. 74-78. [21] _Mammals._--Any mammal intended for a\r\nscientific specimen should be measured in the flesh, before skinning,\r\nand as soon after death as practicable, when the muscles are still\r\nflexible. (This is particularly true of larger species, such as foxes,\r\nwildcats, etc.) The measurements are taken in millimetres, a rule or\r\nsteel tape being used. (1) Total length: stretch the animal on its\r\nback along the rule or tape and measure from the tip of the nose (head\r\nextended as far as possible) to the tip of the fleshy part of tail\r\n(not to end of hairs). (2) Tail: bend tail at right angles from body\r\nbackward and place end of ruler in the angle, holding the tail taut\r\nagainst the ruler. Measure only to tip of flesh (make this measurement\r\nwith a pair of dividers). (3) Hind foot: place sole of foot flat on\r\nruler and measure from heel to tip of longest toe-nail (in certain\r\nsmall mammals it is necessary to use dividers for accuracy). The\r\nmeasurements should be entered on the label, along with such necessary\r\ndata as sex, locality, date, and collector's name.\r\n\r\nSkin a mammal as soon after death as possible. Lay mammal on back and\r\nwith scissors or scalpel open the skin along belly from about midway\r\nbetween fore and hind legs to vent, taking care not to cut muscles of\r\nabdomen. Skin down on either side of the body by working the skin from\r\nflesh with fingers till hind legs appear. Use corn-meal to stanch\r\nblood or moisture. With left hand grasp a leg and work the knee from\r\nwithout into the opening just made; cut the bone at the knee, skin leg\r\nto heel and clean meat off the bone (leaving it attached of course to\r\nfoot). In animals larger than squirrels skin down to tips of toes. Do\r\nthe same with other leg. Skin around base of tail till the skin is\r\nfree all around so that a grip can be secured on body; then with thumb\r\nand forefinger hold the skin tight at base of tail and slowly pull out\r\nthe tail. In small mammals this can be done readily, but in foxes it\r\nis often necessary to split the skin up along the under side and\r\ndissect it off the tail-bones. After the tail is free skin down the\r\nbody, using the fingers (except in large mammals) till the fore legs\r\nare reached; treat the fore legs in the same manner as hind legs,\r\nthrusting elbow out of the skin much as a person would do in taking\r\noff a coat; cut bone at elbow; clean fore-arm bone. Skin over neck to\r\nbase of ears. With scalpel cut through ears close to skull. With\r\nscalpel dissect off skin over the head (taking care not to injure\r\neyelids) down to tip of nose, severing its cartilage and hence freeing\r\nskin from body. Sew mouth by passing needle through under lip and then\r\nacross through two sides of the upper lip; draw taut and tie thread.\r\nPoison skin thoroughly. Turn skin right side out. Next sever the skull\r\ncarefully from body, just where the last neck-vertebra joins the back\r\nof the skull. It is necessary to keep the skull, because characters of\r\nbone and teeth are much used in classification. Remove superfluous\r\nmeat from the skull and take out brain with a little spoon made of a\r\npiece of wire with loop at end. Tag the skull with a number\r\ncorresponding to that on skin, and hang up to dry. A finished specimen\r\nskull is made by boiling it a short time and picking the meat off with\r\nforceps, further cleaning it with an old tooth-brush, when it is\r\nplaced in the sun to bleach. Care must be taken always not to injure\r\nbones or dislodge teeth.\r\n\r\nMammals are stuffed with cotton or tow; the latter is used in species\r\nfrom a gray squirrel up. Large mammals stuffed with cotton do not dry\r\nreadily, and often spoil. Being much thicker-skinned than birds,\r\nmammals require more care in drying and ordinarily require a much\r\nlonger period. Soft hay may be substituted for tow; never use feathers\r\nor hair. Roll a longish wad of cotton about the size of body and\r\ninsert with forceps, taking care to form the head nearly as in life.\r\nSplit the back end of the cotton and stuff each hind leg with the two\r\nbranches thus formed. Roll a piece of cotton around end of forceps and\r\nstuff fore legs. Place a stout straight piece of wire in the tail,\r\nwrapping it slightly to give the tail the plump appearance of life.\r\n(If the cotton cannot be reeled on to the wire evenly, leave it off\r\nentirely.) Make the wire long enough to extend half way up belly. Sew\r\nup slit in belly. Lay mammal on belly and pin out on a board by legs,\r\nwith the fore legs close beside head, and hind legs parallel behind,\r\nsoles downward. Be sure the label is tied securely on right hind leg.\r\n\r\nFor directions for preparing and mounting skeletons of birds, mammals,\r\nand other vertebrates, see the books of Davie and Hornaday already\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n_Fishes, batrachians, reptiles, and other animals._--The most\r\nconvenient and usual way of preserving the other vertebrates (not\r\nbirds or mammals) is to put the whole body into 85 per cent alcohol or\r\n4 per cent formalin. Batrachians should be kept in alcohol not\r\nexceeding 60 per cent strength. Several incisions should always be\r\nmade in the body, at least one of which should penetrate the abdominal\r\ncavity. Anatomical preparations are similarly preserved. By keeping\r\nthe specimens in glass jars they may be examined without removal.\r\nFishes should not be kept in formalin more than a few months, as they\r\nabsorb water, swell, and grow fragile.\r\n\r\nOf the invertebrates all, except the insects, are preserved in alcohol\r\nor formalin. The shells of molluscs can be preserved dry, of course,\r\nin drawers or boxes divided into small compartments.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[21] The following directions for making skins of mammals were written\r\nfor this book by Mr. W.
