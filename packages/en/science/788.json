The abrupt liberation of sound!  As he timed it with his\r\nwatch, Bassett likened it to the trump of an archangel.  Walls of cities,\r\nhe meditated, might well fall down before so vast and compelling a\r\nsummons.  For the thousandth time vainly he tried to analyse the\r\ntone-quality of that enormous peal that dominated the land far into the\r\nstrong-holds of the surrounding tribes.  The mountain gorge which was its\r\nsource rang to the rising tide of it until it brimmed over and flooded\r\nearth and sky and air.  With the wantonness of a sick man’s fancy, he\r\nlikened it to the mighty cry of some Titan of the Elder World vexed with\r\nmisery or wrath.  Higher and higher it arose, challenging and demanding\r\nin such profounds of volume that it seemed intended for ears beyond the\r\nnarrow confines of the solar system.  There was in it, too, the clamour\r\nof protest in that there were no ears to hear and comprehend its\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\n—Such the sick man’s fancy.  Still he strove to analyse the sound.\r\nSonorous as thunder was it, mellow as a golden bell, thin and sweet as a\r\nthrummed taut cord of silver—no; it was none of these, nor a blend of\r\nthese.  There were no words nor semblances in his vocabulary and\r\nexperience with which to describe the totality of that sound.\r\n\r\nTime passed.  Minutes merged into quarters of hours, and quarters of\r\nhours into half-hours, and still the sound persisted, ever changing from\r\nits initial vocal impulse yet never receiving fresh impulse—fading,\r\ndimming, dying as enormously as it had sprung into being.  It became a\r\nconfusion of troubled mutterings and babblings and colossal whisperings.\r\nSlowly it withdrew, sob by sob, into whatever great bosom had birthed it,\r\nuntil it whimpered deadly whispers of wrath and as equally seductive\r\nwhispers of delight, striving still to be heard, to convey some cosmic\r\nsecret, some understanding of infinite import and value.  It dwindled to\r\na ghost of sound that had lost its menace and promise, and became a thing\r\nthat pulsed on in the sick man’s consciousness for minutes after it had\r\nceased.  When he could hear it no longer, Bassett glanced at his watch.\r\nAn hour had elapsed ere that archangel’s trump had subsided into tonal\r\nnothingness.\r\n\r\nWas this, then, _his_ dark tower?—Bassett pondered, remembering his\r\nBrowning and gazing at his skeleton-like and fever-wasted hands.  And the\r\nfancy made him smile—of Childe Roland bearing a slug-horn to his lips\r\nwith an arm as feeble as his was.  Was it months, or years, he asked\r\nhimself, since he first heard that mysterious call on the beach at\r\nRingmanu?  To save himself he could not tell.  The long sickness had been\r\nmost long.  In conscious count of time he knew of months, many of them;\r\nbut he had no way of estimating the long intervals of delirium and\r\nstupor.  And how fared Captain Bateman of the blackbirder _Nari_? he\r\nwondered; and had Captain Bateman’s drunken mate died of delirium tremens\r\nyet?\r\n\r\nFrom which vain speculations, Bassett turned idly to review all that had\r\noccurred since that day on the beach of Ringmanu when he first heard the\r\nsound and plunged into the jungle after it.  Sagawa had protested.  He\r\ncould see him yet, his queer little monkeyish face eloquent with fear,\r\nhis back burdened with specimen cases, in his hands Bassett’s butterfly\r\nnet and naturalist’s shot-gun, as he quavered, in Bêche-de-mer English:\r\n“Me fella too much fright along bush.  Bad fella boy, too much stop’m\r\nalong bush.”\r\n\r\nBassett smiled sadly at the recollection.  The little New Hanover boy had\r\nbeen frightened, but had proved faithful, following him without hesitancy\r\ninto the bush in the quest after the source of the wonderful sound.  No\r\nfire-hollowed tree-trunk, that, throbbing war through the jungle depths,\r\nhad been Bassett’s conclusion.  Erroneous had been his next conclusion,\r\nnamely, that the source or cause could not be more distant than an hour’s\r\nwalk, and that he would easily be back by mid-afternoon to be picked up\r\nby the _Nari’s_ whale-boat.\r\n\r\n“That big fella noise no good, all the same devil-devil,” Sagawa had\r\nadjudged.  And Sagawa had been right.  Had he not had his head hacked off\r\nwithin the day?  Bassett shuddered.  Without doubt Sagawa had been eaten\r\nas well by the “bad fella boys too much” that stopped along the bush.  He\r\ncould see him, as he had last seen him, stripped of the shot-gun and all\r\nthe naturalist’s gear of his master, lying on the narrow trail where he\r\nhad been decapitated barely the moment before.  Yes, within a minute the\r\nthing had happened.  Within a minute, looking back, Bassett had seen him\r\ntrudging patiently along under his burdens.  Then Bassett’s own trouble\r\nhad come upon him.  He looked at the cruelly healed stumps of the first\r\nand second fingers of his left hand, then rubbed them softly into the\r\nindentation in the back of his skull.  Quick as had been the flash of the\r\nlong handled tomahawk, he had been quick enough to duck away his head and\r\npartially to deflect the stroke with his up-flung hand.  Two fingers and\r\na hasty scalp-wound had been the price he paid for his life.  With one\r\nbarrel of his ten-gauge shot-gun he had blown the life out of the bushman\r\nwho had so nearly got him; with the other barrel he had peppered the\r\nbushmen bending over Sagawa, and had the pleasure of knowing that the\r\nmajor portion of the charge had gone into the one who leaped away with\r\nSagawa’s head.  Everything had occurred in a flash.  Only himself, the\r\nslain bushman, and what remained of Sagawa, were in the narrow, wild-pig\r\nrun of a path.  From the dark jungle on either side came no rustle of\r\nmovement or sound of life.  And he had suffered distinct and dreadful\r\nshock.  For the first time in his life he had killed a human being, and\r\nhe knew nausea as he contemplated the mess of his handiwork.\r\n\r\nThen had begun the chase.  He retreated up the pig-run before his\r\nhunters, who were between him and the beach.  How many there were, he\r\ncould not guess.  There might have been one, or a hundred, for aught he\r\nsaw of them.  That some of them took to the trees and travelled along\r\nthrough the jungle roof he was certain; but at the most he never glimpsed\r\nmore than an occasional flitting of shadows.   No bow-strings twanged\r\nthat he could hear; but every little while, whence discharged he knew\r\nnot, tiny arrows whispered past him or struck tree-boles and fluttered to\r\nthe ground beside him.  They were bone-tipped and feather shafted, and\r\nthe feathers, torn from the breasts of humming-birds, iridesced like\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nOnce—and now, after the long lapse of time, he chuckled gleefully at the\r\nrecollection—he had detected a shadow above him that came to instant rest\r\nas he turned his gaze upward.  He could make out nothing, but, deciding\r\nto chance it, had fired at it a heavy charge of number five shot.\r\nSqualling like an infuriated cat, the shadow crashed down through\r\ntree-ferns and orchids and thudded upon the earth at his feet, and, still\r\nsqualling its rage and pain, had sunk its human teeth into the ankle of\r\nhis stout tramping boot.  He, on the other hand, was not idle, and with\r\nhis free foot had done what reduced the squalling to silence.  So inured\r\nto savagery has Bassett since become, that he chuckled again with the\r\nglee of the recollection.\r\n\r\nWhat a night had followed!  Small wonder that he had accumulated such a\r\nvirulence and variety of fevers, he thought, as he recalled that\r\nsleepless night of torment, when the throb of his wounds was as nothing\r\ncompared with the myriad stings of the mosquitoes.  There had been no\r\nescaping them, and he had not dared to light a fire.  They had literally\r\npumped his body full of poison, so that, with the coming of day, eyes\r\nswollen almost shut, he had stumbled blindly on, not caring much when his\r\nhead should be hacked off and his carcass started on the way of Sagawa’s\r\nto the cooking fire.  Twenty-four hours had made a wreck of him—of mind\r\nas well as body.  He had scarcely retained his wits at all, so maddened\r\nwas he by the tremendous inoculation of poison he had received.  Several\r\ntimes he fired his shot-gun with effect into the shadows that dogged him.\r\nStinging day insects and gnats added to his torment, while his bloody\r\nwounds attracted hosts of loathsome flies that clung sluggishly to his\r\nflesh and had to be brushed off and crushed off.\r\n\r\nOnce, in that day, he heard again the wonderful sound, seemingly more\r\ndistant, but rising imperiously above the nearer war-drums in the bush.\r\nRight there was where he had made his mistake.  Thinking that he had\r\npassed beyond it and that, therefore, it was between him and the beach of\r\nRingmanu, he had worked back toward it when in reality he was penetrating\r\ndeeper and deeper into the mysterious heart of the unexplored island.\r\nThat night, crawling in among the twisted roots of a banyan tree, he had\r\nslept from exhaustion while the mosquitoes had had their will of him.\r\n\r\nFollowed days and nights that were vague as nightmares in his memory.\r\nOne clear vision he remembered was of suddenly finding himself in the\r\nmidst of a bush village and watching the old men and children fleeing\r\ninto the jungle.  All had fled but one.  From close at hand and above\r\nhim, a whimpering as of some animal in pain and terror had startled him.\r\nAnd looking up he had seen her—a girl, or young woman rather, suspended\r\nby one arm in the cooking sun.  Perhaps for days she had so hung.  Her\r\nswollen, protruding tongue spoke as much.  Still alive, she gazed at him\r\nwith eyes of terror.  Past help, he decided, as he noted the swellings of\r\nher legs which advertised that the joints had been crushed and the great\r\nbones broken.  He resolved to shoot her, and there the vision terminated.\r\nHe could not remember whether he had or not, any more than could he\r\nremember how he chanced to be in that village, or how he succeeded in\r\ngetting away from it.\r\n\r\nMany pictures, unrelated, came and went in Bassett’s mind as he reviewed\r\nthat period of his terrible wanderings.  He remembered invading another\r\nvillage of a dozen houses and driving all before him with his shot-gun\r\nsave, for one old man, too feeble to flee, who spat at him and whined and\r\nsnarled as he dug open a ground-oven and from amid the hot stones dragged\r\nforth a roasted pig that steamed its essence deliciously through its\r\ngreen-leaf wrappings.  It was at this place that a wantonness of savagery\r\nhad seized upon him.  Having feasted, ready to depart with a hind-quarter\r\nof the pig in his hand, he deliberately fired the grass thatch of a house\r\nwith his burning glass.\r\n\r\nBut seared deepest of all in Bassett’s brain, was the dank and noisome\r\njungle.  It actually stank with evil, and it was always twilight.  Rarely\r\ndid a shaft of sunlight penetrate its matted roof a hundred feet\r\noverhead.  And beneath that roof was an aerial ooze of vegetation, a\r\nmonstrous, parasitic dripping of decadent life-forms that rooted in death\r\nand lived on death.  And through all this he drifted, ever pursued by the\r\nflitting shadows of the anthropophagi, themselves ghosts of evil that\r\ndared not face him in battle but that knew that, soon or late, they would\r\nfeed on him.  Bassett remembered that at the time, in lucid moments, he\r\nhad likened himself to a wounded bull pursued by plains’ coyotes too\r\ncowardly to battle with him for the meat of him, yet certain of the\r\ninevitable end of him when they would be full gorged.  As the bull’s\r\nhorns and stamping hoofs kept off the coyotes, so his shot-gun kept off\r\nthese Solomon Islanders, these twilight shades of bushmen of the island\r\nof Guadalcanal.\r\n\r\nCame the day of the grass lands.  Abruptly, as if cloven by the sword of\r\nGod in the hand of God, the jungle terminated.  The edge of it,\r\nperpendicular and as black as the infamy of it, was a hundred feet up and\r\ndown.  And, beginning at the edge of it, grew the grass—sweet, soft,\r\ntender, pasture grass that would have delighted the eyes and beasts of\r\nany husbandman and that extended, on and on, for leagues and leagues of\r\nvelvet verdure, to the backbone of the great island, the towering\r\nmountain range flung up by some ancient earth-cataclysm, serrated and\r\ngullied but not yet erased by the erosive tropic rains.  But the grass!\r\nHe had crawled into it a dozen yards, buried his face in it, smelled it,\r\nand broken down in a fit of involuntary weeping.\r\n\r\nAnd, while he wept, the wonderful sound had pealed forth—if by _peal_, he\r\nhad often thought since, an adequate description could be given of the\r\nenunciation of so vast a sound melting sweet.  Sweet it was, as no sound\r\never heard.  Vast it was, of so mighty a resonance that it might have\r\nproceeded from some brazen-throated monster.  And yet it called to him\r\nacross that leagues-wide savannah, and was like a benediction to his\r\nlong-suffering, pain racked spirit.\r\n\r\nHe remembered how he lay there in the grass, wet-cheeked but no longer\r\nsobbing, listening to the sound and wondering that he had been able to\r\nhear it on the beach of Ringmanu.  Some freak of air pressures and air\r\ncurrents, he reflected, had made it possible for the sound to carry so\r\nfar.  Such conditions might not happen again in a thousand days or ten\r\nthousand days, but the one day it had happened had been the day he landed\r\nfrom the _Nari_ for several hours’ collecting.  Especially had he been in\r\nquest of the famed jungle butterfly, a foot across from wing-tip to\r\nwing-tip, as velvet-dusky of lack of colour as was the gloom of the roof,\r\nof such lofty arboreal habits that it resorted only to the jungle roof\r\nand could be brought down only by a dose of shot.  It was for this\r\npurpose that Sagawa had carried the ten-gauge shot-gun.\r\n\r\nTwo days and nights he had spent crawling across that belt of grass land.\r\nHe had suffered much, but pursuit had ceased at the jungle-edge.  And he\r\nwould have died of thirst had not a heavy thunderstorm revived him on the\r\nsecond day.\r\n\r\nAnd then had come Balatta.  In the first shade, where the savannah\r\nyielded to the dense mountain jungle, he had collapsed to die.  At first\r\nshe had squealed with delight at sight of his helplessness, and was for\r\nbeating his brain out with a stout forest branch.  Perhaps it was his\r\nvery utter helplessness that had appealed to her, and perhaps it was her\r\nhuman curiosity that made her refrain.  At any rate, she had refrained,\r\nfor he opened his eyes again under the impending blow, and saw her\r\nstudying him intently.  What especially struck her about him were his\r\nblue eyes and white skin.  Coolly she had squatted on her hams, spat on\r\nhis arm, and with her finger-tips scrubbed away the dirt of days and\r\nnights of muck and jungle that sullied the pristine whiteness of his\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nAnd everything about her had struck him especially, although there was\r\nnothing conventional about her at all.  He laughed weakly at the\r\nrecollection, for she had been as innocent of garb as Eve before the\r\nfig-leaf adventure.  Squat and lean at the same time, asymmetrically\r\nlimbed, string-muscled as if with lengths of cordage, dirt-caked from\r\ninfancy save for casual showers, she was as unbeautiful a prototype of\r\nwoman as he, with a scientist’s eye, had ever gazed upon.  Her breasts\r\nadvertised at the one time her maturity and youth; and, if by nothing\r\nelse, her sex was advertised by the one article of finery with which she\r\nwas adorned, namely a pig’s tail, thrust though a hole in her left\r\near-lobe.  So lately had the tail been severed, that its raw end still\r\noozed blood that dried upon her shoulder like so much candle-droppings.\r\nAnd her face!  A twisted and wizened complex of apish features,\r\nperforated by upturned, sky-open, Mongolian nostrils, by a mouth that\r\nsagged from a huge upper-lip and faded precipitately into a retreating\r\nchin, by peering querulous eyes that blinked as blink the eyes of\r\ndenizens of monkey-cages.\r\n\r\nNot even the water she brought him in a forest-leaf, and the ancient and\r\nhalf-putrid chunk of roast pig, could redeem in the slightest the\r\ngrotesque hideousness of her.  When he had eaten weakly for a space, he\r\nclosed his eyes in order not to see her, although again and again she\r\npoked them open to peer at the blue of them.  Then had come the sound.\r\nNearer, much nearer, he knew it to be; and he knew equally well, despite\r\nthe weary way he had come, that it was still many hours distant.  The\r\neffect of it on her had been startling.  She cringed under it, with\r\naverted face, moaning and chattering with fear.  But after it had lived\r\nits full life of an hour, he closed his eyes and fell asleep with Balatta\r\nbrushing the flies from him.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was night, and she was gone.  But he was aware of\r\nrenewed strength, and, by then too thoroughly inoculated by the mosquito\r\npoison to suffer further inflammation, he closed his eyes and slept an\r\nunbroken stretch till sun-up.  A little later Balatta had returned,\r\nbringing with her a half-dozen women who, unbeautiful as they were, were\r\npatently not so unbeautiful as she.  She evidenced by her conduct that\r\nshe considered him her find, her property, and the pride she took in\r\nshowing him off would have been ludicrous had his situation not been so\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nLater, after what had been to him a terrible journey of miles, when he\r\ncollapsed in front of the devil-devil house in the shadow of the\r\nbreadfruit tree, she had shown very lively ideas on the matter of\r\nretaining possession of him.  Ngurn, whom Bassett was to know afterward\r\nas the devil-devil doctor, priest, or medicine man of the village, had\r\nwanted his head.  Others of the grinning and chattering monkey-men, all\r\nas stark of clothes and bestial of appearance as Balatta, had wanted his\r\nbody for the roasting oven.  At that time he had not understood their\r\nlanguage, if by _language_ might be dignified the uncouth sounds they\r\nmade to represent ideas.  But Bassett had thoroughly understood the\r\nmatter of debate, especially when the men pressed and prodded and felt of\r\nthe flesh of him as if he were so much commodity in a butcher’s stall.\r\n\r\nBalatta had been losing the debate rapidly, when the accident happened.\r\nOne of the men, curiously examining Bassett’s shot-gun, managed to cock\r\nand pull a trigger.  The recoil of the butt into the pit of the man’s\r\nstomach had not been the most sanguinary result, for the charge of shot,\r\nat a distance of a yard, had blown the head of one of the debaters into\r\nnothingness.\r\n\r\nEven Balatta joined the others in flight, and, ere they returned, his\r\nsenses already reeling from the oncoming fever-attack, Bassett had\r\nregained possession of the gun.  Whereupon, although his teeth chattered\r\nwith the ague and his swimming eyes could scarcely see, he held on to his\r\nfading consciousness until he could intimidate the bushmen with the\r\nsimple magics of compass, watch, burning glass, and matches.  At the\r\nlast, with due emphasis, of solemnity and awfulness, he had killed a\r\nyoung pig with his shot-gun and promptly fainted.\r\n\r\nBassett flexed his arm-muscles in quest of what possible strength might\r\nreside in such weakness, and dragged himself slowly and totteringly to\r\nhis feet.  He was shockingly emaciated; yet, during the various\r\nconvalescences of the many months of his long sickness, he had never\r\nregained quite the same degree of strength as this time.  What he feared\r\nwas another relapse such as he had already frequently experienced.\r\nWithout drugs, without even quinine, he had managed so far to live\r\nthrough a combination of the most pernicious and most malignant of\r\nmalarial and black-water fevers.  But could he continue to endure?  Such\r\nwas his everlasting query.  For, like the genuine scientist he was, he\r\nwould not be content to die until he had solved the secret of the sound.\r\n\r\nSupported by a staff, he staggered the few steps to the devil-devil house\r\nwhere death and Ngurn reigned in gloom.  Almost as infamously dark and\r\nevil-stinking as the jungle was the devil-devil house—in Bassett’s\r\nopinion.  Yet therein was usually to be found his favourite crony and\r\ngossip, Ngurn, always willing for a yarn or a discussion, the while he\r\nsat in the ashes of death and in a slow smoke shrewdly revolved curing\r\nhuman heads suspended from the rafters.  For, through the months’\r\ninterval of consciousness of his long sickness, Bassett had mastered the\r\npsychological simplicities and lingual difficulties of the language of\r\nthe tribe of Ngurn and Balatta and Vngngn—the latter the addle-headed\r\nyoung chief who was ruled by Ngurn, and who, whispered intrigue had it,\r\nwas the son of Ngurn.\r\n\r\n“Will the Red One speak to-day?” Bassett asked, by this time so\r\naccustomed to the old man’s gruesome occupation as to take even an\r\ninterest in the progress of the smoke-curing.\r\n\r\nWith the eye of an expert Ngurn examined the particular head he was at\r\nwork upon.\r\n\r\n“It will be ten days before I can say ‘finish,’” he said.  “Never has any\r\nman fixed heads like these.”\r\n\r\nBassett smiled inwardly at the old fellow’s reluctance to talk with him\r\nof the Red One.  It had always been so.  Never, by any chance, had Ngurn\r\nor any other member of the weird tribe divulged the slightest hint of any\r\nphysical characteristic of the Red One.  Physical the Red One must be, to\r\nemit the wonderful sound, and though it was called the Red One, Bassett\r\ncould not be sure that red represented the colour of it.  Red enough were\r\nthe deeds and powers of it, from what abstract clues he had gleaned.  Not\r\nalone, had Ngurn informed him, was the Red One more bestial powerful than\r\nthe neighbour tribal gods, ever athirst for the red blood of living human\r\nsacrifices, but the neighbour gods themselves were sacrificed and\r\ntormented before him.  He was the god of a dozen allied villages similar\r\nto this one, which was the central and commanding village of the\r\nfederation.  By virtue of the Red One many alien villages had been\r\ndevastated and even wiped out, the prisoners sacrificed to the Red One.\r\nThis was true to-day, and it extended back into old history carried down\r\nby word of mouth through the generations.  When he, Ngurn, had been a\r\nyoung man, the tribes beyond the grass lands had made a war raid.  In the\r\ncounter raid, Ngurn and his fighting folk had made many prisoners.  Of\r\nchildren alone over five score living had been bled white before the Red\r\nOne, and many, many more men and women.\r\n\r\nThe Thunderer was another of Ngurn’s names for the mysterious deity.\r\nAlso at times was he called The Loud Shouter, The God-Voiced, The\r\nBird-Throated, The One with the Throat Sweet as the Throat of the\r\nHoney-Bird, The Sun Singer, and The Star-Born.\r\n\r\nWhy The Star-Born?  In vain Bassett interrogated Ngurn.  According to\r\nthat old devil-devil doctor, the Red One had always been, just where he\r\nwas at present, for ever singing and thundering his will over men.  But\r\nNgurn’s father, wrapped in decaying grass-matting and hanging even then\r\nover their heads among the smoky rafters of the devil-devil house, had\r\nheld otherwise.  That departed wise one had believed that the Red One\r\ncame from out of the starry night, else why—so his argument had run—had\r\nthe old and forgotten ones passed his name down as the Star-Born?\r\nBassett could not but recognize something cogent in such argument.  But\r\nNgurn affirmed the long years of his long life, wherein he had gazed upon\r\nmany starry nights, yet never had he found a star on grass land or in\r\njungle depth—and he had looked for them.  True, he had beheld shooting\r\nstars (this in reply to Bassett’s contention); but likewise had he beheld\r\nthe phosphorescence of fungoid growths and rotten meat and fireflies on\r\ndark nights, and the flames of wood-fires and of blazing candle-nuts; yet\r\nwhat were flame and blaze and glow when they had flamed and blazed and\r\nglowed?  Answer: memories, memories only, of things which had ceased to\r\nbe, like memories of matings accomplished, of feasts forgotten, of\r\ndesires that were the ghosts of desires, flaring, flaming, burning, yet\r\nunrealized in achievement of easement and satisfaction.  Where was the\r\nappetite of yesterday? the roasted flesh of the wild pig the hunter’s\r\narrow failed to slay? the maid, unwed and dead ere the young man knew\r\nher?\r\n\r\nA memory was not a star, was Ngurn’s contention.  How could a memory be a\r\nstar?  Further, after all his long life he still observed the starry\r\nnight-sky unaltered.  Never had he noted the absence of a single star\r\nfrom its accustomed place.  Besides, stars were fire, and the Red One was\r\nnot fire—which last involuntary betrayal told Bassett nothing.\r\n\r\n“Will the Red One speak to-morrow?” he queried.\r\n\r\nNgurn shrugged his shoulders as who should say.\r\n\r\n“And the day after?—and the day after that?” Bassett persisted.\r\n\r\n“I would like to have the curing of your head,” Ngurn changed the\r\nsubject.  “It is different from any other head.  No devil-devil has a\r\nhead like it.  Besides, I would cure it well.  I would take months and\r\nmonths.  The moons would come and the moons would go, and the smoke would\r\nbe very slow, and I should myself gather the materials for the curing\r\nsmoke.  The skin would not wrinkle.  It would be as smooth as your skin\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nHe stood up, and from the dim rafters, grimed with the smoking of\r\ncountless heads, where day was no more than a gloom, took down a\r\nmatting-wrapped parcel and began to open it.\r\n\r\n“It is a head like yours,” he said, “but it is poorly cured.”\r\n\r\nBassett had pricked up his ears at the suggestion that it was a white\r\nman’s head; for he had long since come to accept that these\r\njungle-dwellers, in the midmost centre of the great island, had never had\r\nintercourse with white men.  Certainly he had found them without the\r\nalmost universal bêche-de-mer English of the west South Pacific.  Nor had\r\nthey knowledge of tobacco, nor of gunpowder.  Their few precious knives,\r\nmade from lengths of hoop-iron, and their few and more precious tomahawks\r\nfrom cheap trade hatchets, he had surmised they had captured in war from\r\nthe bushmen of the jungle beyond the grass lands, and that they, in turn,\r\nhad similarly gained them from the salt-water men who fringed the coral\r\nbeaches of the shore and had contact with the occasional white men.\r\n\r\n“The folk in the out beyond do not know how to cure heads,” old Ngurn\r\nexplained, as he drew forth from the filthy matting and placed in\r\nBassett’s hands an indubitable white man’s head.\r\n\r\nAncient it was beyond question; white it was as the blond hair attested.\r\nHe could have sworn it once belonged to an Englishman, and to an\r\nEnglishman of long before by token of the heavy gold circlets still\r\nthreaded in the withered ear-lobes.\r\n\r\n“Now your head . . . ” the devil-devil doctor began on his favourite\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what,” Bassett interrupted, struck by a new idea.  “When I\r\ndie I’ll let you have my head to cure, if, first, you take me to look\r\nupon the Red One.”\r\n\r\n“I will have your head anyway when you are dead,” Ngurn rejected the\r\nproposition.  He added, with the brutal frankness of the savage:\r\n“Besides, you have not long to live.  You are almost a dead man now.  You\r\nwill grow less strong.  In not many months I shall have you here turning\r\nand turning in the smoke.  It is pleasant, through the long afternoons,\r\nto turn the head of one you have known as well as I know you.  And I\r\nshall talk to you and tell you the many secrets you want to know.  Which\r\nwill not matter, for you will be dead.”\r\n\r\n“Ngurn,” Bassett threatened in sudden anger.  “You know the Baby Thunder\r\nin the Iron that is mine.”  (This was in reference to his all-potent and\r\nall-awful shotgun.)  “I can kill you any time, and then you will not get\r\nmy head.”\r\n\r\n“Just the same, will Vngngn, or some one else of my folk get it,” Ngurn\r\ncomplacently assured him.  “And just the same will it in the end turn\r\ndevil-devil house in the smoke.  The quicker you slay me with your Baby\r\nThunder, the quicker will your head turn in the smoke.”\r\n\r\nAnd Bassett knew he was beaten in the discussion.\r\n\r\nWhat was the Red One?—Bassett asked himself a thousand times in the\r\nsucceeding week, while he seemed to grow stronger.  What was the source\r\nof the wonderful sound?  What was this Sun Singer, this Star-Born One,\r\nthis mysterious deity, as bestial-conducted as the black and kinky-headed\r\nand monkey-like human beasts who worshipped it, and whose silver-sweet,\r\nbull-mouthed singing and commanding he had heard at the taboo distance\r\nfor so long?\r\n\r\nNgurn had he failed to bribe with the inevitable curing of his head when\r\nhe was dead.  Vngngn, imbecile and chief that he was, was too imbecilic,\r\ntoo much under the sway of Ngurn, to be considered.  Remained Balatta,\r\nwho, from the time she found him and poked his blue eyes open to\r\nrecrudescence of her grotesque female hideousness, had continued his\r\nadorer.  Woman she was, and he had long known that the only way to win\r\nfrom her treason of her tribe was through the woman’s heart of her.\r\n\r\nBassett was a fastidious man.  He had never recovered from the initial\r\nhorror caused by Balatta’s female awfulness.  Back in England, even at\r\nbest the charm of woman, to him, had never been robust.  Yet now,\r\nresolutely, as only a man can do who is capable of martyring himself for\r\nthe cause of science, he proceeded to violate all the fineness and\r\ndelicacy of his nature by making love to the unthinkably disgusting\r\nbushwoman.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, but with averted face hid his grimaces and swallowed his\r\ngorge as he put his arm around her dirt-crusted shoulders and felt the\r\ncontact of her rancid oily and kinky hair with his neck and chin.  But he\r\nnearly screamed when she succumbed to that caress so at the very first of\r\nthe courtship and mowed and gibbered and squealed little, queer, pig-like\r\ngurgly noises of delight.  It was too much.  And the next he did in the\r\nsingular courtship was to take her down to the stream and give her a\r\nvigorous scrubbing.\r\n\r\nFrom then on he devoted himself to her like a true swain as frequently\r\nand for as long at a time as his will could override his repugnance.  But\r\nmarriage, which she ardently suggested, with due observance of tribal\r\ncustom, he balked at.  Fortunately, taboo rule was strong in the tribe.\r\nThus, Ngurn could never touch bone, or flesh, or hide of crocodile.  This\r\nhad been ordained at his birth.  Vngngn was denied ever the touch of\r\nwoman.  Such pollution, did it chance to occur, could be purged only by\r\nthe death of the offending female.  It had happened once, since Bassett’s\r\narrival, when a girl of nine, running in play, stumbled and fell against\r\nthe sacred chief.  And the girl-child was seen no more.  In whispers,\r\nBalatta told Bassett that she had been three days and nights in dying\r\nbefore the Red One.  As for Balatta, the breadfruit was taboo to her.\r\nFor which Bassett was thankful.  The taboo might have been water.\r\n\r\nFor himself, he fabricated a special taboo.  Only could he marry, he\r\nexplained, when the Southern Cross rode highest in the sky.  Knowing his\r\nastronomy, he thus gained a reprieve of nearly nine months; and he was\r\nconfident that within that time he would either be dead or escaped to the\r\ncoast with full knowledge of the Red One and of the source of the Red\r\nOne’s wonderful voice.  At first he had fancied the Red One to be some\r\ncolossal statue, like Memnon, rendered vocal under certain temperature\r\nconditions of sunlight.  But when, after a war raid, a batch of prisoners\r\nwas brought in and the sacrifice made at night, in the midst of rain,\r\nwhen the sun could play no part, the Red One had been more vocal than\r\nusual, Bassett discarded that hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn company with Balatta, sometimes with men and parties of women, the\r\nfreedom of the jungle was his for three quadrants of the compass.  But\r\nthe fourth quadrant, which contained the Red One’s abiding place, was\r\ntaboo.  He made more thorough love to Balatta—also saw to it that she\r\nscrubbed herself more frequently.  Eternal female she was, capable of any\r\ntreason for the sake of love.  And, though the sight of her was\r\nprovocative of nausea and the contact of her provocative of despair,\r\nalthough he could not escape her awfulness in his dream-haunted\r\nnightmares of her, he nevertheless was aware of the cosmic verity of sex\r\nthat animated her and that made her own life of less value than the\r\nhappiness of her lover with whom she hoped to mate.  Juliet or Balatta?\r\nWhere was the intrinsic difference?  The soft and tender product of\r\nultra-civilization, or her bestial prototype of a hundred thousand years\r\nbefore her?—there was no difference.\r\n\r\nBassett was a scientist first, a humanist afterward.  In the jungle-heart\r\nof Guadalcanal he put the affair to the test, as in the laboratory he\r\nwould have put to the test any chemical reaction.  He increased his\r\nfeigned ardour for the bushwoman, at the same time increasing the\r\nimperiousness of his will of desire over her to be led to look upon the\r\nRed One face to face.  It was the old story, he recognized, that the\r\nwoman must pay, and it occurred when the two of them, one day, were\r\ncatching the unclassified and unnamed little black fish, an inch long,\r\nhalf-eel and half-scaled, rotund with salmon-golden roe, that frequented\r\nthe fresh water, and that were esteemed, raw and whole, fresh or putrid,\r\na perfect delicacy.  Prone in the muck of the decaying jungle-floor,\r\nBalatta threw herself, clutching his ankles with her hands kissing his\r\nfeet and making slubbery noises that chilled his backbone up and down\r\nagain.  She begged him to kill her rather than exact this ultimate\r\nlove-payment.  She told him of the penalty of breaking the taboo of the\r\nRed One—a week of torture, living, the details of which she yammered out\r\nfrom her face in the mire until he realized that he was yet a tyro in\r\nknowledge of the frightfulness the human was capable of wreaking on the\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nYet did Bassett insist on having his man’s will satisfied, at the woman’s\r\nrisk, that he might solve the mystery of the Red One’s singing, though\r\nshe should die long and horribly and screaming.  And Balatta, being mere\r\nwoman, yielded.  She led him into the forbidden quadrant.  An abrupt\r\nmountain, shouldering in from the north to meet a similar intrusion from\r\nthe south, tormented the stream in which they had fished into a deep and\r\ngloomy gorge.  After a mile along the gorge, the way plunged sharply\r\nupward until they crossed a saddle of raw limestone which attracted his\r\ngeologist’s eye.  Still climbing, although he paused often from sheer\r\nphysical weakness, they scaled forest-clad heights until they emerged on\r\na naked mesa or tableland.  Bassett recognized the stuff of its\r\ncomposition as black volcanic sand, and knew that a pocket magnet could\r\nhave captured a full load of the sharply angular grains he trod upon.\r\n\r\nAnd then holding Balatta by the hand and leading her onward, he came to\r\nit—a tremendous pit, obviously artificial, in the heart of the plateau.\r\nOld history, the South Seas Sailing Directions, scores of remembered data\r\nand connotations swift and furious, surged through his brain.  It was\r\nMendana who had discovered the islands and named them Solomon’s,\r\nbelieving that he had found that monarch’s fabled mines.  They had\r\nlaughed at the old navigator’s child-like credulity; and yet here stood\r\nhimself, Bassett, on the rim of an excavation for all the world like the\r\ndiamond pits of South Africa.\r\n\r\nBut no diamond this that he gazed down upon.  Rather was it a pearl, with\r\nthe depth of iridescence of a pearl; but of a size all pearls of earth\r\nand time, welded into one, could not have totalled; and of a colour\r\nundreamed of in any pearl, or of anything else, for that matter, for it\r\nwas the colour of the Red One.  And the Red One himself Bassett knew it\r\nto be on the instant.  A perfect sphere, full two hundred feet in\r\ndiameter, the top of it was a hundred feet below the level of the rim.\r\nHe likened the colour quality of it to lacquer.  Indeed, he took it to be\r\nsome sort of lacquer, applied by man, but a lacquer too marvellously\r\nclever to have been manufactured by the bush-folk.  Brighter than bright\r\ncherry-red, its richness of colour was as if it were red builded upon\r\nred.  It glowed and iridesced in the sunlight as if gleaming up from\r\nunderlay under underlay of red.\r\n\r\nIn vain Balatta strove to dissuade him from descending.  She threw\r\nherself in the dirt; but, when he continued down the trail that spiralled\r\nthe pit-wall, she followed, cringing and whimpering her terror.  That the\r\nred sphere had been dug out as a precious thing, was patent.  Considering\r\nthe paucity of members of the federated twelve villages and their\r\nprimitive tools and methods, Bassett knew that the toil of a myriad\r\ngenerations could scarcely have made that enormous excavation.\r\n\r\nHe found the pit bottom carpeted with human bones, among which, battered\r\nand defaced, lay village gods of wood and stone.  Some, covered with\r\nobscene totemic figures and designs, were carved from solid tree trunks\r\nforty or fifty feet in length.  He noted the absence of the shark and\r\nturtle gods, so common among the shore villages, and was amazed at the\r\nconstant recurrence of the helmet motive.  What did these jungle savages\r\nof the dark heart of Guadalcanal know of helmets?  Had Mendana’s\r\nmen-at-arms worn helmets and penetrated here centuries before?  And if\r\nnot, then whence had the bush-folk caught the motive?\r\n\r\nAdvancing over the litter of gods and bones, Balatta whimpering at his\r\nheels, Bassett entered the shadow of the Red One and passed on under its\r\ngigantic overhang until he touched it with his finger-tips.  No lacquer\r\nthat.  Nor was the surface smooth as it should have been in the case of\r\nlacquer.  On the contrary, it was corrugated and pitted, with here and\r\nthere patches that showed signs of heat and fusing.  Also, the substance\r\nof it was metal, though unlike any metal, or combination of metals, he\r\nhad ever known.  As for the colour itself, he decided it to be no\r\napplication.  It was the intrinsic colour of the metal itself.\r\n\r\nHe moved his finger-tips, which up to that had merely rested, along the\r\nsurface, and felt the whole gigantic sphere quicken and live and respond.\r\nIt was incredible!  So light a touch on so vast a mass!  Yet did it\r\nquiver under the finger-tip caress in rhythmic vibrations that became\r\nwhisperings and rustlings and mutterings of sound—but of sound so\r\ndifferent; so elusively thin that it was shimmeringly sibilant; so mellow\r\nthat it was maddening sweet, piping like an elfin horn, which last was\r\njust what Bassett decided would be like a peal from some bell of the gods\r\nreaching earthward from across space.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Balatta with swift questioning; but the voice of the Red One\r\nhe had evoked had flung her face downward and moaning among the bones.\r\nHe returned to contemplation of the prodigy.  Hollow it was, and of no\r\nmetal known on earth, was his conclusion.  It was right-named by the ones\r\nof old-time as the Star-Born.  Only from the stars could it have come,\r\nand no thing of chance was it.  It was a creation of artifice and mind.\r\nSuch perfection of form, such hollowness that it certainly possessed,\r\ncould not be the result of mere fortuitousness.  A child of\r\nintelligences, remote and unguessable, working corporally in metals, it\r\nindubitably was.  He stared at it in amaze, his brain a racing wild-fire\r\nof hypotheses to account for this far-journeyer who had adventured the\r\nnight of space, threaded the stars, and now rose before him and above\r\nhim, exhumed by patient anthropophagi, pitted and lacquered by its fiery\r\nbath in two atmospheres.\r\n\r\nBut was the colour a lacquer of heat upon some familiar metal?  Or was it\r\nan intrinsic quality of the metal itself?  He thrust in the blue-point of\r\nhis pocket-knife to test the constitution of the stuff.  Instantly the\r\nentire sphere burst into a mighty whispering, sharp with protest, almost\r\ntwanging goldenly, if a whisper could possibly be considered to twang,\r\nrising higher, sinking deeper, the two extremes of the registry of sound\r\nthreatening to complete the circle and coalesce into the bull-mouthed\r\nthundering he had so often heard beyond the taboo distance.\r\n\r\nForgetful of safety, of his own life itself, entranced by the wonder of\r\nthe unthinkable and unguessable thing, he raised his knife to strike\r\nheavily from a long stroke, but was prevented by Balatta.  She upreared\r\non her own knees in an agony of terror, clasping his knees and\r\nsupplicating him to desist.  In the intensity of her desire to impress\r\nhim, she put her forearm between her teeth and sank them to the bone.\r\n\r\nHe scarcely observed her act, although he yielded automatically to his\r\ngentler instincts and withheld the knife-hack.  To him, human life had\r\ndwarfed to microscopic proportions before this colossal portent of higher\r\nlife from within the distances of the sidereal universe.  As had she been\r\na dog, he kicked the ugly little bushwoman to her feet and compelled her\r\nto start with him on an encirclement of the base.  Part way around, he\r\nencountered horrors.  Even, among the others, did he recognize the\r\nsun-shrivelled remnant of the nine-years girl who had accidentally broken\r\nChief Vngngn’s personality taboo.  And, among what was left of these that\r\nhad passed, he encountered what was left of one who had not yet passed.\r\nTruly had the bush-folk named themselves into the name of the Red One,\r\nseeing in him their own image which they strove to placate and please\r\nwith such red offerings.\r\n\r\nFarther around, always treading the bones and images of humans and gods\r\nthat constituted the floor of this ancient charnel-house of sacrifice, he\r\ncame upon the device by which the Red One was made to send his call\r\nsinging thunderingly across the jungle-belts and grass-lands to the far\r\nbeach of Ringmanu.  Simple and primitive was it as was the Red One’s\r\nconsummate artifice.  A great king-post, half a hundred feet in length,\r\nseasoned by centuries of superstitious care, carven into dynasties of\r\ngods, each superimposed, each helmeted, each seated in the open mouth of\r\na crocodile, was slung by ropes, twisted of climbing vegetable parasites,\r\nfrom the apex of a tripod of three great forest trunks, themselves carved\r\ninto grinning and grotesque adumbrations of man’s modern concepts of art\r\nand god.  From the striker king-post, were suspended ropes of climbers to\r\nwhich men could apply their strength and direction.  Like a battering\r\nram, this king-post could be driven end-onward against the mighty\r\nred-iridescent sphere.\r\n\r\nHere was where Ngurn officiated and functioned religiously for himself\r\nand the twelve tribes under him.  Bassett laughed aloud, almost with\r\nmadness, at the thought of this wonderful messenger, winged with\r\nintelligence across space, to fall into a bushman stronghold and be\r\nworshipped by ape-like, man-eating and head-hunting savages.  It was as\r\nif God’s World had fallen into the muck mire of the abyss underlying the\r\nbottom of hell; as if Jehovah’s Commandments had been presented on carved\r\nstone to the monkeys of the monkey cage at the Zoo; as if the Sermon on\r\nthe Mount had been preached in a roaring bedlam of lunatics.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe slow weeks passed.  The nights, by election, Bassett spent on the\r\nashen floor of the devil-devil house, beneath the ever-swinging,\r\nslow-curing heads.  His reason for this was that it was taboo to the\r\nlesser sex of woman, and therefore, a refuge for him from Balatta, who\r\ngrew more persecutingly and perilously loverly as the Southern Cross rode\r\nhigher in the sky and marked the imminence of her nuptials.  His days\r\nBassett spent in a hammock swung under the shade of the great breadfruit\r\ntree before the devil-devil house.  There were breaks in this programme,\r\nwhen, in the comas of his devastating fever-attacks, he lay for days and\r\nnights in the house of heads.  Ever he struggled to combat the fever, to\r\nlive, to continue to live, to grow strong and stronger against the day\r\nwhen he would be strong enough to dare the grass-lands and the belted\r\njungle beyond, and win to the beach, and to some labour-recruiting,\r\nblack-birding ketch or schooner, and on to civilization and the men of\r\ncivilization, to whom he could give news of the message from other worlds\r\nthat lay, darkly worshipped by beastmen, in the black heart of\r\nGuadalcanal’s midmost centre.\r\n\r\nOn the other nights, lying late under the breadfruit tree, Bassett spent\r\nlong hours watching the slow setting of the western stars beyond the\r\nblack wall of jungle where it had been thrust back by the clearing for\r\nthe village.  Possessed of more than a cursory knowledge of astronomy, he\r\ntook a sick man’s pleasure in speculating as to the dwellers on the\r\nunseen worlds of those incredibly remote suns, to haunt whose houses of\r\nlight, life came forth, a shy visitant, from the rayless crypts of\r\nmatter.  He could no more apprehend limits to time than bounds to space.\r\nNo subversive radium speculations had shaken his steady scientific faith\r\nin the conservation of energy and the indestructibility of matter.\r\nAlways and forever must there have been stars.  And surely, in that\r\ncosmic ferment, all must be comparatively alike, comparatively of the\r\nsame substance, or substances, save for the freaks of the ferment.  All\r\nmust obey, or compose, the same laws that ran without infraction through\r\nthe entire experience of man.  Therefore, he argued and agreed, must\r\nworlds and life be appanages to all the suns as they were appanages to\r\nthe particular of his own solar system.\r\n\r\nEven as he lay here, under the breadfruit tree, an intelligence that\r\nstared across the starry gulfs, so must all the universe be exposed to\r\nthe ceaseless scrutiny of innumerable eyes, like his, though grantedly\r\ndifferent, with behind them, by the same token, intelligences that\r\nquestioned and sought the meaning and the construction of the whole.  So\r\nreasoning, he felt his soul go forth in kinship with that august company,\r\nthat multitude whose gaze was forever upon the arras of infinity.\r\n\r\nWho were they, what were they, those far distant and superior ones who\r\nhad bridged the sky with their gigantic, red-iridescent, heaven-singing\r\nmessage?  Surely, and long since, had they, too, trod the path on which\r\nman had so recently, by the calendar of the cosmos, set his feet.  And to\r\nbe able to send a message across the pit of space, surely they had\r\nreached those heights to which man, in tears and travail and bloody\r\nsweat, in darkness and confusion of many counsels, was so slowly\r\nstruggling.  And what were they on their heights?  Had they won\r\nBrotherhood?  Or had they learned that the law of love imposed the\r\npenalty of weakness and decay?  Was strife, life?  Was the rule of all\r\nthe universe the pitiless rule of natural selection?  And, and most\r\nimmediately and poignantly, were their far conclusions, their long-won\r\nwisdoms, shut even then in the huge, metallic heart of the Red One,\r\nwaiting for the first earth-man to read?  Of one thing he was certain: No\r\ndrop of red dew shaken from the lion-mane of some sun in torment, was the\r\nsounding sphere.  It was of design, not chance, and it contained the\r\nspeech and wisdom of the stars.\r\n\r\nWhat engines and elements and mastered forces, what lore and mysteries\r\nand destiny-controls, might be there!  Undoubtedly, since so much could\r\nbe enclosed in so little a thing as the foundation stone of a public\r\nbuilding, this enormous sphere should contain vast histories, profounds\r\nof research achieved beyond man’s wildest guesses, laws and formulæ that,\r\neasily mastered, would make man’s life on earth, individual and\r\ncollective, spring up from its present mire to inconceivable heights of\r\npurity and power.  It was Time’s greatest gift to blindfold, insatiable,\r\nand sky-aspiring man.  And to him, Bassett, had been vouchsafed the\r\nlordly fortune to be the first to receive this message from man’s\r\ninterstellar kin!\r\n\r\nNo white man, much less no outland man of the other bush-tribes, had\r\ngazed upon the Red One and lived.  Such the law expounded by Ngurn to\r\nBassett.  There was such a thing as blood brotherhood.  Bassett, in\r\nreturn, had often argued in the past.  But Ngurn had stated solemnly no.\r\nEven the blood brotherhood was outside the favour of the Red One.  Only a\r\nman born within the tribe could look upon the Red One and live.  But now,\r\nhis guilty secret known only to Balatta, whose fear of immolation before\r\nthe Red One fast-sealed her lips, the situation was different.  What he\r\nhad to do was to recover from the abominable fevers that weakened him,\r\nand gain to civilization.  Then would he lead an expedition back, and,\r\nalthough the entire population of Guadalcanal he destroyed, extract from\r\nthe heart of the Red One the message of the world from other worlds.\r\n\r\nBut Bassett’s relapses grew more frequent, his brief convalescences less\r\nand less vigorous, his periods of coma longer, until he came to know,\r\nbeyond the last promptings of the optimism inherent in so tremendous a\r\nconstitution as his own, that he would never live to cross the grass\r\nlands, perforate the perilous coast jungle, and reach the sea.  He faded\r\nas the Southern Cross rose higher in the sky, till even Balatta knew that\r\nhe would be dead ere the nuptial date determined by his taboo.  Ngurn\r\nmade pilgrimage personally and gathered the smoke materials for the\r\ncuring of Bassett’s head, and to him made proud announcement and\r\nexhibition of the artistic perfectness of his intention when Bassett\r\nshould be dead.  As for himself, Bassett was not shocked.  Too long and\r\ntoo deeply had life ebbed down in him to bite him with fear of its\r\nimpending extinction.  He continued to persist, alternating periods of\r\nunconsciousness with periods of semi-consciousness, dreamy and unreal, in\r\nwhich he idly wondered whether he had ever truly beheld the Red One or\r\nwhether it was a nightmare fancy of delirium.\r\n\r\nCame the day when all mists and cob-webs dissolved, when he found his\r\nbrain clear as a bell, and took just appraisement of his body’s weakness.\r\nNeither hand nor foot could he lift.  So little control of his body did\r\nhe have, that he was scarcely aware of possessing one.  Lightly indeed\r\nhis flesh sat upon his soul, and his soul, in its briefness of clarity,\r\nknew by its very clarity that the black of cessation was near.  He knew\r\nthe end was close; knew that in all truth he had with his eyes beheld the\r\nRed One, the messenger between the worlds; knew that he would never live\r\nto carry that message to the world—that message, for aught to the\r\ncontrary, which might already have waited man’s hearing in the heart of\r\nGuadalcanal for ten thousand years.  And Bassett stirred with resolve,\r\ncalling Ngurn to him, out under the shade of the breadfruit tree, and\r\nwith the old devil-devil doctor discussing the terms and arrangements of\r\nhis last life effort, his final adventure in the quick of the flesh.\r\n\r\n“I know the law, O Ngurn,” he concluded the matter.  “Whoso is not of the\r\nfolk may not look upon the Red One and live.  I shall not live anyway.\r\nYour young men shall carry me before the face of the Red One, and I shall\r\nlook upon him, and hear his voice, and thereupon die, under your hand, O\r\nNgurn.  Thus will the three things be satisfied: the law, my desire, and\r\nyour quicker possession of my head for which all your preparations wait.”\r\n\r\nTo which Ngurn consented, adding:\r\n\r\n“It is better so.  A sick man who cannot get well is foolish to live on\r\nfor so little a while.  Also is it better for the living that he should\r\ngo.  You have been much in the way of late.  Not but what it was good for\r\nme to talk to such a wise one.  But for moons of days we have held little\r\ntalk.  Instead, you have taken up room in the house of heads, making\r\nnoises like a dying pig, or talking much and loudly in your own language\r\nwhich I do not understand.  This has been a confusion to me, for I like\r\nto think on the great things of the light and dark as I turn the heads in\r\nthe smoke.  Your much noise has thus been a disturbance to the\r\nlong-learning and hatching of the final wisdom that will be mine before I\r\ndie.  As for you, upon whom the dark has already brooded, it is well that\r\nyou die now.  And I promise you, in the long days to come when I turn\r\nyour head in the smoke, no man of the tribe shall come in to disturb us.\r\nAnd I will tell you many secrets, for I am an old man and very wise, and\r\nI shall be adding wisdom to wisdom as I turn your head in the smoke.”\r\n\r\nSo a litter was made, and, borne on the shoulders of half a dozen of the\r\nmen, Bassett departed on the last little adventure that was to cap the\r\ntotal adventure, for him, of living.  With a body of which he was\r\nscarcely aware, for even the pain had been exhausted out of it, and with\r\na bright clear brain that accommodated him to a quiet ecstasy of sheer\r\nlucidness of thought, he lay back on the lurching litter and watched the\r\nfading of the passing world, beholding for the last time the breadfruit\r\ntree before the devil-devil house, the dim day beneath the matted jungle\r\nroof, the gloomy gorge between the shouldering mountains, the saddle of\r\nraw limestone, and the mesa of black volcanic sand.\r\n\r\nDown the spiral path of the pit they bore him, encircling the sheening,\r\nglowing Red One that seemed ever imminent to iridesce from colour and\r\nlight into sweet singing and thunder.  And over bones and logs of\r\nimmolated men and gods they bore him, past the horrors of other immolated\r\nones that yet lived, to the three-king-post tripod and the huge king-post\r\nstriker.\r\n\r\nHere Bassett, helped by Ngurn and Balatta, weakly sat up, swaying weakly\r\nfrom the hips, and with clear, unfaltering, all-seeing eyes gazed upon\r\nthe Red One.\r\n\r\n“Once, O Ngurn,” he said, not taking his eyes from the sheening,\r\nvibrating surface whereon and wherein all the shades of cherry-red played\r\nunceasingly, ever a-quiver to change into sound, to become silken\r\nrustlings, silvery whisperings, golden thrummings of cords, velvet\r\npipings of elfland, mellow distances of thunderings.\r\n\r\n“I wait,” Ngurn prompted after a long pause, the long-handled tomahawk\r\nunassumingly ready in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Once, O Ngurn,” Bassett repeated, “let the Red One speak so that I may\r\nsee it speak as well as hear it.  Then strike, thus, when I raise my\r\nhand; for, when I raise my hand, I shall drop my head forward and make\r\nplace for the stroke at the base of my neck.  But, O Ngurn, I, who am\r\nabout to pass out of the light of day for ever, would like to pass with\r\nthe wonder-voice of the Red One singing greatly in my ears.”\r\n\r\n“And I promise you that never will a head be so well cured as yours,”\r\nNgurn assured him, at the same time signalling the tribesmen to man the\r\npropelling ropes suspended from the king-post striker.  “Your head shall\r\nbe my greatest piece of work in the curing of heads.”\r\n\r\nBassett smiled quietly to the old one’s conceit, as the great carved log,\r\ndrawn back through two-score feet of space, was released.  The next\r\nmoment he was lost in ecstasy at the abrupt and thunderous liberation of\r\nsound.  But such thunder!  Mellow it was with preciousness of all\r\nsounding metals.  Archangels spoke in it; it was magnificently beautiful\r\nbefore all other sounds; it was invested with the intelligence of\r\nsupermen of planets of other suns; it was the voice of God, seducing and\r\ncommanding to be heard.  And—the everlasting miracle of that interstellar\r\nmetal! Bassett, with his own eyes, saw colour and colours transform into\r\nsound till the whole visible surface of the vast sphere was a-crawl and\r\ntitillant and vaporous with what he could not tell was colour or was\r\nsound.  In that moment the interstices of matter were his, and the\r\ninterfusings and intermating transfusings of matter and force.\r\n\r\nTime passed.  At the last Bassett was brought back from his ecstasy by an\r\nimpatient movement of Ngurn.  He had quite forgotten the old devil-devil\r\none.  A quick flash of fancy brought a husky chuckle into Bassett’s\r\nthroat.  His shot-gun lay beside him in the litter.  All he had to do,\r\nmuzzle to head, was to press the trigger and blow his head into\r\nnothingness.\r\n\r\nBut why cheat him? was Bassett’s next thought.  Head-hunting, cannibal\r\nbeast of a human that was as much ape as human, nevertheless Old Ngurn\r\nhad, according to his lights, played squarer than square.  Ngurn was in\r\nhimself a forerunner of ethics and contract, of consideration, and\r\ngentleness in man.  No, Bassett decided; it would be a ghastly pity and\r\nan act of dishonour to cheat the old fellow at the last.  His head was\r\nNgurn’s, and Ngurn’s head to cure it would be.\r\n\r\nAnd Bassett, raising his hand in signal, bending forward his head as\r\nagreed so as to expose cleanly the articulation to his taut spinal cord,\r\nforgot Balatta, who was merely a woman, a woman merely and only and\r\nundesired.  He knew, without seeing, when the razor-edged hatchet rose in\r\nthe air behind him.  And for that instant, ere the end, there fell upon\r\nBassett the shadows of the Unknown, a sense of impending marvel of the\r\nrending of walls before the imaginable.  Almost, when he knew the blow\r\nhad started and just ere the edge of steel bit the flesh and nerves it\r\nseemed that he gazed upon the serene face of the Medusa, Truth—And,\r\nsimultaneous with the bite of the steel on the onrush of the dark, in a\r\nflashing instant of fancy, he saw the vision of his head turning slowly,\r\nalways turning, in the devil-devil house beside the breadfruit tree.\r\n\r\n                                 THE END\r\n\r\nWaikiki, Honolulu,\r\n         _May_ 22, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUSSY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are some stories that have to be true—the sort that cannot be\r\nfabricated by a ready fiction-reckoner.  And by the same token there are\r\nsome men with stories to tell who cannot be doubted.  Such a man was\r\nJulian Jones.  Although I doubt if the average reader of this will\r\nbelieve the story Julian Jones told me.  Nevertheless I believe it.  So\r\nthoroughly am I convinced of its verity that I am willing, nay, eager, to\r\ninvest capital in the enterprise and embark personally on the adventure\r\nto a far land.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Australian Building at the Panama Pacific Exposition that I\r\nmet him.  I was standing before an exhibit of facsimiles of the record\r\nnuggets which had been discovered in the goldfields of the Antipodes.\r\nKnobbed, misshapen and massive, it was as difficult to believe that they\r\nwere not real gold as it was to believe the accompanying statistics of\r\ntheir weights and values.\r\n\r\n“That’s what those kangaroo-hunters call a nugget,” boomed over my\r\nshoulder directly at the largest of the specimens.\r\n\r\nI turned and looked up into the dim blue eyes of Julian Jones.  I looked\r\nup, for he stood something like six feet four inches in height.  His\r\nhair, a wispy, sandy yellow, seemed as dimmed and faded as his eyes.  It\r\nmay have been the sun which had washed out his colouring; at least his\r\nface bore the evidence of a prodigious and ardent sun-burn which had long\r\nsince faded to yellow.  As his eyes turned from the exhibit and focussed\r\non mine I noted a queer look in them as of one who vainly tries to recall\r\nsome fact of supreme importance.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with it as a nugget?”  I demanded.\r\n\r\nThe remote, indwelling expression went out of his eyes as he boomed\r\n\r\n“Why, its size.”\r\n\r\n“It does seem large,” I admitted.  “But there’s no doubt it’s authentic.\r\nThe Australian Government would scarcely dare—”\r\n\r\n“Large!” he interrupted, with a sniff and a sneer.\r\n\r\n“Largest ever discovered—” I started on.\r\n\r\n“Ever discovered!”  His dim eyes smouldered hotly as he proceeded.  “Do\r\nyou think that every lump of gold ever discovered has got into the\r\nnewspapers and encyclopedias?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I replied judicially, “if there’s one that hasn’t, I don’t see\r\nhow we’re to know about it.  If a really big nugget, or nugget-finder,\r\nelects to blush unseen—”\r\n\r\n“But it didn’t,” he broke in quickly.  “I saw it with my own eyes, and,\r\nbesides, I’m too tanned to blush anyway.  I’m a railroad man and I’ve\r\nbeen in the tropics a lot.  Why, I used to be the colour of mahogany—real\r\nold mahogany, and have been taken for a blue-eyed Spaniard more than\r\nonce—”\r\n\r\nIt was my turn to interrupt, and I did.\r\n\r\n“Was that nugget bigger than those in there, Mr.—er—?”\r\n\r\n“Jones, Julian Jones is my name.”\r\n\r\nHe dug into an inner pocket and produced an envelope addressed to such a\r\nperson, care of General Delivery, San Francisco; and I, in turn,\r\npresented him with my card.\r\n\r\n“Pleased to know you, sir,” he said, extending his hand, his voice\r\nbooming as if accustomed to loud noises or wide spaces.  “Of course I’ve\r\nheard of you, seen your picture in the papers, and all that, and, though\r\nI say it that shouldn’t, I want to say that I didn’t care a rap about\r\nthose articles you wrote on Mexico.  You’re wrong, all wrong.  You make\r\nthe mistake of all Gringos in thinking a Mexican is a white man.  He\r\nain’t.  None of them ain’t—Greasers, Spiggoties, Latin-Americans and all\r\nthe rest of the cattle.  Why, sir, they don’t think like we think, or\r\nreason, or act.  Even their multiplication table is different.  You think\r\nseven times seven is forty-nine; but not them.  They work it out\r\ndifferent.  And white isn’t white to them, either.  Let me give you an\r\nexample.  Buying coffee retail for house-keeping in one-pound or\r\nten-pound lots—”\r\n\r\n“How big was that nugget you referred to?” I queried firmly.  “As big as\r\nthe biggest of those?”\r\n\r\n“Bigger,” he said quietly.  “Bigger than the whole blamed exhibit of them\r\nput together, and then some.”  He paused and regarded me with a steadfast\r\ngaze.  “I don’t see no reason why I shouldn’t go into the matter with\r\nyou.  You’ve got a reputation a man ought to be able to trust, and I’ve\r\nread you’ve done some tall skylarking yourself in out-of-the-way places.\r\nI’ve been browsing around with an eye open for some one to go in with me\r\non the proposition.”\r\n\r\n“You can trust me,” I said.\r\n\r\nAnd here I am, blazing out into print with the whole story just as he\r\ntold it to me as we sat on a bench by the lagoon before the Palace of\r\nFine Arts with the cries of the sea gulls in our ears.  Well, he should\r\nhave kept his appointment with me.  But I anticipate.\r\n\r\nAs we started to leave the building and hunt for a seat, a small woman,\r\npossibly thirty years of age, with a washed-out complexion of the\r\nfarmer’s wife sort, darted up to him in a bird-like way, for all the\r\nworld like the darting veering gulls over our heads and fastened herself\r\nto his arm with the accuracy and dispatch and inevitableness of a piece\r\nof machinery.\r\n\r\n“There you go!” she shrilled.  “A-trottin’ right off and never givin’ me\r\na thought.”\r\n\r\nI was formally introduced to her.  It was patent that she had never heard\r\nof me, and she surveyed me bleakly with shrewd black eyes, set close\r\ntogether and as beady and restless as a bird’s.\r\n\r\n“You ain’t goin’ to tell him about that hussy?” she complained.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, Sarah, this is business, you see,” he argued plaintively.\r\n“I’ve been lookin’ for a likely man this long while, and now that he’s\r\nshown up it seems to me I got a right to give him the hang of what\r\nhappened.”\r\n\r\nThe small woman made no reply, but set her thin lips in a needle-like\r\nline.  She gazed straight before her at the Tower of Jewels with so\r\naustere an expression that no glint of refracted sunlight could soften\r\nit.  We proceeded slowly to the lagoon, managed to obtain an unoccupied\r\nseat, and sat down with mutual sighs of relief as we released our weights\r\nfrom our tortured sightseeing feet.\r\n\r\n“One does get so mortal weary,” asserted the small woman, almost\r\ndefiantly.\r\n\r\nTwo swans waddled up from the mirroring water and investigated us.  When\r\ntheir suspicions of our niggardliness or lack of peanuts had been\r\nconfirmed, Jones half-turned his back on his life-partner and gave me his\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n“Ever been in Ecuador?  Then take my advice—and don’t.  Though I take\r\nthat back, for you and me might be hitting it for there together if you\r\ncan rustle up the faith in me and the backbone in yourself for the trip.\r\nWell, anyway, it ain’t so many years ago that I came ambling in there on\r\na rusty, foul-bottomed, tramp collier from Australia, forty-three days\r\nfrom land to land.  Seven knots was her speed when everything favoured,\r\nand we’d had a two weeks’ gale to the north’ard of New Zealand, and broke\r\nour engines down for two days off Pitcairn Island.\r\n\r\n“I was no sailor on her.  I’m a locomotive engineer.  But I’d made\r\nfriends with the skipper at Newcastle an’ come along as his guest for as\r\nfar as Guayaquil.  You see, I’d heard wages was ’way up on the American\r\nrailroad runnin’ from that place over the Andes to Quito.  Now\r\nGuayaquil—”\r\n\r\n“Is a fever-hole,” I interpolated.\r\n\r\nJulian Jones nodded.\r\n\r\n“Thomas Nast died there of it within a month after he landed.—He was our\r\ngreat American cartoonist,” I added.\r\n\r\n“Don’t know him,” Julian Jones said shortly.  “But I do know he wasn’t\r\nthe first to pass out by a long shot.  Why, look you the way I found it.\r\nThe pilot grounds is sixty miles down the river.  ‘How’s the fever?’ said\r\nI to the pilot who came aboard in the early morning.  ‘See that Hamburg\r\nbarque,’ said he, pointing to a sizable ship at anchor.  ‘Captain and\r\nfourteen men dead of it already, and the cook and two men dying right\r\nnow, and they’re the last left of her.’\r\n\r\n“And by jinks he told the truth.  And right then they were dying forty a\r\nday in Guayaquil of Yellow Jack.  But that was nothing, as I was to find\r\nout.  Bubonic plague and small-pox were raging, while dysentery and\r\npneumonia were reducing the population, and the railroad was raging worst\r\nof all.  I mean that.  For them that insisted in riding on it, it was\r\nmore dangerous than all the other diseases put together.\r\n\r\n“When we dropped anchor off Guayaquil half a dozen skippers from other\r\nsteamers came on board to warn our skipper not to let any of his crew or\r\nofficers go ashore except the ones he wanted to lose.  A launch came off\r\nfor me from Duran, which is on the other side of the river and is the\r\nterminal of the railroad.  And it brought off a man that soared up the\r\ngangway three jumps at a time he was that eager to get aboard.  When he\r\nhit the deck he hadn’t time to speak to any of us.  He just leaned out\r\nover the rail and shook his fist at Duran and shouted: ‘I beat you to it!\r\nI beat you to it!’\r\n\r\n“‘Who’d you beat to it, friend?’ I asked.  ‘The railroad,’ he said, as he\r\nunbuckled the straps and took off a big ’44 Colt’s automatic from where\r\nhe wore it handy on his left side under his coat, ‘I staved as long as I\r\nagreed—three months—and it didn’t get me.  I was a conductor.’\r\n\r\n“And that was the railroad I was to work for.  All of which was nothing\r\nto what he told me in the next few minutes.  The road ran from sea level\r\nat Duran up to twelve thousand feet on Chimborazo and down to ten\r\nthousand at Quito on the other side the range.  And it was so dangerous\r\nthat the trains didn’t run nights.  The through passengers had to get off\r\nand sleep in the towns at night while the train waited for daylight.  And\r\neach train carried a guard of Ecuadoriano soldiers which was the most\r\ndangerous of all.  They were supposed to protect the train crews, but\r\nwhenever trouble started they unlimbered their rifles and joined the mob.\r\nYou see, whenever a train wreck occurred, the first cry of the spiggoties\r\nwas ‘Kill the Gringos!’  They always did that, and proceeded to kill the\r\ntrain crew and whatever chance Gringo passengers that’d escaped being\r\nkilled in the accident.  Which is their kind of arithmetic, which I told\r\nyou a while back as being different from ours.\r\n\r\n“Shucks!  Before the day was out I was to find out for myself that that\r\nex-conductor wasn’t lying.  It was over at Duran.  I was to take my run\r\non the first division out to Quito, for which place I was to start next\r\nmorning—only one through train running every twenty-four hours.  It was\r\nthe afternoon of my first day, along about four o’clock, when the boilers\r\nof the _Governor Hancock_ exploded and she sank in sixty feet of water\r\nalongside the dock.  She was the big ferry boat that carried the railroad\r\npassengers across the river to Guayaquil.  It was a bad accident, but it\r\nwas the cause of worse that followed.  By half-past four, big trainloads\r\nbegan to arrive.  It was a feast day and they’d run an excursion up\r\ncountry but of Guayaquil, and this was the crowd coming back.\r\n\r\n“And the crowd—there was five thousand of them—wanted to get ferried\r\nacross, and the ferry was at the bottom of the river, which wasn’t our\r\nfault.  But by the Spiggoty arithmetic, it was.  ‘Kill the Gringos!’\r\nshouts one of them.  And right there the beans were spilled.  Most of us\r\ngot away by the skin of our teeth.  I raced on the heels of the Master\r\nMechanic, carrying one of his babies for him, for the locomotives that\r\nwas just pulling out.  You see, way down there away from everywhere they\r\njust got to save their locomotives in times of trouble, because, without\r\nthem, a railroad can’t be run.  Half a dozen American wives and as many\r\nchildren were crouching on the cab floors along with the rest of us when\r\nwe pulled out; and the Ecuadoriano soldiers, who should have been\r\nprotecting our lives and property, turned loose with their rifles and\r\nmust have given us all of a thousand rounds before we got out of range.\r\n\r\n“We camped up country and didn’t come back to clean up until next day.\r\nIt was some cleaning.  Every flat-car, box-car, coach, asthmatic switch\r\nengine, and even hand-car that mob of Spiggoties had shoved off the dock\r\ninto sixty feet of water on top of the _Governor Hancock_.  They’d burnt\r\nthe round house, set fire to the coal bunkers, and made a scandal of the\r\nrepair shops.  Oh, yes, and there were three of our fellows they’d got\r\nthat we had to bury mighty quick.  It’s hot weather all the time down\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nJulian Jones came to a full pause and over his shoulder studied the\r\nstraight-before-her gaze and forbidding expression of his wife’s face.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t forgotten the nugget,” he assured me.\r\n\r\n“Nor the hussy,” the little woman snapped, apparently at the mud-hens\r\npaddling on the surface of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been travelling toward the nugget right along—”\r\n\r\n“There was never no reason for you to stay in that dangerous country,”\r\nhis wife snapped in on him.\r\n\r\n“Now, Sarah,” he appealed.  “I was working for you right along.”  And to\r\nme he explained: “The risk was big, but so was the pay.  Some months I\r\nearned as high as five hundred gold.  And here was Sarah waiting for me\r\nback in Nebraska—”\r\n\r\n“An’ us engaged two years,” she complained to the Tower of Jewels.\r\n\r\n“—What of the strike, and me being blacklisted, and getting typhoid down\r\nin Australia, and everything,” he went on.  “And luck was with me on that\r\nrailroad.  Why, I saw fellows fresh from the States pass out, some of\r\nthem not a week on their first run.  If the diseases and the railroad\r\ndidn’t get them, then it was the Spiggoties got them.  But it just wasn’t\r\nmy fate, even that time I rode my engine down to the bottom of a\r\nforty-foot washout.  I lost my fireman; and the conductor and the\r\nSuperintendent of Rolling Stock (who happened to be running down to Duran\r\nto meet his bride) had their heads knifed off by the Spiggoties and\r\nparaded around on poles.  But I lay snug as a bug under a couple of feet\r\nof tender coal, and they thought I’d headed for tall timber—lay there a\r\nday and a night till the excitement cooled down.  Yes, I was lucky.  The\r\nworst that happened to me was I caught a cold once, and another time had\r\na carbuncle.  But the other fellows!  They died like flies, what of\r\nYellow Jack, pneumonia, the Spiggoties, and the railroad.  The trouble\r\nwas I didn’t have much chance to pal with them.  No sooner’d I get some\r\nintimate with one of them he’d up and die—all but a fireman named\r\nAndrews, and he went loco for keeps.\r\n\r\n“I made good on my job from the first, and lived in Quito in a ’dobe\r\nhouse with whacking big Spanish tiles on the roof that I’d rented.  And I\r\nnever had much trouble with the Spiggoties, what of letting them sneak\r\nfree rides in the tender or on the cowcatcher.  Me throw them off?\r\nNever!  I took notice, when Jack Harris put off a bunch of them, that I\r\nattended his funeral _muy pronto_—”\r\n\r\n“Speak English,” the little woman beside him snapped.\r\n\r\n“Sarah just can’t bear to tolerate me speaking Spanish,” he apologized.\r\n“It gets so on her nerves that I promised not to.  Well, as I was saying,\r\nthe goose hung high and everything was going hunky-dory, and I was piling\r\nup my wages to come north to Nebraska and marry Sarah, when I run on to\r\nVahna—”\r\n\r\n“The hussy!” Sarah hissed.\r\n\r\n“Now, Sarah,” her towering giant of a husband begged, “I just got to\r\nmention her or I can’t tell about the nugget.—It was one night when I was\r\ntaking a locomotive—no train—down to Amato, about thirty miles from\r\nQuito.  Seth Manners was my fireman.  I was breaking him in to engineer\r\nfor himself, and I was letting him run the locomotive while I sat up in\r\nhis seat meditating about Sarah here.  I’d just got a letter from her,\r\nbegging as usual for me to come home and hinting as usual about the\r\ndangers of an unmarried man like me running around loose in a country\r\nfull of senoritas and fandangos.  Lord!  If she could only a-seen them.\r\nPositive frights, that’s what they are, their faces painted white as\r\ncorpses and their lips red as—as some of the train wrecks I’ve helped\r\nclean up.\r\n\r\n“It was a lovely April night, not a breath of wind, and a tremendous big\r\nmoon shining right over the top of Chimborazo.—Some mountain that.  The\r\nrailroad skirted it twelve thousand feet above sea level, and the top of\r\nit ten thousand feet higher than that.\r\n\r\n“Mebbe I was drowsing, with Seth running the engine; but he slammed on\r\nthe brakes so sudden hard that I darn near went through the cab window.\r\n\r\n“‘What the—’ I started to yell, and ‘Holy hell,’ Seth says, as both of us\r\nlooked at what was on the track.  And I agreed with Seth entirely in his\r\nremark.  It was an Indian girl—and take it from me, Indians ain’t\r\nSpiggoties by any manner of means.  Seth had managed to fetch a stop\r\nwithin twenty feet of her, and us bowling down hill at that!  But the\r\ngirl.  She—”\r\n\r\nI saw the form of Mrs. Julian Jones stiffen, although she kept her gaze\r\nfixed balefully upon two mud-hens that were prowling along the lagoon\r\nshallows below us.  “The hussy!” she hissed, once and implacably.  Jones\r\nhad stopped at the sound, but went on immediately.\r\n\r\n“She was a tall girl, slim and slender, you know the kind, with black\r\nhair, remarkably long hanging, down loose behind her, as she stood there\r\nno more afraid than nothing, her arms spread out to stop the engine.  She\r\nwas wearing a slimpsy sort of garment wrapped around her that wasn’t\r\ncloth but ocelot skins, soft and dappled, and silky.  It was all she had\r\non—”\r\n\r\n“The hussy!” breathed Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jones went on, making believe that he was unaware of the\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n“‘Hell of a way to stop a locomotive,’ I complained at Seth, as I climbed\r\ndown on to the right of way.  I walked past our engine and up to the\r\ngirl, and what do you think?  Her eyes were shut tight.  She was\r\ntrembling that violent that you would see it by the moonlight.  And she\r\nwas barefoot, too.\r\n\r\n“‘What’s the row?’ I said, none too gentle.  She gave a start, seemed to\r\ncome out of her trance, and opened her eyes.  Say!  They were big and\r\nblack and beautiful.  Believe me, she was some looker—”\r\n\r\n“The hussy!”  At which hiss the two mud-hens veered away a few feet.  But\r\nJones was getting himself in hand, and didn’t even blink.\r\n\r\n“‘What are you stopping this locomotive for?’ I demanded in Spanish.\r\nNary an answer.  She stared at me, then at the snorting engine and then\r\nburst into tears, which you’ll admit is uncommon behaviour for an Indian\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n“‘If you try to get rides that way,’ I slung at her in Spiggoty Spanish\r\n(which they tell me is some different from regular Spanish), ‘you’ll be\r\ntaking one smeared all over our cowcatcher and headlight, and it’ll be up\r\nto my fireman to scrape you off.’\r\n\r\n“My Spiggoty Spanish wasn’t much to brag on, but I could see she\r\nunderstood, though she only shook her head and wouldn’t speak.  But great\r\nMoses, she was some looker—”\r\n\r\nI glanced apprehensively at Mrs. Jones, who must have caught me out of\r\nthe tail of her eye, for she muttered: “If she hadn’t been do you think\r\nhe’d a-taken her into his house to live?”\r\n\r\n“Now hold on, Sarah,” he protested.  “That ain’t fair.  Besides, I’m\r\ntelling this.—Next thing, Seth yells at me, ‘Goin’ to stay here all\r\nnight?’\r\n\r\n“‘Come on,’ I said to the girl, ‘and climb on board.  But next time you\r\nwant a ride don’t flag a locomotive between stations.’  She followed\r\nalong; but when I got to the step and turned to give her a lift-up, she\r\nwasn’t there.  I went forward again.  Not a sign of her.  Above and below\r\nwas sheer cliff, and the track stretched ahead a hundred yards clear and\r\nempty.  And then I spotted her, crouched down right against the\r\ncowcatcher, that close I’d almost stepped on her.  If we’d started up,\r\nwe’d have run over her in a second.  It was all so nonsensical, I never\r\ncould make out her actions.  Maybe she was trying to suicide.  I grabbed\r\nher by the wrist and jerked her none too gentle to her feet.  And she\r\ncame along all right.  Women do know when a man means business.”\r\n\r\nI glanced from this Goliath to his little, bird-eyed spouse, and wondered\r\nif he had ever tried to mean business with her.\r\n\r\n“Seth kicked at first, but I boosted her into the cab and made her sit up\r\nbeside me—”\r\n\r\n“And I suppose Seth was busy running the engine,” Mrs. Jones observed.\r\n\r\n“I was breaking him in, wasn’t I?”  Mr. Jones protested.  “So we made the\r\nrun into Amato.  She’d never opened her mouth once, and no sooner’d the\r\nengine stopped than she’d jumped to the ground and was gone.  Just like\r\nthat.  Not a thank you kindly.  Nothing.\r\n\r\n“But next morning when we came to pull out for Quito with a dozen flat\r\ncars loaded with rails, there she was in the cab waiting for us; and in\r\nthe daylight I could see how much better a looker she was than the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“‘Huh! she’s adopted you,’ Seth grins.  And it looked like it.  She just\r\nstood there and looked at me—at us—like a loving hound dog that you love,\r\nthat you’ve caught with a string of sausages inside of him, and that just\r\nknows you ain’t going to lift a hand to him.  ‘Go chase yourself!’ I told\r\nher _pronto_.”  (Mrs. Jones her proximity noticeable with a wince at the\r\nSpanish word.)  “You see, Sarah, I’d no use for her, even at the start.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones stiffened.  Her lips moved soundlessly, but I knew to what\r\nsyllables.\r\n\r\n“And what made it hardest was Seth jeering at me.  ‘You can’t shake her\r\nthat way,’ he said.  ‘You saved her life—’  ‘I didn’t,’ I said sharply;\r\n‘it was you.’  ‘But she thinks you did, which is the same thing,’ he came\r\nback at me.  ‘And now she belongs to you.  Custom of the country, as you\r\nought to know.’”\r\n\r\n“Heathenish,” said Mrs. Jones, and though her steady gaze was set upon\r\nthe Tower of Jewels I knew she was making no reference to its\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n“‘She’s come to do light housekeeping for you,’ Seth grinned.  I let him\r\nrave, though afterwards I kept him throwing in the coal too fast to work\r\nhis mouth very much.  Why, say, when I got to the spot where I picked her\r\nup, and stopped the train for her to get off, she just flopped down on\r\nher knees, got a hammerlock with her arms around my knees, and cried all\r\nover my shoes.  What was I to do?”\r\n\r\nWith no perceptible movement that I was aware of, Mrs. Jones advertised\r\nher certitude of knowledge of what _she_ would have done.\r\n\r\n“And the moment we pulled into Quito, she did what she’d done\r\nbefore—vanished.  Sarah never believes me when I say how relieved I felt\r\nto be quit of her.  But it was not to be.  I got to my ’dobe house and\r\nmanaged a cracking fine dinner my cook had ready for me.  She was mostly\r\nSpiggoty and half Indian, and her name was Paloma.—Now, Sarah, haven’t I\r\ntold you she was older’n a grandmother, and looked more like a buzzard\r\nthan a dove?  Why, I couldn’t bear to eat with her around where I could\r\nlook at her.  But she did make things comfortable, and she was some\r\neconomical when it came to marketing.\r\n\r\n“That afternoon, after a big long siesta, what’d I find in the kitchen,\r\njust as much at home as if she belonged there, but that blamed Indian\r\ngirl.  And old Paloma was squatting at the girl’s feet and rubbing the\r\ngirl’s knees and legs like for rheumatism, which I knew the girl didn’t\r\nhave from the way I’d sized up the walk of her, and keeping time to the\r\nrubbing with a funny sort of gibberish chant.  And I let loose right\r\nthere and then.  As Sarah knows, I never could a-bear women around the\r\nhouse—young, unmarried women, I mean.  But it was no go!  Old Paloma\r\nsided with the girl, and said if the girl went she went, too.  Also, she\r\ncalled me more kinds of a fool than the English language has\r\naccommodation for.  You’d like the Spanish lingo, Sarah, for expressing\r\nyourself in such ways, and you’d have liked old Paloma, too.  She was a\r\ngood woman, though she didn’t have any teeth and her face could kill a\r\nstrong man’s appetite in the cradle.\r\n\r\n“I gave in.  I had to.  Except for the excuse that she needed Vahna’s\r\nhelp around the house (which she didn’t at all), old Paloma never said\r\nwhy she stuck up for the girl.  Anyway, Vahna was a quiet thing, never in\r\nthe way.  And she never gadded.  Just sat in-doors jabbering with Paloma\r\nand helping with the chores.  But I wasn’t long in getting on to that she\r\nwas afraid of something.  She would look up, that anxious it hurt,\r\nwhenever anybody called, like some of the boys to have a gas or a game of\r\npedro.  I tried to worm it out of Paloma what was worrying the girl, but\r\nall the old woman did was to look solemn and shake her head like all the\r\ndevils in hell was liable to precipitate a visit on us.\r\n\r\n“And then one day Vahna had a visitor.  I’d just come in from a run and\r\nwas passing the time of day with her—I had to be polite, even if she had\r\nbutted in on me and come to live in my house for keeps—when I saw a queer\r\nexpression come into her eyes.  In the doorway stood an Indian boy.  He\r\nlooked like her, but was younger and slimmer.  She took him into the\r\nkitchen and they must have had a great palaver, for he didn’t leave until\r\nafter dark.  Inside the week he came back, but I missed him.  When I got\r\nhome, Paloma put a fat nugget of gold into my hand, which Vahna had sent\r\nhim for.  The blamed thing weighed all of two pounds and was worth more\r\nthan five hundred dollars.  She explained that Vahna wanted me to take it\r\nto pay for her keep.  And I had to take it to keep peace in the house.\r\n\r\n“Then, after a long time, came another visitor.  We were sitting before\r\nthe fire—”\r\n\r\n“Him and the hussy,” quoth Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\n“And Paloma,” he added quickly.\r\n\r\n“Him and his cook and his light housekeeper sitting by the fire,” she\r\namended.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I admit Vahna did like me a whole heap,” he asserted recklessly,\r\nthen modified with a pang of caution: “A heap more than was good for her,\r\nseeing that I had no inclination her way.\r\n\r\n“Well, as I was saying, she had another visitor.  He was a lean, tall,\r\nwhite-headed old Indian, with a beak on him like an eagle.  He walked\r\nright in without knocking.  Vahna gave a little cry that was half like a\r\nyelp and half like a gasp, and flumped down on her knees before me,\r\npleading to me with deer’s eyes and to him with the eyes of a deer about\r\nto be killed that don’t want to be killed.  Then, for a minute that\r\nseemed as long as a life-time, she and the old fellow glared at each\r\nother.  Paloma was the first to talk, in his own lingo, for he talked\r\nback to her.  But great Moses, if he wasn’t the high and mighty one!\r\nPaloma’s old knees were shaking, and she cringed to him like a hound dog.\r\nAnd all this in my own house!  I’d have thrown him out on his neck, only\r\nhe was so old.\r\n\r\n“If the things he said to Vahna were as terrible as the way he looked!\r\nSay!  He just spit words at her!  But Paloma kept whimpering and butting\r\nin, till something she said got across, because his face relaxed.  He\r\ncondescended to give me the once over and fired some question at Vahna.\r\nShe hung her head, and looked foolish, and blushed, and then replied with\r\na single word and a shake of the head.  And with that he just naturally\r\nturned on his heel and beat it.  I guess she’d said ‘No.’\r\n\r\n“For some time after that Vahna used to fluster up whenever she saw me.\r\nThen she took to the kitchen for a spell.  But after a long time she\r\nbegan hanging around the big room again.  She was still mighty shy, but\r\nshe’d keep on following me about with those big eyes of hers—”\r\n\r\n“The hussy!” I heard plainly.  But Julian Jones and I were pretty well\r\nused to it by this time.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind saying that I was getting some interested myself—oh, not in\r\nthe way Sarah never lets up letting me know she thinks.  That two-pound\r\nnugget was what had me going.  If Vahna’d put me wise to where it came\r\nfrom, I could say good-bye to railroading and hit the high places for\r\nNebraska and Sarah.\r\n\r\n“And then the beans were spilled . . . by accident.  Come a letter from\r\nWisconsin.  My Aunt Eliza ’d died and up and left me her big farm.  I let\r\nout a whoop when I read it; but I could have canned my joy, for I was\r\njobbed out of it by the courts and lawyers afterward—not a cent to me,\r\nand I’m still paying ’m in instalments.\r\n\r\n“But I didn’t know, then; and I prepared to pull back to God’s country.\r\nPaloma got sore, and Vahna got the weeps.  ‘Don’t go!  Don’t go!’  That\r\nwas her song.  But I gave notice on my job, and wrote a letter to Sarah\r\nhere—didn’t I, Sarah?\r\n\r\n“That night, sitting by the fire like at a funeral, Vahna really loosened\r\nup for the first time.\r\n\r\n“‘Don’t go,’ she says to me, with old Paloma nodding agreement with her.\r\n‘I’ll show you where my brother got the nugget, if you don’t go.’  ‘Too\r\nlate,’ said I.  And I told her why.\r\n\r\n“And told her about me waiting for you back in Nebraska,” Mrs. Jones\r\nobserved in cold, passionless tones.\r\n\r\n“Now, Sarah, why should I hurt a poor Indian girl’s feelings?  Of course\r\nI didn’t.\r\n\r\n“Well, she and Paloma talked Indian some more, and then Vahna says: ‘If\r\nyou stay, I’ll show you the biggest nugget that is the father of all\r\nother nuggets.’  ‘How big?’ I asked.  ‘As big as me?’  She laughed.\r\n‘Bigger than you,’ she says, ‘much, much bigger.’  ‘They don’t grow that\r\nway,’ I said.  But she said she’d seen it and Paloma backed her up.  Why,\r\nto listen to them you’d have thought there was millions in that one\r\nnugget.  Paloma ’d never seen it herself, but she’d heard about it.  A\r\nsecret of the tribe which she couldn’t share, being only half Indian\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\nJulian Jones paused and heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n“And they kept on insisting until I fell for—”\r\n\r\n“The hussy,” said Mrs. Jones, pert as a bird, at the ready instant.\r\n\r\n“‘No; for the nugget.  What of Aunt Eliza’s farm I was rich enough to\r\nquit railroading, but not rich enough to turn my back on big money—and I\r\njust couldn’t help believing them two women.  Gee!  I could be another\r\nVanderbilt, or J. P. Morgan.  That’s the way I thought; and I started in\r\nto pump Vahna.  But she wouldn’t give down.  ‘You come along with me,’\r\nshe says.  ‘We can be back here in a couple of weeks with all the gold\r\nthe both of us can carry.’  ‘We’ll take a burro, or a pack-train of\r\nburros,’ was my suggestion.  But nothing doing.  And Paloma agreed with\r\nher.  It was too dangerous.  The Indians would catch us.\r\n\r\n“The two of us pulled out when the nights were moonlight.  We travelled\r\nonly at night, and laid up in the days.  Vahna wouldn’t let me light a\r\nfire, and I missed my coffee something fierce.  We got up in the real\r\nhigh mountains of the main Andes, where the snow on one pass gave us some\r\ntrouble; but the girl knew the trails, and, though we didn’t waste any\r\ntime, we were a full week getting there.  I know the general trend of our\r\ntravel, because I carried a pocket compass; and the general trend is all\r\nI need to get there again, because of that peak.  There’s no mistaking\r\nit.  There ain’t another peak like it in the world.  Now, I’m not telling\r\nyou its particular shape, but when you and I head out for it from Quito\r\nI’ll take you straight to it.\r\n\r\n“It’s no easy thing to climb, and the person doesn’t live that can climb\r\nit at night.  We had to take the daylight to it, and didn’t reach the top\r\ntill after sunset.  Why, I could take hours and hours telling you about\r\nthat last climb, which I won’t.  The top was flat as a billiard table,\r\nabout a quarter of an acre in size, and was almost clean of snow.  Vahna\r\ntold me that the great winds that usually blew, kept the snow off of it.\r\n\r\n“We were winded, and I got mountain sickness so bad that I had to stretch\r\nout for a spell.  Then, when the moon come up, I took a prowl around.  It\r\ndidn’t take long, and I didn’t catch a sight or a smell of anything that\r\nlooked like gold.  And when I asked Vahna, she only laughed and clapped\r\nher hands.  Meantime my mountain sickness tuned up something fierce, and\r\nI sat down on a big rock to wait for it to ease down.\r\n\r\n“‘Come on, now,’ I said, when I felt better.  ‘Stop your fooling and tell\r\nme where that nugget is.’  ‘It’s nearer to you right now than I’ll ever\r\nget,’ she answered, her big eyes going sudden wistful.  ‘All you Gringos\r\nare alike.  Gold is the love of your heart, and women don’t count much.’\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say anything.  That was no time to tell her about Sarah here.\r\nBut Vahna seemed to shake off her depressed feelings, and began to laugh\r\nand tease again.  ‘How do you like it?’ she asked.  ‘Like what?’  ‘The\r\nnugget you’re sitting on.’\r\n\r\n“I jumped up as though it was a red-hot stove.  And all it was was a\r\nrock.  I felt nay heart sink.  Either she had gone clean loco or this was\r\nher idea of a joke.  Wrong on both counts.  She gave me the hatchet and\r\ntold me to take a hack at the boulder, which I did, again and again, for\r\nyellow spots sprang up from under every blow.  By the great Moses! it was\r\ngold!  The whole blamed boulder!”\r\n\r\nJones rose suddenly to his full height and flung out his long arms, his\r\nface turned to the southern skies.  The movement shot panic into the\r\nheart of a swan that had drawn nearer with amiably predatory designs.\r\nIts consequent abrupt retreat collided it with a stout old lady, who\r\nsquealed and dropped her bag of peanuts.  Jones sat down and resumed.\r\n\r\n“Gold, I tell you, solid gold and that pure and soft that I chopped chips\r\nout of it.  It had been coated with some sort of rain-proof paint or\r\nlacquer made out of asphalt or something.  No wonder I’d taken it for a\r\nrock.  It was ten feet long, all of five feet through, and tapering to\r\nboth ends like an egg.  Here.  Take a look at this.”\r\n\r\nFrom his pocket he drew and opened a leather case, from which he took an\r\nobject wrapped in tissue-paper.  Unwrapping it, he dropped into my hand a\r\nchip of pure soft gold, the size of a ten-dollar gold-piece.  I could\r\nmake out the greyish substance on one side with which it had been\r\npainted.\r\n\r\n“I chopped that from one end of the thing,” Jones went on, replacing the\r\nchip in its paper and leather case.  “And lucky I put it in my pocket.\r\nFor right at my back came one loud word—more like a croak than a word, in\r\nmy way of thinking.  And there was that lean old fellow with the eagle\r\nbeak that had dropped in on us one night.  And there was about thirty\r\nIndians with him—all slim young fellows.\r\n\r\n“Vahna’d flopped down and begun whimpering, but I told her, ‘Get up and\r\nmake friends with them for me.’  ‘No, no,’ she cried.  ‘This is death.\r\nGood-bye, _amigo_—’”\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Jones winced, and her husband abruptly checked the particular\r\nflow of his narrative.\r\n\r\n“‘Then get up and fight along with me,’ I said to her.  And she did.  She\r\nwas some hellion, there on the top of the world, clawing and scratching\r\ntooth and nail—a regular she cat.  And I wasn’t idle, though all I had\r\nwas that hatchet and my long arms.  But they were too many for me, and\r\nthere was no place for me to put my back against a wall.  When I come to,\r\nminutes after they’d cracked me on the head—here, feel this.”\r\n\r\nRemoving his hat, Julian Jones guided my finger tips through his thatch\r\nof sandy hair until they sank into an indentation.  It was fully three\r\ninches long, and went into the bone itself of the skull.\r\n\r\n“When I come to, there was Vahna spread-eagled on top of the nugget, and\r\nthe old fellow with a beak jabbering away solemnly as if going through\r\nsome sort of religious exercises.  In his hand he had a stone knife—you\r\nknow, a thin, sharp sliver of some obsidian-like stuff same as they make\r\narrow-heads out of.  I couldn’t lift a hand, being held down, and being\r\ntoo weak besides.  And—well, anyway, that stone knife did for her, and me\r\nthey didn’t even do the honour of killing there on top their sacred peak.\r\nThey chucked me off of it like so much carrion.\r\n\r\n“And the buzzards didn’t get me either.  I can see the moonlight yet,\r\nshining on all those peaks of snow, as I went down.  Why, sir, it was a\r\nfive-hundred-foot fall, only I didn’t make it.  I went into a big\r\nsnow-drift in a crevice.  And when I come to (hours after I know, for it\r\nwas full day when I next saw the sun), I found myself in a regular\r\nsnow-cave or tunnel caused by the water from the melting snow running\r\nalong the ledge.  In fact, the stone above actually overhung just beyond\r\nwhere I first landed.  A few feet more to the side, either way, and I’d\r\nalmost be going yet.  It was a straight miracle, that’s what it was.\r\n\r\n“But I paid for it.  It was two years and over before I knew what\r\nhappened.  All I knew was that I was Julian Jones and that I’d been\r\nblacklisted in the big strike, and that I was married to Sarah here.  I\r\nmean that.  I didn’t know anything in between, and when Sarah tried to\r\ntalk about it, it gave me pains in the head.  I mean my head was queer,\r\nand I knew it was queer.\r\n\r\n“And then, sitting on the porch of her father’s farmhouse back in\r\nNebraska one moonlight evening, Sarah came out and put that gold chip\r\ninto my hand.  Seems she’d just found it in the torn lining of the trunk\r\nI’d brought back from Ecuador—I who for two years didn’t even know I’d\r\nbeen to Ecuador, or Australia, or anything!  Well, I just sat there\r\nlooking at the chip in the moonlight, and turning it over and over and\r\nfiguring what it was and where it’d come from, when all of a sudden there\r\nwas a snap inside my head as if something had broken, and then I could\r\nsee Vahna spread-eagled on that big nugget and the old fellow with the\r\nbeak waving the stone knife, and . . . and everything.  That is,\r\neverything that had happened from the time I first left Nebraska to when\r\nI crawled to the daylight out of the snow after they had chucked me off\r\nthe mountain-top.  But everything that’d happened after that I’d clean\r\nforgotten.  When Sarah said I was her husband, I wouldn’t listen to her.\r\nTook all her family and the preacher that’d married us to convince me.\r\n\r\n“Later on I wrote to Seth Manners.  The railroad hadn’t killed him yet,\r\nand he pieced out a lot for me.  I’ll show you his letters.  I’ve got\r\nthem at the hotel.  One day, he said, making his regular run, I crawled\r\nout on to the track.  I didn’t stand upright, I just crawled.  He took me\r\nfor a calf, or a big dog, at first.  I wasn’t anything human, he said,\r\nand I didn’t know him or anything.  As near as I can make out, it was ten\r\ndays after the mountain-top to the time Seth picked me up.  What I ate I\r\ndon’t know.  Maybe I didn’t eat.  Then it was doctors at Quito, and\r\nPaloma nursing me (she must have packed that gold chip in my trunk),\r\nuntil they found out I was a man without a mind, and the railroad sent me\r\nback to Nebraska.  At any rate, that’s what Seth writes me.  Of myself, I\r\ndon’t know.  But Sarah here knows.  She corresponded with the railroad\r\nbefore they shipped me and all that.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones nodded affirmation of his words, sighed and evidenced\r\nunmistakable signs of eagerness to go.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t been able to work since,” her husband continued.  “And I ain’t\r\nbeen able to figure out how to get back that big nugget.  Sarah’s got\r\nmoney of her own, and she won’t let go a penny—”\r\n\r\n“He won’t get down to _that_ country no more!” she broke forth.\r\n\r\n“But, Sarah, Vahna’s dead—you know that,” Julian Jones protested.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about anything,” she answered decisively, “except\r\nthat _that_ country is no place for a married man.”\r\n\r\nHer lips snapped together, and she fixed an unseeing stare across to\r\nwhere the afternoon sun was beginning to glow into sunset.  I gazed for a\r\nmoment at her face, white, plump, tiny, and implacable, and gave her up.\r\n\r\n“How do you account for such a mass of gold being there?” I queried of\r\nJulian Jones.  “A solid-gold meteor that fell out of the sky?”\r\n\r\n“Not for a moment.”  He shook his head.  “ It was carried there by the\r\nIndians.”\r\n\r\n“Up a mountain like that—and such enormous weight and size!” I objected.\r\n\r\n“Just as easy,” he smiled.  “I used to be stumped by that proposition\r\nmyself, after I got my memory back.  Now how in Sam Hill—’ I used to\r\nbegin, and then spend hours figuring at it.  And then when I got the\r\nanswer I felt downright idiotic, it was that easy.”  He paused, then\r\nannounced: “They didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“But you just—said they did.”\r\n\r\n“They did and they didn’t,” was his enigmatic reply.  “Of course they\r\nnever carried that monster nugget up there.  What they did was to carry\r\nup its contents.”\r\n\r\nHe waited until he saw enlightenment dawn in my face.\r\n\r\n“And then of course melted all the gold, or welded it, or smelted it, all\r\ninto one piece.  You know the first Spaniards down there, under a leader\r\nnamed Pizarro, were a gang of robbers and cut-throats.  They went through\r\nthe country like the hoof-and-mouth disease, and killed the Indians off\r\nlike cattle.  You see, the Indians had lots of gold.  Well, what the\r\nSpaniards didn’t get, the surviving Indians hid away in that one big\r\nchunk on top the mountain, and it’s been waiting there ever since for\r\nme—and for you, if you want to go in on it.”\r\n\r\nAnd here, by the Lagoon of the Palace of Fine Arts, ended my acquaintance\r\nwith Julian Jones.  On my agreeing to finance the adventure, he promised\r\nto call on me at my hotel next morning with the letters of Seth Manners\r\nand the railroad, and conclude arrangements.  But he did not call.  That\r\nevening I telephoned his hotel and was informed by the clerk that Mr.\r\nJulian Jones and wife had departed in the early afternoon, with their\r\nbaggage.\r\n\r\nCan Mrs. Jones have rushed him back and hidden him away in Nebraska?  I\r\nremember that as we said good-bye, there was that in her smile that\r\nrecalled the vulpine complacency of Mona Lisa, the Wise.\r\n\r\n                                 THE END\r\n\r\nKohala, Hawaii,\r\n      _May_ 5, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIKE ARGUS OF THE ANCIENT TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was the summer of 1897, and there was trouble in the Tarwater family.\r\nGrandfather Tarwater, after remaining properly subdued and crushed for a\r\nquiet decade, had broken out again.  This time it was the Klondike fever.\r\nHis first and one unvarying symptom of such attacks was song.  One chant\r\nonly he raised, though he remembered no more than the first stanza and\r\nbut three lines of that.  And the family knew his feet were itching and\r\nhis brain was tingling with the old madness, when he lifted his\r\nhoarse-cracked voice, now falsetto-cracked, in:\r\n\r\n   Like Argus of the ancient times,\r\n      We leave this modern Greece,\r\n   Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum, tum, tum-tum,\r\n      To shear the Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\nTen years earlier he had lifted the chant, sung to the air of the\r\n“Doxology,” when afflicted with the fever to go gold-mining in Patagonia.\r\nThe multitudinous family had sat upon him, but had had a hard time doing\r\nit.  When all else had failed to shake his resolution, they had applied\r\nlawyers to him, with the threat of getting out guardianship papers and of\r\nconfining him in the state asylum for the insane—which was reasonable for\r\na man who had, a quarter of a century before, speculated away all but ten\r\nmeagre acres of a California principality, and who had displayed no\r\nbetter business acumen ever since.\r\n\r\nThe application of lawyers to John Tarwater was like the application of a\r\nmustard plaster.  For, in his judgment, they were the gentry, more than\r\nany other, who had skinned him out of the broad Tarwater acres.  So, at\r\nthe time of his Patagonian fever, the very thought of so drastic a remedy\r\nwas sufficient to cure him.  He quickly demonstrated he was not crazy by\r\nshaking the fever from him and agreeing not to go to Patagonia.\r\n\r\nNext, he demonstrated how crazy he really was, by deeding over to his\r\nfamily, unsolicited, the ten acres on Tarwater Flat, the house, barn,\r\noutbuildings, and water-rights.  Also did he turn over the eight hundred\r\ndollars in bank that was the long-saved salvage of his wrecked fortune.\r\nBut for this the family found no cause for committal to the asylum, since\r\nsuch committal would necessarily invalidate what he had done.\r\n\r\n“Grandfather is sure peeved,” said Mary, his oldest daughter, herself a\r\ngrandmother, when her father quit smoking.\r\n\r\nAll he had retained for himself was a span of old horses, a mountain\r\nbuckboard, and his one room in the crowded house.  Further, having\r\naffirmed that he would be beholden to none of them, he got the contract\r\nto carry the United States mail, twice a week, from Kelterville up over\r\nTarwater Mountain to Old Almaden—which was a sporadically worked\r\nquick-silver mine in the upland cattle country.  With his old horses it\r\ntook all his time to make the two weekly round trips.  And for ten years,\r\nrain or shine, he had never missed a trip.  Nor had he failed once to pay\r\nhis week’s board into Mary’s hand.  This board he had insisted on, in the\r\nconvalescence from his Patagonian fever, and he had paid it strictly,\r\nthough he had given up tobacco in order to be able to do it.\r\n\r\n“Huh!” he confided to the ruined water wheel of the old Tarwater Mill,\r\nwhich he had built from the standing timber and which had ground wheat\r\nfor the first settlers.  “Huh!  They’ll never put me in the poor farm so\r\nlong as I support myself.  And without a penny to my name it ain’t likely\r\nany lawyer fellows’ll come snoopin’ around after me.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet, precisely because of these highly rational acts, it was held\r\nthat John Tarwater was mildly crazy!\r\n\r\nThe first time he had lifted the chant of “Like Argus of the Ancient\r\nTimes,” had been in 1849, when, twenty-two years’ of age, violently\r\nattacked by the Californian fever, he had sold two hundred and forty\r\nMichigan acres, forty of it cleared, for the price of four yoke of oxen,\r\nand a wagon, and had started across the Plains.\r\n\r\n“And we turned off at Fort Hall, where the Oregon emigration went\r\nnorth’ard, and swung south for Californy,” was his way of concluding the\r\nnarrative of that arduous journey.  “And Bill Ping and me used to rope\r\ngrizzlies out of the underbrush of Cache Slough in the Sacramento\r\nValley.”\r\n\r\nYears of freighting and mining had followed, and, with a stake gleaned\r\nfrom the Merced placers, he satisfied the land-hunger of his race and\r\ntime by settling in Sonoma County.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years of carrying the mail across Tarwater Township, up\r\nTarwater Valley, and over Tarwater Mountain, most all of which land had\r\nonce been his, he had spent his time dreaming of winning back that land\r\nbefore he died.  And now, his huge gaunt form more erect than it had been\r\nfor years, with a glinting of blue fires in his small and close-set eyes,\r\nhe was lifting his ancient chant again.\r\n\r\n“There he goes now—listen to him,” said William Tarwater.\r\n\r\n“Nobody at home,” laughed Harris Topping, day labourer, husband of Annie\r\nTarwater, and father of her nine children.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen door opened to admit the old man, returning from feeding his\r\nhorses.  The song had ceased from his lips; but Mary was irritable from a\r\nburnt hand and a grandchild whose stomach refused to digest properly\r\ndiluted cows’ milk.\r\n\r\n“Now there ain’t no use you carryin’ on that way, father,” she tackled\r\nhim.  “The time’s past for you to cut and run for a place like the\r\nKlondike, and singing won’t buy you nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Just the same,” he answered quietly.  “I bet I could go to that Klondike\r\nplace and pick up enough gold to buy back the Tarwater lands.”\r\n\r\n“Old fool!” Annie contributed.\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t buy them back for less’n three hundred thousand and then\r\nsome,” was William’s effort at squelching him.\r\n\r\n“Then I could pick up three hundred thousand, and then some, if I was\r\nonly there,” the old man retorted placidly.\r\n\r\n“Thank God you can’t walk there, or you’d be startin’, I know,” Mary\r\ncried.  “Ocean travel costs money.”\r\n\r\n“I used to have money,” her father said humbly.\r\n\r\n“Well, you ain’t got any now—so forget it,” William advised.  “Them times\r\nis past, like roping bear with Bill Ping.  There ain’t no more bear.”\r\n\r\n“Just the same—”\r\n\r\nBut Mary cut him off.  Seizing the day’s paper from the kitchen table,\r\nshe flourished it savagely under her aged progenitor’s nose.\r\n\r\n“What do those Klondikers say?  There it is in cold print.  Only the\r\nyoung and robust can stand the Klondike.  It’s worse than the north pole.\r\nAnd they’ve left their dead a-plenty there themselves.  Look at their\r\npictures.  You’re forty years older ’n the oldest of them.”\r\n\r\nJohn Tarwater did look, but his eyes strayed to other photographs on the\r\nhighly sensational front page.\r\n\r\n“And look at the photys of them nuggets they brought down,” he said.  “I\r\nknow gold.  Didn’t I gopher twenty thousand outa the Merced?  And\r\nwouldn’t it a-ben a hundred thousand if that cloudburst hadn’t busted my\r\nwing-dam?  Now if I was only in the Klondike—”\r\n\r\n“Crazy as a loon,” William sneered in open aside to the rest.\r\n\r\n“A nice way to talk to your father,” Old Man Tarwater censured mildly.\r\n“My father’d have walloped the tar out of me with a single-tree if I’d\r\nspoke to him that way.”\r\n\r\n“But you _are_ crazy, father—” William began.\r\n\r\n“Reckon you’re right, son.  And that’s where my father wasn’t crazy.\r\nHe’d a-done it.”\r\n\r\n“The old man’s been reading some of them magazine articles about men who\r\nsucceeded after forty,” Annie jibed.\r\n\r\n“And why not, daughter?” he asked.  “And why can’t a man succeed after\r\nhe’s seventy?  I was only seventy this year.  And mebbe I could succeed\r\nif only I could get to the Klondike—”\r\n\r\n“Which you ain’t going to get to,” Mary shut him off.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, then,” he sighed, “seein’s I ain’t, I might just as well go to\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\nHe stood up, tall, gaunt, great-boned and gnarled, a splendid ruin of a\r\nman.  His ragged hair and whiskers were not grey but snowy white, as were\r\nthe tufts of hair that stood out on the backs of his huge bony fingers.\r\nHe moved toward the door, opened it, sighed, and paused with a backward\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“Just the same,” he murmured plaintively, “the bottoms of my feet is\r\nitching something terrible.”\r\n\r\nLong before the family stirred next morning, his horses fed and harnessed\r\nby lantern light, breakfast cooked and eaten by lamp fight, Old Man\r\nTarwater was off and away down Tarwater Valley on the road to\r\nKelterville.  Two things were unusual about this usual trip which he had\r\nmade a thousand and forty times since taking the mail contract.  He did\r\nnot drive to Kelterville, but turned off on the main road south to Santa\r\nRosa.  Even more remarkable than this was the paper-wrapped parcel\r\nbetween his feet.  It contained his one decent black suit, which Mary had\r\nbeen long reluctant to see him wear any more, not because it was shabby,\r\nbut because, as he guessed what was at the back of her mind, it was\r\ndecent enough to bury him in.\r\n\r\nAnd at Santa Rosa, in a second-hand clothes shop, he sold the suit\r\noutright for two dollars and a half.  From the same obliging shopman he\r\nreceived four dollars for the wedding ring of his long-dead wife.  The\r\nspan of horses and the wagon he disposed of for seventy-five dollars,\r\nalthough twenty-five was all he received down in cash.  Chancing to meet\r\nAlton Granger on the street, to whom never before had he mentioned the\r\nten dollars loaned him in ’74, he reminded Alton Granger of the little\r\naffair, and was promptly paid.  Also, of all unbelievable men to be in\r\nfunds, he so found the town drunkard for whom he had bought many a drink\r\nin the old and palmy days.  And from him John Tarwater borrowed a dollar.\r\nFinally, he took the afternoon train to San Francisco.\r\n\r\nA dozen days later, carrying a half-empty canvas sack of blankets and old\r\nclothes, he landed on the beach of Dyea in the thick of the great\r\nKlondike Rush.  The beach was screaming bedlam.  Ten thousand tons of\r\noutfit lay heaped and scattered, and twice ten thousand men struggled\r\nwith it and clamoured about it.  Freight, by Indian-back, over Chilcoot\r\nto Lake Linderman, had jumped from sixteen to thirty cents a pound, which\r\nlatter was a rate of six hundred dollars a ton.  And the sub-arctic\r\nwinter gloomed near at hand.  All knew it, and all knew that of the\r\ntwenty thousand of them very few would get across the passes, leaving the\r\nrest to winter and wait for the late spring thaw.\r\n\r\nSuch the beach old John Tarwater stepped upon; and straight across the\r\nbeach and up the trail toward Chilcoot he headed, cackling his ancient\r\nchant, a very Grandfather Argus himself, with no outfit worry in the\r\nworld, for he did not possess any outfit.  That night he slept on the\r\nflats, five miles above Dyea, at the head of canoe navigation.  Here the\r\nDyea River became a rushing mountain torrent, plunging out of a dark\r\ncanyon from the glaciers that fed it far above.\r\n\r\nAnd here, early next morning, he beheld a little man weighing no more\r\nthan a hundred, staggering along a foot-log under all of a hundred pounds\r\nof flour strapped on his back.  Also, he beheld the little man stumble\r\noff the log and fall face-downward in a quiet eddy where the water was\r\ntwo feet deep and proceed quietly to drown.  It was no desire of his to\r\ntake death so easily, but the flour on his back weighed as much as he and\r\nwould not let him up.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, old man,” he said to Tarwater, when the latter had dragged\r\nhim up into the air and ashore.\r\n\r\nWhile he unlaced his shoes and ran the water out, they had further talk.\r\nNext, he fished out a ten-dollar gold-piece and offered it to his\r\nrescuer.\r\n\r\nOld Tarwater shook his head and shivered, for the ice-water had wet him\r\nto his knees.\r\n\r\n“But I reckon I wouldn’t object to settin’ down to a friendly meal with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t had breakfast?” the little man, who was past forty and who had\r\nsaid his name was Anson, queried with a glance frankly curious.\r\n\r\n“Nary bite,” John Tarwater answered.\r\n\r\n“Where’s your outfit?  Ahead?”\r\n\r\n“Nary outfit.”\r\n\r\n“Expect to buy your grub on the Inside?”\r\n\r\n“Nary a dollar to buy it with, friend.  Which ain’t so important as a\r\nwarm bite of breakfast right now.”\r\n\r\nIn Anson’s camp, a quarter of a mile on, Tarwater found a slender,\r\nred-whiskered young man of thirty cursing over a fire of wet willow wood.\r\nIntroduced as Charles, he transferred his scowl and wrath to Tarwater,\r\nwho, genially oblivious, devoted himself to the fire, took advantage of\r\nthe chill morning breeze to create a draught which the other had left\r\nstupidly blocked by stones, and soon developed less smoke and more flame.\r\nThe third member of the party, Bill Wilson, or Big Bill as they called\r\nhim, came in with a hundred-and-forty-pound pack; and what Tarwater\r\nesteemed to be a very rotten breakfast was dished out by Charles.  The\r\nmush was half cooked and mostly burnt, the bacon was charred carbon, and\r\nthe coffee was unspeakable.\r\n\r\nImmediately the meal was wolfed down the three partners took their empty\r\npack-straps and headed down trail to where the remainder of their outfit\r\nlay at the last camp a mile away.  And old Tarwater became busy.  He\r\nwashed the dishes, foraged dry wood, mended a broken pack-strap, put an\r\nedge on the butcher-knife and camp-axe, and repacked the picks and\r\nshovels into a more carryable parcel.\r\n\r\nWhat had impressed him during the brief breakfast was the sort of awe in\r\nwhich Anson and Big Bill stood of Charles.  Once, during the morning,\r\nwhile Anson took a breathing spell after bringing in another\r\nhundred-pound pack, Tarwater delicately hinted his impression.\r\n\r\n“You see, it’s this way,” Anson said.  “We’ve divided our leadership.\r\nWe’ve got specialities.  Now I’m a carpenter.  When we get to Lake\r\nLinderman, and the trees are chopped and whipsawed into planks, I’ll boss\r\nthe building of the boat.  Big Bill is a logger and miner.  So he’ll boss\r\ngetting out the logs and all mining operations.  Most of our outfit’s\r\nahead.  We went broke paying the Indians to pack that much of it to the\r\ntop of Chilcoot.  Our last partner is up there with it, moving it along\r\nby himself down the other side.  His name’s Liverpool, and he’s a sailor.\r\nSo, when the boat’s built, he’s the boss of the outfit to navigate the\r\nlakes and rapids to Klondike.\r\n\r\n“And Charles—this Mr. Crayton—what might his speciality be?” Tarwater\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“He’s the business man.  When it comes to business and organization he’s\r\nboss.”\r\n\r\n“Hum,” Tarwater pondered.  “Very lucky to get such a bunch of\r\nspecialities into one outfit.”\r\n\r\n“More than luck,” Anson agreed.  “It was all accident, too.  Each of us\r\nstarted alone.  We met on the steamer coming up from San Francisco, and\r\nformed the party.—Well, I got to be goin’.  Charles is liable to get\r\nkicking because I ain’t packin’ my share’ just the same, you can’t expect\r\na hundred-pound man to pack as much as a hundred-and-sixty-pounder.”\r\n\r\n“Stick around and cook us something for dinner,” Charles, on his next\r\nload in and noting the effects of the old man’s handiness, told Tarwater.\r\n\r\nAnd Tarwater cooked a dinner that was a dinner, washed the dishes, had\r\nreal pork and beans for supper, and bread baked in a frying-pan that was\r\nso delectable that the three partners nearly foundered themselves on it.\r\nSupper dishes washed, he cut shavings and kindling for a quick and\r\ncertain breakfast fire, showed Anson a trick with foot-gear that was\r\ninvaluable to any hiker, sang his “Like Argus of the Ancient Times,” and\r\ntold them of the great emigration across the Plains in Forty-nine.\r\n\r\n“My goodness, the first cheerful and hearty-like camp since we hit the\r\nbeach,” Big Bill remarked as he knocked out his pipe and began pulling\r\noff his shoes for bed.\r\n\r\n“Kind of made things easy, boys, eh?”  Tarwater queried genially.\r\n\r\nAll nodded.  “Well, then, I got a proposition, boys.  You can take it or\r\nleave it, but just listen kindly to it.  You’re in a hurry to get in\r\nbefore the freeze-up.  Half the time is wasted over the cooking by one of\r\nyou that he might be puttin’ in packin’ outfit.  If I do the cookin’ for\r\nyou, you all’ll get on that much faster.  Also, the cookin’ ’ll be\r\nbetter, and that’ll make you pack better.  And I can pack quite a bit\r\nmyself in between times, quite a bit, yes, sir, quite a bit.”\r\n\r\nBig Bill and Anson were just beginning to nod their heads in agreement,\r\nwhen Charles stopped them.\r\n\r\n“What do you expect of us in return?” he demanded of the old man.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I leave it up to the boys.”\r\n\r\n“That ain’t business,” Charles reprimanded sharply.  “You made the\r\nproposition.  Now finish it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s this way—”\r\n\r\n“You expect us to feed you all winter, eh?” Charles interrupted.\r\n\r\n“No, siree, I don’t.  All I reckon is a passage to Klondike in your boat\r\nwould be mighty square of you.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t an ounce of grub, old man.  You’ll starve to death when you\r\nget there.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been feedin’ some long time pretty successful,” Old Tarwater\r\nreplied, a whimsical light in his eyes.  “I’m seventy, and ain’t starved\r\nto death never yet.”\r\n\r\n“Will you sign a paper to the effect that you shift for yourself as soon\r\nas you get to Dawson?” the business one demanded.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sure,” was the response.\r\n\r\nAgain Charles checked his two partners’ expressions of satisfaction with\r\nthe arrangement.\r\n\r\n“One other thing, old man.  We’re a party of four, and we all have a vote\r\non questions like this.  Young Liverpool is ahead with the main outfit.\r\nHe’s got a say so, and he isn’t here to say it.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of a party might he be?” Tarwater inquired.\r\n\r\n“He’s a rough-neck sailor, and he’s got a quick, bad temper.”\r\n\r\n“Some turbulent,” Anson contributed.\r\n\r\n“And the way he can cuss is simply God-awful,” Big Bill testified.\r\n\r\n“But he’s square,” Big Bill added.\r\n\r\nAnson nodded heartily to this appraisal.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” Tarwater summed up, “I set out for Californy and I got\r\nthere.  And I’m going to get to Klondike.  Ain’t a thing can stop me,\r\nain’t a thing.  I’m going to get three hundred thousand outa the ground,\r\ntoo.  Ain’t a thing can stop me, ain’t a thing, because I just naturally\r\nneed the money.  I don’t mind a bad temper so long’s the boy is square.\r\nI’ll take my chance, an’ I’ll work along with you till we catch up with\r\nhim.  Then, if he says no to the proposition, I reckon I’ll lose.  But\r\nsomehow I just can’t see ’m sayin’ no, because that’d mean too close up\r\nto freeze-up and too late for me to find another chance like this.  And,\r\nas I’m sure going to get to Klondike, it’s just plumb impossible for him\r\nto say no.”\r\n\r\nOld John Tarwater became a striking figure on a trail unusually replete\r\nwith striking figures.  With thousands of men, each back-tripping half a\r\nton of outfit, retracing every mile of the trail twenty times, all came\r\nto know him and to hail him as “Father Christmas.”  And, as he worked,\r\never he raised his chant with his age-falsetto voice.  None of the three\r\nmen he had joined could complain about his work.  True, his joints were\r\nstiff—he admitted to a trifle of rheumatism.  He moved slowly, and seemed\r\nto creak and crackle when he moved; but he kept on moving.  Last into the\r\nblankets at night, he was first out in the morning, so that the other\r\nthree had hot coffee before their one before-breakfast pack.  And,\r\nbetween breakfast and dinner and between dinner and supper, he always\r\nmanaged to back-trip for several packs himself.  Sixty pounds was the\r\nlimit of his burden, however.  He could manage seventy-five, but he could\r\nnot keep it up.  Once, he tried ninety, but collapsed on the trail and\r\nwas seriously shaky for a couple of days afterward.\r\n\r\nWork!  On a trail where hard-working men learned for the first time what\r\nwork was, no man worked harder in proportion to his strength than Old\r\nTarwater.  Driven desperately on by the near-thrust of winter, and lured\r\nmadly on by the dream of gold, they worked to their last ounce of\r\nstrength and fell by the way.  Others, when failure made certain, blew\r\nout their brains.  Some went mad, and still others, under the irk of the\r\nman-destroying strain, broke partnerships and dissolved life-time\r\nfriendships with fellows just as good as themselves and just as strained\r\nand mad.\r\n\r\nWork!  Old Tarwater could shame them all, despite his creaking and\r\ncrackling and the nasty hacking cough he had developed.  Early and late,\r\non trail or in camp beside the trail he was ever in evidence, ever busy\r\nat something, ever responsive to the hail of “Father Christmas.”  Weary\r\nback-trippers would rest their packs on a log or rock alongside of where\r\nhe rested his, and would say: “Sing us that song of yourn, dad, about\r\nForty-Nine.”  And, when he had wheezingly complied, they would arise\r\nunder their loads, remark that it was real heartening, and hit the\r\nforward trail again.\r\n\r\n“If ever a man worked his passage and earned it,” Big Bill confided to\r\nhis two partners, “that man’s our old Skeezicks.”\r\n\r\n“You bet,” Anson confirmed.  “He’s a valuable addition to the party, and\r\nI, for one, ain’t at all disagreeable to the notion of making him a\r\nregular partner—”\r\n\r\n“None of that!” Charles Crayton cut in.  “When we get to Dawson we’re\r\nquit of him—that’s the agreement.  We’d only have to bury him if we let\r\nhim stay on with us.  Besides, there’s going to be a famine, and every\r\nounce of grub’ll count.  Remember, we’re feeding him out of our own\r\nsupply all the way in.  And if we run short in the pinch next year,\r\nyou’ll know the reason.  Steamboats can’t get up grub to Dawson till the\r\nmiddle of June, and that’s nine months away.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you put as much money and outfit in as the rest of us,” Big Bill\r\nconceded, “and you’ve a say according.”\r\n\r\n“And I’m going to have my say,” Charles asserted with increasing\r\nirritability.  “And it’s lucky for you with your fool sentiments that\r\nyou’ve got somebody to think ahead for you, else you’d all starve to\r\ndeath.  I tell you that famine’s coming.  I’ve been studying the\r\nsituation.  Flour will be two dollars a pound, or ten, and no sellers.\r\nYou mark my words.”\r\n\r\nAcross the rubble-covered flats, up the dark canyon to Sheep Camp, past\r\nthe over-hanging and ever-threatening glaciers to the Scales, and from\r\nthe Scales up the steep pitches of ice-scoured rock where packers climbed\r\nwith hands and feet, Old Tarwater camp-cooked and packed and sang.  He\r\nblew across Chilcoot Pass, above timberline, in the first swirl of autumn\r\nsnow.  Those below, without firewood, on the bitter rim of Crater Lake,\r\nheard from the driving obscurity above them a weird voice chanting:\r\n\r\n   “Like Argus of the ancient times,\r\n      We leave this modern Greece,\r\n   Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum, tum, tum-tum,\r\n      To shear the Golden Fleece.”\r\n\r\nAnd out of the snow flurries they saw appear a tall, gaunt form, with\r\nwhiskers of flying white that blended with the storm, bending under a\r\nsixty-pound pack of camp dunnage.\r\n\r\n“Father Christmas!” was the hail.  And then: “Three rousing cheers for\r\nFather Christmas!”\r\n\r\nTwo miles beyond Crater Lake lay Happy Camp—so named because here was\r\nfound the uppermost fringe of the timber line, where men might warm\r\nthemselves by fire again.  Scarcely could it be called timber, for it was\r\na dwarf rock-spruce that never raised its loftiest branches higher than a\r\nfoot above the moss, and that twisted and grovelled like a pig-vegetable\r\nunder the moss.  Here, on the trail leading into Happy Camp, in the first\r\nsunshine of half a dozen days, Old Tarwater rested his pack against a\r\nhuge boulder and caught his breath.  Around this boulder the trail\r\npassed, laden men toiling slowly forward and men with empty pack-straps\r\nlimping rapidly back for fresh loads.  Twice Old Tarwater essayed to rise\r\nand go on, and each time, warned by his shakiness, sank back to recover\r\nmore strength.  From around the boulder he heard voices in greeting,\r\nrecognized Charles Crayton’s voice, and realized that at last they had\r\nmet up with Young Liverpool.  Quickly, Charles plunged into business, and\r\nTarwater heard with great distinctness every word of Charles’\r\nunflattering description of him and the proposition to give him passage\r\nto Dawson.\r\n\r\n“A dam fool proposition,” was Liverpool’s judgment, when Charles had\r\nconcluded.  “An old granddad of seventy!  If he’s on his last legs, why\r\nin hell did you hook up with him?  If there’s going to be a famine, and\r\nit looks like it, we need every ounce of grub for ourselves.  We only\r\nout-fitted for four, not five.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” Tarwater heard Charles assuring the other.  “Don’t get\r\nexcited.  The old codger agreed to leave the final decision to you when\r\nwe caught up with you.  All you’ve got to do is put your foot down and\r\nsay no.”\r\n\r\n“You mean it’s up to me to turn the old one down, after your encouraging\r\nhim and taking advantage of his work clear from Dyea here?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a hard trail, Liverpool, and only the men that are hard will get\r\nthrough,” Charles strove to palliate.\r\n\r\n“And I’m to do the dirty work?” Liverpool complained, while Tarwater’s\r\nheart sank.\r\n\r\n“That’s just about the size of it,” Charles said.  “You’ve got the\r\ndeciding.”\r\n\r\nThen old Tarwater’s heart uprose again as the air was rent by a cyclone\r\nof profanity, from the midst of which crackled sentences like:—“Dirty\r\nskunks! . . . See you in hell first! . . . My mind’s made up! . . .\r\nHell’s fire and corruption! . . . The old codger goes down the Yukon with\r\nus, stack on that, my hearty! . . . Hard?  You don’t know what hard is\r\nunless I show you! . . . I’ll bust the whole outfit to hell and gone if\r\nany of you try to side-track him! . . . Just try to side-track him, that\r\nis all, and you’ll think the Day of Judgment and all God’s blastingness\r\nhas hit the camp in one chunk!”\r\n\r\nSuch was the invigoratingness of Liverpool’s flow of speech that, quite\r\nwithout consciousness of effort, the old man arose easily under his load\r\nand strode on toward Happy Camp.\r\n\r\nFrom Happy Camp to Long Lake, from Long Lake to Deep Lake, and from Deep\r\nLake up over the enormous hog-back and down to Linderman, the man-killing\r\nrace against winter kept on.  Men broke their hearts and backs and wept\r\nbeside the trail in sheer exhaustion.  But winter never faltered.  The\r\nfall gales blew, and amid bitter soaking rains and ever-increasing snow\r\nflurries, Tarwater and the party to which he was attached piled the last\r\nof their outfit on the beach.\r\n\r\nThere was no rest.  Across the lake, a mile above a roaring torrent, they\r\nlocated a patch of spruce and built their saw-pit.  Here, by hand, with\r\nan inadequate whipsaw, they sawed the spruce-trunks into lumber.  They\r\nworked night and day.  Thrice, on the night-shift, underneath in the\r\nsaw-pit, Old Tarwater fainted.  By day he cooked as well, and, in the\r\nbetweenwhiles, helped Anson in the building of the boat beside the\r\ntorrent as the green planks came down.\r\n\r\nThe days grew shorter.  The wind shifted into the north and blew unending\r\ngales.  In the mornings the weary men crawled from their blankets and in\r\ntheir socks thawed out their frozen shoes by the fire Tarwater always had\r\nburning for them.  Ever arose the increasing tale of famine on the\r\nInside.  The last grub steamboats up from Bering Sea were stalled by low\r\nwater at the beginning of the Yukon Flats hundreds of miles north of\r\nDawson.  In fact, they lay at the old Hudson Bay Company’s post at Fort\r\nYukon inside the Arctic Circle.  Flour in Dawson was up to two dollars a\r\npound, but no one would sell.  Bonanza and Eldorado Kings, with money to\r\nburn, were leaving for the Outside because they could buy no grub.\r\nMiners’ Committees were confiscating all grub and putting the population\r\non strict rations.  A man who held out an ounce of grub was shot like a\r\ndog.  A score had been so executed already.\r\n\r\nAnd, under a strain which had broken so many younger men, Old Tarwater\r\nbegan to break.  His cough had become terrible, and had not his exhausted\r\ncomrades slept like the dead, he would have kept them awake nights.\r\nAlso, he began to take chills, so that he dressed up to go to bed.  When\r\nhe had finished so dressing, not a rag of garment remained in his clothes\r\nbag.  All he possessed was on his back and swathed around his gaunt old\r\nform.\r\n\r\n“Gee!” said Big Bill.  “If he puts all he’s got on now, when it ain’t\r\nlower than twenty above, what’ll he do later on when it goes down to\r\nfifty and sixty below?”\r\n\r\nThey lined the rough-made boat down the mountain torrent, nearly losing\r\nit a dozen times, and rowed across the south end of Lake Linderman in the\r\nthick of a fall blizzard.  Next morning they planned to load and start,\r\nsquarely into the teeth of the north, on their perilous traverse of half\r\na thousand miles of lakes and rapids and box canyons.  But before he went\r\nto bed that night, Young Liverpool was out over the camp.  He returned to\r\nfind his whole party asleep.  Rousing Tarwater, he talked with him in low\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n“Listen, dad,” he said.—“You’ve got a passage in our boat, and if ever a\r\nman earned a passage you have.  But you know yourself you’re pretty well\r\nalong in years, and your health right now ain’t exciting.  If you go on\r\nwith us you’ll croak surer’n hell.—Now wait till I finish, dad.  The\r\nprice for a passage has jumped to five hundred dollars.  I’ve been\r\nthrowing my feet and I’ve hustled a passenger.  He’s an official of the\r\nAlaska Commercial and just has to get in.  He’s bid up to six hundred to\r\ngo with me in our boat.  Now the passage is yours.  You sell it to him,\r\npoke the six hundred into your jeans, and pull South for California while\r\nthe goin’s good.  You can be in Dyea in two days, and in California in a\r\nweek more.  What d’ye say?”\r\n\r\nTarwater coughed and shivered for a space, ere he could get freedom of\r\nbreath for speech.\r\n\r\n“Son,” he said, “I just want to tell you one thing.  I drove my four yoke\r\nof oxen across the Plains in Forty-nine and lost nary a one.  I drove\r\nthem plumb to Californy, and I freighted with them afterward out of\r\nSutter’s Fort to American Bar.  Now I’m going to Klondike.  Ain’t nothing\r\ncan stop me, ain’t nothing at all.  I’m going to ride that boat, with you\r\nat the steering sweep, clean to Klondike, and I’m going to shake three\r\nhundred thousand out of the moss-roots.  That being so, it’s contrary to\r\nreason and common sense for me to sell out my passage.  But I thank you\r\nkindly, son, I thank you kindly.”\r\n\r\nThe young sailor shot out his hand impulsively and gripped the old man’s.\r\n\r\n“By God, dad!” he cried.  “You’re sure going to go then.  You’re the real\r\nstuff.”  He looked with undisguised contempt across the sleepers to where\r\nCharles Crayton snored in his red beard.  “They don’t seem to make your\r\nkind any more, dad.”\r\n\r\nInto the north they fought their way, although old-timers, coming out,\r\nshook their heads and prophesied they would be frozen in on the lakes.\r\nThat the freeze-up might come any day was patent, and delays of safety\r\nwere no longer considered.  For this reason, Liverpool decided to shoot\r\nthe rapid stream connecting Linderman to Lake Bennett with the fully\r\nloaded boat.  It was the custom to line the empty boats down and to\r\nportage the cargoes across.  Even then many empty boats had been wrecked.\r\nBut the time was past for such precaution.\r\n\r\n“Climb out, dad,” Liverpool commanded as he prepared to swing from the\r\nbank and enter the rapids.\r\n\r\nOld Tarwater shook his white head.\r\n\r\n“I’m sticking to the outfit,” he declared.  “It’s the only way to get\r\nthrough.  You see, son, I’m going to Klondike.  If I stick by the boat,\r\nthen the boat just naturally goes to Klondike, too.  If I get out, then\r\nmost likely you’ll lose the boat.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s no use in overloading,” Charles announced, springing\r\nabruptly out on the bank as the boat cast off.\r\n\r\n“Next time you wait for my orders!” Liverpool shouted ashore as the\r\ncurrent gripped the boat.  “And there won’t be any more walking around\r\nrapids and losing time waiting to pick you up!”\r\n\r\nWhat took them ten minutes by river, took Charles half an hour by land,\r\nand while they waited for him at the head of Lake Bennett they passed the\r\ntime of day with several dilapidated old-timers on their way out.  The\r\nfamine news was graver than ever.  The North-west Mounted Police,\r\nstationed at the foot of Lake Marsh where the gold-rushers entered\r\nCanadian territory, were refusing to let a man past who did not carry\r\nwith him seven hundred pounds of grub.  In Dawson City a thousand men,\r\nwith dog-teams, were waiting the freeze-up to come out over the ice.  The\r\ntrading companies could not fill their grub-contracts, and partners were\r\ncutting the cards to see which should go and which should stay and work\r\nthe claims.\r\n\r\n“That settles it,” Charles announced, when he learned of the action of\r\nthe mounted police on the boundary.  “Old Man, you might as well start\r\nback now.”\r\n\r\n“Climb aboard!”  Liverpool commanded.  “We’re going to Klondike, and old\r\ndad is going along.”\r\n\r\nA shift of gale to the south gave them a fair wind down Lake Bennett,\r\nbefore which they ran under a huge sail made by Liverpool.  The heavy\r\nweight of outfit gave such ballast that he cracked on as a daring sailor\r\nshould when moments counted.  A shift of four points into the south-west,\r\ncoming just at the right time as they entered upon Caribou Crossing,\r\ndrove them down that connecting link to lakes Tagish and Marsh.  In\r\nstormy sunset and twilight—they made the dangerous crossing of Great\r\nWindy Arm, wherein they beheld two other boat-loads of gold-rushers\r\ncapsize and drown.\r\n\r\nCharles was for beaching for the night, but Liverpool held on, steering\r\ndown Tagish by the sound of the surf on the shoals and by the occasional\r\nshore-fires that advertised wrecked or timid argonauts.  At four in the\r\nmorning, he aroused Charles.  Old Tarwater, shiveringly awake, heard\r\nLiverpool order Crayton aft beside him at the steering-sweep, and also\r\nheard the one-sided conversation.\r\n\r\n“Just listen, friend Charles, and keep your own mouth shut,” Liverpool\r\nbegan.  “I want you to get one thing into your head and keep it there:\r\n_old dad’s going by the police_.  _Understand_?  _He’s going by_.  When\r\nthey examine our outfit, old dad’s got a fifth share in it, savvee?\r\nThat’ll put us all ’way under what we ought to have, but we can bluff it\r\nthrough.  Now get this, and get it hard: _there ain’t going to be any\r\nfall-down on this bluff_—”\r\n\r\n“If you think I’d give away on the old codger—” Charles began\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n“You thought that,” Liverpool checked him, “because I never mentioned any\r\nsuch thing.  Now—get me and get me hard: I don’t care what you’ve been\r\nthinking.  It’s what you’re going to think.  We’ll make the police post\r\nsome time this afternoon, and we’ve got to get ready to pull the bluff\r\nwithout a hitch, and a word to the wise is plenty.”\r\n\r\n“If you think I’ve got it in my mind—” Charles began again.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” Liverpool shut him off.  “I don’t know what’s in your mind.\r\nI don’t want to know.  I want you to know what’s in my mind.  If there’s\r\nany slip-up, if old dad gets turned back by the police, I’m going to pick\r\nout the first quiet bit of landscape and take you ashore on it.  And then\r\nI’m going to beat you up to the Queen’s taste.  Get me, and get me hard.\r\nIt ain’t going to be any half-way beating, but a real, two-legged,\r\ntwo-fisted, he-man beating.  I don’t expect I’ll kill you, but I’ll come\r\ndamn near to half-killing you.”\r\n\r\n“But what can I do?” Charles almost whimpered.\r\n\r\n“Just one thing,” was Liverpool’s final word.  “You just pray.  You pray\r\nso hard that old dad gets by the police that he does get by.  That’s all.\r\nGo back to your blankets.”\r\n\r\nBefore they gained Lake Le Barge, the land was sheeted with snow that\r\nwould not melt for half a year.  Nor could they lay their boat at will\r\nagainst the bank, for the rim-ice was already forming.  Inside the mouth\r\nof the river, just ere it entered Lake Le Barge, they found a hundred\r\nstorm-bound boats of the argonauts.  Out of the north, across the full\r\nsweep of the great lake, blew an unending snow gale.  Three mornings they\r\nput out and fought it and the cresting seas it drove that turned to ice\r\nas they fell in-board.  While the others broke their hearts at the oars,\r\nOld Tarwater managed to keep up just sufficient circulation to survive by\r\nchopping ice and throwing it overboard.\r\n\r\nEach day for three days, beaten to helplessness, they turned tail on the\r\nbattle and ran back into the sheltering river.  By the fourth day, the\r\nhundred boats had increased to three hundred, and the two thousand\r\nargonauts on board knew that the great gale heralded the freeze-up of Le\r\nBarge.  Beyond, the rapid rivers would continue to run for days, but\r\nunless they got beyond, and immediately, they were doomed to be frozen in\r\nfor six months to come.\r\n\r\n“This day we go through,” Liverpool announced.  “We turn back for\r\nnothing.  And those of us that dies at the oars will live again and go on\r\npulling.”\r\n\r\nAnd they went through, winning half the length of the lake by nightfall\r\nand pulling on through all the night hours as the wind went down, falling\r\nasleep at the oars and being rapped awake by Liverpool, toiling on\r\nthrough an age-long nightmare while the stars came out and the surface of\r\nthe lake turned to the unruffledness of a sheet of paper and froze\r\nskin-ice that tinkled like broken glass as their oar-blades shattered it.\r\n\r\nAs day broke clear and cold, they entered the river, with behind them a\r\nsea of ice.  Liverpool examined his aged passenger and found him helpless\r\nand almost gone.  When he rounded the boat to against the rim-ice to\r\nbuild a fire and warm up Tarwater inside and out, Charles protested\r\nagainst such loss of time.\r\n\r\n“This ain’t business, so don’t you come horning in,” Liverpool informed\r\nhim.  “I’m running the boat trip.  So you just climb out and chop\r\nfirewood, and plenty of it.  I’ll take care of dad.  You, Anson, make a\r\nfire on the bank.  And you, Bill, set up the Yukon stove in the boat.\r\nOld dad ain’t as young as the rest of us, and for the rest of this voyage\r\nhe’s going to have a fire on board to sit by.”\r\n\r\nAll of which came to pass; and the boat, in the grip of the current, like\r\na river steamer with smoke rising from the two joints of stove-pipe,\r\ngrounded on shoals, hung up on split currents, and charged rapids and\r\ncanyons, as it drove deeper into the Northland winter.  The Big and\r\nLittle Salmon rivers were throwing mush-ice into the main river as they\r\npassed, and, below the riffles, anchor-ice arose from the river bottom\r\nand coated the surface with crystal scum.  Night and day the rim-ice\r\ngrew, till, in quiet places, it extended out a hundred yards from shore.\r\nAnd Old Tarwater, with all his clothes on, sat by the stove and kept the\r\nfire going.  Night and day, not daring to stop for fear of the imminent\r\nfreeze-up, they dared to run, an increasing mushiness of ice running with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“What ho, old hearty?” Liverpool would call out at times.\r\n\r\n“Cheer O,” Old Tarwater had learned to respond.\r\n\r\n“What can I ever do for you, son, in payment?” Tarwater, stoking the\r\nfire, would sometimes ask Liverpool, beating now one released hand and\r\nnow the other as he fought for circulation where he steered in the\r\nfreezing stern-sheets.\r\n\r\n“Just break out that regular song of yours, old Forty-Niner,” was the\r\ninvariable reply.\r\n\r\nAnd Tarwater would lift his voice in the cackling chant, as he lifted it\r\nat the end, when the boat swung in through driving cake-ice and moored to\r\nthe Dawson City bank, and all waterfront Dawson pricked its ears to hear\r\nthe triumphant pæan:\r\n\r\n   Like Argus of the ancient times,\r\n      We leave this modern Greece,\r\n   Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum, tum, tum-tum,\r\n      To shear the Golden Fleece,\r\n\r\nCharles did it, but he did it so discreetly that none of his party, least\r\nof all the sailor, ever learned of it.  He saw two great open barges\r\nbeing filled up with men, and, on inquiry, learned that these were\r\ngrubless ones being rounded up and sent down the Yukon by the Committee\r\nof Safety.  The barges were to be towed by the last little steamboat in\r\nDawson, and the hope was that Fort Yukon, where lay the stranded\r\nsteamboats, would be gained before the river froze.  At any rate, no\r\nmatter what happened to them, Dawson would be relieved of their\r\ngrub-consuming presence.  So to the Committee of Safety Charles went,\r\nprivily to drop a flea in its ear concerning Tarwater’s grubless,\r\nmoneyless, and aged condition.  Tarwater was one of the last gathered in,\r\nand when Young Liverpool returned to the boat, from the bank he saw the\r\nbarges in a run of cake-ice, disappearing around the bend below\r\nMoose-hide Mountain.\r\n\r\nRunning in cake-ice all the way, and several times escaping jams in the\r\nYukon Flats, the barges made their hundreds of miles of progress farther\r\ninto the north and froze up cheek by jowl with the grub-fleet.  Here,\r\ninside the Arctic Circle, Old Tarwater settled down to pass the long\r\nwinter.  Several hours’ work a day, chopping firewood for the steamboat\r\ncompanies, sufficed to keep him in food.  For the rest of the time there\r\nwas nothing to do but hibernate in his log cabin.\r\n\r\nWarmth, rest, and plenty to eat, cured his hacking cough and put him in\r\nas good physical condition as was possible for his advanced years.  But,\r\neven before Christmas, the lack of fresh vegetables caused scurvy to\r\nbreak out, and disappointed adventurer after disappointed adventurer took\r\nto his bunk in abject surrender to this culminating misfortune.  Not so\r\nTarwater.  Even before the first symptoms appeared on him, he was putting\r\ninto practice his one prescription, namely, exercise.  From the junk of\r\nthe old trading post he resurrected a number of rusty traps, and from one\r\nof the steamboat captains he borrowed a rifle.\r\n\r\nThus equipped, he ceased from wood-chopping, and began to make more than\r\na mere living.  Nor was he downhearted when the scurvy broke out on his\r\nown body.  Ever he ran his trap-lines and sang his ancient chant.  Nor\r\ncould the pessimist shake his surety of the three hundred thousand of\r\nAlaskan gold he as going to shake out of the moss-roots.\r\n\r\n“But this ain’t gold-country,” they told him.\r\n\r\n“Gold is where you find it, son, as I should know who was mining before\r\nyou was born, ’way back in Forty-Nine,” was his reply.  “What was Bonanza\r\nCreek but a moose-pasture?  No miner’d look at it; yet they washed\r\nfive-hundred-dollar pans and took out fifty million dollars.  Eldorado\r\nwas just as bad.  For all you know, right under this here cabin, or right\r\nover the next hill, is millions just waiting for a lucky one like me to\r\ncome and shake it out.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of January came his disaster.  Some powerful animal that he\r\ndecided was a bob-cat, managing to get caught in one of his smaller\r\ntraps, dragged it away.  A heavy snow-fall put a stop midway to his\r\npursuit, losing the trail for him and losing himself.  There were but\r\nseveral hours of daylight each day between the twenty hours of\r\nintervening darkness, and his efforts in the grey light and continually\r\nfalling snow succeeded only in losing him more thoroughly.  Fortunately,\r\nwhen winter snow falls in the Northland the thermometer invariably rises;\r\nso, instead of the customary forty and fifty and even sixty degrees below\r\nzero, the temperature remained fifteen below.  Also, he was warmly clad\r\nand had a full matchbox.  Further to mitigate his predicament, on the\r\nfifth day he killed a wounded moose that weighed over half a ton.  Making\r\nhis camp beside it on a spruce-bottom, he was prepared to last out the\r\nwinter, unless a searching party found him or his scurvy grew worse.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of two weeks there had been no sign of search, while his\r\nscurvy had undeniably grown worse.  Against his fire, banked from outer\r\ncold by a shelter-wall of spruce-boughs, he crouched long hours in sleep\r\nand long hours in waking.  But the waking hours grew less, becoming\r\nsemi-waking or half-dreaming hours as the process of hibernation worked\r\ntheir way with him.  Slowly the sparkle point of consciousness and\r\nidentity that was John Tarwater sank, deeper and deeper, into the\r\nprofounds of his being that had been compounded ere man was man, and\r\nwhile he was becoming man, when he, first of all animals, regarded\r\nhimself with an introspective eye and laid the beginnings of morality in\r\nfoundations of nightmare peopled by the monsters of his own\r\nethic-thwarted desires.\r\n\r\nLike a man in fever, waking to intervals of consciousness, so Old\r\nTarwater awoke, cooked his moose-meat, and fed the fire; but more and\r\nmore time he spent in his torpor, unaware of what was day-dream and what\r\nwas sleep-dream in the content of his unconsciousness.  And here, in the\r\nunforgetable crypts of man’s unwritten history, unthinkable and\r\nunrealizable, like passages of nightmare or impossible adventures of\r\nlunacy, he encountered the monsters created of man’s first morality that\r\never since have vexed him into the spinning of fantasies to elude them or\r\ndo battle with them.\r\n\r\nIn short, weighted by his seventy years, in the vast and silent\r\nloneliness of the North, Old Tarwater, as in the delirium of drug or\r\nanæsthetic, recovered within himself, the infantile mind of the child-man\r\nof the early world.  It was in the dusk of Death’s fluttery wings that\r\nTarwater thus crouched, and, like his remote forebear, the child-man,\r\nwent to myth-making, and sun-heroizing, himself hero-maker and the hero\r\nin quest of the immemorable treasure difficult of attainment.\r\n\r\nEither must he attain the treasure—for so ran the inexorable logic of the\r\nshadow-land of the unconscious—or else sink into the all-devouring sea,\r\nthe blackness eater of the light that swallowed to extinction the sun\r\neach night . . . the sun that arose ever in rebirth next morning in the\r\neast, and that had become to man man’s first symbol of immortality\r\nthrough rebirth.  All this, in the deeps of his unconsciousness (the\r\nshadowy western land of descending light), was the near dusk of Death\r\ndown into which he slowly ebbed.\r\n\r\nBut how to escape this monster of the dark that from within him slowly\r\nswallowed him?  Too deep-sunk was he to dream of escape or feel the prod\r\nof desire to escape.  For him reality had ceased.  Nor from within the\r\ndarkened chamber of himself could reality recrudesce.  His years were too\r\nheavy upon him, the debility of disease and the lethargy and torpor of\r\nthe silence and the cold were too profound.  Only from without could\r\nreality impact upon him and reawake within him an awareness of reality.\r\nOtherwise he would ooze down through the shadow-realm of the unconscious\r\ninto the all-darkness of extinction.\r\n\r\nBut it came, the smash of reality from without, crashing upon his ear\r\ndrums in a loud, explosive snort.  For twenty days, in a temperature that\r\nhad never risen above fifty below, no breath of wind had blown movement,\r\nno slightest sound had broken the silence.  Like the smoker on the opium\r\ncouch refocusing his eyes from the spacious walls of dream to the narrow\r\nconfines of the mean little room, so Old Tarwater stared vague-eyed\r\nbefore him across his dying fire, at a huge moose that stared at him in\r\nstartlement, dragging a wounded leg, manifesting all signs of extreme\r\nexhaustion; it, too, had been straying blindly in the shadow-land, and\r\nhad wakened to reality only just ere it stepped into Tarwater’s fire.\r\n\r\nHe feebly slipped the large fur mitten lined with thickness of wool from\r\nhis right hand.  Upon trial he found the trigger finger too numb for\r\nmovement.  Carefully, slowly, through long minutes, he worked the bare\r\nhand inside his blankets, up under his fur _parka_, through the chest\r\nopenings of his shirts, and into the slightly warm hollow of his left\r\narm-pit.  Long minutes passed ere the finger could move, when, with equal\r\nslowness of caution, he gathered his rifle to his shoulder and drew bead\r\nupon the great animal across the fire.\r\n\r\nAt the shot, of the two shadow-wanderers, the one reeled downward to the\r\ndark and the other reeled upward to the light, swaying drunkenly on his\r\nscurvy-ravaged legs, shivering with nervousness and cold, rubbing\r\nswimming eyes with shaking fingers, and staring at the real world all\r\nabout him that had returned to him with such sickening suddenness.  He\r\nshook himself together, and realized that for long, how long he did not\r\nknow, he had bedded in the arms of Death.  He spat, with definite\r\nintention, heard the spittle crackle in the frost, and judged it must be\r\nbelow and far below sixty below.  In truth, that day at Fort Yukon, the\r\nspirit thermometer registered seventy-five degrees below zero, which,\r\nsince freezing-point is thirty-two above, was equivalent to one hundred\r\nand seven degrees of frost.\r\n\r\nSlowly Tarwater’s brain reasoned to action.  Here, in the vast alone,\r\ndwelt Death.  Here had come two wounded moose.  With the clearing of the\r\nsky after the great cold came on, he had located his bearings, and he\r\nknew that both wounded moose had trailed to him from the east.\r\nTherefore, in the east, were men—whites or Indians he could not tell, but\r\nat any rate men who might stand by him in his need and help moor him to\r\nreality above the sea of dark.\r\n\r\nHe moved slowly, but he moved in reality, girding himself with rifle,\r\nammunition, matches, and a pack of twenty pounds of moose-meat.  Then, an\r\nArgus rejuvenated, albeit lame of both legs and tottery, he turned his\r\nback on the perilous west and limped into the sun-arising, re-birthing\r\neast. . . .\r\n\r\nDays later—how many days later he was never to know—dreaming dreams and\r\nseeing visions, cackling his old gold-chant of Forty-Nine, like one\r\ndrowning and swimming feebly to keep his consciousness above the\r\nengulfing dark, he came out upon the snow-slope to a canyon and saw below\r\nsmoke rising and men who ceased from work to gaze at him.  He tottered\r\ndown the hill to them, still singing; and when he ceased from lack of\r\nbreath they called him variously: Santa Claus, Old Christmas, Whiskers,\r\nthe Last of the Mohicans, and Father Christmas.  And when he stood among\r\nthem he stood very still, without speech, while great tears welled out of\r\nhis eyes.  He cried silently, a long time, till, as if suddenly\r\nbethinking himself, he sat down in the snow with much creaking and\r\ncrackling of his joints, and from this low vantage point toppled sidewise\r\nand fainted calmly and easily away.\r\n\r\nIn less than a week Old Tarwater was up and limping about the housework\r\nof the cabin, cooking and dish-washing for the five men of the creek.\r\nGenuine sourdoughs (pioneers) they were, tough and hard-bitten, who had\r\nbeen buried so deeply inside the Circle that they did not know there was\r\na Klondike Strike.  The news he brought them was their first word of it.\r\nThey lived on an almost straight-meat diet of moose, caribou, and smoked\r\nsalmon, eked out with wild berries and somewhat succulent wild roots they\r\nhad stocked up with in the summer.  They had forgotten the taste of\r\ncoffee, made fire with a burning glass, carried live fire-sticks with\r\nthem wherever they travelled, and in their pipes smoked dry leaves that\r\nbit the tongue and were pungent to the nostrils.\r\n\r\nThree years before, they had prospected from the head-reaches of the\r\nKoyokuk northward and clear across to the mouth of the Mackenzie on the\r\nArctic Ocean.  Here, on the whaleships, they had beheld their last white\r\nmen and equipped themselves with the last white man’s grub, consisting\r\nprincipally of salt and smoking tobacco.  Striking south and west on the\r\nlong traverse to the junction of the Yukon and Porcupine at Fort Yukon,\r\nthey had found gold on this creek and remained over to work the ground.\r\n\r\nThey hailed the advent of Tarwater with joy, never tired of listening to\r\nhis tales of Forty-Nine, and rechristened him Old Hero.  Also, with tea\r\nmade from spruce needles, with concoctions brewed from the inner willow\r\nbark, and with sour and bitter roots and bulbs from the ground, they\r\ndosed his scurvy out of him, so that he ceased limping and began to lay\r\non flesh over his bony framework.  Further, they saw no reason at all why\r\nhe should not gather a rich treasure of gold from the ground.\r\n\r\n“Don’t know about all of three hundred thousand,” they told him one\r\nmorning, at breakfast, ere they departed to their work, “but how’d a\r\nhundred thousand do, Old Hero?  That’s what we figure a claim is worth,\r\nthe ground being badly spotted, and we’ve already staked your location\r\nnotices.”\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” Old Tarwater answered, “and thanking you kindly, all I can\r\nsay is that a hundred thousand will do nicely, and very nicely, for a\r\nstarter.  Of course, I ain’t goin’ to stop till I get the full three\r\nhundred thousand.  That’s what I come into the country for.”\r\n\r\nThey laughed and applauded his ambition and reckoned they’d have to hunt\r\na richer creek for him.  And Old Hero reckoned that as the spring came on\r\nand he grew spryer, he’d have to get out and do a little snooping around\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“For all anybody knows,” he said, pointing to a hillside across the creek\r\nbottom, “the moss under the snow there may be plumb rooted in nugget\r\ngold.”\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but as the sun rose higher and the days grew longer and\r\nwarmer, he gazed often across the creek at the definite bench-formation\r\nhalf way up the hill.  And, one day, when the thaw was in full swing, he\r\ncrossed the stream and climbed to the bench.  Exposed patches of ground\r\nhad already thawed an inch deep.  On one such patch he stopped, gathered\r\na bunch of moss in his big gnarled hands, and ripped it out by the roots.\r\nThe sun smouldered on dully glistening yellow.  He shook the handful of\r\nmoss, and coarse nuggets, like gravel, fell to the ground.  It was the\r\nGolden Fleece ready for the shearing.\r\n\r\nNot entirely unremembered in Alaskan annals is the summer stampede of\r\n1898 from Fort Yukon to the bench diggings of Tarwater Hill.  And when\r\nTarwater sold his holdings to the Bowdie interests for a sheer\r\nhalf-million and faced for California, he rode a mule over a new-cut\r\ntrail, with convenient road houses along the way, clear to the steamboat\r\nlanding at Fort Yukon.\r\n\r\nAt the first meal on the ocean-going steamship out of St. Michaels, a\r\nwaiter, greyish-haired, pain-ravaged of face, scurvy-twisted of body,\r\nserved him.  Old Tarwater was compelled to look him over twice in order\r\nto make certain he was Charles Crayton.\r\n\r\n“Got it bad, eh, son?” Tarwater queried.\r\n\r\n“Just my luck,” the other complained, after recognition and greeting.\r\n“Only one of the party that the scurvy attacked.  I’ve been through hell.\r\nThe other three are all at work and healthy, getting grub-stake to\r\nprospect up White River this winter.  Anson’s earning twenty-five a day\r\nat carpentering, Liverpool getting twenty logging for the saw-mill, and\r\nBig Bill’s getting forty a day as chief sawyer.  I tried my best, and if\r\nit hadn’t been for scurvy . . .”\r\n\r\n“Sure, son, you done your best, which ain’t much, you being naturally\r\nirritable and hard from too much business.  Now I’ll tell you what.  You\r\nain’t fit to work crippled up this way.  I’ll pay your passage with the\r\ncaptain in kind remembrance of the voyage you gave me, and you can lay up\r\nand take it easy the rest of the trip.  And what are your circumstances\r\nwhen you land at San Francisco?”\r\n\r\nCharles Crayton shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Tell you what,” Tarwater continued.  “There’s work on the ranch for you\r\ntill you can start business again.”\r\n\r\n“I could manage your business for you—” Charles began eagerly.\r\n\r\n“No, siree,” Tarwater declared emphatically.  “But there’s always\r\npost-holes to dig, and cordwood to chop, and the climate’s fine . . . ”\r\n\r\nTarwater arrived home a true prodigal grandfather for whom the fatted\r\ncalf was killed and ready.  But first, ere he sat down at table, he must\r\nstroll out and around.  And sons and daughters of his flesh and of the\r\nlaw needs must go with him fulsomely eating out of the gnarled old hand\r\nthat had half a million to disburse.  He led the way, and no opinion he\r\nslyly uttered was preposterous or impossible enough to draw dissent from\r\nhis following.  Pausing by the ruined water wheel which he had built from\r\nthe standing timber, his face beamed as he gazed across the stretches of\r\nTarwater Valley, and on and up the far heights to the summit of Tarwater\r\nMountain—now all his again.\r\n\r\nA thought came to him that made him avert his face and blow his nose in\r\norder to hide the twinkle in his eyes.  Still attended by the entire\r\nfamily, he strolled on to the dilapidated barn.  He picked up an\r\nage-weathered single-tree from the ground.\r\n\r\n“William,” he said.  “Remember that little conversation we had just\r\nbefore I started to Klondike?  Sure, William, you remember.  You told me\r\nI was crazy.  And I said my father’d have walloped the tar out of me with\r\na single-tree if I’d spoke to him that way.”\r\n\r\n“Aw, but that was only foolin’,” William temporized.\r\n\r\nWilliam was a grizzled man of forty-five, and his wife and grown sons\r\nstood in the group, curiously watching Grandfather Tarwater take off his\r\ncoat and hand it to Mary to hold.\r\n\r\n“William—come here,” he commanded imperatively.\r\n\r\nNo matter how reluctantly, William came.\r\n\r\n“Just a taste, William, son, of what my father give me often enough,” Old\r\nTarwater crooned, as he laid on his son’s back and shoulders with the\r\nsingle-tree.  “Observe, I ain’t hitting you on the head.  My father had a\r\ngosh-wollickin’ temper and never drew the line at heads when he went\r\nafter tar.—Don’t jerk your elbows back that way!  You’re likely to get a\r\ncrack on one by accident.  And just tell me one thing, William, son: is\r\nthere nary notion in your head that I’m crazy?”\r\n\r\n“No!” William yelped out in pain, as he danced about.  “You ain’t crazy,\r\nfather of course you ain’t crazy!”\r\n\r\n“You said it,” Old Tarwater remarked sententiously, tossing the\r\nsingle-tree aside and starting to struggle into his coat.  “Now let’s all\r\ngo in and eat.”\r\n\r\n                                 THE END.\r\n\r\nGlen Ellen, California,\r\n      _September_ 14, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCESS\r\n\r\n\r\nA FIRE burned cheerfully in the jungle camp, and beside the fire lolled a\r\ncheerful-seeming though horrible-appearing man.  This was a hobo jungle,\r\npitched in a thin strip of woods that lay between a railroad embankment\r\nand the bank of a river.  But no hobo was the man.  So deep-sunk was he\r\nin the social abyss that a proper hobo would not sit by the same fire\r\nwith him.  A gay-cat, who is an ignorant new-comer on the “Road,” might\r\nsit with such as he, but only long enough to learn better.  Even low down\r\nbindle-stiffs and stew-bums, after a once-over, would have passed this\r\nman by.  A genuine hobo, a couple of punks, or a bunch of tender-yeared\r\nroad-kids might have gone through his rags for any stray pennies or\r\nnickels and kicked him out into the darkness.  Even an alki-stiff would\r\nhave reckoned himself immeasurably superior.\r\n\r\nFor this man was that hybrid of tramp-land, an alki-stiff that has\r\ndegenerated into a stew-bum, with so little self-respect that he will\r\nnever “boil-up,” and with so little pride that he will eat out of a\r\ngarbage can.  He was truly horrible-appearing.  He might have been sixty\r\nyears of age; he might have been ninety.  His garments might have been\r\ndiscarded by a rag-picker.  Beside him, an unrolled bundle showed itself\r\nas consisting of a ragged overcoat and containing an empty and\r\nsmoke-blackened tomato can, an empty and battered condensed milk can,\r\nsome dog-meat partly wrapped in brown paper and evidently begged from\r\nsome butcher-shop, a carrot that had been run over in the street by a\r\nwagon-wheel, three greenish-cankered and decayed potatoes, and a\r\nsugar-bun with a mouthful bitten from it and rescued from the gutter, as\r\nwas made patent by the gutter-filth that still encrusted it.\r\n\r\nA prodigious growth of whiskers, greyish-dirty and untrimmed for years,\r\nsprouted from his face.  This hirsute growth should have been white, but\r\nthe season was summer and it had not been exposed to a rain-shower for\r\nsome time.  What was visible of the face looked as if at some period it\r\nhad stopped a hand-grenade.  The nose was so variously malformed in its\r\nhealed brokenness that there was no bridge, while one nostril, the size\r\nof a pea, opened downward, and the other, the size of a robin’s egg,\r\ntilted upward to the sky.  One eye, of normal size, dim-brown and misty,\r\nbulged to the verge of popping out, and as if from senility wept\r\ncopiously and continuously.  The other eye, scarcely larger than a\r\nsquirrel’s and as uncannily bright, twisted up obliquely into the hairy\r\nscar of a bone-crushed eyebrow.  And he had but one arm.\r\n\r\nYet was he cheerful.  On his face, in mild degree, was depicted sensuous\r\npleasure as he lethargically scratched his ribs with his one hand.  He\r\npawed over his food-scraps, debated, then drew a twelve-ounce druggist\r\nbottle from his inside coat-pocket.  The bottle was full of a colourless\r\nliquid, the contemplation of which made his little eye burn brighter and\r\nquickened his movements.  Picking up the tomato can, he arose, went down\r\nthe short path to the river, and returned with the can filled with\r\nnot-nice river water.  In the condensed milk can he mixed one part of\r\nwater with two parts of fluid from the bottle.  This colourless fluid was\r\ndruggist’s alcohol, and as such is known in tramp-land as “alki.”\r\n\r\nSlow footsteps, coming down the side of the railroad embankment, alarmed\r\nhim ere he could drink.  Placing the can carefully upon the ground\r\nbetween his legs, he covered it with his hat and waited anxiously\r\nwhatever impended.\r\n\r\nOut of the darkness emerged a man as filthy ragged as he.  The new-comer,\r\nwho might have been fifty, and might have been sixty, was grotesquely\r\nfat.  He bulged everywhere.  He was composed of bulges.  His bulbous nose\r\nwas the size and shape of a turnip.  His eyelids bulged and his blue eyes\r\nbulged in competition with them.  In many places the seams of his\r\ngarments had parted across the bulges of body.  His calves grew into his\r\nfeet, for the broken elastic sides of his Congress gaiters were swelled\r\nfull with the fat of him.  One arm only he sported, from the shoulder of\r\nwhich was suspended a small and tattered bundle with the mud caked dry on\r\nthe outer covering from the last place he had pitched his doss.  He\r\nadvanced with tentative caution, made sure of the harmlessness of the man\r\nbeside the fire, and joined him.\r\n\r\n“Hello, grandpa,” the new-comer greeted, then paused to stare at the\r\nother’s flaring, sky-open nostril.  “Say, Whiskers, how’d ye keep the\r\nnight dew out of that nose o’ yourn?”\r\n\r\nWhiskers growled an incoherence deep in his throat and spat into the fire\r\nin token that he was not pleased by the question.\r\n\r\n“For the love of Mike,” the fat man chuckled, “if you got caught out in a\r\nrainstorm without an umbrella you’d sure drown, wouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Can it, Fatty, can it,” Whiskers muttered wearily.  “They ain’t nothin’\r\nnew in that line of chatter.  Even the bulls hand it out to me.”\r\n\r\n“But you can still drink, I hope”; Fatty at the same time mollified and\r\ninvited, with his one hand deftly pulling the slip-knots that fastened\r\nhis bundle.\r\n\r\nFrom within the bundle he brought to light a twelve-ounce bottle of alki.\r\nFootsteps coming down the embankment alarmed him, and he hid the bottle\r\nunder his hat on the ground between his legs.\r\n\r\nBut the next comer proved to be not merely one of their own ilk, but\r\nlikewise to have only one arm.  So forbidding of aspect was he that\r\ngreetings consisted of no more than grunts.  Huge-boned, tall, gaunt to\r\ncadaverousness, his face a dirty death’s head, he was as repellent a\r\nnightmare of old age as ever Doré imagined.  His toothless, thin-lipped\r\nmouth was a cruel and bitter slash under a great curved nose that almost\r\nmet the chin and that was like a buzzard’s beak.  His one hand, lean and\r\ncrooked, was a talon.  The beady grey eyes, unblinking and unwavering,\r\nwere bitter as death, as bleak as absolute zero and as merciless.  His\r\npresence was a chill, and Whiskers and Fatty instinctively drew together\r\nfor protection against the unguessed threat of him.  Watching his chance,\r\nprivily, Whiskers snuggled a chunk of rock several pounds in weigh close\r\nto his hand if need for action should arise.  Fatty duplicated the\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nThen both sat licking their lips, guiltily embarrassed, while the\r\nunblinking eyes of the terrible one bored into them, now into one, now\r\ninto another, and then down at the rock-chunks of their preparedness.\r\n\r\n“Huh!” sneered the terrible one, with such dreadfulness of menace as to\r\ncause Whiskers and Fatty involuntarily to close their hands down on their\r\ncave-man’s weapons.\r\n\r\n“Huh!” the other repeated, reaching his one talon into his side coat\r\npocket with swift definiteness.  “A hell of a chance you two cheap bums\r\n’d have with me.”\r\n\r\nThe talon emerged, clutching ready for action a six-pound iron quoit.\r\n\r\n“We ain’t lookin’ for trouble, Slim,” Fatty quavered.\r\n\r\n“Who in hell are you to call me ‘Slim’?” came the snarling answer.\r\n\r\n“Me?  I’m just Fatty, an’ seein’ ’s I never seen you before—”\r\n\r\n“An’ I suppose that’s Whiskers, there, with the gay an’ festive lamp\r\ntan-going into his eyebrow an’ the God-forgive-us nose joy-riding all\r\nover his mug?”\r\n\r\n“It’ll do, it’ll do,” Whiskers muttered uncomfortably.  “One monica’s as\r\ngood as another, I find, at my time of life.  And everybody hands it out\r\nto me anyway.  And I need an umbrella when it rains to keep from getting\r\ndrowned, an’ all the rest of it.”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t used to company—don’t like it,” Slim growled.  “So if you guys\r\nwant to stick around, mind your step, that’s all, mind your step.”\r\n\r\nHe fished from his pocket a cigar stump, self-evidently shot from the\r\ngutter, and prepared to put it in his mouth to chew.  Then he changed his\r\nmind, glared at his companions savagely, and unrolled his bundle.\r\nAppeared in his hand a druggist’s bottle of alki.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he snarled, “I suppose I gotta give you cheap skates a drink when\r\nI ain’t got more’n enough for a good petrification for myself.”\r\n\r\nAlmost a softening flicker of light was imminent in his withered face as\r\nhe beheld the others proudly lift their hats and exhibit their own\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n“Here’s some water for the mixin’s,” Whiskers said, proffering his\r\ntomato-can of river slush.  “Stockyards just above,” he added\r\napologetically.  “But they say—”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” Slim snapped short, mixing the drink.  “I’ve drunk worse’n\r\nstockyards in my time.”\r\n\r\nYet when all was ready, cans of alki in their solitary hands, the three\r\nthings that had once been men hesitated, as if of old habit, and next\r\nbetrayed shame as if at self-exposure.\r\n\r\nWhiskers was the first to brazen it.\r\n\r\n“I’ve sat in at many a finer drinking,” he bragged.\r\n\r\n“With the pewter,” Slim sneered.\r\n\r\n“With the silver,” Whiskers corrected.\r\n\r\nSlim turned a scorching eye-interrogation on Fatty.\r\n\r\nFatty nodded.\r\n\r\n“Beneath the salt,” said Slim.\r\n\r\n“Above it,” came Fatty’s correction.  “I was born above it, and I’ve\r\nnever travelled second class.  First or steerage, but no intermediate in\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\n“Yourself?” Whiskers queried of Slim.\r\n\r\n“In broken glass to the Queen, God bless her,” Slim answered, solemnly,\r\nwithout snarl or sneer.\r\n\r\n“In the pantry?” Fatty insinuated.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously Slim reached for his quoit, and Whiskers and Fatty for\r\ntheir rocks.\r\n\r\n“Now don’t let’s get feverish,” Fatty said, dropping his own weapon.  “We\r\naren’t scum.  We’re gentlemen.  Let’s drink like gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“Let it be a real drinking,” Whiskers approved.\r\n\r\n“Let’s get petrified,” Slim agreed.  “Many a distillery’s flowed under\r\nthe bridge since we were gentlemen; but let’s forget the long road we’ve\r\ntravelled since, and hit our doss in the good old fashion in which every\r\ngentleman went to bed when we were young.”\r\n\r\n“My father done it—did it,” Fatty concurred and corrected, as old\r\nrecollections exploded long-sealed brain-cells of connotation and correct\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nThe other two nodded a descent from similar fathers, and elevated their\r\ntin cans of alcohol.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nBy the time each had finished his own bottle and from his rags fished\r\nforth a second one, their brains were well-mellowed and a-glow, although\r\nthey had not got around to telling their real names.  But their English\r\nhad improved.  They spoke it correctly, while the argo of tramp-land\r\nceased from their lips.\r\n\r\n“It’s my constitution,” Whiskers was explaining.  “Very few men could go\r\nthrough what I have and live to tell the tale.  And I never took any care\r\nof myself.  If what the moralists and the physiologists say were true,\r\nI’d have been dead long ago.  And it’s the same with you two.  Look at\r\nus, at our advanced years, carousing as the young ones don’t dare,\r\nsleeping out in the open on the ground, never sheltered from frost nor\r\nrain nor storm, never afraid of pneumonia or rheumatism that would put\r\nhalf the young ones on their backs in hospital.”\r\n\r\nHe broke off to mix another drink, and Fatty took up the tale.\r\n\r\n“And we’ve had our fun,” he boasted, “and speaking of sweethearts and\r\nall,” he cribbed from Kipling, “‘We’ve rogued and we’ve ranged—’”\r\n\r\n“‘In our time,’” Slim completed the crib for him.\r\n\r\n“I should say so, I should say so,” Fatty confirmed.  “And been loved by\r\nprincesses—at least I have.”\r\n\r\n“Go on and tell us about it,” Whiskers urged.  “The night’s young, and\r\nwhy shouldn’t we remember back to the roofs of kings?”\r\n\r\nNothing loth, Fatty cleared his throat for the recital and cast about in\r\nhis mind for the best way to begin.\r\n\r\n“It must be known that I came of good family.  Percival Delaney, let us\r\nsay, yes, let us say Percival Delaney, was not unknown at Oxford once\r\nupon a time—not for scholarship, I am frank to admit; but the gay young\r\ndogs of that day, if any be yet alive, would remember him—”\r\n\r\n“My people came over with the Conqueror,” Whiskers interrupted, extending\r\nhis hand to Fatty’s in acknowledgment of the introduction.\r\n\r\n“What name?” Fatty queried.  “I did not seem quite to catch it.”\r\n\r\n“Delarouse, Chauncey Delarouse.  The name will serve as well as any.”\r\n\r\nBoth completed the handshake and glanced to Slim.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, while we’re about it . . . ”  Fatty urged.\r\n\r\n“Bruce Cadogan Cavendish,” Slim growled morosely.  “Go on, Percival, with\r\nyour princesses and the roofs of kings.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I was a rare young devil,” Percival obliged, “after I played ducks\r\nand drakes at home and sported out over the world.  And I was some figure\r\nof a man before I lost my shape—polo, steeple-chasing, boxing.  I won\r\nmedals at buckjumping in Australia, and I held more than several swimming\r\nrecords from the quarter of a mile up.  Women turned their heads to look\r\nwhen I went by.  The women!  God bless them!”\r\n\r\nAnd Fatty, alias Percival Delaney, a grotesque of manhood, put his bulgy\r\nhand to his puffed lips and kissed audibly into the starry vault of the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n“And the Princess!” he resumed, with another kiss to the stars.  “She was\r\nas fine a figure of a woman as I was a man, as high-spirited and\r\ncourageous, as reckless and dare-devilish.  Lord, Lord, in the water she\r\nwas a mermaid, a sea-goddess.  And when it came to blood, beside her I\r\nwas parvenu.  Her royal line traced back into the mists of antiquity.\r\n\r\n“She was not a daughter of a fair-skinned folk.  Tawny golden was she,\r\nwith golden-brown eyes, and her hair that fell to her knees was\r\nblue-black and straight, with just the curly tendrilly tendency that\r\ngives to woman’s hair its charm.  Oh, there were no kinks in it, any more\r\nthan were there kinks in the hair of her entire genealogy.  For she was\r\nPolynesian, glowing, golden, lovely and lovable, royal Polynesian.”\r\n\r\nAgain he paused to kiss his hand to the memory of her, and Slim, alias\r\nBruce Cadogan Cavendish, took advantage to interject:\r\n\r\n“Huh!  Maybe you didn’t shine in scholarship, but at least you gleaned a\r\nvocabulary out of Oxford.”\r\n\r\n“And in the South Seas garnered a better vocabulary from the lexicon of\r\nLove,” Percival was quick on the uptake.\r\n\r\n“It was the island of Talofa,” he went on, “meaning love, the Isle of\r\nLove, and it was her island.  Her father, the king, an old man, sat on\r\nhis mats with paralysed knees and drank squareface gin all day and most\r\nof the night, out of grief, sheer grief.  She, my princess, was the only\r\nissue, her brother having been lost in their double canoe in a hurricane\r\nwhile coming up from a voyage to Samoa.  And among the Polynesians the\r\nroyal women have equal right with the men to rule.  In fact, they trace\r\ntheir genealogies always by the female line.”\r\n\r\nTo this both Chauncey Delarouse and Bruce Cadogan Cavendish nodded prompt\r\naffirmation.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Percival, “I perceive you both know the South Seas, wherefore,\r\nwithout undue expenditure of verbiage on my part, I am assured that you\r\nwill appreciate the charm of my princess, the Princess Tui-nui of Talofa,\r\nthe Princess of the Isle of Love.”\r\n\r\nHe kissed his hand to her, sipped from his condensed milk can a man-size\r\ndrink of druggist’s alcohol, and to her again kissed her hand.\r\n\r\n“But she was coy, and ever she fluttered near to me but never near\r\nenough.  When my arm went out to her to girdle her, presto, she was not\r\nthere.  I knew, as never before, nor since, the thousand dear and\r\ndelightful anguishes of love frustrated but ever resilient and beckoned\r\non by the very goddess of love.”\r\n\r\n“Some vocabulary,” Bruce Cadogan Cavendish muttered in aside to Chauncey\r\nDelarouse.  But Percival Delaney was not to be deterred.  He kissed his\r\npudgy hand aloft into the night and held warmly on.\r\n\r\n“No fond agonies of rapture deferred that were not lavished upon me by my\r\ndear Princess, herself ever a luring delight of promise flitting just\r\nbeyond my reach.  Every sweet lover’s inferno unguessed of by Dante she\r\nled me through.  Ah!  Those swooning tropic nights, under our palm trees,\r\nthe distant surf a langourous murmur as from some vast sea shell of\r\nmystery, when she, my Princess, all but melted to my yearning, and with\r\nher laughter, that was as silver strings by buds and blossoms smitten,\r\nall but made lunacy of my lover’s ardency.\r\n\r\n“It was by my wrestling with the champions of Talofa that I first\r\ninterested her.  It was by my prowess at swimming that I awoke her.  And\r\nit was by a certain swimming deed that I won from her more than\r\ncoquettish smiles and shy timidities of feigned retreat.\r\n\r\n“We were squidding that day, out on the reef—you know how, undoubtedly,\r\ndiving down the face of the wall of the reef, five fathoms, ten fathoms,\r\nany depth within reason, and shoving our squid-sticks into the likely\r\nholes and crannies of the coral where squid might be lairing.  With the\r\nsquid-stick, bluntly sharp at both ends, perhaps a foot long, and held\r\ncrosswise in the hand, the trick was to gouge any lazying squid until he\r\nclosed his tentacles around fist, stick and arm.—Then you had him, and\r\ncame to the surface with him, and hit him in the head which is in the\r\ncentre of him, and peeled him off into the waiting canoe. . . . And to\r\nthink I used to do that!”\r\n\r\nPercival Delaney paused a moment, a glimmer of awe on his rotund face, as\r\nhe contemplated the mighty picture of his youth.\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ve pulled out a squid with tentacles eight feet long, and done it\r\nunder fifty feet of water.  I could stay down four minutes.  I’ve gone\r\ndown, with a coral-rock to sink me, in a hundred and ten feet to clear a\r\nfouled anchor.  And I could back-dive with a once-over and go in\r\nfeet-first from eighty feet above the surface—”\r\n\r\n“Quit it, delete it, cease it,” Chauncey Delarouse admonished testily.\r\n“Tell of the Princess.  That’s what makes old blood leap again.  Almost\r\ncan I see her.  Was she wonderful?”\r\n\r\nPercival Delaney kissed unutterable affirmation.\r\n\r\n“I have said she was a mermaid.  She was.  I know she swam thirty-six\r\nhours before being rescued, after her schooner was capsized in a\r\ndouble-squall.  I have seen her do ninety feet and bring up pearl shell\r\nin each hand.  She was wonderful.  As a woman she was ravishing, sublime.\r\nI have said she was a sea-goddess.  She was.  Oh, for a Phidias or a\r\nPraxiteles to have made the wonder of her body immortal!\r\n\r\n“And that day, out for squid on the reef, I was almost sick for her.\r\nMad—I know I was mad for her.  We would step over the side from the big\r\ncanoe, and swim down, side by side, into the delicious depths of cool and\r\ncolour, and she would look at me, as we swam, and with her eyes tantalize\r\nme to further madness.  And at last, down, far down, I lost myself and\r\nreached for her.  She eluded me like the mermaid she was, and I saw the\r\nlaughter on her face as she fled.  She fled deeper, and I knew I had her\r\nfor I was between her and the surface; but in the muck coral sand of the\r\nbottom she made a churning with her squid stick.  It was the old trick to\r\nescape a shark.  And she worked it on me, rolling the water so that I\r\ncould not see her.  And when I came up, she was there ahead of me,\r\nclinging to the side of the canoe and laughing.\r\n\r\n“Almost I would not be denied.  But not for nothing was she a princess.\r\nShe rested her hand on my arm and compelled me to listen.  We should play\r\na game, she said, enter into a competition for which should get the more\r\nsquid, the biggest squid, and the smallest squid.  Since the wagers were\r\nkisses, you can well imagine I went down on the first next dive with soul\r\naflame.\r\n\r\n“I got no squid.  Never again in all my life have I dived for squid.\r\nPerhaps we were five fathoms down and exploring the face of the reefwall\r\nfor lurking places of our prey, when it happened.  I had found a likely\r\nlair and just proved it empty, when I felt or sensed the nearness of\r\nsomething inimical.  I turned.  There it was, alongside of me, and no\r\nmere fish-shark.  Fully a dozen feet in length, with the unmistakable\r\nphosphorescent cat’s eye gleaming like a drowning star, I knew it for\r\nwhat it was, a tiger shark.\r\n\r\n“Not ten feet to the right, probing a coral fissure with her squid stick,\r\nwas the Princess, and the tiger shark was heading directly for her.  My\r\ntotality of thought was precipitated to consciousness in a single\r\nall-embracing flash.  The man-eater must be deflected from her, and what\r\nwas I, except a mad lover who would gladly fight and die, or more gladly\r\nfight and live, for his beloved?  Remember, she was the woman wonderful,\r\nand I was aflame for her.\r\n\r\n“Knowing fully the peril of my act, I thrust the blunt-sharp end of my\r\nsquid-stick into the side of the shark, much as one would attract a\r\npassing acquaintance with a thumb-nudge in the ribs.  And the man-eater\r\nturned on me.  You know the South Seas, and you know that the tiger\r\nshark, like the bald-face grizzly of Alaska, never gives trail.  The\r\ncombat, fathoms deep under the sea, was on—if by combat may be named such\r\na one-sided struggle.\r\n\r\n“The Princess unaware, caught her squid and rose to the surface.  The\r\nman-eater rushed me.  I fended him off with both hands on his nose above\r\nhis thousand-toothed open mouth, so that he backed me against the sharp\r\ncoral.  The scars are there to this day.  Whenever I tried to rise, he\r\nrushed me, and I could not remain down there indefinitely without air.\r\nWhenever he rushed me, I fended him off with my hands on his nose.  And I\r\nwould have escaped unharmed, except for the slip of my right hand.  Into\r\nhis mouth it went to the elbow.  His jaws closed, just below the elbow.\r\nYou know how a shark’s teeth are.  Once in they cannot be released.  They\r\nmust go through to complete the bite, but they cannot go through heavy\r\nbone.  So, from just below the elbow he stripped the bone clean to the\r\narticulation of the wrist-joint, where his teeth met and my good right\r\nhand became his for an appetizer.\r\n\r\n“But while he was doing this, I drove the thumb of my left hand, to the\r\nhilt into his eye-orifice and popped out his eye.  This did not stop him.\r\nThe meat had maddened him.  He pursued the gushing stump of my wrist.\r\nHalf a dozen times I fended with my intact arm.  Then he got the poor\r\nmangled arm again, closed down, and stripped the meat off the bone from\r\nthe shoulder down to the elbow-joint, where his teeth met and he was free\r\nof his second mouthful of me.  But, at the same time, with my good arm, I\r\nthumbed out his remaining eye.”\r\n\r\nPercival Delaney shrugged his shoulders, ere he resumed.\r\n\r\n“From above, those in the canoe had beheld the entire happening and were\r\nloud in praise of my deed.  To this day they still sing the song of me,\r\nand tell the tale of me.  And the Princess.”  His pause was brief but\r\nsignificant.  “The Princess married me. . . . Oh, well-a-day and\r\nlack-a-day, the whirligig of time and fortune, the topsyturviness of\r\nluck, the wooden shoe going up and the polished heel descending a French\r\ngunboat, a conquered island kingdom of Oceania, to-day ruled over by a\r\npeasant-born, unlettered, colonial gendarme, and . . . ”\r\n\r\nHe completed the sentence and the tale by burying his face in the\r\ndown-tilted mouth of the condensed milk can and by gurgling the corrosive\r\ndrink down his throat in thirsty gulps.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter an appropriate pause, Chauncey Delarouse, otherwise Whiskers, took\r\nup the tale.\r\n\r\n“Far be it from me to boast of no matter what place of birth I have\r\ndescended from to sit here by this fire with such as . . . as chance\r\nalong.  I may say, however, that I, too, was once a considerable figure\r\nof a man.  I may add that it was horses, plus parents too indulgent, that\r\nexiled me out over the world.  I may still wonder to query: ‘Are Dover’s\r\ncliffs still white?’”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” Bruce Cadogan Cavendish sneered.  “Next you’ll be asking: ‘How\r\nfares the old Lord Warden?’”\r\n\r\n“And I took every liberty, and vainly, with a constitution that was\r\niron,” Whiskers hurried on.  “Here I am with my three score and ten\r\nbehind me, and back on that long road have I buried many a youngster that\r\nwas as rare and devilish as I, but who could not stand the pace.  I knew\r\nthe worst too young.  And now I know the worst too old.  But there was a\r\ntime, alas all too short, when I knew, the best.\r\n\r\n“I, too, kiss my hand to the Princess of my heart.  She was truly a\r\nprincess, Polynesian, a thousand miles and more away to the eastward and\r\nthe south from Delaney’s Isle of Love.  The natives of all around that\r\npart of the South Seas called it the Jolly Island.  Their own name, the\r\nname of the people who dwelt thereon, translates delicately and justly\r\ninto ‘The Island of Tranquil Laughter.’  On the chart you will find the\r\nerroneous name given to it by the old navigators to be Manatomana.  The\r\nseafaring gentry the round ocean around called it the Adamless Eden.  And\r\nthe missionaries for a time called it God’s Witness—so great had been\r\ntheir success at converting the inhabitants.  As for me, it was, and ever\r\nshall be, Paradise.\r\n\r\n“It was _my_ Paradise, for it was there my Princess lived.  John Asibeli\r\nTungi was king.  He was full-blooded native, descended out of the oldest\r\nand highest chief-stock that traced back to Manua which was the primeval\r\nsea home of the race.  Also was he known as John the Apostate.  He lived\r\na long life and apostasized frequently.  First converted by the\r\nCatholics, he threw down the idols, broke the tabus, cleaned out the\r\nnative priests, executed a few of the recalcitrant ones, and sent all his\r\nsubjects to church.\r\n\r\n“Next he fell for the traders, who developed in him a champagne thirst,\r\nand he shipped off the Catholic priests to New Zealand.  The great\r\nmajority of his subjects always followed his lead, and, having no\r\nreligion at all, ensued the time of the Great Licentiousness, when by all\r\nSouth Seas missionaries his island, in sermons, was spoken of as Babylon.\r\n\r\n“But the traders ruined his digestion with too much champagne, and after\r\nseveral years he fell for the Gospel according to the Methodists, sent\r\nhis people to church, and cleaned up the beach and the trading crowd so\r\nspick and span that he would not permit them to smoke a pipe out of doors\r\non Sunday, and, fined one of the chief traders one hundred gold\r\nsovereigns for washing his schooner’s decks on the Sabbath morn.\r\n\r\n“That was the time of the Blue Laws, but perhaps it was too rigorous for\r\nKing John.  Off he packed the Methodists, one fine day, exiled several\r\nhundred of his people to Samoa for sticking to Methodism, and, of all\r\nthings, invented a religion of his own, with himself the figure-head of\r\nworship.  In this he was aided and abetted by a renegade Fijian.  This\r\nlasted five years.  Maybe he grew tired of being God, or maybe it was\r\nbecause the Fijian decamped with the six thousand pounds in the royal\r\ntreasury; but at any rate the Second Reformed Wesleyans got him, and his\r\nentire kingdom went Wesleyan.  The pioneer Wesleyan missionary he\r\nactually made prime minister, and what he did to the trading crowd was a\r\ncaution.  Why, in the end, King John’s kingdom was blacklisted and\r\nboycotted by the traders till the revenues diminished to zero, the people\r\nwent bankrupt, and King John couldn’t borrow a shilling from his most\r\npowerful chief.\r\n\r\n“By this time he was getting old, and philosophic, and tolerant, and\r\nspiritually atavistic.  He fired out the Second Reformed Wesleyans,\r\ncalled back the exiles from Samoa, invited in the traders, held a general\r\nlove-feast, took the lid off, proclaimed religious liberty and high\r\ntariff, and as for himself went back to the worship of his ancestors, dug\r\nup the idols, reinstated a few octogenarian priests, and observed the\r\ntabus.  All of which was lovely for the traders, and prosperity reigned.\r\nOf course, most of his subjects followed him back into heathen worship.\r\nYet quite a sprinkling of Catholics, Methodists and Wesleyans remained\r\ntrue to their beliefs and managed to maintain a few squalid, one-horse\r\nchurches.  But King John didn’t mind, any more than did he the high times\r\nof the traders along the beach.  Everything went, so long as the taxes\r\nwere paid.  Even when his wife, Queen Mamare, elected to become a\r\nBaptist, and invited in a little, weazened, sweet-spirited, club-footed\r\nBaptist missionary, King John did not object.  All he insisted on was\r\nthat these wandering religions should be self-supporting and not feed a\r\npennyworth’s out of the royal coffers.\r\n\r\n“And now the threads of my recital draw together in the paragon of female\r\nexquisiteness—my Princess.”\r\n\r\nWhiskers paused, placed carefully on the ground his half-full condensed\r\nmilk can with which he had been absently toying, and kissed the fingers\r\nof his one hand audibly aloft.\r\n\r\n“She was the daughter of Queen Mamare.  She was the woman wonderful.\r\nUnlike the Diana type of Polynesian, she was almost ethereal.  She _was_\r\nethereal, sublimated by purity, as shy and modest as a violet, as\r\nfragile-slender as a lily, and her eyes, luminous and shrinking tender,\r\nwere as asphodels on the sward of heaven.  She was all flower, and fire,\r\nand dew.  Hers was the sweetness of the mountain rose, the gentleness of\r\nthe dove.  And she was all of good as well as all of beauty, devout in\r\nher belief in her mother’s worship, which was the worship introduced by\r\nEbenezer Naismith, the Baptist missionary.  But make no mistake.  She was\r\nno mere sweet spirit ripe for the bosom of Abraham.  All of exquisite\r\ndeliciousness of woman was she.  She was woman, all woman, to the last\r\nsensitive quivering atom of her—\r\n\r\n“And I?  I was a wastrel of the beach.  The wildest was not so wild as I,\r\nthe keenest not so keen, of all that wild, keen trading crowd.  It was\r\nesteemed I played the stiffest hand of poker.  I was the only living man,\r\nwhite, brown, or black, who dared run the Kuni-kuni Passage in the dark.\r\nAnd on a black night I have done it under reefs in a gale of wind.  Well,\r\nanyway, I had a bad reputation on a beach where there were no good\r\nreputations.  I was reckless, dangerous, stopped at nothing in fight or\r\nfrolic; and the trading captains used to bring boiler-sheeted prodigies\r\nfrom the vilest holes of the South Pacific to try and drink me under the\r\ntable.  I remember one, a calcined Scotchman from the New Hebrides.  It\r\nwas a great drinking.  He died of it, and we laded him aboard ship,\r\npickled in a cask of trade rum, and sent him back to his own place.  A\r\nsample, a fair sample, of the antic tricks we cut up on the beach of\r\nManatomana.\r\n\r\n“And of all unthinkable things, what did I up and do, one day, but look\r\nupon the Princess to find her good and to fall in love with her.  It was\r\nthe real thing.  I was as mad as a March hare, and after that I got only\r\nmadder.  I reformed.  Think of that!  Think of what a slip of a woman can\r\ndo to a busy, roving man!—By the Lord Harry, it’s true.  I reformed.  I\r\nwent to church.  Hear me!  I became converted.  I cleared my soul before\r\nGod and kept my hands—I had two then—off the ribald crew of the beach\r\nwhen it laughed at this, my latest antic, and wanted to know what was my\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n“I tell you I reformed, and gave myself in passion and sincerity to a\r\nreligious experience that has made me tolerant of all religion ever\r\nsince.  I discharged my best captain for immorality.  So did I my cook,\r\nand a better never boiled water in Manatomana.  For the same reason I\r\ndischarged my chief clerk.  And for the first time in the history of\r\ntrading my schooners to the westward carried Bibles in their stock.  I\r\nbuilt a little anchorite bungalow up town on a mango-lined street\r\nsquarely alongside the little house occupied by Ebenezer Naismith.  And I\r\nmade him my pal and comrade, and found him a veritable honey pot of\r\nsweetnesses and goodnesses.  And he was a man, through and through a man.\r\nAnd he died long after like a man, which I would like to tell you about,\r\nwere the tale of it not so deservedly long.\r\n\r\n“It was the Princess, more than the missionary, who was responsible for\r\nmy expressing my faith in works, and especially in that crowning work,\r\nthe New Church, Our Church, the Queen-mother’s church.\r\n\r\n“‘Our poor church,’ she said to me, one night after prayer-meeting.  I\r\nhad been converted only a fortnight.  ‘It is so small its congregation\r\ncan never grow.  And the roof leaks.  And King John, my hard-hearted\r\nfather, will not contribute a penny.  Yet he has a big balance in the\r\ntreasury.  And Manatomana is not poor.  Much money is made and\r\nsquandered, I know.  I hear the gossip of the wild ways of the beach.\r\nLess than a month ago you lost more in one night, gambling at cards, than\r\nthe cost of the upkeep of our poor church for a year.’\r\n\r\n“And I told her it was true, but that it was before I had seen the light.\r\n(I’d had an infernal run of bad luck.)  I told her I had not tasted\r\nliquor since, nor turned a card.  I told her that the roof would be\r\nrepaired at once, by Christian carpenters selected by her from the\r\ncongregation.  But she was filled with the thought of a great revival\r\nthat Ebenezer Naismith could preach—she was a dear saint—and she spoke of\r\na great church, saying:\r\n\r\n“‘You are rich.  You have many schooners, and traders in far islands, and\r\nI have heard of a great contract you have signed to recruit labour for\r\nthe German plantations of Upolu.  They say, next to Sweitzer, you are the\r\nrichest trader here.  I should love to see some use of all this money\r\nplaced to the glory of God.  It would be a noble thing to do, and I\r\nshould be proud to know the man who would do it.’\r\n\r\n“I told her that Ebenezer Naismith would preach the revival, and that I\r\nwould build a church great enough in which to house it.\r\n\r\n“‘As big as the Catholic church?’ she asked.\r\n\r\n“This was the ruined cathedral, built at the time when the entire\r\npopulation was converted, and it was a large order; but I was afire with\r\nlove, and I told her that the church I would build would be even bigger.\r\n\r\n“‘But it will take money,’ I explained.  ‘And it takes time to make\r\nmoney.’\r\n\r\n“‘You have much,’ she said.  ‘Some say you have more money than my\r\nfather, the King.\r\n\r\n“‘I have more credit,’ I explained.  ‘But you do not understand money.\r\nIt takes money to have credit.  So, with the money I have, and the credit\r\nI have, I will work to make more money and credit, and the church shall\r\nbe built.’\r\n\r\n“Work!  I was a surprise to myself.  It is an amazement, the amount of\r\ntime a man finds on his hands after he’s given up carousing, and\r\ngambling, and all the time-eating diversions of the beach.  And I didn’t\r\nwaste a second of all my new-found time.  Instead I worked it overtime.\r\nI did the work of half a dozen men.  I became a driver.  My captains made\r\nfaster runs than ever and earned bigger bonuses, as did my supercargoes,\r\nwho saw to it that my schooners did not loaf and dawdle along the way.\r\nAnd I saw to it that my supercargoes did see to it.\r\n\r\n“And good!  By the Lord Harry I was so good it hurt.  My conscience got\r\nso expansive and fine-strung it lamed me across the shoulders to carry it\r\naround with me.  Why, I even went back over my accounts and paid Sweitzer\r\nfifty quid I’d jiggered him out of in a deal in Fiji three years before.\r\nAnd I compounded the interest as well.\r\n\r\n“Work!  I planted sugar cane—the first commercial planting on Manatomana.\r\nI ran in cargoes of kinky-heads from Malaita, which is in the Solomons,\r\ntill I had twelve hundred of the blackbirds putting in cane.  And I sent\r\na schooner clear to Hawaii to bring back a dismantled sugar mill and a\r\nGerman who said he knew the field-end of cane.  And he did, and he\r\ncharged me three hundred dollars screw a month, and I took hold of the\r\nmill-end.  I installed the mill myself, with the help of several\r\nmechanics I brought up from Queensland.\r\n\r\n“Of course there was a rival.  His name was Motomoe.  He was the very\r\nhighest chief blood next to King John’s.  He was full native, a\r\nstrapping, handsome man, with a glowering way of showing his dislikes.\r\nHe certainly glowered at me when I began hanging around the palace.  He\r\nwent back in my history and circulated the blackest tales about me.  The\r\nworst of it was that most of them were true.  He even made a voyage to\r\nApia to find things out—as if he couldn’t find a plenty right there on\r\nthe beach of Manatomana!  And he sneered at my failing for religion, and\r\nat my going to prayer-meeting, and, most of all, at my sugar-planting.\r\nHe challenged me to fight, and I kept off of him.  He threatened me, and\r\nI learned in the nick of time of his plan to have me knocked on the head.\r\nYou see, he wanted the Princess just as much as I did, and I wanted her\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“She used to play the piano.  So did I, once.  But I never let her know\r\nafter I’d heard her play the first time.  And she thought her playing was\r\nwonderful, the dear, fond girl!  You know the sort, the mechanical\r\none-two-three tum-tum-tum school-girl stuff.  And now I’ll tell you\r\nsomething funnier.  Her playing _was_ wonderful to me.  The gates of\r\nheaven opened to me when she played.  I can see myself now, worn out and\r\ndog-tired after the long day, lying on the mats of the palace veranda and\r\ngazing upon her at the piano, myself in a perfect idiocy of bliss.  Why,\r\nthis idea she had of her fine playing was the one flaw in her\r\ndeliciousness of perfection, and I loved her for it.  It kind of brought\r\nher within my human reach.  Why, when she played her one-two-three,\r\ntum-tum-tum, I was in the seventh heaven of bliss.  My weariness fell\r\nfrom me.  I loved her, and my love for her was clean as flame, clean as\r\nmy love for God.  And do you know, into my fond lover’s fancy continually\r\nintruded the thought that God in most ways must look like her.\r\n\r\n“—That’s right, Bruce Cadogan Cavendish, sneer as you like.  But I tell\r\nyou that’s love that I’ve been describing.  That’s all.  It’s love.  It’s\r\nthe realest, purest, finest thing that can happen to a man.  And I know\r\nwhat I’m talking about.  It happened to me.”\r\n\r\nWhiskers, his beady squirrel’s eye glittering from out his ruined eyebrow\r\nlike a live coal in a jungle ambush, broke off long enough to down a\r\nsedative draught from his condensed milk can and to mix another.\r\n\r\n“The cane,” he resumed, wiping his prodigious mat of face hair with the\r\nback of his hand.  “It matured in sixteen months in that climate, and I\r\nwas ready, just ready and no more, with the mill for the grinding.\r\nNaturally, it did not all mature at once, but I had planted in such\r\nsuccession that I could grind for nine months steadily, while more was\r\nbeing planted and the ratoons were springing up.\r\n\r\n“I had my troubles the first several days.  If it wasn’t one thing the\r\nmatter with the mill, it was another.  On the fourth day, Ferguson, my\r\nengineer, had to shut down several hours in order to remedy his own\r\ntroubles.  I was bothered by the feeder.  After having the niggers (who\r\nhad been feeding the cane) pour cream of lime on the rollers to keep\r\neverything sweet, I sent them out to join the cane-cutting squads.  So I\r\nwas all alone at that end, just as Ferguson started up the mill, just as\r\nI discovered what was the matter with the feed-rollers, and just as\r\nMotomoe strolled up.\r\n\r\n“He stood there, in Norfolk jacket, pigskin puttees, and all the rest of\r\nthe fashionable get-up out of a bandbox, sneering at me covered with\r\nfilth and grease to the eyebrows and looking like a navvy.  And, the\r\nrollers now white from the lime, I’d just seen what was wrong.  The\r\nrollers were not in plumb.  One side crushed the cane well, but the other\r\nside was too open.  I shoved my fingers in on that side.  The big,\r\ntoothed cogs on the rollers did not touch my fingers.  And yet, suddenly,\r\nthey did.  With the grip of ten thousand devils, my finger-tips were\r\ncaught, drawn in, and pulped to—well, just pulp.  And, like a slick of\r\ncane, I had started on my way.  There was no stopping me.  Ten thousand\r\nhorses could not have pulled me back.  There was nothing to stop me.\r\nHand, arm, shoulder, head, and chest, down to the toes of me, I was\r\ndoomed to feed through.\r\n\r\n“It did hurt.  It hurt so much it did not hurt me at all.  Quite\r\ndetached, almost may I say, I looked on my hand being ground up, knuckle\r\nby knuckle, joint by joint, the back of the hand, the wrist, the forearm,\r\nall in order slowly and inevitably feeding in.  O engineer hoist by thine\r\nown petard!  O sugar-maker crushed by thine own cane-crusher!\r\n\r\n“Motomoe sprang forward involuntarily, and the sneer was chased from his\r\nface by an expression of solicitude.  Then the beauty of the situation\r\ndawned on him, and he chuckled and grinned.  No, I didn’t expect anything\r\nof him.  Hadn’t he tried to knock me on the head?  What could he do\r\nanyway?  He didn’t know anything about engines.\r\n\r\n“I yelled at the top of my lungs to Ferguson to shut off the engine, but\r\nthe roar of the machinery drowned my voice.  And there I stood, up to the\r\nelbow and feeding right on in.  Yes, it did hurt.  There were some\r\nastonishing twinges when special nerves were shredded and dragged out by\r\nthe roots.  But I remember that I was surprised at the time that it did\r\nnot hurt worse.\r\n\r\n“Motomoe made a movement that attracted my attention.  At the same time\r\nhe growled out loud, as if he hated himself, ‘I’m a fool.’  What he had\r\ndone was to pick up a cane-knife—you know the kind, as big as a machete\r\nand as heavy.  And I was grateful to him in advance for putting me out of\r\nmy misery.  There wasn’t any sense in slowly feeding in till my head was\r\ncrushed, and already my arm was pulped half way from elbow to shoulder,\r\nand the pulping was going right on.  So I was grateful, as I bent my head\r\nto the blow.\r\n\r\n“‘Get your head out of the way, you idiot!’ he barked at me.\r\n\r\n“And then I understood and obeyed.  I was a big man, and he took two\r\nhacks to do it; but he hacked my arm off just outside the shoulder and\r\ndragged me back and laid me down on the cane.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the sugar paid—enormously; and I built for the Princess the church\r\nof her saintly dream, and . . . she married me.”\r\n\r\nHe partly assuaged his thirst, and uttered his final word.\r\n\r\n“Alackaday!  Shuttlecock and battle-dore.  And this at, the end of it\r\nall, lined with boilerplate that even alcohol will not corrode and that\r\nonly alcohol will tickle.  Yet have I lived, and I kiss my hand to the\r\ndear dust of my Princess long asleep in the great mausoleum of King John\r\nthat looks across the Vale of Manona to the alien flag that floats over\r\nthe bungalow of the British Government House. . . ”\r\n\r\nFatty pledged him sympathetically, and sympathetically drank out of his\r\nown small can.  Bruce Cadogan Cavendish glared into the fire with\r\nimplacable bitterness.  He was a man who preferred to drink by himself.\r\nAcross the thin lips that composed the cruel slash of his mouth played\r\ntwitches of mockery that caught Fatty’s eye.  And Fatty, making sure\r\nfirst that his rock-chunk was within reach, challenged.\r\n\r\n“Well, how about yourself, Bruce Cadogan Cavendish?  It’s your turn.”\r\n\r\nThe other lifted bleak eyes that bored into Fatty’s until he physically\r\nbetrayed uncomfortableness.\r\n\r\n“I’ve lived a hard life,” Slim grated harshly.  “What do I know about\r\nlove passages?”\r\n\r\n“No man of your build and make-up could have escaped them,” Fatty\r\nwheedled.\r\n\r\n“And what of it?” Slim snarled.  “It’s no reason for a gentleman to boast\r\nof amorous triumphs.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, go on, be a good fellow,” Fatty urged.  “The night’s still young.\r\nWe’ve still some drink left.  Delarouse and I have contributed our share.\r\nIt isn’t often that three real ones like us get together for a telling.\r\nSurely you’ve got at least one adventure in love you aren’t ashamed to\r\ntell about—”\r\n\r\nBruce Cadogan Cavendish pulled forth his iron quoit and seemed to debate\r\nwhether or not he should brain the other.  He sighed, and put back the\r\nquoit.\r\n\r\n“Very well, if you will have it,” he surrendered with manifest\r\nreluctance.  “Like you two, I have had a remarkable constitution.  And\r\nright now, speaking of armour-plate lining, I could drink the both of you\r\ndown when you were at your prime.  Like you two, my beginnings were far\r\ndistant and different.  That I am marked with the hall-mark of gentlehood\r\nthere is no discussion . . . unless either of you care to discuss the\r\nmatter now . . . ”\r\n\r\nHis one hand slipped into his pocket and clutched the quoit.  Neither of\r\nhis auditors spoke nor betrayed any awareness of his menace.\r\n\r\n“It occurred a thousand miles to the westward of Manatomana, on the\r\nisland of Tagalag,” he continued abruptly, with an air of saturnine\r\ndisappointment in that there had been no discussion.  “But first I must\r\ntell you of how I got to Tagalag.  For reasons I shall not mention, by\r\npaths of descent I shall not describe, in the crown of my manhood and the\r\nprime of my devilishness in which Oxford renegades and racing younger\r\nsons had nothing on me, I found myself master and owner of a schooner so\r\nwell known that she shall remain historically nameless.  I was running\r\nblackbird labour from the west South Pacific and the Coral Sea to the\r\nplantations of Hawaii and the nitrate mines of Chili—”\r\n\r\n“It was you who cleaned out the entire population of—” Fatty exploded,\r\nere he could check his speech.\r\n\r\nThe one hand of Bruce Cadogan Cavendish flashed pocketward and flashed\r\nback with the quoit balanced ripe for business.\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” Fatty sighed.  “I . . . I have quite forgotten what I was\r\ngoing to say.”\r\n\r\n“Beastly funny country over that way,” the narrator drawled with perfect\r\ncasualness.  “You’ve read this Sea Wolf stuff—”\r\n\r\n“You weren’t the Sea Wolf,” Whiskers broke in with involuntary\r\npositiveness.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” was the snarling answer.  “The Sea Wolf’s dead, isn’t he?  And\r\nI’m still alive, aren’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course,” Whiskers conceded.  “He suffocated head-first in\r\nthe mud off a wharf in Victoria a couple of years back.”\r\n\r\n“As I was saying—and I don’t like interruptions,” Bruce Cadogan Cavendish\r\nproceeded, “it’s a beastly funny country over that way.  I was at\r\nTaki-Tiki, a low island that politically belongs to the Solomons, but\r\nthat geologically doesn’t at all, for the Solomons are high islands.\r\nEthnographically it belongs to Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia,\r\nbecause all the breeds of the South Pacific have gravitated to it by\r\ncanoe-drift and intricately, degeneratively, and amazingly interbred.\r\nThe scum of the scrapings of the bottom of the human pit, biologically\r\nspeaking, resides in Taka-Tiki.  And I know the bottom and whereof I\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“It was a beastly funny time of it I had, diving out shell, fishing\r\nbeche-de-mer, trading hoop-iron and hatchets for copra and ivory-nuts,\r\nrunning niggers and all the rest of it.  Why, even in Fiji the Lotu was\r\nhaving a hard time of it and the chiefs still eating long-pig.  To the\r\nwestward it was fierce—funny little black kinky-heads, man-eaters the\r\nlast Jack of them, and the jackpot fat and spilling over with wealth—”\r\n\r\n“Jack-pots?” Fatty queried.  At sight of an irritable movement, he added:\r\n“You see, I never got over to the West like Delarouse and you.”\r\n\r\n“They’re all head-hunters.  Heads are valuable, especially a white man’s\r\nhead.  They decorate the canoe-houses and devil-devil houses with them.\r\nEach village runs a jack-pot, and everybody antes.  Whoever brings in a\r\nwhite man’s head takes the pot.  If there aren’t openers for a long time,\r\nthe pot grows to tremendous proportions.  Beastly funny, isn’t it?\r\n\r\n“I know.  Didn’t a Holland mate die on me of blackwater?  And didn’t I\r\nwin a pot myself?  It was this way.  We were lying at Lango-lui at the\r\ntime.  I never let on, and arranged the affair with Johnny, my\r\nboat-steerer.  He was a kinky-head himself from Port Moresby.  He cut the\r\ndead mate’s head off and sneaked ashore in the night, while I whanged\r\naway with my rifle as if I were trying to get him.  He opened the pot\r\nwith the mate’s head, and got it, too.  Of course, next day I sent in a\r\nlanding boat, with two covering boats, and fetched him off with the\r\nloot.”\r\n\r\n“How big was the pot?” Whiskers asked.  “I heard of a pot at Orla worth\r\neighty quid.”\r\n\r\n“To commence with,” Slim answered, “there were forty fat pigs, each worth\r\na fathom of prime shell-money, and shell-money worth a quid a fathom.\r\nThat was two hundred dollars right there.  There were ninety-eight\r\nfathoms of shell-money, which is pretty close to five hundred in itself.\r\nAnd there were twenty-two gold sovereigns.  I split it four ways:\r\none-fourth to Johnny, one-fourth to the ship, one-fourth to me as owner,\r\nand one-fourth to me as skipper.  Johnny never complained.  He’d never\r\nhad so much wealth all at one time in his life.  Besides, I gave him a\r\ncouple of the mate’s old shirts.  And I fancy the mate’s head is still\r\nthere decorating the canoe-house.”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly Christian burial of a Christian,” Whiskers observed.\r\n\r\n“But a lucrative burial,” Slim retorted.  “I had to feed the rest of the\r\nmate over-side to the sharks for nothing.  Think of feeding an\r\neight-hundred-dollar head along with it.  It would have been criminal\r\nwaste and stark lunacy.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway, it was all beastly funny, over there to the westward.\r\nAnd, without telling you the scrape I got into at Taki-Tiki, except that\r\nI sailed away with two hundred kinky-heads for Queensland labour, and for\r\nmy manner of collecting them had two British ships of war combing the\r\nPacific for me, I changed my course and ran to the westward thinking to\r\ndispose of the lot to the Spanish plantations on Bangar.\r\n\r\n“Typhoon season.  We caught it.  The _Merry Mist_ was my schooner’s name,\r\nand I had thought she was stoutly built until she hit that typhoon.  I\r\nnever saw such seas.  They pounded that stout craft to pieces, literally\r\nso.  The sticks were jerked out of her, deckhouses splintered to\r\nmatch-wood, rails ripped off, and, after the worst had passed, the\r\ncovering boards began to go.  We just managed to repair what was left of\r\none boat and keep the schooner afloat only till the sea went down barely\r\nenough to get away.  And we outfitted that boat in a hurry.  The\r\ncarpenter and I were the last, and we had to jump for it as he went down.\r\nThere were only four of us—”\r\n\r\n“Lost all the niggers?” Whiskers inquired.\r\n\r\n“Some of them swam for some time,” Slim replied.  “But I don’t fancy they\r\nmade the land.  We were ten days’ in doing it.  And we had a spanking\r\nbreeze most of the way.  And what do you think we had in the boat with\r\nus?  Cases of square-face gin and cases of dynamite.  Funny, wasn’t it?\r\nWell, it got funnier later on.  Oh, there was a small beaker of water, a\r\nlittle salt horse, and some salt-water-soaked sea biscuit—enough to keep\r\nus alive to Tagalag.\r\n\r\n“Now Tagalag is the disappointingest island I’ve ever beheld.  It shows\r\nup out of the sea so as you can make its fall twenty miles off.  It is a\r\nvolcano cone thrust up out of deep sea, with a segment of the crater wall\r\nbroken out.  This gives sea entrance to the crater itself, and makes a\r\nfine sheltered harbour.  And that’s all.  Nothing lives there.  The\r\noutside and the inside of the crater are too steep.  At one place,\r\ninside, is a patch of about a thousand coconut palms.  And that’s all, as\r\nI said, saving a few insects.  No four-legged thing, even a rat, inhabits\r\nthe place.  And it’s funny, most awful funny, with all those coconuts,\r\nnot even a coconut crab.  The only meat-food living was schools of mullet\r\nin the harbour—fattest, finest, biggest mullet I ever laid eyes on.\r\n\r\n“And the four of us landed on the little beach and set up housekeeping\r\namong the coconuts with a larder full of dynamite and square-face.  Why\r\ndon’t you laugh?  It’s funny, I tell you.  Try it some time.—Holland gin\r\nand straight coconut diet.  I’ve never been able to look a confectioner’s\r\nwindow in the face since.  Now I’m not strong on religion like Chauncey\r\nDelarouse there, but I have some primitive ideas; and my concept of hell\r\nis an illimitable coconut plantation, stocked with cases of square-face\r\nand populated by ship-wrecked mariners.  Funny?  It must make the devil\r\nscream.\r\n\r\n“You know, straight coconut is what the agriculturists call an unbalanced\r\nration.  It certainly unbalanced our digestions.  We got so that whenever\r\nhunger took an extra bite at us, we took another drink of gin.  After a\r\ncouple of weeks of it, Olaf, a squarehead sailor, got an idea.  It came\r\nwhen he was full of gin, and we, being in the same fix, just watched him\r\nshove a cap and short fuse into a stick of dynamite and stroll down\r\ntoward the boat.\r\n\r\n“It dawned on me that he was going to shoot fish if there were any about;\r\nbut the sun was beastly hot, and I just reclined there and hoped he’d\r\nhave luck.\r\n\r\n“About half an hour after he disappeared we heard the explosion.  But he\r\ndidn’t come back.  We waited till the cool of sunset, and down on the\r\nbeach found what had become of him.  The boat was there all right,\r\ngrounded by the prevailing breeze, but there was no Olaf.  He would never\r\nhave to eat coconut again.  We went back, shakier than ever, and cracked\r\nanother square-face.\r\n\r\n“The next day the cook announced that he would rather take his chance\r\nwith dynamite than continue trying to exist on coconut, and that, though\r\nhe didn’t know anything about dynamite, he knew a sight too much about\r\ncoconut.  So we bit the detonator down for him, shoved in a fuse, and\r\npicked him a good fire-stick, while he jolted up with a couple more stiff\r\nones of gin.\r\n\r\n“It was the same programme as the day before.  After a while we heard the\r\nexplosion and at twilight went down to the boat, from which we scraped\r\nenough of the cook for a funeral.\r\n\r\n“The carpenter and I stuck it out two days more, then we drew straws for\r\nit and it was his turn.  We parted with harsh words; for he wanted to\r\ntake a square-face along to refresh himself by the way, while I was set\r\nagainst running any chance of wasting the gin.  Besides, he had more than\r\nhe could carry then, and he wobbled and staggered as he walked.\r\n\r\n“Same thing, only there was a whole lot of him left for me to bury,\r\nbecause he’d prepared only half a stick.  I managed to last it out till\r\nnext day, when, after duly fortifying myself, I got sufficient courage to\r\ntackle the dynamite.  I used only a third of a stick—you know, short\r\nfuse, with the end split so as to hold the head of a safety match.\r\nThat’s where I mended my predecessors’ methods.  Not using the\r\nmatch-head, they’d too-long fuses.  Therefore, when they spotted a school\r\nof mullet; and lighted the fuse, they had to hold the dynamite till the\r\nfuse burned short before they threw it.  If they threw it too soon, it\r\nwouldn’t go off the instant it hit the water, while the splash of it\r\nwould frighten the mullet away.  Funny stuff dynamite.  At any rate, I\r\nstill maintain mine was the safer method.\r\n\r\n“I picked up a school of mullet before I’d been rowing five minutes.\r\nFine big fat ones they were, and I could smell them over the fire.  When\r\nI stood up, fire-stick in one hand, dynamite stick in the other, my knees\r\nwere knocking together.  Maybe it was the gin, or the anxiousness, or the\r\nweakness and the hunger, and maybe it was the result of all of them, but\r\nat any rate I was all of a shake.  Twice I failed to touch the fire-stick\r\nto the dynamite.  Then I did, heard the match-head splutter, and let her\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n“Now I don’t know what happened to the others, but I know what I did.  I\r\ngot turned about.  Did you ever stem a strawberry and throw the\r\nstrawberry away and pop the stem into your mouth?  That’s what I did.  I\r\nthrew the fire-stick into the water after the mullet and held on to the\r\ndynamite.  And my arm went off with the stick when it went off. . . . ”\r\n\r\nSlim investigated the tomato-can for water to mix himself a drink, but\r\nfound it empty.  He stood up.\r\n\r\n“Heigh ho,” he yawned, and started down the path to the river.\r\n\r\nIn several minutes he was back.  He mixed the due quantity of river slush\r\nwith the alcohol, took a long, solitary drink, and stared with bitter\r\nmoodiness into the fire.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but . . . ” Fatty suggested.  “What happened then?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” sad Slim.  “Then the princess married me, of course.”\r\n\r\n“But you were the only person left, and there wasn’t any princess . . . ”\r\nWhiskers cried out abruptly, and then let his voice trail away to\r\nembarrassed silence.\r\n\r\nSlim stared unblinkingly into the fire.\r\n\r\nPercival Delaney and Chauncey Delarouse looked at each other.  Quietly,\r\nin solemn silence, each with his one arm aided the one arm of the other\r\nin rolling and tying his bundle.  And in silence, bundles slung on\r\nshoulders, they went away out of the circle of firelight.  Not until they\r\nreached the top of the railroad embankment did they speak.\r\n\r\n“No gentleman would have done it,” said Whiskers.\r\n\r\n“No gentleman would have done it,” Fatty agreed.\r\n\r\n                                 THE END\r\n\r\nGlen Ellen, California,\r\n      _September_ 26, 1916.",
