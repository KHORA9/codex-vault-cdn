Thus it has been found\r\npossible to combine much biographical interest with sketches of his most\r\nimportant works. Like other biographers of Darwin, I am much indebted to\r\nMr. Woodall's valuable memoir, contributed to the Transactions of the\r\nShropshire Archæological Society. But original authorities have been\r\nconsulted throughout, and the first editions of Darwin's books quoted,\r\nunless the contrary is explicitly stated. I am greatly obliged to\r\nMessrs. F. Darwin and G. J. Romanes for kindly permitting me to quote\r\nfrom Mr. Darwin's letters to Mr. Romanes. I must also express my thanks\r\nto my friends, Mr. Romanes and Prof. D'Arcy W. Thompson, for doing me\r\nthe great service of looking over the proof-sheets of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf ever a man's ancestors transmitted to him ability to succeed in a\r\nparticular field, Charles Darwin's did. If ever early surroundings were\r\ncalculated to call out inherited ability, Charles Darwin's were. If ever\r\na man grew up when a ferment of thought was disturbing old convictions\r\nin the domain of knowledge for which he was adapted, Charles Darwin did.\r\nIf ever a man was fitted by worldly position to undertake unbiassed and\r\nlong-continued investigations, Charles Darwin was such a man. And he\r\nindisputably found realms waiting for a conqueror. Yet Darwin's\r\nachievements far transcend his advantages of ancestry, surroundings,\r\nprevious suggestion, position. He stands magnificently conspicuous as a\r\ngenius of rare simplicity of soul, of unwearied patience of observation,\r\nof striking fertility and ingenuity of method, of unflinching devotion\r\nto and belief in the efficacy of truth. He revolutionised not merely\r\nhalf-a-dozen sciences, but the whole current of thinking men's mental\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe Darwins were originally a Lincolnshire family of some position, and\r\nbeing royalists suffered heavy losses under the Commonwealth. The third\r\nWilliam Darwin (born 1655), whose mother was a daughter of Erasmus\r\nEarle, serjeant-at-law,[1] married the heiress of Robert Waring, of\r\nWilsford, Notts, who also inherited the manor of Elston, near Newark, in\r\nthat county, which still remains in the family. Robert Darwin, second\r\nson of this William Darwin, succeeded to the Elston estate, and was\r\ndescribed by Stukeley, the antiquary, as \"a person of curiosity,\" an\r\nexpression conveying high commendation. His eldest son, Robert Waring\r\nDarwin, studied botany closely, and published a \"Principia Botanica,\"\r\nwhich reached a third edition; but his youngest son, Erasmus, born 1731,\r\nwas destined to become the first really famous man of the family.\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin's personal characteristics, his medical talents, and his\r\npoetic writings were such as to overshadow, for his own generation, his\r\nscientific merit. We have not space here to describe his career and his\r\nworks, which has been so well done by his grandson, and by Ernst Krause\r\n(\"Erasmus Darwin,\" 1879). Horace Walpole regarded his description of\r\ncreation in \"The Botanic Garden\" (part i., canto 1, lines 103-114) as\r\nthe most sublime passage in any language he knew: and _The Edinburgh\r\nReview_ (vol. ii., 1803, p. 501) says of his \"Temple of Nature\": \"If his\r\nfame be destined in anything to outlive the fluctuating fashion of the\r\nday, it is on his merit as a poet that it is likely to rest; and his\r\nreveries in science have probably no other chance of being saved from\r\noblivion but by having been 'married to immortal verse.'\"\r\n\r\nThe present age regards it as next to impossible to write science in\r\npoetry; although few have succeeded better in the attempt than Erasmus\r\nDarwin. It is singular that he should have partially anticipated his\r\nillustrious grandson's theories, but without supporting them by\r\nexperimental proof or by deep scientific knowledge. Suffice it to say\r\nnow, that Erasmus contemplated to a great extent the same domain of\r\nscience as Charles Darwin, having also a mechanical turn; and was\r\neducated at Edinburgh and Cambridge. His observations on Providence in\r\n1754, when only twenty-three, in commenting on his father's death, are\r\nvery interesting to compare with his grandson's attitude: \"That there\r\nexists a superior Ens Entium, which formed these wonderful creatures, is\r\na mathematical demonstration. That He influences things by a particular\r\nprovidence is not so evident. The probability, according to my notion,\r\nis against it, since general laws seem sufficient for that end.... The\r\nlight of Nature affords us not a single argument for a future state:\r\nthis is the only one, that it is possible with God, since He who made us\r\nout of nothing can surely re-create us; and that He will do this we\r\nhumbly hope.\" He published an ode against atheism, with which he has\r\nstrangely enough often been charged, beginning--\r\n\r\n          \"Dull atheist, could a giddy dance\r\n             Of atoms lawless hurl'd\r\n           Construct so wonderful, so wise,\r\n             So harmonised a world?\"\r\n\r\nand his moral standpoint is shown by the declaration that \"the sacred\r\nmaxims of the author of Christianity, 'Do as you would be done by,' and\r\n'Love your neighbour as yourself,' include all our duties of benevolence\r\nand morality; and if sincerely obeyed by all nations, would a\r\nthousandfold multiply the present happiness of mankind\" (\"Temple of\r\nNature,\" 1803, p. 124). His principal poetical writings were \"The\r\nBotanic Garden,\" in two parts; Part I. containing \"The Economy of\r\nVegetation,\" first published in 1790; and Part II., \"The Loves of the\r\nPlants,\" in 1788, before the first part had appeared. \"The Temple of\r\nNature, or the Origin of Society,\" was published after his death, in\r\n1803. His chief prose works are \"Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life,\"\r\nin two volumes, 1794-6, the second volume being exclusively medical; and\r\n\"Phytologia, or the Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening,\" 1800. All\r\nthese books are in quarto, with plates. His views on species are\r\nreferred to on pages 66 and 67. [Transcriber's Note: Footnote 6.]\r\n\r\nRobert Waring Darwin, third son of Erasmus by his first wife, Mary\r\nHoward, was born in 1766. As a boy he was brought much into association\r\nwith the Wedgwoods of Stoke, Josiah Wedgwood being one of Erasmus\r\nDarwin's most intimate friends. In 1779 Robert, already destined to be a\r\ndoctor, stayed at Etruria for some time, sharing with Wedgwood's\r\nchildren in Warltire's private chemical instruction; and Josiah Wedgwood\r\nwrote at this time: \"The boys drink in knowledge like water, with great\r\navidity.\" Before he was twenty Robert Darwin had taken his medical\r\ndegree with distinction at Edinburgh, where he had the advantage of the\r\nlectures of Black, Cullen, and Gregory, and had also studied at Leyden,\r\nand travelled in Germany. In 1786 his father set him up in practice at\r\nShrewsbury, leaving him with twenty pounds, which was afterwards\r\nsupplemented by a similar sum from his uncle, John Darwin, Rector of\r\nElston. On this slender capital he contrived to establish himself, in\r\nspite of severe competition; and his burly form and countenance, as he\r\nsat in his invariable yellow chaise, became well known to every man,\r\nwoman, and child around Shrewsbury for many miles. Before long, no one\r\nthought of sending to Birmingham for a consultant, and Dr. Darwin was\r\nfor many years the leading Shropshire physician, and accumulated an\r\nabundant fortune.\r\n\r\nAccording to his son Charles, Robert Darwin \"did not inherit any\r\naptitude for poetry or mechanics, nor did he possess, as I think, a\r\nscientific mind. He published, in vol. lxxvi. of the 'Philosophical\r\nTransactions,' a paper on Ocular Spectra, which Wheatstone told me was a\r\nremarkable production for the period; but I believe that he was largely\r\naided in writing it by his father. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety in 1788. I cannot tell why my father's mind did not appear to me\r\nfitted for advancing science, for he was fond of theorising, and was\r\nincomparably the most acute observer whom I ever knew. But his powers in\r\nthis direction were exercised almost wholly in the practice of medicine\r\nand in the observation of human character. He intuitively recognised the\r\ndisposition or character, and even read the thoughts, of those with whom\r\nhe came into contact, with extraordinary astuteness. This skill partly\r\naccounts for his great success as a physician, for it impressed his\r\npatients with belief in him; and my father used to say that the art of\r\ngaining confidence was the chief element in a doctor's worldly success.\"\r\n\r\nSensitive, sociable, a good talker, high-spirited and somewhat\r\nirascible, a man who admitted no one to his friendship whom he could not\r\nthoroughly respect, the friend of the poor, prescribing gratuitously to\r\nall who were needy, pre-eminent for sympathy, which for a time made him\r\nhate his profession for the constant suffering it brought before his\r\neyes--such was Charles Darwin's father. Miss Meteyard, in her \"Group of\r\nEnglishmen,\" 1871, gives a vivid picture of the old doctor, his\r\nacknowledged supremacy in Shrewsbury, his untiring activity and\r\nubiquity, his great dinner parties, his liberal and rather unpopular\r\nopinions, tolerated for the sake of his success in curing his patients.\r\nHis face, powerful, unimpassioned, mild, and thoughtful, was always the\r\nsame as he rolled through the streets and lanes, for he sat \"as though\r\ncarved in stone.\" His love of children was marked. \"He would address\r\nthem in his small, high-pitched falsetto voice, and if their answers\r\npleased him he would reply; and occasionally, lifting them on to a chair\r\nor table, he would measure their heads with his broad hand, as though\r\nreading character, and mentally prognosticating their future fate.\"\r\n\r\nThe successful doctor bought a piece of land near the Holyhead road, and\r\nbuilt on it a large square house, of plain architecture, which from its\r\ncharming position, a hundred feet above the Severn, received the name\r\nof \"The Mount.\"[2] Having thus provided the nest, in 1796 he brought\r\nhome his wife, Susannah Wedgwood, eldest daughter of the celebrated\r\npotter, to whom he was married at Marylebone Church on April 18th.\r\n\r\nThe character and education of Charles Darwin's mother is a matter of\r\nconsiderable interest, notwithstanding that her death when he was only\r\neight years old cut short her opportunities of influencing him. She was\r\nborn at Burslem in January, 1765, and a year after her father describes\r\nher as a \"fine, sprightly lass:\" she became his best-beloved child. She\r\nwas partly educated in London, under the eye of her father's partner,\r\nthe accomplished Thomas Bentley, in whose heart she won as tender a\r\nplace as in her father's. Later she continued her education at home with\r\nher brothers, under good tuition. Many visits were exchanged between the\r\nDarwins and the Wedgwoods, and old Erasmus Darwin became very fond of\r\nMiss Wedgwood. By the time of her marriage she was matured by much\r\nintercourse with notable people, as well as by extensive reading, and\r\nfrom her experience of London society and varied travel in England was\r\nwell fitted to shine as the county doctor's wife. From her father, who\r\ndied in 1795, she had doubtless inherited, in addition to a handsome\r\nfortune, many valuable faculties, and probably she transmitted more of\r\nthem to her son Charles than she herself manifested. Josiah Wedgwood,\r\nover whose career it would be delightful to linger, is well described by\r\nMiss Meteyard in words which might be precisely applied to Charles\r\nDarwin, as \"patient, stedfast, humble, simple, unconscious of half his\r\nown greatness, and yet by this very simplicity, patience, and\r\nstedfastness displaying the high quality of his moral and intellectual\r\ncharacteristics, even whilst insuring that each step was in the right\r\ndirection, and firmly planted.\" A truly experimental genius in artistic\r\nmanufacture, Wedgwood foreshadowed a far greater experimental genius in\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nBefore her famous son was born, however, Mrs. Darwin's health had begun\r\nto fail, and in 1807 she wrote to a friend: \"Every one seems young but\r\nme.\" Her second son (four daughters having preceded him) was born at The\r\nMount on February 12, 1809, and christened \"Charles Robert,\" at St.\r\nChad's Church, Shrewsbury, on November 17th following. No doubt her\r\ndeclining health emphasised her attachment to home pursuits, to quiet\r\nreading, to the luxuriant garden, and to her numerous domestic pets. The\r\nbeauty, variety, and lameness of The Mount pigeons was well known in the\r\ntown and far beyond. Mr. Woodall states that one of Darwin's\r\nschoolfellows, the Rev. W. A. Leighton, remembers him plucking a plant\r\nand recalling one of his mother's elementary lessons in botany. Too soon\r\nhowever the mother was taken from The Mount; she died in July, 1817,\r\nwhen Charles was between eight and nine years old.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of Dr. Robert Darwin, on whom the grandfather's name of\r\nErasmus had been bestowed, is notable as the intimate friend of the\r\nCarlyles. \"He had something of original and sarcastically ingenious in\r\nhim,\" says Carlyle, in his \"Reminiscences,\" \"one of the sincerest,\r\nnaturally truest, and most modest of men.... E. Darwin it was who named\r\nthe late Whewell, seeing him sit, all ear (not all assent), at some of\r\nmy lectures, 'The Harmonious Blacksmith.' My dear one had a great favour\r\nfor this honest Darwin always; many a road to shops, and the like, he\r\ndrove her in his cab, in those early days when even the charge of\r\nomnibuses was a consideration, and his sparse utterances, sardonic\r\noften, were a great amusement to her. 'A perfect gentleman,' she at once\r\ndiscerned him to be, and of sound worth and kindliness, in the most\r\nunaffected form.\" He died in 1881, aged 77, leaving no memorial to the\r\npublic of his undoubtedly great abilities. Like his younger brother, he\r\nwas a member of Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.B., in\r\n1828.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1817, the closing year of his mother's life, Charles Darwin was\r\nplaced at school with the Rev. George Case, minister of the Shrewsbury\r\nUnitarian church, to which the Darwins were attached, in this resembling\r\nthe Wedgwoods. At midsummer, 1818, however, the boy entered Shrewsbury\r\nGrammar School, then under Samuel Butler, afterwards Bishop of\r\nLichfield. Classics, as ever, formed the staple of the instruction there\r\nafforded, and proved but little to the future naturalist's taste.\r\nUnfortunately for the repute of English schools, Charles Darwin was\r\nlittle benefited by his schooling; and Euclid, then an extra subject,\r\nconstituted, to his mind, the only bit of real education Shrewsbury\r\nschool gave him. Seventy years later, the study of mother earth and her\r\nteeming productions, which Darwin made so attractive, is still but\r\nscantily represented in the instruction afforded by our great schools.\r\n\r\nThus out of sympathy with the prevalent studies, the youth showed no\r\nfondness for his schoolfellows' sports. He was reserved, frequently lost\r\nin thought, and fond of long solitary rambles, according to one\r\nschoolfellow, the Rev. W. A. Leighton; another, the Rev. John Yardley,\r\nVicar of St. Chad's, Shrewsbury, remembers him as cheerful,\r\ngood-tempered, and communicative. One of the recorded incidents of his\r\nboyish days is a fall from the old Shrewsbury wall, while walking in a\r\n\"brown study.\" Even at this early period he was fond of collecting\r\nobjects which many schoolboys delight in, such as shells and minerals,\r\nseals, franks, and coins; and the mechanical aptitude derived from both\r\nthe Darwins and the Wedgwoods was manifested by keen interest in\r\nmechanism. One especially remembered youthful treat was when his uncle\r\nJosiah Wedgwood explained to him the principle of the vernier. No doubt\r\nthe pigeons, the exotics, the shrubs and flowers of his father's grounds\r\nimpressed themselves indelibly on the boy's mind and unconsciously\r\nprepared him for his future. Schooldays were for him fortunately not\r\nprotracted, for in 1825, at the age of sixteen, he went to Edinburgh\r\nUniversity, where his father and grandfather had likewise studied, with\r\nthe idea of devoting himself to medicine. The youth of sixteen was well\r\nequipped with the results of long thinking and observing rather than\r\nwith book-learning, and was prepared to play an independent part without\r\nnoise and show, assimilating that which commended itself to his mind,\r\nand rejecting that which found no appropriate soil in him, in a manner\r\ncharacteristic of genuine originality.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1: This is the Erasmus Earle who forms the subject of \"A\r\nLawyer's Love Letters,\" in _The National Review_, February, 1887.\r\nLetters of his are also printed in the Tenth Report of the Historical\r\nMSS. Commission.]\r\n\r\n[2: \"The house is seen,\" says Mr. Woodall, \"from the line\r\nimmediately beyond the low tower of St. George's Church. Visitors who\r\nmake a pilgrimage there, after crossing the Welsh Bridge, follow the\r\nmain street until St. George's Church is passed, and the continuous line\r\nof houses ceases. The next carriage drive, on the right, cutting in two\r\na lofty side-walk, is the entrance to The Mount. A short street of new\r\nhouses, near St. George's Church, has been called 'Darwin Street;' as\r\nyet the only public recognition in the town of the greatest of\r\nSalopians. A memorial of a more private character has been placed in the\r\nUnitarian Chapel, in the form of a tablet bearing the following\r\ninscription:--'To the memory of Charles Robert Darwin, author of \"The\r\nOrigin of Species,\" born in Shrewsbury, February 12th, 1809. In early\r\nlife a member and constant worshipper in this church. Died April 19th,\r\n1882.' Mrs. Darwin, we believe, was not strict in her adhesion to the\r\ncommunion in which she had been brought up, but often attended St.\r\nChad's Church, where Charles and his brother were baptized.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Darwin went to Edinburgh, the university was not in one of\r\nits palmiest periods. The medical professors failed to attract him to\r\ntheir profession, and two years of Edinburgh satisfied him that medicine\r\nshould not absorb him. With natural history the case was different. Its\r\nattractiveness for Darwin increased. He found congenial companionship in\r\nthe Edinburgh Plinian Society, and Mr. W. F. Ainsworth relates (in _The\r\nAthenæum_, May 13, 1882) that Darwin and himself made frequent\r\nexcursions on the shores of the Firth of Forth in pursuit of objects of\r\nnatural history, sometimes visiting the coasts of Fifeshire, and\r\nsometimes the islands off the coast. On one occasion, accompanied by Dr.\r\nGreville, the botanist, they went to the Isle of May, and were both\r\nexceedingly amused at the effect produced upon the eminent author of the\r\nScottish Cryptogamic Flora by the screeching of the kittiwakes and other\r\nwater-fowl. He had actually to lie down on the greensward to enjoy his\r\nprolonged cachinnation. On another occasion the young naturalists were\r\nbenighted on Inch Keith, but found refuge in the lighthouse.\r\n\r\nDarwin was now not merely a collector and exploring naturalist, but he\r\nobserved biological facts of importance. On the 27th of March, 1827, he\r\nmade a communication to the Plinian Society on the ova, or rather larvæ,\r\nof the Flustra or sea-mat, a member of the class Polyzoa, forming a\r\ncontinuous mat-like colony of thousands of organisms leading a\r\njoint-stock existence. He announced that he had discovered in these\r\nlarvæ organs of locomotion, then so seldom, now so frequently, known to\r\nexist on such bodies. At the same time, he made known that the small\r\nblack body which until that time had been mistaken for the young state\r\nof a species of seaweed, was in reality the egg of _Pontobdella\r\nmuricata_, a sort of sea-leech. On the 3rd of April following, the\r\ndiscoverer exhibited specimens of the latter creature with eggs and\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nIn making these researches, Darwin was no doubt stimulated and aided by\r\nthe teaching of Dr. Grant, afterwards Professor of Natural History at\r\nUniversity College, London, who was then at Edinburgh, making\r\ndiscoveries in the structure of sponges. Professor Jameson, too, who was\r\nthen forming his splendid museum of natural history, cannot fail to have\r\ninfluenced Darwin somewhat; and we find that the first lecture of the\r\nconcluding portion of Jameson's zoological course, dealing with \"The\r\nPhilosophy of Zoology,\" had the suggestive title of \"The Origin of the\r\nSpecies of Animals.\" Thus we must acknowledge that already at Edinburgh\r\nDarwin was fairly started in the paths of zoological inquiry, and the\r\nnorthern university must be admitted to share with Cambridge, the\r\ndistinction of being the foster-parent of this giant-child.\r\n\r\nMedicine being distasteful, Edinburgh had no other distinctive charms to\r\noffer to young Darwin, and he was entered at Christ's College,\r\nCambridge, early in 1828, with the idea of his becoming a clergyman of\r\nthe Church of England. It might have been thought that there was scant\r\nstimulus for a biological student in the Cambridge of that period; but\r\nalthough the old literary and mathematical studies were still the only\r\npaths to a degree, there were men of original force and genius at work\r\npreparing the ground for a coming revolution. Sedgwick was teaching\r\ngeology with the fire of a prophet, and Henslow as a botanist was\r\nshowing that lessons of enthralling interest were to be learned from the\r\nhumblest flower. Henslow especially attracted young Darwin, who never\r\nforgot his old teacher. In the preface to the journal of his voyage in\r\nthe _Beagle_ he returns his most sincere thanks to Professor Henslow,\r\n\"who,\" he says, \"when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge, was one chief\r\nmeans of giving me a taste for natural history; who, during my absence,\r\ntook charge of the collections I sent home, and by his correspondence\r\ndirected my endeavours--and who, since my return, has constantly\r\nrendered me every assistance which the kindest friend could offer.\"\r\n\r\nNo better idea of Darwin's Cambridge days can be given than that which\r\nis derived from reading his account of Professor Henslow, contributed to\r\nthe Rev. L. Jenyns's \"Memoirs\" of that accomplished man. There can be no\r\ndoubt, also, that in thus pourtraying the character of another, he was\r\nat the same time, as Mr. Romanes puts it, \"unconsciously giving a most\r\naccurate description of his own.\"\r\n\r\n\"I went to Cambridge,\" wrote Darwin, \"early in the year 1828, and soon\r\nbecame acquainted, through some of my brother entomologists,[3] with\r\nProfessor Henslow, for all who cared for any branch of natural history\r\nwere equally encouraged by him. Nothing could be more simple, cordial,\r\nand unpretending than the encouragement which he afforded to all young\r\nnaturalists. I soon became intimate with him, for he had a remarkable\r\npower of making the young feel completely at ease with him; though we\r\nwere all awe-struck with the amount of his knowledge. Before I saw him I\r\nheard one young man sum up his attainments by simply saying that he knew\r\neverything. When I reflect how immediately we felt at perfect ease with\r\na man older and in every way so immensely our superior, I think it was\r\nas much owing to the transparent sincerity of his character, as to his\r\nkindness of heart, and, perhaps, even still more to a highly remarkable\r\nabsence in him of all self-consciousness. One perceived at once that he\r\nnever thought of his own varied knowledge or clear intellect, but solely\r\non the subject in hand. Another charm, which must have struck every one,\r\nwas that his manner to old and distinguished persons and to the youngest\r\nstudent was exactly the same: to all he showed the most winning\r\ncourtesy. He would receive with interest the most trifling observation\r\nin any branch of natural history, and however absurd a blunder one might\r\nmake, he pointed it out so clearly and kindly, that one left him in no\r\nway disheartened, but only determined to be more accurate the next time.\r\nIn short, no man could be better formed to win the entire confidence of\r\nthe young, and to encourage them in their pursuits.\r\n\r\n\"His lectures on botany were universally popular, and as clear as\r\ndaylight. So popular were they, that several of the older members of the\r\nuniversity attended successive courses. Once every week he kept open\r\nhouse in the evening, and all who cared for natural history attended\r\nthese parties, which, by thus favouring intercommunication, did the same\r\ngood in Cambridge, in a very pleasant manner, as the scientific\r\nsocieties do in London. At these parties many of the most distinguished\r\nmembers of the university occasionally attended; and when only a few\r\nwere present, I have listened to the great men of those days conversing\r\non all sorts of subjects, with the most varied and brilliant powers.\r\nThis was no small advantage to some of the younger men, as it stimulated\r\ntheir mental activity and ambition. Two or three times in each session\r\nhe took excursions with his botanical class, either a long walk to the\r\nhabitat of some rare plant, or in a barge down the river to the fens, or\r\nin coaches to some more distant place, as to Gamlingay, to see the wild\r\nlily-of-the-valley, and to catch on the heath the rare natter-jack.\r\nThese excursions have left a delightful impression on my mind. He was,\r\non such occasions, in as good spirits as a boy, and laughed as heartily\r\nas a boy at the misadventures of those who chased the splendid\r\nswallow-tail butterflies across the broken and treacherous fens. He used\r\nto pause every now and then and lecture on some plant or other object;\r\nand something he could tell us on every insect, shell, or fossil\r\ncollected, for he had attended to every branch of natural history. After\r\nour day's work we used to dine at some inn or house, and most jovial we\r\nthen were. I believe all who joined these excursions will agree with me\r\nthat they have left an enduring impression of delight on our minds.\r\n\r\n\"As time passed on at Cambridge I became very intimate with Professor\r\nHenslow, and his kindness was unbounded; he continually asked me to his\r\nhouse, and allowed me to accompany him in his walks. He talked on all\r\nsubjects, including his deep sense of religion, and was entirely open. I\r\nowe more than I can express to this excellent man. His kindness was\r\nsteady. When Captain Fitzroy offered to give up part of his own cabin to\r\nany naturalist who would join the expedition in H.M.S. _Beagle_,\r\nProfessor Henslow recommended me as one who knew very little, but who,\r\nhe thought, would work. I was strongly attached to natural history, and\r\nthis attachment I owed in large part to him. During the five years'\r\nvoyage he regularly corresponded with me, and guided my efforts; he\r\nreceived, opened, and took care of all the specimens sent home in many\r\nlarge boxes; but I firmly believe that, during these five years, it\r\nnever once crossed his mind that he was acting towards me with unusual\r\nand generous kindness.\r\n\r\n\"During the years when I associated so much with Professor Henslow I\r\nnever once saw his temper even ruffled. He never took an ill-natured\r\nview of any one's character, though very far from blind to the foibles\r\nof others. It always struck me that his mind could not be even touched\r\nby any paltry feeling of vanity, envy, or jealousy. With all this\r\nequability of temper and remarkable benevolence, there was no insipidity\r\nof character. A man must have been blind not to have perceived that\r\nbeneath this placid exterior there was a vigorous and determined will.\r\nWhen principle came into play no power on earth could have turned him\r\none hair's breadth....\r\n\r\n\"In intellect, as far as I could judge, accurate powers of observation,\r\nsound sense, and cautious judgment seemed predominant. Nothing seemed to\r\ngive him so much enjoyment as drawing conclusions from minute\r\nobservations. But his admirable memoir on the geology of Anglesea shows\r\nhis capacity for extended observations and broad views. Reflecting over\r\nhis character with gratitude and reverence, his moral attributes rise,\r\nas they should do in the highest character, in pre-eminence over his\r\nintellect.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man's modesty is conspicuous in the above narrative. He does\r\nnot see how his own transparent candour, his desire to learn, his\r\nrespect for those who were already masters of science, won upon the\r\ngreat men with whom he came in contact. It was by no means as \"one who\r\nknew very little\" that Henslow recommended Darwin to Captain Fitzroy,\r\nbut as \"a young man of promising ability, extremely fond of geology, and\r\nindeed all branches of natural history.\" \"In consequence,\" says Fitzroy,\r\n\"an offer was made to Mr. Darwin to be my guest on board, which he\r\naccepted conditionally. Permission was obtained for his embarkation, and\r\nan order given by the Admiralty that he should be borne on the ship's\r\nbooks for provisions. The conditions asked by Mr. Darwin were, that he\r\nshould be at liberty to leave the _Beagle_ and retire from the\r\nexpedition when he thought proper, and that he should pay a fair share\r\nof the expenses of my table.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin had taken an ordinary or \"poll\" degree in 1831 and was admitted a\r\nMaster of Arts in 1837. In the interval he had become truly a Master of\r\nScience, which at that time was adequately recognised by no university\r\nin the British dominions. The memorable voyage of the _Beagle_, a little\r\nbarque of 242 tons, was at first delayed by heavy gales which twice\r\ndrove her back; but she finally sailed from Devonport on December 27,\r\n1831. The object of the expedition was to complete the survey of\r\nPatagonia and Tierra del Fuego, to survey the shores of Chili, Peru, and\r\nsome Pacific Islands, and to carry a chain of chronometrical\r\nmeasurements round the world.\r\n\r\nProfessor Henslow's interest in his young pupil's progress is shown by\r\nthe fact that in 1835 (December 1) he printed some extracts from his\r\nletters, for distribution among the members of the Cambridge\r\nPhilosophical Society, in consequence of the notice excited by some\r\ngeological observations they contained, which had been read before the\r\nsociety on the 16th of November previous. The following points having a\r\npersonal reference to the traveller may be quoted. On August 15, 1832,\r\nDarwin wrote from Monte Video, \"I might collect a far greater number of\r\nspecimens of invertebrate animals if I took up less time over each: but\r\nI have come to the conclusion that two animals with their original\r\ncolour and shape noted down will be more valuable to naturalists than\r\nsix with only dates and place.\" Here we see the accuracy which was the\r\nsource of much of his after-success. On November 24, 1832, he writes\r\nfrom the same place, \"As for one little toad, I hope it may be new, that\r\nit may be christened 'Diabolicus.' Milton must allude to this very\r\nindividual, when he talks of 'squat like a toad.'\" In March, 1834,\r\nwriting from East Falkland Island, he says, \"The whole of the east coast\r\nof the southern part of South America has been elevated from the ocean\r\nsince a period during which mussels have not lost their blue colour.\"\r\nDescribing his examination of the central peaks of the Andes in Chili,\r\nhe says, April 18, 1835, \"I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed some of\r\nthese views; it is worth coming from England, once to feel such intense\r\ndelight. At an elevation of from ten to twelve thousand feet, there is a\r\ntransparency in the air, and a confusion of distances, and a sort of\r\nstillness, which give the sensation of being in another world.\"\r\n\r\nComing now to Darwin's Journal as first published in 1839, forming the\r\nthird volume of Fitzroy's narrative, the 7th of January, 1832, on which\r\nthe Peak of Teneriffe was seen suddenly illumined, while the lower parts\r\nwere veiled in fleecy clouds, is noted as \"the first of many delightful\r\ndays never to be forgotten.\" On the 16th the Cape de Verde Islands were\r\nreached, and their volcanic geology was carefully explored. Darwin was\r\nalready equipped with the first volume of Lyell's famous \"Principles of\r\nGeology,\" published in 1830, the second following in 1832; and in the\r\nsecond edition of his journal, published in 1845, he acknowledges with\r\ngrateful pleasure \"that the chief part of whatever scientific merit this\r\njournal and the other works of the author may possess, has been derived\r\nfrom studying the well-known and admirable 'Principles of Geology.'\" He\r\nwas already noting the diffusion of minute organisms and impalpable dust\r\nby winds,[4] and was much surprised to find in some dust collected on a\r\nvessel 300 miles from land particles of stone more than a thousandth of\r\nan inch square. After this, he remarks, one need not be surprised at the\r\ndiffusion of the far lighter and smaller sporules of cryptogamous\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic island of St. Paul in the open Atlantic was touched at on\r\nFebruary 16th, and it afforded the young naturalist a text for\r\ndestroying the pretty ideas as to stately palms and birds taking\r\npossession of newly-formed oceanic land; at any rate, here were only two\r\nspecies of sea birds, no plants, and the fauna was completed by a number\r\nof insects and spiders of no very exalted habits. Fernando Noronha was\r\npassed on February 20th, and at last the South American continent was\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nOn February 29th, at Bahia, Darwin describes his first day in a\r\nBrazilian forest, in a passage which is of special interest. \"The day\r\nhas passed delightfully. Delight itself, however, is a weak term to\r\nexpress the feelings of a naturalist who, for the first time, has\r\nwandered by himself in a Brazilian forest. The elegance of the grasses,\r\nthe novelty of the parasitical plants, the beauty of the flowers, the\r\nglossy green of the foliage, but, above all, the general luxuriance of\r\nthe vegetation, filled me with admiration. A most paradoxical mixture of\r\nsound and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood. The noise from\r\nthe insects is so loud that it may be heard even in a vessel anchored\r\nseveral hundred yards from the shore; yet within the recesses of the\r\nforest a universal silence appears to reign. To a person fond of natural\r\nhistory, such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure than he can\r\never hope to experience again.\"\r\n\r\nArriving at Rio de Janeiro early in April, Darwin made several\r\nexcursions into the interior during the following three months. On these\r\nexpeditions it was rarely indeed that decent accommodation could be\r\nprocured at the inns. \"On first arriving,\" he says, \"it was our custom\r\nto unsaddle the horses and give them their Indian corn; then, with a low\r\nbow, to ask the senhor to do us the favour to give us something to eat.\r\n'Anything you choose, sir,' was his usual answer. For the few first\r\ntimes, vainly I thanked Providence for having guided us to so good a\r\nman. The conversation proceeding, the case universally became\r\ndeplorable. 'Any fish can you do us the favour of giving?' 'Oh, no,\r\nsir!' 'Any soup?' 'No, sir!' 'Any bread?' 'Oh, no, sir!' 'Any dried\r\nmeat?' 'Oh, no, sir!' If we were lucky, by waiting a couple of hours, we\r\nobtained fowls, rice, and farinha. It not unfrequently happened that we\r\nwere obliged to kill, with stones, the poultry for our own supper. When,\r\nthoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger, we timorously hinted that we\r\nshould be glad of our meal, the pompous and (though true) most\r\nunsatisfactory answer was, 'It will be ready when it is ready!' If we\r\nhad dared to remonstrate any further, we should have been told to\r\nproceed on our journey, as being too impertinent. The hosts are most\r\nungracious and disagreeable in their manners; their houses and their\r\npersons are often filthily dirty; the want of the accommodation of\r\nforks, knives, and spoons is common; and I am sure no cottage or hovel\r\nin England could be found in a state so utterly destitute of every\r\ncomfort.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we add to these discomforts on land the fact that the young\r\ntraveller was a constant sufferer from sea-sickness and nausea, which\r\nbecame chronic, it becomes more surprising that he should not have\r\nwithdrawn early from his adventurous course. But his energy and\r\nresolution were equal to any drafts upon them, and the delights of the\r\nstudy of nature outweighed all physical discomforts. Admiral J. Lort\r\nStokes in a letter to _The Times_, after the death of his old friend\r\nand comrade in the _Beagle_, described how after perhaps an hour's work\r\nhe would say, \"Old fellow, I must take the horizontal for it.\" Then he\r\nwould stretch himself on one side of the table, and obtain a brief\r\nrelief from discomfort, after which he would resume work.\r\n\r\nSome remarks which Darwin makes upon slavery in South America are very\r\nforcible, and also illustrate his own sympathetic nature. Here is one\r\nincident which struck him more than any story of cruelty, as showing the\r\ndegradation of slavery. \"I was crossing a ferry with a negro, who was\r\nuncommonly stupid. In endeavouring to make him understand, I talked\r\nloud, and made signs, in doing which I passed my hand near his face. He,\r\nI suppose, thought I was in a passion, and was going to strike him; for\r\ninstantly, with a frightened look and half-shut eyes, he dropped his\r\nhands. I shall never forget my feelings of surprise, disgust, and shame,\r\nat seeing a great powerful man afraid even to ward off a blow, directed,\r\nas he thought, at his face. This man had been trained to a degradation\r\nlower than the slavery of the most helpless animal.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of the numerous additions to the second issue of the Journal in\r\n1845, Darwin speaks thus eloquently from his heart: \"On the 19th of\r\nAugust [1836], we finally left the shores of Brazil. I thank God I shall\r\nnever again visit a slave-country. To this day, if I hear a distant\r\nscream, it recalls with painful vividness my feelings when, passing a\r\nhouse near Pernambuco, I heard the most pitiable moans, and could not\r\nbut suspect that some poor slave was being tortured, yet knew that I\r\nwas as powerless as a child, even to remonstrate. I suspected that these\r\nmoans were from a tortured slave, for I was told that this was the case\r\nin another instance. Near Rio de Janeiro I lived opposite to an old\r\nlady, who kept screws to crush the fingers of her female slaves. I have\r\nstayed in a house where a young household mulatto, daily and hourly, was\r\nreviled, beaten, and persecuted enough to break the spirit of the lowest\r\nanimal. I have seen a little boy, six or seven years old, struck thrice\r\nwith a horse-whip (before I could interfere) on his naked head, for\r\nhaving handed me a glass of water not quite clean; I saw his father\r\ntremble at a mere glance from his master's eye.... I will not even\r\nallude to the many heart-sickening atrocities which I authentically\r\nheard of; nor would I have mentioned the above revolting details, had I\r\nnot met with several people, so blinded by the constitutional gaiety of\r\nthe negro, as to speak of slavery as a tolerable evil.... Those who look\r\ntenderly at the slave-owner, and with a cold heart at the slave, never\r\nseem to put themselves into the position of the latter. What a cheerless\r\nprospect, with not even a hope of change! Picture to yourself the\r\nchance, ever hanging over you, of your wife and your little\r\nchildren--those objects which nature urges even the slave to call his\r\nown--being torn from you, and sold like beasts to the first bidder! And\r\nthese deeds are done and palliated by men who profess to love their\r\nneighbours as themselves, who believe in God, and pray that His will be\r\ndone on earth!\"\r\n\r\nSuch burning expressions are not yet superfluous, and it is wholesome to\r\nrecall to a generation which scarcely realises the past miseries of\r\nslavery, and is too apt to rest content with what has been accomplished\r\nin diminishing the sufferings of slaves, white and black, the impression\r\nproduced on a scientific man by what he saw. It is well, too, that it\r\nshould be brought forcibly home to Englishmen that Darwin's heart was no\r\nless sympathetic than his intelligence was far-seeing, and that the\r\ntestimony of friends of late years to his moral grandeur is corroborated\r\nby the personal records of his years of travel.\r\n\r\nThe variety and interest of the observations made during his stay at\r\nRio, when tropical nature was still a fresh and unexplored page to the\r\nyoung observer, are wonderful. Cabbage palms, liana creepers, luxuriant\r\nfern leaves--roads, bridges, and soil--planarian worms, frogs which\r\nclimbed perpendicular sheets of glass, the light of fireflies, brilliant\r\nbutterflies, fights between spiders and wasps, the victories of ants\r\nover difficulties, the habits of monkeys, the little Brazilian boys\r\npractising knife-throwing--all these came in turn under his watchful\r\neyes and are vividly described.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1832, Monte Video was reached, and the _Beagle_ was occupied in\r\nsurveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of America, south of\r\nLa Plata, during the succeeding two years. During ten weeks at Maldonado\r\nan entertaining excursion to the River Polanco was made, and many a\r\nhumorous remark appears in the Journal relating to it. \"The greater\r\nnumber of the inhabitants [of European descent] had an indistinct idea\r\nthat England, London, and North America were different names for the\r\nsame place; but the better-informed well knew that London and North\r\nAmerica were separate countries close together, and that England was a\r\nlarge town in London!\" \"Washing my face in the morning caused much\r\nspeculation at the village of Las Minas; a superior tradesman closely\r\ncross-questioned me about so singular a practice.\" Among these rich\r\ndescendants of Europeans Darwin felt as if he were among the inhabitants\r\nof Central Africa; so low can the proud superior race descend, that the\r\ndistance between it and the negro appeared small indeed. The remarkable\r\nabsence of trees in the country could not fail to provoke comment; but\r\nit is on the old-fashioned basis, and the young student does not get\r\nbeyond the conclusion \"that herbaceous plants, instead of trees, were\r\ncreated to occupy that wide area, which, within a period not very\r\nremote, has been raised above the waters of the sea.\" This appears in\r\nthe first edition; but in 1845 these words were expunged, and the author\r\nsays significantly \"we must look to some other and unknown cause.\"\r\n\r\nAt Maldonado within the distance of a morning's walk no fewer than\r\neighty species of birds were collected, most of them exceedingly\r\nbeautiful. Darwin's observations on the molothri (representatives of our\r\ncuckoos), the tyrant fly-catchers, and the carrion-feeding hawks are\r\nmost attractive reading. Rio Negro, much further south, was next\r\nvisited, and the fauna of a salt lake examined. The adaptation of\r\ncreatures to live in and near brine struck him as wonderful. \"Well may\r\nwe affirm,\" says he, \"that every part of the world is habitable! Whether\r\nlakes of brine, or those subterranean ones, hidden beneath volcanic\r\nmountains--warm mineral springs--the wide expanse and depths of the\r\nocean--the upper regions of the atmosphere, and even the surface of\r\nperpetual snow--all support organic beings.\" Here he found reason to\r\nbelieve that all the great plains which he was surveying had been raised\r\nabove the sea level in a modern geological period.\r\n\r\nOur naturalist started by land for Bahia Blanca and Buenos Ayres on\r\nAugust 11, 1833, and we have the record: \"This was the first night which\r\nI had ever passed under the open sky, with the gear of the recado for my\r\nbed. There is high enjoyment in the independence of the Gaucho's life,\r\nto be able at any moment to pull up your horse, and say, 'Here we will\r\npass the night.' The deathlike stillness of the plain, the dogs keeping\r\nwatch, the gipsy group of Gauchos making their beds round the fire, have\r\nleft in my mind a strongly-marked picture of this first night, which\r\nwill not soon be forgotten.\" After an interesting _rencontre_ with\r\nGeneral Rosas, Bahia Blanca was reached, and at Punta Alta were found\r\nmany of the fossil bones which Owen subsequently described, this point\r\nbeing a perfect catacomb, as Darwin terms it, for monsters of extinct\r\nraces. The remains of nine great kinds of quadrupeds chiefly allied to\r\nthe sloths were found embedded on the beach within a space of about two\r\nhundred yards square; and these were associated with shells of molluscs\r\nof still existing species. Here was indeed a remarkable fact to\r\ngerminate in the great naturalist's mind. It bore full fruit at a later\r\ndate. An important theory then current, that large animals require a\r\nluxuriant vegetation, was overthrown at the same time, for there was\r\nevery reason to believe that the sterility of the surrounding country\r\nwas no new thing. The South American ostrich and many other animals\r\nhere afforded material for important observations.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Buenos Ayres, the rugged Sierra de la Ventana, a white\r\nquartz mountain, was ascended. Buenos Ayres was reached on September 20,\r\n1833, and no time was lost in arranging for an expedition to Santa Fé,\r\nnearly 300 miles up the Parana. On October 3, Santa Fé was entered, and\r\nnear it many more remains of large extinct mammals were found. The\r\nremains of a horse, in a similar fossil condition, greatly astonished\r\nour explorer, for it seemed indeed surprising that in South America a\r\nnative horse should have co-existed with giant extinct forms, and should\r\nitself have become extinct, to be succeeded in modern times by the\r\ncountless herds descended from the few horses introduced by the Spanish\r\ncolonists. These and other strange facts in the distribution of\r\nmammalian animals in America led Darwin to make some pregnant comments.\r\nThe enormous number of large bones embedded in the estuary deposits\r\nbecame continually more evident, until he came to the conclusion that\r\nthe whole area of the Pampas was one wide sepulchre.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately ill-health compelled the explorer to return, and on\r\nOctober 12th he started for Buenos Ayres in a small vessel. During this\r\njourney he had an opportunity of examining the shifting and variable\r\nislands of the muddy Parana, on which the jaguar thrives. Arrived at Las\r\nConchas, a revolution had broken out, and Darwin was detained to a\r\ncertain extent under surveillance; but by the influence of General\r\nRosas' name, he was allowed to pass the sentinels, leaving his guide\r\nand horses behind, and ultimately reached Buenos Ayres in safety. After\r\na fortnight's delay, Monte Video was once more made for. Here it\r\nappeared that the _Beagle_ would remain sometime longer, so the restless\r\ninquirer started on another expedition, this time up the Uruguay and Rio\r\nNegro. One of the halts was at the house of a very large landed\r\nproprietor. A friend of the proprietor's, a runaway captain from Buenos\r\nAyres, was very anxious to have the traveller's opinion on the beauty of\r\nthe Buenos Ayres ladies, and on receiving satisfactory assurances,\r\nvoluntarily gave up his bed to the stranger! During this journey amazing\r\nquantities of huge thistles were met with, the cardoon being as high as\r\na horse's back, while the Pampas thistle rose above the rider's head. To\r\nleave the road for a yard was out of the question. Incidentally the\r\nwriter describes fully the horsemanship of the Gauchos, and gives a\r\nvivid picture of the state of society in the towns.\r\n\r\nDuring this journey, too, a peculiar breed of small cattle, called\r\nniata, was observed, but full details were not given till the second\r\nedition of the Journal appeared. This breed is strangely at a\r\ndisadvantage in droughts, compared with ordinary cattle; their lower\r\njaws project beyond the upper, and their lips do not join, rendering\r\nthem unable to browse on twigs. \"This strikes me,\" says Darwin, \"as a\r\ngood illustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary\r\nhabits of life, on what circumstances, occurring only at long intervals,\r\nthe rarity or extinction of a species may be determined.\" By the time\r\nthis appeared, however, in 1845, the author had embarked on his great\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Plata was quitted on December 6, 1833, and sail was made for\r\nPort Desire, on the coast of Patagonia. One evening, ten miles from the\r\nBay of San Blas, myriads of butterflies filled the air, so that the\r\nseamen cried out that it was snowing butterflies. The flight seemed to\r\nbe voluntary. On another occasion many beetles were found alive and\r\nswimming, seventeen miles from the nearest land. But these instances\r\nwere insignificant compared with the alighting of a large grasshopper on\r\nthe _Beagle_, when to windward of the Cape de Verde Islands, and when\r\nthe nearest land, in a direction not opposed to the prevailing trade\r\nwind, was 370 miles distant. Marvellous appearances of spiders far from\r\nland were also noted. One day when the ship was sixty miles from land\r\nvast numbers of a small gossamer spider arrived. Its habits in fact were\r\naëronautic; it would send forth a small thread, and suddenly letting go\r\nits hold, would sail away horizontally.\r\n\r\nThe _Beagle_ arrived at Port Desire on December 23, 1833, but Patagonia\r\nafforded less of interest to the zoologist than the northern countries.\r\nThe next halt was made at Port St. Julian, 110 miles further south, on\r\nJanuary 9, 1834. Here the evidences of the modern elevation of Patagonia\r\nwere powerfully reinforced, and further, from the nature of the animal\r\nremains arose the conviction that \"existing animals have a close\r\nrelation in form with extinct species,\" another of the germinal facts\r\nwhich bore fruit in the \"Origin of Species.\" Darwin was led to speculate\r\non the causes which could have extinguished so many great species, and\r\nhe remarks most suggestively: \"One is tempted to believe in such simple\r\nrelations as variation of climate and food, or introduction of enemies,\r\nor the increased numbers of other species, as the cause of the\r\nsuccession of races.\" But he does not yet go farther. He ends his\r\nreflections by observing: \"All that at present can be said with\r\ncertainty is that, as with the individual, so with the species, the hour\r\nof life has run its course, and is spent.\"\r\n\r\nIn the second edition of the Journal the philosopher showed signs of\r\nconsiderable advance (pp. 174-5). The effect of changed conditions is\r\nfurther developed. The checks to indefinite multiplication are insisted\r\non, while the tendency of every species to increase geometrically is\r\nclearly pointed out. In the place of the former concluding sentence we\r\nfind the following: \"To admit that species generally become rare before\r\nthey become extinct--to feel no surprise at the comparative rarity of\r\none species with another, and yet to call in some extraordinary agent\r\nand to marvel greatly when a species ceases to exist, appears to me much\r\nthe same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the prelude to\r\ndeath--to feel no surprise at sickness--but when the sick man dies, to\r\nwonder, and to believe that he died through violence.\"\r\n\r\nThe continental regions of South America did not supply the sole food\r\nfor the reflections of the young naturalist during this period. An\r\nintervening visit had been paid, in December, 1832, and January, 1833,\r\nto Tierra del Fuego, and the natives were most carefully observed. He\r\nwas greatly struck by their low condition; \"one can hardly make oneself\r\nbelieve they are fellow creatures, and inhabitants of the same world.\"\r\nYet these abject people have been infinitely raised since that period\r\nby missionaries, and Darwin, hearing of this success, which he termed\r\nwonderful, sent a donation to the South American Missionary Society.\r\n\r\nThe Falkland Islands were explored both in 1833 and 1834, and the\r\nStraits of Magellan were carefully examined, and many valuable\r\ngeological facts recorded. The southern portion of the continent was at\r\nlast quitted for Chili, Valparaiso being reached on July 23, 1834. After\r\nTierra del Fuego this was a delightful change, and here Darwin found an\r\nold schoolfellow and friend, Mr. Richard Corfield, who entertained him\r\nhospitably during his stay in Chili. Various expeditions to the Andes,\r\nto Santiago, to gold mines and copper mines, supplied abundant objects\r\nof curiosity and science, as well as varied visions of beauty; but the\r\nfatigues undergone had to be paid for by a month's illness at\r\nValparaiso, during which Mr. Corfield's kindness was unremitting.\r\n\r\nThe large island of Chiloe was visited in November, and its climate even\r\nin summer proved wretched, reminding one of some parts of the Hebrides,\r\na week without torrents of rain being wonderful. Castro, the almost\r\ndeserted Spanish capital, could not furnish, even among hundreds of\r\ninhabitants, a pound of sugar or an ordinary knife. No one possessed\r\neither a watch or a clock, and the church bell was rung by guess by an\r\nold man who was supposed to have the best notion of time.\r\n\r\nIn December the rugged Chonos Archipelago, still further south, was\r\nexplored. Here a storm worthy of Tierra del Fuego was experienced.\r\n\"White, massive clouds were piled up against a dark blue sky, and\r\nacross them black, ragged sheets of vapour were rapidly driven. The\r\nsuccessive mountain ranges appeared like dim shadows; and the setting\r\nsun cast on the woodland a yellow gleam, much like that produced by the\r\nflame of spirits of wine on a man's countenance. The water was white\r\nwith the flying spray; and the wind lulled and roared again through the\r\nrigging. It was a most ominous, sublime scene.\" While near Tres Montes\r\nthe year 1835 was ushered in, as Darwin says, \"with the ceremonies\r\nproper to it in these regions. She lays out no false hopes; a heavy N.W.\r\ngale, with steady rain, bespeaks the rising year. Thank God, we are not\r\ndestined here to see the end of it, but hope then to be in the Pacific,\r\nwhere a blue sky tells one there is a heaven--a something beyond the sky\r\nabove our heads.\"\r\n\r\nValdivia being reached in February, the _Beagle_ party were witnesses of\r\na severe earthquake. Darwin was on shore, lying down in the wood to\r\nrest. The effect produced upon him by the motion he experienced was very\r\nmarked: \"There was no difficulty in standing upright, but the motion\r\nmade me almost giddy. It was something like the movement of a vessel in\r\na little cross ripple, or still more like that felt by a person skating\r\nover thin ice, which bends under the weight of his body. A bad\r\nearthquake at once destroys the oldest associations; the world, the very\r\nemblem of all that is solid, has moved beneath our feet like a crust\r\nover a fluid; one second of time has conveyed to the mind a strange idea\r\nof insecurity, which hours of reflection would never have created.\" By\r\nthe same earthquake every house in Concepcion (afterwards visited) was\r\nthrown down, and a most impressive sight met the travellers.\r\n\r\nArriving at Valparaiso again on March 11, 1835, after only an interval\r\nof two days the indefatigable explorer started to cross the Cordillera\r\nby the seldom traversed Portillo pass. Here geological observations were\r\nabundant. The roar of the mountain torrents spoke eloquently to the\r\ngeologist. \"The thousands and thousands of stones, which, striking\r\nagainst each other, make the one dull uniform sound, are all hurrying in\r\none direction. It is like thinking of time, when the minute that now\r\nglides past is irrecoverable. So it is with these stones; the ocean is\r\ntheir eternity, and each note of that wild music tells of one other step\r\ntowards their destiny.\" Who can fail to discern in such a passage the\r\npoetic instinct which Erasmus Darwin more fully manifested?\r\n\r\nMendoza was reached on March 27th, and on the 29th the return journey by\r\nthe northern or Uspallata pass was commenced. On the 10th of April\r\nSantiago was again arrived at, and Mr. Caldcleugh most hospitably\r\nwelcomed the traveller, delighted with his expedition. \"Never,\" he says,\r\n\"did I more deeply enjoy an equal space of time.\" Various excursions in\r\nNorthern Chili and Peru followed. Little was seen of Peru, owing to the\r\ntroubled state of public affairs, and there was very little regret when\r\nthe _Beagle_ started early in September on her journey across the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThe Galapagos Islands, with their two thousand volcanic craters, their\r\napparently leafless bushes and wretched weeds, their peculiar animals,\r\nso unsuspicious of man that they did not move when stones were thrown,\r\nwere extremely interesting to the naturalist, and gave rise to numerous\r\nobservations and suggestions in later works. The huge tortoises slowly\r\ncarrying their great bodies about, appeared like strange antediluvian\r\nanimals. The hideous large water-lizard (_Amblyrhynchus_), swimming with\r\nperfect ease, and capable of an hour's immersion in sea-water; and the\r\nland lizard of the same genus, so numerous that at James Island it was\r\nhardly possible to find a spot free from their burrows, the roofs of\r\nwhich constantly give way under the pedestrian, were equally strange\r\ndenizens of this group of islands, where reptiles replace herbivorous\r\nmammals. With regard to the last-mentioned species we find a remark\r\nindicating the persistence of a belief in special creation up to this\r\ndate. \"It would appear as if this species had been created in the centre\r\nof the Archipelago, and thence had been dispersed only to a certain\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the years intervening between the first and second editions of\r\nthe Journal, reflection intensified Darwin's perception of the\r\nsingularity of the Galapagos fauna. \"Considering the small size of these\r\nislands,\" he says, \"we feel the more astonished at the number of their\r\naboriginal beings, and at their confined range. Seeing every height\r\ncrowned with its crater, and the boundaries of most of the lava streams\r\nstill distinct, we are led to believe that within a period geologically\r\nrecent the unbroken sea was here spread out. Hence, both in space and\r\ntime, we seem to be brought somewhat nearer to that great fact--that\r\nmystery of mysteries--the first appearance of new beings on this earth.\"\r\nAnd he afterwards says, \"One is astonished at the amount of creative\r\nforce, if such an expression may be used, displayed on these small,\r\nbarren, and rocky islands; and still more so at its diverse yet\r\nanalogous action in points so near each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe long voyage to Tahiti, 3,200 miles, begun on October 20, 1835,\r\nending on November 15th, was succeeded by a most enjoyable stay. Darwin\r\nwas as delighted as any traveller with the charms of the island and the\r\nislanders. His testimony to the quality of English products is worth\r\nnoticing, if only as a piece of natural patriotism. He acknowledges that\r\nTahitian pineapples are of excellent flavour, perhaps better than those\r\ncultivated in England, and this he believes to be the highest compliment\r\nwhich can be paid to a fruit, or indeed to anything else. He found\r\nreason to speak well of the influence of the Christian missionaries on\r\nthe natives, and of the conscientiousness of the latter, in opposition\r\nto Kotzebue's narrative.\r\n\r\nOn December 19th New Zealand was sighted. Our traveller's observations\r\nhere are of much value, as relating to a late period before civilised\r\ngovernment was effectively established. At Waimate he was delighted with\r\nthe effects produced by the religious teacher. \"The lesson of the\r\nmissionary is the enchanter's wand,\" and he rejoiced as an Englishman at\r\nwhat his countrymen had effected. The remarkable absence of land\r\nmammals, the late enormous increase of the imported Norway rat, the dock\r\nspreading far and wide, its seeds having been sold as tobacco seeds by a\r\nrascally Englishman, the huge Kauri pines, were all full of import to\r\nthe inquiring mind; but New Zealand proved on the whole less\r\nattractive, as seen by Darwin, than most other countries he had visited.\r\nDecember 30th saw the _Beagle_ on the way to Sydney, and Port Jackson\r\nwas reached on January 12, 1836. An interesting excursion to the Blue\r\nMountains and to Bathurst showed many aspects of colonial life, as well\r\nas the strange duckbill or platypus in its native haunts. Tasmania, with\r\nwhich island Darwin was greatly pleased, was visited in February. In\r\nApril the Keeling Islands furnished much of the material for the future\r\nbook on coral reefs, the essence of which is, however, included in the\r\nJournal. Mauritius, Cape Town, St. Helena, Ascension, Bahia, Pernambuco,\r\nCape Verde, and the Azores were the successive stages of the homeward\r\njourney, and on October 2, 1836, anchor was cast at Falmouth, where the\r\nnaturalist, equipped for his life work, was landed.\r\n\r\nThe high opinion Captain Fitzroy formed of Darwin during this long\r\nvoyage is shown by many passages in his own narrative, and by many other\r\nreferences. He paid him the marked compliment of naming no fewer than\r\nthree important geographical localities after him, namely, Mount Darwin\r\nand Darwin Sound (Tierra del Fuego), and Port Darwin in North Australia,\r\nthus connecting his name for future generations with two lands whose\r\ninhabitants were subjects of Darwin's unceasing interest and\r\ninvestigation throughout life, and served in no small degree to\r\nelucidate the history and rise of mankind in Darwin's mind and for a\r\nworld's instruction. Fitzroy complimented his friend markedly when\r\nhimself receiving the medal of the Royal Geographical Society; and in\r\none of his papers, speaking of him as a zealous volunteer in the cause\r\nof science, observed that his perseverance might be estimated from the\r\nfact that he never ceased to be a martyr to sea-sickness; while his\r\ninterest in science and his public spirit were evident from his having\r\npresented his valuable collections to the public.\r\n\r\nThe concluding pages of the Journal are both eloquent and instructive.\r\nEverywhere there had been fascinating visions, and attractive problems\r\nremained unsolved. Was it not significant of future studies that the\r\ncontrast between barbarian and civilised man should have been so\r\nimpressed upon the future author of \"The Descent of Man\"? He writes thus\r\non this subject, \"Of individual objects, perhaps no one is more certain\r\nto create astonishment than the first sight in his native haunt of a\r\nreal barbarian, of man in his lowest and most savage state. One's mind\r\nhurries back over past centuries, and then asks, could our progenitors\r\nhave been such as these? Men, whose very signs and expressions are less\r\nintelligible to us than those of the domesticated animals; men, who do\r\nnot possess the instinct of those animals, nor yet appear to boast of\r\nhuman reason, or at least of arts consequent on that reason. I do not\r\nbelieve it is possible to describe or paint the difference between\r\nsavage and civilised man. It is the difference between a wild and tame\r\nanimal: and part of the interest in beholding a savage, is the same\r\nwhich would lead every one to desire to see the lion in his desert, the\r\ntiger tearing his prey in the jungle, the rhinoceros on the wide plain,\r\nor the hippopotamus wallowing in the mud of some African river.\"\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt thus at length upon the history of this eventful voyage,\r\nnot only because it filled an important space in Darwin's life, but also\r\nbecause it undoubtedly gave rise to the thoughts and speculations which\r\nimpelled him to devote his life to the study of problems of evolution.\r\nIt has been shown to some extent, how he saw, without pre-arrangement,\r\njust those phenomena which could stimulate his mind, already fit, to its\r\nhighest flights. We have seen, too, how universal was Darwin's interest\r\nin nature, and how sympathetic a heart went with his scientific insight.\r\nHe had yet to show how masterly was his patience, to work for yet twenty\r\nyears, in order that he might not by premature publication of a crude\r\ntheory risk defeat and throw science backward rather than forward. This\r\nlong patient work was to be the triumph of his genius.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3: This statement by Darwin disposes of Mr. Grant Allen's\r\nassertion that geology was Darwin's \"first love\" (p. 36). He reckoned\r\nhimself an entomologist when he went to Cambridge, and certainly Mr.\r\nAinsworth's statement shows that he was a naturalist in a wide sense\r\nwhile at Edinburgh. C. V. Riley, the well-known American entomologist,\r\nsays (Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, U.S., vol.\r\ni., 1882, p. 70) \"I have the authority of my late associate editor of\r\n_The American Entomologist_, Benjamin Dann Walsh, who was a class-mate\r\nof Darwin's at Cambridge, that the latter's love of natural history was\r\nchiefly manifested, while there, in a fine collection of insects.\"\r\nIndeed, he was one of the original members of the Entomological Society\r\nof London, founded in 1833, and showed an active interest in its affairs\r\nthroughout life, being elected a member of its council in 1838. As early\r\nas January 4, 1836, a memoir based on insects sent home by Darwin from\r\nChiloe, was read before the Society by Charles Babington, now Professor\r\nof Botany at Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n[4: Mr. Grant Allen (\"Darwin,\" p. 42) states that Darwin\r\nobserved sixty-seven distinct organic forms in the fine dust which fell\r\non deck. It was Ehrenberg who determined these organisms in dust sent to\r\nhim by Darwin, and four out of five of the packets of dust sent to\r\nEhrenberg were given to Darwin by Lyell (Darwin's Journal, second\r\nedition, p. 5).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his return home, Darwin speedily placed himself in communication with\r\nthe leaders of scientific progress, and, in consequence of the valuable\r\nresults of his voyage, he soon found himself in a most advantageous\r\nposition. On November 20, 1836, he was elected a Fellow of the\r\nGeological Society, and before the end of the year he had sent the\r\nmanuscript of one of his early papers to Lyell, who writes to him\r\n(December 26, 1836): \"I have read your paper with the greatest\r\npleasure.... What a splendid field you have to write upon.\" He strongly\r\nadvised the young man not to accept any official scientific place, but\r\nto devote himself to his own line of work. But Darwin was overpersuaded,\r\nand became a member of the Council of the Geological Society in the\r\nfollowing February, and secretary in February, 1838. This office he held\r\nwith success for three years. Lyell referred in considerable detail to\r\nthe young traveller's views in his presidential address to the Society\r\nin 1837.\r\n\r\nDarwin's geological papers soon became numerous. In 1837 he discussed in\r\nsuccession the recent elevation of the coast of Chili, the deposits\r\ncontaining extinct mammalia in the neighbourhood of the Plata, the areas\r\nof elevation and subsidence in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, as deduced\r\nfrom the study of coral formations, and the formation of mould (the\r\nprecursor of a work he issued more than forty years later). Papers on\r\nthe connection of certain volcanic phenomena, and on the formation of\r\nmountain chains, and other geological notes on South America, were read\r\nin 1838; the interesting Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, in Scotland, which\r\nhe believed to be of marine origin, were described in 1839; the erratic\r\n(glacial) boulders of South America, in 1841; and coral reefs in 1842: a\r\nfull record, one would imagine, of busy years, occupied also with\r\nsecretarial work. Lyell, writing to Sir John Herschel (May 24, 1837),\r\nsays: \"I am very full of Darwin's new theory of coral islands, and have\r\nurged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my\r\nvolcanic crater theory for ever, though it costs me a pang at first.\" In\r\nMarch, 1838, Lyell describes the reception of the paper on volcanic\r\nphenomena at the Geological Society. \"He opened upon De la Beche,\r\nPhillips, and others, his whole battery of the earthquakes and volcanoes\r\nof the Andes; and argued that spaces of a thousand miles long were\r\nsimultaneously subject to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and that\r\nthe elevation of the Pampas, Patagonia, &c., all depended upon a common\r\ncause.\" In fit acknowledgment of such services to science, he was\r\nelected a Fellow of the Royal Society on January 24, 1839.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1839 Darwin married his cousin, Emma Wedgwood, daughter of his\r\nuncle Josiah Wedgwood: a union which, though consanguineous, proved in\r\nthe highest degree congenial and fortunate. In succeeding years a\r\nnumerous family of sons and daughters surrounded the happy parents.\r\nAfter considerable delays by the Admiralty, though it had long been\r\nready, the Journal appeared, in 1839, as the third volume of Fitzroy's\r\n\"Voyages of _The Adventure_ and _Beagle_.\" _The Quarterly Review_ (lxv.\r\n224) said that there could be no two opinions of its merits. \"We find\r\nample materials for deep thinking; we have the vivid description that\r\nfills the mind's eye with brighter pictures than painter can present,\r\nand the charm arising from the freshness of heart which is thrown over\r\nthese virgin pages of a strong intellectual man, and an acute and deep\r\nobserver.\" Its merits, however, were somewhat slow to become known to\r\nthe general public, owing to the original expensive form of publication;\r\nand it was not till 1845, when the second and enlarged edition appeared\r\nas \"The Journal of Researches,\" that the popular ear was gained. Later,\r\nunder the title, \"A Naturalist's Voyage Round the World,\" the book has\r\nbecome very widely known and appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe publication of \"The Zoology of the Voyage of _The Beagle_,\"\r\ncommenced in 1838, under Darwin's superintendence, gave a fuller view of\r\nthe acquisitions to natural history which had been made than had\r\npreviously been possible. The Treasury, acting on the representations of\r\nthe presidents of the Linnean, Zoological, and Geological Societies, as\r\nwell as of the naturalist himself, in 1837 made a grant of £1000 towards\r\nthe expenses of publication of these memoirs. Owen's description of the\r\nfossil mammalia, completed in 1840; G. Waterhouse's of the living\r\nmammalia, in 1839; Gould's of the birds, in 1841; L. Jenyns's of the\r\nfish, in 1842; and Thomas Bell's of the reptiles, in 1843--all in\r\nquarto, with beautiful plates, were a solid testimony to a splendid\r\nsuccess. Darwin furnished an introduction to each part, and the portions\r\nof the text referring to the habits and ranges of the living animals.\r\nThree species of mastodon and the gigantic megatherium were the only\r\nextinct mammalia known from South America previous to Darwin's voyage.\r\nTo these were now added the _Mylodon Darwinii_, a giant sloth; the\r\nscelidotherium, a somewhat smaller form; the great camel-like, yet\r\nodd-toed, macrauchenia; and the toxodon, as large as a hippopotamus, yet\r\nhaving a strange resemblance to the little rodents. All these belonged\r\nto geological deposits not far anterior to the present age. The\r\ncollections of living vertebrates were less profoundly interesting, but\r\nthe number of new species was large; and the habits and localities being\r\nrecorded by so good an observer, gave them additional value.\r\n\r\nThe fossil mammals were given by the generous traveller to the London\r\nCollege of Surgeons, the mammals and birds to the Zoological Society,\r\nthe reptiles to the British Museum, and the fishes to the Cambridge\r\nPhilosophical Society. Nor was this all. The collections of insects,\r\nshells, and crustacea were described by many able specialists in\r\nscientific publications. The flowering plants were described by Hooker,\r\nand the non-flowering by Berkeley; and, altogether, no expedition ever\r\nyielded a more solid result to the scientific naturalist, while\r\nfurnishing a delightful narrative to the general reader, and laying the\r\nfoundation for generalisations of surpassing importance to all thinking\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to many geologists that the greatest value would attach\r\nto the full record of the geological observations made by the gifted\r\nyoung secretary of the Geological Society. A year after the publication\r\nof the Journal the first portion of these observations, dealing with\r\ncoral reefs, was almost ready, but the continued ill-health of the\r\nauthor delayed the publication till 1842. When it appeared, under the\r\ntitle of \"The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs,\" its success\r\nwas immediate and complete.\r\n\r\nEver since their first description by voyagers, marvel had been\r\nexpressed at the strange and beautiful phenomena presented by coral\r\nislands. Coral, as being built up by the tireless labours of innumerable\r\nso-called \"insects,\" or \"worms,\" had become associated with romantic\r\nideas. It really consists of the internal skeletons of coral-polyps,\r\nallied to the sea anemone. Captain Basil Hall, in his \"Voyage to Loo\r\nChoo,\" looking with the eyes of one ignorant of zoology, had credited\r\nthe building of coral reefs to all kinds of creatures which lived on and\r\nnear the coral after it had been made; and his erroneous views had been\r\namplified and developed by James Montgomery, in his \"Pelican Island,\"\r\ninto the most fantastically incorrect description that ever versifier\r\npenned. Sad to relate, his lines were often quoted, as if correct, by\r\nscientific men in pre-Darwinian times.\r\n\r\nNothing gives clearer evidence of the power of mind which Darwin had\r\nalready attained when voyaging round the world than the originality of\r\nhis views on coral reefs. The lagoon islands, or atolls, he describes as\r\n\"vast rings of coral rock, often many leagues in diameter, here and\r\nthere surmounted by a low verdant island, with dazzling white shores,\r\nbathed on the outside by the foaming breakers of the ocean; and, on the\r\ninside, surrounding a calm expanse of water which, from reflection, is\r\nof a bright, but pale, green colour.\" Keeling atoll, outside which, at\r\nless than a mile and a half distance, no bottom was found with a line\r\n7,200 feet in length, having been fully described, and an account given\r\nof all other known atoll systems, the peculiarities of the great barrier\r\nreef of North-east Australia, and that of New Caledonia, were recounted.\r\nOff the latter, no bottom was found, at two ships' length from the reef,\r\nwith a line 900 feet long. With these were linked the smaller reefs of\r\nTahiti and others, where considerable islands are more or less\r\ncompletely surrounded by them. Next, the fringing or shore reefs, at\r\nfirst sight only a variety of barrier reefs, were clearly distinguished\r\nfrom them by the absence of an interior deep-water channel, and their\r\nnot growing up from an immense, but from a moderate depth of water.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable fact was pointed out by Darwin that all coral islands are\r\nwithin a little more than 30 degrees of the Equator, but that, at the\r\nsame time, they are absent over certain larger areas within the tropical\r\nseas. There are none on the West Coast of South America, nor on the West\r\nCoast of Africa. In this portion of his work we have another significant\r\nsentence bearing on the struggle for existence. In discussing the\r\napparently capricious distribution of coral reefs, he remarks that \"the\r\nstudy of the terrestrial and better-known half of the world must\r\nconvince every one that no station capable of supporting life is\r\nlost--nay more, that there is a struggle for each station between the\r\ndifferent orders of nature.\" He describes the large fishes and the\r\ntrepangs (_holothuriæ_) preying upon the coral-polyps, and shows how\r\ncomplex are the conditions which determine the formation of reefs on any\r\nshore. Perhaps no part of his work is more important than that in which\r\nhe collects the evidence proving how rapidly coral masses grow, and that\r\nthey for the most part cannot flourish in a greater depth of water than\r\nfifteen fathoms.\r\n\r\nReasoning upon the facts observed by himself and others Darwin now\r\nproceeded to upset the received theory that atolls were based upon\r\nsubmarine volcanic craters, and to substitute for it the view that there\r\nhas been a prolonged and gradual subsidence of the areas upon which the\r\natolls are based, and a corresponding upward growth of the reef-building\r\ncorals. Thus fringing-reefs in time become barrier-reefs; and\r\nbarrier-reefs, when they encircle islands, are converted into atolls, or\r\nlagoon islands, as soon as the last pinnacle of land sinks beneath the\r\nsurface of the ocean. The whole matter is summed up thus: \"A magnificent\r\nand harmonious picture of the movements which the crust of the earth has\r\nwithin a late period undergone is presented to us. We see vast areas\r\nrising, with volcanic matter every now and then bursting forth through\r\nthe vents or fissures with which they are traversed. We see other wide\r\nspaces slowly sinking without any volcanic outbursts; and we may feel\r\nsure that this sinking must have been immense in amount as well as in\r\narea, thus to have buried over the broad face of the ocean every one of\r\nthese mountains above which atolls now stand like monuments, marking the\r\nplace of their former existence.\" \"No more admirable example of\r\nscientific method was ever given to the world,\" says Professor A.\r\nGeikie, \"and even if he had written nothing else, this treatise alone\r\nwould have placed Darwin in the very front of investigators of nature.\"\r\n\r\nAfter thirty-two years' interval, a second edition of \"Coral Reefs\"\r\nappeared, in a cheaper form, in 1874. It is rare indeed for a scientific\r\ntreatise to attain at once and maintain so long a position of such\r\nundisputed authority. The eminent German naturalist, Semper, in 1863,\r\ncriticised the general theory in consequence of his own careful\r\nexamination of the Pelew Islands; but Darwin easily answered him by\r\npointing to the cumulative evidence in favour of his own views. The only\r\nreally important work on the subject, after Darwin's, was that of\r\nProfessor J. D. Dana, the eminent American naturalist and geologist, on\r\n\"Corals and Coral Islands,\" published in 1872. Darwin, in the preface to\r\nhis second edition, candidly acknowledged that he had not previously\r\nlaid sufficient weight on the mean temperature of the sea in determining\r\nthe distribution of coral reefs; but this did not touch his main\r\nconception. In fact, he maintained his ground undisturbed, and at the\r\nsame time admired greatly Dana's book, which was the result of personal\r\nexamination of more coral formations than perhaps any one man had ever\r\nstudied, and which accepted Darwin's fundamental proposition, that\r\nlagoon islands or atolls and barrier-reefs have been formed during\r\nperiods of subsidence.[5]\r\n\r\nNo such strikingly original theory is propounded in the second part of\r\n\"The Geology of the _Beagle_\" dealing chiefly with volcanic islands. St.\r\nJago, in the Cape de Verde Islands; Fernando Noronha, Terceira, Tahiti,\r\nMauritius, St. Paul's, Ascension, St. Helena, and the Galapagos are in\r\nturn more or less fully described, according to the opportunities the\r\nexplorer had possessed. To some extent, as in the succeeding part,\r\nDarwin adapts his views on mountain elevation too closely to those\r\nenunciated by Elie de Beaumont. The third part of the geology of the\r\n_Beagle_, entitled \"Geological Observations on South America,\" was not\r\npublished till 1846. Even this did not exhaust the contributions to\r\ngeology made from the _Beagle_ voyage, for it did not include the papers\r\non the \"Connection of certain Volcanic Phenomena in South America\"\r\n(1838); on the \"Distribution of Erratic Boulders\" (1841); on the \"Fine\r\nDust which falls on Vessels\" (1845); and on the \"Geology of the\r\nFalkland Islands\" (1846). A second edition of the two latter parts of\r\n\"The Geology of the _Beagle_\" was published in one volume in 1876.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after spending a few years of his early married life in\r\nLondon, during which he was often in ill-health, Darwin fixed his\r\nresidence in 1842 at Down House, near Beckenham, Kent. The little\r\nvillage of Down, three or four miles from the Orpington railway station,\r\nwas near enough to London for convenient access, yet greatly secluded\r\nand thoroughly rural. The traveller's roving days were over, and his\r\ninfirmity of health prevented him from undertaking very fatiguing\r\njourneys. After the cessation of his active work for the Geological\r\nSociety, Darwin's chief public appearance was when he spoke at the\r\nOxford meeting of the British Association, in 1847, when, strange to\r\nsay, Ruskin was secretary of the Geological Section.\r\n\r\nAt Down then, situated some 400 feet above the sea level on a plateau of\r\nchalk, interrupted by wavy hollows with beech woods on the slopes, about\r\nforty years of Darwin's life were passed. Down House, one of the square\r\nred brick mansions of the last century, to which have been since added a\r\ngable-fronted wing on one side and a more squarely-built wing and\r\npillared portico on the other, is shut in and almost hidden from the\r\nroadway by a high wall and belt of trees. On the south side a walled\r\ngarden opens into a quiet meadow, bounded by underwood, through which is\r\nseen a delightful view of the narrow valley beyond, towards Westerham.\r\n\r\nOne of the most admirable chapters of the well-known \"Manual of\r\nScientific Enquiry,\" published in 1849, for the use of the navy and\r\ntravellers generally, and edited by Sir John Herschel, was Darwin's, on\r\nGeology. The explorer is here taught to make the most of his\r\nopportunities upon the soundest principles. The habits which the author\r\nhad himself formed are inculcated upon the observer--copious collecting,\r\naccurate recording, much thinking. Nothing is omitted. Number-labels\r\nwhich can be read upside down must have a stop to indicate the right way\r\nup; every specimen should be ticketed on the day of collection; diagrams\r\nof all kinds should be made, as nearly as possible, to scale. \"Acquire\r\nthe habit of always seeking an explanation of every geological point met\r\nwith.\" \"No one can expect to solve the many difficulties which will be\r\nencountered, and which for a long time will remain to perplex\r\ngeologists; _but a ray of light will occasionally be his reward, and the\r\nreward is ample_.\" Truly an ample reward awaited the observer who could\r\nthus speak of the value of \"a ray of light;\" he certainly did, to use\r\nthe concluding words of the essay, \"enjoy the high satisfaction of\r\ncontributing to the perfection of the history of this wonderful world.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Darwin had been carrying on a great research on the very\r\npeculiar order of crustacea, termed Cirripedia, better known as\r\nbarnacles and acorn shells. He had originally only intended to describe\r\na single abnormal member of the group, from South America, but was led,\r\nfor the sake of comparison, to examine the internal parts of as many as\r\npossible. The British Museum collection was freely opened to him, and as\r\nthe importance of studying the anatomy of many specimens became\r\nevident, the splendid collections of Messrs. Stutchbury, Cuming, and\r\nothers were placed at his disposal, and he was permitted to open and to\r\ndissect unique specimens of great value. In fact, almost every\r\nnaturalist of note who had any knowledge of the subject freely aided\r\nhim, and the result was a masterly series of finely illustrated volumes;\r\ntwo on the living Cirripedia, issued by the Ray Society in 1851 and\r\n1854; and two on the fossil Cirripedia of Great Britain, by the\r\nPalæontographical Society, published in the same years. There is\r\nevidence in these volumes that careful observations on the growth of\r\nthese creatures had been made as far back as the visit to the Galapagos\r\nIslands in 1835. In many respects these works are as masterly as any the\r\nauthor ever wrote. Considering the previous obscurity of the subject,\r\nthe difficulties attending the research, the almost entire lack at that\r\ntime of any general microscopical knowledge of tissues, and especially\r\nof those of embryos, Darwin's success is marvellous. The details are too\r\ntechnical for statement here, but any one with a zoological training,\r\nwho studies the strange complication of the reproductive systems, and\r\nthe remarkable transformations which the young undergo, as told in these\r\nvolumes, will appreciate more than ever the breadth and the solidity of\r\nthe basis of patiently acquired knowledge which Charles Darwin had\r\naccumulated while his \"Origin of Species\" was taking shape.\r\n\r\nAt the anniversary meeting of the Royal Society in November, 1853, a\r\nroyal medal was presented to the author of \"Coral Reefs\" and the \"Memoir\r\non the Cirripedia,\" the president, the Earl of Rosse, eulogizing the\r\nformer as one of the most important contributions to modern geology, and\r\nthe latter as containing new facts and conclusions of first-rate\r\ninterest. Finally, this chapter of Darwin's life may be closed with the\r\ntardy award of the Wollaston medal to him by the Geological Society, in\r\nFebruary, 1859, when Professor John Phillips spoke of him as combining\r\nthe rarest acquirements as a naturalist, with the qualifications of a\r\nfirst-class geologist, and as having by his admirable monograph on the\r\nfossil Cirripedia added much to a reputation already raised to the\r\nhighest rank.\r\n\r\nYet even such a reputation could not secure fair treatment and impartial\r\njudgment for the coming book, the subject of which might be supposed to\r\nrequire supreme gifts of the very kind Darwin possessed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5: Mr. John Murray's views, derived from the experience\r\nacquired in the voyage of the _Challenger_, and published in 1880, tend\r\nto modify Darwin's conclusions to some extent. Mr. Murray says that it\r\nis now shown that many submarine mountains exist, which are usually\r\nvolcanic, and which, being built upon by various forms of shell-bearing\r\nanimals, could be raised to such a level that ordinary corals could\r\nbuild upon them. He concludes that probably all atolls are seated on\r\nsubmarine volcanoes, and thus it is not necessary to suppose such\r\nextensive and long-continued subsidences as Darwin suggested. This view\r\nis also in harmony with Dana's views of the great antiquity and\r\npermanence of the great ocean basin. See \"The Structure and Origin of\r\nReefs and Islands.\" By John Murray; Proc. Roy. Soc., Edin., x. 505-18\r\n(abstract); also _Nature_, xxii. 351-5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf no other record of Darwin's twenty-two years (1837-59) of life and\r\nthought after his return to England remained than the papers and books\r\nhe published during that period, we should find enough to place him on a\r\nlevel with the most gifted biologists and geologists of his age. But all\r\nthat time he was occupied with thoughts, researches, and experiments, of\r\nwhich the world at large perceived no fruits. Few persons suspected that\r\na tremendous revolution in scientific thought was in preparation at the\r\nquiet country home at Down. New species of animals and plants were being\r\ndescribed by naturalists at an alarming rate. The bulk of knowledge of\r\nspecific characters and the necessity of specialisation bade fair to\r\nmake every species-monger a dry and narrow pedant; and the pedants\r\nquarrelled about the characters and limits of their species.\r\n\r\nIn the later years of this period some rays of improvement shone out. To\r\nend the reign of Owen's misleading types and imaginary archetypes, there\r\narose a wielder of two potent words, \"morphology\" and \"biology,\" the\r\nsciences of form and of life, who showed that differences of adult form\r\ngrew out of likeness and simplicity in the young; and that the life of\r\nplants and animals was one science, their study one discipline. What\r\nHuxley had begun to proclaim from the housetop, Darwin was meditating in\r\nsecret; and much more. Let us see how he states the case in the famous\r\nmodest opening of the \"Origin of Species\" (1859): \"When on board H.M.S.\r\n_Beagle_, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the\r\ndistribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological\r\nrelations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent.\r\nThese facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of\r\nspecies--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our\r\ngreatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837,\r\nthat something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently\r\naccumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly\r\nhave any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to\r\nspeculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged\r\nin 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me\r\nprobable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued\r\nthe same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these\r\npersonal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in\r\ncoming to a decision.\" We learn also, independently, from the\r\n\"Expression of the Emotions\" (p. 19), that Darwin as early as 1838 was\r\ninclined to believe in the principle of evolution, or the derivation of\r\nspecies from other and lower forms.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to decide precisely what Darwin owed to his\r\npredecessors who believed in the mutability of species and doubted their\r\nseparate creation; this is partly owing to his exceeding modesty. He\r\nwas over-ready to acknowledge the value to himself of other people's\r\nideas, and he under-estimated the strength of the illumination which his\r\nown mind threw upon those ideas, transforming them from guesses into\r\nprobable hypotheses, confirming them by his vast and varied knowledge,\r\nand building a superstructure where they had laid but an uncertain\r\nfoundation. The question was in the air; guessing replies of great\r\ninterest were made by a few who doubted the received belief; but they\r\nwere not satisfying answers and they did not effect a revolution. Goethe\r\nin Germany, Erasmus Darwin in England,[6] and Geoffroy Saint Hilaire in\r\nFrance, came independently to similar conclusions as to the mutability\r\nof species; and Lamarck followed with several well-known works in\r\n1801-15, in which he upholds the doctrine that all species, including\r\nman, are descended from other species. As Darwin says, Lamarck first did\r\nthe eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all\r\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\r\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. He saw the\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing between species and varieties, the almost\r\nperfect gradation of form in some groups, and the great similarity of\r\ndomestic breeds of animals to such species. He believed that some degree\r\nof change was produced by the physical conditions of life, the\r\nintercrossing of species, and by habits causing increased use or disuse\r\nof parts. Indeed he thought very many remarkable adaptations, such as\r\nthat of the neck of the giraffe for browsing on trees, were the effect\r\nof habit. But he attributed, perhaps, more to a law of progressive\r\ndevelopment impressed on all forms of life, which thus would all in\r\ntime gradually cease to be lowly, their place being taken by new forms\r\ncontinually or \"spontaneously\" generated.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Lamarck would by any means have sufficed to\r\nconvince Darwin, judging from his references to him in his Journal and\r\nthe \"Origin.\" Here is the passage in which in the second edition of his\r\nJournal he refers to the blindness of the Brazilian Tucutuco, or\r\nCtenomys, a rodent or gnawing mammal with the habits of a mole:\r\n\"Considering the strictly subterranean habits of the Tucutuco, the\r\nblindness, though so common, cannot be a very serious evil; yet it\r\nappears strange that any animal should possess an organ frequently\r\nsubject to be injured. Lamarck would have been delighted with this fact\r\nhad he known it when speculating (probably with more truth than usual\r\nwith him) on the gradually _acquired_ blindness of the Aspalax, a gnawer\r\nliving underground, and of the Proteus, a reptile living in dark caverns\r\nfilled with water, in both of which animals the eye is in an almost\r\nrudimentary state, and is covered with a tendinous membrane and skin....\r\nIn the Tucutuco, which, I believe, never comes to the surface of the\r\nground, the eye is rather larger (than in the mole), but often rendered\r\nblind and useless, though without apparently causing any inconvenience\r\nto the animal: no doubt Lamarck would have said that the Tucutuco is\r\nnow passing into the state of the Aspalax and Proteus.\" Many years\r\nafterwards in the \"Origin of Species\" Darwin referred to the \"erroneous\r\nviews and grounds of opinion of Lamarck.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt some impulse to Darwin's views in this direction would be due\r\nto his intercourse with Dr. Grant at Edinburgh, whose celebrated paper\r\non the fresh-water sponge concludes with a declaration of his belief\r\nthat species are descended from other species, and that they become\r\nimproved in the course of modification. But previous to the occurrences\r\nof his voyage, we can find no stronger influence tending to make Darwin\r\nan evolutionist, than Lyell's \"Principles of Geology,\" which, by showing\r\nconstant and gradual change as the law of the world's history now as in\r\npast periods, gave emphasis and point to all observations of change and\r\nsuccession in the living world. Indeed, in June, 1836, before Darwin's\r\nvoyage was over, Lyell writes to Sir John Herschel: \"In regard to the\r\norigination of new species, I am very glad to find that you think\r\nit probable that it may be carried on through the intervention of\r\nintermediate causes. I left this rather to be inferred, not thinking it\r\nworth while to offend a certain class of persons by embodying in words\r\nwhat would only be a speculation. But the German critics have attacked\r\nme vigorously, saying, that by the impugning of the doctrine of\r\nspontaneous generation, and substituting nothing in its place, I have\r\nleft them nothing but the direct and miraculous intervention of the\r\nFirst Cause, as often as a new species is introduced, and hence I have\r\noverthrown my own doctrine of revolutions carried on by a regular system\r\nof secondary causes.... When I first came to the notion, which I never\r\nsaw expressed elsewhere, though I have no doubt it had all been thought\r\nout before, of a succession of extinction of species, and creation of\r\nnew ones going on perpetually now, and through an indefinite period of\r\nthe past, and to continue for ages to come, all in accommodation to the\r\nchanges which must continue in the inanimate and habitable earth, the\r\nidea struck me as the grandest which I had ever conceived, so far as\r\nregards the attributes of the Presiding Mind.\"\r\n\r\nIn a succeeding paragraph, Lyell very remarkably foreshadows Darwin's\r\n\"natural selection\" and \"struggle for existence.\" He speaks of a species\r\nbeing rendered more prolific in order to perpetuate its existence;\r\n\"but this would perhaps make it press too hard upon other species at\r\nother times. Now if it be an insect it may be made in one of its\r\ntransformations to resemble a dead stick, or a leaf, or a lichen, or a\r\nstone, so as to be somewhat less easily found by its enemies; or if this\r\nwould make it too strong, an occasional variety of the species may have\r\nthis advantage conferred on it; or if this would be still too much, one\r\nsex of a certain variety. _Probably there is scarcely a dash of colour\r\non the wing or body of which the choice would be quite arbitrary, or\r\nwhich might not affect its duration for thousands of years._\" The\r\nsignificance of the last sentence is immense, and when we reflect that\r\nthis bold but cautious thinker was in constant intercourse with Darwin,\r\nwe can readily comprehend why the second edition of the Journal was so\r\nenthusiastically dedicated to Lyell. On page 481 of the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" Darwin acknowledges that the belief that species were\r\nimmutable productions was almost unavoidable, as long as the history of\r\nthe world was thought to be of short duration: which affords another\r\nproof how profoundly Lyell's views on the long duration of the past\r\nhistory of the globe, and its modification by the slow operation of\r\nexisting causes, influenced Darwin, and led him to comprehend how\r\nspecies might be modified.\r\n\r\nWe see Darwin, then, possessed of the idea that species are mutable,\r\ninformed as to past and recent changes in the animal, plant, and\r\nphysical world, seeking for causes which should suffice to produce\r\nmodification of species by a continuous law. The next step in his\r\nprogress was attention to domestic animals and cultivated plants. As he\r\nwrote in 1864 to Haeckel, one of his most brilliant followers: \"In South\r\nAmerica three classes of facts were brought strongly before my mind.\r\nFirstly, the manner in which closely-allied species replace species in\r\ngoing southward. Secondly, the close affinity of the species inhabiting\r\nthe islands near South America to those proper to the continent. This\r\nstruck me profoundly, especially the difference of the species in the\r\nadjoining islets in the Galapagos Archipelago. Thirdly, the relation of\r\nthe living Edentata and Rodentia to the extinct species. I shall never\r\nforget my astonishment when I dug out a gigantic piece of armour like\r\nthat of the living armadillo.\r\n\r\n\"Having reflected much on the foregoing facts, it seemed to me probable\r\nthat allied species were descended from a common ancestor. But during\r\nseveral years I could not conceive how each form could have been\r\nmodified so as to become admirably adapted to its place in nature. I\r\nbegan, therefore, to study domesticated animals and cultivated\r\nplants,[7] and after a time perceived that man's power of selecting and\r\nbreeding from certain individuals was the most powerful of all means in\r\nthe production of new races. Having attended to the habits of animals,\r\nand their relations to the surrounding conditions, I was able to realise\r\nthe severe struggle for existence to which all organisms are subjected;\r\nand my geological observations had allowed me to appreciate, to a\r\ncertain extent, the duration of past geological periods. With my mind\r\nthus prepared, I fortunately happened to read Malthus's 'Essay on\r\nPopulation;' and the idea of natural selection through the struggle for\r\nexistence at once occurred to me. Of all the subordinate points in the\r\ntheory, the last which I understood was the cause of the tendency in the\r\ndescendants from a common progenitor to diverge in character.\"[8]\r\n\r\nMalthus taught the inevitable tendency of all animal life to increase\r\nbeyond the means of subsistence, and expounded the checks which begin to\r\nact when population increases too rapidly. But his book had lain\r\nunfruitful to naturalists since 1798, until Darwin read it, and with\r\nhis special knowledge evolved from it the brilliant idea of the\r\npreservation of better-equipped races in the struggle for life, or, as\r\nHerbert Spencer put it, the survival of the fittest. At one bound the\r\ngloomy revelations of misery which the \"Essay on Population\" contained,\r\nwere exchanged for the bright view of perpetual progress and improvement\r\nas being necessitated and brought about by the very struggle which\r\nensued upon the natural increase of animal and plant life. Instead of\r\nstruggle and pain, producing starvation and extinction merely, struggle\r\nand pain were seen as the conditions of development and improvement; the\r\ndeath of the lower, the life of the higher.\r\n\r\nIt is less profitable here to attempt to sketch the history of ideas of\r\nevolution in general, because that history as now revealed by research,\r\nand as detailed by many writers, was not the path along which Darwin\r\ntravelled. Indeed, many of these ideas were not disinterred, and\r\ncertainly were not brought to Darwin's notice till after the publication\r\nof the \"Origin of Species.\" True he read Robert Chambers's \"Vestiges of\r\nCreation,\" which, with its \"powerful and brilliant style,\" although\r\ndisplaying in its earlier editions \"little accurate knowledge and a\r\ngreat want of scientific caution,\" Darwin acknowledges to have done\r\nexcellent service in calling attention to the subject, in removing\r\nprejudice, and in preparing the ground for the reception of analogous\r\nviews. Herbert Spencer, in his Essay on the Development Hypothesis,\r\nfirst published in _The Leader_ in March, 1852, and republished in his\r\n\"Essays\" (first series, 1858), argued that species have been modified\r\nowing to change of circumstances, basing his argument upon the analogy\r\nof domestic animals and plants, the changes which the embryos of many\r\nspecies undergo, and the difficulty of distinguishing species and\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nBut we need not here dwell on the works of these thinkers, important as\r\nthey are to the general history of evolutionary thought, because\r\nDarwin's speculations had taken form long before, and he could be but\r\nslightly indebted to them. Far in advance of them he was at work\r\ncollecting and testing the facts which alone could win general support\r\nfor his views, and experimenting incessantly with the same object in\r\nview. Lyell and Hooker were in his confidence, and in Lyell's letters we\r\nmeet with references such as the following, dated November 13, 1854:\r\n\"You probably know about this (the remarkable orchid, Catasetum), which\r\nwill figure in C. Darwin's book on 'Species,' with many other 'ugly\r\nfacts,' as Hooker, clinging like me to the orthodox faith, calls these\r\nand other abnormal vagaries,\" showing at the same time how completely\r\nDarwin was the leader, while his friends, advanced as they were, hung\r\nback. Again (Lyell to Hooker, July 25, 1856): \"Whether Darwin persuades\r\nyou and me to renounce our faith in species (when geological epochs are\r\nconsidered) or not, I foresee that many will go over to the indefinite\r\nmodifiability doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nFurther light is thrown on the progress of ideas on species by Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker's admirably written Introductory Essay to the \"Flora Novæ\r\nZelandiæ,\" dated November, 1853, in which he discusses among other\r\nquestions, \"The Limits of Species; their Dispersion and Variation.\"\r\nWhile still adhering on the whole to the origin of species from single\r\nparents, or from one pair, and the permanence of specific characters, he\r\ninsists that species vary more, and are more widely distributed, than is\r\ngenerally admitted, and that their distribution has been brought about\r\nby natural causes. In this essay he makes the following statements: \"Mr.\r\nDarwin not only directed my earliest studies in the subjects of the\r\ndistribution and variation of species, but has discussed with me all the\r\narguments, and drawn my attention to many of the facts which I have\r\nendeavoured to illustrate in this essay. I know of no other way in which\r\nI can acknowledge the extent of my obligation to him, than by adding\r\nthat I should never have taken up the subject in its present form but\r\nfor the advantages I have derived from his friendship and\r\nencouragement.\"\r\n\r\nAppropriately enough, it was through Lyell and Hooker that the new\r\ntheory was introduced to the public, and it was owing to them that\r\nDarwin did not obliterate his own claims to priority, and give them over\r\nto Alfred Russel Wallace, who had independently come to similar\r\nconclusions. The letter, dated June 30, 1858, in which the announcement\r\nwas conveyed to the Linnean Society, deserves quotation, as being the\r\nauthoritative and accurate record of the circumstances which launched\r\nthe \"Origin of Species\" upon the world:\r\n\r\n     \"The accompanying papers, which we have the honour of communicating\r\n     to the Linnean Society, and which all relate to the same subject,\r\n     viz., 'The Laws which affect the Production of Varieties, Races,\r\n     and Species,' contain the results of the investigations of two\r\n     indefatigable naturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred\r\n     Wallace.\r\n\r\n     \"These gentlemen having, independently and unknown to one another,\r\n     conceived the same very ingenious theory to account for the\r\n     appearance and perpetuation of varieties and of specific forms on\r\n     our planet, may both fairly claim the merit of being original\r\n     thinkers in this important line of inquiry; but neither of them\r\n     having published his views, though Mr. Darwin has been repeatedly\r\n     urged by us to do so, and both authors having now unreservedly\r\n     placed their papers in our hands, we think it would best promote\r\n     the interests of science that a selection from them should be laid\r\n     before the Linnean Society.\r\n\r\n     \"Taken in the order of their dates, they consist of--\r\n\r\n     \"1. Extracts from a MS. work on species, by Mr. Darwin, which was\r\n     sketched in 1839, and copied in 1844, when the copy was read by Dr.\r\n     Hooker, and its contents afterwards communicated to Sir Charles\r\n     Lyell. The first part is devoted to 'The Variation of Organic\r\n     Beings under Domestication and in their Natural State'; and the\r\n     second chapter of that part, from which we propose to read to the\r\n     Society the extracts referred to, is headed, 'On the Variation of\r\n     Organic Beings in a State of Nature; on the Natural Means of\r\n     Selection; on the Comparison of Domestic Races and true Species.'\r\n\r\n     \"2. An abstract of a private letter addressed to Professor Asa\r\n     Gray, of Boston, U.S., in October, 1857, by Mr. Darwin, in which\r\n     he repeats his views, and which shows that these remained unaltered\r\n     from 1839 to 1857.\r\n\r\n     \"3. An essay by Mr. Wallace, entitled 'On the Tendency of Varieties\r\n     to depart indefinitely from the Original Type.' This was written at\r\n     Ternate in February, 1858, for the perusal of his friend and\r\n     correspondent, Mr. Darwin, and sent to him with the expressed wish\r\n     that it should be forwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, if Mr. Darwin\r\n     thought it sufficiently novel and interesting. So highly did Mr.\r\n     Darwin appreciate the value of the views therein set forth, that he\r\n     proposed, in a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, to obtain Mr. Wallace's\r\n     consent to allow the essay to be published as soon as possible. Of\r\n     this step we highly approved, provided Mr. Darwin did not withhold\r\n     from the public, as he was strongly inclined to do (in favour of\r\n     Mr. Wallace) the memoir which he had himself written on the same\r\n     subject, and which, as before stated, one of us had perused in\r\n     1844, and the contents of which we had both of us been privy to for\r\n     many years. On representing this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us\r\n     permission to make what use we thought proper of his memoir, &c.;\r\n     and in adopting our present course, of presenting it to the Linnean\r\n     Society, we have explained to him that we are not solely\r\n     considering the relative claims to priority of himself and his\r\n     friend, but the interests of science generally; for we feel it to\r\n     be desirable that views founded on a wide deduction from facts, and\r\n     matured by years of reflection, should constitute at once a goal\r\n     from which others may start, and that, while the scientific world\r\n     is waiting for the appearance of Mr. Darwin's complete work, some\r\n     of the leading results of his labours, as well as those of his\r\n     able correspondent, should together be laid before the public.\"\r\n\r\nIn these papers, read on July 1, 1858, Darwin's share amounts to little\r\nmore than six pages, yet within this space he describes the geometrical\r\nrate of increase of animals, the checks that occur, the effects of\r\nchanged conditions, the natural selection of the better equipped forms\r\nresulting from the struggle for existence, and the influence of sexual\r\nselection. Wallace insists on essentially the same view, which he calls\r\nthat of progression and continued divergence. \"This progression, by\r\nminute steps, in various directions, but always checked and balanced by\r\nthe necessary conditions, subject to which alone existence can be\r\npreserved, may, it is believed, be followed out so as to agree with all\r\nthe phenomena presented by organised beings, their extinction and\r\nsuccession in past ages, and all the extraordinary modifications of\r\nform, instinct, and habits which they exhibit.\" Those who read Wallace's\r\noriginal essay can best appreciate the extraordinary simplicity and\r\nnobility of character which inclined the elder naturalist, who had so\r\nlong held the same views, to step aside in favour of the younger man,\r\nwho from different researches was led to such similar conclusions. It\r\nmay here be added that Hooker, in the Introductory Essay to the \"Flora\r\nTasmaniæ,\" dated November 4, 1859, before the publication of the \"Origin\r\nof Species,\" but after seeing much of it in manuscript, accepted and\r\nadvocated the view that species are derivative and mutable, and\r\ndeveloped it as regards the geographical distribution of plants.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6: It is worth while to reproduce here a few sentences from\r\nErasmus Darwin's \"Zoonomia,\" showing how acutely he guessed in the\r\ndirection of evolution.\r\n\r\n\"When we revolve in our minds, first, the great changes which we see\r\nnaturally produced in animals after their nativity.... Secondly, when we\r\nthink over the great changes introduced into various animals by\r\nartificial or accidental cultivation.... Thirdly, when we enumerate the\r\ngreat changes produced in the species of animals before their\r\nnativity.... Fourthly, when we revolve in our minds the great similarity\r\nof structure which obtains in all the warm-blooded animals.... Fifthly,\r\nfrom their first rudiment or primordium to the termination of their\r\nlives, all animals undergo perpetual transformations, which are in part\r\nproduced by their own exertions;... and many of these acquired forms or\r\npropensities are transmitted to their posterity.... A great want of one\r\npart of the animal world has consisted in the desire of the exclusive\r\npossession of the female; and these have acquired weapons to combat each\r\nother for this purpose.... The final cause of this contest amongst the\r\nmales seems to be that the strongest and most active animal should\r\npropagate the species, which should thence become improved. Another\r\ngreat want consists in the means of procuring food, which has\r\ndiversified the forms of all species of animals.... All which seem to\r\nhave been gradually produced during many generations by the perpetual\r\nendeavour of the creatures to supply the want of food, and to have been\r\ndelivered to their posterity with constant improvement of them for the\r\npurpose required.... The third great want among animals is that of\r\nsecurity, which seems much to have diversified the forms of their bodies\r\nand the colour of them.... The contrivances for the purposes of security\r\nextend even to vegetables.... Would it be too bold to imagine that in\r\nthe great length of time since the earth began to exist ... all\r\nwarm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the\r\nGreat First Cause endued with animality;... possessing the faculty of\r\ncontinuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering\r\ndown those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without\r\nend!\"]\r\n\r\n[7: In this study Darwin came into communication, as early as\r\n1839, with the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterwards Dean of Manchester,\r\nand received from him a personal account of his experiments on hybrids.\r\nIt was Herbert who, as early as 1822, in the fourth volume of the\r\n\"Horticultural Transactions,\" and in his work on the Amaryllidaceæ,\r\n1837, declared that horticultural experiments have established, beyond\r\nthe possibility of refutation, that botanical species are only \"a higher\r\nand more permanent class of varieties.\" He extended the same view to\r\nanimals, and believed that single species of each genus were originally\r\ncreated in a highly plastic condition, and that these have produced,\r\nchiefly by intercrossing, but also by variation, all our existing\r\nspecies.]\r\n\r\n[8: The first portion of this important letter is quoted from\r\nthe English translation of Haeckel's \"History of Creation,\" 1876; the\r\nsecond portion from O. Schmidt's \"Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,\"\r\nhaving been re-written by Darwin from the German text.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarwin's great work \"On the Origin of Species by means of Natural\r\nSelection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for\r\nLife,\" was published in November, 1859. It begins with the simplest\r\nnarrative of the events leading to its publication, and an apology for\r\nthe imperfection of \"this abstract.\" The author is well aware, he says,\r\nthat on most points he deals with, facts can be adduced which often\r\napparently lead to conclusions directly opposite to his own. He states\r\nclearly the important truth that a mere belief in the origin of species\r\nby descent from other species is unsatisfactory until it can be shown\r\n_how_ species can have been modified so as to acquire their present\r\nremarkable perfection of structure and coadaptation. Consequently cases\r\nof observed modification of species are of the highest value, and\r\nprecedence is given to the variation of animals and plants in a state of\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\nThe individuals belonging to the same variety of any of our\r\nlong-cultivated animals or plants differ much more from each other than\r\nthe individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature.\r\nDarwin explains this by the changed conditions of their life, excess or\r\nchanged quality of food, climate, changed habits, &c. Thus man has\r\neffected remarkable changes in many species by consciously or\r\nunconsciously selecting particular qualities in the animals or plants\r\nkept for use or beauty. Domestic productions seem in fact to have become\r\nplastic in man's hands, and the inheritance of acquired qualities by\r\noffspring is reckoned on as almost certain. The breeds of cattle,\r\npoultry, dogs, and pigeons, are striking examples.\r\n\r\nDarwin, as he tells us, kept every breed of domestic pigeons he could\r\npurchase or obtain, in order to study their variations. In this he was\r\nhimself reverting to the associations of childhood, when the beauty,\r\nvariety, and tameness of The Mount pigeons at Shrewsbury were well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the astonishment with which the \"eminent fanciers\" and\r\nmembers of the London Pigeon Clubs, whose acquaintance the great\r\nnaturalist cultivated, received the simplicity, yet depth, of his\r\ninquiries, as he came among them day after day, utilising all their\r\nlore, and yet continually asking what they neither knew nor suspected\r\nthe drift of. He began his study with a prepossession against the idea\r\nof the immense diversity of modern pigeons having originated from one\r\ncommon stock. Yet if such modification has taken place in any creature,\r\npigeons may furnish an example, for they have been kept and bred for\r\nthousands of years, being recorded in Egypt about 3000 B.C., and Pliny\r\nrelates that their pedigree and race could be reckoned by the Romans of\r\nhis time. \"We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced\r\nas perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases\r\nwe know that this has not been their history. The key is man's power of\r\naccumulative selection; nature gives successive variations; man adds\r\nthem up in certain directions useful to him.\" This is an undoubted fact,\r\nto which breeders and fanciers give far more emphatic testimony even\r\nthan Darwin. As Lord Somerville said, speaking of what breeders have\r\ndone for sheep, \"It would seem as if they had chalked upon a wall a form\r\nperfect in itself, and then had given it existence.\"\r\n\r\nSide by side with conscious selection goes unconscious. Two breeders,\r\nbreeding from similar stock, aiming at the same end, will get different\r\nresults. Aiming at a particular result, they find that with it is\r\nassociated some other of which they had not dreamed. Thus through long\r\nages our cultivated vegetables and flowers have been produced, by always\r\nselecting the best variety, and sowing its seeds. The fact which Darwin\r\nnotes, that our cultivated plants and domestic breeds date from so\r\nancient a time that we know really nothing of their origin, has an\r\nimportant bearing on the great antiquity of man, then scarcely imagined,\r\nnow generally accepted; seeing that all domestic development depends on\r\na variability in living creatures, which man can not produce, but can\r\nonly work upon.\r\n\r\nThat variation of species occurs in a state of nature Darwin proves not\r\nonly by recorded facts, but by a consideration of the chaotic condition\r\nof species-description, owing to the differences between authors as to\r\nwhat are species and what are varieties, one observer describing a\r\ndozen species where another reckons only one. If such divergence of\r\nopinion is possible between good observers, it is evident that there is\r\nno sufficiently clear rule for deciding what a species is, although for\r\ncenturies naturalists have laboured to establish them. If species vary\r\ncontinually, and become modified, then this difficulty is explained.\r\n\r\nBut what is there in nature to answer to the breeder's selection? Here\r\ncomes in Darwin's remarkable application and amplification of Malthus's\r\nprinciple of population. \"Nothing is easier,\" he says, \"than to admit\r\nin words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more\r\ndifficult--at least I have found it so--than constantly to bear this\r\nconclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, I\r\nam convinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on\r\ndistribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation will be dimly\r\nseen or quite misunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with\r\ngladness; we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we\r\nforget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on\r\ninsects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget\r\nhow largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings are\r\ndestroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind,\r\nthat though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons\r\nof each recurring year.\" The proofs given of the enormous rate at which\r\nanimals and plants tend to increase in numbers are very striking; even\r\nthe elephant, the slowest breeder of all animals, would increase from\r\none pair to fifteen millions in the fifth century, if no check existed.\r\n\r\nThus every animal and plant may be said to struggle for existence with\r\nthose with which it competes for space, food, light, air. The numbers\r\nare kept down by heavy destruction at various periods of life. Take the\r\ncase of seedling plants. Darwin had a piece of ground three feet long\r\nand two feet wide dug and cleared, so that no grown plants existed to\r\ncheck the growth of seedlings of native plants as they came up. He\r\ncounted and marked all that came up, and out of 357 no fewer than 295\r\nwere destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. So in a little plot of\r\nlong-mown turf, allowed to grow freely, out of twenty species nine\r\nperished in the struggle. Many further personal observations of the\r\nauthor are given: such as that the winter of 1854-5 destroyed\r\nfour-fifths of the birds in his own grounds; that he has sometimes\r\nfailed to get a single seed from wheat or other plants in his garden.\r\n\r\nOn the estate of a relative in Staffordshire the changes consequent on\r\nplanting several hundred acres with Scotch fir were remarkable. In\r\ntwenty-five years twelve species of conspicuous plants, and six\r\ndifferent insectivorous birds had become settled and flourishing\r\ninhabitants in the plantations. The characteristic of the philosopher,\r\nwho sees in the unconsidered trifles of others the material for his\r\nchoicest discoveries, is well exemplified in his mode of observing the\r\nresults of enclosure near Farnham, in Surrey. Here a multitude of\r\nself-sown firs sprang up in the enclosures, and Darwin went to examine\r\ninto the cause of the strange phenomenon. Not a fir was in sight except\r\nsome distant clumps. \"But on looking closely between the stems of the\r\nheath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had been\r\nperpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard, at a point\r\nsome hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted\r\nthirty-two little trees; and one of them, judging from the rings of\r\ngrowth, had during twenty-six years tried to raise its head above the\r\nstems of the heath, and had failed.\"\r\n\r\nThe interdependence of animal upon animal, of animal upon plant, of\r\nplant upon animal, is enforced in many ways by Darwin. For instance, the\r\nvisits of humble-bees are of special importance to the welfare of red\r\nclover; humble-bees are largely destroyed by field-mice; cats largely\r\ndestroy field-mice near villages, and so favour humble-bees, and\r\nsecondarily red clover. Every paragraph of the chapter on the struggle\r\nfor existence is full of suggestion, and subversive of old imaginings.\r\nBut Darwin's knowledge is to him slight, his ignorance profound. Yet, he\r\nsays, notwithstanding our ignorance, \"we may console ourselves with the\r\nfull belief that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is\r\nfelt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the\r\nhealthy, and the happy survive and multiply.\"\r\n\r\nThe great chapter on Natural Selection, or the preservation of\r\nfavourable and the rejection of injurious variations, is crowded with\r\nstriking passages. One of these vividly contrasts man's selection with\r\nnature's. \"Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature\r\ncares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to\r\nany being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of\r\nconstitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects\r\nonly for his own good; nature only for that of the being she tends.\r\nEvery selected character is fully exercised by her; and the being is\r\nplaced under well-suited conditions of life.... Under nature, the\r\nslightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn the\r\nnicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be preserved. How\r\nfleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and\r\nconsequently how poor will his products be, compared with those\r\naccumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder,\r\nthen, that nature's productions should be far 'truer' in character than\r\nman's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the\r\nmost complex conditions of life, and should _plainly bear the stamp of\r\nfar higher workmanship_?\" The words in italics certainly are a good\r\nanswer to those who think Darwin had any tendency to depreciate the\r\nmarvels of nature by bringing them under the law of natural selection.\r\nBut we shall gain further light on this subject later on.\r\n\r\nThe main argument may be summed up thus: if variations beneficial to any\r\ncreature occur, which cannot be doubted, the individuals in whom they\r\noccur will have the best chance of surviving and transmitting their\r\nqualities to their offspring. This natural selection will tend to\r\nproduce divergence of character among offspring, and to intensify\r\ndifferences until they equal those between species or even genera. The\r\nsame tendency to improvement brings about the decay and ultimate\r\nextinction of many lower and unimproved forms of life.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of Darwin's style is in the passage comparing\r\nall members of the same class of beings to a great tree. \"I believe this\r\nsimile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may\r\nrepresent existing species; and those produced during each former year\r\nmay represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of\r\ngrowth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and\r\nto overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same\r\nmanner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other\r\nspecies in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great\r\nbranches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves\r\nonce, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the\r\nformer and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the\r\nclassification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate\r\nto groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere\r\nbush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and\r\nbear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during\r\nlong-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified\r\ndescendants. From the first growth of the tree many a limb and branch\r\nhas decayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various sizes\r\nmay represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no\r\nliving representatives, and which are known to us only from having been\r\nfound in a fossil state. As we here and there see a thin straggling\r\nbranch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some\r\nchance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit, so we\r\noccasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren,\r\nwhich in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches\r\nof life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by\r\nhaving inhabited a protected station. As buds give rise by growth to\r\nfresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides\r\nmany a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the\r\ngreat Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the\r\ncrust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever-branching and\r\nbeautiful ramifications.\"\r\n\r\nWhat may be the laws controlling or producing variation Darwin candidly\r\ntells us he does not know. Some authors, he says, believe it to be as\r\nmuch the function of the reproductive system to produce individual\r\ndifferences, or very slight deviations of structure, as to make the\r\nchild like its parents. But we certainly do not know the precise effect\r\nof any change of conditions, or what changes may be entailed in other\r\nparts of an organism by given changes in one part.[9]\r\n\r\nWhy, if species are continually being modified, do we not see multitudes\r\nof transitional forms around us? How can the elaborate structure and\r\nspecial habits of a bat have been formed by the modification of some\r\nanimal of entirely different habits? How can the marvellous perfections\r\nof the human eye or that of one of the higher animals be supposed to\r\nhave arisen through natural selection? These questions Darwin answers\r\nwith powerful effect; but for the details we must refer the reader to\r\nthe book itself. Incidentally he refers to objections urged against the\r\nview that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of\r\nits possessor. He says plainly that if structures have been created for\r\nbeauty in the eyes of man, or for mere variety, that is fatal to his\r\ntheory. Yet he admits that many structures are of no direct use to their\r\npossessors; but they have been inherited from ancestors to whom they\r\nwere of use, or they have arisen as correlated changes or in dependence\r\non some other cause, where use and benefit have been primary.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with Instinct, we see Darwin personally studying ants and\r\nbees in their social habits. The idea of ants making slaves is to him\r\n\"odious,\" which we can well understand after his references to slavery\r\nin South America. For three years, during June and July, he watched for\r\nmany hours several ants' nests in Surrey and Sussex to see whether the\r\nslaves ever left the nest. One day he witnessed a migration of ants from\r\none nest to another, the masters carefully carrying their slaves in\r\ntheir jaws. Again, he saw a party attempting to carry off slaves,\r\nsucceeding, however, only in carrying their corpses off for food to the\r\nnest. Darwin then dug up a small group of pupæ of the slave species from\r\nanother nest, and put them down near the place of combat. They were\r\neagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants, \"who perhaps fancied\r\nthat, after all, they had been victorious in their late combat.\" At the\r\nsame time the slave-owners were able to distinguish instantly the pupæ\r\nof another species, showing much terror at sight of them; yet they\r\nultimately took heart, and carried them off.\r\n\r\nThe cell-making instinct of the hive-bee, \"the most wonderful of all\r\nknown instincts,\" as Darwin terms it, was closely studied. The comb,\r\n\"so beautifully adapted to its end,\" he enthusiastically admired. Yet he\r\nfinds gradation among bees, and can imagine a method by which this\r\nbeautiful construction, has been gradually developed. His ideas were\r\ntested by setting bees to work on a solid piece of wax between two\r\ncombs. The detailed account of these experiments is most instructive. It\r\nis quite charming to mentally follow the patient experimenter covering\r\nthe edges of a single cell or the extreme margin of a growing comb with\r\na thin layer of vermilion wax, and soon proving that many bees work in\r\nsuccession at a single cell by the rapid diffusion of the vermilion\r\ncolouring as delicately as a painter could have done it, atoms of the\r\ncoloured wax being removed and worked into the growing cells all\r\nround.[10] \"It was really curious,\" Darwin says, \"to note in cases of\r\ndifficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle, how often the\r\nbees would entirely pull down and rebuild in different ways the same\r\ncell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first rejected.\"\r\nHere surely he was watching evolution in that slow, gradual process\r\nwhich appears to be the rule.\r\n\r\nThe castes of neuter ants, constituting as they did \"by far the most\r\nserious special difficulty\" Darwin had encountered, were similarly\r\nstudied; but, as expected, gradations were found connecting them,\r\nalthough the extremes differ markedly in shape and size. The case is\r\nmost interesting, because these castes could only be developed if the\r\nvariations which produced them were profitable to the community; \"for no\r\namount of exercise, or habit, or volition, in the utterly sterile\r\nmembers of a community could possibly have affected the structure or\r\ninstincts of the fertile members, which alone leave descendants.\" This\r\nfact Darwin considers to be demonstrative against Lamarck's doctrine. At\r\nthe same time, he admits that instincts are not always perfect, and are\r\nliable to make mistakes; and that no instinct has been produced for the\r\nexclusive good of other animals, but that each animal takes advantage of\r\nthe instincts of others. It is to him \"far more satisfactory to look at\r\nsuch instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, ants\r\nmaking slaves, the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies\r\nof caterpillars, not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as\r\nsmall consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all\r\norganic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the\r\nweakest die.\" And here Darwin strikes one of his truest and most helpful\r\nnotes. It _is_ far more satisfactory to contemplate the rapine and war\r\nof nature as incidents which aid in working out a grand progress than as\r\nmultitudinous cruelties, working no good, and in past ages of unknown\r\nlength merely preluding the struggle and rapine through which man works\r\nout his rise or fall. If we agonise that we and our descendants may\r\nrise, life is worth living.\r\n\r\nWe cannot follow in detail the profoundly suggestive chapters on\r\nHybridism, on the Imperfection of the Geological Record, on the\r\nGeological Succession of Organic Beings, on the Geographical\r\nDistribution, and on the Mutual Affinity of Plants and Animals. The\r\nfirst of these is one of the most difficult portions of the subject, and\r\nyet remains as a stumbling-block of science by its apparently\r\ninexplicable phenomena. The author throws on the past history of life on\r\nthe earth the glamour of a fairy record, as he contemplates the infinite\r\nnumber of generations, which the mind cannot grasp, which must have\r\nsucceeded one another in the long roll of years, the limited extent to\r\nwhich at any time fossil remains have been preserved, the immense amount\r\nof destruction of such records which has taken place; and hence argues\r\nmost powerfully how improbable it is that the transitional stages from\r\nspecies to species should have been handed down and also (another rare\r\nchance) have been laid open to us. The great array of facts about\r\nextinct animals and plants is shown to be consistent with, and to\r\nbe largely explained by, descent with modification, and to be\r\nincomprehensible on any other view. The eccentric contrasts and\r\nparallelisms displayed in the geographical distribution of plants and\r\nanimals, the striking effects of barriers such as mountains, deserts,\r\nand seas, the phenomena of dispersion of living creatures, the\r\nindications of old glacial periods in the present distribution of Alpine\r\nplants, the strange distribution of fresh-water animals and plants, the\r\nspecialities of oceanic islands, and many other subjects of a like kind,\r\nare dealt with, all being turned to advantage, and shown to give strong\r\nsupport to Darwin's view.\r\n\r\nClassification and classifiers are all made to bear testimony in the\r\nsame direction. Morphology, which, in the hands of Huxley, Haeckel,\r\nGegenbaur, Ray Lankester, and Balfour has, since the first issue of the\r\n\"Origin of Species,\" grown into a coherent science, based on embryology,\r\nwas even then seen by Darwin to yield evidence for his views. Examining\r\nvery young animals, he found that in very distinct races of dogs and\r\nhorses the young had by no means acquired their adult differences. He\r\ncompared pigeons of extremely various breeds twelve hours after being\r\nhatched, and found their differences incomparably less than in the\r\nfull-grown birds. How immensely morphological science has progressed\r\nsince Darwin directed investigation into this profitable line would need\r\na separate treatise to show; but it is not too much to say that\r\nembryology alone, without other evidence, would now suffice to prove the\r\ndoctrine of descent with adaptive modification.\r\n\r\nRudimentary organs, again, strange appearances, like the presence of\r\nteeth in unborn whales and in the front of the upper jaws of unborn\r\ncalves, the rudimentary wings of many insects, the rudimentary stamens\r\nor pistils of many flowers, are all swept into the Darwinian net.\r\n\"Nothing can be plainer than that wings are formed for flight; yet in\r\nhow many insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly\r\nincapable of flight, and not rarely lying under wing-cases, firmly\r\nsoldered together?\" These phenomena are all explicable if descent with\r\nmodification is true.\r\n\r\nApproaching the close of his work, the author expressed his doubts of\r\nbeing able to convert naturalists of long standing to his views; but\r\nbased his main hopes on young and rising men approaching these questions\r\nwithout prejudices. He put some puzzling questions, however, to those\r\nwho might oppose him. Did they really believe that at innumerable\r\nperiods in the earth's history certain atoms had been commanded suddenly\r\nto flash into living tissues? Were animals and plants created as eggs or\r\nseed or as full grown? At each act of creation was one individual or\r\nwere many produced? For himself, he came to the conclusion that all\r\norganic beings had descended from some one primordial form into which\r\nlife was first breathed.\r\n\r\nOn this view Darwin predicted that a great increase of interest in many\r\ndepartments of natural history would arise. \"When we no longer look at\r\nan organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly\r\nbeyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as\r\none which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure\r\nand instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the\r\npossessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great\r\nmechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience,\r\nthe reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus\r\nview each organic being, how far more interesting--I speak from\r\nexperience--will the study of natural history become.... The whole\r\nhistory of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite\r\nincomprehensible to us, will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment\r\nof time compared with the ages which have elapsed since the first\r\ncreature, the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living descendants,\r\nwas created.... We may look forward with some confidence to a secure\r\nfuture of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works\r\nsolely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental\r\nendowments will tend to progress towards perfection.\" The concluding\r\nsentence of the \"Origin of Species\" has become one of our classical\r\nquotations. \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several\r\npowers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;\r\nand that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed\r\nlaw of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful\r\nand most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to give a history of the criticisms and\r\ndiscussions which arose in regard to \"The Origin of Species,\" especially\r\nas Darwin himself took no public part in them, except by the alterations\r\nmade in successive editions. As indicating the tone of prominent\r\ncritical organs, we may note that _The Athenæum_ (November 19, 1859)\r\nacknowledges there is something poetical in the theory. \"If a monkey has\r\nbecome a man, what may not a man become?\" Neither book, author, nor\r\nsubject being ordinary, \"the work deserves attention.\" _The Edinburgh\r\nReview_ considered that the author left the question very nearly where\r\nhe found it. Failing to find original observations adequate even to give\r\na colour to the hypothesis, the reviewer sought to find flaws in the\r\nauthor's mode of reasoning, and concluded that \"we are called upon to\r\naccept a hypothesis on the plea of want of knowledge.\" Defective\r\ninformation, vagueness, and incompleteness are charged upon the man whom\r\nwe now delight to honour; \"intellectual husks,\" we are told; are all\r\nthat he offers. Professor Huxley, who lectured at the Royal Institution,\r\non February 10, 1860, on \"Species and Races and their Origin,\" and\r\nbrought forward Darwin's investigations as exemplifying that application\r\nof science to which England owes her greatness, was told that it more\r\ntruly paralleled \"the abuse of science to which a neighbouring\r\nnation--some seventy years since--owed its temporary degradation.\" And\r\nthe professor was accused of audaciously seeking to blind his audience.\r\nSamuel Wilberforce, then Bishop of Oxford, was equally denunciatory in\r\n_The Quarterly_. He hopes that \"this flimsy speculation\" will be\r\ncompletely put down. \"It is a dishonouring view of nature.... Under such\r\ninfluences,\" says the courtly bishop, \"a man soon goes back to the\r\nmarvelling stare of childhood at the centaurs and hippogriffs of fancy;\r\nor, if he is of a philosophic turn, he comes, like Oken, to write a\r\nscheme of creation under a 'sort of inspiration,' but it is the frenzied\r\ninspiration of the inhaler of mephitic gas. The whole world of nature is\r\nlaid for such a man under a fantastic law of glamour, and he becomes\r\ncapable of believing anything; and he is able, with a continually\r\ngrowing neglect of all the facts around him, with equal confidence and\r\nequal delusion, to look back to any past and to look on to any\r\nfuture.\"[11]\r\n\r\n_The Saturday Review_ was much more moderate, by no means sharing the\r\nanxiety of those who regarded evolutionary theories as hostile to\r\nChristianity. The author is said to have encountered the difficulties\r\nof his theory \"with admirable skill and ability,\" and though _The\r\nSaturday_ remained unconvinced of his general argument, yet it\r\nacknowledged itself \"persuaded that natural selection must henceforward\r\nbe admitted as the chief mode by which the structure of organised beings\r\nis modified in a state of nature;\" and thought it very possible that,\r\nthrough its agency, considerable groups of nearly allied species might\r\nhave been derived from a single progenitor: but there _The Saturday_\r\nstopped, believing in limits to this power.\r\n\r\nThe second edition of \"The Origin of Species,\" which appeared in\r\nJanuary, 1860, only six weeks after the first, contained but few\r\nalterations; the third, in March, 1861, had received extensive additions\r\nand corrections. The most important of these discussed the so-called\r\ntendency of organisation to advance, and explained the present\r\ncoexistence of high and lowly organised forms. A valuable historical\r\nsketch of the modern progress of opinion on the subject, from Lamarck's\r\ntime, was prefixed to the book. It was further enlarged in subsequent\r\neditions, as evidences accumulated that various thinkers had\r\nindependently adopted the evolution theory, or the more special one of\r\nnatural selection. Notable instances of anticipation were those of Dr.\r\nWells, who, in a paper read before the Royal Society in 1813, but not\r\npublished till 1818, had expressed the opinion that all animals tend to\r\nvary; that agriculturists improve breeds by selection; and that what\r\nthey do by art \"seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more\r\nslowly, by nature, in the formation of varieties of mankind.\" He then\r\ngoes on to exemplify the survival of the fittest, though in other words.\r\nMr. Patrick Matthew, in 1831, published a work on \"Naval Timber and\r\nArboriculture,\" in which he expressed, in scattered passages, a view\r\nnearly resembling Darwin's.\r\n\r\nThe fourth edition of \"The Origin,\" in 1866, was longer, by fifty pages,\r\nthan its predecessor. Among the additions may be mentioned a fuller\r\ntreatment of the argument from embryology, which was made stronger by\r\nlater investigations. The fifth edition (1869) was comparatively little\r\nincreased in bulk, though altered in many details. In particular it\r\ncontained a somewhat important change relating to the extent of the\r\ninfluence of natural selection. This is also referred to in \"The Descent\r\nof Man\" (first edition, vol. i. pp. 152-3), where the author says he had\r\nnot formerly considered sufficiently the existence of many structures\r\nwhich appeared to be neither beneficial nor injurious, and had\r\nattributed too much to natural selection. \"I was not able,\" he says, \"to\r\nannul the influence of my former belief, then widely prevalent, that\r\neach species had been purposely created; and this led to my tacitly\r\nassuming that every detail of structure, excepting rudiments, was of\r\nsome special, though unrecognised, service.... If I have erred in giving\r\nto natural selection great power, which I am far from admitting, or in\r\nhaving exaggerated its power, which is in itself probable, I have, at\r\nleast, as I hope, done good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of\r\nseparate creations.\"\r\n\r\nThe sixth edition (1872), in smaller type, was considerably revised and\r\naltered, and remains permanent. A glossary of scientific terms was added\r\nby Mr. W. S. Dallas. A new chapter was inserted after the sixth, and\r\nentitled \"Miscellaneous Objections to the Theory of Natural Selection.\"\r\nIt was partly derived from modified portions of chapter iv. of former\r\neditions, but the latter and larger part was new, and relates chiefly to\r\nthe supposed incompetency of natural selection to account for the very\r\nearly stages of useful structures. Numerous cases, such as the\r\ndevelopment of the giraffe's neck, the baleen of the whale, the mammary\r\nglands, &c., are admirably discussed. Causes preventing the acquisition,\r\nthrough natural selection, of useful structures in many cases are dealt\r\nwith, and reasons given for disbelieving in great and sudden\r\nmodifications. In the concluding chapter Darwin further admits that he\r\nhad formerly underrated the frequency and importance of use and disuse\r\nof parts, of the direct action of external conditions, and of variations\r\nwhich seem to us, in our ignorance, to arise spontaneously. He alludes\r\nto misrepresentations of his views, and calls attention to the fact\r\nthat, in the first edition, at the close of the introduction, he stated\r\nhis conviction that natural selection had been the main, _but not the\r\nexclusive_ means of modification. \"This has been of no avail. Great is\r\nthe power of steady misrepresentation; but the history of science shows\r\nthat, fortunately, this power does not long endure.\" This is Darwin's\r\nalmost sole allusion in his works to the persistence with which views\r\nnot his had been attributed to him, or he had been calumniated for views\r\nhe did hold. But in his own lifetime--nay, within fifteen years--he\r\nwitnessed a sufficiently satisfying revolution. \"I formerly spoke to\r\nvery many naturalists on the subject of evolution, and never once met\r\nwith any sympathetic agreement. It is probable that some did then\r\nbelieve in evolution, but they were either silent or expressed\r\nthemselves so ambiguously, that it was not easy to understand their\r\nmeaning. Now things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist\r\nadmits the great principle of evolution\" (\"Origin,\" sixth edition, p.\r\n424). At present the sale of the book in this country approaches forty\r\nthousand copies. Its sale in America has been very large; and numerous\r\ntranslations into German, French, Italian, Russian, Dutch, and Swedish,\r\nand even into Japanese and Hindustani, have been largely sold. It must\r\nalways be one of the most valued of all English classics.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9: Mr. Romanes, in his paper on \"Physiological Selection\"\r\n(Journal of the Linnean Society, Zoology, xix. 337-411), has entered\r\nupon a most important discussion of this question.]\r\n\r\n[10: The full text of a large part of Darwin's original chapter\r\non Instinct, which was omitted from the \"Origin of Species\" for the sake\r\nof condensation, is published in Mr. Romanes' \"Mental Evolution in\r\nAnimals,\" 1883, which also contains many other observations by Darwin.]\r\n\r\n[11: The reader will thus be able to judge for himself how far\r\nDarwin's \"Origin of Species\" gained, \"from the very first outset,\r\nuniversal respect and a fair hearing,\" as Mr. Grant Allen, with singular\r\nforgetfulness, states (\"Darwin,\" p. 112). The violence of the attacks\r\nmade upon Darwin by the majority of religious and orthodox journals is\r\nwell known.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already gathered much concerning Darwin's mental and moral fibre\r\nin our survey of his works. Let us make some further acquaintance with\r\nhis personality as known to his friends. Outwardly he appeared a man of\r\npowerful physique, standing six feet high, with prominent forehead and\r\nover-arching brow, and keen, deep-set eyes in which resolute strength\r\nand piercing insight were indicated. Apart from his persistent\r\ninfirmity, he was actively disposed, as indeed is evident from the\r\nlaborious journeys he undertook during his travels. Field sports,\r\nincluding hunting, were among the recreations of his more active years.\r\nBut through all his work or recreation the imperious conditions\r\nnecessitated by his infirmity of stomach had to be considered, and\r\nnothing but the most rigorous care could possibly have enabled him to\r\nachieve what he did. On many days he could not work at all, and on many\r\nothers two or three hours were his limit. And what but his own system,\r\nhis own orderliness and perseverance could have accomplished his task?\r\nIn preparing his books he had a special set of shelves for each,\r\nstanding on or near his writing-table, one shelf for each chapter. The\r\nmaxim, \"Early to bed, and early to rise,\" was his essentially, and\r\nregularity kept all balanced. Rising at six, he took a cold plunge bath,\r\nbreakfasted simply, and took a first walk, beginning work often at\r\neight. \"Later in the day,\" I quote from Mr. Woodall's pleasant pages,\r\n\"he generally walked again, often in his own grounds, but sometimes\r\nfurther afield, and then generally by quiet footpaths rather than\r\nfrequented roads. The walks at one time were varied by rides along the\r\nlanes on a favourite black cob, but some years before his death his\r\nfour-footed friend fell, and died by the roadside, and from that day the\r\nhabit of riding was given up. Part of the evening was devoted to his\r\nfamily and his friends, who delighted to gather round him to enjoy the\r\ncharm of his bright intelligence, and his unrivalled stores of\r\nknowledge. To Down, occasionally, came distinguished men from many\r\nlands; and there in later years would sometimes be found the younger\r\ngeneration of scientific students, looking up to the great naturalist\r\nwith the reverence of disciples, who had experienced his singular\r\nmodesty, his patient readiness to listen to all opinions, and the\r\nwinning grace with which he informed their ignorance and corrected their\r\nmistakes. In the midst of all the delights of home and the demands of\r\nstudy, Darwin kept an open mind for public affairs. He united the\r\nearnest politician with the patient student: a rare combination, which\r\nsupplies another proof of his largeness of heart and sympathy with his\r\nfellow men. In the village of Down he was liked by everybody, old and\r\nyoung, and in his own household the same servants lived year after year\r\nunder his roof. One of them, Margaret Evans, who assisted in nursing\r\nhim in his last illness, had come to Down nearly forty years before,\r\nfrom Shrewsbury, where her uncle and aunt were in Dr. Darwin's service.\"\r\n\r\nAt Down the family in time numbered nine children, two, however, not\r\nsurviving childhood; one died in 1842, another in 1858. His five sons\r\nhave already attained distinction or positions of influence. The eldest,\r\nWilliam Erasmus, became a banker in Southampton; the second, George, was\r\nsecond Wrangler and Smith's Prizeman at Cambridge in 1868, became a\r\nFellow of Trinity, and is now Plumian Professor of Astronomy at his\r\nuniversity, having early gained the Fellowship of the Royal Society for\r\nhis original papers bearing on the evolution of the universe and the\r\nsolar system, and many other subjects of high mathematical and\r\nphilosophical interest. His third son, Francis, gained first-class\r\nhonours in the Cambridge Natural Science Tripos in 1870, and is likewise\r\na Fellow of the Royal Society, in recognition of his original botanical\r\ninvestigations. The fourth, Leonard, an officer in the Royal Engineers,\r\nhas done valuable astronomical work. The fifth, Horace, has devoted\r\nhimself to mechanical science, and has largely aided in developing the\r\nCambridge Scientific Instrument Company.\r\n\r\nThe great thinker, fulfilling his duties as head of a family with\r\nsingular success, charged with the burden of new thoughts and\r\nobservations, slowly perfecting his life work, had neither time nor\r\ninclination for controversy. He set himself to publish facts, which by\r\ntheir accumulation tended to clench his arguments. Soon after the\r\n\"Origin of Species\" he had in course of publication several important\r\nbotanical papers, on the two forms of flower in the Primrose genus\r\n(1862), and in the genus Linum (flax), 1863, on the forms of\r\nLoosestrife, 1864, all published in the Linnean Society's Journal.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 he brought out his first botanical book, the \"Fertilisation of\r\nOrchids,\" more fully entitled, \"On the various Contrivances by which\r\nOrchids are Fertilised by Insects.\" These most singular flowers had long\r\nattracted great attention owing to their peculiar shapes and often their\r\ngreat beauty, while their marked deviation from typical forms of flowers\r\nperplexed botanists extremely. The celebrated Robert Brown, in a\r\nwell-known paper in the Linnean Society's Transactions, 1833, expressed\r\nthe belief that insects are necessary for the fructification of most\r\norchids; and as far back as 1793, Christian Sprengel (in \"The Newly\r\nDiscovered Secret of Nature\") gave an excellent account of the action of\r\nthe several parts in the genus Orchis, having discovered that insects\r\nwere necessary to remove the pollen masses. But the _rationale_ of the\r\nprocess was not fully known until Darwin revealed it, and illuminated it\r\nby the light of natural selection. He had, in the \"Origin of Species,\"\r\ngiven reasons for the belief that it is an almost universal law of\r\nnature that the higher organic beings require an occasional cross with\r\nanother individual. He here emphasised that doctrine by a series of\r\nproofs from a peculiar and otherwise inexplicable order of plants, and\r\nshowed that the arrangements by which orchids are fertilised have for\r\ntheir main object the fertilisation of the flowers with pollen brought\r\nby insects from a distinct plant.\r\n\r\nIn the group to which our common orchids belong, remarkable adaptations\r\nfor securing that the pollen masses brought from another flower solely\r\nthrough the visits of insects shall reach their precise destination,\r\nwere brought to light. \"A poet,\" says Darwin, \"might imagine that whilst\r\nthe pollinia were borne through the air from flower to flower, adhering\r\nto an insect's body, they voluntarily and eagerly placed themselves in\r\nthat exact position in which alone they could hope to gain their wish\r\nand perpetuate their race.\" As he had examined all the British genera,\r\nDarwin's conclusions were indubitable. He had patiently watched for\r\nhours on the grass to notice insects' visits, had counted the fertilised\r\nflowers on many spikes, the fertilised spikes on many plants, had\r\ndissected and redissected the flowers till he saw how the fertilisation\r\nmust absolutely be effected; and utilising the enthusiasm of orchid\r\ngrowers, had excited them to do the same, till his storehouse of facts\r\nwas full.\r\n\r\nOn examining the exotic forms of orchids, which are so conspicuous in\r\nour conservatories, still more striking facts presented themselves. In\r\nthe great group of the Vandeæ, relative position of parts, friction,\r\nviscidity, elastic and hygrometric movements were all found to be nicely\r\nrelated to one end--the aid of insects in fertilisation. Without their\r\naid not a plant in the various species of twenty-nine genera which\r\nDarwin examined would set a seed. In the majority of cases insects\r\nwithdraw the pollen masses only when retreating from the flower, and,\r\ncontinuing their flower visits, effect a union between two flowers,\r\ngenerally on distinct plants. In many cases the pollen masses slowly\r\nchange their position while adhering to the insects, and so assume a\r\nproper direction for striking the stigma of another flower, and the\r\ninsects during this interval will almost certainly have flown from one\r\nplant to another.\r\n\r\nThe family to which Catasetum belongs furnished the most remarkable\r\nexamples. This plant possesses a special sensitiveness in certain parts,\r\nand when definite points of the flower are touched by an insect the\r\npollen masses are shot forth like an arrow, the point being blunt and\r\nadhesive. The insect, disturbed by so sharp a blow, or having eaten its\r\nfill, flies sooner or later to a female plant, and whilst standing in\r\nthe same position as before, the pollen-bearing end of the arrow is\r\ninserted into the stigmatic cavity, and a mass of pollen is left on its\r\nviscid surface. The strange structures of Cypripedium, or the Lady's\r\nSlipper, were then analysed, and the mode of fertilisation by small bees\r\nwas discovered. The whole structure of orchids, as modified to secure\r\ninsects' visits and cross fertilisation, was now expounded, and the\r\nbenefits shown by cases where insects' visits were prevented, and no\r\nseed was set. The number of seeds in a capsule was reckoned, and thence\r\nit was found that the progeny of a single plant of the common orchis\r\nwould suffice to cover the globe in the fourth generation. A single\r\nplant of another orchid might bear seventy-four millions of seeds:\r\nsurely an ample provision for a struggle for existence, and selection\r\nand survival of the fittest. But, as Darwin remarks, profuse expenditure\r\nis nothing unusual in nature, and it appears to be more profitable for a\r\nplant to yield a few cross-fertilised than many self-fertilised seeds.\r\n\r\nDarwin impresses forcibly on his readers the endless diversity of\r\nstructures, and the prodigality of resources displayed for gaining the\r\nsame end, the fertilisation of one flower by pollen from another plant.\r\n\"The more I study nature,\" he says, \"the more I become impressed with\r\never-increasing force that the contrivances and beautiful adaptations\r\nslowly acquired through each part occasionally varying in a slight\r\ndegree ... transcend in an incomparable manner the contrivances and\r\nadaptations which the most fertile imagination of man could invent.\"\r\nFinally he concludes: \"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that nature\r\ntells us, in the most emphatic manner, that she abhors perpetual\r\nself-fertilisation\"; and thus was announced a new doctrine in botany. A\r\nsecond much-improved edition of this book appeared in 1877.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, in presenting the Copley medal of the Royal Society to the\r\nauthor of the \"Origin of Species,\" Major-General Sabine, the President,\r\nentered into a full description of the merits of his works, \"stamped\r\nthroughout with the impress of the closest attention to minute\r\ndetails and accuracy of observation, combined with large powers of\r\ngeneralisation.\" The award, while highly eulogising the \"Origin,\" was\r\nnot however based upon it, but on the more recent botanical writings.\r\n\"The Fertilisation of Orchids\" was described as perhaps the most\r\nmasterly treatise on any branch of vegetable physiology that had ever\r\nappeared; and the fact was justly emphasised that all Darwin's botanical\r\ndiscoveries had been obtained by the study of some of the most familiar\r\nand conspicuous of our native plants, and some of the best-known and\r\neasily-procured cultivated exotics.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 appeared another work from the Darwinian treasury, but in this\r\ncase it was at first restricted to the Journal of the Linnean Society\r\n(vol. ix.), and was not made generally available till the second edition\r\nwas published separately in 1875. \"The Movements and Habits of Climbing\r\nPlants\" described in the first place the twining of the hop plant,\r\nstudied by night and day continuously, in a well-warmed room, to which\r\nthe author was confined by illness. Again and again were different\r\nspecies of plants watched, and the periods in which their shoots\r\nrevolved noted. The clematises, tropæolums, solanums, gloriosa lilies\r\namong leaf-climbing plants; the bignonias, cobæas, bryonies, vines,\r\npassion flowers, and other tendril-bearing plants; the ivy, and other\r\nroot and hook climbers were carefully studied; and botanists for the\r\nfirst time realised fully the advantages which climbing plants possess\r\nin the struggle for existence. The climbing faculty depends on a\r\nsensitiveness to contact with any firm support, and a most interesting\r\nseries of modifications has probably, as Darwin suggests, led to the\r\npresent development of climbing organs, by the spontaneous movement of\r\nyoung shoots and other organs, and by unequal growth.\r\n\r\nIn concluding, the author made some most profoundly suggestive remarks,\r\nwhich went far to revolutionise our conception of plants. \"It has often\r\nbeen vaguely asserted that plants are distinguished from animals by not\r\nhaving the power of movement. It should rather be said that plants\r\nacquire and display this power only when it is of some advantage to\r\nthem; this being of comparatively rare occurrence, as they are affixed\r\nto the ground, and food is brought to them by the air and rain. We see\r\nhow high in the scale of organisation a plant may rise, when we look at\r\none of the more perfect tendril-bearers. It first places its tendrils\r\nready for action, as a polypus places its tentacula. If the tendril be\r\ndisplaced, it is acted on by the force of gravity, and rights itself. It\r\nis acted on by the light, and bends towards or from it, or disregards\r\nit, which ever may be most advantageous. During several days the\r\ntendrils, or internodes, or both, spontaneously revolve with a steady\r\nmotion. The tendril strikes some object, and quickly curls round and\r\nfirmly grasps it. In the course of some hours it contracts into a spire,\r\ndragging up the stem, and forming an excellent spring. All movements now\r\ncease. By growth the tissues soon become wonderfully strong and durable.\r\nThe tendril has done its work, and has done it in an admirable manner.\"\r\n\r\nThe labour of revising the successive editions of the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" together with prolonged ill-health, delayed the fulfilment of\r\nthe promise given in that work, that the facts upon which it was based\r\nshould be published. It was not till 1868 that the first instalment,\r\n\"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,\" was given to\r\nthe world, in two large volumes, with numerous illustrations. The\r\nauthor's design was to discuss in a second work the variability of\r\norganic beings in a state of nature, and the conversion of varieties\r\ninto species, the struggle for existence and the operation of natural\r\nselection, and the principal objections to the theory, including\r\nquestions of instinct and hybridisation. In a third work it was intended\r\nto test the principle of natural selection by the extent to which it\r\nexplains the geological succession of organic beings, their distribution\r\nin past and present times, and their mutual affinities and homologies.\r\nThe two latter works were never completed, in consequence of ill-health,\r\nand the labour involved in dealing with objections to and new facts in\r\nsupport of the \"Origin,\" and of the other works which at various times\r\nit became important to complete. But many portions of these subjects\r\nwere admirably dealt with by disciples. In some cases Darwin's views led\r\nto the rapid growth of a new science, such as that of comparative\r\nembryology, and it would not have been possible for him to cope with and\r\ninterpret the multitude of new and astonishing facts discovered, which\r\nchanged the face of organic nature as viewed by biologists. By doing\r\neach day the work which seemed most necessary, and which he could best\r\ndo, Darwin managed, in spite of his infirmity of constitution, to\r\ncomplete a larger body of original work, both in experiment and in\r\nthought, together with a greater quantity of bibliographical study and\r\ncollation of observed facts, than any Englishman perhaps has ever done.\r\n\r\nThe valuable book on \"Variation\" records and systematises a vast number\r\nof facts respecting all our principal domestic animals and cultivated\r\nplants. It gives evidence of wide reading, as well as great diligence in\r\nwriting letters of inquiry to all living authorities who could give\r\naccurate information. Very many visits were paid to zoological gardens,\r\nbreeders' establishments, nursery grounds, &c.; and the preparation of\r\nskulls, skins, &c., was a frequent occurrence in the Darwinian\r\nlaboratory. To take the case of rabbits alone, which occupied but a\r\nfraction of the time devoted to pigeons: over twenty works are quoted\r\nfor historical facts, skeletons of various rabbits were prepared and\r\nexhaustively compared, the effects of use and disuse of parts traced,\r\nmost careful measurements are given, and a list of the modifications\r\nwhich domestic rabbits have undergone, with the probable causes,\r\nconcludes the chapter. As to pigeons, no pigeon-fancier ought to be\r\nwithout the book, for never assuredly was a sporting topic treated by so\r\ngreat a thinker and so admirably. The numerous experiments in crossing\r\ndifferent breeds, and the results obtained, make this one of the most\r\ninstructive books for all breeders. It would seem desirable that this\r\nportion of the book should be issued in a separate form. Again, when we\r\nturn to the sections on plants we see how indefatigable Darwin was, for\r\nhe tells us that he cultivated fifty-four varieties of gooseberries\r\nalone, and compared them throughout in flower and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe chapters on Inheritance, and on Reversion to ancestral characters,\r\nor atavism, are profoundly suggestive. What can be more wonderful, the\r\nauthor asks, than that some trifling peculiarity should be transmitted\r\nthrough a long course of development, and ultimately reappear in the\r\noffspring when mature or even when old? Nevertheless, the real subject\r\nof surprise is not that a character should be inherited, but that any\r\nshould ever fail to be inherited. Gradually leading up to the important\r\nhypothesis with which the work closes, he observes that to adequately\r\nexplain the numerous characters that reappear after intervals of one or\r\nmore generations, we must believe that a vast number of characters,\r\ncapable of evolution, lie hidden in every organic being. \"The\r\nfertilised germ of one of the higher animals, subjected as it is to so\r\nvast a series of changes from the germinal cell to old age--incessantly\r\nagitated by what Quatrefages well calls the _tourbillon vital_--is\r\nperhaps the most wonderful object in nature. It is probable that hardly\r\na change of any kind affects either parent, without some mark being left\r\non the germ. But on the doctrine of reversion the germ becomes a far\r\nmore marvellous object, for, besides the visible changes to which it is\r\nsubjected, we must believe that it is crowded with invisible characters,\r\nproper to both sexes, to both the right and left side of the body, and\r\nto a long line of male and female ancestors separated by hundreds or\r\neven thousands of generations from the present time; and these\r\ncharacters, like those written on paper with invisible ink, all lie\r\nready to be evolved under certain known or unknown conditions.\"\r\n\r\nThrough a further discussion of many deeply interesting facts, about the\r\nintercrossing of breeds and species, and about the causes of\r\nvariability, we pass to the hypothesis of pangenesis, which, briefly\r\nstated, supposes that the cells or units of the body are perpetually\r\nthrowing off minute granules or gemmules, which accumulate in the\r\nreproductive system, and may, instead of developing in the next\r\ngeneration, be transmitted in a dormant state through more than one\r\ngeneration and then be developed. Combination in various degrees between\r\nthese gemmules is supposed to influence their appearance or\r\nnon-appearance in the offspring at various stages.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis certainly gives a picture of a possible mode of\r\naccounting for many peculiarities shown by living organisms. Although\r\nnot generally accepted, it has certainly not been disproved. Mr. Grant\r\nAllen's opinion that it is Darwin's \"one conspicuous failure,\" and that\r\nit is \"crude and essentially unphilosophic,\" must be discounted by his\r\nknown devotion to Mr. Herbert Spencer's philosophy. If Darwin had been a\r\nspecialist in modern physiology, he might, perhaps, have expressed his\r\nhypothesis in a more persuasive form; but Weismann's germ plasma theory\r\nis the only alternative one hitherto suggested in place of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the descent of man from animal ancestors was directly implied\r\nin the \"Origin of Species,\" Darwin hesitated at the time of its\r\npublication to declare his views fully, believing that he would only\r\nthus augment and concentrate the prejudice with which his theory would\r\nbe met. He had for many years held the views he afterwards expressed;\r\nbut it was not until he had by his other works raised up a strong body\r\nof scientific opinion in favour of his great generalisation, that he\r\nfully presented his views on man to the public. The \"Descent of Man\" was\r\nstudied as a special case of the application of his general principles,\r\na test all the more severe because several classes of argument were\r\nnecessarily cut off, such as the nature of the affinities which connect\r\ntogether whole groups of organisms, their geographical distribution, and\r\ntheir geological succession. But adopting the high antiquity of man as\r\ndemonstrated, he considered in detail the evidence as to man's descent\r\nfrom some pre-existing form, the manner of his development, and the\r\nvalue of the differences between the so-called races of man. No\r\noriginality is claimed for the theory or for the facts advanced; but it\r\nmay safely be affirmed that the master's acuteness, his moderation, his\r\ncandour, and his desire to state facts which tell against him, are as\r\nconspicuous in the \"Descent of Man\" as in any of his works.\r\n\r\nThe \"Descent of Man,\" which was published in 1871 in two volumes, with\r\nnumerous illustrations, began, after a short introduction, with a\r\nsuggestive series of questions, which to the evolutionist suffice to\r\ndecide the question as to man's origin. As the answers to these\r\nquestions are obvious, Darwin first concentrated his inquiry upon two\r\npoints on which disputes must necessarily occur, namely, the traces\r\nwhich man shows, in his bodily structure, of descent from some lower\r\nform, and the mental powers of man as compared with those of lower\r\nanimals. The facts of our bodily structure are inexplicable on any other\r\nview than our community of descent with the quadrumana, unless structure\r\nis but a snare to delude our reason. It is only our natural prejudice,\r\nsays Darwin, and that arrogance which made our fathers declare that they\r\nwere descended from demigods, which leads us to demur to this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the mental powers of animals with those of man,\r\nproving, as Darwin contends, that they therein also show traces of\r\ncommunity of descent, was certain to provoke much more debate, for the\r\nterm \"instinct\" and the use made of it by naturalists and psychologists\r\nas signifying untaught, unlearnt ability, largely tended to obscure the\r\nquestion, and to create prejudices against believing that instincts\r\ncould be built up by inherited experience, that instincts were really\r\nnot absolute and fixed, but relative and variable, and that all\r\ninstincts were not perfect or perfectly useful. The working out of the\r\nevolution theory as applied to animal minds, the study of the first\r\nbeginnings of nerve action, and the analysis of instinct, all due\r\nlargely to Darwin's prominent disciple, Romanes, together with the\r\nimmensely fuller knowledge of molecular physics, of protoplasm, and of\r\nbrain function, acquired in the years since Darwin wrote, have sufficed\r\nto place these questions on a much more secure basis. But the collection\r\nof facts made by him, and the suggestive remarks he everywhere makes,\r\nrender his book of permanent value. His sympathy is obvious in such\r\npassages as this: \"Every one has heard of the dog suffering under\r\nvivisection who licked the hand of the operator; this man, unless he had\r\na heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of his life;\"\r\nthe \"terrible\" superstitions of the past, such as human sacrifices,\r\ntrial by ordeal, &c., show us, he says, \"what an indefinite debt of\r\ngratitude we owe to the improvement of our reason, to science, and our\r\naccumulated knowledge.\" We see the fruit of Darwin's repeated visits to\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, especially in his study of the habits and mental\r\npowers of monkeys. We gain a definition from him of imagination, by\r\nwhich faculty man \"unites, independently of the will, former images and\r\nideas, and thus creates brilliant and novel results.... The value of the\r\nproducts of our imagination depends of course on the number, accuracy,\r\nand clearness of our impressions; on our judgment and taste in selecting\r\nor rejecting the involuntary combinations, and to a certain extent on\r\nour power of voluntarily combining them.\" As to religion, he says,\r\n\"There is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the\r\nennobling belief in the existence of an omnipotent God.\" On the\r\ncontrary, evidence proves that there are and have been numerous races\r\nwithout gods and without words to express the idea. The question, he\r\nsays, is \"wholly distinct from that higher one, whether there exists a\r\nCreator and Ruler of the universe; and this has been answered in the\r\naffirmative by the highest intellects that have ever lived.\" The fact of\r\nraces existing without a belief in a god is shown to be compatible with\r\nthe origin of religious ideas from attempts to explain external\r\nphenomena and man's own existence, by attributing to other objects and\r\nagencies a similar spirit to that which his consciousness testifies to\r\nin himself.\r\n\r\nMan's social qualities, as well as those of animals, Darwin regards as\r\nhaving been developed for the general good of the community, which he\r\ndefines as \"the means by which the greatest possible number of\r\nindividuals can be reared in full vigour and health, with all their\r\nfaculties perfect, under the conditions to which they are exposed.\" This\r\nmay be regarded as a more satisfactory expression of the idea underlying\r\nthe phrase, \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\" Sympathy\r\nfor animals he notes as one of the later acquisitions of mankind, and\r\nremarks that he found the very idea of humanity a novelty to the Gauchos\r\nof the Pampas. \"The highest stage in moral culture at which we can\r\narrive is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts....\r\nWhatever makes any bad action familiar to the mind, renders its\r\nperformance so much the easier\"--a significant expression for those who\r\nwould compare the teachings of Darwinism with those of Christianity.\r\nFinally, he concludes that the difference in mind between man and the\r\nhigher animals is one of degree, not of kind. \"At what age does\r\nthe new-born infant possess the power of abstraction, or become\r\nself-conscious and reflect on its own existence? We cannot answer; nor\r\ncan we answer in regard to the ascending organic scale.\" Yet that man's\r\nmental and moral faculties may have been gradually evolved \"ought not to\r\nbe denied, when we daily see their development in every infant; and when\r\nwe may trace a perfect gradation from the mind of an utter idiot, lower\r\nthan that of the lowest animal, to the mind of a Newton.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of natural selection on the variations known to occur in man,\r\nis next shown to be sufficient to account for his rise from a lowly\r\ncondition. Perhaps it is in discussing the development of the\r\nintellectual and moral faculties that Darwin is least successful; more\r\nknowledge of psychology than he possessed is demanded for this\r\ndiscussion. He gives up the problem of the first advance of savages\r\ntowards civilisation as \"at present much too difficult to be solved.\"\r\nHe, however, vigorously contests the idea that man was at first\r\ncivilised and afterwards degenerated; and expresses the opinion that the\r\n\"highest form of religion--the grand idea of God hating sin and loving\r\nrighteousness--was unknown during primeval times.\" Finally, after\r\ndiscussing the steps in the genealogy of man, he comes to the conclusion\r\nthat from the old-world monkeys, at a remote period, proceeded man, \"the\r\nwonder and glory of the universe.\" The early progenitors of man he\r\nbelieves to have been covered with hair, both sexes having had beards;\r\ntheir ears were pointed and capable of movement; their bodies were\r\nprovided with a tail, and the foot was probably prehensile. Our\r\nprimitive ancestors lived chiefly in trees in some warm forest-clad\r\nland, and the males were provided with formidable weapons in the shape\r\nof great canine teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" says Darwin, \"we have given to man a pedigree of prodigious\r\nlength, but not, it may be said, of noble quality. The world, it has\r\nbeen often remarked, appears as if it had long been preparing for the\r\nadvent of man; and this, in one sense, is strictly true, for he owes his\r\nbirth to a long line of progenitors. If any single link in this chain\r\nhad never existed, man would not have been exactly what he now is.\r\nUnless we wilfully close our eyes, we may, with our present knowledge,\r\napproximately recognize our parentage; nor need we feel ashamed of it.\r\nThe most humble organism is something much higher than the inorganic\r\ndust under our feet; and no one with an unbiassed mind can study any\r\nliving creature, however humble, without being struck with enthusiasm at\r\nits marvellous structure and properties.\"\r\n\r\nIn considering the formation and perpetuation of the races of mankind,\r\nDarwin was again and again baffled. He could not decide that any of the\r\nphysical differences between the races are of direct and special service\r\nto him, thus giving opportunity to natural selection to work. Hence he\r\nwas led to study in detail the effects of sexual selection, especially\r\nas applicable to man. The greater part of \"The Descent of Man\" is\r\noccupied with tracing out what may be called the history of courtship in\r\nman and animals. The great variety of interesting subjects dealt with\r\ncannot be detailed here. We must only notice a few points about mankind\r\nwhich are of special importance.\r\n\r\nDarwin concludes that man's predominance over woman in size, strength,\r\ncourage, pugnacity, and even energy was acquired in primeval times, and\r\nthat these advantages have been subsequently augmented chiefly through\r\nthe contests between men for women. Even man's intellectual vigour and\r\ninventiveness are probably due to natural selection, combined with\r\ninherited effects of habit, for the most able men will have succeeded\r\nbest in defending and providing for their wives and offspring. Beards,\r\nbeardlessness, voice, beauty are all related to sexual charm, and have\r\nbeen selectively developed. Early man, less licentious, not practising\r\ninfanticide, was in several respects better calculated to carry out\r\nsexual selection than he is now; and thus we find the various races of\r\nmen fully differentiated at the earliest date of historic records.\r\n\r\nIncidentally Darwin gives us his views on the mental differences between\r\nman and woman. Woman is more tender and less selfish than man, whose\r\nambition \"passes too easily into selfishness,\" which latter qualities\r\n\"seem to be his natural and unfortunate birthright.\" Woman's powers of\r\nintuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of imitation, are more\r\nstrongly marked than in man. Yet the chief pre-eminence of man he\r\nconsiders to consist in attaining greater success in any given line than\r\nwoman, by reason of greater energy, patience, &c. \"In order that woman\r\nshould reach the same standard as man, she ought, when nearly adult, to\r\nbe trained to energy and perseverance, and to have her reason and\r\nimagination exercised to the highest point, and then she would probably\r\ntransmit these qualities chiefly to her adult daughters.\" Here we have a\r\nplan of women's higher education according to the great evolutionist,\r\nalthough he does not assert that it is the essential and desirable one;\r\nbut given a certain object, here is the best method of securing it. \"The\r\nwhole body of women, however, could not be thus raised, unless during\r\nmany generations the women who excelled in the above robust virtues were\r\nmarried, and produced offspring in larger numbers than other women.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that man is descended from some less highly organised form,\r\nDarwin asserts in his concluding chapter, rests on grounds which will\r\nnever be shaken--namely, the similar structure and course of development\r\nof embryos of the higher animals, and vast numbers of facts of structure\r\nand constitution, rudimental structures, and abnormal reversions. The\r\nmental powers of the higher animals graduate into those of man.\r\nLanguage, and the use of tools, made man dominant. The brain then\r\nimmensely developed, and morality sprang from the social instinct.\r\nComparing and approving certain actions and disapproving others,\r\nremembering and looking back, he became conscientious and imaginative.\r\nSympathy, arising in the desire to give aid to one's fellows, was\r\nstrengthened by praise and blame, and conduces to happiness. \"As\r\nhappiness is an essential part of the general good, the greatest\r\nhappiness principle indirectly serves as a nearly safe standard of right\r\nand wrong.... But with the less civilised nations reason often errs,\r\nand many bad customs and base superstitions come within the same scope,\r\nand consequently are esteemed as high virtues and their breach as heavy\r\ncrimes.\"\r\n\r\nThe belief in God, the author says, is not innate or intuitive in man,\r\nbut only arises after long culture. As to the bearing of the evolution\r\ntheory on the immortality of the soul, Darwin thinks few people will\r\nfind cause for anxiety in the impossibility of determining at what\r\nperiod in the ascending scale man became an immortal being. \"The birth,\r\nboth of the species and of the individual, are equally parts of that\r\ngrand sequence of events, which our minds refuse to accept as the result\r\nof blind chance. The understanding revolts at such a conclusion.\"\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the Darwinian doctrine on some important practical\r\nquestions for society leads to the remark that, while man scans with\r\nscrupulous care the pedigree of his animals, when he comes to his own\r\nmarriage he rarely or never takes any such care. Perhaps Darwin was\r\nsomewhat in error here; and, also, he seems to have underrated the\r\nunconscious tendency to act according to natural law, which has no doubt\r\ninfluenced mankind largely. He lays down the principle that both sexes\r\nought to refrain from marriage if markedly inferior in body or mind, or\r\nif they cannot avoid abject poverty for their children. When the laws of\r\ninheritance are thoroughly known, he says, we shall not hear ignorant\r\nmembers of our legislature rejecting with scorn a plan for ascertaining,\r\nby an easy method, whether or not consanguineous marriages are injurious\r\nto man. But Darwin is by no means in favour of any restriction on man's\r\nnatural rate of increase; for it is the greatest means of preventing\r\nindolence from causing the race to become stagnant or to degenerate.\r\nOnly, there should be open competition for all men; and the most able\r\nshould not be prevented by laws or customs from succeeding best and\r\nrearing the largest number of offspring.\r\n\r\nIn summing up on the entire subject, Darwin expresses himself with more\r\nthan his wonted vigour and point. On the one hand, he endeavours to\r\ndisarm opposition by quoting heroic monkeys as contrasted with degraded\r\nbarbarians; on the other hand, he welcomes the elevation of man so far\r\nabove his barbarous ancestors. Finally, he takes his stand upon truth,\r\nas against likes and dislikes. \"The astonishment which I felt on first\r\nseeing a party of Fuegians on a wild and broken shore will never be\r\nforgotten by me, for the reflection at once rushed into my mind--such\r\nwere our ancestors. These men were absolutely naked and bedaubed\r\nwith paint; their long hair was tangled, their mouths frothed with\r\nexcitement, and their expression was wild, startled, and distrustful.\r\nThey possessed hardly any arts, and, like wild animals, lived on what\r\nthey could catch. They had no government, and were merciless to every\r\none not of their own small tribe. He who has seen a savage in his native\r\nland will not feel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the blood\r\nof some more humble creature flows in his veins. For my own part, I\r\nwould as soon be descended from that heroic little monkey, who braved\r\nhis dreaded enemy in order to save the life of his keeper; or from that\r\nold baboon, who, descending from the mountains, carried away in triumph\r\nhis young comrade from a crowd of astonished dogs--as from a savage who\r\ndelights to torture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices, practises\r\ninfanticide without remorse, treats his wives like slaves, knows no\r\ndecency, and is haunted by the grossest superstitions.\r\n\r\n\"Man may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen, though not\r\nthrough his own exertions, to the very summit of the organic scale; and\r\nthe fact of his having thus risen, instead of having been aboriginally\r\nplaced there, may give him hopes for a still higher destiny in the\r\ndistant future. But we are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only\r\nwith the truth as far as our reason allows us to discover it. I have\r\ngiven the evidence to the best of my ability; and we must acknowledge,\r\nas it seems to me, that man, with all his noble qualities, with sympathy\r\nwhich feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not\r\nonly to other men, but to the humblest living creature, with his\r\ngod-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and\r\nconstitution of the solar system--with all these exalted powers--Man\r\nstill bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly\r\norigin.\"\r\n\r\nThe reception accorded to \"The Descent of Man\" was more excited than\r\nthat of \"The Origin of Species.\" The first large edition was quickly\r\nexhausted, and discussion or ridicule of the book was the fashionable\r\nrecreation. _Mr. Punch_, week after week, reflected passing opinion. One\r\nof his Darwinian ballads on our ancestors is worth quoting from:--\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"They slept in a wood,\r\n             Or wherever they could,\r\n    For they didn't know how to make beds;\r\n             They hadn't got huts,\r\n             They dined upon nuts,\r\n    Which they cracked upon each other's heads.\r\n             They hadn't much scope\r\n             For a comb, brush, or soap,\r\n    Or towels, or kettle, or fire;\r\n             They had no coats nor capes,\r\n             For ne'er did these apes\r\n    Invent what they didn't require.\r\n\r\n       ·     ·     ·     ·     ·\r\n\r\n             From these though descended,\r\n             Our manners are mended,\r\n    Though still we can grin and backbite;\r\n             We cut up each other,\r\n             Be he friend or brother,\r\n    And tails are the fashion--at night.\r\n             This origination\r\n             Is all speculation--\r\n    We gamble in various shapes;\r\n             So Mr. Darwin\r\n             May speculate in\r\n    Our ancestors having been apes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Athenæum_ was unbelieving, but not denunciatory. _The Edinburgh\r\nReview_ declared the doctrine of natural selection hopelessly inadequate\r\nto explain the phenomena of man's body; although its truth and falsehood\r\nhad no necessary connection with the general theory of evolution: some\r\nlaw as yet unknown being looked for. Darwin's attempt to explain the\r\nevolution of mind and the moral sense is regarded as failing in every\r\npoint. \"Never, perhaps, in the history of philosophy, have such wide\r\ngeneralisations been derived from such a small basis of fact.\" _The\r\nQuarterly Review_ now acknowledged that \"the survival of the fittest\"\r\nwas a truth which readily presented itself to any one considering the\r\nsubject, and that to Darwin was due the credit of having first brought\r\nit forward and demonstrated its truth, and asserted that the destruction\r\nof the least fit was recognised thousands of years ago. But, in regard\r\nto the descent of man, it fastens specially upon the author's theory of\r\nmental and moral evolution, and declares that he has utterly failed.\r\n_The Saturday Review_, however, admitted the high antiquity of man, and\r\nthe nearness of his bodily structure to the apes, and went much further.\r\nIn discussing the evolution of morals, the author's unexampled grasp of\r\nfacts, with his power of correlation, is, according to _The Saturday_,\r\nseen at its highest, in an exquisite chain of philosophical deduction.\r\nThe mode in which, at a remote period, the races of mankind became\r\ndifferentiated, is declared to be the weak point in the argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\" followed \"The\r\nDescent of Man\" in 1872. The motive which suggested it was the desire to\r\nexplain the complexities of expression on evolution principles. But the\r\nstudy of emotional expression had evidently engaged Darwin's attention\r\nat least from the time when the Fuegians and the Gauchos had vividly\r\nroused his imaginative faculties; and his direct observations commenced\r\nas early as 1838; when he was already inclined to believe in evolution,\r\nand were continued at intervals ever after. The third edition of Sir\r\nCharles Bell's \"Anatomy of Expression,\" published in 1844, while greatly\r\nadmired by him, was unsatisfactory in being throughout based on the\r\nconviction that species came into existence in their present condition;\r\nand notwithstanding that Bain and Herbert Spencer had made considerable\r\nadvances in a treatment of the subject based on physiology, an\r\nexhaustive book was wanted, which should throw on Expression the new and\r\ninteresting light of Darwinism.\r\n\r\nWhat was Darwin's method? Observation, cleverly devised appeal to\r\nnature; observation over a wide field as to the varied races of man\r\nstill existing, utilising the aid of travellers and residents in many\r\nlands; observation of domestic animals in familiar and in untried\r\ncircumstances; observation of infants, especially his own, from a very\r\nearly age; observation of the insane, who are liable to the strongest\r\npassions, and give them uncontrolled vent. It was in 1867 that Darwin\r\ncirculated his group of questions designed to ascertain the mode of\r\nexpressing every emotion, and their physical concomitants in every\r\npossible race. Sculpture, paintings, and engravings, afforded little\r\nevidence, because beauty is their main object, and \"strongly contracted\r\nfacial muscles destroy beauty.\" Information was specially sought as to\r\nnatives who had had little communication with Europeans, and in whom\r\nimitation might not have destroyed ancestral and original expression.\r\n\r\nThe result was to develop three principles which appeared, in\r\ncombination, to account for most of the expressions and gestures\r\ninvoluntarily used by man and animals. The first was that of serviceable\r\nassociated habits: certain complex actions being somehow serviceable in\r\nparticular states of mind, to gratify and relieve certain sensations,\r\ndesires, &c., whenever the same state of feeling is repeated, there is a\r\ntendency to the same movements or actions, though they may not then be\r\nof the least use. The second principle, that of antithesis, is the\r\nconverse of the last; when an opposite state of mind is induced, there\r\nis an involuntary tendency to directly opposite movements, though of no\r\nuse. The third principle, that of the direct action of the nervous\r\nsystem, is independent of the will and of habit; nerve force being\r\ngenerated in excess by strong emotions.\r\n\r\nIn discussing all these principles we discover how every thought and\r\nevery circumstance of the great naturalist seem to have been utilised in\r\nhis life work. \"I have noticed that persons in describing a horrid\r\nsight, often shut their eyes momentarily and firmly, or shake their\r\nheads as if not to see, or to drive away, something disagreeable; and I\r\nhave caught myself, when thinking in the dark of a horrid spectacle,\r\nclosing my eyes firmly.\" \"I noticed a young lady earnestly trying to\r\nrecollect a painter's name, and she first looked to one corner of the\r\nceiling, and then to the opposite corner, arching the one eyebrow on\r\nthat side, although of course there was nothing to be seen there.\" \"Many\r\nyears ago I laid a small wager with a dozen young men that they would\r\nnot sneeze if they took snuff, although they all declared that they\r\ninvariably did so; accordingly they all took a pinch, but from wishing\r\nmuch to succeed, not one sneezed, though their eyes watered, and all,\r\nwithout exception, had to pay me the wager.\" \"I put my face close to the\r\nthick glass-plate in front of a puff-adder in the Zoological Gardens,\r\nwith the firm determination of not starting back if the snake struck at\r\nme; but as soon as the blow was struck, my resolution went for nothing,\r\nand I jumped a yard or two backwards with astonishing rapidity. My will\r\nand reason were powerless against the imagination of a danger which had\r\nnever been experienced.\" \"I observed that though my infants started at\r\nsudden sounds, when under a fortnight old, they certainly did not always\r\nwink their eyes, and I believe never did so. The start of an older\r\ninfant apparently represents a vague catching hold of something to\r\nprevent falling. I shook a pasteboard box close before the eyes of one\r\nof my infants, when 114 days old, and it did not in the least wink; but\r\nwhen I put a few comfits into the box, holding it in the same position\r\nas before, and rattled them, the child blinked its eyes violently every\r\ntime, and started a little.\" The behaviour of dogs and horses under many\r\ncircumstances was watched. Cats and monkeys were most carefully\r\nscrutinised. At all moments Darwin seized upon and recorded the passing\r\nemotion and its associated movements. \"I remember once seeing a boy who\r\nhad just shot his first snipe on the wing, and his hands trembled to\r\nsuch a degree from delight, that he could not for some time reload his\r\ngun;\" an instance of an emotional movement being disadvantageous.\r\n\r\nSome of Darwin's descriptions of emotional outbursts are among the best\r\nportions of his writing; as when he speaks of a mother whose infant has\r\nbeen intentionally injured, \"how she starts up with threatening aspect,\r\nhow her eyes sparkle and her face reddens, how her bosom heaves,\r\nnostrils dilate, and heart beats.\" In describing a mourner when\r\nquiescent, he says: \"The sufferer sits motionless, or gently rocks to\r\nand fro; the circulation becomes languid; respiration is almost\r\nforgotten, and deep sighs are drawn. All this reacts on the brain, and\r\nprostration soon follows with collapsed muscles and dulled eyes.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking features of this book is the evidence it\r\naffords of Darwin's acuteness and persistence in observation during his\r\ntravels, and of the excellence of his memory. \"I remember that my mules\r\nand dogs, brought from a lower and warmer country, after spending a\r\nnight on the bleak Cordillera, had the hair all over their bodies as\r\nerect as under the greatest terror.\" He noted that Jemmy Button, the\r\nFuegian, blushed when he was quizzed about the care which he took in\r\npolishing his shoes, and in otherwise adorning himself; and this fact\r\nlong after is fitted into the theory of blushing. Guanacoes in South\r\nAmerica, when not intending to bite, but merely to spit their offensive\r\nsaliva from a distance at an intruder, yet retract their ears as a sign\r\nof their anger; and Darwin found the hides of several which he shot in\r\nPatagonia, deeply scored by teeth marks, in consequence of their battles\r\nwith each other. A party of natives in Tierra del Fuego endeavoured to\r\nexplain that their friend, the captain of a sealing vessel, was out of\r\nspirits, by pulling down their cheeks with both hands, so as to make\r\ntheir faces as long as possible; and the fact is treasured till it comes\r\nin to illustrate the lengthening of features under depression. As if he\r\nforeknew that he should want the fact forty years later, he inquired of\r\nJemmy Button whether kissing was practised by his people, and learnt\r\nthat it was unknown to them. \"I remember,\" he says, \"being struck whilst\r\ntravelling in parts of South America, which were dangerous from the\r\npresence of Indians, how incessantly--yet as it appeared,\r\nunconsciously--the half-wild Gauchos closely scanned the whole horizon.\"\r\n\"In Tierra del Fuego, a native touched with his finger some cold\r\npreserved meat which I was eating at our bivouac, and plainly showed\r\nutter disgust at its softness; whilst I felt utter disgust at my food\r\nbeing touched by a naked savage, though his hands did not appear dirty.\"\r\nAnd this illustrates the primary meaning of disgust--anything offensive\r\nto the taste.\r\n\r\nIn later years his own children, and his domestic pets, were incessantly\r\nwatched, and suitable experiments were devised to bring out the real\r\nnature of their expressions. The period at which tears are formed and\r\ncrying begins, the shape of the mouth in crying, the contraction of the\r\nmuscles in shouting, the effects of steady gazing at objects, the\r\nvarious stages of smiling, the effects of shyness, shame, and fear, are\r\nall set before us, as thus observed. For instance, \"I asked one of my\r\nboys to shout as loudly as he possibly could, and as soon as he began he\r\nfirmly contracted his orbicular muscles (surrounding the eyes). I\r\nobserved this repeatedly, and on asking him why he had every time so\r\nfirmly closed his eyes, I found that he was quite unaware of the fact:\r\nhe had acted instinctively or unconsciously.\" Some of his early\r\nobservations were afterwards published by Darwin in _Mind_, vol. ii.,\r\nunder the title of \"A Biographical Sketch of an Infant.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a carefully-worded and very suggestive experiment on animals:\r\n\"Many years ago, in the Zoological Gardens, I placed a looking-glass on\r\nthe floor before two young orangs, who, as far as it was known, had\r\nnever before seen one. At first they gazed at their own images with the\r\nmost steady surprise, and often changed their point of view. They then\r\napproached close, and protruded their lips towards the image, as if to\r\nkiss it, in exactly the same manner as they had previously done towards\r\neach other when first placed, a few days before, in the same room. They\r\nnext made all sorts of grimaces, and put themselves in various\r\nattitudes before the mirror; they pressed and rubbed the surface; they\r\nplaced their hands at different distances behind it; looked behind it;\r\nand finally seemed almost frightened, started a little, became cross,\r\nand refused to look any longer.\" So monkeys were tested with a dressed\r\ndoll, a live turtle, and stuffed snakes, &c.\r\n\r\nThe mode and purpose of erection of the hair, feathers, and dermal\r\nappendages of animals were the subject of much careful inquiry.\r\nChimpanzees, monkeys, baboons, and many other creatures, were tested in\r\nthe Zoological Gardens. A stuffed snake taken into the monkey-house\r\ncaused several species to bristle. When Darwin showed the same to a\r\npeccary, the hair rose in a wonderful manner along its back. A cassowary\r\nerected its feathers at sight of an ant-eater.\r\n\r\nEvery unexpected occurrence was pressed into service. Witness the\r\nfollowing anecdote: \"One day my horse was much frightened at a drilling\r\nmachine, covered by a tarpaulin and lying on an open field. He raised\r\nhis head so high that his neck became almost perpendicular; and this he\r\ndid from habit, for the machine lay on a slope below, and could not have\r\nbeen seen with more distinctness through the raising of the head; nor if\r\nany sound had proceeded from it could the sound have been more\r\ndistinctly heard. His eyes and ears were directed intently forwards; and\r\nI could feel through the saddle the palpitations of his heart. With red,\r\ndilated nostrils, he snorted violently, and whirling round, would have\r\ndashed off at full speed had I not prevented him.\"\r\n\r\nWe see, too, in this book the results of Darwin's extensive reading.\r\nThe novelists are laid considerably under contribution, their power of\r\ndescribing expressive signs of emotion being particularly appreciated.\r\nDickens, Walter Scott, Mrs. Oliphant, and Mrs. Gaskell are among the\r\nnovelists quoted; while the author of Job, Homer, Virgil, Seneca,\r\nShakespeare, Lessing, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and many other deceased\r\nwriters, illustrate the subject. The living authorities--scientific men,\r\ntravellers, doctors--referred to for facts are exceedingly numerous,\r\nincluding Sir James Paget, Professor Huxley, Mr. Herbert Spencer, Sir J.\r\nCrichton Browne, Sir Samuel Baker, Sir Joseph Lister, Professors Cope\r\nand Asa Gray, and many others.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting chapters in the book is that dealing with\r\nblushing. It is shown to depend on self-attention, excited almost\r\nexclusively by the opinion of others. \"Every one feels blame more\r\nacutely than praise. Now, whenever we know, or suppose, that others are\r\ndepreciating our personal appearance, our attention is strongly drawn\r\ntowards ourselves, more especially to our faces.\" This excites the nerve\r\ncentres receiving sensory nerve for the face, and in turn relaxes the\r\nblood capillaries, and fills them with blood. \"We can understand why the\r\nyoung are much more affected than the old, and women more than men, and\r\nwhy the opposite sexes especially excite each others' blushes. It\r\nbecomes obvious why personal remarks should be particularly liable to\r\ncause blushing, and why the most powerful of all the causes is shyness;\r\nfor shyness relates to the presence and opinion of others, and the shy\r\nare always more or less self-conscious.\"\r\n\r\nOne great result made clear by Darwin is that the muscles of expression\r\nhave not been created or developed for the sake of expression only, and\r\nthat every true or inherited movement of expression had some natural or\r\nindependent origin. All the chief expressions are proved to be\r\nessentially the same throughout the world, which is an additional\r\nargument for man being descended from one stock. We cannot refrain from\r\nadmiring the tone of the pages which close the book, describing as they\r\ndo the probable expressions of our early ancestors, their utility, the\r\nvalue of differences of physiognomy, and the desirability or otherwise\r\nof repressing signs of emotion. The subject, says the author, \"deserves\r\nstill further attention, especially from any able physiologist;\" and so\r\nsimply ends a volume of surpassing human interest, a text-book for\r\nnovelists and students of human nature, a landmark in man's progress in\r\nobedience to the behest \"Know thyself.\"\r\n\r\nTo fully measure the merit of one so far elevated above ordinary men is\r\nalmost impossible; rather is it desirable to recognise the undeniable\r\ngreatness of a great man, and learn all that is possible from him. An\r\nundoubted authority in mental science, however, has given a judgment\r\non Darwin's services to that science, which it is right to quote:\r\n\"To ourselves it almost seems one of the most wonderful of the many\r\nwonderful aspects of Mr. Darwin's varied work that by the sheer force\r\nof some exalted kind of common-sense, unassisted by any special\r\nacquaintance with psychological method, he should have been able to\r\nstrike, as it were, straight down upon some of the most important\r\ntruths which have ever been brought to light in the region of mental\r\nscience.\"[12] These truths are specified as the influence of natural\r\nselection in the formation of instinct, in the \"Origin of Species;\" the\r\nevolution of mind and of morals, in the \"Descent of Man,\" considered by\r\nthe late Professor Clifford as containing the simplest and clearest and\r\nmost profound philosophy that was ever written on the subject; and the\r\nevolution of expression in the book described in this chapter. Thus,\r\nsays Mr. Romanes, in respect both of instincts and intelligence, the\r\nscience of comparative psychology may be said to owe its foundation to\r\nDarwin.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12: G. J. Romanes, in \"Charles Darwin,\" memorial notices\r\nreprinted from _Nature_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1875 appeared another great work from the master's pen,\r\n\"Insectivorous Plants,\" which was destined to place in a yet more\r\nstriking light the many-sidedness and fertility of his mind. As usual\r\nDarwin tells us that this work dated from many years back. \"During the\r\nsummer of 1860,\" he says, \"I was surprised by finding how large a number\r\nof insects were caught by the leaves of the common sun-dew (_Drosera\r\nrotundifolia_) on a heath in Sussex. I had heard that insects were thus\r\ncaught, but knew nothing further on the subject. I gathered by chance a\r\ndozen plants, bearing fifty-six fully expanded leaves, and on thirty-one\r\nof these dead insects or remnants of them adhered.\" Here was the germ of\r\nsomething, the discoverer scarcely knew what. It was evident to him that\r\nthe little sun-dew was excellently adapted for catching insects, and\r\nthat the number of them thus slaughtered annually must be enormous. What\r\nbearing might this have upon the problem of the struggle for existence?\r\n\r\nA masterly series of experiments was forthwith set on foot, with the\r\nresult of proving that sun-dews and a number of other plants obtain the\r\nbulk of their nourishment by catching, killing, and digesting insects.\r\nThey may be called truly carnivorous plants. What an unexpected\r\nreversal this was of the order of things hitherto believed to prevail\r\nuniversally. Animals live on other animals or on plants. Here were\r\nplants living on animals, and keeping down their number. Moreover,\r\nwithout a nervous system, the action of the parts of a sun-dew leaf was\r\nproved to be as apparently purposive as the combined action of the limbs\r\nof an animal. Without a stomach, the sun-dew poured forth a digestive\r\nfluid as effective in extracting and fitting the nutritious matter of\r\nthe insect for its own purposes as that of an animal. Without sensory\r\nnerve-endings, there was a percipient power in the sun-dew which\r\nrecognised instinctively and at once the non-nutritious nature of\r\nvarious objects, and which responded to the most delicate chemical\r\nstimuli and to the minutest weights.\r\n\r\nWe cannot describe the little sun-dew better than in Darwin's own words:\r\n\"It bears from two or three to five or six leaves, generally extended\r\nmore or less horizontally, but sometimes standing vertically upwards.\r\nThe leaves are commonly a little broader than long. The whole upper\r\nsurface is covered with gland-bearing filaments, or tentacles as I shall\r\ncall them from their manner of acting. The glands were counted on\r\nthirty-one leaves, but many of these were of unusually large size, and\r\nthe average number was 192; the greatest number being 260, and the least\r\n130. The glands are each surrounded by large drops of extremely viscid\r\nsecretion, which, glittering in the sun, have given rise to the plant's\r\npoetical name of the sun-dew.\"\r\n\r\nThis secretion, when excited by nutritious matter, becomes distinctly\r\nacid, and contains a digestive ferment allied to the pepsin of the human\r\nstomach. So excited, it is found capable of dissolving boiled white of\r\negg, muscle, fibrin, cartilage, gelatine, curd of milk, and many other\r\nsubstances. Further, various substances that animal gastric juice is\r\nunable to digest are not acted upon by the secretion of the sun-dew.\r\nThese include all horny matter, starch, fat, and oil. It is not however\r\nprejudiced in favour of animal matter. The sun-dew can absorb nutriment\r\nfrom living seeds of plants, injuring or killing them, of course, in the\r\nprocess, while pollen and fresh green leaves yield to its influence.\r\n\r\nThe action of salts of ammonia and other chemicals was even more\r\nwonderful. \"It is an astonishing fact that so inconceivably minute a\r\nquantity as the one twenty-millionth of a grain of phosphate of ammonia\r\nshould induce some change in a gland of Drosera sufficient to cause a\r\nmotor impulse to be sent down the whole length of the tentacle; this\r\nimpulse exciting movement often through an angle of above 180°. I know\r\nnot whether to be most astonished at this fact, or that the pressure of\r\na minute bit of hair, weighing only 1/78700 of a grain, and largely\r\nsupported by the dense secretion, should quickly cause conspicuous\r\nmovement.\"\r\n\r\nThese are but specimens of a multitude of profoundly interesting facts\r\nbrought out in this exhaustive investigation. If this single research\r\nwere his only title to fame Darwin's name must rank high as an\r\nexperimenter of rare ingenuity and success. But he concludes his summary\r\nof results by the utterly modest remark, \"We see how little has been\r\nmade out in comparison with what remains unexplained and unknown.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts relating to Venus' fly-trap (_Dionæa muscipula_) and other\r\nmembers of the order to which the sun-dew belongs were better known, but\r\nDarwin elicited new truths by his ingenious and varied experiments. The\r\nrapidity with which the two lobes of the leaf of dionæa close together\r\nwhen anything touches the tiny spikes which stand up vertically from the\r\nupper surface of the lobes, is astonishing, and any insect which causes\r\nthe closure is almost certain to be caught. Digestion is accomplished in\r\nthe case of the dionæa by a separate agency, consisting of a large\r\nnumber of minute reddish glands covering the surface of the lobes. These\r\nsecrete a digestive fluid when stimulated by the contact of any\r\nnitrogenous matter, and of course this takes place when any insect\r\nis caught. In fact, essentially the same process of digestion and\r\nabsorption takes place as in the sun-dew. The insect is held firmly for\r\ndays, until its juices have been absorbed, and then the leaf slowly\r\nreopens, not being able to close again for many subsequent days.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the extreme caution with which the great\r\nnaturalist speculates upon the mode by which the varied members of the\r\nsun-dew order became modified from an ordinary plant-form to such a\r\nremarkable degree. The details are too special for quotation here. He\r\nsuggests, but he does not in the slightest degree dogmatise. For many\r\nyears to come Darwin's suggestions and comments must be the pregnant\r\nsoil out of which fruitful research will spring, and his caution will\r\nremain the model, to depart from which will but sow hindrances in the\r\npath of scientific progress.\r\n\r\nThe order to which the butterwort and the bladderworts belong also\r\nafforded valuable results. The leaf of the butterwort bears glandular\r\nhairs, and its margins curve inwards when excited by contact of various\r\nbodies, especially living insects, and, at the same time, these are\r\ncaught in the viscid secretion of the glands, and their juices absorbed\r\nby the plant. The bladderworts are even more remarkably constructed, for\r\nthey have a portion of their leaves developed into subaqueous bladders,\r\nwith a narrow entrance beneath, defended by a complex valve, which\r\nfacilitates the entrance of water insects or crustaceans, but prevents\r\ntheir exit. The whole interior of the bladder is lined with transparent\r\nfour-branched protoplasmic hairs, but nevertheless the bladderwort is\r\nunlike the preceding plants in having no power of digesting its prey,\r\nhowever long it may remain in captivity. Yet there is no doubt that the\r\nimprisoned creatures do decay in their watery cell, and that the hairs\r\njust described absorb the products of their decay.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of Darwin's work on \"Insectivorous Plants.\" With\r\nhis characteristic expressions he acknowledges the valuable aid given\r\nhim by Professor Burdon-Sanderson, and by his son, Mr. Francis Darwin.\r\nThe former was enabled to give the first brief account of the process of\r\ndigestion in these plants, as observed by Darwin, in a lecture before\r\nthe Royal Institution, in June, 1874, and Dr. (now Sir Joseph) Hooker\r\ncalled general public notice to the subject of Carnivorous Plants in his\r\nlecture before the British Association at Belfast in the same year: so\r\nthat a thoroughly awakened attention was given to this new work from\r\nDarwin's pen. The public and the scientific world learnt to appreciate\r\nyet more keenly his varied talent, his long patience, his reserve of\r\npower; and thence dated very definitely a general appreciation of the\r\nfundamental unity of the animal and plant kingdoms, seeing that the\r\nsalient faculties of digestion, of purposive locomotion, of rapid\r\ncommunication and consentaneous action were no longer restricted to\r\nanimals, but were possessed in a high degree by plants also. Eager\r\nfollowers soon brought forward further proofs of unity of functions in\r\nthe two kingdoms, and of reciprocal combinations between them, and now\r\nno one in the slightest degree acquainted with modern biology doubts\r\nthat life is at bottom one phenomenon, shared equally and manifested in\r\nessentially the same modes by the living substance of plant and animal\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nFollowing \"Insectivorous Plants\" came \"The Effects of Cross and\r\nSelf-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom,\" in 1876. Darwin had led\r\nthe way in the study of this subject by his book on Orchids, and his\r\nlead had been excellently followed by Hildebrand, Hermann Müller, Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock, and others. The path having been indicated, it had\r\nappeared comparatively easy for botanists to follow it up. But there yet\r\nremained a region of experimental inquiry which it required Darwin's\r\npatience and ingenuity to master and to expound conclusively. Although\r\nit might be practically granted that natural selection developed\r\na process because advantage was gained by it, was it possible to\r\ndemonstrate that flowers cross-fertilised bear more and larger seeds,\r\nwhich produce healthier offspring than those fertilised from their own\r\npollen? This Darwin set himself exhaustively to do. For more than a\r\ndozen years after his book on orchids appeared, unwearied experiments\r\non plants were progressing, and nature was being questioned acutely,\r\nuntiringly. Competitive germination was carried on. The two classes of\r\nseeds were placed on damp sand in a warm room. As often as a pair\r\ngerminated at the same time, they were planted on opposite sides of the\r\nsame pot, with a partition between. Besides these pairs of competitors,\r\nothers were planted in beds, so that the descendants of the crossed\r\nand self-fertilised flowers might compete. The resulting seeds were\r\ncarefully compared, and their produce again compared. Species were\r\nselected from widely distinct families, inhabiting various countries.\r\nFrom a large number of plants, when insects were quite excluded by a\r\nthin net covering the plant, few or no seeds were produced. The extent\r\nof transport of pollen by insects was unveiled, and the relation between\r\nthe structure, odour, and conspicuousness of flowers, the visits of\r\ninsects, and the advantages of cross-fertilisation was shown. \"We\r\ncertainly,\" says Darwin, \"owe the beauty and odour of our flowers, and\r\nthe storage of a large supply of honey, to the existence of insects.\"\r\nThe multitude of facts gathered about insects could only have been\r\ndiscovered and rightly appreciated by one who was a true entomologist\r\nas well as a botanist.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter of the book the author discusses with remarkable\r\npower the causes of the phenomena he has discovered. He believes that\r\nthe favourable effects of crossing are due to the parents having been\r\nsubjected to diverse conditions; but what the precise benefit is, or how\r\nit can operate so as to render the offspring more healthy and vigorous,\r\nhe cannot discern. \"And so it is,\" he observes, \"with many other facts,\r\nwhich are so obscure that we stand in awe before the mystery of life.\"\r\nSo it is. The man who probably understood nature better than any man who\r\nhas ever lived, who had not only asked her multitudinous questions, but\r\nto whom very many answers had been undoubtedly vouchsafed in response to\r\nhis persevering, humble, diligent, acute questioning, acknowledges that\r\nhe knows little; that much remains a mystery. But from all we know of\r\nhim, from his books, his letters, his friends, his was the joy of a\r\nsoul in sympathy with the master power of the universe. He marched\r\ncontinually on the confines of the unknown, and to him was granted the\r\nfelicity of largely extending the boundaries of the known.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1877, a new work proceeded from Darwin's pen, \"The Different\r\nForms of Flowers in Plants of the same Species,\" dedicated to Professor\r\nAsa Gray. It gathered up the contents of numerous papers read before the\r\nLinnean Society, with later additions, and showed conclusively how many\r\nplants possess distinctive forms of flowers in the same species, adapted\r\nto, and in some cases absolutely necessitating, reciprocal fertilisation\r\nthrough the visits of insects. It gave evidence of all the well-known\r\nDarwinian characteristics of long-continued labour, thought, and\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 \"The Power of Movement in Plants\" was exemplified in a fresh\r\nvolume, in which the veteran was materially assisted by his son, Mr.\r\nFrancis Darwin. Its object was to describe and connect together several\r\nlarge classes of movements, common to almost all plants. The surprising\r\nfact was established, that all the parts or organs of plants, whilst\r\nthey continue to grow, are continually revolving, or circumnutating as\r\nDarwin called it. This movement commences even before the young seedling\r\nhas broken through the ground. The combination of this with the effects\r\nof gravity and light explains countless phenomena in the life of plants.\r\nThe tip of the rootlet is thus enabled to penetrate the ground, and it\r\nis proved to be more sensitive than the most delicate tendril. Movement\r\ngoes on through all stages of life. Every growing shoot of a great tree\r\nis continually describing small ellipses; the tip of every rootlet\r\nendeavours to do the same. The changes of position of leaves and of\r\nclimbing plants, and the sleep of leaves are all brought under this\r\ngreat principle of circumnutation. It is impossible in reading the book\r\nnot to be struck with the great resemblance between the movements of\r\nplants and many of the actions performed unconsciously by the lower\r\nanimals. \"With plants an astonishingly small stimulus suffices, and,\r\neven with allied plants, one may be highly sensitive to the slightest\r\ncontinued pressure, and another highly sensitive to a slight momentary\r\ntouch. The habit of moving at certain periods is inherited both by\r\nplants and animals, and several other points of similitude have been\r\nspecified. But the most striking resemblance is the localisation of\r\ntheir sensitiveness, and the transmission of an influence from the\r\nexcited part to another which consequently moves. Yet plants do not\r\nof course possess nerves or a central nervous system; and we may\r\ninfer that with animals such structures serve only for the more\r\nperfect transmission of impressions, and for the more complete\r\nintercommunication of the several parts.\"\r\n\r\nHere we see how much light may be thrown on animal structures and\r\nfunctions by vegetable physiology. We learn to limit our ideas of the\r\nsuperiority of animals by discovering how much of what we consider\r\npeculiar to them is found in plants. We appreciate the unity of biology,\r\nindivisible without injury to our knowledge of its parts. No structure\r\nin plants appears more wonderful, as Darwin describes it, than the\r\ntip of the rootlet of a seedling. It is impressed by and transmits\r\ninfluences of pressure, injury, moisture, light, and gravity to other\r\nparts, and determines the course pursued by the rootlet in penetrating\r\nthe ground. \"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the\r\nradicle thus endowed, and having the power of directing the movements of\r\nthe adjoining parts, acts like the brain of one of the lower animals;\"\r\nand the brain of Charles Darwin, in working out this acquisition of\r\nknowledge for mankind, has added a new department to vegetable\r\nphysiology and to biology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his later years honours poured thick upon Darwin. In 1871 he received\r\nthe Prussian order of knighthood \"For Merit\"; and was elected a\r\ncorresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 1877\r\nCambridge University, making an exception to its custom of not\r\nconferring honorary degrees on its members, gave him the LL.D. and an\r\novation, when the kindly eyes of the venerable naturalist beamed upon\r\nthe monkey-figure dangled by undergraduates before him from the\r\ngalleries, in addition to a solitary link of a huge chain, no doubt\r\nrepresenting \"the missing link.\" In 1878 the honour, long withheld, and\r\ncertainly unsought, of being elected a corresponding member of the Paris\r\nAcademy of Sciences in the section of Zoology, was his; and that tardy\r\nbody recognised late the man whose supremacy in science it had done\r\nnothing either to foster or to approve. In 1879 the Baly Medal of the\r\nLondon College of Physicians was awarded to him.\r\n\r\nAfter the Cambridge celebration a subscription was raised to obtain a\r\nportrait of the veteran evolutionist, which was executed by Mr. W. B.\r\nRichmond, and now adorns the Philosophical Library of the New Museums at\r\nCambridge. Later, yet another portrait--the finest in his own and many\r\nothers' belief--was painted by Mr. John Collier, and presented to\r\nthe Linnean Society, which will always be associated with the first\r\nannouncement of Darwin's main theory, as well as with many others of his\r\nscientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nProfessor Haeckel has given the following charming description of Darwin\r\nand his home surroundings in his later years: \"In Darwin's own carriage,\r\nwhich he had thoughtfully sent for my convenience to the railway\r\nstation, I drove, one sunny morning in October, through the graceful,\r\nhilly landscape of Kent, that with the chequered foliage of its woods,\r\nwith its stretches of purple heath, yellow broom, and evergreen oaks,\r\nwas arrayed in its fairest autumnal dress. As the carriage drew up in\r\nfront of Darwin's pleasant country house, clad in a vesture of ivy and\r\nembowered in elms, there stepped out to meet me from the shady porch,\r\novergrown with creeping plants, the great naturalist himself, a tall and\r\nvenerable figure, with the broad shoulders of an Atlas supporting a\r\nworld of thought, his Jupiter-like forehead highly and broadly arched,\r\nas in the case of Goethe, and deeply furrowed with the plough of mental\r\nlabour; his kindly, mild eyes looking forth under the shadow of\r\nprominent brows; his amiable mouth surrounded by a copious silver-white\r\nbeard. The cordial, prepossessing expression of the whole face, the\r\ngentle, mild voice, the slow, deliberate utterance, the natural and\r\nnaive train of ideas which marked his conversation, captivated my whole\r\nheart in the first hour of our meeting, just as his great work had\r\nformerly, on my first reading it, taken my whole understanding by storm,\r\nI fancied a lofty world-sage out of Hellenic antiquity--a Socrates or\r\nAristotle--stood before me.\"\r\n\r\nThe well-known botanist, Alphonse de Candolle, thus describes a visit to\r\nDown:\r\n\r\n     \"I longed to converse once more with Darwin, whom I had seen in\r\n     1839, and with whom I kept up a most interesting correspondence. It\r\n     was on a fine autumn morning in 1880 that I arrived at Orpington\r\n     station, where my illustrious friend's break met me. I will not\r\n     here speak of the kind reception given to me at Down, and of the\r\n     pleasure I felt in chatting familiarly with Mr. and Mrs. Darwin and\r\n     their son Francis. I note only that Darwin at seventy was more\r\n     animated and appeared happier than when I had seen him forty-one\r\n     years before. His eye was bright and his expression cheerful,\r\n     whilst his photographs show rather the shape of his head, like that\r\n     of an ancient philosopher. His varied, frank, gracious\r\n     conversation, entirely that of a gentleman, reminded me of that of\r\n     Oxford and Cambridge _savants_. The general tone was like his\r\n     books, as is the case with sincere men, devoid of every trace of\r\n     charlatanism. He expressed himself in English easily understood by\r\n     a foreigner, more like that of Bulwer or Macaulay, than that of\r\n     Dickens or Carlyle. I asked him for news of the committee, of which\r\n     he was a member, for reforming English spelling, and when I said\r\n     that moderate changes would be best received by the public, he\r\n     laughingly said, 'As for myself, _of course_, I am for the most\r\n     radical changes.' We were more in accord on another point, that a\r\n     man of science, even up to advanced age, ought to take an interest\r\n     in new ideas, and to accept them, if he finds them true. 'That was\r\n     very strongly the opinion of my friend Lyell,' he said; 'but he\r\n     pushed it so far as sometimes to yield to the first objection, and\r\n     I was then obliged to defend him against himself.' Darwin had more\r\n     firmness in his opinions, whether from temperament, or because he\r\n     had published nothing without prolonged reflection.\r\n\r\n     \"Around the house no trace appeared to remain of the former labours\r\n     of the owner. Darwin used simple means. He was not one who would\r\n     have demanded to have palaces built in order to accommodate\r\n     laboratories. I looked for the greenhouse in which such beautiful\r\n     experiments on hybrid plants had been made. It contained only a\r\n     vine. One thing struck me, although it is not rare in England,\r\n     where animals are loved. A heifer and a colt were feeding close to\r\n     us with the tranquillity which tells of good masters, and I heard\r\n     the joyful barking of dogs. 'Truly,' I said to myself, 'the history\r\n     of the variations of animals was written here, and observations\r\n     must be going on, for Darwin is never idle.' I did not suspect that\r\n     I was walking above the dwellings of those lowly beings called\r\n     earthworms, the subject of his last work, in which Darwin showed\r\n     once more how little causes in the long run produce great effects.\r\n     He had been studying them for thirty years, but I did not know it.\r\n\r\n     \"Returning to the house, Darwin showed me his library, a large room\r\n     on the ground floor, very convenient for a studious man; many books\r\n     on the shelves; windows on two sides; a writing-table and another\r\n     for apparatus for his experiments. Those on the movements of stems\r\n     and roots were still in progress. The hours passed like minutes. I\r\n     had to leave. Precious memories of that visit remain.\"\r\n\r\nYet once more, in 1881, the famous publishing house of Murray issued a\r\nnew work--his last--by the great illuminator of Nature. Its subject was\r\none which no one save those who knew him could have expected. It dealt\r\nwith \"The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Action of Worms,\r\nwith Observations on their Habits,\" and in it the lowly earthworm was at\r\nlast raised to its true rank as the genuine preparer and possessor of\r\nthe soil. Both Gilbert White and Edward Jenner had been impressed with\r\nthe work earthworms do in nature, but no one had written extensively on\r\nthe subject till Darwin himself, in 1837, read a short paper on the\r\n\"Formation of Mould\" before the Geological Society of London (published\r\nin the fifth volume of the Society's Transactions), showing that small\r\nfragments of burnt marl, cinders, &c., which had been thickly strewed\r\nover the surface of several meadows, were found after a few years lying\r\nat the depth of some inches beneath the turf. It was suggested to him by\r\nhis relative Mr. Wedgwood, of Maer Hall, in Staffordshire, that this was\r\ndue to the quantity of fine earth continually brought up to the surface\r\nby worms in the form of castings. Observation and experiment were to\r\nsettle the question in the usual Darwinian manner, and many a portion of\r\nsoil was watched. One experiment lasted nearly thirty years, for a\r\nquantity of broken chalk and sifted coal cinders was spread on December\r\n20, 1842, over distinct parts of a field near Down House, which had\r\nexisted as pasture for a very long time. At the end of November, 1871, a\r\ntrench was dug across this part of the field, and the nodules of chalk\r\nwere found buried seven inches. A similar change took place in a field\r\ncovered with flints, where in thirty years the turf was compact without\r\nany stones. A pathway formed of loose-set flagstones was similarly\r\nburied by worms, and became undistinguishable from the rest of the lawn.\r\nAnd these are but a few of the evidences of the wonderful action of\r\nworms, collected by the activity of Charles Darwin and his sons.\r\n\r\nEarthworms were not only scrutinised in their out-of-door work, but were\r\nkept in confinement and studied. It appears they swallow earth both to\r\nmake their burrows and to extract all nutriment it may contain; they\r\nwill eat almost anything they can get their skin over. From careful\r\ncalculation it was shown that worms on an average pass ten tons of the\r\nsoil on an acre of ground through their bodies every year. It is, then,\r\nbut a truism to say that every bit of soil on the surface of the globe\r\nmust have passed through their bodies many times. They were discovered\r\nto work mainly by night, when hundreds may with care be discerned, with\r\ntails fixed in their burrows, prowling round in circles, rapidly\r\nretreating into holes, and strongly resisting efforts to extract them.\r\nIt was found by careful study that they have no sense of hearing, but a\r\nmost remarkable sensitiveness to vibrations of the earth or even\r\nto contact with air in motion. No book Darwin wrote was fuller of\r\ninteresting and undoubtedly correct observations.\r\n\r\nIn concluding, the author enforces the claims of worms on the gratitude\r\nof archæologists, as they protect and preserve for an indefinitely long\r\nperiod every object not liable to decay which is dropped on the surface\r\nof the land, by burying it beneath their castings. It is thus that many\r\ntesselated pavements and other ancient remains have been preserved; but,\r\non the other hand, worms have undermined many old massive walls and\r\ncaused them to subside, and no building is in this respect safe unless\r\nthe foundations are at least six or seven feet beneath the surface,\r\nbelow which depth worms cannot work. Worms also prepare the ground in an\r\nexcellent manner for plant life, periodically exposing the mould to the\r\nair, sifting it so that no stones larger than the particles they can\r\nswallow are left in it, mingling the whole intimately together, burying\r\nall decaying objects within reach of the roots of the plants, allowing\r\nair to penetrate deeply into the earth. \"When we behold a wide,\r\nturf-covered expanse, we should remember that its smoothness, on which\r\nso much of its beauty depends, is mainly due to all the inequalities\r\nhaving been slowly levelled by worms. It is a marvellous reflection that\r\nthe whole of the superficial mould over any such expanse has passed, and\r\nwill again pass, every few years through the bodies of worms. The plough\r\nis one of the most ancient and most valuable of man's inventions; but\r\nlong before he existed the land was in fact regularly ploughed, and\r\nstill continues to be thus ploughed by earthworms. It may be doubted\r\nwhether there are many other animals which have played so important\r\na part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organised\r\ncreatures.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this last book Darwin felt much exhausted, and wrote: \"I feel\r\nso worn out that I do not suppose I shall ever again give reviewers\r\ntrouble.\" His brother Erasmus's death in the same year was the severance\r\nof a link with early days. Yet for some months he continued in a\r\nmoderate degree of health, still working. For some weeks however in the\r\nfollowing March and April he was slightly unwell, and the action of his\r\nheart became so weak that he was not allowed to mount the stairs. On\r\nTuesday, April 18, he was in his study examining a plant which he had\r\nhad brought to him, and he read the same evening before retiring. Till\r\nthe day of his death he did not become seriously ill. On that day the\r\nheart, which had so long done its duty, failed, and about 4 p.m.,\r\non April 19, 1882, Charles Darwin breathed his last in peace, aged\r\nseventy-three years, two months, and seven days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Charles Darwin focussed, as it were, into one concentrated\r\nglow the feelings of admiration, and even reverence, which had been\r\ngrowing stronger and stronger in the years since the \"Origin of Species\"\r\nwas published. It soon became evident that a public funeral in\r\nWestminster Abbey was very generally called for, and this being granted,\r\na grave was chosen in the north aisle and north-east corner of the nave,\r\nnorth of and side by side with that of Sir John Herschel, and ten or\r\ntwelve feet only from that of Sir Isaac Newton. On April 26, 1882, a\r\ngreat representative host of scientists, literary men, politicians, and\r\ntheologians assembled for the final scene. The pallbearers were the\r\nDukes of Devonshire and Argyll, the Earl of Derby, Mr. J. Russell Lowell\r\n(then American Minister in London), Mr. W. Spottiswoode (President of\r\nthe Royal Society), Sir Joseph Hooker, Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace,\r\nProfessor Huxley, Sir John Lubbock, and Canon Farrar. The Bishop of\r\nCarlisle, preaching at the Abbey on the following Sunday, admitted that\r\nDarwin had produced a greater change in the current of thought than\r\nany other man, and had done it by perfectly legitimate means. He had\r\nobserved Nature with a strength of purpose, pertinacity, honesty, and\r\ningenuity never surpassed.\r\n\r\n\"The career of Charles Darwin,\" wrote _The Times_ on the day of his\r\nfuneral, \"eludes the grasp of personal curiosity as much as of personal\r\nenmity. He thought, and his thoughts have passed into the substance of\r\nfacts of the universe. A grass plot, a plant in bloom, a human gesture,\r\nthe entire circle of the doings and tendencies of nature, builds his\r\nmonument and records his exploits.... The Abbey has its orators and\r\nministers who have convinced senates and swayed nations. Not one of them\r\nall has wielded a power over men and their intelligences more complete\r\nthan that which for the last twenty-three years has emanated from a\r\nsimple country house in Kent. Memories of poets breathe about the mighty\r\nchurch. Science invokes the aid of imagination no less than poetry.\r\nDarwin as he searched, imagined. Every microscopic fact his patient eyes\r\nunearthed, his fancy caught up and set in its proper niche in a fabric\r\nas stately and grand as ever the creative company of Poets' Corner wove\r\nfrom sunbeams and rainbows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our century is Darwin's century,\" said the _Allgemeine Zeitung_. _The\r\nNew York Herald_ described his life as \"that of Socrates except its\r\nclose.\" The _Neue Freie Presse_ said truly that his death caused\r\nlamentation as far as truth had penetrated, and wherever civilisation\r\nhad made any impression.\r\n\r\nA movement was at once set on foot for securing a worthy public memorial\r\nof Darwin. Subscriptions flowed in abundantly, and came from all\r\ncountries of Europe, the United States, the British Colonies, and\r\nBrazil. Sweden sent the astonishing number of 2296 subscriptions;\r\npersons of all ranks contributed, from a bishop to a seamstress. Over\r\n£4,000 in all was subscribed, and it was resolved, in the first place,\r\nto procure the best possible statue. This work was entrusted to Mr.\r\nBoehm, R.A., with admirable results. Permission was obtained to place it\r\nin the great hall of the British Museum of Natural History, South\r\nKensington, and here it was unveiled on June 9, 1885, by the Prince of\r\nWales, who accepted the statue on behalf of the Trustees of the British\r\nMuseum from Professor Huxley as representing the subscribers. It is\r\nagreed that the statue is excellent, the attitude easy and dignified,\r\nthe expression natural and characteristic. The only defect is that the\r\nhands are unlike Darwin's. The balance, about £2,200, remaining over\r\nfrom the fund, was given to the Royal Society to be invested for the\r\npromotion of biological studies and researches.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which Darwin lived were just those in which, as\r\n_The Saturday Review_ put it, his sweet and gentle nature could blossom\r\ninto perfection. \"Arrogance, irritability, and envy, the faults\r\nthat ordinarily beset men of genius, were not so much conquered as\r\nnon-existent in a singularly simple and generous mind. It never occurred\r\nto him that it would be to his gain to show that he and not some one\r\nelse was the author of a discovery. If he was appealed to for help by a\r\nfellow-worker, the thought never passed into his mind that he had\r\nsecrets to divulge which would lessen his importance. It was science,\r\nnot the fame of science, that he loved, and he helped science by the\r\ntemper in which he approached it. He had to say things which were\r\ndistasteful to a large portion of the public, but he won the ear even of\r\nhis most adverse critics by the manifest absence of a mere desire to\r\nshine, by his modesty, and by his courtesy. He told honestly what he\r\nthought to be the truth, but he told it without a wish to triumph or to\r\nwound. There is an arrogance of unorthodoxy as well as an arrogance of\r\northodoxy, and if ideas that a quarter of a century ago were regarded\r\nwith dread are now accepted without a pang, the rapidity of the change\r\nof opinion, if not the change itself, is largely due to the fact that\r\nthe leading exponent of these ideas was the least arrogant of men.\"\r\n\r\nGeniality and genuine humour must be remembered as among the many\r\ndelightful traits in Darwin's character. Mr. Edmund Yates, in his\r\n\"Celebrities at Home\" (second series), describes his as a laugh to\r\nremember, \"a rich Homeric laugh, round and full, musical and jocund.\"\r\n\"At a droll suggestion of Mr. Huxley's, or a humorous doubt insinuated\r\nin the musical tones of the President of the Royal Society (Sir Joseph\r\nHooker), the eyes twinkle under the massive overhanging brows, the\r\nSocratic head, as Professor Tyndall loves to call it, is thrown back,\r\nand over the long white beard rolls out such a laugh as we have\r\nattempted to describe.\"\r\n\r\nExceptionally good-hearted and sympathetic as a man, Darwin discovered\r\nhis life-work, and did it, in spite of a most powerful hindrance, in the\r\nbest possible manner, with the least possible waste of force. But, more\r\nthan doing his work, he set others to work, incited them, suggested to\r\nthem, aided them, scattered among them seeds which, finding fertile\r\nsoil, sprang up and bore fruit a hundredfold. His greatness is as much\r\nin what be caused others to do as in what he did himself. Even in\r\narousing antagonism, though by the gentlest means, he did a great work,\r\nfor he secured examination and criticism in such bulk that the whole\r\nworld was leavened by his doctrine; and in controversy no man has any\r\ndisagreeable reminiscence of him. Many have cause to bless the day when\r\nthey first came into communication with Darwin, to find him welcome\r\nthem, encourage them, place his own vast stores of knowledge and thought\r\nat their disposal, and, best of all, make them love him naturally as a\r\ndear friend.\r\n\r\nDarwin's was one of those open and frank minds which are entrenched\r\nbehind no rampart of isolating prejudice, and elevated on no platform of\r\nconscious superiority. It was equally natural to him to ask and to give\r\ninformation. No one ever was more accessible to all who genuinely sought\r\nhis aid in their inquiries or their projects; no one ever more truly\r\nsought information from all quarters whence truth was attainable. Hence\r\nthe mass of his letters to all kinds of persons is enormous, and only a\r\nsmall proportion, probably, will ever be published. His letters are like\r\nhis conversation, free, frank, without a trace of _arrière pensée_,\r\npraising others where possible--and no man ever found it more possible\r\nto praise others more genuinely--depreciating himself and his work most\r\nunduly. \"You so overestimate the value of what I do,\" he writes on\r\none occasion, \"that you make me feel ashamed of myself, and wish to\r\nbe worthy of such praise.\" Again, \"You have indeed passed a most\r\nmagnificent eulogium on me, and I wonder that you were not afraid of\r\nhearing 'oh, oh,' or some other sign of disapprobation. Many persons\r\nthink that what I have done in science has been much overrated, and\r\nI very often think so myself, but my comfort is that I have never\r\nconsciously done anything to gain applause.\" Here we see the scientific\r\nman occupying the highest possible moral standpoint as a seeker after\r\ntruth. His election as one of the honorary members of the Physiological\r\nSociety was to him a \"wholly unexpected honour,\" and a \"mark of\r\nsympathy\" which pleased him in a very high degree.\r\n\r\n\"Work,\" he writes on another occasion, \"is my sole pleasure in life.\"\r\n\"It is so much more interesting to observe than to write.\" So long as he\r\ncould devise experiments and mark the results he continued to do\r\nit, rather than prepare his voluminous notes on many subjects for\r\npublication. \"Trollope, in one of his novels, gives as a maxim of\r\nconstant use by a brickmaker, 'It is dogged as does it,' and I have\r\noften and often,\" wrote Darwin, \"thought this is a motto for every\r\nscientific worker.\" How faithfully he adopted it himself those who read\r\nthrough any one of his experimental books can appreciate. He habitually\r\nread or heard some good novel as a recreation, and took a by no means\r\nrestricted interest in general literature.\r\n\r\nConsidering how usual it is for leading thinkers to be drawn into\r\ncontroversy, even when most desirous of avoiding it, it is remarkable\r\nhow little Darwin was mixed up with hotly-debated questions. \"I hate\r\ncontroversy,\" he writes, \"and it wastes much time, at least with a man\r\nwho, like myself, can work for only a short time in a day.\" One of the\r\nfew occasions on which he appeared as a champion of a cause was on the\r\nquestion of vivisection, in which a chivalrous feeling led him to\r\nintervene with the following letter to Professor Holmgren, of Upsala\r\nUniversity, which was published in _The Times_ of April 18, 1881. \"I\r\nthought it fair,\" he wrote, \"to bear my share of the abuse poured in so\r\natrocious a manner on all physiologists.\"\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,--In answer to your courteous letter of April 7, I have\r\n     no objection to express my opinion with respect to the right of\r\n     experimenting on living animals. I use this latter expression as\r\n     more correct and comprehensive than that of vivisection. You are at\r\n     liberty to make any use of this letter which you may think fit, but\r\n     if published I should wish the whole to appear. I have all my life\r\n     been a strong advocate for humanity to animals, and have done what\r\n     I could in my writings to enforce this duty. Several years ago,\r\n     when the agitation against physiologists commenced in England, it\r\n     was asserted that inhumanity was here practised, and useless\r\n     suffering caused to animals; and I was led to think that it might\r\n     be advisable to have an Act of Parliament on the subject. I then\r\n     took an active part in trying to get a Bill passed, such as would\r\n     have removed all just cause of complaint, and at the same time have\r\n     left physiologists free to pursue their researches--a Bill very\r\n     different from the Act which has since been passed. It is right to\r\n     add that the investigation of the matter by a Royal Commission\r\n     proved that the accusations made against our English physiologists\r\n     were false. From all that I have heard, however, I fear that in\r\n     some parts of Europe little regard is paid to the sufferings of\r\n     animals, and if this be the case I should be glad to hear of\r\n     legislation against inhumanity in any such country. On the other\r\n     hand, I know that physiology cannot possibly progress except by\r\n     means of experiments on living animals, and I feel the deepest\r\n     conviction that he who retards the progress of physiology commits a\r\n     crime against mankind. Any one who remembers, as I can, the state\r\n     of this science half a century ago, must admit that it has made\r\n     immense progress, and it is now progressing at an ever-increasing\r\n     rate.\r\n\r\n     \"What improvements in medical practice may be directly attributed\r\n     to physiological research is a question which can be properly\r\n     discussed only by those physiologists and medical practitioners who\r\n     have studied the history of their subjects; but, as far as I can\r\n     learn, the benefits are already great. However this may be, no one,\r\n     unless he is grossly ignorant of what science has done for mankind,\r\n     can entertain any doubt of the incalculable benefits which will\r\n     hereafter be derived from physiology, not only by man, but by the\r\n     lower animals. Look, for instance, at Pasteur's results of\r\n     modifying the germs of the most malignant diseases, from which, as\r\n     it so happens, animals will, in the first place, receive more\r\n     relief than man. Let it be remembered how many lives, and what a\r\n     fearful amount of suffering have been saved by the knowledge gained\r\n     of parasitic worms through the experiments of Virchow and others on\r\n     living animals. In the future every one will be astonished at the\r\n     ingratitude shown, at least in England, to these benefactors of\r\n     mankind. As for myself, permit me to assure you that I honour, and\r\n     shall always honour, every one who advances the noble science of\r\n     physiology.\r\n\r\n                               \"Dear sir, yours faithfully,\r\n                                              \"CHARLES DARWIN.\"\r\n\r\nAs an experimenter Darwin was by no means overconfident either in his\r\nmethods or his power of obtaining results. He simply took the best means\r\nopen to him, or that he could devise, applied them in the best way known\r\nto him, and calmly studied the result. \"As far as my experience goes,\"\r\nhe wrote, in reference to experimental work, \"what one expects rarely\r\nhappens.\" On another occasion, after working like a slave at a certain\r\ninvestigation, \"with very poor success;\" he remarks, \"as usual, almost\r\neverything goes differently to what I had anticipated.\" How few\r\ninvestigators have the magnanimity which appears in this confession. But\r\nmore than this, it is an indication of the rare patience with which he\r\nstuck at a subject till he knew all he could read or discover or develop\r\nin connection with it. It was \"dogged\" that did it; \"awfully hard work\"\r\nsometimes. In reference to an attempt of his to define intelligence,\r\nwhich he regarded as unsatisfactory, after remarking that he tried to\r\nobserve what passed in his own mind when he did the work of a worm, he\r\nwrites: \"If I come across a professed metaphysician, I will ask him to\r\ngive me a more technical definition with a few big words, about the\r\nabstract, the concrete, the absolute, and the infinite. But sincerely, I\r\nshould be grateful for any suggestions; for it will hardly do to assume\r\nthat every fool knows what 'intelligent' means.\"\r\n\r\nInasmuch as it must necessarily be of great interest to know\r\nthe attitude which so great a thinker as Darwin adopted towards\r\nChristianity, revelation, and other matters of theology, we give\r\nunabridged two letters which were written without a view to publication,\r\nand were published after his death without the authorisation of his\r\nrepresentatives. Having been widely published, however, it is right\r\nthat they should be given here.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was sent in 1873 to N. D. Deedes, a Dutch gentleman,\r\nwho wrote to ask Darwin his opinion on the existence of a God:\r\n\r\n     \"It is impossible to answer your question briefly; I am not sure\r\n     that I could do so even if I wrote at some length. But I may say\r\n     that the impossibility of conceiving that this grand and wondrous\r\n     universe, with our conscious selves, arose through chance, seems to\r\n     me our chief argument for the existence of God; but whether this is\r\n     an argument of real value, I have never been able to decide. I am\r\n     aware that if we admit a first cause, the mind still craves to know\r\n     whence it came and how it arose. Nor can I overlook the difficulty\r\n     from the immense amount of suffering through the world. I am, also,\r\n     induced to defer to a certain extent to the judgment of the many\r\n     able men who have fully believed in God; but here, again, I see how\r\n     poor an argument this is. The safest conclusion seems to be that\r\n     the whole subject is beyond the scope of man's intellect, but man\r\n     can do his duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe second letter was addressed to Nicholas, Baron Mengden, a German\r\nUniversity student, in whom the study of Darwin's books had raised\r\nreligious doubts. It is dated June 5, 1879. The following is a\r\nre-translation of a German translation:\r\n\r\n     \"I am very busy, and am an old man in delicate health, and have not\r\n     time to answer your questions fully, even assuming that they are\r\n     capable of being answered at all. Science and Christ have nothing\r\n     to do with each other, except in so far as the habit of scientific\r\n     investigation makes a man cautious about accepting any proofs. As\r\n     far as I am concerned, I do not believe that any revelation has\r\n     ever been made with regard to a future life; every one must draw\r\n     his own conclusions from vague and contradictory probabilities.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be added that he was greatly averse to every form of militant\r\nanti-religious controversy, and always deprecated it. He would have been\r\nthe last to desire that his words should be quoted as of scientific\r\nauthority, or as being more than the results of his own thought on\r\nquestions which were not the subject of his life study. Let those who\r\nthink that his having expressed these views is a regrettable blow to\r\northodox Christianity, set against it the enormous service Darwin did to\r\nreasonable natural theology by giving an intelligible key to the\r\nexplanation of the universe. And let all men remember that genuine\r\nhonesty such as Darwin's cannot possibly hinder the interests or the\r\nspread of truth. His declaration that \"man can do his duty,\" implies his\r\nconviction that man may know what his duty is; and very many noble\r\nspirits besides Darwin have not found it possible to advance with\r\ncertainty beyond this point.\r\n\r\nAs to Darwin's place in literature, that is due supereminently to his\r\nthoughts. In his expression of them he had the saving quality of\r\ndirectness, and usually wrote with simplicity. Incisive he was not\r\nordinarily; caution of his type harmonises ill with incisiveness. But\r\nwhat he lost thereby he gained in solidity and in permanence. Sometimes,\r\nas we have pointed out, his imagination carried him beyond his usual\r\nsober vein, and then he showed himself aglow with feeling or with\r\nsympathetic perception.\r\n\r\nBut when we speak of his imagination we pass at once to the other side\r\nof his mind--if indeed any such patient inquiry as his could have been\r\nmaintained except for the imaginative side of him. This lit up his path,\r\nbuoyed him in difficulties and failures, suggested new expedients,\r\nexperiments, and combinations. The use of imagination in science has\r\nnever been more aptly illustrated nor more beneficial than in his case.\r\nDarwin, more than any other man perhaps, showed the value, if not the\r\nessentiality, of \"working hypotheses\"; and if any man now wants to\r\nprogress in biology, he will be foolish if he does not seek such and use\r\nthem freely, and abandon them readily if disproved.\r\n\r\nDarwin imagined grandly, and verified his imaginings as far as one man's\r\nlife suffices; and no man can do more. And Darwin won, as far as a man\r\ncan win, success during his lifetime. As Professor Huxley said, in\r\nlecturing on \"The Coming of Age of 'The Origin of Species,'\" \"the\r\nforemost men of science in every country are either avowed champions of\r\nits leading doctrines, or at any rate abstain from opposing them.\" His\r\nprescience has in less than a generation been justified by the discovery\r\nof intermediate fossil forms of animals too numerous to be here\r\nrecounted. The break between vertebrate and invertebrate animals,\r\nbetween flowering and non-flowering plants, between animal and plant, is\r\nnow bridged over by discoveries in the life histories of animals and\r\nplants which exist to-day. Embryo animals and plants are now known to go\r\nthrough stages which repeat and condense the upward ascent of life; and\r\nthey give us information of the greatest value as to lost stages in the\r\npath. We can, as it were, see the actual track through which evolution\r\nmay have proceeded. \"Thus,\" says Professor Huxley, \"if the doctrine of\r\nevolution had not existed, palæontologists must have invented it, so\r\nirresistibly is it forced upon the mind by the study of the remains of\r\nthe Tertiary mammalia which have been brought to light since 1859;\" and\r\nagain, \"so far as the animal world is concerned, evolution is no longer\r\na speculation, but a statement of historical fact.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the limits of the truth of Darwin's theory, Professor Huxley,\r\nwriting on \"Evolution in Biology,\" in \"The Encyclopædia Britannica,\"\r\nsays: \"How far natural selection suffices for the production of species\r\nremains to be seen. Few can doubt that, if not the whole cause, it is a\r\nvery important factor in that operation; and that it must play a great\r\npart in the sorting out of varieties into those which are transitory,\r\nand those which are permanent. But the causes and conditions of\r\nvariation have yet to be thoroughly explored; and the importance of\r\nnatural selection will not be impaired, even if further inquiries should\r\nprove that variability is definite, and is determined in certain\r\ndirections rather than in others, by conditions inherent in that which\r\nvaries.\"\r\n\r\nWe have not space to describe the importance of the work Darwin did in,\r\nor bearing on, entomology, changing its face and vastly elevating its\r\nimportance. A volume might be compiled from his writings on this\r\nsubject, as reference to Professor Riley's excellent summary (Darwin\r\nMemorial Meeting, Washington, 1882) will readily show. Nor can we\r\nrecount his important work in other branches of biology further than has\r\nbeen already done in the foregoing pages. To do so would require much\r\nmore than a volume of this size.\r\n\r\nOne special department may perhaps claim notice on the ground of its\r\nsupposed non-scientific character. Dr. Masters (_Gardeners' Chronicle_,\r\nApril 22, 1882) says of Darwin's service to horticulture: \"Let any one\r\nwho knows what was the state of botany in this country even so recently\r\nas fifteen or twenty years ago, compare the feeling between botanists\r\nand horticulturists at that time with what it is now. What sympathy had\r\nthe one for the pursuits of the other? The botanist looked down on the\r\nvarieties, the races, and strains, raised with so much pride by the\r\npatient skill of the florist as on things unworthy of his notice and\r\nstudy. The horticulturist, on his side, knowing how very imperfectly\r\nplants could be studied from the mummified specimens in herbaria, which\r\nthen constituted in most cases all the material that the botanist of\r\nthis country considered necessary for the study of plants, naturally\r\nlooked on the botanist somewhat in the light of a laborious trifler....\r\nDarwin altered all this. He made the dry bones live; he invested plants\r\nand animals with a history, a biography, a genealogy, which at once\r\nconferred an interest and a dignity on them. Before, they were as the\r\nstuffed skin of a beast in the glass case of a museum; now they are\r\nliving beings, each in their degree affected by the same circumstances\r\nthat affect ourselves, and swayed, _mutatis mutandis_, by like feelings\r\nand like passions. If he had done nothing more than this we might still\r\nhave claimed Darwin as a horticulturist; but as we shall see, he has\r\nmore direct claims on our gratitude. The apparently trifling variations,\r\nthe variations which it was once the fashion for botanists to overlook,\r\nhave become, as it were, the keystone of a great theory.\"\r\n\r\nA valuable summary of Darwin's influence on general philosophic thought\r\nhas been given by Mr. James Sully, in his article, \"Evolution in\r\nPhilosophy,\" in \"The Encyclopædia Britannica,\" 9th ed., vol. viii. He,\r\nlike many other thinkers, considers that Darwin has done much to banish\r\nold ideas as to the evidence of purpose in nature. Mr. Sully's views are\r\nnot entirely shared, however, by Professor Winchell, an able American\r\nevolutionist (\"Encyclopædia Americana,\" vol. ii.) who considers that the\r\nquestion of teleology, or of purpose in nature, is not really touched by\r\nthe special principle of natural selection, nor by the general doctrine\r\nof evolution. The mechanical theorist may, consistently with these\r\ndoctrines, maintain that every event takes place without a purpose;\r\nwhile the teleologist, or believer in purpose, may no less consistently\r\nmaintain that the more orderly and uniform we find the succession\r\nof events, the more reason is there to presume that a purposeful\r\nintelligence is regulating them. It is certainly impossible to show that\r\nthe whole system of evolution does not exist for a purpose. The ranks of\r\nthe evolutionists, and even of the Darwinians, as a fact, embrace\r\nbelievers in the most diverse systems of philosophy, including many\r\nof those who accept Christ's teaching as an authoritative Divine\r\nrevelation. May not this diversity among Darwinians itself teach hope?\r\nDarwinism is held with vital grip and will therefore not become a dead\r\ncreed, a fossil formula. The belief that every generation is a step in\r\nprogress to a higher and fuller life contains within it the promise of\r\na glorious evolution which is no longer a faint hope, but a reasoned\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n   \"Man's thought is like Antæus, and must be\r\n        Touched to the ground of Nature to regain\r\n        Fresh force, new impulse, else it would remain\r\n    Dead in the grip of strong Authority.\r\n    But, once thereon reset, 'tis like a tree,\r\n        Sap-swollen in spring-time: bonds may not restrain;\r\n        Nor weight repress; its rootlets rend in twain\r\n    Dead stones and walls and rocks resistlessly.\r\n\r\n    Thine then it was to touch dead thoughts to earth,\r\n      Till of old dreams sprang new philosophies,\r\n        From visions systems, and beneath thy spell\r\n      Swiftly uprose, like magic palaces,--\r\n    Thyself half-conscious only of thy worth--\r\n        Calm priest of a tremendous oracle.\"[13]\r\n\r\nHere let us leave Charles Darwin; a marvellously patient and successful\r\nrevolutioniser of thought; a noble and beloved man.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13: Round Table Series. \"Charles Darwin\" (1886), by J.

The heroes and heroines of these admirable stories\r\nbelong to every rank of life, from the king and noble to the humble\r\npeasant.\r\n\r\n\"THE TALES OF THE BORDERS\" have always been immensely popular with the\r\nyoung, and whether we view them in their moral aspect, or as vehicles\r\nfor instruction and amusement, the collected series forms a repertory of\r\nhealthy and interesting literature unrivalled in the language.\r\n\r\n  The _Scotsman_ says:--\"Those who have read the tales in the unwieldy\r\n  tomes in which they are to be found in the libraries will welcome the\r\n  publication of this neat, handy, and well-printed edition.\"\r\n\r\n  The _Dundee Advertiser_ says:--\"Considering how attractive are these\r\n  tales, whether regarded as illustrating Scottish life, or as\r\n  entertaining items of romance, there can be no doubt of their\r\n  continued popularity. We last read them in volumes the size of a\r\n  family Bible, and we are glad to have an opportunity to renew our\r\n  acquaintance with them in a form so much more handy and elegant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n             EACH VOLUME WILL BE COMPLETE IN ITSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\n      London: WALTER SCOTT, 24 Warwick Lane, Paternoster Row.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Windsor Series of Poetical Anthologies.\r\n\r\n_Printed on Antique Paper.
