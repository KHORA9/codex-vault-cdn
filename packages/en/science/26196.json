Shelley says of him:\r\n\r\n      \"'Mid others of less note came one frail form,\r\n        A phantom among men; companionless\r\n      As the last cloud of an expiring storm,\r\n        Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,\r\n        Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,\r\n      Aclaeon-like, and now he fled astray,\r\n        With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness,\r\n      And his own thoughts along that rugged way\r\n    Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their prey.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Southey, Scott, Kirke White,\r\nLandor, Montgomery, and others, have laid immortal flowers upon his\r\ntomb, to make the heart ache that we did not live in time to save the\r\n\"sleepless soul\" from \"perishing in his pride.\"\r\n\r\nOf the genius of poor Chatterton, Campbell says, \"I would rather lean to\r\nthe utmost enthusiasm of his admirers, than to the cold opinion of those\r\nwho are afraid of being blinded to the defects of the poems attributed\r\nto Rowley, by the veil of obsolete phraseology which is thrown over\r\nthem. If we look to the ballad of Sir Charles Bawdin, and translate it\r\ninto modern English, we shall find its strength and interest to have no\r\ndependence on obsolete words. The inequality of his various productions\r\nmay be compared to the disproportions of the ungrown giant. His works\r\nhad nothing of the definite neatness of that precocious talent which\r\nstops short in early maturity. His thirst for knowledge was that of a\r\nbeing taught by instinct to lay up materials for the exercise of great\r\nand undeveloped powers. Even in his favorite maxim, that a man by\r\nabstinence and perseverance might accomplish whatever he pleased, may be\r\ntraced the indications of a genius which nature had meant to achieve\r\nimmortality. Tasso alone can be compared to him as a juvenile prodigy.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. S. C. HALL gives us, in her \"Pilgrimages to English Shrines,\" in\r\nthe _Art Journal_, the following interesting sketches of scenes\r\nconnected with his history:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CHATTERTON.\r\n\r\nCHATTERTON--poor Chatterton! We had been brooding sadly over his\r\nfragment of a life, ending at seventeen--when ordinary lives begin--and\r\nturning page after page of Horace Walpole's literary fooleries, to find\r\nhis explanations and apologies for want of feeling and sympathy, which\r\nhis flippant style, and heartless commentaries, illustrate to\r\nperfection; and we closed, with an aching heart, the volumes of both the\r\nparasite of genius, and him who was its mightiest creation and most\r\nmiserable victim:--\r\n\r\n    \"The marvellous boy who perished in his pride.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only natural for us to recall the many instances we have\r\nourselves known, during the past twenty years, or more, of sorrow and\r\ndistress among those who sought distinction in the thorny labyrinths of\r\nliterature;--those who\r\n\r\n    ----\"waged with Fortune an eternal war,\r\n    Checked by the scoff of Pride, by Envy's frown,\r\n    And Poverty's unconquerable bar;\"\r\n\r\nand those who, after a brief struggle with untoward fate, left the\r\nbattle-field, to die, \"unpitied and unknown!\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen the career of a young literary man commenced with the first\r\ngrand requisite of all excellence worth achieving--ENTHUSIASM; high\r\nnotions of moral honor, and a warm devotedness to that \"calling\" which\r\nlifts units to a pinnacle formed by the dry bones of hundreds slain. We\r\nhave seen that enthusiasm frozen by disappointment--that honor corrupted\r\nby the contamination of dissipated men--that devotedness to THE CAUSE\r\nfade away before the great want of nature--want of bread--which it had\r\nfailed to bestow. We have seen, ay, in one little year, the flashing eye\r\ndimmed--the round cheek flattened--the bright, hopeful creature, who\r\nwent forth into the world--rejoicing like the sun to run his\r\ncourse--dragged from the waters of our leaden Thames, a discolored\r\nremnant of mortality--recognized only by the mother who looked to him\r\nfor all the world could give!\r\n\r\nThis is horrible--but it is a tragedy soon played out. There are\r\nhundreds at this moment possessed of the _consciousness_ of power\r\nwithout the _strength_ to use it. To such, a little help might lead to a\r\nlife of successful toil--perhaps the happiest life a man can lead. A\r\nheritage of usefulness is one of peace to the last. We knew another\r\nyouth, of a more patient nature than he of whom we have just spoken. He\r\nseemed never weary. We have witnessed his nightly toil; his daily labor;\r\nthe smiling patience with which he endured the sneers levelled, _only_\r\nin English society, against \"_mere_ literary men.\" We remember when, on\r\nthe first day of every month, he used to haunt the booksellers' shops to\r\nlook over the magazines, cast his eyes down the table of contents, just\r\nto see if \"his poem\" or \"his paper\" had been inserted--then lay them\r\ndown one after another with a pale sickly smile, expressive of\r\ndisappointment, and turn away with a look of gentle endurance. The\r\ninsertion of a sonnet, for which perhaps he might receive seven\r\nshillings, would set him dreaming again of literary immortality; and at\r\nlast the dream was realized by an accident, or rather, to speak\r\nadvisedly, by a good Providence. He became known--known at once--blazed\r\nforth; something he had written attracted the town's attention, and\r\nladies in crowded drawing-rooms stood upon chairs to see that poor,\r\nworn, pale man of letters: and magazines, and grave reviews, and\r\ngayly-bound albums, all waited for his contributions--charge what he\r\npleased; and flushed with fame, and weighed down with money--money paid\r\nfor the very articles that had been rejected without one civil line of\r\ncourtesy--the great sustaining hope of his life was realized; he married\r\none as worn and pale with the world's toil, as himself--married--and\r\ndied within a month! The tide was too tardy in turning!\r\n\r\nWho shall say how many men of genius have walked, like unhappy\r\nChatterton, through the valley of the shadow of death, and found no\r\nguide, no consolation--no hope; if, the one GREAT HOPE had not been most\r\nmercifully planted early in their hearts and minds?\r\n\r\nIt was with melancholy pleasure that, during the past summer, our\r\nPilgrimage was made to the places connected with the boy's memory, in\r\nBristol; first to Colston's school, in which he was educated;[1] next to\r\nthe dull district in which he was either born or passed his boyhood;\r\nthen to the Institution, where his \"Will,\" a mad document, and other\r\nmemoranda connected with his memory, are preserved with a degree of\r\ncare, that seems--or is--a mockery, when contrasted with the worse than\r\nindifference of the city to all that concerned him when alive; next to\r\nthe house of Master Canynge, and next to the monument (Redcliffe Church)\r\nwith which his name will be associated as long as one of its stones\r\nremains upon another; chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancies\r\nthrough its long-drawn aisles; pondering sadly in the muniment-room,\r\nwhere the cofres that suggested the forgeries, still lie rotting; and\r\ngazing with mingled sorrow and surprise on the \"Cenotaph to Chatterton,\"\r\nwhich now, taken to pieces, occupies the corner of a damp vault--\r\n\r\n    \"A solemn cenotaph to thee,\r\n    Sweet Harper of time-shrouded minstrelsy!\"\r\n\r\nAh! such books as we have been reading, and such memories as we have\r\nbeen recalling, are, after all, unprofitable--a darkness without light.\r\nWe closed our eyes upon the world, which, in our momentary bitterness,\r\nwe likened to one great charnel-house, entombing all things glorious and\r\nbright. We walked to the window; the rain was descending in\r\ntorrents--pour, pour; pattens clattered in the areas, and a solitary\r\npostman made the street echo with his impatient knocks. A poor\r\norgan-boy, whom we have long known, was moving, rather than walking, in\r\nthe centre; his hat flapped over his eyes by the rain, yet still he\r\nturned the handle, and the damp music crawled forth: he paused opposite\r\nour door, turned up the leaf of his hat, and looked upward; we missed\r\nthe family of white mice which usually crawled on the top of his organ:\r\npoor child, he had sheltered them in his bosom; it was nothing more than\r\nnatural that he should do so, and the act was commonplace enough--but it\r\npleased us--it diminished our gloom. And we thought, if the great ones\r\nof the land would but foster the talent that needs, and deserves,\r\nprotection from the storms of life, as that lonely boy sheltered the\r\ncreatures intrusted to his care, the world would be all the better. We\r\ndo not mean to insult the memory of such a genius as Chatterton by\r\nsaying that he required a PATRON--the very sound is linked with a\r\nservility that degrades a noble nature; but we do say he sadly wanted a\r\nFRIEND--some one who could have understood and appreciated his wonderful\r\nintellectual gifts; and whose strength of mind and position in society\r\nwould have given power to direct and control the overleaping and\r\nindomitable pride which ultimately destroyed \"the Boy.\" His career\r\nteaches a lesson of such rare value to all who seek distinction in any\r\nsphere of life, that we would have it considered well--as a beacon to\r\nwarn from ruin.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh! what a tangled web we weave,\r\n    When first we practise to deceive!\"\r\n\r\nDespite his marvellous talents, his industry, his knowledge, his\r\nmagnitude of mind, his glorious imagination, his bold satire, his\r\nindependence, his devotional love of his mother and sister--if he had\r\nlived through a long age of prosperity, Chatterton could never have been\r\ntrusted, nor esteemed, _from his total want of truth_. His is the most\r\nstriking example upon record of the necessity for uprightness in word\r\nand deed. Where a great end is to be achieved--there must be\r\nconsistency, a union between noble daring and noble deeds--there must be\r\nTruth! No man has ever deviated from it without losing not only the\r\nrespect of the thinking, but even the confidence of the unwise.\r\nChatterton's earliest idea seems to have been how to deceive; and, were\r\nit possible to laugh at youthful fraud, there would be something\r\nirresistibly ludicrous in the lad bewildering the old pewterer, Burgum.\r\nImagine the fair-haired rosy boy, the brightness of his extraordinary\r\neyes increased by the covert mischief which urged him forward--fancy his\r\npresenting himself to Master Burgum, who, dull as his own pewter, had\r\nthe ambition, which the cunning youth fostered, of being thought of an\r\n\"ancient family\"--fancy Chatterton in his poor-school dress presenting\r\nhimself to this man, whose business, Chatterton's biographer, Mr. Dix,\r\ntells us, was carried on in the house now occupied by Messrs. Sander,\r\nBristol Bridge,[2] and informing him that he had made a\r\ndiscovery--presenting to him various documents, with a parchment\r\npainting of the De Burgham arms, in proof of his royal descent from the\r\nConqueror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRISTOL BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dix assures us, \"that never once doubting the validity of the\r\nrecord, in which his own honors were so deeply implicated, he presented\r\nthe poor bluecoat-boy, who had been so fortunate in _finding_ so much,\r\nand so assiduous in his endeavors to collect the remainder, with _five\r\nshillings_!\" Blush, Bristol, blush at this record of a citizen's\r\nmeanness; the paltry remuneration could have hardly tempted even so poor\r\na lad as Thomas Chatterton to continue his labors for the love of gain;\r\nyet he furnished Burgum with further information, loving the indulgence\r\nof his mystifying powers, and secretly satirizing the folly he duped.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to trace back any circumstance which could, to\r\nspeak advisedly, have led to such a course of deception as was practised\r\nby this boy; born of obscure parents, his father, a man of dissolute\r\nhabits, was sub-chanter of the Cathedral, and also master of the free\r\nschool in Pyle-street; this clever, but harsh, and dissolute man died in\r\nAugust, 1752, and the poet was born on the 20th of the following\r\nNovember.[3] Such a parent could not be a loss; he would have been, in\r\nall human probability, as careless of his son as he was of his wife;\r\nand, at all events, Chatterton had not the misery of early cruelty to\r\ncomplain of, for he had a mother, tender and affectionate, although\r\ntotally unfit to guide and manage his wayward nature. Her first grief\r\nwith him arose, strange as it may seem, from his inaptitude for\r\nlearning--as a child he disdained A B C, and indulged himself with his\r\nown thoughts. When nearly seven years old he \"fell in love,\" to use his\r\nmother's phrase, \"with an illuminated French manuscript,\" and thus\r\nlearned his letters from the very sort of thing he spent his early days\r\nin counterfeiting. His progress was wonderful, both as to rapidity and\r\nextent, and his pride kept pace therewith. A friend, wishing to give the\r\nboy and his sister a present of china-ware, asked him what device he\r\nwould choose to ornament his with. \"Paint me,\" he said, \"an angel with\r\nwings and a trumpet, to trumpet my name over the world.\" Here was a\r\nproof of innate ambition; if his mother had had an understanding mind,\r\nthis observation would have taught her to read his character. Such\r\nambition could have been directed,--and directed to noble deeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF CHATTERTON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHATTERTON AS DOORKEEPER.]\r\n\r\nHe was admitted into the Blue Coat School, commonly called \"Colston's\r\nSchool,\"[4] before he was eight years old, and his enthusiastic joy at\r\nthe prospect of learning so much, was damped by finding that, to quench\r\nhis thirst for knowledge, \"there were not books enough.\" When he took in\r\nrotation the post of doorkeeper at the school, he used to indulge\r\nhimself in making verses,[5] and his sister, who loved him tenderly,\r\npresented him with a pocket-book, in which he wrote verses, and gave it\r\nback to her the following year. There was nothing in this species of\r\ntuition or companionship to create or foster either the imitations or\r\nthe satire he indulged in, he had neither correction nor assistance from\r\nany one. Even before his apprenticeship to Mr. John Lambert, he felt he\r\nwas not appreciated or understood; perhaps no one ever _acted_ a greater\r\nsatire upon his own profession than this harsh attorney, who deemed his\r\napprentice on a level with his footboy. He must have been a man utterly\r\ndevoid of perception and feeling; his insulting contempt of what he\r\ncould not understand added considerably to the sarcastic bitterness of\r\nChatterton's nature, and it is easy to picture the boy's feelings when\r\nhis productions were torn by this tyrant and scattered on the office\r\nfloor! He has his reward. John Lambert, the scrivener, is only\r\nremembered as the insulter of Thomas Chatterton![6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF CANYNGE.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to pause at every page of this boy's brief but\r\neventful life, and lament that he had no friend; reading, as we do, by\r\nthe light of other days, we can see so many passages where judicious\r\ncounsel, given with the intelligent affection that would at once have\r\nopened his heart, _must_ have saved him; his heart, once laid bare to\r\nfriendship, would have been purified by the air of truth; it was its\r\n_closeness_ which infected his nature. And yet the scrivener considered\r\nhim a good apprentice. His industry was amazing; his frequent employment\r\nwas to copy precedents, and one volume, in his handwriting, which is\r\nstill extant, consists of three hundred and forty-four closely-written\r\nfolio pages. There was in that gloomy office an edition of Camden's\r\n\"Britannia,\" and, having borrowed from Mr. Green, a bookseller,\r\nSpeight's \"Chaucer,\" he compiled therefrom an ingenious glossary, for\r\nhis own use, in two parts. \"The first,\" Mr. Dix says, \"contained old\r\nwords, with the modern English--the second, the modern English, with the\r\nold words; this enabled him to turn modern English into old, as an\r\nEnglish and Latin dictionary enables the student to turn English into\r\nLatin.\" How miserable it is, amongst these evidences of his industry and\r\ngenius, to find that all his ingenuity turned to the furtherance of a\r\nfraud. He seems to have been morally dead to every thing like the\r\ndisgrace attending falsehood; for, when struggling afterwards in London\r\nto appear prosperous while starving, he wrote home to Mr. Catcott, and\r\nconcludes his letter by stating that he intended going abroad as a\r\n_surgeon_, adding, \"Mr. Barrett has it in his power to assist me\r\ngreatly, by _his giving me a physical character_; I hope he will.\" He\r\nseems to have had no idea that he was asking Mr. Barrett to do a\r\ndishonest action.\r\n\r\nBut the grand fraud of his short life was boldly dared by this boy in\r\nhis sixteenth year. Why he should have ever descended to forge when he\r\nfelt the high pressure of genius so strong within him, is inexplicable.\r\nWhy, with his daring pride, he should have submitted to be considered a\r\ntranscriber, where he originated, is more than marvellous. The spell of\r\na benighting antiquity seemed around him; it might lead one to a belief\r\nin \"Gramarie\"--that some fake spirit had issued forth from the \"cofre of\r\nMr. Canynge,\"[7] so long preserved in the room over the north porch of\r\nthis Bristol church of Redcliffe--a \"_cofre_\" secured by six keys, all\r\nof which being lost or mislaid, the vestry ordered the \"_cofre_\" to be\r\nopened; and not only \"Canynge's _cofre_,\" but all the \"_cofres_,\" in the\r\nmysterious chamber: not from any love of antiquity, but because of the\r\nhope of obtaining certain title-deeds supposed to be contained therein.\r\nWell, these intelligent worthies, having found what concerned\r\nthemselves, took them away, leaving behind, _and open_, parchments and\r\ndocuments which might have enriched our antiquarian literature beyond\r\nall calculation.[8] Chatterton's father used to carry these parchments\r\naway wholesale, and covered with the precious relics, bibles, and\r\nschool-books: most likely other officers of the church did the same.\r\nAfter his death, his widow conveyed many of them, with her children and\r\nfurniture, to her new residence, and, woman-like, formed them into dolls\r\nand thread-papers. In process of time, the child's attention being\r\naroused by the illuminated manuscripts, he conveyed every bit of\r\nparchment he could find to a small den of a room in his mother's house,\r\nwhich he called his own: and, when he grew a little older, set forth,\r\nwith considerable tact, in answer to all questions asked of him as to\r\nhow he obtained the poems and information, that he himself had searched\r\nthe old \"_cofres_,\"[9] and discovered the poems of the Monk Rowley.\r\nCertainly he could not have had a better person to trumpet his discovery\r\nthan \"a talkative fool\" like Burgum, who was so proud of his pedigree as\r\nto torment the officers of the Herald's College about his ancestors; and\r\nhe was not the only one imposed on by Chatterton's talent. His\r\nsimple-minded mother bore testimony to his joy at discovering those\r\n\"written parchments upon the covered books:\" and, of course, each\r\ndiscovery added to his antiquarian knowledge; for, though no trace\r\nexists of the Monk Rowley's originals, there is little doubt that on\r\nsome of those parchments he found enough to set him thinking, and with\r\nhim to think and act was the same thing; indeed, there is one passage in\r\nhis poems bearing so fully upon the fraud, that we transcribe it. He is\r\nwriting of having discharged all his obligations to Mr. Catcott:--\r\n\r\n    \"If ever obligated to thy purse,\r\n    _Rowley discharges all, my first chief curse!_\r\n    For had I never known the antique lore,\r\n    I ne'er had ventured from my peaceful shore,\r\n    But, happy in my humble sphere, had moved\r\n    Untroubled, unsuspected, unbeloved.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUNIMENT ROOM.]\r\n\r\nA Mr. Rudhall[11] said that, when Chatterton wrote on a parchment, he\r\nheld it over a candle to give it the appearance of antiquity; and a Mr.\r\nGardener has recorded, that he once saw Chatterton rub a parchment over\r\nwith ochre, and afterwards rub it on the ground, saying, \"that was the\r\nway to antiquate it.\" This _expose_ of Chatterton's craft is so at\r\nvariance with his usual caution that we can hardly credit it. A humble\r\nwoman, Mrs. Edkins, speaks of his spending all his holidays in the\r\nlittle den of a room we have mentioned, where he _locked_ himself in,\r\nand would remain the entire day without meals, returning with his hands\r\nand face completely begrimed with dirt and charcoal; and she well\r\nremembers his having a charcoal pounce-bag and parchment and letters on\r\na little deal table, and all over the ground was a litter of parchments;\r\nand she and his mother at one time fancied he intended to discolor\r\nhimself and run away to the gipsies; but afterwards Mrs. Edkins believed\r\nthat he was laboring at the Rowley manuscripts, and she thought he got\r\nhimself bound to a lawyer that he might get at old law books. The\r\ntestimony she bears to his affectionate tenderness towards his mother\r\nand sister is touching: while his pride led him to seek for notoriety\r\nfor himself, it was only to render his mother and sister comfortable\r\nthat he coveted wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is not our province to enter into the controversy as to whether the\r\nMSS. were originals or forgeries: it would seem to be as undecided\r\nto-day as it was three quarters of a century ago; the boy \"died and made\r\nno sign:\" and the world has not been put in possession of any additional\r\nfacts by which the question might be determined: the balance of proof\r\nappears in favor of those who contend they were the sole offspring of\r\nhis mind, suggested merely by ancient documents from which he could have\r\nborrowed no idea except that of rude spelling; yet it is by no means\r\nimpossible that poems did actually exist, and came into his hands, which\r\nhe altered and interpolated, but which he did not create.\r\n\r\nIn aid of his plans, Chatterton first addressed himself to Dodsley, the\r\nPall Mall bookseller, once with smaller poems, and afterwards on behalf\r\nof the greatest production of his genius--the tragedy of \"Ella;\" but the\r\nbooksellers of those days were not more intellectual than those at the\r\npresent: they devoured the small forgery of the great Horace Walpole,\r\n\"The Castle of Otranto,\" and rejected the magnificence of a nameless\r\ncomposition. This man's neglect drove the young poet to the \"Autocrat of\r\nStrawberry Hill.\" In reply he at first received a polished letter. The\r\nliterary trifler was not aware of the poverty and low station of his\r\ncorrespondent, and so was courteous; he is \"grateful\" and \"singularly\r\nobliged;\" bowing, and perfumed, and polite. Other communications\r\nfollowed. Walpole inquired--discovered the poet's situation; and _then_\r\nhe changed! The poor fond boy! how hard and bitter was the rebuff. How\r\nlittle had he imagined that _the_ Walpole's soul was not, _by five\r\nshillings_, as large as the Bristol pewterer's!--that he who was an\r\nadept at literary imposition could have been so harsh to a\r\nfellow-sinner! The volume of his works containing \"Miscellanies of\r\nChatterton\" is now before us. Hear to his indignant honesty! He declares\r\nthat \"all the house of forgery are relations; and that though it be but\r\njust to Chatterton's memory to say his poverty never made him claim\r\nkindred with the richest, or more enriching branches, yet that his\r\ningenuity in counterfeiting styles, and I believe hands, might easily\r\nhave led him to those more facile imitations of prose--promissory\r\nnotes.\" The literal meaning of this paragraph stamps the littleness of\r\nthe man's mind. A slight--a very slight effort on his part might have\r\nturned the current of the boy's thoughts, and saved him from misery and\r\ndeath. We do not call Chatterton \"his victim,\" because we do not think\r\nhim so; but he, or any one in his position, might have turned him from\r\nthe love of an unworthy notoriety to the pursuit of a laudable ambition.\r\nFollowing in the world's track (which he was ever careful not to\r\noutstep), when the boy was dead, Walpole bore eloquent testimony to his\r\ngenius. The words of praise he gives his memory are like golden grains\r\namid the chaffy _verbiage_ with which he defends himself. If he\r\nperceived this at first, why not have come forward hand and heart, and\r\nshouted him on to honest fortune? But, like all _clique kings_, he made\r\nno general cause with literature; he only smiled on his individual\r\nworshippers, who could applaud when he said, with cruel playfulness,\r\n\"that singing birds should not be too well fed!\"\r\n\r\nHis master, Lambert, dismissed the youth from his service, because he\r\nhad reason to suppose he meditated self-destruction; and then he\r\nproceeded to London. How buoyant and full of hope he was during his\r\nprobationary days there, his letters to his mother and sister testify;\r\nhis gifts, also, extracted from his necessities, are evidences of the\r\nbent of his mind--fans and china--luxuries rather than necessaries; but\r\nin this, it must be remembered, his judgment was in fault, not his\r\naffections. In all things he was swayed and guided by his pride,--his\r\nindomitable pride. The period, brief as it was, of his sojourn in the\r\ngreat metropolis proved that Walpole, while he neglected him so cruelly,\r\nunderstood him perfectly, when he said that \"nothing in Chatterton could\r\nbe separated from Chatterton--that all he did was the effervescence of\r\nungovernable impulse, which, chameleon-like, imbibed the colours of all\r\nit looked on it was Ossian, or a Saxon monk, or Gray, or Smollett, or\r\nJunius.\" His first letter to his mother is dated, April the 26th, 1770.\r\nHe terminated his own existence on the 24th of August in the same year.\r\nHe battled with the crowded world of London, and, what was in his case a\r\nmore dire enemy than the world, his overwhelming pride, for nearly four\r\nmonths. Alas! how terrible are the reflections which these few weeks\r\nsuggest! Now borne aloft upon the billows of hope, sparkling in the\r\nfitful brightness of a feverish sun, and then plunged into the slough of\r\ndespair, his proud, dark soul disclaiming all human participation in a\r\nmisery exaggerated by his own unbending pride. Let us not talk of\r\ndenying sympathy to persons who create their own miseries; they endure\r\nagonies thrice told. The paltry remuneration he received for his\r\nproductions is recorded by himself. Among the items is one as\r\nextraordinary as the indignant emotion it excites:--\r\n\r\n    Received from Mr. Hamilton, for 16 songs,            10s. 6d.\r\n    Of Mr. Hamilton, for \"Candidus\" and Foreign Journal   2s.!!\r\n\r\nWe are wearied for him of the world's dark sight: yet in the same book\r\nis recorded that the same publisher owed him L10 19s. 6d.! This sum\r\nmight have saved him, but he was too proud to ask for money; too proud\r\nto complain; too proud to accept the invitation of his acquaintances, or\r\nhis landlady, to dine or sup with them; and all too proud to hint, even\r\nto his mother and sister, that he was any thing but prosperous. Ardent\r\nas if he had been a son of the hot south, he had learned nothing of\r\npatience or expediency. His first residence was at Mrs. Walmsley's, in\r\nShoreditch, but, doubtless, finding the lodging too expensive, he\r\nremoved to a Mr. Angell's, sac (or dress) maker, 4, Brook Street,\r\nHolborn. This woman, who seems to have been of a gentle nature, finding\r\nthat for two days he had confined himself to his room, and gone without\r\nsustenance, invited him to dine with her; but he was offended, and\r\nassured her he was not hungry. It is quite impossible to account for\r\nthis uncalled for pride. It was his nature. Lord Byron said he was mad:\r\naccording to _his_ view of the case, all eccentricity is madness; but in\r\nthe case of unhappy Chatterton, that madness which arises from \"hope\r\ndeferred,\" was unquestionably endured. Three days before his death,\r\npursuing, with a friend, the melancholy and speculative employment of\r\nreading epitaphs in the churchyard of St. Pancras, absorbed by his own\r\nreflections, he fell into a new-made grave. There was something akin to\r\nthe raven's croak, the death-fetch, the fading spectre, in this\r\nforeboding accident: he smiled at it, and told his friend he felt the\r\nsting of speedy dissolution:--\r\n\r\n                  \"Then black despair,\r\n    The shadow of a starless night, was thrown\r\n    Over the earth on which he moved alone.\"\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen years and nine months, his career ended; it was\r\nshown that he had swallowed arsenic in water, and so--\r\n\r\n    \"perished in his pride!\"\r\n\r\nAn inquest was held, and yet though Englishmen--men who could read and\r\nwrite, and hear--who must have heard of the boy's talents, either as a\r\npoet, a satirist, or a political writer--though these men were guided by\r\na coroner, one, of course, in a more elevated sphere than those who\r\nusually determine the intentions of the departed soul--yet was there not\r\none--NOT ONE of them all--with sufficient veneration for the casket\r\nwhich had contained the diamond--not one with enough of sympathy for the\r\nwidow's son--to wrap his body in a decent shroud, and kneel in Christian\r\npiety by his grave!--not one to pause and think that, between genius and\r\nmadness,\r\n\r\n    \"What thin partitions do their bounds divide!\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Southey to Mr. Britton (dated in 1810, to which we have\r\nalready referred, and which Mr. Britton kindly submitted to us with\r\nvarious other correspondence on the subject), he says, \"there can now be\r\nno impropriety in mentioning what could not be said when the collected\r\nedition of Chatterton's works was published,--that there was a taint of\r\ninsanity in his family. His sister was once confined; and this is a key\r\nto the eccentricities of his life, and the deplorable rashness of his\r\ndeath.\" Of this unhappy predisposition, indeed, he seems to have been\r\nhimself conscious, for \"in his last will and testament,\" written in\r\nApril, 1770, before he quitted Bristol, when he seems to have meditated\r\nsuicide--although, from the mock-heroic style of the document his\r\nserious design may be questioned,--he writes, \"If I do a mad action, it\r\nis conformable to every action of my life, which all savored of\r\ninsanity.\" His \"sudden fits of weeping, for which no reason could be\r\nassigned,\" when a mere child, were but the preludes to those gloomy\r\nforebodings which haunted him when a boy. His mother had said, \"she was\r\noften apprehensive of his going mad.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so,--the verdict having been pronounced, he was cast into\r\nthe burying-ground of Shoe Lane work-house--the paupers'\r\nburying-ground,--the end, as far as his clayey tabernacle was concerned,\r\nof all his dreamy greatness. When the ear was deaf to the worship of the\r\ncharmer, he received his meed of posthumous praise. Malone, Croft, Dr.\r\nKnox, Wharton, Sherwin, Pye, Mrs. Cowley, Walter Scott, Haley,\r\nColeridge, Dermody, Wordsworth, Shelley, William Howitt, Keats, who\r\ndedicated his \"Endymion\" to the memory of his fellow-genius; the burly\r\nJohnson, whose praise seemed unintentional; the gentle and most\r\nChristian poet, James Montgomery,--have each and all offered tributes to\r\nhis memory. Robert Southey, whose polished, strong and long unclouded\r\nmind was a treasure-house of noble-thoughts, assisted Mr. Cottle in\r\nproviding for the poet's family by a collection of his works; and,\r\nthough last, not least, excellent John Britton has labored all his long\r\nlife to render justice to the poor boy's memory. To him, indeed, it was\r\nmainly owing, that the cenotaph to which we have referred (and which now\r\nlies mouldering in the Church vault), was erected in the graveyard of\r\nRedcliffe Church, by subscription, of which the contributions of Bristol\r\nwere very small.[12]\r\n\r\nChatterton was another warning, not only\r\n\r\n               \"Against self-slaughter\r\n    There is a prohibition so divine--\"\r\n\r\nbut that no mortal should ever abandon Hope! for a reverend\r\ngentleman,--who was, in all things, what, unhappily, Horace Walpole was\r\nnot,--had actually visited Bristol, to seek out and aid the boy while he\r\nlay dead in London.\r\n\r\n    \"Beware of desperate steps; the darkest day,\r\n    Live till to-morrow, will have passed away.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHATTERTON'S MONUMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of these facts cheered us as we set forth to the\r\nneighborhood of Shoe-Lane to see the spot where he had been laid. Alas,\r\nit is very hard to keep pace with the progress of London changes. After\r\nvarious inquiries, we were told that Mr. Bentley's printing office\r\nstands upon the ground of Shoe-Lane Workhouse. We ascended the steps\r\nleading to this shifting emporium of letters, and found ourselves face\r\nto face with a kind gentleman, who told us all he knew upon the subject,\r\nwhich was, that the printing office stands--not upon the burying-ground\r\nof Shoe-Lane Workhouse, where he had always understood Chatterton was\r\nburied--but upon the church burial-ground. He showed us a very curious\r\nbasso-relievo, in cut-stone, of the Resurrection, which he assured us\r\nhad been \"time out of mind\" above the entrance to the Shoe-Lane\r\nburying-place \"over the way,\" and which is now the site of Farrington\r\nMarket. This, when \"all the bones\" were moved to the old graveyard in\r\nGray's Inn Road, had come \"somehow\" into Mr. Bentley's possession.\r\n\r\nWe were told also that Mr. Taylor, another printer, had lived, before\r\nthe workhouse was pulled down, where his office-window looked upon the\r\nspot pointed out as the grave of Chatterton, and that a stone, \"a rough\r\nwhite stone,\" was remembered to have been \"set in a wall\" near the grave\r\nwith \"Thomas Chatterton\" and something else \"scratched\" into it.\r\n\r\nWe strayed back through the damp chill of the city's evening fog to the\r\nmarket-place, hoping, even unconsciously, to stand beside the pit into\r\nwhich the marvellous boy had been thrust; but we grew bewildered. And as\r\nwe stood upon the steps looking down upon the market--alone in feeling,\r\nand unconscious of every thing but our own thoughts--St. Paul's bell\r\nstruck, full, loud, and clear; and, casting our eyes upward, we saw its\r\nmighty dome through the murky atmosphere. We became still more \"mazed,\"\r\nand fancied we were gazing upon the monument of Thomas Chatterton!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Of Edward Colston, well and beautifully has William Howitt said,\r\n\"You cannot help feeling the grand beneficence of those wealthy\r\nmerchants, who, like Edward Colston, make their riches do their generous\r\nwill for ever; who become thereby the actual fathers of their native\r\ncities to all generations; who roll off, every year of the world's\r\nprogress, some huge stone of anxiety from the hearts of poor widows; who\r\nclear the way before the unfriended, but active and worthy lad; who put\r\nforth their invisible hands from the heaven of their rest, and become\r\nthe genuine guardian angels of the orphan race for ever and ever:\r\nraising from those who would otherwise have been outcasts and ignorant\r\nlaborers, aspiring and useful men; tradesmen of substance; merchants the\r\ntrue enrichers of their country, and fathers of happy families. How\r\nglorious is such a lot! how noble is such an appropriation of wealth!\r\nhow enviable is such a fame! And amongst such men there were few more\r\ntruly admirable than Edward Colston! He was worthy to have been lifted\r\nby Chatterton, to the side of the magnificent Canynge, and one cannot\r\nhelp wondering that he says so little about this great benefactor of his\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Our engraving shows this house, and Bristol Bridge, both memorable\r\nas being connected with the earliest of Chatterton's fabrications.\r\nBristol Bridge was finished in September, 1768, and in the October\r\nfollowing Chatterton sent to \"Felix Farley's Bristol Journal,\" the\r\ncuriously detailed account of the ceremonial observances on opening the\r\nancient bridge at Bristol, 'taken from an Old Manuscript,' and which,\r\nbeing his first printed forgery, led, by the attention it excited, to\r\nthe production of other work, and among them the Rowley Poems. At this\r\ntime he was in his 16th year; but some years before he had fabricated\r\nBurgum's pedigree, and some poetry by a pretended ancestor of his, of\r\nthe alleged date of 1320, called \"The Romaunte of the Knyghte.\" The\r\nhouse where Burgum lived, and where Chatterton first tried his powers of\r\ndeception, is the central one of the three seen above the bridge in our\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n[3] The place of Chatterton's birth has been variously stated: Mr. Dix,\r\nin his \"Life of Chatterton,\" has mentioned _three_. His first being that\r\n\"he was born on the 29th of November, in the year 1752, in a house\r\nsituated on Redcliff Hill, behind the shop now (1837) occupied by Mr.\r\nHasell, grocer,\" and which has since been destroyed. But in the appendix\r\nto his volume is a communication stating that Mrs. Newton (Chatterton's\r\nmarried sister) left a daughter who \"died in 1807, in the house where\r\nChatterton was born; I believe in the arch at Cathay,\" a street leading\r\nfrom the church-yard to the river-side. But the most certain account\r\nseems to be that of Mrs. Edkins (also printed by Dix) who \"went to\r\nschool to Chatterton's father, and was present when the son was born, at\r\nthe Pyle School.\" Now, as Chatterton was born about three months after\r\nhis father's death, and he had been for some years master of the school,\r\nit is unlikely that his wife would be removed from the house she\r\ninhabited until after her confinement, \"when,\" says Mrs. Edkins, \"she\r\nwent to a house opposite the upper gate on Redcliff Hill.\" The house\r\nappropriated to the master of Pyle Street School is shown in our\r\nengraving, it is at the back of the school, which faces the street, and\r\nis approached by an open passage on one side of it leading into a small\r\ncourt-yard, beyond which is a little garden. Over the door is inserted a\r\nstone, inscribed, \"This house was erected by Giles Malpas, of St. Thomas\r\nParish, Gent., for the use of the master of this School, A. D. 1749.\"\r\nThe house has but two sitting rooms, one on each side of the door, that\r\nto the right being the kitchen; and in one of them the dissolute father\r\nof the Poet is said by Dix to have \"often passed the whole night roaring\r\nout catches, with some of the lowest rabble of the parish.\" He was\r\nsucceeded in the office of Schoolmaster by Edmond Chard, who held it for\r\nfive years; and he was followed in 1757 by Stephen Love, who was master\r\ntwenty-one years, and to whom Mrs. Chatterton first sent her son for\r\neducation; and who, \"after exhausting the patience of his schoolmaster,\r\nwas sent back to his mother with the character of a stupid boy, and one\r\nwho was absolutely incapable of receiving instruction.\"\r\n\r\n[4] This School, founded in 1708 by Edward Colston, Esq., is situated in\r\na street called St. Augustine's Back, behind the houses facing the\r\ndrawbridge. It is the mansion in which Queen Elizabeth was entertained\r\nwhen she visited the city; and was purchased by Colston, because of its\r\napplicability to his charitable purposes. Here the scholars are boarded,\r\nlodged, and clothed, and are never permitted to be absent--except on\r\nSaturdays and Saints' days, from one till seven. They are simply taught\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic. The school-room is on the first floor,\r\nand runs along the entire front of the building; the bed-rooms are the\r\nlarge airy rooms above. Behind the house is a paved yard for exercise.\r\nChatterton remained here about seven years.\r\n\r\n[5] The gate seen at the side of Colston's School in our cut, is that by\r\nwhich the school is entered; a narrow paved passage beside the house\r\nconducts to the angle of the building, when you turn to the left, and so\r\nreach the house by an open court-yard. In the corner of this angle,\r\ncommanding a view of the entrance to the school, and also of the outer\r\ngate, is placed the doorkeeper's lodge delineated in our cut. It is a\r\nsmall building of brick, covered with lead, about six feet in height. It\r\nhas within an iron seat, and an iron ledge for books. The windows are\r\nunglazed; and in winter it must be singularly uncomfortable,\r\nparticularly as the occupant must traverse the length of the yard in all\r\nweathers. It is said to be the intention of the authorities to remove\r\nthis little building; this is to be regretted, as it is almost the only\r\nunchanged memorial of her poet-boy which Bristol possesses. It was\r\ncustomary for the boys to take the office of doorkeeper in rotation for\r\nthe term of one week; and it was in Chatterton's twelfth year, when he\r\nwas doorkeeper, that he wrote here his first poem \"On the Last Epiphany,\r\nor Christ coming to Judgment.\"\r\n\r\n[6] Lambert's first office was on St. John's Steps; but the unceasing\r\nspirit of change, which has more or less destroyed all the Bristol\r\nlocalities connected with Chatterton, has swept this one away; \"the\r\nSteps\" have now been turned into a sloping ascent, and the old houses\r\nremoved or renovated. Shortly after he had entered Lambert's service,\r\nhis office was removed to Corn Street, and here, from the house\r\ndelineated in our cut, he dated his first communication to Horace\r\nWalpole. It is immediately in front of the Exchange, and although the\r\nlower part has been altered frequently within remembrance, the upper\r\npart remains as when Lambert rented it. It may be noted, that the upper\r\nfloors of the adjacent houses are still devoted to lawyers' and\r\nmerchants' offices.\r\n\r\n[7] The great Bristol merchant, William Canynge, jun., is buried in\r\nRedcliffe Church, to which he was a great benefactor, as he was to the\r\ncity of Bristol generally. He entered the church to avoid a second\r\nmarriage, and was made Dean of the College of Westbury, which he had\r\nrebuilt. There are two monuments to his memory in Redcliffe Church, both\r\nof which are seen in our engraving. One is a raised altar tomb with an\r\nenriched canopy; and upon the tomb lie the effigies of Canynge and his\r\nwife in the costume of the fifteenth century. The other tomb is of\r\nsimilar construction, and is believed to have been brought here from\r\nWestbury College; it represents Canynge in his clerical robes, his head\r\nsupported by angels, and resting his feet on the figure of a Saracen.\r\nHere Chatterton frequently ruminated; indeed, the whole church abounds\r\nwith memorials which call to mind the sources of his inspiration; near\r\nthe door is an effigy inscribed \"Johannes Lamyngton,\" which gave name to\r\none of his forgeries. He was never weary of rambling in and about the\r\nchurch, and all his early works originated here.\r\n\r\n[8] The muniment-room is a large low-roofed apartment over the beautiful\r\nnorth porch of Redcliffe Church, which was constructed by Canynge. It is\r\nhexagonal, and lighted by narrow unglazed windows. The floor rests on\r\nthe groined stones of the porch, strong beams of oak forming its roof.\r\nIt is secured by two massive doors in the narrow passage leading from\r\nthe stairs into it. Here were preserved several large chests, and among\r\nthem _Canynge's cofre_; from which Chatterton assured the world he had\r\nobtained the Rowley MSS.; and from which MSS. were carried away and\r\ndestroyed, but the old chests still remain. There are seven in all, and\r\nthey bear traces of great antiquity. Many have been strongly bound with\r\niron, but all are now in a state of decay. This lonely cheerless room,\r\nstrewn with antique fragments and suggestive of the boy-poet's\r\nday-dreams, is certainly the most interesting relic in Bristol. Its\r\ncomfortless neglect is a true epitome of the life of him who first\r\nshaped his course from his reveries within it.\r\n\r\n[9] The house said to be that of Canynge is situated in Redcliffe\r\nStreet, not very far from the church. It is now occupied by a\r\nbookseller, who uses the fine hall seen in our cut, as a storehouse for\r\nhis volumes. Chatterton frequently mentions this \"house nempte the rodde\r\nlodge;\" and in Skelton's \"Etchings of Bristol Antiquities\" is an\r\nengraving of this building, there called \"Canynge's chapel or Masonic\r\nHall,\" showing the painting in the arch at the back, representing the\r\nfirst person of the Trinity, supporting the crucified Saviour, angels at\r\neach side censing, and others bearing shields. This was \"the Rood\" with\r\nwhich Chatterton was familiar, and which induced him to give the name to\r\nCanynge's house in his fabrications. This painting is now destroyed, but\r\nwe have restored it from Skelton's plate in our engraving.\r\n\r\n[10] The monk Rowley was altogether an imaginary person conjured up by\r\nChatterton as a vehicle for his wonderful forgeries. He was described by\r\nhim as the intimate friend of Canynge, his constant companion, and a\r\ncollector of books and drawings for him. It has been well remarked, that\r\nalthough it was _extraordinary_ for a lad to have written them in the\r\n18th century, it was _impossible_ for a monk to have written them in the\r\n15th. Indeed, it seems now both curious and amusing that his forgeries\r\nshould have deceived the learned. When Rowley talks of purchasing his\r\nhouse \"on a repayring lease for ninety-nine years.\" We at once smile,\r\nand remember his fellow-forger Ireland's Shaksperian _Promissory_ note,\r\nbefore such things were invented. Our fac-simile of the pretended\r\nRowley's writing is obtained from the very curious collection of\r\nChatterton's manuscripts in the British Museum. It is written at the\r\nbottom of some drawings of monumental slabs and notes, stated to have\r\nbeen \"collected ande gotten for Mr. William Canynge, by mee, Thomas\r\nRowley.\" There are, however, other autographs of Rowley in the\r\ncollection, so entirely dissimilar in the formation of the letters, that\r\nit might be expected to have induced a conviction of forgery. Many of\r\nthe manuscripts too are still more dissimilar; and the construction of\r\nthe letters totally unlike any of the period. Some are written on little\r\nfragments not more than three inches square, the writing sometimes neat\r\nand clean, at other times bad, rambling and unintelligible. The best is\r\nthe account of Canynge's feast, which has been engraved in fac-simile by\r\nStrutt, to the edition of Rowley's Poems, 1777. The writing is generally\r\nbolder than Barrett's fac-simile; and that gentleman, in endeavoring to\r\nrevive the faded ink, has greatly injured the originals, which are now\r\nin some cases almost indistinguishable. The drawings of pretended\r\nancient coins and heraldry are absurdly inventive: and the\r\nrepresentations of buildings exactly such as a boy without knowledge of\r\ndrawing or architecture would fabricate; yet they imposed on Barrett who\r\nengraved them for his history of Bristol. Many of his transcripts show\r\nthe shifts the poor boy was put to for paper; torn fragments and backs\r\nof law bills are frequently employed. Among the rest is a collection of\r\nextracts from Chaucer to aid him in the fabrication of his MSS. The\r\nwhole is exceedingly instructive and curious.\r\n\r\n[11] This gentleman was the proprietor of the \"Bristol Journal,\" to\r\nwhich Chatterton sent his first forgery; and with whom he afterwards\r\nbecame intimate.\r\n\r\n[12] The cenotaph erected to Chatterton, in 1838, from a design by S. C.\r\nFripp, has now been removed; it stood close to the north porch, beside\r\nthe steps leading into it. One of the inscriptions, which he directs in\r\nhis will to be placed on his tomb, has been adopted. \"To the Memory of\r\nThomas Chatterton. Reader, judge not, if thou art a Christian. Believe\r\nthat he shall be judged by a superior Power. To that Power alone is he\r\nnow answerable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors and Books.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf personalities, &c. a few words: Every man or woman coming before the\r\npublic voluntarily--especially every man or woman placing his or her\r\nname upon the title of a book--submits so much of his or her being and\r\ncharacter to the general criticism. It is crime to make public use of\r\nprivate conversation; it is crime, under most circumstances, to disclose\r\nthe secret of an anonymous authorship; it is crime in all cases to\r\ninvade any privacy, or comment on any purely personal matter, that has\r\nnot by the interested party been offered for the world's examination. If\r\nany one publish a work of pure art, it is entirely inexcusable to\r\nsuggest any illustrations of it from his life or condition, unless by\r\nhis own express or implied permission. For example, if \"The Princess,\"\r\nby Tennyson, had been printed anonymously by some notorious thief,\r\nburglar, forger, or murderer, he would be as great a villain as the\r\nauthor, who, in reviewing the poem, should in any manner whatever allude\r\nto the author's sins. The extent to which this law may be applied can\r\neasily be understood. To a gentleman the law itself is an instinct.\r\nPersonal rights are frequently violated by praise as well as by censure,\r\nand sometimes applause is not in any degree less offensive than\r\ndenunciation, though commonly men will forgive even the most unskilful\r\nand injudicious commendation. In both ways the writers of this country\r\nare apt to err.\r\n\r\nWhile we agree with the most fastidious, in asserting that inviolability\r\nof one's individualism, not by himself submitted for public observation,\r\nwe contend for the right and duty of the utmost freedom in the\r\ndissection of what is thus submitted. Public speech, public action,\r\npublic character, are adventures upon the sea of the world's opinion,\r\nand they must brave its winds or be sunk or wrecked by them,--the\r\nperson, so far as he is not involved, meanwhile safely watching from the\r\nshore for results.\r\n\r\nIn the most careful applications of this principle, it is inevitable\r\nthat wrong is done sometimes; but when the wrong is not personal, it is\r\nfor the most part susceptible of remedy. The author may challenge\r\ninvestigation of his book, the artist of his picture, the officer of his\r\nadministration. If there has been unfair severity of criticism, they are\r\nlikely to gain by it in the end, for every critic must justify upon\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nThere is a distinction in the cases of the dead. The world in an\r\nespecial manner becomes the heir of a life which is abandoned by its\r\nmaster. This has been held by the wise in all ages and all states of\r\nsociety. The justice of the distinction is very apparent: An invasion of\r\nthe individualism of the living destroys, or to a greater or less extent\r\naffects, the freedom, and so the right and wrong, of his conduct, while\r\nthe secrets of the dead are to the living only as logic.\r\n\r\nThere are very few men who are not more willing to praise than to blame.\r\nThe better portion of men prefer to hear the praises even of strangers.\r\nTherefore censors are held to stricter account than eulogists. But a\r\nnatural love of justice is continually at war with feelings of personal\r\nkindness. It is impossible to see insolent and vulgar pretension in\r\nnoisy triumph, while real and unobtrusive merit is neglected. When we\r\nsee a creature strutting in laurels that have been won by another, human\r\nnature--much as it has been abused--prompts us to grasp them from\r\nundeserving brows and place them where they will have a natural grace.\r\nFor trite examples, who would not rather elect Columbus than Americus to\r\nthe place of Name-Giver for this continent? who does not rejoice that\r\nfinally Hadley is proved a swindler of the fame of Godfrey, in the\r\nmatter of the quadrant? How many such wrongs do men daily hope to see\r\nrighted!\r\n\r\nThe writer of these paragraphs will never willingly violate the just\r\nconditions of criticism. If he offers, as often is necessary,\r\nconclusions rather than arguments, he will in no case withhold arguments\r\nwhen conclusions are held to be unjust. The true value of every sort of\r\njournalism, and of discussion also, is in its integrity much more than\r\nin its ability. Integrity is violated as much by the suppression of\r\ntruth as by the suggestion of falsehood. In all cases that interest us\r\nsufficiently, and which are legitimately before the public, we shall\r\nwrite precisely as we think, without the slightest regard for\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOERSTED, the great natural philosopher, has lately published at Leipzic,\r\nunder the title of _Der in Geist in der Natur_ (Spirit in Nature), a\r\ncollection of remarkable essays which he has written, at various times,\r\nduring a series of years. The purpose he has followed through his entire\r\nscientific career, has, perhaps, its most complete expression in this\r\nbook. It is the demonstration of the same laws in physical nature as in\r\nthe higher spheres of the reason and intelligence. On the principle of\r\nthe essential unity of all things, he seeks not only to lay the\r\nfoundation of a universal science, but to afford some views of the\r\nsuperstructure. The work contains eight distinct essays: the first, \"The\r\nSpiritual in the Corporeal,\" is in the form of a Dialogue, and aims at a\r\nreconciliation of the conflicting modes of thought, by which the\r\nuniverse is assumed to be essentially material, or essentially\r\nspiritual; the second, \"The Fountain,\" treats of the impressions of\r\nbeauty produced by the great, sublime, and powerful; the third considers\r\nthe relation to the imagination, of the apprehension of nature by the\r\nunderstanding, and shows that it is only imperfect culture and ignorance\r\nwhich can suppose any dissonance between the two. He shows that the\r\nprogress of science enriches, aggrandizes, and elevates the imagination.\r\nThe fourth essay is, perhaps, the most interesting of all. Its theme is,\r\n\"Superstition and Skepticism in their relation to Natural Science.\" The\r\nnotion that superstition is favorable to poesy, he dissipates with\r\nmasterly conclusiveness. The true realm of beauty is the realm of\r\nreason. It is true that science deprives the poet of the use of sundry\r\nunnatural conceptions, but while it more than compensates him by the\r\nsubstitution of nobler ideas, it opens to him a new, affluent, and\r\nlittle explored poetic world. \"It can,\" he says, \"not be charged as a\r\ncrime upon natural science, that it has destroyed materials hitherto\r\nused by the poets. Such losses are of small consequence to the true\r\npoet, but may, indeed, be painful to the many dabblers in the poetic\r\nart, who think they have rendered the insignificant poetic by tricking\r\nit out in gewgaws from the poetic armory of a vanished era.\" The fifth,\r\nentitled, \"The Existence of all things in the Domain of Reason,\" is the\r\nprofoundest and most significant of these essays, and more than the\r\nothers brings out in form as simple and popular as could be expected,\r\nthe fundamental idea of the author's system of thought. It asserts that\r\nthere is, throughout the universe, a radical unity between the laws of\r\nbeauty, and man's moral nature and intellectual powers, and that there\r\nmust therefore exist for the mind, a perfect community of nature and\r\nanalogy between different worlds, and a rational connection between all\r\nthinking beings, not only of the earth, but of other planets and\r\nsystems. The final essay is on \"The Culture of Science as the Exercise\r\nof Religion,\" and is mainly an attempt to show that the very nature of\r\nscience requires its culture to be made a religion, and that _the good\r\nwhich we ought to seek must be that which is imperishable in its truth_.\r\n\r\nThis work has been rapidly followed by two other publications of the\r\nsame author, intended to explain or defend the positions of their\r\npredecessor. The first is called, \"Natural Science in its Connection\r\nwith Poetic Art and Religion.\" It was written in reply to the criticism\r\nof a learned and respected friend of the author, Bishop Mynster of\r\nSeeland. The second has for its title, \"Natural Science and the\r\nFormation of the Intellect.\"\r\n\r\nOersted is now seventy-three years old. It is admirable to see a man of\r\nsuch years and distinction in the world, putting forth the same grand\r\nand elevated ideas that marked the generous enthusiasm of his youth. It\r\nis only in the genial and unselfish pursuits of science that such\r\nfreshness of mind can be thus preserved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEW DRAMAS.--Among the new dramas of any value, produced in Germany,\r\n_Herodes und Mariamne_, a five act tragedy, by Hebbel, deserves\r\nparticular mention. The persons are too numerous, and the action too\r\ncomplicated, but there is great fire and energy in the general\r\ntreatment, and the gradual development of the interest of the story is\r\nmanaged with skill. Herod, the ruler of Judea, is a tyrant by both\r\nnature and position. He was appointed to his office by the Roman\r\ntriumvir Antony, who can turn him out or cut his head off at any moment,\r\nand who is strongly inclined to follow the urgent solicitations of\r\nHerod's many enemies. In order to secure himself, Herod has married\r\nMariamne, a descendant of the Jewish royal family, and is deeply in love\r\nwith her. The chief of his foes is Mariamne's mother; the Pharisees also\r\nhate him for his notorious disregard of the Jewish religion. A\r\nconspiracy is formed against him, at the head of which is the brother of\r\nMariamne. This brother is killed in consequence, and Herod is summoned\r\nbefore the triumvir. Meanwhile, as soon as the murder was known,\r\nMariamne had refused to see her husband. But the evidences of his\r\nattachment are still so convincing, and her admiration for the force of\r\nhis character so great, that she becomes reconciled to him. He is about\r\nto leave her to appear before Antony, and asks if her love is great\r\nenough for her to commit suicide, in case he should not return. Finally\r\nhe asks her to take an oath to that effect. But she refuses, saying that\r\nsuch an oath would give him no pledge that he might not have already\r\nfrom insight into her heart. He is not content with this, and before he\r\nleaves, engages an assassin to kill her in case Antony should put him to\r\ndeath. After his departure, Mariamne declares to her mother that in case\r\nHerod perishes, she has determined to kill herself. The report arrives\r\nthat he has been executed; and the assassin appears; from his bearing\r\nMariamne guesses the truth, and draws from him a confession. Just as she\r\nis in the deepest agitation at this discovery, the king appears, having\r\nbeen acquitted by Antony. She meets him with coldness, and at once lets\r\nhim know that she has learned all. He puts to death the man, but at the\r\nsame time a suspicion arises in his mind that Mariamne has discovered\r\nthe secret by betraying her honor. Against this her pride will not allow\r\nher to defend herself. A second trial soon arrives. Herod receives the\r\norder--shortly before the battle of Actium--to go on a dangerous\r\nmilitary expedition for Antony. He now requires no oath, at which she\r\nrejoices; for she still loves him, and forgives him for the past. But\r\nshe does not reveal herself to him. He misunderstands the joy which she\r\ncannot conceal, as satisfaction at his departure, and charges a faithful\r\nservant to put her to death in case he shall fall. The report of his\r\ndeath is renewed, but the appointed assassin, revolted at his office,\r\ndiscloses all to Mariamne. This drives her to despair. She is confident\r\nthat her husband will soon return, and determines that he shall be led\r\nto put her to death unjustly. Accordingly she gives a splendid feast, as\r\nshe says, to celebrate the death of her husband. He comes and brings her\r\nbefore a court, not for having rejoiced at his death, but for\r\ninfidelity, supposing that to be the only way in which she could have\r\ndiscovered the secret of the assassin. She is condemned and executed,\r\nbut before dying, she reveals the whole mystery to a friend, who\r\nafterwards informs Herod. The king devoured by rage and remorse and\r\ndriven to desperation, becomes merciless as a fury. It is at that\r\nmoment, that the three wise men from the East arrive, and inform him of\r\nthe birth of Christ; whereupon he orders the slaughter of the children.\r\nOne of the peculiarities of this tragedy, is the introduction of a\r\ncharacter, who takes no part in the action, but observes and\r\nphilosophizes upon it, somewhat after the manner of the old Greek\r\nchorus. This innovation cannot be said to be successful; moreover there\r\nis generally too much philosophizing and moralizing in the piece.\r\n\r\nAnother new German tragedy is called _Francisco da Rimini_, by Cornelius\r\nVon der Heyse, but we know nothing more respecting it than is\r\ncommunicated by the publisher's advertisement. The title is promising.\r\n\r\nThe French dramatists produce more comedies than tragedies. Indeed, in\r\nthe weekly notices which for the last few weeks our Parisian papers have\r\ngiven of the new works brought out at the various theatres of Paris, we\r\nhave not observed one tragedy of importance enough for us to remark upon\r\nit. But in the lighter range of comedy, the French playwrights are\r\nunequalled and inexhaustible, as is proved by the constant transfer of\r\ntheir productions into both the English and German languages. They do\r\nnot think it necessary to have a plot of much intricacy, or even of\r\ngreat interest. The point and brilliancy of the dialogue, and the\r\nperfection of the actors, render that a matter of subordinate\r\nconsequence. _The Two Eagles_, by Bayard and Bieville (these\r\npartnerships are frequent among the dramatists of Paris), was brought\r\nout at the _Theatre Montansier_. Hippolyte Vidoux, clerk in a cap store\r\nand lieutenant in the National Guards, is a charming fellow, and the\r\nidol of the women in the whole quarter. He sings, jokes, and dances the\r\npolka in every style. He is introduced into the salons of his superior\r\nofficer, Count Chamaral, but meets with no sort of success among the\r\nmarchionesses and duchesses. On the other hand, these ladies are dying\r\nfor the young Baron Albert, who dances the contra-dance with a mien of\r\nlanguishing resignation worthy of a funeral. The Baron falls in love\r\nwith the daughter of a rich baker, but in vain. Here Hippolyte carries\r\noff the honors and the heiress according to the French proverb, _the\r\neagle of one house is a turkey in another_. At the _Opera Comique_, a\r\npiece in one act, _The Peasant_, by Alboize, music by Poisat is one of\r\nthe latest novelties. A proud and obstinate German Baron refuses his\r\ndaughter's hand to her lover, whose great merit nevertheless causes him\r\nto be ennobled. Still the Baron refuses his daughter. \"What!\" he says,\r\n\"shall I marry my child to a new-baked nobleman?\" But as good luck would\r\nhave it, the Emperor Joseph happens along in disguise, on one of his\r\nexcursions for relieving virtue and unmasking vice. The Baron receives\r\nhim, but has nothing to set before him. Hereupon a gardener furnishes a\r\ndeer, which saves the honor of the house. The Emperor is delighted with\r\nthe venison, and makes the donor sit down at the table. He is the father\r\nof the suitor, and as he has thus had the honor to eat with the Emperor,\r\nthe Baron can say nothing more against the marriage. The good Emperor\r\nblesses the happy pair, and sets off again to see if there are no more\r\ncomic operas in his dominions to which he can contribute a happy\r\ndenouement. At the _Theatre des Varietes_ has been produced the _Ring of\r\nSolomon_, in one act, by Henry Berthoud. The scene is laid in Holland,\r\nin the winter, which affords an excellent opportunity to the\r\nscene-painter and property-man. Threa, a poor and silly girl, is so\r\npassionately in love with Hans, who has saved her from death, that she\r\nclimbs a wall to see him as he is going by. The wall tumbles down with\r\nher, and among the fragments she finds the ring of Solomon, and puts it\r\non. At once she is surrounded by fairies, in the well-known ballet\r\ncostume, who carry her off into a Dutch paradise, where she also becomes\r\na fairy, and undergoes a remarkable improvement in her wits. But this\r\ndoes not bring any change in her passion for Hans, and she prefers to be\r\nunhappy with him to floating for ever through the aerial joys of\r\nfairydom without him. Accordingly, she renounces the privilege conferred\r\non her by the ring, and is rewarded for so much virtue by passing\r\nthrough a new transformation, after which she appears as a most lovely\r\npeasantess, and marries Hans to the universal satisfaction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGERMAN NOVELS.--The bookstores of Germany now swarm with new novels,\r\nsome of which we have already noticed. _Modern Titans: Little People in\r\na Great Epoch_, from the press of Bookhaus, seems to be written with the\r\nexpress purpose of introducing all the notabilities of Berlin, Breslau\r\nand Vienna, and is not successful. The name of the author is not given.\r\n_Der Tannhausen_ treats of suicide, republicanism, the identity of God\r\nand the universe, faith, skepticism, Christ, marriage, the emancipation\r\nof woman, and whatsoever new-fangled and startling ideas and phrases the\r\nauthor has met with in the activity of this busy age. This book is also\r\ncharged with outrageous personalities. _George Volker_, a Romance of the\r\nyear 1848, by Otto Mueller, 3 vols., is of course, a revolutionary story.\r\nThe hero is so unfortunate as to be in love with two women at a time,\r\nthe one a country, and the other a peasant girl. He engages in the\r\nBadian insurrection, is about to be arrested, and thereupon gets out of\r\nall his difficulties by shooting himself. _Der Sohn des Volkes_, by\r\nLeoni Schucking, takes its subject and plot from the French Revolution\r\nand its influence on Germany. It is written with talent, and is\r\naltogether in the interest of the aristocracy. _Der Bettler von James's\r\nPark_ (the Beggar of James's Park), by Alexander Jung, is not\r\nrevolutionary but tragic and sentimental. At the same time, it is\r\ndidactic, and sets forth sundry ideas with reference to love, God, and\r\nliberty. But the story deserves more than a line in these columns, were\r\nit only as a literary curiosity. The hero is haunted by the notion that\r\na great misfortune will fall upon his family, whenever a travelling\r\ndealer shall offer an _ecce homo_ for sale to any one of its members.\r\nUnluckily, such a picture is offered to himself, and he almost loses his\r\nwits at it. Hereupon he goes to see the young lady with whom he is in\r\nlove, and finds her dying. This quite upsets him, and he goes crazy,\r\nand, in this condition, becomes a beggar in the London streets. At the\r\nbeginning, he is very lean, and is so well suited to this trade, that he\r\nis even made a member of the beggars' guild. But ill luck still pursues\r\nhim; he becomes excessively fat, and gains a belly of most aldermanic\r\nproportions. Here a lord takes him up as an object at once of study and\r\nphilanthropy, but not with sufficient interest in him to provide for his\r\nsupport. Alms he gets none; next, he is turned out of the guild, and, at\r\nlast, is taken to a hospital, where he loses his flesh, and regains his\r\nreason. Finally, after passing through a variety of other strange\r\nexperiences, he dies in tranquillity, wept by the same lord, and by the\r\nlady he had himself supposed to be dead; but who, instead of this, had\r\nbecome a nun in France. _Schnock_, a picture of life in the Netherlands,\r\nis by Frederich Hebbel, a man of some distinction, as a dramatic writer,\r\nas we have noticed elsewhere. The general idea of this book is borrowed\r\nfrom Jean Paul's _Journey of the Chaplain Schmelzle_. The hero is a man\r\nof weak and timid character, married to a woman of unsparing energy and\r\nresolution. The style and execution of the work are clumsy, exaggerated\r\nand abominable. _Handel und Wandel_ (Doings and Viewings), by\r\nHacklaender, is worthy of all praise, as a faithful and vivid picture of\r\nGerman rural and domestic life. The characters are all human, the action\r\nsimple and direct, and the tone healthy and agreeable. Hacklaender is an\r\nexception to the mass of modern German novelists, of whom, taking them\r\ntogether, as may be judged from the brief remarks above, no great good\r\ncan be said.\r\n\r\n_Ein Dunkles Loss_ (A Dark Destiny), by L. Bechstein, is a socialist\r\nbook, which, in the form of a novel, discusses questions relating to\r\nart, not without genuine insight and original power of thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTESS HAHN-HAHN, the bravest and decidedly the cleverest of the\r\nwomen who have written books of Oriental travel, and whose\r\n\"latitudinarian\" novels constitute a remarkable portion of the recent\r\nromantic literature of Germany, we perceive has entered a convent. The\r\n_Ladies' Companion_ exclaims hereof:--\r\n\r\n     \"When will the wild and the restless learn self-distrust\r\n     from the histories of kindred spirits? And, observing how\r\n     the pendulum must vibrate (as in Madame Hahn-Hahn's case)\r\n     from utter disdain of social laws, to the most superstitious\r\n     form of association under authority--how, almost always, to\r\n     defiance must succeed a desire for reconciliation. When will\r\n     they become chary of pouring out their laments, their\r\n     attacks, their complaints, seeing that similar protestations\r\n     are almost certainly followed by after repentance and\r\n     recantation!\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess Hahn-Hahn unfortunately has but one eye, and she is\r\notherwise astonishingly ugly. So we may account for a very large\r\nproportion of the eccentricities of the sex. Had she been in this\r\ncountry she would have presided at the late Woman's Rights Convention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo modern man has been more written about than GOETHE, and the end of\r\nbooks concerning him seems to be still distant. The last that we hear of\r\nis called _Goethe's Dichterwerth_ (Value of Goethe as a Poet), written\r\nby O. L. Hoffman, and published in the quaint old city of Nuremberg. It\r\ntreats first of the poet's relation to natural science, art and society:\r\nnext takes up the complaints of his antagonists; his poetic character;\r\nhis youthful productions; his lyrics; Goetz von Berlichingen; the Sorrows\r\nof Werter; the influence of Italy on his mature mind; Egmont; Iphigenia\r\nat Tauris; Tasso; the influence of the French Revolution; his relations\r\nwith Schiller; his Ballads; Hermann and Dorothea; the Natural Daughter;\r\nWilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship; and finally the productions of his\r\nmature years, as Wilhelm Meister's Wander-years, the Elective\r\nAffinities, and Faust. The work forms a complete commentary on the works\r\nof Goethe, and is written in the warmest spirit of admiration for his\r\ngenius and influence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHAGEN'S _Geschichte der Neuesten Zeit_ (History of Recent Times) is\r\nworthy a place in the library of every historical student. It begins\r\nwith the downfall of Napoleon and is to come down to the present day.\r\nThe first volume has been published; it exhibits thorough mastery of the\r\nmaterials, and great calmness and judgment in their use. The style is\r\nclear, terse and graphic. The author, who is a professor of the\r\nUniversity of Heidelberg, is a decided republican.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOTTA'S splendid illustrated edition of the Bible (Luther's version) is\r\nnow finished. It is perhaps the best Illustrated Bible ever published.\r\nThe typography and woodcuts are admirable. Of the latter there are\r\neighty, after original designs by Jaeger, Overbeck, Schnorr, and others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFALLERMAYER, the distinguished German traveller, is about abandoning the\r\nfruitless polemics which have gained him so many foes, to devote himself\r\nto more useful labors. He himself desires to be at peace with all the\r\nworld, and the antagonists which his trenchant pen has so often\r\nunsparingly scarified, need fear him no longer. He is about to complete\r\nand print the third volume of his Oriental Impressions of Travel. This\r\nis reason for rejoicing. Fallermayer is one of the most charming and\r\ninstructive of travel-writers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWALLON'S _Histoire de l'Esclavage dans l'Antiquite_, just published at\r\nParis, is a work of high value to those who wish to look into a branch\r\nof history hitherto comparatively little cultivated, but destined to\r\nattract the most profound attention. M. Wallon, who is one of the\r\ncandidates for the vacant seat in the French Academy, discusses in an\r\nexhaustive manner the origin of slavery in the antique world, the\r\ncondition of bondmen in the various nations, and the gradual development\r\nof the institution under all circumstances and in all countries. His\r\nbook is excellent for its manner, while in respect of matter the author\r\nhas drawn information from all accessible sources, and digested it with\r\njudgment and impartiality. Thus he has produced a worthy contribution to\r\nthat great but yet unwritten work, so full of both tragic and epic\r\nelements, the Annals of Labor. What a noble book might be made by some\r\ncompetent writer who should grapple with the whole subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE NARRATIVE of the United States South Sea Exploring Expedition, is\r\nbeing translated into German, and published by Cotta of Stuttgard.

KARL AUGUST ESPE, who for many years has filled the post of editor\r\nto Brockhaus's _Conversations-Lexicon_, the work which forms the basis\r\nof the Encyclopedia Americana, died near Leipzic on the 25th November\r\nlast. He was a man of great acquirements and unwearied industry, and was\r\nwell known and esteemed in the literary and scientific circles of the\r\ncontinent. He was born at Kuehren, in 1804, and went to Leipzic in 1832.\r\nBeside the great work above alluded to, he had charge of the annual\r\nmemoirs of the German Society for the study of the native language and\r\nantiquities. Nearly two years ago he was attacked by a fit of apoplexy,\r\nfrom the effect of which his mind did not recover. He has since been in\r\na lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEANDER'S Church History is printed as far as the year 1294.

This last volume of this great\r\nwork will shortly be printed. Neander's various posthumous works are of\r\nremarkable value, though very few of them are in a finished state.\r\nAccording to the _Methodist Quarterly_, always well informed upon such\r\nmatters, his exegetical Lectures upon the New Testament are of even\r\ngreater merit than his compositions in history.

He will soon publish the narrative of his travels, which have\r\nbeen in Oceanica, Polynesia, Brazil, Patagonia, Chili, Bolivia, Peru,\r\nEquador, New Grenada, Jamaica, Cuba, and the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBERANGER, at the last dates was, and for several weeks had been,\r\ndangerously ill, at his house at Passy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVERON, the editor of the Paris _Constitutionnel_, is a transcendent\r\nspecimen of the voluptuary. He is a large, fleshy, sensual, though by no\r\nmeans coarse-looking man, with the marks of high living and animal\r\nenjoyment on all his features. He first made a fortune by selling a\r\nquack medicine, after which he became proprietor of the\r\n_Constitutionnel_. His paper is conducted on the quack medicine\r\nprinciple, with a shrewd view to the profits, and represents the\r\nultra-conservative side on all public questions. Latterly Veron has made\r\nan arrangement with Louis Napoleon, by which it has become in some sort\r\nthe special organ of that functionary. This has made the editor doubly\r\nfamous, and in consequence of the crowd desiring to see him which\r\nsurrounded the Cafe de Paris, where he had long dined regularly every\r\nday, he has been compelled to abandon that elegant establishment, and\r\nset up a table for himself. He has done this in a princely manner, and\r\nfrom his position, and the Apicius-like dinners which he gives, finds no\r\ndifficulty in assembling at his daily banquets the elite of Parisian\r\n_viveurs_. Among his guests are M. Roqueplan, of the opera; M. Scribe,\r\nthe dramatist; Jules Janin; M. Bertin, editor of the _Journal des\r\nDebats_; M. Romieu, Mlle. Rachel, and Mlle. Brohan. In all some fifty\r\npersons have a standing invitation, and come when they choose. Covers\r\nare laid every day for twelve, and those who are there at the time,\r\nwhich is six o'clock, take their places. At half-past eight the host\r\nputs on his hat and departs, but the guests remain, and prolong the\r\nfestival at their pleasure. It is said that these dinners not only\r\ncombine every thing in the perfections of gastronomy, but that they are\r\nequally piquant for the wit and brilliancy of the conversation that\r\nattends them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEUGENE SUE is now a member of the French Assembly; but he still finds\r\ntime to labor for democracy and socialism with his pen. He has commenced\r\nthe publication in one of the journals of a new romance, called _La\r\nbonne Aventure_. From a few chapters, it is evident that it will possess\r\nthe enthralling interest of most of his works, and will display his\r\nvaried and vast talent in the portraiture of character and the invention\r\nof incident. He is as intent as ever Mr. Cooper was, upon making the\r\nnovel a teacher and illustrator of opinions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEORGE SAND has completed a new drama, which, from the title, _Le\r\nFamille du Charpentier_, we suspect to be taken out of her delightful\r\n_Compagnon du Tour de France_. She appears to be following in the\r\nfootsteps of Dumas, in arranging her novels into plays. She has met with\r\na severe check in the refusal of the authorities to allow a play from\r\nher pen to be produced at the Theatre St. Martin, entitled \"Claudia.\"\r\nEvery thing had been prepared for it, and considerable expense incurred,\r\nwhen the Censor refused to grant a license.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALPHONSE KARR, the French novelist, published for the late holidays a\r\nvery successful book called _Voyage autour de mon jardin_ (Journey\r\naround my garden). It is a prose poem in honor of nature and the joys\r\nwhich nature gives to the heart. Prince SOLTIKOFF has also brought out\r\nhis travels in India and Prussia in a splendid style. One of the most\r\nelegant and universally admired works of the season at Paris, is\r\n_Aix-les-Bains_, by Amedee Achard, illustrated by Eugene Ginain.\r\nAix-les-Bains is a favorite watering place in Savoy, and this book is an\r\naccount of a summer passed there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the number for the first of December, of the Paris _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_, a writer introduces and dissects poems, unedited until now in\r\nthe _Romance_ tongue, of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Two new\r\npublications from their collection of manuscripts, by the Toulouse\r\nAcademy of Floral Games, perfectly exhibit the state of the Romaunt\r\ntongue and poetry from 1324 to 1496.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ is an amusing paper by HENRI BLAZE, on\r\n_Verona and Marshal Radetzky_, where, among other matters, he touches\r\nupon _Romeo and Juliet_.

There are 297\r\ndifferent letters. Among the names of lay writers may be mentioned\r\nMontalembert, Charles Dupin, D'Arlincourt, Poujoulat and De Falloux. The\r\ncountry which furnishes relatively the fewest documents to this\r\ncollection, strange to say, is Italy, owing no doubt to the confused\r\nstate of the country politically. Asia, America, and even Oceanica here\r\ngive proofs that the Church has a hold among their populations, and that\r\nthey have sympathies ready in her behalf. It is well known, too, that\r\ntheir sympathies do not end in words merely, but were often, as in the\r\ncase of Mexico, splendidly and solidly evinced in behalf of the fugitive\r\nPius. Nothing could give a more striking idea of the great extent of\r\nCatholicism and the influence of the Church, than this book. From the\r\nTurkish empire it gives a letter of the Archbishop Primate of\r\nConstantinople, one from the Armenian Church in the same city, one from\r\nthe Apostolic Vicar of Bosnia, the Armenian Patriarch of Celicia,\r\nresident in Lebanon, the Archbishop of Laodicea, at Gazir in Lebanon,\r\nthe Syrian Patriarch of Aleppo, the Patriarch of the Melchitian Greeks,\r\nand the Patriarch of Antioch. From distant Asia the Apostolic Vicars of\r\nPondicherry and Bombay, the Apostolic Vicar of Japan, resident on the\r\nisland of Hong Kong, and the Superior of the Catholic community of Agra,\r\nin the Presidency of Calcutta, all have letters. North America furnishes\r\na good many; in the United States, the Archbishop of Baltimore leads the\r\nlist, in which the Bishops of Oregon and Natchez are included with\r\nothers. From Canada, the Archbishop of Quebec furnishes the principal\r\nletter. Mexico is remarkable for the number of its addresses; besides\r\nthe Metropolitan Chapter of the Capital, the Bishops of Guadalaxara,\r\nMichoacan, Yucatan, Sonora, Oaxaca and many others, are represented in\r\nthe book. The contributions from South America are few. The Archbishops\r\nof Lima and Santiago, in Peru and Chili, and the Monastery of Merze del\r\nCuzco alone furnish letters. From Brazil there is a letter of the\r\nArchbishop of Bahia only. The addresses from Australia and Oceanica are\r\nfrom the Archbishop of Sidney, and the Bishops of Melbourne and\r\nAuckland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe History, Condition and Prospects of Hayti, have been largely and\r\nably discussed lately in the Paris _Revue des Deux Mondes_, and in the\r\nNew York _Tribune_. Of an article in the former publication, the first\r\nthirty-three pages form an able survey of the history of Hayti since its\r\nindependence, and of the rule of Emperor Soulouque. Nowhere is there, in\r\nthe same compass, more of authentic information and acute remark upon\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUNDER the title of _L'Architecture du Cinquieme au Seizieme Siecle et\r\nles Arts qui en dependent_, M. JULES GAILHABAUD is now producing at\r\nParis a work of high value to the architect and antiquary. Many years\r\nspent in travels and special studies, and an extensive collection of\r\ninteresting documents, qualify him beyond all contemporaries for such an\r\nundertaking. He treats not merely the architecture of the middle ages,\r\nbut sculpture, mural painting, painting on glass, mosaic work, bronzes,\r\niron work, the furniture of churches, &c. The book is to be published in\r\nfifteen parts, quarto, with engravings on steel, or colored lithographs.\r\nEight parts are already published, containing remarkable specimens of\r\nthe Carlovingian, Roman, and _Renaissance_ architecture, a Templars'\r\nchurch, Moorish buildings, &c. The whole, when finished, will cost, at\r\nParis, from sixty to one hundred dollars, according to the kind of paper\r\non which the engravings are printed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMONG the periodical publications of Italy, the _Rivista Italiana_, a\r\nmonthly review issued at Turin, occupies a high place.

The collection consists of a series of letters addressed by Pope\r\nto his coadjutor Broome--of copies of Broome's replies--and of many\r\noriginal letters from Fenton (Pope's other coadjutor in the Odyssey),\r\nalso addressed to Broome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLORD BROUGHAM gave notice some six months ago, of his intention to visit\r\nthe United States, during the present month of February, but if it is\r\ntrue, as stated in the Liverpool _Albion_, that he has lost his sight\r\n(partly in consequence of some painful bodily infirmity with which he\r\nhas some time been afflicted), he of course will not come.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOF ALICE CAREY'S ballad entitled \"Jessie Carol,\" printed in the last\r\nnumber of the _International_, J. G. Whittier says, in the _Era_, that\r\n\"it has the rich tone and coloring and heart-reaching pathos and\r\ntenderness of the fine old ballads of the early days of English\r\nliterature.\" Miss Carey is passing the winter in New-York, where a poem\r\nby her is in press, which one of the most eminent and time-honored\r\nliterary men in America has declared to be, in all the best elements of\r\npoetry, decidedly superior to any work yet published from the hand of a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMRS. THERESE ADOLPHINE LOUISE ROBINSON, the wife of the distinguished\r\nProfessor and traveller, is best known in the literary world under the\r\nname of _Talvi_, and is indisputably one of the most prominent of the\r\nfew profoundly learned and intellectual women of the age. She is the\r\ndaughter of the German savan, L. H. Jacob, who was long a Professor at\r\nHalle, where she was born on the 26th of January, 1797. In 1806, her\r\nfather was called to a professorship at the Russian University of\r\nCharkow. Here the family remained for five years, and the daughter,\r\nthough deprived of the advantages of a regular education, laid the\r\nfoundation of that acquaintance with the Slavonic languages and\r\nliterature, which she has since so profitably and honorably cultivated.\r\nDuring this time she wrote her first poems, songs full of the girl's\r\nlonging for her German home, which the strange half Asiatic environment\r\nof Southern Russia rendered by contrast only dearer and more attractive.\r\nIn 1811 her father was transferred to St. Petersburg, and there her\r\nstudies were necessarily confined to the modern languages. But her own\r\nindustry was intense and incessant; she devoted a great deal of time to\r\nhistorical reading, and privately cultivated her poetic talent. Her mind\r\npursued the same direction, when, in 1816, her father returned to Halle,\r\nwhere she first made herself mistress of the Latin. Though her friends\r\nbeset her to give some of her productions to the public, she long\r\nresisted. Meanwhile she wrote several tales, which were published at\r\nHalle in 1825, under the title of _Psyche_, with Talvi as the name of\r\nthe author. This pseudonym is composed of the initials of Mrs.\r\nRobinson's maiden name. In 1822, she translated Walter Scott's\r\n_Covenanters_ and _Black Dwarf_, under the name of Ernst Berthold. About\r\nthis time there fell into her hands a review, by Jacob Grimm, of the\r\ncollection of Servian popular songs, published by Mark Stephanowich.\r\nThis increased her interest in that literature to such a degree, that\r\nshe determined to learn the Servian language. Hence arose the\r\ntranslation of _Popular Songs of the Servians_, which, with the aid of\r\nsome Servian friends, she brought out at Halle, in 1825-6, in two\r\nvolumes. In 1828, she became the wife of Professor Robinson, and after a\r\nlong journey with him in different parts of the old world, came to\r\nAmerica. Here she was for some time engaged in the study of the\r\naboriginal languages, and prepared a translation into German of\r\nPickering's Work on the Indian tongues of North America, which was\r\npublished at Leipzic, in 1834. At the same time, she wrote in English a\r\nwork entitled _Historical View of the Slavic Languages_, which was\r\npublished in this country, in 1834, and translated into German, by Karl\r\nvon Olberg, in 1837. This work gives evidence of most remarkable\r\nliterary attainments. In 1837 she again visited Europe with her husband\r\nand children, and remained in Germany till 1840. During this time she\r\nwrote and published at Leipzic, in German, an _Attempt at a Historical\r\nCharacterization of the Popular Songs of the Germanic Nations, with a\r\nReview of the Songs of the extra-European Races_. This is a work of a\r\nmost comprehensive character, and fills up a deficiency which was\r\nconstantly becoming more apparent, in the direction opened by Herder. It\r\nevinces an unprejudiced and catholic mind, a just, poetic, sensible,\r\nclear and secure understanding, as well as the most extensive and\r\nthorough acquirements. Before her return to America she also published,\r\nin German, a small work on _The Falseness of the Songs of Ossian_. An\r\narticle from her pen, entitled _From the History of the First\r\nSettlements in the United States_, published in 1845 in Rumei's\r\n_Historiches Taschenbuch_, is also worthy of notice. In 1847 she brought\r\nout at Leipzic, a historical work on the _Colonization of New England_,\r\nwhich has received the deserved applause of all the German critics, and\r\nwhich abundantly merits a translation into English. An elaborate\r\nreviewal of it appeared lately in the \"Bibliotheca Sacra,\" in which\r\njustice was rendered to its character for research and judicious\r\nhandling. In 1849 she published in New-York, with a preface by Dr.\r\nRobinson, a _Historical Review of the Languages and Literature of the\r\nSlavic Nations; with a Sketch of their Popular Poetry_. It is in one\r\nvolume, from the press of Mr. Putnam, and it has been generally admitted\r\nthat there is not in any language so complete and attractive an epitome\r\nof the literature and various idioms of the great Sclavonic Nations,\r\nnorth and south. Last year Mrs. Robinson gave to the world (through the\r\nAppletons) a novel, entitled _Heloise_, in which there are admirable\r\npictures of social life in one of the minor capitals of Germany, and a\r\nvery able one of the administration of the Russian government in the\r\nCaucasian provinces, and of the nature of Caucasian warfare. The last\r\nwork (just published by the same house), is _Life's Discipline, a Tale\r\nof the Civil Wars of Hungary_. As a tale it is to us more interesting\r\nthan _Heloise_, and it has no less freshness of incident, scenery and\r\ncharacter. Though Mrs. Robinson's distinction is for scholarship and\r\njudgment, rather than for invention, these works entitle her to a very\r\nhigh rank among the female novel writers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMRS. H. C. KNIGHT (we believe of Portsmouth in New-Hampshire) has just\r\ngiven to the public a very interesting \"New Memoir of Hannah More, or\r\nLife in Hall and Cottage.\" It is a book of genuine merit, displaying in\r\na pleasing style the most striking scenes in the history of one of the\r\nnoblest of the women of England.

HACKETT, of the Trenton Theological Institution, has in\r\npress a \"Philological and Exegetical Commentary on the Acts of the\r\nApostles,\" which will be published in the spring. It will embrace\r\nvarious critical discussions in an appendix.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMADAME ANITA GEORGE, the authoress of the very clever books entitled\r\n\"Memoirs of the Queens of Spain\" (recently published by Baker &\r\nScribner), is not, as some suppose, an American, though she began and\r\nhas thus far advanced upon her literary life in this country. She is a\r\nnative of Spain, and is the daughter of a French gentleman--an officer\r\nof the Empire--who married there. Her early life was passed in Cuba,\r\nwhere her father settled when she was about three years of age. In her\r\nseventeenth year she was married to Mr. George, who is an Englishman.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. FENIMORE COOPER published his Life of Commodore Perry, which\r\nthe sober second thought of the people endorses as entirely candid and\r\njust, we remember that it was urged by the Philadelphia critics (who\r\nconstitute a class, as much as the Philadelphia lawyers do), that even\r\nif every thing he advanced were _true_, Mr. Cooper had no right to\r\ndisregard the \"settled and satisfactory opinions of the country upon the\r\nsubject.\" We could never so appreciate as perfectly to admit the truth\r\nof the canon in criticism here involved, and to this day we cannot help\r\nagreeing with Gibbon, that \"Truth is the first virtue of history.\" Mrs.\r\nGeorge seems to concur with Gibbon and Cooper, and disregarding the\r\npoetry and romance woven about the name of Isabella the Catholic, has\r\npainted her according to the documents, which by no means warranted the\r\ncommon good report of her.\r\n\r\nQueen Isabella, according to Mrs. George, owes to some agreeable\r\nqualities, but most of all to her patronage of Columbus, oblivion of\r\nremarkable faults, which were prolific of evil to Spain. She escaped at\r\nthe expense of her husband Ferdinand, who has been charged with her sins\r\nas well as his own. She was not a person to yield to any one where her\r\npower and rights were in question, so that in all matters concerning\r\nhome policy, she is at least entitled to an equal share of the\r\ndiscredit; and in the establishment of the Inquisition, and the\r\npersecution of the Jews and Moors, she stands alone. Ferdinand was\r\nalways disposed to put his religion behind his interest, and was urged\r\nby his wife into measures of which he disapproved; sometimes, indeed,\r\nshe ordered or permitted persecutions of which he was altogether\r\nignorant. Beside the wickedness of these things, their impolicy was not\r\nless conspicuous. The oppression of the Moors, and the expulsion of both\r\nMoors and Jews, destroyed the mechanical and commercial industry of\r\nSpain; the overthrow of the feudal power and privileges of the nobility,\r\nand the establishment of despotism in the crown, checked the growth of\r\ncivil freedom, as the introduction of the Inquisition induced religious\r\nbigotry, and withered mental independence and intellectual cultivation.\r\nNor is Mrs. George disposed to allow weight to the excuse, urged in\r\nfavor of Isabella upon such facts as undeniably tell against her. The\r\nSpaniards of the age, she says, were not so bigoted; the Kings of\r\nAragon, supported by their subjects, had set the Popes at defiance; the\r\nCortes of Aragon and of Valencia resisted the introduction of the\r\nInquisition; some of the clergy, with Fray Francisco de Talavera\r\nArchbishop of Granada at their head, were opposed to all persecution;\r\neven the Pope remonstrated against some wholesale slaughter; and when\r\npersecution had provoked an insurrection, Ferdinand himself was wroth.\r\nNor does the biographer even see an excuse in the Queen's conscience.\r\nWhen religion or churchmen stood in the way of her power or interests,\r\nthey were blown aside. There is in these conclusions, something of the\r\nwoman and of the Spaniard, anxious to excuse in any way the historical\r\ndegradation and present weakness of Spain. If the Spaniards were really\r\nenterprising and industrious, there seems no reason why they might not\r\nhave engaged in commerce, agriculture, and the useful arts, although the\r\nJews and Moors were expelled: the Jews were ousted from England long\r\nbefore they were driven from Spain, yet the English got on in the\r\nabsence of the house of Israel. The destruction of the enormous power of\r\nthe nobility was absolutely necessary, not only to the establishment of\r\norder, but almost to the existence of society itself. It could only be\r\nbrought about by throwing the power of the common people into the scale\r\nof the crown; and so far as Ferdinand and Isabella were concerned, it\r\nseems to have been a wise and politic measure. The real despotism of the\r\ncrown was established by Charles the Fifth, and he might not have been\r\nable to effect it, had he been only King of Spain. For the religious\r\ntyranny, cruelty, and want of faith of Isabella in violating\r\nstipulations, Mrs. George is sparing in the quotation of authorities,\r\nand she often rather asserts than narrates in the account of facts that\r\nwould prove the case. A strict analysis might also show that temporal\r\npower was the object aimed at, and religion a disguise for ambition. We\r\nthink, however, that the case of relentless and cruel persecution is\r\nestablished against Isabella the Catholic; and that it was aggravated by\r\nthe power which the priesthood exercised over her mind in things\r\nindifferent or which agreed with her inclination. In the graces of\r\nperson and manner, and in suavity of temper towards her own party, or\r\nthose whom she wished to gain, Isabella of Castile far excelled her\r\ngranddaughter Mary of England. In tenacity of purpose, in obstinacy, and\r\nin indifference to the misery arising from their orders, it is possible\r\nthey were more alike than the world has supposed. And Isabella might\r\nhave had a similar cognomen, had not the Spaniards continued as bloody\r\nas her age and as bigoted as herself.\r\n\r\nThe style of Mrs. George is in the main very good; but occasional\r\ndefects in diction and in the structure of sentences, are matters of\r\ncourse in a woman who writes in a foreign language. There are some\r\npoints in the Queen's history passed over too lightly, and the\r\nnarrative is not always continuous. Isabella's relations with Columbus,\r\nare barely noticed, on the ground that they had already been so largely\r\nillustrated by Irving and Prescott. Miss Pardoe, who has edited an\r\nEnglish impression of the book, has supplied its most obvious defects\r\ninduced by this consideration.\r\n\r\nMrs. George has just left this country for Madrid, and we have reasons\r\nfor believing that she will devote the remainder of her life to\r\nliterature. She has in contemplation two works, both relating to Spain,\r\nwhich can hardly fail under her spirited and ingenious treatment of\r\nbeing eminently attractive. Since she is no longer in America, we may\r\ngratify curiosity by remarking that she is some years under thirty, and\r\nis one of the most beautiful and brilliantly-talking women of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE are gratified to learn that there is a prospect of the appearance of\r\nthe Memoirs and Inedited Works of our late eminent countryman HENRY\r\nWHEATON, the ablest and faithfulest and worst-used diplomatic servant of\r\nthe United States in the present century. The last time this great man\r\nvisited New-York he passed several hours in our study, and we remember\r\nthat he said then that his Letters to the Secretary of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitute, his various Tracts, Reviews, Historical Essays, &c., which he\r\nwould wish to collect, would make some three or four volumes as large as\r\nhis work on \"The Law of Nations.\" He had also nearly or quite finished a\r\nnew work on the History of the Northmen, being a translation and\r\nimprovement of his _Histoire des Peuples du Nord_, published in Paris,\r\nwhich was an extension of the volume he contributed originally to the\r\nFamily Library, in 1831, upon the same subject. This important work was\r\nadvertised, we believe, before the death of Mr. Wheaton, to be published\r\nin two octavos, by the Appletons, but it has not yet been printed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nR. R. MADDEN'S \"Infirmities of Genius,\" a very pleasant book, is in the\r\npress of Mr. J. S. Redfield. Madden is an Irishman, and he first became\r\nknown to the public by his \"Travels in Turkey,\" published about\r\ntwenty-five years ago. The \"Infirmities of Genius\" appeared in 1833, and\r\ntwo American editions of the work have heretofore been printed. In 1835\r\nMr. Madden came to the United States, and in 1836-7-8-9, he filled the\r\noffice of Superintendent of Liberated Africans, and Commissioner of\r\nArbitration in the Mixed Court of Justice at Havana. His various\r\nexperiences and observations, during eight years of official and private\r\nlife in America, the West Indies, and Africa, led to the composition of\r\nseveral tracts on the slave-trade, and a volume printed we think some\r\ntwo years ago on \"the Island of Cuba, its Resources, Progress, and\r\nProspects.\" The \"Infirmities of Genius\" is, in a literary point of view,\r\nhis best production; and it is likely to retain a place among the\r\ncontributions of the age to standard English literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE REV. E. H. CHAPIN, whose effective elocution and brilliant rhetoric\r\nattract crowds to his ordinary discourses at the Universalist Church in\r\nMurray-street, has in the press of Mr. J. S. Redfield, a volume upon\r\n\"Womanhood, Illustrated by the Women of the New Testament\"--not treating\r\nof these characters in the offensive style of the small rhetoricians,\r\nbut rather in that of Emerson's Representative Men, presenting Martha as\r\na type of the women of society, &c. We believe we have not before\r\nreferred in these pages to the fact, that Mr. Chapin was commonly\r\nregarded as by far the finest orator in the recent Peace Congress at\r\nFrankfort, in which were a large number of men from several nations\r\neminent for eloquence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY OF IMPORTANT HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS, according to a Chicago\r\npaper, has recently been made among the manuscripts which were saved\r\nfrom the pillage of the Jesuits' College in Quebec. \"It is well known by\r\nthose familiar with the resources of early American history, that the\r\npublication of the Jesuit Relations, which furnish so much of interest\r\nin regard to the discovery and early exploration of the region bordering\r\non our northern lakes, was discontinued after the year 1672. Some were\r\nknown to have been written, but the manuscripts were supposed to be\r\nlost. The Relations from 1672 to 1679 inclusive, have lately been\r\ndiscovered, and among them a manuscript containing a full account of the\r\nvoyages of Father Marquette, and of the discovery by him of the\r\nMississippi river. It was undoubtedly this manuscript which furnished\r\nThevenot the text of his publication in 1687, of 'The voyages and\r\ndiscoveries of Father Marquette and of the Sieur Joliet.' The latter\r\nkept a journal and drew a map of their route, but his canoe was upset in\r\nthe falls of St. Louis, as he was descending the St. Lawrence in sight\r\nof Montreal, and he lost them with the rest of his effects. What\r\nincreases the value of the present discovery is, that the original\r\nnarrative goes much more into detail than the one published by Thevenot.\r\nThe motive which prompted and the preparations which were made for the\r\nexpedition are fully described, and no difficulty is found in tracing\r\nits route. There is also among the papers an autograph journal by\r\nMarquette, of his last voyage from the 25th of October, 1674, to the 6th\r\nof April, 1675, a month before his singular death, which occurred on the\r\neastern shore of Lake Michigan. Also, a chart of the Mississippi drawn\r\nby himself, illustrating his travels. The one annexed to Thevenot's\r\naccount, above referred to, a copy of which is contained in the third\r\nvolume of Bancroft's History of the United States, is manifestly\r\nincorrect, as there is a variance between the route of the Jesuit as\r\ntraced on his map, and that detailed in his text. The manuscript chart\r\nnow rescued from oblivion, reconciles all discrepancies, and constitutes\r\na most interesting historical relic.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMONG the publications of the past month, _A copious and critical\r\nLatin-English Lexicon_, royal octavo, pp. 1663, from the press of the\r\nHarpers, is especially deserving of praise. We congratulate Professors\r\nAndrews and Turner on the honorable close to their long and arduous\r\nlabors. They have earned thanks of all beginning students and riper\r\nscholars in the Latin tongue. These, and the advancement of sound\r\nlearning, are the only adequate rewards for labors so untiring and long\r\ncontinued; so wearisome and beneficial. The highest and only just praise\r\nof this admirable volume, would be given by a plain statement of its\r\nmerits, but these are too extensive and varied to be even catalogued\r\nwithin brief limits--we can only touch upon a few of them. For a year\r\npast we have had opportunity and occasion to examine parts of the work\r\nas it was going on to completion, and to compare it with others of\r\nsimilar design. We speak then advisedly when we say that it far\r\nsurpasses any such Lexicon hitherto in use among us, and should\r\nsupersede them all. Since the works of Forcellini, and Facciolati, and\r\nGesner, very great advances have been made in all departments of\r\nclassical Philology; many of the best results of these advances were\r\nembodied in Freund's great Lexicon, the first volume of which was\r\npublished in 1834. But since then, and even since 1845, the date of the\r\nlast volume, the thirst for antiquarian research has slaked itself at\r\nnewly discovered sources. The present editors, to a discriminating\r\nselection from all that the zeal and activity of others have gathered,\r\nup to the latest time, have added valuable knowledge from their own\r\nvaried stores, and at last furnished to American students a work\r\nsuperior in its kind to any that has preceded it here or abroad. It\r\ncombines in a remarkable degree the copiousness of a Thesaurus with the\r\nbrevity and convenience for ready reference of a school-dictionary.\r\nCitations abundantly sufficient to meet the wants of ordinary readers\r\nare given in full, while distinct references guide the more exacting\r\nscholar over a much wider field of original authority. In this way space\r\nis economized, and the book is made cheap without a sacrifice of\r\nlearning. Its first general merit is its singular correctness. In a\r\nverification of the almost numberless passages quoted, and a correction\r\nof time-honored blunders, committed by subordinates, but sanctioned by\r\nnames of great writers employing them; in a distrust of authority at\r\nsecond-hand, and persistent fidelity to the cause of learning, we\r\nrecognize the diligence of Prof. W. W. Turner. Those who have never\r\ntried this kind of work have but an inadequate idea of its demands on\r\nthe brain, and on the conscience too. _Reading through_ a dictionary is\r\nan after-dinner pastime in comparison. The vocabulary is more extended\r\nthan in other lexicons. But the peculiar and highest merit of this work\r\nappears in definitions, remarkable for clearness, fulness, and\r\ndistinction of the subtle shades of meaning. Colloquial, technical, and\r\nother special uses of words, here receive their share of attention, and\r\nare felicitously rendered or illustrated by corresponding English terms.\r\nThe arrangement is admirable. The words of the vocabulary are\r\ndistinguished by an appropriate type. The etymology, the primitive and\r\nderivative, the general and special, the proper and tropical\r\nsignifications of a word; its meaning before the courts, in the temples,\r\nat the games, among the Roman mob or the Roman exquisites; its\r\nanti-classical, golden-augustan, neo-degenerate or patristic use--all\r\nthis is given in a regular order, by changes of type and an ingenious\r\nsystem of abbreviations, so that the whole origin, history, value and\r\napplication of any Latin word may be taken in, almost at a glance. The\r\namount of archaeological learning--compressed indeed but never obscured\r\nby abridgment--scattered through these pages is immense. Finally there\r\nis an appendix, containing the XII. Tables, and other specimens of\r\nArchaic Latin; and another, giving a list of Italian and French words,\r\nvaried by euphonic changes from the Latin origin. There are also a\r\ntranslation of Freund's original preface by Prof. Woolsey, and a modest\r\npreface by Prof. Andrews, the editor in chief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE REV.

Surveying the vast chain of mountains, which rises\r\nmidway between the oceans, a poetical Jesuit said, \"They are in labor\r\nwith nations.\" Mr. Phillips might easily have fancied, as he pursued his\r\nsummer journey through the wilderness from Oregon and California, among\r\nregions more lovely and magnificent than any that were seen by the\r\nfathers of art, that of such sights should be born nobler works than\r\nhave yet been addressed to the senses or to the imagination; and it is\r\nnot improbable that many a London, and Moscow, and Berlin, and Paris,\r\nwill some time have their busy populations, where now the ground is\r\nhidden by the falling leaves of forests, and trampled by wild horses and\r\nbuffaloes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nONE of the most eminent of the living English historians, lately\r\ndiscovered, as he thought, that \"Old Sam Adams\" was a _defaulter_, and\r\nthat he was opposed to Washington; and not choosing to wait until the\r\nexposure could be made in his forthcoming work, he communicated it to a\r\nvery distinguished American, by letter. Now this is all sheer nonsense.\r\nIt is not necessary to deny the justice of the suspicion that Samuel\r\nAdams was unfriendly to Washington, and all the facts as to his conduct\r\nas collector for his Majesty's port of Boston, are perfectly familiar to\r\nour historical students. He did not indeed pay into the exchequer every\r\nshilling with which he was _charged_: well understood circumstances\r\nprevented the _collection_ of a large amount of duties; but whatever he\r\nreceived was paid over, and his accounts were squared to a farthing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

This proves\r\nthat the popularity of Willis is genuine and _permanent_. In his way, he\r\nis unrivalled,--in any way, he has among the authors of this country but\r\nsome half dozen peers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. G.

The authoress of \"Mary\r\nBarton\" published another, under the title of \"Moreland Cottage,\" not,\r\nlike her former work, a story of social wrong, but of gentle domestic\r\nlife. At the same time it is, if we may judge by extracts in the papers,\r\nmarked by the admirable peculiarities of her writing.

We have\r\nglanced over a few sheets of it, and are confident that if success\r\ndepends upon quality, it will prove one of the most successful books yet\r\npublished, upon a region which is illustrated by a larger amount of\r\nliterature than any other in the world.

It is a hand-book of facts, so perspicuously classified and\r\narranged, as to suit the necessities of persons of every degree of\r\nintelligence, and so full, upon almost every sort of subjects, as to\r\nserve the purposes of a universal manual.

HILDRETH'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, being\r\nthe first volume of the post-revolutionary history, will be published\r\nimmediately, we believe, by the Harpers. We look for an exceedingly\r\ninteresting book. Of the earlier volumes of the History, the London\r\n_Spectator_ observes:--\r\n\r\n     \"The distinguishing literary characteristic of this history\r\n     is a careful succinctness. The convenience of a summary\r\n     notice of the gradual discovery of America, and the\r\n     necessity of singly narrating the foundation of each\r\n     separate colony, render any substantial novelty of plan in a\r\n     history of the United States impossible, except upon some\r\n     scheme where fitness should be sacrificed to fanciful\r\n     strangeness. Mr. Hildreth has judiciously refrained from\r\n     attempting any thing of the kind: but perhaps he has pushed\r\n     the mere chronological arrangement to an excess, and given\r\n     undue prominence to the discoveries and settlement of North\r\n     America by foreigners, in proportion to the scale of his\r\n     work. In the execution, Mr. Hildreth has carefully read and\r\n     as carefully digested his various authorities, and presented\r\n     the results of his studies succinctly, closely, and\r\n     comprehensively. In many cases the compendious style is apt\r\n     to fall into a vague generality, or the pith of the matter\r\n     is liable to be missed; but such is not the case with Mr.\r\n     Hildreth's. He states all that he sees, though he would see\r\n     more if he possessed a loftier and imaginative mind. We know\r\n     not his profession, but there is something lawyerlike in his\r\n     work. One subject seems the same to him as another: it is\r\n     not so much that he wants variety of power; as that he does\r\n     not seem to feel the variety in nature. His book is as much\r\n     a digest as a history. The parts in which Mr. Hildreth\r\n     succeeds best are those that relate to the social and\r\n     religious opinions and practices of the colonists. In fact,\r\n     it is as a social history that it possesses character and\r\n     value. The author's quiet unimpassioned style presents the\r\n     strange peculiarities that obtained among the New England\r\n     colonists till within little more than a generation of the\r\n     Revolutionary war, and some traces of which still remain.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"THE MEMORIAL, _written by friends of the late Mrs. Osgood_,\" to which\r\nwe have heretofore referred in these pages, is the most beautiful book\r\npublished in America during the season, and as an original literary\r\nmiscellany it surpasses any volume that ever appeared in the English\r\nlanguage. The _Albion_ says of it:\r\n\r\n     \"Seldom has a more graceful compliment been paid to the\r\n     memory of departed worth, than is exhibited in this handsome\r\n     volume, which is edited by Mrs. Mary E. Hewitt. It\r\n     originated at a chance meeting of a literary coterie, soon\r\n     after the death of the gifted and amiable woman in whose\r\n     honor it has been put together. When the conversation turned\r\n     upon the many claims which she possessed on the affections\r\n     and the esteem of those present, it was resolved that a\r\n     souvenir volume should be made up from their voluntary\r\n     contributions, and that the profits arising from the sale\r\n     should be devoted to erecting a monument over her grave, in\r\n     the Cemetery of Mount Auburn, near Boston. Many writers of\r\n     distinguished merit have engraved their names upon this\r\n     preparatory tablet, not all being numbered amongst her\r\n     friends and acquaintances, but all appreciating the many\r\n     virtues of the deceased lady, and the kindly motives of her\r\n     sorrowing friends. The table of contents shows indeed such a\r\n     list of names as should insure the speedy attainment of the\r\n     object in view. We can but mention half-a-dozen--Hawthorne,\r\n     Willis, G. P. R. James, the Bishop of Jamaica, John Neal,\r\n     Stoddard, Boker, G. P. Morris and Bayard Taylor, amongst the\r\n     men, and Miss Lynch, Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Oaksmith, Mrs.\r\n     Sigourney, and the Editress to represent the sisterhood of\r\n     authorship. An admirable likeness of Mrs. Osgood, from a\r\n     portrait by her husband, serves as a frontispiece, and, with\r\n     some charming vignettes on steel and other illustrations,\r\n     enhances the value of this choice and creditable book.\"\r\n     (Putnam, publisher.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFORTUNE-TELLING is as much in vogue as ever in Paris. A book, which is\r\nsaid to have caused much observation, appeared there lately, which is\r\nthus described in the correspondence of the London _Literary Gazette_:--\r\n\r\n     \"It consists of extracts from the voluminous writings of a\r\n     poor _gentilhomme_ of Brittany, during a period of upwards\r\n     of sixty years, and each extract is a prediction of some one\r\n     of the great political convulsions which have occurred in\r\n     this country during that time. Never was there a more\r\n     correct _Vates_; but Cassandra herself was not more\r\n     disregarded than he. The downfall and execution of Louis\r\n     XVI., the horrors of the Terror, the power and overthrow of\r\n     Napoleon, the revolution of 1830, and the republic of 1848,\r\n     were all predicted years before they came to pass; but the\r\n     poor prophet was set down as a madman by all his literary\r\n     contemporaries, and during his lifetime not a single\r\n     newspaper would consent to say any thing about his\r\n     predictions. What is the most singular thing of all is, that\r\n     he foretold (years ago, remember--when Louis Philippe was at\r\n     the height of his power), that the proclamation of the\r\n     republic would lead to the domination of a member of\r\n     Napoleon's family, and so it has; though if any one only six\r\n     months before Louis Napoleon's election had predicted the\r\n     same thing, he would certainly have been set down as a\r\n     lunatic. In consequence of this extraordinary foresight of\r\n     our prophet, people have looked with no little concern to\r\n     what he says for the future. And alas! they have met with\r\n     nothing very consolatory. We are, it seems, on the brink of\r\n     a fearful social crisis, the consequence of which will be\r\n     the complete destruction of European society as at present\r\n     constituted; and this destruction is only to be effected by\r\n     the shedding of rivers of blood, and the weeping of oceans\r\n     of tears!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWE are pleased to perceive that the writings of Hartley Coleridge are\r\nsoon to be collected and suitably published.

And _The Literary Veteran_,\r\nincluding sketches and anecdotes of the most distinguished literary\r\ncharacters, from 1794 to 1849, by R. P. Gilles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE REV. HENRY T. CHEEVER has just published a volume entitled \"The\r\nIsland World of the Pacific,\" (Harpers,) which for various personal\r\ninterest, fulness and accuracy of information, and right feeling, is to\r\nbe preferred to any book on the subject since the appearance of Cook's\r\nVoyages. We know of no traveller in Polynesia who has had better\r\nopportunities for observation than Mr. Cheever. His abilities as a\r\nwriter were illustrated by \"The Whale and his Captors,\" published two or\r\nthree years ago. The style of the present performance is not at all\r\ninferior, and it is especially commendable for a perspicuous\r\ncompactness. So much misrepresentation of the Sandwich and other Islands\r\nhas appeared lately, that we are glad of an opportunity to commend a\r\nbook so authoritative and satisfactory upon the whole subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. J. MOREAU of Paris, has completed a new version into French of the\r\n_Imitatio Christi_, and has accompanied it with select passages from the\r\nFathers and other pious authors. The same writer has also published\r\nunder the title of _Le Philosophe Inconnu_, an essay on the ideas and\r\nwritings of the celebrated theosophist Saint-Martin. This remarkable\r\nmystic, who in his lifetime was surrounded by so many disciples and\r\nadmirers, is now known only to the curious seekers among the dusty\r\nshelves of libraries. M. Moreau attempts to show that his heresies\r\ncontained a spice of orthodoxy, and this he endeavors to develop for the\r\nbenefit of whom it may concern.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBISHOP ONDERDONK of Pennsylvania is a person of large abilities; he is\r\none of the strongest writers of the Episcopal Church in the country; and\r\nit is unjust that the unfortunate circumstances of his ecclesiastical\r\nposition should prevent the recognition of his merits as a scholar and\r\ndialectician. We are pleased, therefore, that his friends have taken\r\nmeasures for the publication of a collection of his _Theological Works_,\r\nincluding sermons and Episcopal charges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEW GERMAN POEMS.--Louise von Ploennies has published two new books of\r\npoetry, one under the title of _Neue Gedichte_ (New Poems), the other\r\n_Oskar und Giaunetta_. They are spoken of as superior to her former\r\nproductions, and worthy of a most honorable place among the productions\r\nof German poetesses. Oscar and Giaunetta is a love story in verse. The\r\npurpose of the writer is to exhibit the masculine and feminine\r\nprinciples, Thought and Beauty, as mutually completing each other in the\r\npassion of love. The _Monates-Maehrchen_ (Tales of the Month), by Gustar\r\nvon Mayem, are poems of another sort. Instead of sentimentality, the\r\nstock in trade of this writer is patriotism and politics. His inspiring\r\nthought is the unity of Germany and the national greatness which must\r\nresult therefrom. Unfortunately this thought does not find so welcome a\r\nreception with statesmen as with poets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA PRODUCTION of the most indisputable German plodding and erudition is\r\nthe _Satzungen und Gebraeuche des talmudisch-rabbinischen Judenthums_, by\r\nDr. I. F. Schroeder, lately issued at Bremen. It gives a complete account\r\nof the religious notions, doctrines, and usages of the Jews. To\r\ntheologians it is of high value for the light which it casts upon the\r\nformation and institutions of the Christian Church. The author has\r\nemployed in its composition the writings of every sect, and has\r\ncondensed in it the result of a thorough study of the entire literature\r\nrelating to the Old Testament and the rabbinical writings. He writes\r\nwith the greatest impartiality, and in the interest of no particular\r\ncreed or tendency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. ARAGO said lately in the Academy of Sciences, upon the suggestion of\r\nsome possibilities in aerostation, that a long time since the whole\r\nsubject had been treated in a masterly manner by Mousnier, a celebrated\r\nmember of the Academy of Sciences. His treatise had remained in\r\nmanuscript in the public library of Metz, and if it should be committed\r\nto the press, it would prove to those who think they have discovered new\r\nmethods of aerial locomotion, that what is plausible and rational in\r\ntheir ideas was already perfectly well known, expounded and appreciated,\r\nin the last century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE government of Naples constantly increases its list of prohibited\r\nbooks. Among the works now excluded, Humboldt's Cosmos, Shakspeare,\r\nGoldsmith, Heeren's Historical Treatises, Ovid, Lucian, Lucretius,\r\nSophocles, Suetonius, Paul de Kock, Victor Hugo, E. Girardin, G. Sand,\r\nLamartine, Valery's L'Italie, Goethe, Schiller, Thiers, A. Dumas,\r\nMoliere, all the German philosophers, and Henry Stephens's Greek\r\nDictionary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ABBE LACORDAIRE has published an introduction to a work entitled _Le\r\nMonde Occulte_--an exposition of the mysteries of magnetism, by means of\r\nsomnambulism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA BOOK which contains some excellent sketches relative to MAZZINI and\r\nthe Roman Republic, has been published at Bremen, with the title, _Des\r\nRepublikaner's Schwerdfahrt_, (The Republican's Sword-Pilgrimage). The\r\nauthor is a German, Ernst Hang, who held a high post in the Roman army.\r\nHe is now in Asia Minor, where his work was written. It is eloquent\r\nsometimes, and entertaining and sensible always. His remarks on the\r\nmutual relations of Germany and Italy, are admitted to be sound and\r\njudicious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HON. CHARLES A. MURRAY, author of a volume of Travels in America,\r\nand of three or four novels, is now the British Consul-General in Egypt,\r\nand with his newly-married wife was to depart for Alexandria, to resume\r\nhis consular duties, towards the close of January.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE first volume of a most valuable and interesting work has just made\r\nits appearance at Frankfort-on-the-Main. It is called _Geschichte der\r\nFrauen_ (History of Woman), and is from the pen of G. Jung. The volume\r\nnow issued contains the history of the oppression of woman, and her\r\ngradual self-emancipation down to the Christian era. It is written with\r\ngreat talent, and comprehensive learning, but without pedantry. The\r\nauthor believes that the emancipation of woman is not yet completed, and\r\nshe has a right to a free development of her faculties, and a perfectly\r\nindependent position in society. Two more volumes will complete the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fine Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD WAGNER, well known as an artist, has brought out at Leipzic a\r\nbook called _Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft_ (Art in the Future), which\r\nexcites a good deal of attention, and is soundly assailed by those who\r\ndislike it. Wagner adopts the philosophical ideas of Feuerbach, and\r\ntreats his subject from that stand-point. Into modern art he pitches\r\nwith all the force of a genuine iconoclast. He says it is a sexless,\r\nsterile product of dreams, not art, but merely manner, &c. With him art\r\nmust come out of the people, and be the apotheosis of the people. The\r\npeople are immortal and ever young. With the poets and novel-writers of\r\nthe day, Wagner has no more patience than with the artists. They are, he\r\nthinks, dilettanti, sentimentalists, who coquet with the misery of the\r\nmasses, in order to serve the same up well spiced and warmed to their\r\nluxurious and fashionable readers. The ideal and absolute in art he\r\nfinds in the drama, which is the sum and type of all other artistic\r\ncreations. But no drama yet produced satisfies him, and he tells the\r\nreasons why without hesitation. Those who wish to be entertained and set\r\nthinking by an author who is in earnest even when most paradoxical, may\r\nlook at Wagner's book with advantage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHORWALDSEN.--The Danish Government some time since sent Mr. Thiele, a\r\ncompetent person, to Rome, for the purpose of collecting every thing\r\nthat could be obtained toward a history of the life and works of this\r\nillustrious sculptor, whose early life is so obscure that even the date\r\nand place of his birth are unknown, as well as the employment he made of\r\nthe first years that he was in Italy. Mr. Thiele has found a number of\r\ncasks in the cellars of the Tomati Palace at Rome, filled with letters,\r\naddressed to Thorwaldsen, and among them a long and constant\r\ncorrespondence between him and his mother, who lived part of the time in\r\nDenmark and part of the time in Iceland, her native country. It seems\r\nthat Thorwaldsen had the habit of preserving his papers, even to the\r\nmost trifling, by flinging them confusedly into a cedar box in his room;\r\nwhen that was full they were emptied into the casks where they have now\r\nbeen found; these casks were not noticed when all the other contents of\r\nthe palace were removed to Copenhagen. Whatever is interesting in these\r\npapers will, of course, be published. Mr. Thiele has also discovered in\r\nthe same cellar the model of a bas-relief by the same great artist,\r\nrepresenting the Muses dancing by Helicon. It will be added to the\r\ncollection of his works at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE artist HEIDEL has published at Berlin a series of Eight\r\nIllustrations to Goethe's Iphigenia. He aims in them to preserve unmixed\r\nthe spirit of antique art, and thus to prove that the Germans are the\r\ntrue successors of the Greeks. The subjects of his designs are:--The\r\nFall of Tantalus; the Departure of Agamemnon; the Sacrifice of\r\nIphigenia; the Death of Agamemnon; the Death of Clytemnestrae; the Flight\r\nof Orestes; the Meeting of Orestes and Iphigenia; and the Return of\r\nIphigenia. The designs are praised by the German critics. They say that\r\nin beholding the Flight of Orestes, pursued by the Furies, who dare not\r\nenter the sacred temple of Apollo where he seeks refuge, one imagines\r\nthat he hears the fearful chanting of a chorus of AEschylus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA NEW ART called _Metallography_ has been discovered by Nicholas Zack, a\r\nlithographer at Munich, by means of which designs that have hitherto\r\nbeen engraved on wood can be put directly upon metal, and in such a\r\nmanner as to be printed from. The plate is prepared beforehand, and the\r\nartist draws his design upon it with a pencil or a needle. Without any\r\nfurther labor, by means of the preparation alone, the plate will be\r\nready for printing. Worn-out plates may be restored with very little\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA BOOKSELLER of Munich has published Albert Duerer's sketches from the\r\nprayer-book of Emperor Maximilian I., with the original text, colored\r\ninitials, and an introduction. Price eight thalers, about $6,00.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMORITZ RUGENDAS, a German artist, who has lately spent a considerable\r\ntime in Mexico and the countries of South America, is now engaged at\r\nMunich, in arranging the pictures for which his journeys in those\r\ncountries furnished him the materials. A work of such magnitude has\r\nnever before been undertaken by any artist. He intends to treat each\r\ncountry in a continuous series of views. The Mexican series is now\r\nnearly completed, consisting of about 100 landscapes, in oil. It begins\r\nwith Vera Cruz, where the artist landed, and goes through the whole\r\ncountry to the Pacific. First is the coast seen from the sea; next we\r\nbehold the coast with the sea as it appears inland; then we mount to the\r\nplains, noticing the gradual change of the mountain formations, and the\r\nvegetation, with views in every direction from each interesting point;\r\nwe pass through the great plateau, ascend the volcanoes and survey their\r\ncraters, and admire the beauty of the region about the city of Mexico.\r\nFrom the city there are sketches of journeys in every direction, and at\r\nlast we traverse the palm forest of St. Jago, and stand upon the heights\r\nwhence the eye reaches to the Pacific. Every picturesque scene is\r\nfinished with the greatest care and with special regard to the natural\r\nfeatures of the landscape. Buildings and human figures are either\r\navoided altogether or used as merely subordinate. When Mexico is\r\ncompleted, Rugendas will use in a similar manner the sketches he has\r\ntaken in other countries. It is not known whether his pictures will be\r\nengraved or not. They will, we believe, become the property of the Royal\r\nPinakothek, at Munich.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe painters at Vienna have formed an Art-Union, which is succeeding in\r\nits first exhibition, which is now open. Some well-known artists of\r\nGermany have sent pictures. Foltz, of Munich, has a landscape with a\r\nflock of sheep; Zimmerman a landscape with effect of sunlight; Huelner,\r\nof Duesseldorf, a boy reading the Bible to his mother, Vienna. Koeckoeck,\r\nof Holland, has two landscapes. The artists of Vienna have also not been\r\nbackward. Among the names of the exhibitors we notice that of\r\nWaldmueller, who is known in this country for his picture of the Children\r\nleaving School, which was drawn a year since by one of the subscribers\r\nto the International Art-Union, and was regarded as one of the chief\r\nattractions of its collection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe hear from Berlin that KAULBACH has painted in miniature the Four\r\nEvangelists, in a copy of Luther's translation of the New Testament,\r\nwhich is destined for the World's Fair. The book is a folio; the leaves\r\nare of vellum, and the printing is done in Gothic letters and in various\r\ncolored inks by four accomplished masters of calligraphy. These artists\r\nhave also ornamented their work with numerous vignettes. The book is now\r\nbeing exhibited at the Royal Library in Berlin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. PRESCOTT, Mr. Ticknor, and other Boston gentlemen of high\r\ncultivation and artistic taste, have prepared a memorial to Congress\r\nthat POWERS should be commissioned by government to put into marble his\r\nstatue of America. For less than twenty-five thousand dollars,\r\nprobably--for a sum not larger than that which was paid by the\r\ngovernment for the two specimens of commonplace by Mr. Persico, this\r\nadmirable production might be obtained in colossal size for the capitol.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe GERMAN _Arch[=a]ologische Institut_, at Rome, celebrated the\r\nbirth-day of Winckelmann on the 13th of December. Dr. Emil Braun read an\r\nessay on the two chief groups of the frieze of the Parthenon. These\r\ngroups have hitherto been supposed to represent the twelve gods of\r\nOlympus; Dr. Braun attempted to show that they represent, in a double\r\npoint of view, the native heroes of Attica. The physical development of\r\nthe country is expressed in the genealogy of a royal race, beginning\r\nwith Cecrops and his wife Agraulia, continued in Cranaus and Amphictyon,\r\nand finally passing into Erichthonius, the son of Atthis, and foster son\r\nof Pandrosos. The social organization of the state begins with\r\nErechtheus, who is aided by his wife Praxithea, and his daughter Creusa.\r\nHe annexes Eleusis to Athens, the former being here represented by\r\nDemeter and Triptolemus; finally Theseus with his friend Pirithous\r\ncompletes the civil organization of Athens, and establishes it upon a\r\nfirm basis. Essays on subjects connected with antique art and history\r\nwere also read by Dr. L. Schmidt, Dr. H. Brunn, and Dr. W. Heuzen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe paintings of the Chapel of the Virgin in the Church of Notre Dame de\r\nLorette, a vast work, which has hitherto remained unknown to the public,\r\nand which has been interrupted by the recent death of the painter, M.\r\nVictor Orsel, are now attracting attention. M. Perrin, intrusted with\r\nthe execution of a similar chapel in the same edifice, will undertake\r\nthe pious task of terminating the work of a friend, with whom he had\r\nlived on terms of the closest friendship, cemented by a community of\r\nideas and talent. Orsel was making rapid strides towards a great\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had occasion lately to notice in the _International_ the\r\nillustrations of Hood's \"Bridge of Sighs,\" by Mr. Ehninger. This young\r\nartist has just published in a large quarto (through Putnam) a series of\r\nOutline Illustrations of Washington Irving's \"Dolph Heyliger,\" which are\r\nan improvement upon his first performance. Many of the scenes are\r\nadmirably rendered. We believe Mr. Ehninger is now pursuing the study of\r\nart abroad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German sculptor, WOLFF, has added to, his many admirable works a\r\nfigure of _Paris_, which is much praised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHORESS OF \"JANE EYRE,\" AND HER SISTERS.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Bronte has just published in London the literary remains of her\r\nsisters, \"Ellis\" and \"Acton Bell,\" with interesting sketches of their\r\nhistories, including some glimpses of her own. We copy a portion of the\r\nreviewal of the work in the _Athenaeum_:\r\n\r\nThe lifting of that veil which for a while concealed the authorship of\r\n'Jane Eyre' and its sister-novels, excites in us no surprise. It seemed\r\nevident from the first prose pages bearing the signatures of Currer,\r\nEllis, and Acton Bell, that these were _Rosalinds_--or a _Rosalind_--in\r\nmasquerade:--some doubt as to the plurality of persons being engendered\r\nby a certain uniformity of local color and resemblance in choice of\r\nsubject, which might have arisen either from identity, or from joint\r\npeculiarities of situation and of circumstance. It seemed no less\r\nevident that the writers described from personal experience the wild and\r\nrugged scenery of the northern parts of this kingdom; and no assertion\r\nor disproval, no hypothesis or rumor, which obtained circulation after\r\nthe success of 'Jane Eyre,' could shake convictions that had been\r\ngathered out of the books themselves. In similar cases, guessers are too\r\napt to raise plausible arguments on some point of detail,--forgetting\r\nthat this may have been thrown in _ex proposito_ to mislead the\r\nbystander; and hence the most ingenious discoverers become so\r\npertinaciously deluded as to lose eye and ear for those less obvious\r\nindications of general tone of style, color of incident, and form of\r\nfable, on which more phlegmatic persons base measurement and comparison.\r\nWhatever of truth there may or may not be generally in the above\r\nremarks,--certain it is, that in the novels now in question instinct or\r\ndivination directed us aright. In the prefaces and notices before us, we\r\nfind that the Bells were three sisters:--two of whom are no longer\r\namongst the living. The survivor describes their home as--\r\n\r\n     \"A village parsonage, amongst the hills bordering Yorkshire\r\n     and Lancashire. The scenery of these hills is not grand--it\r\n     is not romantic; it is scarcely striking. Long low moors,\r\n     dark with heath, shut in little valleys, where a stream\r\n     waters, here and there, a fringe of stunted copse. Mills and\r\n     scattered cottages chase romance from these valleys; it is\r\n     only higher up, deep in amongst the ridges of the moors,\r\n     that Imagination can find rest for the sole of her foot: and\r\n     even if she finds it there, she must be a solitude-loving\r\n     raven,--no gentle dove. If she demand beauty to inspire her,\r\n     she must bring it inborn: these moors are too stern to yield\r\n     any product so delicate. The eye of the gazer must itself\r\n     brim with a 'purple light,' intense enough to perpetuate the\r\n     brief flower-flush of August on the heather, or the rare\r\n     sunset-smile of June; out of his heart must well the\r\n     freshness that in later spring and early summer brightens\r\n     the bracken, nurtures the moss, and cherishes the starry\r\n     flowers that spangle for a few weeks the pasture of the\r\n     moor-sheep. Unless that light and freshness are innate and\r\n     self-sustained, the drear prospect of a Yorkshire moor will\r\n     be found as barren of poetic as of agricultural interest:\r\n     where the love of wild nature is strong, the locality will\r\n     perhaps be clung to with the more passionate constancy,\r\n     because from the hill-lover's self comes half its charm.\"\r\n\r\nThus much of the scene:--now as to the story of the authorship of these\r\nsingular books:--\r\n\r\n     \"About five years ago, my two sisters and myself, after a\r\n     somewhat prolonged period of separation, found ourselves\r\n     reunited and at home. Resident in a remote district where\r\n     education had made little progress, and where, consequently,\r\n     there was no inducement to seek social intercourse beyond\r\n     our own domestic circle, we were wholly dependent on\r\n     ourselves and each other, on books and study, for the\r\n     enjoyments and occupations of life. * * One day, in the\r\n     autumn of 1845, I accidentally lighted on a MS. volume of\r\n     verse in my sister Emily's handwriting. Of course, I was not\r\n     surprised, knowing that she could and did write verse; I\r\n     looked it over, and something more than surprise seized\r\n     me,--a deep conviction that these were not common effusions,\r\n     nor at all like the poetry women generally write. * *\r\n     Meantime, my younger sister quietly produced some of her own\r\n     compositions, intimating that since Emily's had given me\r\n     pleasure, I might like to look at hers. I could not be a\r\n     partial judge, yet I thought that these verses too had a\r\n     sweet sincere pathos of their own. We had very early\r\n     cherished the dream of one day becoming authors. This dream,\r\n     never relinquished even when distance divided and absorbing\r\n     tasks occupied us, now suddenly acquired strength and\r\n     consistency: it took the character of a resolve. We agreed\r\n     to arrange a small selection of our poems, and, if possible,\r\n     get them printed. Averse to personal publicity, we veiled\r\n     our own names under those of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell;\r\n     the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of\r\n     conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively\r\n     masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women,\r\n     because--without at that time suspecting that our mode of\r\n     writing and thinking was not what is called 'feminine'--we\r\n     had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be\r\n     looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics\r\n     sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of\r\n     personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not\r\n     true praise. The bringing out of our little book was hard\r\n     work. * * Ill-success failed to crush us: the mere effort to\r\n     succeed had given a wonderful zest to existence; it must be\r\n     pursued. We each set to work on a prose tale: Ellis Bell\r\n     produced 'Wuthering Heights,' Acton Bell 'Agnes Grey,' and\r\n     Currer Bell also wrote a narrative in one volume. These MSS.\r\n     were perseveringly obtruded upon various publishers for the\r\n     space of a year and a half; usually, their fate was an\r\n     ignominious and abrupt dismissal. At last 'Wuthering\r\n     Heights' and 'Agnes Grey,' were accepted on terms somewhat\r\n     impoverishing to the two authors.\"\r\n\r\nThe MS. of a one-volume tale by Currer Bell had been thought by Messrs.\r\nSmith & Elder so full of promise, that its writer was asked for a longer\r\nstory in a more saleable form.--\r\n\r\n     \"I was then just completing 'Jane Eyre,' at which I had been\r\n     working while the one-volume tale was plodding its weary\r\n     round in London: in three weeks I sent it off; friendly and\r\n     skillful hands took it in. This was in the commencement of\r\n     September, 1847; it came out before the close of October\r\n     following, while 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Agnes Grey,' my\r\n     sisters' works, which had already been in the press for\r\n     months, still lingered under a different management. They\r\n     appeared at last. Critics failed to do them justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe narrative may be best concluded in the writer's own words.\r\n\r\n     \"Neither Ellis nor Acton allowed herself for one moment to\r\n     sink under want of encouragement; energy nerved the one, and\r\n     endurance upheld the other. They were both prepared to try\r\n     again; I would fain think that hope and the sense of power\r\n     was yet strong within them. But a great change approached:\r\n     affliction came in that shape which to anticipate, is dread;\r\n     to look back on, grief. In the very heat and burden of the\r\n     day, the laborers failed over their work. My sister Emily\r\n     first declined. The details of her illness are deep-branded\r\n     in my memory, but to dwell on them, either in thought or\r\n     narrative, is not in my power. Never in all her life had she\r\n     lingered over any task that lay before her, and she did not\r\n     linger now. She sank rapidly. She made haste to leave us.\r\n     Yet, while physically she perished, mentally she grew\r\n     stronger than we had yet known her. Day by day, when I saw\r\n     with what a front she met suffering, I looked on her with an\r\n     anguish of wonder and love. I have seen nothing like it;\r\n     but, indeed, I have never seen her parallel in any thing.\r\n     Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood\r\n     alone. The awful point was, that, while full of ruth for\r\n     others, on herself she had no pity; the spirit was\r\n     inexorable to the flesh; from the trembling hand, the\r\n     unnerved limbs, the faded eyes, the same service was exacted\r\n     as they had rendered in health. To stand by and witness\r\n     this, and not dare to remonstrate, was a pain no words can\r\n     render. Two cruel months of hope and fear passed painfully\r\n     by, and the day came at last when the terrors and pains of\r\n     death were to be undergone by this treasure, which had grown\r\n     dearer and dearer to our hearts as it wasted before our\r\n     eyes. Towards the decline of that day, we had nothing of\r\n     Emily but her mortal remains as consumption left them. She\r\n     died December 19, 1848. We thought this enough; but we were\r\n     utterly and presumptuously wrong. She was not buried ere\r\n     Anne fell ill. She had not been committed to the grave a\r\n     fortnight, before we received distinct intimation that it\r\n     was necessary to prepare our minds to see the younger sister\r\n     go after the elder. Accordingly, she followed in the same\r\n     path with slower step, and with a patience that equalled the\r\n     other's fortitude. I have said that she was religious, and\r\n     it was by leaning on those Christian doctrines in which she\r\n     firmly believed that she found support through her most\r\n     painful journey. I witnessed their efficacy in her latest\r\n     hour and greatest trial, and must bear my testimony to the\r\n     calm triumph with which they brought her through. She died\r\n     May 28, 1849. What more shall I say about them? I cannot and\r\n     need not say much more. In externals, they were two\r\n     unobtrusive women; a perfectly secluded life gave them\r\n     retiring manners and habits.\"\r\n\r\nThough the above particulars be little more than the filling-up of an\r\noutline already clearly traced and constantly present whenever those\r\ncharacteristic tales recurred to us,--by those who have held other ideas\r\nwith regard to the authorship of \"Jane Eyre\" they will be found at once\r\ncurious and interesting from the plain and earnest sincerity of the\r\nwriter. She subsequently enters on an analysis and discussion of\r\n\"Wuthering Heights\" as a work of art;--in the closing paragraph of her\r\npreface to that novel, insinuating an argument, if not a defence, the\r\nurgency of which is not sufficiently admitted by the bulk of the world\r\nof readers. Speaking of the fiendlike hero of her sister's work, she\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n     \"Whether it is right or advisable to create beings like\r\n     Heathcliff, I do not know: I scarcely think it is. But this\r\n     I know; the writer who possesses the creative gift owns\r\n     something of which he is not always master--something that\r\n     at times strangely wills and works for itself. He may lay\r\n     down rules and devise principles, and to rules and\r\n     principles it will perhaps for years lie in subjection; and\r\n     then, haply without any warning of revolt, there comes a\r\n     time when it will no longer consent 'to harrow the valleys,\r\n     or be bound with a band in the furrow'--when it 'laughs at\r\n     the multitude of the city, and regards not the crying of the\r\n     driver'--when, refusing absolutely to make ropes out of\r\n     sea-sand any longer, it sets to work on statue-hewing, and\r\n     you have a Pluto or a Jove, a Tisiphone or a Psyche, a\r\n     Mermaid or a Madonna, as fate or inspiration directs. Be the\r\n     work grim or glorious, dread or divine, you have little\r\n     choice left but quiescent adoption. As for you--the nominal\r\n     artist--your share in it has been to work passively under\r\n     dictates you neither delivered nor could question--that\r\n     would not be uttered at your prayer, nor suppressed nor\r\n     changed at your caprice.\"\r\n\r\nIt might have been added, that to those whose experience of men and\r\nmanners is neither extensive nor various, the construction of a\r\nself-consistent monster is easier than the delineation of an imperfect\r\nor inconsistent reality--with all its fallings-short, its fitful\r\naspirations, its mixed enterprises, and its interrupted dreams. But we\r\nmust refrain from further speculation and illustration:--enough having\r\nbeen given to justify our characterizing this volume, with its preface,\r\nas a more than usually interesting contribution to the history of female\r\nauthorship in England.\r\n\r\nPertinently of these biographies, the _Athenaeum_ remarks that \"some of\r\nthe most daring and original have owed their parentage, not to defying\r\n_Britomarts_, at war with society, who choose to make their literature\r\nmatch with their lives,--not to brilliant women figuring in the world,\r\nin whom every gift and faculty has been enriched, and whetted sharp, and\r\nencouraged into creative utterance, by perpetual communication with the\r\nmost distinguished men of the time,--but to writers living retired lives\r\nin retired places, stimulated to activity by no outward influence,\r\ndriven to confession by no history that demands apologetic parable or\r\nsubtle plea.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] _Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey._ By Ellis and Acton Bell.

Smith, Elder\r\n& Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVIS ON THE LAST HALF CENTURY.[14]\r\n\r\nETHERIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1802, the late reverend and venerable DR. MILLER of New Jersey, then\r\nan active minister of the Presbyterian church in this city, published\r\nhere, in two large octavo volumes, the First Part of _A Brief Retrospect\r\nof the Eighteenth Century, containing a Sketch of the Revolutions and\r\nImprovements in Science, Arts and Literature, during that Period_. Six\r\nother volumes were contemplated, to cover grounds since occupied by the\r\ngreat work upon the Eighteenth Century, by Dr. Schlosser, but they never\r\nappeared. The facts embraced in Dr. Miller's Retrospect illustrated an\r\nextraordinary and successful intellectual activity in the preceding\r\nhundred years; but the fruits of investigation and reflection in that\r\ntime were less remarkable and important than those which have marked the\r\nfirst half of the Nineteenth Century, of which the Rev. EMERSON DAVIS,\r\nD.D., has attempted to give us a survey in a single duodecimo. Within\r\nsuch brief limits completeness and fulness were out of the question, but\r\nwe had a right to ask a judicious selection of topics, and--however\r\nbrief and imperfect,--a careful and an honest statement of facts. We are\r\nsorry to perceive that brevity is the only redeeming quality of Dr.\r\nDavis's performance. It is altogether worthless, in almost every\r\nrespect, and unless it tempt some competent person to the composition of\r\nan Account of the Progress of Society from 1800 to 1851, its appearance\r\nwill be a public misfortune, as well as a private disgrace. Perfectly to\r\njustify this condemnation we will copy a single section--the one\r\ntreating of the discovery of\r\n\r\n     \"LETHEON, OR SULPHURIC ETHER, &c.\r\n\r\n     \"In the autumn of 1846, it was announced in the public\r\n     journals that a dentist in Boston, W. T. G. Morton, had\r\n     discovered a method of extracting teeth without pain. Dr.\r\n     Morton, it seems, was satisfied that he could increase his\r\n     business to any extent he pleased, if he could only discover\r\n     a method by which he could extract and insert teeth without\r\n     any pain to the patient. Having some knowledge of the fact\r\n     that, by inhaling the vapor of ether, a state of\r\n     insensibility could be produced, he applied to Dr. Charles\r\n     T. Jackson to know if it could be done with safety. It\r\n     occurred to him that it might produce such a degree of\r\n     stupor that a tooth might be extracted without a\r\n     consciousness of what was doing [_meaning_ being done]. On\r\n     the 30th of September, 1846, he inhaled the vapor himself,\r\n     and found that he remained in an unconscious state eight\r\n     minutes. On the same day, he administered it with success to\r\n     a man who called to have a tooth extracted. The man, on\r\n     recovering his consciousness, did not know that any\r\n     instrument had been applied to his tooth. On the 16th and\r\n     17th of October, at the suggestion of Dr. Morton, ether was\r\n     administered to two patients at the hospital, who were to\r\n     have surgical operations performed. The experiment was\r\n     successful. As soon as the fact was known, it was generally\r\n     applauded by the newspapers as a wonderful discovery, and\r\n     the question came up, To whom belongs the honor, and who\r\n     shall reap the reward? Dr. Jackson, in a letter to M.\r\n     Beaumont, published in Galignani's Messenger, in Paris,\r\n     January, 1847, says, 'I request permission to communicate to\r\n     the Academy, through you, a discovery which I have made, and\r\n     which I regard as important to suffering humanity.' It\r\n     appears that the idea of using ether to render a person\r\n     insensible _to pain_, was original with Dr. Morton, and that\r\n     Dr. Jackson did no more than give Dr. Morton some\r\n     information respecting the nature of ether, and the best\r\n     mode of inhaling it. But as Dr. Jackson was better known as\r\n     a man of science, Dr. Morton consented to take the patent in\r\n     the name of both, and Dr. Jackson sold out his share to Dr.\r\n     Morton for ten per cent. of the income that might be derived\r\n     from the sale of rights to use the discovery.\r\n\r\n     \"In February, 1847, another letter appeared in Galignani's\r\n     Messenger, from Dr. H. Wells, of Hartford, Connecticut, in\r\n     which he claimed to be the discoverer of the fact that the\r\n     respiring of gas would produce insensibility to pain. Dr.\r\n     Wells had been about the country for a few years previous,\r\n     _lecturing upon gases_, and had often administered the\r\n     exhilarating, or nitrous oxide, gas. There is _no evidence_\r\n     that he ever administered ether. He might, in his\r\n     experiments, have found that persons under the influence of\r\n     the nitrous gas were insensible to pain, but he had no right\r\n     to claim that he discovered that the vapor of ether would\r\n     produce that effect. The French Academy, however, conferred\r\n     rewards of merit upon both Jackson and Wells, and, in 1848,\r\n     the American Congress awarded to Morton the honor of the\r\n     discovery.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1847, several sharp articles appeared in the Boston\r\n     papers, some favorable to Morton, and others to Jackson.\r\n     Wells committed suicide that year, and nothing more was said\r\n     respecting his claims. Some spicy pamphlets were written.\r\n     The result has been that, under the shelter of the smoke of\r\n     controversy, every one that chose has made use of the\r\n     discovery without paying Morton for the right, and that he\r\n     has been actually impoverished by the attention he gave to\r\n     the subject.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement is a tissue of falsehood and absurdity. To deny to Dr.\r\nWells the _entire_ credit of this discovery, argues simply gross\r\nignorance or insolence. Whenever any matter deserving of historical\r\ncommemoration is submitted to controversy, and the evidence is not full\r\nand absolute, and the decision is not unanimous or nearly so, the\r\nhistorian must _himself_ enter into the investigation, and in his own\r\nperson pronounce judgment. Therefore Dr. Davis has no excuse for so\r\nscandalous a misrepresentation of these events, in any communications or\r\nsuggestions by unknown parties. It was easy to be rightly informed, and\r\nunder such circumstances, ignorance is scarcely less criminal than\r\ndesigned falsehood. In this case, the decision has plainly been in favor\r\nof Dr. Wells, wherever there was authority of action. By means which we\r\ndo not care to state, but which are well known to us, Drs. Jackson and\r\nMorton did indeed procure of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, a\r\nrecognition of their joint claims to be regarded as the discoverers of\r\netherization. The Academy of Sciences is not a fit tribunal. The Paris\r\nMedical Society (of which the celebrated Chevalier Ricord is President)\r\nis; and this society, after an elaborate investigation of the whole\r\nsubject, during which it listened to a speech of several hours by Mr.\r\nWarren, the agent of Drs. Jackson and Morton, decided with the utmost\r\nunanimity that Dr. Wells made the discovery, and awarded him therefor\r\nthe sum of 25,000 francs.\r\n\r\nThe statement that Dr. Wells \"went about the country lecturing upon\r\ngases,\" is characteristically false. He never delivered even one\r\nlecture, upon any subject whatever, in his life. It is equally false\r\nthat \"the American Congress awarded to Morton the credit of the\r\ndiscovery.\" Congress has never made any decision or award at all in the\r\npremises. A committee was hastily appointed, and it presented a report,\r\nprobably prepared in Boston. The friends of Dr. Wells were not advised\r\nof any such attempt, and it was thought this report, with agreeing\r\nresolutions, could be smuggled through the House. But a counter report\r\nwas immediately offered, nevertheless, and so the game stopped.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, in these pages, enter into any detail of the history of this\r\nimportant discovery; but those who wish to investigate it, are referred\r\nto a pamphlet lately issued at Hartford, entitled, \"_Discovery by the\r\nlate Dr. Horace Wells of the Applicability of Nitrous Oxide Gas,\r\nSulphuric Ether, and other Vapors, in Surgical Operations, nearly two\r\nyears before the Patented Discovery of Drs. Charles T. Jackson and W. T.\r\nG. Morton_.\" This pamphlet was prepared by Mr. Toucey, recently Attorney\r\nGeneral of the United States, and nothing can be more conclusive and\r\nsatisfactory, to a fair inquirer, than the evidence contained in it,\r\nthat Drs. Jackson and Morton had never even the slightest thought of any\r\nthing like etherization, until Dr. Wells, some time after the discovery,\r\nproceeded to Boston, in the hope that Dr. Morton (who was under especial\r\nprivate obligations to him, and therefore was regarded by him as a\r\nfriend) would assist him in procuring for it larger publicity and\r\nrecognition. Poor Wells was only laughed at by these gentlemen, who, two\r\nyears afterward, claimed the discovery as their own!\r\n\r\nHow complete the discovery, and how successful the application of it,\r\nwill appear from the affidavit of Dr. Marcy. Mr. Toucey says:\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. E. E. Marcy, formerly of Hartford, now of the city of\r\n     New-York, was present at the rooms of Dr. Wells, by his\r\n     special request, to witness the operation upon Mr. F. C.\r\n     Goodrich, and witnessed it with the strong sensations\r\n     produced by a new and wonderful discovery upon a scientific\r\n     observer. He says, not only was the extraction accomplished\r\n     without pain, but the inhalation of the gas was effected\r\n     without any of those indications of excitement, or attempts\r\n     at muscular exertion, which do commonly obtain when the gas\r\n     is administered _without a definite object or previous\r\n     mental preparation_. 'By this experiment,' says Dr. Marcy,\r\n     'two important, and, to myself, _entirely new facts_ were\r\n     demonstrated: 1st. That the body could be rendered\r\n     insensible to pain by the inhalation of a gas or vapor,\r\n     capable of producing certain effects upon the organism. And\r\n     2d. When such agents were administered, to a sufficient\r\n     extent, for a definite object, and with a suitable\r\n     impression being previously produced upon the mind, that no\r\n     unusual mental excitement, or attempts at physical effort\r\n     would follow the inhalation.\r\n\r\n     \"'Witnessing these wonderful phenomena, these new and\r\n     astounding facts, the idea at once occurred to me whether\r\n     there were not other substances analogous in effect to the\r\n     gas, and which might be employed with more convenience and\r\n     with equal efficacy and safety. Knowing that the inhalation\r\n     of sulphuric-ether vapor gave rise to precisely the same\r\n     effects as those of the gas, from numerous former trials\r\n     with both these substances, I suggested to Dr. Wells, the\r\n     employment of the vapor of rectified sulphuric ether--at the\r\n     same time detailing to him its ordinary effects upon the\r\n     economy, and the method of preparing the articles for use.\r\n     Our first impression was, that it possessed all the\r\n     anaesthetic properties of the nitrous oxyd, was equally safe,\r\n     and could be prepared with less trouble, thus affording an\r\n     article which was not expensive, and could always be kept at\r\n     hand. At the same time, I told Dr. Wells that I would\r\n     prepare some ether, and furnish him some of it to\r\n     administer, and also make a trial of it myself, in a\r\n     surgical case which I expected to operate upon in a few\r\n     days. Not long after this conversation (to which allusion is\r\n     made by Mr. Goodrich, in his affidavit) I administered the\r\n     vapor of rectified sulphuric ether, in my office, to the\r\n     young man above alluded to, and after he had been rendered\r\n     insensible to pain, cut from his head an encysted tumor of\r\n     about the size of an English walnut. The operation was\r\n     entirely unattended with pain, and demonstrated to Dr. Wells\r\n     and myself, in the most conclusive manner, the anaesthetic\r\n     properties of ether vapor.'\r\n\r\n     \"We have narrated this important experiment in the language\r\n     of Dr. Marcy, to whose affidavit we take leave to refer, as\r\n     no part of it can, with any propriety or justice, be\r\n     overlooked by any one who proposes to subject this matter to\r\n     a searching examination. It shows the progress and the\r\n     successful result of these inquiries and experiments of Dr.\r\n     Wells, and of those skilful and liberal professional\r\n     gentlemen who co-operated with him. It shows that the\r\n     opinion was then entertained by Dr. Marcy, that the\r\n     constituents of the gas were more nearly allied to the\r\n     atmospheric air than were those of ether vapor--that the\r\n     former was more agreeable and easy to inhale than the\r\n     latter, and upon the whole was more safe and equally\r\n     efficacious as an anaesthetic agent--and that this opinion\r\n     was fully confirmed by numerous experiments subsequently\r\n     made by Drs. Ellsworth, Beresford, Riggs, Terry, Wells and\r\n     himself. It shows further, that _Dr. Wells visited Boston in\r\n     1844, for the purpose of communicating his discovery to the\r\n     faculty of that city, and that, on his return, he informed\r\n     Dr. Marcy that he had communicated it to Dr. C. T. Jackson,\r\n     and to Dr. Morton, and received from the former, and from\r\n     other medical gentlemen of Boston, nothing but ridicule for\r\n     his pains_.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no room for testimony. Mr. Toucey concludes his statement in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\n     \"More than a year and a half after Dr. Wells had personally\r\n     made known to Dr. Jackson, and to Dr. Morton, his former\r\n     pupil, the result of his experiments, more than one year\r\n     after the announcement in the Boston _Medical and Surgical\r\n     Journal_, published at their doors, we find Dr. Jackson and\r\n     Dr. Morton confederating together, taking out a patent for\r\n     this principle, and attempting ineffectually to appropriate\r\n     it to their joint pecuniary benefit! Dr. Jackson as the\r\n     philosopher, Dr. Morton as the operator! And shortly\r\n     afterwards, differing in almost every thing else, agreeing\r\n     nevertheless in one thing--each affirming of the other that\r\n     he was not entitled to the merit of the discovery!\r\n\r\n     \"Such is a brief statement of the proof, by which the mere\r\n     matter of fact is established, which induced the Legislature\r\n     of Connecticut to hail the late Dr. Horace Wells as a public\r\n     benefactor. With this accumulation of evidence on one side,\r\n     bearing directly upon the point, and _nothing to countervail\r\n     it on the other_, it is impossible to resist the conclusion\r\n     that he was the fortunate author of this great discovery,\r\n     unless one or the other of two propositions can be\r\n     established, namely, either that such a paralysis of the\r\n     nervous system as would render the subject insensible to\r\n     pain during the process of extracting teeth, would not\r\n     embrace the principle of it, or on the other hand, that\r\n     nitrous oxyd gas is arbitrarily to be excluded from its\r\n     proper place in a class of agents, all of which are nearly\r\n     identical in their operation. And even if this difficult\r\n     task could be accomplished, there would still remain another\r\n     equally difficult to be encountered; because it has already\r\n     been shown that Dr. Wells went beyond these limits, and that\r\n     Dr. Marcy, in conjunction with him, subjected the use of\r\n     sulphuric ether in a larger surgical operation, to the test\r\n     of successful experiment. But either of the foregoing\r\n     propositions would be too absurd to require a moment's\r\n     consideration. The principle is as fully developed by the\r\n     painless extraction of teeth, as by the painless amputation\r\n     of a limb; by the successful use of nitrous oxyd gas, as of\r\n     rectified sulphuric ether. In the language of Dr. Marcy:\r\n     'The man who first discovered the fact that the inhalation\r\n     of a gaseous substance would render the body insensible to\r\n     pain under surgical operations, should be entitled to all\r\n     the credit or emolument which may accrue from the use of any\r\n     substances of this nature. This is the _principle_--this is\r\n     the _fact_--this is the _discovery_. The mere substitution\r\n     of ether vapor or any other article for the gas, no more\r\n     entitles one to the claim of a _discovery_, than the\r\n     substitution of coal for wood in generating steam, would\r\n     entitle one to be called the discoverer of the powers of\r\n     steam.'\r\n\r\n     \"It is unnecessary to pursue the subject further. It would\r\n     be one of the greatest marvels of this wonderful age, if the\r\n     world, with these facts before it, did not confirm the\r\n     decision which it has already pronounced, and award to Dr.\r\n     Wells the merit of a discovery, which will be remembered and\r\n     appreciated as long as mankind shall be exposed to\r\n     suffering, or have occasion to apply an antidote.\"\r\n\r\nThe section upon etherization, we presume, will serve as a specimen of\r\nDr. Davis's _History_ of the First Half of the Eighteenth Century.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] _The Half Century; or a History of changes that have taken place,\r\nand events that have transpired, chiefly in the United States, between\r\n1800 and 1850_; with an introduction by Mark Hopkins, D.D. By Emerson\r\nDavis. D.D. Boston: Tappan & Whittenmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR LECTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far this season, there has been even more than the usual amount of\r\nlecturing in our principal cities. The mania lasts longer than was\r\nthought possible. The \"phenomenon\" has really become a feature of the\r\ntimes. It absorbs a great share of the current literary enthusiasm--much\r\nof which it has created, and will, it is to be feared, entirely satisfy.\r\nProfessor Pease, of the University of Vermont, in an essay upon the\r\nsubject, seeks to determine its import and value; to trace the feeling\r\nwhich gives it birth to its source, and to determine as accurately as\r\npossible the grounds of promise or of fear which it affords. \"These\r\ninterpretations,\" he says, \"vary between the widest extremes. On the one\r\nside is heard the exulting shout of those who whirl unresistingly in the\r\nvortex--'Does not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice?'\r\nbehold the 'progress of the species' and the 'march of mind!' And, on\r\nthe other side, the contemptuous murmur of those who will be overwhelmed\r\nrather than gyrate against their will, they know not whither--'What\r\nmeaneth this bleating of the sheep in mine ears?'\"\r\n\r\nThis mania for lectures, taken in connection with the prevailing\r\nliterary taste (of which it is in some sort an index), is regarded as\r\npointing, more or less directly, to a want of the human spirit--to its\r\ncry--strong and importunate, though often stifled and but dimly felt,\r\nfor light--the light of science and of truth. Many feel this want only\r\nas a _traditional_ need--one which their fathers before them have felt\r\nand have taught them to feel--and _they_ are apt to be satisfied with a\r\ntraditional supply. Others ask for science because it will help them\r\nmake, or work, and perchance _become_ machines, whereby they may earn\r\nbread: and oftentimes, says the writer, \"does this mere irritability of\r\nthe coating of the stomach pass itself off as the waking up the life of\r\nthe soul, and the sublime and pure aspirations of the spirit, for high\r\nand ultimate truths, pure as itself.\" Then, it is the fashion to be\r\nlearned, and the fops of literature, who must \"follow the fashion,\" of\r\ncourse, get wisdom as quickly and easily as possible. These are the main\r\nfeatures of that demand for science, which is now so clamorous. Mr.\r\nPease divides the lectures of the day into three classes; first those of\r\nwhich the object is instruction, then those designed to amuse, and last,\r\nthose which profess to serve both these purposes; and he thinks it may\r\nbe said of all, that they have no _vital, form-giving, organific\r\nprinciple_, running through them, developing properly each separate\r\npart, and uniting them all by its own power.\r\n\r\nIn these discourses he says: \"The carpenter is the actual model; for\r\nlike him the discourser cuts and fits his timber according to rules the\r\ngrounds of which it concerns not him to understand, with little labor\r\nbeyond that of hacking and hewing--materials being ever ready at his\r\nhand: for the world is full of books as the forest is of trees and the\r\nmarket of lumber. And this is done to instruct us; to build us up\r\ninwardly; to administer food to our intellect; to nourish our souls; to\r\nkindle the imagination and awaken to energetic action the living but\r\nslumbering world within. But, alas! this inner world cannot be kindled\r\nlike a smouldering fire, by a basket of chips and a puff of wind! This\r\ninner world is a world of spirits, which feed on thoughts full of truth\r\nand living energy. And thought alone can kindle thought: and truth alone\r\ncan waken truth: not veracity, not fact, but truth vital,\r\n\r\n        'Truth that wakes\r\n    To perish never.'\r\n\r\nThis is the bread for which the soul is pining, and such are the husks\r\nwith which its calls are answered.\"\r\n\r\nThere is in this statement of the predominant character of our popular\r\nlectures much that is true, as we could easily show by a definite\r\nexamination of the most popular discourses to which our audiences\r\nlisten. Every one can see that their aim is, not to announce great\r\ntruths, which are essential to the well-being of society, and the\r\ninstruction of the soul, but so to shape their sentences, so to point\r\ntheir paragraphs, and to give such a turn to their expressions, as to\r\ntickle most effectually the fancy of those who hear them, and to call\r\ndown that round of applause which tells them they have made a _hit_. Now\r\njust so far as this is the case, popular lecturing not only seeks to\r\nsupply the place of the theatre, but actually becomes theatrical; and\r\nlacking the essential worth and dignity of the drama, assumes its tricks\r\nand shallow vanities.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the author whom we have quoted sees in this fashion signs\r\nof promise, for it signifies the existence and the struggling toward the\r\nlight, of the absolute want of the soul--which will soon rectify the\r\npublic taste, and teach men that pleasure lies only in the life-giving\r\nand the true.\r\n\r\n\"In this,\" he says, \"lives an abiding ground of hope and cheerful\r\nconfidence; for it teaches us that every human heart has those depths\r\nand living powers in it, the healthful action of which is the true life\r\nand well-being of the soul--and in none, we hope, are they forever\r\ndormant; and no heart, we hope, is wholly closed. Light, though in rays\r\nfeeble and scattered, may shine in upon it, and it shall awake--for it\r\nis not dead, but sleepeth.... The feeling of wants that lie deeper and\r\nfarther inward than the sensual appetites, must be supplied or\r\nsuppressed; and hence arise a struggle and conflict between the\r\nantagonist principles of our being. Firm peace, and healthful, quiet\r\nenergy of soul, are the fruit of victory, and of victory only.\r\nTherefore, though attended with a 'troubled sea of noises, and hoarse\r\ndisputes,' the contest, with its hubbub and vain clamor, is the door to\r\nquietness and clear intelligence. Pedantry and pretension, quackery and\r\nimposture, shall, in spite of themselves, conduct to their own exposure\r\nand extinction; for a higher sway than ours guides all affairs, causing\r\neven the wrath of man to praise Him, and making folly itself the guide\r\nto wisdom. Hooker characterized his own times as 'full of tongue, and\r\nweak of brain;' and Luther said to the same effect, of the preachers and\r\nscholars of his day: 'If they were not permitted to prate and clatter\r\nabout it, they would burst with the greatness of their art and science,\r\nso hot and eager are they to teach.' But the noise and dust having\r\nsubsided, there is left us, of those very times, works which men will\r\nnot willingly let die. Noise and smoke causeless do not come. There is a\r\nforce at bottom which will ultimately work itself clear, and produce\r\ngood and substantial fruits. There is a force somewhere, or no foam and\r\ndust would rise: but there is little force in the foam and dust\r\nthemselves. And the immediate instruments are _only_ instruments,\r\nworking without knowledge what they do, like puppets, dancing and\r\nswinging their arms, while far behind resides the force that works the\r\nwires. All wonder bestowed upon _them_ is, most certainly, foolish\r\nwonder. But there is no ground for discouragement, or for any but good\r\nhopes, although ignorance and pretension stand in high places, and\r\nvainly babble concerning things beautiful and profound. This uproar\r\ncomes only from the troubling of the stream--the foam and roar will not\r\ncontinue always; the smooth plain lies below, along which it shall soon\r\nflow, quietly, but strongly, murmuring sweet music. And for the\r\nambitious rainbows painted in the mists above, there shall be the sweet\r\nreflection of earth and heaven from its calm bosom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD TIMES IN NEW-YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor William Livingston, of New Jersey, \"poet, philosopher and\r\nsage,\" in a letter written November 17th, 1744, gives the following\r\ninsight into life, as it then was, in New-York. He is describing a\r\n\"party:\"\r\n\r\n\"The feast as usual was preceded by cards, and the company so numerous\r\nthat they filled two tables; after a few games, a magnificent supper\r\nappeared in grand order and decorum--the frolic was closed up by ten\r\nsunburnt virgins lately come from Columbus's Newfoundland, and sundry\r\nother female exercises; besides a play of my own invention, which I have\r\nnot room enough to describe at present; however, kissing constitutes a\r\ngreat part of its entertainment.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1759, Livingston's father died, and his funeral obsequies were\r\nperformed in all the pomp and attended with all the expense customary in\r\ncolonial times. These took place in New-York. The lower apartments of\r\nmost of the stores in Broad-street, where he resided, were thrown\r\nopen--a pipe of wine was spiced--there were eight pall-bearers, and to\r\neach was presented a pair of gloves, a mourning ring, scarf and\r\nhandkerchief, and a spoon. These services were repeated at the manor,\r\nhis country-seat, and a handkerchief and pair of black gloves presented\r\nto each of the tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSSINI IN THE KITCHEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last accounts of Rossini, if we are to credit the pleasant stories\r\ntold of him by the Parisian wit, Louis Huart, are highly characteristic\r\nof the great _maestro_. The following _canard_ is one of the most\r\n_veritable_ and amusing:--\r\n\r\n\"The newspapers announce that Rossini has shut himself up at Bologna\r\nwith the celebrated tenor Donzelli, and that they pass their days in\r\nrehearsing a new opera, of which Rossini is finishing the score. After\r\nthe sea-serpent, I know of no story which returns more periodically than\r\nthe announcement of a new opera by Rossini. It is now fifteen years\r\nsince this pleasantry began to be invariably reproduced at the\r\ncommencement of every winter, and always with the same success. One\r\nbegins to meet in society a few Parisians who shrug their shoulders with\r\nan air of incredulity when you speak to them of the sea-serpent, but no\r\none dares to evince the least skepticism touching the new opera of\r\nRossini. We received this morning a letter from our correspondent at\r\nBologna, and he furnishes us with details which explain the\r\nannouncements in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\"Rossini is living in rather a retired way just now; and only receives\r\nthe regular visits of one person; there is an error, however, in the\r\northography of the appellation of this visitor. Instead of Donzelli, he\r\nis named Pastafrollo. He is no tenor! he is a cook! Rossini, in company\r\nwith Pastafrollo, is now busily occupied in endeavoring to discover a\r\nnew way of dressing turbot. Rossini has invented, up to the present day,\r\nsixty-two different ways of dressing this fish, but he repeats to\r\nwhoever will listen to him, that he will not die content until he has\r\ndiscovered a sixty-third method, which will satisfy him completely--then\r\nhe will divulge his secret, and have inscribed on the _cartes_ of all\r\nthe _restaurants_ in Europe--_turbot a la Rossini_. On that day, but\r\nthat day only, Rossini will make up his mind to open his piano and\r\ncompose a _cantata_ in honor of fish in general, and turbot in\r\nparticular. The passion of Rossini for cooking has been rendered more\r\nardent from the fact that the family of this illustrious personage do\r\nall they can to cross him in it. The relatives and friends of Rossini\r\nwish to make him believe that it is unworthy of a musician, and more\r\nespecially of a musician of his genius, to occupy himself with turbot;\r\nbut Rossini replies, history in hand, that a whole senate once devoted a\r\nlong sitting to find out what sauce would eat best with this fish.\r\nRossini's family do not consider themselves beaten as yet, and they have\r\norganized a sort of _cordon sanitaire_ round the house of the composer,\r\nto prevent the cooks from getting to him. Before this determination was\r\narrived at, Bologna overflowed with _chefs_, who arrived from every part\r\nof Italy, to consult Rossini on the best methods to be employed in\r\ndressing salmon, skate, carp, eels, and gudgeons.\r\n\r\n\"This furnishes us with an explanation of the reason why Pastafrollo was\r\nforced to employ a stratagem in order to prevent his being stopped in\r\nthe hall by the family of Rossini. Pastafrollo arrived at Bologna, under\r\nthe name of Donzelli, and took care to have inscribed on his passport\r\n_tenor_ instead of _cook_.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot conclude without giving expression to an earnest hope, that\r\nthe conferences established between Rossini and Pastafrollo may give\r\nbirth to the sixty-third mode of dressing turbot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PEACE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an entertaining article on \"The Abbe de Saint-Pierre,\" in the last\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_, there is this curious account of a \"Peace\r\nSociety.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Abbe de Polignac took Saint Pierre with him to the Congress of\r\nUtrecht. Witnessing all the difficulties which stood in the way of\r\nreconciliation between the contending parties, Saint-Pierre conceived\r\nthat the truest benefit which could be conferred on mankind would be the\r\nabolition of war. He at once proceeded to embody his idea, and published\r\nin 1713, the year in which peace was concluded, his 'Projet de Paix\r\nPerpetuelle,' in three volumes. The means by which he proposed that this\r\nperpetual peace should be preserved was the formation of a senate to be\r\ncomposed of all nations, and to be called _The European Diet_, and\r\nbefore which princes should be bound to state their grievances and\r\ndemand redress. The Bishop of Frejus, afterwards Cardinal de Fleury, to\r\nwhom Saint-Pierre communicated his plan, replied to him, 'You have\r\nforgotten the most essential article, that of sending forth a troop of\r\nmissionaries to persuade the hearts of princes, and induce them to adopt\r\nyour views.' D'Alembert has made one or two just remarks on\r\nSaint-Pierre's dream of universal peace, which are as applicable now as\r\nthey were a hundred years ago: 'The misfortune of those metaphysical\r\nprojects for the benefit of nations consists in supposing all princes\r\nequitable and moderate, in attributing to men whose power is absolute,\r\nand who have the perfect consciousness of their power, who are often\r\nexceedingly unenlightened, and who live always in an atmosphere of\r\nadulation and falsehood, dispositions which the force of law and the\r\nfear of censure so rarely inspire even in private persons. Whosoever, in\r\nforming enterprises for the happiness of humanity, does not take into\r\ncalculation the passions and vices of men, has imagined only a beautiful\r\nchimera.' Rousseau thought that, even if Saint Pierre's project were\r\npracticable, it would cause more evil all at once than it would prevent\r\nduring many ages.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer of this memoir of Saint Pierre presents the character of that\r\nremarkable person in a more favorable light than that in which we have\r\nbeen accustomed to regard it. The author of \"Paul and Virginia\" was very\r\nlikely a far better man than has been supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPT UNDER THE PHARAOHS.\r\n\r\nMR. KENRICK'S HISTORY.[15]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll nations turn to Egypt, as to the mother of civility, and the\r\nChristian sees there the prison where are detained, until the end of the\r\nworld, the witnesses of truths which vindicate his religion. How much\r\nthe Holy Land is our country, appears from this, that to all Christians,\r\nhowever remote the places where they live, the scenes about Jerusalem\r\nare more familiar than those about the capital of his own nation; and\r\nwith Egypt we are scarcely less intimately, though much less perfectly,\r\nacquainted. Within the last half century, great researches have been\r\nmade, by individual or national enterprise, into the poetry and\r\nantiquities of Egypt, by the enterprise of travellers and the diligence\r\nof archaeologists, among whom England claims the names of Young,\r\nWilkinson, and Vyse. But comparatively few know what has been the result\r\nof these researches. They lie scattered over a number of works in\r\ndifferent languages, beyond the reach even of the ordinary student, much\r\nmore of the general reader. Mr. Kenrick (of whose \"Ancient Egypt under\r\nthe Pharaohs\" we copy below the main portion of a reviewal in the London\r\n_Times_) has undertaken the task of supplying a synopsis, and this task\r\nhe appears to us to have accomplished excellently well. Mr. Kenrick is a\r\nvery estimable as well as a very accomplished man. Like the great\r\nmajority of the abler historical, philosophical and religious writers of\r\nEngland at this time, he is a _Dissenter_, which perhaps lessens\r\nsomewhat the warmth of the critic's commendations. We hope to see his\r\nwork, as well as that of Mr. Sharpe, relating to Egypt under the\r\nPtolemies, reproduced, by some of our own publishers. Of Mr. Kenrick,\r\nthe _Times_ says:--\r\n\r\n\"He commences with the land of Egypt. In the East great rivers are the\r\nparents of civilized nations. A great river, which by its deposit forms\r\na long valley and a broad delta of rich alluvial soil in the midst of\r\ndeserts, was the parent, the nourisher, and the god of the oldest\r\ncivilized nation of the earth. The Nile is Egypt; the Egyptians were\r\nthose who lived below the cataracts and drank of the Nile. Above the\r\ncataracts they pushed their arms into Ethiopia, and left there the\r\nmonuments of their dominion. To the west they were at once defended and\r\nconfined by a desert impassable to armies, but which the oasis rendered\r\npassable to the caravan. On the north was an almost harborless sea. On\r\nthe east was another desert, through which roads led to the ports of the\r\nRed Sea and the mines of Sinai. On the north-east the Arabian desert\r\nformed an imperfect barrier. It was traversed by the hosts of Sesostris\r\nand Sheshonk, of Nebuchadnezzar and Cambyses, and across its sands Egypt\r\ncommunicated commercially and politically with the other seats of\r\nancient civilization which, broken by the recurring desert, formed an\r\nirregular chain from Philistia to China.\r\n\r\n\"Of the singular productions of Egypt, the hippopotamus, the crocodile,\r\nthe ibis, the papyrus, we need not speak. There were few beasts of\r\nchase, and the Egyptian conquerors did not begin like those of central\r\nAsia by being mighty hunters. It was a land of corn, and of the vine, of\r\nfruit trees, and all herbs. The nations sought its granaries in famine;\r\nthe Israelites in the wilderness thirsted for the cooling vegetables of\r\nits gardens. Fish abounded in the Nile, waterfowl in the marshes. Nature\r\nyielded freely, but perhaps for that very reason the mind of man was\r\nless exercised and less active. And the unvarying landscape, the\r\nunchanging sky, the small number and unpoetic or even grotesque forms of\r\nthe plants and animals, may partly account for the lack of imagination\r\nevinced by the most formal and most stationary of nations, scarcely\r\nexcepting the Chinese.\r\n\r\n\"Who and whence were the Egyptians? This question Mr. Kenrick has to\r\nask, and, like others, to leave unanswered. This is the secret which the\r\ngrave of the Pharaohs will not yield. Physiology supplies no clue. The\r\nmummy cases, the paintings and sculptures, depict a race short, slight,\r\nwith low foreheads, high cheek bones, long eyes, hair now crisp now\r\ncurled, and a complexion which the conventionality of the painter's art\r\nmakes to differ in men and women, but which probably was brown with a\r\ntinge of red, dark compared with that of the Syrian, black compared with\r\nthat of the Greek. Thick lips are frequently seen, but they are supposed\r\nto indicate intermarriage with Ethiopians. From the negro the Egyptians\r\nwere far removed, nor can they be connected with any other known race.\r\nIf we turn to language, a surer guide perhaps than physiology, we are\r\nagain completely baffled. The Coptic has been identified through many\r\netymologies with the old Egyptian; and of the Coptic, though it became a\r\ndead language in the twelfth century, much literature remains. It is an\r\nuncultivated and formal tongue, with monosyllabic roots and rude\r\ninflexions totally different from the neighboring languages of Syria and\r\nArabia, totally opposite to the copious and polished Sanscrit. The last\r\nfact at once severs Egypt from India, and destroys every presumption of\r\naffinity that may arise from the presence in both countries of caste, of\r\nanimal worship, and of a religion derivable from a primitive adoration\r\nof the powers of nature. The hypothesis of an Ethiopian origin sprang\r\nfrom the notion, natural but untrue, that population would follow the\r\ncourse of the descending river. And no tradition among the Egyptians\r\nthemselves told of a parent stock or of another land.\r\n\r\n\"Respecting the mighty works of Egypt, little mystery remains. The great\r\nPyramids had been rifled by the Caliphs, if not by earlier hands, and no\r\ninscriptions have been found. But no doubt exists that they were the\r\nsepulchres of the Kings of Memphis. The Queens and the \"princes of\r\nNoph\" reposed in smaller pyramids beside the Kings. These mountains of\r\nwasted masonry belong to the earliest ages of the Pharaonic monarchy,\r\nbefore the time of the Sesostrian conquests, and therefore they bespeak\r\nthe toil and suffering, not of captives, but of native slaves. Before\r\nthem couches the Sphinx, hewn from the rock, to spare, as a Greek\r\ninscription says, each spot of cultivable land. His riddle--for it is _a\r\nmale_--is read. He represents, perhaps portrays, the reigning King, and\r\nthe thick lips may indicate Ethiopian blood. The lion's body represents\r\nthe monarch's might--the human head his wisdom. The rock, from which the\r\nfigure is cut, broke the view of the Pyramids, and to convert it into\r\nthe Sphinx was a stroke of Egyptian genius. Pyramids were, in the\r\nPharaonic times, peculiar to Memphis. The countless tombs of Thebes are\r\nexcavated in the rocky face of the Libyan hills. Those of the Theban\r\nPharaohs stand apart, and we approach through a narrow gorge called the\r\n\"Gate of Kings.\" The paintings, sculptures, and inscriptions on these\r\ntombs, literally the eternal _houses_ of the dead, are the Pompeii of\r\nthe Egyptian antiquary. At Thebes are the magnificent and temple-like\r\npalaces of the greatest of the Pharaohs, the halls of their assemblies\r\nand their counsels, the records of their wars and conquests. At Thebes,\r\ntoo, is the Memnon, a mutilated statue of Amnoph, which never was vocal\r\nexcept by trick or in imagination, and the Obelisks, whose form is\r\nsufficiently explained, without obscenity or mystery, by the fancy for\r\nmonolithic monuments and the possession of large blocks of granite. The\r\nremains of the Labyrinth do not enable us to pronounce whether its\r\ntwenty-seven halls were a burial-place for kings or crocodiles, or a\r\nplace of assembly for the provinces of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\"Very various and very extravagant notions have been formed of the\r\npopulation of ancient Egypt. That it was dense may well be inferred from\r\nthe length of time through which it multiplied in a limited space, and\r\nfrom that evident parsimony of land which drove tombs and monuments to\r\nthe rocks, and cities to the edge of the desert. Calculations based on\r\nthe number of cities, and on the number of men of military age, have\r\nplausibly placed the sum at about five millions.\r\n\r\n\"Agriculture was the chief business of the Egyptians, and the chief\r\nbusiness of agriculture consisted in distributing and detaining, by\r\ncanals and dams, the precious waters of the Nile. The sheep and cattle\r\nwere numerous. A grandee of Eilytheia possessed one hundred and twenty\r\ntwo cows and oxen, three hundred rams, twelve hundred goats, and fifteen\r\nhundred swine. Lower Egypt contained the great pasture lands, and was\r\nthe abode of the herdsmen--a lawless race, and, _therefore_, an\r\nabomination to their more civilized countrymen. The ass was the beast of\r\nburden. The horse was bred for the war-chariot--that great attribute of\r\nancient power. The breed was small but fine and peculiar to the country.\r\nThey were kept in stables along the Nile, and hence they do not appear\r\nin the landscapes. Horticulture was extensively and elaborately\r\npractised, both for use and pleasure; and the Pharaohs, like Solomon,\r\n'made them gardens and orchards, planted trees in them of all kinds of\r\nfruit, and made them pools of water to water therewith the wood that\r\nbringeth forth trees.'\r\n\r\n\"When forced to serve on shipboard by the enterprise of their own\r\nMonarchs or by their Persian conquerors, the Egyptians appear not to\r\nhave made bad sailors. They fought well at Salamis. But their natural\r\ntendency was to shun the sea, which they regarded as the element of the\r\nDestroyer Typhon. Their navigation was on the Nile, which formed the\r\nhighway of their commerce, the path of their processions and their\r\npilgrimages, and their passage to the tomb. The river being thus the\r\nuniversal road, and being moreover without bridges, must have swarmed\r\nwith boats of all descriptions--the heavy bari of the merchant, the\r\nlight papyrus or earthenware skiffs of the common people, and the\r\nsumptuous barge of Royalty, whose golden pavilion, masts, and rudder,\r\nfringed and embroidered sails, and sculptured prow, remind us of the\r\ngalley of Cleopatra. The caravans of surrounding nations visited Egypt\r\nwith their precious and fragrant merchandise to exchange for her corn\r\nand manufactures. But the Egyptian trader appears seldom to have visited\r\nother countries either by land or sea.\r\n\r\n\"The army was a warrior caste. Its might consisted in its chariots. No\r\nmounted cavalry appear in any of the monuments. With this exception they\r\nhad every kind of force and every weapon known to ancient warfare. They\r\nused the long bow and drew the arrow, like the English archers, to the\r\near. Their armor was imperfect, and more often of quilting than of mail.\r\nThey had regular divisions, with standards, and regular camps. Their\r\nsieges were unscientific, and their means of assault scaling ladders,\r\nsapping hatchets, and long pikes brought up to the walls under a sort of\r\nshed. Of their battles no definite notion can be formed. All is lost in\r\nthe King, whose gigantic figure, drawn by gigantic horses, crushes,\r\nmassacres, or grasps by the hair scores of his pigmy enemies, whose\r\nhands after the victory are laid in heaps before him and counted by\r\nattendant scribes. Thus it is that Rameses the Great and the other\r\nPharaohs are seen warring against the Assyrian, and Chaldean against the\r\nJew, the Edomite, the Ethiopian, and the 'nine bows' of Libya, and\r\nassailing the 'fenced cities' of strange races that have long passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"In the lower parts of civilization and the mechanical arts, the\r\nEgyptians had attained high perfection. Their machinery and tools appear\r\nto have been defective, but the defect was supplied by skill of hand,\r\ntraditional and acquired, as it is among the Chinese. They were cunning\r\nworkmen in metals, in jewelry, in engravings, in enamel, in glass, in\r\nporcelain, and in pottery. Their fine linen and embroidery were famous.\r\nFor their chariots Solomon gave 600 shekels of silver; and they\r\nfashioned into a hundred articles of luxury the ivory of Africa, the\r\nmahogany of India, and the cedar of Lebanon. As no specimens remain of\r\ntheir domestic architecture, it is supposed rather than ascertained that\r\ntheir houses were of a single story with a terraced roof. The rooms of\r\ngreat men at least were richly and elegantly painted, and furnished with\r\ntables, chairs, and couches, which have supplied models for the\r\nupholstery of modern times.\r\n\r\n\"Architecture is the most material of the arts. It was the art in which\r\nthe Egyptians most excelled. They seem to have understood in some degree\r\nthe grandeur which results from proportion and arrangement, as well as\r\nthat which results from size. The profuse and elaborate sculpture with\r\nwhich their temples are covered, does not mar their majesty. Their\r\nheaviness is relieved by the glowing sun and the deep sky. But the\r\nimpression produced must always have been that of cost and power rather\r\nthan of art. Some changes of style are noticed. The golden age was that\r\nof the Pharaohs of the 19th dynasty, when the power and greatness of the\r\nnation were at the highest. More florid and less majestic forms mark the\r\nera of the Ptolemies. But in this respect, as in others, the Egyptians\r\nseem to have maintained their stationary character, and the remains of\r\nMeroe, which are now known to be among the latest, have been taken for\r\nthe earliest of all the monuments.\r\n\r\n\"In sculpture the summit of manual skill was reached. But religion, the\r\nmistress and tyrant of Egyptian art, prescribed for the images of the\r\ngods her unalterable and often hideous forms, and the rules of an\r\nhereditary craft, which fixed certain proportions for each part of the\r\nstatue, and gave the execution of the several parts to several workmen,\r\nlaid another chain on the genius of the artist. Painting seems not to\r\nhave advanced beyond the barbarous excellence of brilliant colors.\r\nDrawing and design were monstrous, and the laws of perspective and even\r\nof vision unknown or disregarded. Of music, we learn from Plato that it\r\nwas restricted to certain established tunes of approved moral tendency,\r\nand the wayward Athenian thought all restraint wholesome as he saw that\r\nsome license was pernicious.\r\n\r\n\"If we pass to science, we shall find no reason for supposing that the\r\nadvances of modern times were anticipated by the mysterious wisdom of\r\nthe Egyptians. Something they must have known of astronomy to practise\r\nastrology, to divide the ecliptic, and to effect the exact orientation\r\nof the Pyramids. Some knowledge of chemistry is implied in their\r\nmanufacture of porcelain; some knowledge of physiology, pathology,\r\npharmaceutics and surgery, in their division of the medical art;\r\nsomething of geometry in their measurement of land; and something of\r\nmechanics in their enormous buildings and monuments. But their great\r\nengines were multitudes of laborers, aided by such natural expedients as\r\nthe lever, the roller, and the inclined plane, which can scarcely be\r\ncalled machines. In other sciences there is evidence of long and careful\r\nobservation, but nothing to prove an acquaintance with the _laws_ of\r\nnature. Progress in the medical art was precluded by the necessity of\r\nadhering to the precepts of the sacred books. Science was monopolized by\r\nthe priests; and it is said that by them the King was regularly sworn to\r\nretain the old and unintercalated year. The want of decimal notation,\r\nand the consequent clumsiness of the system of numeration, would go far\r\nto preclude the improvement of arithmetic, or any science into which\r\ncalculation entered.\r\n\r\n\"Literature the Egyptians appear to have had none, except of the\r\nmonumental or sacred kind, including under the latter head the sacred\r\nbooks of science. But the art of writing was practised by them, or at\r\nleast by the learned part of them, more extensively than by any\r\ncontemporary nation. Mr. Kenrick gives us a full history of the\r\ninterpretation of hieroglyphics, the key to which was first given by the\r\nparallel inscriptions in hieroglyphic and Greek found on the famous\r\nRosetta stone, and metes to Young and Champollion their due shares in\r\nthat discovery, of which each uncandidly claimed the whole. The\r\nhieroglyphics are now known to be of three kinds, all of which are\r\ngenerally mingled in the same inscription--the pictorial, the\r\nsymbolical, and the phonetic. The pictorial hieroglyphic is the simple\r\npicture of the thing signified. Symbolical hieroglyphics are, among\r\nothers, a crescent for a month, the maternal vulture for _maternity_,\r\nthe filial vulpanser for _son_, the bee for _a people obedient to their\r\nking_, the bull for _strength_, the ostrich feather with its equal\r\nfilaments for _truth_, the lotus for Upper and the papyrus for Lower\r\nEgypt. To these we may add the bird, which denotes a cycle of time (in\r\nCoptic _phanech_), and about which such wild fables were received by the\r\ncredulity of Herodotus and by that of the Fathers. But the greater part\r\nof the hieroglyphics are phonetic like our alphabet, and are being\r\nslowly and precariously deciphered into the words of a language which is\r\nidentified with the ancient form of Coptic.\r\n\r\n\"The religion of the Egyptians must be gathered chiefly from the\r\nsculptures and paintings. The religious inscriptions and funeral papyri\r\nremain undeciphered. The account of Herodotus is rendered suspicious by\r\nhis solicitude to force the Pantheon of Egypt into a conformity with\r\nthat of Greece. The accounts of the later Greeks are tainted by their\r\nphilosophizing and mysticizing spirit. That the Egyptian theology\r\nembodied no profound physical or metaphysical system is evident from the\r\nfact that it was not formed at once, but by gradual addition and\r\ndevelopment, and that it was to the last partly local. It appears to\r\nhave been, like the other religions of the Pagan world--of Greece and\r\nItaly, of Phoenicia and India--a worship of the powers of nature\r\nrepresented by great natural objects, such as the sun and moon, or by\r\nforms bestial or human, which were selected as symbolical of their\r\nattributes.\r\n\r\n\"On this groundwork imagination wrought, as among the Greeks, though to\r\na less extent and in a different way. We cannot tell how far the more\r\nreflective minds may have advanced towards the conception of a single\r\nGod, either independent of or permeating the material world; but contact\r\nwith the philosophic Greeks in the age of the Ptolemies can hardly have\r\nfailed to lead to some speculations of this kind, and the accounts\r\nderived from Greek sources of Egyptian mysticism, though false of early,\r\nwere no doubt, in part at least, true of later times. Amuna or Ammon\r\nappears to have been nominally the chief of the gods. His attributes are\r\nto some extent identified with those of the sun; but they are not easily\r\ndistinguished from the attributes of several subordinate deities. His\r\nram's head is still a mystery. Thoth was the god of intellect and\r\nlearning. His representatives were the ape and the ibis: the former, it\r\nis supposed, because it approaches nearest in intellect to man; the\r\nlatter, because its black and white feather resemble, or may be imagined\r\nto resemble, writing. The _popular_ divinity was Osiris, the god at once\r\nof the Nile and the realms below. Typhon, the scorching wind of the\r\ndesert which dries up the waters of the Nile, was the antagonist and the\r\nmurderer of Osiris; and at a more advanced stage of religious\r\nspeculation the two may have represented the conflicting powers of Good\r\nand Evil. Sacrifices were offered for the ordinary purposes--to\r\nconciliate the favor of the gods, to requite their benefits, and to\r\navert their wrath. Typhonian, that is, red-haired men, were immolated\r\nwhen they fell into the hands of the natives in honor of Osiris, whose\r\nname is concealed in that of the fabled Busiris. That the practice of\r\noffering human sacrifices is compatible with a high degree of\r\ncivilization we know from the examples of Greece, of Rome, and Mexico.\r\nThere were great gatherings in honor of the gods, in the nature of\r\npilgrimages or holy fairs, which were celebrated with festivity, with\r\nnoisy music, with illuminations, and with license. There were mysteries,\r\nwhich were not, in Egypt at least, initiations into any thing different\r\nfrom the popular religion; but merely representations--celebrated amidst\r\nnocturnal gloom--of the sufferings of Osiris. If strangers in Egypt\r\nunderwent painful initiation, it was an initiation into the knowledge of\r\nthe priests, and not into their mysteries. The Egyptians believed in the\r\nexistence of the soul after death; they believed that it would be judged\r\nin Amenthe by Osiris and his forty-two assessors, before whom it was\r\nbrought by Analis; they had an Elysium, surrounded by waters, where the\r\nOsirian--that is, the happy dead--ploughed, sowed, reaped, and threshed,\r\nas on earth--a singular want of fancy. Retributive pains, by fire and\r\nsteel, are also supposed to have been detected among the paintings. At\r\nthe same time they held and taught to the Greeks the doctrine of\r\nmetempsychosis. It is difficult to reconcile with either of these\r\nnotions their belief that the spirit dwelt in the body so long as the\r\nbody could be rescued from decay, and the reason which they give for\r\nbestowing such prodigality of labor on their sepulchres--that the tomb\r\nwas man's eternal home. The darkness of uninterpreted hieroglyphics\r\nstill rests to a great extent on the religious creed and practices of\r\nthe Egyptians. But three things we think we can discern from the\r\ninformation which Mr. Kenrick has collected:--1. That the Egyptian\r\nreligion was in all essential respects like the other religions of\r\nPaganism, and traceable to the same sources; and consequently that\r\nwhatever may be Egypt's 'place in universal history,' she is not likely\r\nto assume an extraordinarily important place in the history of theology,\r\nor to affect, in any material respect, our views as to the origin of\r\nreligion. 2. That no connection is to be traced between the religion of\r\nthe Egyptians and the religion of the Hebrews. A more decided polytheism\r\nthan that of Egypt cannot be imagined. So far from recognizing any thing\r\nlike the _supremacy_ of a single Divine Being in their theological\r\nsystem, we can scarcely even trace any thing answering to that primacy\r\nof Jupiter which preserves at least a vestige of monotheism in the\r\nreligion of the Greeks. The rite of circumcision, which is supposed to\r\nhave been borrowed by one nation from the other, was not practised by\r\nthe Egyptians as a religious ceremony, nor upon infants, nor\r\nuniversally. And it is remarkable that the belief in the conscious\r\nexistence of the soul and a retributive state after death--a doctrine\r\nhardly to be lost when once imparted--seems to have been so prominent in\r\nthe one faith while it was so much the reverse of prominent in the\r\nother. 3. That there was no connection between the mythology of Egypt\r\nand that of Greece. Subtract what is common to all polytheistic systems,\r\nand what is common to all systems of natural religions, and absolutely\r\nno similarity remains. On the one side are forms of human beauty,\r\nmajesty, and passion, in which the original groundwork of nature-worship\r\nis as much as possible concealed by the working of a plastic\r\nimagination; on the other side are forms bestial or grotesque,\r\nfeatureless and passionless, exhibiting nature-worship in one of its\r\nlowest stages. But in every respect, in language, in physiognomy, in\r\nmind, in political tendencies, in manners, as well as in religion, the\r\ncontrariety between the Egyptian and the Athenian is complete. There is\r\nnothing on the other side except the vain pretensions of the priests of\r\nThebes, the credulity of Herodotus, and the wildest legends of the\r\nmythical age; and we are surprised that so strict an ethnologist as Mr.\r\nKenrick should be inclined to admit even the general fact of an\r\nEgyptian colonization.\r\n\r\n\"The most degrading part of the religion of the Egyptians was their\r\nanimal worship, which they carried to a higher pitch than any other\r\npeople, not excepting the Hindoos. Almost the whole animal and some part\r\nof the vegetable kingdom enjoyed either a national or a local sanctity.\r\nGods it was said grew in the gardens. The most cogent reasons of policy\r\nand the terrible name of Rome failed to save from death the Roman who\r\nhad killed a cat. Fancy had first assigned to each god his favorites or\r\nsymbols among beasts or plants. Then the beasts and plants themselves\r\nwere reverenced, and at last worshipped. Stately avenues of colossal\r\nstatues, magnificent porticoes and columned courts ushered the\r\nawe-stricken devotee into the sacred presence of an ibis or an ape. The\r\nhighest object of this superstition, the bull Apis, was regarded as an\r\nactual incarnation of Osiris. No rational account of such a system can\r\nbe given. The serpent cannot have been respected for its utility. The\r\nibis cannot have been honored as the destroyer of the sacred serpent.\r\nNothing divine can have been perceived in the beetle or the ape. The\r\nconnection between the god and the beast was originally the offspring of\r\na grotesque imagination, and priestcraft and the superstitious tendency\r\nof the people did the rest.\r\n\r\n\"The political constitution of Egypt was based on caste. The privileged\r\ncastes were those of the warriors and the priests, who, with the\r\nPharaoh, held in fee all the land of Egypt. The Government was an\r\nhereditary monarchy. When election was necessary the two privileged\r\ncastes chose from among their own numbers; the people enjoyed only the\r\nright of acclamation. If the choice fell on a warrior, he was at once\r\nreceived into the order and initiated into the wisdom of the priests.\r\nLegislation was the prerogative of the King; but he was bound to rule\r\nand judge according to the law. He was much in the hands of the priests,\r\nwho imposed strict rules upon his life, and by a daily homily made the\r\nduties and virtues of sovereignty familiar, perhaps too familiar, to the\r\nroyal ear. The priests, in fact, were the lords of Egypt. Exclusively\r\npossessed of science, and even of letters, numerous, wealthy, united, in\r\na single polity, a confined territory and an isolated people, unchecked\r\nby any literary, philosophical, or foreign influence, they must have\r\nexercised a dominion unrivalled by any priesthood in the history of the\r\nworld. The result was a land of temples, of deified apes and consecrated\r\nonions, a literature of religious inscriptions and funeral scrolls, a\r\nGovernment apparently mild and humane, an enduring polity and long\r\ninternal peace, and intense and stubborn nationality, a civilization\r\nwonderful but low, which in every department, from the act of government\r\nto the art of writing, appears to have remained as nearly as possible at\r\na fixed point for about two thousand years. The mummy, as it is the\r\ncharacteristic product, is the fit emblem of ancient Egypt. Yet material\r\nhappiness appears to have been enjoyed. From sports, from caricatures,\r\nfrom the fanciful decorations of their houses, from their use of music\r\nas a daily recreation, we should judge that the Egyptians were not a\r\ngloomy people; and that their social and political system aimed, though\r\nimperfectly, at a high standard, may be inferred from the reverence,\r\nhowever exaggerated, which was entertained for it by the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\"Egyptian history is the 'dynasties' of Manetho partly filled up and\r\nillustrated, and in time it is to be hoped to be filled up and\r\nillustrated still more from the monuments, paintings, and inscriptions.\r\nFor this, with its thirty dynasties, its twenty centuries, and its\r\nchronological difficulties, still formidable though much reduced, we\r\nmust refer the reader entirely to Mr. Kenrick's second volume, of which\r\nit occupies nearly the whole. The slight sketch above given indicates\r\nthe contents of what will be to the general reader the more interesting\r\npart of the work. In conclusion, we once more cordially commend the\r\nbook. It displays not only the ordinary merits of a good synopsis, such\r\nas clearness of style and of arrangement, but also a high power of\r\ncombination, and, where the author treats of philosophical questions, a\r\nsound and sensible philosophy. On some points, perhaps, Mr. Kenrick\r\nmight have spoken with more authority had he personally visited Egypt,\r\nand the imagination of his reader would be assisted by a well selected\r\nvolume of plates. We are glad to see that Syria and Phoenicia are to\r\nform the subject of another publication by the same hand.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] _Ancient Egypt under the Pharaohs._ By John Kenrick, M. A. In two\r\nvolumes. London: B. Fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMILLE DESMOULINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an admirable life of Camille Desmoulins, recently published in Paris,\r\nby M. Edmond Fleury, his summing up of the character of the _Vieux\r\nCordelier_, presents a type of some of the heroes of the revolution of\r\n1848:--\r\n\r\n\"Such was Camille Desmoulins. I have traced his portrait without pity,\r\nwithout hatred, I dare not say without passion. In him I wished to mark\r\nthe truest and most finished type of those _enfans perdus_ of anarchy\r\nwho, without ever attaining illustration in history, or serious\r\ninfluence in a government, thirst after distinction and renown;\r\nambitious of credit and importance, scourges of their country, torment\r\nof their relatives, traitors to their friends, their own executioners,\r\nflambeaux that burn without light, vain and mediocre spirits consumed by\r\nthe most intense jealousy--presumptuous fools, irritated by their own\r\nimpotence, intrepid in a pamphlet and pusillanimous in action, they,\r\nnevertheless, carried away by the flood which they have let loose,\r\nstake, in this terrible game of revolutions, not only their lives, but\r\nthe honor of their posthumous fame.\"\r\n\r\nHow different the aspect of these fiends, as they are presented to us\r\n\"sicklied o'er\" with the sentiment of a Lamartine!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE CHURCHES IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review_, for January, 1851,\r\ncontains a great article on the controversies occasioned by the recent\r\nmovements of the Roman Catholics in Great Britain. It is very long\r\n(making sixty pages), and very able. Reviewing the battle, from an\r\nunusual, and to most people perhaps a not very accessible, point of\r\nview, it throws a startling light on many matters forgotten or ignored\r\nby the more immediate combatants. It may, therefore, be perused with\r\ninterest and advantage by partisans of every shade. Protestant and\r\nCatholic will find their account in it, especially as helping them to\r\ninformation of which they are greatly deficient--a knowledge of each\r\nother's strong points, as well as their weak ones. There is much in the\r\nviews of the writer, with which we cannot ourselves concur; but we are\r\nnot insensible of the force and precision with which he has mapped out a\r\nlarge part of the field, and given saliency to some of the great\r\nprinciples at stake; which it is the natural tendency of discussions,\r\ninvolving so much of the conventional and formulistic, calamitously to\r\nobscure. The battle in the foreground may be about candlesticks,\r\nsurplices, and genuflexions. But there are involved many things\r\ninfinitely more vital, as the author of this \"Battle of the Churches\"\r\nwill be admitted to have illustrated with great success. Many ponderous\r\nvolumes might be named, which have not contributed a tenth part as much\r\nto a clear understanding of the question, as this one article in the\r\n_Westminster_. We have not space for a complete _resume_ of it. We can\r\nonly present an extract or two. The following brings forward tendencies\r\ntoo little noticed by the antagonists of the papacy:\r\n\r\n\"A true British Protestant, whose notions of \"Popery\" are limited to\r\nwhat he hears from an evangelical curate or has seen at the opening of a\r\nJesuit church, looks on the whole system as an obsolete mummery; and no\r\nmore believes that men of sense can seriously adopt it, than that they\r\nwill be converted to the practice of eating their dinner with a\r\nChinaman's chop-sticks instead of the knife and fork. He pictures to\r\nhimself a number of celibate gentlemen, who glide through a sort of\r\nminuet by candle-light around the altar, and worship the creature\r\ninstead of the Creator, and keep the Bible out of every body's way, and\r\nmake people easy about their sins: and he is positive that no one above\r\na \"poor Irishman,\" can fail to see through such nonsense. Few even of\r\neducated Englishmen have any suspicion of the depth and solidity of the\r\nCatholic dogma, its wide and various adaptation to wants ineffaceable\r\nfrom the human heart, its wonderful fusion of the supernatural into the\r\nnatural life, its vast resources for a powerful hold upon the\r\nconscience. We doubt whether any single reformed church can present a\r\ntheory of religion comparable with it in comprehensiveness, in logical\r\ncoherence, in the well-guarded disposition of its parts. Into this\r\ninterior view, however, the popular polemics neither give nor have the\r\nslightest insight: and hence it is a common error both to underrate the\r\nnatural power of the Romish scheme, and to mistake the quarter in which\r\nit is most likely to be felt. It is not among the ignorant and vulgar,\r\nbut among the intellectual and imaginative--not by appeals to the senses\r\nin worship, but by consistency and subtlety of thought--that in our days\r\nconverts will be made to the ancient church. We have receded far from\r\nthe Reformation by length of time; the management of the controversy has\r\ndegenerated: it has been debased by political passions, and turned upon\r\nthe grossest external features of the case; and when a thoughtful man,\r\naccustomed to defer to historical authority, and competent to estimate\r\nmoral theories as a whole, is led to penetrate beneath the surface, he\r\nis unprepared for the sight of so much speculative grandeur, and, if he\r\nhave been a mere Anglican or Lutheran, is perhaps astonished into the\r\nconclusion, that the elder system has the advantage in philosophy and\r\nantiquity alike. From this, among other causes, we incline to think that\r\nthe Roman Catholic reaction may proceed considerably further in this\r\ncountry ere it receives any effectual check. The academical training and\r\nthe clerical teaching of the upper classes have not qualified them to\r\nresist it. At the other end of society there are large masses who cannot\r\nbe considered inaccessible to any missionary influence, affectionately\r\nand perseveringly applied. Not all men, in a crowded community, are\r\ncapable of the independence, the self-subsistence, without which\r\nProtestantism sinks into personal anarchy. The class of weak, dependent\r\ncharacters, that cannot stand alone in the struggle of life, are\r\nunprovided for in the modern system of the world. The cooperative\r\ntheorist tries to take them up. But somehow or other he is usually a man\r\nwith whom, by a strange fatality, cooperation is impossible; intent on\r\nuniting all men, yet himself not agreeing with any; with individuality\r\nso intense and exclusive, that it produces all the effect of intolerant\r\nself-will; and thus the very plans which by his hypothesis are\r\ninevitable, are by his temper made impracticable. He appeals, however,\r\nand successfully, to the uneasiness felt by the feeble in the strife and\r\npressure of the world; he fills the imagination with visions of repose\r\nand sympathy; he awakens the craving for unity and incorporation in some\r\nvast and sustaining society. And whence is this desire, disappointed of\r\nits first promise, to obtain its satisfaction? Is it impossible that it\r\nmay accept proposals from the most ancient, the most august, the most\r\ngigantic organization which the world has ever seen?--that it may take\r\nrefuge in a body which invests indigence with sanctity--which cares for\r\nits members one by one--which has a real past instead of a fancied\r\nfuture, and warms the mind with the coloring of rich traditions--which,\r\nin providing for the poorest want of the moment, enrolls the disciple\r\nin a commonwealth spread through all ages and both worlds! Whatever\r\nsocialistic tendency may be diffused through the English mind is not\r\nunlikely, in spite of a promise diametrically opposite, to turn to the\r\nadvantage of the Catholic cause.\"\r\n\r\nHere is another valuable contribution to the philosophy of this\r\ncontroversy. There are few positions more relied on by Roman Catholics,\r\nor more thoroughly unsound and fallacious, than the assertion that there\r\nare no essential differences between the position of Roman Catholics and\r\nof Protestants as regards the state and the English established church.\r\n\r\n\"If we had to deal simply with a form of worship and theology, there\r\nwould be no ground for distinguishing between the case of the Catholics\r\nand that of the Dissenters.\" And practically perhaps, in the actual\r\ncondition of Europe, the question now in agitation might be permitted to\r\nrest there. But, in fairness to the Protestant feeling, it should never\r\nbe forgotten that the Roman Catholic system presents a feature absent\r\nfrom every other variety of nonconformity. It is not a religion only,\r\nbut a polity; and this in a very peculiar sense. Other systems also--as\r\nthe Presbyterian--include among their doctrines an opinion in favor of\r\nsome particular church government; which opinion, however, professing to\r\nbe derived from Scripture by use of private judgment, stands, in their\r\ncase, on the same footing with every other article of their creed. You\r\nmight differ from John Knox about synods, without prejudice to your\r\nagreement in all else. But with the Romish church it is different. It is\r\nnot that her religion contains a polity; but that her polity contains\r\nthe whole religion. The truths she publishes exist only as in its\r\nkeeping, and rest only on its guarantee; and if you invalidate it, they\r\nwould vanish, like the promissory notes of a corporation whose charter\r\nwas proved false. Christianity, in her view, is not a doctrine,\r\nproductive of institutions through spontaneous action on individual\r\nminds; but an institution, the perpetual source of doctrine for\r\nindividual obedience and trust. Revelation is not a mere communication\r\nof truth, not a transitory visit from heaven to earth, ascertained by\r\nhuman testimony, and fixed in historical records; but a continuous\r\nincarnation of Deity, a permanent real presence of the Infinite in\r\ncertain selected persons and consecrated objects. The same divine\r\nepiphany which began with the person of the Saviour has never since\r\nabandoned the world: it exists, in all its awfulness and power, only\r\nembodied no longer in a redeeming individual, but in a redeeming church.\r\nThe word of inspiration, the deed of miracle, the authority to condemn\r\nand to forgive, remain as when Christ taught in the temple, walked on\r\nthe sea, denounced the Pharisee, and accepted the penitent. These\r\nfunctions, as exercised by him, were only in their incipient stage; he\r\ncame,--to exemplify them indeed, but chiefly to incorporate them in a\r\nbody which should hold and transmit them to the end of time. From his\r\nperson they passed to the College of the Twelve, under the headship of\r\nPeter; and thence, in perpetual apostleship, to the bishops and pastors,\r\nordained through legitimate hands, for the governance of disciples.\r\nThese officers are the sole depositaries, the authorized trustees of\r\ndivine grace; whose decision, whether they open or shut the gate of\r\nmercy, is registered in heaven and is without appeal. Not that they can\r\nplay with this power, and dispose of it by arbitrary will. The media\r\nthrough which it is to flow have been divinely appointed: its channels\r\nare limited to certain physical substances and bodily acts or postures,\r\nselected at first hand for the purpose:--water at one time, bread at\r\nanother, oil at a third, handling of the head at a fourth. But the\r\ninfusion of the supernatural efficacy into these \"alvei\" depends on an\r\nact of the appointed official; through whom alone the divine matter--no\r\nlonger choked up--can have free currency into the persons of believers.\r\nTo this inheritance of miracle is added a stewardship of inspiration.\r\nThe episcopate is keeper of the Christian records: and as those records\r\nare only the first germ of an undeveloped revelation, with the same body\r\nis left the exclusive power of unfolding their significance, and\r\ndirecting the growth and expansion of their ever fertile principles.\r\nWhatever interpretation the hierarchy may put upon the Scriptures,\r\nwhatever doctrine or discipline they may announce as agreeable with the\r\nmind of God, must be accepted as infallible and authoritative. The same\r\nspirit of absolute truth which spoke in the living voice of Christ,\r\nwhich guided the pen of evangelists, still prolongs itself in the\r\nthought and counsels of bishops, and renders their collective decisions\r\nbinding as divine oracles. The people who form the obedient mass of the\r\nCatholic body are not without a share of this miraculous light in the\r\nsoul; not indeed for the discernment of any new truth, but for the\r\napprehension of the old. The moment the disciple is incorporated in the\r\nchurch, faith bursts into sight; he passes from opinion into knowledge;\r\nhe perceives the objects of his worship, and the truth of his creed,\r\nwith more than the certainty of sense; and as he bows before the altar,\r\nor commits himself to the \"Mother of God,\" the real presence and the\r\ninvisible world are as immediately with him as the breviary and the\r\ncrucifix. Through the whole Catholic atmosphere is diffused a\r\npreternatural medium of _clairvoyance_, which at every touch of its\r\nritual vibrates into activity, and opens to adoring view mysteries hid\r\nfrom minds without.[16]\r\n\r\n\"Now, with the spiritual aspects of this theory we are not here\r\nconcerned. Reason has no jurisdiction over the inspiration that\r\ntranscends it. But there is a humbler task to which the common intellect\r\nis not incompetent. We may plant this system in a political community,\r\nset it down beside the state, imagine it surrounded by families, and\r\nschools, and municipalities, and parliaments, by the prison and the\r\ncourt of justice; within the shadow of law and in the presence of\r\nsovereignty; and we may ask how it will work amid these august symbols\r\nof a nation's life, and how adjust itself in relation to them? Will it\r\nleave them to their free development? Can it tranquilly coexist with\r\nthem, and be content to see them occupy the scope which English\r\ntraditions and English usage have secured for them? We are convinced it\r\ncannot; that every step it may make is an encroachment upon wholesome\r\nliberty; that it is innocent only where it is insignificant, and where\r\nit is ascendant will neither part with power, nor use it well; and that\r\nit must needs raise to the highest pitch the common vice of tyrannies\r\nand of democracies--the relentless crushing of minorities.\"\r\n\r\nThe above are only two paragraphs out of a dozen we had marked, but they\r\nwill suffice to show the value of this very able and impartial essay.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Adequate authority for these statements will be found in Dr.\r\nMochler's Symbolism, part i. chap. v., and in Newman's Lectures, iii. p.\r\n66, and Lecture ix. passim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING OF SIR ALEXANDER BOSWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the new books in England is one entitled \"Modern State Trials\" by\r\nWilliam C. Townsend, in two octavos. In the _Times_ of the second of\r\nJanuary we find a reviewal of it, characteristically pungent. \"Why Mr.\r\nTownsend conceived it necessary to dignify his collection with the above\r\nsolemn title,\" says the critic, \"we are at a loss to conjecture. Madame\r\nTussaud does not invite a curiosity-seeking public to her museum of\r\nhorrors by disguising the naked hideousness of her groups, or by lending\r\nthem a factitious grace which it is hardly their interest to borrow. The\r\npublication is essentially popular, was meant for general perusal, is\r\nmade up of any thing but technical details, and gives nothing to, as it\r\nreceives nothing from, purely professional lore. A batch of interesting\r\ntrials is very commendable, and need not be afraid of occupying its own\r\nground. That of Courvoisier for the murder of Lord William Russel, of\r\nthe Wakefields for the abduction of Miss Turner, of Lord Cardigan for\r\nshooting in a duel, and of John Ambrose Williams for a libel on the\r\nDurham clergy, cannot by any stretch of fancy be converted into _state_\r\nprosecutions, though they fairly enough find admittance into a book\r\nwhich treats of our _causes celebres_. The 'state' trials of the volume\r\nbefore us are the ha'porth of bread to the gallons of sack. The\r\nlegitimate is paraded to call attention from the spurious, the vulgar is\r\nto find respectability by walking arm in arm with the classical. There\r\nwas really no necessity for the 'sham.' A crooked stick on a heath has\r\nits picturesqueness as well as the Corinthian column. We may be very\r\ninteresting rascals though we do not poke our walking-canes into the\r\nface of majesty, or go out on a fool's errand against the Queen's lieges\r\nwith Mr. John Frost.\" The author's style is described as very\r\nunsatisfactory, though full of pretension. He is \"very bombastic, very\r\ninexact, and strangely independent in the current of his thoughts and in\r\nthe arrangement of his words.\" But the _Times_ admits nevertheless the\r\ninteresting quality of the work, and in its own better language gives\r\nthe following _resume_ of one of the most celebrated cases stated in\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n\"Of all the trials contained in these volumes none have a more\r\nmelancholy interest, perhaps, than that of Mr. Stuart, who was tried on\r\nthe tenth of June, 1822, before the High Court of Justiciary at\r\nEdinburgh, for killing Sir Alexander Boswell in a duel. Mr. Stuart was,\r\nof course, acquitted. He had been the aggrieved party; he had found it\r\nnecessary to the vindication of his honor to call his unfortunate\r\nantagonist to account; he had been forced, by the cruel exaction of\r\npublic opinion, to expose his life to the weapon of a man he had never\r\noffended, and who, indeed, in his heart, bore his involuntary murderer\r\nno malice; and public opinion, expressed in the verdict of a jury, knew\r\nbetter than to sentence to death the wretched victim of its own brutal\r\nand unwarrantable edicts. Fortunately for the interests of humanity, we\r\nhave at length reached a period when it becomes unnecessary to protest\r\nvehemently against the iron rule of an authority more despotic than that\r\nof absolute kings, and far more cruel and oppressive than the laws which\r\nbut a few years ago attached the penalty of death to the commission of\r\nalmost pardonable offences. Society, with the acquirement of other\r\nuseful knowledge, has learned to appreciate the iniquitous folly of\r\nmurder perpetrated in cold blood, without the slightest excuse. The\r\nnation which above all the countries of the world takes credit for\r\nadapting its laws to the requirements of a rapidly advancing\r\ncivilization, has had courage to inquire why the savage vestige of an\r\nexploded system should still dishonor its history and interfere with its\r\nsocial progress. Duelling, as part and parcel of the national manners,\r\nhas ceased in England. No doubt random shots will yet from time to time\r\nbe heard, and weakness in its despair will occasionally seek refuge in\r\ncowardice, which it mistakes for valor; but the mind of the majority is\r\nmade up. Duelling henceforth must be the exception, not the rule. Public\r\nopinion will harmonize with the law, and honor it. It will protect the\r\ninjured, and hand over the offenders to the legitimate consequences of\r\ntheir own misdeeds. It will not call upon a man first to endure wrong,\r\nand then to lay bare his breast to the bullet of his aggressors.\r\n\r\n\"Our fathers were less fortunate than ourselves in this respect. Their\r\ndilemma was fearful. The law took no account of those delicate injuries\r\nunder which sensitive honor pines, though no bruise or wound appears to\r\nindicate the mischief; and, in self-defence, refinement set up the\r\nbloodiest code brutality under the guise of chivalry could imagine or\r\ninvent. A quiet gentleman, sitting from morning till night in his\r\nlibrary, interfering with the pleasures and pursuits of none, amiable in\r\nevery relation of life, a stanch friend, a fond husband, a devoted\r\nfather, as useful a member of society as you might find in a day's\r\njourney, and obnoxious only to political opponents, who fear him more\r\nthan he dislikes them, is called a 'liar,' a 'coward,' and a 'heartless\r\nruffian.' He is nothing of the kind; he is proudly conscious of this\r\nfact; his accusers do not even believe it; the world--that portion of it\r\nin which he moves--is satisfied that he is a remarkable instance of\r\ntruth, of courage, and extreme tenderness of spirit. The revilers have\r\nmade a great mistake or committed a disgraceful outrage. In either case,\r\nsince they are not amenable to law, you would think they might safely be\r\nleft to acquire better information and improve their manners. Not a bit\r\nof it. The quiet gentleman's enemies have aimed a blow at his\r\nreputation. They are good shots--which unfortunately he is not--and now\r\nthey must aim another at his life; society 'allows it,' and society\r\n'awards it.' The quiet gentleman makes his will, kisses his children,\r\nshuts up his books, sighs, and 'goes out.' The quiet gentleman is\r\nkilled; a million men could not restore the life one man has taken.\r\nSociety is distressed beyond expression; so is the murderer, who is all\r\nsorrow and tenderness for the departed. There is general weeping, and\r\ngreat unavailing regret, and much commiseration for the widow: and then\r\na mock trial, and no end of speechifying, beautiful remorse on the part\r\nof the survivor, lovelier tributes to the memory of deceased, a verdict\r\nof not guilty, and a dismissal of the murderer and his accomplices into\r\nthe world, which is worthy of them as they are worthy of it. The picture\r\nrepresents a common event of the time of George the Third. Let us\r\nconfess that, degenerate as we are, we have changed, in some respects,\r\nfor the better since those 'good old days!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us also bear in mind the main cause of our improvement! It is due\r\nto the majesty of law, to state that, had she been less faithful,\r\nsociety would have grown more reckless. Public opinion and the law of\r\nthe country have had a hard fight for the mastery, and had the latter\r\ngiven way but an inch, the former would have found us to-day in the\r\nhands and at the mercy of the bullies. Judges have never hesitated to\r\ndeclare that murder which juries by their verdicts have as perseveringly\r\nregarded as justifiable homicide. In vain have eloquent counsel risen to\r\nprove that the prisoner bore his antagonist no ill-will; that he did not\r\n'wickedly and maliciously' challenge his victim to fight; that he had\r\nrecourse to the sole means within his power to right himself with the\r\nworld; that society would have branded him eternally for a coward had he\r\nheld back; that he took up his weapon in self-defence precisely as a man\r\nlevels his gun at the house-breaker or the midnight assassin;--the\r\nexpounder of the law has still been proof against sophistry which, once\r\naccepted, must tend inevitably to social disorganization. The\r\n_deliberate resolution_ to kill a fellow-creature has nothing to do with\r\nself-defence. To destroy another in cold blood is murder in the sight of\r\nthe law, and can assume no other aspect. But what availed it that the\r\njudge stood firm by the statute, when juries as pertinaciously backed\r\nthe sentiment of the world and refused the law permission to take its\r\ncourse? It availed much. The unseemly conflict has been carried on until\r\nat length civilization has become shocked by the spectacle. The effect\r\nof the ever-recurring encounter is something worse than ridiculous. It\r\nhas taken years to bring us to our senses, but we are rational at last.\r\nPublic opinion exercises its good sense, and since it cannot bring the\r\nlaw into harmony with its desperate folly, deems it expedient to shape\r\nits own views in conformity with unbending law. To slay in a duel is to\r\ncommit murder, though men do not hang for the crime. To be a murderer\r\nwith benefit of clergy is but an odious and irksome privilege after all!\r\n\r\n\"Sir Alexander was the eldest son of Dr. Johnson's Boswell. The\r\ninimitable biographer was fortunate in his offspring. His sons inherited\r\nall the virtues of their father, and none of his foibles. The social\r\ngood humor, the cleverness, the appreciation of learning, the\r\njoviality,--every good quality, in fact, of Bozzy was reflected in his\r\nchildren, who had the sense to discern and avoid the frailties that had\r\nrendered the sire ridiculous in his own day, and illustrious for all\r\ntime. James Boswell, the youngest son of the biographer, an accomplished\r\nscholar, superintended several editions of his father's great work, and\r\nwas held in high esteem by his contemporaries. He was a Commissioner of\r\nBankrupts when he suddenly died in London, in the prime of life, on the\r\n24th day of February, 1822. Sir Alexander, who had been created a\r\nbaronet in 1821, attended his brother's funeral in London, and returned\r\nto Scotland to meet his own death immediately afterwards. Sir Walter\r\nScott, warmly attached to both, was, we are informed, much affected by\r\nthe unexpected death of the baronet, who had dined with the novelist\r\nonly two or three days before the catastrophe, and, as usual, had been\r\nthe life and soul of the party assembled. 'That evening,' writes Mr.\r\nLockhart, 'was, I think, the gayest I ever spent in Castle-street; and\r\nthough Charles Matthews was present and in his best force, poor\r\nBoswell's songs, jokes and anecdotes had exhibited no symptom of\r\neclipse.' Four years afterwards Sir Walter dined in company with Charles\r\nMatthews again. The event is commemorated by a singular and\r\ncharacteristic entry in Scott's Diary. 'There have been odd\r\nassociations,' he writes, 'attending my two last meetings with Matthews.\r\nThe last time I saw him before yesterday evening, he dined with me in\r\ncompany with poor Sir Alexander Boswell, who was killed within a week.\r\nI never saw Sir Alexander more. The time before was in 1815, when John\r\nScott, of Gala, and I, were returning from France, and passed through\r\nLondon, when we brought Matthews down as far as Leamington. Poor Byron\r\nlunched, or rather made an early dinner with us at Long's, and a most\r\nbrilliant day we had of it. I never saw Byron so full of fun, frolic,\r\nwit, and whim; he was as playful as a kitten. Well, I never saw him\r\nagain. So this man of mirth has brought me no luck.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir Alexander had made the final arrangements for his duel the very day\r\nhe dined with Sir Walter. The circumstance in no way interfered with the\r\nflow of spirits of a man who had, indeed, invited a violent death by\r\nnothing more criminal than an over indulgence of ill-directed mirth. The\r\ndetails of the duel are of the usual kind. In the early part of 1821, a\r\nnewspaper called the _Beacon_, destined not to survive the year, was set\r\nup in Edinburgh in the Tory interest. The object of the publication was\r\nto counteract the effect of Radical doctrines, which were making great\r\nway in the northern metropolis under favor of the agitation that had\r\nbeen set up on behalf of Queen Caroline. Sir Walter Scott himself had\r\nbeen consulted upon the propriety of establishing the journal, and had\r\noffered with others to help it by a gift of money at starting. The\r\n_Beacon_ served any purpose but that of directing the public mind in the\r\npath desired. The management of the paper, with which by the way the law\r\nofficers of the Crown foolishly connected themselves, was in all\r\nrespects disastrous. The proprietors shrank from the responsibility\r\nwhich the bitter invective and satire of the more youthful and\r\nunscrupulous editors hourly accumulated on their shoulders; the articles\r\nof the paper were made the subject of Parliamentary discussion; and to\r\navoid consequences which it was not difficult to anticipate, the\r\nconcern, which had opened with flying colors in January, was suddenly\r\nand ignominiously shut up for ever in August.\r\n\r\n\"Glasgow took up the weapon which Edinburgh dropped. A newspaper\r\nappeared in the former city as the avowed defender of the cause and\r\nassailant of the persons previously upheld and attacked by the defunct\r\nEdinburgh journal. The _Sentinel_, as the Glasgow paper was called,\r\nwould hold his ground though the _Beacon_ was put out. It is much easier\r\nto bequeath hatred and rancor than to communicate talent and genius. The\r\n_Sentinel_ was abusive and licentious enough, but it had little to\r\nrecommend it on the score of ability. The _Beacon_ had made a personal\r\nattack upon Mr. Stuart, a gentleman connected with some leading Whig\r\nfamilies, and the _Sentinel_, in pursuance of its vocation, fastened\r\nupon the same luckless gentleman. The libel of the Edinburgh journalist\r\nhad been arranged. Mr. Stuart found out its author, and libeller and\r\nlibelled were prevented from doing further mischief by being bound over\r\nto keep the peace. To keep the peace, however, in those days was to be\r\nwanting in the very first element of chivalry, and, accordingly, Mr.\r\nStuart was pronounced by the _Sentinel_ a 'bully,' a 'coward,' a\r\n'dastard,' and a 'sulky poltroon.' Furthermore, he was 'a heartless\r\nruffian,' 'a white feather,' and 'afraid of lead.' To vindicate his\r\ncharacter Mr. Stuart raised an action of damages, and, curiously enough,\r\nhe was twitted in the very court of justice to which he appealed for\r\nprotection, for not having recourse to the hostile measure which in his\r\ndespair he at last adopted, and for pursuing which he was tried for his\r\nlife. Abuse went on in spite of the action of damages; Mr. Stuart\r\nfinally addressed himself to the agent for the printer of the newspaper,\r\nand the agent gave up the manuscripts from which the libels had been\r\nprinted. Mr. Stuart went to Glasgow to inspect them. He discovered his\r\nassailant. The author of the worst calumnies against him was Sir\r\nAlexander Boswell, 'a gentleman with whom he was somewhat related, and\r\nwith whom he had never been but upon good terms.' Mr. Stuart appealed to\r\na friend. He called in the advice of the Earl of Roslyn, who obtained an\r\ninterview with Sir Alexander Boswell, to whom he submitted two\r\npropositions. One was, that the baronet should deny that the calumnies\r\nwere his; the other, that Sir Alexander should confess that the libel\r\nwas but a poor joke, for which he was sorry. 'I will neither deny nor\r\nmake apology,' answered Sir Alexander.\r\n\r\n\"A duel was now a matter of course. Sir Alexander left a paper behind\r\nhim, confessing that the meeting was inevitable, and Mr. Stuart made all\r\nhis preparations for death. One stands amazed in the presence of such\r\nhorrible play, such terrific childishness. The parties met; they fired\r\ntogether, and Sir Alexander fell. Boswell, who would not allow that he\r\nhad written a squib, proudly fired in the air; Mr. Stuart took no aim,\r\nand yet killed his man. When the deed was done, the murderer, frantic,\r\nand 'dissolved in all the tenderness of an infant,' reproached himself\r\nwith exquisite simplicity that he had not taken aim, '_for if he had, he\r\nwas certain he would have missed him!_' whilst the dying man expressed a\r\ncorresponding anxiety lest 'he had not made his fire in the air appear\r\nso decided as he could have wished.' So men speak and act who take leave\r\nof their reason to play the fool in the high court of honor! A line\r\ntells the rest of the history. Sir Alexander is removed from the field\r\nand taken to the house of a friend. Mr. Stuart flies to the house of his\r\nfriend, runs into a room, shuts the door, sits down in agony of mind,\r\nand bursts into tears. In due time he is put on his trial for murder,\r\nthe jury unanimously find him _Not Guilty_, and Lord Chief Justice Clerk\r\ncongratulates him on the verdict, although five minutes before he had\r\ndeliberately stated that 'duels are but illustrious murders,' and that\r\n'no false punctilio or notion of honor can vindicate an act which\r\nterminates fatally to another fellow-creature.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATE DR. TROOST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe recently noticed the death of the excentric German professor, Dr.\r\nTroost, of Tennessee. His passion for all animals of the serpent kind\r\nwas well known, and we find it illustrated in this anecdote, related by\r\nSir Charles Lyell:\r\n\r\n\"Every thing of the serpent kind he has a particular fancy for, and has\r\nalways a number of them--that he has tamed--in his pockets or under his\r\nwaistcoat. To loll back in his rocking-chair, to talk about geology, and\r\npat the head of a large snake, when twining itself about his neck, is to\r\nhim supreme felicity. Every year in the vacation he makes an excursion\r\nto the hills, and I was told that, upon one of these occasions, being\r\ntaken up by the stage-coach, which had several members of Congress in it\r\ngoing to Washington, the learned Doctor took his seat on the top with a\r\nlarge basket, the lid of which was not over and above well secured. Near\r\nto this basket sat a Baptist preacher on his way to a great public\r\nimmersion. His reverence, awakening from a reverie he had fallen into,\r\nbeheld to his unutterable horror two rattlesnakes raise their fearful\r\nheads out of the basket, and immediately precipitated himself upon the\r\ndriver, who, almost knocked off his seat, no sooner became apprised of\r\nthe character of his ophidian outside passengers, than he jumped upon\r\nthe ground with the reins in his hands, and was followed instanter by\r\nthe preacher. The 'insides,' as soon as they learned what was going on,\r\nimmediately became outsides, and nobody was left but the Doctor and his\r\nrattlesnakes on the top. But the Doctor, not entering into the general\r\nalarm, quietly placed his greatcoat over the basket, and tied it down\r\nwith his handkerchief, which, when he had done, he said, 'Gendlemen,\r\nonly don't let dese poor dings pite you, and day won't hoort you.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME DACIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe husband of this celebrated woman (Andre Dacier) was born at Castres\r\nin 1651, and studied at Saumur, under Tanneguy le Fevre, whose daughter\r\nAnne he married in 1683. Both the husband and wife became eminent among\r\nthe classical scholars of the seventeenth century. They were employed\r\nwith others to comment upon and edit a series of the ancient authors,\r\nfor the Dauphin, which form the collection \"Ad usum Delphini.\" Madame\r\nDacier's commentaries are considered as superior to those of her\r\nhusband. She edited \"Callimachus,\" \"Florus,\" \"Aurelius Victor,\"\r\n\"Etropius,\" and the history which goes by the name of \"Dictys\r\nCretensis,\" all of which have been repeatedly reprinted, with her notes.\r\nShe published French translations of the \"Amphitryon,\" \"Rudens,\" and\r\n\"Lepidicus,\" of Plautus, with a good preface, of the comedies of\r\nTerence, of the \"Plutus,\" and \"The Clouds,\" of Aristophanes, and of\r\nAnacreon and Sappho. She also translated the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey,\"\r\nwith a preface and notes. This led to a controversy between her and La\r\nMotte, who had spoken slightingly of Homer. Madame Dacier wrote, in\r\n1714, \"Considerations sur les Causes de la Corruption du Gout,\" in which\r\nshe defended the cause of Homer with great vivacity, as she did also\r\nagainst Father Hardouin, who had written an \"Apology of Homer,\" which\r\nwas more a censure than an apology. The warmth, however, with which both\r\nthe Daciers resented any thing that was said against the ancient writers\r\nwas carried to the extreme, and had, at times, something ludicrous in\r\nit. But Madame Dacier's enthusiasm was real, and unaccompanied by\r\npedantry or conceit. She died in 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY.\r\n\r\nBY ALFRED B. STREET.\r\n\r\n    In changeless green, and grasping close the rock,\r\n      Up towers the mountain pine. The Winter blast\r\n      May like an ocean surge be on it cast;\r\n    Proud doth it stand, and stern defy the shock,\r\n      Unchanged in verdure and unbroke in crest,\r\n      Although wild throes may agitate its breast,\r\n    And clinging closer when the storm is gone,\r\n    Tired, but unbent upon its granite throne,\r\n    Not always doth it wrestle with the storm!\r\n      Skies smile; spring flowers make soft its iron roots;\r\n    Its sturdy boughs are kissed by breezes warm;\r\n      And birds gleam in and out with joyous flutes.\r\n    Duty proves not its strength unless defied,\r\n    But pleasure has it, too, bright as have hearts untried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SOUNDS FROM HOME.\"\r\n\r\nBY ALICE B. NEAL.\r\n\r\n    Last night I dreamed of thee, beloved!\r\n      I held that tiny hand,--\r\n    Encircled by my clasping arm\r\n      Once more I saw thee stand,--\r\n    The blush so faint, yet fairly traced,\r\n      Rose to thy changing cheek--\r\n    As when upon thy brows were placed\r\n      Farewells I could not speak.\r\n\r\n    Thine eyes were filled with softened light,\r\n      But welcomes now I read,\r\n    As to my heart, by love's fond sight.\r\n      I gently drew thy head;\r\n    And oh, so eloquent were they--\r\n      So full of earnest truth,--\r\n    I knew what fain thy heart would say,\r\n      The promise of thy youth.\r\n\r\n    I knew that thou hadst faithful been\r\n      To vows of long ago:\r\n    That speeding time, and changing scene,\r\n      No change in thee could show,\r\n    That absence had but bound thy love\r\n      More firmly to its choice--\r\n    It needed not one word to prove,\r\n      One sound of thy loved voice.\r\n\r\n    Yes, silent was that long embrace,\r\n      Though tears flowed fast and free.\r\n    As gazing down in that dear face,\r\n      I read thy love for me;\r\n    And thought of all the lonely hours\r\n      When I had wildly yearned\r\n    To press thee thus unto my heart,\r\n      And feel my kiss returned.\r\n\r\n    Those midnight hours! by sea and land!\r\n      How heavily they sped!\r\n    Sometimes upon a surf-beat strand\r\n      My weary feet would tread,\r\n    And when the stars looked calmly down\r\n      From cloudless foreign skies--\r\n    Their soft light seemed a radiance thrown\r\n      From these pure, earnest eyes.\r\n\r\n    'Twas but a dream! the light breeze swept\r\n      Soft touches o'er my brow;\r\n    The spray's cold kiss my lips had met,\r\n      Oh, still afar art thou!\r\n    'Twas but a dream! and yet I heard\r\n      Thy murmured--\"_Art_ thou come!\"--\r\n    Then woke, to feel my spirit stirred\r\n      With these dear \"sounds from home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCANDALOUS DANCES.\r\n\r\nBROUGHT FROM FRENCH CASINOS TO AMERICAN PARLORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have constantly reflected in our \"good society\" and \"fashionable\r\nworld\" every baseness and vulgarity that is invented _outre mer_,\r\nparticularly in Paris. One woman returns to smoke cigars, in a\r\nmagnificent home erected by a lucky mechanic or shopkeeper, as if such\r\nan indecency had ever been tolerated among the well-born and well-bred\r\npeople of the social metropolis. Others, copying from their probable\r\nassociates abroad, introduce obscene dances, and other licentious\r\namusements, which for a season have baffled the police of foreign\r\ncities, and boast of their superiority to \"low prejudices.\" All the\r\ntravelled readers of the _International_, except clerks, agents,\r\n_chevaliers d'industrie_, and fugitives from justice, know very well\r\nthat in all the world there is a show at least of moral where there is\r\nreal social elevation; that these abuses are not anywhere tolerated\r\namong families which have kept their carriages for three generations.\r\nBut we proposed an introduction to a passage written from Paris to the\r\nmost aristocratic of the London magazines:--\r\n\r\n\"A new species of dancing, unknown to the Alberts, the Anatoles, the\r\nBrocards, the Hullins, the Pauls, and the Noblets, has come into vogue\r\nat the Jardin Mabille, and at the Grande Chaumiere, situated on the\r\nBoulevard du Mont Parnasse, not far from the Barriere d'Enfer. This\r\ndance is called the _Cancan_ and the _Chahut_. It is unlike the waltz,\r\nthe gavotte, the country dance, the Scotch reel, the Spanish Cachucha,\r\nthe Hungarian mazurka; is far worse than jota Arragonese, or the most\r\nlascivious of Spanish dances of Andalusia. You may remember that in the\r\nearly days of Charles X. the police of Paris attempted and succeeded in\r\nputting down gross and immodest dances; but under the reign of Louis\r\nPhilippe the spirit of libertinage and _degingandage_, to use a French\r\nterm, again broke out among the class of _debardeurs_, and towards the\r\nclose of 1845 became terrific to behold. You, who know me well, are\r\naware that I am the last person in the world who would seek to put an\r\nend to any innocent amusement, or who would contend that the French\r\npeople should not dance. They have always danced, and will always dance,\r\nto the end of time. They danced under Saint Louis, under Henry IV.,\r\nunder Louis XIV., under Napoleon, and why should not they dance now?\r\nThere is no reason in the world why they should not dance, if in dancing\r\nthey do not shock public modesty, and offend against public decorum. In\r\nthe time of Louis XIV. there were public dances at the Moulin de\r\nJavelle; in the time of Napoleon there were dances in the Rue Coquenard,\r\nand at the Porcherons, near the Rue St. Lazar. In the time of Louis\r\nXVIII. and Charles X. there were dances at the Jardin de Tivoli. But at\r\nnone of these were decency outraged or morality shocked. At Tivoli, the\r\nnational pastime was indulged with decency and decorum, and although the\r\nprice on entering was so low as fifteen sous with a ticket, and thirty\r\nsous without a ticket, and albeit the dancers were chiefly of the\r\nhumbler classes, yet, I repeat, in 1827, 1828, and 1829, public decency\r\nwas not shocked. But from the _bal masque_ of the Theatre des Varietes\r\nin 1831, when, towards the close of the evening the lights were put out,\r\nand the _ronde infernale_ was commenced, obscene and disgusting dances\r\nwere becoming more and more common in Paris, and continued to make\r\nprogress till February, 1848. They had attained the most unenviable\r\nnotoriety in 1845, when at the Bal Mabille a dance was introduced called\r\n\"La Reine Pomare.\" Then there was the \"Cancan Eccentrique,\" introduced\r\nby a personage called \"La Princesse de Mogador,\" a feigned name, as you\r\nmay suppose, assumed by some _fille perdue_. These dances, commenced at\r\nthe Chaumiere and the Bal Mabille, were also introduced at the Bal\r\nMontesquieu, at the Bal de la Cite d'Antin, and, if I mistake not, at\r\nthe Bal Valentino. The principal performers were students in law, in\r\nmedicine, in pharmacy, clerks, commis voyageurs, profligate tradesmen,\r\nand lorettes, grisettes, _et filles de basse condition_.\r\n\r\n\"I must do the Provisional Government, so much abused, the justice to\r\nsay, that towards the close of 1848, when these disgusting dances were\r\nagain revived, the Gardiens de Paris interfered, and proceeded to clear\r\nthe room if they were persevered in. If this had been done in 1845 and\r\n1846 by that austere minister, who so much boasted of his independence\r\nand morality, events might have taken a different turn. But it is now\r\ntoo late to speculate, and it is easy to be wise after the event. But M.\r\nGuizot, his prefet de police, and the members of the Government, were\r\nwarned long before 1845-6 of the profound immorality and indecency of\r\nthese dances, and they made no effort to put a stop to them. It is\r\nbecause these scandals are now in a course of revival that I advert to\r\nthis matter at such length. The subject is worthy the attention of M.\r\nCarlier, the Prefet of Police, and of wiser heads than M. Carlier.\r\n\"_Selon qu'il est conduit_,\" said Richelieu, and he knew his nation\r\nwell; \"_Selon qu'il est conduit le peuple Francais est capable de\r\ntout._\" I am no enemy of innocent recreation, as you are well aware, or\r\nof harmless, convivial, social, or saltatory enjoyment. But if\r\nlasciviousness, obscenity, or _des saletes_ be tolerated in public\r\nplaces, a blow is struck at the very foundations of society. I may not,\r\neven in a letter, enter into a minute description of these dances.\r\nSuffice it to say, they would not be endured in England, even by women\r\nwho had fallen from the paths of virtue, unless their minds and hearts\r\nwere wholly debauched. You see, after so much light gossip, I end with a\r\nsermon--a sermon which the least strait-laced would preach under the\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEATRICAL CRITICISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following dramatic bulletin which appeared in a Dublin newspaper on\r\nthe first appearance of the celebrated Mrs. Siddons in that city, is\r\nquite as good a critique and as free from blunders, as some which have\r\nappeared in our own journals more recently:--\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday, May 30, 1784, Mrs. Siddons, about whom all the world has\r\nbeen talking, exposed her beautiful, adamantine, soft and lovely person\r\nfor the first time, at the Smock Alley Theatre, in the bewitching,\r\ntearful, and all melting character of Isabella. From the repeated\r\npanegyrics in the impartial London newspapers, we were taught to expect\r\nthe sight of a heavenly angel; but how were we supernaturally surprised\r\ninto the most awful joy at beholding a mortal goddess. The house was\r\ncrowded with hundreds more than it could hold--with thousands of\r\nadmiring spectators who went away without obtaining a sight. This\r\nextraordinary phenomenon of tragic excellence! this star of Melpomene!\r\nthis comet of the stage! this sun in the firmament of the muses! this\r\nmoon of blank verse! this queen and princess of tears! this Donellan of\r\nthe poisoned bowl! this empress of the pistol and dagger! this chaos of\r\nShakspeare! this world of weeping clouds! this Terpsichore of the\r\ncurtains and scenes! this Proserpine of fire and earthquake! this\r\nKatterfelto of wonders! exceeded expectation, went beyond belief, and\r\nsoared above all the natural powers of description! she was nature\r\nitself! she was the most exquisite work of art! she was the very daisy,\r\nprimrose, tube rose, sweet-briar, furze blossom, gilliflower,\r\nwall-flower, cauliflower and rosemary! in short she was a bouquet of\r\nParnassus. Where expectation was raised so high, it was thought she\r\nwould be injured by her appearance; but it was the audience who were\r\ninjured--several of them fainted before the curtain was drawn up.\r\n\r\n\"When she came to the scene of parting with her wedding ring, ah! what a\r\nsight was there! The very fiddlers in the orchestra, albeit unused to\r\nthe melting mood, blubbered like hungry children crying for their bread\r\nand butter; and when the bell rang for music between the acts, the tears\r\nfell from the bassoon player's eyes in such plentiful showers that they\r\nchoked the finger stops; and making a spout of that instrument, poured\r\nin such torrents on the first fiddler's book, that, not seeing the\r\noverture was in two sharps, the leader of the band actually played in\r\none flat. But the sobs and sighs of the groaning audience, and the noise\r\nof cork drawing from the smelling bottles, prevented the mistakes\r\nbetween flats and sharps being discovered.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and nine ladies fainted, forty-six went into fits, and\r\nninety-five had strong hysterics! The world will hardly credit the\r\ntruth, when they are told that fourteen children, five women, one\r\nhundred tailors and six common councilmen were actually drowned in the\r\ninundation of tears that flowed from the galleries, the slips and the\r\nboxes, to increase the briny pond in the pit; the water was three feet\r\ndeep, and the people that were obliged to stand upon the benches, were,\r\nin that position, up to their ankles in tears!\r\n\r\n\"An act of parliament against her playing any more, will certainly\r\npass.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH GENERALS OF TO-DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA clever writer in _Fraser's Magazine_, dating at Paris, writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Of Changarnier I shall not say much. He is as taciturn as M. L. N.\r\nBonaparte, _et possede un grand talent pour le silence_. Changarnier is\r\na man of great nerve and energy, and is perfectly up to street warfare\r\nand to the management of the unruly Parisian population. He is popular\r\nwith the soldiery and with the higher officers. As to his having any\r\ndecided political opinions to which he would become a martyr, I don't\r\nbelieve a word of it. He wishes to preserve order, and to save France\r\nfrom anarchy; but, apart from this, would be guided by his personal\r\ninterests. If royalty, hereditary or elective, become the order of the\r\nday--not a very likely occurrence within two or three years--he would\r\nadjust himself to the national arrangement on the best terms, and throw\r\nhis sword into the scale that kicked the beam. But if the game of a\r\npresident is to be played for in 1852 and 1856, Changarnier may put\r\nforward his own pretensions, as, at heart, he has neither love nor\r\nreverence for the Tenth of December. In the event of a war, however,\r\nChangarnier is more likely to look to the highest command, in which he\r\nmight win the marshal's baton, and thus become still more important,\r\npersonally, professionally, and politically. Military men, more\r\nespecially of the African school, seem to allow that Changarnier\r\npossesses a rare combination of military qualities. Decision, energy,\r\nbravery, and the _coup d'oeil_, he exhibits in the highest degree; but\r\nhe is, on the other hand, wholly without civil talents. He is no orator,\r\nno speaker even, and seems to entertain as great a contempt for\r\n_ideologues_ and deliberative assemblies as Napoleon himself. If\r\nChangarnier were ever invested with supreme power, it would go hard, so\r\nfar as he was concerned, with the constitution and liberties of France.\"\r\n\r\nThere is in no country a more honorable, high-principled, and\r\nconscientious soldier than Cavaignac. Of all the men produced by the\r\nRevolution of 1848 (Lamartine and Dufaure were known as political men\r\nbefore), Cavaignac appears the most single-minded, honorable, and\r\nconscientious. Though a Republican _pur sang_, he yet rendered more\r\nimportant services to order in June, 1848, than any one of the\r\nModerates, Royalists, or Burgraves, or generals of order, or than all of\r\nthem together. It is significant that Cavaignac has openly declared to\r\nhis friends--indeed, under his hand, that he will not support the\r\ncandidature of Louis Napoleon, should he present himself in 1852, or\r\nbecome a party to any head of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nLamoriciere is, as a man and as a general, of infinite talent, and of\r\nbrilliant courage. He is a good man of business, a brilliant speaker,\r\nand certainly has carried himself as a public character with\r\nindependence and honor.\r\n\r\nBedeau is a general of very considerable literary and scientific\r\ntalents, and perhaps of higher attainments in his profession than any\r\nother of the generals of the African school; but he is said to be\r\ndeficient in energy, and unresolved, and of late he seems to be less\r\nthought of as a man of action than as an organizer and administrator. In\r\nthe event of a war, it is likely the four men I speak of will play\r\nbrilliant parts; and in civil affairs, it is possible, if not certain,\r\nthat a great part may be reserved for Cavaignac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PENN AND MACAULAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find in the London _Times_ a reviewal of Mr. Forster's \"Observations\r\non the Charges made in Mr. Macaulay's History of England against the\r\nCharacter of William Penn,\" and transfer it to these pages, as likely to\r\nbe not less interesting to Americans than to Englishmen, since Penn's\r\nname is most intimately connected with the history of this country. The\r\nbook reviewed has been republished in New-York by Mr. John Wiley.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Macaulay will not be likely to take offence at a comparison of his\r\nhistory with Burnet's, and certainly in one particular point the two\r\nproductions have been attended with remarkably similar effects. The\r\nnumber of historical writers and pamphleteers who were called into being\r\nby the honest Bishop's account of his own times was astonishing. Every\r\nchapter in his narrative created a literary antagonist, and the spirit\r\nthus called into being was really instrumental, to a very considerable\r\nextent, in changing the whole style and tone of English history. It is\r\ntoo early to predict a precisely similar issue of Mr. Macaulay's labors;\r\nbut things are certainly tending that way. There have been more\r\ndiscussions upon points of English history within the last twelve months\r\nthan have usually occurred in as many years. The social and political\r\ncondition of our ancestors, the motives of great acts, the characters of\r\ngreat men, and the general course of our national life for the last\r\ncentury and a half, have of late been perpetually brought before the\r\npublic, and seldom without instructive results. It is not, of course,\r\nevery joust which yields a respectable show, but Mr. Macaulay's shield\r\nhas been once or twice struck by antagonists who have shown a title to\r\nthe encounter, and one of these is now in the lists with the pamphlet\r\nspecified below.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Forster's challenge is on behalf of the personal character and\r\npolitical conduct of the famous William Penn--\"the arch-Quaker,\" whom he\r\nconceives Mr. Macaulay to have treated with an injustice which, if it\r\ndid not result from deliberate prejudice, was at all events chargeable\r\nto unbecoming negligence of inquiry. The cause thus asserted he defends\r\nin fifty pages of not unreasonable argument, and supports by the liberal\r\nquotation of accepted authorities. Unfortunately, the character of the\r\ncontroversy is such that it is almost impossible either to arbitrate\r\nconclusively between the parties or to convey an adequate idea of their\r\nrespective positions. Mr. Macaulay's fashion of writing, too, makes\r\nsadly against any minute or critical investigation of his resources or\r\nhis deductions. His habit is to throw off a single complete sketch of a\r\ncharacter or a transaction, and at the foot of it to quote altogether\r\nthe various authorities, from certain passages of which he derived the\r\nwarrant for his own several touches. By this means we are incapacitated\r\nfrom closely following his observations, and we can only infer, with\r\ngreater or less probability, what particular portion of a particular\r\nauthority served for the foundation of any particular statement. To some\r\nextent this method of proceeding is inseparable from Mr. Macaulay's\r\nstyle, and its obvious disadvantage must be set off against that\r\nbrilliancy and effect of the general picture which commands such\r\nuniversal admiration. Mr. Macaulay writes as it were from impressions.\r\nHe consults and peruses the original records of the times he is\r\ndescribing, and out of the general deductions thus instinctively drawn\r\nhis conception is formed. We believe this to be the best way of arriving\r\nat general truths, but it is a practice which greatly limits the\r\napplication of ordinary tests of accuracy. Indeed, in many portions of\r\nMr. Macaulay's history, a reader can do little more than compare his own\r\nprevious impressions of the facts and scenes described with the\r\nimpression of the writer who is describing them. Many of his\r\ndescriptions are compounded of such numerous and minute ingredients,\r\npicked here and there from such a variety of quarters, that they can\r\nonly be verified by a similar process to that in which they originated.\r\nA signal exemplification of our meaning will be found in his delineation\r\nof the character and position of the English clergy before the\r\nRevolution. We not only believe ourselves that this sketch is\r\nsubstantially correct, but we would even venture to say that the\r\nimpressions of well-informed and unprejudiced minds as to the general\r\ntruth would, in a majority of cases, coincide with our own. Yet of this\r\nwe are perfectly certain--that it would not only be possible but easy to\r\ncollect so many particular examples of a contrary tendency as would\r\nwholly bewilder the judgment of an ordinary reader. Mr. Macaulay, in\r\nfact, can too frequently only be judged by those who have followed, at\r\nhowever humble a distance, his own track of study. The temptations to\r\nthis kind of writing will be considerably weaker in the case of the\r\nvolumes which are yet to come, and we may there, perhaps, hope for a\r\nlittle more severity of quotation. Yet in the portraitures of\r\nindividual characters these inducements will still remain, nor can they\r\nbe very easily, or indeed very properly, overlooked.\r\n\r\n\"It is not enough to say that the character of an historical personage\r\nis to be drawn from the authentic record of his actions. No doubt it is\r\nso; but there are a thousand minute and almost indefinable suggestions,\r\narising from the perusal of these actions with all their circumstances,\r\nwhich will exercise a most material influence upon the judgment. The\r\nmotives, for instance, of an action, must be almost always matter of\r\nsurmise, and yet upon these surmises the conclusion will mainly depend.\r\nIt is to this cause we must attribute the contradiction which such\r\nconclusions occasionally exhibit, as in the conflicting characters drawn\r\nby various hands of Archbishop Cranmer, of General Monk, of James II.,\r\nor, as in the case before us, of William Penn. Nevertheless, Mr. Forster\r\ndoes supply us with some means of estimating the justice and accuracy of\r\nMr. Macaulay's decision; but as our limits preclude any thing like a\r\ncomparison of the two theories in detail, we must confine ourselves to\r\ncommunicating a general idea of the disputed points in continuation and\r\nillustration of what we have already premised.\r\n\r\n\"William Penn, the Quaker, as we need hardly state, passed the early\r\npart of his life under heavy persecutions on account of his religious\r\nopinions. In the resolute spirit of fortitude with which he sustained\r\nthese sufferings he gave utterance to many rigid and uncompromising\r\ndoctrines. Things then took a turn with him, and from a poor persecuted\r\npietist he became a close client of Royalty, and almost the chief of\r\ncourt favorites in an age of favoritism. That some of his sayings and\r\ndoings in these two strangely-contrasted scenes of his life should be a\r\nlittle contradictory is, to say the least, no matter of wonder. Mr.\r\nMacaulay, accordingly, giving him full credit for religious principle,\r\nbut not much for strength of mind, depicts the stubborn and fanatical\r\nQuaker of former days as having become in the reign of King James the\r\ncompliant and, though well-meaning, not over-scrupulous agent of a\r\nmonarch, whose designs were directed against the civil and religious\r\nliberty of his people. Mr. Forster, on the other hand, would ascribe\r\nPenn's appearance in these scenes exclusively to his good and charitable\r\nintentions. He would represent him solely as a peacemaker (which is,\r\nperhaps, not far from the truth), and he would exculpate him from all\r\nmotives except those of charity; attributing to him a thorough and\r\nundisguised repugnance to the king's evil designs, and a resolution\r\nsimply to realize out of these evil doings the great and permanent\r\nblessing of religious liberty for his countrymen at large.\r\n\r\n\"The first bone of contention is the participation of Penn in that\r\nnefarious transaction by which the Royal Maids of Honor extorted ransoms\r\nfrom the poor Taunton girls who had welcomed the arrival of Monmouth. It\r\nseems that the chief, if not the sole authority for Mr. Macaulay's\r\nremarks on this head is contained in a letter of Sunderland's, preserved\r\nin the State-Paper office, and addressed to \"Mr. Penne.\" Mr. Forster,\r\ntherefore, disputes the identity of the two persons. Now, we think that\r\nvery few people, after a careful exercise of their judgment, would doubt\r\neither that this letter was addressed to Penn, or that another,\r\nsubsequently alluded to, was written by him. Still we admit that its\r\nphraseology does not bear out all Mr. Macaulay's circumstantial details\r\nof the transaction, and it certainly cannot be denied that his conduct\r\nwas, to say the least, _susceptible_ of an interpretation which should\r\nhave called rather for the approval than the censure of the historian.\r\nThe principal subject, however, of the controversy is the share taken by\r\nWilliam Penn in the dealings of James with the Fellows of Magdalen\r\nCollege, Oxford. We feel it very difficult to give any sufficient\r\nstatement of this case, not only by reason of our narrow limits, but for\r\nwant of words so to express ourselves as not to assume what one or other\r\nof the disputants deny. Yet Mr. Forster must not complain if we assert\r\nthat William Penn, in this as in other questionable transactions, was,\r\nif not an agent of the king, at least a kind of go-between, and\r\ngenerally with an inclination towards that conclusion which James\r\ndesired. Perhaps he often interfered because nobody else could interfere\r\nso beneficially--this we are very willing to allow, but, to take the\r\ncase now before us, it surely cannot be gainsayed that in his mediation,\r\nif Mr. Forster will accept the term, between the king and the college,\r\nhe really did wish that, with as little unpleasantness as might be, the\r\ncollege should submit to the king. And even if we accept as not proved\r\nthe allegation that he directly tempted the Fellows to perjury, yet Mr.\r\nForster must not ask us to believe that Penn would not have been a great\r\ndeal better pleased if the Fellows had quietly dropped the consideration\r\nof their oaths, and surrendered their foundation to the Papists without\r\nfurther struggle.\r\n\r\n\"We suspect the truth to be, that Mr. Macaulay has somewhat exceeded his\r\nspecified warrants, not in the design, but in the coloring. We believe\r\nthat many of Penn's acts were strangely inconsistent, if rigorously\r\nnoted, with his principles as previously professed, but we doubt whether\r\nthey will bear quite such hard words as Mr. Macaulay has given them.\r\nNevertheless, to recur to an expression which we employed before, we are\r\npersuaded that in a majority of cases the _general impression_ of an\r\nunbiassed inquirer would be more nearly in accordance with Mr.\r\nMacaulay's sketch than with that flattering and stainless portrait which\r\nMr. Forster, at the conclusion of his remarks, would fain have drawn.\r\nMr. Macaulay may have painted his story a little too highly. His faults\r\nare less in his verbs and substantives than in his adjectives and his\r\nadverbs. Penn never in all probability became such an obsequious and\r\npliant-principled courtier as he is represented in this history, but the\r\nsimple facts which are authentically recorded of his court-life preclude\r\nany notion of the high-souled and spotless character which Mr. Forster\r\nwould fain depict.\"\r\n\r\nThe subjects discussed in this volume have been much handled by our own\r\nwriters, and in several cases with very decided ability. We incline to\r\nthe side of Mr. Forster, throughout. An attentive study of the life of\r\nWilliam Penn reveals to our view a character of singular purity, and in\r\nnearly all respects admirably composed. The judgment of Macaulay we hold\r\nin very little esteem. It was said of Voltaire that he would sacrifice\r\nChrist for an epigram; it may be said of Macaulay that he would\r\nsacrifice as liberally for an antithesis. He labors always for effect,\r\nand it must be admitted that he has evinced very extraordinary abilities\r\nfor this end; he never fails in variety, contrast, or grouping; hence\r\nhis popularity, and the absence from his pictures of the highest\r\nelements of history.\r\n\r\nAlthough in State Papers and in the Transactions of Societies in this\r\ncountry, there is a large amount of important historical material in\r\nrelation to Penn, we have no creditable memoir of him; which is\r\nremarkable, considering the attractive interest of the subject, and the\r\njealousy which has been displayed in various quarters respecting every\r\nthing affecting his reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY WITHOUT A NAME.[17]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n_Continued from Page 216._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nThe two horsemen rode on their way. Neither spoke for several minutes.\r\nSir Philip Hastings pondering sternly on all that had passed, and his\r\nyounger companion gazing upon the scene around flooded with the\r\ndelicious rays of sunset, as if nothing had passed at all.\r\n\r\nSir Philip, as I have shown the reader, had a habit of brooding over any\r\nthing which excited much interest in his breast--nay more, of extracting\r\nfrom it, by a curious sort of alchemy, essence very different from its\r\napparent nature, sometimes bright, fine, and beneficial, and others dark\r\nand maleficient. The whole of the transaction just past disturbed him\r\nmuch; it puzzled him; it set his imagination running upon a thousand\r\ntracks, and most of them wrong ones; and thought was not willing to be\r\ncalled from her vagaries to deal with any other subject than that which\r\npreoccupied her.\r\n\r\nThe young stranger, on the other hand, seemed one of those characters\r\nwhich take all things much more lightly. In the moment of action, he had\r\nshown skill, resolution, and energy enough, but as he sat there on his\r\nhorse's back, looking round at every point of any interest to an admirer\r\nof nature with an easy, calm and unconcerned air, no one who saw him\r\ncould have conceived that he had been engaged the moment before in so\r\nfierce though short a struggle. There was none of the heat of the\r\ncombatant or the triumph of the victor in his air or countenance, and\r\nhis placid and equable expression of face contrasted strongly with the\r\ncloud which sat upon the brow of his companion.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, for my gloomy silence,\" said Sir Philip\r\nHastings, at length, conscious that his demeanor was not very courteous,\r\n\"but this affair troubles me. Besides certain relations which it bears\r\nto matters of private concernment, I am not satisfied as to how I should\r\ndeal with the ruffian we have suffered to depart so easily. His assault\r\nupon myself I do not choose to treat harshly; but the man is a terror to\r\nthe country round, committing many an act to which the law awards a very\r\ninsufficient punishment, but with cunning sufficient to keep within that\r\nline, the passage beyond which would enable society to purge itself of\r\nsuch a stain upon it; how to deal with him, I say, embarrasses me\r\ngreatly. I have committed him two or three times to prison already; and\r\nI am inclined to regret that I did not, on this occasion, when he was in\r\nthe very act of breaking the law, send my sword through him, and I\r\nshould have been well justified in doing so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, sir, methinks that would have been too much,\" replied his\r\ncompanion; \"he has had a fall, which, if I judge rightly, will be a\r\nsufficient punishment for his assault upon you. According to the very\r\n_lex talionis_, he has had what he deserves. If he has nearly broke your\r\narm, I think I have nearly broken his back.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not his punishment for any offence to myself, sir, I seek,\"\r\nreplied the baronet; \"it is a duty to society to free it from the load\r\nof such a man whenever he himself affords the opportunity of doing so.\r\nHerein the law would have justified me, but even had it not been so, I\r\ncan conceive many cases where it may be necessary for the benefit of our\r\ncountry and society to go beyond what the law will justify, and to make\r\nthe law for the necessity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brutus, and a few of his friends, did so,\" replied the young stranger\r\nwith a smile, \"and we admire them very much for so doing, but I am\r\nafraid we should hang them, nevertheless, if they were in a position to\r\ntry the thing over again. The illustration of the gibbet and the statue\r\nmight have more applications than one, for I sincerely believe, if we\r\ncould revive historical characters, we should almost in all cases erect\r\na gallows for those to whom we now raise a monument.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings turned and looked at him attentively, and saw his\r\nface was gay and smiling. \"You take all these things very lightly, sir,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"With a safe lightness,\" replied the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, with something more,\" rejoined his companion; \"in your short\r\nstruggle with that ruffian, you sprang upon him, and overthrew him like\r\na lion, with a fierce activity which I can hardly imagine really calmed\r\ndown so soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes it is, my dear sir,\" replied the stranger, \"I am somewhat of a\r\nstoic in all things. It is not necessary that rapidity of thought and\r\naction, in a moment of emergency, should go one line beyond the\r\noccasion, or sink one line deeper than the mere reason. The man who\r\nsuffers his heart to be fluttered, or his passions to be roused, by any\r\njust action he is called upon to do, is not a philosopher. Understand\r\nme, however; I do not at all pretend to be quite perfect in my\r\nphilosophy; but, at all events, I trust I schooled myself well enough\r\nnot to suffer a wrestling match with a contemptible animal like that, to\r\nmake my pulse beat a stroke quicker after the momentary effort is over.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings was charmed with the reply; for though it was a view\r\nof philosophy which he could not and did not follow, however much he\r\nmight agree to it, yet the course of reasoning and the sources of\r\nargument were so much akin to those he usually sought, that he fancied\r\nhe had at length found a man quite after his own heart. He chose to\r\nexpress no farther opinion upon the subject, however, till he had seen\r\nmore of his young companion; but that more he determined to see. In the\r\nmean time he easily changed the conversation, saying, \"You seemed to be\r\na very skilful and practised wrestler, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was brought up in Cornwall,\" replied the other, \"though not a Cornish\r\nman, and having no affinity even with the Terse and the Tees--an Anglo\r\nSaxon, I am proud to believe, for I look upon that race as the greatest\r\nwhich the world has yet produced.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, superior to the Roman?\" asked Sir Philip.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, even so,\" answered the stranger, \"with as much energy, as much\r\nresolution, less mobility, more perseverance, with many a quality which\r\nthe Roman did not possess. The Romans have left us many a fine lesson\r\nwhich we are capable of practising as well as they, while we can add\r\nmuch of which they had no notion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like much to discuss the subject with you more at large,\" said\r\nSir Philip Hastings, in reply; \"but I know not whether we have time\r\nsufficient to render it worth while to begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really hardly know, either,\" answered the young stranger; \"for, in\r\nthe first place, I am unacquainted with the country, and in the next\r\nplace, I know not how far you are going. My course tends towards a small\r\ntown called Hartwell--or, as I suspect it ought to be, Hartswell,\r\nprobably from some fountain at which hart and hind used to come and\r\ndrink.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going a little beyond it,\" replied Sir Philip Hastings, \"so that\r\nour journey will be for the next ten miles together;\" and with this good\r\nspace of time before him, the baronet endeavored to bring his young\r\ncompanion back to the subject which had been started, a very favorite\r\none with him at all times.\r\n\r\nBut the stranger seemed to have his hobbies as well as Sir Philip, and\r\nhaving dashed into etymology in regard to Hartwell, he pursued it with\r\nan avidity which excluded all other topics.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" he said, not in the least noticing Sir Philip's\r\ndissertation on Roman virtues--\"my own belief is, that there is not a\r\nproper name in England, except a few intruded upon us by the Normans,\r\nwhich might not easily be traced to accidental circumstances in the\r\nhistory of the family or the place. Thus, in the case of Aylesbury, or\r\nEaglestown, from which it is derived, depend upon it the place has been\r\nnoted as a resort for eagles in old times, coming thither probably for\r\nthe ducks peculiar to that place. Bristol, in Anglo Saxon, meaning the\r\nplace of a bridge, is very easily traceable; and Costa, or Costaford,\r\nmeaning in Anglo Saxon the tempter's ford, evidently derives its name\r\nfrom monk or maiden having met the enemy of man or womankind at that\r\nplace, and having had cause to rue the encounter. All the Hams, all the\r\nTons, and all the Sons, lead us at once to the origin of the name, to\r\nsay nothing of all the points of the compass, all the colors of the\r\nrainbow, and every trade that the ingenuity of man has contrived to\r\ninvent.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain Sir Philip Hastings for the next half hour endeavored to bring\r\nhim back to what he considered more important questions. He had\r\nevidently had enough of the Romans for the time being, and indulged\r\nhimself in a thousand fanciful speculations upon every other subject but\r\nthat, till Sir Philip, who at one time had rated his intellect very\r\nhighly, began to think him little better than a fool. Suddenly, however,\r\nas if from a sense of courtesy rather than inclination, the young man\r\nlet his older companion have his way in the choice of subject, and in\r\nhis replies showed such depth of thought, such a thorough acquaintance\r\nwith history, and such precise and definite views, that once more the\r\nbaronet changed his opinion, and said to himself, \"This is a fine and\r\nnoble intellect indeed, nearly spoiled by the infection of a corrupt and\r\nfrivolous world, but which might be reclaimed, if fortune would throw\r\nhim in the way of those whose principles have been fixed and tried.\"\r\n\r\nHe pondered upon the matter for some short time. It was now completely\r\ndark, and the town to which the stranger was going distant not a quarter\r\nof a mile. The little stars were looking out in the heavens, peering at\r\nman's actions like bright-eyed spies at night; but the moon had not\r\nrisen, and the only light upon the path was reflected from the flashing,\r\ndancing stream that ran along beside the road, seeming to gather up all\r\nthe strong rays from the air, and give them back again with interest.\r\n\r\n\"You are coming very near Hartwell,\" said Sir Philip, at length; \"but it\r\nis somewhat difficult to find from this road, and being but little out\r\nof my way, I will accompany you thither, and follow the high road\r\nonwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger was about to express his thanks, but the Baronet stopped\r\nhim, saying, \"Not in the least, my young friend. I am pleased with your\r\nconversation, and should be glad to cultivate your acquaintance if\r\nopportunity should serve. I am called Sir Philip Hastings, and shall be\r\nglad to see you at any time, if you are passing near my house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall certainly wait upon you, Sir Philip, if I stay any time in this\r\ncounty,\" replied the other. \"That, however, is uncertain, for I come\r\nhere merely on a matter of business, which may be settled in a few\r\nhours--indeed it ought to be so, for it seems to me very simple.\r\nHowever, it may detain me much longer, and then I shall not fail to take\r\nadvantage of your kind permission.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke gravely, and little more was said till they entered the small\r\ntown of Hartwell, about half through which a large gibbet-like bar was\r\nseen projecting from the front of a house, suspending a large board,\r\nupon which was painted a star. The light shining from the windows of an\r\nopposite house fell upon the symbol, and the stranger, drawing in his\r\nrein, said, \"Here is my inn, and I will now wish you good night, with\r\nmany thanks, Sir Philip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Methinks it is I should thank you,\" replied the Baronet, \"both for a\r\npleasant journey, and for the punishment you inflicted on the ruffian\r\nCutter.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the first,\" said the stranger, \"that has been more than repaid,\r\nif indeed it deserved thanks at all; and as for the other, that was a\r\npleasure in itself. There is a great satisfaction to me in breaking down\r\nthe self-confidence of one of these burly bruisers.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he dismounted, again wishing Sir Philip good night, and the\r\nlatter rode on upon his way. His meditations, as he went, were\r\naltogether upon the subject of the young stranger; for, as I have shown,\r\nSir Philip rarely suffered two ideas to get any strong grasp of his mind\r\nat the same time. He revolved, and weighed, and dissected every thing\r\nthe young man had said, and the conclusion that he came to was even more\r\nfavorable than at first. He seemed a man after his own heart, with just\r\nsufficient differences of opinion and diversities of character to make\r\nthe Baronet feel a hankering for some opportunity of moulding and\r\nmodelling him to his own standard of perfection. Who he could be, he\r\ncould not by any means divine. That he was a gentleman in manners and\r\ncharacter, there could be no doubt. That he was not rich, Sir Philip\r\nargued from the fact of his not having chosen the best inn in the little\r\ntown, and he might also conclude that he was of no very distinguished\r\nfamily, as he had not thought fit to mention his own name in return for\r\nthe Baronet's frank invitation.\r\n\r\nBusy with these thoughts Sir Philip rode on but slowly, and took nearly\r\nhalf an hour to reach the gates of Mrs. Hazleton's park, though they\r\nstood only two miles' distance from the town. He arrived before them at\r\nlength, however, and rang the bell. The lodge-keeper opened them but\r\nslowly, and putting his horse to a quicker pace, Sir Philip trotted up\r\nthe avenue towards the house. He had not reached it, however, when he\r\nheard the sound of horses feet behind him, and, as he was dismounting at\r\nthe door, his companion of the way rode quickly up and sprang to the\r\nground, saying, with a laugh--\r\n\r\n\"I find, Sir Philip, that we are both to enjoy the same quarters\r\nto-night, for, on my arrival at Hartwell, I did not expect to visit this\r\nhouse till to-morrow morning. Mrs. Hazelton, however, has very kindly\r\nhad my baggage brought up from the inn, and therefore I have no choice\r\nbut to intrude upon her to-night.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the doors of the house were thrown open, servants came forth\r\nto take the horses, and the two gentlemen were ushered at once into Mrs.\r\nHazleton's receiving-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was looking as beautiful as she had been at\r\ntwenty--perhaps more so; for the few last years before the process of\r\ndecay commences, sometimes adds rather than detracts from woman's\r\nloveliness. She was dressed with great skill and taste too; nay, even\r\nwith peculiar care. The hair, which had not yet even one silver thread\r\nin its wavy mass, was so arranged as to hide, in some degree, that\r\nheight and width of forehead which gave almost too intellectual an\r\nexpression to her countenance--which, upon some occasions, rendered the\r\nexpression (for the features were all feminine) more that of a man than\r\nthat of a woman. Her dress was very simple in appearance though costly\r\nin material; but it had been chosen and fitted by the nicest art, of\r\ncolors which best harmonized with her complexion, and in forms rather to\r\nindicate beauties than to display them.\r\n\r\nThus attired, with grace and dignity in every motion, she advanced to\r\nmeet Sir Philip Hastings, frankly holding out her hand to him, and\r\nbeaming on him one of her most lustrous smiles. It was all thrown away\r\nupon him indeed; but that did not matter. It had its effect in another\r\nquarter. She then turned to the younger gentleman with a greater degree\r\nof reserve in manner, but yet, as she spoke to him and welcomed him to\r\nher house, the color deepened on her cheek with a blush that would not\r\nhave been lost to Sir Philip if he had been at all in the custom of\r\nmaking use of them. They had evidently met before, but not often; and\r\nher words, \"Good evening, Mr. Marlow, I am glad to see you at my house\r\nat length,\" were said in the tone of one who was really glad, but did\r\nnot wish to show it too plainly.\r\n\r\n\"You have come with my friend, Sir Philip Hastings,\" she added; \"I did\r\nnot know you were acquainted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor were we, my dear madam, till this evening,\" replied the Baronet,\r\nspeaking for himself and his companion of the road, \"till we met by\r\naccident on the hill-side on our way hither. We had a somewhat\r\nunpleasant encounter with a notorious personage of the name of Tom\r\nCutter, which brought us first into acquaintance; though, till you\r\nuttered it, my young friend's name was unknown to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom Cutter! is that the man who poaches all my game?\" said the lady, in\r\na musing tone.\r\n\r\nNor was she musing of Tom Cutter, or the lost game, or of the sins and\r\niniquities of poaching; neither one or the other. The exclamation and\r\ninquiry taken together were only one of those little half-unconscious\r\nstratagems of human nature, by which we often seek to amuse the other\r\nparties in conversation--and sometimes amuse our own outward man\r\ntoo--while the little spirit within is busily occupied with some\r\nquestion which we do not wish our interlocutors to have any thing to do\r\nwith. She was asking herself, in fact, what had been the conversation\r\nwith which Sir Philip Hastings and Mr. Marlow had beguiled the\r\nway--whether they had talked of her--whether they had talked of her\r\naffairs--and how she could best get some information on the subject\r\nwithout seeming to seek it.\r\n\r\nShe soon had an opportunity of considering the matter more at leisure,\r\nfor Sir Philip Hastings, with some remark as to \"dusty dresses not being\r\nfit for ladies' drawing-rooms,\" retired for a time to the chamber\r\nprepared for him. The fair lady of the house detained Mr. Marlow indeed\r\nfor a few minutes, talking with him in a pleasant and gentle tone, and\r\nmaking her bright eyes do their best in the way of captivating. She\r\nexpressed regret that she had not seen him more frequently, and\r\nexpressed a hope, in very graceful terms, that even the painful\r\nquestion, which those troublesome men of law had started between them,\r\nmight be a means of ripening their acquaintance into friendship.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman replied with all gallantry, but with due discretion,\r\nand then retired to his room to change his dress. He certainly was a\r\nvery good-looking young man; finely formed, and with a pleasing though\r\nnot regularly handsome countenance; and perhaps he left Mrs. Hazleton\r\nother matters to meditate of than the topics of his conversation with\r\nSir Philip Hastings. Certain it is, that when the baronet returned very\r\nshortly after, he found his beautiful hostess in a profound reverie,\r\nfrom which his sudden entrance made her start with a bewildered look not\r\ncommon to her.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to talk to you for a few moments alone, my dear friend,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Hazleton, after a moment's pause. \"This Mr. Marlow is the\r\ngentleman who claims the very property on which you now stand;\" and she\r\nproceeded to give her hearer, partly by spontaneous explanations, partly\r\nby answers to his questions, her own view of the case between herself\r\nand Mr. Marlow; laboring hard and skilfully to prepossess the mind of\r\nSir Philip Hastings with a conviction of her rights as opposed to that\r\nof her young guest.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say, my dear madam,\" asked Sir Philip, \"that he claims\r\nthe whole of this large property? That would be a heavy blow indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, no,\" replied the lady; \"the great bulk of the property is\r\nmine beyond all doubt, but the land on which this house stands, and\r\nrather more than a thousand acres round it, was bought by my poor father\r\nbefore I was born, I believe, as affording the most eligible site for a\r\nmansion. He never liked the old house near your place, and built this\r\nfor himself. Mr. Marlow's lawyers now declare that his grand-uncle, who\r\nsold the land to my father, had no power to sell it; that the property\r\nwas strictly entailed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be easily ascertained,\" said Sir Philip Hastings; \"and I am\r\nafraid, my dear madam, if that should prove the case, you will have no\r\nremedy but to give up the property.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is not that very hard?\" asked Mrs. Hazleton, \"the Marlows certainly\r\nhad the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will make no difference,\" replied Sir Philip, musing; \"this young\r\nman's grand-uncle may have wronged your father; but he is not\r\nresponsible for the act, and I am very much afraid, moreover, that his\r\nclaim may not be limited to the property itself. Back rents, I suspect,\r\nmight be claimed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that is what my lawyer, Mr. Shanks, says,\" replied Mrs. Hazleton,\r\nwith a bewildered look; \"he tells me that if Mr. Marlow is successful in\r\nthe suit, I shall have to pay the whole of the rents of the land. But\r\nShanks added that he was quite certain of beating him if we could retain\r\nfor our counsel Sargeant Tutham and Mr. Doubledo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shanks is a rogue,\" said Sir Philip Hastings, in a calm, equable tone;\r\n\"and the two lawyers you have named bear the reputation of being learned\r\nand unscrupulous men. The first point, my dear madam, is to ascertain\r\nwhether this young gentleman's claim is just, and then to deal with him\r\nequitably, which, in the sense I affix to the term, may be somewhat\r\ndifferent from legal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really do not know what to do,\" cried Mrs. Hazleton, with a slight\r\nlaugh, as if at her own perplexity. \"I was never in such a situation in\r\nmy life;\" and then she added, very rapidly and in a jocular tone, as if\r\nshe were afraid of pausing upon or giving force to any one word, \"if my\r\npoor father had been alive, he would have settled it all after his own\r\nway soon enough. He was a great match-maker you know, Sir Philip, and he\r\nwould have proposed, in spite of all obstacles, a marriage between the\r\ntwo parties, to settle the affair by matrimony instead of by law,\" and\r\nshe laughed again as if the very idea was ridiculous.\r\n\r\nUnlearned Sir Philip thought so too, and most improperly replied, \"The\r\ndifference of age would of course put that out of the question;\" nor\r\nwhen he had committed the indiscretion, did he perceive the red spot\r\nwhich came upon Mrs. Hazleton's fair brow, and indicated sufficiently\r\nenough the effect his words had produced. There was an ominous silent\r\npause, however, for a minute, and then the Baronet was the person to\r\nresume the discourse in his usual calm, argumentative tone. \"I do not\r\nthink,\" he said, \"from Mr. Marlow's demeanor or conversation, that he is\r\nlikely to be very exacting in this matter. His claim, however, must be\r\nlooked to in the first place, before we admit any thing on your part. If\r\nthe property was really entailed, he has undoubtedly a right to it, both\r\nin honesty and in law; but methinks there he might limit his claim if\r\nhis sense of real equity be strong; but the entail must be made\r\nperfectly clear before you can admit so much as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, sir,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, hastily, for she heard a step on\r\nthe outer stairs, \"I will leave it entirely to you, Sir Philip, I am\r\nsure you will take good care of my interests.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip did not altogether like the word interests, and bowing his\r\nhead somewhat stiffly, he added, \"and of your honor, my dear madam.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton liked his words as little as he did hers, and she colored\r\nhighly. She made no reply, indeed, but his words that night were never\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThe next moment Mr. Marlow entered the room with a quiet, easy air,\r\nevidently quite unconscious of having been the subject of conversation.\r\nDuring the evening he paid every sort of polite attention to his fair\r\nhostess, and undoubtedly showed signs and symptoms of thinking her a\r\nvery beautiful and charming woman. Whatever was her game, take my word\r\nfor it, reader, she played it skilfully, and the very fact of her\r\nretiring early, at the very moment when she had made the most favorable\r\nimpression, leaving Sir Philip Hastings to entertain Mr. Marlow at\r\nsupper, was not without its calculation.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the lady was gone, Sir Philip turned to the topic of Mrs.\r\nHazleton's business with his young companion, and managed the matter\r\nmore skilfully than might have been expected. He simply told him that\r\nMrs. Hazleton had mentioned a claim made upon her estate by his lawyers,\r\nand had thought it better to leave the investigation of the affair to\r\nher friend, rather than to professional persons.\r\n\r\nA frank good-humored smile came upon Mr. Marlow's face at once. \"I am\r\nnot a rich man, Sir Philip,\" he said, \"and make no professions of\r\ngenerosity, but, at the same time, as my grand-uncle undoubtedly had\r\nthis money from Mrs. Hazleton's father, I should most likely never have\r\ntroubled her on the subject, but that this very estate is the original\r\nseat of our family, on which we can trace our ancestors back through\r\nmany centuries. The property was undoubtedly entailed, my father and my\r\nuncle were still living when it was sold, and performed no disentailing\r\nact whatever. This is perfectly susceptible of proof, and though my\r\nclaim may put Mrs. Hazleton to some inconvenience, I am anxious to avoid\r\nputting her to any pain. Now I have come down with a proposal which I\r\nconfidently trust you will think reasonable. Indeed, I expected to find\r\nher lawyer here rather than an independent friend, and I was assured\r\nthat my proposal would be accepted immediately, by persons who judged of\r\nmy rights more sanely perhaps than I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I hear what the proposal is?\" asked Sir Philip.\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly,\" replied Mr. Marlow, \"it is this: that in the first place\r\nMrs. Hazleton should appoint some gentleman of honor, either at the bar\r\nor not, as she may think fit, to investigate my claim, with myself or\r\nsome other gentleman on my part, with right to call in a third as umpire\r\nbetween them. I then propose that if my claim should be distinctly\r\nproved, Mrs. Hazleton should surrender to me the lands in question, I\r\nrepaying her the sum which my grand-uncle received, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said Sir Philip Hastings, \"are you aware that the law would not\r\noblige you to do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly,\" replied Mr. Marlow, \"and indeed I am not very sure that\r\nequity would require it either, for I do not know that my father ever\r\nreceived any benefit from the money paid to his uncle. He may have\r\nreceived a part however, without my knowing it, for I would rather err\r\non the right side than on the wrong. I then propose that the rents of\r\nthe estate, as shown by the leases, and fair interest upon the value of\r\nthe ground surrounding this house, should be computed during the time\r\nthat it has been out of our possession, while on the other hand the\r\nlegal interest of the money paid for the property should be calculated\r\nfor the same period, the smaller sum deducted from the larger, and the\r\nbalance paid by me to Mrs. Hazleton or by Mrs. Hazleton to me, so as to\r\nreplace every thing in the same state as if this unfortunate sale had\r\nnever taken place.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings mused without reply for more than one minute. That\r\nis a long time to muse, and many may be the thoughts and feelings which\r\npass through the breast of man during that space. They were many in the\r\npresent instance; and it would not be very easy to separate or define\r\nthem. Sir Philip thought of all the law would have granted to the young\r\nclaimant under the circumstances of the case: the whole property, all\r\nthe back rents, every improvement that had been made, the splendid\r\nmansion in which they were then standing, without the payment on his\r\npart of a penny: he compared these legal rights with what he now\r\nproposed, and he saw that he had indeed gone a great way on the generous\r\nside of equity. There was something very fine and noble in this conduct,\r\nsomething that harmonized well with his own heart and feelings. There\r\nwas no exaggeration, no romance about it: he spoke in the tone of a man\r\nof business doing a right thing well considered, and the Baronet was\r\nsatisfied in every respect but one. Mrs. Hazleton's words I must not say\r\nhad created a suspicion, but had suggested the idea that other feelings\r\nmight be acting between her and his young companion, notwithstanding the\r\ndifference of age which he had so bluntly pointed out, and he resolved\r\nto inquire farther.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, however, Mr. Marlow somewhat misinterpreted his\r\nsilence, and he added, after waiting longer than was pleasant, \"Of\r\ncourse you understand, Sir Philip, that if two or three honest men\r\ndecide that my case is unfounded--although I know that cannot be the\r\ncase--I agree to drop it at once and renounce it for ever. My solicitors\r\nand counsel in London judged the offer a fair one at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so do I,\" said Sir Philip Hastings, emphatically; \"however, I must\r\nspeak with Mrs. Hazleton upon the subject, and express my opinion to\r\nher. Pray, have you the papers regarding your claim with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have attested copies,\" replied Mr. Marlow, \"and I can bring them to\r\nyou in a moment. They are so unusually clear, and seem to put the matter\r\nso completely beyond all doubt, that I brought them down to satisfy Mrs.\r\nHazleton and her solicitor, without farther trouble, that my demand at\r\nleast had some foundation in justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe papers were immediately brought, and sitting down deliberately, Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings went through them with his young friend, carefully\r\nweighing every word. They left not even a doubt on his mind; they seemed\r\nnot to leave a chance even for the chicanery of the law, they were\r\nclear, precise, and definite. And the generosity of the young man's\r\noffer stood out even more conspicuously than before.\r\n\r\n\"For my part, I am completely satisfied,\" said Sir Philip Hastings, when\r\nhe had done the examination, \"and I have no doubt that Mrs. Hazleton\r\nwill be so likewise. She is an excellent and amiable person, as well as\r\na very beautiful woman. Have you known her long? have you seen her\r\noften?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only once, and that about a year ago,\" replied Mr. Marlow; \"she is\r\nindeed very beautiful as you say--for a woman of her period of life\r\nremarkably so; she puts me very much in mind of my mother, whom I in the\r\nconfidence of youthful affection used to call 'my everlasting.' I\r\nrecollect doing so only three days before the hand of death wrote upon\r\nher brow the vanity of all such earthly thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings was satisfied. There was nothing like passion there.\r\nUnobservant as he was in most things, he was more clear-sighted in\r\nregard to matters of love, than any other affection of the human mind.\r\nHe had himself loved deeply and intensely, and he had not forgotten it.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, before any thing could be concluded, to wait for Mrs.\r\nHazleton's rising on the following morning; and, bidding Mr. Marlow good\r\nnight with a warm grasp of the hand, Sir Philip Hastings retired to his\r\nroom and passed nearly an hour in thought, pondering the character of\r\nhis new acquaintance, recalling every trait he had remarked, and every\r\nword he had heard. It was a very satisfactory contemplation. He never\r\nremembered to have met with one who seemed so entirely a being after his\r\nown heart. There might be little flaws, little weaknesses perhaps, but\r\nthe confirming power of time and experience would, he thought,\r\nstrengthen all that was good, and counsel and example remedy all that\r\nwas weak or light.\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" thought the Baronet, \"his conduct on this occasion\r\nshows a noble and equitable spirit. We shall see how Mrs. Hazleton meets\r\nit to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nWhen that morrow came, he had to see the reverse of the picture, but it\r\nmust be reserved for another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was up in the morning early. She was at all times an early\r\nriser, for she well knew what a special conservator of beauty is the\r\nmorning dew, but on this occasion certain feelings of impatience made\r\nher a little earlier than usual. Besides, she knew that Sir Philip\r\nHastings was always a matutinal man, and would certainly be in the\r\nlibrary before she was down. Nor was she disappointed. There she found\r\nthe Baronet reaching up his hand to take down Livy, after having just\r\nreplaced Tacitus.\r\n\r\n\"It is a most extraordinary thing, my dear madam,\" said Sir Philip,\r\nafter the salutation of the morning, \"and puzzles me more than I can\r\nexplain.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton fancied that her friend had discovered some very knotty\r\npoint in the case with Mr. Marlow, and she rejoiced, for her object was\r\nnot to emulate but to entangle. Sir Philip, however, went on to put her\r\nout of all patience by saying, \"How the Romans, so sublimely virtuous at\r\none period of their history, could fall into so debased and corrupt a\r\nstate as we find described even by Sallust, and depicted in more\r\nfrightful colors still by the latter historians of the empire.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton, as I have said, was out of all patience, and ladies in\r\nthat state sometimes have recourse to homely illustration. \"Their virtue\r\ngot addled, I suppose,\" she replied, \"by too long keeping. Virtue is an\r\negg that won't bear sitting upon--but now do tell me, Sir Philip, had\r\nyou any conversation with Mr. Marlow last night upon this troublesome\r\naffair of mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had, my dear madam,\" replied Sir Philip, with a very faint smile, for\r\nSir Philip could not well bear any jesting on the Romans. \"I did not\r\nonly converse with Mr. Marlow on the subject, but I examined carefully\r\nthe papers he brought down with him, and perceived at once that you have\r\nnot the shadow of a title to the property in question.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton's brow grew dark, and she replied in a somewhat sullen\r\ntone, \"You decided against me very rapidly, Sir Philip. I hope you did\r\nnot let Mr. Marlow see your strong prepossession--opinion I mean to\r\nsay--in his favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely,\" replied Sir Philip Hastings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was silent, and gazed down upon the carpet as if she were\r\ncounting the threads of which it was composed, and finding the\r\ncalculation by no means satisfactory.\r\n\r\nSir Philip let her gaze on for some time, for he was not very easily\r\nmoved to compassion in cases where he saw dishonesty of purpose as well\r\nas suffering. At length, however, he said, \"My judgment is not binding\r\nupon you in the least; I tell you simply, my dear madam, what is my\r\nconclusion, and the law will tell you the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see,\" muttered Mrs. Hazleton between her teeth; but then\r\nputting on a softer air she asked, \"Tell me, Sir Philip, would you, if\r\nyou were in my situation, tamely give up a property which was honestly\r\nbought and paid for, without making one struggle to retain it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The moment I was convinced I had no legal right to it,\" replied Sir\r\nPhilip. \"However, the law is still open to you, if you think it better\r\nto resist; but before you take your determination, you had better hear\r\nwhat Mr. Marlow proposes, and you will pardon me for expressing to you\r\nwhat I did not express to him: an opinion that his proposal is founded\r\nupon the noblest view of equity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, with her eyes brightening, \"pray let me\r\nhear this proposal.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip explained it to her most distinctly, expecting that she would\r\nbe both surprised and pleased, and never doubted that she would accept\r\nit instantly. Whether she was surprised or not, did not appear, but\r\npleased she certainly was not to any great extent, for she did not wish\r\nthe matter to be so soon concluded. She began to make objections\r\nimmediately. \"The enormous expense of building this house has not been\r\ntaken into consideration at all, and it will be very necessary to have\r\nthe original papers examined before any thing is decided. There are two\r\nsides to every question, my dear Sir Philip, and we cannot tell that\r\nother papers may not be found, disentailing this estate before the sale\r\ntook place.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is impossible,\" answered Sir Philip Hastings, \"if the papers\r\nexhibited to me are genuine, for this young gentleman, on whom, as his\r\nfather's eldest son, the estate devolved by the entail, was not born\r\nwhen the sale took place. By his act only could it be disentailed, and\r\nas he was not born, he could perform no such act.\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hard in his cold way, and it galled her sorely.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they are not genuine,\" she said at length.\r\n\r\n\"They are all attested,\" replied Sir Philip, \"and he himself proposes\r\nthat the originals should be examined as the basis of the whole\r\ntransaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is absolutely necessary,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, well satisfied to\r\nput off decision even for a time. But Sir Philip would not leave her\r\neven that advantage.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he said, \"you must at once decide whether you accept his\r\nproposal, on condition that the examination of the papers proves the\r\njustice of his claim to the satisfaction of those you may appoint to\r\nexamine it. If there are any doubts and difficulties to be raised\r\nafterwards, he might as well proceed by law at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let him go to law,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hazleton with a flashing eye.\r\n\"If he do, I will defend every step to the utmost of my power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Incur enormous expense, give yourself infinite pain and mortification,\r\nand ruin a fine estate by a spirit of unnecessary and unjust\r\nresistance,\" added Sir Philip, in a calm and somewhat contemptuous tone.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Sir Philip, you press me too hard,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hazleton in\r\na tone of angry mortification, and, sitting down to the table, she\r\nactually wept.\r\n\r\n\"I only press you for your own good,\" answered the Baronet, not at all\r\nmoved, \"you are perhaps not aware that if this gentleman's claim is\r\njust, and you resist it, the whole costs will fall upon you. All that\r\ncould be expected of him was to submit his claim to arbitration, but he\r\nnow does more; he proposes, if arbitration pronounce it just, to make\r\nsacrifices of his legal rights to the amount of many thousand pounds. He\r\nis not bound to refund one penny paid for this estate, he is entitled to\r\nback rents for a considerable number of years, and yet he offers to\r\nrepay the money, and far from demanding the back rents, to make\r\ncompensation for any loss of interest that may have been sustained by\r\nthis investment. There are few men in England, let me tell you, who\r\nwould have made such a proposal, and if you refuse it you will never\r\nhave such another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not you think, Sir Philip,\" asked Mrs. Hazleton sharply, \"that he\r\nnever would have made such a proposal if he had not known there was\r\nsomething wrong about his title?\"\r\n\r\nNow there was something in this question which doubly provoked Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings. He never could endure a habit which some ladies have of\r\nrecurring continually to points previously disposed of, and covering the\r\nreiteration by merely putting objections in a new form. Now the question\r\nas to the validity of Mr. Marlow's title, he looked upon as entirely\r\ndisposed of by the proposal of investigation and arbitration. But there\r\nwas something more than this; the very question which the lady put\r\nshowed an incapacity for conceiving any generous motive, which\r\nthoroughly disgusted him, and, turning with a quiet step to the window,\r\nhe looked down upon the lawn which spread far away between two ranges of\r\ntall fine wood, glowing in the yellow sunshine of a dewy autumnal\r\nmorning. It was the most favorable thing he could have done for Mrs.\r\nHazleton. Even the finest and the strongest and the stoutest minds are\r\nmore frequently affected unconsciously by external things than any one\r\nis aware of. The sweet influences or the irritating effects of fine or\r\nbad weather, of beautiful or tame scenery, of small cares and petty\r\ndisappointments, of pleasant associations or unpleasant memories, nay of\r\na thousand accidental circumstances, and even fancies themselves, will\r\naffect considerations totally distinct and apart, as the blue or yellow\r\npanes of a stained glass window cast a melancholy hue or a yellow\r\nsplendor upon the statue and carvings of the cold gray stone.\r\n\r\nAs Sir Philip gazed forth upon the fair scene before his eyes, and\r\nthought what a lovely spot it was, how calm, how peaceful, how\r\nrefreshing in its influence, he said to himself, \"No wonder she is\r\nunwilling to part with it.\"\r\n\r\nThen again, there was a hare gambolling upon the lawn, at a distance of\r\nabout a hundred yards from the house, now scampering along and beating\r\nup the dew from the morning grass, now crouched nearly flat so as hardly\r\nto be seen among the tall green blades, then hopping quietly along with\r\nan awkward, shuffling gait, or sitting up on its hind legs, with raised\r\nears, listening to some distant sound; but still as it resumed its\r\ngambols, again going round and round, tracing upon the green sward a\r\nlabyrinth of meandering lines. Sir Philip watched it for several moments\r\nwith a faint smile, and then said to himself, \"It is the beast's\r\nnature--why not a woman's?\"\r\n\r\nTurning himself round he saw Mrs. Hazleton, sitting at the table with\r\nher head leaning in a melancholy attitude upon her hand, and he replied\r\nto her last words, though he had before fully made up his mind to give\r\nthem no answer whatever.\r\n\r\n\"The question in regard to title, my dear madam,\" he said, \"is one which\r\nis to be decided by others. Employ a competent person, and he will\r\ninsure, by full investigation, that your rights are maintained entire.\r\nYour acceptance of Mr. Marlow's proposals contingent on the full\r\nrecognition of his claim, will be far from prejudicing your case, should\r\nany flaw in your title be discovered. On the contrary, should the\r\ndecision of a point of law be required, it will put you well with the\r\ncourt. By frankly doing so, you also meet him in the same spirit in\r\nwhich I am sure he comes to you; and as I am certain he has a very high\r\nsense of equity, I think he will be well inclined to enter into any\r\narrangement which may be for your convenience. From what he has said\r\nhimself, I do not believe he can afford to keep such an establishment as\r\nis necessary for this house, and if you cling to it, as you may well do,\r\ndoubtless it may remain your habitation as long as you please at a very\r\nmoderate rent. Every other particular I think may be settled in the same\r\nmanner, if you will but show a spirit of conciliation, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I have done that,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, interrupting him.\r\n\"However, Sir Philip, I will leave it all to you. You must act for me in\r\nthis business. If you think it right, I will accept the proposal\r\nconditionally as you mention, and the title can be examined fully\r\nwhenever we can fix upon the time and the person. All this is very hard\r\nupon me, I do think; but I suppose I must submit with a good grace.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly the best plan,\" replied Sir Philip; and while Mrs.\r\nHazleton retired to efface the traces of tears from her eyelids, the\r\nBaronet walked into the drawing-room, where he was soon after joined by\r\nMr. Marlow. He merely told him, however, that he had conversed with the\r\nlady of the house, and that she would give him her answer in person.\r\nNow, whatever were Mrs. Hazleton's wishes or intentions, she certainly\r\nwas not well satisfied with the precise and rapid manner in which Sir\r\nPhilip brought matters of business to an end. His last words, however,\r\nhad afforded her a glimmering prospect of somewhat lengthy and frequent\r\ncommunication between herself and Mr. Marlow, and one thing is certain,\r\nthat she did not at all desire the transaction between them to be\r\nconcluded too briefly. At the same time, it was not her object to appear\r\notherwise than in the most favorable light to his eyes; and\r\nconsequently, when she entered the drawing-room she held out her hand to\r\nhim with a gracious though somewhat melancholy smile, saying, \"I have\r\nhad a long conversation with Sir Philip this morning, Mr. Marlow,\r\nconcerning the very painful business which brought you here. I agree at\r\nonce to your proposal in regard to the arbitration and the rest;\" and\r\nshe then went on to speak of the whole business as if she had made not\r\nthe slightest resistance whatever, but had been struck at once by the\r\nliberality of his proposals, and by the sense of equity which they\r\ndisplayed. Sir Philip took little notice of all this; for he had fallen\r\ninto one of his fits of musing, and Mr. Marlow had quitted the room to\r\nbring some of the papers for the purpose of showing them to Mrs.\r\nHazleton, before the Baronet awoke out of his reverie. The younger\r\ngentleman returned a moment after, and he and Sir Philip and Mrs.\r\nHazleton were busily looking at a long list of certificates of births,\r\ndeaths and marriages, when the door opened, and Mr. Shanks, the\r\nattorney, entered the room, booted, spurred, and dusty as if from a long\r\nride. He was a man to whom Sir Philip had a great objection; but he said\r\nnothing, and the attorney with a tripping step advanced towards Mrs.\r\nHazleton.\r\n\r\nThe lady looked confused and annoyed, and in a hasty manner put back the\r\npapers into Mr. Marlow's hand. But Mr. Shanks was one of the keen and\r\nobserving men of the world. He saw every thing about him as if he had\r\nbeen one of those insects which have I do not know how many thousand\r\npair of lenses in each eye. He had no scruples or hesitation either; he\r\nwas all sight and all remark, and a lady of any kind was not at all the\r\nperson to inspire him with reverence.\r\n\r\nHe was, in short, all law, and loved nothing, respected nothing, but\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Mrs. Hazleton,\" he exclaimed, \"I did not expect to find you so\r\nengaged. These seem to be law papers--very dangerous, indeed, madam, for\r\nunprofessional persons to meddle with such things. Permit me to look at\r\nthem;\" and he held out his hand towards Mr. Marlow, as if expecting to\r\nreceive the papers without a word of remonstrance. But Mr. Marlow held\r\nthem back, saying, in a very calm, civil tone, \"Excuse me, sir! We are\r\nconversing over the matter in a friendly manner; and I shall show them\r\nto a lawyer only at Mrs. Hazleton's request.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very improper--that is, I mean to say very unprofessional!\" exclaimed\r\nMr. Shanks, \"and let me say very hazardous too,\" rejoined the lawyer\r\nabruptly; but Mrs. Hazleton herself interposed, saying in a marked tone\r\nand with an air of dignity which did not always characterize her\r\ndemeanor towards her \"right hand man,\" as she was accustomed sometimes\r\nto designate Mr. Shanks, \"We do not desire any interference at this\r\nmoment, my good sir. I appointed you at twelve o'clock. It is not yet\r\nnine.\" \"O I can see, I can see,\" replied Mr. Shanks, while Sir Philip\r\nHastings advanced a step or two, \"his worship here never was a friend of\r\nmine, and has no objection to take a job or two out of my hands at any\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have nothing to do with jobs, sir,\" said Sir Philip Hastings, in his\r\nusual dry tone, \"but at all events we do not wish you to make a job\r\nwhere there is none.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must take the liberty, however, of warning that lady, sir,\" said Mr.\r\nShanks, with the pertinacity of a parrot, which he so greatly resembled,\r\n\"as her legal adviser, sir, that if----\"\r\n\r\n\"That if she sends for an attorney, she wants him at the time she\r\nappoints,\" interposed Sir Philip; \"that was what you were about to say,\r\nI suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir, not at all,\" exclaimed the lawyer; for very shrewd and\r\nvery oily lawyers will occasionally forget their caution and their\r\ncoolness when they see the prospect of a loss of fees before them. \"I\r\nwas going to say no such thing. I was going to warn her not to meddle\r\nwith matters of business of which she can understand nothing, by the\r\nadvice of those who know less, and who may have jobs of their own to\r\nsettle while they are meddling with hers.\" \"And I warn you to quit this\r\nroom, sir,\" said Sir Philip Hastings, a bright spot coming into his\r\nusually pale cheek; \"the lady has already expressed her opinion upon\r\nyour intrusion, and depend upon it, I will enforce mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do no such thing, sir, till I have fully----\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more, for before he could conclude the sentence, the hand of\r\nSir Philip Hastings was upon his collar with the grasp of a giant, and\r\nalthough he was a tall and somewhat powerful man, the Baronet dragged\r\nhim to the door in despite of his half-choking struggles, as a nurse\r\nwould haul along a baby, pulled him across the stone hall, and opening\r\nthe outer door with his left hand, shot him down the steps without any\r\nceremony; leaving him with his hands and knees upon the terrace.\r\n\r\nThis done, the Baronet returned into the house again, closing the door\r\nbehind him. He then paused in the hall for an instant, reproaching\r\nhimself for certain over-quick beatings of the heart, tranquillized his\r\nwhole look and demeanor, and then returning to the drawing-room, resumed\r\nthe conversation with Mrs. Hazleton, as if nothing had ever occurred to\r\ninterrupt it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was or affected to be a good deal flustered by the event\r\nwhich had just taken place, but after a number of certain graceful\r\nattitudes, assumed without the slightest appearance of affectation, she\r\nrecovered her calmness, and proceeded with the business in hand. That\r\nbusiness was soon terminated, so far as the full and entire acceptance\r\nof Mr. Marlow's proposal went, and immediately after the conclusion of\r\nbreakfast, Sir Philip Hastings ordered his horses to depart. Mrs.\r\nHazleton fain would have detained him, for she foresaw that his going\r\nmight be a signal for Mr. Marlow's going also, and it was not a part of\r\nher policy to assume the matronly character so distinctly as to invite\r\nhim to remain in her house alone. Sir Philip however was inexorable, and\r\nreturned to his own dwelling, renewing his invitation to his new\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton bade him adieu, with the greatest appearance of\r\ncordiality; but I am very much afraid, if one had possessed the power of\r\nlooking into her heart, one would have a picture very different from\r\nthat presented by her face. Sir Philip Hastings had said and done things\r\nsince he had entered her dwelling the night before, which Mrs. Hazleton\r\nwas not a woman to forget or forgive. He had thwarted her schemes, he\r\nhad mortified her vanity, he had wounded her pride; and she was one of\r\nthose women who bide their time, but have a strong tenacity of\r\nresentments.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, however, she played a new game with Mr. Marlow. She\r\ninsisted upon his remaining for the day, but with a fine sense of\r\nexternal proprieties, she informed him that she expected a charming\r\nelderly lady of her acquaintance to pass a few days with her, to whom\r\nshe should particularly like to introduce him.\r\n\r\nThis was false, be it remarked; but she immediately took measures to\r\nmake it true. Now, there is in every neighborhood more than one of that\r\nclass called good creatures. For this office, an abundant store of real\r\nor assumed soft stupidity is required; but it is a somewhat difficult\r\npart to play, for with this stupidity there must also be a considerable\r\nportion of fine tact, to guard the performer against any of those\r\nblunders into which good-natured people are continually plunging. Drill\r\nand discipline are also necessary, in order to be always on the look out\r\nfor hints, to appreciate them properly, to comprehend that friends may\r\nsay one thing and mean another, and to ask no questions of any kind.\r\nThere were no less than three of these good creatures in this Mrs.\r\nHazleton's immediate neighborhood; and during a few moments' retreat to\r\nher own little writing-room, she laid her finger upon her fair temple,\r\nand thought them well over. Mrs. Winifred Edgeby was the first who\r\nsuggested herself to the mind of the fair lady. She had many of the\r\nrequisites. She dressed well, talked well, and had an air of style and\r\nfashion about her; was perfectly innocuous, and skilful in divining the\r\npurposes and wishes of a friend or patron; but there was an occasional\r\ntouch of subacrid humor about her which Mrs. Hazleton did not half like.\r\nIt gave an impression of seeing too clearly, of perceiving much more\r\nthan she pretended to perceive.\r\n\r\nThe second was Mrs. Warmington, a widow, not very rich, and not indeed\r\nvery refined; gay, talkative, somewhat boisterous, yet full of a sound\r\ndiscretion in never committing herself or a friend. She had also much\r\nexperience, for she had been twice married, and twice a widow, and thus\r\nhad had her misfortunes. The third was a Miss Goodenough, the most\r\nsilent, quiet, stilly person in the world, moving about the house with\r\nthe step of a cat, and a face of infinite good nature to the whole human\r\nrace. She was to all appearance the pink of gentleness and weak good\r\nnature; but her silence was invaluable.\r\n\r\nAfter some consideration Mrs. Hazleton decided upon the widow, and\r\ninstantly dispatched a note with her own carriage, begging Mrs.\r\nWarmington to come over immediately and spend a few days with her, as a\r\nyoung gentleman had arrived upon a visit, and it would be indecorous to\r\nentertain him alone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Warmington understood it all in an instant. She said to herself,\r\n\"Ho, ho! a young gentleman come to stay!--wanted a duenna! Matrimony in\r\nthe wind! Heigho! she must be six and thirty--six and thirty from two\r\nand fifty leave sixteen points against me, and long odds. Well, well,--I\r\nhave had my share;\" and Mrs. Warmington laughed aloud. However, she\r\nwould neither keep Mrs. Hazleton's carriage waiting, nor Mrs. Hazleton\r\nherself in suspense, for there were various little comforts and\r\nconveniences in the good will of that lady which Mrs. Warmington was\r\neager to cultivate. She had, too, a shrewd suspicion that the enmity of\r\nMrs. Hazleton might become a thing to be seriously dreaded; and\r\ntherefore, whichever side of the question she looked at, she saw reasons\r\nfor seeking the beautiful widow's good graces. Her maid was called, her\r\nclothes packed up, and she entered the carriage and drove away, while in\r\nthe mean time Mrs. Hazleton had been expatiating to Mr. Marlow upon all\r\nthe high qualities and points of excellence in her friend Mrs.\r\nWarmington. She was too skilful, moreover, to bring her good taste and\r\njudgment into question with her young friend, by raising expectations\r\nwhich might be disappointed. She therefore threw in insinuations of a\r\nfew faults and failings in dear Madam Warmington's manner and demeanor.\r\nBut then she said she was such a good creature at heart, that although\r\nthe very fastidious affected to censure, she herself forgot all little\r\nblemishes in the inherent excellence of the person.\r\n\r\nMoreover, upon the plea of looking at the ground which was the subject\r\nof Mr. Marlow's claim, she led him out for a long, pleasant ramble\r\nthrough the park. She took him amongst old hawthorn trees, through\r\ngroves of chestnuts by the banks of the stream, and along paths where\r\nthe warm sunshine played through the brown and yellow leaves above,\r\ngilding their companions which had fallen earlier than themselves to the\r\nsward below. It was a very lover-like walk indeed--one where nature\r\nspeaks to the heart, wakening sweet influences, and charming the spirit\r\nup from hard and cold indifference. Mrs. Hazleton felt sure that Mr.\r\nMarlow would not forget that walk, and she took care to impress it as\r\ndeeply as possible upon his memory. Nor did she want any of the means to\r\ndo so. Her mind was highly cultivated for the age in which she lived,\r\nher taste fine, her information extensive. She could discourse of\r\nforeign lands, of objects and scenes of deep interest, great beauty, and\r\nrich associations,--of courts and cities far away, of music, painting,\r\nflowers in other lands, of climates rich in sunshine and of genial\r\nwarmth; and through the whole she had the art to throw a sort of magic\r\nglow from her own mind which brightened all she spoke of.\r\n\r\nShe was very charming that day, indeed, and Mr. Marlow felt the spell,\r\nbut he did not fall in love.\r\n\r\nNow what was the object of using all these powers upon him? Was Mrs.\r\nHazleton a person very susceptible, or very covetous of the tender\r\npassion? Since her return to England she had refused some half-dozen\r\nvery eligible offers from handsome, agreeable, estimable men, and the\r\nworld in general had set her down for a person as cold as a stone. It\r\nmight be so, but there are some stones which, when you heat them,\r\nacquire intense fervor, and retain it longer than any other substance.\r\nEvery body in the world has his peculiarities, his whims, caprices,\r\ncrochets if you will. Mrs. Hazleton had gazed over the handsome, the\r\nglittering and the gay, with the most perfect indifference. She had\r\nlistened to professions of love with a tranquil, easy balance power,\r\nwhich weighed to a grain the advantages of matrimony and widowhood,\r\nwithout suffering the dust of passion to give even a shake to the scale.\r\nBefore the preceding night she had only seen Mr. Marlow once, but the\r\nmoment she set eyes upon him--the moment she heard his voice, she had\r\nsaid to herself, \"If ever I marry again, that is the man.\" There is no\r\nexplaining these sympathetic attractions, impulses, or whatever they may\r\nbe called; but I think, from some observation of human nature, it will\r\nbe found that in those persons where they are the least frequent, they\r\nare the most powerful and persevering when they do exist.\r\n\r\nNot long after their first meeting, some intimation occurred of a claim\r\non the part of Mr. Marlow to a portion of the lady's property--that\r\nportion that she loved best. The very idea of parting with it at all, of\r\nbeing forced to give it up, was most painful and distressing to her. Yet\r\nthat made no difference whatever in her feelings towards Mr. Marlow.\r\nCommunications of various kinds took place between lawyers, and the\r\nopposite counsel were as firm as a rock. Mrs. Hazleton thought it very\r\nhard, very unjust, very wrong; but that changed not in the least her\r\nfeelings towards Mr. Marlow. Nay more, with that delicate art of\r\ncombination in which ladies are formed to excel, she conceived and\r\nmanipulated with great dexterity a scheme for bringing herself and Mr.\r\nMarlow into frequent personal communication, and for causing somebody to\r\nsuggest to him a marriage with her own beautiful self, as the best mode\r\nof settling the disputed claim.\r\n\r\nO those fine and delicate threads of intrigue, how frail they are, and\r\nhow much depends upon every one of them, be it in the warp or the woof\r\nof a scheme! We have seen that in this case, one of them gave way under\r\nthe rough handling of Sir Philip Hastings, and the whole fabric was in\r\nimminent danger of running down and becoming nothing but a raveled\r\nskein. Mrs. Hazleton was resolved that it should not be so, and now she\r\nwas busily engaged in the attempt to knot together the broken thread,\r\nand to lay all the others straight and in right order again. This was\r\nthe secret of the whole matter.\r\n\r\nShe exerted all her charms, and could Waller but have seen her we should\r\nhave had such an account of the artillery of her eyes, the insidious\r\nattack of her smile, and the whole host of powerful adversaries brought\r\nto bear against the object of her assault in her gracefully moving form\r\nand heaving bosom, that Saccharissa would have melted away like a wet\r\nlump of sugar in the comparison.\r\n\r\nThen again when she had produced an effect, and saw clear and distinctly\r\nthat he thought her lovely, and very charming too, she seemed to fall\r\ninto a pleasant sort of languid melancholy, which was even more charming\r\nstill. The brook was bubbling and murmuring at their feet, dashing clear\r\nand bright over its stony bed, and changing the brown rock, the water\r\nweed, or the leaf beneath, into gems by the magic of its own brightness.\r\nThe boughs were waving over head, covered with many-colored foliage, and\r\nthe sun, glancing through, not only enriched the tints above, but\r\ncheckered the mossy path along which they wandered like a chess-board of\r\nbrown and gold. Some of the late autumn birds uttered their short sweet\r\nsongs from the copse hard by, and the musical wind came sighing up from\r\nthe valley, as if nature had furnished Eolus with a harp. It was in\r\nshort quite a scene, and a moment for a widow to make love to a young\r\nman. They were silent for some little time, and then Mrs. Hazleton said,\r\nwith her soft, sweet, round voice, \"Is not all this very charming, Mr.\r\nMarlow?\"\r\n\r\nHer tone was quite a sad one, but not with that sort of pleasant sadness\r\nwhich often mingles with our happiest moments, giving them even a higher\r\nzest, like the flattened notes when a fine piece of music passes gently\r\nfrom the major into the minor key, but really sad, profoundly sad.\r\n\r\n\"Very charming, indeed,\" replied her young companion, looking round to\r\nher face with some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"And what am I to do without it, when you turn me out of my house?\" said\r\nthe lady, answering his glance with a melancholy smile.\r\n\r\n\"Turn you out of your house!\" exclaimed Mr. Marlow; \"I hope you do not\r\nsuppose, my dear madam, that I could dream of such a thing. Oh, no! I\r\nwould not for the world deprive such a scene of its brightest ornament.\r\nSome arrangement can be easily effected, even if my claim should prove\r\nsatisfactory to those you appoint to investigate it, by which the\r\nneighborhood will not be deprived of the happiness of your presence.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton felt that she had made a great step, and as she well knew\r\nthat there was no chance of his proposing then and there, she resolved\r\nnot to risk losing ground by any farther advance, even while she secured\r\nsome present benefits from that which was gained. \"Well, well,\" she\r\nsaid, \"Mr. Marlow, I am quite sure you are very kind and very generous,\r\nand we can talk of that matter hereafter. Only there is one thing you\r\nmust promise me, which is, that in regard to any arrangements respecting\r\nthe house you will not leave them to be settled by cold lawyers or\r\ncolder friends, who cannot enter into my feelings in regard to this\r\nplace, or your own liberal and kindly feelings either. Let us settle it\r\nsome day between ourselves,\" she added, with a light laugh, \"in a\r\ntete-a-tete like this. I do not suppose you are afraid of being\r\noverreached by me in a bargain. But now let us turn our steps back\r\ntowards the house, for I expect Mrs. Warmington early, and I must not be\r\nabsent when she arrives.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Warmington was there already; for the tete-a-tete had lasted longer\r\nthan Mrs. Hazleton knew. However, Mrs. Hazleton's first task was to\r\ninform her fair friend and counsellor of the cause of Mr. Marlow's being\r\nthere; her next to tell her that all had been settled as to the claim,\r\nby that tiresome man Sir Philip Hastings, without what she considered\r\ndue deliberation, and that the only thing which remained to be arranged\r\nwas in regard to the house, respecting which Mrs. Hazleton communicated\r\na certain portion of her own inclinations, and of Mr. Marlow's kind view\r\nof the matter.\r\n\r\nNow, strange to say, this was the turning point of fate for Mrs.\r\nHazleton, Mr. Marlow, and most of the persons mentioned in this history.\r\nIt was then that Mrs. Warmington suggested a scheme which she thought\r\nwould suit her friend well.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not offer him in exchange--for the time at all events--your\r\nfine old house on the side of Hartwell--Hartwell Place? It is only seven\r\nmiles off. It is ready furnished to his hand, and must be worth a great\r\ndeal more than the bare walls of this. Besides it would be pleasant to\r\nhave him in the neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nPause, Mrs. Hazleton! pause and meditate over all the consequences; for\r\nbe assured much depends upon these few simple words.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton did pause--Mrs. Hazleton did meditate. She ran over in her\r\nhead the list of all the families in the neighborhood. In none of them\r\ncould she see a probable rival. There were plenty of married women, old\r\nmaids, young girls; but she saw nobody to fear, and with a proud\r\nconsciousness of her own beauty and worth, she took her resolution.

He has published two\r\ncollections of short poems, one entitled \"Voices from the Crowd,\" and\r\nthe other and last, \"Egeria, or the Spirit of Nature,\" &c. from which we\r\ntake the following specimens:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WHY THIS LONGING?\r\n\r\n    Why this longing, clay-clad spirit?\r\n      Why this fluttering of thy wings?\r\n    Why this striving to discover\r\n      Hidden and transcendent things?\r\n    Be contented in thy prison,\r\n      Thy captivity shall cease--\r\n    Taste the good that smiles before thee;\r\n      Restless spirit, be at peace!\r\n\r\n    With the roar of wintry forests,\r\n      With the thunder's crash and roll,\r\n    With the rush of stormy water,\r\n      Thou wouldst sympathize, O soul!\r\n    Thou wouldst ask them mighty questions\r\n      In a language of their own,\r\n    Untranslatable to mortals,\r\n      Yet not utterly unknown.\r\n\r\n    Thou wouldst fathom Life and Being,\r\n      Thou wouldst see through Birth and Death,\r\n    Thou wouldst solve the eternal riddle--\r\n      Thou a speck, a ray, a breath,\r\n    Thou wouldst look at stars and systems,\r\n      As if _thou_ couldst understand\r\n    All the harmonies of Nature,\r\n      Struck by an Almighty hand.\r\n\r\n    With thy feeble logic, tracing\r\n      Upward from effect to cause,\r\n    Thou art foiled by Nature's barriers,\r\n      And the limits of her laws.\r\n    Be at peace, thou struggling spirit!\r\n      Great Eternity denies\r\n    The unfolding of its secrets\r\n      In the circle of thine eyes.\r\n\r\n    Be contented with thy freedom--\r\n      Dawning is not perfect day;\r\n    There are truths thou canst not fathom,\r\n      Swaddled in thy robes of clay.\r\n    Rest in hope that if thy circle\r\n      Grow not wider here in Time,\r\n    God's Eternity shall give thee\r\n      Power of vision more sublime.\r\n\r\n    Clogged and bedded in the darkness,\r\n      Little germ abide thine hour,\r\n    Thoul't expand in proper season,\r\n      Into blossom, into flower.\r\n    Humble faith alone becomes thee\r\n      In the glooms where thou art lain:\r\n    Bright is the appointed future;\r\n      Wait--thou shalt not wait in vain.\r\n\r\n    Cease thy struggling, feeble spirit!\r\n      Fret not at thy prison bars;\r\n    Never shall thy mortal pinions\r\n      Make the circuit of the stars.\r\n    Here on Earth are duties for thee,\r\n      Suited to thine earthly scope;\r\n    Seek them, thou Immortal Spirit--\r\n      God is with thee--work in hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n    YOU AND I.\r\n\r\n    Who would scorn his humble fellow\r\n      For the coat he wears?\r\n    For the poverty he suffers?\r\n      For his daily cares?\r\n    Who would pass him in the footway\r\n      With averted eye?\r\n    Would you, brother?

GEORGES.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 229._\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond crime: A cold and deliberate attempt upon the life of Stenio\r\nSalvatori, on the public square of _Torre-del-Greco_. The Count listened\r\nto this harangue without emotion. \"Bring in,\" said the judge, \"both the\r\nwitnesses and the plaintiffs, for they have a double quality.\"\r\n\r\nAt this summons, a man of stern and moody aspect appeared, with his hair\r\nand dress in great disorder. He was sustained by two others, and the\r\ngroup paused at the foot of the balcony, where the judges sat.\r\n\r\n\"Your name?\" said the Grand Judge, to the eldest of the three.\r\n\r\n\"Stenio Salvatori,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"Your names?\" asked the Grand Judge, of the other two.\r\n\r\n\"Raphael Salvatori--\"\r\n\r\n\"Francesco Salvatori.\"\r\n\r\n\"You swear before God to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear,\" said each of them.\r\n\r\n\"Do you persist in your accusation against Count Monte-Leone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said they.\r\n\r\n\"The Count,\" continued Francesco, \"presided over the _Venta_ at Pompeia,\r\nwhere he was seen by my brothers and myself. In our presence he\r\nadministered the oath to two of the neophytes of the society. They\r\npromised to contribute by every means in their power to the dethronement\r\nof our well-beloved sovereign Fernando IV., and to destroy monarchy\r\nforever in our country. The associates of the Count,\" added Raphael and\r\nFrancesco, \"discovered us listening to them, and our energy and strength\r\nalone preserved us from their poniards.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my energy and strength,\" said Stenio, with an accent of rage, as he\r\nsprang unexpectedly from the bench on which he sat and pointed to\r\nMonte-Leone, \"were able to contend with difficulty against the iron hand\r\nand poniard of this man.\" Then tearing up the cuff which hid his wound,\r\nhe showed the judges a deep and blood-stained stab. A feeling of horror\r\ntook possession of all the assembly. Every eye was fixed on Monte-Leone,\r\nwho seemed unconscious of the sentiment he inspired.\r\n\r\n\"The Count avenged himself on one of us, because we did our duty in\r\ndenouncing him,\" said Francesco Salvatori.\r\n\r\n\"He would have murdered us all had he been able,\" said Raphael.\r\n\r\n\"Stenio,\" resumed Francesco, \"has atoned for all the family.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we ask,\" said Stenio, with a terrible voice, \"we ask justice on the\r\nassassin! We demand it of God, the king, and the judges.\"\r\n\r\nThe tall stature of Stenio, his pallor heightened by anger, and the\r\nbloody arm he intentionally exposed, made such an impression on the\r\nspectators that a murmur of approbation ran round the room. More\r\nnumerous voices, however, soon drowned it.\r\n\r\n\"Count Monte-Leone, have you prepared yourself to reply to these\r\naccusations, or have you chosen a defender?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Name him,\" said the Grand Judge.\r\n\r\n\"My defender is Stenio Salvatori, my accuser.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the surprise caused by these words, not only in the\r\nminds of the three witnesses, but of the court and public.\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said the Grand Judge, solemnly, \"you must remember this\r\naccusation is a solemn one; that you are accused of two crimes, the\r\npunishment of which is known to you. Such an answer testifies your small\r\nrespect to this court, and must injure a cause which needs to be ably\r\ndefended.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" replied Monte-Leone, \"it is because I recognize the great\r\nimportance of the cause, that I confide to this man the duty of\r\nexonerating me from it. He alone can do so: his mouth alone, his lips,\r\nwill demonstrate my innocence. Stenio Salvatori says, he saw me preside\r\nat the Venta of Pompeia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said Stenio, rising again.\r\n\r\n\"He says I stabbed him at his threshold in the town of\r\n_Torre-del-Greco_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Stenio.\r\n\r\n\"You see clearly, Signori,\" continued the Count, speaking to the court,\r\n\"that this man is establishing my case distinctly, as he saw me neither\r\nat Pompeia nor at _Torre-del-Greco_. The day on which he, his brothers,\r\nand the people of the latter town, say they saw me, I was imprisoned in\r\na cell of the Castle _Del Uovo_, an impenetrable prison whence it is\r\nimpossible for any human creature to escape, and whence none saw me go.\"\r\n\r\nBravos filled the hall. The Count was triumphing.\r\n\r\n\"Signori,\" said the Grand Judge, rising, \"such applause is an insult to\r\nthe court, and if it be renewed, the trial will be continued with closed\r\ndoors.\" Silence was restored.\r\n\r\n\"Do not believe him,\" said Stenio, turning towards the auditors and\r\nshowing his bloody arm. \"He was the person who wounded me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justice shall be done,\" said the Grand Judge. \"Signori, a series of\r\nsecret and minute inquiries instituted in the Castle _Del Uovo_, the\r\nexamination of the employers of the fortress and the confronting of the\r\ngate-keeper, a man of known piety, and the head jailer, one of the most\r\nsevere and incorruptible of Naples, have been unable to show how the\r\nCount Monte-Leone contrived to escape from prison. In the face of such\r\ncomplete evidence of his having remained in the prison, in the face of\r\nthe report of the minister of police who visited the prison a few hours\r\nafter the commission of the crime at _Torre-del-Greco_, we could not\r\nbut recognize the innocence of the Count, and fancy that something had\r\nled to a mistake in his person. A strange and providential circumstance\r\nmakes us doubt the innocence of the Count, and though the means of his\r\nescape from the castle be unknown to us, we persist in thinking him\r\nguilty as accused.\"\r\n\r\nThe interest and emotion of the audience was as great as it could be;\r\nand the words of the Grand Judge were listened to with the most intense\r\nanxiety. At that moment three hearts almost ceased to beat--that of the\r\nveiled woman, that of the young man who had replied to her signal, and\r\nthat of Count Monte-Leone, though his features were unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"The Count,\" resumed the Grand Judge, \"possesses a family jewel, a ring\r\nof immense price, one of the _chef-d'oeuvres_ of Benvenuto Cellini.\r\nThis ring he rarely lays aside, as we learn from many witnesses, and a\r\nsecret superstition induces him always to wear it. Did he hide it from\r\nthe jailers at the time of his incarceration, or did he obtain\r\npossession of it on his way to _Torre-del-Greco_? This has not as yet\r\nbeen demonstrated: one thing, however, is certain, he lost this jewel in\r\nhis contest with Stenio Salvatori, who, having obtained possession of\r\nit, placed it in the hands of his Excellency the Duke of Palma, as a\r\npositive and incontestable evidence of the criminality of the Count.\r\nThis mute witness is here,\" said the Grand Judge, who as he spoke\r\nexhibited a sparkling brilliant to the audience.\r\n\r\nThe judges took the emerald, and silently looked at it. When the Grand\r\nJudge first spoke of the emerald, the Count was satisfied that he was\r\nlost, and drops of icy sweat coursed down his cheeks. But yet his\r\ncourage and energy, even when he saw the emerald in the hands of the\r\njudges, did not desert him, and he struggled against the new danger\r\nwhich had beset him in so strange and unexpected a manner.\r\n\r\n\"This ring,\" said he, pointing to the emerald, \"is a fortune in itself,\r\nand may have been stolen from me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grand Judge arose to reply, when an old man advanced toward the\r\ntribunal, pushing aside all who opposed his passage, and in spite of the\r\nresistance of the ushers and guards, reached the foot of the balcony on\r\nwhich the judges sat. With tears and an excited voice he said:\r\n\r\n\"The ring has not been stolen! It has not left our jewel closet, and I\r\nhave brought it to the judges.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not believe him,\" said the Salvatori, \"he deceives you. This is the\r\nCount's ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, impostors!\" said the old man. \"I learned yesterday, from\r\npublic rumor, the story of our ring being lost by Count Monte-Leone, the\r\nintendant of whom I am, and I have brought the precious jewel hither to\r\nconfound our accusers.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could equal the effect produced by Giacomo's words. The court\r\nitself participated in the surprise, and the Grand Judge, making the old\r\nservant approach, took the jewel from his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Two rings!\" said he, amazed; \"two similar emeralds! Signori,\" said he,\r\nspeaking to the court, \"this event again changes the face of this trial.\r\nOne of these jewels is evidently a copy of the other, such as the hand\r\nof a great artist alone can produce. There was, however, never but one\r\nBenvenuto in the world, and it will be easy to distinguish his work.\"\r\n\r\nThe words of the Grand Judge increased the agitation of the crowd. The\r\nCount, whom his friends thought saved, lost by the discovery of the\r\nemerald, and again restored by the testimony of Giacomo, became every\r\nmoment an object of new interest and more intense curiosity. If we must\r\nuse the word, pity for him increased. Every step taken seemed to bring\r\nhis head nearer to or to remove it farther from the executioner. Just\r\nhere this event interrupted the session of the court.\r\n\r\nThe judges retired to their room, the Salvatori to the witness chamber,\r\nuntil the experts, whom the president had sent for, should come. The\r\ninterval between the acts, however, was filled by a touching episode\r\nwhich deeply excited the audience. Giacomo, taking advantage of the\r\ndeparture of the judges, hurried to his master, fell at his knees, and\r\ncovered his hand with kisses.\r\n\r\n\"Go back!--go back!\" said the chief of the officers to Giacomo. \"No one\r\nis permitted to communicate with the accused.\"\r\n\r\nAdding action to words, they seized the old man by the arm, and bore him\r\nfrom his master.\r\n\r\nGiacomo however found time to whisper to the Count, \"You are saved.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd was so touched by the affection of the old servant, that it\r\nwas near taking sides with him against the officers who had interfered.\r\n\r\nThe veiled lady stood motionless as a statue and watched the scene. So\r\nabstracted and calm did she appear, that it might have been supposed her\r\neyes looked on while her mind was far away. Her eyes, animated by a\r\nthousand sentiments, glittered beneath her veil. The young man to whom\r\nshe had made signals did not lose sight of her, and his whole soul\r\nseemed enchained to the life presence and breath of this woman.\r\n\r\nThe experts came; the court resumed its sessions; the Salvatori entered.\r\nThe experts were three of the most skilful lapidaries of Naples, where\r\nthe art of engraving on stone had reached the greatest excellence. They\r\napproached the bar. The president said:\r\n\r\n\"On your soul and conscience, and by Christ your Saviour, you swear to\r\ntell the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"We swear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us which of these two rings is the work of Benvenuto Cellini.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my soul and conscience, and by Christ,\" said the first expert, after\r\na careful scrutiny, \"this is the work of Benvenuto Cellini.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, sir?\" said the judge to the second.\r\n\r\n\"On my soul and conscience, and by Christ, this is the work of the great\r\nmaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this ring,\" said the judge, \"what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is but a copy, compared with the original, of trifling value and\r\nfineness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Signori,\" said the Grand Judge, rising, and with a ring in\r\neach hand. \"This ring given me yesterday by the Duke of Palma, and by\r\nhim received from the Salvatori, is an imitation of Benvenuto Cellini's\r\ngreat work. The real ring of the Monte-Leoni, the chef-d'oeuvre, an\r\nheir-loom of the family, has just been brought us by an old servant of\r\nthat noble house.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the words of the Grand Judge was immense. He was silent,\r\nand with the other judges consulted about the decree. A few moments\r\nafter, with his hand on his heart, the Grand Judge said:\r\n\r\n\"After having carefully sought for traces of the double crime of which\r\nCount Monte-Leone is accused--after having heard the public accuser, the\r\nproof is found most incomplete. It appears that all the facts are based\r\non the resemblance of Count Monte-Leone with some unknown person, in\r\nrelation to whose identity the Salvatori were mistaken. The court\r\ndeclares the Count Monte-Leone innocent of the double crime imputed to\r\nhim, and orders that he be immediately released. As for you, the\r\nbrothers Salvatori,\" continued the Grand Judge, sternly, \"your hatred to\r\nthe Count Monte-Leone is well known. We interpret your conduct in the\r\nmost favorable light, attributing it to mistake, and not to cowardly\r\nrevenge. If the counterfeit ring was fabricated at your instance, to\r\ncorroborate the accusations made against the Count, and justice should\r\nbecome possessed of proofs of it, you would have to fear its rigor and\r\npunishment. If there be severe laws for calumniators, those for\r\nassassins are yet more stern. You would in that case have murdered Count\r\nMonte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\nThe Salvatori were amazed. The rage of Stenio was irrepressible.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful justice! Do we serve the king so faithfully for his justices\r\nto treat us thus! I repeat again,\" said he with an accent so terrible\r\nthat it reached even Monte-Leone's heart, \"the Count was at Pompeia. He\r\nstabbed me. He is an assassin!\"\r\n\r\nHe then left as he had entered, walking painfully, and leaning on the\r\narms of his brothers. When Stenio Salvatori, spoke thus, the Count had\r\nwithdrawn, and the noise in the hall prevented the judges from hearing\r\nhim. The tumult was as great as possible in the hall, which hitherto had\r\nbeen so calm and silent. The public seemed to move, shout, and become\r\nclamorous, as a recompense for the constraint which had been so long\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful woman in the recess, who had been so long impassible and\r\nmotionless, seemed to sympathize with the excited crowd, and lifting up\r\nher noble form to its full height, as the Grand Judge spoke the last\r\nwords, she threw aside her veil, and lifted to heaven her eyes, full of\r\ngratitude and joy. She then looked toward Monte-Leone with an expression\r\nof the most passionate love, and immediately letting fall her veil, as\r\nif to enwrap her sentiments in night, left the room. Quickly, however,\r\nas she left, the first of the young men, whose conversation was detailed\r\nin the early part of this chapter, had time to see her, and said to his\r\ncompanion:\r\n\r\n\"Signor, indeed you are fortunate. The lady of whom we spoke not long\r\nsince, and whom you know so well, is the very spirit of beauty\r\nincarnate, she is the most magnificent woman in the world. It is _La\r\nFelina_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\" said Taddeo Rovero, who had become yet paler when the\r\nsinger threw up her veil.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so,\" said the first speaker, with a smile, \"and I am also\r\nsure you know so.\" He left.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the friends and partisans of the Count surrounded him.\r\nAmong them were the chief nobles of Naples, for, as has been said\r\nbefore, the cause of one of the order became that of all, and\r\nMonte-Leone's success was a triumph to all the class. Amid a proud and\r\ngallant escort, the Count left the _Castello Capuano_. Scarcely had he\r\nleft the door when enthusiastic cries were heard on all sides. The\r\npeople, who had been in the street since dawn, waited impatiently for\r\nthe result of the trial, for Monte-Leone was immensely popular. The\r\ncrowd from time to time heard the various incidents of the trial from\r\npersons who had contrived to get into the hall. The rumors in favor of\r\nMonte-Leone were received with shouts of joy, and those injurious to him\r\nwith cries and curses. The sentence was hailed as a priceless boon by\r\nthe crowd around the _Chateau Capuano_. The people are everywhere, it is\r\nsaid, the same. The people of every country are doubtless impressionable\r\nand easily excited. A kind of electricity pervades large bodies, and the\r\nsubtle fluid certainly is found everywhere. But among people of the\r\nsouth, under the burning sun which scorches their brains, the Italians,\r\nand especially the Neapolitans, in their public assemblies, attain a\r\ndegree of fanaticism and exaltation, of which the people of the north\r\nhave no idea. The eruptions of their own Vesuvius are the only things to\r\nwhich the passions of their populace can be compared.\r\n\r\nWhen the Count and his escort left the court-room, the people literally\r\nrushed upon them. A thousand hands, not half so seemly as those which\r\nalready had clasped his own, were extended towards his. These strong and\r\nsturdy hands seemed to promise him protection in case it should be\r\nneedful for him at any future time to seek it.\r\n\r\nFrom this crowd of men with sternly marked features, shaded by hats of\r\ngray felt, there fell on the Count's ear such words as, \"_Two hands\r\npledged in friendship are but one!_\" Venta of Castel la Marc.\r\n\r\n\"_A dagger for ten enemies!_\" Venta of Capua.\r\n\r\n\"_Our right, silence, or death!_\" Venta of Annunziata.\r\n\r\n\"_Eyes to watch, and a hand to strike!_\" Venta of Pompeia.\r\n\r\nTo which the Count replied, by the word _Speranza_, accompanied by a\r\nclasp of the hand and a significative glance.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said a penetrating voice, \"for heaven's sake give him air.\r\nThe poor man has need of air. We know you love him. He is the friend of\r\nthe people of Naples, all know, but he should not on that account be\r\nstifled. By the miracle of San Januarius restore him to me, restore my\r\nmaster to me, you may have him soon, but now he needs the care of old\r\nGiacomo.\"\r\n\r\nGiacomo took the Count's arm, and sought to remove him from the crowd\r\nwhich surrounded him. The Count paid no attention to the old intendant.\r\nFor a time, he strove almost to cast him off, and stood looking\r\nanxiously at a person he saw in the crowd, and whom like a swimmer he\r\nsought to approach. This person was his friend Taddeo Rovero. The young\r\nman sought in vain to approach the Count. The tide of living beings\r\nseconded their wishes, and at last they rushed into the arms of each\r\nother, forgetting, while thus enlocked, the world, their secret\r\nthoughts, the past, and the present, and mingling together the tears of\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\"Air, day, sunlight, motion, life, life itself I have found. They woke\r\nup our existence; a dungeon is death--\"\r\n\r\nAgain he threw himself into the arms of Taddeo, with an expression of\r\ntenderness and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, my friends,\" said he to the crowd. \"Count Monte-Leone will never\r\nforget these proofs of your sympathy, and you may rely on him, his arm,\r\nhis heart, his fortune, as he does on you.\"\r\n\r\nTaking Taddeo by the arm, he hurried into a neighboring street,\r\naccompanied at a little distance by Giacomo, who, as he panted after\r\nthem, cried out, \"Too fast, too fast--what the devil can I do? My legs\r\nare worn out--remember I came from the villa to _la Vicaria_ on foot to\r\nbring your ring to the Grand Judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"My ring!\"--then looking anxiously at Giacomo, and in a low tone, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure it is my ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I swear to it by the blood of Christ and by your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said the Count, \"we have strange secrets to talk of when\r\nwe are in a safe place. And there the ear and lip must be close\r\ntogether, so that not even the walls of the room in which we are shall\r\nbe struck by the sound of our accents. Wait for me at the Etruscan\r\nvilla. In two hours I will rejoin you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not go thither now?\" asked Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"Two hours hence I will tell you.\"\r\n\r\nWithout speaking a word, and without listening to Rovero's reply,\r\nMonte-Leone put on a cloak the old intendant had brought and passed into\r\na labyrinth of passages, with the intricate windings of which his\r\npolitical associations had made him familiar. An hour after the Count so\r\nbrusquely left Taddeo and the old intendant, he paused at the door of\r\none of the most ancient churches in Naples, an old pile, built in 1284,\r\nand called _San Domenico Maggiore_. It is of vast size, built in the\r\nGothic style, and has a magnificent picture of Titiano, the Flagellation\r\nof Caravaggio, and in the sacristy a glory by Solimene. But not to\r\ncontemplate them had Monte-Leone come to the church. A deeply-rooted\r\nsentiment forced him, for a few moments, to pause beneath the old\r\nportico before he entered the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nNothing is more touching, more poetical, and more mysterious, than the\r\nold Christian temples, which like giants of stone have braved the\r\nravages of time and the hands of men. Generations, as they pass away,\r\nworship beneath their arches, and the prayers of many centuries have\r\nechoed in their walls, which are yet open to coming time.\r\n\r\nThe deep notes of the organ attracted the attention of Monte-Leone and\r\nincreased his excitement. He crossed the church, went down the nave, and\r\napproached a lateral chapel where a taper was burning with a flickering\r\nlight. The Count entered the chapel. Those who had seen him amid the\r\nbrilliant society of Naples, or amid the awful judicial ordeal to which\r\nhe had just been subjected, and which he had undergone with such\r\ncoolness and audacity, would not have recognized the humble and\r\ntrembling man, who knelt before a sarcophagus of black marble surmounted\r\nwith the coronet and arms of the Monte-Leoni. The Count knelt at the\r\ntomb of his father--his father, who was his religion and his faith. He\r\nwould have thought himself unworthy of his protection had he not gone\r\nimmediately on his release to worship those consecrated relics.\r\nProstrate at the monument he prayed with fervor. All the recent events\r\nof his life occurred to him. And in the kind of hallucination caused by\r\nprolonged meditation, awake as he was, he entered the realm of dreams.\r\nHe seemed to see two genii seeking, the one to drag him towards heaven\r\nand the other towards the abyss. The genii were two females. They\r\nrecalled the features of two charming and beautiful women, whom he\r\nremembered. One had the gentle and pale expression of Aminta; the other,\r\nthe more masculine and stately air of La Felina. The one which led him\r\nheavenward was Aminta. The sound of the organ, the mysterious light\r\nwhich pervaded the chapel, the religious effect of the whole scene,\r\nexaggerated the excitement of the Count, and contributed to add to his\r\nnervousness. Two mild melancholy voices, like those of angels praying\r\nfor the guilty, mingled with the organ's notes, and Monte-Leone fancied\r\nthat he heard in the distance the voices of departed souls. The blood\r\nof Monte-Leone became chilled, for at that moment he asked his father to\r\nreveal to him the future, and guide him in his perilous path. The song\r\nof the dead seemed to reply to him. The Count, like other energetic and\r\nbrave men, like Caesar and Napoleon, was very superstitious. We have seen\r\nhim brave death without trembling, though it came in the most terrible\r\nform. He who had struggled against the waves of the sea, and confronted\r\nthe Grand Judge of Naples, grew pale when he heard the _de profundis_\r\nchanted in an obscure church and by the side of a tomb. By a strange\r\nfatality, nothing seemed wanting which could increase the sadness of\r\nMonte-Leone. Just as he was about to leave the church the solitary light\r\nwas extinguished. The young man fancied this accident a declaration of\r\nthe will of God. Terror-stricken, he left the church, and did not regain\r\nhis consciousness until he stood in the portico of the old temple. In a\r\nfew moments he shook off his idle apprehensions, but the sombre scene\r\nperpetually reacted upon him, as we shall see hereafter. It left a deep\r\ntrace upon his mind, and materially influenced his subsequent life.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after he left the church, the Count rode on the horse of one\r\nof his friends to the Etruscan villa, which, as we have said, was on the\r\nroad to Castel la Marc. Giacomo was waiting at the door for him, and\r\ntaking a resinous torch, lighted his master to the strange room which we\r\ndescribed in the first part of this book. Things remained precisely as\r\nthey were on the night of the ball of San Carlo. The lights were\r\nburning, the hangings displayed their richness, the Greek and Roman\r\ncouches were arrayed, and a magnificent supper was prepared. There were,\r\nhowever, but two covers, one for the Count and the other for young\r\nRovero. By the side of the Count's plate lay the emerald of Benvenuto,\r\nof which he had so miraculously regained possession.\r\n\r\n\"It is the emerald,\" said the Count. \"Who brought it hither?\"\r\n\r\n\"An officer of the court, from Signor San Angelo, the Grand Judge of\r\nNaples.\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone looked at it again, and said, \"It is one of God's own\r\nmiracles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" said Rovero, \"it is one of Love's own;\" and he gave the Count\r\nthe letter of La Felina.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--DRAMA.\r\n\r\nWhile the trial of Count Monte-Leone thus excited the whole city of\r\nNaples, while Rovero under the influence of a thousand emotions heard\r\nall its details, let us look back to what is going on in the villa at\r\nSorrento. The reader will excuse us, for thus transporting him from\r\nplace to place, for attempting to interest him in behalf of various\r\npersonages, joining or deserting them, as the plan of our story\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nThe novelist is like the weaver, who keeps in his hand the various\r\nthreads of his woof, brings them together and apart, until the time when\r\nhis finished work rewards his toil. Like the weaver, we shall unite, day\r\nby day, our threads, and gather them finally into one knot.\r\n\r\nWe left the Marquis of Maulear about to return to the villa, in search\r\nof assistance for Scorpione, who had fainted. When people came to the\r\nhut, the mute had regained his senses. He knelt before Aminta, who spoke\r\nto him with vivacity. What she said we cannot tell, for when she was\r\ninterrupted she ceased. The eyes of Tonio were red, and he seemed to\r\nhave been shedding tears. The invalid was taken to the villa, and so the\r\nmatter seemed to end.\r\n\r\nMaulear was not much engrossed by the suspicions he had previously\r\nconceived of Tonio, because love for Aminta, supposing that such he\r\nbore, did not seem formidable. His apprehensions found something far\r\nmore serious. Was the heart of her he loved unoccupied? The strange\r\nepisode of the lost veil had not yet been explained. Yielding to the\r\ninfluence of passion, he had, when he saw the young girl, forgotten\r\nevery thing, and the sudden appearance of Scorpione, by rendering it\r\nimpossible for Aminta to answer him, complicated the matter yet more.\r\n\r\nJust as Signora Rovero went towards the hut, where the Marquis had left\r\nthe mute in a state of insensibility, Aminta went to the villa,\r\npreceding those who bore Tonio.\r\n\r\n\"I will not again trust you with our patient,\" said Aminta's mother. \"He\r\nalways returns worse than when he goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right mother,\" said Aminta, \"henceforth I will not take charge of\r\nTonio, for his new sufferings have, I am sure, taken away the little\r\nsense he previously had.\"\r\n\r\nTonio, who heard what Aminta said, looked down and returned to his room,\r\nglooming angrily at the Marquis as he passed.\r\n\r\n\"You are already one of us, Marquis, on account of the indiscreet\r\nrequest of my son. But neither my daughter nor myself will complain of\r\nthe pleasure he has thus procured us. Now,\" continued she, \"permit me to\r\nshow you the most precious treasure in our house.\"\r\n\r\nLeading Maulear to a little boudoir, next her chamber, she drew aside a\r\ncurtain of black velvet, and exposed a noble portrait of a man the size\r\nof life. \"That is the portrait of my husband, of Aminta's father; of a\r\nloyal and respected man, of an honest and influential minister.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear was amazed at the appearance of the picture. The more he\r\nexamined it the more the features seemed to recall some one he had seen\r\nbefore. His memory, however, was at fault, and left him in uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" said he, to the widow of the minister. \"It seems that I have\r\nseen these features before. How can it be, though, that I ever met\r\nSignor Rovero?\"\r\n\r\n\"My husband has been dead two years, and was never in France.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have been but six months in Italy. It is then impossible that we\r\never met. The matter is surprising.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to the drawing-room, where Maulear found the White Rose of\r\nSorrento either drawing or pretending to draw, as a means of concealing\r\nher annoyance.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said Signora Rovero to Maulear, \"if I leave you for a time\r\nwith my daughter. I have some domestic matters to attend to, for\r\nAminta's birthday will in a few days be here, when we purpose a ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"A ball?\" said Maulear.\r\n\r\n\"A ball; and Aminta and some of her young companions will compose the\r\norchestra. You, Marquis, will not, however, be forced to be present, for\r\nmy son had no intention to annoy you thus. It is enough for you to\r\nprotect us, but to dance would be too great a requisition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it, then, the Signorina's birthday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, or rather it is the birthday of my happiness. Thus it ever is with\r\nmothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will then be mine also,\" said Maulear. \"I am sorry her brother\r\ncannot be present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo is fond of us,\" said the young girl in a low tone, with her eyes\r\ndowncast on her embroidery. \"But he does not love us alone.\" Aminta\r\nsighed with jealousy--and Signora Rovero left the room. Maulear drew\r\nnear Aminta.\r\n\r\n\"Signorina,\" said he, with emotion, \"just now I opened my heart to you.\r\nWill you punish me by silence, and not deign to tell me what I may fear\r\nor hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said Aminta, \"perhaps I am wrong to reply to you. Perhaps I\r\nshould ask you, in the first place, to speak to my mother of the\r\nsentiments you entertain for me. But I will be frank with you. Our first\r\ninterview, my gratitude, my sincere esteem, control me. Besides, as you\r\nhave been informed, my education has not been that usual to my sex. I\r\nwill therefore describe to you my girlish ideas such us they are, such\r\nas my early education inspired me with, such as reflection has\r\ndeveloped.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear looked at her with great wonder. Where he had expected surprise\r\nand embarrassment, he found calmness and reason. Still, the voice in\r\nwhich these serious words were pronounced had, however, so great an\r\nattraction and such melody, that the Marquis began again to hope.\r\n\r\n\"Different from most young persons of my age,\" said Aminta, \"I am happy\r\nin my present condition, contented with my mother and brother. I have\r\noften inquired what qualities I would expect in my husband, and,\" said\r\nshe with a smile, \"I have found them. Perhaps those qualities are\r\ndefects; for they must be my own I assure you. I have been so petted\r\nthat I can conceive of no happiness except in finding myself, with my\r\nimperfections, ideas, and sentiments, mirrored in another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Marquis, \"no one can expect to please you, for who can\r\nbe like you, and be as precious as you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be an easier thing than you fancy,\" said Aminta, gayly.\r\n\"Hitherto I have, however, been unfortunate, for my suitors have been so\r\nsuperior that their merit terrified me. I was afraid of the talents of\r\none, and of the mind of another. Besides, Marquis, let me tell you, that\r\nI am a little foolish and exaggerated. I think there are two existences\r\nin me, the one awake, and the other asleep. In the latter, there pass\r\nsuch fancies before me, that I am often frightened at them. I sometimes\r\nsee the drama of life unrolled before me.--I am married and\r\nunhappy--strange scenes take place around me, and he to whom my fate has\r\nbeen confided, makes it sad and dreary as possible;--I am humiliated,\r\noutraged, and betrayed, and am, too, so much afraid of marriage, that I\r\nthink I would refuse the hand of an angel were it offered me.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Aminta's features became sad, and her eyes glittered with\r\na sombre fire, like that of the Pythoness announcing the Delphic oracle.\r\nMaulear was silent, and for a few moments said nothing. In the mean time\r\nthe young girl regained her presence of mind, and, ashamed of her\r\nenthusiasm, sought to apologize for it.\r\n\r\n\"You will,\" said she, \"laugh at my ridiculous whims. What, however, do\r\nyou expect of a poor child, raised like myself in solitude,\r\nuncultivated, and from character and taste a dreamer? Such a creature\r\nmust indeed be strange to a Parisian. Perhaps, though you do not wish me\r\nthus to speak to you, such a creature has made a deeper impression on\r\nyour imagination than on your heart. The terrible circumstances of our\r\nmeeting also, the romantic origin of our acquaintance, may lead you into\r\nerror in relation to sentiments which perhaps would be impotent, both\r\nagainst the enticements of the world and against absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Maulear, with chagrin, \"if those sentiments were shared--if\r\nhe who experiences them were not indifferent to you, you, Signorina,\r\nwould have confidence in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I desire nothing better than to be satisfied that such is the case,\"\r\nsaid she, with charming naivete. \"Time, however, is required for that,\r\nand we have been acquainted only for a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are years then required for us to love?\" said Maulear. \"For that a\r\nword, a look, suffice.\"\r\n\r\n\"In France, perhaps,\" replied Aminta; \"in your brilliant saloons, with\r\nyour gay countrymen, where all is so lively and spontaneous. Here\r\nthough, in a modest villa, hidden by the orange trees of Sorrento, a\r\nyoung girl's heart is not disposed of so easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" said Maulear, \"our hearts are lost when we behold you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marquis,\" said Aminta, \"I do not know what the future reserves for us;\r\nI however repeat that I will always be sincere with you. Do not to-day\r\nask me what I cannot give.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can you give me?\" said Maulear in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Hope,\" said Aminta, with a blush, \"that is all--\"\r\n\r\nSignora Rovero entered. Rejection and obstacles could not but surprise a\r\nman used as Maulear was to rapid triumphs and easy conquests. He was now\r\nseriously in love, and passion had become a link of his life. Suffering\r\nas he was from the uncertainty to which the reply of Aminta subjected\r\nhim, he could not but admire her prudence and modest reserve, which, as\r\nit were, placed her heart beneath the aegis of reason. Besides, if, as\r\nMadame de Stael says, the last idea of a woman is always centred in the\r\nlast word she utters, Aminta, by what she had last said, had delighted\r\nMaulear. She had said \"_Hope_.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next day and the next day after, Signora Rovero and her\r\ndaughter increased their attention to Maulear, lest he should become\r\nweary of their solitude. This solitude to Maulear was elysium. A\r\npleasant intimacy grew up between Aminta and the Marquis, every hour\r\nrevealing a new grace to him, as he fancied the hour drew near when the\r\nice of her heart would melt, and she would find an image of her\r\nsentiments in him. One circumstance, however, troubled Maulear, and\r\naroused his jealousy. Towards the end of the second day, he sat in the\r\nsaloon, leaning on his elbow, and looking with admiration through one of\r\nthe windows at the purple and magnificent Italian sun. Aminta did not\r\nknow that Maulear was in the saloon, and when she came in did not see\r\nhim. She had a letter in her hand. \"_From him_,\" said she, as she\r\nhastily unsealed it; \"what does he say? _Dear_ Gaetano, he has not\r\nforgotten me.\"\r\n\r\nAt the name Gaetano, Maulear turned around quickly, and under the\r\ninfluence of much emotion, stood before her. She seemed a little\r\nsurprised and disconcerted, and hid the letter in her bosom. The words\r\ndied away on the Marquis's lips, and he asked no question. His original\r\ndistrust returned, and he resolved to watch. On that evening Maulear was\r\nless gay and less entertaining than he had been on the previous one. He\r\nobserved that Aminta too was thoughtful. She has been unable, said he,\r\nto read her letter, and that is the cause of her uneasiness. For a few\r\nmoments the young girl left the room, in which her mother and Maulear\r\nwere. She is reading the mysterious letter, said he to himself. Just\r\nthen it chanced that Signora Rovero spoke of Gaetano Brignoli, to whom\r\nshe paid the greatest compliments. Aminta returned with an expression\r\naltogether changed. Her face was lit up with joy, as expressive and\r\nanimated as the tedium and thoughtfulness which marked it had been\r\nprofound. Maulear did not sympathize with her gayety, and she became\r\nevery moment more moody and sombre. Under the pretext of a headache, he\r\nretired to his room. New thoughts assailed him. He looked out on the\r\nterrace where he had seen the unknown form. He took the lace veil and\r\nexamined it as if he now saw it for the first time. Men are often cruel\r\nto themselves, and find a secret pleasure in turning the knife in the\r\nwound, and making their suffering severe as possible. To tell the truth,\r\nwhen he thought of his conversation with Aminta, and analyzed its\r\nphases, he was led by its elevation and frankness to blush at his\r\nsuspicions. After all, said he, the letter she received from Gaetano is\r\nperhaps only a child's-play between them. It is but a secret between\r\nbrother and sister, such as often exists, and to which it is foolish to\r\nattach any importance. Amid this excitement, sleep overtook him,\r\nharassed as he was between hope and fear, good and evil.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Aminta's birthday. All in Signora Rovero's villa were\r\njoyous. The gates of the garden were opened, and all were gathering\r\nflowers. The young girls of Sorrento soon came to the villa, and offered\r\na magnificent chaplet of roses to _the White Rose_ of Sorrento. The\r\nMarquis of Maulear added his congratulations to the others offered to\r\nAminta. An air of embarrassment, however, was evident in every remark,\r\nand he could not forget the letter. Suddenly he saw Tonio. He was\r\napproaching Aminta, who, when she saw him, hurried to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Tonio, poor Tonio,\" said she, \"my faithful companion and generous\r\npreserver, have you also come to congratulate me on my birthday? You\r\nhave not forgotten me, but are come to say how you love me. You know how\r\ngrateful I am.\"\r\n\r\nTwo tears fell on the mute's brow which was humbled before her. Tonio\r\nlooked up, and his eyes expressed the languishing tenderness of which we\r\nhave hitherto spoken. One might read, in his glance, the effect of that\r\nmagnetic fascination exercised over him by Aminta. He seized her hand,\r\nand kissed it so passionately that Aminta withdrew it at once. She\r\nhowever veiled her action with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Since,\" said she, \"you are so well, my mother and I wish you henceforth\r\nto be at liberty, and that you should have no domestic duty. You shall\r\nbe our chasseur, and supply us with game--for that is the only thing in\r\nwhich you take pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nA feeling of pride was legible on Tonio's features. He took Aminta's\r\nhand again, and, as a token of gratitude, placed it on his heart. He\r\nthen looked proudly around on the peasants and servants, and finally\r\nmingled with the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe day advanced, and the guests of Signora Rovero came to the villa.\r\nCount Brignoli and Gaetano were not the last. Maulear could not restrain\r\nan expression of mortification when he saw the latter, who, however,\r\nlooking on him as a family friend, treated him most cordially and\r\naffectionately. Maulear at dinner sat next to the Signora Rovero. He\r\nwould have preferred the one usually given him, next to Aminta. He had,\r\nhowever, one consolation. Aminta, seated at a distance from Gaetano,\r\ncould not maintain one of those private conversations with young\r\nBrignoli, which made him so unhappy. Often during the meal he fancied\r\nthat he saw certain signals of intelligence between the young people,\r\nwho had not yet been able to speak together alone. What however had been\r\na doubt became a certainty when he saw Gaetano point to the garden, and\r\nAminta by a gesture of assent reply to him. He had no doubt there was an\r\nunderstanding between Gaetano and Aminta. He knew their rendezvous. From\r\nthat time Maulear did not lose sight of them, and he suffered every\r\ntorture jealousy can inflict. The shock he received at the discovery was\r\nso great, that he was unable even to reflect. He did not become offended\r\nat the perfidy of Aminta, but was rather distressed by suffering, which\r\nwas as great in the physical point of view as it was in the moral.\r\nReason only returned with reflection.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock the ball commenced. At the instance of Aminta, two of\r\nher young friends went to the piano, and Aminta, taking advantage of\r\ncertain orders she had to give, left the room. Gaetano had already gone.\r\nThe Marquis followed her. For a second he heard the light step, which\r\npassed down the gallery, pause. The door of the vestibule however was\r\nopened, and pointed out the route she had taken. He was afraid by\r\nopening the door of betraying his presence, and therefore went into the\r\ngarden by another direction, and making a short detour, soon was able to\r\nfollow the direction he had seen Aminta take. Passing beneath a group of\r\ntrees which was near the house, Maulear, with an attentive ear, followed\r\nstealthily as a deer the steps of the couple he tracked--though he could\r\nnot see. A demon had taken possession of Maulear's heart, and enkindled\r\nit with rage. Certainly, within a few paces from him he heard a voice.\r\nIt was Aminta's. Another voice answered. It was Gaetano's.\r\n\r\n\"How I love you, dear Gaetano, for what you have told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how happy I am in your pleasure--\"\r\n\r\n\"All then is understood?\" said Aminta.\r\n\r\n\"All.\"\r\n\r\n\"We understand each other, and you will hide nothing from me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your letter,\" said the young girl, \"made me mad with joy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Aminta--\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless, indeed, my mother find out our secrets--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not--the secret will be kept--tonight--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, to-night, certainly--\"\r\n\r\n\"Rely then on me,\" said Gaetano.\r\n\r\nMaulear heard a kiss. It struck on his ear like a dagger, and gave him\r\nsuch pain, that a sigh burst from his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Some one overheard us,\" said Gaetano, \"Go, go.\"\r\n\r\nAminta immediately disappeared. Before Gaetano had time to distinguish\r\nMaulear in his place of concealment, the latter, become aware of the\r\nridiculous part he was playing, hid himself in the thicket, and with his\r\nhair dishevelled, his features distorted, and his heart distressed,\r\nhurried to the house and shut himself up in his own room. His despair\r\nwas indeed great; he fancied he had been laughed at by a coquette, while\r\nhe thought he had been the suitor of an innocent girl. Why did she not\r\ntell me the truth yesterday, when I asked her? said he. Why did she not\r\navow her love of young Brignoli? She dared not confide it to me; because\r\nshe makes a mystery of it to her own mother. Why did she encourage me?\r\nWhy did she speak of hope? What unworthy plan, what improper calculation\r\ninfluenced her? What part did she intend me to play in this drama of\r\ntreason?\r\n\r\nThe old idea of Maulear--that sad fancy that women are only to be\r\ndespised, and which he had conceived from women only worthy of that\r\nestimate--took possession of him. He could not believe he was a victim\r\nof mistake, or that the scene he had witnessed had any other motives\r\nthan guilty ones. Of what else could Gaetano and Aminta speak, than\r\nlove? An hour afterwards, Maulear returned to the drawing-room. His\r\ntoilette was irreproachable, and his face, though pale, was calm. One\r\nwould never have recognized in this elegant gentleman, so calm and\r\ndignified, the person who, an hour before, had heard with such\r\nexcitement the conversation we have just described. Maulear had\r\nreflected, and as soon as his first anger had passed away, had nearly\r\nconceived an aversion for the young girl, whom he had almost adored the\r\nevening before. Revenge, too, would be sweet. To accomplish this,\r\ncalmness, coldness, deliberation were required.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the evening prevented the absence of the actors in\r\nthis scene from having been remarked; besides it was a ball for young\r\npeople, at which men of Maulear's age even were not expected to dance.\r\nGaetano, who was only eighteen, was the true Coryphoeus. Maulear\r\napproached Aminta in the interval between two waltzes.\r\n\r\n\"You have a pleasant anniversary of your birthday,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"A delicious one, Signor, I was never so happy.\"\r\n\r\nAt any other time the answer of Aminta would have delighted Maulear; now\r\nhe fancied she alluded to her love for Gaetano. This idea increased his\r\nanger. Midnight came, and those of the guests who lived at a distance\r\nremained at the villa: the others left. All soon became calm, and the\r\nhouse quiet. One man alone watched, for his bosom was irritated by the\r\nmost exciting thoughts; by anger, despair, and jealousy. He was awake,\r\nand wept bitterly over a passion, which it is true had existed but a few\r\ndays, but yet had taken deep root in his heart.\r\n\r\nHe was awake, and was indignant at the affront put on him. He was awake,\r\nfor he had sworn to be avenged. Thinking that he understood the meaning\r\nof Gaetano's words, he did not doubt but that they had made a\r\n_rendezvous_ for that very night. This rendezvous was not the first, for\r\nMaulear knew the secret of the veil he had found on the terrace on the\r\nfirst night he had passed at Sorrento. The veil belonged to Aminta, and\r\nthe flitting shadow he had seen was the lady's self. Her accomplice was\r\nGaetano. How could he doubt? Interrupted in their first intercourse by\r\nMaulear, they expected on another occasion to be more fortunate. No,\r\ncried he, that shall not be, they will find me between themselves and\r\nhappiness. I wish them to at least learn, that I am not their dupe. I\r\nwill cover her snowy brow with a blush, and avenge myself by disclosing\r\nto her my knowledge of her secret. But how could he surprise them? Would\r\nthey dare to cross the terrace again? Perhaps, though, they can meet\r\nnowhere else. If so, they will brave every thing, and in that case I\r\nmust not alarm them. The Marquis took the taper, which lighted his\r\nchamber, and placed it in a back room, which opened on the interior\r\ncorridor of the house. Carefully opening the terrace window, he took\r\nrefuge behind a group of trees, exactly opposite his room. The clock of\r\nSorrento struck three--the night was clear and brilliant, and the sky\r\nwas strewn with diamond stars--the air was soft and warm. It was a night\r\nfor love and lovers.\r\n\r\nTo Maulear it was a night of agony and torture. All around was so calm\r\nand tranquil that the slightest noise fell on his ear,--he soon heard a\r\ndoor open. Maulear fixed his eyes on the point of the terrace from which\r\nthe sound proceeded--his whole existence seemed concentrated in the\r\nsingle sense of sight. Something cloudlike, vapory and undefinable,\r\nwhich seemed too ethereal for earth, gradually appeared at the extreme\r\nend of the terrace. This mysterious figure seemed to glide, rather than\r\nwalk, towards the place where Maulear was concealed; it approached him\r\nslowly, without motion or sound to betray its steps. Wrapped in long\r\nwhite drapery, like a mantle of vapor, resembling those creations of\r\nOssian which formed often the clouds of evening; in short, one might\r\nhave believed that she had risen from the earth, and had come to\r\ndissolve under the first rays of the sun, or of the moon. The phantom\r\ndisappeared for a few seconds, amidst a dark grove, which projected on\r\nthe terrace the lofty trunks of large forest trees--but when she emerged\r\nfrom their shade, and re-entered that portion of the terrace light and\r\nbrilliant, she approached so near to Maulear, that he was enabled to\r\nexamine and recognize her.\r\n\r\nThis graceful and vapory phantom was Aminta. Maulear expected it, but he\r\nfelt not the less a distressing grief, in thus recognizing her. It\r\nseemed to him that the last plank of the wreck had broken under his\r\nfeet, and that he had fallen into the depth of despair. But soon anger\r\nsmothered the last cry of a love now no longer felt--and Maulear rushed\r\nin pursuit of Aminta, when he saw her, to his great surprise, stop\r\nbefore the window of his apartment. Then reaching out her hand she\r\npushed open the door and entered the room, which was partially lighted\r\nby the moon.\r\n\r\n\"What is she doing,\" said Maulear, with amazement, \"what business has\r\nshe in this room?\"\r\n\r\nAn idea struck him. My presentiment did not deceive me. The first time\r\nshe appeared on this terrace, she was coming to this room which was once\r\noccupied by her lover Gaetano. Crossing the terrace rapidly, he glided\r\nnear the window with rage in his heart and his mind excited--for a\r\nguilty project, which he would had he been cooler have repelled,\r\nattacked him, with all its seductions. Without longer hesitation he\r\nreturned to his room, shut the terrace door, and looked in the dark for\r\nAminta. Aminta, however, sat at a window which the moon did not light,\r\nand which opened on the court of the villa. She seemed to listen\r\nanxiously to some distant noise, perceptible only to her ear. So great\r\nwas her preoccupation that she paid no attention to Maulear's entrance.\r\nSurprised at this statue-like immobility, Maulear approached the young\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"Silence, Marietta,\" said she, without looking around, \"I promised to\r\nsee him go. He has kept his word, for I yet hear, in the distance, the\r\ngallop of his horse. Bring the light and place it in the window. He\r\nknows my room, in which we played so often when we were children, and\r\nfar down the road he will see it burning. My remembering him will please\r\nhim. He will see that, if he watches over me, I pray for him to bring me\r\ngood news to-morrow--Gaetano is so kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gaetano!\" said Maulear, in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes, Gaetano,\" continued the young girl, \"will watch over Taddeo\r\nduring this unfortunate trial, for I know all. But say nothing,\r\nMarietta. Poor Taddeo--Gaetano has told me. His letter, yesterday,\r\ncomforted me. Taddeo is no longer compromised. Gaetano assured me. But\r\nthis evening in the park he confirmed all, and has promised to go to\r\nNaples to be present at the trial.\"\r\n\r\nAminta at once became silent, and sitting in an arm-chair near the\r\nwindow, appeared to sleep soundly, for the noise of her breathing was\r\nalone heard. Maulear, erect, motionless, with an icy brow, neither saw\r\nnor heard. A thousand confused ideas filled his mind. A revelation,\r\nstrange and unforeseen, put an end to his suffering and dissipated his\r\nfears, by exhibiting the incomprehensible mystery under which he had\r\nbeen. Aminta was sleeping. Her sleep was of that somnambulist character,\r\nso common in this country of moral and physical excitement. While\r\ndreaming, Aminta had told and taught him every thing. She was innocent\r\nand pure. Yet in doubt, hesitating as the victim does, who when he\r\nmarches to punishment receives a pardon, wishing to convince himself of\r\nthe reality of all that passed, he went into the next room and came out\r\nwith the light. Directing the rays obliquely so that they fell on the\r\ndowncast lids of Aminta, he placed the lamp at some distance from her,\r\nand saw what till then no man had ever seen. He saw this beautiful\r\ncreature in a night _neglige_, enveloped by clouds of white drapery,\r\nwhich a troubled sleep had gracefully disarranged. He saw a charming\r\nchildlike foot half out of the slipper, glistening silvery in the light.\r\nA prey at once to the greatest agitation and repentance at having\r\nsuspected her, Maulear fell on his knees. The motion thus made or some\r\nother circumstance aroused her.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I?\" said she, looking uncertainly around her; seeing Maulear\r\nat her feet, she continued:\r\n\r\n\"A man here--with me--in my room--\"\r\n\r\nShe sought to rise, but being yet under the influence of the half sleep,\r\nsank again on her chair.\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, Signorina!\" said Maulear, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"You! you! Signor,\" said Aminta, recognizing him and drawing back with\r\nterror. \"You at my feet, at night, for all is dark around us, and the\r\nlight is burning. But where am I? this room--it is the one in which I\r\npromised Gaetano to place the light.\"\r\n\r\nPassing her hand across her brow, to collect her ideas and wipe away her\r\ndoubts, she said:\r\n\r\n\"But this is not my room. I occupy one next to my mother.... Ah, I\r\nremember; it was mine once, but it was given to the Marquis, to you,\"\r\nsaid she, blushing. She arose. \"And this night-dress,\" said she, looking\r\nat her disordered toilette, \"in your presence--Signor,\" added she,\r\nclasping her hands, \"by your honor, I beseech you, tell me how I came\r\nhither.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you slept,\" said the Marquis, seeking to calm her.\r\n\r\n\"As I slept?\" repeated the young girl, \"as I dreamed.--Ah, I see, this\r\nsleep, this waking sleep to which I am often liable. Ah! mother, mother,\r\nwhy did you not watch me?\"\r\n\r\nConcealing her face in her hands, she began to shed tears.\r\n\r\n\"Of what, Signorina, are you afraid? You are under the protection of my\r\nfaith, honor, and love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor, I am lost if any one finds me here. Let me return,\" said she,\r\nattempting to go.\r\n\r\nJust then a horrible cry was uttered out of doors. A mingling of the\r\nlion's roar and wolf's howl, a very jackal's yell. It echoed through the\r\nvilla, and was repeated by all the groves and dells of Sorrento. It was\r\nuttered on the terrace. Thither Aminta and Maulear looked, and saw a\r\nhideous spectacle. The face of Scorpione, pale, and denoting both\r\nill-temper and sickness, was pressed against the closed window. He moved\r\nto and fro, now rising up and then descending, as if he sought some\r\nmeans to open the window and enter the room. His eyes, rendered more\r\nglittering by hatred, cast glances of vengeance on Aminta and Maulear.\r\nHis long wiry fingers passed rapidly across the glass, which was the\r\nonly object that separated them.\r\n\r\nAminta yielding to terror, caused by the sight of the monster, without\r\nany calculation or regard of any thing except the violence of Scorpione,\r\nrushed into Maulear's arms in search of protection and aid.\r\n\r\n\"Right, right,\" said Maulear, \"no danger shall befall you while enfolded\r\nin these arms.\" Taking her then towards the door of the corridor, he\r\nsaid: \"Come, come, no danger can befall you here.\"\r\n\r\nScorpione, however, perceiving what Maulear was about to do, and seeing\r\nhim going towards the door, uttered a second cry more terrible than the\r\nfirst. He broke the glass, and sought to reach the clasp which made the\r\nwindow fast. In the mean time, Maulear had reached the other door, and\r\nwas about to escape. He, however, heard steps hurrying from every\r\ndirection down the corridor. The cries of Scorpione had awakened all the\r\nhouse, and just as the wretch tore open the window and precipitated\r\nhimself into the chamber, relations, friends and guests of the house,\r\nwho had collected on the terrace and corridor, rushed in with him.\r\nSignora Rovero was the last to come.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter!\" cried she, running towards Aminta.\r\n\r\nThe poor tearful mother, not accusing that child whom her heart told her\r\nwas innocent, without anger on her lip or reproach in her eye, sought\r\nonly to shroud Aminta's form in the garments which scarcely sufficed to\r\ncover it, and in a calm and confiding voice listened to the explanations\r\nof Maulear. The collection of all of these people, aroused from their\r\nsleep and grouped in the half-lighted room, was a strange\r\npicture;--Signora Rovero holding her daughter in her arms, Maulear with\r\nhis hand lifted to heaven and protesting that Aminta was innocent,\r\nScorpione with his hands blood-stained by the broken glass, his hair\r\ndisheveled, his looks haggard, and his violence restrained by the\r\nservants, who kept the beast from rushing on the Marquis.\r\n\r\n\"Signora,\" said Maulear, speaking to Aminta's mother, \"on my life and\r\nhonor, I declare to you that this young woman came hither without her\r\nown consent, and led by a blind chance.\"\r\n\r\nMaulear was about to continue, when Aminta recovering her energy, said\r\nwith a voice full of emotion, but in a tone instinct with a pure and\r\nchaste heart:\r\n\r\n\"You need not defend me, Marquis; it is useless to repel suspicion from\r\nme. A young woman of my character and name, the daughter of the Rovero,\r\nneed not justify herself from the imputation of a crime, which she would\r\ndie rather than commit.\"\r\n\r\nShe could say no more, for her strength was exhausted, and the power of\r\nher mind had consumed the artificial and nervous capacity of her body,\r\nwhich was greatly overtasked. Aminta was ill. With her beautiful head\r\nresting on her mother's shoulder, she was taken to her room. All\r\nwithdrew in silence.\r\n\r\nOn the features of some, however, especially of the young men whom\r\nAminta had rejected, an incredulousness of such virtue might have been\r\nread. It was hard to conceive how she came to be at midnight in the room\r\nof the Marquis of Maulear.\r\n\r\nEND OF BOOK III.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by Stringer\r\n& Townsend, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United\r\nStates for the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chambers' Papers for the People.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe welcome the indications, now crowding upon us from every quarter,\r\nthat the people of this country are beginning to feel the importance of\r\ntaking active measures for the establishment and increase of public\r\nlibraries. Large collections of books, open for common use, are at once\r\nthe storehouses and the manufactories of learning and science; they\r\nbring together the accumulated fruits of the experience, the research,\r\nand the genius of other ages and distant nations, as well as of our own\r\ntime and land; and they create the taste, as well as furnish the\r\nindispensable aids for the prosecution of literary and scientific effort\r\nin every department. In great cities they qualify the exclusive spirit\r\nof commercial and professional avocations, and encourage men to steal an\r\nhour from the pursuit of gain, and devote it to the attempt to satisfy a\r\nnatural curiosity and to cultivate an elegant taste. Connected with\r\nliterary and academical institutions, they supply the means and multiply\r\nthe objects of study, and keep alive that enthusiasm in the cause of\r\nletters without which nothing great or permanent can ever be\r\naccomplished. Their establishment is a boon to all classes of society,\r\nand all may find in them both recreation and employment; for as the poet\r\nCrabbe says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Here come the grieved, a change of thought to find;--\r\n    The curious here to feed a craving mind;\r\n    Here the devout their peaceful temple choose;\r\n    And here the poet meets his favoring muse.\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of libraries is involved in obscurity. According to some, the\r\ndistinction of having first made collections of writings belongs to the\r\nHebrews; but others ascribe this honor to the Egyptians. Osymandyas, one\r\nof the ancient kings of Egypt, who flourished some 600 years after the\r\ndeluge, is said to have been the first who founded a library. The temple\r\nin which he kept his books was dedicated at once to religion and\r\nliterature, and placed under the especial protection of the divinities,\r\nwith whose statues it was magnificently adorned. It was still further\r\nembellished by a well-known inscription, for ever grateful to the votary\r\nof literature: on the entrance was engraven, \"The nourishment of the\r\nsoul,\" or, according to Diodorus, \"The medicine of the mind.\" It\r\nprobably contained works of very remote antiquity, and also the books\r\naccounted sacred by the Egyptians, all of which perished amidst the\r\ndestructive ravages which accompanied and followed the Persian invasion\r\nunder Cambyses. There was also, according to Eustathius and other\r\nancient authors, a fine library at Memphis, deposited in the Temple of\r\nPhtha, from which Homer has been accused of having stolen both the\r\n\"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey,\" and afterwards published them as his own.\r\nFrom this charge, however, the bard has been vindicated by various\r\nwriters, and by different arguments.\r\n\r\nBut the most superb library of Egypt, perhaps of the ancient world, was\r\nthat of Alexandria. About the year 290 B. C., Ptolemy Soter, a learned\r\nprince, founded an academy at Alexandria called the Museum, where there\r\nassembled a society of learned men, devoted to the study of philosophy\r\nand the sciences, and for whose use he formed a collection of books, the\r\nnumber of which has been variously computed--by Epiphanius at 54,000,\r\nand by Josephus at 200,000. His son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, an equally\r\nliberal and enlightened prince, collected great numbers of books in the\r\nTemple of Serapis, in addition to those accumulated by his father, and\r\nat his death left in it upwards of 100,000 volumes. He had agents in\r\nevery part of Asia and of Greece, commissioned to search out and\r\npurchase the rarest and most valuable writings; and among those he\r\nprocured were the works of Aristotle, and the Septuagint version of the\r\nJewish Scriptures, which was undertaken at the suggestion of Demetrius\r\nPhalerius, his first librarian. The measures adopted by this monarch for\r\naugmenting the Alexandrian Library were pursued by his successor,\r\nPtolemy Euergetes, with unscrupulous vigor. He caused all books imported\r\ninto Egypt by Greeks or other foreigners to be seized and sent to the\r\nMuseum, where they were transcribed by persons employed for the purpose;\r\nand when this was done, the copies were delivered to the proprietors,\r\nand the originals deposited in the library. He refused to supply the\r\nfamished Athenians with corn until they presented him with the original\r\nmanuscripts of AEschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; and in returning\r\nelegant copies of these autographs, he allowed the owners to retain the\r\nfifteen talents (more than L3000 sterling) which he had pledged with\r\nthem as a princely security. As the Museum, where the library was\r\noriginally founded, stood near the royal palace, in that quarter of the\r\ncity called Brucheion, all writings were at first deposited there; but\r\nwhen this building had been completely occupied with books, to the\r\nnumber of 400,000, a supplemental library was erected within the\r\nSerapeion, or Temple of Serapis, and this gradually increased till it\r\ncontained about 300,000 volumes--making in both libraries a grand total\r\nof 700,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe Alexandrian Library continued in all its splendor until the first\r\nAlexandrian war, when, during the plunder of the city, the Brucheion\r\nportion of the collection was accidentally destroyed by fire, owing to\r\nthe recklessness in the auxiliary troops. But the library of the\r\nSerapeion still remained, and was augmented by subsequent donations,\r\nparticularly by that of the Pergamean Library of 200,000 volumes,[19]\r\npresented by Mark Antony to Cleopatra, so that it soon equalled the\r\nformer, both in the number and in the value of its contents. At length,\r\nafter various revolutions under the Roman Emperors, during which the\r\ncollection was sometimes plundered and sometimes reestablished, it was\r\nutterly destroyed by the Saracens at the command of the Caliph Omar,\r\nwhen they acquired possession of Alexandria in A. D. 642. Amrou, the\r\nvictorious general, was himself inclined to spare this inestimable\r\ntreasury of ancient science and learning, but the ignorant and fanatical\r\ncaliph, to whom he applied for instructions, ordered it to be destroyed.\r\n\"If,\" said he, \"these writings of the Greeks agree with the Koran, they\r\nare useless, and need not be preserved; if they disagree, they are\r\npernicious, and ought to be destroyed.\" The sentence of destruction was\r\nexecuted with blind obedience. The volumes of parchment or papyrus were\r\ndistributed as fuel among the five thousand baths of the city; but such\r\nwas their incredible number, that it took six months to consume them.\r\nThis act of barbarism, recorded by Abulpharagius, is considered somewhat\r\ndoubtful by Gibbon, in consequence of its not being mentioned by\r\nEutychius and Almacin, two of the most ancient chroniclers. It seems\r\ninconsistent, too, with the character of Amrou, as a poet and a man of\r\nsuperior intelligence; but that the Alexandrian Library was thus\r\ndestroyed is a fact generally credited, and deeply deplored by\r\nhistorians. Amrou, as a man of genius and learning, may have grieved at\r\nthe order of the caliph, while, as a loyal subject and faithful soldier,\r\nhe felt bound to obey.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks, as among other nations, the first library consisted\r\nmerely of archives, deposited, for the sake of preservation, in the\r\ntemples of the gods. Pisistratus, the tyrant of Athens, was the first\r\nwho established a public library in his native city, which, we need not\r\nsay, always took the lead in every thing relating to science and\r\nliterature in Greece. Here he deposited the works of Homer, which he had\r\ncollected together with great difficulty and at a very considerable\r\nexpense; and the Athenians themselves were at much pains to increase the\r\ncollection. The fortunes of this library were various and singular. It\r\nwas transported to Persia by Xerxes, brought back by Seleucus Nicator,\r\nplundered by Sylla, and at last restored by the Emperor Hadrian. On the\r\ninvasion of the Roman Empire by the Goths, Greece was ravaged; and on\r\nthe sack of Athens, they had collected all the libraries, and were upon\r\nthe point of setting fire to this funeral pile of ancient learning, when\r\none of their chiefs interposed, and dissuaded them from their design,\r\nobserving, at the same time, that as long as the Greeks were addicted to\r\nthe study of books, they would never apply themselves to that of arms.\r\n\r\nThe first library established at Rome was that founded by Paulus\r\nEmilius, in the year B. C. 167. Having subdued Perses, king of\r\nMacedonia, he enriched the city of Rome with the library of the\r\nconquered monarch, which was subsequently augmented by Sylla. On his\r\nreturn from Asia, where he had successfully terminated the first war\r\nagainst Mithridates, Sylla visited Athens, whence he took with him the\r\nlibrary of Apellicon the Teian, in which were the works of Aristotle and\r\nTheophrastus. Lucullus, another conqueror of Mithridates, was not less\r\ndistinguished by his taste for books. The number of volumes in his\r\nlibrary was immense, and they were written in the most distinct and\r\nelegant manner. But the use which he made of his collection was still\r\nmore honorable to that princely Roman than the acquisition or possession\r\nof it. \"It was a library,\" says Plutarch, \"whose walls, galleries, and\r\ncabinets were open to all visitors; and the ingenious Greeks, when at\r\nleisure, resorted to this abode of the Muses, to hold literary\r\nconversations, in which Lucullus himself loved to join.\" But although\r\nboth Sylla and Lucullus liberally gave public access to their literary\r\ntreasures, still their libraries can, in strictness, be considered as\r\nonly _private_ collections. Among the various projects which Julius\r\nCaesar had formed for the embellishment of Rome, was that of a _public_\r\nlibrary, which should contain the largest possible collection of Greek\r\nand Latin works; and he had assigned to Varro the duty of selecting and\r\narranging them. But this design was frustrated by the assassination of\r\nthe dictator, and the establishment of public libraries did not take\r\nplace in Rome until the reign of Augustus.\r\n\r\nThe honor of having first established these valuable institutions is\r\nascribed by the elder Pliny to Asinius Pollio, who erected a public\r\nlibrary in the Court of Liberty, on the Aventine Hill. The credit which\r\nhe gained thereby was so great, that the emperors became ambitious to\r\nillustrate their reigns by the foundation of libraries, many of which\r\nthey called after their own names. Augustus was himself an author, and\r\nin one of those sumptuous buildings called _Thermoe_, ornamented with\r\nporticoes, galleries, and statues, with shady walks and refreshing\r\nbaths, he testified his love of literature by adding a magnificent\r\nlibrary, which he fondly called by the name of his sister Octavia. The\r\nPalatine Library, formed by the same emperor, in the Temple of Apollo,\r\nbecame the haunt of the poets, as Horace, Juvenal, and Perseus have\r\ncommemorated. There were deposited the corrected books of the Sibyls;\r\nand from two ancient inscriptions, quoted by Lipsius and Pitiscus, it\r\nwould seem that it consisted of two distinct collections--one Greek,\r\nand the other Latin. This library having survived the various\r\nrevolutions of the Roman Empire, existed until the time of Gregory the\r\nGreat, whose mistaken zeal led him to order all the writings of the\r\nancients to be destroyed. The successors of Augustus, though they did\r\nnot equally encourage learning, were not altogether neglectful of its\r\ninterests. Suetonius informs us that Tiberius founded a library in the\r\nnew Temple of Apollo; and we learn from some incidental notices that he\r\ninstituted another, called the Tiberian, in his own house, consisting\r\nchiefly of works relating to the empire and the acts of its sovereigns.\r\nVespasian, following the example of his predecessors, established a\r\nlibrary in the Temple of Peace, which he erected after the burning of\r\nthe city by order of Nero; and even Domitian, in the commencement of his\r\nreign, restored at great expense the libraries which had been destroyed\r\nby the conflagration, collecting copies of books from every quarter, and\r\nsending persons to Alexandria to transcribe volumes in that celebrated\r\ncollection, or to correct copies which had been made elsewhere. But the\r\nmost magnificent of all the libraries founded by the sovereigns of\r\nimperial Rome was that of the Emperor Ulpius Trajanus, from whom it was\r\ndenominated the Ulpian Library. It was erected in Trajan's Forum, but\r\nafterwards removed to the Viminal Hill, to ornament the baths of\r\nDiocletian. In this library were deposited the elephantine books,\r\nwritten upon tablets of ivory, wherein were recorded the transactions of\r\nthe emperors, the proceedings of the senate and Roman magistrates, and\r\nthe affairs of the provinces. It has been conjectured that the Ulpian\r\nLibrary consisted of both Greek and Latin works; and some authors\r\naffirm, that Trajan commanded that all the books found in the cities he\r\nhad conquered should be immediately conveyed to Rome, in order to\r\nincrease his collection. The library of Domitian having been consumed by\r\nlightning in the reign of Commodus, was not restored until the time of\r\nGordian, who rebuilt the edifice, and founded a new library, adding\r\nthereto the collection of books bequeathed to him by Quintus Serenus\r\nSamonicus, the physician, and amounting, it is said, to no fewer than\r\n72,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the imperial libraries, there were others to which the\r\npublic had access in the principal cities and colonies of the empire.\r\nPliny mentions one which he had founded for the use of his countrymen;\r\nand Vopiscus informs us that the Emperor Tacitus caused the historical\r\nwritings of his illustrious namesake to be deposited in the libraries.\r\nThe number of calcined volumes which have been excavated from the ruins\r\nof Herculaneum and Pompeii would also seem to indicate that collections\r\nof books were common in those cities. But the irruptions of the\r\nbarbarians, who overran and desolated the Western Empire, proved more\r\ndestructive to the interests of literature than either volcanoes or\r\nearthquakes, and soon caused the disappearance of those libraries which,\r\nduring several centuries, had been multiplied in Italy. Those of the\r\nEast, however, escaped this devastating torrent; and both Alexandria and\r\nConstantinople preserved their literary treasures, until their capture\r\nby the Saracens and the Turks, who finally subverted the Eastern Empire.\r\n\r\nWhen Constantine the Great made Byzantium the seat of his empire, he\r\ndecorated that city with splendid edifices, and called it after his own\r\nname. Desirous to make reparation to the Christians for the injuries\r\nthey had suffered during the reign of his predecessor, he commanded the\r\nmost diligent search to be made after those books which Diocletian had\r\ndoomed to destruction; he caused transcripts to be made of such as had\r\nescaped the fury of the pagan persecutor; and, having collected others\r\nfrom various quarters, he formed the whole into a library at\r\nConstantinople. At the death of Constantine, however, the number of\r\nbooks in the imperial library was only 6900; but it was successively\r\nenlarged by the Emperors Julian and Theodosius the younger, who\r\naugmented it to 120,000 volumes. Of these more than half were burned\r\nduring the seventh century, by command of the Emperor Leo III., who thus\r\nsought to destroy all the monuments that might be quoted in proof\r\nrespecting his opposition to the worship of images. In this library was\r\ndeposited the only authentic copy of the proceedings at the Council at\r\nNice; and it is also said to have contained the poems of Homer written\r\nin gold letters, together with a magnificent copy of the Four Gospels,\r\nbound in plates of gold, enriched with precious stones, all of which\r\nperished in the conflagration. The convulsions which distracted the\r\nlower empire were by no means favorable to the interests of literature.\r\nIn the eleventh century learning flourished for a short time during the\r\nreign of Constantine Porphyrogennetus; and this emperor is said to have\r\nemployed many learned Greeks in collecting books, and forming a library,\r\nthe arrangement of which he himself superintended. But the final\r\nsubversion of the Eastern Empire, and the capture of Constantinople in\r\n1453, dispersed the literati of Greece over western Europe, and placed\r\nthe literary remains of that capital at the mercy of the conqueror. The\r\nimperial library, however, was preserved by the express command of\r\nMohammed, and continued, it is said, to be kept in some apartments of\r\nthe seraglio; but whether it was sacrificed in a fit of devotion by\r\nAmurath IV., as is commonly supposed, or whether it was suffered to fall\r\ninto decay from ignorance and neglect, it is now certain that the\r\nlibrary of the sultan contains only Turkish and Arabic writings, and not\r\na single Greek or Latin manuscript of any importance.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief survey of the most celebrated libraries of ancient\r\ntimes. Before we proceed to describe those of modern days, we shall\r\noffer a few remarks on the extent of ancient as compared with modern\r\ncollections of books. The National Library of Paris contains upwards of\r\n824,000 volumes, and is the largest in existence. It will be easy to\r\nprove that it is the largest that ever has existed.\r\n\r\nThe number of writers, and consequently of books, in the bright days of\r\nEgypt, Greece, and Rome, could not have been very great. It must, on the\r\ncontrary, have been limited by various causes, which contributed\r\npowerfully to retard the composition of new works, and prevent the\r\nmultiplication of new editions. In fact, the histories of cities and of\r\nnations, together with descriptions of the earth, which have become\r\nexhaustless sources for the writers of modern times, must have been but\r\nsterile themes at a period in which history was confined within the\r\nlimits of a few centuries, and hardly a sixth part of the world now\r\nknown had been discovered. Add to these considerations the difficulties\r\nof communication, by which the inhabitants of different countries, and\r\noften those of different sections of the same country, were kept apart,\r\ntogether with the number of arts and sciences which were either wholly\r\nunknown, or confined within very narrow bounds, and it will become\r\nevident, that for every thirty or forty authors of the present day,\r\nancient Europe could hardly have supported one or two.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which may be adduced in support of our proposition,\r\nis the fact, that an increase in the number of readers leads to a\r\nproportionate augmentation in the number of works prepared for their\r\ngratification. We have every reason to suppose that the reading class of\r\nthe ancient world was small in comparison with that of the modern. Even\r\nsetting aside the circumstance of the narrow limits by which the\r\ncreative literature of ancient Europe was bounded--Greece and Rome being\r\nalmost the only nations whence new productions were derived--we shall\r\nstill be constrained to acknowledge the vast distance which separates\r\nthe creative literary power of modern from that of ancient times. Our\r\nschools, which abound with such a variety of class-books upon every\r\nsubject, bear little or no resemblance to those of Greece and Rome; nor\r\ncan the text-books prepared for our universities be brought into\r\ncomparison with the oral instructions of the old philosophers. Passing\r\nby, also, the subjects which have been opened to our research by the\r\ndiscoveries of modern science, and confining our attention to the single\r\nbranch of philosophy, in the old sense of the word, which has always\r\nbeen more or less studied and disputed upon since the days of the\r\nearliest Greeks, we shall probably find that the productions of any one\r\nmodern school outnumber those of the whole body of Greek philosophers.\r\nHow much more would the balance lean towards the moderns were we to add\r\nall the varieties of the French, German, English, and Scottish schools,\r\nto say nothing of those whose tenacious subtleties have procured them\r\nthe name of schoolmen! If, going a step further, we consider that\r\nreading, which the peculiar cast of modern civilization has classed\r\namong the luxuries of life, is one of those luxuries, in the enjoyment\r\nof which all classes come in for a share, we shall find here also a wide\r\ndistinction between ancient times and our own. During that epoch of\r\nsplendid decay, in which the immense wealth of the Roman senators was\r\nfound insufficient to satisfy the longings for new forms of stimulant\r\nand of pleasure, their reading, as we are told by Ammianus Marcellinus,\r\na contemporary historian, was confined to the writings of Marius Maximus\r\nand Juvenal. What would they not have given for a modern novel, or to\r\nwhat unlimited extent would the imagination have poured forth its\r\nfantastic creations, had the art of printing been at hand to keep pace\r\nwith the productive powers of the mind, and the cravings of a morbid\r\nintellect? On every score, therefore, the numerical difference between\r\nthe intellectual wealth of ancient and of modern Europe must have been\r\ndecidedly in favor of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe high price of the materials for writing, and the difficulty of\r\nprocuring them, must also have been a great obstacle to the\r\nmultiplication of books. When copies could only be procured by the slow\r\nand expensive process of transcription, it seems impossible to suppose\r\nthat a large number could have been usually prepared of any ordinary\r\nwork. Those of our readers who are aware that only about four hundred\r\nand fifty copies of the celebrated _Princeps_ editions were struck off,\r\nwill readily assent to the correctness of this opinion. The barbarous\r\nsystem of ancient warfare must have also caused the destruction of a\r\ngreat many works, raised the price of others, and rendered extremely\r\ndifficult--not to say impossible--the accumulation of a very large\r\nnumber in any one place. The difficulties which the bibliomaniacs of our\r\nown times encounter in procuring copies of the editions of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and the extravagant prices at which some of them have been\r\nsold, are enough to show how small a part of an entire edition has been\r\nable to pass safely through the short space of four centuries. How few\r\ncopies, then, of a work written in the time of Alexander, could have\r\nreached the age of Augustus or of Trajan! With facts like these before\r\nus, how can we talk of libraries of 700,000 or 800,000 volumes in the\r\nancient world? When we find it so difficult at the present day, in spite\r\nof the testimony of intelligent travellers, and of all the advantages we\r\npossess for making our estimates, to ascertain the truth with regard to\r\nthe great libraries of modern Europe, how can we give credit to the\r\ncontradictory and exaggerated statements which were promulgated in ages\r\nof the darkest ignorance concerning ancient Rome and Alexandria? \"After\r\nan attentive examination of this subject,\" says that eminent\r\nbibliographer M. Balbi, \"it seems to me improbable, if I should not\r\nrather say impossible, that any library of ancient Europe, or of the\r\nmiddle ages, could have contained more than 300,000 or 400,000 volumes.\"\r\n\r\nBut even allowing 700,000 volumes to the largest of the Alexandrian\r\nlibraries--that, namely, of which a great part was accidentally\r\ndestroyed during the wars of Julius Caesar--allowing the same number to\r\nthe library of Tripoli, and to that of Cairo; and admitting that the\r\nthird library of Alexandria contained 600,000 volumes, and the Ulpian of\r\nRome, and the Cordovan founded by Al-Hakem, an equal number--it will\r\nstill be easy to show that the whole amount of one of these was not\r\nequal to even a fifth part of a library composed of printed books.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has had any thing to do with publication, is well aware of\r\nthe great difference between the space occupied by the written and that\r\nfilled by the printed letters. It is well known that the volumes of\r\nancient libraries consisted of rolls, which generally were written only\r\non one side. Thus the written surface of one of these volumes would\r\ncorrespond to but half the written surface of one of our books, of which\r\nevery page is covered with letters. A library, then, composed of 100,000\r\nrolls, would contain no more matter than one of our libraries composed\r\nof 50,000 manuscripts. It is well known, also, that a work was divided\r\ninto as many rolls as the books which it contained. Thus the Natural\r\nHistory of Pliny, which in the _Princeps_ edition of Venice forms but\r\none folio volume, would, since it is divided into thirty-seven books,\r\nhave formed thirty-seven rolls or volumes. If it were possible to\r\ncompare elements of so different a nature, we should say that these\r\nrolls might be compared to the sheets of our newspapers, or to the\r\nnumbers of our weekly serials. What would become of the great library of\r\nParis were we to suppose its 824,000 volumes in folio, quarto, &c., to\r\nbe but so many numbers of five or six sheets each? Yet this is the rule\r\nby which we ought to estimate the literary wealth of the great libraries\r\nof ancient times; and \"hence,\" says M. Balbi, \"notwithstanding the\r\nimposing array of authorities which can be brought against us, we must\r\npersist in believing that no library of antiquity, or of the middle\r\nages, can be considered as equivalent to a modern one of 100,000 or\r\n110,000 volumes.\"\r\n\r\nNo one of the libraries of the first class now in existence dates beyond\r\nthe fifteenth century. The Vatican, the origin of which has been\r\nfrequently carried back to the days of St. Hilarius in 465, cannot with\r\nany propriety be said to have deserved the name of library before the\r\nreign of Pope Martin V., by whose order it was removed in 1417 from\r\nAvignon to Rome. And even then a strict attention to exactitude would\r\nrequire us to withhold from it this title until the period of its final\r\norganization by Nicholas V. in 1447. It is difficult to speak with\r\ncertainty concerning the libraries, whether public or private, supposed\r\nto have existed previous to the fifteenth century, both on account of\r\nthe doubtful authority and indefiniteness of the passages in which they\r\nare mentioned, and the custom which so readily obtained in those dark\r\nages of dignifying with the name of library every petty collection of\r\ninsignificant codices. But many libraries of the fifteenth century being\r\nin existence, and others having been preserved long enough to make them\r\nthe subject of historical inquiry before their dissolution, it becomes\r\neasier to fix with satisfactory accuracy the date of their foundation.\r\nWe find, accordingly, that during the fifteenth century ten libraries\r\nwere formed: the Vatican at Rome, the Laurentian at Florence, the\r\nImperial of Vienna and Ratisbon, the University at Turin, the\r\nMalatestiana at Cesena, the Marciana at Venice, the Bodleian at Oxford,\r\nthe University at Copenhagen, and the City at Frankfort on the Maine.\r\nThe Palatine of Heidelberg was founded in 1390, dispersed in 1623,\r\nrestored in 1652, and augmented in 1816.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the libraries of Europe has generally been slowly\r\nprogressive, although there have been periods of sudden augmentation in\r\nnearly all of them. They began with a small number of manuscripts;\r\nsometimes with a few, and often without any printed works. To these\r\ngradual accessions were made from the different sources which have\r\nalways been more or less at the command of sovereigns and nobles. In\r\n1455 the Vatican contained 5000 manuscripts. In 1685, after an interval\r\nof more than two centuries, the number of its manuscripts had only risen\r\nto 16,000, and that of the printed volumes did not exceed 25,000. In\r\n1789, but little more than a century later, the number of manuscripts\r\nhad been doubled, and the printed volumes amounted to 40,000.\r\n\r\nFar different was the progress of the Royal, or as it is now called, the\r\nNational Library of Paris. The origin of this institution is placed in\r\nthe year 1595--the date of its removal from Fontainebleau to Paris by\r\norder of Henry IV. In 1660 it contained only 1435 printed volumes. In\r\nthe course of the following year this number was raised to 16,746, both\r\nprinted volumes and manuscripts. During the ensuing eight years the\r\nlibrary was nearly doubled; and before the close of the subsequent\r\ncentury, it was supposed to have been augmented by upwards of 100,000\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the chief sources of these augmentations have been\r\nindividual legacies and the purchase of private collections. Private\r\nlibraries, as our readers are doubtless well aware, began to be formed\r\nlong before public ones were thought of. Like these, they have their\r\norigin in the taste, or caprice, or necessities of their founders, and\r\nare of more or less value, as one or the other of these motives has\r\npresided over their formation. But when formed by private students with\r\na view to bring together all that has been written upon some single\r\nbranch of science, or by amateurs skilled in the principles of\r\nbibliography, they become more satisfactory and complete than they could\r\npossibly be made under any other circumstances. Few of them, however,\r\nare preserved long after the death of the original collector; but\r\nfalling into the hands of heirs possessed of different tastes and\r\nfeelings, are either sold off by auction, or restored to the shelves of\r\nthe bookseller. It was by availing themselves of such opportunities that\r\nthe directors of the public libraries of Europe made their most\r\nimportant acquisitions. This is, in short, the history of the Imperial\r\nLibrary of Vienna; and it can hardly be necessary to add, that it was\r\nthus that the rarest and most valuable portions of that collection were\r\nbrought together.[20] It was thus, also, that the Vatican acquired, some\r\ntwenty years ago, by the purchase of the library of Count Cicognara, a\r\nbody of materials illustrative of the history of the arts, which leaves\r\ncomparatively little to be wished for by the most diligent historian. It\r\ncan hardly be necessary to enlarge upon this subject. Every one who has\r\nengaged, even in a small degree, in historical researches, must have\r\nobserved how soon he gets out of the track of common readers, and how\r\ndark and difficult his way becomes, unless he chance to meet with some\r\nguide among those who, confining their attention to a single branch of\r\nstudy, have become familiar with, and gathered around them almost every\r\nthing which can serve to throw light upon it. And when a public\r\ninstitution has gone on through a long course of years adding to the\r\nworks derived from other sources these carefully chosen stores of the\r\nlearned, it is easy to conceive how much it must contribute, not merely\r\ntowards the gratification of literary curiosity, but to the actual\r\nprogress of literature.\r\n\r\nFrom these general considerations respecting modern libraries, we\r\nproceed to give some particulars which may serve to convey an idea of\r\nthe history, character, and contents of the principal book-collections\r\nnow in existence; and with this view, as well as for convenient\r\nreference, we shall arrange them under the respective heads of British\r\nLibraries, and Foreign Libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n1. _British Museum Library, London._--There is probably no other public\r\ninstitution in Great Britain which is regarded with so great and general\r\ninterest as the British Museum. By the variety of its departments, this\r\nsplendid national depository of literature, and objects of natural\r\nhistory and antiquities, meets in some way the particular taste of\r\nalmost every class of society. The department of Natural History, in its\r\nthree divisions of Zoology, Botany, and Mineralogy, contains a\r\ncollection of specimens unsurpassed, probably unequalled, in the world.\r\nThe department of antiquities is in some particulars unrivalled for the\r\nnumber and value of the articles it contains. But the library is the\r\ncrowning glory of the whole. If, in respect to the number of volumes it\r\ncontains, it does not yet equal the National Library of Paris, the Royal\r\nLibrary of Munich, or the Imperial Library of St. Petersburg--in almost\r\nevery other respect, such as the value and usefulness of the books, the\r\narrangements for their convenient and safe keeping, and, in fact, in\r\nevery matter pertaining to its internal arrangements, the library of the\r\nBritish Museum, by the concurrent testimony of competent witnesses from\r\nvarious countries, must take rank above all similar institutions in the\r\nworld. Well may the people of this country regard the Museum with pride\r\nand pleasure. The liberal grants of parliament, and the munificent\r\nbequests of individuals, are sure indications of a strong desire and\r\npurpose to continue and extend its advantages.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the magnitude of the Museum, and of its vast resources, may\r\nbe formed by considering that the buildings alone in which this great\r\ncollection is deposited have cost, since the year 1823, nearly L700,000;\r\nand the whole expenditure for purchases, exclusive of the cost of the\r\nbuildings just named, is considerably more than L1,100,000. Besides this\r\nliberal outlay by the British Government, there have been numerous\r\nmagnificent bequests from individuals. The acquisitions from private\r\nmunificence were estimated, for the twelve years preceding 1835, at not\r\nless than L400,000. The latest considerable bequest was that of the\r\nRight Hon. Thomas Grenville: his library, which he gave to the Museum\r\nentire, was valued at L50,000. The annual receipts of the institution of\r\nlate years, from parliamentary grants and the interest of private\r\nlegacies, have been about L50,000. The number of visitors to the Museum\r\nis immense. In the year 1848 they amounted to 897,985, being an average\r\nof about 3000 visitors per day for every day the Museum is open. On\r\nspecial occasions there have been as many as thirty thousand visitors on\r\na single day.\r\n\r\nThis noble institution may be said to have originated in the bequest of\r\nSir Hans Sloane, who, dying in 1752, left his immense collections of\r\nevery kind to the nation, on the condition of paying L20,000 in legacies\r\nto different individuals; a sum considerably less than the intrinsic\r\nvalue of the medals, coins, gems, and precious metals of his museum.\r\nThis bequest included a library of 50,000 volumes, among which were 3566\r\nvolumes of manuscripts in different languages; a herbarium of 334\r\nvolumes; other objects of natural history, to the number of\r\nsix-and-thirty or forty thousand, and the house at Chiswick, in which\r\nthe whole was deposited. The Harleian collection of manuscripts,\r\namounting to 7600 volumes, chiefly relating to the history of England,\r\nand including, among many other curious documents, 40,000 ancient\r\ncharters and rolls, being about the same time offered for sale,\r\nparliament voted a sum of L30,000, to be raised by lottery, and vested\r\nin trustees, for the establishment of a National Museum. Of this money,\r\nL20,000 were paid to the legatees of Sir Hans Sloane, L10,000 were given\r\nfor the Harleian Manuscripts, and L10,000 for Montague House as a\r\nreceptacle for the whole. Sloane's Museum was removed thither with the\r\nconsent of his trustees. In 1757, George II., by an instrument under the\r\ngreat seal, added the library of the kings of England, the printed books\r\nof which had been collected from the time of Henry VII., the manuscripts\r\nfrom a much earlier date. This collection was very rich in the\r\nprevailing literature of different periods, and it included, amongst\r\nothers, the libraries of Archbishop Cranmer, and of the celebrated\r\nscholar Isaac Casaubon. His majesty annexed to his gift the privilege\r\nwhich the royal library had acquired in the reign of Queen Anne, of\r\nbeing supplied with a copy of every publication entered at Stationers'\r\nHall; and in 1759 the British Museum was opened to the public.[21]\r\n\r\nThe value of the library has been greatly enhanced by magnificent\r\ndonations, and by immense parliamentary purchases. In 1763, George III.\r\nenriched it with a collection of pamphlets and periodical papers,\r\npublished in England between 1640 and 1660, and chiefly illustrative of\r\nthe civil wars in the time of Charles I., by whom the collection was\r\ncommenced. Among other valuable acquisitions may be mentioned Garrick's\r\ncollection of old English plays, Mr. Thomas Tyrwhitt's library, Sir\r\nWilliam Musgrave's collection of biography, the general library of the\r\nRev. C. M. Cracherode, the libraries of M. Ginguene, Baron de Moll, Dr.\r\nBurney, and Sir R. C. Hoare; and above all, the bequest of Major Arthur\r\nEdwards, who left to it his noble library, and L7000 as a fund for the\r\npurchase of books. Four separate collections of tracts, illustrative of\r\nthe revolutionary history of France, have been purchased at different\r\ntimes by the trustees, in the exercise of the powers with which they are\r\ninvested. One of these was the collection formed by the last president\r\nof the parliament at Bretagne, at the commencement of the revolution;\r\ntwo others extended generally throughout the whole revolutionary period;\r\nand the fourth consisted of a collection of tracts, published during the\r\nreign of the Hundred Days in 1815--forming altogether a body of\r\nmaterials for the history of the revolution as complete in regard to\r\nFrance as the collection of pamphlets and tracts already mentioned is\r\nwith respect to the civil wars of England in the time of Charles I.\r\nAnother feature of the Museum Library is its progressive collection of\r\nnewspapers, from the appearance of the first of these publications in\r\n1588. Sir Hans Sloane had formed a great collection for his day. But to\r\nthis was added, in 1818, the Burney collection, purchased at the\r\nestimated value of L1000; and since that period the Commissioners of\r\nStamps have continued regularly to forward to the Museum, copies of all\r\nnewspapers deposited by the publishers in their office.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, the Royal Library collected by George III. was presented to the\r\nBritish nation by his successor George IV., and ordered by parliament to\r\nbe added to the library of the British Museum, but to be kept for ever\r\nseparate from the other books in that institution. The general plan of\r\nits formation appears to have been determined on by George III., soon\r\nafter his accession to the throne; and the first extensive purchase made\r\nfor it was that of the library of Mr. Joseph Smith, British consul at\r\nVenice, in 1762, for which his majesty paid about L10,000. In 1768 Mr.\r\n(afterwards Sir Frederick) Barnard, the librarian, was despatched to the\r\ncontinent by his majesty; and as the Jesuits' houses were then being\r\nsuppressed and their libraries sold throughout Europe, he was enabled to\r\npurchase, upon the most advantageous terms, a great number of very\r\nvaluable books, including some very remarkable rarities, in France,\r\nItaly, and Germany. Under the judicious directions of Mr. Barnard, the\r\nentire collection was formed and arranged; it was enlarged during a\r\nperiod of sixty years, by an annual expenditure of about L2000, and it\r\nis in itself, perhaps, one of the most complete libraries of its extent\r\nthat was ever formed. It contains selections of the rarest kind,\r\nparticularly of scarce books which appeared in the first ages of the art\r\nof printing. It is rich in early editions of the classics, in books from\r\nthe press of Caxton, in English history, and in Italian, French, and\r\nSpanish literature; and there is likewise a very extensive collection of\r\ngeography and topography, and of the transactions of learned academies.\r\nThe number of books in this library is 65,250, exclusively of a very\r\nnumerous assortment of pamphlets; and it appears to have cost, in direct\r\noutlay, about L130,000, but it is estimated as worth at least L200,000.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of the department of manuscripts at the British Museum was\r\nformed by the Harleian, Sloanean, and Cottonian collections. To these\r\nGeorge II. added, in 1757, the manuscripts of the ancient royal library\r\nof England. Of these, one of the most remarkable is the \"Codex\r\nAlexandrinus;\" a present from Cyril, patriarch of Constantinople, to\r\nKing Charles I. It is in four quarto volumes, written upon fine vellum,\r\nprobably between the fourth and sixth centuries, and is believed to be\r\nthe most ancient manuscript of the Greek Bible now extant. Many of the\r\nother manuscripts came into the royal collection at the time when the\r\nmonastic institutions of Britain were destroyed; and some of them still\r\nretain upon their spare leaves the honest and hearty anathemas which\r\nthe donors denounced against those who should alienate or remove the\r\nrespective volumes from the places in which they had been originally\r\ndeposited. This collection abounds in old scholastic divinity, and\r\npossesses many volumes, embellished by the most expert illuminators of\r\ndifferent countries, in a succession of periods down to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In it are also preserved an assemblage of the domestic\r\nmusic-books of Henry VIII., and the \"Basilicon Doron\" of James I. in his\r\nown handwriting. The Cottonian collection, which was purchased for the\r\nuse of the public in 1701, and annexed by statute to the British Museum\r\nin 1753, consists of 861 manuscript volumes, including \"Madox's\r\nCollections on the Exchequer,\" in ninety-four volumes, besides many\r\nprecious documents connected with our domestic and foreign history,\r\nabout the time of Elizabeth and James. It likewise contains numerous\r\nregisters of English monasteries; a rich collection of royal and other\r\noriginal letters; and the manuscript called the \"Durham Book,\" being a\r\ncopy of the Latin Gospels, with an interlinear Saxon gloss, written\r\nabout the year 800, illuminated in the most elaborate style of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, and believed to have once belonged to the venerable Bede.\r\nThe Harleian collection is still more miscellaneous, though historical\r\nliterature in all its branches forms one of its principal features. It\r\nis particularly rich in heraldic and genealogical manuscripts; in\r\nparliamentary and legal proceedings; in ancient records and abbey\r\nregisters; in manuscripts of the classics, amongst which is one of the\r\nearliest known of Homer's \"Odyssey;\" in missals, antiphonars, and other\r\nservice-books of the Catholic Church; and in ancient English poetry. It\r\npossesses two very early copies of the Latin Gospels, written in gold\r\nletters; and also contains a large number of splendidly illuminated\r\nmanuscripts, besides an extensive mass of correspondence. It further\r\nincludes about three hundred manuscript Bibles or Biblical books, in\r\nHebrew, Chaldaic, Greek, Arabic, and Latin; nearly two hundred volumes\r\nof writings of the fathers of the church; and a number of works on the\r\narts and sciences, among which is a tract on the steam-engine, with\r\nplans, diagrams, and calculations by Sir Samuel Morland. The Sloanean\r\ncollection consists principally of manuscripts on natural history,\r\nvoyages and travels, on the arts, and especially on medicine.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 the collection of manuscripts formed by the first Marquis of\r\nLansdowne was added to these libraries, having been purchased by\r\nparliament for L4925. It consists of 1352 volumes, of which 114 are Lord\r\nBurleigh's state papers, 46 Sir Julius Caesar's collections respecting\r\nthe reigns of Elizabeth and James I., and 108 the historical collections\r\nof Bishop Kennet. Other valuable collections are the classical\r\nmanuscripts of Dr. Charles Burney, the Oriental manuscripts collected by\r\nMessrs. Rich and Hull, and the Egyptian papyri presented by Sir J. G.\r\nWilkinson. It would be endless, however, to enumerate these treasures;\r\nwe have indicated enough to convince our readers that the library of the\r\nBritish Museum is worthy of the nation to which it belongs.\r\n\r\n2. _Bodleian Library, Oxford._--This institution, so called from the\r\nname of its illustrious founder, was established towards the close of\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth by Sir Thomas Bodley, who, having become\r\ndisgusted with some court intrigues, resigned all his employments about\r\nthe year 1597, and resolved to spend the remainder of his life in a\r\nprivate station. Having thought of various plans to render himself\r\nuseful, he says, \"I concluded at the last to set up my staff at the\r\nlibrary door in Oxon, being thoroughly persuaded that in my solitude and\r\nsurcease from the commonwealth affairs, I could not busy myself to\r\nbetter purpose than by reducing that place, which then in every part lay\r\nruined and waste, to the public use of students. For the effecting\r\nwhereof I found myself furnished in a competent proportion of such four\r\nkinds of aids, as, unless I had them all, there was no hope of good\r\nsuccess. For without some kind of knowledge, as well in the learned and\r\nmodern tongues as in sundry other sorts of scholastical literature;\r\nwithout some purse-ability to go through with the charge; without great\r\nstore of honorable friends to further the design; and without special\r\ngood leisure to follow such a work, it could but have proved a vain\r\nattempt and inconsiderate.\" Having set himself this task--\"a task,\" as\r\nhis friend Camden justly says, \"that would have suited the character of\r\na crowned head\"--Bodley despatched from London a letter to the\r\nvice-chancellor, offering not only to restore the building, but to\r\nprovide a fund for the purchase of books, and the maintenance of proper\r\nofficers. This offer being thankfully accepted, he commenced his\r\nundertaking by presenting to the library a large collection of books\r\npurchased on the continent, and valued at L10,000. He also collected\r\n1294 rare manuscripts, which were afterwards increased to 6818,\r\nindependently of 1898 in the Ashmolean Museum. Other collections and\r\ncontributions were also, by his example and persuasion, presented to the\r\nnew library; and the additions thus made soon swelled to such an amount\r\nthat the old building was no longer sufficient to contain them. The\r\nedifice was accordingly enlarged; and Bodley thus had the proud\r\nsatisfaction of seeing Oxford possessed, by his means, of such a library\r\nas might well bear comparison with the proudest in continental Europe.\r\nIt would require a volume to contain an enumeration of the many\r\nimportant additions which have been made to this library by its numerous\r\nbenefactors, or to admit even a sketch of its ample contents in almost\r\nevery branch of literature and science. The Oriental manuscripts are the\r\nrarest and most beautiful to be found in any European collection; and\r\nthe first editions of the classics, procured from the Pinelli and\r\nCrevenna libraries, rival those of Vienna. In a word, it is exceedingly\r\nrich in many departments in which most other libraries are deficient,\r\nand it forms altogether one of the noblest collections of which any\r\nuniversity can boast.\r\n\r\n3. _University Library, Cambridge._--This is a library of considerable\r\nextent, and contains much that is valuable or curious both in the\r\ndepartment of printed books and in that of manuscripts. The printed\r\nbooks comprise a fine series of _editiones principes_ of the classics,\r\nand a very large proportion of the productions of Caxton's press. Among\r\nthe manuscripts contained in it are the celebrated manuscript of the\r\nfour Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, known by the name of the _Codex\r\nBezae_, which was presented to the university by that distinguished\r\nreformer; Magna Charta, written on vellum; and a Koran upon cotton paper\r\nsuperbly executed. In the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, there\r\nare several exceedingly interesting literary curiosities; amongst\r\nothers, some manuscripts in the handwriting of Milton, consisting of the\r\noriginal copy of the \"Masque of Comus,\" several plans of \"Paradise\r\nLost,\" and the poems of \"Lycidas,\" \"Arcades,\" and others; and also Sir\r\nIsaac Newton's copy of his \"Principia,\" with his manuscript notes, and\r\nhis letters to Roger Coles.\r\n\r\n4. _Advocates' Library, Edinburgh._--This library was founded in 1682,\r\nat the instance of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, who was at that\r\ntime Dean of Faculty, and the plan was carried into execution on a small\r\nscale, by a fund which had been formed out of the fines of members. It\r\nwas originally intended that it should consist merely of the works of\r\nlawyers, and of such other books as were calculated to advance the study\r\nof jurisprudence; it now comprehends, in a greater or less degree,\r\nalmost every branch of science, philosophy, jurisprudence, literature,\r\nand the arts. Its collection of historical works is very complete. Among\r\nthe curiosities shown to visitors are a manuscript Bible of St. Jerome's\r\ntranslation, believed to have been written in the eleventh century, and\r\nknown to have been used as the conventual copy of the Scriptures in the\r\nAbbey of Dunfermline; a copy of the first printed Bible, in two volumes,\r\nfrom the press of Faust and Guttenberg; the original Solemn League and\r\nCovenant, drawn up in 1580; and six copies of the Covenant of 1638.\r\nAmong other manuscripts in the collection are the whole of the\r\ncelebrated Wodrow Manuscripts, relating to the ecclesiastical history of\r\nScotland, and the chartularies of many of the ancient religious houses.\r\nFor its extent, no less than for the liberal principles upon which it is\r\nconducted, this deserves the name of the National Library of Scotland.\r\n\r\n5. _Trinity College Library, Dublin._--This library owed its\r\nestablishment to a very curious incident. In the year 1603, the\r\nSpaniards were defeated by the English at the battle of Kinsale;\r\ndetermined to commemorate their victory by some permanent monument, the\r\nsoldiers collected among themselves the sum of L1800, which they agreed\r\nto apply to the purchase of books for a public library, to be founded in\r\nthe then infant institution of Trinity College. This sum was placed in\r\nthe hands of the celebrated Dr. Usher, who immediately proceeded to\r\nLondon, and there purchased the books necessary for the purpose. It is a\r\nremarkable coincidence, that Usher, while occupied in purchasing these\r\nbooks, met in London Sir Thomas Bodley engaged in similar business, with\r\na view to the establishment of his famous library at Oxford. From this\r\ncommencement, the library of Trinity College was, at different periods,\r\nincreased by many valuable donations, including that of Usher's own\r\ncollection, consisting of 10,000 volumes, until at length its growing\r\nmagnitude requiring a corresponding increase of accommodation, the\r\npresent library-hall, a magnificent apartment of stately dimensions, was\r\nerected in the year 1732. Since that time numerous additions have been\r\nmade to the library: amongst others, that of the library of the\r\nPensionary Fagel, in 20,000 volumes, and the valuable classical and\r\nItalian books which had belonged to Mr. Quin; so that, altogether, the\r\nlibrary of Trinity College now forms one of the first order, at least in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThe five libraries thus briefly described are the principal ones in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, and they are all entitled to receive a copy of every new\r\nwork on its publication; so that they are continually on the increase,\r\nand enabled to keep pace with the activity of the press. Of the numerous\r\nother libraries in this country we have no space to give a detailed\r\naccount, and must therefore content ourselves with merely indicating the\r\nnames of the more extensive ones. In London are the libraries of the\r\nRoyal Society and the Royal Institution; Sion College Library;\r\nArchbishop Tenison's Library; and Dr. Williams's Library, belonging to\r\nthe Dissenters. The Lambeth Library of the Archbishop of Canterbury is\r\nexceedingly rich in ecclesiastical history and biblical literature. At\r\nOxford and Cambridge, all the different colleges have libraries more or\r\nless extensive and valuable. Chetham's Library at Manchester is also\r\nworthy of mention. The library of the Writers to the Signet at Edinburgh\r\nis an excellent and valuable miscellaneous collection of books in\r\nscience, law, history, geography, statistics, antiquities, literature,\r\nand the arts. Finally, the Scotch universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow,\r\nSt. Andrews, and Aberdeen, all possess academical libraries of\r\nconsiderable size, and which are steadily on the increase. Many of the\r\nabove receive an annual grant of money from government, as a\r\ncompensation for the withdrawal of the privilege of receiving copies of\r\nevery book published in the kingdom. All such, at least, ought to be\r\nthrown open to the public, and doubtless soon will be.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n1. _National Library, Paris._--This library is justly considered as the\r\nfinest in Europe. It was commenced under the reign of King John, who\r\npossessed only _ten_ volumes, to which 900 were added by Charles V.,\r\nmany of them superbly illuminated by John of Bruges, the best artist in\r\nminiatures of that time. Under Francis I. it had increased to 1890\r\nvolumes, and under Louis XIII. to 16,746. In 1684 it possessed 50,542\r\nvolumes; in 1775 it amounted to above 150,000; and by 1790 it had\r\nincreased to about 200,000. At present it contains 824,000 volumes of\r\nprinted books, and 80,000 manuscripts. It is divided into four\r\ndepartments:--1. Printed books; 2. Manuscripts, charters, and diplomas;\r\n3. Coins, medals, engraved stones, and other antique monuments; and 4.\r\nEngravings, including geographical charts and plans. Of the contents of\r\nthis magnificent, nay, matchless collection, it would far exceed our\r\nlimits to give any details, or even to enumerate its choicest articles.\r\nIt is rich in every branch and department, unique in some, scarcely\r\nsurpassed in any, and unrivalled in all taken together. Of books printed\r\non vellum it contains at once the finest and most extensive collection\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n2. _Arsenal Library, Paris._--This library, founded by the Marquis de\r\nPaulmy, formerly ambassador of France in Poland, was in 1781 acquired by\r\nthe Count d'Artois, who united to it nearly the whole of the library of\r\nthe Duke de la Valliere. It possesses the most complete collection\r\nextant of romances, since their origin in modern literature; of\r\ntheatrical pieces or dramas, from the epoch of the Moralities and\r\nMysteries; and of French poetry since the commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It is less rich in other branches, but it has all works of\r\nimportance, and in particular contains historical collections which are\r\nnot to be found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n3. _Library of Ste Genevieve, Paris._--The foundation of this library\r\ndates as early as the year 1624, when Cardinal de Rochefoucauld, having\r\nreformed the Abbey of Sainte-Genevieve, made it a present of 600\r\nvolumes. At present it contains 160,000 printed volumes and 2000\r\nmanuscripts. In it may be found all the academical collections, and a\r\ncomplete set of Aldines; it is particularly rich in historical works;\r\nand its most remarkable manuscripts are Greek and Oriental. Its\r\ntypographical collections of the fifteenth century are not more valuable\r\nfor their number than the high state of preservation in which they are\r\nfound. This library is open of an evening, and is much resorted to by\r\nstudents, and men of the operative classes.\r\n\r\n4. _Mazarin Library, Paris._--This library, as its name denotes, was\r\ninstituted by Cardinal Mazarin. The formation of it was intrusted to the\r\nlearned Gabriel Naude, who, having first selected all that suited his\r\npurpose in the booksellers' shops in Paris, travelled into Holland,\r\nItaly, Germany, and England, where the letters of recommendation of\r\nwhich he was the bearer enabled him to collect many very rare and\r\ncurious works. Cardinal Mazarin, by his will, bequeathed it to the\r\ncollege which he founded, and in 1688 it was made public. It is\r\nremarkable for a great number of collections containing detached pieces\r\nand small treatises, which date as far back as the fifteenth century,\r\nand exist nowhere else; nor has any other library so complete a body of\r\nthe ancient books of law, theology, medicine, and the physical and\r\nmathematical sciences. It also possesses a most precious collection of\r\nthe Lutheran or Protestant authors. In one of the halls are placed\r\nmodels in relief of the Pelasgic monuments of Italy and Greece; in\r\nanother is a terrestrial globe, eighteen feet in diameter, formed of\r\nplates of copper, and executed by order of Louis XVI.; but this\r\ninstrument, which is unique in Europe, is unfortunately unfinished,\r\nbeing destitute of several requisite circles.\r\n\r\n5. _National Library, Madrid._--This \"is one of the many institutions\r\nwhich awaken the admiration of the stranger in Spain, as being at\r\nvariance with the pervading decay.\" According to Mr. Ford, \"it is rich\r\nin Spanish literature, especially theology and topography, and has been\r\nmuch increased numerically since the suppression of the convents; but\r\ngood modern books are needed.\" It contains many valuable Greek, Latin,\r\nand Arabic manuscripts, and unedited works, chiefly Spanish. _The\r\nMonetario_, or cabinet of medals, is arranged in an elegant and\r\nbeautiful apartment, and contains an unrivalled collection of Celtic,\r\nPhoenician, Greek, Roman, Gothic, Arabic, and modern coins and medals,\r\nin excellent preservation. The library is open to all, at least as far\r\nas the printed books are concerned.\r\n\r\n6. _Vatican Library, Rome._--Among the libraries of Italy, that of the\r\nVatican at Rome stands preeminent, not more for its grandeur and\r\nmagnificence, than for the inestimable treasures with which it is\r\nenriched. It was originated about the year 465 by Pope Hilary, and has\r\nbeen augmented by succeeding pontiffs, and by various princes, until it\r\nreached its present extent and value. Our space will not permit us to\r\ngive any thing like a detailed account of its treasures; but we condense\r\nfrom Sir George Head's admirable work on Rome the following description\r\nof the grand saloon of the library:--\"The principal chamber of the\r\nlibrary appears to be 179 feet long by 51 broad. The ceiling is\r\nremarkable for presenting to the eye the appearance of a uniform\r\nextensive surface, as if it were a beautifully broad elliptical vault,\r\nthough in fact it consists of a double range of groined arches that,\r\nspringing on each side from the walls, and blending together in the\r\nmiddle, are supported on a row of six pillars planted in a line on the\r\nground. These pillars are contrived, accordingly, of an oblong shape, so\r\nextremely narrow that, planted as they are longitudinally, and\r\nencompassed by large rectangular mahogany bookcases to serve as\r\npedestals, they occupy but an inconsiderable space in the apartment when\r\nviewed edgewise by a spectator standing at the entrance, and from their\r\nform effectually counteract the appearance of weight, that would\r\ncertainly otherwise be produced by the double vaulting. Moreover, while\r\nthe lines of curvature slide as it were thus gently and harmoniously\r\ninto the outline of the pillars, the transition of surface is the less\r\nperceptible, owing to the whole of the vault and pillars being painted\r\nin a uniform delicate pattern of arabesque, by Zuccari, as it is\r\naffirmed; but at all events, in figures of plants and flowers, almost as\r\nlight and exquisite as the paintings on a china teacup, and thrown into\r\nrelief by the prevalence of a clear white ground; so that an appearance\r\nis produced of airiness and space to all intents and purposes as\r\neffective as if the ceiling were really contained within the span of a\r\nsingle elliptical arch. Along the base of the ceiling is a cornice of\r\nstucco, ornamented with a light pattern in white and gold; and\r\nunderneath, upon the upper portion of the walls, are six windows on each\r\nside; and the remainder of the surface is covered with paintings by\r\nseveral different artists, one of which represents Sixtus V. receiving\r\nfrom his architect, Dominico Fontana, the plan of the present library.\r\nThe lower portion of the walls is entirely occupied by closed bookcases,\r\ncomposed of panels of wood painted in arabesque on a ground of white and\r\nslate color, and surrounded by gilded mouldings; which receptacles bear\r\nno sort of affinity in appearance to ordinary library furniture, and\r\nthoroughly conceal from public view the valuable manuscripts they\r\ncontain. No books, in fact, are to be seen in the whole chamber, and\r\nparticularly the rectangular bookcases above referred to, that serve the\r\npurpose of pedestals, from the middle of which each pillar supporting\r\nthe ceiling and resting on the ground below rise, as the pier of a\r\nbridge from its ceisson, rather resemble ornamental buffets upon whose\r\ntabular surface vases and other splendid objects of art and antiquity\r\nare arranged in order.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the principal objects worthy of observation there are,\r\nin the first place, two very magnificent tables, both alike, placed in\r\nthe middle of the room in a corresponding position to one another,\r\nbetween the first and second pillar at each extremity. Each is composed\r\nof an enormously thick and very highly polished slab of red Oriental\r\ngranite, supported by six bronze figures of slaves as large as life.\r\nSuch being the appropriation of two of the intercolumnial spaces, a\r\nthird is occupied by a low column of Cipollino marble, serving as a\r\npedestal to support a splendid and very large vase of Sevres china,\r\nwhich was presented by the Emperor Napoleon to Pius VII. In a fourth\r\nintercolumnial space is to be seen, supported on a pedestal of\r\nCipollino, whose base appears to be a sort of alabaster marked with\r\ndifferent shades of olive-green, a square tazza of malachite, presented\r\nto Gregory XVI. by the Crown-Prince of Russia, after his visit to Rome\r\nin 1838. In the fifth intercolumnial space are a magnificent pair of\r\ncandelabra of Sevres china, brought by Pius VII. from Paris, and also a\r\nsplendid vase of the same material presented to his holiness by Charles\r\nX. There is also to be observed, placed at the extremity of the room, on\r\nthe right-hand side near the wall, a spirally fluted column of Oriental\r\nalabaster, which was discovered near the church of St. Eusebio, on the\r\nEsquiline; and suspended against the wall, not far distant, is a curious\r\nold Russian calendar painted on wood.\r\n\r\n\"The bookcases being continually locked, as above stated, permission is\r\nnevertheless granted to those visitors who may be desirous of consulting\r\nthe books and manuscripts, on making application to the\r\ncardinal-librarian or his assistants; but the privilege is merely\r\nnominal, in consequence of the extremely imperfect state of the\r\ncatalogue; and in point of fact the multitudinous volumes on the shelves\r\nmay be compared to a mine, unexplored and unexplorable; whence only a\r\nfew particular objects, considered the staple curiosities of the region,\r\nand consequently continually had recourse to by the visitors, are\r\nextracted. The volumes in question consist principally of a\r\nsplendidly-illuminated Bible of the sixth century; the most ancient\r\nversion of the Septuagint; the earliest Greek version of the New\r\nTestament; the 'Assertio Septem Sacramentorum,' written by Henry\r\nVIII.--a royal literary effort in defence of the seven Roman Catholic\r\nsacraments that procured the title of Defender of the Faith for the\r\nauthor, which descended to the Protestant monarchs of England; and a\r\nmost curious and authentic collection of original correspondence between\r\nHenry VIII. and Anne Boleyn. The 'Assertio Septem Sacramentorum' is a\r\ngood thick octavo volume, written in Latin, and printed in the year\r\n1501, in London, on vellum. The type is clear, with a broad margin, and\r\nat the beginning is the original presentation addressed to Leo X., as\r\nfollows, subscribed by the royal autograph--\r\n\r\n    'Anglorum Rex Henricus Leo Decime mittit\r\n      Hoc opus, et fidei testis et amicitiae.'\r\n\r\nThe whole work--in the preface of which the writer descants on his\r\nhumble talents and his modesty--would seem, as far as I was able to\r\njudge by turning over the pages hastily, to be composed in a remarkably\r\nclear style, and to abound with naive phrases and genuine expressions of\r\nthe king himself, wrought into the mass and substance of a prolix\r\ntheological dissertation, that no doubt was prepared and digested for\r\nthe purpose by the divines of the period. With regard to the\r\ncorrespondence with Anne Boleyn, which places the royal author\r\naltogether in a different point of view before the public, the latter\r\nconsists of a considerable number of original letters, of which those\r\nwritten by the king are for the most part in French and the remainder in\r\nEnglish, and those of Anne Boleyn written all in French. The documents\r\nare all in excellent preservation, and the handwriting perfectly\r\nlegible; from the difference of the character at the period in question,\r\nand owing to the abbreviations, somewhat difficult to decipher; not so\r\nmuch so, however, but that even an unpractised person, with sufficient\r\ntime and leisure, might make them out without much difficulty. Visitors\r\nare relieved from the labor of the experiment; and fair copies, made in\r\na clear round hand, are placed, each copy side by side with the\r\noriginal, and all are stitched together in a portfolio, where they may\r\nbe perused with the utmost facility. The letters, which to those\r\ninclined to ponder on the anatomy of the human heart afford a melancholy\r\nmoral, are chiefly remarkable for the boisterous eager tone of the\r\nking's passion towards his lady-love, which, expressed in terms that\r\nwould hardly be considered proper now-a-days, verges on the grotesque.\"\r\n\r\n7. _Casanata Library, Rome._--This library, founded by Cardinal Girolamo\r\nCasanata in the year 1700, is said to contain a greater number of\r\nprinted books exclusively, in contradistinction to manuscripts, than any\r\nother in Rome, not excepting the Vatican. \"The library,\" says Sir George\r\nHead, \"is a very beautifully-proportioned chamber, upwards of fifty feet\r\nin breadth, and long in proportion, with an elliptically-vaulted\r\nceiling, along the base of which are a series of acute-angled arched\r\nspaces containing windows that throw an admirable light on the\r\napartment, which is whitewashed most brilliantly. The books are ranged\r\nall round the room on open shelves, with a communication to those of the\r\nupper row by a pensile gallery that surrounds the whole periphery. At\r\nthe extremity of the room is a white marble statue, by Le Gros, of\r\nCardinal Casanata, the founder, elevated with remarkably good effect on\r\na pedestal of dark-colored Brazil-wood, very highly polished, and\r\nsurmounted by a splendid frontispiece, supported on two pair of fluted\r\nCorinthian columns, all of the same material. The door of the room at\r\nthe entrance is also surmounted by a frontispiece and columns of\r\nBrazil-wood, similar to the preceding. The librarian, a Dominican friar,\r\ndressed in the habit of his order, and seated in an easy-chair in the\r\nmiddle of the room at his desk of office, attends there continually, and\r\nis exceedingly kind and attentive to the applications of strangers who\r\nwish to read books in the library, though his good intentions are of\r\nlittle avail, from the want of a proper catalogue.\"\r\n\r\n8. _Laurentian Library, Florence._--This institution was commenced by\r\nCosmo de Medici, the father of a line of princes whose name and age are\r\nalmost synonymous with the restoration of learning. Naturally fond of\r\nliterature, and anxious to save from destruction the precious remains of\r\nclassical antiquity, he laid injunctions on all his friends and\r\ncorrespondents, as well as on the missionaries who travelled into remote\r\ncountries, to search for and procure ancient manuscripts in every\r\nlanguage and on every subject. He availed himself of the services of all\r\nthe learned men of his time; and the situation of the Eastern empire,\r\nthen daily falling into ruins by the repeated attacks of the Turks,\r\nafforded him an opportunity of obtaining many inestimable works in the\r\nHebrew, Greek, Chaldaic, Arabic, and Indian languages. From these\r\nbeginnings arose the celebrated library of the Medici, which, after\r\nhaving been the constant object of the solicitude of its founder, was\r\nafter his death further enriched by the attention of his descendants,\r\nand particularly of his grandson Lorenzo; and after various vicissitudes\r\nof fortune, and frequent and considerable additions, has been preserved\r\nto the present day--the noblest monument which its princely founders\r\nhave left of the glory of their line.\r\n\r\n9. _Magliabecchian Library, Florence._--Antonio Magliabecchi, from being\r\na servant to a dealer in vegetables, raised himself to the honorable\r\noffice of librarian to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and became one of the\r\nmost eminent literary characters of his time. The force of natural\r\ntalent overcame all the disadvantages of the humble condition in which\r\nhe had been born, and placed him in a situation to make his name known\r\nand respected. But he endeavored to deserve still better of his\r\ncountrymen, by presenting them, shortly before his death in 1714, with\r\nhis large and valuable collection of books, together with the remainder\r\nof his fortune, as a fund for its support. This constituted the\r\nfoundation of the Magliabecchian Library, which, by the subsequent\r\ndonations of several benefactors, and the bounty of some of the grand\r\ndukes of Florence, has been so much increased both in number and value\r\nthat it may now vie with some of the most considerable collections in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n10. _Imperial Library, Vienna._--This collection is perhaps inferior\r\nonly to that of the Vatican, and the National Library at Paris, for the\r\nrarity and value of its contents. It was founded by the Emperor\r\nFrederick III., who spared no expense to enrich it with printed books as\r\nwell as manuscripts in every language. By the munificence of succeeding\r\nemperors, numerous important and valuable accessions were made to the\r\ncollection; amongst which may be mentioned the large and interesting\r\nlibrary of Prince Eugene, and a considerable portion of the Buda\r\nLibrary, founded by Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary. The Imperial\r\nLibrary occupies eight spacious apartments, and a ninth is appropriated\r\nto a very valuable collection of medals and other curiosities. Besides\r\nthe cabinet of medals, there is also attached to the library a superb\r\ncollection of engravings, consisting of 473 large folio volumes, 510\r\nvolumes of different sizes, and 215 folio cartoons. The collection of\r\nmusic contains upwards of 6000 volumes, theoretical and practical; and\r\nthat of autographs exceeds 8000 pieces, classed under the heads of\r\nmonarchs and princes, ministers and statesmen, poets, philosophers, and\r\nmen of learning or science, generals and renowned warriors, artists,\r\nmusicians, and others.\r\n\r\n11. _Royal Library, Munich._--This is the most extensive collection in\r\nGermany. It was founded in 1550, and is very complete in all its\r\ndepartments. The ancient manuscripts relative to the art of music amount\r\nto a great number, and are exceedingly curious.\r\n\r\n12. _University Library, Gottingen._--The library attached to the\r\nUniversity of Gottingen contains 360,000 printed volumes, and 3000\r\nvolumes of manuscripts. But its extent is its least recommendation, for\r\nit is not only the most complete among those of the universities, but\r\nthere are very few royal or public collections in Germany which can\r\nrival it in real utility; and if not in Germany, where else? It is not\r\nrich in manuscripts, and many libraries surpass it in typographical\r\nrarities, but none contains so great a number of really useful books in\r\nalmost every branch of human knowledge. This library is mainly indebted\r\nfor the preeminence it has obtained to the labors and exertions of the\r\nillustrious Heyne. In the year in which he came to Gottingen as second\r\nlibrarian, the entire control of the library was committed to him, and\r\nhe became chief. From this moment commenced at once its extension and\r\nits improvement. When Heyne went to Gottingen, it already possessed a\r\nlibrary of from 50,000 to 60,000 volumes; at his decease it had\r\nincreased, according to the most moderate computation, to upwards of\r\n200,000 volumes. Nor was this all. At the commencement of his\r\nlibrarianship entire departments of learning were wholly wanting; at its\r\nclose, not only were these deficiencies supplied, but the library had\r\nbecome proportionally rich in every department, and, in point of\r\ncompleteness, unrivalled. Fortunately, Heyne's place has been filled by\r\nworthy successors, and the reputation of the collection is still as\r\ngreat as ever.\r\n\r\n13. _Royal Library, Dresden._--The king of Saxony's library at Dresden\r\ncontains 300,000 volumes of printed books, and 2800 volumes of\r\nmanuscripts. The valuable library that formerly belonged to Count Beurau\r\nforms part of this noble collection, which is most complete in general\r\nhistory, and in Greek and Latin classic authors. Amongst the printed\r\nbooks are some of the rarest specimens of early typography, including\r\n600 of the Aldine editions, and many on vellum, besides a copy of the\r\nfirst edition of the \"Orlando Furioso,\" printed by Mazocco, \"coll'\r\nassistenza dell'autore,\" in 1516, and other rarities. In the department\r\nof manuscripts are a Mexican manuscript, written on human skin,\r\ncontaining, according to Thevenot, a calendar, with some fragments of\r\nthe history of the Incas; the original manuscript of the \"Reveries\" of\r\nMarshal Saxe, bearing at the end that he had composed this work in\r\nthirteen nights during a fever, and completed it in December 1733; a\r\nfine copy of the Koran, taken from a Turk by a Saxon officer at the last\r\nsiege of Vienna, and said to have formerly belonged to Bajazet II.; and\r\na Greek manuscript of the Epistles of St. Paul of the eleventh century.\r\nAn extensive collection of antiquities is preserved in twelve apartments\r\nunder the library, below which are eighteen vaulted cellars, stored with\r\na vast quantity of valuable porcelain, partly of foreign and partly of\r\nDresden manufacture.\r\n\r\n14. _Royal Library, Berlin._--This collection includes works upon almost\r\nall the sciences, and in nearly all languages. Among the manuscripts are\r\nseveral Egyptian deeds, written on papyrus, in the demotic or enchorial\r\ncharacter. These are very curious, and _fac similes_ of some of them\r\nhave been published by Professor Kosegarten in his valuable work on the\r\n\"Ancient Literature of the Egyptians.\"\r\n\r\n15. _University Library, Leyden._--This library was founded by William\r\nI., Prince of Orange, and is justly celebrated throughout Europe for the\r\nmany valuable specimens of Greek and Oriental literature with which it\r\nabounds. To it Joseph Scaliger bequeathed his fine collection of Hebrew\r\nbooks; and it was further enriched by the learned Golius, on his return\r\nfrom the East, with many Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Chaldaic\r\nmanuscripts. In addition to these it received the collections of\r\nHolmanns, and particularly those of Isaac Vossius and Ruhuken--the\r\nformer containing a number of valuable manuscripts, supposed to have\r\nonce belonged to Christina, queen of Sweden; and the latter an almost\r\nentire series of classical authors, with a collection of manuscripts,\r\nperhaps unique, amongst which are copies of several that were consumed\r\nby fire in the Abbey of St. Germain-des-Pres.\r\n\r\n16. _Imperial Library, St. Petersburg._--Russia is indebted for this\r\nsplendid collection to an act of robbery and spoliation. In 1795, when\r\nRussia triumphed over the independence of Poland, the victorious\r\ngeneral, Suwaroff, unceremoniously seized the Zaluski Library, of nearly\r\n300,000 volumes, had it packed up in all haste and dispatched to St.\r\nPetersburg. There it formed the basis of the present Imperial Library,\r\nwhich, but for that stolen collection, instead of now ranking in the\r\nfirst class of European libraries, would scarcely have been entitled to\r\na place in the third.\r\n\r\n17. _Libraries of Constantinople._--This city possesses thirty-two\r\npublic libraries, all varying in extent, but more or less celebrated for\r\nthe number and value of their manuscripts, which are neatly bound in\r\nred, green, or black morocco. The Mohammedans have a peculiar method of\r\nindorsing, placing, and preserving their books. Each volume, besides\r\nbeing bound in morocco, is preserved from dust in a case of the same\r\nmaterial; and on it, as well as on the edges of the leaves, the title is\r\nwritten in large and legible characters. The books are placed, one upon\r\nanother, in presses ornamented with trellis-work, and are disposed along\r\nthe wall, or in the four corners of the library. All these collections\r\nare open to the public throughout the year, excepting on Tuesdays and\r\nFridays: the librarians are as polite and attentive as Turks can be to\r\nthose whom curiosity or love of study attract thither: and every one is\r\nat liberty not merely to peruse, but to make extracts from the books,\r\nand even to transcribe them entirely, provided this be done within the\r\nwalls of the library. Theology, including the Koran and commentators\r\nthereon, jurisprudence, medicine, ethics, and history, are the sciences\r\nchiefly cultivated by the Osmanlis. The books are all written with the\r\ngreatest care on the finest vellum, the text of each page is inclosed in\r\na highly-ornamented and gilt framework, the beginning of each chapter or\r\nsection is splendidly illuminated, and the value of the manuscripts\r\nvaries in proportion to the beauty of the characters.\r\n\r\nWe here terminate our rapid survey of the principal libraries of Europe.\r\nSmall, however, would be the interest which one should feel for these\r\nmagnificent establishments were they designed solely for the benefit of\r\na few individuals, or of any favored class. They would still be splendid\r\nmonuments of the productive powers of the human mind, and of the taste\r\nor learning of their founders; but they would have no claims to that\r\nunbounded admiration with which we now regard them. There is a\r\nrepublican liberality in the management of the great libraries of the\r\ncontinent of Europe which is well worthy of our imitation. In these\r\nalone is the great invention of printing carried out to its full extent,\r\nby the free communication of all its productions to every class of\r\nsociety. No introduction, no recommendation, no securities are required;\r\nbut the stranger and the native are admitted, upon equal terms, to the\r\nfull enjoyment of all the advantages which the uncontrolled use of books\r\ncan afford. As this mode of accommodating, or rather of meeting the\r\nwants of the public, is the real object of these institutions, they are\r\nprovided with librarians, who, under different titles corresponding to\r\nthe duties imposed upon them, receive from government regular salaries\r\nproportioned to their rank and to the services which they perform. To\r\nthese the immediate superintendence of the library is wholly intrusted,\r\nand at a stated hour of every day in the week, except of such as are set\r\napart for public or religious festivals, they open the library to the\r\npublic. There, undisturbed, and supplied with every thing the collection\r\ncontains that can aid him in his studies, the scholar may pass several\r\nhours of every day without any expense, and with no other care than that\r\nnatural attention to the books he uses, which every one capable of\r\nappreciating the full value of such privileges will readily give. Nor do\r\nhis facilities cease here. The time during which the libraries remain\r\nopen may be insufficient for profound and extensive researches, and the\r\nwriter who has to trace his facts through a great variety of works, and\r\nto examine the unpublished documents to be found in public libraries\r\nalone, would be obliged to sacrifice a large portion of every day if his\r\nstudies were regulated by the usual hours of these institutions. For\r\nsuch persons, a proper recommendation can hardly fail to procure the\r\nuse, at their own houses, of the works they may need. In this manner the\r\ndoor is thrown open to every one who wishes to enter, and science placed\r\nwithin reach of all who court her favors.\r\n\r\nThis is as it should be; and it is therefore with great pleasure that we\r\nhave observed symptoms of improvement in this respect originating in our\r\nlegislature. In March, 1849, a select committee was appointed by the\r\nHouse of Commons, on the motion of Mr. William Ewart, to report on the\r\nbest means of \"extending the establishment of libraries freely open to\r\nthe public, especially in large towns, in Great Britain and Ireland.\"\r\nThis committee consisted of fifteen members--namely, Mr. Ewart, Viscount\r\nEbrington, Mr. D'Israeli, Sir Harry Verney, Mr. Charteris, Mr. Bunbury,\r\nMr. G. A. Hamilton, Mr. Brotherton, Mr. Monckton Milnes, the Lord\r\nAdvocate (Mr. Rutherford), Mr. Thicknesse, Sir John Walsh, Mr.\r\nMackinnon, Mr. Kershaw, and Mr. Wyld. These gentlemen seem to have\r\nentered upon their labors with zeal, and to have performed their duty\r\nwith thoroughness and fidelity. They held numerous sessions, and\r\nexamined a large number of witnesses. The particulars of these\r\nexaminations have been printed in full, and form a rather bulky\r\nblue-book, in which the report of the committee occupies only twelve\r\npages, while the minutes of evidence, tables, &c., fill over three\r\nhundred. The committee appear to have felt that it was only necessary to\r\nlay before parliament and the public the facts concerning the present\r\ncondition and wants of the public libraries of this country, in order to\r\ninsure the supply of all deficiencies.\r\n\r\nAfter presenting a brief view of the principal libraries in the various\r\ncountries of Europe, with a more particular account of the present\r\ncondition of those in Great Britain, showing that the English are far\r\nbehind their continental brethren in this respect, the committee thus\r\nexpress their conviction--\"Whatever may be our disappointment at the\r\nrarity of public libraries in the United Kingdom, we feel satisfaction\r\nin stating that the uniform current of the evidence tends to prove the\r\nincreased qualifications of the people to appreciate and enjoy such\r\ninstitutions. Testimony, showing a great improvement in the national\r\nhabits and manners, is abundantly given in the evidence taken by the\r\ncommittee. That they would be still further improved by the\r\nestablishment of public libraries, it needs not even the high authority\r\nand ample evidence of the witnesses who appeared before the committee to\r\ndemonstrate.\"\r\n\r\nFrequent and favorable allusions are made in the report and the minutes\r\nof evidence to the numerous popular libraries in this country for\r\ndistrict schools, factories, &c. These, we are aware, are of the\r\ngreatest value; but these alone are not sufficient. The establishment of\r\neven a hundred thousand small village or district-school libraries would\r\nnot supersede the necessity of a certain number of large and\r\ncomprehensive ones. These little collections are much alike, each\r\ncontaining nearly the same books as every other. The committee of\r\nparliament appear to understand this. \"It is evident,\" they say, \"that\r\nthere should be in all countries libraries of two sorts; libraries of\r\ndeposit and research, and libraries devoted to the general reading and\r\ncirculation of books. Libraries of deposit should contain, if possible,\r\nalmost every book that ever has existed. The most insignificant tract,\r\nthe most trifling essay, a sermon, a newspaper, or a song, may afford an\r\nillustration of manners or opinions elucidatory of the past, and throw a\r\nfaithful though feeble light on the pathway of the future historian. In\r\nsuch libraries nothing should be rejected. Not but that libraries of\r\ndeposit and of general reading may (as in the case of the British\r\nMuseum) be combined. But though such combination is possible, and may be\r\ndesirable, the distinction which we have drawn should never be\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\nThe first, and apparently, in the estimation of the committee, the most\r\nimportant witness, was Edward Edwards, Esq., an assistant in the\r\ndepartment of printed books in the British Museum. The minutes of his\r\nevidence alone cover between sixty and seventy of the closely-printed\r\nfolio pages accompanying the report; and besides this, he has furnished\r\nvarious statistical tables, occupying fifty pages, and a series of\r\ntwelve maps. In one of these maps it is his purpose to exhibit, by\r\nvarious shades, the relative provision of books in public libraries in\r\nthe principal states of Europe, as compared with their respective\r\npopulations; and in the others, the local situation of the public\r\nlibraries in some of the principal cities is indicated. The evidence of\r\nMr. Edwards has been severely commented upon in the London papers and\r\nelsewhere, and some inaccuracies in his tables, of greater or less\r\nmagnitude, have been pointed out. We might, perhaps, by a particular\r\nexamination of every word and figure, add something to the list of\r\nerrata. But we think that those persons who are most familiar with the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining exact statistical details, will not wonder that\r\nan error should here and there be found. We have looked over the\r\nevidence and the tables with considerable care, and think them, on the\r\nwhole, highly creditable to the author. It is evident, however, from the\r\ngeneral tenor of his testimony, that Mr. Edwards presses rather too\r\nstrongly the point respecting the condition of England, compared with\r\nthat of the countries on the continent, as to the number and\r\naccessibility of their public libraries. His enthusiasm on the subject,\r\narising probably from a laudable desire to have his own country take a\r\nhigher rank in respect to libraries than she now holds, has led him, we\r\nthink, to overlook or undervalue some of the advantages which she\r\nalready possesses. But his facts and figures are in the main to be\r\nrelied upon; and we shall make use of them as sufficiently accurate to\r\ngive our readers a general view of the present bibliothecal condition of\r\nthe principal countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Edwards's map of Europe we find the smaller German states to be\r\nrepresented with the lightest lines, indicating the highest rank, and\r\nGreat Britain with the darkest or lowest. He states the provision of\r\nbooks in libraries publicly accessible, as compared with the population,\r\nto be as follows:--In Saxony, for every 100 inhabitants there are 417\r\nbooks; in Denmark, 412; in Bavaria, 339; in Tuscany, 261; in Prussia,\r\n200; in Austria, 167; in France, 129; in Belgium, 95; whilst in Great\r\nBritain there are only 53 to every 100 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn the following tables, the libraries containing fewer than 10,000\r\nvolumes each (of which there are, in France alone, at least seventy or\r\neighty) are not taken into the account:--\r\n\r\nFrance       has 107 public libraries, containing 4,000,000 vols.\r\nPrussia       \"   44       \"                \"     2,400,000  \"\r\nAustria       \"   48       \"                \"     2,400,000  \"\r\nGreat Britain \"   33       \"                \"     1,771,000  \"\r\nBavaria       \"   17       \"                \"     1,267,000  \"\r\nDenmark       \"    5       \"                \"       645,000  \"\r\nSaxony        \"    6       \"                \"       554,000  \"\r\nBelgium       \"   14       \"                \"       538,000  \"\r\nTuscany       \"    9       \"                \"       411,000  \"\r\n\r\nTaking the capital cities, we find the following results:--\r\n\r\nParis        has   9 public libraries, containing 1,474,000 vols.\r\nMunich        \"    2       \"                \"       800,000  \"\r\nCopenhagen    \"    3       \"                \"       557,000  \"\r\nBerlin        \"    2       \"                \"       530,000  \"\r\nLondon        \"    4       \"                \"       490,500  \"\r\nVienna        \"    3       \"                \"       453,000  \"\r\nDresden       \"    4       \"                \"       340,500  \"\r\nFlorence      \"    6       \"                \"       318,000  \"\r\nMilan         \"    2       \"                \"       230,000  \"\r\nBrussels      \"    2       \"                \"       143,500  \"\r\n\r\nArranging these libraries according to their extent, or number of\r\nprinted books, they would stand as follows:--\r\n\r\n                              Printed Books.

The aggregate number of volumes in\r\nthese collections is about 980,413. We subjoin the contents of a few of\r\nthe largest:--\r\n\r\nHarvard College Library,            72,000 vols.\r\nPhiladelphia and Loganian Library,  60,000  \"\r\nBoston Athenaeum,                    50,000  \"\r\nLibrary of Congress,                50,000  \"\r\nNew York Society Library,           32,000  \"\r\nMercantile Library, New-York,       32,000  \"\r\nGeorgetown College,                 25,000  \"\r\nBrown University,                   24,000  \"\r\nNew-York State Library,             24,000  \"\r\nYale College,                       21,000  \"\r\n\r\nAmerica will, however, soon possess a library worthy of its character as\r\na great nation. The Astor Library, now in the course of formation, owes\r\nits existence to the munificence of John Jacob Astor, who died on the\r\n29th of March, 1848, leaving by his will the sum of 400,000 dollars for\r\nthe establishment of a public library in the city of New-York.\r\nSeventy-five thousand dollars were to be appropriated to the erection of\r\na suitable building, and 120,000 dollars to the purchase of books as a\r\nnucleus. The smallest number of books which the trustees consider it\r\nsafe to estimate as a basis for enlargement is 100,000 volumes. The\r\nAstor Library will probably, when first formed, contain a larger number\r\nand a better selection of books than any other in the United States.\r\nWith the generous provision which the founder has made for its increase,\r\ntogether with the liberal donations which will undoubtedly be made to\r\nthis as the chief library in the country, it is likely to grow rapidly,\r\ntill it will take rank with the large libraries of the old world. Under\r\nthe direction of an enlightened and judicious Board of Trustees, with\r\nWashington Irving for president, and Dr. Cogswell for superintendent of\r\nthe institution, there is every reason to believe that the desire so\r\nwarmly expressed at the conclusion of their report will be fulfilled:\r\n\"That the Astor Library may soon become, as a depository of the\r\ntreasures of literature and science, what the city possessing it is\r\nrapidly becoming in commerce and wealth.\"\r\n\r\nThe second witness examined by the committee was M. Guizot. In the\r\ndistinguished positions which he has filled as minister of public\r\ninstruction and prime minister in France, his attention has been turned\r\nto the public libraries of that country. While in office he ordered an\r\ninspection of those institutions, and the French government now has\r\ncomplete and exact documents relative to the number of public libraries,\r\nand the number of books in each. These institutions are accessible to\r\nthe public in every way for reading, and to a great extent for borrowing\r\nbooks. Some of them receive direct grants from the government towards\r\ntheir support; while others, in the provincial towns, are supported by\r\nmunicipal funds; and to the latter the government distributes copies of\r\ncostly works, for the publication of which it in general subscribes\r\nliberally. M. Guizot attributes the happiest results to this system. He\r\nsays--\"There are two good results: the first is, a general regard in the\r\nmind of the public for learning, for literature, and for books. That\r\ncomplete accessibility to the libraries gives to every one, learned or\r\nunlearned, a general feeling of good-will for learning and for\r\nknowledge; and then the second result is, that the means for acquiring\r\nknowledge are given to those persons who are able to employ them.\"\r\n\r\nHis Excellency M. Van de Weyer, the Belgian ambassador, was next\r\nexamined. He testified that the public libraries in his own country were\r\nnumerous, large, and easily accessible to all who desire to make use of\r\nthem. He attributes the best results to the literary character of his\r\ncountry from this privilege of free access to their large collections of\r\nbooks. He thinks the people are better prepared than is generally\r\nsupposed to appreciate works of a high character. He seems to think it\r\nunwise to attempt to popularize science and literature by printing\r\ninferior books, written expressly for common and uneducated people. The\r\ngovernment subscribe for a number of copies of nearly every valuable\r\nwork published, by which means they encourage the progress of\r\nliterature, and are enabled to enrich many of the public collections.\r\n\"The government have sometimes, within a space of twenty years, spent\r\nsome L10,000 or L12,000 in favor of libraries. I take this opportunity\r\nof stating also, that though the Chamber only votes a grant of 65,000 or\r\n70,000 francs for the Royal Public Library of Brussels, whenever there\r\nis some large sale going on, there is always a special grant made to the\r\nlibrary. Lately one of the most curious private libraries had been\r\nadvertised for sale; a catalogue had been printed in six volumes; the\r\ngovernment immediately came forward, bought the whole of the collection\r\nfor L13,000 or L14,000, and made it an addition to the Royal Library in\r\nBrussels; they did the same thing at Ghent; I believe that the library\r\nthat they bought at Ghent consisted of about 20,000 volumes, and in\r\nBrussels about 60,000 or 70,000 volumes.\" Our own government would do\r\nwell to imitate this example more frequently than it has hitherto done.\r\n\r\nPassing by several witnesses whose evidence we should be glad to notice\r\ndid our limits permit, we come to George Dawson, Esquire, who as a\r\nlecturer, has had opportunities of becoming acquainted with the\r\ncondition, the feelings and the wants of the working-classes in the\r\nmanufacturing towns both in England and Scotland. He testifies that\r\nlibraries to some extent have already been formed in those places, and\r\nthat there is a very general desire among the working-people to avail\r\nthemselves of more and better books. They can appreciate the best\r\nauthors. Political and historical subjects interest them most, but the\r\nhigher class of poetry is also read by them. Milton is much read. Mr.\r\nDawson says, \"Shakspeare is known by heart almost. I could produce men\r\nwho could be cross-examined upon any play.\" The contrast between the\r\nmanufacturing and the farming districts in respect to the intelligence\r\nof the people and their desire for improvement is very great. Speaking\r\nof one of the agricultural districts, Mr. Dawson says, \"I have heard of\r\na parish in Norfolk where a woman was the parish clerk, because there\r\nwas not a man in the parish who could read or write!\"\r\n\r\nHenry Stevens, Esq., formerly librarian of one of the libraries\r\nconnected with Yale College, gave some valuable information respecting\r\nthe present state of public libraries in the United States. He says:\r\n\"The public libraries of the United States are small but very numerous.\r\nWe have but two containing above 50,000 volumes, while there are nine\r\nabove 20,000, forty-three above 10,000, more than a hundred above 5000\r\nvolumes, and thousands of smaller ones. The want of large public\r\nconsulting libraries, like those of Europe, is much felt.\" The chief\r\nreaders in these libraries are the working-classes, and persons who are\r\nengaged in active business through the day. Works on physical science,\r\nhistory, biography, and of a superior class, are those chiefly read by\r\nthem; and Mr. Stevens stated, that when he came to England, he could not\r\nhelp being struck by the \"little reading that there is among the\r\nlaboring and business classes\" of this country as compared with the\r\nUnited States. This is succinctly explained by Mr. Dawson, who says:\r\n\"The quantity of people who cannot read and write in this country is a\r\nvery great hinderance to the demand for books. We have _eight millions_\r\nwho cannot write yet!\" Mr. Edwards, in his evidence, also points to the\r\nsame deficiency of elementary education, \"In addition,\" he says, \"to the\r\npositive want of schooling on the part of large numbers of the\r\npopulation who are now growing up, those who do get some partial\r\neducation, habitually neglect to improve what they get from the want of\r\ncultivating a taste for reading. Unless good books are made accessible\r\nto the people, this is very likely to continue to be a cause--even where\r\neducation by Sunday schools, and other efforts of that kind, have been\r\nbrought within the reach of a considerable number of the population--why\r\nthe good effects of education have not been continued in after life.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee very justly place much value on the opinions and\r\nsuggestions of M. Libri. The thorough knowledge which that eminent\r\nbibliographer possesses of all matters pertaining to the condition and\r\nwants of public libraries, as well as of the needs of literary men,\r\nrenders his remarks worthy of careful consideration. In a letter\r\naddressed to Mr. Ewart, the chairman of the committee, he develops his\r\nviews at some length, and shows the necessity of having in great\r\ncountries libraries \"in which one may expect to find, as far as it is\r\npossible, all books which learned men--men who occupy themselves upon\r\nany subject whatever, and who cultivate one of the branches of human\r\nknowledge--may require to consult. Of these there is nothing useless,\r\nnothing ought to be neglected; the most insignificant in appearance,\r\nthose which on their publication have attracted the least attention,\r\nsometimes become the source of valuable and unexpected information.\" It\r\nis in the fragments, now so rare and precious, of some alphabets--of\r\nsome small grammars published for the use of schools about the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century--or in the letters distributed in Germany by the\r\nreligious bodies commissioned to collect alms, that bibliographers now\r\nseek to discover the first processes employed by the inventors of\r\nxylography and typography. It is in a forgotten collection of\r\nindifferent plates, published at Venice by Faush Verantio towards the\r\nend of the sixteenth century, that an engineer, who interests himself in\r\nthe history of the mechanical arts, might find the first diagrams of\r\niron suspension-bridges.\r\n\r\nNothing should be neglected; nothing is useless to whoever wishes\r\nthoroughly to study a subject. An astronomer, who desires to study the\r\nmotions peculiar to certain stars, requires to consult all the old books\r\nof astronomy, and even of astrology, which appear the most replete with\r\nerror. A chemist, a man who is engaged in the industrial arts, may still\r\nconsult with profit certain works on alchemy, and even on magic. A\r\nlegislator, a jurisconsult, needs sometimes to be acquainted with the\r\nlaws, the ordinances, which derive their origin from the most barbarous\r\nages; but it is particularly for the biographer, for the historian, that\r\nit is necessary to prepare the largest field of inquiry, to amass the\r\ngreatest quantity of materials. This is not only true as regards past\r\ntimes, but we ought to prepare the materials for future students.\r\nHistorical facts which appear the least important, the most\r\ninsignificant anecdotes, registered in a pamphlet, mentioned in a\r\nplacard or in a song, nay be connected at a later period in an\r\nunforeseen manner with events which acquire great importance, or with\r\nmen who are distinguished in history by their genius, by their sudden\r\nelevation, or even by their crimes. We are not born celebrated--men\r\nbecome so; and when we desire to trace the history of those who have\r\nattained it, the inquirer is often obliged to pursue his researches in\r\ntheir most humble beginnings. Who would have imagined that the obscure\r\nauthor of a small pamphlet, \"Le Souper de Beaucaire,\" would subsequently\r\nbecome the Emperor Napoleon? and that to write fully the life of the\r\nexecrable Marat, one ought to have the very insignificant essays on\r\nphysics that he published before the Revolution? Nothing is too\r\nunimportant for whoever wishes thoroughly to study the literary or\r\nscientific history of a country, or for one who undertakes to trace the\r\nintellectual progress of eminent minds, or to inform himself in detail\r\nof the changes which have taken place in the institutions and in the\r\nmanners of a nation. Without speaking of the commentaries or\r\nconsiderable additions which have been introduced in the various\r\nreprints of an author, the successive editions of the same work which\r\nappear to resemble each other the most, are often distinguished from\r\neach other by peculiarities worthy of much attention. It has been well\r\nsaid, that a public library should contain all those works which are too\r\ncostly, too voluminous, or of _too little value_ in the common\r\nestimation to be found elsewhere, down even to the smallest tracts. An\r\nold almanac, or a forgotten street-ballad, has sometimes enabled the\r\nhistorian to verify or correct some important point which would\r\notherwise have remained in dispute.\r\n\r\nWith a brief extract from the evidence of one other witness we must\r\nclose our notice of the Report on Public Libraries. Charles Meyer, Esq.,\r\nGerman secretary to his Royal Highness Prince Albert, had given\r\nattention to the public libraries of Germany, having resided several\r\nyears in Gotha, Hamburg, Leipsic, and Munich. He had perused the\r\nprincipal part of the evidence which had been given by Mr. Edwards upon\r\nthis subject, and found all that he stated to be quite correct. Dr.\r\nMeyer thinks the existence of the numerous and valuable libraries of\r\nGermany has given the literary men of that country an advantage over\r\nthe literary men of England. \"It has saved a great number of our\r\nGerman learned men,\" he says, \"from the danger of becoming\r\n_autodidactoi_--self-taught. I think that is one essential point of\r\ndifference that is visible in comparing the general character of the\r\ninstruction in this country with that on the continent: there are in\r\nthis country a great number of self-taught people, who think according\r\nto their own views, without any reference to previous scientific works.\r\nThey make sometimes very great discoveries; but sometimes they find that\r\nthey have wasted their labor upon subjects already known, which have\r\nbeen written upon by a great number of people before them; but as they\r\nhave no access to libraries, it is impossible for them to get acquainted\r\nwith the literature of that branch upon which they treat.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding quotations, it is evident that, in the opinion of the\r\nParliamentary Committee, and of the witnesses examined by it, there\r\nexists in this country at once a great deficiency of public libraries\r\nand a pressing necessity for their establishment. Our people are and\r\nwill be readers. They are generally prepared to make a good use of books\r\nof a higher order than those offered to them in so cheap and attractive\r\na form by our enterprising publishers. Now, either their energies will\r\nbe wasted in a desultory course of reading, by which they will gain only\r\na superficial knowledge of almost every conceivable subject, or they\r\nmust be furnished with the means, which they are so well prepared to use\r\nto advantage, of going to the bottom of whatever subject interests them,\r\nand having exhausted the wisdom of past generations, of adding to the\r\nstock of general knowledge from the results of their own thoughts and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for the establishment of large collections of books,\r\nfreely open to the public--of institutions in which, as Ovid well\r\nexpresses it,\r\n\r\n    \"Quaeque viri docto veteres cepere novique\r\n    Pectore, lecturis inspicienda patent\"--\r\n\r\nis, we imagine, unquestioned and unquestionable. The question now\r\narises, How are these libraries to be constituted? On this point it will\r\nnot be expected that we should dilate at length. At the present time the\r\nbest books on all subjects are to be purchased at a moderate rate; and\r\nin the formation of new libraries, attention should first be paid to the\r\nsupply of works most generally in demand. It will neither be wise nor\r\njust to the public to purchase, at the outset, rare and curious works:\r\nwhen a sufficient supply of really useful and generally read\r\npublications has been obtained, it will be quite time enough to think of\r\nindulging the bibliomania. But there is one subject on which this taste\r\nmay advantageously be indulged--and that is, every town in which a\r\npublic library is established should take care to collect all works\r\nrelating to its local or municipal history. A selection of the best\r\nbooks on bibliography should also be possessed by each. These are to the\r\nlibrarian and the literary man what the compass is to the mariner, or\r\nthe tools of his trade to the artisan.\r\n\r\nBut we must hasten to a conclusion. As a pendent to the Report of the\r\nParliamentary Committee, Mr. Ewart brought forward a bill for the\r\nestablishment of libraries and museums in country towns. This bill has\r\nnow received the sanction of the legislature; its operation is, however,\r\nlimited to boroughs whose population exceeds 10,000; and before it can\r\nbe carried into effect, a public meeting of rate-payers must be called,\r\nand the consent of two-thirds of those present obtained. Liverpool was\r\nthe first to profit by this act: other towns have followed her example;\r\nand we trust that ere long, in all the considerable towns throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of this land, public libraries and museums will be\r\nestablished. The subject is one that cannot be long neglected. It will\r\ngo on gaining upon public attention, until seen by all in its true\r\nlight, and in all its bearings. Then the connection between a sound\r\nliterature and the means used for its formation will be felt; then the\r\nnumerous and immediate advantages of such a form of encouragement, as\r\nthe establishment of these institutions, will be clearly seen and fully\r\nunderstood; and the rich harvest of glory which our future scholars will\r\nreap in every branch of study must convince even the most incredulous,\r\nthat literature asks no favors and seeks no aid for which she does not\r\nrepay the giver with a tenfold increase.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] The library of Pergamos was founded by King Eumenes, and enlarged\r\nby his successor Attalus. It soon became so extensive that the\r\nPtolemies, afraid that it would speedily rival their own collection at\r\nAlexandria, issued an edict forbidding the exportation of papyrus; but\r\nthis prohibition, so far from attaining the unworthy object for which it\r\nwas destined, proved rather beneficial; for the Pergameans, having\r\nexhausted their stock of papyrus, set their wits to work, and invented\r\nparchment (_charta Pergamena_) as a substitute.\r\n\r\n[20] One of the most remarkable of these purchases was that made of the\r\nprivate library of the Prince Eugene, for a life-income of 10,000\r\nflorins. It was composed of 15,000 printed volumes, 337 manuscripts, 290\r\nfolio volumes of prints, and 215 portfolios or boxes.\r\n\r\n[21] For a detailed account of, and guide-book to, the treasures of this\r\ngreat national collection, see \"The British Museum, Historical and\r\nDescriptive, with Numerous Engravings,\" recently published by W. & R.\r\nChambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNALS OF LOUIS PHILIPPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur readers know that one of the points of the singular but admirable\r\neducation that Madame de Genlis gave Louis Philippe and his brothers,\r\nwas to teach them to examine and regulate their mind and conduct by the\r\nkeeping of a journal; and this Louis Philippe has done, not, we suppose,\r\ncontinuously, nor even, perhaps, for the greater part of his busy life,\r\nbut for particular periods--during seasons either of peculiar interest\r\nor of unusual leisure. A fragment of his early journal, extending from\r\nthe autumn of 1790 to the summer of 1791, was lost or stolen in the\r\ntumults and pillage of the first Revolution, as the memoirs of 1815 have\r\nbeen in the late one, and like these, published by an illegitimate\r\npossessor. That most curious little tract had become very rare--so rare,\r\nindeed, that Louis Philippe himself had not a copy, till a friend of\r\nours lately presented him the copy from which we ourselves had made a\r\ntranslation, which we published _in extenso_ in our article on \"The\r\nPersonal History of Louis Philippe.\" The King had also written and\r\nprinted the \"Journal of the Hundred Days,\" just mentioned; and we were\r\npermitted to see and make extracts in our last March number from his\r\nJournal of February and March, 1848. It is known, too, that during his\r\nresidence at Claremont, as at former intervals of repose, he amused\r\nhimself in recording his recollections; but no information has yet\r\ntranspired of the extent (either as to bulk or time) of what he may have\r\nleft--beyond the conjecture (which is, however, only founded on an\r\naccidental expression of his which was repeated to us some months ago)\r\nthat the portion which he was so anxious to complete related to his\r\nreturn to France in 1814. * * But whatever Louis Philippe may have left,\r\nit will be curious and valuable, as the production of so powerful a\r\nmind, always engaged in, and for a long period actually directing, the\r\nmost extraordinary series of events in the history of the modern world.\r\nIts publication, however, must be, of course, a matter of great\r\ndelicacy, and of mature deliberation, and we have not as yet heard even\r\na rumor on the subject.\r\n\r\nThese facts are from an interesting paper in the last number of the\r\nQuarterly Review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUNJARAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis most interesting race, the travelling grain merchants of western\r\nIndia (who lead a life wholly nomadic, and have done so earlier than is\r\nrecorded), have their best interests opposed to the introduction of\r\nforeign innovation in the matter of transit. The Bunjaras have no\r\nsympathy with civilized life; from the people of India they move, think,\r\nlive apart, varying in dress, language, religion, from all about them.\r\nRajpoots by origin, they can follow no trade; the Bunjara may _serve_\r\nonly as a soldier; in all other callings he must be free and\r\nindependent. For hundreds of years we find them, as hordes, encamping in\r\nthe open air, and living by the exchange of merchandise. They are owners\r\nof great droves of bullocks, which, laden with grain in the upper\r\ncountry, they drive to the coast, exchanging their burthens for salt, at\r\na favorable market, but sedulously avoiding all intercourse with\r\nstrangers and their cities. The Bunjaras are a stout, sturdy race;\r\nsturdy and stout in action and resolve as they are in body and form,\r\nSpartan-like in their sense of honor, free in their opinion as the\r\nmountain breeze, keeping apart from men and their cabals, and existing\r\nby their own energies. A short time since, I journeyed on horseback over\r\nthe very line of this proposed railway, from the city of Nassiek to\r\nBombay, and encountered several hundreds of bullocks heavily laden, and\r\nattended by Bunjara families; the men armed with sword and matchlock,\r\nthe children propped up among the bullock furniture, and each younger\r\nwoman of the tribe looking much as one fancies the Jewish maiden must\r\nhave looked when she obtained grace and favor in the sight of King\r\nAhasuerus, who \"made her queen instead of Vashti.\" It is worthy of\r\nremark, that the choice of colors among the Bunjara women is altogether\r\nopposed to general taste among the Hindoos. Red and yellow among the\r\nlatter are always favorite tints, and blue is never worn by any but the\r\ncommon people, to whom it is recommended by the cheapness of the indigo\r\nused in dyeing. The Bunjara women, on the contrary, select the richest\r\nimaginable Tyrian purple, a sort of rosy smalt, as the ground of their\r\nattire, which is bordered by a deep phylactery of divers colors in\r\ncurious needlework, wrought in with small mirrors, beads, and sparkling\r\ncrystals. Their saree has a fringe of shells, and their handsome arms\r\nand delicate ankles are laden with rich ornaments The Bunjara women\r\nplaid their hair with crimson silk, and suffer it to fall on either side\r\nof the face, the ends secured with silver tassels, and on the summit of\r\nthe head they wear a small tiara studded with silver stars. The reader\r\nmay think this a fanciful and exaggerated dress for the wife of a\r\ndrover; but these costumes are heir-looms, and though they are often\r\nseen faded, torn, travel-stained, and grim, the materials are always as\r\nI have described them, differing in freshness, but never in\r\ncharacter.--_Sharpe._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Dublin University Magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTIC VIAL:\r\n\r\nOR, THE LAST DEMOISELLE DE CHARREBOURG\r\n\r\n_Concluded from page 264._\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--JONQUIL.\r\n\r\nBlassemare, meanwhile, made his toilet elaborately, and by ten o'clock\r\nwas in Paris. He stopped at the Hotel Secqville.\r\n\r\n\"Is the marquis yet risen?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No;\" he was in his bed; he had not retired until very late, and must\r\nnot be disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"But I _must_ see him, my good friend; his happiness, indeed his safety,\r\ndepends upon my seeing him immediately.\"\r\n\r\nBlassemare was so very urgent, that at length the servant consented to\r\ndeliver a note to his master.\r\n\r\nRubbing his eyes, and more asleep than awake, the marquis took the\r\nbillet, and read--\r\n\r\n\"The Sieur de Blassemare, who had the honor of meeting the Marquis de\r\nSecqville last night at the Chateau des Anges, implores a few minutes\r\nconversation without one moment's delay; by granting which the marquis\r\nmay possibly avert consequences the most deplorable.\"\r\n\r\nCertain shocks are strong enough to restore a drunken man to sobriety in\r\nan instant, and, _a fortiori_, to dispel in a moment the fumes of sleep.\r\nIn a few seconds the marquis, in slippers, and morning-gown, received\r\nBlassemare, with many apologies, in his dressing-room.\r\n\r\n\"A very slight acquaintance will justify a _friendly_ interposition,\"\r\nsaid Blassemare, after a few little speeches of ceremony at each side;\r\n\"and my visit is inspired by a friendly and charitable motive. The fact\r\nis--the fact is--my dear friend, that--your coat is torn.\"\r\n\r\n\"My coat torn!\" repeated the marquis in surprise, visibly disconcerted,\r\nwhile he affected surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the coat you wore last night. Ah! there it is--this blue velvet,\r\nwith diamond button. La! Yes, there is the place. It was caught--ha, ha,\r\nha!--in that cursed door; and, egad, as one of Le Prun's confidential\r\nadvisers has got the piece in his possession----\"\r\n\r\n\"Psha! you are jesting. Why, there are more blue coats than one in the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; but there is only _one_ Marquis de Secqville. And as I\r\nhappened, purely accidentally, upon my honor, to witness with my own\r\neyes no inconsiderable part of his last night's adventure, it may be as\r\nwell if he reverses his clever points of evidence for Monsieur Le Prun,\r\nshould his suspicions chance to take an unfortunate direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"What adventure pray, sir, do you speak of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your interview with Madame Le Prun, your unfortunate descent from the\r\nbalcony, your flight through the park-door, and the disastrous severance\r\nof a button and a specimen-bit of velvet from your coat--in short, my\r\ndear marquis, you may, if you please, affect a reserve, which, indeed,\r\n_I_ should prefer to a frank confession, by which, although I have\r\nnothing to learn, I should, in some sort, be compelled to regard your\r\nsecret as one of honor; as it is, you know, I am free----\"\r\n\r\n\"No gentleman is free to compromise a lady's character by his\r\ninsinuations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor by his _conduct_, my dear marquis. But should he be so unfortunate\r\nas to have done so, he ought, in prudence and generosity, to seal as\r\nmany lips as he possibly can.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems, sir, to me that you have come to me with a cock-and-a-bull\r\nstory, to establish an imaginary connection between me and some stupid\r\nadventure, which occurred at the Chateau des Anges.\"\r\n\r\n\"And such being your belief, my dear marquis, I have, of course, only to\r\nmake my adieux, and relieve you from so impertinent an intrusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, sir. You are a gentleman; there are, perhaps, circumstances of\r\nsuspicion. It is very embarrassing to have a lady's name involved;\r\nand--and--in short, sir, I----\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"_What_, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I throw myself upon your honor!\" said the marquis, with an effort, and\r\nextending his hand.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, my dear marquis,\" said Blassemare, accepting his\r\nproffered hand. \"You know I am Le Prun's friend; and as there was no\r\nobligation of secrecy, till your own confidence imposed it, I should\r\nhave been in a difficult position as respected him. I have now learned\r\nyour secret from yourself--honor seals my lips; and so, having put you\r\nupon your guard, and enjoined the extremest caution, at least for the\r\npresent, I commend you to your presiding planets, Mercury and Venus. But\r\nyou had better burn that tell-tale coat; for here is not a shrewder\r\nfellow in all France than Le Prun, and 'gad you are not safe till it is\r\nin ashes.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Blassemare, be my friend; quiet his suspicions. I shall one day\r\ntell you all; only avert his suspicions from her.\"\r\n\r\n\"By my faith, that is more than I _can_ do. Give me a line to her; _I_\r\nmust direct her conduct, or she will ruin herself. I know Le Prun; it\r\nneeds a skilful player to hide one's cards from him. I am a man of my\r\nword; and I pledge my honor that Le Prun shall not have hint of your\r\nsecret.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Blassemare. _I_ can't see her without exposing her to\r\nrisk; do all you can to protect her from jealousy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, give me my credentials.\"\r\n\r\nSecqville wrote:--\"_Blassemare is the friend of Dubois; Lucille may\r\ntrust him._\"\r\n\r\n\"She knew me first by that name; be careful not to risk losing the\r\npaper.\"\r\n\r\nAgain they bid farewell, and Blassemare departed.\r\n\r\nBlassemare's head was as full of strange images as the steam of a\r\nwitch's caldron. He had his own notions of honor--somewhat fantastic and\r\ninconsistent, but still strong enough to prevent his betraying to Le\r\nPrun the secret of which he had just made himself completely master. He\r\nwas mortified intensely by the discovery of a successful rival where he\r\nhad so coolly and confidently flattered himself with a solitary\r\nconquest. He looked upon himself as the _dupe_ of a young girl and her\r\nmelancholy lover. His vanity, his spleen, and his guilty fancy, which,\r\nwith the discovery of his difficulties, expanded almost into a passion,\r\nall stimulated him to continue the pursuit, and his brain teemed with\r\nschemes for outwitting them both, supplanting his rival, and gaining his\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nFull of these, he reached the Chateau des Anges--a sage, trustworthy,\r\nand virtuous counsellor for old Le Prun to lean on in his difficulties!\r\n\r\n\"You did wrong, in my opinion, to unmask your suspicions to old\r\nCharrebourg,\" said Blassemare, after he and Le Prun had talked over the\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n\"But he has not seen my wife since, and she, therefore, knows nothing of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I in your place, notwithstanding, I should see him again, undo the\r\neffect of what I had said, and so prevent his putting Madame Le Prun on\r\nher guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right for once. I thought of doing so myself.\"\r\n\r\nLe Prun generally acted promptly; and so he left Blassemare to his\r\nmeditations. Framing his little speech of apology as he went along, he\r\ntraversed several passages, descended a stair in one of the towers, and\r\nfound himself at last at the lobby of the Visconte's suite of rooms. It\r\nwas now night--and these apartments lying in the oldest part of the\r\nchateau, and little frequented, were but very dimly lighted. There was\r\nnobody waiting in the anteroom--the servant had probably taken advantage\r\nof his master's repose, or reverie, to steal away to the gay society of\r\nhis brother domestics; and these sombre and magnificently constructed\r\nrooms were as deserted as they were dim.\r\n\r\nHaving called in vain, the Fermier-General lighted a candle at the murky\r\nlamp, and entered the Visconte's apartment. His step was arrested by a\r\nhowling from the inner chambers that might have spoken the despair of an\r\nevil spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Charrebourg! Visconte! Charrebourg!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer--There was a silence--then another swelling howl.\r\n\r\n\"Psha!--it is that cursed old cur. I had forgotten him. Jonquil,\r\nJonquil! come here, boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe old dog came scrambling along, and looking up into Le Prun's face,\r\nyelped strangely.\r\n\r\n\"What!--hungry? They have forgotten you, I dare say. What! not a scrap,\r\nnot a bone! But where is your master?\"\r\n\r\nLe Prun entered the inner room, and the dog, preceding him, ran behind\r\nthe fauteuil that stood at the table; and then running a step or two\r\ntowards Le Prun, raised a howl that made him jump.\r\n\r\n\"Hey! what's the matter? But, sacre! there _is_ something--what is\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a candle burning on the table, and writing materials. The\r\nVisconte de Charrebourg, who had evidently been writing, had fallen\r\nforward upon the table--dead. Le Prun touched him, he was quite cold. He\r\nraised the tall lank figure as well as he could, so that it leaned back\r\nin the chair; a little blood came from the corner of the mouth, the eyes\r\nwere glazed, but the features wore, even in death, a character of\r\nsternness and dignity. He had fallen forward upon the fingers that held\r\nthe pen, and the hand came stiffly back along with the body, still\r\nholding the pen in the attitude in which the chill of death had\r\nstiffened them. In this attitude he looked as if he only awaited a\r\nphrase or a thought of which he was in search to resume his writing.\r\n\r\n\"Dead--dead--a long time dead! how the devil has all this happened?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he looked for a moment at the old hound that was sniffing and\r\nwhimpering in his master's ears, as if he could answer him. Poor\r\nJonquil! he has shared his master's fortune fairly--the better and the\r\nworse; for years his humble comrade in the sylvan solitudes of\r\nCharrebourg, and here the solitary witness of his parting moment. Who\r\ncan say with what more than human grief that dumb heart is swelling! He\r\nwill not outlive his old friend many days--Jonquil is past the age for\r\nmaking new ones.\r\n\r\nLe Prun glanced at the letter, a few lines of which the dead man had\r\ntraced when he was thus awfully interrupted. \"Sir,\" it began, \"the\r\nfamily of Charrebourg, of which I am the unworthy representative, have\r\nbeen remarkable at all times for a chivalric and honorable spirit. They\r\nhave maintained their dignity in prosperity by great deeds and princely\r\nmunificence--in adversity, by encountering grief with patience, and\r\ninsolence with defiance. Insult has never approached them unexpiated by\r\nblood; and I, old as I am, in consequence of what this morning----\" here\r\nthe summons had interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Intended for me!\" said Le Prun, with an ugly sneer. \"Well, he can't now\r\nput his daughter on her guard, or inflame her with the magnificent\r\nspirit of the beggarly Charrebourgs.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he surrendered the chamber to the dead Visconte and his\r\ncanine watcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--ISOLATION.\r\n\r\nBlassemare kept his counsel and his word. He dropped no hint to Le Prun\r\nof his interview with the Marquis de Secqville. His own vanity was at\r\nonce mortified and excited by the discovery he had made. He was resolved\r\nto obliterate the disgrace of having been duped, by the reality of his\r\nmeditated triumph. Love and war have much in common, a truth perhaps\r\nembodied in the allegoric loves of Mars and Venus. Certain, at least, it\r\nis, that in each pursuit all authorities agree that every stratagem is\r\nfair. Blassemare was not the man to rob this canon of its force by any\r\nmorbid scruples of conscience; and having the courage of a lion,\r\nassociated with some of the vulpine attributes, and a certain prankish\r\nlove of mischief, he was tolerably qualified by nature for the\r\nenterprises of rivalry and intrigue.\r\n\r\nLe Prun brooded savagely over his suspected wrongs. He awaited with\r\naffected contempt, but a real and malignant anxiety, the verdict of\r\nBlassemare, who insisted upon deferring his interview with Madame Le\r\nPrun until some weeks had passed over the grave of that \"high and\r\npuissant signer, the Visconte de Charrebourg.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a month after the death of that old gentleman, when\r\nBlassemare, happening to meet Madame Le Prun as she walked upon one of\r\nthe terraces, dressed in so exquisite a suit of mourning, and looking\r\naltogether so irresistibly handsome, that, for the life of him, he could\r\nnot forbear saluting, approaching, and addressing her. He was affably\r\nreceived, and the conversation, at first slight and indifferent, turned\r\ngradually, without premeditation on his part, but, as it were, by a sort\r\nof irresistible fatality, into that sombre and troubled channel whither,\r\nsooner or later, though not exactly then, he had determined to direct\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Le Prun is unaccountably out of spirits, madame--I should say\r\nmorose, ill-tempered. I almost fear to approach him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any thing to surprise one in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no, considering his provocations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Provocations! what do you mean, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame must pardon me. I happen to be in possession of some secrets.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause, during which Madame Le Prun's color came and\r\nwent more than once.\r\n\r\n\"Will Madame Le Prun be so kind as to sit down here for a few minutes,\r\nand I will convince her that I have kept those secrets well, and that I\r\nam--I dare not say her friend--but the most devoted of her servants?\"\r\n\r\nMadame Le Prun sat down upon the marble couch that stood there, carved\r\nwith doves and Cupids, and embowered, in the transparent shadows of\r\nmyrtle, like a throne of Venus. Blassemare fancied that he had never\r\nbeheld so beautiful and piquante an image as Lucille at that moment\r\npresented: her cheeks glowing, her long lashes half dropped over the\r\nquenched fires of her proud dark eyes; her countenance full of a\r\nconfusion that was at once beautiful and sinister; one hand laid upon\r\nher heart, as if to quell its beatings, and shut with an expression half\r\ndefiant, half irresolute--and the pretty fingers of the other\r\nunconsciously playing with the tendrils of a pavenche.\r\n\r\nBlassemare enjoyed this pretty picture too much to disturb it by a word.\r\nPerhaps, too, there was comfort to his vanity in the spectacle of her\r\nhumiliation; at all events he suffered some time to pass before he spoke\r\nto her. When he did, it was with a great deal of respect; for\r\nBlassemare, notwithstanding his coarseness, had a sufficiency of tact.\r\n\r\n\"Madame perceives that I am not without discretion and zeal in her\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you speak enigmas; you talk of secrets and provocation; and while\r\nyou affect an air of deference, your meaning is full of insolence.\"\r\n\r\nIt was plain her pride was mastering her fears, Blassemare thought it\r\nhigh time to lower his key. He therefore said, with a confident smile\r\nand an easy air--\r\n\r\n\"My meaning may be disagreeable, but that is chargeable not upon _me_,\r\nbut on the _circumstances_ of our retrospect; and if I am enigmatical\r\nrather than explicit, I am so from respect, not insolence. My dear\r\nmadame, on the honor of a gentleman, I saw Monsieur le Marquis de\r\nSecqville take his abrupt departure from your window--you understand. I\r\nnot only saw him, but found and retained proofs of his identity, armed\r\nwith which, I taxed him with the fact, and obtained his full confession.\r\n_Now_, madame, perhaps you will give me credit for something better than\r\nhypocrisy and insolence.\"\r\n\r\nLucille looked thunderstruck for a moment, then rising, she darted on\r\nhim a glance of rage and defiance, and overpowered by the tumult within\r\nher, she burst into a flood of tears, and covering her face with her\r\nhands, sobbed in silence, almost hysterically.\r\n\r\nBlassemare waited patiently while she wept on. Suddenly she looked full\r\nand fiercely on him, and cried--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you have told me falsehoods, and dared thus to trifle with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear, madame, on the honor of a nobleman of France, I have told you\r\nthe simple truth. De Secqville did not venture to deny the fact; on the\r\ncontrary, he confessed it frankly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I see you tell me the truth; it was base of De Secqville!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to say truth, I did think he might have kept a lady's secret\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nBlassemare was ready and unscrupulous; but all is fair in love.\r\n\r\n\"I am innocent!\" she cried, with abrupt vehemence, and fixing her fiery\r\ngaze upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say I am innocent, sir. Why do you say _of course_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Because _I_ never knew a lady yet, who was otherwise than innocent.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a lowering contempt--he thought it _guilt_--for a\r\nfew moments, then dropping her gaze gloomily, she murmured, in bitter\r\nabstraction--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was base of De Secqville; he ought to have perished rather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Egad,\" thought Blassemare, \"my project prospers--she is at my\r\nmercy--and disgusted with the Marquis. I'm no general or she surrenders\r\nat discretion.\"\r\n\r\n\"De Secqville, madame, is a handsome fellow; but he admires nobody but\r\nhimself. He has been all his life--and trust me, he is not quite so\r\nyoung as he pretends--a man of intrigue. He is not content with his\r\n_bonnes fortunes_, but he boasts of his conquests, and sacrifices\r\nreputations to his vanity. Such men are not to be trusted with impunity,\r\nor loved without disgrace. It is best never to have favored them, and\r\nnext best to discard them promptly.\"\r\n\r\nHe fancied his speech had hit the fierce temper of his auditor. He\r\npaused for a time, to let it work, and then, in a tone of profound\r\nhumility, said--\r\n\r\n\"As for me, madame, if one so unworthy dare invite a passing thought of\r\nyours, I have but to ask your forgiveness; if I have said one word that\r\ngave you pain, I implore your forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nHere he sank upon his knee. Lucille was by no means as experienced in\r\nthe ways of the wicked gender as many younger women. Blassemare looked\r\nvery humble, and she took his humility in good faith. She looked on him\r\nthen with a softened aspect, and the heart of the profligate beat thick\r\nwith anticipated triumph.\r\n\r\n\"You have had, madame, in these recent transactions, signal proofs of my\r\nfidelity. The secret so lightly esteemed by De Secqville, _I_ would\r\nrather lose my last drop of blood than reveal to a living mortal. I am\r\nsecrecy itself. Judge what I have endured. I have striven--how vainly my\r\nown heart tells me--to hide the sentiments of my soul from you, madame.\r\nI could see with comparative indifference the happiness of that rival\r\nwhom the forms of law, and not the preference of the heart, had\r\nelevated; but judge how I could endure the fortune of an unworthy and\r\nfaithless competitor. Imagine, if you can, my despair. Compassionate, I\r\nconjure you, my misery, and with one relenting word or look of pity,\r\nraise me from the abyss, and see at your feet the happiest, as he is the\r\nmost devoted, of mortals.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Blassemare attempted to take Lucille's hand; it was,\r\nhowever, instantly withdrawn, and the back of it, instead, struck him in\r\nthe face, with all the force of enraged and insulted pride.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you, sirrah, hold such language to me--how _dare_ you? Another\r\nword, and I denounce you to my husband--ay, sir, _I_--to Monsieur Le\r\nPrun. I defy you.\"\r\n\r\nBlassemare had started to his feet, very much astonished; his cheek\r\ntingling, his self-love stung to the quick. But he was too experienced\r\nin such affairs to indulge any tragical emotions on the occasion. He\r\nstared at her for a minute, with an expression of absurd bewilderment.\r\nThere was no very graceful _exit_ from the undignified predicament to\r\nwhich he had, like a simpleton, reduced himself. Recovering his\r\nself-possession, however, he broke into a cold laugh, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Madame, I have misunderstood you with a vengeance; I pray you believe\r\nthat you have misunderstood _me_. We now, however, thoroughly understand\r\none another. I keep your little secret on condition that you keep mine.\"\r\n\r\nLucille deigned no answer; but the compact had, it seemed, been silently\r\nratified by her, for Le Prun and Blassemare continued to be the best\r\nfriends imaginable.\r\n\r\nBlassemare was not vindictive, but he _was_ exquisitely vain. He had a\r\ngood-humored turn for mischief, too; and, notwithstanding the repulse he\r\nhad experienced, or perhaps, such is human perversity--_in consequence_\r\nof it--he was more than ever resolved to pursue his guilty designs upon\r\nthe heart of Madame Le Prun.\r\n\r\nHis hands were, therefore, tolerably full; for he had not only this\r\nlittle affair to attend to, but to exercise his vigilance to prevent De\r\nSecqville's hearing of his breach of faith, and at the same time to\r\nconfirm and exasperate, in furtherance of his own schemes, the\r\nsuspicions of Monsieur Le Prun.\r\n\r\nThis latter task circumstances rendered an easy one, and Blassemare\r\nexecuted it without giving any definite direction to Le Prun's inflamed\r\njealousy. So far, indeed, was he from suspecting the identity of the\r\ncriminal, that he brought De Secqville two or three times to sup at the\r\nChateau des Anges, an act of temerity which excited Blassemare's anxiety\r\nand vigilance. That gentleman had therefore kept so close and constant a\r\nwatch upon the handsome Marquis, that he had not, upon any of these\r\noccasions, an opportunity of exchanging a single sentence with Madame Le\r\nPrun.\r\n\r\nThe occasional appearance of De Secqville at the Chateau des Anges was a\r\nsufficient proof that Blassemare had kept the secret with fidelity.\r\nMadame Le Prun, therefore, was far from suspecting that _he_ was in\r\nsecret the inspiring cause of that ominous restraint, the pressure of\r\nwhich she began to feel every day more and more severely. One by one her\r\npersonal attendants were removed. Gradually she felt the process of\r\nisolation shrouding her from the eyes of her fellow-creatures. Her walks\r\nwere prescribed and restricted; and with bitter resentment she perceived\r\nthat she was subjected to the outrage of a systematic espionage. The\r\nface of M. Le Prun was always darkened with hatred and menace. Every day\r\nmade his power more directly felt, and more nearly reduced her to his\r\nsolitary, rare, and sinister companionship. At last a note, in M. Le\r\nPrun's hand, upon her table, announced in a few barbarous and insulting\r\nwords that his niece Julie had been removed, by his orders, from the\r\ncontagion of a companionship unfit for innocence. This was to Lucille a\r\nfrightful blow. Her solitude was now virtually complete. Her own old\r\nfaithful servant, Marguerite, had been withdrawn; and a tall pale Norman\r\nmatron, taciturn and sardonic, was now her sole attendant. It was plain,\r\ntoo, that M. Le Prun had gradually removed his establishment from the\r\nChateau des Anges. The gay and gorgeous staff of servants and grooms\r\nhad disappeared. The salons, halls, and lobbies of the vast mansion were\r\nsilent as the chambers of a mausoleum--the outer courts still and\r\ndeserted. She was becoming the prisoner of an enraged tyrant, alone, in\r\nthe midst of an impenetrable and funereal solitude.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many prisoners of state enjoyed a great deal more liberty than\r\nshe; for not only was she restricted to her own apartment, but confined\r\nto the range of the small court which lay immediately under her own\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThe indignation and fury which these outrages inspired, by degrees gave\r\nplace to something like despair and panic. With the exception of her\r\nill-looking handmaid, and the no less sinister-visaged sentinel who\r\nstealthily watched her movements, and between both of whom a sort of\r\nominous correspondence seemed to be carried on by signals, she had\r\nlatterly seen no one, but at rare intervals the hated and dreaded\r\napparition of Le Prun at a distance, and Blassemare once or twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--THE ROSE-TREE.\r\n\r\nOne day Lucille was walking in the little court we have described, when\r\nthe door of the park, which we have had occasion to signalize, opened,\r\nand Blassemare stood within a yard or two of her.\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, sir.\"\r\n\r\nA glance at the attendant, who seemed to regard Blassemare as Le Prun's\r\nvicegerent, was sufficient to cause her to withdraw to some distance,\r\nand affecting a light and easy air, which might well mislead the more\r\ndistant observers as to the serious purport of his discourse, he\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid madame is very unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly, I am so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear she is also _in danger_.\"\r\n\r\nShe started as if a bolt of ice had pierced her heart. He had spoken in\r\nthat word the secret fears of many a long night. How inexpressibly more\r\nterrible do our untold terrors become, when they are spoken in our ears\r\nby the lips of strangers!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame, I say in danger. There are odd stories afloat about\r\nMonsieur Le Prun--they may be all lies, I don't pretend to say; for in\r\ntruth I don't very well _comprehend_ my friend Le Prun. But it cannot be\r\nhidden from madame, that when one wants to make away with an individual,\r\nthe first step is to conceal them--to cut them off from all intercourse\r\nwith the world, and cause them to be forgotten. Madame understands me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--oh, my God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame must learn to command herself, if she wishes to prolong our\r\nconversation. We must _appear_, at least, indifferent. There are _spies_\r\nwatching our gestures and countenances, though they can't hear our\r\nwords.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will--thank you, thank you: but for the mercy of God, monsieur, will\r\nyou suffer me to perish?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madame, if you will aid in your own deliverance. Will you fly with\r\nme to-morrow night?\"\r\n\r\n\"If monsieur, for the charity of heaven, will undertake to act only as\r\nmy brother and protector.\"\r\n\r\n\"By my faith, madame, I'll put myself under no conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Blassemare, have you no honor, no pity, no manhood? Will\r\nyou be accessory to a _murder_? I will go with you on no other terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept none, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a coward, sir, and a criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame might command, at least, her countenance and her gestures;\r\nimitate me. You call me hard names; I'm prepared for them. Now listen: I\r\nwon't accept your condition, because, if I did, I should keep my word;\r\nand, I tell you frankly, I won't despair, and I don't despair. But,\r\nmadame, you shan't perish. What do you say to leaving the chateau with\r\nDe Secqville?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _he_ will agree to whatever I propose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when--how?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow night, at ten o'clock, through that door; a coach shall wait\r\nin the park. You know the well under the two chestnut-trees; there he\r\nwill await you; don't fail--a moment late, and all may be lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but how to evade the woman who watches me?\"\r\n\r\n\"She shall be perfectly drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drunker still. Leave all details to me. There are more than one Argus\r\nbesides these; but a man of resource is at home among difficulties.\r\nWatch at ten o'clock. When you see a light in the window of the small\r\npavilion, all is prepared: you will find the door open.\"\r\n\r\nBlassemare signed to the woman to approach, and said, as he bowed his\r\nadieu, in a louder key--\r\n\r\n\"I shall not fail, madame, to report to Monsieur Le Prun the unfortunate\r\ntemper in which I have the honor to find you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have the goodness to add, that I only regret my inability to repeat\r\nthe same sentiments in his presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame shall be obeyed.\"\r\n\r\nSo, with an air of affected defiance on the one side, and of sarcastic\r\nlevity on the other, the two conspirators parted. Her protracted\r\nresidence in the Chateau des Anges, gloomy and anxious before, had\r\nbecome absolutely terrifying since she had heard the dark and menacing\r\ninsinuations used by Blassemare. The evening that followed that scene,\r\nthe night, and the ensuing morning, seemed endless, filled with horrid\r\nimages, and haunted by the hideous thought that the catastrophe might\r\npossibly anticipate the hour of escape, or that some one untoward chance\r\nmight defeat the entire scheme, and leave her at the mercy of a more\r\nthan ever exasperated tyrant.\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on, every incident appeared to her overstrained mind an\r\nomen of good or ill-success. Towards evening the sky became overcast,\r\nand finally an awful thunder-storm swept over the Chateau des Anges. Her\r\nheart sank within her at the inauspicious augury; but as the same\r\ntempest, an hour later, rolled over other regions, it left one trifling\r\ntoken of its passage, which, by a mysterious stroke of fate, was nearly\r\nconnected with her destiny.\r\n\r\nPoor Gabriel, his head full of chimeras, his heart of true love, was\r\nslowly walking through the woodlands of the Parcq de Charrebourg,\r\ntowards that haunted spot, the cottage in which the beautiful demoiselle\r\nhad passed her happiest days, when the storm began to mutter over the\r\nrising grounds, and before he had made much way, the thunder burst above\r\nhis head with fury, and in a little time the rain descended with such\r\ntropical violence as to arrest his further progress, under the dense\r\ncanopy of a chestnut-tree.\r\n\r\nHere he waited until the thunder-clouds had quite passed away; and then,\r\namid red glances of western sunshine, he resumed that pilgrimage, to him\r\nso full of melancholy, of ambition, and of tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"And now, dear, _dear_ Mademoiselle de Charrebourg, I come into your\r\npresence, to learn how it fares with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat, as if expecting to see her looking, as of old, from\r\nthe window of her little room. From the plants that hung from the walls,\r\nand from the struggling bushes, the big rain-drops were trickling, in\r\nthe merry sunlight, like tears of joy. His heart was full as he turned\r\nthe corner of the cottage, and entered the little bowling-green. But,\r\nalas! what a sight awaited him! The rose-tree, the emblem of his adored\r\nmistress, was shivered: the casement, and the wall, and roof, were\r\nshattered, and reduced to a mass of rubbish, by a stroke of lightning.\r\n\r\nGabriel had never felt real desolation before. He rushed to the wide\r\nchasm which now admitted the winds and rains of heaven to the shrine\r\nwhich his adoration and reverence had consecrated with a tenderness so\r\nabsorbing. Oh! what ruin--what profanation--what an irreparable havoc of\r\nall his treasure! And the tree, too--gone, blasted. Tears of passionate\r\ndespair rained from his eyes: he wrung his hands, he stamped, raved, and\r\n\"cursed his day.\"\r\n\r\nIn a little while, however, his thoughts took a different turn. From the\r\nmaterial wreck they passed on to the dire significance which such\r\nportent might indicate.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I came to see how she fares, and behold what I find--torn by\r\nstorms--ruined--dead.\" He stooped, and took up a fragment of the\r\nrose-tree and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\"But the Chateau des Anges is not five leagues away. I will go there. I\r\nwill go now. I will learn what all this means.\"\r\n\r\nWith this resolution he ran fleetly down the slopes of the park, now\r\nwreathed in the rising mists of night, towards the feudal village of\r\nCharrebourg, through which his path lay.\r\n\r\nBreathless and eager, as if heaven were before him and all the fiends of\r\nhell at his heels, he sped through the darkening town, and did not\r\nslacken his speed until he was a full mile beyond it.\r\n\r\nHe had been so absorbed with the single idea that had seized upon his\r\nmind, that he was scarcely conscious of the objects he had passed or the\r\nspeed at which he ran.\r\n\r\nAs he looked round upon the moonlit scenery among which he found\r\nhimself, he felt for a moment stunned and perplexed; he slackened his\r\npace and thought over his expedition. It lost none of its romantic\r\nfascination; he only wondered that he had not made a journey to the\r\nChateau des Anges at least once in every week.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful the moonlight was! how soft the air! how enchanting the\r\nscenery! and oh, what vague possibilities of glory and rapture might not\r\nbe unfolded in the undeveloped future of this wild excursion!\r\n\r\nIt was fully a quarter past twelve when Gabriel reached the point, at\r\nwhich the road directly leading to the Chateau des Anges diverged from\r\nthat which he had been hitherto travelling. Just as he did so, a\r\ncarriage and four, with two postillions and two mounted servants beside,\r\ncame to a sudden stop within a few score paces of the pedestrian, and\r\none of the men dismounting secured some part of the harness which had\r\ngiven way, and was getting into the saddle again when Gabriel arrived at\r\nthe side of the carriage. He then made a momentary pause. In the\r\nbrilliant moonlight every detail of the equipage was visible; the coach\r\nwas dingy and battered, its principal color blue, and covered, according\r\nto the fashion, with gilded arabesques in cumbrous relief, in which a\r\ncurious dragon, with a barbed tongue and tail, was contending in a\r\nhundred repetitions with as many little cupids. Just as these details\r\nseized upon his imagination, the window was suddenly opened, and a lady\r\nput out her head and in thrilling tones cried--\r\n\r\n\"Gabriel, Gabriel--save me, save me.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw Lucille's face; it was her voice that rang in his ears. He felt\r\nhis strength multiplied a hundred fold. He would have, single-handed,\r\nfought an army in such a quarrel. With a cry of delight, that burst from\r\nhis very soul, he sprang to the side of the carriage and grasped the\r\ndoor. Before he reached it, however, some one from within had drawn her\r\naway and shut the window close, and the horses being again in motion,\r\nand rapidly quickening their pace to a gallop, Gabriel ran by the side,\r\ntugging vainly at the door, until one of the mounted attendants,\r\nspurring beside, seized him by the collar, and flung him headlong upon\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nStunned and giddy, he got upon his feet again, and staggered blindly\r\nafter the whirling carriage, uttering threats and defiances as huge as\r\never were thundered from the lips of the renowned knight of La Mancha.\r\nAll would not do, however; the cortege held on its way with whirlwind\r\nspeed. Vainly Gabriel strained every sinew to overtake the coach. The\r\nfell enchanters rapt his peerless mistress from his eyes, and every\r\nmoment the distance between him and them became wider and more hopeless.\r\nAt last, breathless, exhausted, enraged, he was forced to give over the\r\npursuit, after having maintained it for nearly three miles over the\r\npavements of the long straight road.\r\n\r\nIt was on the highway to Paris; thither he assumed they were bound, and\r\nthere he resolved that night should behold him also. Sometimes running,\r\nsometimes walking with hurried strides, he steadily and rapidly pursued\r\nhis way; his imagination every moment filled with images of the strange\r\ngolden dragons and cupids, and the pale, beautiful face of Lucille\r\nshrieking from among them for help.\r\n\r\n\"What then had befallen Lucille?\" The reader shall hear.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom which assured her that Blassemare was at work in the\r\nrealization of this plot, was that her Norman woman, having stayed away\r\nlonger than usual at her suppertime, returned with a very flushed face\r\nand dancing eyes, and altogether in a very hilarious and impertinent\r\nmood. For a long time, however, it appeared that the woman was only\r\n\"pleasantly intoxicated,\" a state in which she would probably prove a\r\nmore effectual check upon her plans of escape than in her ordinary\r\ncondition. Spite of the seriousness of the issue, there was something\r\ninconceivably absurd in this distress. The woman was noisy, familiar,\r\nand sometimes indulged in a vein of menacing jocularity, the principal\r\nmaterial of which was supplied from scraps of old Norman ditties. There\r\nwas one in particular which had a specially grisly sound in the ears of\r\nthe friendless and frightened young wife. It was about a _belle\r\ndemoiselle_--\r\n\r\n    \"Who lived all alone in a castle of brick,\r\n    And all in the night-time this lady fell sick;\r\n    She had eat of a berry that grew by the well,\r\n    And black grow her features--her members they swell;\r\n    This lady is poisoned and so she must lie,\r\n    All stark in her bower with nobody nigh.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this sinister merriment the woman suddenly became\r\ndrowsy, and after a few ineffectual efforts to shake off the torpor that\r\nwas overpowering her, sank into a profound sleep. This occurred in the\r\nanteroom, and, leaving the snoring amazon to the sole occupation of the\r\napartment, Lucille hastened to the bedchamber, from which she commanded\r\na view of the little pavilion, in the window of which she was to expect\r\nthe signal of escape.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark; and with a heart palpitating so violently that she\r\nfelt at times almost suffocating, she watched the hardly discernible\r\noutline of the building from which the signal was to be displayed.\r\n\r\nThe wicked Norman was snoring under the influence of her narcotics; but\r\nto the accompaniment of her abominable drone what a hell of suspense did\r\npoor Lucille endure! At length, and not until considerably past ten\r\no'clock, a light gleamed faintly and for an instant in the appointed\r\nspot, and then disappeared. It returned, however, and now shone\r\nsteadily. The decisive moment which was to commence the adventure had\r\narrived. She murmured an imploring prayer, and turned the bolt of the\r\nwindow which opened on the balcony. Horror of horrors! it was fast\r\nlocked; a strong wire grating covered the outside, so that even had she\r\nventured upon so much noise as would have been necessary in order to\r\nbreak the glass, she would in that have encountered a further obstacle,\r\nto _her_ strength absolutely insurmountable.\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind to escape by the outer door of her suite of rooms,\r\nand to risk all on being able undetected to make her exit in that way\r\nfrom the house. But that door was also locked. She wrung her hands in an\r\nagony of distraction; but she did not abandon the enterprise. Encouraged\r\nby the lusty snoring of the woman, she approached the fauteuil, where\r\nshe lay rather than sat. She slid her hand into the sleeper's pocket,\r\nscarcely daring to breathe while she did so. The keys were not in it;\r\nand the woman turned with something like a start in the chair. Lucille\r\nrecoiled on tiptoe, holding her breath, until she seemed again soundly\r\nasleep. She might have concealed them in her bosom; and with an effort\r\nof resolution Madame Le Prun stepped noiselessly beside her and tried\r\nthere. She was successful, but in drawing out the key her hand brushed\r\nslightly on the slumbering woman's face, and to her unutterable terror\r\nshe started bolt upright in the chair, and stared with a wild and glassy\r\ngaze in her face. Lucille's heart died within her; she froze with\r\nterror; but the action was purely physical, the woman's senses were\r\nstill slumbering; there was no trace of meaning in her face; and in a\r\nfew moments she fell back again in the same profound sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--THE PALACE OF TERROR.\r\n\r\nWith this key Lucille opened the window of the balcony softly. The\r\ndescent from this would at another time have appeared to her a matter of\r\nperil, if not impossibility; nerved, however, by the stake and the\r\nemergency, it was nothing; she was upon the ground. The park door she\r\nfound, as Blassemare had promised, open. She was now amidst the misty\r\nshadows of the solemn wood. She knew the path to the well by which the\r\ntwo chestnut-trees grew, and, with light and trembling steps, ran toward\r\nthe trysting place. The moon had just begun to rise, and afforded a wan\r\nlight, as she reached the appointed spot.\r\n\r\nShe stood beside the well, almost frightened at the success of her\r\nadventure. A figure emerged from a thicket close by. It was that of a\r\nman in a huge red cloak, and with a great cocked hat, like that of a\r\n_gens-d'armes_. Could this possibly be De Secqville? He whistled a\r\nshrill summons as he approached, and she heard the sound of steps\r\nhurrying to the spot. She was full of fear, apprehensive of treason and\r\ndanger. The gentleman in the cocked hat was now close to her. He had\r\nlong black hair, descending upon his shoulders, a pair of shaggy\r\neyebrows, and a preposterous pair of black moustaches. She asked, in a\r\nfaltering voice--\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"An officer, madame, of the police; and you are Madame Lucille Le Prun,\r\n_nee_ de Charrebourg, wife of Etienne Le Prun; and I arrest you in the\r\nKing's name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrest me!--why?--upon what charge?--who is my accuser?\"\r\n\r\n\"By my faith, madame, I know not. My duty is, simply to arrest you, in\r\nthe name of his Majesty, and to convey you to Paris. It is nothing very\r\nbad, I fancy. Perhaps you have made monsieur a little jealous, or so;\r\nbut you know best.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a harsh, gruff voice, and his hand rested upon her arm, so\r\nas to render escape impossible, while he addressed her.\r\n\r\n\"By what authority do you arrest me?--by what order?\"\r\n\r\n\"By virtue of this _lettre-de-cachet_; you see, madame, signed by the\r\nminister of police.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot read it; there is not light sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ma foi_, madame, there is little sunshine at half-past eleven o'clock\r\nat night. I can't help that. Madame will please to come with us.\"\r\n\r\nTwo men by this time had appeared close at hand; and Madame Le Prun, who\r\nmuch preferred one of the King's prisons to that in which her husband\r\nwas absolute, accompanied her captors with a far better grace than under\r\nother circumstances she would have done.\r\n\r\nDistant a few score steps, upon a sort of grass-grown road, which\r\ntraversed the park, stood the equipage which we have already described;\r\nand in a few seconds Lucille found herself seated beside the red cloak\r\nand mighty moustache, that held her in durance, jolting and rolling at a\r\nrapid pace along the moonlit scenery of the park.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I going?--to the Bastile?\" asked Lucille, when a few minutes\r\nhad a little recovered her from the stun and confusion of this\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\"Hum!--why, no, madame--not the Bastile; you are going to a convent.\"\r\n\r\n\"A convent!--how strange! What convent?\"\r\n\r\n\"That of the Sisters of Love and Our Lady of the Sparkling Eyes--an\r\nancient foundation of royalty in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say; I never heard of it before;\" and Lucille sank into profound\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable interval, she asked, with a tremulousness she in\r\nvain tried to conceal--\r\n\r\n\"There were some friends who were to have arranged my departure from the\r\nplace where you arrested me to-night--did you see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; there was the atribilious Marquis de Secqville and the\r\nhandsome Conte de Blassemare. St. Imay arrested them about half-an-hour\r\nago; _they_ are gone to the Bastile.\"\r\n\r\nLucille sighed profoundly. She did not observe that the farouche officer\r\nin the corner of the coach was shaking with suppressed laughter. After a\r\ntime he ejaculated, in a sepulchral tone--\r\n\r\n\"I strongly suspect their punishment will be dreadful. It is bad enough\r\nto conspire to steal away the wife of a respectable curmudgeon, madame,\r\nbut to draw one's sword on the king's police!--_ma foi_, madame, that is\r\nanother affair. If his majesty's clemency be enlisted, notwithstanding,\r\nin their behoof, they may chance to get off with the galleys. It will be\r\na dreadful sight to see that solemn De Secqville and that jovial\r\nBlassemare pulling one of those cursed long oars together, in red serge\r\nshirts, cursing Cupid and Monsieur Le Prun.\"\r\n\r\nLucille shrunk back into the obscurity of her corner. The officer could\r\nnot discern how his brusque communication had affected her; but, after a\r\nshort silence, he burst into an unrestrained peal of laughter. This\r\nunseasonable insolence incensed his prisoner. She felt, however, that\r\nshe was at his mercy, and commanded herself; but she could not avoid\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n\"If the calamities of other people afford you entertainment, monsieur, I\r\ncan congratulate you upon possessing an inexhaustible fund of amusement\r\nin the discharge of your odious and melancholy office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amusement! entertainment!\" he ejaculated, with another eclat of\r\nlaughter, still more obstreperous. \"I can't help laughing; but it is\r\nmerely hysterical, on the faith of a gentleman. I laugh in proportion to\r\nmy desolation. I could at this moment tear out my beard by handfuls\r\nthrough sheer despair. _Par exemple_, madame, _par exemple_!\" And, with\r\na frantic gesture and a roar of laughter, he literally tore off his huge\r\nmoustache with both his hands, at a single pluck. \"And my chevelure\r\nalso, madame. See, here it goes--all for despair--hurra, hurra, hurrah!\r\nAnd my eyebrows--ay, they, too--pa ma foi--the eyebrows--there,\r\npresto--hurra, hurra!\"\r\n\r\nHe shook and roared with laughter as he made these successive\r\nsacrifices, and, shifting his seat, so that the moonlight fell full upon\r\nhim, cried, panting from exhaustion--\r\n\r\n\"Does not madame know me?--is it possible? Here I am--cloak, cocked hat,\r\nwig, all gone--in the proper costume of madame's fortunate and adoring\r\ndeliverer.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Blassemare, for it was he, descended, as well as he could,\r\nupon one knee, and seizing Lucille's hand, pressed it to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Blassemare, you insult me, sir; you forget the conditions upon\r\nwhich I trusted myself to your care.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, there are _no_ conditions. Madame will please to remember I\r\nwould accept none.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the carriage stopped at the point where Gabriel was at\r\nthat instant about to pass.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go, sir--I will descend. Open the door, I am free--I insist, I\r\ndesire to leave the carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no--pray be tranquil--it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _will_ descend, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame, _you shall not_.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a good-humored and emphatic impudence which implied the\r\nmost perfect resolution. A vague terror took possession of her. She\r\nrushed to the window, and Blassemare, with a gentle force, drew her\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIt was at that moment she saw Gabriel, and shrieked to him for help.\r\n\r\nThe coach was again thundering at a gallop along the highway. Lucille\r\nsank back in the corner, and wept with mingled anger and despair.\r\nBlassemare was not a ruffian, so he said, \"Madame, calm yourself, I wish\r\nto treat you with respect; your suspicions wound me as much as your\r\ningratitude. I hope, however, that both will vanish on reflection. In\r\nthe meantime, I cannot consent to so insane a measure as your leaving\r\nthe carriage. Your return to the Chateau des Anges is not to be thought\r\nof; you dare not go back; and pardon me, madame, I will not permit you\r\nto leave this carriage except for a place of safety and temporary\r\nconcealment.\"\r\n\r\nLucille's haughty and fiery temper could hardly brook this hoity-toity\r\nassumption of authority. There was, however, an obvious vein of reason\r\nin what he said; and she saw, besides, the futility of contending with\r\none whose will was probably as strong as her own, and backed with power\r\nto make it effectual. She therefore maintained a moody silence, and\r\nBlassemarre, deeming it best to suffer her ill-humor to expend itself\r\nharmlessly, awaited better moments in congenial taciturnity.\r\n\r\nHaving got a relay of fresh horses upon the way, they continued their\r\njourney at the same furious pace, and at last they entered Paris.\r\nPassing through streets which hemmed her in, or opened in long vistas\r\nlike the fantastic scenery of a dream, hurrying onward, she knew not\r\nwhither, under swinging lamps, amidst silence and desertion, the\r\ncarriage at last drove under a narrow archway into a sort of fore-court,\r\nover which a dark mass of building was looming, and through a second\r\ngateway in this, into an inclosed quadrangle, surrounded by the same\r\nblack pile of buildings.\r\n\r\nHere the carriage stopped, and one of the attendants, dismounting, rang\r\na hall bell, whose deep sudden peal through empty vastness gave a\r\ncharacter of profound desolation to the silence in which it was\r\nswallowed. More than once the summons was repeated, and at last a faint\r\nlight gleamed upon the windows, and the door was timorously unbarred and\r\nopened. A hard-featured hag, in a faded suit of an obsolete fashion--the\r\n_genius loci_--received the party. She scrutinized Lucille with a\r\nprotracted stare of audacious inquisitiveness, and when she had quite\r\nsatisfied her curiosity, she led the way through several halls and\r\nlobbies up the great staircase, along a corridor, through a suite of\r\nrooms, upon another lobby up a second staircase, into a great dreary\r\npassage, through half a dozen waste and desolate chambers, and so at\r\nlast into a room which had a few pieces of furniture at one end of it,\r\nand a log of wood smouldering and smoking on the hearth.\r\n\r\nIn truth it was a melancholy place, haunted by dismal reverberations and\r\na deathlike atmosphere--everywhere mildewed, faded, and half rotten with\r\ndecay. It was a place where crimes might be committed, unrecorded and\r\nunsuspected--where screams would lose themselves in vacancy, and\r\ndesolation and solitude would swallow up the ghastly evidences of\r\noutrage. Here was the fitting scenery for tales of preternatural terror\r\nor fiendish crime. Lucille felt her heart sink within her as she entered\r\nthis vast and awful labyrinth. But she felt that, be her destiny what it\r\nmight, she had herself no power to mend it. What resource was left to\r\nher? Necessity retained her amidst the menacing solitudes of this\r\nhalf-ruined mansion.\r\n\r\nBlassemare left her to the care of the old crone, who, to judge from\r\nappearances, was hardly an improvement upon the ungracious attendant she\r\nhad left at the Chateau des Anges. This hag had evidently the worst\r\npossible opinion of her guest, and took no pains to affect a respect\r\nwhich she was far from feeling. She contented herself with offering\r\nLucille some supper, and this declined, showed her the bedroom that was\r\nprepared for her--a room of the same depressing vastness, and offering,\r\nin its shabby and niggard furniture, a contrast to its majestic\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nSuch as it was, however, it was welcome. Lucille was exhausted with the\r\nanxieties and agitations of the day, as well as with her late and rapid\r\njourney. Having examined the room with a fearful scrutiny, she succeeded\r\nin bolting one of the doors, and placed the only chair the room\r\ncontained against the other; so that she might, at least, be warned by\r\nthe noise, in the event of any persons forcing an entrance. She lay down\r\nwithout taking off her clothes, and leaving the candle unextinguished.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the excitement of her strange situation, and the alarms\r\nthat environed her, chased sleep away, worn and exhausted as she was.\r\nAfter a while, however, fatigue began to confuse her thoughts with\r\ninterposing visions. The dreary chamber faded from her view; her heavy\r\neyelids closed; fantastic scenes and images chased one another through\r\nher wearied brain, and slumber stole gradually upon her, overpowering\r\nspirit and body with a sweet torpor.\r\n\r\nFrom this profound sleep Lucille was disturbed by a peremptory knocking\r\nat the door of the room, which she had bolted. This was accompanied by\r\nviolent and reiterated attempts to force it open. At first, these sounds\r\nhad mingled with her dreams; but the noise of a struggle, the suppressed\r\ntones of a man's voice, speaking rapidly and fiercely, followed by one\r\nthrilling maniacal scream, which hurried away through the remote\r\npassages, until it either subsided, or was lost in distance, called her\r\nup from her slumbers, trembling with terror.\r\n\r\nSleep was effectually dispelled, and, overcome with the horror of her\r\nsituation, she wept, and prayed, and watched through the remainder of\r\nthe night. In the morning she heard the old woman arranging the next\r\nroom, and soon the voice of Blassemare. Emboldened by the daylight, and\r\nconfident that Blassemare, however insulting his designs, would at all\r\nevents protect her from actual violence, she opened the door, and\r\nentered the outer chamber, looking so pale, haggard, and fear-stricken,\r\nthat the _roue_ himself felt a momentary emotion of compassion.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.--THE GRATED WINDOW.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Blassemare,\" she said, abruptly, \"I cannot remain here!\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not, madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have passed a night of terror.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be happy to protect madame.\"\r\n\r\nThe significance of his tone, made her eyes flash and her cheeks tingle;\r\nbut she controlled her indignation, and said--\r\n\r\n\"I last night heard the sounds of violence and agony at my very door--in\r\nthis apartment. Who was the woman that screamed? What have they done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell you?\" asked Blassemare, with an odd smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monsieur, who was she?\" she persisted, her curiosity aroused by\r\nthe pointed question of Blassemare.\r\n\r\n\"Well, madame, the person whom you heard scream at your door last\r\nnight is Madame Le Prun, wife of the Fermier-General--the\r\nwealthy and benevolent owner of the Chateau des Anges, and your\r\nsuccessful--_lover_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wife--_wife_ of Monsieur Le Prun!\" she faltered, nearly stupefied.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, madame, his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, thank God, he has no control over me. I am free!--that, at least,\r\nis a happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, madame, you will not find it so easy to satisfy our tribunals--you\r\nseem to have forgotten the necessity of _proofs_. In the mean time, you\r\nare _de facto_ the wife of Monsieur Le Prun, and he will exert,\r\naccording to law, the rights and authority of a husband over you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Blassemare, for God's sake, help me--help me in this\r\nfrightful extremity!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame, the fact is, I must be plain with you. If I mix myself further\r\nin this frightful affair, as you justly term it, I must lay my account\r\nwith serious perils. Men do not run their heads into mischief for\r\nnothing; and, therefore, if I act as your champion, I must be accepted\r\nas your lover also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Monsieur de Blassemare, you cannot be serious!--you will not be so\r\ninhuman as to desert me!\"\r\n\r\n\"By my faith, madame, the age of knight-errantry is over--nothing for\r\nnothing is the ruling principle of our own prosaic day. To be plain with\r\nyou, I can't afford to quarrel with Le Prun for nothing; and, if you\r\npersist in refusing my services, I must only make it up with him as best\r\nI can; and of course you return to the Chateau des Anges.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe you, Monsieur de Blassemare; I won't believe you. You\r\nare a gentleman--kind, honorable, humane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gad!--so I am, madame; but I am no professed redresser of wrongs. I\r\nnever interpose between husband and wife--or those who pass for\r\nsuch--without a sufficient motive. Now, Monsieur Le Prun believes I have\r\ngone down to his estate at Lyons, but he will have intelligence of your\r\nflight to-day, and he will learn, in a few days more, that _I_ have also\r\ndisappeared. The fact is, my complicity can't remain a secret long. You\r\nsee, madame, I must take my course promptly. It altogether rests with\r\nyou to decide what it shall be. But you are fatigued and excited: don't\r\npronounce in too much haste. Consider your position, and I shall have\r\nthe honor to present myself again in the course of the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not attempt to detain him, or, indeed, to reply. Her thoughts\r\nwere too distracted.\r\n\r\nLucille, alone once more, became a prey to the terror of another visit\r\nfrom the so-called Madame Le Prun, whose ill-omened approaches had\r\ninspired her with so much terror on the night preceding.\r\n\r\nThe chambers looked, if possible, more decayed and dilapidated by\r\ndaylight than they had upon the preceding night. She went to the\r\nwindows, but they afforded no more cheering prospect--looking out upon a\r\ndark courtyard, round which the vast hotel rose in sombre\r\naltitude--dreary, inauspicious, and colossal. The court was utterly\r\ndeserted, and the gate leading from it into the fore-court was closed\r\nand barred. The Bastile itself would have been cheerful compared with\r\nthis vast and fearful castle of solitude, or, as it might be, _worse_.\r\nThe sense of absolute defencelessness added poignancy to her fears of a\r\nrenewed visit from some ill-disposed denizen of the mansion; and her\r\nfears at last became so strong, that she ventured to leave the rooms\r\nwhere she had been established, intending to retreat to some part of the\r\nhouse where her presence might at all events be less certainly expected\r\nthan where she was. Accordingly she was soon wending among all the\r\nintricacies and solemn grandeur of a huge and half-ruinous hotel.\r\nDescending, at last, a turret stair, she came to a small stone chamber,\r\nin which was a little grated window. Standing upon a block of stone, she\r\nlooked through the strong bars of this little aperture, and perceived\r\nthat it was but some six or seven feet above the pave of a dark and\r\nnarrow lane. She would have given worlds to escape from the prison in\r\nwhich she found herself, but the close, thick bars rendered all chance\r\nof making that a passage of escape wholly desperate.\r\n\r\nAs she looked wistfully through, a little ragged urchin came whistling\r\ncarelessly along the lane, kicking a turnip before him.\r\n\r\nShe called the gamin: he was a shrewd monkey-faced fellow, with an\r\ninsolent crafty eye.\r\n\r\n\"My good boy, here is a louis-d'or, as earnest of twenty more which I\r\nwill give you, if you bring this safely to Monsieur le Marquis de\r\nSecqville, at the Hotel de Secqville, Rue St. Etienne, and conduct him\r\nhither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, mademoiselle! it is a bargain. But how shall I know you\r\nagain?--what is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Madame Le Prun; but the marquis will tell you where I am to be\r\nfound. See, here is the note!\"\r\n\r\nShe had written a few lines upon a leaf of her tablet. She tore it off,\r\ndirected it, and then threw it out to the boy, together with the\r\npromised coin. He ran away, chuckling and singing upon his errand,\r\nbelieving his fortune made, and in an instant was out of sight.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how he fared.\r\n\r\nAs the demon of contrariety would have it, Monsieur Le Prun, almost\r\ninsane with rage and spite, had, not five minutes before, dismounted at\r\nthe Hotel de Secqville, to consult the marquis respecting the flight of\r\nMadame Le Prun. He had certainly chosen his advisers well. The marquis,\r\nas it happened, was out, and Le Prun, who, of course, had access under\r\nall circumstances to the interior of the hotel, established himself in\r\nthe private apartment of De Secqville, awaiting his return.\r\n\r\nWhile there, the servant brought in the pencil-note on which so much\r\ndepended.\r\n\r\n\"It must be intended for monsieur,\" said the man presenting it upon his\r\nsalver, \"for the messenger says it comes from Madame Le Prun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!--ha!--let us see! Ten thousand devils, what is this?\"\r\n\r\nHe read--\r\n\r\n\"Relying upon your professions of devotion, I implore of you to deliver\r\nme from a prison as terrifying as that of which my husband was the\r\njailer. The messenger, a little boy whom fortune has sent to me, will\r\nconduct you to this spot. I know not the name of the street, nor of the\r\nhotel. In the name of heaven lose not a moment!\r\n\r\n    \"LUCILLE.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun descended the stairs, and was in the street in a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\"Well, garcon, here I am--I've got the note--conduct me to the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha! then you are--the marquis?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I am. Here, boy, take this, and lead on.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave him a piece of money, and, following his little guide, Le Prun,\r\nin less than half an hour, reached the spot from which he had started.\r\n\r\n\"Bon jour, madame. I hope you have recovered the fatigue of your night's\r\njourney. You see I lose no time in hastening to bid you welcome.\"\r\n\r\nSo cried Monsieur Le Prun, with a sardonic grin upon his pale face, as\r\nhe bowed to the horror-stricken girl, who still occupied the little\r\nwindow, where she expected so different an image.\r\n\r\nShe fled from this spectre as if she had seen the Evil One incarnate.\r\nFlying wildly through the passages and chambers of the deserted house,\r\nshe found herself on a sudden in an apartment furnished like an office,\r\nwith shelves, desks, &c., and here Blassemare was sitting among a pile\r\nof papers. He started on seeing her, and she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Le Prun has seen me--he will be here in a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Here!_--where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He saw me in the window, and spoke to me with furious irony from the\r\nstreet. For God's sake, hide me. I feel that he will kill me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!--so. Gad, he _will_ be here in a moment. I must meet him boldly--I\r\nhave nothing for it but impudence. A few fibs, and, if the worst should\r\ncome, my sword. But don't be frightened, madame, he shan't hurt _you_.\"\r\n\r\nBlassemare proceeded to the court, awaiting the advent of his incensed\r\npatron.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.--THE WOMAN IN FLANNEL.\r\n\r\nWe must now, with the reader's leave, follow Gabriel to Paris, where he\r\narrived fully three hours later than the fugitive cortege. He wandered\r\nfor more than an hour among the streets, in the hope of catching a\r\nglimpse of the coach with the blue panels, and the golden cupids and\r\ndragons so curiously interlaced; but we need not say how vainly.\r\n\r\nWorn out with fatigue, hungry and cold--for the nights were now very\r\nchill--and without a sou in his pocket, poor Gabriel, having wandered\r\nfor some hours among the streets of this great city, now emptied of all\r\nbut its crime and destitution, at last found shelter for the night in an\r\nempty cask, which had served probably as a dog-kennel in an open\r\nworkyard into which he strayed. In this he made his bed with a few\r\narmfuls of shavings, and, spite of the cold, slept soundly till morning.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the charity of a poor woman, who gave him a piece of\r\nblack bread, he might have starved. Refreshed, however, with this\r\ndainty, he prosecuted his rambles. Among other wonderful sights, he saw\r\nthe splendid equipages of many of the nobility, drawn up in the street\r\nbefore the mansion of the minister, who was holding a levee. Fortune\r\nseemed to have directed his steps thither, for he saw a familiar face\r\namong the splendid throng who glided in and out at the great man's\r\nportals. This was no other than the Marquis de Secqville, who was\r\npassing to his carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pray, Monsieur Dubois, monsieur, don't you know me?\"\r\n\r\nSo cried poor Gabriel in his eagerness, forcing himself to the front\r\nrank of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"No, my good friend, no,\" answered the marquis, hesitating and\r\nsurprised; \"I do not recollect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you recollect the park of Charrebourg, monsieur, and the boy who\r\nsometimes carried your game, Gabriel, who was so frequently your\r\nattendant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! by my faith, so it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but monsieur, I want to consult you about a lady who, I fear, is\r\nin distress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us hear,\" continued the marquis, feeling in his pocket for\r\nhis purse, and smiling.\r\n\r\n\"It is Mademoiselle Lucille--that is, I mean, Madame Le Prun. You have\r\nheard of her, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis could not restrain a start at the name; but affecting haste,\r\nhe desired one of his servants to give the boy a cloak, and directing\r\nhim to roll himself up in it, and jump into the carriage, he followed\r\nhim thither, amidst the wonder and gibes of the crowd, and in a few\r\nminutes they were at the Hotel de Secqville.\r\n\r\nThe marquis, having learned all that Gabriel had to disclose, was\r\nutterly at fault as to what steps it was prudent for him to take. It was\r\njust possible that the removal of the lady from the Chateau des Anges\r\nmight be a measure of Monsieur Le Prun's. This seemed to him more than\r\nprobable, and the hypothesis prevented his having recourse to the\r\nminister of police. He, however, lost not a moment in adopting such\r\nmeasures as the resources of his wealth enabled him to command. In the\r\ncourse of the afternoon he had nearly a score of paid agents,\r\nexcellently qualified for the task, pushing their sagacious inquiries in\r\nevery quarter.\r\n\r\nHe had promised to sup with some of the officers of his regiment, in the\r\nquartier de St. Thomas du Louvre, and he had there appointed his\r\nemissaries to meet him, having also directed Gabriel, whom he retained\r\nin his service, to call for him there, with a flambeau, at twelve\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nGabriel was destined to another adventure in executing these directions,\r\nsimple as they were.\r\n\r\nAs he was on his way, he was suddenly set upon, in a deserted spot at\r\nthe end of the Pont St. Michel, by four robbers. He brandished his\r\nflambeau, and shouted for help; but he was instantly disarmed, and a\r\nsword at his throat reduced him to silence. Disappointed of money, they\r\nproceeded to undress him with a running accompaniment of threats and\r\ncurses, and in a trice had left poor Gabriel standing in his shirt,\r\nwhile they made good their retreat.\r\n\r\nIt was bitter cold, and, what made it worse still, rather windy; and\r\nafter a few moments of hesitation, he began to retrace his steps towards\r\nthe Hotel de Secqville at the top of his speed. As ill luck would have\r\nit, however, this course led him unconsciously upon the track of the\r\nfour brethren of the road, who, convinced that he was dogging them,\r\nturned about, and, with awful menaces and drawn swords, recommenced the\r\npursuit with the most murderous designs.\r\n\r\nOf course Gabriel had nothing for it but his fleetness of limb. He ran\r\nas fast as he could toward the Quai des Augustins. At that moment a\r\ncoach was passing at a furious speed, and thinking of nothing but his\r\nsafety, he jumped nimbly up behind.\r\n\r\nHe had distanced the thieves, and the sound of pursuit was no longer\r\nheard. The wind often whirled his shirt, his only covering, over his\r\nhead, and he could not control its vagaries, for both his hands were\r\nengaged in retaining his position; and, indeed, so numbing was the cold,\r\nhardly sufficed for the purpose. Could any thing more undignified or\r\nuncomfortable be imagined?\r\n\r\nHis teeth were chattering, his hands numb, his shirt sporting cruelly in\r\nthe blast, yet, spite of his misery, he did not fail to observe, in the\r\ndull moonlight, that the carriage was blue, and decorated with gilded\r\ndragons and cupids in relief. It was, in short, he could have no doubt,\r\nthe very carriage which had conveyed away Lucille. Forgetting his\r\nnakedness, and even his cold, in the astonishment of this discovery, he\r\nawaited, with the intensest interest, the conclusion of an adventure\r\nwhich promised to furnish him with a clue to the present habitation of\r\nthe concealed lady.\r\n\r\nThe carriage continued to drive at a furious rate, and having passed the\r\nCollege des Quatre Nations, it took the line of the Pont Rouge (now\r\nperfectly deserted), in the middle of which it came to a full stop.\r\n\r\nTwo gentlemen descended; they looked up and down the bridge to ascertain\r\nthat all was quiet. One of them came so close that the plumed fringe of\r\nhis cocked hat almost touched Gabriel, who was cowering as close as\r\npossible to escape notice. His surprise at their stopping at a place\r\nwhere there was no house or dwelling of any sort was soon changed to\r\nhorror, when he saw these gentlemen carry a corpse out of the carriage,\r\nwhich, by its long hair, he perceived to be that of a female, and\r\nproject it over the battlements of the bridge into the river.\r\n\r\nThey then re-entered the carriage, which again turning toward the\r\nLouvre, retraced its way. Was that pale corpse, with its long tresses,\r\nthe murdered body of the fair and beloved Lucille? Were her assassins\r\nunconsciously hurrying through the dark in company with him? Torture,\r\ndespair, vengeance!\r\n\r\nAt the same mad pace this carriage drove through deserted streets,\r\nscarce encountering a human being--Gabriel still clinging to his\r\nposition, and exciting many a strange surmise, as, half seen, he was\r\nwhirled beside such stray passengers as were still abroad.\r\n\r\nAt length it turned abruptly--thundered through a narrow archway into a\r\nfore-court, and then through a second, into the dark quadrangle of the\r\nhalf ruinous and vast hotel, to which we conducted Lucille.\r\n\r\nGabriel jumped nimbly to the ground, and, unperceived, glided into the\r\nshadow of the archway, intending to escape through the outer gate, and\r\nspread the alarm of murder. This door was, however, already secured, and\r\nhearing steps, he glided along under the shadow until he reached the\r\nopen door of a stable, and climbing to the loft, found some hay there,\r\nin which, nearly dead with cold, he buried himself.\r\n\r\nLet us now follow Monsieur Le Prun, whom we left in a high state of\r\nmalignant frenzy, approaching the entrance of the desolate building.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!--Blassemare,\" he said, with a livid smile, the meaning of which was\r\nobvious, in reply to that gentleman's fearless salutation, \"you have\r\nmade good speed from the south. How goes all at Lyons? Come, come, the\r\nparticulars?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not been there at all; I altered my plans; not without just\r\nreason. I have removed Madame Le Prun here; the fact is, I had reason to\r\nsuspect a design to escape. It was nearly ripe; the _eclat_ of such a\r\nthing would have been scandalous. I disorganized the whole affair, and\r\nhave placed her here under your own roof; I had to use stratagem for the\r\npurpose, but I succeeded; she is still safe--the plot has failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than one plot, perhaps, has failed, sir,\" said Le Prun, with a\r\nlook of lowering scrutiny; \"I have exploded one myself. Let me see\r\nMadame Le Prun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to see her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--conduct me to her at once.\"\r\n\r\nBlassemare, with a malicious smile and shrug, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Well, monsieur, you shall be obeyed; let us proceed to Madame Le Prun,\r\nby all means.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way; they ascended a staircase, Le Prun growing gloomier and\r\ngloomier at every step.\r\n\r\nSmothering his malicious laughter, Blassemare glided past him, and\r\nopening a door exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Madame, a gentleman desires the honor of an interview; Monsieur Le Prun\r\nattends you.\"\r\n\r\nLe Prun entered; a step was heard in a recess opening from the room, and\r\na form entered, before which he recoiled as from a malignant spectre.\r\n\r\n\"Is it _this_ one or the other?\" asked Blassemare, with much simplicity.\r\n\r\nLe Prun did not hear him; he was astounded and overpowered in the\r\npresence of the phantom-like form that stood in its strange draperies of\r\nflannel at the other end of the chamber, eyeing him askance, with a look\r\nof more than mortal hate.\r\n\r\n\"It is not fair to disturb such a meeting; the domestic affections, eh?\r\nhad best be indulged in private.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Blassemare abruptly withdrew, and shut the door sharply upon\r\nthe pair.\r\n\r\nRoused by the sound, Le Prun attempted to follow him, but his agitation\r\nprevented his being able to open the door, and he cursed Blassemare from\r\nthe bottom of his soul, in the belief that he had bolted it.\r\n\r\n\"So, face to face at last,\" she said; \"for years you have escaped me;\r\nfor years your agents have persecuted and imprisoned me. I heard of your\r\ncourtship--aye, and your marriage, and rejoiced at it, for I knew it\r\ncould bring you nothing but grief; accursed monster, murderer of my\r\nsister, attempted murderer of myself, seducer and betrayer of the girl\r\nyou call your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, she is my wife,\" stammered Le Prun, recovering his voice.\r\n\r\n\"No, miscreant! that she cannot be; well you know that _I_ am your\r\nwife.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a lie; I have that under your own hand; it is a lie, a lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you fancy that, because intimidated by a murderer, I signed the\r\npaper you speak of, the document has lost its force, and I ceased to be\r\nyour wife? No, no; adulterer and poisoner that you are, I retain the\r\nright to blast you; you shall yet taste retribution; you shall perish by\r\na bloody end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.--CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nBlassemare read in Le Prun's countenance that there was an end of their\r\nconnection. He was, however, a man of resource, and whatever the loss\r\ninvolved in the severance, he was not dismayed. He made up his mind to\r\nquarrel with _eclat_, and sitting himself down upon the window-sill,\r\nlaughed with a sardonic glee at the rencontre he had just brought about.\r\nIn a little while, however, he began to wonder at its length, and after\r\na while he was startled by Le Prun's voice calling him by name, and at\r\nthe same time by a furious knocking at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!--why don't you come here if you want me?\" cried Blassemare.\r\n\r\n\"I can't--you _know_ I can't--you have locked the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've _not_--try it,\" replied Blassemare, coolly.\r\n\r\nIn a moment more Le Prun entered, trembling like a man in an ague, his\r\nface livid and covered with a cold sweat.\r\n\r\n\"That, that accursed fiend, she has--the murderess--she attempted my\r\nlife--upon my soul she did.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some blood upon his hand, and more upon his lace cravat.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" said Blassemare, growing very pale. \"Why, why, you\r\nhave not, great God, you have not hurt the wretched woman?\" and he\r\ngrasped him by the collar with a hand that trembled with mingled fury\r\nand horror.\r\n\r\n\"It was _she_, I tell you--let me go--it was she--she that tried--by\r\n----, she had a knife at my throat--I could not help it--I'm\r\nruined--help me, Blassemare--for God's sake, help me--what--what is to\r\nbe done?\"\r\n\r\nBlassemare gave him a look of contemptuous fury, turned from him, and\r\nentered the chamber.\r\n\r\nLe Prun stood like one stupefied, stammering excuses and oaths, and\r\ntrembling as if it were the day of judgment.\r\n\r\nBlassemare reentered, paler than before, and said--\r\n\r\n\"You cowardly, barbarous miscreant, you will answer for it here and\r\nhereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blassemare, my friend--my dear friend--in the name of God, don't\r\ndenounce me. You would not; no, you could not. I have been a good friend\r\nto you. For the love of God, help me, Blassemare--save me. You shall\r\nhave half my fortune; I'll stick at no terms; I'll make you, by ---- the\r\nrichest man in Paris. You shall have what you like--every thing, any\r\nthing--only help me in this accursed extremity.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Blassemare met his abject and agonized entreaties with\r\na stoical scorn; at last, however, he relented.\r\n\r\nThe body was removed that night; and it is well known to the readers of\r\nold French trials, how wonderfully Providence supplied by a chain of\r\napparent accidents, an important witness in our friend Gabriel.\r\n\r\nWe left him buried in the hay of the stable-loft. We must pursue his\r\nadventure to its conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had a little recovered the heat which was nearly\r\nextinguished, he got up, and finding an old piece of drugget, he wrapped\r\nit about him in the fashion of a cloak; and having looked in vain for\r\nany window opening upon the street, he climbed, by the aid of the\r\njoists, to an aperture in the half-rotten roof, and passing through it,\r\ncrept like a cat along, until he reached the spout, down which, at the\r\nrisk of his neck, he climbed. He was now safe in the public street.\r\nPicking up a sharp stone, he scratched some marks, such as he could\r\neasily recognize again, upon the gateway. He then knocked at a barber's\r\nshop, nearly opposite, where he saw a light, and asked the name of the\r\nstreet, and his route to the Hotel de Secqville.\r\n\r\nThe marquis had arrived before him; and his amazement at the strange\r\nattire of his retainer was changed to horror, when he learned the\r\nparticulars of his adventure.\r\n\r\nNot a moment was lost by De Secqville in applying to the police, and,\r\nwith an officer and a party of archers, he proceeded at once to the\r\nHotel St. Maurice--for such was the name of the nearly ruinous building\r\nwe have described. There they arrested Monsieur Le Prun, who was just\r\nemerging from the gate as they arrived; as also Blassemare, whom they\r\nsurprised in his room. No definite suspicion, beyond the conjectures of\r\nDe Secqville, had as yet attached to either of these gentlemen; but some\r\nexpressions which escaped Le Prun, upon his arrest, were of a character\r\nto excite the profoundest suspicions of his guilt.\r\n\r\nBlassemare instantly tendered his evidence, and in the course of it was\r\nforced to make disclosures very little creditable to himself. The old\r\nwoman, Gertrude Peltier, who resided in the house, and had attended upon\r\nLucille, was also examined, and a servant named St. Jean, a sort of\r\ngroom, who had been a long time in Le Prun's service, also deposed to\r\nsome important facts. This evidence, collected and reduced to a\r\nnarrative form, was to the following effect:--\r\n\r\nIt seemed that, about twenty-four years before, Le Prun had privately\r\nmarried an actress of the Theatre ----, named Emilie Guadin. They had\r\nlived together--not very happily--by reason, as was supposed, of her\r\nviolent temper. Her sister, Marie Guadin, resided with them. After about\r\nfour years it began to be rumored that Monsieur Le Prun was about to be\r\nmarried to the widow of an immensely rich merchant of Bourdeaux. The\r\nstrict privacy and isolation in which his wife and her sister were\r\ncompelled by him to live, prevented the rumor from reaching them, and\r\nthe circumstance of his existing marriage had been kept so strict a\r\nsecret, that it was not suspected by any but the immediate parties to\r\nthe ceremony.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Le Prun, about this time, visited the country-seat where he had\r\nplaced his wife and sister-in-law. He affected an unusual kindness\r\ntowards the former; but he had not been there a week, when she became\r\nill. A physician was called in, and appeared perplexed by the nature of\r\nher disease, which, notwithstanding his treatment, seemed to be rapidly\r\ngaining ground. As matters were in this state, one night Le Prun entered\r\nhis wife's bedroom; her sister Marie was sitting at the further side of\r\nthe bed, in the shadow of the curtains, which, as well as the unusual\r\nhour, prevented Le Prun's suspecting her presence. He looked stealthily\r\nround the room. His wife was sleeping, and with her face away from him,\r\nand a draught ordered by the physician was upon the table waiting her\r\nawaking.\r\n\r\nFrom a small vial he dropped some fluid into this, and was about to\r\nreplace it, when Marie, nerved with terror, glided swiftly to his side,\r\nsnatched the vial from his hand, and cried, in a thrilling voice--\r\n\r\n\"Emilie, awake! he is poisoning you!\"\r\n\r\nThe sleeping girl started up, and at the same moment the vial, which in\r\nher horror Marie had flung from her hand, fell beside her, on the\r\npillow. Le Prun was first confounded and speechless--then furious. He\r\nbroke the glass that contained the medicine, and pursuing the girl to\r\nthe further end of the room, seemed on the point of wreaking his fury\r\nupon her. He restrained himself, however, and having demanded the vial\r\nrepeatedly in vain, went to his own room. The next day the physician did\r\nnot attend, and in the dead of night the house was entered by thieves,\r\nsome valuables were stolen, and Mademoiselle Marie Guadin was found\r\nmurdered in her bed in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence made a great _eclat_, and suspicions, from the taint of\r\nwhich he had never quite recovered, began to environ Monsieur Le Prun.\r\nHis unhappy wife was now put under the severest restraint--from which,\r\nand, as was supposed, the partial effects of the poison, she became\r\nsubject to temporary fits of insanity. By sheer terror, Le Prun extorted\r\nfrom her a written declaration, to the effect that she lived with him\r\nmerely as his mistress, and that no marriage ceremony, or any contract\r\nof marriage, had ever been performed between them. It was about three\r\nmonths after these terrible occurrences that she gave birth to a male\r\nchild. This child, it appeared, was removed after a few weeks from its\r\nmother, and placed in the care of a poor woman in the village of\r\nCharrebourg, where, under the name of Gabriel, he, as we know, lived\r\nunrecognized, and himself unsuspecting his origin.\r\n\r\nHis mother had been a heartless, as she was a vicious and a miserable\r\nwoman. Instead of the yearnings of maternal love, she regarded her\r\ninnocent child merely as the offspring of that monster, whom she\r\nexecrated and feared with a preternatural hate. If she looked upon him\r\nwith any feeling more lively than that of indifference, it was with one\r\nof positive malice and antipathy.\r\n\r\nAmong his other employments of a delicate kind, Blassemare had charge of\r\nall arrangements affecting this person, of whom, for every reason, Le\r\nPrun hated even to hear. He paid, therefore, whatever was demanded on\r\nthis account, with the sole proviso that her name should never be\r\nmentioned. On her removal, about a year since, from the country-house\r\nwhere she had been for so long a scarcely unwilling prisoner, to the\r\nvast and melancholy Hotel St. Maurice, which had lately fallen into the\r\nhands of M. Le Prun, an accident to the carriage obliged them to arrest\r\ntheir progress for an hour at the village of Charrebourg. She was\r\nbrought into the park meanwhile, and there met with Gabriel, and\r\nsubsequently, as the reader may recollect, with Lucille. Her she had\r\narmed with the hateful relic of her husband's uncompleted crime,\r\nconscious that its exhibition would sow between her and Le Prun\r\nsuspicion, fear, and enmity enough to embitter their lives. She had at\r\nfirst intended declaring all the truth, but feared the explosion of Le\r\nPrun's fury, and doubted, too, whether the girl would believe her. The\r\nrest the reader knows.\r\n\r\nAs there was no reason to doubt Blassemare's statement, and no actual\r\nsuspicion attached to him, he was merely examined as witness.\r\n\r\nLe Prun is, we need scarcely remind the student of old French criminal\r\ncases, a celebrated name in the annals of guilt. Suspicion, by a strange\r\ncoincidence, fell upon the servant whom we have mentioned, and this man\r\nhaving been, according to the atrocious practice of the civil law, put\r\nto the torture confessed his having, at the instigation of Le Prun,\r\nmurdered the unfortunate Marie Guadin, so contriving as to make it\r\nappear that the house had been entered and plundered by thieves.\r\n\r\nA full confession, after condemnation, was extorted by the question,\r\nthat dreadful ordeal, from Le Prun, who ultimately suffered the extreme\r\npenalty of the law, as every body knows, upon the Place de Greve.\r\n\r\nThat portion of Le Prun's immense property which was not appropriated by\r\nthe crown, went, of course, to Gabriel, the peasant boy of Charrebourg.\r\nHe purchased an estate near it, and was ultimately ennobled. His\r\ngrandson, the Count de St. M----, distinguished himself in the Austrian\r\nservice, and after the Restoration, obtained a distinguished position in\r\nthe court of Louis XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe king remitted a large portion of the line in favor of Julie and of\r\nLucille. As, however, some grave suspicions were entertained by the\r\nadvisers of his majesty both as to Lucille's avowed, and, as we know,\r\n_real_ ignorance of the existence of Le Prun's first wife when she\r\nconsented to marry him, and also as to her subsequent conduct in\r\nrelation to De Secqville, the remission in her favor was coupled with a\r\ncondition that she should take the veil. This was in effect a command;\r\nand Lucille entered a convent with a cheerful acquiescence in this\r\ncondition which astonished all who knew the facts of her story.\r\n\r\nJulie, of course, on learning the pre-engagement of De Secqville's\r\naffections, and being relieved from the influence which had hitherto\r\nheld her to her involuntary engagement, demanded her freedom, and De\r\nSecqville, as may be supposed, offered no vexatious resistance to her\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nJulie, indeed, had never loved him, and consequently had little\r\ndifficulty in forgiving Lucille her treason. Inspired by the example of\r\nher companion, she proved the sincerity of those professions which so\r\nfew had believed in, by taking the veil on the same day with Lucille.\r\n\r\nThe astounding and mysterious adventure which, under these melancholy\r\ncircumstances, closed the hazardous romance of Lucille's existence,\r\nwould form in itself a story, too long, however, to be told in a single\r\npage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRY CORNWALL'S LAST SONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Proctor does not write very often now-a-days, but he has contributed\r\nseveral songs lately to the _Ladies' Companion_, which remind us of his\r\nbest performances. Here is one:--\r\n\r\n    Sit near! sit near! I kiss thy lips,\r\n      Ripe, richer than the crimson cherry.\r\n    Girl, canst thou love me in eclipse?\r\n      Tell me, and bid my soul be merry.\r\n\r\n    My light is dim, my fortune fled;\r\n      I've nothing save the love I bear thee.\r\n    Give back _thy_ love, or I am dead;--\r\n      A word--a look--whilst I can hear thee.\r\n\r\n    Sit nearer! near! I kiss thine eyes;\r\n      There,--where the white lids part asunder.\r\n    I love thee--dost thou hear my sighs?\r\n      Love thee beyond the world, thou wonder!\r\n\r\n    My life is spent. I've nothing left\r\n      To tender now, save love's soft duty;\r\n    Yet, gaze I,--of all else bereft,--\r\n      And feed till death upon thy beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Keepsake\r\n\r\nANIMA MUNDI.\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD MONCTON MILNES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Anima Mundi\"--of thyself existing,\r\n    Without diversity or change to fear,\r\n    Say, has this life to which we cling persisting,\r\n    Part in communion with thy steadfast sphere?\r\n    Does thy serene eternity sublime\r\n    Embrace the slaves of Circumstance and Time?\r\n\r\n    Could we remain continually content\r\n    To heap fresh pleasure on the coming day,\r\n    Could we rest happy in the sole intent\r\n    To make the hours more graceful or more gay,\r\n    Then must the essence of our nature be\r\n    That of the beasts that perish, not of Thee.\r\n\r\n    But if we mourn, not because time is fleeting,\r\n    Not because life is short and some die young,\r\n    But because parting ever follows meeting;\r\n    And, while our hearts with constant loss are wrung,\r\n    Our minds are tossed in doubt from sea to sea,\r\n    Then may we claim community with thee.\r\n\r\n    We cannot live by instincts--forced to let\r\n    To-morrow's wave obliterate our to-day--\r\n    See faces only once--read and forget--\r\n    Behold Truth's rays prismatically play\r\n    About our mortal eye and never shine\r\n    In one white daylight, simple and divine.\r\n\r\n    We would erect some thought the world above,\r\n    And dwell in it for ever--we make\r\n    Some moment of young Friendship or First-love\r\n    Into a dream, from which we would not wake;\r\n    We would contrast our action with repose,\r\n    Like the deep stream that widens as it flows.\r\n\r\n    We would be somewise as Thou art,\r\n    Not sprig, and bud, and flower, and fade and fall;\r\n    Not fix our intellects on some scant part\r\n    Of Nature, but enjoy or feel it all.\r\n    We would assert the privilege of a soul,\r\n    In that it knows--to understand the Whole.\r\n\r\n    If such things are within us--God is good--\r\n    And flight is destined for the callow wing,\r\n    And the high appetite implies the food,\r\n    And souls must reach the level whence they spring;\r\n    O Life of very Life! set free our Powers,\r\n    Hasten the travail of the yearning hours.\r\n\r\n    Thou! to whom old Philosophy bent low,\r\n    To the wise few mysteriously revealed;\r\n    Thou! whom each humble Christian worships now,\r\n    In the poor hamlet and the open field;\r\n    Once an Idea--new Comforter and Friend,\r\n    Hope of the human Heart! Descend! Descend!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Frazer's Magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE GHETTO OF ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church of Rome has never been famed for her tolerance; her energy\r\nand indomitable will have been too frequently manifested by the stern\r\nbehests of imperious authority. The sovereign pontiffs, with their\r\nclaims of infallibility, have left the Pagan far behind in the ardor of\r\npersecution and the more than imperial character of their governments.\r\nJulian published edicts of universal toleration; from time to time he\r\nassumed the garb of each different sect, and claimed affinity with the\r\ngods of each conquered race. At one moment the zealous supporter of\r\nChristianity, then the ablest advocate of the Platonic philosophy: at\r\nanother, initiated into all the arcana of the Theurgic science and the\r\nEleusinian mysteries, terminating his checkered religious career by that\r\ngreat edict of universal toleration which astonished the whole Roman\r\nworld, when all classes of all religions, Pagan and Christian, received\r\nalike an express command to open the portals of their temples. Paganism\r\ncould afford to be tolerant, not so Christianity. One god, more or less,\r\nin the Heathen Pantheon makes very little difference, but the worship of\r\nthe Christian Church is one and exclusive. The very ardor of its belief\r\nrenders it essentially intolerant. How is it possible to be indulgent to\r\nerror, when we are firmly persuaded that such error must lead to eternal\r\ncondemnation? But whatever apology may be made for intolerance by those\r\nwho do not suffer from its severities, it will not be approved of by the\r\nthousands who find themselves deprived of their most prized social\r\nrights for the sake of their faith. None suffer more from this Christian\r\nspirit than the favored and exclusive race in Rome. While other nations\r\nhave been constantly relieving the Jews from the pains and penalties\r\nwhich have been attached to their absence of faith, the Church of Rome\r\nhas stood over them stern, proud, and uncompromising. To be a Jew in the\r\nHoly City, is at once to be deprived of half the social privileges of\r\ncitizenship. Among other grievances under which they suffer, they are\r\nconfined to a small district of the town called the Ghetto, where\r\nformerly the gates were locked from sunset to sunrise, during which\r\nperiod no one was permitted to pass out; on the slightest pretences they\r\nused to be persecuted for any the least expression of irritation into\r\nwhich they may have been betrayed: the poor people bear impressed on\r\ntheir countenances the downcast dogged look of persecution. Confined to\r\nsuch a small space, they have crowded their houses together until, in\r\nsome of the streets, or rather lanes, it is easy to step across from one\r\nroof to another. The dark eye, the luxurious black hair, and a sensual\r\nexpression produced by a fulness of the lower lip are the\r\ncharacteristics of the women. Long, dirty, scanty beards--thin, lank,\r\ngray hair--frames which have grown decrepit through long\r\npersecution--eyes piercing and crafty--sickly, wrinkled features, are\r\nthe characteristics of the men. Although, as I have remarked, the gates\r\nand the pales of the Ghetto are now removed, a stranger can easily tell\r\nwhen he enters what Catholic Rome considers its tainted circle, by the\r\nmiserable, poverty-stricken appearance of the whole district. The people\r\ncrowd around him, losing all sense of manly dignity or mental\r\ndegradation in the anxiety for gain. Skinny shrivelled hands touch his\r\nclothes in the hope of arresting his progress; worn-out tawdry finery is\r\nthrust before him, in the hope of tempting him to purchase. No shop, or\r\nrather store, is devoted to any particular object of gain. Butter,\r\ndates, olives, broken and pawned articles, are mixed up in the most\r\nabsurd confusion. With brocaded coats, valuable lace, and Eastern silks,\r\nJewish trade resembles the Jewish character and the Jewish faith,--much\r\nthat is low, mean, and sordid, combined with some elements of the\r\nbeautiful, the prized, and the good.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this strange, fantastic, rococo district, if beyond the pale of\r\nChristianity, is far from being without the pale of fashion. Ladies,\r\nexhibiting the height of Parisian fashions, with dainty footsteps and\r\nsoft movement, may be seen of an afternoon endeavoring to thread their\r\nway through the greasy throng, which jostle, elbow, and abuse each other\r\nin these narrow lanes. The cunning Israelites must have scouts to tell\r\nthem whenever any particular connoisseur is approaching; for, strange\r\nenough, the article which each is in search of is precisely that which\r\nis displayed in all the shops. If the lady come to purchase lace, the\r\nmost valuable specimens of the _pointe du roi_ are forced upon her; if\r\nshe require silks, by the strangest magnetism the finest dyes and\r\nrichest fabrics are unrolled as she draws near. From the constant and\r\ninvaluable habit of concealing their own impressions, the Jews appear to\r\nbe better enabled to read the sensations of others. They know, almost to\r\na nicety, the extent of their customers' means and intentions. Go\r\ndisguised as you choose, they will discover you. The Jewish origin,\r\ngrafted on the Roman craft, has produced a progeny which would astonish\r\nthe adroitness of our own peculiar tribe of Levis and Fagans.\r\n\r\nI had, on two or three different occasions, visited the Ghetto in search\r\nof old lace, and on each occasion had turned to admire perhaps one of\r\nthe most beautiful faces which could at that time have been found in\r\nRome. It was that of a young Jewish girl, who was always sitting at the\r\nsame corner of the street at the entrance of the Ghetto, where she kept\r\na fruit-stall.\r\n\r\nHers was one of those faces in which the features, from their strongly\r\nmarked development, become at once impressed upon the memory. She was\r\ntall, of a commanding appearance, her cheek was very pale, but lit up by\r\nthe blackest eyes. She wore a thick Indian-striped handkerchief, tied\r\ncunningly round her head; and a large pair of massive gold ear-rings,\r\nwhich fell almost to her neck. Even if plain, she would have been most\r\nremarkable, from the perfect indifference which she evinced as to\r\nwhether she sold her goods or not. While all the rest of her tribe were\r\nfawning, cringing, flattering, and importuning, she sat there like a\r\nstatue, but a statue of a most perfect order. Nor was this indifference\r\nand apathy of her manner thrown away on the purchasers who crowded\r\ntowards the Ghetto. It stood her in better stead than the most manifest\r\nanxiety could have done; it placed her apart from that detestable crowd.\r\nI observed many persons stop and make purchases of her on whom all\r\nimportunity would have been thrown away. There was not one of the buyers\r\nwho did not look back with hurried gaze at that pale and glorious face,\r\nwhich did not even glow with the least tinge of animation at the\r\nadmiration which she excited. She sold her stock in trade, changed her\r\nmoney, with the same entire absence of interest in her occupation.\r\nCarriages turning the corner suddenly where her fruit-stall was placed,\r\nsometimes almost grazed it and overthrew all its contents; but even this\r\ncircumstance did not appear to awaken any interest in her mind; she only\r\nstooped down to pick up one or two of the peaches which had been shaken\r\noff by the jar, quietly moved her stall a little nearer the wall, and\r\nthen folded her arms again in the same contemptuous manner.\r\n\r\nStrange, indeed, but it ever is so; the world cares most for those who\r\nappear to treat it with contempt and to be indifferent to its petty\r\ninterests. Be a slave to the world, and it will impose the heaviest\r\nburdens upon you; it will be the hardest of all taskmasters; but, on the\r\nother hand, drive it before you, and it will obey almost every impulse\r\nof the determined. In this country, where individualism and idiosyncracy\r\nare now so rare, the very deference which the whole of constituted\r\nsociety pays to the requirements of the majority, only renders the\r\nexceptional case more rare and prized. We unconsciously admire those\r\nwho, instead of seeking to be guided by the opinions of others, endeavor\r\nto direct them, and who, forming their own standard of judgment, keep\r\nthemselves aloof from all fluctuations of indecision and weakness.\r\n\r\nI had been commissioned to purchase two flounces of the handsomest lace,\r\nand had made two unsuccessful expeditions to the Ghetto in search of it,\r\nransacking all the shops and listening to an immeasurable amount of\r\nfalsehood; but as I was soon to leave Rome, I did not wish to do so with\r\nmy commission unfulfilled, and resolved to make another search: besides,\r\nthat beautiful pale statuette deeply interested me, without ever having\r\naddressed a single word to her. I felt well assured that her mind must\r\nbe one of no ordinary stamp. One day I stopped near her for some time,\r\nwithout attracting her observation, and then it was that I so greatly\r\nadmired and marvelled at the total absence of the two qualifications for\r\nwhich her nation are remarkable--cunning and obtrusiveness.\r\n\r\nI reached the stall, and turned after I had passed it a little way to\r\ntake a passing glance at her. To my astonishment, and almost sorrow, I\r\nobserved that her cheeks, and even her figure, had lost their admirable\r\nfulness: there was a strange and wild expression in her eye. I turned\r\nback involuntarily and stood for a moment opposite her stall. She\r\nbeckoned me towards her.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you want,\" she said, with a rapid utterance, as if anxious\r\nto get rid of the subject; \"you want to purchase some lace. I have a\r\npiece which I am sure will suit you, and you shall have it very cheap.\r\nIt belonged to--.\" Here she hesitated, looked down, and, as I fixed my\r\neye on her countenance for the first time, the blood rose to the very\r\ntemples, and she appeared lovely. \"No matter who it belonged to; some\r\ngreat man, of course; but I have the lace, that is sufficient for you to\r\nknow. Tell me what sum you are willing to give, and then I shall know\r\nwhether mine is too expensive.\"\r\n\r\nI named the amount which I was desired to lay out for the finest quality\r\nof old lace. It was, I knew, a small sum for such an object, unless in\r\nthe case of some fortunate hit; but to my surprise she told me that her\r\npiece of lace was much within that mark; and then I began to imagine\r\nthat it must be of inferior quality, but she assured me of the contrary.\r\n\r\nShe commissioned a boy to keep her stall for her for a few minutes, and\r\nthen walked on at a rapid pace, desiring me to follow her.\r\n\r\nIt was not until she rose from her seat that I had an opportunity of\r\nobserving the beautiful symmetry of her figure. Her footstep was firm,\r\nlike that of one who possesses a strong will. To have seen her as she\r\nswept along the streets, you would have imagined that she was on a\r\nmission, in which high resolve and great self-sacrifices were required,\r\nso compressed was the lip and haughty the glance,--\r\n\r\n        Moving through the throng,\r\n    Like one who does, not suffers wrong.\r\n\r\nNo one would have imagined that it was the question of the sale of a\r\npiece of lace as she passed down the streets, with the folds of her\r\ndress almost sweeping the ground; while, with a scarf of beautiful\r\ntexture fastened round her waist, she resembled one of those maidens of\r\nthe sun which we see in Egyptian frescoes.\r\n\r\n\"Let me pass, Emmanuel,\" she said to a broken-backed, stunted broker,\r\nwho was hanging some filthy rags on a string which stretched across a\r\nnarrow lane.\r\n\r\n\"Pass! so you shall, my love, my own bright eyes: but you shall give me\r\na kiss first,\" said the cadaverous-looking wretch; and he put his thin,\r\nbleared, and hairy lips near her face; but in the act he turned his head\r\nhalf round, and, for the first time, he saw me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I ask your pardon, Rachel!\" he said; \"the Christian, of course,\r\nbefore one of our own tribe. I know you well, my darling, you never\r\ndeceived me in your brightest days. You are a great lady; but, after\r\nall, we are both more or less in the same line. I sell old clothes, you\r\nsell old kisses; the difference is, that I cannot get rid of my wares as\r\nfast as you can of your kisses.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly she turned round in all her beauty; flushed with indignation\r\nand trembling with anger, contempt, bitterness, and hatred, could not\r\nhave been more gloriously expressed. The sallow, sickly, hollow-eyed\r\nimpertinent was looking up at her face when, with one push, she hurled\r\nhim over a heap of rubbish, which in the centre of the street supplied\r\nthe place of a gutter; and shouts of laughter saluted him as he slunk,\r\ndowncast and defeated, back into his shop.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked at him, I observed that his eyes, which before had only\r\nexpressed lust and sordid avarice, now gleamed wildly with a look of\r\nintense and bitter hatred.\r\n\r\nThere are none whom we are so disposed to punish as the mean and sordid,\r\nand yet there are none whom it is more dangerous to offend; they feel,\r\nwith tenfold virulence, the disgust which they engender; they go about\r\nbearing with them a curse, which they are ever ready to transfer to any\r\nwho offend them. No man is ignorant of his possessing the lower\r\nqualities; and no one, not even he who suffers from their action, can so\r\nintensely hate and despise them as their possessor. They are the chains\r\non the galley-slaves, which clank at every step, but which they cannot\r\nshake off, allowing them only that amount of liberty of action which\r\nincessantly recalls their restraint.\r\n\r\nMy guide turned sharp round to the left, and the next moment we were at\r\nthe foot of the broken stair. Two or three dogs, which as usual had\r\ntaken possession of the small space allotted for the passage to the\r\nprimo piano, rushed, with frantic yells, down stairs. It could scarcely\r\nbe properly called a house; it was rather a collection of planks nailed\r\ntogether, supporting the most rickety description of roof. It was quite\r\nwonderful how the whole fabric held together at all; for between the\r\nchinks of the rotten and creaking floor we could look into the shop\r\nbelow, where, amid immense piles of bales and casks, children were\r\nriotously playing.\r\n\r\nThere was a curious expression of doubt and uneasiness in Rachel's\r\ncountenance, when, with some slight degree of impatience, I begged her\r\nto be quick and show me the lace. She looked carefully round the room,\r\nas though fearful of being observed. At last, after some hesitation, she\r\nransacked an old drawer, and drew forth the lace from beneath a heap of\r\nrags and rubbish.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly the most magnificent specimen of old lace which I had\r\nseen in Italy. A large and deep flounce of the _pointe du roi_; that\r\nlace which was made solely for the Grand Monarque, and subsequently sold\r\nat immense prices, a great portion of it coming into the possession of\r\nthe cardinals. It was in a most perfect state, and the only thing that\r\nsurprised me in the transaction was the excessively low price which she\r\nasked for it: but, of course, it was not my business to tell her the\r\nreal value of her own property; so I eagerly wrote a check on Torlonia,\r\nand requested her to pack it up.\r\n\r\nMy attention had latterly been so absorbed by the beauty of the fabric,\r\nthat it was not until I placed the check in her hand I observed how she\r\ntrembled. She endeavored, when she saw me observing her, to conceal her\r\nagitation, but it soon defied even her dissimulation. She leant against\r\na small chest of drawers, and had barely strength enough to point to a\r\ncup, which was half full of spirits, which I handed to her. She drank it\r\noff with the energy of apparent despair, and then it was that she\r\ncommenced to revive slowly; but her forehead was still damp from\r\nagitation, and her lips were as pale and colorless as her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked. \"Are you ill, Rachel?\"\r\n\r\nShe clutched hold of my arm mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"Do not show the lace,\" she exclaimed, \"to any one in Rome; at least\r\npromise me solemnly that you will not allow a single person to know from\r\nwhom you purchased it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you like,\" I answered, \"but you ought, on the contrary, to be\r\nvery proud of having such a beautiful piece in your possession. I should\r\nhave thought that you would have wished me to tell every one of my\r\nfriends, so as to extend the reputation of your shop; but, of course, I\r\nwill do as you like, and lock it up until I leave Rome.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed greatly relieved by this assurance; it must have restored or\r\nconfirmed her confidence in me, for after a long pause she said,--\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you the truth, for you are a friend. You saw that man,\" she\r\ncontinued; \"that miserable wretch, Emmanuel? Well, although I treated\r\nhim in so bold and harsh a manner, I must tell you that I am at heart\r\nbitterly afraid of him. He is at once a coward to the strong, and a\r\ntyrant to the weak; one of those despicable characters which get our\r\nnation unjustly aspersed. He really does possess all those vices and\r\nmeannesses which are attributed to many who are as noble, true, and good\r\nas you of the Christian race. You will consider me as unmerciful as my\r\nfaith, from the manner in which I speak of this abandoned villain; but\r\nthe truth is, that I am in the power of a guardian, who, if he knew that\r\nI had this money, would be the first to take it from me; and Emmanuel,\r\nwho finds every thing out, will be certain to inform him. You saw the\r\nlook he gave when I pushed the foul creature from me. I know that he is\r\nonly waiting his opportunity to be revenged upon me. He had the\r\ninsolence to ask me to marry him two years since; and upon my refusing\r\nto accept him, he swore that his hatred should some day or another find\r\nme out; so I quite tremble when I see him, however bold I may pretend to\r\nbe. But, oh, my heart! Hush! he is standing there below.\"\r\n\r\nShe knelt down on the floor, and touched me gently to make me draw back\r\nso as not to be seen by him; but it was too late, he had caught a\r\nglimpse of her through the crevices of the floor. He did not attempt to\r\ncome up the stair, but he stood at the foot of it, heaping upon her the\r\ncoarsest and most brutal expressions. For a moment, all the fear that\r\nhad shortly before marked her countenance had given way to the most\r\nintense hatred. It flashed from her eyes and dilated her nostrils. My\r\nfirst impulse was to rush forward and turn the man out of the shop; but\r\nthe girl saw the movement, and placed her hand on my arm with a\r\nsignificant look. The color had left her cheeks, and she was again pale\r\nas star-light.\r\n\r\nWe waited there some minutes, when Emmanuel, after muttering sundry\r\ncurses, withdrew. We looked at him as he passed down the lane, with his\r\nhands clenched and the muscles of his countenance trembling with\r\nexcitement. We heard him, as he passed by, telling every one of his\r\nfriends that Rachel was shut up in the room with a Christian. Some\r\ntreated the information with indifference, others only called him\r\njealous; but sundry boys crowded round the door, waiting for my\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nI took the lace and left the shop with her. The children in the street,\r\nexcited by that rascal, made use of some insulting expressions towards\r\nher; but ran away whenever I made an attempt to approach them. I could,\r\nhowever, see that the poor girl was, if not alarmed, very unhappy; for,\r\nnow that Emmanuel was no longer present, the tears ran down her cheeks.\r\nI took her hand kindly and parted from her, but not without a vague and\r\nuncomfortable feeling of doubt and mistrust.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, me!\" I thought, when alone, \"is this the freedom, the liberty, the\r\ncharity which suffereth long, the consideration for others, which the\r\ngospel teaches? It is well for the great poet to write of the freedom of\r\nthe Roman citizen:--\r\n\r\n    But Rome, 'tis thine alone, with awful sway,\r\n    To rule mankind, and make the world obey;\r\n    Disposing peace and war, thine own majestic sway.\r\n    To tame the proud, the fettered slave to free:\r\n    These are imperial acts, and worthy thee.\r\n\r\nThe fettered slave is set free, but the citizen is enthralled; not\r\nbecause he now proclaims another king than Caesar, but simply because the\r\ntenets of his faith are not precisely the same as our own. And this\r\nbeautiful girl, brought up in that worst of suffering--mental\r\nsuffering--keenly feeling the persecution to which her race is exposed,\r\nhowever, she could bear children who would, in those moments of\r\ntribulation to which Imperial Rome of all empires is most subject, stand\r\nforth to defend her walls!\"\r\n\r\nI went away, however, well pleased with my purchase. Notwithstanding my\r\npromise to the contrary, I could not avoid showing it to one or two\r\nparticular friends. Even in so slight a matter it is very easy to find\r\nfood for vanity. It gratified me to have purchased it so cheaply. When\r\nit was pronounced quite beautiful, I accepted the expression as an\r\nindirect tribute to my judgment, taste, and ability. It was, of course,\r\nnot the lace that I cared for, although most anxious to gratify her who\r\nhad charged me with the commission. What, to judge myself truly, I\r\ndelighted in, was the circumstance of my having gained a victory over\r\nthose who possess hereditary claims for depth and cunning.\r\n\r\nAh, it does not do to cast the lead too frequently into the depths of\r\nthe heart in search of motives.\r\n\r\nI was at dinner the same day when a card was sent in to me; it had the\r\nname of M. Narelli, the head of the police, printed upon it. I was at a\r\nloss to imagine what business he could have with me; but as my servant\r\ntold me that it was a matter of the last moment, with some misgivings I\r\ndesired that he might be shown in. The moment he appeared, I could\r\ndetect at one glance that he was a man of official eminence, and also of\r\ngreat ability. The eye always catches the resolution or indecision of\r\nthe mind. To judge from his expression, he must have been a man of the\r\ncoolest courage and most determined character. His manner was\r\ndeferential, without being obsequious; his voice, clear, sonorous, and\r\ndistinct, rang on the ear like a well-toned bell.\r\n\r\nHe commenced by apologizing for the intrusion, and then at once asked me\r\nwhether it was true that I had that morning purchased some lace of a\r\nyoung Jewish girl in the Ghetto.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he uttered the word lace, than the whole tragedy burst\r\nupon me. I remembered Rachel's hesitation, her fears, her tremblings,\r\nand excitement: all was explained. For one moment I felt tempted to deny\r\nthe whole transaction, and to refuse to show the lace: a second\r\nconsideration, however, proved to me that it would be at once absurd and\r\nunjustifiable: but that moment showed me the poor girl, pale,\r\nbroken-hearted, and trembling under the weight of a terrible accusation.\r\nI bitterly lamented the innocent part which I had taken in this\r\ntransaction, and regretted that I had ever visited the Ghetto in search\r\nof lace. I thought of her as I first saw her standing at the\r\nfruit-stall, with that haughty, contemptuous glance, that resolute and\r\nopen countenance; and it was bitter to picture her sinking in jail, in\r\nsuch a prison as Italy boasts of in these enlightened days: but there\r\nwas not much time for reflection and consideration. M. Narelli, who saw\r\nthat I was hesitating, told me at once that the whole truth was known,\r\nand that he must require the piece of lace to be given over to him; he\r\nthen suggested that it would be a kindness to the woman herself if I\r\nwould accompany him at once to St. Angelo, to be confronted with her.\r\n\r\nAs we drove rapidly down the streets, he told me that the lace had been\r\nstolen some months since from one of the cardinals. The police had\r\nsuspected for a long time that it was concealed somewhere in the Ghetto;\r\nbut in consequence of the hostile feeling which had been apparent there\r\nfor many months, they did not like to commence an official search in\r\nthat district without sufficient evidence; this evidence had been\r\nobtained that very day through one of those ill-conditioned, ill-omened\r\nspies, who are to be found connected with the police of every country.\r\nFrom the description which he gave of the man, I could not for a moment\r\ndoubt that it was Emmanuel. He told me very frankly the precise hour at\r\nwhich the informer came to him, and I found that it was soon after I had\r\nleft the shop.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight stoppage caused by the carriages which were driving\r\nup to the Teatro d'Apolion, the present Opera. People looked curiously\r\ninto ours, which was well-known as that of the chief of the police. How\r\nwonderful are the circles into which the interests of society are\r\ndivided; how many currents are eddying and bubbling in their course\r\nbefore the mighty river of human existence is formed; each stream so\r\nperfect in itself, so separate from every other, yet ever flowing\r\ntowards the same wide fathomless sea. Of the gay and the happy whom I\r\npassed, how few cared for this poor girl, or how few would have cared\r\nhad they even heard the tale! I felt myself almost criminal from the\r\ncircumstance of having been the cause of this misery to another. My\r\nwhole thoughts were fixed on this one object. Before the fulness of my\r\nimagination the prison-walls disappeared, and I saw nothing but the\r\ncells, and listened to the voices of the many to whom the voice of the\r\ncomforter is never heard. We were passing over the yellow Tiber, but I\r\nheeded not its associations, either with history or with my early\r\nschoolboy days, their studies and their struggles. When the mind is full\r\nof one object, all others become invisible, even to the senses. The\r\nlight of the mind is greater than the light of the body.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at last at the gates of St. Angelo, the tomb of the dead\r\nPagan and of the living Christian. After certain stern, painful\r\nformalities were gone through, in the most matter-of-fact way, between\r\nmy companion and the commander of the strong post which was on guard, we\r\nentered the mighty precincts, and the gates closed behind us. I had then\r\ntime to marvel at the massiveness of the structure--the immense blocks\r\nof stone, so typical of the colossal empire under which it was\r\nconstructed. Passing through a long series of narrow passages, gloomy\r\nand sad, impervious to all sound, save that of low sighs and groans from\r\ndungeons below and around us, we arrived at an open space in the centre,\r\nabove which the winged angel is poised in the act of sheathing his\r\nsword. The moon shone around it, and the expanded wings, edged with a\r\nsilvery light, seemed almost to move in the light breeze: there were\r\nguards on the battlements, who marched with solemn, measured tread; and\r\nhigh above all floated the Pontifical banner, with the keys of St. Peter\r\nin its huge folds flapping in the breeze,--the emblem of sovereignty,\r\nspiritual and temporal. No one can judge of the immense extent of St.\r\nAngelo from the interior. The ashes of the great Emperor, how small a\r\nspace could they have occupied in that vast circumference--the tomb of\r\nthe one day, the citadel of the morrow--the grave of the Pagan, the\r\nfortress of Christianity! During the recent revolution at Rome the\r\npeople broke down the viaduct which connects it with the Vatican, and\r\nthe ruined wall still remains;--we may hope, as a good omen, to show\r\nthat the palace and the prison are no longer closely connected together,\r\nand that safety does not depend on the battlements and armaments of that\r\nstern old tower of other days, which stands surrounded with the\r\nmemorials and memories of imperial Rome.\r\n\r\nIn one of the darkest of these cells the poor girl had been thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was opened gently, we saw what seemed to be a heap of\r\nclothes piled together in one corner; but the light from a small lamp\r\nsuspended from the ceiling was so weak that it was quite impossible to\r\ndistinguish any object distinctly. The cell, as far as I could judge\r\nfrom a hasty glance, resembled those abodes of misery which have been so\r\nfrequently described, and which it would require the energies of ten\r\nHowards to improve. There was a disagreeable, close, damp smell; the\r\npavement of the floor was sadly out of repair; there was a bracket\r\nplaced against the wall, with a few necessary articles of furniture for\r\nordinary use; but when my eyes became more accustomed to the light, I\r\ndiscovered that what had appeared a mere heap of clothes was the poor\r\ngirl, almost rolled up in the corner. For some moments she continued to\r\nlie there, apparently quite insensible; but at last, with a sharp cry,\r\nshe raised her head suddenly, and then I could not mistake the beautiful\r\ncountenance that had so struck me on that morning. But, sad to say, even\r\nthese few hours had made great ravages: sorrow, anxiety, and misery are\r\nthe most zealous accessories of age. She really looked years older: this\r\nmight have been partly the effect of the lurid, flickering light, and\r\nthe disorder of her dress; but sure I am that no one could have\r\nrecognized the haughty, dignified, imposing woman, who but a few hours\r\nsince had swept almost contemptuously through the streets.\r\n\r\n\"You are come to accuse me,\" she exclaimed, falling with both her hands\r\non the pavement, and striking it with violence; \"now you come to accuse\r\nme. It is like a Christian,\" she continued, with increased bitterness in\r\nher voice and vehemence in her action. And then she sobbed violently,\r\nand looked into my face with a piteous expression.\r\n\r\nThe police prevented the necessity of my reply, for one of the men\r\nseized her at once by the arm, and dragged her up rudely, desiring her\r\nto stand. And she did stand there--a picture of utter prostration,\r\nmental and physical, to have melted any heart, save the stony, arid ones\r\nof those men who were with me. Stand alone she could not, but she leaned\r\nagainst the wall, and her head fell on her shoulder, her fingers were\r\nintertwined together, and she moved them about with a kind of galvanic\r\nagitation. All the anger and impetuosity of her character had passed\r\naway: she was no longer the ideal of ruined greatness, but the simple,\r\nbroken-hearted woman. Violence in a woman is at all times so painful to\r\nwitness, even in moments of extreme sorrow, that it rather offends than\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\"You know this woman?\" said the abrupt, uncouth examiner, in a voice\r\nwhich echoed to the vaulted roof.\r\n\r\nI scarcely dared look at her; but I felt that those large black eyes\r\nwere fixed supplicatingly upon me, and I, too, trembled.\r\n\r\nThe question was repeated in the same harsh manner, and this time I\r\nnodded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"She sold you this piece of lace?\" was the next question.\r\n\r\nHe took the lace of exquisite texture, and unrolled it so roughly that\r\nit tore in his hand. M. Narelli had left us for some minutes, or this\r\nmiserable subordinate would not have dared to behave in so rude a\r\nmanner; but I scarcely thought it worth while to notice it,--or rather,\r\nI scarcely did notice it at the time, my attention was so absorbed by\r\nthe poor girl, whose happiness, whose every prospect, depended on my\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nI could not but repeat the affirmation; but how strange a thing is\r\njustice, that it is sometimes difficult to reconcile it to humanity,\r\ngenerosity, and all the nobler qualities of the heart! At the moment\r\nthat I was telling the truth my heart, and almost my conscience,\r\nreproached me; it was impossible for me to deny the fact; even had it\r\nbeen possible by a denial to have destroyed all the links of evidence,\r\ncould I so violate every received principle? But, nevertheless, however\r\nirreconcilable with honor, dignity, and religion such a course would\r\nhave been, the features of that poor girl have frequently since appeared\r\nto me wearing such a reproachful glance, that I have seemed to stand\r\nbefore her abashed and self-convicted.\r\n\r\n\"And this piece of lace you stole?\" continued the inquisitor, turning\r\nsharply to Rachel,--a style of examination which would scarcely be\r\nunderstood in England.\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, but looked at him with a calm, steady glance. Then a\r\nsudden thought seemed to strike her.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you but one favor,\" she said, speaking to M. Narelli, who had\r\njust returned. \"Order these men away, and leave me alone for ten minutes\r\nwith this gentleman: if you mistrust me, you will, at least, have\r\nconfidence in an English gentleman. Besides, what chance is there of my\r\nescaping from this place?\" And she cast a melancholy glance around the\r\ncell. \"You can watch at the door, if you choose,\" she continued, with\r\nadditional animation; \"do this, and I will give him some most important\r\ninformation; if you remain, I will tell nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe men whispered together, and appeared to hesitate about granting her\r\nrequest. I looked on in great anxiety. I was most desirous of being of\r\nsome use to the poor girl, more especially as I felt myself to have been\r\nthe innocent, but still the original cause, of all her sufferings.\r\n\r\n\"Do this,\" she continued, with a heightened tone,--\"do this, and I will\r\ntell you much more: I will put you upon the track of a man who has\r\nstolen countless wealth--who has done worse than steal, who has stained\r\nhis hands with blood. You know Flavio. Well, I know him also; and at the\r\npresent moment I can tell you where he is to be found. Do you believe me\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\nFlavio had been well known some two years previously as one of those\r\nbandits who was the terror of a whole province. He was accused of\r\nseveral daring crimes, and a few months before these events a person had\r\nbeen murdered in one of the narrow streets which skirt the city, and\r\nthe strongest circumstantial evidence pointed him out as the criminal.\r\nSince then the police had been vigorously on the alert to discover his\r\nhiding-place, but all their efforts up to this period had been\r\nfruitless. I had often heard him spoken of, more especially in\r\nconnection with the republican movement then in progress in Italy; but I\r\nwas quite at a loss to imagine what connection could have subsisted\r\nbetween this man and Rachel, or where she had had the opportunity of\r\nseeing him.\r\n\r\nThe men left the cell, M. Narelli whispering me to curtail the interview\r\nas much as possible, as they were anxious to terminate the first\r\ninquiry. So soon as the door was closed, she threw herself at my feet,\r\ntook from her bosom a small packet, which I opened, and there I saw the\r\npicture of a fair child--she might have been seven years of age; and\r\npacked up with the picture was a lock of hair, and an address.\r\n\r\n\"As you are the cause of my misery,\" she said, \"be also the source of my\r\nhappiness, even in this infliction. Give this to my child at the\r\ninclosed address, and tell her to love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your child!\" I exclaimed, with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"My child, and by a man who you heard me mention so recently--Flavio!\"\r\n\r\n\"And Flavio?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I shall denounce him,\" she exclaimed,--\"denounce him, as the one great\r\nduty which I owe to society, as an atonement for my own sins. And does\r\nhe not deserve it? Is it but a light thing for a man to ruin me, in the\r\nfirst instance,--to leave me afterwards to starve, and compel me to keep\r\na fruit-stall to gain the shadow of a subsistence,--condemning me to\r\nmisery and to humiliations which my soul abhorred and loathed? And was\r\nthat all? I said that you were the cause of my being here in this\r\nwretched dungeon; you are the innocent cause, but the man who betrayed\r\nme was----\"\r\n\r\n\"Was Emmanuel,\" I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Emmanuel, it is true,\" she continued; \"but there was a traitor\r\nprior to him, and greater than him; it was Flavio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flavio?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is scarcely credible, but true. He insisted upon my giving him all\r\nmy earnings; when I refused to do so,--not for my own sake, for I could\r\nlive just as happily on bread-and-water as you could surrounded by all\r\nyour luxuries, but for the sake of my child, who, at that time, was\r\nalmost starving, for I had to bestow all the pittance I could scrape\r\ntogether to procure it a nurse and a lodging. It was Flavio induced me\r\nto steal the lace. I did so in a moment of desperation, when I fully\r\nbelieved he would have murdered me if I had refused to obey him. I had\r\nit by me so long; for, in the first instance, I did not venture to offer\r\nit for sale; and latterly, I thought it would be difficult to procure\r\nthe full price. At last I heard that you were searching for old lace,\r\nand thought I was safe in your hands. Circumstances have turned out\r\ndifferently. I sent to Flavio to tell him that I had found a customer\r\nfor it, and till the very moment I was arrested I was perfectly ignorant\r\nthat he and that scoundrel Emmanuel were in close communion together;\r\nbut when I was dragged out of my small, miserable lodging, like a\r\ncondemned criminal, rather than as a person only accused of a crime,\r\nEmmanuel, who stood by, with a glow of triumph over his pale, miserable,\r\nwithered countenance, whispered to me, 'Thank Flavio for this; he\r\ndenounced you for the reward.'\"\r\n\r\n\"He will escape you,\" I said; \"of course he will imagine that you intend\r\nto be revenged upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not escape me long, for I know that he imagines me ignorant of\r\nthe woman with whom he is now living, and who hates him with a\r\nbitterness second only to my own. She will give him up to justice, and\r\ndeservedly so. A greater villain does not exist. I cannot tell you what\r\nhis whole conduct has been to me--his acts of barbarous cruelty. Even my\r\nchild, whom I dote on, cannot make me forgive the father all his\r\niniquity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this poor child?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is the thought that lays next my heart with a weight which I\r\ncan scarce sustain!\" And she clasped her hands to her bosom, as though\r\nto express the greatness of her affliction. \"What I ask you is to see\r\nthe child, to give her this lock of hair and likeness. And may I venture\r\none thing more,--may I ask you to take care that she is not left utterly\r\ndestitute?\" And so saying, she put a small purse in my hand, saying, \"It\r\nis very light, but it contains all that I possess.\"\r\n\r\nI returned her the purse, as she required every baiocchi to add to her\r\ncomforts in the prison; but I set her mind at rest by promising to see\r\nher child the next morning, and to do all that lay in my power for its\r\nsupport and protection.\r\n\r\nShe fell at my feet, bathing my hands with her tears. In her beauty, as\r\nshe knelt before me, I for the moment forgot in what spot we were\r\nstanding, and looked upon her with an interest which was only broken,\r\nrudely enough, by the clanging of the chains of the door, and its\r\ncreaking movement on its rusty hinges. M. Narelli entered, and with the\r\nrough, straightforward, practical conduct of a man in his position, he\r\ncame at once to the point.\r\n\r\n\"You confess, then, that you stole the lace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" she answered, with a firm voice, which surprised me after the\r\nscene I had just witnessed; \"I do confess that I stole the lace; but it\r\nwas not for myself, but for one far greater, and far better capable of\r\nmaking a defence--for that man Flavio.\"\r\n\r\nI noticed the gleam of satisfaction that passed over M. Narelli's\r\ncountenance at the mention of his name; and when he felt well assured\r\nthat he was, at last, fairly on the track of the man who had evaded all\r\nhis efforts, and in pursuit of whom, as I afterwards learned, he was, on\r\none occasion, nearly losing his situation, on account of a robbery\r\nwhich it was quite evident that Flavio had committed, but of which he\r\ncould not obtain the least trace, at once his whole manner changed\r\ntowards the unfortunate girl; he asked her to sit down, to be quite\r\ncalm, and to tell him all that she knew of the man's career.\r\n\r\nI thought, for one moment, that even then she would have relented, but\r\nit was far otherwise; she began at once, with the calmest voice, to give\r\na sketch of Flavio's life from the time when she first met him. The\r\nstory was one of intense interest. It seems that at one time he was\r\nengaged in gaining an honest livelihood; but one unlucky day he\r\nquarrelled with a man--struck him; this led to a tussle, and, in a fit\r\nof exasperation, he took out a knife and killed him on the spot. From\r\nthat moment he was lost. The dead man's family vowed vengeance against\r\nhim. He had to take to the woods, where, for self-defence, and really\r\nfor his subsistence, he took to the brigand's life. His extreme courage,\r\nand even generosity, soon brought a large number of followers together;\r\nand, as I have already remarked, he became the terror of the whole\r\nNeapolitan frontier. At one time two or three regiments were sent in\r\npursuit of him; and then it was he undertook the last and boldest step\r\nof coming to Rome itself. He got into the city at night, and for a long\r\ntime nothing more was heard of Flavio. At last his old habits returned.\r\nSome robberies committed with wondrous skill, and a murder of\r\nextraordinary atrocity, made the police suspect that the man who thus\r\nbraved their vigilance was a criminal of no ordinary description; but do\r\nwhat they would, they were baffled in every scheme which they planned\r\nfor his arrest. At one moment his extraordinary nerve saved him,--for\r\ninstance, when chased by the police, he sought shelter in one of the\r\nvery tribunals, which they might naturally imagine was about the last\r\nplace where he would have been found. Mingled with this wild and savage\r\ncharacter were some generous qualities; he had been known to assist\r\npeople in misfortune, and a vague kind of interest attached to him on\r\naccount of traits of self-denial that were attributed to him. But now,\r\nwhen Rachel told me of his heartless conduct to her, I learned how\r\nentirely visionary are all those tales of nobility of character among\r\nmen who are leading an abandoned and vicious life.\r\n\r\nFrom her story it could not be doubted for a moment that he it was who\r\nhad instigated her to commit the act which had brought her to despair.\r\nNothing could equal the bitterness with which she inveighed against him.\r\nShe told all his hiding-places--the secret passages by which he evaded\r\nall pursuit; and when the story was finished, and her vengeance\r\naccomplished, she wept like a child.\r\n\r\nEven the stern M. Narelli was touched at the painful tale. He gave\r\norders that every comfort should be shown her, and after some minutes\r\nfurther delay, we left the prison.\r\n\r\nWe had been there almost three hours, but the time had seemed very\r\nshort. When we crossed the Ponte St. Angelo the people were leaving the\r\nOpera, after three hours of fictitious sorrow, while I had been passing\r\nthat time in the presence of real affliction--side by side, as it were,\r\nin the face of each other, the mockery of woe and its solemn reality.\r\nAnd how often is it so! Unthought of--not, indeed, uncared for--but\r\nunthought of by the happy, the carriage rolls along, passing the\r\nhospital and the prison in its rapid progress; the golden youth,\r\nlistlessly reclining in happy indolence, hears not the voice of pain,\r\nsees not the hectic glow of suffering on the cheek; nursed in the sweet\r\nsorrows of romance, dreams not of living agonies more fearful than those\r\nwhich the greatest actor can portray, and of death as a reality.\r\n\r\nI determined to lose no time in fulfilling my mission. The directions of\r\nthe house where the child lived had been very carefully written, so I\r\nhad no difficulty in discovering it; but I had to pass through a\r\nlabyrinth of dirty streets, until at last, in a small, narrow lane, next\r\nthe Farnese Palace, I found the house. Evidently something had occurred\r\nto excite the inmates, for people were bustling about the door, and\r\nthere was unusual excitement for that late hour of the night. I stood\r\naside for a few moments to learn, if possible, what was the cause of all\r\nthis movement; and then I overheard expressions which made me tremble\r\nfor the safety of the poor child, if it was quite certain that she lived\r\nthere. \"Who did it? Where is the man? Poor child, how beautiful she\r\nwas!\" At last, unable to restrain my feelings, I rushed through the\r\ngroup, and asked whether a young girl of eight or ten years lived there.\r\n\r\n\"She did live here,\" said an old woman, with the tears trickling down\r\nher cheek,--\"she did live here, but she is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" I exclaimed; for however indifferent a person may be to us,\r\nperhaps in the circle of events nothing is more fearful than to seek the\r\nliving and find the corpse; to expect joy, and tremble before despair.\r\n\"Dead! When did she die? How did she die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come up, and see for yourself,\" said the woman; \"the room will explain\r\nevery thing.\" And the men made way for me, and I followed up a rickety\r\nstaircase to the third flat,--it was scarcely worth the name of a floor.\r\nAs we drew near the top I saw two or three myrmidons of the police; they\r\nall, I observed, looked pale--almost alarmed: evidently some great\r\ncatastrophe had occurred, but I had yet to learn the worst.\r\n\r\nThe light which the old woman held in her hand shone upon something\r\nsparkling on the ground. I touched her arm to point it out to her, and\r\nthen she threw the full blaze of light upon it, and I saw at once that\r\nit was blood. A cold, creeping sensation passed over me; that terrible\r\nconviction that in one moment we are going to be witnesses of the\r\neffects of a great crime almost paralyzed my senses; but, strange to\r\nsay, at this moment of horror I felt as if I had witnessed the whole\r\nscene before. When we entered the room, and I saw the body of a young\r\nand lovely child lying on the floor, bathed in blood, I did not shrink\r\neven then, although destitution and crime were both presented to me in\r\ntheir most fearful aspect. My nerves appeared to have been braced for\r\nsome great necessity. The police were standing by perfectly irresolute,\r\nand incapable of taking any decided course, when one of them picked up a\r\nhandkerchief from the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Rachel!\" he exclaimed, looking at the corner.\r\n\r\nI started at the name, and then a sudden idea flashed across me: it was\r\nFlavio who had been here, and with that devilish spirit of revenge to\r\nwhich Rachel alluded, he had killed his own child. I took the chief of\r\nthe police to one side, and asked him if he knew Flavio.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he replied. \"I was one of the band who were sent in pursuit of\r\nhim for two or three months. We fell in with him several times, but\r\nnever were able to take him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better inquire about him,\" I said; \"for I strongly suspect him\r\nof having committed this murder.\"\r\n\r\nHe took my suggestion, and it appeared that a man, precisely resembling\r\nFlavio, had been seen leaving the house at the time of the murder. When\r\nonce suspicion was directed into the right channel, numerous\r\ncorroborative circumstances were cited. It appeared that Flavio came\r\nconstantly to see the child: the only strange part of the case was that\r\nhe appeared very fond of it, and as tender and considerate towards it as\r\na man of his brutal nature could be. There clearly must have been some\r\nground for this sudden and unprovoked attack,--if, indeed, he committed\r\nit; after exhausting every possible motive, we could not arrive at any\r\ndefinite conclusion.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the horror of the spectacle grew upon me: it presented\r\nitself no longer as a picture to my imagination, but as a fearful fact.\r\nThe crowd of people who forced their way into the room--the blasphemous\r\nand terrible expressions--the coarse jokes--the vulgar, obscene\r\nlanguage--the poor child, not fashioned tenderly, but lying like a\r\nconfused mass of clothes and gore upon the floor, perfectly sickened my\r\nheart. And when I thought that I could not be of any further use, I was\r\ntoo happy to turn away.\r\n\r\nI returned home, but could not sleep. All the events of the day crowded\r\nupon my mind. My dream had been dreamt before I laid my head upon the\r\npillow: it now filled my brain like a horrible vision. I rose early,\r\nwearied with restlessness, and went immediately in search of M. Narelli.\r\nTo my great surprise I found that he was up, and in close communication\r\nwith the chief of the police, whom I had seen on the preceding night at\r\nthe poor child's room. I was immediately shown into his office, and I\r\nobserved that his countenance betrayed an anxiety and annoyance unusual\r\nin persons of his nature under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to tell him my story, when he interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" he said, \"pardon me, but we have no time to lose, and I\r\nknow it all. A murder has been committed, and there is no question that\r\nFlavio is the murderer: and I will tell you something more that will\r\nsurprise you. I know the cause of the murder--the motives that\r\ninfluenced him. What do you think?--he was present at the examination of\r\nthat girl, yesterday!\"\r\n\r\n\"He!\" I exclaimed, with an expression of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"It is surprising what he can do,\" he said: \"he was disguised like a\r\nsoldier on guard; and, if you remember, two or three of them were\r\nlistening when the door was opened, when I returned after your interview\r\nwith Rachel.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole mystery was now explained: he had murdered the child to\r\nrevenge himself on Rachel.\r\n\r\n\"What I fear is,\" continued M. Narelli, \"that we are three hours too\r\nlate, and the fellow has escaped; but we have sent off in all\r\ndirections, and all that can be will be done. I am now going to see the\r\npoor girl, will you come with me?\"\r\n\r\nA strange fascination made me do so; besides, I wished to restore the\r\nobjects which she had given into my charge. When we arrived we found her\r\nasleep: the jailer awoke her more gently and with more consideration\r\nthan before, for her sorrow had touched even his heart. When she saw me\r\nshe gave an exclamation of joy.\r\n\r\n\"And my child?\" she said.\r\n\r\nI could not answer a word, but put the packet into her hand.\r\n\r\nShe looked up with a kind of vague, incredulous smile, and passed her\r\nhand across her forehead, as though to reflect more clearly.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen her, and you have not given it to her,\" she said. \"What\r\ndoes it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means,\" said M. Narelli, \"that your child is the victim of an act of\r\nfearful treachery, of a dreadful crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"My child! my child!\" she shrieked aloud. \"There is but one man who\r\ncould hurt a child, a sweet child like that--its own father!\"\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head for a time, and raised it again only to utter the\r\nmost fearful ravings. Fit followed fit; her whole frame was convulsed,\r\nand I withdrew in horror and anguish.\r\n\r\nThe result may be shortly stated. She went mad, and was confined in an\r\nasylum,--one of those glorious charitable establishments of which modern\r\nRome can boast. Flavio escaped to the Campo Morto, where he is now\r\nliving,--an asylum for men guilty of the blackest crimes, where they\r\ngradually fall victims to the pestilential vapors which they inhale, and\r\nperish beneath the brightest sun while cultivating the soil so soon to\r\nbecome their graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the American Whig Review for January.\r\n\r\nHENRY C. CAREY, AND HIS POLITICAL ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nBY RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry C. Carey has been recognized through continental Europe as one of\r\nthe master thinkers of our generation. It is time for him to be known in\r\nhis own country. In Political Economy he has applied the methods of the\r\nPositive Philosophy, and his works exhibit the chief advances the\r\nscience has made since Adam Smith published his \"Wealth of Nations.\"\r\nThey are text-books in the colleges even of Sweden and Norway, while at\r\nthe University in the street next to that in which the author has his\r\nresidence, books are adopted composed of ideas from empirical and nearly\r\nobsolete systems: Say and Ricardo are regarded as expositors of the last\r\nand ultimate discoveries. Let us see if this law respecting prophets\r\ncannot be changed; or if not changed, confirmed, by an exception in the\r\ncase of our philosopher.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey was born in Philadelphia, in December, 1793. His father was\r\nthe late eminent Matthew Carey, memories of whose virtues preserve about\r\nhis name a thousand delightful associations. Matthew Carey was a\r\npolitical economist also. He wrote much, and he wrote effectively,\r\nbecause he taught that which was in accordance with the feelings and\r\ninterests of his readers; but he was of the old school, dead now, with\r\nits professors. He disliked abstract ideas or principles, and did not\r\ntrouble himself much with their investigation. The consequence was, that\r\nhe made no addition to politico-economical knowledge, and left nothing\r\nby which he should be remembered except the fact that he was a\r\nconsistent and ardent friend of Protection.\r\n\r\nRicardo left his doctrine of Rents; Malthus his principle of Population;\r\ntheir books are little read now, and they themselves would have been\r\nlong since forgotten, but that they taught what had been taught by no\r\nothers. Of the hundreds of their countrymen who have since written,\r\nscarcely one has furnished a new idea; or if such an idea can be found\r\nin the books of any one, it will not bear investigation. Many have\r\ncollected facts, that are useful, and all of them have talked and\r\nwritten about their facts and theories; but only as empirics. One man\r\ncontended on one side and another on another, and there was no standard\r\nby which to judge them. Ricardo and Malthus gave laws that would not fit\r\nthe facts, and the facts were altered and suppressed to suit the\r\nlaws.[22] McCulloch taught that transportation and exchange were more\r\nadvantageous than production,[23] and Cobden that it was better to go to\r\ncolonies in which _rich_ lands were to be had cheap, than to stay at\r\nhome where landlords charged high rents for the _poor_ ones that were\r\nnecessarily cultivated: and therefore that imported food would be\r\ncheaper than that which was grown at home. The result has proved that he\r\nwas wrong. Food is now obtained with more difficulty than before;\r\nemigration is necessary, and the late decision in Parliament shows that\r\nProtection will be restored: as the ministry could command only the mean\r\nmajority of 21.\r\n\r\nA few years hence McCulloch will be remembered only as the compiler of a\r\nfew indifferent books of reference, and Cobden as the author of much ill\r\nto the people of England. Many of these men have ideas that are sound;\r\nbut they know nothing of the principles of the science they undertake to\r\nteach; and so they are continually making blunders. Of all the French\r\nwriters of the first forty years of this century, only one, Jean\r\nBaptiste Say, has lived to the middle of it, and his work is only a mass\r\nof error in an imposing form.\r\n\r\nThis may be called sweeping criticism; but time will prove that it is\r\njust. We need principles, as the astronomers did before Copernicus,\r\nKepler and Newton, gave them the laws which govern the movements of the\r\nuniverse. Others observed facts and wrote treatises, but only these\r\nnames have lived. Ricardo and Malthus furnished what they believed to be\r\nthe great natural laws in regard to land and the sources of its value;\r\nthe relation of the laborer and the capitalist; and of population. Their\r\nnames are still familiar, but their theories are shattered by the\r\nassaults of critics; they will be forgotten, and their places will be\r\noccupied by those of the great author of whose works we propose to\r\nwrite. Ricardo and Malthus will be to Carey as Ptolemy to Copernicus.\r\n\r\nFrom 1803, a period of almost fifty years, since Ricardo published his\r\ndoctrine of Rent, there has not been even an attempt, except Carey's, to\r\nadd any thing to political economy. Senior, Whateley, and a thousand\r\nothers, have been disputing about words, while as many others have been\r\nattacking Malthus and Ricardo; but no one has attempted to discover\r\nlaws, to take the place of those which were assailed. Of the supporters\r\nof these writers, every one has been compelled to admit that their laws\r\ndid not cover the facts, and to interpolate accommodating passages. John\r\nStuart Mill, in his recent work, has done this even more largely than\r\nhis predecessors, and so furnished additional proof that their laws were\r\n_not_ laws, but mere anarchy. Ricardo had to leave a place of escape for\r\ndifficult facts[24] and his successors have since found themselves\r\nobliged to open so many new ones, that his laws are now like sieves.\r\n\r\nThe period was propitious for a discoverer. The opinion of D'Alembert\r\nthat the steps of Civilization were to be taken in the middle of each\r\ncentury, was to be confirmed by a new illustration.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey's father was a practical man; all his children were trained to\r\naffairs; thus they became observers. The students of books are rarely\r\ncreators in science. Truth is most likely to be evolved in the school of\r\nexperience. From the age of seven years until he was twenty-one, Mr.\r\nCarey was in his father's bookstore. From 1821 to 1838, he was a partner\r\nin the important publishing house of Carey, Lea & Carey, and Carey &\r\nLea; but in this period he passed one season abroad, we believe\r\nimmediately after his marriage with a sister of Leslie the painter. The\r\ndetermination of his mind was already fixed, when his retirement from\r\nbusiness enabled him to devote his faculties entirely to the science\r\nwith which his name will for ever be associated.\r\n\r\nMr. Carey's first book--_An Essay on the Rate of Wages_--was published\r\nin 1836, and was soon after expanded into _The Principles of Political\r\nEconomy_, which appeared in three octavo volumes in 1837--1840.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to give an account of this performance, we will more\r\nparticularly show what was, at the date of its publication, the\r\ncondition of the science it was designed to illustrate. Mr. Malthus had\r\ntaught that population tended to increase faster than food, and that so\r\nirresistible was this tendency, that all human efforts to restrain the\r\nnumber of men within the limits of subsistence were vain. It was a great\r\n\"law of nature,\" and it was of little consequence, therefore, how fast\r\nfood might be increased, since the only effect must be to stimulate\r\npopulation, which, in the end, was sure to outrun the means of living.\r\nThe impression which this work produced has been briefly noticed in what\r\nwe have written in connection with Mr. Alexander H. Everett's reply to\r\nit, printed in London and Boston in 1822. The doctrine was a convenient\r\none, for it relieved the directors of affairs from the charge of\r\ncausing, or suffering, the poverty and wretchedness by which they were\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, Mr. Ricardo attempted to explain by what means the\r\nsupply of food was limited. He taught that men always commenced the work\r\nof cultivation on the most fertile soils, capable of yielding, say, one\r\nhundred quarters for a given quantity of labor; but that as population\r\nincreased, it became necessary to resort to poorer soils, yielding but\r\nninety quarters, and that then the owner of the first could command as\r\nrent ten quarters. With a further increase, lands of a third quality,\r\nyielding but eighty quarters, were brought into use, and then the first\r\nand second would command as rent the whole difference, say, twenty\r\nquarters for the first, and ten quarters for the second. The payment of\r\nrent is thus regarded, in this school, as an evidence of constantly\r\ndiminishing reward of labor, resulting from the increase of population\r\nin consequence of which it is necessary to extend the area of\r\ncultivation. With each step of its progress, the owner of the land takes\r\na larger proportion of this constantly decreasing product, leaving a\r\nsmaller one to be divided among those who apply either labor or capital\r\nto cultivation, thus producing a constant increase in the _inequality_\r\nof human condition. The interests of the landlord are in this manner\r\nshown to be for ever opposed to those of all the other portions of\r\nsociety. Rent is supposed to be paid because land has been occupied in\r\nvirtue of an exercise of power and not because the owners have done any\r\nthing to entitle them to it. Here we see the germ of that discord which\r\neverywhere in Europe exists between the payers and receivers of rent.\r\nThe annual fund from which savings can be made is held to be continually\r\ndiminishing, the poor becoming poorer as the rich grow richer. The\r\ntendency to increase is more powerful in population than in capital, and\r\nthe natural result must be that \"wages will be reduced so low that a\r\nportion of the population will regularly die of want.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the promulgation of these principles, upon the science of\r\nwhich they were asserted to be the basis, was curious. It was clear that\r\nincrease of population led to famine. It was equally clear that increase\r\nof wealth tended to the extension of cultivation over inferior soils,\r\nwith constantly decreasing returns to labor. Nevertheless, the political\r\neconomist was everywhere surrounded by facts showing that the condition\r\nof man improved as numbers increased, and as cultivation was extended.\r\nWith lessened rewards of toil there should be deterioration of moral\r\ncondition, and abridged facilities for intellectual cultivation, but it\r\nwas incontestable that men were more moral and better instructed than in\r\nany previous centuries. The increasing disproportion between the share\r\nof the landlord and that of the laborer was calculated to increase the\r\ninequality of condition, and yet it was not to be doubted that the two\r\nwere nearer together than they were in the days of Elizabeth or of Henry\r\nVIII. The fact and the theory were always at variance with each other,\r\nand hence resulted a determination to limit the science to the\r\nconsideration of wealth alone, excluding all reference to social\r\ncondition. Mr. McCulloch therefore defined Political Economy as the\r\nScience of Values, and Archbishop Whately desired to change the name to\r\nCatallactics, or the Science of Exchanges. The whole duty of the teacher\r\nof this new science was held to be that of explaining how wealth might\r\nbe increased, allowing \"neither sympathy with indigence, nor disgust at\r\nprofusion nor at avarice; neither reverence for existing institutions,\r\nnor detestation of existing abuses; neither love of popularity, nor of\r\nparadox, nor of system, to deter him from stating what he believed to be\r\nthe facts, or from drawing from those facts what appeared to him to be\r\nthe legitimate conclusions.\"[26]\r\n\r\nSuch was the Political Economy then, and such is that which is now,\r\ntaught in the schools of England. The consequences are seen in the\r\nmanner in which the poor people of every part of the United Kingdom are\r\nbeing expelled from the little holdings to which they have been reduced\r\nby a system of unbounded public expenditure, and the contemptuous tone\r\nin which the common people are spoken of in all their journals. Charity\r\nis denounced as tending to promote the growth of population. Marriage\r\namong the poor is regarded as a crime, and farmers are regarded as\r\nparticipant in crime for giving employment to men with families in\r\npreference to single men. But the system itself was an enormous wrong\r\nagainst nature. Mr. Carey entered the lists against it, with the\r\nearnestness and confidence inspired by a conviction that he contended\r\nfor humanity.\r\n\r\nHis book commences with a single elementary proposition, that man\r\ndesires to maintain and improve his condition, whether physical, moral,\r\nintellectual, or political: and the object of it is to show, that the\r\ntheories of Mr. Malthus and Mr. Ricardo are in direct opposition to the\r\nuniversal fact, and therefore cannot be regarded as natural laws. On the\r\ncontrary, he shows that food has always grown faster than population,\r\nand that the power to obtain subsistence has always increased most\r\nrapidly in those countries, and at those times, in which population has\r\nmost rapidly increased, and in which cultivation has most rapidly\r\nextended over those soils denominated by Mr. Ricardo inferior. The error\r\nof all these writers is shown to be in taking _quantities_ instead of\r\n_proportions_, and it is the law of proportions that constitutes the\r\nnovel feature of this work. Ricardo and Malthus assert that land, labor,\r\nand capital are the agents of production, and are subject to different\r\nlaws, all tending to produce contrariety of interests, and that the\r\nreason why such is the case is that land owes its value--or power to\r\ncommand rent for its use--to _monopoly_, while capital is the\r\naccumulated product of labor. Mr. Carey, on the contrary, shows, by a\r\nvast variety of facts, that land owes its value to labor alone, and that\r\nits selling price is _invariably_ less than would purchase the quantity\r\nof labor required to induce its present condition were it restored to a\r\nstate of nature. It is, therefore, like steam-engines, mills, or ships,\r\nto be considered as capital, the interest upon which is called rent, and\r\nit is subject to the same laws as capital in any other form. With the\r\ngrowth of wealth and population, the landlord is shown to be receiving a\r\nconstantly decreasing _proportion_ of the product of labor applied to\r\ncultivation, but a constantly increasing _quantity_, because of the\r\nrapid increase in the amount of the return as cultivation is improved\r\nand extended.[27] So it is with the capitalist. The _rate_ of interest\r\nfalls as cultivation is improved, and capital is accumulated with\r\ngreater facility, and the capitalist receives a smaller _proportion_;\r\nbut the _quantity_ of commodities obtainable in return for the use of a\r\ngiven amount of capital increases, and with every change in that\r\ndirection there is shown to be an increasing tendency to equality and to\r\nimprovement of condition, physical, moral, intellectual, and political.\r\n\r\nAccording to the system of Mr. Ricardo, the interests of the land owner\r\nand laborer, the capitalist and the employer of capital, are always\r\nopposed to each other. Mr. Carey, on the contrary, proves, and we think\r\nmost conclusively, that \"the interests of the capitalist and of the\r\nemployer of capital are thus in perfect harmony with each other, as each\r\nderives advantage from every measure that tends to facilitate the growth\r\nof capital, and to render labor productive; while every measure that\r\ntends to produce the opposite effect is injurious to both.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThe entire novelty of these views rendered it necessary that they should\r\nbe supported by a great body of facts, and Mr. Carey therefore furnished\r\nan examination of the causes which have in various countries,\r\nparticularly India, France, Great Britain, and the United States,\r\nretarded the growth of wealth--demonstrating that they were to be found\r\nin the great public expenditure for the support of fleets and armies,\r\nand the prosecution of wars, the natural results of a state of things in\r\nwhich the few govern the many, taxing them at their will; and that the\r\nremedy was to be found in that improvement of political condition which\r\nshould enable men to govern and to tax themselves, doing which they\r\nwould be disposed to remain at peace.\r\n\r\nThat man may be enabled to improve his physical condition, combination\r\nof effort is shown to be necessary, and that tends to increase with the\r\nincrease in the density of population. Therewith comes increased\r\nsecurity of person and property, and increased respect for the rights of\r\nothers, tending to promote the further increase of wealth, and to enable\r\nmen to devote more time to the cultivation of mind. Improved mental\r\ncondition enables men to apply their labors more productively, and thus\r\nobtain better subsistence from a diminished surface, facilitates\r\ncombination of action, and increases the growth of wealth. With its\r\ngrowth the proportion of the laborer increases, and that of the landlord\r\nor other capitalist decreases, and the power of the former to govern\r\nhimself, and to tax himself, grows steadily with the growth of wealth\r\nand population; and thus we have physical, moral, intellectual and\r\npolitical improvement, each aiding, and aided by, the other.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this brief summary that the field occupied is a\r\nmost extensive one, more so than that of any similar work that has been\r\nwritten. The views are presented with great distinctness and force, and\r\nillustrated throughout by numerous facts drawn not only from the four\r\ncountries principally referred to, but from Italy, the Netherlands,\r\nNorway, Sweden, Switzerland, &c. It is one of the chief distinguishing\r\nmerits of the work, that each part of it, while complete in itself, has\r\nthat relation to the other which belongs to the divisions of a whole, in\r\nwhich all things are so interblended and harmonious as to produce a\r\ncumulative and finally perfect effect; while in the various systems\r\npresented to us by Europe, every part is in conflict with every other.\r\n\r\nIn denying Mr. Ricardo's _theory of the occupation of the earth_, Mr.\r\nCarey did not undertake to present any by himself, but this he has done\r\nin his more recent performance, The Past, the Present and the Future,\r\npublished in Philadelphia in 1848. In this original and masterly\r\ncomposition, he has shown that the law is in direct opposition to the\r\nprinciple announced by Mr. Ricardo, and since adopted in the English\r\nschool, and to some extent in France and in this country. In the infancy\r\nof civilization, man is poor and works with poor machinery, and must\r\ntake the high and poor soils requiring little clearing and no drainage;\r\nand it is only as population and wealth increase, that the richer soils\r\nare brought into cultivation. The consequence is, that in obedience to a\r\ngreat law of nature, _food tends to increase more rapidly than\r\npopulation_, and it is only by that combination of effort which results\r\nfrom increasing density of population that the richer soils can be\r\nbrought into activity. The truth of this is shown by a careful and\r\nparticular account of the settlement of this country, followed by a\r\nrapid sketch of the occupation of Mexico, the West Indies, South\r\nAmerica, Great Britain, France, Italy, Greece, India, and the Islands of\r\nthe Pacific, illustrating and confirming the position that the poor\r\nlands at the heads of streams, or the small and rocky islands, are first\r\nchosen for cultivation, while the lower and richer soils are left\r\nunimproved for want of the means which come with growing wealth and\r\npopulation. Mr. Ricardo's theory is then examined in all its parts, and\r\nshown to be entirely opposed to the whole mass of facts presented in a\r\nrapid review of the course of events in the different portions of the\r\nworld, while the exceptions made by him for the purpose of providing for\r\nthe infinite number that could not be brought under his general law, are\r\nshown to be _themselves the law_; and that such is the case is now\r\nadmitted by some of the most eminent economists of Europe.\r\n\r\nWith the downfall of Mr. Ricardo's hypothesis of the occupation of land,\r\ndisappears the base on which rests the celebrated theory of Mr.\r\nMalthus--a theory which has been largely discussed in this country by\r\nMr. Everett and others, and which is examined at length from his point\r\nof view by Mr. Carey, who shows that everywhere increase of population\r\nhas led to the cultivation of the lower and richer soils, followed by\r\nincrease in the facility of obtaining food, while depopulation has\r\neverywhere been marked by the retreat of cultivation to the hills; a\r\ntruth which he illustrates by numerous instances.\r\n\r\nHe next surveys the circumstances attending the progress of wealth. It\r\nis held by the English economists that capital, applied to land, must\r\nnecessarily bring diminishing profits, because applied to a machine of\r\nconstantly decreasing powers; and that, therefore, manufactures and\r\ntrade, steam-engines and ships, are more profitable than agriculture;\r\nwhereas, Mr. Carey shows that land is a machine of constantly\r\n_increasing_ capacities, and that the only manner in which machinery of\r\nany description is beneficial, is by diminishing the labor required for\r\nconverting and transporting the products of the earth, and permitting a\r\nlarger quantity to be given to the work of production. The earth is the\r\nsole producer, says Mr. Carey, and man merely fashions and exchanges her\r\nproducts, adding nothing to the quantity to be converted or exchanged,\r\nand the growth of wealth everywhere is shown to be in the ratio of the\r\nquantity of labor that can be given to the cultivation of the great\r\nmachine bestowed on man for the production of food and wool. This leads\r\nto an examination of the British system, the object of which is shown\r\nto have been that of compelling the people of every part of the world to\r\nbring to her their raw products to be converted and exchanged, thus\r\nwasting on the road a large portion of them, and all the manure that\r\nwould result from their home consumption, the consequence of which is\r\nshown to be the exhaustion of the land and its owner. The broad ground\r\nis then taken that the products of the land should be consumed upon the\r\nland, and that nations grow rich or remain poor precisely as they act in\r\naccordance with, or in opposition to, that view. Mr. Carey is a\r\nfree-trader. In his first book he advocated the British doctrine of\r\ndiminished duties, as the means of bringing about free trade. In his\r\n_Past and Present_ he admits his error, and shows that the protective\r\nsystem was the result of an instinctive effort at the correction of a\r\ngreat evil inflicted upon the world by British legislation, and that\r\n_the only course towards perfect freedom of trade is to be found in\r\nperfect protection_.\r\n\r\nThe effect of increasing wealth and population resulting from the power\r\nto cultivate the richer soils, in bringing about the division of land\r\nand the union of man is then shown, and illustrated by examples drawn\r\nfrom the history of the principal nations of the world, ancient and\r\nmodern; and here the European system of primogeniture is examined, with\r\na view to show that it is purely artificial, and tends to disappear with\r\nthe growth of wealth and population. This leads to the discussion of the\r\nrelations of man to his fellow-men, which are shown to tend to the\r\nestablishment of equality wherever peace is maintained, and wealth and\r\npopulation are allowed to grow; and to inequality, with every step in\r\nthe progress of war and devastation.\r\n\r\nMan himself next appears on the scene. Mr. Malthus, Mr. Ricardo, and all\r\nothers of the English School, represent him as the slave of his\r\nnecessities, working because he fears starvation. Mr. Carey, on the\r\ncontrary, shows him to be animated by hope, and improving in all his\r\nmoral qualities, precisely as by the growth of wealth and\r\npopulation--the results of peace--he is enabled to clear and cultivate\r\nthe rich soils of the earth.\r\n\r\nThence we pass to the relations of man and his helpmate, which are shown\r\nto improve precisely as do those of man to his fellow-man, as the rich\r\nsoils are brought into cultivation. Man and his family follow, and the\r\nsame improvement, under the same circumstances, is shown to take place\r\nin the relations of parent and child.\r\n\r\nConcentration, or the habit of local self-government, so strikingly\r\nillustrated in New-England, is next examined in contrast with\r\ncentralization, as exhibited in England and France, and its admirable\r\neffects in tending to the maintenance of peace are fully exhibited. The\r\nvarious systems of colonization next pass in review, and give occasion\r\nfor an examination of the various causes that brought negro slavery into\r\nthis country, and the reason why it is here alone that the race has\r\nincreased in numbers. India and Ireland, and the devastating effects of\r\nthe colonial system, Annexation, and Civilization, furnish the materials\r\nfor the succeeding chapters, and give occasion--the last\r\nparticularly--for the expression of opinions much at variance with those\r\ntaught by Guizot and others of the most distinguished men of our day.\r\nSuch are the Past and Present. The closing chapter is the Future, and\r\ncontains an examination of many remarkable facts now presented to our\r\nview by our own country, produced by the existence of the unnatural\r\nsystem fastened upon the world by England, and to be remedied by the\r\nadoption of an American policy, having for its object that of enabling\r\nmen to live together and combine their exertions, instead of flying from\r\neach other, leaving behind rich lands uncultivated, and going to Texas\r\nor Oregon to begin the work of cultivation on the poorer ones. \"With\r\neach step in the progress of concentration his physical condition would\r\nimprove, because he would cultivate more fertile lands, and obtain\r\nincreased power over the treasures of the earth. His moral condition\r\nwould improve, because he would have greater inducements to steady and\r\nregular labor, and the reward of good conduct would steadily increase.\r\nHis intellectual condition would improve, because he would have more\r\nleisure for study, and more power to mix with his fellow-men at home or\r\nabroad; to learn what they knew, and to see what they possessed; while\r\nthe reward of talent would steadily increase, and that of mere brute\r\nwealth would steadily decline. His political condition would improve,\r\nbecause he would acquire an increased power over the application of his\r\nlabor and of its proceeds. He would be less governed, better governed,\r\nand more cheaply governed, and all because more perfectly\r\nself-governed.\"\r\n\r\nThe field surveyed by Mr. Carey in the _Past and Present_ is a broad\r\none--broader than that of any other book of our time--for it discusses\r\nevery interest of man. The ideas are original--whether true or not, they\r\nare both new and bold. They are based upon a great law of Nature, and it\r\nis the first time that any system of political economy has been offered\r\nto the world that was so based. The consequence is, that all the facts\r\nplace themselves, as completely as did the planets when Copernicus had\r\nsatisfied himself that the earth revolved around the sun.[29]\r\n\r\nMore recently, in his _Harmony of Interests_, Mr. Carey has published a\r\nfull examination of the great question of commercial policy, with a view\r\nto show that protection, as it exists in this country, is the true and\r\n_only_ road to free trade. He has brought to the illustration of this\r\nimportant doctrine a mass of facts, greater, probably, than was ever\r\nbefore displayed in support of any position in political economy. It\r\ncommences with an examination of our whole commercial policy for the\r\nlast thirty years, and shows the effect of protection in increasing the\r\nsum of production and consumption, the means of transportation, internal\r\nand external, and the influx of population from abroad, always an\r\nevidence of the increased productiveness of labor. In this work it is\r\nshown conclusively, that shipping grows with protection, because\r\nprotection tends to promote immigration, or the import of men, the most\r\nvaluable of commodities, and thus to diminish the cost of _sending_ to\r\nmarket the less valuable ones, grain, tobacco, and cotton. The question\r\nis examined in every point of view--material, moral, intellectual, and\r\npolitical; and the result arrived at is, \"that between the interests of\r\nthe treasury and the people, the farmer, planter, manufacturer and\r\nmerchant, the great and little trader and the ship-owner, the slave and\r\nhis master, the land-owners and laborers of the Union and the world, the\r\nfree-trader and the advocate of protection, there is perfect harmony of\r\ninterests, and that the way to the establishment of universal peace and\r\nuniversal free trade, is to be found in the adoption of measures tending\r\nto the destruction of the _monopoly of machinery_, and the location of\r\nthe loom and the anvil in the vicinity of the plough and the harrow.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the works I have named, Mr. Carey has published two\r\nothers, on the Currency--the larger of which is entitled _Credit System\r\nin France, England, and the United States_. Their object is to show,\r\nthat there is a very simple law which lies at the root of the whole\r\ncurrency question, and that by its aid the revulsions so frequently\r\nexperienced may be perfectly accounted for. That law is perfect freedom\r\nof trade in money, whether by individuals or associations, leaving the\r\nlatter to make their own terms with their customers, and to assume\r\nlimited or unlimited liability, as they themselves may think most\r\nexpedient. In a detailed review of the operations of several of the\r\nprincipal nations, and of all the States of this Union, it is shown that\r\nthe tendency to steadiness in the quantity, and uniformity in the\r\nquality, of currency, is in the exact ratio of freedom, while with every\r\nincrease in the number or extent of restrictions, steadiness diminishes\r\nand insecurity increases. The views contained in this work are now\r\nadopted by some of the most eminent writers in France. They constitute\r\nthe basis of a recent and excellent work[30] by M. Coquelin, who quotes\r\nlargely from that of Mr. Carey, declaring that our countryman has, \"in\r\nthe investigation of causes and effects, succeeded better than the\r\nEnglish inquirers,\" and had, as early as 1838, \"clearly shown the\r\nprimary causes of the perturbations recurring almost periodically in\r\ncommerce and currency.\"[31]\r\n\r\nSince these paragraphs were written, Mr. Carey has commenced the\r\npublication of a series of Letters to Mr. Walker, the late Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, in which he promises more largely and satisfactorily than\r\nheretofore to indicate and vindicate his opinions upon the subject of\r\nTrade. They are likely to have a powerful influence upon affairs, being\r\nof that class of compositions which the mind receives with astonishment\r\nthat it had not anticipated their truth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Thus we see by a correspondence published in the London papers that\r\nMr. Horace Mayhew, author of the metropolitan \"Labor and the Poor\"\r\narticles, has ceased to write for the London _Morning Chronicle_, the\r\nconductors of that journal wishing him to _suppress_, in his reports on\r\nthe condition of the working classes, _facts opposed to free trade_.\r\n\r\n[23] See Carey's Past, Present and Future, p. 128.\r\n\r\n[24] The Past, the Present and the Future, pp. 70, 71.\r\n\r\n[25] Mr. Mill, quoted by Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\n[26] Mr. Senior, quoted by Mr. Carey.\r\n\r\n[27] By the following passages, which we take from M. Bastiat's new\r\nwork, _Harmonies Economiques_, it will be seen that he adopts these\r\nviews as the basis of his political economy: \"_A mesure que les capitaux\r\ns'accroissent, la part_ absolue _des capitalistes dans les produits\r\ntotaux augmente et leur part_ relative _diminue. Au contraire, les\r\ntravailleurs voient augmenter leur part dans les deux sens._ (p.\r\n280).... Ainsi le partage se fera de la maniere suivante.\r\n\r\n\r\nProduit total. Part du capital. Part du travail. Premiere periode, 1000\r\n500 500 Deuxieme periode, 2000 800 1200 Troisieme periode, 3000 1050\r\n1950 Quatrieme periode, 4000 1200 2800\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Telle est la grande, admirable, consolante, necessaire, et _inflexible_\r\nloi du capital.\"--(p. 281.)\r\n\r\n\"Ainsi la grande loi du capital et du travail, en ce qui concerne le\r\npartage du produit de la collaboration, est determinee. Chacun d'eux a\r\nune part _absolue_ de plus en plus grand, mais la part _proportionnelle_\r\ndu capital diminue sans cesse comparativement a celle du travail.\"--(p.\r\n284.)\r\n\r\n_Cause of value in Land._--\"Cette valeur, comme tous les autres, est de\r\ncreation humaine et social.\"--p. 362. After reciting the various modes\r\nof applying labor to the improvement of land, he says: \"La valeur c'est\r\nincorporee, confondue dans le sol, et c'est pourquoi on poura tres bien\r\ndire par metonymie: _le sol vaut_.\"--(p. 363.)\r\n\r\nLand not changeable for as much labor as it has cost. \"J'ose affirmer\r\nqu'il n'est pas un champ en France qui _vaille_ ce qu'il a coute, qui\r\npuisse s'echanger contre autant de travail qu'il en a exige pour etre\r\nmis a l'etat de productivite ou il se trouve.\"--(p. 398.)\r\n\r\n_Cause of this._--\"Vous avez employee mille journees a mettre votre\r\ndomaine dans l'etat ou il est; je ne vous en restituerai que huit cents,\r\net ma raison est qu'avec huit cents journees je puis faire aujourd'hui\r\nsur la terre a cote ce qu'avec mille vous avez fait autrefois sur la\r\nvotre. Veuillez considerer que depuis quinze ans l'art de dessecher, de\r\ndetricher, de batir, de creuser des puits, de disposer les etables,\r\nd'executer les transports a fait des progres. Chaque resultat donne\r\nexige moins du travail, et je ne veux me soumettre a vous donner dix de\r\nce que je puis avoir pour huit, d'autant que le prix du ble a diminue\r\ndans la proportion de ce progres, que ne profite ni a vous ni a moi,\r\nmais a l'humanite tout entiere.\"--(p. 368.)\r\n\r\nThe reader who may desire to see the perfect correspondence of these\r\nviews with those published by Mr. Carey, as far back as 1837, may do so\r\nby a glance at Chapters II., III., IV., and VII. of his first volume,\r\nwhere he gives a great number of facts in support of ideas then so new,\r\nand of course so heretical.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact, to which we now desire to call the attention of our\r\nreaders, is, that which M. Bastiat has thus adopted the views of Mr.\r\nCarey, without, so far as we have been able to see, alteration or\r\naddition. His name never occurs in the work, except as authority for one\r\nof his quotations, which M. Bastiat has copied, while the names of\r\nRicardo, Malthus, Senior, Scrope, Considerant, and a host of others, are\r\nfound in almost every chapter. It must be highly gratifying to Mr. Carey\r\nto see his views obtain so entirely the approbation of a man of the\r\nreputation of M. Bastiat, that he should be willing to give them to the\r\nworld as his own.\r\n\r\n[28] Vol. I., p. 339.\r\n\r\n[29] This work has been much read abroad, and we perceive that it has\r\nrecently been translated into Swedish, and published at Stockholm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Blackwood's Magazine.\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL: OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 285._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.--INITIAL CHAPTER, SHOWING HOW MY NOVEL CAME TO BE CALLED \"MY\r\nNOVEL.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not displeased with your novel, so far as it has gone,\" said my\r\nfather graciously; \"though as for The Sermon--\"\r\n\r\nHere I trembled; but the ladies, Heaven bless them! had taken Parson\r\nDale under their special protection; and observing that my father was\r\npuckering up his brows critically, they rushed boldly forward in defence\r\nof The Sermon, and Mr. Caxton was forced to beat a retreat. However,\r\nlike a skillful general, he renewed the assault upon outposts less\r\ngallantly guarded. But as it is not my business to betray my weak\r\npoints, I leave it to the ingenuity of cavillers to discover the places\r\nat which the Author of _Human Error_ directed his great guns.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the Captain, \"you are a lad of too much spirit, Pisistratus,\r\nto keep us always in the obscure country quarters of Hazeldean--you will\r\nmarch us out into open service before you have done with us?\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, magisterially, for he has been somewhat nettled by Mr.\r\nCaxton's remarks--and he puts on an air of dignity, in order to awe away\r\nminor assailants.--\"Yes, Captain Roland--not yet awhile, but all in good\r\ntime.

I have\r\nnever yet thought of a title!\"\r\n\r\n_Captain Roland_, solemnly.--\"There is a great deal in a good title. As\r\na novel-reader, I know that by experience.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Squills._--\"Certainly; there is not a catchpenny in the world but\r\nwhat goes down, if the title be apt and seductive.

Let us\r\nturn to the Romans. Aulus Gellius commences his pleasant gossiping\r\n'Noctes' with a list of the titles in fashion in his day. For instance,\r\n'_The Muses_' and '_The Veil_,' '_The Cornucopia_,' '_The Beehive_,' and\r\n'_The Meadow_.' Some titles, indeed, were more truculent, and promised\r\nfood to those who love to sup upon horrors--such as '_The Torch_,' '_The\r\nPoniard_,' '_The Stiletto_'--\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, impatiently.--\"Yes, sir; but to come to My Novel.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, unheeding the interruption.--\"You see, you have a fine\r\nchoice here, and of a nature pleasing, and not unfamiliar to a classical\r\nreader; or you may borrow a hint from the early Dramatic Writers.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, more hopefully.--\"Ay! there is something in the Drama\r\nakin to the Novel. Now, perhaps, I may catch an idea.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"For instance, the author of the _Curiosities of\r\nLiterature_ (from whom, by the way, I am plagiarizing much of the\r\ninformation I bestow upon you), tells us of a Spanish gentleman who\r\nwrote a Comedy, by which he intended to serve what he took for Moral\r\nPhilosophy.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, eagerly.--\"Well, sir?\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"And called it 'The Pain of the Sleep of the World.'\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus._--\"Very comic indeed, sir!\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"Grave things were then called Comedies, as old things\r\nare now called Novels. Then there are all the titles of early Romance\r\nitself at your disposal--'Theagenes and Chariclea,' or 'The Ass' of\r\nLongus, or 'The Golden Ass' of Apuleius, or the titles of Gothic\r\nRomance, such as 'The most elegant, delicious, mellifluous, and\r\ndelightful History of Perceforest, King of Great Britain.'\"--And\r\ntherewith my father ran over a list of names as long as the Directory,\r\nand about as amusing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to my taste,\" said my mother, \"the novels I used to read when a\r\ngirl (for I have not read many since, I am ashamed to say),--\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"No, you need not be at all ashamed of it, Kitty.\"\r\n\r\n_My Mother_, proceeding.--\"Were much more inviting than any you mention,\r\nAustin.\"\r\n\r\n_The Captain._--\"True.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Squills._--\"Certainly. Nothing like them now-a-days!\"\r\n\r\n_My Mother._--\"_'Says she to her Neighbor, What?'_\"\r\n\r\n_The Captain._-\"_'The Unknown, or the Northern Gallery'_--\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Squills._--\"_'There is a Secret; Find it Out!'_\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, pushed to the verge of human endurance, and upsetting\r\ntongs, poker, and fire-shovel.--\"What nonsense you are talking, all of\r\nyou! For heaven's sake, consider what an important matter we are called\r\nupon to decide. It is not now the titles of those very respectable works\r\nwhich issued from the Minerva Press that I ask you to remember--it is to\r\ninvent a title for mine--My Novel!\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, clapping his hands gently.--\"Excellent--capital! Nothing\r\ncan be better; simple, natural, pertinent, concise--\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus._--\"What is it, sir--what is it! Have you really thought of\r\na title to My Novel?\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"You have hit it yourself--'My Novel.' It is your\r\nNovel--people will know it is your Novel. Turn and twist the English\r\nlanguage as you will--be as allegorical as Hebrew, Greek,\r\nRoman--Fabulist or Puritan--still, after all, it is your Novel, and\r\nnothing more nor less than your Novel.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, thoughtfully, and sounding the words various ways.--\"'My\r\nNovel'--um--um! 'My Novel!' rather bald--and curt, eh?\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"Add what you say you intend it to depict--Varieties in\r\nEnglish Life.\"\r\n\r\n_My Mother._--\"_'My Novel; or, Varieties in English Life'_--I don't\r\nthink it sounds amiss. What say you, Roland? Would it attract you in a\r\ncatalogue?\"\r\n\r\nMy Uncle hesitates, when Mr. Caxton exclaims imperiously:\r\n\r\n\"The thing is settled! Don't disturb Camarina.\"\r\n\r\n_Squills._--\"If it be not too great a liberty, pray who or what is\r\nCamarina?\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"Camarina, Mr. Squills, was a lake, apt to be low, and\r\nthen liable to be muddy; and 'Don't disturb Camarina' was a Greek\r\nproverb derived from an Oracle of Apollo; and from that Greek proverb,\r\nno doubt, comes the origin of the injunction, '_Quieta non movere_,'\r\nwhich became the favorite maxim of Sir Robert Walpole and Parson Dale.\r\nThe Greek line, Mr. Squills (here my father's memory began to warm), is\r\npreserved by _Stephanus Byzantinus_, de _Urbibus_--\r\n\r\n[Greek: 'Me kinei Kamarinan akinetos gar ameinon.']\r\n\r\n_Zenobius_ explains it in his Proverbs; _Suidas_ repeats _Zenobius_;\r\n_Lucian_ alludes to it; so does _Virgil_ in the Third Book of the\r\n_AEneid_; and _Silius Italicus_ imitates Virgil--\r\n\r\n    'Et cui non licitum fatis Camarina moveri.'\r\n\r\nParson Dale, as a clergyman and a scholar, had, no doubt, these\r\nauthorities at his fingers' end. And I wonder he did not quote them,\"\r\nquoth my father; \"but, to be sure, he is represented as a mild man, and\r\nso might not wish to humble the Squire over much in the presence of his\r\nfamily. Meanwhile, My Novel is My Novel; and now that that matter is\r\nsettled, perhaps the tongs, poker, and shovel may be picked up, the\r\nchildren may go to bed, Blanche and Kitty may speculate apart upon the\r\nfuture dignities of the Neogilos, taking care, nevertheless, to finish\r\nthe new pinbefores he requires for the present; Roland may cast up his\r\naccount-book, Mr. Squills have his brandy and water, and all the world\r\nbe comfortable, each in his own way. Blanche, come away from the screen,\r\nget me my slippers, and leave Pisistratus to himself. [Greek: Me kinei\r\nKamarinan]--don't disturb Camarina. You see, my dear,\" added my father\r\nkindly, as, after settling himself into his slippers, he detained\r\nBlanche's hand in his own--\"you see, my dear, every house has its\r\nCamarina. Man, who is a lazy animal, is quite content to let it alone;\r\nbut woman, being the more active, bustling, curious creature, is always\r\nfor giving it a sly stir.\"\r\n\r\n_Blanche_, with female dignity.--\"I assure you, that if Pisistratus had\r\nnot called me, I should not have--\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, interrupting her, without lifting his eyes from the book\r\nhe has already taken.--\"Certainly you would not. I am now in the midst\r\nof the great Puseyite Controversy. [Greek: Me kinei Kamarinan]--don't\r\ndisturb Camarina.\"\r\n\r\nA dead silence for half an hour, at the end of which\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, from behind the screen.--\"Blanche, my dear, I want to\r\nconsult you.\"\r\n\r\nBlanche does not stir.\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus._--\"Blanche, I say.\"\r\n\r\nBlanche glances in triumph towards Mr. Caxton.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, laying down his theological tract, and rubbing his\r\nspectacles mournfully.--\"I hear him, child: I hear him. I retract my\r\nvindication of Man. Oracles warn in vain: so long as there is a woman on\r\nthe other side of the screen,--it is all up with Camarina!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Stirn was not present at the\r\nParson's Discourse--but that valuable functionary was far otherwise\r\nengaged--indeed, during the summer months he was rarely seen at the\r\nafternoon service. Not that he cared for being preached at--not he: Mr.\r\nStirn would have snapped his finger at the thunders of the Vatican. But\r\nthe fact was, that Mr. Stirn chose to do a great deal of gratuitous\r\nbusiness upon the day of rest. The Squire allowed all persons, who\r\nchose, to walk about the park on a Sunday; and many came from a distance\r\nto stroll by the lake, or recline under the elms. These visitors were\r\nobjects of great suspicion, nay, of positive annoyance, to Mr.\r\nStirn--and, indeed, not altogether without reason, for we English have a\r\nnatural love of liberty, which we are even more apt to display in the\r\ngrounds of other people than in those which we cultivate ourselves.\r\nSometimes, to his inexpressible and fierce satisfaction, Mr. Stirn fell\r\nupon a knot of boys pelting the swans; sometimes he missed a young\r\nsapling, and found it in felonious hands, converted into a\r\nwalking-stick: sometimes he caught a hulking fellow scrambling up the\r\nha-ha! to gather a nosegay for his sweetheart from one of poor Mrs.\r\nHazeldean's pet parterres; not unfrequently, indeed, when all the family\r\nwere fairly at church, some curious impertinents forced or sneaked their\r\nway into the gardens, in order to peep in at the windows. For these, and\r\nvarious other offences of like magnitude, Mr. Stirn had long, but\r\nvainly, sought to induce the Squire to withdraw a permission so\r\nvillanously abused. But though there were times when Mr. Hazeldean\r\ngrunted and growled, and swore \"that he would shut up the park, and fill\r\nit (illegally) with man-traps and spring-guns,\" his anger always\r\nevaporated in words. The park was still open to all the world on a\r\nSunday; and that blessed day was therefore converted into a day of\r\ntravail and wrath to Mr. Stirn. But it was from the last chime of the\r\nafternoon service bell until dusk that the spirit of this vigilant\r\nfunctionary was most perturbed; for, amidst the flocks that gathered\r\nfrom the little hamlets round to the voice of the Pastor, there were\r\nalways some stray sheep, or rather climbing desultory vagabond goats,\r\nwho struck off in all perverse directions, as if for the special purpose\r\nof distracting the energetic watchfulness of Mr. Stirn. As soon as\r\nchurch was over, if the day were fine, the whole park became a scene\r\nanimated with red cloaks, or lively shawls, Sunday waistcoats, and hats\r\nstuck full of wildflowers--which last Mr. Stirn often stoutly maintained\r\nto be Mrs. Hazeldean's newest geraniums. Now, on this Sunday especially,\r\nthere was an imperative call upon an extra exertion of vigilance on the\r\npart of the superintendent--he had not only to detect ordinary\r\ndepredators and trespassers; but, first, to discover the authors of the\r\nconspiracy against the stocks; and secondly, to \"make an example.\"\r\n\r\nHe had begun his rounds, therefore, from early in the morning; and just\r\nas the afternoon bell was sounding its final peal, he emerged upon the\r\nvillage green from a hedgerow, behind which he had been at watch to\r\nobserve who had the most suspiciously gathered round the stocks. At that\r\nmoment the palace was deserted. At a distance, the superintendent saw\r\nthe fast disappearing forms of some belated groups hastening towards the\r\nchurch; in front, the stocks stood staring at him mournfully from its\r\nfour great eyes, which had been cleansed from the mud, but still looked\r\nbleared and stained with the marks of the recent outrage. Here Mr. Stirn\r\npaused, took off his hat, and wiped his brows.\r\n\r\n\"If I had sum un, to watch here,\" thought he, \"while I takes a turn by\r\nthe water-side, praps summat might come out; praps them as did it ben't\r\ngone to church, but will come sneaking round to look on their willainy!\r\nas they says murderers are alway led back to the place where they ha'\r\nleft the body. But in this here willage there ben't a man, woman, nor\r\nchild, as has any consarn for Squire or Parish, barring myself.\" It was\r\njust as he arrived at that misanthropical conclusion that Mr. Stirn\r\nbeheld Leonard Fairfield walking very fast from his own home. The\r\nsuperintendent clapped on his hat, and stuck his right arm akimbo.\r\n\"Hollo, you sir,\" said he, as Lenny now came in hearing, \"where be you\r\ngoing at that rate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, I be going to church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, sir--stop, Master Lenny. Going to church!--why, the bell's done;\r\nand you knows the Parson is very angry at them as comes in late,\r\ndisturbing the congregation. You can't go to church now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir\"--\r\n\r\n\"I says you can't go to church now. You must learn to think a little of\r\nothers, lad. You sees how I sweats to serve the Squire! and you must\r\nserve him too. Why, your mother's got the house and premishes almost\r\nrent-free: you ought to have a grateful heart, Leonard Fairfield, and\r\nfeel for his honor! Poor man! _his_ heart is well-nigh bruk, I'm sure,\r\nwith the goings on.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard opened his innocent blue eyes, while Mr. Stirn dolorously wiped\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that ere dumb cretur,\" said Stirn, suddenly, pointing to the\r\nstocks--\"look at it. If it could speak, what would it say, Leonard\r\nFairfield? Answer me that!--'Damn the stocks, indeed!'\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very bad in them to write such naughty words,\" said Lenny,\r\ngravely. \"Mother was quite shocked when she heard of it, this morning.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stirn._--\"I dare say she was, considering what she pays for the\r\npremishes: (insinuatingly,) you does not know who did it--eh, Lenny?\"\r\n\r\n_Lenny._--\"No, sir: indeed I does not!\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stirn._--\"Well, you see, you can't go to church--prayers half over\r\nby this time. You recollex that I put them stocks under your\r\n'sponsibility,' and see the way you's done your duty by 'em. I've half a\r\nmind to\"--\r\n\r\nMr. Stirn cast his eyes on the eyes of the stocks.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" began Lenny again, rather frightened.\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't please; it ben't pleasing at all. But I forgives you this\r\ntime, only keep a sharp look-out, lad, in future. Now you just stay\r\nhere--no, there--under the hedge, and you watches if any person comes to\r\nloiter about or looks at the stocks, or laughs to hisself, while I go my\r\nrounds. I shall be back either afore church is over or just arter; so\r\nyou stay till I comes, and give me your report. Be sharp, boy, or it\r\nwill be worse for you and your mother; I can let the premishes for four\r\npounds a year more, to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nConcluding with that somewhat menacing and very significant remark, and\r\nnot staying for an answer, Mr. Stirn waved his hand, and walked off.\r\n\r\nPoor Lenny remained by the stocks, very much dejected, and greatly\r\ndisliking the neighborhood to which he was consigned. At length he\r\nslowly crept off to the hedge, and sat himself down in the place of\r\nespionage pointed out to him. Now, philosophers tell us that what is\r\ncalled the point of honor is a barbarous feudal prejudice. Amongst the\r\nhigher classes, wherein those feudal prejudices may be supposed to\r\nprevail, Lenny Fairfield's occupation would not have been considered\r\npeculiarly honorable; neither would it have seemed so to the more\r\nturbulent spirits among the humbler orders, who have a point of honor of\r\ntheir own, which consists in the adherence to each other in defiance of\r\nall lawful authority. But to Lenny Fairfield, brought up much apart from\r\nother boys, and with a profound and grateful reverence for the Squire\r\ninstilled into all his habits of thought, notions of honor bounded\r\nthemselves to simple honesty and straightforward truth; and as he\r\ncherished an unquestioning awe of order and constitutional authority, so\r\nit did not appear to him that there was any thing derogatory and\r\ndebasing in being thus set to watch for an offender. On the contrary, as\r\nhe began to reconcile himself to the loss of the church service, and to\r\nenjoy the cool of the summer shade, and the occasional chirp of the\r\nbirds, he got to look on the bright side of the commission to which he\r\nwas deputed. In youth, at least, every thing has its bright side--even\r\nthe appointment of Protector to the Parish Stocks. For the stocks,\r\nthemselves, Leonard had no affection, it is true; but he had no sympathy\r\nwith their aggressors, and he could well conceive that the Squire would\r\nbe very much hurt at the revolutionary event of the night. \"So,\" thought\r\npoor Leonard in his simple heart--\"so if I can serve his honor, by\r\nkeeping off mischievous boys, or letting him know who did the thing, I'm\r\nsure it would be a proud day for mother.\" Then he began to consider\r\nthat, however ungraciously Mr. Stirn had bestowed on him the\r\nappointment, still it was a compliment to him--showed trust and\r\nconfidence in him, picked him out from his contemporaries as the sober\r\nmoral pattern boy; and Lenny had a great deal of pride in him,\r\nespecially in matters of repute and character.\r\n\r\nAll these things considered, I say, Leonard Fairfield reclined in his\r\nlurking-place, if not with positive delight and intoxicating rapture, at\r\nleast with tolerable content and some complacency.\r\n\r\nMr. Stirn might have been gone a quarter of an hour, when a boy came\r\nthrough a little gate in the park, just opposite to Lenny's retreat in\r\nthe hedge, and, as if fatigued with walking, or oppressed by the heat of\r\nthe day, paused on the green for a moment or so, and then advanced under\r\nthe shade of the great tree which overhung the stocks.\r\n\r\nLenny pricked up his ears, and peeped out jealously.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen the boy before: it was a strange face to him.\r\n\r\nLeonard Fairfield was not fond of strangers; moreover, he had a vague\r\nbelief that strangers were at the bottom of that desecration of the\r\nstocks. The boy, then, was a stranger; but what was his rank? Was he of\r\nthat grade in society in which the natural offences are or are not\r\nconsonant to, or harmonious with, outrages upon stocks? On that Lenny\r\nFairfield did not feel quite assured. According to all the experience of\r\nthe villager, the boy was not dressed like a young gentleman. Leonard's\r\nnotions of such aristocratic costume were naturally fashioned upon the\r\nmodel of Frank Hazeldean. They represented to him a dazzling vision of\r\nsnow-white trowsers, and beautiful blue coats, and incomparable cravats.\r\nNow the dress of this stranger, though not that of a peasant nor of a\r\nfarmer, did not in any way correspond with Lenny's notions of the\r\ncostume of a young gentleman: it looked to him highly disreputable; the\r\ncoat was covered with mud, and the hat was all manner of shapes, with a\r\ngap between the side and crown.\r\n\r\nLenny was puzzled, till it suddenly occurred to him that the gate\r\nthrough which the boy had passed was in the direct path across the park\r\nfrom a small town, the inhabitants of which were in very bad odor at the\r\nHall--they had immemorially furnished the most daring poachers to the\r\npreserves, the most troublesome trespassers on the park, the most\r\nunprincipled orchard-robbers, and the most disputatious assertors of\r\nvarious problematical rights of way, which, according to the town, were\r\npublic, and, according to the Hall, had been private since the Conquest.\r\nIt was true that the same path led also directly from the Squire's\r\nhouse, but it was not probable that the wearer of attire so equivocal\r\nhad been visiting there. All things considered, Lenny had no doubt in\r\nhis mind but that the stranger was a shopboy or 'prentice from the town\r\nof Thorndyke; and the notorious repute of that town, coupled with this\r\npresumption, made it probable that Lenny now saw before him one of the\r\nmidnight desecrators of the stocks. As if to confirm the suspicion,\r\nwhich passed through Lenny's mind with a rapidity wholly\r\ndisproportionate to the number of lines it costs me to convey it, the\r\nboy, now standing right before the stocks, bent down and read that pithy\r\nanathema with which it was defaced. And having read it, he repeated it\r\naloud, and Lenny actually saw him smile--such a smile!--so disagreeable\r\nand sinister! Lenny had never before seen the smile sardonic.\r\n\r\nBut what were Lenny's pious horror and dismay when this ominous stranger\r\nfairly seated himself on the stocks, rested his heels profanely on the\r\nlids of two of the four round eyes, and, taking out a pencil and a\r\npocketbook, began to write. Was this audacious unknown taking an\r\ninventory of the church and the Hall for the purposes of conflagration?\r\nHe looked at one, and at the other, with a strange, fixed stare, as he\r\nwrote--not keeping his eyes on the paper, as Lenny had been taught to do\r\nwhen he sat down to his copybook. The fact is, that Randal Leslie was\r\ntired and faint, and he felt the shock of his fall the more, after the\r\nfew paces he had walked, so that he was glad to rest himself a few\r\nmoments; and he took that opportunity to write a line to Frank, to\r\nexcuse himself for not calling again, intending to tear the leaf on\r\nwhich he wrote out of his pocketbook, and leave it at the first cottage\r\nhe passed, with instructions to take it to the Hall.\r\n\r\nWhile Randal was thus innocently engaged, Lenny came up to him with the\r\nfirm and measured pace of one who has resolved, cost what it may, to do\r\nhis duty. And as Lenny, though brave, was not ferocious, so the anger he\r\nfelt, and the suspicions he entertained, only exhibited themselves in\r\nthe following solemn appeal to the offender's sense of propriety,--\r\n\r\n\"Ben't you ashamed of yourself? Sitting on the Squire's new stocks! Do\r\nget up, and go along with you!\"\r\n\r\nRandal turned round sharply; and though, at any other moment, he would\r\nhave had sense enough to extricate himself very easily from his false\r\nposition, yet, _Nemo mortalium_, &c. No one is always wise. And Randal\r\nwas in an exceedingly bad humor. The affability towards his inferiors,\r\nfor which I lately praised him, was entirely lost in the contempt for\r\nimpertinent snobs natural to an insulted Etonian.\r\n\r\nTherefore, eyeing Lenny with great disdain, Randal answered briefly,--\r\n\r\n\"You are an insolent young blackguard.\"\r\n\r\nSo curt a rejoinder made Lenny's blood fly to his face. Persuaded before\r\nthat the intruder was some lawless apprentice or shop lad, he was now\r\nmore confirmed in that judgment, not only by language so uncivil, but by\r\nthe truculent glance which accompanied it, and which certainly did not\r\nderive any imposing dignity from the mutilated, rakish, hang-dog,\r\nruinous hat, under which it shot its sullen and menacing fire.\r\n\r\nOf all the various articles of which our male attire is composed, there\r\nis perhaps not one which has so much character and expression as the\r\ntop-covering. A neat, well-brushed, short-napped, gentlemanlike hat, put\r\non with a certain air, gives a distinction and respectability to the\r\nwhole exterior; whereas, a broken, squashed, higgledy-piggledy sort of a\r\nhat, such as Randal Leslie had on, would go far towards transforming the\r\nstateliest gentleman that ever walked down St. James's Street into the\r\nideal of a ruffianly scamp.\r\n\r\nNow, it is well known that there is nothing more antipathetic to your\r\npeasant-boy than your shopboy. Even on grand political occasions, the\r\nrural working-class can rarely be coaxed into sympathy with the trading\r\ntown-class. Your true English peasant is always an aristocrat. Moreover,\r\nand irrespectively of this immemorial grudge of class, there is\r\nsomething peculiarly hostile in the relationship between boy and boy\r\nwhen their backs are once up, and they are alone on a quiet bit of\r\ngreen. Something of the game-cock feeling--something that tends to keep\r\nalive, in the population of this island, (otherwise so lamblike and\r\npeaceful,) the martial propensity to double the thumb tightly over the\r\nfour fingers, and make what is called \"a fist of it.\" Dangerous symptoms\r\nof these mingled and aggressive sentiments were visible in Lenny\r\nFairfield at the words and the look of the unprepossessing stranger. And\r\nthe stranger seemed aware of them; for his pale face grew more pale, and\r\nhis sullen eye more fixed and more vigilant.\r\n\r\n\"You get off them stocks,\" said Lenny, disdaining to reply to the coarse\r\nexpressions bestowed on him; and, suiting the action to the word, he\r\ngave the intruder what he meant for a shove, but which Randal took for a\r\nblow. The Etonian sprang up, and the quickness of his movement, aided\r\nbut by a slight touch of his hand, made Lenny lose his balance, and sent\r\nhim neck-and-crop over the stocks. Burning with rage, the young villager\r\nrose alertly, and, flying at Randal, struck out right and left.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAid me, O ye Nine! whom the incomparable Persius satirized his\r\ncontemporaries for invoking, and then, all of a sudden, invoked on his\r\nown behalf--aid me to describe that famous battle by the stocks, and in\r\ndefence of the stocks, which was waged by the two representatives of\r\nSaxon and Norman England. Here, sober support of law and duty and\r\ndelegated trust--_pro aris et focis_; there, haughty invasion, and\r\nbellicose spirit of knighthood, and that respect for name and person,\r\nwhich we call honor. Here, too, hardy physical force--there, skilful\r\ndiscipline. Here----the Nine are as deaf as a post, and as cold as a\r\nstone! Plague take the jades!--I can do better without them.\r\n\r\nRandal was a year older than Lenny, but he was not so tall nor so\r\nstrong, nor even so active; and after the first blind rush, when the two\r\nboys paused, and drew back to breathe, Lenny, eyeing the slight form and\r\nhueless cheek of his opponent, and seeing blood trickling from Randal's\r\nlip, was seized with an instantaneous and generous remorse. \"It was not\r\nfair,\" he thought, \"to fight one whom he could beat so easily.\" So,\r\nretreating still farther, and letting his arms fall to his side, he said\r\nmildly--\"There, let's have no more of it; but go home, and be good.\"\r\n\r\nRandal Leslie had no remarkable degree of that constitutional quality\r\ncalled physical courage; but he had all those moral qualities which\r\nsupply its place. He was proud--he was vindictive--he had high\r\nself-esteem--he had the destructive organ more than the combative;--what\r\nhad once provoked his wrath it became his instinct to sweep away.\r\nTherefore, though all his nerves were quivering, and hot tears were in\r\nhis eyes, he approached Lenny with the sternness of a gladiator, and\r\nsaid between his teeth, which he set hard, choking back the sob of rage\r\nand pain--\r\n\r\n\"You have struck me--and you shall not stir from this ground--till I\r\nhave made you repent it. Put up your hands--I will not strike you\r\nso--defend yourself.\"\r\n\r\nLenny mechanically obeyed; and he had good need of the admonition; for\r\nif before he had had the advantage, now that Randal had recovered the\r\nsurprise to his nerves, the battle was not to the strong.\r\n\r\nThough Leslie had not been a fighting boy at Eton, still his temper had\r\ninvolved him in some conflicts when he was in the lower forms, and he\r\nhad learned something of the art as well as the practice in pugilism--an\r\nexcellent thing, too, I am barbarous enough to believe, and which I hope\r\nwill never quite die out of our public schools. Ah, many a young duke\r\nhas been a better fellow for life from a fair set-to with a trader's\r\nson; and many a trader's son has learned to look a lord more manfully in\r\nthe face on the hustings, from the recollection of the sound thrashing\r\nhe once gave to some little Lord Leopold Dawdle.\r\n\r\nSo Randal now brought his experience and art to bear; put aside those\r\nheavy roundabout blows, and darted in his own, quick and\r\nsharp--supplying the due momentum of pugilistic mechanics to the natural\r\nfeebleness of his arm. Ay, and the arm, too, was no longer so feeble: so\r\nstrange is the strength that comes from passion and pluck!\r\n\r\nPoor Lenny, who had never fought before, was bewildered; his sensations\r\ngrew so entangled that he could never recall them distinctly: he had a\r\ndim reminiscence of some breathless impotent rush--of a sudden blindness\r\nfollowed by quick flashes of intolerable light--of a deadly faintness,\r\nfrom which he was roused by sharp pangs--here--there--everywhere; and\r\nthen all he could remember was, that he was lying on the ground, huddled\r\nup and panting hard, while his adversary bent over him with a\r\ncountenance as dark and livid as Lara himself might have bent over the\r\nfallen Otho. For Randal Leslie was not one who, by impulse and nature,\r\nsubscribed to the noble English maxim--\"Never hit a foe when he is\r\ndown;\" and it cost him a strong if brief self-struggle, not to set his\r\nheel on that prostrate form. It was the mind, not the heart that subdued\r\nthe savage within him, as, muttering something inwardly--certainly not\r\nChristian forgiveness--the victor turned gloomily away.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nJust at that precise moment, who should appear but Mr. Stirn! For, in\r\nfact, being extremely anxious to get Lenny into disgrace, he had hoped\r\nthat he should have found the young villager had shirked the commission\r\nintrusted to him; and the Right-hand Man had slily come back, to see if\r\nthat amiable expectation were realized. He now beheld Lenny rising with\r\nsome difficulty--still panting hard--and with hysterical sounds akin to\r\nwhat is vulgarly called blubbering--his fine new waistcoat sprinkled\r\nwith his own blood which flowed from his nose--nose that seemed to Lenny\r\nFairfield's feelings to be a nose no more, but a swollen, gigantic,\r\nmountainous Slawkenbergian excrescence,--in fact, he felt all nose!\r\nTurning aghast from this spectacle, Mr. Stirn surveyed, with no more\r\nrespect than Lenny had manifested, the stranger boy, who had again\r\nseated himself on the stocks (whether to recover his breath, or whether\r\nto show that his victory was consummated, and that he was in his rights\r\nof possession). \"Hollo,\" said Mr. Stirn, \"what is all this?--what's the\r\nmatter, Lenny, you blockhead?\"\r\n\r\n\"He _will_ sit there,\" answered Lenny, in broken gasps, \"and he has beat\r\nme because I would not let him; but I doesn't mind that,\" added the\r\nvillager, trying hard to suppress his tears, \"and I'm ready again for\r\nhim--that I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you do, lolloping there on them blessed stocks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Looking at the landscape; out of my light, man.\"\r\n\r\nThis tone instantly inspired Mr. Stirn with misgivings: it was a tone so\r\ndisrespectful to him that he was seized with involuntary respect: who\r\nbut a gentleman could speak so to Mr. Stirn?\r\n\r\n\"And may I ask who you be?\" said Stirn, falteringly, and half inclined\r\nto touch his hat. \"What's your name, pray, and what's your bizness?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Randal Leslie, and my business was to visit your master's\r\nfamily--that is, if you are, as I guess from your manner, Mr.\r\nHazeldean's ploughman!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Randal rose; and moving on a few paces, turned, and throwing\r\nhalf-a-crown on the road, said to Lenny,--\"Let that pay you for your\r\nbruises, and remember another time how you speak to a gentleman. As for\r\nyou, fellow,\"--and he pointed his scornful hand towards Mr. Stirn, who,\r\nwith his mouth open, and his hat now fairly off, stood bowing to the\r\nearth--\"as for you, give my compliment to Mr. Hazeldean, and say that,\r\nwhen he does us the honor to visit us at Rood Hall, I trust that the\r\nmanners of our villagers will make him ashamed of Hazeldean.\"\r\n\r\nO my poor Squire! Rood Hall ashamed of Hazeldean! If that message had\r\never been delivered to you, you would never have looked up again!\r\n\r\nWith those bitter words, Randal swung himself over the stile that led\r\ninto the parson's glebe, and left Lenny Fairfield still feeling his\r\nnose, and Mr. Stirn still bowing to the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nRandal Leslie had a very long walk home: he was bruised: and sore from\r\nhead to foot, and his mind was still more sore and more bruised than his\r\nbody. But if Randal Leslie had rested himself in the Squire's gardens,\r\nwithout walking backwards, and indulging in speculations suggested by\r\nMarat, and warranted by my Lord Bacon, he would have passed a most\r\nagreeable evening, and really availed himself of the Squire's wealth by\r\ngoing home in the Squire's carriage. But because he chose to take so\r\nintellectual a view of property, he tumbled into a ditch; because he\r\ntumbled into a ditch, he spoiled his clothes; because he spoiled his\r\nclothes, he gave up his visit; because he gave up his visit, he got into\r\nthe village green, and sat on the stocks with a hat that gave him the\r\nair of a fugitive from the treadmill; because he sat on the stocks--with\r\nthat hat, and a cross face under it--he had been forced into the most\r\ndiscreditable squabble with a clodhopper, and was now limping home, at\r\nwar with gods and men;--_ergo_, (this is a moral that will bear\r\nrepetition)--_ergo_, when you walk in a rich man's grounds, be contented\r\nto enjoy what is yours, namely, the prospect;--I dare say you will enjoy\r\nit more than he does.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nIf, in the simplicity of his heart, and the crudeness of his experience,\r\nLenny Fairfield had conceived it probable that Mr. Stirn would address\r\nto him some words in approbation of his gallantly, and in sympathy for\r\nhis bruises, he soon found himself wofully mistaken. That truly great\r\nman, worthy prime-minister of Hazeldean, might, perhaps, pardon a\r\ndereliction from his orders, if such dereliction proved advantageous to\r\nthe interests of the service, or redounded to the credit of the chief;\r\nbut he was inexorable to that worst of diplomatic offences--an\r\nill-timed, stupid, over-zealous obedience to orders, which, if it\r\nestablished the devotion of the _employe_, got the employer into what is\r\npopularly called a scrape! And though, by those unversed in the\r\nintricacies of the human heart, and unacquainted with the especial\r\nhearts of prime-ministers and right-hand men, it might have seemed\r\nnatural that Mr. Stirn, as he stood still, hat in hand, in the middle of\r\nthe road, stung, humbled, and exasperated by the mortification he had\r\nreceived from the lips of Randal Leslie, would have felt that that young\r\ngentleman was the proper object of his resentment; yet such a breach of\r\nall the etiquette of diplomatic life as resentment towards a superior\r\npower was the last idea that would have suggested itself to the profound\r\nintellect of the Premier of Hazeldean. Still, as rage, like steam, must\r\nescape somewhere, Mr. Stirn, on feeling--as he afterwards expressed it\r\nto his wife--that his \"buzzom was a burstin,\" turned with the natural\r\ninstinct of self-preservation to the safety-valve provided for the\r\nexplosion; and the vapors within him rushed into vent upon Lenny\r\nFairfield. He clapped his hat on his head fiercely, and thus relieved\r\nhis \"buzzom.\"\r\n\r\n\"You young willain! you howdacious wiper! and so all this blessed\r\nSabbath afternoon, when you ought to have been in church on your marrow\r\nbones, a-praying for your betters, you has been a-fitting with a young\r\ngentleman, and a wisiter to your master, on the werry place of the\r\nparridge hinstitution that you was to guard and pertect; and a-bloodying\r\nit all over, I declares, with your blaggard little nose!\" Thus saying,\r\nand as if to mend the matter, Mr. Stirn aimed an additional stroke at\r\nthe offending member; but, Lenny mechanically putting up both his arms\r\nto defend his face, Mr. Stirn struck his knuckles against the large\r\nbrass buttons that adorned the cuff of the boy's coat-sleeve--an\r\nincident which greatly aggravated his indignation. And Lenny, whose\r\nspirit was fairly roused at what the narrowness of his education\r\nconceived to be a signal injustice, placing the trunk of the tree\r\nbetween Mr. Stirn and himself, began that task of self-justification\r\nwhich it was equally impolitic to conceive and imprudent to execute,\r\nsince, in such a case, to justify was to recriminate.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder at you, Master Stirn,--if mother could hear you! You know it\r\nwas you who would not let me go to church; it was you who told me to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fit a young gentleman, and break the Sabbath,\" said Mr. Stirn,\r\ninterrupting him with a withering sneer. \"O yes! I told you to disgrace\r\nhis honor the Squire, and me, and the parridge, and bring us all into\r\ntrouble. But the Squire told me to make an example, and I will!\" With\r\nthose words, quick as lightning flashed upon Mr. Stirn's mind the\r\nluminous idea of setting Lenny in the very stocks which he had too\r\nfaithfully guarded. Eureka! the \"example\" was before him! Here, he could\r\ngratify his long grudge against the pattern boy; here, by such a\r\nselection of the very best lad in the parish, he could strike terror\r\ninto the worst; here, he could appease the offended dignity of Randal\r\nLeslie; here was a practical apology to the Squire for the affront put\r\nupon his young visitor; here, too, there was prompt obedience to the\r\nSquire's own wish that the stocks should be provided as soon as possible\r\nwith a tenant. Suiting the action to the thought, Mr. Stirn made a rapid\r\nplunge at his victim, caught him by the skirt of his jacket, and, in a\r\nfew seconds more, the jaws of the stocks had opened, and Lenny Fairfield\r\nwas thrust therein--a sad spectacle of the reverses of fortune. This\r\ndone, and while the boy was too astounded, too stupefied by the\r\nsuddenness of the calamity for the resistance he might otherwise have\r\nmade--nay, for more than a few inaudible words--Mr. Stirn hurried from\r\nthe spot, but not without first picking up and pocketing the half-crown\r\ndesigned for Lenny, and which, so great had been his first emotions, he\r\nhad hitherto even almost forgotten. He then made his way towards the\r\nchurch, with the intention to place himself close by the door, catch the\r\nSquire as he came out, whisper to him what had passed, and lead him,\r\nwith the whole congregation at his heels, to gaze upon the sacrifice\r\noffered up to the joint powers of Nemesis and Themis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nUnaffectedly I say it--upon the honor of a gentleman, and the reputation\r\nof an author, unaffectedly I say it--no words of mine can do justice to\r\nthe sensations experienced by Lenny Fairfield, as he sat alone in that\r\nplace of penance. He felt no more the physical pain of his bruises; the\r\nanguish of his mind stifled and overbore all corporeal suffering--an\r\nanguish as great as the childish breast is capable of holding. For first\r\nand deepest of all, and earliest felt, was the burning sense of\r\ninjustice. He had, it might be with erring judgment, but with all\r\nhonesty, earnestness, and zeal, executed the commission intrusted to\r\nhim; he had stood forth manfully in discharge of his duty; he had fought\r\nfor it, suffered for it, bled for it. This was his reward! Now, in\r\nLenny's mind there was preeminently that quality which distinguishes the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race--the sense of justice. It was perhaps the strongest\r\nprinciple in his moral constitution; and the principle had never lost\r\nits virgin bloom and freshness by any of the minor acts of oppression\r\nand iniquity which boys of higher birth often suffer from harsh parents,\r\nor in tyrannical schools. So that it was for the first time that that\r\niron entered into his soul, and with it came its attendant feeling--the\r\nwrathful, galling sense of impotence. He had been wronged, and he had no\r\nmeans to right himself. Then came another sensation, if not so deep, yet\r\nmore smarting and envenomed for the time--shame! He, the good boy of all\r\ngood boys--he, the pattern of the school, and the pride of the\r\nParson--he, whom the Squire, in sight of all his contemporaries, had\r\noften singled out to slap on the back, and the grand Squire's lady to\r\npat on the head, with a smiling gratulation on his young and fair\r\nrepute--he, who had already learned so dearly to prize the sweets of an\r\nhonorable name--he, to be made, as it were, in the twinkling of an eye,\r\na mark for opprobrium, a butt of scorn, a jeer, and a byword! The\r\nstreams of his life were poisoned at the fountain. And then came a\r\ntenderer thought of his mother! of the shock this would be to her--she\r\nwho had already begun to look up to him as her stay and support: he\r\nbowed his head, and the tears, long suppressed, rolled down.\r\n\r\nThen he wrestled and struggled, and strove to wrench his limbs from that\r\nhateful bondage;--for he heard steps approaching. And he began to\r\npicture to himself the arrival of all the villagers from church, the\r\nsad gaze of the Parson, the bent brow of the Squire, the idle,\r\nill-suppressed titter of all the boys, jealous of his unblotted\r\ncharacter--character of which the original whiteness could never, never\r\nbe restored! He would always be the boy who had sat in the stocks! And\r\nthe words uttered by the Squire came back on his soul, like the voice of\r\nconscience in the ears of some doomed Macbeth. \"A sad disgrace,\r\nLenny--you'll never be in such a quandary.\" \"Quandary,\" the word was\r\nunfamiliar to him; it must mean something awfully discreditable. The\r\npoor boy could have prayed for the earth to swallow him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\"Kettles and frying-pans! what has us here?\" cried the tinker.\r\n\r\nThis time Mr. Sprott was without his donkey; for, it being Sunday, it is\r\nto be presumed that the donkey was enjoying his Sabbath on the common.\r\nThe tinker was in his Sunday's best, clean and smart, about to take his\r\nlounge in the park.\r\n\r\nLenny Fairfield made no answer to the appeal.\r\n\r\n\"You in the wood, my baby! Well, that's the last sight I should ha'\r\nthought to see. But we all lives to larn,\" said the tinker\r\nsententiously. \"Who gave you them leggins? Can't you speak, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nick Stirn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nick Stirn! Ay, I'd ha' ta'en my davy on that: and cos vy?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause I did as he told me, and fought a boy as was trespassing on\r\nthese very stocks; and he beat me--but I don't care for that; and that\r\nboy was a young gentleman, and going to visit the Squire; and so Nick\r\nStirn--\"\r\n\r\nLenny stopped short, choked by rage and humiliation.\r\n\r\n\"Augh,\" said the tinker, staring, \"you fit with a young gentleman, did\r\nyou? Sorry to hear you confess that, my lad! Sit there, and be thankful\r\nyou ha' got off so cheap. 'Tis salt and battery to fit with your\r\nbetters, and a Lunnon justice o' peace would have given you two months\r\no' the treadmill. But vy should you fit 'cause he trespassed on the\r\nstocks? It ben't your natural side for fitting, I takes it.\"\r\n\r\nLenny murmured something not very distinguishable about serving the\r\nSquire, and doing as he was bid.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I sees, Lenny,\" interrupted the tinker, in a tone of great\r\ncontempt, \"you be one o' those who would rayther 'unt with the 'ounds\r\nthan run with the 'are! You be's the good pattern boy, and would peach\r\nagin your own horder to curry favor with the grand folks. Fie, lad! you\r\nbe sarved right: stick by your horder, then you'll be 'spected when you\r\ngets into trouble, and not be 'varsally 'espised--as you'll be arter\r\nchurch time! Vell, I can't be seen 'sorting with you, now you are in\r\nthis here drogatory fix; it might hurt my cracter, both with them as\r\nbuilt the stocks, and them as wants to pull 'em down. Old kettles to\r\nmend! Vy, you makes me forgit the Sabbath. Sarvent, my lad, and wish you\r\nwell out of it; 'spects to your mother, and say we can deal for the pan\r\nand shovel all the same for your misfortin.\"\r\n\r\nThe tinker went his way. Lenny's eye followed him with the sullenness of\r\ndespair. The tinker, like all the tribe of human comforters, had only\r\nwatered the brambles to invigorate the prick of the thorns. Yes, if\r\nLenny had been caught breaking the stocks, some at least would have\r\npitied him; but to be incarcerated for defending them, you might as well\r\nhave expected that the widows and orphans of the Reign of Terror would\r\nhave pitied Dr. Guillotin when he slid through the grooves of his own\r\ndeadly machine. And even the tinker, itinerant, ragamuffin vagabond as\r\nhe was, felt ashamed to be found with the pattern boy! Lenny's head sank\r\nagain on his breast, heavily as if it had been of lead. Some few minutes\r\nthus passed, when the unhappy prisoner became aware of the presence of\r\nanother spectator to his shame: he heard no step, but he saw a shadow\r\nthrown over the sward. He held his breath, and would not look up, with\r\nsome vague idea that if he refused to see he might escape being seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\"_Per Bacco!_\" said Dr. Riccabocca, putting his hand on Lenny's\r\nshoulder, and bending down to look into his face--\"_Per Bacco!_ my young\r\nfriend, do you sit here from choice or necessity?\"\r\n\r\nLenny slightly shuddered, and winced under the touch of one whom he had\r\nhitherto regarded with a sort of superstitious abhorrence.\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" resumed Riccabocca, after waiting in vain for an answer to his\r\nquestion, \"that, though the situation is charming, you did not select it\r\nyourself. What is this,\"--and the irony of the tone vanished--\"what is\r\nthis, my poor boy? You have been bleeding, and I see that those tears\r\nwhich you try to check come from a deep well. Tell me, _povero fanciullo\r\nmio_, (the sweet Italian vowels, though Lenny did not understand them,\r\nsounded softly and soothingly,)--tell me, my child, how all this\r\nhappened. Perhaps I can help you--we have all erred; we should all help\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\nLenny's heart, that just before had seemed bound in brass, found itself\r\na way as the Italian spoke thus kindly, and the tears rushed down; but\r\nhe again stopped them, and gulped out sturdily,--\r\n\r\n\"I have not done no wrong; it ben't my fault--and 'tis that which kills\r\nme!\" concluded Lenny, with a burst of energy.\r\n\r\n\"You have not done wrong? Then,\" said the philosopher, drawing out his\r\npocket handkerchief with great composure, and spreading it on the\r\nground--\"then I may sit beside you. I could only stoop pityingly over\r\nsin, but can lie down on equal terms with misfortune.\"\r\n\r\nLenny Fairfield did not quite comprehend the words, but enough of their\r\ngeneral meaning was apparent to make him cast a grateful glance on the\r\nItalian. Riccabocca resumed, as he adjusted the pocket-handkerchief, \"I\r\nhave a right to your confidence, my child, for I have been afflicted in\r\nmy day; yet I too say with thee, 'I have not done wrong.' _Cospetto!_\r\n(and here the Doctor seated himself deliberately, resting one arm on\r\nthe side column of the stocks, in familiar contact with the\r\ncaptive's shoulder, while his eye wandered over the lovely scene\r\naround)--_Cospetto!_ my prison, if they had caught me, would not have\r\nhad so fair a look-out as this. But, to be sure, it is all one: there\r\nare no ugly loves, and no handsome prisons!\"\r\n\r\nWith that sententious maxim, which, indeed, he uttered in his native\r\nItalian, Riccabocca turned round, and renewed his soothing invitations\r\nto confidence. A friend in need is a friend indeed, even if he come in\r\nthe guise of a Papist and wizard. All Lenny's ancient dislike to the\r\nforeigner had gone, and he told him his little tale.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca was much too shrewd a man not to see exactly the motives\r\nwhich had induced Mr. Stirn to incarcerate his agent, (barring only that\r\nof personal grudge, to which Lenny's account gave him no clue.) That a\r\nman high in office should make a scape-goat of his own watch-dog for an\r\nunlucky snap, or even an indiscreet bark, was nothing strange to the\r\nwisdom of the student of Machiavelli. However, he set himself to the\r\ntask of consolation with equal philosophy and tenderness. He began by\r\nreminding, or rather informing, Lenny Fairfield of all the instances of\r\nillustrious men afflicted by the injustice of others that occurred to\r\nhis own excellent memory. He told him how the great Epictetus, when in\r\nslavery, had a master whose favorite amusement was pinching his leg,\r\nwhich, as the amusement ended in breaking that limb, was worse than the\r\nstocks. He also told him the anecdote of Lenny's own gallant countryman,\r\nAdmiral Byng, whose execution gave rise to Voltaire's celebrated\r\nwitticism, \"_En Angleterre on tue un amiral pour encourager les\r\nautres._\" (\"In England they execute one admiral in order to encourage\r\nthe others.\") Many more illustrations, still more pertinent to the case\r\nin point, his erudition supplied from the stores of history. But on\r\nseeing that Lenny did not seem in the slightest degree consoled by these\r\nmemorable examples, he shifted his ground, and, reducing his logic to\r\nthe strict _argumentum ad rem_, began to prove, 1st, that there was no\r\ndisgrace at all in Lenny's present position, that every equitable person\r\nwould recognize the tyranny of Stirn and the innocence of its victim;\r\n2dly, that if even here he were mistaken, for public opinion was not\r\nalways righteous, what was public opinion after all?--\"A breath--a\r\npuff,\" cried Dr. Riccabocca--\"a thing without matter--without length,\r\nbreadth, or substance--a shadow--a goblin of our own creating. A man's\r\nown conscience is his sole tribunal, and he should care no more for that\r\nphantom 'opinion' than he should fear meeting a ghost if he cross the\r\nchurchyard at dark.\"\r\n\r\nNow, as Lenny did very much fear meeting a ghost if he crossed the\r\nchurchyard at dark, the simile spoiled the argument, and he shook his\r\nhead very mournfully. Dr. Riccabocca was about to enter into a third\r\ncourse of reasoning, which, had it come to an end, would doubtless have\r\nsettled the matter, and reconciled Lenny to sitting in the stocks till\r\ndoomsday, when the captive, with the quick ear and eye of terror and\r\ncalamity, became conscious that church was over, that the congregation\r\nin a few seconds more would be flocking thitherwards. He saw visionary\r\nhats and bonnets through the trees, which Riccabocca saw not, despite\r\nall the excellence of his spectacles--heard phantasmal rustlings and\r\nmurmurings which Riccabocca heard not, despite all that theoretical\r\nexperience in plots, stratagems, and treasons, which should have made\r\nthe Italian's ear as fine as a conspirator's or a mole's. And, with\r\nanother violent but vain effort at escape, the prisoner exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I could but get out before they come! Let me out--let me out. O,\r\nkind sir, have pity--let me out!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Diavolo!_\" said the philosopher, startled, \"I wonder that never\r\noccurred to me before. After all, I believe he has hit the right nail on\r\nthe head;\" and looking close, he perceived that though the partition\r\nwood had hitched firmly into a sort of spring-clasp, which defied\r\nLenny's unaided struggles, still it was not locked, (for, indeed, the\r\npadlock and key were snug in the justice-room of the Squire, who never\r\ndreamt that his orders would be executed so literally and summarily as\r\nto dispense with all formal appeal to himself.) As soon as Dr.\r\nRiccabocca made that discovery, it occurred to him that all the wisdom\r\nof all the schools that ever existed can't reconcile man or boy to a bad\r\nposition, the moment there is a fair opportunity of letting him out of\r\nit. Accordingly, without more ado, he lifted up the creaking board, and\r\nLenny Fairfield darted forth like a bird from a cage--halted a moment as\r\nif for breath, or in joy; and then, taking at once to his heels, fled,\r\nfast as a hare to its form--fast to his mother's home.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca dropped the yawning wood into its place, picked up his\r\nhandkerchief and restored it to his pocket; and then, with some\r\ncuriosity, began to examine the nature of that place of duresse which\r\nhad caused so much painful emotion to its rescued victim.\r\n\r\n\"Man is a very irrational animal at best,\" quoth the sage,\r\nsoliloquizing, \"and is frightened by strange buggaboos! 'Tis but a piece\r\nof wood! how little it really injures; and, after all, the holes are but\r\nrests to the legs, and keep the feet out of the dirt. And this green\r\nbank to sit upon--under the shade of the elm-tree--verily the position\r\nmust be more pleasant than otherwise! I've a great mind--\" Here the\r\nDoctor looked around, and, seeing the coast still clear, the oddest\r\nnotion imaginable took possession of him; yet not indeed a notion so\r\nodd, considered philosophically--for all philosophy is based on\r\npractical experiment--and Dr. Riccabocca felt an irresistible desire\r\npractically to experience what manner of thing that punishment of the\r\nstocks really was. \"I can but try!--only for a moment,\" said he\r\napologetically to his own expostulating sense of dignity. \"I have time\r\nto do it, before any one comes.\" He lifted up the partition again; but\r\nstocks are built on the true principle of English law, and don't easily\r\nallow a man to criminate himself--it was hard to get into them without\r\nthe help of a friend. However, as we before noticed, obstacles only\r\nwhetted Dr. Riccabocca's invention. He looked round and saw a withered\r\nbit of stick under the tree--this he inserted in the division of the\r\nstocks, somewhat in the manner in which boys place a stick under a sieve\r\nfor the purpose of ensnaring sparrows: the fatal wood thus propped, Dr.\r\nRiccabocca sat gravely down on the bank, and thrust his feet through the\r\napertures.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing in it!\" cried he triumphantly, after a moment's deliberation.\r\n\"The evil is only in idea. Such is the boasted reason of mortals!\" With\r\nthat reflection, nevertheless, he was about to withdraw his feet from\r\ntheir voluntary dilemma, when the crazy stick suddenly gave way, and the\r\npartition fell back into its clasp. Doctor Riccabocca was fairly\r\ncaught--\"_Facitis descensus--sed revocare gradum!_\" True, his hands were\r\nat liberty, but his legs were so long that, being thus fixed, they kept\r\nthe hands from the rescue; and as Dr. Riccabocca's form was by no means\r\nsupple, and the twin parts of the wood stuck together with that firmness\r\nof adhesion which things newly painted possess, so, after some vain\r\ntwists and contortions, in which he succeeded at length (not without a\r\nstretch of the sinews that made them crack again) in finding the clasp\r\nand breaking his nails thereon, the victim of his own rash experiment\r\nresigned himself to his fate. Dr. Riccabocca was one of those men who\r\nnever do things by halves. When I say he resigned himself, I mean not\r\nonly Christian but philosophical resignation. The position was not quite\r\nso pleasant as, theoretically, he had deemed it; but he resolved to make\r\nhimself as comfortable as he could. And first, as is natural in all\r\ntroubles to men who have grown familiar with that odoriferous comforter\r\nwhich Sir Walter Raleigh is said first to have bestowed upon the\r\nCaucasian races, the Doctor made use of his hands to extract from his\r\npocket his pipe, match-box, and tobacco-pouch. After a few whiffs he\r\nwould have been quite reconciled to his situation, but for the discovery\r\nthat the sun had shifted its place in the heavens, and was no longer\r\nshaded from his face by the elm-tree. The Doctor again looked round, and\r\nperceived that his red silk umbrella, which he had laid aside when he\r\nhad seated himself by Lenny, was within arm's reach. Possessing himself\r\nof this treasure, he soon expanded its friendly folds. And thus doubly\r\nfortified within and without, under shade of the umbrella, and his pipe\r\ncomposedly between his lips, Dr. Riccabocca gazed on his own\r\nincarcerated legs, even with complacency.\r\n\r\n\"'He who can despise all things,'\" said he, in one of his native\r\nproverbs, \"'possesses all things'--if one despise freedom, one is free!\r\nThis seat is as soft as a sofa! I am not sure,\" he resumed,\r\nsoliloquizing, after a pause--\"I am not sure that there is not something\r\nmore witty than manly and philosophical in that national proverb of\r\nmine, which I quoted to the _fanciullo_, that there are no handsome\r\nprisons! Did not the son of that celebrated Frenchman, surnamed _Bras de\r\nFer_, write a book not only to prove that adversities are more necessary\r\nthan prosperities, but that among all adversities a prison is the most\r\npleasant and profitable?[32] But is not this condition of mine,\r\nvoluntarily and experimentally incurred, a type of my life? Is it the\r\nfirst time that I have thrust myself into a hobble?--and if in a hobble\r\nof mine own choosing, why should I blame the gods?\"\r\n\r\nUpon this Dr. Riccabocca fell into a train of musing so remote from time\r\nand place, that in a few minutes he no more remembered that he was in\r\nthe parish stocks, than a lover remembers that flesh is grass, a miser\r\nthat mammon is perishable, a philosopher that wisdom is vanity.--Dr.\r\nRiccabocca was in the clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nThe dullest dog that ever wrote a novel (and, _entre nous_, reader--but\r\nlet it go no farther--we have a good many dogs among the fraternity that\r\nare not Munitos[33]) might have seen with half an eye that the Parson's\r\ndiscourse had produced a very genial and humanizing effect upon his\r\naudience. When all was over, and the congregation stood up to let Mr.\r\nHazeldean and his family walk first down the aisle (for that was the\r\ncustom at Hazeldean), moistened eyes glanced at the Squire's sunburned,\r\nmanly face, with a kindness that bespoke revived memory of many a\r\ngenerous benefit and ready service. The head might be wrong now and\r\nthen--the heart was in the right place after all. And the lady, leaning\r\non his arm, came in for a large share of that gracious good feeling.\r\nTrue, she now and then gave a little offence when the cottages were not\r\nso clean as she fancied they ought to be--and poor folks don't like a\r\nliberty taken with their houses any more than the rich do; true, that\r\nshe was not quite so popular with the women as the Squire was, for, if\r\nthe husband went too often to the alehouse, she always laid the fault on\r\nthe wife, and said, \"No man would go out of doors for his comforts, if\r\nhe had a smiling face and a clean hearth at his home;\" whereas the\r\nSquire maintained the more gallant opinion, that \"if Gill was a shrew,\r\nit was because Jack did not, as in duty bound, stop her mouth with a\r\nkiss.\" Still, notwithstanding these more obnoxious notions on her part,\r\nand a certain awe inspired by the stiff silk gown and the handsome\r\naquiline nose, it was impossible, especially in the softened tempers of\r\nthat Sunday afternoon, not to associate the honest, comely, beaming\r\ncountenance of Mrs. Hazeldean with comfortable recollections of soups,\r\njellies, and wine in sickness, loaves and blankets in winter, cheering\r\nwords and ready visits in every little distress, and pretexts afforded\r\nby improvement in the grounds and gardens (improvements which, as the\r\nSquire, who preferred productive labor, justly complained, \"would never\r\nfinish\") for little timely jobs of work to some veteran grandsire, who\r\nstill liked to earn a penny, or some ruddy urchin in a family that \"came\r\ntoo fast.\" Nor was Frank, as he walked a little behind, in the whitest\r\nof trousers and the stiffest of neckcloths--with a look of suppressed\r\nroguery in his bright hazel eye, that contrasted his assumed stateliness\r\nof mien--without his portion of the silent blessing. Not that he had\r\ndone any thing yet to deserve it; but we all give youth so large a\r\ncredit in the future. As for Miss Jemima, her trifling foibles only rose\r\nfrom too soft and feminine a susceptibility, too ivy-like a yearning for\r\nsome masculine oak, whereon to entwine her tendrils; and so little\r\nconfined to self was the natural lovingness of her disposition, that she\r\nhad helped many a village lass to find a husband, by the bribe of a\r\nmarriage gift from her own privy purse; notwithstanding the assurances\r\nwith which she accompanied the marriage gift,--viz., that \"the\r\nbridegroom would turn out like the rest of his ungrateful sex; but that\r\nit was a comfort to think that it would be all one in the approaching\r\ncrash.\" So that she had her warm partisans, especially amongst the\r\nyoung; while the slim Captain, on whose arm she rested her forefinger,\r\nwas at least a civilspoken gentleman, who had never done any harm, and\r\nwho would doubtless do a deal of good if he belonged to the parish. Nay,\r\neven the fat footman, who came last with the family Prayer-book, had his\r\ndue share in the general association of neighborly kindness between hall\r\nand hamlet. Few were there present to whom he had not extended the\r\nright-hand of fellowship, with a full horn of October in the clasp of\r\nit: and he was a Hazeldean man, too, born and bred, as two-thirds of the\r\nSquire's household (now letting themselves out from their large pew\r\nunder the gallery) were.\r\n\r\nOn his part, too, you could see that the Squire was \"moved withal,\" and\r\na little humbled moreover. Instead of walking erect, and taking bow and\r\ncourtesy as matter of course, and of no meaning, he hung his head\r\nsomewhat, and there was a slight blush on his cheek; and as he glanced\r\nupward and round him--shyly, as it were--and his eye met those friendly\r\nlooks, it returned them with an earnestness that had in it something\r\ntouching as well as cordial--an eye that said, as well as eye could say,\r\n\"I don't quite deserve it, I fear, neighbors; but I thank you for your\r\ngood-will with my whole heart.\" And so readily was that glance of the\r\neye understood, that I think, if that scene had taken place out of doors\r\ninstead of in the church, there would have been an hurrah as the Squire\r\npassed out of sight.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Mr. Hazeldean got well out of the churchyard, ere Mr. Stirn\r\nwas whispering in his ear. As Stirn whispered, the Squire's face grew\r\nlong, and his color changed. The congregation, now flocking out of the\r\nchurch, exchanged looks with each other; that ominous conjunction\r\nbetween Squire and man chilled back all the effects of the Parson's\r\nsermon. The Squire struck his cane violently into the ground. \"I would\r\nrather you had told me Black Bess had got the glanders. A young\r\ngentleman, coming to visit my son, struck and insulted in Hazeldean; a\r\nyoung gentleman--'sdeath, sir, a relation--his grandmother was a\r\nHazeldean. I do believe Jemima's right, and the world's coming to an\r\nend! But Leonard Fairfield in the stocks! What will the Parson say? and\r\nafter such a sermon! 'Rich man, respect the poor!' And the good widow,\r\ntoo; and poor Mark, who almost died in my arms. Stirn, you have a heart\r\nof stone! You confounded, lawless, merciless miscreant, who the deuce\r\ngave you the right to imprison man or boy in my parish of Hazeldean\r\nwithout trial, sentence, or warrant? Run and let the boy out before any\r\none sees him: run, or I shall\"--The Squire elevated his cane, and his\r\neyes shot fire. Mr. Stirn did not run, but he walked off very fast. The\r\nSquire drew back a few paces, and again took his wife's arm. \"Just wait\r\na bit for the Parson, while I talk to the congregation. I want to stop\r\n'em all, if I can, from going into the village; but how?\"\r\n\r\nFrank heard, and replied readily--\r\n\r\n\"Give 'em some beer, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beer! on a Sunday! For shame, Frank!\" cried Mrs. Hazeldean.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, Harry. Thank you Frank,\" said the Squire, and his\r\nbrow grew as clear as the blue sky above him. I doubt if Riccabocca\r\ncould have got him out of his dilemma with the same ease as Frank had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"Halt there, my men--lads and lasses too--there, halt a bit. Mrs.\r\nFairfield, do you hear?--halt! I think his reverence has given us a\r\ncapital sermon. Go up to the Great House all of you, and drink a glass\r\nto his health. Frank, go with them; and tell Spruce to tap one of the\r\ncasks kept for the hay-makers. Harry, [this in whisper,] catch the\r\nParson, and tell him to come to me instantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Hazeldean, what has happened? you are mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother--do what I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is the Parson to find you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, gad zooks, Mrs. H.--at the stocks to be sure!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca, awakened out of his reverie by the sound of footsteps,\r\nwas still so little sensible of the indignity of his position, that he\r\nenjoyed exceedingly, and with all the malice of his natural humor, the\r\nastonishment and stupor manifested by Stirn, when that functionary\r\nbeheld the extraordinary substitute which fate and philosophy had found\r\nfor Lenny Fairfield. Instead of the weeping, crushed, broken-hearted\r\ncaptive whom he had reluctantly come to deliver, he stared, speechless\r\nand aghast, upon the grotesque but tranquil figure of the Doctor,\r\nenjoying his pipe and cooling himself under his umbrella, with a\r\n_sang-froid_ that was truly appalling and diabolical. Indeed,\r\nconsidering that Stirn always suspected the Papisher of having had a\r\nhand in the whole of that black and midnight business, in which the\r\nstocks had been broken, bunged up, and consigned to perdition, and that\r\nthe Papisher had the evil reputation of dabbling in the Black Art, the\r\nhocus-pocus way in which the Lenny he had incarcerated was transformed\r\ninto the Doctor he found, conjoined with the peculiarly strange,\r\neldritch, and Mephistophelean physiognomy and person of Riccabocca,\r\ncould not but strike a thrill of superstitious dismay into the breast of\r\nthe parochial tyrant. While to his first confused and stammered\r\nexclamations and interrogatories, Riccabocca replied with so tragic an\r\nair, such ominous shakes of the head, such mysterious, equivocating,\r\nlong-worded sentences, that Stirn every moment felt more and more\r\nconvinced that the boy had sold himself to the Powers of Darkness; and\r\nthat he himself, prematurely, and in the flesh, stood face to face with\r\nthe Arch-Enemy.\r\n\r\nMr. Stirn had not yet recovered his wonted intelligence, which, to do\r\nhim justice, was usually prompt enough--when the Squire, followed hard\r\nby the Parson, arrived at the spot. Indeed, Mrs. Hazeldean's report of\r\nthe Squire's urgent message, disturbed manner, and most unparalleled\r\ninvitation to the parishioners, had given wings to Parson Dale's\r\nordinarily slow and sedate movements. And while the Squire, sharing\r\nStirn's amazement, beheld indeed a great pair of feet projecting from\r\nthe stocks, and saw behind them the grave face of Doctor Riccabocca,\r\nunder the majestic shade of the umbrella, but not a vestige of the only\r\nbeing his mind could identify with the tenancy of the stocks, Mr. Dale,\r\ncatching him by the arm, and panting hard, exclaimed with a petulance he\r\nhad never before been known to display--except at the whist-table:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hazeldean, Mr. Hazeldean, I am scandalized--I am shocked at you. I\r\ncan bear a great deal from you, sir, as I ought to do; but to ask my\r\nwhole congregation, the moment after divine service, to go up and guzzle\r\nale at the Hall, and drink my health, as if a clergyman's sermon had\r\nbeen a speech at a cattle-fair! I am ashamed of you, and of the parish!\r\nWhat on earth has come to you all?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the very question I wish to heaven I could answer,\" groaned the\r\nSquire, quite mildly and pathetically--\"What on earth has come to us\r\nall? Ask Stirn:\" (then bursting out) \"Stirn, you infernal rascal, don't\r\nyou hear?--what on earth has come to us all?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Papisher is at the bottom of it, sir,\" said Stirn, provoked out of\r\nall temper. \"I does my duty, but I is but a mortal man, arter all.\"\r\n\r\n\"A mortal fiddlestick--where's Leonard Fairfield, I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Him_ knows best,\" answered Stirn, retreating mechanically, for\r\nsafety's sake, behind the Parson, and pointing to Dr. Riccabocca.\r\nHitherto, though both the Squire and Parson had indeed recognized the\r\nItalian, they had merely supposed him to be seated on the bank. It never\r\nentered their heads that so respectable and dignified a man could by any\r\npossibility be an inmate, compelled or voluntary, of the parish stocks.\r\nNo, not even though, as I before said, the Squire had seen, just under\r\nhis nose, a very long pair of soles inserted in the apertures--that\r\nsight had only confused and bewildered him, unaccompanied as it ought to\r\nhave been with the trunk and face of Lenny Fairfield. Those soles seemed\r\nto him optical delusions, phantoms of the overheated brain; but now,\r\ncatching hold of Stirn, while the Parson in equal astonishment caught\r\nhold of him--the Squire faltered out, \"Well, this beats cock-fighting!\r\nThe man's as mad as a March hare, and has taken Dr. Rickeybockey for\r\nlittle Lenny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said the Doctor, breaking silence, with a bland smile, and\r\nattempting an inclination of the head as courteous as his position would\r\npermit--\"perhaps, if it be quite the same to you, before you proceed to\r\nexplanations,--you will just help me out of the stocks.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson, despite his perplexity and anger, could not repress a smile,\r\nas he approached his learned friend, and bent down for the purpose of\r\nextricating him.\r\n\r\n\"Lord love your reverence, you'd better not!\" cried Mr. Stirn. \"Don't be\r\ntempted--he only wants to get you into his claws. I would not go a-near\r\nhim for all the--\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was interrupted by Dr. Riccabocca himself, who now, thanks to\r\nthe Parson, had risen into his full height, and half a head taller than\r\nall present--even than the tall Squire--approached Mr. Stirn, with a\r\ngracious wave of the hand. Mr. Stirn retreated rapidly towards the\r\nhedge, amidst the brambles of which he plunged himself incontinently.\r\n\r\n\"I guess whom you take me for, Mr. Stirn,\" said the Italian, lifting his\r\nhat with his characteristic politeness. \"It is certainly a great honor:\r\nbut you will know better one of these days, when the gentleman in\r\nquestion admits you to a personal interview in another and--a hotter\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\"But how on earth did you get into my new stocks?\" asked the Squire,\r\nscratching his head.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, Pliny the elder got into the crater of Mount Etna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he, and what for?\"\r\n\r\n\"To try what it was like, I suppose,\" answered Riccabocca.\r\n\r\nThe Squire burst out a-laughing.\r\n\r\n\"And so you got into the stocks to try what it was like. Well, I can't\r\nwonder--it is a very handsome pair of stocks,\" continued the Squire,\r\nwith a loving look at the object of his praise. \"Nobody need be ashamed\r\nof being seen in those stocks--I should not mind it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better move on,\" said the Parson dryly, \"or we shall be having\r\nthe whole village here presently, gazing on the lord of the manor in the\r\nsame predicament as that from which we have just extricated the Doctor.\r\nNow pray, what is the matter with Lenny Fairfield? I can't understand a\r\nword of what has passed. You don't mean to say that good Lenny Fairfield\r\n(who was absent from church by the by) can have done any thing to get\r\ninto disgrace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has though,\" cried the Squire. \"Stirn, I say--Stirn.\" But Stirn\r\nhad forced his way through the hedge and vanished. Thus left to his own\r\npowers of narrative at second-hand, Mr. Hazeldean now told all he had to\r\ncommunicate: the assault upon Randal Leslie, and the prompt punishment\r\ninflicted by Stirn; his own indignation at the affront to his young\r\nkinsman, and his good-natured merciful desire to save the culprit from\r\nthe addition of public humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe Parson, mollified towards the rude and hasty invention of the\r\nbeer-drinking, took the Squire by the hand. \"Ah, Mr. Hazeldean, forgive\r\nme,\" he said repentantly; \"I ought to have known at once that it was\r\nonly some ebullition of your heart that could stifle your sense of\r\ndecorum. But this is a sad story about Lenny, brawling and fighting on\r\nthe Sabbath-day. So unlike him, too--I don't know what to make of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like or unlike,\" said the Squire, \"it has been a gross insult to young\r\nLeslie; and looks all the worse because I and Audley are not just the\r\nbest friends in the world. I can't think what it is,\" continued Mr.\r\nHazeldean, musingly, \"but it seems that there must be always some\r\nassociation of fighting connected with that prim half-brother of mine.\r\nThere was I, son of his own mother--who might have been shot through the\r\nlungs, only the ball lodged in the shoulder--and now his wife's\r\nkinsman--my kinsman, too--grandmother of a Hazeldean--a hard-reading\r\nsober lad, as I am given to understand, can't set his foot into the\r\nquietest parish in the three kingdoms, but what the mildest boy that\r\never was seen--makes a rush at him like a mad bull. It is FATALITY!\"\r\ncried the Squire solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Ancient legend records similar instances of fatality in certain\r\nhouses,\" observed Riccabocca. \"There was the House of Pelops--and\r\nPolynices and Eteocles--the sons of Oedipus!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw,\" said the Parson; \"but what's to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Done?\" said the Squire; \"why, reparation must be made to young Leslie.\r\nAnd though I wished to spare Lenny, the young ruffian, a public\r\ndisgrace--for your sake, Parson Dale, and Mrs. Fairfield's;--yet a good\r\ncaning in private--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, sir!\" said Riccabocca mildly, \"and hear me.\" The Italian then,\r\nwith much feeling and considerable tact, pleaded the cause of his poor\r\nprotege, and explained how Lenny's error arose only from mistaken zeal\r\nfor the Squire's service, and in the execution of the orders received\r\nfrom Mr. Stirn.\r\n\r\n\"That alters the matter,\" said the Squire, softened; \"and all that is\r\nnecessary now will be for him to make a proper apology to my kinsman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is just,\" rejoined the Parson; \"but I still don't learn how\r\nhe got out of the stocks.\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca then resumed his tale; and, after confessing his own\r\nprincipal share in Lenny's escape, drew a moving picture of the boy's\r\nshame and honest mortification. \"Let us march against Philip!\" cried the\r\nAthenians when they heard Demosthenes--\r\n\r\n\"Let us go at once and comfort the child!\" cried the Parson, before\r\nRiccabocca could finish.\r\n\r\nWith that benevolent intention, all three quickened their pace, and soon\r\narrived at the widow's cottage. But Lenny had caught sight of their\r\napproach through the window; and not doubting that, in spite of\r\nRiccabocca's intercession, the Parson was come to upbraid, and the\r\nSquire to re-imprison, he darted out by the back way, got amongst the\r\nwoods, and lay there _perdu_ all the evening. Nay, it was not till after\r\ndark that his mother--who sat wringing her hands in the little kitchen\r\nand trying in vain to listen to the Parson and Mrs. Dale, who (after\r\nsending in search of the fugitive) had kindly come to console the\r\nmother--heard a timid knock at the door and a nervous fumble at the\r\nlatch. She started up, opened the door, and Lenny sprang to her bosom,\r\nand there buried his face, sobbing loud.\r\n\r\n\"No harm, my boy,\" said the Parson tenderly; \"you have nothing to\r\nfear--all is explained and forgiven.\"\r\n\r\nLenny looked up, and the veins on his forehead were much swollen. \"Sir,\"\r\nsaid he sturdily, \"I don't want to be forgiven--I ain't done no wrong.\r\nAnd--I've been disgraced--and I won't go to school, never no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Carry!\" said the Parson to his wife, who, with the usual\r\nliveliness of her little temper, was about to expostulate. \"Good night,\r\nMrs. Fairfield. I shall come and talk to you to-morrow, Lenny; by that\r\ntime you will think better of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson then conducted his wife home, and went up to the Hall to\r\nreport Lenny's safe return; for the Squire was very uneasy about him,\r\nand had even in person shared the search. As soon as he heard Lenny was\r\nsafe--\"Well,\" said the Squire, \"let him go the first thing in the\r\nmorning to Rood Hall, to ask Master Leslie's pardon, and all will be\r\nright and smooth again.\"\r\n\r\n\"A young villain!\" cried Frank, with his cheeks the color of scarlet;\r\n\"to strike a gentleman and an Etonian, who had just been to call on\r\n_me_! But I wonder Randal let him off so well--any other boy in the\r\nsixth form would have killed him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" said the Parson sternly, \"if we all had our deserts, what\r\nshould be done to him who not only lets the sun go down on his own\r\nwrath, but strives with uncharitable breath to fan the dying embers of\r\nanother's?\"\r\n\r\nThe clergyman here turned away from Frank, who bit his lip, and seemed\r\nabashed--while even his mother said not a word in his exculpation; for\r\nwhen the Parson did reprove in that stern tone, the majesty of the Hall\r\nstood awed before the rebuke of the Church. Catching Riccabocca's\r\ninquisitive eye, Mr. Dale drew aside the philosopher, and whispered to\r\nhim his fears that it would be a very hard matter to induce Lenny to beg\r\nRandal Leslie's pardon, and that the proud stomach of the pattern-boy\r\nwould not digest the stocks with as much ease as a long regimen of\r\nphilosophy had enabled the sage to do. This conference Miss Jemima soon\r\ninterrupted by a direct appeal to the Doctor respecting the number of\r\nyears (even without any previous and more violent incident) that the\r\nworld could possibly withstand its own wear and tear.\r\n\r\n\"Ma'am,\" said the Doctor, reluctantly summoned away to look at a passage\r\nin some prophetic periodical upon that interesting subject--\"ma'am, it\r\nis very hard that you should make one remember the end of the world,\r\nsince, in conversing with you, one's natural temptation is to forget its\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Jemima blushed scarlet.

FAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was passing from my office one day, to indulge myself with a walk,\r\nwhen a little hard-faced old man, with a black coat, broad-brimmed hat,\r\nvelvet breeches, shoes and buckles, and gold-headed cane, stopped me,\r\nstanding directly in my path. I looked at him. He looked at me. I\r\ncrossed my hands before me patiently, forced my features into a civil\r\nsmile, and waited the development of his intentions; not being\r\ndistinctly certain, from his firm, determined expression, whether he was\r\n\"a spirit of health or goblin damned,\" and whether his intents were\r\n\"wicked or charitable\"--that is, whether he came to discontinue or to\r\nsubscribe, to pay a bill or present one, to offer a communication or a\r\npistol, to shake me by the hand, or pull me by the nose. Editors\r\nnow-a-days must always be on their guard. For my part, I am peaceable,\r\nand much attached to life, and should esteem it exceedingly disagreeable\r\nto be either shot, or horsewhipped. I am not built for action, but love\r\nto sail in quiet waters; cordially eschewing gales, waves, water-spouts,\r\nsea-serpents, earthquakes, tornadoes, and all such matters, both on sea\r\nand land. My antipathy to a horsewhip is an inheritance from boyhood. It\r\ncarried me across Caesar's bridge, and through Virgil and Horace. I am\r\nindebted to it for a tolerable understanding of grammar, arithmetic,\r\ngeography, and other occult sciences. It enlightened me not a little\r\nupon many algebraic processes, which, to speak truth, presented,\r\notherwise, but slender claims to my consideration. It disciplined me\r\ninto a uniform propriety of manners, and instilled into my bosom early\r\nrudiments of wisdom, and principles of virtue. In my maturer years, the\r\ncontingencies of life have thrust me rather abruptly, if not\r\nreluctantly, into the editorial fraternity (heaven bless them, I mean\r\nthem no disrespect), and in the same candor which distinguishes my\r\nformer acknowledgments, I confess that visions of this instrument have\r\noccasionally obtruded themselves somewhat forcibly upon my fancy, in the\r\nparoxysms of an article, dampening the glow of composition, and causing\r\ncertain qualifying interlineations and prudent erasures, prompted by the\r\nrepresentations of memory or the whispers of prudence. The reader must\r\nnot fancy, from the form of my expression, that I have ever been\r\nhorsewhipped. I have hitherto escaped, (for which Heaven be praised!)\r\nalthough my horizon has been darkened by many a cloudy threat, and\r\nthundering denunciation.\r\n\r\nNose-pulling is another disagreeable branch of the editorial business.\r\nTo have any part of one pulled is annoying; but there is a dignity about\r\nthe nose impatient even of observation or remark: while the act of\r\ntaking hold of it with the thumb and finger is worse than murder, and\r\ncan only be washed out with blood. Kicking, cuffing, being turned out of\r\ndoors, being abused in the papers, &c., are bad, but these are mere\r\nminor considerations. Indeed, many of my brother editors rather pique\r\nthemselves upon some of them, as a soldier does on the scars obtained in\r\nfighting the battles of his country; they fancy that, thereby, they are\r\ninvested with claims upon their party, and suffer indefinite dreams of\r\npolitical eminence to be awakened in their bosoms. I have seen a fellow\r\ndraw his hat fiercely down over his brow, and strut about, with\r\ninsufferable importance, on the strength of having been thoroughly\r\nkicked by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis is a long digression, but it passed rapidly through my mind as the\r\nlittle, hard-faced old gentleman stood before me, looking at me with a\r\npiercing glance, and a resolute air. At length, unlike a ghost, he spoke\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\"You are the editor?\"--&c.\r\n\r\n\"A slight motion of acquiescence with my head, and an affirmative wave\r\nof my hand, a little leaning toward the majestic, announced to my\r\nunknown friend the accuracy of his conjecture.\"\r\n\r\nThe little old gentleman's face relaxed--he took off his broad-brimmed\r\nhat, and laid it down with his cane carefully on the table, then seized\r\nmy hand and shook it heartily. People are so polite and friendly when\r\nabout to ask a favor.\r\n\r\n\"My dear air,\" said he, \"this is a pleasure I have long sought vainly.\r\nYou must know, sir. I am the editor of a theatrical weekly--a neat thing\r\nin its way--here's the last number.\" He fumbled about in his pocket, and\r\nproduced a red-covered pamphlet.\r\n\r\n\"I have been some time publishing it, and though it is admitted by all\r\nacquainted with its merits to be clearly the best thing of the kind ever\r\nstarted this side of the Atlantic, yet people do not seem to take much\r\nnotice of it. Indeed, my friends tell me that the public are not fully\r\naware of its existence. Pray let me be indebted to you for a notice. I\r\nwish to get fairly afloat. You see I have been too diffident about it.\r\nWe modest fellows allow our inferiors to pass us often. I will leave\r\nthis number with you. Pray, pray give it a good notice.\"\r\n\r\nHe placed in my hands the eleventh number of the \"North American\r\nThespian Magazine,\" devoted to the drama, and also to literature,\r\nscience, history, and the arts. On reading over the prospectus, I found\r\nit vastly comprehensive, embracing pretty much every subject in the\r\nworld. If so extensive a plan were decently filled up in the details,\r\nthe \"North American Thespian Magazine\" was certainly worth the annual\r\nsubscription money, which was only one dollar. I said so under my\r\n\"literary notices\" in the next impression of my journal; and, although I\r\nhad not actually read the work, yet it sparkled so with asterisks,\r\ndashes, and notes of admiration, that it looked interesting. I added in\r\nmy critique, that it was elegantly got up, that its typographical\r\nexecution reflected credit on the publishers, that its failure would be\r\na grievous reproach to the city, that its editor was a scholar, a\r\nwriter, and a gentleman, and was favorably known to the literary circles\r\nby the eloquence, wit, and feeling of his former productions. What those\r\nproductions were, I should have been rather puzzled to say, never having\r\nread, or even heard of them. This, however, was the cant criticism of\r\nthe day, which is so exorbitant and unmeaning, and so universally cast\r\nin one mould, that I was in some tribulation, on reading over the\r\narticle in print, to find that I had omitted the words, \"native genius,\"\r\nwhich possesses a kind of common-law right to a place in all articles on\r\nAmerican literary productions. Forth, however, it went to the world, and\r\nI experienced a philanthropic emotion in fancying how pleased the\r\nlittle, hard-faced old gentleman would be with these flattering\r\nencomiums on his \"Thespian Magazine.\"\r\n\r\nThe very day my paper was out, as I was sitting \"full fathom five\" deep\r\nin an article on \"The Advantages of Virtue\" (an interesting theme, upon\r\nmy views of which I rather flattered myself), I was startled by three\r\nknocks at the door, and my \"Come in\" exhibited to view the broad-brimmed\r\nhat of the hard-faced gentleman, with his breeches, buckles, gold-headed\r\ncane and all. He laid aside his hat and cane with the air of a man who\r\nhas walked a great way, and means to rest himself a while. I was very\r\nbusy. It was one of my inspired moments. Half of a brilliant idea was\r\nalready committed to paper. There it lay--a fragment--a flower cut off\r\nin the bud--a mere outline--an embryo; and my imagination cooling like a\r\npiece of red-hot iron in the open air. I raised my eyes to the old\r\ngentleman, with a look of solemn silence, retaining my pen ready for\r\naction, with my little finger extended, and hinting, in every way, that\r\nI was \"not i' the vein.\" I kept my lips closed. I dipped the pen in the\r\ninkstand several times, and held it hovering over the sheet. It would\r\nnot do. The old gentleman was not to be driven off his ground by shakes\r\nof the pen, ink-drops, or little fingers. He fumbled about in his\r\npockets, and drew forth the red-covered \"North American Thespian\r\nMagazine,\" devoted to the drama, &c., number twelve. He wanted \"a _good_\r\nnotice.\" The last was rather general. I had not specified its peculiar\r\nclaims upon the public. I had _copied_ nothing. That sort of critique\r\ndid no good. He begged me to _read_ this _carefully_--to _analyze_\r\nit--to give it a _candid_ examination. I was borne down by his emphatic\r\nmanner; and being naturally of a civil deportment, as well as, at that\r\nparticular moment, in an impatient, feverish hurry to get on with my\r\ntreatise on the \"Advantages of Virtue,\" which I felt now oozing out of\r\nmy subsiding brain with an alarming rapidity, I promised to read,\r\nnotice, investigate, analyze, to the uttermost extent of his wishes, or\r\nat least of my ability.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely keep myself screwed down to common courtesy till the\r\nmoment of his departure; a proceeding which he accomplished with a most\r\ncommendable self-possession and deliberate politeness. When he was\r\nfairly gone, I poked my head out, and called my boy.\r\n\r\n\"Peter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see that little old gentleman, Peter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should you know him again, Peter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he ever come here again, Peter, tell him I am not in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI reentered my little study, and closed the door after me with a slam,\r\nwhich could only have been perceptible to those who knew my ordinary\r\nstill and mild manner. There might have been also a slight accent in my\r\nway of turning the key, and (candor is a merit!) I could not repress a\r\nbrief exclamation of displeasure at the little old gentleman with his\r\nmagazine, who had broken in so provokingly upon my \"essay on virtue.\"\r\n\"Virtue or no virtue,\" thought I, \"I wish him to the d----.\"\r\n\r\nMy room is on the ground-floor, and a window adjoining the street lets\r\nin upon me the light and air through a heavy crimson curtain, near which\r\nI sit and scribble. I was just enlarging upon the necessity of\r\nresignation, while the frown yet lingered on my brow, and was writing\r\nmyself into a more calm and complacent mood, when--another knock at the\r\ndoor. As I opened it, I heard Peter's voice asserting sturdily that I\r\nhad \"gone out.\" Never dreaming of my old enemy, I betrayed too much of\r\nmy person to withdraw, and I was recognized and pounced upon by the\r\nlittle old gentleman who had come back to inform me that he intended, as\r\nsoon as the increase of his subscription would permit, to enlarge and\r\nimprove the \"North American Thespian Magazine,\" and to employ all the\r\nwriters in town. \"I intend also,\" said he, and he was in the act of\r\nagain laying aside that everlasting hat and cane, when a cry of fire in\r\nthe neighborhood, and the smell of the burning rafters attracted him\r\ninto the street, where, as I feared, he escaped unhurt. In many respects\r\nfires are calamities; but I never saw a more forcible exemplification of\r\nShakspeare's remark, \"There is some spirit of good in things evil,\" than\r\nin the relief afforded me on the present occasion. I wrote, after that,\r\nwith my door locked. This I knew was, from the confined air, prejudicial\r\nto my health; but what was dyspepsy or consumption to that little\r\nhard-faced old gentleman--to those breeches--to that broad-brimmed\r\nhat--to those buckles--to that gold-headed cane?\r\n\r\n\"Remember, Peter,\" said I, the second morning after the foregoing, \"I\r\nhave gone out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where have you gone?\" inquired Peter, with grave simplicity. \"They\r\nalways ask me where you have gone, sir. The little man with the hat was\r\nhere last night, and wanted to go after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forbid it Heaven! I have gone to Albany, Peter, on business.\"\r\n\r\nI can hear in my room pretty much what passes in the adjoining one,\r\nwhere visitors first enter from the street. I had scarcely got\r\ncomfortably seated, in a rare mood for poetry, giving the last touches\r\nto a poem, which, whatever might be the merits of Byron and Moore, I did\r\nnot think altogether indifferent, when I heard the little old\r\ngentleman's voice inquiring for me.\r\n\r\n\"I _must_ see him; I have important business,\" it said.\r\n\r\n\"He has gone out,\" replied Peter, in an undertone, in which I could\r\ndetect the consciousness that he was uttering a bouncer.\r\n\r\n\"But I _must_ see him,\" said the voice.\r\n\r\n\"The scoundrel!\" muttered I.\r\n\r\n\"He is not in town, sir,\" said Peter.\r\n\r\n\"I will not detain him a single minute. It is of the greatest\r\nimportance. He would be very sorry, _very_, should he miss me.\"\r\n\r\nI held my breath--there was a pause--I gave myself up for lost--when\r\nPeter replied firmly,\r\n\r\n\"He is in Albany, sir. Went off at five o'clock this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be back soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does he stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll call tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nI heard his retreating footsteps, and inwardly resolved to give Peter a\r\nhalf-dollar, although he deserved to be horsewhipped for his readiness\r\nat deception. I laughed aloud triumphantly, and slapped my hand down\r\nupon my knee with the feelings of a fugitive debtor, who, hotly pursued\r\nby a sheriff's officer, escapes over the line into another county, and\r\nsnaps his fingers at Monsieur Bailiff. I was aroused from my merry mood\r\nof reverie by a touch on my shoulder. I turned suddenly. It was the\r\nhard-faced little old gentleman, peeping in from the street. His\r\nbroad-brimmed hat and two-thirds of his face were just lifted above the\r\nwindow-sill. He was evidently standing on tiptoe; and the window being\r\nopen, he had put aside the curtain, and was soliciting my attention with\r\nthe end of his cane.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"is it you? Well, I _thought_ it was you, though I wasn't\r\nsure. I won't interrupt you. Here are the proofs of number thirteen;\r\nyou'll find something glorious in that--just the thing for you--don't\r\nforget me next week--good-bye. I'll see you again in a day or two.\"\r\n\r\nI shall not cast a gloom over my readers by dwelling upon my feelings.\r\nSurely, surely, there are sympathetic bosoms among them. To them I\r\nappeal. I said nothing. Few could have detected any thing violent or\r\nextraordinary in my manner, as I took the proofs from the end of the\r\nlittle old gentleman's cane, and laid them calmly on the table. I did\r\nnot write any more about \"virtue\" that morning. It was out of the\r\nquestion. Indeed, my mind scarcely recovered from the shock for several\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nWhen my nerves are in any way irritated, I find a walk in the woods a\r\nsoothing and agreeable sedative. Accordingly, the next afternoon, I\r\nwound up the affairs of the day earlier than usual, and set out for a\r\nramble through the groves and along the shore of Hoboken. I was soon on\r\none of the abrupt acclivities, where, through the deep rich foliage of\r\nthe intertwining branches, I overlooked the Hudson, the wide bay, and\r\nthe superb, steepled city, stretching in a level line of magnificence\r\nupon the shining waters, softened with an overhanging canopy of thin\r\nhaze. I gazed at the picture, and contemplated the rivalry of nature\r\nwith art, striving which could most delight. As my eye moved from ship\r\nto ship, from island to island, and from shore to shore--now reposing on\r\nthe distant blue, then revelling in the nearer luxuriance of the forest\r\ngreen, I heard a step in the grass, and a little ragged fellow came up\r\nand asked me if I was the editor of the ----. I was about replying to\r\nhim affirmatively, when his words arrested my attention. \"A little\r\ngentleman with a hat and cane,\" he said, \"had been inquiring for the\r\neditor, &c., at the adjoining hotel, and had given him sixpence to run\r\nup into the woods and find him.\" I rushed precipitately, as I thought,\r\ninto the thickest recesses of the wood. The path, however, being very\r\ncircuitous, I suddenly came into it, and nearly ran against a person\r\nwhom it needed no second glance to recognize, although his back was\r\nluckily toward me. The hat, the breeches, the cane, were enough. If not,\r\npart of a red-covered pamphlet, sticking out of the coat-pocket, was.\r\n\"It must be number thirteen!\" I exclaimed; and as the little old\r\ngentleman was sauntering north, I shaped my course with all possible\r\ncelerity in a southerly direction.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect myself for the future, I took precautionary\r\nmeasures; and in addition to having myself denied, I kept the window\r\ndown, and made my egress and ingress through a door round the corner, as\r\nPeter told me he had several times seen the little old gentleman, with a\r\npackage in his hand, standing opposite the one through which we usually\r\nentered, and looking at the office wistfully.\r\n\r\nBy means of these arrangements, I succeeded in preserving my solitude\r\ninviolate, when, to my indignation, I received several letters from\r\ndifferent parts of the country, written by my friends, and pressing upon\r\nme, at the solicitation of the little old gentleman, the propriety of\r\ngiving the \"Thespian Magazine\" a good notice. I tore the letters, each\r\none as I read them, into three pieces, and dropped them under the table.\r\nBusiness calling me, soon after, to Philadelphia, I stepped on board the\r\nsteamboat, exhilarated with the idea that I was to have at least two or\r\nthree weeks' respite. I reached the place of my destination about five\r\no'clock in the afternoon. It was lovely weather. The water spread out\r\nlike unrippled glass, and the sky was painted with a thousand varying\r\nshadows of crimson and gold. The boat touched the shore, and while I was\r\nwatching the change of a lovely cloud, I heard the splash of a heavy\r\nbody plunged into the water. A sudden sensation ran along the crowd,\r\nwhich rushed from all quarters towards the spot; the ladies shrieked and\r\nturned away their heads: and I perceived that a man had fallen from the\r\ndeck, and was struggling in the tide, with only one hand held\r\nconvulsively above the surface. Being a practised swimmer, I hesitated\r\nnot a moment, but flung off my hat and coat, and sprang to his rescue.\r\nWith some difficulty I succeeded in bearing him to a boat and dragging\r\nhim from the stream. I had no sooner done so, than to my horror and\r\nastonishment I found I had saved the little hard-faced old gentleman.\r\nHis snuff-colored breeches were dripping before me--his broad-brimmed\r\nhat floated on the current--but his cane (thank Heaven!) had sunk\r\nforever. He suffered no other ill consequences from the catastrophe than\r\nsome injury to his garments and the loss of his cane. His gratitude for\r\nmy exertions knew no bounds. He assured me of his conviction that the\r\nslight acquaintance previously existing between us would now be ripened\r\ninto intimacy, and informed me of his intention to lodge at the same\r\nhotel with me. He had come to Philadelphia to see about a plate for his\r\nsixteenth number, which was to surpass all its predecessors, and of\r\nwhich he would let me have an early copy, that I might _notice_ it as it\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" said Southey, writing to his friend Bedford, \"shall child of\r\nmine enter a school or a university. Perhaps I may not be able so well\r\nto instruct him in logic or languages, but I can at least preserve him\r\nfrom vice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Kings's College Magazine.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIES, LIVES, MEMOIRS, AND RECOLLECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nInnumerable biographies, innumerable traces of human life that is now\r\nlife no longer, may be met with in every walk. One lovely day, now some\r\ntime ago, we had been taking a walk in a part of England of which we had\r\nlittle knowledge, and we came up to the gate of what appeared to be a\r\nlarge hospital. It was covered with trees, and the beauty of summer was\r\nluxuriantly displayed. The grayheaded porter at the gate, a very\r\ncommunicative and happy old man, aged eighty-eight years, soon gave us a\r\nhistory of the institution. This hospital had been built by a man who\r\nwas much renowned. He had been once a poor shopboy, but he wandered to\r\nLondon, was very industrious, and at length became one of the greatest\r\nmerchants of the imperial city. He realized the visions of Whittington;\r\nfor he was twice Lord Mayor, was exceedingly wealthy, was honored with\r\nthe friendship of King William the Third, and was universally respected.\r\nAge coming on, he retired to his native place, built and endowed this\r\nhospital, became famous for his deeds of kindness and charity, always\r\nkept with reverence the day on which the Prince of Orange landed on\r\nEnglish ground, and, full of years and honors, sunk into his long\r\nrepose. The charitable institution was situated amid the most beautiful\r\nscenery. No place could be more fitting for the old men who sat basking\r\nin the sun to spend the quiet evening of their lives. This was the\r\nbiography of the great city merchant. It was not written in many\r\nvolumes; his good deeds were not ostentatiously displayed, and he now\r\nsleeps peacefully and well.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. On returning through a magnificent park, as the\r\nsun was setting, the haymakers returning from their labor, and all\r\nnature breathing peace, and happiness, and love, our attention was\r\nattracted to an old oak tree. It was indeed very old. It had seen all\r\nits brethren of the park rise and fall, seasons had come and gone,\r\ngenerations had reposed beneath its branches, and now they were reposing\r\nunder the shadow of the old church, the clock of which had just struck\r\nthe hour of six. On examining the tree closely, we were astonished to\r\nfind carved in immense letters, and in quaint language, the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n    \"This tree witnesse beare,\r\n    That two lovers did walke heare.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the feelings which the sights we had just seen\r\nhad excited, and enraptured as we were with the beautiful evening, this\r\nsimple inscription seemed more touching than the noblest verses. Knowing\r\nsomething of botany, it was not difficult to form some idea of the\r\nperiod when the inscription was written. It was not merely the external\r\nbark, but the deep woody layer also that had been cut by the carver's\r\nknife. It must have been cut while the tree was very young, for the bark\r\nhad very much expanded, and the letters were now more than a foot in\r\nlength. We stood contemplating the rude verse. In the distance the sun\r\nwas placidly reflecting the last golden rays, every thing was fresh and\r\ngreen, not a sound was heard. It must have been on such another lovely\r\neve that the two lovers had plighted their faith together, and\r\ncommemorated it on the young oak tree; and this was all we knew of them,\r\nall that we would ever know. This was their biography; this was their\r\nten volumes. Were they rich and noble, or poor and obscure? Did their\r\nlives pass in peace and content, or were their hearts pierced by the\r\npoisoned arrows of the world? Did they also feel how little real\r\nhappiness there was here, and did they also look forward to the time\r\nwhen they should rest from their labors in a place where there was no\r\nsuffering and no sorrow? Were they really happy in each other's love, or\r\nwere their young and pure affections chilled by the winds of adversity?\r\nIn vain we question the old oak tree. They are gone; the tree is silent;\r\nall that we know is that they walked here. And the world with its noise\r\nand folly is still going on, and publishing its biographies of ten\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Quarterly Review.\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be shot dead is one of the easiest modes of terminating life; yet,\r\nrapid as it is, the body has leisure to feel and time to reflect. On the\r\nfirst attempt by one of the frantic adherents of Spain to assassinate\r\nWilliam, Prince of Orange, who took the lead in the revolt of the\r\nNetherlands, the ball passed through the bones of his face, and brought\r\nhim to the ground. In the instant that preceded stupefaction, he was\r\nable to frame the notion that the ceiling of the room had fallen and\r\ncrushed him. The cannon shot which plunged into the brain of Charles\r\nXII. did not prevent him from seizing his sword by the hilt. The idea of\r\nan attack and the necessity for defence was impressed upon him by a blow\r\nwhich we should have supposed too tremendous to leave an interval for\r\nthought. But it by no means follows that the infliction of fatal\r\nviolence is accompanied by a pang. From what is known of the first\r\neffect of gunshot wounds, it is probable that the impression is rather\r\nstunning than acute. Unless death be immediate, the pain is as varied as\r\nthe nature of the injuries, and these are past counting up. But there is\r\nnothing singular in the dying sensations, though Lord Byron remarked the\r\nphysiological peculiarity, that the expression is invariably that of\r\nlanguor, while in death from a stab the countenance reflects the traits\r\nof natural character--of gentleness or ferocity--to the last breath.\r\nSome of these cases are of interest, to show with what slight\r\ndisturbance life may go on under mortal wound till it suddenly comes to\r\na final stop. A foot-soldier at Waterloo, pierced by a musket ball in\r\nthe hip, begged water from a trooper who chanced to possess a canteen\r\nof beer. The wounded man drank, returned his heartiest thanks, mentioned\r\nthat his regiment was nearly exterminated, and having proceeded a dozen\r\nyards in his way to the rear, fell to the earth, and with one convulsive\r\nmovement of his limbs concluded his career. \"Yet his voice,\" says the\r\ntrooper, who himself tells the story, \"gave scarcely the smallest sign\r\nof weakness.\" Captain Basil Hall, who in his early youth was present at\r\nthe Battle of Corunna, has singled out from the confusion which consigns\r\nto oblivion the woes and gallantry of war, another instance extremely\r\nsimilar, which occurred on that occasion. An old officer, who was shot\r\nin the head, arrived pale and faint at the temporary hospital, and\r\nbegged the surgeon to look at his wound, which was pronounced to be\r\nmortal. \"Indeed I feared so,\" he responded with impeded utterance, \"and\r\nyet I should like very much to live a little longer, if it were\r\npossible.\" He laid his sword upon a stone at his side, \"as gently,\" says\r\nHall, \"as if its steel had been turned to glass, and almost immediately\r\nsunk dead upon the turf.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Leader.\"\r\n\r\nBURLESQUES AND PARODIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the signs of intellectual barrenness and the vicious pandering to\r\nlower appetites, consequent upon the _trading_ spirit of literature, we\r\nnote with regret the growing tendency to desecrate beautiful subjects by\r\nusing them as materials for burlesque. We have had a _Comic History of\r\nEngland_--one of the dreariest and least excusable of jokes, and capable\r\nof for ever vulgarizing in the young mind the great deeds and noble life\r\nof our forefathers--and we have had burlesques in which the loved fairy\r\ntales that have charmed the imaginations of thousands, or subjects of\r\nmythology that belong to the religious history of the greatest people on\r\nrecord, are turned into coarse pot-house jests, with slang for wit, but\r\n_without_ the playful elegance by which Planche justifies his sport. It\r\nis a sign of intellectual barrenness in the writers; for what is easier\r\nthan parody? what means of raising a laugh so certain and so cheap as to\r\nroll a statue from its pedestal and stick some vulgar utensil in its\r\nplace? Laughter always follows the incongruous; and to make a Grecian\r\nDeity call for a pot of half-and-half, or to ask a Fairy Princess if her\r\nmother has parted with her mangle, is to secure the laugh, though\r\ncontempt may follow it. To our minds there is something melancholy in\r\nsuch spectacles. Degrading lofty images by ignoble associations must\r\noperate maleficiently on the spectator. And if it be absolutely\r\nnecessary to appeal to the coarse tastes and vulgar appetites of the\r\ncrowd, let it be done without at the same time dragging beautiful\r\nobjects through the mire.\r\n\r\nWe can understand the ribald buffoonery of LUCIAN, who first invented\r\nthis species of burlesque. His _object_ was to make the gods ridiculous.\r\nWhether the spirit which moved him was a mocking, skeptical spirit, like\r\nthat of Voltaire, or whether, as we think more probable, he was a bitter\r\nsatirist made bitter by the earnestness of his conviction, and\r\nridiculing the gods only as a _reductio ad absurdum_ of their\r\npretensions, the fact is indubitable, that he ridiculed them in a\r\npolemical spirit, and not to excite the vulgar laughter of the vulgar\r\ncrowd. But we, who do not believe in those gods, need no such warfare.\r\nTo us they are beautiful images associated only with high thoughts,\r\nuntil the burlesque writer, in his beggary of wit and invention, takes\r\nthem as the facile material out of which he can raise a laugh. Our\r\ncomplaint is twofold: first, that these subjects are soiled in our\r\nimaginations; secondly, that there is no compensating pleasure in the\r\nburlesque itself. The tendency is earthward, coarse, vulgarizing. It\r\nspoils a whole world of fancy, and it keeps down the creation of comic\r\nsubjects by supplying writers with an easy and certain success. Surely,\r\nthere is folly and humbug enough living and lying in the open day to\r\nsupply the satirist with material. Surely, these imitators of LUCIAN\r\n(unconscious imitators, no doubt, for many of them never read a line of\r\nhis dialogues) would be better employed in imitating the _spirit_ of his\r\nworks as well as the mere contrivance for producing the ludicrous, than\r\nin devastating Fairy Land for materials. It would be more difficult, no\r\ndoubt, but is _that_ a sufficient reason for abstaining?\r\n\r\nMusic may be parodied with success, and without evil consequences. That\r\nlies in the nature of music, which cannot be degraded. Let a hoarse,\r\nbeery voice, chant slang words to a melody of Mozart, and the next time\r\nyou hear the melody, it is as fresh and beautiful as if it had never\r\nbeen turned \"to such vile purpose;\" but it is not so with the beautiful\r\ncreations of impassioned fancy. Fancy is a Butterfly which must be\r\ndelicately handled; if rude fingers tamper with it, the flower-dust is\r\nrubbed off and the gay insect perishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS UPON RICHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the thirty-sixth year of his age, John Adams made the following entry\r\nin his Diary. He was then practising law in Boston, though living in\r\nBraintree.\r\n\r\n\"It has been my fate to be acquainted in the way of business with a\r\nnumber of very rich men--Gardiner, Bowdoin, Pitts, Hancock, Rowe, Lee,\r\nSargent, Hooper, Doane. Hooper, Gardiner, Rowe, Lee and Doane, have all\r\nacquired their wealth by their own industry; Bowdoin and Hancock\r\nreceived theirs by succession, descent, or devise; Pitts by marriage.\r\nBut there is not one of all these who derives more pleasure from his\r\nproperty than I do from mine; my little farm and stock and cash afford\r\nme as much satisfaction as all their immense tracts, extensive\r\nnavigation, sumptuous buildings, their vast sums at interest and stocks\r\nin trade yield to them. The pleasures of property arise from\r\nacquisition more than possession, from what is to come rather than what\r\nis. The rich are seldom remarkable for modesty, ingenuity or humanity.\r\nTheir wealth has rather a tendency to make them penurious and selfish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT DEATHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS XAVIER MICHAEL TOMIE, S.J., died on the tenth of December, 1850.\r\nWe find in the _Truth-Teller_ the following account of this excellent\r\nperson, with whom we had the pleasure of such acquaintance as assures us\r\nof its justice. He was born in 1792, in Tivoli, of the most respectable\r\nfamily in the place. He made his studies at home, under a private tutor;\r\npursued them in the Roman Seminary until the reestablishment of the\r\nSociety in 1814; that year he entered the novitiate, and immediately\r\nbegan to teach literature. He terminated with great distinction his\r\ncourse of theology, and as soon as the Roman College was restored to the\r\nSociety, in 1825, was appointed Professor. In the twelve following years\r\nhe was successively Rector of the Colleges of Spoleto, Fermo, Forli, and\r\nReggio di Modena. At Spoleto he was an intimate friend of Pius the\r\nNinth, then Cardinal Archbishop Mastai. While Rector of the College of\r\nFermo, he was chosen by Cardinal Ferretti, its founder, his theologian,\r\nand never did this Cardinal, even when in Rome, cease to place\r\nconfidence in his advice. In 1837 he was designated Professor of Moral\r\nTheology, and Prefect of Studies in the Roman College, where he lived\r\ntill the Revolution of 1848. Gregory XVI. had appointed him Examinator\r\nof the Roman Clergy, during which time he had prepared several\r\ndissertations, treatises, &c., on theology and philosophy, which may\r\nsome day be published. On the breaking out of the Revolution he retired\r\nsome time to Monseigneur Morini, of Florence, until this learned and\r\ndevout man was stabbed in the streets for his opposition to the\r\nrevolutionists. Thus cast upon the world without a protector, he wished\r\nto take refuge in the Sanctuary of the Virgin, at Genezzano, which\r\naccording to tradition was transported thither from Albania, and is\r\nstill kept by the Hermits of St. Augustine. His superior's wish however\r\nsent him to England, where he lived six months in the mansion of Lord\r\nWaterton. In 1849 he came to America, and taught moral theology in\r\nGeorgetown College. In 1850 he began to fill the same office (i.e.,\r\nProfessor of Moral Theology) in St. Joseph's Seminary, in the diocese of\r\nNew-York. He was endeared to the Church for his mildness, cheerfulness,\r\nand charity, insomuch that among the younger students of St. John's\r\nCollege he was known as the \"Good Father, who is always smiling.\" On the\r\n6th of December he fell ill; on the 8th, the President of St. John's\r\nCollege, in presence of the Fathers and Religious of the Society,\r\nadministered the viaticum. The following night he was anointed; and on\r\nthe 10th, towards ten o'clock in the afternoon, he breathed his last. On\r\nthe evening of the 11th, at six o'clock, according to the custom of the\r\nSociety, a solemn service was celebrated by all the members of St.\r\nJohn's College and Seminary. On the 12th, at six o'clock A. M., he was\r\nburied in the cemetery attached to the College.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PLUMER, formerly governor of New-Hampshire, died at his home in\r\nEpping, Rockingham county, in that State, on the 23d of December, at the\r\nadvanced age of ninety-three, and SAMUEL BELL, another ex-governor of\r\nNew-Hampshire, died at his home in the neighboring town of Chester, on\r\nthe same day. His age could not have been less than eighty. Both were\r\nmen of solid though not brilliant abilities; both were leaders of the\r\nDemocratic party in its struggles in support of Jefferson and Madison;\r\nboth ardent supporters of John Quincy Adams's election and\r\nadministration, and adverse to Jacksonism in all its phases; and each\r\nhas acted constantly and zealously with the Whig party through all its\r\nchanging fortunes. Mr. Plumer was first elected to the Chief Magistracy\r\nin 1812, and continued to be the Democratic candidate, with alternate\r\nsuccess and defeat, until 1819, when he declined, and Mr. Bell was\r\nnominated by the party, and chosen to succeed him. Mr. Bell was of a\r\ntall, graceful, commanding person. It was stated at the time of his\r\ninauguration that he seemed to be about a head taller than any other of\r\nthe thousands present at the ceremony. He was chosen a senator in\r\nCongress in 1823, and served through a full term; and would have been\r\nreelected in 1829, had not Isaac Hill meantime invented and given\r\ncurrency to a new style of Democracy, of which Bell had not been able to\r\ndiscern the excellence; so he retired to private life, in which he ever\r\nafterward continued. He cherished an especial affection for and\r\nconfidence in the great statesman of the west, Henry Clay, with whom it\r\nhad been his fortune to sympathize through his whole political life, and\r\nwhom he hoped yet to see elevated to the Presidency. His brother, John\r\nBell, who was governor some years after him, and beaten in 1829 by the\r\nfirst successful foray of Jacksonism, removed soon after to\r\nMassachusetts, where he died. Governor Plumer, it is understood, has\r\nleft important historical memoirs, which will probably be published.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BIRCH, the well-known painter, died in Philadelphia on the 14th\r\nof January, at the ripe age of seventy-two, after a life of quiet and\r\nlaborious devotion to his profession. He was distinguished in a\r\nparticular department of landscape and marine painting, delighting in\r\nthe treatment of coast and river scenes in their simpler and homelier\r\naspects, which he treated in his peculiar way, frequently with the best\r\neffect, and always with great fidelity to nature. He produced a very\r\nlarge number of pictures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN LAURITZ SVERDRUP, the celebrated Norwegian philologist, died\r\nat the University of Christiana, in which he had been a professor more\r\nthan forty-five years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

OGILVY, of Corrimony, who died at Edinburgh on the 14th of\r\nDecember, was a daughter of W. Fraser Tytler, Esq., and as \"Margaret\r\nFraser Tytler,\" was well known as the authoress of a very popular series\r\nof works for the young--\"Tales of the Great and Brave,\" \"Tales of Good\r\nand Great Kings,\" \"Lives of Celebrated Admirals,\" &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HOWISON, A.R.S.A., a well-known line engraver, died in\r\nEdinburgh, on the 20th December. He was born at Edinburgh, in 1798. He\r\nwas educated in George Heriot's Hospital; and on leaving that\r\ninstitution was apprenticed to an engraver, of the name of Wilson. Even\r\nas a boy he was remarkable for industry, perseverance, and punctuality.\r\nHe never received any instructions in drawing, beyond what he acquired\r\nfor himself during the period of his apprenticeship. He was, in every\r\nway, truly a self-made man. Mr. Harvey was the first to appreciate Mr.\r\nHowison's talents, and to afford scope for their display, by employing\r\nhim to engrave the well-known picture of \"The Curlers;\" and it is no\r\ndetraction from the merits of that painting to say, that the admirable\r\nskill displayed in transferring it to copper contributed in no small\r\ndegree to the reputation of the painter. On the completion of \"The\r\nCurlers,\" Mr. Howison was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish\r\nAcademy--the only instance, we believe, of such an honor being conferred\r\nupon an engraver. Mr. Howison afterwards engraved the \"Polish Exiles,\"\r\nby Sir William Allan; the \"Covenanters' Communion,\" and the \"Schule\r\nSkailing,\" by Harvey; and at the period of his death he was engaged upon\r\nthe \"First Letter from the Emigrants,\" after Thomas Faed, for the\r\nAssociation for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Scotland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHYPPOLITE ROYER-COLLARD, nephew of the eminent philosopher of that name,\r\ndied at Paris on the 15th of December, at the age of 48, after having\r\nbeen for five years afflicted by a paralysis, which did not however\r\naffect his mental powers. He was Professor of Public Hygiene, at the\r\nSchool of Medicine, and drew crowded audiences to his lectures. To a\r\nmind of rare scientific acuteness and endowments, he added an active and\r\nfertile imagination, and great youthfulness of spirit. He inherited the\r\nintellectual tendencies of his uncle, and was an intimate friend of\r\nGuizot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOL. WILLIAMS, formerly M.P. for Ashton, died at Wootton, near\r\nLiverpool, on the 19th December, aged eighty-seven. At twelve years of\r\nage, he joined General Burgoyne's army in America, and carried the flag\r\nof truce upon the memorable occasion of the surrender at Saratoga. It is\r\nsupposed that he was the last survivor of that army. After twenty-five\r\nyears of active service in Nova Scotia, St. Domingo, and Jamaica, in\r\nHolland and in Ireland, he quitted the army in 1800, at which period the\r\ncareer of most of the military men of the present day commenced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. WILLIAM STURGEON, well known for scientific attainments, died on the\r\n15th December, at Manchester, where he had for some years filled the\r\noffice of lecturer on science to the Royal Victoria Gallery of Practical\r\nScience. He was born at Whittington, in Lancashire, in 1783, and was\r\napprenticed by his parents to a shoemaker. In 1802, he entered the\r\nWestmoreland militia, and two years later he enlisted as a private\r\nsoldier in the Royal Artillery. While in this corps he devoted his\r\nleisure to scientific studies, and appears to have made himself familiar\r\nwith all the great facts of electricity and magnetism which were then\r\nopening to the world. His subsequent career created for him a name in\r\nthe annals of scientific discovery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOSEPH B. ANTHONY, President Judge of the Eighth Judicial District of\r\nPennsylvania, died at his residence in Williamsport on the 11th January.\r\nHe was born in Philadelphia, on the 19th day of June, 1795. While young,\r\nhe for a time taught school in Milton, Northumberland county, at which\r\nplace he studied law. He went to Ohio, and after an absence of about one\r\nyear returned to Pennsylvania. In 1818 he was admitted to the bar at\r\nWilliamsport, where he continued to reside until his death. In 1830 he\r\nwas elected by the Democratic party to the Senate of Pennsylvania. In\r\nthe year 1831 he was elected to Congress, and two years after was\r\nreelected by an unprecedented majority. During the early part of the\r\nadministration of Governor Porter he was appointed Judge of the\r\nNicholson Court of Pennsylvania, and in March, 1844, was appointed\r\nPresident Judge of the Eighth Judicial District.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. OSBALDISTON, the well-known tragedian and theatrical manager, died\r\nat his residence, near London, on the 29th December. He was fifty-six or\r\nfifty-seven years of age, and besides sustaining tragic characters at\r\nmost of the London and provincial theatres, he has held the reins of\r\nmanagement at the Surrey, Sadler's Wells, Covent-Garden, and City of\r\nLondon theatres.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHEOLOGICAL SCIENCE, says the _Methodist Quarterly Review_, has\r\nsustained another blow in the loss of Professor MAU, of Kiel, who died\r\nsome weeks ago. His studies lay mostly in the line of New-Testament\r\nTheology; and he is known especially by his treatise _Of Death, the\r\nWages of Sin, and of Salvation_ (Vom Tode, des Suenden Solde, u. von d.\r\nErloesung). The work, which is distinguished for its acute and vigorous\r\nthought, was written in reply to one on the same subject by Professor\r\nKrabbe, of Rostock. Its chief peculiarity is the doctrine that the death\r\nof the body is inherent in its constitution, not the effect of sin; and\r\ntherefore that redemption has regard only to spiritual death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMRS.

He\r\nentered the British Army in 1792, and served in the West Indies,\r\nreceiving a medal and clasp for his services at Martinique, and\r\nGuadaloupe, in 1809 and 1810. In 1813, he served in the American war,\r\nand was severely wounded at the battle of Chippewa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLIEUT.

He was of\r\nGerman birth, but spoke the English and the French language with\r\nfluency. A Democrat and Socialist by constitution, he devoted all the\r\nresources of an ardent nature and ready talents to the triumph of his\r\nprinciples. It is now some eight years since he first removed to this\r\ncountry, and established in New-York a weekly paper called the\r\n_Volks-Tribun_, in which he advocated the most radical ideas upon the\r\nrelations of capital and labor, with as much ability as earnestness. In\r\nhis views of American politics he inclined to the so-called democratic\r\nparty, and when the Mexican War commenced gave it a hearty support--not\r\nbecause he had carefully inquired into its justice, but because he\r\nregarded the absorption of Mexico, and indeed the entire continent, by\r\nthe United States, and the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race in the\r\nwestern world, as absolutely essential to the progress of humanity.\r\nThough not originally a land reformer, he adopted and vigorously\r\ndefended not only the doctrine that the earth belongs to the human race\r\nand cannot rightfully be trafficked in any more than can the air or the\r\nsunlight, but the measures which American reformers have deduced\r\ntherefrom, namely, land limitation, freedom of the public domain,\r\nhomestead exemption, &c. During this time he wrote and published in\r\nGerman a history of the United States, as well as a series of\r\ntranslations from the writings of our revolutionary patriots, works of\r\nthe highest value to our German citizens. The _Volks-Tribun_ ceased to\r\nbe published in 1847, and for some time after Mr. Kriege gained a\r\nlivelihood by teaching German. He also gave here, in his native tongue,\r\na course of lectures on German Literature, which were greatly enjoyed by\r\nthose who attended them. On the breaking out of the Revolution of 1848,\r\nhe returned to Germany, and took an active share in the democratic\r\nmovements. He was one of the Supreme Executive Committee, consisting of\r\nthree members, if we remember rightly, which had its seat at Berlin, and\r\nthence conducted a revolutionary propaganda throughout the country. In\r\nthe spring of 1849 he returned to the United States again, and took\r\neditorial charge of the _Illinois Staats Zeitung_ at Chicago. But the\r\nreaction which now followed the intense excitement of the previous year\r\nin Europe, proved too much for his physical powers, which were far from\r\nrobust. His health compelled him to resign his connection with that\r\npaper and come back to the city. He fell into a sort of apathy which\r\nresulted in a partial derangement of his mind, and finally in the\r\ncomplete prostration of his system. After lingering for some months he\r\nat last expired with tranquillity, in the thirtieth year of his age. He\r\nwas a man of extensive acquirements. His knowledge of history was very\r\ncomprehensive and accurate. His intellect, though not remarkably\r\noriginal or brilliant, was clear and vigorous. His heart was of the\r\nmanly and noble kind. There is encouragement in the recollection of such\r\na man.--_Tribune._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMME.

His work on \"The Equitable\r\nJurisdiction of the Court of Chancery,\" is founded partly on Maddock's\r\n\"Treatise on the Principles and Practice of the High Court of Chancery;\"\r\nyet it is, in many important particulars, essentially an original work.\r\nThis able production, the second volume of which appeared in 1849, has\r\nbeen generally commended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERAL SIR WM.

He entered the army at the age of\r\neighteen, in 1787, and continued in service through the greater part of\r\nhis life. In the Irish Rebellion, in 1798, he commanded the 22nd Light\r\nDragoons, and was wounded at Antrim. He was afterwards in Egypt, at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, and in South America, at the capture of Monte Video\r\nin 1807. After commanding the advanced force at the taking of Ischia,\r\nand after attaining the rank of Major-General, Lumley joined the British\r\narmy in the Peninsula. He there won great distinction at the first siege\r\nof Badajoz, and he led the whole allied cavalry at the battle of\r\nAlbuera; few, indeed, were more useful during the Peninsular war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROBERT ROSCOE, third son of the historian, died during the early part of\r\nDecember, in his sixty-first year. For some time he followed the\r\nprofession of the law, in partnership with the late Mr. Edgar Taylor;\r\nbut he retired from active life, in consequence of infirm health, many\r\nyears ago. Like all the members of the Roscoe family, he had literary\r\npowers, which an unusual amount of self-distrust prevented his\r\nexercising largely. The completion of Mr. Fitchett's huge epic of\r\n\"Alfred\" was done by him in fulfilment of a promise, and he wrote other\r\npoems, and some small works in prose, not unworthy of a son of William\r\nRoscoe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. RICHIE, a sculptor of some reputation, from Edinburgh, went lately\r\nto Rome, where he died during the month of September. His death is\r\nmainly attributable to an excursion he made with some friends to Ostio,\r\nwhere, ignorant of the effects of the climate, and of the precautions\r\nnecessary to be taken in it, he caught the malaria fever, and expired\r\nafter his return to Rome. He was followed to the English cemetery by\r\nmost of the English and American artists resident there. His journey to\r\nRome had been for some years the object of his most ardent hopes and\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. MARTIN D'AUCH, the only surviving member of the first Constituent\r\nAssembly of the First French Republic, and the only one who, at the oath\r\nof the Jeu de Paume, refused to sign the declaration of the Tiers-Parti,\r\nhas just died at Castlenaudary. In David's well-known picture, M. d'Auch\r\nis represented with his arms folded on his breast, and refusing to join\r\nhis colleagues.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe well-known Dutch painter, MORITZ, died lately at the Hague, aged\r\nseventy-seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Miscellany.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Report by five eminent members has been made to the Paris Academy of\r\nSciences, on a paper from Colonel Lesbros, entitled _Hydraulic\r\nExperiments relative to the Laws of the Flowing of Water_. Two thousand\r\nexperiments, carried through four years, are detailed in three hundred\r\nand twelve pages of text, with thirty-seven large plates. The work was\r\nrecommended to the Academy by the Minister of War. The Committee say, at\r\nthe end of their report:--\"Considering the high utility of these\r\nexperimental researches, prosecuted to the end in the most satisfactory\r\nand complete manner; and being convinced of the beneficial effect which\r\nthe publication of them may have in the promotion of science, and its\r\napplication to public works,--to navigation, agriculture, hydraulic\r\nestablishments, and the various branches of industry connected with\r\nthem,--the Committee are of opinion that the Academy should accord full\r\napprobation to the work, and direct the early insertion of it in the\r\nTransactions.\" All parts of the report show that the publication will be\r\nof importance to both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the December number of the _Comte Rendu_ of the Paris Academy of\r\nMoral and Political Sciences, nearly twenty pages are occupied by one of\r\nthe Reports of Blanqui, the Political Economist, on the Rural\r\nPopulations of France. He made his personal survey, this year, as\r\nCommissioner of the Academy. He is preparing a work, in several volumes,\r\non the state, in every particular, of the inhabitants of France, in\r\nevery part. His abstract of his recent survey of the Departments of the\r\ncentre, including the basin of the Loire, abounds with curious details,\r\nespecially as to the diversity of the manner in which the Revolution of\r\nFebruary, 1848, affected the rural and city populations in their minds\r\nand interests. He speaks of the city of _Saint Etienne_ as\r\n_extemporized_ after the American fashion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICAN EXPLORING EXPEDITION.--Intelligence has been received from\r\nthe Saharan African Expedition up to the 29th of August last. The\r\nexpedition had literally fought its way up to Selonfeet in Aheer, near\r\nto the territory of the Kaillouee Prince, En-Nour, to whom it is\r\nrecommended. Mr. Richardson had been obliged to ransom his life and\r\nthose of his fellow-travellers twice. The whole population of the\r\nnorthern districts of Aheer had been raised against the expedition,\r\njoined by all the bandits and robbers who infest that region of the\r\nSahara. The travellers are now in comparative security. The great Soudan\r\nroute, from Ghat to Aheer, is explored. Of the expedition of Von Muller\r\nwe have a few days later but not important news.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society of London, at the last annual meeting, awarded \"the\r\nRoyal Medal\" to Mr. Benjamin Brodie, F.R.S. (eldest son of Sir B.\r\nBrodie, Bart.) for his papers on the chemical nature of wax. It is\r\nnearly forty years since the Royal Society awarded the \"Copley medal\" to\r\nSir Benjamin Brodie for his paper \"on poisons;\" the only instance of\r\nfather and son receiving the same distinction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf an Hungarian Academy, Mr. Walsh writes to the _Journal of Commerce_,\r\n\"Last month Mr. Kenigswater transmitted to the Academy of Moral and\r\nPolitical Sciences, a very interesting communication relative to the\r\nNational Academy of Hungary, with the existence of which few of the\r\nFrench savants were acquainted. The idea of establishing a National\r\nSociety for universal knowledge, dates from the end of the last century.\r\nIts accomplishment was delayed by political causes, and the want of\r\nadequate funds. But a Magyar Count succeeded, in 1827, in obtaining an\r\nact of the Diet for the creation of such an institute. He presented it\r\nwith a sum of thirty thousand dollars; another magnate gave twenty\r\nthousand dollars; many others ten thousand; so that the fund from\r\nvoluntary contributions, amounts to nearly two hundred thousand\r\ndollars--a million of francs. The Academy was inaugurated in 1830, and\r\ndivided into six sections--Philology, Philosophy, History,\r\nJurisprudence, Mathematics, and the Natural Sciences. Its only President\r\nsince that period has been Count Joseph Teleki, deemed an excellent\r\nhistorian, to whom and his brothers it is indebted for a sum of\r\ntwenty-five thousand francs, and a library of fifty thousand volumes. It\r\nconsists now of nineteen honorary members; thirty-eight active or\r\nresident; and of a hundred and twenty-five corresponding members for the\r\nseveral sections. Each section has a weekly meeting; there are monthly\r\nand annual sittings of all. Papers on erudite and scientific subjects\r\nare read; the Magyar language is alone permitted in its business and\r\ntransactions, except as to the communications of its foreign\r\ncorrespondents. It has published, at its own expense, a very large\r\nnumber of works; among them a series of critical Commentaries on the\r\nancient monuments of the Magyar language, \"which bears no affinity to\r\nthe European tongues, and differs as much from the Sclavonic as from the\r\nTeutonic and the Latin idioms.\" There is a very important and very rich\r\ncollection of Hungarian translations of the Latin and Greek classics;\r\nanother of translations of the principal modern dramatic authors. The\r\nHungarian mind has been prolific for its stage, in original pieces. The\r\nAcademy awards prizes, confers distinctions, &c., &c.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn important discovery has been made by M. NICHOLAS ZACH, a lithographer\r\nof Munich. He has invented a process by which, by means of a preparation\r\napplied to designs traced by a pointed instrument on a plate of any sort\r\nof metal, the drawing reproduces itself in relief, in less than an hour,\r\non the plate. M. Zach has given to his discovery the title of\r\n_Metallography_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGAS FROM WATER.--Mr. Paine's alleged discovery of a new process of\r\nprocuring gas _from water_, after some months of discredit and ridicule,\r\nis acquiring fresh interest and importance. Mr. Elizur Wright, editor of\r\nthe Boston _Chronotype_, and other gentlemen of ability and\r\nintelligence, have visited Worcester, and examined the whole process and\r\nthe apparatus employed in it, and are perfectly convinced of the reality\r\nand importance of the discovery. A similar discovery is said to have\r\nbeen made recently in Paris. Mr. Paine has received from England letters\r\npatent for his discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLadies Fashions for February.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Ladies' Equestrian Costume._--Riding-habit of green cloth or\r\ncashmere; the skirt very long and full, and the corsage fastened from\r\nthe waist to the throat by a row of fancy silk buttons of the color of\r\nthe habit. A pardessus or polka jacket of cinnamon-colored cloth or\r\nmerino. It has rather a deep basquine, and the corsage, which has a\r\nturning over collar and lappels, is open in front of the bosom. It is\r\nedged with a narrow band of black velvet. The sleeves are long, close to\r\nthe arms, and slit open at the lower part, showing under sleeves of\r\nwhite cambric of moderate fulness, gathered on bands at the wrists. The\r\npardessus is confined in front (not quite so low as the waist) by a gilt\r\nagrafe. Round the throat a small collar of worked muslin or a necktie of\r\nplaided ribbon. Round riding-hat of black beaver, with a small\r\ncock's-tail plume on one side. Veil of a very thin green or black tulle.\r\nUnder the habit a jupon of cambric muslin with a deep border of\r\nneedlework. Pale yellow riding gloves, and black boots.\r\n\r\nII. _Boy's Dress._--Jacket of bright blue cloth, trimmed on the two\r\nfronts with broad silk braid of the same color, placed in rows of three\r\nand three together. The sleeves are close at the ends, and the\r\nwristbands of the shirt are turned up just sufficiently to cover the\r\nedges of the jacket sleeves. Waistcoat of white pique. Trousers of white\r\nand blue stripe. A plain square shirt collar, turned down, and a red\r\nsilk necktie. Cap of black velvet. Glazed leather boots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIII. _An Evening Costume_, of pale lavender silk; the waist and point of\r\na moderate length; the corsage is low, and _a la Grecque_; the short\r\nsleeves are open the front of the arm, and trimmed with a looped silk\r\nfringe; the skirt is long and full, and has five pieces, _en bias_, set\r\non plain, and edged with fringe corresponding to that on the sleeves.\r\n\r\nIV. _An elegant Visiting Dress_ of pale stone-colored _taffetas_, the\r\nskirt handsomely trimmed with three distinct rows of flounces, each row\r\nconsisting of four rows of narrow flounces, pinked and waved at the\r\nedge, the upper row reaching to a little below the waist; plain high\r\ncorsage, made open in the front, and trimmed with four narrow frills,\r\nput on nearly plain upon the front, where they meet in a point at the\r\nwaist, and forming a kind of cape over the back and shoulders; half-long\r\nsleeves, trimmed to match; under-sleeves and chemisette of fine lawn.\r\nBonnet of pink _velours epingle_, the exterior decorated with a cluster\r\nof pink flowers on the right, a pink blond encircling the edge, being\r\nturned back plain over the front, the interior fulled with pink _tulle_,\r\nand half wreaths of green heath.\r\n\r\n_The skirts of ball dresses_ still continue to be very highly trimmed.\r\nFlounces are the favorite style of trimming, and not unfrequently as\r\nmany as ten are put on. Sometimes rows of lace are disposed alternately\r\nwith flounces of the same material as the dress. For this purpose either\r\nblack or white lace may be employed; the choice being determined by the\r\ntint of the dress. A novel style of trimming for the skirts of evening\r\ndresses consists of rows of broad fringe instead of flounces.\r\n\r\nAnother description of _trimming_ resembling fringe, but made of\r\nmarabout feathers, is employed for ball dresses. Tulle dresses of two or\r\nthree jupes have the lowest one edged simply with a hem, and the upper\r\nones edged with a row of marabout fringe. The sleeves and berthe should\r\nbe edged with corresponding trimming.\r\n\r\n_Manteau Andriana_, of violet velvet, having a small _capuchon_, or\r\nhood, decorated with a rich fancy trimming in _passementerie_, to which\r\nare attached at regular distances long soft tassels; very wide sleeves,\r\nin the Oriental form, decorated to match the _capuchon_; the lower part\r\nof the cloak is ornamented with a kind of shell-work in _passementerie_,\r\nwhich forms _galerie_; upon the fronts are placed _brandebourgs_ in\r\nSpanish points.\r\n\r\n_Caps_ intended for morning toilette are very novel in their form and\r\nappearance, the most favorite style being a little _coiffe Bretonne_,\r\nhaving _papillons_ of lace turned back, and _chutes_ of lilac and violet\r\nvelvet; then, again, those the crown of which is formed of _torsades_ of\r\nribbon, over which fall two rows of English lace, and having two\r\nhalf-wreaths of _vapeur_ ribbon encircling the back part.",
