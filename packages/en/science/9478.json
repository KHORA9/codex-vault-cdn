Such points, however, as he thought might be\r\nimproved, and such matter as appeared necessary to adapt the volume more\r\nespecially to the wants of this country, he has introduced in the course\r\nof its pages. These additions, amounting to about sixty pages, will be\r\nfound between brackets, with the initial of the Editor appended. He\r\ntrusts they will not detract from the interest of the volume, while he\r\nhopes that its usefulness may be thereby somewhat increased.\r\n\r\nWith this explanation of his connexion with the work, he leaves it in\r\nthe hope that it may prove of value to the sportsman from its immediate\r\nrelation to his stirring pursuits; to the general reader, from the large\r\namount of curious information collected in its pages, which is almost\r\ninaccessible in any other form; and to the medical student, from the\r\nlight it sheds on the pathology and diseases of the dog, by which he\r\nwill be surprised to learn how many ills that animal shares in common\r\nwith the human race.\r\n\r\nThe editor will be satisfied with his agency in the publication of this\r\nvolume, if it should be productive of a more extended love for this\r\nbrave, devoted, and sagacious animal, and be the means of improving his\r\nlot of faithful servitude. It is with these views that the editor has\r\noccasionally turned from more immediate engagements to investigate his\r\ncharacter, and seek the means of ameliorating his condition.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, October, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter\r\n\r\nI.

We exact the services of other animals, and, the task\r\nbeing performed, we dismiss them to their accustomed food and rest; but\r\nseveral of the varieties of the dog follow us to our home; they are\r\nconnected with many of our pleasures and wants, and guard our sleeping\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe first animal of the domestication of which we have any account, was\r\nthe sheep. \"Abel was a keeper of sheep.\" [1] It is difficult to believe\r\nthat any long time would pass before the dog--who now, in every country\r\nof the world, is the companion of the shepherd, and the director or\r\nguardian of the sheep--would be enlisted in the service of man.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest known history he was the protector of the habitation\r\nof the human being. At the feet of the 'lares', those household deities\r\nwho were supposed to protect the abodes of men, the figure of a barking\r\ndog was often placed. In every age, and almost in every part of the\r\nglobe, he has played a principal part in the labours, the dangers, and\r\nthe pleasures of the chase.\r\n\r\nIn process of time, man began to surround himself with many servants\r\nfrom among the lower animals, but among them all he had only one\r\nfriend--the dog; one animal only whose service was voluntary, and who\r\nwas susceptible of disinterested affection and gratitude. In every\r\ncountry, and in every time, there has existed between man and the dog a\r\nconnection different from that which is observed between him and any\r\nother animal. The ox and the sheep submit to our control, but their\r\naffections are principally, if not solely, confined to themselves. They\r\nsubmit to us, but they can rarely be said to love, or even to recognise\r\nus, except as connected with the supply of their wants.\r\n\r\nThe horse will share some of our pleasures. He enjoys the chase as much\r\nas does his rider; and, when contending for victory on the course, he\r\nfeels the full influence of emulation. Remembering the pleasure he has\r\nexperienced with his master, or the daily supply of food from the hand\r\nof the groom, he often exhibits evident tokens of recognition; but that\r\nis founded on a selfish principle--he neighs that he may be fed, and his\r\naffections are easily transferred.\r\n\r\nThe dog is the only animal that is capable of disinterested affection.\r\nHe is the only one that regards the human being as his companion, and\r\nfollows him as his friend; the only one that seems to possess a natural\r\ndesire to be useful to him, or from a spontaneous impulse attaches\r\nhimself to man. We take the bridle from the mouth of the horse, and turn\r\nhim free into the pasture, and he testifies his joy in his partially\r\nrecovered liberty. We exact from the dog the service that is required of\r\nhim, and he still follows us. He solicits to be continued as our\r\ncompanion and our friend. Many an expressive action tells us how much he\r\nis pleased and thankful. He shares in our abundance, and he is content\r\nwith the scantiest and most humble fare. He loves us while living, and\r\nhas been known to pine away on the grave of his master.\r\n\r\n[It is stated that the favourite lap-dog of Mary, Queen of Scots, that\r\naccompanied her to the scaffold, continued to caress the body after the\r\nhead was cut off, and refused to relinquish his post till forcibly\r\nwithdrawn, and afterwards died with grief in the course of a day or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThe following account is also an authentic instance of the inconsolable\r\ngrief displayed by a small cur-dog at the death of his master:--A poor\r\ntailor in the parish of St. Olave, having died, was attended to the\r\ngrave by his dog, who had expressed every token of sorrow from the\r\ninstant of his master's death, and seemed unwilling to quit the corpse\r\neven for a moment. After the funeral had dispersed, the faithful animal\r\ntook his station upon the grave, and was with great difficulty driven by\r\nthe sexton from the church ground; on the following day he was again\r\nobserved lying on the grave of his master, and was a second time\r\nexpelled from the premises. Notwithstanding the harsh treatment received\r\non several succeeding days by the hands of the sexton, this little\r\ncreature would persist in occupying this position, and overcame every\r\ndifficulty to gain access to the spot where all he held most dear was\r\ndeposited. The minister of the parish, learning the circumstances of the\r\ncase, ordered the dog to be carried to his house, where he was confined\r\nand fed for several days, in hopes of weaning him by kind treatment to\r\nforget his sorrow occasioned by the loss of his master. But all his\r\nbenevolent efforts were of no utility, as the dog availed himself of the\r\nfirst opportunity to escape, and immediately repaired to his chosen spot\r\nover the grave.\r\n\r\nThis worthy clergyman now allowed him to follow the bent of his own\r\ninclinations; and, as a recompense for true friendship and unfeigned\r\nsorrow, had a house built for him over this hallowed spot, and daily\r\nsupplied him with food and water for the space of two years, during\r\nwhich time he never wandered from his post, but, as a faithful guardian,\r\nkept his lonely watch day and night, till death at last put an end to\r\nhis sufferings, and laid him by the side of his long-expected\r\nmaster.--L.]\r\n\r\nAs an animal of draught the dog is highly useful in some countries. What\r\nwould become of the inhabitants of the northern regions, if the dog were\r\nnot harnessed to the sledge, and the Laplander, and the Greenlander, and\r\nthe Kamtschatkan drawn, and not unfrequently at the rate of nearly a\r\nhundred miles a day, over the snowy wastes? In Newfoundland, the timber,\r\none of the most important articles of commerce, is drawn to the\r\nwater-side by the docile but ill-used dog; and we need only to cross the\r\nBritish Channel in order to see how useful, and, generally speaking, how\r\nhappy a beast of draught the dog can be.\r\n\r\n[Large mongrel dogs are very extensively used on the Continent in\r\npulling small vehicles adapted to various purposes. In fact, most of the\r\ncarts and wagons that enter Paris, or are employed in the city, have one\r\nof these animals attached to them by a short strap hanging from the\r\naxle-tree. This arrangement answers the double purpose of keeping off\r\nall intruders in the temporary absence of the master, and, by pushing\r\nhimself forward in his collar, materially assists the horse in\r\npropelling a heavy load up-hill, or of carrying one speedily over a\r\nplain surface. It is quite astonishing to see how well broken to this\r\nwork these dogs are, and at the same time to witness with what vigour\r\nand perseverance they labour in pushing before them, in that way,\r\nenormous weights.--L.]\r\n\r\nThough, in our country, and to its great disgrace, this employment of\r\nthe dog has been accompanied by such wanton and shameful cruelty, that\r\nthe Legislature--somewhat hastily confounding the abuse of a thing with\r\nits legitimate purpose--forbade the appearance of the dog-cart in the\r\nmetropolitan districts, and were inclined to extend this prohibition\r\nthrough the whole kingdom, it is much to be desired that a kindlier and\r\nbetter feeling may gradually prevail, and that this animal, humanely\r\ntreated, may return to the discharge of the services of which nature has\r\nrendered him capable, and which prove the greatest source of happiness\r\nto him while discharging them to the best of his power.\r\n\r\nIn another and very important particular,--as the preserver of human\r\nlife,--the history of the dog will be most interesting. The writer of\r\nthis work has seen a Newfoundland dog who, on five distinct occasions,\r\npreserved the life of a human being; and it is said of the noble\r\nquadruped whose remains constitute one of the most interesting specimens\r\nin the museum of Berne, that forty persons were rescued by him from\r\nimpending destruction.\r\n\r\nWhen this friend and servant of man dies, he does not or may not cease\r\nto be useful; for in many countries, and to a far greater extent than is\r\ngenerally imagined, his skin is useful for gloves, or leggings, or mats,\r\nor hammercloths; and, while even the Romans occasionally fattened him\r\nfor the table, and esteemed his flesh a dainty, many thousands of people\r\nin Asia, Africa, and America, now breed him expressly for food.\r\n\r\nIf the publication of the present work should throw some additional\r\nlight on the good qualities of this noble animal; if it should enable us\r\nto derive more advantage from the services that he can render--to train\r\nhim more expeditiously and fully for the discharge of those services--to\r\nprotect him from the abuses to which he is exposed, and to mitigate or\r\nremove some of the diseases which his connection with man has entailed\r\nupon him; if any of these purposes be accomplished, we shall derive\r\nconsiderable \"useful knowledge\" as well as pleasure from the perusal of\r\nthe present volume.\r\n\r\nSome controversy has arisen with regard to the origin of the dog.\r\nProfessor Thomas Bell, to whom we are indebted for a truly valuable\r\nhistory of the British quadrupeds, traces him to the wolf. He says, and\r\nit is perfectly true, that the osteology of the wolf does not differ\r\nmaterially from that of the dog more than that of the different kinds of\r\ndogs differs; that the cranium is similar, and they agree in nearly all\r\nthe other essential points; that the dog and wolf will readily breed\r\nwith each other, and that their progeny, thus obtained, will again\r\nmingle with the dog. [The relative length of the intestines is a strong\r\ndistinctive mark both as to the habits and species of animals; those of\r\na purely carnivorous nature are much shorter than others who resort\r\nentirely to an herbaceous diet, or combine the two modes of sustenance\r\naccording to circumstances. The dog and wolf have the intestines of the\r\nsame length. (See Sir Everard Home on Comparative Anatomy.)--L.] There\r\nis one circumstance, however, which seems to mark a decided difference\r\nbetween the two animals; the eye of the dog of every country and species\r\nhas a circular pupil, but the position or form of the pupil is oblique\r\nin the wolf. Professor Bell gives an ingenious but not admissible reason\r\nfor this. He attributes the forward direction of the eyes in the dog to\r\nthe constant habit, \"for many successive generations, of looking towards\r\ntheir master, and obeying his voice:\" but no habit of this kind could by\r\npossibility produce any such effect. It should also be remembered that,\r\nin every part of the globe in which the wolf is found this form of the\r\npupil, and a peculiar setting on of the curve of the tail, and a\r\nsingularity in the voice, cannot fail of being observed; to which may be\r\nadded, that the dog exists in every latitude and in every climate, while\r\nthe habitation of the wolf is confined to certain parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nThere is also a marked difference in the temper and habits of the two.\r\nThe dog is, generally speaking, easily manageable, but nothing will, in\r\nthe majority of cases, render the wolf moderately tractable. There are,\r\nhowever, exceptions to this. The author remembers a bitch wolf at the\r\nZoological Gardens that would always come to the front bars of her den\r\nto be caressed as soon as any one that she knew approached. She had\r\npuppies while there, and she brought her little ones in her mouth to be\r\nnoticed by the spectators; so eager, indeed, was she that they should\r\nshare with her in the notice of her friends, that she killed them all in\r\nsuccession against the bars of her den as she brought them forcibly\r\nforward to be fondled.\r\n\r\nM.F. Cuvier gives an account of a young wolf who followed his master\r\neverywhere, and showed a degree of affection and submission scarcely\r\ninferior to the domesticated dog. His master being unavoidably absent,\r\nhe was sent to the menagerie, where he pined for his loss, and would\r\nscarcely take any food for a considerable time. At length, however, he\r\nattached himself to his keepers, and appeared to have forgotten his\r\nformer associate. At the expiration of eighteen months his master\r\nreturned, and, the moment his voice was heard, the wolf recognised him,\r\nand lavished on his old friend the most affectionate caresses. A second\r\nseparation followed, which lasted three years, and again the\r\nlong-remembered voice was recognised, and replied to with impatient\r\ncries; after which, rushing on his master, he licked his face with every\r\nmark of joy, menacing his keepers, towards whom he had just before been\r\nexhibiting fondness. A third separation occurred, and he became gloomy\r\nand melancholy. He suffered the caresses of none but his keepers, and\r\ntowards them he often manifested the original ferocity of his species.\r\n\r\nThese stories, however, go only a little way to prove that the dog and\r\nthe wolf have one common origin. [There are some naturalists that even\r\ngo so far as to state that the different varieties of dogs are sprung\r\nfrom, or compounded of, various animals, as the hyaena, jackal, wolf,\r\nand fox. The philosophic John Hunter commenced a series of experiments\r\nupon this interesting subject, and was forced to acknowledge that \"the\r\ndog may be the wolf tamed, and the jackal may probably be the dog\r\nreturned to his wild state.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient Cynegetical writers were not only acquainted with the cross\r\nbetween the wolf and dog, but also boasted the possession of breeds of\r\nanimals, supposed to have been derived from a connection with the lion\r\nand tiger. The Hyrcanian dog, although savage and powerful beast, was\r\nrendered much more formidable in battle, or in conflict with other\r\nanimals, by his fabled cross with the tiger. In corroboration of this\r\nsingular, but not less fabulous belief, Pliny states that the\r\ninhabitants of India take pleasure in having dog bitches lined by the\r\nwild tigers, and to facilitate this union, they are in the habit of\r\ntieing them when in heat out in the woods, so that the male tigers may\r\nvisit them. (See L. 8, c. xl.)\r\n\r\nThere is, however, but little doubt that the wolf and dog are varieties\r\nof the same family, as they can he bred together, and their offspring\r\ncontinuing the cross thus formed, will produce a race quite distinct\r\nfrom the original. French writers do not hesitate at all upon this\r\npoint, but even assert that it is very difficult to take a she-wolf with\r\nmale dogs during the period of oestrum, parceque la veulent saillir et\r\ncovrir comme une chienne.\r\n\r\nBaudrillart, in the \"dictionaire des chasses,\" further remarks that the\r\nmongrels produced by this connection are very viciously disposed and\r\ninclined to bite.\r\n\r\nThe period of utero-gestation, and the particular mode of copulation in\r\nthe wolf, is the same as that of the canine family, which two\r\ncircumstances are certainly very strong presumptive evidences of the\r\nsimilarity of the species. The dogs used by our northern Indians\r\nresemble very much, in their general appearance, the wolves of that\r\nregion, and do not seem very far removed from that race of animals,\r\nnotwithstanding they have been in a state of captivity, or\r\ndomestication, beyond the traditionary chronicles of this rude people.\r\n\r\nAnother strong circumstance in favour of the common origin of these two\r\nquadrupeds, is the existence in our own country of the Canis Latrans, or\r\nprairie wolf, who whines and barks in a manner so similar to the smaller\r\nvarieties of dogs, that it is almost impossible to distinguish his notes\r\nfrom those of the terrier.\r\n\r\nMajor Long remarks that \"this animal which does not seem to be known to\r\nnaturalists, unless it should prove to be the Mexicanus, is most\r\nprobably the original of the domestic dog, so common in the villages of\r\nthe Indians of this region, some of the varieties of which still remain\r\nmuch of the habit and manners of this species.\" (Vol. i, page 174.)\r\n\r\nIf further proof be necessary to establish the identity of the dog and\r\nwolf, the circumstances related by Captain Parry in his first voyage of\r\ndiscovery, ought to be sufficient to convince every mind that the wolf,\r\neven in its wild state, will seek to form an alliance or connection with\r\none of our domestic dogs.\r\n\r\n  \"About this time it had been remarked that a white setter dog,\r\n  belonging to Mr. Beverly, had left the Griper for several nights past\r\n  at the same time, and had regularly returned after some hours absence.\r\n  As the daylight increased we had frequent opportunities of seeing him\r\n  in company with a she-wolf, with whom he kept up an almost daily\r\n  intercourse for several weeks, till at length he returned no more to\r\n  the ships; having either lost his way by rambling to too great a\r\n  distance, or what is more likely, perhaps, been destroyed by the male\r\n  wolves. Some time after a large dog of mine, which was also getting\r\n  into the habit of occasionally remaining absent for some time,\r\n  returned on board a good deal lacerated and covered with blood,\r\n  having, no doubt, maintained a severe encounter with a male wolf, whom\r\n  we traced to a considerable distance by the tracks on the snow. An old\r\n  dog, of the Newfoundland breed, that we had on board the Hecla, was\r\n  also in the habit of remaining out with the wolves for a day or two\r\n  together, and we frequently watched them keeping company on the most\r\n  friendly terms.\"\r\n  (Page 136, 1st voyage.)\r\n\r\n[In volume 1st, page 111, of the Menageries, it is stated that Mr.\r\nWombwell exhibited in October, 1828, two animals from a cross between\r\nthe wolf and the domestic dog, which had been bred in that country. They\r\nwere confined in the same den with a female setter, and were likely\r\nagain to multiply the species. Mr. Daniel remarks that Mr. Brook, famous\r\nfor his menagerie, turned a wolf to a Pomeranian bitch at heat; the\r\ncongress was immediate, and, as usual between the dog and bitch, ten\r\npuppies were the produce. These animals strongly resembled their sire\r\nboth in appearance and disposition, and one of them being let loose at a\r\ndeer, instantly caught at the animal's throat and killed it. (See\r\nDaniel's Rural Sports, vol. i, page 14.)--L.]\r\n\r\nIt may appear singular that in both the Old Testament and the New the\r\ndog was spoken of almost with abhorrence. He ranked among the unclean\r\nbeasts. The traffic in him and the price of him were considered as an\r\nabomination, and were forbidden to be offered in the sanctuary in the\r\ndischarge of any vow. [2]\r\n\r\nOne grand object in the institution of the Jewish ritual was to preserve\r\nthe Israelites from the idolatry which at that time prevailed among\r\nevery other people. Dogs were held in considerable veneration by the\r\nEgyptians, from whose tyranny the Israelites had just escaped. Figures\r\nof them appeared on the friezes of most of the temples, [3] and they\r\nwere regarded as emblems of the Divine Being. Herodotus, speaking of the\r\nsanctity in which some animals were held by the Egyptians, says that the\r\npeople of every family in which a dog died, shaved themselves--their\r\nexpression of mourning--and he adds, that \"this was a custom existing in\r\nhis own time.\" [4]\r\n\r\nThe cause of this attachment to and veneration for the dog is, however,\r\nexplained in a far more probable and pleasing way than many of the\r\nfables of ancient mythology. The prosperity of Lower Egypt, and almost\r\nthe very subsistence of its inhabitants, depended on the annual\r\noverflowing of the Nile; and they looked for it with the utmost anxiety.\r\nIts approach was announced by the appearance of a certain star--SIRIUS.\r\nAs soon as that star was seen above the horizon, they hastened to remove\r\ntheir flocks to the higher ground, and abandoned the lower pastures to\r\nthe fertilizing influence of the stream. They hailed it as their guard\r\nand protector; and, associating with its apparent watchfulness the\r\nwell-known fidelity of the dog, they called it the \"dog-star,\" and they\r\nworshipped it. It was in far later periods and in other countries that\r\nthe appearance of the dog-star was regarded as the signal of\r\ninsufferable heat or prevalent disease.\r\n\r\nOne of the Egyptian deities--Anubis--is described as having the form and\r\nbody of a man, but with a dog's head. These were types of sagacity and\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\n  [\"Who knows not that infatuate Egypt finds\r\n  Gods to adore in brutes of basest kinds?\r\n  This at the crocodile's resentment quakes,\r\n  While that adores the ibis, gorged with snakes!\r\n  And where the radiant beam of morning rings\r\n  On shattered Memnon's still harmonious strings;\r\n  And Thebes to ruin all her gates resigns,\r\n  Of huge baboon the golden image shines!\r\n  To _mongrel curs_ infatuate cities bow,\r\n  And cats and fishes share the frequent vow!\"\r\n\r\n  Juvenal, 'Sat. xv'.--Badham's Trans.--L.]\r\n\r\nIn Ethiopia, not only was great veneration paid to the dog, but the\r\ninhabitants used to elect a dog as their king. He was kept in great\r\nstate, and surrounded by a numerous train of officers and guards. When\r\nhe fawned upon them, he was supposed to be pleased with their\r\nproceedings: when he growled, he disapproved of the manner in which\r\ntheir government was conducted. These indications of his will were\r\nimplicitly obeyed, or rather, perhaps, dictated.\r\n\r\n[Among the many strange and wonderful things mentioned by Pliny as being\r\ndiscovered in Africa, is a people called Ptoembati or Ptremphanae, whose\r\nprincipal city is Aruspi, where they elect a dog for their king and obey\r\nhim most religiously, being governed entirely by the different motions\r\nof his body, which they interpret according to certain signs. (See\r\nPliny, lib. vi, c. xxx.)--L.]\r\n\r\nEven a thousand years after this period the dog was highly esteemed in\r\nEgypt for its sagacity and other excellent qualities; for, when\r\nPythagoras, after his return from Egypt, founded a new sect in Greece,\r\nand at Croton, in southern Italy, he taught, with the Egyptian\r\nphilosophers, that, at the death of the body, the soul entered into that\r\nof different animals. He used, after the decease of any of his favourite\r\ndisciples, to cause a dog to be held to the mouth of the dying man, in\r\norder to receive his departing spirit; saying, that there was no animal\r\nthat could perpetuate his virtues better than that quadruped.\r\n\r\nIt was in order to present the Israelites from errors and follies like\r\nthese, and to prevent the possibility of this species of idolatry being\r\nestablished, that the dog was afterward regarded with utter abhorrence\r\namong the Jews. [5] This feeling prevailed during the continuance of the\r\nIsraelites in Palestine. Even in the New Testament the Apostle warns\r\nthose to whom he wrote to \"beware of dogs and evil-workers;\" [6] and it\r\nis said in The Revelations that \"without are dogs and sorcerers,\" &c.\r\n[7] Dogs were, however, employed even by the Jews. Job says, \"Now they\r\nthat are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have\r\ndisdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.\" [8] Dogs were employed\r\neither to guide the sheep or to protect them from wild beasts; and some\r\nprowled about the streets at night, contending with each other for the\r\noffal that was thrown away.\r\n\r\nTo a certain degree this dislike of the dog continues to the present\r\nday; for, with few exceptions, the dog is seldom the chosen companion of\r\nthe Jew, or even the inmate of his house. Nor was it originally confined\r\nto Palestine. Wherever a knowledge of the Jewish religion spread, or any\r\nof its traditions were believed, there arose an abhorrence of the dog.\r\nThe Mohammedans have always regarded him as an unclean animal, that\r\nshould never be cherished in any human habitation--belonging to no\r\nparticular owner, but protecting the street [9] and the district rather\r\nthan the house of a master.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos regard him likewise as unclean, and submit to various\r\npurifications if they accidentally come in contact with him, believing\r\nthat every dog was animated by a wicked and malignant spirit, condemned\r\nto do penance in that form for crimes committed in a previous state of\r\nexistence. If by chance a dog passed between a teacher and his pupil\r\nduring the period of instruction, it was supposed that the best lesson\r\nwould be completely poisoned, and it was deemed prudent to suspend the\r\ntuition for at least a day and a night.  Even in Egypt, dogs are now as\r\nmuch avoided as they were venerated. In every Mohammedan and Hindoo\r\ncountry, the most scurrilous epithet bestowed on a European or a\r\nChristian is--\"a dog!\" [10]\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the singular fact that in the whole of the Jewish\r\nhistory there is not a single allusion to hunting with dogs. Mention is\r\nmade of nets and snares, but the dog seems to have been never used in\r\nthe pursuit of game.\r\n\r\nIn the early periods of the history of other countries this seems to\r\nhave been the case even where the dog was esteemed and valued, and had\r\nbecome the companion, the friend, and the defender of man and his home.\r\nSo late as the second century of the Christian era, the fair hunting of\r\nthe present day needed the eloquent defence of Arrian, who says that\r\n\"there is as much difference between a fair trial of speed in a good\r\nrun, and ensnaring a poor animal without an effort, as between the\r\nsecret piratical assaults of robbers at sea, and the victorious naval\r\nengagements of the Athenians at Artemisium and at Salamis.\" [11] The\r\nfirst hint of the employment of the dog in the pursuit of other animals\r\nis given by Oppian in his Cynegeticus, who attributes it to Pollux,\r\nabout 200 years after the promulgation of the Levitical law.\r\n\r\nOf the precise species of dog that prevailed or was cultivated in Greece\r\nat this early period, little can with certainty be affirmed. One\r\nbeautiful piece of sculpture has been preserved, and is now in the\r\npossession of Lord Feversham at Duncombe Hall. It is said to represent\r\nthe favourite dog of Alcibiades, and to have been the production of\r\nMyson, one of the most skillful artists of ancient times. It differs but\r\nlittle from the Newfoundland dog of the present day. He is represented\r\nas sitting on his haunches, and earnestly looking at his master. Any one\r\nwould vouch for the sagacity and fidelity of that animal.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum contains a group of greyhound puppies of more recent\r\ndate, from the ruins of the villa of Antoninus, near Rome. One is\r\nfondling the other; and the attitude of both, and the characteristic\r\npuppy-clumsiness of their limbs, which indicate, nevertheless, the\r\nbeautiful proportions that will soon be developed, are an admirable\r\nspecimen of ancient art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration of ancient sculpture of greyhounds]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, in the earlier periods of their history, depended too much\r\non their nets; and it was not until later times that they pursued their\r\nprey with dogs, and then not with dogs that ran by sight, or succeeded\r\nby their swiftness of foot, but by beagles very little superior to those\r\nof modern days [12]. Of the stronger and more ferocious dogs there is,\r\nhowever, occasional mention. The bull-dog of modern date does not excel\r\nthe one (possibly of nearly the same race) that was presented to\r\nAlexander the Great, and that boldly seized a ferocious lion, or another\r\nthat would not quit his hold, although one leg and then another was cut\r\noff.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult and foreign to the object of this work fully to\r\ntrace the early history of the dog. Both in Greece and in Rome he was\r\nhighly estimated. Alexander built a city in honour of a dog; and the\r\nEmperor Hadrian decreed the most solemn rites of sepulture to another on\r\naccount of his sagacity and fidelity.\r\n\r\nThe translator of Arrian imagines that the use of the 'pugnaces'\r\n(fighting) and the 'sagaces' (intelligent)--the more ferocious dogs, and\r\nthose who artfully circumvented and caught their prey--was known in the\r\nearlier periods of Greek and Roman history, but that the 'celeres', the\r\ndogs of speed, the greyhounds of every kind, were peculiar to the\r\nBritish islands, or to the western and northern continents of Europe,\r\nthe interior and the produce of which were in those days unknown to the\r\nGreeks and Romans. By most authors who have inquired into the origin of\r\nthese varieties of the dog, the 'sagaces' have been generally assigned\r\nto Greece--the 'pugnaces' to Asia--and the 'celeres' to the Celtic\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n[The vertragi, 'canes celeres', or dogs that hunted by sight alone, were\r\nnot known to the ancients previous to the time of the younger Xenophon,\r\nwho then describes them as novelties just introduced into Greece:\r\n\r\n  \"But the swift-footed Celtic hounds are called in the Celtic tongue\r\n  [Greek: ouéztragoi]; not deriving their name from any particular\r\n  nation, like the Cretan, Carian, or Spartan dogs, but, as some of the\r\n  Cretans are named [Greek: diaponoi] from working hard, [Greek: itamai]\r\n  from their keenness, and mongrels from their being compounded of both,\r\n  so these Celts are named from their swiftness. In figure, the most\r\n  high-bred are a prodigy of beauty; their eyes, their hair, their\r\n  colour, and bodily shape throughout. Such brilliancy of gloss is there\r\n  about the spottiness of the parti-coloured, and in those of uniform\r\n  colour, such glistening over the sameness of tint, as to afford a most\r\n  delightful spectacle to an amateur of coursing.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable these dogs were carried, about this time, into the\r\nsouthern parts of Europe by the various tribes of Celts who over-ran the\r\ncontinent, and also occupied Ireland, Britain, and the other western\r\nislands, and ultimately took possession of Gaul.--L.]\r\n\r\nOf the aboriginal country of the latter there can be little doubt; but\r\nthe accounts that are given of the English mastiff at the invasion of\r\nBritain by the Romans, and the early history of the English hound, which\r\nwas once peculiar to this country, and at the present day degenerates in\r\nevery other, would go far to prove that these breeds also are indigenous\r\nto our island.\r\n\r\nOppian thus describes the hunting dog as he finds him in\r\nBritain:\r\n\r\n  \"There is, besides, an excellent kind of scenting dogs, though small,\r\n  yet worthy of estimation. They are fed by the fierce nation of painted\r\n  Britons, who call them 'agasoei'. In size they resemble worthless\r\n  greedy house-dogs that gape under tables. They are crooked, lean,\r\n  coarse-haired, and heavy-eyed, but armed with powerful claws and\r\n  deadly teeth. The 'agasoeus' is of good nose and most excellent in\r\n  following scent [13].\"\r\n\r\nAmong the savage dogs of ancient times were the Hyrcanian, said, on\r\naccount of their extreme ferocity, to have been crossed with the tiger\r\n[14],--the Locrian, chiefly employed in hunting the boar,--the\r\nPannonian, used in war as well as in the chase, and by whom the first\r\ncharge on the enemy was always made,--and the Molossian, of Epirus,\r\nlikewise trained to war as well as to the honours of the amphitheatre\r\nand the dangers of the chase. This last breed had one redeeming\r\nquality--an inviolable attachment to their owners. This attachment was\r\nreciprocal; for it is said that the Molossi used to weep over their\r\nfaithful quadruped companions slain in war.\r\n\r\n[Of all the dogs of the ancients, those bred on the continent of Epirus\r\nwere the most esteemed, and more particularly those from a southern\r\ndistrict called Molossia, from which they received their name.\r\n\r\nThese animals are described as being of enormous size, great courage and\r\npowerful make, and were considered worthy not only to encounter the\r\nwolf, bear, and boar, but often overcame the panther, tiger, and lion,\r\nboth in the chase and amphitheatre. They also, being trained to war,\r\nproved themselves most useful auxiliaries to this martial people.\r\n\r\nThe learned translator of Arrian states that\r\n\r\n  \"the fabled origin of this breed is consistent with its high repute;\r\n  for, on the authority of Nicander, we are told by Julius Pollux, that\r\n  the Epirote was descended from the brazen dog which Vulcan wrought for\r\n  Jupiter, and animated with all the functions of canine life.\"\r\n\r\nThese were not the only dogs fashioned by the skilful hands of the\r\nOlympic artist, as we find Alcinous, king of the Phaeacians, possessing\r\ngolden dogs also wrought at the celestial forge.\r\n\r\nPliny states that a dog of enormous magnitude was sent as a present by\r\nthe king of Albania to Alexander the Great when on his march to India;\r\nand \"that this monarch being delighted at the sight of so huge and fair\r\na dog, let loose unto him first bears, then wild boars, and lastly\r\nfallow deer, all of which animals he took no notice of, but remained\r\nperfectly unconcerned. This great warrior being a man of high spirit and\r\nwonderful courage, was greatly displeased at the apparent cowardice and\r\nwant of energy in so powerful an animal, and ordered him to be slain.\r\nThis news was speedily carried to the king of Albania, who thereupon\r\nsent unto him a second dog, stating that he should not make trial of his\r\ncourage with such insignificant animals, but rather with a lion or\r\nelephant, and if he destroyed this one also, he need not expect to\r\nobtain any other of this breed, as these two were all he possessed.\r\n\r\n  Tanta: suis petiere ultra fera semina sylvis,\r\n  Dat Venus accessus, et blando foedere jungit.\r\n  Tunc et mansuetis tuto ferus erat adulter\r\n  In stabulis, ultroque gravis succedere tigrim\r\n  Ausa canis, majore tulit de sanguine foetum.\r\n\r\n  'Gratii Falisci Cyneget.,' liv. 1. v. 160.\r\n\r\nAlexander being much surprised, made immediate preparations for a trial,\r\nand soon saw the lion prostrate, with his back broken, and his body torn\r\nin pieces by the noble dog. Then he ordered an elephant to be produced;\r\nand in no fight did he take more pleasure than in this. For the dog,\r\nwith his long, rough, shaggy hair, that covered his whole body, rushed\r\nwith open mouth, barking terribly, and thundering, as it were, upon the\r\nelephant. Soon after he leaps and flies upon him, advancing and\r\nretreating, now on one side, now on the other, maintaining an ingenious\r\ncombat; at one time assailing him with all vigour, at another shunning\r\nhim. So actively did he continue this artificial warfare, causing the\r\nhuge beast to turn around so frequently on every side to avoid his\r\nattacks, that he ultimately came down with a crash that \"made the earth\r\ntremble with his fall\". Book viii. chap. 40.\r\n\r\nThe Molossian dogs were at a later period much esteemed by the Romans as\r\nwatch dogs, not only of their dwellings, but also to guard their flocks\r\nagainst the incursions of wild animals. Horace, in the following lines,\r\npasses a just tribute to the worth of this animal, when referring to his\r\nwatchfulness, and the ardour with which he pursues those wild animals,\r\neven 'per altas nives,' that threaten the flocks entrusted to his care.\r\n\r\n  \"Quid immerentes, hospites vexas canis,\r\n    Ignarus adversum lupos?\r\n  Quin huc inanes, si potes, vertis minas,\r\n    Et me remorsurum petis?\r\n  Nam, qualis aut Molossus, aut fulvus Lacon,\r\n    Amica vis pastoribus,\r\n  Agam per altas aure sublatâ nives,\r\n    Quaecunpue praecedet fera.\"\r\n\r\n  'Epode' vi.--L.]\r\n\r\nÆlian relates that one of them, and his owner, so much distinguished\r\nthemselves at the battle of Marathon, that the effigy of the dog was\r\nplaced on the same tablet with that of his master.\r\n\r\nSoon after Britain was discovered, the 'pugnaces' of Epirus were pitted\r\nagainst those of our island, and, according to the testimony of Gratius,\r\ncompletely beaten. A variety of this class, but as large and as\r\nferocious, was employed to guard the sheep and cattle, or to watch at\r\nthe door of the house, or to follow the owner on any excursion of\r\nbusiness or of pleasure. Gratius says of these dogs, that they have no\r\npretensions to the deceitful commendation of form; but, at the time of\r\nneed, when courage is required of them, most excellent mastiffs are not\r\nto be preferred to them.\r\n\r\nThe account of the British 'pugnaces' of former times, and also of the\r\n'sagaces' and 'celeres', will be best given when treating of their\r\npresent state and comparative value. In describing the different breeds\r\nof dogs, some anecdotes will be related of their sagacity and fidelity;\r\na few previous remarks, however, may be admissible.\r\n\r\nA young man lost his life by falling from one of the precipices of the\r\nHelvellyn mountains. Three months afterwards his remains were discovered\r\nat the bottom of a ravine, and his faithful dog, almost a skeleton,\r\nstill guarding them. Sir Walter Scott beautifully describes the scene:\r\n\r\n  Dark-green was the spot, 'mid the brown mountain heather,\r\n    Where the pilgrim of nature lay stretched in decay;\r\n  Like the corpse of an outcast, abandoned to weather,\r\n    Till the mountain winds wasted the tenantless clay;\r\n    Nor yet quite deserted, though lonely extended,\r\n    For, faithful in death, his mute favourite attended,\r\n    The much loved remains of her master defended,\r\n      And chased the hill-fox and the raven away.\r\n    How long didst thou think that his silence was slumber?\r\n      When the wind waved his garments, how oft didst thou start?\r\n    How many long days and long weeks didst thou number\r\n      Ere he faded before thee, the friend of thy heart?\r\n\r\nBurchell, in his Travels in Africa, places the connexion between man and\r\nthe dog, and the good qualities of this animal, in an interesting point\r\nof view. A pack of dogs of various descriptions formed a necessary part\r\nof his caravan, occasionally to provide him with food, but oftener to\r\ndefend him from wild beasts or robbers.\r\n\r\n  \"While almost every other quadruped fears man as his most formidable\r\n  enemy,\" says this interesting traveller, \"there is one who regards him\r\n  as his companion, and follows him as his friend. We must not mistake\r\n  the nature of the case. It is not because we train him to our use, and\r\n  have made choice of him in preference to other animals, but because\r\n  this particular species of animal feels a natural desire to be useful\r\n  to man, and, from spontaneous impulse, attaches himself to him. Were\r\n  it not so, we should see in various countries an equal familiarity\r\n  with other quadrupeds, according to their habits, and the taste or\r\n  caprices of different nations; but, everywhere, it is the dog only\r\n  that takes delight in associating with us, and in sharing our abode.\r\n  It is he who knows us personally, watches over us, and warns us of\r\n  danger. It is impossible for the naturalist not to feel a conviction\r\n  that this friendship between creatures so different from each other\r\n  must be the result of the laws of nature; nor can the humane and\r\n  feeling mind avoid the belief that kindness to those animals, from\r\n  which he derives continued and essential assistance, is part of the\r\n  moral duty of man.\r\n\r\n  \"Often in the silence of the night, when all my people have been fast\r\n  asleep around the fire, have I stood to contemplate these faithful\r\n  animals watching by their side, and have learned to esteem them for\r\n  their social inclination towards mankind. When, wandering over\r\n  pathless deserts, oppressed with vexation and distress at the conduct\r\n  of my own men, I have turned to these as my only friends, and felt how\r\n  much inferior to them was man when actuated only by selfish views.\"\r\n\r\nOf the stanchness and incorruptible fidelity of the dog, and his\r\ndisregard of personal inconvenience and want, when employed in our\r\nservice, it is impossible to entertain a doubt. We have sometimes\r\nthought that the attachment of the dog to its master was increased, or,\r\nat least, the exhibition of it, by the penury of the owner. At all\r\nevents one fact is plain enough, that, while poverty drives away from us\r\nmany a companion of our happier hours, it was never known to diminish\r\nthe love of our quadruped friend.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the dog has been described, and the abomination in\r\nwhich he was held by the Israelites. At no great distance of time,\r\nhowever, we find him, almost in the neighbourhood of Palestine, in one\r\nof the islands of the Ionian Sea, the companion and the friend of\r\nprinces, and deserving their regard. The reader will forgive a somewhat\r\nabbreviated account of the last meeting of Ulysses and his dog.\r\n\r\nTwenty years had passed since Argus, the favourite dog of Ulysses, had\r\nbeen parted from his master. The monarch at length wended his way\r\nhomewards, and, disguised as a beggar, for his life would have been\r\nsacrificed had he been known, stood at the entrance of his palace-door.\r\nThere he met with an old dependant, who had formerly served him with\r\nfidelity and who was yet faithful to his memory; but age and hardship\r\nand care, and the disguise which he now wore, had so altered the\r\nwanderer that the good Eumaeus had not the most distant suspicion with\r\nwhom he was conversing; but:\r\n\r\n  Near to the gates, conferring as they drew,\r\n  Argus the dog his ancient master knew,\r\n  And, not unconscious of the voice and tread\r\n  Lifts to the sound his ears, and rears his head.\r\n  He knew the lord, he knew, and strove to meet;\r\n  In vain he strove to crawl and kiss his feet;\r\n  Yet, all he could, his tail, his ears, his eyes\r\n  Salute his master, and confess his joys. [15]\r\n\r\n[Lord Byron, who had much experience and acquaintance with the canine\r\nfamily, was rather sceptical as regards the memory of this animal,\r\nhaving been, on one occasion, entirely forgotten by a favourite dog from\r\nwhom he was separated some considerable time, and in fact was most\r\nsavagely assailed by him, when on his return he attempted to caress him\r\nas he was wont to do in former times.\r\n\r\nThis unkind reception at Newstead Abbey, on the part of his pampered\r\npet, may have given rise to the poet's feelings as embodied in the\r\nfollowing misanthropic lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"And now I'm in the world alone,\r\n  Upon the wide, wide sea:\r\n  But why should I for others groan,\r\n  When none will sigh for me?\r\n  Perchance my dog will whine in vain,\r\n  Till fed by stranger hands;\r\n  But long ere I come back again,\r\n  He'd tear me where he stands.\"--L.]\r\n\r\nIn Daniel's Rural Sports, the account of a nobleman and his dog is\r\ngiven. The nobleman had been absent two years on foreign service. On his\r\nreturn this faithful creature was the first to recognise him, as he came\r\nthrough the court-yard, and he flew to welcome his old master and\r\nfriend. He sprung upon him; his agitation and his joy knew not any\r\nbounds; and at length, in the fulness of his transport, he fell at his\r\nmaster's feet and expired.\r\n\r\n[An interesting circumstance, strongly exhibiting canine fidelity and\r\nattachment in a large mastiff, came under the Editor's own eye during\r\nhis childhood, and which, from its striking character, deserves to be\r\nrecorded on the page of history as another testimony to the high moral\r\nworth of these useful animals.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of Baltimore, with his family, lived during a portion of the\r\nyear a short distance in the country, and was in the habit of returning\r\nto the city late in the fall to pass the winter. On his estate there was\r\na fine young mastiff, who though extremely cross to strangers, exhibited\r\nat all times a great degree of tenderness and affection for the younger\r\nbranches of the family;--more particularly for the younger son, his most\r\nconstant companion, and who would often steal secretly away to share his\r\ndaily meal with this affectionate participator in his childish sports:\r\nor, when fatigued with romping together, would retire to the well-kept\r\nkennel, and recruit his limbs in a refreshing sleep, while reclining\r\nupon the body of the faithful dog. If the little truant should now be\r\nmissed by those having him in charge, the most natural question to ask\r\nwas, \"Where is Rolla?\" knowing full well that wherever this honest brute\r\nwas, there might his young master be found also. On such occasions,\r\nhowever, this trusty guardian would refuse all solicitations to abandon\r\nhis post, and express great dissatisfaction at any attempt to arouse or\r\ncarry off his young charge, whom he continued to watch over till he\r\nawoke, refreshed from his slumber and eager again to resume their\r\nfrolics.\r\n\r\nThe period of returning to the city at last arrived, and the dog\r\nexhibited marked signs of uneasiness, while the bustling preparations\r\nfor this end were going on, as if conscious of the separation that was\r\nabout to take place between his young master and himself, as also the\r\nother children, who had been his constant companions for so many joyful\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nEverything being completed, the childish group bid an affectionate adieu\r\nto the downcast Rolla, whom they left standing on the hill-top, watching\r\nthe carriage as it disappeared in the wood. A few days after their\r\ndeparture, and when this poor animal was forgotten in the new scenes\r\naround them, a communication was received from the overseer of the farm,\r\nin which he stated that the favourite dog appeared much grieved since\r\nthe family had left for the city, and was fearful that he might die if\r\nhe continued in the same condition. Little attention, however, was given\r\nto these remarks, all imagining that the dog's melancholy was only the\r\nresult of temporary distress, owing to his secluded life, so different\r\nfrom that which he had led when surrounded by the various members of a\r\nlarge family. Little did any one suppose that this poor neglected brute\r\nwas suffering the acutest pangs of mental distress, even sufficient to\r\nproduce death.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks had now elapsed since the separation from Rolla, when another\r\nmessage came from the overseer, stating that the dog would surely die\r\nwith grief, if not removed to the city, as he had refused all sustenance\r\nfor several days, and did nothing but wander about from place to place,\r\nformerly frequented by the children, howling and moaning in the most\r\npiteous manner.\r\n\r\nOrders were now given, much to the children's delight, for the\r\nconveyance of the favourite to the city; but, alas! this arrangement\r\ncame too late, as the poor creature sank from exhaustion, while in the\r\nwagon on his way to join those beloved companions whose short absence\r\nhad broken his heart and grieved him even unto death.--L.]\r\n\r\nWe will not further pursue this part of our subject at present. We shall\r\nhave other opportunities of speaking of the disinterested and devoted\r\naffection which this noble animal is capable of displaying when he\r\noccupies his proper situation, and discharges those offices for which\r\nnature designed him. It may, however, be added that this power of\r\ntracing back the dog to the very earliest periods of history, and the\r\nfact that he then seemed to be as sagacious, as faithful, and as\r\nvaluable as at the present day, strongly favour the opinion that he\r\ndescended from no inferior and comparatively worthless animal,--that he\r\nwas not the progeny of the wolf, the jackal, or the fox, but he was\r\noriginally created, somewhat as we now find him, the associate and the\r\nfriend of man.\r\n\r\nIf, within the first thousand years after the Deluge, we observe that\r\ndivine honours were paid to him, we can scarcely be brought to believe\r\nhis wolfish genealogy. The must savage animals are capable of affection\r\nfor those to whom they have been accustomed, and by whom they have been\r\nwell treated, and therefore we give full credit to several accounts of\r\nthis sort related of the wolf, the lion, and even the cat and the\r\nreptile: but in no other animal--in no other, even in the genus\r\n'Canis'--do we find the qualities of the domestic dog, or the slightest\r\napproach to them.\r\n\r\n  \"To his master he flies with alacrity,\" says the eloquent Buffon, \"and\r\n  submissively lays at his feet all his courage, strength, and talent. A\r\n  glance of the eye is sufficient; for he understands the smallest\r\n  indications of his will. He has all the ardour of friendship, and\r\n  fidelity and constancy in his affections, which man can have. Neither\r\n  interest nor desire of revenge can corrupt him, and he has no fear but\r\n  that of displeasing. He is all zeal and obedience. He speedily forgets\r\n  ill-usage, or only recollects it to make returning attachment the\r\n  stronger. He licks the hand which causes him pain, and subdues his\r\n  anger by submission. The training of the dog seems to have been the\r\n  first art invented by man, and the fruit of that art was the conquest\r\n  and peaceable possession of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Man,\" says Burns, \"is the God of the dog; he knows no other; and see\r\n  how he worships him. With what reverence he crouches at his feet--with\r\n  what reverence he looks up to him--with what delight he fawns upon\r\n  him, and with what cheerful alacrity he obeys him!\"\r\n\r\nIf any of the lower animals bear about them the impress of the Divine\r\nhand, it is found in the dog: many others are plainly and decidedly more\r\nor less connected with the welfare of the human being; but this\r\nconnexion and its effects are limited to a few points, or often to one\r\nalone. The dog, different, yet the same, in every region, seems to be\r\nformed expressly to administer to our comforts and to our pleasure. He\r\ndisplays a versatility, and yet a perfect unity of power and character,\r\nwhich mark him as our destined servant, and, still more, as our\r\ncompanion and friend. Other animals may be brought to a certain degree\r\nof familiarity, and may display much affection and gratitude. There was\r\nscarcely an animal in the menagerie of the Zoological Society that did\r\nnot acknowledge the superintendent as his friend; but it was only a\r\ncasual intercourse, and might be dissolved by a word or look. At the\r\nhour of feeding, the brute principle reigned supreme, and the companion\r\nof other hours would be sacrificed if he dared to interfere; but the\r\nconnexion between man and the dog, no lapse of time, no change of\r\ncircumstances, no infliction of evil can dissolve. We must, therefore,\r\nlook far beyond the wolf for the prototype of the dog.\r\n\r\nCuvier eloquently states that the dog exhibits the most complete and the\r\nmost useful conquest that man has made. Each individual is entirely\r\ndevoted to his master, adopts his manners, distinguishes and defends his\r\nproperty, and remains attached to him even unto death; and all this\r\nspringing not from mere necessity, or from constrain, but simply from\r\ngratitude and true friendship. The swiftness, the strength, and the\r\nhighly developed power of smelling of the dog, have made him a powerful\r\nally of man against the other animals; and, perhaps, these qualities in\r\nthe dog were necessary to the establishment of society. It is the only\r\nanimal that has followed the human being all over the earth.\r\n\r\nThere is occasionally a friendship existing between dogs resembling that\r\nwhich is found in the human being. The author pledges himself as to the\r\naccuracy of the following little anecdote. Two dogs, the property of a\r\ngentleman at Shrewsbury, had been companions for many years, until one\r\nof them died of old age. The survivor immediately began to manifest an\r\nextraordinary degree of restless anxiety, searching for his old\r\nassociate in all his former haunts, and refusing every kind of food. He\r\ngradually wasted away, and, at the expiration of the tenth day, he died,\r\nthe victim of an attachment that would have done honour to man.\r\n\r\nThe Dog, belongs to the division of animals termed VERTEBRATED, (see\r\n'The Horse', 2d edition, page 106), because it has a cranium or skull,\r\nand a spine or range of VERTEBRAE proceeding from it. It ranks under the\r\n'class' MAMMALIA, because it has teats, by which the female suckles her\r\nyoung; the 'tribe' UNGUICULATA, because its extremities are armed with\r\nnails; the 'order' DIGITIGRADES, because it walks principally on its\r\ntoes. The 'genus' CANIS has two tubercular teeth behind the large\r\ncarnivorous tooth in upper jaw; and the 'sub-genus familiaris', the DOG,\r\nhas the pupils of the eye circular, while those of the wolf are oblique,\r\nand those of the fox upright and long.\r\n\r\nThere has been some dispute whether the various species of dogs are of\r\ndifferent origin, or sprung from one common source. When we consider the\r\nchange that climate and breeding effect in the same species of dog, and\r\ncontrast the rough Irish or Highland greyhound with the smoother one of\r\nthe southern parts of Britain, or the more delicate one of Greece, or\r\nthe diminutive but beautifully formed one of Italy, or the hairless one\r\nof Africa or Brazil--or the small Blenheim spaniel with the magnificent\r\nNewfoundland; if also we observe many of them varied by accident, and\r\nthat accidental variety diligently cultivated into a new species,\r\naltogether different in form or use, we shall find no difficulty in\r\nbelieving that they might be derived from one common origin.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking proofs of the influence of climate on the form\r\nand character of this animal, occurs in the bull-dog. When transported\r\nto India he becomes, in a few years, greatly altered in form, loses all\r\nhis former courage and ferocity, and becomes a perfect coward.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that all dogs sprang from one common source, but climate,\r\nfood, and cross-breeding caused variations of form, which suggested\r\nparticular uses; and these being either designedly or accidentally\r\nperpetuated, the various breeds of dogs thus arose, and they have become\r\nnumerous in proportion to the progress of civilization. Among the ruder,\r\nor savage tribes, they possess but one form; but the ingenuity of man\r\nhas devised many inventions to increase his comforts: he has varied and\r\nmultiplied the characters and kinds of domestic animals for the same\r\npurpose, and hence the various breeds of horses, and cattle, and dogs.\r\n\r\nThe parent stock it is now impossible to trace; but the wild dog,\r\nwherever found on the continent of Asia, or Northern Europe, has nearly\r\nthe same character, and bears no inconsiderable resemblance to the\r\nBritish fox-dog, while many of those from the Southern Ocean can\r\nscarcely be distinguished from the English lurcher. There is, however,\r\nno more difficulty in this respect with regard to the dog, than any\r\nother of our domesticated animals. Climate, or chance, produced a change\r\nin certain individuals, and the sagacity of man, or, perhaps, mere\r\nchance, founded on these accidental varieties numerous breeds possessed\r\nof certain distinct characteristic properties. The degeneracy of the\r\ndog, also, in different countries, cannot for a moment be disputed.\r\n\r\nThe most natural arrangement of all the varieties of the dog is\r\naccording to the development of the frontal sinus and the cerebral\r\ncavity, or, in other words, the power of scent, and the degree of\r\nintelligence. This classification originated with M.F. Cuvier, and has\r\nbeen adopted by most naturalists. He reckoned three divisions of the dog:\r\n\r\nI. Those having the head more or less elongated, and the parietal bones\r\n   of the skull widest at the base, and gradually approaching towards\r\n   each other as they ascend, the condyls of the lower jaw being on the\r\n   same line with the upper molar teeth. The _Greyhound_ and all its\r\n   varieties belong to this class.\r\n\r\nII. The head moderately elongated, and the parietals diverging from each\r\n    other for a certain space as they rise upon the side of the head,\r\n    enlarging the cerebral cavity and the frontal sinus. To this class\r\n    belong our most valuable dogs,--the _Spaniel_, _Setter_, _Pointer_,\r\n    _Hound_, and the _Sheep-dog_.\r\n\r\nIII. The muzzle more or less shortened, the frontal sinus enlarged, and\r\n     the cranium elevated, and diminished in capacity. To this class\r\n     belong some of the _Terriers_, and a great many dogs that might\r\n     very well be spared.\r\n\r\nThis division of the different species of the dog is adopted here as\r\nbeing the most simple, intelligible, and satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gen. iv. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Deut. xxiii. 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In some of Belzoni's beautiful sketches of the frieze-work\r\nof the old Egyptian temples, the dog appears, with his long ears and\r\nbroad muzzle, not unlike the old Talbot hound.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Herodotus, lib. ii. c. 66.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: No dog was suffered to come within the precincts of the\r\nTemple at Jerusalem.  [Greek: Ex_o kunes] was a prevalent expression\r\namong the Jews.  Byrant's 'Mythology', vol. ii. p. 42.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Phil. iii. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Rev. xxii. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Job xxx. 1. See also Isaiah lvi, 10, 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Psalm lix. 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Carpenter's 'Scripture Natural History', p.109. It is a\r\nremarkable fact that from this faithful animal, the companion of man,\r\nand the guardian of his person and property, should originate as many\r\nterms of reproach as \"dog,\" \"cur,\" \"hound,\" \"puppy,\" \"dog-cheap,\" \"a\r\ndog's trick,\" \"dog sick,\" \"dog-weary,\" \"to lead the life of a dog,\" \"to\r\nuse like a dog.\" All this probably originated in the East, where the dog\r\nwas held in abhorrence as the common scavenger of the streets.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Arrian's 'Cynegeticus', cap 26.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: ''New Sporting Magazine, vol. xiv. p. 97.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Oppian's 'Cynegeticus', lib. i. v. 468-480.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14:\r\n\r\n  [\"At contrà faciles, magnique Lycaones armis.\r\n  Sed non Hyrcanæ satis est vehementia genti.\"]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Pope's 'Odyssey', xvii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VARIETIES OF THE DOG.\r\n\r\nFIRST DIVISION.\r\n\r\n  The head more or less elongated, the parietal bones widest at the base\r\n  and gradually approaching to each other as they ascend, and the\r\n  condyls of the lover jaw being on the same line with the upper molar\r\n  teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this division belong the greater number of the\r\n\r\nWILD DOGS.\r\n\r\nThe wild dog, as existing in considerable numbers or communities, seems\r\nto be nearly extirpated in the southern parts of Europe; but there are\r\nseveral cases on record, of dogs having assumed native independence. A\r\nblack greyhound bitch, belonging to a gentleman in Scarisbrick, in\r\nLancashire, though she had apparently been well broken in, and always\r\nwell used, ran away from the habitation of her master, and betook\r\nherself to the woods. She killed a great number of hares and made free\r\nwith the sheep, and became an intolerable nuisance to the neighbourhood.\r\nShe was occasionally seen, and the depredations that were committed were\r\nbrought home to her. Many were the attempts made to entrap or destroy\r\nher, but in vain: for more than six months she eluded the vigilance of\r\nher pursuers. At length she was observed to creep into a hole in an old\r\nbarn. She was caught as she came out, and the barn being searched three\r\nwhelps were found, which, very foolishly, were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe bitch evinced the utmost ferocity, and, although well secured,\r\nattempted to seize every one who approached her. She was, however,\r\ndragged home and treated with kindness. By degrees her ferocity abated.\r\nIn the course of two months, she became perfectly reconciled to her\r\noriginal abode, and, a twelve-month afterwards (1822), she ran\r\nsuccessfully several courses. There was still a degree of wildness in\r\nher appearance; but, although at perfect liberty, she seemed to be\r\naltogether reconciled to a domestic life.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 a dog was left by a smuggling vessel on the coast of\r\nNorthumberland. He soon began to worry the sheep for his subsistence,\r\nand did so much mischief that he caused very considerable alarm. He was\r\nfrequently pursued by hounds and greyhounds; but when the dogs came up\r\nhe lay upon his back as if supplicating for mercy, and in that position\r\nthey would never hurt him. He therefore lay quietly until the hunters\r\napproached, when he made off without being followed by the hounds until\r\nthey were again excited to the pursuit. He one day led them 30 miles in\r\nthis way. It was more than three months before he was caught and was\r\nthen shot [1].\r\n\r\nA dog with every character of the wild one has occasionally been seen in\r\nsome of the forests of Germany, and among the Pyrenean mountains; but he\r\nhas rarely been found gregarious there. In the country on the eastern\r\nside of the Gulf of Venice wild dogs are more frequent. They increase in\r\nthe Austrian and Turkish dominions, and are found on almost every part\r\nof the coast of the Black Sea, but even there they rarely gather in\r\nflocks: they do not howl in concert, as the wolf; nor are they the\r\nprecursors of other and larger beasts, like the jackal. Most of these\r\ndogs have the muzzle and head elongated, the ears erect, triangular, and\r\nsmall, the body and neck large and muscular, and the tail short, but\r\nwith a brush of crisped hair. In many parts of Arabia the wild dog--or\r\n'dakhun'--is occasionally found. In Persia, they are most decidedly\r\ncongregated together, and still more so in almost every part of India\r\n[2].\r\n\r\nMr. Hodgson has favoured the Zoological Society with an account of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILD DOG OF NEPAL,\r\n\r\nthe 'búánsú', and, finding it more or less prevailing through the whole\r\nof Northern India, and even southward of the coast of Coromandel, he\r\nthought that he had discovered the primitive race of the dog. This is a\r\npoint that can never be decided.\r\n\r\n  \"These dogs hunt their prey by night, as well as by day, in packs of\r\n  from six to ten individuals, maintaining the chase more by the scent\r\n  than by the eye, and generally succeeding by dint of strength and\r\n  perseverance. While hunting, they bark like the hound, yet the bark is\r\n  peculiar, and equally unlike that of the cultivated breeds of dogs,\r\n  and the cries of the jackal and the fox.\"\r\n\r\nBishop Heber gives the following account of them.\r\n\r\n  \"They are larger and stronger than a fox, which in the circumstances\r\n  of form and fur they much resemble. They hunt, however, in packs, give\r\n  tongue like dogs, and possess an exquisite scent. They make of course\r\n  tremendous havoc among the game in these hills; but that mischief they\r\n  are said amply to repay by destroying wild beasts, and even tigers.\"\r\n  [3]\r\n\r\nWild dogs are susceptible of certain social combinations. In Egypt,\r\nConstantinople, and throughout the whole of the East, there are in every\r\nvillage troops of wandering dogs who belong to no particular person.\r\nEach troop has its own quarter of the place; and if any wander into a\r\nquarter which does not belong to him, its inhabitants unite together and\r\nchase him out. At the Cape of Good Hope there are many dogs\r\nhalf-starved. On going from home the natives induce two or more of these\r\nanimals to accompany them, warn them of the approach of any ferocious\r\nanimal, and if any of the jackals approach the walls during the night,\r\nthey utter the most piercing cries, and at this signal every dog sallies\r\nout, and, uniting together, put the jackals to speedy flight. [4]\r\n\r\nThe wild Nepal dogs caught when at an adult age make no approach towards\r\ndomestification; but a young one, which Mr. Hodgson obtained when it was\r\nnot more than a month old, became sensible to caresses, and manifested\r\nas much intelligence as any sporting dog of the same age. [5]\r\n\r\nCaptain T. Williamson gives an interesting account of the ferocious\r\ncharacter of some of these wild dogs.\r\n\r\n  \"They have considerable resemblance to the jackal in form. They are\r\n  remarkably savage, and frequently will approach none but their\r\n  'doonahs' or keepers, not allowing their own masters to come near\r\n  them. Some of them are very fleet; but they are not to be depended\r\n  upon in coursing; for they are apt suddenly to give up the chase when\r\n  it is a severe one, and, indeed, they will too often prefer a sheep or\r\n  a goat to a hare. In hog-hunting they are more valuable. It seems to\r\n  suit their temper, and they appear to enjoy the snapping and the\r\n  snarling, incident to that species of sports.\"\r\n\r\nHe says that many persons affect to treat the idea of degeneration in\r\nquadrupeds with ridicule; but all who have been any considerable time\r\nresident in India must be satisfied that dogs of European breed become,\r\nafter every successive generation, more and more similar to the pariah,\r\nor indigenous dog of that country. The hounds are the most rapid in\r\ntheir decline, and, except in the form of their ears, they are very much\r\nlike many of the village curs. Greyhounds and pointers also rapidly\r\ndecline, although with occasional exceptions. Spaniels and terriers\r\ndeteriorate less, and spaniels of eight or nine generations, and without\r\na cross from Europe, are not only as good as, but far more beautiful\r\nthan, their ancestors. The climate is too severe for mastiffs, and they\r\ndo not possess sufficient stamina; but, crossed by the East Indian\r\ngreyhound, they are invaluable in hunting the hog [6].\r\n\r\nColonel Sykes, at one of the meetings of the Zoological Society,\r\nproduced a specimen of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILD DOG OF DAKHUN\r\n\r\nor Deccan, a part of India far to the south of Nepâl, and gave the\r\nfollowing description of this supposed primitive dog:\r\n\r\n  \"Its head is compressed and elongated, but its muzzle not very sharp.\r\n  The eyes are oblique, the pupils round, and the 'irides' light-brown.\r\n  The expression of the countenance is that of a coarse ill-natured\r\n  Persian greyhound, without any resemblance to the jackal, the fox, or\r\n  the wolf. The ears are long, erect, and somewhat rounded at the top.\r\n  The limbs remarkably large and strong in relation to the bulk of the\r\n  animal. The size is intermediate between the wolf and the jackal. The\r\n  neck long, the body elongated, and the entire dog of a red-brown\r\n  colour. None of the domesticated dogs of Dakhun are common in Europe,\r\n  but those of Dakhun and Nepâl are very similar in all their\r\n  characters. There is also a dog in Dakhun with hair so short as to\r\n  make him appear naked. It is called the 'polugar' dog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILD DOG OF THE MAHRATTAS\r\n\r\npossesses a similar conformation; and the fact is, that the East Indian\r\nwild dog is essentially the same in every part of that immense extent of\r\ncountry. There is no more reason, however, for concluding that it was\r\nthe primitive dog, than for conferring on the Indian cattle the same\r\nhonour among the ruminants. The truth of the matter is that we have no\r\nguide what was the original breed in any country. The lapse of 4000\r\nyears would effect strange alterations in the breeds.  The common name\r\nof this dog, in the track lying between South Bahar and the Mahratta\r\nfrontier towards Maghore, is\r\n\r\n\r\nDHOLE,\r\n\r\nthe 'Chryseus Scylex' of Hamilton Smith.\r\n\r\nCaptain Williamson, in his Oriental Field Sports, gives the following\r\naccount of the Dholes:\r\n\r\n  \"They are to be found chiefly, or only, in the country from Midnapore\r\n  to Chamu, and even there are not often to be met with. They are of the\r\n  size of a small greyhound. Their countenance is enlivened by unusually\r\n  brilliant eyes. Their body, which is slender and deep-chested, is\r\n  thinly covered by a coat of hair of a reddish-brown or bay colour. The\r\n  tail is dark towards its extremity. The limbs are light, compact, and\r\n  strong, and equally calculated for speed and power. They resemble many\r\n  of the common pariah dogs in form, but the singularity of their colour\r\n  and marks at once demonstrates an evident distinction.\r\n\r\n  \"These dogs are said to be perfectly harmless if unmolested. They do\r\n  not willingly approach persons; but, if they chance to meet any in\r\n  their course, they do not show any particular anxiety to escape. They\r\n  view the human race rather objects of curiosity, than either of\r\n  apprehension or enmity. The natives who reside near the Ranochitty and\r\n  Katcunsandy passes, in which vicinity the 'dholes' may frequently be\r\n  seen, describe them as confining their attacks entirely to wild\r\n  animals, and assert that they will not prey on sheep, goats, &c.; but\r\n  others, in the country extending southward from Jelinah and\r\n  Mechungunge, maintain that cattle are frequently lost by their\r\n  depredations. I am inclined to believe that the 'dhole' is not\r\n  particularly ceremonious, but will, when opportunity offers, and a\r\n  meal is wanting, obtain it at the expense of the neighbouring village.\r\n\r\n  \"The peasants likewise state that the 'dhole' is eager in proportion\r\n  to the size and powers of the animal he hunts, preferring the elk to\r\n  every other kind of deer, and particularly seeking the royal tiger. It\r\n  is probable that the 'dhole' is the principal check on the\r\n  multiplication of the tiger; and, although incapable individually, or\r\n  perhaps in small numbers, to effect the destruction of so large and\r\n  ferocious an animal, may, from their custom of hunting in packs,\r\n  easily overcome any smaller beast found in the wilds of India.\r\n\r\n  \"They run mute, except that they sometimes utter a whimpering kind of\r\n  note, similar to that sometimes expressed by dogs when approaching\r\n  their prey. This may be expressive of their own gratification, or\r\n  anxiety, or may serve as a guide to other 'dholes' to join in the\r\n  chase. The speed of the 'dhole' is so strongly marked in his form as\r\n  to render it probable no animal in the catalogue of game could escape\r\n  him for any distance. Many of the 'dholes' are destroyed in these\r\n  contests; for the tiger, the elk, and the boar, and even many of the\r\n  smaller classes of game are capable of making a most obstinate\r\n  defence. Hence the breed of the 'dholes' is much circumscribed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIBET DOG.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett, in his scientific and amusing description of the Zoological\r\nGardens, gave the best account we have of this noble dog, and our\r\nportrait is a most faithful likeness of him. He is bred in the\r\ntable-land of the Himalaya mountains bordering on Thibet. The Bhoteas,\r\nby whom many of them are carefully reared, come down to the low\r\ncountries at certain seasons of the year to sell their borax and musk.\r\nThe women remain at home, and they and the flocks are most sedulously\r\nguarded by these dogs. They are the defenders of almost every\r\nconsiderable mansion in Thibet. In an account of an embassy to the court\r\nof the Teshoo Llama in Thibet, the author says, that he had to pass by a\r\nrow of wooden cages containing a number of large dogs, fierce, strong,\r\nand noisy. They were natives of Thibet, and, whether savage by nature or\r\nsoured by confinement, they were so impetuously furious that it was\r\nunsafe even to approach their dens. Every writer who describes these\r\ndogs, speaks of their noble size, and their ferocity, and antipathy to\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nIt is said, however, that the Thibet dog rapidly degenerates when\r\nremoved from its native country, and certainly the specimens which have\r\nreached the Zoological Gardens exhibited nothing of ferocity. The one\r\nthat was in that menagerie had a noble and commanding appearance; but he\r\nnever attempted to do any injury.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the Thibet dog is of a deep black, slightly clouded on the\r\nsides, his feet alone and a spot over each eye being of a full tawny or\r\nbright brown hue. He has the broad short truncated muzzle of the\r\nmastiff, and the lips are still more deeply pendulous. There is also a\r\nsingular general looseness of the skin on every part of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARIAH.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of this dog. There is a wild breed very\r\nnumerous in the jungles and in some of the lower ranges of the Himalaya\r\nmountains. They usually hunt in packs, and it is not often that their\r\nprey escapes them. They generally are very thin, and of a reddish-brown\r\ncolour, with sharp-pointed ears, deep chest, and tucked-up flanks. Many\r\npersons hunt with these dogs singly, and they are very useful. They\r\nbring the hog to bay, or indicate the course that he has taken, or\r\ndistract his attention when the sportsman is at hand.\r\n\r\nThere is also in every inhabited part of the country the poor desolate\r\npariah,--unowned by any one,--daring to enter into no house, but\r\nwandering about, and picking up a living in any way that he can. He is,\r\nhowever, of a superior race to the wild dog, and belongs to the second\r\nclass of the dog, although mentioned here in order that we may\r\naltogether quit the dog of India. They are neglected by the Hindoos; but\r\nthe Mohammedans of India, and other strangers, consider it an act of\r\ncharity to throw out occasionally a morsel of food to them. They are\r\nmost of them mongrels; but the benevolent Bishop Heber does them no more\r\nthan justice when he says that he\r\n\r\n  \"was forcibly struck at finding the same dog-like and amiable\r\n  qualities in these neglected animals as in their more fortunate\r\n  brethren in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Sykes says of these outcasts that among the pariahs is\r\nfrequently found the turnspit-dog. There is also a small petted variety\r\nof the pariah, usually of a white colour, and with long silky hair. This\r\nanimal is taught to carry flambeaux and lanterns.\r\n\r\nAccording to Captain Williamson, in some of the ditches of the Carnatic\r\nforts, alligators are purposely kept, and all the pariah dogs found in\r\nthe forts are thrown into the ditches as provision for these monsters.\r\nSome persons who have kept tigers in cages have adopted the same means\r\nof supply for their royal captives, putting the poor pariah through an\r\naperture made for the purpose in the cage; and they justify themselves\r\nby asserting that they thus get rid of a troublesome breed of curs, most\r\nof which are unappropriated, and which being numerous are very\r\ntroublesome to passengers, often wantonly biting them, and raising a\r\nyelling noise at night, that sets all attempts to rest at defiance.\r\n\r\nIt did not always happen that the tiger killed the pariah put into his\r\ncage.\r\n\r\n  \"I knew an instance,\" says Captain Williamson, \"of one that was\r\n  destined for the tiger's daily meal, standing on the defensive in a\r\n  manner that completely astonished both the tiger and the spectator. He\r\n  crept into a corner, and whenever the tiger approached seized him by\r\n  the lip or the neck, making him roar most piteously. The tiger,\r\n  however, impelled by hunger,--for all supply of food was purposely\r\n  withheld,--would renew the attack. The result was ever the same. At\r\n  length the tiger began to treat the dog with more deference, and not\r\n  only allowed him to partake of the mess of rice and milk furnished\r\n  daily for his subsistence, but even refrained from any attempt lo\r\n  disturb him. The two animals at length became reconciled to each\r\n  other, and a strong attachment was formed between them. The dog was\r\n  then allowed ingress and egress through the aperture; and, considering\r\n  the cage as his own, he left it and returned to it just as he thought\r\n  proper. When the tiger died he moaned the loss of his companion for a\r\n  considerable period.\"\r\n\r\nA wild variety exists in Sumatra.  It is described by Cuvier as\r\n\r\n  \"possessing the countenance of a fox, the eyes oblique, the ears\r\n  rounded and hairy, the muzzle of a foxy-brown colour, the tail bushy\r\n  and pendulous, very lively, running with the head lifted high, and the\r\n  ears straight.\"\r\n\r\nThis animal can scarcely be rendered tractable, and even when he is\r\napparently tamed can rarely be depended upon.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed through the Indian Archipelago, towards Australasia, we\r\nskirt the coast of Java. Every Javanese of rank has large packs of dogs\r\nwith which he hunts the muntjak, the deer of that country. The dogs are\r\nled in strings by the attendants until they scent the prey: they are\r\nthen unloosed, while the sportsmen follow, but not at the speed which\r\nwould distinguish the British sportsman. The animal is generally found\r\nat bay. The male muntjak usually exhibits considerable courage, and\r\nprobably several of the dogs have been wounded by his tusks. As soon as\r\nthey come up every gun is discharged, and the animal almost immediately\r\ndrops. At other times the mounted sportsmen attack them with a spear or\r\nsword. Generally, the muntjak does not go off like the stag in any\r\ndirect track, but takes a circular course, and soon returns to the spot\r\nwhence it was started. It perhaps makes several of these circles, and at\r\nlength entangles itself in a thicket, where it is secured.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are the indigenous breed of the island, the body lank, the\r\nears erect, ferocious in their disposition, and with very little\r\nattachment to their masters. Such is the account given of them by Dr.\r\nHorsfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DINGO, AUSTRALASIAN, OR NEW HOLLAND DOG.\r\n\r\nThe newly discovered southern continent was, and some of it still\r\ncontinues to be, overrun by the native wild dogs. Dampier describes\r\nthem, at the close of the last century, as\r\n\r\n  \"beasts like the hungry wolves, lean like so many skeletons, and being\r\n  nothing but skin and bone.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until the publication of Governor Phillip's voyage to Botany\r\nBay, that any accurate description or figure of this dog could be\r\nobtained. He approaches in appearance to the largest kind of shepherd's\r\ndog. The head is elongated, the forehead flat, and the ears short and\r\nerect, or with a slight direction forwards. The body is thickly covered\r\nwith hair of two kinds--the one woolly and gray, the other silky and of\r\na deep yellow or fawn colour. The limbs are muscular, and, were it not\r\nfor the suspicious yet ferocious glare of the eye, he might pass for a\r\nhandsome dog. The Australasian dog, according to M. Desmarest, resembles\r\nin form and in the proportion of his limbs the common shepherd's dog. He\r\nis very active and courageous, covered in some parts with thick hair\r\nwoolly and gray, in other parts becoming of a yellowish-red colour, and\r\nunder the belly having a whitish hue. When he is running, the head is\r\nlifted more than usual in dogs, and the tail is carried horizontally. He\r\nseldom barks. Mr. Bennett observes that\r\n\r\n  \"dogs in a state of nature never bark. They simply whine, howl, or\r\n  growl. The explosive noise of the bark is only found among those that\r\n  are domesticated.\"\r\n\r\nSonini speaks of the shepherds' dogs in the wilds of Egypt as not having\r\nthis faculty; and Columbus found the dogs which he had previously\r\ncarried to America, almost to have lost their propensity to bark.\r\n\r\nHe does, however, occasionally bark, and has the same kind of snarling\r\nvoice which the larger dogs generally have. The Australasian dogs that\r\nhave been brought to Europe have usually been of a savage and\r\nuntractable disposition.\r\n\r\nThere are several of the Australasian dogs in the gardens of the\r\nZoological Society of London. One of them has been an inmate of that\r\nestablishment nine years, others more than five years; but not an\r\nindividual has acquired the bark of the other dogs by which they are\r\nsurrounded. When a stranger makes his appearance, or when the hour of\r\nfeeding arrives, the howl of the Australasian is the first sound that is\r\nheard, and it is louder than all the rest.\r\n\r\nIf some of them have thrown off a portion of their native ferocity,\r\nothers retain it undiminished. A bitch and two of her whelps, nearly\r\nhalf grown--a male and female--had inhabited the same cage from the time\r\nthat the young ones were born. Some cause of quarrel occurred on a\r\ncertain night, and the two bitches fell upon the dog and perfectly\r\ndestroyed him. There was not a limb left whole. A stronger instance of\r\nthe innate ferocity of this breed could scarcely be given. Even in their\r\nnative country all attempts perfectly to domesticate them have failed;\r\nfor they never lose an opportunity to devour the poultry or attack the\r\nsheep. Every domesticated dog coming within their reach was immediately\r\ndestroyed. One that was brought to England broke his chain--scoured the\r\nsurrounding country--and, before dawn, had destroyed several sheep; and\r\nanother attacked, and would have destroyed, an ass, if he had not been\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nMr. Oxley, Surveyor-General of New South Wales, however, gives an\r\ninteresting account of the mutual attachment between two of the native\r\nand wild New Holland dingos.\r\n\r\n  \"About a week ago we killed a native dog, and threw his body on a\r\n  small bush. On returning past the same spot to-day, we found the body\r\n  removed three or four yards from the bush, and the female in a\r\n  dying-state lying close beside it: she had apparently been there from\r\n  the day the dog was killed. Being now so weakened and emaciated as to\r\n  be unable to move on our approach, it was deemed a mercy to despatch\r\n  her.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Van Diemen Land began to be colonized by Europeans, the losses\r\nsustained by the settlers by the ravages of the wild dogs were almost\r\nincredible. The districts infested by these animals were principally\r\nthose appropriated to sheep, and there was scarcely a flock that did not\r\nsuffer. It was in vain to double the number of shepherds, to watch by\r\nnight and by day, or to have fires at every quarter of the fold; for\r\nthese animals would accomplish their object by stratagem or by force.\r\nOne colony lost no fewer than 1200 sheep and lambs in three months;\r\nanother colony lost 700.\r\n\r\nThe ravagers were either the native wild dogs of the island, or those\r\nthat had escaped from their owners. They seemed to have apportioned the\r\ncountry into different districts, each troop having its allotted range.\r\nAt length the evil became so great that a general meeting of the\r\ncolonists was convened. The concluding sentences of the speech of\r\nLieutenant Hill forcibly express the extent of the evil.\r\n\r\n  \"The country is free from bush-rangers: we are no longer surrounded\r\n  and threatened by the natives. We have only one enemy left in the\r\n  field; but that enemy strikes at the very root of our welfare, and\r\n  through him the stream of our prosperity is tainted at its very\r\n  source.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonists were then few, but they cordially united in the endeavour\r\nto extirpate this formidable enemy; and, although the wild dog is still\r\nfound in the interior of the island, he is comparatively seldom seen,\r\nand his ravages have nearly ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANIS AUSTRALIS--KARÁRAHÉ, NEW ZEALAND DOG.\r\n\r\nA tradition exists in New Zealand of this dog having been given to the\r\nnatives two or three centuries ago by a number of divinities who made\r\ntheir descent on these shores, probably Juan Fernandez and his\r\ncompanions. The sagacious animal has, however, dwindled down to the\r\nlowest rank of his family, but ill usage has not altogether destroyed\r\nhis worth. In New Zealand he is the safeguard of every village. Should\r\nthe slightest alarm exist, he is the first to ascertain the cause of it,\r\nand many families have saved themselves by flight, or have taken arms in\r\nself-defence against the incursions of predatory bands. The New\r\nZealanders are therefore kind in their treatment of the dog, except that\r\nthey occasionally destroy him for his hide.\r\n\r\nThe name formerly given to the New Zealand dog was 'pero', which in\r\nsome measure substantiates the supposition of Juan Fernandez having\r\nvisited the country--'perro', in the Spanish language, being the\r\nname of a dog.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the northern parts of America. The races of wild\r\ndogs are there considerably limited, both in number and the districts\r\nwhich they occupy.\r\n\r\nIn the elevated sandy country north of the source of the Missouri,\r\ninhabited by the \"Stone\" and the \"Black Foot\" Indians, is a doubtful\r\nspecies of dogs--wolves they used to be called--who hunt in large packs\r\nand are exceedingly swift; whose bark is similar to that of the domestic\r\ndog, but who burrow in the ground, and eagerly run to their holes, when\r\nthe gun of the hunter is heard.\r\n\r\n[Our author evidently, in the above remarks, confounds the Louisiana\r\nmarmot, Arctomys Ludovicianus or Prairie dog, with the Canis Latrans of\r\nSay, as he certainly would not make us believe that such harmless\r\nanimals as the marmot should associate themselves in packs to hunt the\r\ndeer or other quadrupeds; neither would he tell us that so different an\r\nanimal as the Canis Latrans could burrow in the ground and retreat to\r\ntheir holes when surprised by the hunter. The Louisiana Marmot,\r\nimproperly called Prairie dog, is about sixteen inches long, and lives\r\nin extended villages or excavations surmounted by mounds. These\r\ncommunities often comprise several thousand inhabitants, whose sole food\r\nconsists in the scanty herbage surrounding the settlement, as they\r\nseldom extend their excursions beyond a half-mile from their burrows for\r\nfear of the wolves, and many other enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Canis Latrans, on the other hand, is quite a large and savage\r\nanimal, and frequently unites in bands to run down deer or buffalo\r\ncalves, but as for living under ground in burrows, it is quite out of\r\nreason to suppose such a thing possible with this quadruped, who\r\nsecretes himself in the depths of the forest, and appears on the open\r\nplain only when in pursuit of game.--L.] The habit of selecting large,\r\nopen, sandy plains, and burrowing there,  extends to the greater part of\r\nthe American wild dogs.\r\n\r\n[We have been credibly informed by several gentlemen, familiar with the\r\ncountry of Mexico, that there is a diminutive species of dog running\r\nwild, and burrowing in the ground as rabbits, in the neighbourhood of\r\nSanta Fe and Chihuahua. A gentleman who has seen these animals, states\r\nthat there is no doubt as to their identity, having met with them in a\r\nstate of domestication, when they exhibited all the actions and manners\r\nof a French lap dog, such as come from Cuba or other West India Islands.\r\n\r\nThey are of every variety of hue, and resort to their burrows whenever\r\ndisturbed in their natural haunts. What they subsist on it is difficult\r\nto say, as they are too harmless and insignificant to attack any other\r\nanimal beyond a mouse or a snail. They are represented as being very\r\ndifficult to tame, but when domesticated show no disposition to return\r\nto their former mode of life. The lady of the Mexican Minister, when in\r\nthis city, had one of these dogs as a boudoir pet; it was lively and\r\nbarked quite fiercely. We have not been able to ascertain whether they\r\nbark in their natural state. The breed of dog cultivated in China for\r\nfood alone, are fed entirely upon rice meal and other farinaceous\r\narticles, having no relish whatever for flesh or other strong\r\naliment.--L.]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of North America whole troops of horses are guarded and\r\nkept together by dogs. If any of the troop attempt to steal away, the\r\ndog will immediately fly after the horse, head him, and bring him back\r\nto his companions.\r\n\r\n[To show the necessity of having dogs for this purpose, as well as to\r\nguard the flocks of sheep, we need only mention that it is no uncommon\r\nthing for a Mexican to own several thousand horses, besides an immense\r\nnumber of cattle.\r\n\r\nMr. Kendall, in his Santa Fé expedition, states that the proprietress of\r\none hacienda, a widow, and comparatively poor when the wonderful wealth\r\nof her ancestors is considered, now owns fifty thousand horses and\r\nmules, beside herds of cattle and sheep, and that the pasture ground\r\nextended for fifty miles on either side of the road.\r\n\r\nOne of the former owners of this immense estate, a short time previous\r\nto the revolution, sent as a present to a Spanish colonel, just arrived\r\nwith his regiment of dragoons, a thousand white horses, nearly all of\r\nthe same age, and every one raised on this prolific hacienda.--L.]\r\n\r\nThe wild dogs abound in many parts of South America. In some of the\r\nforests on the banks of the Oronoko they multiply to an annoying degree.\r\nThe Cayotte of Mexico, described by some as a wolf, and bearing no\r\nslight resemblance to that animal, belongs to the South American wild\r\ndogs, as do also the Aguara dogs of every kind. These wanderers of the\r\nwoods are, however, diminished in numbers in every part of that\r\ncontinent, and are replaced by other kinds, many of which have been\r\nimported from Europe and domesticated.\r\n\r\n[There is no country in the world more cursed with worthless curs than\r\nthat of Mexico and the other southern republics; the cities and villages\r\nactually swarm with these animals, and produce no little vexation to\r\ntravellers, who speak of their eternal yelping and barking in the most\r\nindignant terms.\r\n\r\nMr. Kendall, on entering San Antonio, says,\r\n\r\n  \"From every house some half dozen Mexican curs would jump forth and\r\n  greet us with a chorus of yelps and barks, and before we had fairly\r\n  entered the town the canine hue and cry was general. Those who have\r\n  for the first time entered a Mexican town or city must have been\r\n  struck with the unusual number of dogs, and annoyed by their incessant\r\n  barking; but the stranger soon learns that they spend all their\r\n  courage in barks--they seldom bite.\"--L.]\r\n\r\nMany of the Indian tribes have succeeded in reclaiming the dog of the\r\nwoods, and have made him a useful although not a perfectly attached\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nThe dogs of the Falkland Islands, and the Indian North American dogs\r\ngenerally, are brown or gray-coloured varieties of the wild dog; but as\r\nthey are nearly exterminated, will occupy little space. It has already\r\nbeen stated that in Egypt and in Nubia we have the first records of the\r\ndog. Many superstitious notions were connected with him, and divine\r\nhonours were paid to him. Those times are passed away, and he is\r\nregarded with aversion by the Moslem of the present day. He is an\r\noutcast. He obtains a scanty living by the offal which he gathers in the\r\ntowns, or he is become a perfect wild dog, and scours the country for\r\nhis prey. His modern name is the 'deab'. He is of considerable size,\r\nwith a round muzzle, large head, small erect ears, and long and hairy\r\ntail, spotted with black, white, and yellow, and having a fierce wolfish\r\naspect. These dogs are not, however, numerous; but the mischief which\r\nthey do is often great, whether in pairs they burrow in the earth, or\r\nassociate with others and hunt in troops. [7]\r\n\r\nIn Nubia is a smaller dog of the same kind, which never burrows. It\r\nlives on small animals and birds, and rarely enters any of the towns. A\r\nsimilar dog, according to Colonel Hamilton Smith, inhabits the\r\nneighbourhood of the Cape, and particularly the Karroo or Wilderness. It\r\nis smaller than either of the others, and lives among bushes or under\r\nprominent rocks. Others, although not identified with the jackal, yet\r\nassociating with him, inhabit the Uplands of Gambia and Senegal.\r\n\r\nOn the Gold Coast, the dog is used and prized as an article of food. He\r\nis fattened and driven to market as the European drives his sheep and\r\nhogs. The dog is even more valued than the sheep for human subsistence,\r\nand is deemed the greatest luxury that can be placed even on the royal\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIn Loango, or Lower Guinea, is a town from which the African wild dogs\r\nderive their name--the 'dingo'. They hunt in large packs. They\r\nfearlessly attack even the elephant, and generally destroy him. In the\r\nneighbourhood of the Cape, the country is nearly cleared of wild beasts;\r\nbut in Cape Town there are a great number of lean and miserable dogs,\r\nwho howl about the streets at night, quitting their dens and\r\nlurking-places, in quest of offal. No great while ago, the wolves and\r\nhyaenas used to descend and dispute the spoil with the dogs, while the\r\ntown resounded with their hideous howlings all the night long.\r\n\r\nThis will be a proper place to refer to the numerous accounts that are\r\ngiven both in ancient and modern times of the immolation of dogs, and of\r\ntheir being used for food. They were sacrificed at certain periods by\r\nthe Greeks and Romans to almost all their deities, and particularly to\r\nMars, Pluto, and Pan, to Minerva, Proserpine, and Lucina, and also to\r\nthe moon, because the dog by his barking disturbed all charms and\r\nspells, and frightened away all spectres and apparitions. The Greeks\r\nimmolated many dogs in honour of Hecate, because by their baying the\r\nphantoms of the lower world were disturbed. A great number of dogs were\r\nalso destroyed in Samothrace in honour of the same goddess. Dogs were\r\nperiodically sacrificed in February, and also in April and in May; also\r\nto the goddess Rubigo, who presided over the corn, and the Bona Dea,\r\nwhose mysterious rites were performed on Mount Aventine. The dog\r\nCerberus was supposed to be watching at the feet of Pluto, and a dog and\r\na youth were periodically sacrificed to that deity. The night when the\r\nCapitol had nearly been destroyed was annually celebrated by the cruel\r\nscourging of a dog in the principal public places, even to the death of\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\n[As on a certain occasion, the dogs who had the Capitol in custody, did\r\nnot bark and give warning when the Gauls attempted to scale the wails,\r\nthere is a custom annually observed at Rome, to transfix certain dogs to\r\nforks, and thus crucified, hang them on an elder tree as examples of\r\njustice. (Book 29, chap. IV. Pliny.)-L.]\r\n\r\nMany of the Greek and Roman epicures were strangely fond of the flesh of\r\nthe dog, and those who ought to have known much better encouraged the\r\nuse of this food. Galen speaks of it in the strongest terms of praise.\r\nHippocrates says that the meat of old dogs is of a warm and dry quality,\r\ngiving strength to the eater. Ananias, the poet, speaks of dog's flesh\r\nserved up with that of the hare and fox. Virgil recommends that the\r\nfatted dog should be served up with whey or butter; and Dioscorides, the\r\nphysician, says that they should be fed on the whey that remains after\r\nthe making of cheese.\r\n\r\n[Independent of the many useful and interesting qualities that\r\nnecessarily endeared this animal to the ancients, he had yet stronger\r\nclaims upon them, in the prophylactic properties of different portions\r\nof his body. Pliny, Hippocrates, Aristotle and others, speak of various\r\npreparations made of his flesh, for the cure of many distempers. The\r\nfirst-mentioned writer observes, that the ashes of burnt dogs, made into\r\na liniment, with oil, will make an excellent application to the\r\neye-brows, to turn them black. We doubt not that an analogous compound,\r\nif proved to be really efficacious, might he introduced to the notice of\r\nthe belles of our own time, or meet with extensive sale for dyeing the\r\npagoties and mustachios of the modern dandy. This quaint philosopher\r\nalso recommends the same substance as a healing salve, for malignant\r\nwounds, and the internal use of the same article as a preventive or cure\r\nof hydrophobia and other distempers. (Book 28, chap, XI. and X.)--L.]\r\n\r\nBefore Christianity was established among the Danes, on every ninth year\r\nat the winter solstice, a monstrous sacrifice of 99 dogs was effected.\r\nIn Sweden the sacrifice was still worse. On each of 9 successive days,\r\n99 dogs were destroyed. This sacrifice of the dog, however, gave way to\r\none as numerous and as horrible. On every 9th year, 99 human victims\r\nwere immolated, and the sons of the reigning tyrant among the rest, in\r\norder that the life of the monarch might be prolonged. [8]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the dog was frequently the executioner; and, from an\r\nearly period, whether in the course of war or the mock administration of\r\njustice, thousands of poor wretches were torn to pieces by animals\r\ntrained to that horrible purpose.\r\n\r\nMany of the Indians of North America, and almost of the present day, are\r\nfond of the flesh of the dog.\r\n\r\nCaptain Carver, in his Travels in North America in 1766, 1767, and 1768,\r\ndescribes the admission of an Indian into one of the horrible societies\r\nof that country.\r\n\r\n  \"The dishes being brought near to me,\" says he, \"I perceived that they\r\n  consisted of dog's flesh, and I was informed that at all their grand\r\n  feasts they never made use of any other food. The new candidate\r\n  provides fat dogs for the festival, if they can be procured at any\r\n  price. They ate the flesh; but the head and the tongue were left\r\n  sticking on a pole with the front towards the east. When any noxious\r\n  disease appeared among them, a dog was killed, the intestines were\r\n  wound between two poles, and every man was compelled to pass between\r\n  them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nandowepia Indians also eat dog's flesh as an article of luxury, and\r\nnot from any want or scarcity of other animal food; for they have the\r\nbear, buffalo, elk, deer, beaver, and racoon.\r\n\r\nProfessor Keating, in his interesting work on the expedition to Peter's\r\nRiver, states that he and a party of American officers were regaled in a\r\nlarge pavilion on buffalo meat, and 'tepsia', a vegetable boiled in\r\nbuffalo grease, and the flesh of three dogs kept for the occasion, and\r\nwithout any salt. They partook of the flesh of the dogs with a mixture\r\nof curiosity and reluctance, and found it to be remarkably fat, sweet,\r\nand palatable, divested of any strong taste, and resembling the finest\r\nWelsh mutton, but of a darker colour. So strongly rooted, however, are\r\nthe prejudices of education, that few of them could be induced to eat\r\nmuch of it.\r\n\r\nThe feast being over, great care was taken to replace the bones in their\r\nproper places in the dish, after which they were carefully washed and\r\nburied, as a token of respect to the animals generally, and because\r\nthere was the belief among them that at some future time they would\r\nreturn again to life. Well-fattened puppies are frequently sold; and an\r\ninvitation to a feast of dog's meat is the greatest distinction that can\r\nbe offered to a stranger by any of the Indian nations east of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\n[Notwithstanding the Indians occasionally eat their dogs either through\r\nnecessity or when they wish to pay a marked tribute of respect to their\r\ngods, or prepare a feast of friendship with strangers, they value them\r\nvery highly, and do not by any means consider their flesh superior to\r\nthat of the buffaloes or other animals of the chase. Mr. Catlin remarks,\r\nthat \"the dog, amongst all Indian tribes, is more esteemed and more\r\nvalued than amongst any part of the civilized world: the Indian, who has\r\nmore time to devote to his company, and whose untutored mind more nearly\r\nassimilates to that of his faithful domestic, keeps him closer company\r\nand draws him nearer his heart: they hunt together and are equal sharers\r\nin the chase--their bed is one; and on the rocks and on their coats of\r\narms they carve his image as the symbol of fidelity.\" (Vol. I., p. 230.)\r\n\r\nOn visiting the Sioux, they prepared for this gentleman as a token of\r\nregard a dog feast, previous to partaking of which they addressed him in\r\na manner that plainly exhibits the veneration in which they held these\r\nfaithful animals, at the same time forcibly demonstrating the peculiar\r\ncircumstances under which they alone are willing to destroy them:\r\n\r\n\"My father, I hope you will have pity upon us; we are very poor. We\r\noffer you to-day not the best we have got; for we have a plenty of good\r\nbuffalo hump and marrow; but we give you our hearts in this feast, we\r\nhave killed our faithful dogs to feed you, and the Great Spirit will\r\nseal our friendship. I have no more to say.\" (Vol. I., p. 229.)--L.]\r\n\r\nAs a counterpart to much of this, the ancient Hyrcanians may be\r\nmentioned, who lived near the Caspian Sea, and who deemed it one of the\r\nstrongest expressions of respect to leave the corpse of their deceased\r\nfriends to be torn and devoured by dogs. Every man was provided with a\r\ncertain number of these animals, as a living tomb for himself at some\r\nfuture period, and these dogs were remarkable for their fierceness.\r\n\r\n[Not only the Hyrcanians but most of the people dwelling on or near the\r\nCaspian sea, preserved this race or a similarly formidable one, more\r\nparticularly to devour their dead; it being considered more propitiatory\r\nto the Gods, and more flattering to the spirits of the deceased, to make\r\nthis disposition of the corpse, than consigning it to the gloomy grave\r\nor funeral pile.\r\n\r\nThis custom is noticed by Theodoret as being pursued by the inhabitants\r\nof those parts, and was not abolished till after their adherence to\r\nChristianity.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTICATED DOGS OF THE FIRST DIVISION\r\n\r\nSome of the readers of this work may possibly recollect three beautiful\r\ndogs of this species in the gardens of the Zoological Society of London,\r\nwhich afforded a perfect illustration of the elongated head of the dogs\r\nbelonging to Cuvier's first section. Mr. Bennett, the Secretary of the\r\nSociety, gave an interesting account of them in 1835, derived from the\r\nobservation of Sir John Franklin and Dr. Richardson.\r\n\r\nThe elongation and sharpness of the muzzle, and the small capacity of\r\nthe skull, first attract attention. The dog was doubtless fitted for its\r\nsituation, where its duty is to hunt by sight after the moose or\r\nrein-deer, but would have been comparatively worthless if he was to be\r\nguided by the scent. Its erect ears, widened at the base and pointed at\r\nthe top, gave it an appearance of vivacity and spirit. Its depth of\r\nchest, and tucked-up flank, and muscular quarters, marked it as a dog of\r\nspeed, while its light frame, and the length of the toes, and wideness\r\nof web between them, seem to depict the kind of surface over which it\r\nwas to bound. It is not designed to seize and to hold any animal of\r\nconsiderable bulk; it bounds over the snow without sinking, if the\r\nslightest crust is formed upon it, and eagerly overtakes and keeps at\r\nbay the moose or the rein-deer until the hunters arrive. This animal\r\nfurnishes a beautiful illustration of adaptation for a particular\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe hair of these dogs is white, with patches of grayish-black and\r\nbrown. They are known only in the neighbourhood of the Mackenzie River\r\nand of the Great Bear Lake in North America They appear to be\r\ngood-tempered and easily manageable, and soon become familiar even with\r\nstrangers. They are most valuable to the Indians, who live almost\r\nentirely on the produce of the chase. In their native country they never\r\nbark, but utter a whine and howl resembling that of the Esquimaux dog;\r\nyet one of the three, who was born a few days after its parents arrived\r\nat the gardens, while it whined and howled occasionally with its\r\nparents, at other times uttered the perfect bark of its companions of\r\nvarious breeds around it.\r\n\r\n[It is the general belief among the Indians and others who are familiar\r\nwith this dog, that his origin is connected, in some way, with the\r\nArctic Fox, Canis Lagopus, as he so much resembles this animal in his\r\ngeneral appearance and habits.\r\n\r\nThis fox when taken is easily tamed, a few days of captivity being often\r\nsufficient to render him quite docile, and ample opportunities have thus\r\nbeen afforded for studying his peculiarities.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cross between the wolf and dog may be considered\r\nestablished beyond controversy, the testimony is not so very conclusive\r\nas regards the fox. The most authentic instances on record are perhaps\r\nthose mentioned by Mr. Daniel, who states that Mr. Tattersall had a\r\nterrier bitch, who bred by a fox, and the produce again had whelps by\r\ndogs, also that the woodman of Mongewell manor had a bitch, the\r\noffspring of a tame dog-fox, by a shepherd's cur, and she again had\r\npuppies by a dog; he does not state, however, that he knew these facts\r\npersonally; but concludes from these two instances, that the fox species\r\nmay be fairly added to the other supposed original stocks of dogs.\r\n(Daniel's Rural Sports, vol. 1. p. 15.)\r\n\r\nMr. Collinson also states, that it is certain that the Siberian dog not\r\nonly copulates with the wolf, but with the fox also. Notwithstanding\r\nthis assertion, he is not able to cite a single instance, but on the\r\nother hand is forced to acknowledge, that he never met with any person\r\nwho had seen the coupling of these two animals. The peasants of that\r\ncountry have a small dog, which, from their foxy appearance, they term\r\nfox-dogs. Our Indian dogs, also, resemble somewhat the wolves and foxes,\r\nthe original inhabitants of this continent, while the canine family\r\nthroughout the east is strongly marked with the jackal, the wild\r\naborigines of that portion of the world.\r\n\r\nThese dogs, when fighting, do not shake their antagonists, like the\r\nperfectly domesticated dog; their teeth are extremely sharp, and when\r\nsnarling, the skin is drawn from the mouth; their bite is more severe,\r\nand they show but little disposition to attack the wolves, although\r\nquite eager in the pursuit of all other game. The Indians had no dogs\r\nprevious to the coming of the whites, but depended in a great measure,\r\nwhen hunting, upon the presence of the wolves, who, by their howlings,\r\nindicated the position of the herds of buffalo or deer, knowing full\r\nwell that after the general carnage, they would come in for a full share\r\nof the garbage of these animals.\r\n\r\nHarlan, in his Fauna Americana, says,\r\n\r\n  \"we have very little doubt that the various species of domestic dogs\r\n  are mere varieties of prolific hybrids, produced by the union of the\r\n  wolf with the fox or jackal. A prolific hybrid of this kind once\r\n  produced, the progeny would more readily unite with the congeners of\r\n  either parent, and with each other, and in this manner give rise to\r\n  the innumerable varieties which at the present day are found scattered\r\n  over the face of the earth.\" (Page 77.)\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange, that no naturalist has, as yet, succeeded in\r\ncausing a union between the fox and dog, if the thing be possible. We\r\nourselves are cognizant of an instance, where every effort was made to\r\nproduce an offspring from such a connexion, but to no purpose, although\r\nthe terrier bitch was thrice in heat while confined with the fox, and\r\nlived on the most amicable terms with him. We agree with Doct. Godman,\r\nthat if a litter has ever been generated by these two animals, they were\r\nhybrids, as nothing to the contrary of an authentic character has been\r\nbrought forward, whereas it is well known that the fox always exhibits a\r\ngreat antipathy and instinctive repugnance to such an union. It is also\r\nreasonable to suppose that if prolific hybrids had at any time been\r\nproduced, the breed, from its singular character, would have been\r\npropagated by the fortunate possessor, either from curiosity or utility.\r\nThe intestines of the fox are shorter than those of the dog or wolf--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALBANIAN DOG\r\n\r\ncan be traced to a very remote period of history. Some of the old\r\nauthors speak of it as the dog which in the times of ancient mythology\r\nDiana presented to Procris. Pliny describes in enthusiastic terms the\r\ncombat of one of them with a lion, and afterwards with an elephant. A\r\ndog very much resembling the ancient stories is yet found in Albania,\r\nand most of the districts of Greece. He is almost as large as a mastiff,\r\nwith long and silky hair, the legs being shorter and stronger than those\r\nof the greyhound. He is gentle and tractable with those whom he knows,\r\nand when there is no point of duty at stake; but no bribe can seduce him\r\nfrom his post when any trust is committed to him.\r\n\r\n[This dog, it is very probable, was highly impregnated with molossian\r\nblood, and like that animal, was trained both for war and the chase. It\r\nis rather doubtful, whether the dogs presented to Alexander the Great by\r\nthe king of Albania, were those of his own country or some that he had\r\nobtained from other parts. We are inclined to believe that they were\r\nimported dogs, for Pliny distinctly states, that these two were all that\r\nthe generous monarch possessed, and if destroyed could not be replaced.\r\nFrom this circumstance it is natural to suppose that, if these dogs had\r\nbeen native Albanians, the king would have been able to supply any\r\nreasonable quantity of them, and, therefore, not necessitated to send\r\nthis message to Alexander. On the other hand, if these dogs had been of\r\nthe pure molossian type, such as were raised in Epirus, it is probable\r\nthat their huge dimensions would not have surprised this monarch so\r\nmuch, as it is reasonable to believe that Alexander would certainly have\r\nseen, if not heard, of dogs so remarkable, belonging to a kingdom in\r\nimmediate contiguity with his own. We are, therefore, forced to look to\r\nsome other source, from whence came these proud dogs, who alone deigned\r\nto contend with the lion and elephant, and must yield to Strabo, who\r\nstates that these animals were of the Indian breed.--L. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT DANISH DOG, CALLED ALSO THE DALMATIAN OR SPOTTED DOG.\r\n\r\nThe difference between these two breeds consists principally in the\r\nsize, the Dalmatian being much smaller than the Danish. The body is\r\ngenerally white, marked with numerous small round black or reddish-brown\r\nspots. The Dalmatian is said to be used in his native country for the\r\nchase, to be easily broken, and stanch to his work. He has never been\r\nthus employed in England, but is chiefly distinguished by his fondness\r\nfor horses, and as being the frequent attendant on the carriages of the\r\nwealthy. To that its office seems to be confined; for it rarely develops\r\nsufficient sense or sagacity to be useful in any of the ordinary offices\r\nof the dog.\r\n\r\n[This dog is, perhaps, the tallest of the canine species in existence;\r\nthe smaller Dane, or \"le braque de Bengal,\" of the French writers, is\r\nperhaps a cross of this animal with the pointer or hound, or the\r\noriginal dog degenerated by removal from his native soil. Although these\r\ndogs generally display little or no intelligence, and are, in fact,\r\ndenounced by many writers as being incapable of acquiring sufficient\r\nknowledge to make them in any way serviceable for hunting, still we are\r\nled to believe that these latent qualities might be developed in this\r\nbreed as well as any other of his particular physical construction.\r\n\r\nWe had a little Dane in our possession, whom we instructed, with little\r\ntrouble, in a variety of tricks; although at first surly and stupid, he\r\nsoon exhibited great aptness and pleasure in repeating the various\r\nlessons which we taught him. If he had been younger we might have given\r\nhim an opportunity of displaying himself in the field, as we are\r\nconfident, from his tractable disposition, that he might have been\r\ntutored, with perseverance, even sufficiently well to stand upon game.\r\nThe dogs of Epirus were supposed to have been spotted like the\r\nDalmatian, if not of the same breed. These dogs may also be the \"spotted\r\nhounds\" given by Pan to Diana.\r\n\r\nLet the little Dane's intellectual abilities be what they may, long\r\nhabit and association have so intimately connected him with the stable\r\nand its occupants that he seems no longer fit for any other purpose than\r\nthat of following in the wake of the carriages of the wealthy. This he\r\ndoes with peculiar fondness and singular ingenuity; for, although\r\nconstantly by the side or at the heels of the horses, or under the\r\ntongue of the vehicle, his sure retreat when attacked by other dogs, who\r\nseem to have an antipathy for these pampered and fancy attendants on the\r\naffluent, he seldom or never is trod upon, or otherwise injured.\r\n\r\nThe little Dane is often a good ratter; and a gentleman of this city\r\ninforms me that his dogs not only exhibit an attachment to horses in\r\ngeneral, but that one of them has a particular partiality for an old\r\ncarriage-horse, with whom he has been intimately associated for many\r\nyears, and always greets his return to the stable with every\r\ndemonstration of delight, by jumping up and kissing him, &c.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH MATIN.\r\n\r\n('Canis laniarius'). There is considerable difficulty in describing this\r\nvariety. The French consider it as the progenitor of all the breeds of\r\ndogs that resemble and yet cannot be perfectly classed with the\r\ngreyhound. It should rather be considered as a species in which are\r\nincluded a variety of dogs,--the Albanian, the Danish, the Irish\r\ngreyhound, and almost the pure British greyhound. The head is elongated\r\nand the forehead flat, the ears pendulous towards the tips, and the\r\ncolour of a yellowish fawn. This is the usual sheep-dog in France, in\r\nwhich country he is also employed as a house-dog. He discharges his duty\r\nmost faithfully; and, notwithstanding his flat forehead, shows himself\r\nto possess a very high degree of intelligence.\r\n\r\n[The French matin we have seen of every variety of colour, being mostly\r\npatched with brown, yellow, grey, black, or white. He is employed both\r\nin France and Germany in hunting the boar and wolf; which savage animals\r\nhe fearlessly attacks with courage equal to any dog they possess.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREYHOUND.\r\n\r\nWe find no mention of this dog in the early Grecian records. The\r\n'pugnaces' and the 'sagaces' are mentioned; but the 'celeres'--the\r\nswift-footed--are not spoken of as a peculiar breed. The Celtic nations,\r\nthe inhabitants of the northern continent of Europe and the Western\r\nIslands, were then scarcely known, and the swift-footed dogs were\r\npeculiar to those tribes. They were not, however, introduced into the\r\nmore southern parts of Europe until after the dissolution of the Roman\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe dog is, however, mentioned by Ovid; and his description of coursing\r\nthe hare is so accurate that we cannot refrain from inserting it.  We\r\nselect a translation of it from Golding.\r\n\r\n                                          \"I gat me to the knap\r\n  Of this same hill, and there behelde of this strange course the hap,\r\n  In which the beaste seemes one while caught, and ere a man would thinke\r\n  Doth quickly give the grewnd [9] the slip, and from his biting shrinke;\r\n  And, like a wilie fox, he runs not forth directly out,\r\n  Nor makes a winlas over all the champion fields about,\r\n  But, doubling and indenting, still avoydes his enemie's lips,\r\n  An turning short, as swift about as spinning-wheele he wips,\r\n  To disappoint the snatch. The grewnd, pursuing at an inch,\r\n  Doth cote [10] him, never loosing. Continually he snatches\r\n  In vaine, but nothing in his mouth, save only hair, he catches.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another sketch by the same poet:\r\n\r\n  \"As when th' impatient greyhound, slipped from far,\r\n  Bounds o'er the glade to course the fearful hare,\r\n  She in her speed does all her safety lay,\r\n  And he with double speed pursues the prey;\r\n  O'erruns her at the sitting turn, but licks\r\n  His chaps in vain, yet blows upon the flix;\r\n  She seeks the shelter, which the neighbouring covert gives,\r\n  And, gaining it, she doubts if yet she lives.\" [11]\r\n\r\nThe English, Scotch, and Irish greyhounds were all of Celtic derivation,\r\nAnd their cultivation and character correspond with the civilization of\r\nthe different Celtic tribes. The dogs that were exported from Britain to\r\nRome were probably of this kind. Mr. Blaine gives an account of the\r\nprogress of these dogs, which seems to be evidently founded on truth.\r\n\r\n  \"Scotland, a northern locality, has long been celebrated for its\r\n  greyhounds, which are known to be large and wiry-coated. They are\r\n  probably types of the early Celtic greyhounds, which, yielding to the\r\n  influences of a colder climate than that they came from, became coated\r\n  with a thick and wiry hair. In Ireland, as being milder in its\r\n  climate, the frame expanded in bulk, and the coat, although not\r\n  altogether, was yet less crisped and wiry. In both localities, there\r\n  being at that time boars, wolves, and even bears, powerful dogs were\r\n  required. In England these wild beasts were more early exterminated,\r\n  and consequently the same kind of dog was not retained, but, on the\r\n  contrary, was by culture made finer in coat, and of greater beauty in\r\n  form.\"\r\n\r\n[The canis leporarius, or greyhound of the present day, is quite an\r\ninferior animal in point of size, when compared with his forefathers,\r\nwho alone were occupied in the chase of the boar, wolf, bear, deer, and\r\nother animals both powerful and savage.\r\n\r\nAs these wild animals gradually disappeared under the hand of\r\ncivilization, these hardy dogs were less wanted; and thus, by slow\r\ndegrees, have degenerated into the less powerful, but more beautiful and\r\nsymmetrical proportions that we now see. This change, however, has\r\nbetter adapted him for speed, and the coursing of such quadrupeds as\r\ndepend upon nimbleness and activity of motion, to secure their escape.\r\n\r\nOwing, in some measure, to the climate, but more particularly to the\r\ninactive life that they lead in this country, so much at variance with\r\nthat of England, we can lay claim to but few dogs that would be\r\nconsidered above mediocrity among British sportsmen. We have seen\r\nseveral of these dogs which, living in a state of idle luxury, have\r\ndegenerated considerably even in the third generation; and we cannot now\r\nrecall but one dog, in the possession of a young lady in Philadelphia,\r\nthat would at all come up to the English standard of perfection; and\r\nthis one is a descendant from a fine imported stock in the second\r\ngeneration. The ancient Greeks were much devoted to coursing, but\r\nprevious to the time of Arrian, their hounds were not a sufficient\r\nmatch, in point of speed, for the hare, and it was seldom that their\r\nsports were attended with success in the actual capture of this fleet\r\nanimal by the dogs alone. If taken at all, it was generally by running\r\nthem down in a long chase, or driving them into nets, toils, and other\r\nsimilar contrivances, as forcibly described in the following lines of\r\nthe ancient poet, when extolling the pleasures of a country life.\r\n\r\n  \"Aut trudit acres hinc et hinc multâ cane\r\n    Apros in obstante plagas,\r\n  Aut amite levi rara leiidit retia,\r\n    Turdis edacibus dolos;\r\n  Pavidumve leporem, et advenam laqueo gruem,\r\n    Jucunda captat præmia.\"\r\n\r\n  (Horace, 'Epode ii.', v. 31.)\r\n\r\nEven after the introduction of the Celtic hound, who, as before stated,\r\nwas far inferior as regards speed to the present race, it was no easy\r\nmatter to take the hare, it being necessary to carry several couples of\r\ndogs into the field, and let them slip at certain intervals in the\r\nchase, so that the fresh dogs might, in this way, overtake the little\r\nanimal, already frightened and fatigued by previous exertion.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this mode of coursing, the younger Xenophon particularly\r\nenjoins that to prevent confusion in the field, naturally arising from\r\nthe hunters letting their dogs loose at improper intervals, from\r\neagerness to see them run,\r\n\r\n  \"that a steward should be appointed over the sport, should match the\r\n  dogs, and give orders to the field:--if the hare start on this side,\r\n  you and you are to slip, and nobody else; but if on that side, you and\r\n  you: and let strict attention be paid to the orders given.\"\r\n  (Arrian, chap. xx.)\r\n\r\nAlciphron, in his familiar epistles descriptive of the domestic manners\r\nof the Greeks, gives a lively description of a course not very different\r\nfrom those of the present day, as will be seen in the following extract:\r\n\r\n  \"In trying whether the young dogs were fit for the chase, I started a\r\n  hare from a little bush; my sons loosed the dogs from the slips. They\r\n  frightened her confoundedly, and were very near taking the game. The\r\n  hare, in her flight, climbed a steep place, and found a retreat in\r\n  some burrow. One of the more spirited of the dogs, pressing close upon\r\n  her, gasping, and expecting to take her in his gripe, went down with\r\n  her into the hole. In endeavouring to pull out the hare, he broke one\r\n  of his fore-legs. I lifted up my good dog, with his lame leg, and\r\n  found the hare half devoured: thus, when I hoped to get something, I\r\n  encountered a serious loss.\"\r\n  (Letter ix.)\r\n\r\nWe will close our remarks upon this subject by introducing a few\r\ndescriptive lines, selected from one of the very rare English authors\r\nwho have attempted a versification of this exciting sport.\r\n\r\n  \"Yet if for silvan sport thy bosom glow,\r\n  Let thy fleet greyhound urge his flying foe.\r\n  With what delight the rapid course I view!\r\n  How does my eye the circling race pursue!\r\n  He snaps deceitful air with empty jaws;\r\n  The suttle hare darts swift beneath his paws;\r\n  She flys, he stretches, now with nimble bound\r\n  Eager he presses on, but overshoots his ground:\r\n  Then tears with goary mouth the screaming prey.\"\r\n\r\n  ('Gay's Poems', vol i.--'Rural Sports', v. 290),--L.]\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson, in his History of the Greyhound, gives a different\r\nderivation of the name of this dog. He says that the 'greyhound' was of\r\nGrecian origin--'cannis Græcus',--that 'Græcus' was not unfrequently\r\nwritten 'Græius', and thence was derived the term 'greyhound'. This\r\nderivation, however, is somewhat too far-fetched.\r\n\r\nMention occurs of the greyhound in a very early period of the British\r\nhistory. He was an inmate of the Anglo-Saxon kennels in the time of\r\nElfric, king of Mercia. There are paintings of him that can be\r\nsatisfactorily traced to the ninth century. In the time of Canute he was\r\nreckoned first in degree of rank among the canine species, and no one\r\nunder the degree of a gentleman, 'liberalis', or more properly, perhaps\r\na 'freeholder', was allowed by the forest laws to keep them. Even he\r\ncould not keep them within two miles of a royal forest, unless two of\r\nthe toes were cut off and for every mile that an uncut dog was found\r\nwithin this distance a fine of a shilling was levied on the owner. The\r\nnobleman was rarely seen abroad without his hawk upon his fist, and his\r\ngreyhound at his side.\r\n\r\nHenry II was passionately fond of them. John spared no expense to\r\nprocure good horses and swift hounds, and appears frequently to have\r\nreceived greyhounds in lieu of money on the issue or removal of grants.\r\nFor the renewal of a grant in the year 1203 he received five hundred\r\nmarks, ten horses, and ten leashes of greyhounds, and for another, in\r\n1210, one swift running horse and six greyhounds.\r\n\r\nThe Isle of Dogs, now devoted to purposes of commerce, received its name\r\nfrom its having been, at this period, the receptacle of the greyhounds\r\nand spaniels of this monarch. It was selected on account of its\r\ncontiguity to Waltham and the other royal forests where coursing was a\r\nfrequent amusement. For the same purpose he often took up his abode at\r\nGreenwich. [12]\r\n\r\nBlount's Ancient Tenures abound with instances of the high repute in\r\nwhich this dog has ever been held in Great Britain. The holders of land\r\nin the manor of Setene in Kent were compelled, as the condition of their\r\ntenure to Edward I and II, to lend their greyhounds, when this king went\r\ninto Gascony, \"so long as a pair of shoes of 4d price would last.\"\r\nEdward III was partial to greyhounds; for when he was engaged in war\r\nwith France he took with him sixty couples of them, besides other large\r\nhunting dogs.\r\n\r\nCharles I was as fond of the greyhound as his son Charles II was of the\r\nspaniel. Sir Philip Warwick thus writes of that unfortunate monarch;\r\n\r\n  \"Methinks, because it shows his dislike of a common court vice, it is\r\n  not unworthy the relating of him, that one evening, his dog scratching\r\n  at his door, he commanded me to let in Gipsy; whereupon I took, the\r\n  boldness to say, Sir, I perceive you love a greyhound better than you\r\n  do a spaniel. Yes, says he, for they equally love their masters, and\r\n  yet do not flatter them so much.\"\r\n\r\nOn most of the old tombs in the sculpture of which the dog is\r\nintroduced, the greyhound is represented lying at the feet of his\r\nmaster; and an old Welsh proverb says that a gentleman may be known by\r\nhis hawk, his horse, and his greyhound.\r\n\r\nThe following poetical record of the fidelity, prowess, and ill-fate of\r\nGêlert, the favourite greyhound of Llewellyn Prince of Wales, and\r\nson-in-law to King John, will he read with interest:\r\n\r\n  The spearman heard the bugle sound\r\n    And cheerly smiled the morn,\r\n  And many a brach and many a hound\r\n    Obeyed Llewellyn's horn.\r\n\r\n  And still as blew a lowder blast,\r\n    And gave a louder cheer,\r\n  \"Come, Gêlert! why art thou the last\r\n    Llewellyn's horn to hear?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, where does faithful Gêlert roam?\r\n    The flower of all his race!\r\n  So true, so brave; a lamb at home,\r\n    A lion in the chase?\"\r\n\r\n  'Twas only at Lewellyn's board\r\n    The faithful Gêlert fed,\r\n  He watched, he served, he cheered his lord,\r\n    And sentinel'd his bed.\r\n\r\n  In sooth he was a peerless hound,\r\n    The gift of royal John;\r\n  But now no Gêlert could be found,\r\n    And all the chase rode on.\r\n\r\n  And now as over rocks and dells\r\n    The gallant chidings rise,\r\n  All Snowdon's craggy chaos yells\r\n    With many mingled cries.\r\n\r\n  That day llewellyn little loved\r\n    The chase of hart or hare;\r\n  And scan and small the booty proved,\r\n    For Gêlert was not there.\r\n\r\n  Unpleased Llewellyn homeward hied,\r\n    When near the portal seat\r\n  His truant Gêlert he espied,\r\n    Bounding his lord to greet.\r\n\r\n  But when he gained the castle-door,\r\n    Aghast the chieftan stood;\r\n  The hound was smeared with gouts of gore--\r\n    His lips and fangs ran blood.\r\n\r\n  Llewellyn gazed with wild surprise:\r\n    Unused such looks to meet,\r\n  His favourite check'd his joyful guise\r\n    And crouched and licked his feet.\r\n\r\n  Onward in haste Llewellyn pass'd,\r\n    And on went Gélert too;\r\n  And still where'er his eyes he cast,\r\n    Fresh blood-gouts shocked his view.\r\n\r\n  O'erturned his infant's bed he found,\r\n    The blood-stained covert rent;\r\n  And all around the walls and ground,\r\n    With recent blood besprent.\r\n\r\n  He called his child--no voice replied--\r\n    He searched with terror wild:\r\n  Blood! blood! he found on every side,\r\n    But nowhere found the child.\r\n\r\n  'Hellhound! by thee my child's devoured!'\r\n    The frantic father cried;\r\n  And to the hilt his vengeful sword\r\n    He plunged in Gélert's side.\r\n\r\n  His suppliant, as to earth he fell,\r\n    No pity could impart;\r\n  But still his Gélert's dying yell\r\n    Passed heavy o'er his heart.\r\n\r\n  Aroused by Gélert's dying yell,\r\n    Some slumberer wakened nigh:\r\n  What words the parent's joy can tell\r\n    To hear his infant cry!\r\n\r\n  Concealed beneath a mangled heap\r\n    His hurried search had missed,\r\n  All glowing from his rosy sleep,\r\n    His cherub boy he kissed.\r\n\r\n  Nor scratch had he, nor harm, nor dread,\r\n    But the same couch beneath,\r\n  Lay a great wolf, all torn and dead,\r\n    Tremendous still in death.\r\n\r\n  Ah, what was then Llewellyn's pain!\r\n    For now the truth was clear:\r\n  The gallant hound the wolf had slain,\r\n    To save Llewellyn's heir.\r\n\r\n  Vain, vain was all Llewellyn's wo:\r\n    \"Best of thy kind, adieu!\r\n  The frantic deed which laid thee low,\r\n    This heart shall ever rue.\"\r\n\r\n  And now a gallant tomb they raise,\r\n    With costly sculpture decked;\r\n  And marbles, storied with his praise,\r\n    Poor Gélert's bones protect.\r\n\r\n  Here never could the spearman pass,\r\n  Or forester, unmoved;\r\n  Here oft the tear-besprinkled grass\r\n  Llewellyn's sorrow proved.\r\n\r\n  And here he hung his horn and spear;\r\n  And oft, as evening fell,\r\n  In fancy's piercing sounds would hear\r\n  Poor Gêlert's dying yell!\r\n\r\nIt will be evident, however, from the story of the noble hound whose\r\nhistory is just related, that the greyhounds of the time were very\r\ndifferent from those which are used at the present day. There are no\r\nGêlerts now to combat successfully with the wolf, if these ferocious\r\nanimals were yet to be met with in our forests. The greyhound of this\r\nearly period must have resembled the Irish wolf-dog of the present day,\r\na larger, stronger, fiercer dog than we are accustomed to see.\r\n\r\nThe owner of Gêlert lived in the time of John, in the early part of the\r\nthirteenth century; but, at the latter part of the fifteenth century,\r\nthe following singular description is given of the greyhound of that\r\nperiod. It is extracted from a very curious work entitled \"The Treatise\r\nperteynynge to Hawkynge, Huntynge, &c., emprynted at Westmestre, by\r\nWynkyn de Werde, 1496.\"\r\n\r\n  A greyhounde should be headed lyke a snake,\r\n  And neckyd lyke a drake,\r\n  Fotyd lyke a cat\r\n  Tayled lyke a ratte,\r\n  Syded like a teme\r\n  And chyned like a bream.\r\n  The fyrste yere he must lerne to fede,\r\n  The seconde yere to feld him lede.\r\n  The thyrde yere he is felow lyke.\r\n  The fourth yere there is non syke.\r\n  The fifth yere he is good ynough.\r\n  The syxth yere he shall hold the plough,\r\n  The seventh yere he will avaylle\r\n  Grete bytches for assayle.\r\n  But when he is come to the ninth yere\r\n  Have him then to the tannere;\r\n  For the best hounde that ever bytch had\r\n  At the ninth yere is full bad.\r\n\r\nAs to the destiny of the poor animal in his ninth year, we differ from\r\nthe author; but it cannot be denied that few dogs retain their speed\r\nbeyond the eighth or ninth year.\r\n\r\nThere can scarcely be a better description of the greyhound of the\r\npresent day; but it would not do for the antagonist of the wolf. The\r\nbreed had probably begun to degenerate, and that process would seem to\r\nhave slowly progressed. Towards the close of the last century, Lord\r\nOrford, a nobleman enthusiastically devoted to coursing, imagined, and\r\nrightly, that the greyhound of his day was deficient in courage and\r\nperseverance. He bethought himself how this could best be rectified, and\r\nhe adopted a plan which brought upon him much ridicule at the time, but\r\nultimately redounded to his credit. He selected a bull-dog, one of the\r\nsmooth rat-tailed species, and he crossed one of his greyhound bitches\r\nwith him. He kept the female whelps and crossed them with some of his\r\nfleetest dogs, and the consequence was, that, after the sixth or seventh\r\ngeneration, there was not a vestige left of the form of the bulldog; but\r\nhis courage and his indomitable perseverance remained, and, having once\r\nstarted after his game, he did not relinquish chase until he fell\r\nexhausted or perhaps died. This cross is now almost universally adopted.\r\nIt is one of the secrets in the breeding of the greyhound.\r\n\r\nOf the stanchness of the well-bred greyhound, the following is a\r\nsatisfactory example.  A hare was started before a brace of greyhounds,\r\nand ran by them for several miles. When they were found, both the dogs\r\nand the hare lay dead within a few yards of each other. A labouring man\r\nhad seen them turn her several times; but it did not appear that either\r\nof them had caught her, for there was no wound upon her.\r\n\r\nA favourite bitch of this breed was Czarina, bred by Lord Orford, and\r\npurchased at his decease by Colonel Thornton: she won every match for\r\nwhich she started, and they were no fewer than forty-seven. Lord Orford\r\nhad matched her for a stake of considerable magnitude; but, before the\r\nappointed day arrived, he became seriously ill and was confined to his\r\nchamber. On the morning of the course he eluded the watchfulness of his\r\nattendant, saddled his favourite piebald pony, and, at the moment of\r\nstarting, appeared on the course. No one had power to restrain him, and\r\nall entreaties were in vain. He peremptorily insisted on the dogs being\r\nstarted, and he would ride after them. His favourite bitch displayed her\r\nsuperiority at every stroke; she won the stakes: but at the moment of\r\nhighest exultation he fell from his pony, and, pitching on his head,\r\nalmost immediately expired. With all his eccentricities, he was a kind,\r\nbenevolent, and honourable man.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth year of her age, and in defiance of the strange verses\r\njust now quoted, Czarina began to breed, and two of her progeny, Claret\r\nand young Czarina, challenged the whole kingdom and won their matches.\r\nMajor, and Snowball, without a white spot about him, inherited all the\r\nexcellence of their dam. The former was rather the fleeter of the two,\r\nbut the stanchness of Snowball nothing could exceed. A Scotch greyhound,\r\nwho had beaten every opponent in his own country, was at this time\r\nbrought to England, and challenged every dog in the kingdom. The\r\nchallenge was accepted by Snowball, who beat him in a two-mile course.\r\nSnowball won the Mailton cup on four successive years, was never beaten,\r\nand some of his blood is now to be traced in almost every good dog in\r\nevery part of the kingdom, at least in all those that are accustomed to\r\nhunt in an open country. The last match run by Snowball was against Mr.\r\nPlumber's celebrated greyhound Speed; and, so severely contested was it,\r\nthat Speed died soon afterwards. A son of the old dog, called Young\r\nSnowball, who almost equalled his father, was sold for one hundred\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the greyhound has been said to be equal to that of the\r\nfleetest horse. A singular circumstance, which occurred at Doncaster,\r\nproved that it was not much inferior. A mare cantering over the\r\nDoncaster course, her competitor having been withdrawn, was joined by a\r\ngreyhound bitch when she had proceeded about a mile. She seemed\r\ndetermined to race with the mare, which the jockey humoured, and\r\ngradually increased his pace, until at the distance they put themselves\r\nat their full speed. The mare beat her antagonist only by a head. The\r\nrace-horse is, perhaps, generally superior to the greyhound on level\r\nground, but the greyhound would have the advantage in a hilly country.\r\n\r\nLord Rivers succeeded to Major Topham and Colonel Thornton, the owners\r\nof Major and Snowball, as the leading man on the course. His kennels at\r\nStrathfieldsaye were the pride of the neighbouring country. At first he\r\nbore away almost every prize, but breeding too much in and in, and for\r\nspeed more than for stoutness, the reputation of his kennel considerably\r\ndeclined before his death.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 a brace of greyhounds coursed a hare over the edge of a\r\nchalk-pit at Offham, in Sussex. The hare and both the dogs were found\r\ndead at the bottom of the pit.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a hare was chased by a brace of greyhounds: she was\r\nkilled at the distance of seven miles from the place at which they\r\nstarted. Both of the dogs were so exhausted, that every possible\r\nassistance being given, they were with difficulty recovered.\r\n\r\nThe English greyhound hunts by sight alone; not because he is altogether\r\ndevoid of scent, but because he has been taught to depend upon his\r\nspeed, and that degree of speed which is utterly incompatible with the\r\nsearching out of the scent. It is like a pack of hounds, running breast\r\nhigh, with the game in view. They are then running by sight, and not by\r\nscent, almost doubling their usual pace, and sometimes, from an\r\nunexpected turning of the fox or hare, thrown out for a little while.\r\nThe hound soon recovers the track by his exquisite sense of smell. The\r\nEnglish greyhound is never taught to scent his game, but, on the\r\ncontrary, is called off the moment he has lost sight of the hare, the\r\nre-starting of which is left to the spaniel.\r\n\r\nThe English greyhound is distinguished by its peculiarly long and\r\nattenuated head and face, terminating in a singular sharpness of the\r\nnose, and length of the muzzle or month. There are two results from\r\nthis: the length of the mouth gives a longer grasp and secures the prey,\r\nbut, as the nasal cavities and the cavity of the skull are\r\nproportionately diminished, there is not so much room for the expansion\r\nof the membrane of the nose, there is less power of scent, and less\r\nspace for the development of the brain.\r\n\r\nThere is little want of extraordinary acute hearing, and the ears of the\r\ngreyhound are small compared with his bulk. Markham recommends the ears\r\nto be close, sharp, and drooping, neither protruding by their bulk, nor\r\ntiring by their weight.\r\n\r\nThe power of the eye is but of little consequence, for the game is\r\nrarely distant from the dog, and therefore, easily seen.\r\n\r\nThe neck is an important portion of the frame. It should be long, in\r\norder to correspond with the length of the legs, and thus enable the dog\r\nto seize and lift the game, as he rapidly pursues his course, without\r\nthrowing any undue or dangerous weight on the fore extremities. In the\r\nact of seizing the hare the short-necked dog may lose the centre of\r\ngravity and fall.\r\n\r\nThe chest is a very important part of the greyhound, as well as of every\r\nother animal of speed. It must be capacious: this capacity must be\r\nobtained by depth rather than by width, in order that the shoulders may\r\nnot be thrown so far apart as to impede progression.\r\n\r\nThe form and situation of the shoulders are of material consequence; for\r\non them depends the extent of the action which the animal is capable of\r\nexerting. The shoulders should be broad and deep, and obliquely placed.\r\nThey are so in the horse, and the action of the dog depends entirely on\r\nthis conformation.\r\n\r\nThe fore legs should be set on square at the shoulder: bulging out at\r\nthe elbow not only gives a clumsy appearance, but makes the dog slow.\r\nThe legs should have plenty of bone, and be straight, and well set on\r\nthe feet, and the toes neither turned out nor in. The fore arm, or that\r\nportion of the leg which is between the elbow and the knee, should be\r\nlong, straight and muscular. These are circumstances that cannot be\r\ndispensed with. The length of the fore arm, and the low placing of the\r\npastern, are of essential importance.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the form of the back and sides of the greyhound, Mr.\r\nThacker says, with much truth, that\r\n\r\n  \"It is the strength of the back which is brought into requisition, in\r\n  particular, in running over hilly ground. Here may be said to rest the\r\n  distinction between long and short backs, supposing both to be good\r\n  and strong. The more lengthy the back, and proportionately strong, the\r\n  more the greyhound is calculated to beat the shorter-backed dog on the\r\n  flat; but on hilly ground one with a shorter back will have the\r\n  advantage.\" [13]\r\n\r\nThe ribs should also be well arched. We would perhaps avoid him with\r\nsides too decidedly outswelling, but still more would we avoid the\r\ndirect flat-sided dog.\r\n\r\nWithout really good haunches and muscular thighs, it has been well\r\nremarked that the odds are against any dog, be his other points whatever\r\nthey may. It is by the propulsatory efforts of the muscles of the loins\r\nand thighs that the race is won. The thighs should be large, and\r\nmuscularly indented; the hocks broad, and, like the knee, low placed.\r\nThese are very important points; for, as Mr. Blaine has properly\r\nremarked, \"on the extent of the angles formed between these several\r\nportions of the hinder limbs, depends the extent of the space passed\r\nover at each bound.\"\r\n\r\nThe colour of the greyhound varies exceedingly. Some are perfectly black\r\nand glossy. In strength and endurance, the brindled dog, or the brown or\r\nfawn-coloured one, is the best. The white greyhound, although a\r\nbeautiful animal and swift, is not, perhaps, quite so much to be\r\ndepended on.\r\n\r\nThe greyhound is said to be deficient in attachment to his master and in\r\ngeneral intelligence. There is some truth in the imputation; but, in\r\nfact, the greyhound has, far less than even the hound, the opportunity\r\nof forming individual attachments, and no other exercise of the mind is\r\nrequired of him than to follow the game which starts up before him, and\r\nto catch it if he can. If, however, he is closely watched he will be\r\nfound to have all the intellect that his situation requires. [14]\r\n\r\nAs to the individual attachment which the greyhound may form, he has not\r\nalways or often the opportunity to acquire or to exhibit it. The keeper\r\nexercises over him a tyrannical power, and the owner seldom notices him\r\nin the manner which excites affection, or scarcely recognition; but, as\r\na plea for the seeming want of fondness, which, compared with other\r\nbreeds, he exhibits, it will be sufficient to quote the testimony of the\r\nyounger Xenophon, who had made the greyhound his companion and his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n  \"I have myself bred up,\" says he, \"a swift, hard-working, courageous,\r\n  sound-footed dog. He is most gentle and kindly affectioned, and never\r\n  before had I any such a dog for myself, or my friend, or my\r\n  fellow-sportsman. When he is not actually engaged in coursing, he is\r\n  never away from me. On his return he runs before me, often looking\r\n  back to see whether I had turned out of the road, and as soon as he\r\n  again catches sight of me, showing symptoms of joy, and once more\r\n  trotting away before me. If a short time only has passed since he has\r\n  seen me or my friend, he jumps up repeatedly by way of salutation, and\r\n  barks with joy as a greeting to us. He has also many different tones\r\n  of speech, and such as I never heard from any other dog. Now really I\r\n  do not think that I ought to be ashamed to chronicle the name of this\r\n  dog, or to let posterity know that Xenophon the Athenian had a\r\n  greyhound, called Hormé, possessed of the greatest speed, and\r\n  intelligence, and fidelity, and excellent in every point.\"\r\n\r\n[The Greek sportsmen held their dogs in peculiar estimation; they were\r\nnot only their attendants in the field, but their constant companions in\r\ntheir houses, were fed from their tables, and even shared their beds. It\r\nis with some degree of pleasure that the patrons of this noble animal\r\nwill witness, in the following remarks, the tender solicitude with which\r\nthis people watched over their dogs.\r\n\r\n  \"There is nothing like a soft and warm bed for greyhounds, but it is\r\n  best for them to sleep with men, as they become thereby affectionately\r\n  attached, pleased with the contact of the human body, and as fond of\r\n  their bed-fellow as of their feeder. If any ailing affect the dog the\r\n  man will perceive it, and will relieve him in the night, when thirsty,\r\n  or urged by any call of nature. He will also know how the dog has\r\n  rested. For if he has passed a sleepless night, or groaned frequently\r\n  in his sleep, or thrown up any of his food, it will not be safe to\r\n  take him out coursing. All these things the dog's bed-fellow will be\r\n  acquainted with.\"\r\n  (Arrian, chap. ix. Trans.)\r\n\r\nIt was also not an unusual circumstance for the most polished Greeks,\r\nwhen sending notes of invitation to their friends, requesting their\r\npresence in celebration of some festive occasion, to extend the same\r\ncivilities to their favourite dogs, by desiring them to be brought\r\nalong, as will be seen by the following paragraph selected from a letter\r\nof this kind addressed by one friend to another.\r\n\r\n  \"I am about to celebrate the birth-day of my son, and I invite you, my\r\n  Pithacion, to the feast. But come not alone; bring with you your wife,\r\n  children, and your brother. If you will bring also your bitch, who is\r\n  a good guard, and by the loudness of her voice drives away the enemies\r\n  of your flocks, she will not, I warrant, disdain to be partaker of our\r\n  feast, &c.\"\r\n  (Letter xviii., Alciphron's Epistles.)--L.]\r\n\r\nThe greyhound has within the last fifty years assumed a somewhat\r\ndifferent character from that which he once possessed. He is\r\ndistinguished by a beautiful symmetry of form, of which he once could\r\nnot boast, and he has even superior speed to that which he formerly\r\nexhibited. He is no longer used to struggle with the deer, but he\r\ncontends with his fellow over a shorter and speedier course.\r\n\r\nThe rules for breeding and breaking-in of greyhounds are very simple.\r\nThe utmost attention should be paid to the qualities of the parents; for\r\nit is as certain in these dogs as in the horse that all depends upon the\r\nbreeding. The bitch should be healthy and of good size; the dog\r\nmuscular, stanch, and speedy, and somewhat larger than the bitch. Both\r\nshould have arrived at their full vigour, and with none of their powers\r\nbeginning to fail. Those as much as possible should be selected whose\r\npeculiar appearance bids fair to increase the good qualities and\r\ndiminish the bad ones on either side. The best blood and the best form\r\nshould be diligently sought. Breeding from young dogs on either side\r\nshould, generally speaking, be avoided. With regard to older dogs,\r\nwhether male or female, there may be less care. Many greyhounds, both\r\nmale and female, eight, nine, and ten years of age, have been the\r\nprogenitors of dogs possessing every stanch and good quality.\r\n\r\nOn no consideration, however, should the bitch be put to the dog before\r\nshe is two years old. Little can be done to regulate the period of\r\noestrum; but the most valuable breed will be almost invariably that\r\nwhich is produced during the spring, because at that time there will\r\noften be opportunity for that systematic exercise on which the growth\r\nand powers of the dog so materially depend. A litter of puppies in the\r\nbeginning or even the middle of winter will often be scarcely worth the\r\ntrouble or expense of rearing.\r\n\r\nThe age of the greyhound is now taken from the first day in the year;\r\nbut the conditions of entry are fixed at different periods. It seems,\r\nhowever, to be agreed that no dog or bitch can qualify for a puppy cup\r\nafter two years of ago.\r\n\r\nOne principle to be ever kept in mind is a warm and comfortable\r\nsituation, and a plentiful supply of nourishment for the mother and for\r\nthe puppies from the moment of their birth. The dog that is stinted in\r\nhis early growth will never do its owner credit. The bitch should be\r\nabundantly supplied with milk, and the young ones with milk and bread,\r\nand oatmeal, and small portions of flesh as soon as they are disposed to\r\neat it; great care, however, being taken that they are not over-gorged.\r\nRegular and proper feeding, with occasional exercise, will constitute\r\nthe best preparation for the actual training. If a foster-mother be\r\nrequired for the puppies, it should, if possible, be a greyhound; for it\r\nis not at all impossible that the bad qualities of the nurse may to a\r\ngreater or less degree be communicated to the whelps. Bringing up by\r\nhand is far preferable to the introduction of any foster-mother. A glass\r\nor Indian-rubber bottle may be used for a little while, if not until the\r\nweaning. Milk at first, and afterwards milk and sop alternately, may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference of opinion whether the whelp should be kept in the\r\nkennel and subjected to its regular discipline, or placed at walk in\r\nsome farm-house. In consequence of the liberty he will enjoy at the\r\nlatter, his growth will probably be more rapid; but, running with the\r\nfarmers' dogs, and probably coursing many hares, he will acquire, to a\r\ncertain degree, a habit of wildness. It is useless to deny this; but, on\r\nthe other hand, nothing will contribute so much to the development of\r\nevery power as a state of almost unlimited freedom when the dogs are\r\nyoung. The wildness that will be exhibited can soon be afterwards\r\nrestrained so far as is necessary, and the dog who has been permitted to\r\nexert his powers when young will manifest his superiority in more\r\nadvanced age, and in nothing more than his dexterity at the turn.\r\n\r\nWhen the training actually commences, it should be preceded by a couple\r\nof doses of physic, with an interval of five or six days, and, probably,\r\na moderate bleeding between them; for, if the dog begins to work\r\noverloaded with flesh and fat, he will suffer so severely from it that\r\npossibly he will never afterwards prove a game dog. In the course of his\r\ntraining he should be allowed every advantage and experience every\r\nencouragement. His courses should be twice or thrice a-week, according\r\nto their severity, and as often as it can be effected be should be\r\nrewarded with some mark of kindness.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Sportsman' for April, 1840, is an interesting account of the\r\nchase of the hare. It is said that, in general, a good greyhound will\r\nreach a hare if she runs straight. He pursues her eagerly, and the\r\nmoment he is about to strike at her she turns short, and the dog, unable\r\nto stop himself, is thrown from ten to twenty yards from her. These\r\njerking turns soon begin to tell upon a dog, and an old well-practised\r\nhare will seldom fail to make her escape. When, however, pursued by a\r\ncouple of dogs, the hare has a more difficult game to play, as it\r\nfrequently happens that when she is turned by the leading dog she has\r\ngreat difficulty in avoiding the stroke of the second.\r\n\r\nIt is highly interesting to witness the game of an old hare. She has\r\ngenerally some brake or thicket in view, under the cover of which she\r\nmeans to escape from her pursuers. On moving from her seat she makes\r\ndirectly for the hiding-place, but, unable to reach it, has recourse to\r\nturning, and, 'wrenched' by one or the other of her pursuers, she seems\r\nevery moment almost in the jaws of one of them, and yet in a most\r\ndexterous manner she accomplishes her object. A greyhound, when he\r\nperceives a hare about to enter a thicket, is sure to strike at her if\r\nwithin any reasonable distance. The hare shortens her stride as she\r\napproaches the thicket, and at the critical moment she makes so sudden,\r\ndexterous, and effectual a spring, that the dogs are flung to a\r\nconsiderable distance, and she has reached the cover and escaped.\r\n\r\nThe isle of Cyprus has for many years been celebrated for its breed of\r\nthe greyhound. On grand days, or when the governor is present, the sport\r\nis conducted in a curious manner. When the hare is ready to become the\r\nprey of its enemies, the governor rushes forwards, and, throwing before\r\nthe greyhounds a stick which he carries, they all instantaneously stop.\r\nThe hare now runs a little distance; but one of the swiftest greyhounds\r\nis then let loose. He pursues the hare, and, having come up with it,\r\ncarries it back, and, springing on the neck of the governor's horse,\r\nplaces it before him. The governor delivers it to one of his officers,\r\nwho sends it to the park, where he maintains many prisoners of the same\r\nkind; for he will not destroy the animal that has contributed to his\r\namusement. [15]\r\n\r\nThe following, according to Mr. Blaine, an ardent courser in his youth,\r\nis the best mode of feeding greyhounds at regular work:\r\n\r\n  \"The dogs had a full flesh meal every afternoon or evening, as more\r\n  nutriment is derived from night-feeding than by day, and when sleeping\r\n  than when waking. In the morning they were let out, and either\r\n  followed the keeper about the paddock, or the groom in his horse\r\n  exercise, and then had a trifling meat of mixed food, as a quieting\r\n  portion, until the evening full meal. Such was our practice on the\r\n  days when no coursing was contemplated, and, with the exception of\r\n  lowering the quantity and quality of the evening meal, the same plan\r\n  was pursued throughout the year. On the day previous to coursing, if\r\n  we intended anything like an exhibition of our dogs before company\r\n  engaged to meet us on the marshes, we gave a plentiful meal early the\r\n  previous day, some exercise also in the afternoon, and a light supper\r\n  at night, of meal with either broth or milk, with a man on horseback\r\n  going a gentle trot of six or seven miles an hour.\" [16]\r\n\r\nMr. Thacker orders the greyhounds out on the fore part of every day;\r\nbut, instead of being loose and at liberty, they would be much better\r\ntwo and two; then, when he meets with a proper field to loose them in,\r\nto give them a good gallop. This will be a greater novelty than if they\r\nhad been loose on the road, and they will gallop with more eagerness.\r\nFour days in a week will be enough for this exercise. On one day there\r\nshould he a gallop of one or two miles, or even a course for each brace\r\nof dogs.\r\n\r\nThe young dog has usually an older and more experienced one to start\r\nwith him. That which is of most importance is, that his leader should be\r\na thoroughly stout and high-mettled dog. If he shrinks or shies at any\r\nimpediment, however formidable, the young one will be sure to imitate\r\nhim, and to become an uncertain dog, if not a rank coward. Early in\r\nNovember is the time when these initiatory trials are to be made. It is\r\nof consequence that the young one should witness a death as soon as\r\npossible. Some imagine that two old dogs should accompany the young one\r\nat its first commencement. After the death of the leveret, the young dog\r\nmust be coaxed and fondled, but never suffered to taste the blood.\r\n\r\nIn kennels in which the training is regularly conducted, the dog should\r\nbe brushed all over twice every day. Few things contribute so much to\r\nhealth as general cleanliness, and friction applied to the skin. Warmth\r\nis as necessary for greyhounds as for horses, and should not be\r\nforgotten in cold weather. Body-clothing is a custom of considerable\r\nantiquity, and should not be abandoned. The breeder of greyhounds for\r\nthe purpose of coursing must reckon upon incurring considerable expense;\r\nbut, if he loves the sport, ho will be amply remunerated by the speed\r\nand stoutness of his dogs.\r\n\r\nA question has arisen whether, on the morning of the coursing, any\r\nstimulant should be given to the dog. The author of this work would\r\nunhesitatingly approve of this practice. He has had abundant experience\r\nof the good effect of it; but the stimulus must be that which, while it\r\nproduces the desired effect, leaves no exhaustion behind. [17]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTCH GREYHOUND\r\n\r\nhas the same sharpness of muzzle, length of head, lightness of ear, and\r\ndepth of chest, as the English dog; but the general frame is stronger\r\nand more muscular, the hind quarters more prominent, there is evident\r\nincrease of size and roughness of coat, and there is also some\r\ndiminution of speed. If it were not for these points, these dogs might\r\noccasionally be taken for each other. In coursing the hare, no\r\nnorth-country dog will stand against the lighter southern, although the\r\nsouthern would be unequal to the labour often required from the\r\nHighlander.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch greyhound is said--perhaps wrongly--to be oftenest used by\r\nthose who look more to the quantity of game than to the fairness and\r\nopenness of the sport, and in some parts of the country this dog is not\r\npermitted to be entered for a sweepstakes, because, instead of depending\r\non his speed alone, as does the English greyhound, he has recourse to\r\noccasional artifices in order to intercept the hare. In sporting\r\nlanguage he runs sly, and, therefore, is sometimes excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIGHLAND GREYHOUND, OR DEER-HOUND\r\n\r\nis a larger, stronger, and fiercer dog, and may be readily distinguished\r\nfrom the Lowland Scotch greyhound by its pendulous, and, generally,\r\ndarker ears, and by the length of hair which almost covers his face.\r\nMany accounts have been given of the perfection of its scent, and it is\r\nsaid to have followed a wounded deer during two successive days. He is\r\nusually two inches taller than the Scotch greyhound. The head is carried\r\nparticularly high, and gives to the animal a noble appearance. His limbs\r\nare exceedingly muscular, his back beautifully arched. The tail is long\r\nand curved, but assumes the form of an almost straight line when he is\r\nmuch excited. The only fault which these dogs have is their occasional\r\nill-temper, or even ferocity; but this does not extend to the owner and\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\nIt appears singular that the English greyhound exhibits so little power\r\nof scent; but this is simply because he has never been taught to use it,\r\nor has been cruelly corrected when he has attempted to exercise it.\r\n\r\nHolinshed relates the mischief that followed the stealing of one of\r\nthese dogs:\r\n\r\n  \"Divers of the young Pictesh nobilitye repaired unto Craithlint, King\r\n  of the Scots, for to hunt and make merie with him; but, when they\r\n  should depart homewards, perceiving that the Scotish dogs did far\r\n  excel theirs, both in fairnesse, swiftnesse, and hardinesse, and also\r\n  in long standing up and holding out, they got diverse both dogs and\r\n  bitches of the best kind for breed, to be given them by the Scotish\r\n  Lords: and yet not so contented, they stole one belonging to the King\r\n  from his keeper, being more esteemed of him than all the others which\r\n  he had about him. The maister of the leash, being informed hereof\r\n  pursued after them that had stolen the dog, thinking, indeed, to have\r\n  taken him from them: but they not being to part with him fell at\r\n  altercation, and at the end chanced to strike the maister of the leash\r\n  through with their horse spears, so that he did die presently.\r\n  Whereupon noise and crie being raised in the country by his servantes,\r\n  divers of the Scots, as they were going home from hunting, returned,\r\n  and falling upon the Picts to revenge the death of their fellow, there\r\n  ensued a shrewed bickering betwixt them; so that of the Scots there\r\n  died three score gentlemen, besides a great number of the commons, not\r\n  one of them understanding what the matter meant. Of the Picts there\r\n  were about 100 slaine.\"\r\n\r\nMr. H.D. Richardson describes a cross between the greyhound and British\r\nbloodhound:\r\n\r\n  \"It is a tall muscular raw-boned dog, the ears far larger, and more\r\n  pendulous, than those of the greyhound or deer-hound. The colour is\r\n  generally black, or black and tan; his muzzle and the tips of the ears\r\n  usually dark. He is exceedingly swift and fierce; can pull down a stag\r\n  single-handed; runs chiefly by sight, but will also occasionally take\r\n  up the scent. In point of scent, however, he is inferior to the true\r\n  deer-hound.  This dog cannot take a turn readily, but often fails at\r\n  the double.\" [18]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH GREYHOUND.\r\n\r\nThis dog differs from the Scotch, in having shorter and finer hair, of a\r\npale fawn colour, and pendent ears. It is, compared with the Scotch dog,\r\ngentle and harmless, perhaps indolent, until roused. It is a larger dog\r\nthan the Scottish dog, some of them being full four feet in length, and\r\nproportionately muscular. On this account, and also on account of their\r\ndetermined spirit when roused, they were carefully preserved by some\r\nIrish gentlemen. They were formerly used in hunting the wolf when that\r\nanimal infested the forests of Ireland. Mr. Bell says that the last\r\nperson who kept the pure breed was Lord Altamont, who in 1780 \"had eight\r\nof them.\" [19]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GASEHOUND,\r\n\r\nthe 'agasaeus' of former times, was probably allied to, or connected\r\nwith, the Irish greyhound. It hunted entirely by sight, and, if its prey\r\nwas lost for a time, it could recover it by a singular distinguishing\r\nfaculty. Should the deer rejoin the herd, the dog would unerringly\r\nselect him again from all his companions:\r\n\r\n  \"Seest thou the gasehound how with glance severe\r\n  From the close herd he marks the destined deer?\" [20]\r\n\r\nThere is no dog possessed of this quality at present known in Europe;\r\nbut the translator of Arrian thinks that it might be produced between\r\nthe Irish greyhound and the bloodhound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH WOLF-DOG\r\n\r\nThis animal is nearly extinct, or only to be met with at the mansions of\r\none or two persons by whom he is kept more for show than use, the wild\r\nanimals which he seemed powerful enough to conquer having long\r\ndisappeared from the kingdom. The beauty of his appearance and the\r\nantiquity of his race are his only claims, as he disdains the chase of\r\nstag, fox, or hare, although he is ever ready to protect the person and\r\nthe property of his master. His size is various, some having attained\r\nthe height of four feet, and Dr. Goldsmith stales that he saw one as\r\nlarge as a yearling calf. He is shaped like a greyhound, but stouter;\r\nand the only dog which the writer from whom this account is taken ever\r\nsaw approaching to his graceful figure, combining beauty with strength,\r\nis the large Spanish wolf-dog: concerning which he adds, that, showing\r\none of these Spanish dogs to some friends, he leaped through a window\r\ninto a cow-house, where a valuable calf was lying, and seizing the\r\nterrified animal, killed it in an instant; some sheep having in the same\r\nway disappeared, he was given away. The same writer says that his\r\ngrandfather had an Irish wolf-dog which saved his mother's life from a\r\nwolf as she was paying a visit attended by this faithful follower. He\r\nrushed on his foe just when he was about to make his spring, and after a\r\nfierce struggle laid him dead at his mistress's feet. His name was Bran.\r\n[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN GREYHOUND\r\n\r\nis principally distinguished by its dark-brown or iron-grey colour--its\r\nshort semi-erect ears--its thin lanky body--long but muscular legs--soft\r\nthick hair, and the hair of its tail forming a spiral twist, or fan,\r\n(thence called the fan-tailed dog,) and as he runs having a very\r\npleasing appearance. He hunts by scent as well as by sight, and,\r\ntherefore, small packs of this kind are sometimes kept, against which\r\nthe wolf, or even the bear, would stand little chance. He is principally\r\nused for the chase of the deer or the wolf, but occasionally follows the\r\nhare. The deer is the principal object of pursuit, and for this he is\r\nfar better adapted than to contend with the ferocious wolf. His\r\nprincipal faults are want of activity and dexterity. He is met with in\r\nmost parts of Russia, where his breed is carefully preserved by the\r\nnobility, with whom coursing is a favourite diversion.\r\n\r\nSome dogs of this breed were not long ago introduced into Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRECIAN GREYHOUND\r\n\r\nThe author is glad that he is enabled to present his readers with the\r\nportrait of one now in the menagerie of the Zoological Society of\r\nLondon. It is the dog whose image is occasionally sculptured on the\r\nfriezes of some of the ancient Grecian temples, and was doubtless a\r\nfaithful portrait of one of the dogs which Xenophon the Athenian valued,\r\nand was the companion of the heroes of Greece in her ancient glory.\r\n\r\nThe principal difference between the Grecian and the English greyhound\r\nis, that the former is not so large, the muzzle is not so pointed, and\r\nthe limbs are not so finely framed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKISH GREYHOUND\r\n\r\nis a small-sized hairless dog, or with only a few hairs on his tail. He\r\nis never used in the field, and bred only as a spoiled pet, yet not\r\nalways spoiled, for anecdotes are related of his inviolable attachment\r\nto his owner. One of them belonged to a Turkish Pacha who was destroyed\r\nby the bowstring. He would not forsake the corpse, but laid himself down\r\nby the body of his murdered master, and presently expired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSIAN GREYHOUND\r\n\r\nis a beautiful animal. He is more delicately framed than the English\r\nbreed; the ears are also more pendulous, and feathered almost as much as\r\nthose of a King Charles's spaniel. Notwithstanding, however, his\r\napparent slenderness and delicacy, he yields not in courage, and\r\nscarcely in strength, to the British dog. There are few kennels in which\r\nhe is found in which he is not the master.\r\n\r\nIn his native country, he is not only used for hunting the hare, but the\r\nantelope, the wild ass, and even the boar. The antelope is speedier than\r\nthe greyhound: therefore the hawk is given to him as an ally. The\r\nantelope is no sooner started than the hawk is cast off, who, fluttering\r\nbefore the head of the deer, and sometimes darting his talons into his\r\nhead, disconcerts him, and enables the greyhound speedily to overtake\r\nand master him. The chase, however, in which the Persians chiefly\r\ndelight, and for which these greyhounds are mostly valued, is that of\r\nthe 'ghoo-khan', or wild ass. This animal inhabits the mountainous\r\ndistricts of Persia. He is swift, ferocious, and of great endurance,\r\nwhich, together with the nature of the ground, renders this sport\r\nexceedingly dangerous. The hunter scarcely gives the animal a fair\r\nchance, for relays of greyhounds are placed at various distances in the\r\nsurrounding country; so that, when those by which the animal is first\r\nstarted are tired, there are others to continue the chase. Such,\r\nhowever, is the speed and endurance of the ghoo-khan, that it is seldom\r\nfairly run down by the greyhounds, its death being usually achieved by\r\nthe rifle of some horseman. The Persians evince great skill and courage\r\nin this dangerous sport, galloping at full speed, rifle in hand, up and\r\ndown the most precipitous hills, and across ravines and mountain\r\nstreams, that might well daunt the boldest rider. [22]\r\n\r\nThe Persian greyhound, carried to Hindoostan, is not always to be\r\ndepended upon; but, it is said, is apt to console itself by hunting its\r\nown master, or any one else, when the game proves too fleet or escapes\r\ninto the cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN GREYHOUND\r\n\r\npossesses all the symmetry of the English or Persian one, on a small\r\nscale. So far as beauty can recommend it, and, generally speaking, good\r\nnature, it is deservedly a favourite in the drawingroom; but, like the\r\nlarge greyhound, it is inferior in intelligence. It has no strong\r\nindividual attachment, but changes it with singular facility. It is not,\r\nhowever, seen to advantage in its petted and degraded state, but has\r\noccasionally proved a not unsuccessful courser of the rabbit and the\r\nhare, and exhibited no small share of speed and perseverance. In a\r\ncountry, however, the greater part of which is infested with wolves, it\r\ncannot be of much service, but exposed to unnecessary danger. It is bred\r\nalong the coasts of Italy, principally for the purpose of sale to\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nIn order to acquire more perfect beauty of form, and more activity also,\r\nthe English greyhound has received one cross from the Italian, and with\r\ndecided advantage. The speed and the beauty have been evidently\r\nincreased, and the courage and stoutness have not been diminished.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Frederick the Great of Prussia was very fond of a\r\nsmall Italian greyhound, and used to carry it about with him under his\r\ncloak. During the seven years' war, he was pursued by a party of\r\nAustrian dragoons, and compelled to take shelter, with his favourite,\r\nunder the dry arch of a bridge. Had the little animal, that was\r\nnaturally ill-tempered and noisy, once barked, the monarch would have\r\nbeen taken prisoner, and the fate of the campaign and of Prussia\r\ndecided; but it lay perfectly still, and clung close to its master, as\r\nif conscious of their mutual danger. When it died, it was buried in the\r\ngardens of the palace at Berlin, and a suitable inscription placed over\r\nits grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'Annals of Sporting', vol. vi. p. 99.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The superstition of the Arabians and Turks with regard to\r\ndogs is somewhat singular: neither have they much affection for these\r\nanimals, or suffer them to be in or near the camp, except to guard it in\r\nthe night.  They have, however, some charity for the females that have\r\nwhelps.  As for other dogs, they feed them well, and give them good\r\nwords, but never touch them nor go near them, because dogs are regarded\r\nas unclean animals. They particularly drive them away in wet weather;\r\nfor, if one drop of water from a dog should fall on their raiment, their\r\ndevotion would be interrupted and useless.  They who are fond of hunting\r\nmake their religion subservient to their pleasure, and say that\r\ngreyhounds and setters are excepted from the general rule, because when\r\nnot running these dogs are tied up where nothing unclean can reach them,\r\nand they are never suffered to eat any thing unclean.  Their opinion is\r\nthe same with regard to small dogs, which are kept with great care, and\r\nno one willingly injures a dog, or, if he should injure purposely, or\r\ndestroy one of them, the law would punish him.

It is given in the language of Froissart.\r\n\r\n  \"A grayhounde called Mithe, who always wayted upon the kynge, and\r\n  would knowe no man els. For when so ever the kynge did ryde, he that\r\n  kept the grayhounde dyd lette him lose, and he wolde streyght runne to\r\n  the kynge and faune uppon hym, and leape with his fore fete uppon the\r\n  kynge's shoulders. And, as the kynge and the Erle of Derby talked\r\n  togyder in the courte, the grayhounde who was wonte to leape uppon the\r\n  kynge, left the kynge and came to the Erle of Derby, Duke of\r\n  Lancastre; and made to him the same friendly continuance and chere as\r\n  he was wonte to do to the kynge. The duke, who knewe not the\r\n  grayhounde, demanded of the kynge what the grayhounde wolde do?\r\n  'Cousin,' qoud the kynge, 'it is a greate goode token to you, and an\r\n  evyl signe to me.' 'How knowe you that?' quod the duke. 'I knowe it\r\n  well,' quod the kynge. 'The grayhounde acknowledgeth you here this\r\n  daye as Kynge of England, as ye shall be, and I shal be deposed; the\r\n  grayhounde hath this knowledge naturally: therefore take hyme to you,\r\n  he wyll followe you and forsake me.' The duke understood well those\r\n  words, and cheryshed the grayhounde, who would never after followe\r\n  kynge Richarde, but followed the duke of Lancastre.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: 'Thacker on Sporting'.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The writer of this work had a brace of greyhounds as\r\narrant thieves as ever lived. They would now and then steal into the\r\ncooking-room belonging to the kennel, lift the lid from the boiler, and,\r\nif any portion of the joint or piece of meat projected above the water,\r\nsuddenly seize it, and before there was time for them to feel much of\r\nits heat, contrive to whirl it on the floor, and eat it at their leisure\r\nas it got cold. In order to prevent this, the top of the boiler was\r\nsecured by an iron rod passing under its handle of the boiler on each\r\nside; but not many days passed ere they discovered that they could gnaw\r\nthe cords asunder, and displace the rod, and fish out the meat as\r\nbefore. Small chains were then substituted for the cords, and the meat\r\nwas cooked in safety for nearly a week, when they found that, by rearing\r\nthemselves on their hind legs, and applying their united strength\r\ntowards the top of the boiler they could lift it out of its bed and roll\r\nit along the floor, and so get at the broth, although the meat was out\r\nof their reach. The man who looked after them expressed himself heartily\r\nglad when they were gone; for, he said, he was often afraid to go into\r\nthe kennel, and was sure they were devils, and not dogs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Scott's 'Sportsman's Repository', p. 97.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Blaine's 'Encyclopedia of Sporting'.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: For a set of laws for Coursing Matches. see Appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: 'Sportsman', vol. xi. p. 314]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Bell's 'British Quadrupeds', p. 241.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Tickell's 'Miscellanies']\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: 'Sporting Mag.' 1837, p. 156.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22:  'New Sports.

They constitute the most\r\n  pleasing and valuable division of the Dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spaniel is evidently the parent of the Newfoundland dog and the\r\nsetter; while the retriever, the poodle, the Bernardine, the Esquimaux,\r\nthe Siberian, and the Greenland dogs, the shepherd and drover's dog, and\r\nevery variety distinguished for intelligence and fidelity, have more or\r\nless of his blood in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANIEL\r\n\r\nis probably of Spanish origin, and thence his name. The ears are large\r\nand pendent, the tail elevated, the fur of a different length in\r\ndifferent parts of the body, but longest about the ears, under the neck,\r\nbehind the thighs and on the tail, varying in colour, but most commonly\r\nwhite with brown or black patches.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of the spaniel. The smallest of the 'land'\r\nspaniels is\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COCKER.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly used in flushing woodcocks and pheasants in thickets and\r\ncopses into which the setter, and even the springer, can scarcely enter.\r\n\r\n  \"But, if the shady woods my cares employ,\r\n  In quest of feathered game my spaniels beat,\r\n  Puzzling the entangled copse, and from the brake\r\n  Push forth the whirring pheasant.\"\r\n\r\nThe cocker is here very useful, although he is occasionally an\r\nexceedingly impatient animal. He is apt to whimper and babble as soon as\r\nhe comes upon the scent of game, and often raises the bird before the\r\nsportsman is within reach: but when he is sufficiently broken in not to\r\ngive tongue until the game rises, he is exceedingly valuable. There can\r\nscarcely be a prettier object than this little creature, full of\r\nactivity, and bustling in every direction, with his tail erect; and, the\r\nmoment he scents the bird, expressing his delight by the quivering of\r\nevery limb, and the low eager whimpering which the best breaking cannot\r\nalways subdue.\r\n\r\nPresently the bird springs, and then he shrieks out his ecstasy,\r\nstartling even the sportsman with his sharp, shrill, and strangely\r\nexpressive bark.\r\n\r\nThe most serious objection to the use of the cocker is the difficulty of\r\nteaching him to distinguish his game, and confine himself within bounds;\r\nfor he will too often flush everything that comes within his reach. It\r\nis often the practice to attach bells to his collar, that the sportsman\r\nmay know where he is; but there is an inconvenience connected with this,\r\nthat the noise of the bells will often disturb and spring the game\r\nbefore the dog comes fairly upon it.\r\n\r\nPatience and perseverance, with a due mixture of kindness and\r\ncorrection, will, however, accomplish a great deal in the tuition of the\r\nwell-bred spaniel. He may at first hunt about after every bird that\r\npresents itself, or chase the interdicted game; but, if he is\r\nimmediately called in and rated, or perhaps corrected, but not too\r\nseverely, he will learn his proper lesson, and will recognise the game,\r\nto which alone his attention must be directed. The grand secret in\r\nbreaking in these dogs is mildness, mingled with perseverance, the\r\nlessons being enforced, and practically illustrated by the example of an\r\nold and steady dog.\r\n\r\nThese spaniels will sometimes vie with almost every other species of dog\r\nin intelligence, and will not yield to one of them in fidelity. A\r\ngentleman in Sussex had an old cocker, that was his constant companion,\r\nboth in the house and the field. If the morning was rainy, the dog was\r\nperfectly quiet; if it was fine, he became restless, and, at the usual\r\ntime for his master to go out, he would take him by the flap of his\r\ncoat, and gently pull at it. If the door was opened, he ran immediately\r\nto the keeper's lodge, which was at a considerable distance from the\r\nhouse. This was a signal for the other dogs to be brought up, and then\r\nhe trotted back to announce their approach.\r\n\r\n[This beautiful and interesting dog, so called from his peculiar\r\nsuitableness for woodcock shooting, is but little known among us except\r\nas a boudoir companion for our ladies. He is, nevertheless, extensively\r\nused in England by sportsmen for finding and flushing this bird, as also\r\nthe pheasant; and no doubt, if introduced into our country, would prove\r\nequally, if not more serviceable, in putting up game concealed in the\r\nthickets and marshy hollows of our uncleared grounds. Having extremely\r\nfine scenting powers, they are also employed in greyhound coursing, to\r\ngive warning of the proximity of a hare, which they seldom fail to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nThis active little animal hunts with great spirit, and soon becomes\r\nattached to the sport; in fact the only difficulty to be overcome in\r\nbreaking him, is the effort it requires to make him suppress his natural\r\nardour and withhold his exclamations of delight till the bird is\r\nactually on the wing. The tutelage of the cocker intended for the field\r\nshould commence as early as possible, and is not, as many suppose,\r\nattended with great difficulty. His first lessons should be confined to\r\nthe art of bringing and carrying, which he soon, in common with all the\r\nother members of the spaniel tribe, learns. The next thing to be\r\ninculcated is implicit obedience to our wishes; then, at the age of four\r\nmonths or so, he may be carried to the field, where his natural fondness\r\nfor hunting will soon be developed by his chasing every bird within his\r\nreach. When this impulse is fully exhibited, and the dog expresses\r\ngratification in the amusement, he should be then instructed to give\r\nchase, or not, at his master's pleasure. When this desirable end has\r\nbeen accomplished, he may be introduced to the particular kinds of game\r\nwhich it is proposed to hunt him on, and by slow degrees teach him to\r\nconfine his attentions to those varieties alone. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary that the dog be forced to hunt as near to the sportsman as\r\npossible, otherwise the game will be flushed at such a distance that it\r\nwill be impossible to get at it. The cocker spaniel is much smaller than\r\nthe springer; his ears are long, pendulous, and silky; his body round\r\nand compact; his legs short and tufted; his coat variable; his nose\r\nblack; tail bushy and feathered, and, when hunting, is kept in constant\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nSome are black and white, others liver colour and yellow; the latter\r\nvariety we have most usually seen in this country, and some of them have\r\nbeen represented to us as well-broken and serviceable dogs.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING CHARLES'S SPANIEL,\r\n\r\nso called from the fondness of Charles II for it--who usually had some\r\nof them following him, wherever he went--belongs likewise to the\r\ncockers. Its form and character are well preserved in one of the\r\npaintings of the unfortunate parent of that monarch and his family. The\r\nears deeply fringed and sweeping the ground, the rounder form of the\r\nforehead, the larger and moister eye, the longer and silken coat, and\r\nthe clearness of the tan, and white and black colour, sufficiently\r\ndistinguish this variety. His beauty and diminutive size have consigned\r\nhim to the drawing-room or parlour.\r\n\r\nCharles the First had a breed of spaniels, very small, with the hair\r\nblack and curly. The spaniel of the second Charles was of the black and\r\ntan breed.\r\n\r\nThe King Charles's breed of the present day is materially altered for\r\nthe worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead as ugly and\r\nprominent, as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its\r\nformer size, and has an expression of stupidity with which the character\r\nof the dog too accurately corresponds. Still there is the long ear, and\r\nthe silky coat, and the beautiful colour of the hair, and for these the\r\ndealers do not scruple to ask twenty, thirty, and even fifty guineas.\r\n\r\n[This breed of dog was cultivated with such jealous care by the late\r\nDuke of Norfolk, that no solicitation or entreaty could induce this\r\nnobleman to part with one of these favourites, except under certain\r\npeculiar stipulations and injunctions, as detailed in the following\r\ninterview of Mr. Blain with the late Duchess of York. \"On one occasion,\r\nwhen we were accompanying Her Royal Highness to her menagerie, with\r\nalmost a kennel of canine favourites behind her, after drawing our\r\nattention to a jet black pug pup she had just received from Germany, she\r\nremarked that she was going to show me what she considered a present of\r\nmuch greater rarity, which was a true King Charles's breed sent to her\r\nby the Duke of Norfolk. 'But,' she observed, 'would you believe he could\r\nbe so ungallant as to write word that he must have a positive promise\r\nnot from myself, but from the Duke of York, that I should not breed from\r\nit in the direct line?'\" Notwithstanding these selfish restrictions on\r\nthe part of this noble patron of the spaniel, this breed of dog has\r\nbecome quite common in England, and not a few have found their way to\r\nthis country.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPRINGER\r\n\r\nThis dog is slower and steadier in its range than the cocker; but it is\r\na much safer dog for the shooter, and can better stand a hard day's\r\nwork. The largest and best breed of springers is said to be in Sussex,\r\nand is much esteemed in the Wealds of that county.\r\n\r\nFrom a cross with the terrier a black and tan variety was procured,\r\nwhich was cultivated by the late Duke of Norfolk, and thence called the\r\nNorfolk Spaniel. It is larger than the common springer, and stancher,\r\nand stouter. It often forms a strong individual attachment, and is\r\nunhappy and pines away when separated from its master. It is more\r\nill-tempered than the common springer, and, if not well broken in, is\r\noften exceedingly obstinate.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Skinner informs us that this breed, in its greatest purity, may be\r\nfound in the Carrollton family, as also in the possession of Mr.\r\nKeyworth of Washington city.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK AND TAN SPANIEL,\r\n\r\nthe cross of the terrier being nearly or quite got rid of, is often a\r\nbeautiful animal, and is much valued, although it is frequently\r\nconsidered a somewhat stupid animal.  The cocker and the springer are\r\nsometimes used as finders in coursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLENHEIM SPANIEL,\r\n\r\na breed cultivated by one of the Dukes of Marlborough, belongs to this\r\ndivision. From its beauty, and occasional gaiety, it is oftener an\r\ninhabitant of the drawing-room than the field; but it occasionally\r\nbreaks out, and shows what nature designed it for. Some of these\r\ncarpeted pets acquit themselves nobly in the covert. There they ought\r\noftener to be; for they have not much individuality of attachment to\r\nrecommend them, and, like other spoiled animals, both quadruped and\r\nbiped, misbehave. The breed has degenerated of late, and is not always\r\nto be had pure, even in the neighbourhood of Blenheim. This spaniel may\r\nhe distinguished by the length and silkiness of the coat, the deep\r\nfringe about the ear, the arch and deep-feathering of the tail, the full\r\nand moist eye, and the blackness of the palate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER-SPANIEL.\r\n\r\nOf this breed there are two varieties, a larger and smaller, both useful\r\naccording to the degree of range or the work required; the smaller,\r\nhowever, being ordinarily preferable. Whatever be his general size,\r\nstrength and compactness of form are requisite. His head is long, his\r\nface smooth, and his limbs, more developed than those of the springer,\r\nshould be muscular, his carcase round, and his hair long and closely\r\ncurled. Good breaking is more necessary here than even with the\r\nland-spaniel, and, fortunately, it is more easily accomplished; for, the\r\nwater-spaniel, although a stouter, is a more docile animal than the land\r\none.\r\n\r\nDocility and affection are stamped on his countenance, and he rivals\r\nevery other breed in his attachment to his master. His work is double;\r\nfirst to find, when ordered so to do, and to back behind the sportsman\r\nwhen the game will be more advantageously trodden up. In both he must be\r\ntaught to be perfectly obedient to the voice, that he may be kept within\r\nrange, and not unnecessarily disturb the birds. A more important part of\r\nhis duty, however, is to find and bring the game that has dropped. To\r\nteach him to find is easy enough, for a young water-spaniel will as\r\nreadily take to the water as a pointer puppy will stop; but to bring his\r\ngame without tearing is a more difficult lesson, and the most difficult\r\nof all is to make him suspend the pursuit of the wounded game while the\r\nsportsman re-loads.\r\n\r\nThe water-spaniel was originally from Spain; but the pure breed has been\r\nlost, and the present dog is probably descended from the large water-dog\r\nand the English setter.\r\n\r\nThe water and land spaniels differ materially from each other. The\r\nwater-spaniel, although when at his work being all that his master can\r\ndesire, is, when unemployed, comparatively a slow and inactive dog; but\r\nunder this sobriety of demeanor is concealed a strength and fidelity of\r\nattachment to which the more lively land-spaniel cannot always lay just\r\nclaim. The writer of this work once saved a young water-spaniel from the\r\npersecution of a crowd of people who had driven it into a passage, and\r\nwere pelting it with stones. The animal had the character of being,\r\ncontrary to what his species usually are, exceedingly savage; and he\r\nsuffered himself to be taken up by me and carried from his foes with a\r\nkind of sullenness; but when, being out of the reach of danger, he was\r\nput down, he gazed on his deliverer, and then crouched at his feet.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment he attached himself to his new master with an intensity\r\nof affection scarcely conceivable--never expressed by any boisterous\r\ncaresses, but by endeavouring to be in some manner in contact with him;\r\nresting his head upon his foot; lying upon some portion of his apparel,\r\nhis eye intently fixed upon him; endeavouring to understand every\r\nexpression of his countenance. He would follow one gentleman, and one\r\nonly, to the river-side, and behave gallantly and nobly there; but the\r\nmoment he was dismissed he would scamper home, gaze upon his master, and\r\nlay himself down at his feet. In one of these excursions he was shot. He\r\ncrawled home, reached his master's feet, and expired in the act of\r\nlicking his hand.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the author may be permitted to relate one story more of the\r\nwater-spaniel: he pledges himself for its perfect truth. The owner of\r\nthe dog is telling this tale.\r\n\r\n  \"I was once on the sea-coast, when a small, badly-formed, and leaky\r\n  fishing-boat was cast on shore, on a fearful reef of rocks. Three men\r\n  and a boy of ten years old constituted the crew. The men swam on\r\n  shore, but they were so bruised against the rocks, that they could not\r\n  render any assistance to the poor boy, and no person could be found to\r\n  venture out in any way. I heard the noise and went to the spot with my\r\n  dog. I spoke to him, and in he went, more like a seal than a dog, and\r\n  after several fruitless attempts to mount the wreck he succeeded, and\r\n  laid hold of the boy, who clung to the ropes, screaming in the most\r\n  fearful way at being thus dragged into the water. The waves dashed\r\n  frightfully on the rocks. In the anxiety and responsibility of the\r\n  moment I thought that the dog had missed him, and I stripped off my\r\n  clothes, resolved to render what assistance I could. I was just in the\r\n  act of springing from the shore, having selected the moment when the\r\n  receding waves gave me the best chance of rendering any assistance,\r\n  when I saw old 'Bagsman,' for that was the name of my dog, with the\r\n  struggling boy in his mouth, and the head uppermost. I rushed to the\r\n  place where he must land, and the waves bore the boy and the dog into\r\n  my arms.\r\n\r\n  \"Some time after that I was shooting wild-fowl. I and my dog had been\r\n  working hard, and I left him behind me while I went to a neighbouring\r\n  town to purchase gunpowder. A man, in a drunken frolic, had pushed off\r\n  in a boat with a girl in it; the tide going out carried the boat\r\n  quickly away, and the man becoming frightened, and unable to swim,\r\n  jumped overboard. Bagsman, who was on the spot, hearing the splash,\r\n  jumped in, swam out to the man, caught hold of him, and brought him\r\n  twenty yards towards the shore, when the drunken fellow clasped the\r\n  dog tight round the body, and they both went down together. The girl\r\n  was saved by a boat going to her assistance. The body of the man was\r\n  recovered about an hour afterwards, with that of the dog clasped tight\r\n  in his arms, thus dragging him to the bottom. 'Poor Bagsman! thy worth\r\n  deserves to be thus chronicled.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POODLE.\r\n\r\nThe particular cross from which this dog descended is unknown, but the\r\nvariety produced has been carefully preserved. It is, probably, of\r\ncontinental origin, and is known by its thick curly hair concealing\r\nalmost every part of the face, and giving it the appearance of a short,\r\nthick, unintelligent head. When, however, that hair is removed, there is\r\nstill the large head; but there is also the cerebral cavity more\r\ncapacious than in any other dog, and the frontal sinuses fully\r\ndeveloped, and exhibiting every indication of the intellectual class to\r\nwhich it belongs.\r\n\r\nIt was originally a water-dog, as its long and curly hair, and its\r\npropensities in its domesticated state, prove; but, from its peculiar\r\nsagacity, it is capable of being trained to almost any useful purpose,\r\nand its strong individual attachment renders it more the companion of\r\nman than a mere sporting dog: indeed, its qualities as a sporting dog\r\nare seldom recognised by its owner.\r\n\r\nThese dogs have far more courage than the water-spaniel, all the\r\nsagacity of the Newfoundland, more general talent, if the expression may\r\nbe used, and more individual attachment than either of them, and without\r\nthe fawning of the one, or the submissiveness of the other. The poodle\r\nseems conscious of his worth, and there is often a quiet dignity\r\naccompanying his demonstrations of friendship.\r\n\r\nThis dog, however, possesses a very peculiar kind of intelligence. It\r\nwill almost perform the common offices of a servant: it will ring the\r\nbell and open the door. Mr. Wilkie, of Ladythorn in Northumberland, had\r\na poodle which he had instructed to go through all the apparent agonies\r\nof dying. He would fall on one side, stretch himself out, and move his\r\nhind legs as if he were in great pain; he would next simulate the\r\nconvulsive throbs of departing life, and then stretch out his limbs and\r\nthus seem as if he had expired. In this situation he would remain\r\nmotionless, until he had his master's command to rise.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Sancho, a poodle, that was with difficulty forced from\r\nthe grave of his master, after the battle of Salamanca, is familiar to\r\nmany of our readers. Enticed from his post he could not be, nor was he\r\nat length taken away until weakened by grief and starvation. He by\r\ndegrees attached himself to his new master, the Marquis of Worcester,\r\nbut not with the natural ardour of a poodle. He was attentive to every\r\ncommand, and could perform many little domestic offices. Sometimes he\r\nwould exhibit considerable buoyancy of spirit; but there oftener seemed\r\nto be about him the recollection of older and closer friendship.\r\n\r\nAnother poodle occupies an interesting place in the history of the\r\nPeninsular war. He too belonged to a French officer, who was killed at\r\nthe battle of Castella. The French were compelled to retreat before they\r\ncould bury their dead, and the soldiers wished to carry with them their\r\nregimental favourite; but he would not be forced from the corpse of his\r\nmaster. Some soldiers afterwards traversing the field of battle, one of\r\nthem discovered the cross of the Legion of Honour on the breast of the\r\nfallen officer, and stooped to take it away, when the dog flew savagely\r\nat him, and would not quit his hold, until the bayonet of another\r\nsoldier laid him lifeless.\r\n\r\nA veterinary surgeon, who, before any other animal than the horse was\r\nacknowledged to be the legitimate object of medical care, did not\r\ndisdain to attend to the diseases of the dog, used to say that there\r\nwere two breeds which he never wished to see in his infirmary, namely,\r\nthe poodle and the Norfolk spaniel; for, although not always difficult\r\nto manage, he could never attach them to him, but they annoyed him by\r\ntheir pitiful and imploring gaze during the day, and their mournful\r\nhowling at night.\r\n\r\nCustom has determined that the natural coat of this animal shall be\r\ntaken from him. It may be a relief to the poodle for a part of his coat\r\nto be stripped off in hot weather, and the curly hair which is left on\r\nhis chest, contrasted with his smooth and well-rounded loins and\r\nquarters, may make it look pretty enough; but it should he remembered\r\nthat he was not designed by nature to be thus exposed to the cold of\r\nwinter, and that there are no dogs so liable to rheumatism, and that\r\nrheumatism degenerating into palsy, as the well-trimmed poodle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARBET\r\n\r\nis a small poodle, the production of some unknown and disadvantageous\r\ncross with the true poodle. It has all the sagacity of the poodle, and\r\nwill perform even more than his tricks. It is always in action; always\r\nfidgety; generally incapable of much affection, but inheriting much\r\nself-love and occasional ill temper; unmanageable by any one but its\r\nowner; eaten up with red mange; and frequently a nuisance to its master\r\nand a torment to every one else.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, do it injustice; it is very intelligent, and truly\r\nattached to its owner.\r\n\r\nThe barbet possesses more sagacity than most other dogs, but it is\r\nsagacity of a particular kind, and frequently connected with various\r\namusing tricks. Mr. Jesse, in his Gleanings in Natural History, gives a\r\nsingular illustration of this. A friend of his had a barbet that was not\r\nalways under proper command. In order to keep him in better order, he\r\npurchased a small whip, with which he corrected him once or twice during\r\na walk. On his return the whip was put on a table in the hall, but on\r\nthe next morning it was missing. It was soon afterwards found concealed\r\nin an out-building, and again made use of in correcting the dog. Once\r\nmore it would have been lost, but, on watching the dog, who was\r\nsuspected of having stolen it, he was seen to take it from the hall\r\ntable in order to hide it once more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MALTESE DOG\r\n\r\ncan be traced back to an early period. Strabo says that\r\n\r\n  \"there is a town in Sicily called Melita, whence are exported many\r\n  beautiful dogs called 'Canes Melitæi'. They were the peculiar\r\n  favourites of the women; but now (A.D. 25) there is less account made\r\n  of these animals, which are not bigger than common ferrets or weasels,\r\n  yet they are not small in understanding nor unstable in their love.\"\r\n\r\nThey are also found in Malta and in other islands of the Mediterranean,\r\nand they maintain the same character of being devotedly affectionate to\r\ntheir owners, while, it is added,--and they are not loved the less for\r\nthat,--they are ill-tempered to strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LION DOG\r\n\r\nis a diminutive likeness of the noble animal whose name it bears. Its\r\nhead, neck, shoulders, and fore-legs down to the very feet, are covered\r\nwith long, wavy, silky hairs. On the other parts of the dog it is so\r\nshort as scarcely to be grasped, except that on the tail there is a\r\nsmall bush of hair. The origin of this breed is not known; it is,\r\nperhaps, an intermediate one between the Maltese and the Turkish dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKISH DOG,\r\n\r\nas it is improperly called, is a native of hot climates. The supposition\r\nof Buffon is not an improbable one, that, being taken from some\r\ntemperate country to one considerable hotter, the European dog probably\r\nacquired some cutaneous disease. This is no uncommon occurrence in\r\nGuinea, the East Indies, and South America. Some of these animals\r\nafterwards found their way into Europe, and, from their singularity,\r\ncare was taken to multiply the breed. Aldrovandus states that the first\r\ntwo of them made their appearance in Europe in his time, but the breed\r\nwas not continued, on account, as it was supposed, of the climate being\r\ntoo cold for them.\r\n\r\nThe few that are occasionally seen in England bear about them every mark\r\nof a degenerated race. They have no activity, and they show little\r\nintelligence or affection. One singular circumstance appertains to all\r\nthat the author of this work has had the opportunity of seeing,--their\r\nteeth become very early diseased, and drop from the gums. That eminent\r\nzoologist, Mr. Yarrell, examining, with the author of this work, one\r\nthat had died, certainly not more than five years old, found that it had\r\nneither incisors nor canine teeth, and that the molars were reduced to\r\none on each side, the large tubercular tooth being the only one that was\r\nremaining. At the scientific meeting of the Zoological Society, the same\r\ngentleman stated, that he had examined the mouths of two individuals of\r\nthe same variety, then alive at the gardens, in both of which the teeth\r\nwere remarkably deficient. In neither of them were there any false\r\nmolars, and the incisors in both were deficient in number. Before the\r\nage of four years the tongue is usually disgustingly hanging from the\r\nmouths of these animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALPINE SPANIEL, OR BERNARDINE DOG,\r\n\r\nis a breed almost peculiar to the Alps, and to the district between\r\nSwitzerland and Savoy. The passes over these mountains are exceedingly\r\ndangerous from their steepness and narrowness. A precipice of many\r\nhundred feet is often found on one side, and perpendicular rocks on the\r\nother, while the path is glazed with frozen snow or ice. In many places\r\nthe path is overhung with huge masses of frozen snow, which occasionally\r\nloosen and fall, when the dreadful storms peculiar to these regions\r\nsuddenly come on, and form an insurmountable barrier, or sweep away or\r\nbury the unfortunate traveller. Should he escape these dangers, the path\r\nis now become trackless, and he wanders amid the dreary solitudes until\r\nnight overtakes him; and then, when he pauses from fatigue or\r\nuncertainty with regard to the path he should pursue, his limbs are\r\nspeedily benumbed. Fatal slumbers, which he cannot shake off, steal upon\r\nhim, and he crouches under some ledge and sleeps, to wake no more. The\r\nsnow drifts on. It is almost continually falling, and he is soon\r\nconcealed from all human help.\r\n\r\nOn the top of Mount St. Bernard, and near one of the most dangerous of\r\nthese passes, is a convent, in which is preserved a breed of large dogs\r\ntrained to search for the benighted and frozen wanderer. Every night,\r\nand particularly when the wind blows tempestuously, some of these dogs\r\nare sent out. They traverse every path about the mountains, and their\r\nscent is so exquisite that they can discover the traveller, although he\r\nmay lie many feet deep in the snow. Having found him, they set to work\r\nand endeavour to scrape away the snow, uttering a deep bark that\r\nreverberates from rock to rock, and tells those who are watching in the\r\nconvent that some poor wretch is in peril. Generally, a little flask of\r\nspirits is tied round the neck of the animal, by drinking which the\r\nbenighted traveller may recruit his strength, until more effectual\r\nrescue arrive. The monks hasten in the direction of the sound, and often\r\nsucceed in rekindling the vital spark before it is quite extinguished.\r\nVery many travellers have been thus rescued from death by these\r\nbenevolent men and their intelligent and interesting quadruped servants.\r\n\r\nOne of these Bernardine dogs, named Barry, had a medal tied round his\r\nneck as a badge of honourable distinction, for he had saved the lives of\r\nforty persons. He at length died nobly in his vocation. A Piedmontese\r\ncourier arrived at St. Bernard on a very stormy day, labouring to make\r\nhis way to the little village of St. Pierre, in the valley beneath the\r\nmountain, where his wife and children lived. It was in vain that the\r\nmonks attempted to check his resolution to reach his family. They at\r\nlast gave him two guides, each of whom was accompanied by a dog, one of\r\nwhich was the remarkable creature whose service had been so valuable.\r\nDescending from the convent, they were overwhelmed by two avalanches or\r\nheaps of falling snow, and the same destruction awaited the family of\r\nthe poor courier, who were travelling up the mountain in the hope of\r\nobtaining some news of the husband and father.\r\n\r\nA beautiful engraving has been made of this noble dog. It represents him\r\nas saving a child which he had found in the Glacier of Balsore, and\r\ncherished, and warmed, and induced to climb on his shoulders, and thus\r\npreserved from, otherwise, certain destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEWFOUNDLAND DOG.\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland is a spaniel of large size. He is a native of the\r\nisland of which he bears the name; but his history is disgraceful to the\r\nowners of so valuable an animal. The employment of the lower classes of\r\nthe inhabitants of St. John, in Newfoundland, is divided between the\r\ncutting of wood, and the drawing of it and other merchandise in the\r\nwinter, and fishing in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe carts used in the winter work are drawn by these dogs, who are\r\nalmost invariably urged and goaded on beyond their strength, fed only\r\nwith putrid salt-fish, and an inadequate quantity even of that. A great\r\nmany of them are worn out and die before the winter is over; and, when\r\nthe summer approaches, and the fishing season commences, many of them\r\nare quite abandoned, and, uniting with their companions, prowl about\r\npreying on the neighbouring flocks, or absolutely starving.\r\n\r\nMr. Macgregor, however, states that\r\n\r\n  \"in almost every other part of British America they are valuable and\r\n  useful. They are remarkably docile and obedient to their masters,\r\n  serviceable in all the fishing countries, and yoked in pairs to draw\r\n  the winter's fuel home. They are faithful, good-natured, and ever\r\n  friendly to man. They will defend their master and their master's\r\n  property, and suffer no person to injure either the one or the other;\r\n  and, however extreme may be the danger, they will not leave them for a\r\n  minute. They seem only to want the faculty of speech, in order to make\r\n  their good wishes and feelings understood, and they are capable of\r\n  being trained for all the purposes for which every other variety of\r\n  the canine species is used\".[1]\r\n\r\nThat which most recommends the Newfoundland dog is his fearlessness of\r\nwater, and particularly as connected with the preservation of human\r\nlife. The writer of the present work knows one of these animals that has\r\npreserved from drowning four human beings.\r\n\r\n[This breed of dog, though much esteemed both in England and other\r\nportions of the world, as well for his majestic appearance as for many\r\nuseful and winning traits of character, has but few sportsmen as patrons\r\nwith us. He is not only used in England as a water-dog for the pursuit\r\nof wild fowl, but has been trained by many sportsmen to hunt on\r\npartridges, woodcocks, and pheasants, and is represented by Captain\r\nHawker and others as surpassing all others of the canine race, in\r\nfinding wounded game of every description.\r\n\r\nMr. Blain remarks that,\r\n\r\n  \"as a retriever, the Newfoundland dog is easily brought to do almost\r\n  anything that is required of him, and he is so tractable, likewise,\r\n  that, with the least possible trouble, he may be safely taken among\r\n  pointers to the field, with whose province he will not interfere, but\r\n  will be overjoyed to be allowed to look up the wounded game, which he\r\n  will do with a perseverance that no speed and no distance can slacken,\r\n  nor any hedge-row baulk. In cover he is very useful; some, indeed,\r\n  shoot woodcocks to a Newfoundland, and he never shines more than when\r\n  he is returning with a woodcock, pheasant, or hare, in his mouth,\r\n  which he yields up, or even puts into your hand unmutilated.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the high commendations of these gentlemen, we cannot\r\nlook upon the Newfoundland in any other light than that of a dog, whose\r\npowers of sagacity are destined for display in the water.\r\n\r\nIn contending with this element, either in the preservation of human\r\nlife, or in search of wounded fowl, he has no equal, and volumes might\r\nbe filled with accounts of his various daring achievements in this\r\nparticular branch, not only in England, but on the rivers of our own\r\ncountry. Mr. Blain mentions two varieties of these dogs as being common\r\nin England, the Labrador and St. John. The former is very large,\r\nrough-haired, and carries his tail very high; the latter is smaller,\r\nmore docile, and sagacious in the extreme, and withal much more\r\nmanageable. We were not aware of these varieties, and more particularly\r\nas regards the difference in docility and sagacity, but are convinced,\r\nfrom subsequent observations, that such is the case even in our own\r\ncountry, for we have often noticed a great dissimilarity in the size and\r\nappearance of these dogs and attributed it to the effects of the climate\r\nand cross breeding with inferior animals. We are indebted to Mr. Skinner\r\nfor bringing before the public a faithful and minute account of two of\r\nthese animals imported into this country by Mr. Law, of Baltimore, and\r\nmay be pardoned for giving again publicity to this gentleman's letter in\r\nrelation to these two sagacious brutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, January 7th, 1845.\r\n\r\n  \"MY DEAR SIR:--In the fall of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton,\r\n  belonging to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we\r\n  fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial\r\n  gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the\r\n  crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Poole, in\r\n  England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from\r\n  the Canton, which was sent to take off the English crew, the brig's\r\n  own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of\r\n  intoxication. I found on board of her two Newfoundland pups, male and\r\n  female, which I saved, and, subsequently, on our landing the English\r\n  crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased\r\n  these two pups of the English captain for a guinea a-piece. Being\r\n  bound again to sea, I gave the dog-pup, which was called Sailor, to\r\n  Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut-pup, which was called\r\n  Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which\r\n  the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his\r\n  brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had\r\n  directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of\r\n  the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and\r\n  that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The\r\n  dog was of a dingy red colour, and the slut black. They were not\r\n  large; their hair was short, but very thick coated; they had dew\r\n  claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most\r\n  sagacious in everything, particularly so in all duties connected with\r\n  duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Mexican ram for the dog at\r\n  the time of the merino fever, when such rams were selling for many\r\n  hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore\r\n  of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after,\r\n  and may still he known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor\r\n  breed. The slut remained at Sparrow's Point till her death, and her\r\n  progeny were, and are still, well known through Patapsco Neck, on the\r\n  Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed\r\n  for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer\r\n  relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performances\r\n  of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such\r\n  particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect\r\n  with sufficient accuracy to repeat.\r\n\r\n  Yours, in haste,\r\n\r\n  GEORGE LAW.\"\r\n\r\nThese dogs are represented as being of fine carriage, broad-chested,\r\ncompact figure, and in every respect built for strength and activity.\r\n\r\nTheir patience and endurance were very great when pursuing wounded ducks\r\nthrough the floating ice, and when fatigued from extraordinary exertions\r\nwere known to rest themselves upon broken portions of ice till\r\nsufficiently recovered again to commence the chase. We have seen some of\r\nthe descendants of these sagacious animals on the Chesapeake, engaged,\r\nnot only in bringing the ducks from the water when shot, but also toling\r\nthem into shore within range of the murderous batteries concealed behind\r\nthe blind.\r\n\r\nThis may not be an inappropriate place to speak of this wonderful mode\r\nof decoying ducks, termed toling, so extensively practised upon the\r\nChesapeake bay and its tributaries, where the canvass-back and red-heads\r\nresort in such numerous quantities every fall. A species of mongrel\r\nwater-dog, or often any common cur, is taught to run backwards and\r\nforwards after stones, sticks, or other missiles thrown from one side to\r\nthe other. In his activity and industry in this simple branch of\r\neducation, within the comprehension of any dog, consists the almost\r\nincredible art of toling the canvass-back.\r\n\r\nWith a dog of this character, the shooting party, consisting of several\r\npersons all prepared with heavy double-barrelled duck-guns, ensconce\r\nthemselves at break of day behind some one of the numerous blinds\r\ntemporarily erected along the shore contiguous to the feeding-grounds of\r\nthese ducks. Everything being arranged, and the morning mists cleared\r\noff, the ducks will be seen securely feeding on the shallows not less\r\nthan several hundreds of yards from the shore. The dog is now put in\r\nmotion by throwing stones from one side of the blind to the other. This\r\nwill soon be perceived by the ducks, who, stimulated by an extreme\r\ndegree of curiosity, and feeling anxious to inform themselves as to this\r\nsudden and singular phenomenon, raise their heads high in the water and\r\ncommence swimming for the shore. The dog being kept in motion, the ducks\r\nwill not arrest their progress until within a few feet of the water's\r\nedge, and oftentimes will stand on the shore staring, as it were, in\r\nmute and silly astonishment at the playful motions of the dog.\r\n\r\nIf well trained the dog takes no notice whatever of the duck, but\r\ncontinues his fascination until the quick report of the battery\r\nannounces to him that his services are now wanted in another quarter,\r\nand he immediately rushes into the water to arrest the flight of the\r\nmaimed and wounded, who, struggling on every side, dye the water with\r\ntheir rich blood.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this mode of decoying ducks was quite an accident,\r\nbeing attributed to a circumstance noticed by a sportsman, who,\r\nconcealed behind a blind patiently awaiting the near approach of the\r\ncanvass-back, observed that they suddenly lifted up their heads and\r\nmoved towards the shore. Wondering at this singular and unusual\r\nprocedure on the part of this wray bird, he naturally looked round to\r\ndiscover the cause, and observed a young fox sporting upon the river\r\nbank, and the ducks, all eagerness to gaze upon him, were steering their\r\ncourse directly for the shore.\r\n\r\nThese ducks will not only be decoyed by the dog, but will often come in\r\nby waving a fancy coloured handkerchief attached to the ramrod. We have\r\nseen a dog fail to attract their attention till bound around the loins\r\nwith a white handkerchief, and then succeed perfectly well. The toling\r\nseason continues about three weeks from the first appearance of the\r\nducks, often a much shorter time, as these birds become more cautious,\r\nand are no longer deceived in this way.\r\n\r\nThe canvass-back toles better than any other duck; in fact, it is\r\nasserted by many sportsmen, that this particular variety alone can be\r\ndecoyed in this mode. There are always numbers of other ducks feeding\r\nwith the canvass-back, particularly the red-heads and black-necks, who\r\npartake of the top of the grass that the canvas-back discards after\r\neating off the root, which is a kind of celery. These ducks, though they\r\ncome in with the canvass-back when toled, do not seem to take any notice\r\nwhatever of the dog, but continue to swim along, carelessly feeding, as\r\nif entrusting themselves entirely to the guidance of the other ducks.\r\n\r\nAs far as we have been able to judge, we are inclined to this opinion\r\nalso, and do not recollect ever having succeeded in toling any other\r\nspecies of duck, unaccompanied by the canvass-back, although we have\r\nmade the effort many times. These ducks are a very singular bird, and\r\nalthough very cunning under ordinary circumstances, seem perfectly\r\nbewildered upon this subject, as we were one of a party several years\r\nsince, who actually succeeded in decoying the same batch of ducks three\r\nsuccessive times in the course of an hour, and slaying at each fire a\r\nlarge number, as we counted out over forty at the conclusion of the\r\nsport.\r\n\r\nAlthough the toling of ducks is so simple in its process, there are few\r\ndogs that have sufficient industry and perseverance to arrive at any\r\ndegree of perfection in the art. The dog, if not possessed of some\r\nsagacity and considerable training, is very apt to tire and stop running\r\nwhen the ducks have got near to the shore, but too far to be reached by\r\nthe guns, which spoils all, as the birds are very apt to swim or fly off\r\nif the motion of the animal is arrested for a few moments.--L.]\r\n\r\nA native of Germany was travelling one evening on foot through Holland,\r\naccompanied by a large dog. Walking on a high bank which formed one side\r\nof a dyke, his foot slipped, and he was precipitated into the water;\r\nand, being unable to swim, soon became senseless. When he recovered his\r\nrecollection, he found himself in a cottage on the contrary side of the\r\ndyke, surrounded by peasants, who had been using the means for the\r\nrecovery of drowned persons. The account given by one of them was, that,\r\nreturning home from his labour, he observed at a considerable distance a\r\nlarge dog in the water, swimming and dragging, and sometimes pushing\r\nalong something that he seemed to have great difficulty in supporting,\r\nbut which he at length succeeded in getting into a small creek on the\r\nopposite side. When the animal had pulled what he had hitherto supported\r\nas far out of the water as he was able, the peasant discovered that it\r\nwas the body of a man, whose face and hands the dog was industriously\r\nlicking. The peasant hastened to a bridge across the dyke, and, having\r\nobtained assistance, the body was conveyed to a neighbouring house,\r\nwhere proper means soon restored the drowned man to life. Two very\r\nconsiderable bruises, with the marks of teeth, appeared, one on his\r\nshoulder and the other on his poll; hence it was presumed that the\r\nfaithful beast had first seized his master by the shoulder, and swam\r\nwith him in this manner for some time, but that his sagacity had\r\nprompted him to quit this hold, and to shift it to the nape of the neck,\r\nby which he had been enabled to support the head out of water; and in\r\nthis way he had conveyed him nearly a quarter of a mile before he had\r\nbrought him to the creek, where the banks were low and accessible.\r\n\r\nDr. Beattie relates an instance of a gentleman attempting to cross the\r\nriver Dee, then frozen over, near Aberdeen. The ice gave way about the\r\nmiddle of the river; but, having a gun in his hand, he supported himself\r\nby placing it across the opening. His dog then ran to a neighbouring\r\nvillage, where, with the most significant gestures, he pulled a man by\r\nthe coat, and prevailed on him to follow him. They arrived at the spot\r\njust in time to save the drowning man's life.\r\n\r\nOf the noble disposition of the Newfoundland dog, Dr. Abel, in one of\r\nhis lectures on Phrenology, relates a singular instance.\r\n\r\n  \"When this dog left his master's house, he was often assailed by a\r\n  number of little noisy dogs in the street. He usually passed them with\r\n  apparent unconcern, as if they were beneath his notice; but one little\r\n  cur was particularly troublesome, and at length carried his impudence\r\n  so far as to bite the Newfoundland dog in the leg. This was a degree\r\n  of wanton insult beyond what he could patiently endure; and he\r\n  instantly turned round, ran after the offender, and seized him by the\r\n  skin of the back. In this way he carried him in his mouth to the quay,\r\n  and, holding him some time over the water, at length dropped him into\r\n  it. He did not, however, seem to design that the culprit should be\r\n  punished capitally. He waited a little while, until the poor animal,\r\n  who was unused to that element, was not only well ducked, but nearly\r\n  sinking, and then plunged in, and brought him safe to land.\"\r\n\r\n  \"It would be difficult,\" says Dr. Hancock, in his Essay on Instinct,\r\n  \"to conceive any punishment more aptly contrived or more completely in\r\n  character. Indeed, if it were fully analyzed, an ample commentary\r\n  might be written in order to show what a variety of comparisons and\r\n  motives and generous feelings entered into the composition of this\r\n  act.\"\r\n\r\nNo one ever drew more legitimate consequence from certain existing\r\npremises.\r\n\r\nOne other story should not be omitted of this noble breed of water-dogs.\r\nA vessel was driven on the beach of Lydd, in Kent. The surf was rolling\r\nfuriously. Eight poor fellows were crying for help, but not a boat could\r\nbe got off to their assistance. At length a gentleman came on the beach\r\naccompanied by his Newfoundland dog: he directed the attention of the\r\nanimal to the vessel, and put a short stick into his mouth. The\r\nintelligent and courageous fellow at once understood his meaning, sprung\r\ninto the sea, and fought his way through the waves. He could not,\r\nhowever, get close enough to the vessel to deliver that with which he\r\nwas charged; but the crew understood what was meant, and they made fast\r\na rope to another piece of wood, and threw it towards him. The noble\r\nbeast dropped his own piece of wood and immediately seized that which\r\nhad been cast to him, and then, with a degree of strength and\r\ndetermination scarcely credible,--for he was again and again lost under\r\nthe waves,--he dragged it through the surge and delivered it to his\r\nmaster. A line of communication was thus formed, and every man on board\r\nwas rescued.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a more remarkable fact recorded in the Penny\r\nMagazine.\r\n\r\n  \"During a heavy gale a ship had struck on a rock near the land. The\r\n  only chance of escape for the shipwrecked was to get a rope ashore;\r\n  for it was impossible for any boat to live in the sea as it was then\r\n  running. There were two Newfoundland dogs and a bull-dog on board. One\r\n  of the Newfoundland dogs was thrown overboard, with a rope thrown\r\n  round him, and perished in the waves. The second shared a similar\r\n  fate: but the bull-dog fought his way through that terrible sea, and,\r\n  arriving safe onshore, rope and all, became the saviour of the crew.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the true Newfoundland dogs have been brought to Europe and have\r\nbeen used as retrievers. They are principally valuable for the fearless\r\nmanner in which they will penetrate the thickest cover. They are\r\ncomparatively small, but muscular, strong, and generally black. A larger\r\nvariety has been bred, and is now perfectly established. He is seldom\r\nused as a sporting dog, or for draught, but is admired on account of his\r\nstature and beauty, and the different colours with which he is often\r\nmarked. Perhaps he is not quite so good-natured and manageable as the\r\nsmaller variety, and yet it is not often that much fault can be found\r\nwith him on this account.\r\n\r\nA noble animal of this kind was presented to the Zoological Society by\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Albert. He is a great ornament to the gardens;\r\nbut he had been somewhat unmanageable, and had done some mischief before\r\nhe was sent thither.\r\n\r\nA portion of Lord Byron's beautiful epitaph on the death of his\r\nNewfoundland dog will properly close our account of this animal:\r\n\r\n  \"The poor dog! In life the firmest friend,\r\n  The first to welcome, foremost to defend;\r\n  Whose honest heart is still his master's own;\r\n  Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone.\"\r\n\r\n[Notwithstanding the many excellent qualities so conspicuous in this\r\nnoble breed of dog, he is said to possess one most ungenerous trait of\r\ncharacter, \"a peculiar antipathy to sheep,\" and if not early trained to\r\nendure their presence, will take every opportunity to destroy these\r\ninnocent animals.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESQUIMAUX DOG\r\n\r\nis a beast of burden and of draught, usefully employed by the\r\ninhabitants of the extreme parts of North America and the neighbouring\r\nislands. When the Esquimaux Indian goes in pursuit of the seal, the\r\nrein-deer, or the bear, his dogs carry the materials of his temporary\r\nhut, and the few necessaries of his simple life; or, yoked to the\r\nsledge, often draw him and his family full sixty miles a-day over the\r\nfrozen plains of these inhospitable regions. At other times they assist\r\nin the chase, and run down and destroy the bear and the rein-deer on\r\nland, and the seal on the coast.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are very early trained to the work which they are destined to\r\nfollow, and even at the tender age of four or five months are harnessed\r\ntogether or in company with older animals, and are compelled, either by\r\npersuasion or brutal chastisement, to draw heavy weights, and thus soon\r\nbecome accustomed to the trammels of the rude gearing, and familiar with\r\nthe service that they afterwards perform with so much sagacity and\r\nalacrity.\r\n\r\nCapt. Lyon states that they are very similar in appearance to the\r\nshepherd dog of England, but more muscular and broad chested, owing to\r\nsevere work; ears pointed, of a savage appearance; the finer dogs are\r\nequal to the Newfoundland breed in point of height and general symmetry.\r\n\r\nIt is also somewhat curious to be informed that these dogs have no\r\nparticular season of oestrum, but bear young indiscriminately at all\r\ntimes of the year, cold or warm, having very little or no effect upon\r\ntheir reproductive powers, being often seen in heat during the month of\r\nDecember when the thermometer was forty degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nTheir journeys are often without any certain object; but, if the dogs\r\nscent the deer or the bear, they gallop away in that direction until\r\ntheir prey is within reach of the driver, or they are enabled to assist\r\nin destroying their foe. Captain Parry, in his Journal of a 'Second\r\nVoyage for the Discovery of a North-West Passage', gives an amusing\r\naccount of these expeditions.\r\n\r\n  \"A number of dogs, varying from six to twelve, are attached to each\r\n  sledge by means of a single trace, but with no reins. An old and tried\r\n  dog is placed as the leader, who, in their simple journeys, and when\r\n  the chase is the object, steadily obeys the voice of the driver\r\n  sitting in front of the sledge, with a whip long enough to reach the\r\n  leader. This whip, however, is used as seldom as possible; for these\r\n  dogs, although tractable, are ferocious, and will endure little\r\n  correction. When the whip is applied with severity on one, he falls\r\n  upon and worries his neighbour, and he, in his turn, attacks a third,\r\n  and there is a scene of universal confusion, or the dogs double from\r\n  side to side to avoid the whip, and the traces become entangled, and\r\n  the safety of the sledge endangered. The carriage must then be\r\n  stopped, each dog put into his proper place, and the traces\r\n  re-adjusted. This frequently happens several times in the course of\r\n  the day. The driver therefore depends principally on the docility of\r\n  the leader, who, with admirable precision, quickens or slackens his\r\n  pace, and starts off or stops, or turns to the right or left, at the\r\n  summons of his master. When they are journeying homeward, or\r\n  travelling to some spot to which the leader has been accustomed to go,\r\n  he is generally suffered to pursue his own course; for, although every\r\n  trace of the road is lost in the drifting snow, he scents it out, and\r\n  follows it with undeviating accuracy. Even the leader, however, is not\r\n  always under the control of his master. If the journey lies homeward,\r\n  he will go his own pace, and that is usually at the top of his speed;\r\n  or, if any game starts, or he scents it at a distance, no command of\r\n  his driver will restrain him. Neither the dog nor his master is half\r\n  civilized or subdued.\"\r\n\r\nEach of these dogs will draw a weight of 120 lb. over the snow, at the\r\nrate of seven or eight miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[It is extraordinary to consider the powers and wonderful speed of these\r\nanimals, almost equalling that of many horses.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lyon informs us that three dogs drew a sledge weighing 100 lbs.\r\nand himself, one mile in six minutes; his leader dog, which is generally\r\nmore powerful than the others, drew 196 lb. the same distance in eight\r\nminutes; seven dogs ran one mile in four minutes and thirty seconds,\r\nwith a heavy sledge full of men attached to them; ten dogs ran one mile\r\nin five minutes; nine dogs drew 1611 lb. the same distance in nine\r\nminutes.--'Lyon's Journal', p. 243.--L.]\r\n\r\nIn summer, many of these dogs are used as beasts of burden, and each\r\ncarries from thirty to fifty pounds. They are then much better kept than\r\nin the winter; for they have the remains of the whale and sea-calf,\r\nwhich their masters disdain to eat. The majority, however, are sent\r\nadrift in the summer, and they live on the produce of the chase or of\r\ntheir constant thievery. The exactness with which, the summer being\r\npast, each returns to his master, is an admirable proof of sagacity, and\r\nfrequently of attachment.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Siberia, on the borders of the Oby, there are\r\nestablished relays of dogs, like the post-horses in other countries.\r\nFour of these are attached to a very light vehicle; but, when much haste\r\nis required, or any very heavy goods are to be conveyed, more than\r\ntreble or quadruple that number are harnessed to the vehicle. M. de\r\nLesseps [2] gives an almost incredible account of this. He is speaking\r\nof the voracity of these poor beasts, in the midst of the snowy desert,\r\nwith little or no food.\r\n\r\n  \"We had unharnessed our dogs, in order to bring them closer together,\r\n  in the ordinary way; but, the moment they were brought up to the pole,\r\n  they seized their harness, constructed of the thickest and toughest\r\n  leather, and tore it to pieces, and devoured it. It was in vain that\r\n  we attempted every means of restraint. A great number of them escaped\r\n  into the wilds around, others wandered here and there, and seized\r\n  everything that came within their reach, and which their teeth could\r\n  destroy. Almost every minute some one of them fell exhausted, and\r\n  immediately became the prey of the others. Every one that could get\r\n  within reach struggled for his share. Every limb was disputed, and\r\n  torn away by a troop of rivals, who attacked all within their reach.\r\n  As soon as one fell by exhaustion or accident, he was seized by a\r\n  dozen others, and destroyed in the space of a few minutes. In order to\r\n  defend ourselves from this crowd of famished beasts, we were compelled\r\n  to have recourse to our bludgeons and our swords. To this horrible\r\n  scene of mutual destruction succeeded, on the following day, the sad\r\n  appearance of those that surrounded the sledge, to which we had\r\n  retreated for safety and for warmth. They were thin, and starved, and\r\n  miserable; they could scarcely move; their plaintive and continual\r\n  howlings seemed to claim our succour; but there was no possibility of\r\n  relieving them in the slightest degree, except that some of them crept\r\n  to the opening in our carriage through which the smoke escapes; and\r\n  the more they felt the warmth closer they crept, and then, through\r\n  mere feebleness, losing their equilibrium, they rolled into the fire\r\n  before our eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThese dogs are not so high as the common pointer, but much larger and\r\nstouter, although their thick hair, three or four inches long in the\r\nwinter, gives them an appearance of more stoutness than they possess.\r\nUnder this hair is a coating of fine close soft wool, which begins to\r\ngrow in the early part of winter, and drops off in the spring. Their\r\nmuzzles are sharp and generally black, and their ears erect.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland, and Siberian, and Kamtschatdale are varieties of the\r\nEsquimaux or Arctic dogs, but enlarged in form, and better subdued. The\r\ndocility of some of these is equal to that of any European breed.\r\n\r\nA person of the name of Chabert, who was afterwards better known by the\r\ntitle of \"Fire King,\" had a beautiful Siberian dog, who would draw him\r\nin a light carriage 20 miles a day. He asked £200 for him, and sold him\r\nfor a considerable portion of that sum; for he was a most beautiful\r\nanimal of his kind, and as docile as he was beautiful. Between the sale\r\nand the delivery, the dog fell and broke his leg. Chabert, to whom the\r\nprice agreed on was of immense consequence, was in despair. He took the\r\ndog at night to a veterinary surgeon. He formally introduced them to\r\neach other. He talked to the dog, pointed to his leg, limped around the\r\nroom, then requested the surgeon to apply some bandages around the leg,\r\nand he seemed to walk sound and well. He patted the dog on the head, who\r\nwas looking alternately at him and the surgeon, desired the surgeon to\r\npat him, and to offer him his hand to lick, and then, holding up his\r\nfinger to the dog, and gently shaking his head, quitted the room and the\r\nhouse. The dog immediately laid himself down, and submitted to a\r\nreduction of the fracture, and the bandaging of the limb, without a\r\nmotion, except once or twice licking the hand of the operator. He was\r\nquite submissive, and in a manner motionless, day after day, until, at\r\nthe expiration of a month, the limb was sound. Not a trace of the\r\nfracture was to be detected, and the purchaser, who is now living, knew\r\nnothing about it.\r\n\r\nThe employment of the Esquimaux dogs is nearly the same as those from\r\nNewfoundland, and most valuable they are to the traveller who has to\r\nfind his way over the wild and trackless regions of the north. The\r\nmanner, however, in which they are generally treated seems ill\r\ncalculated to cause any strong or lasting attachment. During their\r\nperiod of labour, they, like their brethren in Newfoundland, are fed\r\nsparingly on putrid fish, and in summer they are turned loose to shift\r\nfor themselves until the return of the severe season renders it\r\nnecessary to their masters' interest that they should again be sought\r\nfor, and once more reduced to their state of toil and slavery.\r\n\r\nThey have been known for several successive days to travel more than 60\r\nmiles. They seldom miss their road, although they may be driven over one\r\nuntrodden snowy plain, where they are occasionally unable to reach any\r\nplace of shelter. When, however, night comes, they partake with their\r\nmaster of the scanty fare which the sledge will afford, and, crowding\r\nround, keep him warm and defend him from danger. If any of them fall\r\nvictims to the hardships to which they are exposed, their master or\r\ntheir companions frequently feed on their remains, and their skins are\r\nconverted into warm and comfortable dresses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAPLAND DOG.\r\n\r\nCaptain Clarke thus describes the Lapland dog:\r\n\r\n  \"We had a valuable companion in a dog belonging to one of the boatmen.\r\n  It was of the true Lapland breed, and in all respects similar to a\r\n  wolf, excepting the tail, which was bushy and curled like those of the\r\n  Pomeranian race. This dog, swimming after the boat, if his master\r\n  merely waved his hand, would cross the lake as often as he pleased,\r\n  carrying half his body and the whole of his head and tail out of the\r\n  water. Wherever he landed, he scoured all the long grass by the side\r\n  of the lake in search of wild-fowl, and came back to us, bringing\r\n  wild-ducks in his mouth to the boat, and then, having delivered his\r\n  prey to his master, he would instantly set off again in search of\r\n  more.\" [3]\r\n\r\nBut we pass on to another and more valuable species of the dog:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHEEP-DOG.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the sheep-dog is somewhat various; but the predominant\r\nbreed is that of the intelligent and docile spaniel. Although it is now\r\nfound in every civilized country in which the sheep is cultivated, ii is\r\nnot coeval with the domestication of that animal. When the pastures were\r\nin a manner open to the first occupant, and every shepherd had a common\r\nproperty in them, it was not so necessary to restrain the wandering of\r\nthe sheep, and the voice of the shepherd was usually sufficient to\r\ncollect and to guide them. He preceded the flock, and they \"followed him\r\nwhithersoever he went.\" In process of time, however, man availed himself\r\nof the sagacity of the dog to diminish his own labour and fatigue, and\r\nthis useful servitor became the guide and defender of the flock.\r\n\r\nThe sheep-dog possesses much of the same form and character in every\r\ncountry. The muzzle is sharp, the ears are short and erect, and the\r\nanimal is covered, particularly about the neck, with thick and shaggy\r\nhair. He has usually two dew claws on each of the hind legs; not,\r\nhowever, as in the one claw of other dogs, having a jointed attachment\r\nto the limb, but merely connected by the skin and some slight cellular\r\nsubstance. These excrescences should be cut off when the dog is young.\r\nThe tail is slightly turned upwards and long, and almost as bushy as\r\nthat of a fox, even in that variety whose coat is almost smooth. He is\r\nof a black colour or black prevails, mixed with gray or brown.\r\n\r\nProfessor Grognier gives the following account of this dog as he is\r\nfound in France:\r\n\r\n  \"The shepherd's dog, the least removed from the natural type of the\r\n  dog, is of a middle size; his ears short and straight; the hair long,\r\n  principally on the tail, and of a dark colour; the tail is carried\r\n  horizontally or a little elevated. He is very indifferent to caresses.\r\n  possessed of much intelligence and activity to discharge the duties\r\n  for which he was designed. In one or other of its varieties it is\r\n  found in every part of France. Sometimes there is but a single breed,\r\n  in others there are several varieties. It lives and maintains its\r\n  proper characteristics, while other races often degenerate. Everywhere\r\n  it preserves its proper distinguishing type. It is the servant of man,\r\n  while other breeds vary with a thousand circumstances.  It has one\r\n  appropriate mission, and that it discharges in the most admirable way:\r\n  there is evidently a kind and wise design in this.\"\r\n\r\nThis account of the French sheep-dog, or of the sheep-dog everywhere, is\r\nas true as it is beautiful. One age succeeds to another, we pass from\r\none climate to another, and everything varies and changes, but the\r\nshepherd's dog is what he ever was--the guardian of our flocks. There\r\nare, however, two or more species of this dog; the one which Professor\r\nGrognier has described, and which guards and guides the sheep in the\r\nopen and level country, where wolves seldom intrude; another crossed\r\nwith the mastiff, or little removed from that dog, used in the woody and\r\nmountainous countries, their guard more than their guide. [4] In Great\r\nBritain, where he has principally to guide and not to guard the flock,\r\nhe is comparatively a small dog. He is so in the northern and open parts\r\nof the country, where activity is principally wanted; but, in the more\r\nenclosed districts, and where strength is often needed to turn an\r\nobstinate sheep, he is crossed with some larger dog, as the rough\r\nterrier, or sometimes the pointer, or now and then the bull-dog: in\r\nfact, almost any variety that has strength and stoutness may be\r\nemployed. Thus we obtain the larger sheep-dog and the drover's dog. The\r\nsagacity, forbearance, and kindness of the sheep-dog are generally\r\nretained, but from these crosses there is occasionally a degree of\r\nferocity from which the sheep often suffer.\r\n\r\nIn other countries, where the flock is exposed to the attack of the\r\nwolf, the sheep-dog is larger than the British drover's dog, and not far\r\ninferior in size to the mastiff. The strength and ferocity which qualify\r\nhim to combat with the wolf, would occasionally be injurious or fatal to\r\nthose who somewhat obstinately opposed his direction; therefore, in\r\nDenmark and in Spain, the dog is rarely employed to drive the flock. It\r\nis the office of the shepherd, to know every individual under his\r\ncharge, to, as in olden times, \"call them all by their names,\" and have\r\nalways some docile and tamed wether who will take the lead, almost as\r\nsubservient to his voice as is the dog himself, and whom the flock will\r\nimmediately follow.\r\n\r\nIn whatever country the dog is used, partly or principally to protect\r\nthe flock from the ravages of the wolf, he is as gentle as a lamb,\r\nexcept when opposed to his natural enemy; and it is only in England that\r\nthe guardian of the sheep occasionally injures and worries them, and\r\nthat many can be found bearing the mark of the tooth. This may he\r\nsomewhat excusable (although it is often carried to a barbarous extent)\r\nin the drover's dog; but it will admit of no apology in the shepherd's\r\ndog. It is the result of the idleness of the boy, or the mingled\r\nbrutality and idleness of the shepherd, who is attempting to make the\r\ndog do his own work and that of his master too. We have admired the\r\nPrussian sheep-dog in the discharge of his duty, and have seen him pick\r\nout the marked sheep, or stop and turn the flock, as cleverly as any\r\nHighland colley, but he never bit them. He is a shorter, stronger, and\r\nmore compact dog than ours. He pushes against them and forces them\r\nalong. If they rebel against this mild treatment, the shepherd is at\r\nhand to enforce obedience; and the flock is as easily and perfectly\r\nmanaged as any English or Highland one, and a great deal more so than\r\nthe majority that we have seen.\r\n\r\nMr. Trimmer, in his work on the Merinos, speaking of the Spanish flocks,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  \"There is no driving of the flock; that is a practice entirely\r\n  unknown; but the shepherd, when he wishes to remove his sheep, calls\r\n  to him a tame wether accustomed to feed from his hands. The favourite,\r\n  however distant, obeys his call, and the rest follow. One or more of\r\n  the dogs, with large collars armed with spikes, in order to protect\r\n  them from the wolves, precede the flock, others skirt it on each side,\r\n  and some bring up the rear. If a sheep be ill or lame, or lag behind\r\n  unobserved by the shepherds, they stay with it and defend it until\r\n  some one return in search of it. With us, dogs are too often used for\r\n  other and worse purposes. In open, unenclosed districts, they are\r\n  indispensable; but in others I wish them, I confess, either managed,\r\n  or encouraged less. If a sheep commits a fault in the sight of an\r\n  intemperate shepherd, or accidentally offends him, it is 'dogged'\r\n  into obedience: the signal is given, the dog obeys the mandate, and\r\n  the poor sheep flies round the field to escape from the fangs of him\r\n  who should be his protector, until it becomes half dead with fright\r\n  and exhaustion, while the trembling flock crowd together dreading the\r\n  same fate, and the churl exults in this cowardly victory over a weak\r\n  and defenceless animal.\" [5]\r\n\r\nIf the farmer will seriously calculate the number of ewes that have\r\nyeaned before their time, and of the lambs that he has lost, and the\r\naccidents that have occurred from the sheep pressing upon one another in\r\norder to escape from the dog, and if he will also take into account the\r\ncontinual disturbance of the sheep while grazing, by the approach of the\r\ndog, and the consequent interference with the cropping and the digestion\r\nof the food, he will attach more importance to the good temper of the\r\ndog and of the shepherd than he has been accustomed to do. There would\r\nbe no injustice, or rather a great deal of propriety, in inflicting a\r\nfine for every tooth-mark that could be detected. When the sheep,\r\ninstead of collecting round the dog, and placing themselves under his\r\nprotection on any sudden alarm, uniformly fly from him with terror, the\r\nfarmer may he assured there is something radically wrong in the\r\nmanagement of the flock.\r\n\r\nInstinct and education combine to fit this dog for our service. The\r\npointer will act without any great degree of instruction, and the setter\r\nwill crouch; and most certainly the sheep-dog, and especially if he has\r\nthe example of an older and expert one, will, almost without the\r\nteaching of the master, become everything that can be wished, obedient\r\nto every order, even to the slightest motion of the hand. There is a\r\nnatural predisposition for the office he has to discharge, which it\r\nrequires little trouble or skill to develop and perfect.\r\n\r\nIt is no unpleasing employment to study the degree in which the several\r\nbreeds of dogs are not only highly intelligent, but fitted by nature for\r\nthe particular duty they have to perform. The pointer, the setter, the\r\nhound, the greyhound, the terrier, the spaniel, and even the bull-dog,\r\nwere made, and almost perfected, by nature chiefly for one office alone,\r\nalthough they maybe useful in many other ways. This is well illustrated\r\nin the sheep-dog. If he be but with his master, he lies content,\r\nindifferent to every surrounding object, seemingly half asleep and half\r\nawake, rarely mingling with his kind, rarely courting, and generally\r\nshrinking from, the notice of a stranger; but the moment duty calls, his\r\nsleepy, listless eye, becomes brightened; he eagerly gazes on his\r\nmaster, inquires and comprehends all he is to do, and, springing up,\r\ngives himself to the discharge of his duty with a sagacity, and\r\nfidelity, and devotion, too rarely equalled even by man himself.\r\n\r\nMr. James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, living in his early days among the\r\nsheep and their quadruped attendants, and an accurate observer of\r\nnature, as well an exquisite poet, gives some anecdotes of the colley,\r\n(the Highland term for sheep-dog), with which the reader will not be\r\ndispleased.\r\n\r\n  \"My dog Sirrah,\" says he, in a letter to the Editor of 'Blackwood's\r\n  Edinburgh Magazine', \"was, beyond all comparison, the best dog I ever\r\n  saw. He had a somewhat surly and unsocial temper, disdaining all\r\n  flattery, and refusing to be caressed, but his attention to my\r\n  commands and interest will never again be equalled by any of the\r\n  canine race. When I first saw him, a drover was leading him with a\r\n  rope. He was both lean and hungry, and far from being a beautiful\r\n  animal; for he was almost black, and had a grim face, striped with\r\n  dark brown. I thought I perceived a sort of sullen intelligence in his\r\n  countenance, notwithstanding his dejected and forlorn appearance, and\r\n  I bought him. He was scarcely a year old, and knew so little of\r\n  herding that he had never turned a sheep in his life; but, as soon as\r\n  he discovered that it was his duty to do so, and that it obliged me, I\r\n  can never forget with what anxiety and eagerness he learned his\r\n  different evolutions; and when I once made him understand a direction,\r\n  he never forgot or mistook it.\"\r\n\r\n  On one night, a large flock of lambs that were under the Ettrick\r\n  Shepherd's care, frightened by something, scampered away in three\r\n  different directions across the hills, in spite of all that he could\r\n  do to keep them together. \"Sirrah,\" said the shepherd, \"they're a'\r\n  awa!\"\r\n\r\n  It was too dark for the dog and his master to see each other at any\r\n  considerable distance, but Sirrah understood him, and set off after\r\n  the fugitives. The night passed on, and Hogg and his assistant\r\n  traversed every neighbouring hill in anxious but fruitless search for\r\n  the lambs; but he could hear nothing of them nor of the dog, and he\r\n  was returning to his master with the doleful intelligence that he had\r\n  lost all his lambs. \"On our way home, however,\" says he, \"we\r\n  discovered a lot of lambs at the bottom of a deep ravine called the\r\n  Flesh Cleuch, and the indefatigable Sirrah standing in front of them,\r\n  looking round for some relief, but still true to his charge. We\r\n  concluded that it was one of the divisions which Sirrah had been\r\n  unable to manage, until he came to that commanding situation. But what\r\n  was our astonishment when we discovered that not one lamb of the flock\r\n  was missing! How he had got all the divisions collected in the dark,\r\n  is beyond my comprehension. The charge was left entirely to himself\r\n  from midnight until the rising sun; and, if all the shepherds in the\r\n  forest had been there to have assisted him, they could not have\r\n  effected it with greater promptitude. All that I can say is, that I\r\n  never felt so grateful to any creature under the sun us I did to my\r\n  honest Sirrah that morning.\"\r\n\r\nA shepherd, in one of his excursions over the Grampian Hills to collect\r\nhis scattered flock, took with him (as is a frequent practice, to\r\ninitiate them in their future business) one of his children about four\r\nyears old. After traversing his pastures for a while, attended by his\r\ndog, he was compelled to ascend a summit at some distance. As the ascent\r\nwas too great for the child, he left him at the bottom, with strict\r\ninjunctions not to move from the place. Scarcely, however, had he gained\r\nthe height, when one of the Scotch mists, of frequent occurrence,\r\nsuddenly came on, and almost changed the day to night. He returned to\r\nseek his child, but was unable to find him, and concluded a long and\r\nfruitless search by coming distracted to his cottage. His poor dog also\r\nwas missing in the general confusion. On the next morning by daylight he\r\nrenewed his search, but again he came back without his child. He found,\r\nhowever, that during his absence his dog had been home, and, on\r\nreceiving his allowance of food, instantly departed. For four successive\r\ndays the shepherd continued his search with the same bad fortune, the\r\ndog as readily coming for his meal and departing. Struck by this\r\nsingular circumstance, he determined to follow the dog, who departed as\r\nusual with his piece of cake. The animal led the way to a cataract at\r\nsome distance from the spot where the child had been left. It was a\r\nrugged and almost perpendicular descent which the dog took, and he\r\ndisappeared in a cave, the mouth of which was almost on a level with the\r\ntorrent. The shepherd with difficulty followed; but, on entering the\r\ncavern, what were his emotions when he beheld the infant eating the cake\r\nwhich the dog had just brought to him, while the faithful animal stood\r\nby, eyeing his young charge with the utmost complacency! From the\r\nsituation in which the child was found, it appeared that he had wandered\r\nto the brink of the precipice, and then either fallen or scrambled down,\r\nthe torrent preventing his re-ascent. The dog by means of his scent had\r\ntraced him to the spot, and afterwards prevented him from starving by\r\ngiving up a part, or, perhaps, the whole of his own daily allowance. He\r\nappears never to have quitted the child night or day, except for food,\r\nas he was seen running at full speed to and from the cottage. [6]\r\n\r\nMr. Hogg says, and very truly, that a single shepherd and his dog will\r\naccomplish more in gathering a flock of sheep from a Highland farm than\r\ntwenty shepherds could do without dogs; in fact, that without this\r\ndocile animal, the pastoral life would be a mere blank. It would require\r\nmore hands to manage a flock of sheep, gather them from the hills, force\r\nthem into houses and folds, and drive them to markets, than the profits\r\nof the whole flock would be capable of maintaining. Well may the\r\nshepherd feel an interest in his dog; he it is indeed that earns the\r\nfamily bread, of which he is himself content with the smallest morsel:\r\nalways grateful, and always ready to exert his utmost abilities in his\r\nmaster's interests. Neither hunger, fatigue, nor the worst treatment\r\nwill drive him from his side, and he will follow him through every\r\nhardship without murmur or repining. If one of them is obliged to change\r\nmasters, it is sometimes long before he will acknowledge the new owner,\r\nor condescend to work for him with the willingness that he did for his\r\nformer lord; but, if he once acknowledges him, he continues attached to\r\nhim until death. [7]\r\n\r\nWe will add another story of the colley, and proceed. It illustrates the\r\nmemory of the dog. A shepherd was employed in bringing up some mountain\r\nsheep from Westmoreland, and took with him a young sheep-dog who had\r\nnever made the journey before. From his assistant being ignorant of the\r\nground, he experienced great difficulty in having the flock stopped at\r\nthe various roads and lanes he passed in their way to the neighbourhood\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nIn the next year the same shepherd, accompanied by the same dog, brought\r\nup another flock for the gentlemen who had had the former one. On being\r\nquestioned how he had got on, he said much better than the year before,\r\nas his dog now knew the road, and had kept the sheep from going up any\r\nof the lanes or turnings that had given the shepherd so much trouble on\r\nhis former journey. The distance could not have been less than 400\r\nmiles. [8]\r\n\r\nBuffon gives an eloquent and faithful account of the sheep-dog:\r\n\r\n  \"This animal, faithful to man, will always preserve a portion of his\r\n  empire and a degree of superiority over other beings. He reigns at the\r\n  head of his flock, and makes himself better understood than the voice\r\n  of the shepherd. Safety, order, and discipline are the fruits of his\r\n  vigilance and activity. They are a people submitted to his management,\r\n  whom he conducts and protects, and against whom he never employs force\r\n  but for the preservation of good order.\"\r\n\r\n  \"If we consider that this animal, notwithstanding his ugliness and his\r\n  wild and melancholy look, is superior in instinct to all others; that\r\n  he has a decided character in which education has comparatively little\r\n  share; that he is the only animal born perfectly trained for the\r\n  service of others; that, guided by natural powers alone, he applies\r\n  himself to the care of our flocks, a duty which he executes with\r\n  singular assiduity, vigilance, and fidelity; that he conducts them\r\n  with an admirable intelligence which is a part and portion of himself;\r\n  that his sagacity astonishes at the same time that it gives repose to\r\n  his master, while it requires great time and trouble to instruct other\r\n  dogs for the purposes to which they are destined: if we reflect on\r\n  these facts we shall be confirmed in the opinion that the shepherd's\r\n  dog is the true dog of nature, the stock and model of the whole\r\n  species.\" [9]\r\n\r\n[After reading the above history of this truly valuable dog, it is\r\nalmost superfluous for us to attempt to add anything more on this head;\r\nhowever, we must pause for a few moments, to call the attention of our\r\nagriculturists and others engaged in raising sheep, to the immense\r\nadvantages to be derived from the introduction of this sagacious animal\r\nthroughout our own country.\r\n\r\nThe increased vigour that is now given for the cultivation of sheep, to\r\nsupply the necessary demands of the numerous woollen factories springing\r\nup in every quarter, renders the services of this faithful creature\r\nabsolutely indispensable, not only as a guardian of the flocks, but as a\r\nmere expedient of economy.\r\n\r\nMany portions of our country, now lying idle, particularly the\r\nmountainous ranges, are peculiarly adapted for the grazing of sheep, and\r\nwe are destined not only to supply the world with cotton, but may hope\r\nere long to add to our national wealth the other equally valuable staple\r\ncommodity, that of wool.\r\n\r\nIn the care of sheep, each dog not only supplies the place of two or\r\nthree men, but, as is seen in the foregoing pages, renders such\r\nassistance as cannot be obtained from any other source.\r\n\r\nThe shepherds of Mexico lead a life not unlike the patriarchs of old,\r\nshifting about from day to day, watching their immense flocks, attended\r\nonly by a few dogs, who have the entire control of the sheep, keeping\r\nthem from straying away, and not only defending them from the\r\nblood-thirsty wolf, but even attacking, if necessary, the skulking\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\nThese dogs of Mexico are represented as being much larger than the\r\nEnglish variety, and no doubt are the descendants of the Spanish\r\nshepherd dog, so highly prized in protecting the Merino flocks from the\r\nwolves that infest the mountainous parts of Spain, most frequented by\r\nthe herds during the summer season.\r\n\r\nThese dogs are the same breed as those engaged by the philanthropic\r\nmonks of St. Bernard in hunting up the benumbed traveller when sinking\r\nfrom exhaustion, or already overwhelmed by the sudden rushing of an\r\navalanche into some one of the mountain passes.\r\n\r\nThe original Spanish shepherd dog is a very powerful animal, and even\r\nthose of Mexico, when armed with spiked collars, are a sufficient match\r\nfor the largest wolves. Mr. Kendall mentions having met on the grand\r\nprairie with a flock of sheep numbering seventeen thousand, which\r\nimmense herd was guarded by a very few men, assisted by a large number\r\nof noble dogs, which appeared gifted with the faculty of keeping them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n  \"There was no running about, no barking or biting in their system of\r\n  tactics; on the contrary, they were continually walking up and down,\r\n  like faithful sentinels, on the outer side of the flock, and should\r\n  any sheep chance to stray from his fellows, the dog on duty at that\r\n  particular post would walk gently up, take him carefully by the ear,\r\n  and lead him back to the fold. Not the least fear did the sheep\r\n  manifest at the approach of these dogs, and there was no occasion for\r\n  it.\"\r\n  Vol. I. p. 268.\r\n\r\nThis account coincides with the remarks of Mr. Trinner upon this dog in\r\nold Spain; and Mr. Skinner very justly remarks, that the Mexican\r\nsheep-dog has not his equal in any part of the world, except, perhaps,\r\nin his native country, and that the Scotch or English dog sinks into\r\ninsignificance when compared with him.\r\n\r\nA flock of a thousand sheep in Spain requires the attendance of two men\r\nand an equal number of dogs, who never for a moment quit their charge,\r\nwatching them without intermission day and night. The great inferiority\r\nof the English dogs, may be attributed, perhaps, to their want of care\r\nin training and bringing up, which is considered the most essential, and\r\nactually the foundation of all their future usefulness with the\r\nMexicans. The pups when first born, are taken from the bitch, and put to\r\na sucking ewe, already deprived of her own lamb. For several days the\r\newe is confined with the pups in the shepherd's hut, and either from\r\nforce, or an instinctive desire to be relieved of the contents of the\r\nudder, she soon allows the little strangers to suck, and in the course\r\nof a few days more, becomes quite reconciled to the change, and exhibits\r\na great degree of affection for her foster children, who, knowing no\r\nother parentage, becomes thus early engrafted into the general\r\ncommunity, and returns their early kindness by every mark of affection\r\nand fidelity hereafter; never being willing for a moment to quit their\r\nsociety, but remains with them night and day, expressing a peculiar\r\nattachment to this particular flock, and seeming able to distinguish\r\neach member of it from all other intruders.\r\n\r\nIn the third volume of the 'American Agriculturist' will be found an\r\ninteresting article connected with this subject, and from which we might\r\nextract much useful information, if our limits would allow of its\r\ninsertion in the present volume.\r\n\r\nMr. Skinner states, that in 1832 he had two of these dogs, a male and\r\nfemale, both trained, but unfortunately lost the latter before obtaining\r\nany pups from her; he also remarks, that they can be imported via Havana\r\nand Santander, at an expense of not less than $70 or $80. We see no\r\nreason why the same dogs might not be obtained at a much less cost by\r\nthe Santa Fé traders, who, no doubt, would be glad to bring them into\r\nthe country as companions de voyages, provided there was any demand for\r\nthem.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DROVER'S DOG\r\n\r\nbears considerable resemblance to the sheep-dog, and has usually the\r\nsame prevailing black or brown colour. He possesses all the docility of\r\nthe sheep-dog, with more courage, and sometimes a degree of ferocity,\r\nexercised without just cause upon his charge, while he is in his turn\r\ncruelly used by a brutal master.\r\n\r\nThere is a valuable cross between the colley and the drover's dog in\r\nWestmoreland, and a larger and stronger breed is cultivated in\r\nLincolnshire; indeed it is necessary there, where oxen as well as sheep\r\nare usually consigned to the dog's care. A good drover's dog is worth a\r\nconsiderable sum; but the breed is too frequently and injudiciously\r\ncrossed at the fancy of the owner. Some drovers' dogs are as much like\r\nsetters, lurchers, and hounds, as they are to the original breed.\r\n\r\nStories are told of the docility and sagacity of the drover's dog even\r\nmore surprising than any that are related of the sheep-dog. The Ettrick\r\nShepherd says, that a Mr. Steel, butcher in Peebles, had such implicit\r\ndependence on the attention of his dog to his orders, that whenever he\r\nput a lot of sheep before her, he took a pride in leaving them entirely\r\nto her, and either remained to take a glass with the farmer of whom he\r\nhad made the purchase, or travelled another road to look after bargains\r\nor business. At one time, however, he chanced to commit a drove to her\r\ncharge, at a place called Willenslee, without attending to her\r\ncondition, which he certainly ought to have done. This farm is about\r\nfive miles from Peebles, over wild hills, and there is no regularly\r\ndefined path to it. Whether Mr. Steel chose another road is uncertain;\r\nbut, on coming home late in the evening, he was surprised to hear that\r\nhis faithful animal had not made her appearance with her flock. He and\r\nhis son instantly prepared to set out by different paths in search of\r\nher; but, on going into the street, there was she with the flock, and\r\nnot one of the sheep missing; she, however, was carrying a young pup in\r\nher mouth. She had been taken in travail on those hills; and how the\r\npoor beast had contrived to manage the sheep in her state of suffering\r\nis beyond human calculation, for her road lay through sheep-pastures the\r\nwhole way. Her master's heart smote him when he saw what she had\r\nsuffered and effected; but she was nothing daunted; and, having\r\ndeposited her young one in a place of safety, she again set out at full\r\nspeed to the hills, and brought another and another little one, until\r\nshe had removed her whole litter one by one; the last, however, was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine relates as extraordinary an instance of intelligence, but not\r\nmingled, like the former, with natural affection. A butcher and\r\ncattle-dealer, who resided about nine miles from Alston, in Cumberland,\r\nbought a dog of a drover. The butcher was accustomed to purchase sheep\r\nand kine in the vicinity, which, when fattened, he drove to Alston\r\nmarket and sold. In these excursions he was frequently astonished at the\r\npeculiar sagacity of his dog, and at the more than common readiness and\r\ndexterity with which he managed the cattle; until at length he troubled\r\nhimself very little about the matter, but, riding carelessly along, used\r\nto amuse himself with observing how adroitly the dog acquitted himself\r\nof his charge. At length, so convinced was he of his sagacity, as well\r\nas fidelity, that he laid a wager that he would intrust the dog with a\r\nnumber of sheep and oxen, and let him drive them alone and unattended to\r\nAlston market. It was stipulated that no one should be within sight or\r\nhearing who had the least control over the dog, nor was any spectator to\r\ninterfere. This extraordinary animal, however, proceeded with his\r\nbusiness in the most steady and dexterous manner; and, although he had\r\nfrequently to drive his charge through other herds that were grazing, he\r\ndid not lose one; but, conducting them to the very yard to which he was\r\nused to drive them when with his master, he significantly delivered them\r\nup to the person appointed to receive them by barking at his door. When\r\nthe path which he travelled lay through grounds in which others were\r\ngrazing, he would run forward, stop his own drove, and then, chasing the\r\nothers away, collect his scattered charge, and proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN OR POMERANIAN WOLF-DOG.\r\n\r\nThe wolf-dog is no longer a native of Great Britain, because his\r\nservices are not required there, but he is useful in various parts of\r\nthe Continent, in the protection of the sheep from the attacks of the\r\nwolf. A pair of these dogs was brought to the Zoological Society of\r\nLondon in 1833, and there long remained, an ornament to the Gardens.\r\nThey appeared to possess a considerable degree of strength, but to be\r\ntoo gentle to contend with so powerful and ferocious an animal as the\r\nwolf. They were mostly covered with white or gray, or occasionally black\r\nhair, short on the head, ears and feet, but long and silky on the body\r\nand tail. The forehead is elevated, and the muzzle lengthened and\r\nclothed with short hair. The attachment of this dog to his master and\r\nthe flock is very great, and he has not lost a particle of his sagacity,\r\nbut, where wolves are common, is still used as a sheep-dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUR\r\n\r\nis the sheep-dog crossed with the terrier. He has long and somewhat\r\ndeservedly obtained a very bad name, as a bully and a coward; and\r\ncertainly his habit of barking at everything that passes, and flying at\r\nthe heels of the horse, renders him often a very dangerous nuisance: he\r\nis, however, in a manner necessary to the cottager; he is a faithful\r\ndefender of his humble dwelling; no bribe can seduce him from his duty;\r\nand he is likewise a useful and an effectual guard over the clothes and\r\nscanty provisions of the labourer, who may be working in some distant\r\npart of the field. All day long he will lie upon his master's clothes\r\nseemingly asleep, but giving immediate warning of the approach of a\r\nsupposed marauder.  He has a propensity, when at home, to fly at every\r\nhorse and every strange dog; and of young game of every kind there is\r\nnot a more ruthless destroyer than the village cur.\r\n\r\nMr. Hogg draws the following curious parallel between the sheep-dog and\r\nthe cur:\r\n\r\n  \"An exceedingly good sheep-dog attends to nothing but the particular\r\n  branch of business to which he is bred. His whole capacity is exerted\r\n  and exhausted in it; and he is of little avail in miscellaneous\r\n  matters; whereas a very indifferent cur bred about the house, and\r\n  accustomed to assist in everything will often put the more noble breed\r\n  to disgrace in these little services. If some one calls out that the\r\n  cows are in the corn or the hens in the garden, the house colley needs\r\n  no other hint, but runs and turns them out. The shepherd's dog knows\r\n  not what is astir, and, if he is called out in a hurry for such work,\r\n  all that he will do is to run to the hill, or rear himself on his\r\n  haunches to see that no sheep are running away. A well-bred sheep-dog,\r\n  if coming hungry from the hills, and getting into a milk-house, would\r\n  likely think of nothing else than filling his belly with the cream.\r\n  Not so his initiated brother: he is bred at home to far higher\r\n  principles of honour. I have known such lie night and day among from\r\n  ten to twenty pails full of milk, and never once break the cream of\r\n  one of them with the tip of his tongue, nor would he suffer cat, rat,\r\n  or any other creature to touch it. While, therefore, the cur is a\r\n  nuisance, he is very useful in his way, and we would further plead for\r\n  him, that he possesses a great deal of the sagacity and all the\r\n  fidelity of the choicest breed of dogs.\"\r\n\r\nThe dog who, according to the well-known and authentic story, watched\r\nthe remains of his master for two years in the churchyard of St.\r\nOlave's, in Southwark, was a cur.\r\n\r\nThe following story is strictly authentic:\r\n\r\n  \"Not long ago a young man, an acquaintance of the coachman, was\r\n  walking, as he had often done, in Lord Fife's stables at Banff. Taking\r\n  an opportunity, when the servants were not regarding him, he put a\r\n  bridle into his pocket. A Highland cur that was generally about the\r\n  stables saw him, and immediately began to bark at him, and when he got\r\n  to the stable-door would not let him pass, but bit him by the leg in\r\n  order to prevent him. As the servants had never seen the dog act thus\r\n  before, and the same young man had been often with them, they could\r\n  not imagine what could be the reason of the dog's conduct. However,\r\n  when they saw the end of a valuable bridle peeping out of the young\r\n  man's pocket, they were able to account for it, and, on his giving it\r\n  up, the dog left the stable-door, where he had stood, and allowed him\r\n  to pass.\" [10]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LURCHER.\r\n\r\nThis dog was originally a cross between the greyhound and the shepherd's\r\ndog, retaining all the speed and fondness for the chase belonging to the\r\none, and the superior intelligence and readiness for any kind of work\r\nwhich the latter possessed. This breed has been crossed again with the\r\nspaniel, combining the disposition to quest for game which distinguishes\r\nthe spaniel with the muteness and swiftness of the greyhound. Sometimes\r\nthe greyhound is crossed with the hound. Whatever be the cross, the\r\ngreyhound must predominate; but his form, although still to be traced,\r\nhas lost all its beauty.\r\n\r\nThe lurcher is a dog seldom found in the possession of the honourable\r\nsportsman. The farmer may breed him for his general usefulness, for\r\ndriving his cattle, and guarding his premises, and occasionally coursing\r\nthe hare; but other dogs will answer the former purposes much better,\r\nwhile the latter qualification may render him suspected by his landlord,\r\nand sometimes be productive of serious injury. In a rabbit-warren this\r\ndog is peculiarly destructive. His scent enables him to follow them\r\nsilently and swiftly. He darts unexpectedly upon them, and, being\r\ntrained to bring his prey to his master, one of these dogs will often in\r\none night supply the poacher with rabbits and other game worth more\r\nmoney than he could earn by two days' hard labour.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Faull, of Helstone, in Cornwall, lost no fewer than fifteen fine\r\nsheep, and some of them store sheep, killed by lurchers in January,\r\n1824. [11]\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the different species of dog belonging to the second\r\ndivision of Cuvier, which are classed under the name of Hound; and,\r\nfirst we take\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAGLE.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this diminutive hound is somewhat obscure. There is\r\nevidently much of the harrier and of the old southern, connected with a\r\nconsiderable decrease of size and speed, the possession of an\r\nexceedingly musical voice, and very great power of scent. Beagles are\r\nrarely more than ten or twelve inches in height, and were generally so\r\nnearly of the same size and power of speed, that it was commonly said\r\nthey might be covered with a sheet. This close running is, however,\r\nconsidered as a mark of excellence in hounds of every kind.\r\n\r\nThere are many pleasurable recollections of the period when \"the good\r\nold English gentleman\" used to keep his pack of beagles or little\r\nharriers, slow but sure, occasionally carried to the field in a pair of\r\npanniers on a horse's back; often an object of ridicule at an early\r\nperiod of the chase, but rarely failing to accomplish their object ere\r\nthe day closed, \"the puzzling pack unravelling wile by wile, maze within\r\nmaze.\" It was often the work of two or three hours to accomplish this;\r\nbut is was seldom, in spite of her speed, her shifts, and her doublings,\r\nthat the hare did not fall a victim to her pursuers.\r\n\r\nThe slowness of their pace gradually caused them to be almost totally\r\ndiscontinued, until very lately, and especially in the royal park at\r\nWindsor, they have been again introduced. Generally speaking, they have\r\nall the strength and endurance which is necessary to ensure their\r\nkilling their game, and are much fleeter than their diminutive size\r\nwould indicate. Formerly, considerable fancy and even judgment used to\r\nbe exercised in the breeding of these dogs. They were curiously\r\ndistinguished by the names of \"deep-flewed,\" or \"shallow-flewed,\" in\r\nproportion as they had the depending upper lip of the southern, or the\r\nsharper muzzle and more contracted lip of the northern dogs. The\r\nshallow-flewed were the swiftest, and the deep-flewed the stoutest and\r\nthe surest, and their music the most pleasant. The wire-haired beagle\r\nwas considered as the stouter and better dog.\r\n\r\nThe form of the head in beagles has been much misunderstood. They have,\r\nor should have, large heads, decidedly round, and thick rather than\r\nlong; there will then be room for the expansion of the nasal membrane,\r\nthat of smell, and for the reverberation of the sound, so peculiarly\r\npleasant in this dog.\r\n\r\nThe beagle runs very low to the ground, and therefore has a stronger\r\nimpression of the scent than taller dogs. This is especially the case\r\nwhen the scent is more than usually low.\r\n\r\nAmong the advocates for beagles, several years ago, was Colonel Hardy.\r\nHe used to send his dogs in panniers, and they had a little barn for\r\ntheir kennel. The door was one night broken open, and every hound,\r\npanniers and all, stolen. The thief was never discovered, not even\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nThe use of beagles was soon afterwards nearly abandoned by the\r\nintroduction of the harrier, and by his yielding in his turn to the\r\nfox-hound; but the beagles of Colonel Thornton and Colonel Molyneux will\r\nnot be soon forgotten. [12]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a practice which fair sportsmen will never resort\r\nto--the use of a beagle to start a hare in order to be run down by a\r\nbrace of greyhounds, or perhaps by a lurcher. The hare is not fairly\r\nmatched in this way of proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARRIER\r\n\r\noccupies an intermediate station between the beagle and the fox-hound.\r\nIt is the fox-hound bred down to a diminished size, and suited to the\r\nanimal he is to pursue. He retains, or did for a while retain, the long\r\nbody, deep chest, large bones, somewhat heavy head, sweeping ears, and\r\nmellow voice, which the sportsman of old so enthusiastically described,\r\nwith the certainty of killing, and the pleasing prolongation of the\r\nchase. With this the farmer used to be content: it did not require\r\nexpensive cattle, was not attended with much hazard of neck, and did not\r\ntake him far from home.\r\n\r\nAlmost every country squire used in former days to keep his little pack\r\nof harriers or beagles. He was mounted on his stout cob-horse, that\r\nserved him alike for the road and the chase; and his huntsman probably\r\nhad a still smaller and rougher beast, or sometimes ran afoot. He could\r\nthen follow the sport, almost without going off his own land, and the\r\nfarmer's boys, knowing the country and the usual doublings of the hare,\r\ncould see the greater part of the chase, and were almost able to keep up\r\nwith the hounds, so that they were rarely absent at the death: indeed,\r\nthey saw and enjoyed far more of it than the fox-hunter or the\r\nstag-hunter now does, mounted on his fleetest horse.\r\n\r\nThe harrier was not more than 18 or 19 inches high. He was crossed with\r\nthe fox-hound if he was getting too diminutive, or with the beagle if he\r\nwas becoming too tall.\r\n\r\nThe principal objects the sportsman endeavoured to accomplish were to\r\npreserve stoutness, scent, and musical voice, with speed to follow the\r\nhare sufficiently close, yet not enough to run her down too quickly, or\r\nwithout some of those perplexities, and faults, and uncertainties which\r\ngive the principal zest to the chase.\r\n\r\nThe character and speed of the hound much depend on the nature of the\r\ncountry. The smaller harrier will best suit a deeply enclosed country;\r\nbut where there is little cover, and less doubling greater size and\r\nfleetness are requisite. The harrier, nevertheless, let him be as tall\r\nand as speedy as he may, should never he used for the fox; but every dog\r\nshould be strictly confined to his own game.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckford, in his 'Thoughts upon Hunting', gives an account,\r\nunrivalled, of the chase of the hare and fox. Many sporting writers have\r\nendeavoured to tread in his steps; but they have failed in giving that\r\ngraphic account of the pleasures of the field which Mr. Beckford's essay\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nHe says that the sportsman should never have more than 20 couple in the\r\nfield, because it would he exceedingly difficult to get a greater number\r\nto run together, and a pack of harriers cannot be complete if they do\r\nnot. A hound that runs too fast for the rest, or that lags behind them,\r\nshould be immediately discarded. His hounds were between the large\r\nslow-hunting harrier and the fox-beagle. He endeavoured to get as much\r\nbone and strength in as little compass as possible. He acknowledges that\r\nthis was a difficult undertaking; but he had, at last, the pleasure to\r\nsee them handsome, small, yet bony, running well together, and fast\r\nenough, with all the alacrity that could be desired, and hunting the\r\ncoldest scent.\r\n\r\nHe anticipates the present improvement of the chase when he lays it down\r\nas a rule never to be departed from, that hounds of every kind should be\r\nkept to their own game. They should have one scent, and one style of\r\nhunting. Harriers will run a fox in so different a style from the\r\npursuit of a hare, that they will not readily, and often will not at\r\nall, return to their proper work. The difference in the scent, and the\r\neagerness of pursuit, and the noise that accompanies fox-hunting, all\r\ncontribute to spoil a harrier.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckford pleasingly expresses a sportsman's consideration for the\r\npoor animal which he is hunting to death.\r\n\r\n  \"A hare,\" he says, \"is a timorous little animal that we cannot help\r\n  feeling some compassion for at the time that we are pursuing her\r\n  destruction. We should give scope to all her little tricks, nor kill\r\n  her foully nor overmatched. Instinct instructs her to make a good\r\n  defence when not unfairly treated, and I will venture to say that, as\r\n  far as her own safety is concerned, she has more cunning than the fox,\r\n  and makes shifts to save her life far beyond all his artifice.\" [13]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOX HOUND\r\n\r\nis of a middle size, between the harrier and the stag-hound; it is the\r\nold English hound, sufficiently crossed with the greyhound to give him\r\nlightness and speed without impairing his scent; and he has now been\r\nbred to a degree of speed sufficient to satisfy the man who holds his\r\nneck at the least possible price, and with which few, except\r\nthorough-bred horses, and not all of them, can live to the end of the\r\nchase. The fox-hound is lighter, or as it is now called, more highly\r\nbred, or he retains a greater portion of his original size and\r\nheaviness, according to the nature of the country and the fancy of the\r\nmaster of the pack: therefore it is difficult to give an accurate\r\ndescription of the best variety of this dog; but there are guiding\r\npoints which can never be forgotten without serious injury.\r\n\r\nHe derives from the greyhound a head somewhat smaller and longer in\r\nproportion to his size than either the stag-hound or the harrier. But\r\nconsiderable caution is requisite here. The beauty of the head and face,\r\nalthough usually accompanied by speed, must never be sacrificed to\r\nstoutness and power of scent. The object of the sportsman is to\r\namalgamate them, or rather to possess them all in the greatest possible\r\ndegree. This will generally be brought to a great degree of perfection\r\nif the sportsman regards the general excellence of the dog rather than\r\nthe perfection of any particular point. The ears should not,\r\ncomparatively speaking, be so large as those of the stag-hound or the\r\nharrier; but the neck should be longer and lighter, the chest deep and\r\ncapacious, the fore legs straight as arrows, and the hind ones well bent\r\nat the hock.\r\n\r\nSome extraordinary accounts have been given of the speed of the\r\nfox-hound. A match that was run over the Beacon Course at Newmarket is\r\nthe best illustration of his fleetness. The distance is 4 miles 1\r\nfurlong and 132 yards. The winning dog performed it in 8 minutes and a\r\nfew seconds; but of the sixty horses that started with the hounds, only\r\ntwelve were able to run in with them. Flying Childers had run the same\r\ncourse in 7 minutes and 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n  \"The size, or, as we should rather say, the height of a fox-hound, is\r\n  a point on which there has been much difference of opinion. Mr.\r\n  Chule's pack was three inches below the standard of Mr. Villebois',\r\n  and four inches below that of Mr. Warde's. The advocates of the former\r\n  assert, that they get better across a deep and strongly fenced\r\n  country, while the admirers of the latter insist on their being better\r\n  climbers of hills and more active in cover. As to uniformity in size,\r\n  it is by no means essential to the well-doing of hounds in the field,\r\n  and has been disregarded by some of our best sportsmen: Mr. Meynell\r\n  never drafted a good hound on account of his being over or under\r\n  sized. The proper standard of height in fox-hounds is from 21 to 22\r\n  inches for bitches, and from 23 to 24 for dog-hounds. Mr. Warde's\r\n  bitches, the best of the kind that our country contained, were rather\r\n  more than 23 inches. A few of his dogs were 25 inches high. The amount\r\n  of hounds annually bred will depend upon the strength of the kennel.\r\n  From sixty to eighty couples is the complement for a four days a-week\r\n  pack, which will require the breeding of a hundred couples of puppies\r\n  every year, allowing for accidents and distemper.\" [14]\r\n\r\nNimrod very properly observes, that\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Beckford has omitted a point much thought of by the modern\r\n  sportsmen, namely, 'the back-ribs', which should also be deep, as in a\r\n  strong-bodied horse, of which we say, when so formed, that he has a\r\n  good 'spur place;' a point highly esteemed in him. Nor is he\r\n  sufficiently descriptive of the hinder legs of the hound; for there is\r\n  a length of thigh discernible in first-rate hounds which, like the\r\n  well-let-down hock of the horse, gives them much superiority of speed,\r\n  and is also a great security against their laming themselves in\r\n  leaping fences, which they are more apt to do when they become blown\r\n  and consequently weak. The fore legs, 'straight as arrows,' is an\r\n  admirable illustration of perfection in those parts by Beckford; for,\r\n  as in a bow or bandy legged man, nothing is so disfiguring to a hound\r\n  as having his elbows projecting, and which is likewise a great check\r\n  to speed.\" [15]\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel gives a curious account of the prejudices of sportsmen on the\r\nsubject of colour. The white dogs were curious hunters, and had a\r\ncapital scent; the black, with some white spots, were obedient, good\r\nhunters, and with good constitutions; the gray-coloured had no very\r\nacute scent, but were obstinate, and indefatigable in their quest; the\r\nyellow dogs were impatient and obstinate, and taught with difficulty.\r\n[16]\r\n\r\nThe dog exhibits no criteria of age after the first two years. That\r\nperiod having elapsed, the whiteness and evenness of the teeth soon pass\r\naway, and the 'old' dog can scarcely be mistaken. Nimrod scarcely speaks\r\ntoo positively when he says that an old hound cannot be mistaken, if\r\nonly looked in the face. At all events, few are found in a kennel after\r\nthe eighth year, and very few after the ninth.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckford advises the sportsman carefully to consider the size,\r\nshape, colour, constitution, and natural disposition of the dog from\r\nwhich he breeds, and also the fineness of the nose, the evident strength\r\nof the limb, and the good temper and devotion to his master which he\r\ndisplays. The faults or imperfections in one breed may be rectified in\r\nanother; and, if this is properly attended to, there is no reason why\r\nimprovements may not continually be made.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the sexes in the kennel and in the field is one of the\r\nlatest innovations in the hunting world, and generally considered to be\r\na good one. The eye is pleased to see a pack of hounds, nearly or quite\r\nof a size. The character of the animal is more uniformly displayed when\r\nconfined to one sex. In consequence of the separation of the two, the\r\ndogs are less inclined to quarrel; and the bitches are more at their\r\nease than when undergoing the importunate solicitations of the male. As\r\nto their performances in the field, opinions vary, and each sex has its\r\nadvocates. The bitch, with a good fox before her, is decidedly more\r\noff-hand at her work; but she is less patient, and sometimes overruns\r\nthe scent. Sir Bellingharn Graham has been frequently heard to say, that\r\nif his kennels would have afforded it, he would never have taken a\r\ndog-hound into the field. That in the canine race the female has more of\r\nelegance and symmetry of form, consequently more of speed, than the\r\nmale, is evident to a common observer; but there is nothing to lead to\r\nthe conclusion that, in the natural endowments of the senses, any\r\nsuperiority exists. [17]\r\n\r\nThe bitch should not be allowed to engage in any long and severe chase\r\nafter she has been lined. She should be kept as quiet as may be\r\npracticable, and well but not too abundantly fed; each having a kennel\r\nor place of retreat for herself. She should be carefully watched, and\r\nespecially when the ninth week approaches. The huntsman and the keeper\r\nwithout any apparent or unnecessary intrusion, should be on the alert.\r\n\r\nThe time of pupping having arrived, as little noise or disturbance\r\nshould be made as possible; but a keeper should be always at hand in\r\ncase of abortion or difficult parturition. Should there be a probability\r\nof either of these occurring, he should not be in a hurry; for, as much\r\nshould be left to nature as can, without evident danger, be done, and\r\nthe keeper should rarely intrude unless his assistance is indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe pupping being accomplished, the mother should be carefully attended\r\nto. She should be liberally fed, and particularly should have her share\r\nof animal food, and an increased quantity of milk.\r\n\r\nThe bitch should not have whelps until she has hunted two seasons; for,\r\nbefore that time it will be scarcely possible to ascertain her\r\nexcellences or defects. If there are any considerable faults, she should\r\nbe immediately rejected.\r\n\r\nWhen the time approaches for her to produce her puppies, she should be\r\nallowed a certain degree of liberty, and should choose her couch and run\r\nabout a little more than usual; but, when the young ones are born, the\r\nless they are handled the better. The constitution and appearance of the\r\nmother will indicate how many should be kept. If two litters are born at\r\nor about the same time, or within two or three days of each other, we\r\nmay interchange one or two of the whelps of each of them, and perhaps\r\nincrease the value of both.\r\n\r\nWhen the whelps are able to crawl to a certain distance, it will be time\r\nto mark them, according to their respective litters, some on the ear and\r\nothers on the lip. The dew-claws should be removed, and, usually, a\r\nsmall tip from the tail. Their names also should be recorded.\r\n\r\nThe whelps will begin to lap very soon after they can look about them,\r\nand should remain with the mother until they are fully able to take care\r\nof themselves. They may then be prepared to go to quarters.\r\n\r\nTwo or three doses of physic should be given to the mother, with\r\nintervals of four or five days between each: this will prepare her to\r\nreturn to the kennel.\r\n\r\nThere is often considerable difficulty in disposing of the whelps until\r\nthey get old and stout enough to be brought into the kennel. They are\r\nmostly sent to some of the neighbouring cottages, in order to be taken\r\ncare of; but they are often neglected and half starved there. In\r\nconsequence of this, distemper soon appears, and many of them are lost.\r\n\r\nWhelps 'walked', or taken care of at butchers' houses, soon grow to a\r\nconsiderable size; but they are apt to be heavy-shouldered and throaty,\r\nand perhaps otherwise deformed. There is some doubt whether it might not\r\nbe better for the sportsman to take the management of them himself, and\r\nto have a kennel built purposely for them. It may, perhaps, be feared\r\nthat the distemper will get among them: they would, however, be well\r\nfed, and far more comfortable than they now are; and, as to the\r\ndistemper, it is a disease that they must have some time or other.\r\n\r\nFrom twenty to thirty couples are quite as many as can be easily\r\nmanaged; and the principal consideration is, whether they are steady,\r\nand as nearly as possible equal of speed. When the packs are very large,\r\nthe hounds are seldom sufficiently hunted to be good. Few persons choose\r\nto hunt every day, or, if they did, it is not likely that the weather\r\nwould permit them. The sportsman would, therefore, be compelled to take\r\nan inconvenient number into the field, and too many must be left behind.\r\nIn the first place, too many hounds in the field would frequently spoil\r\nthe sport; and, on the other hand, the hounds that remained would get\r\nout of wind, or become riotous, or both. Hounds, to be useful and good,\r\nshould be constantly hunted; but a great fault in many packs is their\r\nhaving too many old dogs among them.\r\n\r\nYoung hounds, when first taken to the kennel, should be kept separate\r\nfrom the rest of the pack, otherwise there will be frequent and\r\ndangerous quarrels. When these do occur, the feeder hears, and\r\nsometimes, but not so frequently as he ought, endeavours to discover the\r\ncause of the disturbance, and visits the culprits with deserved\r\npunishment; too often, however, he does not give himself time for this,\r\nbut rushes among them, and flogs every hound that he can get at, guilty\r\nor not guilty. This is a shameful method of procedure. It is the cause\r\nof much undeserved punishment: it spoils the temper of the dog, and\r\nmakes him careless and indifferent as long as he lives.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckford very properly remarks, that\r\n\r\n  \"Young hounds are, and must be awkward at first, and should be taken\r\n  out, a few at a time, with couples not too loose. They are thus\r\n  accustomed to the usual occurrences of the road, and this is most\r\n  easily accomplished when a young and an old dog are coupled together.\"\r\n\r\nA sheep-field is the next object, and the young hound, properly watched,\r\nsoon becomes reconciled, and goes quietly along with the companion of\r\nthe preceding day. A few days afterwards the dogs are uncoupled in the\r\nfield, and perhaps, at first, are not a little disposed to attack the\r\nsheep; but the cry of \"Ware sheep!\" in a stern tone of voice, arrests\r\nthem, and often, without the aid of the whip; it being taken as a\r\nprinciple that this instrument should be used as seldom as possible. If,\r\nindeed, the dog is self-willed, the whip must be had recourse to, and\r\nperhaps with some severity; for, if he is once suffered to taste the\r\nblood of the sheep, it may be difficult to restrain him afterwards. A\r\nnobleman was told that it was possible to break his dogs of the habit of\r\nattacking his sheep, by introducing a large and fearless ram among them;\r\none was accordingly procured and turned into the kennel. The men with\r\ntheir whips and voices, and the ram with his horns, soon threw the whole\r\nkennel into confusion. The hounds and the ram were left together.\r\nMeeting a friend soon afterwards, \"Come,\" said he, \"to the kennel, and\r\nsee what rare sport the ram is making among the hounds.\" His friend\r\nasked whether he was not afraid that some of them might be spoiled.\r\n\"No,\" said he; \"they deserve it, and let them suffer.\" They proceeded to\r\nthe kennel; all was quiet. The kennel-door was thrown open, and the\r\nremains of the ram were found scattered about: the hounds, having filled\r\ntheir bellies, had retired to rest.\r\n\r\nThe time of entering young hounds must vary in different countries. In a\r\ncorn country, it should not be until the wheat is carried; in grass\r\ncountries, somewhat sooner; and, in woodlands, as soon as we please.\r\nFrequent hallooing may be of use with young hounds; it makes them more\r\neager; but, generally speaking, there is a time when it may be of use, a\r\ntime when it does harm, and a time when it is perfectly indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks of Mr. Beckford are worthy of their author:\r\n\r\n  \"Hounds at their first entering cannot be encouraged too much. When\r\n  they begin to know what is right, it will be soon enough to chastise\r\n  them for doing wrong, and, in such case, one rather severe beating\r\n  will save a great deal of trouble. The voice should be used as well as\r\n  the whip; and the smack of the whip will often be of as much avail as\r\n  the lash to him who has felt it.\"\r\n\r\nFlogging hounds in the kennel, the frequent practice of too many\r\nhuntsmen, should be held in utter abhorrence, and, if carried to a\r\nconsiderable excess, is a disgrace to humanity. Generally speaking, none\r\nbut the sportsman can form an adequate conception of the perfect\r\nobedience of the hound both in the kennel and the field. At\r\nfeeding-time, each dog, although hungry enough, will go through the gate\r\nin the precise order in which he is called by the feeder; and, in a\r\nwell-broken pack, to chop at, or to follow a hare, or to give tongue on\r\na false scent, or even to break cover alone, although the fox is in\r\nview, are faults that are rarely witnessed.\r\n\r\nLet not this obedience, however, be purchased by the infliction of a\r\ndegree of cruelty that disgraces both the master and the menial. A young\r\nfox-hound may, possibly, mistake the scent of a hare for that of a fox,\r\nand give tongue. In too many hunts he will be unmercifully flogged for\r\nthis, and some have almost died under the lash. Mercy is a word totally\r\nunknown to a great proportion of whippers-in, and even to many who call\r\nthemselves gentlemen. There can be no occasion or excuse for barbarity:\r\na little trouble, and moderate punishment, and the example of his\r\nfellows, will gradually teach the wildest hound his duty.\r\n\r\nThat the huntsman, and not the hound, may occasionally be in fault, the\r\nfollowing anecdote will furnish sufficient proof. In drawing a strong\r\ncover, a young bitch gave tongue very freely, while none of the other\r\nhounds challenged. The whipper-in railed to no purpose; the huntsman\r\ninsisted that she was wrong, and the whip was applied with great\r\nseverity. In doing this, the lash accidentally struck one of her eyes\r\nout of its socket.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the dreadful pain that must have ensued, she again took\r\nup the scent, and proved herself right; for the fox had stolen away, and\r\nshe had broken cover after him, unheeded and alone. After much delay and\r\ncold hunting, the pack hit off the same scent.\r\n\r\nAt some distance a farmer informed the sportsmen, that they were a long\r\nway behind the fox, for he had seen a single hound, very bloody about\r\nthe head, running breast-high, so that there was but little chance of\r\ntheir getting up with her. The pack, from her coming to a check, did at\r\nlast overtake her.\r\n\r\nThe same bitch once more hit off the scent, and the fox was killed,\r\nafter a long and severe run. The eye of the poor animal, that had hung\r\npendent through the chase, was then taken off with a pair of scissors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON.\r\n\r\nDuring the beginning of autumn, the hounds should be daily exercised\r\nwhen the weather will permit. They should often be called over in the\r\nkennel to habituate them to their names, and walked out among the sheep\r\nand deer, in order that they may he accustomed perfectly to disregard\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA few stout hounds being added to the young ones, some young foxes may\r\noccasionally be turned out. If they hunt improper game, they must be\r\nsternly checked. Implicit obedience is required until they have been\r\nsufficiently taught as to the game which they are to pursue. No\r\nobstinate deviation from it must ever be pardoned. The hounds should be,\r\nas much as possible, taken out into the country which they are\r\nafterwards to hunt, and some young foxes are probably turned out for\r\nthem to pursue. At length they are suffered to hunt their game in\r\nthorough earnest, and to taste of its blood.\r\n\r\nAfter this they are sent to more distant covers, and more old hounds are\r\nadded, and so they continue until they are taken into the pack, which\r\nusually happens in September. The young hounds continue to be added, two\r\nor three couple at a time, until all have hunted. They are then divided\r\ninto two packs, to be taken out alternate days. Properly speaking, the\r\nsport cannot be said to begin until October, but the two preceding\r\nmonths are important and busy ones. [18]\r\n\r\n  \"It would appear, then,\" says Nimrod, \"that the breeding of a pack of\r\n  fox-hounds, bordering on perfection, is a task of no ordinary\r\n  difficulty. The best proof of it is to be found in the few sportsmen\r\n  that have succeeded in it. Not only is every good quality obtained if\r\n  possible, but every imperfection or fault is avoided. The highest\r\n  virtue in a fox-hound is his being true to the line his game has gone,\r\n  and a stout runner at the end of the chase. He must also be a patient\r\n  hunter when there is a cold scent and the pack is at fault.\"\r\n\r\nWhile there is no country in the world that can produce a breed of\r\nhorses to equal the English thorough-bred in his present improved state,\r\nthere are no dogs like the English fox-hound for speed, scent, and\r\ncontinuance. It would seem as if there were something in the climate\r\nfavourable and necessary to the perfection of the hound. Packs of them\r\nhave been sent to other countries, neighbouring and remote; but they\r\nhave usually become more or less valueless.\r\n\r\nAs regards the employment of the voice and the horn when out with\r\nhounds, too much caution cannot be used. A hound should never be cheered\r\nunless we are perfectly convinced that he is right, nor rated unless we\r\nare sure that he is wrong. When we are not sure of what is going on we\r\nshould sit still and be silent. A few moments will possibly put us in\r\npossession of all that we wish to know. [19]\r\n\r\nThe horn should only be used on particular occasions, and a huntsman\r\nshould speak by his horn as much as by his voice. Particular notes\r\nshould mean certain things, and the hounds and the field should\r\nunderstand the language. We have heard some persons blowing the horn all\r\nthe day long, and the hounds have become so careless as to render it of\r\nno use. When a hound first speaks in cover to a fox, you may, if you\r\nthink it necessary, use 'one single' and prolonged note to get the pack\r\ntogether. The same note will do at any time to call up a lost or\r\nloitering hound; but, when the fox breaks cover, then let your horn be\r\nmarked in its notes: let it sound as if you said through it, \"Gone away!\r\ngone away! gone away! away! away! away!\" dwelling with full emphasis on\r\nthe last syllable. Every hound will fly from the cover the moment he\r\nhears this, and the sportsmen and the field will know that the fox is\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt is the perfection of the horse, and the perfection of the hound, and\r\nthe disregard of trifling expense, that has given to Englishmen a\r\npartiality for field-sports, unequalled in any other country. Mr. Ware's\r\npack of fox-hounds cost 2000 guineas, and the late Lord Middleton gave\r\nthe same to Mr. Osbaldeston for ten couples of his hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING-KENNELS.\r\n\r\nIt is time, however, to speak of the kennel, whether we regard the\r\nsporting architecture of Mr.G. Tattersall, or the scientific inquiries\r\nof Mr. Vyner, or a sketch of the noble buildings at Goodwood.\r\n\r\nThe lodging-rooms should be ceiled, but not plastered, with ventilators\r\nabove and a large airy window on either side. The floors should be laid\r\nwith flags or paved with bricks. Cement may be used instead of mortar,\r\nand the kennels will then be found wholesome and dry. The doorways of\r\nthe lodging-houses will generally be four feet and a half wide, in the\r\nclear. The posts are rounded, to prevent the hounds from being injured\r\nwhen they rush out. The benches may be made of cast-iron or wood; those\r\ncomposed of iron being most durable, but the hounds are more frequently\r\nlamed in getting to them. The wooden benches must be bound with iron, or\r\nthe hounds will gnaw or destroy them. A question has arisen, whether the\r\nbenches should be placed round the kennel, or be in the centre of it,\r\nallowing a free passage by the side. There is least danger of the latter\r\nbeing affected by the damp. The walls should be wainscoted to the height\r\nof three feet at least. This will tend very considerably to their\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nThe floors of all the courts should be arranged in nearly the same way;\r\nthe partition walls being closed at the bottom, but with some iron work\r\nabove. The doorways should also be so contrived, that the huntsman may\r\nbe able to enter whenever he pleases. The boiling-house should be at as\r\ngreat a distance from the hunting-kennel as can be managed, continuing\r\nto give warmth to the infirmary for distempered puppies, and at the same\r\ntime being out of the way of the other courts.\r\n\r\nMr. Vyner gives an interesting account of the young hounds' kennel:\r\n\r\n  \"This building,\" he says, \"should be as far from the other\r\n  lodging-rooms as the arrangements of the structure will allow. There\r\n  is also an additional court, or grass-yard, an indispensable requisite\r\n  in the puppies' kennel. The size must be regulated according to the\r\n  waste land at the end of the building; but the longer it is, the\r\n  better. At the farther end of the grass-court is a hospital for such\r\n  young hounds as are distempered, so contrived as to be remote from the\r\n  other kennels, and, at the same time, within an easy distance of the\r\n  boiling-house, whence it is apparently approached by an outside door,\r\n  through which the feeder can constantly pass to attend to the sick\r\n  hounds without disturbing the healthy lots. Although this lodging room\r\n  is warmed by the chimney of the boiling-house, it must be well\r\n  ventilated by two windows, to which shutters must be attached;\r\n  ventilation and good air being quite as necessary to the cure of\r\n  distemper as warmth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKENNEL LAMENESS.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to a most important and ill-understood subject--the\r\nnature and treatment of 'kennel lameness'. It is a subject that nearly\r\nconcerns the sportsman, and on which there are several and the most\r\ncontrary opinions.\r\n\r\nThis is a kind of lameness connected with, or attributable to, the\r\nkennel. According to the early opinion of Mr. Asheton Smith, who is a\r\ngood authority, it was referable to some peculiarity in the breed or\r\nmanagement of the hounds; but, agreeably to a later opinion, it is\r\ndependent on situation and subsoil, and may be aggravated or increased\r\nby circumstances over which we have no control. Some kennels are in low\r\nand damp situations, yet the hounds are free from all complaint: and\r\nothers, with the stanchest dogs and under the best management, are\r\ncontinually sinking under kennel lameness.\r\n\r\nMr. R. T. Vyner was one of the first who scientifically treated on this\r\npoint, and taught us that 'clay is not by any means an objectionable\r\nsoil to build a kennel upon', although so many pseudo-sportsmen are\r\nfrightened by the very name of it.\r\n\r\nHe enters at once into his subject.\r\n\r\n  \"I am thoroughly convinced,\" says he, \"from my own experience, and, I\r\n  may add, my own suffering, that the disease of kennel lameness arises\r\n  only from one cause, and that is an injudicious and unfortunate\r\n  selection of the spot for building. The kennel is generally built on a\r\n  sand-bed, or on a sandstone rock, while the healthiest grounds in\r\n  England are on a stiff clay, and they are the healthiest because they\r\n  are the least porous. Although this may be contrary to the opinion and\r\n  prejudice of the majority of sportsmen, it is a fact that cannot be\r\n  contradicted.\r\n\r\n  \"Through a light and friable soil, such as sand and sandstone, a\r\n  vapour, more or less dense, is continually exhaling and causing a\r\n  perpetual damp, which produces that fearful rheumatism which goes by\r\n  the name of kennel lameness, while the kennels that are built on a\r\n  clay soil, a soil of an impervious nature, are invariably healthy.\r\n\r\n  \"I could,\" he adds, \"enumerate twenty kennels to prove the effect--the\r\n  invariable effect--of the existence of the disease on the one part,\r\n  and of the healthiness of the situation on the other. I turn\r\n  particularly to her Majesty's kennel at Ascot, the arches of which\r\n  were laid under the very foundation strain, and yet little at no\r\n  amendment has ever taken place in the healthiness and comfort of the\r\n  dogs. It is necessary to select a sound and healthy situation when\r\n  about to erect a kennel, and that sound and healthy situation can be\r\n  met with alone on a strong impervious clay soil. We must have no fluid\r\n  oozing through the walls or the floor of the kennel, and producing\r\n  damp and unhealthy vapours, such as we find in the sandbed.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to this there can be no error.\r\n\r\nNimrod, in his excellent treatise on 'Kennel Lameness', asks, whether it\r\ndoes not appear that this disease is on the increase. He asks,\r\n\r\n  \"How is it that neither Beckford nor Somerville says one word that\r\n  clearly applies to the disease; and no one, however learned he might\r\n  be in canine pathology, has been able clearly to define the disease,\r\n  much less to discover a remedy for it?\"\r\n\r\nAll that Mr. Blaine says on the matter amounts only to this:\r\n\r\n  \"The healthiness of the situation on which any kennel is to be built,\r\n  is an important consideration. It is essential that it should be both\r\n  dry and airy, and it should also be warm. A damp kennel produces\r\n  rheumatism in dogs, which shows itself sometimes by weakness in the\r\n  loins, but more frequently by lameness in the shoulders, known under\r\n  the name of kennel lameness.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine illustrates this by reference to his own experience.\r\n\r\n  \"There is no disease, with the exception of distemper and mange, to\r\n  which dogs are so liable as to a rheumatic affection of some part of\r\n  the body. It presents almost as many varieties in the dog as it does\r\n  in man; and it has some peculiarities observable in the dog only.\r\n  Rheumatism never exists in a dog without affecting the bowels. There\r\n  will be inflammation or painful torpor through the whole of the\r\n  intestinal canal. It is only in some peculiar districts that this\r\n  occurs; it pervades certain kennels only; and but until lately there\r\n  has been little or almost no explanation of the cause of the evil.\"\r\n  [20]\r\n\r\nNimrod took a most important view of the matter, and to him the sporting\r\nworld is much indebted.\r\n\r\n  \"How is it,\" he asks, \"that, in our younger days, we never heard of\r\n  kennel lameness, or, indeed, of hounds being lame at all, unless from\r\n  accident, or becoming shaken and infirm from not having been composed\r\n  of that iron-bound material which the labours of a greyhound or a\r\n  hound require? How is it, that, in our younger days, masters of hounds\r\n  began the season with 50 or 60 couples, and, bating the casualties,\r\n  left off at the end of it equally strong in their kennels, and able,\r\n  perhaps, to make a valuable draft; whereas we now hear of one-half of\r\n  the dogs in certain localities being disabled by disease, and some\r\n  masters of hounds compelled to be stopped in their work until their\r\n  kennels are replenished.\"\r\n\r\nWashing hounds when they come home after work must be injurious to them,\r\nalthough it has almost become the fashion of modern times. If they are\r\nnot washed at all, and we believe it to be unnecessary, yet the kennels\r\nin which lameness has appeared should be strictly avoided. It should be\r\non the day following and not in the evening of a hunting-day that\r\nwashing should take place.\r\n\r\nMr. Hodgson told Nimrod, that the Quorn Pack never had a case of kennel\r\nlameness until his late huntsman took to washing his hounds after\r\nhunting, and then he often had four or five couples ill from this cause.\r\nHe deprecated even their access to water in the evening after hunting,\r\nand we believe that he was quite right in  so doing.\r\n\r\nThe tongue of the dog, with the aid of clean straw, is his best and\r\nsafest instrument in cleansing his person; and, if he can be brought to\r\nhis kennel with tolerably clean feet, as Mr. Foljambe enables him to be\r\nbrought, he will never be long before he is comfortable in his bed,\r\nafter his belly is filled.\r\n\r\nThere is another mode, as a preventive of kennel lameness, which we have\r\nthe best authority for saying deserves particular attention, and that\r\nis, the frequently turning hounds off their benches during the day, even\r\nif it were to the extent of every two hours throughout the entire day.\r\nWe do not mean to deny the existence of a disease, which, being produced\r\nin the kennel, is properly termed kennel lameness. Some kennels are, no\r\ndoubt, more unhealthy and prone to engender rheumatic affections than\r\nothers; but, by proper management, and avoiding as much as possible all\r\nexciting causes, their effects may, at least, be very much lessened, if\r\nnot entirely obviated.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD FITZHARDINGE'S MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nLord Fitzhardinge's opinion of the situation of the kennel and the\r\nmanagement of the hounds, as given in the 'New Sporting Magazine', is\r\nsomewhat different from that which has been just given. The following is\r\nthe substance of it: [21]\r\n\r\nHe states that the kennel should be built on a dry and warm situation.\r\nOf this there can be no doubt: the comfort and almost the existence of\r\nthe dog depend upon it. To this he adds that it must not be placed on a\r\ngravelly or porous soil, over which vapours more or less dense are\r\nfrequently or continually travelling, and thus causing a destructive\r\nexhalation over the whole of the building. There must be no fluid oozing\r\nthrough the walls or the floor of the kennel, and producing damp and\r\nunhealthy vapours. When we have not a deep supersoil of clay, one or two\r\nlayers of bricks or of stone may line the floor, and then, not even the\r\nmost subtile vapour can penetrate through the floor. A clean bed of\r\nstraw should be allowed every second day, or oftener when the weather is\r\nwet. The lodging-houses should be ceiled, and there should be shutters\r\nto the windows. A thatched roof is preferable to tiles, being warmer in\r\nwinter and cooler in summer.\r\n\r\nStoves in the kennels are not necessary: probably they are best avoided;\r\nfor, if dogs are accustomed to any considerable degree of artificial\r\nheat, they are more easily chilled by a long exposure to cold. Their\r\nteeth and the setting-up of their backs will confirm this.\r\n\r\nHounds, when they feel cold, naturally seek each other for warmth, and\r\nthey may be seen lying upon the straw and licking each other; and that\r\nis by far the most wholesome way of procuring comfort and warmth.\r\n\r\nOn returning from hunting, their feet should be washed with some warm\r\nfluid, and especially the eyes should be examined, and their food got\r\nready for them as soon as possible. The feeding in the morning should be\r\nan hour, or an hour and a half, before they start for the field.\r\n\r\nIt is truly observed by the noble writer to whom we have referred, that\r\nthere is no part of an establishment of this kind that merits more\r\nattention than the boiling and feeding house. The hounds cannot perform\r\ntheir work well unless judiciously fed. Each hound requires particular\r\nand constitutional care. No more than five of them should be let in to\r\nfeed together, and often not more than one or two. The feeder should\r\nhave each hound under his immediate observation, or they may get too\r\nmuch or too little of the food.\r\n\r\nSome hounds cannot run if they carry much flesh; others are all the\r\nbetter for having plenty about them. The boilers should be of iron, two\r\nin number,--one for meal and the smaller one for flesh. The large boiler\r\nshould render it necessary to be used not more than once in four days or\r\na week. The food should be stirred for two hours, then transferred to\r\nflat coolers, until sufficiently gelatinous to be cut with a kind of\r\nspade. By the admixture of some portion of soups it may be brought to\r\nany thickness requisite. The flesh to be mixed with it should be cut\r\nvery small, that the greedy hounds may not be able to obtain more than\r\ntheir share. Four bushels and a half of genuine old oatmeal should be\r\nboiled with a hundred gallons of water. The flesh should he boiled every\r\nsecond or third day. Too great a proportion of soup would render the\r\nmixture of a heating nature.\r\n\r\nMr. Delmé Radcliffe very truly observes that the feeding of hounds, as\r\nregards their condition, is one of the most essential proofs of a\r\nhuntsman's skill in the management of the kennel. To preserve that even\r\nstate of condition throughout the pack which is so desirable, he must be\r\nwell acquainted with the appetite of every hound; for some will feed\r\nwith a voracity scarcely credible, and others will require every kind of\r\nenticement to induce them to feed.\r\n\r\nMr. Meynell found that the use of dry unboiled oatmeal succeeded better\r\nthan any other thing he had tried with delicate hounds. When once\r\ninduced to take it, they would eat it greedily, and it seemed to be far\r\nmore heartening than most kinds of aliment. Other hounds of delicate\r\nconstitution might be tempted with a little additional flesh, and with\r\nthe thickest and best of the trough, but they required to be watched,\r\nand often to be coaxed to eat.\r\n\r\nThe dog possesses the power of struggling against want of food for an\r\nalmost incredible period. One of these animals, six years old, was\r\nmissing three-and-twenty days; at length some children wandering in a\r\ndistant wood thought that they frequently heard the baying of a dog. The\r\nmaster was told of it, and at the bottom of an old quarry, sixty feet\r\ndeep, and the mouth of which he had almost closed by his vain attempts\r\nto escape, the voice of the poor fellow was recognised. With much\r\ndifficulty he was extricated, and found in a state of emaciation; his\r\nbody cold as ice and his thirst inextinguishable, and he scarcely able\r\nto move. They gave him at intervals small portions of bread soaked in\r\nmilk and water. Two days afterwards he was able to follow his master a\r\nshort distance.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence is mentioned by M. Pinguin as a proof that neither\r\nhunger nor thirst could produce rabies. Messrs. Majendie and F. Cousins\r\nhave carried their observations to the extent of forty days--a\r\ndisgraceful period. [22]\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF THE PACK.\r\n\r\nSixty-five couple of hounds in full work will consume the carcases of\r\nthree horses in one week, or five in a fortnight. The annual consumption\r\nof meal will be somewhat more than two tons per month.\r\n\r\nIn feeding, the light eaters should be let in first, and a little extra\r\nflesh distributed on the surface of the food, in order to coax those\r\nthat are most shy. Some hounds cannot be kept to their work unless fed\r\ntwo or three times a day; while others must not be allowed more than six\r\nor seven laps, or they would get too much.\r\n\r\nIn summer an extra cow or two will be of advantage in the dairy; for the\r\nmilk, after it has been skimmed, may be used instead of flesh. There\r\nmust always be a little flesh in hand for the sick, for bitches with\r\ntheir whelps, and for the entry of young hounds.[23]  About Christmas is\r\nthe time to arrange the breeding establishment. The number of puppies\r\nproduced is usually from five to eight or nine; but, in one strange\r\ncase, eighteen of them made their appearance. The constitution and other\r\nappearances in the dam, will decide the number to be preserved. When the\r\nwhelps are sufficiently grown to run about, they should be placed in a\r\nwarm situation, with plenty of fresh grass, and a sufficient quantity of\r\nclean, but not too stimulating, food. They should then be marked\r\naccording to their respective letters, that they may be always\r\nrecognised. When the time comes, the ears of the dog should be rounded;\r\nthe size of the ear and of the head guiding the rounding-iron.\r\n\r\nThis being passed, the master of the pack takes care that his treatment\r\nshall be joyous and playful; encouragement is always with him the word.\r\nThe dog should be taught the nature of the fault before he is corrected:\r\nno animal is more grateful for kindness than a hound; the peculiarities\r\nof his temper will soon be learned, and when he begins to love his\r\nmaster, he will mind, from his natural and acquired affection, a word or\r\na frown from him more than the blows of all the whips that were ever put\r\ninto the hands of the keepers.\r\n\r\nThe distemper having passed, and the young hounds being in good health,\r\nthey should be walked out every day, and taught to follow the horse,\r\nwith a keeper who is selected as a kind and quiet person, and will bear\r\ntheir occasionally entangling themselves in their couples. They are then\r\ntaken to the public roads, and there exercised, and checked from riot,\r\nbut with as little severity as possible; a frequent and free use of the\r\nwhip never being allowed. No animals take their character from their\r\nmaster so much as the hounds do from theirs. If he is wild, or noisy, or\r\nnervous, so will his hounds be; if he is steady and quick, the pack will\r\nbe the same. The whip should never be applied but for some immediate and\r\ndecided fault. A rate given at an improper time does more harm than\r\ngood: it disgusts the honest hound, it shies and prevents from hunting\r\nthe timid one, and it is treated with contempt by those of another\r\ncharacter who may at some future time deserve it. It formerly was the\r\ncustom, and still is too much so, when a hound 'has hung on a hare', to\r\ncatch him when he comes up, and flog him. The consequence of this is,\r\nthat he takes good care the next time he indulges in a fault not to come\r\nout of cover at all.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude this part of our subject by a short account of the\r\nsplendid kennel at Goodwood, for which we are indebted to Lord W.\r\nLennox, with the kind permission of the Duke of Richmond. It is\r\ndescribed as one of the most complete establishments of the kind in\r\nEngland. The original establishment of this building, although a little\r\nfaulty, possesses considerable interest from its errors being corrected\r\nby the third Duke of Richmond, a man who is acknowledged to have been\r\none of the most popular public characters of the day, and who in more\r\nprivate life extended his patronage to all that was truly honourable. It\r\nwas to the Duke's support of native talent that we may trace the origin\r\nof the present Royal Academy. In 1758, the Duke of Richmond displayed,\r\nat his residence in Whitehall, a large collection of original plaster\r\ncasts, taken from the finest statues and busts of the ancient sculptors.\r\nEvery artist was freely admitted to this exhibition and, for the further\r\nencouragement of talent, he bestowed two medals annually on such as had\r\nexhibited the best models.\r\n\r\nWe have thus digressed in order to give a slight sketch of the nobleman\r\nby whom this kennel was built, and we do not think that we can do better\r\nthan lay before our readers the original account of it.\r\n\r\nEarly in life the Duke built what was not then common, a tennis-court,\r\nand what was more uncommon, a dog-kennel, which cost him above £6000.\r\nThe Duke was his own architect, assisted by, and under the guidance of,\r\nMr. Wyatt; he dug his own flints, burnt his own lime, and conducted the\r\nwood-work in his own shops. The result of his labours was the noble\r\nbuilding of which a plan is here given.\r\n\r\nThe dog-kennel is a grand object when viewed from Goodwood. The front is\r\nhandsome, the ground well raised about it, and the general effect good;\r\nthe open court in the centre adds materially to the noble appearance of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the kennel is delineated in the centre with a flight of\r\nstairs leading above. The huntsman's rooms, four in number first present\r\nthemselves, and are marked in the plan before us by the letter C; each\r\nof them is fifteen feet four inches, by fourteen feet six inches.\r\n\r\nAt each end of the side towards the court is one of the feeding-rooms,\r\ntwenty-nine feet by fourteen feet four inches, and nobly constructed\r\nrooms they are; they are designated by the letters B. At the back of the\r\nfeeding-rooms, are one set of the lodging-rooms, from thirty-five feet\r\nsix inches, to fourteen feet four inches, and marked by the letters A,\r\nand at either extremity is another lodging-room, thirty-two feet six\r\ninches in length, and fourteen feet six inches in width: this is also\r\nmarked by the letter A.\r\n\r\nComing into the court we find the store-room twenty-four feet by\r\nfourteen and a half, marked by the letter D, and the stable, of the same\r\ndimensions, by the letter E.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the buildings are openings for the admission of cold air,\r\nand stoves to warm the air when too cold. There are plentiful supplies\r\nof water from tanks holding 10,000 gallons; so that there is no\r\ninconvenience from the smell, and the whole can at any time be drained,\r\nand not be rendered altogether useless.\r\n\r\nRound the whole building is a pavement five feet wide; airy yards and\r\nplaces for breeding, &c., making part of each wing. For the huntsman and\r\nwhipper-in there are sleeping-rooms, and a neat parlour or kitchen.\r\n\r\nSoon after the kennel was erected, it would contain two packs\r\nof hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STAG-HOUND.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the English hounds that has been lately used, is devoted,\r\nas his name implies, to the chase of the deer. He is taller than the\r\nfox-hound, and with far more delicate scent, but he is not so speedy. He\r\nanswers better than any other to the description given of the old\r\nEnglish hound, so much valued when the country, less enclosed, and the\r\nforests, numerous and extensive, were the harbours of the wild deer. The\r\ndeer-hound and the harrier were for many centuries the only\r\nhunting-dogs. The fox-hound has been much more recently bred.\r\n\r\nThe most tyrannic and cruel laws were enforced for the preservation of\r\nthis species of game, and the life of the deer, except when sacrificed\r\nin the chase, and by those who were privileged to join in it, was\r\nguarded with even more strictness than the life of the human being.\r\nWhen, however, the country became more generally cultivated, and the\r\nstag was confined to enclosed parks, and was seldom sought in his lair,\r\nbut brought into the field, and turned out before the dogs, so much\r\ninterest was taken from the affair, that this species of hunting grew\r\nout of fashion, and was confined to the neighbourhood of the scattered\r\nforests that remained, and enjoyed only by royalty and a few noblemen,\r\nof whose establishment a kennel of deer-hounds had, from time\r\nimmemorial, formed a part.\r\n\r\nSince the death of George III, who was much attached to this sport,\r\nstag-hunting has rapidly declined, and the principal pleasure seems now\r\nto consist in the concourse of people brought together to an appointed\r\nplace and hour, to witness the turning out of the deer. There is still\r\nmaintained a royal establishment for the continuance of this noble\r\nsport, but, unless better supported than it has of late years been, it\r\nwill gradually decline.\r\n\r\nThe stag-hounds are now a part of the regular Crown establishment. The\r\nroyal kennel is situated upon Ascot Heath, about six miles from Windsor.\r\nAt the distance of a mile from the kennel is Swinley Lodge, the official\r\nresidence of the Master of the Stag-hounds.\r\n\r\nThe stag-hound is a beautiful animal. He is distinguished from the\r\nfox-hound by the apparent broadness and shortness of his head, his\r\nlonger cheek, his straighter hock, his wider thigh and deeper chest, and\r\nbetter feathered and more beautifully arched tail. His appearance\r\nindicates strength and stoutness, in which indeed he is unequalled, and\r\nhe has sufficient speed to render it difficult for the best horses long\r\nto keep pace with him; while, as is necessary, when the distance between\r\nthe footmarks of the deer is considered, his scent is most exquisite. He\r\nis far seldomer at fault than any other hound except the blood-hound,\r\nand rarely fails of running down his game.\r\n\r\nOf the stoutness of this dog, the following anecdotes will be a\r\nsufficient illustration. A deer, in the spring of 1822, was turned out\r\nbefore the Earl of Derby's hounds in Hayes Common. The chase was\r\ncontinued nearly four hours without a check, when, being almost run\r\ndown, the animal took refuge in some outhouses near Speldhurst in Kent,\r\nmore than forty miles across the country, and having actually run more\r\nthan fifty miles. Nearly twenty horses died in the field, or in\r\nconsequence of the severity of the chase.\r\n\r\nA stag was turned out at Wingfield Park, in Northumberland. The whole\r\npack, with the exception of two hounds, was, after a long run, thrown\r\nout. The stag returned to his accustomed haunt, and, as his last effort,\r\nleaped the wall of the park, and lay down and died. One of the hounds,\r\nunable to clear the wall, fell and expired, and the other was found dead\r\nat a little distance. They had run about forty miles.\r\n\r\n  \"When the stag first hears the cry of the hounds, he runs with the\r\n  swiftness of the wind, and continues to run as long as any sound of\r\n  his pursuers can be distinguished. That having ceased, he pauses and\r\n  looks carefully around him; but before he can determine what course to\r\n  pursue, the cry of the pack again forces itself upon his attention.\r\n  Once more he darts away, and after a while again pauses. His strength\r\n  perhaps begins to fail, and he has recourse to stratagem in order to\r\n  escape. He practises the doubling and the crossing of the fox or the\r\n  hare. This being useless, he attempts to escape by plunging into some\r\n  lake or river that happens to lie in his way, and when, at last, every\r\n  attempt to escape proves abortive, he boldly faces his pursuers, and\r\n  attacks the first dog or man who approaches him.\" [24]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN HOUND.\r\n\r\nThere used to be in the south of Devon a pack or cry of the genuine old\r\nEnglish or southern hounds. There is some reason to believe that this\r\nwas the original stock of the island, or of this part of the island, and\r\nthat this hound was used by the ancient Britons in the chase of the\r\nlarger kinds of game with which the country formerly abounded. Its\r\ndistinguishing characters are its size and general heavy appearance; its\r\ngreat length of body, deep chest, and ears remarkably large and\r\npendulous. The tones of its voice were peculiarly deep. It answered the\r\ndescription of Shakspeare:\r\n\r\n  \"So flewed, so sanded; and their heads are hung\r\n  With ears that sweep away the morning dew;\r\n  Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd, like Thessalian bulls;\r\n  Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,\r\n  Each under each.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the slowness of the breed which occasioned its disuse. Several of\r\nthem, however, remained not long ago at a village called Aveton Gifford,\r\nin Devonshire, in the neighbourhood of which some of the most opulent of\r\nthe farmers used to keep two or three dogs each. When fox-hunting had\r\nassumed somewhat of its modern form, the chase was followed by a slow\r\nheavy hound, whose excellent olfactory organs enabled him to carry on\r\nthe scent a considerable time after the fox-hound passed, and also over\r\ngrassy fallows, and hard roads, and other places, where the modern\r\nhigh-bred fox-hound would not be able to recognise it. Hence the chase\r\ncontinued for double the duration which it does at present, and hence\r\nmay be seen the reason why the old English hunter, so celebrated in\r\nformer days and so great a favourite among sportsmen of the old school,\r\nwas enabled to perform those feats which were exultingly bruited in his\r\npraise. The fact is, that the hounds and the horse were well matched. If\r\nthe latter possessed not the speed of the Meltonian hunter, the hounds\r\nwere equally slow and stanch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLOOD-HOUND.\r\n\r\nThis dog does not materially differ in appearance from the old\r\ndeer-hound of a larger size, trained to hunt the human being instead of\r\nthe quadruped. If once put on the track of a supposed robber, he would\r\nunerringly follow him to his retreat, although at the distance of many a\r\nmile. Such a breed was necessary when neither the private individual nor\r\nthe government had other means to detect the offender. Generally\r\nspeaking, however, the blood-hound of former days would not injure the\r\nculprit that did not attempt to escape, but would lie down quietly and\r\ngive notice by a loud and peculiar howl what kind of prey he had found.\r\nSome, however, of a savage disposition, or trained to unnatural\r\nferocity, would tear to pieces the hunted wretch, if timely rescue did\r\nnot arrive.\r\n\r\nHounds of every kind, both great and small, may be broken in to follow\r\nany particular scent, and especially when they are feelingly convinced\r\nthat they are not to hunt any other. This is the case with the\r\nblood-hound. He is destined to one particular object of pursuit, and a\r\ntotal stranger with regard to every other.\r\n\r\nIn the border country between England and Scotland, and until the union\r\nof the two kingdoms, these dogs were absolutely necessary for the\r\npreservation of property, and the detection of robbery and murder. A tax\r\nwas levied on the inhabitants for the maintenance of a certain number of\r\nblood-hounds. When, however, the civic government had sufficient power\r\nto detect and punish crime, this dangerous breed of hounds fell into\r\ndisuse and was systematically discouraged. It, nevertheless, at the\r\npresent day, is often bred by the rangers in large forests or parks to\r\ntrack the deer-stealer, but oftener to find the wounded deer.\r\n\r\nThe blood-hound is taller and better formed than the deer-hound. It has\r\nlarge and deep ears, the forehead broad and the muzzle narrow. The\r\nexpression of the countenance is mild and pleasing, when the dog is not\r\nexcited; but, when he is following the robber, his ferocity becomes\r\ntruly alarming.\r\n\r\nThe Thrapstone Association lately trained a blood-hound for the\r\ndetection of sheepstealers. In order to prove the utility of this dog, a\r\nperson whom he had not seen was ordered to run as far and as fast as his\r\nstrength would permit. An hour afterwards the hound was brought out. He\r\nwas placed on the spot whence the man had started. He almost immediately\r\ndetected the scent and broke away, and, after a chase of an hour and a\r\nhalf, found him concealed in a tree, fifteen miles distant.\r\n\r\nMr. John Lawrence says, that a servant, discharged by a sporting country\r\ngentleman, broke into his stables by night, and cut off the ears and\r\ntail of a favourite hunter. As soon as it was discovered, a blood-hound\r\nwas brought into the stable, who at once detected the scent of the\r\nmiscreant, and traced it more than twenty miles. He then stopped at a\r\ndoor, whence no power could move him. Being at length admitted, he ran\r\nto the top of the house, and, bursting open the door of a garret, found\r\nthe object that he sought in bed, and would have torn him to pieces, had\r\nnot the huntsman, who had followed him on a fleet horse, rushed up after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSomerville thus describes the use to which he was generally put, in\r\npursuit of the robber:\r\n\r\n  \"Soon the sagacious brute, his curling tail\r\n  Flourished in air, low bending, plies around\r\n  His busy nose, the steaming vapour snuffs\r\n  Inquisitive, nor leaves one turf untried,\r\n  Till, conscious of the recent stains, his heart\r\n  Beats quick. His snuffing nose, his active tail,\r\n  Attest his joy. Then, with deep opening mouth,\r\n  That makes the welkin tremble, he proclaims\r\n  Th' audacious felon. Foot by foot he marks\r\n  His winding way. Over the watery ford,\r\n  Dry sandy heaths, and stony barren hills,\r\n  Unerring he pursues, till at the cot\r\n  Arrived, and seizing by his guilty throat\r\n  The caitiff vile, redeems the captive prey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SETTER\r\n\r\nis evidently the large spaniel improved to his peculiar size and beauty,\r\nand taught another way of marking his game, viz., by 'setting' or\r\ncrouching. If the form of the dog were not sufficiently satisfactory on\r\nthis point, we might have recourse to history for information on it. Mr.\r\nDaniel, in his 'Rural Sports', has preserved a document, dated in the\r\nyear 1685, in which a yeoman binds himself for the sum of ten shillings,\r\nfully and effectually to teach a spaniel to 'sit' partridges and\r\npheasants.\r\n\r\n[As this old document may prove interesting to the curious, we take the\r\nliberty of inserting it, knowing full well, that Mr. Daniel's work is\r\nquite rare in this country, and copies of it are not easily obtained\r\neven in England.\r\n\r\n  Ribbesford, Oct. 7, 1685,\r\n\r\n  \"I, John Harris, of Willdon, in the parish of Hastlebury, in the\r\n  county of Worcester, yeoman, for and in consideration of ten shillings\r\n  of lawful English money this day received of Henry Herbert of\r\n  Ribbesford, in the said county, Esqr., and of thirty shillings more of\r\n  like money by him promised to be hereafter pay'd me, do hereby\r\n  covenant and promise to and with the said Henry Herbert, his exôrs and\r\n  admôrs, that I will, from the day of the date hereof, untill the first\r\n  day of March next, well and sufficiently mayntayne and keepe a Spanile\r\n  Bitch named Quand, this day delivered into my custody by the said\r\n  Henry Herbert, and will, before the first day of March next, fully and\r\n  effectually traine up and teach the said Bitch to sitt Partridges,\r\n  Pheasants, and other game, as well and exactly as the best sitting\r\n  Doggers usually sett the same.

Payne, his X mark.\"\r\n\r\n  L.]\r\n\r\nThe first person, however, who systematically broke-in setting dogs is\r\nsupposed to have been Dudley Duke of Northumberland in 1335.\r\n\r\nA singular dog-cause was tried in Westminster, in July, 1822. At a\r\nprevious trial it was determined that the mere possession of a dog,\r\ngenerally used for destroying game, was sufficient proof of its being\r\nactually so used. Mr. Justice Best, however, determined that a man might\r\nbe a breeder of such dogs without using them as game-dogs; and Mr.\r\nJustice Bailey thought that if a game-dog was kept in a yard, chained up\r\nby day, and let loose at night, and, being so trained as to guard the\r\npreimises, he was to be considered as a yard-dog, and not as a game-dog.\r\n\r\nThe setter is used for the same purpose as the pointer, and there is\r\ngreat difference of opinion with regard to their relative value as\r\nsporting-dogs. Setters are not so numerous; and they are dearer, and\r\nwith great difficulty obtained pure. It was long the fashion to cross\r\nand mix them with the pointer, by which no benefit was obtained, but the\r\nbeauty of the dog materially impaired; many Irish sportsmen, however,\r\nwere exceedingly careful to preserve the breed pure. Nothing of the\r\npointer can be traced in them, and they are useful and beautiful dogs,\r\naltogether different in appearance from either the English or Scotch\r\nsetter. The Irish sportsmen are, perhaps, a little too much prejudiced\r\nwith regard to particular colours. Their dogs ate either very red, or\r\nred and white, or lemon-coloured, or white, patched with deep chestnut;\r\nand it was necessary for them to have a black nose, and a black roof to\r\nthe mouth. This peculiar dye is supposed to be as necessary to a good\r\nand genuine Irish setter as is the palate of a Blenheim spaniel to the\r\npurity of his breed. A true Irish setter will obtain a higher price than\r\neither an English or Scotch one. Fifty guineas constituted no unusual\r\nprice for a brace of them, and even two hundred guineas have been given.\r\nIt is nevertheless, doubtful whether they do in reality so much exceed\r\nthe other breeds, and whether, although stout and hard-working dogs, and\r\nwith excellent scent, they are not somewhat too headstrong and unruly.\r\n\r\nThe setter is more active than the pointer. He has greater spirit and\r\nstrength. He will better stand continued hard work. He will generally\r\ntake the water when necessary, and, retaining the character of the\r\nbreed, is more companionable and attached. He loves his master for\r\nhimself, and not, like the pointer, merely for the pleasure he shares\r\nwith him. His somewhat inferior scent, however, makes him a little too\r\napt to run into his game, and he occasionally has a will of his own. He\r\nrequires good breaking, and plenty of work; but that breaking must be of\r\na peculiar character: it must not partake of the severity which too\r\noften accompanies, and unnecessarily so, the tuition of the pointer. He\r\nhas more animal spirit than the pointer, but he has not so much patient\r\ncourage; and the chastisement, sometimes unnecessary and cruel, but\r\nleaving the pointer perfect in his work, and eager for it too, would\r\nmake the setter disgusted with it, and leave him a mere 'blinker'. It is\r\ndifficult, however, always to decide the claim of superiority between\r\nthese dogs. He that has a good one of either breed may be content, but\r\nthe lineage of that dog must be pure. The setter, with much of the\r\npointer in him, loses something in activity and endurance; and the\r\npointer, crossed with the setter, may have a degree of wildness and\r\nobstinacy, not a little annoying to his owner. The setter may be\r\npreferable when the ground is hard and rough; for he does not soon\r\nbecome foot-sore. He may even answer the purpose of a springer for\r\npheasants and woodcocks, and may be valuable in recovering a wounded\r\nbird. His scent may frequently be superior to that of the pointer, and\r\nsufficiently accurate to distinguish, better than the pointer, when the\r\ngame is sprung; but the steadiness and obedience of the pointer will\r\ngenerally give him the preference, especially in a fair and tolerably\r\nsmooth country. At the beginning of a season, and until the weather is\r\nhot, the pointer will have a decided advantage.\r\n\r\n[We beg leave to finish this history of the setter by referring to our\r\nessay on this dog, published in vol. xv, No. 47, of the \"New York Spirit\r\nof the Times\", or as lately transferred to the pages of an interesting\r\nand valuable sporting work, about being published by our esteemed\r\nfriend, Wm. A. Porter, and from which we now abstract our remarks upon\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MERITS OF THE SETTER COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE POINTER.\r\n\r\nIt cannot for a moment be doubted that the setter has superior\r\nadvantages to the pointer, for hunting over our uncleared country,\r\nalthough the pointer has many qualities that recommend him to the\r\nsportsman, that the setter does not possess. In the first place, the\r\nextreme hardiness and swiftness of foot, natural to the setter, enables\r\nhim to get over much more ground than the pointer, in the same space of\r\ntime. Their feet also, being more hard and firm, are not so liable to\r\nbecome sore from contact with our frozen ground. The ball pads being\r\nwell protected by the spaniel toe-tufts, are less likely to be wounded\r\nby the thorns and burs with which our woods are crowded during the\r\nwinter season. His natural enthusiasm for hunting, coupled with his\r\nsuperior physical powers, enables him to stand much more work than the\r\npointer, and oftentimes he appears quite fresh upon a long continued\r\nhunt, when the other will be found drooping and inattentive.\r\n\r\nThe long, thick fur of the setter, enables him to wend his way through\r\nbriary thickets without injury to himself, when a similar attempt on the\r\npart of a pointer, would result in his ears, tail, and body being\r\nlacerated and streaming with blood.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the pointer is superior to the setter in retaining\r\nhis acquired powers for hunting, and not being naturally enthusiastic in\r\npursuit of game, he is more easily broken and kept in proper subjection.\r\n\r\nThe setter frequently requires a partial rebreaking at the commencement\r\nof each season, in his younger days, owing to the natural eagerness with\r\nwhich he resumes the sport. The necessity of this, however, diminishes\r\nwith age, as the character and habits of the dog become more settled,\r\nand then we may take them into the field, with a perfect assurance of\r\ntheir behaving quite as well on the first hunt of the season, as the\r\nstanchest pointer would.\r\n\r\nThe extreme caution, and mechanical powers of the pointer in the field,\r\nis a barrier to his flushing the birds, as is often witnessed in the\r\nprecipitate running of the setter, who winds the game and frequently\r\noverruns it in his great anxiety to come up with it. But this occasional\r\nfault on the part of the setter, may be counterbalanced by the larger\r\nquantity of game that he usually finds in a day's hunt, owing to his\r\nenthusiasm and swiftness of foot. Setters require much more water while\r\nhunting than the pointer, owing to their thick covering of fur,\r\nencouraging a greater amount of insensible perspiration to fly off than\r\nthe thin and short dress of the pointer. Consequently they are better\r\ncalculated to hunt in the coldest seasons than early in our falls, which\r\nare frequently quite dry and warm.\r\n\r\nA striking instance of this fact came under our own immediate\r\nobservation this fall, when shooting in a range of country thinly\r\nsettled and uncommonly dry. The day being warm and the birds scarce, the\r\ndogs suffered greatly from thirst, in so much that a very fine setter of\r\nuncommon bottom, was forced to give up entirely, completely prostrated,\r\nfoaming at the mouth in the most alarming manner, breathing heavily, and\r\nvomiting from time to time a thick frothy mucus.\r\n\r\nHis prostration of both muscular and nervous powers was so great, that\r\nhe could neither smell nor take the slightest notice of a bird, although\r\nplaced at his nose. He could barely manage to drag one leg after the\r\nother, stopping to rest every few moments, and we were fearful that we\r\nshould be obliged to shoulder and carry him to a farm-house, a\r\nconsiderable distance off. However, he succeeded, with much difficulty,\r\nin reaching the well, where he greedily drank several pints of water\r\nadministered to him with caution.\r\n\r\nHe recovered almost immediately, gave me a look of thanks, and was off\r\nto the fields in a few moments, where he soon found a fine covey of\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nThe pointer, his associate in the day's work, and a much less hardy dog,\r\nstood the hunt remarkably well, and seemed to suffer little or no\r\ninconvenience from the want of water. The setter has natural claims upon\r\nthe sportsman and man generally, in his affectionate disposition and\r\nattachment to his master, and the many winning manners he exhibits\r\ntowards those by whom he is caressed.\r\n\r\nThe pointer displays but little fondness for those by whom he is\r\nsurrounded, and hunts equally as well for a stranger as his master.--L.]\r\n\r\nOf the difference between the old English setter and the setters of the\r\npresent day, we confess that we are ignorant, except that the first was\r\nthe pure spaniel improved, and the latter the spaniel crossed too\r\nfrequently with the pointer.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged, that of companionableness, and disinterested\r\nattachment and gratitude, the pointer knows comparatively little. If he\r\nis a docile and obedient servant in the field, it is all we want. The\r\nsetter is unquestionably his superior in every amiable quality. Mr.\r\nBlaine says, that a large setter, ill with the distemper, had been\r\nnursed by a lady more than three weeks. At length he became so ill as to\r\nbe placed in a bed, where he remained a couple of days in a dying state.\r\nAfter a short absence, the lady, re-entering the room, observed him to\r\nfix his eyes attentively on her, and make an effort to crawl across the\r\nbed towards her. This he accomplished, evidently for the sole purpose of\r\nlicking her hand, after which he immediately expired.\r\n\r\n[Daniel Lambert celebrated for his enormous magnitude, weighing seven\r\nhundred and thirty-nine pounds, had a very superior breed of sellers,\r\nwhich were publicly sold, at the following prices; after his death,\r\nwhich forcibly illustrates the immense value placed on this dog in\r\nEngland; whereas, many American sportsmen considers it a great hardship\r\nto be obliged to give thirty or forty dollars for a well-bred setter in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n                                                       Guineas\r\n\r\nPeg,       a black Setter Bitch..........................41\r\nPunch,     a Setter Dog..................................26\r\nBrush,     do  ..........................................17\r\nBob,       do............................................30\r\nBell,      do........................................... 32\r\nBounce,    do............................................22\r\nSam,       do............................................26\r\nCharlotte, a Pointer Bitch...............................22\r\nLucy,      do............................................12\r\n                                                      ------\r\n                                                        218     --L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pointer is evidently descended from the hound.\r\n\r\n[We beg leave to make the following extracts from our essay on this\r\nsubject, published in No. 1, vol. xvi, of the \"Spirit of the Times\":\r\n\r\nThe origin of the pointer, like that of the setter, is involved in much\r\nobscurity; he is of mixed blood, and no doubt largely indebted to both\r\nhound and spaniel for his distinct existence.\r\n\r\nMany sportsmen are under the erroneous idea that the pointer is\r\ncontemporary with, if not older than, the Setter. Such, however, is not\r\nthe case; and we are led to believe that the Pointer is of quite modern\r\norigin; at all events, the production of a much later date than the\r\nspaniel.\r\n\r\nStrut, in his \"Sports and Pastimes\", chap. 1, sects. xv. and xvi.,\r\nmentions a MS. in the Cotton Library, originally written by William\r\nTwici, or Twety, Grand Huntsman to Edward II, who ascended the throne in\r\n1307.\r\n\r\nThis manuscript contains the earliest treatise on hunting that the\r\nEnglish possess, and enumerates the various kinds of game and different\r\nspecies of dogs then in existence, as also the modes of taking the\r\nformer and using the latter.\r\n\r\nAfter describing, in the usual minute manner, the specific employment of\r\neach  dog, he finishes by stating:\r\n\r\n  \"The spaniel was for use in hawking, hys crafte is for the perdrich or\r\n  partridge, and the quail; and when taught to couch, he is very\r\n  serviceable to the fowler, who takes these birds with nets.\"\r\n\r\nNo mention is made in this treatise of the pointer, and we naturally\r\ninfer that he did not exist, or he would have been noticed in connexion\r\nwith the spaniel, who, it appears, even at this early period, was taught\r\nto 'couch' on and point out game to those employed in netting it.\r\n\r\nIn the early portion of the sixteenth century, we have another\r\nenumeration of dogs, 'then' in use, in a book entitled--\"A Jewel for\r\nGentrie;\" which, besides the dogs already descanted upon by Twici, we\r\nfind added to the list,\r\n\r\n  \"bastards and mongrels, lemors, kenets, terrours, butchers' hounds,\r\n  dung-hill dogs, trindel-tailed dogs, prychercard curs, and ladies'\r\n  puppies.\"\r\n  (Chap. 1st., Sec. XVI.--Strut.)\r\n\r\nThe pointer being the offspring of the fox-hound and spaniel, is\r\nconsequently sprung from the two ancient races known as 'Sagaces' and\r\n'Pugnaces' or 'Bellicosi'. He certainly evinces a larger share of the\r\n'Bellicosi' blood than the setter, being ever ready for fight when\r\nassailed, while the latter generally exhibits a conciliatory disposition\r\nunder the most trying circumstances.--L.]\r\n\r\nIt is the fox-hound searching for game by the scent, but more perfectly\r\nunder the control of the sportsman, repressing his cry of joy when he\r\nfinds his game, and his momentary pause, and gathering himself up in\r\norder to spring upon it artificially, converted into a steady and\r\ndeliberate point. There still remains a strong resemblance, in\r\ncountenance and in form, between the pointer and the fox-hound, except\r\nthat the muzzle is shorter, and the ears smaller, and partly pendulous.\r\n\r\nSeventy or eighty years ago, the breed of pointers was nearly white, or\r\nvaried with liver-coloured spots; some, however, belonging to the Duke\r\nof Kingston, were perfectly black. This peculiarity of colour was\r\nsupposed to be connected with exquisite perfection of scent. That is not\r\nthe case with the present black pointers, who are not superior to any\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel relates an anecdote of one of his pointers. He had a dog that\r\nwould always go round close to the hedges of a field before he would\r\nquarter his ground. He seemed to have observed that he most frequently\r\nfound his game in the course of this circuit. [25]\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson gives the following characteristic sketches of the different\r\nbreeds of pointer:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH POINTER,\r\n\r\noriginally a native of Spain, was once considered to be a valuable dog.\r\nHe stood higher on his legs, but was too large and heavy in his limbs,\r\nand had widely spread, ugly feet, exposing him to frequent lameness. His\r\nmuzzle and head were large, corresponding with the acuteness of his\r\nsmell. His ears were large and pendent, and his body ill-formed. He was\r\nnaturally an ill-tempered dog, growling at the hand that would caress\r\nhim, even although it were his master's. He stood steadily to his birds;\r\nbut it was difficult to break him of chasing the hare. He was deficient\r\nin speed. His redeeming quality was his excellent scent, unequalled in\r\nany other kind of dog.\r\n\r\n[To convince our readers of the value of this particular breed, we may\r\nmention the very singular sale of Colonel Thornton's dog Dash, who was\r\npurchased by Sir Richard Symons for one hundred and sixty pounds worth\r\nof champagne and burgundy, a hogshead of of claret, and an elegant gun\r\nand another pointer, with a stipulation that if any accident befell the\r\ndog, he was to be returned to his former owner for fifty guineas. Dash\r\nunfortunately broke his leg, and in accordance with the agreement of\r\nsale was returned to the Colonel, who considered him a fortunate\r\nacquisition as a stallion to breed from. (See Blain or Daniel).--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTUGESE POINTER,\r\n\r\nalthough with a slighter form than the Spanish one, is defective in the\r\nfeet, often crooked in the legs, and of a quarrelsome disposition. He\r\nsoon tires, and is much inclined to chase the hare. The tail is larger\r\nthan that of the spaniel, and fully fringed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH POINTER\r\n\r\nis distinguished by a furrow between his nostrils, which materially\r\ninterferes with the acuteness of smell. He is better formed and more\r\nactive than either the Spanish or Portugese dog, and capable of longer\r\ncontinued exertion; but he is apt to be quarrelsome, and is too fond of\r\nchasing the hare.\r\n\r\n[We will close this account of the Pointer by transferring from the\r\npages of the \"Spirit of the Times\" our remarks upon this particular\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\nThe French variety, as described by English authors, is much smaller\r\nthan either of the above breeds; and although possessed of great beauty,\r\nacute scent, and other qualifications that would render him valuable in\r\ntheir eyes, still is considered much inferior, not being able to cope\r\nwith their dogs in hunting, owing to a want of physical power of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nYouatt states, that he is distinguished by a furrow in his nose, which\r\nmaterially interferes with his acuteness of smell.\r\n\r\nThese accounts do not agree with the French writers, to whom, it is very\r\ntrue, the English should not look for any particular information\r\nrespecting hunting or shooting. Nevertheless, all must admit that they\r\nare quite as capable of describing their particular breeds of animals as\r\nother nations; and, in fact, we might go farther, and say that they are\r\nmuch more competent to the task than English writers, judging from their\r\nextensive knowledge in comparative anatomy, and their long array of\r\ncelebrated writers on natural history--the Cuviers, Buffon, &c.\r\n\r\n'Baudrillart', in his 'Dictionnaire des Chases', describes the French\r\nPointer as having endurance and great industry, and of their being used\r\noftentimes solely for 'la grande chasse'. In the atlas of plates\r\naccompanying this interesting work, will be found two distinct and\r\nextremely correct drawings of the English Pointer, and also an engraving\r\nof the French variety, which latter, certainly, is represented as being\r\nequally, if not more muscular and and hardy, than the English.\r\n\r\nAs for the furrow in the nose, as mentioned by Youatt, no reference is\r\nmade to it in connection with this species, and in the engraving the\r\nnose is square. But in describing another variety, known in France as\r\ncoming from Spain, 'Baudrillart' states, that they are vulgarly called\r\n\"à deux nez, parceque ce chien a les narines separées par une gouttiere.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Youatt's declaration in reference to the furrow in the nose\r\n\"materially interfering with the acuteness of smell,\" I cannot\r\nunderstand how, or on what principle of reasoning, this slight deviation\r\nfrom nature should affect the properties of the olfactory apparatus.\r\nThat these furrow-nosed dogs are inferior to the English in scenting\r\npowers, as stated by Mr. Youatt, we do not question; but that their\r\ndeficiency depends upon this furrow, remains to be proved.\r\n\r\nThis furrow in the nose is merely a deformity, and like many others in\r\nvarious breeds of animals, was solely the result of accident in the\r\nfirst place; and as we often see, even in the human species, the\r\ndeformities and infirmities of our ancestors entailed upon their\r\nprogeny, so has this 'cut in the nose' been so extensively inherited by\r\nsucceeding generations, that it has now become a distinctive mark of a\r\nwhole class of dogs.\r\n\r\nThe French Pointer, as known in this country, is a beautiful,\r\nwell-shaped, compact, square-nosed dog; not so long or high as the\r\nEnglish, but extremely well built, full-chested, large head, pendent\r\nears, projecting eyes, large feet, and thickish tail. His colour, seldom\r\nwhite, but generally intermingled with small spots of brown or chocolate\r\nover the body, and more particularly over the head and ears. Such a dog\r\nis in the possession of the writer, who knows nothing of his ancestry;\r\nbut is convinced from those he saw in France, that they must have been\r\nimported from that country.\r\n\r\nThe English Pointer will now claim more particularly our attention. It\r\nis quite useless to go into a general description of an animal of whom\r\nwe have already said much, and with whom we are all familiar; but we\r\nwill endeavour to mention the most striking points of the species, which\r\nmarks can be referred to as guides in the purchase of a dog.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult matter to put on paper, in a manner satisfactory\r\neither to the reader or writer, the peculiarities of any animal, whereby\r\nhe may be judged pure or mixed. However, there are, generally, some few\r\npoints in each species, that can be selected as proofs of their\r\ngenuineness and ability to perform certain actions peculiar to the race.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, more reliance must be placed upon the good faith of the\r\nseller, or the previous knowledge of the strain from which the purchaser\r\nselects--and what is better than either, from actual observation in the\r\nfield; all of which precautions may, nevertheless, prove abortive, and\r\nour dog be worthless.\r\n\r\nAs regards the size of the English Pointer, we may say, that he averages\r\nin length about 3 feet from the tip of the muzzle to the base of the\r\ntail, and from 22 to 26 inches high. His head not bulky nor too narrow,\r\nthe frontal sinuses largely developed.\r\n\r\nThe muzzle long and rather tapering, the nostrils large and well open,\r\nthe ear slightly erect, not over long, and the tip triangular; if too\r\npendent, large and rounded at the tip, there is too much of the hound\r\npresent. The eyes lively, but not too prominent; the neck rather long\r\nand not over thick, the chest broad, the limbs large and muscular; the\r\npaws strong, hard and wide. The body and loins thin, rather than bulky,\r\nthe hind quarters broad, and the limbs in the same proportion with the\r\nfore members; the tail long and tapering.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN POINTER\r\n\r\nis a rough, ill-tempered animal, with too much tendency to stupidity,\r\nand often annoyed by vermin. He runs awkwardly, with his nose near the\r\nground, and frequently springs his game. He also has the cloven or\r\ndivided nose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY TRAINING OF THE DOG.\r\n\r\nThe education of these dogs should commence at an early period, whether\r\nconducted by the breeder or the sportsman; and the first lesson--that on\r\nwhich the value of the animal, and the pleasure of its owner, will much\r\ndepend--is a habit of subjection on the part of the dog, and kindness on\r\nthe part of the master. This is a 'sine quâ non'. The dog must recognise\r\nin his owner a friend and a benefactor. This will soon establish in the\r\nmind of the quadruped a feeling of gratitude, and a desire to please.\r\nAll this is natural to the dog, if he is encouraged by the master, and\r\nthen the process of breaking-in may commence in good earnest.\r\n\r\nNo long time probably passes ere the dog commits some little fault. He\r\nis careless, or obstinate, or cross. The owner puts on a serious\r\ncountenance, he holds up his finger, or shakes his head, or produces the\r\nwhip, and threatens to use it. Perhaps the infliction of a blow, that\r\nbreaks no bones, occasionally follows. In the majority of cases nothing\r\nmore is required. The dog succumbs; he asks to be forgiven; or, if he\r\nhas been self-willed, he may be speedily corrected without any serious\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nA writer, under the signature of \"Soho,\" in The New Sporting Magazine\r\nfor 1833, gives an interesting account of the schooling of the pointer\r\nor setter, thus commenced. A short abstract from it may not be\r\nunacceptable:\r\n\r\n  \"The first lesson inculcated is that of passive obedience, and this\r\n  enforced by the infliction of severity as little as the case will\r\n  admit. We will suppose the dog to be a setter. He is taken into the\r\n  garden or into a field, and a strong cord, about eighteen or twenty\r\n  yards long, is tied to his collar. The sportsman calls the dog to him,\r\n  looks earnestly at him, gently presses him to the ground, and several\r\n  times, with a loud, but not an angry voice, says, 'Down!' or 'Down\r\n  charge!' The dog knows not the meaning of this, and struggles to get\r\n  up; but, as often as he struggles, the cry of 'Down charge!' is\r\n  repeated, and the pressure is continued or increased.\r\n\r\n  \"This is repeated a longer or shorter time, until the dog, finding\r\n  that no harm is meant, quietly submits. He is then permitted to rise;\r\n  he is patted and caressed, and some food is given to him. The command\r\n  to rise is also introduced by the terms 'Hie up!' A little afterwards\r\n  the same process is repeated, and he struggles less, or perhaps ceases\r\n  altogether to struggle.\r\n\r\n  \"The person whose circumstances permit him occasionally to shoot over\r\n  his little demesne, may very readily educate his dog without having\r\n  recourse to keepers or professional breakers, among whom he would\r\n  often be subject to imposition. Generally speaking, no dog is half so\r\n  well broken as the one whose owner has taken the trouble of training\r\n  him. The first and grand thing is to obtain the attachment of the dog,\r\n  by frequently feeding and caressing him, and giving him little hours\r\n  of liberty under his own inspection; but, every now and then,\r\n  inculcating a lesson of obedience, teaching him that every gambol must\r\n  be under the control of his master; frequently checking him in the\r\n  midst of his riot with the order of 'Down charge!' patting him when he\r\n  is instantly obedient; and rating, or castigating him, but not too\r\n  severely, when there is any reluctance to obey. 'Passive obedience\r\n  is the first principle, and from which no deviation should be\r\n  allowed.' [26]\r\n\r\n  \"Much kindness and gentleness are certainly requisite when breaking-in\r\n  the puppy, whether it be a pointer or a setter. There is heedlessness\r\n  in the young dog which is not readily got rid of until age has given\r\n  him experience. He must not, however, be too severely corrected, or he\r\n  may be spoiled for life. If considerable correction is sometimes\r\n  necessary, it should be followed, at a little distance of time, by\r\n  some kind usage. The memory of the suffering will remain; but the\r\n  feeling of attachment to the master will also remain, or rather be\r\n  increased. The temper of a young dog must be almost as carefully\r\n  studied as that of a human being. Timidity may be encouraged, and\r\n  eagerness may be restrained, but affection must be the tie that binds\r\n  him to his master, and renders him subservient to his will.\r\n\r\n  \"The next portion of the lesson is more difficult to learn. He is no\r\n  longer held by his master, but suffered to run over the field,\r\n  seemingly at his pleasure, when, suddenly, comes the warning 'Down!'\r\n  He perhaps pays no attention to it, but gambols along until seized by\r\n  his master, forced on the ground, and the order of 'Down!' somewhat\r\n  sternly uttered.\r\n\r\n  \"After a while he is suffered again to get up. He soon forgets what\r\n  has occurred, and gallops away with as much glee as ever. Again the\r\n  'Down!' is heard, and again little or no attention is paid to it. His\r\n  master once more lays hold of him and forces him on the ground, and\r\n  perhaps inflicts a slight blow or two, and this process continues\r\n  until the dog finds that he must obey the command of 'Down charge!'\r\n\r\n  \"The owner will now probably walk from him a little way backward with\r\n  his hand lifted up. If the dog makes the slightest motion, he must be\r\n  sharply spoken to, and the order peremptorily enforced.\r\n\r\n  \"He must then be taught to 'back,' that is, to come behind his master\r\n  when called. When he seems to understand all this, he is called by his\r\n  master in a kindly tone, and patted and caressed. It is almost\r\n  incredible how soon he will afterwards understand what he is ordered\r\n  to do, and perform it.\r\n\r\n  \"It will be seen by this that no one should attempt to break-in a dog\r\n  who is not possessed of patience and perseverance. The sportsman must\r\n  not expect to see a great deal of improvement from the early lessons.\r\n  The dog will often forget that which was inculcated upon him a few\r\n  hours before; but perseverance and kindness will effect much: the\r\n  first lessons over, the dog, beginning to perceive a little what is\r\n  meant, will cheerfully and joyfully do his duty.\r\n\r\n  \"When there is much difficulty in teaching the dog his lesson, the\r\n  fault lies as often with the master as with him; or they are,\r\n  generally speaking, both in fault. Some dogs cannot be mastered but by\r\n  means of frequent correction. The less the sportsman has to do with\r\n  them the better. Others will not endure the least correction, but\r\n  become either ferocious or sulky. They should be disposed of as soon\r\n  as possible. The majority of dogs are exceedingly sagacious. They\r\n  possess strong reasoning powers; they understand, by intuition, almost\r\n  every want and wish of their master, and they deserve the kindest and\r\n  best usage.\r\n\r\n  \"The scholar being thus prepared, should be taken into the field,\r\n  either alone, or, what is considerably better, with a well-trained,\r\n  steady dog. When the old dog makes a point, the master calls out,\r\n  'Down!' or 'Soho!' and holds up his hand, and approaches steadily to\r\n  the birds; and, if the young one runs in or prepares to do so, as\r\n  probably he will at first, he again raises his hand and calls out,\r\n  'Soho!' If the youngster pays no attention to this, the whip must be\r\n  used, and in a short time he will be steady enough at the first\r\n  intimation of game.\r\n\r\n  \"If he springs any birds without taking notice of them, he should be\r\n  dragged to the spot from which they rose, and, 'Soho!' being cried,\r\n  one or two sharp strokes with the whip should be inflicted. If he is\r\n  too eager, he should be warned to 'take heed.' If he 'rakes' or runs\r\n  with his nose near the ground, he should be admonished to 'hold up',\r\n  and, if he still persists, the 'muzzle-peg' may be resorted to. Some\r\n  persons fire over the dog for running at hares: but this is wrong;\r\n  for, besides the danger of wounding or even killing the animal, he\r\n  will for some time afterwards he frightened at the sound, or even at\r\n  the very sight of a gun. The best plan to accustom dogs to the gun, is\r\n  occasionally to fire one off when they are being fed.\r\n\r\n  \"Some persons let their dog fetch the dead birds. This is very wrong.\r\n  Except the sportsman has a double-barrelled gun, the dog should not be\r\n  suffered to move until the piece is again charged. The young one,\r\n  until he is thoroughly broken of it, is too apt to run in whether the\r\n  bird is killed or not, and which may create much mischief by\r\n  disturbing the game.\r\n\r\n  \"Although excessive punishment should not be administered, yet no\r\n  fault, however small, should pass without reproof: on the other hand,\r\n  he should be rewarded, but not too lavishly, for every instance of\r\n  good conduct.\r\n\r\n  \"When the dog is grown tolerably steady, and taught to come at the\r\n  call, he should also learn to range and quarter his ground. Let some\r\n  clear morning, and some place where the sportsman is likely to meet\r\n  with game, be selected. Station him where the wind will blow in his\r\n  face; wave your hand and cry, 'Heigh on, good dog!' Then let him go\r\n  off to the right, about seventy or eighty yards. After this, call him\r\n  in by another wave of the hand, and let him go the same distance to\r\n  the left. Walk straight forward with your eye always upon him; then,\r\n  let him continue to cross from right to left, calling him in at the\r\n  limit of each range.\r\n\r\n  \"This is at first a somewhat difficult lesson, and requires careful\r\n  teaching. The same ground is never to be twice passed over. The\r\n  sportsman watches every motion, and the dog is never trusted out of\r\n  sight, or allowed to break fence. When this lesson is tolerably\r\n  learned, and on some good scenting morning early in the season, he may\r\n  take the field, and perhaps find. Probably he will be too eager, and\r\n  spring his game. Make him 'down' immediately, and take him to the\r\n  place where the birds rose. Chide him with 'Steady!' 'How dare you!'\r\n  Use no whip; but scold him well, and be assured that he will be more\r\n  cautious. If possible, kill on the next chance. The moment the bird is\r\n  down, he will probably rush in and seize it. He must be met with the\r\n  same rebuff, 'Down charge!' If he does not obey, he deserves to have,\r\n  and will have, a stroke with the whip. The gun being again charged,\r\n  the bird is sought for, and the dog is suffered to see it and play\r\n  with it for a minute before it is put into the bag.\r\n\r\n  \"He will now become thoroughly fond of the sport, and his fondness\r\n  will increase with each bird that is killed. At every time, however,\r\n  whether he kills or misses, the sportsman should make the dog 'Down\r\n  charge.' and never allow him to rise until he has loaded.\r\n\r\n  \"If a hare should be wounded, there will, occasionally, be\r\n  considerable difficulty in preventing him from chasing her. The best\r\n  broken and steadiest dog cannot always be restrained from running\r\n  hares. He must be checked with 'Ware chase,' and, if he does not\r\n  attend, the sportsman must wait patiently. He will by-and-by come\r\n  slinking along with his tail between his legs, conscious of his fault.\r\n  It is one, however, that admits of no pardon. He must be secured, and,\r\n  while the field echoes with the cry of 'Ware chase,' he must be\r\n  punished to a certain but not too great extent. The castigation must\r\n  be repeated as often as he offends; or, if there is much difficulty in\r\n  breaking him of the habit, he must be got rid of.\"\r\n\r\nThe breaking-in or subjugation of pointers and setters is a very\r\nimportant, and occasionally a difficult affair; the pleasure of the\r\nsportsman, however, depends on it. The owner of any considerable\r\nproperty will naturally look to his keeper to furnish him with dogs on\r\nwhich he may depend, and he ought not to be disappointed; for those\r\nwhich belong to other persons, or are brought at the beginning of the\r\nseason, whatever account the breaker or the keeper of them may give,\r\nwill too often be found deficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OTTER HOUND\r\n\r\nused to be of a mingled breed, between the southern hound and the rough\r\nterrier, and in size between the harrier and the fox-hound. The head\r\nshould be large and broad, the shoulders and quarters thick, and the\r\nhair strong, wiry, and rough. They used to be kept in small packs, for\r\nthe express purpose of hunting the otter.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and fifty years ago, otter-hunting was a favourite amusement\r\nin several parts of Great Britain. Many of our streams then abounded\r\nwith this destructive animal; but, since the population are more\r\nnumerous, and many contrivances are adopted to ensnare and destroy\r\notters, few are now to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURNSPIT\r\n\r\nThis dog was once a valuable auxiliary in the kitchen, by turning the\r\nspit before jacks were invented. It had a peculiar length of body, with\r\nshort crooked legs, the tail curled, its ears long and pendent, and the\r\nhead large in proportion to the body. It is still used in the kitchen on\r\nvarious parts of the Continent. There are some curious stories of the\r\nartfulness with which he often attempted to avoid the task imposed upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of this dog; the crooked-legged turnspit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'Historical and Descriptive Sketches of British America',\r\nby J.

He should\r\n  be sensible, good-tempered, sober, exact, and cleanly--a good groom\r\n  and an excellent horseman. His voice should be strong and clear, with\r\n  an eye so quick as to perceive which of his hounds carries the scent\r\n  when all are running, and an ear so excellent as to distinguish the\r\n  leading hounds when he does not see them. He should be quiet, patient,\r\n  and without conceit. Such are the qualities which constitute\r\n  perfection in a huntsman. He should not, however, be too fond of\r\n  displaying them until called forth by necessity; it being a peculiar\r\n  and distinguishing trait in his character to let his hounds alone\r\n  while they thus hunt, and have genius to assist them when they\r\n  cannot.\"\r\n\r\n'Beckford on Hunting', Letter ix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: 'Blaine on the Diseases of the Dog', p. 140.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: See 'Hints to Young Masters of Fox-Hounds'--'New Sport.\r\nMag.', vol. viii. p. 174-290.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: 'Traité de la Folie dex Animaux', tom. ii. 39.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Mr. D. Radcliffe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The late Lord Oxford reduced four stags to so perfect a\r\ndegree of submission that, in his short excursions, he used to drive\r\nthem in a phaeton made for the purpose. He was one day exercising his\r\nsingular and beautiful steeds in the neighbourhood of Newmarket, when\r\ntheir ears were saluted with the unwelcome cry of a pack of hounds,\r\nwhich, crossing the road in their rear, had caught the scent, and\r\nleaving their original object of pursuit, were now in rapid chase of the\r\nfrightened stags. In vain his grooms exerted themselves to the utmost,\r\nthe terrified animals bounded away with the swiftness of lightning, and\r\nentered Newmarket at full speed. They made immediately for the Ram Inn,\r\nto which his lordship was in the habit of driving, and, having\r\nfortunately entered the yard without any accident, the stable-keepers\r\nhuddled his lordship, the phaeton, and the deer into a large barn, just\r\nin time to save them from the hounds, who came into the yard in full cry\r\na few seconds afterwards.\r\n\r\n('Annals of Sporting', vol. iii. 1833.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: The author of the 'Field Book' says that he saw an\r\nextremely small pointer, whose length, from the tip of the nose to the\r\npoint of the tail, was only two feet and half an inch, the length of the\r\nhead being six inches, and round the chest one foot and three inches. He\r\nwas an exquisite miniature of the English pointer, being in all respects\r\nsimilar to him, except in his size. His colour was white, with dark\r\nliver-coloured patches on each side of the head, extending half down the\r\nneck. The ears, with some patches on the back, were also of the same\r\ncolour, and numerous small dark-brown spots appeared over his whole body\r\nand legs.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful little animal had an exquisite sense of smell. Some of\r\nthe same breed, and being the property of the Earl of Lauderdale, were\r\nbroken-in and made excellent pointers, although, from their minute size,\r\nit could not be expected that they would be able to do much work. When\r\nintent upon any object, the dog assumed the same attitude as other\r\npointers, holding up one of his feet.\r\n\r\n('The Field Book', p. 399.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Another writer in the same volume gives also an\r\ninteresting account of the management of the setter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE VARIETIES OF THE DOG.\r\n\r\nTHIRD DIVISION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'The muzzle more or less shortened, the frontal sinus enlarged, and\r\n  the cranium elevated and diminished in capacity.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the head of this inferior or brutal division of dogs stands\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BULL-DOG.\r\n\r\nThe round, thick head, turned-up nose, and thick and pendulous lips of\r\nthis dog are familiar to all, while his ferocity makes him in the\r\nhighest degree dangerous. In general he makes a silent although\r\nferocious attack, and the persisting powers of his teeth and jaws enable\r\nhim to keep his hold against any but the greatest efforts, so that the\r\nutmost mischief is likely to ensue as well to the innocent visitor of\r\nhis domicile as the ferocious intruder. The bull-dog is scarcely capable\r\nof any education, and is fitted for nothing but ferocity and combat.\r\n\r\nThe name of this dog is derived from his being too often employed, until\r\na few years ago, in baiting the bull. It was practised by the low and\r\ndissolute in many parts of the country. Dogs were bred and trained for\r\nthe purpose; and, while many of them were injured or destroyed, the head\r\nof the bull was lacerated in the most barbarous manner. Nothing can\r\nexceed the fury with which the bull-dog rushed on his foe, and the\r\nobstinacy with which he maintained his hold. He fastened upon the lip,\r\nthe muzzle, or the eye, and there he hung in spite of every effort of\r\nthe bull to free himself from his antagonist.\r\n\r\nBull-dogs are not so numerous as they were a few years ago; and every\r\nkind-hearted person will rejoice to hear that bull-baiting is now put\r\ndown by legal authority in every part of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BULL TERRIER.\r\n\r\nThis dog is a cross between the bull-dog and the terrier, and is\r\ngenerally superior, both in appearance and value, to either of its\r\nprogenitors. A second cross considerably lessens the underhanging of the\r\nlower jaw, and a third entirely removes it, retaining the spirit and\r\ndetermination of the animal. It forms a steadier friendship than either\r\nof them, and the principal objection to it is its love of wanton\r\nmischief, and the dangerous irascibility which it occasionally exhibits.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, a warm friend of dogs, and whose veracity cannot be\r\nimpeached, gives an interesting account of a favourite one belonging to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n  \"The cleverest dog I ever had was what is called a bull-dog terrier. I\r\n  taught him to understand a great many words, insomuch that I am\r\n  positive the communication between the canine species and ourselves\r\n  might be greatly enlarged. Camp, the name of my dog, once bit the\r\n  baker when bringing bread to the family. I beat him, and explained the\r\n  enormity of the offence; after which, to the last moment of his life,\r\n  he never heard the least allusion to the story without creeping into\r\n  the darkest corner of the room. Towards the end of his life when he\r\n  was unable to attend me while I was on horseback, he generally watched\r\n  for my return, and, when the servant used to tell him, his master was\r\n  coming down the hill, or through the moor, although he did not use any\r\n  gesture to explain his meaning, Camp was never known to mistake him,\r\n  but either went out at the front to go up the hill, or at the back to\r\n  get down to the moor-side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASTIFF\r\n\r\nThe head considerably resembles that of the bull-dog, but with the ears\r\ndependent. The upper lip falls over the lower jaw. The end of the tail\r\nis turned up, and frequently the fifth toe of the hind feet is more or\r\nless developed. The nostrils are separated one from another by a deep\r\nfurrow. He has a grave and somewhat sullen countenance, and his\r\ndeep-toned bark is often heard during the night. The mastiff is taller\r\nthan the bull-dog, but not so deep in the chest, and his head is large\r\ncompared with his general form.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the mastiff is an original breed peculiar to the\r\nBritish islands.\r\n\r\nHe seems to be fully aware of the impression which his large size makes\r\non every stranger; and, in the night especially, he watches the abode of\r\nhis master with the completest vigilance; in fact, nothing would tempt\r\nhim to betray the confidence which is reposed in him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Brown states that,\r\n\r\n  \"notwithstanding his commanding appearance and the strictness with\r\n  which he guards the property of his master, he is possessed of the\r\n  greatest mildness of conduct, and is as grateful for any favours\r\n  bestowed upon him as is the most diminutive of the canine tribe. There\r\n  is a remarkable and peculiar warmth in his attachments. He is aware of\r\n  all the duties required of him, and he punctually discharges them. In\r\n  the course of the night he several times examines every thing with\r\n  which he is intrusted with the most scrupulous care, and, by repeated\r\n  barkings, warns the household or the depredator that he is at the post\r\n  of duty.\" [1]\r\n\r\nThe mastiff from Cuba requires some mention, and will call up some of\r\nthe most painful recollections in the history of the human race. He was\r\nnot a native of Cuba, but imported into the country.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards had possessed themselves of several of the South American\r\nislands. They found them peopled with Indians, and those of a sensual,\r\nbrutish, and barbarous class--continually making war with their\r\nneighbours, indulging in an irreconcilable hatred of the Spaniards, and\r\ndetermined to expel and destroy them. In self-defence, they were driven\r\nto some means of averting the destruction with which they were\r\nthreatened. They procured some of these mastiffs, by whose assistance\r\nthey penetrated into every part of the country, and destroyed the\r\ngreater portion of the former inhabitants.\r\n\r\nLas Casas, a Catholic priest, and whose life was employed in\r\nendeavouring to mitigate the sufferings of the original inhabitants,\r\nsays that\r\n\r\n  \"it was resolved to march against the Indians, who had fled to the\r\n  mountains, and they were chased like wild beasts, with the assistance\r\n  of bloodhounds, who had been trained to a thirst for human blood, so\r\n  that before I had left the island it had become almost entirely a\r\n  desert.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ICELAND DOG.\r\n\r\nThe head is rounder than that of the northern dogs; the ears partly\r\nerect and partly pendent; and the fur soft and long, especially behind\r\nthe fore legs and on the tail. It much resembles the Turkish dog removed\r\nto a colder climate.\r\n\r\nThis dog is exceedingly useful to the Icelanders while travelling over\r\nthe snowy deserts of the north. By a kind of intuition he rarely fails\r\nin choosing the shortest and the safest course. He also is more aware\r\nthan his master of the approach of the snow storms; and is a most\r\nvaluable ally against the attack of the Polar bear, who, drifted on\r\nmasses of ice from the neighbouring continent, often commits\r\ndepredations among the cattle, and even attacks human beings. When the\r\ndog is first aware of the neighbourhood of the bear, he sets up a\r\nfearful howl, and men and dogs hasten to hunt down and destroy the\r\ndepredator.\r\n\r\nThe travelling in Iceland is sometimes exceedingly dangerous at the\r\nbeginning of the winter. A thin layer of snow covers and conceals some\r\nof the chasms with which that region abounds. Should the traveller fall\r\ninto one of them, the dog proves a most useful animal; for he runs\r\nimmediately across the snowy waste, and, by his howling, induces the\r\ntraveller's friends to hasten to his rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERRIER\r\n\r\nThe forehead is convex; the eye prominent; the muzzle pointed; the tail\r\nthin and arched; the fur short; the ears of moderate size, half erect,\r\nand usually of a deep-black colour, with a yellow spot over the eyes. It\r\nis an exceedingly useful animal; but not so indispensable an\r\naccompaniment to a pack of fox-hounds as it used to be accounted. Foxes\r\nare not so often unearthed as they formerly were, yet many a day's sport\r\nwould be lost without the terrier. Some sportsmen used to have two\r\nterriers accompanying in the pack, one being smaller than the other.\r\nThis was a very proper provision; a large terrier might be incapable of\r\npenetrating into the earth, and a small one might permit the escape of\r\nthe prey. Many terriers have lost their lives by scratching up the earth\r\nbehind them, and thus depriving themselves of all means of retreat.\r\n\r\nThe coat of the terrier may be either smooth or rough; the smooth-haired\r\nones are more delicate in appearance, and are somewhat more exposed to\r\ninjury or accident; but in courage, sagacity, and strength, there is\r\nvery little difference if the dogs are equally well bred. The rough\r\nterrier possibly obtained his shaggy coat from the cur, and the smooth\r\nterrier may derive his from the hound.\r\n\r\nThe terrier is seldom of much service until he is twelve months old; and\r\nthen, incited by natural propensity, or the example of the older ones,\r\nor urged on by the huntsman, he begins to discharge his supposed duty.\r\n\r\nAn old terrier is brought to the mouth of the earth in which a vixen\r\nfox--a fox with her young ones--has taken up her abode, and is sent in\r\nto worry and drive her out. Some young terriers are brought to the mouth\r\nof the hover, to listen to the process that is going forward within, and\r\nto be excited to the utmost extent of which they are capable. The vixen\r\nis at length driven out, and caught at the mouth of the hole; and the\r\nyoung ones are suffered to rush in, and worry or destroy their first\r\nprey. They want no after-tuition to prepare them for the discharge of\r\ntheir duty.\r\n\r\nThis may be pardoned. It is the most ready way of training the young dog\r\nto his future business; but it is hoped that no reader of this work will\r\nbe guilty of the atrocities that are often practised. An old fox, or\r\nbadger, is caught, his under jaw is sawn off, and the lower teeth are\r\nforcibly extracted, or broken. A hole is then dug in the earth, or a\r\nbarrel is placed large and deep enough to permit a terrier, or perhaps\r\ntwo of them, to enter. Into this cavity the fox or badger is thrust, and\r\na terrier rushes after him, and drags him out again. The question to be\r\nascertained is, how many times in a given period the dog will draw this\r\npoor tortured animal out of the barrel--an exhibition of cruelly which\r\nno one should be able to lay to the charge of any human being. It is a\r\nprinciple not to be departed from, that wanton and useless barbarity\r\nshould never be permitted. The government, to a certain extent, has\r\ninterfered, and a noble society has been established to limit, or, if\r\npossible, to prevent the infliction of useless pain.\r\n\r\nThe terrier is, however, a valuable dog, in the house and the farm. The\r\nstoat, the pole-cat, and the weazel, commit great depredations in the\r\nfields, the barn, and granary; and to a certain extent, the terrier is\r\nemployed in chasing them; but it is not often that he has a fair chance\r\nto attack them. He is more frequently used in combating the rat.\r\n\r\nThe mischief effected by rats is almost incredible. It has been said\r\nthat, in some cases, in the article of corn, these animals consume a\r\nquantity of food equal in value to the rent of the farm. Here the dog is\r\nusefully employed, and in his very element, especially if there is a\r\ncross of the bull-dog about him.\r\n\r\nThere are some extraordinary accounts of the dexterity, as well as\r\ncourage, of the terrier in destroying rats. The feats of a dog called\r\n\"Billy\" will he long remembered. He was matched to destroy one hundred\r\nlarge rats in eight and a half minutes. The rats were brought into the\r\nring in bags, and, as soon as the number was complete, he was put over\r\nthe railing. In six minutes and thirty-five seconds they were all\r\ndestroyed. In another match he destroyed the same number in six minutes\r\nand thirteen seconds. At length, when he was getting old, and had but\r\ntwo teeth and one eye left, a wager was laid of thirty sovereigns, by\r\nthe owner of a Berkshire bitch, that she would kill fifty rats in less\r\ntime than Billy. The old dog killed his fifty in five minutes and six\r\nseconds. The pit was then cleared, and the bitch let in. When she had\r\nkilled thirty rats, she was completely exhausted, fell into a fit, and\r\nlay barking and yelping, utterly incapable of completing her task.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the terrier is very great. One has been known to run six\r\nmiles in thirty-two minutes. He needs to be a fleet dog if, with his\r\ncomparatively little bulk, he can keep up with the foxhound.\r\n\r\nA small breed of 'wry-legged' terriers was once in repute, and, to a\r\ncertain degree, is retained for the purpose of hunting rabbits. It\r\nprobably originated in some rickety specimens, remarkable for the slow\r\ndevelopment of their frame, except in the head, the belly, and the\r\njoints, which enlarge at the expense of the other parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTCH TERRIER\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that this dog is far older than the English\r\nterrier. There are three varieties: first the common Scotch terrier,\r\ntwelve or thirteen inches high; his body muscular and compact--\r\nconsiderable breadth across the loins--the legs shorter and stouter than\r\nthose of the English terriers. The head large in proportion to the size\r\nof the body--the muzzle small and pointed--strong marks of intelligence\r\nin the countenance--warm attachment to his master, and the evident\r\ndevotion of every power to the fulfilment of his wishes. The hair is\r\nlong and tough, and extending over the whole of the frame. In colour,\r\nthey are black or fawn: the white, yellow, or pied are always deficient\r\nin purity of blood.\r\n\r\nAnother species has nearly the same conformation, but is covered with\r\nlonger, more curly, and stouter hair; the legs being apparently, but not\r\nactually, shorter. This kind of dog prevails in the greater part of the\r\nWestern Islands of Scotland, and some of them, where the hair has\r\nobtained its full development, are much admired.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty had one from Islay, a faithful and affectionate creature,\r\nyet with all the spirit and determination that belongs to his breed. The\r\nwriter of this account had occasion to operate on this poor fellow, who\r\nhad been bitten under somewhat suspicious circumstances. He submitted\r\nwithout a cry or a struggle, and seemed to be perfectly aware that we\r\nshould not put him to pain without having some good purpose in view.\r\n\r\nA third species of terrier is of a considerably larger bulk, and three\r\nor four inches taller than either of the others. Its hair is shorter\r\nthan that of the other breeds, and is hard and wiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHOCK-DOG\r\n\r\nis traced by Buffon, but somewhat erroneously, to a mixture of the small\r\nDanish dog and the pug. The head is round, the eyes large, but somewhat\r\nconcealed by its long and curly hair, the tail curved and bent forward.\r\nThe muzzle resembles that of the pug. It is of small size, and is used\r\nin this country and on the Continent as a lap-dog. It is very properly\r\ndescribed by the author of \"The Field Book\" as a useless little animal,\r\nseeming to possess no other quality than that of a faithful attachment\r\nto his mistress.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTOIS DOG\r\n\r\nwith his short, flat muzzle, is a produce of the shock-dog and the pug.\r\nHe has nothing peculiar to recommend him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANDALUSIAN, OR ALICANT DOG,\r\n\r\n\r\nhas the short muzzle of the pug with the long hair of the spaniel.\r\n\r\nTHE EGYPTIAN AND BARBARY DOG,\r\n\r\naccording to Cuvier, has a very thick and round head, the ears erect at\r\nthe base, large and movable, and carried horizontally, the skin nearly\r\nnaked, and black or dark flesh-colour, with large patches of brown. A\r\nsub-variety has a kind of mane behind the head, formed of long stiff\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\nBuffon imagines that the shepherd's dog--transported to different\r\nclimates, and acquiring different habits--was the ancestor of the\r\nvarious species with which almost every country abounds; but whence they\r\noriginally came it is impossible to say. They vary in their size, their\r\ncolour, their attitude, their usual exterior, and their strangely\r\ndifferent interior construction. Transported into various climates, they\r\nare necessarily submitted to the influence of heat and cold, and of food\r\nmore or less abundant and more or less suitable to their natural\r\norganization; but the reason or the derivation of these differences of\r\nstructure it is not always easy to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Brown's 'Biographical Sketches', p. 425.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD QUALITIES OF THE DOG; THE SENSE OF SMELL; INTELLIGENCE; MORAL\r\nQUALITIES; DOG-CARTS; CROPPING; TAILING; BREAKING-IN; DOG-PITS;\r\nDOG-STEALING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our history of the different breeds of the dog we have seen enough to\r\ninduce us to admire and love him. His courage, his fidelity, and the\r\ndegree in which he often devotes every power that he possesses to our\r\nservice, are circumstances that we can never forget nor overlook. His\r\nvery foibles occasionally attach him to us. We may select a pointer for\r\nthe pureness of his blood and the perfection of his education. He\r\ntransgresses in the field. We call him to us; we scold him well;\r\nperchance, we chastise him. He lies motionless and dumb at our feet. The\r\npunishment being over, he gets up, and, by some significant gesture,\r\nacknowledges his consciousness of deserving what he has suffered. The\r\nwriter operated on a pointer bitch for an enlarged cancerous tumour,\r\naccompanied by much inflammation and pain in the surrounding parts. A\r\nword or two of kindness and of caution were all that were necessary,\r\nalthough, in order to prevent accidents, she had been bound securely.\r\nThe flesh quivered as the knife pursued its course--a moan or two\r\nescaped her, but yet she did not struggle; and her first act, after all\r\nwas over, was to lick the operator's hand.\r\n\r\nFrom the combination of various causes, the history of no animal is more\r\ninteresting than that of the dog. First, his intimate association with\r\nman, not only as a valuable protector, but as a constant and faithful\r\ncompanion throughout all the vicissitudes of life. Secondly, from his\r\nnatural endowments, not consisting in the exquisite delicacy of one\r\nindividual sense--not merely combining memory with reflection--but\r\npossessing qualities of the mind that stagger us in the contemplation of\r\nthem, and which we can alone account for in the gradation existing in\r\nthat wonderful system which, by different links of one vast chain,\r\nextends from the first to the last of all things, until it forms a\r\nperfect whole on the wonderful confines of the spiritual and material\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe here quote the beautiful account of Sir Walter Scott and his dogs, as\r\ndescribed by Henry Hallam:\r\n\r\n  \"But looking towards the grassy mound\r\n  Where calm the Douglass chieftains lie,\r\n  Who, living, quiet never found,\r\n  I straightway learnt a lesson high;\r\n\r\n  For there an old man sat serene,\r\n  And well I knew that thoughtful mien\r\n  Of him whose early lyre had thrown\r\n  O'er mouldering walls the magic of its tone.\r\n\r\n  It was a comfort, too, to see\r\n  Those dogs that from him ne'er would rove,\r\n  And always eyed him reverently,\r\n  With glances of depending love.\r\n  They know not of the eminence\r\n  Which marks him to my reasoning sense,\r\n  They know but that he is a man,\r\n  And still to them is kind, and glads them all he can\r\n\r\n  And hence their quiet looks confiding;\r\n  Hence grateful instincts seated deep\r\n  By whose strong bond, were ill betiding,\r\n  They'd lose their own, his life to keep.\r\n  What joy to watch in lower creature\r\n  Such dawning of a moral nature,\r\n  And how (the rule all things obey)\r\n  They look to a higher mind to be their law and stay!\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of the intellectual and moral qualities of the inferior\r\nanimals is one highly interesting and somewhat misunderstood--urged\r\nperhaps to a ridiculous extent by some persons, yet altogether neglected\r\nby others who have no feeling for any but themselves.\r\n\r\nAnatomists have compared the relative bulk of the brain in different\r\nanimals, and the result is not a little interesting. In man the weight\r\nof the brain amounts on the average to 1-30th part of the body. In the\r\nNewfoundland dog it does not amount to 1-60th part, or to 1-100th part\r\nin the poodle and barbet, and not to more than 1-300th part in the\r\nferocious and stupid bull-dog.\r\n\r\nWhen the brain is cut, it is found to be composed of two substances,\r\nessentially different in construction and function--the cortical and the\r\nmedullary. The first is small in quantity, and principally concerned in\r\nthe food and reproduction of the animal, and the cineritious in a great\r\nmeasure the register of the mind. Brute strength seems to be the\r\ncharacter of the former, and superior intelligence of the latter. There\r\nis, comparing bulk with bulk, less of the medullary substance in the\r\nhorse than in the ox--and in the dog than in the horse--and they are\r\ncharacterized as the sluggish ox, the intelligent horse, and the\r\nintellectual and companionable dog.\r\n\r\nFrom the medullary substance proceed certain cords or prolongations,\r\ntermed 'nerves', by which the animal is enabled to receive impressions\r\nfrom surrounding objects and to connect himself with them, and also to\r\npossess many pleasurable or painful sensations. One of them is spread\r\nover the membrane of the nose, and gives the sense of smell; another\r\nexpands on the back of the eye, and the faculty of sight is gained; a\r\nthird goes to the internal structure of the ear and the animal is\r\nconscious of sound. Other nerves, proceeding to different parts, give\r\nthe faculty of motion, while an equally important one bestows the power\r\nof feeling. One division, springing from a prolongation of the brain,\r\nand yet within the skull, wanders to different parts of the frame, for\r\nimportant purposes connected with respiration or breathing. The act of\r\nbreathing is essential to life, and were it to cease, the animal would\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nThere are other nerves--the sympathetic--so called from their union and\r\nsympathy with all the others, and identified with life itself. They\r\nproceed from a small ganglion or enlargement in the upper part of the\r\nneck, or from a collection of minute ganglia within the abdomen. They go\r\nto the heart, and it beats; and to the stomach, and it digests. They\r\nform a net-work round each vessel, and the frame is nourished and built\r\nup. They are destitute of sensation, and they are perfectly beyond the\r\ncontrol of the will.\r\n\r\nWe have been accustomed, and properly, to regard the nervous system, or\r\nthat portion of it which is connected with animal life--that which\r\nrenders us conscious of surrounding objects and susceptible of pleasure\r\nand of pain--as the source of intellectual power and moral feeling. It\r\nis so with ourselves. All our knowledge is derived from our perception\r\nof things around as. A certain impression is made on the outward fibres\r\nof a sensitive nerve. That impression, in some mysterious way, is\r\nconveyed to the brain; and there it is received--registered--stored--and\r\ncompared; there its connections are traced and its consequences\r\nappreciated; and thence a variety of interesting impressions are\r\nconveyed, and due use is made of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SENSE OF SMELL\r\n\r\nOur subject--the intellectual and moral feelings of brutes, and the\r\nmechanism on which they depend--may be divided into two parts, the\r\nportion that receives and conveys, and that which stores up and compares\r\nand uses the impression.\r\n\r\nThe portion that receives and conveys is far more developed in the brute\r\nthan in the human being. Whatever sense we take, we clearly perceive the\r\ntriumph of animal power.\r\n\r\nThe olfactory nerve in the horse, the dog, the ox, and the swine, is the\r\nlargest of all the cerebral nerves, and has much greater comparative\r\nbulk in the quadruped than in the human being. The sense of smell,\r\nbearing proportion to the nerve on which it depends, is yet more acute.\r\nIn man it is connected with pleasure--in the inferior animals with life.\r\nThe relative size of the nerve bears an invariable proportion to the\r\nnecessity of an acute sense of smell in the various animals--large in\r\nthe horse compared with the olfactory nerve in the human being--larger\r\nin the ox, who is often sent into the fields to shift for\r\nhimself--larger still in the swine, whose food is buried under the soil,\r\nor deeply immersed in the filth or refuse,--and still larger in the dog,\r\nthe acuteness of whose scent is so connected with our pleasure.\r\n\r\n[The disposition to hunt by scent is not peculiar to the setter or\r\npointer, but in fact is common to all animals; developing itself in\r\ndifferent proportions according to their various physical constructions\r\nand modes of life. The method of finding and pointing at game, now\r\npeculiar to these dogs, and engendered in their progeny through\r\nsuccessive generations, is not the result of any special instinct, that\r\nusually governs the actions of the brute creation--but rather the effect\r\nof individual education and force of habit upon their several ancestors.\r\nThis habit of life, engrafted through progressive generations into these\r\nbreeds, has become a second nature, and so entirely the property of the\r\nspecies, that all its members, with but little care on the part of man,\r\nwill perform these same actions in the same way, and will ever continue\r\nto exhibit these propensities for hunting, provided opportunities be\r\noffered for indulging them. Nevertheless, as these peculiar\r\npredilections for \"'setting or pointing',\" as before said, are the\r\neffect of education and habit, the artificial impulse would very soon be\r\nentirely obliterated, if not encouraged in the young dogs of each\r\ngeneration. This circumstance alone, proves to us the importance of\r\ngetting dogs from a well-known good strain, whose ancestors have been\r\nremarkable for their exploits in the field. This necessary precaution\r\nwill insure a favourable issue to our troubles, and lessen materially\r\nour labours. In fact young puppies have been frequently known to exhibit\r\nthis propensity the first time they have been taken to the field. Some\r\nof these dogs have come under the notice of the writer, who at a few\r\nmonths old exhibited all the peculiarities of their race; in fact were\r\n\"self-broke.\" These dogs were the progeny of a well-known imported\r\nstock, in the possession of a gentleman who selected them in England.\r\n\r\nAlthough other dogs, and other animals even, have been with great\r\ndifficulty and perseverance taught to find and point game, still these\r\ntwo breeds seem especially adapted by nature, both in their physical and\r\nintellectual construction, for the performance of this particular duty\r\nto man.\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell is differently developed in different animals; the\r\nolfactory nerve of the dog is larger than any other in the cerebrum,\r\nwhich peculiarity will at once account for their wonderful powers of\r\nscent.\r\n\r\n'Swine', also, have these nerves largely developed; and necessarily so,\r\nas both in a state of nature or half-civilization, the greater portion\r\nof their food is buried under the earth or mingled with the filth and\r\nmire of their sties, and would pass unheeded, if not for the acuteness\r\nof their nasal organs.\r\n\r\nIn Daniels' \"Rural Sports,\" will be found an interesting account of a\r\nsow having been taught to find and point game of various kinds, and\r\noften having been known to stand on partridges at a distance of forty\r\nyards, which is more than can reasonably be expected of every first-rate\r\ndog. She was not only broke to find and stand game, but hunted with the\r\ndogs, and backed successfully when on a point. This extraordinary animal\r\nevinced great aptness for learning, and afterwards great enthusiasm in\r\nthe sport; showing symptoms of pleasure at the sight of a gun, or when\r\ncalled upon to accompany a party to the field. Her hunting was not\r\nconfined to any particular game, but stood equally well on partridges,\r\npheasants, snipes, rabbits, &c. (See Blaine, part vii, chap, iii, page\r\n792.)\r\n\r\nMost of animals instinctively employ the organ of scent to seek out\r\nfood, or avert personal danger, in preference to that of sight; but some\r\ndepend more upon the latter than the former, either from instinct or the\r\nforce of education.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the greyhound, though equally gifted with the sense of\r\nsmell, as that of sight, has been taught to depend upon the one organ to\r\nthe entire exclusion of the other, which is quite the reverse of the\r\nsetter and pointer; but the wonderful speed of these dogs renders it\r\nquite unnecessary that he should employ the olfactory nerves, as no\r\nanimal, however swift, can hope to escape from him in a fair race, when\r\nonce near enough to be seen; though there are some that may elude his\r\ngrasp by a \"'ruse de guerre'\" when too hardly pressed. ('Extracted from\r\nour essay in No. 1, vol. xvi, of the \"Spirit of the Times.'\")--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE\r\n\r\nWe find little mention of insanity in the domesticated animals in any of\r\nour modern authors, whether treating on agriculture, horsemanship, or\r\nveterinary medicine, and yet there are some singular and very\r\ninteresting cases of aberration of intellect. The inferior animals are,\r\nto a certain extent, endowed with the same faculties as ourselves. They\r\nare even susceptible of the same moral qualities. Hatred, love, fear,\r\nhope, joy, distress, courage, timidity, jealousy, and many varied\r\npassions influence and agitate them, as they do the human being. The dog\r\nis an illustration of this---the most susceptible to every\r\nimpression--approaching the nearest to man in his instincts, and in many\r\nactions that surprise the philosopher, who justly appreciates it.\r\n\r\nWhat eagerness to bite is often displayed by the dog when labouring\r\nunder enteritis, and especially by him who has imbibed the poison of\r\nrabies! How singular is the less dangerous malady which induces the\r\nhorse and the dog to press unconsciously forward under the influence of\r\nvertigo!--the eagerness with which, when labouring under phrenitis, he\r\nstrikes at everything with his foot, or rushes upon it to seize it with\r\nhis teeth! A kind of nostalgia is often recognised in that depression\r\nwhich nothing can dissipate, and the invincible aversion to food, by\r\nmeans of which many animals perish, who are prevented from returning to\r\nthe place where they once lived, and the localities to which they had\r\nbeen accustomed.\r\n\r\nThese are circumstances proving that the dog is endowed with\r\nintelligence and with affections like ours; and, if they do not equal\r\nours, they are of the same character.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the foundation of intellectual power, viz.: attention,\r\nmemory, association, and imagination, the difference between man and\r\nanimals is in degree, and not in kind. Thus stands the account,--with\r\nthe quadruped as well as the biped,--the impression is made on the mind;\r\nattention fixes it there; memory recurs to it; imagination combines it,\r\nrightly or erroneously, with many other impressions; judgment determines\r\nthe value of it, and the conclusions that are to be drawn from it, if\r\nnot with logical precision, yet with sufficient accuracy for every\r\npractical purpose.\r\n\r\nA bitch, naturally ill-tempered, and that would not suffer a stranger to\r\ntouch her, had scirrhous enlargement on one of her teats. As she lay in\r\nthe lap of her mistress, an attempt was repeatedly made to examine the\r\ntumour, in spite of many desperate attempts on her part to bite. All at\r\nonce, however, something seemed to strike her mind. She whined, wagged\r\nher tail, and sprung from the lap of her mistress to the ground. It was\r\nto crouch at the feet of the surgeon, and to lay herself down and expose\r\nthe tumour to his inspection. She submitted to a somewhat painful\r\nexamination of it, and to a far more serious operation afterwards. Some\r\nyears passed away, and whenever she saw the operator, she testified her\r\njoy and her gratitude in the most expressive and endearing manner.\r\n\r\nA short time since, the following scene took place in a street adjoining\r\nHanover-square. It was an exhibition of a highly interesting character,\r\nand worthy to be placed upon record. The editor of the Lancet having\r\nheard that a French gentleman (M. Léonard), who had for some time been\r\nengaged in instructing two dogs in various performances that required\r\nthe exercise, not merely of the natural instincts of the animal and the\r\npower of imitation, but of a higher intellect, and a degree of\r\nreflection and judgment far greater than is commonly developed in the\r\ndog; was residing in London, obtained an introduction, and was\r\nobligingly favoured by M. Leonard with permission to hold a\r\n'conversazione' with his extraordinary pupils. He thus describes the\r\ninterview:\r\n\r\nTwo fine dogs, of the Spanish breed, were introduced by M. Leonard, with\r\nthe customary French politesse, the largest by the name of M. Philax,\r\nthe other as M. Brac (or spot); the former had been in training three,\r\nthe latter two, years. They were in vigorous health, and, having bowed\r\nvery gracefully, seated themselves on the hearth-rug side by side. M.\r\nLéonard then gave a lively description of the means he had employed to\r\ndevelop the cerebral system in these animals--how, from having been fond\r\nof the chase, and ambitious of possessing the best-trained dogs, he had\r\nemployed the usual course of training--how the conviction had been\r\nimpressed on his mind, that by gentle usage, and steady perseverance in\r\ninducing the animal to repeat again and again what was required, not\r\nonly would the dog be capable of performing that specific act, but that\r\npart of the brain which was brought into activity by the mental effort\r\nwould become more largely developed, and hence a permanent increase of\r\nmental power be obtained.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning is in accordance with the known laws of the physiology of\r\nthe nervous system, and is fraught with the most important results. We\r\nmay refer the reader interested in the subject to the masterly little\r\nwork of Dr. Verity, \"Changes produced in the Nervous System by\r\nCivilization.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this introduction, M. Léonard spoke to his dogs in French, in his\r\nusual tone, and ordered one of them to walk, the other to lie down, to\r\nrun, to gallop, halt, crouch, &c., which they performed as promptly and\r\ncorrectly as the most docile children. Then he directed them to go\r\nthrough the usual exercises of the 'manége', which they performed as\r\nwell as the best-trained ponies at Astley's.\r\n\r\nHe next placed six cards of different colours on the floor, and, sitting\r\nwith his back to the dogs, directed one to pick up the blue card, and\r\nthe other the white, &c., varying his orders rapidly, and speaking in\r\nsuch a manner that it was impossible the dogs could have executed his\r\ncommands if they had not had a perfect knowledge of the words. For\r\ninstance, M. Léonard said, \"Philax, take the red card and give it to\r\nBrac; and, Brac, take the white card and give it to Philax;\" the dags\r\ninstantly did this, and exchanged cards with each other. He then said,\r\n\"Philax, put your card on the green, and Brac, put yours on the blue;\"\r\nand this was instantly performed. Pieces of bread and meat were placed\r\non the floor, with figured cards, and a variety of directions were given\r\nto the dogs, so as to put their intelligence and obedience to a severe\r\ntest. They brought the meat, bread, or cards, as commanded, but did not\r\nattempt to eat or to touch unless ordered. Philax was then ordered to\r\nbring a piece of meat and give it to Brac, and then Brac was told to\r\ngive it back to Philax, who was to return it to its place. Philax was\r\nnext told he might bring a piece of bread and eat it; but, before he had\r\ntime to swallow it, his master forbade him, and directed him to show\r\nthat he had not disobeyed, and the dog instantly protruded the crust\r\nbetween his lips.\r\n\r\nWhile many of these feats were being performed, M. Léonard snapped a\r\nwhip violently, to prove that the animals were so completely under\r\ndiscipline, that they would not heed any interruption.\r\n\r\nAfter many other performances, M. Léonard invited a gentleman to play a\r\ngame of dominos with one of them. The younger and slighter dog then\r\nseated himself on a chair at the table, and the writer and M. Léonard\r\nseated themselves opposite. Six dominos were placed on their edges in\r\nthe usual manner before the dog, and a like number before the writer.\r\nThe dog having a double number, took one up in his mouth, and put it in\r\nthe middle of the table; the writer placed a corresponding piece on one\r\nside; the dog immediately played another correctly, and so on until all\r\nthe pieces were engaged. Other six dominos were then given to each, and\r\nthe writer intentionally placed a wrong number. The dog looked\r\nsurprised, stared very earnestly at the writer, growled, and finally\r\nbarked angrily. Finding that no notice was taken of his remonstrances,\r\nhe pushed away the wrong domino with his nose, and took up a suitable\r\none from his own pieces, and placed it in its stead. The writer then\r\nplayed correctly; the dog followed, and won the game. Not the slightest\r\nintimation could have been given by M. Léonard to the dog. This mode of\r\nplay must have been entirely the result of his own observation and\r\njudgment. It should be added that the performances were strictly\r\nprivate. The owner of the dogs was a gentleman of independent fortune,\r\nand the instruction of his dogs had been taken up merely as a curious\r\nand amusing investigation. [1]\r\n\r\nAnother strange attainment of the dog is the learning to speak. The\r\nFrench Academicians mention one of these animals that could call in an\r\nintelligible manner for tea, coffee, chocolate, &c. The account is given\r\nby the celebrated Leibnitz, who communicated it to the Royal Academy of\r\nFrance. This dog was of a middling size, and was the property of a\r\npeasant in Saxony.\r\n\r\nA little boy, a peasant's son, imagined that he perceived in the dog's\r\nvoice an indistinct resemblance to certain words, and therefore took it\r\ninto his head to teach him to speak. For this purpose he spared neither\r\ntime nor pains with his pupil, who was about three years old when his\r\nlearned education commenced, and in process of time he was able to\r\narticulate no fewer than thirty distinct words. He was, however,\r\nsomewhat of a truant, and did not very willingly exert his talent, and\r\nwas rather pressed than otherwise into the service of literature. It was\r\nnecessary that the words should be pronounced to him each time, and then\r\nhe repeated them after his preceptor. Leibnitz attests that he heard the\r\nanimal talk in this way, and the French Academicians add, that unless\r\nthey had received the testimony of so celebrated a person they would\r\nscarcely have dared to report the circumstance. It took place in Misnia,\r\nin Saxony.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORAL QUALITIES OF THE DOG.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to another division of our subject, 'the moral qualities of\r\nthe dog', strongly developed and beautifully displayed, and often\r\nputting the biped to shame.\r\n\r\nIt is truly said of the dog that he possesses\r\n\r\n                        \"Many a good\r\n  And useful quality, and virtue too,\r\n  Attachment never to be weaned or changed\r\n  By any change of fortune; proof alike\r\n  Against unkindness, absence, and neglect;\r\n  Fidelity, that neither bribe nor threat\r\n  Can move or warp; and gratitude, for small\r\n  And trivial favours, lasting as the life,\r\n  And glistening even in the dying eye.\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be noticed that, among the inferior animals with large\r\nnerves and more medullary substance, there are acuter senses; but man,\r\nexcelling them in the general bulk of his brain, and more particularly\r\nin the cortical portion of it, has far superior powers of mind. These\r\nare circumstances that deserve the deepest consideration. In their wild\r\nstate the brutes have no concern--no idea beyond their food and their\r\nreproduction. In their domesticated state, they are doomed to be the\r\nservants of man. Their power of mind is sufficient to qualify them for\r\nthis service: but were proportionate intellectual capacity added to\r\nthis--were they made conscious of their strength, and of the objects\r\nthat could be effected by it--they would burst their bonds, and man\r\nwould in his turn be the victim and the slave.\r\n\r\nThere is an important faculty, termed 'attention'. It is that which\r\ndistinguishes the promising pupil from him of whom no good hope could be\r\nformed, and the scientific man from the superficial and ignorant one.\r\nThe power of keeping the mind steadily bent upon one purpose, is the\r\ngreat secret of individual and moral improvement. We see the habit of\r\nattention carried in the dog to a very considerable extent. The terrier\r\neagerly watching for vermin--the sporting dog standing staunch to his\r\npoint, however he may be annoyed by the blunders of his companion or the\r\nunskilfulness of his master--the foxhound, insensible to a thousand\r\nscents, and deaf to every other sound, while he anxiously and\r\nperseveringly searches out the track of his prey--these are striking\r\nillustrations of the power of attention.\r\n\r\nThen, the impression having been received, and the mind having been\r\nemployed in its examination, it is treasured up in the storehouse of the\r\nmind for future use.\r\n\r\nThis is the faculty of memory; and a most important one it is. Of the\r\n'memory' of the 'dog', and the recollection of kindness received, there\r\nare a thousand stories, from the return of Ulysses to the present day,\r\nand we have seen enough of that faithful animal to believe most of them.\r\nAn officer was abroad with his regiment, during the American war. He had\r\na fine Newfoundland dog, his constant companion, whom he left with his\r\nfamily. After the lapse of several years he returned. His dog met him at\r\nthe door, leaped upon his neck, licked his face, and died.\r\n\r\nOf the accuracy and retentiveness of memory in the dog, as respects the\r\ninstruction he has received from his master, we have abundant proof in\r\nthe pointer and the hound, and it may perhaps be with some of them, as\r\nwith men, that the lesson must sometimes be repeated, and even impressed\r\non the memory in a way not altogether pleasant.\r\n\r\n[We know an imported Irish setter, formerly in possession of a gentleman\r\nof this city, who on many occasions, while hunting, displayed an\r\nextraordinary instinct, even sufficiently remarkable to make us believe\r\nthat he possessed not only the most acute powers of observation, but\r\nthat he also enjoyed the faculty of \"inductive reasoning,\" independent\r\nof any mechanical training, many of his performances being entirely\r\nvoluntary, and the result of causes dependent upon accidental\r\ncircumstances alone: for instance, when lost from observation, he would\r\nnoiselessly withdraw from his point, hunt up his master, and induce him,\r\nby peculiar signs, to follow him to the spot where he had previously\r\nobserved the birds.\r\n\r\nIn his old days, \"Smoke\" was much opposed to hunting with an indifferent\r\nshot, and would leave the field perfectly disgusted, after a succession\r\nof bad shooting; seeming to argue that he no longer sought after game\r\nfor amusement, but that he expected his efforts to be repaid by the\r\ndeath of the birds.\r\n\r\nThis dog was of a morose and dignified disposition, surly with\r\nstrangers, and inclined to quarrel with any one who carried a stick or\r\nwhip in their hands; never forgetting an injury, and growling whenever\r\nany person who had offended him made their appearance. He was also\r\nparticularly irritable and tenacious of his rights when hunting,\r\nshunning all puppies or heedless dogs, and exhibiting a very irascible\r\ndisposition if superseded in a point by another dog; and on one occasion\r\nattacked a young pointer in the field, who, in opposition to all his\r\ngrowling and show of irony, would persist in crawling before him, when\r\non a point.--L]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG-CARTS.\r\n\r\nThese were, and still are, in the country, connected with many an act of\r\natrocious cruelty. We do not object to the dog as a beast of draught. He\r\nis so in the northern regions, and he is as happy as any other animal in\r\nthose cold and inhospitable countries. He is so in Holland, and he is as\r\ncomfortable there as any other beast that wears the collar. He is not so\r\nin Newfoundland: there he is shamefully treated. It is to the abuse of\r\nthe thing, the poor and half-starved condition of the animal, the\r\nscandalous weight that he is made to draw, and the infamous usage to\r\nwhich he is exposed, that we object. We would put him precisely on the\r\nsame footing with the horse, and then we should be able, perhaps, to\r\nafford him, not all the protection we could wish, but nearly as much as\r\nwe have obtained for the horse. We would have every cart licensed, not\r\nfor the sake of adding to the revenue, but of getting at the owner; and\r\ntherefore the taxing need not be any great sum. We would have the cart\r\nlicensed for the carrying of goods only; or a separate license taken out\r\nif it carried or drew a human being.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the cruelty principally exists. Before the dog-carts\r\nwere put down in the metropolis, we then saw a man and a woman in one of\r\nthese carts, drawn by a single dog, and going at full trot. Every\r\npassenger execrated them, and the trot was increased to a gallop, in\r\norder more speedily to escape the just reproaches that proceeded from\r\nevery mouth. We would have the name and address of the owner, and the\r\nnumber of the cart, painted on some conspicuous part of the vehicle, and\r\nin letters and figures as large as on the common carts. Every passenger\r\nwho witnessed any flagrant act of cruelty would then be enabled to take\r\nthe number of the cart, and summon the owner; and the police should have\r\nthe same power of interference which they have with regard to other\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\nAfter a plan like this had been working a little while, the nuisance\r\nwould be materially abated; and, indeed, the consciousness of the ease\r\nwith which the offender might be summoned, would go far to get rid of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROPPING.\r\n\r\nThis is an infliction of too much torture for the gratification of a\r\nnonsensical fancy; and, after all, in the opinion of many, and of those,\r\ntoo, who are fondest of dogs, the animal looks far better in his natural\r\nstate than when we have exercised all our cruel art upon him. Besides,\r\nthe effects of this absurd amputation do not cease with the healing of\r\nthe ear. The intense inflammation that we have set up, materially\r\ninjures the internal structure of this organ. Deafness is occasionally\r\nproduced by it in some dogs, and constantly in others. The frequent\r\ndeafness of the pug is solely attributable to the outrageous as well as\r\nabsurd rounding of his ears. The almost invariable deafness of the white\r\nwire-haired terrier is to be traced to this cause.\r\n\r\n[Among the many tastes and fancies that the Americans have inherited\r\nfrom their ancestors, the English, may be enumerated the absurd practice\r\nof fashioning the ears of different breeds of dogs to a certain standard\r\nof beauty. Mr. Blain very justly remarks that it must be a false taste\r\nwhich has taught us to prefer a curtailed organ to a perfect one,\r\nwithout gaining any convenience by the operation. The dogs upon which\r\nthis species of barbecuing are more particularly practised in this\r\ncountry, are the bull-dogs and terriers.\r\n\r\nWe imagine that many of our readers will be surprised when they learn\r\nthat this operation, although so simple in itself, and performed by\r\nevery reckless stable-boy, is attended with great suffering to the\r\npuppy, and not unfrequently with total deafness. Severe inflammation,\r\nextending to the interior of the ear, often follows this operation, more\r\nespecially when awkwardly performed, as is frequently the case, by the\r\naid of the miserable instruments within the reach of our hostlers; to\r\nsay nothing of the savage fashion of using the teeth for this purpose,\r\nas is often done by ignorant fellows, who even take credit to themselves\r\nfor the clever style in which they perform this outlandish operation.\r\nMr. Blain states, that it is a barbarous custom to twist the ears off,\r\nby swinging the dog around; and we are satisfied that every sensible\r\nperson will respond to this humane sentiment. We have never had the\r\nmisfortune to see this latter method put into practice, and trust that\r\nsuch an operation is unknown among us, although, from the manner in\r\nwhich this gentleman condemns it, we are led to suppose that this mode\r\nis not uncommon in the old country.\r\n\r\nAs custom has sanctioned the cropping of dogs, in spite of all that can\r\nbe said upon the subject, it should be done in such a manner as to cause\r\nthe least possible pain to the animal. The fourth or fifth week is the\r\nproper age for this operation; if done sooner, the flap is apt to sprout\r\nand become deformed: if later, the cartilage has grown more thick and\r\nsensitive. The imaginary beauty of a terrier crop consists in the foxy\r\nappearance of the ears, which is easily produced by the clean cut of a\r\nsharp, strong pair of scissors. The first cut should commence at the\r\nposterior base of the ear, near to the head, and be carried to the\r\nextremity of the flap, taking off about the eighth of an inch or more in\r\nwidth. The second cut should extend from the base of the ear in front,\r\nsomewhat obliquely, to intersect the other cut within a few lines of the\r\npoint of the flap. These two cuts will shape the ear in such a style as\r\nto please the most fastidious eye, and will require no further trimming.\r\nThe pieces taken from the first ear will answer as guides in cutting the\r\nother. The mother should not be allowed to lick the ears of the puppies,\r\nas is generally done, under the supposition that she assists in the\r\nhealing process, when, in fact, she irritates them, and occasions\r\nincreased inflammation. If the wounds are tardy at healing, or become\r\nmangy, they may be bathed gently with a weak solution of alum.\r\n\r\nWe regret to find that Mr. Skinner, so well known to the sporting world\r\nas the able extoller and defender of the rights of our canine friends,\r\nshould recommend the cropping of terriers. We are convinced that he\r\nwould change his feelings upon this subject, if he placed any confidence\r\nin the opinions of Blain, Youatt, Scott, or Daniel, all of whom condemn\r\nthe practice as barbarous, and as often occasioning great suffering, and\r\neven total deafness, throughout the progeny of successive generations,\r\nas witnessed in the white wire-haired terrier and pug above mentioned.\r\n\r\nWo have had the good fortune to persuade some of our friends to desist\r\nfrom thus mutilating their terrier pups, all of whom, consequently, grew\r\nup with beautiful full ears and long tails, which were much admired; and\r\nto the eyes of many, the dogs seemed more sprightly and knowing with\r\ntheir long flaps, than when deprived of those natural appendages.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTAILING.\r\n\r\nThen 'the tail' of the dog does not suit the fancy of the owner. It must\r\nbe shortened in some of these animals, and taken off altogether in\r\nothers. If the sharp, strong scissors, with a ligature, were used, the\r\noperation, although still indefensible, would not be a very cruel one,\r\nfor the tail may be removed almost in a moment, and the wound soon\r\nheals; but for the beastly gnawing off of the part, and the drawing out\r\nof the tendons and nerves--these are the acts of a cannibal; and he who\r\norders or perpetrates a barbarity so nearly approaching to cannibalism,\r\ndeserves to be scouted from all society.\r\n\r\n[As a matter of necessity, we cannot sanction the too frequent and cruel\r\npractice of cutting or otherwise barbecuing different portions of the\r\nbodies of our domestic animals, and more particularly the often absurd\r\nfancy or cropping and sterning dogs. Nevertheless, we must admit the\r\npropriety of, and, in fact, recommend, the taking off a small portion of\r\nthe pointer's tail, not to increase his beauty, but to save him some\r\nafter suffering. A long tail is frequently lacerated in close thickets,\r\nand thus rendered sore and mangy: this is prevented by the operation, as\r\nit becomes better protected by the body, as also more thickly covered by\r\nthe feather which generally forms over it.\r\n\r\nWhen the pups are a month or six weeks old, this operation can be\r\nperformed with little pain to the animal, by means of sharp scissors or\r\na knife; but never allow any one to bite the tail off, as is often done\r\nby some dirty and unfeeling stable-men. Although a long tail is\r\ninconvenient, a too short one is more unsightly; care should therefore\r\nbe taken not to remove too much. The quantity should be regulated by the\r\nsize of the breed: for a medium breed, an inch is sufficient to be cut\r\noff at this age. Some sportsmen in England, Mr. Blain also informs us,\r\ndraw out the lower tendons of the tail, which present themselves after\r\namputation, with a pair of forceps, with a view of causing the tail to\r\nbe carried higher, which adds to the style and appearance of the dog,\r\nwhen in the field. This practice, we agree with Mr. Youatt, is\r\ncannibal-like, and very painful; and, to say the least of it, of very\r\ndoubtful propriety, as it is but seldom we find a good breed of dog\r\ncarrying, while hunting, a slovenly tail.\r\n\r\nIf there should be any appearance of hemorrhage after this operation, a\r\nsmall piece of tape or twine may be tied around the tail, which will\r\nimmediately arrest the bleeding. This ligature should not remain on\r\nlonger than a few hours, as the parts included in it will be apt to\r\nslough and make a mangy ulcer, difficult to heal.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEW-CLAWS\r\n\r\nNext comes the depriving the dog of his 'dew-claws'--the supplementary\r\ntoes a little above the foot. They are supposed to interfere with\r\nhunting by becoming entangled with the grass or underwood. This rarely\r\nhappens. The truth of the matter is, they are simply illustrations of\r\nthe uniformity of structure which prevails in all animals, so far as is\r\nconsistent with their destiny. The 'dew-claws' only make up the number\r\nof toes in other animals. If they are attached, as they are in some\r\ndogs, simply by a portion of skin, they may be removed without any very\r\ngreat pain, yet the man of good feeling would not meddle with them. He\r\nwould not unnecessarily inflict any pain that he can avoid; and here, in\r\nseveral of the breeds, the toe is united by an actual joint; and if they\r\nare dissected because they are a little in the way, it is a barbarous\r\noperation, and nothing can justify it.\r\n\r\n[Notwithstanding our author's condemnation of this practice, there are\r\nmany sportsmen who think it very necessary to remove this supernumerary\r\ntoe, fearing that it may interfere with the dog while hunting, as above\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nMr. Blain, both a practical sportsman and scientific gentleman, to whose\r\nopinions we must at all times show a due regard, considers the removal\r\nof these false appendages very necessary, stating that they often become\r\ntroublesome, not only in the field, but that they frequently turn in and\r\nwound the flesh with their nails.\r\n\r\nWe have never seen any particular inconvenience arising from the\r\npresence of these dew-claws, and are not in the habit of taking them\r\noff; but, as the operation is a trifling one, and attended with little\r\nor no pain, we are disposed to recommend its general adoption, as it\r\nimproves the appearance of the legs; and their presence may sometimes\r\nprove inconvenient to the animal, as stated by Mr. Blain. These claws\r\nmost commonly have a ligamentous attachment only to the leg, which may\r\nbe divided, a few days after birth, by a pair of sharp scissors or a\r\nknife; and if a bony union exists, it is generally of such a trifling\r\nnature that it can be severed in the same way.--L.]\r\n\r\nThe cruelties that are perpetrated on puppies during the course of their\r\neducation or 'breaking-in', are sometimes infamous. Young dogs, like\r\nyoung people, must be to a certain degree coerced; but these animals\r\nreceive from nature so great an aptitude for learning, and practising\r\nthat which we require of them, and their own pleasure is so much\r\nconnected with what they learn, that there is no occasion for one-tenth\r\npart of the correction that is occasionally inflicted; and the frequent\r\nconsequence of the cruelty to which they are subjected, is cowardice or\r\nferocity during life.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, as the author was going over one of the commons in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the metropolis, now enclosed, he heard the loud\r\nsounds of the lash and the screams of a dog. He hurried on, and found\r\ntwo men, one holding a greyhound while another was unmercifully flogging\r\nhim. He had inflicted many lashes, and was continuing the correction.\r\nThe author indignantly interfered, and the dog was liberated, but with a\r\ngreat deal of abuse from the men; and a gentleman galloping up, and who\r\nwas the owner of the dog, and a Middlesex magistrate to boot, seemed\r\ndisposed to support his people in no very measured terms On being\r\naddressed, however, by name, and recognising the speaker, and his\r\nattention being directed to the 'whaled' and even bloody state of\r\nthe dog, he offered the best excuse that he could.\r\n\r\nWe met again some months afterwards. \"That hiding,\" said he, \"that\r\noffended you so much did Carlo good, for he has not been touched since.\"\r\n\"No,\" was the reply; \"you were a little ashamed of your fellows, and\r\nhave altered your system, and find that your dogs do not want this\r\nunmerciful negro-whipping.\"\r\n\r\nStories are told of the 'kennel-hare'--a hare kept on purpose, and which\r\nis sometimes shown to the fox or stag-hounds. The moment that any of\r\nthem open, they are tied up to the whipping-post, and flogged, while the\r\nkeepers at every stroke call out \"Ware hare!\" A sheep has also been\r\nshown to them, or still is, after which another unmerciful flogging is\r\nadministered, amidst cries of \"Ware sheep!\" If this is not sufficient,\r\nsome of the wool is dipped in train oil, and put into the dog's mouth,\r\nwhich is sewed up for many hours in order to cure him of sheep-biting.\r\nThere was an almost similar punishment for killing poultry; and there\r\nwas the 'puzzle' and the 'check-collar', cruelly employed, for killing\r\nother dogs.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of truth, and there may occasionally be some\r\nexaggeration, in these accounts; but the sportsman who is indebted for\r\nthe pleasures of the field to the intelligence and exertions of his\r\nhorses and his dogs, is bound, by every principle that can influence an\r\nhonourable mind, to defend them from all wanton and useless cruelty.\r\nThere is a dog, and a faithful and valuable one, that powerfully demands\r\nthe assistance of the humane--the yard or watch-dog. He is not only for\r\nthe most part deprived of his liberty, but too often neglected and made\r\nunnecessarily to suffer. How seldom do we see him in the enjoyment of a\r\ngood bed of straw, or, rather, how frequently is everything about his\r\nkennel in a most filthy and disgusting state! The following hint not\r\nonly relates to him, but to every dog that is tied up out of doors.\r\n\"Their cribs or their kennels, as they are called, should be constructed\r\nso as to turn, in order to prevent their inmates from being exposed to\r\nthe cutting blasts of winter. Where they have no other refuge, all\r\nanimals seek shelter from the weather by turning their backs to the\r\nwind; but, as the dog thus confined cannot do so, his kennel should be\r\ncapable of turning, or at least should be placed so as not to face the\r\nweather more than is necessary. The premises would be in quite as great\r\nsecurity, for the dog depends as much upon his ear and sense of smell as\r\nupon his eye, and would equally detect a stranger's presence if he were\r\ndeprived of sight.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Zoological Gardens, an old blind dog used to be placed at the\r\ndoor of the dissecting-house. Few had any business there, and every one\r\nof them he, after a while, used to recognise and welcome full ton yards\r\noff, by wagging his tail; at the same distance, he would begin to growl\r\nat a stranger unless accompanied by a friend. From the author's long\r\nhabit of noticing him, he used to recognise his step before it would\r\nseem possible for its sound to be heard. He followed him with his\r\nsightless eyes in whatever direction he moved, and was not satisfied\r\nuntil he had patted and fondled him.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG-PITS.\r\n\r\nOf the demoniacal use of the dog in the 'fighting-pits', and the\r\natrocities that were committed there, I will not now speak. These places\r\nwere frequented by few others than the lowest of the low. Cruelties were\r\nthere inflicted that seemed to be a libel on human nature; and such was\r\nthe baneful influence of the scene, that it appeared to be scarcely\r\npossible for any one to enter these pits without experiencing a greater\r\nor less degree of moral degradation.\r\n\r\nThe public dog-pits have now been put down; but the system of\r\ndog-fighting, with most of its attendant atrocities, still continues.\r\nThere are many more low public-houses than there used to be pits, that\r\nhave roomy places behind, and out of sight, where there are regular\r\nmeetings for this purpose. Those among the neighbours who cannot fail of\r\nbeing annoyed and disgusted by the frequent uproar, might give a clue to\r\nthese dens of infamy; and the depriving of a few of the landlords of\r\ntheir license would go a great way towards the effectual suppression of\r\nthe practice.\r\n\r\nWould it be thought possible that certain of our young aristocracy keep\r\nfighting-dogs at the repositories of various dealers in the outskirts of\r\nthe metropolis; and that these animals remain there, as it were, at\r\nlivery, the owners coming at their pleasure, and making and devising\r\nwhat matches they think proper?\r\n\r\nHowever disgraceful it may be, it is actually the fact. Here is a field\r\nfor \"the suppression of cruelty!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG-STEALING.\r\n\r\nThe practice of stealing dogs is both directly and indirectly connected\r\nwith a great deal of cruelty. There are more than twenty miscreants who\r\nare well known to subsist by picking up dogs in the street. There are\r\ngenerally two of them together with aprons rolled round their waists.\r\nThe dog is caught up at the corner of one of the streets, concealed in a\r\nmoment in the apron, and the thieves are far away before the owner\r\nsuspects the loss. These dogs, that have been used to every kind of\r\nluxury, are crowded into dark and filthy cellars, where they become\r\ninfected by various diseases. The young ones have distemper, and the old\r\nones mange, and all become filled with vermin. There they remain until a\r\nsufficient reward is offered for their recovery, or they are sent far\r\ninto the country, or shipped for France or some other foreign market.\r\nLittle or nothing is done by punishing the inferior rogues in this\r\ntraffic. The blow must be struck at those of a superior class. I will\r\nnot assert that every dog-dealer is in league with, and profits by, the\r\nlower thieves; but it is true of a great many of them, and it is the\r\nprincipal and most lucrative part of their trade. They are likewise\r\nintimately connected with the dog-fights, and encourage them, for the\r\nsake of their trade as dealers. An attempt should be made to bring the\r\nmatter home to these scoundrels. [2]\r\n\r\n[Dog-stealing, we are more particularly informed by Col. Hawker, is\r\nreduced to a perfect system in London, and carried on by a set of\r\nfellows who, by their cunning and peculiar knack, are enabled to avoid\r\nall detection in their nefarious traffic, and thus, by extortion of\r\nrewards or sales of stolen dogs, reap a rich harvest for the whole\r\nfraternity from the well-stored pockets of the numerous dog-fanciers of\r\nthe English capital.\r\n\r\nThe villains engaged in this business are known among themselves under\r\nthe too often abused sobriquet of \"the Fancy,\" and assuming the garb of\r\ndifferent mechanics, prowl about the streets, oftentimes with the proper\r\ntools in their hands, carelessly watching the movements of every dog\r\nthat passes by, ready to grab him up the first fitting opportunity. The\r\ndog is then concealed till a suitable reward is offered for him, when,\r\nthrough the intervention of a third person, a trusty agent of the\r\nsociety, he is delivered over to his rightful owner, the actual rogue\r\nnever appearing in the whole transaction.\r\n\r\nIf no reward, or an insufficient one, is offered for the recovery of the\r\ndog, he is either sent off to the country, or, perhaps, cautiously\r\nexposed for sale in some distant quarter of the city, or perhaps killed\r\nfor his skin alone.\r\n\r\nThese gentry, however, prefer returning dogs to their owners for a\r\nmoderate compensation, as they thus know at what rate the animal is\r\nvalued, and cherish the hope of soon being able to steal him again, and\r\nthus obtaining another reward.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances of a lady paying, in successive rewards, a sum\r\nnot less than fifteen guineas for a miserable little lap-dog not worth\r\nas many shillings.\r\n\r\nIf anything is said about the law, or threats of prosecution held out in\r\nthe notice offering a reward for a \"lost or stolen dog,\" the death of\r\nthe kidnapped animal is inevitable, as the \"Fancy\" prefer sacrificing an\r\noccasional prize rather than run the risk of detection by some\r\nenthusiastic or stubborn dog owner. These fellows, as well as thieves\r\ngenerally, are said to have a method of quieting the fiercest watch-dogs\r\nby throwing them a narcotic ball, which they call \"puddening the\r\nanimal.\"\r\n\r\nThe following account, extracted from Hawker's work, will give the\r\nAmerican reader a 'perfect' insight into the maneuvering of these\r\nsharpers.\r\n\r\n  \"In the month of May, 1830, Mr. Lang lost a favourite setter. He\r\n  posted handbills offering two guineas reward; on hearing of which a\r\n  man came and told him the reward was not enough, but that if he would\r\n  make it four guineas he could find his dog, and the amount must be\r\n  deposited in the hands of a landlord who would procure him a\r\n  ticket-card. He should then be met to his appointment in some private\r\n  field, where he would receive his dog on condition that no questions\r\n  should be asked. Mr. Lang sent his shopman, about half-past ten at\r\n  night, to White Conduit Fields to meet the parties, who, on receiving\r\n  the ticket, delivered up the dog. But there was great hesitation in\r\n  transacting this affair, in consequence of the dog having on a lock to\r\n  a steel chain collar with Mr. Lang's name, and which, therefore,\r\n  induced them to proceed with extreme caution, through fear, as they\r\n  supposed, of detection for felony. The whole amount paid for\r\n  recovering this setter was £4 17s., £2 10s. of which went to the men\r\n  who had him. The rest was divided among others of the \"Fancy\". The\r\n  same person who gave Mr. Lang the information, said that if ever he\r\n  lost a dog, and applied to him, he could undertake to get him back\r\n  again within thirty-six hours, provided he would make it worth his\r\n  while to do so; because all dogs taken by the \"Fancy\" are brought to\r\n  their office and regularly booked by the secretary.\"\r\n  ('Hawker on Shooting', p. 592.)--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Plutarch relates that, at the theatre of Marcellus, a dog\r\nwas exhibited before the emperor Vespasian, so well instructed as to\r\nexercise in every kind of dance. He afterwards feigned illness in a most\r\nsingular manner, so as to strike the spectators with astonishment. He\r\nfirst exhibited various symptoms of pain; he then fell down as if dead,\r\nand, afterwards seeming to revive, as if waking from a profound sleep,\r\nand then sported about and showed various demonstrations of joy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Bishop, of Bond-street, has assured the public, that he\r\nis able to prove that money has recently been extorted from the owners\r\nof dogs by dog-stealers and their confederates, to the amount of more\r\nthan a thousand pounds. Surely this calls for the decided interposition\r\nof the legislature. A strange case of atrocity and cruelty was related\r\nby a gentleman to Mr. Bishop.\r\n\r\n  \"A young dog of mine,\" says he, \"was lost in London, and, being aware\r\n  that if a noise was made about it, a great price would be asked for\r\n  it, I gave out that I wanted to purchase one: I was shown my own dog.\r\n  I seized it; but there were several scoundrels present who professed\r\n  to belong to it, and threatened to kill the dog if I did not pay for\r\n  it. I proceeded to describe it as my own, stating that it had 'bad\r\n  back or double teeth'. Judge of my surprise when, after great\r\n  difficulty, and the dog crying greatly, its mouth was opened, and all\r\n  the back teeth had been taken out! I paid two pounds for it before\r\n  they would let me take it away; but, in consequence of the injuries it\r\n  had received, it died a few days afterward.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO CANINE PATHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nBY THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREDISPOSITION TO, AND CAUSES OF, DISEASES IN DOGS.--THE\r\nCLAIMS OF DOGS UPON US.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Unnumbered accidents and various ills\r\n  Attend thy pack, hang hovering o'er their heads,\r\n  And point the way that leads to death's dark cave.\r\n  Short is their span, few at the date arrive\r\n  Of ancient Argus, in old Homer's song\r\n  So highly honour'd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dog from early youth, in fact oftentimes at the very period of\r\nbirth, is exposed to many dangerous and troublesome affections, the\r\nresult of causes not less complex and multifarious than those that exert\r\nan influence over the human organization. Many diseases are the\r\nconsequence of their domesticity and the hereditary defects of their\r\nprogenitors, others are dependent upon accidental circumstances, bad\r\ntreatment, and improper nourishment. Not a few, however, of their most\r\nmortal maladies are the production of contagion, infection, and other\r\nlike causes, all exercising a general tendency to disease difficult to\r\ndefine and impossible to avoid.\r\n\r\nAlthough every species of dog is more or less subject to certain\r\ndiseases peculiar to their race, those breeds of most value and more\r\nparticularly subservient to the will of man are liable to a greater\r\nnumber of ills and casualties than other dogs, for the reason that they\r\nare more frequently exposed to unnatural fatigue, extremes of heat and\r\ncold, as also to the various dangers dependent upon the chase of wild\r\nanimals. Those diseases resulting from specific causes, either natural\r\nto the race or artificially produced by the animal itself in a state of\r\nmorbid derangement, are most frequent and fatal, as witnessed in\r\ndistemper, rabies, mange, &c. The intimate connexion existing between\r\nthe diseases of our canine friends and those of the human race, as also\r\nthe strong similarity in the action of many drugs over the two systems,\r\nrender the study of one branch almost synonymous with that of the other.\r\n\r\nA little attention, therefore, on the part of the physician will render\r\nhim quite familiar with and competent to relieve the many sufferings of\r\nthese our most faithful and grateful of companions, and at the same time\r\ncreate an interest in a study that cannot fail to be productive of\r\npleasure as well as information.\r\n\r\nThis subject, though claiming the attention of many skilful and\r\nintelligent persons in England and other countries, has scarce been\r\nthought of among us, and the mere mention of an infirmary or hospital\r\nfor the accommodation of invalid dogs, would involuntarily create a\r\nsmile of incredulity or contempt upon the face of most of our\r\ncountrymen. Notwithstanding this display of ignorance and positive want\r\nof humane feeling for animal suffering, or a just appreciation of canine\r\nworth, we must beg leave to inform these unbelievers that such\r\ninstitutions are quite numerous in many large cities of the old world;\r\nand they must also learn that these institutions are conducted by\r\ngentlemen of science upon a system not less regular and useful in this\r\nparticular branch, than similar establishments appropriated for the\r\nrelief of suffering humanity.\r\n\r\nTo these hospitals hundreds of valuable sick dogs are annually sent,\r\nwhere they receive every attention, and are often snatched from the very\r\njaws of death, or prevented, when attacked by rabies or other frightful\r\naffections, from doing mischief or propagating infection. Medicines the\r\nmost potent are administered to these interesting patients with the\r\nutmost care, either as assuagers of temporary pain, or as remedial\r\nagents in the cure of disease. Operations the most complex are performed\r\nwith the greatest skill, and every attention is bestowed upon these\r\ninvalids in their different wards, and no trouble is considered too\r\ngreat to save the life and secure the services of a valuable and\r\nfaithful dog.\r\n\r\nAs we have no such establishments in this country, and but a few persons\r\nupon whom we can rely for assistance in case of need, it behooves every\r\nlover of the dog to make himself familiar with, and the mode of treating\r\nthe most prominent affections of these companions of our sports, and at\r\nthe same time acquire a knowledge of the operations of certain medicines\r\nupon the system in a state of health or disease, so that our trusty\r\nfollowers may not be left to the tender mercies and physicking\r\npropensities of ignorant stablemen, or the officious intermeddling of\r\nthe \"pill-directing horse doctor.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessity of resorting to the assistance of either one or the other\r\nof these worthies is equally unfortunate, as the former will most\r\ngenerally kill the patient by slow degrees in forcibly and largely\r\nadministering the two modern specifics for all canine affections, viz.:\r\n\"soap pills and flowers of sulphur.\" While the latter, more bold but not\r\nless ignorant than the former, and his practice is perhaps the\r\npreferable of the two evils, will murder the dog out-right by the free\r\nexhibition of calomel, nux vomica and other deleterious substances, of\r\nthe operation of which he has but little knowledge or conception. This\r\nlatter system, as before said, is the most preferable, as its adoption\r\nsecures for our favourite a speedy termination of his sufferings, and\r\nalso relieves our own minds from a state of suspense that illustrates\r\ntoo forcibly the remark, \"Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIAL MEANS FOR THE CURE OF DISEASES.\r\n\r\nThere are but few remedies useful for the cure of diseases in the human\r\nrace that might not he employed by a skilful practitioner in overcoming\r\nthe same or different ailments in the dog. There are, however, several\r\ndrugs that cannot be used in the same proportions for the one as for the\r\nother, without danger of producing fatal consequences, as instanced in\r\ncalomel, a medicine so often abused by those who pretend to a knowledge\r\nof its administration in the maladies of dogs.\r\n\r\nThis article, though given with impunity to mankind in doses varying\r\nfrom five grains to twenty grains, as also oftentimes administered to\r\nhorses in quantities three or four times as great, without any\r\nappreciable effect, will not unfrequently, in minute doses of three\r\ngrains to four grains, produce the most violent symptoms in the\r\nstrongest dogs. We have seen severe vomiting and purging occasioned by\r\nthese small doses, and we once salivated a large mastiff by the\r\nadministration of two blue pills. It is thus that both the regular\r\nphysician, and even the veterinary surgeon, unacquainted with this\r\nremarkable peculiarity, will make fatal mistakes; and how much oftener\r\nmust such blunders take place when we intrust our canine friends to the\r\ncare of stable-boys, or a \"routine horse-doctor!\"\r\n\r\nNux vomica, another medicine much used, and most important in the\r\ntreatment of all nervous affections, is particularly noxious to dogs\r\neven in small quantities; a dose sufficient for a human subject under\r\nsome circumstances, would almost inevitably destroy the animal under the\r\nsame or analogous conditions.\r\n\r\nA drachm of the powdered nux vomica is sufficient to destroy the largest\r\nand most powerful dog, while a few grains will sometimes produce death\r\nin a few minutes if administered to smaller animals.\r\n\r\nWe prescribed forty grains in a roll of butter for a worthless cur a\r\nshort time since, which, as expected, produced great anxiety, difficulty\r\nof respiration, severe vomiting, tremors, spasmodic twitchings of the\r\nmuscles, convulsions, and ultimate death in the course of half an hour.\r\nThis powerful drug acts by causing a spasmodic stricture of the muscles\r\nengaged in respiration, as no signs of inflammation are observable in\r\nthe stomach and other organs after death.\r\n\r\nSpirits of turpentine, another remedy both simple and innocent in its\r\noperations upon the human economy, and so frequently prescribed for the\r\nexpulsion of worms from the bowels, is a dangerous medicine for a dog,\r\nand will often in very small quantities prove fatal.\r\n\r\nAloes, a medicine more extensively used in canine pathology than any\r\nother in the materia medica, is also very peculiar in its operations\r\nupon these animals, they being able to bear immense doses of it, in fact\r\nquite sufficient to produce death if given to a hearty man.\r\n\r\nThus we might continue to enumerate other drugs which we have\r\nascertained, from practical observation as well as the experiments of\r\nother, to exercise a peculiar action on the vital functions of the whole\r\ncanine race, quite at variance with that common to both man and the\r\nother domestic animals.\r\n\r\nIn combating with the diseases of animals, the veterinary surgeon has\r\nmore to contend with than the regular physician, and, in fact, should\r\npossess a knowledge and habit of observation even superior to the\r\nformer; although the responsibility of his calling, in a moral sense, is\r\nmuch inferior to that of the other, as the importance of animal\r\nexistence, under no circumstances, can be placed in comparison with that\r\nof human life: still acuteness of observation alone can direct him to\r\nthe main cause of suffering in the brute creation, as the animal, though\r\ngroaning under the most severe pains, cannot by any word of explanation\r\npoint out to us the seat, the probable cause, or peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of such pain. We see that our dog is ill, he refuses his\r\nfood, retires gloomily to his house, looks sullen, breathes heavy, is no\r\nlonger delighted at our call. We cannot question him as to his feelings,\r\nor ask him to point out the particular region of his sufferings; we\r\nwatch his motions, study his actions, and rely for our diagnosis upon\r\ngeneral symptoms deduced from close observation.\r\n\r\nBesides these external ocular evidences of morbid action, we have, as in\r\nthe human subject, guides to direct us in forming a just opinion as to\r\nthe nature of a dog's indisposition.\r\n\r\nThe state of the circulation is the first thing that should command our\r\nparticular attention.\r\n\r\nThe pulse of dogs in health varies from one hundred to one hundred and\r\ntwenty strokes per minute, according to the size and peculiar\r\ntemperament of the animal, being more frequent in the small breeds.\r\n\r\nThe standard of the setter, pointer, hound, &c., may be stated at one\r\nhundred and five.\r\n\r\nThe action of the heart may be felt by placing the hand immediately over\r\nthat organ, or applying the fingers to several points in the body and\r\nlimbs where the large arteries are somewhat superficial, as on the\r\ninside of the fore-knee and the thigh of the hind-leg.\r\n\r\nIf the pulse in a state of rest exceeds the average standard in\r\nfrequency, regularity, and softness, and a general feeling of uneasiness\r\nbe present, together with reddened eyes, warm nose, and coated tongue,\r\nwe know at once that there is an unnatural derangement of the vital\r\nfunctions, and that fever in some form is present. The next question to\r\ndetermine is, upon what does this fever depend? whether it be\r\nidiopathic, arising from morbific causes difficult to define, or whether\r\nit be sympathetic, with some organic affection yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the tongue in canine diseases will often materially\r\nassist us in forming a correct diagnosis; this organ in simple fever\r\nloses its rose-colour and becomes pale and coated, the gums and fæces\r\nalso participate in this change.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the tongue be much furred, with a bright inflammatory\r\nappearance around the edges, with high arterial excitement, and disgust\r\nof food, with general anxiety and craving for water in small but\r\nfrequent quantities, inflammation of the stomach or bowels may be\r\nsuspected. If, on the other hand, the tongue remains brown and streaked,\r\nwith less action of the pulse, variable appetite and diminution of pain,\r\nderangement of the liver may be apprehended.\r\n\r\nIf, in connection with some or all of the above symptoms, the breathing\r\nbe laboured and painful, with a disposition to remain in the erect or\r\nsitting position, with great anxiety and general distress, we must look\r\nto the pulmonic viscera as the seat of the disease.\r\n\r\nThus, by examining each and every individual symptom of disease, the\r\nintelligent sportsman will soon be able to arrive at the proximate cause\r\nof all this unnatural state of things, and then he will be competent to\r\nadminister such remedies as may seem most likely to afford relief.\r\nWithout these precautions, however, he would often be groping in the\r\ndark, and, consequently, not unfrequently, apply those remedies more\r\ncalculated to aggravate than cure the malady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE SKELETON.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM:--FITS; TURNSIDE, OR GIDDINESS, EPILEPSY;\r\nCHOREA; RHEUMATISM AND PALSY.\r\n\r\n[As with all the illustrations in this text, the canine skeleton and\r\nlegend to the diagram are displayed fully in the html version.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nFITS\r\n\r\n24th Feb. 1814.--A pug was accustomed to howl frequently when his young\r\nmaster played on the flute. If the higher notes were sounded, he would\r\nleap on his master's lap, look in his face, and howl vehemently. To-day\r\nthe young man purposely blew the shrillest sound that he could. The dog,\r\nafter howling three or four times, began to run round the room, and over\r\nthe tables and chairs, barking incessantly. This he continued more than\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw him all consciousness of surrounding objects was gone. He was\r\nstill running feebly, but barking might and main.\r\n\r\nI dashed a basin of cold water in his face, and he dropped as if he had\r\nbeen shot. He lay motionless nearly a minute, and then began to struggle\r\nand to bark; another cup of water was dashed in his face, and he lay\r\nquite motionless during two minutes or more. In the mean time I had got\r\na grain each of calomel and tartar emetic, which I put on his tongue,\r\nand washed it down with a little water. He began to recover, and again\r\nbegan to yelp, although much softer; but, in about a quarter of an hour,\r\nsickness commenced, and he ceased his noise. He vomited three or four\r\ntimes, and lay frightened and quiet. A physic-ball was given him in the\r\nevening, and on the following morning.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the young man put open the door, and sat himself down,\r\nand began to prepare the flute; the dog was out in a moment, and did not\r\nreturn during a couple of hours. On the following day he made his escape\r\nagain, and so the matter went on; but before the expiration of the week,\r\nhis master might play the flute if he pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNSIDE, OR GIDDINESS.\r\n\r\nThis is a singular disease prevalent among cattle, but only occasionally\r\nseen in the dog. He becomes listless, dull, off his food, and scarcely\r\nrecognises any surrounding object. He has no fit, but he wanders about\r\nthe room fur several hours at a time, generally or almost invariably in\r\nthe same direction, and with his head on one side. At first he carefully\r\navoids the objects that are in his way; but by degrees his mental\r\nfaculties become impaired; his sense of vision is confused or lost, and\r\nhe blunders against everything: in fact, if uninterrupted, he would\r\ncontinue his strange perambulation incessantly, until he was fairly worn\r\nout and died in convulsions.\r\n\r\nI used to consider the complaint to be uniformly fatal. I have resorted\r\nto every remedial measure that the case could suggest. I have bled, and\r\nphysicked and setoned, and blistered, and used the moxa; but all without\r\navail, for not in a single case did I save my patient.\r\n\r\nNo opportunity of 'post-mortem' examination was lost. In some cases I\r\nhave found spicula projecting from the inner plate of the skull, and\r\npressing upon or even penetrating the dura mater. I know not why the dog\r\nshould be more subject to these irregularities of cranial surface than\r\nany of our other patients; but decidedly he is so, and where they have\r\npressed upon the brain, there has been injection of the membranes, and\r\nsometimes effusion between them.\r\n\r\nIn some cases I have found effusion without this external pressure, and,\r\nin some cases, but comparatively few, there has not been any perceptible\r\nlesion. Hydatids have been found in the different passages leading to\r\nthe cranium, but they have not penetrated.\r\n\r\nI used to recommend that the dog should be destroyed; but I met with two\r\nor three favourable cases, and, after that, I determined to try every\r\nmeasure that could possibly be serviceable. I bled, and physicked, and\r\ninserted setons, and tried to prevent the utter exhaustion of the\r\nanimal. When he was unable longer to perform his circumvolutions, and\r\nfound that he was foiled, he laid himself down, and by degrees resumed\r\nhis former habits. He was sadly impatient and noisy; but in a few cases\r\nhe was cured.\r\n\r\n[We have seen but two or three cases of this disease in dogs, are led to\r\nbelieve that it is quite uncommon with our domestic animals. One case in\r\na valuable setter came on suddenly, and without any apparent cause\r\n(except perhaps over-feeding), and terminated fatally in the course of a\r\nfew days.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILEPSY\r\n\r\nin the dog assumes a most fatal character. It is an accompaniment, or a\r\nconsequence, of almost every other disease. When the puppy is undergoing\r\nthe process of dentition, the irritation produced by the pressure of the\r\ntooth, as it penetrates the gum, leads on to epilepsy. When he is going\r\nthrough the stages of distemper, with a very little bad treatment, or in\r\nspite of the best, fits occur. The degree of intestinal irritation which\r\nis caused by worms, is marked by an attack of epilepsy. If the usual\r\nexercise be neglected for a few days, and the dog is taken out, and\r\nsuffered to range as he likes, the accumulation of excitability is\r\nexpended in a fit.\r\n\r\nThe dog is, without doubt, the most intellectual animal. He is the\r\ncompanion and the friend of man: he exhibits, and is debased by some of\r\nhis vices; but, to a greater degree than many will allow, he exhibits\r\nall the intelligence and the virtues of the biped. In proportion to his\r\nbulk, the weight of his brain far exceeds that of any other\r\nquadruped--the very smallest animals alone being excepted, in whom there\r\nmust be a certain accumulation of medullary matter in order to give\r\norigin to the nerves of every system, as numerous in the minutest as in\r\nhim of greatest bulk.\r\n\r\nAs it has been said of the human being that great power and exertion of\r\nthe mental faculties are sometimes connected with a tendency to\r\nepilepsy, and, as violent emotions of joy or of grief have been known to\r\nbe followed by it, I can readily account for its occurrence in the young\r\ndog, when frightened at the chiding of his master, or by the dread of a\r\npunishment which he was conscious that he had deserved. Then, too, I can\r\nunderstand that, when breaking loose from long confinement, he ranges in\r\nall the exuberance of joy; and especially when he flushes almost his\r\nfirst covey, and the game falls dead before him, his mental powers are\r\nquite overcome, and he falls into an epileptic fit.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of epilepsy in the dog is simple, yet often misunderstood.\r\nIt is connected with distemper in its early stage. It is the produce of\r\ninflammation of the mucous passages generally, which an emetic and a\r\npurgative will probably, by their direct medicinal effect, relieve, and\r\nfree the digestive passages from some source of irritation, and by their\r\nmechanical action unburthen the respiratory ones.\r\n\r\nWhen it is symptomatic of a weak state of the constitution, or connected\r\nwith the after stages of distemper, the emeto-purgative must be\r\nsucceeded by an anodyne, or, at least, by that which will strengthen,\r\nbut not irritate the patient.\r\n\r\nA seton is an admirable auxiliary in epilepsy connected with distemper;\r\nit is a counter-irritant and a derivative, and its effects are a\r\nsalutary discharge, under the influence of which inflammation elsewhere\r\nwill gradually abate.\r\n\r\nI should, however, be cautious of bleeding in distemper fits. I should\r\nbe fearful of it even in an early stage, because I well know that the\r\nacute form of that general mucous inflammation soon passes over, and is\r\nsucceeded by a debility, from the depression of which I cannot always\r\nrouse my patient. When the fits proceed from dentition, I lance the\r\njaws, and give an emetic, and follow it up with cooling purgative\r\nmedicine. When they are caused by irregular and excessive exercise, I\r\nopen the bowels and make my exercise more regular and equable. When they\r\narise from excitation, I expose my patient more cautiously to the\r\ninfluence of those things which make so much impression on his little\r\nbut susceptible mind.\r\n\r\nIf the fit has resisted other means, bleeding should be resorted to. A\r\nfit in other animals is generally connected with dangerous determination\r\nof blood to the head, and bleeding is imperative. A fit in the dog may\r\nbe the consequence of sudden surprise and irritation. If I had the means\r\nI should see whether I could not break the charm; whether I could not\r\nget rid of the disturbance, by suddenly affecting the nervous system,\r\nand the system generally, in another way. I would seize him by the nape\r\nof the neck, and, with all my force, dash a little cold water in his\r\nface. The shock of this has often dispersed the epileptic agency, as it\r\nwere by magic. I would give an emeto-purgative; a grain or a grain and a\r\nhalf of calomel and the same quantity of tartar emetic: I would soothe\r\nand coax the poor animal. Then,--and if I saw it at the beginning, I\r\nwould do it early,--if the fit was more dependent upon, or was beginning\r\nto be connected with, determination of blood to the head, and not on any\r\ntemporary cause of excitation or irritation, I would bleed freely from\r\nthe jugular.\r\n\r\nThe following singular case of epilepsy is narrated by M.W. Leblanc:\r\n\r\nA dog of small size, three years old, was very subject to those\r\nepileptic fits that are so frequent among dogs. After a considerable\r\nperiod, the fits would cease, and the animal recover the appearance of\r\nperfect health; but the more he advanced in age the more frequent were\r\nthe fits, which is contrary to that which usually happens.\r\n\r\nThe last fit was a very strong one, and was followed by peculiar\r\nsymptoms. The animal became dispirited. The eyes lost their usual lively\r\nappearance, and the eyelids were often closed. The dog was very drowsy,\r\nand, during sleep, there were observed, from time to time, spasmodic\r\nmovements, principally of the head and chest. 'He always lay down on the\r\nleft side'. When he walked, he had a marked propensity to turn to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nM. Leblanc employed purgatives, a seton to the back part of the neck,\r\nand the application of the cautery to the left side of the forehead; but\r\nnothing would stop the progress of the disease, and he died in the\r\ncourse of two months after the last fit. The nearer he approached his\r\nend the smaller were the circles that he took; and, in the latter part\r\nof his existence, he did little more than turn as if he were on a pivot,\r\nand, when the time arrived that he could walk no more, he used to lay\r\nhimself down on the right side.\r\n\r\nOn the 'post-mortem' examination, a remarkable thickness of the meninges\r\nwas found on almost the whole of the left lobe of the brain. The dura\r\nmater, the two leaves of the arachnoid membrane, and the pia mater did\r\nnot constitute more than one membrane of the usual thickness, and\r\npresented a somewhat yellow colouring. The cerebral substance of the\r\nleft lobe appeared to be a little firmer than that of the right lobe.\r\nThe fissures of the cerebral devolutions were much less deep than those\r\nof the other side The red vessels which ran in the fissures were of\r\nsmaller size, and in some places could scarcely be discovered.\r\n\r\n[Confinement, over-feeding, blows on the head or spine, drying up of old\r\nulcers, repelling of cutaneous affections, or, in fact, anything that is\r\nliable to derange the general health of the animal, will produce\r\nepileptic fits.\r\n\r\nWe formerly had a beagle hound of very active temperament, which we were\r\nnecessarily obliged to keep much confined while in the city; and to\r\nrestrain her from running too wildly when taken into the streets, we\r\nwere in the habit of coupling her with a greyhound of much milder\r\ndisposition. Not being willing to submit lamely to this unpleasant check\r\nupon her liberty, she was ever making fruitless attempts to escape,\r\neither by thrusting herself forwards, or obstinately pulling backwards.\r\nThese efforts resulted on several occasions in fits, produced by\r\ncongestion of the brain, owing to the pressure of the collar on the\r\nneck, thereby interrupting the circulation, and inducing an influx of\r\nblood to those parts. We were ultimately obliged to abandon this method\r\nof restraint, which nearly proved fatal to our much-admired beagle: she\r\nbeing suddenly seized with one of these fits on a hot summer's day in\r\none of our principal thoroughfares, the crowd of ignorant bystanders\r\nconcluded it to be a case of rabies, and nothing but my taking her up in\r\nmy arms, and carrying her from the scene of action, saved her from\r\nfalling a victim to their ignorance.\r\n\r\nIf the disease appears dependent upon plethora the result of confinement\r\nand gross living, the animal must be reduced by bleeding and purging,\r\nlow diet, and exercise. If, however, the malady proceeds from weakness,\r\nas is sometimes the case in bitches while suckling a large litter, it\r\nwill be necessary to relieve her of some of the pups, and supply her\r\nwith the most nutritious diet, as also administer tonic balls; the\r\nfollowing will answer.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]:   Extract of Gentian, Quassia, ââ (each) grs. V, made into\r\ntwo pills, and one or two given morning and evening;\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]:   Powdered Columbo. Carbonate of Iron, ââ, grs. V, made\r\ninto two pills, and one given morning and evening, or more frequently if\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nA seton placed in the poll will often prevent these attacks,\r\nparticularly when depending upon slight cerebral irritation,\r\naccompanying distemper and mange. Blisters and frictions to the spine\r\nare also serviceable.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOREA.\r\n\r\nThis is an irregular reception or distribution of nervous power--a\r\nconvulsive involuntary twitching of some muscle or set of muscles. It is\r\nan occasional consequence of distemper that has been unusually severe or\r\nimperfectly treated, and sometimes it is seen even after that disease\r\nhas existed in its mildest form.\r\n\r\n[This nervous affection, more commonly known as St. Vitus' dance, is not\r\na rare disease, and we doubt not that examples of it have been seen by\r\nmost of our readers, more particularly in young dogs affected with\r\ndistemper.\r\n\r\nThis malady is characterized by sudden involuntary twitchings of the\r\ndifferent muscles of the body, the disease being sometimes confined to\r\none limb, sometimes to two, and frequently pervades the whole system,\r\ngiving the dog a distressing and painful appearance. These involuntary\r\nmotions, it is very true, are generally restricted during sleep,\r\nalthough in old chronic cases of long standing they often continue in\r\nfull activity without any remission whatever. The disease is not\r\nattended with fever, and all the functions generally remain for a\r\nconsiderable time unimpaired.--L.]\r\n\r\nIt first appears in one leg or shoulder, and is long, or perhaps\r\nentirely, confined to that limb. There is a singular spasmodic jerking\r\naction of the limb. It looks like a series of pulsations, and averages\r\nfrom forty to sixty in a minute. Oftener, perhaps, than otherwise, both\r\nlegs are similarly affected. When the animal is lying down, the legs are\r\nconvulsed in the way that I have described, and when he stands there is\r\na pulsating depressing or sinking of the head and neck. In some cases,\r\nthe muscles of the neck are the principal seat of the disease, or some\r\nmuscle of the face; the temporal muscle beating like an artery; the\r\nmasseter opening and closing the mouth, the muscles of the eyelid, and,\r\nin a few cases, those of the eye itself being affected. These convulsive\r\nmovements generally, yet not uniformly, cease during sleep, but that\r\nsleep is often very much disturbed. If the case is neglected, and the\r\ndog is in a debilitated state, this spasmodic action steals over the\r\nwhole frame, and he lies extended with every limb in constant and\r\nspasmodic action.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, such an expenditure of nervous and muscular\r\npower slowly destroys the strength of the animal, and he dies a mere\r\nskeleton; or the disease assumes the character of epilepsy, or it quiets\r\ndown into true palsy.\r\n\r\nIn the most favourable cases, no curative means having been used, the\r\ndog regains his flesh and general strength; but the chorea continues,\r\nthe spasmodic action, however, being much lessened. At other times, it\r\nseems to have disappeared; but it is ready to return when the animal is\r\nexcited or attacked by other disease. In a variety of instances, there\r\nis the irritable temper which accompanies chorea in the human being, and\r\nmost certainly when the disease has been extensive and confirmed.\r\n\r\nChorea, neglected or improperly treated, or too frequently pursuing its\r\nnatural course, degenerates into paralysis agitans. There is a tremulous\r\nor violent motion of almost every limb. The spasms are not relaxed, but\r\nare even increased during sleep, and when the animal awakes, he rises\r\nwith agitation and alarm. There is not a limb under the perfect control\r\nof the will; there is not a moment's respite; the constitution soon\r\nsinks, and the animal dies. No person should be induced to undertake the\r\ncure of such a case: the owner should be persuaded to permit a speedy\r\ntermination to a life which no skill can render comfortable.\r\n\r\nChorea is oftenest observed in young dogs, and especially after\r\ndistemper; and it seems to depend on a certain degree of primary or\r\nsympathetic inflammatory affection of the brain.\r\n\r\nChorea is often very plainly a consequence of debility: either the\r\ndistribution of nervous power is irregular, or the muscles have lost\r\ntheir power of being readily acted upon, or have acquired a state of\r\nmorbid irritability. The latter is the most frequent state. Their action\r\nis irregular and spasmodic, and it resembles the struggles of expiring\r\nnature far more than the great and uniform action of health. It is not\r\nthe chorea that used to be described, in which there was an irresistible\r\nimpulse to excessive action, and which was best combated by complete\r\nmuscular exhaustion; but the foundation of this disease is palpable\r\ndebility.\r\n\r\n[Rickets, bad feeding, cold and damp housing, worms in the alimentary\r\ncanal, mange, and other chronic affections, are all forerunners of this\r\nmalady.--L.]\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of chorea there must be no bleeding, no excessive\r\npurgation, but aperients or alteratives, merely sufficient to keep the\r\nfæces in a pultaceous state, so as to carry off any source of irritation\r\nto the intestinal canal, and particularly some species of worms, too\r\nfrequent sources of irritation there. To these should be added\r\nnutritious food, gentle exercise, tonic medicines, and general comforts.\r\nCounter-irritants may be applied--such as blisters over the head, and\r\nsetons, extending from poll to poll--the application of turpentine, or\r\nthe tincture of cantharides; but all of these will frequently be of no\r\neffect, and occasionally a rapid and fearful increase of irritability\r\nwill ensue: antispasmodics are in this case of no use, and narcotics are\r\naltogether powerless. As for tonics, iron and gentian have been\r\nserviceable to a certain extent, but they have never cured the\r\ncomplaint. The nitrate of silver will be the sheet-anchor of the\r\npractitioner, and if early used will seldom deceive him. It should be\r\ncombined with ginger, and given morning and night, in doses varying from\r\none-sixth to one-third of a grain, according to the size of the dog.\r\n\r\nThe condition and strength of the dog, and the season of the year, will\r\nbe our best guides. If the patient has not lost much flesh, and is not\r\nlosing it at the time that we have to do with him, and has few symptoms\r\nof general debility, and spring or summer are approaching we may with\r\ntolerable confidence predict a cure; but, if he has been rapidly losing\r\nground, and is doing so still, and staggers about and falls, there is no\r\nmedicine that will restore him.\r\n\r\n5th October, 1840.--A pointer, eighteen months old, had had the\r\ndistemper, but not severely, and was apparently recovering when he\r\nsuddenly lost all voluntary power over his limbs. He was unable to get\r\nup, and his legs were in constant, rapid, and violent motion. This\r\ncontinued three days, during which he had refused all food, when, the\r\ndog being in the country, my advice was asked. I ordered a strong emetic\r\nto be given to him, and after that a dose of Epsom salts, the insertion\r\nof a seton, and, in addition to this, our usual tonic was to be given\r\ntwice every day. His food to consist chiefly of good strong soup, which\r\nwas to be forced upon him in a sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\nIn two days he was able to get up and stagger about, although frequently\r\nfalling. His appetite returned. He continued to improve, and most\r\nrapidly gained strength and especially flesh. A very peculiar,\r\nhigh-lifting, clambering, and uncertain motion of the legs remained,\r\nwith an apparent defect of sight, for he ran against almost everything.\r\n\r\nIn six weeks the seton was removed, and the dog remained in the same\r\nstate until the 7th of December. The uncertain clambering motion was now\r\nincreasing, and likewise the defect of sight. He ran against almost\r\nevery person and every thing. The cornea was transparent, the iris\r\ncontracted, there was no opacity of the lens, or pink tint of the\r\nretina, but a peculiar glassy appearance, as unconscious of everything\r\naround it. An emetic was given, and, after that, an ounce of sulphate of\r\nmagnesia.\r\n\r\n8th. He was dreadfully ill after taking the salts; perhaps they were not\r\ngenuine. For two days he panted sadly, refused his food, and vomited\r\nthat which was forced upon him. His muzzle was hot; he could scarcely\r\nstand; he lost flesh very rapidly. An emetic was given immediately, and\r\na distemper-ball daily.\r\n\r\n16th. He soon began rapidly to recover, until he was in nearly the same\r\nstate as before, except that the sight was apparently more deficient.\r\nThe sulphate of magnesia was given every fourth day, and another seton\r\ninserted.\r\n\r\n21st. He continued the medicine, and evidently improved, the sight\r\nreturning, and the spasms being considerably less. The distemper-ball\r\nwas continued.\r\n\r\n4th January, 1841.--The spasms were better; but the vision did not\r\nimprove. In the afternoon he fell into a momentary fit. He almost\r\nimmediately rose again, and proceeded as if nothing had happened.  An\r\nounce of Epson salts was given, and then the tonic balls as before.\r\n\r\n22d. The spasms were lessened, the clambering gait nearly ceased, but\r\nthe vision was not improved. The seton was removed, and only an\r\nadditional dose of salts given.\r\n\r\n27th. The spasms suddenly and very considerably increased. The left side\r\nappeared now to be particularly affected. The left leg before and behind\r\nwere most spasmed, the right scarcely at all so. The vision of the left\r\neye was quite gone. The dog had been taken to Mr. Alexander's, the\r\noculist, who attributed the affection of the eye and the general\r\nspasmodic disease to some pressure on the brain, and recommended the\r\ntrial of copious and repeated bleeding.\r\n\r\n28th. The dog was dull; the spasms appeared to have somewhat increased\r\nand decidedly to affect the left side. Fever-balls were ordered to be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n29th. Considerable change took place. At three o'clock this morning I\r\nwas disturbed by a noise in the hospital. The poor fellow was in a\r\nviolent fit. Water was dashed in his face, and a strong emetic given;\r\nbut it was not until seven o'clock that the fit had ceased; he lay until\r\neleven o'clock, when the involuntary spasms were almost suspended. When\r\nhe was placed on his feet, he immediately fell; he then gradually\r\nrevived and staggered about. His master brought a physician to see him,\r\nwho adopted Mr. Alexander's idea and urged bleeding. Ten ounces of blood\r\nwere immediately taken; the dog refused to eat.\r\n\r\n1st February.--The strength of the animal was not impaired, but the\r\nspasms were more violent, and he lay or wandered about stupid and almost\r\nunconscious. I subtracted eight ounces more of blood.\r\n\r\n2d. The spasms were fully as violent, and no amendment in the vision.\r\nEight ounces more of blood were subtracted without benefit. A fever-ball\r\nwas ordered to be given.\r\n\r\n3d. No amendment; but the bleeding having been carried to its full\r\nextent, I again resorted to the tonic balls, which were given morning\r\nand night. The dog was well fed and the seton replaced.\r\n\r\n5th. A very considerable amendment is evident.\r\n\r\n9th. The spasms rapidly subsided and almost disappeared. Vision was not\r\nperfectly restored; but the dog evidently saw with his left eye. He was\r\ntaken away, and tonic balls sent with him and ordered to be continued.\r\n\r\n6th March.--The dog had improved in strength and no spasmodic affection\r\nremained; he likewise evidently saw with his left eye. The tonic-balls\r\nhad been discontinued for a week, and his master hoped that all would\r\nturn out well, when suddenly, while at home, he was seized with a fit\r\nthat lasted ten minutes. A strong emetic was given, which brought up a\r\nvast quantity of undigested food. A strong purging-ball was given to him\r\nin the evening.\r\n\r\n13th. The dog had lain slightly spasmed for two or three days, when they\r\nall at once ceased, and the animal appeared as well as before. Suddenly\r\nhe was taken with another fit, and again a vast quantity of food was\r\nvomited. These spasms remained two days, but on the 21st the fit\r\nreturned with the same discharge of food. Courses of purgatives were\r\nthen determined on. A strong dose of sulphate of magnesia was given\r\nevery third day. After four doses had been given, it was impossible to\r\nforce any more upon him. The syrup of buckthorn was tried, but the\r\nfourth dose of that it was impossible to give. The dog was then sent\r\ninto the country; no fit occurred, but there were occasional spasms.\r\n\r\n23d September.--He was brought back to town, and I saw him. During the\r\nlast month he had had many fits. His owner at length consented that the\r\nactual cautery should be applied to his head. The searing-iron for\r\ndoctoring was used, and applied red-hot to the centre of the head. It\r\nwas exceedingly difficult so to confine the dog as to make the\r\napplication effectual, without destroying the skin.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the sudden violent pain, he wandered about for\r\nmore than two hours, and then the spasms returned with greater force\r\nthan usual. He refused all food.\r\n\r\nWe determined to try the cautery to its full extent. We chained him up\r\nin the morning, and penetrated through the skin with the budding-iron.\r\nThe spasms were dreadfully violent, and he was scarcely able to walk or\r\nto stand. This gradually subsided, and then he began to run round and\r\nround, and that increased to an extraordinary velocity: he would then\r\nlie for a while with every limb in action. The owner then yielded to all\r\nour wishes, and he was destroyed with prussic acid. No morbid appearance\r\npresented itself in the brain; but, on the inner plate of the right\r\nparietal bone, near the sagittal suture, were two projections, one-sixth\r\nof an inch in length, and armed with numerous minute spicula. There was\r\nno peculiar inflammation or vascularity of any other part of the brain.\r\n\r\n[We once cured a case quite accidentally, by throwing a pup into a cold\r\nstream of water, and making him swim ashore; we do not recommend the\r\nplan, although we should be willing to try it again with one of our own\r\ndogs. The animal should be forced to swim till nearly exhausted, and\r\nwrapped up in blankets on coming out of the water. The intense alarm\r\ncreated in the pup, together with the violent struggle and coldness of\r\nthe water, all act as revulsives to the disease, which, if purely\r\nnervous, may be overcome by these powerful agents.\r\n\r\nIf the dog be weak, and the stomach deranged, the following tonic balls\r\nwill answer a good purpose:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]: Carbonate of Iron.\r\n\r\nGround Ginger, ââ, grs. X, made into two pills, one given morning and\r\nevening, or more frequently according to the age or size of the\r\nanimal.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM AND PALSY.\r\n\r\nI do not know any animal so subject to 'rheumatism' as the dog, nor any\r\none in which, if it is early and properly treated, it is so manageable.\r\n\r\n[We agree with our author, that the canine family are exceedingly liable\r\nto inflammation of the fibrous and muscular structures of the body, and\r\nthere is no disease from which they suffer more, both in their youth and\r\nold age, than rheumatism. No particular species of dogs are more subject\r\nto its attacks than others, all being alike victims to its ravages. Mr.\r\nBlaine remarks, that the bowels always sympathize with other parts of\r\nthe body suffering under this disease, and that inflammation will always\r\nbe found existing in the abdominal viscera, if rheumatism be present,\r\nand the lower bowels will be attended with a painful torpor, which he\r\ndesignates as rheumatic colic. We ourselves noticed, that old setters\r\nparticularly, when suffering from this disease, are frequently attacked\r\nwith an acute diarrhoea, or suffer from obstinate constipation attended\r\nby griping pains, but did not know that this state of things was so\r\nuniform an accompaniment to the other affection. There are two varieties\r\nof rheumatism, the 'acute' and 'chronic', both of which are attended\r\nwith either general fever or local inflammation. The attacks usually\r\ncome on rather suddenly, the joints swell, the pulse becomes full and\r\ntense, the parts tender, and the eyes blood-shot, the stomach deranged,\r\nand the bowels costive. Severe lancinating pain runs through the\r\narticulation, and along the course of the larger muscles, the tongue is\r\ncoated, the muzzle hot and dry, and the poor animal howls with agony.\r\nThe breathing becomes laboured, all food is rejected, and if you attempt\r\nto move the sufferer he sends forth piteous cries of distress. 'The\r\ncauses' of this serious affection are very numerous; among the most\r\nusual and active agents may be enumerated, exposure to atmospherical\r\nvicissitudes, remaining wet and idle after coming from the water, damp\r\nkennels, suppressed perspiration, metastasis of eruptive diseases,\r\nluxurious living, laziness and over-feeding. These and many other causes\r\nare all busy in the production of this disease. Duck dogs on the\r\nChesapeake, we have noticed as often suffering from this affection,\r\nowing no doubt to the great exposure they are obliged to endure; but few\r\nof them arrive at old age without being martyrs to the chronic form.\r\n'Chronic rheumatism', generally the result of the other form of disease,\r\nis most usually met with in old dogs: it is attended with little fever,\r\nalthough the local inflammation and swelling is sometimes considerable.\r\nThe pain is often stationary in one shoulder or loin, at other times\r\nshifts about suddenly to other portions of the body. The muscles are\r\ntender and the joints stiff, the animal seems lame till he becomes\r\nhealed, and limber when all appearance of the disease vanishes. In old\r\ncases the limbs become so much enlarged, and the joints so swollen, that\r\nthe dog is rendered perfectly useless, and consequently increases his\r\nsufferings by idleness. 'This form of the disease is known as gout.'\r\n\r\nTreatment of 'acute rheumatism'--bleeding largely is very important in\r\nthis affection, and if followed up with two or three purges of aloes,\r\ngamboge, colocynth and calomel will arrest the progress of this disease.\r\n\r\nRx.   Extract of Colocynth 3           [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n      Calomel                           grs. x.\r\n      Powdered Gamboge                  grs. ii.\r\n      Socet. Aloes                      grs. x.\r\n\r\nMade into four pills, two to be given at night, and the other the\r\nfollowing morning. If these medicines should not be handy, give a large\r\npurging ball of aloes, to be followed by a full dose of salts. When the\r\ninflammatory action is not sufficiently high to demand depletion, warm\r\nbathing, friction and keeping the dog wrapped up in blankets before a\r\nfire will generally afford relief. If the pain appear very severe, it\r\nwill be necessary to repeat the baths at short intervals: great\r\nattention must be paid to the state of the bowels: if a diarrhoea\r\nsupervenes, it must not he checked too suddenly, by the use of\r\nastringent medicines, but rather corrected by small doses of oil and\r\nmagnesia. If constipation attended with colic be the character of the\r\naffection, small quantities of oil and turpentine in connexion with warm\r\nenemata will be the proper remedies. If paralysis should occur, it will\r\nbe found very difficult to overcome, but must be treated, after the\r\nreduction of inflammation, upon principles laid down under the head of\r\nthis latter affection. Blisters to the spine, setons, electricity,\r\nacupuncturation, &c.\r\n\r\n'Treatment of chronic rheumatism'--warm baths are useful, and warm\r\nhousing absolutely necessary, attention to diet, and an occasional purge\r\nof blue mass and aloes, together with electricity, acupuncture,\r\nrubefacient applications to the spine, &c.--L.]\r\n\r\nA warm bath--perchance a bleeding--a dose or two of the castor-oil\r\nmixture, and an embrocation composed of spirit of turpentine, hartshorn,\r\ncamphorated spirit, and laudanum, will usually remove it in two or three\r\ndays, unless it is complicated with muscular sprains, or other lesions,\r\nsuch as the 'chest-founder' of kennels.\r\n\r\nThis chest-founder is a singular complaint, and often a pest in kennels\r\nthat are built in low situations, and where bad management prevails.\r\nWhere the huntsman or whippers-in are too often in a hurry to get home,\r\nand turn their dogs into the kennel panting and hot; where the beds are\r\nnot far enough from the floor, or the building, if it should be in a\r\nsufficiently elevated situation, has yet a northern aspect and is\r\nunsheltered from the blast, chest-founder prevails; and I have known\r\nhalf the pack affected by it after a severe run, the scent breast-high,\r\nand the morning unusually cold. It even occasionally passes on into\r\npalsy.\r\n\r\nThe veterinary surgeon will be sometimes consulted respecting this\r\nprovoking muscular affection. His advice will comprise--dryness,\r\nattention to the bowels, attention to the exercise-ground, and perhaps,\r\noccasionally, setons--not where the huntsman generally places them, on\r\nthe withers above, but on the brisket below, and defended from the teeth\r\nof the dog by a roller of a very simple construction, passing round the\r\nchest between the fore legs and over the front of the shoulders on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nThe pointer, somewhat too heavy before, and hardly worked, becomes what\r\nis called chest-foundered. From his very make it is evident that, in\r\nlong-continued and considerable exertion, the subscapular muscles will\r\nbe liable to sprain and inflammation. There will be inflammation of the\r\nfasciæ, induration, loss of power, loss of nervous influence and palsy.\r\nCattle, driven far and fast to the market, suffer from the same causes.\r\n\r\n[By palsy, we mean a partial or complete loss of the powers of motion or\r\nsensation in some portion of the muscular system: this affection is very\r\ncommon to the canine race, and very few of them reach an advanced age\r\nwithout having at some time in their life experienced an attack of this\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nThe loins and hind legs suffer oftener than other parts, in fact we do\r\nnot recollect ever meeting with paralysis of the fore limbs alone.\r\nAlthough the limbs become perfectly powerless, and are only dragged\r\nafter the animal by the combined efforts of the fore legs and back, it\r\nis seldom that they lose their sensibility.--L.]\r\n\r\nPalsy is frequent, as in the dog. However easy it may be to subdue a\r\nrheumatic affection, in its early stage, by prompt attention, yet if it\r\nis neglected, it very soon simulates, or becomes essentially connected\r\nwith, or converted into, palsy.\r\n\r\nNo animal presents a more striking illustration of the connexion between\r\nintestinal irritation and palsy than the dog. He rarely or never has\r\nenteritis, even in its mildest form, without some loss of power over the\r\nhinder extremities. This may at first arise from the participation of\r\nthe lumbar muscles with the intestinal irritation; but, if the disease\r\nof the bowels continues long, it will be evident enough that it is not\r\npain alone that produces the constrained and incomplete action of the\r\nmuscles of the hind extremities, but that there is an actual loss of\r\nnervous power. A dog is often brought to the veterinary surgeon, with no\r\napparent disease about him except a staggering walk from weakness of the\r\nhind limbs. He eats well and is cheerful, and his muzzle is moist and\r\ncool; but his belly is tucked up, and there are two longitudinal cords,\r\nrunning parallel to each other, which will scarcely yield to pressure.\r\nThe surgeon orders the castor-oil mixture twice or thrice daily, until\r\nthe bowels are well acted upon, and, as soon as that is accomplished,\r\nthe dog is as strong and as well as ever. Perhaps his hind limbs are\r\ndragged behind him; a warm bath is ordered, he is dosed well with the\r\ncastor-oil mixture, and, if it is a recent case, the animal is well in a\r\nfew days. In more confirmed palsy, the charge, or plaster on the loins,\r\nis added to the action of the aperient on the bowels. The process may be\r\nsomewhat slow, but it is seldom that the dog does not ultimately and\r\nperfectly recover.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to explain this connexion, although we should have scarcely\r\nsupposed that it would have been so intimate, had not frequent\r\nexperience forced it on our observation. The rectum passes through the\r\npelvis. Whatever may be said of that intestine, considering its vertical\r\nposition in the human being, it is always charged with fæces in the\r\nquadruped. It therefore shares more in the effect, whatever that may be,\r\nwhich is produced by the retention of fæces in the intestinal canal, and\r\nit shares also in the inflammatory affection of other parts of the\r\ncanal. Almost in contact with this viscus, or at least passing through\r\nthe pelvis, are the crural nerves from the lumbar vertebræ, the\r\nobtusator running round the rim of the pelvis, the glutal nerve\r\noccupying its back, and the sciatic hastening to escape from it. It is\r\nnot difficult to imagine that these, to a certain degree, will\r\nsympathize with the healthy and also the morbid state of the rectum; and\r\nthat, when it is inert, or asleep, or diseased, they also may be\r\npowerless too. Here is something like fact to establish a very important\r\ntheory, and which should be deeply considered by the sportsman and the\r\nsurgeon.\r\n\r\n[Loss of the contractile power of the sphincters of the bladder and\r\nrectum, sometimes attends this disease, and involuntary evacuations are\r\nconstantly taking place, or costiveness and retention are the\r\nconsequences.--L.]\r\n\r\nMr. Dupuy has given a valuable account of the knowledge we possess of\r\nthe diseases of the spinal marrow in our domestic quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nHe has proved:\r\n\r\n1. That in our domestic animals the spinal marrow is scarcely ever\r\naffected through the whole of its course.\r\n\r\n2. That the dorsal and lumbar regions are the parts oftenest affected.\r\n\r\n3. That inflammation of the spinal marrow of these regions always\r\nproduces palsy, more or less complete, of the abdominal members.\r\n\r\n4. That, in some cases, this inflammation is limited to the inferior or\r\nsuperior parts of the spinal marrow, and that there is loss only of\r\nfeeling or of motion.\r\n\r\n5. That sometimes animals die of palsy without any organic lesion.\r\n\r\n[Blows on the head, producing effusion on the brain, poisoning by lead,\r\ninflammation of the spinal marrow, affections of the nerves, caries of\r\nthe spine, costiveness and affections of the bowels, are all productive\r\nof palsy. If the disease proceeds from rheumatism, or other inflammatory\r\naffections, independent of any organic lesion, the disease, if taken\r\nearly, is not difficult to overcome in the young subject. Warm baths,\r\nbleeding, purging, and stimulating applications to the parts and along\r\nthe spine, will answer. Castor oil and turpentine is a good purge: where\r\nthe malady depends upon costiveness, purges of aloes should be\r\nadministered in connexion with warm enemata, stimulating frictions along\r\nthe spine, and hot baths. Croton oil dropped on the tongue will also be\r\nof great benefit: if there should be effusion or compression from\r\nfracture of the bones of the cranium, nothing but trephining will be of\r\nany service, as we can hardly hope for the absorption of the matter, and\r\nthe removal of the spicula of bone can alone afford relief to the\r\npatient. Paralysis arising from poisoning should be treated as described\r\nunder the head of mineral poisons. Chronic cases of paralysis arising\r\nfrom want of tone of the nerves and spinal marrow, repeated blistering,\r\nintroduction of the seton along the spine, electricity, &c., have all\r\nbeen tried with some success.\r\n\r\nStrychnia, from its peculiar effects upon the animal economy, and its\r\nalmost exclusive direction to the nerves of motion, makes it a medicine\r\nparticularly applicable to the treatment of this disease. It may be\r\ngiven in all stages of the malady, but is most serviceable after the\r\nreduction of inflammatory action, and when we are convinced that the\r\ndisease depends upon want of tone in the motor muscles.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be had in its administration, as it is a powerful\r\npoison in too large doses, to a large dog; commence with a quarter of a\r\ngrain in pill, three times daily, and gradually increase to a half grain\r\nor more if the animal seems to bear it well. But it should be\r\ndiscontinued immediately on the appearance of any constitutional\r\nsymptoms, such as spasmodic twitchings of the eyelids or muzzle.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPALSY--MANGE\r\n\r\n11th February, 1835.--A Persian bitch, at the Zoological Gardens, who\r\nwas well yesterday, now staggers as she walks, and has nearly lost the\r\nuse of her hind legs. Gave a good dose of the castor-oil mixture.\r\n\r\n18th. She is materially worse and drags her hind legs after her. I would\r\nfain put on a charge, but the keeper does not like that her beautiful\r\ncoat should be spoiled, and wishes to try what gentle exercise will do.\r\nShe certainly, after she has been coaxed a great deal, will get on her\r\nlegs and stagger on fifty yards or more. Gave the castor-oil mixture\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n19th. She is a little stronger, and walks a little better. Continue the\r\nmixture. Embrocate well with the rheumatic mixture--sp. tereb., sp.\r\ncamph., liq. ammon., et tinct. opii--and give gentle exercise.\r\n\r\n2d March.--She does improve, although slowly; the charge is therefore\r\npostponed. Continue treatment.\r\n\r\n30th. She is considerably better. Continue the mixture, and use the\r\nembrocation every second day.\r\n\r\n10th April--She has mange in the bend of her arm, and on her chest. Use\r\nthe sulphur ointment and alterative balls, and omit the embrocation and\r\nmixture. In less than a week she nearly recovered from her lameness, and\r\nran about almost as well as ever.\r\n\r\n30th. She runs about very fairly, but the mange has assumed that\r\ncharacter of scurvy which I do not know how to grapple with. Continue\r\nthe alterative balls, and the ointment.\r\n\r\n18th May.--The mange has disappeared, but the palsy is returning; she\r\nstaggers slightly, and droops behind. Give the castor-oil mixture and\r\nuse the embrocation.\r\n\r\n14th June.--Mange quite gone, but palsy continues to a very considerable\r\ndegree. I want to use the plaster; but the keeper pleads for a little\r\ndelay. Continue the treatment.\r\n\r\n1st July.--I have at length determined to have recourse to the charge. A\r\npiece of thick sheep's leather was fitted lo her loins and haunches.\r\n18th. She appears to be improving, but it is very slowly.\r\n\r\n31st. Very little change. The plaster keeps on well: she has no power\r\nover her hind limbs; but she eats and drinks as well as ever.\r\n\r\n23d August.--No change. Give her half a grain of strychnia, morning and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n26th That singular secretion of milk, to which the bitch is subject nine\r\nweeks after oestrum, is now appearing. Her mammæ are enlarged, and I\r\ncan squeeze a considerable quantity of milk out of the teats. Give an\r\naloetic pill, and continue the strychnia.\r\n\r\n31st. The secretion of milk continues. There is slight enlargement and\r\nsome heat of the mammæ; but she feeds as well as ever. Increase the\r\ndose of strychnia to three-quarters of a grain.\r\n\r\nOn the following day she was found dead. In making the usual\r\nlongitudinal incision through the integuments of the abdomen a\r\nconsiderable quantity of milky fluid, mingled with blood, followed the\r\nknife. There was very slight enlargement of the teats, but intense\r\ninflammation of the whole of the mammary substance. The omentum, and\r\nparticularly the portion opposite to the external disease, was also\r\ninflamed. Besides this there was not a vestige of disease.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting case and deserves record. I fear that justice was\r\nnot done to the animal at the commencement of the paralytic affection.\r\nIn nineteen cases out of twenty in the dog, the constant but mild\r\nstimulus of a charge over the lumbar and sacral regions removes the\r\ndeeper-seated inflammation of the spinal cord or its membranes, when the\r\npalsy is confined to the hind extremities, and has not been sufficiently\r\nlong established to produce serious change of structure. The charge\r\nshould have been applied at first. The almost total disappearance of the\r\npalsy during the cutaneous disease, which was attended with more than\r\nusual inflammation of the integument, is an instructive illustration of\r\nthe power of counter-irritation, and of what might possibly have been\r\neffected in the first case; for much time was lost before the\r\napplication of the charge, and when at length it was applied, it and the\r\nstrychnia were powerless.\r\n\r\nI consider the following case as exceedingly valuable, at least with\r\nreference to the power of strychnia in removing palsy:--\r\n\r\n19th August, 1836.--A fine Alpine dog was suddenly attacked with a\r\nstrange nervous affection. He was continually staggering about and\r\nfalling. His head was forcibly bent backward and a little on one side,\r\nalmost to his shoulder. A pound of blood was abstracted, a seton\r\ninserted from ear to ear, and eight grains of calomel administered.\r\n\r\n21st. He has perfectly lost the use of every limb. He has also\r\namaurosis. perfect blindness, which had not appeared the day before. He\r\nhears perfectly, and he eats, and with appetite, when the food is put\r\ninto his mouth. Gave him two large spoonfuls of the castor-oil mixture\r\ndaily; this consists of three parts of castor-oil, two of syrup of\r\nbuck-thorn, and one of syrup of white poppies.\r\n\r\n23d. A little better; can lift his head and throw it upon his side, and\r\nwill still eat when fed. Continue the mixture, and give half a grain of\r\nstrychnia daily.\r\n\r\n24th. Little change.\r\n\r\n27th. No change, except that he is rapidly losing flesh. Continue the\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n31th. The strychnia increased to three-fourths of a grain morning and\r\nnight. The castor-oil mixture continued in its full quantity.  He was\r\nfed well, but there was a sunken, vacant expression of countenance.\r\n\r\n2d September.--He can move his head a little, and has some slight motion\r\nin his limbs.\r\n\r\n4th. He can almost get up. He recognises me for the first time. His\r\nappetite, which was never much impaired, has returned: this is to be\r\nattributed to strychnia, or the seton, or the daily aperient mixture.\r\nThey have all, perhaps, been serviceable, but I attribute most to the\r\nstrychnia; for I have rarely, indeed, seen any dog recover from such an\r\nattack. Continue the treatment.\r\n\r\n6th. Fast recovering. Medicine as before.\r\n\r\n14th. Improving, but not so fast as before. Still continue the\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n28th. Going on slowly, but satisfactorily. Remove the seton, but\r\ncontinue the other treatment.\r\n\r\n13th October.--Quite well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nRABIES.\r\n\r\nWe are now arrived at one of the most important subjects in veterinary\r\npathology. In other cases the comfort and the existence of our quadruped\r\npatients are alone or chiefly involved, but here the lives of our\r\nemployers, and our own too, are at stake, and may be easily, and too\r\noften are, compromised. Here also, however other portions of the chain\r\nmay be overlooked or denied, we have the link which most of all connects\r\nthe veterinary surgeon with the practitioner of human medicine; or,\r\nrather, here is the circumscribed but valued spot where the veterinary\r\nsurgeon has the vantage-ground.\r\n\r\nIn describing the nature, and cause and treatment of rabies, it will be\r\nmost natural to take the animal in which it oftenest appears, by which\r\nit is most frequently propagated; the time at which the danger\r\ncommences, and the usual period before the death of the patient.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a dog, naturally ferocious, bit a child at Lisson Grove.\r\nThe child, to all appearance previously well, died on the third day, and\r\nan inquest was to be held on the body in the evening. The Coroner\r\nordered the dog to be sent to me for examination The animal was,\r\ncontrary to his usual habit, perfectly tractable. This will appear to be\r\nof some importance hereafter. I examined him carefully. No suspicious\r\ncircumstance could be found about him. There was no appearance of\r\nrabies. In the mean time the inquest took place, and the corpse of the\r\nchild was carefully examined. One medical gentleman thought that there\r\nwere some suspicious appearances about the stomach, and another believed\r\nthat there was congestion of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the dog begged that the animal might not be taken from him,\r\nbut might accompany him home. He took him home and destroyed him that no\r\nexperiments might be made.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty we procured the carcass, and from some\r\ninflammatory appearances about the tongue and the stomach, and the\r\npresence of a small portion of indigestible matter in the stomach, we\r\nwere unanimously of opinion that the dog was rabid.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that the child died hydrophobous, or that its death\r\nwas accelerated by the nascent disease existing in the dog. There was\r\nprobably some nervous affection that hastened the death of the infant,\r\nand the dog bit the child at the very period when the malady first began\r\nto develop itself. On the following day there were morbid lesions enough\r\nto prove beyond doubt that he was rabid.\r\n\r\nThis case is introduced because I used afterwards to accompany every\r\nexamination of supposed or doubtful rabies with greater caution than I\r\nprobably had previously used.\r\n\r\nIt is occasionally very difficult to detect the existence of rabies in\r\nits nascent state. In the year 1813, a child attempted to rob a dog of\r\nits morning food, and the animal resisting the theft, the child was\r\nslightly scratched by its teeth. No one dreamed of danger. Eight days\r\nafterwards symptoms of rabies appeared in the dog, the malady ran its\r\ncourse, and the animal died. A few days afterwards the child\r\nsickened--undoubted characteristics of rabies were observed--they ran\r\ntheir course and the infant was lost.\r\n\r\nThere are other cases--fortunately not numerous--in the records of human\r\nsurgery, resembling this. A person has been bitten by a dog, he has paid\r\nlittle or no attention to it, and no application of the caustic has been\r\nmade. Some weeks, or even months, have passed, he has nearly or quite\r\nforgotten the affair, when he becomes languid and feverish, and full of\r\nfearful apprehensions, and this appearing perhaps during several days,\r\nor more than a week. The empoisonment has then ceased to be a local\r\naffair, the virus has entered into the circulation, and its impression\r\nis made on the constitution generally. Fortunately the disposition to\r\nbite rarely develops itself until the full establishment of the disease,\r\notherwise we might sometimes inquire whether it were not our duty to\r\nexterminate the whole race of dogs.\r\n\r\nThe following case deserves to be recorded. On the 21st of October,\r\n1813, a dog was brought to me for examination. He had vomited a\r\nconsiderable quantity of coagulated blood. I happened to be particularly\r\nbusy at the moment, and not observing anything peculiar in his\r\ncountenance or manner, I ordered some astringent sedative medicine, and\r\nsaid that I would see him again in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon he was again brought. The vomiting had\r\nquite ceased. His mouth seemed to be swollen, and, on examining him, I\r\nfound that some of his incisor teeth, both in the upper and lower jaw,\r\nhad been torn out. This somewhat alarmed me; and, on inquiring of the\r\nservant, I was told that he suspected that they had had thieves about\r\nthe house on the preceding night, for the dog had torn away the side of\r\nhis kennel in attempting to get at them. I scolded him for not having\r\ntold me of this in the morning; and then, talking of various things, in\r\norder to prolong the time and to be able closely to watch my patient, I\r\nsaw, or thought I saw, but in a very slight degree, that the animal was\r\ntracing the fancied path of some imaginary object. I was then truly\r\nalarmed, and more especially since I had discovered that in the giving\r\nof the physic in the morning the man's hand had been scratched; a youth\r\nhad suffered the dog to lick his sore finger, and the animal had also\r\nbeen observed to lick the sore ear of an infant. He was a remarkably\r\naffectionate dog, and was accustomed to this abominable and inexcusable\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\nI insisted on detaining the dog, and gave the man a letter to the\r\nsurgeon, telling him all my fears. He promptly acted on the hint, and\r\nbefore evening, the proper means were taken with regard to all three.\r\n\r\nI watched this dog day after day. He would not eat, but he drank a great\r\ndeal more water than I liked. The surgeon was evidently beginning to\r\ndoubt whether I was not wrong, but he could not dispute the occasional\r\nwandering of the eye, and the frequent spume upon the water. On the 26th\r\nof October, however, the sixth day after his arrival, we both of us\r\nheard the rabid howl burst from him: he did not, however, die until the\r\n30th. I mention this as another instance of the great difficulty there\r\nis to determine the real nature of the case in an early stage of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nM. Perquin relates an interesting case. A lady had a greyhound, nine\r\nyears old, that was accustomed to lie upon her bed at night, and cover\r\nhimself with the bed-clothes. She remarked, one morning, that he had\r\ntorn the covering of his bed, and, although he ate but little, drank\r\noftener, and in larger quantity, than he was accustomed to do. She led\r\nhim to a veterinary surgeon, who assured her that there was nothing\r\nserious the matter. On the following day, he bit her fore-finger near\r\nthe nail, as she was giving him something to eat. She led him again to\r\nthe veterinary surgeon, who assured her that she needed not to be under\r\nthe least alarm, and as for the little wound on her finger, it was of no\r\nconsequence. On the following day, the 27th of December, the dog died.\r\nHe had not ceased to drink most abundantly to the very last.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of February, as the lady was dining with her husband, she\r\nfound some difficulty in deglutition. She wished to take some wine, but\r\nwas unable to swallow it.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th, she consulted a surgeon. He wished her to swallow a little\r\nsoup in his presence. She attempted to do it, but could not accomplish\r\nher object after many an effort. She then fell into a state of violent\r\nagitation, with constriction of the pharynx, and the discharge of a\r\nviscid fluid from the mouth.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, she died, four days after the first attack of the disease,\r\nand in a state of excessive loss of flesh.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that both the dog and his mistress died rabid, the\r\nformer having communicated the disease to the latter; but there is no\r\nsatisfactory account of the manner in which the dog became diseased. [1]\r\n\r\nJoseph Delmaire, of Looberghe, twenty-nine years old, was, on the 6th of\r\nOctober, 1836, bitten in the hand by a dog that he met with in the\r\nforest, and that was evidently rabid. On the following morning, he went\r\nto a medical man of some repute in the country, who washed the wound,\r\nand scarified it, and terminated the operation by tracing a bloody cross\r\non the forehead of the patient.\r\n\r\nHe returned home, but he was far from being satisfied. The image of the\r\ndog that had attacked him was always before him, and his sleep was\r\ntroubled with the most frightful dreams. So passed four-and-twenty days,\r\nwhen Delmaire, rising from his bed, felt the most dreadful trepidation;\r\nhe panted violently; it seemed as if an enormous weight oppressed his\r\nchest, and from time to time there was profound sighing and sobbing. He\r\ncomplained every moment that he was smothered. He attempted to drink,\r\nbut it was with great difficulty that a few drops of barley-water were\r\nswallowed. His mouth was dry, his throat burning, his thirst excessive,\r\nand all that he attempted to swallow was rejected with horror.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock at night he was largely bled. His respiration was more\r\nfree, but the dread of every fluid remained. After an hour's repose, he\r\nstarted and felt the most fearful pain in every limb--his whole body was\r\nagitated with violent convulsions. The former place of bleeding was\r\nreopened, and a great quantity of blood escaped. The pulse became small\r\nand accelerated. The countenance was dreadful--the eyes were starting\r\nfrom their sockets--he continually sprung from his seat and uttered the\r\nmost fearful howling. A quantity of foam filled his mouth, and compelled\r\na continued expectoration. In his violent fits, the strength of six men\r\nwas not sufficient to keep him on his bed. In the midst of a sudden\r\nrecess of fury he would disengage himself from all that were attempting\r\nto hold him, and dash himself on the floor; there, freed from all\r\ncontrol, he rolled about, beat himself, and tore everything that he\r\ncould reach. In the short intervals that separated these crises, he\r\nregained possession of his reasoning powers: he begged his old father to\r\npardon him, he talked to him and to those around with the most intense\r\naffection, and it was only when he felt that a new attack was at hand,\r\nthat he prayed them to leave him. At length his mental excitation began\r\nto subside; his strength was worn out, and he suffered himself to be\r\nplaced on his bed. The horrible convulsions from time to time returned,\r\nbut the dread of liquors had ceased. He demanded something to drink.\r\nThey gave him a little white wine, but he was unable to swallow it; it\r\nwas returned through his nostrils. The poor fellow then endeavoured to\r\nsleep; but it was soon perceived that he had ceased to live.\r\n\r\nThe early symptoms of rabies in the dog are occasionally very obscure.\r\nIn the greater number of cases, these are sullenness, fidgetiness, and\r\ncontinual shifting of posture. Where I have had opportunity, I have\r\ngenerally found these circumstances in regular succession. For several\r\nconsecutive hours perhaps he retreats to his basket or his bed. He shows\r\nno disposition to bite, and he answers the call upon him laggardly. He\r\nis curled up and his face is buried between his paws and his breast. At\r\nlength he begins to be fidgety. He searches out new resting-places; but\r\nhe very soon changes them for others. He takes again to his own bed; but\r\nhe is continually shifting his posture. He begins to gaze strangely\r\nabout him as he lies on his bed. His countenance is clouded and\r\nsuspicious. He comes to one and another of the family and he fixes on\r\nthem a steadfast gaze as if he would read their very thoughts. \"I feel\r\nstrangely ill,\" he seems to say: \"have you anything to do with it? or\r\nyou? or you?\" Has not a dog mind enough for this? If we have observed a\r\nrabid dog at the commencement of the disease, we have seen this to the\r\nvery life.\r\n\r\nThere is a species of dog--the small French poodle--the essence of whose\r\ncharacter and constitution is fidgetiness or perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nIf this dog has been bitten, and rabies is about to establish itself, he\r\nis the most irritative restless being that can be conceived of; starting\r\nconvulsively at the slightest sound; disposing of his bed in every\r\ndirection, seeking out one retreat after another in order to rest his\r\nwearied frame, but quiet only for a moment in any one, and the motion of\r\nhis limbs frequently stimulating chorea and even epilepsy.\r\n\r\nA peculiar delirium is an early symptom, and one that will never\r\ndeceive. A young man had been bitten by one of his dogs; I was requested\r\nto meet a medical gentleman on the subject: I was a little behind my\r\ntime; as I entered the room I found the dog eagerly devouring a pan of\r\nsopped bread. \"There is no madness here,\" said the gentleman. He had\r\nscarcely spoken, when in a moment the dog quitted the sop, and, with a\r\nfurious bark sprung against the wall as if he would seize some imaginary\r\nobject that he fancied was there. \"Did you see that?\" was my reply.\r\n\"What do you think of it?\" \"I see nothing in it,\" was his retort: \"the\r\ndog heard some noise on the other side of the wall.\" At my serious\r\nurging, however, he consented to excise the part. I procured a poor\r\nworthless cur, and got him bitten by this dog, and carried the disease\r\nfrom this dog to the third victim: they all became rabid one after the\r\nother, and there my experiment ended. The serious matter under\r\nconsideration, perhaps, justified me in going so far as I did.\r\n\r\nThis kind of delirium is of frequent occurrence in the human patient.\r\nThe account given by Dr. Bardsley of one of his patients is very\r\nappropriate to on profit purpose:\r\n\r\n  \"I observed that he frequently fixed his eyes with horror and affright\r\n  on some ideal object, and then, with a sudden and violent emotion,\r\n  buried his head beneath the bed-clothes. The next time I saw him\r\n  repeat this action, I was induced to inquire into the cause of his\r\n  terror. He asked whether I had not heard howlings and scratchings. On\r\n  being answered in the negative, he suddenly threw himself on his\r\n  knees, extending his arms in a defensive posture, and forcibly threw\r\n  back his head and body. The muscles of the face were agitated by\r\n  various spasmodic contractions; his eye-balls glazed, and seemed ready\r\n  to start from their sockets; and, at the moment, when crying out in an\r\n  agonizing tone, 'Do you not see that black dog?' his countenance and\r\n  attitude exhibited the most dreadful picture of complicated horror,\r\n  distress, and rage that words can describe or imagination paint.\"\r\n\r\nI have again and again seen the rabid dog start up after a momentary\r\nquietude, with unmingled ferocity depicted on his countenance, and\r\nplunge with a savage howl to the end of his chain. At other times he\r\nwould stop and watch the nails in the partition of the stable in which\r\nhe was confined, and fancying them to move he would dart at them, and\r\noccasionally sadly bruise and injure himself from being no longer able\r\nto measure the distance of the object. In one of his sudden fits of\r\nviolence a rabid dog strangled the Cardinal Crescence, the Legate of the\r\nPope, at the Council of Trent in 1532.\r\n\r\nM. Magendie has often injected into the veins of an hydrophobous dog as\r\nmuch as five grains of opium without producing any effect; while a\r\nsingle grain given to the healthy dog would suffice to send him almost\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Babington's patients thought that there was a cloud of flies\r\nabout him. \"Why do you not kill those flies!\" he would cry; and then he\r\nwould strike at them with his hand, and shrink under the bed-clothes, in\r\nthe most dreadful fear.\r\n\r\nThere is also in the human being a peculiarity in this delirium which\r\nseems to distinguish it from every other kind of mental aberration.\r\n\r\n  \"The patient,\" in Mr. Lawrence's language, \"is pursued by a thousand\r\n  phantoms that intrude themselves upon his mind; he holds conversation\r\n  with imaginary persons; he fancies himself surrounded with\r\n  difficulties, and in the greatest distress. These thoughts seem to\r\n  pass through his mind with wonderful rapidity, and to keep him in a\r\n  state of the greatest distress, unless he is quickly spoken to or\r\n  addressed by his name, and, then, in a moment the charm is broken;\r\n  every phantom of imagination disappears, and at once he begins to talk\r\n  as calmly and as connectedly as in perfect health.\"\r\n\r\nSo it is with the dog, whether he is watching the motes that are\r\nfloating in the air, or the insects that are annoying him on the walls,\r\nor the foes that he fancies are threatening him on every side--one word\r\nrecalls him in a moment. Dispersed by the magic influence of his\r\nmaster's voice, every object of terror disappears, and he crawls towards\r\nhim with the same peculiar expression of attachment that used to\r\ncharacterize him.\r\n\r\nThen comes a moment's pause--a moment of actual vacuity--the eye slowly\r\ncloses, the head droops, and he seems as if his fore feet were giving\r\nway, and he would fall: but he springs up again, every object of terror\r\nonce more surrounds him--he gazes wildly around--he snaps--he barks, and\r\nhe rushes to the extent of his chain, prepared to meet his imaginary\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the countenance of the dog undergoes a considerable\r\nchange, principally dependent on the previous disposition of the animal.\r\nIf he was naturally of an affectionate disposition, there will be an\r\nanxious, inquiring countenance, eloquent, beyond the power of resisting\r\nits influence. It is made up of strange suppositions as to the nature of\r\nthe depression of mind under which he labours, mingled with some passing\r\ndoubts, and they are but passing, as to the concern which the master has\r\nin the affair; but, most of all, there is an affectionate and confiding\r\nappeal for relief. At the same time we observe some strange fancy,\r\nevidently passing through his mind, unalloyed, however, by the slightest\r\nportion of ferocity.\r\n\r\nIn the countenance of the naturally savage brute, or him that has been\r\ntrained to be savage, there is indeed a fearful change; sometimes the\r\nconjunctiva is highly injected; at other times it is scarcely affected,\r\nhut the eyes have an unusually bright and dazzling appearance. They are\r\nlike two balls of fire, and there is a peculiar transparency of the\r\nhyaloid membrane, or injection of that of the retina.\r\n\r\nA very early symptom of rabies in the dog, is an extreme degree of\r\nrestlessness. Frequently, he is almost invariably wandering about,\r\nshifting from corner to corner, or continually rising up and lying down,\r\nchanging his posture in every possible way, disposing of his bed with\r\nhis paws, shaking it with his mouth, bringing it to a heap, on which he\r\ncarefully lays his chest, or rather the pit of his stomach, and then\r\nrising up and bundling every portion of it out of the kennel. If he is\r\nput into a closed basket, he will not be still for an instant, but turn\r\nround and round without ceasing. If he is at liberty, he will seem to\r\nimagine that something is lost, and he will eagerly search round the\r\nroom, and particularly every corner of it, with strange violence and\r\nindecision.\r\n\r\nIn a very great portion of cases of hydrophobia in the human being,\r\nthere is, as a precursory symptom, uneasiness, pain, or itching of the\r\nbitten part. A red line may also be traced up the limb, in the direction\r\nof the lymphatics. In a few cases the wound opens afresh.\r\n\r\nThe poison is now beginning fatally to act on the tissue, on which it\r\nhad previously lain harmless. When the conversation has turned on this\r\nsubject, long after the bitten part has been excised, pain has darted\r\nalong the limb. I have been bitten much oftener than I liked, by dogs\r\ndecidedly rabid, but, proper means being taken, I have escaped; and yet\r\noften, when I have been over-fatigued, or a little out of temper, some\r\nof the old sores have itched and throbbed, and actually become red and\r\nswollen.\r\n\r\nThe dog appears to suffer a great deal of pain in the ear in common\r\ncanker. He will be almost incessantly scratching it, crying piteously\r\nwhile thus employed. The ear is, oftener than any other part, bitten by\r\nthe rabid dog, and, when a wound in the ear, inflicted by a rabid dog,\r\nbegins to become painful, the agony appears to be of the intensest kind.\r\nThe dog rubs his ear against every projecting body, he scratches it\r\nmight and main, and tumbles over and over while he is thus employed.\r\n\r\nThe young practitioner should be on his guard there. Is this dreadful\r\nitching a thing of yesterday, or, has the dog been subject to canker,\r\nincreasing for a considerable period. Canker both internal and external\r\nis a disease of slow growth, and must have been long neglected before it\r\nwill torment the patient in the manner that I have described. The\r\nquestion as to the length of time that an animal has thus suffered will\r\nusually be a sufficient guide.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which he expresses his torture will serve as another\r\ndirection. He will often scratch violently enough when he has canker,\r\nbut he will not roll over and over like a football except he is rabid.\r\nIf there is very considerable inflammation of the lining membrane of the\r\near, and engorgement and ulceration of it, this is the effect of canker;\r\nbut if there is only a slight redness of the membrane, or no redness at\r\nall, and yet the dog is incessantly and violently scratching himself, it\r\nis too likely that rabies is at hand.\r\n\r\nIn the early stage of rabies, the attachment of the dog towards his\r\nowner seems to be rapidly increased, and the expression of that feeling.\r\nHe is employed, almost without ceasing, licking the hands, or face, or\r\nany part he can get at. Females, and men too, are occasionally apt to\r\npermit the dog, when in health, to indulge this filthy and very\r\ndangerous habit with regard to them. The virus, generated under the\r\ninfluence of rabies, is occasionally deposited on a wounded or abraded\r\nsurface, and in process of time produces a similar disease in the person\r\nthat has been so inoculated by it. Therefore it is that the surgeon so\r\nanxiously inquires of the person that has been bitten, and of all those\r\nto whom the dog has had access, \"Has he been accustomed to lick you?\r\nhave you any sore places about you that can by possibility have been\r\nlicked by him?\" If there are, the person is in fully as much danger as\r\nif he had been bitten, and it is quite as necessary to destroy the part\r\nwith which the virus may have come in contact. A lady once lost her life\r\nby suffering her dog to lick a pimple on her chin.\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful species of dog, often the inhabitant of the\r\ngentleman's stable--the Dalmatian or coach dog. He has, perhaps, less\r\naffection for the human species than any other dog, except the greyhound\r\nand the bull-dog; he has less sagacity than most others, and certainly\r\nless courage. He is attached to the stable; he is the friend of the\r\nhorse; they live under the same roof; they share the same bed; and, when\r\nthe horse is summoned to his work, the dog accompanies every step. They\r\nare certainly beautiful dogs, and it is pleasing to see the thousand\r\nexpressions of friendship between them and the horse; but, in their\r\ncontinual excursions through the streets, they are exposed to some\r\ndanger, and particularly to that of being bitten by rabid dogs. It is a\r\nfearful business when this takes place. The coachman probably did not\r\nsee the affray; no suspicion has been excited. The horse rubs his muzzle\r\nto the dog, and the dog licks the face of the horse, and in a great\r\nnumber of cases the disease is communicated from the one to the other.\r\nThe dog in process of time dies, the horse does not long survive, and,\r\nfrequently too, the coachman shares their fate. I have known at least\r\ntwenty horses destroyed in this way.\r\n\r\nA depraved appetite is a frequent attendant on rabies in the dog. He\r\nrefuses his usual food; he frequently turns from it with an evident\r\nexpression of disgust; at other times, he seizes it with greater or less\r\navidity, and then drops it, sometimes from disgust, at other times\r\nbecause he is unable to complete the mastication of it. This palsy of\r\nthe organs of mastication, and dropping of the food, after it has been\r\npartly chewed, is a symptom on which implicit confidence may be placed.\r\n\r\nSome dogs vomit once or twice in the early period of the disease: when\r\nthis happens, they never return to the natural food of the dog, but are\r\neager for everything that is filthy and horrible. The natural appetite\r\ngenerally fails entirely, and to it succeeds a strangely depraved one.\r\nThe dog usually occupies himself with gathering every little bit of\r\nthread, and it is curious to observe with what eagerness and method he\r\nsets to work, and how completely he effects his object. He then attacks\r\nevery kind of dirt and filth, horse-dung, his own dung, and human\r\nexcrement. Some breeds of spaniels are very filthy feeders without its\r\nbeing connected with disease, but the rabid dog eagerly selects the\r\nexcrement of the horse, and his own. Some considerable care, however,\r\nmust be exercised here. At the period of dentition, and likewise at the\r\ncommencement of the sexual affection, the stomach of the dog, and\r\nparticularly that of the bitch, sympathises with, or shares in, the\r\nirritability of the gums, and of the constitution generally, and there\r\nis a considerably perverted appetite. The dog also feels the same\r\npropensity that influences the child, that of taking hard substances\r\ninto the mouth, and seemingly trying to masticate them. Their pressure\r\non the gums facilitates the passage of the new teeth. A young dog will,\r\ntherefore, be observed gathering up hard substances, and, if he should\r\nchance to die, a not inconsiderable collection of them is sometimes\r\nfound in the stomach. They are, however, of a peculiar character; they\r\nconsist of small pieces of bone, slick, and coal.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the stomach of the rabid dog, are often, or generally,\r\nof a most filthy description. Some hair or straw is usually found, but\r\nthe greater part is composed of horse-dung, or of his own dung, and it\r\nmay be received as a certainly, that if he is found deliberately\r\ndevouring it, he is rabid.\r\n\r\nSome very important conclusions may be drawn from the appearance and\r\ncharacter of the urine. The dog, and at particular times when he is more\r\nthan usually salacious, may, and does diligently search the urining\r\nplaces; he may even, at those periods, be seen to lick the spot which\r\nanother has just wetted; but, if a peculiar eagerness accompanies this\r\nstrange employment, if, in the parlour, which is rarely disgraced by\r\nthis evacuation, every corner is perseveringly examined, and licked with\r\nunwearied and unceasing industry, that dog cannot be too carefully\r\nwatched, there is great danger about him; he may, without any other\r\nsymptom, be pronounced to be decidedly rabid. I never knew a single\r\nmistake about this.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the profuse discharge of saliva from the mouth of\r\nthe rabid dog. It is an undoubted fact that, in this disease, all the\r\nglands concerned in the secretion of saliva, become increased in bulk\r\nand vascularity. The sublingual glands wear an evident character of\r\ninflammation; but it never equals the increased discharge that\r\naccompanies epilepsy, or nausea. The frothy spume at the corners of the\r\nmouth, is not for a moment to be compared with that which is evident\r\nenough in both of these affections. It is a symptom of short duration,\r\nand seldom lasts longer than twelve hours. The stories that are told of\r\nthe mad dog covered with froth, are altogether fabulous. The dog\r\nrecovering from, or attacked by a fit, may be seen in this state; but\r\nnot the rabid dog. Fits are often mistaken for rabies, and hence the\r\ndelusion.\r\n\r\nThe increased secretion of saliva soon passes away. It lessens in\r\nquantity; it becomes thicker, viscid, adhesive, and glutinous. It clings\r\nto the corners of the mouth, and probably more annoyingly so to the\r\nmembrane of the fauces. The human being is sadly distressed by it, he\r\nforces it out with the greatest violence, or utters the falsely supposed\r\nbark of a dog, in his attempts to force it from his mouth. This symptom\r\noccurs in the human being, when the disease is fully established, or at\r\na late period of it. The dog furiously attempts to detach it with his\r\npaws.\r\n\r\nIt is an early symptom in the dog, and it can scarcely be mistaken in\r\nhim. When he is fighting with his paws at the corners of his mouth, let\r\nno one suppose that a bone is sticking between the poor fellow's teeth;\r\nnor should any useless and dangerous effort be made to relieve him. If\r\nall this uneasiness arose from a bone in the mouth, the mouth would\r\ncontinue permanently open instead of closing when the animal for a\r\nmoment discontinues his efforts. If after a while he loses his balance\r\nand tumbles over, there can be no longer any mistake. It is the saliva\r\nbecoming more and more glutinous, irritating the fauces and threatening\r\nsuffocation.\r\n\r\nTo this naturally and rapidly succeeds an insatiable thirst. The dog\r\nthat still has full power over the muscles of his jaws continues lo lap.\r\nHe knows not when to cease, while the poor fellow labouring under the\r\ndumb madness, presently to be described, and whose jaw and tongue are\r\nparalysed, plunges his muzzle into the water-dish to his very eyes, in\r\norder that he may get one drop of water into the back part of his mouth\r\nto moisten and to cool his dry and parched fauces. Hence, instead of\r\nthis disease being always characterised by the dread of water in the\r\ndog, it is marked by a thirst often perfectly unquenchable. Twenty years\r\nago, this assertion would have been peremptorily denied. Even at the\r\npresent day we occasionally meet with those who ought to know better,\r\nand who will not believe that the dog which fairly, or perhaps eagerly,\r\ndrinks, can be rabid.\r\n\r\nJanuary 22d, 1815.--A Newfoundland dog belonging to a gentleman in\r\nPiccadilly was supposed to have swallowed a penny-piece on the 20th. On\r\nthe evening of that day he was dull, refused his food, and would not\r\nfollow his master.\r\n\r\n21st. He became restless and pouting, and continually shifting his\r\nposition. He would not eat nor would he drink water, but followed his\r\nmistress into her bed-room, which he had never done before, and eagerly\r\nlapped the urine from her chamber-pot. He was afterwards seen lapping\r\nhis own urine. His restlessness and panting increased, He would neither\r\neat nor drink, and made two or three attempts to vomit.\r\n\r\n22d. He was brought to me this evening. His eyes were wild, the\r\nconjunctiva considerably inflamed, and he panted quickly and violently.\r\nThere was a considerable flow of saliva from the corners of his mouth.\r\nHe was extremely restless and did not remain in one position half a\r\nminute. There was an occasional convulsive nodding motion of the head.\r\nThe eyes were wandering, and evidently following some imaginary object;\r\nbut he was quickly recalled from his delirium by my voice or that of his\r\nmaster. In a few moments, however, he was wandering again. He had\r\npreviously been under my care, and immediately recognised me and offered\r\nme his paw. His bark was changed and had a slight mixture of the howl,\r\nand there was a husky choking noise in the throat.\r\n\r\nI immediately declared that he was rabid, and with some reluctance on\r\nthe part of his master, he was left with me.\r\n\r\n23d, 8 A. M. The breathing was less quick and laborious. The spasm of\r\nthe head was no longer visible. The flow of saliva had stopped and there\r\nwas less delirium. The jaw began to be dependent: the rattling, choking\r\nnoise in his throat louder. He carried straw about in his mouth. He\r\npicked up some pieces of old leather that lay within his reach and\r\ncarefully concealed them under his bed. Two minutes afterwards he would\r\ntake them out again, and look at them, and once more hide them. He\r\nfrequently voided his urine in small quantities, but no longer lapped\r\nit. A little dog was lowered into the den, but he took no notice of it.\r\n\r\n10 P. M. Every symptom of fever returned with increased violence. He\r\npanted very much, and did not remain in the same posture two seconds. He\r\nwas continually running to the end of his chain and attempting to bite.\r\nHe was eagerly and wildly watching some imaginary object. His voice was\r\nhoarser--more of the howl mixing with it. The lips were distorted, and\r\nthe tongue very black. He was evidently getting weaker. After two or\r\nthree attempts to escape, he would sit down for a second, and then rise\r\nand plunge to the end of his chain. He drank frequently, yet but little\r\nat a time, and that without difficulty or spasm.\r\n\r\n12 P. M. The thirst strangely increased. He had drunk or spilled full\r\nthree quarts of water. There was a peculiar eagerness in his manner. He\r\nplunged his nose to the very bottom of his pan, and then snapped at the\r\nbubbles which he raised. No spasm followed the drinking. He took two or\r\nthree pieces from my hand, but immediately dropped them from want of\r\npower to hold them. Yet he was able for a moment suddenly to close his\r\njaws. When not drinking he was barking with a harsh sound, and\r\nfrequently started suddenly, watching, and catching at some imaginary\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n24th, A. M. He was more furious, yet weaker. The thirst was insatiable.\r\nHe was otherwise diligently employed in shattering and tearing\r\neverything within his reach. He died about three o'clock.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say what was the origin of this disease in him. It\r\nis not connected with any degree or variation of temperature, or any\r\nparticular state of the atmosphere. It is certainly more frequent in the\r\nsummer or the beginning of autumn than in the winter or spring, because\r\nit is a highly nervous and febrile disease, and the degree of fever, and\r\nirritability, and ferocity, and consequent mischief are augmented by\r\nincrease of temperature. In the great majority of cases, the inoculation\r\ncan be distinctly proved. In very few can the possibility be denied. The\r\ninjury is inflicted in an instant. There is no contest, and before the\r\ninjured party can prepare to retaliate, the rabid dog is far away.\r\n\r\nIt can easily be believed that when a favourite dog has, but for a\r\nmoment, lagged behind, he may be bitten without the owner's knowledge or\r\nsuspicion. A spaniel belonging to a lady became rabid. The dog was her\r\ncompanion in her grounds at her country residence, and it was rarely out\r\nof her sight except for a few minutes in the morning, when the servant\r\ntook it out. She was not conscious of its having been bitten, and the\r\nservant stoutly denied it. The animal died. A few weeks afterwards the\r\nfootman was taken ill. He was hydrophobous. In one of his intervals of\r\ncomparative quietude he confessed that, one morning, his charge had been\r\nattacked and rolled over by another dog; that there was no appearance of\r\nits having been bitten, but that it had been made sadly dirty, and he\r\nhad washed it before he suffered it again to go into the drawing-room.\r\nThe dog that attacked it must have been rabid, and some of his saliva\r\nmust have remained about the coat of the spaniel, by which the servant\r\nwas fatally inoculated.\r\n\r\nAnother case of this fearful disease must not be passed over. A dog that\r\nhad been docile and attached to his master and mistress, was missing one\r\nmorning, and came home in the evening almost covered with dirt. He slunk\r\nto his basket, and would pay no attention to any one. His owners thought\r\nit rather strange, and I was sent for in the morning. He was lying on\r\nthe lap of his mistress, but was frequently shifting his posture, and\r\nevery now and then he started, as if he heard some strange sound. I\r\nimmediately told them what was the matter, and besought them to place\r\nhim in another and secure room. He had been licking both their hands. I\r\nwas compelled to tell them at once what was the nature of the case, and\r\nbesought them to send at once for their surgeon. They were perfectly\r\nangry at my nonsense, as they called it, and I took my leave, but went\r\nimmediately to their medical man, and told him what was the real state\r\nof the case. He called, as it were accidentally, a little while\r\nafterwards, and I was not far behind him. The surgeon did his duty, and\r\nthey escaped.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1820, I attended on a bitch at Pimlico. She had snapped at the\r\nowner, bitten the man-servant and several dogs, was eagerly watching\r\nimaginary objects, and had the peculiar rabid howl. I offered her water.\r\nShe started back with a strange expression of horror, and fell into\r\nviolent convulsions that lasted about a minute. This was repeated a\r\nlittle while afterwards, and with the same result. She was destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe horrible spasms of the human being at the sight of, or the attempt\r\nto swallow, fluids occur sufficiently often to prove the identity of the\r\ndisease in the biped and the quadruped; but not in one in fifty cases is\r\nthere, in the dog, the slightest reluctance to liquids, or difficulty in\r\nswallowing them.\r\n\r\nIn almost every case in which the dog utters any sound during the\r\ndisease, there is a manifest change of voice. In the dog labouring under\r\nferocious madness, it is perfectly characteristic. There is no other\r\nsound that it resembles. The animal is generally standing, or\r\noccasionally sitting, when the singular sound is heard. The muzzle is\r\nalways elevated. The commencement is that of a perfect bark, ending\r\nabruptly and very singularly, in a howl, a fifth, sixth, or eighth\r\nhigher than at the commencement. Dogs are often enough heard howling,\r\nbut in this case it is the perfect bark, and the perfect howl rapidly\r\nsucceeding to the bark.\r\n\r\nEvery sound uttered by the rabid dog is more or less changed. The\r\nhuntsman, who knows the voice of every dog in his pack, occasionally\r\nhears a strange challenge. He immediately finds out that dog, and puts\r\nhim, as quickly as possible, under confinement. Two or three days may\r\npass over, and there is not another suspicious circumstance about the\r\nanimal; still he keeps him under quarantine, for long experience has\r\ntaught him to listen to that warning. At length the disease is manifest\r\nin its most fearful form.\r\n\r\nThere is another partial change of voice, to which the ear of the\r\npractitioner will, by degrees, become habituated, and which will\r\nindicate a change in the state of the animal quite as dangerous as the\r\ndismal howl; I mean when there is a hoarse inward bark, with a slight\r\nbut characteristic elevation of the tone. In other cases, after two or\r\nthree distinct barks, will come the peculiar one mingled with the howl.\r\nBoth of them will terminate fatally, and in both of them the rabid howl\r\ncannot possibly be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThere is a singular brightness in the eye of the rabid dog, but it does\r\nnot last more than two or three days. It then becomes dull and wasted; a\r\ncloudiness steals over the conjunctiva, which changes to a yellow tinge,\r\nand then to a dark green, indicative of ulceration deeply seated within\r\nthe eye. In eight and forty hours from the first clouding of the eye, it\r\nbecomes one disorganised mass.\r\n\r\nThere is in the rabid dog a strange embarrassment of general\r\nsensibility--a seemingly total loss of feeling.\r\n\r\nAbsence of pain in the bitten part is an almost invariable accompaniment\r\nof rabies. I have known a dog set to work, and gnaw and tear the flesh\r\ncompletely away from his legs and feet. At other times the penis is\r\nperfectly demolished from the very base. Ellis in his \"Shepherd's Sure\r\nGuide,\" asserts, that, however severely a mad dog is beaten, a cry is\r\nnever forced from him. I am certain of the truth of this, for I have\r\nagain and again failed in extracting that cry. Ellis tells that at the\r\nkennel at Goddesden, some of the grooms heated a poker red hot, and\r\nholding it near the mad hound's mouth, he most greedily seized it, and\r\nkept it until the mouth was most dreadfully burned.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of cases of furious madness, and in almost every\r\ncase of dumb madness, there is evident affection of the lumbar portion\r\nof the spinal cord. There is a staggering gait, not indicative of\r\ngeneral weakness, but referable to the hind quarters alone, and\r\nindicating an affection of the lumbar motor nerve. In a few cases it\r\napproaches more to a general paralytic affection.\r\n\r\nIn the very earliest period of rabies, the person accustomed to dogs\r\nwill detect the existence of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe animal follows the flight, as has been already stated, of various\r\nimaginary objects. I have often watched the changing countenance of the\r\nrabid dog when he has been lost to every surrounding object. I have seen\r\nthe brightening countenance and the wagging tail as some pleasing vision\r\nhas passed before him; but, oftener has the countenance indicated the\r\nmingled dislike and fear with which the intruder was regarded. As soon\r\nas the phantom came within the proper distance he darted on it with true\r\nrabid violence.\r\n\r\nA spaniel, seemingly at play, snapped, in the morning, at the feet of\r\nseveral persons. In the evening he bit his master, his master's friend,\r\nand another dog. The old habits of obedience and affection then\r\nreturned. His master, most strangely, did not suspect the truth, and\r\nbrought the animal to me to be examined. The animal was, as I had often\r\nseen him, perfectly docile and eager to be caressed. At my suggestion,\r\nor rather entreaty, he was left with me. On the following morning the\r\ndisease was plain enough, and on the following day he died. A\r\npost-mortem examination took place, and proved that he was unequivocally\r\nrabid.\r\n\r\nA lady would nurse her dog, after I had declared it to be rabid, and\r\nwhen he was dangerous to every one but herself, and even to her from the\r\nsaliva which he plentifully scattered about. At length he darted at\r\nevery one that entered the room, until a footman keeping the animal at\r\nbay with the poker, the husband of the lady dragged her from the room.\r\nThe noise that the dog made was then terrific, and he almost gnawed his\r\nway through the door. At midnight his violence nearly ceased, and the\r\ndoor was partially opened. He was staggering and falling about, with\r\nevery limb violently agitated. At the entreaty of the lady, a servant\r\nventured in to make a kind of bed for him. The dog suddenly darted at\r\nhim, and dropped and died.\r\n\r\nA terrier, ten years old, had been ill, and refused all food for three\r\ndays. On the fourth day he bit a cat of which he had been unusually\r\nfond, and he likewise bit three dogs. I was requested to see him. I\r\nfound him loose in the kitchen, and at first refused to go in, but,\r\nafter observing him for a minute or two, I thought that I might venture.\r\nHe had a peculiarly wild and eager look, and turned sharply round at the\r\nleast noise. He often watched the flight of some imaginary object, and\r\npursued with the utmost fury every fly that he saw. He searchingly\r\nsniffed about the room, and examined my legs with an eagerness that made\r\nme absolutely tremble. His quarrel with the cat had been made up, and\r\nwhen he was not otherwise employed he was eagerly licking her and her\r\nkittens. In the excess or derangement of his fondness, he fairly rolled\r\nthem from one end of the kitchen to another. With difficulty I induced\r\nhis master to permit me to destroy him.\r\n\r\nIt is not every dog, that in the most aggravated state of the disease\r\nshows a disposition to bite. The finest Newfoundland dog that I ever saw\r\nbecame rabid. He had been bitten by a cur, and was supposed to have been\r\nthoroughly examined in the country. No wound, however, was found: the\r\ncircumstance was almost forgotten, and he came up to the metropolis with\r\nhis master. He became dull, disinclined to play, and refused all food.\r\nHe was continually watching imaginary objects, but he did not snap at\r\nthem. There was no howl, nor any disposition to bite. He offered himself\r\nto be caressed, and he was not satisfied except he was shaken by the\r\npaw. On the second day I saw him. He watched every passing object with\r\npeculiar anxiety, and followed with deep attention the motions of a\r\nhorse, his old acquaintance; but he made no effort to escape, nor\r\nevinced any disposition to do mischief. I went to him, and patted and\r\ncoaxed him, and he told me as plainly as looks and actions, and a\r\nsomewhat deepened whine could express it, how much he was gratified. I\r\nsaw him on the third day. He was evidently dying. He could not crawl\r\neven to the door of his temporary kennel; but he pushed forward his paw\r\na little way, and, as I shook it, I felt the tetanic muscular action\r\nwhich accompanies the departure of life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there are rabid dogs whose ferocity knows no bounds.\r\nIf they are threatened with a stick, they fly at, and seize it, and\r\nfuriously shake it. They are incessantly employed in darting to the end\r\nof their chain, and attempting to crush it with their teeth, and tearing\r\nto pieces their kennel, or the wood work that is within their reach.\r\nThey are regardless of pain. The canine teeth, the incisor teeth are\r\ntorn away; yet, unwearied and insensible to suffering, they continue\r\ntheir efforts to escape. A dog was chained near a kitchen fire. He was\r\nincessant in his endeavours to escape, and, when he found that he could\r\nnot effect it, he seized, in his impotent rage, the burning coals as\r\nthey fell, and crushed them with his teeth.\r\n\r\nIf by chance a dog in this state effects his escape, he wanders over the\r\ncountry bent on destruction. He attacks both the quadruped and the\r\nbiped. He seeks the village street, or the more crowded one of the town,\r\nand he suffers no dog to escape him. The horse is his frequent prey, and\r\nthe human being is not always safe from his attack. A rabid dog running\r\ndown Park-lane, in 1825, bit no fewer than five horses, and fully as\r\nmany dogs. He was seen to steal treacherously upon some of his victims,\r\nand inflict the fatal wound. Sometimes he seeks the more distant\r\npasturage. He gets among the sheep, and more than forty have been\r\nfatally inoculated in one night. A rabid dog attacked a herd of cows,\r\nand five-and-twenty of them fell victims. In July, 1813, a mad dog broke\r\ninto the menagerie of the Duchess of York, at Oatlands, and although the\r\npalisades that divided the different compartments of the menagerie were\r\nfull six feet in height, and difficult, or apparently almost impossible\r\nto climb, he was found asleep in one of them, and it was clearly\r\nascertained that he had bitten at least ten of the dogs.\r\n\r\nAt length the rabid dog becomes completely exhausted, and slowly reels\r\nalong the road with his tail depressed, seemingly half unconscious of\r\nsurrounding objects. His open mouth, and protruding and blackened\r\ntongue, and rolling gait sufficiently characterise him. He creeps into\r\nsome sheltered place and then he sleeps twelve hours or more. It is\r\ndangerous to disturb his slumbers, for his desire to do mischief\r\nimmediately returns, and the slightest touch, or attempt to caress him,\r\nis repaid by a fatal wound. This should be a caution never to meddle\r\nwith a sleeping dog in a way-side house, and, indeed, never to disturb\r\nhim anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn an early period of the disease in some dogs, and in others when the\r\nstrength of the animal is nearly worn away, a peculiar paralysis of the\r\nmuscles of the tongue and jaws is seen. The mouth is partially open, and\r\nthe tongue protruding. In some cases the dog is able to close his mouth\r\nby a sudden and violent effort, and is as ferocious and as dangerous as\r\none the muscles of whose face are unaffected. At other times the palsy\r\nis complete, and the animal is unable to close his mouth or retract his\r\ntongue. These latter cases, however, are rare.\r\n\r\nA dog must not be immediately condemned because he has this open mouth\r\nand fixed jaw. Bones constitute a frequent and a considerable portion of\r\nthe food of dogs. In the eagerness with which these bones are crushed,\r\nspicula or large pieces of them become wedged between the molar teeth,\r\nand form an inseparable obstacle to the closing of the teeth. The tongue\r\npartially protrudes. There is a constant discharge of saliva from the\r\nmouth, far greater than when the true paralysis exists. The dog is\r\ncontinually fighting at the corners of his mouth, and the countenance is\r\nexpressive of intense anxiety, although not of the same irritable\r\ncharacter as in rabies.\r\n\r\nI was once requested to meet a medical gentleman in consultation\r\nrespecting a supposed case of rabies. There was protrusion and\r\ndiscoloration of the tongue, and fighting at the corners of the mouth,\r\nand intense anxiety of countenance. He had been in this state for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours. This was a case in which I should possibly have\r\nbeen deceived had it been the first dog that I had seen with dumb\r\nmadness. After having tested a little the ferocity or manageableness of\r\nthe animal, I passed my hand along the outside of the jaws, and felt a\r\nbone wedged between two of the grinders. The forceps soon set all right\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nIt is time to inquire more strictly into the post-mortem appearances of\r\nrabies in the dog.\r\n\r\nIn dumb madness the unfailing accompaniment is, to a greater or less\r\ndegree, paralysis of the muscles of the lower jaw, and the tongue is\r\ndiscoloured and swollen, and hanging from the mouth; more blood than\r\nusual also is deposited in the anterior and inferior portion of it. Its\r\ncolour varies from a dark red to a dingy purple, or almost black. In\r\nferocious madness it is usually torn and bruised, or it is discoloured\r\nby the dirt and filth with which it has been brought into contact, and,\r\nnot unfrequently, its anterior portion is coated with some disgusting\r\nmatter. The papillae, or small projections on the back of the tongue,\r\nare elongated and widened, and their mucous covering evidently reddened.\r\nThe orifices of the glands of the tongue are frequently enlarged,\r\nparticularly as they run their course along the froenum of the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe fauces, situated at the posterior part of the mouth, generally\r\nexhibit traces of inflammation. They appear in the majority of cases of\r\nferocious madness, and they are never deficient after dumb madness. They\r\nare usually most intense either towards the palatine arch or the larynx.\r\nSometimes an inflammatory character is diffused through its whole\r\nextent, but occasionally it is more or less intense towards one or both\r\nof the terminations of the fauces, while the intermediate portion\r\nretains nearly its healthy hue.\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance of not unfrequent occurrence, which will at\r\nonce decide the case--the presence of indigestible matter, probably\r\nsmall in quantity, in the back part of the mouth. This speaks volumes as\r\nto the depraved appetite of the patient, and the loss of power in the\r\nmuscles of the pharynx.\r\n\r\nLittle will depend on the tonsils of the throat. They occasionally\r\nenlarge to more than double their usual size; but this is more in quiet\r\nthan in ferocious madness. The insatiable thirst of the rabid dog is\r\nperhaps connected with this condition of them.\r\n\r\nThe epiglottis should be very carefully observed. It is more or less\r\ninjected in every case of rabies. Numerous vessels increase in size and\r\nmultiply round its edge, and there is considerable injection and\r\nthickening.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the edges of the glottis, and particularly of the\r\nmembrane which covers its margin, is often seen, and accounts for the\r\nharsh guttural breathing which frequently accompanies dumb madness. The\r\ninflammatory blush of the larynx, though often existing in a very slight\r\ndegree, deserves considerable attention.\r\n\r\nThe appearances in the trachea are very uncertain. There is occasionally\r\nthe greatest intensity of inflammation through the whole of it; at other\r\ntimes there is not the slightest appearance of it. There is the same\r\nuncertainty with regard to the bronchial tubes and the lungs; but there\r\nis no characteristic symptom or lesion in the lungs.\r\n\r\nGreat stress has been laid on the appearance of the heart; but,\r\ngenerally speaking, in nine cases out of ten, the heart of the rabid dog\r\nwill exhibit no other symptoms of disease than an increased yet variable\r\ndeepness of colour in the lining membrane of the ventricles. No\r\ndependence can be placed on any of the appearances of the oesophagus;\r\nand, when they are at the worst, the inflammation occupies only a\r\nportion of that tube.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the interior of the stomach, if the dog has been dead\r\nonly a few hours the true inflammatory blush will remain. If\r\nfour-and-twenty hours have elapsed, the bright red colour will have\r\nchanged to a darker red, or a violet or a brownish hue. In a few hours\r\nafter this, a process of corrosion will generally commence, and the\r\nmucous membrane will be softened and rendered thinner, and, to a certain\r\nextent, eaten through. The examiner, however, must not attribute that to\r\ndisease which is the natural process of the cession of life.\r\n\r\nMuch attention should be paid to the appearance of the stomach and its\r\ncontents. If it contains a strange mingled mass of hair, and hay, and\r\nstraw, and horse-dung, and earth, or portions of the bed on which the\r\ndog had lain, we should seldom err if we affirmed that he died rabid;\r\nfor it is only under the influence of the depraved appetite of rabies\r\nthat such substances are devoured. It is not the presence of every kind\r\nof extraneous substance that will be satisfactory: pieces of coal, or\r\nwood, or even the filthiest matter, will not justify us in pronouncing\r\nthe animal to be rabid; it is that peculiarly mingled mass of straw, and\r\nhair, and filth of various kinds, that must indicate the existence of\r\nrabies.\r\n\r\nWhen there are no solid indigesta, but a fluid composed principally of\r\nvitiated bile or extravasated blood, there will be a strong indication\r\nof the presence of rabies. When, also, there are in the duodenum and\r\njejunum small portions of indigesta, the detection of the least quantity\r\nwill be decisive. The remainder has been ejected by vomit; and inquiry\r\nshould be made of the nature of the matter that has been discharged.\r\n\r\nThe inflammation of rabies is of a peculiar character in the stomach. It\r\nis generally confined to the summits of the folds of the stomach, or it\r\nis most intense there. On the summits of the rugae there are effusions\r\nof bloody matter, or spots of ecchymosis, presenting an appearance\r\nalmost like crushed black currants. There may be only a few of them; but\r\nthey are indications of the evil that has been effected.\r\n\r\nFrom appearances that present themselves in the intestines, the bladder,\r\nthe blood-vessels, or the brain, no conclusion can be drawn; they are\r\nsimply indications of inflammation.\r\n\r\nWe now rapidly, and for a little while, retrace our steps. What is the\r\ncause of this fatal disease, that has so long occupied our attention? It\r\nis the saliva of a rabid animal received into a wound, or on an abraded\r\nsurface. In horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and the human being, it is\r\ncaused by inoculation alone; but, according to some persons, it is\r\nproduced spontaneously in other animals.\r\n\r\nI will suppose that a wound by a rabid dog is inflicted. The virus is\r\ndeposited on or near its surface, and there it remains for a certain\r\nindefinite period of time. The wound generally heals up kindly; in fact,\r\nit differs in no respect from a similar wound inflicted by the teeth of\r\nan animal in perfect health. Weeks and months, in some cases, pass on,\r\nand there is nothing to indicate danger, until a degree of itching in\r\nthe cicatrix of the wound is felt. From its long-continued presence as a\r\nforeign body, it may have rendered the tissue, or nervous fibre\r\nconnected with it, irritable and susceptible of impression, or it may\r\nhave attracted and assimilated to itself certain elements, and rabies is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe virus does not appear to have the same effect on every animal. Of\r\nfour dogs bitten by, or inoculated from, one that is rabid, three,\r\nperhaps, would display every symptom of the disease. Of four human\r\nbeings, not more than one would become rabid. John Hunter used to say\r\nnot more than one in twenty; but that is probably erroneous. Cattle\r\nappear to have a greater chance of escape, and sheep a still greater\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nThe time of incubation is different in different animals. With regard to\r\nthe human being, there are various strange and contradictory stories.\r\nSome have asserted that it has appeared on the very day on which the\r\nbite was inflicted, or within two or three days of that time. Dr.\r\nBardsley, on the other hand, relates a case in which twelve years\r\nelapsed between the bite and the disease. If the virus may lurk so long\r\nas this in the constitution, it is a most lamentable affair. According\r\nto one account, more than thirty years intervened. The usual time\r\nextends from three weeks to six or seven months.\r\n\r\nIn the dog I have never seen a case in which plain and palpable rabies\r\noccurred in less than fourteen days after the bite. The average time I\r\nshould calculate at five or six weeks. In three months I should consider\r\nthe animal as tolerably safe. I am, however, relating my own experience,\r\nand have known but two instances in which the period much exceeded three\r\nmonths. In one of these five months elapsed, and the other did not\r\nbecome affected until after the expiration of the seventh month.\r\n\r\nThe quality and the quantity of the virus may have something to do with\r\nthis, and so may the predisposition in the bitten animal to be affected\r\nby the poison. If it is connected with oestrum, the bitch will probably\r\nbecome a disgusting, as well as dangerous animal; if with parturition,\r\nthere is a strange perversion of maternal affection--she is incessantly\r\nand violently licking her young, continually shifting them from place to\r\nplace; and, in less than four-and-twenty hours, they will be destroyed\r\nby the reckless manner in which they are treated. In both cases the\r\ndevelopment of the disease seems to wait on the completion of her time\r\nof pregnancy. It appears in the space of two months after the bite, if\r\nher parturition is near at hand, or it is delayed for double that time,\r\nif the period of labour is so far distant.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the disease is different in different animals. In man it\r\nhas run its course in twenty-four hours, and rarely exceeds seventy-two.\r\nIn the horse from three to four days; in the sheep and ox from five to\r\nseven; and in the dog from four to six.\r\n\r\nOf the real nature of the rabid virus, we know but little. It has never\r\nbeen analysed, and it would be a difficult process to analyse it. It is\r\nnot diffused by the air, nor communicated by the breath, nor even by\r\nactual contact, if the skin is sound. It must be received into a wound.\r\nIt must come in contact with some tissue or nervous fibre, and lie\r\ndormant there for a considerable, but uncertain period. The absorbents\r\nremove everything around; whatever else is useless, or would he\r\ninjurious, is taken away, but this strange substance is unchanged. It\r\ndoes not enter into the circulation, for there it would undergo some\r\nmodification and change, or would be rejected. It lies for a time\r\nabsolutely dormant, and far longer than any other known poison; but, at\r\nlength, the tissue on which it has lain begins to render it somewhat\r\nsensible, and assimilates to itself certain elements. The cicatrix\r\nbegins to be painful, and inflammation spreads around. The absorbents\r\nare called into more powerful action; they begin to attack the virus\r\nitself, and a portion of it is taken up, and carried into the\r\ncirculation, and acquires the property of assimilating other secretions\r\nto its own nature, or it is determined to one of the secretions only; it\r\nalters the character of that secretion, envenoms it, and gives it the\r\npower of propagating the disease.\r\n\r\nSomething like this is the history of many animal poisons. In variola\r\nand the vaccine disease the poison is determined to the skin, in\r\nglanders to the Schneiderian membrane, and in farcy to the superficial\r\nabsorbents. Each in its turn becomes the depot of the poison. So it is\r\nwith the salivary glands of the rabid animal; in them it is formed, or\r\nto them it is determined, and from them, and them alone, it is\r\ncommunicated to other animals.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dick, in his valuable Manual of Veterinary Science, states\r\nsome peculiar views, and those highly interesting, respecting the\r\ndisease of rabies. He holds it to be essentially an inflammatory\r\naffection, attacking peculiarly the mucous membrane of the nose, and\r\nextending thence through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bones to\r\nthe interior part of the brain, and so giving rise to a derangement of\r\nthe nervous system as a necessary consequence. This train of symptoms\r\nconstitutes mainly, if not wholly, the essence of an occasional epidemic\r\nnot unlike some forms of influenza or epizootic disease, and the bite of\r\na rabid animal is not always, to an animal so bitten, the exciting cause\r\nof the disease, but merely an accidental concomitant in the prevailing\r\ndisorder. Also the disease hydrophobia, produced in man, is not always\r\nthe result of any poison introduced into his system, but merely the\r\nmelancholy, and often fatal result of panic fear, and of the disordered\r\nslate of the imagination. Those who are acquainted with the effects of\r\nsympathy, and imitation, and panic, in the production of nervous\r\ndisorders, will readily apprehend the meaning of the Professor.\r\n\r\nSome of these diseases speedily run their course and exhaust themselves.\r\nCowpox and farcy, in many instances, have this character. Perhaps, to a\r\ncertain degree, this may be affirmed of all of them. I have seen cases,\r\nwhich I could not mistake, in which the symptoms of rabies were one\r\nafter another developed. The dog was plainly and undeniably rabid, and I\r\nhad given him up as lost; but, after a certain period, the symptoms\r\nbegan to be less distinct; they gradually disappeared, and the animal\r\nreturned to perfect health. This may have formed one ground of belief in\r\nthe power of certain medicines, and most assuredly it gives\r\nencouragement to perseverance in the use of remedial measures.\r\n\r\nIt has then been proved, and I hope demonstratively, that rabies is\r\npropagated by inoculation. It has also been established that although\r\nevery animal labouring under this disease is capable of communicating\r\nit, yet, with very few exceptions, it can be traced to the bite of the\r\ndog. It has still further been shown that the malady, generally appears\r\nat some period between the third and seventh month from the time of\r\ninoculation. At the expiration of the eighth month, the animal may be\r\nconsidered to be safe; for there is only one acknowledged case on\r\nrecord, in which the disease appeared in the dog after the seventh month\r\nfrom the bite had passed.\r\n\r\nThen it would appear that if a species of quarantine could be\r\nestablished, and every dog confined separately for eight months, the\r\ndisease would be annihilated in our country, or could only reappear in\r\nconsequence of the importation of some infected animal. Such a course of\r\nproceeding, however, could never be enforced either in the sporting\r\nworld or among the peasantry. Other measures, however, might be resorted\r\nto in order to lessen the devastations of this malady; and that which\r\nfirst presents itself to the mind as a powerful cause of rabies is the\r\nnumber of useless and dangerous dogs that are kept in the country for\r\nthe most nefarious and, in the neighbourhood of considerable towns, the\r\nmost brutal purposes; without the slightest hesitation, I will affirm\r\nthat rabies is propagated, nineteen times out of twenty, by the cur and\r\nthe lurcher in the country, and the fighting-dog in towns.\r\n\r\nA tax should be laid on every useless dog, and doubly or trebly heavier\r\nthan on the sporting-dog. No dog except the shepherd's should be exempt\r\nfrom this tax, unless, perhaps, it is the truck-dog, and his owner\r\nshould be compelled to take out a license; to have his name in large\r\nletters on his cart; and he should be heavily fined if the animal is\r\nfound loose in the streets, or if he is used for fighting.\r\n\r\nThe disease is rarely propagated by petted and house-dogs They are\r\nlittle exposed to the danger of inoculation; yet, we pity, or almost\r\ndetest, the folly of those by whom their favourites are indulged, and\r\nspoiled even more than their children.\r\n\r\nWe will now suppose that a person has had the misfortune to be bitten by\r\na rabid dog: what course is he to pursue? What preventive means are to\r\nbe adopted? Some persons, and of no mean standing in the medical world,\r\nhave recommended a ligature. The reply would be, that this ligature must\r\nbe worn during a very inconvenient and dangerous period of time. The\r\nvirus lies in the wound inert during many successive weeks and months.\r\n\r\nDr. Haygarth first suggested that a long-continued stream of warm water\r\nshould be poured upon the wound from the mouth of a kettle. He says that\r\nthe poison exists in a fluid form, and therefore we should suppose that\r\nwater would be its natural solvent. Dr. Massey adds to this, that if the\r\nwound is small, it should be dilated, in order that the stream may\r\ndescend on the part on which the poison is deposited. We are far,\r\nhowever, from being certain that this falling of water on the part, may\r\nnot by possibility force a portion of the virus farther into the\r\ntexture, or cause it to be entangled with other parts of the wound. [2]\r\n\r\nThere is a similar or stronger objection to the cupping-glass of Dr.\r\nBarry. The virus, forced from the texture with which it lies in contact\r\nby the rush of blood from the substance beneath, is too likely to\r\ninoculate, or become entangled with, other parts of the wound.\r\n\r\nThere is great objection to suction of the wound; for, in addition to\r\nthis possible entanglement, the lips, or the mouth, may have been\r\nabraded, and thus the danger considerably aggravated. There also remains\r\nthe undecided question as to the absorption of the virus through the\r\nmedium of a mucous surface.\r\n\r\nExcision of the part is the mode of prevention usually adopted by the\r\nhuman surgeon, and to a certain extent it is a judicious practice. If\r\nthe virus is not received into the circulation, but lies dormant in the\r\nwound for a considerable time, the disease cannot supervene if the\r\ninoculated part is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis operation, however, demands greater skill and tact than is\r\ngenerally supposed. It requires a determination fully to accomplish the\r\ndesired object; for every portion of the wound with which the tooth\r\ncould possibly have come into contact, must be removed. This is often\r\nexceedingly difficult to accomplish, on account of the situation and\r\ndirection of the wound. The knife must not enter the wound, or it will\r\nbe likely to be itself empoisoned, and then the mischief and the danger\r\nwill be increased instead of removed. Dr. Massey was convinced of the\r\nimpropriety of this when he advised that,\r\n\r\n  \"should the knife by chance enter the wound that had been made by the\r\n  dog's tooth, the operation should be recommenced with a clean knife,\r\n  otherwise the sound parts will become inoculated.\"\r\n\r\nIf the incision is made freely and properly round the wound, and does\r\nnot penetrate into it, yet the blood will follow the knife, and a\r\nportion of it will enter into the wound caused by the dog, and will come\r\nin contact with the virus, and will probably be contaminated, and will\r\nthen overflow the original wound, and will be received into the new\r\nincision, and will carry with it the seeds of disease and death:\r\ntherefore it is, that scarcely a year passes without some lamentable\r\ninstances of the failure of incisions. It has occurred in the practice\r\nof the most eminent surgeons, and seems scarcely or not all to impeach\r\nthe skill of the operator.\r\n\r\nAware of this, there are very few human practitioners who do not use the\r\ncaustic after the knife. Every portion of the new wound is submitted to\r\nits influence. They do not consider the patient to be safe without this\r\nsecond operation. But has the question never occurred to them, that if\r\nthe caustic is necessary to give security to the operation by incision,\r\nthe knife might have been spared, and the caustic alone used?\r\n\r\nThe veterinary surgeon, when operating on the horse, or cattle, or the\r\ndog, frequently has recourse to the actual cautery. I could, perhaps,\r\nexcuse this practice, although I would not adopt it, in superficial\r\nwounds; but I do not know the instrument that could be safely used in\r\ndeeper ones. If it were sufficiently small to adapt itself to the\r\ntortuous course of little wounds, it would be cooled and inert before it\r\ncould have destroyed the lower portions of them. If it were of\r\nsufficient substance long to retain the heat, it would make a large and\r\nfearful chasm, and probably interfere with the future usefulness of the\r\nanimal. The result of the cases in which the cautery has been used\r\nproves that in too many instances it is an inefficient protection. The\r\nrabid dog in Park Lane has already been mentioned. He bit several horses\r\nbefore he could be destroyed. Caustic was applied to one of them, and\r\nthe hot iron to the others. The first was saved, almost all the others\r\nwere lost. A similar case occurred last spring; the caustic was an\r\nefficacious preventive; the cautery was perfectly useless. What caustic\r\nthen should be applied? Certainly not that to which the surgeon usually\r\nhas recourse--a liquid one. Certainly not one that speedily deliquesces;\r\nfor they are both unmanageable, and, what is a more important\r\nconsideration, they may hold in solution, and not decompose the poison,\r\nand thus inoculate the whole of the wound. The application which\r\npromises to be successful, is that of the 'lunar caustic'. It is\r\nperfectly manageable, and, being sharpened to a point, may be applied\r\nwith certainty to every recess and sinuosity of the wound.\r\n\r\nPotash and nitric acid form a caustic which will destroy the substances\r\nwith which they come in contact, but the combination of this caustic and\r\nthe animal fibre will be a soft or semi-fluid mass. In this the virus is\r\nsuspended, and with this it lies or may be precipitated upon the living\r\nfibre beneath. Then there is danger of re-inoculation; and it would seem\r\nthat this fatal process is often accomplished. The eschar formed by the\r\nlunar caustic is dry, hard, and insoluble. If the whole of the wound has\r\nbeen fairly exposed to its action, an insoluble compound of animal fibre\r\nand the metallic salt is produced, in which the virus is wrapped up, and\r\nfrom which it cannot be separated. In a short time the dead matter\r\nsloughs away, and the virus is thrown off with it.\r\n\r\nPrevious to applying the caustic it will sometimes be necessary to\r\nenlarge the wound, in order that every part may be fairly got at; and\r\nthe eschar having sloughed off, it will always be prudent to apply the\r\ncaustic a second time, but more slightly, in order to destroy any part\r\nthat may not have received the full influence of the first operation, or\r\nthat, by possibility, might have been inoculated during the operation.\r\n\r\nMr. Smerdon, in the Medical and Physical Journal, March 1820, thus\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n  \"All the morbid poisons that require to lie dormant a certain time\r\n  before their effects are manifested, pass into the system through the\r\n  medium of the absorbents,\" (we somewhat differ from Mr. Smerdon here,\r\n  but his reasoning is equally applicable to the nervous system,) \"and\r\n  if the absorbents are excited, their action is increased. I am\r\n  satisfied that even in a venereal sore the application of a caustic,\r\n  instead of destroying the disease, causes its rapid extension. Then,\"\r\n  asks he, \"if the virus on a small venereal sore is rendered more\r\n  active by the caustic, is it not highly probable that the same law\r\n  holds good with respect to the poison of rabies?\"\r\n\r\nThe sooner the caustic is applied the better; but I should not hesitate\r\nto have recourse to it even after the constitution has become affected.\r\nIt is related in the Medico-Chirurgical Annals of Altenburg (Sept.\r\n1821), that two men were bitten by a rabid dog. One became hydrophobous\r\nand died; the other had evident symptoms of hydrophobia a few days\r\nafterwards. A surgeon excised the bitten part, and the disease\r\ndisappeared. After a period of six days the symptoms returned. The wound\r\nwas examined; considerable fungus was found sprouting from its bottom.\r\nThis was extirpated. The hydrophobia symptoms were again removed, and\r\nthe man did well. This is a most instructive case.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal Pratique de Médecine Vétérinaire, M. Damalix gives an\r\ninteresting account of the effect of a bite of a rabid dog on a horse.\r\nOn the 8th of July, 1828, a fowl-merchant, proceeding to the market of\r\nColmar, was attacked by a dog, who, after some fruitless efforts to get\r\ninto the cart, bit the horse on the left side of the face, and fled\r\nprecipitately. A veterinary surgeon was sent for, who applied the\r\ncautery to the horse, gave him some populeum ointment, and bled him.\r\nEverything appeared to go on well, and on the 16th the wounds were\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th a great alteration took place. The horse was careless and\r\nslow; he sometimes refused to go at all, and would not attend in the\r\nleast to the whip, which had never occurred before. In the evening the\r\nwounds opened spontaneously, an ichorous and infectious pus run from\r\nthem; there was salivation and utter loss of appetite: strange fancies\r\nseemed to possess him; he showed a desire to bite his master. The\r\nveterinary surgeon might approach him with safety; but the moment his\r\nowner or the children appeared, he darted at them, and would have torn\r\nthem in pieces. The disease now took on the appearance of acute\r\nglanders; livid and fungous wounds broke out; the stable was saturated\r\nwith an infectious smell, the horse refused his food, or was unable to\r\neat. The mayor at last interfered, and the animal was destroyed. In the\r\nTreatises on The Horse, Cattle, and Sheep, in former volumes, accounts\r\nare fully given of this dreadful malady in these animals. It may not be\r\nuninteresting to give a hasty sketch of it in some of the inferior\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n'Rabies in the Rabbit.'--I very much regret that I never instituted a\r\ncourse of experiments on the production and treatment of rabies in this\r\nanimal. It would have been attended with little expense or danger, and\r\nsome important discoveries might have been made. Mr. Earle, in a case in\r\nwhich he was much interested, inoculated two rabbits with the saliva of\r\na dog that had died rabid. They were punctured at the root of the ears.\r\nOne of the rabbits speedily became inflamed about the ears, and the ears\r\nwere paralysed in both rabbits. The head swelled very much, and\r\nextensive inflammation took place around the part where the virus was\r\ninserted. One of them died without exhibiting any of the usual symptoms\r\nof the disease; the other, after a long convalescence, survived, and\r\neventually recovered the use of his ears. Mr. Earle very properly\r\ndoubted whether this was a case of rabies.\r\n\r\nDr. Capello describes, but in not so satisfactory a manner as could be\r\nwished, a case of supposed rabies in one of these animals. A rabbit and\r\na dog lived together in a family. They were strange associates; but such\r\nfriendships are not unfrequent among animals. The dog became rabid, and\r\ndied. A man bitten by that dog became hydrophobous, and died. No one\r\ndreamed of the rabbit being in danger, and he ran about the house as\r\nusual; but, one day, he found his way to the chamber of the mistress of\r\nthe house, with a great deal of viscid saliva running from his mouth,\r\nfuriously attacked her, and left the marks of his violence on her leg.\r\nHe then ran into a neighbouring stable, and bit the hind-legs of a horse\r\nseveral times. Finally, he retreated to a corner of the stable, and was\r\nthere found dead. Neither the lady nor the horse eventually suffered.\r\n\r\n'Rabies in the Guinea-pig'.--A man suspected of being hydrophobous was\r\ntaken to the Middlesex Hospital. He was examined before several of the\r\nmedical students; one of whom, in order to make more sure of the affair,\r\ninoculated a guinea-pig with the saliva taken from the man's mouth. The\r\nguinea-pig had been usually very playful, and fond of being noticed;\r\nbut, on the eleventh day after this inoculation, he began to be dull and\r\nsullen, retiring into his house, and hiding himself as much as he could\r\nin a corner. On the following day he became out of temper, and even\r\nferocious in his way; he bit at everything that was presented to him,\r\ngnawed his cage, and made the most determined efforts to escape. Once or\r\ntwice his violence induced convulsions of his whole frame; and they\r\nmight be produced at pleasure by dashing a little water at him. In the\r\ncourse of the night following he died.\r\n\r\n'Rabies in the Cat'.--Fortunately for us, this does not often occur; for\r\na mad cat is a truly ferocious animal. I have seen two cases, one of\r\nthem to my cost; yet, I am unable to give any satisfactory account of\r\nthe progress of the disease. The first stage seems to be one of\r\nsullenness, and which would probably last to death; but from that\r\nsullenness it is dangerous to rouse the animal. It probably would not,\r\nexcept in the paroxysm of rage, attack any one; but during that paroxysm\r\nit knows no fear, nor has its ferocity any bounds.\r\n\r\nA cat, that had been the inhabitant of a nursery, and the playmate of\r\nthe children, had all at once become sullen and ill-tempered. It had\r\ntaken refuge in an upper room, and could not be coaxed from the corner\r\nin which it had crouched. It was nearly dark when I went. I saw the\r\nhorrible glare of her eyes, but I could not see so much of her as I\r\nwished, and I said that I would call again in the morning.\r\n\r\nI found the patient, on the following day, precisely in the same\r\nsituation and the same attitude, crouched up in a corner, and ready to\r\nspring. I was very much interested in the case; and as I wanted to study\r\nthe countenance of this demon, for she looked like one, I was foolishly,\r\ninexcusably imprudent. I went on my hands and knees, and brought my face\r\nnearly on a level with hers, and gazed on those glaring eyes, and that\r\nhorrible countenance, until I seemed to feel the deathly influence of a\r\nspell stealing over me. I was not afraid, but every mental and bodily\r\npower was in a manner suspended. My countenance, perhaps, alarmed her,\r\nfor she sprang on me, fastened herself on my face, and bit through both\r\nmy lips. She then darted down stairs, and, I believe, was never seen\r\nagain. I always have nitrate of silver in my pocket, even now I am never\r\nwithout it; I washed myself, and applied the caustic with some severity\r\nto the wound; and my medical adviser and valued friend, Mr. Millington,\r\npunished me still more after I got home. My object was attained,\r\nalthough at somewhat too much cost, for the expression of that brute's\r\ncountenance will never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe later symptoms of rabies in this animal, no one, perhaps, has had\r\nthe opportunity of observing: we witness only the sullenness and the\r\nferocity.\r\n\r\n'Rabies in the Fowl'.--Dr. Ashburner and Mr. King inoculated a hen with\r\nthe saliva from a rabid cow. They made two incisions through the\r\nintegument, under the wings, and then well rubbed into these cuts the\r\nfoam taken from the cow's mouth. She was after this let loose among\r\nother fowls in the poultry-yard. The incisions soon healed, and their\r\nplaces could with difficulty be discovered. Ten weeks passed over, when\r\nshe was observed to refuse her food, and to run at the other fowls. She\r\nhad a strange wild appearance, and her eyes were blood-shot. Early on\r\nthe following morning her legs became contracted, so that she very soon\r\nlost the power of standing upright. She remained sitting a long time,\r\nwith the legs rigid, refusing food and water, and appearing very\r\nirritable when touched. She died in the evening, immediately after\r\ndrinking a large quantity of water which had been offered to her.\r\n\r\n'Rabies in the Badger'.--Hufeland, in his valuable Journal of Practical\r\nMedicine, relates a case of a rabid female badger attacking two boys.\r\nShe bit them both, but she fastened on the thigh of one of them, and was\r\ndestroyed in the act of sucking his blood. The poor fellow died\r\nhydrophobous, but the other escaped. This fact, certainly, gives us no\r\nidea of the general character of the disease in this animal; but it\r\nspeaks volumes as to its ferocity.\r\n\r\n'Rabies in the Wolf'.--Rabies is ushered in by nearly the same symptoms,\r\nand pursues the same course in the wolf us in the dog, with this\r\ndifference, which would be readily expected, that his ferocity and the\r\nmischief which he accomplishes are much greater. The dog hunts out his\r\nown species, and his fury is principally directed against them;\r\nalthough, if he meets with a flock of sheep, or a herd of cattle, he\r\nreadily attacks them, and, perhaps, bites the greater part of them. The\r\ndog, however, frequently turns out of his way to avoid the human being,\r\nand seldom attacks him without provocation. The wolf, on the contrary,\r\nalthough he commits fearful ravages among the sheep and cattle, searches\r\nout the human being as his favorite prey. He conceals himself near the\r\nentrance to the village, and steals upon and wounds every passenger that\r\nhe can get at. There are several accounts of more than twenty persons\r\nhaving been bitten by one wolf; and there is a fearful history of\r\nsixteen persons perishing from the bite of one of these animals. This is\r\nin perfect agreement with the account which I have given of the\r\nconnexion between the previous temper and habits of the rabid dog, and\r\nthe mischief that he effects under the influence of this malady. The\r\nwolf, as he wanders in the forest, regards the human being as his\r\npersecutor and foe; and, in the paroxysm of rabid fury, he is most eager\r\nto avenge himself on his natural enemy. Strange stories are told of the\r\narts to which he has recourse in order to accomplish his purpose. In the\r\ngreat majority of cases he steals unawares upon his victim, and the\r\nmischief is effected before the wood-cutter or the villager is conscious\r\nof his danger.\r\n\r\nThe following observations and experiments respecting rabies, by Dr.\r\nHertwich, Professor at the Veterinary School at Berlin, are well worthy\r\nof attention.\r\n\r\n1. Out of fifty dogs that had been inoculated with virus taken from a\r\nrabid animal of the same species, fourteen only were infected.\r\n\r\n2. In the cases where inoculation had been practised without effect, no\r\nreason could be assigned why the disease should not have taken place.\r\nThis consequently proves that the malady is similar to others of a\r\ncontagious nature, and that there must exist a predisposition in the\r\nindividual to receive the disease before it can occur. In one\r\nexperiment, a mastiff dog, aged four years, was inoculated without\r\nexhibiting any symptoms of the malady, while seven others, who had been\r\ninoculated at the same time and place, soon became rabid. Several of\r\nthese animals had been inoculated several times before any symptoms\r\nshowed themselves, while in others, on the contrary, once was\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n3. It appears that in a state of doubtful rabies, one or two accidental\r\nor artificial inoculations are not sufficient to create a negative proof\r\nof its existence.\r\n\r\n4. This disease has never ben communicated to an individual from one\r\ninfected by means of the perspirable matter; this, therefore, is a proof\r\nthat the contagious part of the disease is not of a volatile nature.\r\n\r\n5. It does not only exist in the saliva and the mucus of the mouth, but\r\nlikewise in the blood and the parenchyma of the salivary glands; but not\r\nin the pulpy substance of the nerves.\r\n\r\n6. The power of communicating infection is found to exist in all stages\r\nof the confirmed disease, even twenty-four hours after the decease of\r\nthe rabid animal.\r\n\r\n7. The morbid virus, when administered internally, appears to be\r\nincapable of communicating this disease; inasmuch as of twenty dogs to\r\nwhom was given a certain quantity, not one exhibited the least symptom\r\nof rabies.\r\n\r\n8. The application of the saliva upon recent wounds appears to have been\r\nas often succeeded by confirmed rabies as when the dog had been bitten\r\nby a rabid animal.\r\n\r\n9. It cannot now be doubled that the disease is produced by the wound\r\nitself, as was supposed by M. Girard of Lyons, not by the fright of the\r\nindividual, according to the opinion of others, but only from the\r\nabsorption of the morbid virus from its surface.\r\n\r\n10. Several experiments have proved to me the little reliance there is\r\nto be placed on the opinions of Baden and Capello, who believe that, in\r\nthose dogs who become rabid after the bite of an animal previously\r\nattacked with this disease, the contagious properties of the saliva is\r\nnot continued, but only exists in those primarily bitten.\r\n\r\n11. During the period of incubation of the virus there are no morbid,\r\nlocal, or general alterations of structure or function to be seen in the\r\ninfected animal; neither are there any vesicles to be perceived on the\r\ninferior surface of the tongue, nor any previous symptoms which are\r\nfound in other contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n12. This disease is generally at its height at the end of fifty days\r\nafter either artificial or accidental inoculation; and the author has\r\nnever known it to manifest itself at a later period.\r\n\r\n13. It is quite an erroneous idea to suppose that dogs in a state of\r\nhealth are enabled to distinguish, at first sight, a rabid animal,\r\ninasmuch as they never refuse their food when mixed with the secretions\r\nof those infected. [3]\r\n\r\nThe following singular trial respecting the death of a child by\r\nhydrophobia is worth quoting:\r\n\r\n'Jones v. Parry.'--The plaintiff is a labourer, who gets only fourteen\r\nshillings a week to support himself and his family. The defendant is his\r\nneighbour, and keeps a public-house. This was an action brought by the\r\nplaintiff to recover damages against the defendant for the loss of his\r\nson, who was bitten by the defendant's dog, and afterwards became\r\naffected with rabies, of which disease he died.\r\n\r\nIt appeared in the evidence that the defendant's dog had, some time ago,\r\nbeen bitten by another dog; in consequence of which this dog was tied in\r\nthe cellar, but the length of the rope which was allowed him enabled him\r\nto go to a considerable distance. The plaintiff's child knew the dog,\r\nhaving often played with him when he was at large. Some time ago the\r\nchild crossed the street, near to the place where the dog was fastened,\r\nwho rushed out of the place in which he was confined to where the child\r\nstood, sprung upon him, and bit him sadly in the face, and afterwards\r\nviolently shook him. The child being thus wounded, a surgeon was sent\r\nfor, who, after having dressed him, and attended him for a certain time,\r\ngave directions that he should be taken to the sea-side, and bathed in\r\nthe salt water.\r\n\r\nThis having been continued for some time, the child was brought home,\r\nand, at the expiration of a month from the day on which he was bitten,\r\nbecame evidently and strangely ill. The surgeon proved beyond all\r\nshadow of doubt thai the child laboured under rabies; that he had the\r\nnever-failing symptoms of that dreadful affliction; and that a little\r\nwhile before he expired, he even barked like a dog. The surgeon's charge\r\nto the father for his attendance was'£1. 6s. 6d.', which, together with\r\nthe charge of the undertaker for the funeral of the child, amounted to\r\nbetween six and seven pounds. Application was made to the defendant to\r\ndefray this expense, which at first he expressed a willingness to comply\r\nwith, but afterwards refused; upon which this action was brought.\r\n\r\nAfter some time the defendant offered to pay the plaintiff the sum of\r\n'£6. 3s. 6d.', and the expense of the funeral and the surgeon, provided\r\nthe plaintiff would bear the expenses of the lawsuit, which he was not\r\nin a condition to do, as probably it would amount to more than that\r\nmoney. On this account, therefore, the action was now brought into\r\ncourt. There was no proof that the defendant knew or suspected his dog\r\nto be mad, previously to his attacking the boy; but an animal known to\r\nhave been bitten by a mad dog, ought either to have been at once\r\ndestroyed, or so secured that it was impossible for him to do mischief.\r\n\r\nLord Kenyon observed to the jury, that this was one of those causes\r\nwhich came home to the feelings of all, yet must not be carried farther\r\nthan justice demanded. A cause like this never, perhaps, before occurred\r\nin a court of justice; but there had been many resembling it in point of\r\nprinciple. If a dog, known to be ill-tempered and vicious, did any\r\nperson an injury without provocation, there could be no question that\r\nthe owner of the dog was answerable, in a court of justice, for the\r\ninjury inflicted. Here was a worse case. The dog by whom the child was\r\nbitten had been attacked by another that was undeniably rabid. His\r\nmaster was aware of this, and placed him in a state of partial\r\nconfinement--a confinement so lax, and so inefficient, that this poor\r\nchild had broken through it, and was bitten and died. What other people\r\nwould have done in such a situation he could not tell; but, if he were\r\nasked what he would do, he answered, he certainly would kill the dog,\r\nhowever much of a favourite he had been, because no atonement was within\r\nthe reach of his fortune to make to the injured party for such a\r\ndreadful visitation of Providence as this. It was not enough for the\r\nowner of such a dog to say, he took precaution to prevent mischief: he\r\nought to have made it impossible that mischief could happen; and,\r\ntherefore, as soon as there was any reasonable suspicion that the dog\r\nwas rabid, he ought to have destroyed him.\r\n\r\nBut, if the owner wished to save the animal, until he was satisfied of\r\nthe actual state of the case, he ought to have secured him, so that\r\nevery individual might be safe. Whether the defendant thought he had\r\ndone all that was necessary, his lordship did not know; but this he\r\nknew, that the dog was not perfectly secured, otherwise this misfortune\r\ncould not have happened.\r\n\r\nThe care which the defendant took in this case was not enough, and,\r\ntherefore, he had no doubt that this action was maintainable. The jury\r\nwould judge what damages they ought to give. He would refer this to\r\ntheir feelings. They could not avoid commiserating the distress of the\r\nfamily of this poor man. He should, however, observe to the jury, that\r\nthey must not give vindictive damages; but still he did not think that\r\ndamages merely to the amount of '£6'. or '£7'., which was stated to be\r\nthe expense of the funeral, &c., would at all meet the justice of the\r\ncase. He was inclined to advise them to go beyond that, although he did\r\nnot plead vindictive damages. There would be costs to be defrayed by the\r\nplaintiff, well known in the profession under the head of \"extra costs,\"\r\neven although he had a verdict. If the verdict had been at his disposal,\r\nhe would have taken care that these costs should have been borne by the\r\nparty that had been the cause of the injury. That appeared to him to be\r\nthe justice of the case.\r\n\r\nHe trusted that none who heard him would doubt his sincerity, when he\r\nsaid, he lamented the misfortune which had given birth to this action;\r\nand, with that qualification of the case, he must say that he was not\r\nsorry that this action had been brought. He thanked the plaintiff for\r\nbringing it; for it might be of public benefit. It would teach a lesson\r\nthat would not soon be forgotten, \"That a person, who knowingly keeps a\r\nvicious, dangerous animal, should be considered to be answerable for all\r\nthe acts of that animal.\" There were instances in which very large\r\ndamages had been given to repair such injuries. He did not say that the\r\npresent case called for large damages; but, if other cases of the same\r\nkind should be brought into court after this had been made public, he\r\nhoped the jury would go beyond the ordinary limits, and give verdicts\r\nwhich might operate 'in terrorem' on the offending parties.\r\n\r\nVerdict for the plaintiff--damages £36. [4]\r\n\r\nA child was bitten by a rabid dog at York, and became hydrophobous. All\r\npossibility of relief having vanished, the parents, desirous of putting\r\nan end to the agony of their child, or fearful of its doing mischief,\r\nsmothered it between two pillows. They were tried for murder, and found\r\nguilty. They were afterwards pardoned; but the intention of the\r\nprosecutor was that of deterring others from a similar practice, in a\r\nlike unfortunate situation [5].\r\n\r\nIn 1821, a physician, at Poissy, was sentenced to pay 8000 francs (£320)\r\nto a poor widow whose husband died of hydrophobia, in consequence of a\r\nbite from the physician's dog, he knowing that the dog had been bitten,\r\nyet not confining him.\r\n\r\n[Our author having written so extensively upon the subject of rabies, it\r\nwould seem superfluous in us to attempt to add anything more upon a\r\nsubject so ably and practically handled by one having so great\r\nopportunities to make personal observations. However, to allay the\r\nfeelings of many of our dogkilling citizens, we will not hesitate to\r\nassert that we do not place as much credence in the frequency of rabies\r\nas is generally done; but, on the other hand, are strongly led to\r\nbelieve that the accounts of this much-dreaded malady are greatly\r\nexaggerated both in this country and in England.\r\n\r\nThat there may be a few cases of rabies in our country in the course of\r\na year, we do not doubt; but, at the same time, we are satisfied that\r\nthe affection in its genuine form is quite rare, and that the great hue\r\nand cry made every season about mad dogs, is more the result of\r\nignorance and fright than of reality.\r\n\r\nOur limits in this publication would not allow us sufficient space to\r\nenlarge upon the many pathological questions naturally arising from a\r\nminute examination of this subject, more particularly as our views are\r\nsomewhat at variance with the generally received opinion, and which, of\r\ncourse, we would be forced to express with considerable diffidence,\r\nowing to the impossibility of collecting such evidence as might seem\r\nnecessary to substantiate any peculiar doctrine.\r\n\r\nThat tetanus, hysteria, and other spasmodic affections have often been\r\nmistaken for rabies, there is no doubt, and we can easily imagine the\r\nmental effect produced upon an individual of a highly nervous\r\ntemperament, by the knowledge of his being bitten by an animal known to\r\nbe hydrophobic; and we can, without difficulty, reconcile with our best\r\njudgment the belief 'that the workings of such an individual's\r\nimagination, occasioned by the never-ceasing dread of the horrid malady\r\nto which he is now exposed, might be sufficient to produce a train of\r\nsymptoms somewhat resembling the actual state of rabies.'\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of these nervous unfortunates, we might say to them,\r\nthat the statistics of this affection show a very considerable ratio in\r\nfavour of escape from inoculation when bitten, or of entire recovery\r\neven after the development of the disease, and that there are many\r\nother ills in the catalogue of medicine that they should take equal\r\npains to provide against as lyssa canina. We doubt not that the minds of\r\nmany will be relieved, when informed that John Hunter mentions an\r\ninstance, in which, out of twenty persons bitten by a rabid dog, only\r\none suffered from the malady; and that of fifty-nine dogs inoculated by\r\nProfessor Hertwick at the veterinary school of Berlin, only fourteen\r\nwere affected; and of eleven patients entrusted to the care of M. Blaise\r\nof Cluny, seven recovered after exhibiting greater or less degrees of\r\nspasmodic symptoms.\r\n\r\nIt may prove interesting to our readers, to insert in these pages an\r\naccount of the first two cases of rabies known in Philadelphia, and as\r\nrelated to us by a venerable and much-esteemed citizen, who is well\r\nknown in the scientific world as a gentleman of deep research, and we\r\nagree with him in opinion, that this much-dreaded disease is most\r\nfrequently the result of like causes, or rather that like symptoms often\r\ninduce the belief of the presence of this malady, when, in fact, no such\r\ndisease does exist.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the last century, there lived a tailor in Front\r\nstreet, near Market, in the midst of the most respectable people of that\r\nperiod; among the number was our esteemed friend Mr. Hembel, as also\r\nJudge Tilghman. This tailor possessed an ill-tempered little spaniel,\r\nwho, lounging about the street-door, attacked every one that passed by,\r\nsnapping and snarling in the most worrisome manner, more particularly at\r\nevery little urchin that invaded his \"right of pavement,\" and not\r\nunfrequently biting them or tearing their clothes from their back. The\r\nowner of the dog was appealed to on many occasions by the neighbours,\r\nbegging that the quarrelsome brute should either be disposed of or kept\r\nwithin doors. To all these solicitations and warnings the little tailor\r\npaid no heed, but continued stitching his breeches and cribbing his\r\ncustomers' goods, while the ugly little spaniel, without interruption,\r\namused himself by snapping at and biting the heels of the passers-by.\r\n\r\nThe nuisance at last became insufferable, and Judge Tilghman applied to\r\nMr. Hembel to assist him in getting rid of this troublesome brute; the\r\nlatter gentleman advised the administration of a small quantity of\r\nstrychnia, concealed in a portion of meat, which proposition was agreed\r\nupon and immediately carried into execution. A short time after the\r\nadministering of this dose the spaniel sickened, and retired from his\r\npost to the kitchen, which was in the basement, and where an Irish\r\ndomestic was engaged in washing; the dog appeared uneasy for a time, and\r\nsuddenly, being taken with the involuntary muscular convulsions that\r\nso frequently follow the administration of this powerful drug, ran\r\naround the kitchen yelping and howling at a most terrible rate, and\r\nultimately, to the no small discomfiture and amazement of the maid,\r\nsprang up into the wash-tub, at which unceremonious caper, on the part\r\nof the dog, the woman became greatly alarmed and ran out into the\r\nstreet, followed by the whole household, crying mad dog, which soon\r\nproduced an uproar in the neighbourhood, no one daring to satisfy\r\nhimself as to the correctness of the report, and all, perhaps, too\r\nignorant of the subject to discern the real cause of the animal's\r\nsingular behaviour. The tailor, still bearing a strong attachment to his\r\nunfortunate favourite, and being somewhat more daring than his\r\nneighbours, ventured, at length, to peep into the kitchen to see the\r\nstate of affairs, and seeing the dog still convulsed and foaming at the\r\nmouth, was more than ever confirmed in the belief of hydrophobia, and\r\nknowing full well the biting propensities of the animal, independent of\r\nrabies, concluded, much to the relief of every one, to shoot him. The\r\nnext step in the programme was the dragging out and consigning of the\r\npatient to a watery grave, which was accomplished by placing, with a\r\npair of tongs, a noose over the head of the animal, and thus hauling him\r\nout of the basement window amid the cheers of the assembled populace who\r\nsoon cast him into the Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe second case of rabies as related to us by Mr. Hembel was as\r\nfollows:--In 1793 the barbers of the city were in the habit of going\r\naround to the various boarding-houses for the purpose of shaving the\r\nvisitors in their apartments, instead of accommodating them, as at the\r\npresent time, in their own establishments.\r\n\r\nOne of these knights of the razor, living also in Front street, when\r\ngoing to and from a fashionable boarding-house in the vicinity, was not\r\nunfrequently assailed by a small cur who often took him by the heels\r\nwhen hurrying along.\r\n\r\nTo get rid of this annoying little animal as speedily and secretly as\r\npossible, he had recourse to the powers of strychnia, which produced in\r\na very short time similar effects upon the poor victim, and the result\r\nwas another great hue and cry about mad dogs.\r\n\r\nThese authentic and remarkable cases of hydrophobia were heralded in all\r\nthe papers of the day, which, from that time forward, were filled with\r\nnotes of caution to all dog-owners.\r\n\r\nOf the 'treatment' of rabies we will make but a few remarks, as of the\r\nimmense number of specifics proposed for this disease, amounting in all\r\nto several hundred, few or none can be relied on to the exclusion of the\r\nothers; but those medicines, perhaps, known as opiates or\r\nanti-spasmodics, claim a larger share of attention than any others in\r\ncombating the disease after its development. In looking over the very\r\noriginal works of Jacques Du Fouilloux, a worthy cynegetical writer of\r\nthe sixteenth century, we find a prescription that was supposed by many\r\nto be an infallible specific for this disease, and as it appears to us\r\nquite as certain in its effects on the animal economy as many others of\r\nthe inert substances that have been lauded to the skies both in our\r\ncountry and in other parts of the world as antidotes, we take the\r\nliberty of transcribing it, as also of adding a translation of his\r\nquaint French.\r\n\r\n'Autre recepte par mots preservants la rage.'\r\n\r\n'Ay appris vne recepte d'vn Gentil-homme, en Bretaigne, lequel faisoit\r\nde petits escriteaux, où n'y auoit seulement que deux lignes, lesquels\r\nil mettoit en vne omellette d'oeufs, puis les faisoit aualer aux chiens\r\nqui auorient esté mords de chiens enragez, et auoit dedans l'escriteau,\r\n'Y Ran Quiran Cafram Cafratrem, Cafratrosque'. Lesquels mots disoit\r\nestre singuliers pour empescher les chiens de la rage, mais quant à moi\r\nie n'y adiouste pas foy.\r\n\r\nI have learned a recipe from a nobleman of Brittany, which is composed\r\nof a written charm, in which there are only two lines; these he put in\r\nan omelet of eggs, he then made the dogs that had been bitten by a rabid\r\nanimal swallow them. There was on the paper \"'Y Ran Quiran Cafram\r\nCafratrem, Cafratrosque'\". These words were said to be singularly\r\nefficacious in preventing madness in dogs, but for my part I do not\r\ncredit it.\r\n\r\nAlthough our quaint author considered the above charm even too\r\nmarvellous for his belief, we give below his own prescription in which\r\nhe placed implicit confidence, but, no doubt, on trial it would prove\r\n'\"as singularly efficacious\" as the other'.\r\n\r\nBaing pour lauer, les chiens, quand ils ont esté mords des chiens\r\nenragez, de peur qu'ils enragent.\r\n\r\nQuand les chiens sont mords ou desbrayez de chiens enragez, il faut\r\nincontinent emplir vne pippe d'eau, puis prendre quatre boisseaux de sel\r\net les ietter dedans, en meslaut fort le sel auec vn baston pour le\r\nfaire fondre soudainement: et quand il sera fondu, faut mettre le chien\r\ndedans, et le plonger tout, sans qu'il paroisse rien, par neuf fois:\r\npuis quand il sera bien laué, faut le laisser aller, celà l'empeschera\r\nd'enrager.\r\n\r\nWhen a dog has been bitten or scratched by another affected with\r\nmadness, we must immediately take a tub of water and throw into it four\r\nbushels of salt, stirring it briskly with a stick to make it dissolve\r\nquickly. When the salt shall be dissolved, put the dog into the bath,\r\nand plunge him well nine times, so that the bath shall cover him each\r\ntime; now that he is well washed you may let him go, as this will\r\nprevent his becoming rabid.\r\n\r\nHaving given publicity to the two preceding valuable receipts, we must\r\nbe pardoned for adding our own views upon this point, as a caution to\r\nthose who may not feel sufficient faith in the remedies above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe wound should be thoroughly washed and cleansed as soon as possible\r\nafter the bite is inflicted: no sucking of the parts, as is advised by\r\nmany, for the purpose of extracting the poison, as the presence of a\r\nsmall abrasion of the lips or interior of the mouth would most assuredly\r\nsubject the parts to inoculation. If the wound be ragged, the edges may\r\nbe taken off with a pair of sharp scissors; the wound must then be\r\nthoroughly cauterized with nitrate of silver (lunar caustic), being sure\r\nto introduce the caustic into the very depths of the wound, so that it\r\nwill reach every particle of poison that may have insinuated itself into\r\nthe flesh. If the wound is too small to admit of the stick of caustic,\r\nit may be enlarged by the knife, taking care, however, not to carry the\r\npoison into the fresh cut, which can be avoided by wiping the knife at\r\neach incision. Should the wound be made on any of the limbs, a bandage\r\nmay be placed around it during the application of these remedies, the\r\nmore effectually to prevent the absorption of the virus. Nitrate of\r\nsilver is a most powerful neutralizer of specific poisons, and the\r\naffected parts will soon come away with the slough, no dressings being\r\nnecessary, except perhaps olive oil, if there should be much\r\ninflammation of the parts. If the above plan be pursued, the patient\r\nneed be under no apprehension as to the result, but make his mind\r\nperfectly easy on the point. This is the course generally pursued by the\r\nveterinary surgeons of Europe, and there are but few of them who have not,\r\nsome time in their practice, been bitten and often severely lacerated by\r\nrabid animals; nevertheless, we never hear of their having suffered any\r\nbad effects from such accidents. If caustic be not at hand, the wound\r\nmay be seared over with red-hot iron, which will answer as good a\r\npurpose, although much more painful in its operation. Mr. Blaine, in\r\nclosing his able and scientific article on this subject, very justly\r\nremarks,\r\n\r\n  \"Would I could instil into such minds the 'uncertainty' of the disease\r\n  appearing at all; that is, even when no means have been used; and the\r\n  'perfect security' they may feel who have submitted to the preventive\r\n  treatment detailed. I have been bitten several times, Mr. Youatt\r\n  several also; yet in neither of us was any dread occasioned: our\r\n  experience taught us the 'absolute certainty' of the 'preventive'\r\n  means; and such I take on me to pronounce they always prove, when\r\n  performed with dexterity and judgment.\" We acknowledge ourselves a\r\n  convert to this gentleman's doctrine; and feel satisfied that if the\r\n  above course be adopted, there need be no fear whatever of the\r\n  development of this frightful affection.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'La Folie des Animaux', by M. Perquin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The physician Apollonius, having been bitten by a rabid\r\ndog, induced another dog to lick the wound,\r\n\r\n  \"ut idem medicus esset qui vulneris auctor fuit.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 'Journal Pratique de Méd.

In periodic ophthalmia--that pest of the equine race and\r\nopprobrium of the veterinary profession--the cornea becomes suddenly\r\nopaque, the iris pale, the aqueous humour turbid, the capsule of the\r\nlens cloudy, and blindness is the result. After a time, however, the\r\ncornea clears up, and becomes as bright as ever; but the lens continues\r\nimpervious to light, and vision is lost.\r\n\r\nOphthalmia in the dog presents us with symptoms altogether different.\r\nThe conjunctiva is red; that portion of it which spreads over the\r\nsclerotica is highly injected, and the cornea is opaque. As the disease\r\nproceeds, and even at a very early period of its progress, an ulcer\r\nappears on the centre; at first superficial, but enlarging and deepening\r\nuntil it has penetrated the cornea, and the aqueous humour has escaped.\r\nGranulations then spring from the edges of the ulcer, rapidly enlarge,\r\nand protrude through the lids. Under proper treatment, however, or by a\r\nprocess of nature, these granulations cease to sprout; they begin to\r\ndisappear; the ulcer diminishes; it heals; scarcely a trace of it can be\r\nseen; the cornea recovers its perfect transparency, and vision is not in\r\nthe slightest degree impaired.\r\n\r\nThere is a state of the orbit which requires some consideration. It is\r\nconnected with the muscles employed in mastication. Generally speaking,\r\nthe food of the dog requires no extraordinary degree of mastication, nor\r\nis there usually any great time employed in this operation. That muscle\r\nwhich is most employed in the comminution of the food, namely, the\r\ntemporal muscle, has its action very much limited by the position of the\r\nbony socket of the eye; yet sufficient room is left for all the force\r\nthat can be required. In some dogs, either for purposes of offence or\r\ndefence, or the more effectual grasping of the prey, a sudden violent\r\nexertion of muscular power, and a consequent contraction of the temporal\r\nmuscle, are requisite, but for which the imperfect socket of the orbit\r\ndoes not seem to afford sufficient scope and room. There is an admirable\r\nprovision for this in the removal of a certain portion of the orbital\r\nprocess of the frontal bone on the outer and upper part of the external\r\nridge, and the substitution of an elastic cartilage. This cartilage\r\nmomentarily yields to the swelling of the muscles; and then, by its\r\ninherent elasticity, the external ridge of the orbit resumes its\r\npristine form. The orbit of the dog, the pig, and the cat, exhibits this\r\nsingular mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe horse is, to a certain extent, also an illustration of this. He\r\nrequires an extended field of vision to warn him of the approach of his\r\nenemies in his wild state, and a direction of the orbits somewhat\r\nforward to enable him to pursue with safety the headlong course to which\r\nwe sometimes urge him; and for this purpose his eyes are placed more\r\nforward than those of cattle, sheep, or swine. That which Mr. Percivall\r\nstates of the horse is true of our other domesticated animals:\r\n\r\n  \"The eyeball is placed within the anterior or more capacious part of\r\n  the orbit, nearer to the frontal than to the temporal side, with a\r\n  degree of prominence peculiar to the individual, and, within certain\r\n  limits, variable at his will.\"\r\n\r\nIn many of the carnivorous animals the orbit encroaches on the bones of\r\nthe face. A singular effect is also produced on the countenance, both\r\nwhen the animal is growling over his prey and when he is devouring it.\r\nThe temporal muscle is violently acted upon; it presses upon the\r\ncartilage that forms part of the external ridge; that again forces\r\nitself upon and protrudes the eye, and hence the peculiar ferocity of\r\nexpression which is observed at that time. The victims of these\r\ncarnivorous animals are also somewhat provided against danger by the\r\nacuteness of sight with which they are gifted. Adipose matter also\r\nexists in a considerable quantity in the orbit of the eye, which enables\r\nit to revolve by the slightest contraction of the muscles.\r\n\r\nWe should scarcely expect to meet with cases of fracture of the orbital\r\narch in the dog, because, in that animal, cartilage, or a\r\ncartilago-ligamentous substance, occupies a very considerable part of\r\nthat arch; but I have again and again, among the cruelties that are\r\npractised on the inferior creation, seen the cartilage partly, or even\r\nentirely, torn asunder. I have never been able satisfactorily to\r\nascertain the existence of this during life; but I have found it on\r\nthose whom I have recommended to be destroyed on account of the brutal\r\nusage which they had experienced. Blows somewhat higher, or on the thick\r\ntemporal muscle of this animal, will very rarely produce a fracture.\r\n\r\nA few cases of disease in the eye may be interesting and useful.\r\n\r\n'Case' I.--The eyes of a favourite spaniel were found inflamed and\r\nimpatient of light. Nothing wrong had been perceived on the preceding\r\nday. No ulceration could be observed on the cornea, and there was but a\r\nslight mucous discharge. An infusion of digitalis, with twenty times the\r\nquantity of tepid water, was employed as a collyrium, and an aloetic\r\nball administered. On the following day the eyes were more inflamed, The\r\ncollyrium and the aloes were employed as before, and a seton inserted in\r\nthe poll.\r\n\r\nThree or four days afterwards the redness was much diminished, the\r\ndischarge from the eye considerably lessened, and the dog was sent home.\r\nThe seton, however, was continued, with an aloetic ball on every third\r\nor fourth day.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days after this the eyes were perfectly cured and the seton\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n'Case' II.--The eye is much inflamed and the brow considerably\r\nprotruded.\r\n\r\nThis was supposed to be caused by a bite. I vainly endeavoured to bring\r\nthe lid over the swelling. I scarified the lid freely, and ordered the\r\nbleeding to be encouraged by the constant application of warm water, and\r\nphysic-ball to be given.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the brow was found to be scarcely or at all\r\nreduced, and the eye could not be closed. I drew out the haw with a\r\ncrooked needle, and cut it off closely with sharp scissors. The excised\r\nportion was as large as a small-kidney-bean. The fomentation was\r\ncontinued five days afterwards, and the patient then dismissed cured.\r\n\r\n'Case' III.--A pointer was brought in a sad state of mange. Redness,\r\nscurf, and eruptions were on almost every part. Apply the mange ointment\r\nand the alterative and physic balls. On the following day there was an\r\nulcer on the centre of the cornea, with much appearance of pain and\r\nimpatience of light. Apply an infusion of digitalis, with the liquor\r\nplumbi diacetatis. He was taken away on the twelfth day, the mange\r\napparently cured, and the inflammation of the eye considerably lessened.\r\nA fortnight afterwards this also appeared to be cured.\r\n\r\n'Case' IV.--A spaniel had been bitten by a large dog. There was no wound\r\nof the lids, but the eye was protruded from the socket. I first tried\r\nwhether it could be reduced by gentle pressure, but I could not\r\naccomplish it. I then introduced the blunt end of a curved needle\r\nbetween the eye and the lid; and thus drawing up the lid with the right\r\nhand, while I pressed gently on the eye with the left hand, I\r\naccomplished my object. I then subtracted three ounces of blood and gave\r\na physic-ball. On the following day the eye was hot and red, with some\r\ntumefaction. The pupil was moderately contracted, but was scarcely\r\naffected by any change of light. The dog was sent home, with some\r\nextract of goulard, and a fortnight afterwards was quite well.\r\n\r\n'Case' V.--A dog received a violent blow on the right eye. Immediate\r\nblindness occurred, or the dog could apparently just discern the\r\ndifference between light and darkness, but could not distinguish\r\nparticular objects. The pupil was expanded and immovable. A\r\npink-coloured hue could be perceived on looking earnestly into the eye.\r\nA seton was introduced into the poll, kept there nearly a month, and\r\noften stimulated rather sharply. General remedies of almost every kind\r\nwere tried: depletion was carried to its full extent, the electric fluid\r\nwas had recourse to; but at the expiration of nine weeks the case was\r\nabandoned and the dog destroyed. Permission to examine him was refused.\r\n\r\nI have, in two or three instances, witnessed decided cases of dropsy of\r\nthe eye, accumulation of fluid taking place in both the anterior and\r\nposterior chambers of the eye; there was also effusion of blood in the\r\nchambers, but in one case only was there the slightest benefit produced\r\nby the treatment adopted, and in that there was gradual absorption of\r\nthe effused fluid.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time there was another similar case. A pointer had\r\nsuddenly considerable opacity of one eye, without any known cause: the\r\nother eye was not in the least degree affected. The dog had not been out\r\nof the garden for more than a week. The eye was ordered to be fomented\r\nwith warm water.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the inflammation had increased, and the adipose\r\nmatter was protruded at both the inner and outer canthus. The eye was\r\nbathed frequently with a goulard lotion. On the fourth day the eyeball\r\nwas still more inflamed, and the projections at both canthi were\r\nincreased. A curved needle was passed through both eyes, and there was\r\nconsiderable bleeding. On the following day the inflammation began to\r\nsubside. At the expiration of a week scarcely any disease remained, and\r\nthe eye became as transparent as ever.\r\n\r\nA curious ease of congenital blindness was brought to my infirmary. A\r\nfemale pointer puppy, eight weeks old, had both her eyes of their\r\nnatural size and formation, but the inner edge of the iris was strangely\r\ndiseased. The pupil was curiously four-cornered, and very small. There\r\nhung out of the pupil a grayish-white fibrous matter, which appeared to\r\nbe the remainder of the pupillary membrane.\r\n\r\nSix months afterwards we examined her again, and found that the pupil\r\nwas considerably enlarged, and properly shaped, and the white skin had\r\nvanished. In the back-ground of the eye there was a faint yellow-green\r\nlight, and the dog not only showed sensibility to light, but some\r\nperception of external objects. At this period we lost sight of her.\r\n\r\nA very considerable improvement has taken place with regard to the\r\ntreatment of the enlarged or protruded ball of the eye. A dog may get\r\ninto a skirmish, and have his eye forced from the socket. If there is\r\nlittle or no bleeding, the case will probably be easily and successfully\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nThe eye must, first, be thoroughly washed, and not a particle of grit\r\nmust be left. A little oil, a crooked needle, and a small piece of soft\r\nrag should be procured. The blunt end of the needle should he dipped\r\ninto the oil, and run round the inside of the lid, first above and then\r\nbelow. The operator will next--his fingers being oiled--press upon the\r\nprotruded eye gently, yet somewhat firmly, changing the pressure from\r\none part of the eye to the other, in order to force it back into the\r\nsocket.\r\n\r\nIf, after a couple of minutes' trial, he does not succeed, let him again\r\noil the eye on the inside and the out, and once more introduce the blunt\r\nend of the needle, attempting to carry it upwards under the lid with two\r\nor three fingers pressing on the eye, and the points of pressure being\r\nfrequently changed. In by far the greater number of cases, the eye will\r\nbe saved.\r\n\r\nIf it is impracticable to cause the eye to retract, a needle with a\r\nthread attached must be passed through it, the eye being then drawn as\r\nforward as possible and cut off close to the lids. The bleeding will\r\nsoon cease and the lids perfectly close.\r\n\r\n'Ophthalmia' is a disease to which the dog is often liable. It is the\r\nresult of exposure either to heat or to cold, or violent exertion; it is\r\nremedied by bleeding, purging, and the application of sedative medicine,\r\nas the acetate of lead or the tincture of opium. When the eye is\r\nconsiderably inflamed, in addition to the application of tepid or cold\r\nwater, either the inside of the lids or the white of the eye may be\r\nlightly touched with the lancet. From exposure to cold, or accident or\r\nviolence, inflammation often spreads on the eye to a considerable\r\ndegree, the pupil is clouded, and small streaks of blood spread over the\r\nopaque cornea. The mode of treatment just described must be pursued.\r\n\r\nThe crystalline lens occasionally becomes opaque. There is cataract. It\r\nmay be the result of external injury or of internal predisposition. Old\r\ndogs are particularly subject to cataract. That which arises from\r\naccident, or occasionally disease, may, although seldom, be reinstated,\r\nespecially in the young dog, and both eyes may become sound; but, in the\r\nold, the slow-growing opacity will, almost to a certainty, terminate in\r\ncataract.\r\n\r\nThere is occasionally an enlargement of the eye, or rather an\r\naccumulation of fluid within the eye, to a very considerable extent. No\r\nexternal application seems to have the slightest effect in reducing the\r\nbulk of the eye. If it is punctured, much inflammation ensues, and the\r\neye gradually wastes away.\r\n\r\nIn 'amaurosis', the eye is beautifully clear, and, for a little while,\r\nthis clearness imposes upon the casual observer; but there is a peculiar\r\npellucid appearance about the eye--a preternatural and unchanging\r\nbrightness. In the horse, the sight occasionally returns, but I have\r\nnever seen this in the dog.\r\n\r\nThe occasional glittering of the eyes of the dog has been often\r\nobserved. The cat, the wolf, some carnivora, and also sheep, cows, and\r\nhorses, occasionally exhibit the same glittering. Pallas imagined that\r\nthe light of these animals emanated from the nervous membrane of the\r\neye, and considered it to be an electrical phenomenon. It is found,\r\nhowever, in every animal that possesses a 'tapetum lucidum'. The\r\nshining, however, never takes place in complete darkness. It is neither\r\nproduced voluntarily, nor in consequence of any moral emotion, but\r\nsolely from the reflection that falls on the eye.\r\n\r\n[The eye and its diseases being so concisely treated by Mr. Youatt, we\r\nare emboldened to add a more full and particular treatise on this\r\ninteresting subject, couched in language the most simple, and we trust\r\nsufficiently plain to be understood by the most unscientific patron of\r\nthe canine race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYE AND ITS DISEASES.\r\n\r\nTHE NICTITATING MEMBRANE.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat astonishing that an organ, so delicate and so much\r\nexposed as the eye of the hunting dog necessarily is, should not more\r\nfrequently be attacked with disease, or suffer from the thorns,\r\npoisonous briars, and bushes that so constantly oppose their progress\r\nwhile in search of game. Nature, ever wise in her undertakings, while\r\nendowing this organ with extreme sensibility, also furnished it with the\r\nmeans of protecting itself in some measure against the many evils that\r\nso constantly threaten its destruction.\r\n\r\nThe plica semilunaris, haw or nictitating membrane, though not as\r\nlargely developed in the dog as in some other animals, is, nevertheless,\r\nof sufficient size to afford considerable protection to the ball of the\r\neye, and assists materially in preventing the accumulation of seeds and\r\nother minute particles within the conjunctiva. This delicate membrane is\r\nfound at the inner canthus of the eye, and can be drawn at pleasure over\r\na portion of the globe, so as to free its surface from any foreign\r\nsubstances that might be upon it. Although the eye of the dog is\r\nattacked by many diseases, almost as numerous as those of the human\r\nbeing, still they are much less frequent and far more tractable.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTHAMALIA--SIMPLE INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\nIn its mild form this disease is frequently met with, and easily yields\r\nto the administration of the proper remedies, but when it appears as an\r\nepidemic, in a kennel, it proves more stubborn. The discharge in\r\nepidemic ophthalmia, when carried from one dog to the eyes of another,\r\nno doubt is contagious, and, therefore, it is necessary to separate dogs\r\nas much from each other as possible during any prevalent epidemic of\r\nthis nature.\r\n\r\nThe disease announces itself by slight redness of the conjunctiva,\r\ntenderness to light, and increased flow of the secretions.\r\n\r\nThe eyeball appears retracted in its socket, and more moist and\r\ntransparent than usual. The infected vessels of the conjunctiva form a\r\nspecies of net-work, and can be moved about with this membrane, showing\r\nthat the inflammation is entirely superficial, and not penetrating the\r\nother coverings of the eye. Extravasation of blood within the\r\nconjunctiva, (bloodshot,) is also not an uncommon appearance, but is\r\nfrequently the first symptom that draws our attention to the malady.\r\n\r\nAs the disease progresses, the conjunctiva becomes more vascular, the\r\nphotophobia intolerable, the cornea itself becomes opaque, and sometimes\r\nexhibits a vascular appearance.  There is considerable itching of the\r\nball, as evinced by the disposition of the dog to close the eye. If the\r\ndisease progresses in its course, unchecked by any remediate means, the\r\ncornea may lose its vitality, ulceration commence, and the sight be for\r\never destroyed by the bursting and discharge of the contents of the eye.\r\n\r\n'Causes.'--Simple canine opthalmia proceeds from many causes, distinct\r\nin their character, but all requiring pretty much the same treatment.\r\nBad feeding, bad lodging, want of exercise, extremes of heat, and cold,\r\nare the most active agents in producing this affection.\r\n\r\n'Treatment.'--The disease in its mild form is very tractable, and\r\nrequires but little attention; soothing applications, in connexion with\r\nconfinement to an obscure apartment and low diet, will generally correct\r\nthe affection in its forming stage.\r\n\r\nIn all inflammations of the eye, tepid applications we consider\r\npreferable to cold, the latter producing a temporary reaction, but no\r\npermanent good, while the former exerts a soothing and relaxing\r\ninfluence over the tissues and parts to which they are applied.\r\n\r\nWeak vinegar and water, with a small proportion of laudanum, we have\r\nfrequently seen used with advantage as a wash in this complaint.\r\n\r\nWhen there is fever, it will be necessary to bleed, and purge.\r\nScarifying the conjunctiva with the point of a lancet, has been resorted\r\nto by some veterinary surgeons with success.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC OPHTHALMIA.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease assumes this form, the discharge from the eyes is\r\nlessened, and becomes more thick, the conjunctiva is not of such a\r\nbright arterial red, but more of a brick-dust colour, and the inner side\r\nof the lids when exposed will present small prominences and ulcerations.\r\n\r\n'Treatment.'--More stimulating collyria will now be necessary, as\r\nsolutions of sulphate of zinc, copper, acetate of lead, &c. See No. 1,\r\n2, 3, of the Collyria. The direct application of sulphate of copper, or\r\nnitrate of silver, will often be of great benefit in changing the action\r\nof the parts.\r\n\r\nThe lids should be turned down and brushed over two or three times with\r\nthe above articles in substance, and the dog restrained for a few\r\nmoments to prevent him from scratching during the temporary pain\r\ninflicted upon him by the application.\r\n\r\nLaudanum dropped in the eye will also prove very beneficial, allaying\r\nthe itching and pain, at the same time stimulating the organs to renewed\r\naction. If the disease does not succumb under this treatment, a seton\r\nplaced in the pole will generally conquer it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAUMATIC OPHTHALMIA\r\n\r\nis produced by wounds of poisoned briars, stings of insects, bites of\r\nother dogs, the scratching of cats, or the actual presence of foreign\r\nbodies in the eye itself, which latter cause frequently occurs, and is\r\noften overlooked by the sportsman.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--This species of ophthalmia is best subdued by the\r\napplication of emollient poultices, depletion, purgation and cooling\r\nwashes. If a seed, small briar, or other substance has got in under the\r\nlids, or inserted itself in the globe of the eye, the dog keeps the eye\r\nclosed, it waters freely, and in a short time becomes red and inflamed.\r\nThe removal of the article alone, will generally produce a cure;\r\nsometimes it is necessary to use a cooling wash and administer a purge\r\nor two. Great care should he had for the extraction of extraneous\r\nsubstances from the eyes of dogs, as their presence often causes great\r\nsuffering to the animal even while diligently employed in the field. The\r\nwriter has seen dogs more than once rendered useless while hunting, by\r\ngrass, cloverseeds, or other small particles burying themselves under\r\nthe lids.\r\n\r\n'Ophthalmia of Distemper'.--This species of inflammation will be spoken\r\nof when treating of this latter affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPATHETIC OPHTHALMIA\r\n\r\narises from the presence of some other disease located in another\r\nportion of the body, as derangement of the stomach, mange, surfeit, &c.\r\nThe presence of one of these affections will indicate the cause of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--Soothing applications to the organ itself, and remedies\r\nfor the removal of the primary affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROPHTHALMIA\r\n\r\nthough not a common affection in the canine race, is occasionally met\r\nwith; several cases have come under the observation of the writer, and\r\nno doubt there are but few dog-fanciers who have not seen the eyeballs\r\nof some dog suffering with this malady, ready to start from their\r\nsockets.\r\n\r\nThis affection depends upon a superabundance of the humours of the eye,\r\noccasioned by over-secretion, or a want of power in the absorbent\r\nvessels to carry off the natural secretions of the parts.\r\n\r\nOld dogs are more apt to suffer from this disease than young dogs:\r\nnevertheless, the latter are not by any means exempt; we once saw a pup,\r\na few days old, with the globe of the eye greatly extended by this\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nAs the disease progresses, the eye becomes more hard and tender, the\r\nsight is greatly impaired, and ultimately, if not arrested, the eye\r\nbursts, discharges its contents, and total blindness ensues, greatly to\r\nthe relief of the poor animal.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--This disease is very intractable, and is to be combated by\r\nsaline purges, bleeding, and stimulating application to the organ\r\nitself. Mercurial ointment, rubbed over the eyebrow, will assist in\r\nstimulating the absorbents.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease has progressed for a long time, and the pain, as is\r\noften the case, seems intense, it will save the animal great suffering,\r\nby opening the ball and allowing the humours to escape. This may be done\r\nby puncturing the cornea or the sclerotic coat with a needle. Setons\r\nintroduced along the spine would have a good effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGENITAL BLINDNESS\r\n\r\noccasionally occurs throughout a whole litter, no doubt being entailed\r\nupon the progeny of those dogs who have defective vision, or who are old\r\nand infirm at the time of copulation. The best and only remedy is speedy\r\ndrowning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARACT\r\n\r\nconsists in the partial or complete opacity of the crystalline lens; it\r\nresults from numerous causes, and is more frequent in the old than the\r\nyoung subject. In old dogs both eyes are usually attacked, producing\r\nabsolute blindness, while in young animals one eye alone is generally\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\n'Causes.'--Old age, hard work, and bad feeding, are the agents most\r\nactive in the production of this affection; it generally comes on\r\nslowly, but sometimes very quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease occurs in young dogs, it is generally the result of\r\nwounds or blows over the head, convulsions and falls.\r\n\r\n'Treatment.'--Little can be accomplished towards curing this disease\r\neither in the old or young dog, as the disease, in spite of all our\r\nefforts, will run its course, and terminate in total opacity of the\r\nlens. Mild purging, blistering on the neck, introduction of the seton,\r\nand blowing slightly stimulating powders into the eye, will sometimes\r\narrest the progress of the disease in the young dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERATIONS ON THE CORNEA\r\n\r\nare sometimes very troublesome, and if not put a stop to, will often\r\ncause opacity and blindness, if not total destruction of the eye.\r\n\r\nSlightly stimulating washes and purges are useful; the careful\r\napplication of nitrate of silver will often induce the ulcer to heal; it\r\nmust be put on very nicely and gently.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOTS ON THE CORNEA\r\n\r\nare the result of ulcers and inflammation. If they do not materially\r\ninterfere with vision, they had better be left alone.\r\n\r\nPowdered sugar and a small quantity of alum blown into the eye daily\r\nthrough a quill, we have seen used with much success.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMAUROSIS--GUTTA SERENA OR GLASS EYE,\r\n\r\nA partial or complete paralysis of the optic nerves of either side is\r\nnot a frequent disease. It usually comes on gradually, but sometimes may\r\nappear in the course of a few hours from the effects of wounds or\r\nconvulsions. When the paralysis is complete, total blindness of course\r\nensues. The intimate connection, or sympathy, existing between the\r\nnerves of either eye, is so peculiar that disease of one is quickly\r\nfollowed by a corresponding disease in the other.\r\n\r\nAmaurosis, therefore, ordinarily ends in total blindness. The disease is\r\ncharacterized by a dilated stage of the pupil, which seldom contracts\r\nunder the effect of any degree of light thrown upon it. The coats and\r\nhumours of the eye are perfectly transparent, in fact appear to be more\r\npellucid than natural.\r\n\r\n'Causes.'--This affection is produced in many different ways; among the\r\nmost common causes may be mentioned wounds on the head, or of the parts\r\nsurrounding the nerve, strains, falls, disease of the bone, convulsions,\r\nand epileptic fits.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a case produced by a tumour, which occupied the posterior\r\nportion of the orbit, and caused the organ to be somewhat protruded from\r\nits proper position, giving the eye the appearance of hydrophthalmia,\r\nfor which it was taken, the existence of the tumour never for a moment\r\nbeing suspected. In this case there was partial amaurosis in both sides,\r\nalthough nothing of disease could be discovered in the left eye.\r\n\r\nAmaurosis is a very deceptive disease, the nerves alone being affected;\r\nthe humours and coverings of the eye remaining perfectly transparent and\r\nnatural, imposes upon the inexperienced observer, but is easily detected\r\nby those who have witnessed the disease in others. There is a singular\r\nwatery appearance and vacant stare about the eye of the dog that cannot\r\nbe mistaken. This peculiarity is owing, no doubt, to the enlargement of\r\nthe pupil, as before observed.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--When proceeding from blows, convulsions, or inflammation\r\nof the nerve itself, bleeding will be serviceable, as also purging and\r\nblistering. If the disease should appear without any symptom, or other\r\ncause, to lead us to believe that there is any local affection, the\r\nantiphlogistic course should be laid aside, and resort be had to local\r\nand constitutional tonic applications, and revulsive frictions to the\r\nnape of the neck and spine. A seton may also be applied; and electricity\r\nhas been recommended in such cases, no doubt arising from want of tone\r\nin the general system.\r\n\r\nThis affection, in spite of every effort, is very unmanageable, and but\r\nseldom yields to any course of treatment. Strychnia has been used\r\nlately, both internally and externally, in the cure of this complaint;\r\nit may be sprinkled over a blistered surface immediately above the eye,\r\nin the proportion of a grain morning and evening; it may also be\r\nadministered inwardly at the same time, in doses from the half a grain\r\nto a grain twice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTIRPATION OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes becomes necessary, from the diseased state of this organ,\r\nthat it should be taken completely from its socket. This operation,\r\nthough frightful, perhaps, to consider, is very simple in its\r\napplication, and may be performed without difficulty by any one\r\naccustomed to the use of the knife. The animal is to be held firmly, as\r\nbefore directed, and an assistant to keep the lids widely extended.\r\n\r\nIf the lids cannot be drawn well over the eye, owing to enlargement of\r\nthe ball caused by disease, they may be separated by an incision at the\r\nexternal angle. A curved needle armed with a thread is now to be passed\r\nentirely through the eye, being careful to include sufficient of the\r\nsound parts within its grasp to prevent its tearing out. This finished,\r\nthe needle may be detached, and the ends of the thread being united, the\r\nmovements of the eye can be governed by means of this ligature: then\r\nproceed as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. The assistant keeping the lids well separated, the operator draws\r\nthe eye upward and outward, and then inserting the scalpel at the inner\r\nand lower angle of the eye, with a gentle sweep separates the ball from\r\nthe lids, extending the incisions through to the external canthus.\r\n\r\n2d. The ball is now to be drawn inwardly and downward, while the\r\nscalpel, continuing the circular movement as far as the internal\r\ncanthus, separates the upper lid.\r\n\r\n3d. The muscles and optic nerves still bind this organ to the orbit,\r\nwhich attachments can easily be destroyed by the scalpel, by pulling the\r\neye forward sufficiently to reach them. If the eye has been extirpated\r\non account of any malignant disease, it is necessary to remove every\r\nparticle of muscle from the orbit; and when the disease has extended\r\nitself to the lids, it will also be proper to remove that portion of\r\nthem included in the affection.\r\n\r\nThe hemorrhage from the operation is trifling, and may generally be\r\narrested by the pressure of the fingers, or the insertion of a conical\r\nball of lint within the socket, which may be allowed to remain two or\r\nthree days if necessary. If there is nothing to apprehend from\r\nhemorrhage, it is only necessary to draw the lids together, and unite\r\nthat portion which has been separated by a suture, and place a hood over\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nWe do not recommend the stuffing of the orbit with lint, except in case\r\nof hemorrhage, as its presence will sometimes produce violent\r\ninflammation, which may extend to the brain. The cavity of the eye will,\r\nin a measure, be filled up by newly formed matter. The dog must be\r\nrestricted to a low cooling diet, and have administered two or three\r\nsaline purges.\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERATIONS OF THE EYELIDS\r\n\r\nare often met with in old mangy, ill-fed animals, and are difficult to\r\novercome, except by curing the the primary affection, which is often no\r\neasy task. The lids become enlarged, puffy, and tender, the lashes fall\r\nout, and the edges present an angry reddish appearance.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'--Must be directed, in the first place, to the curing of the\r\nold affection, by which, in connection with blisters, purging,\r\nstimulating washes, &c., a cure may be effected. When the swelling of\r\nthe lids is considerable, scarifying them with the point of a lancet\r\nwill often be of much service. Ointment of nitrate of silver may also be\r\nsmeared on the edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTS ON THE EYELIDS\r\n\r\nsometimes make their appearance; they may be lifted up with the forceps,\r\nand excised with a knife or scissors, and the wound touched with nitrate\r\nof silver. The same treatment will answer for those warts, or little\r\nexcrescences, that sometimes come on the inside of the lids.\r\n\r\n\r\nENTROPIUM--INVERSION OF THE EYELIDS.\r\n\r\nThis disease we do not find mentioned by any of the writers on canine\r\npathology: nevertheless, we are led to believe that it is not an\r\nuncommon form of ophthalmia; and we must express our surprise that it\r\nshould have escaped the attention of such close observers as Blain and\r\nYouatt.\r\n\r\nThe acute form of the disease resulting from, or attending, simple\r\nophthalmia, we have often witnessed, but the chronic form, of which we\r\nmore particularly speak, is more rare. We have seen three cases of the\r\nlatter, and, no doubt, might have found many more if our opportunities\r\nof studying canine pathology were equal to those of the English writers.\r\nThe inversion of the eyelids upon the globe is accompanied with pain and\r\nirritation, swelling and inflammation, both of the lids and eye, which\r\nultimately renders the dog almost useless, if not entirely blind.\r\n\r\n'Causes'.--Neglected chronic ophthalmia was, no doubt, the cause of the\r\ndisease in two cases, a setter and a pointer, while the other, in a\r\nhound, was the result of an acute attack of ophthalmia brought on by\r\nscalding with hot pitch thrown upon the animal. Some of this substance\r\nentered the eye, while a large portion adhered to the muzzle and lids.\r\nThe eye, as well as the lids, became inflamed; the latter, being puffed\r\nup and contracted on their edges, were necessarily drawn inwards from\r\nthe tension of the parts, and double entropium was thus produced. The\r\ninflammation and tumefaction of the parts continued for a considerable\r\ntime, and when ultimately reduced by the application of tepid\r\nfomentations, the skin appeared greatly relaxed; and the muscular fibres\r\nhaving lost their power of support or contractility, owing to their long\r\nquiescence, seemed no longer able to keep their lids in their proper\r\nsituation; the edges therefore remained in the abnormous position\r\npreviously assumed.\r\n\r\nBy this strange condition of the parts, the eyeball continued greatly\r\nirritated by the constant friction of the lashes; water was continually\r\nflowing over the lids, and from its irritating character produced\r\nconsiderable excoriation of the face and muzzle. The conjunctiva\r\nremained inflamed, the cornea in due course became ulcerous, and the eye\r\nwas ultimately destroyed by the discharge of its contents. This was the\r\ncourse and final termination of the disease in the case of the hound\r\nabove referred to, all of which disastrous results might have been\r\nprevented by proper management.\r\n\r\n'Treatment.'--When in England, we sent to the United States a fine bred\r\npointer dog, designed as a present for one of our sporting friends. This\r\nanimal travelled from Leeds to Liverpool, chained on top of the railroad\r\ncars; the journey occupied several hours, daring which the weather was\r\ncold and boisterous, and we noticed on his arrival at the latter place\r\nthat his eyes were watering and somewhat inflamed. On examining them\r\nmore particularly, we were enabled to extract several pieces of cinder\r\nfrom under the lids, which seemed to relieve him somewhat. He went to\r\nsea, in the care of the steward, on the following day; and remained on\r\ndeck exposed to the inclemency of the weather during a long voyage. When\r\nhe arrived in Philadelphia, the inflammation, we were informed, was very\r\nconsiderable, occasioned by the presence of some other small particles\r\nof cinder that may have escaped our attention before shipping him. The\r\npresence of these foreign substances in the eye, in connection with the\r\nsalt spray and irritating atmosphere, greatly aggravated the ophthalmia,\r\nand resolved it into a chronic affection, which ultimately resulted in\r\nentropium.\r\n\r\n\"Fop\" was hunted during the same autumn, which no doubt increased the\r\nmalady to a considerable extent; and before the hunting season was over,\r\nthe dog was rendered almost useless: the lids becoming so much swollen\r\nand the irritation so considerable, that it was deemed cruel to allow\r\nhim to go into the field.\r\n\r\nWhen we saw him some time in the course of the same winter, the lower\r\nlids of both eyes were completely inverted on their globes, and the\r\nconjunctival inflammation and flow of tears considerable.\r\n\r\nThe eyes seemed contracted within their sockets, and at times were\r\nnearly hidden from view, the corneas were somewhat opaque, the\r\nphotophobia intolerable, and the animal showed evident signs of extreme\r\npain, by his restless anxiety and constant efforts at scratching and\r\nrubbing the eyes.\r\n\r\nUnder the judicious application of cooling astringent collyria, and\r\nother remediate means, the irritation and pain of the parts were\r\nrelieved, and the lids somewhat retracted.\r\n\r\n\"Fop\" remained in this condition till the following autumn, suffering at\r\ntimes considerably from the increased inflammation and tumefaction of\r\nthe lids, which continued obstinately to persist, insomuch that when\r\nturned out by the pressure of the fingers on them, they immediately\r\ncontracted, and were forced inwards on the ball when freed from the\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nFinding that no external application was of any permanent benefit, we\r\nresolved to have resort to the same operation we saw practised in the\r\nParisian hospitals for the cure of a similar malformation in the human\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nTo insure quiet we enclosed the body of the dog in a case, made\r\nstationary and sufficiently small to prevent struggling, with the head\r\nfirmly fixed by a sliding door, as represented in the accompanying\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nThe mouth was kept closed by a small strap passed around the muzzle.\r\nThis method of fixing a strong dog, we consider the best ever adopted\r\nfor all nice operations on the face. The first step in the operation was\r\nto pinch up a portion of the lax skin of the diseased lid and pass three\r\nneedles, armed with silk ligatures, successively through the base of the\r\nupraised integuments.\r\n\r\nOne needle approximating the external canthus, another the internal, and\r\na third midway between these two points, as represented in the annexed\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nThe next step was lo raise up the integuments included in the ligature,\r\nand, by means of a pair of sharp scissors, cut off the super-abundant\r\nskin as near to the ligatures as possible; having care however to leave\r\nsufficient substance included in the ligatures, to prevent their\r\nsloughing out before adhesion has taken place. The next and last step of\r\nthe operation was, to draw the edges of the wound together by tying each\r\nligature, which procedure immediately secured the lid and held it firmly\r\nin its natural position. The ligatures were now cut short, and a large\r\nwire muzzle, covered over with some dark substance on the operated eye,\r\nbeing put on him, and his legs hobbled with a piece of strong twine,\r\nmore effectually to prevent his scratching the head, \"Fop\" was then set\r\nat liberty, and soon became reconciled to this eye-shade.\r\n\r\nThe hemorrhage was trifling, the wound healed up by the first intention\r\nand the ligatures were drawn away in a few days, when a perfect cure was\r\neffected--the conjunctiva having lost its inflammatory appearance, and\r\nthe cornea having again become quite transparent.\r\n\r\nThe other eye was operated on in the same way and with like success. In\r\nthe first operation we cut away the loose flaccid integuments only;\r\nwhereas, in the second, we snipped small longitudinal fibres from the\r\ncartilage itself, and the operation consequently was more perfect, if\r\npossible, than in the first instance.\r\n\r\nThe eyes were now perfectly restored, and remained well during the whole\r\nof the shooting season, after which we lost sight of our patient, he\r\nhaving accompanied one of our friends as a \"compagnon de voyage\" on a\r\ncommercial expedition to Santa Fe, and, when on his return, had the\r\nmisfortune to lose \"Fop,\" who was carried off into captivity by some\r\nprowling Camanches, who no doubt have long since sacrificed him to the\r\nGreat Spirit in celebrating the buffalo or wolf dance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTRUSION OF THE EYE\r\n\r\nThe eye may be forced from its orbit by wounds or the bites of other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIf not materially injured, the ball should be cleaned with a little\r\ntepid water, or by wiping off with a fine silk or cambric handkerchief,\r\nand immediately replaced within its socket; otherwise the inflammation\r\nand swelling of the lids will soon prevent its easy admission. When\r\nhandling the protruded eye, the fingers should be dipped in olive oil or\r\nwarm water.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficient time has elapsed from the occurrence of the accident to\r\nprevent the ball being replaced, owing to the swelling and contraction\r\nof the lids, an incision may be made at the external angle of the eye,\r\nso as to divide the lids, which will then admit the eye into its natural\r\nposition. If not, the lid itself can be raised up and slit far enough to\r\nallow its being drawn over the globe. As considerable inflammation\r\ngenerally follows this accident, it will be prudent to bleed the animal\r\nand confine him.\r\n\r\nWe have seen eyes replaced, that have been out of their sockets for\r\nseveral hours, perfectly recover their strength and brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAK EYES.\r\n\r\nSome dogs, particularly several breeds of spaniels, have naturally weak\r\neyes, attended by an over-secretion and constant flow of tears, more\r\nparticularly when exposed to the sun. When there is no disease of the\r\nlachrymal duct, the secretion may be diminished and the eyes\r\nstrengthened by the daily application of some slightly tonic wash, as\r\nNo. 1, 2, 3, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISTULA LACHRYMALIS.\r\n\r\nThe lachrymal duct is a small canal, leading from the internal angle of\r\nthe eye to the nostrils, and is the passage through which the tears\r\nescape from the eye. This duct may become closed by inflammation of the\r\nlining membrane of the nose, caries of the bone, ulcers, fungous\r\ngrowths, or by the presence of some extraneous substance impacted in it.\r\nThe tears, no longer having a natural outlet, are necessarily forced\r\nover the lids, accompanied, not unfrequently, by a good deal of purulent\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThis canal, when thus obstructed from some one of the above causes,\r\noften forms an ulcerous opening at its upper extremity, just below the\r\ninternal canthus, for the escape of the pus that usually collects in a\r\nsac at that point. This perforation is called \"Fistula Lachrymalis.\" The\r\ntears, entering the canal at its punctum, are carried along till they\r\npass out at the fistulous opening.\r\n\r\nTreatment'.--This is a very troublesome affection, and has been\r\npronounced incurable by some writers. However, we would not hesitate\r\nmaking an attempt at relieving a favourite or valuable dog of this\r\ndisagreeable deformity. We should first endeavour to clear out the nasal\r\ncanal, either by means of a minute flexible probe, or by directing a\r\nstream of water from a suitable syringe through its course. A small\r\nsilver or copper style may then be placed in the canal to keep it open,\r\nas also to direct the tears through the natural route. This being done,\r\nand the dog confined in such a way as not to be able to scratch or rub\r\nthe eye, the fistulous opening might close up in a short time. However,\r\nit might be necessary to wear the style for many months. In such a case,\r\nwe see no reason why a wire muzzle, such as used by us after the\r\noperation for Entropium, might not be worn for an indefinite period,\r\nwithout any inconvenience to the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARUNCULA LACHRYMALIS AND PLICA SEMILUNARIS, OR HAW.\r\n\r\nThe caruncula lachrymalis is a small glandular body situated at the\r\ninternal commissure of each eye. This little gland often becomes greatly\r\nenlarged from inflammation or fungous growths--old dogs are much more\r\nsubject to the disease than young ones.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--The application of cooling collyria and a weak solution of\r\nnitrate of silver, will generally suppress the further growth of this\r\ngland. If, however, it continues much swollen and runs on to\r\nsuppuration, it may be punctured with a lancet and poultices applied. If\r\nthe affection be of a malignant character, the gland may be drawn out by\r\npassing a ligature through its base, and then excised.\r\n\r\nThe haw is most frequently concerned in the disease, and may also be\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCollyria:\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx] Vinegar                             [Symbol: ounce]   i.\r\n             Laudanum                            [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n             Water                               [Symbol: ounce] vii.\r\n\r\nMix.--The eyes to be frequently bathed with the mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 2.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Sulphate of zinc (white vitriol)   [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n              Water                              [Symbol: ounce]  vi.\r\n\r\nM.--To be used as above.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Sulphate of copper (blue vitriol)   [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n              Water                               [Symbol: ounce]  vi.\r\n\r\nM.--To be used as above.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 4.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Acetate of lead (sugar of lead)     [Symbol: scruple] ii.\r\n              Water                               [Symbol: ounce]   vi.\r\n\r\nM.--To be used as above.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 5.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Argenti nitrat.

When the whole of the body, except the\r\nhead and ears, is surrounded by cold water, there will be an unusual\r\ndetermination of blood to those parts, and consequent distension of the\r\nvessels and a predisposition to inflammation. A Newfoundland dog, or\r\nsetter, or poodle, that has been subject to canker, is often freed from\r\na return of the disease by being kept from the water.\r\n\r\nThe earliest symptom of the approach of canker is frequent shaking of\r\nthe head, or holding of the head on one side, or violent scratching of\r\none or both ears. Redness of the integument may then be observed, and\r\nparticularly of that portion of it which lines the annular cartilage.\r\nThis is usually accompanied by some enlargement of the folds of the\r\nskin. As soon as any of these symptoms are observed, the ear should be\r\ngently but well washed, two or three times in the day, with lukewarm\r\nwater, and after that a weak solution of the extract of lead should be\r\napplied, and a dose or two of physic administered.\r\n\r\nIf the case is neglected, the pain will rapidly increase; the ear will\r\nbecome of an intenser red; the folds of the integument will enlarge, and\r\nthere will be a deposition of red or black matter in the hollow of the\r\near. The case is now more serious, and should be immediately attended\r\nto. This black or bloody deposit should be gently but carefully washed\r\naway with warm water and soap; and the extract of lead, in the\r\nproportion of a scruple to an ounce of water, should be frequently\r\napplied, until the redness and heat are abated. A solution of alum, in\r\nabout the same quantity of alum and water as the foregoing lotion,\r\nshould then be used.\r\n\r\nSome attention should be paid to the method of applying these lotions.\r\nTwo persons will be required in order to accomplish the operation. The\r\nsurgeon must hold the muzzle of the dog with one hand, and have the root\r\nof the ear in the hollow of the other, and between the first finger and\r\nthe thumb. The assistant must then pour the liquid into the ear; half a\r\ntea-spoonful will usually be sufficient. The surgeon, without quitting\r\nthe dog, will then close the ear, and mould it gently until the liquid\r\nhas insinuated itself as deeply as possible into the passages of the\r\near. Should not the inflammation abate in the course of a few days, a\r\nseton should be inserted in the poll, between the integument and the\r\nmuscles of the occiput, reaching from ear to ear. The excitement of a\r\nnew inflammation, so near to the part previously diseased, will\r\nmaterially abate the original affection. Physic is now indispensable.\r\nFrom half a drachm to a drachm of aloes, with from one to two grains of\r\ncalomel, should be given every third day.\r\n\r\nShould the complaint have been much neglected, or the inflammation so\r\ngreat as to bid defiance to these means, ulceration will too often\r\nspeedily follow. It will be found lodged deep in the passage, and can\r\nonly be detected by moulding the ear; the effused pus will occasionally\r\noccupy the inside of the ear to its very tip. However extensive and\r\nannoying the inflammation may be, and occasionally causing so much\r\nthickening of the integument as perfectly to close the ear, it is always\r\nsuperficial. It will generally yield to proper treatment, and the\r\ncartilage of the ear may not be in the slightest degree affected. Still,\r\nhowever, the animal may suffer extreme pain; the discharge from the\r\nulcer may produce extensive excoriation of the cheek; and, in a few\r\ncases, the system may sympathise with the excessive local application,\r\nand the animal may be lost.\r\n\r\nThe treatment must vary with circumstances. If the ulceration is deep in\r\nthe ear, and there is not a very great degree of apparent inflammation,\r\nrecourse may be had at once to a stimulating and astringent application,\r\nsuch as alum or the sulphate of zinc, and in the proportion of six\r\ngrains of either to an ounce of water. If, however, the ulceration\r\noccupies the greater part of the hollow of the ear, and is accompanied\r\nby much thickening of the integument, and apparent filling up of the\r\nentrance to the ear, some portion of the inflammation must be first\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nThe only chance of getting rid of the disease is to confine the ear. A\r\npiece of strong calico must be procured, six or eight inches in width,\r\nand sufficiently long to reach round the head and meet under the jaw.\r\nAlong each side of it must be a running piece of tape, and a shorter\r\npiece sewed at the centre of each of the ends. By means of these the cap\r\nmay be drawn tightly over the head, above the eyes, and likewise round\r\nthe neck behind the ears, so as perfectly to confine them.\r\n\r\nAfter all, no mild ointment will dispose such an ulcer to heal, and\r\nrecourse must be had at once to a caustic application. A scruple of the\r\nnitrate of silver must be rubbed down with an ounce of lard, and a\r\nlittle of it applied twice every day, and rubbed tolerably hard into the\r\nsore until it assumes a healthy appearance; it may then be dressed with\r\nthe common calamine ointment.\r\n\r\nIf the discharge should return, the practitioner must again have\r\nrecourse to the caustic ointment.\r\n\r\nThe cartilage will never close, but the integument will gradually cover\r\nthe exposed edges, and the wound will be healed. The ear will, however,\r\nlong continue tender, and, if it should be much beaten, by the shaking\r\nof the head, the ulcer will reappear. This must be obviated by\r\noccasionally confining the ears, and not overfeeding the dog.\r\n\r\nSome sportsmen are accustomed to 'round' the ears, that is to cut off\r\nthe diseased part. In very few instances, however, will a permanent cure\r\nbe effected, while the dog is often sadly disfigured. A fresh ulcer\r\nfrequently appears on the new edge, and is more difficult to heal than\r\nthe original one. Nine times out of ten the disease reappears.\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland dog is very subject to this disease, to remedy which\r\nrecourse must be had to the nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\nSpaniels have often a mangy inflammation of the edges of the ear. It\r\nseldom runs on to canker; but the hair comes off round the edges of the\r\near, accompanied by much heat and scurfiness of the skin. The common\r\nsulphur ointment, with an eighth part of mercurial ointment, will\r\nusually remove the disease.\r\n\r\nFrom the irritation produced by canker in or on the ear, and the\r\nconstant flapping and beating of the ear, there is sometimes a\r\nconsiderable effusion of fluid between the integument and the cartilage\r\noccupying the whole of the inside of the flap of the ear. The only\r\nremedy is to open the enlarged part from end to end, carefully to take\r\nout the gossamer lining of the cyst, and then to insert some bits of\r\nlint on each side of the incision, in order to prevent its closing too\r\nsoon. In a few days, the parietes of the cyst will begin to adhere, and\r\na perfect cure will be accomplished\r\n\r\nIf the tumour is simply punctured, the incision will speedily close, and\r\nthe cyst will fill again in the space of four-and-twenty hours. A seton\r\nmay be used, but it is more painful to the dog, and slower in its\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe ear should be frequently fomented with a decoction of white poppies,\r\nand to this should follow the Goulard lotion; and, after that, if\r\nnecessary, a solution of alum should be applied. To the soreness or\r\nscabby eruption, which extends higher up the ear, olive oil or\r\nspermaceti ointment may be applied. In some cases, portions of the\r\nthickened skin, projecting and excoriated, and pressing on each other,\r\nunite, and the opening into the ear is then mechanically filled. I know\r\nnot of any remedy for this. It is useless to perforate the adventitious\r\nsubstance, for the orifice will soon close; and, more than once, when I\r\nhave made a crucial incision, and cut out the unnatural mass that closed\r\nthe passage, I have found it impossible to keep down the fungous\r\ngranulations or to prevent total deafness.\r\n\r\nThe following is a singular case of this disease:--1st July, 1820 a dog\r\nwas sent with a tumour, evidently containing a fluid, in the flap of the\r\near. A seton had been introduced, but had been sadly neglected. The hair\r\nhad become matted round the seton, and the discharge had thus been\r\nstopped. Inflammation and considerable pain had evidently followed, and\r\nthe dog had nearly torn the seton out. I removed it, washed the ear\r\nwell, and applied the tincture of myrrh and aloes. The wound soon\r\nhealed. On the 14th the ear began again to fill. On the 17th the tumour\r\nwas ripe for the seton, which was again introduced, and worn until the\r\n9th of August, when the sides of the abscess appeared again to have\r\nadhered, and it was withdrawn. Canker had continued in the ear during\r\nthe whole time; and, in defiance of a cold lotion daily applied, the ear\r\nwas perceived again to be disposed to fill. The seton was once more\r\ninserted, and the cyst apparently closed. The seton was continued a\r\nfortnight after the sinus was obliterated, and then removed. Six weeks\r\nafterwards the swelling had disappeared, and the canker was quite\r\nremoved. This anecdote is an encouragement to persevere under the most\r\ndisheartening circumstances.\r\n\r\nAll dogs that are foolishly suffered to become gross and fat are subject\r\nto canker. It seems to be a natural outlet for excess of nutriment or\r\ngross humour; and, when a dog has once laboured under the disease, he is\r\nvery subject to a return of it. The fatal power of habit is in few cases\r\nmore evident than in this disease. When a dog has symptoms of mange, the\r\nredness or eruption of the skin, generally, will not unfrequently\r\ndisappear, and bad canker speedily follow. The habit, however, may be\r\nsubdued, or at least may be kept at bay, by physic and the use of\r\nGoulard lotion or alum.\r\n\r\nSportsmen are often annoyed by another species of canker Pointers and\r\nhounds are particularly subject to it.\r\n\r\nThis species of canker commences with a scurfy eruption and thickening\r\nof the edges of the ear, apparently attended by considerable itching or\r\npain. The dog is continually flapping his ear, and beating it violently\r\nagainst his head. The inflammation is thus increased, and the tip of the\r\near becomes exceedingly sore. This causes him to shake his head still\r\nmore violently, and the ulcer spreads and is indisposed to heal, and at\r\nlength a fissure or crack appears on the tip of the cartilage, and\r\nextends to a greater or less distance down the ear.\r\n\r\nThe narration of one or two cases may be useful, as showing the\r\ninveteracy of the disease.\r\n\r\n8th Feb. 1832.--A Newfoundland dog, very fat, had dreadful canker in\r\nboth ears, and considerable discharge of purulent matter. He was\r\ncontinually shaking his ears, lying and moaning. Apply the canker\r\nlotion, and give the alterative balls.\r\n\r\n13th. The discharge considerably lessened from one ear, but that from\r\nthe other has increased. Continue the lotion and apply a seton.\r\n\r\n22d. The dog, probably neglected at home, was sent to me. Both ears\r\nwere as bad as ever.\r\n\r\n25th. The dog is perfectly unmanageable when the lotion is poured into\r\nthe ear, but submits when an ointment is applied. Use ung. sambuci,\r\n[Symbol: ounce] j. cerus, acet. [Symbol: ounce] j., mix well together.\r\nContinue the alteratives.\r\n\r\n30th. Slowly amending; the whining has ceased, and the animal seldom\r\nscratches. Continue the lotion, alteratives, and purgatives.\r\n\r\n10th Oct.--Slowly improving. Continue the treatment.\r\n\r\n17th. One ear well, the other nearly so.\r\n\r\n24th. Both ears were apparently well.  Omit the lotion.\r\n\r\n28th. One ear was again ulcerated. Applied the aerugo aeris.\r\n\r\n31st. This has been too stimulating, and the ulceration is almost as\r\ngreat as at first. Return to the ung. sambuci and cerusa acetata.\r\n\r\nFrom this time to the 24th February, 1833, we continued occasionally\r\ntaking out the seton, but returning to it every two or three days;\r\napplying the canker lotion until we were driven from it, mixing with it\r\nvariable quantities of tinctura opii, having recourse to mercurial\r\nointment, and trying a solution of the sulphate of copper. With two or\r\nthree applications we could keep the disease at bay; but with none could\r\nwe fairly remove the evil. The sulphate of zinc, the acetate of lead,\r\ndecoctions of oak bark, a very mild injection of the nitrate of\r\nsilver,--all would do good at times; but at other times we were set at\r\ncomplete defiance.\r\n\r\nAnother gentleman brought his dog about the same time. This was also a\r\nNewfoundland dog. He had always been subject to mangy eruptions, and had\r\nnow mange in the feet, the inside of the ear covered with scaly\r\neruptions, the skin red underneath, considerable thickening of the ear,\r\nand a slight discharge from its base. A seton was inserted and a\r\nphysic-ball given every second day. The canker lotion had little good\r\neffect. Some calamine ointment, with a small portion of calomel, was\r\nthen had recourse to.\r\n\r\nIn ten days the dog had ceased to scratch himself or shake his head, and\r\nthe ear was clean and cool. The seton was removed; but the animal being\r\nconfined, a little redness again appeared in the ear, which the lotion\r\nsoon removed.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of a month he was dismissed apparently cured; but he\r\nafterwards had a return of his old mangy complaints, which bade defiance\r\nto every mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nHerr Maassen, V. S., Wümemburg, has lately introduced, and with much\r\nsuccess, the use of creosote for the cure of canker in the ear.\r\n\r\nThe first experiment was on a setter with canker in his ear. The owner\r\nof the dog had ordered it to be hanged, as all remedies had failed in\r\nproducing a cure. Herr Maassen prescribed creosoti 3ss. et spirit, vini\r\nrectificat. 3ij. This mixture was applied once in every day to the\r\ndiseased part. In a few weeks the dog was completely cured, and has\r\nsince had no return of the complaint. In a terrier, and also in three\r\nspaniels, the effect of this application was equally satisfactory. In\r\nsome cases, where the disease showed itself in a less degree, the\r\ncreosote was dissolved in water, instead of spirit of wine. It is always\r\nnecessary to take away the collar while the dog is under treatment, in\r\norder that the flap of the ear may not be injured by striking against it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETATING EXCRESCENCES IN THE EAR. (By F. J. J. Rigot.)\r\n\r\nProductions of this kind, which he had the opportunity of observing only\r\nonce, are sometimes united in masses, and completely close the auditive\r\ncanal. The surface is granulated and black, and there escapes from it an\r\nunctuous fetid discharge. On both sides the animal is exceedingly\r\nsusceptible of pain, and the excrescences bleed if the slightest\r\npressure is brought to bear upon them.\r\n\r\nHe thought it right to cut away these excrescences bodily, which he\r\nfound to be composed of a strong dense tissue, permitting much blood to\r\nescape through an innumerable quantity of vascular openings. They were\r\nreproduced with extreme promptitude after they had been cut off or\r\ncauterized. Some of them appeared no more after being destroyed by the\r\nnitrate of mercury.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, twenty-four hours after a simple incision, not\r\nfollowed by cauterization, these productions acquire an almost\r\nincredible size. It seemed, in M. Rigot's case, to be impossible to\r\nconquer the evil, and the patient was destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nERUPTIONS IN THE EAR.\r\n\r\nA Newfoundland dog had long been subject to mangy eruptions on the back\r\nand in the feet. They had suddenly disappeared, and the whole of the\r\ninside of the ear became covered with scaly eruptions. The skin was red;\r\nthere was considerable thickening of the ear, and a discharge from the\r\nbase of it. The canker-lotion was used, a physic-ball given every second\r\nday, and a seton inserted in the poll reaching from ear to ear. No\r\napparent benefit resulted. A little calamine ointment, to which was\r\nadded one-eighth part of mercurial ointment, was then tried, and\r\nconsiderable benefit immediately experienced. The dog no longer\r\ncontinued to scratch himself or to shake his head, and the ear became\r\nclean and cool. The seton was removed, and nothing remained but a little\r\noccasional redness, which the lotion very soon dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe owner, however, became ultimately tired of all this doctoring, and\r\nthe animal was destroyed.\r\n\r\nA poodle had had exceedingly bad ears during several months. There was\r\nconsiderable discharge, apparently giving much pain. The dog was\r\ncontinually shaking his head and crying.  A seton was introduced, the\r\ncanker-lotion was resorted to, and alterative and purgative medicines\r\nexhibited. On the 29th of December the discharge from the ear ceased;\r\nbut, owing to the neglect of the servant, it soon broke out again, and\r\nthere was not only much excoriation under the ear, but, from the matting\r\nof the hair, deep ulcers formed on either side, the edges of the wound\r\nwere ragged, and the skin was detached from the muscular parts beneath.\r\nProbes were introduced on each side, which passed down the neck and\r\nnearly met. The smell was intolerably offensive, and the dog was reduced\r\nalmost to a skeleton. I was, for the second time, sent for to see the\r\ncase. I immediately recommended that the animal should be destroyed; but\r\nthis was not permitted. I then ordered that it should daily be carefully\r\nwashed, and diluted tincture of myrrh be applied to the wounds. They\r\nshowed no disposition to heal, and the dog gradually sunk under the\r\ncontinued discharge and died.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLENT AFFECTION OF THE EAR.\r\n\r\n20th May, 1928.--A spaniel screamed violently, even when it was not\r\ntouched, and held its head permanently on one side, as if the muscles\r\nwere contracted. The glands beneath the ear were enlarged, but the\r\nbowels were regular; the nose was not hot; there was no cough. A warm\r\nbath was ordered, with aperient medicine.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d she was no better. I examined the case more carefully. The\r\nleft ear was exceedingly hot and tender: she would scarcely bear me to\r\ntouch it. I continued the aperient medicine, and ordered a warm lotion\r\nto be applied, consisting of the liquor plumbi acetatis and infusion of\r\ndigitalis. She improved from the first application of it, and in a few\r\ndays was quite well. A fortnight afterwards the pain returned. The\r\nlotion was employed, but not with the same success. A seton was then\r\napplied. She wore it only four days, when the pain completely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nI have an account in my records of the conduct of a coward, who, coming\r\nfrom such a breed, was not worthy of the trouble we took with him. He\r\nwas a Newfoundland dog, two years old, with considerable enlargement,\r\nredness, and some discharge from both ears. He was sent to our hospital\r\nfor treatment. When no one was near him, he shook his head and scratched\r\nhis ears, and howled dreadfully. Many times in the course of the day he\r\ncried as if we were murdering him. We sent him home thoroughly well, and\r\nglad we were to get rid of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROPPING OF THE EARS.\r\n\r\nI had some doubt, whether I ought not to omit the mention of this cruel\r\npractice. Mr. Blaine very properly says, that\r\n\r\n  \"it is one that does not honour the inventor, for nature gives nothing\r\n  in vain. Beauty and utility appear in all when properly examined, but\r\n  in unequal degrees. In some, beauty is pre-eminent; while, in others,\r\n  utility appears to have been the principal consideration. That must,\r\n  therefore, be a false taste, that has taught us to prefer a\r\n  'curtailed' organ to a perfect one, without gaining any convenience by\r\n  the operation.\" He adds, and it is my only excuse saying one word\r\n  about the matter, that \"custom being now fixed, directions are proper\r\n  for its performance.\"\r\n\r\nThe owner of the dog commences with maiming him while a puppy. He finds\r\nfault with the ears that nature has given him, and they are rounded or\r\ncut into various shapes, according to his whim or caprice. It is a cruel\r\noperation. A great deal of pain is inflicted by it, and it is often a\r\nlong time before the edge of the wound will heal: a fortnight or three\r\nweeks at least will elapse ere the animal is free from pain.\r\n\r\nIt has been pleaded, and I would be one of the last to oppose the plea,\r\nthat the ears of many dogs are rounded on account of the ulcers which\r\nattack and rend the conch; because animals with short ears defend\r\nthemselves most readily from the attacks of others: because, in their\r\ncombats with each other, they generally endeavour to lay hold of the\r\nneck or the ears; and, therefore, when their ears are shortened, they\r\nhave considerable advantage over their adversary. There is some truth in\r\nthis plea; but, otherwise, the operation of cropping is dependent on\r\ncaprice or fashion.\r\n\r\nIf the ears of dogs must be cropped, it should not be done too early.\r\nFour, five, or six weeks should first pass; otherwise, they will grow\r\nagain, and the second cropping will not produce a good appearance. The\r\nscissors are the proper instruments for accomplishing the removal of the\r\near; the tearing of the cartilages out by main force is an act of\r\ncruelty that none but a brute in human shape would practise; and, if he\r\nattempts it, it is ten to one that he does not obtain a good crop. If\r\nthe conch is torn out, there is nothing remaining to retain the skin\r\nround the auricular opening: it may be torn within the auditory canal,\r\nand as that is otherwise very extensible in the dog, it is prolonged\r\nabove the opening, which may then probably be closed by a cicatrix. The\r\nanimal will in this case always remain deaf, at least in one ear. In the\r\nmean time, the mucous membrane that lines the 'meatus auditorias'\r\nsubsists, the secretion of the wax continues; it accumulates and\r\nacquires an irritating quality; the irritation which it causes produces\r\nan augmentation of the secretion, and soon the whole of the subcutaneous\r\npassage becomes filled, and seems to assume the form of a cord; and it\r\nfinishes by the dog continuing to worry himself, shaking his head, and\r\nbecoming subject to fits.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine very naturally observes, that, \"it is not a little surprising\r\nthat this cruel custom is so frequently, or almost invariably, practised\r\non pug-dogs, whose ears, if left alone to nature, are particularly\r\nhandsome and hang very gracefully. It is hardly to be conceived how the\r\npug's head--which is not naturally beautiful except in the eye of\r\nperverted taste--is improved by suffering his ears to remain.\"\r\n\r\nIf the cropping is to be practised, the mother should have been\r\npreviously removed. It is quite erroneous, that her licking the wounded\r\nedges will be serviceable. On the contrary, it only increases their\r\npain, and deprives the young ones of the best balsam that can be\r\napplied--the blood that flows from their wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYPI IN THE EARS.\r\n\r\nDr. Mercer, in The Veterinarian, of July, 1844, gives an interesting\r\naccount of the production of polypi in the meatus of the ear. He\r\nconsiders that there are two kinds of polypi--first, the soft, vascular\r\nand bleeding polypus, usually produced from the fibro-cartilaginous\r\nstructure of the outer half of the tube; and, secondly, the hard and\r\ncartilaginous polypus or excrescence produced from the lining membrane\r\nof its inner half. The first is termed the hæmatoid polypus, and the\r\nother the chondromatous. The dog suffering under either generally has a\r\ndull, heavy, and rather watery eye. He moans or whines at intervals. If\r\nhis master is present he feels a relief in pressing and rubbing his\r\naching ear against him. At other times he presses and rubs his ear\r\nagainst the ground, in order to obtain a slight relief, flapping his\r\nears and shaking his head; the mouth being opened and the tongue\r\nprotruded, and the affected ear pointing to the ground. Then comes a\r\nsudden, and often a profuse, discharge of fetid pus. The local discharge\r\nof pus and blood becomes daily more and more fetid, and the poor animal\r\nbecomes an object of disgust.\r\n\r\nIn the first variety of polypus, where it is practicable, the soft and\r\nvascular excrescence should be excised with a pair of scissors or a\r\nsmall knife, or it may be noosed by a ligature of silk or of silver\r\nwire, or twisted off with a pair of forceps. Immediately after its\r\nremoval, the base of the tumour should be carefully destroyed by the\r\nnitrate of silver, and this should be repeated as long as there is any\r\nappearance of renewed growth. Any ulcer or carious condition of the\r\nmeatus should be immediately removed.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the diseased parts, a soft cap should be used, and\r\nwithin the ear a little cotton wadding may defend the ear from injury.\r\n\r\nDr. Mercer very properly remarks that, in the second or chondromatous\r\nvariety of polypus of the meatus, the treatment must depend upon the\r\nconcomitant circumstances. If the tumour is seated close to the membrana\r\ntympani, and has a broad and sessile base, then it cannot be excised or\r\nnoosed with any degree of success. It must therefore be treated by the\r\ndaily application of the solid nitrate of silver, applied exactly to its\r\nsurface; and, in the intervals of application, the use of any collyria\r\nmay be had recourse to. If the substance of the growth be firm and\r\nsolid, and possess little sensibility, then a very speedy mode of\r\ngetting rid of it is to divide its substance with a small knife; and\r\nafterwards, by applying the solid nitrate of silver, the tumour will\r\nsoon be sloughed away.\r\n\r\nThe dog is liable to polypi in the nasal cavity, in the anus, and in the\r\nvagina, which it will not be out of place to mention here.\r\n\r\nThe polypi of the nasal and of the anal cavities often show themselves\r\nunder the form of rounded bodies, projecting from the nose or anus.\r\nTheir size and consistence are variable--sometimes soft, tearing with\r\nthe greatest facility, and bleeding at the slightest touch; at other\r\ntimes, solid and covered with pituitary membrane. They are generally the\r\nresult of ulcerations, wounds, fractures, perforations of the turbinated\r\nbones, sinuses,&c. These polypous productions obstruct the passage of\r\nthe air, and more or less impede the breathing. They are best extirpated\r\nby means of a ligature, or circular compression, on the pedicle of the\r\npolypus, and tightened every second day.\r\n\r\nWe may discover the presence of a tumour of this nature in one of the\r\nnasal passages, when, on putting our hand to the orifice of the nostril,\r\nthere issues little or no air; or when we sound the nostril with the\r\nfinger or a probe, or examine it on a bright day.\r\n\r\nThe methods of destroying polypi in the nasal cavity vary with the\r\ntexture, size, form, and position of these excrescences. Excision with\r\nthe bistoury, or with scissors, may be tried when the polypus is near\r\nthe orifice of the nostril, and particularly when it is not large at the\r\nbase. Excision should be followed by cauterization with the red-hot\r\niron, by which a portion of the base of the tumour is destroyed, and\r\nwhich could not be reached by a sharp instrument. To succeed in these\r\noperations, it is frequently necessary to cut through the false nostril.\r\nThe edges of the wound may afterwards be united by a suture.\r\n\r\nThe ligature, or circular compression, excised immediately on the\r\npedicle of the polypus, by means of a wire or waxed string, and directed\r\ninto the nasal cavity by means of a proper instrument, may he tried when\r\nthe polypus is deeply situated, and particularly when its base is\r\nnarrow. But, for this operation, which is difficult to perform, and\r\nwhich may be followed by a new polypous production, when the base is not\r\nperfectly destroyed, we may substitute the forcible detachment,\r\nespecially when we have to act on vascular and soft excrescences.\r\n\r\nThe Italian greyhound is strangely subject to these polypi in the matrix\r\nor vagina. The reason for it is difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nA bitch, ten years old, was brought to the author on the 20th December,\r\n1843, with an oval substance, as large as a thrush's egg, occasionally\r\nprotruding from the vagina. I advised that it should be removed by means\r\nof a ligature; but the owner was afraid, and a fortnight was suffered to\r\npass before she was brought again. The tumour had rapidly increased; it\r\nwas as large as a pigeon's egg, considerably excoriated, and the pedicle\r\nbeing almost as large as the tumour itself. The operation was now\r\nconsented to. I passed a ligature as firmly round the pedicle and as\r\nhigh up as I could. The bitch scarcely seemed to suffer any pain.\r\n\r\n3d Jan.--The circulation is evidently cut off, and the tumour is\r\nassuming a thoroughly black hue, but it appears to cause no\r\ninconvenience to the dog. I tightened the ligature. 4th. The tumour is\r\nnow completely black, considerably protruded, and apparently destitute\r\nof feeling. I again tightened the ligature.\r\n\r\n5th. The tumour not appearing disposed to separate, and the uterus\r\nseeming to be drawn back by its weight, I cut off the tumour close to\r\nthe ligature. Not the slightest pain seemed to be given, and the tumour\r\nwas hard and black. There was, however, a very little oozing of bloody\r\nfluid, which continuing to the 8th, I injected a slight solution of alum\r\ninto the vagina, and three days afterwards the discharge was perfectly\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n[Although our author has given us several interesting and practical\r\npages upon the diseases of the ear and its appendages, it seems to us\r\nthat the arrangement of the matter is rather objectionable, and not\r\nsufficiently explicit to be easily comprehended by sportsmen, not before\r\nfamiliar with the subject; we therefore add a concise resumé or epitome\r\nof these troublesome affections, which we trust will be found of\r\npractical utility to the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE OTORRHÆA,\r\n\r\nor running from the ear, produced by inflammation of the mucous membrane\r\nof the external auditory canal, is of frequent occurrence. The dog\r\nshould be purged with salts, and the ear washed with castile soap and\r\ntepid water. The following solution may be introduced several times a\r\nday:\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Sulphate of zinc      [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n              Water                 [Symbol: ounce]   i.\r\n      Mix.                            or,\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Sugar of lead         [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n              Water                 [Symbol: ounce]   i.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the discharge be fetid, the following may be applied often:\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Chloride of lime      [Symbol: drachm]   i.\r\n              Water                               1 pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affection in old dogs is very troublesome, and in most cases\r\nimpossible to cure. Alum, zinc, copper, lead, and other astringent\r\napplications may be used in powder, as a local application in these\r\ncases. A seton and blisters will also be serviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE FLAP.\r\n\r\nA tumour, particularly in old dogs, is often seen extending from the tip\r\nof the flap even to the base of the ear. It progresses slowly but\r\nsurely, if not interfered with in its career, and will become eventually\r\nenormously large and very painful. These tumours are most common in old\r\nsetters, Newfoundlands, and hounds.\r\n\r\nTreatment'.--The tumour, at its commencement, may be discussed by the\r\napplication of astringent washes, as warm vinegar, water, and laudanum,\r\nor sugar of lead. When, however, it has become more extensive, the only\r\nremedy is opening it through its whole extent, and pressing out its\r\npurulent content. A poultice may then be applied, and tepid fomentations\r\nused for several days. It is often extremely difficult to heal up the\r\nabscess, or arrest the fetid discharge that is constantly collecting: a\r\nseton placed in the poll, in connexion with washes of a stimulating\r\ncharacter, will, however, effect a cure, if patiently persevered in.\r\nEither of the following will answer this purpose:\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]    Chloride of lime    [Symbol: drachm] i.\r\n                Water               [Symbol: ounce] vi.\r\n      Mix.                            or,\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Sulphate of zinc            [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n              Water                       [Symbol: ounce] jii.\r\n    Mix.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe used on one occasion tincture of iodine with perfect success\r\nin an old and obstinate case.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANKER IN THE EAR.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather indefinite term, as applied to the diseased ear of a\r\ndog; in fact, any malignant corroding sore may be called a canker, no\r\nmatter where situated. Some writers describe, under the head of canker,\r\na violent chronic otitis, attended by a purulent sanguinoid discharge.\r\nOthers understand by canker a species of erysipelatous inflammation,\r\nthat makes its appearance on the inside of the flap, and extends itself\r\nto the interior of the ear. What we understand by canker, is an acute\r\ninflammation of the lining membrane of the ear, destroying the tympanum\r\nor drum, and producing total deafness. The secretion is often\r\nconsiderable, and if not removed, will soon fill up the cavity of the\r\near with a dark reddish deposit, which greatly increases the irritation\r\nand inflammation of the parts. Mr. Blaine states that he has seen this\r\ndisease take a very malignant character, and extend its ravages over the\r\nface, destroying the soft parts, and even penetrating through the bone\r\ninto the interior of the head.\r\n\r\n'Causes'.--This disease may he excited by any of those causes that\r\nproduce a general or local inflammatory action; exposure to cold, the\r\npresence of malignant diseases on other portions of the body, high\r\nliving, heat, confinement, or extraneous substances lodged in the organ\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWater-dogs are most subject to this affection, owing, no doubt, to the\r\nfrequent afflux of blood to these parts, while the remainder of the body\r\nis immersed in the water. A tendency to this peculiar inflammation may\r\nalso be produced in these animals by the action of the water upon the\r\ndelicate membranes of the ear, which occasions a violent shaking of the\r\nhead and beating of the flaps, which not unfrequently bruises them\r\nconsiderably. Dogs that seldom or never go into the water are not,\r\nhowever, by any means exempt from the disease; as we have often seen it\r\ndeveloped in terriers, mastiffs, and every species of mongrel.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--When the disease appears in its acute form, and without\r\nany apparent cause beyond luxurious living and confinement, bleeding,\r\npurging, low diet, and regular exercise, together with tepid and\r\nsoothing washes, will generally relieve the inflammatory action of the\r\nparts. The ear should be carefully and tenderly washed out with castile\r\nsoap, and a small quantity of the following solution poured into it two\r\nor three times daily, and the ear worked about gently in the hand to\r\nsecure the percolation of the fluid through its structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]    Goulard's extract         [Symbol: ounce] sj.\r\n                Water                                 1 pint.\r\n      Mix.\r\n                                             or,\r\n[Symbol: Rx]    Sugar of lead             [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n                Water                     [Symbol: ounce]   i.\r\n      Mix.\r\n                                             or,\r\n[Symbol: Rx]    Powdered alum             [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n                Water                     [Symbol: ounce]   i.\r\n      Mix.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above mixtures should be warmed before using, otherwise the dog may\r\nresist their introduction.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease from bad treatment or neglect has subsided into the\r\nchronic form, and ulceration and suppuration have commenced, it will be\r\nnecessary to pursue a somewhat different treatment, and remain more\r\npatient, awaiting the result.\r\n\r\nAt this time the auditory passage is filled with a dark purulent\r\nsecretion, which forms a thick and irritating crust.\r\n\r\nThis deposit should first be removed by washing with castile soap and\r\ntepid water, and the daily application of a hop poultice. If there be\r\nmuch inflammatory action of the parts, the dog may be bled, and\r\nalterative or purgative balls administered. The following wash must be\r\nused two or three times daily.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]    Sugar of lead               [Symbol: scruple]  i.\r\n                Laudanum                        gtt.--20 (drops.)\r\n                Water                       [Symbol: ounce]    i.\r\n      Mix.\r\n\r\nAs the discharge is usually very offensive, the following solution will\r\ncorrect its fetor, and should be injected or poured in the ear.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]   Chloride of lime             [Symbol: drachm]   i.\r\n               Water                        [Symbol: ounce]   vi.\r\n      Mix.\r\n\r\nIf granulations have sprung up, touch them with a camel's hair brush,\r\ndipped in the following mixture:\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]    Sulphate of copper          [Symbol: scruple] i.\r\n                Water                       [Symbol: ounce]   i.\r\n      Mix.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the excrescences continue to sprout from the cartilage, and\r\nthe discharge continues unabated and offensive, they may be excised and\r\nthe parts brushed over with nitrate of silver in substance. After this\r\noperation the flap often becomes extremely tender and much swollen;\r\npoultices of poppy-heads or hops will often afford much relief.\r\n\r\nSetons are of much value in the treatment of obstinate cases, and should\r\nbe placed in the poll, and kept open till a cure is effected, or the\r\ncase abandoned.\r\n\r\nAll greasy applications to the parts should be discarded; the only one\r\nwe consider allowable would be a very nice preparation of fresh butter,\r\nalum, and laudanum, smeared over the surface of the ulcers when very\r\nindolent and painful.\r\n\r\nThe following wash will be found very soothing in the same case:\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Rx]   Opium                              gtt. 20.\r\n               Gum arabic                         iss--\r\n               Lime water              [Symbol: ounce] iv.\r\n\r\nIf the disease has progressed far enough to destroy a considerable\r\nportion of the cartilages, and perforate the tympanum, more care is\r\nnecessary in using the above washes, as the fluid will enter the\r\ninternal ear through this opening, and cause much uneasiness to the\r\nanimal, if not fatal consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE EAR.\r\n\r\nWounds of the flap are often occasioned by the tearing of poisonous\r\nbriars, while hunting in close cover, or in conflict with other dogs.\r\n\r\nThe former will generally heal up without much trouble, but the latter,\r\nwhen extensive, sometimes two or three inches in length, by requiring\r\nuniting by one or more sutures, to prevent deformity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTS.\r\n\r\nWhen these little excrescences appear on the external or internal\r\nportions of the flap, they may be taken off with the knife, and caustic\r\napplied to the wound, to induce them to heal, and keep down further\r\ngranulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANKER OF THE EDGE OF THE FLAP.\r\n\r\nWhen a corroding sore of this nature attacks the edges of the ear, and\r\nrefuses to yield to the application of a few stimulating washes, such as\r\nsulphate of copper, alum, borax, nitrate of silver, &c., the diseased\r\nedges may be paired off, and the actual cautery applied to the parts.\r\nThis will frequently arrest its further progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYPUS OF THE EAR\r\n\r\nPolypi often spring up from the interior of the ear; they may be cut off\r\nwith the scissors, or by the application of a fine wire, or horse-hair\r\nligature. The wound should be touched with caustic, tincture of iodine,\r\nor the actual cautery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE EAR--MANGY EDGES\r\n\r\nThis affection generally accompanies the same disease in other portions\r\nof the body, but may occasionally make its appearance independent of\r\nthis cause. The edges of the flap become rough, thickened, and furrowed,\r\nthe itching intolerable; and the dog perpetually shaking and scratching\r\nthe head, occasions a constant oozing of blood from the wound.\r\nSmooth-baited dogs are most subject to this disease, such as pointers,\r\nhounds, and terriers.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'--Slightly stimulating washes, such as castile soap,\r\nalum-water, or infusion of oak-bark, will, in the majority of cases,\r\ninduce these sores to heal up. If these do not answer, it will be\r\nnecessary to use the mange ointment, keeping the animal hobbled to\r\nprevent him from scratching. Old inveterate cases are best cured by\r\ntrimming off the affected parts.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X--ANATOMY AND DISEASES OF THE NOSE AND MOUTH ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ETHMOID BONES.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty in describing the ethmoid bones; but we shall\r\nnot, however, deviate far from the truth if we give the following\r\naccount:\r\n\r\nA great number of small hollow pedicles proceed from and form around the\r\ncribriform plate; as they move downwards, they project into distinct\r\nvesicles or cavities, smaller and more numerous behind, fewer in number\r\nand larger in front; and each of them not a simple cavity, but more or\r\nless convoluted, while the long walls of those cells are of gossamer\r\nthinness, and as porous as gauze. They even communicate, and are lined,\r\nand externally wrapped together, by the same membrane; the whole\r\nassuming a pear-like form, attached by its base or greater extremity,\r\nand decreasing in size as it proceeds downwards; the cells becoming\r\nfewer, and terminating at length in a kind of apex, which passes under\r\nthe superior turbinated bone, and forms a valve between the nasal cavity\r\nand the maxillary sinuses. If to this is added, that the olfactory or\r\nfirst pair of nerves abut on these cribriform plates, and pass through\r\ntheir minute openings, and spread themselves over every one of these\r\ncells, we have a tolerably correct picture of this portion of the\r\nethmoid bones. This nerve has different degrees of development in\r\ndifferent animals, in proportion to their acuteness of smell. There is\r\ncomparatively but little necessity for acuteness in the horse. The ox\r\nhas occasion for somewhat more, especially in the early part of the\r\nspring, when the plants are young, and have not acquired their peculiar\r\nscent. In the sheep it is larger, and fills the superior portion of the\r\nnasal cavity; but in the dog it seems to occupy that cavity almost to\r\nthe exclusion of the turbinated bones. It is also much more fragile in\r\nthe dog than in the ox, and the plates have a considerably thinner\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe ethmoid bone of the horse or the ox may be removed from its\r\nsituation with little injury; but that of the dog can scarcely be\r\nmeddled with without fracture. Below it are the two turbinated bones;\r\nbut they are reduced to insignificance by the bulk of the ethmoid bone.\r\nThe inferior turbinated bone in the dog is very small, but it is\r\ncuriously complicated.\r\n\r\nThe 'meatus' contains three distinct channels; and the air, loitering,\r\nas it were, in it, and being longer in contact with the sensitive\r\nmembrane by which it is lined, contributes to the acuter sense of smell.\r\nThe larger cavity is along the floor of the nasal duct. It is the proper\r\nair-passage; and because it has this important function to discharge, it\r\nis out of the way of violence or injury.\r\n\r\nThe 'lachrymal duct' is the channel through which the superfluous tears\r\nare conveyed to the lower parts of the nostril. A long canal here\r\ncommences, and runs down and along the maxillary bone. It is very small,\r\nand terminates in the cuticle, in order that the highly sensitive\r\nmembrane of the nose may not be excoriated by the tears occasionally\r\nrendered acrimonious in inflammation of the eye. The oval termination of\r\nthis duct is easily brought into view by lifting the nostril.\r\n\r\nFrom some occasional acrimony of the tears, the lining of this duct may\r\nbe inflamed and thickened, or some foreign body, or some unctuous matter\r\nfrom the ciliary glands, may insinuate itself into the duct, and the\r\nfluid accumulates in the sac and distends it, and it bursts; or the\r\nulcer eats through the integument, and there is a small fistulous\r\nopening beneath the inner canthus of the eye, or there is a constant\r\ndischarge from it. It is this constant discharge that prevents the wound\r\nfrom healing. In some cases the lachrymal bone is involved in the\r\nulcerative process and becomes carious. In the dog, and particularly in\r\nthe smaller spaniel, the watery eye, 'fistula lachrymalis', is of no\r\nunusual occurrence. The fistula will be recognised by a constant,\r\nalthough perhaps slight, discharge of pus.\r\n\r\nThe structure and office of the 'velum palati', or veil of the palate,\r\nis in the horse a perfect interposed section between the cavity of the\r\nmouth and the nose, and cutting off all communication between them. In\r\nthe dog, who breathes almost entirely through the mouth, the velum\r\npalati is smaller; the tensor muscle, so beautifully described by Mr.\r\nPercivall, is weak, but the circumflex one is stronger and more\r\ndeveloped. When 'coryza' in the dog runs on to catarrh, and the membrane\r\nof the pharynx partakes of the inflammation, the velum palati becomes\r\ninflamed and thickened, but will not act as a perfect communication\r\nbetween the mouth and the nose. When there is a defluxion from the nose,\r\ntinged by the colour of the food, and particles of food mingle with it,\r\nwe have one of the worst symptoms that can present itself, because it\r\nproves the extent and violence of the inflammation.\r\n\r\nIn inflammatory affections of the membrane of the nose in the dog, we\r\noften observe him snorting in a very peculiar way, with his head\r\nprotruding, and the inspiration as forcible as the expiration. An emetic\r\nwill usually afford relief, or grain doses of the sulphate of copper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NASAL BONES.\r\n\r\nThe nasal bones of the dog (see fig. 2, in the head of the dog, page\r\n181) are very small, as they are in all carnivorous animals. Instead of\r\nconstituting the roof, and part of the outer wall of the cavity, as in\r\nother animals, the nasal bones form only a portion, and a small one, of\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\nThe 'superior maxillaries' here swell into importance, and constitute\r\nthe whole of the outer wall, and, sometimes, a part of the roof. The\r\njaws are the weapons of offence and defence; and as much space as\r\npossible is devoted to the insertion of those muscles that will enable\r\nthe animal to seize and to hold his prey. One of the most powerful of\r\nthem, the 'masseter', rises from the superior maxillary bone, and\r\nspreads over its whole extent: therefore, that bone is developed, while\r\nthe nasal bone is compressed into a very small space. The substitution\r\nof a portion of cartilage, instead of bone, at the posterior part of the\r\norbital ring, in order to give more play for the coracoid process of the\r\nposterior maxillary, round which the temporal bone is wrapped, is a\r\ncontrivance of the same nature.\r\n\r\nThe scent of the dog is not sacrificed or impaired by the apparent\r\ndiminution of the nasals; for the cavity enlarges considerably upward,\r\nand is occupied chiefly by the 'ethmoid bone', which, having the greater\r\nportion of nervous pulp spread on it, seems to have most to do with the\r\nsense of smell.\r\n\r\nThe nasal bones of the dog are essentially different from those of the\r\nhorse, cattle, and sheep. They commence, indeed, as high up in the face\r\nas those of the horse, their superior extremities being opposite to the\r\nlachrymal gland; but that commencement is an apex or point varying\r\nmaterially in different breeds. They form, altogether, one sharp\r\nprojection, and are received within breeds these processes extend nearly\r\none-third of the length of the nasals.\r\n\r\nThe superior maxillary (3.3.) takes the situation of the nasal (2.),\r\npushes the lachrymal bone (4.) out of its place, and almost annihilates\r\nit, reaches the frontal bone (7.) and expands upon it, and forms with it\r\nthe same denticulated suture which is to be seen in the nasal. The\r\naction of the muscle between these bones, and for the development of\r\nwhich all this sacrifice is made, is exceedingly powerful. The strength\r\nof this muscle in a large dog is almost incredible: the sutures between\r\nthese bones must possess corresponding strength; and so strong is the\r\nunion between them, that, in many old dogs, the suture between the\r\nsuperior maxillary and frontal bones is nearly obliterated, and that\r\nbetween the nasal and frontal maxillary quite effaced.\r\n\r\nAs the nasal bones proceed downward they become somewhat wider. They\r\nunite with a long process of the anterior maxillary for the purpose of\r\nstrength, and then terminate in a singular way. They have their apexes\r\nor points on the outer edge of the bone; and these apexes or points are\r\nso contrived, that, lying upon, and seemingly losing themselves, on the\r\nprocesses of the anterior maxillary, they complete, superiorly and\r\nposteriorly, that elliptical bony opening into the nose which was\r\ncommenced by the maxillary anteriorly and inferiorly. The nasal cavity\r\nof the dog, therefore, and of all carnivorous animals, terminates by a\r\nsomewhat circular opening, more or less in the form of an ellipse. This\r\nbony aperture varies in size in different dogs, and, as we should expect\r\nfrom what we have seen of the adaptation of structure to the situation\r\nand wants of the animal, it is largest in those on whom we are most\r\ndependent for speed and stoutness.\r\n\r\nThe 'olfactory', or first pair of nerves, have a double origin, namely,\r\nfrom the 'corpus striatum' and the base of the 'corpus callosum'. They\r\nare prolongations of the medullary substance of the central portion of\r\nthe brain. They are the largest of the cerebral nerves. Their course is\r\nexceedingly short; and they have not a single anastomosis, in order that\r\nthe impression made on them may be conveyed undisturbed and perfect to\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nThe olfactory nerve is a prolongation of the substance of the brain, and\r\nit abuts upon the cribriform bone, of which mention has been made. I\r\nwill not speak of the singular cavities which it contains, nor of their\r\nfunction; this belongs to the sensorial system: but its pulpy matter has\r\nalready been traced to the base of the ethmoid bone, and the under part\r\nof the septum, and the superior turbinated bone. Although we soon lose\r\nit in the mucous membrane of the nose, there is little doubt that in a\r\nmore filmy form it is spread over the whole of the cavity, and probably\r\nover all the sinuses of the face and head. It is, however, so mingled\r\nwith the mucous membrane, that no power of the lens has enabled us to\r\nfollow it so far. It is like the 'portio mollis of the seventh pair,\r\neluding the eye, but existing in sufficient substances for the\r\nperformance of its important functions.\r\n\r\nWe have frequent cases of 'Ozæna' in old dogs, and sometimes in those\r\nthat are younger. The discharge from the nostril is abundant and\r\nconstant, and sometimes fetid. The Schneiderian membrane, of more than\r\nusual sensibility in this animal, is exposed to many causes of\r\nirritation, and debilitated and worn out before its time. Pugs are\r\nparticularly subject to Ozæna. I scarcely ever knew a very old pug that\r\nhad it not to a greater or less degree. The peculiar depression between\r\nthe nasal and frontal bones in this breed of dogs, while it almost\r\ntotally obliterates the frontal sinuses, may narrow the air-passage at\r\nthat spot, and cause greater irritation there from the unusual rush of\r\nthe air, and especially if the membrane becomes inflamed or any foreign\r\nbody insinuates itself.\r\n\r\nLittle can be done in these cases, except to encourage cleanliness about\r\nthe face and nostrils. It is, in the majority of these cases, a disease\r\nof old age, and must take its course.\r\n\r\nA terrier uttered a continual loud stertorous sound in breathing, which\r\ncould be plainly heard in our parlour when the dog was in the hospital.\r\nThe animal was evidently much oppressed and in considerable pain. He\r\nmade continual, and generally ineffectual, efforts to sneeze. When he\r\ndid succeed, a very small quantity of pus-like fluid was discharged; the\r\ndog was then considerably relieved, but a quarter of an hour afterwards\r\nhe was as bad as ever. I ordered a slight emetic every third day. There\r\nwas some relief for seven or eight hours, and then he was as bad as\r\never. I could neither feel nor see any cause of obstruction. The owner\r\nbecame tired, and the dog was taken away; but we could not learn what\r\nbecame of it.\r\n\r\nAnother terrier was occasionally brought for consultation. The dog\r\nbreathed with considerable difficulty, and occasionally snorted with the\r\ngreatest violence, and bloody purulent matter was discharged; after\r\nwhich he was somewhat relieved; but, in the course of a few days, the\r\nobstruction was as great as ever. I am not aware of a single instances\r\nof this affection of the pug being completely removed. The discharge\r\nfrom the nostrils of the bull-dog is often considerable, and, once being\r\nthoroughly established, is almost as obstinate as in the pug.\r\n\r\n\r\nOZÆNA.\r\n\r\nOzæna, or fetid discharge from the nose, is, perhaps, the most\r\ntroublesome and frequent affection that this organ is subject to; it is\r\nattended, at first, with slight fever, swelling of the parts, and a\r\nfetid discharge from the nostrils, which, if not corrected in the early\r\nstage of the disease, subsides into a chronic purulent secretion, that\r\nnot only weakens the dog, but renders him peculiarly offensive. Caries\r\nand destruction of the bones of the nose will ultimately take place.\r\n\r\n'Causes'.--Inflammation of the lining membrane of the nose, either\r\nidiopathic, or arising from distemper, or other morbid disturbance of\r\nthe system. It may also be a symptom, or the produce, of polypi in this\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--In commencing the treatment of this disease, it will be\r\nnecessary first to prescribe some alterative medicines, as balls of\r\naloes and rhubarb, and protect the animal from all severe atmospherical\r\nvicissitudes. This precaution, in connexion with mild astringent\r\ninjections into the seat of the disorder, will generally effect a cure.\r\n\r\n'Injections for Ozæna'.\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Sulphate of Zinc.........................grs. v to x.\r\n              Water..............................[Symbol: ounce] i.\r\n              Mix.\r\n\r\nNo. 2.\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Alum.............................[Symbol: scruple] ii.\r\n              Water..............................[Symbol: ounce] i.\r\n              Mix\r\n\r\nNo. 3.\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Chloride of Soda........................grs. v. to x.\r\n              Water..............................[Symbol: ounce] i.\r\n              Mix.\r\n\r\nNo. 4.\r\n[Symbol: Rx]  Teneriffe, Madeira or Sherry wine..[Symbol: ounce] i.\r\n              Extract of Tannin.............................grs. iv.\r\n              Mix.\r\n\r\n[Any of the above injections will answer a good purpose. No. 3 is\r\nparticularly useful to correct the fetidness of the discharge. When the\r\ndisease is an old chronic affection, it should not be arrested too\r\nsuddenly by astringent injections; in such cases it will be better to\r\ninsert a seton in the poll, and thus keep up a drain from the system\r\nafter the suppression of the other.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SENSE OF SMELL.\r\n\r\nIn the dog we trace the triumph of 'olfactory power'. How indistinct\r\nmust be that scent which is communicated to, and lingers on, the ground\r\nby the momentary contact of the foot of the hare, the fox, or the deer;\r\nyet the hound, of various breeds, recognises it for hours, and some\r\nsportsmen have said for more than a day. He also can not only\r\ndistinguish the scent of one species of animal from another, but that of\r\ndifferent animals of the same species. The fox-hound, well broken-in,\r\nwill rarely challenge at the scent of the hare, nor will he be imposed\r\nupon when the crafty animal that he pursues has taken refuge in the\r\nearth, and thrusts out a new victim before the pack.\r\n\r\nThe sense of smelling is, to a certain degree, acute in all dogs. It is\r\na provision wisely and kindly made, in order to guide them to their\r\nproper food, or to fit them for our service. It may possibly be the\r\nmedium through which much evil is communicated. Certain particles of a\r\ndeleterious nature may be, and doubtless are, arrested by the mucous\r\nmembrane of the nose, and there absorbed, and the constitution, to a\r\nconsiderable degree, becomes affected. Hence appears the necessity for\r\nattention to ventilation, and especially to prevent the membrane of the\r\nnose from being habitually stimulated and debilitated by the effluvia\r\ngenerated in a close and hot kennel.\r\n\r\nM. Majendie instituted some curious experiments on the sense of\r\nsmelling, and he was led to believe that it depended more on the fifth\r\npair of nerves than on the olfactory nerve. He divided the fifth pair,\r\nand from that moment no odour, no puncture, produced the slightest\r\napparent impression on the membrane of the nose. In another dog he\r\ndestroyed the two olfactory nerves, and placed some strong odours\r\nbeneath the nostrils of the animal. The dog conducted himself as he\r\nwould have done in his ordinary state. Hence he concluded it probable\r\nthat the olfactory nerve was not that of smelling.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact, however, is, that there are two species of nerves here\r\nconcerned--those of common and of peculiar sensation. The olfactory\r\nnerve is the nerve of smelling, the fifth pair is that of common\r\nsensation. They are to a certain degree necessary to each other.\r\n\r\n'Scent'.--This leads us to the consideration of the term \"scent.\" It\r\nexpresses the odour or effluvium which is constantly issuing from every\r\nanimal, and especially when that animal is in more than usual exercise.\r\nIn a state of heat or excitement, the pores of the skin appear relaxed,\r\nand a fluid or aqueous vapour is secreted, which escapes in small or\r\nlarge quantities, adheres to the persona or substances on which it\r\nfalls, and is, particularly, received on the olfactory organs. The\r\nhound, at almost the earliest period, begins to comprehend the work\r\nwhich he has to perform. The peculiar scent which his nostrils imbibe\r\nurges him eagerly to pursue but the moment he ceases to be conscious of\r\nthe presence of the effluvium, he is at a perfect loss.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel, in his work on the Chase, very properly observes, that \"the\r\nscent most favourable to the hound is when the effluvium, constantly\r\nperspired from the game as it runs, is kept by the gravity of the air at\r\nthe height of his breast. It is then neither above his reach nor does he\r\nneed to stoop for it. This is what is meant when the scent is said to be\r\nbreast-high.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves begin to fall, the scent does not lie well in the cover.\r\nIt frequently alters materially in the same day. This depends\r\nprincipally on the condition of the ground and the temperature of the\r\nair, which should be moist but not wet. When the ground is hard and the\r\nair dry, there will seldom be much scent. The scent rarely lies with a\r\nnorth or east wind. A southerly wind without rain is the best. Sudden\r\nstorms are sure to destroy the scent. A fine sunshiny day is not good;\r\nbut a warm day without sun is always a good one. If, as the morning\r\nadvances, the drops begin to hang on the bushes, the scent will not lie.\r\nDuring a white frost the scent lies high, and also when the frost is\r\nquite gone; but at the time of its going off the scent never lies. In a\r\nhard rain, if the air is mild, the scent will sometimes be very good. A\r\nwet night often produces the best chases. In heathy countries, where the\r\ngame brushes the grass or the boughs as it goes along, the scent seldom\r\nfails. It lies best on the richest soils; but the countries that are\r\nfavourable to horses are not always so to hounds. The morning usually\r\naffords the best scent, and the game is then least able to escape. The\r\nwant of rest, added perhaps to a full belly, gives the hounds a decided\r\nsuperiority over an early-found fox; and the condition of the ground and\r\nthe temperature of the air are circumstances of much importance.\r\n\r\nSuch are the results of the best observations on scent; but, after all,\r\nwe have much to learn concerning it. Many a day that predicated to be a\r\ngood one for scent has turned out a very bad one, and 'vice versa'. An\r\nold or experienced sportsman, knowing this, will never presume to make\r\nsure of his scent.\r\n\r\nWe shall be forgiven if we pursue this subject a little at length.\r\n\r\nThere is not only a constant appropriation of new matter to repair the\r\nlosses that animals are continually sustaining, but there is a constant\r\nelaboration of gaseous or fluid matter maintaining the balance of the\r\ndifferent systems, and essential to the continuance of life. This\r\neffluvium, as the animal moves from place to place, is attracted and\r\ndetained for a while by the substances with which it comes into contact,\r\nor it remains floating in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar smell or scent belonging to each individual, either\r\ngenerally or under peculiar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe sportsman takes advantage of this; and, as most species of dogs\r\npossess great acuteness of olfactory power, they can distinguish, or\r\nare readily taught to distinguish, not only the scent of the hare from\r\nthat of the fox, but that of the hare or fox which they are pursuing\r\nfrom that of half a dozen others that may be started during the chase.\r\n\r\nThe dogs that are selected for this purpose are those the conformation\r\nof whose face and head gives ample room for the development of the\r\nolfactory apparatus, and these are the different species of hounds; but\r\na systematic education, and too often a great deal of unnecessary\r\ncruelty, is resorted to, in order to make them perfect in their work.\r\nThe distinction between the scent of the fox and that of the hare is\r\nsoon learned by the respective packs; and, when it is considered that\r\nthe hunted hare is perspiring at every pore, and her strength being\r\nalmost exhausted, she is straining every limb to escape from her\r\npursuers, the increasing quantity of vapour which exudes from her will\r\nprevent every other newly started animal from being mistaken for her.\r\n\r\nIt has been well observed that when the atmosphere is loaded with\r\nmoisture, and rain is at hand, the gas is speedily dissolved and mingles\r\nwith the surrounding air. A storm dissipates it at once, while the\r\ncessation of the rain is preceded by the return and increased power of\r\nscent. A cold, dry easterly wind condenses and absorbs it, and this is\r\neven more speedily and irretrievably done by superabundant moisture. On\r\nfallows and beaten roads the scent rarely lies well, for there is\r\nnothing to detain it, and it is swept away in a moment; while over a\r\nluxuriant pasture, or by the hedge-row, or on the coppice, it lingers,\r\nclinging to the grass or the bushes. In a sunshiny day the scent is\r\nseldom strong; for too much of it is evaporated by the heat. The most\r\nfavourable period is a soft southerly wind without rain, the scent being\r\nof the same temperature and gravity with the atmosphere. Although it\r\nspreads over the level, it rises not far above the ground, and, being\r\n'breast high', enables the hound, keeping his muzzle in the midst of it,\r\nto run at his greatest speed. The different manners or attitudes in\r\nwhich the dog runs afford pleasing and satisfactory illustrations of the\r\nnature of the scent. Sometimes they will be seen galloping with their\r\nnoses in the air, as if their game had flown away, and, an hour or two\r\nafterwards, every one of them will have his muzzle on the ground. The\r\nspecific gravity of the atmosphere has changed, and the scent has risen\r\nof fallen in proportion.\r\n\r\nA westerly wind stands next to a southerly one, for a hunting morning.\r\nThis is all simple enough, and needs not the mystification with which it\r\nhas been surrounded. A valuable account of this may be found in\r\nJohnson's Shooting Companion, a work that is justly and highly approved.\r\n\r\nMr. Delmé Radcliffe has also, in his splendid work on \"the noble\r\nscience,\" some interesting remarks on the scent of hounds. He says that\r\nthere is an idiosyncracy, a peculiarity, in their several dispositions.\r\nSome young hounds seem to enter on their work instinctively. From their\r\nfirst to their last appearance in the field they do no wrong. Others,\r\nequally good, will take no notice of anything; they will not stoop to\r\nany scent during the first season, and are still slack at entering even\r\nat the second; but are ultimately distinguished at the head of the pack;\r\nand such usually last some seasons longer than the more precocious of\r\nthe same litter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TONGUE.\r\n\r\nThe manner of drinking is different in the different animals. The horse,\r\nthe ox, and the sheep do not plunge their muzzles into the water, but\r\nbring their lips into contact with it and sip it gradually. The dog,\r\nwhose tongue is longer, plunges it a little way into the fluid, and,\r\ncurving its tip and its edges, laps, in the language of Johnson, with a\r\n\"quick reciprocation of the tongue.\" The horse sucks the water that is\r\nplaced before him, the dog laps it; and both of them are subject to\r\ninflammation of the tongue, to enlargement of that organ, and to a\r\nconsiderable or constant flow of saliva over it.\r\n\r\nExtending from the base to the tip of the tongue there is on either side\r\na succession of tendons, which help to retain the tongue in the mouth,\r\nand to curve the edge of it, so as to convey the food or the water to\r\nthe posterior part of the mouth. These all spring from one central cord,\r\nand ramify over the membrane of the tongue. On opening the mouth, and\r\nkeeping it open by means of two pieces of tape, one behind the upper\r\ncanine teeth, and the other behind the lower ones, and drawing the\r\ntongue from the mouth and exposing its under surface, a cuticular fold\r\nor ridge will present itself, occupying a middle line from the base of\r\nthe tongue to its very point. If this is opened with a lancet, a minute\r\nfibrous cord will be exposed through its whole extent. It is the cord\r\nwhich governs the motions of the tongue.\r\n\r\nThis cord is, sometimes, foolishly and uselessly detached from its\r\nadhesions, so far as we can effect it, and drawn forward with a\r\ntenaculum and divided. There is one abominable course pursued in\r\neffecting this. The violence used in stripping down the tendon is so\r\ngreat, and the lacerated fibrous substance is put so much on the stress,\r\nand its natural elasticity is so considerable, that it recoils and\r\nassumes the appearance of a dying worm, and the dog is said to have been\r\nwormed. For the sake of humanity, as well as to avoid the charge of\r\nignorance, it is to be hoped that this practice will speedily cease.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLAIN.\r\n\r\nThe blain is a vesicular enlargement on the lateral and under part of\r\nthe tongue in horses, oxen, and dogs, which, although not of unfrequent\r\noccurrence, or peculiarly fatal result, has not been sufficiently\r\nnoticed by veterinary authors. In the horse and the dog it is often\r\nunaccompanied by any previous indisposition, or by other disease; but\r\nsuddenly there is a copious discharge of saliva, at first limpid and\r\nwithout smell, but soon becoming purulent, bloody, and exceedingly\r\nfetid. On examination, the tongue is found apparently enlarged. It is\r\nelevated from its base between the maxillary bones, and on the side and\r\ntowards the base of it are seen large vesicles, pellucid, red, livid, or\r\npurple; and, if the discharge is fetid, having near their bases ulcers,\r\nirregular, unhealthy, and gangrenous.\r\n\r\nIn the horse and the dog the progress of the disease is slow, and seldom\r\nextends beyond the sides of the tongue. The vesicles are not of such\r\nmagnitude as to interfere with respiration, and the ulcers are neither\r\nmany nor foul.\r\n\r\nIn cattle it is sadly different. The vesicles attain an enormous size.\r\nThey quickly break and form deep ulcerations, which are immediately\r\nsucceeded by other vesicles still larger. The whole membrane of the\r\nmouth becomes affected; the inflammation and swelling extend to the\r\ncellular substance of the neighbouring parts, and the head and neck are\r\nconsiderably, and sometimes enormously, enlarged; the respiratory\r\npassages are obstructed; the animal breathes with the greatest\r\ndifficulty, and is, in some cases, literally suffocated.\r\n\r\nThe primary seat of blain, is the cellular substance beneath the\r\nintegument of the part. As the sublingual glands stretch along the under\r\npart of the tongue, and their ducts open on the side of the frænum, it\r\nis possible that this disease may proceed from, or be connected with,\r\nobstruction or inflammation of these ducts. Dissection, however, has not\r\nproved this; and the seat of the disease, when the swellings are first\r\ndiscovered, is chiefly the cellular tissue between the integument and\r\nthe lateral parts of the tongue, and also that between the membrane of\r\nthe mouth and the sublingual glands.\r\n\r\n'Post-mortem' examination shows intense disease: the small intestines\r\nare highly inflamed with red and black patches, which are also found in\r\nthe c¾cum, colon, and rectum.\r\n\r\nThe blain is more frequent in spring and summer than at other seasons of\r\nthe year. These are the times when the animal is debilitated by the\r\nprocess of moulting, and is then more than usually disposed to\r\ninflammatory complaints. It is usually an epidemic disease. Many cases\r\nof it occur about the same time in certain districts, and over a great\r\nextent of country. When it appears in towns, the country is rarely\r\nexempt from it. I am not prepared lo say that it is contagious either in\r\nthe horse or the dog. I have not seen any instance of it. At all events,\r\nit is not so virulent in these animals as it is in cattle.\r\n\r\nThe vesicles should be freely lanced from end to end. There will not,\r\nperhaps, be much immediate discharge; for the vesicle will be distended\r\nby a substance imperfectly organised, or of such a glassy or inspissated\r\nnature as not readily to escape. It will, however, soon disappear; and\r\nin four-and-twenty hours, in the majority of cases, the only vestige of\r\nthe disease will be an incision, not, perhaps, looking very healthy, but\r\nthat will soon become so and heal. If there have been any previous\r\nulcerations, or the slightest fetor, the mouth should he frequently\r\nwashed with a diluted solution of the chloride of lime; one part of the\r\nsaturated solution, and eleven of water. This will act as a powerful and\r\nuseful stimulus to the foul and indolent ulcer. When all unpleasant\r\nsmell is removed, the mouth should be bathed with a lotion composed of\r\nequal parts of tincture of myrrh and water, or half an ounce of alum\r\ndissolved in a quart of water, and two ounces of the tincture of catechu\r\nadded to the solution. I do not recollect a case in the horse or dog, in\r\nwhich these medicines were not employed with advantage. In cattle,\r\nbefore there has been fetor attending the discharge, or the constitution\r\nhas been materially affected, these simple means will perfectly succeed.\r\n\r\nIf the practitioner is consulted somewhat too late, when the\r\nconstitution has become affected, and typhoid fever has ensued, he\r\nshould still lance the tumours, and apply the chloride of lime and the\r\ntincture of myrrh, and give a gentle aperient. He should endeavour to\r\nrouse and support the system by tonic medicines, as gentian and colomba\r\nwith ginger, adding to two drachms of the first two, and one drachm of\r\nthe last, half an ounce of nitre; but he should place most dependence on\r\nnourishing food. Until the mouth is tolerably sound, it is probable that\r\nthe animal will not be induced to eat; but it will occasionally sip a\r\nlittle fluid, and, therefore, gruel should be always within its reach.\r\nMore should occasionally be given, as thick as it will flow, with a\r\nspoon or small horn.\r\n\r\n[INFLAMMATION OF THE TONGUE.\r\n\r\nGlossitis or inflammation of the tongue is not an unfrequent disease,\r\nbut is occasionally met with in its simple form or in connexion with\r\ninflammatory affections of the throat. Under all and any circumstances\r\nthis affection must be considered a dangerous malady, as it not\r\nunfrequently proves fatal in the course of a few hours from suffocation,\r\noccasioned by the swelling of the organ itself and other portions of the\r\nthroat. The disease comes on suddenly with fever, heat, swelling and\r\nredness of the tongue. The tongue protrudes from the mouth and exhibits\r\na dry, hot, inflammatory appearance, the respiration is hurried, and the\r\nanimal expresses great uneasiness, and constant desire to lap water,\r\nwhich he can with difficulty accomplish. If not arrested, the\r\ninflammation may terminate in suppuration, by which process the swelling\r\nis relieved, and a cure often effected.\r\n\r\n'Causes'.--Independent of the natural agents before referred to in the\r\nproduction of inflammatory affections, there are some few causes to\r\nwhich we can especially attribute this disease.  Direct injuries done to\r\nthe member itself, either by wounds or stings of insects, the taking of\r\npoisonous or irritating substances into the mouth, want of water while\r\nhunting in hot weather, &c.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago we witnessed the death of a very valuable pointer,\r\nsuffering from this disease produced by poison maliciously administered.\r\nHe was affected so suddenly and violently with inflammation of the\r\nthroat and tongue that his owner, Mr. F--, was lead to believe that a\r\nbone had lodged in the throat, which was the occasion of all the\r\ntrouble. After proper examination and considerable delay, he was forced\r\nto abandon this erroneous idea, but not in time to save the poor animal,\r\nwho soon died from strangulation or congestion of the lungs. This\r\nvaluable dog might have been saved if promptly and energetically treated.\r\n\r\nThe stings of wasps or bees may also produce this affection.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--Nothing can be done with this malady without the use of\r\nthe lancet, by which six or eight ounces of blood should be drawn at the\r\ncommencement of the disease. If the tongue is much swollen and very\r\ntender, longitudinal incisions should be made in it, extending as far\r\nback as possible, and their bleeding assisted by sponging the mouth out\r\nwith tepid water. Astringent applications may then be used as washes,\r\nsuch as alum water, strong vinegar, infusions of oak bark or solutions\r\nof nitrate of silver, four or six grains to the ounce, to be applied\r\nonce or twice a day. A large blister may also be placed under the\r\nthroat, and when the inflammation is sufficiently reduced to allow the\r\nintroduction of articles into the stomach, a powerful purge of aloes\r\nshould be given.  Nothing, however, can be done without copious\r\nbleeding.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIPS\r\n\r\nof the dog discharge, with somewhat less efficiency, the same office as\r\nin the horse, cattle, and sheep; and are usefully employed in gathering\r\ntogether the food, and conveying it to the mouth. The lips also secrete\r\nthe saliva, a fluid that is indispensably necessary for the proper\r\ncomminution of the food.\r\n\r\nSwellings on the inside of the cheek or upper lip, and extending nearly\r\nto the angle of the lip, are of frequent occurrence. A superficial sore\r\nspreads over it, slightly covered by a yellowish, mattery pellicle; and\r\non the teeth, and extending down the gums, there is a deposition of\r\nhardened tartarous matter, which is scaled off with a greater or less\r\ndegree of difficulty. It must be removed, or the sore will rapidly\r\nspread over the cheek. A lotion of equal parts of tincture of myrrh and\r\nwater, with a few drops of the tincture of cantharides, will be usually\r\nsufficient to cause the swelling to subside, and the pellicle to be\r\ndetached. The lip, however, will generally remain slightly thickened. A\r\nlittle soreness will sometimes return, but be easily reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEETH\r\n\r\nnext claim attention.\r\n\r\nAccording to the dentition of the dog by M. Girard and Linnæus, the\r\nfollowing is the acknowledged formula:\r\n\r\nIncisors, 5/6; Canines, (1-1)/(1-1); Molars, (6-6)/(7-7),=42.\r\n\r\nThe following cuts exhibit the front teeth of the dog in various\r\nstages of growth and decay:\r\n\r\n[Seven illustrations, shown in full in the html version of this text.]\r\n\r\nThe full-grown dog has usually 20 teeth in the upper, and 22 in the\r\nlower jaw, with two small supernumerary molars. All of them, with the\r\nexception of the tushes, are provided with a bony neck covered by the\r\ngums, and separating the body of the tooth from the root. The projecting\r\nportion of the teeth is more or less pointed, and disposed so as to tear\r\nand crush the food on which the dog lives. They are of a moderate size\r\nwhen compared with those of other animals, and are subject to little\r\nloss of substance compared with the teeth of the horse. In most of them,\r\nhowever, there is some alteration of form and substance, both in the\r\nincisors and the tushes; but this depends so much on the kind of food on\r\nwhich the animal lives, and the consequent use of the teeth, that the\r\nindication of the age, by the altered appearance of the mouth, is not to\r\nbe depended upon after the animal is four or five years old. The incisor\r\nteeth are six in number in each jaw, and are placed opposite to each\r\nother. In the lower jaw, the pincers, or central teeth, are the largest\r\nand the strongest; the middle teeth are somewhat less; and the corner\r\nteeth the smallest and the weakest. In the upper jaw, however, the\r\ncorner teeth are much larger than the middle ones; they are farther\r\napart from their neighbours, and they terminate in a conical point\r\ncurved somewhat inwards and backwards.\r\n\r\nAs long as the teeth of the full-grown dog are whole, and not injured by\r\nuse, they have a healthy appearance, and their colour is beautifully\r\nwhite. The surface of the incisors presents, as in the ruminants, an\r\ninterior and cutting edge, and a hollow or depression within. This edge\r\nor border is divided into three lobes, the largest and most projecting\r\nforming the summit or point of the tooth. The two lateral lobes have the\r\nappearance of notches cut on either side of the principal lobe; and the\r\nunion of the three resembles the 'fleur de lis', which, however, is in\r\nthe process of time effaced by the wearing out of the teeth. (Figs. 3\r\nand 4.)\r\n\r\nWhile the incisor teeth are young, they are flattened on their sides,\r\nand bent somewhat backwards, and there is a decided cavity, in which a\r\npulpy substance is enclosed. This, however, is gradually contracted as\r\nthe age of the dog increases.\r\n\r\nM. F. Cuvier speaks of certain supernumerary teeth occasionally\r\ndeveloped in each of the jaws. There is much irregularity accompanying\r\nthem; and they have even been supposed to have extended to seven or\r\neight in number.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDICATIONS OF AGE.\r\n\r\nThe dog displays natural indications of age. The hair turns gray to a\r\ncertain extent as in the human being. This commences about the eyes, and\r\nextends over the face, and weakens the sight; and, at ten years old, or\r\nearlier, in the majority of dogs, this can scarcely be mistaken. At\r\nfifteen or sixteen years the animal is becoming a nuisance, yet he has\r\nbeen known to linger on until he has reached his two-and-twentieth year.\r\n\r\nAmong the diseases from which the dog suffers, there are few of more\r\nfrequent occurrence than decayed teeth, especially in towns, or in the\r\nhabitations of the higher classes of society: the carious teeth, in\r\nalmost every case, becoming insufferably fetid, or  so loose as to\r\nprevent mastication; or an immense accumulation of tartar growing round\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe course which the veterinary surgeon pursues is an exceedingly simple\r\none. If any of the teeth are considerably loose, they must be removed.\r\nIf there is any deposit of tartaric acid, it must be got rid of by means\r\nof the proper instruments, not very different from those which the human\r\nsurgeon employs. The teeth must be perfectly cleaned, and every loose\r\none taken away. Without this the dog will be an almost insufferable\r\nnuisance. The decayed and loose teeth being removed, chlorinated lime\r\ndiluted with 15 or 20 times its bulk of water should be applied to the\r\ngums. By the use of this the ulcers will quickly heal; the fetor will be\r\nremoved, and the deposition of the tartar prevented. Mr. Blaine first\r\nintroduced the chlorinated lime for the accomplishment of these\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nTwo little histories out of a great number will sufficiently illustrate\r\nthese cases. A terrier had scarcely eaten during more than a week. He\r\ndropped his meat after attempting to chew it, and the breath was very\r\noffensive. Several of the teeth were loose, and the rest were thickly\r\nencrusted with tartar. The gums had receded from the teeth, and were\r\nred, sore, and ulcerated.\r\n\r\nI removed all the loose teeth; for experience had taught me that they\r\nrarely or never became again fixed. I next, with the forceps and knife,\r\ncleaned the others, and ordered the diluted chlorinated lime to be\r\nalternated with tincture of myrrh and water. The extraction of the loose\r\nteeth, and the removal of the tartar from those that were sound,\r\noccupied a full hour; for the dog resisted with all his might. He,\r\nhowever, soon began to eat; the lotions were continued; and five months\r\nafterwards, the mouth of the dog was not in the slightest degree\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nAn old dog should not be quite abandoned. A pug had only four teeth\r\nremaining beside the canines. They were all thickly covered with tartar,\r\nand two of them were very loose. The gums and lips were in a dreadfully\r\ncankerous state, and the dog was unable to eat. All that he could do was\r\nto lap a little milk or broth.\r\n\r\nI extracted the two loose teeth, cleaned the others, and ordered a\r\nlotion of equal parts of tincture of myrrh and water to be applied.\r\n\r\n'13th August', 1842.--A very considerable discharge of pus was observed,\r\nwith blood from the mouth, apparently proceeding from the cavity whence\r\none of the teeth had been extracted. The dog is exceedingly thirsty, and\r\nwalks round and round the water-dish, but is afraid to lap. He has not\r\neaten for two days. Use the lotion as before, and force him with strong\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\n'15th.' The dog has not voluntarily eaten, but is still forced with\r\nsoup. He is very costive. Give two grains of calomel and an equal\r\nquantity of antimonial powder.\r\n\r\n'18th.' He has eaten a very little, but gets thinner and weaker.\r\nContinue the lotion.\r\n\r\n'27th.' The ulcers are nearly healed, and the discharge of pus has\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n'31st.' The mouth is clean, the gums are healed, and there is no longer\r\nanything offensive about the dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARYNX\r\n\r\nis placed at the top of the windpipe, the exit from the lungs, and is\r\nalso connected with the Schneiderian membrane. At its upper part is the\r\nepiglottis, the main guard against the passage of the food into the\r\nrespiratory tubes, and, at the same time, of the instrument of the\r\nvoice. It consists of five cartilages united together by a ligamentous\r\nsubstance, and, by distinct and perfect articulations, adapting itself\r\nto every change of the respiratory process and the production of the\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nAt the base is the 'cricoid cartilage,' the support and bond of union of\r\nthe rest. Above are the 'arytenoid cartilages,' resting on the 'chorda\r\nvocales' and influencing their action. The 'epiglottis' is placed at the\r\nextremity of the opening into the windpipe, with its back opposed to the\r\npharynx, so that when a pellet of food passes from the pharynx in its\r\nway to the oesophagus, the epiglottis is applied over the glottis, and by\r\nthis means closes the aperture of the larynx, and prevents any portion\r\nof the food from passing into it. The food having passed over the\r\nepiglottis, that cartilage, from its elastic power, again rises and\r\nresumes its former situation.\r\n\r\nThe 'thyroid cartilage' envelopes and protects all the rest, and\r\nparticularly the lining membrane of the larynx, which vibrates from the\r\nimpulse of the air that passes. The vibrations spread in every direction\r\nuntil they reach the delicate membrane of the tympanum of the ear. That\r\nmembrane responds to the motion without, and the vibration is carried on\r\nto the pulp of the auditory nerve, deep in the recesses of the ear. The\r\nloudness of the tone--its acuteness or graveness--depends on the force\r\nof the expired air and the shortening or lengthening of the chord. Hence\r\nit is, that the tone of the bark of the dog, or the neighing of the\r\nhorse, depends so much on the age or size of the animal. Thus we compare\r\nthe shrill bark of the puppy with the hoarse one of the adult dog; the\r\nhigh-toned but sweet music of the beagle with the fuller and lower cry\r\nof the fox-hound, and the deep but melodious baying of the mastiff. I\r\nmay, perhaps, be permitted to add to these, the whinnying of the colt\r\nand the neighing of the horse.\r\n\r\nEach animal has his peculiar and intelligible language. He who has long\r\nlived among them will recognise the tone of delight at meeting, rising\r\ninto and terminating in a sharper sound; the strong and elevated tone\r\nwhen they are calling to or challenging each other at a distance; the\r\nshort expression of anger--the longer, deeper, hoarser tone of fear; the\r\nmurmur almost as deep, but softer, of habitual attachment, and the\r\nelevated yet melodious token of sudden recognition. I could carry on a\r\nconversation with a dog that I once possessed for several minutes, and\r\none perfectly intelligible to both.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the larynx is a frequent and dangerous complaint. It\r\nusually commences with, and can scarcely be distinguished from, catarrh,\r\nexcept that it is attended by cough more violent and painful, and the\r\ndog expectorates considerably. Acute laryngitis is not so frequent an\r\noccurrence; but there is much danger attending it. Blood must be\r\nabstracted to as great an extent as the pulse will bear, or until it\r\nbecomes evidently affected. To this must follow digitalis, nitre, tartar\r\nemetic, and aloes, and to these must be added a powerful blister. A\r\nconsiderable quantity is effused and organized, the membrane is\r\nthickened, perhaps permanently so, and the whole of the submucous\r\ncellular tissue becomes oedematous.\r\n\r\nThe dog is subject to sudden attacks of 'angina'. It has been imagined,\r\nfrom the appearances that are manifested, that some strange body is\r\narrested in the windpipe or the throat. There is no dread of water or of\r\nthe usual fluids; the dog will lap once or twice from that fluid which\r\nis placed before him, and turns slowly away from it; and this\r\ncircumstance gives rise to what is called dumb madness. The dog barks in\r\na particular manner, or rather howls like a rabid dog: he is out of\r\nspirits, has a strange, anxious, altered countenance, and is alternately\r\ncold and hot. Frequently added to this is redness of the buccal and\r\nnasal membranes. He refuses all solid food, and either will not drink or\r\nfinds it difficult to swallow anything. His mouth is generally open, and\r\ncontains a spumy matter exhaling an offensive smell. His tongue, charged\r\nwith a great quantity of saliva, protrudes from his mouth, and the\r\nsubmaxillary glands are enlarged. To these appearances are added a\r\nyellow tint of the eyes, constipation, and a small quantity of urine,\r\nsurcharged with a deep yellow colour. At this period the disease has\r\ngenerally reached a considerable degree of virulence. Often the\r\ninflammation extends to the back part of the mouth and larynx; and in\r\nthis last case the respiration is attended by a hoarse, hissing kind of\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the disease is rapid, and, in a few days, it reaches its\r\nhighest degree of intensity. It is always fatal when it is intense; and,\r\nwhen its influence is widely spread, it is a very dangerous complaint.\r\n\r\nSomewhat rarely the subjects of it recover. After death we find great\r\nredness and injection in all the affected nervous surfaces, and\r\nindications of abscesses in which suppuration was not fully established.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN ARTICLES IN THE THROAT\r\n\r\nWhen a substance, such as a bone, has become impacted in the throat, the\r\nbetter plan is to attempt to push it downwards into the stomach, as\r\nthere is but little hope of extracting it.\r\n\r\n[A portion of sponge may be securely tied on the end of a piece of\r\nratan, whalebone, or other flexible material, and inserted in the mouth,\r\nmay be carried over the tongue down the throat against the foreign\r\narticle, which may then be gently pushed before it. If this should not\r\nsucceed, and the substance appears firmly imbedded in the throat, an\r\nincision may be made in the oesophagus and the bone extracted.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHOCELE OR GOITRE\r\n\r\nin the dog is almost daily forced upon our notice. If a spaniel or\r\npug-puppy is mangy, pot-bellied, rickety, or deformed, he seldom fails\r\nto have some enlargement of the thyroid gland. The spaniel and the pug\r\nare most subject to this disease. The jugular vein passes over the\r\nthyroid gland; and, as that substance increases, the vein is sometimes\r\nbrought into sight, and appears between the gland and the integuement,\r\nfearfully enlarged, varicose, and almost appearing as if it were\r\nbursting. The trachea is pressed upon on either side, and the oesophagus\r\nby the left gland, and there is difficulty of swallowing. The poor\r\nanimal pants distressingly after the least exertion, and I have known\r\nabsolute suffocation ensue. In a few cases ulceration has followed, and\r\nthe sloughing has been dreadful, yet the gland has still preserved its\r\ncharacteristic structure. Although numerous abscesses have been formed\r\nin the lower part of it, and there has been considerable discharge,\r\nviscid or purulent, the upper part has remained as hard and almost as\r\nscirrhous as before.\r\n\r\n'Cause of Goitre'.--In many cases, this enlargement of the thyroid\r\nglands is plainly connected with a debilitated state of the constitution\r\ngenerally, and more particularly with a disposition to rickets. I have\r\nrarely seen a puppy that had had mange badly, and especially if mange\r\nwas closely followed by distemper, that did not soon exhibit goitre.\r\nPuppies half-starved, and especially if dirtily kept, are thus affected;\r\nand it is generally found connected with a loose skin, flabby muscles,\r\nenlarged belly, and great stupidity. On the other hand, I have seen\r\nhundreds of dogs, to all appearance otherwise healthy, in whom the\r\nglands of the neck have suddenly and frightfully enlarged. I have never\r\nbeen able to trace this disease to any particular food, whether solid or\r\nliquid; although it is certainly the frequent result of want of\r\nnutriment.\r\n\r\nSome friends, of whom I particularly inquired, assured me, that it is\r\nnot to any great extent prevalent in those parts of Derbyshire where\r\ngoitre is oftenest seen in the human being.\r\n\r\nIt is periodical in the dog. I have seen it under medical treatment, and\r\nwithout medical treatment, perfectly disappear for a while, and soon\r\nafterwards, without any assignable cause, return. There is a breed of\r\nthe Blenheim spaniel, in which this periodical goitre is very\r\nremarkable; the slightest cold is accompanied by enlargement of the\r\nthyroid gland, but the swelling altogether disappears in the course of a\r\nfortnight. I am quite assured that it is hereditary; no one that is\r\naccustomed to dogs can doubt this for a moment.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--I am almost ashamed to confess how many inefficient and\r\ncruel methods of treatment I many years ago adopted. I used mercurial\r\nfriction, external stimulants, and blisters; I have been absurd enough\r\nto pass setons through the tumours, and even to extirpate them with the\r\nknife. The mercury salivated without any advantage, the stimulants and\r\nthe blisters aggravated the evil; the setons did so in a tenfold degree,\r\nso that many dogs were lost in the irritative fever tint was produced;\r\nand, although the gland, when directed out, could not be reproduced, yet\r\nI have been puzzled with the complication of vessels around it, and in\r\none case lost my patient by hemorrhage, which I could not arrest.\r\n\r\nWhen the power of iodine in the dispersion of glandular tumours was\r\nfirst spoken of, I eagerly tried it for this disease, and was soon\r\nsatisfied that it was almost a specific. I scarcely recollect a case in\r\nwhich the glands have not very materially diminished; and, in the\r\ndecided majority of cases, they have been gradually reduced to their\r\nnatural size. I first tried an ointment composed of the iodine of\r\npotassium and lard, with some, but not a satisfactory result. Next I\r\nused the tincture of iodine, in doses of from five to ten drops, and\r\nwith or without any external local application; but I found, at length,\r\nthat the simple iodine, made into pills with powdered gum and syrup,\r\neffected almost all that I could wish. It is best to commence with the\r\neighth of a grain for a small dog, and rapidly increase it to half a\r\ngrain, morning and night. A larger dog may take from a quarter of a\r\ngrain to a grain. In a few instances, loss of appetite and slight\r\nemaciation have been produced; but then, the medicine being suspended\r\nfor a few days, no permanent ill effect has ever followed the exhibition\r\nof iodine.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHLEGMONOUS TUMOUR.\r\n\r\nA phlegmonous tumour under the throat, and accompanied by constitutional\r\ndisturbance, with the exception of there being little or no cough, often\r\nappears in the dog. Comparing the size of the animals, these tumours are\r\nmuch larger than in either the horse or ox; but they are situated higher\r\nup the face, and do not press so much upon the windpipe, nor is there\r\nany apparent danger of suffocation from them. The whole head, however,\r\nis sometimes enlarged to a frightful degree, and the eyes are completely\r\nclosed. More than a pint of fluid has sometimes escaped from a\r\nmiddle-sized dog at the first puncture of the tumour.\r\n\r\nThe mode of treatment is, to stimulate the part, in order to expedite\r\nthe suppuration of the tumour, and to lance it freely and deeply, as\r\nsoon as matter is evidently formed. The wound should be dressed with\r\ntincture of aloes, and a thick bandage placed round the neck, to prevent\r\nthe dog from scratching the part, which often causes dreadful\r\nlaceration.\r\n\r\nThese tumours in the throat of the dog are not always of a phlegmonous\r\ncharacter. They are cysts, sometimes rapidly formed, and of considerable\r\nsize, and filled with a serous or gelatinous fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY AND DISEASES OF THE CHEST; THE DIAPHRAGM; THE PERICARDIUM; THE\r\nHEART; PLEURISY; PNEUMONIA; SPASMODIC COUGH\r\n\r\nThe chest is the superior, or in quadrupeds the anterior, cavity of the\r\ntrunk of the body: it is divided into two cavities by a membranous\r\npartition, termed 'mediastinum;' and separated from the abdomen, or\r\ncavity which contains the liver, spleen, pancreas, and other abdominal\r\nviscera, by the 'diaphragm,' which is of a musculo-membranous nature.\r\nThis membrane may be described, as it is divided, into the main circular\r\nmuscle, with its central tendinous expansion forming the lower part, and\r\ntwo appendices, or 'crura,' as they are termed from their peculiar\r\nshape, constituting its superior portion. We trace the fleshy origin of\r\nthe grand muscle, laterally and inferiorly, commencing from the\r\ncartilage of the eighth rib anteriorly, and following somewhat closely,\r\nas we proceed backward, the union of the posterior ribs with their\r\ncartilages, excepting, however, the two last. The attachment is\r\npeculiarly strong. It is denticulated: it encloses the whole of the\r\nlatter and inferior part of the chest as far as the sternum, where it is\r\nconnected with the ensiform cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is the main agent, both in ordinary and extraordinary\r\nrespiration. In its quiescent state it presents its convex surface\r\ntowards the thorax, and its concave one towards the abdomen. The\r\nanterior convexity abuts upon the lungs; the posterior concavity is\r\noccupied by some of the abdominal viscera.\r\n\r\nThus far we have described the diaphragm as found in the horse, ox, and\r\nsheep. There is some difference with regard to the dog. The muscular\r\npart of the diaphragm is thick and strong in every species of dog, while\r\nthe aponeurotic expansion is comparatively smaller. From the smaller\r\nexpanse of the thorax of the dog, and the consequent little expansion of\r\nthe diaphragm, the action, although occasionally rapid and violent--for\r\nhe is an animal of speed--is not so extensive, and more muscle and less\r\ntendon may be given to him, not only without detriment, but with evident\r\nadvantage. Therefore, although we have occasional rupture of the heart\r\nof the dog, oftener perhaps than in the horse, there is no case of\r\nrupture of the diaphragm on record.\r\n\r\nThe cavity of the thorax is lined by a membrane, termed pleura, which\r\ncovers the surface of the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe lungs on either side are enclosed in a separate and perfect bag,\r\nanil each lung has a distinct pleura. The heart lies under the left\r\nlung; and, more perfectly to cut off all injurious connexion or\r\ncommunication of disease between the lungs and the heart, the heart is\r\nenclosed in a distinct pleura or bag, termed the 'pericardium'. This\r\nmembrane closely invests the heart, supports it in its situation,\r\nprevents too great dilatation when it is gorged with blood, and too\r\nviolent action when it is sometimes unduly stimulated. Notwithstanding\r\nthe confinement of the pericardium, the heart, when under circumstances\r\nof unusual excitation, beats violently against the ribs, and, were it\r\nnot thus tied down, would often bruise and injure itself, and cause\r\ninflammation in the neighbouring parts.\r\n\r\nThe 'heart' is composed of four cavities; two above, called 'auricles',\r\nfrom their shape, and two below, termed 'ventricles', occupying the bulk\r\nof the heart. In point of fact, there are two hearts--the one on the\r\nleft side propelling the blood through the frame, and the other on the\r\nright side conveying it through the pulmonary system; but, united in the\r\nmanner in which they are, their junction contributes to their mutual\r\nstrength, and both circulations are carried on at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe beating of the heart in the dog is best examined behind the elbow on\r\nthe left side. The hand, applied flat against the ribs, will give the\r\nnumber and character of the pulsations. The pericardium, or outer\r\ninvesting membrane of the heart, is frequently liable to inflammation,\r\nmilked by a quickened and irregular respiration, and an action of the\r\nheart, bounding at an early period of the disease, but becoming scarcely\r\nrecognisable as the fluid increases. The patient is then beginning\r\ngradually to sink. A thickening of the substance of the heart is\r\noccasionally suspected, and, on the other hand, an increased capacity of\r\nthe cavities of the heart; the parietes being considerably thinner, and\r\nthe frame of the animal emaciated.\r\n\r\nThe pulse of the greater part of our domestic animals has been\r\ncalculated by Mr. Vatel, in his excellent work on Veterinary Pathology,\r\nto be nearly as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the horse,     from   32 to     38  pulsations in a minute.\r\n  \"  ox or cow,    \"     35  \"     49             \"\r\n  \"  ass,          \"     48  \"     54             \"\r\n  \"  sheep,        \"     70  \"     79             \"\r\n  \"  goat,        from   72  to    76  pulsations in a minute.\r\n  \"  dog,          \"     90  \"    100             \"\r\n  \"  cat,          \"    110  \"    120             \"\r\n  \"  rabbit,       .    .         120             \"\r\n  \"  guinea-pig,   .    .         140             \"\r\n  \"  crow,         .    .         136             \"\r\n  \"  duck,         .    .         136             \"\r\n  \"  hen,          .    .         140             \"\r\n  \"  heron,        .    .         200             \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pulse of the dog may be easily ascertained by feeling at the heart\r\nor the inside of the knee, and it varies materially, according to the\r\nbreed, as well as the size of the animal. This is very strikingly the\r\ncase with some of the sporting dogs, with whom the force as well as the\r\nrapidity of the pulse vary materially according to the character and\r\nbreed of the dog.\r\n\r\nThere is, occasionally, in the dog as in the human being, an alteration\r\nof the quantity, as well as of the quality, of the blood. 'Anæmia' is\r\nthe term used to designate a deficiency in quantity; 'plethora' is the\r\nopposite state of it. M. D'Arbor relates a very curious account of the\r\nformer:\r\n\r\nTwo dogs were sent into the hospital of the veterinary school at Lyons.\r\nThey did not appear to suffer any considerable pain. Their skin and\r\nmucous membranes that were visible had a peculiar appearance. They had\r\nalso comparatively little power over their limbs; so little, indeed,\r\nthat they rested continually on one side, without the ability to shift\r\ntheir posture. When they were placed on their feet, their limbs gave\r\nway, and they fell the moment they were quitted. In despite of the care\r\nthat was taken of them, they died on the second day.\r\n\r\nIncisions were made through the skin, but in opening them no blood\r\nflowed. The venæ cavæ themselves did not contain any--there were only\r\ntwo clots of blood in the cavities of their hearts. One of them, of the\r\nsize of a small nutmeg, occupied the left ventricle; the other, which\r\nwas still smaller, was found at the base of the right ventricle. The\r\nchest of one of them enclosed a small quantity of serosity; a similar\r\nfluid was between the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane, and the\r\nsame was the case in the larger ventricles of the encephalon. The other\r\nviscera did not offer anything remarkable, except the paleness and\r\nflaccidity of their tissue. The great fatigues of the chase, and the\r\nimmersion of these animals in water at the time that they were very much\r\nheated, appeared to have been the causes of this singular disease. In\r\nthe report of the labours of the School of Alfort, in the year 1825, the\r\nsame anæmia was remarked in two dogs that died there; one of them had\r\nlately undergone a considerable hemorrhage, and in the other anæmia had\r\ndeveloped itself spontaneously.\r\n\r\nIt is in fact among dogs that this extreme anæmia has been principally\r\nobserved, and is ordinarily fatal. It has been remarked by M. Crusal in\r\na bullock attacked with gastro-enteritis.\r\n\r\nThis disease, according to M. Vatel, is generally the symptom of a\r\nchronic malady, or the instantaneous effect of an excessive hemorrhage.\r\nIt is rarely primary. The extreme discoloration of the tissues, and of\r\nthe mucous membrane more particularly, the disappearance of the\r\nsubcutaneous blood-vessels, and the extreme feebleness of the animal,\r\nare the principal symptoms. There also often exists considerable\r\nswelling of the limbs.\r\n\r\nThe following singular case of a wound penetrating into the chest and\r\npericardium of a dog, is recorded by Professor Delafond:\r\n\r\nA mastiff dog fighting with another was stabbed in the chest by the\r\nmaster of his antagonist. Five hours after the accident, the Professor\r\nwas sent for. On the exterior of the sternum was a laceration an inch\r\nand a half in length, covered by a spumy fluid, from the centre of which\r\nwas heard a gurgling noise, showing that a wound had penetrated into the\r\nsac of the pleura. The respiration was quick, and evidently painful; the\r\nbeating of the heart was also strong and precipitate. The finger being\r\nintroduced into the wound, penetrated between the fourth and fifth rib\r\non the left side. \"Having arrived at the pleuritic sac,\" says the\r\nProfessor, \"I gently tapped the surface of the lung, in order to assure\r\nmyself that it was not injured; my finger penetrated into the\r\npericardium, and the point of the heart beat against it.\"\r\n\r\nHe bathed the wound with a little diluted wine, and brought the edges of\r\nit as near together as he could, and confined them with a suture,\r\nadministering a mild aperient.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the animal walked slowly about, seeking for\r\nsomething to eat; he gave him some milk. On changing the dressing, he\r\ntried whether he could again introduce any sound into the wound; but it\r\nwould only penetrate a very little way; indeed, re-union by adhesion had\r\nalready taken place.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day, the animal was in good spirits; the wound had a\r\nhealthy red appearance, and all tended to a speedy cure.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day he was sent home to his master, a distance of two\r\nleagues from his house. He saw the dog eighteen months afterwards, and\r\nhe was as eager as ever after his game.\r\n\r\nThe following is a case of rupture of the heart:--A black pointer, of\r\nthe Scotch breed, had every appearance of good health, except that she\r\nfrequently fell into a fit after having run a little way, and sometimes\r\neven after playing in the yard. She was several times bled during and\r\nafter these fits. When I examined her, I could plainly perceive\r\nconsiderable and violent spasmodic motion of the heart, and the sounds\r\nof the beating of the heart were irregular and convulsive. She was sent\r\nto the infirmary, in order to be cured of an attack of mange; but during\r\nher stay in the hospital she had these fits several times: the attack\r\nalmost always followed after she had been playing with other dogs. She\r\nappeared as if struck by lightning, and remained motionless for several\r\nminutes, her gums losing their natural appearance and assuming a bluish\r\nhue. After the lapse of a few minutes, she again arose as if nothing had\r\nbeen the matter. She was bled twice in eight days, and several doses of\r\nfoxglove were administered to her. The fits appeared to become less\r\nfrequent; but, playing one day with another dog, she fell and expired\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThe 'post mortem' examination was made two hours after death. The cavity\r\nof the pericardium contained a red clot of blood, which enveloped the\r\nwhole of the heart; it was thicker in the parts that corresponded with\r\nthe valve of the heart; and on the left ventricle, and near the base of\r\nthe left valve of the heart, and on the external part of that viscus,\r\nwas an irregular rent two inches long. It crossed the wall of the valve\r\nof the heart, which was very thin in this place. The size of the heart\r\nwas very small, considering the height and bulk of the dog. The walls of\r\nthe ventricles, and particularly of the left ventricle, were very thick.\r\nThe cavity of the left ventricle was very small; there was evidently a\r\nconcentric hypertrophy of these ventricles; the left valve of the heart\r\nwas of great size.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the rupture of the valve of the heart had\r\nevidently been an increase of circulation, brought on by an increase of\r\nexercise; but the remote cause consisted in the remarkable thinness of\r\nthe walls of the valve of the heart. This case is remarkable in more\r\nthan one respect; first, because examples of rupture of the valve of the\r\nheart are very rare; and, secondly, because this rupture had its seat in\r\nthe left valve of the heart, while, usually, in both the human being and\r\nthe quadruped, it takes place in the right; and this, without doubt,\r\nbecause the walls and the valves of the right side are thinner.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the investing membrane of the lungs, and the pleura of the\r\nthoracic cavity, and of the substance of the lungs, are more frequent\r\nthan those of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURISY,\r\n\r\nor inflammation of the membrane of the chest and the lungs of the dog,\r\nis not unfrequent. There are few instances of inflammation of the lungs,\r\nor pneumonia, that do not ultimately become connected with or terminate\r\nin pleurisy. The tenderness of the sides, the curious twitching that is\r\nobserved, the obstinate sitting up, and the presence of a short,\r\nsuppressed, painful cough, which the dog bears with strange impatience,\r\nare the symptoms that principally distinguish it from pneumonia.  The\r\nexploration of the chest by auscultation gives a true picture of it in\r\npleurisy; and, by placing the dog alternately on his chest, his back, or\r\nhis side, we can readily ascertain the extent to which effusion exists\r\nin the thoracic cavity; and, if we think proper, we can get rid of the\r\nfluid. It is not a dangerous thing to attempt, although it is very\r\nproblematical whether much advantage would accrue from the operation.\r\nWith a favourite dog it may, however, be tried; and, to prevent all\r\naccidents, a veterinary surgeon should be entrusted with the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMONIA,\r\n\r\nor inflammation of the substance of the lungs, is a complaint of\r\nfrequent occurrence in the dog, and is singularly marked. The extended\r\nhead, the protruded tongue, the anxious, bloodshot eye, the painful\r\nheaving of the hot breath, the obstinacy with which the animal sits up\r\nhour after hour until his feet slip from under him, and the eye closes,\r\nand the head droops, through extreme fatigue, yet in a moment being\r\nroused again by the feeling of instant suffocation, are symptoms that\r\ncannot be mistaken.\r\n\r\nHere, from the comparative thinness of the integument and the parietes,\r\nwe have the progress of the disease brought completely under our view.\r\nThe exploration of the chest of the dog by auscultation is a beautiful\r\nas well as wonderful thing. It at least exhibits to us the actual state\r\nof the lungs, if it does not always enable us to arrest the impending\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine and myself used cordially to agree with regard to the\r\ntreatment of pneumonia, materially different from the opinions of the\r\nmajority of sportsmen. Epidemic pneumonia was generally fatal, if it was\r\nnot speedily arrested in its course. The cure was commenced by bleeding,\r\nand that to a considerable extent, when not more than four-and-twenty or\r\nsix-and thirty hours had passed; for, after that, the progress of the\r\ndisease could seldom be arrested. Blistering the chest was sometimes\r\nresorted to with advantage; and the cantharides ointment and the oil of\r\nturpentine formed one of the most convenient as well as one of the most\r\nefficacious blisters. A purgative was administered, composed of mutton\r\nbroth with Epsom salts or castor oil; to which followed the\r\nadministration of the best sedatives that we have in those cases,\r\nnamely, nitre, powdered foxglove, and antimonial powder, in the\r\nproportion of a scruple of the first, four grains of the second, and two\r\ngrains of the third.\r\n\r\nCongestion of the lungs is a frequent termination of pneumonia; and in\r\nthat congestion the air-cells are easily ruptured and filled with\r\nblood. That blood assumes a black pulpy appearance, commonly indicated\r\nby the term of 'rottenness', an indication or consequence of the\r\nviolence of the disease, and the hopelessness of the case. A different\r\nconsequence of inflammation of the lungs is the formation of tubercles,\r\nand, after that, of suppuration and abscess, when, generally speaking,\r\nthe case is hopeless. A full account of this is given in the work on the\r\nHorse.\r\n\r\nTwo cases of pneumonia will be useful:\r\n\r\nOct. 22d, 1820. A black pointer bitch that had been used lo a warm\r\nkennel, was made to sleep on flat stones without straw. A violent cough\r\nfollowed, under which she had been getting worse and worse for a\r\nfortnight. Yesterday I saw her. The breathing was laborious. The bitch\r\nwas constantly shifting her position, and, whether she lay down or sat\r\nup, was endeavouring to elevate her head. Her usual posture was sitting,\r\nand she only lay down for a minute. The eyes were surrounded, and the\r\nnose nearly stopped with mucus. V. S. [Symbol: ounce] viij. Emet.\r\nFever-ball twice in the day.\r\n\r\n23d. Breathing not quite so laborious. Will not eat. Medicine as before.\r\nApply a blister on the chest.\r\n\r\n24th. Nearly the same. V. S. [Symbol: ounce] vj. Bol. utheri.\r\n\r\n26th. Decided amendment. She breathes with much less difficulty. Less\r\ndischarge both from eyes and nose. Bol. utheri.\r\n\r\nNov. 7th. Sent home well.\r\n\r\nA singular and not uninstructive case came before me. A lady in the\r\ncountry wrote to me to say, that her terrier was thin, dull, husking,\r\nand perpetually trying to get something from the throat; that her coat\r\nstared, and she frequently panted, I replied, that I apprehended she had\r\ncaught cold; and recommended bleeding to the extent of four ounces, a\r\ngrain each of calomel and emetic tartar to be given every fourth\r\nmorning, and a fever-ball, composed of digitalis, nitre, and tartrate of\r\nantimony, on each intermediate day.\r\n\r\nA few days after this I received another letter from her, saying, that\r\nthe dog was bled as ordered, and died on the following Thursday. That\r\nanother veterinary surgeon had been called in, who said that the first\r\none had punctured the 'vena cava' in the operation, and that the dog had\r\nbled to death internally; and she wished to know my opinion. I replied,\r\nthat the charge proceeded from ignorance or malice, or both. That in one\r\nsense he was right--the jugular, which the other had probably opened,\r\nruns into the vena cava, and may, with some latitude, be considered a\r\nsuperior branch of it; therefore, thus far the first man had punctured\r\nthe vena cava, which I had done many hundred times; but that the point\r\nof union of the four principal veins that form the vena cava was too\r\nsecurely seated in the upper part of the thorax for any lancet to reach\r\nit. That the rupture of some small arterial vessel might have caused\r\nthis lingering death, but that the puncture of a vein would either have\r\nbeen speedily fatal, or of no consequence; and that, probably, the\r\nanimal died of the disease which she had described.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPASMODIC COUGH\r\n\r\nis a troublesome disease to manage. Dogs, and especially those\r\nconsiderably petted, are subject to frequent cough, requiring a material\r\ndifference in the treatment. Sometimes there is a husky cough, not to so\r\ngreat a degree as in distemper, but followed by the same apparent effort\r\nto get something from the throat, the same attempt to vomit, and the\r\nejection of mucus, frothy or adhesive, and occasionally discoloured with\r\nbile. It proceeds from irritability or obstruction in some of the\r\nair-passages, and oftenest of the superior ones. An emetic will clear\r\nthe fauces, or at least force out a portion of the adhesive matter which\r\nis clogging the bronchial tubes.\r\n\r\nA cough of this kind, and attended in its early stages by little fever,\r\nseldom requires anything more for its cure than the exhibition of a few\r\ngentle emetics, consisting of equal portions of calomel and emetic\r\ntartar, given in doses varying from half a grain to one grain and a half\r\nof each.\r\n\r\nA harsh hollow cough is attended by more inflammatory action. The\r\ndepletive system must be adopted here. A loud and harsh cough will yield\r\nonly to the lancet and to purgatives, assisted by sedative medicines\r\ncomposed of nitre, antimonial powder, and digitalis, or small doses of\r\nsyrup of poppies, or more minute doses of the hydrocyanic acid; this\r\nlast medicine, however, should be carefully watched, and only given\r\nunder surgical advice.\r\n\r\n28th October, 1842. A spaniel was apparently well yesterday, but\r\ntowards evening a violent cough suddenly came on. It was harsh and\r\nhollow, and terminated in retching. There was a discharge of water from\r\nthe eyes; but the nose was cool and moist. Give an emetic, and then two\r\ngrains of the James's powder.\r\n\r\n29th The animal coughed almost the whole of the night. There was more\r\nwatery discharge from the eyes, which appeared to be red and impatient\r\nof light; the nose continued cool, and the dog did not refuse his food.\r\nAn aperient ball was given; and twice afterwards in the day, the nitre,\r\nantimonial powder, and digitalis.\r\n\r\n30th. The cough is as frequent, but not very loud. Give a mixture of\r\nsyrup of poppies and prussic acid morning and night, and the ball as\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n31st. Nearly in the same state as yesterday, except that he is not so\r\nthirsty, and does not eat so well. Give the mixture three times daily.\r\n\r\nNov. 1st. He had an emetic in the morning, which produced a large\r\nquantity of phlegm, but the cough is no better. No evacuation during the\r\ntwo last days. Give an aperient ball, and the mixture as before in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe prussic acid has been fairly tried; it has not in the least\r\nmitigated the cough, but begins to make the dog sick, and altogether to\r\ndestroy his appetite. Give three times in the day a mixture consisting\r\nof two-thirds of a drachm of syrup of poppies, and one-third of syrup of\r\nbuckthorn. The sickness ceased, and the cough remained as before, I then\r\ngave twice in the day half a grain of calomel, the same of opium, two\r\neach of pulvis antimonialis and digitalis, and four grains of nitre,\r\nmorning and noon, with six grains of the Dover's powder at night. This\r\nwas continued on the 3d, 4th and 5th of November, when there were longer\r\nintervals of rest, and the dog did not cough so harshly when the fit was\r\non him.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th, however, no medicine was given; but towards evening the dog\r\ncoughed as much as ever, and a decided mucous discharge commenced from\r\nthe nose and the eyes, with considerable snorting. An emetic was given,\r\nand the balls resorted to as before.\r\n\r\n'7th.' He appeared to be much relieved by the emetic. The cough was\r\nbetter, the dog ate well, and had regained his usual spirits. The ball\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n'9th'. Slight tenesmus now appeared. It quickly became frequent and\r\nviolent. The dog strained very much; but the discharge was small in\r\nquantity, and consisted of adhesive mucus. Give two drachms of castor\r\noil, and the fever ball with opium. The cough is worse, and the dog still\r\ncontinues to strain, no blood, however, appearing.\r\n\r\n'11th'. The opium and oil have had their desired effect, and the cough\r\nis better.\r\n\r\n'12th', Except the animal is kept under the influence of opium, the\r\ncough is dreadfully troublesome. I have, however, obtained one point. I\r\nhave been permitted to subtract four ounces of blood; but blood had been\r\nmingling with the expectorated mucus before I was permitted to have\r\nrecourse to the lancet.\r\n\r\n'13th'. The dog is better, and we again have recourse to the fever\r\nmixture, to which, on the '14th', I added a very small portion of the\r\ncarbonate of iron, for the dog was evidently getting weak. The sickness\r\nhas returned, and the cough is decidedly worse.\r\n\r\n'16th'. Rub a small quantity of rheumatic embrocation, and tincture of\r\ncantharides.\r\n\r\n'17th.' The first application of the blister had not much effect; but\r\nthis morning it began to act. The dog ran about the house as cross as he\r\ncould be for more than an hour; there was considerable redness on the\r\nthroat and chest. The cough, however, was decidedly better.\r\n\r\n'18th'. The cough is better. Again apply the embrocation.\r\n\r\n'19th.' The cough and huskiness have returned. Employ an emetic, and\r\ncontinue the embrocation.\r\n\r\n'20th'. The cough is decidedly worse. Continue the embrocation, and give\r\nthe fever mixture.\r\n\r\n'23d'. The embrocation and medicine have been daily used; but the cough\r\nis as bad as ever. Balls of assafoetida, squills, and opium were had\r\nrecourse to.\r\n\r\n25th. The second ball produced the most distressing sickness, but the\r\ncough was evidently relieved. The assafoetida was discontinued.\r\n\r\n'28th'. The cough, during the last two days, has been gradually getting\r\nworse. It is more laborious and longer, and the intervals between it are\r\nshorter. Give another emetic and continue the other medicine.\r\n\r\n30th'. The effect of the emetic was temporary, and the cough is again\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n'Dec'. 2d'. Very little change.\r\n\r\n5th'. The cough appears to be stationary. Again have recourse to the\r\nantimony, digitalis, and nitre.\r\n\r\n8th'. The cough is certainly better. Try once more the assafoetida. It\r\nagain produced sickness, but of a very mild character.\r\n\r\n12th'. The assafoetida was again used used morning and night. The cough\r\ncontinues evidently to abate.\r\n\r\n14th'. The dog coughs very little, not more than half-a-dozen times in\r\nthe day. Notwithstanding the quantity of medicine that has been taken,\r\nthe appetite is excellent, and the spirits good.\r\n\r\n16th'. The cough is still less frequent, but when it occurs it is\r\nattended with retching.\r\n\r\n19th'. The cough is daily getting better, and is not heard more than\r\nthree or four times in the four-and-twenty hours, and then very slight.\r\n\r\n30th'. At length I can say that the cough has ceased. It is seldom that\r\nso much trouble would have been taken with a dog. It is the neglect of\r\nthe medical attendance which is often the cause of death. Professor\r\nDelafond, of Alfort, gives a most interesting and complete table of the\r\nusual diagnostic symptoms of pleurisy and pneumonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURISY.\r\n\r\n'Commencement of the Inflammation'.\r\nShivering, usually accompanied by slight colicky pains, and followed by\r\ngeneral or partial sweating. Inspiration always short, unequal, and\r\ninterrupted; expiration full; air expired of the natural temperature.\r\nCough unfrequent, faint, short, and without expectoration. Artery full.\r\nPulse quick, small, and wiry.\r\n\r\n'Auscultation'.\r\nA respiratory murmur, feeble, or accompanied by a slight rubbing through\r\nthe whole extent of the chest, or in some parts only.\r\n\r\n'Percussion'.\r\nSlight, dead, grating sound. Distinct resonance through the whole of the\r\nchest, and pain expressed when the sides are tapped or compressed.\r\n\r\n'Terminations'\r\nDelitescence. Cessation of pain; moderate temperature of the skin;\r\nsometimes profuse general perspiration. Respiration less accelerated;\r\ninspiration easier and deeper. Pulse fuller and softer. Breath of the\r\nnatural temperature. Return of the natural respiratory murmur and\r\nresonance.  The walls of the chest cease to exhibit increased\r\nsensibility.\r\n\r\n'Effusion, false Membranes'.\r\nInspiration more and more full.\r\n\r\n'Auscultation and Percussion.\r\nComplete absence of the respiratory murmur, with the crepitating\r\nwheezing always at the bottom of the chest; sometimes a gurgling noise.\r\nVesicular respiration very strong in the upper region of the chest, or\r\nin the sac opposite to the effusion.\r\n\r\n'Continuance of the Effusion'.\r\nAbsence of the respiratory murmur gains the middle region of the chest,\r\nfollowing the level of the fluid. These symptoms may be found on only\r\none side; a circumstance of frequent occurrence in the dog, but rare in\r\nother animals. The respiratory murmur increases in the superior region\r\nof the chest, or on the side opposite to the effusion. Inspiration\r\nbecomes more and more prolonged. Breath always cold. Cough not existing,\r\nor rarely, and always suppressed and interrupted. Exercise producing much\r\ndifficulty of respiration.\r\n\r\n'Resolution or Re-absorption of the effused fluid, and Organization of\r\nfalse Membrane, the consequence of Pleurisy'.\r\n\r\nSlow but progressive reappearance of the respiratory murmur, and\r\ndisappearance of the sounds produced by the fluid. Diminution of the\r\nforce of the respiratory murmur in the superior part of the chest, or of\r\nthe lung opposite to the sac in which the effusion exists. Gradual\r\nreturn of the respiratory murmur to the inferior part of the chest.\r\nInspiration less deep, and returning to its natural state.\r\n\r\n'Chronic Pleurisy, with Hydrothorax'.\r\nInspiration short. Cough dry, sometimes with expectoration; frequent or\r\ncapricious; always absence of complete respiratory murmur in the\r\ninferior portion of the chest. Sometimes the gurgling noise during\r\ninspiration and expiration. Strong respiratory murmur in the superior\r\nportion. In dogs these symptoms sometimes have existence only on one\r\nside of the chest. The mucous membranes are infiltrated; serous\r\ninfiltration on the lower part of the chest and belly; sometimes of the\r\nscrotum or the inferior extremities; generally of the fore legs. The\r\nanimal lies down frequently, and dies of suffocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\n'Commencement of the Inflammation'.\r\nGeneral shivering, rarely accompanied by colicky pains, followed by\r\npartial sweats at the flanks and the inside of the thighs. Inspiration\r\nfull, expiration short. Air expired hot. Cough frequently followed by\r\nslight discharge of red-coloured mucus. Artery full. Pulse accelerated,\r\nstrong, full, and soft.\r\n\r\n'Auscultation'.\r\nAbsence of respiratory murmur in places where the lung is congested;\r\nfeebleness of that sound in the inflamed parts, with humid crepitating\r\nwheezing. The respiratory murmur increased in the sound parts.\r\n\r\n'Percussion'.\r\nThe dead grating sound confined to the inflamed parts. Distinct\r\nresonance at the sound parts; increased sensibility of the walls of the\r\nchest slight, or not existing at all.\r\n\r\n'Terminations'.\r\nResolution. Temperature of the skin moderate. Sometimes profuse partial\r\nsweats. Laborious respiration subsiding; inspiration less deep. Artery\r\nless full. Pulse yielding. Breath less hot. Gradual and progressive\r\ndisappearance of the crepitating 'râle'. Slow return of the resonance.\r\n\r\n'Red Hepatization'.\r\nRespiration irregular and interrupted.\r\n\r\n'Auscultation and Percussion.\r\nCircumscribed absence of the respiratory murmur, in one point, or in\r\nmany distinct parts of the lung. The respiratory murmur increased in one\r\nor more of the sound parts of the lung, or in the sound lung if one is\r\ninflamed.\r\n\r\n'Passage to a State of Gray Induration'.\r\nThe absence of respiratory murmur indicates extensive hepatization of\r\none lung; a circumstance, however, of rare occurrence. When the\r\ninduration is of both lungs, and equally so, the respiratory murmur and\r\nthe inspiration remain the same, except that they become irregular. The\r\ncough dry or humid, frequent, and sometimes varying.  Exercise\r\naccompanied by difficulty of respiration, without dyspnoea.\r\n\r\n'Resolution or Re-absorption of the Products of Inflammation of the\r\nParenchymatous Substance of the Lungs'.\r\n\r\nDiminution of the force of the respiratory murmur in the sound parts.\r\nCessation of the crepitating wheezing. Slow return of the respiratory\r\nmurmur where it had ceased. Respiration ceases to be irregular or\r\ninterrupted, and returns slowly to its natural state, or it remains\r\ninterrupted. This indicates the passage from red to gray induration.\r\n\r\n'Chronic Pneumonia--(Gray Induration.)'\r\nInspiration or expiration interrupted, cough unfrequent; suppressed;\r\nrarely with expectoration; always interrupted. Complete absence of\r\nrespiratory murmur.\r\n\r\n'Softening of the Induration, Ulcerations, Vomicæ, &c.'\r\nMucous and wheezing; mucous râle in the bronchia; discharge from the\r\nnostrils of purulent matter, white, gray, or black, and sometimes fetid.\r\nPaleness of the mucous membranes. The animal seldom lies down, and never\r\nlong at a time. Death by suffocation, when the matter proceeding from\r\nthe vomicæ, or abscesses, obstructs the bronchial passages, or by the\r\ndevelopment of an acute inflammation engrafted upon the chronic one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nANATOMY OF THE GULLET, STOMACH, AND INTESTINES: TETANUS; ENTERITIS;\r\nPERITONITIS; COLIC; CALCULUS IN THE INTESTINES: INTUSSUSCEPTION;\r\nDIARRHOEA; DYSENTERY; COSTIVENESS; DROPSY; THE LIVER; JAUNDICE; THE\r\nSPLEEN AND PANCREAS; INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEY; CALCULUS; INFLAMMATION\r\nOF THE BLADDER; RUPTURE OF THE BLADDER; WORMS: FISTULA IN THE ANUS.\r\n\r\nThe 'oesophagus', or gullet, of the dog, is constructed in nearly the\r\nsame manner as that of the horse. It consists of a similar muscular tube\r\npassing down the neck and through the chest, and terminating in the\r\nstomach, in which the process of digestion is commenced. The orifice by\r\nwhich the gullet enters the stomach is termed the 'cardia', probably on\r\naccount of its neighbourhood to the heart or its sympathy with it. It is\r\nconstantly closed, except when the food is passing through it into the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nThe 'stomach' has three coats: the outermost, which is the common\r\ncovering of all the intestines, called the peritoneum; the second or\r\nmuscular coat, consisting of two layers of fibres, by which a constant\r\nmotion is communicated to the stomach, mingling the food, and preparing\r\nit for digestion; and the mucous or villous, where the work of digestion\r\nproperly commences, the mouths of numerous little vessels opening upon\r\nit, which exude the gastric juice, to mix with the food already\r\nsoftened, and to convert it into a fluid called the chyme. It is a\r\nsimpler apparatus than in the horse or in cattle. It is occasionally the\r\nprimary seat of inflammation: and it almost invariably sympathises with\r\nthe affections of the other intestines.\r\n\r\nThe successive contractions of each portion of the stomach, expose by\r\nturns every portion of the alimentary mass to the influence of the\r\ngastric juice, and each is gradually discharged into the alimentary\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nAs the chyme is formed, it passes out of the other orifice of the\r\nstomach, and enters the first intestine or 'duodenum'.\r\n\r\nIt may be naturally supposed that this process will occasionally be\r\ninterrupted by a variety of circumstances. Inflammation of the stomach\r\nof the dog is very difficult to deal with. It is produced by numerous\r\ndifferent causes. There is great and long-continued sickness; even the\r\nmost harmless medicine is not retained on the stomach. The thirst is\r\nexcessive; there are evident indications of excessive pain, expressed by\r\nthe countenance and by groans: there is a singular disposition in the\r\nanimal to hide himself from all observation; an indication that should\r\nnever be neglected, nor the frequent change from heat to cold, and from\r\ncold to heat.\r\n\r\nThe mode of treatment is simple, although too often inefficient. The\r\nlancet must be immediately resorted to, and the bleeding continued until\r\nthe animal seems about to fall; and to this should quickly succeed\r\nrepeated injections. Two or three drops of the croton oil should be\r\ninjected twice or thrice in the day, until the bowels are thoroughly\r\nopened. The animal will be considerably better, or the disease cured, in\r\nthe course of a couple of days.\r\n\r\nThere is a singular aptitude in the stomach of the dog to eject a\r\nportion of its contents; but, almost immediately afterwards, the food,\r\nor a portion if not the whole of it, is swallowed again. This is a\r\nmatter of daily occurrence. There is a coarse rough grass, the\r\n'cynosurus cristatus', or crested dog's-tail. It is inferior for the\r\npurposes of hay, but is admirably suited for permanent pastures. It\r\nremains green after most other grasses are burnt by a continuance of dry\r\nweather. The dog, if it be in his power, has frequent recourse to it,\r\nespecially if he lives mostly in a town. The dry and stimulating food,\r\nwhich generally falls to his share, produces an irritation of his\r\nstomach, from which lie is glad to free himself; and for this purpose he\r\nhas recourse to the sharp leaves of the cynosurus. They irritate the\r\nlining membrane of the stomach and intestines, and cause a portion of\r\nthe food to be occasionally evacuated; acting either as an emetic or a\r\npurgative, or both. They seem to be designed by nature to be substituted\r\nfor the calomel and tartar emetic, and other drugs, which are far too\r\noften introduced.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of the retention of a sharp instrument in the\r\nstomach is related by Mr. Kent of Bristol.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of February, Mr. Harford, residing in Bristol, when feeding a\r\npointer-dog, happened to let the fork tumble with the flesh, and the dog\r\nswallowed them both. On the following morning, Mr. Kent was desired to\r\nsee the animal; and, although he could feel the projection of the fork\r\noutwardly, which convinced him that the dog had in reality swallowed it,\r\nyet, as he appeared well, and exhibited no particular symptoms of pain\r\nor fever, Mr. Kent gave it as his opinion that there was a possibility\r\nthat he might survive the danger, and the animal was sent to him, in\r\norder to be more immediately under his care. The treatment he adopted\r\nwas, to feed him on cow's liver, with a view to keep the stomach\r\ndistended and the bowels open; and he gave him three times a day half a\r\npint of water, with sufficient sulphuric acid to make it rather strongly\r\nsour to the human tongue, with the intention of assisting the stomach in\r\ndissolving the iron.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday, the skin, at the projecting point, began to\r\nexhibit some indication of ulceration; and on Monday a prong of the fork\r\nmight be touched with the point of the finger, when pressed on the\r\nulcer. Mr. Kent then determined on making an effort to extract the fork\r\non the following morning, which he accordingly did, and with but little\r\ndifficulty, assisted by a medical friend of the owner. The dog was still\r\nfed on cow's liver; his appetite remained good, and with very little\r\nmedical treatment the external wound healed. The animal improved rapidly\r\nin flesh during the whole time. He left the infirmary in perfect health,\r\nand remained so, with one inconvenience only, a very bad cough, and his\r\nbeing obliged to lie at length, being unable to coil himself up in his\r\nusual way.\r\n\r\nThe fork was a three-pronged one, six and a half inches long. The\r\nhandle, which was of ivory, was digested: it was quite gone; and either\r\nthe gastric fluid or the acid, or both conjointly, had made a very\r\napparent impression on the iron.\r\n\r\nDogs occasionally swallow various strange and unnatural substances.\r\nConsiderable quantities of hair are sometimes accumulated in the\r\nstomach. Half-masticated pieces of straw are ejected. Straw mingled with\r\ndung is a too convincing proof of rabies. Dog-grass is found irritating\r\nthe stomach, or in too great quantities to be ejected, while collections\r\nof earth and dung sometimes threaten suffocation. Pieces of money are\r\noccasionally found, and lead, and sponge. Various species of polypus\r\nirritate the coats of the stomach. Portions of chalk, or stone, or\r\ncondensed matters, adhere to each other, and masses of strange\r\nconsistence and form are collected. The size which they assume increases\r\nmore and more. M. Galy relates an extraordinary account of a dog. It was\r\nabout three years old when a tumour began to be perceived in the flank.\r\nSome sharp-pointed substance was felt; the veterinary surgeon cut down\r\nupon it, and a piece of iron, six inches in length, was drawn out.\r\n\r\nThe following fact was more extraordinary: it is related by M. Noiret. A\r\nhound swallowed a bone, which rested in the superior part of the\r\noesophagus, behind the pharynx, and caused the most violent efforts to\r\nget rid of it. The only means by which it could be made to descend into\r\nthe stomach was by pushing it with the handle of a fork, which, escaping\r\nfrom the hand of the operator, followed the bone into the stomach. Two\r\nmonths afterwards, on examining the stomach, the fork was plainly felt\r\nlying in a longitudinal direction, parallel with the position of the\r\nbody; the owner of the dog wishing mechanically to accelerate the\r\nexpulsion of this body, endeavoured to push it backwards with his hands.\r\nWhen it was drawn as far back as possible, he inserted two fingers into\r\nthe anus, and succeeded in getting hold of the handle, which he drew out\r\nnearly an inch; but, in order to be enabled fully to effect his object,\r\nit was necessary to make an incision into the rectum, and free the\r\nsubstance from every obstacle that could retain it. This he did not\r\nventure to do, and he was therefore compelled to allow the fork to pass\r\nback into its former position.\r\n\r\nAbout three months after the accident, M. Noiret made an incision, three\r\ninches from above to below, and the same from the front backwards. He\r\nalso made an incision through the muscular tissue. Having arrived at the\r\nperitoneum, he made another incision, through which he drew from the\r\nabdomen a part of the floating portion of the large intestines, and\r\nintroduced his fingers into the abdominal cavity. He seized the handle\r\nof the fork, which was among the viscera, and free about half-way down,\r\nand drew it carefully towards the opening made in the flank. The other\r\nhalf of the fork was found to be closely enveloped by the origin of the\r\nmesocolon, which was red, hard, and inflamed. The operator freed it by\r\ncutting through the tissues which held the fork, and then drew it easily\r\nout. The animal was submitted to a proper course of treatment, and in\r\nthree weeks afterwards was perfectly cured.\r\n\r\nThe food, having been converted into chyme by the digestive power of the\r\nstomach, soon undergoes another and very important change. It, or a\r\nportion of it, is converted into chyle. It is mixed with the bile and a\r\nsecretion from the pancreas in the duodenum. The white thick liquid is\r\nseparated, and contains the nutritive part of the food, and a yellow\r\npulpy substance is gradually changed into excrement. As these substances\r\npass on, the separation between them becomes more and more complete. The\r\nchyle is gradually taken up by the lacteals, and the excrement alone\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nThe next of the small intestines is the 'jejunum', so called from its\r\nbeing generally empty. It is smaller in bulk than the duodenum, and the\r\nchyme passes rapidly through it.\r\n\r\nNext in the list is the 'ileum'; but it is difficult to say where the\r\njejunum terminates and the ileum commences, except that the latter is\r\nusually one-fifth longer than the former.\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the ileum the 'cæcum' makes its appearance, with\r\na kind of valvular opening into it, of such a nature that everything\r\nthat passes along it having reached the blind or closed end, must return\r\nin order to escape; or rather the office of the cæcum is to permit\r\ncertain alimentary matters and all fluids to pass from the ileum, but to\r\noppose their return.\r\n\r\nThe 'colon' is an intestine of very large size, being one of the most\r\ncapacious, as well as one of the longest, of the large intestines. It\r\ncommences at the cæsum caput coli, and soon expands into a cavity of\r\ngreater dimensions than even that of the stomach itself. Having attained\r\nthis singular bulk, it begins to contract, and continues to do so during\r\nits course round the cæcum, until it has completed its second flexure,\r\nwhere it grows so small as scarcely to exceed in calibre one of the\r\nsmall intestines; and though, from about the middle of this turn, it\r\nagain swells out by degrees, it never afterwards acquires its former\r\ncapaciousness; indeed, previously to its junction with the rectum, it\r\nonce more materially differs in size.\r\n\r\nAt the upper part of the margin of the pelvis the colon terminates in\r\nthe 'rectum', which differs from the cæcum and colon by possessing only\r\na partial peritoneal covering, and being destitute of bands and cells.\r\nIt enlarges towards its posterior extremity, and is furnished with a\r\ncircular muscle, the sphincter ani, adapted to preserve the anus closed,\r\nand to retain the fæculent matter until so much of it is accumulated in\r\nthe rectum as to excite a desire to discharge it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTETANUS,\r\n\r\na disease of great fatality, often depends upon the condition of the\r\nstomach; but it is not frequent in dogs.\r\n\r\nWhy the dog is so little subject to 'tetanus', or lock-jaw, I am unable\r\nto explain. Sportsmen say that it sometimes attacks him when, being\r\nheated in the chase, he plunges into the water after the stag. The\r\nFrench give it the name of 'mal de cerf', from stags being supposed to\r\nbe attacked in a similar way, and from the same cause. In the course of\r\nnearly forty years' practice, I have seen but four cases of it. The\r\nfirst arose from a wound in the foot. The cause of the second I could\r\nnot learn. In both the spasmodic action was dreadful as well as\r\nuniversal. The dogs lay on their sides, the neck and legs stretched out,\r\nand the upper legs kept some inches from the ground by the intensity of\r\nthe spasm. They might be taken up by either leg, and not a portion of\r\nthe frame change its direction. At the same time, in their countenances,\r\nand by their hoarse cries, they indicated the torture which they\r\nendured.\r\n\r\nIn the third case, which occurred 12th June, 1822, the head was drawn\r\npermanently on one side, and the whole body formed a kind of bow, the\r\ndog walking curiously sideways, often falling as it walked, and\r\nfrequently screaming violently. I ordered him to be well rubbed with an\r\nammoniacal liniment, and balls of tonic and purging medicine to be given\r\ntwice in the day. The dog gradually recovered, and was dismissed cured\r\non the 20th.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th November, in the same year, a bull-terrier had a similar\r\ncomplaint. He had been tried in the pit a fortnight before, and severely\r\ninjured, and the pain and stiffness of his joints were increasing. The\r\nhead was now permanently drawn on one side. The dog was unable to stand\r\neven for a moment, and the eyes were in a state of spasmodic motion. He\r\nwas a most savage brute; but I attempted to manage him, and, by the\r\nassistance of the owner, contrived lo bleed him, and to give him a\r\nphysic-ball. At the same time I advised that he should be destroyed.\r\n\r\nHis master would not consent to this; and, as the dog occasionally ate a\r\nlittle, we contrived to give a grain each of calomel and opium every\r\nsixth hour. In the course of three days he was materially recovered. He\r\ncould stand, but was exceedingly weak, I ordered the calomel lo be\r\nomitted, but the opium to be continued. Three days afterwards he was\r\nsent into the country, and, as I heard, perfectly recovered.\r\n\r\nThe following is a very interesting case of tetanus, detailed by M.\r\nDebeaux, of the Royal French Chasseurs:\r\n\r\nA favourite dog was missing. Four days had passed, and no intelligence\r\ncould be obtained with regard to him until he returned home, fatigued\r\nand half-starved. He had probably been stolen. In the excess of their\r\njoy, the owners crammed him with meat until he became strangely ill. His\r\nthroat was filled with froth, the pupils of his eyes were dilated, the\r\nconjunctiva was strongly injected, his neck was spasmodically\r\ncontracted, and the spine of the back was bowed, and most highly\r\nsensible to the touch. M. Debeaux was sent for; it was an hour before he\r\ncould attend. The dog was lying on his belly; the four limbs were\r\nextended and stiff. He uttered the most dreadful and prolonged howling\r\nevery two or three minutes. The surgeon ordered the application of a\r\ndozen leeches to the chest and belly; laxative medicines were given, and\r\nembrocations applied to the spine and back.\r\n\r\nThree days passed, and the symptoms evidently augmented. The excrement\r\nwas dark and fetid, and the conjunctiva had a strong yellow tint.\r\nLeeches were again employed; emollient lotions and aperient medicines\r\nwere resorted to. The sensibility of the spine and back was worse than\r\never; the animal lay on his belly, stretching out his four limbs, his\r\nneck fixed, his jaws immovable, his voice hoarse, and he was utterly\r\nunable to move.\r\n\r\nThe bathings, lotions, and aperients were continued, with very few\r\nintermissions, until the 14th day, when the muscles began to be a little\r\nrelaxed; but he cried whenever he was touched. On the 15th, for the\r\nfirst time, he began to eat a little, and his natural voice returned;\r\nstill, however, the spasms occasionally appeared, but very much\r\nmitigated, and on the 20th the pain had entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of the next month he travelled two leagues with his master.\r\nIt was cold, and the snow fell. On his reaching home, all the horrible\r\nspasms returned, and it was eleven days before he was completely cured.\r\n[1]\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine gives the following account of his experience of this disease:\r\n\r\n  \"It is remarkable, that although dogs are subject to various spasmodic\r\n  affections, yet they are so little subject to lock-jaw that I never\r\n  met with more than three cases of it among many thousands of diseased\r\n  dogs. Two of these cases were 'idiopathic'; one being apparently\r\n  occasioned by exposure to cold air all night; the other the cause was\r\n  obscure. The third was of that kind called 'sympathetic', and arose\r\n  from extreme injury done to one of the feet. In each of these cases\r\n  the convulsive spasm was extreme, and the rigidity universal but not\r\n  intense. In one case the jaw was only partially locked. Both warm and\r\n  cold bathings were tried. Large doses of opium and camphor were given\r\n  by the mouth, and also thrown up in clysters. The spine of one was\r\n  blistered. Stimulating frictions were applied to all, but in neither\r\n  case with any salutary effect.\" [2]\r\n\r\n\r\nENTERITIS.\r\n\r\n'Enteritis', or inflammation of the intestine, is a disease to which\r\ndogs are very liable. It may be produced by the action of several\r\ncauses. The intestines of the dog are peculiarly irritable, and subject\r\nto take on inflammatory action, and this tendency is often much\r\nincreased by the artificial life which they lead. It is a very frequent\r\ncomplaint among those dogs that are much petted. A cold temperature is\r\nalso a common cause of disease in these dogs.\r\n\r\nI was consulted with regard to a dog who was hiding himself in a cold,\r\ndark corner, paved with stone. Every now and then he lifted his head and\r\nuttered a howl closely resembling that of a rabid dog. He fixed his gaze\r\nintently upon me, with a peculiarity of expression which many would have\r\nmistaken for rabid. They, however, who have had the opportunity of\r\nseeing many of these cases, will readily perceive the difference. The\r\nconjunctiva is not so red, the pupil is not so dilated, and the dog\r\nappears to implore pity and not to menace evil.\r\n\r\nIn this state, if the dog is approached, he will not permit himself to\r\nbe touched until he he convinced that no harm is intended. A peculiar\r\nslowness attends each motion; his cries are frequent and piteous; his\r\nbelly hot and tender; two cords, in many cases, seem to run\r\nlongitudinally from the chest to the pubis, and on these he cannot bear\r\nthe slightest pressure. He abhors all food; but his thirst for water,\r\nand particularly cold water, is extreme; he frequently looks round at\r\nhis flanks, and the lingering gaze is terminated by a cry or groan. In\r\nthe majority of cases there is considerable costiveness; but, in others,\r\nthe bowels are freely opened from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneal inflammation is sometimes pure, but oftener involves the\r\nmuscular coat of the intestines. Its prevailing cause is exposure to\r\ncold, especially after fatigue, of lying on the wet stones or grass. Now\r\nand then it is the result of neglected rheumatism, especially in old and\r\npetted dogs.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is simple. Bleed until the pulse falters, put the animal\r\nin a warm bath, and let the belly be gently rubbed while the dog is in\r\nthe water, and well fomented afterwards; the drink should consist of\r\nwarm broth, or warm milk and water. The bleeding should be repeated, if\r\nlittle or unsatisfactory relief is obtained; and the examination of the\r\nrectum with the finger, and the removal of any hardened fæces that may\r\nhave accumulated there, and the cautious use of enemata, neither too\r\nstimulating nor too forcibly injected, should be resorted to. No\r\nmedicine should be employed until the most urgent symptoms are abated.\r\nCastor oil, the mildest of our purgatives--syrup of buckthorn assisting\r\nthe purgative property of the oil, and containing in its composition as\r\nmuch stimulating power as is safe--and the spirit of while poppies--the\r\nmost convenient anodyne to mingle with the other medicines--will\r\ngenerally be successful in allaying the irritation already existing, and\r\npreventing the development of more. Even this must not be given in too\r\nlarge quantities, and the effect must be assisted by a repetition of the\r\nenemata every fifth or sixth hour. On examination after death the nature\r\nof the disease is sufficiently evident: the peritoneum, or portions of\r\nit, is highly injected with blood, the veins are turgid, the muscular\r\nmembrane corrugated and hardened, while often the mucous membrane\r\ndisplays not a trace of disease. In violent cases, however, the whole of\r\nthe intestines exhibit evidence of inflammation.\r\n\r\nI was much gratified a few years ago in witnessing the decided manner in\r\nwhich Professor Spooner expressed himself with regard to the treatment\r\nof enteritis in the dog.\r\n\r\n  \"I should deem it advisable,\" said he, \"to administer a purgative; but\r\n  of what would that consist? Calomel? Certainly not. I was surprised to\r\n  hear one gentleman assert that he should administer it to the extent\r\n  of from five to ten grains, and another to say that he should not\r\n  hesitate to exhibit a scruple of calomel to a dog, and to all\r\n  carnivorous animals. I should never think of exhibiting it as a\r\n  cathartic. I should only administer it in small doses, and for the\r\n  purpose of producing its specific effect on the liver, which is the\r\n  peculiar property of this drug. Given in larger doses it would not be\r\n  retained, and if it got into the intestines it would act as a powerful\r\n  drastic purgative.\" [3]\r\n\r\nIn our treatment of the horse we have got rid of a great proportion of\r\nthe destructive urine-balls and drastic purgatives of the farrier. The\r\ncow is no longer drenched with half-a-dozen deleterious stimulants. A\r\nmost desirable change has been effected in the medical treatment of\r\nthese animals. Let us not, with regard to the dog, continue to pursue\r\nthe destructive course of the keeper or the huntsman.\r\n\r\nThe following case of enteritis, with rupture of the colon, may be\r\nuseful:\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 1840, I was requested to attend a large dog of the bull\r\nbreed, three years old, who had not appeared to be well during the last\r\nfour or five days.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely arrived ere I recognised it to be a case of enteritis. He\r\nhad a dreadful shivering fit, to which succeeded heat of the skin and\r\nrestlessness. The muzzle was dry and hot, as also was the tongue. The\r\neyes were sunken and redder than usual; the breathing was accelerated,\r\nbut not very laborious; the extremities were cold, while the surface of\r\nthe body was hot and painful to the touch. The bowels were constipated,\r\nand had been so during the last week; some dung however was evacuated,\r\nbut it was hard and dry, and in small quantities. The pulse was quick,\r\nbut full; and there was a slight pain and considerable irritation in the\r\nrectum. I took from him [Symbol: ounce] x. of blood before the desired\r\neffect was produced, and then gave him tinct. opii gr. xiv., et spt.\r\nether, nit. gutt. viij., cum ol. ricini [Symbol: ounce] iij., and an\r\nopiate enema to allay the irritation of the rectum. This was about 8\r\no'clock, A.M.\r\n\r\n11 A.M.--The bowels have not been moved, and the pain is more intense;\r\nhis countenance expresses great anxiety; he frequently lies on his\r\nstomach, and the pulse is small but quick. I gave him a little broth,\r\nand ordered the abdomen to be fomented with hot flannels.\r\n\r\n2 P.M.--He has had distressing sickness, and is extremely anxious for\r\nwater. I introduced my finger into the rectum, but could not discover\r\nany hardened fæces. Enemata, composed of mag. sulphas and warm water,\r\nwere frequently thrown into the intestines; as soon as one came away\r\nanother was thrown up.\r\n\r\n4 P.M.--No better: gave him pulv. aloes [Symbol: ounce] j.; calomel, gr.\r\nvj. et pulv. opii gr. viij. The fomentations to be continued, and the\r\nabdomen rubbed with a lin. terebinthinæ.\r\n\r\n5 P.M.--A great change has taken place within the last hour; the hind\r\nextremities are paralysed; the mouth and ears are cold; the pulse is\r\nmore hurried and irregular, and almost imperceptible; the respiration is\r\nlaborious and irregular, as is the pulse; and the dog is frequently\r\nsick.  To be kept quiet.\r\n\r\n6 P.M.--Another change: he lies panting and groaning piteously; his\r\nlimbs are bathed in sweat, with convulsive struggles. At twenty minutes\r\npast six he died.\r\n\r\nA post-mortem examination presented general marks of inflammation; the\r\nsmall intestines were extremely red, while the large ones were in a\r\ngangrenous state and most offensive, with a rupture of the colon. I did\r\nnot expect to meet with the rupture, and am at a loss to account for it.\r\nThe liver was of a pale ashen colour, and very light. I put a piece of\r\nit into some water, and it floated on the surface. The other contents of\r\nthe abdomen did not show the slightest appearance of disease.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2d, 1843.--A black pug-bitch, 18 months old, was yesterday\r\ntaken violently sick; the vomiting continued at intervals the greater\r\npart of the day, and she had not eaten during the last 24 hours. I could\r\nnot possibly get at her, on account of her ferocity: as she had not had\r\nthe distemper, and as I was misled by her age and the watery discharge\r\nfrom her eyes, and as she had had several motions yesterday, I imagined\r\nthat the attack might be the beginning of that disease. Learning that\r\nshe was fond of sweet things, I prepared an emetic containing a grain of\r\ncalomel and a grain of tartar emetic: she took it readily, and I\r\npromised to call on the following day.\r\n\r\nSept. 3.--The weakness at the eyes had disappeared, but there had been\r\nno motion. On getting at her by main force I found her belly very tense\r\nand rather hot: she had again been sick, was very eager for water, and\r\nstill refused to eat. The disease was now evident. As she appeared too\r\nunmanageable for anything else, I produced a physic-ball, in giving\r\nwhich I was bitten.\r\n\r\nSix hours afterwards I again went: no fæces had passed: I administered\r\ntwo enemas, the second of which was returned with a small quantity of\r\nhardened fæces and an intolerable smell. I ordered the water to be\r\nremoved, and broth to be substituted.\r\n\r\nSept. 4.--The dog is in good spirits, has eaten heartily, and had no\r\nmotion, probably because it was habitually cleanly, and had not been\r\ntaken out of doors. Her owner considered her as quite well, and\r\ndismissed me. Three days afterwards a servant came to say that all was\r\ngoing on very well.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERITONITIS.\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation of the 'peritoneal membrane' is a frequent disease\r\namong dogs. The animal loses his appetite and spirits; he sometimes eats\r\na little and sometimes not; he becomes thin, his belly is tucked up, and\r\nwhen we closely examine him we find it contracted and hard, and those\r\nlongitudinal columns of which I have already spoken are peculiarly dense\r\nand almost unyielding. He now and then utters a half-suppressed whine,\r\nand he occasionally seeks to hide himself. In the greater number of\r\ncases he after a while recovers; but he too often pines away and dies.\r\nOn examination after death the case is plain enough. There is\r\ninflammation of the peritoneal membrane, more indicated by undue\r\ncongestion of the bowels than by the general blush of the membrane. The\r\ninflammation has now spread to the muscular coat, and the whole of the\r\nintestine is corrugated and thickened.\r\n\r\nThere is another peritoneal affection, aggravated by combination with a\r\nrheumatic tendency, to which the dog is more disposed than any other\r\ndomesticated animal. It has its most frequent origin in cold, or being\r\ntoo much fed on stimulating and acrid food, and probably from other\r\ncauses which have not yet been sufficiently developed.\r\n\r\nHere also no drastic purgative is to be admitted; it would be adding\r\nfuel to fire: not a grain of calomel should be used, if the life of the\r\nanimal is valued. The castor oil mixture will afford the most certain\r\nrelief, a drop or two of the oil of peppermint being added to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLIC.\r\n\r\nThe dog is also subject to fits of 'colic', principally to be traced to\r\nimproper food, or a sudden change of food, or exposure to cold. This is\r\nparticularly the case with puppies. There is no redness of the eye, no\r\nheat of the mouth, no quickened respiration; but the animal labours\r\nunder fits of pain. He is not quiet for a minute. He gets into one\r\ncorner and another, curling himself closely up, but he does not lie\r\nthere more than a minute or two; another fit of pain comes on; he utters\r\nhis peculiar yelp, and seeks some new place in which he may possibly\r\nfind rest.\r\n\r\nIt is with considerable diffidence that I offer an opinion on this\r\nsubject contrary to that of Mr. Blaine. He states that the treatment of\r\nthis species of colic is seldom successful, and that which has seemed\r\nthe most efficacious has been mercurial purgatives; namely, calomel one\r\ngrain, aloes a scruple, and opium a quarter of a grain, until the bowels\r\nare opened. I have seldom found much difficulty in relieving the patient\r\nsuffering under this affection; and I gave no aloes nor calomel, but the\r\noleaginous mixture to which I have so often referred. I should not so\r\nmuch object to the aloes, for they constitute an excellent purgative for\r\nthe dog; nor to a dog that I was preparing for work, or that was\r\nsuffering from worms, should I object to two or three grains of calomel\r\nintimately mixed with the aloes: from the combined effect of the two,\r\nsome good might be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCULUS IN THE INTESTINES\r\n\r\nMany persons have a very foolish custom of throwing stones, that their\r\ndogs may dive or run after them, and bring them to their owner's feet:\r\nthe consequence is, that their teeth are soon worn down, and there are\r\ntoo many cases on record in which the stone has been swallowed. It has\r\nbeen impeded in its progress through the intestinal canal, inflammation\r\nhas ensued, and the animal has been lost, after having suffered the most\r\ndreadful torture.\r\n\r\nProfessor Simonds relates a case in which a dog was thus destroyed. The\r\nanimal for some days previous to his admission into the hospital had\r\nrefused his food, and there was obstinate constipation of the bowels, to\r\nremove which aperient medicine had been given. The pulse was\r\naccelerated, there was distension of the abdomen with evident tenderness\r\non pressure, the extremities were cold, no fæces were voided, and he\r\noccasionally vomited. Some aperient medicine was given, which was\r\nretained on the stomach, and enemas and external stimulants were\r\nresorted to, but two days afterwards he died.\r\n\r\nThe intestines were examined, and the offending body was found to be a\r\ncommon pebble. The dog had long been accustomed to fetch stones out of\r\nthe water. One of these stones had passed through the stomach into the\r\nintestines, and, after proceeding some distance along them, had been\r\nimpacted there. The inflammation was most intense so far as the stone\r\nhad gone; but in the part of the intestine to which it had not reached\r\nthere was not any. This was an interesting and instructive case, and\r\nshould make its due impression.\r\n\r\nAnother account of the strange contents of the intestines of a bitch may\r\nbe here introduced.\r\n\r\nA valuable pointer-bitch was sent to the infirmary of Mr. Godwin of\r\nLitchfield. She presented a very emaciated appearance, and had done so\r\nfor four or five months. Her evacuations for a day or two were very thin\r\nand copious, and afterwards for several days nothing was passed. When\r\npressing the abdomen with both hands, a hard substance was distinctly\r\nfelt in the inferior part of the umbilical region. She was destroyed,\r\nand, upon 'post-mortem' examination, a calculus was discovered in the\r\nileum about the size and shape of a hen's egg, the nucleus of which was\r\na portion of hair. The coats of the intestines were considerably\r\nthickened and enlarged, so as to form a kind of sac for its retention.\r\nAnterior to this was another substance, consisting of a ball of hair,\r\ncovered with a layer of earthy matter about the eighth of an inch thick,\r\nand next to this another ball of hair of less dimensions, intermixed\r\nwith a gritty substance. The stomach contained a large quantity of hair,\r\nand a portion of the omentum, about the size of n crown piece, was\r\nthickly studded with small white calculi, the largest about the size of\r\na pea, and exceedingly hard.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTUSSUSCEPTION.\r\n\r\nIf 'peritonitis'--inflammation--is neglected, or drastic purgatives are\r\ntoo often and too plentifully administered, a peculiar contraction of\r\nthe muscular membrane of the intestine takes place, and one portion of\r\nthe bowel is received within another--there is 'intussusception'. In\r\nmost cases, a portion of the anterior intestine is received into that\r\nwhich is posterior to it. Few of us have opened a dog that had been\r\nlabouring under this peculiar affection without being struck with the\r\ncollapsed state of the canal in various parts, and in some much more\r\nthan in others. Immediately posterior to this collapsed portion, it is\r\nwidened to a considerable extent. The peristaltic motion of the\r\nintestine goes on, and the consequence is, that the constricted portion\r\nis received into that which is widened, the anterior portion is\r\ninvaginated in the posterior: obstruction of the intestinal passage is\r\nthe necessary consequence, and the animal dies, either from the general\r\ndisturbance of the system which ensues, or the inflammation which is set\r\nup in the invaginated part.\r\n\r\nI will say nothing of medical treatment in this case; for I do not know\r\nthe symptoms of intussusception, or how it is to be distinguished from\r\nacute inflammation of the bowels. Acute inflammation will not long exist\r\nwithout producing it; and, if its existence should be strongly\r\nsuspected, the treatment would be the same as for inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe domesticated dog, from the nature of his food, more than from any\r\nconstitutional tendency, is liable to constipation. This should never be\r\nneglected. If two or three days should pass without an evacuation, the\r\ncase should be taken in hand; otherwise inflammation will be very soon\r\nestablished. In order to procure an evacuation, the aloetic ball, with\r\none or two grains of calomel, should be given. Beyond that, however, I\r\nshould not dare to go; but, if the constipation continued, I should have\r\nrecourse to the castor-oil mixture. I should previously examine and\r\nempty the rectum, and have frequent recourse to the enema-syringe; and I\r\nshould continue both. It would be my object to evacuate the intestinal\r\ncanal with as little increased action as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA\r\n\r\nis the discharge of fæces more frequently than usual, and thinner than\r\ntheir natural consistence, but otherwise not materially altered in\r\nquality; and the mucous coat of the intestines being somewhat congested,\r\nif not inflamed. It is the consequence of over-feeding, or the use of\r\nimproper food. Sometimes it is of very short continuance, and disappears\r\nwithout any bad consequence; the health being unaffected, and the\r\ncharacter of the fæces not otherwise altered than by assuming a fluid\r\ncharacter. It may not be bad practice to wait a day, or possibly two, as\r\nit is desirable for the action of the intestines to be restored without\r\nthe aid of art. I should by no means give a physic-ball, or a grain of\r\ncalomel, in simple diarrhoea. I should fear the establishment of that\r\nspecies of purging which is next to be described. The castor-oil mixture\r\nusually affords the best hope of success.\r\n\r\nHabitual diarrhoea is not an unfrequent disease in petted dogs: in some\r\nit is constitutional, in others it is the effect of neglected\r\nconstipation. A state of chronic inflammation is induced, which has\r\nbecome part of the constitution of the dog; and, if repressed in the\r\nintestines, it will appear under a more dangerous form in some other\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSENTERY\r\n\r\nis a far more serious complaint. In most cases a considerable degree of\r\ninflammation of the mucous coat exists, and the mucus is separated from\r\nthe membrane beneath, and discharged per anum. The mucus thus separated\r\nfrom the intestinal membrane assumes an acrid character. It not only\r\nproduces inflammation of the membrane, dangerous and difficult to treat,\r\nbut it excoriates the anus and neighbouring parts, and produces pain and\r\ntenesmus.\r\n\r\nThis disease has sometimes been fatally misunderstood. A great deal of\r\nirritation exists in the intestinal membrane generally, and in the lower\r\npart of the rectum particularly. The fæces passing over this denuded\r\nsurface cause a considerable degree of pain, and there is much\r\nstraining, and a very small bit or portion of faces is evacuated. This\r\nhas often been seen by the careless observer; and, as he has taken it as\r\nan indication of costiveness, some drastic purgative has been\r\nadministered, and the animal quickly killed.\r\n\r\nNo one that had ascertained the real nature of the disease would\r\nadminister calomel in any form or combination; but the anodyne mixture\r\nas an enema, and also administered by the mouth, is the only medicine\r\nfrom which benefit can be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTIVENESS\r\n\r\nis a disease when it becomes habitual. It is connected with disease of\r\nthe intestinal canal. Many dogs have a dry constipated habit, often\r\ngreatly increased by the bones on which they are too frequently fed.\r\nThis favours the disposition to mange and to many diseases depending on\r\nmorbid secretions. It produces indigestion, encourages worms, blackens\r\nthe teeth, and causes fetid breath. The food often accumulates in the\r\nintestines, and the consequence is inflammation of these organs. A dog\r\nshould never be suffered to remain costive more than a couple of days.\r\nAn aloetic ball or some Epsom salts should then be administered; and\r\nthis failing to produce the desired effect, the castor-oil mixture, with\r\nspirits of buckthorn and white poppies, should be administered, and the\r\nuse of the clyster-pipe resorted to. It may be necessary to introduce\r\nthe finger or the handle of a spoon when the fæcal matter is more than\r\nusually hard, and it is with difficulty broken down; small doses of\r\ncastor-oil should be afterwards resorted to, and recourse occasionally\r\nbe had to boiled liver, which the dog will rarely refuse. The best\r\nmeans, however, of preventing costiveness in dogs, as well as in men, is\r\nregular exercise. A dog who is kept chained up in a kennel should be\r\ntaken out and have a certain quantity of exercise once in the\r\ntwenty-four hours. When this cannot be done, the food should consist\r\nchiefly of well-boiled farinaceous matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY\r\n\r\nAnother disease, which is not confined to the abdominal cavity, is\r\ndropsy: but, as in the dog it most commonly assumes that form which is\r\ntermed ascites, or dropsy of the abdomen, it may be noticed in this\r\nplace. It is seldom an idiopathic or primary affection, but is\r\ngenerally the consequence of some other disease, most commonly of an\r\ninflammatory kind.\r\n\r\nDropsy is a collection of fluid in some part of the frame, either from\r\nincreased exhalation, or from diminished absorption, the consequence\r\nof inflammation. The divisions of dropsy are into active and passive, or\r\nacute and chronic. The causes are also very properly arranged as\r\npredisposing and exciting. The diseases on which dropsy most frequently\r\nsupervenes are fevers and visceral inflammations and obstructions. The\r\ndog is peculiarly subject to 'ascites' or 'dropsy of the belly', and the\r\nquantity of fluid contained in the abdomen is sometimes almost\r\nincredible. It is usually accompanied or characterised by a weak,\r\nunequal, small, and frequent pulse--paleness of the lips, tongue, and\r\ngums--flaccidity of the muscles, hurried breathing on the least\r\nexertion, feebleness of the joints, swellings of the lower limbs,\r\neffusion of fluid into the integuments or among the muscles, before\r\nthere is any considerable effusion into the thorax or the abdomen, and\r\nan unhealthy appearance of the cutaneous surface. The urine seldom\r\ncoagulates. This form of dropsy is usually seated in the abdomen or\r\ncellular tissue.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of ascites is seldom perfectly successful. The great\r\nextent of the peritoneum, the number and importance of the viscera with\r\nwhich it is connected, and of the absorbent glands which it encloses,\r\nthe number and weakness of the veins which transmit their blood to the\r\nportal vessels, and the absence of valves, in some measure account for\r\nthe frequent accumulation of fluid in this cavity. It appears in both\r\nsexes from the usual causes of inflammatory disease. Unwholesome diet,\r\nthe drastic operation of purgatives, external injuries, the suppression\r\nof accustomed secretions and discharges, all are exciting causes of\r\ndropsy.\r\n\r\nThe animal has suffered materially from mange, which has been apparently\r\ncured: the itchiness and eruption altogether disappear, but many weeks\r\ndo not elapse ere ascites begins to be seen, and the abdomen is\r\ngradually distended with fluid. When this appears in young and healthy\r\nanimals, it may be conquered; but when there has been previous disease\r\nof almost any kind, comparatively few patients permanently recover.\r\nIrritability of the stomach, and a small and accelerated pulse, are\r\nunfavourable. If the operation of tapping has taken place, at all times\r\nthere is danger; but, if there is a thick, brown, albuminous or fetid\r\ndischarge, it is very unlikely that any permanent advantage will result\r\nfrom the operation.\r\n\r\nWe will introduce a few cases as they occur in our clinical records.\r\n\r\n'November 7th, 1821'.--A spaniel, nine years old, had been, during four\r\nmonths, alternately asthmatic or mangy, or both. Within the last few\r\ndays she had apparently increased in size. I was sent for. The first\r\ntouch of the abdomen betrayed considerable fluctuation. She likewise had\r\npiles, sore and swelled. I ordered an alterative ball to be given\r\nmorning and night.\r\n\r\n'8th'. One of the balls has been given, and two doses of castor oil; but\r\nno effect has been produced. An injection was administered.\r\n\r\n'9th'. A small evacuation of water has been produced, and the bowels\r\nhave been slightly opened. Give a dose of the castor-oil mixture.\r\n\r\n'10th'. The obstruction has been removed; the enlargement is somewhat\r\ndiminished; much water has passed. Give an alterative ball every\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n'14th'. The alteratives have been continued, and there is a slow but\r\nevident decrease of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n'18th'. I cannot detect any effusion in the abdomen. Give a pill every\r\nalternate day for a fortnight. At the expiration of this period the dog\r\nwas apparently well.\r\n\r\n'April 23d', 1822.--A terrier, ten years old, had cough and mange, which\r\nceased. The belly for the first time began to enlarge, and on feeling\r\nthe dog considerable fluctuation was evident. He would not eat, but he\r\ndrank immoderately. Give daily a ball consisting of tonic and physic\r\nmist., with powdered digitalis and tartrate of iron.\r\n\r\n'May 6th'.--He is in better spirits, feeds tolerably well, but is rather\r\nincreased in size. Give daily a ball of tartrate of iron, digitalis,\r\nginger, and a grain of calomel.\r\n\r\n22'd'. Much thinner, the belly very considerably diminished: a slight\r\nfluctuation is still to be perceived. Continue medicine, with a\r\nhalf-grain only of calomel.\r\n\r\n'July 17th'.--The medicine has been regularly given, and the water of\r\nthe abdomen has rapidly disappeared, until a fortnight ago: since that\r\ntime it has been once more filling. The medicine was ordered to be\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n'August 6th'.--The medicine has once more produced its proper effect,\r\nand the fluid has disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn the '16th', however, the fluctuation was again too plainly felt, and\r\nthe owner determined to have nothing more to do with the case. The\r\nanimal was never brought again, nor could I trace it. The dog might have\r\nbeen saved if the owner had done it justice.\r\n\r\nAs soon as dropsy appears to be established, proper medicines must be\r\nresorted to. Foxglove, nitre, and ginger should be first tried in the\r\nproportional doses of one, ten, and eight grains, given morning and\r\nnight. If this does not succeed, iodine from half-a-grain to a grain may\r\nbe given morning and night, and a weak solution of iodine rubbed on the\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\nThis being ineffectual, recourse may be had to tapping, taking care that\r\nthe trocar is not plunged sufficiently deep to wound the intestines. The\r\nplace for the operation is directly on the 'linea alba', or middle line\r\nof the belly, and about midway between the pubis and the navel. The\r\nwhole of the intestinal fluid may be suffered to escape. A bandage\r\nshould then be applied round the belly, and retained there a week or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine very properly states, that the difference between fatness and\r\ndropsy is, that the belly hangs pendulous in dropsy, while the back bone\r\nstands up, and the hips are protruded through the skin; while the hair\r\nis rough, and the feeling of the coat is peculiarly harsh. It may be\r\ndistinguished from pregnancy by the teats enlarging, in the latter case,\r\nas gestation advances, and the young ones may occasionally be felt to\r\nmove. In addition to this it may be stated, that the presence of water\r\nis readily and unerringly detected. If the right hand is laid on one\r\nside of the belly, and the other side is gently struck with the left\r\nhand, an undulating motion will be readily perceived.\r\n\r\nIn old dogs, dropsy, under the title of \"anasarca,\" is an unfrequent but\r\noccasional accompaniment of ascites. If pressure is made on any\r\nparticular parts, they yield and continue depressed for a longer or\r\nshorter period of time, and slowly and by degrees regain their natural\r\nform. The skin is dry and distended, and with no natural action; the\r\ncirculation is languid and small, the muscular powers are diminished,\r\nthe animal is unquiet, the thirst is great, the tongue is pale, the\r\nappetite diminished, and the limbs are swelled. The best mode, of\r\ntreatment is the infliction of some very small punctures in the\r\ndistended skin, and the application of gentle friction. The majority of\r\ncases of this kind are usually fatal, and so is almost every case of\r\nencysted dropsy.\r\n\r\nA dog had cough in February, 1825. Various medicines were administered,\r\nand at length the cough almost suddenly ceased, and evident ascites\r\nappeared. The thirst was insatiable, the dog would not touch food, and\r\nhe was unable to lie down more than two minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nDigitalis, cream of tartar, and hydrarg. submur. were given on the 9th\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th he was much worse, and apparently dying. He had been unable\r\nto rise for the last twelve hours, and lay panting. I punctured the\r\nabdomen, and four quarts of fluid were evacuated.\r\n\r\n'14th'. The panting continues. The dog will not eat, but he can lie down\r\nin any posture.\r\n\r\n'15th'. The panting is diminished, the appetite is returning, and water\r\ncontinues to ooze from the wound,\r\n\r\n'17th'. The wound healed on the night of the 15th, and already the fluid\r\nbegins to collect. The medicine still continued.\r\n\r\n'20th'. The spirits good, and strength improving; but the belly is\r\nevidently filling, and matter is discharged from both the nose and eyes.\r\n\r\n'26th'. The swelling a little diminished, respiration easy, and the dog\r\nwalking comfortably about, and feeding well.\r\n\r\n'May 13th'.--The swelling, which for some days past diminished, is now\r\nagain increasing; but the dog is strong and breathes easily. Medicine as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n'24th.'. The dog is thinner, weaker, filling fast, and the thirst\r\nexcessive. [Symbol: Rx]: Crem. tart., ferri tart. [Symbol: ounce] ij.,\r\npulv. flor. anthemid. [Symbol: ounce] iiij., conser. ros. q. s.: divide\r\nin bol. xii.: cap. in dies.\r\n\r\n'27th'. During two days he has been unable to lie down more than a\r\nminute at a time. Again tapped: fully as much fluid was evacuated as\r\nbefore; but there is now blood mingling with it.\r\n\r\n30th. Much relieved by the tapping, and breathes with perfect ease;\r\nbut, now that the enormous belly is reduced, the dog is very thin. Bol.\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nJune 8th. Within the last three days the animal has filled again with\r\nextraordinary rapidity. [Symbol: Rx;]: Ferr. tart. [Symbol: scruple] j.,\r\nopii. gr. 1/4, pulv. gentianæ [Symbol: scruple] j., cons. ros. q. s.: f.\r\nbol. capiend. in dies.\r\n\r\n13th. Is again strangely distended; I advised, or rather solicited,\r\nthat it might be destroyed; but this not being granted, I once more\r\ntapped him. At least a gallon of dark-coloured fluid was evacuated.\r\n\r\n22d. Again rapidly filling, but not losing either flesh or strength.\r\n\r\nJuly 4th.--Once more punctured, and a gallon of dark-coloured fluid\r\nevacuated.\r\n\r\n12th. Again filling and rapidly losing flesh and strength.\r\n\r\n26th. Once more tapped: immediately after which he appeared to be\r\nrevived, but almost immediately began again to fill.\r\n\r\nAug. 2d.--He had eaten tolerably; appeared to have nothing more than\r\nusual the matter with him, when, being missed for an hour, he was found\r\ndead. No examination was permitted.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 a spaniel, six years old, was brought to the infirmary. It had\r\nhad an asthmatic cough, which had left it. It was now hollow in the\r\nflanks, the belly pendulous, and an evident fluctuation of water. The\r\nowner would not consent to any operation. An aloetic physic-ball,\r\nhowever, was given every fifth day, and a ball, composed of tartrate of\r\niron, digitalis, nitre, and antimonial powder, on every intermediate\r\nmorning and night. The water evidently accumulated; the dog was sent\r\nfor, and died in the course of a week.\r\n\r\nThere are a few medicines that may be useful in arresting the effusion\r\nof the fluid; but they too often fail in producing any considerable\r\nbenefit. The fox-glove is, perhaps, possessed of the greatest power,\r\ncombined with nitre, squills, and bitartrate of potash. At other times\r\nchamomile, squills, and spirit of nitrous ether, may be tried.\r\n\r\nThe following case, treated by the administration of iodine, by\r\nProfessor Dick, is important:--\r\n\r\nA black and tan coloured retriever was sent to me labouring under\r\nascites. He was tapped, and two quarts of fluid abstracted. Tonics,\r\ncombined with diuretics were given, but the fluid continued to\r\naccumulate, and in three weeks he was again tapped, and another two\r\nquarts drawn away. The disease still went on, and a fortnight afterwards\r\na similar quantity was withdrawn. Various remedies were tried in order\r\nto check the power of the disease, but without effect, and the abdomen\r\nagain became as much distended with the effused serum as before.\r\n\r\nHe was then put under a course of iodine, which soon began to show its\r\nbeneficial influence by speedily allaying his excessive thirst; and in\r\nabout a month the whole of the effused fluid was absorbed, although from\r\nthe size of the abdomen it must have amounted to a similar quantity to\r\nthat drawn off on the previous occasions. The dog's appetite soon\r\nreturned; he gained flesh rapidly, and has continued quite well, and,\r\nfrom being a perfect skeleton, soon became overloaded with fat.\r\n\r\nInduced by the great benefit derived in this case from the iodine, I\r\ntook the opportunity of trying it on a Newfoundland dog similarly\r\naffected. He was put on a course of iodine, and the quantity of the drug\r\nwas gradually increased. As absorption rapidly commenced, the fluid was\r\ncompletely taken up; but, partly in consequence of pushing the medicine\r\ntoo far, and partly from extensive disease in the liver, unfavourable\r\nsymptoms took place, and he sunk rather unexpectedly. Still, however,\r\nfrom the obvious and decided advantage derived from the medicine, I have\r\nno doubt that iodine will be found one of the most efficient remedies in\r\ndropsy in dogs.\r\n\r\nIodine is a truly valuable drug. When first introduced into veterinary\r\npractice it was observed that it readily accomplished the reduction of\r\nthe enlarged glands that frequently remain after catarrh; but it was\r\npresently evident that it reduced almost every kind of tumour, even the\r\ngrowth of tubercles in the lungs. Professor Morton, in his Manual of\r\nPharmacy, has admirably described the different combinations of iodine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIVER\r\n\r\nof the dog seems to follow a law of comparative anatomy, that its bulk\r\nshall be in an inverse proportion of that of the lungs. The latter are\r\nnecessarily capacious; for they need a large supply of arterial blood,\r\nin order to answer to their rapid expenditure when the utmost exertion\r\nof strength and speed is required. The liver is, therefore, restricted\r\nin its size and growth. Nevertheless, it has an important duty to\r\nfulfil, namely, to receive the blood that is returned from the\r\nintestines, to separate from the blood, or to secrete, by means of it,\r\nthe bile; and then to transmit the remaining portion of it to the lungs,\r\nwhere it undergoes the usual process of purification, and is changed to\r\narterial blood. In the performance of this office, the liver often\r\nundergoes a state of inflammation, and disease ensues, inveterate, and\r\nsetting at defiance every means of cure. Both the skin and the urine\r\nbecome tinged with a yellow effusion. The animal is dull, and gradually\r\nwastes away.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the yellow hue becomes more intense, and particularly on\r\nthe cuticle, the conjunctiva, the iris, the gums, and the lips. A state\r\nof fever becomes more and more perceptible, and there are alternations\r\nof cold and heat. The pulse varies from 80 to 120; the dry tongue hangs\r\nfrom the mouth; the appetite ceases, but the animal is peculiarly\r\ndesirous of cold water. The dog becomes restless; he seeks to hide\r\nhimself; and he groans, if the parts in the neighbourhood of the liver\r\nare pressed upon.\r\n\r\nFrequent vomitings now appear, slimy, and evidently containing gall. The\r\nanimal becomes visibly thinner, obstinately refuses all solid food, and\r\nonly manifests thirst. He begins to stagger as he walks; he withdraws\r\nhimself from observation; he anxiously seeks some dark place where he\r\nmay lay himself with his chest and belly resting on the cold ground, his\r\nfore legs stretched out before him, and his hind legs almost as far\r\nbehind him. The fever increases, the skin becomes of a dark yellow\r\ncolour, the mucous membrane of the mouth and conjunctiva is of a dirty\r\nred, the expired air is evidently hot, the gaze is anxious, the urine is\r\nof a saffron yellow, or even darker: in short, there now appears every\r\nsymptom of inflammation of the liver, with jaundice.\r\n\r\nAs the disease proceeds the animal begins to vomit masses of a yellowish\r\ngreen substance, occasionally mixed with blood. He wastes away to a\r\nskeleton, he totters in his walk, he is half unconscious, the pulse\r\nbecomes weak and interrupted, the temperature sinks, and death ensues.\r\n\r\nThe duration and course of the disease are deceptive. It occasionally\r\nproceeds so insidiously that several days are suffered to pass before\r\nthe owner perceives any marks of disease, or seeks any aid. The duration\r\nof the disease is usually from ten to twelve days. It terminates in\r\ncongestion of blood in the liver, or a gradual restoration to health.\r\nThe latter can only take place in cases where the inflammation has\r\nproceeded very slowly; where the commencement and progress of the\r\ndisease could be discovered by debility and slight yellowness of the\r\nskin, and especially where speedy recourse has been had to medical aid.\r\n\r\nThe predisposing causes of this disease are often difficult to discover.\r\nThe dog, in warm climates, seems to have a natural disposition to it. As\r\nexciting causes, atmospheric influence may be reckoned, sultry days,\r\ncold nights, and damp weather. Other occasional causes may be found in\r\nviolent falls, bruises, and overfeeding. Fat petted dogs that are easily\r\noverheated by exertion are often attacked by this disease. The result of\r\nthe disease depends on its duration, course, and complication. If it is\r\nattended to early, it can generally be cured. If it has existed for\r\nseveral days, and the fever has taken on a typhoid character--if the\r\nyellow hue is perceptible--the appetite failing, and vomiting ensuing,\r\nthe cure is doubtful; and, if inflammation of the stomach has taken\r\nplace, with high fever, vomiting of blood, wasting away, and fits\r\noccurring, there is no chance of cure.\r\n\r\nWhen simple jaundice alone is visible, a moderate laxative of sulphate\r\nof magnesia and tartaric acid, in conjunction with some aromatic and\r\nmucilaginous fluid, or, quite in the beginning of the disease, an\r\nemetic, will be found of considerable service; but, when the yellow\r\ncolour has become more intense, and the animal will no longer eat, and\r\nthe fever and weakness are increased, it is necessary to give calomel,\r\ntartar-emetic, camphor, and opium, in the form of pills, and to rub some\r\nstrong liniment on the region of the liver: the doses of calomel,\r\nhowever, must be very small. If inflammation of the stomach appears,\r\nmucilaginous fluids only must be given. Bleeding may be of service in\r\nthe commencement of the disease, but afterward it is hurtful.\r\n\r\nThis is an account of hepatitis as it occasionally appears, and\r\nparticularly on the Continent; but it does not often assume so virulent\r\na character in our country. There is often restlessness, thirst, and\r\nsickness, accompanied by much prostration of strength; or general heat\r\nand tenderness. Occasionally there is purging; but much oftener\r\nconstipation, that bids defiance to almost every medicine. The principal\r\nor almost only hope of cure consists in bleeding, physicking, and\r\nblistering on the right side.\r\n\r\nOf bilious disease, assuming the character of inflammation, we have too\r\nmany cases. It may be spontaneous or brought on by the agency of other\r\naffections. Long-continued and inveterate mange will produce it. It is\r\noften connected with, or produced by, distemper, or a dull inflammatory\r\ndisease of the liver, and it is generally accompanied by pustular\r\neruption on the belly. The skin is usually tinged of a yellow hue, and\r\nthe urine is almost invariably impregnated with bile. The suffusion\r\nwhich takes place is recognised among sportsmen by the term \"yellows.\"\r\nThe remedy should be some mercurial, with gentian and aloes given twice\r\nin the day, and mercurial ointment well rubbed in once in the day. If\r\nthis treatment is steadily pursued, and a slight soreness induced in the\r\nmouth, the treatment will usually be successful. Mr. Blaine observes,\r\n\r\n  \"A moderate soreness of the mouth is to be encouraged and kept up. I\r\n  have never succeeded in removing the complaint without it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE.\r\n\r\nM. W. Leblanc, of Paris, has given an interesting account of the causes\r\nand treatment of 'jaundice' in the dog.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing symptom of this disease in the dog is a yellow\r\ndiscoloration of the skin and the mucous membranes of greater or less\r\nintensity. It generally announces the existence of very serious disease,\r\nas inflammation of the liver and its excretory ducts, or of the\r\ngall-bladder, or the stomach, or small intestines, or contraction or\r\n'obliteration' of the excretory ducts of the liver, in consequence of\r\ninflammation of these vessels, or the presence of concrete substances\r\nformed from the bile. The dogs in which he found the most decided traces\r\nof this disease laboured under diarrhea, with stools of a reddish brown\r\nor black colour for one, two or three days.\r\n\r\nThe causes of jaundice are chiefly over-fatigue (thus, greyhounds are\r\nmore subject to it than pointers), immersions in water, fighting,\r\nemetics or purgatives administered in over-doses, the repeated use of\r\npoisonous substances not sufficiently strong at once to destroy the\r\nanimal, the swallowing of great quantities of indigestible food, and\r\ncontusions of the abdominal viscera, especially about the region of the\r\nliver. The most serious, if not the most common cause, is cold after\r\nviolent and long-continued exercise; and especially when the owners of\r\ndogs, seeing them refuse their food after a long chase, give them\r\npowerful purgatives or emetics.\r\n\r\nThe treatment should have strict relation to the real or supposed cause\r\nof jaundice, and its most evident concomitant circumstances. Some of\r\nthese symptoms are constant and others variable. Among the first,\r\nwhatever be the cause of the disease, we reckon acceleration of the\r\npulse; fever, with paroxysms of occasional intensity; and a yellow or\r\nreddish-yellow discoloration of the urine. Among the second are\r\nconstipation, diarrhoea, the absence or increase of colour in the faecal\r\nmatter, whether solid or fluid. When they are solid, they are usually\r\nvoid of much colour; when, on the contrary, there is diarrhea, the fæces\r\nare generally mingled with blood more or less changed. Sometimes the\r\ndejections are nearly black, mixed with mucus. It is not unusual for a\r\nchest affection to be complicated with the lesions of the digestive\r\norgans, which are the cause of jaundice.\r\n\r\nWith these leading symptoms there are often others connected that are\r\ncommon to many diseases; such as dryness and heat of the mouth, a fetid\r\nsmell, a staggering gait, roughness of the hair, and particularly of\r\nthat of the back; an insatiable thirst, accompanied by the refusal of\r\nall food; loss of flesh, which occasionally proceeds with astonishing\r\nrapidity; a tucked-up flank, with hardness and tenderness of the\r\nanterior part of the belly.\r\n\r\nThe jaundice which is not accompanied with fever, nor indeed with any\r\nmorbid change but the colour of the skin, will require very little\r\ntreatment. It will usually disappear in a reasonable time, and M.\r\nLeblanc has not found that any kind of treatment would hasten that\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\nWhen any new symptom becomes superadded to jaundice, it must be\r\nimmediately combated. Fever, injection of the vessels of the\r\nconjunctiva, constipation, diarrhoea, or the discoloration of the urine,\r\nrequire one bleeding at least, with some mucilaginous drinks. Purgatives\r\nare always injurious at the commencement of the disease.\r\n\r\n  \"I consider,\" says M. Leblanc, \"this fact to be of the utmost\r\n  importance. Almost the whole of the dogs that have been brought to me\r\n  seriously ill with jaundice, have been purged once or more; and either\r\n  kitchen salt, or tobacco, or jalap, or syrup of buckthorn, or emetic\r\n  tartar, or some unknown purgative powders, have been administered.\r\n\r\n  \"Bleeding should be resorted to, and repeated if the fever continues,\r\n  or the animal coughs, or the respiration be accelerated. When the\r\n  pulse is subdued, and the number of pulsations are below the natural\r\n  standard--if the excrements are still void of their natural colour--if\r\n  the constipation continues, or the animal refuses to feed--an ounce of\r\n  manna dissolved in warm water should be given, and the dog often\r\n  drenched with linseed tea. If watery diarrhoea should supervene, and\r\n  the belly is not hot nor tender, a drachm or more, according to the\r\n  size of the dog, of the sulphate of magnesia or soda should be\r\n  administered, and this medicine should be repeated if the purging\r\n  continues; more especially should this aperient be had recourse to\r\n  when the fæces are more or less bloody, there being no fever nor\r\n  peculiar tenderness of the belly.\r\n\r\n  \"When the liquid excrement contains much blood, and that blood is of a\r\n  deep colour, all medicines given by the mouth should be suspended, and\r\n  frequent injections should be thrown up, consisting of thin starch,\r\n  with a few drops of laudanum. Too much cold water should not be\r\n  allowed in this stage of the disease. Injections, and drinks composed\r\n  of starch and opium, are the means most likely to succeed in the black\r\n  diarrhoea, which is so frequent and so fatal, and which almost always\r\n  precedes the fatal termination of all the diseases connected with\r\n  jaundice.\r\n\r\n  \"In simple cases of jaundice the neutral salts have seldom produced\r\n  much good effect; but I have obtained considerable success from the\r\n  diascordium, in doses of half a drachm to a drachm.\r\n\r\n  \"Great care should be taken with regard to the diet of the dog that\r\n  has had jaundice, with bloody or black diarrhoea; for the cases of\r\n  relapse are frequent and serious and almost always caused by improper\r\n  or too abundant food. A panada of bread, with a little butter, will\r\n  constitute the best nourishment when the dog begins to recover his\r\n  appetite. From this he may be gradually permitted to return to his\r\n  former food. Most especially should the animal not be suffered to take\r\n  cold, or to be left in a low or damp situation. This attention to the\r\n  food of the convalescent dog may be thought to be pushed a little too\r\n  far; but experience has taught me to consider it of the utmost\r\n  importance, and it is neither expensive nor troublesome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPLEEN AND PANCREAS.\r\n\r\nThe spleen is generally regarded as an appendage to the absorbent\r\nsystem. Tiedemann and Gmelin consider that its specific function is to\r\nsecrete from the blood a fluid which possesses the property of\r\ncoagulation, and which is carried to the thoracic duct, and then, being\r\nunited with the chyle, converts it into blood, and causes an actual\r\ncommunication between the arterial and absorbent systems. According,\r\nhowever, to Dr. Bostock, there is a fatal objection to this, namely,\r\nthat animals have been known to live an indefinite length of time after\r\nthe removal of the spleen, without any obvious injury to their\r\nfunctions, which could not have been the case if the spleen had been\r\nessentially necessary for so important a process.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the diseases of the spleen in the dog appears to be less\r\nadvanced than in any other animal. In the cases that I have seen, the\r\nearliest indications were frequent vomiting, and the discharge of a\r\nyellow, frothy mucus. The animal appeared uneasy, shivering, the ears\r\ncold, the eyes unnaturally protuberant, the nostrils dilated, the flanks\r\nagitated, the respiration accelerated, and the mucous membranes pale.\r\nThe best treatment I know is the administration, twice in the day, of a\r\nball composed of a grain of calomel and the same quantity of aloes, and\r\nfive grains of ginger. The dog frequently cries out, both when he is\r\nmoved and when he lies on his bed. In the course of three days the\r\nyellow mucus is generally disappearing, and the expression of pain is\r\nmaterially diminished.\r\n\r\nIf the bowels are much constipated after two days have passed, two\r\nscruples of aloes may be given, and a grain of calomel; frequent\r\ninjections may also be administered.\r\n\r\nWe are almost totally ignorant of the functions of the 'pancreas'. It\r\nprobably is concerned in assimilating the food, and converting the chyme\r\nof the stomach into chyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEY\r\n\r\nis a serious and dangerous malady. This organ is essentially vascular in\r\nits texture; and although it is small in volume, yet, on account of the\r\nquantity of blood which it contains, and the rapidity with which its\r\nsecretions are performed, it is disposed to frequent and dangerous\r\ninflammation. The immediate causes of inflammatory action in this viscus\r\nare blows and contusions in the lumbar region; hard work long continued,\r\nand the imprudent use of stimulating substances employed as\r\naphrodisiacs; the presence of calculi in the kidney, and the arrest of\r\nthe urine in the bladder. The whole of the kidney may be affected with\r\nanæmia or defect of blood, or this may be confined to the cortical\r\nsubstance, or even to the tubular. The kidneys are occasionally much\r\nlarger than usual, without any other change of structure; or simple\r\nhypertrophy may affect but one of them. They are subject to atrophy,\r\nwhich may be either general or partial; or one of the kidneys may be\r\ncompletely wanting, and this evidently the consequence of violence or\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nHydatids, though seldom met with in the human kidney, are not\r\nunfrequently found in that of the dog. All these are circumstances that\r\nhave not received sufficient attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCULOUS CONCRETIONS\r\n\r\nare of more frequent occurrence than is generally imagined, but they are\r\nnot confined to the kidneys; there is scarcely a portion of the frame in\r\nwhich they have not been found, particularly in the brain, the glandular\r\nsubstance, and the coats of the intestines.\r\n\r\nI cannot say with Mr. Blaine that I have seen not less than 40 or 50\r\ncalculi in my museum; but I have seen too many fearful examples of the\r\ncomplaint. There has been usually great difficulty in the urinary\r\nevacuation; and at length one of the calculi enters the urethra, and so\r\nblocks up the flow of the urine that mortification ensues.\r\n\r\nM. Lautour relates a case of renal calculus in a dog. He had\r\noccasionally voided his urine with some difficulty, and had walked\r\nslowly and with evident pain. August 30, 1827, a sudden exacerbation\r\ncame on, and the dog was dreadfully agitated. He barked and rolled\r\nhimself on the ground almost every minute; be made frequent attempts to\r\nvoid his urine, which came from him drop by drop. When compelled to\r\nwalk, his hind and fore legs seemed to mingle together, and his loins\r\nwere bent into a perfect curve; his flanks were drawn in; he could\r\nscarcely be induced to eat; and he evidently suffered much in voiding\r\nhis fæces. Mild and demulcent liquids were his only food. Warm baths and\r\ninjections were applied almost unceasingly, and in eight days he seemed\r\nto have perfectly gained his health.\r\n\r\nIn March, in the following year, the symptoms returned with greater\r\nintensity. His hind limbs were dragged after him; he rapidly lost flesh,\r\nand his howlings were fearful and continuous. The same mode of treatment\r\nwas adopted without any good effect, and, his cries continuing, he was\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe stomach and intestines were healthy. The bladder was enlarged from\r\nthe thickness and induration of its parietes; the mucous membrane of it\r\nwas covered with ecchymoses; the kidneys were three or four times their\r\nnatural size; and the pelvis contained a calculus weighing 126 grains,\r\ncomposed of 58 grains of uric acid and 58 of ammonia, with 10 grains of\r\nphosphate of lime.\r\n\r\nOf the nature and causes of urinary calculi in the bladder we know very\r\nlittle. We only know that some solid body finds its way or is formed\r\nthere, gradually increases in size, and at length partially or entirely\r\noccupies the bladder. Boerhaave has given a singular and undeniable\r\nproof of this. He introduced a small round pebble into the bladder of a\r\ndog. The wound perfectly healed. A few months afterwards the animal was\r\nkilled, and there was found a calculus of considerable size, of which\r\nthe pebble was the nucleus.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the pressure of the bladder on the calculus which it\r\ncontains is exceedingly great, so much so, indeed, as to crush the\r\ncalculus. A small calculus may sometimes be forcibly extracted, or cut\r\ndown upon and removed; but when the calculus is large, a catheter or\r\nbougie must be passed up the penis as far as the curve in the urethra,\r\nand then somewhat firmly held with the left hand, and pressing against\r\nthe urethra. A scalpel should be taken, and an incision made into the\r\nurethra. The catheter being now withdrawn, and the finger or a pair of\r\nforceps introduced into the bladder, the calculus may be grasped and\r\nextracted.\r\n\r\nThere are some instances in which as many as 20 or 30 small calculi have\r\nbeen taken from the bladder of a dog. Twice I have seen calculi\r\nabsolutely crushed in the bladder of a dog; and Mr. Blaine says that he\r\nfound no fewer than 40 or 50 in the bladder of a Newfoundland dog. One\r\nof them had passed out into the urethra, and had so blocked up the\r\npassage that the flow of urine was prevented, and the animal died of\r\nmortification.\r\n\r\nWith much pleasure I refer to the details of Mr. Blaine with regard to\r\nthe management of 'vesical calculi'.\r\n\r\n  \"When a small calculus,\" says he, \"obstructs the urethra, and can be\r\n  felt, it may be attempted to be forced forward through the urethra to\r\n  the point of the penis, whence it may be extracted by a pair of\r\n  forceps. If it cannot be so moved, it may be cut down upon and removed\r\n  with safety; but when one or more stones are within the bladder, we\r\n  must attempt lithotomy, after having fully satisfied ourselves of\r\n  their existence there by the introduction of the sound; to do which it\r\n  must be remembered that the urethra of the dog in passing the bladder\r\n  proceeds nearly in a direct line backwards, and then, making an acute\r\n  angle, it passes again forwards to the bladder. It must be therefore\r\n  evident, that when it becomes necessary to introduce a catheter,\r\n  sound, or bougie, it must first be passed up the penis to the\r\n  extremity of this angle; the point of the instrument must then be cut\r\n  down upon, and from this opening the instrument may be readily passed\r\n  forward into the bladder. The examination made, and a stone detected,\r\n  it may, if a very small one, be attempted to be pushed forward by\r\n  means of a finger passed up the anus into the urethra; but, as this\r\n  could be practicable only where the dog happened to be a large one, it\r\n  is most probable that nothing short of the operation of lithotomy\r\n  would succeed. To this end, the sound being introduced, pass a very\r\n  small gorget, or otherwise a bistoury, along its groove into the\r\n  bladder, to effect an opening sufficient to admit of the introduction\r\n  of a fine pair of forceps, by which the stone may be laid up and\r\n  extracted.\"\r\n  'Blaine's Canine Pathology', p. 180.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER\r\n\r\nis of frequent occurrence in the dog; it is also occasionally observed\r\nin the horse and the ox. It sometimes appears as an epizootic. It is\r\ngenerally announced by anxiety, agitation, trembling of the hinder\r\nlimbs, frequent attempts to urine, vain efforts to accomplish it, the\r\nevacuation small in quantity, sometimes clear and aqueous, and at other\r\ntimes mucous, laden with sediment, thick and bloody, escaping by jets,\r\npainfully and with great difficulty, and then suddenly rushing out in\r\ngreat quantity. To this list of symptoms colic may often be added. The\r\nanimal drinks with avidity, but seldom eats much, unless at the\r\ncommencement of the complaint. The skin is hard and dry, he looks at his\r\nflanks, and his back and flanks are tender when pressed upon.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter portion of my connexion with Mr. Blaine, this disease\r\nassumed an epidemic character. There was a great drought through almost\r\nevery part of the country. The disease was characterised by general\r\nuneasiness; continual shifting of the posture; a tucked-up appearance;\r\nan anxious countenance; a quick and noisy pulse; continued panting; the\r\nurine voided in small quantities, sometimes discharged drop by drop, or\r\ncomplete stoppage of it. The belly hot, swelled, and tender to the\r\ntouch; the dog becoming strangely irritable, and ready to bite even his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n'1st May', 1824.--Two dogs had been making ineffectual attempts to void\r\ntheir urine for nearly two days. The first was a terrier, and the other\r\na Newfoundland. The terrier was bled, placed in a warm bath, and an\r\naloetic ball, with calomel, administered. He was bled a second time in\r\nthe evening, and a few drops of water were discharged. On the following\r\nday, the urine slowly passed involuntarily from him; but when he\r\nattempted to void any, his efforts were totally ineffectual. Balls\r\ncomposed of camphor, pulv. uva ursi, tinct. ferri mur., mass purg., and\r\npulv. lini. et gum. arab., were administered morning, noon, and night.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th the urine still passed involuntarily. Cold lotions were\r\nemployed, and tonic and astringent medicines administered, with castor\r\noil. He gradually got well, and no trace of the disease remained until\r\nJune the 6th, when he again became thin and weak, and discharged much\r\nbloody urine, but apparently without pain. The uva ursi, oak bark, and\r\npowdered gum-arabic were employed.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th he had become much better, and so continued until the 1st of\r\nJuly, when he again exhibited the same complaint more violently than\r\nbefore.  He was exceedingly tender on the loins, and screamed when he\r\nwas touched. He was bled, returned to his uva ursi and powdered gum, and\r\nrecovered. I saw him two years afterwards apparently well.\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland dog exhibited a similar complaint, with nearly the same\r\naccompaniments.\r\n\r\n'May' 1.--He was disinclined to move; his belly was hard and hot, and he\r\nwas supposed to be costive. Gave an aloetic ball with iron.\r\n\r\n2d. He has endeavoured, in vain, several times to void his urine. He\r\nwalks stiffly with his back bound. Subtract eight ounces of blood; give\r\nanother physic-ball, and apply cold affusion to the loins.\r\n\r\n3d. He frequently attempts to stale, and passes a little urine at each\r\ntime; he still walks and stands with his back bound. Syr. papav. et\r\nrhamni, with tinct. ferr. mur., a large spoonful being given morning and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n4th. He again tries, ineffectually, to void his urine. Mist. et pulv.\r\n\r\n5th. Unable to void a drop of urine; nose hot; tongue hangs down; pants\r\nconsiderably; will not eat; the countenance has an anxious character.\r\nBleed to twelve ounces; apply cold affusion. Medicine as before, with\r\ncold affusion.\r\n\r\n6th. Appears to be in very great pain; not a drop of water has passed\r\nfrom him. Medicine and other treatment as before. In the evening he lay\r\ndown quietly. On the next morning he was found dead. All the viscera\r\nwere sound except the bladder, which was ruptured; the abdomen contained\r\ntwo quarts of bloody fluid. The mucous membrane of the bladder appeared\r\nto be in the highest state of inflammation. It was almost black with\r\nextravasated blood. On the neck of the bladder was an enlargement of the\r\nsize of a goose's egg, and almost filling the cavity of the pelvis. On\r\ncutting into it, more than two ounces of pus escaped.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 1833, a poodle was brought to me. He had not been observed\r\nto pass any urine for two days. He made frequent attempts to void it,\r\nand cried dreadfully. The bladder could be felt distended in the\r\nabdomen. I put him into a warm bath, and took from him a pound of blood.\r\nHe seemed to be a little relieved. I did not leave him until after\r\nmidnight, but was soon roused by his loud screams, and the dog was also\r\nretching violently. The cries and retching gradually abated, and he\r\ndied. The bladder had burst, and the parietes were in a dreadful state\r\nof inflammation.\r\n\r\nA dog had laboured under incontinence of urine more than two months. The\r\nwater was continually dropping from him. The servant told me that, three\r\nmonths before, he had been shut into a room two days, and, being a\r\ncleanly animal, would not stale until he was liberated. Soon after that\r\nthe incontinence of urine was observed. I gave the usual tonic balls,\r\nwith a small portion of opium, night and morning, and ordered cold water\r\nto be frequently dashed on the perinæum. A month afterwards he was quite\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nComparatively speaking, 'profuse staling' is not a common disease,\r\nexcept when it is the consequence of bad food, or strong diuretics, or\r\nactual inflammation. The cause and the result of the treatment are often\r\nobscure. Bleeding, purging, and counter irritation, would be indicated\r\nto a certain extent, but the lowering system must not be carried too\r\nfar. The medicine would probably be catechu, uva ursi, and opium.\r\n\r\nAt times blood mingles with the urine, with or without coagulation. The\r\ncause and the source of it may or may not be determined. Generally\r\nspeaking it is the result of some strain or blow.\r\n\r\nA terrier bitch, in January, 1820, had incontinence of urine. No\r\nswelling or injury could be detected. I used with her the simple tonic\r\nballs.\r\n\r\n10th January'.--She is now considerably better, and only a few drops\r\nare observed.\r\n\r\n2d February'.--The disease which had seemingly been conquered began\r\nagain to reappear; the medicine had been neglected. Again have recourse\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n4'th March'.--The disease now appears to be quite checked by the cold\r\nlotion and the balls.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CASE OF RUPTURE OF THE BLADDER\r\n\r\nThis is a singular account, and stands almost alone.\r\n\r\nThe patient was a valuable spaniel belonging to that breed known as \"The\r\nDuke of Norfolk's,\" and now possessed in its full perfection by the Earl\r\nof Albemarle. Professor Simonds shall give his own account:\r\n\r\nI was informed that almost from a puppy to the time when he was two\r\nyears old, the dog had always been delicate in his appearance, and was\r\nobserved to void his urine with difficulty; but there were not\r\nsufficient indications of disease for the owner to suppose that medical\r\nattendance was necessary until within a few days of his death, and then,\r\nfinding that the act of staling was effected with increased difficulty,\r\nand accompanied with extreme pain; that the dog refused his food, was\r\nfeverish; that at length there were frequent or ineffective efforts to\r\nexpel the urine, the dog crying out from extremity of pain, and it was\r\nsufficiently evident that great mischief was going on, he was placed\r\nunder my care; and even then he was walked a mile and a half to my\r\ninfirmary.\r\n\r\nMy attention was immediately directed to him; the man who brought him\r\ninforming me that he seemed much easier since he left home. On\r\nexamination, I at once pronounced that he could not recover; in fact,\r\nthat he was rapidly sinking; but, from his then state, I could give no\r\nopinion with regard to the precise nature or extent of his disease. He\r\nwas placed upon a bed in an appropriate apartment, with directions not\r\nto be disturbed, and in a few hours he died.\r\n\r\nThe 'post-mortem' appearances were the abdomen containing from four to\r\nfive pints of fluid, having much the character of, but more bloody than,\r\nthat found in cases of ascites. The peritoneum seemed to be dyed from\r\nits immersion in this fluid, as it showed a general red hue, not\r\napparently deeper in some parts than in others. There was an absence, to\r\na great extent, of that beautiful appearance and well-marked course of\r\nthe minute blood-vessels which accompany many cases of original\r\nperitonitis. Extending the examination, I found the bladder to be\r\nruptured, and that the fluid of which I have spoken was to a large\r\nextent composed of urine, mingled with some other secretion from the\r\nperitoneal investure of the abdomen and its viscera, probably produced\r\nfrom the presence of an irritant, the urine being brought into direct\r\ncontact with the membrane. Farther research showed that this rupture of\r\nthe bladder was caused in the manner which I have stated. The\r\n'post-mortem' examination displayed a chronic enlargement of the\r\nprostate gland of a considerable size, causing by its pressure a\r\nmechanical obstruction to the passage of the urine. Death in this\r\ninstance was not immediately brought about by the abnormal state of the\r\noriginal organ affected; but the prostate gland, having early in the\r\nlife of the animal become diseased, and, being gradually increased in\r\nsize, became a cause of still more serious disease, attacking more\r\nimportant organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS.\r\n\r\nThere are various kinds of worms to which the dog is subject; they have\r\noccasionally been confounded with each other; but they are essentially\r\ndifferent in the situations which they occupy, and the effects which\r\nthey produce.\r\n\r\nThe 'ascarides' are small thread-like worms, generally not more than six\r\nor ten lines in length, of a white colour, the head obtuse, and the tail\r\nterminating in a transparent prolongation. They are principally found in\r\nthe rectum. They seem to possess considerable agility; and the itching\r\nwhich they set up is sometimes absolutely intolerable. To relieve this,\r\nthe dog often drags the fundament along the ground.\r\n\r\nAll the domesticated animals are subject to the annoyance which these\r\nworms occasion. They roll themselves into balls as large as a nut, and\r\nbecome entangled so much with each other that it is difficult to\r\nseparate them. Sometimes they appear in the stomach, and in such large\r\nmasses that it is almost impossible to remove them by the act of\r\nvomiting. It has been said that packets of ascarides have been collected\r\nin the stomach containing more than one hundred worms. These collections\r\nare rarely or never got entirely rid of. Enormous doses of medicine may\r\nbe given, and the worms may not be seen again for several weeks; but, at\r\nlength, they reappear as numerous as ever.\r\n\r\nYoung dogs are exceedingly subject to them, and are with great\r\ndifficulty perfectly freed from their attacks. Another species of worm\r\nis the 'teres'. It would resemble the earth-worm in its appearance, were\r\nit not white instead of a red colour. They are very common among dogs,\r\nespecially young dogs, in whom they are often attended by fits.\r\nOccasionally they crawl into the stomach, and there produce a great deal\r\nof irritation.\r\n\r\nAnother, and the most injurious of the intestinal worms, is the\r\n'taenia', or 'tape-worm'. It is many inches in length, almost flat in\r\nthe greater part of its extent, and its two extremities are nearly or\r\nquite equal. Tape-worms associate in groups like the others, but they\r\nare not so numerous; they chiefly frequent the small intestines. They\r\nare sometimes apt to coil themselves, and form a mechanical obstruction\r\nwhich is fatal to the dog.\r\n\r\nThe presence of all these worms is readily detected. There is generally\r\na dry, short cough, a staring coat, a hot and fetid breath, a voracious\r\nappetite, and a peculiar state of the bowels; alternately constipated to\r\na great degree, or peculiarly loose and griping. In young dogs the\r\nemaciated appearance, stinted growth, fetid breath, and frequent fits,\r\nare indications not to be mistaken.\r\n\r\nAt other times, however, the dog is filled with worms with scarcely any\r\nindication of their presence. Mr. Blaine very properly remarks that it\r\ndocs not follow, because no worms are seen to pass away, that there are\r\nnone: neither when they are not seen does it follow even that none pass;\r\nfor, if they remain long in the intestines after they are dead, they\r\nbecome digested like other animal matter.\r\n\r\nThe means of expelling or destroying worms in the intestines of the dog\r\nare twofold: the first and apparently the most natural mode of\r\nproceeding, is the administration of purgatives, and usually of drastic\r\nones; but there is much danger connected with this; not merely the fæces\r\nwill be expelled, but a greater or less portion of the mucus that lines\r\nthe intestinal canal. The consequence of this will be griping and\r\ninflammation to a very dangerous extent. Frequent doses of Epsom salts\r\nhave been given; but not always with success, and frequently with\r\ngriping. Mercurial medicines have been tried; but they have not always\r\nsucceeded, and have often produced salivation. One method of expelling\r\nthe worm has been adopted which has rarely failed, without the slightest\r\nmischief--the administration of glass finely powdered. Not a particle of\r\nit penetrates through the mucus that lines the bowels, while it destroys\r\nevery intestinal worm. The powdered glass is made into a ball with lard\r\nand ginger.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the symptoms caused by taenia may be\r\ninteresting. A dog used to be cheerful, and particularly fond of his\r\nmaster; but gradually his countenance became haggard, his eyes were red,\r\nhis throat was continually filled with a frothy spume, and he stalked\r\nabout with an expression of constant inquietude and suffering. These\r\ncircumstances naturally excited considerable fear with regard to the\r\nnature of his disease, and he was shut up in a court, with the intention\r\nof his being destroyed. Thus shut up, he furiously threw himself upon\r\nevery surrounding object, and tore them with his teeth whenever he could\r\nseize them. He retired into one of the corners of the court, and there\r\nhe was continually rubbing his nose, as it were to extract some foreign\r\nbody; sometimes he bit and tore up the earth, barking and howling\r\nviolently; his hair stood on end, and his flanks were hollow.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of his disease he continued to recognise his master. He\r\nran to him at the slightest word. He refused nothing to drink; but he\r\nwould not eat. He was killed on account of the fear excited among the\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nThe veterinary surgeon who attended him suspected that there was some\r\naffection of the head, on account of the strange manner in which he had\r\nrubbed and beaten it. The superior part of the nose was opened, and two\r\ntæniæ; lanceolatæ were found: it was plain enough that they were the\r\ncause of all the mischief.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the dog nevertheless believed that it was a case of\r\nrabies; he had the caustic applied to his hands, and could not persuade\r\nhimself that he was safe until he had been at the baths of Bourbonne.\r\n[4]\r\n\r\nThere is a worm inhabiting the stomach of young dogs, the 'Ascaris\r\nMarginata', a frequent source of sickness and occasionally of spasmodic\r\ncolic, by rolling itself into knots. It seems occasionally to take a\r\ndislike to its assigned residence, and wanders into the oesophagus, but\r\nrarely into the larger intestines. A dog had a severe cough, which could\r\nnot be subdued by bleeding or physic, or sedative or opiate medicines.\r\nHe was destroyed, and one of these ascarides was found in the trachea.\r\nOthers find their way into the nasal cavity; and a dreadful source of\r\nirritation they are when they are endeavouring to escape, in order to\r\nundergo one of the changes of form to which they are destined, or when\r\nthey have been forced into the nostril in the act of vomiting.\r\n\r\nI once had a dog as a patient, whose case, I confess, I did not\r\nunderstand. He would sneeze and snort, and rub his head and nose along\r\nthe carpet. I happened to say that the symptoms in some respects\r\nresembled those of rabies, and yet, that I could not satisfy myself that\r\nthe dog was rabid. The mention of rabies was sufficient, and in defiance\r\nof my remonstrances the animal was destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe previous symptoms led me to examine the nasal cavity, and I found\r\ntwo of these ascarides, one concealed in the middle and the other in the\r\nupper meatus, through neither of which could any strong current of air\r\nbe forced, and from which the ascarides could not be dislodged.\r\n\r\nWorms may be the cause of sudden death in a dog. The following case,\r\ncommunicated by Professor Dick, illustrates this fact:\r\n\r\nI lately had the body of a dog sent to me: his owner sent the following\r\nletter by the same conveyance.\r\n\r\n  \"My keeper went out shooting yesterday morning with the dog which I\r\n  now send to you. He was quite lively, and apparently well, during the\r\n  former part of the day; but towards evening he was seized with violent\r\n  vomiting. When he came home he refused to eat, and this morning about\r\n  eight o'clock he died. As I have lost all my best dogs rather\r\n  suddenly, I will thank you to have him examined, and the contents of\r\n  his stomach analyzed; and have the kindness to inform me whether he\r\n  has been poisoned, or what was the cause of his death.\"\r\n\r\nOn opening the abdomen, the viscera appeared quite healthy: the stomach\r\nwas removed, and the contents were found to be more decidedly acid than\r\nusual. The acids were the muriatic and acetic: the finding of an\r\nincreased quantity of these is far from being unusual. There was not a\r\ntrace of arsenical, mercurial, nor any other metallic poison present. Of\r\nthe vegetable poisons, I can only say there was not the slightest trace\r\nof the morbid effects of any of them. The pericardium and the left side\r\nof the thorax contained a small quantity of bloody serous fluid, and the\r\nheart was full of black blood. The left lung was a little inflamed. The\r\ntrachea contained some frothy yellow mucous matter, similar to the\r\ncontents of the stomach. In the larynx was found one of those worms\r\noccasionally inhabiting the cavities of the nose, and which had probably\r\nescaped from the nose while the dog had been hunting; and, lodging in\r\nthe larynx, had destroyed the animal by producing spasms of the larynx.\r\nThe worm was about one inch and a half in length, and had partly\r\npenetrated through the rima glottidis. Another worm about the same size\r\nwas found in the left bronchia, and a still smaller one among the mucus\r\nof the trachea: there were also four others in the nose.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I found some worms of the filacia species in the right\r\nventricle of the heart of a dog, which had produced sudden death by\r\ninterrupting the action of the valves.\r\n\r\nThe following is a curious case of tape-worm, by Mr. Reynold:\r\n\r\nOn an estate where a great quantity of rabbits are annually destroyed in\r\nthe month of November, we have observed that several dogs that were\r\npreviously in good health and condition soon became weak, listless, and\r\nexcessively emaciated, frequently passing large portions of the\r\ntape-worm. This induced us to examine the intestines of several hares\r\nand rabbits; and, with, very few exceptions, we found each to contain a\r\nperfect tape-worm three to four feet in length. We then caused two of\r\nthe dogs whose cases appeared the worst to be separated from the others,\r\nfeeding them on potatoes, &c.; and, in eight or ten days, after voiding\r\nseveral feet of the worms, they were perfectly restored to their former\r\nstrength and appearance. The worm disease, hitherto so formidable to the\r\nspaniel and pointer, may in a great measure be fairly attributed to the\r\ncustom of giving them the intestines of their game, under the technical\r\nappellation of \"the paunch.\" The facts above stated, in explaining the\r\ncause of the disease, at the same time suggest the remedy.\r\n\r\n'A worm in the urethra of a dog'.\r\nM. Séon, veterinary surgeon of the Lancers of the Body Guard, was\r\nrequested to examine a dog who strained in vain to void his urine, often\r\nuttering dreadful cries, and then eagerly licking his penis. M. Séon,\r\nafter having tried in vain to abate the irritation, endeavoured to pass\r\nan elastic bougie. He perceived a conical body half an inch long\r\nprotruding from the urethra with each effort of the dog to void his\r\nurine, and immediately afterwards returning into the urethra. He crushed\r\nit with a pair of forceps, and drew it out. It proved to be a worm\r\nresembling a strongylus, four and a half inches long. It was living, and\r\nmoving about. M. Séon could not ascertain its species. The worm being\r\nextracted, the urine flowed, and the dog soon recovered. [5]\r\n\r\n\r\nFISTULA IN THE ANUS.\r\n\r\nThis is a too frequent consequence of piles. It is often the result of\r\nthe stagnation of hardened fæces in the rectum, which produces\r\ninflammation and ulceration, and frequently leaves a fistulous opening.\r\nIf we may judge what the quadruped suffers by the sufferings of human\r\nbeings, it is a sadly painful affair, whether the fistula is external or\r\ninternal. Whether it may be cured by a mild stimulant daily inserted to\r\nthe bottom of the abscess, or whether there is a communication with the\r\nopening of the rectum which buries itself in the cellular tissues around\r\nit, and requires an operation for its cure, it will require the\r\nassistance of a skilful surgeon to effect a cure in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Tetanus observed on a Dog, by M.

It\r\nis, in fact, as in the horse, the sheet-anchor of the practitioner in\r\nthe majority of cases of an inflammatory character. There is some\r\ndifference, however, in the instrument to be used. The lancet is the\r\npreferable instrument in the performance of this operation. The fleam\r\nshould be banished from among the instruments of the veterinary surgeon.\r\n\r\nA ligature being passed round the lower part of the neck, and the head\r\nbeing held up a little on one side, the vein will protrude on either\r\nside of the windpipe. It will usually be advisable to cut away a little\r\nof the hair over the spot designed to be punctured. When a sufficient\r\nquantity of blood is abstracted, it will generally be necessary, and\r\nespecially if the dog is large, to pass a pin through both edges of the\r\norifice, and secure it with a little tow.\r\n\r\nWhen no lancet is at hand, the inside of the flap of the ear may be\r\npunctured with a pen-knife, the course of a vein being selected for this\r\npurpose. In somewhat desperate cases a small portion of the tail may be\r\namputated.\r\n\r\nThe 'superficial brachial vein', the 'cephalic' vein of the human\r\nsubject, and the 'plat' vein of the farrier, may be resorted to in all\r\nlamenesses of the fore limb, and especially in all shoulder-wrenches,\r\nstrains of the loins, and of the thigh and the leg, and muscular and\r\nligamentous extensions of any part of the hind limbs; the 'vena saphena\r\nmajor', and the 'anterior tibial' vein may be punctured in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of blood to be abstracted must be regulated according to\r\nthe size and strength of the dog and the degree of inflammation.\r\n\r\nOne or two ounces may be sufficient for a very small dog, and seven or\r\neight for a large one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORSION\r\n\r\nTo M. Amusat, of Paris, we are indebted for the introduction of the\r\nartery-forceps for the arresting of hemorrhage. I shall do but justice\r\nto him by describing his mode of proceeding. He seizes the divided\r\nvessel with a pair of torsion-forceps in such a manner as to hold and\r\nclose the mouth of the vessel in its teeth. The slide of the forceps\r\nthen shuts its blade, and the artery is held fast. The artery is then\r\ndrawn from out of the tissues surrounding it, to the extent of a few\r\nlines, and freed, with another forceps, from its cellular envelope, so\r\nas to lay bare its external coat. The index and thumb of the left hand\r\nare then applied above the forceps, in order to press back the blood in\r\nthe vessel. He then begins to twist the artery. One of the methods\r\nconsists in continuing the torsion until the part held in the forceps is\r\ndetached. When, however, the operator does not intend to produce that\r\neffect, he ceases, after from four to six revolutions of the vessel on\r\nits axis for the small arteries, and from eight to twelve for the large\r\nones. The hemorrhage instantly stops. The vessel which had been drawn\r\nout is then replaced, as the surrounding parts give support to the knot\r\nwhich has been formed at its extremities. The knot becomes further\r\nconcealed by the retraction of the artery, and this retraction will be\r\nproportionate to the shortening which takes place by the effect of the\r\ntwisting, so that it will be scarcely visible on the surface of the\r\nstump. It is of the utmost importance to seize the artery perfectly, and\r\nto make the stated number of twists, as otherwise the security against\r\nthe danger of consecutive hemorrhage will not be perfect.\r\n\r\nMr. W. B. Costello, of London, was present when the operation was\r\nperformed at Paris. He brought back a full account of it as performed\r\nthere, and availed himself of an early opportunity of putting it to the\r\ntest before some of our metropolitan surgeons. A dog was placed on the\r\ntable, the forceps were applied, and the operation perfectly succeeded.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards a pointer bitch was brought to my infirmary, with\r\na large scirrhous tumour near the anterior teat on the left side. It had\r\nbeen gradually increasing during the last five months. It was becoming\r\nmore irregular in its form, and on one of its tuberculous prominences\r\nwas a reddish spot, soft and somewhat tender, indicating that the\r\nprocess of suppuration was about to commence.\r\n\r\nI had often, or almost uniformly, experienced the power of iodine in\r\ndispersing glandular enlargements in the neck of the dog, and also those\r\nindurated tumours of various kinds which form about the joints of some\r\ndomesticated animals, particularly of cattle; but frequent\r\ndisappointment had convinced me that it was, if not inert, yet very\r\nuncertain in its effect in causing absorption of tumours about the mammæ\r\nof the bitch. Having also been taught that the ultimate success of the\r\nexcision of these enlargements depended on their removal before\r\nsuppuration had taken place, and the neighbouring parts had been\r\ninoculated by the virus which so plentifully flowed from the ulcer, I\r\ndetermined on an immediate operation; and, as the tumour was large, and\r\nshe was in high condition, I thought it a good case for 'the first trial\r\nof torsion'. She was well physicked, and on the third day was produced\r\nbefore my class and properly secured. I had not provided myself with the\r\n'torsion forceps', but relied on the hold I should have on the vessel by\r\nmeans of a pair of common artery forceps; and the effect of imperfect\r\ninstruments beautifully established the power of torsion in arresting\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nTwo elliptical incisions were made on the face of the tumour, and\r\nprolonged anteriorly and posteriorly about an inch from it. The portion\r\nof integument that could be spared was thus enclosed, while the opposed\r\nedges of the wound could be neatly and effectually brought together\r\nafter the operation. The dissection of the integument from the remaining\r\npart of the face of the tumour was somewhat slow and difficult, for it\r\nwas in a manner identified with the hardened mass beneath; but the\r\noperation soon proceeded more quickly, and we very soon had the scirrhus\r\nexposed, and adhering to the thorax by its base. About two ounces of\r\nvenous blood had now been lost.\r\n\r\nI was convinced that I should find the principal artery, by which the\r\nexcrescence was fed, at its anterior extremity, and not far from the\r\nspot where the suppuration seemed to be preparing: therefore, beginning\r\nposteriorly, I very rapidly cut through the cellular texture, elevating\r\nthe tumour and turning it back, until I arrived at the inner and\r\nanterior point, and there was the only source of supply; the artery was\r\nplainly to be seen. In order to give the experiment a fair chance, I\r\nwould not enclose it in the forceps, but I cut through it. A jet of\r\nblood spirted out. I then seized the vessel as quickly as I could, and\r\nbegan to turn the forceps, but before I could effect more than a turn\r\nand a half I lost my hold on the artery. I was vexed, and paused,\r\nwaiting for the renewed gush of blood that I might seize the vessel\r\nagain; but to my surprise not a drop more blood came from the arterial\r\ntrunk. That turn and a half, considerable pressure having been used, had\r\ncompletely arrested the hemorrhage. I can safely say that not more than\r\nfour drachms of arterial blood were lost.\r\n\r\nThe wound was sponged clean: there remained only a very slight oozing\r\nfrom two or three points; the flaps were brought together, secured by\r\nthe ordinary sutures, and the proper bandages applied. The weight of the\r\ntumour was twenty-two ounces; there was no after-bleeding, no unpleasant\r\noccurrences; but the wound, which had been nearly six inches in length,\r\nwas closed in little more than three weeks.\r\n\r\nHe will essentially promote the cause of science, and the cause of\r\nhumanity, who will avail himself of the opportunity which country\r\npractice affords of putting the effect of torsion to the test: and few\r\nthings will be more gratifying than the consciousness of rescuing our\r\npatients from the unnecessary infliction of torture.\r\n\r\nIn docking, it will be found perfectly practicable: our patients will\r\nescape much torture, and tetanus will often be avoided. The principal\r\ndanger from castration has arisen from the severity with which the iron\r\nhas been employed. The colt, the sheep, and the dog will be fair\r\nsubjects for experiment. The cautery, as it regards the first, and the\r\nbrutal violence too frequently resorted to in operating upon the others,\r\nhave destroyed thousands of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION.\r\n\r\nThis operation is performed on a great portion of our domestic animals.\r\nIt renders them more docile, and gives them a disposition to fatten. It\r\nis followed by fewest serious accidents when it is performed on young\r\nanimals. The autumn or spring should, if possible, be chosen for the\r\noperation, for the temperature of the atmosphere is then generally\r\nuniform and moderate. It should be previously ascertained that the\r\nanimal is in perfect health; and he should be prepared by a mash diet\r\nand bleeding, if he is in a plethoric state, or possessed of\r\nconsiderable determination. If it is a young animal that is to be\r\noperated upon, an incision may be made into the scrotum, the testicle\r\nmay be protruded, and the cord cut without much precaution, for the\r\nblood will soon be stayed; but for older animals it will be advisable to\r\nuse a ligature, applied moderately tightly round the spermatic cord a\r\nlittle more than an inch beyond its insertion into the testicle; the\r\nscalpel is then used, and a separation effected between the ligature and\r\nthe testis. The vas derens needs not to be included; a great deal of\r\npain will then be spared to the animal.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary consequences of castration are pain, inflammation,\r\nengorgement, and suppuration. The pain and suppuration are inevitable,\r\nbut generally yield to emollient applications. The engorgement is often\r\nconsiderable at first, but soon subsides, and the suppuration usually\r\nabates in the course of a few days. It has been said that the castrated\r\ndog is more attached and faithful to his master than he who has not been\r\ndeprived of his genital powers: this, however, is to be much doubted. He\r\nhas, generally speaking, lost a considerable portion of his courage, his\r\nenergy, and his strength. He is apt to become idle, and is disposed to\r\naccumulate fat more rapidly. His power of scent is also very\r\nconsiderably diminished and he is less qualified for the sports of the\r\nfield. Of this there can be no doubt. It has been said that he is more\r\nsubmissive: I very much doubt the accuracy of that opinion. He may not\r\nbe so savage as in his perfect state; he may not be so eager in his\r\nfeeding; but there is not the devotion to his master, and the quickness\r\nof comprehension which belongs to the perfect dog.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the ovaries, or spaying of the female, used to be often\r\npractised, and packs of spayed bitches were, and still are, occasionally\r\nkept. In performing this operation, an opening is made into the flank on\r\none side, and the finger introduced--one of the ovaries is laid hold of\r\nand drawn a little out of the belly; a ligature is then applied round\r\nit, just above the bifurcation of the womb, and it is cut through, the\r\nend of the ligature being left hanging out of the wound. The other ovary\r\nis then felt for and drawn out, and excised and secured by a ligature.\r\nThe wound is then sewed up, and a bandage is placed over the incision.\r\nSome farriers do not apply any ligature, but simply sew up the wound,\r\nand in the majority of cases the edges adhere, and no harm comes of the\r\noperation, except that the general character of the animal is\r\nessentially changed. She accumulates a vast quantity of fat, becomes\r\nlistless and idle, and is almost invariably short-lived.\r\n\r\nThe female dog, therefore, should always be allowed to breed. Breeding\r\nis a necessary process; and the female prevented from it is sure to be\r\naffected with disease sooner or later; enormous collections and\r\nindurations will form, that will inevitably terminate in scirrhus or\r\nulceration.\r\n\r\nA troublesome process often occurs when the female is not permitted to\r\nhave young ones; namely, the accumulation of milk in the teats,\r\nespecially if at any previous time, however distant, she may have had\r\npuppies once. The foundation is laid for many unpleasant and\r\nunmanageable complaints. If she is suffered to bring up one litter after\r\nanother, she will have better health than those that are debarred from\r\nintercourse with the male.\r\n\r\nThe temporary union which takes placed between the male and female at\r\nthe period at which they are brought together is a very singular one.\r\nThe corpora cavernosa of the male and the clitoris of the female being\r\nsuddenly distended with blood, it is impossible to withdraw either of\r\nthem until the turgescence of the parts has entirely ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTURITION\r\n\r\nThe pupping usually takes place from the sixty-second to the\r\nsixty-fourth day; and the process having commenced, from a quarter to\r\nthree quarters of an hour generally takes place between the production\r\nof each puppy.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of bitches are lost every year in the act of parturition:\r\nthere seems to be a propensity in the females to associate with dogs\r\nlarger than themselves, and they pay for it with their lives. The most\r\nneglected circumstance during the period of pregnancy is the little\r\nexercise which the mother is permitted to take, while, in point of fact,\r\nnothing tends more to safe and easy parturition than her being permitted\r\nor compelled to take a fair quantity of exercise.\r\n\r\nWhen the time of parturition has arrived, and there is evident\r\ndifficulty in producing the foetus, recourse should be had to the ergot\r\nof rye, which should be given every hour or half hour, according to\r\ncircumstances. If after a certain time some, although little, progress\r\nhas been made, the ergot must be continued in smaller doses, or perhaps\r\nsuspended for a while; but, if all progress is evidently suspended,\r\nrecourse must be had to the hook or the forceps. By gentle but continued\r\nmanipulation much may be done, especially when the muzzle of the puppy\r\ncan be brought into the passage. As little force as possible must be\r\nused, and especially the foetus little broken. Many a valuable animal is\r\ndestroyed by the undue application of force.\r\n\r\nIf the animal seems to be losing strength, a small quantity of laudanum\r\nand ether may be administered.\r\n\r\n  \"The patience of bitches in labour is extreme,\" says Mr. Blaine; \"and\r\n  their distress, if not removed, is most striking and affecting. Their\r\n  look is at such time particularly expressive and apparently\r\n  imploring.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the pupping is protracted, and the young ones are evidently dead,\r\nthe mother may be saved, if none of the puppies have been broken. In\r\nprocess of time the different puppies may, one after another, be\r\nextracted; but when violence has been used at the commencement, or\r\nalmost at any part of the process, death will assuredly follow.\r\n\r\n'June' 15, 1832.--A spaniel bitch was brought to my infirmary to-day,\r\nwho has been in great and constant pain since yesterday, making repeated\r\nbut fruitless efforts to expel her puppies. She is in a very plethoric\r\nhabit of body; her bowels are much confined, and she exhibits some\r\ngeneral symptoms of febrile derangement, arising, doubtless, from her\r\nprotracted labour. This is her first litter. Upon examination, no young\r\ncould be distinctly felt.\r\n\r\nPlace her in a warm bath, and give her a dose of castor oil, morning and\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n'June' 16.--The bitch appears in the same state as yesterday, except\r\nthat the medicine has operated freely upon the bowels, and the febrile\r\nsymptoms have somewhat decreased. Her strainings are as frequent and\r\ndistressing as ever. Take two scruples of the ergot of rye, and divide\r\ninto six doses, of which let one be given every half hour.\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes after the exhibition of the last dose of this\r\nmedicine, she brought forth, with great difficulty, one dead puppy, upon\r\ntaking which away from her, she became so uneasy that I was induced to\r\nreturn it to her. In about a quarter of an hour after this I paid her\r\nanother visit: the puppy could not now be found; but a suspicious\r\nappearance in the mother's eye betrayed at once that she had devoured\r\nit. I immediately administered an emetic; and in a very short time the\r\nwhole foetus was returned in five distinct parts, viz., the four\r\nquarters and the head. After this, the bitch began to amend very fast;\r\nshe produced no other puppy; and as her supply of milk was small, she\r\nwas soon convalescent.\r\n\r\nTwelve months afterwards she was again taken in labour, about eleven\r\no'clock in the morning, and after very great difficulty, one puppy was\r\nproduced. After this the bitch appeared in great pain, but did not\r\nsucceed in expelling another foetus, in consequence of which I was sent\r\nfor about three o'clock, P.M. I found her very uneasy breathing\r\nlaboriously; the mouth hot, and the bowels costive; but I could not\r\ndiscover any trace of another foetus. She was put into a warm bath, and\r\na dose of opening medicine was administered.\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock she got rid of one dead and two living puppies.\r\n\r\n'2d'. She is still very ill; she evinces great pain when pressed upon\r\nthe abdomen; and it is manifest that she has another foetus within her.\r\nI ordered a dose of the ergot, and in about twenty minutes a large puppy\r\nwas produced, nearly dying. She survived with due care.\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from inserting the following case at considerable\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n'Sept.' 4, 1820.--A very diminutive terrier, weighing not 5 lbs. was\r\nsent to my hospital in order to lie in. She was already restless and\r\npanting. About eight o'clock at night the labour pains commenced; but\r\nuntil eleven scarcely any progress was made. The 'os uteri' would not\r\nadmit my finger, although I frequently attempted it.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven, the membranes began to protrude; at one the head\r\nhad descended into the pelvis and the puppy was dead. In a previous\r\nlabour she had been unable to produce her young, although the ergot of\r\nrye had been freely used. I was obliged to use considerable force, and\r\nshe fought terribly with me throughout the whole process. At half-past\r\none, and after applying considerable force, I brought away a large\r\nfoetus, compared with her own size. On passing my finger as high as\r\npossible, I felt another foetus living, but the night passed and the\r\nwhole of the following day, and she ate and drank, and did not appear to\r\nbe much injured.\r\n\r\nSeveral times in the day I gave her some strong soup and the ergot. Some\r\nslight pains now returned, and by pressing on the belly the nose of the\r\nfoetus was brought to the superior edge of the pelvis. The pains again\r\nceased, the pudenda began to swell from frequent examination, the bitch\r\nbegan to stagger, and made frequent attempts to void her urine, with\r\nextreme difficulty in accomplishing it. I now resorted to the crotchet;\r\nand after many unsuccessful attempts, in which the superior part of the\r\nvagina must have been considerably bruised, I fixed it sufficiently\r\nfirmly to draw the head into the cavity of the pelvis. Here for a while\r\nthe shoulder resisted every attempt which I could make without the\r\ndanger of detruncating the foetus. At length by working at the side of\r\nthe head until my nails were soft and my fingers sore, I extracted one\r\nfore leg. The other was soon brought down; another large puppy was\r\nproduced, but destroyed by the means necessary for its production. This\r\nwas the fruit of two hours' hard work.\r\n\r\nShe was completely exhausted, and scarcely able to stand. When placed on\r\nthe ground she staggered and fell at almost every step. Her efforts to\r\nvoid her urine were frequent and ineffectual.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock I again examined her; the external pudenda were sore and\r\nswelled, and beginning to assume a black hue. It was with considerable\r\ndifficulty that I could introduce my finger. A third foetus irregularly\r\npresented was detected. I could just feel one of the hind legs. No time\r\nwas to be lost. I introduced a small pair of forceps by the side of my\r\nfinger, and succeeded in laying hold of the leg without much difficulty,\r\nand, with two or three weak efforts from the mother,--I could scarcely\r\ncall them pains,--I brought the leg down until it was in the cavity of\r\nthe pelvis. I solicited it forward with my finger, and, by forcibly\r\npressing back the 'labia pudendi', I could just grasp it with the finger\r\nand thumb of the right hand. Holding it there, I introduced the finger\r\nof the right hand, and continued to get down the other leg, and then\r\nfound little difficulty until the head was brought to the superior edge\r\nof the pelvis. After a long interval, and with considerable force, this\r\nwas brought into the pelvis, and another puppy extracted. This fully\r\noccupied two hours.\r\n\r\nThe bitch now appeared almost lifeless. As she was unable to stand, and\r\nseemed unconscious of every thing around her, I concluded that she was\r\nlost: I gave her one or two drops of warm brandy and water, covered her\r\nup closely, and put her to bed.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, on the following morning, she was curled round in her\r\nbasket; she licked my hands, and ate a bit of bread and butter; but when\r\nput on her legs staggered and fell. The pudendum was dreadfully swollen,\r\nand literally black. In the afternoon she again took a little food: she\r\ncame voluntarily from her basket, wagged her tail when spoken to, and on\r\nthe following day she was taken in her basket a journey of 70 miles, and\r\nafterwards did well; no one could be more rejoiced than was her master,\r\nwho was present at, and superintended the greater part of the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n'The beneficial effect of Ergot of Rye in difficult Parturition'.--The\r\nfollowing case is from the pen of Professor Dick:\r\n\r\nOn the 10th instant, a pointer bitch produced two puppies; and it was\r\nthought by the person having her in charge that she had no more. She was\r\nput into a comfortable box, and with a little care was expected to do\r\nwell. On the next morning, however, she was sick and breathed heavily,\r\nand continued rather uneasy all the day.\r\n\r\nOn the forenoon of the following day I was requested to see her. I found\r\nher with her nose dry, breath hot, respiration frequent, mouth hot and\r\nparched, coat staring, back roached, pulse 120, and a black fetid\r\ndischarge from the vagina. Pressure on the abdomen gave pain. A pup\r\ncould be obscurely felt; the secretion of milk was suppressed, and the\r\nskin had lost its natural elasticity.\r\n\r\nTepid water with a little soap dissolved in it was immediately injected\r\ninto the uterus, which in a considerable degree excited its action; and\r\nthis injection was repeated two or three times with the same effect.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for half an hour, the foetus was not discharged nor\r\nbrought forward; therefore a scruple of the ergot of rye was then made\r\ninto an infusion with two ounces of water, and one-third of it given as\r\na dose; in half an hour, another one-third of it; the injections of warm\r\nwater and soap being also continued. Soon after the second dose of the\r\ninfusion, a dead puppy was expelled; the bitch rapidly recovered, and,\r\nwith the exception of deficiency of milk, is now quite well.\r\n\r\nThis case would seem to prove the great power of the ergot of rye over\r\nthe uterus; but, until more experiments are made, it is necessary to be\r\ncautious in ascribing powers to medicines which have not been much tried\r\nin our practice. It is not improbable that the warm water and soap might\r\nhave roused the uterus into action without the aid of the ergot; and it\r\nis therefore necessary that those who repeat this experiment should try\r\nthe effects of the medicine unaided by the auxiliary.\r\n\r\nThe Professor adds, that the great power which this drug is said to have\r\non the human being, and the apparent effect in the case just given,\r\nsuggest the propriety of instituting a further trial of it, and of our\r\nextending our observations to cattle, amongst which difficult cases of\r\ncalving so frequently occur.\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson thus concludes some remarks on ergot in difficult\r\nparturition. This medicine possesses a very great power over the uterus,\r\nrousing its dormant or debilitated contractility, and stimulating it to\r\nan extra performance of this necessary function after its natural energy\r\nhas been in some measure destroyed by forcible but useless action. The\r\ndirect utility of the ergot was manifested in cases where the uterus\r\nappeared quite exhausted by its repeated efforts; and certainly it is\r\nbut fair to ascribe the decidedly augmented power of the organ to the\r\nstimulus of the ergot, for no other means were resorted to in order to\r\nprocure the desired effect. Its action, too, is prompt. Within ten\r\nminutes of the administration of a second or third dose, when nature has\r\nbeen nearly exhausted, the parturition has been safely effected.\r\n\r\n'Puerperal Fits'.\r\nNature, proportions the power and resources of the mother to the wants\r\nof her offspring. In her wild undomesticated state she is able to suckle\r\nher progeny to the full time; but, in the artificial state in which we\r\nhave placed her, we shorten the interval between each period of\r\nparturition, we increase the number of her young ones at each birth, we\r\ndiminish her natural powers of affording them nutriment, and we give her\r\na degree of irritability which renders her whole system liable to be\r\nexcited and deranged by causes that would otherwise be harmless:\r\ntherefore it happens that, when the petted bitch is permitted to suckle\r\nthe whole of her litter, her supply of nutriment soon becomes exhausted,\r\nand the continued drain upon her produces a great degree of\r\nirritability. She gets rapidly thin; she staggers, is half unconscious,\r\nneglects her puppies, and suddenly falls into a fit of a very peculiar\r\ncharacter. It begins with, and is sometimes confined to, the respiratory\r\napparatus: she lies on her side and pants violently, and the sound of\r\nher laboured breathing may be heard at the distance of twenty yards.\r\nSometimes spasms steal over her limbs; at other times the diaphragm and\r\nrespiratory muscles alone are convulsed. In a few hours she is certainly\r\nlost; or, if there are moments of remission, they are speedily succeeded\r\nby increased heavings.\r\n\r\nThe practitioner unaccustomed to this fearful state of excitation, and\r\nforgetful or unaware of its cause, proceeds to bleed her, and he seals\r\nher fate. Although one system is thus convulsively labouring, it is\r\nbecause others are suddenly and perfectly exhausted; and by abstraction\r\nof the vital current he reduces this last hold of life to the helpless\r\ncondition of the rest. There is not a more common or fatal error than\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe veterinary practitioner is unable to apply the tepid bath to his\r\nlarger patients, in order to quiet the erythism of certain parts of the\r\nsystem, and produce an equable diffusion of nervous influence and\r\naction; and he often forgets it when he has it in his power to save the\r\nsmaller ones. Let the bitch in a fit be put into a bath, temperature 96°\r\nFahrenheit, and covered with the water, her head excepted. It will he\r\nsurprising to see how soon the simple application of this equable\r\ntemperament will quiet down the erythism of the excited system. In ten\r\nminutes, or a quarter of an hour, she may be taken out of the bath\r\nevidently relieved, and then, a hasty and not very accurate drying\r\nhaving taken place, she is wrapped in a blanket and placed in some warm\r\nsituation, a good dose of physic having been previously administered.\r\nShe soon breaks out in a profuse perspiration. Everything becomes\r\ngradually quiet, and she falls into a deep and long sleep, and at length\r\nawakes somewhat weak, but to a certain degree restored.\r\n\r\nIf, then, all her puppies except one or two are taken from her, and her\r\nfood is, for a day or two, somewhat restricted, and after that given\r\nagain of its usual quantity and kind, she will live and do well; but a\r\nbleeding at the time of her fit, or suffering all her puppies to return\r\nto her, will inevitably destroy her.\r\n\r\nA bitch that was often brought to my house was suckling a litter of\r\npuppies. She was foolishly taken up and thrown into the Serpentine in\r\nthe month of April. The suppression of milk was immediate and complete.\r\nThere was also a determination to the head, and attacks resembling\r\nepilepsy. The puppies that were suffered to remain with the mother, were\r\nvery soon as epileptic as she was, and were destroyed. A seton was\r\ninserted on each side of her neck. Ipecacuanha was administered; and\r\nthat having sufficiently worked, a small quantity of diluted sulphuric\r\nacid was given. A fortnight afterwards she was perfectly well.\r\n\r\n'Inversion of the Uterus in a Bull Bitch after Pupping. Extirpation\r\nand Cure.'\r\n\r\nBy M. Cross, M. V., Milan.--In July, 1829, I was desired to attend a\r\nsmall bull bitch six years old, and who had had puppies four times. The\r\nuterus was completely inverted, and rested all its weight on the vaginal\r\norifice of the urethra, preventing the discharge of the urine, and thus\r\nbeing the cause of great pain when the animal endeavoured to void it, or\r\nthe faecal matter. The uterus was become of almost a black colour,\r\nswelled, softened, and exhaling an insupportable odour. Judging from\r\nthis that the preservation of the uterus was impossible, and reckoning\r\nmuch on the good constitution of the patient, I warned the proprietor of\r\nthe danger of its reduction, even supposing that it was practicable, and\r\nproposed to him the complete extirpation of the uterus as the only means\r\nthat remained of saving the bitch.\r\n\r\nArmed with his consent, I passed a ligature round the neck of the\r\nuterus, at the bottom of the vagina, and drew it as tight as I possibly\r\ncould. On the following day I again tightened the ligature, in order to\r\ncomplete the mortification of the part, and the separation of the womb.\r\nOn the third day I extirpated the womb entirely, close to the haunch.\r\nThere was very slight loss of blood, but there ran from the walls of the\r\nvagina a small quantity of ichorous fluid, with a strong fetid smell.\r\nThe operation was scarcely completed ere she voided a considerable\r\nquantity of urine, and then searched about for something to eat and to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the uterus that was removed weighed fourteen ounces. The\r\nmucous membrane by which it was lined was in a highly disorganized\r\nstate. From time to time injections of a slight infusion of aromatic\r\nplants were introduced into the vagina, and the animal was nourished\r\nwith liquid food of easy digestion.\r\n\r\nThe first day passed without the animal being in the slightest degree\r\naffected; but, on the following day, in despite of all our care, an\r\nichorous fluid was discharged, which the dog would lick notwithstanding\r\nall our efforts to prevent it. The general health of the animal did not\r\nseem to be in the slightest degree affected.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day after the operation, the cords that had served as a\r\nligature fell off, and all suppuration from the part gradually ceased.\r\n\r\n'October 20th'.--Three months have passed since the operation, and she\r\nis perfectly well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTEMPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this singular name is distinguished a prevalent disease now about to\r\ncome under our consideration, which was first observed on the continent.\r\nThe rapidity with which it spread, the strange protean appearances which\r\nit assumed, and its too frequent fatal termination, surprised and\r\npuzzled the veterinary surgeons; and they called it \"la maladie des\r\nchiens,\" the disease or distemper in dogs.\r\n\r\nIt is comparatively a new disease. It was imported from France about one\r\nhundred years since, although some French authors have strangely\r\naffirmed that it is of British origin. Having once gained footing among\r\nus, it has established itself in our country, to the vexation and loss\r\nof the sportsman, and the annoyance of the veterinary surgeon. However\r\nkeepers, or even men of education, may boast of their specifics, it is a\r\nsadly fatal disease, and destroys fully one-third of the canine race.\r\n\r\nDogs of all ages are subject to its attack. Many, nine and ten years\r\nold, have died of pure distemper; and I have seen puppies of only three\r\nweeks fall victims to it; but it oftenest appears between the sixth and\r\ntwelfth month of the animal's life. If it occurs at an early period, it\r\nproves fatal in the great majority of cases; and, if the dog is more\r\nthan four years old, it generally goes hard with him. It is undeniably\r\nhighly contagious, yet it is frequently generated. In this it bears an\r\nanalogy to mange, and to farcy and glanders in the horse.\r\n\r\nOne attack of the disease, and even a severe one, is no absolute\r\nsecurity against its return; although the dog that has once laboured\r\nunder distemper possesses a certain degree of immunity; or, if he is\r\nattacked a second time, the malady usually assumes a milder type. I\r\nhave, however, known it occur three times in the same animal, and at\r\nlast destroy him.\r\n\r\nViolent catarrh will often terminate in distemper; and low and\r\ninsufficient feeding will produce it. It frequently follows mange, and\r\nespecially if mercury has been used in the cure of the malady. When we\r\nsee a puppy with mange, and that peculiar disease in which the skin\r\nbecomes corrugated, and more especially if it is a spaniel, and\r\npot-bellied or rickety, we generally say that we can cure the mange, but\r\nit will not be long before the animal dies of distemper; and so it\r\nhappens in three cases out of four. Whatever debilitates the\r\nconstitution predisposes it for the reception or the generation of\r\ndistemper. It, however, frequently occurs without any apparent exciting\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThat it is highly contagious cannot admit of doubt. A healthy dog can\r\nseldom, for many days, be kept with another that labours under distemper\r\nwithout becoming affected; and the disease is communicated by the\r\nslightest momentary contact. There is, however, a great deal of caprice\r\nabout this. I have more than once kept a dog in the foul-yard of my\r\nhospital for several successive weeks, and he has not become diseased.\r\nInoculation with the matter that flows from the nose, either limpid or\r\npurulent, and in an early or advanced stage of the distemper, will, with\r\nfew exceptions, produce the disease; yet I have failed to communicate it\r\neven by this method. Inoculation used to be recommended as producing a\r\nmilder and less fatal disease. So far as my experience goes, the\r\ncontrary has been the result.\r\n\r\nDistemper is also epidemic. It occurs more frequently in the spring and\r\nautumn than in the winter and summer. If one or two dogs in a certain\r\ndistrict are affected, we may be assured that it will soon extensively\r\nprevail there; and where the disease could not possibly be communicated\r\nby contagion. Sometimes it rages all over the country. At other times it\r\nis endemic, and confined to some particular district.\r\n\r\nNot only is the disease epidemic or endemic, but the form which it\r\nassumes is so. In one season, almost every dog with distemper has\r\nviolent fits; at another, in the majority of cases, there will be\r\nconsiderable chest affection, running on to pneumonia; a few months\r\nafterwards, a great proportion of the distempered dogs will be worn down\r\nby diarrhoea, which no medicine will arrest; and presently it will be\r\nscarcely distinguishable from mild catarrh.\r\n\r\nIt varies much with different breeds. The shepherd's dog, generally\r\nspeaking, cares little about it; he is scarcely ill a day. The cur is\r\nnot often seriously affected. The terrier has it more severely,\r\nespecially the white terrier. The hound comes next in the order of\r\nseverity; and after him the setter. With the small spaniel it is more\r\ndangerous; and still more so with the pointer, especially if he has the\r\ndisease early. Next in the order of fatality comes the pug; and it is\r\nmost fatal of all with the Newfoundland dog. Should a foreign dog be\r\naffected, he almost certainly dies. The greater part of the northern\r\ndogs brought by Captain Parry did not survive a twelvemonth; and the\r\ndelicate Italian greyhound has little chance, when imported from abroad.\r\n\r\nNot only does it thus differ in different species of dogs, but in\r\ndifferent breeds of the same species. I have known several gentlemen who\r\nhave laboured in vain for many years, to rear particular and valuable\r\nbreeds of pointers and greyhounds. The distemper would uniformly carry\r\noff five out of six. Other sportsmen laugh at the supposed danger of\r\ndistemper, and declare that they seldom lose a dog. This hereditary\r\npredisposition to certain kinds of disease cannot be denied, and is not\r\nsufficiently attended to. When a peculiar fatality has often followed a\r\ncertain breed, the owner should cross it from another kennel, and\r\nespecially from the kennel of one who boasts of his success in the\r\ntreatment of distemper. This has occasionally succeeded far beyond\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nIt is time to proceed to the symptoms of this disease; but here there is\r\nvery considerable difficulty, for it is a truly protean malady, and it\r\nis impossible to fix on any symptom that will invariably characterise\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAn early and frequent symptom is a gradual loss of appetite, spirits,\r\nand condition: the dog is less obedient to his master, and takes less\r\nnotice of him. The eyes appear weak and watery; and there will be a very\r\nslight limpid discharge from the nose. In the morning there will,\r\nperhaps, be a little indurated mucus at the inner corner of the eye.\r\nThis may continue two or three weeks without serious or scarcely\r\nrecognizable illness. Then a peculiar husky cough is heard, altogether\r\ndifferent from the sonorous cough of catarrh, or the wheezing of asthma.\r\nIt is an apparent attempt to get something from the fauces or throat. By\r\ndegrees the discharge from the eyes and nose, and particularly the\r\nformer, will increase. More mucus will collect in the corners of the\r\neye; and the eye will sometimes be closed in the morning. The\r\nconjunctiva and particularly that portion which covers the sclerotica,\r\nwill be considerably injected, but there will not be the usual intense\r\nredness of inflammation. The vessels will be large and turgid rather\r\nthan numerous, and frequently of a darkish hue.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, however, the inflammation of the conjunctiva will be\r\nexceedingly intense, the membrane vividly red, and the eye impatient of\r\nlight. An opacity spreads over the cornea, and this is quickly succeeded\r\nby ulceration. The first spot of ulceration is generally found precisely\r\nin the centre of the cornea, and is perfectly circular; this will\r\ndistinguish it from a scratch or other injury. The ulcer widens and\r\ndeepens, and sometimes eats through the cornea, and the aqueous humour\r\nescapes. Fungous granulations spring from it, protrude through the lids,\r\nand the animal evidently suffers extreme torture.\r\n\r\nA remarkable peculiarity attends this affection of the eye. However\r\nviolent may be the inflammation, and by whatever disorganization it may\r\nbe accompanied, if we can cure the distemper, the granulations will\r\ndisappear, the ulcer will heal, the opacity will clear away, and the eye\r\nwill not eventually suffer in the slightest degree. One-fourth part of\r\nthe mischief in other cases, unconnected with distemper, would\r\ninevitably terminate in blindness; but permanent blindness is rarely the\r\nconsequence of distemper.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper here shortly to revert to the different\r\nappearance of the eye in rabies. In the early stage of this malady there\r\nis an unnatural and often terrific brightness of the eye; but the cornea\r\nin distemper is from the first rather clouded. In rabies there is\r\nfrequent strabismus, with the axis of the eye distorted outwards. The\r\napparent squinting of the eye in distemper is caused by the probably\r\nunequal protrusion of the membrana nictitans over a portion of the eye\r\nat the inner canthus, in order to protect it from the light. In rabies,\r\nthe white cloudiness which I have described, and the occasional\r\nulceration with very little cloudiness, and the ulceration, are confined\r\nto the cornea; but a dense green opacity comes on, speedily followed by\r\nulceration and disorganization of every part of the eye.\r\n\r\nThe dog will, at this stage of distemper, be evidently feverish, and\r\nwill shiver and creep to the fire. He will more evidently and rapidly\r\nlose flesh. The huskiness will be more frequent and troublesome, and the\r\ndischarge from the nose will have greater consistence. It will be often\r\nand violently sneezed out, and will gradually become more or less\r\npurulent. It will stick about the nostrils and plug them up, and thus\r\nafford a considerable mechanical obstruction to the breathing.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the disease is now uncertain. Sometimes fits come on,\r\nspeedily following intense inflammation of the eye; or the inflammation\r\nof the nasal cavity appears to be communicated, by proximity, to the\r\nmembrane of the brain. One fit is a serious thing. If it is followed by\r\na second within a day or two, the chances of cure are diminished; and if\r\nthey rapidly succeed each other, the dog is almost always lost. These\r\nfits seldom appear without warning; and, if their approach is carefully\r\nwatched, they may possibly be prevented.\r\n\r\nHowever indisposed to eat the dog may previously have been, the appetite\r\nreturns when the fits are at hand, and the animal becomes absolutely\r\nvoracious. Nature seems to be providing for the great expenditure of\r\npower which epilepsy will soon occasion. The mucus almost entirely\r\ndisappears from the eyes, although the discharge from the nose may\r\ncontinue unabated; and for an hour or more before the fit there will be\r\na champing of the lower jaw, frothing at the mouth, and discharge of\r\nsaliva. The champing of the lower jaw will be seen at least twelve hours\r\nbefore the first fit, and will a little while precede every other. There\r\nwill also be twitchings of some part of the frame, and usually of the\r\nmouth, cheek, or eyelid. It is of some consequence to attend to these,\r\nas enabling us to distinguish between fits of distemper and those of\r\nteething, worms, or unusual excitement. The latter come on suddenly. The\r\ndog is apparently well, and racing about full of spirits, and without a\r\nmoment's warning he falls into violent convulsions.\r\n\r\nWe may here, likewise, be enabled to distinguish between rabies and\r\ndistemper. When a person, unacquainted with dogs, sees a dog struggling\r\nin a fit, or running along unconscious of every surrounding object, or\r\nsnapping at everything in his way, whether it be a human being or a\r\nstone, he raises the cry of \"mad dog,\" and the poor brute is often\r\nsacrificed. The very existence of a fit is proof positive that the dog\r\nis not mad. No epilepsy accompanies rabies in any stage of that disease.\r\n\r\nThe inflammation of the membrane of the nose and fauces is sometimes\r\npropagated along that of the windpipe, and the dog exhibits unequivocal\r\nproofs of chest affection, or decided pneumonia.\r\n\r\nAt other times the bowels become affected, and a violent purging comes\r\non. The fæces vary from white with a slight tinge of gray, to a dark\r\nslate or olive colour. By degrees mucus begins to mingle with the fæcal\r\ndischarge, and then streaks of blood. The fæcal matter rapidly lessens,\r\nand the whole seems to consist of mingled mucus and blood; and, from\r\nfirst to last, the stools are insufferably offensive. When the mingled\r\nblood and mucus appear, so much inflammation exists in the intestinal\r\ncanal that the case is almost hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe discharge from the nose becomes decidedly purulent. While it is\r\nwhite and without smell, and the dog is not too much emaciated, the\r\ntermination may be favourable; but when it becomes of a darker colour,\r\nand mingled with blood, and offensive, the ethmoid or turbinated bones\r\nare becoming carious, and death supervenes. This will particularly be\r\nthe case if the mouth and lips swell, and ulcers begin to appear on\r\nthem, and the gums ulcerate, and a sanious and highly offensive\r\ndischarge proceeds from the mouth. A singular, half-fetid smell arising\r\nfrom the dog, is the almost invariable precursor of death.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease first visited the continent, it was regarded as a\r\nhumoral disease. Duhamel, who was one of the earliest to study the\r\ncharacter of the malady, contended that the biliary sac contained the\r\ncause of the complaint; the bile assumed a concrete form, and its\r\nsuperabundance was the cause of disease. Barrier, one of the earliest\r\nwriters on the subject, described it as a violent irregular bilious\r\nfever. Others regarded it as a mucous discharge, or a depurative; and\r\nothers, as a salutary crisis, removing from the constitution that which\r\noppressed the different organs. Others had recourse to inoculation, in\r\norder to give it a more benign character; and others, and among them\r\nChabert, considered that it possessed a character of peculiar malignity,\r\nand he gave it a name expressive of its nature and situation--'nasal\r\ncatarrh'. It exhibited the ordinary symptoms of coryza: it was a\r\ncatarrhal affection in its early stage; but it afterwards degenerated\r\ninto a species of palsy. The causes were unknown. By some, they were\r\nattributed to the natural voracity of the dog; by others, to his\r\noccasional lasciviousness; by others, to his frequent feeding on\r\ncarrion, or the refuse of fat and soups.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that nasal catarrh is, to a very considerable degree,\r\ncontagious on the continent. It often spreads over a wide extent of\r\ncountry, and includes numerous animals of various descriptions. It is\r\ncomplicated with various diseases; and particularly, at an early stage,\r\nwith ophthalmia. It may be interesting to the reader to trace the\r\nprogress of the disease among our continental neighbours. It commences\r\nwith a certain depression of spirits; a diminution of appetite; a\r\nheaviness of the head; a heat of the mouth; an attempt to get something\r\nfrom the throat; an insatiable thirst; an elevated temperature of the\r\nbody; a dry and painful suffocating cough; and all these circumstances\r\ncontinue twenty to thirty days, until at length the dog droops and dies.\r\n\r\nThe duration of distemper is uncertain. It sometimes runs its course in\r\nfive or six days; or it may linger on two or three months. In some cases\r\nthe emaciation is rapid and extreme: danger is then to be apprehended.\r\nWhen the muscles of the loins are much attenuated, or almost wasted,\r\nthere is little hope; and, although other symptoms may remit, and the\r\ndog may be apparently recovering, yet, if he continues to lose flesh, we\r\nmay be perfectly assured that he will not live. On the other hand, let\r\nthe discharge from the nose be copious, and the purging violent, and\r\nevery other symptom threatening, yet if the animal gains a little flesh,\r\nwe may confidently predict his recovery.\r\n\r\nWhen the dog is much reduced in strength and flesh, a spasmodic\r\naffection or twitching of the muscles will sometimes be observed. It is\r\nusually confined at first to one limb; but the most decisive treatment\r\nis required, or these spasms will spread until the animal is altogether\r\nunable to stand; and while he lies every limb will be in motion,\r\ntravelling, as it were, at the rate of twenty miles an hour, until the\r\nanimal is worn out, and dies of absolute exhaustion. When these spasms\r\nbecome universal and violent, they are accompanied by constant and\r\ndreadful moans and cries.\r\n\r\nIn the pointer and the hound, and particularly when there is little\r\ndischarge from the eyes or nose, an intense yellowness often suddenly\r\nappears all over the dog. He falls away more in twenty-four hours than\r\nit would be thought possible; his bowels are obstinately constipated; he\r\nwill neither eat nor move; and in two or three days he is dead.\r\n\r\nIn the pointer, hound, and greyhound, there sometimes appears on the\r\nwhole of the chest and belly a pustular eruption, which peels off in\r\nlarge scales. The result is usually unfavourable. A more general\r\neruption, however, either wearing the usual form of mange, or\r\naccompanied by minute pustules, may be regarded as a favourable symptom.\r\nThe disease is leaving the vital parts, and expending its last energy on\r\nthe integument.\r\n\r\nThe 'post-mortem' appearances are exceedingly unsatisfactory: they do\r\nnot correspond with the original character of the disease, but with its\r\nstrangely varying symptoms. If the dog has died in fits, we have\r\ninflammation of the brain or its membranes, and particularly at the base\r\nof the brain, with considerable effusion of a serous or bloody fluid. If\r\nthe prevailing symptoms have led our attention to the lungs, we find\r\ninflammation of the bronchial passages, or, in a few instances, of the\r\nsubstance of the lungs, or the submucous tissue of the cells. We rarely\r\nhave inflammation of the pulmonary pleura, and never to any extent of\r\nthe intercostal pleura. In a few lingering cases, tubercles and vomicæ\r\nof the lungs have been found.\r\n\r\nIf the bowels have been chiefly attacked, we have intense inflammation\r\nof the mucous membrane, and, generally speaking, the small intestines\r\nare almost filled with worms. If the dog has gradually wasted away,\r\nwhich is often the case when purging to any considerable extent has been\r\nencouraged or produced, we have contraction of the whole canal,\r\nincluding even the stomach, and sometimes considerable enlargement of\r\nthe mesenteric glands [1].\r\n\r\nThe membrane of the nose will always exhibit marks of inflammation, and\r\nparticularly in the frontal sinuses and ethmoidal cells; and I have\r\nobserved the portion of membrane on the septum, or cartilaginous\r\ndivision of the nostrils, between the frontal sinuses and ethmoidal\r\ncells, to be studded with small miliary tubercles. In advanced stages of\r\nthe disease, attended with much defluxion from the nose, the cells of\r\nthe ethmoidal bone and the frontal sinuses are filled with pus.\r\n\r\nUlceration is sometimes found on the membrane of the nose, oftenest on\r\nthe spot to which I have referred--occasionally confined to that; and\r\nnow and then spreading over the whole of the septum, and even corroding\r\nand eating through it; generally equal on both sides of the septum; in a\r\nfew instances extending into the fauces; seldom found in the larynx, but\r\noccasionally seen in the bronchial passages. The other viscera rarely\r\npresent any remarkable morbid appearance.\r\n\r\nThe distemper is clearly a disease of the mucous membranes, usually\r\ncommencing in the membrane of the nose, and resembling nasal catarrh. In\r\nthe early stage it is 'coryza', or nasal catarrh; but the affection\r\nrapidly extends, and seems to attack the mucous membranes generally,\r\ndetermined to some particular one, either by atmospheric influence or\r\naccidental causes, or constitutional predisposition. The fits arise from\r\ngeneral disturbance of the system, or from the proximity of the brain to\r\nthe early seat of inflammation.\r\n\r\nThis account of the nature and treatment of distemper will, perhaps, be\r\nunsatisfactory to some readers. One thing, however, is clear, that for a\r\ndisease which assumes such a variety of forms, there can be no specific;\r\nyet there is not a keeper who is not in possession of some supposed\r\ninfallible nostrum. Nothing can be more absurd. A disease attacking so\r\nmany organs, and presenting so many and such different symptoms, must\r\nrequire a mode of treatment varying with the organ attacked and the\r\nsymptom prevailing. The faith in these boasted specifics is principally\r\nfounded on two circumstances--atmospheric influence and peculiarity of\r\nbreed. There are some seasons when we can scarcely save a dog; there are\r\nothers when we must almost wilfully destroy him in order to lose him.\r\nThere are some breeds in which, generation after generation, five out of\r\nsix die of distemper, while there are others in which not one out of a\r\ndozen dies. When the season is favourable, and the animal, by hereditary\r\ninfluence, is not disposed to assume the virulent type of the disease,\r\nthese two important agents are overlooked, and the immunity from any\r\nfatal result is attributed to medicine. The circumstances most conducive\r\nto success will be the recollection that it is a disease of the mucous\r\nsurfaces, and that we must not carry the depleting and lowering system\r\ntoo far. Keeping this in view, we must accommodate ourselves to the\r\nsymptoms as they arise.\r\n\r\nThe natural medicine of the dog seems to be an emetic. The act of\r\nvomiting is very easily excited in him, and, feeling the slightest\r\nailment, he flies to the dog-grass, unloads his stomach, and is at once\r\nwell. In distemper, whatever be the form which it assumes, an emetic is\r\nthe first thing to be given. Common salt will do when nothing else is at\r\nhand; but the best emetic, and particularly in distemper, consists of\r\nequal parts of calomel and tartar emetic. From half a grain to a grain\r\nand a half of each will constitute the dose.\r\n\r\nThis will act first as an emetic, and afterwards as a gentle purgative.\r\nThen, if the cough is urgent, and there is heaving at the flanks, and\r\nthe nose is hot, a moderate quantity of blood may be taken--from three\r\nto twelve ounces--and this, if there has been previous constipation, may\r\nbe followed by a dose of sulphate of magnesia, from two to six drachms.\r\n\r\nIn slight cases this will often be sufficient to effect a cure: but, if\r\nthe dog still droops, and particularly if there is much huskiness, the\r\nantimonial or James's powder, nitre and digitalis, in the proportion of\r\nfrom half a grain to a grain of digitalis, from two to five grains of\r\nthe James's powder, and from a scruple to a drachm of nitre, should be\r\nadministered twice or thrice in a day. If on the third or fourth day the\r\nhuskiness is not quite removed, the emetic should be repeated.\r\n\r\nIn these affections of the mucous membranes, it is absolutely necessary\r\nto avoid or to get rid of every source of irritation, and worms will\r\ngenerally be found a very considerable one in young dogs. If we can\r\nspeedily get rid of them, distemper will often rapidly disappear; but,\r\nif they are suffered to remain, diarrhoea or fits are apt to supervene:\r\ntherefore some worm medicine should be administered.\r\n\r\nI have said that vomiting is very easily excited in the dog; and that\r\nfor this reason we are precluded from the use of a great many medicines\r\nin our treatment of him. Calomel, aloes, jalap, scammony, and gamboge\r\nwill generally produce sickness. We are, therefore, driven to some\r\nmechanical vermifuge; and a very effectual one, and that will rarely\r\nfail of expelling even the tape-worm, is tin filings or powdered glass.\r\nFrom half a drachm to a drachm of either may be advantageously given\r\ntwice in the day. There may generally be added to them digitalis,\r\nJames's powder, and nitre, made into balls with palm oil and a little\r\nlinseed meal. This course should be pursued in usual cases until two or\r\nthree emetics have been given, and a ball morning and night on the\r\nintermediate days. Should the huskiness not diminish after the first two\r\nor three days, if the dog has not rapidly lost flesh, I should be\r\ndisposed to take a little more blood, and to put a seton in the poll. It\r\nshould be inserted between the ears, and reaching from ear to ear.\r\n\r\nWhen there is fever and huskiness, and the dog is not much emaciated, a\r\nseton is an excellent remedy; but, if it is used indiscriminately, and\r\nwhen the animal is already losing ground, and is violently purging, we\r\nshall only hasten his doom, or rather make it more sure.\r\n\r\nIt is now, if ever, that pneumonia will be perceived. The symptoms of\r\ninflammation in the lungs of the dog can scarcely be mistaken. The quick\r\nand laborious breathing, the disinclination or inability to lie down,\r\nthe elevated position of the head, and the projection of the muzzle,\r\nwill clearly mark it. More blood must be subtracted, a seton inserted,\r\nthe bowels opened with Epsom salts, and the digitalis, nitre, and\r\nJames's powder given more frequently and in larger doses than before.\r\n\r\nLittle aid is to be derived from observation of the pulse of the dog; it\r\ndiffers materially in the breed, and size, and age of the animal. Many\r\nyears' practice have failed in enabling me to draw any certain\r\nconclusion from it. The best place to feel the pulse of the dog is at\r\nthe side. We may possibly learn from it whether digitalis is producing\r\nan intermittent pulse, which it frequently will do, and which we wish\r\nthat it should do: it should then be given a little more cautiously, and\r\nin smaller quantities.\r\n\r\nIf the pneumonia is evidently conquered, or we have proceeded thus far\r\nwithout any considerable inflammatory affection of the chest, we must\r\nbegin to change our plan of treatment. If the huskiness continues, and\r\nthe discharge from the nose is increased and thicker, and the animal is\r\nlosing flesh and becoming weak, we must give only half the quantity of\r\nthe sedative and diuretic medicine, and add some mild tonic, as gentian,\r\nchamomile, and ginger, with occasional emetics, taking care to keep the\r\nbowels in a laxative but not purging state. The dog should likewise be\r\nurged to eat; and, if he obstinately refuses ail food, he should be\r\nforced with strong beef jelly, for a very great degree of debility will\r\nnow ensue\r\n\r\nWe have thus far considered the treatment of distemper from its\r\ncommencement; but it may have existed several days before we were\r\nconsulted, and the dog may be thin and husky, and refusing to eat. In\r\nsuch case we should give an emetic, and then a dose of salts, and after\r\nthat proceed to the tonic and fever balls.\r\n\r\nShould the strength of the animal continue to decline, and the discharge\r\nfrom the nose become purulent and offensive, the fever medicine must be\r\nomitted, and the tonic balls, with carbonate of iron, administered. Some\r\nveterinary surgeons are very fond of gum resins and balsams. Mr. Blaine,\r\nin his excellent treatise on the distemper in his Canine Pathology,\r\nrecommends myrrh and benjamin, and balsam of Peru and camphor. I much\r\ndoubt the efficacy of these drugs. They are beginning to get into\r\ndisrepute in the practice of human medicine; and I believe that if they\r\nwere all banished from the veterinary Materia Medica we should\r\nexperience no loss. When the dog begins to recover, although not so\r\nrapidly as we could wish, the tonic balls, without the iron, may be\r\nadvantageously given, with now and then an emetic, if huskiness should\r\nthreaten to return; but mild and wholesome food, and country or good\r\nair, will be the best tonics.\r\n\r\nIf the discharge from the nose become very offensive, the lips swelled\r\nand ulcerated, and the breath fetid, half an ounce of yeast may be\r\nadministered every noon, and the tonics morning and night; and the mouth\r\nshould be frequently washed with a solution of chloride of lime.\r\n\r\nAt this period of the disease the sub-maxillary glands are sometimes\r\nvery much enlarged, and a tumour or abscess is formed, which, if not\r\ntimely opened, breaks, and a ragged, ill-conditioned ulcer is formed,\r\nvery liable to spread, and very difficult to heal. It is prudent to\r\npuncture this tumour as soon as it begins to point, for it will never\r\ndisperse. After the opening, a poultice should be applied to cleanse the\r\nulcer; after which it should be daily washed with the compound tincture\r\nof benjamin, and dressed with calamine ointment. Some balls should be\r\ngiven, and the animal liberally fed.\r\n\r\nShould the fits appear in an early stage, give a strong emetic; then\r\nbleed, and open the bowels with five or six grains of calomel and a\r\nquarter grain of opium: after this insert a seton, and then commence the\r\ntonic balls.\r\n\r\nThe progress of fits in the early stages of the disease may thus be\r\narrested. The occurrence of two or three should not make us despair;\r\nbut, if they occur at a later period, and when the dog is much reduced,\r\nthere is little hope. This additional expenditure of animal power will\r\nprobably soon carry him off. All that is to be done, is to administer a\r\nstrong emetic, obviate costiveness by castor oil, and give the tonic\r\nballs with opium.\r\n\r\nOf the treatment of the yellow disease little can be said; we shall not\r\nsucceed in one case in twenty. When good effect has been produced, it\r\nhas been by one large bleeding, opening the bowels well with Epsom\r\nsalts, and then giving grain doses of calomel twice a day in a tonic\r\nball.\r\n\r\nWhile it is prudent to obviate costiveness, we should recollect that\r\nthere is nothing more to be dreaded, in every stage of distemper, than\r\ndiarrhoea. The purging of distemper will often bid defiance to the most\r\npowerful astringents. This shows the folly of giving violent cathartics\r\nin distemper; and, when I have heard of the ten, and twenty, and thirty\r\ngrains of calomel that are sometimes given, I have thought it fortunate\r\nthat the stomach of the dog is so irritable. The greater part of these\r\nkill-or-cure doses is ejected, otherwise the patient would soon be\r\ncarried off by super-purgation. There is an irritability about the whole\r\nof the mucous membrane that may be easily excited, but cannot be so\r\nreadily allayed; and, therefore, except in the earliest stage of\r\ndistemper, or in fits, or limiting ourselves to the small portion of\r\ncalomel which enters into our emetic, I would never give a stronger\r\npurgative than castor-oil or Epsom salts. It is of the utmost\r\nconsequence that the purging of distemper should be checked as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn some diseases a sudden purging, and even one of considerable\r\nviolence, constitutes what is called the crisis. It is hailed as a\r\nfavourable symptom, and from that moment the animal begins to recover;\r\nbut this is never the case in distemper: it is a morbid action which is\r\nthen going on, and which produces a dangerous degree of debility.\r\n\r\nThe proper treatment of purging in cases of distemper, is first to give\r\na good dose of Epsom salts, in order to carry away anything that may\r\noffend, and then to ply the animal with mingled absorbents and\r\nastringents. A scruple of powdered chalk, ten grains of catechu, and\r\nfive of ginger, with a quarter of a grain of opium, made into a ball\r\nwith palm oil, may be given to a middle-sized dog twice or thrice every\r\nday. To this may be added injections of gruel, with the compound chalk\r\nmixture and opium.\r\n\r\nWhen the twitchings which I have described begin to appear, a seton is\r\nnecessary, whatever may be the degree to which the animal is reduced.\r\nSome stimulating embrocation, such as tincture of cantharides, may be\r\nrubbed along the whole course of the spine; and the medicine which has\r\noftenest, but not always, succeeded, is castor-oil, syrup of buckthorn,\r\nand syrup of white poppies, given morning and night, and a tonic ball at\r\nnoon. If the dog will not now feed, he should be forced with strong\r\nsoup. As soon, however, as the spasms spread over him, accompanied by a\r\nmoaning that increases to a cry, humanity demands that we put an end to\r\nthat which we cannot cure. Until this happens I would not despair; for\r\nmany dogs have been saved that have lain several days perfectly\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\nAs to the chorea which I have mentioned as an occasional sequel of\r\ndistemper, if the dog is in tolerable condition, and especially if he is\r\ngaining flesh, and the spring or summer is approaching, there is a\r\nchance of his doing well. A seton is the first thing; the bowels should\r\nbe preserved from constipation; and the nitrate of silver, in doses of\r\none-eighth of a grain, made into a pill with linseed meal, and increased\r\nto a quarter of a grain, should be given morning and night.\r\n\r\nWe should never make too sure of the recovery of a distempered dog, nor\r\ncommit ourselves by too early a prognosis. It is a treacherous disease;\r\nthe medicines should be continued until every symptom has fairly\r\ndisappeared; and for a month at least.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to add the following account of the distemper in\r\ndogs, by Dr. Jenner. Several of our modern writers have copied very\r\nclosely from him.\r\n\r\n  \"That disease among dogs which has familiarly been called the\r\n  'distemper,' has not hitherto, I believe, been, much noticed by\r\n  medical men. My situation in the country favouring my wishes to make\r\n  some observations on this singular malady, I availed myself of it,\r\n  during several successive years, among a large number of foxhounds\r\n  belonging to the Earl of Berkeley; and, from observing how frequently\r\n  it has been confounded with hydrophobia, I am induced to lay the\r\n  result of my inquiries before the Medical and Chirurgical Society. It\r\n  may be difficult, perhaps, precisely to ascertain the period of its\r\n  first appearance in Britain. In this and the neighbouring counties, I\r\n  have not been able to trace it back beyond the middle of the last\r\n  century; but it has since spread universally. I knew a gentleman who,\r\n  about forty-five years ago, destroyed the greater part of his hounds,\r\n  from supposing them mad, when the distemper first broke out among\r\n  them; so little was it then known by those most conversant with dogs.\r\n  On the continent I find it has been known for a much longer period; it\r\n  is as contagious among dogs as the small-pox, measles, or scarlet\r\n  fever among the human species; and the contagious miasmata, like those\r\n  arising from the diseases just mentioned, retain their infectious\r\n  properties a long time after separation from the distempered animal.\r\n  Young hounds, for example, brought in a state of health into a kennel,\r\n  where others have gone through the distemper, seldom escape it. I have\r\n  endeavoured to destroy the contagion by ordering every part of a\r\n  kennel to be carefully washed with water, then whitewashed, and\r\n  finally to be repeatedly fumigated with the vapour of marine acid, but\r\n  without any good result.\r\n\r\n  \"The dogs generally sicken early in the second week after exposure to\r\n  the contagion; it is more commonly a violent disease than otherwise,\r\n  and cuts off at least one in three that are attacked by it. It\r\n  commences with inflammation of the substance of the lungs, and\r\n  generally of the mucous membrane of the bronchi. The inflammation at\r\n  the same time seizes on the membranes of the nostrils, and those\r\n  lining the bones of the nose, particularly the nasal portion of the\r\n  ethmoid bone. These membranes are often inflamed to such a degree as\r\n  to occasion extravasation of blood, which I have observed coagulated\r\n  on their surface. The breathing is short and quick, and the breath is\r\n  often fetid; the teeth are covered with a dark mucus. There is\r\n  frequently a vomiting of a glairy fluid. The dog commonly refuses\r\n  food, but his thirst seems insatiable, and nothing cheers him like the\r\n  sight of water. The bowels, although generally constipated as the\r\n  disease advances, are frequently affected with diarrhoea at its\r\n  commencement. The eyes are inflamed, and the sight is often obscured\r\n  by mucus secreted from the eyelids, or by opacity of the cornea. The\r\n  brain is often affected as early as the second day after the attack;\r\n  the animal becomes stupid, and his general habits are changed. In this\r\n  state, if not prevented by loss of strength, he sometimes wanders from\r\n  his home. He is frequently endeavouring to expel by forcible\r\n  expirations the mucus from the trachea and fauces, with a peculiar\r\n  rattling noise. His jaws are generally smeared with it, and it\r\n  sometimes flows out in a frothy state, from his frequent champing.\r\n\r\n  \"During the progress of the disease, especially in its advanced\r\n  stages, he is disposed to bite and gnaw anything within his reach; he\r\n  has sometimes epileptic fits, and a quick succession of general though\r\n  slight convulsive spasms of the muscles. If the dog survive, this\r\n  affection of the muscles continues through life. He is often attacked\r\n  with fits of a different description; he first staggers, then tumbles,\r\n  rolls, cries as if whipped, and tears up the ground with his teeth and\r\n  fore feet: he then lies down senseless and exhausted. On recovering,\r\n  he gets up, moves his tail, looks placid, comes to a whistle, and\r\n  appears in every respect much better than before the attack. The eyes,\r\n  during this paroxysm, look bright, and, unless previously rendered dim\r\n  by mucus, or opacity of the cornea, seem as if they were starting from\r\n  their sockets. He becomes emaciated, and totters from feebleness in\r\n  attempting to walk, or from a partial paralysis of the hind legs. In\r\n  this state he sometimes lingers on till the third or fourth week, and\r\n  then either begins to show signs of returning health (which seldom\r\n  happens when the symptoms have continued with this degree of\r\n  violence), or expires. During convalescence, he has sometimes, though\r\n  rarely, profuse hæmorrhage from the nose.\r\n\r\n  \"When the inflammation of the lungs is very severe, he frequently dies\r\n  on the third day. I know one instance of a dog dying within\r\n  twenty-four hours after the seizure; and in that short space of time\r\n  the greater portion of the lungs was, from exudation, converted into a\r\n  substance nearly as solid as the liver of a sound animal. In this case\r\n  the liver itself was considerably inflamed, and the eyes and flesh\r\n  universally were tinged with yellow, though I did not observe anything\r\n  obstructing the biliary ducts. In other instances I have also observed\r\n  the eyes looking yellow.\r\n\r\n  \"The above is a description of the disease in its several forms; but\r\n  in this, as in the diseases of the human body, there is every\r\n  gradation in its violence.\r\n\r\n  \"There is also another affinity to some human diseases, viz., that the\r\n  animal which has once gone through it very rarely meets with a second\r\n  attack. Fortunately this distemper is not communicable to man. Neither\r\n  the effluvia from the diseased dog nor the bite have proved in any\r\n  instance infectious; but, as it has often been confounded with canine\r\n  madness, as I have before observed, it is to be wished that it were\r\n  more generally understood; for those who are bitten by a dog in this\r\n  state are sometimes thrown into such perturbation that hydrophobia\r\n  symptoms have actually arisen from the workings of the imagination.\r\n  Mr. John Hunter used to speak of a case somewhat of this description\r\n  in his lectures.\r\n\r\n  \"A gentleman who received a severe bite from a dog, soon after fancied\r\n  the animal was mad. He felt a horror at the sight of liquids, and was\r\n  actually convulsed on attempting to swallow them. So uncontrollable\r\n  were his prepossessions, that Mr. Hunter conceived he would have died\r\n  had not the dog which inflicted the wound been found and brought into\r\n  his room in perfect health. This soon restored his mind to a state of\r\n  tranquillity. The sight of water no longer afflicted him, and he\r\n  quickly recovered.\" [2]\r\n\r\nPalsy, more or less complete, is sometimes the termination of the\r\ndistemper in dogs.\r\n\r\nIt is usually accompanied by chorea, and it is then, in the majority of\r\ncases, hopeless. Setons should be inserted in the poll, being then, as\r\nnearly as possible, at the commencement of the spinal cord. They should\r\nbe well stimulated and worn a considerable time. If they fail, a plaster\r\ncomposed of common pitch, with a very small quantity of yellow wax and\r\nsome powdered cantharides, spread on sheep's-skin, should be placed over\r\nthe whole of the lumbar and sacral regions, extending half-way down the\r\nthigh on either side. The bowels should be kept open by mild aperients,\r\nin order that every source of irritation may be removed from the\r\nintestinal canal. Some mild and general tonic will likewise be useful,\r\nsuch as gentian and ginger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following is a very frequent and unexaggerated history\r\nof distemper, when calomel has been given in too powerful doses:\r\n\r\n'August 30, 1828'.--A spaniel, six months old, has been ailing a\r\nfortnight, and three doses of calomel have been given by the owner.

It appeared to be propagated from dog to dog by contagion.\r\nIt was not difficult of cure; and it quickly disappeared when no other\r\nremedies were employed than mild aperients and diaphoretics. A sheep was\r\ninoculated from one of these dogs. There was a slight eruption of\r\npustules formed on the place of inoculation, but nowhere else; nor was\r\nthere the least fever.\r\n\r\nAt another time, also, at the school at Lyons, a sheep died of the\r\nregular sheep-pox. A part of the skin was fastened, during\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, on a healthy sheep, and the other part of it on a\r\ndog, both of them being in apparent good health. No effect was produced\r\non the dog, but the sheep died of confluent sheep-pox.\r\n\r\nThe essential symptoms of small-pox in dogs succeed each other in the\r\nfollowing order: the skin of the belly, the groin, and the inside of the\r\nfore arm, becomes of a redder colour than in its natural state, and\r\nsprinkled with small red spots irregularly rounded. They are sometimes\r\nisolated, sometimes clustered together. The near approach of this\r\neruption is announced by an increase of fever.\r\n\r\nOn the second day the spots are larger, and the integument is slightly\r\ntumefied at the centre of each.\r\n\r\nOn the third day the spots are generally enlarged, and the skin is still\r\nmore prominent at the centre.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day the summit of the tumour is yet more prominent.\r\nTowards the end of that day, the redness of the centre begins to assume\r\na somewhat gray colour. On the following days, the pustules take on\r\ntheir peculiar characteristic appearance, and cannot be confounded with\r\nany other eruption, On the summit is a white circular point,\r\ncorresponding with a certain quantity of nearly transparent fluid which\r\nit contains, and covered by a thin and transparent pellicle. This fluid\r\nbecomes less and less transparent, until it acquires the colour and\r\nconsistence of pus. The pustule, during its serous state, is of a\r\nrounded form. It is flattened when the fluid acquires a purulent\r\ncharacter, and even slightly depressed towards the close of the period\r\nof suppuration, and when that of desiccation is about to commence, which\r\nordinarily happens towards the ninth or tenth day of the eruption. The\r\ndesiccation and the desquamation occupy an exceedingly variable length\r\nof time; and so, indeed, do all the different periods of the disease.\r\nWhat is the least inconstant, is the duration of the serous eruption,\r\nwhich is about four days, if it has been distinctly produced and guarded\r\nfrom all friction. If the general character of the pustules is\r\nconsidered, it will be observed, that, while some of them are in a state\r\nof serous secretion, others will only have begun to appear.\r\n\r\nThe eruption terminates when desiccation commences in the first\r\npustules; and, if some red spots show themselves at that period of the\r\nmalady, they disappear without being followed by the development of\r\npustules. They are a species of abortive pustules. After the\r\ndesiccation, the skin remains covered by brown spots, which, by degrees,\r\ndie away. There remains no trace of the disease, except a few\r\nsuperficial cicatrices on which the hair does not grow.\r\n\r\nThe causes which produce the greatest variation in the periods of the\r\neruption are, the age of the dog, and the temperature of the situation\r\nand of the season. The eruption runs through its different stages with\r\nmuch more rapidity in dogs from one to five months old than in those of\r\ngreater age. I have never seen it in dogs more than eighteen months old.\r\nAn elevated temperature singularly favours the eruption, and also\r\nrenders it confluent and of a serous character. A cold atmosphere is\r\nunfavourable to the eruption, or even prevents it altogether. Death is\r\nalmost constantly the result of the exposure of dogs having small-pox to\r\nany considerable degree of cold. A moderate temperature is most\r\nfavourable to the recovery of the animal. A frequent renewal or change\r\nof air, the temperature remaining nearly the same, is highly favourable\r\nto the patient; consequently close boxes or kennels should be altogether\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nI have often observed, that the perspiration or breath of dogs labouring\r\nunder variola emits a very unpleasant odour. This smell is particularly\r\nobserved at the commencement of the desiccation of the pustules, and\r\nwhen the animals are lying upon dry straw; for the friction of the bed\r\nagainst the pustules destroys their pellicles, and permits the purulent\r\nmatter to escape; and the influence of this purulent matter is most\r\npernicious. The fever is increased, and also the unpleasant smell from\r\nthe mouth, and that of the fæces. In this state there is a disposition\r\nwhich is rapidly developed in the lungs to assume the character of\r\npneumonia. This last complication is a most serious one, and almost\r\nalways terminates fatally. It has a peculiar character. It shows itself\r\nsuddenly, and with all its alarming symptoms. It is almost immediately\r\naccompanied by a purulent secretion from the bronchi, and the second day\r\ndoes not pass without the characters of pneumonia being completely\r\ndeveloped. The respiration is accompanied by a mucous 'râle' which often\r\nbecomes sibilant. The nasal cavities are filled with a purulent fluid.\r\nThe dog that coughs violently at the commencement of the disease,\r\nemploys himself, probably, on the following day, in ejecting, by a\r\nforcible expulsion from the nostrils, the purulent secretion which is\r\nsoon and plentifully developed. When he is lying quiet, and even when he\r\nseems to be asleep, there is a loud, stertorous, guttural breathing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGE.\r\n\r\nThe existence of certain insects found burrowing under the skin of the\r\nhuman being, and of various tribes of animals, has been acknowledged\r\nfrom the 12th century. In the 17th century, correct engravings of these\r\ninsects were produced. On the other hand many doubted their existence,\r\nbecause it had not been their lot to see them. In 1812, Galés, a pupil\r\nin the hospital of St. Louis, pretended to have found some of them. They\r\nwere put into the hands of M. Raspail, of Paris, who proved that they\r\nwere nothing more than the common cheese-mites; and substituted by Galés\r\nfor those seen by Bonomo.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hertwig, of Berlin, has given a graphic sketch of these\r\ninsects (Veterinarian, vol. xi. pp. 373, 489).\r\n\r\nMr. Holthouse states that, \"placed on the skin of a healthy individual,\r\nthey excite a disease in the part to which they were confined, having\r\nall the characters of scabies; that insects taken from mangy sheep,\r\nhorses, and dogs, and transplanted to healthy individuals of the same\r\nspecies, produce in them a disease analogous to that in the animals from\r\nwhich they were taken; and that there are too many well-attested cases\r\non record to permit us to doubt of scabies having been communicated from\r\nanimals to man.\"\r\n\r\nMange may in some degree be considered as an hereditary disease. A mangy\r\ndog is liable to produce mangy puppies, and the progeny of a mangy bitch\r\nwill certainly become affected sooner or later. In many cases a\r\npropensity to the disease will be speedily produced. If the puppies are\r\nnumerous, and confined in close situations, the effluvia of their\r\ntranspiration and fæcal discharges will often be productive of mange\r\nvery difficult to be removed. Close confinement, salted food, and little\r\nexercise, are frequent causes of mange.\r\n\r\n'The Scabby Mange' is a frequent form which this disease assumes. It\r\nassumes a pustular and scabby form in the red mange, particularly in\r\nwhite-haired dogs, when there is much and painful inflammation. A\r\npeculiar eruption, termed surfeit, which resembles mange, is sometimes\r\nthe consequence of exposure to cold after a hot sultry day. Large\r\nblotches appear, from which the hair falls and leaves the skin bare and\r\nrough. Acute mange sometimes takes on the character of erysipelas; at\r\nother times there is considerable inflammation. The animal exhibits heat\r\nand restlessness, and ulcerations of different kinds appear in various\r\nparts, superficial but extensive. Bleeding, aperient and cooling\r\nmedicines are indicated, and also applications of the subacetate of\r\nlead, or spermaceti ointment. A weak infusion of tobacco may be resorted\r\nto when other things fail, but it must be used with much caution. The\r\nsame may be said of all mercurial preparations. The tanner's pit has\r\nlittle efficacy, except in slight cases. Slight bleedings may be\r\nserviceable, and especially in full habits; setons may be resorted to in\r\nobstinate cases. A change in the mode of feeding will often be useful.\r\nMild purgatives, and especially Epsom salts, are often beneficial, and\r\nalso mercurial alternatives, as Æthiop's mineral with cream of tartar\r\nand nitre. The external applications require considerable caution. If\r\nmercury is used, care must be taken that the dog does not lick it. The\r\ndiarrhoea produced by mercury often has a fatal effect.\r\n\r\nUnguents are useful, but considerable care must be taken in their\r\napplication. They must be applied to the actual skin, not over the hair.\r\nIn old and bad cases much time and patience will be requisite. Mr.\r\nBlaine had a favourite setter who had virulent mange five years. He was\r\nordered to be dressed every day, or every second day, before the disease\r\nwas complete conquered.\r\n\r\nCutaneous affections have lately been prevalent to an extent altogether\r\nunprecedented on this and on the other side of the channel. In the\r\nlatter part of 1843 the disease assumed a character which had not been\r\nknown among us for many years. The common mange, which we used to think\r\nwe could easily grapple with, was now little seen: even the usual red\r\nmange with the fox-coloured stain was not of more frequent occurrence\r\nthan usual, but an intolerable itchiness with comparatively little\r\nredness of skin, and rarely sufficient to account for the torture which\r\nthe animal seemed to endure, and often with not the slightest\r\ndiscoloration of the integument, came before us almost every day, and\r\nunder its influence the dog became ill-tempered, dispirited, and\r\nemaciated, until he sunk under its influence. All unguents were thrown\r\naway here. Lotions of corrosive sublimate, decoction of bark, infusion\r\nof digitalis or tobacco, effected some little good; but the persevering\r\nuse of the iodine of potassium, purgatives, and the abstraction of blood\r\nvery generally succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe sudden appearance of redness of the skin, and exudation from it, and\r\nactual sores attending the falling off of the hair, and itching, that\r\nseemed to be intolerable, have also been prevalent to an unprecedented\r\nextent. This mange, however, is to a certain degree manageable. A dose\r\nor two of physic should he given, with an application of a calamine\r\npowder, and the administration of the iodide of potassium.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine gives a most valuable account of mange in the dog, part of\r\nwhich I shall quote somewhat at length. Mange exerts a morbid\r\nconstitutional action on the skin; it is infectious from various\r\nmiasmata, and it is contagious from personal communication. In some\r\nanimals it may be produced by momentary contact; it descends to other\r\nanimals of various descriptions; there is no doubt that it is\r\noccasionally hereditary: it is generated by effluvia of many various\r\nkinds; almost every kind of rancid or stimulating food is the parent of\r\nit. High living with little exercise is a frequent cause of it, and the\r\nnear approach of starvation is not unfavorable to it. The scabby mange\r\nis the common form under which it generally appears. In red mange the\r\nwhole integument is in a state of acute inflammation; surfeit, or\r\nblotches, a kind of cuticular eruption breaks out on particular parts of\r\nthe body without the slightest notice, and, worse than all, a direct\r\nfebrile attack, with swelling and ulceration, occurs, under which the\r\ndog evidently suffers peculiar heat and pain. Last of all comes local\r\nmange. Almost every eruptive disease, whether arising from the eye, the\r\near, the scrotum, or the feet, is injurious to the quality as well as\r\nthe health of every sporting dog: the scent invariably becomes diseased,\r\nand the general powers are impaired.\r\n\r\nThere are several accounts of persons who, having handled mangy dogs,\r\nhave been affected with an eruption very similar to the mange. A\r\ngentleman and his wife who had been in the habit of fondling a mangy pug\r\ndog, were almost covered with an eruption resembling mange. Several of\r\nmy servants in the dog-hospital have experienced a similar attack; and\r\nthe disease was once communicated to a horse by a cat that was\r\naccustomed to lie on his back as he stood in the stall.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTS.\r\n\r\nThese are often unpleasant things to have to do with. A Newfoundland dog\r\nhad the whole of the inside of his mouth lined with warts. I applied the\r\nfollowing caustic:--Hyd. suc-corrosivi [Symbol: ounce] j., acidi mur.\r\n[Symbol: ounce], alcoholis [Symbol: ounce] iiij., aquæ [Symbol: ounce]\r\nij. The warts were touched twice every day, and in less than a fortnight\r\nthey had all disappeared.\r\n\r\nAnother dog had its mouth filled with warts, and the above solution was\r\napplied. In four days considerable salivation came on, and lasted a\r\nweek, but at the expiration of that time the warts had vanished. The\r\nowner of the dog had applied the solution with the tip of her finger;\r\nshe experienced some salivation, which she attributed to this cause.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the dog, from the feebleness of its perspiratory functions,\r\nis little sensible to the influence of diaphoretics: therefore we trust\r\nso much to external applications for the cure of diseases of the skin of\r\nthat animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANCER\r\n\r\nThis is a disease too frequent among females of the dog tribe, and\r\noccasionally seen in the male. Its symptoms, local and general, are\r\nvarious. They are usually very obscure in their commencement; they\r\nincrease without any limit; they are exasperated by irritants of any\r\nkind; and in the majority of cases their reproduction is almost\r\nconstant, and perfectly incurable.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the female, it is mostly connected with the secretion of\r\nmilk. Two or three years may pass, and at almost every return of the\r\nperiod of oestrum, there will be some degree of enlargement or\r\ninflammation of the teats. Some degree of fever also appears; but, after\r\na few weeks have passed away, and one or two physic balls have been\r\nadministered, everything goes on well. In process of time, however, the\r\nperiod of oestrum is attended by a greater degree of fever and\r\nenlargement of the teats, and at length some diminutive hardened nuclei,\r\nnot exceeding in size the tip of a finger, are felt within one of the\r\nteats. By degrees they increase in size; they become hard, hot, and\r\ntender. A considerable degree of redness begins to appear. Some small\r\nenlargements are visible. The animal evidently exhibits considerable\r\npain when these enlargements are pressed upon. They rapidly increase,\r\nthey become more hot and red, various shining protuberances appear about\r\nthe projection, and at length the tumour ulcerates. A considerable\r\ndegree of sanious matter flows from the aperture.\r\n\r\nThe tumours, however, after a while diminish in size; the heat and\r\nredness diminish; the ulcer partly or entirely closes, but, after a\r\nwhile, and especially when the next period of oestrum arrives, the\r\ntumour again increases, and with far greater rapidity than before, and\r\nthen comes the necessity of the removal of the tumour, or if not, the\r\ndestruction of the animal. In the great majority of cases, the removal\r\nof the cancer does not destroy the dog, but lessens its torture. The\r\nknife and the forceps must usually be resorted to, and in the hands of a\r\nskilful surgeon the life of the animal will be saved.\r\n\r\nWhen the cancer is attached to the neighbouring parts by cellular\r\nsubstance alone, no difficulty will be experienced in detaching the\r\nwhole of it. The operation will be speedily performed, and there will be\r\nan end of the matter; but, if the tumour has been neglected, and the\r\nmuscular, the cellular, or even the superficial parts have been\r\nattacked, the utmost caution is requisite that every diseased portion\r\nshall be removed. Mr. Blaine adds to this that\r\n\r\n  \"it must also be taken into the account, that, although in the canine\r\n  cancer ulceration does not often reappear in the intermediate part,\r\n  when the operation has been judiciously performed, yet, when the\r\n  constitution has been long affected with this ulcerative action, it is\r\n  very apt to show itself in some neighbouring part soon after.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGUS HÆMATODES.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1836, a valuable pointer dog was sent to Mr. Adam\r\nof Beaufort, quite emaciated, with total loss of appetite and with a\r\nlarge fungus hæmatodes about the middle of the right side of his neck.\r\nIt had begun to appear about five months before, and was not at first\r\nlarger than a pea. Mr. Adam gave him a purgative of Barbadoes aloes,\r\nwhich caused the discharge of much fetid matter from the intestines. At\r\nthe expiration of three days he removed the tumour with the knife. There\r\nwas a full discharge of healthy matter from the wound. During the period\r\nof its healing the animal was well fed, and ferruginous tonics were\r\ngiven. In a little more than three weeks the wound had completely filled\r\nup with healthy granulations, and the dog was sent home to all\r\nappearance quite well.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of three months another tumour made its appearance\r\nnear the situation of the former one, growing fast; it had attained\r\nnearly the size of the other. Mr. Adam removed it immediately, ordering\r\na system of nutritive feeding and tonics. It appeared at first to go on\r\nfavourable; but, five days after the removal of the second one, a third\r\nmade its appearance.\r\n\r\nThis was removed at the expiration of another five days; but the animal\r\nwas totally unable to walk, with very laborious breathing and cold\r\nextremities. A cathartic was given and the legs bandaged; but the wounds\r\nmade no progress towards healing, and at the end of three days he died.\r\nOn exposing the cavity of the thorax it was almost covered with\r\nvariously formed tumours, from the size of a pigeon's egg to that of a\r\nsmall pea. The intercostal muscles had many of these adhering to them,\r\nand a few small ones were developed on the heart. There were three on\r\nthe diaphragm, in the centre of which matter was formed. The\r\nblood-vessels, kidneys, &c., were free from disease. These tumours were\r\nwhite, or nearly so, rather hard, and of a glandular substance. The\r\nexternal ones were soft, red, and almost destitute of blood-vessels,\r\nexcept the first, which bled considerably. There was dropsy of the\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE FEET\r\n\r\nSore feet constitute a frequent and troublesome complaint. It consists\r\nof inflammation of the vascular substance, between the epidermis and the\r\nparts beneath. It is the result of numerous slight contusions, produced\r\nby long travelling in dry weather, or hunting over a hard and rough\r\ncountry, or one covered with frost and snow. The irritation with which\r\nit commences continues to increase and a certain portion of fluid is\r\ndetermined to the feet, and tubercles are formed, hard, hot, and tender,\r\nuntil the whole foot is in a diseased state, considerably enlarged. The\r\nanimal sadly suffers, and is scarcely able to stand up for a minute.\r\nSometimes the ardour of the chase will make him for a while forget all\r\nthis; but on his return, and when he endeavours to repose himself, it is\r\nwith difficulty that he can be got up again. The toes become enlarged,\r\nthe skin red and tender, and the horny sole becomes detached and drops.\r\nLocal fever, and that to a considerable extent, becomes established; it\r\nreacts on the general economy of the animal, who scarcely moves from his\r\nbed, and at length refuses all food. At other times a separation takes\r\nplace between the dermis and the epidermis, which is a perfect mass of\r\nserosity.\r\n\r\nStill, however, it is only when all this has much increased, or has been\r\nneglected, that any permanently dangerous consequences take place. When\r\nviolent inflammation has set in, the feet must be carefully attended to,\r\nor the dog may be lamed for life. One or two physic-balls may be given;\r\nall salted meat should be removed, and the animal supplied with food\r\nwithout being compelled to move from his bed. The feet should be bathed\r\nwith warm water, and a poultice of linseed meal applied to them twice in\r\nthe day. If, as is too often the case, he should tear this off, the feet\r\nshould be often fomented. It is bad practice in any master of dogs to\r\nsuffer them to be at all neglected when there are any tokens of\r\ninflammation of the feet. The neglect of even a few days may render a\r\ndog a cripple for life. If there are evident appearances of pus\r\ncollecting about the claws, or any part of the feet, the abscess should\r\nbe opened, well bathed with warm water, and friar's balsam applied to\r\nthe feet.\r\n\r\nWhen the feet have been neglected, the nail is apt to grow very rapidly,\r\nand curve round and penetrate into the foot. The forceps should he\r\napplied, and the claws reduced to their proper size.\r\n\r\nIf there are any indications of fever, or if the dog should be\r\ncontinually lying down, or he should hold up his feet, and keep them\r\napart as much as he can, scarifications or poultices, or both, should be\r\nresorted to.\r\n\r\nWhen the feet of a dog become sore in travelling, the foolish habit of\r\nwashing them with brine should never be permitted, although it is very\r\ncommonly resorted to. Warm fomentations, or warm pot-liquor, or\r\npoultices of linseed meal should be applied, or, if matter is apparently\r\nforming, the lancet may be resorted to.\r\n\r\nDogs are frequently sent to the hospital with considerable redness\r\nbetween the toes, and ichorous discharge, and the toes thickened round\r\nthe base of the nails, as if they were inclined to drop off. The common\r\nalterative medicine should be given, and a lotion composed of hydrarg.\r\noxym. gr. vi., alcohol [Symbol: ounce] j., et aq. calcis [Symbol: ounce]\r\niiij., should he applied to the feet three times every day. Leathern\r\ngloves should be sewn on them. These cases are often very obstinate.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the dog has five toes on the fore feet, and four on\r\nthe hind feet, with a mere rudiment of a fifth metatarsal bone in some\r\nfeet; but, in others, the fifth bone is long and well proportioned, and\r\nadvances as far as the origin of the first phalanx of the neighbouring\r\ntoe.\r\n\r\n[The editor begs leave to add a more detailed and systematic treatise of\r\nthe affections generally attacking the feet and limbs of our dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE FEET.\r\n\r\nSORE FEET.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the feet, a disease somewhat analogous to founder in\r\nhorses, and often attended with equally bad results, particularly in the\r\nEnglish kennels, is comparatively rare with us, although there are few\r\nsportsmen but have met with some cases among their dogs. The feet become\r\ntender, swollen, and hot, violent inflammatory action sets in, the toes\r\nbecome sore, the claws diseased, and the balls very painful, and often\r\nsuppurate.\r\n\r\nThe animal is thus speedily rendered useless; not being able to support\r\nhis body, owing to the intense pain, he remains in his house, and\r\nemploys the most of his time in temporarily assuaging his sufferings by\r\nconstantly licking the diseased members.\r\n\r\n'Causes'.--Running long distances over frozen or stony grounds, hunting\r\nover a rough and ill-cleaned country, over-feeding, confinement, and\r\nlazy habits, are all conducive in some measure to this affection.\r\n\r\nThis form of disease is not uncommon among those dogs used in toling\r\nducks on the Chesapeake bay, these animals being obliged to run\r\nincessantly to and fro over the gravel shores, in their efforts to\r\nattract the canvass-back.  We have seen many dogs that have been made\r\ncripples by this arduous work, and rendered prematurely old while yet in\r\ntheir prime. It would certainly be wise and humane on the part of those\r\nwho pursue this sport either for pleasure or gain, to provide suitable\r\nboots for these sagacious animals, who in return would repay such\r\nkindness by increased ardour and length of service. These articles might\r\nbe made of leather, or some other durable substance, in such a manner\r\nthat they could be laced on every morning before commencing their\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nThe claws should be allowed to project through openings in the boot, as\r\nthis arrangement will give much more freedom to the feet, and the boot\r\nitself will not be destroyed so soon by the penetration of the toes\r\nthrough its substance. Boots thus neatly made will neither interfere\r\nwith his locomotive nor swimming powers, but add greatly to the comfort\r\nof the animal, and secure his services for many years.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--No stimulating applications to the feet are to be used,\r\nsuch as salt water, ley, fish brine, or urine, but rather emollient\r\npoultices and cooling washes. These last-mentioned remedies should be\r\ncarefully applied, and the dog confined to his house as much as\r\npossible: in fact, there is little difficulty in restraining him in this\r\nrespect, as he has but little inclination or ability to move about.\r\n\r\nPurging balls should be administered every night, and blood abstracted\r\nif there be much fever, as indicated in the heat, swelling, and pain of\r\nthe limbs.\r\n\r\nIf the balls continue to swell, and there is a collection of pus within\r\nthem, they may be opened by the lancet, and the contents evacuated,\r\nafter which apply a linseed poultice. When the inflammation has\r\nsubsided, simple dressings of melted butter or fresh lard will generally\r\neffect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUSTULAR AFFECTION OF THE FEET.\r\n\r\nDogs frequently have a pustular eruption between the toes, either\r\naccompanying mange or some other skin disease, or entirely independent\r\nof any other affection.\r\n\r\n'Causes'.--Want of cleanliness, bad housing, improper food, vermin, and\r\ndepraved constitution.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--Frequent washing with castile soap and water will correct\r\nthis disease; the feet and legs after washing should be rubbed dry,\r\nparticularly between the toes.  When the pustules are large, they may be\r\nopened with the lancet and a poultice applied. If the disease appears\r\ncomplicated with mange, or dependent upon other general causes, the\r\nprimary affection must be removed by the proper remedies, which\r\ngenerally carries off with the secondary disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAINS\r\n\r\nIt is not an uncommon occurrence for dogs, while running, climbing\r\nfences, or jumping ditches, to sprain themselves very severely in the\r\nknee, or more frequently in the shoulder-joint; and if not properly\r\nattended to, will remain cripples for life, owing to enlargement of the\r\ntendon and deposition of matter.\r\n\r\nWe once had a fine, large, powerful bull-dog, that sprained himself in\r\nthe shoulder while running very violently in the street after another\r\ndog, and in some way, owing to the great eagerness to overtake the\r\nother, tripped up when at the top of his speed, fell on his chest, and\r\nwhen he arose commenced limping, and evidently suffered from\r\nconsiderable pain. On taking him home, we examined his feet, limbs, and\r\nchest very particularly, expecting to find a luxation or fracture of\r\nsome of the bones of the leg or feet, or perhaps the presence of a piece\r\nof glass or other article deeply imbedded in the ball. None of the above\r\naccidents, however, being brought to light by our examination, or that\r\nof a medical friend who expressed a wish to see our patient, we\r\nconcluded that a simple sprain of some of the tendons had taken place.\r\n\r\nOn the following day there was slight swelling and tenderness of the\r\nshoulder-joint, accompanied by great unwillingness to put the foot to\r\nthe ground, owing to the pain that seemed to be produced by the\r\nextension of the leg. The limb was fomented, and the dog confined for\r\nseveral days, till the swelling and tenderness disappeared; but, greatly\r\nto our astonishment and that of others, he still remained lame as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThis lameness continued for several months, when we parted with him,\r\nsending him to a relative in the country, who informed us that he never\r\nrecovered the use of his limb, but that it became shrivelled and\r\ndeformed for want of use.\r\n\r\nThe cause of lameness in this dog is as unaccountable as some cases of\r\nlameness we see in horses. We are convinced that there was neither\r\nfracture nor luxation, nor any other unnatural displacement of the\r\nparts, and can attribute it to nothing but enlargement of one of the\r\ntendons of the shoulder-joint resulting from inflammation. If it had\r\nbeen in our power, we should have liked to have examined this animal\r\nafter death.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--Hot fomentations to the part affected, together with\r\npurging balls and bleeding, if there be great tenderness and swelling of\r\nthe limb. When the inflammation and tumefaction have disappeared, rub\r\nthe parts with opodeldoc, or other stimulating mixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE FEET.\r\n\r\nDogs are apt to cut their feet by stepping upon sharp tools, bits of\r\noyster-shell, old iron, &c., or by the introduction of thorns, burrs,\r\nnails, bits of glass, and other articles, into their balls.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--If the cut be very deep, or divides the ball, the foot\r\nmust be washed in tepid water, and the edges of the wound drawn together\r\nand retained in their position by a couple of sutures or a strap or two\r\nof adhesive plaster, and the animal confined.\r\n\r\nWhere thorns or sand-burrs have pierced the foot, diligent search should\r\nbe made to extract them, or the wound will suppurate, and the dog\r\ncontinue lame for a long time. This caution is particularly necessary\r\nwhen minute particles of glass have entered the foot. A poultice in such\r\ncases should be applied, after removing every particle within our reach,\r\nand the, foot be wrapped up, or, what is better, enclosed in a boot of\r\nsome kind, sufficiently strong to protect it from the dirt or other\r\nsmall particles which otherwise would enter the wound and prevent its\r\nhealing. In a case of great emergency, one of our friends hunted a\r\nsetter dog three successive days in a leather boot, which we instructed\r\na country cobbler to put on him to protect his foot from a recent and\r\ndeep cut, that he had received from treading upon some farming utensils.\r\nThe boot was taken off every night, the foot nicely cleaned, the leather\r\noiled and replaced ready for the following day. The wound afterwards\r\nhealed up, and no trace of the incision now remains. The boot should be\r\nmade of stout, flexible leather, and extend beyond the first joint; the\r\nseam must be in front, so as not to interfere with the dog's tread.\r\nThere should be openings for the claws, and the sole large enough to\r\nallow the expansion of the ball pads when in motion: a small layer of\r\ntow had better be laid on the bottom of the foot before putting on the\r\nboot.\r\n\r\nIt is often very difficult to tell the exact spot where a briar or thorn\r\nhas entered the foot, owing to its penetrating so far into the substance\r\nof the ball as to be entirely concealed under the skin, or by the\r\nswelling of the parts surrounding it. In all such cases the bottom of\r\nthe foot should he gently pressed by the thumb, and the point where the\r\ndog exhibits symptoms of must pain should be, particularly examined,\r\nand, if necessary, cut down upon to extract the extraneous substance, no\r\nmatter what it may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG NAILS OR CLAWS.\r\n\r\nThe nails of some dogs require occasional cutting, otherwise they grow\r\nso long and fast that they turn in and penetrate the ball of the foot.\r\nIf we cut them, a strong, sharp knife is necessary for the purpose;\r\nfiling them off we consider far preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMENESS\r\n\r\nDogs, as well as horses, become lame from stiff joints, splints, and\r\nsprains. Stiff joints are occasioned by anchylosis, or the deposit of\r\ncalcareous or osseous matter within the ligament or around the head of\r\nthe bone, which latter defect is known as ring-bone in the horse.\r\n\r\n'Treatment'.--Stimulating friction to the parts, such as spirits of\r\ncamphor, or camphorated liniment, mercurial ointment, tincture of\r\niodine, opodeldoc, blistering, c.--L.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nFRACTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are of not unfrequent occurrence in the dog; and I once had five\r\ncases in my hospital at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn the human subject, fractures are more frequent in adults, and,\r\nperhaps, in old men, than in infants; but this is not the case with the\r\nsmaller animals generally, and particularly with dogs. Five-sixths of\r\nthe fractures occur between the time of weaning and the animal being six\r\nmonths old; not, perhaps, because of their chemical composition, that\r\nthe bones are more fragile at this age; but because young dogs are more\r\nexposed to fall from the hands of the persons who carry them, and from\r\nthe places to which they climb; and the extremities of the bones, then\r\nbeing in the state of epiphysis, are easily separated from the body of\r\nthe bone. When the fracture takes place in the body of the bone, it is\r\ntransverse or somewhat oblique, but there is scarcely any displacement.\r\n\r\nA simple bandage will be sufficient for the reduction of these\r\nfractures, which may be removed in ten or twelve days, when the\r\npreparatory callus has acquired some consistence. One only out of twenty\r\ndogs that were brought to me with fractures of the extremities, in the\r\nyear 1834, died. Two dogs had their jaws fractured by kicks from horses,\r\nand lost several of their teeth. In one of them the anterior part of the\r\njaw was fractured perpendicularly; in the other, both branches were\r\nfractured. Plenty of good soup was injected into their mouths. Ten or\r\ntwelve days afterwards, they were suffered to lap it; and in a little\r\nwhile they were dismissed cured.\r\n\r\nIt will be desirable, perhaps, to describe our usual method of reducing\r\nthe greater part of the fractures which come under our notice.\r\n\r\nI.--The 'humerus' was fractured just above the elbow and close to the\r\njoint. The limb was enclosed in adhesive plaster, and supported by a\r\nfirm bandage. The bones were beginning to unite, when, by some means\r\nconcerning which I could never satisfy myself, the 'tibia' was broken a\r\nlittle above the hock. Nothing could well be done with this second\r\nfracture; but great care was taken with regard to the former. The lower\r\nhead of the humerus remained somewhat enlarged; but the lameness became\r\nvery slight, and in three weeks had nearly or quite disappeared. Nothing\r\nwas done to the second fracture; in fact, nothing more than a slight,\r\nannular enlargement, surrounding the part, remained--a proof of the\r\nrenovating power of nature.\r\n\r\nII.--A spaniel was run over by a light carriage. It was unable to put\r\nthe left hind leg to the ground, and at the upper tuberosity of the\r\nileum some crepitus could be distinguished. I subtracted six ounces of\r\nblood, administered a physic-ball, and ordered the patient to be well\r\nfomented with warm water several times during the night. On the\r\nfollowing day no wound could be discovered, but there was great\r\ntenderness. I continued the fomentation. Two or three days afterwards\r\nshe was evidently easier. I then had the hair cut close, and covered the\r\nloins and back with a pitch-plaster. At the expiration of six days the\r\nplaster was getting somewhat loose, and was replaced by another with\r\nwhich a very small quantity of powdered cantharides was mingled. At the\r\nexpiration of the fifth week she was quite well.\r\n\r\nIII.--The 'thigh-bone' had been broken a fortnight. It was a compound\r\nfracture: the divided edges of the bone protruded through the\r\ninteguments, and there was no disposition to unite. It is not in one\r\ncase in a hundred that an animal thus situated can be saved. We failed\r\nin our efforts, and the dog was ultimately destroyed.\r\n\r\nIV.--The 'femur' was broken near the hip. I saw it on the third day,\r\nwhen much heat and swelling had taken place. I ordered the parts to be\r\nfrequently bathed with warm water. The heat and tenderness to a\r\nconsiderable degree subsided, and the pitch-plaster was carefully\r\napplied. At the expiration of a week the plaster began to be loosened. A\r\nsecond one was applied, and when a fortnight longer had passed, a slight\r\ndegree of tenderness alone remained.\r\n\r\nV.--The following account is characteristic of the bull terrier. The\r\n'radius' had been broken, and was set, and the bones were decidedly\r\nunited, when the dog, in a moment of frantic rage, seized his own leg\r\nand crushed some of the bones. They were once more united, but his wrist\r\nbent under him in the form of a concave semicircle, as if some of the\r\nligaments of the joint had been ruptured in the moment of rage. It was\r\nevident on the following day that it was impossible to control him, and\r\nhe was destroyed.\r\n\r\nVI.--A spaniel, three months old, became fractured half-way between the\r\nwrist and the 'elbow'. A surgeon bound it up, and it became swollen to\r\nan enormous size, from the adhesive plaster that had been applied and\r\nthe manner of placing the splints. I removed the splints. On the\r\nfollowing morning I had the arm frequently fomented: a very indistinct\r\ncrepitus could be perceived at the point of the humerus: I applied\r\nanother plaster higher up, and including the elbow. The hair not having\r\nbeen cut sufficiently close, the plaster was removed, applied much more\r\nneatly and closely, and the original fracture was firmly bound together.\r\nNo crepitus was now to be perceived.\r\n\r\nI saw no more of our patient for four days, when I found that he had\r\nfallen, and that the elbow on the other side was fractured within the\r\ncapsular ligament. A very distinct crepitus could be felt, and the dog\r\ncried sadly when the joint was moved. I would have destroyed him, but he\r\nwas a favourite with his master, and we tried what a few days more would\r\nproduce. I enclosed the whole of the limb in a plaster of pitch, and\r\nbound it up without splints. Both the bandages remained on nearly a\r\nfortnight, when the fractures were found to be perfectly united, and the\r\nlameness in both legs gradually disappeared.\r\n\r\nVII.--July 22, 1843. A spaniel was frightened with something on the bed,\r\nand fell from it, and cried very much. The instep, or wrist, of the\r\nright leg, before was evidently bowed, and there was considerable heat\r\nand tenderness. It was well fomented on the two following days, and then\r\nset, and adhesive plaster was tightly applied, and a splint bound over\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n24th. The foot began to swell, and was evidently painful. The outer\r\nbandage was loosened a little, but the inner bandage was not touched.\r\n\r\nAug. 4. The bandage, that had not been meddled with for eleven days, now\r\nappeared to give him some pain. For the last two days he has been gently\r\nlicking and gnawing it. The splints were removed; but the adhesive\r\nplaster appearing even and firm, was suffered to remain.\r\n\r\n26th. Everything appeared to be going on well, when he again leaped from\r\nhis bed. The wrist was much more bowed, and was tender and hot. Simple\r\nlint and a firm calico bandage were had recourse to.\r\n\r\n27th. He is unable to put his foot to the ground, and the joint is\r\ncertainly enlarging. An adhesive plaster, made by a Frenchman, was\r\napplied at the owners request, over which was placed a splint. The dog\r\nsoon began to gnaw the plaster, which formed a sticky but not very\r\nadhesive mass. Before night the pain appeared to be very great, and the\r\ndog cried excessively. I was sent for. We well fomented the leg, and\r\nthen returned to our former treatment. There was evidently a great deal\r\nof pain, but it gradually passed over, and a slight degree of lameness\r\nalone remained.\r\n\r\nI have great pleasure in adding the following accounts of the successful\r\ntreatment of fractures in dogs by Mr. Percivall:\r\n\r\n  \"Hopeless as cases of fracture in horses generally are, from the\r\n  difficulty experienced in managing the patient, they are by no means\r\n  to be so regarded in dogs. I have in several instances seen dogs\r\n  recover, and with very good use of the parts, if not perfect\r\n  restoration of them, when the accidents have been considered, at the\r\n  time they took place, of a nature so irremediable as to render it\r\n  advisable to destroy the animals.\r\n\r\n  \"May 4, 1839. A valuable Irish spaniel fell from a high wall, and\r\n  fractured his 'off shoulder'. On examination, I found the 'os humeri'\r\n  fractured about an inch above its radial extremity, causing the limb\r\n  to drop pendulously from the side, and depriving the animal of all use\r\n  of it. The arm, by which I mean the fore arm, was movable in any\r\n  direction upon the shoulder, and there was distinct crepitus: in a\r\n  word, the nature of the accident was too plain to admit of doubt; nor\r\n  was there any splinter or loose piece of bone discoverable. I directed\r\n  that the animal might be laid flat upon his sound side in a hamper, or\r\n  covered basket or box, of sufficient dimensions, but not large enough\r\n  to admit of his moving about; to have his hind legs fettered, his\r\n  mouth muzzled, and his injured parts covered with a linen cloth wetted\r\n  with a spirit lotion.\r\n\r\n  'May' 5. The parts are tumefied, but not more, nor even so much as one\r\n  night have expected. Continue the lotion.\r\n\r\n  '6th'. At my request, Mr. Youatt was called in to give his opinion as\r\n  to the probability of effecting a cure. He thought from the\r\n  inconvenient situation of the fracture, that the chances of success\r\n  were doubtful; and recommended that a plaster, composed of thick\r\n  sheep-skin and pitch, cut to the shape of the parts, should be\r\n  applied, extending from the upper part of the shoulder down upon the\r\n  arm, and reaching to the knee; and that the whole should be enveloped\r\n  in well-applied bandages, one of them being carried over the shoulders\r\n  and brought round between the fore legs, to support the limb, and aid\r\n  in retaining the fractured ends in apposition. Prior to the\r\n  application of the pitch plaster the hair was closely shorn off. Thus\r\n  bound up, the dog was replaced in his hamper, and had some aperient\r\n  medicine given to him.\r\n\r\n  '8th'. The medicine has operated; and he appears going on well, his\r\n  appetite continuing unimpaired.\r\n\r\n  '10th'. He growls when I open the basket to look at him. On examining\r\n  him (while his keeper had hold of him), I found the plaster loosening\r\n  from its adhesion; I took it off altogether, and applied a fresh one,\r\n  composed of the stopping composition I use for horses' feet.\r\n\r\n  June 7. Up to this time everything appears to have been going on\r\n  properly. The fracture feels as if it were completely united, and, as\r\n  the plaster continues to adhere firmly, I thought the bandages\r\n  enveloping it, as they were often getting loose, might now he\r\n  dispensed with, and that the dog might with benefit be chained to a\r\n  kennel, instead of being so closely confined as he has been. In\r\n  moving, he does not attempt to use the fractured limb, but hops along\r\n  upon the three other legs.\r\n\r\n  July. He has acquired pretty good use of the limb. Being now at\r\n  liberty, he runs about a good deal; halting, from there being some\r\n  shortness of the limb, but not so much as to prevent him being\r\n  serviceable, as a 'slow' hunter, in the sporting-field.\r\n\r\n  \"About a twelvemonth ago,\" continues Mr. Percivall, \"I was consulted\r\n  concerning a blood-hound of great size and beauty, and of the cost of\r\n  £50, that had been a cripple in one of his hind limbs for some\r\n  considerable time past, owing, it was said or thought, to having\r\n  received some injury. After a very careful handling, and examination\r\n  of the parts about the hips, the places where he expressed pain, I\r\n  came to the conclusion that there had been, and still existed, some\r\n  fracture of 'the ischial portion of the pelvis', but precisely where,\r\n  or of what nature, I could not determine; and all the treatment I\r\n  could recommend was, that the animal should be shut up within a basket\r\n  or box of some, sort, of dimensions only sufficient to enable him to\r\n  lie at ease, and that he be kept there for at least six months,\r\n  without being taken out, save for the purpose of having his bed\r\n  cleansed or renewed. His owner had previously made up his mind to have\r\n  him destroyed; understanding, however, from me, that there still\r\n  remained a chance of his recovery, he ordered his groom to procure a\r\n  proper basket, and see that the dog's confinement was such as I had\r\n  prescribed. The man asked me to allow him to have his kennel, which,\r\n  being no larger than was requisite for him, I did not object to; and\r\n  to this he had an iron lattice-door made, converting it into a sort of\r\n  wild beast cage. After two months' confinement, I had him let out for\r\n  a short run, and perceived evident amendment. I believe altogether\r\n  that he was imprisoned five months, and then was found so much\r\n  improved that I had him chained to his kennel for the remaining month,\r\n  and this, I believe, was continued for another month. The issue was\r\n  the complete recovery of the animal, very much to the gratification\r\n  and joy of his master, by whom he is regarded as a kind of unique or\r\n  unobtainable production.\r\n\r\n  \"The fractures of dogs and other animals must, of course, be treated\r\n  in accordance with all the circumstances of their cases; but I have\r\n  always considered it a most essential part of their treatment that\r\n  such portable patients as dogs and cats, &c., should be placed and\r\n  kept in a state of confinement, where they either could not, or were\r\n  not likely to, use or move the fractured parts; and, moreover, I have\r\n  thought that failure, where it has resulted after such treatment, has\r\n  arisen from its not having been sufficiently long persisted in.\"\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of Professor Simonds, when there is fracture of the bones\r\nof the extremities, a starch bandage is the best that can be employed.\r\nIf applied wet, it adapts itself to the irregularities of the limbs; and\r\nif allowed to remain on twelve hours undisturbed, it forms a complete\r\ncase for the part, and affords more equal support than anything else\r\nthat can possibly be used.\r\n\r\nThe following case was one of considerable interest. It came under the\r\ncare of Professor Simonds. Two gentlemen were playing at quoits, and the\r\ndog of one of them was struck on the head by a quoit, and supposed to be\r\nkilled. His owner took him up, and found that he was not dead, although\r\ndreadfully injured. It being near the Thames, his owner took him to the\r\nedge of the river, and dashed some water over him, and he rallied a\r\nlittle. Professor Simonds detected a fracture of the skull, with\r\npressure on the brain, arising from a portion of depressed bone. The dog\r\nwas perfectly unconscious, frequently moaning, quite incapable of\r\nstanding, and continually turning round upon his belly, his straw, or\r\nhis bed. It was a case of coma; he took no food, and the pulsation at\r\nthe heart was very indistinct.\r\n\r\n  \"I told the proprietor that there was no chance of recovery except by\r\n  an operation; and, even then, I thought it exceedingly doubtful. I was\r\n  desired to operate, and I took him home.\r\n\r\n  \"The head was now almost twice as large as when the accident occurred,\r\n  proceeding from a quantity of coagulated blood that had been effused\r\n  under the skin covering the skull. I gave him a dose of aperient\r\n  medicine, and on the following morning commenced my operation.\r\n\r\n  \"The hair was clipped from the head, and an incision carried\r\n  immediately from between the eye-brows to the back part of the skull,\r\n  in the direction of the sagittal suture. Another incision was made\r\n  from this towards the root of the ear. This triangular flap was then\r\n  turned back, in order to remove the coagulated blood and make a\r\n  thorough exposure of the skull. I was provided with a trephine,\r\n  thinking that only a portion of the bone had been depressed on the\r\n  brain, and it would be necessary, with that instrument, to separate it\r\n  from its attachment, and then with an elevator remove it; but I found\r\n  that the greater part of the parietal bone was depressed, and that the\r\n  fracture extended along the sagittal suture from the coronal and\r\n  lamdoidal sutures. At three-fourths of the width of the bone, the\r\n  fracture ran parallel with the sagittal suture, and this large portion\r\n  was depressed upon the tunics of the brain, the dura mater being\r\n  considerably lacerated. The depressed bone was raised with an\r\n  elevator, and I found, from its lacerated edges and the extent of the\r\n  mischief done, that it was far wiser to remove it entirely, than to\r\n  allow it to remain and take the chance of its uniting.\r\n\r\n  \"In a few days, the dog began to experience relief from the operation,\r\n  and to be somewhat conscious of what was taking place around him.  He\r\n  still requires care and attention, and proper medicinal agents to be\r\n  administered from time to time; but with the exception of occasionally\r\n  turning round when on the floor, he takes his food well, and obeys his\r\n  master's call.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Trans. Vet. Med. Assoc., i. 51.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMEDICINES USED IN THE TREATMENT OF THE DISEASES OF THE DOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are far more numerous and complicated than would, on the first\r\nconsideration of them, be imagined. The Veterinary Surgeon has a long\r\nlist of them, suited to the wants and dangers, imaginary or real, of his\r\npatients; and he who is not scientifically acquainted with them, will\r\noccasionally blunder in the choice of remedies, or the application of\r\nthe means of cure which he adopts. Little attention may, perhaps, be\r\npaid to the medical treatment of the dog; yet it requires not a little\r\nstudy and experience. I will endeavour to give a short account of the\r\ndrugs, and mode of using them, generally employed.\r\n\r\nThe administering of medicines to dogs is, generally speaking, simple\r\nand safe, if a little care is taken about the matter, and especially if\r\ntwo persons are employed in the operation. The one should be sitting\r\nwith the dog between his knees, and the hinder part of the animal\r\nresting on the floor. The mouth is forced open by the pressure of the\r\nfore-finger and thumb upon the lips of the upper jaw, and the medicine\r\ncan be conveniently introduced with the other hand, and passed\r\nsufficiently far into the throat to insure its not being returned. The\r\nmouth should be closed and kept so, until the bolus has been seen to\r\npass down. Mr. Blaine thus describes the difference between the\r\nadministration of liquid and solid medicines:\r\n\r\n  \"A little attention will prevent all danger. A ball or bolus should be\r\n  passed completely over the root of the tongue, and pushed some way\r\n  backward and forward. When a liquid is given, if the quantity is more\r\n  than can be swallowed at one effort, it should be removed from the\r\n  mouth at each deglutition, or the dog may be strangled. Balls of a\r\n  soft consistence, and those composed of nauseous ingredients, should\r\n  be wrapped in thin paper, or they may disgust the dog and produce\r\n  sickness.\"\r\n\r\nDogs labouring under disease should be carefully nursed: more depends on\r\nthis than many persons seem to be aware. A warm and comfortable bed is\r\nof a great deal more consequence than many persons who are fond of their\r\ndogs imagine. Cleanliness is also an essential point. Harshness of\r\nmanner and unkind treatment will evidently aggravate many of their\r\ncomplaints. I have sometimes witnessed an angry word spoken to a healthy\r\ndog produce instant convulsions in a distempered one that happened to be\r\nnear; and the fits that come on spontaneously in distemper, almost\r\ninstantly leave the dog by soothing notice of him.\r\n\r\n'Acidum Acetum (Vinegar)'.--This is useful for sprains, bruises, and\r\nfomentations.\r\n\r\n'Acidum Nitricum (Nitric Acid; Aqua Fortis)'.--This may be used with\r\nadvantage to destroy warts or fungous excrescences. A little of the acid\r\nshould be dropped on the part and bound tightly down. The protuberance\r\nwill slough off and healthy granulations will spring up. A surer\r\napplication, however, is the nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\n'Acidum Hydrocyanicum (Prussic Acid)'.--This is an excellent application\r\nfor the purpose of allaying irritation of the skin in dogs; but it must\r\nbe very carefully watched. I have seen a drachm of it diluted with a\r\npint of distilled water, rapidly allay cuticular inflammation. The\r\ndreadful degree of itching which had been observed during the last two\r\nor three years yielded to this application alone; and to that it has\r\nalmost invariably yielded, a little patience being used.\r\n\r\n'Acupuncturation' is a practice lately introduced into veterinary\r\nsurgery. It denotes the insertion of a needle into the skin or flesh of\r\na person or animal suffering severely from some neuralgic affection. The\r\nneedle is small and sharp: it is introduced by a slight pressure and\r\nsemi-rotating motion between the thumb and forefinger, and afterwards\r\nwithdrawn with the same motion. This should always employ a quarter of\r\nan hour at least, and in cases of very great pain it should continue two\r\nhours; but when the object is to afford an exit to the fluid collected,\r\nmere puncture is sufficient. It is attended with very little pain; and\r\ntherefore it may be employed at least with safety if not with advantage.\r\nThe operation was known and practised in Japan, many years ago; but it\r\nwas only in the seventeenth century that its singular value was\r\nascertained. In 1810 some trials of it were made in Paris, and M. Chenel\r\nlook the lead. He had a young dog that he had cured of distemper, except\r\nthat a spasmodic affection of the left hind leg remained. He applied a\r\nneedle, and with fair success. He failed with another dog; but M.\r\nPrevost, of Geneva, relieved two mares from rheumatism, and an entire\r\nhorse that had been lame sixteen months. In the Veterinary School at\r\nLyons acupuncturation was tried on two dogs. One had chorea, and the\r\nother chronic paralysis of the muscles of the neck. The operation had no\r\neffect on the first; the other came out of the hospital completely\r\ncured. In the following year acupuncturation was tried without success\r\nin the same school. Four horses and two dogs were operated upon in vain.\r\n\r\n'Adeps (Hog's Lard)' forms the basis of all our ointments. It is\r\ntasteless, inodorous and free from every stimulating quality.\r\n\r\n'Alcohol (Rectified Spirit)'.--This is principally used in tinctures,\r\nand seldom or never administered to the dog in a pure state.\r\n\r\n'Aloes, Barbadoes'.--From these are formed the safest and best aperients\r\nfor the dog--consisting of powdered aloes, eight parts; antimonial\r\npowder, one part; ginger, one part; and palm oil, five parts; beaten\r\nwell together, and the size of the ball varying from half a drachm to\r\ntwo drachms, and a ball administered every fourth or fifth hour. Mr.\r\nBlaine considers it to be the safest general purgative. He says that\r\nsuch is the peculiarity of the bowels of the dog, that while a man can\r\ntake with impunity as much calomel as would kill two large dogs, a\r\nmoderate-sized dog will take a quantity of aloes sufficient to destroy\r\ntwo stout men. The smallest dog can take 15 or 20 grains; half a drachm\r\nis seldom too much; but the smaller dose had better be tried first, for\r\nhundreds of dogs are every year destroyed by temerity in this\r\nparticular. Medium-sized dogs usually require a drachm; and some large\r\ndogs have taken two or even three drachms.\r\n\r\n'Alteratives' are medicines that effect some slow change in the diseased\r\naction of certain parts, without interfering with the food or work. The\r\nmost useful consist of five parts of sublimed sulphur, one of nitre, one\r\nof linseed meal, and two of lard or palm oil.\r\n\r\n'Alum' is a powerful astringent, whether employed externally or\r\ninternally. It is occasionally administered in doses of from 10 to 15\r\ngrains in obstinate diarrhoea. In some obstinate cases, alum whey has\r\nbeen employed in the form of a clyster.\r\n\r\n'Oxide of Antimony', in the form of a compound powder, and under the\r\nname of James's powder, is employed as a sudorific, or to cause a\r\ndetermination to the skin.\r\n\r\nThe 'Antimonii Potassio Tartras (Tartar Emetic)', besides its effect on\r\nthe skin, is a useful nauseant, and invaluable in inflammation of the\r\nlungs and catarrhal affections of every kind. The 'Black Sesquisulphuret\r\nof Antimony' is a compound of sulphur and antimony, and an excellent\r\nalterative.\r\n\r\n'Argenti Nitras--Nitrate of Silver (Lunar Caustic)'.--I have already\r\nstrongly advocated the employment of this caustic for empoisoned wounds\r\nand bites of rabid animals. In my opinion it supersedes the use of every\r\nother caustic, and generally of the knife. I have also given it\r\ninternally as a tonic to the dog, in cases of chorea, in doses from an\r\neighth to a quarter of a grain. A dilute solution may be employed as an\r\nexcitant to wounds, in which the healing process has become sluggish.\r\nFor this purpose, ten grains or more may be dissolved in a fluid ounce\r\nof distilled water. A few fibres of tow dipped in this solution, being\r\ndrawn through the channel which is left on the removal of a seton,\r\nquickly excite the healing action. Occasionally one or two drops of this\r\nsolution may be introduced into the eye for the purpose of removing\r\nopalescence of the cornea. In cases of fungoid matter being thrown out\r\non the cornea, the fungus may be touched with a rod of nitrate of\r\nsilver, and little pain will follow.\r\n\r\nThe 'Peruvian Bark', or its active principle the disulphate of quina, is\r\na valuable tonic in distemper, especially when combined with the iodide\r\nof iron; the iron increasing with the general tone of the system, and\r\nthe iodine acting as a stimulant to the absorbents.\r\n\r\n'Blisters' are occasionally useful or indispensable in some of the\r\ncasualties and diseases to which the dog is liable. They are mostly of\r\nthe same description, and act upon the same principles as in the horse,\r\nwhether in the form of plaster, or ointment, or stimulating fluid.\r\nBlisters can be kept on the dog with difficulty: nothing short of a wire\r\nmuzzle will suffice; Mr. Blaine says, that for very large dogs, he used\r\nto be compelled to make use of a perforated tin one. The judgment of the\r\npractitioner will determine in these cases, as well as with regard to\r\nthe horse, whether the desired effect should be produced by severe\r\nmeasures or by those of a milder character, by active blisters or by\r\nmilder stimulants; the difficulty of the measures to be adopted, and the\r\ndegree of punishment that may be inflicted, being never forgotten by the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\nWe have stated in our work on the Horse, that \"the art of blistering\r\nconsists in cutting or rather shaving the hair perfectly close; then\r\nwell rubbing in the ointment, and afterwards, and, what is the greatest\r\nconsequence of all, plastering a little more of the ointment lightly\r\nover the part, and leaving it. As soon as the vesicles have perfectly\r\nrisen, which will be in twenty or twenty-four hours, the torture of the\r\nanimal may be somewhat relieved by the application of olive or\r\nneat's-foot oil, or any emollient ointment.\r\n\r\n\"An infusion of two ounces of the cantharides in a pint of oil of\r\nturpentine, for several days, is occasionally used as a languid blister;\r\nand when sufficiently lowered with common oil, it is called a 'sweating'\r\noil, for it maintains a certain degree of irritation and inflammation on\r\nthe skin, yet not sufficient to blister; and thus gradually abates or\r\nremoves some old or deep inflammation, or cause of lameness.\" [1]\r\n\r\nIodine in various cases is now rapidly superseding the cantharides and\r\nthe turpentine.\r\n\r\n'Calomel'--Sufficient has been said of this dangerous medicine in the\r\ncourse of the present work. I should rarely think of exhibiting it,\r\nexcept in small doses for the purpose of producing that specific\r\ninfluence on the liver, which we know to be the peculiar property of\r\nthis drug. In large doses it will to a certain extent produce vomiting;\r\nand, if it finds its way into the intestines, it acts as a powerful\r\ndrastic purgative.\r\n\r\n'Castor Oil (Oleum Ricini)'.--This is a most valuable medicine. It is\r\nusually combined with the syrup of buckthorn and white poppies, in the\r\nproportions of three parts of the oil to two of the buckthorn and one of\r\nthe poppy-syrup; which form a combination of ingredients in which the\r\noleaginous, stimulant, and narcotic ingredients happily blend.\r\n\r\n'Catechu.'--This is an extract from the wood of an acacia-tree '(Acacia\r\ncatechu)', and possesses a powerful astringent property. It is given in\r\ncases of superpurgation, united with opium, chalk, and powdered gum. A\r\ntincture of it is very useful for the purpose of hastening the healing\r\nprinciple of wounds. Professor Morton says, that he considers it as the\r\nmost valuable of the vegetable astringents.\r\n\r\n'Clysters.'--Professor Morton gives an account of the use of clysters.\r\nThe objects, he says, for which they are administered, are--1. To empty\r\nthe bowels of fæces: thus they act as an aperient. Also, to induce a\r\ncathartic to commence its operations, when, from want of exercise or due\r\npreparation, it is tardy in producing the desired effect. Clysters\r\noperate in a twofold way: first, by softening the contents of the\r\nintestines; and, secondly, by exciting an irritation in one portion of\r\nthe canal which is communicated throughout the whole; hence they become\r\nvaluable when the nature and progress of the disease require a quick\r\nevacuation of the bowels. The usual enema is warm water, but this may be\r\nrendered more stimulating by the addition of salt, oil, or aloes. 2. For\r\nthe purpose of killing worms that are found in the rectum and large\r\nintestines: in this case it is usually of an oleaginous nature. 3. For\r\nrestraining diarrhoea: sedatives and astringents being then employed. 4.\r\nFor nourishing the body when food cannot be received by the mouth. Gruel\r\nis generally the aliment thus given.  5. For allaying spasms in the\r\nstomach and bowels.\r\n\r\n'Copper'--Both the verdigris, or subacetate, and the blue vitriol of\r\nsulphate of copper, are now comparatively rarely used. They are employed\r\neither in the form of a fine powder, or mixed with an equal quantity of\r\nthe acetate of lead in order to destroy proud flesh or stimulate old\r\nulcers. They also form a part of the ægyptiacum of the farrier. There\r\nare many better drugs to accomplish the same purpose.\r\n\r\n'Creosote' is seldom used for the dog. We have applications quite as\r\ngood and less dangerous. It may be employed as a very gentle excitant\r\nand antiseptic.\r\n\r\n'Creta Preparata (Chalk)', in combination with ginger, catechu, and\r\nopium, is exceedingly useful; indeed, it is our most valuable medicine\r\nin all cases of purging, and particularly the purging of distemper.\r\n\r\n'Digitalis' is an exceedingly valuable drug. It is a direct and powerful\r\nsedative, a mild diuretic, and useful in every inflammatory and febrile\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n'Gentian' and 'Ginger' are both valuable; the first as a stomachic and\r\ntonic, and the last as a cordial and tonic. It is occasionally\r\nnecessary, or at least desirable, to draw this distinction between them.\r\n\r\n'Chloride of Lime' is a useful application for ill-conditioned wounds\r\nand for the frequent cleansing of the kennel.\r\n\r\n'Epsom Salts', or 'Sulphate of Magnesia', are mild yet effective in\r\ntheir action: with regard to cattle and sheep, they supersede every\r\nother aperient; for the dog, however, they must yield to the castor-oil\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n'Mercury'--The common mercurial ointment is now comparatively little\r\nused. It has given way to the different preparations of iodine. In\r\ndirect and virulent mange, it is yet, however, employed under the form\r\nof calomel, and combined with aloes, but in very small doses, never\r\nexceeding three grains. It is also useful in farcy and jaundice. The\r\ncorrosive sublimate is occasionally used for mange in the dog, and to\r\ndestroy vermin; but it is a very uncertain and dangerous medicine.\r\n\r\n'Palm Oil' would be an excellent emollient, if it were not so frequently\r\nadulterated with turmeric root in powder. It is far milder than the\r\ncommon lard.\r\n\r\n'Nitrate of Potash' is a valuable cooling and mild diuretic, in doses of\r\neight or ten grains.\r\n\r\n'Sulphur' is the basis of the most effectual applications for mange. It\r\nis a good alterative, combined usually with antimonials and nitre, and\r\nparticularly useful in mange, surfeit, grease, hide-bound, and want of\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n'Turpentine' is an excellent diuretic and antispasmodic; it is also a\r\nmost effectual sweating blister and highly useful in strains.\r\n\r\n'The Sulphate of Zinc' is valuable as an excitant to wounds, and\r\npromotes adhesion between divided surfaces and the 'radix'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Horse, p. 501.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW LAWS OF COURSING,\r\n\r\n'As Revised and Enlarged at a Meeting of Noblemen and Gentlemen, held at\r\nthe Thatched House Tavern, St. James's Street, June 1, 1839'.\r\n\r\nI. Two stewards shall be appointed by the members at dinner each day, to\r\nact in the field the following day, and to preside at dinner. They shall\r\nregulate the plan of beating the ground, under the sanction of the owner\r\nor occupier of the soil.\r\n\r\nII. Three or five members, including the secretary for the time being,\r\nshall form a Committee of Management, and shall name a person, for the\r\napprobation of the members, to judge all courses--all doubtful cases\r\nshall be referred to them.\r\n\r\nIII. All courses shall be from slips, by a brace of greyhounds only.\r\n\r\nIV. The time of putting the first brace of dogs in the slips shall be\r\ndeclared at dinner on the day preceding.  If a prize is to be run for,\r\nand only one dog is ready, he shall run a by, and his owner shall\r\nreceive forfeit: should neither be ready, the course shall be run when\r\nthe Committee shall think fit. In a match, if only one dog be ready, his\r\nowner shall receive forfeit; if neither be present, the match shall be\r\nplaced the last in the list.\r\n\r\nV. If any person shall enter a greyhound by a name different from that\r\nin which he last appeared in public, without giving notice of such\r\nalteration, he shall be disqualified from winning, and shall forfeit his\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\nVI. No greyhounds shall be entered as puppies unless born on or after\r\nthe 1st of January of the year preceding the day of running.\r\n\r\nVII. Any member, or other person, running a greyhound at the meeting,\r\nhaving a dog at large which shall join in the course then running, shall\r\nforfeit one sovereign; and, if belonging to either of the parties\r\nrunning, the course shall be decided against him.\r\n\r\nVIII. The judge ought to be in a position where he can see the dogs\r\nleave the slips, and to decide by the colour of the dogs to a person\r\nappointed for that purpose: his decision shall be final.\r\n\r\nIX. If, in running for prizes, the judge shall be of opinion that the\r\ncourse has not been of sufficient length to enable him to decide as to\r\nthe merits of the dogs, he shall inquire of the Committee whether he is\r\nto decide the course or not; if in the negative, the dogs shall be\r\nimmediately put again into the slips.\r\n\r\nX. The judge shall not answer any questions put to him regarding a\r\ncourse, unless such questions are asked by the Committee.\r\n\r\nXI. If any member make any observation in the hearing of the judge\r\nrespecting a course, during the time of running, or before he shall have\r\ndelivered his judgment, he shall forfeit one sovereign to the fund; and,\r\nif either dog be his own, he shall lose the course. If he impugn the\r\ndecision of the judge, he shall forfeit two sovereigns.\r\n\r\nXII. When a course of an average length is so equally divided that the\r\njudge shall be unable to decide it, the owners of the dogs may toss for\r\nit; but, if either refuse, the dogs shall be again put in the slips, at\r\nsuch time as the Committee may think fit; but, if either dog be drawn,\r\nthe winning dog shall not be obliged to run again.\r\n\r\nXIII. In running a match the judge may declare the course to be\r\nundecided.\r\n\r\nXIV. If a member shall enter more than one greyhound, 'bonâ fide' his\r\nown property, for a prize, his dogs shall not run together, if it be\r\npossible to avoid it; and, if two greyhounds, the property of the same\r\nmember, remain to the last tie, he may run it out or draw either, as he\r\nshall think fit.\r\n\r\nXV. When dogs engaged are of the same colour, the last drawn shall wear\r\na collar.\r\n\r\nXVI. If a greyhound stand still in a course when a hare is in his or her\r\nsight, the owner shall lose the course; but, if a greyhound drops from\r\nexhaustion, and it shall be the opinion of the judge that the merit up\r\nto the time of falling was greatly in his or her favour, then the judge\r\nshall have power to award the course to the greyhound so falling, if he\r\nthink fit.\r\n\r\nXVII. Should two hares be on foot, and the dogs separate before reaching\r\nthe hare slipped at, the course shall be undecided, and shall be run\r\nover again at such time as the Committee shall think fit, unless the\r\nowners of the dogs agree to toss for it, or to draw one dog; and if the\r\ndogs separate after running some time, it shall be at the discretion of\r\nthe Committee whether the course shall be decided up to the point of\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nXVIII. A course shall end if either dog be so unsighted as to cause an\r\nimpediment in the course.\r\n\r\nXIX. If any member or his servant ride over his opponent's dog when\r\nrunning, so as to injure him in the course, the dog so ridden over shall\r\nbe deemed to win the course.\r\n\r\nXX. It is recommended to all union meetings to appoint a committee of\r\nfive, consisting of members of different clubs, to determine all\r\ndifficulties and cases of doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n'The following general rules are recommended to judges for their\r\nguidance:'\r\n\r\nThe features of merit are:\r\n\r\nThe race from slips, and the first turn or wrench of the hare (provided\r\nit be a fair slip), and a straight run-up.\r\n\r\nWhere one dog gives the other a go-by when both are in their full speed,\r\nand turns or wrenches the hare. (N. B. If one dog be in the stretch, and\r\nthe other only turning at the time he passes, it is not a fair go-by.)\r\n\r\nWhere one dog turns the hare when she is leading homewards, and keeps\r\nthe lead so as to serve himself, and makes a second turn of the hare\r\nwithout losing the lead.\r\n\r\nA catch or kill of the hare, when she is running straight and leading\r\nhomewards, is fully equal to a turn of the hare when running in the same\r\ndirection, or perhaps more, if he show the speed over the other dog in\r\ndoing it. If a dog draws the fleck from the hare, and causes her to\r\nwrench or rick only, it is equal to a turn of the hare when leading\r\nhomewards.\r\n\r\nWhen a dog wrenches or ricks a hare twice following, without losing the\r\nlead, it is equal to a turn.\r\n\r\nN. B. It often happens when a hare has been turned, and she is running\r\nfrom home, that she turns of her own accord to gain ground homeward,\r\nwhen both dogs are on the stretch after her; in such a case the judge\r\nshould not give the leading dog a turn.\r\n\r\nThere are often other minor advantages in a course, such as one dog\r\nshowing occasional superiority of speed, turning on less ground, and\r\nrunning the whole course with more fire than his opponent, which must be\r\nled to the discretion of the judge, who is to decide on the merits.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL RULES.\r\n\r\nI. The number of members shall be regulated by the letters in the\r\nAlphabet, and the two junior members shall take the letters X and Z, if\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nII. The members shall be elected by ballot, seven to constitute a\r\nballot, and two black balls to exclude.\r\n\r\nIII. The name of every person proposed to be balloted for as a member,\r\nshall be placed over the chimney-piece one day before the ballot can\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nIV. No proposition shall be balloted for unless put up over the\r\nchimney-piece, with the names of the proposer and seconder, at or before\r\ndinner preceding the day of the ballot, and read to the members at such\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nV. Every member shall, at each meeting, run a greyhound his own\r\nproperty, or forfeit a sovereign to the Club.\r\n\r\nVI. No member shall be allowed to match more than two greyhounds in the\r\nfirst class, under a penalty of two sovereigns to the fund, unless such\r\nmember has been drawn or run out for the prizes, in which case he shall\r\nbe allowed to run three dogs in the first class.\r\n\r\nVII. If any member shall absent himself two seasons without sending his\r\nsubscription, he shall be deemed out of the Society, and another chosen\r\nin his place.\r\n\r\nVIII. No greyhound shall be allowed to start if any arrears are due to\r\nthis Society from the owner.\r\n\r\nIX. Any member lending another a greyhound for the purpose of saving his\r\nforfeit (excepting by consent of the members present) shall forfeit five\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nX. Any member running the dog of a stranger in a match shall cause the\r\nname of the owner to be inserted after his own name in the list, under a\r\npenalty of one sovereign.\r\n\r\nXI. No stranger shall be admitted into the Society's room, unless\r\nintroduced by a member, who shall place the name of his friend over the\r\nchimney-piece, with his own attached to it; and no member shall\r\nintroduce more than one friend.\r\n\r\nXII. The members of the [erased] Clubs shall be honorary members of this\r\nSociety, and when present shall be allowed to run their greyhounds on\r\npayment of the annual subscription.\r\n\r\nXIII.
