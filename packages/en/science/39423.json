It was to a\r\ngreat extent rewritten and its range extended in 1856, and it was again\r\nlargely rewritten in 1867. The great advances that have since been made\r\nin systematic botany and in the knowledge of our flora have for several\r\nyears past made another revision desirable, which Dr. Gray before his\r\ndeath was purposing to undertake.\r\n\r\nThe present editors, acting to the best of their ability in his stead,\r\nhave endeavored throughout to follow his methods and views. The original\r\nplan, so long retained by Dr. Gray and so generally approved, has been\r\nclosely adhered to, the characters and descriptions of the last edition\r\nhave been left essentially unchanged so far as possible, and in the\r\nnumerous alterations and additions that have been considered necessary\r\nor advisable, his conclusions and principles have governed in every\r\nmatter of importance, so far as they could be known. The effort\r\nespecially has been to maintain that high standard of excellence which\r\nhas always made the Manual an authority among botanists.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of the genera and species, Gray's Synoptical Flora has\r\nbeen made the basis in the revision of the Gamopetalous Orders, and the\r\nmanuscript in continuation of that work, so far as prepared, for the\r\nPolypetalous Orders which precede _Leguminosae_ (excepting _Nuphar_, the\r\n_Cruciferae, Caryophyllaceae, Vitis_, and the small Orders numbered 18,\r\n22, 23, 25-27, and 29). The genus _Salix_ has been rewritten for this\r\nedition by M. S. BEBB, Esq., the genus _Carex_ by Prof. L. H. BAILEY,\r\nand the Ferns and allied orders by Prof. D. C. EATON. For the rest, all\r\nknown available sources of information have been made use of, and much\r\nwilling help has been received from botanists in all parts of our\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe increasing interest that is taken in the study of the Cellular\r\nCryptogams, and the desire to encourage it, have led to the inclusion\r\nagain of the Hepaticae, which were omitted in the last edition. These\r\nhave been prepared through the kindness of Prof. L. M. UNDERWOOD, though\r\nthe limits of the volume have necessitated somewhat briefer descriptions\r\nthan he considered desirable. The three fine plates illustrating the\r\ngenera of these Orders, which were used in the early editions, are also\r\nadded, with a supplementary one, as well as an additional one in\r\nillustration of the Grasses, thus increasing the number of plates to\r\ntwenty-five. A Glossary of botanical terms is appended, to meet an\r\nexpressed need of those who use the Manual alone, and a Synopsis of the\r\nOrders in their sequence is given, to contrast more clearly their\r\ncharacters, and to show the general principles which have determined\r\ntheir present arrangement. This should be a useful adjunct to the more\r\nartificially arranged Analytical Key.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL LIMITS, AND DISTRIBUTION.--The southern limit of the\r\nterritory covered by the present work is the same as in the later\r\nprevious editions, viz. the southern boundary of Virginia and Kentucky.\r\nThis coincides better than any other geographical line with the natural\r\ndivision between the cooler-temperate and the warm-temperate vegetation\r\nof the Atlantic States. The rapid increase of population west of the\r\nMississippi River, and the growing need of a Manual covering the flora\r\nof that section, have seemed a sufficient reason for the extension of\r\nthe limits of the work westward to the 100th meridian, thus connecting\r\nwith the _Manual of the Flora of the Rocky Mountain Region_ by Prof.\r\nCoulter. These limits, as well as that upon the north, have been in\r\ngeneral strictly observed, very few species being admitted that are not\r\nknown with some degree of certainty to occur within them. The extreme\r\nwestern flora is no doubt imperfectly represented.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the individual species is indicated somewhat more\r\ndefinitely than heretofore in many cases, so far as it could be\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained. The extralimital range is also sometimes\r\ngiven, but the terms \"northward,\" \"southward,\" and \"westward\" are more\r\nfrequently employed, signifying an indefinite range in those directions\r\nbeyond the limits of the Manual. Where no definite habitat is specified,\r\nthe species may be understood as found more or less generally throughout\r\nthe whole area, or at least to near the western limits.\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE, ACCENTUATION OF NAMES, etc.--In case of question\r\nrespecting the proper name to be adopted for any species, Dr. Gray's\r\nknown and expressed views have been followed, it is believed, throughout\r\nthe work. While reasonable regard has been paid to the claims of\r\npriority, the purpose has been to avoid unnecessary changes, in the\r\nbelief that such changes are in most cases an unmitigated evil. Synonyms\r\nare rarely given except where changes have been made. As a guide to\r\ncorrect pronunciation, the long sound of the accented vowel (modified\r\noften in personal names) is indicated, as heretofore, by the grave\r\naccent (`), and the short sound by the acute ('). In regard to the\r\nderivations of generic names, many valuable suggestions have been due to\r\nW. R. Gerard, Esq., of New York.\r\n\r\nPROMINENT CHARACTERS are indicated by the use of _Italic type_ for the\r\nleading distinctions of the Orders, and generally in the specific\r\ndescriptions for those points by which two or more nearly allied species\r\nmay be most readily distinguished. The ready discrimination of the\r\ngenera is provided for by a Synopsis of their leading characters under\r\neach order. Whenever a genus comprises several species, pains have been\r\ntaken to render important differences conspicuous by proper grouping,\r\nand when needed by a series of subordinate divisions and subdivisions.\r\nThe headings of these various groups are to be considered as belonging\r\nto and forming a part of the specific characters of the several species\r\nunder them,--a fact which the student should always bear in mind.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF THE ORDERS.--The Natural Orders are disposed in very\r\nclose accordance with the method followed by Bentham and Hooker in the\r\n_Genera Plantarum_, the principles of which are concisely shown in the\r\nSynopsis of Orders which precedes the Analytical Key. The _Gymnospermae_\r\nare retained as a Subclass following the Angiospermous Dicotyledons,\r\nwith which they have an obvious relationship, in preference to placing\r\nthem, as some authorities would do, next before the Pteridophytes, to\r\nwhich their affinity, if no less certain, is nevertheless obscure. A\r\nmore natural arrangement than either would be the withdrawal of the\r\nEndogens, placing them at the beginning, in perhaps an inverse order.\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL KEY TO THE ORDERS.--As stated in Dr. Gray's Preface to the\r\nlast edition, this is designed to enable the student to refer readily to\r\nits proper Order any of our plants, upon taking the pains to ascertain\r\nthe structure of its flowers, and sometimes of the fruit, and by\r\nfollowing out a series of easy steps in the analysis. It is founded upon\r\nthe most obvious distinctions which will answer the purpose, and is so\r\ncontrived as to provide for all or nearly all exceptional instances and\r\nvariant cases. Referring to the Order which the Key leads him to, the\r\nstudent will find its most distinctive points brought together and\r\nprinted in Italics in the first sentence of the ordinal description, and\r\nthus can verify his results. The Synopsis which follows will then lead\r\nhim to the genus, to be verified in turn by the full generic description\r\nin its place; and the progress thence to the species is facilitated,\r\nwhen there are several to choose from, by the arrangement under\r\ndivisions and subdivisions, as already explained.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Key directs the inquirer to ascertain, first,\r\nthe Class of the plant under consideration,--which, even without the\r\nseeds, is revealed at once by the plan of the stem, as seen in a\r\ncross-section, and usually by the veining of the leaves, and is commonly\r\nconfirmed by the numerical plan of the flower;--then, if of the first\r\nClass, the Subclass is at once determined by the pistil, whether of the\r\nordinary kind, or an open scale bearing naked ovules. If the former,\r\nthen the choice between the three Divisions is determined by the\r\npresence or absence of the petals, and whether separate or united. Each\r\nDivision is subdivided by equally obvious characters, and, finally, a\r\nseries of successively subordinated propositions,--each set more\r\nindented upon the page than the preceding,--leads to the name of the\r\nOrder sought for, followed by the number of the page upon which it is\r\ndescribed in the body of the work.\r\n\r\nThe book is now submitted to those for whose benefit it has been\r\nprepared, in the trust that its shortcomings will meet with friendly\r\nindulgence, and with the earnest request that information be kindly\r\ngiven of any corrections or additions that may appear to be necessary.\r\n\r\n  SERENO WATSON.\r\n  CAMBRIDGE, MASS., Dec. 26, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SYNOPSIS OF THE ORDERS OF PLANT\r\n\r\n                        DESCRIBED IN THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES I.

Differing from Caryophyllaceae\r\nand Portulacaceae by having the ovary and capsule 2--several-celled, and\r\nthe stamens and petals sometimes numerous, as in Cactaceae (but the\r\nlatter wanting in most of the genera), seeds, as in all these orders,\r\nwith the slender embryo curved about mealy albumen. Our genera are\r\napetalous and with the calyx free from the ovary.\r\n\r\n1. Sesuvium. Calyx-lobes 5, petaloid. Stamens 5--60. Capsule\r\ncircumscissile. Succulent.\r\n\r\n2. Mollugo. Sepals 5. Stamens 3 or 5. Capsule 3-valved. Not succulent.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SESUVIUM, L. SEA PURSLANE.\r\n\r\nCalyx 5-parted, purplish inside, persistent, free. Petals none. Stamens\r\n5--60, inserted on the calyx. Styles 3--5, separate. Pod 3--5-celled,\r\nmany-seeded, circumscissile, the upper part falling off as a\r\nlid.--Usually prostrate maritime herbs, with succulent stems, opposite\r\nleaves, and axillary or terminal flowers. (An unexplained name.)\r\n\r\n1. S. pentandrum, Ell. Annual, procumbent or sometimes erect; leaves\r\noblong- to obovate-spatulate, obtuse; flowers sessile, stamens 5. (S.\r\nPortulacastrum, _Gray_, Manual, not _L._)--Sea coast, N. J. to Fla.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. MOLLUGO, L. INDIAN-CHICKWEED.\r\n\r\nSepals 5, white inside.

Stigmas 3.\r\nCapsule 3-celled, 3-valved, loculicidal, the partitions breaking away\r\nfrom the many-seeded axis.--Low homely annuals, much branched, the\r\nstipules obsolete. (An old Latin name for some soft plant.)\r\n\r\nM. VERTICILLATA, L. (CARPET-WEED.) Prostrate, forming patches; leaves\r\nspatulate, clustered in whorls at the joints, where the 1-flowered\r\npedicels form a sort of sessile umbel, stamens usually 3.--Sandy\r\nriver-banks, and cultivated grounds. June--Sept. (An immigrant from\r\nfarther south.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER 48. UMBELLIFERAE. (PARSLEY FAMILY.)\r\n\r\n_Herbs, with small flowers in umbels (or rarely in heads), the calyx\r\nentirely adhering to the 2-celled and 2-ovuled ovary, the 5 petals and 5\r\nstamens inserted on the disk that crowns the ovary and surrounds the\r\nbase of the 2 styles. Fruit consisting of 2 seed-like dry carpels._ Limb\r\nof the calyx obsolete, or a mere 5-toothed border. Petals either\r\nimbricated in the bud or valvate with the point inflexed. The two\r\ncarpels (called _mericarps_) cohering by their inner face (the\r\n_commissure_), when ripe separating from each other and usually\r\nsuspended from the summit of a slender prolongation of the axis\r\n(_carpophore_); each carpel marked lengthwise with _5 primary ribs_, and\r\noften with 4 intermediate (_secondary_) ones; in the _interstices_ or\r\n_intervals_ between them are commonly lodged the oil-tubes (_vittae_),\r\nwhich are longitudinal canals in the substance of the fruit, containing\r\naromatic oil. (These are best seen in slices made across the fruit.)\r\nSeed suspended from the summit of the cell, anatropous, with a minute\r\nembryo in hard albumen.--Stems usually hollow. Leaves alternate, mostly\r\ncompound, the petioles expanded or sheathing at base, rarely with true\r\nstipules. Umbels usually compound, in which case the secondary ones are\r\ntermed _umbellets_; the whorl of bracts which often subtends the general\r\numbel is the _involucre_, and those of the umbellets the _involucels_.\r\nThe base of the styles is frequently thickened and cushion-like, and\r\ncalled the _stylopodium_. In many the flowers are _dichogamous_, i.e.\r\nthe styles are protruded from the bud some time before the anthers\r\ndevelop,--an arrangement for cross-fertilization.--A large family, some\r\nof the plants innocent and aromatic, others with very poisonous\r\n(acrid-narcotic) properties. The flowers are much alike in all, and the\r\nfruits, inflorescence, etc., likewise exhibit comparatively small\r\ndiversity. The family is consequently difficult for the young student.\r\n\r\nI.

The\r\nflowers with a strap-shaped (_ligulate_) corolla are called _rays_ or\r\n_ray-flowers_; the head which presents such flowers, either throughout\r\nor at the margin, is _radiate_. The tubular flowers compose the _disk_;\r\nand a head which has no ray-flowers is said to be _discoid_. When the\r\nhead contains two sorts of flowers it is said to be _heterogamous_; when\r\nonly one sort, _homogamous_. The leaves of the involucre, of whatever\r\nform or texture, are termed _scales_. The bracts or scales, which often\r\ngrow on the receptacle among the flowers, are called the _chaff_; when\r\nthese are wanting, the receptacle is said to be _naked_.--The largest\r\norder of Phaenogamous plants.

CAREX, Ruppius. SEDGE. (By L. H. BAILEY.)\r\n\r\nFlowers unisexual, destitute of floral envelopes, disposed in spikes;\r\nthe staminate consisting of three stamens, in the axil of a bract, or\r\n_scale_; the pistillate comprising a single pistil with a bifid or\r\ntrifid style, forming in fruit a hard lenticular or triangular achene,\r\nwhich is enclosed in a sac (_perigynium_) formed by the complete union\r\nof the borders of a bractlet or of connate bractlets and borne in the\r\naxil of a bract, or _scale_. Staminate and pistillate flowers borne in\r\ndifferent parts of the spike (spike _androgynous_), or in separate\r\nspikes on the same culm, or rarely the plant dioecious.--Perennial\r\ngrass-like herbs with mostly triangular culms, 3-ranked leaves, usually\r\nwith rough margins and keel, and spikes in the axils of leafy or\r\nscale-like bracts, often aggregated into heads.

A maritime variety, much resembling var. glaucum, _Boiss._\r\n(A. glaucum, _R. & S._), with large crowded 5--10-flowered spikelets and\r\nglumes very blunt or mucronate, glaucous and the leaves rather rigid and\r\npungent, occurs on the coast of Maine (Cape Elizabeth, _Tuckerman_). In\r\nthe more usual form of this variety, with the large spikes often\r\nelongated (3--9') and the leaves less rigid, the glumes are acuminate or\r\nrarely short-awned. The rhachis or the whole inflorescence and the lower\r\nsheaths are sometimes very pubescent. The glabrous state, or a very\r\nsimilar glabrous variety, is also abundant in the western region, from\r\nKan. and Neb. to Dak., and westward, where it is known as _Blue-joint_\r\nor _Blue-stem_.

The macrospores are in the shape of a low\r\ntriangular pyramid with a hemispherical base, and marked with elevated\r\nribs along the angles. In germination they develop a minute prothallus\r\nwhich bears archegonia to be fertilized by antherozoids developed from\r\nthe microspores.\r\n\r\n1. Selaginella. Terrestrial; stems slender; leaves small; sporangia\r\nminute and axillary.\r\n\r\n2. Isoetes.

Sporangia pretty large, orbicular or ovoid,\r\nplano-convex, very thin, sessile in the axils of the leaves, and united\r\nat the back with their excavated bases (the thin edges of the excavation\r\nfolding round partly cover them, forming the _velum_), traversed\r\ninternally by transverse threads; those of the outer leaves filled with\r\nlarge spherical macrospores, their whitish crustaceous integument marked\r\nby one circular, and on the upper surface by three radiating elevated\r\nlines (circumscribing a lower hemisphere, and three upper segments which\r\nopen valve-like in germination); those of the inner leaves filled with\r\nvery minute and powdery grayish microspores; these are always obliquely\r\noblong and triangular.--Mostly small aquatics, grass-like or rush-like\r\nin aspect, some always submerged, others amphibious, a few living in\r\nmerely moist soil, maturing their fruit in late summer and early autumn,\r\nexcept n. 7 and some forms of n. 6.\r\n\r\nThis genus is left essentially as it was elaborated for the 5th edition\r\nby the late Dr. GEORGE ENGELMANN.

MARSILIA, L. (Pl. 25.)\r\n\r\nSubmersed or emersed aquatic plants, with slender creeping rootstocks,\r\nsending up elongated petioles, which bear at the apex a whorl of four\r\nnervose-veined leaflets, and at or near their base, or sometimes on the\r\nrootstock, one or more ovoid sporocarps. These sporocarps or fruit\r\nusually have two teeth near the base, and are 2-celled vertically, with\r\nmany transverse partitions, and split or burst into 2 valves at\r\nmaturity. The sporocarps have a ring along the edges of the valves,\r\nwhich at length swells up and bears the sausage-shaped compartments from\r\ntheir places.

The fertilized archegonium develops into a capsule\r\n(_sporogonium_) closely invested by a calyptra, which ruptures above as\r\nthe ripened capsule (containing numerous spores and usually elaters)\r\npushes upward. It is also commonly surrounded by a usually double\r\ninvolucre, the inner (often called _perianth_) more or less tubular, the\r\nouter tubular or more often foliaceous, sometimes wholly wanting.\r\nPropagation is also effected by offshoots (_innovations_), runners\r\n(_flagella_), or by _gemmae_, which appear at the margin of the leaves or\r\non the surface of the thallus, often in special receptacles.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER 137.
