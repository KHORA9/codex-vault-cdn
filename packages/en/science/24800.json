Romanes\r\n\r\n      To\r\n      Edward C. Hegeler Esq.\r\n      La Salle, Ill. U. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Lord Rosebery founded, in the University of Edinburgh,\r\na lectureship on \"The Philosophy of Natural History,\" and I was invited\r\nby the Senatus to deliver the lectures. This invitation I accepted, and\r\nsubsequently constituted the material of my lectures the foundation of\r\nanother course, which was given in the Royal Institution, under the\r\ntitle \"Before and after Darwin.\" Here the course extended over three\r\nyears--namely from 1888 to 1890. The lectures for 1888 were devoted to\r\nthe history of biology from the earliest recorded times till the\r\npublication of the \"Origin of Species\" in 1859; the lectures for 1889\r\ndealt with the theory of organic evolution up to the date of Mr.\r\nDarwin's death, in 1882; while those of the third year discussed the\r\nfurther developments of this theory from that date till the close of the\r\ncourse in 1890.\r\n\r\nIt is from these two courses--which resembled each other in comprising\r\nbetween thirty and forty lectures, but differed largely in other\r\nrespects--that the present treatise has grown. Seeing, however, that it\r\nhas grown much beyond the bulk of the original lectures, I have thought\r\nit desirable to publish the whole in the form of three separate works.\r\nOf these the first--or that which deals with the purely historical side\r\nof biological science--may be allowed to stand over for an indefinite\r\ntime. The second is the one which is now brought out and which, as its\r\nsub-title signifies, is devoted to the general theory of organic\r\nevolution as this was left by the stupendous labours of Darwin. As soon\r\nas the translations shall have been completed, the third portion will\r\nfollow (probably in the Autumn season), under the sub-title,\r\n\"Post-Darwinian Questions.\"\r\n\r\nAs the present volume is thus intended to be merely a systematic\r\nexposition of what may be termed the Darwinism of Darwin, and as on this\r\naccount it is likely to prove of more service to general readers than to\r\nprofessed naturalists, I have been everywhere careful to avoid assuming\r\neven the most elementary knowledge of natural science on the part of\r\nthose to whom the exposition is addressed. The case, however, will be\r\ndifferent as regards the next volume, where I shall have to deal with\r\nthe important questions touching Heredity, Utility, Isolation, &c.,\r\nwhich have been raised since the death of Mr. Darwin, and which are now\r\nbeing debated with such salutary vehemence by the best naturalists of\r\nour time.\r\n\r\nMy obligations to the Senatus of the University of Edinburgh, and to the\r\nBoard of Management of the Royal Institution, have already been\r\nvirtually expressed; but I should like to take this opportunity of also\r\nexpressing my obligations to the students who attended the lectures in\r\nthe University of Edinburgh. For alike in respect of their large\r\nnumbers, their keen intelligence, and their generous sympathy, the\r\nmembers of that voluntary class yielded a degree of stimulating\r\nencouragement, without which the labour of preparing the original\r\nlectures could not have been attended with the interest and the\r\nsatisfaction that I found in it. My thanks are also due to Mr. R. E.\r\nHolding for the painstaking manner in which he has assisted me in\r\nexecuting most of the original drawings with which this volume is\r\nillustrated; and likewise to Messrs. Macmillan and Co. for kindly\r\nallowing me to reprint--without special acknowledgment in every\r\ncase--certain passages from an essay which they published for me many\r\nyears ago, under the title \"Scientific Evidences of Organic Evolution.\"\r\nLastly, I must mention that I am indebted to the same firm for\r\npermission to reproduce an excellent portrait of Mr. Darwin, which\r\nconstitutes the frontispiece.\r\n\r\nG.

I allude to the profound modification which that work has\r\nproduced on the ideas of naturalists with regard to method.\r\n\r\nHaving had occasion of late years somewhat closely to follow the history\r\nof biological science, I have everywhere observed that progress is not\r\nso much marked by the march of discovery _per se_, as by the altered\r\nviews of method which the march has involved. If we except what\r\nAristotle called \"the first start\" in himself, I think one may fairly\r\nsay that from the rejuvenescence of biology in the sixteenth century to\r\nthe stage of growth which it has now reached in the nineteenth, there is\r\na direct proportion to be found between the value of work done and the\r\ndegree in which the worker has thereby advanced the true conception of\r\nscientific working. Of course, up to a certain point, it is notorious\r\nthat the revolt against the purely \"subjective methods\" in the sixteenth\r\ncentury revived the spirit of _inductive_ research as this had been left\r\nby the Greeks; but even with regard to this revolt there are two things\r\nwhich I should like to observe.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it seems to me, an altogether disproportionate value\r\nhas been assigned to Bacon's share in the movement. At most, I think, he\r\ndeserves to be regarded but as a literary exponent of the _Zeitgeist_ of\r\nhis century. Himself a philosopher, as distinguished from a man of\r\nscience, whatever influence his preaching may have had upon the general\r\npublic, it seems little short of absurd to suppose that it could have\r\nproduced any considerable effect upon men who were engaged in the\r\npractical work of research. And those who read the _Novum Organon_ with\r\na first-hand knowledge of what is required for such research can\r\nscarcely fail to agree with his great contemporary Harvey, that he wrote\r\nupon science like a Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe second thing I should like to observe is, that as the revolt against\r\nthe purely subjective methods grew in extent and influence it passed to\r\nthe opposite extreme, which eventually became only less deleterious to\r\nthe interests of science than was the bondage of authority, and\r\naddiction to _a priori_ methods, from which the revolt had set her free.\r\nFor, without here waiting to trace the history of this matter in detail,\r\nI think it ought now to be manifest to everyone who studies it, that up\r\nto the commencement of the present century the progress of science in\r\ngeneral, and of natural history in particular, was seriously retarded by\r\nwhat may be termed the Bugbear of Speculation. Fully awakened to the\r\ndangers of web-spinning from the ever-fertile resources of their own\r\ninner consciousness, naturalists became more and more abandoned to the\r\nidea that their science ought to consist in a mere observation of facts,\r\nor tabulation of phenomena, without attempt at theorizing upon their\r\nphilosophical import. If the facts and phenomena presented any such\r\nimport, that was an affair for men of letters to deal with; but, as men\r\nof science, it was _their_ duty to avoid the seductive temptations of\r\nthe world, the flesh, and the devil, in the form of speculation,\r\ndeduction, and generalization.\r\n\r\nI do not allege that this ideal of natural history was either absolute\r\nor universal; but there can be no question that it was both orthodox and\r\ngeneral. Even Linnaeus was express in his limitations of true scientific\r\nwork in natural history to the collecting and arranging of species of\r\nplants and animals. In accordance with this view, the _status_ of a\r\nbotanist or a zoologist was estimated by the number of specific names,\r\nnatural habitats, &c., which he could retain in his memory, rather than\r\nby any evidences which he might give of intellectual powers in the way\r\nof constructive thought. At the most these powers might legitimately\r\nexercise themselves only in the direction of taxonomic work; and if a\r\nHales, a Haller, or a Hunter obtained any brilliant results in the way\r\nof observation and experiment, their merit was taken to consist in the\r\ndiscovery of facts _per se_: not in any endeavours they might make in\r\nthe way of combining their facts under general principles. Even as late\r\nin the day as Cuvier this ideal was upheld as the strictly legitimate\r\none for a naturalist to follow; and although Cuvier himself was far from\r\nbeing always loyal to it, he leaves no doubt regarding the estimate in\r\nwhich he held the still greater deviations of his colleagues, St.\r\nHilaire and Lamarck.\r\n\r\nNow, these traditional notions touching the severance between the facts\r\nof natural history and the philosophy of it, continued more or less to\r\ndominate the minds of naturalists until the publication of the _Origin\r\nof Species_, in 1859. Then it was that an epoch was marked in this\r\nrespect, as in so many other respects where natural history is\r\nconcerned. For, looking to the enormous results which followed from a\r\ndeliberate disregard of such traditional canons by Darwin, it has long\r\nsince become impossible for naturalists, even of the strictest sect, not\r\nto perceive that their previous bondage to the law of a mere ritual has\r\nbeen for ever superseded by what verily deserves to be regarded as a new\r\ndispensation. Yet it cannot be said, or even so much as suspected, that\r\nDarwin's method in any way resembled that of pre-scientific days, the\r\nrevolt against which led to the straight-laced--and for a long time most\r\nsalutary--conceptions of method that we have just been noticing. Where,\r\nthen, is the difference? To me it seems that the difference is as\r\nfollows; and, if so, that not the least of our many obligations to\r\nDarwin as the great organizer of biological science arises from his\r\nhaving clearly displayed the true principle which ought to govern\r\nbiological research.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, he nowhere loses sight of the primary distinction between\r\nfact and theory; so that, thus far, he loyally follows the spirit of\r\nrevolt against subjective methods. But, while always holding this\r\ndistinction clearly in view, his idea of the scientific use of facts is\r\nplainly that of furnishing legitimate material for the construction of\r\ntheories. Natural history is not to him an affair of the herbarium or\r\nthe cabinet. The collectors and the species-framers are, as it were, his\r\ndiggers of clay and makers of bricks: even the skilled observers and the\r\ntrained experimentalists are his mechanics. Valuable as the work of all\r\nthese men is in itself, its principal value, as he has finally\r\ndemonstrated, is that which it acquires in rendering possible the work\r\nof the architect. Therefore, although he has toiled in all the trades\r\nwith his own hands, and in each has accomplished some of the best work\r\nthat has ever been done, the great difference between him and most of\r\nhis predecessors consists in this,--that while to them the discovery or\r\naccumulation of facts was an end, to him it is the means. In their eyes\r\nit was enough that the facts should be discovered and recorded. In his\r\neyes the value of facts is due to their power of guiding the mind to a\r\nfurther discovery of principles. And the extraordinary success which\r\nattended his work in this respect of _generalization_ immediately\r\nbrought natural history into line with the other inductive sciences,\r\nbehind which, in this most important of all respects, she has so\r\nseriously fallen. For it was the _Origin of Species_ which first clearly\r\nrevealed to naturalists as a class, that it was the duty of their\r\nscience to take as its motto, what is really the motto of natural\r\nscience in general,\r\n\r\n  Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.\r\n\r\nNot facts, then, or phenomena, but causes or principles, are the\r\nultimate objects of scientific quest. It remains to ask, How ought this\r\nquest to be prosecuted?\r\n\r\nWell, in the second place, Darwin has shown that next only to the\r\nimportance of clearly distinguishing between facts and theories on the\r\none hand, and of clearly recognising the relation between them on the\r\nother, is the importance of not being scared by the Bugbear of\r\nSpeculation. The spirit of speculation is the same as the spirit of\r\nscience, namely, as we have just seen, a desire to know the causes of\r\nthings. The _hypotheses non fingo_ of Newton, if taken to mean what it\r\nis often understood as meaning, would express precisely the opposite\r\nspirit from that in which all scientific research must necessarily take\r\nits origin. For if it be causes or principles, as distinguished from\r\nfacts or phenomena, that constitute the final aim of scientific\r\nresearch, obviously the advancement of such research can be attained\r\nonly by the framing of hypotheses. And to frame hypotheses is to\r\nspeculate.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the difference between science and speculation is not a\r\ndifference of spirit; nor, thus far, is it a difference of method. The\r\nonly difference between them is in the subsequent process of verifying\r\nhypotheses. For while speculation, in its purest form, is satisfied to\r\ntest her explanations only by the degree in which they accord with our\r\nsubjective ideas of probability--or with the \"Illative Sense\" of\r\nCardinal Newman,--science is not satisfied to rest in any explanation as\r\nfinal until it shall have been fully verified by an appeal to objective\r\nproof. This distinction is now so well and so generally appreciated that\r\nI need not dwell upon it. Nor need I wait to go into any details with\r\nregard to the so-called canons of verification. My only object is to\r\nmake perfectly clear, first, that in order to have any question to put\r\nto the test of objective verification, science must already have so far\r\nemployed the method of speculation as to have framed a question to be\r\ntested; and, secondly, that the point where science parts company with\r\nspeculation is the point where this testing process begins.\r\n\r\nNow, if these things are so, there can be no doubt that Darwin was\r\nfollowing the truest method of inductive research in allowing any amount\r\nof latitude to his speculative thought in the direction of scientific\r\ntheorizing. For it follows from the above distinctions that the danger\r\nof speculation does not reside in the width of its range, or even in the\r\nimpetuosity of its vehemence. Indeed, the wider its reach, and the\r\ngreater its energy, the better will it be for the interests of science.\r\nThe only danger of speculation consists in its momentum being apt to\r\ncarry away the mind from the more laborious work of adequate\r\nverification; and therefore a true scientific judgment consists in\r\ngiving a free rein to speculation on the one hand, while holding ready\r\nthe break of verification with the other. Now, it is just because Darwin\r\ndid both these things with so admirable a judgment, that he gave the\r\nworld of natural history so good a lesson as to the most effectual way\r\nof driving the chariot of science.\r\n\r\nThis lesson we have now all more or less learnt to profit by. Yet no\r\nother naturalist has proved himself so proficient in holding the balance\r\ntrue. For the most part, indeed, they have now all ceased to confound\r\nthe process of speculation _per se_ with the danger of inadequate\r\nverification; and therefore the old ideal of natural history as\r\nconcerned merely with collecting species, classifying affinities, and,\r\nin general, tabulating facts, has been well-nigh universally\r\nsuperseded. But this great gain has been attended by some measure of\r\nloss. For while not a few naturalists have since erred on the side of\r\ninsufficiently distinguishing between fully verified principles of\r\nevolution and merely speculative deductions therefrom, a still larger\r\nnumber have formed for themselves a Darwinian creed, and regard any\r\nfurther theorizing on the subject of evolution as _ipso facto_\r\nunorthodox.\r\n\r\nHaving occupied the best years of my life in closely studying the\r\nliterature of Darwinism, I shall endeavour throughout the following\r\npages to avoid both these extremes. No one in this generation is able to\r\nimitate Darwin, either as an observer or a generalizer. But this does\r\nnot hinder that we should all so far endeavour to follow his _method_,\r\nas always to draw a clear distinction, not merely between observation\r\nand deduction, but also between degrees of verification. At all events,\r\nmy own aim will everywhere be to avoid dogmatism on the one hand, and\r\nundue timidity as regards general reasoning on the other. For everything\r\nthat is said justification will be given; and, as far as prolonged\r\ndeliberation has enabled me to do so, the exact value of such\r\njustification will be rendered by a statement of at least the main\r\ngrounds on which it rests. The somewhat extensive range of the present\r\ntreatise, however, will not admit of my rendering more than a small\r\npercentage of the facts which in each case go to corroborate the\r\nconclusion. But although a great deal must thus be necessarily lost on\r\nthe one side, I am disposed to think that more will be gained on the\r\nother, by presenting, in a terser form than would otherwise be\r\npossible, the whole theory of organic evolution as I believe that it\r\nwill eventually stand. My endeavour, therefore, will be to exhibit the\r\ngeneral structure of this theory in what I take to be its strictly\r\nlogical form, rather than to encumber any of its parts by a lengthy\r\ncitation of facts. Following this method, I shall in each case give only\r\nwhat I consider the main facts for and against the positions which have\r\nto be argued; and in most cases I shall arrange the facts in two\r\ndivisions, namely, first those of largest generality, and next a few of\r\nthe most special character that can be found.\r\n\r\nAs explained in the Preface, the present instalment of the treatise is\r\nconcerned with the theory of evolution, from the appearance of the\r\n_Origin of Species_ in 1859, to the death of its author in 1882; while\r\nthe second part will be devoted to the sundry post-Darwinian questions\r\nwhich have arisen in the subsequent decade. To the possible criticism\r\nthat a disproportionate amount of space will thus be allotted to a\r\nconsideration of these post-Darwinian questions, I may furnish in\r\nadvance the following reply.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, besides the works of Darwin himself, there are a\r\nnumber of others which have already and very admirably expounded the\r\nevidences, both of organic evolution as a fact, and of natural selection\r\nas a cause. Therefore, in the present treatise it seemed needless to go\r\nbeyond the ground which was covered by my original lectures, namely, a\r\ncondensed and connected, while at the same time a critical statement of\r\nthe main evidences, and the main objections, which have thus far been\r\npublished with reference to the distinctively Darwinian theory. Indeed\r\nwhile re-casting this portion of my lectures for the present\r\npublication, I have felt that criticism might be more justly urged from\r\nthe side of impatience at a reiteration of facts and arguments already\r\nso well known. But while endeavouring, as much as possible, to avoid\r\noverlapping the previous expositions, I have not carried this attempt to\r\nthe extent of damaging my own, by omitting any of the more important\r\nheads of evidence; and I have sought to invest the latter with some\r\nmeasure of novelty by making good what appears to me a deficiency which\r\nhas hitherto obtained in the matter of pictorial illustration. In\r\nparticular, there will be found a tolerably extensive series of\r\nwoodcuts, serving to represent the more important products of artificial\r\nselection. These, like all the other original illustrations, have been\r\ndrawn either direct from nature or from a comparative study of the best\r\nauthorities. Nevertheless, I desire it to be understood that the first\r\npart of this treatise is intended to retain its original character, as a\r\nmerely educational exposition of Darwinian teaching--an exposition,\r\ntherefore, which, in its present form, may be regarded as a compendium,\r\nor hand-book, adapted to the requirements of a general reader, or\r\nbiological student as distinguished from those of a professed\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, is different with the second instalment, which will\r\nbe published at no very distant date. Here I have not followed with\r\nnearly so much closeness the material of my original lectures. On the\r\ncontrary, I have had in view a special class of readers; and, although I\r\nhave tried not altogether to sacrifice the more general class, I shall\r\ndesire it to be understood that I am there appealing to naturalists who\r\nare specialists in Darwinism. One must say advisedly, naturalists who\r\nare specialists in Darwinism, because, while the literature of Darwinism\r\nhas become a department of science in itself, there are nowadays many\r\nnaturalists who, without having paid any close attention to the subject,\r\ndeem themselves entitled to hold authoritative opinions with regard to\r\nit. These men may have done admirable work in other departments of\r\nnatural history, and yet their opinions on such matters as we shall\r\nhereafter have to consider may be destitute of value. As there is no\r\nnecessary relation between erudition in one department of science and\r\nsoundness of judgment in another, the mere fact that a man is\r\ndistinguished as a botanist or zoologist does not in itself qualify him\r\nas a critic where specially Darwinian questions are concerned. Thus it\r\nhappens now, as it happened thirty years ago, that highly distinguished\r\nbotanists and zoologists prove themselves incapable as judges of general\r\nreasoning. It was Darwin's complaint that for many years nearly all his\r\nscientific critics either could not, or would not, understand what he\r\nhad written--and this even as regarded the fundamental principles of his\r\ntheory, which with the utmost clearness he had over and over again\r\nrepeated. Now the only difference between such naturalists and their\r\nsuccessors of the present day is, that the latter have grown up in a\r\nDarwinian environment, and so, as already remarked, have more or less\r\nthoughtlessly adopted some form of Darwinian creed. But this scientific\r\ncreed is not a whit less dogmatic and intolerant than was the more\r\ntheological one which it has supplanted; and while it usually\r\nincorporates the main elements of Darwin's teaching, it still more\r\nusually comprises gross perversions of their consequences. All this I\r\nshall have occasion more fully to show in subsequent parts of the\r\npresent work; and allusion is made to the matter here merely for the\r\nsake of observing that in future I shall not pay attention to\r\nunsupported expressions of opinion from any quarter: I shall consider\r\nonly such as are accompanied with some statement of the grounds upon\r\nwhich the opinion is held. And, even as thus limited, I do not think it\r\nwill be found that the following exposition devotes any disproportional\r\namount of attention to the contemporary movements of Darwinian thought,\r\nseeing, as we shall see, how active scientific speculation has been in\r\nthe field of Darwinism since the death of Mr. Darwin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving, then, these post-Darwinian questions to be dealt with\r\nsubsequently, I shall now begin a systematic _resume_ of the evidences\r\nin favour of the Darwinian theory, as this was left to the world by\r\nDarwin himself.\r\n\r\nThere is a great distinction to be drawn between the fact of evolution\r\nand the manner of it, or between the evidence of evolution as having\r\ntaken place somehow, and the evidence of the causes which have been\r\nconcerned in the process. This most important distinction is frequently\r\ndisregarded by popular writers on Darwinism; and, therefore, in order to\r\nmark it as strongly as possible, I will effect a complete separation\r\nbetween the evidence which we have of evolution as a fact, and the\r\nevidence which we have as to its method. In other words, not until I\r\nshall have fully considered the evidence of organic evolution as a\r\nprocess which somehow or another _has_ taken place, will I proceed to\r\nconsider _how_ it has taken place, or the causes which Darwin and others\r\nhave suggested as having probably been concerned in this process.\r\n\r\nConfining, then, our attention in the first instance to a proof of\r\nevolution considered as a fact, without any reference at all to its\r\nmethod, let us begin by considering the antecedent standing of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFirst of all we must clearly recognise that there are only two\r\nhypotheses in the field whereby it is possible so much as to suggest an\r\nexplanation of the origin of species. Either all the species of plants\r\nand animals must have been supernaturally created, or else they must\r\nhave been naturally evolved. There is no third hypothesis possible; for\r\nno one can rationally suggest that species have been eternal.\r\n\r\nNext, be it observed, that the theory of a continuous transmutation of\r\nspecies is not logically bound to furnish a full explanation of _all_\r\nthe natural causes which it may suppose to have been at work. The\r\nradical distinction between the two theories consists in the one\r\nassuming an immediate action of some supernatural or inscrutable cause,\r\nwhile the other assumes the immediate action of natural--and therefore\r\nof possibly discoverable--causes. But in order to sustain this latter\r\nassumption, the theory of descent is under no logical necessity to\r\nfurnish a full proof of _all_ the natural causes which may have been\r\nconcerned in working out the observed results. We do not know the\r\nnatural causes of many diseases; but yet no one nowadays thinks of\r\nreverting to any hypothesis of a supernatural cause, in order to explain\r\nthe occurrence of any disease the natural causation of which is obscure.\r\nThe science of medicine being in so many cases able to explain the\r\noccurrence of disease by its hypothesis of natural causes, medical men\r\nnow feel that they are entitled to assume, on the basis of a wide\r\nanalogy, and therefore on the basis of a strong antecedent presumption,\r\nthat all diseases are due to natural causes, whether or not in\r\nparticular cases such causes happen to have been discovered. And from\r\nthis position it follows that medical men are not logically bound to\r\nentertain any supernatural theory of an obscure disease, merely because\r\nas yet they have failed to find a natural theory. And so it is with\r\nbiologists and their theory of descent. Even if it be fully proved to\r\nthem that the causes which they have hitherto discovered, or suggested,\r\nare inadequate to account for all the facts of organic nature, this\r\nwould in no wise logically compel them to vacate their theory of\r\nevolution, in favour of the theory of creation. All that it would so\r\ncompel them to do would be to search with yet greater diligence for the\r\nnatural causes still undiscovered, but in the existence of which they\r\nare, by their independent evidence in favour of the theory, bound to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nIn short, the issue is not between the theory of a supernatural cause\r\nand the theory of any one particular natural cause, or set of\r\ncauses--such as natural selection, use, disuse, and so forth. The issue\r\nthus far--or where only the _fact_ of evolution is concerned--is between\r\nthe theory of a supernatural cause as operating immediately in\r\nnumberless acts of special creation, and the theory of natural causes as\r\na whole, whether these happen, or do not happen, to have been hitherto\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThis much by way of preliminaries being understood, we have next to\r\nnotice that whichever of the two rival theories we choose to entertain,\r\nwe are not here concerned with any question touching the origin of life.\r\nWe are concerned only with the origin of particular forms of life--that\r\nis to say, with the origin of species. The theory of descent starts from\r\nlife as a _datum_ already granted. How life itself came to be, the\r\ntheory of descent, as such, is not concerned to show. Therefore, in the\r\npresent discussion, I will take the existence of life as a fact which\r\ndoes not fall within the range of our present discussion. No doubt the\r\nquestion as to the origin of life is in itself a deeply interesting\r\nquestion, and although in the opinion of most biologists it is a\r\nquestion which we may well hope will some day fall within the range of\r\nscience to answer, at present, it must be confessed, science is not in a\r\nposition to furnish so much as any suggestion upon the subject; and\r\ntherefore our wisdom as men of science is frankly to acknowledge that\r\nsuch is the case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to observe that the theory of organic evolution\r\nis strongly recommended to our acceptance on merely antecedent grounds,\r\nby the fact that it is in full accordance with what is known as the\r\nprinciple of continuity. By the principle of continuity is meant the\r\nuniformity of nature, in virtue of which the many and varied processes\r\ngoing on in nature are due to the same kind of method, i. e. the method\r\nof natural causation. This conception of the uniformity of nature is\r\none that has only been arrived at step by step through a long and\r\narduous course of human experience in the explanation of natural\r\nphenomena. The explanations of such phenomena which are first given are\r\nalways of the supernatural kind; it is not until investigation has\r\nrevealed the natural causes which are concerned that the hypotheses of\r\nsuperstition give way to those of science. Thus it follows that the\r\nhypotheses of superstition which are the latest in yielding to the\r\nexplanations of science, are those which refer to the more recondite\r\ncases of natural causation; for here it is that methodical investigation\r\nis longest in discovering the natural causes. Thus it is only by degrees\r\nthat fetishism is superseded by what now appears a common-sense\r\ninterpretation of physical phenomena; that exorcism gives place to\r\nmedicine; alchemy to chemistry; astrology to astronomy; and so forth.\r\nEverywhere the miraculous is progressively banished from the field of\r\nexplanation by the advance of scientific discovery; and the places where\r\nit is left longest in occupation are those where the natural causes are\r\nmost intricate or obscure, and thus present the greatest difficulty to\r\nthe advancing explanations of science. Now, in our own day there are but\r\nvery few of these strongholds of the miraculous left. Nearly the whole\r\nfield of explanation is occupied by naturalism, so that no one ever\r\nthinks of resorting to supernaturalism except in the comparatively few\r\ncases where science has not yet been able to explore the most obscure\r\nregions of causation. One of these cases is the origin of life; and,\r\nuntil quite recently, another of these cases was the origin of species.\r\nBut now that a very reasonable explanation of the origin of species has\r\nbeen offered by science, it is but in accordance with all previous\r\nhistorical analogies that many minds should prove themselves unable all\r\nat once to adjust themselves to the new ideas, and thus still linger\r\nabout the more venerable ideas of supernaturalism. But we are now in\r\npossession of so many of these historical analogies, that all minds with\r\nany instincts of science in their composition have grown to distrust, on\r\nmerely antecedent grounds, any explanation which embodies a miraculous\r\nelement. Such minds have grown to regard all these explanations as mere\r\nexpressions of our own ignorance of natural causation; or, in other\r\nwords, they have come to regard it as an _a priori_ truth that nature is\r\neverywhere uniform in respect of method or causation; that the reign of\r\nlaw universal; the principle of continuity ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nNow, it must be obvious to any mind which has adopted this attitude of\r\nthought, that the scientific theory of natural descent is recommended by\r\nan overwhelming weight of antecedent presumption, as against the\r\ndogmatic theory of supernatural design.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we must remember that the fact of evolution--or, which is\r\nthe same thing, the fact of continuity in natural causation--has now\r\nbeen unquestionably proved in so many other and analogous departments of\r\nnature, that to suppose any interruption of this method as between\r\nspecies and species becomes, on grounds of such analogy alone, well-nigh\r\nincredible. For example, it is now a matter of demonstrated fact that\r\nthroughout the range of _inorganic_ nature the principles of evolution\r\nhave obtained. It is no longer possible for any one to believe with our\r\nforefathers that the earth's surface has always existed as it now\r\nexists. For the science of geology has proved to demonstration that seas\r\nand lands are perpetually undergoing gradual changes of relative\r\npositions--continents and oceans supplanting each other in the course of\r\nages, mountain-chains being slowly uplifted, again as slowly denuded,\r\nand so forth. Moreover, and as a closer analogy, within the limits of\r\nanimate nature we know it is the universal law that every individual\r\nlife undergoes a process of gradual development; and that breeds, races,\r\nor strains, may be brought into existence by the intentional use of\r\nnatural processes--the results bearing an unmistakeable resemblance to\r\nwhat we know as natural species. Again, even in the case of natural\r\nspecies themselves, there are two considerations which present enormous\r\nforce from an antecedent point of view. The first is that organic forms\r\nare only then recognised as species when intermediate forms are absent.\r\nIf the intermediate forms are actually living, or admit of being found\r\nin the fossil state, naturalists forthwith regard the whole series as\r\nvarieties, and name all the members of it as belonging to the same\r\nspecies. Consequently it becomes obvious that naturalists, in their work\r\nof naming species, may only have been marking out the cases where\r\nintermediate or connecting forms have been lost to observation. For\r\nexample, here we have a diagram representing a very unusually complete\r\nseries of fossil shells, which within the last few years has been\r\nunearthed from the Tertiary lake basins of Slavonia. Before the series\r\nwas completed, some six or eight of the then disconnected forms were\r\ndescribed as distinct species; but as soon as the connecting forms were\r\nfound--showing a progressive modification from the older to the newer\r\nbeds,--the whole were included as varieties of one species.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Successive forms of Paludina, from the\r\n    Tertiary deposits of Slavonia (after Neumayr).]\r\n\r\nOf course, other cases of the same kind might be adduced, and therefore,\r\nas just remarked, in their work of naming species naturalists may only\r\nhave been marking out the cases where intermediate forms have been lost\r\nto observation. And this possibility becomes little less than a\r\ncertainty when we note the next consideration which I have to adduce,\r\nnamely, that in all their systematic divisions of plants and animals in\r\ngroups higher than species--such as genera, families, orders, and the\r\nrest--naturalists have at all times recognised the fact that the one\r\nshades off into the other by such imperceptible gradations, that it is\r\nimpossible to regard such divisions as other than conventional. It is\r\nimportant to remember that this fact was fully recognised before the\r\ndays of Darwin. In those days the scientifically orthodox doctrine was,\r\nthat although species were to be regarded as fixed units, bearing the\r\nstamp of a special creation, all the higher taxonomic divisions were\r\nto be considered as what may be termed the artificial creation of\r\nnaturalists themselves. In other words, it was believed, and in many\r\ncases known, that if we could go far enough back in the history of the\r\nearth, we should everywhere find a tendency to mutual approximation\r\nbetween allied _groups of species_; so that, for instance, birds and\r\nreptiles would be found to be drawing nearer and nearer together, until\r\neventually they would seem to become fused in a single type; that the\r\nexisting distinctions between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals\r\nwould be found to do likewise; and so on with all the larger\r\ngroup-distinctions, at any rate within the limits of the same\r\nsub-kingdoms. But although naturalists recognised this even in the\r\npre-Darwinian days, they stoutly believed that a great exception was to\r\nbe made in the case of species. These, the lowest or initial members of\r\ntheir taxonomic series, they supposed to be permanent--the miraculously\r\ncreated units of organic nature. Now, all that I have at present to\r\nremark is, that this pre-Darwinian exception which was made in favour of\r\nspecies to the otherwise recognised principle of gradual change, was an\r\nexception which can at no time have been recommended by any antecedent\r\nconsiderations. At all times it stood out of analogy with the principle\r\nof continuity; and, as we shall fully find in subsequent chapters, it is\r\nnow directly contradicted by all the facts of biological science.\r\n\r\nThere remains one other fact of high generality to which prominent\r\nattention should be drawn from the present, or merely antecedent, point\r\nof view. On the theory of special creation no reason can be assigned why\r\ndistinct specific types should present any correlation, either in time\r\nor in space, with their nearest allies; for there is evidently no\r\nconceivable reason why any given species, A, should have been specially\r\ncreated on the same area and at about the same time as its nearest\r\nrepresentative, B,--still less, of course, that such should be a general\r\nrule throughout all the thousands and millions of species which have\r\never inhabited the earth. But, equally of course, on the theory of a\r\nnatural evolution this is so necessary a consequence, that if no\r\ncorrelation of such a two-fold kind were observable, the theory would be\r\nnegatived. Thus the question whether there be any indication of such a\r\ntwo-fold correlation may be regarded as a test-question as between the\r\ntwo theories; for although the vast majority of extinct species have\r\nbeen lost to science, there are a countless number of existing species\r\nwhich furnish ample material for answering the question. And the answer\r\nis so unequivocal that Mr. Wallace, who is one of our greatest\r\nauthorities on geographical distribution, has laid it down as a general\r\nlaw, applicable to all the departments of organic nature, that, so far\r\nas observation can extend, \"every species has come into existence\r\ncoincident both in space and time with a pre-existing and closely allied\r\nspecies.\" As it appears to me that the significance of these words\r\ncannot be increased by any comment upon them, I will here bring this\r\nintroductory chapter to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first line of direct evidence in favour of organic evolution which I\r\nshall open is that which may be termed the argument from Classification.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of observable fact that different forms of plants and\r\nanimals present among themselves more or less pronounced resemblances.\r\nFrom the earliest times, therefore, it has been the aim of philosophical\r\nnaturalists to classify plants and animals in accordance with these\r\nresemblances. Of course the earliest attempts at such classification\r\nwere extremely crude. The oldest of these attempts with which we are\r\nacquainted--namely, that which is presented in the books of Genesis and\r\nLeviticus--arranges the whole vegetable kingdom in three simple\r\ndivisions of Grass, Herbs, and Trees; while the animal kingdom is\r\narranged with almost equal simplicity with reference, first to habitats\r\nin water, earth, or air, and next as to modes of progression. These, of\r\ncourse, were what may be termed common-sense classifications, having\r\nreference merely to external appearances and habits of life. But when\r\nAristotle laboriously investigated the comparative anatomy of animals,\r\nhe could not fail to perceive that their entire structures had to be\r\ntaken into account in order to classify them scientifically; and, also,\r\nthat for this purpose the internal parts were of quite as much\r\nimportance as the external. Indeed, he perceived that they were of\r\ngreatly more importance in this respect, inasmuch as they presented so\r\nmany more points for comparison; and, in the result, he furnished an\r\nastonishingly comprehensive, as well as an astonishingly accurate\r\nclassification of the larger groups of the animal kingdom. On the other\r\nhand, classification of the vegetable kingdom continued pretty much as\r\nit had been left by the book of Genesis--all plants being divided into\r\nthree groups, Herbs, Shrubs, and Trees. Nor was this primitive state of\r\nmatters improved upon till the sixteenth century, when Gesner\r\n(1516-1565), and still more Caesalpino (1519-1603), laid the foundations\r\nof systematic botany.\r\n\r\nBut the more that naturalists prosecuted their studies on the anatomy of\r\nplants and animals, the more enormously complex did they find the\r\nproblem of classification become. Therefore they began by forming what\r\nare called artificial systems, in contradistinction to natural systems.\r\nAn artificial system of classification is a system based on the more or\r\nless arbitrary selection of some one part, or set of parts; while a\r\nnatural classification is one that is based upon a complete knowledge of\r\nall the structures of all the organisms which are classified.\r\n\r\nThus, the object of classification has been that of arranging organisms\r\nin accordance with their natural affinities, by comparing organism with\r\norganism, for the purpose of ascertaining which of the constituent\r\norgans are of the most invariable occurrence, and therefore of the most\r\ntypical signification. A porpoise, for instance, has a large number of\r\nteeth, and in this feature resembles most fish, while it differs from\r\nall mammals. But it also gives suck to its young. Now, looking to these\r\ntwo features alone, should we say that a porpoise ought to be classed as\r\na fish or as a mammal? Assuredly as a mammal; because the number of\r\nteeth is a very variable feature both in fish and mammals, whereas the\r\ngiving of suck is an invariable feature among mammals, and occurs\r\nnowhere else in the animal kingdom. This, of course, is chosen as a very\r\nsimple illustration. Were all cases as obvious, there would be but\r\nlittle distinction between natural and artificial systems of\r\nclassification. But it is because the lines of natural affinity are, as\r\nit were, so interwoven throughout the organic world, and because there\r\nis, in consequence, so much difficulty in following them, that\r\nartificial systems have to be made in the first instance as feelers\r\ntowards eventual discovery of the natural system. In other words, while\r\nforming their artificial systems of classification, it has always been\r\nthe aim of naturalists--whether consciously or unconsciously--to admit\r\nas the bases of their systems those characters which, in the then state\r\nof their knowledge, seemed most calculated to play an important part in\r\nthe eventual construction of the natural system. If we were dealing with\r\nthe history of classification, it would here be interesting to note how\r\nthe course of it has been marked by gradual change in the principles\r\nwhich naturalists adopted as guides to the selection of characters on\r\nwhich to found their attempts at a natural classification. Some of these\r\nchanges, indeed, I shall have to mention later on; but at present what\r\nhas to be specially noted is, that through all these changes of theory\r\nor principle, and through all the ever-advancing construction of their\r\ntaxonomic science, naturalists themselves were unable to give any\r\nintelligible reason for the faith that was in them--or the faith that\r\nover and above the artificial classifications which were made for the\r\nmere purpose of cataloguing the living library of organic nature, there\r\nwas deeply hidden in nature itself a truly natural classification, for\r\nthe eventual discovery of which artificial systems might prove to be of\r\nmore or less assistance.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus, for example, expressly says--\"You ask me for the characters of\r\nthe natural orders; I confess that I cannot give them.\" Yet he maintains\r\nthat, although he cannot define the characters, he knows, by a sort of\r\nnaturalist's instinct, what in a general way will subsequently be found\r\nto be the organs of most importance in the eventual grouping of plants\r\nunder a natural system. \"I will not give my reasons for the distribution\r\nof the natural orders which I have published,\" he said: \"you, or some\r\nother person, after twenty or after fifty years, will discover them, and\r\nsee that I was right.\"\r\n\r\nThus we perceive that in forming their provisional or artificial\r\nclassifications, naturalists have been guided by an instinctive belief\r\nin some general principle of natural affinity, the character of which\r\nthey have not been able to define; and that the structures which they\r\nselected as the bases of their classifications when these were\r\nconsciously artificial, were selected because it seemed that they were\r\nthe structures most likely to prove of use in subsequent attempts at\r\nworking out the natural system.\r\n\r\nThis general principle of natural affinity, of which all naturalists\r\nhave seen more or less well-marked evidence in organic nature, and after\r\nwhich they have all been feeling, has sometimes been regarded as\r\nnatural, but more often as supernatural. Those who regarded it as\r\nsupernatural took it to consist in a divine ideal of creation according\r\nto types, so that the structural affinities of organisms were to them\r\nexpressions of an archetypal plan, which might be revealed in its\r\nentirety when all organisms on the face of the earth should have been\r\nexamined. Those, on the other hand, who regarded the general principle\r\nof affinity as depending on some natural causes, for the most part\r\nconcluded that these must have been utilitarian causes; or, in other\r\nwords, that the fundamental affinities of structure must have depended\r\nupon fundamental requirements of function. According to this view, the\r\nnatural classification would eventually be found to stand upon a basis\r\nof physiology. Therefore all the systems of classification up to the\r\nearlier part of the present century went upon the apparent axiom, that\r\ncharacters which are of most importance to the organisms presenting them\r\nmust be characters most indicative of natural affinities. But the truth\r\nof the matter was eventually found to be otherwise. For it was\r\neventually found that there is absolutely no correlation between these\r\ntwo things; that, therefore, it is a mere chance whether or not organs\r\nwhich are of importance to organisms are likewise of importance as\r\nguides to classification; and, in point of fact, that the general\r\ntendency in this matter is towards an inverse instead of a direct\r\nproportion. More often than not, the greater the value of a structure\r\nfor the purpose of indicating natural affinities, the less is its value\r\nto the creatures presenting it.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to show three things. First, that long before\r\nthe theory of descent was entertained by naturalists, naturalists\r\nperceived the fact of natural affinities, and did their best to\r\nconstruct a natural system of classification for the purpose of\r\nexpressing such affinities. Second, that naturalists had a kind of\r\ninstinctive belief in some one principle running through the whole\r\norganic world, which thus served to bind together organisms in groups\r\nsubordinate to groups--that is, into species, genera, orders, families,\r\nclasses, sub-kingdoms, and kingdoms. Third, that they were not able to\r\ngive any very intelligible reason for this faith that was in them;\r\nsometimes supposing the principle in question to be that of a\r\nsupernatural plan of organization, sometimes regarding it as dependent\r\non conditions of physiology, and sometimes not attempting to account for\r\nit at all.\r\n\r\nOf course it is obvious that the theory of descent furnishes the\r\nexplanation which is required. For it is now evident to evolutionists,\r\nthat although these older naturalists did not know what they were doing\r\nwhen they were tracing these lines of natural affinity, and thus helping\r\nto construct a natural classification--I say it is now evident to\r\nevolutionists that these naturalists were simply tracing the lines of\r\ngenetic relationship. The great principle pervading organic nature,\r\nwhich was seen so mysteriously to bind the whole creation together as in\r\na nexus of organic affinity, is now easily understood as nothing more or\r\nless than the principle of Heredity. Let us, therefore, look a little\r\nmore closely at the character of this network, in order to see how far\r\nit lends itself to this new interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that we have to observe about the nexus is, that it is a\r\nnexus--not a single line, or even a series of parallel lines. In other\r\nwords, some time before the theory of descent was seriously entertained,\r\nnaturalists for the most part had fully recognised that it was\r\nimpossible to arrange either plants or animals, with respect to their\r\nmutual affinities, in a ladder-like series (as was supposed to be the\r\ntype of classification by the earlier systematists), or even in map-like\r\ngroups (as was supposed to be the type by Linnaeus). And similarly, also,\r\nwith respect to grades of organization. In the case of the larger\r\ngroups, indeed, it is usually possible to say that the members of this\r\ngroup as a whole are more highly organized than the members of that\r\ngroup as a whole; so that, for instance, we have no hesitation in\r\nregarding the Vertebrata as more highly organized than the Invertebrata,\r\nBirds than Reptiles, and so on. But when we proceed to smaller\r\nsubdivisions, such as genera and species, it is usually impossible to\r\nsay that the one type is more highly organized than another type. A\r\nhorse, for instance, cannot be said to be more highly organized than a\r\nzebra or an ass; although the entire horse-genus is clearly a more\r\nhighly organized type than any genus of animal which is not a mammal.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, therefore, the system of classification which\r\nwas eventually arrived at before the days of Darwin, was the system\r\nwhich naturalists likened to a tree; and this is the system which all\r\nnaturalists now agreed upon as the true one. According to this system, a\r\nshort trunk may be taken to represent the lowest organisms which cannot\r\nproperly be termed either plants or animals. This short trunk soon\r\nseparates into two large trunks, one of which represents the vegetable\r\nand the other the animal kingdom. Each of these trunks then gives off\r\nlarge branches signifying classes, and these give off smaller, but more\r\nnumerous branches, signifying families, which ramify again into orders,\r\ngenera, and finally into the leaves, which may be taken to represent\r\nspecies. Now, in such a representative tree of life, the height of any\r\nbranch from the ground may be taken to indicate the grade of\r\norganization which the leaves, or species, present; so that, if we\r\npicture to ourselves such a tree, we may understand that while there is\r\na general advance of organization from below upwards, there are many\r\ndeviations in this respect. Sometimes leaves growing on the same branch\r\nare growing at a different level--especially, of course, if the branch\r\nbe a large one, corresponding to a class or sub-kingdom. And sometimes\r\nleaves growing on different branches are growing at the same level: that\r\nis to say, although they represent species belonging to widely divergent\r\nfamilies, orders, or even classes, it cannot be said that the one\r\nspecies is more highly organized than the other.\r\n\r\nNow, this tree-like arrangement of species in nature is an arrangement\r\nfor which Darwin is not responsible. For, as we have seen, the detecting\r\nof it has been due to the progressive work of naturalists for centuries\r\npast; and even when it was detected, at about the commencement of the\r\npresent century, naturalists were confessedly unable to explain the\r\nreason of it, or what was the underlying principle that they were\r\nengaged in tracing when they proceeded ever more and more accurately to\r\ndefine these ramifications of natural affinity. But now, as just\r\nremarked, we can clearly perceive that this underlying principle was\r\nnone other than Heredity as expressed in family likeness,--likeness,\r\ntherefore, growing progressively more unlike with remoteness of\r\nancestral relationship. For thus only can we obtain any explanation of\r\nthe sundry puzzles and apparent paradoxes, which a working out of their\r\nnatural classifications revealed to botanists and zoologists during the\r\nfirst half of the present century. It will now be my endeavour to show\r\nhow these puzzles and paradoxes are all explained by the theory that\r\nnatural affinities are merely the expression of genetic affinities.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, and from the most general point of view, it is obvious\r\nthat the tree-like system of classification, which Darwin found already\r\nand empirically worked out by the labours of his predecessors, is as\r\nsuggestive as anything could well be of the fact of genetic\r\nrelationship. For this is the form that every tabulation of family\r\npedigree must assume; and therefore the mere fact that a scientific\r\ntabulation of natural affinities was eventually found to take the form\r\nof a tree, is in itself highly suggestive of the inference that such a\r\ntabulation represents a _family_ tree. If all species were separately\r\ncreated, there can be no assignable reason why the ideas of earlier\r\nnaturalists touching the form which a natural classification would\r\neventually assume should not have represented the truth--why, for\r\nexample, it should not have assumed the form of a ladder (as was\r\nanticipated in the seventeenth century), or of a map (as was anticipated\r\nin the eighteenth), or, again, of a number of wholly unrelated lines,\r\ncircles, &c. (as certain speculative writers of the present century have\r\nimagined). But, on the other hand, if all species were separately and\r\nindependently created, it becomes virtually incredible that we should\r\neverywhere observe this progressive arborescence of characters common to\r\nlarger groups into more and more numerous, and more and more delicate,\r\nramifications of characters distinctive only of smaller and smaller\r\ngroups. A man would be deemed insane if he were to attribute the origin\r\nof every branch and every twig of a real tree to a separate act of\r\nspecial creation; and although we have not been able to witness the\r\ngrowth of what we may term in a new sense the Tree of Life, the\r\nstructural relations which are now apparent between its innumerable\r\nramifications bear quite as strong a testimony to the fact of their\r\nhaving been due to an organic growth, as is the testimony furnished by\r\nthe branches of an actual tree.\r\n\r\nOr, to take another illustration. Classification of organic forms, as\r\nDarwin, Lyell, and Haeckel have pointed out, strongly resembles the\r\nclassification of languages. In the case of languages, as in the case of\r\nspecies, we have genetic affinities strongly marked; so that it is\r\npossible to some extent to construct a Language-tree, the branches of\r\nwhich shall indicate, in a diagrammatic form, the progressive divergence\r\nof a large group of languages from a common stock. For instance, Latin\r\nmay be regarded as a fossil language, which has given rise to a group of\r\nliving languages--Italian, Spanish, French, and, to a large extent,\r\nEnglish. Now what would be thought of a philologist who should maintain\r\nthat English, French, Spanish, and Italian were all specially created\r\nlanguages--or languages separately constructed by the Deity, and by as\r\nmany separate acts of inspiration communicated to the nations which now\r\nspeak them--and that their resemblance to the fossil form, Latin, must\r\nbe attributed to special design? Yet the evidence of the natural\r\ntransmutation of species is in one respect much stronger than that of\r\nthe natural transmutation of languages--in respect, namely, of there\r\nbeing a vastly greater number of cases all bearing testimony to the fact\r\nof genetic relationship.\r\n\r\nBut, quitting now this most general point of view--or the suggestive\r\nfact that what we have before us is a _tree_--let us next approach this\r\ntree for the purpose of examining its structure more in detail. When we\r\ndo this, the fact of next greatest generality which we find is as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nIn cases where a very old form of life has continued to exist\r\nunmodified, so that by investigation of its anatomy we are brought back\r\nto a more primitive type of structure than that of the newer forms\r\ngrowing higher up _upon the same branch_, two things are observable. In\r\nthe first place, the old form is less differentiated than the newer\r\nones; and, in the next place, it is seen much more closely to resemble\r\ntypes of structure belonging to some of the other and larger branches of\r\nthe tree. The organization of the older form is not only _simpler_; but\r\nit is, as naturalists say, more _generalized_. It comprises within\r\nitself characters belonging to its own branch, and also characters\r\nbelonging to neighbouring branches, or to the trunk from which allied\r\nbranches spring. Hence it becomes a general rule of classification, that\r\nit is by the lowest, or by the oldest, forms of any two natural groups\r\nthat the affinities between the two groups admit of being best detected.\r\nAnd it is obvious that this is just what ought to be the case on the\r\ntheory of descent with divergent modification; while, upon the\r\nalternative theory of special creation, no reason can be assigned why\r\nthe lowest or the oldest types should thus combine the characters which\r\nafterwards become severally distinctive of higher or newer types.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have already alluded to the remarkable fact that there is no\r\ncorrelation between the value of structures to the organisms which\r\npresent them, and their value to the naturalist for the purpose of\r\ntracing natural affinity; and I have remarked that up to the close of\r\nthe last century it was regarded as an axiom of taxonomic science, that\r\nstructures which are of most importance to the animals or plants\r\npossessing them must likewise prove of most importance in any natural\r\nsystem of classification. On this account, all attempts to discover the\r\nnatural classification went upon the supposition that such a direct\r\nproportion must obtain--with the result that organs of most\r\nphysiological importance were chosen as the bases of systematic work.\r\nAnd when, in the earlier part of the present century, De Candolle found\r\nthat instead of a direct there was usually an inverse proportion between\r\nthe functional and the taxonomic value of a structure, he was unable to\r\nsuggest any reason for this apparently paradoxical fact. For, upon the\r\ntheory of special creation, no reason can be assigned why organs of\r\nleast importance to organisms should prove of most importance as marks\r\nof natural affinity. But on the theory of descent with progressive\r\nmodification the apparent paradox is at once explained. For it is\r\nevident that organs of functional importance are, other things equal,\r\nthe organs which are most likely to undergo different modifications in\r\ndifferent lines of family descent, and therefore in time to have their\r\ngenetic relationships in these different lines obscured. On the other\r\nhand, organs or structures which are of no functional importance are\r\nnever called upon to change in response to any change of habit, or to\r\nany change in the conditions of life. They may, therefore, continue to\r\nbe inherited through many different lines of family descent, and thus\r\nafford evidence of genetic relationship where such evidence fails to be\r\ngiven by any of the structures of vital importance, which in the course\r\nof many generations have been required to change in many ways according\r\nto the varied experiences of different branches of the same family.\r\nHere, then, we have an empirically discovered rule in the science of\r\nclassification, the _raison d'etre_ of which we are at once able to\r\nappreciate upon the theory of evolution, whereas no possible explanation\r\nof why it should ever have become a rule could be furnished upon the\r\ntheory of special creation.\r\n\r\nHere, again, is another empirically determined rule. The larger the\r\n_number_, as distinguished from the _importance_, of structures which\r\nare found common to different groups, the greater becomes their value as\r\nguides to the determination of natural affinity. Or, as Darwin puts it,\r\n\"the value of an aggregate of characters, even when none are important,\r\nalone explains the aphorism enunciated by Linnaeus, namely, that the\r\ncharacters do not give the genus, but the genus gives the characters;\r\nfor this seems founded on the appreciation of many trifling points of\r\nresemblance, too slight to be defined[1].\"\r\n\r\n    [1] _Origin of Species_, p. 367.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident, without comment, of how much value aggregates of\r\ncharacters ought to be in classification, if the ultimate meaning of\r\nclassification be that of tracing lines of pedigree; whereas, if this\r\nultimate meaning were that of tracing divine ideals manifested in\r\nspecial creation, we can see no reason why single characters are not\r\nsuch sure tokens of a natural arrangement as are aggregates of\r\ncharacters, even though the latter be in every other respect\r\nunimportant. For, on the special creation theory, we cannot explain why\r\nan assemblage, say of four or five trifling characters, should have been\r\nchosen to mark some unity of plan, rather than some one character of\r\nfunctional importance, which would have served at least equally well any\r\nsuch hypothetical purpose. On the other hand, as Darwin remarks, \"we\r\ncare not how trifling a character may be--let it be the mere inflection\r\nof the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded,\r\nwhether the skin be covered with hair or feathers--if it prevail\r\nthroughout many and different species, especially those having very\r\ndifferent habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for\r\nits presence in so many forms, with such different habits, only by\r\ninheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in regard\r\nto single points of structure, but when several characters, let them be\r\never so trifling, concur throughout a large group of beings having\r\ndifferent habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent,\r\nthat these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor; and\r\nwe know that such aggregated characters have especial value in\r\nclassification[2].\"\r\n\r\n    [2] _Origin of Species_, p. 372.\r\n\r\nIt is true that even a single character, if found common to a large\r\nnumber of forms, while uniformly absent from others, is also regarded by\r\nnaturalists as of importance for purposes of classification, although\r\nthey recognise it as of a value subordinate to that of aggregates of\r\ncharacters. But this also is what we should expect on the theory of\r\ndescent. If even any one structure be found to run through a number of\r\nanimals presenting different habits of life, the readiest explanation of\r\nthe fact is to be found in the theory of descent; but this does not\r\nhinder that if several such characters always occur together, the\r\ninference of genetic relationship is correspondingly confirmed. And the\r\nfact that before this inference was ever drawn, naturalists recognised\r\nthe value of single characters in proportion to their constancy, and the\r\nyet higher value of aggregates of characters in proportion to their\r\nnumber--this fact shows that in their work of classification naturalists\r\nempirically observed the effects of a cause which we have now\r\ndiscovered, to wit, hereditary transmission of characters through\r\never-widening groups of changing species.\r\n\r\nThere is another argument which appears to tell strongly in favour of\r\nthe theory of descent. We have just seen that non-adaptive structures,\r\nnot being required to change in response to change of habits or\r\nconditions of life, are allowed to persist unchanged through many\r\ngenerations, and thus furnish exceptionally good guides in the science\r\nof classification--or, according to our theory, in the work of tracing\r\nlines of pedigree. But now, the converse of this statement holds equally\r\ntrue. For it often happens that adaptive structures are required to\r\nchange in different lines of descent in analogous ways, in order to meet\r\nanalogous needs; and, when such is the case, the structures concerned\r\nhave to assume more or less close resemblances to one another, even\r\nthough they have severally descended from quite different ancestors. The\r\npaddles of a whale, for instance, most strikingly resemble the fins of a\r\nfish as to their outward form and movements; yet, on the theory of\r\ndescent, they must be held to have had a widely different parentage.\r\nNow, in all such cases where there is thus what is called an analogous\r\n(or adaptive) resemblance, as distinguished from what is called an\r\nhomologous (or anatomical) resemblance--in all such cases it is\r\nobservable that the similarities do not extend further into the\r\nstructure of the parts than it is necessary that they should extend, in\r\norder that the structures should both perform the same functions. The\r\nwhole anatomy of the paddles of a whale is quite unlike that of the fins\r\nof a fish--being, in fact, that of the fore-limb of a mammal. The\r\nchange, therefore, which the fore-limb has here undergone to suit it to\r\nthe aquatic habits of this mammal, is no greater than was required for\r\nthat purpose: the change has not extended to any one feature of\r\n_anatomical_ significance. This, of course, is what we should expect on\r\nthe theory of descent with modification of ancestral characters; but on\r\nthe theory of special creation it is not intelligible why there should\r\nalways be so marked a distinction between resemblances as analogical or\r\nadaptive, and resemblances as homological or of meaning in reference to\r\na natural classification. To take another and more detailed instance,\r\nthe Tasmanian wolf is an animal separated from true wolves in a natural\r\nsystem of classification. Yet its jaws and teeth bear a strong general\r\nresemblance to those of all the dog tribe, although there are\r\ndifferences of anatomical detail. In particular, while the dogs all have\r\non each side of the upper jaw four pre-molars and two molars, the\r\nTasmanian wolf has three pre-molars and four molars. Now there is no\r\nreason, so far as their common function of dealing with flesh is\r\nconcerned, why the teeth of the Tasmanian wolf should not have resembled\r\nhomologically as well as analogically the teeth of a true wolf; and\r\ntherefore we cannot assign any intelligible reason why, if all the\r\nspecies of the dog genus were separately created with one pattern of\r\nteeth, the unallied Tasmanian wolf should have been furnished with what\r\nis practically the same pattern from a functional point of view, while\r\ndiffering from a structural point of view. But, of course, on the theory\r\nof descent with modification, we can well understand why similarities of\r\nhabit should have led to similarities of structural appearance of an\r\nadaptive kind in different lines of descent, without there being any\r\ntrace of such real or anatomical similarities as could possibly point to\r\ngenetic relationship.\r\n\r\nLastly, to adduce the only remaining argument from classification which\r\nI regard as of any considerable weight, naturalists have found it\r\nnecessary, while constructing their natural classifications, to set\r\ngreat store on what Mr. Darwin calls \"chains of affinities.\" Thus, for\r\ninstance, \"nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters\r\ncommon to all birds; but with crustaceans any such definition has\r\nhitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans at the opposite\r\nends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the\r\nspecies at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to\r\nothers, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to\r\nthis, and to no other class of the articulata[3].\" Now it is evident\r\nthat this progressive modification of specific types--where it cannot be\r\nsaid that the continuity of resemblance is anywhere broken, and yet\r\nterminates in modification so great that but for the connecting links no\r\none could divine a natural relationship between the extreme members of\r\nthe series,--it is evident that such chains of affinity speak most\r\nstrongly in favour of a transmutation of the species concerned, while it\r\nis impossible to suggest any explanation of the fact in terms of the\r\nrival theory. For if all the links of such a chain were separately\r\nforged by as many acts of special creation, we can see no reason why B\r\nshould resemble A, C resemble B, and so on, but with ever slight though\r\naccumulating differences, until there is no resemblance at all between A\r\nand Z.\r\n\r\n    [3] _Origin of Species_, pp. 368-9.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hope enough has now been said to show that all the general principles\r\nand particular facts appertaining to the natural classification of\r\nplants and animals, are precisely what they ought to be according to the\r\ntheory of genetic descent; while no one of them is such as might\r\nbe--and, indeed, used to be--expected upon the theory of special\r\ncreation. Therefore, the only possible way in which all this uniform\r\nbody of direct evidence can be met by a supporter of the latter theory,\r\nis by falling back upon the argument from ignorance. We do not know, it\r\nmay be said, what hidden reasons there may have been for following all\r\nthese general principles in the separate creation of specific types.\r\nNow, it is evident that this is a form of argument which admits of being\r\nbrought against all the actual--and even all the possible--lines of\r\nevidence in favour of evolution. Therefore I deem it desirable thus\r\nearly in our proceedings to place this argument from ignorance on its\r\nproper logical footing.\r\n\r\nIf there were any independent evidence in favour of special creation as\r\na _fact_, then indeed the argument from ignorance might be fairly used\r\nagainst any sceptical cavils regarding the _method_. In this way, for\r\nexample, Bishop Butler made a legitimate use of the argument from\r\nignorance when he urged that it is no reasonable objection against a\r\nrevelation, _otherwise accredited_, to show that it has been rendered in\r\na form, or after a method, which we should not have antecedently\r\nexpected. But he could not have legitimately employed this argument,\r\nexcept on the supposition that he had some independent evidence in\r\nfavour of the revelation; for, in the absence of any such independent\r\nevidence, appeal to the argument from ignorance would have become a mere\r\nbegging of the question, by simply assuming that a revelation had been\r\nmade. And thus it is in the present case. A man, of course, may quite\r\nlegitimately say, _Assuming that the theory of special creation is\r\ntrue_, it is not for us to anticipate the form or method of the\r\nprocess. But where the question is as to whether or not the theory _is_\r\ntrue, it becomes a mere begging of this question to take refuge in the\r\nargument from ignorance, or to represent in effect that there is no\r\nquestion to be discussed. And if, when the form or method is\r\ninvestigated, it be found everywhere charged with evidence in favour of\r\nthe theory of descent, the case becomes the same as that of a supposed\r\nrevelation, which has been discredited by finding that all available\r\nevidence points to a natural growth. In short, the argument from\r\nignorance is in any case available only as a negative foil against\r\ndestructive criticism: in no case has it any positive value, or value of\r\na constructive kind. Therefore, if a theory on any subject is destitute\r\nof positive evidence, while some alternative theory is in possession of\r\nsuch evidence, the argument from ignorance can be of no logical use to\r\nthe former, even though it maybe of such use to the latter. For it is\r\nonly the possession of positive evidence which can furnish a logical\r\njustification of the argument from ignorance: in the absence of such\r\nevidence, even the negative value of the argument disappears, and it\r\nthen implies nothing more than the gratuitous assumption of a theory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will now sum up the various considerations which have occupied us\r\nduring the present chapter.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we must take note that the classification of plants and\r\nanimals in groups subordinate to groups is not merely arbitrary, or\r\nundertaken only for a matter of convenience and nomenclature--such, for\r\ninstance, as the classification of stars in constellations. On the\r\ncontrary, the classification of a naturalist differs from that of an\r\nastronomer, in that the objects which he has to classify present\r\nstructural resemblances and structural differences in numberless\r\ndegrees; and it is the object of his classification to present a tabular\r\nstatement of these facts. Now, long before the theory of evolution was\r\nentertained, naturalists became fully aware that these facts of\r\nstructural resemblances running through groups subordinate to groups\r\nwere really facts of nature, and not merely poetic imaginations of the\r\nmind. No one could dissect a number of fishes without perceiving that\r\nthey were all constructed on one anatomical pattern, which differed\r\nconsiderably from the equally uniform pattern on which all mammals were\r\nconstructed, even although some mammals bore an extraordinary\r\nresemblance to fish in external form and habits of life. And similarly\r\nwith all the smaller divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\nEverywhere investigation revealed the bonds of close structural\r\nresemblances between species of the same genus, resemblance less close\r\nbetween genera of the same family, resemblance still less close between\r\nfamilies of the same order, resemblance yet more remote between orders\r\nof the same class, and resemblance only in fundamental features between\r\nclasses of the same sub-kingdom, beyond which limit all anatomical\r\nresemblance was found to disappear--the different sub-kingdoms being\r\nformed on wholly different patterns. Furthermore, in tracing all these\r\ngrades of structural relationship, naturalists were slowly led to\r\nrecognise that the form which a natural classification must eventually\r\nassume would be that of a tree, wherein the constituent branches would\r\ndisplay a progressive advance of organization from below upwards.\r\n\r\nNow we have seen that although this tree-like arrangement of natural\r\ngroups was as suggestive as anything could well be of all the forms oL\r\nlife being bound together by the ties of genetic relationship, such was\r\nnot the inference which was drawn from it. Dominated by the theory of\r\nspecial creation, naturalists either regarded the resemblance of type\r\nsubordinate to type as expressive of divine ideals manifested in such\r\ncreation, or else contented themselves with investigating the facts\r\nwithout venturing to speculate upon their philosophical import. But even\r\nthose naturalists who abstained from committing themselves to any theory\r\nof archetypal plans, did not doubt that facts so innumerable and so\r\nuniversal must have been due to some one co-ordinating principle--that,\r\neven though they were not able to suggest what it was, there must have\r\nbeen some hidden bond of connexion running through the whole of organic\r\nnature. Now, as we have seen, it is manifest to evolutionists that this\r\nhidden bond can be nothing else than heredity; and, therefore, that\r\nthese earlier naturalists, although they did not know what they were\r\ndoing, were really tracing the lines of genetic descent as revealed by\r\ndegrees of structural resemblance,--that the arborescent grouping of\r\norganic forms which their labours led them to begin, and in large\r\nmeasure to execute, was in fact a family tree of life.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the substance of the argument from classification. The\r\nmere fact that all organic nature thus incontestably lends itself to a\r\nnatural arrangement of group subordinate to group, when due regard is\r\npaid to degrees of anatomical resemblance--this mere fact of itself\r\ntells so weightily in favour of descent with progressive modification in\r\ndifferent lines, that even if it stood alone it would be entitled to\r\nrank as one of our strongest pieces of evidence. But, as we have seen,\r\nit does not stand alone. When we look beyond this large and general fact\r\nof all the innumerable forms of life being thus united in a tree-like\r\nsystem by an unquestionable relationship of some kind, to those smaller\r\ndetails in the science of classification which have been found most\r\nuseful as guides for this kind of research, then we find that all these\r\ndetails, or empirically discovered rules, are exactly what we should\r\nhave expected them to be, supposing the real meaning of classification\r\nto have been that of tracing lines of pedigree.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we have seen that the most archaic types are both simpler\r\nin their organization and more generalized in their characters than are\r\nthe more recent types--a fact of which no explanation can be given on\r\nthe theory of special creation. But, upon the theory of natural\r\nevolution, we can without difficulty understand why the earlier forms\r\nshould have been the simpler forms, and also why they should have been\r\nthe most generalized. For it is out of the older forms that the newer\r\nmust have grown; and, as they multiplied, they must have become more and\r\nmore differentiated.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have seen that there is no correlation between the importance\r\nof any structure from a classificatory point of view, and the importance\r\nof that structure to the organism which presents it. On the contrary,\r\nit is a general rule that \"the less any part of the organization is\r\nconcerned with special habits, the more important it becomes for\r\nclassification.\" Now, from the point of view of special creation it is\r\nunintelligible why unity of ideal should be most manifested by least\r\nimportant structures, whereas from the point of view of evolution it is\r\nto be expected that these life-serving structures should have been most\r\nliable to divergent modification in divergent lines of descent, or in\r\nadaptation to different conditions of life, while the trivial or less\r\nimportant characters should have been allowed to remain unmodified. Thus\r\nwe can now understand why all primitive classifications were wrong in\r\nprinciple when they went upon the assumption that divine ideals were\r\nbest exhibited by resemblances between life-serving (and therefore\r\nadaptive) structures, with the result that whales were classed with\r\nfishes, birds with bats, and so on. Nevertheless, these primitive\r\nnaturalists were quite logical; for, from the premises furnished by the\r\ntheory of special creation, it is much more reasonable to expect that\r\nunity of ideal should be shown in plainly adaptive characters than in\r\ntrivial and more or less hidden anatomical characters. Moreover, long\r\nafter biological science had ceased consciously to follow any\r\ntheological theory, the apparent axiom continued to be entertained, that\r\nstructures of most importance to organisms must also be structures of\r\nmost importance to systematists. And when at last, in the present\r\ncentury, this was found not to be the case, no reason could be suggested\r\nwhy it was not the case. But now we are able fully to explain this\r\napparent anomaly.\r\n\r\nOnce more, we have seen that aggregates of characters presenting\r\nresemblances to one another have always been found to be of special\r\nimportance as guides to classification. This, of course, is what we\r\nshould have expected, if the real meaning of classification be that of\r\ntracing lines of pedigree; but on the theory of special creation no\r\nreason can be assigned why single characters are not such sure tokens of\r\na natural arrangement as are aggregates of characters, however trivial\r\nthe latter may be. For it is obvious that unity of ideal might have been\r\neven better displayed by everywhere maintaining the pattern of some one\r\nimportant structure, than by doing so in the case of several unimportant\r\nstructures. Take an analogous instance from human contrivances. Unity of\r\nideal in the case of gun-making would be shown by the same principles of\r\nmechanism running through all the different sizes and shapes of\r\ngun-locks, rather than by the ornamental patterns engraved upon the\r\noutside. Yet it must be supposed that in the mechanisms assumed to have\r\nbeen constructed by special creation, it was the trivial details rather\r\nthan the fundamental principles of these mechanisms which were chosen by\r\nthe Divinity to display his ideals.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads us to the next consideration--namely, that when in two\r\ndifferent lines of descent animals happen to adopt similar habits of\r\nlife, the modifications which they undergo in order to fit them for\r\nthese habits often induces striking resemblances of structure between\r\nthe two animals, as in the case of whales and fish. But in all such\r\ninstances it is invariably found that the resemblance is only\r\nsuperficial and apparent: not anatomical or real. In other words, the\r\nresemblance does not extend further than it is necessary that it\r\nshould, if both sets of organs are to be adapted to perform the same\r\nfunctions. Now this, again, is just what one would expect to find as the\r\nuniversal rule on the theory of descent, with modification of ancestral\r\ncharacters. But, on the opposite theory of special creation, I know not\r\nhow it is to be explained that among so many instances of close\r\nsuperficial resemblance between creatures belonging to different\r\nbranches of the tree of life, there are no instances of any real or\r\nanatomical resemblance. So far as their structures are adapted to\r\nperform a common function, there is in all such cases what may be termed\r\na deceptive appearance of some unity of ideal; but, when carefully\r\nexamined, it is always found that two apparently identical structures\r\noccurring on different branches of the classificatory tree are in fact\r\nfundamentally different in respect of their structural plan.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have seen that one of the guiding principles of\r\nclassification has been empirically found to consist in setting a high\r\nvalue on \"chains of affinities.\" That is to say, naturalists not\r\nunfrequently meet with a long series of progressive modifications of\r\ntype, which, although it cannot be said that the continuity is anywhere\r\nbroken, at last leads to so much divergence of character that, but for\r\nthe intermediate links, the members at each end of the chain could not\r\nbe suspected of being in any way related. Well, such cases of chains of\r\naffinity obviously tell most strongly in favour of descent with\r\ncontinuous modification; while it is impossible to suggest why, if all\r\nthe links were separately forged by as many acts of special creation,\r\nthere should have been this gradual transmutation of characters carried\r\nto the point where the original creative ideal has been so completely\r\ntransformed that, but for the accident of the chain being still\r\ncomplete, no one of nature's interpreters could possibly have discovered\r\nthe connexion. For, as we have seen, this is not a case in which any\r\nappeal can be logically made to the argument from ignorance of divine\r\nmethod, unless some independent evidence could be adduced in favour of\r\nspecial creation. And that no such independent evidence exists, it will\r\nbe the object of future chapters to show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMORPHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of evolution supposes that hereditary characters admit of\r\nbeing slowly modified wherever their modification will render an\r\norganism better suited to a change in its conditions of life. Let us,\r\nthen, observe the evidence which we have of such adaptive modifications\r\nof structure, in cases where the need of such modification is apparent.\r\nWe may begin by again taking the case of the whales and porpoises. The\r\ntheory of evolution infers, from the whole structure of these animals,\r\nthat their progenitors must have been terrestrial quadrupeds of some\r\nkind, which gradually became more and more aquatic in their habits. Now\r\nthe change in the conditions of their life thus brought about would have\r\nrendered desirable great modifications of structure. These changes would\r\nhave begun by affecting the least typical--that is, the least strongly\r\ninherited--structures, such as the skin, claws, and teeth. But, as time\r\nwent on, the adaptation would have extended to more typical structures,\r\nuntil the shape of the body would have become affected by the bones and\r\nmuscles required for terrestrial locomotion becoming better adapted for\r\naquatic locomotion, and the whole outline of the animal more fish-like\r\nin shape. This is the stage which we actually observe in the seals,\r\nwhere the hind legs, although retaining all their typical bones, have\r\nbecome shortened up almost to rudiments, and directed backwards, so as\r\nto be of no use for walking, while serving to complete the fish-like\r\ntaper of the body. (Fig. 2.) But in the whales the modification has gone\r\nfurther than this so that the hind legs have ceased to be apparent\r\nexternally, and are only represented internally--and even this only in\r\nsome species--by remnants so rudimentary that it is difficult to make\r\nout with certainty the homologies of the bones; moreover, the head and\r\nthe whole body have become completely fish-like in shape. (Fig. 3.) But\r\nprofound as are these alterations, they affect only those parts of the\r\norganism which it was for the benefit of the organism to have altered,\r\nso that it might be adapted to an aquatic mode of existence. Thus the\r\narm, which is used as a fin, still retains the bones of the shoulder,\r\nfore-arm, wrist, and fingers, although they are all enclosed in a\r\nfin-shaped sack, so as to render them useless for any purpose other than\r\nswimming (Fig. 4.) Similarly, the head, although it so closely resembles\r\nthe head of a fish in shape, still retains the bones of the mammalian\r\nskull in their proper anatomical relations to one another; but modified\r\nin form so as to offer the least possible resistance to the water. In\r\nshort, it may be said that all the modifications have been effected with\r\nthe least possible divergence from the typical mammalian type, which is\r\ncompatible with securing so perfect an adaptation to a purely aquatic\r\nmode of life.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Skeleton of Seal, 1/8 nat. size.

The rudimentary bones of the pelvis are shown on a larger\r\n    scale in the upper drawing. (From Prof. Flower.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Paddle of Whale compared with Hand of Man.\r\n    Drawn from nature (_R. Coll. Surg. Mus._).]\r\n\r\nNow I have chosen the case of the whale and porpoise group, because they\r\noffer so extreme an example of profound modification of structure in\r\nadaptation to changed conditions of life. But the same thing may be seen\r\nin hundreds and hundreds of other cases. For instance, to confine our\r\nattention to the arm, not only is the limb modified in the whale for\r\nswimming, but in another mammal--the bat--it is modified for flying, by\r\nhaving the fingers enormously elongated and overspread with a membranous\r\nweb.\r\n\r\nIn birds, again, the arm is modified for flight in a wholly different\r\nway--the fingers here being very short and all run together, while the\r\nchief expanse of the wing is composed of the shoulder and fore-arm. In\r\nfrogs and lizards, again, we find hands more like our own; but in an\r\nextinct species of flying reptile the modification was extreme, the wing\r\nhaving been formed by a prodigious elongation of the fifth finger, and a\r\nmembrane spread over it and the rest of the hand. (Fig. 5.) Lastly, in\r\nserpents the hand and arm have disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Wing of Reptile, Mammal, and Bird. Drawn\r\n    from nature (_Brit. Mus._).]\r\n\r\nThus, even if we confine our attention to a single organ, how wonderful\r\nare the modifications which it is seen to undergo, although never losing\r\nits typical character. Everywhere we find the distinction between\r\nhomology and analogy which was explained in the last chapter--the\r\ndistinction, that is, between correspondence of structure and\r\ncorrespondence of function. On the one hand, we meet with structures\r\nwhich are perfectly homologous and yet in no way analogous: the\r\nstructural elements remain, but are profoundly modified so as to perform\r\nwholly different functions. On the other hand, we meet with structures\r\nwhich are perfectly analogous, and yet in no way homologous: totally\r\ndifferent structures are modified to perform the same functions. How,\r\nthen, are we to explain these things? By design manifested in special\r\ncreation, or by descent with adaptive modification? If it is said by\r\ndesign manifested in special creation, we must suppose that the Deity\r\nformed an archetypal plan of certain structures, and that he determined\r\nto adhere to this plan through all the modifications which those\r\nstructures exhibit. But, if so, why is it that some structures are\r\nselected as typical and not others? Why should the vertebral skeleton,\r\nfor instance, be tortured into every conceivable variety of modification\r\nin order to subserve as great a variety of functions; while another\r\nstructure, such as the eye, is made in different sub-kingdoms on\r\nfundamentally different plans, notwithstanding that it has throughout to\r\nperform the same function? Will any one have the hardihood to assert\r\nthat in the case of the skeleton the Deity has endeavoured to show his\r\n_ingenuity_, by the manifold functions to which he has made the same\r\nstructure subservient; while in the case of the eye he has endeavoured\r\nto show his _resources_, by the manifold structures which he has adapted\r\nto serve the same function? If so, it becomes a most unfortunate\r\ncircumstance that, throughout both the vegetable and animal kingdoms,\r\nall cases which can be pointed to as showing ingenious adaptation of the\r\nsame typical structure to the performance of widely different\r\nfunctions--or cases of homology without analogy,--are cases which come\r\nwithin the limits of the same natural group of plants and animals, and\r\ntherefore admit of being equally well explained by descent from a common\r\nancestry; while all cases of widely different structures performing the\r\nsame function--or cases of analogy without homology,--are to be found in\r\ndifferent groups of plants or animals, and are therefore suggestive of\r\nindependent variations arising in the different lines of hereditary\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nTo take a specific illustration. The octopus, or devil-fish, belongs to\r\na widely different class of animals from a true fish; and yet its eye,\r\nin general appearance, looks wonderfully like the eye of a true fish.\r\nNow, Mr. Mivart pointed to this fact as a great difficulty in the way of\r\nthe theory of evolution by natural selection, because it must clearly be\r\na most improbable thing that so complicated a structure as the eye of a\r\nfish should happen to be arrived at through each of two totally\r\ndifferent lines of descent. And this difficulty would, indeed, be a\r\nformidable one to the theory of evolution, if the similarity were not\r\nonly analogical but homological. Unfortunately for the objection,\r\nhowever, Darwin clearly showed in his reply that in no one anatomical or\r\nhomologous feature do the two structures resemble one another; so that,\r\nin point of fact, the two organs do not resemble one another in any\r\nparticular further than it is necessary that they should, if both are to\r\nbe analogous, or to serve the same function as organs of sight. But now,\r\nsuppose that this had not been the case, and that the two structures,\r\nbesides presenting the necessary superficial or analogical resemblance,\r\nhad also presented an anatomical or homologous resemblance, with what\r\nforce might it have then been urged,--Your hypothesis of hereditary\r\ndescent with progressive modification being here excluded by the fact\r\nthat the animals compared belong to two widely different branches of the\r\ntree of life, how are we to explain the identity of type manifested by\r\nthese two complicated organs of vision? The only hypothesis open to us\r\nis intelligent adherence to an ideal plan or mechanism. But as this\r\ncannot now be urged in any comparable case throughout the whole organic\r\nworld, we may on the other hand present it as a most significant fact,\r\nthat while within the limits of the same large branch of the tree of\r\nlife we constantly find the same typical structures modified so as to\r\nperform very different functions, we never find any of these particular\r\ntypes of structure in other large branches of the tree. That is to say,\r\nwe never find typical structures appearing except in cases where their\r\npresence may be explained by the hypothesis of hereditary descent; while\r\nin thousands of such cases we find these structures undergoing every\r\nconceivable variety of adaptive modification.\r\n\r\nConsequently, special creationists must fall back upon another position\r\nand say,--Well, but it may have pleased the Deity to form a certain\r\nnumber of ideal types, and never to have allowed the structures\r\noccurring in one type to appear in any of the others. We\r\nanswer,--Undoubtedly such may have been the case; but, if so, it is a\r\nmost unfortunate thing for your theory, because the fact implies that\r\nthe Deity has planned his types in such a way as to suggest the\r\ncounter-theory of descent. For instance, it would seem most capricious\r\non the part of the Deity to have made the eyes of an innumerable number\r\nof fish on exactly the same ideal type, and then to have made the eye of\r\nthe octopus so exactly like these other eyes in superficial appearance\r\nas to deceive so accomplished a naturalist as Mr. Mivart, and yet to\r\nhave taken scrupulous care that in no one ideal particular should the\r\none type resemble the other. However, adopting for the sake of argument\r\nthis great assumption, let us suppose that God did lay down these\r\narbitrary rules for his own guidance in creation, and then let us see to\r\nwhat the assumption leads. If the Deity formed a certain number of ideal\r\ntypes, and determined that on no account should he allow any part of one\r\ntype to appear in any part of another, surely we should expect that\r\nwithin the limits of the same type the same typical structures should\r\nalways be present. Thus, remember what efforts, so to speak, have been\r\nmade to maintain the uniformity of type in the case of the fore-limb as\r\npreviously explained, and should we not expect that in other and similar\r\ncases a similar method should have been followed? Yet we repeatedly find\r\nthat this is not the case. Even in the whale, as we have seen, the\r\nhind-limbs are either altogether absent or dwindled almost to nothing;\r\nand it is impossible to see in what respect the hind-limbs are of any\r\nless ideal value than the fore-limbs--which are carefully preserved in\r\nall vertebrated animals except the snakes, and the extinct _Dinornis_,\r\nwhere again we meet in this particular with a sudden and sublime\r\nindifference to the maintenance of a typical structure. (Fig. 6.)[4] Now\r\nI say that if the theory of ideal types is true, we have in these facts\r\nevidence of a most unreasonable inconsistency. But the theory of descent\r\nwith continued adaptive modification fully explains all the known cases;\r\nfor in every case the degree of divergence from the typical structure\r\nwhich an organism presents corresponds, in a general way, with the\r\nlength of time during which the divergence has been going on. Thus we\r\nscarcely ever meet with any great departure from the typical form with\r\nrespect to one of the organs, without some of the other organs being so\r\nfar modified as of themselves to indicate, on the supposition of\r\ndescent with modification, that the animal or plant must have been\r\nsubject to the modifying influences for an enormously long series of\r\ngenerations. And this combined testimony of a number of organs in the\r\nsame organism is what the theory of descent would lead us to expect,\r\nwhile the rival theory of design can offer no explanation of the fact,\r\nthat when one organ shows a conspicuous departure from the supposed\r\nideal type, some of the other organs in the same organism should tend to\r\nkeep it company by doing likewise.\r\n\r\n    [4] It is, however, probable that all species of the genus retained\r\n    a tiny rudiment of wings in greatly dwindled scapulo-coracoid bones.\r\n    And Mr. H. O. Forbes has detected, in a recently exhumed specimen of\r\n    the latter, an indication of the glenoid cavity, for the\r\n    articulation of an extremely aborted humerus. (See _Nature_, Jan.\r\n    14th, 1892.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Skeleton of _Dinornis gravis_, 1/16 nat.\r\n    size. Drawn from nature (_Brit. Mus._). As separate cuts on a larger\r\n    scale are shown, 1st, the sternum, as this appears in mounted\r\n    skeletons, and, 2nd, the same in profile, with its (hypothetical)\r\n    scapulo-coracoid attached.]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration both of this and of other points which have been\r\nmentioned, I may draw attention to what seems to me a particularly\r\nsuggestive case. So-called soldier-or hermit-crabs, are crabs which have\r\nadopted the habit of appropriating the empty shells of mollusks. In\r\nassociation with this peculiar habit, the structure of these animals\r\ndiffers very greatly from that of all other crabs. In particular, the\r\nhinder part of the body, which occupies the mollusk-shell, and which\r\ntherefore has ceased to require any hard covering of its own, has been\r\nsuffered to lose its calcareous integument, and presents a soft fleshy\r\ncharacter, quite unlike that of the more exposed parts of the animal.\r\nMoreover, this soft fleshy part of the creature is specially adapted to\r\nthe particular requirements of the creature by having its lateral\r\nappendages--i. e. appendages which in other crustacea perform the\r\nfunction of legs--modified so as to act as claspers to the inside of the\r\nmollusk-shell; while the tail-end of the part in question is twisted\r\ninto the form of a spiral, which fits into the spiral of the\r\nmollusk-shell. Now, in Keeling Island there is a large kind of crab\r\ncalled _Birgus latro_, which lives upon land and there feeds upon\r\ncocoa-nuts. The whole structure of this crab, it seems to me,\r\nunmistakeably resembles the structure of a hermit-crab (see drawings on\r\nthe next page, Fig. 7). Yet this crab neither lives in the shell of a\r\nmollusk, nor is the hinder part of its body in the soft and fleshy\r\ncondition just described: on the contrary, it is covered with a hard\r\nintegument like all the other parts of the animal. Consequently, I think\r\nwe may infer that the ancestors of _Birgus_ were hermit-crabs living in\r\nmollusk-shells; but that their descendants gradually relinquished this\r\nhabit as they gradually became more and more terrestrial, while,\r\nconcurrently with these changes in habit, the originally soft posterior\r\nparts acquired a hard protective covering to take the place of that\r\nwhich was formerly supplied by the mollusk-shell. So that, if so, we now\r\nhave, within the limits of a single organism, evidence of a whole series\r\nof morphological changes in the past history of its species. First,\r\nthere must have been the great change from an ordinary crab to a\r\nhermit-crab in all the respects previously pointed out. Next, there must\r\nhave been the change back again from a hermit-crab to an ordinary crab,\r\nso far as living without the necessity of a mollusk-shell is concerned.\r\nFrom an evolutionary point of view, therefore, we appear to have in the\r\nexisting structure of _Birgus_ a morphological record of all these\r\nchanges, and one which gives us a reasonable explanation of why the\r\nanimal presents the extraordinary appearance which it does. But, on the\r\ntheory of special creation, it is inexplicable why this land-crab should\r\nhave been formed on the pattern of a hermit-crab, when it never has need\r\nto enter the shell of a mollusk. In other words, its peculiar\r\nstructure is not specially in keeping with its present habits, although\r\nso curiously allied to the similar structure of certain other crabs of\r\ntotally different habits, in relation to which the peculiarities are of\r\nplain and obvious significance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Hermit-crabs compared with the cocoa-nut\r\n    crab. On the left of the illustration one hermit-crab is represented\r\n    as occupying a mollusk-shell, and another (larger specimen) as it\r\n    appears when withdrawn from such a shell. On the right of the\r\n    illustration the cocoa-nut crab is represented in its natural\r\n    habitat on land. When full-grown, however, it is much larger than\r\n    our hermit-crabs. The latter are drawn from life, natural size, the\r\n    former from a specimen in the British Museum, 1/6 natural size.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will devote the remainder of this chapter to considering another\r\nbranch of the argument from morphology, to which the case of _Birgus_\r\nserves as a suitable introduction: I mean the argument from rudimentary\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nThroughout both the animal and vegetable kingdoms we constantly meet\r\nwith dwarfed and useless representatives of organs, which in other and\r\nallied kinds of animals and plants are of large size and functional\r\nutility. Thus, for instance, the unborn whale has rudimentary teeth,\r\nwhich are never destined to cut the gums; and throughout its life this\r\nanimal retains, in a similarly rudimentary condition, a number of organs\r\nwhich never could have been of use to any kind of creature save a\r\nterrestrial quadruped. The whole anatomy of its internal ear, for\r\nexample, has reference to hearing in air--or, as Hunter long ago\r\nremarked, \"is constructed upon the same principle as in the quadruped\";\r\nyet, as Owen says, \"the outer opening and passage leading therefrom to\r\nthe tympanum can rarely be affected by sonorous vibrations of the\r\natmosphere, and indeed they are reduced, or have degenerated, to a\r\ndegree which makes it difficult to conceive how such vibrations can be\r\npropagated to the ear-drum during the brief moments in which the opening\r\nmay be raised above the water.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Rudimentary or vestigial hind-limbs of\r\n    Python, as exhibited in the skeleton and on the external surface of\r\n    the animal. Drawn from nature, 1/4 nat. size (_Zoological\r\n    Gardens_).]\r\n\r\nNow, rudimentary organs of this kind are of such frequent occurrence,\r\nthat almost every species presents one or more of them--usually, indeed,\r\na considerable number. How, then, are they to be accounted for? of\r\ncourse the theory of descent with adaptive modification has a simple\r\nanswer to supply--namely, that when, from changed conditions of life, an\r\norgan which was previously useful becomes useless, it will be suffered\r\nto dwindle away in successive generations, under the influence of\r\ncertain natural causes which we shall have to consider in future\r\nchapters. On the other hand, the theory of special creation can only\r\nmaintain that these rudiments are formed for the sake of adhering to an\r\nideal type. Now, here again the former theory appears to be triumphant\r\nover the latter; for, without waiting to dispute the wisdom of making\r\ndwarfed and useless structures merely for the whimsical motive assigned,\r\nsurely if such a method were adopted in so many cases, we should expect\r\nthat in consistency it would be adopted in all cases. This reasonable\r\nexpectation, however, is far from being realized. We have already seen\r\nthat in numberless cases, such as that of the fore-limbs of serpents, no\r\nvestige of a rudiment is present. But the vacillating policy in the\r\nmatter of rudiments does not end here; for it is shown in a still more\r\naggravated form where within the limits of the same natural group of\r\norganisms a rudiment is sometimes present and sometimes absent. For\r\ninstance, although in nearly all the numerous species of snakes there\r\nare no vestiges of limbs, in the python we find very tiny rudiments of\r\nthe hind-limbs. (Fig. 8.) Now, is it a worthy conception of deity that,\r\nwhile neglecting to maintain his unity of ideal in the case of nearly\r\nall the numerous species of snakes, he should have added a tiny rudiment\r\nin the case of the python--and even in that case should have maintained\r\nhis ideal very inefficiently, inasmuch as only two limbs, instead of\r\nfour, are represented? how much more reasonable is the naturalistic\r\ninterpretation; for here the very irregularity of their appearance in\r\ndifferent species, which constitutes rudimentary structures one of the\r\ncrowning difficulties to the theory of special design, furnishes the\r\nbest possible evidence in favour of hereditary descent; seeing that this\r\nirregularity then becomes what may be termed the anticipated expression\r\nof progressive dwindling due to inutility. Thus, for example, to return\r\nto the case of wings, we have already seen that in an extinct genus of\r\nbird, _dinornis_, these organs were reduced to such an extent as to\r\nleave it still doubtful whether so much as the tiny rudiment\r\nhypothetically supplied to fig. 6 (p. 61) was present in all the\r\nspecies. And here is another well-known case of another genus of still\r\nexisting bird, which, as was the case with _dinornis_, occurs only in\r\nnew zealand. (Fig. 9.) Upon this island there are no four-footed\r\nenemies--either existing or extinct--to escape from which the wings of\r\nbirds would be of any service. Consequently we can understand why on\r\nthis island we should meet with such a remarkable dwindling away of\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--_Apteryx Australis._ Drawn from life in the\r\n    Zoological Gardens, 1/8 nat. size. The external wing is drawn to a\r\n    scale in the upper part of the cut. The surroundings are supplied\r\n    from the most recent descriptions.]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the logger-headed duck of South America can only flap along\r\nthe surface of the water, having its wings considerably reduced though\r\nless so than the _Apteryx_ of New Zealand. But here the interesting fact\r\nis that the young birds are able to fly perfectly well. Now, in\r\naccordance with a general law to be considered in a future chapter, the\r\nlife-history of an individual organism is a kind of condensed\r\nrecapitulation of the life-history of its species. Consequently, we can\r\nunderstand why the little chickens of the logger-headed duck are able to\r\nfly like all other ducks, while their parents are only able to flap\r\nalong the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nFacts analogous to this reduction of wings in birds which have no\r\nfurther use for them, are to be met with also in insects under similar\r\ncircumstances. Thus, there are on the island of Madeira somewhere\r\nbetween 500 and 600 species of beetles, which are in large part\r\npeculiar to that island, though related to other--and therefore\r\npresumably parent--species on the neighbouring continent. Now, no less\r\nthan 200 species--or nearly half the whole number--are so far deficient\r\nin wings that they cannot fly. And, if we disregard the species which\r\nare not peculiar to the island--that is to say, all the species which\r\nlikewise occur on the neighbouring continent, and therefore, as\r\nevolutionists conclude, have but _recently_ migrated to the island,--we\r\nfind this very remarkable proportion. There are altogether 29 peculiar\r\ngenera, and out of these no less than 23 have _all_ their species in\r\nthis condition.\r\n\r\nSimilar facts have been recently observed by the Rev. A. E. Eaton with\r\nrespect to insects inhabiting Kerguelen Island. All the species which he\r\nfound on the island--viz. a moth, several flies, and numerous\r\nbeetles--he found to be incapable of flight; and therefore, as Wallace\r\nobserves, \"as these insects could hardly have reached the islands in a\r\nwingless state, even if there were any other known land inhabited by\r\nthem, which there is not, we must assume that, like the Madeiran\r\ninsects, they were originally winged, and lost their power of flight\r\nbecause its possession was injurious to them\"--Kerguelen Island being\r\n\"one of the stormiest places on the globe,\" and therefore a place where\r\ninsects could rarely afford to fly without incurring the danger of being\r\nblown out to sea.\r\n\r\nHere is another and perhaps an even more suggestive class of facts.\r\n\r\nIt is now many years ago since the editors of _Silliman's Journal_\r\nrequested the late Professor Agassiz to give them his opinion on the\r\nfollowing question. In a certain dark subterranean cave, called the\r\nMammoth cave, there are found some peculiar species of blind fishes. Now\r\nthe editors of _Silliman's Journal_ wished to know whether Prof. Agassiz\r\nwould hold that these fish had been specially created in these caves,\r\nand purposely devoided of eyes which could never be of any use to them;\r\nor whether he would allow that these fish had probably descended from\r\nother species, but, having got into the dark cave, gradually lost their\r\neyes through disuse. Prof. Agassiz, who was a believer in special\r\ncreation, allowed that this ought to constitute a crucial test as\r\nbetween the two theories of special design and hereditary descent. \"If\r\nphysical circumstances,\" he said, \"ever modified organized beings, it\r\nshould be easily ascertained here.\" And eventually he gave it as his\r\nopinion, that these fish \"were created under the circumstances in which\r\nthey now live, within the limits over which they now range, and with the\r\nstructural peculiarities which now characterise them.\"\r\n\r\nSince then a great deal of attention has been paid to the fauna of this\r\nMammoth cave, and also to the faunas of other dark caverns, not only in\r\nthe New, but also in the Old World. In the result, the following general\r\nfacts have been fully established.\r\n\r\n(1) Not only fish, but many representatives of other classes, have been\r\nfound in dark caves.\r\n\r\n(2) Wherever the caves are totally dark, all the animals are blind.\r\n\r\n(3) If the animals live near enough to the entrance to receive some\r\ndegree of light, they may have large and lustrous eyes.\r\n\r\n(4) In all cases the species of blind animals are closely allied to\r\nspecies inhabiting the district where the caves occur; so that the blind\r\nspecies inhabiting American caves are closely allied to American\r\nspecies, while those inhabiting European caves are closely allied to\r\nEuropean species.\r\n\r\n(5) In nearly all cases structural remnants of eyes admit of being\r\ndetected, in various degrees of obsolescence. In the case of some of the\r\ncrustaceans of the Mammoth cave the foot-stalks of the eyes are present,\r\nalthough the eyes themselves are entirely absent.\r\n\r\nNow, it is evident that all these general facts are in full agreement\r\nwith the theory of evolution, while they offer serious difficulties to\r\nthe theory of special creation. As Darwin remarks, it is hard to imagine\r\nconditions of life more similar than those furnished by deep limestone\r\ncaverns under nearly the same climate in the two continents of America\r\nand Europe; so that, in accordance with the theory of special creation,\r\nvery close similarity in the organizations of the two sets of faunas\r\nmight have been expected. But, instead of this, the affinities of these\r\ntwo sets of faunas are with those of their respective continents--as of\r\ncourse they ought to be on the theory of evolution. Again, what would\r\nhave been the sense of creating useless foot-stalks for the imaginary\r\nsupport of absent eyes, not to mention all the other various grades of\r\ndegeneration in other cases? So that, upon the whole, if we agree with\r\nthe late Prof. Agassiz in regarding these cave animals as furnishing a\r\ncrucial test between the rival theories of creation and evolution, we\r\nmust further conclude that the whole body of evidence which they now\r\nfurnish is weighing on the side of evolution.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for a few special instances of what Darwin called\r\nrudimentary structures, but what may be more descriptively\r\ndesignated--in accordance with the theory of descent--obsolescent or\r\nvestigial structures. It is, however, of great importance to add that\r\nthese structures are of such general occurrence throughout both the\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms, that, as Darwin has observed, it is\r\nalmost impossible to point to a single species which does not present\r\none or more of them. In other words, it is almost impossible to find a\r\nsingle species which does not in this way bear some record of its own\r\ndescent from other species; and the more closely the structure of any\r\nspecies is examined anatomically, the more numerous are such records\r\nfound to be. Thus, for example, of all organisms that of man has been\r\nmost minutely investigated by anatomists; and therefore I think it will\r\nbe instructive to conclude this chapter by giving a list of the more\r\nnoteworthy vestigial structures which are known to occur in the human\r\nbody. I will take only those which are found in adult man, reserving for\r\nthe next chapter those which occur in a transitory manner during earlier\r\nperiods of his life. But, even as thus restricted, the number of\r\nobsolescent structures which we all present in our own persons is so\r\nremarkable, that their combined testimony to our descent from a\r\nquadrumanous ancestry appears to me in itself conclusive. I mean, that\r\neven if these structures stood alone, or apart from any more general\r\nevidences of our family relationships, they would be sufficient to prove\r\nour parentage. Nevertheless, it is desirable to remark that of course\r\nthese special evidences which I am about to detail do not stand alone.\r\nNot only is there the general analogy furnished by the general proof of\r\nevolution elsewhere, but there is likewise the more special\r\ncorrespondence between the whole of our anatomy and that of our nearest\r\nzoological allies. Now the force of this latter consideration is so\r\nenormous, that no one who has not studied human anatomy can be in a\r\nposition to appreciate it. For without special study it is impossible to\r\nform any adequate idea of the intricacy of structure which is presented\r\nby the human form. Yet it is found that this enormously intricate\r\norganization is repeated in all its details in the bodies of the higher\r\napes. There is no bone, muscle, nerve, or vessel of any importance in\r\nthe one which is not answered to by the other. Hence there are hundreds\r\nof thousands of instances of the most detailed correspondence, without\r\nthere being any instances to the contrary, if we pay due regard to\r\nvestigial characters. The entire corporeal structure of man is an exact\r\nanatomical copy of that which we find in the ape.\r\n\r\nMy object, then, here is to limit attention to those features of our\r\ncorporeal structure which, having become useless on account of our\r\nchange in attitude and habits, are in process of becoming obsolete, and\r\ntherefore occur as mere vestigial records of a former state of things.\r\nFor example, throughout the vertebrated series, from fish to mammals,\r\nthere occurs in the inner corner of the eye a semi-transparent eye-lid,\r\nwhich is called the nictitating membrane. The object of this structure\r\nis to sweep rapidly, every now and then, over the external surface of\r\nthe eye, apparently in order to keep the surface clean. But although the\r\nmembrane occurs in all classes of the sub-kingdom, it is more prevalent\r\nin some than in others--e.g. in birds than in mammals. Even, however,\r\nwhere it does not occur of a size and mobility to be of any use, it is\r\nusually represented, in animals above fishes, by a functionless\r\nrudiment, as here depicted in the case of man. (Fig. 10.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Illustrations of the nictitating membrane\r\n    in the various animals named drawn from nature. The letter N\r\n    indicates the membrane in each case. In man it is called the _plica\r\n    semilunaris_, and is represented in the two lower drawings under\r\n    this name. In the case of the shark (_Galeus_) the muscular\r\n    mechanism is shown as dissected.]\r\n\r\nNow the organization of man presents so many vestigial structures thus\r\nreferring to various stages of his long ancestral history, that it would\r\nbe tedious so much as to enumerate them. Therefore I will yet further\r\nlimit the list of vestigial structures to be given as examples, by not\r\nonly restricting these to cases which occur in our own organization; but\r\nof them I shall mention only such as refer us to the very last stage of\r\nour ancestral history--viz. structures which have become obsolescent\r\nsince the time when our distinctively human branch of the family tree\r\ndiverged from that of our immediate forefathers, the Quadrumana.\r\n\r\n(1) _Muscles of the external ear._--These, which are of large size and\r\nfunctional use in quadrupeds, we retain in a dwindled and useless\r\ncondition (Fig. 11). This is likewise the case in anthropoid apes; but\r\nin not a few other Quadrumana (e.g. baboons, macacus, magots, &c.)\r\ndegeneration has not proceeded so far, and the ears are voluntarily\r\nmoveable.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Rudimentary, or vestigial and useless,\r\n    muscles of the human ear. (From _Gray's Anatomy_.)]\r\n\r\n(2) _Panniculus carnosis._--A large number of the mammalia are able to\r\nmove their skin by means of sub-cutaneous muscle--as we see, for\r\ninstance, in a horse, when thus protecting himself against the sucking\r\nof flies. We, in common with the Quadrumana, possess an active remnant\r\nof such a muscle in the skin of the forehead, whereby we draw up the\r\neyebrows; but we are no longer able to use other considerable remnants\r\nof it, in the scalp and elsewhere,--or, more correctly, it is rarely\r\nthat we meet with persons who can. But most of the Quadrumana (including\r\nthe anthropoids) are still able to do so. There are also many other\r\nvestigial muscles, which occur only in a small percentage of human\r\nbeings, but which, when they do occur, present unmistakeable homologies\r\nwith normal muscles in some of the Quadrumana and still lower\r\nanimals[5].\r\n\r\n    [5] See especially Mr. John Wood's papers, _Proc. R. S._, xiii to\r\n    xvi, and xviii; also _Journ. Anat._, i and iii. In this connexion\r\n    Darwin refers to M. Richard, _Annls. d. Sc. Nat. Zoolg._, tom.\r\n    xviii, p. 13, 1852.\r\n\r\n(3) _Feet._--It is observable that in the infant the feet have a strong\r\ndeflection inwards, so that the soles in considerable measure face one\r\nanother. This peculiarity, which is even more marked in the embryo than\r\nin the infant (see p. 153), and which becomes gradually less and less\r\nconspicuous even before the child begins to walk, appears to me a highly\r\nsuggestive peculiarity. For it plainly refers to the condition of\r\nthings in the Quadrumana, seeing that in all these animals the feet are\r\nsimilarly curved inwards, to facilitate the grasping of branches. And\r\neven when walking on the ground apes and monkeys employ to a great\r\nextent the outside edges of their feet, as does also a child when\r\nlearning to walk. The feet of a young child are also extraordinarily\r\nmobile in all directions, as are those of apes. In order to show these\r\npoints, I here introduce comparative drawings of a young ape and the\r\nportrait of a young male child. These drawings, moreover, serve at the\r\nsame time to illustrate two other vestigial characters, which have\r\noften been previously noticed with regard to the infant's foot. I allude\r\nto the incurved form of the legs, and the lateral extension of the great\r\ntoe, whereby it approaches the thumb-like character of this organ in the\r\nQuadrumana. As in the case of the incurved position of the legs and\r\nfeet, so in this case of the lateral extensibility of the great toe, the\r\npeculiarity is even more marked in embryonic than in infant life. For,\r\nas Prof. Wyman has remarked with regard to the foetus when about an inch\r\nin length, \"The great toe is shorter than the others; and, instead of\r\nbeing parallel to them, is projected at an angle from the side of the\r\nfoot, thus corresponding with the permanent condition of this part in\r\nthe Quadrumana[6].\" So that this organ, which, according to Owen, \"is\r\nperhaps the most characteristic peculiarity in the human structure,\"\r\nwhen traced back to the early stages of its development, is found to\r\npresent a notably less degree of peculiarity.\r\n\r\n    [6] _Proc. Nat. Hist. Soc._, Boston, 1863.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Portrait of a young male gorilla (after\r\n    Hartmann).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Portrait of a young male child.\r\n    Photographed from life, when the mobile feet were for a short time\r\n    at rest in a position of extreme inflection.]\r\n\r\n(4) _Hands._--Dr. Louis Robinson has recently observed that the grasping\r\npower of the whole human hand is so surprisingly great at birth, and\r\nduring the first few weeks of infancy, as to be far in excess of present\r\nrequirements on the part of a young child. Hence he concludes that it\r\nrefers us to our quadrumanous ancestry--the young of anthropoid apes\r\nbeing endowed with similar powers of grasping, in order to hold on to\r\nthe hair of the mother when she is using her arms for the purposes of\r\nlocomotion. This inference appears to me justifiable, inasmuch as no\r\nother explanation can be given of the comparatively inordinate muscular\r\nforce of an infant's grip. For experiments showed that very young babies\r\nare able to support their own weight, by holding on to a horizontal bar,\r\nfor a period varying from one half to more than two minutes[7]. With his\r\nkind permission I here reproduce one of Dr. Robinson's instantaneous,\r\nand hitherto unpublished, photographs of a very young infant. This\r\nphotograph was taken after the above paragraph (3) was written, and I\r\nintroduce it here because it serves to show incidentally--and perhaps\r\neven better than the preceding figure--the points there mentioned with\r\nregard to the feet and great toes. Again, as Dr. Robinson observes, the\r\nattitude, and the disproportionately large development of the arms as\r\ncompared with the legs, give all the photographs a striking resemblance\r\nto a picture of the chimpanzee \"Sally\" at the Zoological Gardens. For\r\n\"invariably the thighs are bent nearly at right angles to the body, and\r\nin no case did the lower limbs hang down and take the attitude of the\r\nerect position.\" He adds, \"In many cases no sign of distress is evinced,\r\nand no cry uttered, until the grasp begins to give way.\"\r\n\r\n    [7] _Nineteenth Century_, November, 1891.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--An infant, three weeks old, supporting its\r\n    own weight for over two minutes. The attitude of the lower limbs,\r\n    feet, and toes, is strikingly simian. Reproduced from an\r\n    instantaneous photograph, kindly given for the purpose by Dr. L.\r\n    Robinson.]\r\n\r\n(5) _Tail._--The absence of a tail in man is popularly supposed to\r\nconstitute a difficulty against the doctrine of his quadrumanous\r\ndescent. As a matter of fact, however, the absence of an external tail\r\nin man is precisely what this doctrine would expect, seeing that the\r\nnearest allies of man in the quadrumanous series are likewise destitute\r\nof an external tail. Far, then, from this deficiency in man constituting\r\nany difficulty to be accounted for, if the case were not so--i. e. if\r\nman _did_ possess an external tail,--the difficulty would be to\r\nunderstand how he had managed to retain an organ which had been\r\nrenounced by his most recent ancestors. Nevertheless, as the anthropoid\r\napes continue to present the rudimentary vestiges of a tail in a few\r\ncaudal vertebrae below the integuments, we might well expect to find a\r\nsimilar state of matters in the case of man. And this is just what we do\r\nfind, as a glance at these two comparative illustrations will show.\r\n(Fig. 15.) Moreover, during embryonic life, both of the anthropoid apes\r\nand of man, the tail much more closely resembles that of the lower kinds\r\nof quadrumanous animals from which these higher representatives of the\r\ngroup have descended. For at a certain stage of embryonic life the tail,\r\nboth of apes and of human beings, is actually longer than the legs (see\r\nFig. 16). And at this stage of development, also, the tail admits of\r\nbeing moved by muscles which later on dwindle away. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, these muscles persist, and are then described by anatomists as\r\nabnormalities. The following illustrations serve to show the muscles in\r\nquestion, when thus found in adult man.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Sacrum of Gorilla compared with that of\r\n    Man, showing the rudimentary tail-bones of each. Drawn from nature\r\n    (_R. Coll. Surg. Mus._).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Diagrammatic outline of the human embryo\r\n    when about seven weeks old, showing the relations of the limbs and\r\n    tail to the trunk (after Allen Thomson), _r_, the radial, and _u_,\r\n    the ulnar, border of the hand and fore-arm; _t_, the tibial, and\r\n    _f_, the fibular, border of the foot and lower leg; _au_, ear; _s_,\r\n    spinal cord; _v_, umbilical cord; _b_, branchial gill-slits; _c_,\r\n    tail.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Front and back view of adult human sacrum,\r\n    showing abnormal persistence of vestigial tail-muscles.

(Fig. 19.) In\r\nsome of the lower herbivorous animals it is longer than the entire body.\r\n\r\nLike vestigial structures in general, however, this one is highly\r\nvariable. Thus the above cut (Fig. 19) serves to show that it may\r\nsometimes be almost as short in the orang as it normally is in man--both\r\nthe human subjects of this illustration having been normal.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--_Appendix vermiformis_ in Orang and in Man.\r\n    Drawn from dried inflated specimens in the Cambridge Museum by Mr.\r\n    J.

The peculiarity consists in a little blunt\r\n     point, projecting from the inwardly folded margin, or helix. When\r\n     present, it is developed at birth, and, according to Prof. Ludwig\r\n     Meyer, more frequently in man than in woman. Mr. Woolner made an\r\n     exact model of one such case, and sent me the accompanying\r\n     drawing.... The helix obviously consists of the extreme margin of\r\n     the ear folded inwards; and the folding appears to be in some\r\n     manner connected with the whole external ear being permanently\r\n     pressed backwards. In many monkeys, which do not stand high in the\r\n     order, as baboons and some species of macacus, the upper portion of\r\n     the ear is slightly pointed, and the margin is not at all folded\r\n     inwards; but if the margin were to be thus folded, a slight point\r\n     would necessarily project towards the centre.... The following\r\n     wood-cut is an accurate copy of a photograph of the foetus of an\r\n     orang (kindly sent me by Dr. Nitsche), in which it may be seen how\r\n     different the pointed outline of the ear is at this period from its\r\n     adult condition, when it bears a close general resemblance to that\r\n     of man [including even the occasional appearance of the projecting\r\n     point shown in the preceding woodcut]. It is evident that the\r\n     folding over of the tip of such an ear, unless it changed greatly\r\n     during its further development, would give rise to a point\r\n     projecting inwards[8].\r\n\r\n    [8] _Descent of Man_, 2nd ed., pp. 15-16.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Human ear, modelled and drawn by Mr.\r\n    Woolner. _a_, the projecting point.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Foetus of an Orang. Exact copy of a\r\n    photograph, showing the form of the ear at this early stage.]\r\n\r\nThe following woodcut serves still further to show vestigial\r\nresemblances between the human ear and that of apes. The last two\r\nfigures illustrate the general resemblance between the normal ear of\r\nfoetal man and the ear of an adult orang-outang. The other two figures\r\non the lower line are intended to exhibit occasional modifications of\r\nthe adult human ear, which approximate simian characters somewhat more\r\nclosely than does the normal type. It will be observed that in their\r\ncomparatively small lobes these ears resemble those of all the apes; and\r\nthat while the outer margin of one is not unlike that of the Barbary\r\nape, the outer margin of the other follows those of the chimpanzee and\r\norang. Of course it would be easy to select individual human ears which\r\npresent either of these characters in a more pronounced degree; but\r\nthese ears have been chosen as models because they present both\r\ncharacters in conjunction. The upper row of figures likewise shows the\r\nclose similarity of hair-tracts, and the direction of growth on the part\r\nof the hair itself, in cases where the human ear happens to be of an\r\nabnormally hirsute character. But this particular instance (which I do\r\nnot think has been previously noticed) introduces us to the subject of\r\nhair, and hair-growth, in general.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Vestigial characters of human ears. Drawn\r\n    from nature.]\r\n\r\n(8) _Hair._--Adult man presents rudimentary hair over most parts of the\r\nbody. Wallace has sought to draw a refined distinction between this\r\nvestigial coating and the useful coating of quadrumanous animals, in the\r\nabsence of the former from the human back. But even this refined\r\ndistinction does not hold. On the one hand, the comparatively hairless\r\nchimpanzee which died last year in the Zoological Gardens (_T. calvus_)\r\nwas remarkably denuded over the back; and, on the other hand, men who\r\npresent a considerable development of hair over the rest of their bodies\r\npresent it also on their backs and shoulders. Again, in all men the\r\nrudimentary hair on the upper and lower arm is directed towards the\r\nelbow--a peculiarity which occurs nowhere else in the animal kingdom,\r\nwith the exception of the anthropoid apes and a few American monkeys,\r\nwhere it presumably has to do with arboreal habits. For, when sitting in\r\ntrees, the orang, as observed by Mr. Wallace, places its hands above its\r\nhead with its elbows pointing downwards: the disposition of hair on\r\nthe arms and fore-arms then has the effect of thatch in turning the\r\nrain. Again, I find that in all species of apes, monkeys, and baboons\r\nwhich I have examined (and they have been numerous), the hair on the\r\nbacks of the hands and feet is continued as far as the first row of\r\nphalanges; but becomes scanty, or disappears altogether, on the second\r\nrow; while it is invariably absent on the terminal row. I also find that\r\nthe same peculiarity occurs in man. We all have rudimentary hair on the\r\nfirst row of phalanges, both of hands and feet: when present at all, it\r\nis more scanty on the second row; and in no case have I been able to\r\nfind any on the terminal row. In all cases these peculiarities are\r\ncongenital, and the total absence or partial presence of hair on the\r\nsecond phalanges is constant in different species of Quadrumana. For\r\ninstance, it is entirely absent in all the chimpanzees, which I have\r\nexamined, while scantily present in all the orangs. As in man, it occurs\r\nin a patch midway between the joints.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Hair-tracts on the arms and hands of Man,\r\n    as compared with those on the arms and hands of Chimpanzee. Drawn\r\n    from life.]\r\n\r\nBesides showing these two features with regard to the disposition of\r\nhair on the human arm and hand, the above woodcut illustrates a third.\r\nBy looking closely at the arm of the very hairy man from whom the\r\ndrawing was taken, it could be seen that there was a strong tendency\r\ntowards a whorled arrangement of the hairs on the backs of the wrists.\r\nThis is likewise, as a general rule, a marked feature in the arrangement\r\nof hair on the same places in the gorilla, orang, and chimpanzee. In the\r\nspecimen of the latter, however, from which the drawing was taken, this\r\ncharacteristic was not well marked. The downward direction of the hair\r\non the backs of the hands is exactly the same in man as it is in all\r\nthe anthropoid apes. Again, with regard to hair, Darwin notices that\r\noccasionally there appears in man a few hairs in the eyebrows much\r\nlonger than the others; and that they seem to be representative of\r\nsimilarly long and scattered hairs which occur in the chimpanzee,\r\nmacacus, and baboons.\r\n\r\nLastly, it may be here more conveniently observed than in the next\r\nchapter on Embryology, that at about the sixth month the human foetus\r\nis often thickly coated with somewhat long dark hair over the entire\r\nbody, except the soles of the feet and palms of the hands, which are\r\nlikewise bare in all quadrumanous animals. This covering, which is\r\ncalled the lanugo, and sometimes extends even to the whole forehead,\r\nears, and face, is shed before birth. So that it appears to be useless\r\nfor any purpose other than that of emphatically declaring man a child of\r\nthe monkey.\r\n\r\n(9) _Teeth._--Darwin writes:--\r\n\r\n     It appears as if the posterior molar or wisdom-teeth were tending\r\n     to become rudimentary in the more civilized races of man. These\r\n     teeth are rather smaller than the other molars, as is likewise the\r\n     case with the corresponding teeth in the chimpanzee and orang; and\r\n     they have only two separate fangs.... They are also much more\r\n     liable to vary, both in structure and in the period of their\r\n     development, than the other teeth. In the Melanian races, on the\r\n     other hand, the wisdom-teeth are usually furnished with three\r\n     separate fangs, and are usually sound [i. e. not specially liable\r\n     to decay]; they also differ from the other molars in size, less\r\n     than in the Caucasian races.\r\n\r\nNow, in addition to these there are other respects in which the\r\ndwindling condition of wisdom-teeth is manifested--particularly with\r\nregard to the pattern of their crowns. Indeed, in this respect it would\r\nseem that even in the anthropoid apes there is the beginning of a\r\ntendency to degeneration of the molar teeth from behind forwards. For if\r\nwe compare the three molars in the lower jaw of the gorilla, orang, and\r\nchimpanzee, we find that the gorilla has five well-marked cusps on all\r\nthree of them; but that in the orang the cusps are not so pronounced,\r\nwhile in the chimpanzee there are only four of them on the third molar.\r\nNow in man it is only the first of these three teeth which normally\r\npresents five cusps, both the others presenting only four. So that,\r\ncomparing all these genera together, it appears that the number of\r\ncusps is being reduced from behind forwards; the chimpanzee having lost\r\none of them from the third molar, while man has not only lost this, but\r\nalso one from the second molar,--and, it may be added, likewise\r\npartially (or even totally) from the first molar, as a frequent\r\nvariation among civilized races. But, on the other hand, variations are\r\noften met with in the opposite direction, where the second or the third\r\nmolar of man presents five cusps--in the one case following the\r\nchimpanzee, in the other the gorilla. These latter variations,\r\ntherefore, may fairly be regarded as reversionary. For these facts I am\r\nindebted to the kindness of Mr. C. S. Tomes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Molar teeth of lower jaw in Gorilla, Orang,\r\n    and Man. Drawn from nature, nat. size (_R. Mus. Coll. Surg._).]\r\n\r\n(10) _Perforations of the humerus._--The peculiarities which we have to\r\nnotice under this heading are two in number. First, the supra condyloid\r\nforamen is a normal feature in some of the lower Quadrumana (Fig. 25),\r\nwhere it gives passage to the great nerve of the fore-arm, and often\r\nalso to the great artery. In man, however, it is not a normal feature.\r\nYet it occurs in a small percentage of cases--viz., according to Sir W.\r\nTurner, in about one per cent., and therefore is regarded by Darwin as a\r\nvestigial character. Secondly, there is inter-condyloid foramen, which\r\nis also situated near the lower end of the humerus, but more in the\r\nmiddle of the bone. This occurs, but not constantly, in apes, and also\r\nin the human species. From the fact that it does so much more frequently\r\nin the bones of ancient--and also of some savage--races of mankind (viz.\r\nin 20 to 30 per cent. of cases), Darwin is disposed to regard it also as\r\na vestigial feature. On the other hand, Prof. Flower tells me that in\r\nhis opinion it is but an expression of impoverished nutrition during\r\nthe growth of the bone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Perforation of the humerus (supra-condyloid\r\n    foramen) in three species of Quadrumana where it normally occurs,\r\n    and in Man, where it does not normally occur. Drawn from nature (_R.\r\n    Coll. Surg. Mus._).]\r\n\r\n(11) _Flattening of tibia._--In some very ancient human skeletons, there\r\nhas also been found a lateral flattening of the tibia, which rarely\r\noccurs in any existing human beings, but which appears to have been\r\nusual among the earliest races of mankind hitherto discovered. According\r\nto Broca, the measurements of these fossil human tibiae resemble those of\r\napes. Moreover, the bone is bent and strongly convex forwards, while its\r\nangles are so rounded as to present the nearly oval section seen in\r\napes. It is in association with these ape-like human tibiae that\r\nperforated humeri of man are found in greatest abundance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, there is reason to doubt whether this form\r\nof tibia in man is really a survival from his quadrumanous ancestry.\r\nFor, as Boyd-Dawkins and Hartmann have pointed out, the degree of\r\nflattening presented by some of these ancient human bones is _greater_\r\nthan that which occurs in any existing species of anthropoid ape. Of\r\ncourse the possibility remains that the unknown species of ape from\r\nwhich man descended may have had its tibia more flattened than is now\r\nobservable in any of the existing species. Nevertheless, as some doubt\r\nattaches to this particular case, I do not press it--and, indeed, only\r\nmention it at all in order that the doubt may be expressed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I will conclude by remarking that several other instances of\r\nthe survival of vestigial structures in man have been alleged, which are\r\nof a still more doubtful character. Of such, for example, are the\r\nsupposed absence of the genial tubercle in the case of a very ancient\r\njaw-bone of man, and the disposition of valves in human veins. From the\r\nformer it was argued that the possessor of this very ancient jaw-bone\r\nwas probably speechless, inasmuch as the tubercle in existing man gives\r\nattachment to muscles of the tongue. From the latter it has been argued\r\nthat all the valves in the veins of the human body have reference, in\r\ntheir disposition, to the incidence of blood-pressure when the attitude\r\nof the body is horizontal, or quadrupedal. Now, the former case has\r\nalready broken down, and I find that the latter does not hold. But we\r\ncan well afford to lose such doubtful and spurious cases, in view of all\r\nthe foregoing unquestionable and genuine cases of vestigial structures\r\nwhich are to be met with even within the limits of our own\r\norganization--and even when these limits are still further limited by\r\nselecting only those instances which refer to the very latest chapter of\r\nour long ancestral history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEMBRYOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will next consider what of late years has become the most important\r\nof the lines of evidence, not only in favour of the general fact of\r\nevolution, but also of its history: I mean the evidence which has been\r\nyielded by the newest of the sciences, the science of Embryology. But\r\nhere, as in the analogous case of adult morphology, in order to do\r\njustice to the mass of evidence which has now been accumulated, a whole\r\nvolume would be necessary. As in that previous case, therefore, I must\r\nrestrict myself to giving an outline sketch of the main facts.\r\n\r\nFirst I will display what in the language of Paley we may call \"the\r\nstate of the argument.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an observable fact that there is often a close correspondence\r\nbetween developmental changes as revealed by any chronological series of\r\nfossils which may happen to have been preserved, and developmental\r\nchanges which may be observed during the life-history of now existing\r\nindividuals belonging to the same group of animals. For instance, the\r\nsuccessive development of prongs in the horns of deer-like animals,\r\nwhich is so clearly shown in the geological history of this tribe, is\r\nclosely reproduced in the life-history of existing deer. Or, in other\r\nwords, the antlers of an existing deer furnish in their development a\r\nkind of _resume_, or recapitulation, of the successive phases whereby\r\nthe primitive horn was gradually superseded by horns presenting a\r\ngreater and greater number of prongs in successive species of extinct\r\ndeer (Fig. 26). Now it must be obvious that such a recapitulation in the\r\nlife-history of an existing animal of developmental changes successively\r\ndistinctive of sundry allied, though now extinct species, speaks\r\nstrongly in favour of evolution. For as it is of the essence of this\r\ntheory that new forms arise from older forms by way of _hereditary_\r\ndescent, we should antecedently expect, if the theory is true, that the\r\nphases of development presented by the individual organism would follow,\r\nin their main outlines, those phases of development through which their\r\nlong line of ancestors had passed. The only alternative view is that as\r\nspecies of deer, for instance, were separately created, additional\r\nprongs were successively added to their antlers; and yet that, in order\r\nto be so added to successive species every individual deer belonging to\r\nlater species was required to repeat in his own lifetime the process of\r\nsuccessive additions which had previously taken place in a remote series\r\nof extinct species. Now I do not deny that this view is a possible view;\r\nbut I do deny that it is a probable one. According to the evolutionary\r\ninterpretation of such facts, we can see a very good _reason_ why the\r\nlife-history of the individual is thus a condensed _resume_ of the\r\nlife-history of its ancestral species. But according to the opposite\r\nview no reason can be assigned why such should be the case. In a\r\nprevious chapter--the chapter on Classification--we have seen that if\r\neach species were created separately, no reason can be assigned why they\r\nshould all have been turned out upon structural patterns so strongly\r\nsuggestive of hereditary descent with gradual modifications, or slow\r\ndivergence--the result being group subordinated to group, with the most\r\ngeneralized (or least developed) forms at the bottom, and the highest\r\nproducts of organization at the top. And now we see--or shall\r\nimmediately see--that this consideration admits of being greatly\r\nfortified by a study of the developmental history of every individual\r\norganism. If it would be an unaccountable fact that every separately\r\ncreated species should have been created with close structural\r\nresemblances to a certain limited number of other species, less close\r\nresemblances to certain further species, and so backwards; assuredly it\r\nwould be a still more unaccountable fact that every individual of every\r\nspecies should exhibit in its own person a history of developmental\r\nchange, every term of which corresponds with the structural\r\npeculiarities of its now extinct predecessors--and this in the exact\r\nhistorical order of their succession in geological time. The more that\r\nwe think about this antithesis between the naturalistic and the\r\nnon-naturalistic interpretations, the greater must we feel the contrast\r\nin respect of rationality to become; and, therefore, I need not spend\r\ntime by saying anything further upon the antecedent standing of the two\r\ntheories in this respect. The evidence, then, which I am about to adduce\r\nfrom the study of development in the life-histories of individual\r\norganisms, will be regarded by me as so much unquestionable evidence in\r\nfavour of similar processes of development in the life-histories of\r\ntheir respective species--in so far, I mean, as the two sets of changes\r\nadmit of being proved parallel.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Antlers of Stag, showing successive\r\n    addition of branches in successive years. Drawn from nature (_Brit.\r\n    Mus._).]\r\n\r\nIn the only illustration hitherto adduced--viz. that of deers'\r\nhorns--the series of changes from a one-pronged horn to a fully\r\ndeveloped arborescent antler, is a series which takes place during the\r\nadult life of the animal; for it is only when the breeding age has been\r\nattained that horns are required to appear. But seeing that every animal\r\npasses through most of the phases of its development, not only before\r\nthe breeding age has been attained, but even before the time of its own\r\nbirth, clearly the largest field for the study of individual development\r\nis furnished by embryology. For instance, there is a salamander which\r\ndiffers from most other salamanders in being exclusively terrestrial in\r\nits habits. Now, the young of this salamander before their birth are\r\nfound to be furnished with gills, which, however, they are never\r\ndestined to use. Yet these gills are so perfectly formed, that if the\r\nyoung salamanders be removed from the body of their mother shortly\r\nbefore birth, and be then immediately placed in water, the little\r\nanimals show themselves quite capable of aquatic respiration, and will\r\nmerrily swim about in a medium which would quickly drown their own\r\nparent. Here, then, we have both morphological and physiological\r\nevidence pointing to the possession of gills by the ancestors of the\r\nland salamander.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to devote the whole of the present chapter to an\r\nenumeration of special instances of the kinds thus chosen for purposes\r\nof illustration; but as it is desirable to take a deeper, and therefore\r\na more general view of the whole subject, I will begin at the\r\nfoundation, and gradually work up from the earliest stages of\r\ndevelopment to the latest. Before starting, however, I ask the reader to\r\nbear in mind one consideration, which must reasonably prevent our\r\nanticipating that in _every case_ the life-history of an individual\r\norganism should present a _full_ recapitulation of the life-history of\r\nits ancestral line of species. Supposing the theory of evolution to be\r\ntrue, it must follow that in many cases it would have been more or less\r\ndisadvantageous to a developing type that it should have been obliged to\r\nreproduce in its individual representatives all the phases of\r\ndevelopment previously undergone by its ancestry--even within the limits\r\nof the same family. We can easily understand, for example, that the\r\nwaste of material required for building up the useless gills of the\r\nembryonic salamanders is a waste which, sooner or later, is likely to be\r\ndone away with; so that the fact of its occurring at all is in itself\r\nenough to show that the change from aquatic to terrestrial habits on the\r\npart of this species must have been one of comparatively recent\r\noccurrence. Now, in as far as it is detrimental to a developing type\r\nthat it should pass through any particular ancestral phases of\r\ndevelopment, we may be sure that natural selection--or whatever other\r\nadjustive causes we may suppose to have been at work in the adaptation\r\nof organisms to their surroundings--will constantly seek to get rid of\r\nthis necessity, with the result, when successful, of dropping out the\r\ndetrimental phases. Thus the foreshortening of developmental history\r\nwhich takes place in the individual lifetime may be expected often to\r\ntake place, not only in the way of condensation, but also in the way of\r\nexcision. Many pages of ancestral history may be recapitulated in the\r\nparagraphs of embryonic development, while others may not be so much as\r\nmentioned. And that this is the true explanation of what embryologists\r\nterm \"direct\" development--or of a more or less sudden leap from one\r\nphase to another, without any appearance of intermediate phases--is\r\nproved by the fact that in some cases both direct and indirect\r\ndevelopment occur within the same group of organisms, some genera or\r\nfamilies having dropped out the intermediate phases which other genera\r\nor families retain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe argument from embryology must be taken to begin with the first\r\nbeginning of individual life in the ovum. And, in order to understand\r\nthe bearings of the argument in this its first stage, we must consider\r\nthe phenomena of reproduction in the simplest form which these phenomena\r\nare known to present.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the animal kingdom is divided into two great groups, which\r\nare called the Protozoa and the Metazoa. Similarly, the whole of the\r\nvegetable kingdom is divided into the Protophyta and the Metaphyta. The\r\ncharacteristic feature of all the Protozoa and Protophyta is that the\r\norganism consists of a single physiological cell, while the\r\ncharacteristic of all the Metazoa and Metaphyta is that the organism\r\nconsists of a plurality of physiological cells, variously modified to\r\nsubserve different functions in the economy of the animal or plant, as\r\nthe case may be. For the sake of brevity, I shall hereafter deal only\r\nwith the case of animals (Protozoa and Metazoa); but it may throughout\r\nbe understood that everything which is said applies also to the case of\r\nplants (Protophyta and Metaphyta).\r\n\r\nA Protozooen (like a Protophyton) is a solitary cell, or a \"unicellular\r\norganism,\" while a Metazooen (like a Metaphyton) is a society of cells,\r\nor a \"multicellular organism.\" Now, it is only in the multicellular\r\norganisms that there is any observable distinction of sex. In all the\r\nunicellular organisms the phenomena of reproduction appear to be more or\r\nless identical with those of growth. Nevertheless, as these phenomena\r\nare here in some cases suggestively peculiar, I will consider them more\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\nA Protozooen is a single corpuscle of protoplasm which in different\r\nspecies of Protozoa varies in size from more than one inch to less than\r\n1/1000 of an inch in diameter. In some species there is an enveloping\r\ncortical substance; in other species no such substance can be detected.\r\nAgain, in most species there is a nucleus, while in other species no\r\nsuch differentiation of structure has hitherto been observed.\r\nNevertheless, from the fact that the nucleus occurs in the majority of\r\nProtozoa, coupled with the fact that the demonstration of this body is\r\noften a matter of extreme difficulty, not only in some of the Protozoa\r\nwhere it has been but recently detected, but also in the case of certain\r\nphysiological cells elsewhere,--from these facts it is not unreasonable\r\nto suppose that all the Protozoa possess a nucleus, whether or not it\r\nadmits of being rendered visible by histological methods thus far at our\r\ndisposal. If this is the case, we should be justified in saying, as I\r\nhave said, that a Protozooen is an isolated physiological cell, and, like\r\ncells in general, multiplies by means of what Spencer and Haeckel have\r\naptly called a process of discontinuous growth. That is to say, when a\r\ncell reaches maturity, further growth takes place in the direction of a\r\nseverance of its substance--the separated portion thus starting anew as\r\na distinct physiological unit. But, notwithstanding the complex changes\r\nwhich have been more recently observed to take place in the nucleus of\r\nsome Protozoa prior to their division, the process of multiplication by\r\ndivision may still be regarded as a process of growth, which differs\r\nfrom the previous growth of the individual cell in being attended by a\r\nseverance of continuity. If we take a suspended drop of gum, and\r\ngradually add to its size by allowing more and more gum to flow into it,\r\na point will eventually be reached at which the force of gravity will\r\novercome that of cohesion, and a portion of the drop will fall away from\r\nthe remainder. Here we have a rough physical simile, although of course\r\nno true analogy. In virtue of a continuous assimilation of nutriment,\r\nthe protoplasm of a cell increases in mass, until it reaches the size at\r\nwhich the forces of disruption overcome those of cohesion--or, in other\r\nwords, the point at which increase of size is no longer compatible with\r\ncontinuity of substance. Nevertheless, it must not be supposed that the\r\nprocess is thus merely a physical one. The phenomena which occur even in\r\nthe simplest--or so-called \"direct\"--cell-division, are of themselves\r\nenough to prove that the process is vital, or physiological; and this in\r\na high degree of specialization. But so, likewise, are all processes of\r\ngrowth in organic structures; and therefore the simile of the drop of\r\ngum is not to be regarded as a true analogy: it serves only to indicate\r\nthe fact that when cell-growth proceeds beyond a certain point\r\ncell-division ensues. The size to which cells may grow before they thus\r\ndivide is very variable in different kinds of cells; for while some may\r\nnormally attain a length of ten or twelve inches, others divide before\r\nthey measure 1/1000 of an inch. This, however, is a matter of detail,\r\nand does not affect the general physiological principles on which we are\r\nat present engaged.\r\n\r\nNow, as we have seen, a Protozooen is a single cell; for even although in\r\nsome of the higher forms of protozoal life a colony of cells may be\r\nbound together in organic connexion, each of these cells is in itself an\r\n\"individual,\" capable of self-nourishment, reproduction, and, generally,\r\nof independent existence. Consequently, when the growth of a Protozooen\r\nends in a division of its substance, the two parts wander away from each\r\nother as separate organisms. (Fig. 27.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Fission of a Protozooen. In the left-hand\r\n    drawing the process is represented as having advanced sufficiently\r\n    far to have caused a division and segregation both of the nucleus\r\n    and the vesicle. In the right-hand drawing the process is\r\n    represented as complete. _n_, N, severed nucleus; _vc_, severed\r\n    vesicle; _ps_, pseudopodia; _f_, ingested food.]\r\n\r\nThe next point we have to observe is, that in all cases where a cell or\r\na Protozooen multiplies by way of fissiparous division, the process\r\nbegins in the nucleus. If the nucleus divides into two parts, the whole\r\ncell will eventually divide into two parts, each of which retains a\r\nportion of the original nucleus, as represented in the above figure. If\r\nthe nucleus divides into three, four, or even, as happens in the\r\ndevelopment of some embryonic tissues, into as many as six parts, the\r\ncell will subdivide into a corresponding number, each retaining a\r\nportion of the nucleus. Therefore, in all cases of fissiparous division,\r\nthe seat or origin of the process is the nucleus.\r\n\r\nThus far, then, the phenomena of multiplication are identical in all the\r\nlowest or unicellular organisms, and in the constituent cells of all the\r\nhigher or multicellular. And this is the first point which I desire to\r\nmake apparent. For where the object is to prove a continuity between the\r\nphenomena of growth and reproduction, it is of primary importance to\r\nshow--1st, that there is such a continuity in the case of all the\r\nunicellular organisms, and, 2nd, that there are all the above points of\r\nresemblance between the multiplication of cells in the unicellular and\r\nin the multicellular organisms.\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider the points of difference, and, if possible, to\r\nshow that these do not go to disprove the doctrine of continuity which\r\nthe points of resemblance so forcibly indicate.\r\n\r\nThe first point of difference obviously is, that in the case of all the\r\nmulticellular organisms the two or more \"daughter-cells,\" which are\r\nproduced by division of the \"mother-cell,\" do not wander away from one\r\nanother; but, as a rule, they continue to be held in more or less close\r\napposition by means of other cells and binding membranes,--with the\r\nresult of giving rise to those various \"tissues,\" which in turn go to\r\nconstitute the material of \"organs.\" I cannot suppose, however, that any\r\nadvocate of discontinuity will care to take his stand at this point.\r\nBut, if any one were so foolish as to do so, it would be easy to\r\ndislodge him by describing the state of matters in some of the Protozoa\r\nwhere a number of unicellular \"individuals\" are organically united so as\r\nto form a \"colony.\" These cases serve to bridge this distinction between\r\nProtozoa and Metazoa, of which therefore we may now take leave.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there is the no less obvious distinction that the\r\nresult of cell-division in the Metazoa is not merely to multiply cells\r\nall of the same kind: on the contrary, the process here gives rise to as\r\nmany different kinds of cells as there are different kinds of tissue\r\ncomposing the adult organism. But no one, I should think, is likely to\r\noppose the doctrine of continuity on the ground of this distinction. For\r\nthe distinction is clearly one which must necessarily arise, if the\r\ndoctrine of continuity between unicellular and multicellular organisms\r\nbe true. In other words, it is a distinction which the theory of\r\nevolution itself must necessarily pre-suppose, and therefore it is no\r\nobjection to the theory that its pre-supposition is realized. Moreover,\r\nas we shall see better presently, there is no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding why this distinction should have arisen, so soon as it\r\nbecame necessary (or desirable) that individual cells, when composing a\r\n\"colony,\" should conform to the economic principle of the division of\r\nlabour--a principle, indeed, which is already foreshadowed in the\r\nconstituent parts of a single cell, since the nucleus has one set of\r\nfunctions and its surrounding protoplasm another.\r\n\r\nBut now, in the third place, we arrive at a more important distinction,\r\nand one which lies at the root of the others still remaining to be\r\nconsidered. I refer to sexual propagation. For it is a peculiarity of\r\nthe multicellular organisms that, although many of them may likewise\r\npropagate themselves by other means (Fig. 28), they all propagate\r\nthemselves by means of sexual congress. Now, in its essence, sexual\r\ncongress consists in the fusion of two specialized cells (or, as now\r\nseems almost certain, of the nuclei thereof), so that it is out of such\r\na combination that the new individual arises by means of successive\r\ncell-divisions, which, beginning in the fertilized ovum, eventually\r\nbuild up all the tissues and organs of the body.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--_Hydra viridis_, partly in section. M,\r\n    mouth; O, ovary, or bud containing female reproductive cells; T,\r\n    testis, or bud containing male reproductive cells. In addition to\r\n    these buds containing germinal elements alone, there is another\r\n    which illustrates the process of \"gemmation\"--i. e. the direct\r\n    out-growth of a fully formed offspring.]\r\n\r\nThis process clearly indicates very high specialization on the part of\r\ngerm-cells. For we see by it that although these cells when young\r\nresemble all other cells in being capable of self-multiplication by\r\nbinary division (thus reproducing cells exactly like themselves), when\r\nolder they lose this power; but, at the same time, they acquire an\r\nentirely new and very remarkable power of giving rise to a vast\r\nsuccession of many different kinds of cells, all of which are mutually\r\ncorrelated as to their several functions, so as to constitute a\r\nhierarchy of cells--or, to speak literally, a multicellular\r\n_co-organization_. Here it is that we touch the really important\r\ndistinction between the Protozoa and the Metazoa; for although I have\r\nsaid that some of the higher Protozoa foreshadow this state of matters\r\nin forming cell-colonies, it must now be noted that the cells composing\r\nsuch colonies are all of the same kind; and, therefore, that the\r\nprinciple of producing different kinds of cells which, by mutual\r\nco-adaptation of functions, shall be capable of constructing a\r\nmulticellular Metazooen,--this great principle of _co-organization_ is\r\nbut dimly nascent in the cell-colonies of Protozoa. And its marvellous\r\ndevelopment in the Metazoa appears ultimately to depend upon the highly\r\nspecialized character of germ-cells. Even in cases where multicellular\r\norganisms are capable of reproducing their kind without the need of any\r\npreceding process of fertilization (parthenogenesis), and even in the\r\nstill more numerous cases where complete organisms are budded forth from\r\nany part of their parent organism (gemmation, Fig. 28), there is now\r\nvery good reason to conclude that these powers of a-sexual reproduction\r\non the part of multicellular organisms are all ultimately due to the\r\nspecialized character of their germ-cells. For in all these cases the\r\ntissues of the parent, from which the budding takes place, were\r\nultimately derived from germ-cells--no matter how many generations of\r\nbudded organisms may have intervened. And that propagation by budding,\r\n&c, in multicellular organisms is thus ultimately due to their\r\npropagation by sexual methods, seems to be further shown by certain\r\nfacts which will have to be discussed at some length in my next volume.\r\nHere, therefore, I will mention only one of them--and this because it\r\nfurnishes what appears to be another important distinction between the\r\nProtozoa and the Metazoa.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all cases where a Protozooen multiplies itself by fission, the\r\nprocess begins by a simple division of the nucleus. But when a Metazooen\r\nis developed from a germ-cell, although the process likewise begins by a\r\ndivision of the nucleus, this division is not a simple or direct one; on\r\nthe contrary, it is inaugurated by a series of processes going on within\r\nthe nucleus, which are so enormously complex, and withal so beautifully\r\nordered, that to my mind they constitute the most wonderful--if not also\r\nthe most suggestive--which have ever been revealed by microscopical\r\nresearch. It is needless to say that I refer to the phenomena of\r\nkaryokinesis. A few pages further on they will be described more fully.\r\nFor our present purposes it is sufficient to give merely a pictorial\r\nillustration of their successive phases; for a glance at such a\r\nrepresentation serves to reveal the only point to which attention has\r\nnow to be drawn--namely, the immense complexity of the processes in\r\nquestion, and therefore the contrast which they furnish to the simple\r\n(or \"direct\") division of the nucleus preparatory to cell-division in\r\nthe unicellular organisms. Here, then (Fig. 29), we see the complex\r\nprocesses of karyokinesis in the first two stages of egg-cell division.\r\nBut similar processes continue to repeat themselves in subsequent\r\nstages; and this, there is now good reason to believe, throughout _all_\r\nthe stages of cell-division, whereby the original egg-cell eventually\r\nconstructs an entire organism. In other words, all the cells composing\r\nall the tissues of a multicellular organism, at all stages of its\r\ndevelopment, are probably originated by these complex processes, which\r\ndiffer so much from the simple process of direct division in the\r\nunicellular organisms[9]. In this important respect, therefore, it does\r\nat first sight appear that we have a distinction between the Protozoa\r\nand the Metazoa of so pronounced a character, as fairly to raise the\r\nquestion whether cell-division is fundamentally identical in unicellular\r\nand in multicellular organisms.\r\n\r\n    [9] I say \"probably,\" because analogy points in this direction. As a\r\n    matter of fact, in many cases of tissue-formation karyokinesis has\r\n    not hitherto been detected. But even if in such cases it does not\r\n    occur--i. e. if failure to detect its occurrence be not due merely\r\n    to still remaining imperfections of our histological methods,--the\r\n    large number of cases in which it has been seen to occur in the\r\n    formation of sundry tissues are of themselves sufficient to indicate\r\n    some important difference between cells derived from ova (metazoal),\r\n    and cells which have not been so derived (protozoal). Which is the\r\n    point now under discussion.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Successive stages in the division of the\r\n    ovum, or egg-cell, of a worm. (After Strasburger.) _a_ to _d_ show\r\n    the changes taking place in the nucleus and surrounding\r\n    cell-contents, which result in the first segmentation of the ovum at\r\n    _e_; _f_ and _g_ show a repetition of these changes in each of the\r\n    two resulting cells, leading to the second segmentation stage at\r\n    _h_.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the only other distinction of a physiologically significant kind\r\nbetween a single cell when it occurs as a Protozooen and when it does so\r\nas the unfertilized ovum of a Metazooen is, that in the latter case the\r\nnucleus discharges from its own substance two minute protoplasmic masses\r\n(\"polar bodies\"), which are then eliminated from the cell altogether.\r\nThis process, which will be more fully described later on, appears to be\r\nof invariable occurrence in the case of all egg-cells, while nothing\r\nresembling it has ever been observed in any of the Protozoa.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider these several points of difference _seriatim_.\r\n\r\nFirst, with regard to sexual propagation, we have already seen that this\r\nis by no means the only method of propagation among the multicellular\r\norganisms; and it now remains to add that, on the other hand, there is,\r\nto say the least, a suggestive foreshadowing of sexual propagation among\r\nthe unicellular organisms. For although simple binary fission is here\r\nthe more usual mode of multiplication, very frequently two (rarely three\r\nor more) Protozoa of the same species come together, fuse into a single\r\nmass, and thus become very literally \"one flesh.\" This process of\r\n\"conjugation\" is usually (though by no means invariably) followed by a\r\nperiod of quiescent \"encystation\"; after which the contents of the cyst\r\nescape in the form of a number of minute particles, or \"spores,\" and\r\nthese severally develope into the parent type. Obviously this process of\r\nconjugation, when it is thus a preliminary to multiplication, appears to\r\nbe in its essence the same as fertilization. And if it be objected that\r\nencystation and spore-formation in the Protozoa are not always preceded\r\nby conjugation, the answer would be that neither is oviparous\r\npropagation in the Metazoa invariably preceded by fertilization.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, that there are great distinctions between true sexual\r\npropagation and this foreshadowing of it in conjugation I do not deny.\r\nThe question, however, is whether they be so great as to justify any\r\nargument against an historical continuity between them. What, then, are\r\nthese remaining distinctions? Briefly, as we have seen, they are the\r\nextrusion from egg-cells of polar bodies, and the occurrence, both in\r\negg-cells and their products (tissue-cells), of the process of\r\nkaryokinesis. But, as regards the polar bodies, it is surely not\r\ndifficult to suppose that, whatever their significance may be, it is\r\nprobably in some way or another connected with the high specialization\r\nof the functions which an egg-cell has to discharge. Nor is there any\r\ndifficulty in further supposing that, whatever purpose is served by\r\ngetting rid of polar bodies, the process whereby they are got rid of was\r\noriginally one of utilitarian development--i. e. a process which at its\r\ncommencement did not betoken any difference of kind, or breach of\r\ncontinuity, between egg-cells and cells of simpler constitution.\r\n\r\nLastly, with respect to karyokinesis, although it is true that the\r\nmicroscope has in comparatively recent years displayed this apparently\r\nimportant distinction between unicellular and multicellular organisms,\r\ntwo considerations have here to be supplied. The first is, that in some\r\nof the Protozoa processes very much resembling those of karyokinesis\r\nhave already been observed taking place in the nucleus preparatory to\r\nits division. And although such processes do not present quite the same\r\nappearances as are to be met with in egg-cells, neither do the\r\nkaryokinetic processes in tissue-cells, which in their sundry kinds\r\nexhibit great variations in this respect. Moreover, even if such were\r\nnot the case, the bare fact that nuclear division is not invariably of\r\nthe simple or direct character in the case of all Protozoa, is\r\nsufficient to show that the distinction now before us--like the one last\r\ndealt with--is by no means absolute. As in the case of sexual\r\npropagation, so in that of karyokinesis, processes which are common to\r\nall the Metazoa are not wholly without their foreshadowings in the\r\nProtozoa. And seeing how greatly exalted is the office of egg-cells--and\r\neven of tissue-cells--as compared with that of their supposed ancestry\r\nin protozoal cells, it seems to me scarcely to be wondered at if their\r\nspecializations of function should be associated with corresponding\r\npeculiarities of structure--a general fact which would in no way\r\nmilitate against the doctrine of evolution. Could we know the whole\r\ntruth, we should probably find that in order to endow the most primitive\r\nof egg-cells with its powers of marshalling its products into a living\r\narmy of cell-battalions, such an egg-cell must have been passed through\r\na course of developmental specialization of so elaborate a kind, that\r\neven the complex processes of karyokinesis are but a very inadequate\r\nexpression thereof.\r\n\r\nProbably I have now said enough to show that, remarkable and altogether\r\nexceptional as the properties of germ-cells of the multicellular\r\norganisms unquestionably show themselves to be, yet when these\r\nproperties are traced back to their simplest beginnings in the\r\nunicellular organisms, they may fairly be regarded as fundamentally\r\nidentical with the properties of living cells in general. Thus viewed,\r\nno line of real demarcation can be drawn between growth and\r\nreproduction, even of the sexual kind. The one process is, so to speak,\r\nphysiologically continuous with the other; and hence, so far as the\r\npre-embryonic stage of life-history is concerned, the facts cannot\r\nfairly be regarded as out of keeping with the theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nI will now pass on to consider the embryogeny of the Metazoa, beginning\r\nat its earliest stage in the fertilization of the ovum. And here it is\r\nthat the constructive argument in favour of evolution which is derived\r\nfrom embryology may be said properly to commence. For it is surely in\r\nitself a most suggestive fact that all the Metazoa begin their life in\r\nthe same way, or under the same form and conditions. _Omne vivum ex\r\novo._ This is a formula which has now been found to apply throughout the\r\nwhole range of the multicellular organisms. And seeing, as we have just\r\nseen, that the ovum is everywhere a single cell, the formula amounts to\r\nsaying that, physiologically speaking, every Metazooen begins its life as\r\na Protozooen, and every Metaphyton as a Protophyton[10].\r\n\r\n    [10] Even when propagated by budding, a multicellular organism has\r\n    been ultimately derived from a germ-cell.\r\n\r\nNow, if the theory of evolution is true, what should we expect to happen\r\nwhen these germ-cells are fertilized, and so enter upon their severally\r\ndistinct processes of development? Assuredly we should expect to find\r\nthat the higher organisms pass through the same phases of development as\r\nthe lower organisms, up to the time when their higher characters begin\r\nto become apparent. If in the life-history of species these higher\r\ncharacters were gained by gradual improvement upon lower characters, and\r\nif the development of the higher individual is now a general\r\nrecapitulation of that of its ancestral species, in studying this\r\nrecapitulation we should expect to find the higher organism successively\r\nunfolding its higher characters from the lower ones through which its\r\nancestral species had previously passed. And this is just what we do\r\nfind. Take, for example, the case of the highest organism, Man. Like\r\nthat of all other organisms, unicellular or multicellular, his\r\ndevelopment starts from the nucleus of a single cell. Again, like that\r\nof all the Metazoa and Metaphyta, his development starts from the\r\nspecially elaborated nucleus of an egg-cell, or a nucleus which has been\r\nformed by the fusion of a male with a female element[11]. When his\r\nanimality becomes established, he exhibits the fundamental anatomical\r\nqualities which characterize such lowly animals as polyps and\r\njelly-fish. And even when he is marked off as a Vertebrate, it cannot be\r\nsaid whether he is to be a fish, a reptile, a bird, or a beast. Later on\r\nit becomes evident that he is to be a Mammal; but not till later still\r\ncan it be said to which order of mammals he belongs.\r\n\r\n    [11] It has already been stated that both parthenogenesis and\r\n    gemmation are ultimately derived from sexual reproduction. It may\r\n    now be added, on the other hand, that the earlier stages of\r\n    parthenogenesis have been observed to occur sporadically in all\r\n    sub-kingdoms of the Metaxoa, including the Vertebrata, and even the\r\n    highest class, Mammalia. These earlier stages consist in\r\n    _spontaneous_ segmentations of the ovum; so that even if a virgin\r\n    has ever conceived and borne a son, and even if such a fact in the\r\n    human species has been unique, still it would not betoken any breach\r\n    of physiological continuity. Indeed, according to Weismann's not\r\n    improbable hypothesis touching the physiological meaning of polar\r\n    bodies, such a fact need betoken nothing more than a slight\r\n    disturbance of the complex machinery of ovulation, on account of\r\n    which the ovum failed to eliminate from its substance an almost\r\n    inconceivably minute portion of its nucleus.\r\n\r\nHere, however, we must guard against an error which is frequently met\r\nwith in popular expositions of this subject. It is not true that the\r\nembryonic phases in the development of a higher form always resemble so\r\nmany adult stages of lower forms. This may or may not be the case; but\r\nwhat always is the case is, that the embryonic phases of the higher\r\nform resemble the corresponding phases of the lower forms. Thus, for\r\nexample, it would be wrong to suppose that at any stage of his\r\ndevelopment a man resembles a jelly-fish. What he does resemble at an\r\nearly stage of his development is the essential or groundplan of the\r\njelly-fish, which that animal presents in _its_ embryonic condition, or\r\nbefore it begins to assume its more specialized characters fitting it\r\nfor its own particular sphere of life. The similarities, therefore,\r\nwhich it is the function of comparative embryology to reveal are the\r\nsimilarities of type or morphological plan: not similarities of specific\r\ndetail. Specific details may have been added to this, that, and the\r\nother species for their own special requirements, after they had\r\nseverally branched off from the common ancestral stem; and so could not\r\nbe expected to recur in the life-history of an independent specific\r\nbranch. The comparison therefore must be a comparison of embryo with\r\nembryo; not of embryos with adult forms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to give a general idea of the results thus far yielded by a\r\nstudy of comparative embryology in the present connexion, I will devote\r\nthe rest of this chapter to giving an outline sketch of the most\r\nimportant and best established of these results.\r\n\r\nHistologically the ovum, or egg-cell, is nearly identical in all\r\nanimals, whether vertebrate or invertebrate. Considered as a cell it is\r\nof large size, but actually it is not more than 1/100, and may be less\r\nthan 1/200 of an inch in diameter. In man, as in most mammals, it is\r\nabout 1/120. It is a more or less spherical body, presenting a thin\r\ntransparent envelope, called the _zona pellucida_, which\r\ncontains--first, the protoplasmic cell-substance or \"yolk,\" within which\r\nlies, second, the nucleus or germinal vesicle, within which again lies,\r\nthird, the nucleolus or germinal spot. This description is true of the\r\negg-cells of all animals, if we add that in the case of the lowest\r\nanimals--such as sponges, &c.--there is no enveloping membrane: the\r\negg-cell is here a naked cell, and its constituent protoplasm, being\r\nthus unconfined, is free to perform protoplasmic movements, which it\r\ndoes after the manner, and with all the activity, of an amoeba. But\r\neven with respect to this matter of an enveloping membrane, there is no\r\nessential difference between an ovum of the lowest and an ovum of the\r\nhighest animals. For in their early stages of development within the\r\novary the ova of the highest animals are likewise in the condition of\r\nnaked cells, exhibiting amoebiform movements; the enveloping membrane\r\nof an ovum being the product of a later development. Moreover this\r\nmembrane, when present, is usually provided with one or more minute\r\napertures, through which the spermatozooen passes when fertilizing the\r\novum. It is remarkable that the spermatozoa know, so to speak, of the\r\nexistence of these gate-ways,--their snake-like movements being directed\r\ntowards them, presumably by a stimulus due to some emanation\r\ntherefrom[12]. In the mammalian ovum, however, these apertures are\r\nexceedingly minute, and distributed all round the circumference of the\r\npellucid envelope, as represented in this illustration (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\n    [12] The spermatozooids of certain plants can be strongly attracted\r\n    towards a pipette which is filled with malic acid--crowding around\r\n    and into it with avidity.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Ovarian ovum of a Mammal, (_a_) magnified\r\n    and viewed under pressure, (_b_) burst by increased pressure, with\r\n    yolk and nucleus escaping: (_c_) the nucleus more freed from\r\n    yolk-substance. (From _Quain's Anatomy_, after Allen Thomson.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Amoeboid movements of young egg-cells, _a_,\r\n    Amoeboid ovum of _Hydra_ (from Balfour, after Kleitnenberg); _b_,\r\n    early ovum of _Toxopneustes variegatus_, with pseudopodia-like\r\n    processes (from Balfour, after Selenka); _c_, ovum of _Toxopneustes\r\n    lividus_, more nearly ripe (from Balfour, Hertwig).

The egg\r\nof a bird, for example, is the egg-cell, _plus_ an enormous aggregation\r\nof nutritive material, an egg-shell, and sundry other structures suited\r\nto the subsequent development of the egg-cell when separated from the\r\nparent's body. But all these accessories are, from our present point of\r\nview, accidental or adventitious. What we have now to understand by the\r\novum, the egg, or the egg-cell, is the microscopical germ which I have\r\njust described. So far then as this germ is concerned, we find that all\r\nmulticellular organisms begin their existence in the same kind of\r\nstructure, and that this structure is anatomically indistinguishable\r\nfrom that of the permanent form presented by the lowest, or unicellular\r\norganisms. But although anatomically indistinguishable, physiologically\r\nthey present the sundry peculiarities already mentioned.\r\n\r\nNow I have endeavoured to show that none of these peculiarities are such\r\nas to exclude--or even so much as to invalidate--the supposition of\r\ndevelopmental continuity between the lowest egg-cells and the highest\r\nprotozoal cells. It remains to show in this place, and on the other\r\nhand, that there is no breach of continuity between the lowest and the\r\nhighest egg-cells; but, on the contrary, that the remarkable uniformity\r\nof the complex processes whereby their peculiar characters are exhibited\r\nto the histologist, is such as of itself to sustain the doctrine of\r\ncontinuity in a singularly forcible manner. On this account, therefore,\r\nand also because the facts will again have to be considered in another\r\nconnexion when we come to deal with Weismann's theory of heredity, I\r\nwill here briefly describe the processes in question.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the young egg-cell multiplies itself by simple\r\nbinary division, after the manner of unicellular organisms in\r\ngeneral--thereby indicating, as also by its amoebiform movements, its\r\nfundamental identity with such organisms in kind. But, as we have\r\nlikewise seen, when the ovum ceases to resemble these organisms, by\r\ntaking on its higher degree of functional capacity, it is no longer able\r\nto multiply itself in this manner. On the contrary, its cell-divisions\r\nare now of an endogenous character, and result in the formation of many\r\ndifferent kinds of cells, in the order required for constructing the\r\nmulticellular organism to which the whole series of processes eventually\r\ngive rise. We have now to consider these processes _seriatim_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Stages in the formation of the polar bodies\r\n    in the ovum of a star-fish. (After Hertwig.) _g.v._, germinal\r\n    vesicle transformed into a spindle-shaped system of fibres; _p.'_,\r\n    the first polar body becoming extruded; _p._, _p._, both polar\r\n    bodies fully extruded; _f. pn._, female pronucleus, or residue of\r\n    the germinal vesicle.]\r\n\r\nFirst of all the nucleus discharges its polar bodies, as previously\r\nmentioned, and in the manner here depicted on the previous page. (Fig.\r\n33.) It will be observed that the nucleus of the ovum, or the germinal\r\nvesicle as it is called, gets rid first of one and afterwards of the\r\nother polar body by an \"indirect,\" or karyokinetic, process of division.\r\n(Fig. 33.) Extrusion of these bodies from the ovum (or it may be only\r\nfrom the nucleus) having been accomplished, what remains of the nucleus\r\nretires from the circumference of the ovum, and is called the female\r\npronucleus. (Fig. 33. _f. pn._) The ovum is now ready for fertilization.\r\nA similar emission of nuclear substance is said by some good observers\r\nto take place also from the male germ-cell, or spermatozooen, at or about\r\nthe close of _its_ development. The theories to which these facts have\r\ngiven rise will be considered in future chapters on Heredity.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the mechanism of fertilization, the diagrams (Figs. 34,\r\n35) represent what happens in the case of star-fish.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Fertilization of the ovum of an echinoderm.\r\n    (From _Quain's Anatomy_, after Selenka.)

Brit._ after Fol.) A, spermatozoa in the\r\n    mucilaginous coat of the ovum; a prominence is rising from the\r\n    surface of the ovum towards a spermatozooen; B, they have almost met;\r\n    C, they have met; D, the spermatozooen enters the ovum through a\r\n    distinct opening; H, the entire ovum, showing extruded polar bodies\r\n    on its upper surface, and the moving together of the male and female\r\n    pronuclei; E, F, G, meeting and coalescence of the pronuclei.]\r\n\r\nThe sperm-cell, or spermatozooen, is seen in the act of penetrating the\r\novum. In the first figure it has already pierced the mucilaginous coat\r\nof the ovum, the limit of which is represented by a line through which\r\nthe tail of the spermatozooen is passing: the head of the spermatozooen is\r\njust entering the ovum proper. It may be noted that, in the case of many\r\nanimals, the general protoplasm of the ovum becomes aware, so to speak,\r\nof the approach of a spermatozooen, and sends up a process to meet it.\r\n(Fig. 35, A, B, C.) Several--or even many--spermatozoa may thus enter\r\nthe coat of the ovum; but normally only one proceeds further, or right\r\ninto the substance of the ovum, for the purpose of effecting\r\nfertilization. This spermatozooen, as soon as it enters the periphery of\r\nthe yolk, or cell-substance proper, sets up a series of remarkable\r\nphenomena. First, its own head rapidly increases in size, and takes on\r\nthe appearance of a cell-nucleus: this is called the male pronucleus. At\r\nthe same time its tail begins to disappear, and the enlarged head\r\nproceeds to make its way directly towards the nucleus of the ovum which,\r\nas before stated, is now called the female pronucleus. The latter in its\r\nturn moves towards the former, and when the two meet they fuse into one\r\nmass, forming a new nucleus. Before the two actually meet, the\r\nspermatozooen has lost its tail altogether; and it is noteworthy that\r\nduring its passage through the protoplasmic cell-contents of the ovum,\r\nit appears to exercise upon this protoplasm an attractive influence; for\r\nthe granules of the latter in its vicinity dispose themselves around it\r\nin radiating lines. All these various phenomena are depicted in the\r\nabove wood-cuts. (Figs. 34, 35.)\r\n\r\nFertilization having been thus effected by fusion of the male and female\r\npronuclei into a single (or new) nucleus, this latter body proceeds to\r\nexhibit complicated processes of karyokinesis, which, as before shown,\r\nare preliminary to nuclear division in the case of egg-cells. Indeed the\r\nkaryokinetic process may begin in both the pronuclei before their\r\njunction is effected; and, even when their junction is effected, it does\r\nnot appear that complete fusion of the so-called chromatin elements of\r\nthe two pronuclei takes place. For the purpose of explaining what this\r\nmeans, and still more for the purpose of giving a general idea of the\r\nkaryokinetic processes as a whole, I will quote the following\r\ndescription of them, because, for terseness combined with lucidity, it\r\nis unsurpassable.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--Karyokinesis of a typical tissue-cell\r\n    (epithelium of Salamander). (After Flemming and Klein.) The series\r\n    from A to I represents the successive stages in the movement of the\r\n    chromatin fibres during division, excepting G, which represents the\r\n    \"nucleus-spindle\" of an egg-cell. A, resting nucleus; D,\r\n    wreath-form; E, single star, the loops of the wreath being broken;\r\n    F, separation of the star into two groups of U-shaped fibres; H,\r\n    diaster or double star; I, completion of the cell-division and\r\n    formation of two resting nuclei. In G the chromatin fibres are\r\n    marked _a_, and correspond to the \"equatorial plate\"; _b_,\r\n    achromatin fibres forming the nucleus-spindle; _c_, granules of the\r\n    cell-protoplasm forming a \"polar star.\" Such a polar star is seen at\r\n    each end of the nucleus-spindle, and is not to be confused with the\r\n    diaster H, the two ends of which are composed of _chromatin_.]\r\n\r\n     Researches, chiefly due to Flemming, have shown that the nucleus in\r\n     very many tissues of higher plants and animals consists of a\r\n     capsule containing a plasma of \"achromatin,\" not deeply stained by\r\n     re-agents, ramifying in which is a reticulum of \"chromatin\"\r\n     consisting of fibres which readily take a deep stain. (Fig. 36, A).\r\n     Further it is demonstrated that, when the cell is about to divide\r\n     into two, definite and very remarkable movements take place in the\r\n     nucleus, resulting in the disappearance of the capsule and in the\r\n     arrangement of its fibres first in the form of a wreath (D), and\r\n     subsequently (by the breaking of the loops formed by the fibres) in\r\n     the form of a star (E). A further movement within the nucleus leads\r\n     to an arrangement of the broken loops in two groups (F), the\r\n     position of the open ends of the broken loops being reversed as\r\n     compared with what previously obtained. Now the two groups diverge,\r\n     and in many cases a striated appearance of the achromatin substance\r\n     between the two groups of chromatin loops is observable (H). In\r\n     some cases (especially egg-cells) this striated arrangement of the\r\n     achromatin is then termed a \"nucleus-spindle,\" and the group of\r\n     chromatin loops (G, _a_) is known as \"the equatorial plate.\" At\r\n     each end of the nucleus-spindle in these cases there is often seen\r\n     a star consisting of granules belonging to the general protoplasm\r\n     of the cell (G, _c_). These are known as \"polar stars.\" After the\r\n     separation of the two sets of loops (H) the protoplasm of the\r\n     general substance of the cell becomes constricted, and division\r\n     occurs, so as to include a group of chromatin loops in each of the\r\n     two fission products. Each of these then rearranges itself together\r\n     with the associated chromatin into a nucleus such as was present in\r\n     the mother cell to commence with (I)[13].\r\n\r\n    [13] Ray Lankester, _Encyclop. Brit._, 9th ed., Vol. XIX, pp. 832-3.\r\n\r\nSince the above was published, however, further progress has been made.\r\nIn particular it has been found that the chromatin fibres pass from\r\nphase D to phase F by a process of longitudinal splitting (Fig. 37 _g_,\r\n_h_; Fig. 38, VI, VII)--which is a point of great importance for\r\nWeismann's theory of heredity,--and that the protoplasm outside the\r\nnucleus seems to take as important a part in the karyokinetic process as\r\ndoes the nuclear substance. For the so-called \"attraction-spheres\" (Fig.\r\n38 II _a_, III, III _a_, VIII to XII), which were at first supposed to\r\nbe of subordinate importance in the process as a whole, are now known to\r\ntake an exceedingly active part in it (see especially IX to XI). Lastly,\r\nit may be added that there is a growing consensus of authoritative\r\nopinion, that the chromatin fibres are the seats of the material of\r\nheredity, or, in other words, that they contain those essential elements\r\nof the cell which endow the daughter-cells with their distinctive\r\ncharacters. Therefore, where the parent-cell is an ovum, it follows from\r\nthis view that all hereditary qualities of the future organism are\r\npotentially present in the ultra-microscopical structure of the\r\nchromatin fibres.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Study of successive changes taking place in\r\n    the nucleus of an epithelium cell, preparatory to division of the\r\n    cell.

But as in relation to this purpose the illustrations\r\nspeak for themselves, I may now pass on at once to the history of\r\nembryonic development, which follows fertilization of the ovum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen that when the new nucleus of the fertilized ovum (which is\r\nformed by a coalescence of the male pronucleus with the female) has\r\ncompleted its karyokinetic processes, it is divided into two equal\r\nparts; that these are disposed at opposite poles of the ovum; and that\r\nthe whole contents of the ovum are thereupon likewise divided into two\r\nequal parts, with the result that there are now two nucleated cells\r\nwithin the spherical wall of the ovum where before there had only been\r\none. Moreover, we have also seen that a precisely similar series of\r\nevents repeat themselves in each of these two cells, thus giving rise to\r\nfour cells (see Fig. 29). It must now be added that such duplication is\r\ncontinued time after time, as shown in the accompanying illustrations\r\n(Figs. 39, 40).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Segmentation of ovum. (After Haeckel.)\r\n    Successive stages are marked by the letters A, B, C. D represents\r\n    several stages in advance of C.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--The contents of an ovum in an advanced\r\n    stage of segmentation, drawn in perspective. (After Haeckel.)]\r\n\r\nAll this, it will be noticed, is a case of cell-multiplication, which\r\ndiffers from that which takes place in the unicellular organisms only in\r\nits being _invariably_ preceded (as far as we know) by karyokinesis, and\r\nin the resulting cells being all confined within a common envelope, and\r\nso in not being free to separate. Nevertheless, from what has already\r\nbeen said, it will also be noticed that this feature makes all the\r\ndifference between a Metazooen and a Protozooen; so that already the ovum\r\npresents the distinguishing character of a Metazooen.\r\n\r\nI have dealt thus at considerable length upon the processes whereby the\r\noriginally unicellular ovum and spermatozooen become converted into the\r\nmulticellular germ, because I do not know of any other exposition of the\r\nargument from Embryology where this, the first stage of the argument,\r\nhas been adequately treated. Yet it is evident that the fact of all the\r\nprocesses above described being so similar in the case of sexual (or\r\nmetazoal) reproduction among the innumerable organisms where it occurs,\r\nconstitutes in itself a strong argument in favour of evolution. For the\r\nmechanism of fertilization, and all the processes which even thus far we\r\nhave seen to follow therefrom, are hereby shown to be not only highly\r\ncomplex, but likewise highly specialized. Therefore, the remarkable\r\nsimilarity which they present throughout the whole animal kingdom--not\r\nto speak of the vegetable--is expressive of organic continuity, rather\r\nthan of absolute discontinuity in every case, as the theory of special\r\ncreation must necessarily suppose. And it is evident that this argument\r\nis strong in proportion to the uniformity, the specialization, and the\r\ncomplexity of the processes in question.\r\n\r\nHaving occupied so much space with supplying what appear to me the\r\ndeficiencies in previous expositions of the argument from Embryology, I\r\ncan now afford to take only a very general view of the more important\r\nfeatures of this argument as they are successively furnished by all the\r\nlater stages of individual development. But this is of little\r\nconsequence, seeing that from the point at which we have now arrived\r\nprevious expositions of the argument are both good and numerous. The\r\nfollowing then is to be regarded as a mere sketch of the evidences of\r\nphyletic (or ancestral) evolution, which are so abundantly furnished by\r\nall the subsequent phases of ontogenetic (or individual) evolution.\r\n\r\nThe multicellular body which is formed by the series of segmentations\r\nabove described is at first a sphere of cells (Fig. 40). Soon, however,\r\na watery fluid gathers in the centre, and progressively pushes the cells\r\ntowards the circumference, until they there constitute a single layer.\r\nThe ovum, therefore, is now in the form of a hollow sphere containing\r\nfluid, confined within a continuous wall of cells (Fig. 41 A). The next\r\nthing that happens is a pitting in of one portion of the sphere (B). The\r\npit becomes deeper and deeper, until there is a complete invagination of\r\nthis part of the sphere--the cells which constitute it being\r\nprogressively pushed inwards until they come into contact with those at\r\nthe opposite pole of the ovum. Consequently, instead of a hollow sphere\r\nof cells, the ovum now becomes an open sac, the walls of which are\r\ncomposed of a double layer of cells (C). The ovum is now what has been\r\ncalled a gastrula; and it is of importance to observe that probably all\r\nthe Metazoa pass through this stage. At any rate it has been found to\r\noccur in all the main divisions of the animal kingdom, as a glance at\r\nthe accompanying figures will serve to show (Fig. 42)[14]. Moreover many\r\nof the lower kinds of Metazoa never pass beyond it; but are all their\r\nlives nothing else than gastrulae, wherein the orifice becomes the mouth\r\nof the animal, the internal or invaginated layer of cells the stomach,\r\nand the outer layer the skin. So that if we take a child's india-rubber\r\nball, of the hollow kind with a hole in it, and push in one side with\r\nour fingers till internal contact is established all round, by then\r\nholding the indented side downwards we should get a very fair anatomical\r\nmodel of a gastraea form, such as is presented by the adult condition of\r\nmany of the most primitive Metazoa--especially the lower\r\n_Coelenterata_. The preceding figures represent two other such forms\r\nin nature, the first locomotive and transitory, the second fixed and\r\npermanent (Figs. 43, 44).\r\n\r\n    [14] In most vertebrated animals this process of gastrulation has\r\n    been more or less superseded by another, which is called\r\n    delamination; but it scarcely seems necessary for our present\r\n    purposes to describe the latter. For not only does it eventually\r\n    lead to the same result as gastrulation--i. e. the converting of the\r\n    ovum into a double-walled sac,--but there is good evidence among the\r\n    lower Vertebrata of its being preceded by gastrulation; so that,\r\n    even as to the higher Vertebrata, embryologists are pretty well\r\n    agreed that delamination has been but a later development of, or\r\n    possibly improvement upon, gastrulation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Formation of the gastrula of _Amphioxus_.\r\n    (After Kowalevsky.)

They differ from the transitory stage of other\r\nMetazoa only in being enormously larger (owing to greatly further\r\n_growth_, without any further _development_ as to matters of fundamental\r\nimportance), and in having sundry tentacles and other organs added later\r\non to meet their special requirements. The point to remember is, that in\r\nall cases a gastrula is an open sac composed of two layers of cells--the\r\nouter layer being called the ectoderm, and the inner the endoderm. They\r\nhave also been called the animal layer and the vegetative layer, because\r\nit is the outer layer (ectoderm) that gives rise to all the organs of\r\nsensation and movement--viz. the skin, the nervous system, and the\r\nmuscular system; while it is the inner layer (endoderm) that gives rise\r\nto all the organs of nutrition and reproduction. It is desirable only\r\nfurther to explain that gastrulation does not take place in all the\r\nMetazoa after exactly the same plan. In different lines of descent\r\nvarious and often considerable modifications of the original and most\r\nsimple plan have been introduced; but I will not burden the present\r\nexposition by describing these modifications[15]. It is enough for us\r\nthat they always end in the formation of the two primary layers of\r\nectoderm and endoderm.\r\n\r\n    [15] The most extreme of them is that which is mentioned in the last\r\n    foot-note.\r\n\r\nThe next stage of differentiation is common to all the Metazoa, except\r\nthose lowest forms which, as we have just seen, remain permanently as\r\nlarge gastrulae, with sundry specialized additions in the way of\r\ntentacles, &c. This stage of differentiation consists in the formation\r\nof either a pouch or an additional layer between the ectoderm and the\r\nendoderm, which is called the mesoderm. It is probably in most cases\r\nderived from the endoderm, but the exact mode of its derivation is still\r\nsomewhat obscure. Sometimes it has the appearance of itself constituting\r\ntwo layers; but it is needless to go into these details; for in any case\r\nthe ultimate result is the same--viz. that of converting the Metazooen\r\ninto the form of a tube, the walls of which are composed of concentric\r\nlayers of cells. The outermost layer afterwards gives rise to the\r\nepidermis with its various appendages, and also to the central nervous\r\nsystem with its organs of special sense. The median layer gives rise to\r\nthe voluntary muscles, bones, cartilages, &c., the nutritive systems of\r\nthe blood, the chyle, the lymph, and the muscular tube of the intestine.\r\nLastly, the innermost layer developes into the epithelium lining of the\r\nintestine, with its various appendages of liver, lungs, intestinal\r\nglands, &c.\r\n\r\nI have just said that this three or four layered stage is shared by all\r\nthe Metazoa, except those very lowest forms--such as sponges and\r\njelly-fish--which do not pass on to it. But from this point the\r\ndevelopmental histories of all the main branches of the Metazoa\r\ndiverge--the Vermes, the Echinodermata, the Mollusca, the Articulata,\r\nand the Vertebrata, each taking a different road in their subsequent\r\nevolution. I will therefore confine attention to only one of these\r\nseveral roads or methods, namely, that which is followed by the\r\nVertebrata--observing merely that, if space permitted, the same\r\nprinciples of progressive though diverging histories of evolution would\r\nequally well admit of being traced in all the other sub-kingdoms which\r\nhave just been named.\r\n\r\nIn order to trace these principles in the case of the Vertebrata, it is\r\ndesirable first of all to obtain an idea of the anatomical features\r\nwhich most essentially distinguish the sub-kingdom as a whole. The\r\nfollowing, then, is what may be termed the ideal plan of vertebrate\r\norganization, as given by Prof. Haeckel. First, occupying the major axis\r\nof body we perceive the primitive vertebral column. The parts lying\r\nabove this axis are those which have been developed from the ectoderm\r\nand mesoderm--viz. voluntary muscles, central nervous system, and organs\r\nof special sense. The parts lying below this axis are for the most part\r\nthose which have been developed from the endoderm--namely, the\r\ndigestive tract with its glandular appendages, the circulating system\r\nand the respiratory system. In transverse section, therefore, the ideal\r\nvertebrate consists of a solid axis, with a small tube occupied by the\r\nnervous system above, and a large tube, or body-cavity, below. This\r\nbody-cavity contains the viscera, breathing organs, and heart, with its\r\nprolongations into the main blood-vessels of the organism. Lastly, on\r\neither side of the central axis are to be found large masses of\r\nmuscle--two on the dorsal and two on the ventral. As yet, however, there\r\nare no limbs, nor even any bony skeleton, for the primitive vertebral\r\ncolumn is hitherto unossified cartilage. This ideal animal, therefore,\r\nis to all appearance as much like a worm as a fish, and swims by means\r\nof a lateral undulation of its whole body, assisted, perhaps, by a\r\ndorsal fin formed out of skin.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Ideal primitive vertebrate, seen from the\r\n    left side.

For there\r\nstill survives what must be an immensely archaic form of vertebrate,\r\nwhose anatomy is almost identical with that of the imaginary type which\r\nhas just been described. I allude, of course, to _Amphioxus_, which is\r\nby far the most primitive or generalized type of vertebrated animal\r\nhitherto discovered. Indeed, we may say that this remarkable creature is\r\nalmost as nearly allied to a worm as it is to a fish. For it has no\r\nspecialized head, and therefore no skull, brain, or jaws: it is\r\ndestitute alike of limbs, of a centralized heart, of developed liver,\r\nkidneys, and, in short, of most of the organs which belong to the other\r\nVertebrata. It presents, however, a rudimentary backbone, in the form of\r\nwhat is called a notochord. Now a primitive dorsal axis of this kind\r\noccurs at a very early period of embryonic life in all vertebrated\r\nanimals; but, with the exception of _Amphioxus_, in all other existing\r\nVertebrata this structure is not itself destined to become the permanent\r\nor bony vertebral column. On the contrary, it gives way to, or is\r\nreplaced by, this permanent bony structure at a later stage of\r\ndevelopment. Consequently, it is very suggestive that so distinctively\r\nembryonic a structure as this temporary cartilaginous axis of all the\r\nother known Vertebrata should be found actually persisting to the\r\npresent day as the permanent axis of _Amphioxus_. In many other\r\nrespects, likewise, the early embryonic history of other Vertebrata\r\nrefers us to the permanent condition of _Amphioxus_. In particular, we\r\nmust notice that the wall of the neck is always perforated by what in\r\n_Amphioxus_ are the gill-openings, and that the blood-vessels as they\r\nproceed from the heart are always distributed in the form of what are\r\ncalled gill-arches, adapted to convey the blood round or through the\r\ngills for the purpose of aeration. In all existing fish and other\r\ngill-breathing Vertebrata, this arrangement is permanent. It is\r\nlikewise met with in a peculiar kind of worm, called _Balanoglossus_--a\r\ncreature so peculiar, indeed, that it has been constituted by Gegenbaur\r\na class all by itself. We can see by the wood-cuts that it presents a\r\nseries of gill-slits, like the homologous parts of the fishes with which\r\nit is compared--i. e. fishes of a comparatively low type of\r\norganization, which dates from a time before the development of external\r\ngills. (Figs. 48, 49, 50.) Now, as I have already said, these\r\ngill-_slits_ are supported internally by the gill-_arches_, or the\r\nblood-vessels which convey the blood to be oxygenized in the branchial\r\napparatus (see below, Figs. 51, 52, 53); and the whole arrangement is\r\ndeveloped from the anterior part of the intestine--as is likewise the\r\nrespiratory mechanism of all the gill-breathing Vertebrata. That so\r\nclose a parallel to this peculiar mechanism should be met with in a\r\nworm, is a strong additional piece of evidence pointing to the\r\nderivation of the Vertebrata from the Vermes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 48.--_Balanoglossus_.

Agassiz.) _r_,\r\n    proboscis; _h_, collar; _k_, gill-slits; _d_, digestive posterior\r\n    intestine; _v_, intestinal vessel; _a_, anus.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--A large Sea-lamprey (_Petromyzon marinus_),\r\n    much reduced in size.

The gill-arches, _a a' a''_, and _b b' b''_,\r\n    are called aortic arches in air-breathing vertebrata.]\r\n\r\nWell, I have just said that in all the gill-breathing Vertebrata, this\r\nmechanism of gill-slits and vascular gill-arches in the front part of\r\nthe intestinal tract is permanent. But in the air-breathing Vertebrata\r\nsuch an arrangement would obviously be of no use. Consequently, the\r\ngill-slits in the sides of the neck (see Figs. 16 and 57, 58), and the\r\ngill-arches of the large blood-vessels (Figs. 54, 55, 56), are here\r\nexhibited only as transitory phases of development. But as such they\r\noccur in all air-breathing Vertebrata. And, as if to make the homologies\r\nas striking as possible, at the time when the gill-slits and the\r\ngill-arches are developed in the embryonic young of air-breathing\r\nVertebrata, the heart is constructed upon the fish-like type. That is to\r\nsay, it is placed far forwards, and, from having been a simple tube as\r\nin Worms, is now divided into two chambers, as in Fish. Later on it\r\nbecomes progressively pushed further back between the developing lungs,\r\nwhile it progressively acquires the three cavities distinctive of\r\nAmphibia, and finally the four cavities belonging only to the complete\r\ndouble circulation of Birds and Mammals. Moreover, it has now been\r\nsatisfactorily shown that the lungs of air-breathing Vertebrata, which\r\nare thus destined to supersede the function of gills, are themselves the\r\nmodified swim-bladder or float, which belongs to Fish. Consequently, all\r\nthese progressive modifications in the important organs of circulation\r\nand respiration in the air-breathing Vertebrata, together make up as\r\ncomplete a history of their aquatic pedigree as it would be possible for\r\nthe most exacting critic to require.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 54.--Ideal diagram, of primitive gill-or\r\n    aortic-arches.

Even without any anatomical\r\ndissection, the similarity of all vertebrated embryos at comparable\r\nstages of development admits of being strikingly shown, if we merely\r\nplace the embryos one beside the other. Here, for instance, are the\r\nembryos of a fish, a salamander, a tortoise, a bird, and four different\r\nmammals. In each case three comparable stages of development are\r\nrepresented. Now, if we read the series horizontally, we can see that\r\nthere is very little difference between the eight animals at the\r\nearliest of the three stages represented--all having fish-like tails,\r\ngill-slits, and so on. In the next stage further differentiation has\r\ntaken place, but it will be observed that the limbs are still so\r\nrudimentary that even in the case of Man they are considerably shorter\r\nthan the tail. But in the third stage the distinctive characters are\r\nwell marked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much then for an outline sketch of the main features in the embryonic\r\nhistory of the Vertebrata. But it must be remembered that the science of\r\ncomparative embryology extends to each of the other three great branches\r\nof the tree of life, where these take their origin, through the worms,\r\nfrom the still lower, or gastraea, forms. And in each of these three\r\ngreat branches--namely, the Echinodermata, the Mollusca, and the\r\nArthropoda--we have a repetition of just the same kind of evidence in\r\nfavour of continuous descent, with adaptive modification in sundry\r\nlines, as that which I have thus briefly sketched in the case of the\r\nVertebrata. The roads are different, but the method of travelling is the\r\nsame. Moreover, when the embryology of the Worms is closely studied, the\r\norigin of these different roads admits of being clearly traced. So that\r\nwhen all this mass of evidence is taken together, we cannot wonder that\r\nevolutionists should now regard the science of comparative embryology as\r\nthe principal witness to their theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPALAEONTOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present Chapter will be devoted to a consideration of the evidence\r\nof organic evolution which has been furnished by the researches of\r\ngeologists. On account of its direct or historical nature, this branch\r\nof evidence is popularly regarded as the most important--so much so,\r\nindeed, that in the opinion of most educated persons the whole doctrine\r\nof organic evolution must stand or fall according to the so-called\r\n\"testimony of the rocks.\" Now, without at all denying the peculiar\r\nimportance of this line of evidence, I must begin by remarking that it\r\ndoes not present the denominating importance which popular judgment\r\nassigns to it. For although popular judgment is right in regarding the\r\ntestimony of the rocks as of the nature of a history, this judgment, as\r\na rule, is very inadequately acquainted with the great imperfections of\r\nthat history. Knowing in a general way what magnificent advances the\r\nscience of geology has made during the present century, the public mind\r\nis more or less imbued with the notion, that because we now possess a\r\ntolerably complete record of the chronological succession of geological\r\nformations, we must therefore possess a correspondingly complete record\r\nof the chronological succession of the forms of life which from time to\r\ntime have peopled the globe. Now in one sense this notion is partly\r\ntrue, but in another sense it is profoundly false. It is partly true if\r\nwe have regard only to those larger divisions of the vegetable or animal\r\nkingdoms which naturalists designate by the terms classes and orders.\r\nBut the notion becomes progressively more untrue when it is applied to\r\nfamilies and genera, while it is most of all untrue when applied to\r\nspecies. That this must be so may be rendered apparent by two\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it does not follow that because we have a tolerably\r\ncomplete record of the succession of geological formations, we have\r\ntherefore any correspondingly complete record of their fossiliferous\r\ncontents. The work of determining the relative ages of the rocks does\r\nnot require that every cubic mile of the earth's surface should be\r\nseparately examined, in order to find all the different fossils which it\r\nmay contain. Were this the case, we should hitherto have made but very\r\nsmall progress in our reading of the testimony of the rocks. The\r\nrelative ages of the rocks are determined by broad comparative surveys\r\nover extensive areas; and although the identification of widely\r\nseparated deposits is often greatly assisted by a study of their\r\nfossiliferous contents, the mere pricking of a continent here and there\r\nis all that is required for this purpose. Hence, the accuracy of our\r\ninformation touching the relative ages of geological strata does not\r\ndepend upon--and, therefore, does not betoken--any equivalent accuracy\r\nof knowledge touching the fossiliferous material which these strata may\r\nat the present time actually contain. And, as we well know, the\r\nopportunities which the geologist has of discovering fossils are\r\nextremely limited, if we consider these opportunities in relation to the\r\narea of geological formations. The larger portion of the earth's surface\r\nis buried beneath the sea; and much the larger portion of the\r\nfossiliferous deposits on shore are no less hopelessly buried beneath\r\nthe land. Therefore it is only upon the fractional portion of the\r\nearth's surface which at the present time happens to be actually exposed\r\nto his view that the geologist is able to prosecute his search for\r\nfossils. But even here how miserably inadequate this search has hitherto\r\nbeen! With the exception of a scratch or two in the continents of Asia\r\nand America, together with a somewhat larger number of similar scratches\r\nover the continent of Europe, even that comparatively small portion of\r\nthe earth's surface which is available for the purpose has been hitherto\r\nquite unexplored by the palaeontologist. How enormously rich a store of\r\nmaterial remains to be unearthed by the future scratchings of this\r\nsurface, we may dimly surmise from the astonishing world of bygone life\r\nwhich is now being revealed in the newly discovered fossiliferous\r\ndeposits on the continent of America.\r\n\r\nBut, besides all this, we must remember, in the second place, that all\r\nthe fossiliferous deposits in the world, even if they could be\r\nthoroughly explored, would still prove highly imperfect, considered as a\r\nhistory of extinct forms of life. In order that many of these forms\r\nshould have been preserved as fossils, it is necessary that they should\r\nhave died upon a surface neither too hard nor too soft to admit of their\r\nleaving an impression; that this surface should afterwards have\r\nhardened sufficiently to retain the impression; that it should then have\r\nbeen protected from the erosion of water, as well as from the\r\ndisintegrating influence of the air; and yet that it should not have\r\nsunk far enough beneath the surface to have come within the no less\r\ndisintegrating influence of subterranean heat. Remembering thus, as a\r\ngeneral rule, how many conditions require to have met before a fossil\r\ncan have been both formed and preserved, we must conclude that the\r\ngeological record is probably as imperfect in itself as are our\r\nopportunities of reading even the little that has been recorded. If we\r\nspeak of it as a history of the succession of life upon the planet, we\r\nmust allow, on the one hand, that it is a history which merits the name\r\nof a \"chapter of accidents\"; and, on the other hand, that during the\r\nwhole course of its compilation pages were being destroyed as fast as\r\nothers were being formed, while even of those that remain it is only a\r\nword, a line, or at most a short paragraph here and there, that we are\r\npermitted to see. With so fragmentary a record as this to study, I do\r\nnot think it is too much to say that no conclusions can be fairly based\r\nupon it, merely from the absence of testimony. Only if the testimony\r\nwere positively opposed to the theory of descent, could any argument be\r\nfairly raised against that theory on the grounds of this testimony. In\r\nother words, if any of the fossils hitherto discovered prove the order\r\nof succession to have been incompatible with the theory of genetic\r\ndescent, then the record may fairly be adduced in argument, because we\r\nshould then be in possession of definite information of a positive\r\nkind, instead of a mere absence of information of any kind. But if the\r\nadverse argument reaches only to the extent of maintaining that the\r\ngeological record does not furnish us with so complete a series of\r\n\"connecting links\" as we might have expected, then, I think, the\r\nargument is futile. Even in the case of human histories, written with\r\nthe intentional purpose of conveying information, it is an unsafe thing\r\nto infer the non-occurrence of an event from a mere silence of the\r\nhistorian--and this especially in matters of comparatively small detail,\r\nsuch as would correspond (in the present analogy) to the occurrence of\r\n_species_ and _genera_ as connecting links. And, of course, if the\r\nhistory had only come down to us in fragments, no one would attach any\r\nimportance at all to what might have been only the _apparent_ silence of\r\nthe historian.\r\n\r\nIn view, then, of the unfortunate imperfection of the geological record\r\n_per se_, as well as of the no less unfortunate limitation of our means\r\nof reading even so much of the record as has come down to us, I conclude\r\nthat this record can only be fairly used in two ways. It may fairly be\r\nexamined for positive testimony against the theory of descent, or for\r\nproof of the presence of organic remains of a high order of development\r\nin a low level of strata. And it may be fairly examined for negative\r\ntestimony, or for the absence of connecting links, if the search be\r\nconfined to the larger taxonomic divisions of the fauna and flora of the\r\nworld. The more minute these divisions, the more restricted must have\r\nbeen the areas of their origin, and hence the less likelihood of their\r\nhaving been preserved in the fossil state, or of our finding them even\r\nif they have been. Therefore, if the theory of evolution is true, we\r\nought not to expect from the geological record a full history of\r\n_specific_ changes in any but at most a comparatively small number of\r\ninstances, where local circumstances happen to have been favourable for\r\nthe writing and preservation of such a history. But we might reasonably\r\nexpect to find a general concurrence of geological testimony to the\r\nlarger fact--namely, of there having been throughout all geological time\r\na uniform progression as regards the larger taxonomic divisions. And, as\r\nI will next proceed to show, this is, in a general way, what we do find,\r\nalthough not altogether without some important exceptions, with which I\r\nshall deal in an Appendix.\r\n\r\nThere is no _positive_ proof _against_ the theory of descent to be drawn\r\nfrom a study of palaeontology, or proof of the presence of any kind of\r\nfossils in strata where the fact of their presence is incompatible with\r\nthe theory of evolution. On the other hand, there is an enormous body of\r\nuniform evidence to prove two general facts of the highest importance in\r\nthe present connexion. The first of these general facts is, that an\r\nincrease in the diversity of types both of plants and animals has been\r\nconstant and progressive from the earliest to the latest times, as we\r\nshould anticipate that it must have been on the theory of descent in\r\never-ramifying lines of pedigree. And the second general fact is, that\r\nthrough all these branching lines of ever-multiplying types, from the\r\nfirst appearance of each of them to their latest known conditions, there\r\nis overwhelming evidence of one great law of organic nature--the law of\r\ngradual advance from the general to the special, from the low to the\r\nhigh, from the simple to the complex.\r\n\r\nNow, the importance of these large and general facts in the present\r\nconnexion must be at once apparent; but it may perhaps be rendered more\r\nso if we try to imagine how the case would have stood supposing\r\ngeological investigation to have yielded in this matter an opposite\r\nresult, or even so much as an equivocal result. If it had yielded an\r\nopposite result, if the lower geological formations were found to\r\ncontain as many, as diverse, and as highly organized types as the later\r\ngeological formations, clearly there would have been no room at all for\r\nany theory of progressive evolution. And, by parity of reasoning, in\r\nwhatever degree such a state of matters were found to prevail, in that\r\ndegree would the theory in question have been discredited. But seeing\r\nthat these opposite principles do not prevail in any (relatively\r\nspeaking) considerable degree[16], we have so far positive testimony of\r\nthe largest and most massive character in favour of this theory. For\r\nwhile all these large and general facts are very much what they ought to\r\nbe according to this theory, they cannot be held to lend any support at\r\nall to the rival theory. In other words, it is clearly no essential part\r\nof the theory of special creation that species should everywhere exhibit\r\nthis gradual multiplication as to number, coupled with a gradual\r\ndiversification and general elevation of types, in all the growing\r\nbranches of the tree of life. No one could adopt seriously the jocular\r\nlines of Burns, to the effect that the Creator required to practise his\r\nprentice hand on lower types before advancing to the formation of\r\nhigher. Yet, without some such assumption, it would be impossible to\r\nexplain, on the theory of independent creations, why there should have\r\nbeen this gradual advance from the few to the many, from the general to\r\nthe special, from the low to the high.\r\n\r\n    [16] For objections which may be brought against this and similar\r\n    statements, see the Appendix.\r\n\r\n +---+--------------------------+---------------------------------------\r\n |   |_Epochs and Formations._  |_Faunal Characters._\r\n |C  |                          |\r\n |a  |--------------------------+---------------------------------------\r\n |i  |POST-PLIOCENE.            |Man.

Therefore, if I do not further enlarge upon the evidence\r\nwhich we here have, as it were _en masse_, it is only because I do not\r\nfeel that any words could add to its obvious significance. It may best\r\nbe allowed to speak for itself in the millions of facts which are\r\ncondensed in this tabular statement of the order of succession of all\r\nthe known forms of animal life, as presented by the eminent\r\npalaeontologist, Professor Cope[17].\r\n\r\n    [17] For difficulties and objections, see Appendix.\r\n\r\nOr, taking a still more general survey, this tabular statement may be\r\nstill further condensed, and presented in a diagrammatic form, as it has\r\nbeen by another eminent American palaeontologist, Prof. Le Conte, in his\r\nexcellent little treatise on _Evolution and its Relations to Religious\r\nThought_. The following is his diagrammatic representation, with his\r\nremarks thereon.\r\n\r\n     When each ruling class declined in importance, it did not perish,\r\n     but continued in a subordinate position. Thus, the whole organic\r\n     kingdom became not only higher and higher in its highest forms, but\r\n     also more and more complex in its structure and in the interaction\r\n     of its correlated parts. The whole process and its result is\r\n     roughly represented in the accompanying diagram, in which A B\r\n     represents the course of geological time, and the curve, the rise,\r\n     culmination, and decline of successive dominate classes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Diagram of Geological Succession of the\r\n    Classes of the Animal Kingdom. (After Le Conte.)]\r\n\r\nI will here leave the evidence which is thus yielded by the most general\r\nprinciples that have been established by the science of palaeontology;\r\nand I will devote the rest of this chapter to a detailed consideration\r\nof a few highly special lines of evidence. By thus suddenly passing from\r\none extreme to the other, I hope to convey the best idea that can be\r\nconveyed within a brief compass of the minuteness, as well as the\r\nextent, of the testimony which is furnished by the rocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Darwin first published his _Origin of Species_, adverse critics\r\nfastened upon the \"missing-link\" argument as the strongest that they\r\ncould bring against the theory of descent. Although Darwin had himself\r\nstrongly insisted on the imperfection of the geological record, and the\r\nconsequent precariousness of any negative conclusions raised upon it,\r\nthese critics maintained that he was making too great a demand upon the\r\nargument from ignorance--that, even allowing for the imperfection of the\r\nrecord, they would certainly have expected at least a few cases of\r\ntestimony to _specific_ transmutation. For, they urged in effect,\r\nlooking to the enormous profusion of the extinct species on the one\r\nhand, and to the immense number of known fossils on the other, it was\r\nincredible that no satisfactory instances of specific transmutation\r\nshould ever have been brought to light, if such transmutation had ever\r\noccurred in the universal manner which the theory was bound to suppose.\r\nBut since Darwin first published his great work palaeontologists have\r\nbeen very active in discovering and exploring fossiliferous beds in\r\nsundry parts of the world; and the result of their labours has been to\r\nsupply so many of the previously missing links that the voice of\r\ncompetent criticism in this matter has now been well-nigh silenced.\r\nIndeed, the material thus furnished to an advocate of evolution at the\r\npresent time is so abundant that his principal difficulty is to select\r\nhis samples. I think, however, that the most satisfactory result will be\r\ngained if I restrict my exposition to a minute account of some few\r\nseries of connecting links, rather than if I were to take a more general\r\nsurvey of a larger number. I will, therefore, confine the survey to the\r\nanimal kingdom, and there mention only some of the cases which have\r\nyielded well-detailed proof of continuous differentiation.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the parts of animals most likely to have been\r\npreserved in such a continuous series of fossils as the present line of\r\nevidence requires, would have been the hard parts. These are horns,\r\nbones, teeth, and shells. Therefore I will consider each of these four\r\nclasses of structures separately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHorns wherever they occur, are found to be of high importance for\r\npurposes of classification. They are restricted to the Ruminants, and\r\nappear under three different forms or types--namely solid, as in\r\nantelopes; hollow, as in sheep; and deciduous, as in deer. Now, in each\r\nof these divisions we have a tolerably complete palaeontological history\r\nof the evolution of horns. The early ruminants were altogether hornless\r\n(Fig. 60). Then, in the middle Miocene, the first antelopes appeared\r\nwith tiny horns, which progressively increased in size among the\r\never-multiplying species of antelopes until the present day. But it is\r\nin the deer tribe that we meet with even better evidence touching the\r\nprogressive evolution of horns; because here not only size, but shape,\r\nis concerned. For deer's horns, or antlers, are arborescent; and hence\r\nin their case we have an opportunity of reading the history, not only of\r\na progressive growth in size, but also of an increasing development of\r\nform. Among the older members of the tribe, in the lower Miocene, there\r\nare no horns at all. In the mid-Miocene we meet with two-pronged horns\r\n(_Cervus dicrocerus_, Figs. 61, 62, 1/5 nat. size). Next, in the upper\r\nMiocene (_C. matheronis_, Fig. 63, 1/8 nat. size), and extending into\r\nthe Pliocene (_C. pardinensis_, Fig. 64, 1/18 nat. size), we meet with\r\nthree-pronged horns. Then, in the Pliocene we find also four-pronged\r\nhorns (_C. issiodorensis_, Fig. 65, 1/16 nat. size), leading us to\r\nfive-pronged (_C. tetraceros_). Lastly, in the Forest-bed of Norfolk we\r\nmeet with arborescent horns (_C. Sedgwickii_, Fig. 66, 1/35 nat. size).\r\nThe life-history of existing stags furnishes a parallel development\r\n(Fig. 67), beginning with a single horn (which has not yet been found\r\npalaeontologically), going on to two prongs, three prongs, four prongs,\r\nand afterwards branching.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 60.--Skull of _Oreodon Culbertsoni_. (After\r\n    Leidy.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGS. 61-66. The series is reduced from Gaudry's\r\n    illustrations, after Farge, Croizet, Jobert and Boyd Dawkins.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 67.--Successive stages in the development of an\r\n    existing Deer's Antlers. (After Gaudry, but a better illustration\r\n    has already been given on p. 100.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nComing now to bones, we have a singularly complete record of transition\r\nfrom one type or pattern of structure to another in the phylogenetic\r\nhistory of tails. This has been so clearly and so tersely conveyed by\r\nProf. Le Conte, that I cannot do better than quote his statement.\r\n\r\n     It has long been noticed that there are among fishes two styles of\r\n     tail-fins. These are the even-lobed, or homocercal (Fig. 68), and\r\n     the uneven-lobed, or heterocercal (Fig. 69). The one is\r\n     characteristic of ordinary fishes (teleosts), the other of sharks\r\n     and some other orders. In structure the difference is even more\r\n     fundamental than in form. In the former style the backbone stops\r\n     abruptly in a series of short, enlarged joints, and thence sends\r\n     off rays to form the tail-fin (Fig. 68); in the latter the\r\n     backbone runs through the fin to its very point, growing slenderer\r\n     by degrees, and giving off rays above and below from each joint,\r\n     but the rays on the lower side are much longer (Fig. 69). This type\r\n     of fin is, therefore, _vertebrated_, the other _non-vertebrated_.\r\n     Figs. 68 and 69 show these two types in form and structure. But\r\n     there is still another type found only in the lowest and most\r\n     generalized forms of fishes. In these the tail-fin is vertebrated\r\n     and yet symmetrical. This type is shown in Fig. 70.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 68.--Homocercal Tail, showing (A) external form\r\n     and (B) internal structure.]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 69.--Heterocercal Tail, showing (A) external\r\n     form and (B) internal structure.]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 70.--Vertebrated but symmetrical fin\r\n     (diphycercal), showing (A) external form and (B) internal\r\n     structure.]\r\n\r\n     Now, in the development of a teleost fish (Fig. 68), as has been\r\n     shown by Alexander Agassiz, the tail-fin is first like Fig. 70;\r\n     then becomes heterocercal, like Fig. 69; and, finally, becomes\r\n     homocercal like Fig. 68. Why so? Not because there is any special\r\n     advantage in this succession of forms; for the changes take place\r\n     either in the egg or else in very early embryonic states. The\r\n     answer is found in the fact that _this is the order of change in\r\n     the phylogenetic series_. The earliest fish-tails were either like\r\n     Fig. 69 or Fig. 70; never like Fig. 68. The earliest of all were\r\n     almost certainly like Fig. 70; then they became like Fig. 69; and,\r\n     finally, only much later in geological history (Jurassic or\r\n     Cretaceous), they became like Fig. 68. This order of change is\r\n     still retained in the embryonic development of the last introduced\r\n     and most specialized order of existing fishes. The family history\r\n     is repeated in the individual history.\r\n\r\n     Similar changes have taken place in the form and structure of\r\n     birds' tails. The earliest bird known--the Jurassic\r\n     _Archaeopteryx_--had a long reptilian tail of twenty-one joints,\r\n     each joint bearing a feather on each side, right and left (Fig.\r\n     71): [see also Fig. 73]. In the typical modern bird, on the\r\n     contrary, the tail-joints are diminished in number, shortened up,\r\n     and enlarged, and give out long feathers, fan-like, to form the\r\n     so-called tail (Fig. 72). The _Archaeopteryx'_ tail is\r\n     _vertebrated_, the typical bird's _non-vertebrated_. This\r\n     shortening up of the tail did not take place at once, but\r\n     gradually. The Cretaceous birds, intermediate in time, had tails\r\n     intermediate in structure. The _Hesperornis_ of Marsh had twelve\r\n     joints. At first--in Jurassic strata--the tail is fully a half of\r\n     the whole vertebral column. It then gradually shortens up until it\r\n     becomes the aborted organ of typical modern birds. Now, in\r\n     embryonic development, the tail of the modern typical bird _passes\r\n     through all these stages_. At first the tail is nearly one half the\r\n     whole vertebral column; then, as development goes on, while the\r\n     rest of the body grows, the growth of the tail stops, and thus\r\n     finally becomes the aborted organ we now find. The ontogeny still\r\n     passes through the stages of the phylogeny. The same is true of all\r\n     tailless animals.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 71.--Tail of _Archaeopteryx_. A indicates origin\r\n     of simply-jointed tail.]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 72.--Tail of modern Bird. The numerals indicate\r\n     the foreshortened, enlarged, and consolidated joints; _f_, terminal\r\n     segment of the vertebral column; D, shafts of feathers.]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 73.--_Archaeopteryx macura_, restored, 1/2 nat.\r\n     size. (After Flower.) The section of the tail is copied from Owen,\r\n     nat. size.]\r\n\r\nThe extinct _Archaeopteryx_ above alluded to presents throughout its\r\nwhole organization a most interesting assemblage of \"generalized\r\ncharacters.\" For example, its teeth, and its still unreduced digits of\r\nthe wings (which, like those of the feet, are covered with scales),\r\nrefer us, with almost as much force as does the vertebrated tail, to the\r\nSauropsidian type--or the trunk from which birds and reptiles have\r\ndiverged.\r\n\r\nWe will next consider the palaeontological evidence which we now\r\npossess of the evolution of mammalian limbs, with special reference to\r\nthe hoofed animals, where this line of evidence happens to be most\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nI may best begin by describing the bones as these occur in the sundry\r\nbranches of the mammalian type now living. As we shall presently see,\r\nthe modifications which the limbs have undergone in these sundry\r\nbranches chiefly consist in the suppression of some parts and the\r\nexaggerated development of others. But, by comparing all mammalian limbs\r\ntogether, it is easy to obtain a generalized type of mammalian limb,\r\nwhich in actual life is perhaps most nearly conformed to in the case of\r\nbears. I will therefore choose the bear for the purpose of briefly\r\nexpounding the bones of mammalian limbs in general--merely asking it to\r\nbe understood, that although in the case of many other mammalia some of\r\nthese bones may be dwindled or altogether absent, while others may be\r\ngreatly exaggerated as to relative size, in no case do any _additional_\r\nbones appear.\r\n\r\nOn looking, then, at the skeleton of a bear (Fig. 74), the first thing\r\nto observe is that there is a perfect serial homology between the bones\r\nof the hind legs and of the fore legs. The thigh-bone, or femur,\r\ncorresponds to the shoulder-bone, or humerus; the two shank bones (tibia\r\nand fibula) correspond to the two arm-bones (radius and ulna); the many\r\nlittle ankle-bones (tarsals) correspond to the many little wrist-bones\r\n(carpals); the foot-bones (meta-tarsals) correspond to the hand-bones\r\n(meta-carpals); and, lastly, the bones of each of the toes correspond to\r\nthose of each of the fingers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Skeleton of Polar Bear, drawn from nature\r\n    (_Brit. Mus._).]\r\n\r\nThe next thing to observe is, that the disposition of bones in the case\r\nof the bear is such that the animal walks in the way that has been\r\ncalled plantigrade. That is to say, all the bones of the fingers, as\r\nwell as those of the toes, feet, and ankles, rest upon the ground, or\r\nhelp to constitute the \"soles.\" Our own feet are constructed on a\r\nclosely similar pattern. But in the majority of living mammalian forms\r\nthis is not the case. For the majority of mammals are what has been\r\ncalled digitigrade. That is to say, the bones of the limb are so\r\ndisposed that both the foot and hand bones, and therefore also the ankle\r\nand wrist, are removed from the ground altogether, so that the animal\r\nwalks exclusively upon its toes and fingers--as in the case of this\r\nskeleton (Fig. 75), which is the skeleton of a lion. The next figures\r\ndisplay a series of limbs, showing the progressive passage of a\r\ncompletely plantigrade into a highly digitigrade type--the curved lines\r\nof connexion serving to indicate the homologous bones (Figs. 76, 77).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Fig_. 75.--Skeleton of Lion. (After Huxley.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Anterior limb of Man, Dog, Hog, Sheep, and\r\n    Horse. (After Le Conte.) _Sc_, shoulder-blade; _c_, coracoid; _a_,\r\n    _b_, bones of fore-arm; 5, bones of the wrist; 6, bones of the hand;\r\n    7, bones of the fingers.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Posterior limb of Man, Monkey, Dog, Sheep\r\n    and Horse. (After Le Conte.) 1, Hip-joint; 2, thigh-bone; 3,\r\n    knee-joint; 4, bones of leg; 5, ankle-joint; 6, bones of foot; 7,\r\n    bones of toes.]\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to detail the history of mammalian limbs, as this has\r\nbeen recorded for us in fossil remains.\r\n\r\nThe most generalized or primitive types of limb hitherto discovered in\r\nany vertebrated animal above the class of fishes, are those which are\r\nmet with in some of the extinct aquatic reptiles. Here, for instance, is\r\na diagram of the left hind limb of _Baptanodon discus_ (Fig. 78). It has\r\nsix rows of little symmetrical bones springing from a leg-like origin.\r\nBut the whole structure resembles the fin of a fish about as nearly as\r\nit does the leg of a mammal. For not only are there six rows of bones,\r\ninstead of five, suggestive of the numerous rays which characterise the\r\nfin of a fish; but the structure as a whole, having been covered over\r\nwith blubber and skin, was throughout flexible and unjointed--thus in\r\nfunction, even more than in structure, resembling a fin. In this\r\nrespect, also, it must have resembled the paddle of a whale (see Fig.\r\n79); but of course the great difference will be noted, that the paddle\r\nof a whale reveals the dwindled though still clearly typical bones of a\r\ntrue mammalian limb; so that although in outward form and function these\r\ntwo paddles are alike, their inward structure clearly shows that while\r\nthe one testifies to the absence of evolution, the other testifies to\r\nthe presence of degeneration. If the paddle of _Baptanodon_ had occurred\r\nin a whale, or the paddle of a whale had occurred in _Baptanodon_,\r\neither fact would in itself have been well-nigh destructive of the whole\r\ntheory of evolution.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 78.--A, posterior limb of _Baptanodon discus_.\r\n    (After Marsh.) F, thigh-bone; I to VI, undifferentiated bones of the\r\n    leg and foot. B, anterior limb of _Chelydra serpentina_. (After\r\n    Gegenbaur.) U and R, bones of the fore-arm; I to V, fully\r\n    differentiated bones of the hand, following those of the wrist.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 79.--Paddle of a Whale.]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the most generalized as it is the most ancient type of\r\nvertebrate limb above the class of fishes. Obviously it is a type\r\nsuited only to aquatic life. Consequently, when aquatic Vertebrata began\r\nto become terrestrial, the type would have needed modification in order\r\nto serve for terrestrial locomotion. In particular, it would have needed\r\nto gain in consolidation and in firmness, which means that it would have\r\nneeded also to become jointed. Accordingly, we find that this archaic\r\ntype gave place in land-reptiles to the exigencies of these\r\nrequirements. Here for example is a diagram, copied from Gegenbaur, of\r\nthe right fore-foot of _Chelydra serpentina_ (Fig. 78). As compared with\r\nthe homologous limb of its purely aquatic predecessor, there is to be\r\nnoticed the disappearance of one of the six rows of small bones, a\r\nconfluence of some of the remainder in the other five rows, a\r\nduplication of the arm-bone into a radius and ulna, in order to admit of\r\njointed rotation of the hand, and a general disposition of the small\r\nbones below these arm-bones, which clearly foreshadows the joint of the\r\nwrist. Indeed, in this fore-foot of _Chelydra_, a child could trace all\r\nthe principal homologies of the mammalian counterpart, growing, like the\r\nnext stage in a dissolving view, out of the primitive paddle of\r\n_Baptanodon_--namely, first the radius and ulna, next the carpals, then\r\nthe meta-carpals, and, lastly, the three phalanges in each of the five\r\ndigits.\r\n\r\nSuch a type of foot no doubt admirably meets the requirements of slow\r\nreptilian locomotion over swampy ground. But for anything like rapid\r\nlocomotion over hard and uneven ground, greater modifications would be\r\nneeded. Such modifications, however, need not be other in kind: it is\r\nenough that they should continue in the same line of advance, so as to\r\nreach a higher degree of firmness, combined with better joints.\r\nAccordingly we find that this took place, not indeed among reptiles,\r\nwhose habits of cold-blooded life have not changed, but among their\r\nwarm-blooded descendants, the mammals. Moreover, when we examine the\r\nwhole mammalian series, we find that the required modifications must\r\nhave taken place in slightly different ways in three lines of descent\r\nsimultaneously. We have first the plantigrade and digitigrade\r\nmodifications already mentioned (pp. 178, 179) Of these the plantigrade\r\nwalking entailed least change, because most resembling the ancestral or\r\nlizard-like mode of progression. All that was here needed was a general\r\nimprovement as to relative lengths of bones, with greater consolidation\r\nand greater flexibility of joints. Therefore I need not say anything\r\nmore about the plantigrade division. But the digitigrade modification\r\nnecessitated a change of structural plan, to the extent of raising the\r\nwrist and ankle joints off the ground, so as to make the quadruped walk\r\non its fingers and toes. We meet with an interesting case of this\r\ntransition in the existing hare, which while at rest supports itself on\r\nthe whole hind foot after the manner of a plantigrade animal, but when\r\nrunning does so upon the ends of its toes, after the manner of a\r\ndigitigrade animal.\r\n\r\nIt is of importance for us to note that this transition from the\r\noriginal plantigrade to the more recent digitigrade type, has been\r\ncarried out on two slightly different plans in two different lines of\r\nmammalian descent. The hoofed mammals--which are all digitigrade--are\r\nsub-classified as artiodactyls and perissodactyls, i. e. even-toed and\r\nodd-toed. Now, whether an animal has an even or an odd number of toes\r\nmay seem a curiously artificial distinction on which to found so\r\nimportant a classification of the mammalian group. But if we look at the\r\nmatter from a less empirical and more intelligent point of view, we\r\nshall see that the alternative of having an even or an odd number of\r\ntoes carries with it alternative consequences of a practically important\r\nkind to any animal of the digitigrade type. For suppose an aboriginal\r\nfive-toed animal, walking on the ends of its five toes, to be called\r\nupon to resign some of his toes. If he is left with an even number, it\r\nmust be two or four; and in either case the animal would gain the\r\nfirmest support by so disposing his toes as to admit of the axis of his\r\nfoot passing between an equal number of them--whether it be one or two\r\ntoes on each side. On the other hand, if our early mammal were called\r\nupon to retain an odd number of toes, he would gain best support by\r\nadjusting matters so that the axis of his foot should be coincident with\r\nhis middle toe, whether this were his only toe, or whether he had one on\r\neither side of it. This consideration shows that the classification into\r\neven-toed and odd-toed is not so artificial as it no doubt at first\r\nsight appears. Let us, then, consider the stages in the evolution of\r\nboth these types of feet.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the reptile _Chelydra_, it will be observed that the axis\r\nof the foot passes down the middle toe, which is therefore supported by\r\ntwo toes on either side (Fig. 78). It may also be noticed that the wrist\r\nor ankle bones do not interlock, either with one another or with the\r\nbones of the hand or foot below them. This, of course, would give a\r\nweak foot, suited to slow progression over marshy ground--which, as we\r\nhave seen, was no doubt the origin of the mammalian plantigrade foot.\r\nHere, for instance, to all intents and purposes, is a similar type of\r\nfoot, which belonged to a very early mammal, antecedent to the elephant\r\nseries, the horse series, the rhinoceros, the hog, and, in short, all\r\nthe known hoofed mammalia (Fig. 80). It was presumably an inhabitant of\r\nswampy ground, slow in its movements, and low in its intelligence.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 80.--Fossil skeleton of _Phenacodus primavus_.\r\n    (After Cope.)]\r\n\r\nBut now, as we have seen, for more rapid progression on hard uneven\r\nground, a stronger and better jointed foot would be needed. Therefore we\r\nfind the bones of the wrist and ankle beginning to interlock, both among\r\nthemselves and also with those of the foot and hand immediately below\r\nthem. Such a stage of evolution is still apparent in the now existing\r\nelephant. (See Fig. 81.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 81.--Bones of the foot of four different forms\r\n    of the perissodactyl type, showing gradual reduction in the number\r\n    of digits, coupled with a greater consolidation of the bones above\r\n    the digits. The series reads from right to left. Drawn from nature\r\n    (_Brit. Mus._).]\r\n\r\nNext, however, a still stronger foot was made by the still further\r\ninterlocking of the wrist and ankle bones, so that both the first and\r\nsecond rows of them were thus fitted into each other, as well as into\r\nthe bones of the hand and foot beneath. This further modification is\r\nclearly traceable in some of the earlier perissodactyls, and occurs in\r\nthe majority at the present time. Compare, for example, the greater\r\ninterlocking and consolidation of these small bones in the Rhinoceros as\r\ncontrasted with the Elephant (Fig. 81). Moreover, simultaneously with\r\nthese consolidating improvements in the mechanism of the wrist and ankle\r\njoints, or possibly at a somewhat later period, a reduction in the\r\nnumber of digits began to take place. This was a continuation of the\r\npolicy of consolidating the foot, analogous to the dropping out of the\r\nsixth row of small bones in the paddle of _Baptanodon_. (Fig. 78.) In\r\nthe pentadactyl plantigrade foot of the early mammals, the first digit,\r\nbeing the shortest, was the first to leave the ground, to dwindle,\r\nand finally to disappear. More work being thus thrown on the remaining\r\nfour, they were strengthened by interlocking with the wrist (or ankle)\r\nbones above them, as just mentioned; and also by being brought closer\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 82.--Bones of the foot of four different forms\r\n    of the artiodactyl type, showing gradual reduction of the number of\r\n    digits, coupled with a greater consolidation of the bones above the\r\n    digits. The series reads from right to left. Drawn from nature\r\n    (_Brit. Mus._).]\r\n\r\nThe changes which followed I will render in the words of Professor\r\nMarsh.\r\n\r\n     Two kinds of reduction began. One leading to the existing\r\n     perissodactyl foot, and the other, apparently later, resulting in\r\n     the artiodactyl type. In the former the axis of the foot remained\r\n     in the middle of the third digit, as in the pentadactyl foot. [See\r\n     Fig. 81.] In the latter, it shifted to the outer side of this\r\n     digit, or between the third and fourth toe. [See Fig. 82.]\r\n\r\n     In the further reduction of the perissodactyl foot, the fifth\r\n     digit, being shorter than the remaining three, next left the\r\n     ground, and gradually disappeared. [Fig. 81 B.] Of the three\r\n     remaining toes, the middle or axial one was the longest, and\r\n     retaining its supremacy as greater strength and speed were\r\n     required, finally assumed the chief support of the foot [Fig. 81\r\n     C], while the outer digits left the ground, ceased to be of use,\r\n     and were lost, except as splint-bones [Fig. 81 D]. The feet of the\r\n     existing horse shows the best example of this reduction in the\r\n     Perissodactyls, as it is the most specialized known in the\r\n     Ungulates [Fig. 81 D].\r\n\r\n     In the artiodactyl foot, the reduction resulted in the gradual\r\n     diminution of the two outer of the four remaining toes, the third\r\n     and fourth doing all the work, and thus increasing in size and\r\n     power. The fifth digit, for the same reasons as in the\r\n     perissodactyl foot, first left the ground and became smaller. Next,\r\n     the second soon followed, and these two gradually ceased to be\r\n     functional, [and eventually disappeared altogether, as shown in the\r\n     accompanying drawing of the feet of still existing animals, Fig. 82\r\n     B, C, D].\r\n\r\n     The limb of the modern race-horse is a nearly perfect piece of\r\n     machinery, especially adapted to great speed on dry, level ground.\r\n     The limb of an antelope, or deer, is likewise well fitted for\r\n     rapid motion on a plain, but the foot itself is adapted to rough\r\n     mountain work as well, and it is to this advantage, in part, that\r\n     the Artiodactyls owe their present supremacy. The plantigrade\r\n     pentadactyl foot of the primitive Ungulate--and even the\r\n     perissodactyl foot that succeeded it--both belong to the past humid\r\n     period of the world's history. As the surface of the earth slowly\r\n     dried up, in the gradual desiccation still in progress, new types\r\n     of feet became a necessity, and the horse, antelope, and camel were\r\n     gradually developed, to meet the altered conditions.\r\n\r\nThe best instance of such progressive modifications in the case of\r\nperissodactyl feet is furnished by the fossil pedigree of the existing\r\nhorse, because here, within the limits of the same continuous family\r\nline, we have presented the entire series of modifications.\r\n\r\nThere are now known over thirty species of horse-like creatures,\r\nbeginning from the size of a fox, then progressively increasing in bulk,\r\nand all standing in linear series in structure as in time. Confining\r\nattention to the teeth and feet, it will be seen from the wood-cut on\r\npage 189 that the former grow progressively longer in their sockets, and\r\nalso more complex in the patterns of their crowns. On the other hand,\r\nthe latter exhibit a gradual diminution of their lateral toes, together\r\nwith a gradual strengthening of the middle one. (See Fig. 83.) So that\r\nin the particular case of the horse-ancestry we have a practically\r\ncomplete chain of what only a few years ago were \"missing links.\" And\r\nthis now practically completed chain shows us the entire history of what\r\nhappens to be the most peculiar, or highly specialized, limb in the\r\nwhole mammalian class--namely, that of the existing horse. Of the other\r\ntwo wood-cuts, the former (Fig. 84) shows the skeleton of a very early\r\nand highly generalized ancestor, while the other is a partial\r\nrestoration of a much more recent and specialized one. (Fig. 85.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 83.--Feet and teeth in fossil pedigree of the\r\n    Horse. (After Marsh.) _a_, bones of the fore-foot; _b_, bones of the\r\n    hind-foot; _c_, radius and ulna; _d_, tibia and fibula; _e_, roots\r\n    of a tooth; _f_ and _g_, crowns of upper and lower molar teeth.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 84.--_Palaeotherium_. (Lower Tertiary of Paris\r\n    Basin.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 85.--_Hipparion_. (New World Pliocene.)]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, progressive modifications of the artiodactyl feet may\r\nbe traced geologically up to the different stages presented by living\r\nruminants, in some of which it has proceeded further than in others. For\r\ninstance, if we compare the pig, the deer, and the camel (Fig. 82), we\r\nimmediately perceive that the dwindling of the two rudimentary digits\r\nhas proceeded much further in the case of the deer than in that of the\r\npig, and yet not so far as in that of the camel, seeing that here they\r\nhave wholly disappeared. Moreover, complementary differences are to be\r\nobserved in the degree of consolidation presented by the two useful\r\ndigits. For while in the pig the two foot-bones are still clearly\r\ndistinguishable throughout their entire length, in the deer, and still\r\nmore in the camel, their union is more complete, so that they go to\r\nconstitute a single bone, whose double or compound character is\r\nindicated externally only by a slight bifurcation at the base.\r\nNevertheless, if we examine the state of matters in the unborn young of\r\nthese animals, we find that the two bones in question are still\r\nseparated throughout their length, and thus precisely resemble what used\r\nto be their permanent condition in some of the now fossil species of\r\nhoofed mammalia.\r\n\r\nTurning next from bones of the limb to other parts of the mammalian\r\nskeleton, let us briefly consider the evidence of evolution that is here\r\nlikewise presented by the vertebral column, the skull, and the teeth.\r\n\r\nAs regards the vertebral column, if we examine this structure in any of\r\nthe existing hoofed animals, we find that the bony processes called\r\nzygapophyses, which belong to each of the constituent vertebrae, are so\r\narranged that the anterior pair belonging to each vertebra interlocks\r\nwith the posterior pair belonging to the next vertebra. In this way the\r\nwhole series of vertebrae are connected together in the form of a chain,\r\nwhich, while admitting of considerable movement laterally, is everywhere\r\nguarded against dislocation. But if we examine the skeletons of any\r\nungulates from the lower Eocene deposits, we find that in no case is\r\nthere any such arrangement to secure interlocking. In all the hoofed\r\nmammals of this period the zygapophyses are flat. Now, from this flat\r\ncondition to the present condition of full interlocking we obtain a\r\ncomplete series of connecting links. In the middle Miocene period we\r\nfind a group of hoofed animals in which the articulation begins by a\r\nslight rounding of the previously flat surfaces: later on this rounding\r\nprogressively increases, until eventually we get the complete\r\ninterlocking of the present time.\r\n\r\nAs regards teeth, and still confining attention to the hoofed mammals,\r\nwe find that low down in the geological series the teeth present on\r\ntheir grinding surfaces only three simple tubercles. Later on a fourth\r\ntubercle is added, and later still there is developed that complicated\r\nsystem of ridges and furrows which is characteristic of these teeth at\r\nthe present time, and which was produced by manifold and various\r\ninvolutions of the three or four simple tubercles of Eocene and lower\r\nMiocene times. In other words, the principle of gradual improvement in\r\nthe construction of teeth, which has already been depicted as regards\r\nthe particular case of the Horse-family (Fig. 83), is no less apparent\r\nin the pedigree of all the other mammalia, wherever the palaeontological\r\nhistory is sufficiently intact to serve as a record at all.\r\n\r\nLastly, as regards the skull, casts of the interior show that all the\r\nearlier mammals had small brains with comparatively smooth or\r\nunconvoluted surfaces; and that as time went on the mammalian brain\r\ngradually advanced in size and complexity. Indeed so small were the\r\ncerebral hemispheres of the primitive mammals that they did not overlap\r\nthe cerebellum, while their smoothness must have been such as in this\r\nrespect to have resembled the brain of a bird or reptile. This, of\r\ncourse, is just as it ought to be, if the brain, which the skull has to\r\naccommodate, has been gradually evolved into larger and larger\r\nproportions in respect of its cerebral hemispheres, or the upper masses\r\nof it which constitute the seat of intelligence. Thus, if we look at the\r\nabove series of wood-cuts, which represents the comparative structure of\r\nthe brain in the existing classes of the Vertebrata, we can immediately\r\nunderstand why the fossil skulls of Mammalia should present a gradual\r\nincrease in size and furrowing, so as to accommodate the general\r\nincrease of the brain in both these respects between the level marked\r\n\"maml\" and that marked \"man,\" in the last of the diagrams. (Fig. 87.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 86.--Comparative series of Brains. (After Le\r\n    Conte.) The series reads from above downwards, and represents\r\n    diagrammatically the brain of a Fish, a Reptile, a Bird, a Mammal,\r\n    and a Man. In each case the letter A marks a side view, and the\r\n    letter B a top view. The small italics throughout signify the\r\n    following homologous parts: _m_, medulla; _cb_, cerebellum; _op_,\r\n    optic lobes; _cr_, cerebrum and thalamus; _ol_, olfactory lobes. The\r\n    series shows a progressive consolidation and enlargement of the\r\n    brain in general, and of the cerebrum and cerebellum in particular,\r\n    which likewise exhibit continually advancing structure in respect of\r\n    convolution. In the case of Man, these two parts of the brain have\r\n    grown to so great a size that they conceal all the other parts from\r\n    the superficial points of view represented in the diagram.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 87.--Ideal section through all the above stages.\r\n    (After Le Conte.])\r\n\r\nThe tabular statement on the following diagram, which I borrow from\r\nProf. Cope, will serve at a glance to reveal the combined significance\r\nof so many lines of evidence, united within the limits of the same group\r\nof animals.\r\n\r\nTo give only one special illustration of the principle of evolution as\r\nregards the skull, here is one of the most recent instances that has\r\noccurred of the discovery of a missing link, or connecting form (see\r\nFig. 88). The fossil (B), which was found in New Jersey, stands in an\r\nintermediate position between the stag and the elk. In the stag (A) the\r\nskull is high, showing but little of that anterior attenuation which is\r\nsuch a distinctive feature of the skull of the elk (C). The nasal bones\r\n(N) of the former, again, are remarkably long when compared with the\r\nsimilar bones of the latter, and the premaxillaries (PMX), instead of\r\nbeing projected forward along the horizontal plane of the base of the\r\nskull, are deflected sharply downward.

Nowhere do we meet with any\r\ndeviation or ambiguity, while everywhere we encounter similar proofs of\r\ncontinuous transformation--proofs which vary only with the varying\r\namount of material which happens to be at our disposal, being most\r\nnumerous and detailed in those cases where the greatest number of fossil\r\nforms has been preserved by the geological record. Here, therefore, we\r\nmay leave the vertebral skeleton; and, having presented a sample of the\r\nevidence as yielded by horns and bones, I will conclude by glancing with\r\nsimilar brevity at the case of shells--which, as before remarked,\r\nconstitute the only other sufficiently hard or permanent material to\r\nyield unbroken evidence touching the fossil ancestry of animals.\r\n\r\nOf course it will be understood that I am everywhere giving merely\r\nsamples of the now superabundant evidence which is yielded by\r\npalaeontology; and, as this chapter is already a long one, I must content\r\nmyself with citing only the case of mollusk-shells, although shells of\r\nother classes might be made to yield highly important additions to the\r\ntestimony. Moreover, even as regards the one division of mollusk-shells,\r\nI can afford to quote only a very few cases. These, however, are in my\r\nopinion the strongest single pieces of evidence in favour of\r\ntransmutation which have thus far been brought to light.\r\n\r\nNear the village of Steinheim, in Wuertemberg, there is an ancient\r\nlake-basin, dating from Tertiary times. The lake has long ago dried up;\r\nbut its aqueous deposits are extraordinarily rich in fossil shells,\r\nespecially of different species of the genus _Planorbis_. The following\r\nis an authoritative _resume_ of the facts.\r\n\r\n     As the deposits seem to have been continuous for ages, and the\r\n     fossil shells very abundant, this seemed to be an excellent\r\n     opportunity to test the theory of derivation. With this end in\r\n     view, they have been made the subject of exhaustive study by\r\n     Hilgendorf in 1866, and by Hyatt in 1880. In passing from the\r\n     lowest to the highest strata the species change greatly and many\r\n     times, the extreme forms being so different that, were it not for\r\n     the intermediate forms, they would be called not only different\r\n     species, but different genera. And yet the gradations are so\r\n     insensible that the whole series is nothing less than a\r\n     demonstration, in this case at least, of origin of species by\r\n     derivation with modifications. The accompanying plate of successive\r\n     forms (Fig. 89), which we take from Prof. Hyatt's admirable memoir,\r\n     will show this better than any mere verbal explanation. It will be\r\n     observed that, commencing with four slight varieties--probably\r\n     sexually isolated varieties--of one species, each series shows a\r\n     gradual transformation as we go upward in the strata--i. e. onward\r\n     in time. Series I branches into three sub-series, in two of which\r\n     the change of form is extreme. Series IV is remarkable for great\r\n     increase in size as well as change in form. In the plate we give\r\n     only selected stages, but in the fuller plates of the memoir, and\r\n     still more in the shells themselves, the subtilest gradations are\r\n     found[19].\r\n\r\n    [19] Le Conte, _loc. cit._, pp. 236-7.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 89.--Transmutations of _Planorbis_. (After\r\n    Hyatt.)]\r\n\r\nHere is another and more recently observed case of transmutation in the\r\ncase of mollusks.\r\n\r\nThe recent species, _Strombus accipitrinus_, still inhabits the coasts\r\nof Florida. Its extinct prototype, _S. Leidy_, was discovered a few\r\nyears ago by Prof. Heilprin in the Pliocene formations of the interior\r\nof Florida. The peculiar shape of the wing, and tuberculation of the\r\nwhorl, are thus proved to have grown but of a previously more conical\r\nform of shell.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 90.--Transformation of _Strombus_.

(Fig. 1, p. 19.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe argument from geology is the argument from the distribution of\r\nspecies in time. I will next take the argument from the distribution of\r\nspecies in space--that is, the present geographical distribution of\r\nplants and animals.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the theory of descent with adaptive modification implies\r\nslow and gradual change of one species into another, and progressively\r\nstill more slow and gradual changes of one genus, family, or order into\r\nanother genus, family, or order, we should expect on this theory that\r\nthe organic types living on any given geographical area would be found\r\nto resemble or to differ from organic types living elsewhere, according\r\nas the area is connected with or disconnected from other geographical\r\nareas. For instance, the large continental islands of Australia and New\r\nZealand are widely disconnected from all other lands of the world, and\r\ndeep sea soundings show that they have probably been thus disconnected,\r\neither since the time of their origin, or, at the least, through immense\r\ngeological epochs. The theory of evolution, therefore, would expect to\r\nfind two general facts with regard to the inhabitants of these islands.\r\nFirst, that the inhabitants should form, as it were, little worlds of\r\ntheir own, more or less unlike the inhabitants of any other parts of the\r\nglobe. And next, that some of these inhabitants should present us with\r\nindependent information touching archaic forms of life. For it is\r\nmanifestly most improbable that the course of evolutionary history\r\nshould have run exactly parallel in the case of these isolated oceanic\r\ncontinents and in continents elsewhere. Australia and New Zealand,\r\ntherefore, ought to present a very large number, not only of peculiar\r\nspecies and genera, but even of families, and possibly of orders. Now\r\nthis is just what Australia and New Zealand do present. The case of the\r\ndog being doubtful, there is an absence of all mammalian life, except\r\nthat of one of the oldest and least highly developed orders, the\r\nMarsupials. There even occurs a unique order, still lower in the scale\r\nof organization--so low, in fact, that it deserves to be regarded as but\r\nnascent mammalian: I mean, of course, the Monotremata. As regards Birds,\r\nwe have the peculiar wingless forms alluded to in a previous chapter\r\n(viz. that on Morphology); and, without waiting to go into details, it\r\nis notorious that the faunas of Australia and New Zealand are not only\r\nhighly peculiar, but also suggestively archaic. Therefore, in both the\r\nrespects above mentioned, the anticipations of our theory are fully\r\nborne out. But as it would take too long to consider, even cursorily,\r\nthe faunas and floras of these immense islands, I here allude to them\r\nonly for the sake of illustration. In order to present the argument from\r\ngeographical distribution within reasonable limits, I think it is best\r\nto restrict our examination to smaller areas; for these will better\r\nadmit of brief and yet adequate consideration. But of course it will be\r\nunderstood that the less isolated the region, and the shorter the time\r\nthat it has been isolated, the smaller amount of peculiarity should we\r\nexpect to meet with on the part of its present inhabitants. Or,\r\nconversely stated, the longer and the greater the isolation, the more\r\npeculiarity of species would our theory expect to find. The object of\r\nthe present chapter will be to show that these, and other cognate\r\nexpectations, are fully realized by facts; but, before proceeding to do\r\nthis, I must say a few words on the antecedent standing of the argument.\r\n\r\nWhere the question is, as at present, between the rival theories of\r\nspecial creation and gradual transmutation, it may at first sight well\r\nappear that no test can be at once so crucial and so easily applied as\r\nthis of comparing the species of one geographical area with those of\r\nanother, in order to see whether there is any constant correlation\r\nbetween differences of type and degrees of separation. But a little\r\nfurther thought is enough to show that the test is not quite so simple\r\nor so absolute--that it is a test to be applied in a large and general\r\nway over the surface of the whole earth, rather than one to be relied\r\nupon as exclusively rigid in every special case.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is the obvious consideration that lands or\r\nseas which are discontinuous now may not always have been so, or not for\r\nlong enough to admit of the effects of separation having been exerted to\r\nany considerable extent upon their inhabitants. Next, there is the\r\nscarcely less important consideration, that although land areas may long\r\nhave been separated from one another by extensive tracts of ocean,\r\nbirds and insects may more or less easily have been able to fly from\r\none to the other; while even non-flying animals and plants may often\r\nhave been transported by floating ice or timber, wind or water currents,\r\nand sundry other means of dispersal. Again, there is the important\r\ninfluence of climate to be taken into account. We know from geological\r\nevidence that in the course of geological time the self-same continents\r\nhave been submitted to enormous changes of temperature--varying in fact\r\nfrom polar cold to almost tropical heat; and as it is manifestly\r\nimpossible that forms of life suited to one of these climates could have\r\nsurvived during the other, we can here perceive a further and most\r\npotent cause interfering with the test of geographical distribution as\r\nindiscriminately applied in all cases. When the elephant and\r\nhippopotamus were flourishing in England amid the luxuriant vegetation\r\nwhich these large animals require, it is evident that scarcely any one\r\nspecies of either the fauna or the flora of this country can have been\r\nthe same as it was when its African climate gave place to that of\r\nGreenland. Therefore, as Mr. Wallace observes, \"If glacial epochs in\r\ntemperate lands and mild climates near the poles have, as now believed\r\nby men of eminence, occurred several times over in the past history of\r\nthe earth, the effects of such great and repeated changes both on\r\nmigration, modification, and extinction of species, must have been of\r\noverwhelming importance--of more importance perhaps than even the\r\ngeological changes of sea and land.\"\r\n\r\nBut although for these, and certain other less important reasons which I\r\nneed not wait to detail, we must conclude that the evidence from\r\ngeographical distribution is not to be regarded as a crucial test\r\nbetween the rival theories of creation and evolution in all cases\r\nindiscriminately, I must next remark that it is undoubtedly one of the\r\nstrongest lines of evidence which we possess. When we once remember\r\nthat, according to the general theory of evolution itself, the present\r\ngeographical distribution of plants and animals is \"the visible outcome\r\nor residual product of the whole past history of the earth,\" and,\r\ntherefore, that of the conditions determining the characters of life\r\ninhabiting this and that particular area continuity or discontinuity\r\nwith other areas is but one,--when we remember this, we find that no\r\nfurther reservation has to be made: all the facts of geographical\r\ndistribution speak with one consent in favour of the naturalistic\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first of these facts which I shall adduce is, that although the\r\ngeographical range of any given species is, as a rule, continuous, such\r\nis far from being always the case. Very many species have more or less\r\ndiscontinuous ranges--the mountain-hare, for instance, extending from\r\nthe Arctic regions over the greater portion of Europe to the Ural\r\nMountains and the Caucasus, and yet over all this enormous tract\r\nappearing only in isolated or discontinuous patches, where there happen\r\nto be either mountain ranges or climates cold enough to suit its nature.\r\nNow, in all such cases of discontinuity in the range of a species the\r\ntheory of evolution has a simple explanation to offer--namely, either\r\nthat some representatives of the species have at some former period been\r\nable to migrate from one region to the other, or else that at one time\r\nthe species occupied the whole of the range in question, but afterwards\r\nbecame broken up as geographical, climatic, or other changes rendered\r\nparts of the area unfit for the species to inhabit. Thus, for instance,\r\nit is easy to understand that during the last cold epoch the\r\nmountain-hare would have had a continuous range; but that as the Arctic\r\nclimate gradually receded to polar regions, the species would be able to\r\nsurvive in southern latitudes only on mountain ranges, and thus would\r\nbecome broken up into many discontinuous patches, corresponding with\r\nthese ranges. In the same way we can explain the occurrence of Arctic\r\nvegetation on the Alps and Pyrenees--namely, as left behind by the\r\nretreat of the Arctic climate at the close of the glacial period.\r\n\r\nBut now, on the other hand, the theory of special creation cannot so\r\nwell afford to render this obvious explanation of discontinuity. In the\r\ncase of the Arctic flora of the Alps, for instance, although it is true\r\nthat much of this vegetation is of an Arctic type, it is not true that\r\nthe species are all identical with those which occur in the Arctic\r\nregions. Therefore the theory of special creation would here have to\r\nassume that, although the now common species were left behind on the\r\nAlps by the retreat of glaciation northwards, the peculiar Alpine\r\nspecies were afterwards created separately upon the Alps, and yet\r\ncreated with such close affinities to the pre-existing species as to be\r\nincluded with them under the same genera. Looking to the absurdity of\r\nthis supposition, as well as of others which I need not wait to mention,\r\ncertain advocates of special creation have sought to take refuge in\r\nanother hypothesis--namely, that species which present a markedly\r\ndiscontinuous range may have had a corresponding number of different\r\ncentres of creation, the same specific type having been turned down, so\r\nto speak, on widely separated areas. But to me it seems that this\r\nexplanation presents even greater difficulty than the other. If it is\r\ndifficult to say why the Divinity should have chosen to create new\r\nspecies of plants on the Alps on so precisely the same pattern as the\r\nold, much more would it be difficult to say why, in addition to these\r\nnew species, he should also have created again the old species which he\r\nhad already placed in the Arctic regions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for discontinuity of distribution. The next general fact\r\nto be adduced is, that there is no constant correlation between habitats\r\nand animals or plants suited to live upon them. Of course all the\r\nanimals and plants living upon any given area are well suited to live\r\nupon that area; for otherwise they could not be there. But the point now\r\nis, that besides the area on which they do live, there are usually many\r\nother areas in different parts of the globe where they might have lived\r\nequally well--as is proved by the fact that when transported by man they\r\nthrive as well, or even better, than in their native country. Therefore,\r\nupon the supposition that all species were separately created in the\r\ncountries where they are respectively found, we must conclude that they\r\nwere created in only some of the places where they might equally well\r\nhave lived. Probably there is at most but a small percentage either of\r\nplants or animals which would not thrive in some place, or places, on\r\nthe earth's surface other than that in which they occur; and hence we\r\nmust say that one of the objects of special creation--if this be the\r\ntrue theory--was that of depositing species in only some among the\r\nseveral parts of the earth's surface equally well suited to support\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not contend that this fact in itself raises any difficulty\r\nagainst the theory of special creation. But I do think that a very\r\nserious difficulty is raised when to this fact we add another--namely,\r\nthat on every biological region we encounter species related to other\r\nspecies in genera, and usually also genera related to other genera in\r\nfamilies. For if each of all the constituent species of a genus, and\r\neven of a family, were separately created, we must hence conclude that\r\nin depositing them there was an unaccountable design manifested to make\r\nareas of distribution correspond to the natural affinities of their\r\ninhabitants. For example, the humming-birds are geographically\r\nrestricted to America, and number 120 genera, comprising over 400\r\nspecies. Hence, if this betokens 400 separate acts of creation, it\r\ncannot possibly have been due to chance that they were all performed on\r\nthe same continent: it must have been design which led to every species\r\nof this large family of birds having been deposited in one geographical\r\narea. Or, to take a case where only the species of a single genus are\r\nconcerned. The rats and mice proper constitute a genus which comprises\r\naltogether more than 100 species, and they are all exclusively\r\nrestricted to the Old World. In the New World they are represented by\r\nanother genus comprising about 70 species, which resemble their Old\r\nWorld cousins in form and habits; but differ from them in dentition and\r\nother such minor points. Now, the question is,--Why should all the 100\r\nspecies have been separately created on one side of the Atlantic with\r\none pattern of dentition, and all the 70 species on the other side with\r\nanother pattern? What has the Atlantic Ocean got to do with any\r\n\"archetypal plan\" of rats' teeth?\r\n\r\nOr again, to recur to Australia, why should all the mammalian forms of\r\nlife be restricted to the one group of Marsupials, when we know that not\r\nonly the Rodents, such as the rabbit, but all other orders of mammals,\r\nwould thrive there equally well. And similarly, of course, in countless\r\nother instances. Everywhere we meet with this same correlation between\r\nareas of distribution and affinities of classification.\r\n\r\nNow, it is at once manifest how completely this general fact harmonizes\r\nwith the theory of evolution. If the 400 species of humming-birds, for\r\ninstance, are all modified descendants of common ancestors, and if none\r\nof their constituent individuals have ever been large enough to make\r\ntheir way across the oceans which practically isolate their territory\r\nfrom all other tropical and sub-tropical regions of the globe, then we\r\ncan understand why it is that all the 400 species occupy the same\r\ncontinent. But on the special-creation theory we can see no reason why\r\nthe 400 species should all have been deposited in America. And, as\r\nalready observed, we must remember that this correlation between a\r\ngeographically restricted habitat and the zoological or botanical\r\naffinities of its inhabitants, is repeated over and over and over again\r\nin the faunas and floras of the world, so that merely to enumerate the\r\ninstances would require a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the general argument thus presented in favour of descent\r\nwith continuous modification admits of being enormously strengthened by\r\nthree different classes of additional facts.\r\n\r\nThe first is, that the correlation in question--namely, that between a\r\ngeographically restricted habitat and the zoological or botanical\r\naffinities of its inhabitants--is not limited to the now existing\r\nspecies, but extends also to the extinct. That is to say, the dead\r\nspecies are allied to the living species, as we should expect that they\r\nmust be, if the latter are modified descendants of the former. On the\r\nalternative theory, however, we have to suppose that the policy of\r\nmaintaining a correlation between geographical restriction and natural\r\naffinity extends very much further back than even the existing species\r\nof plants and animals; indeed we must suppose that a practically\r\ninfinite number of additional acts of separate creation were governed by\r\nthe same policy, in the case of long lines of species long since\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nThus far, then, the only answer which an advocate of special creation\r\ncan adduce is, that for some reason unknown to us such a policy may have\r\nbeen more wise than it appears: it may have served some inscrutable\r\npurpose that allied products of distinct acts of creation should all be\r\nkept together on the same areas. Well, in answer to this unjustifiable\r\nappeal to the argument from ignorance, I will adduce the second of the\r\nthree considerations. This is, that in cases where the geographical\r\nareas are not restricted the policy in question fails. In other words,\r\nwhere the inhabitants of an area are free to migrate to other areas, the\r\npolicy of correlating affinity with distribution is most significantly\r\nforgotten. In this case species wander away from their native homes, and\r\nthe course of their wanderings is marked by the origination of new\r\nspecies springing up en route. Now, is it reasonable to suppose that the\r\nmere circumstance of some members of a species being able to leave their\r\nnative home should furnish any occasion for creating new and allied\r\nspecies upon the tracts over which they travel, or the territories to\r\nwhich they go? When the 400 existing species of humming-birds have all\r\nbeen created on the same continent for some reason supposed to be\r\nunknown, why should this reason give way before the accident of any\r\nmeans of migration being furnished to humming-birds, so that they should\r\nbe able to visit, say the continents of Africa and Asia, there gain a\r\nfooting beside the sun-birds, and henceforth determine a new centre for\r\nthe separate creation of additional species of humming-birds peculiar to\r\nthe Old World--as has happened in the case of the majority of species\r\nwhich, unlike the humming-birds, have been at any time free to migrate\r\nfrom their original homes?\r\n\r\nLastly, my third consideration is, that the supposed policy in question\r\ndoes not extend to affinities which are wider than those between species\r\nand genera--more rarely to families, scarcely ever to orders, and never\r\nto classes. In other words, nature shows a double correlation in her\r\ngeographical distribution of organic types:--first, that which we have\r\nalready considered between geographical restriction and natural\r\naffinity among inhabitants of the same areas; second, another of a more\r\ndetailed character between _degrees_ of geographical restriction and\r\n_degrees_ of natural affinity. The more distant the affinity, the more\r\ngeneral is the extension. This, of course, is what we should expect on\r\nthe theory of descent with modification, because the more distant the\r\naffinity, and therefore, _ex hypothesi_, the larger and the older the\r\noriginal group of organisms, the greater must be the chance of\r\ndispersal. The 400 species of humming-birds may well be unable to\r\nmigrate from their native continent; but it would indeed have been an\r\nunaccountable fact if no other species of all the class of birds had\r\never been able to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean. Thus, on the theory\r\nof evolution, we can well understand the second correlation now before\r\nus--namely, between remoteness of affinity and generality of\r\ndispersal,--so that there is no considerable portion of the habitable\r\nglobe without representatives of all the classes of animals, few\r\nportions without representatives of all the orders, but many portions\r\nwithout many of the families, innumerable portions without innumerable\r\ngenera, and, of course, all portions without the great majority of\r\nspecies. Now, while this general correlation thus obviously supports the\r\ntheory of natural descent with progressive modification, it makes\r\ndirectly against the opposite theory of special creation. For we have\r\nrecently seen that when we restrict our view to the case of species and\r\ngenera, the theory of special creation is obliged to suppose that for\r\nsome inscrutable reason the Deity had regard to systematic affinity\r\nwhile determining on what large areas to create his species[20]. But\r\nnow we see that he must be held to have neglected this inscrutable\r\nreason (whatever it was) when he passed beyond the range of genera--and\r\nthis always in proportion to the remoteness of systematic affinity on\r\nthe part of the species concerned.\r\n\r\n    [20] I say \"_large_ areas\" for the sake of argument; but the same\r\n    correlation between distribution and affinity extends likewise to\r\n    _small_ areas where only _small_ differences of affinity are\r\n    concerned. Thus, for instance, speaking of smaller areas, Moritz\r\n    Wagner says:--\"The broader and more rapid the river, the higher and\r\n    more regular the mountain-chain, the calmer and more extensive the\r\n    sea, the more considerable, as a general rule, will be the taxonomic\r\n    separation between the populations\"; and he shows that, in\r\n    correlation with such differences in the _degrees_ of separation,\r\n    are the _degrees_ of diversification--i. e., the _numbers_ of\r\n    species, and even of varieties, which these topographical barriers\r\n    determine.\r\n\r\nI cannot well conceive a _reductio ad absurdum_ more complete than this.\r\nBut, having now presented these most general facts of geographical\r\ndistribution in their relation to the issue before us, we may next\r\nproceed to consider a few illustrations of them in detail, for in this\r\nway I think that their overwhelming weight may become yet more\r\nabundantly apparent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will assist us in dealing with these detailed illustrations if we\r\nbegin by considering the means of dispersal of organisms from one place\r\nto another. Of course the most ordinary means is that of continuous\r\nwandering, or emigration; but where geographical barriers of any kind\r\nhave to be surmounted, organisms may only be able to pass them by more\r\nexceptional and accidental means. The principal barriers of a\r\ngeographical kind are oceans, rivers, mountain-chains, and\r\ndesert-tracts, in the case of terrestrial organisms; and, in the case\r\nof aquatic organisms, the presence of land. But it is to be observed\r\nthat, as regards marine organisms, any considerable difference in the\r\ntemperature of the water may constitute a barrier as effectual as the\r\npresence of land; and also that, in the case of all shallow-water\r\nfaunas, a tract of deep ocean constitutes almost as complete a barrier\r\nas it does to terrestrial faunas.\r\n\r\nNow, the means whereby barriers admit of being accidentally or\r\noccasionally surmounted are, of course, various; and they differ in the\r\ncase of different organisms. Birds, bats, and insects, on account of\r\ntheir powers of flight, are particularly apt to be blown out great\r\ndistances to sea, and hence of all animals are most likely to become the\r\ninvoluntary colonists of distant shores. Floating timber serves to\r\nconvey seeds and eggs of small animals over great distances; and Darwin\r\nhas shown that many kinds of seeds are able of themselves to float for\r\nmore than a month in sea-water without losing their powers of\r\ngermination. For instance, out of 87 kinds, 64 germinated after an\r\nimmersion of 28 days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. As a\r\nresult of all his experiments he concludes, that the seeds of at least\r\nten per cent. of the species of plants of any country might be floated\r\nby sea-currents during 28 days, without losing their powers of\r\ngermination; and this, at the average rate of flow of several Atlantic\r\ncurrents, would serve to transport the seeds to a distance of at least\r\n900 miles. Again, he proved that even seeds which are quickly destroyed\r\nby contact with sea-water admit of being successfully transported during\r\n30 days, if they be contained within the crop of a dead bird. He also\r\nproved that living birds are most active agents in the work of\r\ndissemination, and this not only by taking seeds into their crops\r\n(where, so long as they remain, the seeds are uninjured), but likewise\r\nby carrying seeds (and even young mollusks) attached to their feet and\r\nfeathers. In the course of these experiments he found that a small\r\ncup-full of mud, which he gathered from the edges of three ponds in\r\nFebruary, was so charged with seeds that when sown in the ground these\r\nfew ounces of mud yielded no less than 537 plants, belonging to many\r\ndifferent species. It is therefore evident what opportunities are thus\r\nafforded for the transportation of seeds on the feet and bills of\r\nwading-birds. Lastly, floating ice is well known to act as a carrier of\r\nany kind of life which may prove able to survive this mode of transit.\r\n\r\nSuch being the nature of geographical barriers, and the means that\r\norganisms of various kinds may occasionally have of overcoming them, I\r\nwill now give a few detailed illustrations of the argument from\r\ngeographical distribution, as previously presented in its general form.\r\n\r\nTo begin with aquatic animals. As Darwin remarks, \"the marine\r\ninhabitants of the Eastern and Western shores of South America are very\r\ndistinct; with extremely few shells, crustacea, or echinodermata in\r\ncommon.\" Again, westward of the shores of America, a wide space of open\r\nocean extends, which, as we have seen, furnishes as effectual a barrier\r\nas does the land to any emigration of shallow-water animals. Now, as\r\nsoon as this reach of deep water is passed, we meet in the eastern\r\nislands of the Pacific with another and totally distinct fauna. \"So that\r\nthree marine faunas range northward and southward in parallel lines not\r\nfar from each other, under corresponding climates\": they are, however,\r\n\"separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of land or\r\nopen sea\": and it is in exact coincidence with the course of these\r\nbarriers that we find so remarkable a differentiation of the faunas[21].\r\nObviously, therefore, it is impossible to suggest that this correlation\r\nis accidental. Altogether many thousands of species are involved, and\r\nwithin this comparatively limited area they are sharply marked off into\r\nthree groups as to their natural affinities, and into three groups as to\r\ntheir several basins. Hence, if all these species were separately\r\ncreated, there is no escape from the conclusion that for some reason or\r\nanother the act of creation was governed by the presence of these\r\nbarriers, so that species deposited on the Eastern shores of South\r\nAmerica were formed with one set of natural affinities, while species\r\ndeposited on the Western shore were formed with another set; and\r\nsimilarly with regard to the third set of species in the third basin,\r\nwhich, extending over a whole hemisphere to the coast of Africa without\r\nany further barrier, nowhere presents, over this vast area, any other\r\ncase of a distinct marine fauna. But what conceivable reason can there\r\nhave been thus to consult these geographical barriers in the original\r\ncreation of specific types? Even if such a case stood alone, it would\r\nbe strongly suggestive of error on the part of the special creation\r\ntheory. But let us take another case, this time from fresh-water faunas.\r\n\r\n    [21] The only exception is in the case of the fish on each side of\r\n    the isthmus of panama, where about 30 per cent, of the species are\r\n    identical. But it is possible enough that at some previous time this\r\n    narrow isthmus may have been even narrower than at present, if not\r\n    actually open. At all events, the fact that this partial exception\r\n    occurs just where the land-barrier is so narrow, is more suggestive\r\n    of migration than of independent creation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the geographical distribution of fresh-water fish and\r\nfresh-water shells is often surprisingly extensive and apparently\r\ncapricious, this may be explained by the means of dispersal being here\r\nso varied--not only aquatic birds, floods, and whirlwinds, but also\r\ngeographical changes of water-shed having all assisted in the process.\r\nMoreover, in some cases it is possible that the habits of more widely\r\ndistributed fresh-water fish may have originally been wholly or partly\r\nmarine--which, of course, would explain the existing discontinuity of\r\ntheir existing fresh-water distribution. But, be this as it may (and it\r\nis not a question that affects the issue between special creation and\r\ngradual evolution, since it is only a question as to how a given species\r\nhas been dispersed from its original home, whether or not in that home\r\nit was specially created), the point I desire to bring forward is, that\r\nwhere we find a barrier to the emigration of fresh-water forms which is\r\nmore formidable than a thousand miles of ocean--a barrier over which\r\nneither water-fowl nor whirlwinds are likely to pass, and which is above\r\nthe reach of any geological changes of water-shed,--where we find such a\r\nbarrier, we always find a marked difference in the fresh-water faunas on\r\neither side of it. The kind of barrier to which I allude is a high\r\nmountain-chain. It may be only a few miles wide; yet it exercises a\r\ngreater influence on the diversification of specific types, where\r\nfresh-water faunas are concerned, than almost any other. But why should\r\nthis be the case on any intelligible theory of special creation? Why, in\r\nthe depositing of species of newly created fresh-water fish, should the\r\npresence of an impassable mountain-chain have determined so uniformly a\r\ndifference of specific affinity on either side of it? The question, so\r\nfar as I can see, does not admit of an answer from any reasonable\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning now from aquatic organisms to terrestrial, the body of facts\r\nfrom which to draw is so large, that I think the space at my disposal\r\nmay be best utilized by confining attention to a single division of\r\nthem--that, namely, which is furnished by the zoological study of\r\noceanic islands.\r\n\r\nIn the comparatively limited--but in itself extensive--class of facts\r\nthus presented, we have a particularly fair and cogent test as between\r\nthe alternative theories of evolution and creation. For where we meet\r\nwith a volcanic island, hundreds of miles from any other land, and\r\nrising abruptly from an ocean of enormous depth, we may be quite sure\r\nthat such an island can never have formed part of a now submerged\r\ncontinent. In other words, we may be quite sure that it always has been\r\nwhat it now is--an oceanic peak, separated from all other land by\r\nhundreds of miles of sea, and therefore an area supplied by nature for\r\nthe purpose, as it were, of testing the rival theories of creation and\r\nevolution. For, let us ask, upon these tiny insular specks of land what\r\nkind of life should we expect to find? To this question the theories of\r\nspecial creation and of gradual evolution would agree in giving the\r\nsame answer up to a certain point. For both theories would agree in\r\nsupposing that these islands would, at all events in large part, derive\r\ntheir inhabitants from accidental or occasional arrivals of wind-blown\r\nor water-floated organisms from other countries--especially, of course,\r\nfrom the countries least remote. But, after agreeing upon this point,\r\nthe two theories must part company in their anticipations. The\r\nspecial-creation theory can have no reason to suppose that a small\r\nvolcanic island in the midst of a great ocean should be chosen as the\r\ntheatre of any extraordinary creative activity, or for any particularly\r\nrich manufacture of peculiar species to be found nowhere else in the\r\nworld. On the other hand, the evolution theory would expect to find that\r\nsuch habitats are stocked with more or less peculiar species. For it\r\nwould expect that when any organisms chanced to reach a wholly isolated\r\nrefuge of this kind, their descendants should forthwith have started\r\nupon an independent course of evolutionary history. Protected from\r\nintercrossing with any members of their parent species elsewhere, and\r\nexposed to considerable changes in their conditions of life, it would\r\nindeed be fatal to the general theory of evolution if these descendants,\r\nduring the course of many generations, were not to undergo appreciable\r\nchange. It has happened on two or three occasions that European rats\r\nhave been accidentally imported by ships upon some of these islands, and\r\neven already it is observed that their descendants have undergone a\r\nslight change of appearance, so as to constitute them what naturalists\r\ncall local varieties. The change, of course, is but slight, because the\r\ntime allowed for it has been so short. But the longer the time that a\r\ncolony of a species is thus completely isolated under changed conditions\r\nof life the greater, according to the evolution theory, should we expect\r\nthe change to become. Therefore, in all cases where we happen to know,\r\nfrom independent evidence of a geological kind, that an oceanic island\r\nis of very ancient formation, the evolution theory would expect to\r\nencounter a great wealth of peculiar species. On the other hand, as I\r\nhave just observed, the special-creation theory can have no reason to\r\nsuppose that there should be any correlation between the age of an\r\noceanic island and the number of peculiar species which it may be found\r\nto contain.\r\n\r\nTherefore, having considered the principles of geographical distribution\r\nfrom the widest or most general point of view, we shall pass to the\r\nopposite extreme, and consider exhaustively, or in the utmost possible\r\ndetail, the facts of such distribution where the conditions are best\r\nsuited to this purpose--that is, as I have already said, upon oceanic\r\nislands, which may be metaphorically regarded as having been formed by\r\nnature for the particular purpose of supplying naturalists with a\r\ncrucial test between the theories of creation and evolution. The\r\nmaterial upon which my analysis is to be based will be derived from the\r\nmost recent works upon geographical distribution--especially from the\r\nmagnificent contributions to this department of science which we owe to\r\nthe labours of Mr. Wallace. Indeed, all that follows may be regarded as\r\na condensed filtrate of the facts which he has collected. Even as thus\r\nrestricted, however, our subject-matter would be too extensive to be\r\ndealt with on the present occasion, were we to attempt an exhaustive\r\nanalysis of the floras and faunas of all oceanic islands upon the face\r\nof the globe. Therefore, what I propose to do is to select for such\r\nexhaustive analysis a few of what may be termed the most oceanic of\r\noceanic islands--that is to say, those oceanic islands which are most\r\nwidely separated from mainlands, and which, therefore, furnish the most\r\nunquestionable of test cases as between the theories of special creation\r\nand genetic descent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Azores._--A group of volcanic islands, nine in number, about 900 miles\r\nfrom the coast of Portugal, and surrounded by ocean depths of 1,800 to\r\n2,500 fathoms. There is geological evidence that the origin of the group\r\ndates back at least as far as Miocene times. There is a total absence of\r\nall terrestrial Vertebrata, other than those which are known to have\r\nbeen introduced by man. Flying animals, on the other hand, are abundant;\r\nnamely, 53 species of birds, one species of bat, a few species of\r\nbutterflies, moths, and hymenoptera, with 74 species of indigenous\r\nbeetles. All these animals are unmodified European species, with the\r\nexception of one bird and many of the beetles. Of the 74 indigenous\r\nspecies of the latter, 36 are not found in Europe; but 19 are natives of\r\nMadeira or the Canaries, and 3 are American, doubtless transplanted by\r\ndrift-wood. The remaining 14 species occur nowhere else in the world,\r\nthough for the most part they are allied to other European species.\r\nThere are 69 known species of land-shells, of which 37 are European, and\r\n32 peculiar, though all allied to European forms. Lastly, there are 480\r\nknown species of plants, of which 40 are peculiar, though allied to\r\nEuropean species.\r\n\r\n_Bermudas._--A small volcanic group of islands, 700 miles from North\r\nCarolina. Although there are about 100 islands in the group, their total\r\narea does not exceed 50 square miles. The group is surrounded by water\r\nvarying in depth from 2,500 to 3,800 fathoms. The only terrestrial\r\nVertebrate (unless the rats and mice are indigenous) is a lizard allied\r\nto an American form, but specifically distinct from it, and therefore a\r\nsolitary species which does not occur anywhere else in the world. None\r\nof the birds or bats are peculiar, any more than in the case of the\r\nAzores; but, as in that case, a large percentage of the land-shells are\r\nso--namely, at least one quarter of the whole. Neither the botany nor\r\nthe entomology of this group has been worked out; but I have said enough\r\nto show how remarkably parallel are the cases of these two volcanic\r\ngroups of islands situated in different hemispheres, but at about the\r\nsame distance from large continents. In both there is an extraordinary\r\npaucity of terrestrial vertebrata, and of any peculiar species of bird\r\nor beast. On the other hand, there is in both a marvellous wealth of\r\npeculiar species of insects and land-shells. Now these correlations are\r\nall abundantly intelligible. It is a difficult matter for any\r\nterrestrial animal to cross 900, or even 700, miles of ocean: therefore\r\nonly one lizard has succeeded in doing so in one of the two parallel\r\ncases; and, living cut off from intercrossing with its parent form, the\r\ndescendants of that lizard have become modified so as to constitute a\r\npeculiar species. But it is more easy for large flying animals to cross\r\nthose distances of ocean: consequently, there is only one instance of a\r\npeculiar species of bird or bat--namely, a bull-finch in the Azores,\r\nwhich, being a small land-bird, is not likely ever to have had any other\r\nvisitors from its original parent species coming over from Europe to\r\nkeep up the original breed. Lastly, it is very much more easy for\r\ninsects and land-mollusca to be conveyed to such islands by wind and\r\nfloating timber than it is for terrestrial mammals, or even than it is\r\nfor small birds and bats; but yet such means of transit are not\r\nsufficiently sure to admit of much recruiting from the mainland for the\r\npurpose of keeping up the specific types. Consequently, the insects and\r\nthe land-shells present a much greater proportion of peculiar\r\nspecies--namely, one half and one fourth of the land-shells in the one\r\ncase, and one eighth of the beetles in the other. All these\r\ncorrelations, I say, are abundantly intelligible on the theory of\r\nevolution; but who shall explain, on the opposite theory, why orders of\r\nbeetles and land-mollusca should have been chosen from among all other\r\nanimals for such superabundant creation on oceanic islands, so that in\r\nthe Azores alone we find no less than 32 of the one and 14 of the other?\r\nAnd, in this connexion, I may again allude to the peculiar species of\r\nbeetles in the island of Madeira. Here there are an enormous number of\r\npeculiar species, though they are nearly all related to, or included\r\nunder the same genera as, beetles on the neighbouring continent. Now, as\r\nwe have previously seen, no less than 200 of these species have lost the\r\nuse of their wings. Evolutionists explain this remarkable fact by their\r\ngeneral laws of degeneration under disuse, and the operation of natural\r\nselection, as will be shown later on; but it is not so easy for special\r\ncreationists to explain why this enormous number of peculiar species of\r\nbeetles should have been deposited on Madeira, all allied to beetles on\r\nthe nearest continent, and nearly all deprived of the use of their\r\nwings. And similarly, of course, with all the peculiar species of the\r\nBermudas and the Azores. For who will explain, on the theory of\r\nindependent creation, why all the peculiar species, both of animals and\r\nplants, which occur on the Bermudas should so unmistakably present\r\nAmerican affinities, while those which occur on the Azores no less\r\nunmistakably present European affinities? But to proceed to other, and\r\nstill more remarkable, cases.\r\n\r\n_The Galapagos Islands._--This archipelago is of volcanic origin,\r\nsituated under the equator between 500 and 600 miles from the West Coast\r\nof South America. The depth of the ocean around them varies from 2,000\r\nto 3,000 fathoms or more. This group is of particular interest, from the\r\nfact that it was the study of its fauna which first suggested to\r\nDarwin's mind the theory of evolution. I will, therefore, begin by\r\nquoting a short passage from his writings upon the zoological relations\r\nof this particular fauna.\r\n\r\n     Here almost every product of the land and of the water bears the\r\n     unmistakeable stamp of the American continent. There are twenty-six\r\n     land birds; of these, twenty-one, or perhaps twenty-three, are\r\n     ranked as distinct species, and would commonly be assumed to have\r\n     been here created; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to\r\n     American species is manifest in every character, in their habits,\r\n     gestures, and tones of voice. So it is with the other animals, and\r\n     with a large proportion of the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in\r\n     his admirable Flora of this archipelago. The naturalist, looking at\r\n     the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific, distant\r\n     several hundred miles from the continent, feels that he is standing\r\n     on American land. Why should this be so? Why should the species\r\n     which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos\r\n     Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plainly the stamp of\r\n     affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the\r\n     conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in\r\n     their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several\r\n     classes are associated together, which closely resembles the\r\n     conditions of the South American coast; in fact, there is a\r\n     considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other\r\n     hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic\r\n     nature of the soil, in the climate, height, and size of the\r\n     islands, between the Galapagos and Cape de Verde Archipelagoes; but\r\n     what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The\r\n     inhabitants of the Cape de Verde Islands are related to those of\r\n     Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. Facts such as these\r\n     admit of no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent\r\n     creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is obvious that\r\n     the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists from\r\n     America, and the Cape de Verde Islands from Africa; such colonists\r\n     would be liable to modification--the principle of inheritance still\r\n     betraying their original birthplace[22].\r\n\r\n    [22] _origin of species_, pp. 353-4.\r\n\r\nThe following is a synopsis of the fauna and flora of this archipelago,\r\nso far as at present known. The only terrestrial vertebrates are two\r\npeculiar species of land-tortoise, and one extinct species; five species\r\nof lizards, all peculiar--two of them so much so as to constitute a\r\npeculiar genus;--and two species of snakes, both closely allied to South\r\nAmerican forms. Of birds there are 57 species, of which no less than 38\r\nare peculiar; and all the non-peculiar species, except one, belong to\r\naquatic tribes. The true land birds are represented by 31 species, of\r\nwhich all, except one, are peculiar; while more than half of them go to\r\nconstitute peculiar genera. Moreover, while they are all unquestionably\r\nallied to South American forms, they present a beautiful series of\r\ngradations, \"from perfect identity with the continental species, to\r\ngenera so distinct that it is difficult to determine with what forms\r\nthey are most nearly allied; and it is interesting to note that this\r\ndiversity bears a distinct relation to the probabilities of, and\r\nfacilities for, migration to the islands. The excessively abundant\r\nrice-bird, which breeds in Canada, and swarms over the whole United\r\nStates, migrating to the West Indies and South America, visiting the\r\ndistant Bermudas almost every year, and extending its range as far as\r\nParaquay, is the only species of land-bird which remains completely\r\nunchanged in the Galapagos; and we may therefore conclude that some\r\nstragglers of the migrating host reach the islands sufficiently often to\r\nkeep up the purity of the breed[23].\" Again, of the thirty peculiar\r\nland-birds, it is observable that the more they differ from any other\r\nspecies or genera on the South American continent, the more certainly\r\nare they found to have their nearest relations among those South\r\nAmerican forms which have the more restricted range, and are therefore\r\nthe least likely to have found their way to the islands with any\r\nfrequency.\r\n\r\n    [23] Wallace, _Island Life_, pp. 271-2.\r\n\r\nThe insect fauna of the Galapagos islands is scanty, and chiefly\r\ncomposed of beetles. These number 35 species, which are nearly all\r\npeculiar, and in some cases go to constitute peculiar genera. The same\r\nremarks apply to the twenty species of land-shells. Lastly, of the total\r\nnumber of flowering plants (332 species) more than one half (174\r\nspecies) are peculiar. It is observable in the case of these peculiar\r\nspecies of plants--as also of the peculiar species of birds--that many\r\nof them are restricted to single islands. It is also observable that,\r\nwith regard both to the fauna and flora, the Galapagos Islands as a\r\nwhole are very much richer in peculiar species than either the Azores or\r\nBermudas, notwithstanding that both the latter are considerably more\r\nremote from their nearest continents. This difference, which at first\r\nsight appears to make against the evolutionary interpretation, really\r\ntends to confirm it. For the Galapagos Islands are situated in a calm\r\nregion of the globe, unvisited by those periodic storms and hurricanes\r\nwhich sweep over the North Atlantic, and which every year convey some\r\nstraggling birds, insects, seeds, &c., to the Azores and Bermudas.\r\nNotwithstanding their somewhat greater isolation geographically,\r\ntherefore, the Azores and Bermudas are really less isolated biologically\r\nthan are the Galapagos Islands; and hence the less degree of peculiarity\r\non the part of their endemic species. But, on the theory of special\r\ncreation, it is impossible to understand why there should be any such\r\ncorrelation between the prevalence of gales and a comparative inertness\r\nof creative activity. And, as we have seen, it is equally impossible on\r\nthis theory to understand why there should be a further correlation\r\nbetween the _degree_ of peculiarity on the part of the isolated\r\nspecies, and the degree in which their nearest allies on the mainland\r\nare there confined to narrow ranges, and therefore less likely to keep\r\nup any biological communication with the islands.\r\n\r\n_St. Helena._--A small volcanic island, ten miles long by eight wide,\r\nsituated in mid-ocean, 1100 miles from Africa, and 1800 from South\r\nAmerica. It is very mountainous and rugged, bounded for the most part by\r\nprecipices, rising from ocean depths of 17,000 feet, to a height above\r\nthe sea-level of nearly 3,000. When first discovered it was richly\r\nclothed with forests; but these were all destroyed by human agency\r\nduring the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The records of civilization\r\npresent no more lamentable instance of this kind of destruction. From a\r\nmerely pecuniary point of view the abolition of these primeval forests\r\nhas proved an irreparable loss; but from a scientific point of view the\r\nloss is incalculable. These forests served to harbour countless forms of\r\nlife, which extended at least from the Miocene age, and which, having\r\nfound there an ocean refuge, survived as the last remnants of a remote\r\ngeological epoch. In those days, as Mr. Wallace observes, St. Helena\r\nmust have formed a kind of natural museum or vivarium of archaic species\r\nof all classes, the interest of which we can now only surmise from the\r\nfew remnants of those remnants, which are still left among the more\r\ninaccessible portions of the mountain peaks and crater edges. These\r\nremnants of remnants are as follows.\r\n\r\nThere is a total absence of all indigenous mammals, reptiles,\r\nfresh-water fish, and true land-birds. There is, however, a species of\r\nplover, allied to one in South Africa; but it is specifically distinct,\r\nand therefore peculiar to the island. The insect life, on the other\r\nhand, is abundant. Of beetles no less than 129 species are believed to\r\nbe aboriginal, and, with one single exception, the whole number are\r\npeculiar to the island. \"But in addition to this large amount of\r\nspecific peculiarity (perhaps unequalled anywhere else in the world),\r\nthe beetles of this island are remarkable for their generic isolation,\r\nand for the altogether exceptional proportion in which the great\r\ndivisions of the order are represented. The species belong to 39 genera,\r\nof which no less than 25 are peculiar to the island; and many of these\r\nare such isolated forms that it is impossible to find their allies in\r\nany particular country[24].\" More than two-thirds of all the species\r\nbelong to the group of weevils--a circumstance which serves to explain\r\nthe great wealth of beetle-population, the weevils being beetles which\r\nlive in wood, and St. Helena having been originally a densely wooded\r\nisland. This circumstance is also in accordance with the view that the\r\npeculiar insect fauna has been in large part evolved from ancestors\r\nwhich reached the island by means of floating timber; for, of course, no\r\nexplanation can be suggested why special creation of this highly\r\npeculiar insect fauna should have run so disproportionately into the\r\nproduction of weevils. About two-thirds of the whole number of beetles,\r\nor over 80 species, show no close affinity with any existing insects,\r\nwhile the remaining third have some relations, though often very remote,\r\nwith European and African forms. That this high degree of peculiarity\r\nis due to high antiquity is further indicated, according to our theory,\r\nby the large number of species which some of the types comprise. Thus,\r\nthe 54 species of _Cossonidae_ may be referred to three types; the 11\r\nspecies of _Bembidium_ form a group by themselves; and the _Heteromera_\r\nform two groups. \"Now, each of these types may well be descended from a\r\nsingle species, which originally reached the island from some other\r\nland; and the great variety of generic and specific forms into which\r\nsome of them have diverged is an indication, and to some extent a\r\nmeasure, of the remoteness of their origin[25].\" But, on the\r\ncounter-supposition that all these 128 peculiar species were separately\r\ncreated to occupy this particular island, it is surely unaccountable\r\nthat they should thus present such an arborescence of natural affinities\r\namongst themselves.\r\n\r\n    [24] Wallace, _Island Life_, p. 287.\r\n\r\n    [25] Wallace, _Island Life_, p. 287.\r\n\r\nPassing over the rest of the insect fauna, which has not yet been\r\nsufficiently worked out, we next find that there are only 20 species of\r\nindigenous land-shells--which is not surprising when we remember by what\r\nenormous reaches of ocean the island is surrounded. Of these 20 species\r\nno less than 13 have become extinct, three are allied to European\r\nspecies, while the rest are so highly peculiar as to have no near allies\r\nin any other part of the globe. So that the land-shells tell exactly the\r\nsame story as the insects.\r\n\r\nLastly, the plants likewise tell the same story. The truly indigenous\r\nflowering plants are about 50 in number, besides 26 ferns. Forty of the\r\nformer and ten of the latter are peculiar to the island, and, as Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker tells us, \"cannot be regarded as very close specific\r\nallies of any other plants at all\" Seventeen of them belong to peculiar\r\ngenera, and the others all differ so markedly as species from their\r\ncongeners, that not one comes under the category of being an insular\r\nform of a continental species. So that with respect to its plants no\r\nless than with respect to its animals, we find that the island of St.\r\nHelena constitutes a little world of unique species, allied among\r\nthemselves, but diverging so much from all other known forms that in\r\nmany cases they constitute unique genera.\r\n\r\n_Sandwich Islands._--These are an extensive group of islands, larger\r\nthan any we have hitherto considered--the largest of the group being\r\nabout the size of Devonshire. The entire archipelago is volcanic, with\r\nmountains rising to a height of nearly 14,000 feet. The group is\r\nsituated in the middle of the North Pacific, at a distance of\r\nconsiderably over 2,000 miles from any other land, and surrounded by\r\nenormous ocean depths. The only terrestrial vertebrata are two lizards,\r\none of which constitutes a peculiar genus. There are 24 aquatic birds,\r\nfive of which are peculiar; four birds of prey, two of which are\r\npeculiar; and 16 land-birds, all of which are peculiar. Moreover, these\r\n16 land-birds constitute no less than 10 peculiar genera, and even one\r\npeculiar family of five genera. This is an amount of peculiarity far\r\nexceeding that of any other islands, and, of course, corresponds with\r\nthe great isolation of this archipelago. The only other animals which\r\nhave here been carefully studied are the land-shells, and these tell the\r\nsame story as the birds. For there are no less than 400 species which\r\nare all, without any exception, peculiar; while about three-quarters of\r\nthem go to constitute peculiar genera. Again, of the plants, 620 species\r\nare believed to be endemic; and of these 377 are peculiar, yielding no\r\nless than 39 peculiar genera.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrejudice apart, I think we must all now agree that it is needless to\r\ncontinue further this line of proof. I have chosen the smallest and most\r\nisolated islands for the purposes of our present argument, first because\r\nthese furnish the most crucial kind of test, and next because they best\r\nadmit of being dealt with in a short space. But, if necessary, a vast\r\namount of additional material could be furnished, not only from other\r\nsmall oceanic islands, but still more from the largest islands of the\r\nworld, such as Australia and New Zealand. However, after the detailed\r\ninventories which have now been given in the case of some of the smaller\r\nislands most remote from mainlands, we may well be prepared to accept it\r\nas a general law, that _wherever_ there is evidence of land-areas having\r\nbeen for a long time separated from other land-areas, there we meet with\r\na more or less extraordinary profusion of unique species, often running\r\nup into unique genera. And, in point of fact, so far as naturalists have\r\nhitherto been able to ascertain, _there is no exception to this general\r\nlaw in any region of the globe_. Moreover, there is everywhere a\r\nconstant correlation between the _degree_ of this peculiarity on the\r\npart of the fauna and flora, and the _time_ during which they have been\r\nisolated. Thus, for instance, among the islands which I have called\r\ninto evidence, those that are at once the most isolated and give\r\nindependent proofs of the highest antiquity, are the Galapagos Islands,\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, and St. Helena. Now, if we apply the method of\r\ntabular analysis to these three cases, we obtain the following most\r\nastonishing results. For the sake of simplicity I will omit the\r\nenumeration of peculiar genera, and confine attention to peculiar\r\nspecies. Moreover, I will consider only terrestrial animals; for, as we\r\nhave already seen, aquatic animals are so much more likely to reach\r\noceanic islands that they do not furnish nearly so fair a test of the\r\nevolutionary hypothesis.\r\n\r\n  PECULIAR SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  +------------+---------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |            | Shells. | Insects. | Reptiles. |  Birds.  | Mammals. |\r\n  |            +---------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n  | Sandwich.  |   400   |     ?    |     2     |    16    |    0     |\r\n  | Galapagos  |    15   |    35    |    10     |    30    |    0     |\r\n  | St. Helena |    20   |   128    |     0     |     1    |    0     |\r\n  +------------+---------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |  Totals.   |   435   |   163    |    12     |    47    |    0     |\r\n  +------------+---------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n  NON-PECULIAR SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  +------------+---------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |            | Shells. | Insects. | Reptiles. |  Birds. | Mammals.  |\r\n  |            +---------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n  | Sandwich.  |     0   |     ?    |     0     |     0    |    0     |\r\n  | Galapagos  |     ?   |     ?    |     0     |     1    |    0     |\r\n  | St. Helena |     0   |     ?    |     0     |     0    |    0     |\r\n  +------------+---------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |  Totals.   |     0   |     ?    |     0     |     1    |    0     |\r\n  +------------+---------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nFrom this synopsis we perceive that out of a total of 658 species of\r\nterrestrial animals known to inhabit these three oceanic territories,\r\nall are peculiar, with the exception of a single land-bird which is\r\nfound in the Galapagos Islands. This is the rice-bird, so very abundant\r\non the American continent that its representatives must not unfrequently\r\nbecome the involuntary colonists of the Archipelago. There are, however,\r\na few species of non-peculiar insects inhabiting the Sandwich and\r\nGalapagos Islands, the exact number of which is doubtful, and on this\r\naccount are not here quoted. But at most they would be represented by\r\nunits, and therefore do not affect the general result. Lastly, the\r\nremarkable fact will be noted, that there is no single representative of\r\nthe mammalian class in any of these islands.\r\n\r\nIf we turn next to consider the case of plants, we obtain the following\r\nresult:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------+-----------+--------------+\r\n  |           |_Peculiar  |_Non-peculiar |\r\n  |           | Species._ | Species._    |\r\n  +-----------|-----------|--------------+\r\n  |Sandwich   |    377    |     243      |\r\n  |Galapagos  |    174    |     158      |\r\n  |St. Helena |     50    |      26      |\r\n  |           |   ----    |    ----      |\r\n  |  Totals   |    601    |     427      |\r\n  +-----------+-----------+--------------+\r\n\r\nSo that by adding together peculiar species both of land-animals and\r\nplants, we find that on these three limited areas alone there are 1258\r\nforms of life which occur nowhere else upon the globe--not to speak of\r\nthe peculiar aquatic species, nor of the presumably large number of\r\npeculiar species of all kinds not hitherto discovered in these\r\nimperfectly explored regions.\r\n\r\nNow let us compare these facts with those which are presented by the\r\nfaunas and floras of islands less remote from continents, and known\r\nfrom independent geological evidence to be of comparatively recent\r\norigin--that is, to have been separated from their adjacent mainlands in\r\ncomparatively recent times, and therefore as islands to be comparatively\r\nyoung. The British Isles furnish as good an instance as could be chosen,\r\nfor they together comprise over 1000 islands of various sizes, which are\r\nnowhere separated from one another by deep seas, and in the opinion of\r\ngeologists were all continuous with the European continent since the\r\nglacial period.\r\n\r\n  BRITISH ISLES.\r\n\r\n  NON-PECULIAR SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  +---------+---------+----------+-----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |         |  Land   |          | Reptiles  |  Land   |  Land   |\r\n  | Plants. | Shells. | Insects. |   and     |  Birds. | Mammals.|\r\n  |         |         |          | Amphibia. |         |         |\r\n  +---------+---------+----------+-----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |   1462  |    83   |  12,551  |    13     |   130   |    40   |\r\n  +---------+---------+----------+-----------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\n  PECULIAR SPECIES.\r\n  +---------+---------+----------+-----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |         |  Land   |          | Reptiles  |  Land   |  Land   |\r\n  | Plants. | Shells. | Insects. |   and     |  Birds. | Mammals.|\r\n  |         |         |          | Amphibia. |         |         |\r\n  +---------+---------+----------+-----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |    46   |    4    |   149    |     0     |    1    |    0    |\r\n  +---------+---------+----------+-----------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\n       Total Peculiar Plants               46\r\n       Total Peculiar Animals             154\r\n                                         ----\r\n       Grand Total                        200\r\n\r\nI have drawn up this table in the most liberal manner possible,\r\nincluding as peculiar species forms which many naturalists regard as\r\nmerely local varieties. But, even as thus interpreted, how wonderful is\r\nthe contrast between the 1000 islands of Great Britain and the single\r\nvolcanic rock of St. Helena, where almost all the animals and about half\r\nthe plants are peculiar, instead of about 1/80 of the animals, and 1/30\r\nof the plants. Of course, if no peculiar species of any kind had\r\noccurred in the British Isles, advocates of special creation might have\r\nargued that it was, so to speak, needless for the Divinity to have added\r\nany new species to those European forms which fully populated the\r\nislands at the time when they were separated from the continent. But, as\r\nthe matter stands, advocates of special creation must face the fact that\r\na certain small number of new and peculiar species have been formed on\r\nthe British Isles; and, therefore, that creative activity has not been\r\nwholly suspended in their case. Why, then, has it been so meagre in this\r\ncase of a thousand islands, when it has proved so profuse in the case of\r\nall single islands more remote from mainlands, and presenting a higher\r\nantiquity? Or why should the Divinity have thus appeared so uniformly to\r\nconsult these merely accidental circumstances of space and time in the\r\ndepositing of his unique specific types? Do not such facts rather speak\r\nwith irresistible force in favour of the view, that while all ancient\r\nand solitary islands have had time enough, and separation enough, to\r\nadmit of distinct histories of evolution having been written in their\r\nliving inhabitants, no one of the thousand islands of Great Britain has\r\nhad either time enough, or separation enough, to have admitted of more\r\nthan some of the first pages of such a history having been commenced?\r\n\r\nBut this allusion to Great Britain introduces us to another point. It\r\nwill have been observed that, unlike oceanic islands remote from\r\nmainlands, Great Britain is well furnished both with reptiles (including\r\namphibia) and mammals. For there is no instance of any oceanic island\r\nsituated at more than 300 miles from a continent where any single\r\nspecies of the whole class of mammals is to be found, excepting species\r\nof the only order which is able to fly--namely, the bats. And the same\r\nhas to be said of frogs, toads, and newts, whose spawn is quickly killed\r\nby contact with sea-water, and therefore could never have reached remote\r\nislands in a living state. Hence, on evolutionary principles; it is\r\nquite intelligible why oceanic islands should not present any species of\r\nmammals or batrachians--peculiar or otherwise,--save such species of\r\nmammals as are able to fly. But on the theory of special creation we can\r\nassign no reason why, notwithstanding the extraordinary profusion of\r\nunique types of other kinds which we have seen to occur on oceanic\r\nislands, the Deity should have made this curious exception to the\r\ndetriment of all frogs, toads, newts, and mammals, save only such as are\r\nable to fly. Or, if any one should go so far to save a desperate\r\nhypothesis as to maintain that there must have been some hidden reason\r\nwhy batrachians and quadrupeds were not specially created on oceanic\r\nislands, I may mention another small--but in this relation a most\r\nsignificant--fact. This is that on some of these islands there occur\r\ncertain peculiar species of plants, the seeds of which are provided with\r\nnumerous tiny hooks, obviously and beautifully adapted--like those on\r\nthe seeds of allied plants elsewhere--to catch the wool or hair of\r\nmoving quadrupeds, and so to further their own dissemination. But, as we\r\nhave just seen, there are no quadrupeds in the islands to meet these\r\nbeautiful adaptations on the part of the plants; so that special\r\ncreationists must resort to the almost impious supposition that in these\r\ncases the Deity has only carried out half his plan, in that while he\r\nmade an elaborate provision for these uniquely created species of\r\nplants, which depended for its efficiency on the presence of quadrupeds,\r\nhe nevertheless neglected to place any quadrupeds on the islands where\r\nhe had placed the plants. Such one-sided attempts at adaptation surely\r\nresolve the thesis of special creation to a _reductio ad absurdum_; and\r\nhence the only reasonable interpretation of them is, that while the\r\nseeds of allied or ancestral plants were able to float to the islands,\r\nno quadrupeds were ever able over so great a distance to swim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough much more evidence might still be given under the head of\r\ngeographical distribution, I must now close with a brief summary of the\r\nmain points that have been adduced.\r\n\r\nAfter certain preliminary considerations, I began by noticing that the\r\ntheory of evolution has a much more intelligible account to give than\r\nhas its rival of the facts of discontinuous distribution--the Alpine\r\nflora, for instance, being allied to the Arctic, not because the same\r\nspecies were separately created in both places, but because during the\r\nglacial period these species extended all over Europe, and were left\r\nbehind on the Alps as the Arctic flora receded northwards--which was\r\nsufficiently long ago to explain why some of the Alpine species are\r\nunique, though closely allied to Arctic forms.\r\n\r\nNext we saw that, although living things are always adapted to the\r\nclimates under which they live (since otherwise they could not live\r\nthere at all), it is equally true that, as a rule, besides the area on\r\nwhich they do live, there are many other areas in different parts of the\r\nglobe where they might have lived equally well. Consequently we must\r\nconclude that, if all species were separately created, many species were\r\nseverally created on only one among a number of areas where they might\r\nequally well have thrived. Now, although this conclusion in itself may\r\nnot seem opposed to the theory of special creation, a most serious\r\ndifficulty is raised when it is taken in connexion with another fact of\r\nan equally general kind. This is, that on every biological region we\r\nencounter chains of allied species constituting allied genera, families,\r\nand so on; while we scarcely ever meet with allied species in different\r\nbiological regions, notwithstanding that their climates may be similar,\r\nand, consequently, just as well suited to maintain some of the allied\r\nspecies. Hence we must further conclude, if all species were separately\r\ncreated, that in the work of creation some unaccountable regard was paid\r\nto making areas of distribution correspond to degrees of structural\r\naffinity. A great many species of the rat genus were created in the Old\r\nWorld, and a great many species of another, though allied, genus were\r\ncreated in the New World: yet no reason can be assigned why no one\r\nspecies of the Old World series should not just as well have been\r\ndeposited in the New World, and _vice versa_. On the other hand, the\r\ntheory of evolution may claim as direct evidence in its support all the\r\ninnumerable cases such as these--cases, indeed, so innumerable that, as\r\nMr. Wallace remarks, it may be taken as a law of nature that \"every\r\nspecies has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a\r\npre-existing and closely allied species.\" A general law which, while in\r\nitself most strongly suggestive of evolution, is surely impossible to\r\nreconcile with any reasonable theory of special creation. Furthermore,\r\nthis law extends backwards through all geological time, with the result\r\nthat the extinct species which now occur only as fossils on any given\r\ngeological area, resemble the species still living upon that area, as we\r\nshould expect that they must, if the former were the natural progenitors\r\nof the latter. On the other hand, if they were not the natural\r\nprogenitors, but all the species, both living and extinct, were the\r\nsupernatural and therefore independent creations which the rival theory\r\nwould suppose, then no reason can be given why the extinct species\r\nshould thus resemble the living--any more than why the living species\r\nshould resemble one another. For, as we have seen, there are almost\r\nalways many other habitats on other parts of the globe, where any\r\nmembers of any given group of species might equally well have been\r\ndeposited; and this, of course, applies to geological no less than to\r\nhistorical time. Yet throughout all time we meet with this most\r\nsuggestive correlation between continuity of a geographical area and\r\nstructural affinity between the forms of life which have lived, or are\r\nstill living, upon that area.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we find the further, and no less suggestive, correlation\r\nbetween the birth of new species and the immediate pre-existence of\r\nclosely allied species on the same area--or, at most, on closely\r\ncontiguous areas.\r\n\r\nWhere a continuous area has long been circumscribed by barriers of any\r\nkind, which prevent the animals from wandering beyond it, then we find\r\nthat all the species, both extinct and living, constitute more or less a\r\nworld of their own; while, on the other hand, where the animals are free\r\nto migrate from one area to another, the course of their migrations is\r\nmarked by the origination of new species springing up _en route_, and\r\nserving to connect the older, or metropolitan, forms with the younger,\r\nor colonising, forms in the way of a graduated series. This principle,\r\nhowever, admits of being traced only in certain cases of species\r\nbelonging to the same genus, of genera belonging to the same family, or,\r\nat most, of families belonging to the same order. In other words, the\r\nmore general the structural affinity, the more general is the\r\ngeographical extension--as we should expect to be the case on the theory\r\nof descent with branching modifications, seeing that the larger, the\r\nolder, and the more diverse the group of organisms compared, the greater\r\nmust be their chances of dispersal.\r\n\r\nThese general considerations led us to contemplate more in detail the\r\ncorrelation between structural affinity and barriers to free migration.\r\nSuch barriers, of course, differ in the cases of different organisms.\r\nMarine organisms are stopped by land, unsuitable temperature, or\r\nunsuitable depths; fresh-water organisms by sea and by mountain-chains;\r\nterrestrial organisms chiefly by water. Now it is a matter of fact\r\nwhich admits of no dispute, that in each of these cases we meet with a\r\ndirect correlation between the kind of barrier and the kind of organisms\r\nwhose structural affinities are affected thereby. Where we have to do\r\nwith marine organisms, barriers such as the Isthmus of Panama and the\r\nvarying depth of the Western Pacific determine three very distinct\r\nfaunas, ranging north and south in closely parallel lines, and under\r\ncorresponding climates. Where we have to do with fresh-water organisms,\r\nwe find that a mountain-chain only a few miles wide has more influence\r\nin determining differences of organic type on either side of it than is\r\nexercised by even thousands of miles of a continuous land-area, if this\r\nbe uninterrupted by any mountains high enough to prevent water-fowl,\r\nwhirlwinds, &c., from dispersing the ova. Again, where we have to do\r\nwith terrestrial organisms, the most effectual barriers are wide reaches\r\nof ocean; and, accordingly, we find that these exercise an enormous\r\ninfluence on the modification of terrestrial types. Moreover, we find\r\nthat the _more_ terrestrial an organism, or the _greater_ the difficulty\r\nit has in traversing a wide reach of ocean, the _greater_ is the\r\nmodifying influence of such a barrier upon that type. In oceanic\r\nislands, for example, many of the plants and aquatic birds usually\r\nbelong to the same species as those which occur on the nearest\r\nmainlands, and where there are any specific differences, these but\r\nrarely run up to generic differences. But the land-birds, insects, and\r\nreptiles which are found on such islands are nearly always specifically,\r\nand very often generically, distinct from those on the nearest\r\nmainland--although invariably allied with sufficient closeness to leave\r\nno manner of doubt as to their affinities with the fauna of that\r\nmainland. Lastly, no amphibians and no mammals (except bats) are ever\r\nfound on any oceanic islands. Yet, as we have seen, on the theory of\r\nspecial creation, these islands must all be taken to have been the\r\ntheatres of the most extraordinary creative activity, so that on only\r\nthree of them we found no less than 1258 unique species, whereof 657\r\nwere unique species of land animals, to be set against one single\r\nspecies known to occur elsewhere. Nevertheless, notwithstanding this\r\nprodigious expenditure of creative energy in the case of land-birds,\r\nland-shells, insects, and reptiles, no single new amphibian, or no\r\nsingle new mammal, has been created on any single oceanic island, if we\r\nexcept the only kind of mammal that is able to fly, and the ancestors of\r\nwhich, like those of the land-birds and insects, might therefore have\r\nreached the islands ages ago. Moreover, with regard to mammals, even in\r\ncases where allied forms occur on either side of a sea-channel, it is\r\nfound to be a general rule that if the channel is shallow, the species\r\non either side of it are much more closely related than if it be\r\ndeep--and this irrespective of its width. Therefore we can only\r\nconclude, in the words of Darwin--\"As the amount of modification which\r\nanimals of all kinds undergo partly depends on lapse of time, and as the\r\nislands which are separated from each other or from the mainland by\r\nshallow channels are more likely to have been continuously united within\r\na recent period than islands separated by deeper channels, we can\r\nunderstand how it is that a relation exists between the depth of the sea\r\nseparating two mammalian faunas, and the degree of their affinity--a\r\nrelation which is quite inexplicable on the theory of independent acts\r\nof creation.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLooking to all these general principles of geographical distribution,\r\nand remembering the sundry points of smaller detail relating to oceanic\r\nislands which I will not wait to recapitulate, to my mind it seems that\r\nthere is no escape from the following conclusion, with which I will\r\nbring my brief epitome of the evidence to a close. The conclusion to\r\nwhich, I submit, all the evidence leads is, that if the doctrine of\r\nspecial creation is taken to be true, then it must be further taken that\r\nthe one and only principle which has been consistently followed in the\r\ngeographical deposition of species, is that of so depositing them as to\r\nmake it everywhere appear that they were not thus deposited at all, but\r\ncame into existence where they now occur by way of genetic descent with\r\nperpetual migration and correlative modification. On no other principle,\r\nso far as I can see, would it be possible to account for the fact that\r\n\"every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time\r\nwith a pre-existing and closely allied species,\" together with the\r\ncarefully graduated regard to physical barriers which the Creator must\r\nhave displayed while depositing his newly formed species on either sides\r\nof them--everywhere making _degrees_ of structural affinity correspond\r\nto _degrees_ of geographical continuity, and _degrees_ of structural\r\ndifference correspond to _degrees_ of geographical separation, whether\r\nby mountain-chains in the case of fresh-water faunas, by land and by\r\ndeep sea in the case of marine faunas, or by reaches of ocean in the\r\ncase of terrestrial faunas--stocking oceanic islands with an enormous\r\nprofusion of peculiar species all allied to those on the nearest\r\nmainlands, yet everywhere avoiding the creation upon them of any\r\namphibian or mammal, except an occasional bat. We are familiar with the\r\ndoctrine that God is a God who hideth himself; here, however, it seems\r\nto me, we should have but a thinly-veiled insinuation, not merely that\r\nin his works he is hidden, but that in these works he is untrue. Than\r\nwhich I cannot conceive a stronger condemnation of the theory which it\r\nhas been my object fairly to represent and dispassionately to\r\ncriticise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\n_SELECTION_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have been considering the main evidences of organic\r\nevolution considered as a fact. We now enter a new field, namely, the\r\nevidences which thus far have been brought to light touching the causes\r\nof organic evolution considered as a process.\r\n\r\nAs was pointed out in the opening chapter, this is obviously the\r\nmethodical course to follow: we must have some reasonable assurance that\r\na fact is a fact before we endeavour to explain it. Nevertheless, it is\r\nnot necessary that we should actually demonstrate a fact to be a fact\r\nbefore we endeavour to explain it. Even if we have but a reasonable\r\npresumption as to its probability, we may find it well worth while to\r\nconsider its explanation; for by so doing we may obtain additional\r\nevidence of the fact itself. And this because, if it really is a fact,\r\nand if we hit upon the right explanation of it, by proving the\r\nexplanation probable, we may thereby greatly increase our evidence of\r\nthe fact. In the very case before us, for example, the evidence of\r\nevolution as a fact has from the first been largely derived from testing\r\nDarwin's theory concerning its method. It was this theoretical\r\nexplanation of its method which first set him seriously to enquire into\r\nthe evidences of evolution as a fact; and ever since he published his\r\nresults, the evidences which he adduced in favour of natural selection\r\nas a method have constituted some of the strongest reasons which\r\nscientific men have felt for accepting evolution as a fact. Of course\r\nthe evidence in favour of this fact has gone on steadily growing, quite\r\nindependently of the assistance which was thus so largely lent to it by\r\nthe distinctively Darwinian theory of its method; and, indeed, so much\r\nhas this been the case, that in the present treatise we have been able\r\nto consider such direct evidence of the fact itself, without any\r\nreference at all to the indirect or accessory evidence which is derived\r\nfrom that of natural selection as a method. From which it follows that\r\nin most of what I am about to say in subsequent chapters on the\r\nevidences of natural selection as a method, there will be furnished a\r\nlarge addition to the evidences which have already been detailed of\r\nevolution as a fact. But, as a matter of systematic treatment, I have\r\nthought it desirable to keep these two branches of our subject separate.\r\nWhich means that I have made the evidences of evolution as a fact to\r\nstand independently on their own feet--feet which in my opinion are\r\namply strong enough to bear any weight of adverse criticism that can be\r\nplaced upon them.\r\n\r\nOur position, then, is this. On the foundation of the previous chapters,\r\nI will henceforth assume that we all accept organic evolution as a fact,\r\nwithout requiring any of the accessory evidence which is gained by\r\nindependent proof of natural selection as a method. But in making this\r\nassumption--namely, that we are all now firmly persuaded of the fact of\r\nevolution--I do not imagine that such is really the case. I make the\r\nassumption for the purposes of systematic exposition, and in order that\r\ndifferent parts of the subject may be kept distinct. I confess it does\r\nappear to me remarkable that there should still be a doubt in any\r\neducated mind touching the general fact of evolution; while it becomes\r\nto me unaccountable that such should be the case with a few still living\r\nmen of science, who cannot be accused of being ignorant of the evidences\r\nwhich have now been accumulated. But in whatever measure we may\r\nseverally have been convinced--or remained unconvinced--on this matter,\r\nfor the purposes of exposition I must hereafter assume that we are all\r\nagreed to the extent of regarding the process of evolution as, at least,\r\nsufficiently probable to justify enquiry touching its causes on\r\nsupposition of its truth.\r\n\r\nNow, the causes of evolution have been set forth in a variety of\r\ndifferent hypotheses, only the chief of which need be mentioned here.\r\nHistorically speaking the first of these was that which was put forward\r\nby Erasmus Darwin, Lamarck, and Herbert Spencer. It consists in putting\r\ntogether the following facts and inferences.\r\n\r\nWe know that, in the lifetime of the individual, increased use of\r\nstructures leads to an increase of their functional efficiency; while,\r\non the other hand, disuse leads to atrophy. The arms of a blacksmith,\r\nand the legs of a mountaineer, are familiar illustrations of the first\r\nprinciple: our hospital wards are full of illustrations of the second.\r\nAgain, we know that the characters of parents are transmitted to their\r\nprogeny by means of heredity. Now the hypothesis in question consists\r\nin supposing that if any particular organs in a species are habitually\r\nused for performing any particular action, they must undergo a\r\nstructural improvement which would more and more adapt them to the\r\nperformance of that action; for in each generation constant use would\r\nbetter and better adapt the structures to the discharge of their\r\nfunctions, and they would then be bequeathed to the next generation in\r\nthis their improved form by heredity. So that, for instance, if there\r\nhad been a thousand generations of blacksmiths, we might expect the sons\r\nof the last of them to inherit unusually strong arms, even if these\r\nyoung men had themselves taken to some other trade not requiring any\r\nspecial use of their arms. Similarly, if there had been a thousand\r\ngenerations of men who used their arms but slightly, we should expect\r\ntheir descendants to show but a puny development of the upper\r\nextremities. Now let us apply all this to the animal kingdom in general.\r\nThe giraffe, for instance, is a ruminant whose entire frame has been\r\nadapted to support an enormously long neck, which is of use to the\r\nanimal in reaching the foliage of trees. The ancestors of the giraffe,\r\nhaving had ordinary necks, were supposed by Lamarck to have gradually\r\nincreased the length of them, through many successive generations, by\r\nconstantly stretching to reach high foliage; and he further supposed\r\nthat, when the neck became so long as to require for its support special\r\nchanges in the general form of the animal as a whole, these special\r\nchanges would have brought about the dwindling of other parts from which\r\nso much activity was no longer required--the general result being that\r\nthe whole organization of the animal became more and more adapted to\r\nbrowsing on high foliage. And so in the cases of other animals, Lamarck\r\nbelieved that the adaptation of their forms to their habits could be\r\nexplained by this simple hypothesis that the habits created the forms,\r\nthrough the effects of use and disuse, coupled with heredity.\r\n\r\nSuch is what is ordinarily known as Lamarck's theory of evolution. We\r\nmay as well remember, however, that it really constitutes only one part\r\nof his theory; for besides this hypothesis of the cumulative inheritance\r\nof functionally-produced modifications--to which we may add the\r\ninherited effects of any direct action exercised by surrounding\r\nconditions of life,--Lamarck believed in some transcendental principle\r\ntending to produce gradual improvement in pre-determined lines of\r\nadvance. Therefore it would really be more correct to designate the\r\nformer hypothesis by the name either of Erasmus Darwin, or, still\r\nbetter, of Herbert Spencer. Nevertheless, in order to avoid confusion, I\r\nwill follow established custom, and subsequently speak of this\r\nhypothesis as the Lamarckian hypothesis--understanding, however, that in\r\nemploying this designation I am not referring to any part or factor of\r\nLamarck's general theory of evolution other than the one which has just\r\nbeen described--namely, the hypothesis of the cumulative transmission of\r\nfunctionally-produced, or otherwise \"acquired,\" modifications.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the earliest hypothesis touching the causes of organic\r\nevolution. But we may at once perceive that it is insufficient to\r\nexplain all that stands to be explained. In the first place, it refers\r\nin chief part only to the higher animals, which are actuated to effort\r\nby intelligence. Its explanatory power in the case of most\r\ninvertebrata--as well as in that of all plants--is extremely limited,\r\ninasmuch as these organisms can never be moved to a greater or less use\r\nof their several parts by any discriminating volition, such as that\r\nwhich leads to the continued straining of a giraffe's neck for the\r\npurpose of reaching foliage. In the second place, even among the higher\r\nanimals there are numberless tissues and organs which unquestionably\r\npresent a high degree of adaptive evolution, but which nevertheless\r\ncannot be supposed to have fallen within the influence of Lamarckian\r\nprinciples. Of such are the shells of crustacea, tortoises, &c., which\r\nalthough undoubtedly of great use to the animals presenting them, cannot\r\never have been _used_ in the sense required by Lamarck's hypothesis, i.\r\ne. actively exercised, so as to increase a flow of nutrition to the\r\npart. Lastly, in the third place, the validity of Lamarck's hypothesis\r\nin any case whatsoever has of late years become a matter of serious\r\nquestion, as will be fully shown and discussed in the next volume.\r\nMeanwhile it is enough to observe that, on account of all these reasons,\r\nthe theory of Lamarck, even if it be supposed to present any truth at\r\nall, is clearly insufficient as a full or complete theory of organic\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn historical order the next theory that was arrived at was the theory\r\nof natural selection, simultaneously published by Darwin and Wallace on\r\nJuly 1st, 1858.\r\n\r\nIf we may estimate the importance of an idea by the change of thought\r\nwhich it effects, this idea of natural selection is unquestionably the\r\nmost important idea that has ever been conceived by the mind of man.\r\nYet the wonder is that it should not have been hit upon long before. Or\r\nrather, I should say, the wonder is that its immense and immeasurable\r\nimportance should not have been previously recognised. For, since the\r\npublication of this idea by Darwin and Wallace, it has been found that\r\nits main features had already occurred to at least two other\r\nminds--namely, Dr. Wells in 1813, and Mr. Patrick Matthew in 1831. But\r\nneither of these writers perceived that in the few scattered sentences\r\nwhich they had written upon the subject they had struck the key-note of\r\norganic nature, and resolved one of the principal chords of the\r\nuniverse. Still more remarkable is the fact that Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer--notwithstanding his great powers of abstract thought and his\r\ngreat devotion of those powers to the theory of evolution, when as yet\r\nthis theory was scorned by science--still more remarkable, I say, is the\r\nfact that Mr. Herbert Spencer should have missed what now appears so\r\nobvious an idea. But most remarkable of all is the fact that Dr.\r\nWhewell, with all his stores of information on the history of the\r\ninductive sciences, and with all his acumen on the matter of scientific\r\nmethod, should not only have conceived the idea of natural selection,\r\nbut expressly stated it as a logically possible explanation of the\r\norigin of species, and yet have so stated it merely for the purpose of\r\ndismissing it with contempt[26]. This, I think, is most remarkable,\r\nbecause it serves to prove how very far men's minds at that time must\r\nhave been from entertaining, as in any way antecedently probable, the\r\ndoctrine of transmutation. In order to show this I will here quote one\r\npassage from the writings of Whewell, and another from a distinguished\r\nFrench naturalist referred to by him.\r\n\r\n    [26] For quotations, see Note A.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Whewell wrote:--\r\n\r\n     Not only is the doctrine of the transmutation of species in itself\r\n     disproved by the best physiological reasonings, but the additional\r\n     assumptions which are requisite to enable its advocates to apply it\r\n     to the explanation of the geological and other phenomena of the\r\n     earth, are altogether gratuitous and fantastical[27].\r\n\r\n    [27] whewell, _indications of the creator_, 2nd ed., 1846.\r\n\r\nThen he quotes with approval the following opinion:--\r\n\r\n     Against this hypothesis, which, up to the present time, I regard as\r\n     purely gratuitous, and likely to turn geologists out of the sound\r\n     and excellent road in which they now are, I willingly raise my\r\n     voice, with the most absolute conviction of being in the right[28].\r\n\r\n    [28] de blainville, _compte rendu_, 1837.\r\n\r\nAnd, after displaying the proof rendered by Lyell of uniformitarianism\r\nin geology, and cordially subscribing thereto, Whewell adds:--\r\n\r\n     We are led by our reasonings to this view, that the present order\r\n     of things was commenced by an act of creative power entirely\r\n     different to any agency which has been exerted since. None of the\r\n     influences which have modified the present races of animals and\r\n     plants since they were placed in their habitations on the earth's\r\n     surface can have had any efficacy in producing them at first. We\r\n     are necessarily driven to assume, as the beginning of the present\r\n     cycle of organic nature, an event not included in the course of\r\n     nature[29].\r\n\r\n    [29] Whewell, _ibid._, p. 162.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the state of the most enlightened and representative\r\nopinions on the question of evolution before the publication of\r\nDarwin's work; and so much, likewise, for the only reasonable\r\nsuggestions as to the causes of evolution which up to that time had been\r\nput forward, even by those few individuals who entertained any belief in\r\nevolution as a fact. It was the theory of natural selection that changed\r\nall this, and created a revolution in the thought of our time, the\r\nmagnitude of which in many of its far-reaching consequences we are not\r\neven yet in a position to appreciate; but the action of which has\r\nalready wrought a transformation in general philosophy, as well as in\r\nthe more special science of biology, that is without a parallel in the\r\nhistory of mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough every one is now more or less well acquainted with the theory\r\nof natural selection, it is necessary, for the sake of completeness,\r\nthat I should state the theory; and I will do so in full detail.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of observable fact that all plants and animals are\r\nperpetually engaged in what Darwin calls a \"struggle for existence.\"\r\nThat is to say, in every generation of every species a great many more\r\nindividuals are born than can possibly survive; so that there is in\r\nconsequence a perpetual battle for life going on among all the\r\nconstituent individuals of any given generation. Now, in this struggle\r\nfor existence, which individuals will be victorious and live? Assuredly\r\nthose which are best fitted to live, in whatever respect, or respects,\r\ntheir superiority of fitness may consist. Hence it follows that Nature,\r\nso to speak, _selects_ the best individuals out of each generation to\r\nlive. And not only so; but as these favoured individuals transmit their\r\nfavourable qualities to their offspring, according to the fixed laws of\r\nheredity, it further follows that the individuals composing each\r\nsuccessive generation have a general tendency to be better suited to\r\ntheir surroundings than were their forefathers. And this follows, not\r\nmerely because in every generation it is only the \"flower of the flock\"\r\nthat is allowed to breed, but also because, if in any generation some\r\nnew and beneficial qualities happen to arise as slight variations from\r\nthe ancestral type, they will (other things permitting) be seized upon\r\nby natural selection, and, being transmitted by heredity to subsequent\r\ngenerations, will be added to the previously existing type. Thus the\r\nbest idea of the whole process will be gained by comparing it with the\r\nclosely analogous process whereby gardeners, fanciers, and\r\ncattle-breeders create their wonderful productions; for just as these\r\nmen, by always \"_selecting_\" their best individuals to breed from,\r\nslowly but continuously improve their stock, so Nature, by a similar\r\nprocess of \"_selection_\" slowly but continuously makes the various\r\nspecies of plants and animals better and better suited to the conditions\r\nof their life.\r\n\r\nNow, if this process of continuously adapting organisms to their\r\nenvironment takes place in nature at all, there is no reason why we\r\nshould set any limits on the extent to which it is able to go, up to the\r\npoint at which a complete and perfect adaptation is achieved. Therefore\r\nwe might suppose that all species would eventually reach this condition\r\nof perfect harmony with their environment, and then remain fixed. And\r\nso, according to the theory, they would, if the environment were itself\r\nunchanging. But forasmuch as the environment (i. e. the sum total of the\r\nexternal conditions of life) of almost every organic type alters more\r\nor less from century to century--whether from astronomical, geological,\r\nand geographical changes, or from the immigrations and emigrations of\r\nother species living on contiguous areas, and so on--it follows that the\r\nprocess of natural selection need never reach a terminal phase. And\r\nforasmuch as natural selection may thus continue, _ad infinitum_, slowly\r\nto alter a specific type in adaptation to a gradually changing\r\nenvironment, if in any case the alteration thus effected is sufficient\r\nin amount to lead naturalists to name the result as a distinct species,\r\nit follows that natural selection has transmuted one specific type into\r\nanother. Similarly, by a continuation of the process, specific types\r\nwould become transmuted into generic, generic into family types, and so\r\non. Thus the process is supposed to go on throughout all the countless\r\nforms of life continuously and simultaneously--the world of organic\r\ntypes being thus regarded as in a state of perpetual, though gradual,\r\nflux.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, the first thing we have to notice about this theory is, that in all\r\nits main elements it is merely a statement of observable facts. It is an\r\nobservable fact that in all species of plants and animals a very much\r\nlarger number of individuals are born than can possibly survive. Thus,\r\nfor example, it has been calculated that if the progeny of a single pair\r\nof elephants--which are the slowest breeding of animals--were all\r\nallowed to reach maturity and propagate, in 750 years there would be\r\nliving 19,000,000 descendants. Again, in the case of vegetables, if a\r\nspecies of annual plant produces only two seeds a year, if these in\r\nsuccessive years were all allowed to reproduce their kind, in twenty\r\nyears there would be 11,000,000 plants from a single ancestor. Yet we\r\nknow that nearly all animals and plants produce many more young at a\r\ntime than in either of these two supposed cases. Indeed, as individuals\r\nof many kinds of plants, and not a few kinds of animals, produce every\r\nyear several thousand young, we may make a rough estimate and say, that\r\nover organic nature as a whole probably not one in a thousand young are\r\nallowed to survive to the age of reproduction. How tremendous,\r\ntherefore, must be the struggle for existence! It is thought a terrible\r\nthing in battle when one half the whole number of combatants perish. But\r\nwhat are we to think of a battle for life where only one in a thousand\r\nsurvives?\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the first fact. The second is the fact so long ago\r\nrecognised, that the battle is to the strong, the race to the swift. The\r\nthousandth individual which does survive in the battle for\r\nexistence--which does win the race for life--is, without question, one\r\nof the individuals best fitted to do so; that is to say, best fitted to\r\nthe conditions of its existence considered as a whole. Nature is,\r\ntherefore, always picking out, or selecting, such individuals to live\r\nand to breed.\r\n\r\nThe third fact is, that the individuals so selected transmit their\r\nfavourable qualities to their offspring by heredity. There is no doubt\r\nabout this fact, so far as we are concerned with it. For although, as I\r\nhave already hinted, considerable doubt has of late years been cast upon\r\nLamarck's doctrine of the hereditary transmission of _acquired_\r\ncharacters, it remains as impossible as ever it was to question the\r\nhereditary transmission of what are called _congenital_ characters. And\r\nthis is all that Darwin's theory necessarily requires.\r\n\r\nThe fourth fact is, that although heredity as a whole produces a\r\nwonderfully exact copy of the parent in the child, there is never a\r\nprecise reduplication. Of all the millions of human beings upon the face\r\nof the earth, no one is so like another that we cannot see some\r\ndifference; the resemblance is everywhere specific, nowhere individual.\r\nNow this same remark applies to all specific types. The only reason why\r\nwe notice individual differences in the case of the human type more than\r\nwe do in the case of any other types, is because our attention is here\r\nmore incessantly focussed upon these differences. We are compelled to\r\nnotice them in the case of our own species, however small they may\r\nappear to a naturalist, because, unless we do so, we should not\r\nrecognise the members of our own family, or be able to distinguish\r\nbetween a man whom we know is ready to do us an important service, and\r\nanother man whom we know is ready to cut our throats. But our common\r\nmother Nature is able thus to distinguish between all her children. Her\r\neyes are much more ready to detect small individual peculiarities than\r\nare the eyes of any naturalist. No slight variations in the cast of\r\nfeature or disposition of parts, no minute difference in the arrangement\r\nof microscopical cells, can escape her ever vigilant attention. And,\r\nconsequently, when among all the innumerable multitudes of individual\r\nvariations any one arises which--no matter in how slight a degree--gives\r\nto that individual a better chance of success in the struggle for life,\r\nNature chooses that individual to survive, and so to perpetuate the\r\nimprovement in his or her progeny.\r\n\r\nNow I say that all these several component parts of Darwinian doctrine\r\nare not matters of theory, but matters of fact. The only element of\r\ntheory in his doctrine of evolution by natural selection has reference\r\nto the degree in which these observable facts, when thus brought\r\ntogether, are adequate to account for the process of evolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much, then, as a statement of the theory of natural selection. But\r\nfrom this statement--i. e. from the theory of natural selection\r\nitself--there follow certain matters of general principle which it is\r\nimportant to bear in mind. These, therefore, I shall here proceed to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is evident that the theory is applicable as an\r\nexplanation of organic changes in specific types only in so far as these\r\nchanges are of _use_, or so far as such changes endow the species with\r\nbetter chances of success in the general struggle for existence. This is\r\nthe only sense in which I shall always employ the terms use, utility,\r\nservice, benefit, and so forth--that is to say, in the sense of\r\nlife-preserving.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext, it must be clearly understood that the life which it is the\r\nobject, so to speak, of natural selection to preserve, is primarily the\r\nlife of the _species_; not that of the _individual_. Natural selection\r\npreserves the life of the individual only in so far as this is conducive\r\nto that of the species. Wherever the life-interests of the individual\r\nclash with those of the species, that individual is sacrificed in favour\r\nof others who happen better to subserve the interests of the species.\r\nFor example, in all organisms a greater or less amount of vigour is\r\nwasted, so far as individual interests are concerned, in the formation\r\nand the nourishment of progeny. In the great majority of plants and\r\nanimals an enormous amount of physiological energy is thus expended.\r\nLook at the roe or the milt of a herring, for instance, and see what a\r\nhuge drain has been made upon the individual for the sake of its\r\nspecies. Again, all unselfish instincts have been developed for the sake\r\nof the species, and usually against the interests of the individual. An\r\nant which will allow her head to be slowly drawn from her body rather\r\nthan relinquish her hold upon a pupa, is clearly acting in response to\r\nan instinct which has been developed for the benefit of the hive, though\r\nfatal to the individual. And, in a lesser degree, the parental\r\ninstincts, wherever they occur, are more or less detrimental to the\r\ninterests of the individual, though correspondingly essential to those\r\nof the race.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations will serve to show that natural selection always\r\nworks primarily for the life-interests of the species--and, indeed, only\r\nworks for those of the individual at all in so far as the latter happen\r\nto coincide with the former. Or, otherwise stated, the object of natural\r\nselection is always that of producing and maintaining specific types in\r\nthe highest degree of efficiency, no matter what may become of the\r\nconstituent individuals. Which is a striking republication by Science of\r\na general truth previously stated by Poetry:--\r\n\r\n    So careful of the type she seems,\r\n    So careless of the single life.\r\n\r\nTennyson thus noted the fact, and a few years later Darwin supplied the\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nBut of course in many, if not in the majority of cases, anything that\r\nadds to the life-sustaining power of the single life thereby ministers\r\nalso to the life-sustaining power of the type; and thus we can\r\nunderstand why all mechanisms and instincts which minister to the single\r\nlife have been developed--namely, because the life of the species is\r\nmade up of the lives of all its constituent individuals. It is only\r\nwhere the interests of the one clash with those of the other that\r\nnatural selection works against the individual. So long as the interests\r\nare coincident, it works in favour of both.\r\n\r\nNatural selection, then, is a theory which seeks to explain by natural\r\ncauses the occurrence of every kind of adaptation which is to be met\r\nwith in organic nature, on the assumption that adaptations of every kind\r\nhave primary reference to the preservation of species, and therefore\r\nalso, as a general rule, to the preservation of their constituent\r\nindividuals. And from this it follows that where it is for the benefit\r\nof a species to change its type, natural selection will effect that\r\nchange, thus leading to a specific transmutation, or the evolution of a\r\nnew species. In such cases the old species may or may not become\r\nextinct. If the transmutation affects the species as a whole, or\r\nthroughout its entire range, of course _that_ particular type becomes\r\nextinct, although it does so by becoming changed into a still more\r\nsuitable type in the course of successive generations. If, on the other\r\nhand, the transmutation affects only a part of the original species, or\r\nnot throughout its entire range, then the other parts of that species\r\nmay survive for any number of ages as they originally were. In the one\r\ncase there is a ladder-like transmutation of species in time; in the\r\nother case a possibly tree-like multiplication of species in space. But\r\nwhether the evolution of species be thus serial in time or divergent in\r\nspace, the object of natural selection, so to speak, is in either case\r\nthe same--namely, that of preserving all types which prove best suited\r\nto the conditions of their existence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce more, the term \"struggle for existence\" must be understood to\r\ncomprehend, not only a competition for life among contemporary\r\nindividuals of the same species, but likewise a struggle by all such\r\nindividuals taken collectively for the continuance of their own specific\r\ntype. Thus, on the one hand, while there is a perpetual civil war being\r\nwaged between members of the same species, on the other hand there is a\r\nforeign war being waged by the species as a whole against its world as a\r\nwhole. Hence it follows that natural selection does not secure survival\r\nof the fittest as regards individuals only, but also survival of the\r\nfittest as regards types. This is a most important point to remember,\r\nbecause, as a general rule, these two different causes produce exactly\r\nopposite effects. Success in the civil war, where each is fighting\r\nagainst all, is determined by _individual_ fitness and _self-reliance_.\r\nBut success in the foreign war is determined by what may be termed\r\n_tribal_ fitness and _mutual dependence_. For example, among social\r\ninsects the struggle for existence is quite as great between different\r\ntribes or communities, as it is between different individuals of the\r\nsame community; and thus we can understand the extraordinary degree in\r\nwhich not only co-operative instincts, but also largely intelligent\r\nsocial habits, have here been developed[30]. Similarly, in the case of\r\nmankind, we can understand the still more extraordinary development of\r\nthese things--culminating in the moral sense. I have heard a sermon,\r\npreached at one of the meetings of the British Association, entirely\r\ndevoted to arguing that the moral sense could not have been evolved by\r\nnatural selection, seeing that the altruism which this sense involves is\r\nthe very opposite of selfishness, which alone ought to have been the\r\nproduct of survival of the fittest in a struggle for life. And, of\r\ncourse, this argument would have been perfectly sound had Darwin limited\r\nthe struggle for existence to individuals, without extending it to\r\ncommunities. But if the preacher had ever read Darwin's works he would\r\nhave found that, when thus extended, the principle of natural selection\r\nis bound to work in favour of the co-operative instincts in the case of\r\nso highly social an animal as man; and that of these instincts\r\nconscience is the highest imaginable exhibition.\r\n\r\n    [30] For cases, see _Animal Intelligence_, in the chapters on Ants\r\n    and Bees; and, for discussion of principles, _Mental Evolution in\r\n    Animals_, in the chapters on Instinct.\r\n\r\nWhat I have called tribal fitness--in contradistinction to individual\r\nfitness--begins with the family, developes in the community (herd, hive,\r\nclan, &c.), and usually ends with the limits of the species. On the one\r\nhand, however, it is but seldom that it extends so far as to embrace the\r\nentire species; while, on the other hand, it may in some cases, and as\r\nit were sporadically, extend beyond the species. In these latter cases\r\nmembers of different species mutually assist one another, whether in the\r\nway of what is called symbiosis, or in a variety of other ways which I\r\nneed not wait to mention. For the only point which I now desire to make\r\nclear is, that all cases of mutual aid or co-operation, whether within\r\nor beyond the limits of species, are cases which fall under the\r\nexplanatory sweep of the Darwinian theory[31].\r\n\r\n    [31] Prince Kropotkin in the _Nineteenth Century_ (Feb. 1888, Apr.\r\n    1891) has adduced a large and interesting body of facts, showing the\r\n    great prevalence of the principle of co-operation in organic\r\n    nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother important point to notice is, that it constitutes no part of the\r\ntheory of natural selection to suppose that survival of the fittest must\r\ninvariably lead to _improvement_ of type, in the sense of superior\r\norganization. On the contrary, if from change of habits or conditions of\r\nlife an organic type ceases to have any use for previously useful\r\norgans, natural selection will not only allow these organs in successive\r\ngenerations to deteriorate--by no longer placing any selective premium\r\nupon their maintenance--but may even proceed to assist the agencies\r\nengaged in their destruction. For, being now useless, they may become\r\neven deleterious, by absorbing nutriment, causing weight, occupying\r\nspace, &c., without conferring any compensating benefit. Thus we can\r\nunderstand why it is that parasites, for example, present the phenomena\r\nof what is called _degeneration_, i. e. showing by their whole structure\r\nthat they have descended from a possibly very much higher type of\r\norganization than that which they now exhibit. Having for innumerable\r\ngenerations ceased to require their legs, their eyes, and so forth, all\r\nsuch organs of high elaboration have either disappeared or become\r\nvestigial, leaving the parasite as a more or less effete representative\r\nof its ancestry.\r\n\r\nThese facts of degeneration, as we have previously seen, are of very\r\ngeneral occurrence, and it is evident that their importance in the field\r\nof organic evolution as a whole has been very great. Moreover, it ought\r\nto be particularly observed that, as just indicated, the facts may be\r\ndue either to a passive _cessation_ of selection, or to an active\r\n_reversal_ of it. Or, more correctly, these facts are probably _always_\r\ndue to the cessation of selection, although in most cases where species\r\nin a state of nature are concerned, the process of degeneration has been\r\nboth hastened and intensified by the super-added influence of the\r\nreversal of selection. In the next volume I shall have occasion to recur\r\nto this distinction, when it will be seen that it is one of no small\r\nimportance to the general theory of descent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to consider certain misconceptions of the Darwinian\r\ntheory which are largely, not to say generally, prevalent among\r\nsupporters of the theory. These misconceptions, therefore, differ from\r\nthose which fall to be considered in the next chapter, i. e.\r\nmisconceptions which constitute grounds of objection to the theory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all the errors connected with the theory of natural selection,\r\nperhaps the one most frequently met with--especially among supporters of\r\nthe theory--is that of employing the theory to explain all cases of\r\nphyletic modification (or inherited change of type) indiscriminately,\r\nwithout waiting to consider whether in particular cases its application\r\nis so much as logically possible. The term \"natural selection\" thus\r\nbecomes a magic word, or Sesame, at the utterance of which every closed\r\ndoor is supposed to be immediately opened. Be it observed, I am not here\r\nalluding to that merely blind faith in natural selection, which of late\r\nyears has begun dogmatically to force this principle as the sole cause\r\nof organic evolution in every case where it is _logically possible_ that\r\nthe principle can have come into play. Such a blind faith, indeed, I\r\nhold to be highly inimical, not only to the progress of biological\r\nscience, but even to the true interests of the natural selection theory\r\nitself. As to this I shall have a good deal to say in the next volume.\r\nHere, however, the point is, that the theory in question is often\r\ninvoked in cases where it is not even logically possible that it can\r\napply, and therefore in cases where its application betokens, not merely\r\nan error of judgment or extravagance of dogmatism, but a fallacy of\r\nreasoning in the nature of a logical contradiction. Almost any number of\r\nexamples might be given; but one will suffice to illustrate what is\r\nmeant. And I choose it from the writings of one of the authors of the\r\nselection theory itself, in order to show how easy it is to be cheated\r\nby this mere juggling with a phrase--for of course I do not doubt that a\r\nmoment's thought would have shown the writer the untenability of his\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nIn his most recent work Mr. Wallace advances an interesting hypothesis\r\nto the effect that differences of colour between allied species, which\r\nare apparently too slight to serve any other purpose, may act as\r\n\"recognition marks,\" whereby the opposite sexes are enabled at once to\r\ndistinguish between members of their own and of closely resembling\r\nspecies. Of course this hypothesis can only apply to the higher animals;\r\nbut the point here is that, supposing it to hold for them, Mr. Wallace\r\nproceeds to argue thus:--Recognition marks \"have in all probability been\r\nacquired in the process of differentiation for the purpose of checking\r\nthe intercrossing of allied forms,\" because \"one of the first needs of a\r\nnew species would be to keep separate from its nearest allies, and this\r\ncould be more readily done by some easily seen external mark[32].\"\r\nNow, it is clearly not so much as logically possible that these\r\nrecognition-marks (supposing them to be such) can have been acquired\r\nby natural selection, \"for the purpose of checking intercrossing of\r\nallied forms.\" For the theory of natural selection, from its own\r\nessential nature as a theory, is logically exclusive of the supposition\r\nthat survival of the fittest ever provides changes in anticipation of\r\nfuture uses. Or, otherwise stated, it involves a contradiction of the\r\ntheory itself to say that the colour-changes in question were originated\r\nby natural selection, in order to meet \"one of the _first_ needs of a\r\n_new_ species,\" or for the purpose of _subsequently_ preventing\r\nintercrossing with allied forms. If it had been said that these\r\ncolour-differentiations were originated by some cause other than natural\r\nselection (or, if by natural selection, still with regard to some\r\n_previous_, instead of _prophetic_, \"purpose\"), and, when so \"acquired,\"\r\n_then_ began to serve the \"purpose\" assigned, the argument would not\r\nhave involved the fallacy which we are now considering. But, as it\r\nstands, the argument reverts to the teleology of pre-Darwinian days--or\r\nthe hypothesis of a \"purpose\" in the literal sense which sees the end\r\nfrom the beginning, instead of a \"purpose\" in the metaphorical sense of\r\nan adaptation that is evolved by the very modifications which subserve\r\nit[33].\r\n\r\n    [32] _Darwinism_, pp. 218 and 227.\r\n\r\n    [33] Since the above was written Prof. Lloyd Morgan has published a\r\n    closely similar notice of the passage in question. \"This language,\"\r\n    he says, \"seems to savour of teleology (that pitfall of the\r\n    evolutionist). The cart is put before the horse. The\r\n    recognition-marks were, I believe, not produced to prevent\r\n    intercrossing, but intercrossing has been prevented because of\r\n    preferential mating between individuals possessing special\r\n    recognition-marks. To miss this point is to miss an important\r\n    segregation-factor.\"--(_Animal Life and Intelligence_, p. 103.)\r\n    Again, on pp. 184-9, he furnishes an excellent discussion on the\r\n    whole subject of the fallacy alluded to in the text, and gives\r\n    illustrative quotations from other prominent Darwinians. I should\r\n    like to add that Darwin himself has nowhere fallen into this, or any\r\n    of the other fallacies, which are mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother very prevalent, and more deliberate, fallacy connected with the\r\ntheory of natural selection is, _that it follows deductively from the\r\ntheory itself_ that the principle of natural selection must be the sole\r\nmeans of modification in all cases where modification is of an\r\n_adaptive_ kind,--with the consequence that no other principle can ever\r\nhave been concerned in the production of structures or instincts which\r\nare of any use to their possessors. Whether or not natural selection\r\nactually has been the sole means of adaptive modification in the race,\r\nas distinguished from the individual, is a question of biological\r\nfact[34]; but it involves a grave error of reasoning to suppose that\r\nthis question can be answered deductively from the theory of natural\r\nselection itself, as I shall show at some length in the next volume.\r\n\r\n    [34] Of course adaptive modifications produced in the individual\r\n    lifetime, and not _inherited_, do not concern the question at all.\r\n    In this and the following paragraphs, therefore, \"adaptations,\"\r\n    \"adaptive modifications,\" &c., refer exclusively to such as are\r\n    hereditary, i. e. phyletic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA still more extravagant, and a still more unaccountable fallacy is the\r\none which represents it as following deductively from the theory of\r\nnatural selection itself, that all _hereditary_ characters are\r\n\"necessarily\" due to natural selection. In other words, not only all\r\nadaptive, but likewise all non-adaptive hereditary characters, it is\r\nsaid, _must_ be due to natural selection. For non-adaptive characters\r\nare taken to be due to \"correlation of growth,\" in connexion with some\r\nof the adaptive ones--natural selection being thus the _indirect_ means\r\nof producing the former _wherever_ they may occur, on account of its\r\nbeing the _direct_ and the _only_ means of producing the latter. Thus it\r\nis deduced from the theory of natural selection itself,--1st, that the\r\nprinciple of natural selection is the only possible cause of adaptive\r\nmodification: 2nd, that non-adaptive modifications can only occur in the\r\nrace as correlated appendages to the adaptive: 3rd, that, consequently,\r\nnatural selection is the only possible cause of modification, whether\r\nadaptive or non-adaptive. Here again, therefore, we must observe that\r\nnone of these sweeping generalizations can possibly be justified by\r\ndeductive reasoning from the theory of natural selection itself. Any\r\nattempt at such deductive reasoning must necessarily end in circular\r\nreasoning, as I shall likewise show in the second volume, where this\r\nwhole \"question of utility\" will be thoroughly dealt with.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce more, there is an important oversight very generally committed by\r\nthe followers of Darwin. For even those who avoid the fallacies above\r\nmentioned often fail to perceive, that natural selection can only begin\r\nto operate if the _degree_ of adaptation is already given as\r\nsufficiently high to count for something in the struggle for\r\n_existence_. Any adaptations which fall below this level of importance\r\ncannot possibly have been produced by survival of the fittest. Yet the\r\nfollowers of Darwin habitually speak of adaptative characters, which _in\r\ntheir own opinion_ are subservient merely to comfort or convenience, as\r\nhaving been produced by such means. Clearly this is illogical; for it\r\nbelongs to the essence of Darwin's theory to suppose, that natural\r\nselection can have no jurisdiction beyond the line where structures or\r\ninstincts already present a sufficient degree of adaptational value to\r\nincrease, in some measure, the expectation of life on the part of their\r\npossessors. We cannot speak of adaptations as due to natural selection,\r\nwithout thereby affirming that they present what I have elsewhere termed\r\na \"selection value.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLastly, as a mere matter of logical definition, it is well-nigh\r\nself-evident that the theory of natural selection is a theory of the\r\norigin, and cumulative development, of _adaptations_, whether these be\r\ndistinctive of species, or of genera, orders, families, classes, and\r\nsub-kingdoms. It is only when the adaptations happen to be distinctive\r\nof the first (or lowest) of these taxonomic divisions, that the theory\r\nwhich accounts for _these_ adaptations accounts also for the forms which\r\npresent them,--i. e. becomes _also_ a theory of the origin of species.\r\nThis, however, is clearly but an accident of particular cases; and,\r\ntherefore, even in them the theory is _primarily_ a theory of\r\nadaptations, while it is but secondarily a theory of the species which\r\npresent them. Or, otherwise stated, the theory is no more a theory of\r\nthe origin of species than it is of the origin of genera, families, and\r\nthe rest; while, on the other hand, it is _everywhere_ a theory of the\r\nadaptive modifications whereby each of these taxonomic divisions has\r\nbeen differentiated as such. Yet, sufficiently obvious as the accuracy\r\nof this definition must appear to any one who dispassionately considers\r\nit, several naturalists of high standing have denounced it in violent\r\nterms. I shall therefore have to recur to the subject at somewhat\r\ngreater length hereafter. At present it is enough merely to mention the\r\nmatter, as furnishing another and a curious illustration of the not\r\ninfrequent weakness of logical perception on the part of minds well\r\ngifted with the faculty of observation. It may be added, however, that\r\nthe definition in question is in no way hostile to the one which is\r\nvirtually given by Darwin in the title of his great work. _The Origin of\r\nSpecies by means of Natural Selection_ is beyond doubt the best title\r\nthat could have been given, because at the time when the work was\r\npublished the _fact_, no less than the _method_, of organic evolution\r\nhad to be established; and hence the most important thing to be done at\r\nthat time was to prove the transmutation of species. But now that this\r\nhas been done to the satisfaction of naturalists in general, it is as I\r\nhave said, curious to find some of them denouncing a wider definition of\r\nthe principle of natural selection, merely because the narrower (or\r\nincluded) definition is invested with the charm of verbal\r\nassociations[35].\r\n\r\n    [35] The question as to whether natural selection has been the only\r\n    principle concerned in the origination of species, is quite distinct\r\n    from that as to the accuracy of the above definition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much for fallacies and misconceptions touching Darwin's theory, which\r\nare but too frequently met with in the writings of its supporters. We\r\nmust now pass on to mention some of the still greater fallacies and\r\nmisconceptions which are prevalent in the writings of its opponents.\r\nAnd, in order to do this thoroughly, I shall begin by devoting the\r\nremainder of the present chapter to a consideration of the antecedent\r\nstanding of the two theories of natural selection and supernatural\r\ndesign. This having been done, in the succeeding chapters I shall deal\r\nwith the evidences for, and the objections against, the former theory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeginning, then, with the antecedent standing of these alternative\r\ntheories, the first thing to be noticed is, that they are both concerned\r\nwith the same subject-matter, which it is their common object to\r\nexplain. Moreover, this subject-matter is clearly and sharply divisible\r\ninto two great classes of facts in organic nature--namely, those of\r\nAdaptation and those of Beauty. Darwin's theory of descent explains the\r\nformer by his doctrine of natural selection, and the latter by his\r\ndoctrine of sexual selection. In the first instance, therefore, I shall\r\nhave to deal only with the facts of adaptation, leaving for subsequent\r\nconsideration the facts of beauty.\r\n\r\nInnumerable cases of the adaptation of organisms to their surroundings\r\nbeing the facts which now stand before us to be explained either by\r\nnatural selection or by supernatural intention, we may first consider a\r\nstatement which is frequently met with--namely, that even if all such\r\ncases of adaptation were proved to be fully explicable by the theory of\r\ndescent, this would constitute no disproof of the theory of design: all\r\nthe cases of adaptation, it is argued, might still be due to design,\r\neven though they admit of being hypothetically accounted for by the\r\ntheory of descent. I have heard an eminent Professor tell his class that\r\nthe many instances of mechanical adaptation discovered and described by\r\nDarwin as occurring in orchids, seemed to him to furnish better proof of\r\nsupernatural contrivance than of natural causes; and another eminent\r\nProfessor has informed me that, although he had read the _Origin of\r\nSpecies_ with care, he could see in it no evidence of natural selection\r\nwhich might not equally well have been adduced in favour of intelligent\r\ndesign. But here we meet with a radical misconception of the whole\r\nlogical attitude of science. For, be it observed, this exception _in\r\nlimine_ to the evidence which we are about to consider does not question\r\nthat natural selection _may_ be able to do all that Darwin ascribes to\r\nit. The objection is urged against his interpretation of the facts\r\nmerely on the ground that these facts might _equally well_ be ascribed\r\nto intelligent design. And so undoubtedly they might, if we were all\r\nsimple enough to adopt a supernatural explanation whenever a natural one\r\nis found sufficient to account for the facts. Once admit the irrational\r\nprinciple that we may assume the operation of higher causes where the\r\noperation of lower ones is sufficient to explain the observed phenomena,\r\nand all our science and all our philosophy are scattered to the winds.\r\nFor the law of logic which Sir William Hamilton called the law of\r\nparsimony--or the law which forbids us to assume the operation of higher\r\ncauses when lower ones are found sufficient to explain the observed\r\neffects--this law constitutes the only barrier between science and\r\nsuperstition. It is always possible to give a hypothetical explanation\r\nof any phenomenon whatsoever, by referring it immediately to the\r\nintelligence of some supernatural agent; so that the only difference\r\nbetween the logic of science and the logic of superstition consists in\r\nscience recognising a validity in the law of parsimony which\r\nsuperstition disregards. Therefore one can have no hesitation in saying\r\nthat this way of looking at the evidence in favour of natural selection\r\nis not a scientific or a reasonable way of looking at it, but a purely\r\nsuperstitious way. Let us take, as an illustration, a perfectly parallel\r\ncase. When Kepler was unable to explain by any known causes the paths\r\ndescribed by the planets, he resorted to a supernatural explanation, and\r\nsupposed that every planet was guided in its movements by some presiding\r\nangel. But when Newton supplied a beautifully simple physical\r\nexplanation, all persons with a scientific habit of mind at once\r\nabandoned the metaphysical one. Now, to be consistent, the\r\nabove-mentioned Professors, and all who think with them, ought still to\r\nadhere to Kepler's hypothesis in preference to Newton's explanation;\r\nfor, excepting the law of parsimony, there is certainly no other\r\nlogical objection to the statement, that the movements of the planets\r\nafford as good evidence of the influence of guiding angels as they do of\r\nthe influence of gravitation.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the illogical position that, granting the evidence in\r\nfavour of natural descent and supernatural design to be equal and\r\nparallel, we should hesitate in our choice between the two theories.\r\nBut, of course, if the evidence is supposed _not_ to be equal and\r\nparallel--i. e. if it is supposed that the theory of natural selection\r\nis not so good a theory whereby to explain the facts of adaptation as is\r\nthat of supernatural design,--then the objection is no longer the one\r\nwhich we are considering. It is quite another objection, and one which\r\nis not _prima facie_ absurd. Therefore let us state clearly the distinct\r\nquestion which thus arises.\r\n\r\nInnumerable cases of adaptation of organisms to their environments are\r\nthe observed facts for which an explanation is required. To supply this\r\nexplanation, two, and only two, hypotheses are in the field. Of these\r\ntwo hypotheses one is intelligent design manifested directly in special\r\ncreation; the other is natural causation operating through countless\r\nages of the past. Now, the adaptations in question involve an\r\ninnumerable multitude of special mechanisms, in most cases even within\r\nthe limits of any one given species; but when we consider the sum of all\r\nthese mechanisms presented by organic nature as a whole, the mind must\r\nindeed be dull which does not feel astounded. For, be it further\r\nobserved, these mechanical contrivances[36] are, for the most part, no\r\nmerely simple arrangements, which might reasonably be supposed due,\r\nlike the phenomena of crystallization, to comparatively simple physical\r\ncauses. On the contrary, they everywhere and habitually exhibit so\r\ndeep-laid, so intricate, and often so remote an adaptation of means to\r\nends, that no machinery of human contrivance can properly be said to\r\nequal their perfection from a mechanical point of view. Therefore,\r\nwithout question, the hypothesis which first of all they suggest--or\r\nsuggest most readily--is the hypothesis of design. And this hypothesis\r\nbecomes virtually the only hypothesis possible, if it be assumed--as it\r\ngenerally was assumed by natural theologians of the past,--that all\r\nspecies of plants and animals were introduced into the world _suddenly_.\r\nFor it is quite inconceivable that any known cause, other than\r\nintelligent design, could be competent to turn out instantaneously any\r\none of these intricate pieces of machinery, already adapted to the\r\nperformance of its special function. But, on the other hand, if there is\r\nany evidence to show that one species becomes slowly transformed into\r\nanother--or that one set of adaptations becomes slowly changed into\r\nanother set as changing circumstances require,--then it becomes quite\r\npossible to imagine that a strictly natural causation may have had\r\nsomething to do with the matter. And this suggestion becomes greatly\r\nmore probable when we discover, from geological evidence and\r\nembryological research, that in the history both of races and of\r\nindividuals the various mechanisms in question have themselves had a\r\nhistory--beginning in the forms of most uniformity and simplicity,\r\ngradually advancing to forms more varied and complex, nowhere exhibiting\r\nany interruptions in their upward progress, until the world of organic\r\nmachinery as we now have it is seen to have been but the last phase of a\r\nlong and gradual growth, the ultimate roots of which are to be found in\r\nthe soil of undifferentiated protoplasm.\r\n\r\n    [36] It is often objected to Darwin's terminology, that it embraces\r\n    such words as \"contrivance,\" \"purpose,\" &c., which are strictly\r\n    applicable only to the processes or the products of thought. But\r\n    when it is understood that they are used in a neutral or\r\n    metaphorical sense, I cannot see that any harm arises from their\r\n    use.\r\n\r\nLastly, when there is supplied to us the suggestion of natural selection\r\nas a cause presumably adequate to account for this continuous growth in\r\nthe number, the intricacy, and the perfection of such mechanisms, it is\r\nonly the most unphilosophical mind that can refuse to pause as between\r\nthe older hypothesis of design and the newer hypothesis of descent.\r\n\r\nThus it is clear that the _a priori_ standing of the rival hypotheses of\r\nnaturalism and supernaturalism in the case of all these pieces of\r\norganic machinery, is profoundly affected by the question whether they\r\ncame into existence suddenly, or whether they did so gradually. For, if\r\nthey all came into existence suddenly, the fact would constitute\r\nwell-nigh positive proof in favour of supernaturalism, or creation by\r\ndesign; whereas, if they all came into existence gradually, this fact\r\nwould in itself constitute presumptive evidence in favour of naturalism,\r\nor of development by natural causes. And, as shown in the previous\r\nchapters, the proof that all species of plants and animals came into\r\nexistence gradually--or the proof of evolution as a fact--is simply\r\noverwhelming.\r\n\r\nFrom a still more general point of view I may state the case in another\r\nway, by borrowing and somewhat expanding an illustration which, I\r\nbelieve, was first used by Professor Huxley. If, when the tide is out,\r\nwe see lying upon the shore a long line of detached sea-weed, marking\r\nthe level which is reached by full tide, we should be free to conclude\r\nthat the separation of the sea-weed from the sand and the stones was due\r\nto the intelligent work of some one who intended to collect the sea-weed\r\nfor manure, or for any other purpose. But, on the other hand, we might\r\nexplain the fact by a purely physical cause--namely, the separation by\r\nthe sea-waves of the sea-weed from the sand and stones, in virtue of its\r\nlower specific gravity. Now, thus far the fact would be explained\r\nequally well by either hypothesis; and this fact would be the fact of\r\n_selection_. But whether we yielded our assent to the one explanation or\r\nto the other would depend upon a due consideration of all collateral\r\ncircumstances. The sea-weed might not be of a kind that is of any use to\r\nman; there might be too great a quantity of it to admit of our supposing\r\nthat it had been collected by man; the fact that it was all deposited on\r\nthe high-water-mark would in itself be highly suggestive of the agency\r\nof the sea; and so forth. Thus, in such a case any reasonable observer\r\nwould decide in favour of the physical explanation, or against the\r\nteleological one.\r\n\r\nNow the question whether organic evolution has been caused by physical\r\nagencies or by intelligent design is in precisely the same predicament.\r\nThere can be no logical doubt that, theoretically at all events, the\r\nphysical agencies which the present chapter is concerned with, and which\r\nare conveniently summed up in the term natural selection, are as\r\ncompetent to produce these so-called mechanical contrivances, and the\r\nother cases of adaptation which are to be met with in organic nature,\r\nas intelligent design could be. Hence, our choice as between these two\r\nhypotheses must be governed by a study of all collateral circumstances;\r\nthat is to say, by a study of the evidences in favour of the physical\r\nexplanation. To this study, therefore, we shall now address ourselves,\r\nin the course of the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to state the main arguments in favour of the theory\r\nof natural selection, and then, in the following chapter, the main\r\nobjections which have been urged against it.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the main arguments in favour of the theory are three in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is a matter of observation that the struggle for existence in\r\nnature does lead to the extermination of forms less fitted for the\r\nstruggle, and thus makes room for forms more fitted. This general fact\r\nmay be best observed in cases where an exotic species proves itself\r\nbetter fitted to inhabit a new country than is some endemic species\r\nwhich it exterminates. In Great Britain, for example, the so-called\r\ncommon rat is a comparatively recent importation from Norway, and it has\r\nso completely supplanted the original British rat, that it is now\r\nextremely difficult to procure a single specimen of the latter: the\r\nnative black rat has been all but exterminated by the foreign brown rat.\r\nThe same thing is constantly found in the case of imported species of\r\nplants. I have seen the river at Cambridge so choked with the inordinate\r\npropagation of a species of water-weed which had been introduced from\r\nAmerica, that considerable expense had to be incurred in order to clear\r\nthe river for traffic. In New Zealand the same thing has happened with\r\nthe European water-cress, and in Australia with the common rabbit. So it\r\nis doubtless true, as one of the natives is said to have philosophically\r\nremarked, \"the white man's rat has driven away our rat, the European fly\r\ndrives away our fly, his clover kills our grass, and so will the Maoris\r\ndisappear before the white man himself.\" Innumerable other cases to the\r\nsame effect might be quoted; and they all go to establish the fact that\r\nforms less fitted to survive succumb in their competition with forms\r\nbetter fitted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is a general consideration of the largest possible\r\nsignificance in the present connexion--namely, that among all the\r\nmillions of structures and instincts which are so invariably, and for\r\nthe most part so wonderfully, adapted to the needs of the species\r\npresenting them, we cannot find a single instance, either in the\r\nvegetable or animal kingdom, of a structure or an instinct which is\r\ndeveloped for the exclusive benefit of another species. Now this great\r\nand general fact is to my mind a fact of the most enormous, not to say\r\noverwhelming, significance. The theory of natural selection has now been\r\nbefore the world for more than thirty years, and during that time it had\r\nstood a fire of criticism such as was never encountered by any\r\nscientific theory before. From the first Darwin invited this criticism\r\nto adduce any single instance, either in the vegetable or animal\r\nkingdom, of a structure or an instinct which should unquestionably be\r\nproved to be of exclusive use to any species other than the one\r\npresenting it. He even went so far as to say that if any one such\r\ninstance could be shown he would surrender his whole theory on the\r\nstrength of it--so assured had he become, by his own prolonged\r\nresearches, that natural selection was the true agent in the production\r\nof adaptive structures, and, as such, could never have permitted such a\r\nstructure to occur in one species for the benefit of another. Now, as\r\nthis invitation has been before the world for so many years, and has not\r\nyet been answered by any naturalist, we may by this time be pretty\r\nconfident that it never will be answered. How tremendous, then, is the\r\nsignificance of this fact in its testimony to Darwin's theory! The\r\nnumber of animal and vegetable species, both living and extinct, is to\r\nbe reckoned by millions, and every one of these species presents on an\r\naverage hundreds of adaptive structures,--at least one of which in many,\r\npossibly in most, if not actually in all cases, is peculiar to the\r\nspecies that presents it. In other words, there are millions of adaptive\r\nstructures (not to speak of instincts) which are peculiar to the species\r\npresenting them, and also many more which are the common property of\r\nallied species: yet, notwithstanding this inconceivable profusion of\r\nadaptive structures in organic nature, there is no single instance that\r\nhas been pointed out of the occurrence of such a structure save for the\r\nbenefit of the species that presents it. Therefore, I say that this\r\nimmensely large and general fact speaks with literally immeasurable\r\nforce in favour of natural selection, as at all events one of the main\r\ncauses of organic evolution. For the fact is precisely what we should\r\nexpect if this theory is true, while upon no other theory can its\r\nuniversality and invariability be rendered intelligible. On the\r\nbeneficent design theory, for instance, it is inexplicable that no\r\nspecies should ever be found to present a structure or an instinct\r\nhaving primary reference to the welfare of another species, when, _ex\r\nhypothesi_, such an endless amount of thought has been displayed in the\r\ncreation of structures and instincts having primary reference to the\r\nspecies which present them. For how magnificent a display of divine\r\nbeneficence would organic nature have afforded, if all--or even\r\nsome--species had been so inter-related as to have ministered to each\r\nothers wants. Organic species might then have been likened to a\r\ncountless multitude of voices, all singing in one great harmonious\r\npsalm. But, as it is, we see absolutely no vestige of such\r\nco-ordination: every species is for itself, and for itself alone--an\r\noutcome of the always and everywhere fiercely raging struggle for life.\r\n\r\nIn order that the force of this argument may not be misapprehended, it\r\nis necessary to bear in mind that it is in no way affected by cases\r\nwhere a structure or an instinct is of primary benefit to its possessor,\r\nand then becomes of secondary benefit to some other species on account\r\nof the latter being able in some way or another to utilise its action.\r\nOf course organic nature is full of cases of this kind; but they only go\r\nto show the readiness which all species display to utilise for\r\nthemselves everything that can be turned to good account in their own\r\nenvironments, and so, among other things, the structures and instincts\r\nof other animals. For instance, it would be no answer to Darwin's\r\nchallenge if any one were to point to a hermit-crab inhabiting the\r\ncast-off shell of a mollusk; because the shell was primarily of use to\r\nthe mollusk itself, and, so far as the mollusk is concerned, the fact of\r\nits shell being afterwards of a secondary use to the crab is quite\r\nimmaterial. What Darwin's challenge requires is, that some structure or\r\ninstinct should be shown which is not merely of such secondary or\r\naccidental benefit to another species, but clearly adapted to the needs\r\nof that other species in the first instance--such, for example, as would\r\nbe the case if the tail of a rattle-snake were of no use to its\r\npossessor, while serving to warn other animals of the proximity of a\r\ndangerous creature; or, in the case of instincts, if it were true that a\r\npilot-fish accompanies a shark for the purpose of helping the shark to\r\ndiscover food. Both these instances have been alleged; but both have\r\nbeen shown untenable. And so it has proved of all the other cases which\r\nthus far have been put forward.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable of all the allegations which ever have been\r\nput forward in this connexion are those that were current with regard to\r\ninstincts before the publication of Darwin's work. These allegations are\r\nthe most remarkable, because they serve to show, in a degree which I do\r\nnot believe could be shown anywhere else, the warping power of\r\npreconceived ideas. A short time ago I happened to come across the 8th\r\nedition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, and turned up the article on\r\n\"Instinct\" there, in order to see what amount of change had been wrought\r\nwith regard to our views on this subject by the work of Darwin--the 8th\r\nedition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ having been published shortly\r\nbefore _The Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection_. I cannot\r\nwait to give any lengthy quotations from this representative exponent of\r\nscientific opinion upon the subject at that time; but its general drift\r\nmay be appreciated if I transcribe merely the short concluding\r\nparagraph, wherein he sums up his general results. Here he says:--\r\n\r\n     It thus only remains for us to regard instinct as a mental faculty,\r\n     _sui generis_, the gift of God to the lower animals, that man in\r\n     his own person, and by them, might be relieved from the meanest\r\n     drudgery of nature.\r\n\r\nNow, here we have the most extraordinary illustration that is imaginable\r\nof the obscuring influence of a preconceived idea. Because he started\r\nwith the belief that instincts _must_ have been implanted in animals for\r\nthe benefit of man, this writer, even when writing a purely scientific\r\nessay, was completely blinded to the largest, the most obvious, and the\r\nmost important of the facts which the phenomena of instinct display.\r\nFor, as a matter of fact, among all the many thousands of instincts\r\nwhich are known to occur in animals, there is no single one that can be\r\npointed to as having any special reference to man; while, on the other\r\nhand, it is equally impossible to point to one which does not refer to\r\nthe welfare of the animal presenting it. Indeed, when the point is\r\nsuggested, it seems to me surprising how few in number are the instincts\r\nof animals which have proved to be so much as of secondary or accidental\r\nbenefit to man, in the same way as skins, furs, and a whole host of\r\nother animal products are thus of secondary use to him. Therefore, this\r\nwriter not only failed to perceive the most obvious truth that every\r\ninstinct, without any single exception, has reference to the animal\r\nwhich presents it; but he also conceived a purely fictitious inversion\r\nof this truth, and wrote an essay to prove a statement which all the\r\ninstincts in the animal kingdom unite in contradicting.\r\n\r\nThis example will serve to show, in a striking manner, not only the\r\ndistance that we have travelled in our interpretation of organic nature\r\nbetween two successive editions of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, but\r\nalso the amount of verification which this fact furnishes to the theory\r\nof natural selection. For, inasmuch as it belongs to the very essence of\r\nthis theory that all adaptive characters (whether instinctive or\r\nstructural) must have reference to their own possessors, we find\r\noverpowering verification furnished to the theory by the fact now before\r\nus--namely, that immediately prior to the enunciation of this theory,\r\nthe truth that all adaptive characters have reference only to the\r\nspecies which present them was not perceived. In other words, it was the\r\ntesting of this theory by the facts of nature that _revealed_ to\r\nnaturalists the general law which the theory, as it were, predicted--the\r\ngeneral law that all adaptive characters have primary reference to the\r\nspecies which present them. And when we remember that this is a kind of\r\nverification which is furnished by millions of separate cases, the whole\r\nmass of it taken together is, as I have before said, overwhelming.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that the enormous importance of this argument\r\nin favour of natural selection as a prime factor of organic evolution\r\nhas not received the attention which it deserves. Even Darwin himself,\r\nwith his characteristic reserve, has not presented its incalculable\r\nsignificance; nor do I know any of his followers who have made any\r\napproach to an adequate use of it in their advocacy of his views. In\r\npreparing the present chapter, therefore, I have been particularly\r\ncareful not to pitch too high my own estimate of its evidential value.\r\nThat is to say, I have considered, both in the domain of structures and\r\nof instincts, what instances admit of being possibly adduced _per\r\ncontra_, or as standing outside the general law that adaptive structures\r\nand instincts are of primary use only to their possessors. In the result\r\nI can only think of two such instances. These, therefore, I will now\r\ndispose of.\r\n\r\nThe first was pointed out, and has been fully discussed, by Darwin\r\nhimself. Certain species of ants are fond of a sweet fluid that is\r\nsecreted by aphides, and they even keep the aphides as we keep cows for\r\nthe purpose of profiting by their \"milk.\" Now the point is, that the use\r\nof this sweet secretion to the aphis itself has not yet been made out.\r\nOf course, if it is of no use to the aphis, it would furnish a case\r\nwhich completely meets Darwin's own challenge. But, even if this\r\nsupposition did not stand out of analogy with all the other facts of\r\norganic nature, most of us would probably deem it prudent to hold that\r\nthe secretion must primarily be of some use to the aphis itself,\r\nalthough the matter has not been sufficiently investigated to inform us\r\nof what this use is. For, in any case, the secretion is not of any vital\r\nimportance to the ants which feed upon it: and I think but few impartial\r\nminds would go so far to save an hypothesis as to maintain, that the\r\nDivinity had imposed this drain upon the internal resources of one\r\nspecies of insect for the sole purpose of supplying a luxury to\r\nanother. On the whole, it seems most probable that the fluid is of the\r\nnature of an excretion, serving to carry off waste products. Such, at\r\nall events, was the opinion at which Darwin himself arrived, as a result\r\nof observing the facts anew, and in relation to his theory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other instance to which I have alluded as seeming at first sight\r\nlikely to answer Darwin's challenge is the formation of vegetable galls.\r\nThe great number and variety of galls agree in presenting a more or less\r\nelaborate structure, which is not only foreign to any of the uses of\r\nplant-life, but singularly and specially adapted to those of the\r\ninsect-life which they shelter. Yet they are produced by a growth of the\r\nplant itself, when suitably stimulated by the insects' inoculation--or,\r\naccording to recent observations, by emanations from the bodies of the\r\nlarvae which develop from the eggs deposited in the plant by the insect.\r\nNow, without question, this is a most remarkable fact; and if there were\r\nmany more of the like kind to be met with in organic nature, we might\r\nseriously consider whether the formation of galls should not be held to\r\nmake against the ubiquitous agency of natural selection. But inasmuch as\r\nthe formation of galls stands out as an exception to the otherwise\r\nuniversal rule of every species for itself, and for itself alone, we are\r\njustified in regarding this one apparent exception with extreme\r\nsuspicion. Indeed, I think we are justified in regarding the peculiar\r\npathological effect produced in the plant by the secretions of the\r\ninsect as having been in the first instance accidentally beneficial to\r\nthe insects. Thus, if any other effect than that of a growing tumour had\r\nbeen produced in the first instance, or if the needs of the insect\r\nprogeny had not been such as to have derived profit from being enclosed\r\nin such a tumour, then, of course, the inoculating instinct of these\r\nanimals could not have been developed by natural selection. But, given\r\nthese two conditions, and it appears to me there is nothing very much\r\nmore remarkable about an accidental correlation between the effects of a\r\nparasitic larva on a plant and the needs of that parasite, than there is\r\nbetween the similarly accidental correlation between a hydated parasite\r\nand the nutrition furnished to it by the tissues of a warm-blooded\r\nanimal. Doubtless the case of galls is somewhat more remarkable,\r\ninasmuch as the morbid growth of the plant has more concern in the\r\ncorrelation--being, in many instances, a more specialized structure on\r\nthe part of a host than occurs anywhere else, either in the animal or\r\nvegetable world. But here I may suggest that although natural selection\r\ncannot have acted upon the plant directly, so as to have produced galls\r\never better and better adapted to the needs of the insect, it may have\r\nso acted upon the plants indirectly _though the insects_. For it may\r\nvery well have been that natural selection would ever tend to preserve\r\nthose individual insects, the quality of whose emanations tended to\r\nproduce the form of galls best suited to nourish the insect progeny; and\r\nthus the character of these pathological growths may have become ever\r\nbetter and better adapted to the needs of the insects. Lastly, looking\r\nto the enormous number of relations and inter-relations between all\r\norganic species, it is scarcely to be wondered at that even so\r\nextraordinary an instance of correlation as this should have arisen thus\r\nby accident, and then have been perfected by such an _indirect_ agency\r\nof natural selection as is here suggested[37].\r\n\r\n    [37] Note B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third general class of facts which tell so immensely in favour of\r\nnatural selection as an important cause of organic evolution, are those\r\nof domestication. The art of the horticulturist, the fancier, the\r\ncattle-breeder, &c., consists in producing greater and greater\r\ndeviations from a given wild type of plant or animal, in any particular\r\ndirection that may be desired for purposes either of use or of beauty.\r\nCultivated cereals, fruits, and flowers are known to have been all\r\nderived from wild species; and, of course, the same applies to all our\r\ndomesticated varieties of animals. Yet if we compare a cabbage rose with\r\na wild rose, a golden pippin apple with a crab, a toy terrier with any\r\nspecies of wild dog, not to mention any number of other instances, there\r\ncan be no question that, if such differences had appeared in nature, the\r\norganisms presenting them would have been entitled to rank as distinct\r\nspecies--or even, in many cases, as distinct genera. Yet we know, as a\r\nmatter of fact, that all these differences have been produced by a\r\nprocess of artificial selection, or pairing, which has been continuously\r\npractised by horticulturists and breeders through a number of\r\ngenerations. It is the business of these men to note the individual\r\norganisms which show most variation in the directions required, and then\r\nto propagate from these individuals, in order that the progeny shall\r\ninherit the qualities desired. The results thus become cumulative from\r\ngeneration to generation, until we now have an astonishing manifestation\r\nof useful qualities on the one hand, and of beautiful qualities on the\r\nother, according as the organisms have been thus bred for purposes of\r\nuse or for those of beauty.\r\n\r\nNow it is immediately obvious that in these cases the process of\r\nartificial selection is precisely analogous to that of natural selection\r\n(and of sexual selection which will be considered later on), in all\r\nrespects save one: the utility or the beauty which it is the aim of\r\nartificial selection continually to enhance, is utility or beauty in\r\nrelation to the requirements or to the tastes of man; whereas the\r\nutility or the beauty which is produced by natural selection and sexual\r\nselection has reference only to the requirements or the tastes of the\r\norganisms themselves. But, with the exception of this one point of\r\ndifference, the processes and the products are identical in kind.\r\nPersevering selection by man is thus proved to be capable of creating\r\nwhat are virtually new specific types, and this in any required\r\ndirection. Hence, when we remember how severe is the struggle for\r\nexistence in nature, it becomes impossible to doubt that selection by\r\nnature is able to do at least as much as artificial selection in the way\r\nof thus creating new types out of old ones. Artificial selection,\r\nindeed, notwithstanding the many and marvellous results which it has\r\naccomplished, can only be regarded as but a feeble imitation of natural\r\nselection, which must act with so much greater vigilance and through\r\nsuch immensely greater periods of time. In a word, the proved\r\ncapabilities of artificial selection furnish, in its best conceivable\r\nform, what is called an argument _a fortiori_ in favour of natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nOr, to put it in another way, it may be said that for thousands of years\r\nmankind has been engaged in making a gigantic experiment to test, as it\r\nwere by anticipation, the theory of natural selection. For, although\r\nthis prolonged experiment has been carried on without any such intention\r\non the part of the experimenters, it is none the less an experiment in\r\nthe sense that its results now furnish an overwhelming verification of\r\nMr. Darwin's theory. That is to say, they furnish overwhelming proof of\r\nthe efficacy of the selective principle in the modification of organic\r\ntypes, when once this principle is brought steadily and continuously to\r\nbear upon a sufficiently long series of generations.\r\n\r\nIn order to furnish ocular evidence of the value of this line of\r\nverification, I have had the following series of drawings prepared.\r\nAnother and equally striking series might be made of the products of\r\nartificial selection in the case of plants; but it seems to me that the\r\ncase of animals is more than sufficient for the purpose just stated.\r\nPerhaps it is desirable to add that considerable care has been bestowed\r\nupon the execution of these portraits; and that in every case the latter\r\nhave been taken from the most typical specimens of the artificial\r\nvariety depicted. Those of them which have not been drawn directly from\r\nlife are taken from the most authoritative sources; and, before being\r\nsubmitted to the engraver, they were all examined by the best judges in\r\neach department. In none of the groups, however, have I aimed at an\r\nexhaustive representation of all the varieties: I have merely introduced\r\nrepresentatives of as many as the page would in each case accommodate.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 91.--Pigeons.

Drawn from life (_Zoological Gardens_, and prize\r\n    specimen).]\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of space have prevented, in some of the groups, strict\r\nadherence to a uniform scale--with the result that contrasts between\r\ndifferent breeds in respect of size are not adequately rendered. This\r\nremark applies especially to the dogs; for although the artist has\r\nendeavoured to draw them in perspective, unless the distance between\r\nthose in the foreground and those in the background is understood to be\r\nmore considerable than it appears, an inadequate idea is given of the\r\nrelative differences of size. The most instructive of the groups, I\r\nthink, is that of the Canaries; because the many and great changes in\r\ndifferent directions must in this case have been produced by artificial\r\nselection in so comparatively short a time--the first mention of this\r\nbird that I can find being by Gesner, in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, it is surely unquestionable that in these typical proofs of the\r\nefficacy of artificial selection in the modification of specific types,\r\nwe have the strongest conceivable testimony to the power of natural\r\nselection in the same direction. For it thus appears that wherever\r\nmankind has had occasion to operate by selection for a sufficiently long\r\ntime--that is to say, on whatever species of plant or animal he chooses\r\nthus to operate for the purpose of modifying the type in any required\r\ndirection,--the results are always more or less the same: he finds that\r\nall specific types lend themselves to continuous deflection in any\r\nparticulars of structure, colour, &c., that he may desire to modify.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to this parallel between the known effects of artificial\r\nselection, and the inferred effects of natural selection, two objections\r\nhave been urged. The first is, that in the case of artificial selection\r\nthe selecting agent is a voluntary intelligence, while in the case of\r\nnatural selection the selecting agent is Nature herself; and whether or\r\nnot there is any counterpart of man's voluntary intelligence in nature\r\nis a question with which Darwinism has nothing to do. Therefore, it is\r\nalleged, the analogy between natural selection and artificial selection\r\nfails _ab initio_, or at the fountain-head of the causes which are taken\r\nby the analogy to be respectively involved.\r\n\r\nThe second objection to the analogy is, that the products of artificial\r\nselection, closely as they may resemble natural species in all other\r\nrespects, nevertheless present one conspicuous and highly important\r\npoint of difference: they rarely, if ever, present the physiological\r\ncharacter of mutual infertility, which is a character of extremely\r\ngeneral occurrence in the case of natural species, even when these are\r\nmost nearly allied.\r\n\r\nI will deal with these two objections in the next chapter, where I shall\r\nbe concerned with the meeting of all the objections which have ever been\r\nurged against the theory of natural selection. Meanwhile I am engaged\r\nonly in presenting the general arguments which support the theory, and\r\ntherefore mention these objections to one of them merely _en passant_.\r\nAnd I do so in order to pledge myself effectually to dispose of them\r\nlater on, so that for the purposes of my present argument both these\r\nobjections may be provisionally regarded as non-existent; which means,\r\nin other words, that we may provisionally regard the analogy between\r\nartificial selection and natural selection as everywhere logically\r\nintact.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, the results of the foregoing exposition thus far, what\r\nI hold to be the three principal, or most general, arguments in favour\r\nof the theory of natural selection, are as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the _a priori_ consideration that, if on independent\r\ngrounds we believe in the theory of evolution at all, it becomes obvious\r\nthat natural selection _must_ have had _some_ part in the process. For\r\nno one can deny the potent facts of heredity, variability, the struggle\r\nfor existence, and survival of the fittest. But to admit these facts is\r\nto admit natural selection as a principle which must be, at any rate,\r\none of the factors of organic evolution, supposing such evolution to\r\nhave taken place. Next, when we turn from these _a priori_\r\nconsiderations, which thus show that natural selection _must_ have been\r\nconcerned to some extent in the process of evolution, we find in organic\r\nnature evidence _a posteriori_ of the extent to which this principle\r\n_has_ been thus concerned. For we find that among all the countless\r\nmillions of adaptive structures which are to be met with in organic\r\nnature, it is an invariable rule that they exist in relation to the\r\nneeds of the particular species which present them: they never have any\r\nprimary reference to the needs of other species. And as this\r\nextraordinarily large and general fact is exactly what the theory of\r\nnatural selection would expect, the theory is verified by the fact in an\r\nextraordinarily cogent manner. In other words, the fact goes to prove\r\nthat in _all_ cases where adaptive structures or instincts are\r\nconcerned, natural selection must have been either the sole cause at\r\nwork, or, at the least, an influence controlling the operation of all\r\nother causes.\r\n\r\nLastly, an actually experimental verification of the theory has been\r\nfurnished on a gigantic scale by the operations of breeders, fanciers,\r\nand horticulturists. For these men, by their process of selective\r\naccumulation, have empirically proved what immense changes of type may\r\nthus be brought about; and so have verified by anticipation, and in a\r\nmost striking manner, the theory of natural selection--which, as now so\r\nfully explained, is nothing more than a theory of cumulative\r\nmodifications by means of selective breeding.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, by way of generalities. But perhaps the proof of natural\r\nselection as an agency of the first importance in the transmutation of\r\nspecies may be best brought home to us by considering a few of its\r\napplications in detail. I will therefore devote the rest of the present\r\nchapter to considering a few cases of this kind.\r\n\r\nThere are so many large fields from which such special illustrations may\r\nbe supplied, that it is difficult to decide which of them to draw upon.\r\nFor instance, the innumerable, always interesting, and often astonishing\r\nadaptations on the part of flowers to the fertilising agency of insects,\r\nhas alone given rise to an extensive literature since the time when\r\nDarwin himself was led to investigate the subject by the guidance of his\r\nown theory. The same may be said of the structures and movements of\r\nclimbing plants, and in short, of all the other departments of natural\r\nhistory where the theory of natural selection has led to the study of\r\nthe phenomena of adaptation. For in all these cases the theory of\r\nnatural selection, which first led to their discovery, still remains the\r\nonly scientific theory by which they can be explained. But among all the\r\npossible fields from which evidences of this kind may be drawn, I think\r\nthe best is that which may be generically termed defensive colouring. To\r\nthis field, therefore, I will restrict myself. But, even so, the cases\r\nto be mentioned are but mere samples taken from different divisions of\r\nthis field; and therefore it must be understood at the outset that they\r\ncould easily be multiplied a hundred-fold.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Protective Colouring._\r\n\r\nA vast number of animals are rendered more or less inconspicuous by\r\nresembling the colours of the surfaces on which they habitually rest.\r\nSuch, for example, are grouse, partridges, rabbits, &c. Moreover, there\r\nare many cases in which, if the needs of the creature be such that it\r\nmust habitually frequent surfaces of different colours, it has acquired\r\nthe power of changing its colour accordingly--e. g. cuttle-fish,\r\nflat-fish, frogs, chameleons, &c. The physiological mechanism whereby\r\nthese adaptive changes of colour are produced differs in different\r\nanimals; but it is needless for our purposes to go into this part of the\r\nsubject. Again, there are yet other cases where protective colouring\r\nwhich is admirably suited to conceal an animal through one part of the\r\nyear, would become highly conspicuous during another part of it--namely,\r\nwhen the ground is covered with snow. Accordingly, in these cases the\r\nanimals change their colour in the winter months to a snowy white:\r\nwitness stoats, mountain hares, ptarmigan, &c. (Fig. 108.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 108.--Seasonal changes of colour in Ptarmigan\r\n    (_Lagopus mutus_). Drawn from stuffed specimens in the British\r\n    Museum, 1/6 nat. size, with appropriate surroundings supplied.]\r\n\r\nNow, it is sufficiently obvious that in all these classes of cases the\r\nconcealment from enemies or prey which is thus secured is of advantage\r\nto the animals concerned; and, therefore, that in the theory of natural\r\nselection we have a satisfactory theory whereby to explain it. And this\r\ncannot be said of any other theory of adaptive mechanisms in nature that\r\nhas ever been propounded. The so-called Lamarckian theory, for instance,\r\ncannot be brought to bear upon the facts at all; and on the theory of\r\nspecial creation it is unintelligible why the phenomena of protective\r\ncolouring should be of such general occurrence. For, in as far as\r\nprotective colouring is of advantage to the species which present it, it\r\nis of corresponding disadvantage to those other species against the\r\npredatory nature of which it acts as a defence. And, of course, the\r\nsame applies to yet other species, if they serve as prey. Moreover,\r\nthe more minutely this subject is investigated in all its details,\r\nthe more exactly is it found to harmonise with the naturalistic\r\ninterpretation[38].\r\n\r\n    [38] Were it not that some of Darwin's critics have overlooked the\r\n    very point wherein the great value of protective colouring as\r\n    evidence of natural selection consists, it would be needless to\r\n    observe that it does so in the _minuteness_ of the protective\r\n    resemblance which in so many cases is presented. Of course where the\r\n    resemblance is only very general, the phenomena might be ascribed to\r\n    mere coincidence, of which the instincts of the animal have taken\r\n    advantage. But in the measure that the resemblance becomes minutely\r\n    detailed, the supposition of mere coincidence is excluded, and the\r\n    agency of some specially adaptive cause demonstrated. Again, it is\r\n    almost needless to say, no real difficulty is presented (as has been\r\n    alleged) by the cases above quoted of seasonal imitations, on the\r\n    ground that natural selection could not act alternately on the same\r\n    individual. Natural selection is not supposed to act alternately on\r\n    the same individual. It is supposed to act always in the same\r\n    manner, and if, as in the case of a regularly recurring change in\r\n    the colours of the environment, correspondingly recurrent changes\r\n    are required to appear in the colours of the animals, natural\r\n    selection sets its premium upon those individuals the constitutions\r\n    of which best lend themselves to seasonal changes of the needful\r\n    kind--probably under the influence of stimuli supplied by the\r\n    changes of external conditions (temperature, moisture, &c.).\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we always find a complete correspondence between\r\nimitative colouring and instinctive endowment. If a caterpillar exactly\r\nresembles the colour of a twig, it also presents the instinct of\r\nhabitually reposing in the attitude which makes it most resemble a\r\ntwig--standing out from the branch on which it rests at the same angle\r\nas is presented by the real twigs of the tree on which it lives.\r\n\r\nHere, again, is a bird protectively coloured so as to resemble stones\r\nupon the rough ground where it habitually lives; and the drawing shows\r\nthe attitude in which the bird instinctively reposes, so as still\r\nfurther to increase its resemblance to a stone. (Fig. 109.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 109.--_Oedicnemus crepitans_, showing the\r\n    instinctive attitude of concealment. Drawn from a stuffed specimen\r\n    in the British Museum, 1/6 nat. size, with appropriate surroundings\r\n    supplied.\r\n\r\nTo take only one other instance, hares and rabbits, like grouse and\r\npartridges--or like the plover just alluded to,--instinctively crouch\r\nupon those surfaces the colours of which they resemble; and I have often\r\nremarked that if, on account of any individual peculiarity of\r\ncoloration, the animal is not able thus to secure concealment, it\r\nnevertheless exhibits the instinct of crouching which is of benefit to\r\nall its kind, although, from the accident of its own abnormal colouring,\r\nthis instinct is then actually detrimental to the animal itself. For\r\nexample, every sportsman must have noticed that the somewhat rare\r\nmelanic variety of the common rabbit will crouch as steadily as the\r\nnormal brownish-gray type, notwithstanding that, owing to its abnormal\r\ncolour, a \"nigger-rabbit\" thus renders itself the most conspicuous\r\nobject in the landscape. In all such cases, of course, there has been a\r\ndeviation from the normal type in respect of colour, with the result\r\nthat the inherited instinct is no longer in tune with the other\r\nendowments of the animal. Such a variation of colour, therefore, will\r\ntend to be suppressed by natural selection; while any variations which\r\nmay bring the animal still more closely to resemble its habitual\r\nsurroundings will be preserved. Thus we can understand the truly\r\nwonderful extent to which this principle of protective colouring has\r\nbeen carried in many cases where the need of it has been most urgent.\r\n\r\nNot only colour, but structure, may be profoundly modified for the\r\npurposes of protective concealment. Thus, caterpillars which resemble\r\ntwigs do so not only in respect of colour, but also of shape; and this\r\neven down to the most minute details in cases where the adaptation is\r\nmost complete: certain butterflies and leaf-insects so precisely\r\nresemble the leaves upon which, or among which, they live, that it is\r\nalmost impossible to detect them in the foliage--not only the colour,\r\nthe shape, and the venation being all exactly imitated, but in some\r\ncases even the defects to which the leaves are liable, in the way of\r\nfungoid growths, &c. There are other insects which with similar\r\nexactness resemble moss, lichens, and so forth. A species of fish\r\nsecures a complete resemblance to bunches of sea-weed by a frond-like\r\nmodification of all its appendages, and so on through many other\r\ninstances. Now, in all such cases where there is so precise an\r\nimitation, both in colour and structure, it seems impossible to suggest\r\nany other explanation of the facts than the one which is supplied by\r\nMr. Darwin's theory--namely, that the more perfect the resemblance is\r\ncaused to become through the continuous influence of natural selection\r\nalways picking out the best imitations, the more highly discriminative\r\nbecomes the perception of those enemies against the depredations of\r\nwhich this peculiar kind of protection is developed; so that, in virtue\r\nof this action and re-action, eventually we have a degree of imitation\r\nwhich renders it almost impossible for a naturalist to detect the animal\r\nwhen living in its natural environment.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 110.--Imitative forms and colours in insects.\r\n    Drawn from nature (_R. Coll. Surg. Mus._).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Warning Colours._\r\n\r\nIn strange and glaring contrast to all these cases of protective\r\ncolouring, stand other cases of conspicuous colouring. Thus, for\r\nexample, although there are numberless species of caterpillars which\r\npresent in an astonishing degree the phenomena of protective colouring,\r\nthere are numberless other species which not only fail to present these\r\nphenomena in any degree, but actually go to the opposite extreme of\r\npresenting colours which appear to have been developed for the sake of\r\ntheir conspicuousness. At all events, these caterpillars are usually the\r\nmost conspicuous objects in their surroundings, and therefore in the\r\nearly days of Darwinism they were regarded by Darwin himself as\r\npresenting a formidable difficulty in the way of his theory. To Mr.\r\nWallace belongs the merit of having cleared up this difficulty in an\r\nextraordinarily successful manner. He virtually reasoned thus. If the\r\n_raison d'etre_ of protective colouring be that of concealing agreeably\r\nflavoured caterpillars from the eye-sight of birds, may not the _raison\r\nd'etre_ of conspicuous colouring be that of protecting disagreeably\r\nflavoured caterpillars from any possibility of being mistaken by birds?\r\nShould this be the case, of course the more conspicuous the colouring\r\nthe better would it be for the caterpillars presenting it. Now as soon\r\nas this suggestion was acted upon experimentally, it was found to be\r\nborne out by facts. Birds could not be induced to eat caterpillars of\r\nthe kinds in question; and there is now no longer any doubt that their\r\nconspicuous colouring is correlated with their distastefulness to birds,\r\nin the same way as the inconspicuous or imitative colouring of other\r\ncaterpillars is correlated with their tastefulness to birds. Here then\r\nis yet another instance, added to those already given, of the\r\nverification yielded to the theory of natural selection by its proved\r\ncompetency as a guide to facts in nature; for assuredly this particular\r\nclass of facts would never have been suspected but for its suggestive\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of protective imitation, so in this case of warning\r\nconspicuousness, not only colour, but structure may be greatly modified\r\nfor the purpose of securing immunity from attack. Here, of course, the\r\nobject is to assume, as far as possible, a touch-me-not appearance; so\r\nthat, although destitute of any real means of offence, the creatures in\r\nquestion present a fictitiously dangerous aspect. As the\r\nDevil's-coach-horse turns up his stingless tail when threatened by an\r\nenemy, so in numberless ways do many harmless animals of all classes\r\npretend to be formidable. But the point now is that these instincts of\r\nself-defence are often helped out by structural modifications,\r\nexpressly and exclusively adapted to this end. For example, what a\r\nremarkable series of protective adjustments occurs in the life-history\r\nof the Puss Moth--culminating with so comical an instance of the\r\nparticular device now under consideration as the following. I quote the\r\nfacts from Mr. E. B. Poulton's admirable book on _The Colours of\r\nAnimals_ (pp. 269-271).\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 111.--The larva of Puss Moth (_C. vinula_)\r\n     when undisturbed; full-fed; natural size.]\r\n\r\n     The larva of the Puss Moth (Cerura vinula) is very common upon\r\n     poplar and willow. The circular dome-like eggs are laid, either\r\n     singly or in little groups of two or three, upon the upper side of\r\n     the leaf, and being of a reddish colour strongly suggest the\r\n     appearance of little galls, or the results of some other injury to\r\n     the leaf. The youngest larvae are black, and also rest upon the\r\n     upper surface of the leaf, resembling the dark patches which are\r\n     commonly seen in this position. As the larva grows, the apparent\r\n     black patch would cover too large a space, and would lead to\r\n     detection if it still occupied the whole surface of the body. The\r\n     latter gains a green ground-colour which harmonises with the leaf,\r\n     while the dark marking is chiefly confined to the back. As growth\r\n     proceeds the relative amount of green increases, and the dark mark\r\n     is thus prevented from attaining a size which would render it too\r\n     conspicuous. In the last stage of growth the green larva becomes\r\n     very large, and usually rests on the twigs of its food-plant (Fig.\r\n     111). The dark colour is still present on the back but is softened\r\n     to a purplish tint, which tends to be replaced by a combination of\r\n     white and green in many of the largest larvae. Such a larva is well\r\n     concealed by General Protective Resemblance, and one may search a\r\n     long time before finding it, although assured of its presence from\r\n     the stripped branches of the food-plant and the faeces on the ground\r\n     beneath.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 112.--The larva of Puss Moth in its terrifying\r\n     attitude after being disturbed; full-fed; natural size.]\r\n\r\n     As soon as a large larva is discovered and disturbed it withdraws\r\n     its head into the first body-ring, inflating the margin, which is\r\n     of a bright red colour. There are two intensely black spots on this\r\n     margin in the appropriate position for eyes, and the whole\r\n     appearance is that of a large flat face extending to the outer edge\r\n     of the red margin (see Fig. 112). The effect is an intensely\r\n     exaggerated caricature of a vertebrate face, which is probably\r\n     alarming to the vertebrate enemies of the caterpillar. The\r\n     terrifying effect is therefore mimetic. The movements entirely\r\n     depend on tactile impressions: when touched ever so lightly a\r\n     healthy larva immediately assumes the terrifying attitude, and\r\n     turns so as to present its full face towards the enemy; if touched\r\n     on the other side or on the back it instantly turns its face in the\r\n     appropriate direction. The effect is also greatly strengthened by\r\n     two pink whips which are swiftly protruded from the prongs of the\r\n     fork in which the body terminates. The prongs represent the last\r\n     pair of larval legs which have been greatly modified from their\r\n     ordinary shape and use. The end of the body is at the same time\r\n     curved forward over the back (generally much further than in Fig.\r\n     112), so that the pink filaments are brandished above the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry._\r\n\r\nLastly, these facts as to imitative and conspicuous colouring lead on to\r\nthe yet more remarkable facts of what is called mimicry. By mimicry is\r\nmeant the imitation in form and colour of one species by another, in\r\norder that the imitating species may be mistaken for the imitated, and\r\nthus participate in some advantage which the latter enjoys. For\r\ninstance, if, as in the case of the conspicuously-coloured caterpillars,\r\nit is of advantage to an ill-savoured species that it should hold out a\r\nwarning to enemies, clearly it may be of no less advantage to a\r\nwell-savoured species that it should borrow this flag, and thus be\r\nmistaken for its ill-savoured neighbour. Now, the extent to which this\r\ndevice of mimicry is carried is highly remarkable, not only in respect\r\nof the number of its cases, but also in respect of the astonishing\r\naccuracy which in most of these cases is exhibited by the imitation.\r\nThere need be little or virtually no zoological affinity between the\r\nimitating and the imitated forms; that is to say, in some cases the\r\nzoological affinity is not closer than ordinal, and therefore cannot\r\npossibly be ascribed to kinship. Like all the other branches of the\r\ngeneral subject of protective resemblance in form or colouring, this\r\nbranch has already been so largely illustrated by previous writers,\r\nthat, as in the previous cases, I need only give one or two examples.\r\nThose which I choose are chosen on account of the colours concerned not\r\nbeing highly varied or brilliant, and therefore lending themselves to\r\nless ineffectual treatment by wood-engraving than is the case where\r\nattempts are made to render by this means even more remarkable\r\ninstances. (Figs. 113, 114, 115.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 113.--Three cases of mimicry. Drawn from nature:\r\n    first two pairs nat. size, last pair 2/3 (_R. Coll. Surg. Mus._).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 114.--Two further cases of mimicry; flies\r\n    resembling a wasp in the one and a bee in the other. Drawn from\r\n    nature: nat. size (_R. Coll. Surg. Mus._).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 115.--A case of mimicry where a non-venomous\r\n    species of snake resembles a venomous one. Drawn from nature: 1/3\r\n    nat. size (_R. Coll. Surg. Mus._).]\r\n\r\nIt is surely apparent, without further comment, that it is impossible to\r\nimagine stronger evidence in favour of natural selection as a true cause\r\nin nature, than is furnished by this culminating fact in the matter of\r\nprotective resemblance, whereby it is shown that a species of one\r\ngenus, family, or even order, will accurately mimic the appearance of a\r\nspecies belonging to another genus, family, or order, so as to deceive\r\nits natural enemies into mistaking it for a creature of so totally\r\ndifferent a kind. And it must be added that while this fact of mimicry\r\nis of extraordinarily frequent occurrence, there can be no possibility\r\nof our mistaking its purpose. For the fact is never observable except in\r\nthe case of species which occupy the same area or district.\r\n\r\nSuch being what appears to me the only reasonable view of the matter, I\r\nwill now conclude this chapter on the evidences of natural selection as\r\nat all events the main factor of organic evolution, by simply adding\r\nillustrations of two further cases of mimicry, which are perhaps even\r\nmore remarkable than any of the foregoing examples. The first of the two\r\n(Fig. 115) speaks for itself. The second will be rendered intelligible\r\nby the following few words of explanation.\r\n\r\nThere are certain ants of the Amazons which present the curious instinct\r\nof cutting off leaves from trees, and carrying them like banners over\r\ntheir heads to the hive, as represented in Fig. 116, B, where one ant is\r\nshown without a leaf, and the others each with a leaf. Their object in\r\nthus collecting leaves is probably that of growing a fungus upon the\r\n\"soil\" which is furnished by the leaves when decomposing. But, be this\r\nas it may[39], the only point we are now concerned with is the\r\nappearance which these ants present when engaged in their habitual\r\noperation of carrying leaves. For it has been recently observed by Mr.\r\nW. L. Sclater, that in the localities where these hymenopterous insects\r\noccur, there occurs also a _homopterous_ insect which mimics the ant,\r\nleaf and all, in a wonderfully deceptive manner. The leaf is imitated by\r\nthe thin flattened body of the insect, \"which in its dorsal aspect is so\r\ncompressed laterally that it is no thicker than a leaf, and terminates\r\nin a sharp jagged edge.\" The colour is exactly the same as that of a\r\nleaf, and the brown legs show themselves beneath the green body in just\r\nthe same way as those of the ant show themselves beneath the leaf. So\r\nthat both the form and the colouring of the homopterous insect has been\r\nbrought to resemble, with singular exactness, those belonging to a\r\ndifferent order of insect, when the latter is engaged in its peculiar\r\navocation. A glance at the figure is enough to show the means employed\r\nand the result attained. In A, an ant and its mimic are represented as\r\nabout 2-1/2 times their natural size, and both proceeding in the same\r\ndirection. It ought to be mentioned, however, that in reality the margin\r\nof the leaf is seldom allowed to retain its natural serrations as here\r\ndepicted: the ants usually gnaw the edge of the real leaf, so that the\r\nmargin of the false one bears an even closer resemblance to it than the\r\nillustration represents. B is a drawing from life of a group of five\r\nants carrying leaves, and their mimic walking beside them[40].\r\n\r\n    [39] For a full account of this instinct and its probable purpose,\r\n    see _Animal Intelligence_, pp. 93-6.\r\n\r\n    [40] Both drawings are reproduced from Mr. Poulton's paper upon the\r\n    subject (_Proc. Zool. Soc._, June 16, 1891).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 116 PROTECTIVE MIMICRY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCRITICISMS OF THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to consider the various objections and difficulties\r\nwhich have hitherto been advanced against the theory of natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nVery early in the day Owen hurled the weight of his authority against\r\nthe new theory, and this with a strength of onslaught which was only\r\nequalled by its want of judgment. Indeed, it is painfully apparent that\r\nhe failed to apprehend the fundamental principles of the Darwinian\r\ntheory. For he says:--\r\n\r\n     Natural Selection is an explanation of the process [of\r\n     transmutation] of the same kind and value as that which has been\r\n     proffered of the mystery of \"secretion.\" For example, a particular\r\n     mass of matter in a living animal takes certain elements out of the\r\n     blood, and rejects them as \"bile.\" Attributes were given to the\r\n     liver which can only be predicated of the whole animal; the\r\n     \"appetency\" of the liver, it was said, was for the elements of\r\n     bile, and \"biliosity,\" or the \"hepatic sensation,\" guided the gland\r\n     to their secretion. Such figurative language, I need not say,\r\n     explains absolutely nothing of the nature of bilification[41].\r\n\r\n    [41] _Anatomy of Vertebrates_, vol. iii. p. 794.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, it was needless for Owen to say that figurative language of\r\nthis kind explains nothing; but it was little less than puerile in him\r\nto see no more in the theory of natural selection than such a mere\r\nfigure of speech. To say that the liver selects the elements of bile, or\r\nthat nature selects specific types, may both be equally unmeaning\r\nre-statements of facts; but when it is explained that the term natural\r\nselection, unlike that of \"hepatic sensation,\" is used as a shorthand\r\nexpression for a whole group of well-known natural causes--struggle,\r\nvariation, survival, heredity,--then it becomes evidence of an almost\r\nchildish want of thought to affirm that the expression is figurative and\r\nnothing more. The doctrine of natural selection may be a huge mistake;\r\nbut, if so, this is not because it consists of any unmeaning metaphor:\r\nit can only be because the combination of natural causes which it\r\nsuggests is not of the same adequacy in fact as it is taken to be in\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nOwen further objected that the struggle for existence could only act as\r\na cause of the extinction of species, not of their origination--a view\r\nof the case which again shows on his part a complete failure to grasp\r\nthe conception of Darwinism. Acting alone, the struggle for existence\r\ncould only cause extermination; but acting together with variation,\r\nsurvival, and heredity, it may very well--for anything that Owen, or\r\nothers who followed in this line of criticism, show to the\r\ncontrary--have produced every species of plant and animal that has ever\r\nappeared upon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnother and closely allied objection is, that the theory of natural\r\nselection \"personifies an abstraction.\" Or, as the Duke of Argyll states\r\nit, the theory is \"essentially the image of mechanical necessity\r\nconcealed under the clothes, and parading in the mask, of mental\r\npurpose. The word 'natural' suggests Matter, and the physical forces.\r\nThe word 'selection' suggests Mind, and the powers of choice.\" This,\r\nhowever, is a mere quarrelling about words. Darwin called the principle\r\nwhich he had discovered by the name natural selection in order to mark\r\nthe analogy between it and artificial selection. No doubt in this\r\nanalogy there is not necessarily supposed to be in nature any\r\ncounterpart to the mind of the breeder, nor, therefore, to his powers of\r\nintelligent choice. But there is no need to limit the term _selection_\r\n(_se_ and _lego_, Gr. [Greek: lego]) to powers of intelligent choice. As\r\npreviously remarked, a bank of sea-weed on the sea-shore may be said to\r\nhave been selected by the waves from all the surrounding sand and\r\nstones. Similarly, we may say that grain is selected from chaff by the\r\nwind in the process of winnowing corn. Or, if it be thought that there\r\nis any ambiguity involved in such a use of the term in the case of\r\n\"Natural Selection,\" there is no objection to employing the phrase which\r\nhas been coined by Mr. Spencer as its equivalent--namely, \"Survival of\r\nthe Fittest.\" The point of the theory is, that those organisms which are\r\nbest suited to their surroundings are allowed to live and to propagate,\r\nwhile those which are less suited are eliminated; and whether we call\r\nthis process a process of selection, or call it by any other name, is\r\nclearly immaterial.\r\n\r\nA material question is raised only when it is asked whether the process\r\nis one that can be ascribed to causation strictly natural. It is often\r\ndenied that such is the case, on the ground that natural selection does\r\nnot originate the variations which it favours, but depends upon the\r\nvariations being supplied by some other means. For, it is said, all that\r\nnatural selection does is to preserve the suitable variations _after\r\nthey have arisen_. Natural selection does not _cause_ these suitable\r\nvariations; and therefore, it is argued, Darwin and his followers are\r\nprofoundly mistaken in representing the principle as one which\r\n_produces_ adaptations. Now, although this objection has been put\r\nforward by some of the most intelligent minds in our generation, it\r\nappears to me to betoken some extraordinary failure to appreciate the\r\nvery essence of Darwinian doctrine. No doubt it is perfectly true that\r\nnatural selection does not produce variations of any kind, whether\r\nbeneficial or otherwise. But if it be granted that variations of many\r\nkinds are occurring in every generation, and that natural selection is\r\ncompetent to preserve the more favourable among them, then it appears to\r\nme unquestionable that this principle of selection deserves to be\r\nregarded as, in the full sense of the word, a natural cause. The\r\nvariations being expressly regarded by the theory as more or less\r\npromiscuous[42], survival of the fittest becomes the winnowing fan,\r\nwhose function it is to eliminate all the less fit in each generation,\r\nin order to preserve the good grain, out of which to constitute the next\r\ngeneration. And as this process is supposed to be continuous through\r\nsuccessive generations, its action is supposed to be cumulative, till\r\nfrom the eye of a worm there is gradually developed the eye of an eagle.\r\nTherefore it follows from these suppositions (which are not disputed by\r\nthe present objection), that if it had not been for the process of\r\nselection, such development would never have been begun; and that in the\r\nexact measure of its efficiency will the development proceed. But any\r\nagency without the operation of which a result cannot take place may\r\nproperly be designated the cause of that result: it is the agency which,\r\nin co-operation with all the other agencies in the cosmos, produces that\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n    [42] The degree in which variability is indefinite, or, on the\r\n    contrary, determinate, is a question which is not yet ripe for\r\n    decision--nor even, in my opinion, for discussion. But I may here\r\n    state the following general principles with regard to it.\r\n\r\n    (1) It is evident that up to some point or another variations _must_\r\n    be pre-determined in definite lines. Men do not gather grapes from\r\n    thorns, figs from thistles, nor even moss-roses from sweet-briars.\r\n    In other words, \"the nature of the organism\" in all cases\r\n    necessitates the limiting of variations within certain bounds.\r\n\r\n    (2) But when the question is as to what these bounds may be, we can\r\n    only answer in a general way that, according to the general theory\r\n    of evolution, they must be such as are imposed by heredity, coupled\r\n    with the degree to which external conditions of life (and possibly\r\n    also use-inheritance) are capable, in given cases, of modifying\r\n    congenital characters. These are the only causes which the theory of\r\n    descent can consistently recognise as producing variations in\r\n    determinate directions.\r\n\r\n    (3) Inasmuch as variation presupposes the existence of parts that\r\n    vary, and inasmuch as the variation of parts can only be in the\r\n    alternative directions of increase or decrease around an average, it\r\n    follows that, in the first instance at all events, every variation,\r\n    if determinate, must be so only in one or other of these two\r\n    opposite directions.\r\n\r\n    (4) In as far as variations are summated in successive generations,\r\n    so as eventually to give rise to new structures, organs, mechanisms,\r\n    &c., natural selection is theoretically competent to explain the\r\n    facts, without our having to postulate the operation of unknown\r\n    causes producing variations in determinate lines,--or not further\r\n    than is stated in paragraphs 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n    (5) Nevertheless, it does not follow that there are not such other\r\n    unknown causes; and, if there are, of course the importance of\r\n    natural selection as a cause of adaptive modification would be\r\n    limited in proportion to their number and the extent of their\r\n    operation. But it is for those who, like the late Professors Asa\r\n    Gray and Naegeli, maintain the existence of such causes, to\r\n    substantiate their belief by indicating them.\r\n\r\nTake any analogous case. The selective agency of specific gravity which\r\nis utilised in gold-washing does not create the original differences\r\nbetween gold-dust and dust of all other kinds. But these differences\r\nbeing presented by as many different bodies in nature, the gold-washer\r\ntakes advantage of the selective agency in question, and, by using it as\r\na cause of segregation, is enabled to separate the gold from all the\r\nearths with which it may happen to be mixed. So far as the objects of\r\nthe gold-washer are concerned, it is immaterial with what other earths\r\nthe gold-dust may happen to be mixed. For although gold-dust may occur\r\nin intimate association with earths of various kinds in various\r\nproportions, and although in each case the particular admixture which\r\noccurs must have been due to definite causes, these things, in relation\r\nto the selective process of the washer, are what is called accidental:\r\nthat is to say, they have nothing to do with the causative action of the\r\nselective process. Now, in precisely the same sense Darwin calls the\r\nmultitudinous variations of plants and animals accidental. By so calling\r\nthem he expressly says he does not suppose them to be accidental in the\r\nsense of not all being due to definite causes. But they are accidental\r\nin relation to the sifting process of natural selection: all that they\r\nhave to do is to furnish the promiscuous material on which this sifting\r\nprocess acts.\r\n\r\nOr let us take an even closer analogy. The power of selective breeding\r\nby man is so wonderful, that in the course of successive generations all\r\nkinds of peculiarities as to size, shape, colour, special appendages or\r\nabortions, &c., can be produced at pleasure, as we saw in the last\r\nchapter. Now all the promiscuous variations which are supplied to the\r\nbreeder, and out of which, by selecting only those that are suited to\r\nhis purpose, he is able to produce the required result--all those\r\npromiscuous variations, in relation to that purpose, are accidental.\r\nTherefore the selective agency of the breeder deserves to be regarded as\r\nthe cause of that which it produces, or of that which could not have\r\nbeen produced but for the operation of such agency. But where is the\r\ndifference between artificial and natural selection in this respect?\r\nAnd, if there is no difference, is not natural selection as much\r\nentitled to be regarded as a true cause of the origin of natural\r\nspecies, as artificial selection is to be regarded as a true cause of\r\nour domesticated races? Here, as in the case of the previous\r\nillustration, if there be any ambiguity in speaking of variations as\r\naccidental, it arises from the incorrect or undefined manner in which\r\nthe term \"accidental\" is used by Darwin's critics. In its original and\r\nphilosophically-correct usage, the term \"accident\" signifies a property\r\nor quality not essential to our conception of a substance: hence, it has\r\ncome to mean anything that happens as a result of unforeseen causes--or,\r\nlastly, that which is causeless. But, as we know that nothing can happen\r\nwithout causes of some kind, the term \"accident\" is divested of real\r\nmeaning when it is used in the last of these senses. Yet this is the\r\nsense that is sought to be placed upon it by the objection which we are\r\nconsidering. If the objectors will but understand the term in its\r\ncorrect philosophical sense--or in the only sense in which it presents\r\nany meaning at all,--they will see that Darwinians are both logically\r\nand historically justified in employing the word \"accidental\" as the\r\nword which serves most properly to convey the meaning that they\r\nintend--namely, variations due to causes accidental to the struggle for\r\nexistence. Similarly, when it is said that variations are \"spontaneous,\"\r\nor even \"fortuitous,\" nothing further is meant than that we do not know\r\nthe causes which lead to them, and that, so far as the principle of\r\nselection is concerned, it is immaterial what these causes may be. Or,\r\nto revert to our former illustration, the various weights of different\r\nkinds of earths are no doubt all due to definite causes; but, in\r\nrelation to the selective action of the gold-washer, all the different\r\nweights of whatever kinds of earth he may happen to include in his\r\nwashing-apparatus are, _strictly speaking_, accidental. And as at\r\ndifferent washings he meets with different proportions of heavy earths\r\nwith light ones, and as these \"variations\" are immaterial to him, he may\r\ncolloquially speak of them as \"fortuitous,\" or due to \"chance,\" even\r\nthough he knows that at each washing they must have been determined by\r\ndefinite causes.\r\n\r\nMore adequately to deal with this merely formal objection, however,\r\nwould involve more logic-chopping than is desirable on the present\r\noccasion. But I have already dealt with it fully elsewhere,--viz. in\r\n_The Contemporary Review_ for June, 1888, to which therefore I may refer\r\nany one who is interested in dialectics of this kind[43].\r\n\r\n    [43] Within the last few months this objection has been presented\r\n    anew by Mr. D. Syme, whose book _On the Modification of Organisms_\r\n    exhibits a curious combination of shrewd criticisms with almost\r\n    ludicrous misunderstandings. One of the latter it is necessary to\r\n    state, because it pervades the quotation which I am about to supply.\r\n    He everywhere compares \"natural selection\" with \"the struggle for\r\n    existence,\" uses them as convertible terms, and while absurdly\r\n    stating that \"Darwin defines natural selection as the struggle for\r\n    existence,\" complains of \"the liability of error, both on his own\r\n    part and on the part of his readers,\" which arises from his not\r\n    having everywhere adhered to this definition! (p. 8).\r\n\r\n    \"Darwin has put forth two distinct and contradictory theories of the\r\n    functions of natural selection. According to the one theory natural\r\n    selection is selective or preservative, and nothing more. According\r\n    to the other theory natural selection creates the variations(!) ...\r\n    It certainly seems absurd to speak of natural selection, or the\r\n    struggle for existence, as selective or preservative, for the\r\n    struggle for existence does not preserve at all, not even the fit\r\n    variations, as both the fit and the unfit struggle for existence,\r\n    the unfit naturally more than the fit, and the fit are preserved,\r\n    not in consequence of the struggle, but in consequence of their\r\n    fitness. Suppose two varieties of the same species are driven, by an\r\n    increase of their numbers, to seek for subsistence in a colder\r\n    region than they have been accustomed to, and that one of these\r\n    varieties had a hardier constitution than the other; and let us\r\n    suppose that the former withstood the severe climate better than the\r\n    latter, and consequently survived, while the other perished. In this\r\n    case the hardier survived, not because of the struggle, but because\r\n    it had a constitution better adapted to the climate. I wish to\r\n    ascertain if a certain metal in my possession is gold or some baser\r\n    metal, and I apply the usual test; but the mere fact of my testing\r\n    this metal would not make it gold or any other kind of metal.\"\r\n\r\n    I have thought it worth while to quote this passage for the sake of\r\n    showing the extraordinary confusion of mind which still prevails on\r\n    the part of Darwin's critics, even with reference to the very\r\n    fundamental parts of his theory. For, as I have said, the writer of\r\n    this passage shows himself a shrewd critic in some other parts of\r\n    his essay, where he is not engaged especially on the theory of\r\n    natural selection.\r\n\r\nI will now pass on to consider another misconception of the Darwinian\r\ntheory, which is very prevalent in the public mind. It is virtually\r\nasked, If some species are supposed to have been improved by natural\r\nselection, why have not all species been similarly improved? Why should\r\nnot all invertebrated animals have risen into vertebrated? Or why\r\nshould not all monkeys have become men?\r\n\r\nThe answers are manifold. In the first place, it by no means follows\r\nthat because an advance in organization has proved itself of benefit in\r\nthe case of one form of life, therefore any or every other form would\r\nhave been similarly benefited by a similar advance. The business of\r\nnatural selection is to bring this and that form of life into the\r\nclosest harmony with its environment that all the conditions of the case\r\npermit. Sometimes it will happen that the harmony will admit of being\r\nimproved by an improvement of organization. But just as often it will\r\nhappen that it will be best secured by leaving matters as they are. If,\r\ntherefore, an organism has already been brought into a tolerably full\r\ndegree of harmony with its environment, natural selection will not try\r\nto change it so long as the environment remains unchanged; and this, no\r\ndoubt, is the reason why some species have survived through enormous\r\nperiods of geological time without having undergone any change. Again,\r\nas we saw in a previous chapter, there are yet other cases where, on\r\naccount of some change in the environment or even in the habits of the\r\norganisms themselves, adaption will be best secured by an active\r\n_reversal_ of natural selection, with the result of causing\r\n_degeneration_.\r\n\r\nBut, it is sometimes further urged, there are cases where we cannot\r\ndoubt that improvement of organization would have been of benefit to\r\nspecies; and yet such improvement has not taken place--as, for instance,\r\nin the case all monkeys not turning into men. Here, however, we must\r\nremember that the operation of natural selection in any case depends\r\nupon a variety of highly complex conditions; and, therefore, that the\r\nfact of all those conditions having been satisfied in one instance is no\r\nreason for concluding that they must also have been satisfied in other\r\ninstances. Take, for example, the case of monkeys passing into men. The\r\nwonder to me appears to be that this improvement should have taken place\r\nin even one line of descent; not that, having taken place in one line,\r\nit should not also have taken place in other lines. For how enormously\r\ncomplex must have been the conditions--physical, anatomical,\r\nphysiological, psychological, sociological--which by their happy\r\nconjunction first began to raise the inarticulate cries of an ape into\r\nthe rational speech of a man. Therefore, the more that we appreciate the\r\nsuperiority of a man to an ape, the less ought we to countenance this\r\nsupposed objection to Darwin's theory--namely, that natural selection\r\nhas not effected the change in more than one line of descent.\r\n\r\nEven in the case of two races of mankind where one has risen higher in\r\nthe scale of civilization than another, it is now generally impossible\r\nto assign the particular causes of the difference; much more, then, must\r\nthis be impossible in the case of still more remote conditions which\r\nhave led to the divergence of species. The requisite variations may not\r\nhave arisen in the one line of descent which did arise in the other; or\r\nif they did arise in both, some counterbalancing disadvantages may have\r\nattended their initial development in the one case which did not obtain\r\nin the other. In short, where so exceedingly complex a play of\r\nconditions are concerned, the only wonder would be if two different\r\nlines of descent _had_ happened to present two independent and yet\r\nperfectly parallel lines of history.\r\n\r\nThese general considerations would apply equally to the great majority\r\nof other cases where some types have made great advances upon others,\r\nnotwithstanding that we can see no reason why the latter should not in\r\nthis respect have imitated the former. But there is yet a further\r\nconsideration which must be taken into account. The struggle for\r\nexistence is always most keen between closely allied species, because,\r\nfrom the similarity of their forms, habits, needs, &c., they are in\r\nclosest competition. Therefore it often happens that the mere fact of\r\none species having made an advance upon others of itself precludes the\r\nothers from making any similar advance: the field, so to speak, has\r\nalready been occupied as regards that particular improvement, and where\r\nthe struggle for existence is concerned possession is emphatically nine\r\npoints of the law. For example, to return to the case of apes becoming\r\nmen, the fact of one rational species having been already evolved (even\r\nif the rational faculty were at first but dimly nascent) must make an\r\nenormous change in the conditions as regards the possibility of any\r\nother such species being subsequently evolved--unless, of course, it be\r\nby way of descent from the rational one. Or, as Sir Charles Lyell has\r\nwell put it, two rational species can never _coexist_ on the globe,\r\nalthough the descendants of one rational species may in time become\r\n_transformed_ into another single rational species[44].\r\n\r\n    [44] _Principles of Geology_, vol. ii. p. 487 (11th ed.).\r\n\r\nIn view of such considerations, another and exactly opposite objection\r\nhas sometimes been urged--viz. that we ought never to find inferior\r\nforms of organization in company with superior, because in the struggle\r\nfor existence the latter ought to have exterminated the former. Or, to\r\nquote the most recent expression of this view, \"in every locality there\r\nwould only be one species, and that the most highly organized; and thus\r\na few superior races would partition the earth amongst them to the\r\nentire exclusion of the innumerable varieties, species, genera, and\r\norders which now inhabit it[45].\" Of course to this statement it would\r\nbe sufficient to enquire, On what would these few supremely organized\r\nspecies subsist? Unless manna fell from heaven for their especial\r\nbenefit, it would appear that such forms could under no circumstances be\r\nthe most improved forms; in exterminating others on such a scale as\r\nthis, they would themselves be quickly, and very literally, improved off\r\nthe face of the earth. But even when the statement is not made in so\r\nextravagant a form as this, it must necessarily be futile as an\r\nobjection unless it has first been shown that we know exactly all the\r\nconditions of the complex struggle for existence between the higher and\r\nlower forms in question. And this it is impossible that we ever can\r\nknow. The mere fact that one form has been changed in virtue of this\r\nstruggle must in many cases of itself determine a change in the\r\nconditions of the struggle. Again, the other and closely allied forms\r\n(and these furnish the best grounds for the objection) may also have\r\nundergone defensive changes, although these may be less conspicuous to\r\nour observation, or perhaps less suggestive of \"improvement\" to our\r\nimperfect means of judging. Lastly, not to continue citing an endless\r\nnumber of such considerations, there is the broad fact that it is only\r\nto those cases where, for some reason or another, the lower forms have\r\nnot been exposed to a struggle of fatal intensity, that the objection\r\napplies. But we know that in millions of other cases the lower (i. e.\r\nless fitted) forms _have_ succumbed, and therefore I do not see that the\r\nobjection has any ground to stand upon. That there is a general tendency\r\nfor lower forms to yield their places to higher is shown by the gradual\r\nadvance of organization throughout geological time; for if _all_ the\r\ninferior forms had survived, the earth could not have contained them,\r\nunless she had been continually growing into something like the size of\r\nJupiter. And if it be asked why any of the inferior forms have survived,\r\nthe answer has already been given, as above.\r\n\r\n    [45] Syme, on the _Modification of Organisms_, p. 46.\r\n\r\nThere is only one other remark to be made in this connexion. Mr. Syme\r\nchooses two cases as illustrations of the supposed difficulty. These are\r\nsufficiently diverse--viz. Foraminifera and Man. Touching the former,\r\nthere is nothing that need be added to the general answer just given.\r\nBut with regard to the latter it must be observed that the dominion of\r\nnatural selection as between different races of mankind is greatly\r\nrestricted by the presence of rationality. Competition in the human\r\nspecies is more concerned with wits and ideas than with nails and teeth;\r\nand therefore the \"struggle\" between man and man is not so much for\r\nactual _being_, as for _well-being_. Consequently, in regard to the\r\npresent objection, the human species furnishes the worst example that\r\ncould have been chosen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHitherto I have been considering objections which arise from\r\nmisapprehensions of Darwin's theory. I will now go on to consider a\r\nlogically sound objection, which nevertheless is equally futile,\r\nbecause, although it does not depend on any misapprehension of the\r\ntheory, it is not itself supported by fact.\r\n\r\nThe objection is the same as that which we have already considered in\r\nrelation to the general theory of descent--namely, that similar organs\r\nor structures are to be met with in widely different branches of the\r\ntree of life. Now this would be an objection fatal to the theory of\r\nnatural selection, supposing these organs or structures in the cases\r\ncompared are not merely analogous, but also homologous. For it would be\r\nincredible that in two totally different lines of descent one and the\r\nsame structure should have been built up independently by two parallel\r\nseries of variations, and that in these two lines of descent it should\r\nalways and independently have ministered to the same function. On the\r\nother hand, there would be nothing against the theory of natural\r\nselection in the fact that two structures, _not_ homologous, should come\r\nby independent variation in two different lines of descent to be adapted\r\nto perform the same function. For it belongs to the very essence of the\r\ntheory of natural selection that a useful function should be secured by\r\nfavourable variations of whatever structural material may happen to be\r\npresented by different organic types. Flying, for instance, is a very\r\nuseful function, and it has been developed independently in at least\r\nfour different lines of descent--namely, the insects, reptiles, birds,\r\nand mammals. Now if in all, or indeed in any, of these four cases the\r\nwings had been developed on the same anatomical pattern, so as not only\r\nto present the analogical resemblance which it is necessary that they\r\nshould present in order to discharge their common function of flying,\r\nbut likewise an homologous or structural resemblance, showing that they\r\nhad been formed on the same anatomical \"plan,\"--if such has been the\r\ncase, I say, the theory of natural selection would certainly be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nNow it has been alleged by competent naturalists that there are several\r\nsuch cases in organic nature. We have already noticed in a previous\r\nchapter (pp. 58, 59), that Mr. Mivart has instanced the eye of the\r\ncuttle-fish as not only analogous to, but also homologous with, the eye\r\nof a true fish--that is to say, the eye of a mollusk with the eye of a\r\nvertebrate. And he has also instanced the remarkable resemblance of a\r\nshrew to a mouse--that is, of an insectivorous mammal to a rodent--not\r\nto mention other cases. In the chapter alluded to these instances of\r\nhomology, alleged to occur in different branches of the tree of life,\r\nwere considered with reference to the process of organic evolution as a\r\nfact: they are now being considered with reference to the agency of\r\nnatural selection as a method. And just as in the former case it was\r\nshown, that if any such alleged instances could be proved, the proof\r\nwould be fatal to the general theory of organic evolution by physical\r\ncauses, so in the present case, if this could be proved, it would be\r\nequally fatal to the more special theory of natural selection. But, as\r\nwe have before seen, no single case of this kind has ever been made\r\nout; and, therefore, not only does this supposed objection fall to the\r\nground, but in so doing it furnishes an additional argument in favour of\r\nnatural selection. For in the earlier chapter just alluded to I showed\r\nthat this great and general fact of our nowhere being able to find two\r\nhomologous structures in different branches of the tree of life, was the\r\nstrongest possible testimony in favour of the theory of evolution. And,\r\nby parity of reasoning, I now adduce it as equally strong evidence of\r\nnatural selection having been the cause of _adaptive_ structures,\r\nindependently developed in all the different lines of descent. For the\r\nalternative is between adaptations having been caused by natural\r\nselection or by supernatural design. Now, if adaptations were caused by\r\nnatural selection, we can very well understand why they should never be\r\nhomologous in different lines of descent, even in cases where they have\r\nbeen brought to be so closely analogous as to have deceived so good a\r\nnaturalist as Mr. Mivart. Indeed, as I have already observed, so well\r\ncan we understand this, that any single instance to the contrary would\r\nbe sufficient to destroy the theory of natural selection _in toto_,\r\nunless the structure be one of a very simple type. But on the other\r\nhand, it is impossible to suggest any rational explanation why, if all\r\nadaptations are due to supernatural design, such scrupulous care should\r\nhave been taken never to allow homologous adaptations to occur in\r\ndifferent divisions of the animal or vegetable kingdoms. Why, for\r\ninstance, should the eye of a cuttle-fish _not_ have been constructed on\r\nthe same ideal pattern as that of vertebrate? Or why, among the\r\nthousands of vertebrated species, should no one of their eyes be\r\nconstructed on the ideal pattern that was devised for the cuttle-fish?\r\nOf course it may be answered that perhaps there was some hidden reason\r\nwhy the design should never have allowed an adaptation which it had\r\ndevised for one division of organic nature to appear in another--even in\r\ncases where the new design necessitated the closest possible resemblance\r\nin everything else, save in the matter of anatomical homology.\r\nUndoubtedly such may have been the case--or rather such _must_ have been\r\nthe case--if the theory of special design is true. But where the\r\nquestion is as to the truth of this theory, I think there can be no\r\ndoubt that its rival gains an enormous advantage by being able to\r\n_explain_ why the facts are such as they are instead of being obliged to\r\ntake refuge in hypothetical possibilities of a confessedly\r\nunsubstantiated and apparently unsubstantial kind.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as far as this objection to the theory of natural selection\r\nis concerned--or the allegation that homologous structures occur in\r\ndifferent divisions of organic nature--not only does it fall to the\r\nground, but positively becomes itself converted into one of the\r\nstrongest arguments in favour of the theory. As soon as the allegation\r\nis found to be baseless, the very fact that it cannot be brought to bear\r\nupon any one of all the millions of adaptive structures in organic\r\nnature becomes a fact of vast significance on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next difficulty to which I shall allude is that of explaining by the\r\ntheory of natural selection the preservation of the first beginnings of\r\nstructures which are then useless, though afterwards, when more fully\r\ndeveloped, they become useful. For it belongs to the very essence of the\r\ntheory of natural selection, that a structure must be supposed already\r\nuseful before it can come under the influence of natural selection:\r\ntherefore the theory seems incapable of explaining the origin and\r\nconservation of _incipient_ organs, or organs which are not yet\r\nsufficiently developed to be of any service to the organisms presenting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis objection is one that has been advanced by all the critics of\r\nDarwinism; but has been presented with most ability and force by the\r\nDuke of Argyll. I will therefore state it in his words.\r\n\r\n     If the doctrine of evolution be true--that is to say, if all\r\n     organic creatures have been developed by ordinary generation from\r\n     parents--then it follows of necessity that the primaeval germs must\r\n     have contained potentially the whole succeeding series. Moreover,\r\n     if that series has been developed gradually and very slowly, it\r\n     follows, also as a matter of necessity, that every modification of\r\n     structure must have been functionless at first, when it began to\r\n     appear.... Things cannot be selected until they have first been\r\n     produced. Nor can any structure be selected by utility in the\r\n     struggle for existence until it has not only been produced, but has\r\n     been so far perfected as to actually be used.\r\n\r\nThe Duke proceeds to argue that all adaptive structures must therefore\r\noriginally have been due to special design: in the earlier stages of\r\ntheir development they must all have been what he calls \"prophetic\r\ngerms.\" Not yet themselves of any use, and therefore not yet capable of\r\nbeing improved by natural selection, both in their origin and in the\r\nfirst stages (at all events) of their development, they must be\r\nregarded as intentionally preparatory to the various uses which they\r\nsubsequently acquire.\r\n\r\nNow this argument, forcible as it appears at first sight, is really at\r\nfault both in its premiss and in its conclusion. By which I mean that,\r\nin the first place the premiss is not true, and, in the next place, that\r\neven if it were, the conclusion would not necessarily follow. The\r\npremiss is, \"that every modification of structure must have been\r\nfunctionless at first, when it began to appear;\" and the conclusion is,\r\nthat, _qua_ functionless, such a modification cannot have been caused by\r\nnatural selection. I will consider these two points separately.\r\n\r\nFirst as to the premiss, it is not true that every modification of\r\nstructure must necessarily be functionless when it first begins to\r\nappear. There are two very good reasons why such should not be the case\r\nin all instances, even if it should be the case in some. For, as a\r\nmatter of observable fact, a very large proportional number of incipient\r\norgans are useful from the very moment of their inception. Take, for\r\nexample, what is perhaps the most wonderful instance of refined\r\nmechanism in nature--the eye of a vertebrated animal. Comparative\r\nanatomy and embryology combine to testify that this organ had its origin\r\nin modifications of the endings of the ordinary nerves of the skin. Now\r\nit is evident that from the very first any modification of a cutaneous\r\nnerve whereby it was rendered able, in however small a degree, to be\r\ndifferently affected by light and by darkness would be of benefit to the\r\ncreature presenting it; for the creature would thus be able to seek the\r\none and shun the other according to the requirements of its life. And\r\nbeing thus useful from the very moment of its inception, it would\r\nafterwards be gradually improved as variations of more and more utility\r\npresented themselves, until not only would finer and finer degrees of\r\ndifference between light and shade become perceptible, but even the\r\noutlines of solid bodies would begin to be appreciated. And so on, stage\r\nby stage, till from an ordinary nerve-ending in the skin is evolved the\r\neye of an eagle.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in this particular instance there is very good reason to\r\nsuppose that the modification of the cutaneous nerves in question began\r\nby a progressive increase in their sensitiveness to temperature.\r\nWherever dark pigment happened to be deposited in the skin--and we know\r\nthat in all animals it is apt to be deposited in points and patches, as\r\nit were by accident, or without any \"prophecy\" as to future uses,--the\r\ncutaneous nerves in its vicinity would be better able to appreciate the\r\ndifference between sun and shade in respect of temperature, even though\r\nas yet there were no change at all in these cutaneous nerves tending to\r\nmake them responsive to light. Now it is easy to see how, from such a\r\npurely accidental beginning, natural selection would have had from the\r\nfirst sufficient material to act upon. It being of advantage to a lowly\r\ncreature that it should distinguish with more and more delicacy, or with\r\nmore and more rapidity, between light and darkness by means of its\r\nthermal sensations, the pigment spots in the skin would be rendered\r\npermanent by natural selection, while the nerves in that region would by\r\nthe same agency be rendered more and more specialized as organs adapted\r\nto perceive changes of temperature, until from the stage of responding\r\nto the thermal rays of the non-luminous spectrum alone, they become\r\ncapable of responding also to luminous.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the first consideration which serves to invalidate\r\nthe Duke's premiss. The second consideration is, that very often an\r\norgan which began by being useful for the performance of one function,\r\nafter having been fully developed for the performance of that function,\r\nfinds itself, so to speak, accidentally fitted to the performance of\r\nsome other and even more important function, which it thereupon begins\r\nto discharge, and so to undergo a new course of adaptive development. In\r\nsuch cases, and so far as the new function is concerned, the difficulty\r\ntouching the first inception of an organ does not apply; for here the\r\norgan has already been built up by natural selection for one purpose,\r\nbefore it begins to discharge the other. As an example of such a case we\r\nmay take the lung of an air-breathing animal. Originally the lung was a\r\nswim-bladder, or float, and as such it was of use to the aquatic\r\nancestors of terrestrial animals. But as these ancestors gradually\r\nbecame more and more amphibious in their habits, the swim-bladder began\r\nmore and more to discharge the function of a lung, and so to take a\r\nwholly new point of departure as regards its developmental history. But\r\nclearly there is here no difficulty with regard to the inception of its\r\nnew function, because the organ was already well developed for one\r\npurpose before it began to serve another. Or, to take only one\r\nadditional example, there are few structures in the animal kingdom so\r\nremarkable in respect of adaptation as is the wing of a bird or a bat;\r\nand at first sight it might well appear that a wing could be of no\r\nconceivable use until it had already acquired enormous proportional\r\ndimensions, as well as an immense amount of special elaboration as to\r\nits general form, size of muscle, amount of blood-supply, and so on.\r\nFor, obviously, not until it had attained all these things could it even\r\nbegin to raise the animal in the air. But observe how fallacious is this\r\nargument. Although it is perfectly true that a wing could be of no use\r\n_as a wing_ until sufficiently developed to serve the purpose of flight,\r\nthis is merely to say that until it has become a wing it is no use as a\r\nwing. It does not, however, follow that on this account it was of no\r\nprior use for any other purpose. The first modifications of the\r\nfore-limb which ended in its becoming an organ of flight may very well\r\nhave been due to adapting it as an organ for increased rapidity of\r\nlocomotion of other kinds--whether on land as in the case of its now\r\ndegenerated form in the ostrich, or in water as in the case of the\r\nexpanded fins of fish. Indeed, we may see the actual process of\r\ntransition from the one function to the other in the case of\r\n\"flying-fish.\" Here the progressive expansion of the pectoral fins must\r\ncertainly have been always of use for continuously promoting rapidity of\r\nlocomotion through water; and thus natural selection may have\r\ncontinuously increased their development until they now begin to serve\r\nalso as wings for carrying the animal a short distance through air.\r\nAgain, in the case of the so-called flying squirrels we find the limbs\r\nunited to the body by means of large extensions of the skin, so-that\r\nwhen jumping from one tree to another the animal is able to sustain\r\nitself through a long distance in the air by merely spreading out its\r\nlimbs, and thus allowing the skin-extensions to act after the manner of\r\na parachute. Here, of course, we have not yet got a wing, any more than\r\nwe have in the case of the flying-fish; but we have the foundations laid\r\nfor the possible development of a future wing, upon a somewhat similar\r\nplan as that which has been so wonderfully perfected in the case of\r\nbats. And through all the stages of progressive expansion which the skin\r\nof the squirrel has undergone, the expansion has been of use, even\r\nthough it has not yet so much as begun to acquire the distinctive\r\nfunctions of a wing. Here, then, there is obviously nothing \"prophetic\"\r\nin the matter, any more than there was in the case of the swim-bladder\r\nand the lung, or in that of the nerve-ending and the eye. In short, it\r\nis the business of natural selection to secure the highest available\r\ndegree of adaptation for the time being; and, in doing this, it not\r\nunfrequently happens that an extreme development of a structure in one\r\ndirection (produced by natural selection for the sake of better and\r\nbetter adapting the structure to perform some particular function) ends\r\nby beginning to adapt it to the performance of some other function. And,\r\nwhenever this happens to be the case, natural selection forthwith begins\r\nto act upon the structure, so to speak, from a new point of departure.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the Duke's premiss--namely, that \"every modification\r\nof structure _must_ have been functionless _at first_, when it began to\r\nappear.\" This premiss is clearly opposed to observable fact. But now,\r\nthe second position is that, even if this were not so, the Duke's\r\nconclusion would not follow. This conclusion, it will be remembered, is,\r\nthat if incipient structures are useless, it necessarily follows that\r\nnatural selection can have had no part whatever in their inception. Now,\r\nthis is a conclusion which does not \"necessarily\" follow. Even if it be\r\ngranted that there are structures which in their first beginnings are\r\nnot of any use at all for any purpose, it is still possible that they\r\nmay owe their origin to natural selection--not indeed directly, but\r\nindirectly. This possibility arises from the occurrence in nature of a\r\nprinciple which has been called the Correlation of Growth.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, who has paid more attention to this matter than any other\r\nwriter, has shown, in considerable detail, that all the parts of any\r\ngiven organism are so intimately bound together, or so mutually\r\ndependent upon each other, that when one part is caused to change by\r\nmeans of natural selection, some other parts are very likely to undergo\r\nmodification as a consequence. For example, there are several kinds of\r\ndomesticated pigeons and fowls, which grow peculiar wing-like feathers\r\non the feet. These are quite unlike all the other feathers in the\r\nanimal, except those of the wing, to which they bear a very remarkable\r\nresemblance. Mr. Darwin records the case of a bantam where these\r\nwing-like feathers were nine inches in length, and I have myself seen a\r\npigeon where they reproduced upon the feet a close imitation of the\r\ndifferent kinds of feathers which occupy homologous positions in the\r\nwing--primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries all being distinctly\r\nrepeated in their proper anatomical relations. Furthermore, in this\r\ncase, as in most cases where such wing-feathers occur upon the feet, the\r\nthird and fourth toes were partly united by skin; and, as is well known,\r\nin the wing of a bird the third and fourth digits are completely united\r\nby skin; \"so that in feather-footed pigeons, not only does the exterior\r\nsurface support a row of long feathers, like wing-feathers [which, as\r\njust stated, may in some cases be obviously differentiated into\r\nprimaries, secondaries and tertiaries], but the very same digits which\r\nin the wing are completely united by skin become partially united by\r\nskin in the feet; and thus by the law of correlated variation of\r\nhomologous parts, we can understand the curious connexion of feathered\r\nlegs and membrane between the two outer toes[46].\" The illustration is\r\ndrawn from the specimen to which I have referred.\r\n\r\n    [46] _Variation of Plants and Animals_, vol. ii. p. 315.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 117.--Feather-footed pigeon. Drawn from nature.]\r\n\r\nMany similar instances of the same law are to be met with throughout\r\norganic nature; and it is evident that in this principle we find a\r\nconceivable explanation of the origin of such adaptive structures as\r\ncould not have been originated by natural selection acting directly upon\r\nthemselves: they may have been originated by natural selection\r\ndeveloping other adaptive structures elsewhere in the organism, the\r\ngradual evolution of which has entailed the production of these by\r\ncorrelation of growth. And, if so, when once started in this way, these\r\nstructures, because thus accidentally useful, will now themselves come\r\nunder the _direct_ action of natural selection, and so have their\r\nfurther evolution determined with or without the correlated association\r\nwhich first led to their inception.\r\n\r\nOf course it must be understood that in thus applying the principle of\r\ncorrelated growth, to explain the origin of adaptive structures where it\r\nis impossible to explain such origin by natural selection having from\r\nthe first acted directly upon these structures themselves, Darwinists\r\ndo not suppose that in all--or even in most--cases of correlated growth\r\nthe correlated structures are of use. On the contrary, it is well known\r\nthat structures due to correlated growth are, as a rule, useless. Being\r\nonly the by-products of adaptive changes going on elsewhere, in any\r\ngiven case the chances are against these correlated effects being\r\nthemselves of any utilitarian significance; and, therefore, as a matter\r\nof fact, correlated growths appear to be usually meaningless from the\r\npoint of view of adaptation. Still, on the doctrine of chances, it is\r\nto be expected that sometimes a change of structure which has thus been\r\nindirectly produced by correlation of growth might happen to prove\r\nuseful for some purpose or another; and in as many cases as such\r\nindirectly produced structures do prove useful, they will straightway\r\nbegin to be improved by the direct action of natural selection. In all\r\nsuch cases, therefore, we should have an explanation of the _origin_ of\r\nsuch a structure, which is the only point that we are now considering.\r\n\r\nI think, then, that all this effectually disposes of the doctrine of\r\n\"prophetic germs.\" But, before leaving the subject, I should like to\r\nmake one further statement of greater generality than any which I have\r\nhitherto advanced. This statement is, that we must remember how large a\r\nstock of meaningless structures are always being produced in the course\r\nof specific transmutations, not only by correlation of growth, which we\r\nhave just been considering, but also by the direct action of external\r\nconditions, together with the constant play of all the many and complex\r\nforces internal to organisms themselves. In other words, important as\r\nthe principle of correlation undoubtedly is, we must remember that even\r\nthis is very far from being the only principle which is concerned in the\r\norigination of structures that may or may not chance to be useful.\r\nTherefore, it is not only natural selection when operating indirectly\r\nthrough the correlation of growth that is competent to produce new\r\nstructures without reference to utility. In all the complex action and\r\nreaction of internal and external forces, new variations are perpetually\r\narising without any reference to utility, either present or future.\r\nAmong all this multitude of promiscuous variations, the chances must be\r\nthat some percentage will prove of some service, either from the first\r\nmoment of their appearance, or else after they have undergone some\r\namount of development. Such development prior to utility may be due,\r\neither to correlation of growth, to the structure having previously\r\nperformed some other function, as already explained, or else to a\r\ncontinued operation of the causes which were concerned in the first\r\nappearance of originally useless characters. In a series of chapters\r\nwhich will be devoted to the whole question of utility in the next\r\nvolume, I shall hope to give very good reasons for concluding that\r\nuseless characters are not only of highly frequent occurrence, but are\r\ndue to a variety of other causes besides correlation of growth. And, if\r\nso, the possibility of originally useless characters happening in some\r\ncases to become, by increased development, useful characters, is\r\ncorrespondingly increased. Among a hundred varietal or specific\r\ncharacters which are directly produced in as many different species by a\r\nchange of climate, for example, some five or six may be _potentially_\r\nuseful: that is to say, characters thus adventitiously produced in an\r\nincipient form may only require to be further developed by a continuance\r\nof the same causes as first originated them, in order that some\r\npercentage of the whole number shall become of some degree of use. Those\r\nprofessed followers of Darwin, therefore, who without any reason--or, as\r\nit appears to me, against all reason--deny the possibility of useless\r\nspecific characters in any case or in any degree (unless correlated with\r\nuseful characters), are playing into the hands of Darwin's critics by\r\nindirectly countenancing the difficulty which we are now considering.\r\nFor, if correlation of growth is unreasonably supposed to be the only\r\npossible cause of the origin of incipient structures which are not\r\nuseful from the first moment of their inception, clearly the field is\r\ngreatly narrowed as regards the occurrence of incipient characters\r\nsufficient in amount--and, still more, in constancy of appearance and\r\npersistency of transmission--to admit of furnishing material for the\r\nworking of natural selection. But in the measure that incipient\r\ncharacters--whether varietal or specific--are recognised as not always\r\nor \"necessarily\" useful from the moment of their inception, and yet\r\ncapable of being developed to a certain extent by the causes which first\r\nled to their occurrence, in that measure is this line of criticism\r\nclosed. For of all the variations which thus occur, it is only those\r\nwhich afterwards prove of any use that are laid hold upon and wrought up\r\nby natural selection into adaptive structures, or working organs. And,\r\ntherefore, what we see in organic nature is the net outcome of the\r\ndevelopment of all the happy chances. So it comes that the appearance\r\npresented by organic nature as a whole is that of a continual fulfilment\r\nof structural prophecies, when, in point of fact, if we had a similar\r\nrecord of all the other variations it would be seen that possibly not\r\none such prophecy in a thousand is ever destined to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere, then, I feel justified in finally taking leave of the difficulty\r\nfrom the uselessness of incipient organs, as this difficulty has been\r\npresented, in varying degrees of emphasis, by the Duke of Argyll, Mr.\r\nMivart, Professors Naegeli, Bronn, Broca, Eimer, and, indeed, by all\r\nother writers who have hitherto advanced it. For, as thus presented, I\r\nthink I have shown that it admits of being adequately met. But now, I\r\nmust confess, to me individually it does appear that behind this\r\nerroneous presentation of the difficulty there lies another question,\r\nwhich is deserving of much more serious attention. For although it\r\nadmits of being easily shown--as I have just shown--that the difficulty\r\nas ordinarily presented fails on account of its extravagance, the\r\nquestion remains whether, if stated with more moderation, a real\r\ndifficulty might not be found to remain.\r\n\r\nMy quarrel with the conclusion, like my quarrel with the premiss, is due\r\nto its universality. By saying in the premiss that _all_ incipient\r\norgans are _necessarily_ useless at the time of their inception, these\r\nwriters admit of being controverted by fact; and by saying in the\r\nconclusion that, _if_ all incipient organs are useless, it necessarily\r\nfollows that in _no_ case can natural selection have been the cause of\r\nbuilding up an organ until it becomes useful, they admit of being\r\ncontroverted by logic. For, even if the premiss were true in\r\nfact--namely, that all incipient organs are useless at the time of their\r\ninception,--it would not necessarily follow that in no case could\r\nnatural selection build up a useless structure into a useful one;\r\nbecause, although it is true that in no case can natural selection do\r\nthis by acting on a useless structure _directly_, it may do so by acting\r\non the useless structure _indirectly_, through its direct action on some\r\nother part of the organism with which the useless structure happens to\r\nbe correlated. Moreover, as I believe, and will subsequently endeavour\r\nto prove, there is abundant evidence to show that incipient characters\r\nare often developed to a large extent by causes other than natural\r\nselection (or apart from any reference to utility), with the result that\r\nsome of them thus happen to become of use, when, of course, the supposed\r\ndifficulty is at an end.\r\n\r\nBut although it is thus easy to dispose of both the propositions in\r\nquestion, on account of their universality, stated more carefully they\r\nwould require, as I have said, more careful consideration. Thus, if it\r\nhad been said that some incipient organs are _presumably_ useless at the\r\ntime of their inception, and that in _some of these cases_ it is\r\ndifficult, or impossible, to conceive how the principle of correlation,\r\nor any other principle hitherto suggested, can apply--then the question\r\nwould have been raised from the sphere of logical discussion to that of\r\nbiological fact. And the new question thus raised would have to be\r\ndebated, no longer on the ground of general or abstract principles, but\r\non that of special or concrete cases. Now until within the last year or\r\ntwo it has not been easy to find such a special or concrete case--that\r\nis to say, a case which can be pointed to as apparently excluding the\r\npossibility of natural selection having had anything to do with the\r\ngenesis of an unquestionably adaptive structure. But eventually such a\r\ncase has arisen, and the Duke of Argyll has not been slow in perceiving\r\nits importance. This case is the electric organ in the tail of the\r\nskate. No sooner had Professor Cossar Ewart published an abstract of his\r\nfirst paper on this subject, than the Duke seized upon it as a case for\r\nwhich, as he said, he had long been waiting--namely, the case of an\r\n_adaptive_ organ the genesis of which _could not possibly_ be attributed\r\nto natural selection, and must therefore be attributed to supernatural\r\ndesign. Now, I do not deny that he is here in possession of an admirable\r\ncase--a case, indeed, so admirable that it almost seems to have been\r\nspecially designed for the discomfiture of Darwinians. Therefore, in\r\norder to do it full justice, I will show that it is even more formidable\r\nthan the Duke of Argyll has represented.\r\n\r\nElectric organs are known to occur in several widely different kinds of\r\nfish--such as the _Gymnotus_ and _Torpedo_. Wherever these organs do\r\noccur, they perform the function of electric batteries in storing and\r\ndischarging electricity in the form of more or less powerful shocks.\r\nHere, then, we have a function which is of obvious use to the fish for\r\npurposes both of offence and defence. These organs are everywhere\r\ncomposed of a transformation of muscular, together with an enormous\r\ndevelopment of nervous tissue; but inasmuch as they occupy different\r\npositions, and are also in other respects dissimilar in the different\r\nzoological groups of fishes where they occur, no difficulty can be\r\nalleged as to these analogous organs being likewise homologous in\r\ndifferent divisions of the aquatic vertebrata.\r\n\r\nNow, in the particular case of the skate, the organ is situated in the\r\ntail, where it is of a spindle-like form, measuring, in a large fish,\r\nabout two feet in length by about an inch in diameter at the middle of\r\nthe spindle. Although its structure is throughout as complex and perfect\r\nas that of the electric organ in _Gymnotus_ or _Torpedo_, its smaller\r\nsize does not admit of its generating a sufficient amount of\r\nelectricity to yield a discharge that can be felt by the hand.\r\nNevertheless, that it does discharge under suitable stimulation has been\r\nproved by Professor Burdon Sanderson by means of a telephone; for he\r\nfound that every time he stimulated the animal its electrical discharge\r\nwas rendered audible by the telephone. Here, then, the difficulty\r\narises. For of what conceivable use is such an organ to its possessor?\r\nWe can scarcely suppose that any aquatic animal is more sensitive to\r\nelectric shocks than is the human hand; and even if such were the case,\r\na discharge of so feeble a kind taking place in water would be\r\nshort-circuited in the immediate vicinity of the skate itself. So there\r\ncan be no doubt that such weak discharges as the skate is able to\r\ndeliver must be wholly imperceptible alike to prey and to enemies. Yet\r\nfor the delivery of such discharges there is provided an organ of such\r\nhigh peculiarity and huge complexity, that, regarded as a piece of\r\nliving mechanism, it deserves to rank as at once the most extremely\r\nspecialized and the most highly elaborated structure in the whole animal\r\nkingdom. Thousands of separately formed elements are ranged in row after\r\nrow, all electrically insulated one from another, and packed away into\r\nthe smallest possible space, with the obvious end, or purpose, of\r\nconspiring together for the simultaneous delivery of an electric shock.\r\nNevertheless, the shock when delivered is, as we have just seen, too\r\nslight to be of any conceivable use to the skate. Therefore it appears\r\nimpossible to suggest how this astonishing structure--much more\r\nastonishing, in my opinion, than the human eye or the human hand--can\r\never have been begun, or afterwards developed, by means of natural\r\nselection. For if it be not even yet of any conceivable use to its\r\npossessor, clearly thus far survival of the fittest can have had nothing\r\nto do with its formation. On the other hand, seeing that electric organs\r\nwhen of larger size, as in the _Gymnotus_ and _Torpedo_, are of obvious\r\nuse to their possessors, the facts of the case, so far as the skate is\r\nconcerned, assuredly do appear to sanction the doctrine of \"prophetic\r\ngerms.\" The organ in the skate seems to be on its way towards becoming\r\nsuch an organ as we meet with in these other animals; and, therefore,\r\nunless we can show that it is now, and in all previous stages of its\r\nevolution has throughout been, of use to the skate, the facts do present\r\na serious difficulty to the theory of natural selection, while they\r\nreadily lend themselves to the interpretation of a disposing or\r\nfore-ordaining mind, which knows how to construct an electric battery by\r\nthus transforming muscular tissue into electric tissue, and is now\r\nactually in process of constructing such an apparatus for the\r\nprospective benefit of future creatures.\r\n\r\nShould it be suggested that possibly the electric organ of the skate may\r\nbe in process of degeneration, and therefore that it is now the\r\npractically functionless remnant of an organ which in the ancestors of\r\nthe skate was of larger size and functional use--against so obvious a\r\nsuggestion there lie the whole results of Professor Ewart's\r\ninvestigations, which go to indicate that the organ is here not in a\r\nstage of degeneration, but of evolution. For instance, in _Raia\r\nradiata_, it does not begin to be formed out of the muscular tissue\r\nuntil some time after the animal has left the egg-capsule, and assumed\r\nall the normal proportions (though not yet the size) of the adult\r\ncreature. The organ, therefore, is one of the very latest to appear in\r\nthe ontogeny of _R. radiata_; and, moreover, it does not attain its full\r\n_development_ (i. e. not merely _growth_, but transforming of muscular\r\nfibres into electrical elements) till the fish attains maturity. Read in\r\nthe light of embryology, these facts prove, (1) that the electric organ\r\nof _R. radiata_ must be one of the very latest products of the\r\nanimal's phylogeny; and, (2) that as yet, at all events, it has not\r\nbegun to degenerate. But, if not, it must either be at a stand-still, or\r\nit must be in course of further evolution; and, whichever of these\r\nalternatives we adopt, the difficulty of accounting for its present\r\ncondition remains. In this connexion also it is worth while to remark\r\nthat the electric organ, even after it has attained its full\r\n_development_, continues its _growth_ with the growth of the fish, and\r\nthis in a much higher ratio, either than the tail alone, or the whole\r\nanimal. Lastly, Prof. Burdon Sanderson finds that _section for section_\r\nthe organ in the skate is as efficient as it is in _Torpedo_. It is\r\nevident that these facts also point to the skate's organ being in course\r\nof phylogenetic evolution.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 118.--_Raia radiata_, representing the life size\r\n    of the youngest individual in which muscle fibres have been found\r\n    developing into electric cells].\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 119.--Electric organ of the skate. The left-hand\r\n    drawing (i) represents the entire organ (natural size) of a\r\n    full-grown _r. radiata_. This is a small skate, which rarely exceeds\r\n    50 centms. in length; but in the large _r. batis_, the organ may\r\n    exceed two feet in length. The other drawings represent single\r\n    muscle-fibres in successive stages of transition. In the first of\r\n    the series (ii) the motor plate, and the nerves connected with it,\r\n    have already been considerably enlarged. In the other three\r\n    specimens, the fibre becomes more and more club-like, and eventually\r\n    cup-like. These changes of shape are expressive of great changes of\r\n    structure, as may be seen in the last of the series (v), where the\r\n    shallow cup is seen in partial section. The electric plate lines the\r\n    concavity of the cup, and is richly supplied with nerves (only a few\r\n    of which are represented in the last drawing); the thick walls of\r\n    the cup are composed of muscular fibres, the striation of which is\r\n    distinctly visible.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 120.--Electric cells of _raia radiata_. The\r\n    drawing on the left represents one of the clubs magnified, as in the\r\n    preceding wood-cut. The drawing on the right represents a number of\r\n    these clubs, less highly magnified, _in situ_.]\r\n\r\nAgain, it cannot be answered that the principle of correlation may be\r\ndrawn upon in mitigation of the difficulty. The structure of the\r\nelectric organ is far too elaborate, far too specialized, and far too\r\nobviously directed to a particular end, to admit of our conceivably\r\nsupposing it due to any accidental correlation with structural changes\r\ngoing on elsewhere. Even as regards the initial changes of\r\nmuscle-elements into electrical-elements, I do not think the principle\r\nof correlation can be reasonably adduced by way of explanation; for, as\r\nshown in the illustrations, even this initial change is most\r\nextraordinarily peculiar, elaborate, and specialized. But, be this as it\r\nmay, I am perfectly certain that the principle of correlation cannot\r\npossibly be adduced to explain the subsequent _association of these\r\nelectrical elements into an electric battery_, actuated by a special\r\nnervous mechanism of enormous size and elaboration--unless of course,\r\nthe progress of such a structure were assumed to have been throughout of\r\nsome utility. Under this supposition, however, the principle of\r\ncorrelation would be forsaken in favour of that of natural selection;\r\nand we should again be in the presence of the same difficulty as that\r\nwith which we started.\r\n\r\nBut now, and further, if we do thus abandon correlation in favour of\r\nnatural selection, and therefore if for the sake of saving an hypothesis\r\nwe assume that the organ as it now stands _must_ be of some use to the\r\nexisting skate, we should still have to face the question--Of what\r\nconceivable use can those initial stages of its formation have been,\r\nwhen first the muscle-elements began to be changed into the very\r\ndifferent electrical-elements, and when therefore they became useless as\r\nmuscles while not yet capable of performing even so much of the\r\nelectrical function as they now perform?\r\n\r\nLastly, we must remember that not only have we here the most highly\r\nspecialized, the most complex, and altogether the most elaboratively\r\nadaptive organ in the animal kingdom; but also that in the formation of\r\nthis structure there has been needed an altogether unparalleled\r\nexpenditure of the most physiologically expensive of all\r\nmaterials--namely, nervous tissue. Whether estimated by volume or by\r\nweight, the quantity of nervous tissue which is consumed in the electric\r\norgan of the skate is in excess of all the rest of the nervous system\r\nput together. It is needless to say that nowhere else in the animal\r\nkingdom--except, of course, in other electric fishes--is there any\r\napproach to so enormous a development of nervous tissue for the\r\ndischarge of a special function. Therefore, as nervous tissue is,\r\nphysiologically speaking, the most valuable of all materials, we are\r\nforced to conclude that natural selection ought strongly to have\r\n_opposed_ the evolution of such organs, unless from the first moment of\r\ntheir inception, and throughout the whole course of their development,\r\nthey were of some such paramount importance as biologically to justify\r\nso unexampled an expenditure. Yet this paramount importance does not\r\nadmit of being so much as surmised, even where the organ has already\r\nattained the size and degree of elaboration which it presents in the\r\nskate.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these considerations taken together, I freely confess\r\nthat the difficulty presented by this case appears to me of a magnitude\r\nand importance altogether unequalled by that of any other single\r\ncase--or any series of cases--which has hitherto been encountered by the\r\ntheory of natural selection. So that, if there were many other cases of\r\nthe like kind to be met with in nature, I should myself at once allow\r\nthat the theory of natural selection would have to be discarded. But\r\ninasmuch as this particular case stands so far entirely by itself, and\r\ntherefore out of analogy with thousands, or even millions, of other\r\ncases throughout the whole range of organic nature, I am constrained to\r\nfeel it more probable that the electric organ of the skate will some day\r\nadmit of being marshalled under the general law of natural selection--in\r\njust the same way as proved to be the case with the conspicuous\r\ncolouring of those caterpillars, which, as explained in the last\r\nchapter, at one time seemed to constitute a serious difficulty to the\r\ntheory, and yet, through a better knowledge of all the relations\r\ninvolved, has now come to constitute one of the strongest witnesses in\r\nits favour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now stated all the objections of any importance which have\r\nhitherto been brought against the theory of natural selection, excepting\r\nthree, which I left to be dealt with together because they form a\r\nlogically connected group. With a brief consideration of these,\r\ntherefore, I will bring this chapter to a close.\r\n\r\nThe three objections to which I allude are, (1) that a large\r\nproportional number of specific, as well as of higher taxonomic\r\ncharacters, are seemingly useless characters, and therefore do not lend\r\nthemselves to explanation by the Darwinian theory; (2) that the most\r\ngeneral of all specific characters--viz. cross-infertility between\r\nallied species--cannot possibly be due to natural selection, as is\r\ndemonstrated by Darwin himself; (3) that the swamping effects of free\r\nintercrossing must always render impossible by natural selection alone\r\nany evolution of species in divergent (as distinguished from serial)\r\nlines of change.\r\n\r\nThese three objections have been urged from time to time by not a few of\r\nthe most eminent botanists and zoologists of our century; and from one\r\npoint of view I cannot myself have the smallest doubt that the\r\nobjections thus advanced are not only valid in themselves, but also by\r\nfar the most formidable objections which the theory of natural selection\r\nhas encountered. From another point of view, however, I am equally\r\nconvinced that they all admit of absolute annihilation. This strong\r\nantithesis arises, as I have said, from differences of standpoint, or\r\nfrom differences in the view which we take of the theory of natural\r\nselection itself. If we understand this theory to set forth natural\r\nselection as the sole cause of organic evolution, then all the above\r\nobjections to the theory are not merely, as already stated, valid and\r\nformidable, but as I will now add, logically insurmountable. On the\r\nother hand, if we take theory to consist merely in setting forth natural\r\nselection as a factor of organic evolution, even although we believe it\r\nto have been the chief factor or principal cause, all the three\r\nobjections in question necessarily vanish. For in this case, even if it\r\nbe satisfactorily proved that the theory of natural selection is unable\r\nto explain the three classes of facts above mentioned, the theory is not\r\nthereby affected: facts of each and all of these classes may be\r\nconsistently left by the theory to be explained by causes other than\r\nnatural selection--whether these be so far capable or incapable of\r\nhypothetical formulation. Thus it is evident that whether the three\r\nobjections above named are to be regarded as logically insurmountable by\r\nthe theory, or as logically non-existent in respect to it, depends\r\nsimply upon the manner in which the theory itself is stated.\r\n\r\nIn the next volume a great deal more will have to be said upon these\r\nmatters--especially with regard to the causes other than natural\r\nselection which in my opinion are capable of explaining these so-called\r\n\"difficulties.\" In the present connexion, however, all I have attempted\r\nto show is, that, whatever may be thought touching the supplementary\r\ntheories whereby I shall endeavour to explain the facts of inutility,\r\ncross-sterility, and non-occurrence of free intercrossing, no one of\r\nthese facts is entitled to rank as an objection against the theory of\r\nnatural selection, unless we understand this theory to claim an\r\nexclusive prerogative in the field of organic evolution. This, as we\r\nhave previously seen, is what Mr. Wallace does claim for it; while on\r\nthe other hand, Mr. Darwin expressly--and even vehemently--repudiates\r\nthe claim: from which it follows that all the three main objections\r\nagainst the theory of natural selection are objections which vitally\r\naffect the theory only as it has been stated and upheld by Wallace. As\r\nthe theory has been stated and upheld by Darwin, all these objections\r\nare irrelevant. This is a fact which I had not myself perceived at the\r\ntime when I mentioned these objections in a paper entitled\r\n_Physiological Selection_, which was published in 1886. The discussions\r\nto which that paper gave rise, however, led me to consider these matters\r\nmore closely; and further study of Darwin's writings, with these matters\r\nspecially in view, has led me to see that none of the objections in\r\nquestion are relevant to his theory, as distinguished from that of Mr.\r\nWallace. This, I acknowledge, I ought to have perceived before I\r\npublished the paper just alluded to; but in those days I had had no\r\noccasion to follow out the differences between Darwin and Wallace to all\r\ntheir consequences, and therefore adopted the prevalent view that their\r\ntheories of evolution were virtually identical. Now, however, I have\r\nendeavoured to make it clear that the points wherein they differ involve\r\nthe important consequences above set forth. All these the most\r\nformidable objections against the theory of natural selection arise\r\nsimply and solely from what I conceive to be the erroneous manner in\r\nwhich the theory has been presented by Darwin's distinguished colleague.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now considered, as impartially as I can, all the main criticisms\r\nand objections which have been brought against the theory of natural\r\nselection; and the result is to show that, neither singly nor\r\ncollectively, are they entitled to much weight. On the other hand, as\r\nwe have seen in the preceding chapter, there is a vast accumulation of\r\nevidence in favour of the theory. Hence, it is no wonder that the theory\r\nhas now been accepted by all naturalists, with scarcely any one notable\r\nexception, as at any rate the best working hypothesis which has ever\r\nbeen propounded whereby to explain the facts of organic evolution.\r\nMoreover, in the opinion of those most competent to judge, the theory is\r\nentitled to be regarded as something very much more than a working\r\nhypothesis: it is held to be virtually a completed induction, or, in\r\nother words, the proved exhibition of a general law, whereby the\r\ncausation of organic evolution admits of being in large part--if not\r\naltogether--explained.\r\n\r\nNow, whether or not we subscribe to this latter conclusion ought, I\r\nthink, to depend upon what we mean by an explanation in the case which\r\nis before us. If we mean only that, given the large class of known facts\r\nand unknown causes which are conveniently summarized under the terms\r\nHeredity and Variability, then the further facts of Struggle and\r\nSurvival serve, in some considerable degree or another, to account for\r\nthe phenomena of adaptive evolution, I cannot see any room to question\r\nthat the evidence is sufficient to prove the statement. But it is clear\r\nthat by taking for granted these great facts of Heredity and\r\nVariability, we have assumed the larger part of the problem as a whole.\r\nOr, more correctly, by thus generalizing, in a merely verbal form, all\r\nthe unknown causes which are concerned in these two great factors of the\r\nprocess in question, we are not so much as attempting to explain the\r\nprecedent causation which serves as a condition to the process. Much\r\nmore than half the battle would already have been won, had Darwin's\r\npredecessors been able to explain the causes of Heredity and Variation;\r\nhence it is but a very partial victory which we have hitherto gained in\r\nour recent discovery of the effects of Struggle and Survival.\r\n\r\nYet partial though it be in relation to the whole battle, in itself, or\r\nconsidered absolutely, there can be no reasonable doubt that it\r\nconstitutes the greatest single victory which has ever been gained by\r\nthe science of Biology. For this very reason, however, it behoves us to\r\nconsider all the more carefully the extent to which it goes. But my\r\ndiscussion of this matter must be relegated to the next volume, where I\r\nhope to give abundant proof of the soundness of Darwin's judgment as\r\nconveyed in the words:--\"I am convinced that natural selection has been\r\nthe main, but not the exclusive, means of modification.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF SEXUAL SELECTION, AND CONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the explanatory value of the Darwinian theory of natural\r\nselection is, as we have now seen, incalculably great, it nevertheless\r\ndoes not meet those phenomena of organic nature which perhaps more than\r\nany other attract the general attention, as well as the general\r\nadmiration, of mankind: I mean all that class of phenomena which go to\r\nconstitute the Beautiful. Whatever value beauty as such may have, it\r\nclearly has not a life-preserving value. The gorgeous plumage of a\r\npeacock, for instance, is of no advantage to the peacock in his struggle\r\nfor life, and therefore cannot be attributed to the agency of natural\r\nselection. Now this fact of beauty in organic structures is a fact of\r\nwide generality--almost as wide, indeed, as is the fact of their\r\nutility. Mr. Darwin, therefore, suggested another hypothesis whereby to\r\nrender a scientific explanation of this fact. Just as by his theory of\r\nnatural selection he sought to explain the major fact of utility, so did\r\nhe endeavour to explain the minor fact of beauty by a theory of what he\r\ntermed Sexual Selection.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of observation that the higher animals do not pair\r\nindiscriminately; but that the members of either sex prefer those\r\nindividuals of the opposite sex which are to them most attractive. It is\r\nimportant to understand _in limine_ that nobody has ever attempted to\r\nchallenge this statement. In other words, it is an unquestionable fact\r\nthat among many of the higher animals there literally and habitually\r\noccurs a _sexual selection_; and this fact is not a matter of inference,\r\nbut, as I have said, a matter of observation. The inference only begins\r\nwhere, from this observable fact, it is argued,--1st, that the sexual\r\nselection has reference to an aesthetic taste on the part of the animals\r\nthemselves; and 2nd, that, supposing the selection to be determined by\r\nsuch a taste, the cause thus given is adequate to explain the phenomena\r\nof beauty which are presented by these animals. I will consider these\r\ntwo points separately.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence which Darwin has collected, it appears to me\r\nimpossible to doubt that an aesthetic sense is displayed by many birds,\r\nand not a few mammals. This of course does not necessarily imply that\r\nthe _standards_ of such a sense are the same as our own; nor does it\r\nnecessarily imply that there is any constant relation between such a\r\nsense and high levels of intelligence in other respects. In point of\r\nfact, such is certainly not the case, because the best evidence that we\r\nhave of an aesthetic sense in animals is derived from birds, and not from\r\nmammals. The most cogent cases to quote in this connexion are those of\r\nthe numerous species of birds which habitually adorn their nests with\r\ngaily coloured feathers, wool, cotton, or any other gaudy materials\r\nwhich they may find lying about the woods and fields. In many cases a\r\nmarked preference is shown for particular objects--as, for instance, in\r\nthe case of the Syrian nut-hatch, which chooses the iridescent wings of\r\ninsects, or that of the great crested fly-catcher, which similarly\r\nchooses the cast-off skins of snakes. But no doubt the most remarkable\r\nof these cases is that of the baya-bird of Asia, which after having\r\ncompleted its bottle-shaped and chambered nest[47], studs it over with\r\nsmall lumps of clay, both inside and out, upon which the cock-bird\r\nsticks fire-flies, apparently for the sole purpose of securing a\r\nbrilliantly decorative effect. Other birds, such as the hammer-head of\r\nAfrica, adorn the surroundings of their nests (which are built upon the\r\nground) with shells, bones, pieces of broken glass and earthenware, or\r\nany objects of a bright and conspicuous character which they may happen\r\nto find. The most consummate artists in this respect are, however, the\r\nbower-birds; for the species of this family construct elaborate\r\nplay-houses in the form of arched tunnels, built of twigs upon the\r\nground. Through and around such a tunnel they chase one another; and it\r\nis always observable that not only is the floor paved with a great\r\ncollection of shells, bones, coloured stones, and any other brilliant\r\nobjects which they are able to carry in their beaks, but also that the\r\nwalls are decorated with the most gaudy articles which the birds can\r\nfind. There is one genus, in Papua, which even goes so far as to provide\r\nthe theatre with a surrounding garden. A level piece of ground is\r\nselected as a site for the building. The latter is about two feet high,\r\nand constructed round the growing stalk of a shrub, which therefore\r\nserves as a central pillar to which the frame-work of the roof is\r\nattached. Twigs are woven into this frame-work until the whole is\r\nrendered rain-proof. The tent thus erected is about nine feet in\r\ncircumference at its base, and presents a large arch as an entrance. The\r\ncentral pillar is banked up with moss at its base, and a gallery is\r\nbuilt round the interior of the edifice. This gallery is decorated with\r\nflowers, fruits, fungi, &c. These are also spread over the garden, which\r\ncovers about the same area as the play-house. The flowers are said to\r\nbe removed when they fade, while fresh ones are gathered to supply their\r\nplaces. Thus the garden is always kept bright with flowers, as well as\r\nwith the brilliant green of mosses, which are collected and distributed\r\nin patches, resembling tiny lawns.\r\n\r\n    [47] The chambers are three in number. The two upper ones are\r\n    occupied respectively by the male and the sitting female. The lower\r\n    one serves as a general living room when the young are hatched.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 121.--The Garden Bower-bird (_Amblyornis\r\n    inornata_). Reduced from _Gould's Birds of New Guinea_ to 1/4 nat.\r\n    size.]\r\n\r\nNow these sundry cases alone seem to prove a high degree of the aesthetic\r\nsense as occurring among birds; for, it is needless to say, none of the\r\nfacts just mentioned can be due to natural selection, seeing that they\r\nhave no reference to utility, or the preservation of life. But if an\r\naesthetic sense occurs in birds, we should expect, on _a priori_ grounds,\r\nthat it would probably be exercised with reference to the personal\r\nappearance of the sexes. And this expectation is fully realized. For it\r\nis an observable fact that in most species of birds where the males are\r\nremarkable for the brilliancy of their plumage, not only is this\r\nbrilliancy most remarkable during the pairing season, but at this season\r\nalso the male birds take elaborate pains to display their charms before\r\nthe females. Then it is that the peacock erects his tail to strut round\r\nand round the hens, taking care always to present to them a front view,\r\nwhere the coloration is most gorgeous. And the same is true of all other\r\ngaily coloured male birds. During the pairing season they actively\r\ncompete with one another in exhibiting their attractiveness to the\r\nfemales; and in many cases there are added all sorts of extraordinary\r\nantics in the way of dancings and crowings. Again, in the case of all\r\nsong-birds, the object of the singing is to please the females; and for\r\nthis purpose the males rival one another to the best of their musical\r\nability.\r\n\r\nThus there can be no question that the courtship of birds is a highly\r\nelaborate business, in which the males do their best to surpass one\r\nanother in charming the females. Obviously the inference is that the\r\nmales do not take all this trouble for nothing; but that the females\r\ngive their consent to pair with the males whose personal appearance, or\r\nwhose voice, proves to be the most attractive. But, if so, the young of\r\nthe male bird who is thus _selected_ will inherit his superior beauty;\r\nand thus, in successive generations, a continuous advance will be made\r\nin the beauty of plumage or of song, as the case may be,--both the\r\norigin and development of beauty in the animal world being thus supposed\r\ndue to the aesthetic taste of animals themselves.\r\n\r\nSuch is the theory of sexual selection in its main outlines; and with\r\nregard to it we must begin by noting two things which are of most\r\nimportance. In the first place, it is a theory wholly and completely\r\ndistinct from the theory of natural selection; so that any truth or\r\nerror in the one does not in the least affect the other. The second\r\npoint is, that there is not so great a wealth of evidence in favour of\r\nsexual selection as there is in favour of natural selection; and,\r\ntherefore, that while all naturalists nowadays accept natural selection\r\nas _a_ (whether or not _the_) cause of adaptive, useful, or\r\nlife-preserving structures, there is no such universal--but only a very\r\ngeneral--agreement with reference to sexual selection as a cause of\r\ndecorative, beautiful, or life-embellishing structures. Nevertheless,\r\nthe evidence in favour of sexual selection is both large in amount and\r\nmassive in weight.\r\n\r\nOur consideration of this evidence will bring us to the second division\r\nof our subject, as previously marked out for discussion--namely,\r\ngranting that an aesthetic sense occurs in certain large divisions of the\r\nanimal kingdom, what is the proof that such a sense is a cause of the\r\nbeauty which is presented by the animals in question?\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to state this proof, however, it is desirable to\r\nobserve that under the theory of sexual selection Darwin has included\r\ntwo essentially different classes of facts. For besides the large class\r\nof facts to which I have thus far been alluding,--i. e. the cases where\r\ntwo sexes of the same species differ from one another in respect of\r\nornamentation,--there is another class of facts equally important,\r\nnamely, the cases where the two sexes of the same species differ from\r\none another in respect of size, strength, and the possession of natural\r\nweapons, such as spurs, horns, &c. In most of these cases it is the\r\nmales which are thus superiorly endowed; and it is a matter of\r\nobservation that in all cases where they are so endowed they use their\r\nsuperior strength and natural weapons for fighting together, in order to\r\nsecure possession of the females. Hence results what Mr. Darwin has\r\ncalled the Law of Battle between males of the same species; and this law\r\nof battle he includes under his theory of sexual selection. But it is\r\nevident that the principle which is operative in the law of battle\r\ndiffers from the principle which is concerned in the form of sexual\r\nselection that has to do with embellishment, and consequent charm. The\r\nlaw of battle, in fact, more nearly approaches the law of natural\r\nselection; seeing that it expresses the natural advantages of brute\r\nforce in the struggling of rival animals, and so frequently results in\r\n_death of the less fitted_, as distinguished from a mere failure to\r\npropagate. Now against this doctrine of the law of battle, and the\r\nconsequences to which it leads in the superior fighting powers of male\r\nanimals, no objection has been raised in any quarter. It is only with\r\nregard to the other aspect of the theory of sexual selection--or that\r\nwhich is concerned with the superior embellishment of male animals--that\r\nany difference of opinion obtains. I will now proceed to give the main\r\narguments on both sides of this question, beginning with a _resume_ of\r\nthe evidences in favour of sexual selection.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the fact that secondary sexual characters of the\r\nembellishing kind are so generally restricted to the male sex in itself\r\nseems to constitute very cogent proof that, in some way or another, such\r\ncharacters are connected with the part which is played by the male in\r\nthe act of propagation. Moreover, secondary sexual characters of this\r\nkind are of quite as general occurrence as are those of the other kind\r\nwhich have to do with rivalry in battle; and the former are usually of\r\nthe more elaborate description. Therefore, as there is no doubt that\r\nsecondary sexual characters of the one order have an immediate purpose\r\nto serve in the act of propagation, we are by this close analogy\r\nconfirmed in our surmise that secondary sexual characters of the other,\r\nand still more elaborate, order are likewise so concerned. Moreover,\r\nthis view of their meaning becomes still further strengthened when we\r\ntake into consideration the following facts. Namely, (_a_) secondary\r\nsexual characters of the embellishing kind are, as a rule, developed\r\nonly at maturity; and most frequently during only a part of the year,\r\nwhich is invariably the breeding season: (_b_) they are always more or\r\nless seriously affected by emasculation: (_c_) they are always, and\r\nonly, displayed in perfection during the act of courtship: (_d_) then,\r\nhowever, they are displayed with the most elaborate pains; yet always,\r\nand only, before the females: (_e_) they appear, at all events in many\r\ncases, to have the effect of charming the females into a performance of\r\nthe sexual act; while it is certain that in many cases, both among\r\nquadrupeds and birds, individuals of the one sex are capable of feeling\r\na strong antipathy against, or a strong preference for, certain\r\nindividuals of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nSuch are the main lines of evidence in favour of the theory of sexual\r\nselection. And although it is enough that some of them should be merely\r\nstated as above in order that their immense significance should become\r\napparent, in the case of others a bare statement is not sufficient for\r\nthis purpose. More especially is this the case as regards the enormous\r\nprofusion, variety, and elaboration of sexually-embellishing characters\r\nwhich occur in birds and mammals--not to mention several divisions of\r\nArthropoda; together with the extraordinary amount of trouble which, in\r\na no less extraordinary number of different ways, is taken by the male\r\nanimals to display their embellishments before the females. And even in\r\nmany cases where to our eyes there is no particular embellishment to\r\ndisplay, the process of courtship consists in such an elaborate\r\nperformance of dancings, struttings, and attitudinizings that it is\r\nscarcely possible to doubt their object is to incite the opposite sex.\r\nHere, for instance, is a series of drawings illustrating the courtship\r\nof spiders. I choose this case as an example, partly because it is the\r\none which has been published most recently, and partly because it is of\r\nparticular interest as occurring so low down in the zoological scale. I\r\nam indebted to the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Peckham for permission to\r\nreproduce these few selected drawings from their very admirable work,\r\nwhich is published by the Natural History Society of Wisconsin, U.S. It\r\nis evident at a glance that all these elaborate, and to our eyes\r\nludicrous, performances are more suggestive of incitation than of any\r\nother imaginable purpose. And this view of the matter is strongly\r\ncorroborated by the fact that it is the most brightly coloured parts of\r\nthe male spiders which are most obtruded upon the notice of the female\r\nby these peculiar attitudes--in just the same way as is invariably the\r\ncase in the analogous phenomena of courtship among birds, insects, &c.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 122.--Courtship of Spiders. A few examples of\r\n    some of the attitudes adopted by different species of males when\r\n    approaching their females. (After Peckham.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 123.--Courtship of Spiders. Continued from Fig.\r\n    122, similarly showing some of the attitudes of approach adopted by\r\n    males of yet other different species. (After Peckham.)]\r\n\r\nBut so great is the mass of material which Darwin has collected in proof\r\nof all the points mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, that to attempt\r\nanything in the way of an epitome would really be to damage its\r\nevidential force. Therefore I deem it best simply to refer to it as it\r\nstands in his _Descent of Man_, concluding, as he concludes,--\"This\r\nsurprising uniformity in the laws regulating the differences between the\r\nsexes in so many and such widely separated classes is intelligible if we\r\nadmit the action throughout all the higher divisions of the animal\r\nkingdom of one common cause, namely, sexual selection\"; while, as he\r\nmight well have added, it is difficult to imagine that all the large\r\nclasses of facts which an admission of this common cause serves to\r\nexplain, can ever admit of being rendered intelligible by any other\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nWe may next proceed to consider the objections which have been brought\r\nagainst the theory of sexual selection. And this is virtually the same\r\nthing as saying that we may now consider Mr. Wallace's views upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nReserving for subsequent consideration the most general of these\r\nobjections--namely, that at best the theory can only apply to the more\r\nintelligent animals, and so must necessarily fail to explain the\r\nphenomena of beauty in the less intelligent, or in the non-intelligent,\r\nas well as in all species of plants--we may take _seriatim_ the other\r\nobjections which, in the opinion of Mr. Wallace, are sufficient to\r\ndispose of the theory even as regards the higher animals.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he argues that the principal cause of the greater\r\nbrilliancy of male animals in general, and of male birds in particular,\r\nis that they do not so much stand in need of protection arising from\r\nconcealment as is the case with their respective females. Consequently\r\nnatural selection is not so active in repressing brilliancy of colour in\r\nthe males, or, which amounts to the same thing, is more active in\r\n\"repressing in the female those bright colours which are normally\r\nproduced in both sexes by general laws.\"\r\n\r\nNext, he argues that not only does natural selection thus exercise a\r\nnegative influence in passively permitting more heightened colour to\r\nappear in the males, but even exercises a positive influence in actively\r\npromoting its development in the males, while, at the same time,\r\nactively repressing its appearance in the females. For heightened\r\ncolour, he says, is correlated with health and vigour; and as there can\r\nbe no doubt that healthy and vigorous birds best provide for their\r\nyoung, natural selection, by always placing its premium on health and\r\nvigour in the males, thus also incidentally promotes, through correlated\r\ngrowth, their superior coloration.\r\n\r\nAgain, with regard to the display which is practised by male birds, and\r\nwhich constitutes the strongest of all Mr. Darwin's arguments in favour\r\nof sexual selection, Mr. Wallace points out that there is no evidence of\r\nthe females being in any way affected thereby. On the other hand, he\r\nargues that this display may be due merely to general excitement; and he\r\nlays stress upon the more special fact that moveable feathers are\r\nhabitually erected under the influence of anger and rivalry, in order to\r\nmake the bird look more formidable in the eyes of antagonists.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, he adduces the consideration that, even if the females are\r\nin any way affected by colour and its display on the part of the males,\r\nand if, therefore, sexual selection be conceded a true principle in\r\ntheory, still we must remember that, as a matter of fact, it can only\r\noperate in so far as it is allowed to operate by natural selection. Now,\r\naccording to Mr. Wallace, natural selection must wholly neutralize any\r\nsuch supposed influence of sexual selection. For, unless the survivors\r\nin the general struggle for existence happen to be those which are also\r\nthe most highly ornamented, natural selection must neutralize and\r\ndestroy any influence that may be exerted by female selection. But\r\nobviously the chances against the otherwise best fitted males happening\r\nto be likewise the most highly ornamented must be many to one, unless,\r\nas Wallace supposes, there is some correlation between embellishment and\r\ngeneral perfection, in which case, as he points out, the theory of\r\nsexual selection lapses altogether, and becomes but a special case of\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nOnce more, Mr. Wallace argues that the evidence collected by Mr. Darwin\r\nhimself proves that each bird finds a mate under any circumstances--a\r\ngeneral fact which in itself must quite neutralize any effect of sexual\r\nselection of colour or ornament, since the less highly coloured birds\r\nwould be at no disadvantage as regards the leaving of healthy progeny.\r\n\r\nLastly, he urges the high improbability that through thousands of\r\ngenerations all the females of any particular species--possibly spread\r\nover an enormous area--should uniformly and always have displayed\r\nexactly the same taste with respect to every detail of colour to be\r\npresented by the males.\r\n\r\nNow, without any question, we have here a most powerful array of\r\nobjections against the theory of sexual selection. Each of them is ably\r\ndeveloped by Mr. Wallace himself in his work on _Tropical Nature_; and\r\nalthough I have here space only to state them in the most abbreviated of\r\npossible forms, I think it will be apparent how formidable these\r\nobjections appear. Unfortunately the work in which they are mainly\r\npresented was published several years after the second edition of the\r\n_Descent of Man_, so that Mr. Darwin never had a suitable opportunity of\r\nreplying. But, if he had had such an opportunity, as far as I can judge\r\nit seems that his reply would have been more or less as follows.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Mr. Wallace fails to distinguish between brilliancy\r\nand ornamentation--or between colour as merely \"heightened,\" and as\r\ndistinctively decorative. Yet there is obviously the greatest possible\r\ndifference between these two things. We may readily enough admit that a\r\nmere heightening of already existing coloration is likely enough--at all\r\nevents in many cases--to accompany a general increase of vigour, and\r\ntherefore that natural selection, by promoting the latter, may also\r\nincidentally promote the former, in cases where brilliancy is not a\r\nsource of danger. But clearly this is a widely different thing from\r\nshowing that not only a _general brilliancy of colour_, but also _the\r\nparticular disposition of colours_, in the form of ornamental patterns,\r\ncan thus be accounted for by natural selection. Indeed, it is expressly\r\nin order to account for the occurrence of such ornamental patterns that\r\nMr. Darwin constructed his theory of sexual selection; and therefore, by\r\nthus virtually ignoring the only facts which that theory endeavours to\r\nexplain, Mr. Wallace is not really criticizing the theory at all. By\r\nrepresenting that the theory has to do only with brilliancy of colour,\r\nas distinguished from disposition of colours, he is going off upon a\r\nfalse issue which has never really been raised[48]. Look, for example,\r\nat a peacock's tail. No doubt it is sufficiently brilliant; but far more\r\nremarkable than its brilliancy is its elaborate pattern on the one hand,\r\nand its enormous size on the other. There is no conceivable reason why\r\nmere _brilliancy of colour_, as an accidental concomitant of general\r\nvigour, should have run into so extraordinary, so elaborate, and so\r\nbeautiful a _design of colours_. Moreover, this design is only unfolded\r\nwhen the tail is erected, and the tail is not erected in battle (as Mr.\r\nWallace's theory of the erectile function in feathers would require),\r\nbut in courtship; obviously, therefore, the purpose of the pattern, so\r\nto speak, is correlated with the act of courtship--it being only then,\r\nin fact, that the general purpose of the whole structure, as well as the\r\nmore special purpose of the pattern, becomes revealed. Lastly, the fact\r\nof this whole structure being so large, entailing not only a great\r\namount of physiological material in its production, but also of\r\nphysiological energy in carrying about such a weight, as well as of\r\nincreased danger from impeding locomotion and inviting capture--all this\r\nis obviously incompatible with the supposition of the peacock's tail\r\nhaving been produced by natural selection. And such a case does not\r\nstand alone. There are multitudes of other instances of ornamental\r\nstructures imposing a drain upon the vital energies of their possessors,\r\nwithout conferring any compensating benefit from a utilitarian point of\r\nview. Now, in all these cases, without any exception, such structures\r\nare ornamental structures which present a plain and obvious reference to\r\nthe relationship of the sexes. Therefore it becomes almost impossible to\r\ndoubt--first, that they exist for the sake of ornament; and next, that\r\nthe ornament exists on account of that relationship. If such structures\r\nwere due merely to a superabundance of energy, as Mr. Wallace supposes,\r\nnot only ought they to have been kept down by the economizing influence\r\nof natural selection; but we can see no reason, either why they should\r\nbe so highly ornamental on the one hand, or so exclusively related to\r\nthe sexual relationship on the other.\r\n\r\n    [48] Note C.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must take notice of the fact that where peculiar\r\n_structures_ are concerned for purposes of display in courtship, the\r\n_elaboration_ of these structures is often no less remarkable than that\r\nof patterns where colours are thus concerned. Take, for example, the\r\ncase of the Bell-bird, which I select from an innumerable number of\r\ninstances that might be mentioned because, while giving a verbal\r\ndescription of this animal, Darwin does not supply a pictorial\r\nrepresentation thereof. The bird, which lives in South America, has a\r\nvery loud and peculiar call, that can be heard at a distance of two or\r\nthree miles. The female is dusky-green; but the adult male is a\r\nbeautiful white, excepting the extraordinary structure with which we are\r\nat present concerned. This is a tube about three inches long, which\r\nrises from the base of the beak. It is jet black, and dotted over with\r\nsmall downy feathers. The tube is closed at the top, but its cavity\r\ncommunicates with the palate, and thus the whole admits of being\r\ninflated from within, when, of course, it stands erect as represented in\r\none of the two drawings. When not thus inflated, it hangs down, as\r\nshown in the second figure, which represents the plumage of a young\r\nmale. (Fig. 124.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 124.--The Bell-bird (_Chasmorhynchus niveus_,\r\n    1/4 natural size). Drawn from nature (_R. Coll. Surg. Mus._). In the\r\n    drawing of the adult male the ornamental appendage is represented in\r\n    its inflated condition, during courtship; in the drawing of the\r\n    young male it is shown in its flaccid condition.]\r\n\r\nIn another species of the genus there are three of these appendages--the\r\ntwo additional ones being mounted on the corners of the mouth. (Fig.\r\n125.) In all species of the genus (four in number) the tubes are\r\ninflated during courtship, and therefore perform the function of sexual\r\nembellishments. Now the point to which I wish to draw attention is, that\r\nso specialized and morphologically elaborate a structure cannot be\r\nregarded as merely adventitious. It must have been developed by some\r\ndefinite cause, acting through a long series of generations. And as no\r\nother function can be assigned to it than that of charming the female\r\nwhen it is erected in courtship, the peculiarity of form and mechanism\r\nwhich it presents--like the elaboration of patterns in cases where\r\ncolour only is concerned--virtually compels us to recognise in sexual\r\nselection the only conceivable cause of its production.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 125.--_C. tricarunculatus_, 1/4 natural size.\r\n    Copied from the _Ibis_. The ornamental appendages of the male are\r\n    represented in a partly inflated condition.]\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I think that Mr. Wallace's main objection falls to the\r\nground. Passing on to his subsidiary objections, I do not see much\r\nweight in his merely negative difficulty as to there being an absence of\r\nevidence upon hen birds being charmed by the plumage, or the voice, of\r\ntheir consorts. For, on the one hand, it is not very safe to infer what\r\nsentiments may be in the mind of a hen; and, on the other hand, it is\r\nimpossible to conceive what motive can be in the mind of a cock, other\r\nthan that of making himself attractive, when he performs his various\r\nantics, displays his ornamental plumes, or sings his melodious songs.\r\nConsiderations somewhat analogous apply to the difficulty of supposing\r\nso much similarity and constancy of taste on the part of female animals\r\nas Mr. Darwin's theory undoubtedly requires. Although we know very\r\nlittle about the psychology of the lower animals, we do observe in many\r\ncases that small details of mental organization are often wonderfully\r\nconstant and uniform throughout all members of a species, even where it\r\nis impossible to suggest any utility as a cause.\r\n\r\nAgain, as regards the objection that each bird finds a mate under any\r\ncircumstances, we have here an obvious begging of the whole question.\r\nThat every feathered Jack should find a feathered Jill is perhaps what\r\nwe might have antecedently expected; but when we meet with innumerable\r\ninstances of ornamental plumes, melodious songs, and the rest, as so\r\nmany witnesses to a process of sexual selection having always been in\r\noperation, it becomes irrational to exclude such evidence on account of\r\nour antecedent prepossessions.\r\n\r\nThere remains the objection that the principles of natural selection\r\nmust necessarily swallow up those of sexual selection. And this\r\nconsideration, I doubt not, lies at the root of all Mr. Wallace's\r\nopposition to the supplementary theory of sexual selection. He is\r\nself-consistent in refusing to entertain the evidence of sexual\r\nselection, on the ground of his antecedent persuasion that in the great\r\ndrama of evolution there is no possible standing-ground for any other\r\nactor than that which appears in the person of natural selection. But\r\nhere, again, we must refuse to allow any merely antecedent presumption\r\nto blind our eyes to the actual evidence of other agencies having\r\nco-operated with natural selection in producing the observed results.\r\nAnd, as regards the particular case now before us, I think I have shown,\r\nas far as space will permit, that in the phenomena of decorative\r\ncolouring (as distinguished from merely brilliant colouring), of\r\nmelodious song (as distinguished from merely tuneless cries), of\r\nenormous arborescent antlers (as distinguished from merely offensive\r\nweapons), and so forth--I say that in all these phenomena we have\r\nphenomena which cannot possibly be explained by the theory of natural\r\nselection; and, further, that if they are to be explained at all, this\r\ncan only be done, so far as we can at present see, by Mr. Darwin's\r\nsupplementary theory of sexual selection.\r\n\r\nI have now briefly answered all Mr. Wallace's objections to this\r\nsupplementary theory, and, as previously remarked, I feel pretty\r\nconfident that, at all events in the main, the answer is such as Mr.\r\nDarwin would himself have supplied, had there been a third edition of\r\nhis work upon the subject. At all events, be this as it may, we are\r\nhappily in possession of unquestionable evidence that he believed all\r\nMr. Wallace's objections to admit of fully satisfactory answers. For his\r\nvery last words to science--read only a few hours before his death at a\r\nmeeting of the Zoological Society--were:\r\n\r\n     I may perhaps be here permitted to say that, after having carefully\r\n     weighed, to the best of my ability, the various arguments which\r\n     have been advanced against the principle of sexual selection, I\r\n     remain firmly convinced of its truth[49].\r\n\r\n    [49] Since the above exposition of the theory of sexual selection\r\n    was written, Mr. Poulton has published his work on the _Colours of\r\n    Animals_. He there reproduces some of the illustrations which occur\r\n    in Mr. and Mrs. Peckham's work on _Sexual Selection in Spiders_, and\r\n    furnishes appropriate descriptions. Therefore, while retaining the\r\n    illustrations, I have withdrawn my own descriptions.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Poulton has also in his book supplied a _resume_ of the\r\n    arguments for and against the theory of sexual selection in general.\r\n    Of course in nearly all respects this corresponds with the _resume_\r\n    which is given in the foregoing pages; but I have left the latter as\r\n    it was originally written, because all the critical part is\r\n    reproduced _verbatim_ from a review of Mr. Wallace's _Darwinism_, of\r\n    a date still earlier than that of Mr. Poulton's book--viz.\r\n    _Contemporary Review_, August, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nI will now conclude this chapter, and with it the present volume, by\r\noffering a few general remarks on what may be termed the philosophical\r\nrelations of Darwinian doctrine to the facts of adaptation on the one\r\nhand, and to those of beauty on the other. Of course we are all aware\r\nthat before the days of this doctrine the facts of adaptation in organic\r\nnature were taken to constitute the clearest possible evidence of\r\nspecial design, on account of the wonderful mechanisms which they\r\neverywhere displayed; while the facts of beauty were taken as\r\nconstituting no less conclusive evidence of the quality of such special\r\ndesign as beneficent, not to say artistic. But now that the Darwinian\r\ndoctrine appears to have explained scientifically the former class of\r\nfacts by its theory of natural selection, and the latter class of facts\r\nby its theory of sexual selection, we may fitly conclude this brief\r\nexposition of the doctrine as a whole by considering what influence such\r\nnaturalistic explanations may fairly be taken to exercise upon the\r\nolder, or super-naturalistic, interpretations.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the facts of adaptation, we must first of all observe that\r\nthe Darwinian doctrine is immediately concerned with these facts only in\r\nso far as they occur in organic nature. With the adaptations--if they\r\ncan properly be so called--which occur in all the rest of nature, and\r\nwhich go to constitute the Cosmos as a whole so wondrous a spectacle of\r\nuniversal law and perfect order, this doctrine is but indirectly\r\nconcerned. Nevertheless, it is of course fundamentally concerned with\r\nthem to the extent that it seeks to bring the phenomena of organic\r\nnature into line with those of inorganic; and therefore to show that\r\nwhatever view we may severally take as to the kind of causation which is\r\nenergizing in the latter we must now extend to the former. This is\r\nusually expressed by saying that the theory of evolution by natural\r\nselection is a mechanical theory. It endeavours to comprise all the\r\nfacts of adaptation in organic nature under the same category of\r\nexplanation as those which occur in inorganic nature--that is to say,\r\nunder the category of physical, or ascertainable, causation. Indeed,\r\nunless the theory has succeeded in doing this, it has not succeeded in\r\ndoing anything--beyond making a great noise in the world. If Mr. Darwin\r\nhas not discovered a new mechanical cause in the selection principle,\r\nhis labour has been worse than in vain.\r\n\r\nNow, without unduly repeating what has already been said in Chapter\r\nVIII, I may remark that, whatever we may each think of the measure of\r\nsuccess which has thus far attended the theory of natural selection in\r\nexplaining the facts of adaptation, we ought all to agree that,\r\nconsidered as a matter of general reasoning, the theory does certainly\r\nrefer to a _vera causa_ of a strictly physical kind; and, therefore,\r\nthat no exception can be taken to the theory in this respect on grounds\r\nof _logic_. If the theory in this respect is to be attacked at all, it\r\ncan only be on grounds of _fact_--namely, by arguing that the cause does\r\nnot occur in nature, or that, if it does, its importance has been\r\nexaggerated by the theory. Even, however, if the latter proposition\r\nshould ever be proved, we may now be virtually certain that the only\r\nresult would be the relegation of all the residual phenomena of\r\nadaptation to other causes of the physical order--whether known or\r\nunknown. Hence, as far as the matter of _principle_ is concerned, we may\r\ndefinitely conclude that the great naturalistic movement of our century\r\nhas already brought all the phenomena of adaptation in organic nature\r\nunder precisely the same category of mechanical causation, as similar\r\nmovements in previous centuries have brought all the known phenomena of\r\ninorganic nature: the only question that remains for solution is the\r\nstrictly _scientific_ question touching the particular causes of the\r\nmechanical order which have been at work.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the phenomena of adaptation. Turning next to those of\r\nbeauty, we have already seen that the theory of sexual selection stands\r\nto these in precisely the same relation as the theory of natural\r\nselection does to those of adaptation. In other words, it supplies a\r\nphysical explanation of them; because, as far as our present purposes\r\nare concerned, it may be taken for granted, or for the sake of argument,\r\nthat inasmuch as psychological elements enter into the question the\r\ncerebral basis which they demand involves a physical side.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, this further point of resemblance between the two\r\ntheories: neither of them has any reference to inorganic nature.\r\nTherefore, with the charm or the loveliness of landscapes, of earth and\r\nsea and sky, of pebbles, crystals, and so forth, we have at present\r\nnothing to do. How it is that so many inanimate objects are invested\r\nwith beauty--why it is that beauty attaches to architecture, music,\r\npoetry, and many other things--these are questions which do not\r\nspecially concern the biologist. If they are ever to receive any\r\nsatisfactory explanation in terms of natural causation, this must be\r\nfurnished at the hands of the psychologist. It may be possible for him\r\nto show, more satisfactorily than hitherto, that all beauty, whenever\r\nand wherever it occurs, is literally \"in the eyes of the beholder\"; or\r\nthat objectively considered, there is no such thing as beauty. It may\r\nbe--and in my opinion it probably is--purely an affair of the percipient\r\nmind itself, depending on the association of ideas with pleasure-giving\r\nobjects. This association may well lead to a liking for such objects,\r\nand so to the formation of what is known as aesthetic feeling with regard\r\nto them. Moreover, beauty of inanimate nature must be an affair of the\r\npercipient mind itself, unless there be a creating intelligence with\r\norgans of sense and ideals of beauty similar to our own. And, apart from\r\nany deeper considerations, this latter possibility is scarcely entitled\r\nto be regarded as a probability, looking to the immense diversities in\r\nthose ideals among different races of mankind. But, be this as it may,\r\nthe scientific problem which is presented by the fact of aesthetic\r\nfeeling, even if it is ever to be satisfactorily solved, is a problem\r\nwhich, as already remarked, must be dealt with by psychologists. As\r\nbiologists we have simply to accept this feeling as a fact, and to\r\nconsider how, out of such a feeling as a cause, the beauty of organic\r\nnature may have followed as an effect.\r\n\r\nNow we have already seen how the theory of sexual selection supposes\r\nthis to have happened. But against this theory a formidable objection\r\narises, and one which I have thought it best to reserve for treatment in\r\nthis place, because it serves to show the principal difference between\r\nMr. Darwin's two great generalizations, considered as generalizations in\r\nthe way of mechanical theory. For while the theory of natural selection\r\nextends equally throughout the whole range of organic nature, the theory\r\nof sexual selection has but a comparatively restricted scope, which,\r\nmoreover, is but vaguely defined. For it is obvious that the theory can\r\nonly apply to living organisms which are sufficiently intelligent to\r\nadmit of our reasonably accrediting them with aesthetic taste--namely, in\r\neffect, the higher animals. And just as this consideration greatly\r\nrestricts the possible scope of the theory, as compared with that of\r\nnatural selection, so does it render undefined the zoological limits\r\nwithin which it can be reasonably employed. Lastly, this necessarily\r\nundefined, and yet most important limitation exposes the theory to the\r\nobjection just alluded to, and which I shall now mention.\r\n\r\nThe theory, as we have just seen, is necessarily restricted in its\r\napplication to the higher animals. Yet the facts which it is designed to\r\nexplain are not thus restricted. For beauty is by no means restricted to\r\nthe higher animals. The whole of the vegetable world, and the whole of\r\nthe animal world at least as high up in the scale as the insects, must\r\nbe taken as incapable of aesthetic feeling. Therefore, the extreme\r\nbeauty of flowers, sea-anemones, corals, and so forth, cannot possibly\r\nbe ascribed to sexual selection.\r\n\r\nNow, with regard to this difficulty, we must begin by excluding the case\r\nof the vegetable kingdom as irrelevant. For it has been rendered highly\r\nprobable--if not actually proved--by Darwin and others, that the beauty\r\nof flowers and of fruits is in large part due to natural selection. It\r\nis to the advantage of flowering plants that their organs of\r\nfructification should be rendered conspicuous--and in many cases also\r\nodoriferous,--in order to attract the insects on which the process of\r\nfertilization depends. Similarly, it is to the advantage of all plants\r\nwhich have brightly coloured fruits that these should be conspicuous for\r\nthe purpose of attracting birds, which eat the fruits and so disseminate\r\nthe seed. Hence all the gay colours and varied forms, both of flowers\r\nand fruits, have been thus adequately explained as due to natural\r\ncauses, working for the welfare, as distinguished from the beauty, of\r\nthe plants. For even the distribution of colours on flowers, or the\r\nbeautiful patterns which so many of them present, are found to be useful\r\nin guiding insects to the organs of fructification.\r\n\r\nAgain, the green colouring of leaves, which lends so much beauty to the\r\nvegetable world, has likewise been shown to be of vital importance to\r\nthe physiology of plant-life; and, therefore, may also be ascribed to\r\nnatural selection. Thus, there remains only the forms of plants other\r\nthan the flowers. But the forms of leaves have also in many cases been\r\nshown to be governed by principles of utility; and the same is to be\r\nsaid of the branching structure which is so characteristic of trees and\r\nshrubs, since this is the form most effectual for spreading out the\r\nleaves to the light and air. Here, then, we likewise find that the cause\r\ndetermining plant beauty is natural selection; and so we may conclude\r\nthat the only reason why the forms of trees which are thus determined by\r\nutility appeal to us as beautiful, is because we are accustomed to these\r\nthe most ordinary forms. Our ideas having been always, as it were,\r\nmoulded upon these forms, aesthetic feeling becomes attached to them by\r\nthe principle of association. At any rate, it is certain that when we\r\ncontemplate almost any forms of plant-structure which, for special\r\nreasons of utility, differ widely from these (to us) more habitual\r\nforms, the result is not suggestive of beauty. Many of the tropical and\r\nun-tree-like plants--such as the cactus tribe--strike us as odd and\r\nquaint, not as beautiful. Be this however as it may, I trust I have said\r\nenough to prove that in the vegetable world, at all events, the\r\nattainment of beauty cannot be held to have been an object aimed at, so\r\nto speak, for its own sake. Even if, for the purposes of argument, we\r\nwere to suppose that all the forms and colours in the vegetable world\r\nare due to special design, there could be no doubt that the purpose of\r\nthis design has been in chief part a utilitarian purpose; it has not\r\naimed at beauty exclusively for its own sake. For most of such beauty as\r\nwe here perceive is plainly due to the means adopted for the attainment\r\nof life-preserving ends, which, of course, is a metaphorical way of\r\nsaying that it is probably due to natural selection[50].\r\n\r\n    [50] The beauty of autumnal tints in fading leaves may possibly be\r\n    adduced _per contra_. But here we have to remember that it is only\r\n    some kinds of leaves which thus become beautiful when fading, while,\r\n    even as regards those that do, it is not remarkable that their\r\n    chlorophyll should, as it were, accidentally assume brilliant tints\r\n    while breaking down into lower grades of chemical constitution. The\r\n    case, in fact, is exactly parallel to those in the animal kingdom\r\n    which are considered in the ensuing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTurning, then, to the animal kingdom below the level of insects, here we\r\nare bound to confess that the beauty which so often meets us cannot\r\nreasonably be ascribed either to natural or to sexual selection. Not to\r\nsexual selection for the reasons already given; the animals in question\r\nare neither sufficiently intelligent to possess any aesthetic taste, nor,\r\nas a matter of fact, do we observe that they exercise any choice in\r\npairing. Not to natural selection, because we cannot here, as in the\r\ncase of vegetables, point to any benefit as generally arising from\r\nbright colours and beautiful forms. On the principles of naturalism,\r\ntherefore, we are driven to conclude that the beauty here is purely\r\nadventitious, or accidental. Nor need we be afraid to make this\r\nadmission, if only we take a sufficiently wide view of the facts. For,\r\nwhen we do take such a view, we find that beauty here is by no means of\r\ninvariable, or even of general, occurrence. There is no loveliness about\r\nan oyster or a lob-worm; parasites, as a rule, are positively ugly, and\r\nthey constitute a good half of all animal species. The truth seems to\r\nbe, when we look attentively at the matter, that in all cases where\r\nbeauty does occur in these lower forms of animal life, its presence is\r\nowing to one of two things--either to the radiate form, or to the bright\r\ntints. Now, seeing that the radiate form is of such general occurrence\r\namong these lower animals--appearing over and over again, with the\r\nutmost insistence, even among groups widely separated from one another\r\nby the latest results of scientific classification--seeing this, it\r\nbecomes impossible to doubt that the radiate form is due to some\r\nmorphological reasons of wide generality. Whether these reasons be\r\nconnected with the internal laws of growth, or to the external\r\nconditions of environment, I do not pretend to suggest. But I feel safe\r\nin saying that it cannot possibly be due to any design to secure beauty\r\nfor its own sake. The very generality of the radiate form is in itself\r\nenough to suggest that it must have some physical, as distinguished from\r\nan aesthetic, explanation; for, if the attainment of beauty had here been\r\nthe object, surely it might have been even more effectually accomplished\r\nby adopting a greater variety of typical forms--as, for instance, in the\r\ncase of flowers.\r\n\r\nComing then, lastly, to the case of brilliant tints in the lower\r\nanimals, Mr. Darwin has soundly argued that there is nothing forced or\r\nimprobable in the supposition that organic compounds, presenting as they\r\ndo such highly complex and such varied chemical constitutions, should\r\noften present brilliant colouring _incidentally_. Considered merely as\r\ncolouring, there is nothing in the world more magnificent than arterial\r\nblood; yet here the colouring is of purely utilitarian significance. It\r\nis of the first importance in the chemistry of respiration; but is\r\nsurely without any meaning from an aesthetic point of view. For the\r\ncolour of the cheeks, and of the flesh generally, in the _white_ races\r\nof mankind, could have been produced quite as effectually by the use of\r\npigment--as in the case of certain monkeys. Now the fact that in the\r\ncase of blood, as in that of many other highly coloured fluids and\r\nsolids throughout the animal kingdom, the colour is _concealed_, is\r\nsurely sufficient proof that the colour, if regarded from an aesthetic\r\npoint of view, is accidental. Therefore, when, as in other cases, such\r\ncolouring occurs upon the surface, and thus becomes apparent, are we not\r\nirresistibly led to conclude that its _exhibition_ in such cases is\r\nlikewise accidental, so far as any question of aesthetic design is\r\nconcerned?\r\n\r\nI have now briefly glanced at all the main facts of organic nature with\r\nreference to beauty; and, as a result, I think it is impossible to\r\nresist the general conclusion, that in organic nature beauty does not\r\nexist as an end _per se_. All cases where beauty can be pointed to in\r\norganic nature are seemingly due--either to natural selection, acting\r\nwithout reference to beauty, but to utility; to sexual selection, acting\r\nwith reference to the taste of animals; or else to sheer accident. And\r\nif this general conclusion should be held to need any special\r\nverification, is it not to be found in the numberless cases where\r\norganic nature not only fails to be beautiful, but reveals itself as the\r\nreverse. Not again to refer to the case of parasites, what can be more\r\nunshapely than a hippopotamus, or more generally repulsive than a\r\ncrocodile? If it be said that these are exceptions, and that the forms\r\nof animals as a rule are graceful, the answer--even apart from\r\nparasites--is obvious. In all cases where the habits of life are such as\r\nto render rapid locomotion a matter of utilitarian necessity, the\r\noutlines of an animal _must_ be graceful--else, whether the locomotion\r\nbe terrestrial, aerial, or aquatic, it must fail to be swift. Hence it\r\nis only in such cases as that of the hippopotamus, rhinoceros,\r\nelephant, crocodile, and so forth, where natural selection has had no\r\nconcern in developing speed, that the accompanying accident of\r\ngracefulness can be allowed to disappear. But if beauty in organic\r\nnature had been in itself what may be termed an artistic object on the\r\npart of a divine Creator, it is absurd to suggest that his design in\r\nthis matter should only have been allowed to appear where we are able to\r\ndetect other and very good reasons for its appearance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, whether we look to the facts of adaptation or to those of beauty,\r\neverywhere throughout organic nature we meet with abundant evidence of\r\nnatural causation, while nowhere do we meet with any independent\r\nevidence of supernatural design. But, having led up to this conclusion,\r\nand having thus stated it as honestly as I can, I should like to finish\r\nby further stating what, in my opinion is its logical bearing upon the\r\nmore fundamental tenets of religious thought.\r\n\r\nAs I have already observed at the commencement of this brief exposition,\r\nprior to the Darwinian theory of organic evolution, the theologian was\r\nprone to point to the realm of organic nature as furnishing a peculiarly\r\nrich and virtually endless store of facts, all combining in their\r\ntestimony to the wisdom and the beneficence of the Deity. Innumerable\r\nadaptations of structures to functions appeared to yield convincing\r\nevidence in favour of design; the beauty so profusely shed by living\r\nforms appeared to yield evidence, no less convincing, of that design as\r\nbeneficent. But both these sources of evidence have now, as it were,\r\nbeen tapped at their fountain-head: the adaptation and the beauty are\r\nalike receiving their explanation at the hands of a purely mechanical\r\nphilosophy. Nay, even the personality of man himself is assailed; and\r\nthis not only in the features which he shares with the lower animals,\r\nbut also in his god-like attributes of reason, thought, and conscience.\r\nAll nature has thus been transformed before the view of the present\r\ngeneration in a manner and to an extent that has never before been\r\npossible: and inasmuch as the change which has taken place has taken\r\nplace in the direction of naturalism, and this to the extent of\r\nrendering the mechanical interpretation of nature universal, it is no\r\nwonder if the religious mind has suddenly awakened to a new and a\r\nterrible force in the words of its traditional enemy--Where is now thy\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the bearings of science on\r\nreligion[51]; but I think it is a place where one may properly point out\r\nthe limits within which no such bearings obtain. Now, from what has just\r\nbeen said, it will be apparent that I am not going to minimise the\r\nchange which has been wrought. On the contrary, I believe it is only\r\nstupidity or affectation which can deny that the change in question is\r\nmore deep and broad than any single previous change in the whole history\r\nof human thought. It is a fundamental, a cosmical, a world-transforming\r\nchange. Nevertheless, in my opinion, it is a change of a non-theistic,\r\nas distinguished from an a-theistic, kind. It has rendered impossible\r\nthe appearance in literature of any future Paley, Bell, or Chalmers; but\r\nit has done nothing in the way of negativing that belief in a Supreme\r\nBeing which it was the object of these authors to substantiate. If it\r\nhas demonstrated the futility of their proof, it has furnished nothing\r\nin the way of disproof. It has shown, indeed, that their line of\r\nargument was misjudged when they thus sought to separate organic nature\r\nfrom inorganic as a theatre for the special or peculiar display of\r\nsupernatural design; but further than this it has not shown anything.\r\nThe change in question therefore, although greater in degree, is the\r\nsame in kind as all its predecessors: like all previous advances in\r\ncosmological theory which have been wrought by the advance of science,\r\nthis latest and greatest advance has been that of revealing the\r\nconstitution of nature, or the method of causation, as everywhere the\r\nsame. But it is evident that this change, vast and to all appearance\r\nfinal though it be, must end within the limits of natural causation\r\nitself. The whole world of life and mind may now have been annexed to\r\nthat of matter and energy as together constituting one magnificent\r\ndominion, which is everywhere subject to the same rule, or method of\r\ngovernment. But the ulterior and ultimate question touching the nature\r\nof this government as mental or non-mental, personal or impersonal,\r\nremains exactly where it was. Indeed, this is a question which cannot be\r\naffected by _any_ advance of science, further than science has proved\r\nherself able to dispose of erroneous arguments based upon ignorance of\r\nnature. For while the sphere of science is necessarily restricted to\r\nthat of natural causation which it is her office to explore, the\r\nquestion touching the _nature of this natural causation_ is one which as\r\nnecessarily lies without the whole sphere of such causation itself:\r\ntherefore it lies beyond any possible intrusion by science. And not only\r\nso. But if the nature of natural causation be that of the highest order\r\nof known existence, then, although we must evidently be incapable of\r\nconceiving what such a Mind is, at least we seem capable of judging what\r\nin many respects it is not. It cannot be more than one; it cannot be\r\nlimited either in space or time; it cannot be other than at least as\r\nself-consistent as its manifestations in nature are invariable. Now,\r\nfrom the latter deduction there arises a point of first-rate importance\r\nin the present connexion. For if the so-called First Cause be\r\nintelligent, and therefore all secondary causes but the expression of a\r\nsupreme Will, in as far as such a Will is self-consistent, the operation\r\nof all natural causes must be uniform,--with the result that, as seen by\r\nus, this operation must needs appear to be what we call mechanical. The\r\nmore unvarying the Will, the more unvarying must be this expression\r\nthereof; so that, if the former be absolutely self-consistent, the\r\nlatter cannot fail to be as reasonably interpreted by the theory of\r\nmindless necessity, as by that of ubiquitous intention. Such being, as\r\nit appears to me, the pure logic of the matter, the proof of organic\r\nevolution amounts to nothing more than the proof of a natural process.\r\nWhat mode of being is ultimately concerned in this process--or in what\r\nit is that this process ultimately consists--is a question upon which\r\nscience is as voiceless as speculation is vociferous.\r\n\r\n    [51] The best treatise on this subject is Prof. Le Conte's\r\n    _Evolution and its Relation to Religious Thought_ (Appleton & Co.\r\n    1888).\r\n\r\nBut, it may still be urged, surely the principle of natural selection\r\n(with its terrible basis in the struggle for existence) and the\r\nprinciple of sexual selection (with its consequence in denying beauty\r\nto be an end in itself) demonstrate that, _if_ there be design in\r\nnature, such design at all events cannot be beneficent. To this,\r\nhowever, I should again reply that, just as touching the major question\r\nof design itself, so as touching this minor question of the quality of\r\nsuch design as beneficent, I do not see how the matter has been much\r\naffected by a discovery of the principles before us. For we did not need\r\na Darwin to tell us that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth\r\ntogether in pain. The most that in this connexion Darwin can fairly be\r\nsaid to have done is to have estimated in a more careful and precise\r\nmanner than any of his predecessors, the range and the severity of this\r\ntravail. And if it be true that the result of what may be called his\r\nscientific analysis of nature in respect of suffering is to have shown\r\nthe law of suffering even more severe, more ubiquitous, and more\r\nnecessary than it had ever been shown before, we must remember at the\r\nsame time how he has proved, more rigidly than was ever proved before,\r\nthat suffering is a condition to improvement--struggle for life being\r\nthe _raison d'etre_ of higher life, and this not only in the physical\r\nsphere, but also in the mental and moral.\r\n\r\nLastly, if it be said that the _choice_ of such a method, whereby\r\nimprovement is only secured at the cost of suffering, indicates a kind\r\nof callousness on the part of an intelligent Being supposed to be\r\nomnipotent, I confess that such does appear to me a legitimate\r\nconclusion--subject, however, to the reservation that higher knowledge\r\nmight displace it. For, as far as matters are now actually presented to\r\nthe unbiased contemplation of a human mind, this provisional inference\r\nappears to me unavoidable--namely, that if the world of sentient life be\r\ndue to an Omnipotent Designer, the aim or motive of the design must have\r\nbeen that of securing a continuous advance of animal improvement,\r\nwithout any regard at all to animal suffering. For I own it does not\r\nseem to me compatible with a fair and honest exercise of our reason to\r\nset the sum of animal happiness over against the sum of animal misery,\r\nand then to allege that, in so far as the former tends to balance--or to\r\nover-balance--the latter, thus far is the moral character of the design\r\nas a whole vindicated. Even if it could be shown that the sum of\r\nhappiness in the brute creation considerably preponderates over that of\r\nunhappiness--which is the customary argument of theistic apologists,--we\r\nshould still remain without evidence as to this state of matters having\r\nformed any essential part of the design. On the other hand, we should\r\nstill be in possession of seemingly good evidence to the contrary. For\r\nit is clearly a condition to progress by survival of the fittest, that\r\nas soon as organisms become sentient selection must be exercised with\r\nreference to sentiency; and this means that, if further progress is to\r\ntake place, states of sentiency _must_ become so organized with\r\nreference to habitual experience of the race, that pleasures and pains\r\nshall answer respectively to states of agreement and disagreement with\r\nthe sentient creature's environment. Those animals which found pleasure\r\nin what was deleterious to life would not survive, while those which\r\nfound pleasure in what was beneficial to life would survive; and so\r\neventually, in every species of animal, states of sentiency as agreeable\r\nor disagreeable must approximately correspond with what is good for the\r\nspecies or bad for the species. Indeed, we may legitimately surmise that\r\nthe reason why sentiency (and, _a fortiori_, conscious volition) has\r\never appeared upon the scene at all, has been because it\r\nfurnishes--through this continuously selected adjustment of states of\r\nsentiency to states of the sentient organism--so admirable a means of\r\nsecuring rapid, and often refined, adjustments by the organism to the\r\nhabitual conditions of its life[52]. But, if so, not only is this state\r\nof matters a _condition_ to progress in the future; it is further, and\r\nequally, a _consequence_ of progress in the past.\r\n\r\n    [52] See _Mental Evolution in Animals_, pp. 110-111.\r\n\r\nHowever, be this as it may, from all that has gone before does it not\r\nbecome apparent that pleasure or happiness on the one hand, and pain or\r\nmisery on the other, must be present in sentient nature? And so long as\r\nthey are both seen to be equally necessary under the process of\r\nevolution by natural selection, we have clearly no more reason to regard\r\nthe pleasure than the pain as an object of the supposed design. Rather\r\nmust we see in both one and the same condition to progress under the\r\nmethod of natural causation which is before us; and therefore I cannot\r\nperceive that it makes much difference--so far as the argument for\r\nbeneficence is concerned--whether the pleasures of animals outweigh\r\ntheir pains, or _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, then, it seems to me that such evidence as we have is\r\nagainst rather than in favour of the inference, that if design be\r\noperative in animate nature it has reference to animal enjoyment or\r\nwell-being, as distinguished from animal improvement or evolution. And\r\nif this result should be found distasteful to the religious mind--if it\r\nbe felt that there is no desire to save the evidences of design unless\r\nthey serve at the same time to testify to the nature of that design as\r\nbeneficent,--I must once more observe that the difficulty thus presented\r\nto theism is not a difficulty of modern creation. On the contrary, it\r\nhas always constituted the fundamental difficulty with which natural\r\ntheologians have had to contend. The external world appears, in this\r\nrespect, to be at variance with our moral sense; and when the antagonism\r\nis brought home to the religious mind, it must ever be with a shock of\r\nterrified surprise. It has been newly brought home to us by the\r\ngeneralizations of Darwin; and therefore, as I said at the beginning,\r\nthe religious thought of our generation has been more than ever\r\nstaggered by the question--Where is now thy God? But I have endeavoured\r\nto show that the logical standing of the case has not been materially\r\nchanged; and when this cry of Reason pierces the heart of Faith, it\r\nremains for Faith to answer now, as she has always answered before--and\r\nanswered with that trust which is at once her beauty and her\r\nlife--Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_APPENDIX AND NOTES_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nON OBJECTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE THEORY OF ORGANIC\r\nEVOLUTION ON GROUNDS OF PALAEONTOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile stating in the text, and in a necessarily general way, the\r\nevidence which is yielded by palaeontology to the theory of organic\r\nevolution, I have been desirous of not overstating it. Therefore, in the\r\nearlier paragraphs of the chapter, which deal with the most general\r\nheads of such evidence, I introduced certain qualifying phrases; and I\r\nwill now give the reasons which led me to do so.\r\n\r\nOf all the five biological sciences which have been called into\r\nevidence--viz. those of Classification, Morphology, Embryology,\r\nPalaeontology, and Geographical Distribution--it is in the case of\r\npalaeontology alone that any important or professional opinions still\r\ncontinue to be unsatisfied. Therefore, in order that justice may be done\r\nto this line of dissent, I have thought it better to deal with the\r\nmatter in a separate Appendix, rather than to hurry it over in the text.\r\nAnd, as all the difficulties or objections which have been advanced\r\nagainst the theory of evolution on grounds of palaeontology must vary, as\r\nto their strength, with the estimate which is taken touching the degree\r\nof imperfection of the geological record, I will begin by adding a few\r\nparagraphs to what has already been said in the text upon this subject.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as to the difficulties in the way of fossils being formed\r\nat all. We have already noticed in the text that it is only the more or\r\nless hard parts of organisms which under any circumstances can be\r\nfossilized; and even the hardest parts quickly disintegrate if not\r\nprotected from the weather on land, or from the water on the sea-bottom.\r\nMoreover, as Darwin says, \"we probably take a quite erroneous view when\r\nwe assume that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of\r\nthe sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil\r\nremains. Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the\r\nbright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on\r\nrecord of a formation conformably covered, after an immense interval of\r\ntime, by another and a later formation, without the underlying bed\r\nhaving suffered in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only\r\non the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an\r\nunaltered condition.\" Next, as regards littoral animals, he shows the\r\ndifficulty which they must have in becoming fossils, and gives a\r\nstriking example in several of the existing species of a sub-family of\r\ncirripedes (_Chthamalinae_), \"which coat the rocks all over the world in\r\ninfinite numbers,\" yet, with the exception of one species which inhabits\r\ndeep water, no vestige of any of them has been found in any tertiary\r\nformation, although it is known that the genus _Chthamalus_ existed\r\nthrough the Chalk period. Lastly, \"with respect to the terrestrial\r\nproductions which lived through the secondary and palaeozoic periods, it\r\nis superfluous to state our evidence is fragmentary in an extreme\r\ndegree. For instance, until recently not a land shell was known\r\nbelonging to either of these vast periods,\" with one exception; while,\r\n\"in regard to mammiferous remains, a glance at the historical table in\r\nLyell's Manual will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare has\r\nbeen their preservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their\r\nrarity surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones\r\nof tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in\r\nlacustrine deposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known\r\nbelonging to the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps of even more importance than all these known causes which\r\nprevent the formation of fossils, is the existence of unknown causes\r\nwhich make for the same result. For example, the Flysch-formation is a\r\nformation of several thousand feet in thickness (as much as 6000 in some\r\nplaces), and it extends for at least 300 miles from Vienna to\r\nSwitzerland; moreover, it consists of shale and sandstone. Therefore,\r\nalike in respect of time, space, and character, it is just such a\r\nformation as we should expect to find highly rich in fossils; yet,\r\n\"although this great mass has been most carefully searched, no fossils,\r\nexcept a few vegetable remains, have been found.\"\r\n\r\nSo much then for the difficulty, so to speak, which nature experiences\r\nin the manufacture of fossils. Probably not one per cent. of the species\r\nof animals which have inhabited the earth has left a single individual\r\nas a fossil, whereby to record its past existence.\r\n\r\nBut of even more importance than this difficulty of making fossils in\r\nthe first instance, is the difficulty of preserving them when they are\r\nmade. The vast majority of fossils have been formed under water, and a\r\nlarge proportional number of these--whether the animals were marine,\r\nterrestrial, or inhabitants of fresh water--have been formed in\r\nsedimentary deposits either of sand, gravel, or other porous material.\r\nNow, where such deposits have been afterwards raised into the air for\r\nany considerable time--and this has been more or less the case with all\r\ndeposits which are available for exploration--their fossiliferous\r\ncontents will have been, as a general rule, dissolved by the percolation\r\nof rain-water charged with carbonic acid. Similarly, sea-water has\r\nrecently been found to be a surprisingly strong solvent of calcareous\r\nmaterial: hence, Saturn-like, the ocean devours her own progeny as far\r\nas shells and bones of all kinds are concerned--and this to an extent of\r\nwhich we have probably no adequate conception.\r\n\r\nOf still greater destructive influence, however, than these solvent\r\nagencies in earth and sea, are the erosive agencies of both. Any one who\r\nwatches the pounding of the waves upon the shore; who then observes the\r\neffect of it upon the rocks broken into shingle, and on the shingle\r\nreduced to sand; who, looking behind him at the cliffs, sees there the\r\nevidence of the gradual advance of this all-pulverising power--an\r\nadvance so gradual that no yard of it is accomplished until within that\r\nyard the \"white teeth\" have eaten well into the \"bowels of the earth\";\r\nwho then reflects that this process is going on simultaneously over\r\nhundreds of thousands of miles of coast-lines throughout the world; and\r\nwho finally extends his mental vision from space to time, by trying\r\ndimly to imagine what this ever-roaring monster must have consumed\r\nduring the hundreds of millions of years that slowly rising and slowly\r\nsinking continents have exposed their whole areas to her jaws; whoever\r\nthus observes and thus reflects must be a dull man, if he does not begin\r\nto feel that in the presence of such a destroyer as this we have no\r\nreason to wonder at a frequent silence in the testimony of the rocks.\r\n\r\nBut although the erosive agency of the sea is thus so inconceivably\r\ngreat, it is positively small if compared with erosive agencies on land.\r\nThe constant action of rain, wind, and running water, in wearing down\r\nthe surfaces of all lands into \"the dust of continents to be\"; the\r\ndisintegrating effects on all but the very hardest rocks of winter\r\nfrosts alternating with summer heats; the grinding power of ice in\r\nperiods of glaciation; and last, but not least, the wholesale melting up\r\nof sedimentary formations whenever these have sunk for any considerable\r\ndistance beneath the earth's surface:--all these agencies taken together\r\nconstitute so prodigious a sum of energies combined through\r\nimmeasureable ages in their common work of destruction, that when we\r\ntry to realise what it must amount to, we can scarcely fail to wonder,\r\nnot that the geological record is highly imperfect, but that so much of\r\nthe record has survived as we find to have been the case. And, if we add\r\nto these erosive and solvent agencies on land the erosive and solvent\r\nagencies of the sea, we may almost begin to wonder that anything\r\ndeserving the name of a geological record is in existence at all.\r\n\r\nThat such estimates of the destructive powers of nature are not mere\r\nmatters of speculative reasoning may be amply shown by stating one\r\nsingle fact, which, like so many others where the present subject is\r\nconcerned, we owe to the generalizations of Darwin. Plutonic rocks,\r\nbeing those which have emerged from subterranean heat of melting\r\nintensity, must clearly at some time or another have lain beneath the\r\nwhole thickness of sedimentary deposits, which at that time occupied any\r\npart of the earth's surface where we now find the Plutonic rocks exposed\r\nto view. Or, in other words, wherever we now find Plutonic rocks at the\r\nsurface of the earth, we must conclude that all the sedimentary rocks by\r\nwhich they were covered when in a molten state have since been entirely\r\ndestroyed; several vertical miles of the only kinds of rocks in which\r\nfossils can possibly occur must in all such cases have been abolished\r\n_in toto_. Now, in many parts of the world metamorphic rocks--which have\r\nthus gradually risen from Plutonic depths, while miles of various other\r\nrock-formations have been removed from their now exposed surfaces--cover\r\nimmense areas, and therefore testify by their present horizontal range,\r\nno less than by their previously vertical depth, to the enormous scale\r\non which a total destruction has taken place of everything that once lay\r\nabove them. For instance, the granitic region of Parime is at least\r\nnineteen times the size of Switzerland; a similar region south of the\r\nAmazon is probably larger than France, Spain, Italy, and Great Britain\r\nall put together; and, more remarkable still, over the area of the\r\nUnited States and Canada, granitic rocks exceed in the proportion of 19\r\nto 12-1/2 the whole of the newer Palaeozoic formations. Lastly, after\r\ngiving these examples, Darwin adds the important consideration, that \"in\r\nmany regions the metamorphic and granitic rocks would be found much more\r\nwidely extended than they appear to be, if all the sedimentary beds were\r\nremoved which rest unconformably on them, and which could not have\r\nformed part of the original mantle under which they were crystallized.\"\r\n\r\nThe above is a brief condensation of the already condensed statement\r\nwhich Darwin has given of the imperfection of the geological record; but\r\nI think it is enough to show, in a general way, how precarious must be\r\nthe nature of any objections to the theory of evolution which are\r\nfounded merely upon the silence of palaeontology in cases where, if the\r\nrecord were anything like complete, we should be entitled to expect from\r\nit some positive information. But, as we have seen in the text,\r\nimperfect though the record be, in as far as it furnishes positive\r\ninformation at all, this is well-nigh uniformly in favour of the theory;\r\nand therefore, even on grounds of palaeontology alone, it appears to me\r\nthat Darwin is much too liberal where he concludes his discussion by\r\nsaying,--\"Those who believe that the geological record is in any degree\r\nperfect, will undoubtedly at once reject the theory.\" If in any measure\r\nreasonable, such persons ought rather to examine their title to such a\r\nbelief; and even if they disregard the consensus of testimony which is\r\nyielded by all the biological sciences to the theory of evolution, they\r\nought at least to hold their judgment in suspense until they shall have\r\nnot only set against the apparently negative testimony which is yielded\r\nby geology its unquestionably positive testimony, but also well\r\nconsidered the causes which may--or rather must--have so gravely\r\nimpaired the geological record.\r\n\r\nHowever, be this as it may, I will now pass on to consider the\r\ndifficulties and objections which have been brought against the theory\r\non grounds of palaeontology.\r\n\r\nThese may be classified under four heads. First, the absence of varietal\r\nlinks between allied species; second, the sudden appearance of whole\r\ngroups of species--not only as genera and families, but even sometimes\r\nas orders and classes--without any forms leading up to them; third, the\r\noccurrence of highly organized types at much lower levels of geological\r\nstrata than an evolutionist would antecedently expect; and, fourth, the\r\nabsence of fossils of any kind lower down than the Cambrian strata.\r\n\r\nNow all these objections depend on estimates of the imperfection of the\r\ngeological record much lower than that which is formed by Darwin.\r\nTherefore I have arranged the objections in their order of difficulty in\r\nthis respect, or in the order that requires successively increasing\r\nestimates of the imperfection of the record, if they are to be\r\nsuccessively answered.\r\n\r\nI think that the first of them has been already answered in the text, by\r\nshowing that even a very moderate estimate of the imperfection of the\r\nrecord is enough to explain why intermediate _varieties_, connecting\r\nallied _species_, are but comparatively seldom met with. Moreover it was\r\nshown that in some cases, where shells are concerned, remarkably\r\nwell-connected series of such varieties have been met with. And the same\r\napplies to species and genera in certain other cases, as in the equine\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nBut no doubt a greater difficulty arises where whole groups of species\r\nand genera, or even families and orders, appear to arise suddenly,\r\nwithout anything leading up to them. Even this the second difficulty,\r\nhowever, admits of being fully met, when we remember that in very many\r\ncases it has been proved, quite apart from the theory of descent, that\r\nsuperjacent formations have been separated from one another by wide\r\nintervals of time. And even although it often happens that intermediate\r\ndeposits which are absent in one part of the world are present in\r\nanother, we have no right to assume that such is always the case.\r\nBesides, even if it were, we should have no right further to assume that\r\nthe faunas of widely separated geographical areas were identical during\r\nthe time represented by the intermediate formation. Yet, unless they\r\nwere identical, we should not expect the fossils of the intermediate\r\nformation, where extant, to yield evidence of what the fossils would\r\nhave been in this same formation elsewhere, had it not been there\r\ndestroyed. Now, as a matter of fact, \"geological formations of each\r\nregion are almost invariably intermittent\"; and although in many cases a\r\nmore or less continuous record of past forms of life can be obtained by\r\ncomparing the fossils of one region and formation with those of another\r\nregion and adjacent formations, it is evident (from what we know of the\r\npresent geographical distribution of plants and animals) that not a few\r\ncases there must have been where the interruption of the record in one\r\nregion cannot be made good by thus interpolating the fossils of another\r\nregion. And we must remember it is by selecting the cases where this\r\ncannot be done that the objection before us is made to appear\r\nformidable. In other words, _unless_ whole groups of new species which\r\nare unknown in formation A appear suddenly in formation C of one region\r\n(X), where the intermediate formation B is absent; and _unless_ in some\r\nother region (Y), where B is present, the fossiliferous contents of B\r\nfail to supply the fossil ancestry of the new species in A (X); _unless_\r\nsuch a state of matters is found to obtain, the objection before us has\r\nnothing to say. But at best this is negative evidence; and, in order to\r\nconsider it fairly, we ought to set against it the cases where an\r\ninterposition of fossils found in B (Y) _does_ furnish the fossil\r\nancestry of what would _otherwise_ have been an abrupt appearance of\r\nwhole groups of new species in A (X). Now such cases are neither few\r\nnor unimportant, and therefore they deprive the objection of the force\r\nit would have had if the selected cases to the contrary were the general\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these considerations, the following, some of which are of\r\na more special kind, appear to me so important that I will quote them\r\nalmost _in extenso_.\r\n\r\n     We continually forget how large the world is, compared with the\r\n     area over which our geological formations have been carefully\r\n     examined: we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long\r\n     existed, and have slowly multiplied, before they invaded the\r\n     ancient archipelagoes of Europe and the United States. We do not\r\n     make due allowance for the intervals of time which have elapsed\r\n     between our consecutive formations,--longer perhaps in many cases\r\n     than the time required for the accumulation of each formation.\r\n     These intervals will have given time for the multiplication of\r\n     species from some one parent form; and, in the succeeding\r\n     formation, such groups of species will appear as if suddenly\r\n     created.\r\n\r\n     I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely, that it might\r\n     require a long succession of ages, to adapt an organism to some new\r\n     and peculiar line of life, for instance, to fly through the air;\r\n     and consequently that the transitional form would often long remain\r\n     confined to some one region; but that, when this adaptation had\r\n     once been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great\r\n     advantage over other organisms, a comparatively short time would be\r\n     necessary to produce many divergent forms, which would spread\r\n     rapidly and widely throughout the world....\r\n\r\n     In geological treatises, published not many years ago, mammals were\r\n     always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of\r\n     the tertiary series. And now one of the richest known accumulations\r\n     of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary series;\r\n     and true mammals have been discovered in the new red sandstone at\r\n     nearly the commencement of this great series. Cuvier used to urge\r\n     that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct\r\n     species have been discovered in India, South America, and in Europe\r\n     as far back as the miocene stage. Had it not been for the rare\r\n     accident of the preservation of footsteps in the new red sandstone\r\n     of the United States, who would have ventured to suppose that, no\r\n     less than at least thirty kinds of bird-like animals, some of\r\n     gigantic size, existed during that period? Not a fragment of bone\r\n     has been discovered in these beds. Not long ago palaeontologists\r\n     maintained that the whole class of birds came suddenly into\r\n     existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the\r\n     authority of Professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the\r\n     deposition of the upper green-sand. And still more recently that\r\n     strange bird, the Archeopteryx ... has been discovered in the\r\n     oolitic slates of Solenhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows\r\n     more forcibly than this, how little we as yet know of the former\r\n     inhabitants of the world.\r\n\r\n     I may give another instance, which, from having passed under my own\r\n     eyes, has much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes,\r\n     I stated that, from the number of existing and extinct tertiary\r\n     species; from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of\r\n     many species all over the world from the Arctic regions to the\r\n     equator, inhabiting various zones of depths from the upper tidal\r\n     limits to 50 fathoms; from the perfect manner in which specimens\r\n     are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds; from the ease with which\r\n     even a fragment of a valve can be recognized; from all these\r\n     circumstances, I inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed\r\n     during the secondary periods, they would certainly have been\r\n     preserved and discovered; and as not one species had then been\r\n     discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great group\r\n     had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary\r\n     series. This was a sore trouble to me, adding as I thought one more\r\n     instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. But\r\n     my work had hardly been published, when a skilful palaeontologist,\r\n     M. Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an\r\n     unmistakeable sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted\r\n     from the chalk of Belgium. And, as if to make the case as striking\r\n     as possible, this sessile cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very\r\n     common, large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one specimen has\r\n     as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum. Still more\r\n     recently, a Pyrgoma, a member of a distinct sub-family of sessile\r\n     cirripedes, has been discovered by Mr. Woodward in the upper chalk;\r\n     so that we now have abundant evidence of the existence of this\r\n     group of animals during the secondary period.\r\n\r\n     The case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the\r\n     apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that\r\n     of the teleostean fishes, low down, according to Agassiz, in the\r\n     Chalk period. This group includes the large majority of existing\r\n     species. But certain Jurassic and Triassic forms are now commonly\r\n     admitted to be teleostean; and even some palaeozoic forms have been\r\n     thus classed by one high authority. If the teleosteans had really\r\n     appeared suddenly in the northern hemisphere, the fact would have\r\n     been highly remarkable; but it would not have formed an insuperable\r\n     difficulty, unless it could likewise have been shown that at the\r\n     same period the species were suddenly and simultaneously developed\r\n     in other quarters of the world. It is almost superfluous to remark\r\n     that hardly any fossil fish are known from south of the equator;\r\n     and by running through Pictet's Palaeontology it will be seen that\r\n     very few species are known from several formations in Europe. Some\r\n     few families of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fish\r\n     might formerly have had a similarly confined range, and after\r\n     having been largely developed in some one sea, might have spread\r\n     widely. Nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world\r\n     have always been so freely open from south to north as they are at\r\n     present. Even at this day, if the Malay Archipelago were converted\r\n     into land, the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean would form a\r\n     large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great group of\r\n     marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would remain\r\n     confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler\r\n     climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or\r\n     Australia, and thus reach other and distant seas.\r\n\r\n     From these considerations, from our ignorance of the geology of\r\n     other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United\r\n     States; and from the revolution in our palaeontological knowledge\r\n     effected by the discoveries of the last dozen years, it seems to me\r\n     to be about as rash to dogmatize on the succession of organic\r\n     forms throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to\r\n     land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and\r\n     then to discuss the number and range of its productions[53].\r\n\r\n    [53] _Origin of Species_, 282-5.\r\n\r\nIn view of all the foregoing facts and considerations, it appears to me\r\nthat the second difficulty on our list is completely answered. Indeed,\r\neven on a moderate estimate of the imperfection of the geological\r\nrecord, the wonder would have been if many cases had _not_ occurred\r\nwhere groups of species present the fictitious appearance of having been\r\nsuddenly and simultaneously created in the particular formations where\r\ntheir remains now happen to be observable.\r\n\r\nTurning next to the third objection, there cannot be any question that\r\nevery here and there in the geological series animals occur of a much\r\nhigher grade zoologically than the theory of evolution would have\r\nexpected to find in the strata where they are found. At any rate,\r\nspeaking for myself, I should not have antecedently expected to meet\r\nwith such highly differentiated insects as butterflies and dragonflies\r\nin the middle of the Secondaries: still less should I have expected to\r\nencounter beetles, cockroaches, spiders, and May-flies in the upper and\r\nmiddle Primaries--not to mention an insect and a scorpion even in the\r\nlower. And I think the same remark applies to a whole sub-kingdom in the\r\ncase of Vertebrata. For although it is only the lowest class of the\r\nsub-kingdom which, so far as we positively know, was represented in the\r\nDevonian and Silurian formations, we must remember, on the one hand,\r\nthat even a cartilaginous or ganoid fish belongs to the highest\r\nsub-kingdom of the animal series; and, on the other hand, that such\r\nanimals are thus proved to have abounded in the very lowest strata where\r\nthere is good evidence of there having been any forms of life at all.\r\nLastly, the fact that Marsupials occur in the Trias, coupled with the\r\nfact that the still existing Monotremata are what may be termed animated\r\nfossils, referring us by their lowly type of organization to some period\r\nenormously more remote,--these facts render it practically certain that\r\nsome members of this very highest class of the highest sub-kingdom must\r\nhave existed far back in the Primaries.\r\n\r\nThese things, I say, I should not have expected to find, and I think all\r\nother evolutionists ought to be prepared to make the same\r\nacknowledgment. But as these things have been found, the only possible\r\nway of accounting for them on evolutionary principles is by supposing\r\nthat the geological record is even more imperfect than we needed to\r\nsuppose in order to meet the previous objections. I cannot see, however,\r\nwhy evolutionists should be afraid to make this acknowledgment. For I do\r\nnot know any reason which would lead us to suppose that there is any\r\ncommon measure between the distances marked on our tables of geological\r\nformations, and the times which those distances severally represent. Let\r\nthe reader turn to the table on page 163, and then let him say why the\r\n30,000 feet of so-called Azoic rocks may not represent a greater\r\nduration of time than does the thickness of all the Primary rocks above\r\nthem put together. For my own part I believe that this is probably the\r\ncase, looking to the enormous ages during which these very early\r\nformations must have been exposed to destructive agencies of all kinds,\r\nnow at one time and now at another, in different parts of the world.\r\nAnd, of course, we are without any means of surmising what ranges of\r\ntime are represented by the so-called Primeval rocks, for the simple\r\nreason that they are non-sedimentary, and non-sedimentary rocks cannot\r\nbe expected to contain fossils.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be answered, the 30,000 feet of Azoic rocks, lying above\r\nthe Primeval, _are_ sedimentary to some extent: they are not all\r\ncompletely metamorphic: yet they are all destitute of fossils. This is\r\nthe fourth and last difficulty which has to be met, and it can only be\r\nmet by the considerations which have been advanced by Lyell and Darwin.\r\nThe former says:--\r\n\r\n     The total absence of any trace of fossils has inclined many\r\n     geologists to attribute the origin of the most ancient strata to an\r\n     azoic period, or one antecedent to the existence of organic beings.\r\n     Admitting, they say, the obliteration, in some cases, of fossils by\r\n     plutonic action, we might still expect that traces of them would\r\n     oftener be found in certain ancient systems of slate, which can\r\n     scarcely be said to have assumed a crystalline structure. But in\r\n     urging this argument it seems to be forgotten that there are\r\n     stratified formations of enormous thickness, and of various ages,\r\n     some of them even of tertiary date, and which we know were formed\r\n     after the earth had become the abode of living creatures, which\r\n     are, nevertheless, in some districts, entirely destitute of all\r\n     vestiges of organic bodies[54].\r\n\r\n     [54] _Elements of Geology_, p. 587.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to mention sundry causes (in addition to plutonic\r\naction) which are adequate to destroy the fossiliferous contents of\r\nstratified rocks, and to show that these may well have produced enormous\r\ndestruction of organic remains in these oldest of known formations.\r\n\r\nDarwin's view is that, during the vast ages of time now under\r\nconsideration, it is probable that the distribution of sea and land over\r\nthe earth's surface has not been uniformly the same, even as regards\r\noceans and continents. Now, if this were the case, \"it might well happen\r\nthat strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the\r\nearth, and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of\r\nsuperincumbent water, might have undergone far more metamorphic action\r\nthan strata which have always remained nearer to the surface. The\r\nimmense areas in some parts of the world, for instance in South America,\r\nof naked metamorphic rocks, which must have been heated under great\r\npressure, have always seemed to me to require some special explanation;\r\nand we may perhaps believe that we see, in these large areas, the many\r\nformations long anterior to the Cambrian epoch in a completely\r\nmetamorphosed and denuded condition[55].\" The probability of this view\r\nhe sustains by certain general considerations, as well as particular\r\nfacts touching the geology of oceanic islands, &c.\r\n\r\n    [55] _Origin of Species_, p. 289.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, it seems to me but reasonable to conclude, with\r\nregard to all four objections in question, as Darwin concludes with\r\nregard to them:--\r\n\r\n     For my part, following out Lyell's metaphor, I look at the\r\n     geological record as a history of the world imperfectly kept,\r\n     written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last\r\n     volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Of this\r\n     volume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved; and\r\n     of each page only here and there a few lines. Each word of the\r\n     slowly-changing language, more or less different in the successive\r\n     chapters, may represent the forms of life, which are entombed in\r\n     our consecutive formations, and which falsely appear to us to have\r\n     been abruptly introduced. On this view, the difficulties above\r\n     discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear[56].\r\n\r\n     [56] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, the only reasonable exception that can be taken to\r\nthis general view of the whole matter, is one which has been taken from\r\nthe side of astronomical physics.\r\n\r\nPut briefly, it is alleged by one of the highest authorities in this\r\nbranch of science, that there cannot have been any such enormous reaches\r\nof unrecorded time as would be implied by the supposition of there\r\nhaving been a lost history of organic evolution before the Cambrian\r\nperiod. The grounds of this allegation I am not qualified to examine;\r\nbut in a general way I agree with Prof. Huxley in feeling that, from the\r\nvery nature of the case, they are necessarily precarious,--and this in\r\nso high a degree that any conclusions raised on such premises are not\r\nentitled to be deemed formidable[57].\r\n\r\n    [57] See _Lay Sermons_, Lecture on Geological Reform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning now to plants, the principal and the ablest opponent of the\r\ntheory of evolution is here unquestionably Mr. Carruthers[58]. The\r\ndifficulties which he adduces may be classified under three heads, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    [58] See especially the following Presidential addresses:--Geol.\r\n    Assoc. Nov. 1876; Section D. Brit. Assoc., 1886; Lin. Soc., 1890.\r\n\r\n1. There is no evidence of change in specific forms of existing plants.\r\nNot only are the numerous species of plants which have been found in\r\nEgyptian mummies indistinguishable from their successors of to-day; but,\r\nwhat is of far more importance, a large number of our own indigenous\r\nplants grew in Great Britain during the glacial period (including under\r\nthis term the warm periods between those of successive glaciations), and\r\nin no one case does it appear that any modification of specific type has\r\noccurred. This fact is particularly remarkable as regards leaves,\r\nbecause on the one hand they are the organs of plants which are most\r\nprone to vary, while on the other hand they are likewise the organs\r\nwhich lend themselves most perfectly to the process of fossilization, so\r\nthat all details of their structure can be minutely observed in the\r\nfossil state. Yet the interval since the glacial period, although not a\r\nlong one geologically speaking, is certainly what may be called an\r\nappreciable portion of time in the history of Dicotyledonous plants\r\nsince their first appearance in the Cretaceous epoch. Again, if we\r\nextend this kind of enquiry so as to include the world as a whole, a\r\nnumber of other species of plants dating from the glacial epoch are\r\nfound to tell the same story--notwithstanding that, in the opinion of\r\nMr. Carruthers, they must all have undergone many changes of environment\r\nwhile advancing before, and retreating after, successive glaciations in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe. Or, to quote his own words:--\"The various\r\nphysical conditions which of necessity affected these {41} species in\r\ntheir diffusion over such large areas of the earth's surface in the\r\ncourse of, say, 250,000 years, should have led to the production of many\r\nvarieties; but the uniform testimony of the remains of this considerable\r\npre-glacial flora, as far as the materials admit of a comparison, is\r\nthat no appreciable change has taken place.\"\r\n\r\n2. There is no appearance of generalized forms among the earliest plants\r\nwith which we are acquainted. For example, in the first dry land\r\nflora--the Devonian--we have representatives of the _Filices_,\r\n_Equisetaceae_, and _Lycopodiaceae_, all as highly specialized as their\r\nliving representatives, and exhibiting the differential characters of\r\nthese closely related groups. Moreover, these plants were even more\r\nhighly organized than their existing descendants in regard to their\r\nvegetative structure, and in some cases also in regard to their\r\nreproductive organs. So likewise the Gymnosperms of that time show in\r\ntheir fossil state the same highly organized woody structure as their\r\nliving representatives.\r\n\r\n3. Similarly, and more generally, the Dicotyledonous plants, which first\r\nappear in the Cretaceous rocks, appear there suddenly, without any forms\r\nleading up to them--notwithstanding that \"we know very well the\r\nextensive flora of the underlying Wealden.\" Moreover, we have all the\r\nthree great divisions of the Dicotyledons appearing together, and so\r\nhighly differentiated that all the species are referred to existing\r\ngenera, with the exception of a very few imperfectly preserved, and\r\ntherefore uncertain fragments.\r\n\r\nSuch being the facts, we may begin by noticing that, even at first\r\nsight, they present different degrees of difficulty. Thus, I cannot see\r\nthat there is much difficulty with regard to those in class 2. Only if\r\nwe were to take the popular (and very erroneous) view of organic\r\nevolution as a process which is always and everywhere bound to promote\r\nthe specialization of organic types--only then ought we to see any real\r\ndifficulty in the absence of generalized types preceding these existing\r\ntypes. Of course we may wonder why still lower down in the geological\r\nseries we do not meet with more generalized (or ancestral) types; but\r\nthis is the difficulty number 3, which we now proceed to examine.\r\n\r\nConcerning the other two difficulties, then, the only possible way of\r\nmeeting that as to the absence of any parent forms lower down in the\r\ngeological series is by falling back--as in the analogous case of\r\nanimals--upon the imperfection of the geological record. Although it is\r\ncertainly remarkable that we should not encounter any forms serving to\r\nconnect the Dicotyledonous plants of the Chalk with the lower forms of\r\nthe underlying Wealden, we must again remember that difficulties thus\r\ndepending on the absence of any corroborative record, are by no means\r\nequivalent to what would have arisen in the presence of an adverse\r\nrecord--such, for instance, as would have been exhibited had the floras\r\nof the Wealden and the Chalk been inverted. But, as the case actually\r\nstands, the mere fact that Dicotyledonous plants, where they first\r\noccur, are found to have been already differentiated into their three\r\nmain divisions, is in itself sufficient evidence, on the general theory\r\nof evolution, that there must be a break in the record as hitherto known\r\nbetween the Wealden and the Chalk. Nor is it easy to see how the\r\nopponents of this theory can prove their negative by furnishing evidence\r\nto the contrary. And although such might justly be deemed an unfair way\r\nof putting the matter, were this the only case where the geological\r\nrecord is in evidence, it is not so when we remember that there are\r\nnumberless other cases where the geological record does testify to\r\nconnecting links in a most satisfactory manner. For in view of this\r\nconsideration the burden of proof is thrown upon those who point to\r\nparticular cases where there is thus a conspicuous absence of\r\ntransitional forms--the burden, namely, of proving that such cases are\r\nnot due merely to a break in the record. Besides, the break in the\r\nrecord as regards this particular case may be apparent rather than real.\r\nFor I suppose there is no greater authority on the pure geology of the\r\nsubject than Sir Charles Lyell, and this is what he says of the\r\nparticular case in question. \"If the passage seem at present to be\r\nsomewhat sudden from the flora of the Lower or Neocomian to that of the\r\nUpper Cretaceous period, the abruptness of the change will probably\r\ndisappear when we are better acquainted with the fossil vegetation of\r\nthe uppermost tracts of the Neocomian and that of the lowest strata of\r\nthe Gault, or true Cretaceous series[59].\"\r\n\r\n    [59] _Elements of Geology_, p. 280.\r\n\r\nLastly, the fact of the flora of the glacial epoch not having exhibited\r\nany modifications during the long residence of some of its specific\r\ntypes in Great Britain and elsewhere, is a fact of some importance to\r\nthe general theory of evolution, since it shows a higher degree of\r\nstability on the part of these specific types than might perhaps have\r\nbeen expected, supposing the theory to be true. But I do not see that\r\nthis constitutes a difficulty against the theory, when we have so many\r\nother cases of proved transmutation to set against it. For instance, not\r\nto go further afield than this very glacial flora itself, it will be\r\nremembered that in an earlier chapter I selected it as furnishing\r\nspecially cogent proof of the transmutation of species. What, then, is\r\nthe explanation of so extraordinary a difference between Mr. Carruthers'\r\nviews and my own upon this point? I believe the explanation to be that\r\nhe does not take a sufficiently wide survey of the facts.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it seems to me that he exaggerates the vicissitudes to\r\nwhich the species of plants that he calls into evidence have been\r\nexposed while advancing before, and retreating after, the ice. Rather do\r\nI agree with Darwin that \"they would not have been exposed during their\r\nlong migrations to any great diversity of temperature; and as they all\r\nmigrated in a body together, their mutual relations will not have been\r\nmuch disturbed; hence, in accordance with the principles indicated in\r\nthis volume, these forms will not have been liable to much\r\nmodification[60].\" But, be this matter of opinion as it may, a much\r\nbetter test is afforded by those numerous cases all the world over,\r\nwhere arctic species have been left stranded on alpine areas by the\r\nretreat of glaciation; because here there is no room for differences of\r\nopinion as to a \"change of environment\" having taken place. Not to speak\r\nof climatic differences between arctic and alpine stations, consider\r\nmerely the changes which must have taken place in the relations of the\r\nthus isolated species to each other, as well as to those of all the\r\nforeign plants, insects, &c., with which they have long been thrown into\r\nclose association. If in _such_ cases no variation or transmutation had\r\ntaken place since the glacial epoch, then indeed there would have been a\r\ndifficulty of some magnitude. But, by parity of reasoning, whatever\r\ndegree of difficulty would have been thus presented is not merely\r\ndischarged, but converted into at least an equal degree of\r\ncorroboration, when it is found that under such circumstances, in\r\nwhatever part of the world they have occurred, some considerable amount\r\nof variation and transmutation has always taken place,--and this in the\r\nanimals as well as in the plants. For instance, again to quote Darwin,\r\n\"If we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the several\r\ngreat European mountain-ranges one with another, though many of the\r\nspecies remain identically the same, some exist as varieties, some as\r\ndoubtful forms or sub-species, and some as distinct yet closely allied\r\nspecies representing each other on the several ranges[61].\" Lastly, if\r\ninstead of considering the case of alpine floras, we take the much\r\nlarger case of the Old and New World as a whole, we meet with much\r\nlarger proofs of the same general facts. For, \"during the slowly\r\ndecreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as the species in\r\ncommon, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated south of the\r\nPolar Circle, they will have been completely cut off from each other.\r\nThis separation, as far as the more temperate productions are concerned,\r\nmust have taken place long ages ago. As the plants and animals migrated\r\nsouthward, they will have become mingled in one great region with the\r\nnative American productions, and would have had to compete with them;\r\nand, in the other great region, with those of the Old World.\r\nConsequently we have here everything favourable for much\r\nmodification,--for far more modification than with the Alpine\r\nproductions left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the\r\nseveral mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of Europe and N.\r\nAmerica. Hence it has come, that when we compare the now living\r\nproductions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find\r\nvery few identical species; but we find in every class many forms, which\r\nsome naturalists rank as geographical races, and others as distinct\r\nspecies; and a host of closely allied or representative forms which are\r\nranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct[62].\"\r\n\r\n    [60] _Origin of Species_, p. 332.\r\n\r\n    [61] _Origin of Species_, p. 332.\r\n\r\n    [62] _Ibid_. pp. 333-4.\r\n\r\nIn view then of all the above considerations--and especially those\r\nquoted from Darwin--it appears to me that far from raising any\r\ndifficulty against the theory of evolution, the facts adduced by Mr.\r\nCarruthers make in favour of it. For when once these facts are taken in\r\nconnection with the others above mentioned, they serve to complete the\r\ncorrespondence between degrees of modification with degrees of time on\r\nthe one hand, and with degrees of evolution, of change of environment,\r\n&c., on the other. Or, in the words of Le Conte, when dealing with this\r\nvery subject, \"It is impossible to conceive a more beautiful\r\nillustration of the principles we have been trying to enforce[63].\"\r\n\r\n    [63] _Evolution and its Relation to Religious Thought_, p. 194.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A TO PAGE 257.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passages in Dr. Whewell's writings, to which allusion is here made,\r\nare somewhat too long to be quoted in the text. But as I think they\r\ndeserved to be given, I will here reprint a letter which I wrote to\r\n_Nature_ in March, 1888.\r\n\r\n     In his essay on the _Reception of the Origin of Species_, Prof.\r\n     Huxley writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is interesting to observe that the possibility of a fifth\r\n     alternative, in addition to the four he has stated, has not dawned\r\n     upon Dr. Whewell's mind\" (_Life and Lectures of Charles Darwin_,\r\n     vol. ii, p. 195).\r\n\r\n     And again, in the article _Science_, supplied to _The Reign of\r\n     Queen Victoria_, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Whewell had not the slightest suspicion of Darwin's main theorem,\r\n     even as a logical possibility\" (p 365).\r\n\r\n     Now, although it is true that no indication of such a logical\r\n     possibility is to be met with in the _History of the Inductive\r\n     Sciences_, there are several passages in the _Bridgewater Treatise_\r\n     which show a glimmering idea of such a possibility. Of these the\r\n     following are, perhaps, worth quoting. Speaking of the adaptation\r\n     of the period of flowering to the length of a year, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Now such an adjustment must surely be accepted as a proof of\r\n     design, exercised in the formation of the world. Why should the\r\n     solar year be so long and no longer? or, this being such a length,\r\n     why should the vegetable cycle be exactly of the same length? Can\r\n     this be chance?... And, if not by chance, how otherwise could such\r\n     a coincidence occur than by an intentional adjustment of these two\r\n     things to one another; by a selection of such an organization in\r\n     plants as would fit them to the earth on which they were to grow;\r\n     by an adaptation of construction to conditions; of the scale of\r\n     construction to the scale of conditions? It cannot be accepted as\r\n     an explanation of this fact in the economy of plants, that it is\r\n     necessary to their existence; that no plants could possibly have\r\n     subsisted, and come down to us, except those which were thus\r\n     suited to their place on the earth. This is true; but it does not\r\n     at all remove the necessity of recurring to design as the origin of\r\n     the construction by which the existence and continuance of plants\r\n     is made possible. A watch could not go unless there were the most\r\n     exact adjustment in the forms and positions of its wheels; yet no\r\n     one would accept it as an explanation of the origin of such forms\r\n     and positions that the watch would not go if these were other than\r\n     they were. If the objector were to suppose that plants were\r\n     originally fitted to years of various lengths, and that such only\r\n     have survived to the present time as had a cycle of a length equal\r\n     to our present year, or one which could be accommodated to it, we\r\n     should reply that the assumption is too gratuitous and extravagant\r\n     to require much consideration.\"\r\n\r\n     Again, with regard to \"the diurnal period,\" he adds:--\r\n\r\n     \"Any supposition that the astronomical cycle has occasioned the\r\n     physiological one, that the structure of plants has been brought to\r\n     be what it is by the action of external causes, or that such plants\r\n     as could not accommodate themselves to the existing day have\r\n     perished, would be not only an arbitrary and baseless assumption,\r\n     but, moreover, useless for the purposes of explanation which it\r\n     professes, as we have noticed of a similar supposition with respect\r\n     to the annual cycle.\"\r\n\r\n     Of course these passages in no way make against Mr. Huxley's\r\n     allusions to Dr. Whewell's writings in proof that, until the\r\n     publication of the _Origin of Species_, the \"main theorem\" of this\r\n     work had not dawned on any other mind, save that of Mr. Wallace.\r\n     But these passages show, even more emphatically than total silence\r\n     with regard to the principle of survival could have done, the real\r\n     distance which at that time separated the minds of thinking men\r\n     from all that was wrapped up in this principle. For they show that\r\n     Dr. Whewell, even after he had obtained a glimpse of the principle\r\n     \"as a logical possibility,\" only saw in it an \"arbitrary and\r\n     baseless assumption.\" Moreover, the passages show a remarkable\r\n     juxtaposition of the very terms in which the theory of natural\r\n     selection was afterwards formulated. Indeed, if we strike out the\r\n     one word \"intentional\" (which conveys the preconceived idea of the\r\n     writer, and thus prevented him from doing justice to any\r\n     naturalistic view), all the following parts of the above quotations\r\n     might be supposed to have been written by a Darwinian. \"If not by\r\n     chance, how otherwise could such a coincidence occur, than by an\r\n     _adjustment_ of these two things to one another; by a _selection_\r\n     of such an organization in plants as would _fit_ them to the earth\r\n     on which they were to grow; by an adaptation of _construction_ to\r\n     _conditions_; of the _scale_ of construction to the _scale_ of\r\n     conditions?\" Yet he immediately goes on to say: \"If the objector\r\n     were to suppose that plants were originally _fitted_ to years of\r\n     various lengths, and that such only have _survived_ to the present\r\n     time ... _as could be accommodated to it_ (i. e. the actual cycle),\r\n     we should reply that the assumption is too gratuitous and\r\n     extravagant to require much consideration.\" Was there ever a more\r\n     curious exhibition of failure to perceive the importance of a\r\n     \"logical possibility\"? And this at the very time when another mind\r\n     was bestowing twenty years of labour on its \"consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE B TO PAGE 295.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince these remarks were delivered in my lectures as here printed, Mr.\r\nMivart has alluded to the subject in the following and precisely\r\nopposite sense:--\r\n\r\n     Many of the more noteworthy instincts lead us from manifestations\r\n     of purpose directed to the maintenance of the individual, to no\r\n     less plain manifestations of a purpose directed to the preservation\r\n     of the race. But a careful study of the interrelations and\r\n     interdependencies which exist between the various orders of\r\n     creatures inhabiting this planet shows us yet a more noteworthy\r\n     teleology--the existence of whole orders of such creatures being\r\n     directed to the service of other orders in various degrees of\r\n     subordination and augmentation respectively. This study reveals to\r\n     us, as a fact, the enchainment of all the various orders of\r\n     creatures in a hierarchy of activities, in harmony with what we\r\n     might expect to find in a world the outcome of a First Cause\r\n     possessed of intelligence and will[64].\r\n\r\n     [64] _On Truth_, p. 493.\r\n\r\nHaving read this much, a Darwinian is naturally led to expect that Mr.\r\nMivart is about to offer some examples of instincts or structures\r\nexemplifying what in the margin he calls the \"Hierarchy of\r\nMinistrations.\" Yet the only facts he proceeds to adduce are the\r\nsufficiently obvious facts, that the inorganic world existed before the\r\norganic, plants before herbivorous animals, these before carnivorous,\r\nand so on: that is to say, everywhere the conditions to the occurrence\r\nof any given stage of evolution preceded such occurrence, as it is\r\nobvious that they must, if, as of course it is not denied, the\r\npossibility of such occurrence depended on the precedence of such\r\nconditions. Now, it is surely obvious that such a \"hierarchy of\r\nministrations\" as this, far from telling against the theory of natural\r\nselection, is the very thing which tells most in its favour. The fact\r\nthat animals, for instance, only appeared upon the earth after there\r\nwere plants for them to feed upon, is clearly a necessity of the case,\r\nwhether or not there was any design in the matter. Such \"ministrations,\"\r\ntherefore, as plant-organisms yield to animal-organisms is just the kind\r\nof ministration that the theory of natural selection requires. Thus far,\r\nthen, both the theories--natural selection and super-natural\r\ndesign--have an equal right to appropriate the facts. But now, if in no\r\none instance can it be shown that the ministration of plant-life to\r\nanimal-life is of such a kind as to subserve the interests of\r\nanimal-life without at the same time subserving those of the plant-life\r\nitself, then the fact makes wholly in favour of the naturalistic\r\nexplanation of such ministration as appears. If any plants had presented\r\nany characters pointing prospectively to needs of animals without\r\nprimarily ministering to their own, then, indeed, there would have been\r\nno room for the theory of natural selection. But as this can nowhere be\r\nalleged, the theory of natural selection finds all the facts to be\r\nexactly as it requires them to be: such ministration as plants yield to\r\nanimals becomes so much evidence of natural selection having slowly\r\nformed the animals to appropriate the nutrition which the plants had\r\npreviously gathered--and gathered under the previous influence of\r\nnatural selection acting on themselves entirely for their own sakes.\r\nTherefore I say it is painfully manifest that \"the enchainment of all\r\nthe various orders of creatures in a hierarchy of activities,\" is _not_\r\n\"in harmony with what we might expect to find in a world the outcome of\r\na First Cause possessed of intelligence and [beneficent] will.\" So far\r\nas any argument from such \"enchainment\" reaches, it makes entirely\r\nagainst the view which Mr. Mivart is advocating. In point of fact, there\r\nis a total absence of any such \"ministration\" by one \"order of\r\ncreatures\" to the needs of any other order, as the beneficent design\r\ntheory would necessarily expect; while such ministration as actually\r\ndoes obtain is exactly and universally the kind which the naturalistic\r\ntheory requires.\r\n\r\nAgain, quite independently, and still more recently, Mr. Mivart alluded\r\nin _Nature_ (vol. xli, p. 41) to the difficulty which the apparently\r\nexceptional case of gall-formation presents to the theory of natural\r\nselection. Therefore I supplied (vol. xli, p. 80) the suggestion given\r\nin the text, viz. that although it appears impossible that the sometimes\r\nremarkably elaborate and adaptive structures of galls can be due to\r\nnatural selection acting directly on the plants themselves--seeing that\r\nthe adaptation has reference to the needs of their parasites--it is\r\nquite possible that the phenomena may be due to natural selection acting\r\nindirectly on the plants, by always preserving those individual insects\r\n(and larvae) the character of whose secretions is such as will best\r\ninduce the particular shapes of galls that are required. Several other\r\ncorrespondents took part in the discussion, and most of them accepted\r\nthe above explanation. Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell, however, advanced another\r\nand very ingenious hypothesis, showing that there is certainly one\r\nconceivable way in which natural selection might have produced all the\r\nphenomena of gall-formation by acting directly on the plants\r\nthemselves[65]. Subsequently Mr. Cockerell published another paper upon\r\nthe subject, stating his views at greater length. The following is the\r\nsubstance of his theory as there presented:--\r\n\r\n     [65] _Nature_, vol. xli, p. 344.\r\n\r\n     Doubtless there were internal plant-feeding larvae before there\r\n     were galls: and, indeed, we have geological evidence that boring\r\n     insects date very far back indeed. The primitive internal feeders,\r\n     then, were miners in the roots, stems, twigs, or leaves, such as\r\n     occur very commonly at the present day. These miners are\r\n     excessively harmful to plant-life, and form a class of the most\r\n     destructive insect-pests known to the farmer: they frequently cause\r\n     the death of the whole or part of the plant attacked. Now, we may\r\n     suppose that the secretions of certain of these insects caused a\r\n     swelling to appear where the larvae lived, and on this excrescence\r\n     the larvae fed. It is easy to see that the greater the excrescence,\r\n     and the greater the tendency of the larvae to feed upon it, instead\r\n     of destroying the vital tissues, the smaller is the amount of harm\r\n     to the plant. Now the continued life and vitality of the plant is\r\n     beneficial to the larvae, and the larger or more perfect the gall,\r\n     the greater the amount of available food. Hence natural selection\r\n     will have preserved and accumulated the gall-forming tendencies, as\r\n     not only beneficial to the larvae, but as a means whereby the\r\n     larvae can feed with least harm to the plant. So far from being\r\n     developed for the exclusive benefit of the larvae, it is easy to\r\n     see that, allowing a tendency to gall-formation, natural selection\r\n     would have developed galls exclusively for the benefit of the\r\n     plants, so that they might suffer a minimum of harm from the\r\n     unavoidable attacks of insects.\r\n\r\n     But here it may be questioned--have we proof that internal feeders\r\n     tend to form galls? In answer to this I would point out that\r\n     gall-formation is a peculiar feature, and cannot be expected to\r\n     arise in every group of internal feeders. But I think we can afford\r\n     sufficient proof that wherever it has arisen it has been preserved;\r\n     and further, that even the highly complex forms of galls are\r\n     evolved from forms so simple that we hesitate to call them galls at\r\n     all[66].\r\n\r\n     [66] _Entomologist_, March, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe paper then proceeds to give a number of individual cases. No doubt\r\nthe principal objection to which Mr. Cockerell's hypothesis is open is\r\none that was pointed out by Herr Wetterhan, viz. \"the much greater\r\nfacility afforded to the indirect action through insects, by the\r\nenormously more rapid succession of generations with the latter than\r\nwith many of their vegetable hosts--oaks above all[67].\" This\r\ndifficulty, however, Mr. Cockerell believes maybe surmounted by the\r\nconsideration that a growing plant need not be regarded as a single\r\nindividual, but rather as an assemblage of such[68].\r\n\r\n    [67] _Nature_, vol. xli, p. 394.\r\n\r\n    [68] _Ibid._ vol. xli, pp. 559-560.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE C TO PAGE 394.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only remarks that Mr. Wallace has to offer on the _pattern of\r\ncolours_, as distinguished from a mere _brilliancy of colour_, are added\r\nas an afterthought suggested to him by the late Mr. Alfred Tylor's book\r\non _Colouration of Animals and Plants_ (1886). But, in the first place,\r\nit appears to me that Mr. Wallace has formed an altogether extravagant\r\nestimate of the value of this work. For the object of the work is to\r\nshow, \"that diversified colouration follows the chief lines of\r\nstructure, and changes at points, such as the joints, where function\r\nchanges.\" Now, in publishing this generalization, Mr. Tylor--who was not\r\na naturalist--took only a very limited view of the facts. When applied\r\nto the animal kingdom as a whole, the theory is worthless; and even\r\nwithin the limits of mammals, birds, and insects--which are the classes\r\nto which Mr. Tylor mainly applies it--there are vastly more facts to\r\nnegative than to support it. This may be at once made apparent by the\r\nfollowing brief quotation from Prof. Lloyd Morgan:--\r\n\r\n     It can hardly be maintained that the theory affords us any adequate\r\n     explanation of the _specific_ colour-tints of the humming-birds, or\r\n     the pheasants, or the Papilionidae among butterflies. If, as Mr.\r\n     Wallace argues, the immense tufts of golden plumage in the bird of\r\n     paradise owe their origin to the fact that they are attached just\r\n     above the point where the arteries and nerves for the supply of the\r\n     pectoral muscles leave the interior of the body--and the\r\n     physiological rationale is not altogether obvious,--are there no\r\n     other birds in which similar arteries and nerves are found in a\r\n     similar position? Why have these no similar tufts? And why, in the\r\n     birds of paradise themselves, does it require four years ere these\r\n     nervous and arterial influences take effect upon the plumage?\r\n     Finally, one would inquire how the colour is determined and held\r\n     constant in each species. The difficulty of the Tylor-Wallace view,\r\n     even as a matter of origin, is especially great in those numerous\r\n     cases in which the colour is determined by delicate lines, thin\r\n     plates, or thin films of air or fluid. Mr. Poulton, who takes a\r\n     similar line of argument in his _Colours of Animals_ (p. 326), lays\r\n     special stress on the production of _white_ (pp. 201-202).\r\n\r\nAs regards the latter point, it may be noticed that not in any part of\r\nhis writings, so far as I can find, does Mr. Wallace allude to the\r\nhighly important fact of colours in animals being so largely due to\r\nthese purely physical causes. Everywhere he argues as if colours were\r\nuniversally due to pigments; and in my opinion this unaccountable\r\noversight is the gravest defect in Mr. Wallace's treatment both of the\r\nfacts and the philosophy of colouration in the animal kingdom. For\r\ninstance, as regards the particular case of sexual colouration, the\r\noversight has prevented him from perceiving that his theory of\r\n\"brilliancy\" as due to \"a surplus of vital energy,\" is not so much as\r\nlogically possible in what must constitute at least one good half of the\r\nfacts to which he applies it--unless he shows that there is some\r\nconnection between vital energy and the development of striations,\r\nimprisonment of air-bubbles, &c. But any such connection--so\r\nessentially important for his theory--he does not even attempt to show.\r\nLastly, and quite apart from these remarkable oversights, even if Mr.\r\nTylor's hypothesis were as reasonable and well-sustained as it is\r\nfanciful and inadequate, still it could not apply to _sexual_\r\ncolouration: it could apply only to colouration as affected by\r\nphysiological functions common to both sexes. Yet it is in order to\r\nfurnish a \"preferable substitute\" for Mr. Darwin's theory of _sexual_\r\ncolouration, that Mr. Wallace adduces the hypothesis in question as one\r\nof \"great weight\"! In this matter, therefore, I entirely agree with\r\nPoulton and Lloyd Morgan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAccident, Darwin's use of the word, 334-340;\r\n  beauty due to, 408,
