MORITZ.\r\n\r\n_13th July, 1892._\r\n\r\nDEAR HOLLAND,\r\n\r\nThis book is associated in my mind with St. Moritz (where I worked at\r\nit), and therefore with you.\r\n\r\nI inscribe your name on it, not only in token of my remembrance of your\r\nmany acts of friendship, but also as a sign of my respect for one who\r\nlives a difficult life well.\r\n\r\nYours gratefully,\r\nFRANCIS DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For myself I found that I was fitted for nothing so well as for the\r\nstudy of Truth; ... as being gifted by nature with desire to seek,\r\npatience to doubt, fondness to meditate, slowness to assert, readiness\r\nto reconsider, carefulness to dispose and set in order; and as being a\r\nman that neither affects what is new nor admires what is old, and that\r\nhates every kind of imposture. So I thought my nature had a kind of\r\nfamiliarity and relationship with Truth.\"--BACON. (Proem to the\r\n_Interpretatio Naturae_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE FIRST EDITION (1892).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn preparing this volume, which is practically an abbreviation of the\r\n_Life and Letters_ (1887), my aim has been to retain as far as possible\r\nthe personal parts of those volumes. To render this feasible, large\r\nnumbers of the more purely scientific letters are omitted, or\r\nrepresented by the citation of a few sentences.[1] In certain periods of\r\nmy father's life the scientific and the personal elements run a parallel\r\ncourse, rising and falling together in their degree of interest. Thus\r\nthe writing of the _Origin of Species_, and its publication, appeal\r\nequally to the reader who follows my father's career from interest in\r\nthe man, and to the naturalist who desires to know something of this\r\nturning point in the history of Biology. This part of the story has\r\ntherefore been told with nearly the full amount of available detail.\r\n\r\nIn arranging my material I have followed a roughly chronological\r\nsequence, but the character and variety of my father's researches make a\r\nstrictly chronological order an impossibility. It was his habit to work\r\nmore or less simultaneously at several subjects. Experimental work was\r\noften carried on as a refreshment or variety, while books entailing\r\nreasoning and the marshalling of large bodies of facts were being\r\nwritten. Moreover many of his researches were dropped only to be resumed\r\nafter years had elapsed. Thus a chronological record of his work would\r\nbe a patchwork, from which it would be difficult to disentangle the\r\nhistory of any given subject. The Table of Contents will show how I have\r\ntried to avoid this result. It will be seen, for instance, that after\r\nChapter VIII. a break occurs; the story turns back from 1854 to 1831 in\r\norder that the Evolutionary chapters which follow may tell a continuous\r\nstory. In the same way the Botanical Work which occupied so much of my\r\nfather's time during the latter part of his life is treated separately\r\nin Chapters XVI. and XVII.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Chapter IV., in which I have attempted to give an account\r\nof my father's manner of working, I may be allowed to say that I acted\r\nas his assistant during the last eight years of his life, and had\r\ntherefore an opportunity of knowing something of his habits and methods.\r\n\r\nMy acknowledgments are gladly made to the publishers of the _Century\r\nMagazine_, who have courteously given me the use of one of their\r\nillustrations for the heading of Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS DARWIN.\r\n\r\nWYCHFIELD, CAMBRIDGE,\r\n_August, 1892_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] I have not thought it necessary to indicate all the omissions in the\r\nabbreviated letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is pleasure to me to acknowledge the kindness of Messrs.

Dr. Darwin was a son\r\nof Erasmus Darwin, sometimes described as a poet, but more deservedly\r\nknown as physician and naturalist. Charles Darwin's mother was Susannah,\r\ndaughter of Josiah Wedgwood, the well-known potter of Etruria, in\r\nStaffordshire.\r\n\r\nIf such speculations are permissible, we may hazard the guess that\r\nCharles Darwin inherited his sweetness of disposition from the Wedgwood\r\nside, while the character of his genius came rather from the Darwin\r\ngrandfather.[2]\r\n\r\nRobert Waring Darwin was a man of well-marked character. He had no\r\npretensions to being a man of science, no tendency to generalise his\r\nknowledge, and though a successful physician he was guided more by\r\nintuition and everyday observation than by a deep knowledge of his\r\nsubject. His chief mental characteristics were his keen powers of\r\nobservation, and his knowledge of men, qualities which led him to \"read\r\nthe characters and even the thoughts of those whom he saw even for a\r\nshort time.\" It is not therefore surprising that his help should have\r\nbeen sought, not merely in illness, but in cases of family trouble and\r\nsorrow. This was largely the case, and his wise sympathy, no less than\r\nhis medical skill, obtained for him a strong influence over the lives of\r\na large number of people. He was a man of a quick, vivid temperament,\r\nwith a lively interest in even the smaller details in the lives of those\r\nwith whom he came in contact. He was fond of society, and entertained a\r\ngood deal, and with his large practice and many friends, the life at\r\nShrewsbury must have been a stirring and varied one--very different in\r\nthis respect to the later home of his son at Down.[3]\r\n\r\nWe have a miniature of his wife, Susannah, with a remarkably sweet and\r\nhappy face, bearing some resemblance to the portrait of her father\r\npainted by Sir Joshua Reynolds; a countenance expressive of the gentle\r\nand sympathetic nature which Miss Meteyard ascribes to her.[4] She died\r\nJuly 15, 1817, thirty-two years before her husband, whose death occurred\r\non November 13, 1848. Dr. Darwin lived before his marriage for two or\r\nthree years on St. John's Hill, afterwards at the Crescent, where his\r\neldest daughter Marianne was born, lastly at the \"Mount,\" in the part of\r\nShrewsbury known as Frankwell, where the other children were born. This\r\nhouse was built by Dr. Darwin about 1800, it is now in the possession of\r\nMr. Spencer Phillips, and has undergone but little alteration. It is a\r\nlarge, plain, square, red-brick house, of which the most attractive\r\nfeature is the pretty green-house, opening out of the morning-room.\r\n\r\nThe house is charmingly placed, on the top of a steep bank leading down\r\nto the Severn. The terraced bank is traversed by a long walk, leading\r\nfrom end to end, still called \"the Doctor's Walk.\" At one point in this\r\nwalk grows a Spanish chestnut, the branches of which bend back parallel\r\nto themselves in a curious manner, and this was Charles Darwin's\r\nfavourite tree as a boy, where he and his sister Catharine had each\r\ntheir special seat.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor took great pleasure in his garden, planting it with\r\nornamental trees and shrubs, and being especially successful with fruit\r\ntrees; and this love of plants was, I think, the only taste kindred to\r\nnatural history which he possessed.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin had the strongest feeling of love and respect for his\r\nfather's memory. His recollection of everything that was connected with\r\nhim was peculiarly distinct, and he spoke of him frequently, generally\r\nprefacing an anecdote with some such phrase as, \"My father, who was the\r\nwisest man I ever knew,\" &c. It was astonishing how clearly he\r\nremembered his father's opinions, so that he was able to quote some\r\nmaxim or hint of his in many cases of illness. As a rule he put small\r\nfaith in doctors, and thus his unlimited belief in Dr. Darwin's medical\r\ninstinct and methods of treatment was all the more striking.\r\n\r\nHis reverence for him was boundless, and most touching. He would have\r\nwished to judge everything else in the world dispassionately, but\r\nanything his father had said was received with almost implicit faith.\r\nHis daughter, Mrs. Litchfield, remembers him saying that he hoped none\r\nof his sons would ever believe anything because he said it, unless they\r\nwere themselves convinced of its truth--a feeling in striking contrast\r\nwith his own manner of faith.\r\n\r\nA visit which Charles Darwin made to Shrewsbury in 1869 left on the mind\r\nof the daughter who accompanied him a strong impression of his love for\r\nhis old home. The tenant of the Mount at the time, showed them over the\r\nhouse, and with mistaken hospitality remained with the party during the\r\nwhole visit. As they were leaving, Charles Darwin said, with a pathetic\r\nlook of regret, \"If I could have been left alone in that green-house for\r\nfive minutes, I know I should have been able to see my father in his\r\nwheel-chair as vividly as if he had been there before me.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this incident shows what I think is the truth, that the memory\r\nof his father he loved the best, was that of him as an old man. Mrs.\r\nLitchfield has noted down a few words which illustrate well his feeling\r\ntowards his father. She describes him as saying with the most tender\r\nrespect, \"I think my father was a little unjust to me when I was young;\r\nbut afterwards, I am thankful to think I became a prime favourite with\r\nhim.\" She has a vivid recollection of the expression of happy reverie\r\nthat accompanied these words, as if he were reviewing the whole\r\nrelation, and the remembrance left a deep sense of peace and gratitude.\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin had six children, of whom none are now living: Marianne,\r\nmarried Dr. Henry Parker; Caroline, married Josiah Wedgwood; Erasmus\r\nAlvey; Susan, died unmarried; Charles Robert; Catharine, married Rev.\r\nCharles Langton.\r\n\r\nThe elder son, Erasmus, was born in 1804, and died unmarried at the age\r\nof seventy-seven.\r\n\r\nHis name, not known to the general public, may be remembered from a few\r\nwords of description occurring in Carlyle's _Reminiscences_ (vol. ii. p.\r\n208). A truer and more sympathetic sketch of his character, by his\r\ncousin, Miss Julia Wedgwood, was published in the _Spectator_, September\r\n3, 1881.\r\n\r\nThere was something pathetic in Charles Darwin's affection for his\r\nbrother Erasmus, as if he always recollected his solitary life, and the\r\ntouching patience and sweetness of his nature. He often spoke of him as\r\n\"Poor old Ras,\" or \"Poor dear old Philos.\" I imagine Philos\r\n(Philosopher) was a relic of the days when they worked at chemistry in\r\nthe tool-house at Shrewsbury--a time of which he always preserved a\r\npleasant memory. Erasmus was rather more than four years older than\r\nCharles Darwin, so that they were not long together at Cambridge, but\r\npreviously at Edinburgh they shared the same lodgings, and after the\r\nVoyage they lived for a time together in Erasmus' house in Great\r\nMarlborough Street. In later years Erasmus Darwin came to Down\r\noccasionally, or joined his brother's family in a summer holiday. But\r\ngradually it came about that he could not, through ill health, make up\r\nhis mind to leave London, and thus they only saw each other when Charles\r\nDarwin went for a week at a time to his brother's house in Queen Anne\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch of the family to which Charles Darwin belonged may\r\nperhaps suffice to introduce the reader to the autobiographical chapter\r\nwhich follows.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] See Charles Darwin's biographical sketch of his grandfather,\r\nprefixed to Ernst Krause's _Erasmus Darwin_. (Translated from the German\r\nby W. S. Dallas, 1878.) Also Miss Meteyard's _Life of Josiah Wedgwood_.\r\n\r\n[3] The above passage is, by permission of Messrs. Smith & Elder, taken\r\nfrom my article _Charles Darwin_, in the _Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_.\r\n\r\n[4] _A Group of Englishmen_, by Miss Meteyard, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAUTOBIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n     [My father's autobiographical recollections, given in the present\r\n     chapter, were written for his children,--and written without any\r\n     thought that they would ever be published. To many this may seem an\r\n     impossibility; but those who knew my father will understand how it\r\n     was not only possible, but natural. The autobiography bears the\r\n     heading, _Recollections of the Development of my Mind and\r\n     Character_, and ends with the following note:--\"Aug. 3, 1876. This\r\n     sketch of my life was begun about May 28th at Hopedene,[5] and\r\n     since then I have written for nearly an hour on most afternoons.\"\r\n     It will easily be understood that, in a narrative of a personal and\r\n     intimate kind written for his wife and children, passages should\r\n     occur which must here be omitted; and I have not thought it\r\n     necessary to indicate where such omissions are made. It has been\r\n     found necessary to make a few corrections of obvious verbal slips,\r\n     but the number of such alterations has been kept down to the\r\n     minimum.--F. D]\r\n\r\n\r\nA German Editor having written to me for an account of the development\r\nof my mind and character with some sketch of my autobiography, I have\r\nthought that the attempt would amuse me, and might possibly interest my\r\nchildren or their children. I know that it would have interested me\r\ngreatly to have read even so short and dull a sketch of the mind of my\r\ngrandfather, written by himself, and what he thought and did, and how he\r\nworked. I have attempted to write the following account of myself, as if\r\nI were a dead man in another world looking back at my own life. Nor have\r\nI found this difficult, for life is nearly over with me. I have taken no\r\npains about my style of writing.\r\n\r\nI was born at Shrewsbury on February 12th, 1809, and my earliest\r\nrecollection goes back only to when I was a few months over four years\r\nold, when we went to near Abergele for sea-bathing, and I recollect some\r\nevents and places there with some little distinctness.\r\n\r\nMy mother died in July 1817, when I was a little over eight years old,\r\nand it is odd that I can remember hardly anything about her except her\r\ndeathbed, her black velvet gown, and her curiously constructed\r\nwork-table. In the spring of this same year I was sent to a day-school\r\nin Shrewsbury, where I stayed a year. I have been told that I was much\r\nslower in learning than my younger sister Catherine, and I believe that\r\nI was in many ways a naughty boy.\r\n\r\nBy the time I went to this day-school[6] my taste for natural history,\r\nand more especially for collecting, was well developed. I tried to make\r\nout the names of plants, and collected all sorts of things, shells,\r\nseals, franks, coins, and minerals. The passion for collecting which\r\nleads a man to be a systematic naturalist, a virtuoso, or a miser, was\r\nvery strong in me, and was clearly innate, as none of my sisters or\r\nbrother ever had this taste.\r\n\r\nOne little event during this year has fixed itself very firmly in my\r\nmind, and I hope that it has done so from my conscience having been\r\nafterwards sorely troubled by it; it is curious as showing that\r\napparently I was interested at this early age in the variability of\r\nplants! I told another little boy (I believe it was Leighton,[7] who\r\nafterwards became a well-known lichenologist and botanist), that I could\r\nproduce variously coloured polyanthuses and primroses by watering them\r\nwith certain coloured fluids, which was of course a monstrous fable, and\r\nhad never been tried by me. I may here also confess that as a little boy\r\nI was much given to inventing deliberate falsehoods, and this was always\r\ndone for the sake of causing excitement. For instance, I once gathered\r\nmuch valuable fruit from my father's trees and hid it in the shrubbery,\r\nand then ran in breathless haste to spread the news that I had\r\ndiscovered a hoard of stolen fruit.[8]\r\n\r\nI must have been a very simple little fellow when I first went to the\r\nschool. A boy of the name of Garnett took me into a cake shop one day,\r\nand bought some cakes for which he did not pay, as the shopman trusted\r\nhim. When we came out I asked him why he did not pay for them, and he\r\ninstantly answered, \"Why, do you not know that my uncle left a great sum\r\nof money to the town on condition that every tradesman should give\r\nwhatever was wanted without payment to any one who wore his old hat and\r\nmoved [it] in a particular manner?\" and he then showed me how it was\r\nmoved. He then went into another shop where he was trusted, and asked\r\nfor some small article, moving his hat in the proper manner, and of\r\ncourse obtained it without payment. When we came out he said, \"Now if\r\nyou like to go by yourself into that cake-shop (how well I remember its\r\nexact position), I will lend you my hat, and you can get whatever you\r\nlike if you move the hat on your head properly.\" I gladly accepted the\r\ngenerous offer, and went in and asked for some cakes, moved the old hat,\r\nand was walking out of the shop, when the shopman made a rush at me, so\r\nI dropped the cakes and ran for dear life, and was astonished by being\r\ngreeted with shouts of laughter by my false friend Garnett.\r\n\r\nI can say in my own favour that I was as a boy humane, but I owed this\r\nentirely to the instruction and example of my sisters. I doubt indeed\r\nwhether humanity is a natural or innate quality. I was very fond of\r\ncollecting eggs, but I never took more than a single egg out of a bird's\r\nnest, except on one single occasion, when I took all, not for their\r\nvalue, but from a sort of bravado.\r\n\r\nI had a strong taste for angling, and would sit for any number of hours\r\non the bank of a river or pond watching the float; when at Maer[9] I was\r\ntold that I could kill the worms with salt and water, and from that day\r\nI never spitted a living worm, though at the expense probably of some\r\nloss of success.\r\n\r\nOnce as a very little boy whilst at the day school, or before that time,\r\nI acted cruelly, for I beat a puppy, I believe, simply from enjoying the\r\nsense of power; but the beating could not have been severe, for the\r\npuppy did not howl, of which I feel sure as the spot was near the house.\r\nThis act lay heavily on my conscience, as is shown by my remembering the\r\nexact spot where the crime was committed. It probably lay all the\r\nheavier from my love of dogs being then, and for a long time afterwards,\r\na passion. Dogs seemed to know this, for I was an adept in robbing their\r\nlove from their masters.\r\n\r\nI remember clearly only one other incident during this year whilst at\r\nMr. Case's daily school,--namely, the burial of a dragoon soldier; and\r\nit is surprising how clearly I can still see the horse with the man's\r\nempty boots and carbine suspended to the saddle, and the firing over the\r\ngrave. This scene deeply stirred whatever poetic fancy there was in\r\nme.[10]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1818 I went to Dr. Butler's great school in Shrewsbury,\r\nand remained there for seven years till Midsummer 1825, when I was\r\nsixteen years old. I boarded at this school, so that I had the great\r\nadvantage of living the life of a true schoolboy; but as the distance\r\nwas hardly more than a mile to my home, I very often ran there in the\r\nlonger intervals between the callings over and before locking up at\r\nnight. This, I think, was in many ways advantageous to me by keeping up\r\nhome affections and interests. I remember in the early part of my school\r\nlife that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and from being\r\na fleet runner was generally successful; but when in doubt I prayed\r\nearnestly to God to help me, and I well remember that I attributed my\r\nsuccess to the prayers and not to my quick running, and marvelled how\r\ngenerally I was aided.\r\n\r\nI have heard my father and elder sister say that I had, as a very young\r\nboy, a strong taste for long solitary walks; but what I thought about I\r\nknow not. I often became quite absorbed, and once, whilst returning to\r\nschool on the summit of the old fortifications round Shrewsbury, which\r\nhad been converted into a public foot-path with no parapet on one side,\r\nI walked off and fell to the ground, but the height was only seven or\r\neight feet. Nevertheless, the number of thoughts which passed through my\r\nmind during this very short, but sudden and wholly unexpected fall, was\r\nastonishing, and seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have, I\r\nbelieve, proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable amount\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been worse for the development of my mind than Dr.\r\nButler's school, as it was strictly classical, nothing else being\r\ntaught, except a little ancient geography and history. The school as a\r\nmeans of education to me was simply a blank. During my whole life I\r\nhave been singularly incapable of mastering any language. Especial\r\nattention was paid to verse-making, and this I could never do well. I\r\nhad many friends, and got together a good collection of old verses,\r\nwhich by patching together, sometimes aided by other boys, I could work\r\ninto any subject. Much attention was paid to learning by heart the\r\nlessons of the previous day; this I could effect with great facility,\r\nlearning forty or fifty lines of Virgil or Homer, whilst I was in\r\nmorning chapel; but this exercise was utterly useless, for every verse\r\nwas forgotten in forty-eight hours. I was not idle, and with the\r\nexception of versification, generally worked conscientiously at my\r\nclassics, not using cribs. The sole pleasure I ever received from such\r\nstudies, was from some of the odes of Horace, which I admired greatly.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the school I was for my age neither high nor low in it; and\r\nI believe that I was considered by all my masters and by my father as a\r\nvery ordinary boy, rather below the common standard in intellect. To my\r\ndeep mortification my father once said to me, \"You care for nothing but\r\nshooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself\r\nand all your family.\" But my father, who was the kindest man I ever\r\nknew, and whose memory I love with all my heart, must have been angry\r\nand somewhat unjust when he used such words.\r\n\r\nLooking back as well as I can at my character during my school life, the\r\nonly qualities which at this period promised well for the future, were,\r\nthat I had strong and diversified tastes, much zeal for whatever\r\ninterested me, and a keen pleasure in understanding any complex subject\r\nor thing. I was taught Euclid by a private tutor, and I distinctly\r\nremember the intense satisfaction which the clear geometrical proofs\r\ngave me. I remember with equal distinctness the delight which my uncle\r\n(the father of Francis Galton) gave me by explaining the principle of\r\nthe vernier of a barometer. With respect to diversified tastes,\r\nindependently of science, I was fond of reading various books, and I\r\nused to sit for hours reading the historical plays of Shakespeare,\r\ngenerally in an old window in the thick walls of the school. I read also\r\nother poetry, such as Thomson's _Seasons_, and the recently published\r\npoems of Byron and Scott. I mention this because later in life I wholly\r\nlost, to my great regret, all pleasure from poetry of any kind,\r\nincluding Shakespeare. In connection with pleasure from poetry, I may\r\nadd that in 1822 a vivid delight in scenery was first awakened in my\r\nmind, during a riding tour on the borders of Wales, and this has lasted\r\nlonger than any other aesthetic pleasure.\r\n\r\nEarly in my school-days a boy had a copy of the _Wonders of the World_,\r\nwhich I often read, and disputed with other boys about the veracity of\r\nsome of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a\r\nwish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled by\r\nthe voyage of the _Beagle_. In the latter part of my school life I\r\nbecame passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any one\r\ncould have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for\r\nshooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my\r\nexcitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun\r\nfrom the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became\r\na very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practice throwing up my\r\ngun to my shoulder before a looking glass to see that I threw it up\r\nstraight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a\r\nlighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if\r\nthe aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle.\r\nThe explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the\r\ntutor of the college remarked, \"What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr.\r\nDarwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I\r\noften hear the crack when I pass under his windows.\"\r\n\r\nI had many friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and I\r\nthink that my disposition was then very affectionate.\r\n\r\nWith respect to science, I continued collecting minerals with much zeal,\r\nbut quite unscientifically--all that I cared about was a new-named\r\nmineral, and I hardly attempted to classify them. I must have observed\r\ninsects with some little care, for when ten years old (1819) I went for\r\nthree weeks to Plas Edwards on the sea-coast in Wales, I was very much\r\ninterested and surprised at seeing a large black and scarlet Hemipterous\r\ninsect, many moths (Zygoena), and a Cicindela, which are not found in\r\nShropshire. I almost made up my mind to begin collecting all the insects\r\nwhich I could find dead, for on consulting my sister, I concluded that\r\nit was not right to kill insects for the sake of making a collection.\r\nFrom reading White's _Selborne_, I took much pleasure in watching the\r\nhabits of birds, and even made notes on the subject. In my simplicity, I\r\nremember wondering why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of my school life, my brother worked hard at\r\nchemistry, and made a fair laboratory with proper apparatus in the\r\ntool-house in the garden, and I was allowed to aid him as a servant in\r\nmost of his experiments. He made all the gases and many compounds, and I\r\nread with care several books on chemistry, such as Henry and Parkes'\r\n_Chemical Catechism_. The subject interested me greatly, and we often\r\nused to go on working till rather late at night. This was the best part\r\nof my education at school, for it showed me practically the meaning of\r\nexperimental science. The fact that we worked at chemistry somehow got\r\nknown at school, and as it was an unprecedented fact, I was nicknamed\r\n\"Gas.\" I was also once publicly rebuked by the head-master, Dr. Butler,\r\nfor thus wasting my time on such useless subjects; and he called me very\r\nunjustly a \"poco curante,\" and as I did not understand what he meant, it\r\nseemed to me a fearful reproach.\r\n\r\nAs I was doing no good at school, my father wisely took me away at a\r\nrather earlier age than usual, and sent me (October 1825) to\r\nEdinburgh[11] University with my brother, where I stayed for two years\r\nor sessions. My brother was completing his medical studies, though I do\r\nnot believe he ever really intended to practise, and I was sent there to\r\ncommence them. But soon after this period I became convinced from\r\nvarious small circumstances that my father would leave me property\r\nenough to subsist on with some comfort, though I never imagined that I\r\nshould be so rich a man as I am; but my belief was sufficient to check\r\nany strenuous effort to learn medicine.\r\n\r\nThe instruction at Edinburgh was altogether by lectures, and these were\r\nintolerably dull, with the exception of those on chemistry by Hope; but\r\nto my mind there are no advantages and many disadvantages in lectures\r\ncompared with reading. Dr. Duncan's lectures on Materia Medica at 8\r\no'clock on a winter's morning are something fearful to remember. Dr.\r\nMunro made his lectures on human anatomy as dull as he was himself, and\r\nthe subject disgusted me. It has proved one of the greatest evils in my\r\nlife that I was not urged to practise dissection, for I should soon have\r\ngot over my disgust, and the practice would have been invaluable for all\r\nmy future work. This has been an irremediable evil, as well as my\r\nincapacity to draw. I also attended regularly the clinical wards in the\r\nhospital. Some of the cases distressed me a good deal, and I still have\r\nvivid pictures before me of some of them; but I was not so foolish as to\r\nallow this to lessen my attendance. I cannot understand why this part of\r\nmy medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during\r\nthe summer before coming to Edinburgh, I began attending some of the\r\npoor people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as\r\nfull an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read\r\nthem aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me\r\nwhat medicines to give, which I made up myself. At one time I had at\r\nleast a dozen patients, and I felt a keen interest in the work.[12] My\r\nfather, who was by far the best judge of character whom I ever knew,\r\ndeclared that I should make a successful physician,--meaning by this,\r\none who would get many patients. He maintained that the chief element of\r\nsuccess was exciting confidence; but what he saw in me which convinced\r\nhim that I should create confidence I know not. I also attended on two\r\noccasions the operating theatre in the hospital at Edinburgh, and saw\r\ntwo very bad operations, one on a child, but I rushed away before they\r\nwere completed. Nor did I ever attend again, for hardly any inducement\r\nwould have been strong enough to make me do so; this being long before\r\nthe blessed days of chloroform. The two cases fairly haunted me for many\r\na long year.\r\n\r\nMy brother stayed only one year at the University, so that during the\r\nsecond year I was left to my own resources; and this was an advantage,\r\nfor I became well acquainted with several young men fond of natural\r\nscience. One of these was Ainsworth, who afterwards published his\r\ntravels in Assyria; he was a Wernerian geologist, and knew a little\r\nabout many subjects. Dr. Coldstream[13] was a very different young man,\r\nprim, formal, highly religious, and most kind-hearted; he afterwards\r\npublished some good zoological articles. A third young man was Hardie,\r\nwho would, I think, have made a good botanist, but died early in India.\r\nLastly, Dr. Grant, my senior by several years, but how I became\r\nacquainted with him I cannot remember; he published some first-rate\r\nzoological papers, but after coming to London as Professor in University\r\nCollege, he did nothing more in science, a fact which has always been\r\ninexplicable to me. I knew him well; he was dry and formal in manner,\r\nwith much enthusiasm beneath this outer crust. He one day, when we were\r\nwalking together, burst forth in high admiration of Lamarck and his\r\nviews on evolution. I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as I\r\ncan judge, without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the\r\n_Zoonomia_ of my grandfather, in which similar views are maintained, but\r\nwithout producing any effect on me. Nevertheless it is probable that the\r\nhearing rather early in life such views maintained and praised may have\r\nfavoured my upholding them under a different form in my _Origin of\r\nSpecies_. At this time I admired greatly the _Zoonomia_; but on reading\r\nit a second time after an interval of ten or fifteen years, I was much\r\ndisappointed; the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nDrs. Grant and Coldstream attended much to marine Zoology, and I often\r\naccompanied the former to collect animals in the tidal pools, which I\r\ndissected as well as I could. I also became friends with some of the\r\nNewhaven fishermen, and sometimes accompanied them when they trawled for\r\noysters, and thus got many specimens. But from not having had any\r\nregular practice in dissection, and from possessing only a wretched\r\nmicroscope, my attempts were very poor. Nevertheless I made one\r\ninteresting little discovery, and read, about the beginning of the year\r\n1826, a short paper on the subject before the Plinian Society. This was\r\nthat the so-called ova of Flustra had the power of independent movement\r\nby means of cilia, and were in fact larvae. In another short paper, I\r\nshowed that the little globular bodies which had been supposed to be the\r\nyoung state of _Fucus loreus_ were the egg-cases of the worm-like\r\n_Pontobdella muricata_.\r\n\r\nThe Plinian Society[14] was encouraged and, I believe, founded by\r\nProfessor Jameson: it consisted of students, and met in an underground\r\nroom in the University for the sake of reading papers on natural science\r\nand discussing them. I used regularly to attend, and the meetings had a\r\ngood effect on me in stimulating my zeal and giving me new congenial\r\nacquaintances. One evening a poor young man got up, and after stammering\r\nfor a prodigious length of time, blushing crimson, he at last slowly got\r\nout the words, \"Mr. President, I have forgotten what I was going to\r\nsay.\" The poor fellow looked quite overwhelmed, and all the members were\r\nso surprised that no one could think of a word to say to cover his\r\nconfusion. The papers which were read to our little society were not\r\nprinted, so that I had not the satisfaction of seeing my paper in\r\nprint; but I believe Dr. Grant noticed my small discovery in his\r\nexcellent memoir on Flustra.\r\n\r\nI was also a member of the Royal Medical Society, and attended pretty\r\nregularly; but as the subjects were exclusively medical, I did not much\r\ncare about them. Much rubbish was talked there, but there were some good\r\nspeakers, of whom the best was the [late] Sir J. Kay-Shuttleworth. Dr.\r\nGrant took me occasionally to the meetings of the Wernerian Society,\r\nwhere various papers on natural history were read, discussed, and\r\nafterwards published in the Transactions. I heard Audubon deliver there\r\nsome interesting discourses on the habits of N. American birds, sneering\r\nsomewhat unjustly at Waterton. By the way, a negro lived in Edinburgh,\r\nwho had travelled with Waterton, and gained his livelihood by stuffing\r\nbirds, which he did excellently: he gave me lessons for payment, and I\r\nused often to sit with him, for he was a very pleasant and intelligent\r\nman.\r\n\r\nMr. Leonard Horner also took me once to a meeting of the Royal Society\r\nof Edinburgh, where I saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as President,\r\nand he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a\r\nposition. I looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and\r\nreverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and\r\nto my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour\r\nof being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these\r\nSocieties, more than any other similar honour. If I had been told at\r\nthat time that I should one day have been thus honoured, I declare that\r\nI should have thought it as ridiculous and improbable, as if I had been\r\ntold that I should be elected King of England.\r\n\r\nDuring my second year at Edinburgh I attended Jameson's lectures on\r\nGeology and Zoology, but they were incredibly dull. The sole effect they\r\nproduced on me was the determination never as long as I lived to read a\r\nbook on Geology, or in any way to study the science. Yet I feel sure\r\nthat I was prepared for a philosophical treatment of the subject; for an\r\nold Mr. Cotton, in Shropshire, who knew a good deal about rocks, had\r\npointed out to me two or three years previously a well-known large\r\nerratic boulder in the town of Shrewsbury, called the \"bell-stone;\" he\r\ntold me that there was no rock of the same kind nearer than Cumberland\r\nor Scotland, and he solemnly assured me that the world would come to an\r\nend before any one would be able to explain how this stone came where it\r\nnow lay. This produced a deep impression on me, and I meditated over\r\nthis wonderful stone. So that I felt the keenest delight when I first\r\nread of the action of icebergs in transporting boulders, and I gloried\r\nin the progress of Geology. Equally striking is the fact that I, though\r\nnow only sixty-seven years old, heard the Professor, in a field lecture\r\nat Salisbury Craigs, discoursing on a trap-dyke, with amygdaloidal\r\nmargins and the strata indurated on each side, with volcanic rocks all\r\naround us, say that it was a fissure filled with sediment from above,\r\nadding with a sneer that there were men who maintained that it had been\r\ninjected from beneath in a molten condition. When I think of this\r\nlecture, I do not wonder that I determined never to attend to Geology.\r\n\r\nFrom attending Jameson's lectures, I became acquainted with the curator\r\nof the museum, Mr. Macgillivray, who afterwards published a large and\r\nexcellent book on the birds of Scotland. I had much interesting\r\nnatural-history talk with him, and he was very kind to me. He gave me\r\nsome rare shells, for I at that time collected marine mollusca, but with\r\nno great zeal.\r\n\r\nMy summer vacations during these two years were wholly given up to\r\namusements, though I always had some book in hand, which I read with\r\ninterest. During the summer of 1826, I took a long walking tour with two\r\nfriends with knapsacks on our backs through North Wales. We walked\r\nthirty miles most days, including one day the ascent of Snowdon. I also\r\nwent with my sister a riding tour in North Wales, a servant with\r\nsaddle-bags carrying our clothes. The autumns were devoted to shooting,\r\nchiefly at Mr. Owen's, at Woodhouse, and at my Uncle Jos's,[15] at Maer.\r\nMy zeal was so great that I used to place my shooting-boots open by my\r\nbed-side when I went to bed, so as not to lose half a minute in putting\r\nthem on in the morning; and on one occasion I reached a distant part of\r\nthe Maer estate, on the 20th of August for black-game shooting, before I\r\ncould see: I then toiled on with the gamekeeper the whole day through\r\nthick heath and young Scotch firs.\r\n\r\nI kept an exact record of every bird which I shot throughout the whole\r\nseason. One day when shooting at Woodhouse with Captain Owen, the eldest\r\nson, and Major Hill, his cousin, afterwards Lord Berwick, both of whom I\r\nliked very much, I thought myself shamefully used, for every time after\r\nI had fired and thought that I had killed a bird, one of the two acted\r\nas if loading his gun, and cried out, \"You must not count that bird, for\r\nI fired at the same time,\" and the gamekeeper, perceiving the joke,\r\nbacked them up. After some hours they told me the joke, but it was no\r\njoke to me, for I had shot a large number of birds, but did not know how\r\nmany, and could not add them to my list, which I used to do by making a\r\nknot in a piece of string tied to a button-hole. This my wicked friends\r\nhad perceived.\r\n\r\nHow I did enjoy shooting! but I think that I must have been\r\nhalf-consciously ashamed of my zeal, for I tried to persuade myself that\r\nshooting was almost an intellectual employment; it required so much\r\nskill to judge where to find most game and to hunt the dogs well.\r\n\r\nOne of my autumnal visits to Maer in 1827 was memorable from meeting\r\nthere Sir J. Mackintosh, who was the best converser I ever listened to.\r\nI heard afterwards with a glow of pride that he had said, \"There is\r\nsomething in that young man that interests me.\" This must have been\r\nchiefly due to his perceiving that I listened with much interest to\r\neverything which he said, for I was as ignorant as a pig about his\r\nsubjects of history, politics, and moral philosophy. To hear of praise\r\nfrom an eminent person, though no doubt apt or certain to excite vanity,\r\nis, I think, good for a young man, as it helps to keep him in the right\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nMy visits to Maer during these two or three succeeding years were quite\r\ndelightful, independently of the autumnal shooting. Life there was\r\nperfectly free; the country was very pleasant for walking or riding; and\r\nin the evening there was much very agreeable conversation, not so\r\npersonal as it generally is in large family parties, together with\r\nmusic. In the summer the whole family used often to sit on the steps of\r\nthe old portico with the flower-garden in front, and with the steep\r\nwooded bank opposite the house reflected in the lake, with here and\r\nthere a fish rising or a water-bird paddling about. Nothing has left a\r\nmore vivid picture on my mind than these evenings at Maer. I was also\r\nattached to and greatly revered my Uncle Jos; he was silent and\r\nreserved, so as to be a rather awful man; but he sometimes talked openly\r\nwith me. He was the very type of an upright man, with the clearest\r\njudgment. I do not believe that any power on earth could have made him\r\nswerve an inch from what he considered the right course. I used to apply\r\nto him in my mind the well-known ode of Horace, now forgotten by me, in\r\nwhich the words \"nec vultus tyranni, &c.,\"[16] come in.\r\n\r\n_Cambridge_, 1828-1831.--After having spent two sessions in Edinburgh,\r\nmy father perceived, or he heard from my sisters, that I did not like\r\nthe thought of being a physician, so he proposed that I should become a\r\nclergyman. He was very properly vehement against my turning into an idle\r\nsporting man, which then seemed my probable destination. I asked for\r\nsome time to consider, as from what little I had heard or thought on the\r\nsubject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of\r\nthe Church of England; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a\r\ncountry clergyman. Accordingly I read with great care _Pearson on the\r\nCreed_, and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the\r\nleast doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I\r\nsoon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted.\r\n\r\nConsidering how fiercely I have been attacked by the orthodox, it seems\r\nludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman. Nor was this intention\r\nand my father's wish ever formally given up, but died a natural death\r\nwhen, on leaving Cambridge, I joined the _Beagle_ as naturalist. If the\r\nphrenologists are to be trusted, I was well fitted in one respect to be\r\na clergyman. A few years ago the secretaries of a German psychological\r\nsociety asked me earnestly by letter for a photograph of myself; and\r\nsome time afterwards I received the proceedings of one of the meetings,\r\nin which it seemed that the shape of my head had been the subject of a\r\npublic discussion, and one of the speakers declared that I had the bump\r\nof reverence developed enough for ten priests.\r\n\r\nAs it was decided that I should be a clergyman, it was necessary that I\r\nshould go to one of the English universities and take a degree; but as I\r\nhad never opened a classical book since leaving school, I found to my\r\ndismay, that in the two intervening years, I had actually forgotten,\r\nincredible as it may appear, almost everything which I had learnt, even\r\nto some few of the Greek letters. I did not therefore proceed to\r\nCambridge at the usual time in October, but worked with a private tutor\r\nin Shrewsbury, and went to Cambridge after the Christmas vacation, early\r\nin 1828. I soon recovered my school standard of knowledge, and could\r\ntranslate easy Greek books, such as Homer and the Greek Testament, with\r\nmoderate facility.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years which I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted, as\r\nfar as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at\r\nEdinburgh and at school. I attempted mathematics, and even went during\r\nthe summer of 1828 with a private tutor to Barmouth, but I got on very\r\nslowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to\r\nsee any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very\r\nfoolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not\r\nproceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading\r\nprinciples of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra\r\nsense. But I do not believe that I should ever have succeeded beyond a\r\nvery low grade. With respect to Classics I did nothing except attend a\r\nfew compulsory college lectures, and the attendance was almost nominal.\r\nIn my second year I had to work for a month or two to pass the\r\nLittle-Go, which I did easily. Again, in my last year I worked with some\r\nearnestness for my final degree of B.A., and brushed up my Classics,\r\ntogether with a little Algebra and Euclid, which latter gave me much\r\npleasure, as it did at school. In order to pass the B.A. examination, it\r\nwas also necessary to get up Paley's _Evidences of Christianity_, and\r\nhis _Moral Philosophy_. This was done in a thorough manner, and I am\r\nconvinced that I could have written out the whole of the _Evidences_\r\nwith perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of\r\nPaley. The logic of this book and, as I may add, of his _Natural\r\nTheology_, gave me as much delight as did Euclid. The careful study of\r\nthese works, without attempting to learn any part by rote, was the only\r\npart of the academical course which, as I then felt, and as I still\r\nbelieve, was of the least use to me in the education of my mind. I did\r\nnot at that time trouble myself about Paley's premises; and taking these\r\non trust, I was charmed and convinced by the long line of argumentation.\r\nBy answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid\r\nwell, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place\r\namong the [Greek: oi polloi] or crowd of men who do not go in for\r\nhonours. Oddly enough, I cannot remember how high I stood, and my memory\r\nfluctuates between the fifth, tenth, or twelfth, name on the list.[17]\r\n\r\nPublic lectures on several branches were given in the University,\r\nattendance being quite voluntary; but I was so sickened with lectures at\r\nEdinburgh that I did not even attend Sedgwick's eloquent and interesting\r\nlectures. Had I done so I should probably have become a geologist\r\nearlier than I did. I attended, however, Henslow's lectures on Botany,\r\nand liked them much for their extreme clearness, and the admirable\r\nillustrations; but I did not study botany. Henslow used to take his\r\npupils, including several of the older members of the University, field,\r\nexcursions, on foot or in coaches, to distant places, or in a barge down\r\nthe river, and lectured on the rarer plants and animals which were\r\nobserved. These excursions were delightful.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we shall presently see, there were some redeeming features\r\nin my life at Cambridge, my time was sadly wasted there, and worse than\r\nwasted. From my passion for shooting and for hunting, and, when this\r\nfailed, for riding across country, I got into a sporting set, including\r\nsome dissipated low-minded young men. We used often to dine together in\r\nthe evening, though these dinners often included men of a higher stamp,\r\nand we sometimes drank too much, with jolly singing and playing at cards\r\nafterwards. I know that I ought to feel ashamed of days and evenings\r\nthus spent, but as some of my friends were very pleasant, and we were\r\nall in the highest spirits, I cannot help looking back to these times\r\nwith much pleasure.[18]\r\n\r\nBut I am glad to think that I had many other friends of a widely\r\ndifferent nature. I was very intimate with Whitley,[19] who was\r\nafterwards Senior Wrangler, and we used continually to take long walks\r\ntogether. He inoculated me with a taste for pictures and good\r\nengravings, of which I bought some. I frequently went to the Fitzwilliam\r\nGallery, and my taste must have been fairly good, for I certainly\r\nadmired the best pictures, which I discussed with the old curator. I\r\nread also with much interest Sir Joshua Reynolds' book. This taste,\r\nthough not natural to me, lasted for several years, and many of the\r\npictures in the National Gallery in London gave me much pleasure; that\r\nof Sebastian del Piombo exciting in me a sense of sublimity.\r\n\r\nI also got into a musical set, I believe by means of my warm-hearted\r\nfriend, Herbert,[20] who took a high wrangler's degree. From associating\r\nwith these men, and hearing them play, I acquired a strong taste for\r\nmusic, and used very often to time my walks so as to hear on week days\r\nthe anthem in King's College Chapel. This gave me intense pleasure, so\r\nthat my backbone would sometimes shiver. I am sure that there was no\r\naffectation or mere imitation in this taste, for I used generally to go\r\nby myself to King's College, and I sometimes hired the chorister boys to\r\nsing in my rooms. Nevertheless I am so utterly destitute of an ear, that\r\nI cannot perceive a discord, or keep time and hum a tune correctly; and\r\nit is a mystery how I could possibly have derived pleasure from music.\r\n\r\nMy musical friends soon perceived my state, and sometimes amused\r\nthemselves by making me pass an examination, which consisted in\r\nascertaining how many tunes I could recognise, when they were played\r\nrather more quickly or slowly than usual. 'God save the King,' when thus\r\nplayed, was a sore puzzle. There was another man with almost as bad an\r\near as I had, and strange to say he played a little on the flute. Once I\r\nhad the triumph of beating him in one of our musical examinations.\r\n\r\nBut no pursuit at Cambridge was followed with nearly so much eagerness\r\nor gave me so much pleasure as collecting beetles. It was the mere\r\npassion for collecting, for I did not dissect them, and rarely compared\r\ntheir external characters with published descriptions, but got them\r\nnamed anyhow. I will give a proof of my zeal: one day, on tearing off\r\nsome old bark, I saw two rare beetles, and seized one in each hand; then\r\nI saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I\r\npopped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth. Alas! it\r\nejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was\r\nforced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the third one.\r\n\r\nI was very successful in collecting, and invented two new methods; I\r\nemployed a labourer to scrape, during the winter, moss off old trees and\r\nplace it in a large bag, and likewise to collect the rubbish at the\r\nbottom of the barges in which reeds are brought from the fens, and thus\r\nI got some very rare species. No poet ever felt more delighted at seeing\r\nhis first poem published than I did at seeing, in Stephens'\r\n_Illustrations of British Insects_, the magic words, \"captured by C.\r\nDarwin, Esq.\" I was introduced to entomology by my second cousin, W.\r\nDarwin Fox, a clever and most pleasant man, who was then at Christ's\r\nCollege, and with whom I became extremely intimate. Afterwards I became\r\nwell acquainted, and went out collecting, with Albert Way of Trinity,\r\nwho in after years became a well-known archaeologist; also with H.\r\nThompson,[21] of the same College, afterwards a leading agriculturist,\r\nchairman of a great railway, and Member of Parliament. It seems,\r\ntherefore, that a taste for collecting beetles is some indication of\r\nfuture success in life!\r\n\r\nI am surprised what an indelible impression many of the beetles which I\r\ncaught at Cambridge have left on my mind. I can remember the exact\r\nappearance of certain posts, old trees and banks where I made a good\r\ncapture. The pretty _Panagaeus crux-major_ was a treasure in those days,\r\nand here at Down I saw a beetle running across a walk, and on picking it\r\nup instantly perceived that it differed slightly from _P. crux-major_,\r\nand it turned out to be _P. quadripunctatus_, which is only a variety or\r\nclosely allied species, differing from it very slightly in outline. I\r\nhad never seen in those old days Licinus alive, which to an uneducated\r\neye hardly differs from many of the black Carabidous beetles; but my\r\nsons found here a specimen, and I instantly recognised that it was new\r\nto me; yet I had not looked at a British beetle for the last twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI have not yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole career\r\nmore than any other. This was my friendship with Professor Henslow.\r\nBefore coming up to Cambridge, I had heard of him from my brother as a\r\nman who knew every branch of science, and I was accordingly prepared to\r\nreverence him. He kept open house once every week[22] when all\r\nunder-graduates and some older members of the University, who were\r\nattached to science, used to meet in the evening. I soon got, through\r\nFox, an invitation, and went there regularly. Before long I became well\r\nacquainted with Henslow, and during the latter half of my time at\r\nCambridge took long walks with him on most days; so that I was called by\r\nsome of the dons \"the man who walks with Henslow;\" and in the evening I\r\nwas very often asked to join his family dinner. His knowledge was great\r\nin botany, entomology, chemistry, mineralogy, and geology. His strongest\r\ntaste was to draw conclusions from long-continued minute observations.\r\nHis judgment was excellent, and his whole mind well-balanced; but I do\r\nnot suppose that any one would say that he possessed much original\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nHe was deeply religious, and so orthodox, that he told me one day he\r\nshould be grieved if a single word of the Thirty-nine Articles were\r\naltered. His moral qualities were in every way admirable. He was free\r\nfrom every tinge of vanity or other petty feeling; and I never saw a man\r\nwho thought so little about himself or his own concerns. His temper was\r\nimperturbably good, with the most winning and courteous manners; yet, as\r\nI have seen, he could be roused by any bad action to the warmest\r\nindignation and prompt action.\r\n\r\nI once saw in his company in the streets of Cambridge almost as horrid\r\na scene as could have been witnessed during the French Revolution. Two\r\nbody-snatchers had been arrested, and whilst being taken to prison had\r\nbeen torn from the constable by a crowd of the roughest men, who dragged\r\nthem by their legs along the muddy and stony road. They were covered\r\nfrom head to foot with mud, and their faces were bleeding either from\r\nhaving been kicked or from the stones; they looked like corpses, but the\r\ncrowd was so dense that I got only a few momentary glimpses of the\r\nwretched creatures. Never in my life have I seen such wrath painted on a\r\nman's face as was shown by Henslow at this horrid scene. He tried\r\nrepeatedly to penetrate the mob; but it was simply impossible. He then\r\nrushed away to the mayor, telling me not to follow him, but to get more\r\npolicemen. I forget the issue, except that the two men were got into the\r\nprison without being killed.\r\n\r\nHenslow's benevolence was unbounded, as he proved by his many excellent\r\nschemes for his poor parishioners, when in after years he held the\r\nliving of Hitcham. My intimacy with such a man ought to have been, and I\r\nhope was, an inestimable benefit. I cannot resist mentioning a trifling\r\nincident, which showed his kind consideration. Whilst examining some\r\npollen-grains on a damp surface, I saw the tubes exserted, and instantly\r\nrushed off to communicate my surprising discovery to him. Now I do not\r\nsuppose any other professor of botany could have helped laughing at my\r\ncoming in such a hurry to make such a communication. But he agreed how\r\ninteresting the phenomenon was, and explained its meaning, but made me\r\nclearly understand how well it was known; so I left him not in the least\r\nmortified, but well pleased at having discovered for myself so\r\nremarkable a fact, but determined not to be in such a hurry again to\r\ncommunicate my discoveries.\r\n\r\nDr. Whewell was one of the older and distinguished men who sometimes\r\nvisited Henslow, and on several occasions I walked home with him at\r\nnight. Next to Sir J. Mackintosh he was the best converser on grave\r\nsubjects to whom I ever listened. Leonard Jenyns,[23] who afterwards\r\npublished some good essays in Natural History, often stayed with\r\nHenslow, who was his brother-in-law. I visited him at his parsonage on\r\nthe borders of the Fens [Swaffham Bulbeck], and had many a good walk\r\nand talk with him about Natural History. I became also acquainted with\r\nseveral other men older than me, who did not care much about science,\r\nbut were friends of Henslow. One was a Scotchman, brother of Sir\r\nAlexander Ramsay, and tutor of Jesus College; he was a delightful man,\r\nbut did not live for many years. Another was Mr. Dawes, afterwards Dean\r\nof Hereford, and famous for his success in the education of the poor.\r\nThese men and others of the same standing, together with Henslow, used\r\nsometimes to take distant excursions into the country, which I was\r\nallowed to join, and they were most agreeable.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I infer that there must have been something in me a little\r\nsuperior to the common run of youths, otherwise the above-mentioned men,\r\nso much older than me and higher in academical position, would never\r\nhave allowed me to associate with them. Certainly I was not aware of any\r\nsuch superiority, and I remember one of my sporting friends, Turner, who\r\nsaw me at work with my beetles, saying that I should some day be a\r\nFellow of the Royal Society, and the notion seemed to me preposterous.\r\n\r\nDuring my last year at Cambridge, I read with care and profound interest\r\nHumboldt's _Personal Narrative_. This work, and Sir J. Herschel's\r\n_Introduction to the Study of Natural Philosophy_, stirred up in me a\r\nburning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble\r\nstructure of Natural Science. No one or a dozen other books influenced\r\nme nearly so much as these two. I copied out from Humboldt long passages\r\nabout Teneriffe, and read them aloud on one of the above-mentioned\r\nexcursions, to (I think) Henslow, Ramsay, and Dawes, for on a previous\r\noccasion I had talked about the glories of Teneriffe, and some of the\r\nparty declared they would endeavour to go there; but I think they were\r\nonly half in earnest. I was, however, quite in earnest, and got an\r\nintroduction to a merchant in London to enquire about ships; but the\r\nscheme was, of course, knocked on the head by the voyage of the\r\n_Beagle_.\r\n\r\nMy summer vacations were given up to collecting beetles, to some\r\nreading, and short tours. In the autumn my whole time was devoted to\r\nshooting, chiefly at Woodhouse and Maer, and sometimes with young Eyton\r\nof Eyton. Upon the whole the three years which I spent at Cambridge were\r\nthe most joyful in my happy life; for I was then in excellent health,\r\nand almost always in high spirits.\r\n\r\nAs I had at first come up to Cambridge at Christmas, I was forced to\r\nkeep two terms after passing my final examination, at the commencement\r\nof 1831; and Henslow then persuaded me to begin the study of geology.\r\nTherefore on my return to Shropshire I examined sections, and coloured a\r\nmap of parts round Shrewsbury. Professor Sedgwick intended to visit\r\nNorth Wales in the beginning of August to pursue his famous geological\r\ninvestigations amongst the older rocks, and Henslow asked him to allow\r\nme to accompany him.[24] Accordingly he came and slept at my father's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nA short conversation with him during this evening produced a strong\r\nimpression on my mind. Whilst examining an old gravel-pit near\r\nShrewsbury, a labourer told me that he had found in it a large worn\r\ntropical Volute shell, such as may be seen on chimney-pieces of\r\ncottages; and as he would not sell the shell, I was convinced that he\r\nhad really found it in the pit. I told Sedgwick of the fact, and he at\r\nonce said (no doubt truly) that it must have been thrown away by some\r\none into the pit; but then added, if really embedded there it would be\r\nthe greatest misfortune to geology, as it would overthrow all that we\r\nknow about the superficial deposits of the Midland Counties. These\r\ngravel-beds belong in fact to the glacial period, and in after years I\r\nfound in them broken arctic shells. But I was then utterly astonished at\r\nSedgwick not being delighted at so wonderful a fact as a tropical shell\r\nbeing found near the surface in the middle of England. Nothing before\r\nhad ever made me thoroughly realise, though I had read various\r\nscientific books, that science consists in grouping facts so that\r\ngeneral laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.\r\n\r\nNext morning we started for Llangollen, Conway, Bangor, and Capel Curig.\r\nThis tour was of decided use in teaching me a little how to make out the\r\ngeology of a country. Sedgwick often sent me on a line parallel to his,\r\ntelling me to bring back specimens of the rocks and to mark the\r\nstratification on a map. I have little doubt that he did this for my\r\ngood, as I was too ignorant to have aided him. On this tour I had a\r\nstriking instance how easy it is to overlook phenomena, however\r\nconspicuous, before they have been observed by any one. We spent many\r\nhours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme care, as\r\nSedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw a\r\ntrace of the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not\r\nnotice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and\r\nterminal moraines. Yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that, as I\r\ndeclared in a paper published many years afterwards in the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_,[25] a house burnt down by fire did not tell\r\nits story more plainly than did this valley. If it had still been filled\r\nby a glacier, the phenomena would have been less distinct than they now\r\nare.\r\n\r\nAt Capel Curig I left Sedgwick and went in a straight line by compass\r\nand map across the mountains to Barmouth, never following any track\r\nunless it coincided with my course. I thus came on some strange wild\r\nplaces, and enjoyed much this manner of travelling. I visited Barmouth\r\nto see some Cambridge friends who were reading there, and thence\r\nreturned to Shrewsbury and to Maer for shooting; for at that time I\r\nshould have thought myself mad to give up the first days of\r\npartridge-shooting for geology or any other science.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Voyage of the 'Beagle': from December 27, 1831, to October 2, 1836._\r\n\r\nOn returning home from my short geological tour in North Wales, I found\r\na letter from Henslow, informing me that Captain Fitz-Roy was willing to\r\ngive up part of his own cabin to any young man who would volunteer to go\r\nwith him without pay as naturalist to the Voyage of the _Beagle_. I have\r\ngiven, as I believe, in my MS. Journal an account of all the\r\ncircumstances which then occurred; I will here only say that I was\r\ninstantly eager to accept the offer, but my father strongly objected,\r\nadding the words, fortunate for me, \"If you can find any man of\r\ncommon-sense who advises you to go I will give my consent.\" So I wrote\r\nthat evening and refused the offer. On the next morning I went to Maer\r\nto be ready for September 1st, and whilst out shooting, my uncle[26]\r\nsent for me, offering to drive me over to Shrewsbury and talk with my\r\nfather, as my uncle thought it would be wise in me to accept the offer.\r\nMy father always maintained that [my uncle] was one of the most sensible\r\nmen in the world, and he at once consented in the kindest manner. I had\r\nbeen rather extravagant at Cambridge, and to console my father, said,\r\n\"that I should be deuced clever to spend more than my allowance whilst\r\non board the _Beagle_;\" but he answered with a smile, \"But they tell me\r\nyou are very clever.\"\r\n\r\nNext day I started for Cambridge to see Henslow, and thence to London\r\nto see Fitz-Roy, and all was soon arranged. Afterwards, on becoming very\r\nintimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk of\r\nbeing rejected on account of the shape of my nose! He was an ardent\r\ndisciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man's\r\ncharacter by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any one\r\nwith my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the\r\nvoyage. But I think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had\r\nspoken falsely.\r\n\r\nFitz-Roy's character was a singular one, with very many noble features:\r\nhe was devoted to his duty, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and\r\nindomitably energetic, and an ardent friend to all under his sway. He\r\nwould undertake any sort of trouble to assist those whom he thought\r\ndeserved assistance. He was a handsome man, strikingly like a gentleman,\r\nwith highly-courteous manners, which resembled those of his maternal\r\nuncle, the famous Lord Castlereagh, as I was told by the Minister at\r\nRio. Nevertheless he must have inherited much in his appearance from\r\nCharles II., for Dr. Wallich gave me a collection of photographs which\r\nhe had made, and I was struck with the resemblance of one to Fitz-Roy;\r\nand on looking at the name, I found it Ch. E. Sobieski Stuart, Count\r\nd'Albanie,[27] a descendant of the same monarch.\r\n\r\nFitz-Roy's temper was a most unfortunate one. It was usually worst in\r\nthe early morning, and with his eagle eye he could generally detect\r\nsomething amiss about the ship, and was then unsparing in his blame. He\r\nwas very kind to me, but was a man very difficult to live with on the\r\nintimate terms which necessarily followed from our messing by ourselves\r\nin the same cabin. We had several quarrels; for instance, early in the\r\nvoyage at Bahia, in Brazil, he defended and praised slavery, which I\r\nabominated, and told me that he had just visited a great slave-owner,\r\nwho had called up many of his slaves and asked them whether they were\r\nhappy, and whether they wished to be free, and all answered \"No.\" I then\r\nasked him, perhaps with a sneer, whether he thought that the answer of\r\nslaves in the presence of their master was worth anything? This made him\r\nexcessively angry, and he said that as I doubted his word we could not\r\nlive any longer together. I thought that I should have been compelled to\r\nleave the ship; but as soon as the news spread, which it did quickly,\r\nas the captain sent for the first lieutenant to assuage his anger by\r\nabusing me, I was deeply gratified by receiving an invitation from all\r\nthe gun-room officers to mess with them. But after a few hours Fitz-Roy\r\nshowed his usual magnanimity by sending an officer to me with an apology\r\nand a request that I would continue to live with him.\r\n\r\nHis character was in several respects one of the most noble which I have\r\never known.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of the _Beagle_ has been by far the most important event in\r\nmy life, and has determined my whole career; yet it depended on so small\r\na circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to\r\nShrewsbury, which few uncles would have done, and on such a trifle as\r\nthe shape of my nose. I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the\r\nfirst real training or education of my mind; I was led to attend closely\r\nto several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of\r\nobservation were improved, though they were always fairly developed.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the geology of all the places visited was far more\r\nimportant, as reasoning here comes into play. On first examining a new\r\ndistrict, nothing can appear more hopeless than the chaos of rocks; but\r\nby recording the stratification and nature of the rocks and fossils at\r\nmany points, always reasoning and predicting what will be found\r\nelsewhere, light soon begins to dawn on the district, and the structure\r\nof the whole becomes more or less intelligible. I had brought with me\r\nthe first volume of Lyell's _Principles of Geology_, which I studied\r\nattentively; and the book was of the highest service to me in many ways.\r\nThe very first place which I examined, namely, St. Jago, in the Cape de\r\nVerde islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of Lyell's\r\nmanner of treating geology, compared with that of any other author whose\r\nworks I had with me or ever afterwards read.\r\n\r\nAnother of my occupations was collecting animals of all classes, briefly\r\ndescribing and roughly dissecting many of the marine ones; but from not\r\nbeing able to draw, and from not having sufficient anatomical knowledge,\r\na great pile of MS. which I made during the voyage has proved almost\r\nuseless. I thus lost much time, with the exception of that spent in\r\nacquiring some knowledge of the Crustaceans, as this was of service when\r\nin after years I undertook a monograph of the Cirripedia.\r\n\r\nDuring some part of the day I wrote my Journal, and took much pains in\r\ndescribing carefully and vividly all that I had seen; and this was good\r\npractice. My Journal served also, in part, as letters to my home, and\r\nportions were sent to England whenever there was an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe above various special studies were, however, of no importance\r\ncompared with the habit of energetic industry and of concentrated\r\nattention to whatever I was engaged in, which I then acquired.\r\nEverything about which I thought or read was made to bear directly on\r\nwhat I had seen or was likely to see; and this habit of mind was\r\ncontinued during the five years of the voyage. I feel sure that it was\r\nthis training which has enabled me to do whatever I have done in\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nLooking backwards, I can now perceive how my love for science gradually\r\npreponderated over every other taste. During the first two years my old\r\npassion for shooting survived in nearly full force, and I shot myself\r\nall the birds and animals for my collection; but gradually I gave up my\r\ngun more and more, and finally altogether, to my servant, as shooting\r\ninterfered with my work, more especially with making out the geological\r\nstructure of a country. I discovered, though unconsciously and\r\ninsensibly, that the pleasure of observing and reasoning was a much\r\nhigher one than that of skill and sport. That my mind became developed\r\nthrough my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark\r\nmade by my father, who was the most acute observer whom I ever saw, of a\r\nsceptical disposition, and far from being a believer in phrenology; for\r\non first seeing me after the voyage, he turned round to my sisters, and\r\nexclaimed, \"Why, the shape of his head is quite altered.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the voyage. On September 11th (1831), I paid a flying visit\r\nwith Fitz-Roy to the _Beagle_ at Plymouth. Thence to Shrewsbury to wish\r\nmy father and sisters a long farewell. On October 24th I took up my\r\nresidence at Plymouth, and remained there until December 27th, when the\r\n_Beagle_ finally left the shores of England for her circumnavigation of\r\nthe world. We made two earlier attempts to sail, but were driven back\r\neach time by heavy gales. These two months at Plymouth were the most\r\nmiserable which I ever spent, though I exerted myself in various ways. I\r\nwas out of spirits at the thought of leaving all my family and friends\r\nfor so long a time, and the weather seemed to me inexpressibly gloomy. I\r\nwas also troubled with palpitation and pain about the heart, and like\r\nmany a young ignorant man, especially one with a smattering of medical\r\nknowledge, was convinced that I had heart disease. I did not consult\r\nany doctor, as I fully expected to hear the verdict that I was not fit\r\nfor the voyage, and I was resolved to go at all hazards.\r\n\r\nI need not here refer to the events of the voyage--where we went and\r\nwhat we did--as I have given a sufficiently full account in my published\r\nJournal. The glories of the vegetation of the Tropics rise before my\r\nmind at the present time more vividly than anything else; though the\r\nsense of sublimity, which the great deserts of Patagonia and the\r\nforest-clad mountains of Tierra del Fuego excited in me, has left an\r\nindelible impression on my mind. The sight of a naked savage in his\r\nnative land is an event which can never be forgotten. Many of my\r\nexcursions on horseback through wild countries, or in the boats, some of\r\nwhich lasted several weeks, were deeply interesting; their discomfort\r\nand some degree of danger were at that time hardly a drawback, and none\r\nat all afterwards. I also reflect with high satisfaction on some of my\r\nscientific work, such as solving the problem of coral islands, and\r\nmaking out the geological structure of certain islands, for instance,\r\nSt. Helena. Nor must I pass over the discovery of the singular relations\r\nof the animals and plants inhabiting the several islands of the\r\nGalapagos archipelago, and of all of them to the inhabitants of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can judge of myself, I worked to the utmost during the\r\nvoyage from the mere pleasure of investigation, and from my strong\r\ndesire to add a few facts to the great mass of facts in Natural Science.\r\nBut I was also ambitious to take a fair place among scientific\r\nmen,--whether more ambitious or less so than most of my fellow-workers,\r\nI can form no opinion.\r\n\r\nThe geology of St. Jago is very striking, yet simple: a stream of lava\r\nformerly flowed over the bed of the sea, formed of triturated recent\r\nshells and corals, which it has baked into a hard white rock. Since then\r\nthe whole island has been upheaved. But the line of white rock revealed\r\nto me a new and important fact, namely, that there had been afterwards\r\nsubsidence round the craters, which had since been in action, and had\r\npoured forth lava. It then first dawned on me that I might perhaps write\r\na book on the geology of the various countries visited, and this made me\r\nthrill with delight. That was a memorable hour to me, and how distinctly\r\nI can call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which I rested, with\r\nthe sun glaring hot, a few strange desert plants growing near, and with\r\nliving corals in the tidal pools at my feet. Later in the voyage,\r\nFitz-Roy asked me to read some of my Journal, and declared it would be\r\nworth publishing; so here was a second book in prospect!\r\n\r\nTowards the close of our voyage I received a letter whilst at Ascension,\r\nin which my sisters told me that Sedgwick had called on my father, and\r\nsaid that I should take a place among the leading scientific men. I\r\ncould not at the time understand how he could have learnt anything of my\r\nproceedings, but I heard (I believe afterwards) that Henslow had read\r\nsome of the letters which I wrote to him before the Philosophical\r\nSociety of Cambridge,[28] and had printed them for private distribution.\r\nMy collection of fossil bones, which had been sent to Henslow, also\r\nexcited considerable attention amongst palaeontologists. After reading\r\nthis letter, I clambered over the mountains of Ascension with a bounding\r\nstep and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer. All\r\nthis shows how ambitious I was; but I think that I can say with truth\r\nthat in after years, though I cared in the highest degree for the\r\napprobation of such men as Lyell and Hooker, who were my friends, I did\r\nnot care much about the general public. I do not mean to say that a\r\nfavourable review or a large sale of my books did not please me greatly,\r\nbut the pleasure was a fleeting one, and I am sure that I have never\r\nturned one inch out of my course to gain fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my return to England (October 2, 1836) to my marriage (January 29,\r\n1839)._\r\n\r\nThese two years and three months wore the most active ones which I ever\r\nspent, though I was occasionally unwell, and so lost some time. After\r\ngoing backwards and forwards several times between Shrewsbury, Maer,\r\nCambridge, and London, I settled in lodgings at Cambridge[29] on\r\nDecember 13th, where all my collections were under the care of Henslow.\r\nI stayed here three months, and got my minerals and rocks examined by\r\nthe aid of Professor Miller.\r\n\r\nI began preparing my _Journal of Travels_, which was not hard work, as\r\nmy MS. Journal had been written with care, and my chief labour was\r\nmaking an abstract of my more interesting scientific results. I sent\r\nalso, at the request of Lyell, a short account of my observations on the\r\nelevation of the coast of Chili to the Geological Society.[30]\r\n\r\nOn March 7th, 1837, I took lodgings in Great Marlborough Street in\r\nLondon, and remained there for nearly two years, until I was married.\r\nDuring these two years I finished my Journal, read several papers before\r\nthe Geological Society, began preparing the MS. for my _Geological\r\nObservations_, and arranged for the publication of the _Zoology of the\r\nVoyage of the Beagle_. In July I opened my first note-book for facts in\r\nrelation to the _Origin of Species_, about which I had long reflected,\r\nand never ceased working for the next twenty years.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years I also went a little into society, and acted as\r\none of the honorary secretaries of the Geological Society. I saw a great\r\ndeal of Lyell. One of his chief characteristics was his sympathy with\r\nthe work of others, and I was as much astonished as delighted at the\r\ninterest which he showed when, on my return to England, I explained to\r\nhim my views on coral reefs. This encouraged me greatly, and his advice\r\nand example had much influence on me. During this time I saw also a good\r\ndeal of Robert Brown; I used often to call and sit with him during his\r\nbreakfast on Sunday mornings, and he poured forth a rich treasure of\r\ncurious observations and acute remarks, but they almost always related\r\nto minute points, and he never with me discussed large or general\r\nquestions in science.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years I took several short excursions as a relaxation,\r\nand one longer one to the parallel roads of Glen Roy, an account of\r\nwhich was published in the _Philosophical Transactions_.[31] This paper\r\nwas a great failure, and I am ashamed of it. Having been deeply\r\nimpressed with what I had seen of the elevation of the land in South\r\nAmerica, I attributed the parallel lines to the action of the sea; but I\r\nhad to give up this view when Agassiz propounded his glacier-lake\r\ntheory. Because no other explanation was possible under our then state\r\nof knowledge, I argued in favour of sea-action; and my error has been a\r\ngood lesson to me never to trust in science to the principle of\r\nexclusion.\r\n\r\nAs I was not able to work all day at science, I read a good deal during\r\nthese two years on various subjects, including some metaphysical books;\r\nbut I was not well fitted for such studies. About this time I took much\r\ndelight in Wordsworth's and Coleridge's poetry; and can boast that I\r\nread the _Excursion_ twice through. Formerly Milton's _Paradise Lost_\r\nhad been my chief favourite, and in my excursions during the voyage of\r\nthe _Beagle_, when I could take only a single volume, I always chose\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my marriage, January 29, 1839, and residence in Upper Gower\r\nStreet, to our leaving London and settling at Down, September 14, 1842._\r\n\r\n[After speaking of his happy married life, and of his children, he\r\ncontinues:]\r\n\r\nDuring the three years and eight months whilst we resided in London, I\r\ndid less scientific work, though I worked as hard as I possibly could,\r\nthan during any other equal length of time in my life. This was owing to\r\nfrequently recurring unwellness, and to one long and serious illness.\r\nThe greater part of my time, when I could do anything, was devoted to my\r\nwork on _Coral Reefs_, which I had begun before my marriage, and of\r\nwhich the last proof-sheet was corrected on May 6th, 1842. This book,\r\nthough a small one, cost me twenty months of hard work, as I had to read\r\nevery work on the islands of the Pacific and to consult many charts. It\r\nwas thought highly of by scientific men, and the theory therein given\r\nis, I think, now well established.\r\n\r\nNo other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this, for\r\nthe whole theory was thought out on the west coast of South America,\r\nbefore I had seen a true coral reef. I had therefore only to verify and\r\nextend my views by a careful examination of living reefs. But it should\r\nbe observed that I had during the two previous years been incessantly\r\nattending to the effects on the shores of South America of the\r\nintermittent elevation of the land, together with denudation and the\r\ndeposition of sediment. This necessarily led me to reflect much on the\r\neffects of subsidence, and it was easy to replace in imagination the\r\ncontinued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals. To do\r\nthis was to form my theory of the formation of barrier-reefs and atolls.\r\n\r\nBesides my work on coral-reefs, during my residence in London, I read\r\nbefore the Geological Society papers on the Erratic Boulders of South\r\nAmerica,[32] on Earthquakes,[33] and on the Formation by the Agency of\r\nEarth-worms of Mould.[34] I also continued to superintend the\r\npublication of the _Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle_. Nor did I ever\r\nintermit collecting facts bearing on the origin of species; and I could\r\nsometimes do this when I could do nothing else from illness.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1842 I was stronger than I had been for some time, and\r\ntook a little tour by myself in North Wales, for the sake of observing\r\nthe effects of the old glaciers which formerly filled all the larger\r\nvalleys. I published a short account of what I saw in the _Philosophical\r\nMagazine_.[35] This excursion interested me greatly, and it was the last\r\ntime I was ever strong enough to climb mountains or to take long walks\r\nsuch as are necessary for geological work.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of our life in London, I was strong enough to go\r\ninto general society, and saw a good deal of several scientific men and\r\nother more or less distinguished men. I will give my impressions with\r\nrespect to some of them, though I have little to say worth saying.\r\n\r\nI saw more of Lyell than of any other man, both before and after my\r\nmarriage. His mind was characterised, as it appeared to me, by\r\nclearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality. When\r\nI made any remark to him on Geology, he never rested until he saw the\r\nwhole case clearly, and often made me see it more clearly than I had\r\ndone before. He would advance all possible objections to my suggestion,\r\nand even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious. A second\r\ncharacteristic was his hearty sympathy with the work of other scientific\r\nmen.[36]\r\n\r\nOn my return from the voyage of the _Beagle_, I explained to him my\r\nviews on coral-reefs, which differed from his, and I was greatly\r\nsurprised and encouraged by the vivid interest which he showed. His\r\ndelight in science was ardent, and he felt the keenest interest in the\r\nfuture progress of mankind. He was very kind-hearted, and thoroughly\r\nliberal in his religious beliefs, or rather disbeliefs; but he was a\r\nstrong theist. His candour was highly remarkable. He exhibited this by\r\nbecoming a convert to the Descent theory, though he had gained much fame\r\nby opposing Lamarck's views, and this after he had grown old. He\r\nreminded me that I had many years before said to him, when discussing\r\nthe opposition of the old school of geologists to his new views, \"What a\r\ngood thing it would be if every scientific man was to die when sixty\r\nyears old, as afterwards he would be sure to oppose all new doctrines.\"\r\nBut he hoped that now he might be allowed to live.\r\n\r\nThe science of Geology is enormously indebted to Lyell--more so, as I\r\nbelieve, than to any other man who ever lived. When [I was] starting on\r\nthe voyage of the _Beagle_, the sagacious Henslow, who, like all other\r\ngeologists, believed at that time in successive cataclysms, advised me\r\nto get and study the first volume of the _Principles_, which had then\r\njust been published, but on no account to accept the views therein\r\nadvocated. How differently would any one now speak of the _Principles_!\r\nI am proud to remember that the first place, namely, St. Jago, in the\r\nCape de Verde Archipelago, in which I geologised, convinced me of the\r\ninfinite superiority of Lyell's views over those advocated in any other\r\nwork known to me.\r\n\r\nThe powerful effects of Lyell's works could formerly be plainly seen in\r\nthe different progress of the science in France and England. The present\r\ntotal oblivion of Elie de Beaumont's wild hypotheses, such as his\r\n_Craters of Elevation_ and _Lines of Elevation_ (which latter hypothesis\r\nI heard Sedgwick at the Geological Society lauding to the skies), may be\r\nlargely attributed to Lyell.\r\n\r\nI saw a good deal of Robert Brown, \"facile Princeps Botanicorum,\" as he\r\nwas called by Humboldt. He seemed to me to be chiefly remarkable for the\r\nminuteness of his observations and their perfect accuracy. His knowledge\r\nwas extraordinarily great, and much died with him, owing to his\r\nexcessive fear of ever making a mistake. He poured out his knowledge to\r\nme in the most unreserved manner, yet was strangely jealous on some\r\npoints. I called on him two or three times before the voyage of the\r\n_Beagle_, and on one occasion he asked me to look through a microscope\r\nand describe what I saw. This I did, and believe now that it was the\r\nmarvellous currents of protoplasm in some vegetable cell. I then asked\r\nhim what I had seen; but he answered me, \"That is my little secret.\"\r\n\r\nHe was capable of the most generous actions. When old, much out of\r\nhealth, and quite unfit for any exertion, he daily visited (as Hooker\r\ntold me) an old man-servant, who lived at a distance (and whom he\r\nsupported), and read aloud to him. This is enough to make up for any\r\ndegree of scientific penuriousness or jealousy.\r\n\r\nI may here mention a few other eminent men whom I have occasionally\r\nseen, but I have little to say about them worth saying. I felt a high\r\nreverence for Sir J. Herschel, and was delighted to dine with him at his\r\ncharming house at the Cape of Good Hope and afterwards at his London\r\nhouse. I saw him, also, on a few other occasions. He never talked much,\r\nbut every word which he uttered was worth listening to.\r\n\r\nI once met at breakfast, at Sir R. Murchison's house, the illustrious\r\nHumboldt, who honoured me by expressing a wish to see me. I was a little\r\ndisappointed with the great man, but my anticipations probably were too\r\nhigh. I can remember nothing distinctly about our interview, except\r\nthat Humboldt was very cheerful and talked much.\r\n\r\nX.[37] reminds me of Buckle, whom I once met at Hensleigh Wedgwood's. I\r\nwas very glad to learn from [Buckle] his system of collecting facts. He\r\ntold me that he bought all the books which he read, and made a full\r\nindex to each, of the facts which he thought might prove serviceable to\r\nhim, and that he could always remember in what book he had read\r\nanything, for his memory was wonderful. I asked him how at first he\r\ncould judge what facts would be serviceable, and he answered that he did\r\nnot know, but that a sort of instinct guided him. From this habit of\r\nmaking indices, he was enabled to give the astonishing number of\r\nreferences on all sorts of subjects which may be found in his _History\r\nof Civilisation_. This book I thought most interesting, and read it\r\ntwice, but I doubt whether his generalisations are worth anything.\r\nBuckle was a great talker; and I listened to him, saying hardly a word,\r\nnor indeed could I have done so, for he left no gaps. When Mrs. Farrer\r\nbegan to sing, I jumped up and said that I must listen to her. After I\r\nhad moved away, he turned round to a friend, and said (as was overheard\r\nby my brother), \"Well, Mr. Darwin's books are much better than his\r\nconversation.\"\r\n\r\nOf other great literary men, I once met Sydney Smith at Dean Milman's\r\nhouse. There was something inexplicably amusing in every word which he\r\nuttered. Perhaps this was partly due to the expectation of being amused.\r\nHe was talking about Lady Cork, who was then extremely old. This was the\r\nlady who, as he said, was once so much affected by one of his charity\r\nsermons, that she _borrowed_ a guinea from a friend to put in the plate.\r\nHe now said, \"It is generally believed that my dear old friend Lady Cork\r\nhas been overlooked\"; and he said this in such a manner that no one\r\ncould for a moment doubt that he meant that his dear old friend had been\r\noverlooked by the devil. How he managed to express this I know not.\r\n\r\nI likewise once met Macaulay at Lord Stanhope's (the historian's) house,\r\nand as there was only one other man at dinner, I had a grand opportunity\r\nof hearing him converse, and he was very agreeable. He did not talk at\r\nall too much, nor indeed could such a man talk too much, as long as he\r\nallowed others to turn the stream of his conversation, and this he did\r\nallow.\r\n\r\nLord Stanhope once gave me a curious little proof of the accuracy and\r\nfulness of Macaulay's memory. Many historians used often to meet at\r\nLord Stanhope's house; and, in discussing various subjects, they would\r\nsometimes differ from Macaulay, and formerly they often referred to some\r\nbook to see who was right; but latterly, as Lord Stanhope noticed, no\r\nhistorian ever took this trouble, and whatever Macaulay said was final.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I met at Lord Stanhope's house one of his parties of\r\nhistorians and other literary men, and amongst them were Motley and\r\nGrote. After luncheon I walked about Chevening Park for nearly an hour\r\nwith Grote, and was much interested by his conversation and pleased by\r\nthe simplicity and absence of all pretension in his manners.\r\n\r\nLong ago I dined occasionally with the old Earl, the father of the\r\nhistorian. He was a strange man, but what little I knew of him I liked\r\nmuch. He was frank, genial, and pleasant. He had strongly-marked\r\nfeatures, with a brown complexion, and his clothes, when I saw him, were\r\nall brown. He seemed to believe in everything which was to others\r\nutterly incredible. He said one day to me, \"Why don't you give up your\r\nfiddle-faddle of geology and zoology, and turn to the occult sciences?\"\r\nThe historian, then Lord Mahon, seemed shocked at such a speech to me,\r\nand his charming wife much amused.\r\n\r\nThe last man whom I will mention is Carlyle, seen by me several times at\r\nmy brother's house and two or three times at my own house. His talk was\r\nvery racy and interesting, just like his writings, but he sometimes went\r\non too long on the same subject. I remember a funny dinner at my\r\nbrother's, where, amongst a few others, were Babbage and Lyell, both of\r\nwhom liked to talk. Carlyle, however, silenced every one by haranguing\r\nduring the whole dinner on the advantages of silence. After dinner,\r\nBabbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very\r\ninteresting lecture on silence.\r\n\r\nCarlyle sneered at almost every one: One day in my house he called\r\nGrote's _History_ \"a fetid quagmire, with nothing spiritual about it.\" I\r\nalways thought, until his _Reminiscences_ appeared, that his sneers were\r\npartly jokes, but this now seems rather doubtful. His expression was\r\nthat of a depressed, almost despondent, yet benevolent man, and it is\r\nnotorious how heartily he laughed. I believe that his benevolence was\r\nreal, though stained by not a little jealousy. No one can doubt about\r\nhis extraordinary power of drawing pictures of things and men--far more\r\nvivid, as it appears to me, than any drawn by Macaulay. Whether his\r\npictures of men were true ones is another question.\r\n\r\nHe has been all-powerful in impressing some grand moral truths on the\r\nminds of men. On the other hand, his views about slavery were\r\nrevolting. In his eyes might was right. His mind seemed to me a very\r\nnarrow one; even if all branches of science, which he despised, are\r\nexcluded. It is astonishing to me that Kingsley should have spoken of\r\nhim as a man well fitted to advance science. He laughed to scorn the\r\nidea that a mathematician, such as Whewell, could judge, as I maintained\r\nhe could, of Goethe's views on light. He thought it a most ridiculous\r\nthing that any one should care whether a glacier moved a little quicker\r\nor a little slower, or moved at all. As far as I could judge, I never\r\nmet a man with a mind so ill adapted for scientific research.\r\n\r\nWhilst living in London, I attended as regularly as I could the meetings\r\nof several scientific societies, and acted as secretary to the\r\nGeological Society. But such attendance, and ordinary society, suited my\r\nhealth so badly that we resolved to live in the country, which we both\r\npreferred and have never repented of.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Residence at Down, from September 14, 1842, to the present time, 1876._\r\n\r\nAfter several fruitless searches in Surrey and elsewhere, we found this\r\nhouse and purchased it. I was pleased with the diversified appearance of\r\nthe vegetation proper to a chalk district, and so unlike what I had been\r\naccustomed to in the Midland counties; and still more pleased with the\r\nextreme quietness and rusticity of the place. It is not, however, quite\r\nso retired a place as a writer in a German periodical makes it, who says\r\nthat my house can be approached only by a mule-track! Our fixing\r\nourselves here has answered admirably in one way which we did not\r\nanticipate, namely, by being very convenient for frequent visits from\r\nour children.\r\n\r\nFew persons can have lived a more retired life than we have done.\r\nBesides short visits to the houses of relations, and occasionally to the\r\nseaside or elsewhere, we have gone nowhere. During the first part of our\r\nresidence we went a little into society, and received a few friends\r\nhere; but my health almost always suffered from the excitement, violent\r\nshivering and vomiting attacks being thus brought on. I have therefore\r\nbeen compelled for many years to give up all dinner-parties; and this\r\nhas been somewhat of a deprivation to me, as such parties always put me\r\ninto high spirits. From the same cause I have been able to invite here\r\nvery few scientific acquaintances.\r\n\r\nMy chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has been\r\nscientific work, and the excitement from such work makes me for the time\r\nforget, or drives quite away, my daily discomfort. I have therefore\r\nnothing to record during the rest of my life, except the publication of\r\nmy several books. Perhaps a few details how they arose may be worth\r\ngiving.\r\n\r\n_My several Publications._--In the early part of 1844, my observations\r\non the volcanic islands visited during the voyage of the _Beagle_ were\r\npublished. In 1845, I took much pains in correcting a new edition of my\r\n_Journal of Researches_, which was originally published in 1839 as part\r\nof Fitz-Roy's work. The success of this my first literary child always\r\ntickles my vanity more than that of any of my other books. Even to this\r\nday it sells steadily in England and the United States, and has been\r\ntranslated for the second time into German, and into French and other\r\nlanguages. This success of a book of travels, especially of a scientific\r\none, so many years after its first publication, is surprising. Ten\r\nthousand copies have been sold in England of the second edition. In 1846\r\nmy _Geological Observations on South America_ were published. I record\r\nin a little diary, which I have always kept, that my three geological\r\nbooks (_Coral Reefs_ included) consumed four and a half years' steady\r\nwork; \"and now it is ten years since my return to England. How much time\r\nhave I lost by illness?\" I have nothing to say about these three books\r\nexcept that to my surprise new editions have lately been called for.[38]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1846, I began to work on 'Cirripedia' (Barnacles). When on\r\nthe coast of Chile, I found a most curious form, which burrowed into\r\nshells of Concholepas, and which differed so much from all other\r\nCirripedes that I had to form a new sub-order for its sole reception.\r\nLately an allied burrowing genus has been found on the shores of\r\nPortugal. To understand the structure of my new Cirripede I had to\r\nexamine and dissect many of the common forms: and this gradually led me\r\non to take up the whole group. I worked steadily on the subject for the\r\nnext eight years, and ultimately published two thick volumes,[39]\r\ndescribing all the known living species, and two thin quartos on the\r\nextinct species. I do not doubt that Sir E. Lytton Bulwer had me in his\r\nmind when he introduced in one of his novels a Professor Long, who had\r\nwritten two huge volumes on limpets.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was employed during eight years on this work, yet I record in\r\nmy diary that about two years out of this time was lost by illness. On\r\nthis account I went in 1848 for some months to Malvern for hydropathic\r\ntreatment, which did me much good, so that on my return home I was able\r\nto resume work. So much was I out of health that when my dear father\r\ndied on November 13th, 1848, I was unable to attend his funeral or to\r\nact as one of his executors.\r\n\r\nMy work on the Cirripedia possesses, I think, considerable value, as\r\nbesides describing several new and remarkable forms, I made out the\r\nhomologies of the various parts--I discovered the cementing apparatus,\r\nthough I blundered dreadfully about the cement glands--and lastly I\r\nproved the existence in certain genera of minute males complemental to\r\nand parasitic on the hermaphrodites. This latter discovery has at last\r\nbeen fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to\r\nattribute the whole account to my fertile imagination. The Cirripedes\r\nform a highly varying and difficult group of species to class; and my\r\nwork was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the _Origin\r\nof Species_ the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless, I\r\ndoubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.\r\n\r\nFrom September 1854 I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge pile of\r\nnotes, to observing, and to experimenting in relation to the\r\ntransmutation of species. During the voyage of the _Beagle_ I had been\r\ndeeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil\r\nanimals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos;\r\nsecondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one\r\nanother in proceeding southwards over the Continent; and thirdly, by the\r\nSouth American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos\r\narchipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they differ\r\nslightly on each island of the group; none of the islands appearing to\r\nbe very ancient in a geological sense.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that such facts as these, as well as many others, could\r\nonly be explained on the supposition that species gradually become\r\nmodified; and the subject haunted me. But it was equally evident that\r\nneither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the\r\norganisms (especially in the case of plants) could account for the\r\ninnumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully\r\nadapted to their habits of life--for instance, a woodpecker or a\r\ntree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes. I\r\nhad always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these could\r\nbe explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by\r\nindirect evidence that species have been modified.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to England it appeared to me that by following the\r\nexample of Lyell in Geology, and by collecting all facts which bore in\r\nany way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and\r\nnature, some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject. My\r\nfirst note-book was opened in July 1837. I worked on true Baconian\r\nprinciples, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale,\r\nmore especially with respect to domesticated productions, by printed\r\nenquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners, and by\r\nextensive reading. When I see the list of books of all kinds which I\r\nread and abstracted, including whole series of Journals and\r\nTransactions, I am surprised at my industry. I soon perceived that\r\nselection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of\r\nanimals and plants. But how selection could be applied to organisms\r\nliving in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me.\r\n\r\nIn October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic\r\nenquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on _Population_, and\r\nbeing well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which\r\neverywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of\r\nanimals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances\r\nfavourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones\r\nto be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new\r\nspecies. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work; but I\r\nwas so anxious to avoid prejudice, that I determined not for some time\r\nto write even the briefest sketch of it. In June 1842 I first allowed\r\nmyself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in\r\npencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into\r\none of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and still possess.\r\n\r\nBut at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it is\r\nastonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg, how\r\nI could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the\r\ntendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in\r\ncharacter as they become modified. That they have diverged greatly is\r\nobvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed\r\nunder genera, genera under families, families under sub-orders, and so\r\nforth; and I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst in my\r\ncarriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this was long\r\nafter I had come to Down. The solution, as I believe, is that the\r\nmodified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become\r\nadapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and\r\nI began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as\r\nthat which was afterwards followed in my _Origin of Species_; yet it was\r\nonly an abstract of the materials which I had collected, and I got\r\nthrough about half the work on this scale. But my plans were overthrown,\r\nfor early in the summer of 1858 Mr. Wallace, who was then in the Malay\r\narchipelago, sent me an essay _On the Tendency of Varieties to depart\r\nindefinitely from the Original Type_; and this essay contained exactly\r\nthe same theory as mine. Mr. Wallace expressed the wish that if I\r\nthought well of his essay, I should send it to Lyell for perusal.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which I consented at the request of Lyell and\r\nHooker to allow of an abstract from my MS., together with a letter to\r\nAsa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, to be published at the same time with\r\nWallace's Essay, are given in the _Journal of the Proceedings of the\r\nLinnean Society_, 1858, p. 45. I was at first very unwilling to consent,\r\nas I thought Mr. Wallace might consider my doing so unjustifiable, for I\r\ndid not then know how generous and noble was his disposition. The\r\nextract from my MS. and the letter to Asa Gray had neither been intended\r\nfor publication, and were badly written. Mr. Wallace's essay, on the\r\nother hand, was admirably expressed and quite clear. Nevertheless, our\r\njoint productions excited very little attention, and the only published\r\nnotice of them which I can remember was by Professor Haughton of Dublin,\r\nwhose verdict was that all that was new in them was false, and what was\r\ntrue was old. This shows how necessary it is that any new view should be\r\nexplained at considerable length in order to arouse public attention.\r\n\r\nIn September 1858 I set to work by the strong advice of Lyell and Hooker\r\nto prepare a volume on the transmutation of species, but was often\r\ninterrupted by ill-health, and short visits to Dr. Lane's delightful\r\nhydropathic establishment at Moor Park. I abstracted the MS. begun on a\r\nmuch larger scale in 1856, and completed the volume on the same reduced\r\nscale. It cost me thirteen months and ten days' hard labour. It was\r\npublished under the title of the _Origin of Species_, in November 1859.\r\nThough considerably added to and corrected in the later editions, it has\r\nremained substantially the same book.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt the chief work of my life. It was from the first highly\r\nsuccessful. The first small edition of 1250 copies was sold on the day\r\nof publication, and a second edition of 3000 copies soon afterwards.\r\nSixteen thousand copies have now (1876) been sold in England; and\r\nconsidering how stiff a book it is, this is a large sale. It has been\r\ntranslated into almost every European tongue, even into such languages\r\nas Spanish, Bohemian, Polish, and Russian. It has also, according to\r\nMiss Bird, been translated into Japanese,[40] and is there much studied.\r\nEven an essay in Hebrew has appeared on it, showing that the theory is\r\ncontained in the Old Testament! The reviews were very numerous; for some\r\ntime I collected all that appeared on the _Origin_ and on my related\r\nbooks, and these amount (excluding newspaper reviews) to 265; but after\r\na time I gave up the attempt in despair. Many separate essays and books\r\non the subject have appeared; and in Germany a catalogue or bibliography\r\non \"Darwinismus\" has appeared every year or two.\r\n\r\nThe success of the _Origin_ may, I think, be attributed in large part to\r\nmy having long before written two condensed sketches, and to my having\r\nfinally abstracted a much larger manuscript, which was itself an\r\nabstract. By this means I was enabled to select the more striking facts\r\nand conclusions. I had, also, during many years, followed a golden rule,\r\nnamely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought\r\ncame across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a\r\nmemorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience\r\nthat such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory\r\nthan favourable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were\r\nraised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said that the success of the _Origin_ proved \"that\r\nthe subject was in the air,\" or \"that men's minds were prepared for it.\"\r\nI do not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally sounded\r\nnot a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a single one\r\nwho seemed to doubt about the permanence of species. Even Lyell and\r\nHooker, though they would listen with interest to me, never seemed to\r\nagree. I tried once or twice to explain to able men what I meant by\r\nNatural selection, but signally failed. What I believe was strictly true\r\nis that innumerable well-observed facts were stored in the minds of\r\nnaturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as any theory\r\nwhich would receive them was sufficiently explained. Another element in\r\nthe success of the book was its moderate size; and this I owe to the\r\nappearance of Mr. Wallace's essay; had I published on the scale in\r\nwhich I began to write in 1856, the book would have been four or five\r\ntimes as large as the _Origin_, and very few would have had the patience\r\nto read it.\r\n\r\nI gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory\r\nwas clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I cared\r\nvery little whether men attributed most originality to me or Wallace;\r\nand his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory. I was\r\nforestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always made\r\nme regret, namely, the explanation by means of the Glacial period of the\r\npresence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on\r\ndistant mountain summits and in the arctic regions. This view pleased me\r\nso much that I wrote it out _in extenso_, and I believe that it was read\r\nby Hooker some years before E. Forbes published his celebrated\r\nmemoir[41] on the subject. In the very few points in which we differed,\r\nI still think that I was in the right. I have never, of course, alluded\r\nin print to my having independently worked out this view.\r\n\r\nHardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when I was at work on the\r\n_Origin_, as the explanation of the wide difference in many classes\r\nbetween the embryo and the adult animal, and of the close resemblance of\r\nthe embryos within the same class. No notice of this point was taken, as\r\nfar as I remember, in the early reviews of the _Origin_, and I recollect\r\nexpressing my surprise on this head in a letter to Asa Gray. Within late\r\nyears several reviewers have given the whole credit to Fritz Mueller and\r\nHaeckel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully, and in some\r\nrespects more correctly than I did. I had materials for a whole chapter\r\non the subject, and I ought to have made the discussion longer; for it\r\nis clear that I failed to impress my readers; and he who succeeds in\r\ndoing so deserves, in my opinion, all the credit.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to remark that I have almost always been treated honestly\r\nby my reviewers, passing over those without scientific knowledge as not\r\nworthy of notice. My views have often been grossly misrepresented,\r\nbitterly opposed and ridiculed, but this has been generally done, as I\r\nbelieve, in good faith. On the whole I do not doubt that my works have\r\nbeen over and over again greatly overpraised. I rejoice that I have\r\navoided controversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who many years ago, in\r\nreference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get\r\nentangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a\r\nmiserable loss of time and temper.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have found out that I have blundered, or that my work has\r\nbeen imperfect, and when I have been contemptuously criticised, and even\r\nwhen I have been overpraised, so that I have felt mortified, it has been\r\nmy greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself that \"I have\r\nworked as hard and as well as I could, and no man can do more than\r\nthis.\" I remember when in Good Success Bay, in Tierra del Fuego,\r\nthinking (and, I believe, that I wrote home to the effect) that I could\r\nnot employ my life better than in adding a little to Natural Science.\r\nThis I have done to the best of my abilities, and critics may say what\r\nthey like, but they cannot destroy this conviction.\r\n\r\nDuring the two last months of 1859 I was fully occupied in preparing a\r\nsecond edition of the _Origin_, and by an enormous correspondence. On\r\nJanuary 1st, 1860, I began arranging my notes for my work on the\r\n_Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication_; but it was not\r\npublished until the beginning of 1868; the delay having been caused\r\npartly by frequent illnesses, one of which lasted seven months, and\r\npartly by being tempted to publish on other subjects which at the time\r\ninterested me more.\r\n\r\nOn May 15th, 1862, my little book on the _Fertilisation of Orchids_,\r\nwhich cost me ten months' work, was published: most of the facts had\r\nbeen slowly accumulated during several previous years. During the summer\r\nof 1839, and, I believe, during the previous summer, I was led to attend\r\nto the cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from having\r\ncome to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species, that\r\ncrossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant. I\r\nattended to the subject more or less during every subsequent summer; and\r\nmy interest in it was greatly enhanced by having procured and read in\r\nNovember 1841, through the advice of Robert Brown, a copy of C. K.\r\nSprengel's wonderful book, _Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur_. For\r\nsome years before 1862 I had specially attended to the fertilisation of\r\nour British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as\r\ncomplete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I could, rather\r\nthan to utilise the great mass of matter which I had slowly collected\r\nwith respect to other plants.\r\n\r\nMy resolve proved a wise one; for since the appearance of my book, a\r\nsurprising number of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of\r\nall kinds of flowers have appeared; and these are far better done than I\r\ncould possibly have effected. The merits of poor old Sprengel, so long\r\noverlooked, are now fully recognised many years after his death.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year I published in the _Journal of the Linnean\r\nSociety_, a paper _On the Two Forms, or Dimorphic Condition of Primula_,\r\nand during the next five years, five other papers on dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants. I do not think anything in my scientific life has\r\ngiven me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the structure\r\nof these plants. I had noticed in 1838 or 1839 the dimorphism of _Linum\r\nflavum_, and had at first thought that it was merely a case of unmeaning\r\nvariability. But on examining the common species of Primula, I found\r\nthat the two forms were much too regular and constant to be thus viewed.\r\nI therefore became almost convinced that the common cowslip and primrose\r\nwere on the high-road to become dioecious;--that the short pistil in the\r\none form, and the short stamens in the other form were tending towards\r\nabortion. The plants were therefore subjected under this point of view\r\nto trial; but as soon as the flowers with short pistils fertilised with\r\npollen from the short stamens, were found to yield more seeds than any\r\nother of the four possible unions, the abortion-theory was knocked on\r\nthe head. After some additional experiment, it became evident that the\r\ntwo forms, though both were perfect hermaphrodites, bore almost the same\r\nrelation to one another as do the two sexes of an ordinary animal. With\r\nLythrum we have the still more wonderful case of three forms standing in\r\na similar relation to one another. I afterwards found that the offspring\r\nfrom the union of two plants belonging to the same forms presented a\r\nclose and curious analogy with hybrids from the union of two distinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1864 I finished a long paper on _Climbing Plants_, and\r\nsent it to the Linnean Society. The writing of this paper cost me four\r\nmonths: but I was so unwell when I received the proof-sheets that I was\r\nforced to leave them very badly and often obscurely expressed. The paper\r\nwas little noticed, but when in 1875 it was corrected and published as a\r\nseparate book it sold well. I was led to take up this subject by reading\r\na short paper by Asa Gray, published in 1858. He sent me seeds, and on\r\nraising some plants I was so much fascinated and perplexed by the\r\nrevolving movements of the tendrils and stems, which movements are\r\nreally very simple, though appearing at first sight very complex, that I\r\nprocured various other kinds of climbing plants, and studied the whole\r\nsubject. I was all the more attracted to it, from not being at all\r\nsatisfied with the explanation which Henslow gave us in his lectures,\r\nabout twining plants, namely, that they had a natural tendency to grow\r\nup in a spire. This explanation proved quite erroneous. Some of the\r\nadaptations displayed by climbing plants are as beautiful as those of\r\nOrchids for ensuring cross-fertilisation.\r\n\r\nMy _Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication_ was begun, as\r\nalready stated, in the beginning of 1860, but was not published until\r\nthe beginning of 1868. It was a big book, and cost me four years and two\r\nmonths' hard labour. It gives all my observations and an immense number\r\nof facts collected from various sources, about our domestic productions.\r\nIn the second volume the causes and laws of variation, inheritance, &c.,\r\nare discussed, as far as our present state of knowledge permits. Towards\r\nthe end of the work I give my well-abused hypothesis of Pangenesis. An\r\nunverified hypothesis is of little or no value; but if any one should\r\nhereafter be led to make observations by which some such hypothesis\r\ncould be established, I shall have done good service, as an astonishing\r\nnumber of isolated facts can be thus connected together and rendered\r\nintelligible. In 1875 a second and largely corrected edition, which cost\r\nme a good deal of labour, was brought out.\r\n\r\nMy _Descent of Man_ was published in February 1871. As soon as I had\r\nbecome, in the year 1837 or 1838, convinced that species were mutable\r\nproductions, I could not avoid the belief that man must come under the\r\nsame law. Accordingly I collected notes on the subject for my own\r\nsatisfaction, and not for a long time with any intention of publishing.\r\nAlthough in the _Origin of Species_ the derivation of any particular\r\nspecies is never discussed, yet I thought it best, in order that no\r\nhonourable man should accuse me of concealing my views, to add that by\r\nthe work \"light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"\r\nIt would have been useless, and injurious to the success of the book to\r\nhave paraded, without giving any evidence, my conviction with respect to\r\nhis origin.\r\n\r\nBut when I found that many naturalists fully accepted the doctrine of\r\nthe evolution of species, it seemed to me advisable to work up such\r\nnotes as I possessed, and to publish a special treatise on the origin of\r\nman. I was the more glad to do so, as it gave me an opportunity of fully\r\ndiscussing sexual selection--a subject which had always greatly\r\ninterested me. This subject, and that of the variation of our domestic\r\nproductions, together with the causes and laws of variation,\r\ninheritance, and the intercrossing of plants, are the sole subjects\r\nwhich I have been able to write about in full, so as to use all the\r\nmaterials which I have collected. The _Descent of Man_ took me three\r\nyears to write, but then as usual some of this time was lost by\r\nill-health, and some was consumed by preparing new editions and other\r\nminor works. A second and largely corrected edition of the _Descent_\r\nappeared in 1874.\r\n\r\nMy book on the _Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals_ was\r\npublished in the autumn of 1872. I had intended to give only a chapter\r\non the subject in the _Descent of Man_, but as soon as I began to put my\r\nnotes together, I saw that it would require a separate treatise.\r\n\r\nMy first child was born on December 27th, 1839, and I at once commenced\r\nto make notes on the first dawn of the various expressions which he\r\nexhibited, for I felt convinced, even at this early period, that the\r\nmost complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual\r\nand natural origin. During the summer of the following year, 1840, I\r\nread Sir C. Bell's admirable work on expression, and this greatly\r\nincreased the interest which I felt in the subject, though I could not\r\nat all agree with his belief that various muscles had been specially\r\ncreated for the sake of expression. From this time forward I\r\noccasionally attended to the subject, both with respect to man and our\r\ndomesticated animals. My book sold largely; 5267 copies having been\r\ndisposed of on the day of publication.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1860 I was idling and resting near Hartfield, where two\r\nspecies of [Sundew] abound; and I noticed that numerous insects had been\r\nentrapped by the leaves. I carried home some plants, and on giving them\r\ninsects saw the movements of the tentacles, and this made me think it\r\nprobable that the insects were caught for some special purpose.\r\nFortunately a crucial test occurred to me, that of placing a large\r\nnumber of leaves in various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous fluids of\r\nequal density; and as soon as I found that the former alone excited\r\nenergetic movements, it was obvious that here was a fine new field for\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nDuring subsequent years, whenever I had leisure, I pursued my\r\nexperiments, and my book on _Insectivorous Plants_ was published in July\r\n1875--that is sixteen years after my first observations. The delay in\r\nthis case, as with all my other books, has been a great advantage to me;\r\nfor a man after a long interval can criticise his own work, almost as\r\nwell as if it were that of another person. The fact that a plant should\r\nsecrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment,\r\nclosely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a\r\nremarkable discovery.\r\n\r\nDuring this autumn of 1876 I shall publish on the _Effects of Cross-and\r\nSelf-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom_. This book will form a\r\ncomplement to that on the _Fertilisation of Orchids_, in which I showed\r\nhow perfect were the means for cross-fertilisation, and here I shall\r\nshow how important are the results. I was led to make, during eleven\r\nyears, the numerous experiments recorded in this volume, by a mere\r\naccidental observation; and indeed it required the accident to be\r\nrepeated before my attention was thoroughly aroused to the remarkable\r\nfact that seedlings of self-fertilised parentage are inferior, even in\r\nthe first generation, in height and vigour to seedlings of\r\ncross-fertilised parentage. I hope also to republish a revised edition\r\nof my book on Orchids, and hereafter my papers on dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants, together with some additional observations on allied\r\npoints which I never have had time to arrange. My strength will then\r\nprobably be exhausted, and I shall be ready to exclaim \"Nunc dimittis.\"\r\n\r\n_Written May 1st, 1881._--_The Effects of Cross- and Self-Fertilisation_\r\nwas published in the autumn of 1876; and the results there arrived at\r\nexplain, as I believe, the endless and wonderful contrivances for the\r\ntransportal of pollen from one plant to another of the same species. I\r\nnow believe, however, chiefly from the observations of Hermann Mueller,\r\nthat I ought to have insisted more strongly than I did on the many\r\nadaptations for self-fertilisation; though I was well aware of many such\r\nadaptations. A much enlarged edition of my _Fertilisation of Orchids_\r\nwas published in 1877.\r\n\r\nIn this same year _The Different Forms of Flowers, &c._, appeared, and\r\nin 1880 a second edition. This book consists chiefly of the several\r\npapers on Hetero-styled flowers originally published by the Linnean\r\nSociety, corrected, with much new matter added, together with\r\nobservations on some other cases in which the same plant bears two kinds\r\nof flowers. As before remarked, no little discovery of mine ever gave me\r\nso much pleasure as the making out the meaning of heterostyled flowers.\r\nThe results of crossing such flowers in an illegitimate manner, I\r\nbelieve to be very important, as bearing on the sterility of hybrids;\r\nalthough these results have been noticed by only a few persons.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, I had a translation of Dr. Ernst Krause's _Life of Erasmus\r\nDarwin_ published, and I added a sketch of his character and habits from\r\nmaterial in my possession. Many persons have been much interested by\r\nthis little life, and I am surprised that only 800 or 900 copies were\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 I published, with [my son] Frank's assistance our _Power of\r\nMovement in Plants_. This was a tough piece of work. The book bears\r\nsomewhat the same relation to my little book on _Climbing Plants_,\r\nwhich _Cross-Fertilisation_ did to the _Fertilisation of Orchids_; for\r\nin accordance with the principle of evolution it was impossible to\r\naccount for climbing plants having been developed in so many widely\r\ndifferent groups unless all kinds of plants possess some slight power of\r\nmovement of an analogous kind. This I proved to be the case; and I was\r\nfurther led to a rather wide generalisation, viz., that the great and\r\nimportant classes of movements, excited by light, the attraction of\r\ngravity, &c., are all modified forms of the fundamental movement of\r\ncircumnutation. It has always pleased me to exalt plants in the scale of\r\norganised beings; and I therefore felt an especial pleasure in showing\r\nhow many and what admirably well adapted movements the tip of a root\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nI have now (May 1, 1881) sent to the printers the MS. of a little book\r\non _The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms_. This\r\nis a subject of but small importance; and I know not whether it will\r\ninterest any readers,[42] but it has interested me. It is the completion\r\nof a short paper read before the Geological Society more than forty\r\nyears ago, and has revived old geological thoughts.\r\n\r\nI have now mentioned all the books which I have published, and these\r\nhave been the milestones in my life, so that little remains to be said.\r\nI am not conscious of any change in my mind during the last thirty\r\nyears, excepting in one point presently to be mentioned; nor, indeed,\r\ncould any change have been expected unless one of general deterioration.\r\nBut my father lived to his eighty-third year with his mind as lively as\r\never it was, and all his faculties undimmed; and I hope that I may die\r\nbefore my mind fails to a sensible extent. I think that I have become a\r\nlittle more skilful in guessing right explanations and in devising\r\nexperimental tests; but this may probably be the result of mere\r\npractice, and of a larger store of knowledge. I have as much difficulty\r\nas ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty\r\nhas caused me a very great loss of time; but it has had the compensating\r\nadvantage of forcing me to think long and intently about every sentence,\r\nand thus I have been led to see errors in reasoning and in my own\r\nobservations or those of others.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a sort of fatality in my mind leading me to put at\r\nfirst my statement or proposition in a wrong or awkward form. Formerly I\r\nused to think about my sentences before writing them down; but for\r\nseveral years I have found that it saves time to scribble in a vile\r\nhand, whole pages as quickly as I possibly can, contracting half the\r\nwords; and then correct deliberately. Sentences thus scribbled down are\r\noften better ones than I could have written deliberately.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much about my manner of writing, I will add that with\r\nmy large books I spend a good deal of time over the general arrangement\r\nof the matter. I first make the rudest outline in two or three pages,\r\nand then a larger one in several pages, a few words or one word standing\r\nfor a whole discussion or series of facts. Each one of these headings is\r\nagain enlarged and often transferred before I begin to write _in\r\nextenso_. As in several of my books facts observed by others have been\r\nvery extensively used, and as I have always had several quite distinct\r\nsubjects in hand at the same time, I may mention that I keep from thirty\r\nto forty large portfolios, in cabinets with labelled shelves, into which\r\nI can at once put a detached reference or memorandum. I have bought many\r\nbooks, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern\r\nmy work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract,\r\nand of such abstracts I have a large drawer full. Before beginning on\r\nany subject I look to all the short indexes and make a general and\r\nclassified index, and by taking the one or more proper portfolios I have\r\nall the information collected during my life ready for use.\r\n\r\nI have said that in one respect my mind has changed during the last\r\ntwenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty, or beyond it, poetry of\r\nmany kinds, such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth,\r\nColeridge, and Shelley, gave me great pleasure, and even as a schoolboy\r\nI took intense delight in Shakespeare, especially in the historical\r\nplays. I have also said that formerly pictures gave me considerable, and\r\nmusic very great delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read\r\na line of poetry: I have tried lately to read Shakespeare, and found it\r\nso intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also almost lost my\r\ntaste for pictures or music. Music generally sets me thinking too\r\nenergetically on what I have been at work on, instead of giving me\r\npleasure. I retain some taste for fine scenery, but it does not cause me\r\nthe exquisite delight which it formerly did. On the other hand, novels,\r\nwhich are works of the imagination, though not of a very high order,\r\nhave been for years a wonderful relief and pleasure to me, and I often\r\nbless all novelists. A surprising number have been read aloud to me, and\r\nI like all if moderately good, and if they do not end unhappily--against\r\nwhich a law ought to be passed. A novel, according to my taste, does\r\nnot come into the first class unless it contains some person whom one\r\ncan thoroughly love, and if a pretty woman all the better.\r\n\r\nThis curious and lamentable loss of the higher aesthetic tastes is all\r\nthe odder, as books on history, biographies, and travels (independently\r\nof any scientific facts which they may contain), and essays on all sorts\r\nof subjects interest me as much as ever they did. My mind seems to have\r\nbecome a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large\r\ncollections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of\r\nthat part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I\r\ncannot conceive. A man with a mind more highly organised or better\r\nconstituted than mine, would not, I suppose, have thus suffered; and if\r\nI had to live my life again, I would have made a rule to read some\r\npoetry and listen to some music at least once every week; for perhaps\r\nthe parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active\r\nthrough use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may\r\npossibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral\r\ncharacter, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.\r\n\r\nMy books have sold largely in England, have been translated into many\r\nlanguages, and passed through several editions in foreign countries. I\r\nhave heard it said that the success of a work abroad is the best test of\r\nits enduring value. I doubt whether this is at all trustworthy; but\r\njudged by this standard my name ought to last for a few years. Therefore\r\nit may be worth while to try to analyse the mental qualities and the\r\nconditions on which my success has depended; though I am aware that no\r\nman can do this correctly.\r\n\r\nI have no great quickness of apprehension or wit which is so remarkable\r\nin some clever men, for instance, Huxley. I am therefore a poor critic:\r\na paper or book, when first read, generally excites my admiration, and\r\nit is only after considerable reflection that I perceive the weak\r\npoints. My power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought\r\nis very limited; and therefore I could never have succeeded with\r\nmetaphysics or mathematics. My memory is extensive, yet hazy: it\r\nsuffices to make me cautious by vaguely telling me that I have observed\r\nor read something opposed to the conclusion which I am drawing, or on\r\nthe other hand in favour of it; and after a time I can generally\r\nrecollect where to search for my authority. So poor in one sense is my\r\nmemory, that I have never been able to remember for more than a few days\r\na single date or a line of poetry.\r\n\r\nSome of my critics have said, \"Oh, he is a good observer, but he has no\r\npower of reasoning!\" I do not think that this can be true, for the\r\n_Origin of Species_ is one long argument from the beginning to the end,\r\nand it has convinced not a few able men. No one could have written it\r\nwithout having some power of reasoning. I have a fair share of\r\ninvention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly\r\nsuccessful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nOn the favourable side of the balance, I think that I am superior to the\r\ncommon run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and\r\nin observing them carefully. My industry has been nearly as great as it\r\ncould have been in the observation and collection of facts. What is far\r\nmore important, my love of natural science has been steady and ardent.\r\n\r\nThis pure love has, however, been much aided by the ambition to be\r\nesteemed by my fellow naturalists. From my early youth I have had the\r\nstrongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed,--that is,\r\nto group all facts under some general laws. These causes combined have\r\ngiven me the patience to reflect or ponder for any number of years over\r\nany unexplained problem. As far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow\r\nblindly the lead of other men. I have steadily endeavoured to keep my\r\nmind free so as to give up any hypothesis, however much beloved (and I\r\ncannot resist forming one on every subject), as soon as facts are shown\r\nto be opposed to it. Indeed, I have had no choice but to act in this\r\nmanner, for with the exception of the Coral Reefs, I cannot remember a\r\nsingle first-formed hypothesis which had not after a time to be given up\r\nor greatly modified. This has naturally led me to distrust greatly,\r\ndeductive reasoning in the mixed sciences. On the other hand, I am not\r\nvery sceptical,--a frame of mind which I believe to be injurious to the\r\nprogress of science. A good deal of scepticism in a scientific man is\r\nadvisable to avoid much loss of time, [but] I have met with not a few\r\nmen, who, I feel sure, have often thus been deterred from experiment or\r\nobservations, which would have proved directly or indirectly\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\nIn illustration, I will give the oddest case which I have known. A\r\ngentleman (who, as I afterwards heard, is a good local botanist) wrote\r\nto me from the Eastern counties that the seeds or beans of the common\r\nfield-bean had this year everywhere grown on the wrong side of the pod.\r\nI wrote back, asking for further information, as I did not understand\r\nwhat was meant; but I did not receive any answer for a very long time. I\r\nthen saw in two newspapers, one published in Kent and the other in\r\nYorkshire, paragraphs stating that it was a most remarkable fact that\r\n\"the beans this year had all grown on the wrong side.\" So I thought\r\nthere must be some foundation for so general a statement. Accordingly, I\r\nwent to my gardener, an old Kentish man, and asked him whether he had\r\nheard anything about it, and he answered, \"Oh, no, sir, it must be a\r\nmistake, for the beans grow on the wrong side only on leap-year.\" I then\r\nasked him how they grew in common years and how on leap-years, but soon\r\nfound that he knew absolutely nothing of how they grew at any time, but\r\nhe stuck to his belief.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I heard from my first informant, who, with many apologies,\r\nsaid that he should not have written to me had he not heard the\r\nstatement from several intelligent farmers; but that he had since spoken\r\nagain to every one of them, and not one knew in the least what he had\r\nhimself meant. So that here a belief--if indeed a statement with no\r\ndefinite idea attached to it can be called a belief--had spread over\r\nalmost the whole of England without any vestige of evidence.\r\n\r\nI have known in the course of my life only three intentionally falsified\r\nstatements, and one of these may have been a hoax (and there have been\r\nseveral scientific hoaxes) which, however, took in an American\r\nAgricultural Journal. It related to the formation in Holland of a new\r\nbreed of oxen by the crossing of distinct species of Bos (some of which\r\nI happen to know are sterile together), and the author had the impudence\r\nto state that he had corresponded with me, and that I had been deeply\r\nimpressed with the importance of his result. The article was sent to me\r\nby the editor of an English Agricultural Journal, asking for my opinion\r\nbefore republishing it.\r\n\r\nA second case was an account of several varieties, raised by the author\r\nfrom several species of Primula, which had spontaneously yielded a full\r\ncomplement of seed, although the parent plants had been carefully\r\nprotected from the access of insects. This account was published before\r\nI had discovered the meaning of heterostylism, and the whole statement\r\nmust have been fraudulent, or there was neglect in excluding insects so\r\ngross as to be scarcely credible.\r\n\r\nThe third case was more curious: Mr. Huth published in his book on\r\n'Consanguineous Marriage' some long extracts from a Belgian author, who\r\nstated that he had interbred rabbits in the closest manner for very many\r\ngenerations, without the least injurious effects. The account was\r\npublished in a most respectable Journal, that of the Royal Society of\r\nBelgium; but I could not avoid feeling doubts--I hardly know why,\r\nexcept that there were no accidents of any kind, and my experience in\r\nbreeding animals made me think this improbable.\r\n\r\nSo with much hesitation I wrote to Professor Van Beneden, asking him\r\nwhether the author was a trustworthy man. I soon heard in answer that\r\nthe Society had been greatly shocked by discovering that the whole\r\naccount was a fraud.[43] The writer had been publicly challenged in the\r\njournal to say where he had resided and kept his large stock of rabbits\r\nwhile carrying on his experiments, which must have consumed several\r\nyears, and no answer could be extracted from him.\r\n\r\nMy habits are methodical, and this has been of not a little use for my\r\nparticular line of work. Lastly, I have had ample leisure from not\r\nhaving to earn my own bread. Even ill-health, though it has annihilated\r\nseveral years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society\r\nand amusement.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my success as a man of science, whatever this may have\r\namounted to, has been determined, as far as I can judge, by complex and\r\ndiversified mental qualities and conditions. Of these, the most\r\nimportant have been--the love of science--unbounded patience in long\r\nreflecting over any subject--industry in observing and collecting\r\nfacts--and a fair share of invention as well as of common-sense. With\r\nsuch moderate abilities as I possess, it is truly surprising that I\r\nshould have influenced to a considerable extent the belief of scientific\r\nmen on some important points.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] The late Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood's house in Surrey.\r\n\r\n[6] Kept by Rev.

He felt strongly\r\nthat a man's religion is an essentially private matter, and one\r\nconcerning himself alone. This is indicated by the following extract\r\nfrom a letter of 1879:--[45]\r\n\r\n\"What my own views may be is a question of no consequence to any one but\r\nmyself. But, as you ask, I may state that my judgment often\r\nfluctuates.... In my most extreme fluctuations I have never been an\r\nAtheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. I think that\r\ngenerally (and more and more as I grow older), but not always, that an\r\nAgnostic would be the more correct description of my state of mind.\"\r\n\r\nHe naturally shrank from wounding the sensibilities of others in\r\nreligious matters, and he was also influenced by the consciousness that\r\na man ought not to publish on a subject to which he has not given\r\nspecial and continuous thought. That he felt this caution to apply to\r\nhimself in the matter of religion is shown in a letter to Dr. F. E.\r\nAbbott, of Cambridge, U.S. (September 6, 1871). After explaining that\r\nthe weakness arising from bad health prevented him from feeling \"equal\r\nto deep reflection, on the deepest subject which can fill a man's mind,\"\r\nhe goes on to say: \"With respect to my former notes to you, I quite\r\nforget their contents. I have to write many letters, and can reflect but\r\nlittle on what I write; but I fully believe and hope that I have never\r\nwritten a word, which at the time I did not think; but I think you will\r\nagree with me, that anything which is to be given to the public ought to\r\nbe maturely weighed and cautiously put. It never occurred to me that you\r\nwould wish to print any extract from my notes: if it had, I would have\r\nkept a copy. I put 'private' from habit, only as yet partially acquired,\r\nfrom some hasty notes of mine having been printed, which were not in the\r\nleast degree worth printing, though otherwise unobjectionable. It is\r\nsimply ridiculous to suppose that my former note to you would be worth\r\nsending to me, with any part marked which you desire to print; but if\r\nyou like to do so, I will at once say whether I should have any\r\nobjection. I feel in some degree unwilling to express myself publicly on\r\nreligious subjects, as I do not feel that I have thought deeply enough\r\nto justify any publicity.\"\r\n\r\nWhat follows is from another letter to Dr. Abbott (November 16, 1871),\r\nin which my father gives more fully his reasons for not feeling\r\ncompetent to write on religious and moral subjects:--\r\n\r\n\"I can say with entire truth that I feel honoured by your request that I\r\nshould become a contributor to the _Index_, and am much obliged for the\r\ndraft. I fully, also, subscribe to the proposition that it is the duty\r\nof every one to spread what he believes to be the truth; and I honour\r\nyou for doing so, with so much devotion and zeal. But I cannot comply\r\nwith your request for the following reasons; and excuse me for giving\r\nthem in some detail, as I should be very sorry to appear in your eyes\r\nungracious. My health is very weak: I _never_ pass 24 hours without many\r\nhours of discomfort, when I can do nothing whatever. I have thus, also,\r\nlost two whole consecutive months this season. Owing to this weakness,\r\nand my head being often giddy, I am unable to master new subjects\r\nrequiring much thought, and can deal only with old materials. At no time\r\nam I a quick thinker or writer: whatever I have done in science has\r\nsolely been by long pondering, patience and industry.\r\n\r\n\"Now I have never systematically thought much on religion in relation to\r\nscience, or on morals in relation to society; and without steadily\r\nkeeping my mind on such subjects for a long period, I am really\r\nincapable of writing anything worth sending to the _Index_.\"\r\n\r\nHe was more than once asked to give his views on religion, and he had,\r\nas a rule, no objection to doing so in a private letter. Thus, in answer\r\nto a Dutch student, he wrote (April 2, 1873):--\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you will excuse my writing at length, when I tell you that I\r\nhave long been much out of health, and am now staying away from my home\r\nfor rest.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to answer your question briefly; and I am not sure\r\nthat I could do so, even if I wrote at some length. But I may say that\r\nthe impossibility of conceiving that this grand and wondrous universe,\r\nwith our conscious selves, arose through chance, seems to me the chief\r\nargument for the existence of God; but whether this is an argument of\r\nreal value, I have never been able to decide. I am aware that if we\r\nadmit a First Cause, the mind still craves to know whence it came, and\r\nhow it arose. Nor can I overlook the difficulty from the immense amount\r\nof suffering through the world. I am, also, induced to defer to a\r\ncertain extent to the judgment of the many able men who have fully\r\nbelieved in God; but here again I see how poor an argument this is. The\r\nsafest conclusion seems to me that the whole subject is beyond the scope\r\nof man's intellect; but man can do his duty.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in 1879 he was applied to by a German student, in a similar\r\nmanner. The letter was answered by a member of my father's family, who\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Darwin begs me to say that he receives so many letters, that he\r\ncannot answer them all.\r\n\r\n\"He considers that the theory of Evolution is quite compatible with the\r\nbelief in a God; but that you must remember that different persons have\r\ndifferent definitions of what they mean by God.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, did not satisfy the German youth, who again wrote to my\r\nfather, and received from him the following reply:--\r\n\r\n\"I am much engaged, an old man, and out of health, and I cannot spare\r\ntime to answer your questions fully,--nor indeed can they be answered.\r\nScience has nothing to do with Christ, except in so far as the habit of\r\nscientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence. For\r\nmyself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation. As for\r\na future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting\r\nvague probabilities.\"\r\n\r\nThe passages which here follow are extracts, somewhat abbreviated, from\r\na part of the Autobiography, written in 1876, in which my father gives\r\nthe history of his religious views:--\r\n\r\n\"During these two years[46] I was led to think much about religion.\r\nWhilst on board the _Beagle_ I was quite orthodox, and I remember being\r\nheartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves\r\northodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some\r\npoint of morality. I suppose it was the novelty of the argument that\r\namused them. But I had gradually come by this time, _i.e._ 1836 to 1839,\r\nto see that the Old Testament was no more to be trusted than the sacred\r\nbooks of the Hindoos. The question then continually rose before my mind\r\nand would not be banished,--is it credible that if God were now to make\r\na revelation to the Hindoos, he would permit it to be connected with the\r\nbelief in Vishnu, Siva, &c., as Christianity is connected with the Old\r\nTestament? This appeared to me utterly incredible.\r\n\r\n\"By further reflecting that the clearest evidence would be requisite to\r\nmake any sane man believe in the miracles by which Christianity is\r\nsupported,--and that the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the\r\nmore incredible do miracles become,--that the men at that time were\r\nignorant and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us,--that\r\nthe Gospels cannot be proved to have been written simultaneously with\r\nthe events,--that they differ in many important details, far too\r\nimportant, as it seemed to me, to be admitted as the usual inaccuracies\r\nof eye-witnesses;--by such reflections as these, which I give not as\r\nhaving the least novelty or value, but as they influenced me, I\r\ngradually came to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation. The\r\nfact that many false religions have spread over large portions of the\r\nearth like wildfire had some weight with me.\r\n\r\n\"But I was very unwilling to give up my belief; I feel sure of this, for\r\nI can well remember often and often inventing day-dreams of old letters\r\nbetween distinguished Romans, and manuscripts being discovered at\r\nPompeii or elsewhere, which confirmed in the most striking manner all\r\nthat was written in the Gospels. But I found it more and more difficult,\r\nwith free scope given to my imagination, to invent evidence which would\r\nsuffice to convince me. Thus disbelief crept over me at a very slow\r\nrate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n\"Although I did not think much about the existence of a personal God\r\nuntil a considerably later period of my life, I will here give the vague\r\nconclusions to which I have been driven. The old argument from design in\r\nNature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive,\r\nfails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered. We can\r\nno longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve\r\nshell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a\r\ndoor by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of\r\norganic beings, and in the action of natural selection, than in the\r\ncourse which the wind blows. But I have discussed this subject at the\r\nend of my book on the _Variation of Domesticated Animals and\r\nPlants_,[47] and the argument there given has never, as far as I can\r\nsee, been answered.\r\n\r\n\"But passing over the endless beautiful adaptations which we everywhere\r\nmeet with, it may be asked how can the generally beneficent arrangement\r\nof the world be accounted for? Some writers indeed are so much impressed\r\nwith the amount of suffering in the world, that they doubt, if we look\r\nto all sentient beings, whether there is more of misery or of happiness;\r\nwhether the world as a whole is a good or a bad one. According to my\r\njudgment happiness decidedly prevails, though this would be very\r\ndifficult to prove. If the truth of this conclusion be granted, it\r\nharmonizes well with the effects which we might expect from natural\r\nselection. If all the individuals of any species were habitually to\r\nsuffer to an extreme degree, they would neglect to propagate their kind;\r\nbut we have no reason to believe that this has ever, or at least often\r\noccurred. Some other considerations, moreover, lead to the belief that\r\nall sentient beings have been formed so as to enjoy, as a general rule,\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\"Every one who believes, as I do, that all the corporeal and mental\r\norgans (excepting those which are neither advantageous nor\r\ndisadvantageous to the possessor) of all beings have been developed\r\nthrough natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, together with\r\nuse or habit, will admit that these organs have been formed so that\r\ntheir possessors may compete successfully with other beings, and thus\r\nincrease in number. Now an animal may be led to pursue that course of\r\naction which is most beneficial to the species by suffering, such as\r\npain, hunger, thirst, and fear; or by pleasure, as in eating and\r\ndrinking, and in the propagation of the species, &c.; or by both means\r\ncombined, as in the search for food. But pain or suffering of any kind,\r\nif long continued, causes depression and lessens the power of action,\r\nyet is well adapted to make a creature guard itself against any great or\r\nsudden evil. Pleasurable sensations, on the other hand, may be long\r\ncontinued without any depressing effect; on the contrary, they stimulate\r\nthe whole system to increased action. Hence it has come to pass that\r\nmost or all sentient beings have been developed in such a manner,\r\nthrough natural selection, that pleasurable sensations serve as their\r\nhabitual guides. We see this in the pleasure from exertion, even\r\noccasionally from great exertion of the body or mind,--in the pleasure\r\nof our daily meals, and especially in the pleasure derived from\r\nsociability, and from loving our families. The sum of such pleasures as\r\nthese, which are habitual or frequently recurrent, give, as I can hardly\r\ndoubt, to most sentient beings an excess of happiness over misery,\r\nalthough many occasionally suffer much. Such suffering is quite\r\ncompatible with the belief in Natural Selection, which is not perfect in\r\nits action, but tends only to render each species as successful as\r\npossible in the battle for life with other species, in wonderfully\r\ncomplex and changing circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"That there is much suffering in the world no one disputes. Some have\r\nattempted to explain this with reference to man by imagining that it\r\nserves for his moral improvement. But the number of men in the world is\r\nas nothing compared with that of all other sentient beings, and they\r\noften suffer greatly without any moral improvement. This very old\r\nargument from the existence of suffering against the existence of an\r\nintelligent First Cause seems to me a strong one; whereas, as just\r\nremarked, the presence of much suffering agrees well with the view that\r\nall organic beings have been developed through variation and natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\n\"At the present day the most usual argument for the existence of an\r\nintelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings\r\nwhich are experienced by most persons.\r\n\r\n\"Formerly I was led by feelings such as those just referred to (although\r\nI do not think that the religious sentiment was ever strongly developed\r\nin me), to the firm conviction of the existence of God and of the\r\nimmortality of the soul. In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in\r\nthe midst of the grandeur of a Brazilian forest, 'it is not possible to\r\ngive an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, admiration, and\r\ndevotion which fill and elevate the mind.' I well remember my\r\nconviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body;\r\nbut now the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and\r\nfeelings to rise in my mind. It may be truly said that I am like a man\r\nwho has become colour-blind, and the universal belief by men of the\r\nexistence of redness makes my present loss of perception of not the\r\nleast value as evidence. This argument would be a valid one if all men\r\nof all races had the same inward conviction of the existence of one God;\r\nbut we know that this is very far from being the case. Therefore I\r\ncannot see that such inward convictions and feelings are of any weight\r\nas evidence of what really exists. The state of mind which grand scenes\r\nformerly excited in me, and which was intimately connected with a belief\r\nin God, did not essentially differ from that which is often called the\r\nsense of sublimity; and however difficult it may be to explain the\r\ngenesis of this sense, it can hardly be advanced as an argument for the\r\nexistence of God, any more than the powerful though vague and similar\r\nfeelings excited by music.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to immortality, nothing, shows me [so clearly] how strong\r\nand almost instinctive a belief it is as the consideration of the view\r\nnow held by most physicists, namely, that the sun with all the planets\r\nwill in time grow too cold for life, unless indeed some great body\r\ndashes into the sun and thus gives it fresh life. Believing as I do that\r\nman in the distant future will be a far more perfect creature than he\r\nnow is, it is an intolerable thought that he and all other sentient\r\nbeings are doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued\r\nslow progress. To those who fully admit the immortality of the human\r\nsoul, the destruction of our world will not appear so dreadful.\r\n\r\n\"Another source of conviction in the existence of God, connected with\r\nthe reason and not with the feelings, impresses me as having much more\r\nweight. This follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility\r\nof conceiving this immense and wonderful universe, including man with\r\nhis capacity of looking far backwards and far into futurity, as the\r\nresult of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting, I feel\r\ncompelled to look to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some\r\ndegree analogous to that of man; and I deserve to be called a Theist.\r\nThis conclusion was strong in my mind about the time, as far as I can\r\nremember, when I wrote the _Origin of Species_, and it is since that\r\ntime that it has very gradually, with many fluctuations, become weaker.\r\nBut then arises the doubt--can the mind of man, which has, as I fully\r\nbelieve, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the\r\nlowest animals, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?\r\n\r\n\"I cannot pretend to throw the least light on such abstruse problems.\r\nThe mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us, and I for\r\none must be content to remain an Agnostic.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letters repeat to some extent what is given above from the\r\n_Autobiography_. The first one refers to _The Boundaries of Science: a\r\nDialogue_, published in _Macmillan's Magazine_, for July 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Miss Julia Wedgwood_, July 11 [1861].\r\n\r\nSome one has sent us _Macmillan_, and I must tell you how much I admire\r\nyour Article, though at the same time I must confess that I could not\r\nclearly follow you in some parts, which probably is in main part due to\r\nmy not being at all accustomed to metaphysical trains of thought. I\r\nthink that you understand my book[48] perfectly, and that I find a very\r\nrare event with my critics. The ideas in the last page have several\r\ntimes vaguely crossed my mind. Owing to several correspondents, I have\r\nbeen led lately to think, or rather to try to think, over some of the\r\nchief points discussed by you. But the result has been with me a\r\nmaze--something like thinking on the origin of evil, to which you\r\nallude. The mind refuses to look at this universe, being what it is,\r\nwithout having been designed; yet, where one would most expect design,\r\nviz. in the structure of a sentient being, the more I think on the\r\nsubject, the less I can see proof of design. Asa Gray and some others\r\nlook at each variation, or at least at each beneficial variation (which\r\nA. Gray would compare with the raindrops[49] which do not fall on the\r\nsea, but on to the land to fertilise it) as having been providentially\r\ndesigned. Yet when I ask him whether he looks at each variation in the\r\nrock-pigeon, by which man has made by accumulation a pouter or fantail\r\npigeon, as providentially designed for man's amusement, he does not know\r\nwhat to answer; and if he, or any one, admits [that] these variations\r\nare accidental, as far as purpose is concerned (of course not accidental\r\nas to their cause or origin), then I can see no reason why he should\r\nrank the accumulated variations by which the beautifully-adapted\r\nwoodpecker has been formed as providentially designed. For it would be\r\neasy to imagine the enlarged crop of the pouter, or tail of the fantail,\r\nas of some use to birds, in a state of nature, having peculiar habits of\r\nlife. These are the considerations which perplex me about design; but\r\nwhether you will care to hear them, I know not.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of design, he wrote (July 1860) to Dr. Gray:\r\n\r\n\"One word more on 'designed laws' and 'undesigned results.' I see a bird\r\nwhich I want for food, take my gun and kill it, I do this _designedly_.\r\nAn innocent and good man stands under a tree and is killed by a flash of\r\nlightning. Do you believe (and I really should like to hear) that God\r\n_designedly_ killed this man? Many or most persons do believe this; I\r\ncan't and don't. If you believe so, do you believe that when a swallow\r\nsnaps up a gnat that God designed that that particular swallow should\r\nsnap up that particular gnat at that particular instant? I believe that\r\nthe man and the gnat are in the same predicament. If the death of\r\nneither man nor gnat is designed, I see no good reason to believe that\r\ntheir _first_ birth or production should be necessarily designed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to W. Graham._ Down, July 3rd, 1881.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I hope that you will not think it intrusive on my part to\r\nthank you heartily for the pleasure which I have derived from reading\r\nyour admirably-written _Creed of Science_, though I have not yet quite\r\nfinished it, as now that I am old I read very slowly. It is a very long\r\ntime since any other book has interested me so much. The work must have\r\ncost you several years and much hard labour with full leisure for work.\r\nYou would not probably expect any one fully to agree with you on so many\r\nabstruse subjects; and there are some points in your book which I cannot\r\ndigest. The chief one is that the existence of so-called natural laws\r\nimplies purpose. I cannot see this. Not to mention that many expect that\r\nthe several great laws will some day be found to follow inevitably from\r\nsome one single law, yet taking the laws as we now know them, and look\r\nat the moon, where the law of gravitation--and no doubt of the\r\nconservation of energy--of the atomic theory, &c., &c., hold good, and I\r\ncannot see that there is then necessarily any purpose. Would there be\r\npurpose if the lowest organisms alone, destitute of consciousness,\r\nexisted in the moon? But I have had no practice in abstract reasoning,\r\nand I may be all astray. Nevertheless you have expressed my inward\r\nconviction, though far more vividly and clearly than I could have done,\r\nthat the Universe is not the result of chance.[50] But then with me the\r\nhorrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which\r\nhas been developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value\r\nor at all trustworthy. Would any one trust in the convictions of a\r\nmonkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind? Secondly, I\r\nthink that I could make somewhat of a case against the enormous\r\nimportance which you attribute to our greatest men; I have been\r\naccustomed to think second, third, and fourth-rate men of very high\r\nimportance, at least in the case of Science. Lastly, I could show fight\r\non natural selection having done and doing more for the progress of\r\ncivilisation than you seem inclined to admit. Remember what risk the\r\nnations of Europe ran, not so many centuries ago, of being overwhelmed\r\nby the Turks, and how ridiculous such an idea now is! The more civilised\r\nso-called Caucasian races have beaten the Turkish hollow in the struggle\r\nfor existence. Looking to the world at no very distant date, what an\r\nendless number of the lower races will have been eliminated by the\r\nhigher civilised races throughout the world. But I will write no more,\r\nand not even mention the many points in your work which have much\r\ninterested me. I have indeed cause to apologise for troubling you with\r\nmy impressions, and my sole excuse is the excitement in my mind which\r\nyour book has aroused.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to remain, dear sir,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully and obliged.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarwin spoke little on these subjects, and I can contribute nothing from\r\nmy own recollection of his conversation which can add to the impression\r\nhere given of his attitude towards Religion.[51] Some further idea of\r\nhis views may, however, be gathered from occasional remarks in his\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] As an exception, may be mentioned, a few words of concurrence with\r\nDr. Abbott's _Truths for the Times_, which my father allowed to be\r\npublished in the _Index_.\r\n\r\n[45] Addressed to Mr. J. Fordyce, and published by him in his _Aspects\r\nof Scepticism_, 1883.\r\n\r\n[46] October 1836 to January 1839.\r\n\r\n[47] My father asks whether we are to believe that the forms are\r\npreordained of the broken fragments of rock which are fitted together by\r\nman to build his houses. If not, why should we believe that the\r\nvariations of domestic animals or plants are preordained for the sake of\r\nthe breeder? \"But if we give up the principle in one case, ... no shadow\r\nof reason can be assigned for the belief that variations alike in nature\r\nand the result of the same general laws, which have been the groundwork\r\nthrough natural selection of the formation of the most perfectly adapted\r\nanimals in the world, man included, were intentionally and specially\r\nguided.\"--_Variation of Animals and Plants_, 1st Edit. vol. ii. p.\r\n431.--F. D.\r\n\r\n[48] The _Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\n[49] Dr. Gray's rain-drop metaphor occurs in the Essay, _Darwin and his\r\nReviewers_ (_Darwiniana_, p. 157): \"The whole animate life of a country\r\ndepends absolutely upon the vegetation, the vegetation upon the rain.\r\nThe moisture is furnished by the ocean, is raised by the sun's heat from\r\nthe ocean's surface, and is wafted inland by the winds. But what\r\nmultitudes of rain-drops fall back into the ocean--are as much without a\r\nfinal cause as the incipient varieties which come to nothing! Does it\r\ntherefore follow that the rains which are bestowed upon the soil with\r\nsuch rule and average regularity were not designed to support vegetable\r\nand animal life?\"\r\n\r\n[50] The Duke of Argyll (_Good Words_, April 1885, p. 244) has recorded\r\na few words on this subject, spoken by my father in the last year of his\r\nlife. \" ... in the course of that conversation I said to Mr. Darwin,\r\nwith reference to some of his own remarkable works on the _Fertilisation\r\nof Orchids_, and upon _The Earthworms_, and various other observations\r\nhe made of the wonderful contrivances for certain purposes in nature--I\r\nsaid it was impossible to look at these without seeing that they were\r\nthe effect and the expression of mind. I shall never forget Mr. Darwin's\r\nanswer. He looked at me very hard and said, 'Well, that often comes over\r\nme with overwhelming force; but at other times,' and he shook his head\r\nvaguely, adding, 'it seems to go away.'\"\r\n\r\n[51] Dr. Aveling has published an account of a conversation with my\r\nfather. I think that the readers of this pamphlet (_The Religious Views\r\nof Charles Darwin_, Free Thought Publishing Company, 1883) may be misled\r\ninto seeing more resemblance than really existed between the positions\r\nof my father and Dr. Aveling: and I say this in spite of my conviction\r\nthat Dr. Aveling gives quite fairly his impressions of my father's\r\nviews. Dr. Aveling tried to show that the terms \"Agnostic\" and \"Atheist\"\r\nare practically equivalent--that an atheist is one who, without denying\r\nthe existence of God, is without God, inasmuch as he is unconvinced of\r\nthe existence of a Deity. My father's replies implied his preference for\r\nthe unaggressive attitude of an Agnostic. Dr. Aveling seems (p. 5) to\r\nregard the absence of aggressiveness in my father's views as\r\ndistinguishing them in an unessential manner from his own. But, in my\r\njudgment, it is precisely differences of this kind which distinguish him\r\nso completely from the class of thinkers to which Dr. Aveling belongs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STUDY AT DOWN.[52]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF MY FATHER'S EVERYDAY LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my wish in the present chapter to give some idea of my father's\r\neveryday life. It has seemed to me that I might carry out this object in\r\nthe form of a rough sketch of a day's life at Down, interspersed with\r\nsuch recollections as are called up by the record. Many of these\r\nrecollections, which have a meaning for those who knew my father, will\r\nseem colourless or trifling to strangers. Nevertheless, I give them in\r\nthe hope that they may help to preserve that impression of his\r\npersonality which remains on the minds of those who knew and loved\r\nhim--an impression at once so vivid and so untranslatable into words.\r\n\r\nOf his personal appearance (in these days of multiplied photographs) it\r\nis hardly necessary to say much. He was about six feet in height, but\r\nscarcely looked so tall, as he stooped a good deal; in later days he\r\nyielded to the stoop; but I can remember seeing him long ago swinging\r\nback his arms to open out his chest, and holding himself upright with a\r\njerk. He gave one the idea that he had been active rather than strong;\r\nhis shoulders were not broad for his height, though certainly not\r\nnarrow. As a young man he must have had much endurance, for on one of\r\nthe shore excursions from the _Beagle_, when all were suffering from\r\nwant of water, he was one of the two who were better able than the rest\r\nto struggle on in search of it. As a boy he was active, and could jump a\r\nbar placed at the height of the \"Adam's apple\" in his neck.\r\n\r\nHe walked with a swinging action, using a stick heavily shod with iron,\r\nwhich he struck loudly against the ground, producing as he went round\r\nthe \"Sand-walk\" at Down, a rhythmical click which is with all of us a\r\nvery distinct remembrance. As he returned from the midday walk, often\r\ncarrying the waterproof or cloak which had proved too hot, one could see\r\nthat the swinging step was kept up by something of an effort. Indoors\r\nhis step was often slow and laboured, and as he went upstairs in the\r\nafternoon he might be heard mounting the stairs with a heavy footfall,\r\nas if each step were an effort. When interested in his work he moved\r\nabout quickly and easily enough, and often in the midst of dictating he\r\nwent eagerly into the hall to get a pinch of snuff, leaving the study\r\ndoor open, and calling out the last words of his sentence as he left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his activity, he had, I think, no natural grace or neatness\r\nof movement. He was awkward with his hands, and was unable to draw at\r\nall well.[53] This he always regretted, and he frequently urged the\r\nparamount necessity to a young naturalist of making himself a good\r\ndraughtsman.\r\n\r\nHe could dissect well under the simple microscope, but I think it was by\r\ndint of his great patience and carefulness. It was characteristic of him\r\nthat he thought any little bit of skilful dissection something almost\r\nsuperhuman. He used to speak with admiration of the skill with which he\r\nsaw Newport dissect a humble bee, getting out the nervous system with a\r\nfew cuts of a pair of fine scissors. He used to consider cutting\r\nmicroscopic sections a great feat, and in the last year of his life,\r\nwith wonderful energy, took the pains to learn to cut sections of roots\r\nand leaves. His hand was not steady enough to hold the object to be cut,\r\nand he employed a common microtome, in which the pith for holding the\r\nobject was clamped, and the razor slid on a glass surface. He used to\r\nlaugh at himself, and at his own skill in section-cutting, at which he\r\nwould say he was \"speechless with admiration.\" On the other hand, he\r\nmust have had accuracy of eye and power of co-ordinating his movements,\r\nsince he was a good shot with a gun as a young man, and as a boy was\r\nskilful in throwing. He once killed a hare sitting in the flower-garden\r\nat Shrewsbury by throwing a marble at it, and, as a man, he killed a\r\ncross-beak with a stone. He was so unhappy at having uselessly killed\r\nthe cross-beak that he did not mention it for years, and then explained\r\nthat he should never have thrown at it if he had not felt sure that his\r\nold skill had gone from him.\r\n\r\nHis beard was full and almost untrimmed, the hair being grey and white,\r\nfine rather than coarse, and wavy or frizzled. His moustache was\r\nsomewhat disfigured by being cut short and square across. He became very\r\nbald, having only a fringe of dark hair behind.\r\n\r\nHis face was ruddy in colour, and this perhaps made people think him\r\nless of an invalid than he was. He wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (June 13,\r\n1849), \"Every one tells me that I look quite blooming and beautiful; and\r\nmost think I am shamming, but you have never been one of those.\" And it\r\nmust be remembered that at this time he was miserably ill, far worse\r\nthan in later years. His eyes were bluish grey under deep overhanging\r\nbrows, with thick, bushy projecting eye-brows. His high forehead was\r\ndeeply wrinkled, but otherwise his face was not much marked or lined.\r\nHis expression showed no signs of the continual discomfort he suffered.\r\n\r\nWhen he was excited with pleasant talk his whole manner was wonderfully\r\nbright and animated, and his face shared to the full in the general\r\nanimation. His laugh was a free and sounding peal, like that of a man\r\nwho gives himself sympathetically and with enjoyment to the person and\r\nthe thing which have amused him. He often used some sort of gesture with\r\nhis laugh, lifting up his hands or bringing one down with a slap. I\r\nthink, generally speaking, he was given to gesture, and often used his\r\nhands in explaining anything (_e.g._ the fertilisation of a flower) in a\r\nway that seemed rather an aid to himself than to the listener. He did\r\nthis on occasions when most people would illustrate their explanations\r\nby means of a rough pencil sketch.\r\n\r\nHe wore dark clothes, of a loose and easy fit. Of late years he gave up\r\nthe tall hat even in London, and wore a soft black one in winter, and a\r\nbig straw hat in summer. His usual out-of-doors dress was the short\r\ncloak in which Elliot and Fry's photograph[54] represents him, leaning\r\nagainst the pillar of the verandah. Two peculiarities of his indoor\r\ndress were that he almost always wore a shawl over his shoulders, and\r\nthat he had great loose cloth boots lined with fur which he could slip\r\non over his indoor shoes.\r\n\r\nHe rose early, and took a short turn before breakfast, a habit which\r\nbegan when he went for the first time to a water-cure establishment, and\r\nwas preserved till almost the end of his life. I used, as a little boy,\r\nto like going out with him, and I have a vague sense of the red of the\r\nwinter sunrise, and a recollection of the pleasant companionship, and a\r\ncertain honour and glory in it. He used to delight me as a boy by\r\ntelling me how, in still earlier walks, on dark winter mornings, he had\r\nonce or twice met foxes trotting home at the dawning.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfasting alone about 7.45, he went to work at once,\r\nconsidering the 1-1/2 hour between 8 and 9.30 one of his best working\r\ntimes. At 9.30 he came in to the drawing-room for his letters--rejoicing\r\nif the post was a light one and being sometimes much worried if it was\r\nnot. He would then hear any family letters read aloud as he lay on the\r\nsofa.\r\n\r\nThe reading aloud, which also included part of a novel, lasted till\r\nabout half-past ten, when he went back to work till twelve or a quarter\r\npast. By this time he considered his day's work over, and would often\r\nsay, in a satisfied voice, \"_I've_ done a good day's work.\" He then went\r\nout of doors whether it was wet or fine; Polly, his white terrier, went\r\nwith him in fair weather, but in rain she refused or might be seen\r\nhesitating in the verandah, with a mixed expression of disgust and shame\r\nat her own want of courage; generally, however, her conscience carried\r\nthe day, and as soon as he was evidently gone she could not bear to stay\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nMy father was always fond of dogs, and as a young man had the power of\r\nstealing away the affections of his sister's pets; at Cambridge, he won\r\nthe love of his cousin W. D. Fox's dog, and this may perhaps have been\r\nthe little beast which used to creep down inside his bed and sleep at\r\nthe foot every night. My father had a surly dog, who was devoted to him,\r\nbut unfriendly to every one else, and when he came back from the\r\n_Beagle_ voyage, the dog remembered him, but in a curious way, which my\r\nfather was fond of telling. He went into the yard and shouted in his\r\nold manner; the dog rushed out and set off with him on his walk, showing\r\nno more emotion or excitement than if the same thing had happened the\r\nday before, instead of five years ago. This story is made use of in the\r\n_Descent of Man_, 2nd Edit. p. 74.\r\n\r\nIn my memory there were only two dogs which had much connection with my\r\nfather. One was a large black and white half-bred retriever, called Bob,\r\nto which we, as children, were much devoted. He was the dog of whom the\r\nstory of the \"hot-house face\" is told in the _Expression of the\r\nEmotions_.\r\n\r\nBut the dog most closely associated with my father was the\r\nabove-mentioned Polly, a rough, white fox-terrier. She was a\r\nsharp-witted, affectionate dog; when her master was going away on a\r\njourney, she always discovered the fact by the signs of packing going on\r\nin the study, and became low-spirited accordingly. She began, too, to be\r\nexcited by seeing the study prepared for his return home. She was a\r\ncunning little creature, and used to tremble or put on an air of misery\r\nwhen my father passed, while she was waiting for dinner, just as if she\r\nknew that he would say (as he did often say) that \"she was famishing.\"\r\nMy father used to make her catch biscuits off her nose, and had an\r\naffectionate and mock-solemn way of explaining to her before-hand that\r\nshe must \"be a very good girl.\" She had a mark on her back where she had\r\nbeen burnt, and where the hair had re-grown red instead of white, and my\r\nfather used to commend her for this tuft of hair as being in accordance\r\nwith his theory of pangenesis; her father had been a red bull-terrier,\r\nthus the red hair appearing after the burn showed the presence of latent\r\nred gemmules. He was delightfully tender to Polly, and never showed any\r\nimpatience at the attentions she required, such as to be let in at the\r\ndoor, or out at the verandah window, to bark at \"naughty people,\" a\r\nself-imposed duty she much enjoyed. She died, or rather had to be\r\nkilled, a few days after his death.[55]\r\n\r\nMy father's mid-day walk generally began by a call at the greenhouse,\r\nwhere he looked at any germinating seeds or experimental plants which\r\nrequired a casual examination, but he hardly ever did any serious\r\nobserving at this time. Then he went on for his constitutional--either\r\nround the \"Sand-walk,\" or outside his own grounds in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the house. The \"Sand-walk\" was a narrow strip of land\r\n1-1/2 acre in extent, with a gravel-walk round it. On one side of it was\r\na broad old shaw with fair-sized oaks in it, which made a sheltered shady\r\nwalk; the other side was separated from a neighbouring grass field by a\r\nlow quickset hedge, over which you could look at what view there was, a\r\nquiet little valley losing itself in the upland country towards the edge\r\nof the Westerham hill, with hazel coppice and larch plantation, the\r\nremnants of what was once a large wood, stretching away to the Westerham\r\nhigh road. I have heard my father say that the charm of this simple\r\nlittle valley was a decided factor in his choice of a home.\r\n\r\nThe Sand-walk was planted by my father with a variety of trees, such as\r\nhazel, alder, lime, hornbeam, birch, privet, and dogwood, and with a\r\nlong line of hollies all down the exposed side. In earlier times he took\r\na certain number of turns every day, and used to count them by means of\r\na heap of flints, one of which he kicked out on the path each time he\r\npassed. Of late years I think he did not keep to any fixed number of\r\nturns, but took as many as he felt strength for. The Sand-walk was our\r\nplay-ground as children, and here we continually saw my father as he\r\nwalked round. He liked to see what we were doing, and was ever ready to\r\nsympathize in any fun that was going on. It is curious to think how,\r\nwith regard to the Sand-walk in connection with my father, my earliest\r\nrecollections coincide with my latest; it shows the unvarying character\r\nof his habits.\r\n\r\nSometimes when alone he stood still or walked stealthily to observe\r\nbirds or beasts. It was on one of these occasions that some young\r\nsquirrels ran up his back and legs, while their mother barked at them in\r\nan agony from the tree. He always found birds' nests even up to the last\r\nyears of his life, and we, as children, considered that he had a special\r\ngenius in this direction. In his quiet prowls he came across the less\r\ncommon birds, but I fancy he used to conceal it from me as a little boy,\r\nbecause he observed the agony of mind which I endured at not having seen\r\nthe siskin or goldfinch, or some other of the less common birds. He used\r\nto tell us how, when he was creeping noiselessly along in the\r\n\"Big-Woods,\" he came upon a fox asleep in the daytime, which was so much\r\nastonished that it took a good stare at him before it ran off. A Spitz\r\ndog which accompanied him showed no sign of excitement at the fox, and\r\nhe used to end the story by wondering how the dog could have been so\r\nfaint-hearted.\r\n\r\nAnother favourite place was \"Orchis Bank,\" above the quiet Cudham\r\nvalley, where fly- and musk-orchis grew among the junipers, and\r\nCephalanthera and Neottia under the beech boughs; the little wood\r\n\"Hangrove,\" just above this, he was also fond of, and here I remember\r\nhis collecting grasses, when he took a fancy to make out the names of\r\nall the common kinds. He was fond of quoting the saying of one of his\r\nlittle boys, who, having found a grass that his father had not seen\r\nbefore, had it laid by his own plate during dinner, remarking, \"I are an\r\nextraordinary grass-finder!\"\r\n\r\nMy father much enjoyed wandering idly in the garden with my mother or\r\nsome of his children, or making one of a party, sitting on a bench on\r\nthe lawn; he generally sat, however, on the grass, and I remember him\r\noften lying under one of the big lime-trees, with his head on the green\r\nmound at its foot. In dry summer weather, when we often sat out, the\r\nfly-wheel of the well was commonly heard spinning round, and so the\r\nsound became associated with those pleasant days. He used to like to\r\nwatch us playing at lawn-tennis, and often knocked up a stray ball for\r\nus with the curved handle of his stick.\r\n\r\nThough he took no personal share in the management of the garden, he had\r\ngreat delight in the beauty of flowers--for instance, in the mass of\r\nAzaleas which generally stood in the drawing-room. I think he sometimes\r\nfused together his admiration of the structure of a flower and of its\r\nintrinsic beauty; for instance, in the case of the big pendulous pink\r\nand white flowers of Diclytra. In the same way he had an affection,\r\nhalf-artistic, half-botanical, for the little blue Lobelia. In admiring\r\nflowers, he would often laugh at the dingy high-art colours, and\r\ncontrast them with the bright tints of nature. I used to like to hear\r\nhim admire the beauty of a flower; it was a kind of gratitude to the\r\nflower itself, and a personal love for its delicate form and colour. I\r\nseem to remember him gently touching a flower he delighted in; it was\r\nthe same simple admiration that a child might have.\r\n\r\nHe could not help personifying natural things. This feeling came out in\r\nabuse as well as in praise--_e.g._ of some seedlings--\"The little\r\nbeggars are doing just what I don't want them to.\" He would speak in a\r\nhalf-provoked, half-admiring way of the ingenuity of the leaf of a\r\nSensitive Plant in screwing itself out of a basin of water in which he\r\nhad tried to fix it. One might see the same spirit in his way of\r\nspeaking of Sundew, earthworms, &c.[56]\r\n\r\nWithin my memory, his only outdoor recreation, besides walking, was\r\nriding; this was taken up at the recommendation of Dr. Bence Jones, and\r\nwe had the luck to find for him the easiest and quietest cob in the\r\nworld, named \"Tommy.\" He enjoyed these rides extremely, and devised a\r\nseries of short rounds which brought him home in time for lunch. Our\r\ncountry is good for this purpose, owing to the number of small valleys\r\nwhich give a variety to what in a flat country would be a dull loop of\r\nroad. I think he felt surprised at himself, when he remembered how bold\r\na rider he had been, and how utterly old age and bad health had taken\r\naway his nerve. He would say that riding prevented him thinking much\r\nmore effectually than walking--that having to attend to the horse gave\r\nhim occupation sufficient to prevent any really hard thinking. And the\r\nchange of scene which it gave him was good for spirits and health.\r\n\r\nIf I go beyond my own experience, and recall what I have heard him say\r\nof his love for sport, &c., I can think of a good deal, but much of it\r\nwould be a repetition of what is contained in his _Recollections_. He\r\nwas fond of his gun as quite a boy, and became a good shot; he used to\r\ntell how in South America he killed twenty-three snipe in twenty-four\r\nshots. In telling the story he was careful to add that he thought they\r\nwere not quite so wild as English snipe.\r\n\r\nLuncheon at Down came after his mid-day walk; and here I may say a word\r\nor two about his meals generally. He had a boy-like love of sweets,\r\nunluckily for himself, since he was constantly forbidden to take them.\r\nHe was not particularly successful in keeping the \"vows,\" as he called\r\nthem, which he made against eating sweets, and never considered them\r\nbinding unless he made them aloud.\r\n\r\nHe drank very little wine, but enjoyed and was revived by the little he\r\ndid drink. He had a horror of drinking, and constantly warned his boys\r\nthat any one might be led into drinking too much. I remember, in my\r\ninnocence as a small boy, asking him if he had been ever tipsy; and he\r\nanswered very gravely that he was ashamed to say he had once drunk too\r\nmuch at Cambridge. I was much impressed, so that I know now the place\r\nwhere the question was asked.\r\n\r\nAfter his lunch he read the newspaper, lying on the sofa in the\r\ndrawing-room. I think the paper was the only non-scientific matter which\r\nhe read to himself. Everything else, novels, travels, history, was read\r\naloud to him. He took so wide an interest in life, that there was much\r\nto occupy him in newspapers, though he laughed at the wordiness of the\r\ndebates, reading them, I think, only in abstract. His interest in\r\npolitics was considerable, but his opinion on these matters was formed\r\nrather by the way than with any serious amount of thought.\r\n\r\nAfter he had read his paper, came his time for writing letters. These,\r\nas well as the MS. of his books, were written by him as he sat in a huge\r\nhorse-hair chair by the fire, his paper supported on a board resting on\r\nthe arms of the chair. When he had many or long letters to write, he\r\nwould dictate them from a rough copy; these rough copies were written on\r\nthe backs of manuscript or of proof-sheets, and were almost illegible,\r\nsometimes even to himself. He made a rule of keeping all letters that he\r\nreceived; this was a habit which he learnt from his father, and which he\r\nsaid had been of great use to him.\r\n\r\nMany letters were addressed to him by foolish, unscrupulous people, and\r\nall of these received replies. He used to say that if he did not answer\r\nthem, he had it on his conscience afterwards, and no doubt it was in\r\ngreat measure the courtesy with which he answered every one which\r\nproduced the widespread sense of his kindness of nature which was so\r\nevident on his death.\r\n\r\nHe was considerate to his correspondents in other and lesser things--for\r\ninstance, when dictating a letter to a foreigner, he hardly ever failed\r\nto say to me, \"You'd better try and write well, as it's to a foreigner.\"\r\nHis letters were generally written on the assumption that they would be\r\ncarelessly read; thus, when he was dictating, he was careful to tell me\r\nto make an important clause begin with an obvious paragraph, \"to catch\r\nhis eye,\" as he often said. How much he thought of the trouble he gave\r\nothers by asking questions, will be well enough shown by his letters.\r\n\r\nHe had a printed form to be used in replying to troublesome\r\ncorrespondents, but he hardly ever used it; I suppose he never found an\r\noccasion that seemed exactly suitable. I remember an occasion on which\r\nit might have been used with advantage. He received a letter from a\r\nstranger stating that the writer had undertaken to uphold Evolution at a\r\ndebating society, and that being a busy young man, without time for\r\nreading, he wished to have a sketch of my father's views. Even this\r\nwonderful young man got a civil answer, though I think he did not get\r\nmuch material for his speech. His rule was to thank the donors of books,\r\nbut not of pamphlets. He sometimes expressed surprise that so few\r\nthanked him for his books which he gave away liberally; the letters\r\nthat he did receive gave him much pleasure, because he habitually\r\nformed so humble an estimate of the value of all his works, that he was\r\ngenuinely surprised at the interest which they excited.\r\n\r\nIn money and business matters he was remarkably careful and exact. He\r\nkept accounts with great care, classifying them, and balancing at the\r\nend of the year like a merchant. I remember the quick way in which he\r\nwould reach out for his account-book to enter each cheque paid, as\r\nthough he were in a hurry to get it entered before he had forgotten it.\r\nHis father must have allowed him to believe that he would be poorer than\r\nhe really was, for some of the difficulty experienced over finding a\r\nhouse in the country must have arisen from the modest sum he felt\r\nprepared to give. Yet he knew, of course, that he would be in easy\r\ncircumstances, for in his _Recollections_ he mentions this as one of the\r\nreasons for his not having worked at medicine with so much zeal as he\r\nwould have done if he had been obliged to gain his living.\r\n\r\nHe had a pet economy in paper, but it was rather a hobby than a real\r\neconomy. All the blank sheets of letters received were kept in a\r\nportfolio to be used in making notes; it was his respect for paper that\r\nmade him write so much on the backs of his old MS., and in this way,\r\nunfortunately, he destroyed large parts of the original MS. of his\r\nbooks. His feeling about paper extended to waste paper, and he objected,\r\nhalf in fun, to the habit of throwing a spill into the fire after it had\r\nbeen used for lighting a candle.\r\n\r\nHe had a great respect for pure business capacity, and often spoke with\r\nadmiration of a relative who had doubled his fortune. And of himself\r\nwould often say in fun that what he really _was_ proud of was the money\r\nhe had saved. He also felt satisfaction in the money he made by his\r\nbooks. His anxiety to save came in great measure from his fears that his\r\nchildren would not have health enough to earn their own livings, a\r\nforeboding which fairly haunted him for many years. And I have a dim\r\nrecollection of his saying, \"Thank God, you'll have bread and cheese,\"\r\nwhen I was so young that I was inclined to take it literally.\r\n\r\nWhen letters were finished, about three in the afternoon, he rested in\r\nhis bedroom, lying on the sofa, smoking a cigarette, and listening to a\r\nnovel or other book not scientific. He only smoked when resting, whereas\r\nsnuff was a stimulant, and was taken during working hours. He took snuff\r\nfor many years of his life, having learnt the habit at Edinburgh as a\r\nstudent. He had a nice silver snuff-box given him by Mrs. Wedgwood, of\r\nMaer, which he valued much--but he rarely carried it, because it tempted\r\nhim to take too many pinches. In one of his early letters he speaks of\r\nhaving given up snuff for a month, and describes himself as feeling\r\n\"most lethargic, stupid, and melancholy.\" Our former neighbour and\r\nclergyman, Mr. Brodie Innes, tells me that at one time my father made a\r\nresolve not to take snuff, except away from home, \"a most satisfactory\r\narrangement for me,\" he adds, \"as I kept a box in my study, to which\r\nthere was access from the garden without summoning servants, and I had\r\nmore frequently, than might have been otherwise the case, the privilege\r\nof a few minutes' conversation with my dear friend.\" He generally took\r\nsnuff from a jar on the hall-table, because having to go this distance\r\nfor a pinch was a slight check; the clink of the lid of the snuff-jar\r\nwas a very familiar sound. Sometimes when he was in the drawing-room, it\r\nwould occur to him that the study fire must be burning low, and when one\r\nof us offered to see after it, it would turn out that he also wished to\r\nget a pinch of snuff.\r\n\r\nSmoking he only took to permanently of late years, though on his Pampas\r\nrides he learned to smoke with the Gauchos, and I have heard him speak\r\nof the great comfort of a cup of _mate_ and a cigarette when he halted\r\nafter a long ride and was unable to get food for some time.\r\n\r\nHe came down at four o'clock to dress for his walk, and he was so\r\nregular that one might be quite certain it was within a few minutes of\r\nfour when his descending steps were heard.\r\n\r\nFrom about half-past four to half-past five he worked; then he came to\r\nthe drawing-room, and was idle till it was time (about six) to go up for\r\nanother rest with novel-reading and a cigarette.\r\n\r\nLatterly he gave up late dinner, and had a simple tea at half-past seven\r\n(while we had dinner), with an egg or a small piece of meat. After\r\ndinner he never stayed in the room, and used to apologise by saying he\r\nwas an old woman who must be allowed to leave with the ladies. This was\r\none of the many signs and results of his constant weakness and\r\nill-health. Half an hour more or less conversation would make to him the\r\ndifference of a sleepless night and of the loss perhaps of half the next\r\nday's work.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he played backgammon with my mother, two games being played\r\nevery night. For many years a score of the games which each won was\r\nkept, and in this score he took the greatest interest. He became\r\nextremely animated over these games, bitterly lamenting his bad luck\r\nand exploding with exaggerated mock-anger at my mother's good fortune.\r\n\r\nAfter playing backgammon he read some scientific book to himself, either\r\nin the drawing-room, or, if much talking was going on, in the study.\r\n\r\nIn the evening--that is, after he had read as much as his strength would\r\nallow, and before the reading aloud began--he would often lie on the\r\nsofa and listen to my mother playing the piano. He had not a good ear,\r\nyet in spite of this he had a true love of fine music. He used to lament\r\nthat his enjoyment of music had become dulled with age, yet within my\r\nrecollection his love of a good tune was strong. I never heard him hum\r\nmore than one tune, the Welsh song \"Ar hyd y nos,\" which he went through\r\ncorrectly; he used also, I believe, to hum a little Otaheitan song. From\r\nhis want of ear he was unable to recognise a tune when he heard it\r\nagain, but he remained constant to what he liked, and would often say,\r\nwhen an old favourite was played, \"That's a fine thing; what is it?\" He\r\nliked especially parts of Beethoven's symphonies and bits of Handel. He\r\nwas sensitive to differences in style, and enjoyed the late Mrs. Vernon\r\nLushington's playing intensely, and in June 1881, when Hans Richter paid\r\na visit at Down, he was roused to strong enthusiasm by his magnificent\r\nperformance on the piano. He enjoyed good singing, and was moved almost\r\nto tears by grand or pathetic songs. His niece Lady Farrer's singing of\r\nSullivan's \"Will he come\" was a never-failing enjoyment to him. He was\r\nhumble in the extreme about his own taste, and correspondingly pleased\r\nwhen he found that others agreed with him.\r\n\r\nHe became much tired in the evenings, especially of late years, and left\r\nthe drawing-room about ten, going to bed at half-past ten. His nights\r\nwere generally bad, and he often lay awake or sat up in bed for hours,\r\nsuffering much discomfort. He was troubled at night by the activity of\r\nhis thoughts, and would become exhausted by his mind working at some\r\nproblem which he would willingly have dismissed. At night, too, anything\r\nwhich had vexed or troubled him in the day would haunt him, and I think\r\nit was then that he suffered if he had not answered some troublesome\r\ncorrespondent.\r\n\r\nThe regular readings, which I have mentioned, continued for so many\r\nyears, enabled him to get through a great deal of the lighter kinds of\r\nliterature. He was extremely fond of novels, and I remember well the way\r\nin which he would anticipate the pleasure of having a novel read to him\r\nas he lay down or lighted his cigarette. He took a vivid interest both\r\nin plot and characters, and would on no account know beforehand how a\r\nstory finished; he considered looking at the end of a novel as a\r\nfeminine vice. He could not enjoy any story with a tragical end; for\r\nthis reason he did not keenly appreciate George Eliot, though he often\r\nspoke, warmly in praise of _Silas Marner_. Walter Scott, Miss Austen,\r\nand Mrs. Gaskell were read and re-read till they could be read no more.\r\nHe had two or three books in hand at the same time--a novel and perhaps\r\na biography and a book of travels. He did not often read out-of-the-way\r\nor old standard books, but generally kept to the books of the day\r\nobtained from a circulating library.\r\n\r\nHis literary tastes and opinions were not on a level with the rest of\r\nhis mind. He himself, though he was clear as to what he thought good,\r\nconsidered that in matters of literary tastes he was quite outside the\r\npale, and often spoke of what those within it liked or disliked, as if\r\nthey formed a class to which he had no claim to belong.\r\n\r\nIn all matters of art he was inclined to laugh at professed critics and\r\nsay that their opinions were formed by fashion. Thus in painting, he\r\nwould say how in his day every one admired masters who are now\r\nneglected. His love of pictures as a young man is almost a proof that he\r\nmust have had an appreciation of a portrait as a work of art, not as a\r\nlikeness. Yet he often talked laughingly of the small worth of\r\nportraits, and said that a photograph was worth any number of pictures,\r\nas if he were blind to the artistic quality in a painted portrait. But\r\nthis was generally said in his attempts to persuade us to give up the\r\nidea of having his portrait painted, an operation very irksome to him.\r\n\r\nThis way of looking at himself as an ignoramus in all matters of art,\r\nwas strengthened by the absence of pretence, which was part of his\r\ncharacter. With regard to questions of taste, as well as to more serious\r\nthings he had the courage of his opinions. I remember, however, an\r\ninstance that sounds like a contradiction to this: when he was looking\r\nat the Turners in Mr. Ruskin's bedroom, he did not confess, as he did\r\nafterwards, that he could make out absolutely nothing of what Mr. Ruskin\r\nsaw in them. But this little pretence was not for his own sake, but for\r\nthe sake of courtesy to his host. He was pleased and amused when\r\nsubsequently Mr. Ruskin brought him some photographs of pictures (I\r\nthink Vandyke portraits), and courteously seemed to value my father's\r\nopinion about them.\r\n\r\nMuch of his scientific reading was in German, and this was a serious\r\nlabour to him; in reading a book after him, I was often struck at\r\nseeing, from the pencil-marks made each day where he left off, how\r\nlittle he could read at a time. He used to call German the \"Verdammte,\"\r\npronounced as if in English. He was especially indignant with Germans,\r\nbecause he was convinced that they could write simply if they chose, and\r\noften praised Professor Hildebrand of Freiburg for writing German which\r\nwas as clear as French. He sometimes gave a German sentence to a friend,\r\na patriotic German lady, and used to laugh at her if she did not\r\ntranslate it fluently. He himself learnt German simply by hammering away\r\nwith a dictionary; he would say that his only way was to read a sentence\r\na great many times over, and at last the meaning occurred to him. When\r\nhe began German long ago, he boasted of the fact (as he used to tell) to\r\nSir J. Hooker, who replied, \"Ah, my dear fellow, that's nothing; I've\r\nbegun it many times.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his want of grammar, he managed to get on wonderfully with\r\nGerman, and the sentences that he failed to make out were generally\r\ndifficult ones. He never attempted to speak German correctly, but\r\npronounced the words as though they were English; and this made it not a\r\nlittle difficult to help him, when he read out a German sentence and\r\nasked for a translation. He certainly had a bad ear for vocal sounds, so\r\nthat he found it impossible to perceive small differences in\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\nHis wide interest in branches of science that were not specially his own\r\nwas remarkable. In the biological sciences his doctrines make themselves\r\nfelt so widely that there was something interesting to him in most\r\ndepartments. He read a good deal of many quite special works, and large\r\nparts of text books, such as Huxley's _Invertebrate Anatomy_, or such a\r\nbook as Balfour's _Embryology_, where the detail, at any rate, was not\r\nspecially in his own line. And in the case of elaborate books of the\r\nmonograph type, though he did not make a study of them, yet he felt the\r\nstrongest admiration for them.\r\n\r\nIn the non-biological sciences he felt keen sympathy with work of which\r\nhe could not really judge. For instance, he used to read nearly the\r\nwhole of _Nature_, though so much of it deals with mathematics and\r\nphysics. I have often heard him say that he got a kind of satisfaction\r\nin reading articles which (according to himself) he could not\r\nunderstand. I wish I could reproduce the manner in which he would laugh\r\nat himself for it.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable, too, how he kept up his interest in subjects at\r\nwhich he had formerly worked. This was strikingly the case with geology.\r\nIn one of his letters to Mr. Judd he begs him to pay him a visit, saying\r\nthat since Lyell's death he hardly ever gets a geological talk. His\r\nobservations, made only a few years before his death, on the upright\r\npebbles in the drift at Southampton, and discussed in a letter to Sir A.\r\nGeikie, afford another instance. Again, in his letters to Dr. Dohrn, he\r\nshows how his interest in barnacles remained alive. I think it was all\r\ndue to the vitality and persistence of his mind--a quality I have heard\r\nhim speak of as if he felt that he was strongly gifted in that respect.\r\nNot that he used any such phrases as these about himself, but he would\r\nsay that he had the power of keeping a subject or question more or less\r\nbefore him for a great many years. The extent to which he possessed this\r\npower appears when we consider the number of different problems which he\r\nsolved, and the early period at which some of them began to occupy him.\r\n\r\nIt was a sure sign that he was not well when he was idle at any times\r\nother than his regular resting hours; for, as long as he remained\r\nmoderately well, there was no break in the regularity of his life.\r\nWeek-days and Sundays passed by alike, each with their stated intervals\r\nof work and rest. It is almost impossible, except for those who watched\r\nhis daily life, to realise how essential to his well-being was the\r\nregular routine that I have sketched: and with what pain and difficulty\r\nanything beyond it was attempted. Any public appearance, even of the\r\nmost modest kind, was an effort to him. In 1871 he went to the little\r\nvillage church for the wedding of his elder daughter, but he could\r\nhardly bear the fatigue of being present through the short service. The\r\nsame may be said of the few other occasions on which he was present at\r\nsimilar ceremonies.\r\n\r\nI remember him many years ago at a christening; a memory which has\r\nremained with me, because to us children his being at church was an\r\nextraordinary occurrence. I remember his look most distinctly at his\r\nbrother Erasmus's funeral, as he stood in the scattering of snow,\r\nwrapped in a long black funeral cloak, with a grave look of sad reverie.\r\n\r\nWhen, after an absence of many years, he attended a meeting of the\r\nLinnean Society, it was felt to be, and was in fact, a serious\r\nundertaking; one not to be determined on without much sinking of heart,\r\nand hardly to be carried into effect without paying a penalty of\r\nsubsequent suffering. In the same way a breakfast-party at Sir James\r\nPaget's, with some of the distinguished visitors to the Medical\r\nCongress (1881), was to him a severe exertion.\r\n\r\nThe early morning was the only time at which he could make any effort of\r\nthe kind, with comparative impunity. Thus it came about that the visits\r\nhe paid to his scientific friends in London were by preference made as\r\nearly as ten in the morning. For the same reason he started on his\r\njourneys by the earliest possible train, and used to arrive at the\r\nhouses of relatives in London when they were beginning their day.\r\n\r\nHe kept an accurate journal of the days on which he worked and those on\r\nwhich his ill health prevented him from working, so that it would be\r\npossible to tell how many were idle days in any given year. In this\r\njournal--a little yellow Letts's Diary, which lay open on his\r\nmantel-piece, piled on the diaries of previous years--he also entered\r\nthe day on which he started for a holiday and that of his return.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent holidays were visits of a week to London, either to\r\nhis brother's house (6 Queen Anne Street), or to his daughter's (4\r\nBryanston Street). He was generally persuaded by my mother to take these\r\nshort holidays, when it became clear from the frequency of \"bad days,\"\r\nor from the swimming of his head, that he was being overworked. He went\r\nunwillingly, and tried to drive hard bargains, stipulating, for\r\ninstance, that he should come home in five days instead of six. The\r\ndiscomfort of a journey to him was, at least latterly, chiefly in the\r\nanticipation, and in the miserable sinking feeling from which he\r\nsuffered immediately before the start; even a fairly long journey, such\r\nas that to Coniston, tired him wonderfully little, considering how much\r\nan invalid he was; and he certainly enjoyed it in an almost boyish way,\r\nand to a curious degree.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as he has said, some of his aesthetic tastes had suffered a\r\ngradual decay, his love of scenery remained fresh and strong. Every walk\r\nat Coniston was a fresh delight, and he was never tired of praising the\r\nbeauty of the broken hilly country at the head of the lake.\r\n\r\nBesides these longer holidays, there were shorter visits to various\r\nrelatives--to his brother-in-law's house, close to Leith Hill, and to\r\nhis son near Southampton. He always particularly enjoyed rambling over\r\nrough open country, such as the commons near Leith Hill and Southampton,\r\nthe heath-covered wastes of Ashdown Forest, or the delightful \"Rough\"\r\nnear the house of his friend Sir Thomas Farrer. He never was quite idle\r\neven on these holidays, and found things to observe. At Hartfield he\r\nwatched Drosera catching insects, &c.; at Torquay he observed the\r\nfertilisation of an orchid (_Spiranthes_), and also made out the\r\nrelations of the sexes in Thyme.\r\n\r\nHe rejoiced at his return home after his holidays, and greatly enjoyed\r\nthe welcome he got from his dog Polly, who would get wild with\r\nexcitement, panting, squeaking, rushing round the room, and jumping on\r\nand off the chairs; and he used to stoop down, pressing her face to his,\r\nletting her lick him, and speaking to her with a peculiarly tender,\r\ncaressing voice.\r\n\r\nMy father had the power of giving to these summer holidays a charm which\r\nwas strongly felt by all his family. The pressure of his work at home\r\nkept him at the utmost stretch of his powers of endurance, and when\r\nreleased from it, he entered on a holiday with a youthfulness of\r\nenjoyment that made his companionship delightful; we felt that we saw\r\nmore of him in a week's holiday than in a month at home.\r\n\r\nBesides the holidays which I have mentioned, there were his visits to\r\nwater-cure establishments. In 1849, when very ill, suffering from\r\nconstant sickness, he was urged by a friend to try the water-cure, and\r\nat last agreed to go to Dr. Gully's establishment at Malvern. His\r\nletters to Mr. Fox show how much good the treatment did him; he seems to\r\nhave thought that he had found a cure for his troubles, but, like all\r\nother remedies, it had only a transient effect on him. However, he found\r\nit, at first, so good for him, that when he came home he built himself a\r\ndouche-bath, and the butler learnt to be his bathman.\r\n\r\nHe was too, a frequent patient at Dr. Lane's water-cure establishment,\r\nMoor Park, near Aldershot, visits to which he always looked back with\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nSome idea of his relation to his family and his friends may be gathered\r\nfrom what has gone before; it would be impossible to attempt a complete\r\naccount of these relationships, but a slightly fuller outline may not be\r\nout of place. Of his married life I cannot speak, save in the briefest\r\nmanner. In his relationship towards my mother, his tender and\r\nsympathetic nature was shown in its most beautiful aspect. In her\r\npresence he found his happiness, and through her, his life--which might\r\nhave been overshadowed by gloom--became one of content and quiet\r\ngladness.\r\n\r\nThe _Expression of the Emotions_ shows how closely he watched his\r\nchildren; it was characteristic of him that (as I have heard him tell),\r\nalthough he was so anxious to observe accurately the expression of a\r\ncrying child, his sympathy with the grief spoiled his observation. His\r\nnote-book, in which are recorded sayings of his young children, shows\r\nhis pleasure in them. He seemed to retain a sort of regretful memory of\r\nthe childhoods which had faded away, and thus he wrote in his\r\n_Recollections_:--\"When you were very young it was my delight to play\r\nwith you all, and I think with a sigh that such days can never return.\"\r\n\r\nI quote, as showing the tenderness of his nature, some sentences from an\r\naccount of his little daughter Annie, written a few days after her\r\ndeath:--\r\n\r\n\"Our poor child, Annie, was born in Gower Street, on March 2, 1841, and\r\nexpired at Malvern at mid-day on the 23rd of April, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"I write these few pages, as I think in after years, if we live, the\r\nimpressions now put down will recall more vividly her chief\r\ncharacteristics. From whatever point I look back at her, the main\r\nfeature in her disposition which at once rises before me, is her buoyant\r\njoyousness, tempered by two other characteristics, namely, her\r\nsensitiveness, which might easily have been overlooked by a stranger,\r\nand her strong affection. Her joyousness and animal spirits radiated\r\nfrom her whole countenance, and rendered every movement elastic and full\r\nof life and vigour. It was delightful and cheerful to behold her. Her\r\ndear face now rises before me, as she used sometimes to come running\r\ndownstairs with a stolen pinch of snuff for me, her whole form radiant\r\nwith the pleasure of giving pleasure. Even when playing with her\r\ncousins, when her joyousness almost passed into boisterousness, a single\r\nglance of my eye, not of displeasure (for I thank God I hardly ever cast\r\none on her), but of want of sympathy, would for some minutes alter her\r\nwhole countenance.\r\n\r\n\"The other point in her character, which made her joyousness and spirits\r\nso delightful, was her strong affection, which was of a most clinging,\r\nfondling nature. When quite a baby, this showed itself in never being\r\neasy without touching her mother, when in bed with her; and quite lately\r\nshe would, when poorly, fondle for any length of time one of her\r\nmother's arms. When very unwell, her mother lying down beside her,\r\nseemed to soothe her in a manner quite different from what it would have\r\ndone to any of our other children. So, again, she would at almost any\r\ntime spend half-an-hour in arranging my hair, 'making it,' as she called\r\nit, 'beautiful,' or in smoothing, the poor dear darling, my collar or\r\ncuffs--in short, in fondling me.\r\n\r\n\"Besides her joyousness thus tempered, she was in her manners\r\nremarkably cordial, frank, open, straightforward, natural, and without\r\nany shade of reserve. Her whole mind was pure and transparent. One felt\r\none knew her thoroughly and could trust her. I always thought, that come\r\nwhat might, we should have had, in our old age, at least one loving\r\nsoul, which nothing could have changed. All her movements were vigorous,\r\nactive, and usually graceful. When going round the Sand-walk with me,\r\nalthough I walked fast, yet she often used to go before, pirouetting in\r\nthe most elegant way, her dear face bright all the time with the\r\nsweetest smiles. Occasionally she had a pretty coquettish manner towards\r\nme, the memory of which is charming. She often used exaggerated\r\nlanguage, and when I quizzed her by exaggerating what she had said, how\r\nclearly can I now see the little toss of the head, and exclamation of\r\n'Oh, papa, what a shame of you!' In the last short illness, her conduct\r\nin simple truth was angelic. She never once complained; never became\r\nfretful; was ever considerate of others, and was thankful in the most\r\ngentle, pathetic manner for everything done for her. When so exhausted\r\nthat she could hardly speak, she praised everything that was given her,\r\nand said some tea 'was beautifully good.' When I gave her some water,\r\nshe said, 'I quite thank you;' and these, I believe, were the last\r\nprecious words ever addressed by her dear lips to me.\r\n\r\n\"We have lost the joy of the household, and the solace of our old age.\r\nShe must have known how we loved her. Oh, that she could now know how\r\ndeeply, how tenderly, we do still and shall ever love her dear joyous\r\nface! Blessings on her![57]\r\n\r\n\"April 30, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nWe, his children, all took especial pleasure in the games he played at\r\nwith us, and in his stories, which, partly on account of their rarity,\r\nwere considered specially delightful.\r\n\r\nThe way he brought us up is shown by a little story about my brother\r\nLeonard, which my father was fond of telling. He came into the\r\ndrawing-room and found Leonard dancing about on the sofa, to the peril\r\nof the springs, and said, \"Oh, Lenny, Lenny, that's against all rules,\"\r\nand received for answer, \"Then I think you'd better go out of the room.\"\r\nI do not believe he ever spoke an angry word to any of his children in\r\nhis life; but I am certain that it never entered our heads to disobey\r\nhim. I well remember one occasion when my father reproved me for a piece\r\nof carelessness; and I can still recall the feeling of depression which\r\ncame over me, and the care which he took to disperse it by speaking to\r\nme soon afterwards with especial kindness. He kept up his delightful,\r\naffectionate manner towards us all his life. I sometimes wonder that he\r\ncould do so, with such an undemonstrative race as we are; but I hope he\r\nknew how much we delighted in his loving words and manner. He allowed\r\nhis grown-up children to laugh with and at him, and was generally\r\nspeaking on terms of perfect equality with us.\r\n\r\nHe was always full of interest about each one's plans or successes. We\r\nused to laugh at him, and say he would not believe in his sons, because,\r\nfor instance, he would be a little doubtful about their taking some bit\r\nof work for which he did not feel sure that they had knowledge enough.\r\nOn the other hand, he was only too much inclined to take a favourable\r\nview of our work. When I thought he had set too high a value on anything\r\nthat I had done, he used to be indignant and inclined to explode in mock\r\nanger. His doubts were part of his humility concerning what was in any\r\nway connected with himself; his too favourable view of our work was due\r\nto his sympathetic nature, which made him lenient to every one.\r\n\r\nHe kept up towards his children his delightful manner of expressing his\r\nthanks; and I never wrote a letter, or read a page aloud to him, without\r\nreceiving a few kind words of recognition. His love and goodness towards\r\nhis little grandson Bernard were great; and he often spoke of the\r\npleasure it was to him to see \"his little face opposite to him\" at\r\nluncheon. He and Bernard used to compare their tastes; _e.g._, in liking\r\nbrown sugar better than white, &c.; the result being, \"We always agree,\r\ndon't we?\"\r\n\r\nMy sister writes:--\r\n\r\n\"My first remembrances of my father are of the delights of his playing\r\nwith us. He was passionately attached to his own children, although he\r\nwas not an indiscriminate child-lover. To all of us he was the most\r\ndelightful play-fellow, and the most perfect sympathiser. Indeed it is\r\nimpossible adequately to describe how delightful a relation his was to\r\nhis family, whether as children or in their later life.\r\n\r\n\"It is a proof of the terms on which we were, and also of how much he\r\nwas valued as a play-fellow, that one of his sons when about four years\r\nold tried to bribe him with sixpence to come and play in working hours.\r\n\r\n\"He must have been the most patient and delightful of nurses. I remember\r\nthe haven of peace and comfort it seemed to me when I was unwell, to be\r\ntucked up on the study sofa, idly considering the old geological map\r\nhung on the wall. This must have been in his working hours, for I always\r\npicture him sitting in the horse hair arm chair by the corner of the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Another mark of his unbounded patience was the way in which we were\r\nsuffered to make raids into the study when we had an absolute need of\r\nsticking plaster, string, pins, scissors, stamps, foot rule, or hammer.\r\nThese and other such necessaries were always to be found in the study,\r\nand it was the only place where this was a certainty. We used to feel it\r\nwrong to go in during work time; still, when the necessity was great, we\r\ndid so. I remember his patient look when he said once, 'Don't you think\r\nyou could not come in again, I have been interrupted very often.' We\r\nused to dread going in for sticking plaster, because he disliked to see\r\nthat we had cut ourselves, both for our sakes and on account of his\r\nacute sensitiveness to the sight of blood. I well remember lurking about\r\nthe passage till he was safe away, and then stealing in for the plaster.\r\n\r\n\"Life seems to me, as I look back upon it, to have been very regular in\r\nthose early days, and except relations (and a few intimate friends), I\r\ndo not think any one came to the house. After lessons, we were always\r\nfree to go where we would, and that was chiefly in the drawing-room and\r\nabout the garden, so that we were very much with both my father and\r\nmother. We used to think it most delightful when he told us any stories\r\nabout the _Beagle_, or about early Shrewsbury days--little bits about\r\nschool life and his boyish tastes.\r\n\r\n\"He cared for all our pursuits and interests, and lived our lives with\r\nus in a way that very few fathers do. But I am certain that none of us\r\nfelt that this intimacy interfered the least with our respect and\r\nobedience. Whatever he said was absolute truth and law to us. He always\r\nput his whole mind into answering any of our questions. One trifling\r\ninstance makes me feel how he cared for what we cared for. He had no\r\nspecial taste for cats, but yet he knew and remembered the\r\nindividualities of my many cats, and would talk about the habits and\r\ncharacters of the more remarkable ones years after they had died.\r\n\r\n\"Another characteristic of his treatment of his children was his respect\r\nfor their liberty, and for their personality. Even as quite a little\r\ngirl, I remember rejoicing in this sense of freedom. Our father and\r\nmother would not even wish to know what we were doing or thinking unless\r\nwe wished to tell. He always made us feel that we were each of us\r\ncreatures whose opinions and thoughts were valuable to him, so that\r\nwhatever there was best in us came out in the sunshine of his presence.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think his exaggerated sense of our good qualities,\r\nintellectual or moral, made us conceited, as might perhaps have been\r\nexpected, but rather more humble and grateful to him. The reason being\r\nno doubt that the influence of his character, of his sincerity and\r\ngreatness of nature, had a much deeper and more lasting effect than any\r\nsmall exaltation which his praises or admiration may have caused to our\r\nvanity.\"[58]\r\n\r\nAs head of a household he was much loved and respected; he always spoke\r\nto servants with politeness, using the expression, \"would you be so\r\ngood,\" in asking for anything. He was hardly ever angry with his\r\nservants; it shows how seldom this occurred, that when, as a small boy,\r\nI overheard a servant being scolded, and my father speaking angrily, it\r\nimpressed me as an appalling circumstance, and I remember running up\r\nstairs out of a general sense of awe. He did not trouble himself about\r\nthe management of the garden, cows, &c. He considered the horses so\r\nlittle his concern, that he used to ask doubtfully whether he might have\r\na horse and cart to send to Keston for Sundew, or to the Westerham\r\nnurseries for plants, or the like.\r\n\r\nAs a host my father had a peculiar charm: the presence of visitors\r\nexcited him, and made him appear to his best advantage. At Shrewsbury,\r\nhe used to say, it was his father's wish that the guests should be\r\nattended to constantly, and in one of the letters to Fox he speaks of\r\nthe impossibility of writing a letter while the house was full of\r\ncompany. I think he always felt uneasy at not doing more for the\r\nentertainment of his guests, but the result was successful; and, to make\r\nup for any loss, there was the gain that the guests felt perfectly free\r\nto do as they liked. The most usual visitors were those who stayed from\r\nSaturday till Monday; those who remained longer were generally\r\nrelatives, and were considered to be rather more my mother's affair than\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nBesides these visitors, there were foreigners and other strangers, who\r\ncame down for luncheon and went away in the afternoon. He used\r\nconscientiously to represent to them the enormous distance of Down from\r\nLondon, and the labour it would be to come there, unconsciously taking\r\nfor granted that they would find the journey as toilsome as he did\r\nhimself. If, however, they were not deterred, he used to arrange their\r\njourneys for them, telling them when to come, and practically when to\r\ngo. It was pleasant to see the way in which he shook hands with a guest\r\nwho was being welcomed for the first time; his hand used to shoot out in\r\na way that gave one the feeling that it was hastening to meet the\r\nguest's hands. With old friends his hand came down with a hearty swing\r\ninto the other hand in a way I always had satisfaction in seeing. His\r\ngood-bye was chiefly characterised by the pleasant way in which he\r\nthanked his guests, as he stood at the hall-door, for having come to see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThese luncheons were successful entertainments, there was no drag or\r\nflagging about them, my father was bright and excited throughout the\r\nwhole visit. Professor De Candolle has described a visit to Down, in his\r\nadmirable and sympathetic sketch of my father.[59] He speaks of his\r\nmanner as resembling that of a \"savant\" of Oxford or Cambridge. This\r\ndoes not strike me as quite a good comparison; in his ease and\r\nnaturalness there was more of the manner of some soldiers; a manner\r\narising from total absence of pretence or affectation. It was this\r\nabsence of pose, and the natural and simple way in which he began\r\ntalking to his guests, so as to get them on their own lines, which made\r\nhim so charming a host to a stranger. His happy choice of matter for\r\ntalk seemed to flow out of his sympathetic nature, and humble, vivid\r\ninterest in other people's work.\r\n\r\nTo some, I think, he caused actual pain by his modesty; I have seen the\r\nlate Francis Balfour quite discomposed by having knowledge ascribed to\r\nhimself on a point about which my father claimed to be utterly ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to seize on the characteristics of my father's\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nHe had more dread than have most people of repeating his stories, and\r\ncontinually said, \"You must have heard me tell,\" or \"I daresay I've told\r\nyou.\" One peculiarity he had, which gave a curious effect to his\r\nconversation. The first few words of a sentence would often remind him\r\nof some exception to, or some reason against, what he was going to say;\r\nand this again brought up some other point, so that the sentence would\r\nbecome a system of parenthesis within parenthesis, and it was often\r\nimpossible to understand the drift of what he was saying until he came\r\nto the end of his sentence. He used to say of himself that he was not\r\nquick enough to hold an argument with any one, and I think this was\r\ntrue. Unless it was a subject on which he was just then at work, he\r\ncould not get the train of argument into working order quickly enough.\r\nThis is shown even in his letters; thus, in the case of two letters to\r\nProfessor Semper about the effect of isolation, he did not recall the\r\nseries of facts he wanted until some days after the first letter had\r\nbeen sent off.\r\n\r\nWhen puzzled in talking, he had a peculiar stammer on the first word of\r\na sentence. I only recall this occurring with words beginning with w;\r\npossibly he had a special difficulty with this letter, for I have heard\r\nhim say that as a boy he could not pronounce w, and that sixpence was\r\noffered him if he could say \"white wine,\" which he pronounced \"rite\r\nrine.\" Possibly he may have inherited this tendency from Erasmus Darwin\r\nwho stammered.[60]\r\n\r\nHe sometimes combined his metaphors in a curious way, using such a\r\nphrase as \"holding on like life,\"--a mixture of \"holding on for his\r\nlife,\" and \"holding on like grim death.\" It came from his eager way of\r\nputting emphasis into what he was saying. This sometimes gave an air of\r\nexaggeration where it was not intended; but it gave, too, a noble air of\r\nstrong and generous conviction; as, for instance, when he gave his\r\nevidence before the Royal Commission on vivisection, and came out with\r\nhis words about cruelty, \"It deserves detestation and abhorrence.\" When\r\nhe felt strongly about any similar question, he could hardly trust\r\nhimself to speak, as he then easily became angry, a thing which he\r\ndisliked excessively. He was conscious that his anger had a tendency to\r\nmultiply itself in the utterance, and for this reason dreaded (for\r\nexample) having to reprove a servant.\r\n\r\nIt was a proof of the modesty of his manner of talking, that when, for\r\ninstance, a number of visitors came over from Sir John Lubbock's for a\r\nSunday afternoon call, he never seemed to be preaching or lecturing,\r\nalthough he had so much of the talk to himself. He was particularly\r\ncharming when \"chaffing\" any one, and in high spirits over it. His\r\nmanner at such times was light-hearted and boyish, and his refinement of\r\nnature came out most strongly. So, when he was talking to a lady who\r\npleased and amused him, the combination of raillery and deference in his\r\nmanner was delightful to see. There was a personal dignity about him,\r\nwhich the most familiar intercourse did not diminish. One felt that he\r\nwas the last person with whom anyone would wish to take a liberty, nor\r\ndo I remember an instance of such a thing occurring to him.\r\n\r\nWhen my father had several guests he managed them well, getting a talk\r\nwith each, or bringing two or three together round his chair. In these\r\nconversations there was always a good deal of fun, and, speaking\r\ngenerally, there was either a humorous turn in his talk, or a sunny\r\ngeniality which served instead. Perhaps my recollection of a pervading\r\nelement of humour is the more vivid, because the best talks were with\r\nMr. Huxley, in whom there is the aptness which is akin to humour, even\r\nwhen humour itself is not there. My father enjoyed Mr. Huxley's humour\r\nexceedingly, and would often say, \"What splendid fun Huxley is!\" I think\r\nhe probably had more scientific argument (of the nature of a fight) with\r\nLyell and Sir Joseph Hooker.\r\n\r\nHe used to say that it grieved him to find that for the friends of his\r\nlater life he had not the warm affection of his youth. Certainly in his\r\nearly letters from Cambridge he gives proofs of strong friendship for\r\nHerbert and Fox; but no one except himself would have said that his\r\naffection for his friends was not, throughout life, of the warmest\r\npossible kind. In serving a friend he would not spare himself, and\r\nprecious time and strength were willingly given. He undoubtedly had, to\r\nan unusual degree, the power of attaching his friends to him. He had\r\nmany warm friendships, but to Sir Joseph Hooker he was bound by ties of\r\naffection stronger than we often see among men. He wrote in his\r\n_Recollections_, \"I have known hardly any man more lovable than Hooker.\"\r\n\r\nHis relationship to the village people was a pleasant one; he treated\r\nthem, one and all, with courtesy, when he came in contact with them, and\r\ntook an interest in all relating to their welfare. Some time after he\r\ncame to live at Down he helped to found a Friendly Club, and served as\r\ntreasurer for thirty years. He took much trouble about the club, keeping\r\nits accounts with minute and scrupulous exactness, and taking pleasure\r\nin its prosperous condition. Every Whit-Monday the club marched round\r\nwith band and banner and paraded on the lawn in front of the house.\r\nThere he met them, and explained to them their financial position in a\r\nlittle speech seasoned with a few well-worn jokes. He was often unwell\r\nenough to make even this little ceremony an exertion, but I think he\r\nnever failed to meet them.\r\n\r\nHe was also treasurer of the Coal Club, which gave him a certain amount\r\nof work, and he acted for some years as a County Magistrate.\r\n\r\nWith regard to my father's interest in the affairs of the village, Mr.\r\nBrodie Innes has been so good as to give me his recollections:--\r\n\r\n\"On my becoming Vicar of Down in 1846, we became friends, and so\r\ncontinued till his death. His conduct towards me and my family was one\r\nof unvarying kindness, and we repaid it by warm affection.\r\n\r\n\"In all parish matters he was an active assistant; in matters connected\r\nwith the schools, charities, and other business, his liberal\r\ncontribution was ever ready, and in the differences which at times\r\noccurred in that, as in other parishes, I was always sure of his\r\nsupport. He held that where there was really no important objection, his\r\nassistance should be given to the clergyman, who ought to know the\r\ncircumstances best, and was chiefly responsible.\"\r\n\r\nHis intercourse with strangers was marked with scrupulous and rather\r\nformal politeness, but in fact he had few opportunities of meeting\r\nstrangers, and the quiet life he led at Down made him feel confused in a\r\nlarge gathering; for instance, at the Royal Society's _soirees_ he felt\r\noppressed by the numbers. The feeling that he ought to know people, and\r\nthe difficulty he had in remembering faces in his latter years, also\r\nadded to his discomfort on such occasions. He did not realise that he\r\nwould be recognised from his photographs, and I remember his being\r\nuneasy at being obviously recognised by a stranger at the Crystal Palace\r\nAquarium.\r\n\r\nI must say something of his manner of working: a striking characteristic\r\nwas his respect for time; he never forgot how precious it was. This was\r\nshown, for instance, in the way in which he tried to curtail his\r\nholidays; also, and more clearly, with respect to shorter periods. He\r\nwould often say, that saving the minutes was the way to get work done;\r\nhe showed this love of saving the minutes in the difference he felt\r\nbetween a quarter of an hour and ten minutes' work; he never wasted a\r\nfew spare minutes from thinking that it was not worth while to set to\r\nwork. I was often struck by his way of working up to the very limit of\r\nhis strength, so that he suddenly stopped in dictating, with the words,\r\n\"I believe I mustn't do any more.\" The same eager desire not to lose\r\ntime was seen in his quick movements when at work. I particularly\r\nremember noticing this when he was making an experiment on the roots of\r\nbeans, which required some care in manipulation; fastening the little\r\nbits of card upon the roots was done carefully and necessarily slowly,\r\nbut the intermediate movements were all quick; taking a fresh bean,\r\nseeing that the root was healthy, impaling it on a pin, fixing it on a\r\ncork, and seeing that it was vertical, &c.; all these processes were\r\nperformed with a kind of restrained eagerness. He gave one the\r\nimpression of working with pleasure, and not with any drag. I have an\r\nimage, too, of him as he recorded the result of some experiment, looking\r\neagerly at each root, &c., and then writing with equal eagerness. I\r\nremember the quick movement of his head up and down as he looked from\r\nthe object to the notes.\r\n\r\nHe saved a great deal of time through not having to do things twice.\r\nAlthough he would patiently go on repeating experiments where there was\r\nany good to be gained, he could not endure having to repeat an\r\nexperiment which ought, if complete care had been taken, to have told\r\nits story at first--and this gave him a continual anxiety that the\r\nexperiment should not be wasted; he felt the experiment to be sacred,\r\nhowever slight a one it was. He wished to learn as much as possible from\r\nan experiment, so that he did not confine himself to observing the\r\nsingle point to which the experiment was directed, and his power of\r\nseeing a number of other things was wonderful. I do not think he cared\r\nfor preliminary or rough observations intended to serve as guides and to\r\nbe repeated. Any experiment done was to be of some use, and in this\r\nconnection I remember how strongly he urged the necessity of keeping the\r\nnotes of experiments which failed, and to this rule he always adhered.\r\n\r\nIn the literary part of his work he had the same horror of losing time,\r\nand the same zeal in what he was doing at the moment, and this made him\r\ncareful not to be obliged unnecessarily to read anything a second time.\r\n\r\nHis natural tendency was to use simple methods and few instruments. The\r\nuse of the compound microscope has much increased since his youth, and\r\nthis at the expense of the simple one. It strikes us nowadays as\r\nextraordinary that he should have had no compound microscope when he\r\nwent his _Beagle_ voyage; but in this he followed the advice of Robert\r\nBrown, who was an authority in such matters. He always had a great\r\nliking for the simple microscope, and maintained that nowadays it was\r\ntoo much neglected, and that one ought always to see as much as possible\r\nwith the simple before taking to the compound microscope. In one of his\r\nletters he speaks on this point, and remarks that he suspects the work\r\nof a man who never uses the simple microscope.\r\n\r\nHis dissecting table was a thick board, let into a window of the study;\r\nit was lower than an ordinary table, so that he could not have worked at\r\nit standing; but this, from wishing to save his strength, he would not\r\nhave done in any case. He sat at his dissecting-table on a curious low\r\nstool which had belonged to his father, with a seat revolving on a\r\nvertical spindle, and mounted on large castors, so that he could turn\r\neasily from side to side. His ordinary tools, &c., were lying about on\r\nthe table, but besides these a number of odds and ends were kept in a\r\nround table full of radiating drawers, and turning on a vertical axis,\r\nwhich stood close by his left side, as he sat at his microscope-table.\r\nThe drawers were labelled, \"best tools,\" \"rough tools,\" \"specimens,\"\r\n\"preparations for specimens,\" &c. The most marked peculiarity of the\r\ncontents of these drawers was the care with which little scraps and\r\nalmost useless things were preserved; he held the well-known belief,\r\nthat if you threw a thing away you were sure to want it directly--and so\r\nthings accumulated.\r\n\r\nIf any one had looked at his tools, &c., lying on the table, he would\r\nhave been struck by an air of simpleness, make-shift, and oddity.\r\n\r\nAt his right hand were shelves, with a number of other odds and ends,\r\nglasses, saucers, tin biscuit boxes for germinating seeds, zinc labels,\r\nsaucers full of sand, &c., &c. Considering how tidy and methodical he\r\nwas in essential things, it is curious that he bore with so many\r\nmake-shifts: for instance, instead of having a box made of a desired\r\nshape, and stained black inside, he would hunt up something like what he\r\nwanted and get it darkened inside with shoe-blacking; he did not care to\r\nhave glass covers made for tumblers in which he germinated seeds, but\r\nused broken bits of irregular shape, with perhaps a narrow angle\r\nsticking uselessly out on one side. But so much of his experimenting was\r\nof a simple kind, that he had no need for any elaboration, and I think\r\nhis habit in this respect was in great measure due to his desire to\r\nhusband his strength, and not waste it on inessential things.\r\n\r\nHis way of marking objects may here be mentioned. If he had a number of\r\nthings to distinguish, such as leaves, flowers, &c., he tied threads of\r\ndifferent colours round them. In particular he used this method when he\r\nhad only two classes of objects to distinguish; thus in the case of\r\ncrossed and self-fertilised flowers, one set would be marked with black\r\nand one with white thread, tied round the stalk of the flower. I\r\nremember well the look of two sets of capsules, gathered and waiting to\r\nbe weighed, counted, &c., with pieces of black and of white thread to\r\ndistinguish the trays in which they lay. When he had to compare two sets\r\nof seedlings, sowed in the same pot, he separated them by a partition of\r\nzinc-plate; and the zinc-label, which gave the necessary details about\r\nthe experiment, was always placed on a certain side, so that it became\r\ninstinctive with him to know without reading the label which were the\r\n\"crossed\" and which the \"self-fertilised.\"\r\n\r\nHis love of each particular experiment, and his eager zeal not to lose\r\nthe fruit of it, came out markedly in these crossing experiments--in the\r\nelaborate care he took not to make any confusion in putting capsules\r\ninto wrong trays, &c. &c. I can recall his appearance as he counted\r\nseeds under the simple microscope with an alertness not usually\r\ncharacterising such mechanical work as counting. I think he personified\r\neach seed as a small demon trying to elude him by getting into the wrong\r\nheap, or jumping away altogether; and this gave to the work the\r\nexcitement of a game. He had great faith in instruments, and I do not\r\nthink it naturally occurred to him to doubt the accuracy of a scale, a\r\nmeasuring glass, &c. He was astonished when we found that one of his\r\nmicrometers differed from the other. He did not require any great\r\naccuracy in most of his measurements, and had not good scales; he had an\r\nold three-foot rule, which was the common property of the household, and\r\nwas constantly being borrowed, because it was the only one which was\r\ncertain to be in its place--unless, indeed, the last borrower had\r\nforgotten to put it back. For measuring the height of plants, he had a\r\nseven-foot deal rod, graduated by the village carpenter. Latterly he\r\ntook to using paper scales graduated to millimeters. I do not mean by\r\nthis account of his instruments that any of his experiments suffered\r\nfrom want of accuracy in measurement, I give them as examples of his\r\nsimple methods and faith in others--faith at least in instrument-makers,\r\nwhose whole trade was a mystery to him.\r\n\r\nA few of his mental characteristics, bearing especially on his mode of\r\nworking, occur to me. There was one quality of mind which seemed to be\r\nof special and extreme advantage in leading him to make discoveries. It\r\nwas the power of never letting exceptions pass unnoticed. Everybody\r\nnotices a fact as an exception when it is striking or frequent, but he\r\nhad a special instinct for arresting an exception. A point apparently\r\nslight and unconnected with his present work is passed over by many a\r\nman almost unconsciously with some half-considered explanation, which is\r\nin fact no explanation. It was just these things that he seized on to\r\nmake a start from. In a certain sense there is nothing special in this\r\nprocedure, many discoveries being made by means of it. I only mention it\r\nbecause, as I watched him at work, the value of this power to an\r\nexperimenter was so strongly impressed upon me.\r\n\r\nAnother quality which was shown in his experimental work, was his power\r\nof sticking to a subject; he used almost to apologise for his patience,\r\nsaying that he could not bear to be beaten, as if this were rather a\r\nsign of weakness on his part. He often quoted the saying, \"It's dogged\r\nas does it;\" and I think doggedness expresses his frame of mind almost\r\nbetter than perseverance. Perseverance seems hardly to express his\r\nalmost fierce desire to force the truth to reveal itself. He often said\r\nthat it was important that a man should know the right point at which to\r\ngive up an inquiry. And I think it was his tendency to pass this point\r\nthat inclined him to apologise for his perseverance, and gave the air of\r\ndoggedness to his work.\r\n\r\nHe often said that no one could be a good observer unless he was an\r\nactive theoriser. This brings me back to what I said about his instinct\r\nfor arresting exceptions: it was as though he were charged with\r\ntheorising power ready to flow into any channel on the slightest\r\ndisturbance, so that no fact, however small, could avoid releasing a\r\nstream of theory, and thus the fact became magnified into importance. In\r\nthis way it naturally happened that many untenable theories occurred to\r\nhim; but fortunately his richness of imagination was equalled by his\r\npower of judging and condemning the thoughts that occurred to him. He\r\nwas just to his theories, and did not condemn them unheard; and so it\r\nhappened that he was willing to test what would seem to most people not\r\nat all worth testing. These rather wild trials he called \"fool's\r\nexperiments,\" and enjoyed extremely. As an example I may mention that\r\nfinding the seed-leaves of a kind of sensitive plant, to be highly\r\nsensitive to vibrations of the table, he fancied that they might\r\nperceive the vibrations of sound, and therefore made me play my bassoon\r\nclose to a plant.[61]\r\n\r\nThe love of experiment was very strong in him, and I can remember the\r\nway he would say, \"I shan't be easy till I have tried it,\" as if an\r\noutside force were driving him. He enjoyed experimenting much more than\r\nwork which only entailed reasoning, and when he was engaged on one of\r\nhis books which required argument and the marshalling of facts, he felt\r\nexperimental work to be a rest or holiday. Thus, while working upon the\r\n_Variations of Animals and Plants_ in 1860-61, he made out the\r\nfertilisation of Orchids, and thought himself idle for giving so much\r\ntime to them. It is interesting to think that so important a piece of\r\nresearch should have been undertaken and largely worked out as a pastime\r\nin place of more serious work. The letters to Hooker of this period\r\ncontain expressions such as, \"God forgive me for being so idle; I am\r\nquite sillily interested in the work.\" The intense pleasure he took in\r\nunderstanding the adaptations for fertilisation is strongly shown in\r\nthese letters. He speaks in one of his letters of his intention of\r\nworking at Sundew as a rest from the _Descent of Man_. He has described\r\nin his _Recollections_ the strong satisfaction he felt in solving the\r\nproblem of heterostylism.[62] And I have heard him mention that the\r\nGeology of South America gave him almost more pleasure than anything\r\nelse. It was perhaps this delight in work requiring keen observation\r\nthat made him value praise given to his observing powers almost more\r\nthan appreciation of his other qualities.\r\n\r\nFor books he had no respect, but merely considered them as tools to be\r\nworked with. Thus he did not bind them, and even when a paper book fell\r\nto pieces from use, as happened to Mueller's _Befruchtung_, he preserved\r\nit from complete dissolution by putting a metal clip over its back. In\r\nthe same way he would cut a heavy book in half, to make it more\r\nconvenient to hold. He used to boast that he had made Lyell publish the\r\nsecond edition of one of his books in two volumes, instead of in one, by\r\ntelling him how he had been obliged to cut it in half. Pamphlets were\r\noften treated even more severely than books, for he would tear out, for\r\nthe sake of saving room, all the pages except the one that interested\r\nhim. The consequence of all this was, that his library was not\r\nornamental, but was striking from being so evidently a working\r\ncollection of books.\r\n\r\nHe was methodical in his manner of reading books and pamphlets bearing\r\non his own work. He had one shelf on which were piled up the books he\r\nhad not yet read, and another to which they were transferred after\r\nhaving been read, and before being catalogued. He would often groan over\r\nhis unread books, because there were so many which he knew he should\r\nnever read. Many a book was at once transferred to the other heap,\r\nmarked with a cypher at the end, to show that it contained no passages\r\nfor reference, or inscribed, perhaps, \"not read,\" or \"only skimmed.\" The\r\nbooks accumulated in the \"read\" heap until the shelves overflowed, and\r\nthen, with much lamenting, a day was given up to the cataloguing. He\r\ndisliked this work, and as the necessity of undertaking the work became\r\nimperative, would often say, in a voice of despair, \"We really must do\r\nthese books soon.\"\r\n\r\nIn each book, as he read it, he marked passages bearing on his work. In\r\nreading a book or pamphlet, &c., he made pencil-lines at the side of the\r\npage, often adding short remarks, and at the end made a list of the\r\npages marked. When it was to be catalogued and put away, the marked\r\npages were looked at, and so a rough abstract of the book was made. This\r\nabstract would perhaps be written under three or four headings on\r\ndifferent sheets, the facts being sorted out and added to the previously\r\ncollected facts in the different subjects. He had other sets of\r\nabstracts arranged, not according to subject, but according to the\r\nperiodicals from which they were taken. When collecting facts on a large\r\nscale, in earlier years, he used to read through, and make abstracts, in\r\nthis way, of whole series of journals.\r\n\r\nIn some of his early letters he speaks of filling several note-books\r\nwith facts for his book on species; but it was certainly early that he\r\nadopted his plan of using portfolios, as described in the\r\n_Recollections_.[63] My father and M. de Candolle were mutually pleased\r\nto discover that they had adopted the same plan of classifying facts. De\r\nCandolle describes the method in his _Phytologie_, and in his sketch of\r\nmy father mentions the satisfaction he felt in seeing it in action at\r\nDown.\r\n\r\nBesides these portfolios, of which there are some dozens full of notes,\r\nthere are large bundles of MS. marked \"used\" and put away. He felt the\r\nvalue of his notes, and had a horror of their destruction by fire. I\r\nremember, when some alarm of fire had happened, his begging me to be\r\nespecially careful, adding very earnestly, that the rest of his life\r\nwould be miserable if his notes and books were destroyed.\r\n\r\nHe shows the same feeling in writing about the loss of a manuscript, the\r\npurport of his words being, \"I have a copy, or the loss would have\r\nkilled me.\" In writing a book he would spend much time and labour in\r\nmaking a skeleton or plan of the whole, and in enlarging and\r\nsub-classing each heading, as described in his _Recollections_. I think\r\nthis careful arrangement of the plan was not at all essential to the\r\nbuilding up of his argument, but for its presentment, and for the\r\narrangement of his facts. In his _Life of Erasmus Darwin_, as it was\r\nfirst printed in slips, the growth of the book from a skeleton was\r\nplainly visible. The arrangement was altered afterwards, because it was\r\ntoo formal and categorical, and seemed to give the character of his\r\ngrandfather rather by means of a list of qualities than as a complete\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nIt was only within the last few years that he adopted a plan of writing\r\nwhich he was convinced suited him best, and which is described in the\r\n_Recollections_; namely, writing a rough copy straight off without the\r\nslightest attention to style. It was characteristic of him that he felt\r\nunable to write with sufficient want of care if he used his best paper,\r\nand thus it was that he wrote on the backs of old proofs or manuscript.\r\nThe rough copy was then reconsidered, and a fair copy was made. For this\r\npurpose he had foolscap paper ruled at wide intervals, the lines being\r\nneeded to prevent him writing so closely that correction became\r\ndifficult. The fair copy was then corrected, and was recopied before\r\nbeing sent to the printers. The copying was done by Mr. E. Norman, who\r\nbegan this work many years ago when village schoolmaster at Down. My\r\nfather became so used to Mr. Norman's handwriting, that he could not\r\ncorrect manuscript, even when clearly written out by one of his\r\nchildren, until it had been recopied by Mr. Norman. The MS., on\r\nreturning from Mr. Norman, was once more corrected, and then sent off to\r\nthe printers. Then came the work of revising and correcting the proofs,\r\nwhich my father found especially wearisome.\r\n\r\nWhen the book was passing through the \"slip\" stage he was glad to have\r\ncorrections and suggestions from others. Thus my mother looked over the\r\nproofs of the _Origin_. In some of the later works my sister, Mrs.\r\nLitchfield, did much of the correction. After my sister's marriage\r\nperhaps most of the work fell to my share.\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Litchfield, writes:--\r\n\r\n\"This work was very interesting in itself, and it was inexpressibly\r\nexhilarating to work for him. He was so ready to be convinced that any\r\nsuggested alteration was an improvement, and so full of gratitude for\r\nthe trouble taken. I do not think that he ever forgot to tell me what\r\nimprovement he thought I had made, and he used almost to excuse himself\r\nif he did not agree with any correction. I think I felt the singular\r\nmodesty and graciousness of his nature through thus working for him in a\r\nway I never should otherwise have done.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the commonest corrections needed were of obscurities due to the\r\nomission of a necessary link in the reasoning, evidently omitted through\r\nfamiliarity with the subject. Not that there was any fault in the\r\nsequence of the thoughts, but that from familiarity with his argument he\r\ndid not notice when the words failed to reproduce his thought. He also\r\nfrequently put too much matter into one sentence, so that it had to be\r\ncut up into two.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think the pains which my father took over the literary\r\npart of the work was very remarkable. He often laughed or grumbled at\r\nhimself for the difficulty which he found in writing English, saying,\r\nfor instance, that if a bad arrangement of a sentence was possible, he\r\nshould be sure to adopt it. He once got much amusement and satisfaction\r\nout of the difficulty which one of the family found in writing a short\r\ncircular. He had the pleasure of correcting and laughing at obscurities,\r\ninvolved sentences, and other defects, and thus took his revenge for all\r\nthe criticism he had himself to bear with. He would quote with\r\nastonishment Miss Martineau's advice to young authors, to write straight\r\noff and send the MS. to the printer without correction. But in some\r\ncases he acted in a somewhat similar manner. When a sentence became\r\nhopelessly involved, he would ask himself, \"now what _do_ you want to\r\nsay?\" and his answer written down, would often disentangle the\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nHis style has been much praised; on the other hand, at least one good\r\njudge has remarked to me that it is not a good style. It is, above all\r\nthings, direct and clear; and it is characteristic of himself in its\r\nsimplicity bordering on naivete, and in its absence of pretence. He had\r\nthe strongest disbelief in the common idea that a classical scholar must\r\nwrite good English; indeed, he thought that the contrary was the case.\r\nIn writing, he sometimes showed the same tendency to strong expressions\r\nthat he did in conversation. Thus in the _Origin_, p. 440, there is a\r\ndescription of a larval cirripede, \"with six pairs of beautifully\r\nconstructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and\r\nextremely complex antennae.\" We used to laugh at him for this sentence,\r\nwhich we compared to an advertisement. This tendency to give himself up\r\nto the enthusiastic turn of his thought, without fear of being ludicrous\r\nappears elsewhere in his writings.\r\n\r\nHis courteous and conciliatory tone towards his reader is remarkable,\r\nand it must be partly this quality which revealed his personal sweetness\r\nof character to so many who had never seen him. I have always felt it to\r\nbe a curious fact, that he who has altered the face of Biological\r\nScience, and is in this respect the chief of the moderns, should have\r\nwritten and worked in so essentially a non-modern spirit and manner. In\r\nreading his books one is reminded of the older naturalists rather than\r\nof any modern school of writers. He was a Naturalist in the old sense of\r\nthe word, that is, a man who works at many branches of science, not\r\nmerely a specialist in one. Thus it is, that, though he founded whole\r\nnew divisions of special subjects--such as the fertilisation of flowers,\r\ninsectivorous plants, &c.--yet even in treating these very subjects he\r\ndoes not strike the reader as a specialist. The reader feels like a\r\nfriend who is being talked to by a courteous gentleman, not like a pupil\r\nbeing lectured by a professor. The tone of such a book as the _Origin_\r\nis charming, and almost pathetic; it is the tone of a man who, convinced\r\nof the truth of his own views, hardly expects to convince others; it is\r\njust the reverse of the style of a fanatic, who tries to force belief on\r\nhis readers. The reader is never scorned for any amount of doubt which\r\nhe may be imagined to feel, and his scepticism is treated with patient\r\nrespect. A sceptical reader, or perhaps even an unreasonable reader,\r\nseems to have been generally present to his thoughts. It was in\r\nconsequence of this feeling, perhaps, that he took much trouble over\r\npoints which he imagined would strike the reader, or save him trouble,\r\nand so tempt him to read.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason he took much interest in the illustrations of his\r\nbooks, and I think rated rather too highly their value. The\r\nillustrations for his earlier books were drawn by professional artists.\r\nThis was the case in _Animals and Plants_, the _Descent of Man_, and the\r\n_Expression of the Emotions_. On the other hand, _Climbing Plants_,\r\n_Insectivorous Plants_, the _Movements of Plants_, and _Forms of\r\nFlowers_, were, to a large extent, illustrated by some of his\r\nchildren--my brother George having drawn by far the most. It was\r\ndelightful to draw for him, as he was enthusiastic in his praise of very\r\nmoderate performances. I remember well his charming manner of receiving\r\nthe drawings of one of his daughters-in-law, and how he would finish his\r\nwords of praise by saying, \"Tell A----, Michael Angelo is nothing to\r\nit.\" Though he praised so generously, he always looked closely at the\r\ndrawing, and easily detected mistakes or carelessness.\r\n\r\nHe had a horror of being lengthy, and seems to have been really much\r\nannoyed and distressed when he found how the _Variations of Animals and\r\nPlants_ was growing under his hands. I remember his cordially agreeing\r\nwith 'Tristram Shandy's' words, \"Let no man say, 'Come, I'll write a\r\nduodecimo.'\"\r\n\r\nHis consideration for other authors was as marked a characteristic as\r\nhis tone towards his reader. He speaks of all other authors as persons\r\ndeserving of respect. In cases where, as in the case of ----'s\r\nexperiments on Drosera, he thought lightly of the author, he speaks of\r\nhim in such a way that no one would suspect it. In other cases he treats\r\nthe confused writings of ignorant persons as though the fault lay with\r\nhimself for not appreciating or understanding them. Besides this general\r\ntone of respect, he had a pleasant way of expressing his opinion on the\r\nvalue of a quoted work, or his obligation for a piece of private\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nHis respectful feeling was not only admirable, but was I think of\r\npractical use in making him ready to consider the ideas and observations\r\nof all manner of people. He used almost to apologise for this, and would\r\nsay that he was at first inclined to rate everything too highly.\r\n\r\nIt was a great merit in his mind that, in spite of having so strong a\r\nrespectful feeling towards what he read, he had the keenest of instincts\r\nas to whether a man was trustworthy or not. He seemed to form a very\r\ndefinite opinion as to the accuracy of the men whose books he read; and\r\nemployed this judgment in his choice of facts for use in argument or as\r\nillustrations. I gained the impression that he felt this power of\r\njudging of a man's trustworthiness to be of much value.\r\n\r\nHe had a keen feeling of the sense of honour that ought to reign among\r\nauthors, and had a horror of any kind of laxness in quoting. He had a\r\ncontempt for the love of honour and glory, and in his letters often\r\nblames himself for the pleasure he took in the success of his books, as\r\nthough he were departing from his ideal--a love of truth and\r\ncarelessness about fame. Often, when writing to Sir J. Hooker what he\r\ncalls a boasting letter, he laughs at himself for his conceit and want\r\nof modesty. A wonderfully interesting letter is given in Chapter X.\r\nbequeathing to my mother, in case of his death, the care of publishing\r\nthe manuscript of his first essay on evolution. This letter seems to me\r\nfull of an intense desire that his theory should succeed as a\r\ncontribution to knowledge, and apart from any desire for personal fame.\r\nHe certainly had the healthy desire for success which a man of strong\r\nfeelings ought to have. But at the time of the publication of the\r\n_Origin_ it is evident that he was overwhelmingly satisfied with the\r\nadherence of such men as Lyell, Hooker, Huxley, and Asa Gray, and did\r\nnot dream of or desire any such general fame as that to which he\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nConnected with his contempt for the undue love of fame, was an equally\r\nstrong dislike of all questions of priority. The letters to Lyell, at\r\nthe time of the _Origin_, show the anger he felt with himself for not\r\nbeing able to repress a feeling of disappointment at what he thought was\r\nMr. Wallace's forestalling of all his years of work. His sense of\r\nliterary honour comes out strongly in these letters; and his feeling\r\nabout priority is again shown in the admiration expressed in his\r\n_Recollections_ of Mr. Wallace's self-annihilation.\r\n\r\nHis feeling about reclamations, including answers to attacks and all\r\nkinds of discussions, was strong. It is simply expressed in a letter to\r\nFalconer (1863): \"If I ever felt angry towards you, for whom I have a\r\nsincere friendship, I should begin to suspect that I was a little mad. I\r\nwas very sorry about your reclamation, as I think it is in every case a\r\nmistake and should be left to others. Whether I should so act myself\r\nunder provocation is a different question.\" It was a feeling partly\r\ndictated by instinctive delicacy, and partly by a strong sense of the\r\nwaste of time, energy, and temper thus caused. He said that he owed his\r\ndetermination not to get into discussions[64] to the advice of\r\nLyell,--advice which he transmitted to those among his friends who were\r\ngiven to paper warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the character of my father's working life is to be understood, the\r\nconditions of ill-health, under which he worked, must be constantly\r\nborne in mind. He bore his illness with such uncomplaining patience,\r\nthat even his children can hardly, I believe, realise the extent of his\r\nhabitual suffering. In their case the difficulty is heightened by the\r\nfact that, from the days of their earliest recollections, they saw him\r\nin constant ill-health,--and saw him, in spite of it, full of pleasure\r\nin what pleased them. Thus, in later life, their perception of what he\r\nendured had to be disentangled from the impression produced in childhood\r\nby constant genial kindness under conditions of unrecognised difficulty.\r\nNo one indeed, except my mother, knows the full amount of suffering he\r\nendured, or the full amount of his wonderful patience. For all the\r\nlatter years of his life she never left him for a night; and her days\r\nwere so planned that all his resting hours might be shared with her. She\r\nshielded him from every avoidable annoyance, and omitted nothing that\r\nmight save him trouble, or prevent him becoming overtired, or that might\r\nalleviate the many discomforts of his ill-health. I hesitate to speak\r\nthus freely of a thing so sacred as the life-long devotion which\r\nprompted all this constant and tender care. But it is, I repeat, a\r\nprincipal feature of his life, that for nearly forty years he never knew\r\none day of the health of ordinary men, and that thus his life was one\r\nlong struggle against the weariness and strain of sickness. And this\r\ncannot be told without speaking of the one condition which enabled him\r\nto bear the strain and fight out the struggle to the end.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] From the _Century Magazine_, January 1883.\r\n\r\n[53] The figure in _Insectivorous Plants_ representing the aggregated\r\ncell-contents was drawn by him.\r\n\r\n[54] _Life and Letters_, vol. iii. frontispiece.\r\n\r\n[55] The basket in which she usually lay curled up near the fire in his\r\nstudy is faithfully represented in Mr. Parson's drawing given at the\r\nhead of the chapter.\r\n\r\n[56] Cf. Leslie Stephen's _Swift_, 1882, p. 200, where Swift's\r\ninspection of the manners and customs of servants are compared to my\r\nfather's observations on worms, \"The difference is,\" says Mr. Stephen,\r\n\"that Darwin had none but kindly feelings for worms.\"\r\n\r\n[57] The words, \"A good and dear child,\" form the descriptive part of\r\nthe inscription on her gravestone. See the _Athenaeum_, Nov. 26, 1887.\r\n\r\n[58] Some pleasant recollections of my father's life at Down, written by\r\nour friend and former neighbour, Mrs. Wallis Nash, have been published\r\nin the _Overland Monthly_ (San Francisco), October 1890.\r\n\r\n[59] _Darwin considere au point de vue des causes de son succes_\r\n(Geneva, 1882).\r\n\r\n[60] My father related a Johnsonian answer of Erasmus Darwin's: \"Don't\r\nyou find it very inconvenient stammering, Dr. Darwin?\" \"No, Sir, because\r\nI have time to think before I speak, and don't ask impertinent\r\nquestions.\"\r\n\r\n[61] This is not so much an example of superabundant theorising from a\r\nsmall cause as of his wish to test the most improbable ideas.\r\n\r\n[62] That is to say, the sexual relations in such plants as the cowslip.\r\n\r\n[63] The racks in which the portfolios were placed are shown in the\r\nillustration at the head of the chapter, in the recess at the right-hand\r\nside of the fire-place.\r\n\r\n[64] He departed from his rule in his \"Note on the Habits of the Pampas\r\nWoodpecker, _Colaptes campestris_,\" _Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1870, p. 705:\r\nalso in a letter published in the _Athenaeum_ (1863, p. 554), in which\r\ncase he afterwards regretted that he had not remained silent. His\r\nreplies to criticisms, in the latter editions of the _Origin_, can\r\nhardly be classed as infractions of his rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE LIFE.--THE APPOINTMENT TO THE 'BEAGLE.'\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father's Cambridge life comprises the time between the Lent Term,\r\n1828, when he came up to Christ's College as a Freshman, and the end of\r\nthe May Term, 1831, when he took his degree[65] and left the University.\r\n\r\nHe \"kept\" for a term or two in lodgings, over Bacon[66] the\r\ntobacconist's; not, however, over the shop in the Market Place, so well\r\nknown to Cambridge men, but in Sydney Street. For the rest of his time\r\nhe had pleasant rooms on the south side of the first court of\r\nChrist's.[67]\r\n\r\nWhat determined the choice of this college for his brother Erasmus and\r\nhimself I have no means of knowing. Erasmus the elder, their\r\ngrandfather, had been at St. John's, and this college might have been\r\nreasonably selected for them, being connected with Shrewsbury School.\r\nBut the life of an undergraduate at St. John's seems, in those days, to\r\nhave been a troubled one, if I may judge from the fact that a relative\r\nof mine migrated thence to Christ's to escape the harassing discipline\r\nof the place.\r\n\r\nDarwin seems to have found no difficulty in living at peace with all men\r\nin and out of office at Lady Margaret's elder foundation. The impression\r\nof a contemporary of my father's is that Christ's in their day was a\r\npleasant, fairly quiet college, with some tendency towards \"horsiness\";\r\nmany of the men made a custom of going to Newmarket during the races,\r\nthough betting was not a regular practice. In this they were by no means\r\ndiscouraged by the Senior Tutor, Mr. Shaw, who was himself generally to\r\nbe seen on the Heath on these occasions.\r\n\r\nNor were the ecclesiastical authorities of the College over strict. I\r\nhave heard my father tell how at evening chapel the Dean used to read\r\nalternate verses of the Psalms, without making even a pretence of\r\nwaiting for the congregation to take their share. And when the Lesson\r\nwas a lengthy one, he would rise and go on with the Canticles after the\r\nscholar had read fifteen or twenty verses.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that my father often spoke of his Cambridge life as if it\r\nhad been so much time wasted,[68] forgetting that, although the set\r\nstudies of the place were barren enough for him, he yet gained in the\r\nhighest degree the best advantages of a University life--the contact\r\nwith men and an opportunity for mental growth. It is true that he valued\r\nat its highest the advantages which he gained from associating with\r\nProfessor Henslow and some others, but he seemed to consider this as a\r\nchance outcome of his life at Cambridge, not an advantage for which\r\n_Alma Mater_ could claim any credit. One of my father's Cambridge\r\nfriends was the late Mr. J. M. Herbert, County Court Judge for South\r\nWales, from whom I was fortunate enough to obtain some notes which help\r\nus to gain an idea of how my father impressed his contemporaries. Mr.\r\nHerbert writes:--\r\n\r\n\"It would be idle for me to speak of his vast intellectual powers ...\r\nbut I cannot end this cursory and rambling sketch without testifying,\r\nand I doubt not all his surviving college friends would concur with me,\r\nthat he was the most genial, warm-hearted, generous, and affectionate of\r\nfriends; that his sympathies were with all that was good and true; and\r\nthat he had a cordial hatred for everything false, or vile, or cruel, or\r\nmean, or dishonourable. He was not only great, but pre-eminently good,\r\nand just, and lovable.\"\r\n\r\nTwo anecdotes told by Mr. Herbert show that my father's feeling for\r\nsuffering, whether of man or beast, was as strong in him as a young man\r\nas it was in later years: \"Before he left Cambridge he told me that he\r\nhad made up his mind not to shoot any more; that he had had two days'\r\nshooting at his friend's, Mr. Owen of Woodhouse; and that on the second\r\nday, when going over some of the ground they had beaten on the day\r\nbefore, he picked up a bird not quite dead, but lingering from a shot\r\nit had received on the previous day; and that it had made and left such\r\na painful impression on his mind, that he could not reconcile it to his\r\nconscience to continue to derive pleasure from a sport which inflicted\r\nsuch cruel suffering.\"\r\n\r\nTo realise the strength of the feeling that led to this resolve, we must\r\nremember how passionate was his love of sport. We must recall the boy\r\nshooting his first snipe,[69] and trembling with excitement so that he\r\ncould hardly reload his gun. Or think of such a sentence as, \"Upon my\r\nsoul, it is only about a fortnight to the 'First,' then if there is a\r\nbliss on earth that is it.\"[70]\r\n\r\nHis old college friends agree in speaking with affectionate warmth of\r\nhis pleasant, genial temper as a young man. From what they have been\r\nable to tell me, I gain the impression of a young man overflowing with\r\nanimal spirits--leading a varied healthy life--not over-industrious in\r\nthe set studies of the place, but full of other pursuits, which were\r\nfollowed with a rejoicing enthusiasm. Entomology, riding, shooting in\r\nthe fens, suppers and card-playing, music at King's Chapel, engravings\r\nat the Fitzwilliam Museum, walks with Professor Henslow--all combined to\r\nfill up a happy life. He seems to have infected others with his\r\nenthusiasm. Mr. Herbert relates how, while on a reading-party at\r\nBarmouth, he was pressed into the service of \"the science\"--as my father\r\ncalled collecting beetles:--\r\n\r\n\"He armed me with a bottle of alcohol, in which I had to drop any beetle\r\nwhich struck me as not of a common kind. I performed this duty with some\r\ndiligence in my constitutional walks; but, alas! my powers of\r\ndiscrimination seldom enabled mo to secure a prize--the usual result, on\r\nhis examining the contents of my bottle, being an exclamation, 'Well,\r\nold Cherbury'[71] (the nickname he gave me, and by which he usually\r\naddressed me), 'none of these will do.'\" Again, the Rev. T. Butler, who\r\nwas one of the Barmouth reading-party in 1828, says: \"He inoculated me\r\nwith a taste for Botany which has stuck by me all my life.\"\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Watkins, another old college friend of my father's,\r\nremembered him unearthing beetles in the willows between Cambridge and\r\nGrantchester, and speaks of a certain beetle the remembrance of whose\r\nname is \"Crux major.\"[72] How enthusiastically must my father have\r\nexulted over this beetle to have impressed its name on a companion so\r\nthat he remembers it after half a century!\r\n\r\nHe became intimate with Henslow, the Professor of Botany, and through\r\nhim with some other older members of the University. \"But,\" Mr. Herbert\r\nwrites, \"he always kept up the closest connection with the friends of\r\nhis own standing; and at our frequent social gatherings--at breakfast,\r\nwine or supper parties--he was ever one of the most cheerful, the most\r\npopular, and the most welcome.\"\r\n\r\nMy father formed one of a club for dining once a week, called the\r\nGlutton Club, the members, besides himself and Mr. Herbert (from whom I\r\nquote), being Whitley of St. John's, now Honorary Canon of Durham;[73]\r\nHeaviside of Sydney, now Canon of Norwich; Lovett Cameron of Trinity,\r\nsometime vicar of Shoreham; R. Blane of Trinity,[74] who held a high\r\npost during the Crimean war, H. Lowe[75] (afterwards Sherbrooke) of\r\nTrinity Hall; and F. Watkins of Emmanuel, afterwards Archdeacon of York.\r\nThe origin of the club's name seems already to have become involved in\r\nobscurity; it certainly implied no unusual luxury in the weekly\r\ngatherings.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the meetings seemed to have been successful, and to have\r\nended with \"a game of mild vingt-et-un.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert speaks strongly of my father's love of music, and adds,\r\n\"What gave him the greatest delight was some grand symphony or overture\r\nof Mozart's or Beethoven's, with their full harmonies.\" On one occasion\r\nHerbert remembers \"accompanying him to the afternoon service at King's,\r\nwhen we heard a very beautiful anthem. At the end of one of the parts,\r\nwhich was exceedingly impressive, he turned round to me and said, with a\r\ndeep sigh, 'How's your backbone?'\" He often spoke in later years of a\r\nfeeling of coldness or shivering in his back on hearing beautiful music.\r\n\r\nBesides a love of music, he had certainly at this time a love of fine\r\nliterature; and Mr. Cameron tells me that my father took much pleasure\r\nin Shakespeare readings carried on in his rooms at Christ's. He also\r\nspeaks of Darwin's \"great liking for first-class line engravings,\r\nespecially those of Raphael Morghen and Mueller; and he spent hours in\r\nthe Fitzwilliam Museum in looking over the prints in that collection.\"\r\n\r\nMy father's letters to Fox show how sorely oppressed he felt by the\r\nreading for an examination. His despair over mathematics must have been\r\nprofound, when he expresses a hope that Fox's silence is due to \"your\r\nbeing ten fathoms deep in the Mathematics; and if you are, God help you,\r\nfor so am I, only with this difference, I stick fast in the mud at the\r\nbottom, and there I shall remain.\" Mr. Herbert says: \"He had, I imagine,\r\nno natural turn for mathematics, and he gave up his mathematical reading\r\nbefore he had mastered the first part of algebra, having had a special\r\nquarrel with Surds and the Binomial Theorem.\"\r\n\r\nWe get some evidence from my father's letters to Fox of his intention of\r\ngoing into the Church. \"I am glad,\" he writes,[76] \"to hear that you are\r\nreading divinity. I should like to know what books you are reading, and\r\nyour opinions about them; you need not be afraid of preaching to me\r\nprematurely.\" Mr. Herbert's sketch shows how doubts arose in my father's\r\nmind as to the possibility of his taking Orders. He writes, \"We had an\r\nearnest conversation about going into Holy Orders; and I remember his\r\nasking me, with reference to the question put by the Bishop in the\r\nOrdination Service, 'Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the\r\nHoly Spirit, &c.,' whether I could answer in the affirmative, and on my\r\nsaying I could not, he said, 'Neither can I, and therefore I cannot take\r\norders.'\" This conversation appears to have taken place in 1829, and if\r\nso, the doubts here expressed must have been quieted, for in May 1830,\r\nhe speaks of having some thoughts of reading divinity with Henslow.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of his Cambridge letters are addressed by my father\r\nto his cousin, William Darwin Fox. My father's letters show clearly\r\nenough how genuine the friendship was. In after years, distance, large\r\nfamilies, and ill-health on both sides, checked the intercourse; but a\r\nwarm feeling of friendship remained. The correspondence was never quite\r\ndropped and continued till Mr. Fox's death in 1880. Mr. Fox took orders,\r\nand worked as a country clergyman until forced by ill-health to leave\r\nhis living in Delamere Forest. His love of natural history was strong,\r\nand he became a skilled fancier of many kinds of birds, &c. The index to\r\n_Animals and Plants_, and my father's later correspondence, show how\r\nmuch help he received from his old College friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. M. Herbert._ September 14, 1828.[77]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR OLD CHERBURY,--I am about to fulfil my promise of writing to\r\nyou, but I am sorry to add there is a very selfish motive at the bottom.\r\nI am going to ask you a great favour, and you cannot imagine how much\r\nyou will oblige me by procuring some more specimens of some insects\r\nwhich I dare say I can describe. In the first place, I must inform you\r\nthat I have taken some of the rarest of the British Insects, and their\r\nbeing found near Barmouth, is quite unknown to the Entomological world:\r\nI think I shall write and inform some of the crack entomologists.\r\n\r\nBut now for business. _Several_ more specimens, if you can procure them\r\nwithout much trouble, of the following insects:--The violet-black\r\ncoloured beetle, found on Craig Storm,[78] under stones, also a large\r\nsmooth black one very like it; a bluish metallic-coloured dung-beetle,\r\nwhich is _very_ common on the hill-sides; also, if you _would_ be so\r\nvery kind as to cross the ferry, and you will find a great number under\r\nthe stones on the waste land of a long, smooth, jet-black beetle (a\r\ngreat many of these); also, in the same situation, a very small pinkish\r\ninsect, with black spots, with a curved thorax projecting beyond the\r\nhead; also, upon the marshy land over the ferry, near the sea, under old\r\nsea weed, stones, &c., you will find a small yellowish transparent\r\nbeetle, with two or four blackish marks on the back. Under these stones\r\nthere are two sorts, one much darker than the other; the lighter\r\ncoloured is that which I want. These last two insects are _excessively\r\nrare_, and you will really _extremely_ oblige me by taking all this\r\ntrouble pretty soon. Remember me most kindly to Butler,[79] tell him of\r\nmy success, and I dare say both of you will easily recognise these\r\ninsects. I hope his caterpillars go on well. I think many of the\r\nChrysalises are well worth keeping. I really am quite ashamed [of] so\r\nlong a letter all about my own concerns; but do return good for evil,\r\nand send me a long account of all your proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn the first week I killed seventy-five head of game--a very\r\ncontemptible number--but there are very few birds. I killed, however, a\r\nbrace of black game. Since then I have been staying at the Fox's, near\r\nDerby; it is a very pleasant house, and the music meeting went off very\r\nwell. I want to hear how Yates likes his gun, and what use he has made\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIf the bottle is not large you can buy another for me, and when you pass\r\nthrough Shrewsbury you can leave these treasures, and I hope, if you\r\npossibly can, you will stay a day or two with me, as I hope I need not\r\nsay how glad I shall be to see you again. Fox remarked what deuced good\r\nnatured fellows your friends at Barmouth must be; and if I did not know\r\nthat you and Butler were so, I would not think of giving you so much\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following January we find him looking forward with pleasure to\r\nthe beginning of another year of his Cambridge life: he writes to Fox,\r\nwho had passed his examination:--\r\n\r\n\"I do so wish I were now in Cambridge (a very selfish wish, however, as\r\nI was not with you in all your troubles and misery), to join in all the\r\nglory and happiness, which dangers gone by can give. How we would talk,\r\nwalk, and entomologise! Sappho should be the best of bitches, and Dash,\r\nof dogs; then should be 'peace on earth, good will to men,'--which, by\r\nthe way, I always think the most perfect description of happiness that\r\nwords can give.\"\r\n\r\nLater on in the Lent term he writes to Fox:--\r\n\r\n\"I am leading a quiet everyday sort of a life; a little of Gibbon's\r\nHistory in the morning, and a good deal of _Van John_ in the evening;\r\nthis, with an occasional ride with Simcox and constitutional with\r\nWhitley, makes up the regular routine of my days. I see a good deal both\r\nof Herbert and Whitley, and the more I see of them increases every day\r\nthe respect I have for their excellent understandings and dispositions.\r\nThey have been giving some very gay parties, nearly sixty men there both\r\nevenings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to W. D. Fox._ Christ's College, April 1 [1829].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FOX--In your letter to Holden you are pleased to observe \"that\r\nof all the blackguards you ever met with I am the greatest.\" Upon this\r\nobservation I shall make no remarks, excepting that I must give you all\r\ndue credit for acting on it most rigidly. And now I should like to know\r\nin what one particular are you less of a blackguard than I am? You idle\r\nold wretch, why have you not answered my last letter, which I am sure I\r\nforwarded to Clifton nearly three weeks ago? If I was not really very\r\nanxious to hear what you are doing, I should have allowed you to remain\r\ntill you thought it worth while to treat me like a gentleman. And now\r\nhaving vented my spleen in scolding you, and having told you, what you\r\nmust know, how very much and how anxiously I want to hear how you and\r\nyour family are getting on at Clifton, the purport of this letter is\r\nfinished. If you did but know how often I think of you, and how often I\r\nregret your absence, I am sure I should have heard from you long enough\r\nago.\r\n\r\nI find Cambridge rather stupid, and as I know scarcely any one that\r\nwalks, and this joined with my lips not being quite so well, has reduced\r\nme to a sort of hybernation.... I have caught Mr. Harbour[80] letting\r\n---- have the first pick of the beetles; accordingly we have made our\r\nfinal adieus, my part in the affecting scene consisted in telling him he\r\nwas a d----d rascal, and signifying I should kick him down the stairs if\r\never he appeared in my rooms again. It seemed altogether mightily to\r\nsurprise the young gentleman. I have no news to tell you; indeed, when a\r\ncorrespondence has been broken off like ours has been, it is difficult\r\nto make the first start again. Last night there was a terrible fire at\r\nLinton, eleven miles from Cambridge. Seeing the reflection so plainly in\r\nthe sky, Hall, Woodyeare, Turner, and myself thought we would ride and\r\nsee it. We set out at half-past nine, and rode like incarnate devils\r\nthere, and did not return till two in the morning. Altogether it was a\r\nmost awful sight. I cannot conclude without telling you, that of all the\r\nblackguards I ever met with, you are the greatest and the best.\r\n\r\nIn July 1829 he had written to Fox:--\r\n\r\n\"I must read for my Little-go. Graham smiled and bowed so very civilly,\r\nwhen he told me that he was one of the six appointed to make the\r\nexamination stricter, and that they were determined this would make it a\r\nvery different thing from any previous examination, that from all this I\r\nam sure it will be the very devil to pay amongst all idle men and\r\nentomologists.\"\r\n\r\nBut things were not so bad as he feared, and in March 1830, he could\r\nwrite to the same correspondent:--\r\n\r\n\"I am through my Little-go!!! I am too much exalted to humble myself by\r\napologising for not having written before. But I assure you before I\r\nwent in, and when my nerves were in a shattered and weak condition, your\r\ninjured person often rose before my eyes and taunted me with my\r\nidleness. But I am through, through, through. I could write the whole\r\nsheet full with this delightful word. I went in yesterday, and have\r\njust heard the joyful news. I shall not know for a week which class I am\r\nin. The whole examination is carried on in a different system. It has\r\none grand advantage--being over in one day. They are rather strict, and\r\nask a wonderful number of questions.\r\n\r\nAnd now I want to know something about your plans; of course you intend\r\ncoming up here: what fun we will have together; what beetles we will\r\ncatch; it will do my heart good to go once more together to some of our\r\nold haunts. I have two very promising pupils in Entomology, and we will\r\nmake regular campaigns into the Fens. Heaven protect the beetles and Mr.\r\nJenyns, for we won't leave him a pair in the whole country. My new\r\nCabinet is come down, and a gay little affair it is.\"\r\n\r\nIn August he was diligently amusing himself in North Wales, finding no\r\ntime to write to Fox, because:--\r\n\r\n\"This is literally the first idle day I have had to myself; for on the\r\nrainy days I go fishing, on the good ones entomologising.\"\r\n\r\nNovember found him preparing for his degree, of which process he writes\r\ndolefully:--\r\n\r\n\"I have so little time at present, and am so disgusted by reading, that\r\nI have not the heart to write to anybody. I have only written once home\r\nsince I came up. This must excuse me for not having answered your three\r\nletters, for which I am really very much obliged....\r\n\r\n\"I have not stuck an insect this term, and scarcely opened a case. If I\r\nhad time I would have sent you the insects which I have so long\r\npromised; but really I have not spirits or time to do anything. Reading\r\nmakes me quite desperate; the plague of getting up all my subjects is\r\nnext thing to intolerable, Henslow is my tutor, and a most _admirable_\r\none he makes; the hour with him is the pleasantest in the whole day. I\r\nthink he is quite the most perfect man I ever met with. I have been to\r\nsome very pleasant parties there this term. His good-nature is\r\nunbounded.\"\r\n\r\nThe new year brought relief, and on January 23, 1831, he wrote to tell\r\nFox that he was through his examination.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable, both before\r\nand afterwards. I recollect you were sufficiently wretched before, and I\r\ncan assure [you], I am now; and what makes it the more ridiculous is, I\r\nknow not what about. I believe it is a beautiful provision of nature to\r\nmake one regret the less leaving so pleasant a place as Cambridge; and\r\namongst all its pleasures--I say it for once and for all--none so great\r\nas my friendship with you. I sent you a newspaper yesterday, in which\r\nyou will see what a good place--tenth--I have got in the Poll. As for\r\nChrist's, did you ever see such a college for producing Captains and\r\nApostles?[81] There are no men either at Emmanuel or Christ's plucked.\r\nCameron is gulfed,[82] together with other three Trinity scholars! My\r\nplans are not at all settled. I think I shall keep this term, and then\r\ngo and economise at Shrewsbury, return and take my degree.\r\n\r\n\"A man may be excused for writing so much about himself when he has just\r\npassed the examination; so you must excuse [me]. And on the same\r\nprinciple do you write a letter brimful of yourself and plans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPOINTMENT TO THE 'BEAGLE.'\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to Captain Fitz-Roy, before the _Beagle_ sailed,\r\nmy father wrote, \"What a glorious day the 4th of November[83] will be to\r\nme--my second life will then commence, and it shall be as a birthday for\r\nthe rest of my life.\"\r\n\r\nForemost in the chain of circumstances which led to his appointment to\r\nthe _Beagle_, was his friendship with Professor Henslow, of which the\r\nautobiography gives a sufficient account.[84]\r\n\r\nAn extract from a pocket-book, in which Darwin briefly recorded the\r\nchief events of his life, gives the history of his introduction to that\r\nscience which was so soon to be his chief occupation--geology.\r\n\r\n\"1831. _Christmas._--Passed my examination for B.A. degree and kept the\r\ntwo following terms. During these months lived much with Professor\r\nHenslow, often dining with him and walking with him; became slightly\r\nacquainted with several of the learned men in Cambridge, which much\r\nquickened the zeal which dinner parties and hunting had not destroyed.\r\nIn the spring Henslow persuaded me to think of Geology, and introduced\r\nme to Sedgwick. During Midsummer geologized a little in Shropshire.\"\r\n\r\nThis geological work was doubtless of importance as giving him some\r\npractical experience, and perhaps of more importance in helping to give\r\nhim some confidence in himself. In July of the same year, 1831, he was\r\n\"working like a tiger\" at Geology, and trying to make a map of\r\nShropshire, but not finding it \"as easy as I expected.\"\r\n\r\nIn writing to Henslow about the same time, he gives some account of his\r\nwork:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been working at so many things that I have not got on much with\r\ngeology. I suspect the first expedition I take, clinometer and hammer in\r\nhand, will send me back very little wiser and a good deal more puzzled\r\nthan when I started. As yet I have only indulged in hypotheses, but they\r\nare such powerful ones that I suppose, if they were put into action but\r\nfor one day, the world would come to an end.\"\r\n\r\nHe was evidently most keen to get to work with Sedgwick, who had\r\npromised to take him on a geological tour in North Wales, for he wrote\r\nto Henslow: \"I have not heard from Professor Sedgwick, so I am afraid he\r\nwill not pay the Severn formations a visit. I hope and trust you did\r\nyour best to urge him.\"\r\n\r\nMy father has given in his _Recollections_ some account of this Tour;\r\nthere too we read of the projected excursion to the Canaries.\r\n\r\nIn April 1831, he writes to Fox: \"At present I talk, think, and dream of\r\na scheme I have almost hatched of going to the Canary Islands. I have\r\nlong had a wish of seeing tropical scenery and vegetation, and,\r\naccording to Humboldt, Teneriffe is a very pretty specimen.\" And again\r\nin May: \"As for my Canary scheme, it is rash of you to ask questions; my\r\nother friends most sincerely wish me there, I plague them so with\r\ntalking about tropical scenery, &c. Eyton will go next summer, and I am\r\nlearning Spanish.\"\r\n\r\nLater on in the summer the scheme took more definite form, and the date\r\nseems to have been fixed for June 1832. He got information in London\r\nabout passage-money, and in July was working at Spanish and calling Fox\r\n\"un grandisimo lebron,\" in proof of his knowledge of the language. But\r\neven then he seems to have had some doubts about his companions' zeal,\r\nfor he writes to Henslow (July 27, 1831): \"I hope you continue to fan\r\nyour Canary ardour. I read and re-read Humboldt;[85] do you do the same.\r\nI am sure nothing will prevent us seeing the Great Dragon Tree.\"\r\n\r\nGeological work and Teneriffe dreams carried him through the summer,\r\ntill on returning from Barmouth for the sacred 1st of September, he\r\nreceived the offer of appointment as Naturalist to the _Beagle_.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the pocket-book will be a help in reading the\r\nletters:--\r\n\r\n\"Returned to Shrewsbury at end of August. Refused offer of voyage.\r\n\r\n\"_September._--Went to Maer, returned with Uncle Jos. to Shrewsbury,\r\nthence to Cambridge. London.\r\n\r\n\"_11th._--Went with Captain Fitz-Roy in steamer to Plymouth to see the\r\n_Beagle_.\r\n\r\n\"_22nd._--Returned to Shrewsbury, passing through Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\"_October 2nd._--Took leave of my home. Stayed in London.\r\n\r\n\"_24th._--Reached Plymouth.\r\n\r\n\"_October and November._--These months very miserable.\r\n\r\n\"_December 10th._--Sailed, but were obliged to put back.\r\n\r\n\"_21st._--Put to sea again, and were driven back.\r\n\r\n\"_27th._--Sailed from England on our Circumnavigation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_George Peacock[86] to J. S. Henslow_ [1831].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HENSLOW--Captain Fitz-Roy is going out to survey the southern\r\ncoast of Tierra del Fuego, and afterwards to visit many of the South Sea\r\nIslands, and to return by the Indian Archipelago. The vessel is fitted\r\nout expressly for scientific purposes, combined with the survey; it will\r\nfurnish, therefore, a rare opportunity for a naturalist, and it would be\r\na great misfortune that it should be lost.\r\n\r\nAn offer has been made to me to recommend a proper person to go out as a\r\nnaturalist with this expedition; he will be treated with every\r\nconsideration. The Captain is a young man of very pleasing manners (a\r\nnephew of the Duke of Grafton), of great zeal in his profession, and who\r\nis very highly spoken of; if Leonard Jenyns could go, what treasures he\r\nmight bring home with him, as the ship would be placed at his disposal\r\nwhenever his inquiries made it necessary or desirable. In the absence of\r\nso accomplished a naturalist, is there any person whom you could\r\nstrongly recommend? he must be such a person as would do credit to our\r\nrecommendation. Do think of this subject; it would be a serious loss to\r\nthe cause of natural science if this fine opportunity was lost.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the foregoing letter were communicated to Darwin by\r\nHenslow (August 24th, 1831):--\r\n\r\n\"I have been asked by Peacock, who will read and forward this to you\r\nfrom London, to recommend him a Naturalist as companion to Captain\r\nFitz-Roy, employed by Government to survey the southern extremity of\r\nAmerica. I have stated that I consider you to be the best qualified\r\nperson I know of who is likely to undertake such a situation. I state\r\nthis not in the supposition of your being a _finished_ naturalist, but\r\nas amply qualified for collecting, observing, and noting anything worthy\r\nto be noted in Natural History. Peacock has the appointment at his\r\ndisposal, and if he cannot find a man willing to take the office, the\r\nopportunity will probably be lost. Captain Fitz-Roy wants a man (I\r\nunderstand) more as a companion than a mere collector, and would not\r\ntake any one, however good a naturalist, who was not recommended to him\r\nlikewise as a _gentleman_. Particulars of salary, &c., I know nothing.\r\nThe voyage is to last two years, and if you take plenty of books with\r\nyou, anything you please may be done. You will have ample opportunities\r\nat command. In short, I suppose there never was a finer chance for a man\r\nof zeal and spirit; Captain Fitz-Roy is a young man. What I wish you to\r\ndo is instantly to come and consult with Peacock (at No. 7 Suffolk\r\nStreet, Pall Mall East, or else at the University Club), and learn\r\nfurther particulars. Don't put on any modest doubts or fears about your\r\ndisqualifications, for I assure you I think you are the very man they\r\nare in search of; so conceive yourself to be tapped on the shoulder by\r\nyour bum-bailiff and affectionate friend, J. S. HENSLOW.\"\r\n\r\nOn the strength of Henslow's recommendation, Peacock offered the post to\r\nDarwin, who wrote from Shrewsbury to Henslow (August 30, 1831):\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Peacock's letter arrived on Saturday, and I received it late\r\nyesterday evening. As far as my own mind is concerned, I should, I think\r\n_certainly_, most gladly have accepted the opportunity which you so\r\nkindly have offered me. But my father, although he does not decidedly\r\nrefuse me, gives such strong advice against going, that I should not be\r\ncomfortable if I did not follow it.\r\n\r\n\"My father's objections are these: the unfitting me to settle down as a\r\nClergyman, my little habit of seafaring, _the shortness of the time_,\r\nand the chance of my not suiting Captain Fitz-Roy. It is certainly a\r\nvery serious objection, the very short time for all my preparations, as\r\nnot only body but mind wants making up for such an undertaking. But if\r\nit had not been for my father I would have taken all risks. What was the\r\nreason that a Naturalist was not long ago fixed upon? I am very much\r\nobliged for the trouble you have had about it; there certainly could not\r\nhave been a better opportunity....\r\n\r\n\"Even if I was to go, my father disliking would take away all energy,\r\nand I should want a good stock of that. Again I must thank you, it adds\r\na little to the heavy but pleasant load of gratitude which I owe to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written by Darwin from Maer, the house of his\r\nuncle Josiah Wedgwood the younger. It is plain that at first he intended\r\nto await a written reply from Dr. Darwin, and that the expedition to\r\nShrewsbury, mentioned in the _Autobiography_, was an afterthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Maer] August 31 [1831].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FATHER--I am afraid I am going to make you again very\r\nuncomfortable. But, upon consideration, I think you will excuse me once\r\nagain stating my opinions on the offer of the voyage. My excuse and\r\nreason is the different way all the Wedgwoods view the subject from what\r\nyou and my sisters do.\r\n\r\nI have given Uncle Jos[87] what I fervently trust is an accurate and\r\nfull list of your objections, and he is kind enough to give his opinions\r\non all. The list and his answers will be enclosed. But may I beg of you\r\none favour, it will be doing me the greatest kindness, if you will send\r\nme a decided answer, yes or no? If the latter, I should be most\r\nungrateful if I did not implicitly yield to your better judgment, and to\r\nthe kindest indulgence you have shown me all through my life; and you\r\nmay rely upon it I will never mention the subject again. If your answer\r\nshould be yes; I will go directly to Henslow and consult deliberately\r\nwith him, and then come to Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\nThe danger appears to me and all the Wedgwoods not great. The expense\r\ncan not be serious, and the time I do not think, anyhow, would be more\r\nthrown away than if I stayed at home. But pray do not consider that I am\r\nso bent on going that I would for one _single moment_ hesitate, if you\r\nthought that after a short period you should continue uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI must again state I cannot think it would unfit me hereafter for a\r\nsteady life. I do hope this letter will not give you much uneasiness. I\r\nsend it by the car to-morrow morning; if you make up your mind directly\r\nwill you send me an answer on the following day by the same means? If\r\nthis letter should not find you at home, I hope you will answer as soon\r\nas you conveniently can.\r\n\r\nI do not know what to say about Uncle Jos' kindness; I never can forget\r\nhow he interests himself about me.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear father, your affectionate son,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere follow the objections above referred to:--\r\n\r\n\"(1.) Disreputable to my character as a Clergyman hereafter.\r\n\r\n\"(2.) A wild scheme.\r\n\r\n\"(3.) That they must have offered to many others before me the place of\r\nNaturalist.\r\n\r\n\"(4.) And from its not being accepted there must be some serious\r\nobjection to the vessel or expedition.\r\n\r\n\"(5.) That I should never settle down to a steady life hereafter.\r\n\r\n\"(6.) That my accommodations would be most uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"(7.) That you [_i.e._ Dr. Darwin] should consider it as again changing\r\nmy profession.\r\n\r\n\"(8.) That it would be a useless undertaking.\"\r\n\r\nJosiah Wedgwood having demolished this curious array of argument, and\r\nthe Doctor having been converted, Darwin left home for Cambridge. On his\r\narrival at the Red Lion he sent a messenger to Henslow with the\r\nfollowing note (September 2nd):--\r\n\r\n\"I am just arrived; you will guess the reason. My father has changed his\r\nmind. I trust the place is not given away.\r\n\r\nI am very much fatigued, and am going to bed.\r\n\r\nI dare say you have not yet got my second letter.\r\n\r\nHow soon shall I come to you in the morning? Send a verbal answer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Miss Susan Darwin._ Cambridge [September 4, 1831].\r\n\r\n... The whole of yesterday I spent with Henslow, thinking of what is to\r\nbe done, and that I find is a great deal. By great good luck I know a\r\nman of the name of Wood, nephew of Lord Londonderry. He is a great\r\nfriend of Captain Fitz-Roy, and has written to him about me. I heard a\r\npart of Captain Fitz-Roy's letter, dated some time ago, in which he\r\nsays: 'I have a right good set of officers, and most of my men have been\r\nthere before.' It seems he has been there for the last few years; he was\r\nthen second in command with the same vessel that he has now chosen. He\r\nis only twenty-three years old, but [has] seen a deal of service, and\r\nwon the gold medal at Portsmouth. The Admiralty say his maps are most\r\nperfect. He had choice of two vessels, and he chose the smallest.\r\nHenslow will give me letters to all travellers in town whom he thinks\r\nmay assist me.\r\n\r\n... I write as if it was settled, but Henslow tells me _by no means_ to\r\nmake up my mind till I have had long conversations with Captains\r\nBeaufort and Fitz-Roy. Good-bye. You will hear from me constantly.\r\nDirect 17 Spring Gardens. _Tell nobody_ in Shropshire yet. Be sure not.\r\n\r\nI was so tired that evening I was in Shrewsbury that I thanked none of\r\nyou for your kindness half so much as I felt. Love to my father.\r\n\r\nThe reason I don't want people told in Shropshire: in case I should not\r\ngo, it will make it more flat.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the transaction, a hitch occurred. Captain Fitz-Roy, it\r\nseems, wished to take a friend (Mr. Chester) as companion on the voyage,\r\nand accordingly wrote to Cambridge in such a discouraging strain, that\r\nDarwin gave up hope and hardly thought it worth his while to go to\r\nLondon (September 5). Fortunately, however, he did go, and found that\r\nMr. Chester could not leave England. When the physiognomical, or\r\nnose-difficulty (Autobiography, p. 26.) occurred, I have no means of\r\nknowing: for at this interview Fitz-Roy was evidently well-disposed\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\nMy father wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"He offers me to go shares in everything in his cabin if I like to come,\r\nand every sort of accommodation I can have, but they will not be\r\nnumerous. He says nothing would be so miserable for him as having me\r\nwith him if I was uncomfortable, as in a small vessel we must be thrown\r\ntogether, and thought it his duty to state everything in the worst point\r\nof view. I think I shall go on Sunday to Plymouth to see the vessel.\r\n\r\n\"There is something most extremely attractive in his manners and way of\r\ncoming straight to the point. If I live with him, he says I must live\r\npoorly--no wine, and the plainest dinners. The scheme is not certainly\r\nso good as Peacock describes. Captain Fitz-Roy advises me not [to] make\r\nup my mind quite yet, but that, seriously, he thinks it will have much\r\nmore pleasure than pain for me....\r\n\r\n\"The want of room is decidedly the most serious objection; but Captain\r\nFitz-Roy (probably owing to Wood's letter) seems determined to make me\r\n[as] comfortable as he possibly can. I like his manner of proceeding. He\r\nasked me at once, 'Shall you bear being told that I want the cabin to\r\nmyself--when I want to be alone? If we treat each other this way, I hope\r\nwe shall suit; if not, probably we should wish each other at the\r\ndevil.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Miss Susan Darwin._ London [September 6, 1831].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SUSAN--Again I am going to trouble you. I suspect, if I keep on\r\nat this rate, you will sincerely wish me at Tierra del Fuego, or any\r\nother Terra, but England. First, I will give my commissions. Tell Nancy\r\nto make me some twelve instead of eight shirts. Tell Edward to send me\r\nup in my carpet-bag (he can slip the key in the bag tied to some\r\nstring), my slippers, a pair of lightish walking-shoes, my Spanish\r\nbooks, my new microscope (about six inches long and three or four deep),\r\nwhich must have cotton stuffed inside; my geological compass; my father\r\nknows that; a little book, if I have got it in my bed room--_Taxidermy_.\r\nAsk my father if he thinks there would be any objection to my taking\r\narsenic for a little time, as my hands are not quite well, and I have\r\nalways observed that if I once get them well, and change my manner of\r\nliving about the same time, they will generally remain well. What is the\r\ndose? Tell Edward my gun is dirty. What is Erasmus's direction? Tell me\r\nif you think there is time to write and to receive an answer before I\r\nstart, as I should like particularly to know what he thinks about it. I\r\nsuppose you do not know Sir J. Mackintosh's direction?\r\n\r\nI write all this as if it was settled, but it is not more than it was,\r\nexcepting that from Captain Fitz-Roy wishing me so much to go, and, from\r\nhis kindness, I feel a predestination I shall start. I spent a very\r\npleasant evening with him yesterday. He must be more than twenty-three\r\nyears old; he is of a slight figure, and a dark but handsome edition of\r\nMr. Kynaston, and, according to my notions, pre-eminently good manners.\r\nHe is all for economy, excepting on one point--viz., fire-arms. He\r\nrecommends me strongly to get a case of pistols like his, which cost\r\nL60!! and never to go on shore anywhere without loaded ones, and he is\r\ndoubting about a rifle; he says I cannot appreciate the luxury of fresh\r\nmeat here. Of course I shall buy nothing till everything is settled;\r\nbut I work all day long at my lists, putting in and striking out\r\narticles. This is the first really cheerful day I have spent since I\r\nreceived the letter, and it all is owing to the sort of involuntary\r\nconfidence I place in my _beau ideal_ of a Captain.\r\n\r\nWe stop at Teneriffe. His object is to stop at as many places as\r\npossible. He takes out twenty chronometers, and it will be a \"sin\" not\r\nto settle the longitude. He tells me to get it down in writing at the\r\nAdmiralty that I have the free choice to leave as soon and whenever I\r\nlike. I daresay you expect I shall turn back at the Madeira; if I have a\r\nmorsel of stomach left, I won't give up. Excuse my so often troubling\r\nand writing: the one is of great utility, the other a great amusement to\r\nme. Most likely I shall write to-morrow. Answer by return of post. Love\r\nto my father, dearest Susan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. S. Henslow._ Devonport [November 15, 1831].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HENSLOW--The orders are come down from the Admiralty, and\r\neverything is finally settled. We positively sail the last day of this\r\nmonth, and I think before that time the vessel will be ready. She looks\r\nmost beautiful, even a landsman must admire her. _We_ all think her the\r\nmost perfect vessel ever turned out of the Dockyard. One thing is\r\ncertain, no vessel has been fitted out so expensively, and with so much\r\ncare. Everything that can be made so is of mahogany, and nothing can\r\nexceed the neatness and beauty of all the accommodations. The\r\ninstructions are very general, and leave a great deal to the Captain's\r\ndiscretion and judgment, paying a substantial as well as a verbal\r\ncompliment to him....\r\n\r\nNo vessel ever left England with such a set of Chronometers, viz.\r\ntwenty-four, all very good ones. In short, everything is well, and I\r\nhave only now to pray for the sickness to moderate its fierceness, and I\r\nshall do very well. Yet I should not call it one of the very best\r\nopportunities for natural history that has ever occurred. The absolute\r\nwant of room is an evil that nothing can surmount. I think L. Jenyns did\r\nvery wisely in not coming, that is judging from my own feelings, for I\r\nam sure if I had left college some few years, or been those years older\r\nI _never_ could have endured it. The officers (excepting the Captain)\r\nare like the freshest freshmen, that is in their manners, in everything\r\nelse widely different. Remember me most kindly to him, and tell him if\r\never he dreams in the night of palm-trees, he may in the morning comfort\r\nhimself with the assurance that the voyage would not have suited him.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your advice, _de Mathematicis_. I suspect when\r\nI am struggling with a triangle, I shall often wish myself in your\r\nroom, and as for those wicked sulky surds, I do not know what I\r\nshall do without you to conjure them. My time passes away very\r\npleasantly. I know one or two pleasant people, foremost of whom is Mr.\r\nThunder-and-lightning Harris,[88] whom I dare say you have heard of. My\r\nchief employment is to go on board the _Beagle_, and try to look as much\r\nlike a sailor as I can. I have no evidence of having taken in man, woman\r\nor child.\r\n\r\nI am going to ask you to do one more commission, and I trust it will be\r\nthe last. When I was in Cambridge, I wrote to Mr. Ash, asking him to\r\nsend my College account to my father, after having subtracted about L30\r\nfor my furniture. This he has forgotten to do, and my father has paid\r\nthe bill, and I want to have the furniture-money transmitted to my\r\nfather. Perhaps you would be kind enough to speak to Mr. Ash. I have\r\ncost my father so much money, I am quite ashamed of myself.\r\n\r\nI will write once again before sailing, and perhaps you will write to me\r\nbefore then.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. S. Henslow._ Devonport [December 3, 1831].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HENSLOW--It is now late in the evening, and to-night I am going\r\nto sleep on board. On Monday we most certainly sail, so you may guess in\r\nwhat a desperate state of confusion we are all in. If you were to hear\r\nthe various exclamations of the officers, you would suppose we had\r\nscarcely had a week's notice. I am just in the same way taken all\r\n_aback_, and in such a bustle I hardly know what to do. The number of\r\nthings to be done is infinite. I look forward even to sea-sickness with\r\nsomething like satisfaction, anything must be better than this state of\r\nanxiety. I am very much obliged for your last kind and affectionate\r\nletter. I always like advice from you, and no one whom I have the luck\r\nto know is more capable of giving it than yourself. Recollect, when you\r\nwrite, that I am a sort of _protege_ of yours, and that it is your\r\nbounden duty to lecture me.\r\n\r\nI will now give you my direction: it is at first, Rio; but if you will\r\nsend me a letter on the first Tuesday (when the packet sails) in\r\nFebruary, directed to Monte Video, it will give me very great pleasure:\r\nI shall so much enjoy hearing a little Cambridge news. Poor dear old\r\n_Alma Mater_! I am a very worthy son in as far as affection goes. I have\r\nlittle more to write about.... I cannot end this without telling you how\r\ncordially I feel grateful for the kindness you have shown me during my\r\nCambridge life. Much of the pleasure and utility which I may have\r\nderived from it is owing to you. I long for the time when we shall again\r\nmeet, and till then believe me, my dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate and obliged friend,\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[65] \"On Tuesday last Charles Darwin, of Christ's College, was admitted\r\nB.A.\"--_Cambridge Chronicle_, Friday, April 29th, 1831.\r\n\r\n[66] Readers of Calverley (another Christ's man) will remember his\r\ntobacco poem ending \"Hero's to thee, Bacon.\"\r\n\r\n[67] The rooms are on the first floor, on the west side of the middle\r\nstaircase.

W. Darwin's to Professor\r\n     Henslow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the _Beagle_ voyage is briefly described in my father's\r\n_Journal of Researches_, p. 1, as being \"to complete the Survey of\r\nPatagonia and Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826 to\r\n1830; to survey the shores of Chile, Peru, and some islands in the\r\nPacific; and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Beagle_ is described[89] as a well-built little vessel, of 235\r\ntons, rigged as a barque, and carrying six guns. She belonged to the old\r\nclass of ten-gun brigs, which were nicknamed \"coffins,\" from their\r\nliability to go down in severe weather. They were very \"deep-waisted,\"\r\nthat is, their bulwarks were high in proportion to their size, so that a\r\nheavy sea breaking over them might be highly dangerous. Nevertheless,\r\nshe had already lived through five years' work, in the most stormy\r\nregions in the world, under Commanders Stokes and Fitz-Roy without a\r\nserious accident. When re-commissioned in 1831 for her second voyage,\r\nshe was found (as I learned from the late Admiral Sir James Sulivan) to\r\nbe so rotten that she had practically to be rebuilt, and it was this\r\nthat caused the long delay in refitting.\r\n\r\nShe was fitted out for the expedition with all possible care: to quote\r\nmy father's description, written from Devonport, November 17, 1831:\r\n\"Everybody, who can judge, says it is one of the grandest voyages that\r\nhas almost ever been sent out. Everything is on a grand scale.... In\r\nshort, everything is as prosperous as human means can make it.\" The\r\ntwenty-four chronometers and the mahogany fittings seem to have been\r\nespecially admired, and are more than once alluded to.\r\n\r\nOwing to the smallness of the vessel, every one on board was cramped for\r\nroom, and my father's accommodation seems to have been narrow enough.\r\n\r\nYet of this confined space he wrote enthusiastically, September 17,\r\n1831:--\"When I wrote last, I was in great alarm about my cabin. The\r\ncabins were not then marked out, but when I left they were, and mine is\r\na capital one, certainly next best to the Captain's and remarkably\r\nlight. My companion most luckily, I think, will turn out to be the\r\nofficer whom I shall like best. Captain Fitz-Roy says he will take care\r\nthat one corner is so fitted up that I shall be comfortable in it and\r\nshall consider it my home, but that also I shall have the run of his. My\r\ncabin is the drawing one; and in the middle is a large table, on which\r\nwe two sleep in hammocks. But for the first two months there will be no\r\ndrawing to be done, so that it will be quite a luxurious room, and a\r\ngood deal larger than the Captain's cabin.\"\r\n\r\nMy father used to say that it was the absolute necessity of tidiness in\r\nthe cramped space on the _Beagle_ that helped \"to give him his\r\nmethodical habits of working.\" On the _Beagle_, too, he would say, that\r\nhe learned what he considered the golden rule for saving time; _i.e._,\r\ntaking care of the minutes.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his sister (July 1832), he writes contentedly of his\r\nmanner of life at sea:--\"I do not think I have ever given you an account\r\nof how the day passes. We breakfast at eight o'clock. The invariable\r\nmaxim is to throw away all politeness--that is, never to wait for each\r\nother, and bolt off the minute one has done eating, &c. At sea, when the\r\nweather is calm, I work at marine animals, with which the whole ocean\r\nabounds. If there is any sea up I am either sick or contrive to read\r\nsome voyage or travels. At one we dine. You shore-going people are\r\nlamentably mistaken about the manner of living on board. We have never\r\nyet (nor shall we) dined off salt meat. Rice and peas and _calavanses_\r\nare excellent vegetables, and, with good bread, who could want more?\r\nJudge Alderson could not be more temperate, as nothing but water comes\r\non the table. At five we have tea.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Beagle_ consisted of Captain Fitz-Roy, \"Commander and\r\nSurveyor,\" two lieutenants, one of whom (the first lieutenant) was the\r\nlate Captain Wickham, Governor of Queensland; the late Admiral Sir James\r\nSulivan, K.C.B., was the second lieutenant. Besides the master and two\r\nmates, there was an assistant-surveyor, the late Admiral Lort Stokes.\r\nThere were also a surgeon, assistant-surgeon, two midshipmen, master's\r\nmate, a volunteer (1st class), purser, carpenter, clerk, boatswain,\r\neight marines, thirty-four seamen, and six boys.\r\n\r\nThere are not now (1892) many survivors of my father's old ship-mates.\r\nAdmiral Mellersh, and Mr. Philip King, of the Legislative Council of\r\nSydney, are among the number. Admiral Johnson died almost at the same\r\ntime as my father.\r\n\r\nMy father retained to the last a most pleasant recollection of the\r\nvoyage of the _Beagle_, and of the friends he made on board her. To his\r\nchildren their names were familiar, from his many stories of the voyage,\r\nand we caught his feeling of friendship for many who were to us nothing\r\nmore than names.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to know how affectionately his old companions remember\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSir James Sulivan remained, throughout my father's lifetime, one of his\r\nbest and truest friends. He writes:--\"I can confidently express my\r\nbelief that during the five years in the _Beagle_, he was never known to\r\nbe out of temper, or to say one unkind or hasty word _of_ or _to_ any\r\none. You will therefore readily understand how this, combined with the\r\nadmiration of his energy and ability, led to our giving him the name of\r\n'the dear old Philosopher.'\"[90] Admiral Mellersh writes to me:--\"Your\r\nfather is as vividly in my mind's eye as if it was only a week ago that\r\nI was in the _Beagle_ with him; his genial smile and conversation can\r\nnever be forgotten by any who saw them and heard them. I was sent on two\r\nor three occasions away in a boat with him on some of his scientific\r\nexcursions, and always looked forward to these trips with great\r\npleasure, an anticipation that, unlike many others, was always realised.\r\nI think he was the only man I ever knew against whom I never heard a\r\nword said; and as people when shut up in a ship for five years are apt\r\nto get cross with each other, that is saying a good deal.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Stokes, Mr. King, Mr. Usborne, and Mr. Hamond, all speak of\r\ntheir friendship with him in the same warm-hearted way.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy was a strict officer, and made himself thoroughly\r\nrespected both by officers and men. The occasional severity of his\r\nmanner was borne with because every one on board knew that his first\r\nthought was his duty, and that he would sacrifice anything to the real\r\nwelfare of the ship. My father writes, July 1834: \"We all jog on very\r\nwell together, there is no quarrelling on board, which is something to\r\nsay. The Captain keeps all smooth by rowing every one in turn.\"\r\n\r\nMy father speaks of the officers as a fine determined set of men, and\r\nespecially of Wickham, the first lieutenant, as a \"glorious fellow.\" The\r\nlatter being responsible for the smartness and appearance of the ship\r\nstrongly objected to Darwin littering the decks, and spoke of specimens\r\nas \"d----d beastly devilment,\" and used to add, \"If I were skipper, I\r\nwould soon have you and all your d----d mess out of the place.\"\r\n\r\nA sort of halo of sanctity was given to my father by the fact of his\r\ndining in the Captain's cabin, so that the midshipmen used at first to\r\ncall him \"Sir,\" a formality, however, which did not prevent his becoming\r\nfast friends with the younger officers. He wrote about the year 1861 or\r\n1862 to Mr. P. G. King, M.L.C., Sydney, who, as before stated, was a\r\nmidshipman on board the _Beagle_:--\"The remembrance of old days, when we\r\nused to sit and talk on the booms of the _Beagle_, will always, to the\r\nday of my death, make me glad to hear of your happiness and prosperity.\"\r\nMr. King describes the pleasure my father seemed to take \"in pointing\r\nout to me as a youngster the delights of the tropical nights, with their\r\nbalmy breezes eddying out of the sails above us, and the sea lighted up\r\nby the passage of the ship through the never-ending streams of\r\nphosphorescent animalculae.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed that his ill-health in later years was due to his\r\nhaving suffered so much from sea-sickness. This he did not himself\r\nbelieve, but rather ascribed his bad health to the hereditary fault\r\nwhich took shape as gout in some of the past generations. I am not quite\r\nclear as to how much he actually suffered from sea-sickness; my\r\nimpression is distinct that, according to his own memory, he was not\r\nactually ill after the first three weeks, but constantly uncomfortable\r\nwhen the vessel pitched at all heavily. But, judging from his letters,\r\nand from the evidence of some of the officers, it would seem that in\r\nlater years he forgot the extent of the discomfort. Writing June 3,\r\n1836, from the Cape of Good Hope, he says: \"It is a lucky thing for me\r\nthat the voyage is drawing to its close, for I positively suffer more\r\nfrom sea-sickness now than three years ago.\"\r\n\r\n_C. D. to R. W. Darwin._ Bahia, or San Salvador, Brazil. [February 8,\r\n1832.]\r\n\r\n     I find after the first page I have been writing to my sisters.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FATHER--I am writing this on the 8th of February, one day's sail\r\npast St. Jago (Cape de Verd), and intend taking the chance of meeting\r\nwith a homeward-bound vessel somewhere about the equator. The date,\r\nhowever, will tell this whenever the opportunity occurs. I will now\r\nbegin from the day of leaving England, and give a short account of our\r\nprogress. We sailed, as you know, on the 27th of December, and have been\r\nfortunate enough to have had from that time to the present a fair and\r\nmoderate breeze. It afterwards proved that we had escaped a heavy gale\r\nin the Channel, another at Madeira, and another on [the] Coast of\r\nAfrica. But in escaping the gale, we felt its consequence--a heavy sea.\r\nIn the Bay of Biscay there was a long and continuous swell, and the\r\nmisery I endured from sea-sickness is far beyond what I ever guessed at.\r\nI believe you are curious about it. I will give you all my dear-bought\r\nexperience. Nobody who has only been to sea for twenty-four hours has a\r\nright to say that sea-sickness is even uncomfortable. The real misery\r\nonly begins when you are so exhausted that a little exertion makes a\r\nfeeling of faintness come on. I found nothing but lying in my hammock\r\ndid me any good. I must especially except your receipt of raisins, which\r\nis the only food that the stomach will bear.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January we were not many miles from Madeira, but as there\r\nwas a heavy sea running, and the island lay to windward, it was not\r\nthought worth while to beat up to it. It afterwards has turned out it\r\nwas lucky we saved ourselves the trouble. I was much too sick even to\r\nget up to see the distant outline. On the 6th, in the evening, we sailed\r\ninto the harbour of Santa Cruz. I now first felt even moderately well,\r\nand I was picturing to myself all the delights of fresh fruit growing in\r\nbeautiful valleys, and reading Humboldt's description of the island's\r\nglorious views, when perhaps you may nearly guess at our disappointment,\r\nwhen a small pale man informed us we must perform a strict quarantine of\r\ntwelve days. There was a death-like stillness in the ship till the\r\nCaptain cried \"up jib,\" and we left this long wished-for place.\r\n\r\nWe were becalmed for a day between Teneriffe and the Grand Canary, and\r\nhere I first experienced any enjoyment. The view was glorious. The Peak\r\nof Teneriffe was seen amongst the clouds like another world. Our only\r\ndrawback was the extreme wish of visiting this glorious island. From\r\nTeneriffe to St. Jago the voyage was extremely pleasant. I had a net\r\nastern the vessel which caught great numbers of curious animals, and\r\nfully occupied my time in my cabin, and on deck the weather was so\r\ndelightful and clear, that the sky and water together made a picture. On\r\nthe 16th we arrived at Port Praya, the capital of the Cape de Verds, and\r\nthere we remained twenty-three days, viz. till yesterday, the 7th of\r\nFebruary. The time has flown away most delightfully, indeed nothing can\r\nbe pleasanter; exceedingly busy, and that business both a duty and a\r\ngreat delight. I do not believe I have spent one half-hour idly since\r\nleaving Teneriffe. St. Jago has afforded me an exceedingly rich harvest\r\nin several branches of Natural History. I find the descriptions scarcely\r\nworth anything of many of the commoner animals that inhabit the Tropics.\r\nI allude, of course, to those of the lower classes.\r\n\r\nGeologising in a volcanic country is most delightful; besides the\r\ninterest attached to itself, it leads you into most beautiful and\r\nretired spots. Nobody but a person fond of Natural History can imagine\r\nthe pleasure of strolling under cocoa-nuts in a thicket of bananas and\r\ncoffee-plants, and an endless number of wild flowers. And this island,\r\nthat has given me so much instruction and delight, is reckoned the most\r\nuninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage. It\r\ncertainly is generally very barren, but the valleys are more exquisitely\r\nbeautiful, from the very contrast. It is utterly useless to say anything\r\nabout the scenery; it would be as profitable to explain to a blind man\r\ncolours, as to a person who has not been out of Europe, the total\r\ndissimilarity of a tropical view. Whenever I enjoy anything, I always\r\neither look forward to writing it down, either in my log-book (which\r\nincreases in bulk), or in a letter; so you must excuse raptures, and\r\nthose raptures badly expressed. I find my collections are increasing\r\nwonderfully, and from Rio I think I shall be obliged to send a cargo\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAll the endless delays which we experienced at Plymouth have been most\r\nfortunate, as I verily believe no person ever went out better provided\r\nfor collecting and observing in the different branches of Natural\r\nHistory. In a multitude of counsellors I certainly found good. I find to\r\nmy great surprise that a ship is singularly comfortable for all sorts of\r\nwork. Everything is so close at hand, and being cramped makes one so\r\nmethodical, that in the end I have been a gainer. I already have got to\r\nlook at going to sea as a regular quiet place, like going back to home\r\nafter staying away from it. In short, I find a ship a very comfortable\r\nhouse, with everything you want, and if it was not for sea-sickness the\r\nwhole world would be sailors. I do not think there is much danger of\r\nErasmus setting the example, but in case there should be, he may rely\r\nupon it he does not know one-tenth of the sufferings of sea-sickness.\r\n\r\nI like the officers much more than I did at first, especially Wickham,\r\nand young King and Stokes, and indeed all of them. The Captain continues\r\nsteadily very kind, and does everything in his power to assist me. We\r\nsee very little of each other when in harbour, our pursuits lead us in\r\nsuch different tracks. I never in my life met with a man who could\r\nendure nearly so great a share of fatigue. He works incessantly, and\r\nwhen apparently not employed, he is thinking. If he does not kill\r\nhimself, he will during this voyage do a wonderful quantity of work....\r\n\r\n_February 26th._--About 280 miles from Bahia. We have been singularly\r\nunlucky in not meeting with any homeward-bound vessels, but I suppose\r\n[at] Bahia we certainly shall be able to write to England. Since writing\r\nthe first part of [this] letter nothing has occurred except crossing the\r\nEquator, and being shaved. This most disagreeable operation, consists in\r\nhaving your face rubbed with paint and tar, which forms a lather for a\r\nsaw which represents the razor, and then being half drowned in a sail\r\nfilled with salt water. About 50 miles north of the line we touched at\r\nthe rocks of St. Paul; this little speck (about 1/4 of a mile across) in\r\nthe Atlantic has seldom been visited. It is totally barren, but is\r\ncovered by hosts of birds; they were so unused to men that we found we\r\ncould kill plenty with stones and sticks. After remaining some hours on\r\nthe island, we returned on board with the boat loaded with our prey.[91]\r\nFrom this we went to Fernando Noronha, a small island where the\r\n[Brazilians] send their exiles. The landing there was attended with so\r\nmuch difficulty owing [to] a heavy surf that the Captain determined to\r\nsail the next day after arriving. My one day on shore was exceedingly\r\ninteresting, the whole island is one single wood so matted together by\r\ncreepers that it is very difficult to move out of the beaten path. I\r\nfind the Natural History of all these unfrequented spots most\r\nexceedingly interesting, especially the geology. I have written this\r\nmuch in order to save time at Bahia.\r\n\r\nDecidedly the most striking thing in the Tropics is the novelty of the\r\nvegetable forms. Cocoa-nuts could well be imagined from drawings, if you\r\nadd to them a graceful lightness which no European tree partakes of.\r\nBananas and plantains are exactly the same as those in hothouses, the\r\nacacias or tamarinds are striking from the blueness of their foliage;\r\nbut of the glorious orange trees, no description, no drawings, will give\r\nany just idea; instead of the sickly green of our oranges, the native\r\nones exceed the Portugal laurel in the darkness of their tint, and\r\ninfinitely exceed it in beauty of form. Cocoa-nuts, papaws, the\r\nlight-green bananas, and oranges, loaded with fruit, generally surround\r\nthe more luxuriant villages. Whilst viewing such scenes, one feels the\r\nimpossibility that any description should come near the mark, much less\r\nbe over-drawn.\r\n\r\n_March 1st._--Bahia, or San Salvador. I arrived at this place on the\r\n28th of February, and am now writing this letter after having in real\r\nearnest strolled in the forests of the new world. No person could\r\nimagine anything so beautiful as the ancient town of Bahia, it is fairly\r\nembosomed in a luxuriant wood of beautiful trees, and situated on a\r\nsteep bank, and overlooks the calm waters of the great bay of All\r\nSaints. The houses are white and lofty, and, from the windows being\r\nnarrow and long, have a very light and elegant appearance. Convents,\r\nporticos, and public buildings, vary the uniformity of the houses; the\r\nbay is scattered over with large ships; in short, and what can be said\r\nmore, it is one of the finest views in the Brazils. But the exquisite\r\nglorious pleasure of walking amongst such flowers, and such trees,\r\ncannot be comprehended but by those who have experienced it.[92]\r\nAlthough in so low a latitude the locality is not disagreeably hot, but\r\nat present it is very damp, for it is the rainy season. I find the\r\nclimate as yet agrees admirably with me; it makes me long to live\r\nquietly for some time in such a country. If you really want to have [an\r\nidea] of tropical countries, study Humboldt. Skip the scientific parts,\r\nand commence after leaving Teneriffe. My feelings amount to admiration\r\nthe more I read him....\r\n\r\nThis letter will go on the 5th, and I am afraid will be some time before\r\nit reaches you; it must be a warning how in other parts of the world you\r\nmay be a long time without hearing. A year might by accident thus pass.\r\nAbout the 12th we start for Rio, but we remain some time on the way in\r\nsounding the Albrolhos shoals....\r\n\r\nWe have beat all the ships in manoeuvring, so much so that the\r\ncommanding officer says we need not follow his example; because we do\r\neverything better than his great ship. I begin to take great interest in\r\nnaval points, more especially now, as I find they all say we are the No.\r\n1 in South America. I suppose the Captain is a most excellent officer.\r\nIt was quite glorious to-day how we beat the _Samarang_ in furling\r\nsails. It is quite a new thing for a \"sounding ship\" to beat a regular\r\nman-of-war; and yet the _Beagle_ is not at all a particular ship.\r\nErasmus will clearly perceive it when he hears that in the night I have\r\nactually sat down in the sacred precincts of the quarter deck. You must\r\nexcuse these queer letters, and recollect they are generally written in\r\nthe evening after my day's work. I take more pains over my log-book, so\r\nthat eventually you will have a good account of all the places I visit.\r\nHitherto the voyage has answered _admirably_ to me, and yet I am now\r\nmore fully aware of your wisdom in throwing cold water on the whole\r\nscheme; the chances are so numerous of [its] turning out quite the\r\nreverse; to such an extent do I feel this, that if my advice was asked\r\nby any person on a similar occasion, I should be very cautious in\r\nencouraging him. I have not time to write to anybody else, so send to\r\nMaer to let them know, that in the midst of the glorious tropical\r\nscenery, I do not forget how instrumental they were in placing me there.\r\nI will not rapturise again, but I give myself great credit in not being\r\ncrazy out of pure delight.\r\n\r\nGive my love to every soul at home, and to the Owens.\r\n\r\nI think one's affections, like other good things, flourish and increase\r\nin these tropical regions.\r\n\r\nThe conviction that I am walking in the New World is even yet\r\nmarvellous in my own eyes, and I daresay it is little less so to you,\r\nthe receiving a letter from a son of yours in such a quarter.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear father, your most affectionate son.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Beagle_ letters give ample proof of his strong love of home, and\r\nall connected with it, from his father down to Nancy, his old nurse, to\r\nwhom he sometimes sends his love.\r\n\r\nHis delight in home-letters is shown in such passages as:--\"But if you\r\nknew the glowing, unspeakable delight, which I felt at being certain\r\nthat my father and all of you were well, only four months ago, you would\r\nnot grudge the labour lost in keeping up the regular series of letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would be surprised to know how entirely the pleasure in arriving at\r\na new place depends on letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw the other day a vessel sail for England; it was quite dangerous\r\nto know how easily I might turn deserter. As for an English lady, I have\r\nalmost forgotten what she is--something very angelic and good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just received a bundle more letters. I do not know how to thank\r\nyou all sufficiently. One from Catherine, February 8th, another from\r\nSusan, March 3rd, together with notes from Caroline and from my father;\r\ngive my best love to my father. I almost cried for pleasure at receiving\r\nit; it was very kind thinking of writing to me. My letters are both few,\r\nshort, and stupid in return for all yours; but I always ease my\r\nconscience, by considering the Journal as a long letter.\"\r\n\r\nOr again--his longing to return in words like these:--\"It is too\r\ndelightful to think that I shall see the leaves fall and hear the robin\r\nsing next autumn at Shrewsbury. My feelings are those of a school-boy to\r\nthe smallest point; I doubt whether ever boy longed for his holidays as\r\nmuch as I do to see you all again. I am at present, although nearly half\r\nthe world is between me and home, beginning to arrange what I shall do,\r\nwhere I shall go during the first week.\"\r\n\r\n\"No schoolboys ever sung the half-sentimental and half-jovial strain of\r\n'dulce domum' with more fervour than we all feel inclined to do. But the\r\nwhole subject of 'dulce domum,' and the delight of seeing one's friends,\r\nis most dangerous, it must infallibly make one very prosy or very\r\nboisterous. Oh, the degree to which I long to be once again living\r\nquietly with not one single novel object near me! No one can imagine it\r\ntill he has been whirled round the world during five long years in a\r\nten-gun brig.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts may serve to give an idea of the impressions now\r\ncrowding on him, as well as of the vigorous delight with which he\r\nplunged into scientific work.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 18, 1832, to Henslow:--\r\n\r\n\"Here [Rio], I first saw a tropical forest in all its sublime\r\ngrandeur--nothing but the reality can give any idea how wonderful, how\r\nmagnificent the scene is. If I was to specify any one thing I should\r\ngive the pre-eminence to the host of parasitical plants. Your engraving\r\nis exactly true, but under-rates rather than exaggerates the luxuriance.\r\nI never experienced such intense delight. I formerly admired Humboldt, I\r\nnow almost adore him; he alone gives any notion of the feelings which\r\nare raised in the mind on first entering the Tropics. I am now\r\ncollecting fresh-water and land animals; if what was told me in London\r\nis true, viz., that there are no small insects in the collections from\r\nthe Tropics, I tell Entomologists to look out and have their pens ready\r\nfor describing. I have taken as minute (if not more so) as in England,\r\nHydropori, Hygroti, Hydrobii, Pselaphi, Staphylini, Curculio, &c. &c. It\r\nis exceedingly interesting observing the difference of genera and\r\nspecies from those which I know; it is however much less than I had\r\nexpected. I am at present red-hot with spiders; they are very\r\ninteresting, and if I am not mistaken I have already taken some new\r\ngenera. I shall have a large box to send very soon to Cambridge, and\r\nwith that I will mention some more natural history particulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"One great source of perplexity to me is an utter ignorance whether I\r\nnote the right facts, and whether they are of sufficient importance to\r\ninterest others. In the one thing collecting I cannot go wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Geology carries the day: it is like the pleasure of gambling.\r\nSpeculating, on first arriving, what the rocks may be, I often mentally\r\ncry out 3 to 1 tertiary against primitive; but the latter have hitherto\r\nwon all the bets. So much for the grand end of my voyage: in other\r\nrespects things are equally flourishing. My life, when at sea, is so\r\nquiet, that to a person who can employ himself, nothing can be\r\npleasanter; the beauty of the sky and brilliancy of the ocean together\r\nmake a picture. But when on shore, and wandering in the sublime forests,\r\nsurrounded by views more gorgeous than even Claude ever imagined, I\r\nenjoy a delight which none but those who have experienced it can\r\nunderstand. At our ancient snug breakfasts, at Cambridge, I little\r\nthought that the wide Atlantic would ever separate us; but it is a rare\r\nprivilege that with the body, the feelings and memory are not divided.\r\nOn the contrary, the pleasantest scenes in my life, many of which have\r\nbeen in Cambridge, rise from the contrast of the present, the more\r\nvividly in my imagination. Do you think any diamond beetle will ever\r\ngive me so much pleasure as our old friend _crux-major_?... It is one of\r\nmy most constant amusements to draw pictures of the past; and in them I\r\noften see you and poor little Fan. Oh, Lord, and then old Dash poor\r\nthing! Do you recollect how you all tormented me about his beautiful\r\ntail?\"--[From a letter to Fox.]\r\n\r\nTo his sister, June 1833:--\r\n\r\n\"I am quite delighted to find the hide of the Megatherium has given you\r\nall some little interest in my employments. These fragments are not,\r\nhowever, by any means the most valuable of the geological relics. I\r\ntrust and believe that the time spent in this voyage, if thrown away for\r\nall other respects, will produce its full worth in Natural History; and\r\nit appears to me the doing what _little_ we can to increase the general\r\nstock of knowledge is as respectable an object of life as one can in any\r\nlikelihood pursue. It is more the result of such reflections (as I have\r\nalready said) than much immediate pleasure which now makes me continue\r\nthe voyage, together with the glorious prospect of the future, when\r\npassing the Straits of Magellan, we have in truth the world before us.\"\r\n\r\nTo Fox, July 1835:--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear you have some thoughts of beginning Geology. I hope\r\nyou will; there is so much larger a field for thought than in the other\r\nbranches of Natural History. I am become a zealous disciple of Mr.\r\nLyell's views, as known in his admirable book. Geologising in South\r\nAmerica, I am tempted to carry parts to a greater extent even than he\r\ndoes. Geology is a capital science to begin, as it requires nothing but\r\na little reading, thinking, and hammering. I have a considerable body of\r\nnotes together; but it is a constant subject of perplexity to me,\r\nwhether they are of sufficient value for all the time I have spent about\r\nthem, or whether animals would not have been of more certain value.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following letter to his sister Susan he gives an\r\naccount,--adapted to the non-geological mind,--of his South American\r\nwork:--\r\n\r\n\r\nValparaiso, April 23, 1835.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SUSAN--I received, a few days since, your letter of November;\r\nthe three letters which I before mentioned are yet missing, but I do not\r\ndoubt they will come to life. I returned a week ago from my excursion\r\nacross the Andes to Mendoza. Since leaving England I have never made so\r\nsuccessful a journey; it has, however, been very expensive. I am sure my\r\nfather would not regret it, if he could know how deeply I have enjoyed\r\nit: it was something more than enjoyment; I cannot express the delight\r\nwhich I felt at such a famous winding-up of all my geology in South\r\nAmerica. I literally could hardly sleep at nights for thinking over my\r\nday's work. The scenery was so new, and so majestic; everything at an\r\nelevation of 12,000 feet bears so different an aspect from that in a\r\nlower country. I have seen many views more beautiful, but none with so\r\nstrongly marked a character. To a geologist, also, there are such\r\nmanifest proofs of excessive violence; the strata of the highest\r\npinnacles are tossed about like the crust of a broken pie.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose any of you can be much interested in geological\r\ndetails, but I will just mention my principal results:--Besides\r\nunderstanding to a certain extent the description and manner of the\r\nforce which has elevated this great line of mountains, I can clearly\r\ndemonstrate that one part of the double line is of an age long posterior\r\nto the other. In the more ancient line, which is the true chain of the\r\nAndes, I can describe the sort and order of the rocks which compose it.\r\nThese are chiefly remarkable by containing a bed of gypsum nearly 2000\r\nfeet thick--a quantity of this substance I should think unparalleled in\r\nthe world. What is of much greater consequence, I have procured fossil\r\nshells (from an elevation of 12,000 feet). I think an examination of\r\nthese will give an approximate age to these mountains, as compared to\r\nthe strata of Europe. In the other line of the Cordilleras there is a\r\nstrong presumption (in my own mind, conviction) that the enormous mass\r\nof mountains, the peaks of which rise to 13,000 and 14,000 feet, are so\r\nvery modern as to be contemporaneous with the plains of Patagonia (or\r\nabout with the _upper_ strata of the Isle of Wight). If this result\r\nshall be considered as proved,[93] it is a very important fact in the\r\ntheory of the formation of the world; because, if such wonderful changes\r\nhave taken place so recently in the crust of the globe, there can be no\r\nreason for supposing former epochs of excessive violence....\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother feature in his letters is the surprise and delight with which he\r\nhears of his collections and observations being of some use. It seems\r\nonly to have gradually occurred to him that he would ever be more than a\r\ncollector of specimens and facts, of which the great men were to make\r\nuse. And even as to the value of his collections he seems to have had\r\nmuch doubt, for he wrote to Henslow in 1834: \"I really began to think\r\nthat my collections were so poor that you were puzzled what to say; the\r\ncase is now quite on the opposite tack, for you are guilty of exciting\r\nall my vain feelings to a most comfortable pitch; if hard work will\r\natone for these thoughts, I vow it shall not be spared.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, to his sister Susan in August, 1836:--\r\n\r\n\"Both your letters were full of good news; especially the expressions\r\nwhich you tell me Professor Sedgwick[94] used about my collections. I\r\nconfess they are deeply gratifying--I trust one part at least will turn\r\nout true, and that I shall act as I now think--as a man who dares to\r\nwaste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life. Professor\r\nSedgwick mentioning my name at all gives me hopes that he will assist me\r\nwith his advice, of which, in my geological questions, I stand much in\r\nneed.\"\r\n\r\nOccasional allusions to slavery show us that his feeling on this subject\r\nwas at this time as strong as in later life[95]:--\r\n\r\n\"The Captain does everything in his power to assist me, and we get on\r\nvery well, but I thank my better fortune he has not made me a renegade\r\nto Whig principles. I would not be a Tory, if it was merely on account\r\nof their cold hearts about that scandal to Christian nations--Slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have watched how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections,\r\nhas been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she\r\nis the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told\r\nbefore leaving England that after living in slave countries all my\r\nopinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming\r\na much higher estimate of the negro character. It is impossible to see a\r\nnegro and not feel kindly towards him; such cheerful, open, honest\r\nexpressions and such fine muscular bodies. I never saw any of the\r\ndiminutive Portuguese, with their murderous countenances, without almost\r\nwishing for Brazil to follow the example of Hayti; and, considering the\r\nenormous healthy-looking black population, it will be wonderful if, at\r\nsome future day, it does not take place. There is at Rio a man (I know\r\nnot his title) who has a large salary to prevent (I believe) the landing\r\nof slaves; he lives at Botofogo, and yet that was the bay where, during\r\nmy residence, the greater number of smuggled slaves were landed. Some of\r\nthe Anti-Slavery people ought to question about his office; it was the\r\nsubject of conversation at Rio amongst the lower English....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. S. Henslow._ Sydney [January, 1836].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HENSLOW--This is the last opportunity of communicating with you\r\nbefore that joyful day when I shall reach Cambridge. I have very little\r\nto say: but I must write if it is only to express my joy that the last\r\nyear is concluded, and that the present one, in which the _Beagle_ will\r\nreturn, is gliding onward. We have all been disappointed here in not\r\nfinding even a single letter; we are, indeed, rather before our expected\r\ntime, otherwise I dare say, I should have seen your handwriting. I must\r\nfeed upon the future, and it is beyond bounds delightful to feel the\r\ncertainty that within eight months I shall be residing once again most\r\nquietly in Cambridge. Certainly, I never was intended for a traveller;\r\nmy thoughts are always rambling over past or future scenes; I cannot\r\nenjoy the present happiness for anticipating the future, which is about\r\nas foolish as the dog who dropped the real bone for its shadow....\r\n\r\nI must return to my old resource and think of the future, but that I may\r\nnot become more prosy, I will say farewell till the day arrives, when I\r\nshall see my Master in Natural History, and can tell him how grateful I\r\nfeel for his kindness and friendship.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Henslow, ever yours most faithfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. S. Henslow._ Shrewsbury [October, 6 1836].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HENSLOW--I am sure you will congratulate me on the delight of\r\nonce again being home. The _Beagle_ arrived at Falmouth on Sunday\r\nevening, and I reached Shrewsbury yesterday morning. I am exceedingly\r\nanxious to see you, and as it will be necessary in four or five days to\r\nreturn to London to get my goods and chattels out of the _Beagle_, it\r\nappears to me my best plan to pass through Cambridge. I want your advice\r\non many points; indeed I am in the clouds, and neither know what to do\r\nor where to go. My chief puzzle is about the geological specimens--who\r\nwill have the charity to help me in describing their mineralogical\r\nnature? Will you be kind enough to write to me one line by _return of\r\npost_, saying whether you are now at Cambridge? I am doubtful till I\r\nhear from Captain Fitz-Roy whether I shall not be obliged to start\r\nbefore the answer can arrive, but pray try the chance. My dear Henslow,\r\nI do long to see you; you have been the kindest friend to me that ever\r\nman possessed. I can write no more, for I am giddy with joy and\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nFarewell for the present,\r\nYours most truly obliged.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his return and settlement in London, he began to realise the value\r\nof what he had done, and wrote to Captain Fitz-Roy--\"However others may\r\nlook back to the _Beagle's_ voyage, now that the small disagreeable\r\nparts are well-nigh forgotten, I think it far the _most fortunate\r\ncircumstance in my life_ that the chance afforded by your offer of\r\ntaking a Naturalist fell on me. I often have the most vivid and\r\ndelightful pictures of what I saw on board the _Beagle_[96] pass before\r\nmy eyes. These recollections, and what I learnt on Natural History, I\r\nwould not exchange for twice ten thousand a year.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] _Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle_, vol. i. introduction xii.\r\nThe illustration at the head of the chapter is from vol. ii. of the same\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[90] His other nickname was \"The Flycatcher.\" I have heard my father\r\ntell how he overheard the boatswain of the _Beagle_ showing another\r\nboatswain over the ship, and pointing out the officers: \"That's our\r\nfirst lieutenant; that's our doctor; that's our flycatcher.\"\r\n\r\n[91] \"There was such a scene here. Wickham (1st Lieutenant) and I were\r\nthe only two who landed with guns and geological hammers, &c. The birds\r\nby myriads were too close to shoot; we then tried stones, but at last,\r\n_proh pudor!_ my geological hammer was the instrument of death. We soon\r\nloaded the boat with birds and eggs. Whilst we were so engaged, the men\r\nin the boat were fairly fighting with the sharks for such magnificent\r\nfish as you could not see in the London market. Our boat would have made\r\na fine subject for Snyders, such a medley of game it contained.\"--From a\r\nletter to Herbert.\r\n\r\n[92] \"My mind has been, since leaving England, in a perfect hurricane of\r\ndelight and astonishment.\"--_C. D. to Fox_, May 1832, from Botofogo Bay.\r\n\r\n[93] The importance of these results has been fully recognized by\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\n[94] Sedgwick wrote (November 7, 1835) to Dr. Butler, the head master of\r\nShrewsbury School:--\"He is doing admirable work in South America, and\r\nhas already sent home a collection above all price. It was the best\r\nthing in the world for him that he went out on the voyage of discovery.\r\nThere was some risk of his turning out an idle man, but his character\r\nwill now be fixed, and if God spares his life he will have a great name\r\namong the naturalists of Europe....\"--I am indebted to my friend Mr. J.\r\nW. Clark, the biographer of Sedgwick, for the above extract.\r\n\r\n[95] Compare the following passage from a letter (Aug. 25, 1845)\r\naddressed to Lyell, who had touched on slavery in his _Travels in North\r\nAmerica._ \"I was delighted with your letter in which you touch on\r\nSlavery; I wish the same feelings had been apparent in your published\r\ndiscussion. But I will not write on this subject, I should perhaps annoy\r\nyou, and most certainly myself. I have exhaled myself with a paragraph\r\nor two in my Journal on the sin of Brazilian slavery; you perhaps will\r\nthink that it is in answer to you; but such is not the case. I have\r\nremarked on nothing which I did not hear on the coast of South America.\r\nMy few sentences, however, are merely an explosion of feeling. How could\r\nyou relate so placidly that atrocious sentiment about separating\r\nchildren from their parents; and in the next page speak of being\r\ndistressed at the whites not having prospered; I assure you the contrast\r\nmade me exclaim out. But I have broken my intention, and so no more on\r\nthis odious deadly subject.\" It is fair to add that the \"atrocious\r\nsentiments\" were not Lyell's but those of a planter.\r\n\r\n[96] According to the _Japan Weekly Mail_, as quoted in _Nature_, March\r\n8, 1888, the _Beagle_ is in use as a training ship at Yokosuka, in\r\nJapan. Part of the old ship is, I am glad to think, in my possession, in\r\nthe form of a box (which I owe to the kindness of Admiral Mellersh) made\r\nout of her main cross-tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLONDON AND CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n1836-1842.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period illustrated in the present chapter includes the years between\r\nDarwin's return from the voyage of the _Beagle_ and his settling at\r\nDown. It is marked by the gradual appearance of that weakness of health\r\nwhich ultimately forced him to leave London and take up his abode for\r\nthe rest of his life in a quiet country house.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence of any intention of entering a profession after his\r\nreturn from the voyage, and early in 1840 he wrote to Fitz-Roy: \"I have\r\nnothing to wish for, excepting stronger health to go on with the\r\nsubjects to which I have joyfully determined to devote my life.\"\r\n\r\nThese two conditions--permanent ill-health and a passionate love of\r\nscientific work for its own sake--determined thus early in his career,\r\nthe character of his whole future life. They impelled him to lead a\r\nretired life of constant labour, carried on to the utmost limits of his\r\nphysical power, a life which signally falsified his melancholy\r\nprophecy:--\"It has been a bitter mortification for me to digest the\r\nconclusion that the 'race is for the strong,' and that I shall probably\r\ndo little more, but be content to admire the strides others make in\r\nscience.\"\r\n\r\nThe end of the last chapter saw my father safely arrived at Shrewsbury\r\non October 4, 1836, \"after an absence of five years and two days.\" He\r\nwrote to Fox: \"You cannot imagine how gloriously delightful my first\r\nvisit was at home; it was worth the banishment.\" But it was a pleasure\r\nthat he could not long enjoy, for in the last days of October he was at\r\nGreenwich unpacking specimens from the _Beagle_. As to the destination\r\nof the collections he writes, somewhat despondingly, to Henslow:--\r\n\r\n\"I have not made much progress with the great men. I find, as you told\r\nme, that they are all overwhelmed with their own business. Mr. Lyell has\r\nentered, in the _most_ good-natured manner, and almost without being\r\nasked, into all my plans. He tells me, however, the same story, that I\r\nmust do all myself. Mr. Owen seems anxious to dissect some of the\r\nanimals in spirits, and, besides these two, I have scarcely met any one\r\nwho seems to wish to possess any of my specimens. I must except Dr.\r\nGrant, who is willing to examine some of the corallines. I see it is\r\nquite unreasonable to hope for a minute that any man will undertake the\r\nexamination of a whole order. It is clear the collectors so much\r\noutnumber the real naturalists that the latter have no time to spare.\r\n\r\n\"I do not even find that the Collections care for receiving the unnamed\r\nspecimens. The Zoological Museum[97] is nearly full, and upwards of a\r\nthousand specimens remain unmounted. I dare say the British Museum would\r\nreceive them, but I cannot feel, from all I hear, any great respect even\r\nfor the present state of that establishment. Your plan will be not only\r\nthe best, but the only one, namely, to come down to Cambridge, arrange\r\nand group together the different families, and then wait till people,\r\nwho are already working in different branches, may want specimens....\r\n\r\n\"I have forgotten to mention Mr. Lonsdale,[98] who gave me a most\r\ncordial reception, and with whom I had much most interesting\r\nconversation. If I was not much more inclined for geology than the other\r\nbranches of Natural History, I am sure Mr. Lyell's and Lonsdale's\r\nkindness ought to fix me. You cannot conceive anything more thoroughly\r\ngood-natured than the heart-and-soul manner in which he put himself in\r\nmy place and thought what would be best to do.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later he writes more cheerfully: \"I became acquainted with\r\nMr. Bell,[99] who, to my surprise, expressed a good deal of interest\r\nabout my crustacea and reptiles, and seems willing to work at them. I\r\nalso heard that Mr. Broderip would be glad to look over the South\r\nAmerican shells, so that things flourish well with me.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on November 6:--\r\n\r\n\"All my affairs, indeed, are most prosperous; I find there are plenty\r\nwho will undertake the description of whole tribes of animals, of which\r\nI know nothing.\"\r\n\r\nAs to his Geological Collection he was soon able to write: \"I [have]\r\ndisposed of the most important part [of] my collections, by giving all\r\nthe fossil bones to the College of Surgeons, casts of them will be\r\ndistributed, and descriptions published. They are very curious and\r\nvaluable; one head belonged to some gnawing animal, but of the size of a\r\nHippopotamus! Another to an ant-eater of the size of a horse!\"\r\n\r\nMy father's specimens included (besides the above-mentioned Toxodon and\r\nScelidotherium) the remains of Mylodon, Glossotherium, another gigantic\r\nanimal allied to the ant-eater, and Macrauchenia. His discovery of these\r\nremains is a matter of interest in itself, but it has a special\r\nimportance as a point in his own life, his speculation on the extinction\r\nof these extraordinary creatures[100] and on their relationship to\r\nliving forms having formed one of the chief starting-points of his views\r\non the origin of species. This is shown in the following extract from\r\nhis Pocket Book for this year (1837): \"In July opened first note-book on\r\nTransmutation of Species. Had been greatly struck from about the month\r\nof previous March on character of South American fossils, and species on\r\nGalapagos Archipelago. These facts (especially latter), origin of all my\r\nviews.\"\r\n\r\nHis affairs being thus so far prosperously managed he was able to put\r\ninto execution his plan of living at Cambridge, where he settled on\r\nDecember 10th, 1836.\r\n\r\n\"Cambridge,\" he writes, \"yet continues a very pleasant, but not half so\r\nmerry a place as before. To walk through the courts of Christ's College,\r\nand not know an inhabitant of a single room, gave one a feeling half\r\nmelancholy. The only evil I found in Cambridge was its being too\r\npleasant: there was some agreeable party or another every evening, and\r\none cannot say one is engaged with so much impunity there as in this\r\ngreat city.\"[101]\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1837 he left Cambridge for London, and a week\r\nlater he was settled in lodgings at 36 Great Marlborough Street; and\r\nexcept for a \"short visit to Shrewsbury\" in June, he worked on till\r\nSeptember, being almost entirely employed on his _Journal_, of which he\r\nwrote (March):--\r\n\r\n\"In your last letter you urge me to get ready _the_ book. I am now hard\r\nat work and give up everything else for it. Our plan is as follows:\r\nCapt. Fitz-Roy writes two volumes out of the materials collected during\r\nthe last voyage under Capt. King to Tierra del Fuego, and during our\r\ncircumnavigation. I am to have the third volume, in which I intend\r\ngiving a kind of journal of a naturalist, not following, however, always\r\nthe order of time, but rather the order of position.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to Fox (July) gives an account of the progress of his work:--\r\n\r\n\"I gave myself a holiday and a visit to Shrewsbury [in June], as I had\r\nfinished my Journal. I shall now be very busy in filling up gaps and\r\ngetting it quite ready for the press by the first of August. I shall\r\nalways feel respect for every one who has written a book, let it be what\r\nit may, for I had no idea of the trouble which trying to write common\r\nEnglish could cost one. And, alas, there yet remains the worst part of\r\nall, correcting the press. As soon as ever that is done I must put my\r\nshoulder to the wheel and commence at the Geology. I have read some\r\nshort papers to the Geological Society, and they were favourably\r\nreceived by the great guns, and this gives me much confidence, and I\r\nhope not a very great deal of vanity, though I confess I feel too often\r\nlike a peacock admiring his tail. I never expected that my Geology would\r\never have been worth the consideration of such men as Lyell, who has\r\nbeen to me, since my return, a most active friend. My life is a very\r\nbusy one at present, and I hope may ever remain so; though Heaven knows\r\nthere are many serious drawbacks to such a life, and chief amongst them\r\nis the little time it allows one for seeing one's natural friends. For\r\nthe last three years, I have been longing and longing to be living at\r\nShrewsbury, and after all now in the course of several months, I see my\r\ngood dear people at Shrewsbury for a week. Susan and Catherine have,\r\nhowever, been staying with my brother here for some weeks, but they had\r\nreturned home before my visit.\"\r\n\r\nIn August he writes to Henslow to announce the success of the scheme for\r\nthe publication of the _Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle_, through\r\nthe promise of a grant of L1000 from the Treasury: \"I had an interview\r\nwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer.[102] He appointed to see me this\r\nmorning, and I had a long conversation with him, Mr. Peacock being\r\npresent. Nothing could be more thoroughly obliging and kind than his\r\nwhole manner. He made no sort of restriction, but only told me to make\r\nthe most of the money, which of course I am right willing to do.\r\n\r\n\"I expected rather an awful interview, but I never found anything less\r\nso in my life. It will be my fault if I do not make a good work; but I\r\nsometimes take an awful fright that I have not materials enough. It will\r\nbe excessively satisfactory at the end of some two years to find all\r\nmaterials made the most they were capable of.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the autumn he wrote to Henslow: \"I have not been very well of\r\nlate, with an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart, and my doctors\r\nurge me _strongly_ to knock off all work, and go and live in the country\r\nfor a few weeks.\" He accordingly took a holiday of about a month at\r\nShrewsbury and Maer, and paid Fox a visit in the Isle of Wight. It was,\r\nI believe, during this visit, at Mr. Wedgwood's house at Maer, that he\r\nmade his first observations on the work done by earthworms, and late in\r\nthe autumn he read a paper on the subject at the Geological Society.\r\n\r\nHere he was already beginning to make his mark. Lyell wrote to Sedgwick\r\n(April 21, 1837):--\r\n\r\n\"Darwin is a glorious addition to any society of geologists, and is\r\nworking hard and making way both in his book and in our discussions. I\r\nreally never saw that bore Dr. Mitchell so successfully silenced, or\r\nsuch a bucket of cold water so dexterously poured down his back, as when\r\nDarwin answered some impertinent and irrelevant questions about South\r\nAmerica. We escaped fifteen minutes of Dr. M.'s vulgar harangue in\r\nconsequence....\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year (1838), he was, much against his will,\r\nelected Secretary of the Geological Society, an office he held for three\r\nyears. A chief motive for his hesitation in accepting the post was the\r\ncondition of his health, the doctors having urged \"me to give up\r\nentirely all writing and even correcting press for some weeks. Of late\r\nanything which flurries me completely knocks me up afterwards, and\r\nbrings on a violent palpitation of the heart.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1838 he started on his expedition to Glen Roy, where he\r\nspent \"eight good days\" over the Parallel Roads. His Essay on this\r\nsubject was written out during the same summer, and published by the\r\nRoyal Society.[103] He wrote in his Pocket Book: \"September 6 (1838).\r\nFinished the paper on 'Glen Roy,' one of the most difficult and\r\ninstructive tasks I was ever engaged on.\" It will be remembered that in\r\nhis _Autobiography_ he speaks of this paper as a failure, of which he\r\nwas ashamed.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Lyell._ [August 9th, 1838.]\r\n\r\n36 Great Marlborough Street.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL--I did not write to you at Norwich, for I thought I should\r\nhave more to say, if I waited a few more days. Very many thanks for the\r\npresent of your _Elements_, which I received (and I believe the _very\r\nfirst_ copy distributed) together with your note. I have read it through\r\nevery word, and am full of admiration of it, and, as I now see no\r\ngeologist, I must talk to you about it. There is no pleasure in reading\r\na book if one cannot have a good talk over it; I repeat, I am full of\r\nadmiration of it, it is as clear as daylight, in fact I felt in many\r\nparts some mortification at thinking how geologists have laboured and\r\nstruggled at proving what seems, as you have put it, so evidently\r\nprobable. I read with much interest your sketch of the secondary\r\ndeposits; you have contrived to make it quite \"juicy,\" as we used to say\r\nas children of a good story. There was also much new to me, and I have\r\nto copy out some fifty notes and references. It must do good, the\r\nheretics against common-sense must yield.... By the way, do you\r\nrecollect my telling you how much I disliked the manner X. referred to\r\nhis other works, as much as to say, \"You must, ought, and shall buy\r\neverything I have written.\" To my mind, you have somehow quite avoided\r\nthis; your references only seem to say, \"I can't tell you all in this\r\nwork, else I would, so you must go to the _Principles_; and many a one,\r\nI trust, you will send there, and make them, like me, adorers of the\r\ngood science of rock-breaking.\"[105] You will see I am in a fit of\r\nenthusiasm, and good cause I have to be, when I find you have made such\r\ninfinitely more use of my Journal than I could have anticipated. I will\r\nsay no more about the book, for it is all praise. I must, however,\r\nadmire the elaborate honesty with which you quote the words of all\r\nliving and dead geologists.\r\n\r\nMy Scotch expedition answered brilliantly; my trip in the steam-packet\r\nwas absolutely pleasant, and I enjoyed the spectacle, wretch that I am,\r\nof two ladies, and some small children quite sea-sick, I being well.\r\nMoreover, on my return from Glasgow to Liverpool, I triumphed in a\r\nsimilar manner over some full-grown men. I stayed one whole day in\r\nEdinburgh, or more truly on Salisbury Craigs; I want to hear some day\r\nwhat you think about that classical ground,--the structure was to me new\r\nand rather curious,--that is, if I understand it right. I crossed from\r\nEdinburgh in gigs and carts (and carts without springs, as I never shall\r\nforget) to Loch Leven. I was disappointed in the scenery, and reached\r\nGlen Roy on Saturday evening, one week after leaving Marlborough Street.\r\nHere I enjoyed five [?] days of the most beautiful weather with gorgeous\r\nsunsets, and all nature looking as happy as I felt. I wandered over the\r\nmountains in all directions, and examined that most extraordinary\r\ndistrict. I think, without any exceptions, not even the first volcanic\r\nisland, the first elevated beach, or the passage of the Cordillera, was\r\nso interesting to me as this week. It is far the most remarkable area I\r\never examined. I have fully convinced myself (after some doubting at\r\nfirst) that the shelves are sea-beaches, although I could not find a\r\ntrace of a shell; and I think I can explain away most, if not all, the\r\ndifficulties. I found a piece of a road in another valley, not hitherto\r\nobserved, which is important; and I have some curious facts about\r\nerratic blocks, one of which was perched up on a peak 2200 feet above\r\nthe sea. I am now employed in writing a paper on the subject, which I\r\nfind very amusing work, excepting that I cannot anyhow condense it into\r\nreasonable limits. At some future day I hope to talk over some of the\r\nconclusions with you, which the examination of Glen Roy has led me to.\r\nNow I have had my talk out, I am much easier, for I can assure you Glen\r\nRoy has astonished me.\r\n\r\nI am living very quietly, and therefore pleasantly, and am crawling on\r\nslowly but steadily with my work. I have come to one conclusion, which\r\nyou will think proves me to be a very sensible man, namely, that\r\nwhatever you say proves right; and as a proof of this, I am coming into\r\nyour way of only working about two hours at a spell; I then go out and\r\ndo my business in the streets, return and set to work again, and thus\r\nmake two separate days out of one. The new plan answers capitally; after\r\nthe second half day is finished I go and dine at the Athenaeum like a\r\ngentleman, or rather like a lord, for I am sure the first evening I sat\r\nin that great drawing-room, all on a sofa by myself, I felt just like a\r\nduke. I am full of admiration at the Athenaeum, one meets so many people\r\nthere that one likes to see....\r\n\r\nI have heard from more than one quarter that quarrelling is expected at\r\nNewcastle[106]; I am sorry to hear it. I met old ---- this evening at\r\nthe Athenaeum, and he muttered something about writing to you or some one\r\non the subject; I am however all in the dark. I suppose, however, I\r\nshall be illuminated, for I am going to dine with him in a few days, as\r\nmy inventive powers failed in making any excuse. A friend of mine dined\r\nwith him the other day, a party of four, and they finished ten bottles\r\nof wine--a pleasant prospect for me; but I am determined not even to\r\ntaste his wine, partly for the fun of seeing his infinite disgust and\r\nsurprise....\r\n\r\nI pity you the infliction of this most unmerciful letter. Pray remember\r\nme most kindly to Mrs. Lyell when you arrive at Kinnordy. Tell Mrs.\r\nLyell to read the second series of 'Mr. Slick of Slickville's\r\nSayings.'... He almost beats 'Samivel,' that prince of heroes. Good\r\nnight, my dear Lyell; you will think I have been drinking some strong\r\ndrink to write so much nonsense, but I did not even taste Minerva's\r\nsmall beer to-day....\r\n\r\n\r\nA record of what he wrote during the year 1838 would not give a true\r\nindex of the most important work that was in progress--the laying of the\r\nfoundation-stones of what was to be the achievement of his life. This is\r\nshown in the following passages from a letter to Lyell (September), and\r\nfrom a letter to Fox, written in June:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish with all my heart that my Geological book was out. I have every\r\nmotive to work hard, and will, following your steps, work just that\r\ndegree of hardness to keep well. I should like my volume to be out\r\nbefore your new edition of the _Principles_ appears. Besides the Coral\r\ntheory, the volcanic chapters will, I think, contain some new facts. I\r\nhave lately been sadly tempted to be idle--that is, as far as pure\r\ngeology is concerned--by the delightful number of new views which have\r\nbeen coming in thickly and steadily--on the classification and\r\naffinities and instincts of animals--bearing on the question of species.\r\nNote-book after note-book has been filled with facts which begin to\r\ngroup themselves _clearly_ under sub-laws.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to hear you are such a good man as not to have forgotten\r\nmy questions about the crossing of animals. It is my prime hobby, and I\r\nreally think some day I shall be able to do something in that most\r\nintricate subject, species and varieties.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1839 (Jan. 29) my father was married to his cousin,\r\nEmma Wedgwood.[107] The house in which they lived for the first few\r\nyears of their married life, No. 12 Upper Gower Street, was a small\r\ncommon-place London house, with a drawing-room in front, and a small\r\nroom behind, in which they lived for the sake of quietness. In later\r\nyears my father used to laugh over the surpassing ugliness of the\r\nfurniture, carpets, &c., of the Gower Street house. The only redeeming\r\nfeature was a better garden than most London houses have, a strip as\r\nwide as the house, and thirty yards long. Even this small space of dingy\r\ngrass made their London house more tolerable to its two country-bred\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nOf his life in London he writes to Fox (October 1839): \"We are living a\r\nlife of extreme quietness; Delamere itself, which you describe as so\r\nsecluded a spot, is, I will answer for it, quite dissipated compared\r\nwith Gower Street. We have given up all parties, for they agree with\r\nneither of us; and if one is quiet in London, there is nothing like its\r\nquietness--there is a grandeur about its smoky fogs, and the dull\r\ndistant sounds of cabs and coaches; in fact you may perceive I am\r\nbecoming a thorough-paced Cockney, and I glory in the thought that I\r\nshall be here for the next six months.\"\r\n\r\nThe entries of ill health in the Diary increase in number during these\r\nyears, and as a consequence the holidays become longer and more\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nThe entry under August 1839 is: \"Read a little, was much unwell and\r\nscandalously idle. I have derived this much good, that _nothing_ is so\r\nintolerable as idleness.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1839 his first child was born, and it was then that he\r\nbegan his observations ultimately published in the _Expression of the\r\nEmotions_. His book on this subject, and the short paper published in\r\n_Mind_,[108] show how closely he observed his child. He seems to have\r\nbeen surprised at his own feeling for a young baby, for he wrote to Fox\r\n(July 1840): \"He [_i.e._ the baby] is so charming that I cannot pretend\r\nto any modesty. I defy anybody to flatter us on our baby, for I defy\r\nanyone to say anything in its praise of which we are not fully\r\nconscious.... I had not the smallest conception there was so much in a\r\nfive-month baby. You will perceive by this that I have a fine degree of\r\npaternal fervour.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1841 some improvement in his health became apparent; he wrote in\r\nSeptember:--\r\n\r\n\"I have steadily been gaining ground, and really believe now I shall\r\nsome day be quite strong. I write daily for a couple of hours on my\r\nCoral volume, and take a little walk or ride every day. I grow very\r\ntired in the evenings, and am not able to go out at that time, or hardly\r\nto receive my nearest relations; but my life ceases to be burdensome now\r\nthat I can do something.\"\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of _Coral Reefs_ was at last sent to the printers in\r\nJanuary 1842, and the last proof corrected in May. He thus writes of the\r\nwork in his diary:--\r\n\r\n\"I commenced this work three years and seven months ago. Out of this\r\nperiod about twenty months (besides work during _Beagle's_ voyage) has\r\nbeen spent on it, and besides it, I have only compiled the Bird part of\r\nZoology; Appendix to Journal, paper on Boulders, and corrected papers on\r\nGlen Roy and earthquakes, reading on species, and rest all lost by\r\nillness.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this year belongs to the period including the\r\nsettlement at Down, and is therefore dealt with in another chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[97] The Museum of the Zoological Society, then at 33 Bruton Street. The\r\ncollection was some years later broken up and dispersed.\r\n\r\n[98] William Lonsdale, b. 1794, d. 1871, was originally in the army, and\r\nserved at the battles of Salamanca and Waterloo. After the war he left\r\nthe service and gave himself up to science.

The bets are not allowed\r\nto be made in money, but are, like the fines, paid in wine. The bet\r\nwhich my father made and lost is thus recorded:--\r\n\r\n\"_Feb. 23, 1837._--Mr. Darwin _v._ Mr. Baines, that the combination-room\r\nmeasures from the ceiling to the floor more than _x_ feet.\r\n\r\n\"1 Bottle paid same day.\"\r\n\r\nThe bets are usually recorded in such a way as not to preclude future\r\nspeculation on a subject which has proved itself capable of supplying a\r\ndiscussion (and a bottle) to the Room, hence the _x_ in the above\r\nquotation.\r\n\r\n[102] Spring Rice.\r\n\r\n[103] _Phil. Trans._, 1839, pp. 39-82.\r\n\r\n[104] Sir Archibald Geikie has been so good as to allow me to quote a\r\npassage from a letter addressed to me (Nov. 19, 1884):--\"Had the idea of\r\ntransient barriers of glacier-ice occurred to him, he would have found\r\nthe difficulties vanish from the lake-theory which he opposed, and he\r\nwould not have been unconsciously led to minimise the altogether\r\noverwhelming objections to the supposition that the terraces are of\r\nmarine origin.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the idea of the barriers being formed by glaciers\r\ncould hardly have occurred to him, considering the state of knowledge at\r\nthe time, and bearing in mind his want of opportunities of observing\r\nglacial action on a large scale.\r\n\r\n[105] In a letter of Sept. 13 he wrote:--\"It will be a curious point to\r\ngeologists hereafter to note how long a man's name will support a theory\r\nso completely exposed as that of De Beaumont has been by you; you say\r\nyou 'begin to hope that the great principles there insisted on will\r\nstand the test of time.' _Begin to hope_: why, the _possibility_ of a\r\ndoubt has never crossed my mind for many a day. This may be very\r\nunphilosophical, but my geological salvation is staked on it.\"\r\n\r\n[106] At the meeting of the British Association.\r\n\r\n[107] Daughter of Josiah Wedgwood of Maer, and grand-daughter of the\r\nfounder of the Etruria Pottery Works.\r\n\r\n[108] July 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLIFE AT DOWN.\r\n\r\n1842-1854.\r\n\r\n     \"My life goes on like clockwork, and I am fixed on the spot where I\r\n     shall end it.\"\r\n\r\n     Letter to Captain Fitz-Roy, October, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain letters which, chronologically considered, belong to the period\r\n1845-54 have been utilised in a later chapter where the growth of the\r\n_Origin of Species_ is described. In the present chapter we only get\r\noccasional hints of the growth of my father's views, and we may suppose\r\nourselves to be seeing his life, as it might have appeared to those who\r\nhad no knowledge of the quiet development of his theory of evolution\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 14, 1842, my father left London with his family and settled at\r\nDown.[109] In the Autobiographical chapter, his motives for moving into\r\nthe country are briefly given. He speaks of the attendance at scientific\r\nsocieties and ordinary social duties as suiting his health so \"badly\r\nthat we resolved to live in the country, which we both preferred and\r\nhave never repented of.\" His intention of keeping up with scientific\r\nlife in London is expressed in a letter to Fox (Dec., 1842):--\r\n\r\n\"I hope by going up to town for a night every fortnight or three weeks,\r\nto keep up my communication with scientific men and my own zeal, and so\r\nnot to turn into a complete Kentish hog.\"\r\n\r\nVisits to London of this kind were kept up for some years at the cost of\r\nmuch exertion on his part. I have often heard him speak of the wearisome\r\ndrives of ten miles to or from Croydon or Sydenham--the nearest\r\nstations--with an old gardener acting as coachman, who drove with great\r\ncaution and slowness up and down the many hills. In later years,\r\nregular scientific intercourse with London became, as before mentioned,\r\nan impossibility.\r\n\r\nThe choice of Down was rather the result of despair than of actual\r\npreference: my father and mother were weary of house-hunting, and the\r\nattractive points about the place thus seemed to them to counterbalance\r\nits somewhat more obvious faults. It had at least one desideratum,\r\nnamely, quietness. Indeed it would have been difficult to find a more\r\nretired place so near to London. In 1842 a coach drive of some twenty\r\nmiles was the usual means of access to Down; and even now that railways\r\nhave crept closer to it, it is singularly out of the world, with nothing\r\nto suggest the neighbourhood of London, unless it be the dull haze of\r\nsmoke that sometimes clouds the sky. The village stands in an angle\r\nbetween two of the larger high-roads of the country, one leading to\r\nTunbridge and the other to Westerham and Edenbridge. It is cut off from\r\nthe Weald by a line of steep chalk hills on the south, and an abrupt\r\nhill, now smoothed down by a cutting and embankment, must formerly have\r\nbeen something of a barrier against encroachments from the side of\r\nLondon. In such a situation, a village, communicating with the main\r\nlines of traffic, only by stony tortuous lanes, may well have preserved\r\nits retired character. Nor is it hard to believe in the smugglers and\r\ntheir strings of pack-horses making their way up from the lawless old\r\nvillages of the Weald, of which the memory still existed when my father\r\nsettled in Down. The village stands on solitary upland country, 500 to\r\n600 feet above the sea--a country with little natural beauty, but\r\npossessing a certain charm in the shaws, or straggling strips of wood,\r\ncapping the chalky banks and looking down upon the quiet ploughed lands\r\nof the valleys. The village, of three or four hundred inhabitants,\r\nconsists of three small streets of cottages meeting in front of the\r\nlittle flint-built church. It is a place where new-comers are seldom\r\nseen, and the names occurring far back in the old church registers are\r\nstill known in the village. The smock-frock is not yet quite extinct,\r\nthough chiefly used as a ceremonial dress by the \"bearers\" at funerals;\r\nbut as a boy I remember the purple or green smocks of the men at church.\r\n\r\nThe house stands a quarter of a mile from the village, and is built,\r\nlike so many houses of the last century, as near as possible to the\r\nroad--a narrow lane winding away to the Westerham high-road. In 1842, it\r\nwas dull and unattractive enough: a square brick building of three\r\nstoreys, covered with shabby whitewash, and hanging tiles. The garden\r\nhad none of the shrubberies or walls that now give shelter; it was\r\noverlooked from the lane, and was open, bleak, and desolate. One of my\r\nfather's first undertakings was to lower the lane by about two feet, and\r\nto build a flint wall along that part of it which bordered the garden.\r\nThe earth thus excavated was used in making banks and mounds round the\r\nlawn: these were planted with evergreens, which now give to the garden\r\nits retired and sheltered character.\r\n\r\nThe house was made to look neater by being covered with stucco, but the\r\nchief improvement effected was the building of a large bow extending up\r\nthrough three storeys. This bow became covered with a tangle of\r\ncreepers, and pleasantly varied the south side of the house. The\r\ndrawing-room, with its verandah opening into the garden, as well as the\r\nstudy in which my father worked during the later years of his life, were\r\nadded at subsequent dates.\r\n\r\nEighteen acres of land were sold with the house, of which twelve acres\r\non the south side of the house form a pleasant field, scattered with\r\nfair-sized oaks and ashes. From this field a strip was cut off and\r\nconverted into a kitchen garden, in which the experimental plot of\r\nground was situated, and where the greenhouses were ultimately put up.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of 1843 he was occupied with geological work, the\r\nresult of which was published in the spring of the following year. It\r\nwas entitled _Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands, visited\r\nduring the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, together with some brief notices on\r\nthe geology of Australia and the Cape of Good Hope_; it formed the\r\nsecond part of the _Geology of the Voyage of the Beagle_, published\r\n\"with the Approval of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's\r\nTreasury.\" The volume on _Coral Reefs_ forms Part I. of the series, and\r\nwas published, as we have seen, in 1842. For the sake of the\r\nnon-geological reader, I may here quote Sir A. Geikie's words[110] on\r\nthese two volumes--which were up to this time my father's chief\r\ngeological works. Speaking of the _Coral Reefs_, he says (p. 17): \"This\r\nwell-known treatise, the most original of all its author's geological\r\nmemoirs, has become one of the classics of geological literature. The\r\norigin of those remarkable rings of coral-rock in mid-ocean has given\r\nrise to much speculation, but no satisfactory solution of the problem\r\nhad been proposed. After visiting many of them, and examining also coral\r\nreefs that fringe islands and continents, he offered a theory which for\r\nsimplicity and grandeur, strikes every reader with astonishment. It is\r\npleasant, after the lapse of many years, to recall the delight with\r\nwhich one first read the _Coral Reefs_, how one watched the facts being\r\nmarshalled into their places, nothing being ignored or passed lightly\r\nover; and how, step by step, one was led to the grand conclusion of wide\r\noceanic subsidence. No more admirable example of scientific method was\r\never given to the world, and even if he had written nothing else, the\r\ntreatise alone would have placed Darwin in the very front of\r\ninvestigators of nature.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see in the following extract from one of Lyell's\r\nletters[111] how warmly and readily he embraced the theory. The extract\r\nalso gives incidentally some idea of the theory itself.\r\n\r\n\"I am very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged\r\nWhewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my\r\nvolcanic crater theory for ever, though it cost me a pang at first, for\r\nit accounted for so much, the annular form, the central lagoon, the\r\nsudden rising of an isolated mountain in a deep sea; all went so well\r\nwith the notion of submerged, crateriform, and conical volcanoes, ...\r\nand then the fact that in the South Pacific we had scarcely any rocks in\r\nthe regions of coral islands, save two kinds, coral limestone and\r\nvolcanic! Yet in spite of all this, the whole theory is knocked on the\r\nhead, and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with\r\nvolcanoes, nor even with a crateriform bottom. Perhaps Darwin told you\r\nwhen at the Cape what he considers the true cause? Let any mountain be\r\nsubmerged gradually, and coral grow in the sea in which it is sinking,\r\nand there will be a ring of coral, and finally only a lagoon in the\r\ncentre.... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to\r\nlift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and subsidence in the\r\nocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs.\"\r\n\r\nThe second part of the _Geology of the Voyage of the Beagle_, _i.e._ the\r\nvolume on Volcanic Islands, which specially concerns us now, cannot be\r\nbetter described than by again quoting from Sir A. Geikie (p. 18):--\r\n\r\n\"Full of detailed observations, this work still remains the best\r\nauthority on the general geological structure of most of the regions it\r\ndescribes. At the time it was written the 'crater of elevation theory,'\r\nthough opposed by Constant Prevost, Scrope, and Lyell, was generally\r\naccepted, at least on the Continent. Darwin, however, could not receive\r\nit as a valid explanation of the facts; and though he did not share the\r\nview of its chief opponents, but ventured to propose a hypothesis of his\r\nown, the observations impartially made and described by him in this\r\nvolume must be regarded as having contributed towards the final solution\r\nof the difficulty.\" Geikie continues (p. 21): \"He is one of the earliest\r\nwriters to recognize the magnitude of the denudation to which even\r\nrecent geological accumulations have been subjected. One of the most\r\nimpressive lessons to be learnt from his account of 'Volcanic Islands'\r\nis the prodigious extent to which they have been denuded.... He was\r\ndisposed to attribute more of this work to the sea than most geologists\r\nwould now admit; but he lived himself to modify his original views, and\r\non this subject his latest utterances are quite abreast of the time.\"\r\n\r\nAn extract from a letter of my father's to Lyell shows his estimate of\r\nhis own work. \"You have pleased me much by saying that you intend\r\nlooking through my _Volcanic Islands_: it cost me eighteen months!!! and\r\nI have heard of very few who have read it.[112] Now I shall feel,\r\nwhatever little (and little it is) there is confirmatory of old work, or\r\nnew, will work its effect and not be lost.\"\r\n\r\nThe second edition of the _Journal of Researches_[113] was completed in\r\n1845. It was published by Mr. Murray in the _Colonial and Home Library_,\r\nand in this more accessible form soon had a large sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Lyell._ Down [July, 1845].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL--I send you the first part[114] of the new edition, which\r\nI so entirely owe to you. You will see that I have ventured to dedicate\r\nit to you, and I trust that this cannot be disagreeable. I have long\r\nwished, not so much for your sake, as for my own feelings of honesty, to\r\nacknowledge more plainly than by mere reference, how much I\r\ngeologically owe you. Those authors, however, who, like you, educate\r\npeople's minds as well as teach them special facts, can never, I should\r\nthink, have full justice done them except by posterity, for the mind\r\nthus insensibly improved can hardly perceive its own upward ascent. I\r\nhad intended putting in the present acknowledgment in the third part of\r\nmy Geology, but its sale is so exceedingly small that I should not have\r\nhad the satisfaction of thinking that as far as lay in my power I had\r\nowned, though imperfectly, my debt. Pray do not think that I am so\r\nsilly, as to suppose that my dedication can any ways gratify you, except\r\nso far as I trust you will receive it, as a most sincere mark of my\r\ngratitude and friendship. I think I have improved this edition,\r\nespecially the second part, which I have just finished. I have added a\r\ngood deal about the Fuegians, and cut down into half the mercilessly\r\nlong discussion on climate and glaciers, &c. I do not recollect anything\r\nadded to the first part, long enough to call your attention to; there is\r\na page of description of a very curious breed of oxen in Banda Oriental.\r\nI should like you to read the few last pages; there is a little\r\ndiscussion on extinction, which will not perhaps strike you as new,\r\nthough it has so struck me, and has placed in my mind all the\r\ndifficulties with respect to the causes of extinction, in the same class\r\nwith other difficulties which are generally quite overlooked and\r\nundervalued by naturalists; I ought, however, to have made my discussion\r\nlonger and shown by facts, as I easily could, how steadily every species\r\nmust be checked in its numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pleasant notice of the _Journal_ occurs in a letter from Humboldt to\r\nMrs. Austin, dated June 7, 1844[115]:--\r\n\r\n\"Alas! you have got some one in England whom you do not read--young\r\nDarwin, who went with the expedition to the Straits of Magellan. He has\r\nsucceeded far better than myself with the subject I took up. There are\r\nadmirable descriptions of tropical nature in his journal, which you do\r\nnot read because the author is a zoologist, which you imagine to be\r\nsynonymous with bore. Mr. Darwin has another merit, a very rare one in\r\nyour country--he has praised me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 1846 to October 1854._\r\n\r\nThe time between October 1846, and October 1854, was practically given\r\nup to working at the Cirripedia (Barnacles); the results were published\r\nin two volumes by the Ray Society in 1851 and 1854. His volumes on the\r\nFossil Cirripedes were published by the Palaeontographical Society in\r\n1851 and 1854.\r\n\r\nWriting to Sir J. D. Hooker in 1845, my father says: \"I hope this next\r\nsummer to finish my South American Geology,[116] then to get out a\r\nlittle Zoology, and hurrah for my species work....\" This passage serves\r\nto show that he had at this time no intention of making an exhaustive\r\nstudy of the Cirripedes. Indeed it would seem that his original\r\nintention was, as I learn from Sir J. D. Hooker, merely to work out one\r\nspecial problem. This is quite in keeping with the following passage in\r\nthe _Autobiography_: \"When on the coast of Chile, I found a most curious\r\nform, which burrowed into the shells of Concholepas, and which differed\r\nso much from all other Cirripedes that I had to form a new sub-order for\r\nits sole reception.... To understand the structure of my new Cirripede I\r\nhad to examine and dissect many of the common forms; and this gradually\r\nled me on to take up the whole group.\" In later years he seems to have\r\nfelt some doubt as to the value of these eight years of work--for\r\ninstance when he wrote in his _Autobiography_--\"My work was of\r\nconsiderable use to me, when I had to discuss in the _Origin of Species_\r\nthe principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless I doubt whether\r\nthe work was worth the consumption of so much time.\" Yet I learn from\r\nSir J. D. Hooker that he certainly recognised at the time its value to\r\nhimself as systematic training. Sir Joseph writes to me: \"Your father\r\nrecognised three stages in his career as a biologist: the mere collector\r\nat Cambridge; the collector and observer in the _Beagle_, and for some\r\nyears afterwards; and the trained naturalist after, and only after the\r\nCirripede work. That he was a thinker all along is true enough, and\r\nthere is a vast deal in his writings previous to the Cirripedes that a\r\ntrained naturalist could but emulate.... He often alluded to it as a\r\nvalued discipline, and added that even the 'hateful' work of digging out\r\nsynonyms, and of describing, not only improved his methods but opened\r\nhis eyes to the difficulties and merits of the works of the dullest of\r\ncataloguers. One result was that he would never allow a depreciatory\r\nremark to pass unchallenged on the poorest class of scientific workers,\r\nprovided that their work was honest, and good of its kind. I have always\r\nregarded it as one of the finest traits of his character,--this generous\r\nappreciation of the hod-men of science, and of their labours ... and it\r\nwas monographing the Barnacles that brought it about.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley allows me to quote his opinion as to the value of the eight\r\nyears given to the Cirripedes:--\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion your sagacious father never did a wiser thing than when\r\nhe devoted himself to the years of patient toil which the Cirripede-book\r\ncost him.\r\n\r\n\"Like the rest of us, he had no proper training in biological science,\r\nand it has always struck me as a remarkable instance of his scientific\r\ninsight, that he saw the necessity of giving himself such training, and\r\nof his courage, that he did not shirk the labour of obtaining it.\r\n\r\n\"The great danger which besets all men of large speculative faculty, is\r\nthe temptation to deal with the accepted statements of fact in natural\r\nscience, as if they were not only correct, but exhaustive; as if they\r\nmight be dealt with deductively, in the same way as propositions in\r\nEuclid may be dealt with. In reality, every such statement, however true\r\nit may be, is true only relatively to the means of observation and the\r\npoint of view of those who have enunciated it. So far it may be depended\r\nupon. But whether it will bear every speculative conclusion that may be\r\nlogically deduced from it, is quite another question.\r\n\r\n\"Your father was building a vast superstructure upon the foundations\r\nfurnished by the recognised facts of geological and biological science.\r\nIn Physical Geography, in Geology proper, in Geographical Distribution,\r\nand in Palaeontology, he had acquired an extensive practical training\r\nduring the voyage of the _Beagle_. He knew of his own knowledge the way\r\nin which the raw materials of these branches of science are acquired,\r\nand was therefore a most competent judge of the speculative strain they\r\nwould bear. That which he needed, after his return to England, was a\r\ncorresponding acquaintance with Anatomy and Development, and their\r\nrelation to Taxonomy--and he acquired this by his Cirripede work.\"\r\n\r\nThough he became excessively weary of the work before the end of the\r\neight years, he had much keen enjoyment in the course of it. Thus he\r\nwrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (1847?):--\"As you say, there is an\r\nextraordinary pleasure in pure observation; not but what I suspect the\r\npleasure in this case is rather derived from comparisons forming in\r\none's mind with allied structures. After having been so long employed\r\nin writing my old geological observations, it is delightful to use one's\r\neyes and fingers again.\" It was, in fact, a return to the work which\r\noccupied so much of his time when at sea during his voyage. Most of his\r\nwork was done with the simple dissecting microscope--and it was the need\r\nwhich he found for higher powers that induced him, in 1846, to buy a\r\ncompound microscope. He wrote to Hooker:--\"When I was drawing with L., I\r\nwas so delighted with the appearance of the objects, especially with\r\ntheir perspective, as seen through the weak powers of a good compound\r\nmicroscope, that I am going to order one; indeed, I often have\r\nstructures in which the 1/30 is not power enough.\"\r\n\r\nDuring part of the time covered by the present chapter, my father\r\nsuffered perhaps more from ill-health than at any other period of his\r\nlife. He felt severely the depressing influence of these long years of\r\nillness; thus as early as 1840 he wrote to Fox: \"I am grown a dull, old,\r\nspiritless dog to what I used to be. One gets stupider as one grows\r\nolder I think.\" It is not wonderful that he should so have written, it\r\nis rather to be wondered at that his spirit withstood so great and\r\nconstant a strain. He wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker in 1845: \"You are very\r\nkind in your inquiries about my health; I have nothing to say about it,\r\nbeing always much the same, some days better and some worse. I believe I\r\nhave not had one whole day, or rather night, without my stomach having\r\nbeen greatly disordered, during the last three years, and most days\r\ngreat prostration of strength: thank you for your kindness; many of my\r\nfriends, I believe, think me a hypochondriac.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the period now under consideration, he was in\r\nconstant correspondence with Sir Joseph Hooker. The following\r\ncharacteristic letter on Sigillaria (a gigantic fossil plant found in\r\nthe Coal Measures) was afterwards characterised by himself as not being\r\n\"reasoning, or even speculation, but simply as mental rioting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Down, 1847?]\r\n\r\n\" ... I am delighted to hear that Brongniart thought Sigillaria aquatic,\r\nand that Binney considers coal a sort of submarine peat. I would bet 5\r\nto 1 that in twenty years this will be generally admitted;[117] and I do\r\nnot care for whatever the botanical difficulties or impossibilities may\r\nbe. If I could but persuade myself that Sigillaria and Co. had a good\r\nrange of depth, _i.e._ could live from 5 to 10 fathoms under water, all\r\ndifficulties of nearly all kinds would be removed (for the simple fact\r\nof muddy ordinary shallow sea implies proximity of land). [N.B.--I am\r\nchuckling to think how you are sneering all this time.] It is not much\r\nof a difficulty, there not being shells with the coal, considering how\r\nunfavourable deep mud is for most Mollusca, and that shells would\r\nprobably decay from the humic acid, as seems to take place in peat and\r\nin the _black_ moulds (as Lyell tells me) of the Mississippi. So coal\r\nquestion settled--Q. E. D. Sneer away!\"\r\n\r\nThe two following extracts give the continuation and conclusion of the\r\ncoal battle.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, as submarine coal made you so wrath, I thought I would\r\nexperimentise on Falconer and Bunbury[118] together, and it made [them]\r\neven more savage; 'such infernal nonsense ought to be thrashed out of\r\nme.' Bunbury was more polite and contemptuous. So I now know how to stir\r\nup and show off any Botanist. I wonder whether Zoologists and Geologists\r\nhave got their tender points; I wish I could find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot resist thanking you for your most kind note. Pray do not think\r\nthat I was annoyed by your letter: I perceived that you had been\r\nthinking with animation, and accordingly expressed yourself strongly,\r\nand so I understood it. Forfend me from a man who weighs every\r\nexpression with Scotch prudence. I heartily wish you all success in your\r\nnoble problem, and I shall be very curious to have some talk with you\r\nand hear your ultimatum.\"\r\n\r\nHe also corresponded with the late Hugh Strickland,--a well-known\r\nornithologist, on the need of reform in the principle of nomenclature.\r\nThe following extract (1849) gives an idea of my father's view:--\r\n\r\n\"I feel sure as long as species-mongers have their vanity tickled by\r\nseeing their own names appended to a species, because they miserably\r\ndescribed it in two or three lines, we shall have the same _vast_ amount\r\nof bad work as at present, and which is enough to dishearten any man who\r\nis willing to work out any branch with care and time. I find every genus\r\nof Cirripedia has half-a-dozen names, and not one careful description of\r\nany one species in any one genus. I do not believe that this would have\r\nbeen the case if each man knew that the memory of his own name depended\r\non his doing his work well, and not upon merely appending a name with a\r\nfew wretched lines indicating only a few prominent external\r\ncharacters.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Dr. R. W. Darwin died, and Charles Darwin wrote to Hooker, from\r\nMalvern:--\r\n\r\n\"On the 13th of November, my poor dear father died, and no one who did\r\nnot know him would believe that a man above eighty-three years old could\r\nhave retained so tender and affectionate a disposition, with all his\r\nsagacity unclouded to the last. I was at the time so unwell, that I was\r\nunable to travel, which added to my misery.\r\n\r\n\"All this winter I have been bad enough ... and my nervous system began\r\nto be affected, so that my hands trembled, and head was often swimming.\r\nI was not able to do anything one day out of three, and was altogether\r\ntoo dispirited to write to you, or to do anything but what I was\r\ncompelled. I thought I was rapidly going the way of all flesh. Having\r\nheard, accidentally, of two persons who had received much benefit from\r\nthe water-cure, I got Dr. Gully's book, and made further inquiries, and\r\nat last started here, with wife, children, and all our servants. We have\r\ntaken a house for two months, and have been here a fortnight. I am\r\nalready a little stronger.... Dr. Gully feels pretty sure he can do me\r\ngood, which most certainly the regular doctors could not.... I feel\r\ncertain that the water-cure is no quackery.\r\n\r\n\"How I shall enjoy getting back to Down with renovated health, if such\r\nis to be my good fortune, and resuming the beloved Barnacles. Now I hope\r\nthat you will forgive me for my negligence in not having sooner answered\r\nyour letter. I was uncommonly interested by the sketch you give of your\r\nintended grand expedition, from which I suppose you will soon be\r\nreturning. How earnestly I hope that it may prove in every way\r\nsuccessful....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to W. D. Fox_. [March 7, 1852.]\r\n\r\nOur long silence occurred to me a few weeks since, and I had then\r\nthought of writing, but was idle. I congratulate and condole with you on\r\nyour _tenth_ child; but please to observe when I have a tenth, send only\r\ncondolences to me. We have now seven children, all well, thank God, as\r\nwell as their mother; of these seven, five are boys; and my father used\r\nto say that it was certain that a boy gave as much trouble as three\r\ngirls; so that _bona fide_ we have seventeen children. It makes me sick\r\nwhenever I think of professions; all seem hopelessly bad, and as yet I\r\ncannot see a ray of light. I should very much like to talk over this\r\n(by the way, my three bugbears are Californian and Australian gold,\r\nbeggaring me by making my money on mortgage worth nothing; the French\r\ncoming by the Westerham and Sevenoaks roads, and therefore enclosing\r\nDown; and thirdly, professions for my boys), and I should like to talk\r\nabout education, on which you ask me what we are doing. No one can more\r\ntruly despise the old stereotyped stupid classical education than I do;\r\nbut yet I have not had courage to break through the trammels. After many\r\ndoubts we have just sent our eldest boy to Rugby, where for his age he\r\nhas been very well placed.... I honour, admire, and envy you for\r\neducating your boys at home. What on earth shall you do with your boys?\r\nVery many thanks for your most kind and large invitation to Delamere,\r\nbut I fear we can hardly compass it. I dread going anywhere, on account\r\nof my stomach so easily failing under any excitement. I rarely even now\r\ngo to London, not that I am at all worse, perhaps rather better, and\r\nlead a very comfortable life with my three hours of daily work, but it\r\nis the life of a hermit. My nights are _always_ bad, and that stops my\r\nbecoming vigorous. You ask about water-cure. I take at intervals of two\r\nor three months, five or six weeks of _moderately_ severe treatment, and\r\nalways with good effect. Do you come here, I pray and beg whenever you\r\ncan find time; you cannot tell how much pleasure it would give me and E.\r\nWhat pleasant times we had in drinking coffee in your rooms at Christ's\r\nCollege, and think of the glories of Crux-major.[119] Ah, in those days\r\nthere were no professions for sons, no ill-health to fear for them, no\r\nCalifornian gold, no French invasions. How paramount the future is to\r\nthe present when one is surrounded by children. My dread is hereditary\r\nill-health. Even death is better for them.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox, your sincere friend.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Susan[120] has lately been working in a way which I think truly\r\nheroic about the scandalous violation of the Act against children\r\nclimbing chimneys. We have set up a little Society in Shrewsbury to\r\nprosecute those who break the law. It is all Susan's doing. She has had\r\nvery nice letters from Lord Shaftesbury and the Duke of Sutherland, but\r\nthe brutal Shropshire squires are as hard as stones to move. The Act out\r\nof London seems most commonly violated. It makes one shudder to fancy\r\none of one's own children at seven years old being forced up a\r\nchimney--to say nothing of the consequent loathsome disease and\r\nulcerated limbs, and utter moral degradation. If you think strongly on\r\nthis subject, do make some enquiries; add to your many good works, this\r\nother one, and try to stir up the magistrates....\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to the Royal Medal, which was awarded to him\r\nin November, 1853:\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker_. Down [November 1853].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER--Amongst my letters received this morning, I opened first\r\none from Colonel Sabine; the contents certainly surprised me very much,\r\nbut, though the letter was a _very kind one_, somehow, I cared very\r\nlittle indeed for the announcement it contained. I then opened yours,\r\nand such is the effect of warmth, friendship, and kindness from one that\r\nis loved, that the very same fact, told as you told it, made me glow\r\nwith pleasure till my very heart throbbed. Believe me, I shall not soon\r\nforget the pleasure of your letter. Such hearty, affectionate sympathy\r\nis worth more than all the medals that ever were or will be coined.\r\nAgain, my dear Hooker, I thank you. I hope Lindley[121] will never hear\r\nthat he was a competitor against me; for really it is almost\r\n_ridiculous_ (of course you would never repeat that I said this, for it\r\nwould be thought by others, though not, I believe by you, to be\r\naffectation) his not having the medal long before me; I must feel _sure_\r\nthat you did quite right to propose him; and what a good, dear, kind\r\nfellow you are, nevertheless, to rejoice in this honour being bestowed\r\non me.\r\n\r\nWhat _pleasure_ I have felt on the occasion, I owe almost entirely to\r\nyou.[122]\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear Hooker, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following series of extracts, must, for want of space, serve as a\r\nsketch of his feeling with regard to his seven years' work at\r\nBarnacles[123]:--\r\n\r\n_September 1849._--\"It makes me groan to think that probably I shall\r\nnever again have the exquisite pleasure of making out some new district,\r\nof evolving geological light out of some troubled dark region. So I must\r\nmake the best of my Cirripedia....\"\r\n\r\n_October 1849._--\"I have of late been at work at mere species\r\ndescribing, which is much more difficult than I expected, and has much\r\nthe same sort of interest as a puzzle has; but I confess I often feel\r\nwearied with the work, and cannot help sometimes asking myself what is\r\nthe good of spending a week or fortnight in ascertaining that certain\r\njust perceptible differences blend together and constitute varieties and\r\nnot species. As long as I am on anatomy I never feel myself in that\r\ndisgusting, horrid, _cui bono_, inquiring, humour. What miserable work,\r\nagain, it is searching for priority of names. I have just finished two\r\nspecies, which possess seven generic, and twenty-four specific names! My\r\nchief comfort is, that the work must be sometime done, and I may as well\r\ndo it, as any one else.\"\r\n\r\n_October 1852._--\"I am at work at the second volume of the Cirripedia,\r\nof which creatures I am wonderfully tired. I hate a Barnacle as no man\r\never did before, not even a sailor in a slow-sailing ship. My first\r\nvolume is out; the only part worth looking at is on the sexes of Ibla\r\nand Scalpellum. I hope by next summer to have done with my tedious\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n_July 1853._--\"I am _extremely_ glad to hear that you approved of my\r\ncirripedial volume. I have spent an almost ridiculous amount of labour\r\non the subject, and certainly would never have undertaken it had I\r\nforeseen what a job it was.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1854, his Cirripede work was practically finished, and he\r\nwrote to Sir J. Hooker:\r\n\r\n\"I have been frittering away my time for the last several weeks in a\r\nwearisome manner, partly idleness, and odds and ends, find sending ten\r\nthousand Barnacles[124] out of the house all over the world. But I shall\r\nnow in a day or two begin to look over my old notes on species. What a\r\ndeal I shall have to discuss with you; I shall have to look sharp that I\r\ndo not 'progress' into one of the greatest bores in life, to the few\r\nlike you with lots of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109] I must not omit to mention a member of the household who\r\naccompanied him. This was his butler, Joseph Parslow, who remained in\r\nthe family, a valued friend and servant, for forty years, and became, as\r\nSir Joseph Hooker once remarked to me, \"an integral part of the family,\r\nand felt to be such by all visitors at the house.\"\r\n\r\n[110] Charles Darwin, _Nature_ Series, 1882.\r\n\r\n[111] To Sir John Herschel, May 24, 1837. _Life of Sir Charles Lyell_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 12.\r\n\r\n[112] He wrote to Herbert:--\"I have long discovered that geologists\r\nnever read each other's works, and that the only object in writing a\r\nbook is a proof of earnestness, and that you do not form your opinions\r\nwithout undergoing labour of some kind. Geology is at present very oral,\r\nand what I here say is to a great extent quite true.\" And to Fitz-Roy,\r\non the same subject, he wrote: \"I have sent my _South American Geology_\r\nto Dover Street, and you will get it, no doubt, in the course of time.\r\nYou do not know what you threaten when you propose to read it--it is\r\npurely geological. I said to my brother, 'You will of course read it,'\r\nand his answer was, 'Upon my life, I would sooner even buy it.'\"\r\n\r\n[113] The first edition was published in 1839, as vol. iii. of the\r\n_Voyages of the 'Adventure' and 'Beagle.'_\r\n\r\n[114] No doubt proof-sheets.\r\n\r\n[115] _Three Generations of Englishwomen_, by Janet Ross (1888), vol. i.\r\np. 195.\r\n\r\n[116] This refers to the third and last of his geological books,\r\n_Geological Observation on South America_, which was published in 1846.\r\nA sentence from a letter of Dec. 11, 1860, may be quoted here--\"David\r\nForbes has been carefully working the Geology of Chile, and as I value\r\npraise for accurate observation far higher than for any other quality,\r\nforgive (if you can) the _insufferable_ vanity of my copying the last\r\nsentence in his note: 'I regard your Monograph on Chile as, without\r\nexception, one of the finest specimens of Geological inquiry.' I feel\r\ninclined to strut like a turkey-cock!\"\r\n\r\n[117] An unfulfilled prophecy.\r\n\r\n[118] The late Sir C. Bunbury, well known as a palaeobotanist.\r\n\r\n[119] The beetle Panagaeus crux-major.\r\n\r\n[120] His sister.\r\n\r\n[121] John Lindley (b. 1799, d. 1865) was the son of a nurseryman near\r\nNorwich, through whose failure in business he was thrown at the age of\r\ntwenty on his own resources. He was befriended by Sir W. Hooker, and\r\nemployed as assistant librarian by Sir J. Banks. He seems to have had\r\nenormous capacity for work, and is said to have translated Richard's\r\n_Analyse du Fruit_ at one sitting of two days and three nights. He\r\nbecame Assistant-Secretary to the Horticultural Society, and in 1829 was\r\nappointed Professor of Botany at University College, a post which he\r\nheld for upwards of thirty years. His writings are numerous; the best\r\nknown being perhaps his _Vegetable Kingdom_, published in 1846.\r\n\r\n[122] Shortly afterwards he received a fresh mark of esteem from his\r\nwarm-hearted friend: \"Hooker's book (_Himalayan Journal_) is out, and\r\n_most beautifully_ got up. He has honoured me beyond measure by\r\ndedicating it to me!\"\r\n\r\n[123] In 1860 he wrote to Lyell: \"Is not Krohn a good fellow? I have\r\nlong meant to write to him. He has been working at Cirripedes, and has\r\ndetected two or three gigantic blunders, about which, I thank Heaven, I\r\nspoke rather doubtfully. Such difficult dissection that even Huxley\r\nfailed. It is chiefly the interpretation which I put on parts that is so\r\nwrong, and not the parts which I describe. But they were gigantic\r\nblunders, and why I say all this is because Krohn, instead of crowing at\r\nall, pointed out my errors with the utmost gentleness and pleasantness.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two papers by Aug. Krohn, one on the Cement Glands, and the\r\nother on the development of Cirripedes, _Weigmann's Archiv._ xxv. and\r\nxxvi. See _Autobiography_, p. 39, where my father remarks, \"I blundered\r\ndreadfully about the cement glands.\"\r\n\r\n[124] The duplicate type-specimens of my father's Cirripedes are in the\r\nLiverpool Free Public Museum, as I learn from the Rev. H. H. Higgins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give an account of the development of the chief work of my father's\r\nlife--the _Origin of Species_, it will be necessary to return to an\r\nearlier date, and to weave into the story letters and other material,\r\npurposely omitted from the chapters dealing with the voyage and with his\r\nlife at Down.\r\n\r\nTo be able to estimate the greatness of the work, we must know something\r\nof the state of knowledge on the species question at the time when the\r\ngerms of the Darwinian theory were forming in my father's mind.\r\n\r\nFor the brief sketch which I can here insert, I am largely indebted to\r\nvol. ii. chapter v. of the _Life and Letters_--a discussion on the\r\n_Reception of the Origin of Species_ which Mr. Huxley \"was good enough\r\nto write for me, also to the masterly obituary essay on my father, which\r\nthe same writer contributed to the Proceedings of the Royal\r\nSociety.\"[125]\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley has well said[126]:\r\n\r\n\"To any one who studies the signs of the times, the emergence of the\r\nphilosophy of Evolution, in the attitude of claimant to the throne of\r\nthe world of thought, from the limbo of hated and, as many hoped,\r\nforgotten things, is the most portentous event of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autobiographical chapter, my father has given an account of his\r\nshare in this great work: the present chapter does little more than\r\nexpand that story.\r\n\r\nTwo questions naturally occur to one: (1)--When and how did Darwin\r\nbecome convinced that species are mutable? How (that is to say) did he\r\nbegin to believe in evolution. And (2)--When and how did he conceive the\r\nmanner in which species are modified; when did he begin to believe in\r\nNatural Selection?\r\n\r\nThe first question is the more difficult of the two to answer. He has\r\nsaid in the _Autobiography_ (p. 39) that certain facts observed by him\r\nin South America seemed to be explicable only on the \"supposition that\r\nspecies gradually become modified.\" He goes on to say that the subject\r\n\"haunted him\"; and I think it is especially worthy of note that this\r\n\"haunting,\"--this unsatisfied dwelling on the subject was connected with\r\nthe desire to explain _how_ species can be modified. It was\r\ncharacteristic of him to feel, as he did, that it was \"almost useless\"\r\nto endeavour to prove the general truth of evolution, unless the cause\r\nof change could be discovered. I think that throughout his life the\r\nquestions 1 and 2 were intimately,--perhaps unduly so, connected in his\r\nmind. It will be shown, however, that after the publication of the\r\n_Origin_, when his views were being weighed in the balance of scientific\r\nopinion, it was to the acceptance of Evolution not of Natural Selection\r\nthat he attached importance.\r\n\r\nAn interesting letter (Feb. 24, 1877) to Dr. Otto Zacharias,[127] gives\r\nthe same impression as the _Autobiography_:--\r\n\r\n\"When I was on board the _Beagle_ I believed in the permanence of\r\nspecies, but as far as I can remember, vague doubts occasionally flitted\r\nacross my mind. On my return home in the autumn of 1836, I immediately\r\nbegan to prepare my Journal for publication, and then saw how many facts\r\nindicated the common descent of species, so that in July, 1837, I opened\r\na note-book to record any facts which might bear on the question. But I\r\ndid not become convinced that species were mutable until, I think, two\r\nor three years had elapsed.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years bring us to 1839, at which date the idea of natural selection\r\nhad already occurred to him--a fact which agrees with what has been said\r\nabove. How far the idea that evolution is conceivable came to him from\r\nearlier writers it is not possible to say. He has recorded in the\r\n_Autobiography_ (p. 38) the \"silent astonishment with which, about the\r\nyear 1825, he heard Grant expound the Lamarckian philosophy.\" He goes\r\non:--\r\n\r\n\"I had previously read the _Zoonomia_ of my grandfather, in which\r\nsimilar views are maintained, but without producing any effect on me.\r\nNevertheless, it is probable that the hearing rather early in life such\r\nviews maintained and praised, may have favoured my upholding them under\r\na different form in my _Origin of Species_. At this time I admired\r\ngreatly the _Zoonomia_; but on reading it a second time after an\r\ninterval of ten or fifteen years, I was much disappointed; the\r\nproportion of speculation being so large to the facts given.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley has well said (Obituary Notice, p. ii.): \"Erasmus Darwin,\r\nwas in fact an anticipator of Lamarck, and not of Charles Darwin; there\r\nis no trace in his works of the conception by the addition of which his\r\ngrandson metamorphosed the theory of evolution as applied to living\r\nthings, and gave it a new foundation.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole it seems to me that the effect on his mind of the earlier\r\nevolutionists was inappreciable, and as far as concerns the history of\r\nthe _Origin of the Species_, it is of no particular importance, because,\r\nas before said, evolution made no progress in his mind until the cause\r\nof modification was conceivable.\r\n\r\nI think Mr. Huxley is right in saying[128] that \"it is hardly too much\r\nto say that Darwin's greatest work is the outcome of the unflinching\r\napplication to biology of the leading idea, and the method applied in\r\nthe _Principles_ to Geology.\" Mr. Huxley has elsewhere[129] admirably\r\nexpressed the bearing of Lyell's work in this connection:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot but believe that Lyell, for others, as for myself, was the\r\nchief agent in smoothing the road for Darwin. For consistent\r\nuniformitarianism postulates evolution as much in the organic as in the\r\ninorganic world. The origin of a new species by other than ordinary\r\nagencies would be a vastly greater 'catastrophe' than any of those which\r\nLyell successfully eliminated from sober geological speculation....\r\n\r\n\"Lyell,[130] with perfect right, claims this position for himself. He\r\nspeaks of having 'advocated a law of continuity even in the organic\r\nworld, so far as possible without adopting Lamarck's theory of\r\ntransmutation....\r\n\r\n\"'But while I taught,' Lyell goes on, 'that as often as certain forms of\r\nanimals and plants disappeared, for reasons quite intelligible to us,\r\nothers took their place by virtue of a causation which was beyond our\r\ncomprehension; it remained for Darwin to accumulate proof that there is\r\nno break between the incoming and the outgoing species, that they are\r\nthe work of evolution, and not of special creation.... I had certainly\r\nprepared the way in this country, in six editions of my work before the\r\n_Vestiges of Creation_ appeared in 1842 [1844], for the reception of\r\nDarwin's gradual and insensible evolution of species.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley continues:--\r\n\r\n\"If one reads any of the earlier editions of the _Principles_ carefully\r\n(especially by the light of the interesting series of letters recently\r\npublished by Sir Charles Lyell's biographer), it is easy to see that,\r\nwith all his energetic opposition to Lamarck, on the one hand, and to\r\nthe ideal quasi-progressionism of Agassiz, on the other, Lyell, in his\r\nown mind, was strongly disposed to account for the origination of all\r\npast and present species of living things by natural causes. But he\r\nwould have liked, at the same time, to keep the name of creation for a\r\nnatural process which he imagined to be incomprehensible.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage above given refers to the influence of Lyell in preparing\r\nmen's minds for belief in the _Origin_, but I cannot doubt that it\r\n\"smoothed the way\" for the author of that work in his early searchings,\r\nas well as for his followers. My father spoke prophetically when he\r\nwrote the dedication to Lyell of the second edition of the _Journal of\r\nResearches_ (1845).\r\n\r\n\"To Charles Lyell, Esq., F.R.S., this second edition is dedicated with\r\ngrateful pleasure--as an acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever\r\nscientific merit this journal and the other works of the author may\r\npossess, has been derived from studying the well-known and admirable\r\n_Principles of Geology_.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Judd, in some reminiscences of my father which he was so good\r\nas to give me, quotes him as saying that, \"It was the reading of the\r\n_Principles of Geology_ which did most towards moulding his mind and\r\ncausing him to take up the line of investigation to which his life was\r\ndevoted.\"\r\n\r\nThe _role_ that Lyell played as a pioneer makes his own point of view as\r\nto evolution all the more remarkable. As the late H. C. Watson wrote to\r\nmy father (December 21, 1859):--\r\n\r\nNow these novel views are brought fairly before the scientific public,\r\nit seems truly remarkable how so many of them could have failed to see\r\ntheir right road sooner. How could Sir C. Lyell, for instance, for\r\nthirty years read, write, and think, on the subject of species _and\r\ntheir succession_, and yet constantly look down the wrong road!\r\n\r\n\"A quarter of a century ago, you and I must have been in something like\r\nthe same state of mind on the main question. But you were able to see\r\nand work out the _quo modo_ of the succession, the all-important thing,\r\nwhile I failed to grasp it.\"\r\n\r\nIn his earlier attitude towards evolution, my father was on a par with\r\nhis contemporaries. He wrote in the _Autobiography_:--\r\n\r\n\"I occasionally sounded not a few naturalists, and never happened to\r\ncome across a single one who seemed to doubt about the permanence of\r\nspecies:\" and it will be made abundantly clear by his letters that in\r\nsupporting the opposite view he felt himself a terrible heretic.\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley[131] writes in the same sense:--\r\n\r\n\"Within the ranks of biologists, at that time [1851-58], I met with\r\nnobody, except Dr. Grant, of University College, who had a word to say\r\nfor Evolution--and his advocacy was not calculated to advance the cause.\r\nOutside these ranks, the only person known to me whose knowledge and\r\ncapacity compelled respect, and who was, at the same time, a\r\nthorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance\r\nI made, I think, in 1852, and then entered into the bonds of a\r\nfriendship which, I am happy to think, has known no interruption. Many\r\nand prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my\r\nfriend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of apt illustration could\r\nnot drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two\r\ngrounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favour of\r\ntransmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion\r\nrespecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made,\r\nwas in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the\r\nstate of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other\r\nconclusion was justifiable.\"\r\n\r\nThese two last citations refer of course to a period much later than the\r\ntime, 1836-37, at which the Darwinian theory was growing in my father's\r\nmind. The same thing is however true of earlier days.\r\n\r\nSo much for the general problem: the further question as to the growth\r\nof Darwin's theory of natural selection is a less complex one, and I\r\nneed add but little to the history given in the _Autobiography_ of how\r\nhe came by that great conception by the help of which he was able to\r\nrevivify \"the oldest of all philosophies--that of evolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe first point in the slow journey towards the _Origin of Species_ was\r\nthe opening of that note-book of 1837 of which mention has been already\r\nmade. The reader who is curious on the subject will find a series of\r\ncitations from this most interesting note-book, in the _Life and\r\nLetters_, vol. ii. p. 5, _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe two following extracts show that he applied the theory of evolution\r\nto the \"whole organic kingdom\" from plants to man.\r\n\r\n\"If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow\r\nbrethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine--our slaves in\r\nthe most laborious works, our companions in our amusements--they may\r\npartake [of] our origin in one common ancestor--we may be all melted\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"The different intellects of man and animals not so great as between\r\nliving things without thought (plants), and living things with thought\r\n(animals).\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of intermediate forms, he remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"Opponents will say--_show them me_. I will answer yes, if you will show\r\nme every step between bulldog and greyhound.\"\r\n\r\nHere we see that the argument from domestic animals was already present\r\nin his mind as bearing on the production of natural species, an argument\r\nwhich he afterwards used with such signal force in the _Origin_.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the two editions of the _Naturalists' Voyage_ is\r\ninstructive, as giving some idea of the development of his views on\r\nevolution. It does not give us a true index of the mass of conjecture\r\nwhich was taking shape in his mind, but it shows us that he felt sure\r\nenough of the truth of his belief to allow a stronger tinge of evolution\r\nto appear in the second edition. He has mentioned in the _Autobiography_\r\n(p. 40), that it was not until he read Malthus that he got a clear view\r\nof the potency of natural selection. This was in 1838--a year after he\r\nfinished the first edition (it was not published until 1839), and seven\r\nyears before the second edition was issued (1845). Thus the\r\nturning-point in the formation of his theory took place between the\r\nwriting of the two editions. Yet the difference between the two editions\r\nis not very marked; it is another proof of the author's caution and\r\nself-restraint in the treatment of his ideas. After reading the second\r\nedition of the _Voyage_ we remember with a strong feeling of surprise\r\nhow far advanced were his views when he wrote it.\r\n\r\nThese views are given in the manuscript volume of 1844, mentioned in the\r\n_Autobiography_. I give from my father's Pocket-book the entries\r\nreferring to the preliminary sketch of this historic essay.\r\n\r\n\"_1842, May 18_,--Went to Maer. _June 15_--to Shrewsbury, and 18th to\r\nCapel Curig. During my stay at Maer and Shrewsbury ... wrote pencil\r\nsketch of species theory.\"[132]\r\n\r\nIn 1844, the pencil-sketch was enlarged to one of 230 folio pages,\r\nwhich is a wonderfully complete presentation of the arguments familiar\r\nto us in the _Origin_.\r\n\r\nThe following letter shows in a striking manner the value my father put\r\non this piece of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Mrs. Darwin._ Down [July 5, 1844].\r\n\r\n... I have just finished my sketch of my species theory. If, as I\r\nbelieve, my theory in time be accepted even by one competent judge, it\r\nwill be a considerable step in science.\r\n\r\nI therefore write this in case of my sudden death, as my most solemn and\r\nlast request, which I am sure you will consider the same as if legally\r\nentered in my will, that you will devote L400 to its publication, and\r\nfurther, will yourself, or through Hensleigh,[133] take trouble in\r\npromoting it. I wish that my sketch be given to some competent person,\r\nwith this sum to induce him to take trouble in its improvement and\r\nenlargement. I give to him all my books on Natural History, which are\r\neither scored or have references at the end to the pages, begging him\r\ncarefully to look over and consider such passages as actually bearing,\r\nor by possibility bearing, on this subject. I wish you to make a list of\r\nall such books as some temptation to an editor. I also request that you\r\nwill hand over [to] him all those scraps roughly divided in eight or ten\r\nbrown paper portfolios. The scraps, with copied quotations from various\r\nworks, are those which may aid my editor. I also request that you, or\r\nsome amanuensis, will aid in deciphering any of the scraps which the\r\neditor may think possibly of use. I leave to the editor's judgment\r\nwhether to interpolate these facts in the text, or as notes, or under\r\nappendices. As the looking over the references and scraps will be a long\r\nlabour, and as the _correcting_ and enlarging and altering my sketch\r\nwill also take considerable time, I leave this sum of L400 as some\r\nremuneration, and any profits from the work, I consider that for this\r\nthe editor is bound to get the sketch published either at a publisher's\r\nor his own risk. Many of the scraps in the portfolios contain mere rude\r\nsuggestions and early views, now useless, and many of the facts will\r\nprobably turn out as having no bearing on my theory.\r\n\r\nWith respect to editors, Mr. Lyell would be the best if he would\r\nundertake it; I believe he would find the work pleasant, and he would\r\nlearn some facts new to him. As the editor must be a geologist as well\r\nas a naturalist, the next best editor would be Professor Forbes of\r\nLondon. The next best (and quite best in many respects) would be\r\nProfessor Henslow. Dr. Hooker would be _very_ good. The next, Mr.\r\nStrickland.[134] If none of these would undertake it, I would request\r\nyou to consult with Mr. Lyell, or some other capable man for some\r\neditor, a geologist and naturalist. Should one other hundred pounds make\r\nthe difference of procuring a good editor, I request earnestly that you\r\nwill raise L500.\r\n\r\nMy remaining collections in Natural History may be given to any one or\r\nany museum where [they] would be accepted....\r\n\r\nThe following note seems to have formed part of the original letter, but\r\nmay have been of later date:\r\n\r\n\"Lyell, especially with the aid of Hooker (and of any good zoological\r\naid), would be best of all. Without an editor will pledge himself to\r\ngive up time to it, it would be of no use paying such a sum.\"\r\n\r\n\"It there should be any difficulty in getting an editor who would go\r\nthoroughly into the subject, and think of the bearing of the passages\r\nmarked in the books and copied out [on?] scraps of paper, then let my\r\nsketch be published as it is, stating that it was done several years\r\nago[135] and from memory without consulting any works, and with no\r\nintention of publication in its present form.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea that the Sketch of 1844 might remain, in the event of his\r\ndeath, as the only record of his work, seems to have been long in his\r\nmind, for in August 1854, when he had finished with the Cirripedes, and\r\nwas thinking of beginning his \"species work,\" he added on the back of\r\nthe above letter, \"Hooker by far best man to edit my species volume.\r\nAugust 1854.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[125] Vol. xliv.

In Mr. Huxley's chapter the\r\npassage beginning \"Lyell with perfect right....\" is given as a footnote:\r\nit will be seen that I have incorporated it with Mr. Huxley's text.\r\n\r\n[130] Lyell's _Life and Letters_, Letter to Haeckel, vol. ii. p. 436.\r\nNov. 23, 1868.\r\n\r\n[131] _Life and Letters_, vol. ii. p. 188.\r\n\r\n[132] I have discussed in the _Life and Letters_ the statement often\r\nmade that the first sketch of his theory was written in 1839.\r\n\r\n[133] The late Mr. H.

It was a period of minute labour on a variety of\r\nsubjects, and the letters accordingly abound in detail. They are in many\r\nways extremely interesting, more especially so to professed naturalists,\r\nand the picture of patient research which they convey is of great value\r\nfrom a biographical point of view. But such a picture must either be\r\ngiven in a complete series of unabridged letters, or omitted altogether.\r\nThe limits of space compel me to the latter choice. The reader must\r\nimagine my father corresponding on problems in geology, geographical\r\ndistribution, and classification; at the same time collecting facts on\r\nsuch varied points as the stripes on horses' legs, the floating of\r\nseeds, the breeding of pigeons, the form of bees' cells and the\r\ninnumerable other questions to which his gigantic task demanded answers.\r\n\r\nThe concluding letter of the last chapter has shown how strong was his\r\nconviction of the value of his work. It is impressive evidence of the\r\ncondition of the scientific atmosphere, to discover, as in the following\r\nletters to Sir Joseph Hooker, how small was the amount of encouragement\r\nthat he dared to hope for from his brother-naturalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n[January 11th, 1844.]\r\n\r\n... I have been now ever since my return engaged in a very presumptuous\r\nwork, and I know no one individual who would not say a very foolish one.\r\nI was so struck with the distribution of the Galapagos organisms, &c.\r\n&c., and with the character of the American fossil mammifers, &c. &c.,\r\nthat I determined to collect blindly every sort of fact, which could\r\nbear any way on what are species. I have read heaps of agricultural and\r\nhorticultural books, and have never ceased collecting facts. At last\r\ngleams of light have come, and I am almost convinced (quite contrary to\r\nthe opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing\r\na murder) immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a\r\n\"tendency to progression,\" \"adaptations from the slow willing of\r\nanimals,\" &c.! But the conclusions I am led to are not widely different\r\nfrom his; though the means of change are wholly so. I think I have found\r\nout (here's presumption!) the simple way by which species become\r\nexquisitely adapted to various ends. You will now groan, and think to\r\nyourself, \"on what a man have I been wasting my time and writing to.\" I\r\nshould, five years ago, have thought so....\r\n\r\nAnd again (1844):--\r\n\r\n\"In my most sanguine moments, all I expect, is that I shall be able to\r\nshow even to sound Naturalists, that there are two sides to the question\r\nof the immutability of species--that facts can be viewed and grouped\r\nunder the notion of allied species having descended from common stocks.\r\nWith respect to books on this subject, I do not know of any systematical\r\nones, except Lamarck's which is veritable rubbish: but there are plenty,\r\nas Lyell, Pritchard, &c., on the view of the immutability. Agassiz\r\nlately has brought the strongest argument in favour of immutability.\r\nIsidore G. St. Hilaire has written some good Essays, tending towards the\r\nmutability-side, in the _Suites a Buffon_, entitled _Zoolog. Generale_.\r\nIs it not strange that the author of such a book as the _Animaux sans\r\nVertebres_ should have written that insects, which never see their eggs,\r\nshould will (and plants, their seeds) to be of particular forms, so as\r\nto become attached to particular objects. The other common (specially\r\nGermanic) notion is hardly less absurd, viz. that climate, food, &c.,\r\nshould make a Pediculus formed to climb hair, or a wood-pecker to climb\r\ntrees. I believe all these absurd views arise from no one having, as far\r\nas I know, approached the subject on the side of variation under\r\ndomestication, and having studied all that is known about\r\ndomestication.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate arguments from results, but on my views of descent, really\r\nNatural History becomes a sublimely grand result-giving subject (now you\r\nmay quiz me for so foolish an escape of mouth)....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to L. Jenyns_[136] Down Oct. 12th [1845].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JENYNS--Thanks for your note. I am sorry to say I have not even\r\nthe tail-end of a fact in English Zoology to communicate. I have found\r\nthat even trifling observations require, in my case, some leisure and\r\nenergy, [of] both of which ingredients I have had none to spare, as\r\nwriting my Geology thoroughly expends both. I had always thought that I\r\nwould keep a journal and record everything, but in the way I now live I\r\nfind I observe nothing to record. Looking after my garden and trees, and\r\noccasionally a very little walk in an idle frame of my mind, fill up\r\nevery afternoon in the same manner. I am surprised that with all your\r\nparish affairs, you have had time to do all that which you have done. I\r\nshall be very glad to see your little work[137] (and proud should I have\r\nbeen if I could have added a single fact to it). My work on the species\r\nquestion has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such\r\nworks as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally\r\nto call trifling facts. These are the facts which make one understand\r\nthe working or economy of nature. There is one subject, on which I am\r\nvery curious, and which perhaps you may throw some light on, if you have\r\never thought on it; namely, what are the checks and what the periods of\r\nlife--by which the increase of any given species is limited. Just\r\ncalculate the increase of any bird, if you assume that only half the\r\nyoung are reared, and these breed: within the _natural_ (i.e. if free\r\nfrom accidents) life of the parents the number of individuals will\r\nbecome enormous, and I have been much surprised to think how great\r\ndestruction _must_ annually or occasionally be falling on every species,\r\nyet the means and period of such destruction are scarcely perceived by\r\nus.\r\n\r\nI have continued steadily reading and collecting facts on variation of\r\ndomestic animals and plants, and on the question of what are species. I\r\nhave a grand body of facts, and I think I can draw some sound\r\nconclusions. The general conclusions at which I have slowly been driven\r\nfrom a directly opposite conviction, is that species are mutable, and\r\nthat allied species are co-descendants from common stocks. I know how\r\nmuch I open myself to reproach for such a conclusion, but I have at\r\nleast honestly and deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this\r\nsubject for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. Darwin to L. Jenyns._[138] Down [1845?].\r\n\r\nWith respect to my far distant work on species, I must have expressed\r\nmyself with singular inaccuracy if I led you to suppose that I meant to\r\nsay that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after\r\nyears of weighing puzzles, to myself _alone_; but in my wildest\r\nday-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are\r\ntwo sides to the question of the immutability of species, i.e. whether\r\nspecies are _directly_ created or by intermediate laws (as with the life\r\nand death of individuals). I did not approach the subject on the side of\r\nthe difficulty in determining what are species and what are varieties,\r\nbut (though why I should give you such a history of my doings it would\r\nbe hard to say) from such facts as the relationship between the living\r\nand extinct mammifers in South America, and between those living on the\r\nContinent and on adjoining islands, such as the Galapagos. It occurred\r\nto me that a collection of all such analogous facts would throw light\r\neither for or against the view of related species being co-descendants\r\nfrom a common stock. A long searching amongst agricultural and\r\nhorticultural books and people makes me believe (I well know how\r\nabsurdly presumptuous this must appear) that I see the way in which new\r\nvarieties become exquisitely adapted to the external conditions of life\r\nand to other surrounding beings. I am a bold man to lay myself open to\r\nbeing thought a complete fool, and a most deliberate one. From the\r\nnature of the grounds which make me believe that species are mutable in\r\nform, these grounds cannot be restricted to the closest-allied species;\r\nbut how far they extend I cannot tell, as my reasons fall away by\r\ndegrees, when applied to species more and more remote from each other.\r\nPray do not think that I am so blind as not to see that there are\r\nnumerous immense difficulties in my notions, but they appear to me less\r\nthan on the common view. I have drawn up a sketch and had it copied (in\r\n200 pages) of my conclusions; and if I thought at some future time that\r\nyou would think it worth reading, I should, of course, be most thankful\r\nto have the criticism of so competent a critic. Excuse this very long\r\nand egotistical and ill-written letter, which by your remarks you have\r\nled me into.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down [1849-50?].\r\n\r\n... How painfully (to me) true is your remark, that no one has hardly a\r\nright to examine the question of species who has not minutely described\r\nmany. I was, however, pleased to hear from Owen (who is vehemently\r\nopposed to any mutability in species), that he thought it was a very\r\nfair subject, and that there was a mass of facts to be brought to bear\r\non the question, not hitherto collected. My only comfort is (as I mean\r\nto attempt the subject), that I have dabbled in several branches of\r\nNatural History, and seen good specific men work out my species, and\r\nknow something of geology (an indispensable union); and though I shall\r\nget more kicks than half-pennies, I will, life serving, attempt my work.\r\nLamarck is the only exception, that I can think of, of an accurate\r\ndescriber of species at least in the Invertebrate Kingdom, who has\r\ndisbelieved in permanent species, but he in his absurd though clever\r\nwork has done the subject harm, as has Mr. Vestiges, and, as (some\r\nfuture loose naturalist attempting the same speculations will perhaps\r\nsay) has Mr. D....\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ September 25th [1853].\r\n\r\nIn my own Cirripedial work (by the way, thank you for the dose of soft\r\nsolder; it does one--or at least me--a great deal of good)--in my own\r\nwork I have not felt conscious that disbelieving in the mere\r\n_permanence_ of species has made much difference one way or the other;\r\nin some few cases (if publishing avowedly on the doctrine of\r\nnon-permanence), I should _not_ have affixed names, and in some few\r\ncases should have affixed names to remarkable varieties. Certainly I\r\nhave felt it humiliating, discussing and doubting, and examining over\r\nand over again, when in my own mind the only doubt has been whether the\r\nform varied _to-day or yesterday_ (not to put too fine a point on it, as\r\nSnagsby[139] would say). After describing a set of forms as distinct\r\nspecies, tearing up my MS., and making them one species, tearing that up\r\nand making them separate, and then making them one again (which has\r\nhappened to me), I have gnashed my teeth, cursed species, and asked what\r\nsin I had committed to be so punished. But I must confess that perhaps\r\nnearly the same thing would have happened to me on any scheme of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down, March 26th [1854].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER--I had hoped that you would have had a little\r\nbreathing-time after your Journal,[140] but this seems to be very far\r\nfrom the case; and I am the more obliged (and somewhat contrite) for the\r\nlong letter received this morning, _most_ juicy with news and _most_\r\ninteresting to me in many ways. I am very glad indeed to hear of the\r\nreforms, &c., in the Royal Society. With respect to the Club,[141] I am\r\ndeeply interested; only two or three days ago, I was regretting to my\r\nwife, how I was letting drop and being dropped by nearly all my\r\nacquaintances, and that I would endeavour to go oftener to London; I was\r\nnot then thinking of the Club, which, as far as one thing goes, would\r\nanswer my exact object in keeping up old and making some new\r\nacquaintances. I will therefore come up to London for every (with rare\r\nexceptions) Club-day, and then my head, I think, will allow me on an\r\naverage to go to every other meeting. But it is grievous how often any\r\nchange knocks me up. I will further pledge myself, as I told Lyell, to\r\nresign after a year, if I did not attend pretty often, so that I should\r\n_at worst_ encumber the Club temporarily. If you can get me elected, I\r\ncertainly shall be very much pleased.... I am particularly obliged to\r\nyou for sending me Asa Gray's letter; how very pleasantly he writes. To\r\nsee his and your caution on the species-question ought to overwhelm me\r\nin confusion and shame; it does make me feel deuced uncomfortable.... I\r\nwas pleased and surprised to see A. Gray's remarks on crossing\r\nobliterating varieties, on which, as you know, I have been collecting\r\nfacts for these dozen years. How awfully flat I shall feel, if, when I\r\ngot my notes together on species, &c. &c., the whole thing explodes like\r\nan empty puff-ball. Do not work yourself to death.\r\n\r\nEver yours most truly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo work out the problem of the Geographical Distribution of animals and\r\nplants on evolutionary principles, Darwin had to study the means by\r\nwhich seeds, eggs, &c., can be transported across wide spaces of ocean.\r\nIt was this need which gave an interest to the class of experiment to\r\nwhich the following letters refer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ April 13th [1855].\r\n\r\n... I have had one experiment some little time in progress which will, I\r\nthink, be interesting, namely, seeds in salt water, immersed in water of\r\n32-33 deg., which I have and shall long have, as I filled a great tank\r\nwith snow. When I wrote last I was going to triumph over you, for my\r\nexperiment had in a slight degree succeeded; but this, with infinite\r\nbaseness, I did not tell, in hopes that you would say that you would eat\r\nall the plants which I could raise after immersion. It is very\r\naggravating that I cannot in the least remember what you did formerly\r\nsay that made me think you scoffed at the experiments vastly; for you\r\nnow seem to view the experiment like a good Christian. I have in small\r\nbottles out of doors, exposed to variation of temperature, cress,\r\nradish, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, and celery, and onion seed. These,\r\nafter immersion for exactly one week, have all germinated, which I did\r\nnot in the least expect (and thought how you would sneer at me); for the\r\nwater of nearly all, and of the cress especially, smelt very badly, and\r\nthe cress seed emitted a wonderful quantity of mucus (the\r\n_Vestiges_[142] would have expected them to turn into tadpoles), so as\r\nto adhere in a mass; but these seeds germinated and grew splendidly. The\r\ngermination of all (especially cress and lettuces) has been accelerated,\r\nexcept the cabbages, which have come up very irregularly, and a good\r\nmany, I think, dead. One would, have thought, from their native habitat,\r\nthat the cabbage would have stood well. The Umbelliferae and onions seem\r\nto stand the salt well. I wash the seed before planting them. I have\r\nwritten to the _Gardeners' Chronicle_,[143] though I doubt whether it\r\nwas worth while. If my success seems to make it worth while, I will send\r\na seed list, to get you to mark some different classes of seeds. To-day\r\nI replant the same seeds as above after fourteen days' immersion. As\r\nmany sea-currents go a mile an hour, even in a week they might be\r\ntransported 168 miles; the Gulf Stream is said to go fifty and sixty\r\nmiles a day. So much and too much on this head; but my geese are always\r\nswans....\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ [April 14th, 1855.]\r\n\r\n... You are a good man to confess that you expected the cress would be\r\nkilled in a week, for this gives me a nice little triumph. The children\r\nat first were tremendously eager, and asked me often, \"whether I should\r\nbeat Dr. Hooker!\" The cress and lettuce have just vegetated well after\r\ntwenty-one days' immersion. But I will write no more, which is a great\r\nvirtue in me; for it is to me a very great pleasure telling you\r\neverything I do.\r\n\r\n... If you knew some of the experiments (if they may be so called) which\r\nI am trying, you would have a good right to sneer, for they are so\r\n_absurd_ even in _my_ opinion that I dare not tell you.\r\n\r\nHave not some men a nice notion of experimentising? I have had a letter\r\ntelling me that seeds _must_ have _great_ power of resisting salt water,\r\nfor otherwise how could they get to islands'? This is the true way to\r\nsolve a problem?\r\n\r\nExperiments on the transportal of seeds through the agency of animals,\r\nalso gave him much labour. He wrote to Fox (1855):--\r\n\r\n\"All nature is perverse and will not do as I wish it; and just at\r\npresent I wish I had my old barnacles to work at, and nothing new.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"Everything has been going wrong with me lately: the fish at the Zoolog.\r\nSoc. ate up lots of soaked seeds, and in imagination they had in my mind\r\nbeen swallowed, fish and all, by a heron, had been carried a hundred\r\nmiles, been voided on the banks of some other lake and germinated\r\nsplendidly, when lo and behold, the fish ejected vehemently, and with\r\ndisgust equal to my own, _all_ the seeds from their mouths.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNFINISHED BOOK.\r\n\r\nIn his Autobiographical sketch (p. 41) my father wrote:--\"Early in 1856\r\nLyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and I began at once\r\nto do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as that which was\r\nafterwards followed in my _Origin of Species_; yet it was only an\r\nabstract of the materials which I had collected.\" The remainder of the\r\npresent chapter is chiefly concerned with the preparation of this\r\nunfinished book.\r\n\r\nThe work was begun on May 14th, and steadily continued up to June 1858,\r\nwhen it was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Wallace's MS. During the\r\ntwo years which we are now considering, he wrote ten chapters (that is\r\nabout one-half) of the projected book.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker_. May 9th [1856].\r\n\r\n... I very much want advice and _truthful_ consolation if you can give\r\nit. I had a good talk with Lyell about my species work, and he urges me\r\nstrongly to publish something. I am fixed against any periodical or\r\nJournal, as I positively will _not_ expose myself to an Editor or a\r\nCouncil allowing a publication for which they might be abused. If I\r\npublish anything it must be a _very thin_ and little volume, giving a\r\nsketch of my views and difficulties; but it is really dreadfully\r\nunphilosophical to give a _resume_, without exact references, of an\r\nunpublished work. But Lyell seemed to think I might do this, at the\r\nsuggestion of friends, and on the ground, which I I might state, that I\r\nhad been at work for eighteen[144] years, and yet could not publish for\r\nseveral years, and especially as I could point out difficulties which\r\nseemed to me to require especial investigation. Now what think you? I\r\nshould be really grateful for advice. I thought of giving up a couple of\r\nmonths and writing such a sketch, and trying to keep my judgment open\r\nwhether or no to publish it when completed. It will be simply impossible\r\nfor me to give exact references; anything important I should state on\r\nthe authority of the author generally; and instead of giving all the\r\nfacts on which I ground my opinion, I could give by memory only one or\r\ntwo. In the Preface I would state that the work could not be considered\r\nstrictly scientific, but a mere sketch or outline of a future work in\r\nwhich full references, &c., should be given. Eheu, eheu, I believe I\r\nshould sneer at any one else doing this, and my only comfort is, that I\r\n_truly_ never dreamed of it, till Lyell suggested it, and seems\r\ndeliberately to think it advisable.\r\n\r\nI am in a peck of troubles, and do pray forgive me for troubling you.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made an attempt at a sketch of his views, but as he wrote to Fox in\r\nOctober 1856:--\r\n\r\n\"I found it such unsatisfactory work that I have desisted, and am now\r\ndrawing up my work as perfect as my materials of nineteen years'\r\ncollecting suffice, but do not intend to stop to perfect any line of\r\ninvestigation beyond current work.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in November he wrote to Sir Charles Lyell:--\r\n\r\n\"I am working very steadily at my big book; I have found it quite\r\nimpossible to publish any preliminary essay or sketch; but am doing my\r\nwork as completely as my present materials allow without waiting to\r\nperfect them. And this much acceleration I owe to you.\"\r\n\r\nAgain to Mr. Fox, in February, 1857:--\r\n\r\n\"I am got most deeply interested in my subject; though I wish I could\r\nset less value on the bauble fame, either present or posthumous, than I\r\ndo, but not I think, to any extreme degree: yet, if I know myself, I\r\nwould work just as hard, though with less gusto, if I knew that my book\r\nwould be published for ever anonymously.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to A. R. Wallace._ Moor Park, May 1st, 1857.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR--I am much obliged for your letter of October 10th, from\r\nCelebes, received a few days ago; in a laborious undertaking, sympathy\r\nis a valuable and real encouragement. By your letter and even still more\r\nby your paper[145] in the Annals, a year or more ago, I can plainly see\r\nthat we have thought much alike and to a certain extent have come to\r\nsimilar conclusions. In regard to the Paper in the Annals, I agree to\r\nthe truth of almost every word of your paper; and I dare say that you\r\nwill agree with me that it is very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty\r\nclosely with any theoretical paper; for it is lamentable how each man\r\ndraws his own different conclusions from the very same facts. This\r\nsummer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first note-book, on\r\nthe question how and in what way do species and varieties differ from\r\neach other. I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the\r\nsubject so very large, that though I have written many chapters, I do\r\nnot suppose I shall go to press for two years. I have never heard how\r\nlong you intend staying in the Malay Archipelago; I wish I might profit\r\nby the publication of your Travels there before my work appears, for no\r\ndoubt you will reap a large harvest of facts. I have acted already in\r\naccordance with your advice of keeping domestic varieties, and those\r\nappearing in a state of nature, distinct; but I have sometimes doubted\r\nof the wisdom of this, and therefore I am glad to be backed by your\r\nopinion. I must confess, however, I rather doubt the truth of the now\r\nvery prevalent doctrine of all our domestic animals having descended\r\nfrom several wild stocks; though I do not doubt that it is so in some\r\ncases. I think there is rather better evidence on the sterility of\r\nhybrid animals than you seem to admit: and in regard to plants the\r\ncollection of carefully recorded facts by Koelreuter and Gaertner (and\r\nHerbert) is _enormous_. I most entirely agree with you on the little\r\neffects of \"climatal conditions,\" which one sees referred to _ad\r\nnauseam_ in all books: I suppose some very little effect must be\r\nattributed to such influences, but I fully believe that they are very\r\nslight. It is really _impossible_ to explain my views (in the compass of\r\na letter), on the causes and means of variation in a state of nature;\r\nbut I have slowly adopted a distinct and tangible idea,--whether true or\r\nfalse others must judge; for the firmest conviction of the truth of a\r\ndoctrine by its author, seems, alas, not to be the slightest guarantee\r\nof truth!...\r\n\r\nIn December 1857 he wrote to the same correspondent:--\r\n\r\n\"You ask whether I shall discuss 'man.' I think I shall avoid the whole\r\nsubject, as so surrounded with prejudices; though I fully admit that it\r\nis the highest and most interesting problem for the naturalist. My work,\r\non which I have now been at work more or less for twenty years, will not\r\nfix or settle anything; but I hope it will aid by giving a large\r\ncollection of facts, with one definite end. I get on very slowly, partly\r\nfrom ill-health, partly from being a very slow worker. I have got about\r\nhalf written; but I do not suppose I shall publish under a couple of\r\nyears. I have now been three whole months on one chapter on Hybridism!\r\n\r\n\"I am astonished to see that you expect to remain out three or four\r\nyears more. What a wonderful deal you will have seen, and what\r\ninteresting areas--the grand Malay Archipelago and the richest parts of\r\nSouth America! I infinitely admire and honour your zeal and courage in\r\nthe good cause of Natural Science; and you have my very sincere and\r\ncordial good wishes for success of all kinds, and may all your theories\r\nsucceed, except that on Oceanic Islands, on which subject I will do\r\nbattle to the death.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Fox in February 1858:--\r\n\r\n\"I am working very hard at my book, perhaps too hard. It will be very\r\nbig, and I am become most deeply interested in the way facts fall into\r\ngroups. I am like Croesus overwhelmed with my riches in facts, and I\r\nmean to make my book as perfect as ever I can. I shall not go to press\r\nat soonest for a couple of years.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter which follows, written from his favourite resting place, the\r\nWater-Cure Establishment at Moor Park, comes in like a lull before the\r\nstorm,--the upset of all his plans by the arrival of Mr. Wallace's\r\nmanuscript, a phase in the history of his life to which the next chapter\r\nis devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Mrs. Darwin._ Moor Park, April [1858].\r\n\r\nThe weather is quite delicious. Yesterday, after writing to you, I\r\nstrolled a little beyond the glade for an hour and a half, and enjoyed\r\nmyself--the fresh yet dark green of the grand Scotch firs, the brown of\r\nthe catkins of the old birches, with their white stems, and a fringe of\r\ndistant green from the larches, made an excessively pretty view. At last\r\nI fell fast asleep on the grass, and awoke with a chorus of birds\r\nsinging around me, and squirrels running up the trees, and some\r\nwoodpeckers laughing, and it was as pleasant and rural a scene as ever I\r\nsaw, and I did not care one penny how any of the beasts or birds had\r\nbeen formed. I sat in the drawing-room till after eight, and then went\r\nand read the Chief Justice's summing up, and thought Bernard[146]\r\nguilty, and then read a bit of my novel, which is feminine, virtuous,\r\nclerical, philanthropical, and all that sort of thing, but very\r\ndecidedly flat. I say feminine, for the author is ignorant about money\r\nmatters, and not much of a lady--for she makes her men say, \"My Lady.\" I\r\nlike Miss Craik very much, though we have some battles, and differ on\r\nevery subject. I like also the Hungarian; a thorough gentleman, formerly\r\nattache at Paris, and then in the Austrian cavalry, and now a pardoned\r\nexile, with broken health. He does not seem to like Kossuth, but says,\r\nhe is certain [he is] a sincere patriot, most clever and eloquent, but\r\nweak, with no determination of character....\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] Rev.

Lyell._ Down, 18th [June 1858].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL--Some year or so ago you recommended me to read a paper by\r\nWallace in the _Annals_,[147] which had interested you, and as I was\r\nwriting to him, I knew this would please him much, so I told him. He has\r\nto-day sent me the enclosed, and asked me to forward it to you. It seems\r\nto me well worth reading. Your words have come true with a\r\nvengeance--that I should be forestalled. You said this, when I explained\r\nto you here very briefly my views of 'Natural Selection' depending on\r\nthe struggle for existence. I never saw a more striking coincidence; if\r\nWallace had my MS. sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a\r\nbetter short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters.\r\nPlease return me the MS., which he does not say he wishes me to publish,\r\nbut I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\r\nSo all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed,\r\nthough my book, if it will ever have any value, will not be\r\ndeteriorated; as all the labour consists in the application of the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nI hope you will approve of Wallace's sketch, that I may tell him what\r\nyou say.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, yours most truly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down, [June 25, 1858].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL--I am very sorry to trouble you, busy as you are, in so\r\nmerely personal an affair; but if you will give me your deliberate\r\nopinion, you will do me as great a service as ever man did, for I have\r\nentire confidence in your judgment and honour....\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in Wallace's sketch which is not written out much\r\nfuller in my sketch, copied out in 1844, and read by Hooker some dozen\r\nyears ago. About a year ago I sent a short sketch, of which I have a\r\ncopy, of my views (owing to correspondence on several points) to Asa\r\nGray, so that I could most truly say and prove that I take nothing from\r\nWallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my\r\ngeneral views in about a dozen pages or so; but I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat I can do so honourably. Wallace says nothing about publication, and\r\nI enclose his letter. But as I had not intended to publish any sketch,\r\ncan I do so honourably, because Wallace has sent me an outline of his\r\ndoctrine? I would far rather burn my whole book, than that he or any\r\nother man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit. Do you not\r\nthink his having sent me this sketch ties my hands?... If I could\r\nhonourably publish, I would state that I was induced now to publish a\r\nsketch (and I should be very glad to be permitted to say, to follow your\r\nadvice long ago given) from Wallace having sent me an outline of my\r\ngeneral conclusions. We differ only, [in] that I was led to my views\r\nfrom what artificial selection has done for domestic animals. I would\r\nsend Wallace a copy of my letter to Asa Gray, to show him that I had not\r\nstolen his doctrine. But I cannot tell whether to publish now would not\r\nbe base and paltry. This was my first impression, and I should have\r\ncertainly acted on it had it not been for your letter.\r\n\r\nThis is a trumpery affair to trouble you with, but you cannot tell how\r\nmuch obliged I should be for your advice.\r\n\r\nBy the way, would you object to send this and your answer to Hooker to\r\nbe forwarded to me? for then I shall have the opinion of my two best and\r\nkindest friends. This letter is miserably written, and I write it now,\r\nthat I may for a time banish the whole subject; and I am worn out with\r\nmusing....\r\n\r\nMy good dear friend, forgive me. This is a trumpery letter, influenced\r\nby trumpery feelings.\r\n\r\nYours most truly.\r\n\r\nI will never trouble you or Hooker on the subject again.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down, 26th [June 1858].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL--Forgive me for adding a P.S. to make the case as strong\r\nas possible against myself.\r\n\r\nWallace might say, \"You did not intend publishing an abstract of your\r\nviews till you received my communication. Is it fair to take advantage\r\nof my having freely, though unasked, communicated to you my ideas, and\r\nthus prevent me forestalling you?\" The advantage which I should take\r\nbeing that I am induced to publish from privately knowing that Wallace\r\nis in the field. It seems hard on me that I should be thus compelled to\r\nlose my priority of many years' standing, but I cannot feel at all sure\r\nthat this alters the justice of the case. First impressions are\r\ngenerally right, and I at first thought it would be dishonourable in me\r\nnow to publish.\r\n\r\nYours most truly.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have always thought you would make a first-rate Lord Chancellor;\r\nand I now appeal to you as a Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Tuesday night [June 29, 1858].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER--I have just read your letter, and see you want the\r\npapers at once. I am quite prostrated,[148] and can do nothing, but I\r\nsend Wallace, and the abstract[149] of my letter to Asa Gray, which\r\ngives most imperfectly only the means of change, and does not touch on\r\nreasons for believing that species do change. I dare say all is too\r\nlate. I hardly care about it. But you are too generous to sacrifice so\r\nmuch time and kindness. It is most generous, most kind. I send my sketch\r\nof 1844 solely that you may see by your own handwriting that you did\r\nread it. I really cannot bear to look at it. Do not waste much time. It\r\nis miserable in me to care at all about priority.\r\n\r\nThe table of contents will show what it is.\r\n\r\nI would make a similar, but shorter and more accurate sketch for the\r\n_Linnean Journal_.\r\n\r\nI will do anything. God bless you, my dear kind friend.\r\n\r\nI can write no more. I send this by my servant to Kew.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe joint paper[150] of Mr. Wallace and my father was read at the\r\nLinnean Society on the evening of July 1st. Mr. Wallace's Essay bore\r\nthe title, \"On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the\r\nOriginal Type.\"\r\n\r\nMy father's contribution to the paper consisted of (1) Extracts from the\r\nsketch of 1844; (2) part of a letter, addressed to Dr. Asa Gray, dated\r\nSeptember 5, 1857. The paper was \"communicated\" to the Society by Sir\r\nCharles Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker, in whose prefatory letter a clear\r\naccount of the circumstances of the case is given.\r\n\r\nReferring to Mr. Wallace's Essay, they wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of the views therein set\r\nforth, that he proposed, in a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, to obtain Mr.\r\nWallace's consent to allow the Essay to be published as soon as\r\npossible. Of this step we highly approved, provided Mr. Darwin did not\r\nwithhold from the public, as he was strongly inclined to do (in favour\r\nof Mr. Wallace), the memoir which he had himself written on the same\r\nsubject, and which, as before stated, one of us had perused in 1844, and\r\nthe contents of which we had both of us been privy to for many years. On\r\nrepresenting this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us permission to make what use\r\nwe thought proper of his memoir, &c.; and in adopting our present\r\ncourse, of presenting it to the Linnean Society, we have explained to\r\nhim that we are not solely considering the relative claims to priority\r\nof himself and his friend, but the interests of science generally.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell and Sir J. D. Hooker were present at the reading of\r\nthe paper, and both, I believe, made a few remarks, chiefly with a view\r\nof impressing on those present the necessity of giving the most careful\r\nconsideration to what they had heard. There was, however, no semblance\r\nof a discussion. Sir Joseph Hooker writes to me: \"The interest excited\r\nwas intense, but the subject was too novel and too ominous for the old\r\nschool to enter the lists, before armouring. After the meeting it was\r\ntalked over with bated breath: Lyell's approval and perhaps in a small\r\nway mine, as his lieutenant in the affair, rather overawed the Fellows,\r\nwho would otherwise have flown out against the doctrine. We had, too,\r\nthe vantage ground of being familiar with the authors and their theme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace has, at my request, been so good as to allow me to publish\r\nthe following letter. Professor Newton, to whom the letter is addressed,\r\nhad submitted to Mr. Wallace his recollections of what the latter had\r\nrelated to him many years before, and had asked Mr. Wallace for a fuller\r\nversion of the story. Hence the few corrections in Mr. Wallace's\r\nletter, for instance _bed_ for _hammock_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. R. Wallace to A. Newton._ Frith Hill, Godalming, Dec. 3rd, 1887.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR NEWTON--I had hardly heard of Darwin before going to the East,\r\nexcept as connected with the voyage of the _Beagle_, which I _think_ I\r\nhad read. I saw him _once_ for a few minutes in the British Museum\r\nbefore I sailed. Through Stevens, my agent, I heard that he wanted\r\ncurious _varieties_ which he was studying. I _think_ I wrote to him\r\nabout some varieties of ducks I had sent, and he must have written once\r\nto me. I find on looking at his \"Life\" that his _first_ letter to me is\r\ngiven in vol. ii. p. 95, and another at p. 109, both after the\r\npublication of my first paper. I must have heard from some notices in\r\nthe _Athenaeum_, I think (which I had sent me), that he was studying\r\nvarieties and species, and as I was continually thinking of the subject,\r\nI wrote to him giving some of my notions, and making some suggestions.\r\nBut at that time I had not the remotest notion that he had already\r\narrived at a definite theory--still less that it was the same as\r\noccurred to me, suddenly, in Ternate in 1858. The most interesting\r\ncoincidence in the matter, I think, is, that I, _as well as Darwin_, was\r\nled to the theory itself through Malthus--in my case it was his\r\nelaborate account of the action of \"preventive checks\" in keeping down\r\nthe population of savage races to a tolerably fixed, but scanty number.\r\nThis had strongly impressed me, and it suddenly flashed upon me that all\r\nanimals are necessarily thus kept down--\"the struggle for\r\nexistence\"--while _variations_, on which I was always thinking, must\r\nnecessarily often be _beneficial_, and would then cause those varieties\r\nto increase while the injurious variations diminished.[151] You are\r\nquite at liberty to mention the circumstances, but I think you have\r\ncoloured them a little highly, and introduced some slight errors. I was\r\nlying on my bed (no hammocks in the East) in the hot fit of intermittent\r\nfever, when the idea suddenly came to me. I thought it almost all out\r\nbefore the fit was over, and the moment I got up began to write it\r\ndown, and I believe finished the first draft the next day.\r\n\r\nI had no idea whatever of \"dying,\"--as it was not a serious\r\nillness,--but I _had_ the idea of working it out, so far as I was able,\r\nwhen I returned home, not at all expecting that Darwin had so long\r\nanticipated me. I can truly say _now_, as I said many years ago, that I\r\nam glad it was so; for I have not the love of _work_, _experiment_ and\r\n_detail_ that was so pre-eminent in Darwin, and without which anything I\r\ncould have written would never have convinced the world. If you do refer\r\nto me at any length, can you send me a proof and I will return it to you\r\nat once?\r\n\r\nYours faithfully\r\nALFRED R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Miss Wedgwood's, Hartfield, Tunbridge Wells\r\n[July 13th, 1858].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER--Your letter to Wallace seems to me perfect, quite clear\r\nand most courteous. I do not think it could possibly be improved, and I\r\nhave to-day forwarded it with a letter of my own. I always thought it\r\nvery possible that I might be forestalled, but I fancied that I had a\r\ngrand enough soul not to care; but I found myself mistaken, and\r\npunished; I had, however, quite resigned myself, and had written half a\r\nletter to Wallace to give up all priority to him, and should certainly\r\nnot have changed had it not been for Lyell's and your quite\r\nextraordinary kindness. I assure you I feel it, and shall not forget it.\r\nI am _more_ than satisfied at what took place at the Linnean Society. I\r\nhad thought that your letter and mine to Asa Gray were to be only an\r\nappendix to Wallace's paper.\r\n\r\nWe go from here in a few days to the sea-side, probably to the Isle of\r\nWight, and on my return (after a battle with pigeon skeletons) I will\r\nset to work at the abstract, though how on earth I shall make anything\r\nof an abstract in thirty pages of the Journal, I know not, but will try\r\nmy best....\r\n\r\nI must try and see you before your journey; but do not think I am\r\nfishing to ask you to come to Down, for you will have no time for that.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine how pleased I am that the notion of Natural Selection\r\nhas acted as a purgative on your bowels of immutability. Whenever\r\nnaturalists can look at species changing as certain, what a magnificent\r\nfield will be open,--on all the laws of variation,--on the genealogy of\r\nall living beings,--on their lines of migration, &c. &c. Pray thank Mrs.\r\nHooker for her very kind little note, and pray say how truly obliged I\r\nam, and in truth ashamed to think that she should have had the trouble\r\nof copying my ugly MS. It was extraordinarily kind in her. Farewell, my\r\ndear kind friend.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have had some fun here in watching a slave-making ant; for I\r\ncould not help rather doubting the wonderful stories, but I have now\r\nseen a defeated marauding party, and I have seen a migration from one\r\nnest to another of the slave-makers, carrying their slaves (who are\r\n_house_, and not field niggers) in their mouths!\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ King's Head Hotel, Sandown, Isle of Wight. July\r\n18th [1858].\r\n\r\n... We are established here for ten days, and then go on to Shanklin,\r\nwhich seems more amusing to one, like myself, who cannot walk. We hope\r\nmuch that the sea may do H. and L. good. And if it does, our expedition\r\nwill answer, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have never half thanked you for all the extraordinary trouble and\r\nkindness you showed me about Wallace's affair. Hooker told me what was\r\ndone at the Linnean Society, and I am far more than satisfied, and I do\r\nnot think that Wallace can think my conduct unfair in allowing you and\r\nHooker to do whatever you thought fair. I certainly was a little annoyed\r\nto lose all priority, but had resigned myself to my fate. I am going to\r\nprepare a longer abstract; but it is really impossible to do justice to\r\nthe subject, except by giving the facts on which each conclusion is\r\ngrounded, and that will, of course, be absolutely impossible. Your name\r\nand Hooker's name appearing as in any way the least interested in my\r\nwork will, I am certain, have the most important bearing in leading\r\npeople to consider the subject without prejudice. I look at this as so\r\nvery important, that I am almost glad of Wallace's paper for having led\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, yours most gratefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to the proof-sheets of the Linnean paper.\r\nThe 'introduction' means the prefatory letter signed by Sir C. Lyell and\r\nSir J. D. Hooker.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ King's Head Hotel, Sandown, Isle of Wight.\r\nJuly 21st [1858].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER--I received only yesterday the proof-sheets, which I now\r\nreturn. I think your introduction cannot be improved.\r\n\r\nI am disgusted with my bad writing. I could not improve it, without\r\nrewriting all, which would not be fair or worth while, as I have begun\r\non a better abstract for the Linnean Society. My excuse is that it\r\n_never_ was intended for publication. I have made only a few corrections\r\nin the style; but I cannot make it decent, but I hope moderately\r\nintelligible. I suppose some one will correct the revise. (Shall I?)\r\n\r\nCould I have a clean proof to send to Wallace?\r\n\r\nI have not yet fully considered your remarks on big genera (but your\r\ngeneral concurrence is of the _highest possible_ interest to me); nor\r\nshall I be able till I re-read my MS.; but you may rely on it that you\r\nnever make a remark to me which is lost from _inattention_. I am\r\nparticularly glad you do not object to my stating your objections in a\r\nmodified form, for they always struck me as very important, and as\r\nhaving much inherent value, whether or no they were fatal to my notions.\r\nI will consider and reconsider all your remarks....\r\n\r\nI am very glad at what you say about my Abstract, but you may rely on it\r\nthat I will condense to the utmost. I would aid in money if it is too\r\nlong.[152] In how many ways you have aided me!\r\n\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Abstract\" mentioned in the last sentence of the preceding letter\r\nwas in fact the _Origin of Species_, on which he now set to work. In his\r\n_Autobiography_ (p. 41) he speaks of beginning to write in September,\r\nbut in his Diary he wrote, \"July 20 to Aug. 12, at Sandown, began\r\nAbstract of Species book.\" \"Sep. 16, Recommenced Abstract.\" The book was\r\nbegun with the idea that it would be published as a paper, or series of\r\npapers, by the Linnean Society, and it was only in the late autumn that\r\nit became clear that it must take the form of an independent volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Norfolk House, Shanklin, Isle of Wight.\r\n[August 1858.]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--I write merely to say that the MS. came safely two or\r\nthree days ago. I am much obliged for the correction of style: I find it\r\nunutterably difficult to write clearly. When we meet I must talk over a\r\nfew points on the subject.\r\n\r\nYou speak of going to the sea-side somewhere; we think this the nicest\r\nsea-side place which we have ever seen, and we like Shanklin better than\r\nother spots on the south coast of the island, though many are charming\r\nand prettier, so that I would suggest your thinking of this place. We\r\nare on the actual coast; but tastes differ so much about places.\r\n\r\nIf you go to Broadstairs, when there is a strong wind from the coast of\r\nFrance and in fine, dry, warm weather, look out and you will _probably_\r\n(!) see thistle-seeds blown across the Channel. The other day I saw one\r\nblown right inland, and then in a few minutes a second one and then a\r\nthird; and I said to myself, God bless me, how many thistles there must\r\nbe in France; and I wrote a letter in imagination to you. But I then\r\nlooked at the _low_ clouds, and noticed that they were not coming\r\ninland, so I feared a screw was loose, I then walked beyond a headland\r\nand found the wind parallel to the coast, and on this very headland a\r\nnoble bed of thistles, which by every wide eddy were blown far out to\r\nsea, and then came right in at right angles to the shore! One day such a\r\nnumber of insects were washed up by the tide, and I brought to life\r\nthirteen species of Coleoptera; not that I suppose these came from\r\nFrance. But do you watch for thistle-seed as you saunter along the\r\ncoast....\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ [Down] Oct. 6th, 1858.\r\n\r\n... If you have or can make leisure, I should very much like to hear\r\nnews of Mrs. Hooker, yourself, and the children. Where did you go, and\r\nwhat did you do and are doing? There is a comprehensive text.\r\n\r\nYou cannot tell how I enjoyed your little visit here. It did me much\r\ngood. If Harvey[153] is still with you, pray remember me very kindly to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n... I am working most steadily at my Abstract [_Origin of Species_], but\r\nit grows to an inordinate length; yet fully to make my view clear (and\r\nnever giving briefly more than a fact or two, and slurring over\r\ndifficulties), I cannot make it shorter. It will yet take me three or\r\nfour months; so slow do I work, though never idle. You cannot imagine\r\nwhat a service you have done me in making me make this Abstract; for\r\nthough I thought I had got all clear, it has clarified my brains very\r\nmuch, by making me weigh the relative importance of the several\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was not so fully occupied but that he could find time to help his\r\nboys in their collecting. He sent a short notice to the _Entomologists'\r\nWeekly Intelligencer_, June 25th, 1859, recording the capture of\r\n_Licinus silphoides_, _Clytus mysticus_, _Panagaeus 4-pustulatus_. The\r\nnotice begins with the words, \"We three very young collectors having\r\nlately taken in the parish of Down,\" &c., and is signed by three of his\r\nboys, but was clearly not written by them. I have a vivid recollection\r\nof the pleasure of turning out my bottle of dead beetles for my father\r\nto name, and the excitement, in which he fully shared, when any of them\r\nproved to be uncommon ones. The following letter to Mr. Fox (Nov. 13th,\r\n1858), illustrates this point:--\r\n\r\n\"I am reminded of old days by my third boy having just begun collecting\r\nbeetles, and he caught the other day _Brachinus crepitans_, of immortal\r\nWhittlesea Mere memory. My blood boiled with old ardour when he caught a\r\nLicinus--a prize unknown to me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again to Sir John Lubbock:--\r\n\r\n\"I feel like an old war-horse at the sound of the trumpet when I read\r\nabout the capturing of rare beetles--is not this a magnanimous simile\r\nfor a decayed entomologist?--It really almost makes me long to begin\r\ncollecting again. Adios.\r\n\r\n\"'Floreat Entomologia'!--to which toast at Cambridge I have drunk many a\r\nglass of wine. So again, 'Floreat Entomologia.'--N.B. I have _not_ now\r\nbeen drinking any glasses full of wine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down, Jan. 23rd, 1859.\r\n\r\n... I enclose letters to you and me from Wallace. I admire extremely the\r\nspirit in which they are written. I never felt very sure what he would\r\nsay. He must be an amiable man. Please return that to me, and Lyell\r\nought to be told how well satisfied he is. These letters have vividly\r\nbrought before me how much I owe to your and Lyell's most kind and\r\ngenerous conduct in all this affair.\r\n\r\n... How glad I shall be when the Abstract is finished, and I can\r\nrest!...\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to A. B. Wallace._ Down, Jan. 25th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I was extremely much pleased at receiving three days ago\r\nyour letter to me and that to Dr. Hooker. Permit me to say how heartily\r\nI admire the spirit in which they are written. Though I had absolutely\r\nnothing whatever to do in leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought\r\na fair course of action, yet I naturally could not but feel anxious to\r\nhear what your impression would be. I owe indirectly much to you and\r\nthem; for I almost think that Lyell would have proved right, and I\r\nshould never have completed my larger work, for I have found my Abstract\r\n[_Origin of Species_] hard enough with my poor health, but now, thank\r\nGod, I am in my last chapter but one. My Abstract will make a small\r\nvolume of 400 or 500 pages. Whenever published, I will, of course, send\r\nyou a copy, and then you will see what I mean about the part which I\r\nbelieve selection has played with domestic productions. It is a very\r\ndifferent part, as you suppose, from that played by \"Natural Selection.\"\r\nI sent off, by the same address as this note, a copy of the _Journal of\r\nthe Linnean Society_, and subsequently I have sent some half-dozen\r\ncopies of the paper. I have many other copies at your disposal....\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you have been attending to birds' nests. I have\r\ndone so, though almost exclusively under one point of view, viz. to show\r\nthat instincts vary, so that selection could work on and improve them.\r\nFew other instincts, so to speak, can be preserved in a Museum.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your offer to look after horses' stripes; if there are\r\nany donkeys, pray add them. I am delighted to hear that you have\r\ncollected bees' combs.... This is an especial hobby of mine, and I think\r\nI can throw a light on the subject. If you can collect duplicates at no\r\nvery great expense, I should be glad of some specimens for myself with\r\nsome bees of each kind. Young, growing, and irregular combs, and those\r\nwhich have not had pupae, are most valuable for measurements and\r\nexamination. Their edges should be well protected against abrasion.\r\n\r\nEvery one whom I have seen has thought your paper very well written and\r\ninteresting. It puts my extracts (written in 1839,[154] now just twenty\r\nyears ago!), which I must say in apology were never for an instant\r\nintended for publication, into the shade.\r\n\r\nYou ask about Lyell's frame of mind. I think he is somewhat staggered,\r\nbut does not give in, and speaks with horror, often to me, of what a\r\nthing it would be, and what a job it would be for the next edition of\r\n_The Principles_, if he were \"perverted.\" But he is most candid and\r\nhonest, and I think will end by being perverted. Dr. Hooker has become\r\nalmost as heterodox as you or I, and I look at Hooker as _by far_ the\r\nmost capable judge in Europe.\r\n\r\nMost cordially do I wish you health and entire success in all your\r\npursuits, and, God knows, if admirable zeal and energy deserve success,\r\nmost amply do you deserve it. I look at my own career as nearly run out.\r\nIf I can publish my Abstract and perhaps my greater work on the same\r\nsubject, I shall look at my course as done.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Sir, yours very sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March 1859 the work was telling heavily on him. He wrote to Fox:--\r\n\r\n\"I can see daylight through my work, and am now finally correcting my\r\nchapters for the press; and I hope in a month or six weeks to have\r\nproof-sheets. I am weary of my work. It is a very odd thing that I have\r\nno sensation that I overwork my brain; but facts compel me to conclude\r\nthat my brain was never formed for much thinking. We are resolved to go\r\nfor two or three months, when I have finished, to Ilkley, or some such\r\nplace, to see if I can anyhow give my health a good start, for it\r\ncertainly has been wretched of late, and has incapacitated me for\r\neverything. You do me injustice when you think that I work for fame; I\r\nvalue it to a certain extent; but, if I know myself, I work from a sort\r\nof instinct to try to make out truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down, March 28th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL,--If I keep decently well, I hope to be able to go to\r\npress with my volume early in May. This being so, I want much to beg a\r\nlittle advice from you. From an expression in Lady Lyell's note, I fancy\r\nthat you have spoken to Murray. Is it so? And is he willing to publish\r\nmy Abstract?[155] If you will tell me whether anything, and what has\r\npassed, I will then write to him. Does he know at all of the subject of\r\nthe book? Secondly, can you advise me whether I had better state what\r\nterms of publication I should prefer, or first ask him to propose\r\nterms? And what do you think would be fair terms for an edition? Share\r\nprofits, or what?\r\n\r\nLastly, will you be so very kind as to look at the enclosed title and\r\ngive me your opinion and any criticisms; you must remember that, if I\r\nhave health, and it appears worth doing, I have a much larger and full\r\nbook on the same subject nearly ready.\r\n\r\nMy Abstract will be about five hundred pages of the size of your first\r\nedition of the _Elements of Geology_.\r\n\r\nPray forgive me troubling you with the above queries; and you shall have\r\nno more trouble on the subject. I hope the world goes well with you, and\r\nthat you are getting on with your various works.\r\n\r\nI am working very hard for me, and long to finish and be free and try to\r\nrecover some health.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, ever yours.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Would you advise me to tell Murray that my book is not more\r\n_un_-orthodox than the subject makes inevitable. That I do not discuss\r\nthe origin of man. That I do not bring in any discussion about Genesis,\r\n&c. &c., and only give facts, and such conclusions from them as seem to\r\nme fair.\r\n\r\nOr had I better say _nothing_ to Murray, and assume that he cannot\r\nobject to this much unorthodoxy, which in fact is not more than any\r\nGeological Treatise which runs slap counter to Genesis.\r\n\r\n_Enclosure._\r\n\r\nAN ABSTRACT OF AN ESSAY ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES\r\nAND VARIETIES THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DARWIN, M.A.\r\nFELLOW OF THE ROYAL, GEOLOGICAL, AND LINNEAN SOCIETIES.\r\nLONDON: &c. &c. &c. &c. 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down, March 30th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL,--You have been uncommonly kind in all you have done. You\r\nnot only have saved me much trouble and some anxiety, but have done all\r\nincomparably better than I could have done it. I am much pleased at all\r\nyou say about Murray. I will write either to-day or to-morrow to him,\r\nand will send shortly a large bundle of MS., but unfortunately I cannot\r\nfor a week, as the first three chapters are in the copyists' hands.\r\n\r\nI am sorry about Murray objecting to the term Abstract, as I look at it\r\nas the only possible apology for _not_ giving references and facts in\r\nfull, but I will defer to him and you. I am also sorry about the term\r\n\"natural selection.\" I hope to retain it with explanation somewhat as\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Through natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy I like the term is that it is constantly used in all works on\r\nbreeding, and I am surprised that it is not familiar to Murray; but I\r\nhave so long studied such works that I have ceased to be a competent\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nI again most truly and cordially thank you for your really valuable\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nYours most truly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down, April 2nd [1859].\r\n\r\n... I wrote to him [Mr. Murray] and gave him the headings of the\r\nchapters, and told him he could not have the MS. for ten days or so; and\r\nthis morning I received a letter, offering me handsome terms, and\r\nagreeing to publish without seeing the MS.! So he is eager enough; I\r\nthink I should have been cautious, anyhow, but, owing to your letter, I\r\ntold him most _explicitly_ that I accept his offer solely on condition\r\nthat, after he has seen part or all the MS. he has full power of\r\nretracting. You will think me presumptuous, but I think my book will be\r\npopular to a certain extent (enough to ensure [against] heavy loss)\r\namongst scientific and semi-scientific men; why I think so is, because I\r\nhave found in conversation so great and surprising an interest amongst\r\nsuch men, and some 0-scientific [non-scientific] men on this subject,\r\nand all my chapters are not _nearly_ so dry and dull as that which you\r\nhave read on geographical distribution. Anyhow, Murray ought to be the\r\nbest judge, and if he chooses to publish it, I think I may wash my\r\nhands of all responsibility. I am sure my friends, _i.e._ Lyell and you,\r\nhave been _extraordinarily_ kind in troubling yourselves on the matter.\r\n\r\nI shall be delighted to see you the day before Good Friday; there would\r\nbe one advantage for you in any other day--as I believe both my boys\r\ncome home on that day--and it would be almost impossible that I could\r\nsend the carriage for you. There will, I believe, be some relations in\r\nthe house--but I hope you will not care for that, as we shall easily get\r\nas much talking as my _imbecile state_ allows. I shall deeply enjoy\r\nseeing you.\r\n\r\n... I am tired, so no more.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Please to send, well _tied up_ with strong string, my Geographical\r\nMS. towards the latter half of next week--_i.e._ 7th or 8th--that I may\r\nsend it with more to Murray; and God help him if he tries to read it.\r\n\r\n... I cannot help a little doubting whether Lyell would take much pains\r\nto induce Murray to publish my book; this was not done at my request,\r\nand it rather grates against my pride.\r\n\r\nI know that Lyell has been _infinitely_ kind about my affair, but your\r\ndashed [_i.e._ underlined] \"_induce_\" gives the idea that Lyell had\r\nunfairly urged Murray.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. Murray._ Down, April 6th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I send by this post, the Title (with some remarks on a\r\nseparate page), and the first three chapters. If you have patience to\r\nread all Chapter I., I honestly think you will have a fair notion of the\r\ninterest of the whole book. It may be conceit, but I believe the subject\r\nwill interest the public, and I am sure that the views are original. If\r\nyou think otherwise, I must repeat my request that you will freely\r\nreject my work; and though I shall be a little disappointed, I shall be\r\nin no way injured.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to read Chapters II. and III., you will have a dull and\r\nrather abstruse chapter, and a plain and interesting one, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you have done with the MS., please to send it by _careful\r\nmessenger, and plainly directed_, to Miss G. Tollett,[156] 14, Queen\r\nAnne Street, Cavendish Square.\r\n\r\nThis lady, being an excellent judge of style, is going to look out for\r\nerrors for me.\r\n\r\nYou must take your own time, but the sooner you finish, the sooner she\r\nwill, and the sooner I shall get to press, which I so earnestly wish.\r\n\r\nI presume you will wish to see Chapter IV.,[157] the key-stone of my\r\narch, and Chapters X. and XI., but please to inform me on this head.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 11th he wrote to Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I write one line to say that I heard from Murray yesterday, and he says\r\nhe has read the first three chapters of [my] MS. (and this includes a\r\nvery dull one), and he abides by his offer. Hence he does not want more\r\nMS., and you can send my Geographical chapter when it pleases you.\"\r\n\r\nPart of the MS. seems to have been lost on its way back to my father. He\r\nwrote (April 14) to Sir J. D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I have the old MS., otherwise the loss would have killed me! The worst\r\nis now that it will cause delay in getting to press, and far worst of\r\nall, I lose all advantage of your having looked over my chapter,[158]\r\nexcept the third part returned. I am very sorry Mrs. Hooker took the\r\ntrouble of copying the two pages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ [April or May, 1859.]\r\n\r\n... Please do not say to any one that I thought my book on species would\r\nbe fairly popular, and have a fairly remunerative sale (which was the\r\nheight of my ambition), for if it prove a dead failure, it would make me\r\nthe more ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI enclose a criticism, a taste of the future--\r\n\r\n_Rev. S. Haughton's Address to the Geological Society, Dublin._[159]\r\n\r\n\"This speculation of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace would not be worthy of\r\nnotice were it not for the weight of authority of the names (_i.e._\r\nLyell's and yours), under whose auspices it has been brought forward. If\r\nit means what it says, it is a truism; if it means anything more, it is\r\ncontrary to fact.\"\r\n\r\nQ. E. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down, May 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--Thank you for telling me about obscurity of style. But\r\non my life no nigger with lash over him could have worked harder at\r\nclearness than I have done. But the very difficulty to me, of itself\r\nleads to the probability that I fail. Yet one lady who has read all my\r\nMS. has found only two or three obscure sentences; but Mrs. Hooker\r\nhaving so found it, makes me tremble. I will do my best in proofs. You\r\nare a good man to take the trouble to write about it.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our mutual muddle,[160] I never for a moment thought we\r\ncould not make our ideas clear to each other by talk, or if either of us\r\nhad time to write _in extenso_.\r\n\r\nI imagine from some expressions (but if you ask me what, I could not\r\nanswer) that you look at variability as some necessary contingency with\r\norganisms, and further that there is some necessary tendency in the\r\nvariability to go on diverging in character or degree. _If you do_, I do\r\nnot agree. \"Reversion\" again (a form of inheritance), I look at as in no\r\nway directly connected with Variation, though of course inheritance is\r\nof fundamental importance to us, for if a variation be not inherited, it\r\nis of no signification to us. It was on such points as these I _fancied_\r\nthat we perhaps started differently.\r\n\r\nI fear that my book will not deserve at all the pleasant things you say\r\nabout it, and Good Lord, how I do long to have done with it!\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, I have received and have been _much\r\ninterested_ by A. Gray. I am delighted at his note about my and\r\nWallace's paper. He will go round, for it is futile to give up very many\r\nspecies, and stop at an arbitrary line at others. It is what my father\r\ncalled Unitarianism, \"a featherbed to catch a falling Christian.\"...\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. Murray._ Down, June 14th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--The diagram will do very well, and I will send it shortly\r\nto Mr. West to have a few trifling corrections made.\r\n\r\nI get on very slowly with proofs. I remember writing to you that I\r\nthought there would be not much correction. I honestly wrote what I\r\nthought, but was most grievously mistaken. I find the style incredibly\r\nbad, and most difficult to make clear and smooth. I am extremely sorry\r\nto say, on account of expense, and loss of time for me, that the\r\ncorrections are very heavy, as heavy as possible. But from casual\r\nglances, I still hope that later chapters are not so badly written. How\r\nI could have written so badly is quite inconceivable, but I suppose it\r\nwas owing to my whole attention being fixed on the general line of\r\nargument, and not on details. All I can say is, that I am very sorry.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down [Sept.] 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--I corrected the last proof yesterday, and I have now my\r\nrevises, index, &c., which will take me near to the end of the month. So\r\nthat the neck of my work, thank God, is broken.\r\n\r\nI write now to say that I am uneasy in my conscience about hesitating to\r\nlook over your proofs,[161] but I was feeling miserably unwell and\r\nshattered when I wrote. I do not suppose I could be of hardly any use,\r\nbut if I could, pray send me any proofs. I should be (and fear I was)\r\nthe most ungrateful man to hesitate to do anything for you after some\r\nfifteen or more years' help from you.\r\n\r\nAs soon as ever I have fairly finished I shall be off to Ilkley, or some\r\nother Hydropathic establishment. But I shall be some time yet, as my\r\nproofs have been so utterly obscured with corrections, that I have to\r\ncorrect heavily on revises.\r\n\r\nMurray proposes to publish the first week in November. Oh, good heavens,\r\nthe relief to my head and body to banish the whole subject from my mind!\r\n\r\nI hope you do not think me a brute about your proof-sheets.\r\n\r\nFarewell, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter is interesting as showing with what a very moderate\r\namount of recognition he was satisfied,--and more than satisfied.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell was President of the Geological section at the meeting\r\nof the British Association at Aberdeen in 1859. In his address he\r\nsaid:--\"On this difficult and mysterious subject [Evolution] a work will\r\nvery shortly appear by Mr. Charles Darwin, the result of twenty years\r\nof observations and experiments in Zoology, Botany, and Geology, by\r\nwhich he has been led to the conclusion that those powers of nature\r\nwhich give rise to races and permanent varieties in animals and plants,\r\nare the same as those which in much longer periods produce species, and\r\nin a still longer series of ages give rise to differences of generic\r\nrank. He appears to me to have succeeded by his investigations and\r\nreasonings in throwing a flood of light on many classes of phenomena\r\nconnected with the affinities, geographical distribution, and geological\r\nsuccession of organic beings, for which no other hypothesis has been\r\nable, or has even attempted to account.\"\r\n\r\nMy father wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"You once gave me intense pleasure, or rather delight, by the way you\r\nwere interested, in a manner I never expected, in my Coral Reef notions,\r\nand now you have again given me similar pleasure by the manner you have\r\nnoticed my species work. Nothing could be more satisfactory to me, and I\r\nthank you for myself, and even more for the subject's sake, as I know\r\nwell that the sentence will make many fairly consider the subject,\r\ninstead of ridiculing it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, a few days later:--\r\n\r\n\"I do thank you for your eulogy at Aberdeen. I have been so wearied and\r\nexhausted of late that I have for months doubted whether I have not been\r\nthrowing away time and labour for nothing. But now I care not what the\r\nuniversal world says; I have always found you right, and certainly on\r\nthis occasion I am not going to doubt for the first time. Whether you go\r\nfar, or but a very short way with me and others who believe as I do, I\r\nam contented, for my work cannot be in vain. You would laugh if you knew\r\nhow often I have read your paragraph, and it has acted like a little\r\ndram.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down, Sept. 30th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL,--I sent off this morning the last sheets, but without\r\nindex, which is not in type. I look at you as my Lord High Chancellor in\r\nNatural Science, and therefore I request you, after you have finished,\r\njust to _re-run_ over the heads in the recapitulation-part of the last\r\nchapter. I shall be deeply anxious to hear what you decide (if you are\r\nable to decide) on the balance of the pros and contras given in my\r\nvolume, and of such other pros and contras as may occur to you. I hope\r\nthat you will think that I have given the difficulties fairly. I feel an\r\nentire conviction that if you are now staggered to any moderate extent,\r\nyou will come more and more round, the longer you keep the subject at\r\nall before your mind. I remember well how many long years it was before\r\nI could look into the face of some of the difficulties and not feel\r\nquite abashed. I fairly struck my colours before the case of neuter\r\ninsects.[162]\r\n\r\nI suppose that I am a very slow thinker, for you would be surprised at\r\nthe number of years it took me to see clearly what some of the problems\r\nwere which had to be solved, such as the necessity of the principle of\r\ndivergence of character, the extinction of intermediate varieties, on a\r\ncontinuous area, with graduated conditions; the double problem of\r\nsterile first crosses and sterile hybrids, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I think it was more difficult to see what the problems\r\nwere than to solve them, so far as I have succeeded in doing, and this\r\nseems to me rather curious. Well, good or bad, my work, thank God, is\r\nover; and hard work, I can assure you, I have had, and much work which\r\nhas never borne fruit. You can see, by the way I am scribbling, that I\r\nhave an idle and rainy afternoon. I was not able to start for Ilkley\r\nyesterday as I was too unwell; but I hope to get there on Tuesday or\r\nWednesday. Do, I beg you, when you have finished my book and thought a\r\nlittle over it, let me hear from you. Never mind and pitch into me, if\r\nyou think it requisite; some future day, in London possibly, you may\r\ngive me a few criticisms in detail, that is, if you have scribbled any\r\nremarks on the margin, for the chance of a second edition.\r\n\r\nMurray has printed 1250 copies, which seems to me rather too large an\r\nedition, but I hope he will not lose.\r\n\r\nI make as much fuss about my book as if it were my first. Forgive me,\r\nand believe me, my dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nYours most sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book was at last finished and printed, and he wrote to Mr. Murray:--\r\n\r\n\r\nIlkley, Yorkshire [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I have received your kind note and the copy; I am\r\ninfinitely pleased and proud at the appearance of my child.\r\n\r\nI quite agree to all you propose about price. But you are really too\r\ngenerous about the, to me, scandalously heavy corrections. Are you not\r\nacting unfairly towards yourself? Would it not be better at least to\r\nshare the L72 8s.? I shall be fully satisfied, for I had no business to\r\nsend, though quite unintentionally and unexpectedly, such badly composed\r\nMS. to the printers.\r\n\r\nThank you for your kind offer to distribute the copies to my friends and\r\nassisters as soon as possible. Do not trouble yourself much about the\r\nforeigners, as Messrs.

Lyell to C. Darwin._ October 3rd, 1859.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--I have just finished your volume, and right glad I am\r\nthat I did my best with Hooker to persuade you to publish it without\r\nwaiting for a time which probably could never have arrived, though you\r\nlived till the age of a hundred, when you had prepared all your facts on\r\nwhich you ground so many grand generalizations.\r\n\r\nIt is a splendid case of close reasoning, and long substantial argument\r\nthroughout so many pages; the condensation immense, too great perhaps\r\nfor the uninitiated, but an effective and important preliminary\r\nstatement, which will admit, even before your detailed proofs appear, of\r\nsome occasional useful exemplification, such as your pigeons and\r\ncirripedes, of which you make such excellent use.\r\n\r\nI mean that, when, as I fully expect, a new edition is soon called for,\r\nyou may here and there insert an actual case to relieve the vast number\r\nof abstract propositions. So far as I am concerned, I am so well\r\nprepared to take your statements of facts for granted, that I do not\r\nthink the \"pieces justificatives\" when published will make much\r\ndifference, and I have long seen most clearly that if any concession is\r\nmade, all that you claim in your concluding pages will follow. It is\r\nthis which has made me so long hesitate, always feeling that the case of\r\nMan and his races, and of other animals, and that of plants is one and\r\nthe same, and that if a \"vera causa\" be admitted for one, instead of a\r\npurely unknown and imaginary one, such as the word \"Creation,\" all the\r\nconsequences must follow.\r\n\r\nI fear I have not time to-day, as I am just leaving this place to\r\nindulge in a variety of comments, and to say how much I was delighted\r\nwith Oceanic Islands--Rudimentary Organs--Embryology--the genealogical\r\nkey to the Natural System, Geographical Distribution, and if I went on I\r\nshould be copying the heads of all your chapters. But I will say a word\r\nof the Recapitulation, in case some slight alteration, or, at least,\r\nomission of a word or two be still possible in that.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, at p. 480, it cannot surely be said that the most\r\neminent naturalists have rejected the view of the mutability of species?\r\nYou do not mean to ignore G. St. Hilaire and Lamarck. As to the latter,\r\nyou may say, that in regard to animals you substitute natural selection\r\nfor volition to a certain considerable extent, but in his theory of the\r\nchanges of plants he could not introduce volition; he may, no doubt,\r\nhave laid an undue comparative stress on changes in physical conditions,\r\nand too little on those of contending organisms. He at least was for the\r\nuniversal mutability of species and for a genealogical link between the\r\nfirst and the present. The men of his school also appealed to\r\ndomesticated varieties. (Do you mean _living_ naturalists?)[163]\r\n\r\nThe first page of this most important summary gives the adversary an\r\nadvantage, by putting forth so abruptly and crudely such a startling\r\nobjection as the formation of \"the eye,\"[164] not by means analogous to\r\nman's reason, or rather by some power immeasurably superior to human\r\nreason, but by superinduced variation like those of which a\r\ncattle-breeder avails himself. Pages would be required thus to state an\r\nobjection and remove it. It would be better, as you wish to persuade, to\r\nsay nothing. Leave out several sentences, and in a future edition bring\r\nit out more fully.\r\n\r\n... But these are small matters, mere spots on the sun. Your comparison\r\nof the letters retained in words, when no longer wanted for the sound,\r\nto rudimentary organs is excellent, as both are truly genealogical....\r\n\r\nYou enclose your sheets in old MS., so the Post Office very properly\r\ncharge them, as letters, 2_d._ extra. I wish all their fines on MS. were\r\nworth as much. I paid 4_s._ 6_d._ for such wash the other day from\r\nParis, from a man who can prove 300 deluges in the valley of Seine.\r\n\r\nWith my hearty congratulations to you on your grand work, believe me,\r\n\r\nEver very affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to L. Agassiz._[165] Down, November 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I have ventured to send you a copy of my book (as yet only\r\nan abstract) on the _Origin of Species_. As the conclusions at which I\r\nhave arrived on several points differ so widely from yours, I have\r\nthought (should you at any time read my volume) that you might think\r\nthat I had sent it to you out of a spirit of defiance or bravado; but I\r\nassure you that I act under a wholly different frame of mind. I hope\r\nthat you will at least give me credit, however erroneous you may think\r\nmy conclusions, for having earnestly endeavoured to arrive at the truth.\r\nWith sincere respect, I beg leave to remain,\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sent copies of the _Origin_, accompanied by letters similar to the\r\nlast, to M. De Candolle, Dr. Asa Gray, Falconer and Mr. Jenyns\r\n(Blomefield).\r\n\r\nTo Henslow he wrote (Nov. 11th, 1859):--\r\n\r\n\"I have told Murray to send a copy of my book on Species to you, my dear\r\nold master in Natural History; I fear, however, that you will not\r\napprove of your pupil in this case. The book in its present state does\r\nnot show the amount of labour which I have bestowed on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"If you have time to read it carefully, and would take the trouble to\r\npoint out what parts seem weakest to you and what best, it would be a\r\nmost material aid to me in writing my bigger book, which I hope to\r\ncommence in a few months. You know also how highly I value your\r\njudgment. But I am not so unreasonable as to wish or expect you to write\r\ndetailed and lengthy criticisms, but merely a few general remarks,\r\npointing out the weakest parts.\r\n\r\n\"If you are _in ever so slight a degree_ staggered (which I hardly\r\nexpect) on the immutability of species, then I am convinced with further\r\nreflection you will become more and more staggered, for this has been\r\nthe process through which my mind has gone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to A. R. Wallace._ Ilkley, November 13th, 1859.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I have told Murray to send you by post (if possible) a\r\ncopy of my book, and I hope that you will receive it at nearly the same\r\ntime with this note. (N.B. I have got a bad finger, which makes me write\r\nextra badly.) If you are so inclined, I should very much like to hear\r\nyour general impression of the book, as you have thought so profoundly\r\non the subject, and in so nearly the same channel with myself. I hope\r\nthere will be some little new to you, but I fear not much. Remember it\r\nis only an abstract, and very much condensed. God knows what the public\r\nwill think. No one has read it, except Lyell, with whom I have had much\r\ncorrespondence. Hooker thinks him a complete convert, but he does not\r\nseem so in his letters to me; but is evidently deeply interested in the\r\nsubject. I do not think your share in the theory will be overlooked by\r\nthe real judges, as Hooker, Lyell, Asa Gray, &c. I have heard from Mr.\r\nSclater that your paper on the Malay Archipelago has been read at the\r\nLinnean Society, and that he was _extremely_ much interested by it.\r\n\r\nI have not seen one naturalist for six or nine months, owing to the\r\nstate of my health, and therefore I really have no news to tell you. I\r\nam writing this at Ilkley Wells, where I have been with my family for\r\nthe last six weeks, and shall stay for some few weeks longer. As yet I\r\nhave profited very little. God knows when I shall have strength for my\r\nbigger book.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that you keep your health; I suppose that you will be\r\nthinking of returning[166] soon with your magnificent collections, and\r\nstill grander mental materials. You will be puzzled how to publish. The\r\nRoyal Society fund will be worth your consideration. With every good\r\nwish, pray believe me,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I think that I told you before that Hooker is a complete convert.\r\nIf I can convert Huxley I shall be content.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. Darwin to W. B. Carpenter._ November 19th [1859].\r\n\r\n... If, after reading my book, you are able to come to a conclusion in\r\nany degree definite, will you think me very unreasonable in asking you\r\nto let me hear from you? I do not ask for a long discussion, but merely\r\nfor a brief idea of your general impression. From your widely extended\r\nknowledge, habit of investigating the truth, and abilities, I should\r\nvalue your opinion in the very highest rank. Though I, of course,\r\nbelieve in the truth of my own doctrine, I suspect that no belief is\r\nvivid until shared by others. As yet I know only one believer, but I\r\nlook at him as of the greatest authority, viz. Hooker. When I think of\r\nthe many cases of men who have studied one subject for years, and have\r\npersuaded themselves of the truth of the foolishest doctrines, I feel\r\nsometimes a little frightened, whether I may not be one of these\r\nmonomaniacs.\r\n\r\nAgain pray excuse this, I fear, unreasonable request. A short note would\r\nsuffice, and I could bear a hostile verdict, and shall have to bear many\r\na one.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Ilkley, Yorkshire. [November, 1859.]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--I have just read a review on my book in the\r\n_Athenaeum_[167] and it excites my curiosity much who is the author. If\r\nyou should hear who writes in the _Athenaeum_ I wish you would tell me.\r\nIt seems to me well done, but the reviewer gives no new objections, and,\r\nbeing hostile, passes over every single argument in favour of the\r\ndoctrine.... I fear, from the tone of the review, that I have written in\r\na conceited and cocksure style,[168] which shames me a little. There is\r\nanother review of which I should like to know the author, viz. of H. C.\r\nWatson in the _Gardeners' Chronicle_.[169] Some of the remarks are like\r\nyours, and he does deserve punishment; but surely the review is too\r\nsevere. Don't you think so?...\r\n\r\nI have heard from Carpenter, who, I think, is likely to be a convert.\r\nAlso from Quatrefages, who is inclined to go a long way with us. He says\r\nthat he exhibited in his lecture a diagram closely like mine!\r\n\r\n\r\n_J. D. Hooker to C. Darwin._ Monday [Nov. 21, 1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--I am a sinner not to have written you ere this, if only\r\nto thank you for your glorious book--what a mass of close reasoning on\r\ncurious facts and fresh phenomena--it is capitally written, and will be\r\nvery successful. I say this on the strength of two or three plunges into\r\nas many chapters, for I have not yet attempted to read it. Lyell, with\r\nwhom we are staying, is perfectly enchanted, and is absolutely gloating\r\nover it. I must accept your compliment to me, and acknowledgment of\r\nsupposed assistance[170] from me, as the warm tribute of affection from\r\nan honest (though deluded) man, and furthermore accept it as very\r\npleasing to my vanity; but, my dear fellow, neither my name nor my\r\njudgment nor my assistance deserved any such compliments, and if I am\r\ndishonest enough to be pleased with what I don't deserve, it must just\r\npass. How different the _book_ reads from the MS. I see I shall have\r\nmuch to talk over with you. Those lazy printers have not finished my\r\nluckless Essay: which, beside your book, will look like a ragged\r\nhandkerchief beside a Royal Standard....\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ [November, 1859.]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--I cannot help it, I must thank you for your\r\naffectionate and most kind note. My head will be turned. By Jove, I must\r\ntry and get a bit modest. I was a little chagrined by the review.[171] I\r\nhope it was _not_ ----. As advocate, he might think himself justified in\r\ngiving the argument only on one side. But the manner in which he drags\r\nin immortality, and sets the priests at me, and leaves me to their\r\nmercies, is base. He would, on no account, burn me, but he will get the\r\nwood ready, and tell the black beasts how to catch me.... It would be\r\nunspeakably grand if Huxley were to lecture on the subject, but I can\r\nsee this is a mere chance; Faraday might think it too unorthodox.\r\n\r\n... I had a letter from [Huxley] with such tremendous praise of my book,\r\nthat modesty (as I am trying to cultivate that difficult herb) prevents\r\nme sending it to you, which I should have liked to have done, as he is\r\nvery modest about himself.\r\n\r\nYou have cockered me up to that extent, that I now feel I can face a\r\nscore of savage reviewers. I suppose you are still with the Lyells. Give\r\nmy kindest remembrance to them. I triumph to hear that he continues to\r\napprove.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, your would-be modest friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following passage from a letter to Lyell shows how strongly he felt\r\non the subject of Lyell's adherence:--\"I rejoice profoundly that you\r\nintend admitting the doctrine of modification in your new edition;[172]\r\nnothing, I am convinced, could be more important for its success. I\r\nhonour you most sincerely. To have maintained in the position of a\r\nmaster, one side of a question for thirty years, and then deliberately\r\ngive it up, is a fact to which I much doubt whether the records of\r\nscience offer a parallel. For myself, also I rejoice profoundly; for,\r\nthinking of so many cases of men pursuing an illusion for years, often\r\nand often a cold shudder has run through me, and I have asked myself\r\nwhether I may not have devoted my life to a phantasy. Now I look at it\r\nas morally impossible that investigators of truth, like you and Hooker,\r\ncan be wholly wrong, and therefore I rest in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_T. H. Huxley[173] to C. Darwin._ Jermyn Street, W. November 23rd, 1859.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--I finished your book yesterday, a lucky examination\r\nhaving furnished me with a few hours of continuous leisure.\r\n\r\nSince I read Von Baer's[174] essays, nine years ago, no work on Natural\r\nHistory Science I have met with has made so great an impression upon me,\r\nand I do most heartily thank you for the great store of new views you\r\nhave given me. Nothing, I think, can be better than the tone of the\r\nbook, it impresses those who know nothing about the subject. As for your\r\ndoctrine, I am prepared to go to the stake, if requisite, in support of\r\nChapter IX.,[175] and most parts of Chapters X., XI., XII.; and Chapter\r\nXIII. contains much that is most admirable, but on one or two points I\r\nenter a _caveat_ until I can see further into all sides of the question.\r\n\r\nAs to the first four chapters, I agree thoroughly and fully with all\r\nthe principles laid down in them. I think you have demonstrated a true\r\ncause for the production of species, and have thrown the _onus\r\nprobandi_, that species did not arise in the way you suppose, on your\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\nBut I feel that I have not yet by any means fully realized the bearings\r\nof those most remarkable and original Chapters III., IV. and V., and I\r\nwill write no more about them just now.\r\n\r\nThe only objections that have occurred to me are, 1st that you have\r\nloaded yourself with an unnecessary difficulty in adopting _Natura non\r\nfacit saltum_ so unreservedly.... And 2nd, it is not clear to me why, if\r\ncontinual physical conditions are of so little moment as you suppose,\r\nvariation should occur at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must read the book two or three times more before I presume\r\nto begin picking holes.\r\n\r\nI trust you will not allow yourself to be in any way disgusted or\r\nannoyed by the considerable abuse and misrepresentation which, unless I\r\ngreatly mistake, is in store for you. Depend upon it you have earned the\r\nlasting gratitude of all thoughtful men. And as to the curs which will\r\nbark and yelp, you must recollect that some of your friends, at any\r\nrate, are endowed with an amount of combativeness which (though you have\r\noften and justly rebuked it) may stand you in good stead.\r\n\r\nI am sharpening up my claws and beak in readiness.\r\n\r\nLooking back over my letter, it really expresses so feebly all I think\r\nabout you and your noble book that I am half ashamed of it; but you will\r\nunderstand that, like the parrot in the story, \"I think the more.\"\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to T. H. Huxley._ Ilkley, Nov. 25 [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HUXLEY,--Your letter has been forwarded to me from Down. Like a\r\ngood Catholic who has received extreme unction, I can now sing \"nunc\r\ndimittis.\" I should have been more than contented with one quarter of\r\nwhat you have said. Exactly fifteen months ago, when I put pen to paper\r\nfor this volume, I had awful misgivings; and thought perhaps I had\r\ndeluded myself, like so many have done, and I then fixed in my mind\r\nthree judges, on whose decision I determined mentally to abide. The\r\njudges were Lyell, Hooker, and yourself. It was this which made me so\r\nexcessively anxious for your verdict. I am now contented, and can sing\r\nmy \"nunc dimittis.\" What a joke it would be if I pat you on the back\r\nwhen you attack some immovable creationists! You have most cleverly hit\r\non one point, which has greatly troubled me; if, as I must think,\r\nexternal conditions produce little _direct_ effect, what the devil\r\ndetermines each particular variation? What makes a tuft of feathers come\r\non a cock's head, or moss on a moss-rose? I shall much like to talk over\r\nthis with you....\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley, I thank you cordially for your letter.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Erasmus Darwin[176] to C. Darwin._ November 23rd [1859].\r\n\r\nDEAR CHARLES,--I am so much weaker in the head, that I hardly know if\r\nI can write, but at all events I will jot down a few things that the\r\nDr.[177] has said. He has not read much above half, so, as he says, he\r\ncan give no definite conclusion, and keeps stating that he is not\r\ntied down to either view, and that he has always left an escape by\r\nthe way he has spoken of varieties. I happened to speak of the eye\r\nbefore he had read that part, and it took away his breath--utterly\r\nimpossible--structure--function, &c., &c., &c., but when he had read it\r\nhe hummed and hawed, and perhaps it was partly conceivable, and then he\r\nfell back on the bones of the ear, which were beyond all probability or\r\nconceivability. He mentioned a slight blot, which I also observed, that\r\nin speaking of the slave-ants carrying one another, you change the\r\nspecies without giving notice first, and it makes one turn back....\r\n\r\n... For myself I really think it is the most interesting book I ever\r\nread, and can only compare it to the first knowledge of chemistry,\r\ngetting into a new world or rather behind the scenes. To me the\r\ngeographical distribution, I mean the relation of islands to continents\r\nis the most convincing of the proofs, and the relation of the oldest\r\nforms to the existing species. I dare say I don't feel enough the\r\nabsence of varieties, but then I don't in the least know if everything\r\nnow living were fossilized whether the palaeontologists could distinguish\r\nthem. In fact the _a priori_ reasoning is so entirely satisfactory to me\r\nthat if the facts won't fit in, why so much the worse for the facts is\r\nmy feeling. My ague has left me in such a state of torpidity that I wish\r\nI had gone through the process of natural selection.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. Sedgwick[178] to C. Darwin._ [November 1859.]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--I write to thank you for your work on the _Origin of\r\nSpecies_. It came, I think, in the latter part of last week; but it may\r\nhave come a few days sooner, and been overlooked among my book-parcels,\r\nwhich often remain unopened when I am lazy or busy with any work before\r\nme. So soon as I opened it I began to read it, and I finished it, after\r\nmany interruptions, on Tuesday. Yesterday I was employed--1st, in\r\npreparing for my lecture; 2ndly, in attending a meeting of my brother\r\nFellows to discuss the final propositions of the Parliamentary\r\nCommissioners; 3rdly, in lecturing; 4thly, in hearing the conclusion of\r\nthe discussion and the College reply, whereby, in conformity with my own\r\nwishes, we accepted the scheme of the Commissioners; 5thly, in dining\r\nwith an old friend at Clare College; 6thly, in adjourning to the weekly\r\nmeeting of the Ray Club, from which I returned at 10 P.M., dog-tired,\r\nand hardly able to climb my staircase. Lastly, in looking through the\r\n_Times_ to see what was going on in the busy world.\r\n\r\nI do not state this to fill space (though I believe that Nature does\r\nabhor a vacuum), but to prove that my reply and my thanks are sent to\r\nyou by the earliest leisure I have, though that is but a very contracted\r\nopportunity. If I did not think you a good-tempered and truth-loving\r\nman, I should not tell you that (spite of the great knowledge, store of\r\nfacts, capital views of the correlation of the various parts of organic\r\nnature, admirable hints about the diffusion, through wide regions, of\r\nmany related organic beings, &c. &c.) I have read your book with more\r\npain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly, parts I laughed at\r\ntill my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow,\r\nbecause I think them utterly false and grievously mischievous. You have\r\n_deserted_--after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical\r\ntruth--the true method of induction, and started us in machinery as\r\nwild, I think, as Bishop Wilkins's locomotive that was to sail with us\r\nto the moon. Many of your wide conclusions are based upon assumptions\r\nwhich can neither be proved nor disproved, why then express them in the\r\nlanguage and arrangement of philosophical induction? As to your grand\r\nprinciple--_natural selection_--what is it but a secondary consequence\r\nof supposed, or known, primary facts? Development is a better word,\r\nbecause more close to the cause of the fact? For you do not deny\r\ncausation. I call (in the abstract) causation the will of God; and I can\r\nprove that He acts for the good of His creatures. He also acts by laws\r\nwhich we can study and comprehend. Acting by law, and under what is\r\ncalled final causes, comprehends, I think, your whole principle. You\r\nwrite of \"natural selection\" as if it were done consciously by the\r\nselecting agent. 'Tis but a consequence of the pre-supposed development,\r\nand the subsequent battle for life. This view of nature you have stated\r\nadmirably, though admitted by all naturalists and denied by no one of\r\ncommon-sense. We all admit development as a fact of history: but how\r\ncame it about? Here, in language, and still more in logic, we are\r\npoint-blank at issue. There is a moral or metaphysical part of nature as\r\nwell as a physical. A man who denies this is deep in the mire of folly.\r\n'Tis the crown and glory of organic science that it _does_ through\r\n_final cause_, link material and moral; and yet _does not_ allow us to\r\nmingle them in our first conception of laws, and our classification of\r\nsuch laws, whether we consider one side of nature or the other. You have\r\nignored this link; and, if I do not mistake your meaning, you have done\r\nyour best in one or two pregnant cases to break it. Were it possible\r\n(which, thank God, it is not) to break it, humanity, in my mind, would\r\nsuffer a damage that might brutalize it, and sink the human race into a\r\nlower grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its\r\nwritten records tell us of its history. Take the case of the bee-cells.\r\nIf your development produced the successive modification of the bee and\r\nits cells (which no mortal can prove), final cause would stand good as\r\nthe directing cause under which the successive generations acted and\r\ngradually improved. Passages in your book, like that to which I have\r\nalluded (and there are others almost as bad), greatly shocked my moral\r\ntaste. I think, in speculating on organic descent, you _over_-state the\r\nevidence of geology; and that you _under_-state it while you are talking\r\nof the broken links of your natural pedigree: but my paper is nearly\r\ndone, and I must go to my lecture-room. Lastly, then, I greatly dislike\r\nthe concluding chapter--not as a summary, for in that light it appears\r\ngood--but I dislike it from the tone of triumphant confidence in which\r\nyou appeal to the rising generation (in a tone I condemned in the author\r\nof the _Vestiges_) and prophesy of things not yet in the womb of time,\r\nnor (if we are to trust the accumulated experience of human sense and\r\nthe inferences of its logic) ever likely to be found anywhere but in the\r\nfertile womb of man's imagination. And now to say a word about a son of\r\na monkey and an old friend of yours: I am better, far better, than I\r\nwas last year. I have been lecturing three days a week (formerly I gave\r\nsix a week) without much fatigue, but I find by the loss of activity and\r\nmemory, and of all productive powers, that my bodily frame is sinking\r\nslowly towards the earth. But I have visions of the future. They are as\r\nmuch a part of myself as my stomach and my heart, and these visions are\r\nto have their anti-type in solid fruition of what is best and greatest.\r\nBut on one condition only--that I humbly accept God's revelation of\r\nHimself both in His works and in His word, and do my best to act in\r\nconformity with that knowledge which He only can give me, and He only\r\ncan sustain me in doing. If you and I do all this, we shall meet in\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nI have written in a hurry, and in a spirit of brotherly love, therefore\r\nforgive any sentence you happen to dislike; and believe me, spite of any\r\ndisagreement in some points of the deepest moral interest, your\r\ntrue-hearted old friend,\r\n\r\nA. SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a note to Lyell (Nov. 24) gives an idea of\r\nthe conditions under which the second edition was prepared: \"This\r\nmorning I heard from Murray that he sold the whole edition[179] the\r\nfirst day to the trade. He wants a new edition instantly, and this\r\nutterly confounds me. Now, under water-cure, with all nervous power\r\ndirected to the skin, I cannot possibly do head-work, and I must make\r\nonly actually necessary corrections. But I will, as far as I can without\r\nmy manuscript, take advantage of your suggestions: I must not attempt\r\nmuch. Will you send me one line to say whether I must strike out about\r\nthe secondary whale,[180] it goes to my heart. About the rattle-snake,\r\nlook to my Journal, under Trigonocephalus, and you will see the probable\r\norigin of the rattle, and generally in transitions it is the _premier\r\npas qui coute_.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows a hint of the coming storm (from a letter to Lyell, Dec.\r\n2):--\r\n\r\n\"Do what I could, I fear I shall be greatly abused. In answer to\r\nSedgwick's remark that my book would be 'mischievous,' I asked him\r\nwhether truth can be known except by being victorious over all attacks.\r\nBut it is no use. H. C. Watson tells me that one zoologist says he will\r\nread my book, 'but I will never believe it.' What a spirit to read any\r\nbook in! Crawford[181] writes to me that his notice will be hostile,\r\nbut that 'he will not calumniate the author.' He says he has read my\r\nbook, 'at least such parts as he could understand.'[182] He sent me some\r\nnotes and suggestions (quite unimportant), and they show me that I have\r\nunavoidably done harm to the subject, by publishing an abstract.... I\r\nhave had several notes from ----, very civil and less decided. Says he\r\nshall not pronounce against me without much reflection, _perhaps will\r\nsay nothing_ on the subject. X. says he will go to that part of hell,\r\nwhich Dante tells us is appointed for those who are neither on God's\r\nside nor on that of the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut his friends were preparing to fight for him. Huxley gave, in\r\n_Macmillan's Magazine_ for December, an analysis of the _Origin_,\r\ntogether with the substance of his Royal Institution lecture, delivered\r\nbefore the publication of the book.\r\n\r\nCarpenter was preparing an essay for the _National Review_, and\r\nnegotiating for a notice in the _Edinburgh_ free from any taint of\r\n_odium theologicum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down [December 12th, 1859].\r\n\r\n... I had very long interviews with ----, which perhaps you would like\r\nto hear about.... I infer from several expressions that, at bottom, he\r\ngoes an immense way with us....\r\n\r\nHe said to the effect that my explanation was the best ever published of\r\nthe manner of formation of species. I said I was very glad to hear it.\r\nHe took me up short: \"You must not at all suppose that I agree with you\r\nin all respects.\" I said I thought it no more likely that I should be\r\nright in nearly all points, than that I should toss up a penny and get\r\nheads twenty times running. I asked him what he thought the weakest\r\npart. He said he had no particular objection to any part. He added:--\r\n\r\n\"If I must criticise, I should say, we do not want to know what Darwin\r\nbelieves and is convinced of, but what he can prove.\" I agreed most\r\nfully and truly that I have probably greatly sinned in this line, and\r\ndefended my general line of argument of inventing a theory and seeing\r\nhow many classes of facts the theory would explain. I added that I would\r\nendeavour to modify the \"believes\" and \"convinceds.\" He took me up\r\nshort: \"You will then spoil your book, the charm of it is that it is\r\nDarwin himself.\" He added another objection, that the book was too\r\n_teres atque rotundus_--that it explained everything, and that it was\r\nimprobable in the highest degree that I should succeed in this. I quite\r\nagree with this rather queer objection, and it comes to this that my\r\nbook must be very bad or very good....\r\n\r\nI have heard, by a roundabout channel, that Herschel says my book \"is\r\nthe law of higgledy-piggledy.\" What this exactly means I do not know,\r\nbut it is evidently very contemptuous. If true this is a great blow and\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_J. D. Hooker to C. Darwin_. Kew [1859].\r\n\r\nDEAR DARWIN,--You have, I know, been drenched with letters since the\r\npublication of your book, and I have hence forborne to add my mite.[183]\r\nI hope now that you are well through Edition II., and I have heard that\r\nyou were flourishing in London. I have not yet got half-through the\r\nbook, not from want of will, but of time--for it is the very hardest\r\nbook to read, to full profits, that I ever tried--it is so cram-full of\r\nmatter and reasoning.[184] I am all the more glad that you have\r\npublished in this form, for the three volumes, unprefaced by this, would\r\nhave choked any Naturalist of the nineteenth century, and certainly have\r\nsoftened my brain in the operation of assimilating their contents. I am\r\nperfectly tired of marvelling at the wonderful amount of facts you have\r\nbrought to bear, and your skill in marshalling them and throwing them on\r\nthe enemy; it is also extremely clear as far as I have gone, but very\r\nhard to fully appreciate. Somehow it reads very different from the MS.,\r\nand I often fancy that I must have been very stupid not to have more\r\nfully followed it in MS. Lyell told me of his criticisms. I did not\r\nappreciate them all, and there are many little matters I hope one day to\r\ntalk over with you. I saw a highly flattering notice in the _English\r\nChurchman_, short and not at all entering into discussion, but praising\r\nyou and your book, and talking patronizingly of the doctrine!... Bentham\r\nand Henslow will still shake their heads, I fancy....\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to T. H. Huxley._ Down, Dec. 28th [1859].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HUXLEY,--Yesterday evening, when I read the _Times_ of a\r\nprevious day, I was amazed to find a splendid essay and review of me.\r\nWho can the author be? I am intensely curious. It included an eulogium\r\nof me which quite touched me, though I am not vain enough to think it\r\nall deserved. The author is a literary man, and German scholar. He has\r\nread my book very attentively; but, what is very remarkable, it seems\r\nthat he is a profound naturalist. He knows my Barnacle-book, and\r\nappreciates it too highly. Lastly, he writes and thinks with quite\r\nuncommon force and clearness; and what is even still rarer, his writing\r\nis seasoned with most pleasant wit. We all laughed heartily over some of\r\nthe sentences.... Who can it be? Certainly I should have said that there\r\nwas only one man in England who could have written this essay, and that\r\n_you_ were the man. But I suppose I am wrong, and that there is some\r\nhidden genius of great calibre. For how could you influence Jupiter\r\nOlympus and make him give three and a half columns to pure science? The\r\nold fogies will think the world will come to an end. Well, whoever the\r\nman is, he has done great service to the cause, far more than by a dozen\r\nreviews in common periodicals. The grand way he soars above common\r\nreligious prejudices, and the admission of such views into the _Times_,\r\nI look at as of the highest importance, quite independently of the mere\r\nquestion of species. If you should happen to be _acquainted_ with the\r\nauthor, for Heaven-sake tell me who he is?\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley, yours most sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this powerful essay, appearing in the leading\r\ndaily Journal, must have had a strong influence on the reading public.\r\nMr. Huxley allows me to quote from a letter an account of the happy\r\nchance that threw into his hands the opportunity of writing it:--\r\n\r\n\"The _Origin_ was sent to Mr. Lucas, one of the staff of the _Times_\r\nwriters at that day, in what I suppose was the ordinary course of\r\nbusiness. Mr. Lucas, though an excellent journalist, and, at a later\r\nperiod, editor of _Once a Week_, was as innocent of any knowledge of\r\nscience as a babe, and bewailed himself to an acquaintance on having to\r\ndeal with such a book. Whereupon he was recommended to ask me to get him\r\nout of his difficulty, and he applied to me accordingly, explaining,\r\nhowever, that it would be necessary for him formally to adopt anything I\r\nmight be disposed to write, by prefacing it with two or three paragraphs\r\nof his own.\r\n\r\n\"I was too anxious to seize upon the opportunity thus offered of giving\r\nthe book a fair chance with the multitudinous readers of the _Times_ to\r\nmake any difficulty about conditions; and being then very full of the\r\nsubject, I wrote the article faster, I think, than I ever wrote anything\r\nin my life, and sent it to Mr. Lucas, who duly prefixed his opening\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\n\"When the article appeared, there was much speculation as to its\r\nauthorship. The secret leaked out in time, as all secrets will, but not\r\nby my aid; and then I used to derive a good deal of innocent amusement\r\nfrom the vehement assertions of some of my more acute friends, that they\r\nknew it was mine from the first paragraph!\r\n\r\n\"As the _Times_ some years since referred to my connection with the\r\nreview, I suppose there will be no breach of confidence in the\r\npublication of this little history, if you think it worth the space it\r\nwill occupy.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] In his next letter to Lyell my father writes: \"The omission of\r\n'living' before 'eminent' naturalists was a dreadful blunder.\" In the\r\nfirst edition, as published, the blunder is corrected by the addition of\r\nthe word \"living.\"\r\n\r\n[164] Darwin wrote to Asa Gray in 1860:--\"The eye to this day gives me a\r\ncold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason\r\ntells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder.\"\r\n\r\n[165] Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz, born at Mortier, on the lake of Morat\r\nin Switzerland, on May 28th, 1807. He emigrated to America in 1846,\r\nwhere he spent the rest of his life, and died Dec. 14th, 1873. His\r\n_Life_, written by his widow, was published in 1885. The following\r\nextract from a letter to Agassiz (1850) is worth giving, as showing how\r\nmy father regarded him, and it may be added that his cordial feeling\r\ntowards the great American naturalist remained strong to the end of his\r\nlife:--\r\n\r\n\"I have seldom been more deeply gratified than by receiving your most\r\nkind present of _Lake Superior_. I had heard of it, and had much wished\r\nto read it, but I confess that it was the very great honour of having in\r\nmy possession a work with your autograph as a presentation copy, that\r\nhas given me such lively and sincere pleasure. I cordially thank you for\r\nit. I have begun to read it with uncommon interest, which I see will\r\nincrease as I go on.\"\r\n\r\n[166] Mr. Wallace was in the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[167] Nov. 19, 1859.\r\n\r\n[168] The Reviewer speaks of the author's \"evident self-satisfaction,\"\r\nand of his disposing of all difficulties \"more or less confidently.\"\r\n\r\n[169] A review of the fourth volume of Watson's _Cybele Britannica_,\r\n_Gard.

Hooker's\r\nhelp is conspicuously acknowledged.\r\n\r\n[171] This refers to the review in the _Athenaeum_, Nov. 19th, 1859,\r\nwhere the reviewer, after touching on the theological aspects of the\r\nbook, leaves the author to \"the mercies of the Divinity Hall, the\r\nCollege, the Lecture Room, and the Museum.\"\r\n\r\n[172] It appears from Sir Charles Lyell's published letters that he\r\nintended to admit the doctrine of evolution in a new edition of the\r\n_Manual_, but this was not published till 1865. He was, however, at work\r\non the _Antiquity of Man_ in 1860, and had already determined to discuss\r\nthe Origin at the end of the book.\r\n\r\n[173] In a letter written in October, my father had said, \"I am\r\nintensely curious to hear Huxley's opinion of my book. I fear my long\r\ndiscussion on classification will disgust him, for it is much opposed to\r\nwhat he once said to me.\" He may have remembered the following incident\r\ntold by Mr. Huxley in his chapter of the _Life and Letters_, ii. p.\r\n196:--\"I remember, in the course of my first interview with Mr. Darwin,\r\nexpressing my belief in the sharpness of the lines of demarcation\r\nbetween natural groups and in the absence of transitional forms, with\r\nall the confidence of youth and imperfect knowledge. I was not aware, at\r\nthat time, that he had then been many years brooding over the species\r\nquestion; and the humorous smile which accompanied his gentle answer,\r\nthat such was not altogether his view, long haunted and puzzled me.\"\r\n\r\n[174] Karl Ernst von Baer, b. 1792, d. at Dorpat 1876--one of the most\r\ndistinguished biologists of the century.

E. Gray of the\r\nBritish Museum attacked me in fine style: 'You have just reproduced\r\nLamarck's doctrine, and nothing else, and here Lyell and others have\r\nbeen attacking him for twenty years, and because _you_ (with a sneer and\r\nlaugh) say the very same thing, they are all coming round; it is the\r\nmost ridiculous inconsistency, &c. &c.'\"\r\n\r\n[183] See, however, p. 211.\r\n\r\n[184] Mr. Huxley has made a similar remark:--\"Long occupation with the\r\nwork has led the present writer to believe that the _Origin of Species_\r\nis one of the hardest of books to master.\"--_Obituary Notice, Proc.

D. to C. Lyell._ Down, January 10th [1860].\r\n\r\n... It is perfectly true that I owe nearly all the corrections to you,\r\nand several verbal ones to you and others; I am heartily glad you\r\napprove of them, as yet only two things have annoyed me; those\r\nconfounded millions[185] of years (not that I think it is probably\r\nwrong), and my not having (by inadvertence) mentioned Wallace towards\r\nthe close of the book in the summary, not that any one has noticed this\r\nto me. I have now put in Wallace's name at p. 484 in a conspicuous\r\nplace. I shall be truly glad to read carefully any MS. on man, and give\r\nmy opinion. You used to caution me to be cautious about man. I suspect I\r\nshall have to return the caution a hundred fold! Yours will, no doubt,\r\nbe a grand discussion; but it will horrify the world at first more than\r\nmy whole volume; although by the sentence (p. 489, new edition[186]) I\r\nshow that I believe man is in the same predicament with other animals.\r\nIt is in fact impossible to doubt it. I have thought (only vaguely) on\r\nman. With respect to the races, one of my best chances of truth has\r\nbroken down from the impossibility of getting facts. I have one good\r\nspeculative line, but a man must have entire credence in Natural\r\nSelection before he will even listen to it. Psychologically, I have done\r\nscarcely anything. Unless, indeed, expression of countenance can be\r\nincluded, and on that subject I have collected a good many facts, and\r\nspeculated, but I do not suppose I shall ever publish, but it is an\r\nuncommonly curious subject.\r\n\r\nA few days later he wrote again to the same correspondent:\r\n\r\n\"What a grand immense benefit you conferred on me by getting Murray to\r\npublish my book. I never till to-day realised that it was getting widely\r\ndistributed; for in a letter from a lady to-day to E., she says she\r\nheard a man enquiring for it at the _Railway Station!!!_ at Waterloo\r\nBridge; and the bookseller said that he had none till the new edition\r\nwas out. The bookseller said he had not read it, but had heard it was a\r\nvery remarkable book!!!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down, 14th [January, 1860].\r\n\r\n... I heard from Lyell this morning, and he tells me a piece of news.\r\nYou are a good-for-nothing man; here you are slaving yourself to death\r\nwith hardly a minute to spare, and you must write a review on my book! I\r\nthought it[187] a very good one, and was so much struck with it, that I\r\nsent it to Lyell. But I assumed, as a matter of course, that it was\r\nLindley's. Now that I know it is yours, I have re-read it, and my kind\r\nand good friend, it has warmed my heart with all the honourable and\r\nnoble things you say of me and it. I was a good deal surprised at\r\nLindley hitting on some of the remarks, but I never dreamed of you. I\r\nadmired it chiefly as so well adapted to tell on the readers of the\r\n_Gardeners' Chronicle_; but now I admire it in another spirit. Farewell,\r\nwith hearty thanks....\r\n\r\n\r\n_Asa Gray to J. D. Hooker._ Cambridge, Mass., January 5th, 1860.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--Your last letter, which reached me just before\r\nChristmas, has got mislaid during the upturnings in my study which take\r\nplace at that season, and has not yet been discovered. I should be very\r\nsorry to lose it, for there were in it some botanical mems. which I had\r\nnot secured....\r\n\r\nThe principal part of your letter was high laudation of Darwin's book.\r\n\r\nWell, the book has reached me, and I finished its careful perusal four\r\ndays ago; and I freely say that your laudation is not out of place.\r\n\r\nIt is done in a _masterly manner_. It might well have taken twenty years\r\nto produce it. It is crammed full of most interesting matter--thoroughly\r\ndigested--well expressed--close, cogent, and taken as a system it makes\r\nout a better case than I had supposed possible....\r\n\r\nAgassiz, when I saw him last, had read but a part of it. He says it is\r\n_poor--very poor_!! (entre nous). The fact [is] he is very much annoyed\r\nby it, ... and I do not wonder at it. To bring all _ideal_ systems\r\nwithin the domain of science, and give good physical or natural\r\nexplanations of all his capital points, is as bad as to have Forbes take\r\nthe glacier materials ... and give scientific explanation of all the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nTell Darwin all this. I will write to him when I get a chance. As I have\r\npromised, he and you shall have fair-play here.... I must myself write a\r\nreview[188] of Darwin's book for _Silliman's Journal_ (the more so that\r\nI suspect Agassiz means to come out upon it) for the next (March)\r\nnumber, and I am now setting about it (when I ought to be every moment\r\nworking the Expl[oring] Expedition Compositae, which I know far more\r\nabout). And really it is no easy job as you may well imagine.\r\n\r\nI doubt if I shall please you altogether. I know I shall not please\r\nAgassiz at all. I hear another reprint is in the Press, and the book\r\nwill excite much attention here, and some controversy....\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Asa Gray._ Down, January 28th [1860].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GRAY,--Hooker has forwarded to me your letter to him; and I\r\ncannot express how deeply it has gratified me. To receive the approval\r\nof a man whom one has long sincerely respected, and whose judgment and\r\nknowledge are most universally admitted, is the highest reward an author\r\ncan possibly wish for; and I thank you heartily for your most kind\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nI have been absent from home for a few days, and so could not earlier\r\nanswer your letter to me of the 10th of January. You have been extremely\r\nkind to take so much trouble and interest about the edition. It has been\r\na mistake of my publisher not thinking of sending over the sheets. I had\r\nentirely and utterly forgotten your offer of receiving the sheets as\r\nprinted off. But I must not blame my publisher, for had I remembered\r\nyour most kind offer I feel pretty sure I should not have taken\r\nadvantage of it; for I never dreamed of my book being so successful with\r\ngeneral readers: I believe I should have laughed at the idea of sending\r\nthe sheets to America.[189]\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration, and on the strong advice of Lyell and others,\r\nI have resolved to leave the present book as it is (excepting correcting\r\nerrors, or here and there inserting short sentences), and to use all my\r\nstrength, _which is but little_, to bring out the first part (forming a\r\nseparate volume, with index, &c.) of the three volumes which will make\r\nmy bigger work; so that I am very unwilling to take up time in making\r\ncorrections for an American edition. I enclose a list of a few\r\ncorrections in the second reprint, which you will have received by this\r\ntime complete, and I could send four or five corrections or additions of\r\nequally small importance, or rather of equal brevity. I also intend to\r\nwrite a _short_ preface with a brief history of the subject. These I\r\nwill set about, as they must some day be done, and I will send them to\r\nyou in a short time--the few corrections first, and the preface\r\nafterwards, unless I hear that you have given up all idea of a separate\r\nedition. You will then be able to judge whether it is worth having the\r\nnew edition with _your review prefixed_. Whatever be the nature of your\r\nreview, I assure you I should feel it a _great_ honour to have my book\r\nthus preceded....\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down [February 15th, 1860].\r\n\r\n... I am perfectly convinced (having read it this morning) that the\r\nreview in the _Annals_[190] is by Wollaston; no one else in the world\r\nwould have used so many parentheses. I have written to him, and told him\r\nthat the \"pestilent\" fellow thanks him for his kind manner of speaking\r\nabout him. I have also told him that he would be pleased to hear that\r\nthe Bishop of Oxford says it is the most unphilosophical[191] work he\r\never read. The review seems to me clever, and only misinterprets me in a\r\nfew places. Like all hostile men, he passes over the explanation given\r\nof Classification, Morphology, Embryology, and Rudimentary Organs, &c. I\r\nread Wallace's paper in MS.,[192] and thought it admirably good; he does\r\nnot know that he has been anticipated about the depth of intervening sea\r\ndetermining distribution.... The most curious point in the paper seems\r\nto me that about the African character of the Celebes productions, but I\r\nshould require further confirmation....\r\n\r\nHenslow is staying here; I have had some talk with him; he is in much\r\nthe same state as Bunbury,[193] and will go a very little way with us,\r\nbut brings up no real argument against going further. He also shudders\r\nat the eye! It is really curious (and perhaps is an argument in our\r\nfavour) how differently different opposers view the subject. Henslow\r\nused to rest his opposition on the imperfection of the Geological\r\nRecord, but he now thinks nothing of this, and says I have got well out\r\nof it; I wish I could quite agree with him. Baden Powell says he never\r\nread anything so conclusive as my statement about the eye!! A stranger\r\nwrites to me about sexual selection, and regrets that I boggle about\r\nsuch a trifle as the brush of hair on the male turkey, and so on. As L.\r\nJenyns has a really philosophical mind, and as you say you like to see\r\neverything, I send an old letter of his. In a later letter to Henslow,\r\nwhich I have seen, he is more candid than any opposer I have heard of,\r\nfor he says, though he cannot go so far as I do, yet he can give no good\r\nreason why he should not. It is funny how each man draws his own\r\nimaginary line at which to halt. It reminds me so vividly [of] what I\r\nwas told[194] about you when I first commenced geology--to believe a\r\n_little_, but on no account to believe all.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the attitude of the more liberal representatives of the\r\nChurch, the following letter from Charles Kingsley is of interest:\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. Kingsley to C. Darwin._ Eversley Rectory, Winchfield,\r\nNovember 18th, 1859.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to thank you for the unexpected honour of your book.\r\nThat the Naturalist whom, of all naturalists living, I most wish to know\r\nand to learn from, should have sent a scientist like me his book,\r\nencourages me at least to observe more carefully, and think more slowly.\r\n\r\nI am so poorly (in brain), that I fear I cannot read your book just now\r\nas I ought. All I have seen of it _awes_ me; both with the heap of facts\r\nand the prestige of your name, and also with the clear intuition, that\r\nif you be right, I must give up much that I have believed and written.\r\n\r\nIn that I care little. Let God be true, and every man a liar! Let us\r\nknow what is, and, as old Socrates has it, [Greek: hepesthai to\r\nlogo]--follow up the villainous shifty fox of an argument, into\r\nwhatsoever unexpected bogs and brakes he may lead us, if we do but run\r\ninto him at last.\r\n\r\nFrom two common superstitious, at least, I shall be free while judging\r\nof your book:--\r\n\r\n(1.) I have long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated\r\nanimals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n(2.) I have gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a\r\nconception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of\r\nself-development into all forms needful _pro tempore_ and _pro loco_, as\r\nto believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the\r\n_lacunas_ which He Himself had made. I question whether the former be\r\nnot the loftier thought.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, I shall prize your book, both for itself, and as a\r\nproof that you are aware of the existence of such a person as\r\n\r\nYour faithful servant,\r\nC. KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father's old friend, the Rev. J. Brodie Innes, of Milton Brodie, who\r\nwas for many years Vicar of Down, in some reminiscences of my father\r\nwhich he was so good as to give me, writes in the same spirit:\r\n\r\n\"We never attacked each other. Before I knew Mr. Darwin I had adopted,\r\nand publicly expressed, the principle that the study of natural history,\r\ngeology, and science in general, should be pursued without reference to\r\nthe Bible. That the Book of Nature and Scripture came from the same\r\nDivine source, ran in parallel lines, and when properly understood would\r\nnever cross....\r\n\r\n\"In [a] letter, after I had left Down, he [Darwin] writes, 'We often\r\ndiffered, but you are one of those rare mortals from whom one can differ\r\nand yet feel no shade of animosity, and that is a thing [of] which I\r\nshould feel very proud if any one could say [it] of me.'\r\n\r\n\"On my last visit to Down, Mr. Darwin said, at his dinner-table, 'Innes\r\nand I have been fast friends for thirty years, and we never thoroughly\r\nagreed on any subject but once, and then we stared hard at each other,\r\nand thought one of us must be very ill.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter to Lyell, Feb. 23, 1860, has a\r\ncertain bearing on the points just touched on:\r\n\r\n\"With respect to Bronn's[195] objection that it cannot be shown how life\r\narises, and likewise to a certain extent Asa Gray's remark that natural\r\nselection is not a _vera causa_, I was much interested by finding\r\naccidentally in Brewster's _Life of Newton_, that Leibnitz objected to\r\nthe law of gravity because Newton could not show what gravity itself is.\r\nAs it has chanced, I have used in letters this very same argument,\r\nlittle knowing that any one had really thus objected to the law of\r\ngravity. Newton answers by saying that it is philosophy to make out the\r\nmovements of a clock, though you do not know why the weight descends to\r\nthe ground. Leibnitz further objected that the law of gravity was\r\nopposed to Natural Religion! Is this not curious? I really think I shall\r\nuse the facts for some introductory remarks for my bigger book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down, March 3rd [1860].\r\n\r\n... I think you expect too much in regard to change of opinion on the\r\nsubject of Species. One large class of men, more especially I suspect of\r\nnaturalists, never will care about _any_ general question, of which old\r\nGray, of the British Museum, may be taken as a type; and secondly,\r\nnearly all men past a moderate age, either in actual years or in mind\r\nare, I am fully convinced, incapable of looking at facts under a new\r\npoint of view. Seriously, I am astonished and rejoiced at the progress\r\nwhich the subject has made; look at the enclosed memorandum. ---- says\r\nmy book will be forgotten in ten years, perhaps so; but, with such a\r\nlist, I feel convinced the subject will not.\r\n\r\n[Here follows the memorandum referred to:]\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGeologists.       | Zoologists and   |  Physiologists.  |Botanists.\r\n                  | Palaeontologists.|                  |\r\n------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------\r\nLyell.            |Huxley.           |Carpenter.        |Hooker.\r\nRamsay.[196]      |J.

D. to Asa Gray_. Down, April 3 [1860].\r\n\r\n... I remember well the time when the thought of the eye made me cold\r\nall over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, and now small\r\ntrifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The\r\nsight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me\r\nsick!...\r\n\r\nYou may like to hear about reviews on my book. Sedgwick (as I and Lyell\r\nfeel _certain_ from internal evidence) has reviewed me savagely and\r\nunfairly in the _Spectator_.[201] The notice includes much abuse, and is\r\nhardly fair in several respects. He would actually lead any one, who was\r\nignorant of geology, to suppose that I had invented the great gaps\r\nbetween successive geological formations, instead of its being an almost\r\nuniversally admitted dogma. But my dear old friend Sedgwick, with his\r\nnoble heart, is old, and is rabid with indignation.... There has been\r\none prodigy of a review, namely, an _opposed_ one (by Pictet,[202] the\r\npalaeontologist, in the _Bib. Universelle_ of Geneva) which is\r\n_perfectly_ fair and just, and I agree to every word he says; our only\r\ndifference being that he attaches less weight to arguments in favour,\r\nand more to arguments opposed, than I do. Of all the opposed reviews, I\r\nthink this the only quite fair one, and I never expected to see one.\r\nPlease observe that I do not class your review by any means as opposed,\r\nthough you think so yourself! It has done me _much_ too good service\r\never to appear in that rank in my eyes. But I fear I shall weary you\r\nwith so much about my book. I should rather think there was a good\r\nchance of my becoming the most egotistical man in all Europe! What a\r\nproud pre-eminence! Well, you have helped to make me so, and therefore\r\nyou must forgive me if you can.\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray, ever yours most gratefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down, April 10th [1860].\r\n\r\nI have just read the _Edinburgh_,[203] which without doubt is by ----.\r\nIt is extremely malignant, clever, and I fear will be very damaging. He\r\nis atrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, and very bitter against\r\nHooker. So we three _enjoyed_ it together. Not that I really enjoyed it,\r\nfor it made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it\r\nto-day. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter spite of\r\nmany of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself. It\r\nscandalously misrepresents many parts. He misquotes some passages,\r\naltering words within inverted commas....\r\n\r\nIt is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which ---- hates\r\nme.\r\n\r\nNow for a curious thing about my book, and then I have done. In last\r\nSaturday's _Gardeners' Chronicle_,[204] a Mr. Patrick Matthew publishes\r\na long extract from his work on _Naval Timber and Arboriculture_\r\npublished in 1831, in which he briefly but completely anticipates the\r\ntheory of Natural Selection. I have ordered the book, as some few\r\npassages are rather obscure, but it is certainly, I think, a complete\r\nbut not developed anticipation! Erasmus always said that surely this\r\nwould be shown to be the case some day. Anyhow, one may be excused in\r\nnot having discovered the fact in a work on Naval Timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down [April 13th, 1860].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--Questions of priority so often lead to odious quarrels,\r\nthat I should esteem it a great favour if you would read the\r\nenclosed.[205] If you think it proper that I should send it (and of\r\nthis there can hardly be any question), and if you think it full and\r\nample enough, please alter the date to the day on which you post it, and\r\nlet that be soon. The case in the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ seems a\r\n_little_ stronger than in Mr. Matthew's book, for the passages are\r\ntherein scattered in three places; but it would be mere hair-splitting\r\nto notice that. If you object to my letter, please return it; but I do\r\nnot expect that you will, but I thought that you would not object to run\r\nyour eye over it. My dear Hooker, it is a great thing for me to have so\r\ngood, true, and old a friend as you. I owe much for science to my\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n... I have gone over [the _Edinburgh_] review again, and compared\r\npassages, and I am astonished at the misrepresentations. But I am glad I\r\nresolved not to answer. Perhaps it is selfish, but to answer and think\r\nmore on the subject is too unpleasant. I am so sorry that Huxley by my\r\nmeans has been thus atrociously attacked. I do not suppose you much care\r\nabout the gratuitous attack on you.\r\n\r\nLyell in his letter remarked that you seemed to him as if you were\r\noverworked. Do, pray, be cautious, and remember how many and many a man\r\nhas done this--who thought it absurd till too late. I have often thought\r\nthe same. You know that you were bad enough before your Indian journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell._ Down, April [1860].\r\n\r\n... I was particularly glad to hear what you thought about not noticing\r\n[the _Edinburgh_] review. Hooker and Huxley thought it a sort of duty to\r\npoint out the alteration of quoted citations, and there is truth in this\r\nremark; but I so hated the thought that I resolved not to do so. I shall\r\ncome up to London on Saturday the 14th, for Sir B. Brodie's party, as I\r\nhave an accumulation of things to do in London, and will (if I do not\r\nhear to the contrary) call about a quarter before ten on Sunday morning,\r\nand sit with you at breakfast, but will not sit long, and so take up\r\nmuch of your time. I must say one more word about our quasi-theological\r\ncontroversy about natural selection, and let me have your opinion when\r\nwe meet in London. Do you consider that the successive variations in the\r\nsize of the crop of the Pouter Pigeon, which man has accumulated to\r\nplease his caprice, have been due to \"the creative and sustaining powers\r\nof Brahma?\" In the sense that an omnipotent and omniscient Deity must\r\norder and know everything, this must be admitted; yet, in honest truth,\r\nI can hardly admit it. It seems preposterous that a maker of a universe\r\nshould care about the crop of a pigeon solely to please man's silly\r\nfancies. But if you agree with me in thinking such an interposition of\r\nthe Deity uncalled for, I can see no reason whatever for believing in\r\nsuch interpositions in the case of natural beings, in which strange and\r\nadmirable peculiarities have been naturally selected for the creature's\r\nown benefit. Imagine a Pouter in a state of nature wading into the water\r\nand then, being buoyed up by its inflated crop, sailing about in search\r\nof food. What admiration this would have excited--adaptation to the laws\r\nof hydrostatic pressure, &c. &c. For the life of me, I cannot see any\r\ndifficulty in natural selection producing the most exquisite structure,\r\n_if such structure can be arrived at by gradation_, and I know from\r\nexperience how hard it is to name any structure towards which at least\r\nsome gradations are not known.\r\n\r\nEver yours.\r\n\r\nP.S.--The conclusion at which I have come, as I have told Asa Gray, is\r\nthat such a question, as is touched on in this note, is beyond the human\r\nintellect, like \"predestination and free will,\" or the \"origin of evil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down [May 15th, 1860].\r\n\r\n... How paltry it is in such men as X., Y. and Co. not reading your\r\nessay. It is incredibly paltry. They may all attack me to their hearts'\r\ncontent. I am got case-hardened. As for the old fogies in\r\nCambridge,[206] it really signifies nothing. I look at their attacks as\r\na proof that our work is worth the doing. It makes me resolve to buckle\r\non my armour. I see plainly that it will be a long uphill fight. But\r\nthink of Lyell's progress with Geology. One thing I see most plainly,\r\nthat without Lyell's, yours, Huxley's and Carpenter's aid, my book would\r\nhave been a mere flash in the pan. But if we all stick to it, we shall\r\nsurely gain the day. And I now see that the battle is worth fighting. I\r\ndeeply hope that you think so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Asa Gray._ Down May 22nd [1860].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GRAY,--Again I have to thank you for one of your very pleasant\r\nletters of May 7th, enclosing a very pleasant remittance of L22. I am in\r\nsimple truth astonished at all the kind trouble you have taken for me. I\r\nreturn Appletons' account. For the chance of your wishing for a formal\r\nacknowledgment I send one. If you have any further communication to the\r\nAppletons, pray express my acknowledgment for [their] generosity; for it\r\nis generosity in my opinion. I am not at all surprised at the sale\r\ndiminishing; my extreme surprise is at the greatness of the sale. No\r\ndoubt the public has been _shamefully_ imposed on! for they bought the\r\nbook thinking that it would be nice easy reading. I expect the sale to\r\nstop soon in England, yet Lyell wrote to me the other day that calling\r\nat Murray's he heard that fifty copies had gone in the previous\r\nforty-eight hours. I am extremely glad that you will notice in\r\n_Silliman_ the additions in the _Origin_.[207] Judging from letters (and\r\nI have just seen one from Thwaites to Hooker), and from remarks, the\r\nmost serious omission in my book was not explaining how it is, as I\r\nbelieve, that all forms do not necessarily advance, how there can now be\r\n_simple_ organisms still existing.... I hear there is a _very_ severe\r\nreview on me in the _North British_ by a Rev. Mr. Dunns,[208] a Free\r\nKirk minister, and dabbler in Natural History. In the _Saturday Review_\r\n(one of our cleverest periodicals) of May 5th, p. 573, there is a nice\r\narticle on [the _Edinburgh_] review, defending Huxley, but not Hooker;\r\nand the latter, I think, [the _Edinburgh_ reviewer] treats most\r\nungenerously.[209] But surely you will get sick unto death of me and my\r\nreviewers.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the theological view of the question. This is always\r\npainful to me. I am bewildered. I had no intention to write\r\natheistically. But I own that I cannot see as plainly as others do, and\r\nas I should wish to do, evidence of design and beneficence on all sides\r\nof us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade\r\nmyself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly\r\ncreated the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding\r\nwithin the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with\r\nmice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye\r\nwas expressly designed. On the other hand, I cannot anyhow be contented\r\nto view this wonderful universe, and especially the nature of man, and\r\nto conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined\r\nto look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details,\r\nwhether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance.\r\nNot that this notion _at all_ satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the\r\nwhole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as\r\nwell speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and believe what\r\nhe can. Certainly I agree with you that my views are not at all\r\nnecessarily atheistical. The lightning kills a man, whether a good one\r\nor bad one, owing to the excessively complex action of natural laws. A\r\nchild (who may turn out an idiot) is born by the action of even more\r\ncomplex laws, and I can see no reason why a man, or other animal, may\r\nnot have been aboriginally produced by other laws, and that all these\r\nlaws may have been expressly designed by an omniscient Creator, who\r\nforesaw every future event and consequence. But the more I think the\r\nmore bewildered I become; as indeed I have probably shown by this\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nMost deeply do I feel your generous kindness and interest.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely and cordially.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the British Association at Oxford in 1860 is famous for\r\ntwo pitched battles over the _Origin of Species_. Both of them\r\noriginated in unimportant papers. On Thursday, June 28th, Dr. Daubeny\r\nof Oxford made a communication to Section D: \"On the final causes of the\r\nsexuality of plants, with particular reference to Mr. Darwin's work on\r\nthe _Origin of Species_.\" Mr. Huxley was called on by the President, but\r\ntried (according to the _Athenaeum_ report) to avoid a discussion, on the\r\nground \"that a general audience, in which sentiment would unduly\r\ninterfere with intellect, was not the public before which such a\r\ndiscussion should be carried on.\" However, the subject was not allowed\r\nto drop. Sir R. Owen (I quote from the _Athenaeum_, July 7th, 1860), who\r\n\"wished to approach this subject in the spirit of the philosopher,\"\r\nexpressed his \"conviction that there were facts by which the public\r\ncould come to some conclusion with regard to the probabilities of the\r\ntruth of Mr. Darwin's theory.\" He went on to say that the brain of the\r\ngorilla \"presented more differences, as compared with the brain of man,\r\nthan it did when compared with the brains of the very lowest and most\r\nproblematical of the Quadrumana.\" Mr. Huxley replied, and gave these\r\nassertions a \"direct and unqualified contradiction,\" pledging himself to\r\n\"justify that unusual procedure elsewhere,\"[210] a pledge which he amply\r\nfulfilled.[211] On Friday there was peace, but on Saturday 30th, the\r\nbattle arose with redoubled fury, at a conjoint meeting of three\r\nSections, over a paper by Dr. Draper of New York, on the \"Intellectual\r\ndevelopment of Europe considered with reference to the views of Mr.\r\nDarwin.\"\r\n\r\nThe following account is from an eye-witness of the scene.\r\n\r\n\"The excitement was tremendous. The Lecture-room, in which it had been\r\narranged that the discussion should be held, proved far too small for\r\nthe audience, and the meeting adjourned to the Library of the Museum,\r\nwhich was crammed to suffocation long before the champions entered the\r\nlists. The numbers were estimated at from 700 to 1000. Had it been\r\nterm-time, or had the general public been admitted, it would have been\r\nimpossible to have accommodated the rush to hear the oratory of the bold\r\nBishop.[212] Professor Henslow, the President of Section D, occupied the\r\nchair, and wisely announced _in limine_ that none who had not valid\r\narguments to bring forward on one side or the other, would be allowed to\r\naddress the meeting: a caution that proved necessary, for no fewer than\r\nfour combatants had their utterances burked by him, because of their\r\nindulgence in vague declamation.\r\n\r\n\"The Bishop was up to time, and spoke for full half-an-hour with\r\ninimitable spirit, emptiness and unfairness. It was evident from his\r\nhandling of the subject that he had been 'crammed' up to the throat, and\r\nthat he knew nothing at first hand; in fact, he used no argument not to\r\nbe found in his _Quarterly_ article.[213] He ridiculed Darwin badly, and\r\nHuxley savagely, but all in such dulcet tones, so persuasive a manner,\r\nand in such well-turned periods, that I who had been inclined to blame\r\nthe President for allowing a discussion that could serve no scientific\r\npurpose, now forgave him from the bottom of my heart.\"\r\n\r\nWhat follows is from notes most kindly supplied by the Hon. and Rev. W.\r\nH. Fremantle, who was an eye-witness of the scene.\r\n\r\n\"The Bishop of Oxford attacked Darwin, at first playfully but at last in\r\ngrim earnest. It was known that the Bishop had written an article\r\nagainst Darwin in the last _Quarterly Review_: it was also rumoured that\r\nProfessor Owen had been staying at Cuddesden and had primed the Bishop,\r\nwho was to act as mouthpiece to the great Palaeontologist, who did not\r\nhimself dare to enter the lists. The Bishop, however, did not show\r\nhimself master of the facts, and made one serious blunder. A fact which\r\nhad been much dwelt on as confirmatory of Darwin's idea of variation,\r\nwas that a sheep had been born shortly before in a flock in the North of\r\nEngland, having an addition of one to the vertebrae of the spine. The\r\nBishop was declaring with rhetorical exaggeration that there was hardly\r\nany actual evidence on Darwin's side. 'What have they to bring forward?'\r\nhe exclaimed. 'Some rumoured statement about a long-legged sheep.' But\r\nhe passed on to banter: 'I should like to ask Professor Huxley, who is\r\nsitting by me, and is about to tear me to pieces when I have sat down,\r\nas to his belief in being descended from an ape. Is it on his\r\ngrandfather's or his grandmother's side that the ape ancestry comes in?'\r\nAnd then taking a graver tone, he asserted in a solemn peroration that\r\nDarwin's views were contrary to the revelations of God in the\r\nScriptures. Professor Huxley was unwilling to respond: but he was called\r\nfor and spoke with his usual incisiveness and with some scorn. 'I am\r\nhere only in the interests of science,' he said, 'and I have not heard\r\nanything which can prejudice the case of my august client.' Then after\r\nshowing how little competent the Bishop was to enter upon the\r\ndiscussion, he touched on the question of Creation. 'You say that\r\ndevelopment drives out the Creator. But you assert that God made you:\r\nand yet you know that you yourself were originally a little piece of\r\nmatter no bigger than the end of this gold pencil-case.' Lastly as to\r\nthe descent from a monkey, he said: 'I should feel it no shame to have\r\nrisen from such an origin. But I should feel it a shame to have sprung\r\nfrom one who prostituted the gifts of culture and of eloquence to the\r\nservice of prejudice and of falsehood.'\r\n\r\n\"Many others spoke. Mr. Gresley, an old Oxford don, pointed out that in\r\nhuman nature at least orderly development was not the necessary rule;\r\nHomer was the greatest of poets, but he lived 3000 years ago, and has\r\nnot produced his like.\r\n\r\n\"Admiral Fitz-Roy was present, and said that he had often expostulated\r\nwith his old comrade of the _Beagle_ for entertaining views which were\r\ncontradictory to the First Chapter of Genesis.\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Lubbock declared that many of the arguments by which the\r\npermanence of species was supported came to nothing, and instanced some\r\nwheat which was said to have come off an Egyptian mummy and was sent to\r\nhim to prove that wheat had not changed since the time of the Pharaohs;\r\nbut which proved to be made of French chocolate.[214] Sir Joseph (then\r\nDr.) Hooker spoke shortly, saying that he had found the hypothesis of\r\nNatural Selection so helpful in explaining the phenomena of his own\r\nsubject of Botany, that he had been constrained to accept it. After a\r\nfew words from Darwin's old friend Professor Henslow who occupied the\r\nchair, the meeting broke up, leaving the impression that those most\r\ncapable of estimating the arguments of Darwin in detail saw their way to\r\naccept his conclusions.\"\r\n\r\nMany versions of Mr. Huxley's speech were current: the following report\r\nof his conclusion is from a letter addressed by the late John Richard\r\nGreen, then an undergraduate, to a fellow-student, now Professor Boyd\r\nDawkins:--\"I asserted, and I repeat, that a man has no reason to be\r\nashamed of having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor\r\nwhom I should feel shame in recalling, it would be a _man_, a man of\r\nrestless and versatile intellect, who, not content with an equivocal\r\nsuccess in his own sphere of activity, plunges into scientific questions\r\nwith which he has no real acquaintance, only to obscure them by an\r\naimless rhetoric, and distract the attention of his hearers from the\r\nreal point at issue by eloquent digressions, and skilled appeals to\r\nreligious prejudice.\"[215]\r\n\r\nThe following letter shows that Mr. Huxley's presence at this\r\nremarkable scene depended on so slight a chance as that of meeting a\r\nfriend in the street; that this friend should have been Robert Chambers,\r\nso that the author of the _Vestiges_ should have sounded the war-note\r\nfor the battle of the _Origin_, adds interest to the incident. I have to\r\nthank Mr. Huxley for allowing the story to be told in words of his not\r\nwritten for publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n_T. H. Huxley to Francis Darwin._\r\n\r\nJune 27, 1891.\r\n\r\n... I should say that Fremantle's account is substantially correct; but\r\nthat Green has the passage of my speech more accurately. However, I am\r\ncertain I did not use the word \"equivocal.\"[216]\r\n\r\nThe odd part of the business is that I should not have been present\r\nexcept for Robert Chambers. I had heard of the Bishop's intention to\r\nutilise the occasion. I knew he had the reputation of being a first-rate\r\ncontroversialist, and I was quite aware that if he played his cards\r\nproperly, we should have little chance, with such an audience, of making\r\nan efficient defence. Moreover, I was very tired, and wanted to join my\r\nwife at her brother-in-law's country house near Reading, on the\r\nSaturday. On the Friday I met Chambers in the street, and in reply to\r\nsome remark of his about the meeting, I said that I did not mean to\r\nattend it; did not see the good of giving up peace and quietness to be\r\nepiscopally pounded. Chambers broke out into vehement remonstrances and\r\ntalked about my deserting them. So I said, \"Oh! if you take it that way,\r\nI'll come and have my share of what is going on.\"\r\n\r\nSo I came, and chanced to sit near old Sir Benjamin Brodie. The Bishop\r\nbegan his speech, and, to my astonishment, very soon showed that he was\r\nso ignorant that he did not know how to manage his own case. My spirits\r\nrose proportionally, and when he turned to me with his insolent\r\nquestion, I said to Sir Benjamin, in an undertone, \"The Lord hath\r\ndelivered him into mine hands.\"\r\n\r\nThat sagacious old gentleman stared at me as if I had lost my senses.\r\nBut, in fact, the Bishop had justified the severest retort I could\r\ndevise, and I made up my mind to let him have it. I was careful,\r\nhowever, not to rise to reply, until the meeting called for me--then I\r\nlet myself go.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the Bishop, I am bound to say he bore no malice, but was\r\nalways courtesy itself when we occasionally met in after years. Hooker\r\nand I walked away from the meeting together, and I remember saying to\r\nhim that this experience had changed my opinion as to the practical\r\nvalue of the art of public speaking, and that, from that time forth, I\r\nshould carefully cultivate it, and try to leave off hating it. I did the\r\nformer, but never quite succeeded in the latter effort.\r\n\r\nI did not mean to trouble you with such a long scrawl when I began about\r\nthis piece of ancient history.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully\r\nT. H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eye-witness above quoted (p. 237) continues:--\r\n\r\n\"There was a crowded conversazione in the evening at the rooms of the\r\nhospitable and genial Professor of Botany, Dr. Daubeny, where the almost\r\nsole topic was the battle of the _Origin_, and I was much struck with\r\nthe fair and unprejudiced way in which the black coats and white cravats\r\nof Oxford discussed the question, and the frankness with which they\r\noffered their congratulations to the winners in the combat.\"[217]\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Monday night [July 2nd, 1860].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--I have just received your letter. I have been very\r\npoorly, with almost continuous bad headache for forty-eight hours, and I\r\nwas low enough, and thinking what a useless burthen I was to myself and\r\nall others, when your letter came, and it has so cheered me; your\r\nkindness and affection brought tears into my eyes. Talk of fame, honour,\r\npleasure, wealth, all are dirt compared with affection; and this is a\r\ndoctrine with which, I know, from your letter, that you will agree with\r\nfrom the bottom of your heart.... How I should have liked to have\r\nwandered about Oxford with you, if I had been well enough; and how still\r\nmore I should have liked to have heard you triumphing over the Bishop. I\r\nam astonished at your success and audacity. It is something\r\nunintelligible to me how any one can argue in public like orators do. I\r\nhad no idea you had this power. I have read lately so many hostile\r\nviews, that I was beginning to think that perhaps I was wholly in the\r\nwrong, and that ---- was right when he said the whole subject would be\r\nforgotten in ten years; but now that I hear that you and Huxley will\r\nfight publicly (which I am sure I never could do), I fully believe that\r\nour cause will, in the long-run, prevail. I am glad I was not in Oxford,\r\nfor I should have been overwhelmed, with my [health] in its present\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ [July 1860.]\r\n\r\n... I have just read the _Quarterly_.[218] It is uncommonly clever; it\r\npicks out with skill all the most conjectural parts, and brings forward\r\nwell all the difficulties. It quizzes me quite splendidly by quoting the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_ versus my Grandfather. You are not alluded to, nor,\r\nstrange to say, Huxley; and I can plainly see, here and there, ----'s\r\nhand. The concluding pages will make Lyell shake in his shoes. By Jove,\r\nif he sticks to us, he will be a real hero. Good-night. Your\r\nwell-quizzed, but not sorrowful, and affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nC. D.\r\n\r\nI can see there has been some queer tampering with the review, for a\r\npage has been cut out and reprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter of Sept. 1st, 1860, is of interest,\r\nnot only as showing that Lyell was still conscientiously working out his\r\nconversion, but also and especially as illustrating the remarkable fact\r\nthat hardly any of my father's critics gave him any new objections--so\r\nfruitful had been his ponderings of twenty years:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been much interested by your letter of the 28th, received this\r\nmorning. It has _delighted_ me, because it demonstrates that you have\r\nthought a good deal lately on Natural Selection. Few things have\r\nsurprised me more than the entire paucity of objections and difficulties\r\nnew to me in the published reviews. Your remarks are of a different\r\nstamp and new to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Asa Gray._ [Hartfield, Sussex] July 22nd [1860].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GRAY,--Owing to absence from home at water-cure and then having\r\nto move my sick girl to whence I am now writing, I have only lately read\r\nthe discussion in _Proc. American Acad._,[219] and now I cannot resist\r\nexpressing my sincere admiration of your most clear powers of reasoning.\r\nAs Hooker lately said in a note to me, you are more than _any one_ else\r\nthe thorough master of the subject. I declare that you know my book as\r\nwell as I do myself; and bring to the question new lines of illustration\r\nand argument in a manner which excites my astonishment and almost my\r\nenvy![220] I admire these discussions, I think, almost more than your\r\narticle in _Silliman's Journal_. Every single word seems weighed\r\ncarefully, and tells like a 32-pound shot. It makes me much wish (but I\r\nknow that you have not time) that you could write more in detail, and\r\ngive, for instance, the facts on the variability of the American wild\r\nfruits. The _Athenaeum_ has the largest circulation, and I have sent my\r\ncopy to the editor with a request that he would republish the first\r\ndiscussion; I much fear he will not, as he reviewed the subject in so\r\nhostile a spirit.... I shall be curious [to see], and will order the\r\nAugust number, as soon as I know that it contains your review of\r\nreviews. My conclusion is that you have made a mistake in being a\r\nbotanist, you ought to have been a lawyer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following passages from a letter to Huxley (Dec. 2nd, 1860) may\r\nserve to show what was my father's view of the position of the subject,\r\nafter a year's experience of reviewers, critics and converts:--\r\n\r\n\"I have got fairly sick of hostile reviews. Nevertheless, they have been\r\nof use in showing me when to expatiate a little and to introduce a few\r\nnew discussions.\r\n\r\n\"I entirely agree with you, that the difficulties on my notions are\r\nterrific, yet having seen what all the Reviews have said against me, I\r\nhave far more confidence in the _general_ truth of the doctrine than I\r\nformerly had. Another thing gives me confidence, viz. that some who went\r\nhalf an inch with me now go further, and some who were bitterly opposed\r\nare now less bitterly opposed.... I can pretty plainly see that, if my\r\nview is ever to be generally adopted, it will be by young men growing up\r\nand replacing the old workers, and then young ones finding that they can\r\ngroup facts and search out new lines of investigation better on the\r\nnotion of descent, than on that of creation.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[185] This refers to the passage in the _Origin of Species_ (2nd edit.\r\np. 285) in which the lapse of time implied by the denudation of the\r\nWeald is discussed. The discussion closes with the sentence: \"So that it\r\nis not improbable that a longer period than 300 million years has\r\nelapsed since the latter part of the Secondary period.\" This passage is\r\nomitted in the later editions of the _Origin_, against the advice of\r\nsome of his friends, as appears from the pencil notes in my father's\r\ncopy of the 2nd edition.\r\n\r\n[186] In the first edition, the passages occur on p. 488.\r\n\r\n[187] _Gardeners' Chronicle_, 1860. Sir J. D. Hooker took the line of\r\ncomplete impartiality, so as not to commit the editor, Lindley.\r\n\r\n[188] On Jan. 23 Gray wrote to Darwin: \"It naturally happens that my\r\nreview of your book does not exhibit anything like the full force of the\r\nimpression the book has made upon me. Under the circumstances I suppose\r\nI do your theory more good here, by bespeaking for it a fair and\r\nfavourable consideration, and by standing non-committed as to its full\r\nconclusions, than I should if I announced myself a convert; nor could I\r\nsay the latter, with truth....\r\n\r\n\"What seems to me the weakest point in the book is the attempt to\r\naccount for the formation of organs, the making of eyes, &c., by natural\r\nselection. Some of this reads quite Lamarckian.\"\r\n\r\n[189] In a letter to Mr. Murray, 1860, my father wrote:--\"I am amused by\r\nAsa Gray's account of the excitement my book has made amongst\r\nnaturalists in the U. States. Agassiz has denounced it in a newspaper,\r\nbut yet in such terms that it is in fact a fine advertisement!\" This\r\nseems to refer to a lecture given before the Mercantile Library\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n[190] _Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist._ third series, vol. v. p. 132. My\r\nfather has obviously taken the expression \"pestilent\" from the following\r\npassage (p. 138): \"But who is this Nature, we have a right to ask, who\r\nhas such tremendous power, and to whose efficiency such marvellous\r\nperformances are ascribed? What are her image and attributes, when\r\ndragged from her wordy lurking-place? Is she ought but a pestilent\r\nabstraction, like dust cast in our eyes to obscure the workings of an\r\nIntelligent First Cause of all?\" The reviewer pays a tribute to my\r\nfather's candour \"so manly and outspoken as almost to 'cover a multitude\r\nof sins.'\" The parentheses (to which allusion is made above) are so\r\nfrequent as to give a characteristic appearance to Mr. Wollaston's\r\npages.\r\n\r\n[191] Another version of the words is given by Lyell, to whom they were\r\nspoken, viz. \"the most illogical book ever written.\"--_Life and Letters\r\nof Sir C. Lyell_, vol. ii. p. 358.\r\n\r\n[192] \"On the Zoological Geography of the Malay Archipelago.\"--_Linn.\r\nSoc.

He was\r\neducated at Cambridge, and from 1842 to 1846 he acted as naturalist to\r\nH.M.S. _Fly_, on an exploring expedition in Australia and New Guinea. He\r\nwas afterwards appointed Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland.\r\nHe was the author of many papers, and of more than one good handbook of\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\n[198] Professor of Geology in the University of Glasgow.

Thwaites, F.R.S., was born in 1811, or about that\r\ndate, and died in Ceylon, September 11, 1882. He began life as a Notary,\r\nbut his passion for Botany and Entomology ultimately led to his taking\r\nto Science as a profession. He became lecturer on Botany at the Bristol\r\nSchool of Medicine, and in 1849 he was appointed Director of the Botanic\r\nGardens at Peradeniya, which he made \"the most beautiful tropical garden\r\nin the world.\" He is best known through his important discovery of\r\nconjugation in the Diatomaceae (1847). His _Enumeratio Plantarum\r\nZeylaniae_ (1858-64) was \"the first complete account, on modern lines, of\r\nany definitely circumscribed tropical area.\" (From a notice in _Nature_,\r\nOctober 26, 1882.)\r\n\r\n[201] _Spectator_, March 24, 1860. There were favourable notices of the\r\nOrigin by Huxley in the _Westminster Review_, and Carpenter in the\r\n_Medico-Chir.

I freely acknowledge that Mr.\r\nMatthew has anticipated by many years the explanation which I have\r\noffered of the origin of species, under the name of natural selection. I\r\nthink that no one will feel surprised that neither I, nor apparently any\r\nother naturalist, had heard of Mr. Matthew's views, considering how\r\nbriefly they are given, and that they appeared in the appendix to a work\r\non Naval Timber and Arboriculture. I can do no more than offer my\r\napologies to Mr. Matthew for my entire ignorance of his publication. If\r\nanother edition of my work is called for, I will insert to the foregoing\r\neffect.\" In spite of my father's recognition of his claims, Mr. Matthew\r\nremained unsatisfied, and complained that an article in the _Saturday\r\nAnalyst and Leader_, Nov. 24, 1860, was \"scarcely fair in alluding to\r\nMr. Darwin as the parent of the origin of species, seeing that I\r\npublished the whole that Mr. Darwin attempts to prove, more than\r\ntwenty-nine years ago.\" It was not until later that he learned that\r\nMatthew had also been forestalled. In October 1865, he wrote Sir J. D.\r\nHooker:--\"Talking of the _Origin_, a Yankee has called my attention to a\r\npaper attached to Dr. Wells' famous _Essay on Dew_, which was read in\r\n1813 to the Royal Soc., but not [then] printed, in which he applies most\r\ndistinctly the principle of Natural Selection to the races of Man. So\r\npoor old Patrick Matthew is not the first, and he cannot, or ought not,\r\nany longer to put on his title-pages, 'Discoverer of the principle of\r\nNatural Selection'!\"\r\n\r\n[206] This refers to a \"savage onslaught\" on the _Origin_ by Sedgwick at\r\nthe Cambridge Philosophical Society. Henslow defended his old pupil, and\r\nmaintained that \"the subject was a legitimate one for investigation.\"\r\n\r\n[207] \"The battle rages furiously in the United States. Gray says he was\r\npreparing a speech, which would take 1-1/2 hours to deliver, and which he\r\n'fondly hoped would be a stunner.' He is fighting splendidly, and there\r\nseem to have been many discussions with Agassiz and others at the\r\nmeetings. Agassiz pities me much at being so deluded.\"--From a letter to\r\nHooker, May 30th, 1860.\r\n\r\n[208] The statement as to authorship was made on the authority of Robert\r\nChambers.\r\n\r\n[209] In a letter to Mr. Huxley my father wrote:--\"Have you seen the\r\nlast _Saturday Review_? I am very glad of the defence of you and of\r\nmyself. I wish the reviewer had noticed Hooker. The reviewer, whoever he\r\nis, is a jolly good fellow, as this review and the last on me showed. He\r\nwrites capitally, and understands well his subject. I wish he had\r\nslapped [the _Edinburgh_ reviewer] a little bit harder.\"\r\n\r\n[210] _Man's Place in Nature_, by T. H. Huxley, 1863, p. 114.\r\n\r\n[211] See the _Nat. Hist. Review_, 1861.\r\n\r\n[212] It was well known that Bishop Wilberforce was going to speak.\r\n\r\n[213] _Quarterly Review_, July 1860.\r\n\r\n[214] Sir John Lubbock also insisted on the embryological evidence for\r\nevolution.--F. D.\r\n\r\n[215] Mr. Fawcett wrote (_Macmillan's Magazine_, 1860):--\"The retort was\r\nso justly deserved and so inimitable in its manner, that no one who was\r\npresent can ever forget the impression that it made.\"\r\n\r\n[216] This agrees with Professor Victor Carus's recollection.\r\n\r\n[217] See Professor Newton's interesting _Early Days of Darwinism in\r\nMacmillan's Magazine_, Feb. 1888, where the battle at Oxford is briefly\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[218] _Quarterly Review_, July 1860. The article in question was by\r\nWilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, and was afterwards published in his\r\n_Essays Contributed to the Quarterly Review_, 1874. In the _Life and\r\nLetters_, ii. p. 182, Mr. Huxley has given some account of this article.\r\nI quote a few lines:--\"Since Lord Brougham assailed Dr. Young, the world\r\nhas seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a\r\nMaster in Science as this remarkable production, in which one of the\r\nmost exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most candid of\r\nexpositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as a 'flighty'\r\nperson, who endeavours 'to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess\r\nand speculation,' and whose 'mode of dealing with nature' is reprobated\r\nas 'utterly dishonourable to Natural Science.'\" The passage from the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_, referred to in the letter, gives the history of the\r\nevolution of space from the \"primaeval point or _punctum saliens_ of the\r\nuniverse,\" which is conceived to have moved \"forward in a right line,\r\n_ad infinitum_, till it grew tired; after which the right line, which it\r\nhad generated, would begin to put itself in motion in a lateral\r\ndirection, describing an area of infinite extent. This area, as soon as\r\nit became conscious of its own existence, would begin to ascend or\r\ndescend according as its specific gravity would determine it, forming an\r\nimmense solid space filled with vacuum, and capable of containing the\r\npresent universe.\"\r\n\r\nThe following (p. 263) may serve as an example of the passages in which\r\nthe reviewer refers to Sir Charles Lyell:--\"That Mr. Darwin should have\r\nwandered from this broad highway of nature's works into the jungle of\r\nfanciful assumption is no small evil. We trust that he is mistaken in\r\nbelieving that he may count Sir C. Lyell as one of his converts. We\r\nknow, indeed, the strength of the temptations which he can bring to bear\r\nupon his geological brother.... Yet no man has been more distinct and\r\nmore logical in the denial of the transmutation of species than Sir C.\r\nLyell, and that not in the infancy of his scientific life, but in its\r\nfull vigour and maturity.\" The Bishop goes on to appeal to Lyell, in\r\norder that with his help \"this flimsy speculation may be as completely\r\nput down as was what in spite of all denials we must venture to call its\r\ntwin though less instructed brother, the _Vestiges of Creation_.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to this article, Mr. Brodie Innes, my father's old friend\r\nand neighbour, writes:--\"Most men would have been annoyed by an article\r\nwritten with the Bishop's accustomed vigour, a mixture of argument and\r\nridicule. Mr. Darwin was writing on some parish matter, and put a\r\npostscript--'If you have not seen the last _Quarterly_, do get it; the\r\nBishop of Oxford has made such capital fun of me and my grandfather.' By\r\na curious coincidence, when I received the letter, I was staying in the\r\nsame house with the Bishop, and showed it to him. He said, 'I am very\r\nglad he takes it in that way, he is such a capital fellow.'\"\r\n\r\n[219] April 10th, 1860. Dr. Gray criticised in detail \"several of the\r\npositions taken at the preceding meeting by Mr. [J. A.] Lowell, Prof.\r\nBowen and Prof. Agassiz.\" It was reprinted in the _Athenaeum_, Aug. 4th,\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n[220] On Sept. 26th, 1860, he wrote in the same sense to Gray:--\"You\r\nnever touch the subject without making it clearer. I look at it as even\r\nmore extraordinary that you never say a word or use an epithet which\r\ndoes not express fully my meaning. Now Lyell, Hooker, and others, who\r\nperfectly understand my book, yet sometimes use expressions to which I\r\ndemur.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SPREAD OF EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n1861--1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the year 1861 saw my father engaged on the 3rd edition\r\n(2000 copies) of the _Origin_, which was largely corrected and added to,\r\nand was published in April, 1861.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, he started, with his family, for Torquay, where he remained\r\nuntil August 27--a holiday which he characteristically enters in his\r\ndiary as \"eight weeks and a day.\" The house he occupied was in Hesketh\r\nCrescent, a pleasantly placed row of houses close above the sea,\r\nsomewhat removed from what was then the main body of the town, and not\r\nfar from the beautiful cliffed coast-line in the neighbourhood of\r\nAnstey's Cove.\r\n\r\nDuring the Torquay holiday, and for the remainder of the year, he worked\r\nat the fertilisation of orchids. This part of the year 1861 is not dealt\r\nwith in the present chapter, because (as explained in the preface) the\r\nrecord of his life, seems to become clearer when the whole of his\r\nbotanical work is placed together and treated separately. The present\r\nchapter will, therefore, include only the progress of his work in the\r\ndirection of a general amplification of the _Origin of Species_--_e.g._,\r\nthe publication of _Animals and Plants_ and the _Descent of Man_. It\r\nwill also give some idea of the growth of belief in evolutionary\r\ndoctrines.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the third edition, he wrote to Mr. Murray in December,\r\n1860:--\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad to hear when you have decided how many copies you will\r\nprint off--the more the better for me in all ways, as far as compatible\r\nwith safety; for I hope never again to make so many corrections, or\r\nrather additions, which I have made in hopes of making my many rather\r\nstupid reviewers at least understand what is meant. I hope and think I\r\nshall improve the book considerably.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature in the new edition was the \"Historical Sketch of\r\nthe Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species,\"[221] which now\r\nappeared for the first time, and was continued in the later editions of\r\nthe work. It bears a strong impress of the author's personal character\r\nin the obvious wish to do full justice to all his predecessors,--though\r\neven in this respect it has not escaped some adverse criticism.\r\n\r\nA passage in a letter to Hooker (March 27, 1861) gives the history of\r\none of his corrections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Here is a good joke: H. C. Watson (who, I fancy and hope, is going to\r\nreview the new edition of the _Origin_) says that in the first four\r\nparagraphs of the introduction, the words 'I,' 'me,' 'my,' occur\r\nforty-three times! I was dimly conscious of the accursed fact. He says\r\nit can be explained phrenologically, which I suppose civilly means, that\r\nI am the most egotistically self-sufficient man alive; perhaps so. I\r\nwonder whether he will print this pleasing fact; it beats hollow the\r\nparentheses in Wollaston's writing.\r\n\r\n\"I am, _my_ dear Hooker, ever yours,\r\n\"C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--Do not spread this pleasing joke; it is rather too biting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wrote a couple of years later, 1863, to Asa Gray, in a manner which\r\nillustrates his use of the personal pronoun in the earlier editions of\r\nthe _Origin_:--\r\n\r\n\"You speak of Lyell as a judge; now what I complain of is that he\r\ndeclines to be a judge.... I have sometimes almost wished that Lyell had\r\npronounced against me. When I say 'me,' I only mean _change of species\r\nby descent_. That seems to me the turning-point. Personally, of course,\r\nI care much about Natural Selection; but that seems to me utterly\r\nunimportant, compared to the question of Creation _or_ Modification.\"\r\n\r\nHe was, at first, alone, and felt himself to be so in maintaining a\r\nrational workable theory of Evolution. It was therefore perfectly\r\nnatural that he should speak of \"my\" theory.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the present year (1861) the final arrangements for\r\nthe first French edition of the _Origin_ were completed, and in\r\nSeptember a copy of the third English edition was despatched to Mdlle.\r\nClemence Royer, who undertook the work of translation. The book was now\r\nspreading on the Continent, a Dutch edition had appeared, and, as we\r\nhave seen, a German translation had been published in 1860. In a letter\r\nto Mr. Murray (September 10, 1861), he wrote, \"My book seems exciting\r\nmuch attention in Germany, judging from the number of discussions sent\r\nme.\" The silence had been broken, and in a few years the voice of German\r\nscience was to become one of the strongest of the advocates of\r\nEvolution.\r\n\r\nA letter, June 23, 1861, gave a pleasant echo from the Continent of the\r\ngrowth of his views:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hugh Falconer[222] to C. Darwin._ 31 Sackville St., W., June 23, 1861.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--I have been to Adelsberg cave and brought back with me\r\na live _Proteus anguinus_, designed for you from the moment I got it;\r\n_i.e._ if you have got an aquarium and would care to have it. I only\r\nreturned last night from the Continent, and hearing from your brother\r\nthat you are about to go to Torquay, I lose no time in making you the\r\noffer. The poor dear animal is still alive--although it has had no\r\nappreciable means of sustenance for a month--and I am most anxious to\r\nget rid of the responsibility of starving it longer. In your hands it\r\nwill thrive and have a fair chance of being developed without delay into\r\nsome type of the Columbidae--say a Pouter or a Tumbler.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin, I have been rambling through the north of Italy, and\r\nGermany lately. Everywhere have I heard your views and your admirable\r\nessay canvassed--the views of course often dissented from, according to\r\nthe special bias of the speaker--but the work, its honesty of purpose,\r\ngrandeur of conception, felicity of illustration, and courageous\r\nexposition, always referred to in terms of the highest admiration. And\r\namong your warmest friends no one rejoiced more heartily in the just\r\nappreciation of Charles Darwin than did,\r\n\r\nYours very truly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father replied:--\r\n\r\n\r\nDown [June 24, 1861].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FALCONER,--I have just received your note, and by good luck a\r\nday earlier than properly, and I lose not a moment in answering you,\r\nand thanking you heartily for your offer of the valuable specimen; but I\r\nhave no aquarium and shall soon start for Torquay, so that it would be a\r\nthousand pities that I should have it. Yet I should certainly much like\r\nto see it, but I fear it is impossible. Would not the Zoological Society\r\nbe the best place? and then the interest which many would take in this\r\nextraordinary animal would repay you for your trouble.\r\n\r\nKind as you have been in taking this trouble and offering me this\r\nspecimen, to tell the truth I value your note more than the specimen. I\r\nshall keep your note amongst a very few precious letters. Your kindness\r\nhas quite touched me.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately and gratefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father, who had the strongest belief in the value of Asa Gray's help,\r\nwas anxious that his evolutionary writings should be more widely known\r\nin England. In the autumn of 1860, and the early part of 1861, he had a\r\ngood deal of correspondence with him as to the publication, in the form\r\nof a pamphlet, of Gray's three articles in the July, August, and October\r\nnumbers of the _Atlantic Monthly_, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find these articles republished in Dr. Gray's\r\n_Darwiniana_, p. 87, under the title \"Natural Selection not inconsistent\r\nwith Natural Theology.\" The pamphlet found many admirers, and my father\r\nbelieved that it was of much value in lessening opposition, and making\r\nconverts to Evolution. His high opinion of it is shown not only in his\r\nletters, but by the fact that he inserted a special notice of it in a\r\nprominent place in the third edition of the _Origin_. Lyell, among\r\nothers, recognised its value as an antidote to the kind of criticism\r\nfrom which the cause of Evolution suffered. Thus my father wrote to Dr.\r\nGray: \"Just to exemplify the use of your pamphlet, the Bishop of London\r\nwas asking Lyell what he thought of the review in the _Quarterly_, and\r\nLyell answered, 'Read Asa Gray in the _Atlantic_.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the same subject he wrote to Gray in the following year:--\r\n\r\n\"I believe that your pamphlet has done my book _great_ good; and I thank\r\nyou from my heart for myself: and believing that the views are in large\r\npart true, I must think that you have done natural science a good turn.\r\nNatural Selection seems to be making a little progress in England and on\r\nthe Continent; a new German edition is called for, and a French one has\r\njust appeared.\"\r\n\r\nThe following may serve as an example of the form assumed between these\r\nfriends of the animosity at that time so strong between England and\r\nAmerica[223]:--\r\n\r\n\"Talking of books, I am in the middle of one which pleases me, though it\r\nis very innocent food, viz. Miss Cooper's _Journal of a Naturalist_. Who\r\nis she? She seems a very clever woman, and gives a capital account of\r\nthe battle between _our_ and _your_ weeds.[224] Does it not hurt your\r\nYankee pride that we thrash you so confoundedly? I am sure Mrs. Gray\r\nwill stick up for your own weeds. Ask her whether they are not more\r\nhonest, downright good sort of weeds. The book gives an extremely pretty\r\npicture of one of your villages; but I see your autumn, though so much\r\nmore gorgeous than ours, comes on sooner, and that is one comfort.\"\r\n\r\nA question constantly recurring in the letters to Gray is that of\r\ndesign. For instance:--\r\n\r\n\"Your question what would convince me of design is a poser. If I saw an\r\nangel come down to teach us good, and I was convinced from others seeing\r\nhim that I was not mad, I should believe in design. If I could be\r\nconvinced thoroughly that life and mind was in an unknown way a function\r\nof other imponderable force, I should be convinced. If man was made of\r\nbrass or iron and no way connected with any other organism which had\r\never lived, I should perhaps be convinced. But this is childish writing.\r\n\r\n\"I have lately been corresponding with Lyell, who, I think, adopts your\r\nidea of the stream of variation having been led or designed. I have\r\nasked him (and he says he will hereafter reflect and answer me) whether\r\nhe believes that the shape of my nose was designed. If he does I have\r\nnothing more to say. If not, seeing what Fanciers have done by selecting\r\nindividual differences in the nasal bones of pigeons, I must think that\r\nit is illogical to suppose that the variations, which natural selection\r\npreserves for the good of any being, have been designed. But I know that\r\nI am in the same sort of muddle (as I have said before) as all the\r\nworld seems to be in with respect to free will, yet with everything\r\nsupposed to have been foreseen or preordained.\"\r\n\r\nThe shape of his nose would perhaps not have been used as an\r\nillustration, if he had remembered Fitz-Roy's objection to that feature\r\n(see _Autobiography_, p. 26). He should, too, have remembered the\r\ndifficulty of predicting the value to an organism of an apparently\r\nunimportant character.\r\n\r\nIn England Professor Huxley was at work in the evolutionary cause. He\r\ngave, in 1862, two lectures at Edinburgh on _Man's Place in Nature_. My\r\nfather wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I am heartily glad of your success in the North. By Jove, you have\r\nattacked Bigotry in its stronghold. I thought you would have been\r\nmobbed. I am so glad that you will publish your Lectures. You seem to\r\nhave kept a due medium between extreme boldness and caution. I am\r\nheartily glad that all went off so well.\"\r\n\r\nA review,[225] by F. W. Hutton, afterwards Professor of Biology and\r\nGeology at Canterbury, N. Z., gave a hopeful note of the time not far\r\noff when a broader view of the argument for Evolution would be accepted.\r\nMy father wrote to the author[226]:--\r\n\r\n\r\nDown, April 20th, 1861.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I hope that you will permit me to thank you for sending me a\r\ncopy of your paper in the _Geologist_, and at the same time to express\r\nmy opinion that you have done the subject a real service by the highly\r\noriginal, striking, and condensed manner with which you have put the\r\ncase. I am actually weary of telling people that I do not pretend to\r\nadduce direct evidence of one species changing into another, but that I\r\nbelieve that this view in the main is correct, because so many phenomena\r\ncan be thus grouped together and explained.\r\n\r\nBut it is generally of no use, I cannot make persons see this. I\r\ngenerally throw in their teeth the universally admitted theory of the\r\nundulations of light--neither the undulations, nor the very existence of\r\nether being proved--yet admitted because the view explains so much. You\r\nare one of the very few who have seen this, and have now put it most\r\nforcibly and clearly. I am much pleased to see how carefully you have\r\nread my book, and what is far more important, reflected on so many\r\npoints with an independent spirit. As I am deeply interested in the\r\nsubject (and I hope not exclusively under a personal point of view) I\r\ncould not resist venturing to thank you for the right good service which\r\nyou have done. Pray believe me, dear sir,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully and obliged.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a still more hopeful sign that work of the first rank in value,\r\nconceived on evolutionary principles, began to be published.\r\n\r\nMy father expressed this idea in a letter to the late Mr. Bates.[227]\r\n\r\n\"Under a general point of view, I am quite convinced (Hooker and Huxley\r\ntook the same view some months ago) that a philosophic view of nature\r\ncan solely be driven into naturalists by treating special subjects as\r\nyou have done.\"\r\n\r\nThis refers to Mr. Bates' celebrated paper on mimicry, with which the\r\nfollowing letter deals:--\r\n\r\n\r\nDown Nov. 20 [1862].\r\n\r\nDEAR BATES,--I have just finished, after several reads, your paper.[228]\r\nIn my opinion it is one of the most remarkable and admirable papers I\r\never read in my life. The mimetic cases are truly marvellous, and you\r\nconnect excellently a host of analogous facts. The illustrations are\r\nbeautiful, and seem very well chosen; but it would have saved the reader\r\nnot a little trouble, if the name of each had been engraved below each\r\nseparate figure. No doubt this would have put the engraver into fits, as\r\nit would have destroyed the beauty of the plate. I am not at all\r\nsurprised at such a paper having consumed much time. I am rejoiced that\r\nI passed over the whole subject in the _Origin_, for I should have made\r\na precious mess of it. You have most clearly stated and solved a\r\nwonderful problem. No doubt with most people this will be the cream of\r\nthe paper; but I am not sure that all your facts and reasonings on\r\nvariation, and on the segregation of complete and semi-complete species,\r\nis not really more, or at least as valuable a part. I never conceived\r\nthe process nearly so clearly before; one feels present at the creation\r\nof new forms. I wish, however, you had enlarged a little more on the\r\npairing of similar varieties; a rather more numerous body of facts seems\r\nhere wanted. Then, again, what a host of curious miscellaneous\r\nobservations there are--as on related sexual and individual variability:\r\nthese will some day, if I live, be a treasure to me.\r\n\r\nWith respect to mimetic resemblance being so common with insects, do you\r\nnot think it may be connected with their small size; they cannot defend\r\nthemselves; they cannot escape by flight, at least, from birds,\r\ntherefore they escape by trickery and deception?\r\n\r\nI have one serious criticism to make, and that is about the title of the\r\npaper; I cannot but think that you ought to have called prominent\r\nattention in it to the mimetic resemblances. Your paper is too good to\r\nbe largely appreciated by the mob of naturalists without souls; but,\r\nrely on it, that it will have _lasting_ value, and I cordially\r\ncongratulate you on your first great work. You will find, I should\r\nthink, that Wallace will appreciate it. How gets on your book? Keep your\r\nspirits up. A book is no light labour. I have been better lately, and\r\nworking hard, but my health is very indifferent. How is your health?\r\nBelieve me, dear Bates,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nAlthough the battle[229] of Evolution was not yet won, the growth of\r\nbelief was undoubtedly rapid. So that, for instance, Charles Kingsley\r\ncould write to F. D. Maurice[230]:\r\n\r\n\"The state of the scientific mind is most curious; Darwin is conquering\r\neverywhere, and rushing in like a flood, by the mere force of truth and\r\nfact.\"\r\n\r\nThe change did not proceed without a certain amount of personal\r\nbitterness. My father wrote in February, 1863:--\r\n\r\n\"What an accursed evil it is that there should be all this quarrelling\r\nwithin what ought to be the peaceful realms of science.\"\r\n\r\nI do not desire to keep alive the memories of dead quarrels, but some of\r\nthe burning questions of that day are too important from the\r\nbiographical point of view to be altogether omitted. Of this sort is the\r\nhistory of Lyell's conversion to Evolution. It led to no flaw in the\r\nfriendship of the two men principally concerned, but it shook and\r\nirritated a number of smaller people. Lyell was like the Mississippi in\r\nflood, and as he changed his course, the dwellers on the banks were\r\nangered and frightened by the general upsetting of landmarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Down, Feb. 24 [1863].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--I am astonished at your note. I have not seen the\r\n_Athenaeum_,[231] but I have sent for it, and may get it to-morrow; and\r\nwill then say what I think.\r\n\r\nI have read Lyell's book. [_The Antiquity of Man._] The whole certainly\r\nstruck me as a compilation, but of the highest class, for when possible\r\nthe facts have been verified on the spot, making it almost an original\r\nwork. The Glacial chapters seem to me best, and in parts magnificent. I\r\ncould hardly judge about Man, as all the gloss and novelty was\r\ncompletely worn off. But certainly the aggregation of the evidence\r\nproduced a very striking effect on my mind. The chapter comparing\r\nlanguage and changes of species, seems most ingenious and interesting.\r\nHe has shown great skill in picking out salient points in the argument\r\nfor change of species; but I am deeply disappointed (I do not mean\r\npersonally) to find that his timidity prevents him giving any\r\njudgment.... From all my communications with him, I must ever think that\r\nhe has really entirely lost faith in the immutability of species; and\r\nyet one of his strongest sentences is nearly as follows; \"If it should\r\n_ever_[232] be rendered highly probable that species change by variation\r\nand natural selection,\" &c. &c. I had hoped he would have guided the\r\npublic as far as his own belief went.... One thing does please me on\r\nthis subject, that he seems to appreciate your work. No doubt the public\r\nor a part may be induced to think that, as he gives to us a larger space\r\nthan to Lamarck, he must think that there is something in our views.\r\nWhen reading the brain chapter, it struck me forcibly that if he had\r\nsaid openly that he believed in change of species, and as a consequence\r\nthat man was derived from some Quadrumanous animal, it would have been\r\nvery proper to have discussed by compilation the differences in the most\r\nimportant organ, viz. the brain. As it is, the chapter seems to me to\r\ncome in rather by the head and shoulders. I do not think (but then I am\r\nas prejudiced as Falconer and Huxley, or more so) that it is too severe;\r\nit struck me as given with judicial force. It might perhaps be said with\r\ntruth that he had no business to judge on a subject on which he knows\r\nnothing; but compilers must do this to a certain extent. (You know I\r\nvalue and rank high compilers, being one myself!)\r\n\r\nThe Lyells are coming here on Sunday evening to stay till Wednesday. I\r\ndread it, but I must say how much disappointed I am that he has not\r\nspoken out on species, still less on man. And the best of the joke is\r\nthat he thinks he has acted with the courage of a martyr of old. I hope\r\nI may have taken an exaggerated view of his timidity, and shall\r\n_particularly_ be glad of your opinion on this head. When I got his book\r\nI turned over the pages, and saw he had discussed the subject of\r\nspecies, and said that I thought he would do more to convert the public\r\nthan all of us, and now (which makes the case worse for me) I must, in\r\ncommon honesty, retract. I wish to Heaven he had said not a word on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell_. Down, March 6 [1863].\r\n\r\n... I have been of course deeply interested by your book.[233] I have\r\nhardly any remarks worth sending, but will scribble a little on what\r\nmost interested me. But I will first get out what I hate saying, viz.\r\nthat I have been greatly disappointed that you have not given judgment\r\nand spoken fairly out what you think about the derivation of species. I\r\nshould have been contented if you had boldly said that species have not\r\nbeen separately created, and had thrown as much doubt as you like on how\r\nfar variation and natural selection suffices. I hope to Heaven I am\r\nwrong (and from what you say about Whewell it seems so), but I cannot\r\nsee how your chapters can do more good than an extraordinary able\r\nreview. I think the _Parthenon_ is right, that you will leave the public\r\nin a fog. No doubt they may infer that as you give more space to myself,\r\nWallace, and Hooker, than to Lamarck, you think more of us. But I had\r\nalways thought that your judgment would have been an epoch in the\r\nsubject. All that is over with me, and I will only think on the\r\nadmirable skill with which you have selected the striking points, and\r\nexplained them. No praise can be too strong, in my opinion, for the\r\ninimitable chapter on language in comparison with species....\r\n\r\nI know you will forgive me for writing with perfect freedom, for you\r\nmust know how deeply I respect you as my old honoured guide and master.\r\nI heartily hope and expect that your book will have a gigantic\r\ncirculation, and may do in many ways as much good as it ought to do. I\r\nam tired, so no more. I have written so briefly that you will have to\r\nguess my meaning. I fear my remarks are hardly worth sending. Farewell,\r\nwith kindest remembrance to Lady Lyell,\r\n\r\nEver yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nA letter from Lyell to Hooker (Mar. 9, 1863), published in Lyell's\r\n_Life and Letters_, vol. ii. p. 361, shows what was his feeling at the\r\ntime:--\r\n\r\n\"He [Darwin] seems much disappointed that I do not go farther with him,\r\nor do not speak out more. I can only say that I have spoken out to the\r\nfull extent of my present convictions, and even beyond my state of\r\n_feeling_ as to man's unbroken descent from the brutes, and I find I am\r\nhalf converting not a few who were in arms against Darwin, and are even\r\nnow against Huxley.\" Lyell speaks, too, of having had to abandon \"old\r\nand long cherished ideas, which constituted the charm to me of the\r\ntheoretical part of the science in my earlier days, when I believed with\r\nPascal in the theory, as Hallam terms it, of 'the archangel ruined.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to C. Lyell_. Down, 12th [March, 1863].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LYELL,--I thank you for your very interesting and kind, I may\r\nsay, charming letter. I feared you might be huffed for a little time\r\nwith me. I know some men would have been so.... As you say that you have\r\ngone as far as you believe on the species question, I have not a word to\r\nsay; but I must feel convinced that at times, judging from conversation,\r\nexpressions, letters, &c., you have as completely given up belief in\r\nimmutability of specific forms as I have done. I must still think a\r\nclear expression from you, _if you could have given it_, would have been\r\npotent with the public, and all the more so, as you formerly held\r\nopposite opinions. The more I work, the more satisfied I become with\r\nvariation and natural selection, but that part of the case I look at as\r\nless important, though more interesting to me personally. As you ask for\r\ncriticisms on this head (and believe me that I should not have made them\r\nunasked), I may specify (pp. 412, 413) that such words as \"Mr. D.\r\nlabours to show,\" \"is believed by the author to throw light,\" would lead\r\na common reader to think that you yourself do _not_ at all agree, but\r\nmerely think it fair to give my opinion. Lastly, you refer repeatedly to\r\nmy view as a modification of Lamarck's doctrine of development and\r\nprogression. If this is your deliberate opinion there is nothing to be\r\nsaid, but it does not seem so to me. Plato, Buffon, my grandfather\r\nbefore Lamarck, and others, propounded the _obvious_ view that if\r\nspecies were not created separately they must have descended from other\r\nspecies, and I can see nothing else in common between the _Origin_ and\r\nLamarck. I believe this way of putting the case is very injurious to its\r\nacceptance, as it implies necessary progression, and closely connects\r\nWallace's and my views with what I consider, after two deliberate\r\nreadings, as a wretched book, and one from which (I well remember my\r\nsurprise) I gained nothing. But I know you rank it higher, which is\r\ncurious, as it did not in the least shake your belief. But enough, and\r\nmore than enough. Please remember you have brought it all down on\r\nyourself!!\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear about Falconer's \"reclamation.\"[234] I hate the\r\nvery word, and have a sincere affection for him.\r\n\r\nDid you ever read anything so wretched as the _Athenaeum_ reviews of you,\r\nand of Huxley[235] especially. Your _object_ to make man old, and\r\nHuxley's _object_ to degrade him. The wretched writer has not a glimpse\r\nof what the discovery of scientific truth means. How splendid some pages\r\nare in Huxley, but I fear the book will not be popular....\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Athenaeum_, Mar. 28, 1862, p. 417, appeared a notice of Dr.\r\nCarpenter's book on 'Foraminifera,' which led to more skirmishing in the\r\nsame journal. The article was remarkable for upholding spontaneous\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nMy father wrote, Mar. 29, 1863:--\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks for _Athenaeum_, received this morning, and to be returned\r\nto-morrow morning. Who would have ever thought of the old stupid\r\n_Athenaeum_ taking to Oken-like transcendental philosophy written in\r\nOwenian style!\r\n\r\n\"It will be some time before we see 'slime, protoplasm, &c.' generating\r\na new animal. But I have long regretted that I truckled to public\r\nopinion, and used the Pentateuchal term of creation,[236] by which I\r\nreally meant 'appeared' by some wholly unknown process. It is mere\r\nrubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well\r\nthink of the origin of matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Athenaeum_ continued to be a scientific battle-ground. On April 4,\r\n1863, Falconer wrote a severe article on Lyell. And my father wrote\r\n(_Athenaeum_, 1863, p. 554), under the cloak of attacking spontaneous\r\ngeneration, to defend Evolution. In reply, an article appeared in the\r\nsame Journal (May 2nd, 1863, p. 586), accusing my father of claiming for\r\nhis views the exclusive merit of \"connecting by an intelligible thread\r\nof reasoning\" a number of facts in morphology, &c. The writer remarks\r\nthat, \"The different generalisations cited by Mr. Darwin as being\r\nconnected by an intelligible thread of reasoning exclusively through his\r\nattempt to explain specific transmutation are in fact related to it in\r\nthis wise, that they have prepared the minds of naturalists for a better\r\nreception of such attempts to explain the way of the origin of species\r\nfrom species.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this my father replied as follows in the _Athenaeum_ of May 9th,\r\n1863:--\r\n\r\n\r\nDown, May 5 [1863].\r\n\r\nI hope that you will grant me space to own that your reviewer is quite\r\ncorrect when he states that any theory of descent will connect, \"by an\r\nintelligible thread of reasoning,\" the several generalizations before\r\nspecified. I ought to have made this admission expressly; with the\r\nreservation, however, that, as far as I can judge, no theory so well\r\nexplains or connects these several generalizations (more especially the\r\nformation of domestic races in comparison with natural species, the\r\nprinciples of classification, embryonic resemblance, &c.) as the theory,\r\nor hypothesis, or guess, if the reviewer so likes to call it, of Natural\r\nSelection. Nor has any other satisfactory explanation been ever offered\r\nof the almost perfect adaptation of all organic beings to each other,\r\nand to their physical conditions of life. Whether the naturalist\r\nbelieves in the views given by Lamarck, by Geoffroy St. Hilaire, by the\r\nauthor of the _Vestiges_, by Mr. Wallace and myself, or in any other\r\nsuch view, signifies extremely little in comparison with the admission\r\nthat species have descended from other species, and have not been\r\ncreated immutable; for he who admits this as a great truth has a wide\r\nfield opened to him for further inquiry. I believe, however, from what I\r\nsee of the progress of opinion on the Continent, and in this country,\r\nthat the theory of Natural Selection will ultimately be adopted, with,\r\nno doubt, many subordinate modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following, he refers to the above letter to the _Athenaeum_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to J. D. Hooker._ Saturday [May 11, 1863].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--You give good advice about not writing in newspapers; I\r\nhave been gnashing my teeth at my own folly; and this not caused by\r\n----'s sneers, which were so good that I almost enjoyed them. I have\r\nwritten once again to own to a certain extent of truth in what he says,\r\nand then if I am ever such a fool again, have no mercy on me. I have\r\nread the squib in _Public Opinion_;[237] it is capital; if there is\r\nmore, and you have a copy, do lend it. It shows well that a scientific\r\nman had better be trampled in dirt than squabble.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1864) he received the greatest honour which a\r\nscientific man can receive in this country, the Copley Medal of the\r\nRoyal Society. It is presented at the Anniversary Meeting on St.\r\nAndrew's Day (Nov. 30), the medallist being usually present to receive\r\nit, but this the state of my father's health prevented. He wrote to Mr.\r\nFox:--\r\n\r\n\"I was glad to see your hand-writing. The Copley, being open to all\r\nsciences and all the world, is reckoned a great honour; but excepting\r\nfrom several kind letters, such things make little difference to me. It\r\nshows, however, that Natural Selection is making some progress in this\r\ncountry, and that pleases me. The subject, however, is safe in foreign\r\nlands.\"\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the Copley Medal is of interest in connection with\r\nwhat has gone before, inasmuch as it led to Sir C. Lyell making, in his\r\nafter-dinner speech, a \"confession of faith as to the _Origin_.\" He\r\nwrote to my father (_Life of Sir C. Lyell_, vol. ii. p. 384), \"I said I\r\nhad been forced to give up my old faith without thoroughly seeing my way\r\nto a new one. But I think you would have been satisfied with the length\r\nI went.\"\r\n\r\nLyell's acceptance of Evolution was made public in the tenth edition of\r\nthe _Principles_, published in 1867 and 1868. It was a sign of\r\nimprovement, \"a great triumph,\" as my father called it, that an\r\nevolutionary article by Wallace, dealing with Lyell's book, should have\r\nappeared in the _Quarterly Review_ (April, 1869). Mr. Wallace wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"The history of science hardly presents so striking an instance of\r\nyouthfulness of mind in advanced life as is shown by this abandonment of\r\nopinions so long held and so powerfully advocated; and if we bear in\r\nmind the extreme caution, combined with the ardent love of truth which\r\ncharacterise every work which our author has produced, we shall be\r\nconvinced that so great a change was not decided on without long and\r\nanxious deliberation, and that the views now adopted must indeed be\r\nsupported by arguments of overwhelming force. If for no other reason\r\nthan that Sir Charles Lyell in his tenth edition has adopted it, the\r\ntheory of Mr. Darwin deserves an attentive and respectful consideration\r\nfrom every earnest seeker after truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe incident of the Copley Medal is interesting as giving an index of\r\nthe state of the scientific mind at the time.\r\n\r\nMy father wrote: \"some of the old members of the Royal are quite shocked\r\nat my having the Copley.\" In the _Reader_, December 3, 1864, General\r\nSabine's presidential address at the Anniversary Meeting is reported at\r\nsome length. Special weight was laid on my father's work in Geology,\r\nZoology, and Botany, but the _Origin of Species_ was praised chiefly as\r\ncontaining a \"mass of observations,\" &c. It is curious that as in the\r\ncase of his election to the French Institute, so in this case, he was\r\nhonoured not for the great work of his life, but for his less important\r\nwork in special lines.\r\n\r\nI believe I am right in saying that no little dissatisfaction at the\r\nPresident's manner of allusion to the _Origin_ was felt by some Fellows\r\nof the Society.\r\n\r\nMy father spoke justly when he said that the subject was \"safe in\r\nforeign lands.\" In telling Lyell of the progress of opinion, he wrote\r\n(March, 1863):--\r\n\r\n\"A first-rate German naturalist[238] (I now forget the name!), who has\r\nlately published a grand folio, has spoken out to the utmost extent on\r\nthe _Origin_. De Candolle, in a very good paper on 'Oaks,' goes, in Asa\r\nGray's opinion, as far as he himself does; but De Candolle, in writing\r\nto me, says _we_, 'we think this and that;' so that I infer he really\r\ngoes to the full extent with me, and tells me of a French good botanical\r\npalaeontologist[239] (name forgotten), who writes to De Candolle that he\r\nis sure that my views will ultimately prevail. But I did not intend to\r\nhave written all this. It satisfies me with the final results, but this\r\nresult, I begin to see, will take two or three life-times. The\r\nentomologists are enough to keep the subject back for half a century.\"\r\n\r\nThe official attitude of French science was not very hopeful. The\r\nSecretaire Perpetuel of the Academie published an _Examen du livre de M.\r\nDarwin_, on which my father remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"A great gun, Flourens, has written a little dull book[240] against me,\r\nwhich pleases me much, for it is plain that our good work is spreading\r\nin France.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley, who reviewed the book,[241] quotes the following passage\r\nfrom Flourens:--\r\n\r\n\"M. Darwin continue: Aucune distinction absolue n'a ete et ne peut etre\r\netablie entre les especes et les varietes! Je vous ai deja dit que vous\r\nvous trompiez; une distinction absolue separe les varietes d'avec les\r\nespeces.\" Mr. Huxley remarks on this, \"Being devoid of the blessings of\r\nan Academy in England, we are unaccustomed to see our ablest men treated\r\nin this way even by a Perpetual Secretary.\" After demonstrating M.\r\nFlourens' misapprehension of Natural Selection, Mr. Huxley says, \"How\r\none knows it all by heart, and with what relief one reads at p. 65, 'Je\r\nlaisse M. Darwin.'\"\r\n\r\nThe deterrent effect of the Academie on the spread of Evolution in\r\nFrance has been most striking. Even at the present day a member of the\r\nInstitute does not feel quite happy in owning to a belief in Darwinism.\r\nWe may indeed be thankful that we are \"devoid of such a blessing.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Germans, he was fast gaining supporters. In 1865 he began a\r\ncorrespondence with the distinguished Naturalist, Fritz Mueller, then, as\r\nnow, resident in Brazil. They never met, but the correspondence with\r\nMueller, which continued to the close of my father's life, was a source\r\nof very great pleasure to him. My impression is that of all his unseen\r\nfriends Fritz Mueller was the one for whom he had the strongest regard.\r\nFritz Mueller is the brother of another distinguished man, the late\r\nHermann Mueller, the author of _Die Befruchtung der Blumen_ (The\r\nFertilisation of Flowers), and of much other valuable work.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of writing to Fritz Mueller was the latter's book, _Fuer\r\nDarwin_, which was afterwards translated by Mr. Dallas at my father's\r\nsuggestion, under the title _Facts and Arguments for Darwin_.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, in 1866, began his connection with Professor Victor\r\nCarus, of Leipzig, who undertook the translation of the 4th edition of\r\nthe _Origin_. From this time forward Professor Carus continued to\r\ntranslate my father's books into German. The conscientious care with\r\nwhich this work was done was of material service, and I well remember\r\nthe admiration (mingled with a tinge of vexation at his own\r\nshortcomings) with which my father used to receive the lists of\r\noversights, &c., which Professor Carus discovered in the course of\r\ntranslation. The connection was not a mere business one, but was\r\ncemented by warm feelings of regard on both sides.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, too, he came in contact with Professor Ernst Haeckel,\r\nwhose influence on German science has been so powerful.\r\n\r\nThe earliest letter which I have seen from my father to Professor\r\nHaeckel, was written in 1865, and from that time forward they\r\ncorresponded (though not, I think, with any regularity) up to the end of\r\nmy father's life. His friendship with Haeckel was not merely the growth\r\nof correspondence, as was the case with some others, for instance, Fritz\r\nMueller. Haeckel paid more than one visit to Down, and these were\r\nthoroughly enjoyed by my father. The following letter will serve to show\r\nthe strong feeling of regard which he entertained for his\r\ncorrespondent--a feeling which I have often heard him emphatically\r\nexpress, and which was warmly returned. The book referred to is\r\nHaeckel's _Generelle Morphologie_, published in 1866, a copy of which my\r\nfather received from the author in January, 1867.\r\n\r\nDr. E. Krause[242] has given a good account of Professor Haeckel's\r\nservices in the cause of Evolution. After speaking of the lukewarm\r\nreception which the _Origin_ met with in Germany on its first\r\npublication, he goes on to describe the first adherents of the new faith\r\nas more or less popular writers, not especially likely to advance its\r\nacceptance with the professorial or purely scientific world. And he\r\nclaims for Haeckel that it was his advocacy of Evolution in his\r\n_Radiolaria_ (1862), and at the \"Versammlung\" of Naturalists at Stettin\r\nin 1863, that placed the Darwinian question for the first time publicly\r\nbefore the forum of German science, and his enthusiastic propagandism\r\nthat chiefly contributed to its success.\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley, writing in 1869, paid a high tribute to Professor Haeckel as\r\nthe Coryphaeus of the Darwinian movement in Germany. Of his _Generelle\r\nMorphologie_, \"an attempt to work out the practical applications\" of the\r\ndoctrine of Evolution to their final results, he says that it has the\r\n\"force and suggestiveness, and ... systematising power of Oken without\r\nhis extravagance.\" Mr. Huxley also testifies to the value of Haeckel's\r\n_Schoepfungs-Geschichte_ as an exposition of the _Generelle Morphologie_\r\n\"for an educated public.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in his _Evolution in Biology_,[243] Mr. Huxley wrote: \"Whatever\r\nhesitation may not unfrequently be felt by less daring minds, in\r\nfollowing Haeckel in many of his speculations, his attempt to\r\nsystematise the doctrine of Evolution and to exhibit its influence as\r\nthe central thought of modern biology, cannot fail to have a\r\nfar-reaching influence on the progress of science.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following letter my father alludes to the somewhat fierce manner\r\nin which Professor Haeckel fought the battle of 'Darwinismus,' and on\r\nthis subject Dr. Krause has some good remarks (p. 162). He asks whether\r\nmuch that happened in the heat of the conflict might not well have been\r\notherwise, and adds that Haeckel himself is the last man to deny this.\r\nNevertheless he thinks that even these things may have worked well for\r\nthe cause of Evolution, inasmuch as Haeckel \"concentrated on himself by\r\nhis _Ursprung des Menschen-Geschlechts_, his _Generelle Morphologie_,\r\nand _Schoepfungs-Geschichte_, all the hatred and bitterness which\r\nEvolution excited in certain quarters,\" so that, \"in a surprisingly\r\nshort time it became the fashion in Germany that Haeckel alone should be\r\nabused, while Darwin was held up as the ideal of forethought and\r\nmoderation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to E. Haeckel._ Down, May 21, 1867.\r\n\r\nDEAR HAECKEL,--Your letter of the 18th has given me great pleasure, for\r\nyou have received what I said in the most kind and cordial manner. You\r\nhave in part taken what I said much stronger than I had intended. It\r\nnever occurred to me for a moment to doubt that your work, with the\r\nwhole subject so admirably and clearly arranged, as well as fortified by\r\nso many new facts and arguments, would not advance our common object in\r\nthe highest degree. All that I think is that you will excite anger, and\r\nthat anger so completely blinds every one that your arguments would have\r\nno chance of influencing those who are already opposed to our views.\r\nMoreover, I do not at all like that you, towards whom I feel so much\r\nfriendship, should unnecessarily make enemies, and there is pain and\r\nvexation enough in the world without more being caused. But I repeat\r\nthat I can feel no doubt that your work will greatly advance our\r\nsubject, and I heartily wish it could be translated into English, for my\r\nown sake and that of others. With respect to what you say about my\r\nadvancing too strongly objections against my own views, some of my\r\nEnglish friends think that I have erred on this side; but truth\r\ncompelled me to write what I did, and I am inclined to think it was good\r\npolicy. The belief in the descent theory is slowly spreading in\r\nEngland,[244] even amongst those who can give no reason for their\r\nbelief. No body of men were at first so much opposed to my views as the\r\nmembers of the London Entomological Society, but now I am assured that,\r\nwith the exception of two or three old men, all the members concur with\r\nme to a certain extent. It has been a great disappointment to me that I\r\nhave never received your long letter written to me from the Canary\r\nIslands. I am rejoiced to hear that your tour, which seems to have been\r\na most interesting one, has done your health much good.\r\n\r\n... I am very glad to hear that there is some chance of your visiting\r\nEngland this autumn, and all in this house will be delighted to see you\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Haeckel, yours very sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\nI place here an extract from a letter of later date (Nov. 1868), which\r\nrefers to one of Haeckel's later works.[245]\r\n\r\n\"Your chapters on the affinities and genealogy of the animal kingdom\r\nstrike me as admirable and full of original thought. Your boldness,\r\nhowever, sometimes makes me tremble, but as Huxley remarked, some one\r\nmust be bold enough to make a beginning in drawing up tables of descent.\r\nAlthough you fully admit the imperfection of the geological record, yet\r\nHuxley agreed with me in thinking that you are sometimes rather rash in\r\nventuring to say at what periods the several groups first appeared. I\r\nhave this advantage over you, that I remember how wonderfully different\r\nany statement on this subject made 20 years ago, would have been to what\r\nwould now be the case, and I expect the next 20 years will make quite as\r\ngreat a difference.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter to Professor W. Preyer, a well-known\r\nphysiologist, shows that he estimated at its true value the help he was\r\nto receive from the scientific workers of Germany:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 31, 1868.\r\n\r\n... I am delighted to hear that you uphold the doctrine of the\r\nModification of Species, and defend my views. The support which I\r\nreceive from Germany is my chief ground for hoping that our views will\r\nultimately prevail. To the present day I am continually abused or\r\ntreated with contempt by writers of my own country; but the younger\r\nnaturalists are almost all on my side, and sooner or later the public\r\nmust follow those who make the subject their special study. The abuse\r\nand contempt of ignorant writers hurts me very little....\r\n\r\n\r\nI must now pass on to the publication, in 1868, of his book on _The\r\nVariation of Animals and Plants under Domestication_. It was begun two\r\ndays after the appearance of the second edition of the _Origin_, on Jan.\r\n9, 1860, and it may, I think, be reckoned that about half of the eight\r\nyears that elapsed between its commencement and completion was spent on\r\nit. The book did not escape adverse criticism: it was said, for\r\ninstance, that the public had been patiently waiting for Mr. Darwin's\r\n_pieces justicatives_, and that after eight years of expectation, all\r\nthey got was a mass of detail about pigeons, rabbits and silk-worms. But\r\nthe true critics welcomed it as an expansion with unrivalled wealth of\r\nillustration of a section of the _Origin_. Variation under the influence\r\nof man was the only subject (except the question of man's origin) which\r\nhe was able to deal with in detail so as to utilise his full stores of\r\nknowledge. When we remember how important for his argument is a\r\nknowledge of the action of artificial selection, we may well rejoice\r\nthat this subject was chosen by him for amplification.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, he wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker:\r\n\r\n\"I have begun looking over my old MS., and it is as fresh as if I had\r\nnever written it; parts are astonishingly dull, but yet worth printing,\r\nI think; and other parts strike me as very good. I am a complete\r\nmillionaire in odd and curious little facts, and I have been really\r\nastounded at my own industry whilst reading my chapters on Inheritance\r\nand Selection. God knows when the book will ever be completed, for I\r\nfind that I am very weak, and on my best days cannot do more than one or\r\none and a half hours' work. It is a good deal harder than writing about\r\nmy dear climbing plants.\"\r\n\r\nIn Aug. 1867, when Lyell was reading the proofs of the book, my father\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I thank you cordially for your last two letters. The former one did me\r\n_real_ good, for I had got so wearied with the subject that I could\r\nhardly bear to correct the proofs, and you gave me fresh heart. I\r\nremember thinking that when you came to the Pigeon chapter you would\r\npass it over as quite unreadable. I have been particularly pleased that\r\nyou have noticed Pangenesis. I do not know whether you ever had the\r\nfeeling of having thought so much over a subject that you had lost all\r\npower of judging it. This is my case with Pangenesis (which is 26 or 27\r\nyears old), but I am inclined to think that if it be admitted as a\r\nprobable hypothesis it will be a somewhat important step in Biology.\"\r\n\r\nHis theory of Pangenesis, by which he attempted to explain \"how the\r\ncharacters of the parents are 'photographed' on the child, by means of\r\nmaterial atoms derived from each cell in both parents, and developed in\r\nthe child,\" has never met with much acceptance. Nevertheless, some of\r\nhis contemporaries felt with him about it. Thus in February 1868, he\r\nwrote to Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I heard yesterday from Wallace, who says (excuse horrid vanity), 'I can\r\nhardly tell you how much I admire the chapter on _Pangenesis_. It is a\r\n_positive comfort_ to me to have any feasible explanation of a\r\ndifficulty that has always been haunting me, and I shall never be able\r\nto give it up till a better one supplies its place, and that I think\r\nhardly possible.' Now his foregoing [italicised] words express my\r\nsentiments exactly and fully: though perhaps I feel the relief extra\r\nstrongly from having during many years vainly attempted to form some\r\nhypothesis. When you or Huxley say that a single cell of a plant, or the\r\nstump of an amputated limb, has the 'potentiality' of reproducing the\r\nwhole--or 'diffuses an influence,' these words give me no positive\r\nidea;--but, when it is said that the cells of a plant, or stump, include\r\natoms derived from every other cell of the whole organism and capable of\r\ndevelopment, I gain a distinct idea.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the publication of the book, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nDown, February 10 [1868].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--What is the good of having a friend, if one may not\r\nboast to him? I heard yesterday that Murray has sold in a week the whole\r\nedition of 1500 copies of my book, and the sale so pressing that he has\r\nagreed with Clowes to get another edition in fourteen days! This has\r\ndone me a world of good, for I had got into a sort of dogged hatred of\r\nmy book. And now there has appeared a review in the _Pall Mall_ which\r\nhas pleased me excessively, more perhaps than is reasonable. I am quite\r\ncontent, and do not care how much I may be pitched into. If by any\r\nchance you should hear who wrote the article in the _Pall Mall_, do\r\nplease tell me; it is some one who writes capitally, and who knows the\r\nsubject. I went to luncheon on Sunday, to Lubbock's, partly in hopes of\r\nseeing you, and, be hanged to you, you were not there.\r\n\r\nYour cock-a-hoop friend,\r\nC. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndependently of the favourable tone of the able series of notices in\r\nthe _Pall Mall Gazette_ (Feb. 10, 15, 17, 1868), my father may well have\r\nbeen gratified by the following passages:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We must call attention to the rare and noble calmness with which he\r\nexpounds his own views, undisturbed by the heats of polemical agitation\r\nwhich those views have excited, and persistently refusing to retort on\r\nhis antagonists by ridicule, by indignation, or by contempt. Considering\r\nthe amount of vituperation and insinuation which has come from the other\r\nside, this forbearance is supremely dignified.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again in the third notice, Feb. 17:--\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere has the author a word that could wound the most sensitive\r\nself-love of an antagonist; nowhere does he, in text or note, expose the\r\nfallacies and mistakes of brother investigators ... but while abstaining\r\nfrom impertinent censure, he is lavish in acknowledging the smallest\r\ndebts he may owe; and his book will make many men happy.\"\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Messrs. Smith and Elder for the information that these\r\narticles were written by Mr. G. H. Lewes.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter (Feb. 1870) to his friend Professor\r\nNewton, the well-known ornithologist, shows how much he valued the\r\nappreciation of his colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it would be universally held extremely wrong for a defendant\r\nto write to a Judge to express his satisfaction at a judgment in his\r\nfavour; and yet I am going thus to act. I have just read what you have\r\nsaid in the 'Record'[246] about my pigeon chapters, and it has gratified\r\nme beyond measure. I have sometimes felt a little disappointed that the\r\nlabour of so many years seemed to be almost thrown away, for you are the\r\nfirst man capable of forming a judgment (excepting partly Quatrefages),\r\nwho seems to have thought anything of this part of my work. The amount\r\nof labour, correspondence, and care, which the subject cost me, is more\r\nthan you could well suppose. I thought the article in the _Athenaeum_ was\r\nvery unjust; but now I feel amply repaid, and I cordially thank you for\r\nyour sympathy and too warm praise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK ON MAN.\r\n\r\nIn February 1867, when the manuscript of _Animals and Plants_ had been\r\nsent to Messrs. Clowes to be printed, and before the proofs began to\r\ncome in, he had an interval of spare time, and began a \"Chapter on Man,\"\r\nbut be soon found it growing under his hands, and determined to publish\r\nit separately as a \"very small volume.\"\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that only four years before this date, namely in 1864,\r\nhe had given up hope of being able to work out this subject. He wrote to\r\nMr. Wallace:--\r\n\r\n\"I have collected a few notes on man, but I do not suppose that I shall\r\never use them. Do you intend to follow out your views, and if so, would\r\nyou like at some future time to have my few references and notes? I am\r\nsure I hardly know whether they are of any value, and they are at\r\npresent in a state of chaos. There is much more that I should like to\r\nwrite, but I have not strength.\" But this was at a period of ill-health;\r\nnot long before, in 1863, he had written in the same depressed tone\r\nabout his future work generally:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been so steadily going downhill, I cannot help doubting whether\r\nI can ever crawl a little uphill again. Unless I can, enough to work a\r\nlittle, I hope my life may be very short, for to lie on a sofa all day\r\nand do nothing but give trouble to the best and kindest of wives and\r\ngood dear children is dreadful.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Chapter on Man,\" which afterwards grew into the _Descent of Man_,\r\nwas interrupted by the necessity of correcting the proofs of _Animals\r\nand Plants_, and by some botanical work, but was resumed with\r\nunremitting industry on the first available day in the following year.\r\nHe could not rest, and he recognised with regret the gradual change in\r\nhis mind that rendered continuous work more and more necessary to him as\r\nhe grew older. This is expressed in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker, June\r\n17, 1868, which repeats to some extent what is given in the\r\n_Autobiography_:--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you were at the _Messiah_, it is the one thing that I should\r\nlike to hear again, but I dare say I should find my soul too dried up to\r\nappreciate it as in old days; and then I should feel very flat, for it\r\nis a horrid bore to feel as I constantly do, that I am a withered leaf\r\nfor every subject except Science. It sometimes makes me hate Science,\r\nthough God knows I ought to be thankful for such a perennial interest,\r\nwhich makes me forget for some hours every day my accursed stomach.\"\r\n\r\n_The Descent of Man_ (and this is indicated on its title-page) consists\r\nof two separate books, namely on the pedigree of mankind, and on sexual\r\nselection in the animal kingdom generally. In studying this latter part\r\nof the subject he had to take into consideration the whole subject of\r\ncolour. I give the two following characteristic letters, in which the\r\nreader is as it were present at the birth of a theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to A. R. Wallace._ Down, February 23 [1867].\r\n\r\nDEAR WALLACE,--I much regretted that I was unable to call on you, but\r\nafter Monday I was unable even to leave the house. On Monday evening I\r\ncalled on Bates, and put a difficulty before him, which he could not\r\nanswer, and, as on some former similar occasion, his first suggestion\r\nwas, \"You had better ask Wallace.\" My difficulty is, why are\r\ncaterpillars sometimes so beautifully and artistically coloured? Seeing\r\nthat many are coloured to escape danger, I can hardly attribute their\r\nbright colour in other cases to mere physical conditions. Bates says the\r\nmost gaudy caterpillar he ever saw in Amazonia (of a sphinx) was\r\nconspicuous at the distance of yards, from its black and red colours,\r\nwhilst feeding on large green leaves. If any one objected to male\r\nbutterflies having been made beautiful by sexual selection, and asked\r\nwhy should they not have been made beautiful as well as their\r\ncaterpillars, what would you answer? I could not answer, but should\r\nmaintain my ground. Will you think over this, and some time, either by\r\nletter or when we meet, tell me what you think?...\r\n\r\n\r\nHe seems to have received an explanation by return of post, for a day or\r\ntwo afterwards he could write to Wallace:--\r\n\r\n\"Bates was quite right; you are the man to apply to in a difficulty. I\r\nnever heard anything more ingenious than your suggestion, and I hope you\r\nmay be able to prove it true. That is a splendid fact about the white\r\nmoths; it warms one's very blood to see a theory thus almost proved to\r\nbe true.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace's suggestion was that conspicuous caterpillars or perfect\r\ninsects (_e.g._ white butterflies), which are distasteful to birds,\r\nbenefit by being promptly recognised and therefore easily avoided.[247]\r\n\r\nThe letter from Darwin to Wallace goes on: \"The reason of my being so\r\nmuch interested just at present about sexual selection is, that I have\r\nalmost resolved to publish a little essay on the origin of Mankind, and\r\nI still strongly think (though I failed to convince you, and this, to\r\nme, is the heaviest blow possible) that sexual selection has been the\r\nmain agent in forming the races of man.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, there is another subject which I shall introduce in my\r\nessay, namely, expression of countenance. Now, do you happen to know by\r\nany odd chance a very good-natured and acute observer in the Malay\r\nArchipelago, who you think would make a few easy observations for me on\r\nthe expression of the Malays when excited by various emotions?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reference to the subject of expression in the above letter is\r\nexplained by the fact, that my father's original intention was to give\r\nhis essay on this subject as a chapter in the _Descent of Man_, which in\r\nits turn grew, as we have seen, out of a proposed chapter in _Animals\r\nand Plants_.\r\n\r\nHe got much valuable help from Dr. Guenther, of the Natural History\r\nMuseum, to whom he wrote in May 1870:--\r\n\r\n\"As I crawl on with the successive classes I am astonished to find how\r\nsimilar the rules are about the nuptial or 'wedding dress' of all\r\nanimals. The subject has begun to interest me in an extraordinary\r\ndegree; but I must try not to fall into my common error of being too\r\nspeculative. But a drunkard might as well say he would drink a little\r\nand not too much! My essay, as far as fishes, batrachians and reptiles\r\nare concerned, will be in fact yours, only written by me.\"\r\n\r\nThe last revise of the _Descent of Man_ was corrected on January 15th,\r\n1871, so that the book occupied him for about three years. He wrote to\r\nSir J. Hooker: \"I finished the last proofs of my book a few days ago;\r\nthe work half-killed me, and I have not the most remote idea whether the\r\nbook is worth publishing.\"\r\n\r\nHe also wrote to Dr. Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I have finished my book on the _Descent of Man_, &c., and its\r\npublication is delayed only by the Index: when published, I will send\r\nyou a copy, but I do not know that you will care about it. Parts, as on\r\nthe moral sense, will, I dare say, aggravate you, and if I hear from\r\nyou, I shall probably receive a few stabs from your polished stiletto of\r\na pen.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was published on February 24, 1871. 2500 copies were printed at\r\nfirst, and 6000 more before the end of the year. My father notes that he\r\nreceived for this edition L1470.\r\n\r\nNothing can give a better idea (in a small compass) of the growth of\r\nEvolutionism, and its position at this time, than a quotation from Mr.\r\nHuxley[248]:--\r\n\r\n\"The gradual lapse of time has now separated us by more than a decade\r\nfrom the date of the publication of the _Origin of Species_; and\r\nwhatever may be thought or said about Mr. Darwin's doctrines, or the\r\nmanner in which he has propounded them, this much is certain, that in a\r\ndozen years the _Origin of Species_ has worked as complete a revolution\r\nin Biological Science as the _Principia_ did in Astronomy;\" and it had\r\ndone so, \"because in the words of Helmholtz, it contains 'an essentially\r\nnew creative thought.' And, as time has slipped by, a happy change has\r\ncome over Mr. Darwin's critics. The mixture of ignorance and insolence\r\nwhich at first characterised a large proportion of the attacks with\r\nwhich he was assailed, is no longer the sad distinction of\r\nanti-Darwinian criticism.\"\r\n\r\nA passage in the Introduction to the _Descent of Man_ shows that the\r\nauthor recognised clearly this improvement in the position of\r\nEvolutionism. \"When a naturalist like Carl Vogt ventures to say in his\r\naddress, as President of the National Institution of Geneva (1869),\r\n'personne, en Europe au moins, n'ose plus soutenir la creation\r\nindependante et de toutes pieces, des especes,' it is manifest that at\r\nleast a large number of naturalists must admit that species are the\r\nmodified descendants of other species; and this especially holds good\r\nwith the younger and rising naturalists.... Of the older and honoured\r\nchiefs in natural science, many, unfortunately, are still opposed to\r\nEvolution in every form.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mr. James Hague's pleasantly written article, \"A Reminiscence of Mr.\r\nDarwin\" (_Harper's Magazine_, October 1884), he describes a visit to my\r\nfather \"early in 1871,\" shortly after the publication of the _Descent of\r\nMan_. Mr. Hague represents my father as \"much impressed by the general\r\nassent with which his views had been received,\" and as remarking that\r\n\"everybody is talking about it without being shocked.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the year the reception of the book is described in different\r\nlanguage in the _Edinburgh Review_: \"On every side it is raising a storm\r\nof mingled wrath, wonder and admiration.\"\r\n\r\nHaeckel seems to have been one of the first to write to my father about\r\nthe _Descent of Man_. I quote from Darwin's reply:--\r\n\r\n\"I must send you a few words to thank you for your interesting, and I\r\nmay truly say, charming letter. I am delighted that you approve of my\r\nbook, as far as you have read it. I felt very great difficulty and doubt\r\nhow often I ought to allude to what you have published; strictly\r\nspeaking every idea, although occurring independently to me, if\r\npublished by you previously ought to have appeared as if taken from your\r\nworks, but this would have made my book very dull reading; and I hoped\r\nthat a full acknowledgment at the beginning would suffice.[249] I cannot\r\ntell you how glad I am to find that I have expressed my high admiration\r\nof your labours with sufficient clearness; I am sure that I have not\r\nexpressed it too strongly.\"\r\n\r\nIn March he wrote to Professor Ray Lankester:--\r\n\r\n\"I think you will be glad to hear, as a proof of the increasing\r\nliberality of England, that my book has sold wonderfully ... and as yet\r\nno abuse (though some, no doubt, will come, strong enough), and only\r\ncontempt even in the poor old _Athenaeum_.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time he wrote to Mr. Murray:--\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks for the _Nonconformist_ [March 8, 1871]. I like to see all\r\nthat is written, and it is of some real use. If you hear of reviewers in\r\nout-of-the-way papers, especially the religious, as _Record_,\r\n_Guardian_, _Tablet_, kindly inform me. It is wonderful that there has\r\nbeen no abuse as yet. On the whole, the reviews have been highly\r\nfavourable.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter to Mr. Murray (April 13, 1871)\r\nrefers to a review in the _Times_[250]:--\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea who wrote the _Times'_ review. He has no knowledge of\r\nscience, and seems to me a wind-bag full of metaphysics and classics, so\r\nthat I do not much regard his adverse judgment, though I suppose it will\r\ninjure the sale.\"\r\n\r\nA striking review appeared in the _Saturday Review_ (March 4 and 11,\r\n1871) in which the position of Evolution is well stated.\r\n\r\n\"He claims to have brought man himself, his origin and constitution,\r\nwithin that unity which he had previously sought to trace through all\r\nlower animal forms. The growth of opinion in the interval, due in chief\r\nmeasure to his own intermediate works, has placed the discussion of this\r\nproblem in a position very much in advance of that held by it fifteen\r\nyears ago. The problem of Evolution is hardly any longer to be treated\r\nas one of first principles: nor has Mr. Darwin to do battle for a first\r\nhearing of his central hypothesis, upborne as it is by a phalanx of\r\nnames full of distinction and promise in either hemisphere.\"\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the history of the general principle of Evolution.\r\nAt the beginning of 1869[251] he was at work on the fifth edition of\r\nthe _Origin_. The most important alterations were suggested by a\r\nremarkable paper in the _North British Review_ (June, 1867) written by\r\nthe late Fleeming Jenkin.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that the criticisms, which my father, as I\r\nbelieve, felt to be the most valuable ever made on his views should have\r\ncome, not from a professed naturalist but from a Professor of\r\nEngineering.\r\n\r\nThe point on which Fleeming Jenkin convinced my father is the extreme\r\ndifficulty of believing that _single individuals_ which differ from\r\ntheir fellows in the possession of some useful character can be the\r\nstarting point of a new variety. Thus the origin of a new variety is\r\nmore likely to be found in a species which presents the incipient\r\ncharacter in a large number of its individuals. This point of view was\r\nof course perfectly familiar to him, it was this that induced him to\r\nstudy \"unconscious selection,\" where a breed is formed by the\r\nlong-continued preservation by Man of all those individuals which are\r\nbest adapted to his needs: not as in the art of the professed breeder,\r\nwhere a single individual is picked out to breed from.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give in a short compass an account of Fleeming\r\nJenkin's argument. My father's copy of the paper (ripped out of the\r\nvolume as usual, and tied with a bit of string) is annotated in pencil\r\nin many places. I quote a passage opposite which my father has written\r\n\"good sneers\"--but it should be remembered that he used the word \"sneer\"\r\nin rather a special sense, not as necessarily implying a feeling of\r\nbitterness in the critic, but rather in the sense of \"banter.\" Speaking\r\nof the \"true believer,\" Fleeming Jenkin says, p. 293:--\r\n\r\n\"He can invent trains of ancestors of whose existence there is no\r\nevidence; he can marshal hosts of equally imaginary foes; he can call up\r\ncontinents, floods, and peculiar atmospheres; he can dry up oceans,\r\nsplit islands, and parcel out eternity at will; surely with these\r\nadvantages he must be a dull fellow if he cannot scheme some series of\r\nanimals and circumstances explaining our assumed difficulty quite\r\nnaturally. Feeling the difficulty of dealing with adversaries who\r\ncommand so huge a domain of fancy, we will abandon these arguments, and\r\ntrust to those which at least cannot be assailed by mere efforts of\r\nimagination.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fifth edition of the _Origin_, my father altered a passage in the\r\nHistorical Sketch (fourth edition, p. xviii.). He thus practically gave\r\nup the difficult task of understanding whether or not Sir R. Owen claims\r\nto have discovered the principle of Natural Selection. Adding, \"As far\r\nas the more enunciation of the principle of Natural Selection is\r\nconcerned, it is quite immaterial whether or not Professor Owen preceded\r\nme, for both of us ... were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells and Mr.\r\nMatthew.\"\r\n\r\nThe desire that his views might spread in France was always strong with\r\nmy father, and he was therefore justly annoyed to find that in 1869 the\r\npublisher of the French edition had brought out a third edition without\r\nconsulting the author. He was accordingly glad to enter into an\r\narrangement for a French translation of the fifth edition; this was\r\nundertaken by M. Reinwald, with whom he continued to have pleasant\r\nrelations as the publisher of many of his books in French.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I must enjoy myself and tell you about Mdlle. C. Royer, who translated\r\nthe _Origin_ into French, and for whose second edition I took infinite\r\ntrouble. She has now just brought out a third edition without informing\r\nme, so that all the corrections, &c., in the fourth and fifth English\r\neditions are lost. Besides her enormously long preface to the first\r\nedition, she has added a second preface abusing me like a pickpocket for\r\nPangenesis, which of course has no relation to the _Origin_. So I wrote\r\nto Paris; and Reinwald agrees to bring out at once a new translation\r\nfrom the fifth English edition, in competition with her third\r\nedition.... This fact shows that 'evolution of species' must at last be\r\nspreading in France.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be well perhaps to place here all that remains to be said about\r\nthe _Origin of Species_. The sixth or final edition was published in\r\nJanuary 1872 in a smaller and cheaper form than its predecessors. The\r\nchief addition was a discussion suggested by Mr. Mivart's _Genesis of\r\nSpecies_, which appeared in 1871, before the publication of the _Descent\r\nof Man_. The following quotation from a letter to Wallace (July 9, 1871)\r\nmay serve to show the spirit and method in which Mr. Mivart dealt with\r\nthe subject. \"I grieve to see the omission of the words by Mivart,\r\ndetected by Wright.[252] I complained to Mivart that in two cases he\r\nquotes only the commencement of sentences by me, and thus modifies my\r\nmeaning; but I never supposed he would have omitted words. There are\r\nother cases of what I consider unfair treatment.\"\r\n\r\nMy father continues, with his usual charity and moderation:--\r\n\r\n\"I conclude with sorrow that though he means to be honourable, he is so\r\nbigoted that he cannot act fairly.\"\r\n\r\nIn July 1871, my father wrote to Mr. Wallace:--\r\n\r\n\"I feel very doubtful how far I shall succeed in answering Mivart, it is\r\nso difficult to answer objections to doubtful points, and make the\r\ndiscussion readable. I shall make only a selection. The worst of it is,\r\nthat I cannot possibly hunt through all my references for isolated\r\npoints, it would take me three weeks of intolerably hard work. I wish I\r\nhad your power of arguing clearly. At present I feel sick of everything,\r\nand if I could occupy my time and forget my daily discomforts, or rather\r\nmiseries, I would never publish another word. But I shall cheer up, I\r\ndare say, soon, having only just got over a bad attack. Farewell; God\r\nknows why I bother you about myself. I can say nothing more about\r\nmissing-links than what I have said. I should rely much on pre-silurian\r\ntimes; but then comes Sir W. Thomson like an odious spectre.[253]\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\" ... There is a most cutting review of me in the [July] _Quarterly_; I\r\nhave only read a few pages. The skill and style make me think of Mivart.\r\nI shall soon be viewed as the most despicable of men. This _Quarterly\r\nReview_ tempts me to republish Ch. Wright,[254] even if not read by any\r\none, just to show some one will say a word against Mivart, and that his\r\n(_i.e._ Mivart's) remarks ought not to be swallowed without some\r\nreflection.... God knows whether my strength and spirit will last out to\r\nwrite a chapter versus Mivart and others; I do so hate controversy and\r\nfeel I shall do it so badly.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Quarterly_ review was the subject of an article by Mr. Huxley in\r\nthe November number of the _Contemporary Review_. Here, also, are\r\ndiscussed Mr. Wallace's _Contribution to the Theory of Natural\r\nSelection_, and the second edition of Mr. Mivart's _Genesis of\r\nSpecies_. What follows is taken from Mr. Huxley's article. The\r\n_Quarterly_ reviewer, though to some extent an evolutionist, believes\r\nthat Man \"differs more from an elephant or a gorilla, than do these from\r\nthe dust of the earth on which they tread.\" The reviewer also declares\r\nthat Darwin has \"with needless opposition, set at naught the first\r\nprinciples of both philosophy and religion.\" Mr. Huxley passes from the\r\n_Quarterly_ reviewer's further statement, that there is no necessary\r\nopposition between evolution and religion, to the more definite position\r\ntaken by Mr. Mivart, that the orthodox authorities of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch agree in distinctly asserting derivative creation, so that \"their\r\nteachings harmonize with all that modern science can possibly require.\"\r\nHere Mr. Huxley felt the want of that \"study of Christian philosophy\"\r\n(at any rate, in its Jesuitic garb), which Mr. Mivart speaks of, and it\r\nwas a want he at once set to work to fill up. He was then staying at St.\r\nAndrews, whence he wrote to my father:--\r\n\r\n\"By great good luck there is an excellent library here, with a good copy\r\nof Suarez,[255] in a dozen big folios. Among these I dived, to the great\r\nastonishment of the librarian, and looking into them 'as careful robins\r\neye the delver's toil' (_vide Idylls_), I carried off the two venerable\r\nclasped volumes which were most promising.\" Even those who know Mr.\r\nHuxley's unrivalled power of tearing the heart out of a book must marvel\r\nat the skill with which he has made Suarez speak on his side. \"So I have\r\ncome out,\" he wrote, \"in the new character of a defender of Catholic\r\northodoxy, and upset Mivart out of the mouth of his own prophet.\"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Mr. Huxley's critique is largely occupied with a\r\ndissection of the _Quarterly_ reviewer's psychology, and his ethical\r\nviews. He deals, too, with Mr. Wallace's objections to the doctrine of\r\nEvolution by natural causes when applied to the mental faculties of Man.\r\nFinally, he devotes a couple of pages to justifying his description of\r\nthe _Quarterly_ reviewer's treatment of Mr. Darwin as alike \"unjust and\r\nunbecoming.\"[256]\r\n\r\nIn the sixth edition my father also referred to the \"direct action of\r\nthe conditions of life\" as a subordinate cause of modification in living\r\nthings: On this subject he wrote to Dr. Moritz Wagner (Oct. 13, 1876):\r\n\"In my opinion the greatest error which I have committed, has been not\r\nallowing sufficient weight to the direct action of the environment,\r\n_i.e._ food, climate, &c., independently of natural selection.\r\nModifications thus caused, which are neither of advantage nor\r\ndisadvantage to the modified organism, would be especially favoured, as\r\nI can now see chiefly through your observations, by isolation, in a\r\nsmall area, where only a few individuals lived under nearly uniform\r\nconditions.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that such statements indicate a serious change of\r\nfront on my father's part. As a matter of fact the first edition of the\r\n_Origin_ contains the words, \"I am convinced that natural selection has\r\nbeen the main but not the exclusive means of modification.\" Moreover,\r\nany alteration that his views may have undergone was due not to a change\r\nof opinion, but to change in the materials on which a judgment was to be\r\nformed. Thus he wrote to Wagner in the above quoted letter:--\r\n\r\n\"When I wrote the _Origin_, and for some years afterwards, I could find\r\nlittle good evidence of the direct action of the environment; now there\r\nis a large body of evidence.\"\r\n\r\nWith the possibility of such action of the environment he had of course\r\nbeen familiar for many years. Thus he wrote to Mr. Davidson in 1861:--\r\n\r\n\"My greatest trouble is, not being able to weigh the direct effects of\r\nthe long-continued action of changed conditions of life without any\r\nselection, with the action of selection on mere accidental (so to speak)\r\nvariability. I oscillate much on this head, but generally return to my\r\nbelief that the direct action of the conditions of life has not been\r\ngreat. At least this direct action can have played an extremely small\r\npart in producing all the numberless and beautiful adaptations in every\r\nliving creature.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Sir Joseph Hooker in the following year:--\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know why I am a little sorry, but my present work is leading\r\nme to believe rather more in the direct action of physical conditions. I\r\npresume I regret it, because it lessens the glory of Natural Selection,\r\nand is so confoundedly doubtful. Perhaps I shall change again when I get\r\nall my facts under one point of view, and a pretty hard job this will\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the growth of his book on the\r\n_Expression of the Emotions_ out of a projected chapter in the _Descent\r\nof Man_.\r\n\r\nIt was published in the autumn of 1872. The edition consisted of 7000,\r\nand of these 5267 copies were sold at Mr. Murray's sale in November. Two\r\nthousand were printed at the end of the year, and this proved a\r\nmisfortune, as they did not afterwards sell so rapidly, and thus a mass\r\nof notes collected by the author was never employed for a second edition\r\nduring his lifetime.[257]\r\n\r\nAs usual he had no belief in the possibility of the book being generally\r\nsuccessful. The following passage in a letter to Haeckel serves to show\r\nthat he had felt the writing of this book as a somewhat severe strain:--\r\n\r\n\"I have finished my little book on Expression, and when it is published\r\nin November I will of course send you a copy, in case you would like to\r\nread it for amusement. I have resumed some old botanical work, and\r\nperhaps I shall never again attempt to discuss theoretical views.\r\n\r\n\"I am growing old and weak, and no man can tell when his intellectual\r\npowers begin to fail. Long life and happiness to you for your own sake\r\nand for that of science.\"\r\n\r\nA good review by Mr. Wallace appeared in the _Quarterly Journal of\r\nScience_, Jan. 1873. Mr. Wallace truly remarks that the book exhibits\r\ncertain \"characteristics of the author's mind in an eminent degree,\"\r\nnamely, \"the insatiable longing to discover the causes of the varied and\r\ncomplex phenomena presented by living things.\" He adds that in the case\r\nof the author \"the restless curiosity of the child to know the 'what\r\nfor?' the 'why?' and the 'how?' of everything\" seems \"never to have\r\nabated its force.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of the Expression book was the occasion of the following\r\nletter to one of his oldest friends, the late Mrs. Haliburton, who was\r\nthe daughter of a Shropshire neighbour, Mr. Owen of Woodhouse, and\r\nbecame the wife of the author of _Sam Slick_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNov. 1, 1872.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. HALIBURTON,--I dare say you will be surprised to hear from\r\nme. My object in writing now is to say that I have just published a\r\nbook on the _Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals_; and it has\r\noccurred to me that you might possibly like to read some parts of it;\r\nand I can hardly think that this would have been the case with any of\r\nthe books which I have already published. So I send by this post my\r\npresent book. Although I have had no communication with you or the other\r\nmembers of your family for so long a time, no scenes in my whole life\r\npass so frequently or so vividly before my mind as those which relate to\r\nhappy old days spent at Woodhouse. I should very much like to hear a\r\nlittle news about yourself and the other members of your family, if you\r\nwill take the trouble to write to me. Formerly I used to glean some news\r\nabout you from my sisters.\r\n\r\nI have had many years of bad health and have not been able to visit\r\nanywhere; and now I feel very old. As long as I pass a perfectly uniform\r\nlife, I am able to do some daily work in Natural History, which is still\r\nmy passion, as it was in old days, when you used to laugh at me for\r\ncollecting beetles with such zeal at Woodhouse. Excepting from my\r\ncontinued ill-health, which has excluded me from society, my life has\r\nbeen a very happy one; the greatest drawback being that several of my\r\nchildren have inherited from me feeble health. I hope with all my heart\r\nthat you retain, at least to a large extent, the famous \"Owen\r\nconstitution.\" With sincere feelings of gratitude and affection for all\r\nbearing the name of Owen, I venture to sign myself,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately.\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[221] The Historical Sketch had already appeared in the first German\r\nedition (1860) and the American edition. Bronn states in the German\r\nedition (footnote, p. 1) that it was his critique in the _N. Jahrbuch\r\nfuer Mineralogie_ that suggested to my father the idea of such a sketch.\r\n\r\n[222] Hugh Falconer, born 1809, died 1865. Chiefly known as a\r\npalaeontologist, although employed as a botanist during his whole career\r\nin India, where he was a medical officer in the H.E.I.C. Service.\r\n\r\n[223] In his letters to Gray there are also numerous references to the\r\nAmerican war. I give a single passage. \"I never knew the newspapers so\r\nprofoundly interesting. North America does not do England justice; I\r\nhave not seen or heard of a soul who is not with the North. Some few,\r\nand I am one of them, even wish to God, though at the loss of millions\r\nof lives, that the North would proclaim a crusade against slavery. In\r\nthe long-run, a million horrid deaths would be amply repaid in the cause\r\nof humanity. What wonderful times we live in! Massachusetts seems to\r\nshow noble enthusiasm. Great God! how I should like to see the greatest\r\ncurse on earth--slavery--abolished!\"\r\n\r\n[224] This refers to the remarkable fact that many introduced European\r\nweeds have spread over large parts of the United States.\r\n\r\n[225] _Geologist_, 1861, p. 132.\r\n\r\n[226] The letter is published in a lecture by Professor Hutton given\r\nbefore the Philosoph. Institute, Canterbury, N.Z., Sept 12th, 1887.\r\n\r\n[227] Mr. Bates is perhaps most widely known through his delightful _The\r\nNaturalist on the Amazons_. It was with regard to this book that my\r\nfather wrote (April 1863) to the author:--\"I have finished vol. i. My\r\ncriticisms may be condensed into a single sentence, namely, that it is\r\nthe best work of Natural History Travels ever published in England. Your\r\nstyle seems to me admirable. Nothing can be better than the discussion\r\non the struggle for existence, and nothing better than the description\r\nof the Forest scenery. It is a grand book, and whether or not it sells\r\nquickly, it will last. You have spoken out boldly on Species; and\r\nboldness on the subject seems to get rarer and rarer. How beautifully\r\nillustrated it is.\"\r\n\r\n[228] Mr. Bates' paper, 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazons\r\nValley' (_Linn. Soc. Trans._ xxiii. 1862), in which the now familiar\r\nsubject of mimicry was founded. My father wrote a short review of it in\r\nthe _Natural History Review_, 1863, p. 219, parts of which occur almost\r\nverbatim in the later editions of the _Origin of Species_. A striking\r\npassage occurs in the review, showing the difficulties of the case from\r\na creationist's point of view:--\r\n\r\n\"By what means, it may be asked, have so many butterflies of the\r\nAmazonian region acquired their deceptive dress? Most naturalists will\r\nanswer that they were thus clothed from the hour of their creation--an\r\nanswer which will generally be so far triumphant that it can be met only\r\nby long-drawn arguments; but it is made at the expense of putting an\r\neffectual bar to all further inquiry. In this particular case, moreover,\r\nthe creationist will meet with special difficulties; for many of the\r\nmimicking forms of _Leptalis_ can be shown by a graduated series to be\r\nmerely varieties of one species; other mimickers are undoubtedly\r\ndistinct species, or even distinct genera. So again, some of the\r\nmimicked forms can be shown to be merely varieties; but the greater\r\nnumber must be ranked as distinct species. Hence the creationist will\r\nhave to admit that some of these forms have become imitators, by means\r\nof the laws of variation, whilst others he must look at as separately\r\ncreated under their present guise; he will further have to admit that\r\nsome have been created in imitation of forms not themselves created as\r\nwe now see them, but due to the laws of variation! Professor Agassiz,\r\nindeed, would think nothing of this difficulty; for he believes that not\r\nonly each species and each variety, but that groups of individuals,\r\nthough identically the same, when inhabiting distinct countries, have\r\nbeen all separately created in due proportional numbers to the wants of\r\neach land. Not many naturalists will be content thus to believe that\r\nvarieties and individuals have been turned out all ready made, almost as\r\na manufacturer turns out toys according to the temporary demand of the\r\nmarket.\"\r\n\r\n[229] Mr. Huxley was as usual active in guiding and stimulating the\r\ngrowing tendency to tolerate or accept the views set forth in the\r\n_Origin of Species_. He gave a series of lectures to working men at the\r\nSchool of Mines in November, 1862. These were printed in 1863 from the\r\nshorthand notes of Mr. May, as six little blue books, price 4_d._ each,\r\nunder the title, _Our Knowledge of the Causes of Organic Nature_.\r\n\r\n[230] Kingsley's _Life_, vol. ii. p. 171.\r\n\r\n[231] In the _Antiquity of Man_, first edition, p. 480, Lyell criticised\r\nsomewhat severely Owen's account of the difference between the Human and\r\nSimian brains. The number of the _Athenaeum_ here referred to (1863, p.\r\n262) contains a reply by Professor Owen to Lyell's strictures. The\r\nsurprise expressed by my father was at the revival of a controversy\r\nwhich every one believed to be closed. Professor Huxley (_Medical\r\nTimes_, Oct. 25th, 1862, quoted in _Man's Place in Nature_, p. 117)\r\nspoke of the \"two years during which this preposterous controversy has\r\ndragged its weary length.\" And this no doubt expressed a very general\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n[232] The italics are not Lyell's.\r\n\r\n[233] _The Antiquity of Man._\r\n\r\n[234] \"Falconer, whom I [Lyell] referred to oftener than to any other\r\nauthor, says I have not done justice to the part he took in\r\nresuscitating the cave question, and says he shall come out with a\r\nseparate paper to prove it.

If either of the gravel sifters or stone breakers found anything,\r\nhe was obliged to conceal it immediately, or one of the old bone\r\ncollectors would be sure to appropriate it first and deny the theft\r\nafterwards, and the consequent wrangling and disputes were as endless as\r\nthey were wearisome.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Mayor.--Probably the clergyman of the parish might exert some\r\ninfluence over them?\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman smiled, shook his head, and stated that he regretted to\r\nsay that no class of men paid so little attention to the opinions of the\r\nclergy as that to which these unhappy men belonged.\"\r\n\r\n[238] No doubt Haeckel, whose monograph on the Radiolaria was published\r\nin 1862.\r\n\r\n[239] The Marquis de Saporta.\r\n\r\n[240] _Examen du livre de M.

D. Hooker (June 22nd):--\r\n\r\n\"We have been here for ten days, how I wish it was possible for you to\r\npay us a visit here; we have a beautiful house with a terraced garden,\r\nand a really magnificent view of Cader, right opposite.

I thank you most cordially for your generous defence of me\r\nagainst Mr. Mivart. In the _Origin_ I did not discuss the derivation of\r\nany one species; but that I might not be accused of concealing my\r\nopinion, I went out of my way, and inserted a sentence which seemed to\r\nme (and still so seems) to disclose plainly my belief. This was quoted\r\nin my _Descent of Man_. Therefore it is very unjust ... of Mr. Mivart to\r\naccuse me of base fraudulent concealment.\"\r\n\r\n[257] They were utilised to some extent in the 2nd edition, edited by\r\nme, and published in 1890.--F. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEA.--REVIVAL OF GEOLOGICAL WORK.--THE VIVISECTION\r\nQUESTION.--HONOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1874 a second edition of his _Coral Reefs_ was published, which need\r\nnot specially concern us. It was not until some time afterwards that the\r\ncriticisms of my father's theory appeared, which have attracted a good\r\ndeal of attention.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of the subject is taken from\r\nProfessor's Judd's \"Critical Introduction\" to Messrs. Ward, Lock and\r\nCo's. edition of _Coral Reefs_ and _Volcanic Islands, &c._[258]\r\n\r\n\"The first serious note of dissent to the generally accepted theory was\r\nheard in 1863, when a distinguished German naturalist, Dr. Karl Semper,\r\ndeclared that his study of the Pelew Islands showed that uninterrupted\r\nsubsidence could not have been going on in that region. Dr. Semper's\r\nobjections were very carefully considered by Mr. Darwin, and a reply to\r\nthem appeared in the second and revised edition of his _Coral Reefs_,\r\nwhich was published in 1874. With characteristic frankness and freedom\r\nfrom prejudices, Darwin admitted that the facts brought forward by Dr.\r\nSemper proved that in certain specified cases, subsidence could not have\r\nplayed the chief part in originating the peculiar forms of the coral\r\nislands. But while making this admission, he firmly maintained that\r\nexceptional cases, like those described in the Pelew Islands, were not\r\nsufficient to invalidate the theory of subsidence as applied to the\r\nwidely spread atolls, encircling reefs, and barrier-reefs of the Pacific\r\nand Indian Oceans. It is worthy of note that to the end of his life\r\nDarwin maintained a friendly correspondence with Semper concerning the\r\npoints on which they were at issue.\r\n\r\n\"After the appearance of Semper's work, Dr. J. J. Rein published an\r\naccount of the Bermudas, in which he opposed the interpretation of the\r\nstructure of the islands given by Nelson and other authors, and\r\nmaintained that the facts observed in them are opposed to the views of\r\nDarwin. Although so far as I am aware, Darwin had no opportunity of\r\nstudying and considering these particular objections, it may be\r\nmentioned that two American geologists have since carefully re-examined\r\nthe district--Professor W. N. Rice in 1884 and Professor A. Heilprin in\r\n1889--and they have independently arrived at the conclusion that Dr.\r\nRein's objections cannot be maintained.\r\n\r\n\"The most serious objection to Darwin's coral-reef theory, however, was\r\nthat which developed itself after the return of H.M.S. _Challenger_ from\r\nher famous voyage. Mr. John Murray, one of the staff of naturalists on\r\nboard that vessel, propounded a new theory of coral-reefs, and\r\nmaintained that the view that they were formed by subsidence was one\r\nthat was no longer tenable; these objections have been supported by\r\nProfessor Alexander Agassiz in the United States, and by Dr. A. Geikie,\r\nand Dr. H. B. Guppy in this country.\r\n\r\n\"Although Mr. Darwin did not live to bring out a third edition of his\r\n_Coral Reefs_, I know from several conversations with him that he had\r\ngiven the most patient and thoughtful consideration to Mr. Murray's\r\npaper on the subject. He admitted to me that had he known, when he wrote\r\nhis work, of the abundant deposition of the remains of calcareous\r\norganisms on the sea floor, he might have regarded this cause as\r\nsufficient in a few cases to raise the summit of submerged volcanoes or\r\nother mountains to a level at which reef-forming corals can commence to\r\nflourish. But he did not think that the admission that under certain\r\nfavourable conditions, atolls might be thus formed without subsidence,\r\nnecessitated an abandonment of his theory in the case of the innumerable\r\nexamples of the kind which stud the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\r\n\r\n\"A letter written by Darwin to Professor Alexander Agassiz in May 1881,\r\nshows exactly the attitude which careful consideration of the subject\r\nled him to maintain towards the theory propounded by Mr. Murray:--\r\n\r\n\"'You will have seen,' he writes, 'Mr. Murray's views on the formation\r\nof atolls and barrier reefs. Before publishing my book, I thought long\r\nover the same view, but only as far as ordinary marine organisms are\r\nconcerned, for at that time little was known of the multitude of minute\r\noceanic organisms. I rejected this view, as from the few dredgings made\r\nin the _Beagle_, in the south temperate regions, I concluded that\r\nshells, the smaller corals, &c., decayed, and were dissolved, when not\r\nprotected by the deposition of sediment, and sediment could not\r\naccumulate in the open ocean. Certainly, shells, &c., were in several\r\ncases completely rotten, and crumbled into mud between my fingers; but\r\nyou will know well whether this is in any degree common. I have\r\nexpressly said that a bank at the proper depth would give rise to an\r\natoll, which could not be distinguished from one formed during\r\nsubsidence. I can, however, hardly believe in the former presence of as\r\nmany banks (there having been no subsidence) as there are atolls in the\r\ngreat oceans, within a reasonable depth, on which minute oceanic\r\norganisms could have accumulated to the thickness of many hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\"Darwin's concluding words in the same letter written within a year of\r\nhis death, are a striking proof of the candour and openness of mind\r\nwhich he preserved so well to the end, in this as in other\r\ncontroversies.\r\n\r\n\"'If I am wrong, the sooner I am knocked on the head and annihilated so\r\nmuch the better. It still seems to me a marvellous thing that there\r\nshould not have been much, and long continued, subsidence in the beds of\r\nthe great oceans. I wish that some doubly rich millionaire would take it\r\ninto his head to have borings made in some of the Pacific and Indian\r\natolls, and bring home cores for slicing from a depth of 500 or 600\r\nfeet.'\r\n\r\n\"It is noteworthy that the objections to Darwin's theory have for the\r\nmost part proceeded from zoologists, while those who have fully\r\nappreciated the geological aspect of the question have been the\r\nstaunchest supporters of the theory of subsidence. The desirability of\r\nsuch boring operations in atolls has been insisted upon by several\r\ngeologists, and it may be hoped that before many years have passed away,\r\nDarwin's hopes may be realised, either with or without the intervention\r\nof the 'doubly rich millionaire.'\r\n\r\n\"Three years after the death of Darwin, the veteran Professor Dana\r\nre-entered the lists and contributed a powerful defence of the theory of\r\nsubsidence in the form of a reply to an essay written by the ablest\r\nexponent of the anti-Darwinian views on this subject, Dr. A. Geikie.\r\nWhile pointing out that the Darwinian position had been to a great\r\nextent misunderstood by its opponents, he showed that the rival theory\r\npresented even greater difficulties than those which it professed to\r\nremove.\r\n\r\n\"During the last five years, the whole question of the origin of\r\ncoral-reefs and islands has been re-opened, and a controversy has\r\narisen, into which, unfortunately, acrimonious elements have been very\r\nunnecessarily introduced. Those who desire it, will find clear and\r\nimpartial statements of the varied and often mutually destructive views\r\nput forward by different authors, in three works which have made their\r\nappearance within the last year--_The Bermuda Islands_, by Professor\r\nAngelo Heilprin: _Corals and Coral Islands_, new edition by Professor J.\r\nD. Dana; and the third edition of Darwin's _Coral-Reefs_, with Notes and\r\nAppendix by Professor T. G. Bonney.\r\n\r\n\"Most readers will, I think, rise from the perusal of these works with\r\nthe conviction that, while on certain points of detail it is clear that,\r\nthrough the want of knowledge concerning the action of marine organisms\r\nin the open ocean, Darwin was betrayed into some grave errors, yet the\r\nmain foundations of his argument have not been seriously impaired by the\r\nnew facts observed in the deep-sea researches, or by the severe\r\ncriticisms to which his theory has been subjected during the last ten\r\nyears. On the other hand, I think it will appear that much\r\nmisapprehension has been exhibited by some of Darwin's critics, as to\r\nwhat his views and arguments really were; so that the reprint and wide\r\ncirculation of the book in its original form is greatly to be desired,\r\nand cannot but be attended with advantage to all those who will have the\r\nfairness to acquaint themselves with Darwin's views at first hand,\r\nbefore attempting to reply to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe only important geological work of my father's later years is\r\nembodied in his book on earthworms (1881), which may therefore be\r\nconveniently considered in this place. This subject was one which had\r\ninterested him many years before this date, and in 1838 a paper on the\r\nformation of mould was published in the _Proceedings of the Geological\r\nSociety_.\r\n\r\nHere he showed that \"fragments of burnt marl, cinders, &c., which had\r\nbeen thickly strewed over the surface of several meadows were found\r\nafter a few years lying at a depth of some inches beneath the turf, but\r\nstill forming a layer.\" For the explanation of this fact, which forms\r\nthe central idea of the geological part of the book, he was indebted to\r\nhis uncle Josiah Wedgwood, who suggested that worms, by bringing earth\r\nto the surface in their castings, must undermine any objects lying on\r\nthe surface and cause an apparent sinking.\r\n\r\nIn the book of 1881 he extended his observations on this burying action,\r\nand devised a number of different ways of checking his estimates as to\r\nthe amount of work done. He also added a mass of observations on the\r\nnatural history and intelligence of worms, a part of the work which\r\nadded greatly to its popularity.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Sir Thomas Farrer had discovered close to his garden the remains\r\nof a building of Roman-British times, and thus gave my father the\r\nopportunity of seeing for himself the effects produced by earthworms on\r\nthe old concrete floors, walls, &c. On his return he wrote to Sir Thomas\r\nFarrer:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot remember a more delightful week than the last. I know very\r\nwell that E. will not believe me, but the worms were by no means the\r\nsole charm.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1880, when the _Power of Movement in Plants_ was nearly\r\nfinished, he began once more on the subject. He wrote to Professor Carus\r\n(September 21):--\r\n\r\n\"In the intervals of correcting the press, I am writing a very little\r\nbook, and have done nearly half of it. Its title will be (as at present\r\ndesigned), _The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of\r\nWorms_.[259] As far as I can judge, it will be a curious little book.\"\r\n\r\nThe manuscript was sent to the printers in April 1881, and when the\r\nproof-sheets were coming in he wrote to Professor Carus: \"The subject\r\nhas been to me a hobby-horse, and I have perhaps treated it in foolish\r\ndetail.\"\r\n\r\nIt was published on October 10, and 2000 copies were sold at once. He\r\nwrote to Sir J. D. Hooker, \"I am glad that you approve of the _Worms_.\r\nWhen in old days I used to tell you whatever I was doing, if you were at\r\nall interested, I always felt as most men do when their work is finally\r\npublished.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Mellard Reade he wrote (November 8): \"It has been a complete\r\nsurprise to me how many persons have cared for the subject.\" And to Mr.\r\nDyer (in November): \"My book has been received with almost laughable\r\nenthusiasm, and 3500 copies have been sold!!!\" Again to his friend Mr.\r\nAnthony Rich, he wrote on February 4, 1882, \"I have been plagued with an\r\nendless stream of letters on the subject; most of them very foolish and\r\nenthusiastic; but some containing good facts which I have used in\r\ncorrecting yesterday the _Sixth Thousand_.\" The popularity of the book\r\nmay be roughly estimated by the fact that, in the three years following\r\nits publication, 8500 copies were sold--a sale relatively greater than\r\nthat of the _Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to account for its success with the non-scientific\r\npublic. Conclusions so wide and so novel, and so easily understood,\r\ndrawn from the study of creatures so familiar, and treated with unabated\r\nvigour and freshness, may well have attracted many readers. A reviewer\r\nremarks: \"In the eyes of most men ... the earthworm is a mere blind,\r\ndumbsenseless, and unpleasantly slimy annelid. Mr. Darwin under-takes\r\nto rehabilitate his character, and the earthworm steps forth at once as\r\nan intelligent and beneficent personage, a worker of vast geological\r\nchanges, a planer down of mountain sides ... a friend of man ... and an\r\nally of the Society for the preservation of ancient monuments.\" The _St.\r\nJames's Gazette_, of October 17th, 1881, pointed out that the teaching\r\nof the cumulative importance of the infinitely little is the point of\r\ncontact between this book and the author's previous work.\r\n\r\nOne more book remains to be noticed, the _Life of Erasmus Darwin_.\r\n\r\nIn February 1879 an essay by Dr. Ernst Krause, on the scientific work of\r\nErasmus Darwin, appeared in the evolutionary journal, _Kosmos_. The\r\nnumber of _Kosmos_ in question was a \"Gratulationsheft,\"[260] or special\r\ncongratulatory issue in honour of my father's birthday, so that Dr.\r\nKrause's essay, glorifying the older evolutionist, was quite in its\r\nplace. He wrote to Dr. Krause, thanking him cordially for the honour\r\npaid to Erasmus, and asking his permission to publish an English\r\ntranslation of the Essay.\r\n\r\nHis chief reason for writing a notice of his grandfather's life was \"to\r\ncontradict flatly some calumnies by Miss Seward.\" This appears from a\r\nletter of March 27, 1879, to his cousin Reginald Darwin, in which he\r\nasks for any documents and letters which might throw light on the\r\ncharacter of Erasmus. This led to Mr. Reginald Darwin placing in my\r\nfather's hands a quantity of valuable material, including a curious\r\nfolio common-place book, of which he wrote: \"I have been deeply\r\ninterested by the great book, ... reading and looking at it is like\r\nhaving communion with the dead ... [it] has taught me a good deal about\r\nthe occupations and tastes of our grandfather.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Krause's contribution formed the second part of the _Life of Erasmus\r\nDarwin_, my father supplying a \"preliminary notice.\" This expression on\r\nthe title-page is somewhat misleading; my father's contribution is more\r\nthan half the book, and should have been described as a biography. Work\r\nof this kind was new to him, and he wrote doubtfully to Mr. Thiselton\r\nDyer, June 18th: \"God only knows what I shall make of his life, it is\r\nsuch a new kind of work to me.\" The strong interest he felt about his\r\nforbears helped to give zest to the work, which became a decided\r\nenjoyment to him. With the general public the book was not markedly\r\nsuccessful, but many of his friends recognised its merits. Sir J. D.\r\nHooker was one of these, and to him my father wrote, \"Your praise of the\r\nLife of Dr. D. has pleased me exceedingly, for I despised my work, and\r\nthought myself a perfect fool to have undertaken such a job.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Galton, too, he wrote, November 14:--\r\n\r\n\"I am extremely glad that you approve of the little _Life_ of our\r\ngrandfather, for I have been repenting that I ever undertook it, as the\r\nwork was quite beyond my tether.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIVISECTION QUESTION.\r\n\r\nSomething has already been said of my father's strong feeling with\r\nregard to suffering[261] both in man and beast. It was indeed one of the\r\nstrongest feelings in his nature, and was exemplified in matters small\r\nand great, in his sympathy with the educational miseries of dancing\r\ndogs, or his horror at the sufferings of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of screams, or other sounds heard in Brazil, when he was\r\npowerless to interfere with what he believed to be the torture of a\r\nslave, haunted him for years, especially at night. In smaller matters,\r\nwhere he could interfere, he did so vigorously. He returned one day from\r\nhis walk pale and faint from having seen a horse ill-used, and from the\r\nagitation of violently remonstrating with the man. On another occasion\r\nhe saw a horse-breaker teaching his son to ride; the little boy was\r\nfrightened and the man was rough; my father stopped, and jumping out of\r\nthe carriage reproved the man in no measured terms.\r\n\r\nOne other little incident may be mentioned, showing that his humanity to\r\nanimals was well known in his own neighbourhood. A visitor, driving from\r\nOrpington to Down, told the cabman to go faster. \"Why,\" said the man,\r\n\"if I had whipped the horse _this_ much, driving Mr. Darwin, he would\r\nhave got out of the carriage and abused me well.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the special point under consideration,--the sufferings\r\nof animals subjected to experiment,--nothing could show a stronger\r\nfeeling than the following words from a letter to Professor Ray\r\nLankester (March 22, 1871):--\r\n\r\n\"You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is\r\njustifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere\r\ndamnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick\r\nwith horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not\r\nsleep to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Vivisection agitation, to which the following letters refer,\r\nseems to have become specially active in 1874, as may be seen, _e.g._ by\r\nthe index to _Nature_ for that year, in which the word \"Vivisection\"\r\nsuddenly comes into prominence. But before that date the subject had\r\nreceived the earnest attention of biologists. Thus at the Liverpool\r\nMeeting of the British Association in 1870, a Committee was appointed,\r\nwhose report defined the circumstances and conditions under which, in\r\nthe opinion of the signatories, experiments on living animals were\r\njustifiable. In the spring of 1875, Lord Hartismere introduced a Bill\r\ninto the Upper House to regulate the course of physiological research.\r\nShortly afterwards a Bill more just towards science in its provisions\r\nwas introduced to the House of Commons by Messrs. Lyon Playfair,\r\nWalpole, and Ashley. It was, however, withdrawn on the appointment of a\r\nRoyal Commission to inquire into the whole question. The Commissioners\r\nwere Lords Cardwell and Winmarleigh, Mr. W. E. Forster, Sir J. B.\r\nKarslake, Mr. Huxley, Professor Erichssen, and Mr. R. H. Hutton: they\r\ncommenced their inquiry in July, 1875, and the Report was published\r\nearly in the following year.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1876, Lord Carnarvon's Bill, entitled, \"An Act to\r\namend the Law relating to Cruelty to Animals,\" was introduced. The\r\nframers of this Bill, yielding to the unreasonable clamour of the\r\npublic, went far beyond the recommendations of the Royal Commission. As\r\na correspondent writes in _Nature_ (1876, p. 248), \"the evidence on the\r\nstrength of which legislation was recommended went beyond the facts, the\r\nReport went beyond the evidence, the Recommendations beyond the Report;\r\nand the Bill can hardly be said to have gone beyond the Recommendations;\r\nbut rather to have contradicted them.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislation which my father worked for, was practically what was\r\nintroduced as Dr. Lyon Playfair's Bill.\r\n\r\nThe following letter appeared in the Times, April 18th, 1881:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Frithiof Holmgren._[262] Down, April 14, 1881.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In answer to your courteous letter of April 7, I have no\r\nobjection to express my opinion with respect to the right of\r\nexperimenting on living animals. I use this latter expression as more\r\ncorrect and comprehensive than that of vivisection. You are at liberty\r\nto make any use of this letter which you may think fit, but if published\r\nI should wish the whole to appear. I have all my life been a strong\r\nadvocate for humanity to animals, and have done what I could in my\r\nwritings to enforce this duty. Several years ago, when the agitation\r\nagainst physiologists commenced in England, it was asserted that\r\ninhumanity was here practised, and useless suffering caused to animals;\r\nand I was led to think that it might be advisable to have an Act of\r\nParliament on the subject. I then took an active part in trying to get a\r\nBill passed, such as would have removed all just cause of complaint, and\r\nat the same time have left physiologists free to pursue their\r\nresearches--a Bill very different from the Act which has since been\r\npassed. It is right to add that the investigation of the matter by a\r\nRoyal Commission proved that the accusations made against our English\r\nphysiologists were false. From all that I have heard, however, I fear\r\nthat in some parts of Europe little regard is paid to the sufferings of\r\nanimals, and if this be the case, I should be glad to hear of\r\nlegislation against inhumanity in any such country. On the other hand, I\r\nknow that physiology cannot possibly progress except by means of\r\nexperiments on living animals, and I feel the deepest conviction that he\r\nwho retards the progress of physiology commits a crime against mankind.\r\nAny one who remembers, as I can, the state of this science half a\r\ncentury ago must admit that it has made immense progress, and it is now\r\nprogressing at an ever-increasing rate. What improvements in medical\r\npractice may be directly attributed to physiological research is a\r\nquestion which can be properly discussed only by those physiologists and\r\nmedical practitioners who have studied the history of their subjects;\r\nbut, as far as I can learn, the benefits are already great. However this\r\nmay be, no one, unless he is grossly ignorant of what science has done\r\nfor mankind, can entertain any doubt of the incalculable benefits which\r\nwill hereafter be derived from physiology, not only by man, but by the\r\nlower animals. Look for instance at Pasteur's results in modifying the\r\ngerms of the most malignant diseases, from which, as it happens, animals\r\nwill in the first place receive more relief than man. Let it be\r\nremembered how many lives and what a fearful amount of suffering have\r\nbeen saved by the knowledge gained of parasitic worms through the\r\nexperiments of Virchow and others on living animals. In the future every\r\none will be astonished at the ingratitude shown, at least in England, to\r\nthese benefactors of mankind. As for myself, permit me to assure you\r\nthat I honour, and shall always honour, every one who advances the noble\r\nscience of physiology.\r\n\r\nDear Sir, yours faithfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Times_ of the following day appeared a letter headed \"Mr. Darwin\r\nand Vivisection,\" signed by Miss Frances Power Cobbe. To this my father\r\nreplied in the _Times_ of April 22, 1881. On the same day he wrote to\r\nMr. Romanes:--\r\n\r\n\"As I have a fair opportunity, I sent a letter to the _Times_ on\r\nVivisection, which is printed to-day. I thought it fair to bear my share\r\nof the abuse poured in so atrocious a manner on all physiologists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to the Editor of the 'Times.'_\r\n\r\nSIR,--I do not wish to discuss the views expressed by Miss Cobbe in the\r\nletter which appeared in the _Times_ of the 19th inst.; but as she\r\nasserts that I have \"misinformed\" my correspondent in Sweden in saying\r\nthat \"the investigation of the matter by a Royal Commission proved that\r\nthe accusations made against our English physiologists were false,\" I\r\nwill merely ask leave to refer to some other sentences from the report\r\nof the Commission.\r\n\r\n(1.) The sentence--\"It is not to be doubted that inhumanity may be found\r\nin persons of very high position as physiologists,\" which Miss Cobbe\r\nquotes from page 17 of the report, and which, in her opinion, \"can\r\nnecessarily concern English physiologists alone and not foreigners,\" is\r\nimmediately followed by the words \"We have seen that it was so in\r\nMagendie.\" Magendie was a French physiologist who became notorious some\r\nhalf century ago for his cruel experiments on living animals.\r\n\r\n(2.) The Commissioners, after speaking of the \"general sentiment of\r\nhumanity\" prevailing in this country, say (p. 10):--\r\n\r\n\"This principle is accepted generally by the very highly educated men\r\nwhose lives are devoted either to scientific investigation and education\r\nor to the mitigation or the removal of the sufferings of their\r\nfellow-creatures; though differences of degree in regard to its\r\npractical application will be easily discernible by those who study the\r\nevidence as it has been laid before us.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, according to the Commissioners (p. 10):--\r\n\r\n\"The secretary of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\nAnimals, when asked whether the general tendency of the scientific world\r\nin this country is at variance with humanity, says he believes it to be\r\nvery different indeed from that of foreign physiologists; and while\r\ngiving it as the opinion of the society that experiments are performed\r\nwhich are in their nature beyond any legitimate province of science, and\r\nthat the pain which they inflict is pain which it is not justifiable to\r\ninflict even for the scientific object in view, he readily acknowledges\r\nthat he does not know a single case of wanton cruelty, and that in\r\ngeneral the English physiologists have used anaesthetics where they think\r\nthey can do so with safety to the experiment.\"\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant.\r\n\r\nApril 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of my father's life there was a growing tendency\r\nin the public to do him honour.[263] The honours which he valued most\r\nhighly were those which united the sympathy of friends with a mark of\r\nrecognition of his scientific colleagues. Of this type was the article\r\n\"Charles Darwin,\" published in _Nature_, June 4, 1874, and written by\r\nAsa Gray. This admirable estimate of my father's work in science is\r\ngiven in the form of a comparison and contrast between Robert Brown and\r\nCharles Darwin.\r\n\r\nTo Gray he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I wrote yesterday and cannot remember exactly what I said, and now\r\ncannot be easy without again telling you how profoundly I have been\r\ngratified. Every one, I suppose, occasionally thinks that he has worked\r\nin vain, and when one of these fits overtakes me, I will think of your\r\narticle, and if that does not dispel the evil spirit, I shall know that\r\nI am at the time a little bit insane, as we all are occasionally.\r\n\r\n\"What you say about Teleology[264] pleases me especially, and I do not\r\nthink any one else has ever noticed the point. I have always said you\r\nwere the man to hit the nail on the head.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1877 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of\r\nCambridge. The degree was conferred on November 17, and with the\r\ncustomary Latin speech from the Public Orator, concluding with the\r\nwords: \"Tu vero, qui leges naturae tam docte illustraveris, legum doctor\r\nnobis esto.\"\r\n\r\nThe honorary degree led to a movement being set on foot in the\r\nUniversity to obtain some permanent memorial of my father. In June 1879\r\nhe sat to Mr. W. Richmond for the portrait in the possession of the\r\nUniversity, now placed in the Library of the Philosophical Society at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nA similar wish on the part of the Linnean Society--with which my father\r\nwas so closely associated--led to his sitting in August, 1881, to Mr.\r\nJohn Collier, for the portrait now in the possession of the Society. The\r\nportrait represents him standing facing the observer in the loose cloak\r\nso familiar to those who knew him, with his slouch hat in his hand. Many\r\nof those who knew his face most intimately, think that Mr. Collier's\r\npicture is the best of the portraits, and in this judgment the sitter\r\nhimself was inclined to agree. According to my feeling it is not so\r\nsimple or strong a representation of him as that given by Mr. Ouless.\r\nThe last-named portrait was painted at Down in 1875; it is in the\r\npossession of the family,[265] and is known to many through Rajon's fine\r\netching. Of Mr. Ouless's picture my father wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker:\r\n\r\n\"I look a very venerable, acute, melancholy old dog; whether I really\r\nlook so I do not know.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the Cambridge degree, he received about the same time honours of\r\nan academic kind from some foreign societies.\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 1878, he was elected a Corresponding Member of the French\r\nInstitute in the Botanical Section,[266] and wrote to Dr. Asa Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I see that we are both elected Corresponding Members of the Institute.\r\nIt is rather a good joke that I should be elected in the Botanical\r\nSection, as the extent of my knowledge is little more than that a daisy\r\nis a Compositous plant and a pea a Leguminous one.\"\r\n\r\nHe valued very highly two photographic albums containing portraits of a\r\nlarge number of scientific men in Germany and Holland, which he received\r\nas birthday gifts in 1877.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1878 my father received a singular mark of recognition in\r\nthe form of a letter from a stranger, announcing that the writer\r\nintended to leave to him the reversion of the greater part of his\r\nfortune. Mr. Anthony Rich, who desired thus to mark his sense of my\r\nfather's services to science, was the author of a _Dictionary of Roman\r\nand Greek Antiquities_, said to be the best book of the kind. It has\r\nbeen translated into French, German, and Italian, and has, in English,\r\ngone through several editions. Mr. Rich lived a great part of his life\r\nin Italy, painting, and collecting books and engravings. He finally\r\nsettled, many years ago, at Worthing (then a small village), where he\r\nwas a friend of Byron's Trelawny. My father visited Mr. Rich at\r\nWorthing, more than once, and gained a cordial liking and respect for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Rich died in April, 1891, having arranged that his bequest[267]\r\nshould not lapse in consequence of the predecease of my father.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 he received from the Royal Academy of Turin the _Bressa_ Prize\r\nfor the years 1875-78, amounting to the sum of 12,000 francs. He refers\r\nto this in a letter to Dr. Dohrn (February 15th, 1880):--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you saw in the papers that the Turin Society honoured me to an\r\nextraordinary degree by awarding me the _Bressa_ Prize. Now it occurred\r\nto me that if your station wanted some piece of apparatus, of about the\r\nvalue of L100, I should very much like to be allowed to pay for it. Will\r\nyou be so kind as to keep this in mind, and if any want should occur to\r\nyou, I would send you a cheque at any time.\"\r\n\r\nI find from my father's accounts that L100 was presented to the Naples\r\nStation.\r\n\r\nTwo years before my father's death, and twenty-one years after the\r\npublication of his greatest work, a lecture was given (April 9, 1880) at\r\nthe Royal Institution by Mr. Huxley[268] which was aptly named \"The\r\nComing of Age of the Origin of Species.\" The following characteristic\r\nletter, inferring to this subject, may fitly close the present chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbinger Hall, Dorking, Sunday, April 11, 1880.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HUXLEY,--I wished much to attend your Lecture, but I have had a\r\nbad cough, and we have come here to see whether a change would do me\r\ngood, as it has done. What a magnificent success your lecture seems to\r\nhave been, as I judge from the reports in the _Standard_ and _Daily\r\nNews_, and more especially from the accounts given me by three of my\r\nchildren. I suppose that you have not written out your lecture, so I\r\nfear there is no chance of its being printed _in extenso_. You appear to\r\nhave piled, as on so many other occasions, honours high and thick on my\r\nold head. But I well know how great a part you have played in\r\nestablishing and spreading the belief in the descent-theory, ever since\r\nthat grand review in the _Times_ and the battle royal at Oxford up to\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Huxley,\r\nYours sincerely and gratefully,\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--It was absurdly stupid in me, but I had read the announcement of\r\nyour Lecture, and thought that you meant the maturity of the subject,\r\nuntil my wife one day remarked, \"it is almost twenty-one years since the\r\n_Origin_ appeared,\" and then for the first time the meaning of your\r\nwords flashed on me.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[258] _The Minerva Library of famous Books_, 1890, edited by G. T.\r\nBettany.\r\n\r\n[259] The full title is _The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the\r\nAction of Worms, with Observations on their Habits_, 1881.\r\n\r\n[260] The same number contains a good biographical sketch of my father\r\nof which the material was to a large extent supplied by him to the\r\nwriter, Professor Preyer of Jena. The article contains an excellent list\r\nof my father's publications.\r\n\r\n[261] He once made an attempt to free a patient in a mad-house, who (as\r\nhe wrongly supposed) was sane. He was in correspondence with the\r\ngardener at the asylum, and on one occasion he found a letter from the\r\npatient enclosed with one from the gardener. The letter was rational in\r\ntone and declared that the writer was sane and wrongfully confined.\r\n\r\nMy father wrote to the Lunacy Commissioners (without explaining the\r\nsource of his information) and in due time heard that the man had been\r\nvisited by the Commissioners, and that he was certainly insane. Some\r\ntime afterward the patient was discharged, and wrote to thank my father\r\nfor his interference, adding that he had undoubtedly been insane when he\r\nwrote his former letter.\r\n\r\n[262] Professor of Physiology at Upsala.\r\n\r\n[263] In 1867 he had received a distinguished honour from Germany,--the\r\norder \"Pour le Merite.\"\r\n\r\n[264] \"Let us recognise Darwin's great service to Natural Science in\r\nbringing back to it Teleology; so that instead of Morphology _versus_\r\nTeleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to Teleology.\" Similar\r\nremarks had been previously made by Mr. Huxley. See _Critiques and\r\nAddresses_, p. 305.\r\n\r\n[265] A _replica_ by the artist hangs alongside of the portraits of\r\nMilton and Paley in the hall of Christ's College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[266] He received twenty-six votes out of a possible thirty-nine, five\r\nblank papers were sent in, and eight votes were recorded for the other\r\ncandidates. In 1872 an attempt had been made to elect him in the Section\r\nof Zoology, when, however, he only received fifteen out of forty-eight\r\nvotes, and Loven was chosen for the vacant place. It appears (_Nature_,\r\nAugust 1st, 1872) that an eminent member of the Academy wrote to _Les\r\nMondes_ to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n\"What has closed the doors of the Academy to Mr. Darwin is that the\r\nscience of those of his books which have made his chief title to\r\nfame--the _Origin of Species_, and still more the _Descent of Man_, is\r\nnot science, but a mass of assertions and absolutely gratuitous\r\nhypotheses, often evidently fallacious. This kind of publication and\r\nthese theories are a bad example, which a body that respects itself\r\ncannot encourage.\"\r\n\r\n[267] Mr. Rich leaves a single near relative, to whom is bequeathed the\r\nlife-interest in his property.\r\n\r\n[268] Published in _Science and Culture_, p. 310.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTANICAL WORK.\r\n\r\n     \"I have been making some little trifling observations which have\r\n     interested and perplexed me much.\"\r\n\r\n     From a letter of June 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nFERTILISATION OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe botanical work which my father accomplished by the guidance of the\r\nlight cast on the study of natural history by his own work on evolution\r\nremains to be noticed. In a letter to Mr. Murray, September 24th, 1861,\r\nspeaking of his book the _Fertilisation of Orchids_, he says: \"It will\r\nperhaps serve to illustrate how Natural History may be worked under the\r\nbelief of the modification of species.\" This remark gives a suggestion\r\nas to the value and interest of his botanical work, and it might be\r\nexpressed in far more emphatic language without danger of exaggeration.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter to Mr. Murray, he says: \"I think this little volume\r\nwill do good to the _Origin_, as it will show that I have worked hard at\r\ndetails.\" It is true that his botanical work added a mass of\r\ncorroborative detail to the case for Evolution, but the chief support\r\ngiven to his doctrines by these researches was of another kind. They\r\nsupplied an argument against those critics who have so freely dogmatised\r\nas to the uselessness of particular structures, and as to the consequent\r\nimpossibility of their having been developed by means of natural\r\nselection. His observations on Orchids enabled him to say: \"I can show\r\nthe meaning of some of the apparently meaningless ridges and horns; who\r\nwill now venture to say that this or that structure is useless?\" A\r\nkindred point is expressed in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker (May 14th,\r\n1862):--\r\n\r\n\"When many parts of structure, as in the woodpecker, show distinct\r\nadaptation to external bodies, it is preposterous to attribute them to\r\nthe effects of climate, &c., but when a single point alone, as a hooked\r\nseed, it is conceivable it may thus have arisen. I have found the study\r\nof Orchids eminently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the\r\nflower are co-adapted for fertilisation by insects, and therefore the\r\nresults of natural selection,--even the most trifling details of\r\nstructure.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest services rendered by my father to the Study of\r\nNatural History is the revival of Teleology. The evolutionist studies\r\nthe purpose or meaning of organs with the zeal of the older Teleologist,\r\nbut with far wider and more coherent purpose. He has the invigorating\r\nknowledge that he is gaining not isolated conceptions of the economy of\r\nthe present, but a coherent view of both past and present. And even\r\nwhere he fails to discover the use of any part, he may, by a knowledge\r\nof its structure, unravel the history of the past vicissitudes in the\r\nlife of the species. In this way a vigour and unity is given to the\r\nstudy of the forms of organised beings, which before it lacked. Mr.\r\nHuxley has well remarked:[269] \"Perhaps the most remarkable service to\r\nthe philosophy of Biology rendered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation\r\nof Teleology and Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both,\r\nwhich his views offer. The teleology which supposes that the eye, such\r\nas we see it in man, or one of the higher vertebrata, was made with the\r\nprecise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of enabling the animal\r\nwhich possesses it to see, has undoubtedly received its death-blow.\r\nNevertheless, it is necessary to remember that there is a wider\r\nteleology which is not touched by the doctrine of Evolution, but is\r\nactually based upon the fundamental proposition of Evolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe point which here especially concerns us is to recognise that this\r\n\"great service to natural science,\" as Dr. Gray describes it, was\r\neffected almost as much by Darwin's special botanical work as by the\r\n_Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\nFor a statement of the scope and influence of my father's botanical\r\nwork, I may refer to Mr. Thiselton Dyer's article in 'Charles Darwin,'\r\none of the _Nature Series_. Mr. Dyer's wide knowledge, his friendship\r\nwith my father, and his power of sympathising with the work of others,\r\ncombine to give this essay a permanent value. The following passage (p.\r\n43) gives a true picture:--\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the extent and variety of his botanical work, Mr.\r\nDarwin always disclaimed any right to be regarded as a professed\r\nbotanist. He turned his attention to plants, doubtless because they were\r\nconvenient objects for studying organic phenomena in their least\r\ncomplicated forms; and this point of view, which, if one may use the\r\nexpression without disrespect, had something of the amateur about it,\r\nwas in itself of the greatest importance. For, from not being, till he\r\ntook up any point, familiar with the literature bearing on it, his mind\r\nwas absolutely free from any prepossession. He was never afraid of his\r\nfacts, or of framing any hypothesis, however startling, which seemed to\r\nexplain them.... In any one else such an attitude would have produced\r\nmuch work that was crude and rash. But Mr. Darwin--if one may venture on\r\nlanguage which will strike no one who had conversed with him as\r\nover-strained--seemed by gentle persuasion to have penetrated that\r\nreserve of nature which baffles smaller men. In other words, his long\r\nexperience had given him a kind of instinctive insight into the method\r\nof attack of any biological problem, however unfamiliar to him, while he\r\nrigidly controlled the fertility of his mind in hypothetical\r\nexplanations by the no less fertility of ingeniously devised\r\nexperiment.\"\r\n\r\nTo form any just idea of the greatness of the revolution worked by my\r\nfather's researches in the study of the fertilisation of flowers, it is\r\nnecessary to know from what a condition this branch of knowledge has\r\nemerged. It should be remembered that it was only during the early years\r\nof the present century that the idea of sex, as applied to plants,\r\nbecame firmly established. Sachs, in his _History of Botany_[270]\r\n(1875), has given some striking illustrations of the remarkable slowness\r\nwith which its acceptance gained ground. He remarks that when we\r\nconsider the experimental proofs given by Camerarius (1694), and by\r\nKoelreuter (1761-66), it appears incredible that doubts should afterwards\r\nhave been raised as to the sexuality of plants. Yet he shows that such\r\ndoubts did actually repeatedly crop up. These adverse criticisms rested\r\nfor the most part on careless experiments, but in many cases on _a\r\npriori_ arguments. Even as late as 1820, a book of this kind, which\r\nwould now rank with circle squaring, or flat-earth philosophy, was\r\nseriously noticed in a botanical journal. A distinct conception of sex,\r\nas applied to plants, had, in fact, not long emerged from the mists of\r\nprofitless discussion and feeble experiment, at the time when my father\r\nbegan botany by attending Henslow's lectures at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nWhen the belief in the sexuality of plants had become established as an\r\nincontrovertible piece of knowledge, a weight of misconception remained,\r\nweighing down any rational view of the subject. Camerarius[271] believed\r\n(naturally enough in his day) that hermaphrodite[272] flowers are\r\nnecessarily self-fertilised. He had the wit to be astonished at this, a\r\ndegree of intelligence which, as Sachs points out, the majority of his\r\nsuccessors did not attain to.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from a note-book show that this point occurred\r\nto my father as early as 1837:\r\n\r\n\"Do not plants which have male and female organs together [_i.e._ in the\r\nsame flower] yet receive influence from other plants? Does not Lyell\r\ngive some argument about varieties being difficult to keep [true] on\r\naccount of pollen from other plants? Because this may be applied to show\r\nall plants do receive intermixture.\"\r\n\r\nSprengel,[273] indeed, understood that the hermaphrodite structure of\r\nflowers by no means necessarily leads to self-fertilisation. But\r\nalthough he discovered that in many cases pollen is of necessity carried\r\nto the stigma of another _flower_, he did not understand that in the\r\nadvantage gained by the intercrossing of distinct _plants_ lies the key\r\nto the whole question. Hermann Mueller[274] has well remarked that this\r\n\"omission was for several generations fatal to Sprengel's work.... For\r\nboth at the time and subsequently, botanists felt above all the weakness\r\nof his theory, and they set aside, along with his defective ideas, the\r\nrich store of his patient and acute observations and his comprehensive\r\nand accurate interpretations.\" It remained for my father to convince the\r\nworld that the meaning hidden in the structure of flowers was to be\r\nfound by seeking light in the same direction in which Sprengel, seventy\r\nyears before, had laboured. Robert Brown was the connecting link between\r\nthem, for it was at his recommendation that my father in 1841 read\r\nSprengel's now celebrated _Secret of Nature Displayed_.[275]\r\n\r\nThe book impressed him as being \"full of truth,\" although \"with some\r\nlittle nonsense.\" It not only encouraged him in kindred speculation, but\r\nguided him in his work, for in 1844 he speaks of verifying Sprengel's\r\nobservations. It may be doubted whether Robert Brown ever planted a more\r\nfruitful seed than in putting such a book into such hands.\r\n\r\nA passage in the _Autobiography_ (p. 44) shows how it was that my father\r\nwas attracted to the subject of fertilisation: \"During the summer of\r\n1839, and I believe during the previous summer, I was led to attend to\r\nthe cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from having\r\ncome to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species, that\r\ncrossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant.\"\r\n\r\nThe original connection between the study of flowers and the problem of\r\nevolution is curious, and could hardly have been predicted. Moreover, it\r\nwas not a permanent bond. My father proved by a long series of laborious\r\nexperiments, that when a plant is fertilised and sets seeds under the\r\ninfluence of pollen from a distinct individual, the offspring so\r\nproduced are superior in vigour to the offspring of self-fertilisation,\r\n_i.e._ of the union of the male and female elements of a single plant.\r\nWhen this fact was established, it was possible to understand the\r\n_raison d'etre_ of the machinery which insures cross-fertilisation in so\r\nmany flowers; and to understand how natural selection can act on, and\r\nmould, the floral structure.\r\n\r\nAsa Gray has well remarked with regard to this central idea (_Nature_,\r\nJune 4, 1874):--\"The aphorism, 'Nature abhors a vacuum,' is a\r\ncharacteristic specimen of the science of the middle ages. The aphorism,\r\n'Nature abhors close fertilisation,' and the demonstration of the\r\nprinciple, belong to our age and to Mr. Darwin. To have originated this,\r\nand also the principle of Natural Selection ... and to have applied\r\nthese principles to the system of nature, in such a manner as to make,\r\nwithin a dozen years, a deeper impression upon natural history than has\r\nbeen made since Linnaeus, is ample title for one man's fame.\"\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the Papilionaceae[276] attracted his attention early, and\r\nwere the subject of his first paper on fertilisation.[277] The following\r\nextract from an undated letter to Asa Gray seems to have been written\r\nbefore the publication of this paper, probably in 1856 or 1857:--\r\n\r\n\" ... What you say on Papilionaceous flowers is very true; and I have no\r\nfacts to show that varieties are crossed; but yet (and the same remark\r\nis applicable in a beautiful way to Fumaria and Dielytra, as I noticed\r\nmany years ago), I must believe that the flowers are constructed partly\r\nin direct relation to the visits of insects; and how insects can avoid\r\nbringing pollen from other individuals I cannot understand. It is really\r\npretty to watch the action of a humble-bee on the scarlet kidney bean,\r\nand in this genus (and in _Lathyrus grandiflorus_)[278] the honey is so\r\nplaced that the bee invariably alights on that _one_ side of the flower\r\ntowards which the spiral pistil is protruded (bringing out with it\r\npollen), and by the depression of the wing-petal is forced against the\r\nbee's side all dusted with pollen. In the broom the pistil is rubbed on\r\nthe centre of the back of the bee. I suspect there is something to be\r\nmade out about the Leguminosae, which will bring the case within _our_\r\ntheory; though I have failed to do so. Our theory will explain why in\r\nthe vegetable ... kingdom the act of fertilisation even in\r\nhermaphrodites usually takes place _sub jove_, though thus exposed to\r\n_great_ injury from damp and rain.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to Dr. Asa Gray (September 5th, 1857) gives the substance of\r\nthe paper in the _Gardeners' Chronicle_:--\r\n\r\n\"Lately I was led to examine buds of kidney bean with the pollen shed;\r\nbut I was led to believe that the pollen could _hardly_ get on the\r\nstigma by wind or otherwise, except by bees visiting [the flower] and\r\nmoving the wing petals: hence I included a small bunch of flowers in two\r\nbottles in every way treated the same: the flowers in one I daily just\r\nmomentarily moved, as if by a bee; these set three fine pods, the other\r\n_not one_. Of course this little experiment must be tried again, and\r\nthis year in England it is too late, as the flowers seem now seldom to\r\nset. If bees are necessary to this flower's self-fertilisation, bees\r\nmust almost cross them, as their dusted right-side of head and right\r\nlegs constantly touch the stigma.\r\n\r\n\"I have, also, lately been reobserving daily _Lobelia fulgens_--this in\r\nmy garden is never visited by insects, and never sets seeds, without\r\npollen be put on the stigma (whereas the small blue Lobelia is visited\r\nby bees and does set seed); I mention this because there are such\r\nbeautiful contrivances to prevent the stigma ever getting its own\r\npollen; which seems only explicable on the doctrine of the advantage of\r\ncrosses.\"\r\n\r\nThe paper was supplemented by a second in 1858.[279] The chief object of\r\nthese publications seems to have been to obtain information as to the\r\npossibility of growing varieties of Leguminous plants near each other,\r\nand yet keeping them true. It is curious that the Papilionaceae should\r\nnot only have been the first flowers which attracted his attention by\r\ntheir obvious adaptation to the visits of insects, but should also have\r\nconstituted one of his sorest puzzles. The common pea and the sweet pea\r\ngave him much difficulty, because, although they are as obviously fitted\r\nfor insect-visits as the rest of the order, yet their varieties keep\r\ntrue. The fact is that neither of these plants being indigenous, they\r\nare not perfectly adapted for fertilisation by British insects. He could\r\nnot, at this stage of his observations, know that the co-ordination\r\nbetween a flower and the particular insect which fertilises it may be\r\nas delicate as that between a lock and its key, so that this explanation\r\nwas not likely to occur to him.\r\n\r\nBesides observing the Leguminosae, he had already begun, as shown in the\r\nforegoing extracts, to attend to the structure of other flowers in\r\nrelation to insects. At the beginning of 1860 he worked at\r\nLeschenaultia,[280] which at first puzzled him, but was ultimately made\r\nout. A passage in a letter chiefly relating to Leschenaultia seems to\r\nshow that it was only in the spring of 1860 that he began widely to\r\napply his knowledge to the relation of insects to other flowers. This is\r\nsomewhat surprising, when we remember that he had read Sprengel many\r\nyears before. He wrote (May 14):--\r\n\r\n\"I should look at this curious contrivance as specially related to\r\nvisits of insects; as I begin to think is almost universally the case.\"\r\n\r\nEven in July 1862 he wrote to Asa Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"There is no end to the adaptations. Ought not these cases to make one\r\nvery cautious when one doubts about the use of all parts? I fully\r\nbelieve that the structure of all irregular flowers is governed in\r\nrelation to insects. Insects are the Lords of the floral (to quote the\r\nwitty _Athenaeum_) world.\"\r\n\r\nThis idea has been worked out by H. Mueller, who has written on insects\r\nin the character of flower-breeders or flower-fanciers, showing how the\r\nhabits and structure of the visitors are reflected in the forms and\r\ncolours of the flowers visited.\r\n\r\nHe was probably attracted to the study of Orchids by the fact that\r\nseveral kinds are common near Down. The letters of 1860 show that these\r\nplants occupied a good deal of his attention; and in 1861 he gave part\r\nof the summer and all the autumn to the subject. He evidently considered\r\nhimself idle for wasting time on Orchids which ought to have been given\r\nto _Variation under Domestication_. Thus he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"There is to me incomparably more interest in observing than in writing;\r\nbut I feel quite guilty in trespassing on these subjects, and not\r\nsticking to varieties of the confounded cocks, hens and ducks. I hear\r\nthat Lyell is savage at me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1860 that he made out one of the most striking\r\nand familiar facts in the Orchid-book, namely, the manner in which the\r\npollen masses are adapted for removal by insects. He wrote to Sir J. D.\r\nHooker, July 12:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been examining _Orchis pyramidalis_, and it almost equals,\r\nperhaps even beats, your Listera case; the sticky glands are\r\ncongenitally united into a saddle-shaped organ, which has great power of\r\nmovement, and seizes hold of a bristle (or proboscis) in an admirable\r\nmanner, and then another movement takes place in the pollen masses, by\r\nwhich they are beautifully adapted to leave pollen on the two lateral\r\nstigmatic surfaces. I never saw anything so beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nIn June of the same year he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"You speak of adaptation being rarely visible, though present in plants.\r\nI have just recently been looking at the common Orchis, and I declare I\r\nthink its adaptations in every part of the flower quite as beautiful and\r\nplain, or even more beautiful than in the woodpecker.\"[281]\r\n\r\nHe wrote also to Dr. Gray, June 8, 1860:--\r\n\r\n\"Talking of adaptation, I have lately been looking at our common\r\norchids, and I dare say the facts are as old and well-known as the\r\nhills, but I have been so struck with admiration at the contrivances,\r\nthat I have sent a notice to the _Gardeners' Chronicle_.\"\r\n\r\nBesides attending to the fertilisation of the flowers he was already, in\r\n1860, busy with the homologies of the parts, a subject of which he made\r\ngood use in the Orchid book. He wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (July):--\r\n\r\n\"It is a real good joke my discussing homologies of Orchids with you,\r\nafter examining only three or four genera; and this very fact makes me\r\nfeel positive I am right! I do not quite understand some of your terms;\r\nbut sometime I must get you to explain the homologies; for I am\r\nintensely interested in the subject, just as at a game of chess.\"\r\n\r\nThis work was valuable from a systematic point of view. In 1880 he wrote\r\nto Mr. Bentham:--\r\n\r\n\"It was very kind in you to write to me about the Orchideae, for it has\r\npleased me to an extreme degree that I could have been of the _least_\r\nuse to you about the nature of the parts.\"\r\n\r\nThe pleasure which his early observations on Orchids gave him is shown\r\nin such passages as the following from a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker\r\n(July 27, 1861):--\r\n\r\n\"You cannot conceive how the Orchids have delighted me. They came safe,\r\nbut box rather smashed; cylindrical old cocoa-or snuff-canister much\r\nsafer. I enclose postage. As an account of the movement, I shall allude\r\nto what I suppose is Oncidium, to make _certain_,--is the enclosed\r\nflower with crumpled petals this genus? Also I most specially want to\r\nknow what the enclosed little globular brown Orchid is. I have only\r\nseen pollen of a Cattleya on a bee, but surely have you not\r\nunintentionally sent me what I wanted most (after Catasetum or\r\nMormodes), viz., one of the Epidendreae?! I _particularly_ want (and will\r\npresently tell you why) another spike of this little Orchid, with older\r\nflowers, some even almost withered.\"\r\n\r\nHis delight in observation is again shown in a letter to Dr. Gray\r\n(1863). Referring to Crueger's letters from Trinidad, he wrote:--\"Happy\r\nman, he has actually seen crowds of bees flying round Catasetum, with\r\nthe pollinia sticking to their backs!\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts of letters to Sir J. D. Hooker illustrate further\r\nthe interest which his work excited in him:--\r\n\r\n\"Veitch sent me a grand lot this morning. What wonderful structures!\r\n\r\n\"I have now seen enough, and you must not send me more, for though I\r\nenjoy looking at them _much_, and it has been very useful to me, seeing\r\nso many different forms, it is idleness. For my object each species\r\nrequires studying for days. I wish you had time to take up the group. I\r\nwould give a good deal to know what the rostellum is, of which I have\r\ntraced so many curious modifications. I suppose it cannot be one of the\r\nstigmas,[282] there seems a great tendency for two lateral stigmas to\r\nappear. My paper, though touching on only subordinate points will run, I\r\nfear, to 100 MS. folio pages! The beauty of the adaptation of parts\r\nseems to me unparalleled. I should think or guess waxy pollen was most\r\ndifferentiated. In Cypripedium which seems least modified, and a much\r\nexterminated group, the grains are single. In _all others_, as far as I\r\nhave seen, they are in packets of four; and these packets cohere into\r\nmany wedge-formed masses in Orchis; into eight, four, and finally two.\r\nIt seems curious that a flower should exist, which could _at most_\r\nfertilise only two other flowers, seeing how abundant pollen generally\r\nis; this fact I look at as explaining the perfection of the contrivance\r\nby which the pollen, so important from its fewness, is carried from\r\nflower to flower\"[283](1861).\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of writing to you to-day, when your note with the\r\nOrchids came. What frightful trouble you have taken about Vanilla; you\r\nreally must not take an atom more; for the Orchids are more play than\r\nreal work. I have been much interested by Epidendrum, and have worked\r\nall morning at them; for Heaven's sake, do not corrupt me by any more\"\r\n(August 30, 1861).\r\n\r\nHe originally intended to publish his notes on Orchids as a paper in the\r\nLinnean Society's _Journal_, but it soon became evident that a separate\r\nvolume would be a more suitable form of publication. In a letter to Sir\r\nJ. D. Hooker, Sept. 24, 1861, he writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been acting, I fear that you will think, like a goose; and\r\nperhaps in truth I have. When I finished a few days ago my Orchis paper,\r\nwhich turns out one hundred and forty folio pages!! and thought of the\r\nexpense of woodcuts, I said to myself, I will offer the Linnean Society\r\nto withdraw it, and publish it in a pamphlet. It then flashed on me that\r\nperhaps Murray would publish it, so I gave him a cautious description,\r\nand offered to share risks and profits. This morning he writes that he\r\nwill publish and take all risks, and share profits and pay for all\r\nillustrations. It is a risk, and Heaven knows whether it will not be a\r\ndead failure, but I have not deceived Murray, and [have] told him that\r\nit would interest those alone who cared much for natural history. I hope\r\nI do not exaggerate the curiosity of the many special contrivances.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again on September 28th:--\r\n\r\n\"What a good soul you are not to sneer at me, but to pat me on the back.\r\nI have the greatest doubt whether I am not going to do, in publishing my\r\npaper, a most ridiculous thing. It would annoy me much, but only for\r\nMurray's sake, if the publication were a dead failure.\"\r\n\r\nThere was still much work to be done, and in October he was still\r\nreceiving Orchids from Kew, and wrote to Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to thank you enough. I was almost mad at the wealth of\r\nOrchids.\" And again--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Veitch most generously has sent me two splendid buds of Mormodes,\r\nwhich will be capital for dissection, but I fear will never be\r\nirritable; so for the sake of charity and love of heaven do, I beseech\r\nyou, observe what movement takes place in Cychnoches, and what part must\r\nbe touched. Mr. V. has also sent me one splendid flower of Catasetum,\r\nthe most wonderful Orchid I have seen.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 13 he wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"It seems that I cannot exhaust your good nature. I have had the hardest\r\nday's work at Catasetum and buds of Mormodes, and believe I understand\r\nat last the mechanism of movements and the functions. Catasetum is a\r\nbeautiful case of slight modification of structure leading to new\r\nfunctions. I never was more interested in any subject in all my life\r\nthan in this of Orchids. I owe very much to you.\"\r\n\r\nAgain to the same friend, November 1, 1861:--\r\n\r\n\"If you really can spare another Catasetum, when nearly ready, I shall\r\nbe most grateful; had I not better send for it? The case is truly\r\nmarvellous; the (so-called) sensation, or stimulus from a light touch is\r\ncertainly transmitted through the antennae for more than one inch\r\n_instantaneously_.... A cursed insect or something let my last flower\r\noff last night.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor de Candolle has remarked[284] of my father, \"Ce n'est pas lui\r\nqui aurait demande de construire des palais pour y loger des\r\nlaboratoires.\" This was singularly true of his orchid work, or rather it\r\nwould be nearer the truth to say that he had no laboratory, for it was\r\nonly after the publication of the _Fertilisation of Orchids_, that he\r\nbuilt himself a greenhouse. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (December 24th,\r\n1862):--\r\n\r\n\"And now I am going to tell you a _most_ important piece of news!! I\r\nhave almost resolved to build a small hot-house; my neighbour's really\r\nfirst-rate gardener has suggested it, and offered to make me plans, and\r\nsee that it is well done, and he is really a clever follow, who wins\r\nlots of prizes, and is very observant. He believes that we should\r\nsucceed with a little patience; it will be a grand amusement for me to\r\nexperiment with plants.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote (February 15th, 1863):--\r\n\r\n\"I write now because the new hot-house is ready, and I long to stock it,\r\njust like a schoolboy. Could you tell me pretty soon what plants you can\r\ngive me; and then I shall know what to order? And do advise me how I had\r\nbetter get such plants as you can _spare_. Would it do to send my\r\ntax-cart early in the morning, on a day that was not frosty, lining the\r\ncart with mats, and arriving here before night? I have no idea whether\r\nthis degree of exposure (and of course the cart would be cold) could\r\ninjure stove-plants; they would be about five hours (with bait) on the\r\njourney home.\"\r\n\r\nA week later he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"You cannot imagine what pleasure your plants give me (far more than\r\nyour dead Wedgwood-ware can give you); H. and I go and gloat over them,\r\nbut we privately confessed to each other, that if they were not our own,\r\nperhaps we should not see such transcendant beauty in each leaf.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in March, when he was extremely unwell, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"A few words about the stove-plants; they do so amuse me. I have crawled\r\nto see them two or three times. Will you correct and answer, and return\r\nenclosed. I have hunted in all my books and cannot find these names, and\r\nI like much to know the family.\" His difficulty with regard to the names\r\nof plants is illustrated, with regard to a Lupine on which he was at\r\nwork, in an extract from a letter (July 21, 1866) to Sir J. D. Hooker:\r\n\"I sent to the nursery garden, whence I bought the seed, and could only\r\nhear that it was 'the common blue Lupine,' the man saying 'he was no\r\nscholard, and did not know Latin, and that parties who make experiments\r\nought to find out the names.'\"\r\n\r\nThe book was published May 15th, 1862. Of its reception he writes to Mr.\r\nMurray, June 13th and 18th:--\r\n\r\n\"The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies. Some one sent me\r\n(perhaps you) the _Parthenon_, with a good review. The _Athenaeum_[285]\r\ntreats me with very kind pity and contempt; but the reviewer knew\r\nnothing of his subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a superb, but I fear exaggerated, review in the _London\r\nReview_.[286] But I have not been a fool, as I thought I was, to\r\npublish; for Asa Gray, about the most competent judge in the world,\r\nthinks almost as highly of the book as does the _London Review_. The\r\n_Athenaeum_ will hinder the sale greatly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. M. J. Berkeley was the author of the notice in the _London\r\nReview_, as my father learned from Sir J. D. Hooker, who added, \"I\r\nthought it very well done indeed. I have read a good deal of the\r\nOrchid-book, and echo all he says.\"\r\n\r\nTo this my father replied (June 30th, 1862):--\r\n\r\n\"My dear old friend,--You speak of my warming the cockles of your heart,\r\nbut you will never know how often you have warmed mine. It is not your\r\napprobation of my scientific work (though I care for that more than for\r\nany one's): it is something deeper. To this day I remember keenly a\r\nletter you wrote to me from Oxford, when I was at the Water-cure, and\r\nhow it cheered me when I was utterly weary of life. Well, my Orchid-book\r\nis a success (but I do not know whether it sells).\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter to the same friend, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"You have pleased me much by what you say in regard to Bentham and\r\nOliver approving of my book; for I had got a sort of nervousness, and\r\ndoubted whether I had not made an egregious fool of myself, and\r\nconcocted pleasant little stinging remarks for reviews, such as 'Mr.\r\nDarwin's head seems to have been turned by a certain degree of success,\r\nand he thinks that the most trifling observations are worth\r\npublication.'\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote too, to Asa Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"Your generous sympathy makes you over-estimate what you have read of my\r\nOrchid-book. But your letter of May 18th and 26th has given me an almost\r\nfoolish amount of satisfaction. The subject interested me, I knew,\r\nbeyond its real value; but I had lately got to think that I had made\r\nmyself a complete fool by publishing in a semi-popular form. Now I shall\r\nconfidently defy the world.... No doubt my volume contains much error:\r\nhow curiously difficult it is to be accurate, though I try my utmost.\r\nYour notes have interested me beyond measure. I can now afford to d----\r\nmy critics with ineffable complacency of mind. Cordial thanks for this\r\nbenefit.\"\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker reviewed the book in the _Gardeners' Chronicle_,\r\nwriting in a successful imitation of the style of Lindley, the Editor.\r\nMy father wrote to Sir Joseph (Nov. 12, 1862):--\r\n\r\n\"So you did write the review in the _Gardeners' Chronicle_. Once or\r\ntwice I doubted whether it was Lindley; but when I came to a little slap\r\nat R. Brown, I doubted no longer. You arch-rogue! I do not wonder you\r\nhave deceived others also. Perhaps I am a conceited dog; but if so, you\r\nhave much to answer for; I never received so much praise, and coming\r\nfrom you I value it much more than from any other.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to botanical opinion generally, he wrote to Dr. Gray, \"I am\r\nfairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists.\" Among\r\nnaturalists who were not botanists, Lyell was pre-eminent in his\r\nappreciation of the book. I have no means of knowing when he read it,\r\nbut in later life, as I learn from Professor Judd, he was enthusiastic\r\nin praise of the _Fertilisation of Orchids_, which he considered \"next\r\nto the _Origin_, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works.\" Among the\r\ngeneral public the author did not at first hear of many disciples, thus\r\nhe wrote to his cousin Fox in September 1862: \"Hardly any one not a\r\nbotanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it.\"\r\n\r\nIf we examine the literature relating to the fertilisation of flowers,\r\nwe do not find that this new branch of study showed any great activity\r\nimmediately after the publication of the Orchid-book. There are a few\r\npapers by Asa Gray, in 1862 and 1863, by Hildebrand in 1864, and by\r\nMoggridge in 1865, but the great mass of work by Axell, Delpino,\r\nHildebrand, and the Muellers, did not begin to appear until about 1867.\r\nThe period during which the new views were being assimilated, and before\r\nthey became thoroughly fruitful, was, however, surprisingly short. The\r\nlater activity in this department may be roughly gauged by the fact that\r\nthe valuable 'Bibliography,' given by Professor D'Arcy Thompson in his\r\ntranslation of Mueller's _Befruchtung_ (1883),[287] contains references\r\nto 814 papers.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 a second edition of the _Fertilisation of Orchids_ was\r\npublished, the first edition having been for some time out of print. The\r\nnew edition was remodelled and almost rewritten, and a large amount of\r\nnew matter added, much of which the author owed to his friend Fritz\r\nMueller.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this edition he wrote to Dr. Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose I shall ever again touch the book. After much doubt I\r\nhave resolved to act in this way with all my books for the future; that\r\nis to correct them once and never touch them again, so as to use the\r\nsmall quantity of work left in me for new matter.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the latest references to his Orchid-work occurs in a letter to\r\nMr. Bentham, February 16, 1880. It shows the amount of pleasure which\r\nthis subject gave to my father, and (what is characteristic of him) that\r\nhis reminiscence of the work was one of delight in the observations\r\nwhich preceded its publication, not to the applause which followed it:--\r\n\r\n\"They are wonderful creatures, these Orchids, and I sometimes think with\r\na glow of pleasure, when I remember making out some little point in\r\ntheir method of fertilisation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Effect of Cross-and Self-fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom.\r\nDifferent Forms of Flowers on Plants of the same species._\r\n\r\nTwo other books bearing on the problem of sex in plants require a brief\r\nnotice. _The Effects of Cross- and Self-Fertilisation_, published in\r\n1876, is one of his most important works, and at the same time one of\r\nthe most unreadable to any but the professed naturalist. Its value lies\r\nin the proof it offers of the increased vigour given to the offspring by\r\nthe act of cross-fertilisation. It is the complement of the Orchid book\r\nbecause it makes us understand the advantage gained by the mechanisms\r\nfor insuring cross-fertilisation described in that work.\r\n\r\nThe book is also valuable in another respect, because it throws light on\r\nthe difficult problems of the origin of sexuality. The increased vigour\r\nresulting from cross-fertilisation is allied in the closest manner to\r\nthe advantage gained by change of conditions. So strongly is this the\r\ncase, that in some instances cross-fertilisation gives no advantage to\r\nthe offspring, unless the parents have lived under slightly different\r\nconditions. So that the really important thing is not that two\r\nindividuals of different _blood_ shall unite, but two individuals which\r\nhave been subjected to different conditions. We are thus led to believe\r\nthat sexuality is a means for infusing vigour into the offspring by the\r\ncoalescence of differentiated elements, an advantage which could not\r\naccompany asexual reproductions.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that this book, the result of eleven years of\r\nexperimental work, owed its origin to a chance observation. My father\r\nhad raised two beds of _Linaria vulgaris_--one set being the offspring\r\nof cross and the other of self-fertilisation. The plants were grown for\r\nthe sake of some observations on inheritance, and not with any view to\r\ncross-breeding, and he was astonished to observe that the offspring of\r\nself-fertilisation were clearly less vigorous than the others. It seemed\r\nincredible to him that this result could be due to a single act of\r\nself-fertilisation, and it was only in the following year, when\r\nprecisely the same result occurred in the case of a similar experiment\r\non inheritance in carnations, that his attention was \"thoroughly\r\naroused,\" and that he determined to make a series of experiments\r\nspecially directed to the question.\r\n\r\nThe volume on _Forms of Flowers_ was published in 1877, and was\r\ndedicated by the author to Professor Asa Gray, \"as a small tribute of\r\nrespect and affection.\" It consists of certain earlier papers re-edited,\r\nwith the addition of a quantity of new matter. The subjects treated in\r\nthe book are:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     (i.) Heterostyled Plants.\r\n\r\n     (ii.) Polygamous, Dioecious, and Gynodioecious Plants.\r\n\r\n     (iii.) Cleistogamic Flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of heterostyled plants may be illustrated in the primrose,\r\none of the best known examples of the class. If a number of primroses be\r\ngathered, it will be found that some plants yield nothing but \"pin-eyed\"\r\nflowers, in which the style (or organ for the transmission of the pollen\r\nto the ovule) is long, while the others yield only \"thrum-eyed\" flowers\r\nwith short styles. Thus primroses are divided into two sets or castes\r\ndiffering structurally from each other. My father showed that they also\r\ndiffer sexually, and that in fact the bond between the two castes more\r\nnearly resembles that between separate sexes than any other known\r\nrelationship. Thus for example a long-styled primrose, though it can be\r\nfertilised by its own pollen, is not _fully_ fertile unless it is\r\nimpregnated by the pollen of a short-styled flower. Heterostyled plants\r\nare comparable to hermaphrodite animals, such as snails, which require\r\nthe concourse of two individuals, although each possesses both the\r\nsexual elements. The difference is that in the case of the primrose it\r\nis _perfect fertility_, and not simply _fertility_, that depends on the\r\nmutual action of the two sets of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe work on heterostyled plants has a special bearing, to which the\r\nauthor attached much importance, on the problem of the origin of\r\nspecies.[288]\r\n\r\nHe found that a wonderfully close parallelism exists between\r\nhybridisation (_i.e._ crosses between distinct species), and certain\r\nforms of fertilisation among heterostyled plants. So that it is hardly\r\nan exaggeration to say that the \"illegitimately\" reared seedlings are\r\nhybrids, although both their parents belong to identically the same\r\nspecies. In a letter to Professor Huxley, given in the second volume of\r\nthe _Life and Letters_ (p. 384), my father writes as if his researches\r\non heterostyled plants tended to make him believe that sterility is a\r\nselected or acquired quality. But in his later publications, _e.g._ in\r\nthe sixth edition of the _Origin_, he adheres to the belief that\r\nsterility is an incidental[289] rather than a selected quality. The\r\nresult of his work on heterostyled plants is of importance as showing\r\nthat sterility is no test of specific distinctness, and that it depends\r\non differentiation of the sexual elements which is independent of any\r\nracial difference. I imagine that it was his instinctive love of making\r\nout a difficulty which to a great extent kept him at work so patiently\r\non the heterostyled plants. But it was the fact that general conclusions\r\nof the above character could be drawn from his results which made him\r\nthink his results worthy of publication.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[269] The \"Genealogy of Animals\" (_The Academy_, 1869), reprinted in\r\n_Critiques and Addresses_.\r\n\r\n[270] An English edition is published by the Clarendon Press, 1890.\r\n\r\n[271] Sachs, _Geschichte d.

D. Hooker\r\nfor information as to previous publications on the subject, being then\r\nin ignorance of Palm's and H. v. Mohl's works on climbing plants, both\r\nof which were published in 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. Darwin to Asa Gray._ Down, August 4 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy present hobby-horse I owe to you, viz. the tendrils: their\r\nirritability is beautiful, as beautiful in all its modifications as\r\nanything in Orchids. About the _spontaneous_ movement (independent of\r\ntouch) of the tendrils and upper internodes, I am rather taken aback by\r\nyour saying, \"is it not well known?\" I can find nothing in any book\r\nwhich I have.... The spontaneous movement of the tendrils is independent\r\nof the movement of the upper internodes, but both work harmoniously\r\ntogether in sweeping a circle for the tendrils to grasp a stick. So with\r\nall climbing plants (without tendrils) as yet examined, the upper\r\ninternodes go on night and day sweeping a circle in one fixed direction.\r\nIt is surprising to watch the Apocyneae with shoots 18 inches long\r\n(beyond the supporting stick), steadily searching for something to climb\r\nup. When the shoot meets a stick, the motion at that point is arrested,\r\nbut in the upper part is continued; so that the climbing of all plants\r\nyet examined is the simple result of the spontaneous circulatory\r\nmovement of the upper internodes.[291] Pray tell me whether anything has\r\nbeen published on this subject? I hate publishing what is old; but I\r\nshall hardly regret my work if it is old, as it has much amused me....\r\n\r\n\r\nHe soon found that his observations were not entirely novel, and wrote\r\nto Hooker: \"I have now read two German books, and all I believe that has\r\nbeen written on climbers, and it has stirred me up to find that I have a\r\ngood deal of new matter. It is strange, but I really think no one has\r\nexplained simple twining plants. These books have stirred me up, and\r\nmade me wish for plants specified in them.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued his observations on climbing plants during the prolonged\r\nillness from which he suffered in the autumn of 1863, and in the\r\nfollowing spring. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker, apparently in March\r\n1864:--\r\n\r\n\"The hot-house is such an amusement to me, and my amusement I owe to\r\nyou, as my delight is to look at the many odd leaves and plants from\r\nKew.... The only approach to work which I can do is to look at tendrils\r\nand climbers, this does not distress my weakened brain. Ask Oliver to\r\nlook over the enclosed queries (and do you look) and amuse a broken-down\r\nbrother naturalist by answering any which he can. If you ever lounge\r\nthrough your houses, remember me and climbing plants.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to Dr. Gray, April 9, 1865, has a word or two on the subject.--\r\n\r\n\"I have began correcting proofs of my paper on Climbing Plants. I\r\nsuppose I shall be able to send you a copy in four or five weeks. I\r\nthink it contains a good deal new, and some curious points, but it is so\r\nfearfully long, that no one will ever read it. If, however, you do not\r\n_skim_ through it, you will be an unnatural parent, for it is your\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gray not only read it but approved of it, to my father's great\r\nsatisfaction, as the following extracts show:--\r\n\r\n\"I was much pleased to get your letter of July 24th. Now that I can do\r\nnothing, I maunder over old subjects, and your approbation of my\r\nclimbing paper gives me _very_ great satisfaction. I made my\r\nobservations when I could do nothing else and much enjoyed it, but\r\nalways doubted whether they were worth publishing....\r\n\r\n\"I received yesterday your article[292] on climbers, and it has pleased\r\nme in an extraordinary and even silly manner. You pay me a superb\r\ncompliment, and as I have just said to my wife, I think my friends must\r\nperceive that I like praise, they give me such hearty doses. I always\r\nadmire your skill in reviews or abstracts, and you have done this\r\narticle excellently and given the whole essence of my paper.... I have\r\nhad a letter from a good zoologist in S. Brazil, F. Mueller, who has been\r\nstirred up to observe climbers, and gives me some curious cases of\r\n_branch_-climbers, in which branches are converted into tendrils, and\r\nthen continue to grow and throw out leaves and new branches, and then\r\nlose their tendril character.\"\r\n\r\nThe paper on Climbing Plants was republished in 1875, as a separate\r\nbook. The author had been unable to give his customary amount of care to\r\nthe style of the original essay, owing to the fact that it was written\r\nduring a period of continued ill-health, and it was now found to require\r\na great deal of alteration. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (March 3,\r\n1875): \"It is lucky for authors in general that they do not require such\r\ndreadful work in merely licking what they write into shape.\" And to Mr.\r\nMurray, in September, he wrote: \"The corrections are heavy in _Climbing\r\nPlants_, and yet I deliberately went over the MS. and old sheets three\r\ntimes.\" The book was published in September 1875, an edition of 1500\r\ncopies was struck off; the edition sold fairly well, and 500 additional\r\ncopies were printed in June of the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Power of Movement in Plants._ 1880.\r\n\r\nThe few sentences in the autobiographical chapter give with sufficient\r\nclearness the connection between the _Power of Movement_ and the book on\r\nClimbing Plants. The central idea of the book is that the movements of\r\nplants in relation to light, gravitation, &c., are modifications of a\r\nspontaneous tendency to revolve or circumnutate, which is widely\r\ninherent in the growing parts of plants. This conception has not been\r\ngenerally adopted, and has not taken a place among the canons of\r\northodox physiology. The book has been treated by Professor Sachs with a\r\nfew words of professorial contempt; and by Professor Wiesner it has been\r\nhonoured by careful and generously expressed criticism.\r\n\r\nMr. Thiselton Dyer[293] has well said: \"Whether this masterly\r\nconception of the unity of what has hitherto seemed a chaos of unrelated\r\nphenomena will be sustained, time alone will show. But no one can doubt\r\nthe importance of what Mr. Darwin has done, in showing that for the\r\nfuture the phenomena of plant movement can and indeed must be studied\r\nfrom a single point of view.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was begun in the summer of 1877, after the publication of\r\n_Different Forms of Flowers_, and by the autumn his enthusiasm for the\r\nsubject was thoroughly established, and he wrote to Mr. Dyer: \"I am all\r\non fire at the work.\" At this time he was studying the movements of\r\ncotyledons, in which the sleep of plants is to be observed in its\r\nsimplest form; in the following spring he was trying to discover what\r\nuseful purpose those sleep-movements could serve, and wrote to Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker (March 25th, 1878):--\r\n\r\n\"I think we have _proved_ that the sleep of plants is to lessen the\r\ninjury to the leaves from radiation. This has interested me much, and\r\nhas cost us great labour, as it has been a problem since the time of\r\nLinnaeus. But we have killed or badly injured a multitude of plants.\r\nN.B.--_Oxalis carnosa_ was most valuable, but last night was killed.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was published on November 6, 1880, and 1500 copies were\r\ndisposed of at Mr. Murray's sale. With regard to it he wrote to Sir J.\r\nD. Hooker (November 23):--\r\n\r\n\"Your note has pleased me much--for I did not expect that you would have\r\nhad time to read _any_ of it. Read the last chapter, and you will know\r\nthe whole result, but without the evidence. The case, however, of\r\nradicles bending after exposure for an hour to geotropism, with their\r\ntips (or brains) cut off is, I think worth your reading (bottom of p.\r\n525); it astounded me. But I will bother you no more about my book. The\r\nsensitiveness of seedlings to light is marvellous.\"\r\n\r\nTo another friend, Mr. Thiselton Dyer, he wrote (November 28, 1880):\r\n\r\n\"Very many thanks for your most kind note, but you think too highly of\r\nour work, not but what this is very pleasant.... Many of the Germans are\r\nvery contemptuous about making out the use of organs; but they may sneer\r\nthe souls out of their bodies, and I for one shall think it the most\r\ninteresting part of Natural History. Indeed you are greatly mistaken if\r\nyou doubt for one moment on the very great value of your constant and\r\nmost kind assistance to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was widely reviewed, and excited much interest among the\r\ngeneral public. The following letter refers to a leading article in the\r\n_Times_, November 20, 1880:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Mrs. Haliburton._[294] Down, November 22, 1880.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SARAH,--You see how audaciously I begin; but I have always loved\r\nand shall ever love this name. Your letter has done more than please me,\r\nfor its kindness has touched my heart. I often think of old days and of\r\nthe delight of my visits to Woodhouse, and of the deep debt of gratitude\r\nwhich I owe to your father. It was very good of you to write. I had\r\nquite forgotten my old ambition about the Shrewsbury newspaper;[295] but\r\nI remember the pride which I felt when I saw in a book about beetles the\r\nimpressive words \"captured by C. Darwin.\" Captured sounded so grand\r\ncompared with caught. This seemed to me glory enough for any man! I do\r\nnot know in the least what made the _Times_ glorify me, for it has\r\nsometimes pitched into me ferociously.\r\n\r\nI should very much like to see you again, but you would find a visit\r\nhere very dull, for we feel very old and have no amusement, and lead a\r\nsolitary life. But we intend in a few weeks to spend a few days in\r\nLondon, and then if you have anything else to do in London, you would\r\nperhaps come and lunch with us.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Sarah,\r\nYours gratefully and affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter was called forth by the publication of a volume\r\ndevoted to the criticism of the _Power of Movement in Plants_ by an\r\naccomplished botanist, Dr. Julius Wiesner, Professor of Botany in the\r\nUniversity of Vienna:\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Julius Wiesner._ Down, October 25th, 1881.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I have now finished your book,[296] and have understood\r\nthe whole except a very few passages. In the first place, let me thank\r\nyou cordially for the manner in which you have everywhere treated me.\r\nYou have shown how a man may differ from another in the most decided\r\nmanner, and yet express his difference with the most perfect courtesy.\r\nNot a few English and German naturalists might learn a useful lesson\r\nfrom your example; for the coarse language often used by scientific men\r\ntowards each other does no good, and only degrades science.\r\n\r\nI have been profoundly interested by your book, and some of your\r\nexperiments are so beautiful, that I actually felt pleasure while being\r\nvivisected. It would take up too much space to discuss all the important\r\ntopics in your book. I fear that you have quite upset the interpretation\r\nwhich I have given of the effects of cutting off the tips of\r\nhorizontally extended roots, and of those laterally exposed to moisture;\r\nbut I cannot persuade myself that the horizontal position of lateral\r\nbranches and roots is due simply to their lessened power of growth. Nor\r\nwhen I think of my experiments with the cotyledons of _Phalaris_, can I\r\ngive up the belief of the transmission of some stimulus due to light\r\nfrom the upper to the lower part. At p. 60 you have misunderstood my\r\nmeaning, when you say that I believe that the effects from light are\r\ntransmitted to a part which is not itself heliotropic. I never\r\nconsidered whether or not the short part beneath the ground was\r\nheliotropic; but I believe that with young seedlings the part which\r\nbends _near_, but _above_ the ground is heliotropic, and I believe so\r\nfrom this part bending only moderately when the light is oblique, and\r\nbending rectangularly when the light is horizontal. Nevertheless the\r\nbending of this lower part, as I conclude from my experiments with\r\nopaque caps, is influenced by the action of light on the upper part. My\r\nopinion, however, on the above and many other points, signifies very\r\nlittle, for I have no doubt that your book will convince most botanists\r\nthat I am wrong in all the points on which we differ.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the question of transmission, my mind is so full of\r\nfacts leading me to believe that light, gravity, &c., act not in a\r\ndirect manner on growth, but as stimuli, that I am quite unable to\r\nmodify my judgment on this head. I could not understand the passage at\r\np. 78, until I consulted my son George, who is a mathematician. He\r\nsupposes that your objection is founded on the diffused light from the\r\nlamp illuminating both sides of the object, and not being reduced, with\r\nincreasing distance in the same ratio as the direct light; but he doubts\r\nwhether this _necessary_ correction will account for the very little\r\ndifference in the heliotropic curvature of the plants in the successive\r\npots.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the sensitiveness of the tips of roots to contact, I\r\ncannot admit your view until it is proved that I am in error about bits\r\nof card attached by liquid gum causing movement; whereas no movement\r\nwas caused if the card remained separated from the tip by a layer of the\r\nliquid gum. The fact also of thicker and thinner bits of card attached\r\non opposite sides of the same root by shellac, causing movement in one\r\ndirection, has to be explained. You often speak of the tip having been\r\ninjured; but externally there was no sign of injury: and when the tip\r\nwas plainly injured, the extreme part became curved _towards_ the\r\ninjured side. I can no more believe that the tip was injured by the bits\r\nof card, at least when attached by gum-water, than that the glands of\r\nDrosera are injured by a particle of thread or hair placed on it, or\r\nthat the human tongue is so when it feels any such object.\r\n\r\nAbout the most important subject in my book, namely circumnutation, I\r\ncan only say that I feel utterly bewildered at the difference in our\r\nconclusions; but I could not fully understand some parts which my son\r\nFrancis will be able to translate to me when he returns home. The\r\ngreater part of your book is beautifully clear.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish that I had enough strength and spirit to commence a\r\nfresh set of experiments, and publish the results, with a full\r\nrecantation of my errors when convinced of them; but I am too old for\r\nsuch an undertaking, nor do I suppose that I shall be able to do much,\r\nor any more, original work. I imagine that I see one possible source of\r\nerror in your beautiful experiment of a plant rotating and exposed to a\r\nlateral light.\r\n\r\nWith high respect, and with sincere thanks for the kind manner in which\r\nyou have treated me and my mistakes, I remain,\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insectivorous Plants._\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1860 he was staying at the house of his sister-in-law,\r\nMiss Wedgwood, in Ashdown Forest whence he wrote (July 29, 1860), to Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"Latterly I have done nothing here; but at first I amused myself with a\r\nfew observations on the insect-catching power of Drosera:[297] and I\r\nmust consult you some time whether my 'twaddle' is worth communicating\r\nto the Linnean Society.\"\r\n\r\nIn August he wrote to the same friend:--\r\n\r\n\"I will gratefully send my notes on Drosera when copied by my copier:\r\nthe subject amused me when I had nothing to do.\"\r\n\r\nHe has described in the _Autobiography_ (p. 47), the general nature of\r\nthese early experiments. He noticed insects sticking to the leaves, and\r\nfinding that flies, &c., placed on the adhesive glands, were held fast\r\nand embraced, he suspected that the captured prey was digested and\r\nabsorbed by the leaves. He therefore tried the effect on the leaves of\r\nvarious nitrogenous fluids--with results which, as far as they went,\r\nverified his surmise. In September, 1860, he wrote to Dr. Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been infinitely amused by working at Drosera: the movements are\r\nreally curious; and the manner in which the leaves detect certain\r\nnitrogenous compounds is marvellous. You will laugh; but it is, at\r\npresent, my full belief (after endless experiments) that they detect\r\n(and move in consequence of) the 1/2880 part of a single grain of\r\nnitrate of ammonia; but the muriate and sulphate of ammonia bother their\r\nchemical skill, and they cannot make anything of the nitrogen in these\r\nsalts!\"\r\n\r\nLater in the autumn he was again obliged to leave home for Eastbourne,\r\nwhere he continued his work on Drosera.\r\n\r\nOn his return home he wrote to Lyell (November 1860):--\r\n\r\n\"I will and must finish my Drosera MS., which will take me a week, for,\r\nat the present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all\r\nthe species in the world. But I will not publish on Drosera till next\r\nyear, for I am frightened and astounded at my results. I declare it is a\r\ncertain fact, that one organ is so sensitive to touch, that a weight\r\nseventy-eight-times less than that, viz., 1/1000 of a grain, which will\r\nmove the best chemical balance, suffices to cause a conspicuous\r\nmovement. Is it not curious that a plant should be far more sensitive to\r\nthe touch than any nerve in the human body? Yet I am perfectly sure that\r\nthis is true. When I am on my hobby-horse, I never can resist telling my\r\nfriends how well my hobby goes, so you must forgive the rider.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was continued, as a holiday task, at Bournemouth, where he\r\nstayed during the autumn of 1862.\r\n\r\nA long break now ensued in his work on insectivorous plants, and it was\r\nnot till 1872 that the subject seriously occupied him again. A passage\r\nin a letter to Dr. Asa Gray, written in 1863 or 1864, shows, however,\r\nthat the question was not altogether absent from his mind in the\r\ninterim:--\r\n\r\n\"Depend on it you are unjust on the merits of my beloved Drosera; it is\r\na wonderful plant, or rather a most sagacious animal. I will stick up\r\nfor Drosera to the day of my death. Heaven knows whether I shall ever\r\npublish my pile of experiments on it.\"\r\n\r\nHe notes in his diary that the last proof of the _Expression of the\r\nEmotions_ was finished on August 22, 1872, and that he began to work on\r\nDrosera on the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Asa Gray_ [Sevenoaks], October 22 [1872].\r\n\r\n... I have worked pretty hard for four or five weeks on Drosera, and\r\nthen broke down; so that we took a house near Sevenoaks for three weeks\r\n(where I now am) to get complete rest. I have very little power of\r\nworking now, and must put off the rest of the work on Drosera till next\r\nspring, as my plants are dying. It is an endless subject, and I must cut\r\nit short, and for this reason shall not do much on Dionaea. The point\r\nwhich has interested me most is tracing the _nerves_! which follow the\r\nvascular bundles. By a prick with a sharp lancet at a certain point, I\r\ncan paralyse one-half the leaf, so that a stimulus to the other half\r\ncauses no movement. It is just like dividing the spinal marrow of a\r\nfrog:--no stimulus can be sent from the brain or anterior part of the\r\nspine to the hind legs: but if these latter are stimulated, they move by\r\nreflex action. I find my old results about the astonishing sensitiveness\r\nof the nervous system (!?) of Drosera to various stimulants fully\r\nconfirmed and extended....\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. D. to Asa Gray_, Down, June 3 [1874].\r\n\r\n... I am now hard at work getting my book on Drosera & Co. ready for the\r\nprinters, but it will take some time, for I am always finding out new\r\npoints to observe. I think you will be interested by my observations on\r\nthe digestive process in Drosera; the secretion contains an acid of the\r\nacetic series, and some ferment closely analogous to, but not identical\r\nwith, pepsine; for I have been making a long series of comparative\r\ntrials. No human being will believe what I shall publish about the\r\nsmallness of the doses of phosphate of ammonia which act....\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of _Insectivorous Plants_ was finished in March 1875. He\r\nseems to have been more than usually oppressed by the writing of this\r\nbook, thus he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker in February:--\r\n\r\n\"You ask about my book, and all that I can say is that I am ready to\r\ncommit suicide; I thought it was decently written, but find so much\r\nwants rewriting, that it will not be ready to go to printers for two\r\nmonths, and will then make a confoundedly big book. Murray will say that\r\nit is no use publishing in the middle of summer, so I do not know what\r\nwill be the upshot; but I begin to think that every one who publishes a\r\nbook is a fool.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was published on July 2nd, 1875, and 2700 copies were sold out\r\nof the edition of 3000.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Kew Index of Plant-Names._\r\n\r\nSome account of my father's connection with the _Index of Plant-Names_,\r\nnow (1892) being printed by the Clarendon Press, will be found in Mr. B.\r\nDaydon Jackson's paper in the _Journal of Botany_, 1887, p. 151. Mr.\r\nJackson quotes the following statement by Sir J. D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"Shortly before his death, Mr. Charles Darwin informed Sir Joseph Hooker\r\nthat it was his intention to devote a considerable sum of money annually\r\nfor some years in aid or furtherance of some work or works of practical\r\nutility to biological science, and to make provisions in his will in the\r\nevent of these not being completed during his lifetime.\r\n\r\n\"Amongst other objects connected with botanical science, Mr. Darwin\r\nregarded with especial interest the importance of a complete index to\r\nthe names and authors of the genera and species of plants known to\r\nbotanists, together with their native countries. Steudel's _Nomenclator_\r\nis the only existing work of this nature, and although now nearly half a\r\ncentury old, Mr. Darwin had found it of great aid in his own researches.\r\nIt has been indispensable to every botanical institution, whether as a\r\nlist of all known flowering plants, as an indication of their authors,\r\nor as a digest of botanical geography.\"\r\n\r\nSince 1840, when the _Nomenclator_ was published, the number of\r\ndescribed plants may be said to have doubled, so that Steudel is now\r\nseriously below the requirements of botanical work. To remedy this want,\r\nthe _Nomenclator_ has been from time to time posted up in an interleaved\r\ncopy in the Herbarium at Kew, by the help of \"funds supplied by private\r\nliberality.\"[298]\r\n\r\nMy father, like other botanists, had, as Sir Joseph Hooker points out,\r\nexperienced the value of Steudel's work. He obtained plants from all\r\nsorts of sources, which were often incorrectly named, and he felt the\r\nnecessity of adhering to the accepted nomenclature so that he might\r\nconvey to other workers precise indications as to the plants which he\r\nhad studied. It was also frequently a matter of importance to him to\r\nknow the native country of his experimental plants. Thus it was natural\r\nthat he should recognise the desirability of completing and publishing\r\nthe interleaved volume at Kew. The wish to help in this object was\r\nheightened by the admiration he felt for the results for which the world\r\nhas to thank the Royal Gardens at Kew, and by his gratitude for the\r\ninvaluable aid which for so many years he received from its Director and\r\nhis staff. He expressly stated that it was his wish \"to aid in some way\r\nthe scientific work carried on at the Royal Gardens\"[299]--which induced\r\nhim to offer to supply funds for the completion of the Kew\r\n_Nomenclator_.\r\n\r\nThe following passage, for which I am indebted to Professor Judd, is of\r\ninterest, as illustrating, the motives that actuated my father in this\r\nmatter. Professor Judd writes:--\r\n\r\n\"On the occasion of my last visit to him, he told me that his income\r\nhaving recently greatly increased, while his wants remained the same, he\r\nwas most anxious to devote what he could spare to the advancement of\r\nGeology or Biology. He dwelt in the most touching manner on the fact\r\nthat he owed so much happiness and fame to the natural history sciences,\r\nwhich had been the solace of what might have been a painful\r\nexistence;--and he begged me, if I knew of any research which could be\r\naided by a grant of a few hundreds of pounds, to let him know, as it\r\nwould be a delight to him to feel that he was helping in promoting the\r\nprogress of science. He informed me at the same time that he was making\r\nthe same suggestion to Sir Joseph Hooker and Professor Huxley with\r\nrespect to Botany and Zoology respectively. I was much impressed by the\r\nearnestness, and, indeed, deep emotion, with which he spoke of his\r\nindebtedness to Science, and his desire to promote its interests.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan of the proposed work having been carefully considered, Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker was able to confide its elaboration in detail to Mr. B.\r\nDaydon Jackson, Secretary of the Linnean Society, whose extensive\r\nknowledge of botanical literature qualifies him for the task. My\r\nfather's original idea of producing a modern edition of Steudel's\r\n_Nomenclator_ has been practically abandoned, the aim now kept in view\r\nis rather to construct a list of genera and species (with references)\r\nfounded on Bentham and Hooker's _Genera Plantarum_. Under Sir Joseph\r\nHooker's supervision, the work, carried out with admirable zeal by Mr.\r\nJackson, goes steadily forward. The colossal nature of the undertaking\r\nmay be estimated by the fact that the manuscript of the _Index_ is at\r\nthe present time (1892) believed to weigh more than a ton.\r\n\r\nThe Kew 'Index,' will be a fitting memorial of my father: and his share\r\nin its completion illustrates a part of his character--his ready\r\nsympathy with work outside his own lines of investigation--and his\r\nrespect for minute and patient labour in all branches of science.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[290] _Proc.

The subject of\r\nhealth appears more prominently than is often necessary in a Biography,\r\nbecause it was, unfortunately, so real an element in determining the\r\noutward form of his life.\r\n\r\nMy father was at one time in the hands of Dr. Bence Jones, from whose\r\ntreatment he certainly derived benefit. In later years he became a\r\npatient of Sir Andrew Clark, under whose care he improved greatly in\r\ngeneral health. It was not only for his generously rendered service that\r\nmy father felt a debt of gratitude towards Sir Andrew Clark. He owed to\r\nhis cheering personal influence an often-repeated encouragement, which\r\nlatterly added something real to his happiness, and he found sincere\r\npleasure in Sir Andrew's friendship and kindness towards himself and his\r\nchildren. During the last ten years of his life the state of his health\r\nwas a cause of satisfaction and hope to his family. His condition showed\r\nsigns of amendment in several particulars. He suffered less distress and\r\ndiscomfort, and was able to work more steadily.\r\n\r\nScattered through his letters are one or two references to pain or\r\nuneasiness felt in the region of the heart. How far these indicate that\r\nthe heart was affected early in life, I cannot pretend to say; in any\r\ncase it is certain that he had no serious or permanent trouble of this\r\nnature until shortly before his death. In spite of the general\r\nimprovement in his health, which has been above alluded to, there was a\r\ncertain loss of physical vigour occasionally apparent during the last\r\nfew years of his life. This is illustrated by a sentence in a letter to\r\nhis old friend Sir James Sulivan, written on January 10, 1879: \"My\r\nscientific work tires me more than it used to do, but I have nothing\r\nelse to do, and whether one is worn out a year or two sooner or later\r\nsignifies but little.\"\r\n\r\nA similar feeling is shown in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker of June 15,\r\n1881. My father was staying at Patterdale, and wrote: \"I am rather\r\ndespondent about myself.... I have not the heart or strength to begin\r\nany investigation lasting years, which is the only thing I enjoy, and I\r\nhave no little jobs which I can do.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1881, he wrote to Mr. Wallace: \"We have just returned home\r\nafter spending five weeks on Ullswater; the scenery is quite charming,\r\nbut I cannot walk, and everything tires me, even seeing scenery.... What\r\nI shall do with my few remaining years of life I can hardly tell. I have\r\neverything to make me happy and contented, but life has become very\r\nwearisome to me.\" He was, however, able to do a good deal of work, and\r\nthat of a trying sort,[300] during the autumn of 1881, but towards the\r\nend of the year, he was clearly in need of rest: and during the winter\r\nwas in a lower condition than was usual with him.\r\n\r\nOn December 13, he went for a week to his daughter's house in Bryanston\r\nStreet. During his stay in London he went to call on Mr. Romanes, and\r\nwas seized when on the door-step with an attack apparently of the same\r\nkind as those which afterwards became so frequent. The rest of the\r\nincident, which I give in Mr. Romanes' words, is interesting too from a\r\ndifferent point of view, as giving one more illustration of my father's\r\nscrupulous consideration for others:--\r\n\r\n\"I happened to be out, but my butler, observing that Mr. Darwin was ill,\r\nasked him to come in. He said he would prefer going home, and although\r\nthe butler urged him to wait at least until a cab could be fetched, he\r\nsaid he would rather not give so much trouble. For the same reason he\r\nrefused to allow the butler to accompany him. Accordingly he watched him\r\nwalking with difficulty towards the direction in which cabs were to be\r\nmet with, and saw that, when he had got about three hundred yards from\r\nthe house, he staggered and caught hold of the park-railings as if to\r\nprevent himself from falling. The butler therefore hastened to his\r\nassistance, but after a few seconds saw him turn round with the evident\r\npurpose of retracing his steps to my house. However, after he had\r\nreturned part of the way he seems to have felt better, for he again\r\nchanged his mind, and proceeded to find a cab.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of February and in the beginning of March, attacks\r\nof pain in the region of the heart, with irregularity of the pulse,\r\nbecame frequent, coming on indeed nearly every afternoon. A seizure of\r\nthis sort occurred about March 7, when he was walking alone at a short\r\ndistance from the house; he got home with difficulty, and this was the\r\nlast time that he was able to reach his favourite 'Sand-walk.' Shortly\r\nafter this, his illness became obviously more serious and alarming, and\r\nhe was seen by Sir Andrew Clark, whose treatment was continued by Dr.\r\nNorman Moore, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and Dr. Allfrey, at that\r\ntime in practice at St. Mary Cray. He suffered from distressing\r\nsensations of exhaustion and faintness, and seemed to recognise with\r\ndeep depression the fact that his working days were over. He gradually\r\nrecovered from this condition, and became more cheerful and hopeful, as\r\nis shown in the following letter to Mr. Huxley, who was anxious that my\r\nfather should have closer medical supervision than the existing\r\narrangements allowed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Down, March 27, 1882.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR HUXLEY,--Your most kind letter has been a real cordial to me. I\r\nhave felt better to-day than for three weeks, and have felt as yet no\r\npain. Your plan seems an excellent one, and I will probably act upon it,\r\nunless I get very much better. Dr. Clark's kindness is unbounded to me,\r\nbut he is too busy to come here. Once again, accept my cordial thanks,\r\nmy dear old friend. I wish to God there were more automata[301] in the\r\nworld like you.\r\n\r\n\"Ever yours,\r\n\"CH. DARWIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe allusion to Sir Andrew Clark requires a word of explanation. Sir\r\nAndrew himself was ever ready to devote himself to my father, who\r\nhowever, could not endure the thought of sending for him, knowing how\r\nseverely his great practice taxed his strength.\r\n\r\nNo especial change occurred during the beginning of April, but on\r\nSaturday 15th he was seized with giddiness while sitting at dinner in\r\nthe evening, and fainted in an attempt to reach his sofa. On the 17th he\r\nwas again better, and in my temporary absence recorded for me the\r\nprogress of an experiment in which I was engaged. During the night of\r\nApril 18th, about a quarter to twelve, he had a severe attack and passed\r\ninto a faint, from which he was brought back to consciousness with great\r\ndifficulty. He seemed to recognise the approach of death, and said, \"I\r\nam not the least afraid to die.\" All the next morning he suffered from\r\nterrible nausea and faintness, and hardly rallied before the end came.\r\n\r\nHe died at about four o'clock on Wednesday, April 19th, 1882, in the\r\n74th year of his age.\r\n\r\nI close the record of my father's life with a few words of retrospect\r\nadded to the manuscript of his _Autobiography_ in 1879:--\r\n\r\n\"As for myself, I believe that I have acted rightly in steadily\r\nfollowing and devoting my life to Science. I feel no remorse from having\r\ncommitted any great sin, but have often and often regretted that I have\r\nnot done more direct good to my fellow creatures.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[300] On the action of carbonate of ammonia on roots and leaves.\r\n\r\n[301] The allusion is to Mr. Huxley's address, \"On the hypothesis that\r\nanimals are automata, and its history,\" given at the Belfast Meeting of\r\nthe British Association, 1874, and republished in _Science and Culture_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nTHE FUNERAL IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Friday succeeding my father's death, the following letter, signed\r\nby twenty Members of Parliament, was addressed to Dr. Bradley, Dean of\r\nWestminster:--\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, April 21, 1882.\r\n\r\nVERY REV. SIR,--We hope you will not think we are taking a liberty if we\r\nventure to suggest that it would be acceptable to a very large number of\r\nour fellow-countrymen of all classes and opinions that our illustrious\r\ncountryman, Mr. Darwin, should be buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nWe remain, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\nJOHN LUBBOCK,\r\nNEVIL STOREY MASKELYNE,\r\nA. J. MUNDELLA,\r\nG. O. TREVELYAN,\r\nLYON PLAYFAIR,\r\nCHARLES W. DILKE,\r\nDAVID WEDDERBURN,\r\nARTHUR RUSSELL,\r\nHORACE DAVEY,\r\nBENJAMIN ARMITAGE,\r\nRICHARD B. MARTIN,\r\nFRANCIS W.

CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN,\r\nCHARLES BRUCE,\r\nRICHARD FORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dean was abroad at the time, and telegraphed his cordial\r\nacquiescence.\r\n\r\nThe family had desired that my father should be buried at Down: with\r\nregard to their wishes, Sir John Lubbock wrote:--\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, April 25, 1882.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--I quite sympathise with your feeling, and personally I\r\nshould greatly have preferred that your father should have rested in\r\nDown amongst us all. It is, I am sure, quite understood that the\r\ninitiative was not taken by you. Still, from a national point of view,\r\nit is clearly right that he should be buried in the Abbey. I esteem it a\r\ngreat privilege to be allowed to accompany my dear master to the grave.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours most sincerely,\r\nJOHN LUBBOCK.\r\nW. E. DARWIN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family gave up their first-formed plans, and the funeral took place\r\nin Westminster Abbey on April 26th. The pall-bearers were:--\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN LUBBOCK,\r\nMR. HUXLEY,\r\nMR. JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL (American Minister),\r\nMR. A. R. WALLACE,\r\nTHE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE,\r\nCANON FARRAR,\r\nSIR JOSEPH HOOKER,\r\nMR. WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE (President of the Royal Society),\r\nTHE EARL OF DERBY,\r\nTHE DUKE OF ARGYLL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funeral was attended by the representatives of France, Germany,\r\nItaly, Spain, Russia, and by those of the Universities and learned\r\nSocieties, as well as by large numbers of personal friends and\r\ndistinguished men.\r\n\r\nThe grave is in the north aisle of the Nave, close to the angle of the\r\nchoir-screen, and a few feet from the grave of Sir Isaac Newton. The\r\nstone bears the inscription--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES ROBERT DARWIN.\r\nBorn 12 February, 1809.\r\nDied 19 April, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n-----+------------------+-----------------+--------------------\r\nDate.|Description.      |Artist.          |In the Possession of\r\n-----+------------------+-----------------+--------------------\r\n1838 |Water-colour      |G.
