M. Stunz_\r\n\r\n    _Alas! that spring should vanish with the rose!_\r\n    _That youth’s sweet-scented manuscript should close!_\r\n                                         —OMAR KHAYYAM.\r\n\r\nA secret vital to human happiness has been discovered. An ancient problem\r\nwhich, sooner or later, affects the welfare of virtually every man and\r\nwoman, has been solved. As this problem undoubtedly will come to you\r\neventually, if it has not come already, I urge you to read this article\r\ncarefully. It may give you information of a value beyond all price.\r\n\r\nThis newly-revealed secret is not a new “philosophy” of financial\r\nsuccess. It is not a political panacea. It has to do with something of\r\nfar greater moment to the individual—success and happiness in love and\r\nmarriage—and there is nothing theoretical, imaginative or fantastic\r\nabout it, because it comes from the coldly exact realms of science and\r\nits value has been proved. It “works.” And because it does work—surely,\r\nspeedily and most delightfully—it is one of the most important\r\ndiscoveries made in many years. Thousands already bless it for having\r\nrescued them from lives of disappointment and misery. Millions will\r\nrejoice because of it in years to come.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar value of this discovery is that it removes physical\r\nhandicaps which, in the past, have been considered inevitable and\r\nirremediable. I refer to the loss of youthful animation and a\r\nwaning of the vital forces. These difficulties have caused untold\r\nunhappiness—failures, shattered romances, mysterious divorces. True\r\nhappiness does not depend on wealth, position or fame. Primarily, it is\r\na matter of health. Not the inefficient, “half-alive” condition which\r\nordinarily passes as “health,” but the abundant, vibrant, magnetic\r\nvitality of superb manhood and womanhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this kind of health is rare. Our civilization, with its\r\nwear and tear, rapidly depletes the organism and, in a physical sense,\r\nold age comes on when life should be at its prime.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a tragedy of our era alone. Ages ago a Persian poet,\r\nin the world’s most melodious epic of pessimism, voiced humanity’s\r\nimmemorial complaint that “spring should vanish with the rose” and the\r\nsong of youth too soon come to an end. And for centuries before Omar\r\nKhayyam wrote his immortal verses, science had searched—and in the\r\ncenturies that have passed since then has continued to search—without\r\nhalt, for the fabled “fountain of youth,” an infallible method of\r\nrenewing energy lost or depleted by disease, overwork, worry, excesses or\r\nadvancing age.\r\n\r\nNow the long search has been rewarded. A “fountain of youth” has been\r\nfound! Science announces unconditionally that youthful vigor can be\r\nrestored quickly and safely. Lives clouded by weakness can be illumined\r\nby the sunlight of health and joy. Old age, in a sense, can be kept at\r\nbay and youth made more glorious than ever. And the discovery which makes\r\nthese amazing results possible is something any man or woman, young or\r\nold, can easily use in the privacy of the home, unknown to relative,\r\nfriend or acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe discovery had its origin in famous European laboratories. Brought to\r\nAmerica, it was developed into a product that has given most remarkable\r\nresults in thousands of cases, many of which had defied all other\r\ntreatments. In scientific circles the discovery has been known and used\r\nfor several years and has caused unbounded amazement by its quick,\r\nharmless, gratifying action. Now in convenient tablet form, under the\r\nname of Korex compound, it is available to the general public.\r\n\r\nAny one who finds the youthful stamina ebbing, life losing its charm\r\nand color or the feebleness of old age coming on too soon, can obtain\r\na double-strength treatment of this compound, sufficient for ordinary\r\ncases, under a positive guarantee that it costs nothing if it fails and\r\nonly $2 if it produces prompt and gratifying results. In average cases,\r\nthe compound often brings about amazing benefits in from twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nSimply write in confidence to the Melton Laboratories, 833 Massachusetts\r\nBldg., Kansas City, Mo., and this wonder restorative will be mailed to\r\nyou in a plain wrapper. You may enclose $2 or, if you prefer, just send\r\nyour name without money and pay the postman $2 and postage when the\r\nparcel is delivered. In either case, if you report after a week that the\r\nKorex compound has not given satisfactory results, your money will be\r\nrefunded immediately. The Melton Laboratories are nationally known and\r\nthoroughly reliable. Moreover, their offer is fully guaranteed, so no\r\none need hesitate to accept it. If you need this remarkable scientific\r\nrejuvenator, write for it today.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Cleanest, Yet Most Outspoken, Book Published\r\n\r\nThere is not a man or woman married or unmarried, who does not need to\r\nknow every word contained in “Sex Conduct in Marriage.” The very numerous\r\ntragedies which occur every day, show the necessity for plain-spokenness\r\nand honest discussion of the most vital part of married life.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive of the value of the book; it must\r\nundoubtedly be read to be appreciated, and it is obviously impossible\r\nto give here a complete summary of its contents. The knowledge is not\r\nobtainable elsewhere; there is a conspiracy of silence on the essential\r\nmatters concerning sex conduct, and the object of the author has been\r\nto break the barriers of convention in this respect, recognizing as he\r\ndoes that no marriage can be a truly happy one unless both partners are\r\nfree to express the deepest feelings they have for each other without\r\ndegrading themselves or bringing into the world undesired children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe author is an idealist who recognizes the sacredness of the sex\r\nfunction and the right of children to be loved and desired before they\r\nare born. Very, very few of us can say truly that we were the outcome of\r\nthe conscious desire of our parents to beget us. They, however, were not\r\nto blame because they had not the knowledge which would have enabled them\r\nto control conception.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, see that our own marriage conduct brings us happiness and\r\nenjoyment in itself and for our children.\r\n\r\nA Book for Idealists by an Idealist\r\n\r\nThe greatest necessity to insure happiness in the married condition is to\r\nknow its obligations and privileges, and to have a sound understanding\r\nof sex conduct. This great book gives this information and is absolutely\r\nreliable throughout.\r\n\r\nDr. P. L. Clark, B. S., M. D., writing of this book says: “As regards\r\nsound principles and frank discussion I know no better book on this\r\nsubject than Bernard Bernard’s ‘Sex Conduct in Marriage.’ I strongly\r\nadvise all members of the Health School in need of reliable information\r\nto read this book.”\r\n\r\n“I feel grateful but cheated,” writes one man. “Grateful for the new\r\nunderstanding and joy in living that has come to us, cheated that we have\r\nlived five years without it.”\r\n\r\nSEX CONDUCT IN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nBy BERNARD BERNARD Editor-in-Chief of “Health and Life”\r\n\r\nAnswers simply and directly, those intimate questions which Mr. Bernard\r\nhas been called upon to answer innumerable times before, both personally\r\nand by correspondence. It is a simple, straightforward explanation,\r\nunclouded by ancient fetish or superstition.\r\n\r\nA few of the many headings are:—\r\n\r\n    When the Sex Function Should Be Used.\r\n    Sex Tragedies in Childhood.\r\n    The Consummation of Marriage.\r\n    The Art of a Beautiful Conception.\r\n    Sex Communion.\r\n    The Scientific Control of Conception.\r\n    Sex Fear Destroyed.\r\n    The Frequency of the Sex Act.\r\n    The Initiation to Matrimony.\r\n    Anatomy and Physiology of the Sex Organs.\r\n    The Spontaneous Expression of Love.\r\n    Why Women Have Been Subjected.\r\n    Men Who Marry in Ignorance.\r\n    Hereditary Passion.\r\n    Marriage a Joy to the End.\r\n\r\nSend your check or money order today for only $1.75 and this remarkable\r\nbook will be sent postpaid immediately in a plain wrapper.\r\n\r\n                       Health and Life Publications\r\n                    Room 46-333 South Dearborn Street\r\n                                 CHICAGO\r\n\r\n                      HEALTH AND LIFE PUBLICATIONS\r\n                      Room 46-333 S.

They formed a\r\ndecidedly incongruous pair; for the first to alight was a diminutive\r\nChinese boy, scantily dressed, while his companion appeared to be a\r\nportly white man.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to be sure of this fact, however, as this second\r\npassenger wore a long overcoat, with its ulster collar turned up around\r\nhis face, and a dark cloth cap with the visor drawn down over his\r\nforehead and eyes.\r\n\r\nEvidently the cab driver had been paid in advance, for he swung out from\r\nthe curb as soon as his fares had dismounted, and was soon out of sight.\r\nThe Chinese boy glanced at his companion, then set off silently up a\r\nstreet whose central portion was paved with cobblestones.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to know just where he was going. He paused only once, to cast a\r\nfleeting glance over his shoulder. Then he resumed his journey.\r\n\r\nHe had seen that the man in the ulster was following; and now, after\r\ntraversing half a block of squalid, deserted street, the youngster turned\r\nabruptly into a pestilential-looking alley. This alley lay close to the\r\ntop of a hill, and for a moment the man and the boy, who appeared to be\r\nhis guide, could look down over the roofs to where the gay lights of\r\nChinatown twinkled alluringly.\r\n\r\nPresently the diminutive Oriental paused just outside a doorway. The\r\nman who had been following him came up, with a curious suggestion of\r\neagerness and suspicion. Looking over the shoulder of the figure before\r\nhim, he was able to make out the entrance to a narrow flight of unlighted\r\nstairs, which plunged steeply into the earth beneath a dilapidated\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n“Do we have to go down there, boy?” the man demanded.\r\n\r\n“All a-same down here, master,” the youngster replied. “You come close—I\r\nshow you!”\r\n\r\nHe began to descend as he spoke; and the man, after a moment of\r\nhesitation, plunged through the doorway after him. His manner was that of\r\none who is taking a horribly unpleasant remedy, hoping to cure a still\r\nmore horrible disease.\r\n\r\nThe diminutive Chinaman reached the bottom of the stairs and waited for\r\nhis companion. When he felt the man’s heavy hand on his shoulder, he\r\nturned to his right, advancing cautiously through an almost impenetrable\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThere was a smell of dry rot in this basement, and around their feet rats\r\nscampered and squeaked. The man’s hand shook, and his breath came with a\r\nhissing sound through his clenched teeth.\r\n\r\n“Now we go down again, master,” the boy announced presently. He had\r\npaused and turned again to the right. “You keep close—I show you!”\r\n\r\nA step at a time, they descended a second flight of stairs. On either\r\nside were rough stone walls, powdery with mildew. The man discovered this\r\nwith his free left hand. Strange odors came to him. Abruptly a bell rang,\r\nsomewhere in the bowels of the darkness below them.\r\n\r\nThe boy stopped in his tracks.\r\n\r\n“Now you go down, master,” he commanded. “Ah Wing waiting for you—you go\r\nslow. Goo’-by!”\r\n\r\nHe slipped out from under the heavy hand that would have detained him,\r\nand the man heard him go scampering like one of the rats up the stairs\r\nand away through the upper corridors.\r\n\r\nTerror gripped the man left alone there on the stairs. He felt that he\r\nwas in a trap—and he had been evading traps so long now that they had\r\nbecome an obsession with him.\r\n\r\nHe cried out, hoarsely, and as he did so a door opened below and a flood\r\nof light shone out.\r\n\r\n“Pray continue your descent, Colonel Knight,” a cultured voice commanded\r\nfrom somewhere within the lighted room whose door had just opened. “The\r\nstairs are quite secure, and I am awaiting you!”\r\n\r\nWith a plunge that hinted at desperation, the man addressed as “Colonel\r\nKnight” reached the bottom of the stairs and crossed to the door. He\r\npaused there for a moment, till his eyes adjusted themselves to the\r\nchange in illumination. Then he stepped inside, and heard the heavy door\r\nclose behind him.\r\n\r\nThe room he had entered was of considerable extent, but was almost\r\ndestitute of furniture. There were bare walls, dusty with green mildew;\r\nand bare floors, covered with layers of dust and litter. There were two\r\nchairs, one of which was already occupied.\r\n\r\nAnd as the newcomer’s eyes rested on the occupant of that chair, all his\r\ndoubts and fears returned to him. He had come to this unearthly spot\r\nto get away from almost certain death. Now he was not certain that the\r\nremedy would not prove worse than the disease.\r\n\r\nThe man sitting there, facing him, was dressed like a Chinaman, in silk\r\ntrousers and coat, satin slippers, and black silk cap; but his eyes were\r\nof a metallic gray, and his high, thin-bridged nose spoke of Nordic\r\nblood. He would have been tall had he been standing. His hands were lying\r\npassive in his lap, but they were the hands of a man of great physical\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAnd above all these details and beyond them was something the man in the\r\nulster could not quite define—a radiation of power, as if the intellect\r\nand will of this strange being seated before him saturated the atmosphere\r\nof the empty room.\r\n\r\n“Pray be seated, Colonel Knight!” the man in the chair said courteously.\r\n“I am glad to meet you. You have been recommended to me by a former\r\nstudent of mine—you know that I take only a few cases. It will be best\r\nfor you to tell me your story, fully and accurately.”\r\n\r\nColonel Knight lowered himself into the empty chair. His eyes still\r\npeered out through the gap in his collar, and seemed to be fastened on\r\nthe face of the man before him.\r\n\r\nThen, slowly and grudgingly he removed his cap and turned down his\r\ncollar, disclosing the pouchy face of a man well advanced into middle\r\nage. It was a face suggesting daring and resourcefulness, this face of\r\nColonel Knight; and for a few moments the two sat staring curiously at\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n“I think I can condense that statement I have to make,” the white man\r\nsaid finally. “I am a man of wealth. Five years ago, while traveling in\r\nEurope, I had the misfortune to attract the attention of the greatest\r\ngang of international thieves ever organized. Perhaps you have heard of\r\nthem? They were called ‘The Evening Wolves,’ and were led by a man who\r\ncalled himself ‘Count von Hondon’.”\r\n\r\nHe paused for an instant to regard his companion curiously, but the\r\nOriental merely bowed and sat impassively waiting.\r\n\r\n“These men must have followed me about for some time before they struck.\r\nFinally they saw their chance. I was packed to leave Paris for Belgium,\r\nand they undoubtedly figured that I would have much of wealth with me.\r\n\r\n“I did—but I had other things they had overlooked. I had my pistols,\r\nand I am a dead shot. I killed two of the robbers, and the rest fled. I\r\nsupposed that would settle the matter, but I was mistaken. Five members\r\nof the gang were left alive, and they swore to be revenged upon me. They\r\nhave followed me—”\r\n\r\nA bell rang shrilly somewhere close at hand, and Colonel Knight leaped\r\nfrom his chair and looked wildly at his companion.\r\n\r\n“What was that?” he cried. “That bell rang when I was descending the\r\nstairs—”\r\n\r\n“Someone followed you here,” the other replied, “and is now trying to\r\nreach us. Pray continue!”\r\n\r\n“But that man upon the stairs—”\r\n\r\n“We will come to him presently. Let me ask you to finish!”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing more! I have been followed for years, and now a\r\nphysical trouble is added—my physician tells me I am going blind. I can’t\r\nsee to run—”\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman eyed his companion deliberately.\r\n\r\n“Why lie to me, my friend?” he demanded presently. “You come to me for\r\nhelp, and you wish to steal my ammunition! Now let me reconstruct your\r\nstory for you. You yourself are ‘Count von Hondon.’ You were the leader\r\nof the master crooks called ‘The Evening Wolves.’ Five years ago you\r\nand your men made a rich haul, and you decided that a time had come to\r\nretire, or perhaps to go in by yourself. You departed, taking with you\r\nthe loot; and ever since it has been a running fight.\r\n\r\n“Your old comrades could have shot you outright, but that would not\r\nrestore to them the booty you stole. And you have not dared dispose of\r\nit, because it was the only thing that stood between you and death! You\r\nsee, you can’t lie to me. Every lie carries its trade-mark with it, to\r\nthose who have eyes to see. Now I shall ask you but one question, and let\r\nme warn you—if you lie now, you will never leave this place alive!”\r\n\r\nHe stood up and thrust an accusing finger toward the cowering thief.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” said the Chinaman, “the name of the person whom you and your\r\nmen robbed!”\r\n\r\nThe beady eyes of Colonel Knight, or “Count von Hondon” as he had once\r\nbeen known in every capital in Europe, glittered with suspicion and\r\nfear. His breath caught in his throat, and he unfastened his collar with\r\ntrembling fingers.\r\n\r\n“The name,” he said hoarsely, “was—was—”\r\n\r\nAh Wing crossed toward the heavy door and laid his hand upon the knob.\r\nHis metallic eyes blazed, and he looked down with fierce contempt upon\r\nthe man trembling before him.\r\n\r\n“Will you answer?” he cried. “Or shall I open this door?”\r\n\r\n“It was a woman!” Knight whimpered. “Her name was—Madame Celia—”\r\n\r\nHe broke off and stared at the Chinaman, towering there before the\r\ndoor. Ah Wing had neither spoken nor moved; but there was in the room a\r\ndisturbance as if a great voice had shouted out a curse.\r\n\r\nSlowly the Chinaman came back toward his visitor. His face now was the\r\nimpassive face of a carved Buddha.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Knight,” he said gently, “the high gods have undoubtedly brought\r\nyou to me. I am the only person in the world who can save you, for I\r\nwork outside of the laws of men. And I will take your case, now that I\r\nfully understand it. But first I will ask you to show me the Resurrection\r\nPendant which you stole from Madame Celia!”\r\n\r\nThe white man got slowly to his feet, his hands groping at his throat,\r\nhis eyes protruding, his face the color of dough.\r\n\r\n“The pendant!” he whispered through ashen lips. “The Resurrection\r\nPendant! You know—you have heard?”\r\n\r\n“Show me the Pendant,” repeated Ah Wing inexorably. “I know that you\r\nbrought it with you tonight, just as I know that you intended, in case I\r\nrefused to take your case, to try to disappear without returning to your\r\nhotel. Show me the Pendant!”\r\n\r\nWith faltering hands and without removing his fearful eyes from the face\r\nof his companion, the crook reached inside his ulster and drew forth a\r\npackage wrapped in brown paper. This he slowly unfastened, disclosing a\r\njewel case. More and more slowly his fingers fumbled with the catch.\r\n\r\nThere came a sound from the door—a voice that seemed to have difficulty\r\nin filtering through the heavy panels.\r\n\r\n“Come out of that, Count! We got you over a barrel! Come out—”\r\n\r\nThe massive door shook under a terrific blow, as from a sledge. The man\r\nin the ulster seemed about to crumple to the floor.\r\n\r\nAh Wing spoke coldly.\r\n\r\n“Show me the Pendant!” he repeated. “They cannot break down that door,\r\nbut if you trifle with me I will open it!”\r\n\r\nWith hurried fingers the terror-stricken crook threw back the cover of\r\nthe jewel case, disclosing a mass of diamonds, intricately and skilfully\r\nassembled into a great pendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER TWO_\r\n\r\nUNDER CHINATOWN\r\n\r\nAh Wing took a long stride, which brought him close to the man who held\r\nthe jewel case.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental’s steely eyes were fastened unwaveringly upon the pendant,\r\nwhose history for half a century had been transcribed in suffering\r\nand death. Misfortune had followed this unique assemblage of perfect\r\nstones: death and insanity; the breaking of friendships; the treachery\r\nof children toward parents; the murder of lover by lover. And now the\r\nmysterious Chinaman seemed to have fallen under the spell of the gems,\r\nfor he was taking in every detail of their perfection.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the assault upon the door had ceased, but now it was\r\ncontinued. Heavy blows fell, and the walls of the subterranean apartment\r\nshook.\r\n\r\n“It will not take your friends long to discover that they cannot reach us\r\nby that route,” commented Ah Wing tranquilly, turning at last from his\r\ninspection of the Resurrection Pendant. “The door has a middle sheeting\r\nof boiler iron. It is bullet proof.”\r\n\r\nHe reseated himself, motioning for Colonel Knight to do the same.\r\nAbsently he watched the white man close the jewel case, wrap it carefully\r\nin brown paper, and return it to his ulster pocket.\r\n\r\n“And now,” continued the Chinaman, “I will ask you to tell me about these\r\nmen. You say there are five of them? Please describe them to me, one at\r\na time. Tell me all that you can remember as to physical and mental\r\ncharacteristics—I want every detail you can give me.”\r\n\r\nColonel Knight sat down heavily. It was obvious that the assault upon the\r\ndoor was shaking his nerves so that he could hardly command his voice.\r\nHis eyes were the eyes of some hunted thing, which sees itself at the end\r\nof a blind alley.\r\n\r\nWith an evident effort, he tore his glance from the quivering panels and\r\nfastened it on his companion.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said hollowly, “there are five of these men, and they have been\r\nchosen from the elite of the criminal world. I myself selected them and\r\ntrained them. Each has his special ability. I will begin with the man\r\nwhom I considered the brainiest of them all—the one who was almost my\r\nequal in planning and executing a really big robbery. His name is Monte\r\nJerome.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the blows on the door ceased; and the room was so still, after\r\nthe ferocious assault, that it seemed to press on the ear drums of the\r\nspeaker. He winced and for a moment was silent. Then, resolutely he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n“Monte is thirty-five years old. He is less than five feet six, but is\r\nbroad shouldered and powerful. He grew up in the alleys of a large city.\r\nHe fought his way to the leadership of gang after gang, and at the time I\r\npicked him up was looking for new worlds to conquer. I chose him because\r\nof four qualities: his physical strength; his native cunning; his lack of\r\nsentiment—or, as it is usually called, ‘mercy’—and his absolute freedom\r\nfrom superstition. Monte believes in neither God, man, nor the devil. He\r\nwas my right-hand man—and it is to his merciless pursuit that I owe my\r\ncondition!”\r\n\r\nAh Wing had drawn a note-book from his pocket and was jotting down data.\r\nHe glanced placidly toward the door, which was again shaking under a rain\r\nof heavy blows.\r\n\r\n“Pray continue!” said he.\r\n\r\nSomething of the Chinaman’s imperturbability was beginning to influence\r\nthe white man. He went on with greater assurance:\r\n\r\n“Next to Monte Jerome in total ability, I always placed the man we called\r\n‘Doc.’ I never knew his real name. That was not important, as he went\r\nunder many aliases. Doc was my means of approach to the wealthy men\r\nand women—and particularly the latter—upon whom I specialized. He is a\r\nuniversity man, and has lived among people of wealth and refinement much\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\n“He has brains, but lacks the quality of ruthlessness so important in\r\nreally successful commercial crime. He is utterly selfish, I believe,\r\nbut certain necessary factors in his profession are revolting to him—and\r\nhe has never made the effort to put down this weakness. Physically he\r\nis prepossessing: an inch or two over six feet in height, blue eyes,\r\nlight brown hair, splendid carriage; and possessed of the manners of a\r\nChesterfield.”\r\n\r\nA thin, faint voice came through the door, upon which the tattoo had\r\nmomentarily ceased:\r\n\r\n“We’ve got you, Count! Open that door, or we’ll gouge your eyes out when\r\nwe break in!”\r\n\r\nAh Wing waved his hand affably toward the source of this ominous promise.\r\n\r\n“And our friend out there?” said he. “Is he one of those whom you have\r\ndescribed?”\r\n\r\n“I was just coming to him,” replied Colonel Knight, raising a shaking\r\nhand to his forehead and mopping off the beaded perspiration. “That is\r\n‘Billy the Strangler,’ and I think the ‘Kid’ is with him. Those were my\r\nApaches—my gun men—my killers. They are much alike. Both have cunning of\r\na low order; and persistence—they are like bloodhounds, once they are put\r\non the trail.\r\n\r\n“They have been Monte’s most useful tools in his pursuit of me. But both\r\nare superstitious, and their native bloodthirstiness has grown on them\r\ntill they are little better than homicidal maniacs. The Strangler is tall\r\nand slim, with high cheek bones and lean arms which seem to be threaded\r\nwith steel wires. The Kid is of medium height, with grey eyes and sandy\r\nhair.”\r\n\r\nThe assault on the door had again been discontinued. Suddenly there\r\ncame from directly overhead a sound of splintering boards, accompanied\r\nby a rain of dust and bits of plaster. Knight sprang up and retreated,\r\nsnarling, toward a corner of the empty room.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I have been waiting to see if your old comrades would think of\r\nthat,” he commented. “It gives us a line on their resourcefulness.”\r\n\r\nColonel Knight regarded him with drawn lips, which exposed his yellow\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, what are we to do?” he cried. “Are you armed? You sit\r\nthere like a statue—”\r\n\r\n“Pray continue your very interesting description,” suggested Ah Wing.\r\n“There remains one of your band whom you have not described. I must know\r\nabout him—and then I will deal with this other matter!”\r\n\r\nFor an instant the thief glared into the face of the man seated across\r\nfrom him. What he read there steadied him a little, although the crash\r\nof splintering boards from above told him that the men he had such good\r\nreason to fear were meeting with less resistance in this direction than\r\nthey had encountered in their assault upon the door.\r\n\r\n“There remains but one,” he said hoarsely. “That is Louie Martin, my gem\r\nexpert. Martin is one of the best judges of diamonds and pearls in the\r\nworld. He is an expert in recutting and remounting stolen jewelry. And\r\nhe has a wide acquaintance among the crooked dealers of this country and\r\nEurope—”\r\n\r\nAn extensive area of plaster broke away suddenly and crashed down,\r\ntumbling about the heads and shoulders of the two occupants of the room.\r\nAt the same instant the end of a heavy gas-pipe crashed through the\r\nlaths, and the voices of the men on the floor above were raised in a\r\nshout of ferocious triumph.\r\n\r\nAh Wing stood up deliberately and looked toward the ceiling. He seemed\r\nto be measuring the progress of the men opposed to him. Then, without\r\nhurrying he crossed the room toward a dimly lighted corner, where he\r\nstooped and opened a small door in the wall. This door was built in\r\nsegments, like that of a safe; and was hinged with metal plates of\r\nenormous strength.\r\n\r\nColonel Knight, who cowered directly behind the Chinaman, felt a breath\r\nof cool, moist air, smelling strongly of earthy decay, blowing up from\r\nthis diminutive doorway.\r\n\r\n“Kindly precede me, Colonel,” commanded Ah Wing. “Watch your step—the\r\ngoing is rather precipitous!”\r\n\r\nKnight stooped and made his way through the opening. He found himself on\r\na stairway which went steeply down into utter darkness.\r\n\r\nA cloud of white dust filtered up into the light of the electric bulb;\r\nand, as Ah Wing stood watching, a lithe human figure landed with a crash\r\non top of the heap of plaster and splintered boards and laths.\r\n\r\nIn the same instant the Chinaman passed silently through the small\r\ndoorway, and his companion heard him slipping the bolts into place.\r\n\r\nThe darkness which had suddenly clutched them was so intense that it\r\nseemed to have physical substance. A squeaking sound from above brought\r\nKnight’s face swiftly up. Something cold and reptilian flapped into his\r\neyes and, with another _squeak_, was gone.\r\n\r\n“Only a bat!” said Ah Wing softly. “Rest your hand on my shoulder and\r\nfeel your way a step at a time. I will turn on my flashlight!”\r\n\r\nA conical beam of light drilled through the darkness below them, and Ah\r\nWing’s companion saw that they were descending a narrow flight of stone\r\nsteps that seemed to terminate in a panel of utter blackness. The walls\r\non each side were damp; and pallid fungi had taken the place of the\r\nmildew of the cellars above.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, where are we?” the white man demanded through chattering\r\nteeth. “This looks like the shaft of a mine!”\r\n\r\n“This is part of the underground system which made Chinatown famous,\r\nbefore the disaster of 1906,” replied the Oriental. “Few white men have\r\never been down here—particularly of late years!”\r\n\r\nHe paused. They had reached a narrow landing, from which passages\r\nbranched in half a dozen directions. Another descending stairway yawned\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n“If I were to leave you here,” smiled Ah Wing, “you would never find\r\nyour way out! You could not go back the way you have come, for there are\r\nacute-angled branches which would confuse you. Most of them end in masses\r\nof rubbish, easily dislodged by the unwary! But with me you are safe!”\r\n\r\nHis voice had an ominous softness. Knight followed down along the second\r\nflight of stairs. His heart was pounding. Suppose these crumbling walls\r\nshould collapse! Suppose this unearthly being, in whose hands his safety\r\nlay, decided to rob him!\r\n\r\nAh Wing spoke abruptly:\r\n\r\n“We have been following down the face of a hill. Now we reach the level,\r\nand here we leave these catacombs!”\r\n\r\nHe turned sharply to the left and led the way along a short passage which\r\nterminated in a second diminutive door. Ah Wing shot back the bolts and\r\nmotioned for his companion to proceed him into the room beyond.\r\n\r\nKnight obeyed. Daylight was there—white, blazing daylight! He blinked as\r\nhe crept through the opening.\r\n\r\nNext moment he tried to cry out. An arm had passed in front of his body,\r\npinioning him. In the same instant a sinewy hand came close to his face,\r\nand there was a little tinkle of broken glass—a diminutive globule had\r\nbeen broken under his nose.\r\n\r\nThe thief struggled to turn his head aside, fought to keep from breathing\r\nin the stupefying fumes; but with a smothering gasp he surrendered.\r\n\r\nHe breathed deeply, and as he did so a sudden feeling of lightness and\r\nof expansion came upon him. In the act of wondering stupidly what this\r\nsubstance was that the Chinaman had forced upon him, his mind went blank.\r\n\r\nAh Wing continued for a moment to hold his hand over the mouth and\r\nnostrils of his victim. Then he carried Knight across the room and laid\r\nhim on a divan. Turning deliberately, he pressed an electric button.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the brooding silence of the building, beyond this room, a\r\ndeep throated bell rang clamorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER THREE_\r\n\r\nTHE EVENING WOLVES\r\n\r\nHigh in an apartment house, overlooking a street and something of the\r\ncity, Monte Jerome, leader of the Evening Wolves, sat at his ease, a\r\ncigarette in the corner of his thin, merciless mouth, a telephone within\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nFrom the back rooms of the apartment came the sound of heavy breathing,\r\nintermingled with an energetic and unmusical snore. Louie Martin, gem\r\nexpert for the gang, and “Doc,” their society specialist, were sleeping.\r\n\r\nMonte listened critically to the heavy breathing. He was an expert in\r\nsuch matters, and his seasoned judgment told him that neither of his\r\ncomrades was faking sleep.\r\n\r\nWith a nod of satisfaction, he stood up and walked soundlessly into the\r\ncorridor connecting the rooms, stopping first in that occupied by “Doc,”\r\nand then in the back room where Louie Martin was sleeping. In each room\r\nhe paused long enough to make a thorough search of the clothing of the\r\nsleeping robber.\r\n\r\nMonte went expeditiously through all the pockets, and even examined\r\nthe linings. Just a little exhibition of the honor that obtains among\r\nthieves: Monte Jerome knew that his leadership depended on his ability to\r\ncommand his companions’ unwilling respect, and he was taking no chances.\r\n\r\n“I got a hunch Doc is thinking of ditching the gang, and going it for\r\nhimself,” Monte murmured as he returned toward the front room. “If he\r\nthinks—”\r\n\r\nThe ’phone bell rang suddenly, and the man on duty crossed to the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” he said.... “Oh, hello, Billy.... What’s that—Hell’s bells! Got\r\naway! Get busy and find him—”\r\n\r\nThe voice of the Strangler came to him over the wire.\r\n\r\n“Keep your shirt on, Chief!” it commanded. “You better come down here\r\nand see for yourself what we was up against!”\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Monte was shaking Louie Martin awake.\r\n\r\n“Come to life!” Monte grated. “The Count has made his getaway! You get\r\ninto your clothes and tend ’phone! This is one hell of a mess!”\r\n\r\nMartin climbed sluggishly and unwillingly out of bed.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been running things,” he snarled. “If you’ve got ’em in a mess,\r\nit’s no one’s fault but your own!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt a corner on the outskirts of Chinatown, Monte alighted from his taxi.\r\nThis was a special machine, owned and operated by a crook who dealt\r\nindiscriminately in transportation, dope and bootleg whisky.\r\n\r\nMonte commanded this worthy citizen to await his return, and plunged into\r\na labyrinth of narrow streets and alleys.\r\n\r\nA shrill whistle sounded presently, and he saw the Strangler beckoning\r\nhim from a doorway. Crossing over, Monte followed his henchman into an\r\nalley, down a flight of narrow stairs, and into an unlighted basement.\r\nHere they were joined by the “Kid,” who carried an electric torch.\r\n\r\n“Come on, Chief,” the “Kid” commanded. “We’ll show you first what we was\r\nup against—watch your step! If you stub your toe you’ll land in hell!”\r\n\r\nThey turned and went down another stairway, narrower and steeper than\r\nthe first. At the bottom their way was barred by a heavy door, studded\r\nwith great iron bolts. In one place the wood had been battered away,\r\ndisclosing the gleaming surface of a steel panel.\r\n\r\n“We followed the Count here, and thought we had him cornered,” the “Kid”\r\ndrawled, rolling his cigarette from one corner of his mouth to the other\r\nand regarding Monte through lazy, sardonic eyes. “When we saw we couldn’t\r\nget through this way, we went up to the floor above and come at him\r\nthrough the ceiling. Come along—we’ll show you!”\r\n\r\nThey went back up one flight of stairs and entered a room which evidently\r\nhad long been unused. Its walls were crumbling, and in the middle a great\r\nhole had been torn in the floor. The Strangler, who was leading the way,\r\ncrossed over to this opening and unhesitatingly disappeared through it.\r\nNext moment a yellow light filtered up through the opening.\r\n\r\n“Down you go, Chief,” commanded the “Kid.” “This was the door we made!”\r\n\r\nMonte made his way down through the opening, landing on the upper of\r\ntwo chairs which had been piled precariously together to assist in\r\nthe descent. He was followed by the “Kid,” and the three crooks stood\r\nexamining the room in which Ah Wing and Colonel Knight had held their\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nMonte spoke with a snarl.\r\n\r\n“All right, you two!” he cried, “Here is where he was! Where is he now?\r\nCome across with your alibi!”\r\n\r\nHis two companions exchanged significant glances and the “Kid” took a\r\nslouching step closer to Monte.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Chief,” said he, “it ain’t gonna be healthy for you to\r\ntalk that way to me! I’m not spielin’ no alibi. What I’m givin’ you is\r\nstraight goods, and you better get that twist out of your mush and act\r\nlike a gentleman!”\r\n\r\nHe paused; and his two crumpled ears, which spoke of vicissitudes in the\r\nprize ring, grew red as a rooster’s comb. His glassy gray eyes glared\r\nunblinkingly at Monte.\r\n\r\nThe latter was not afraid of either of these men, or of both of them\r\ntogether. Monte had the unflinching courage of the perfect animal. But he\r\nhad no notion of breaking up a gang which might prove useful to him.\r\n\r\n“All right, boys,” he agreed, more pacifically, although his dark eyes\r\ncontinued to glow like coals. “If you can afford to take it easy, you got\r\nnothing on me! Tell me what happened.”\r\n\r\n“That’s more like it,” the “Kid” growled. “Now you’re talking like a\r\ngentleman, Chief! Well, we follows the Count here, and thinks we has him\r\nholed up. We can’t bust down that door—this is an old Chink gambling\r\nhell, and everything is stacked against a fellow that wants to get in.\r\nBut we comes down through the roof—”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the “Kid” paused. From somewhere behind there had come a sound\r\nas of the opening of a door. The eyes of his two companions followed his\r\nand together they stood, rigid and alert.\r\n\r\nSlowly the back wall of the room opened out toward them. Unconsciously,\r\nthe crooks shrank closer together. Their faces were drawn, their figures\r\nrigid.\r\n\r\nThe panel swung fully open, and a figure appeared in it. It was the form\r\nof a tall man, clad in black silk.\r\n\r\nThe three crooks stood staring at him silently. So unexpected had been\r\nhis appearance that it had affected them with a sort of paralysis. Their\r\nmouths gaped open and their eyes bulged.\r\n\r\nSerenely, the intruder stood looking down upon them; and then, with a\r\ncourteous wave of his hand, he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Pardon my intrusion, gentlemen!” said he. “My little affairs can wait—I\r\nwill return later!”\r\n\r\nHe turned, and next moment the panel had swung silently shut behind him.\r\n\r\nMonte Jerome was the first of the three to recover.\r\n\r\n“Come on—we’ve got to get him!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“That was the Chink we saw spieling with the Count,” the “Kid” cried\r\nhoarsely. “But, for the love of cripe, how did he get here?”\r\n\r\nMonte snarled wolfishly:\r\n\r\n“Ask _him_ that! We’ve got to bust through here—”\r\n\r\nHis compact body landed against the panel. It shook, but refused to yield.\r\n\r\n“Come back here! Now, all together!” bellowed Monte.\r\n\r\nThe three leaped forward and struck the partition.\r\n\r\nThis time it swung inward, slowly and without a sound. The crooks leaped\r\nthrough the opening, and the “Kid” flashed his torch. They were standing\r\njust inside a vast, windowless room, at whose farther side they had a\r\nglimpse of sagging timbers and ruined walls. Nowhere was there a sign of\r\nthe man who had eluded them.\r\n\r\n“Get a move on!” Monte growled throatily. His lip drew up and he snarled\r\nat his companions. “A hell of a bunch of crooks, we are! Why didn’t you\r\ntake a shot at him, when you saw he was going to make a getaway?”\r\n\r\nThe “Kid” glared back.\r\n\r\n“Cut out that kind of talk, Chief! You got a gat, and two hands! He\r\nbuffaloed you just like he did us! Be a sport and take your medicine!”\r\n\r\nA determined search of the ruined chamber yielded no results. The “Kid”\r\ndropped to his stomach and wormed his way under the mass of timbers at\r\nthe farther side. He found the beginning of a stone-lined tunnel, which\r\ndipped abruptly into the earth.\r\n\r\nDamp, mouldy air fanned his cheeks; and as he crouched, motionless,\r\nlistening, a distant reverberation came to him from the bowels of the\r\nearth. It sounded like the clanking of a great iron door.\r\n\r\n“Let me out of this!” he growled, as he backed toward his companions. “We\r\ngot a fat chance of following that yellow devil into his hole. You go, if\r\nyou want to!”\r\n\r\nMonte shook his head. He had regained his poise, and he had been thinking.\r\n\r\n“No use trying to follow,” he admitted. “We got to comb Chinatown for the\r\ntwo of them. They can’t live down in that burrow forever. But why did\r\nthis duck show himself? He must have known we were here—he could hear us\r\ntalking!”\r\n\r\nThe “Kid” smiled craftily.\r\n\r\n“Maybe him and the Count left something,” he suggested. “We better have a\r\nlook!”\r\n\r\n“No, they didn’t leave nothing. I would have seen it if they had. I got\r\nan idea the Chink _wanted us to see him_! He stood there with his face\r\nturned into the light. Well, we got to find him! That’s flat!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER FOUR_\r\n\r\nTHE MAN IN THE LIGHTED ROOM\r\n\r\nThe wolves shifted their quarters that night to a rooming-house on the\r\nedge of Chinatown, and the search for Colonel Knight and his mysterious\r\ncompanion, the tall Chinaman, began.\r\n\r\nFor three days they worked feverishly. Monte Jerome seemed never to\r\nsleep, and his temper was not at all improved by the ordeal. He drove his\r\ncompanions fiercely, and only the fact that they were playing for big\r\nstakes prevented open rebellion.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day Monte and the “Kid,” who were loitering, alert but\r\nalmost hopeless, in the entrance to a building in one of the narrow\r\nstreets of the Oriental quarter, caught sight of a figure disappearing\r\nthrough a doorway. It was a tall figure, partly concealed by a light\r\novercoat; but both of them leaped forward at the same instant.\r\n\r\n“That was the Chink, sure as God made little red apples!” the “Kid”\r\nsnapped.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the street. Several automobiles were drawn up close to the\r\ncurb, among them a big blue limousine from which the Chinaman had stepped\r\na moment before they identified him. Monte approached a well-dressed\r\ngentleman, who had just come out of the building, and asked him what was\r\ngoing on inside.\r\n\r\n“This is the fall exhibition of the Iconoclasts,” the stranger explained\r\ngood-naturedly.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be sizing up the two crooks.\r\n\r\n“I think you boys would enjoy it,” he added mischievously. “The admission\r\nis only fifty cents.”\r\n\r\nMonte and the “Kid” bought tickets, and presently they entered a big\r\nroom with a high ceiling, upon whose walls were hung a number of gaudy\r\npaintings. The newcomers stared round at the fifty or more spectators who\r\nwere making the rounds of the gallery.\r\n\r\n“Hell!” growled the “Kid,” “this ain’t no place for an honest strongarm\r\nman—Let’s beat it and send for Doc!”\r\n\r\nMonte gripped his arm.\r\n\r\n“Look!” he said under his breath. “Over there near the corner!”\r\n\r\nThe “Kid” looked stealthily as directed, and perceived the tall man in\r\nthe gray topcoat. He was standing with his back to them, examining a red\r\nand yellow daub that looked like an omelette liberally seasoned with\r\npaprika.\r\n\r\n“That’s him!” Monte whispered. “All right, Kid! You have Mike bring the\r\ncab down to the corner where we was waiting. Then, when this duck beats\r\nit out of here, I’ll hop in and we’ll follow him!”\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the tall man in the gray coat—who in American\r\ngarb looked more like an Oriental than he had when dressed as a\r\nChinaman—paused to look deliberately at his watch, and then turned to the\r\nouter door.\r\n\r\nBy the time he stepped into the blue limousine, Monte had reached the\r\ncorner and was climbing in beside the driver of the taxi. The “Kid” had\r\nthe window down, and was kneeling with his head close to the driver’s.\r\n\r\n“How ’bout it, Mike!” Monte demanded. “Can you keep ’em in sight?”\r\n\r\n“Watch me!” snorted the driver. “There ain’t no Chink going can leave me\r\nbehind. Did you see that chauffeur? Got a face like a monkey!”\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty, for the present, in keeping the blue limousine\r\nin sight, however. It went sedately down a side street and took the turn\r\ntoward the ferry. Five minutes later Monte and the Kid saw the cab in\r\nwhich they were seated draw in behind the larger car, and roll over the\r\nlanding platform. The limousine was stationed on the right, and the cab\r\non the left, of the big boat.\r\n\r\nMonte scrambled down, and with a curt command to the other two made his\r\nway around to where he could see the enclosed car. The man in the gray\r\novercoat was sealed inside, with a coffee-brown Chinaman in livery at the\r\nwheel. Monte kept them in sight till the ferry was approaching the slip.\r\nThen he hurried back and climbed in again beside the driver.\r\n\r\n“Here’s where they’ll try to leave us behind, if they have any idea we’re\r\nfollowing!” he predicted.\r\n\r\n“Let ’em,” growled Mike. “If we don’t get took in by a speed cop, I won’t\r\nnever let no Chink drive away from me! You boys just hang onto your\r\nbonnets, and watch us!”\r\n\r\nThe big blue car seemed to have accepted this challenge. The little man\r\nat the wheel swung out and passed half a dozen slower machines, then took\r\nthe center of the road and held it.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of evening, a powdery fog swooped down over the ridges to\r\nthe west, and suddenly the tail lights of the limousine shot up in the\r\ngloom ahead. Notch by notch, the Chinese chauffeur was adding to his\r\nspeed. The lighter car behind bounced and swayed, and Mike spat through\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\n“Say, that bird must be clear nuts!” he growled. “If we get took in,\r\nthey’ll sentence us to about five life-times! What say, gents? Want to\r\nlet him go?”\r\n\r\n“You keep going!” snarled Monte, staring hardeyed into the fog. “If we\r\nget pinched, I pay for it, see? But don’t you let that bird get away, if\r\nyou want to sleep in your little bed tonight!”\r\n\r\nMike glanced sideways at the man whose elbow touched his. Something\r\nhe saw in the stony face of Monte Jerome caused him to turn all his\r\nattention to the task in hand.\r\n\r\nThe tail lights had been growing dim, but now, slowly, the cab began to\r\ngain. Other cars, headed for the ferry, shot out of the fog and into it,\r\nhonking warning horns at the crazily lurching machine that burned the\r\nroad in pursuit of the blue limousine. The stony faces of the three men\r\nin the cab never deviated from their straight glare into the gloom ahead.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the big car was slackening. The driver of the cab grinned\r\nwryly.\r\n\r\n“He knows the ropes. Speed cop in this burg ahead lies awake nights\r\nthinking up new ways of raising hell for speedy drivers,” he explained.\r\n“Now we’ll creep up on ’em a little more!”\r\n\r\nThey passed through the little town and again were in the open country.\r\nThe limousine continued its more leisurely progress, however, and\r\npresently turned to the right into a dirt road. The cab dropped farther\r\nbehind, at Monte’s command.\r\n\r\n“They can’t get away from us on this road. Probably aren’t going far, and\r\nwe don’t want them to spot us. Take it easy!”\r\n\r\nThe road seemed to be leading gently down, and presently they caught the\r\ngleam of water on each side. Rushes grew up close to the track; and from\r\nsomewhere in the dusk the cry of a gull sounded like the wailing of a\r\nlost soul.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily, the “Kid” shivered.\r\n\r\n“Hell of a country!” he mumbled. “Where you reckon he’s headed for?”\r\n\r\n“Wait and see!” snapped Monte. “Hello!—he’s turning in! That must be a\r\nprivate road! Stop here!”\r\n\r\nHe slid from the seat and stood swinging his feet alternately, to restore\r\nthe circulation in them. Then he jerked his head into the darkness.\r\n\r\n“Come on, Kid! We got to see what he’s up to!”\r\n\r\nThe “Kid” clambered out, and the two crooks struck silently up the road.\r\nThey reached the turn and found, as they had guessed, that they were at\r\nthe entrance to a private road.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, the two men paused and stared in through the trees. Night\r\npressed thick and damp about them. A wind from the southeast brought to\r\nthem the smell of the marshes, and once the booming whistle of a steamer\r\nsounded. In a lull of the wind, the gulls were screaming.\r\n\r\n“This ain’t in my line, Chief!” snarled the “Kid,” glaring into the\r\ndarkness. “I can bump a guy off under the city lights as nifty as the\r\nnext one, but this nature stuff never did set right on my stomach. Let’s\r\ngo back!”\r\n\r\n“You go back if you want to!” Monte said menacingly. “But if you do,\r\ndon’t come sniveling around me later on. I’m going in there!”\r\n\r\nHe struck off along the winding road, and in a moment the “Kid” fell into\r\nstep at his side.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, the two advanced till suddenly the lights of a building\r\nshone upon them. They paused for a moment, then began to creep nearer,\r\nkeeping in the shelter of clumps of bushes. In this way they came close\r\nenough to discern the outlines of a large and well-built house, with a\r\nbroad frontage and two wings extending from the rear.\r\n\r\n“For the love of cripe!” whispered the “Kid,” “would you look at them\r\nwindows! Barred, every damn one of them!”\r\n\r\nMonte nodded.\r\n\r\n“Looks like a private foolish house to me,” he replied in the same\r\ncautious tone. “Come on—we’ll get around behind and see what we can make\r\nout!”\r\n\r\nThe musty darkness of the night, which had settled down around them, was\r\nnow an advantage, as it made it easier for the two Wolves to get close\r\nto the house without being seen. They crept past the massive front, with\r\nits broad steps and wide porch, and continued till they came opposite the\r\nwest wing. Most of the windows in this wing were dark, but toward the\r\nback they saw several lighted panels.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” commanded Monte. “I hope that Chink doesn’t keep a dog, but\r\nplug him if one comes at you!”\r\n\r\nOn they crept till they were close to the windows. Massive and sinister\r\nagainst the light, stood the iron bars which had first caught their\r\nattention. They crept closer, and finally Monte hauled himself up into a\r\ngnarly pepper tree whose lacy branches almost touched the nearest of the\r\nlighted windows.\r\n\r\nNext moment he reached down and grasped his companion’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Come up here!” he grated, speaking half aloud in his excitement. “Don’t\r\nslip—catch that limb! There you are!”\r\n\r\nHe assisted the “Kid” to a foothold beside himself, and together they\r\nstared through the foliage and into the lighted room beyond.\r\n\r\nThe curtains were drawn aside and the shade rolled up. Seated in full\r\nview of the two crooks was the man they had been following for five\r\nyears. He wore a dressing-gown, and beside his easy chair was a low table\r\non which rested a leather covered box.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he turned, raised the cover of the box—and Monte and the “Kid”\r\nheld their breath and stared hungrily. The light was caught and split up\r\ninto a cascade of vivid colors. The man in the dressing-gown seemed to\r\nhave in his clutching hands a fountain of fire.\r\n\r\n“The Resurrection Pendant!” snarled the “Kid,” reaching for his pistol.\r\n“Damn him!”\r\n\r\nMonte gripped his companion by the wrist.\r\n\r\n“None of that, you fool!” he hissed. “We’ve got to play safe—but the\r\nCount is caught in a trap! That Chink must have kidnapped him!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER FIVE_\r\n\r\nONE OF AH WING’S DOOR KEEPERS\r\n\r\nColonel Knight awoke and lay staring at the ceiling. It seemed a\r\nsurprisingly long distance from him—and then his glance narrowed.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head, and suddenly sat up in bed. He had just remembered\r\nthe events preceding his loss of consciousness.\r\n\r\nPonderingly, he examined his surroundings. He was in a big room, with\r\na high ceiling. There were two windows at his right and one straight\r\nahead, the latter partly open. Several easy chairs, a handsome mahogany\r\nhouse desk, and a row of bookcases flanking a fireplace came to him as\r\nsuccessive details of his environment. A bar of yellow sunlight streamed\r\nthrough the end window.\r\n\r\nA door behind him opened, and he turned to see a grinning, brown-faced\r\nChinese boy approaching his bedside, bearing a breakfast tray.\r\n\r\n“Ah Wing say he coming to see you by-m-by,” the newcomer commented\r\nplacidly. “You hab breakfast now.”\r\n\r\nHe drew up a table and placed the tray in position, then skillfully\r\narranged napkin and silverware—which were of the best quality—convenient\r\nto Colonel Knight’s hand. Afterward he withdrew.\r\n\r\nKnight’s head felt clear enough, but, mentally and physically, he was\r\nrelaxed to the point of incoherence. He wanted to think, but couldn’t.\r\n\r\nMechanically, he lifted to his lips the cup of steaming coffee that the\r\nservant had poured for him. The taste of the hot, bitter fluid—he drank\r\nit without cream or sugar—helped him pull himself together. He remembered\r\neverything now: his visit to the mysterious Chinaman; the coming of his\r\nenemies, and their attack on the basement room; his flight with Ah Wing;\r\nand the latter’s ruse for bringing Knight fully within his power.\r\n\r\nSharply he turned his head and looked again at the end window; it was\r\nbarred with heavy iron rods, and so were the two windows at the side.\r\nThis room in which he lay was a luxurious prison!\r\n\r\nThe door opened again, softly, and Colonel Knight turned his head to find\r\nAh Wing advancing toward him, dressed in white flannel trousers, silk\r\nshirt, and serge coat. In such a rig the newcomer looked every inch a\r\nChinaman.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Colonel,” Ah Wing greeted his guest courteously. “I am\r\nglad to see you looking so fresh and rested this morning!”\r\n\r\nKnight began to tremble.\r\n\r\n“You yellow crook!” he croaked, his hands drawing up into knots. “So that\r\nwas your scheme—to rob me, and then kidnap me? But don’t think you can\r\nget away with it—”\r\n\r\nAh Wing approached the bed and deftly reached under the nearer of the two\r\npillows. From this place of concealment he drew two things: the morocco\r\njewel case, and a revolver that Knight remembered having carried in his\r\ninside coat pocket.\r\n\r\n“Here are the principle articles of your property, Colonel Knight,” said\r\nthe master of the house. “The other things you will find after you are\r\ndressed.”\r\n\r\nHe paused to watch the man in the bed open the leather box and stare\r\nhungrily at the flashing jewels. Then he continued.\r\n\r\n“There was an ordeal ahead of you, my friend, and you were in no\r\ncondition to go through with it. You needed rest, but your nerves were\r\nscrewed up to the snapping point. There was only one way to get you\r\nsafely out of the city, and I used it.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that the Wolves don’t know where I am?” Knight demanded.\r\n\r\n“Not yet. I shall remedy that presently.”\r\n\r\nColonel Knight’s voice rose into a snarl:\r\n\r\n“Remedy it? You mean you want them to know?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I want them to know. I want them here, where I can deal with\r\nthem. But never fear, my friend. Your old enemies will never be able to\r\nhurt you!”\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked around the apartment, then turned again to the man\r\nin the bed.\r\n\r\n“These are your quarters. Adjoining your bedroom is the bath. This door\r\nopens into your sitting-room, and adjoining that is my conservatory,\r\nwhich you are at liberty to visit when you choose. There are no\r\nconditions placed upon your residence here except that you are not to try\r\nto leave the house without my permission—_and you are to leave the end\r\nwindow exactly as it is_. Don’t even lay your hand upon it, or upon the\r\nsill! This is important!”\r\n\r\nKnight stared again at the single end window through which the sun was\r\nshining. He stared from it to the face of the strange being who continued\r\nto regard him with the impersonal interest of a Buddha. A sense of\r\nbaffled curiosity arose within him, and he made a nervous, protesting\r\nmovement with one of his puffy hands.\r\n\r\n“Who the devil _are_ you, anyway?” he broke out. “Ah Wing! That doesn’t\r\nmean anything to me—as well say ‘Mr. X!’ You are not a Chinaman. What and\r\nwho are you?”\r\n\r\nAh Wing continued to stare imperturbably down at his guest, but the ghost\r\nof a smile showed at the corners of his usually expressionless mouth.\r\n\r\n“No,” he agreed, “I am not a Chinaman. And I am not a Caucasian. You see\r\nthat, dressed as I am today, I look unmistakably Oriental. Dressed like a\r\nman of Hong Kong, on the other hand, I look American or English. That has\r\nbeen my curse, and perhaps my blessing: the mixing of two irreconcilable\r\nblood lines has made me an outcast. I have no place in the government of\r\nany country, and therefore I have organized a government of my own.\r\n\r\n“I am the emperor, the president, the king, of an invisible empire. I\r\nrule by right of intellect and will, and my first failure will be my\r\ndeath warrant; for, judged even by the standards of a thief like you,\r\nColonel Knight, I am an outlaw—one who is outside the protection of the\r\nlaws of men!”\r\n\r\nHe laughed, a short, mirthless laugh. As he crossed toward the door he\r\nsaid over his shoulder, “Remember about the window. I shall be going out\r\nfrom time to time, but if you carry out my instructions to the letter, no\r\nharm can come to you even in this house of hidden dangers.”\r\n\r\nTry as he would, Colonel Knight could find nothing wrong with his\r\nsituation as it had been outlined to him by Ah Wing. He spent most of\r\nthe first day in the room in which he had awakened. From the windows in\r\none direction he could see a landscaped lawn and hillside, dotted with\r\nshrubbery and intersected by winding gravel paths.\r\n\r\nFrom the rear window concerning which he had been so curiously warned\r\nby the master of the house, he looked out over a bit of lawn bordering\r\na kitchen garden. Beyond the garden lay a marshy field, and in the\r\ndistance he made out a canal along which an occasional motor boat chugged\r\nindustriously. No, there was nothing wrong here—he could hardly have\r\nhoped for a more peaceful place in which to rest and grow strong.\r\n\r\nBut—there was an air of brooding watchfulness over the silent house. He\r\nheard an occasional padded footstep passing the door of his sitting-room.\r\nOnce he looked out. At the farther side of an extensive conservatory the\r\nbrown-faced servant who had brought him his breakfast was spraying some\r\nsnaky-looking vines bearing huge orange-colored flowers. Colonel Knight\r\nclosed the door. Something about the place—the quiet and the isolation,\r\nperhaps, were getting on his nerves.\r\n\r\nThe second day passed as the first, but toward noon of the third day Ah\r\nWing knocked at his door and entered noiselessly. He was dressed in his\r\nOriental garb, and again looked like a poorly-disguised white man.\r\n\r\n“I will be going out for a few hours this afternoon, Colonel,” he\r\nexplained, regarding the man before him with his habitual unwinking\r\nstare. “I am taking Lim with me, and I think it will be best for you to\r\nremain in your quarters.”\r\n\r\nAlthough his words had taken the form of a request, there was back of\r\nthem the force of a command. The white man eyed him suspiciously, but\r\npresently nodded.\r\n\r\nSome time later he heard the _whir_ of a starting motor. Lim had brought\r\nhim his luncheon, and now Knight figured the house would be deserted. He\r\nsmiled. This would be his opportunity to look around a bit. The instincts\r\nof the crook were strong within him, and he was immensely curious with\r\nregard to the house of Ah Wing.\r\n\r\nHe waited an hour after he had heard the car leave the garage—from the\r\nback window he had caught a glimpse of it: a gray roadster of moderate\r\nsize and power. Now he felt sure that he would not be interrupted.\r\n\r\nCrossing to the door of the conservatory, he passed into it. Along one\r\nside were orchids, Colonel Knight realized vaguely that the collection\r\nmust be priceless. Many of them were growing in diminutive glass rooms,\r\nupon whose walls he saw heavy drops of moisture.\r\n\r\nOne pale green blossom near him had weird markings in white and yellow,\r\nwhich gave it a disturbing resemblance to a grinning human face. The\r\nman thrust out a curious finger and touched it: the blossom drew itself\r\ntogether like a conscious thing, and he became aware of a sickening\r\nperfume which in an instant turned him dizzy.\r\n\r\nHe shrank back and continued his journey. The concrete floor narrowed,\r\nand at his left he saw a lily pond, upon whose surface great white\r\nblossoms showed their buttery yellow centers. Between the pads and\r\nblossoms of the lilies the water showed, deep and dark.\r\n\r\nColonel Knight leaned forward to peer into the pool; then, with a choking\r\ncry he staggered back, his face drained of blood: an ugly black snout had\r\nshot up out of the murky depths, and a huge lizard, with short, powerful\r\nforelegs armed with long claws, stared hungrily up at him.\r\n\r\nHe found his appetite for exploration losing its edge. He was tempted\r\nto turn back, but he wanted to settle one point: in case he should want\r\nto leave this house, how could he best do it? The windows were securely\r\nbarred, but there must be plenty of doors.\r\n\r\nA hall opened out from the conservatory, and on either side were rooms,\r\nvariously furnished. He hurried on. Ahead, he saw a door which seemed\r\nto give upon the outer world. He grasped the knob. The door was locked,\r\nand the lock was one which a glance told him could be neither picked nor\r\nsmashed.\r\n\r\nTurning, he explored the rear of the house. In the east wing he found the\r\nkitchens and servants’ quarters, but a door which probably communicated\r\nwith the kitchen gardens was locked.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his wandering eyes caught the handle of a door in an angle\r\nof the pantry. He approached it and found that it opened upon a stair\r\nleading down. A gust of warm, damp air came up through the stairway, and\r\nfor a moment Knight paused, sniffing curiously.\r\n\r\nHe found himself thinking of a certain sultry afternoon in India, when\r\nhe had gone out into the simmering jungle. There was the same wild smell\r\nhere—\r\n\r\nHe had his revolver in his hip pocket. That gave him confidence, and he\r\nmust know if it would be possible for him to escape in this direction.\r\n\r\nA phrase spoken by Ah Wing came to him—“Even in this house of hidden\r\ndangers!” But what dangers could there be?\r\n\r\nColonel Knight felt his way down into the basement. He found that it lay\r\nalmost entirely below the level of the grounds, but presently his eyes\r\nbecame accustomed to the dusk and he could discern his surroundings.\r\n\r\nHe was in a broad and deep room, filled with a litter of packing cases,\r\ndiscarded articles of furniture, and a few garden tools. At its farther\r\nside was a door. Slowly and cautiously, the investigator made his way\r\ntoward this.\r\n\r\nIt opened into a dark and narrow passage. He made his way along this,\r\ntrying the handles of two locked doors, one on the right and the other on\r\nthe left. Then he came to the end of the passage and to another door.\r\n\r\nCautiously, he opened it and looked inside: before him lay a room\r\nsomewhat better lighted than the passage, but absolutely destitute of\r\nfurniture. He crossed the threshold and stood for a long moment looking\r\nabout him. The smell which he had associated with that hot afternoon in\r\nthe jungle came to him almost overpoweringly now, but beyond he saw a\r\ndoor with an iron-barred transom. He wanted to try that door.\r\n\r\nHe had crossed halfway toward it when some subtle sense of danger brought\r\nhim to a stop. He looked back. Nothing.\r\n\r\nThen, with a start, he looked up, into the dusky ceiling. Something was\r\nmoving there—he stepped back, drawing in his breath with a sharp hissing\r\nintake of terror. He backed toward the door. It was taking shape, up\r\nthere among some uncovered beams and pipes—a huge column that seemed to\r\nhave come alive! Slowly it swung down in a great curve.\r\n\r\nColonel Knight stood frozen in his tracks. It was a snake—but such a\r\nsnake! He knew that this was no waking vision, but a horrible reality—\r\n\r\nWith a choking cry, he turned and ran as he had never run before in his\r\nlife. Behind him he heard a hissing as of sand being poured from an\r\nelevation into a tin pail. A box was overturned. The thing was gaining\r\non him—he turned, and with bulging eyes he saw the python strung out\r\nalong the floor, its great body undulating, its flat head raised, its\r\nunblinking eyes burning through the dusk.\r\n\r\nHe could never make the stairs. At the left was a small door. He threw\r\nhimself upon it and clutched the handle—it came open and, without looking\r\nbefore him, he threw himself forward. Something struck against the door\r\nas he jerked it shut, and he could hear that uncanny sand blast louder\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nGroping about him in the utter darkness of this refuge, he found a metal\r\ncontrivance—a wheel, with a metal stem connecting it with a large iron\r\npipe. He was in the closet which housed the intake of the water system.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered his revolver. It would be of little use to him against\r\nthe horrible thing coiled outside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Ah Wing returned to the house, several hours later, he went quietly\r\nthrough the hall and conservatory to the door of Colonel Knight’s\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nSatisfied by a brief inspection that his “guest” was not in his rooms,\r\nthe Chinaman turned and made his way to the basement door. His face was\r\nas serene as usual, but his eyes shone with a metallic gleam. He opened\r\nthe door and for a moment stood listening.\r\n\r\nAn angry and prolonged _hiss_, which sounded like a great jet of steam,\r\ncame plainly to him. He stepped into the hallway and deliberately closed\r\nthe door behind him. Then he felt his way down the stairs, pausing within\r\na few steps of the bottom to look unwinkingly about.\r\n\r\nSomething was moving in the dim shadows at the farther side of the room.\r\nIt came slowly toward him, and he could make out the undulating length of\r\nthe python. Ah Wing’s glowing eyes rested unwaveringly on the flat, evil\r\nhead of the great snake, which came toward him more and more slowly.\r\n\r\nWith a final prolonged _hiss_, the python drew itself up into a huge\r\ncoil. It was a tremendous creature, as large as a man’s body at its\r\ngreatest diameter: but now it seemed to be turning slowly to stone. Its\r\nbeady eyes grew dull, and its swaying head became rigid.\r\n\r\nA muffled cry reached the ears of the motionless Chinaman. Without the\r\nflicker of an eyelid, he continued to stare down at the python.\r\n\r\nPresently he descended to the foot of the stairs. The snake was still.\r\n\r\nAh Wing crossed to the closet door and threw it open.\r\n\r\n“You can leave your retreat now, Colonel Knight,” he said. “My little\r\nplaymate is temporarily in a condition of catalepsy—but I would not\r\nadvise you to repeat this visit!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER SIX_\r\n\r\nLOUIE MARTIN LEARNS THE SECRET OF THE WINDOW\r\n\r\nMonte and the “Kid” went back to the city that same evening, but early\r\nnext morning the leader of the Wolves returned to the neighborhood where\r\nthey had picked up the trail of Colonel Knight.\r\n\r\nMonte had caught sight of a “For Rent” sign in the upper window of a\r\ncottage half a mile from the big house, and he wasted no time in hunting\r\nup the rental agent and signing a lease. By evening he had his men with\r\nhim, and the battle lines were established for the final conflict.\r\n\r\n“We got to get all the dope on this Chink and his layout we can,” Monte\r\nexplained to his companions, as they sat smoking in the parlor of their\r\nnew home. “We might try to rush the house, but I don’t like the looks of\r\nit. Chances are that Chink’s got a machine gun or a bunch of sawed-off\r\npump guns there. We’ll have to size things up.”\r\n\r\nHe paused to stare at his men.\r\n\r\n“Any kicks on that? All right, it’s settled. Louie, it’s your turn for\r\nsentry duty, and you better get over to the Chink’s castle now. At two\r\no’clock I’ll send Doc over to relieve you. You might take a look at the\r\nwindows, and see if any of them can be handled without a saw—there may be\r\nsome loose bars!”\r\n\r\nLouie Martin, the gem expert, was a little tallow-faced man with a\r\nstraggling, peaked beard and shifty eyes. He had no real appetite for\r\nthis sort of thing, but for personal reasons he was more willing than\r\nusual to go on duty tonight.\r\n\r\nSlipping his automatic into the holster under his arm, he struck off\r\nalong the road toward the house of Ah Wing, whose gables were visible\r\nfrom the cottage. A light wind was blowing from the southeast, and he\r\ncould see the mist rising over the marshes. Somewhere from the steamy air\r\nabove a night heron screamed raucously. Involuntarily, Louie shivered.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to turn his thoughts to his own immediate affairs. Louie\r\nMartin had made up his mind to strike out for himself. He had always\r\nadmired Colonel Knight—or “Count von Hondon”—for the shrewd stroke of\r\nbusiness he had done; and Louie was keen enough to perceive that Monte\r\nJerome was not equal to the task of holding the Wolves together. At the\r\npresent time there was open dissension among them. One of these days\r\none of them would squeal on the others—that was the way this mob stuff\r\nusually ended.\r\n\r\nNo, Louie had made up his mind to watch his chance for a crack at the\r\njewels—and then a clean getaway.\r\n\r\nHe reached the private road leading to the Chinaman’s house, paused for\r\na moment to listen and reconnoiter, then stealthily struck into the\r\ngrounds. Five minutes later he had skirted the west wing and was peering\r\nup through the shrubbery at the lighted windows of Colonel Knight’s\r\napartment. Their location had been sketched for him by Monte.\r\n\r\n“So that’s where the old devil is!” thought Louie. “Let’s just have a\r\nlook-see!”\r\n\r\nHe climbed into a pepper tree—the same from which Monte and the “Kid” had\r\nseen Knight—and stared into the room. It was lighted, but there was no\r\none in sight. Then, through a vista of open doors, he saw the man whom\r\nhe had been sent to watch, walking slowly about with his hands clasped\r\nbehind him, a cigar between his lips.\r\n\r\n“Had a good supper, and now he’s enjoying a smoke!” Louie mumbled\r\nenviously. “Well, that’s good enough for me, too! Let’s have a look at\r\nthat window!”\r\n\r\nHe slipped down from the tree and glanced about. At the corner of the\r\nhouse was a galvanized iron can, evidently used for lawn clippings. Louie\r\nlifted this cautiously and carried it over under the end window. Then he\r\nclimbed upon it, raising his head cautiously till he was standing just\r\nbeside the half-open window.\r\n\r\nA silent inspection of the bars showed him that they were all securely\r\nfastened, with one possible exception: the bottom bar seemed to be loose\r\nin its niche. Louie climbed down, changed the can over to the opposite\r\nside, and examined the opposite end. Sure enough, it showed a crumble of\r\nconcrete around the bolt which was supposed to hold it in place. With the\r\nutmost caution, fearing that the loose bar might be connected with an\r\nalarm system, the crook tested it.\r\n\r\nA smile twisted his thin lips. It could be moved in and out of its niche.\r\n\r\nA sound came from somewhere close at hand; and with the speed and silence\r\nof a wolf Louie Martin leaped to the ground, caught up the can, and\r\nreplaced it where he had found it. Next instant he was hidden in a clump\r\nof flowering shrubs.\r\n\r\nFrom this position he could see the top of a flight of steps leading down\r\nto the basement of the house of Ah Wing. He stood listening and watching,\r\nand presently he heard a door open and close, followed by steps ascending\r\nthe stairs. Then some one came up out of the basement, and he saw the\r\nfigure of a tall Chinaman walking deliberately toward the bush in which\r\nhe was hiding. Louie reached under his coat for his pistol—\r\n\r\nAh Wing turned, and Louie saw that he was following a graveled path. And\r\nhe was carrying something in one hand—a contrivance of twisted wires,\r\nlike an iron basket.\r\n\r\nAs Ah Wing disappeared into the mist, Louie made up his mind. Tonight,\r\nafter Knight had gone to bed, he would strike: he was not to be relieved\r\ntill two o’clock, and that would give him time to put through his coup.\r\nBut now he meant to follow Ah Wing. He needed all the information he\r\ncould secure about the master of this silent house.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman had disappeared into the eddying mist, but Louie struck into\r\nthe path and soon came within hearing of the crisp footsteps. Ah Wing\r\nreached the edge of the grounds and crossed over into a marshy field.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, the crook worked closer to the man he was shadowing. There\r\nwas something oddly menacing about this night, with its mist and its\r\nfitful, salt-laden wind.\r\n\r\nSuddenly through the swirling fog there appeared a light, which seemed to\r\nbe suspended ten feet or so above the ground. It was moving slowly along\r\nin front of them—a murky light, like a blood-red mist.\r\n\r\nThen Louie saw that it was the light suspended from the mast of a boat,\r\nand that the boat itself was moving slowly along before them, almost\r\nhidden by the banks of the canal. The tide must be out, he thought.\r\n\r\nAh Wing swung on through the night, and presently the man following him\r\nmade out the silhouette of a building, perched above the canal. Louie\r\nslunk cautiously forward and saw that the boat, whose lantern he had\r\npreviously observed, was making fast at that wharf.\r\n\r\nAh Wing leaped lightly to the sunken deck and disappeared down the\r\ncompanionway. Before Louie could decide what he was to do, the Chinaman\r\nreappeared and climbed back to the wharf. Louie had just time to slip\r\ninto the shelter of a group of piling when the Chinaman passed the corner\r\nof the building.\r\n\r\nAnd in his hand was another of the wire contrivances, filled with\r\nsquirming, squeaking rats!\r\n\r\nThe white man felt his stomach doing queer antics. He had heard of\r\nChinamen eating rats. Was that what this fellow was up to? What else\r\ncould he want with them?\r\n\r\nAh Wing walked swiftly, and the man behind kept as close as he dared.\r\nAgain they entered the grounds surrounding the big house, and the\r\nOriental crossed to the basement stairs and went down. Louie paused in\r\nthe bushes.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to gamble,” he whispered suddenly to himself. “I’ll just sneak\r\ndown those steps, and if he tries to come out before I can duck, I’ll\r\nbean him! I want to know what he’s up to!”\r\n\r\nStealthily, he approached the steps. All that he could see was a murky\r\nhole, into which the cement stairs disappeared. A step at a time he made\r\nhis way down—\r\n\r\nAnd then he paused, holding himself bent forward, rigid as a man of\r\nstone. From beyond the door which opened out of this pit came a strange\r\nsound, the like of which he had never before heard. It was like a jet of\r\nsteam, or like sand sifting into a tin pail from a considerable height.\r\n\r\nThen came another sound—the sing-song voice of the Chinaman, crooning\r\nsomething in a rhythmic chant. Louie could not understand the words, but\r\nthere was a swing and lilt to the thing that had a curious effect on him:\r\n_he felt as if he were being rocked to sleep_.\r\n\r\nHe threw off this mood with a start. There had come another sound—the\r\nsquealing of many rats. And there was a grating noise, as if a heavy\r\nbody were dragging itself about the floor. The rat chorus swelled. The\r\ncreatures evidently had been turned loose, and were racing about the\r\nfloor in an agony of terror.\r\n\r\nThe chorus thinned. Something was happening to them. Presently the last\r\nof the rats emitted one long, agonized squeal, and was still.\r\n\r\nLouie Martin made his way out of the cellarway and hurried dizzily back\r\nto the shelter of the bushes. He didn’t know what had been happening\r\nbehind that horrible door, but he knew that it was something which turned\r\nhis flesh to ice. A strange smell had come to him from under the door—\r\n\r\nLouie noted with relief that the lights in Colonel Knight’s rooms had\r\nbeen snapped off. That meant that the Colonel had gone to bed. Soon he\r\nwould be sleeping, and then Louie could put his plan into execution—that\r\nwould enable him to forget this baffling but vaguely horrible experience.\r\n\r\nSomehow, he felt as if great unseen creatures were flying about him,\r\nstriking at him with black, featherless wings. The air seemed to be in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nHe caught himself firmly.\r\n\r\n“Got to cut it out!” he mumbled under his breath. “Getting dippy! Likely\r\nto bite somebody! Got to think about something else!”\r\n\r\nHe began to think about the jewels; and then his mind shifted, and he\r\nwas thinking of the woman from whom he and his companions had stolen the\r\npendant. She had been called “Mother of the Friendless.” The jewels had\r\nbeen given to her by a rich patron, to assist in the work of providing\r\nfor the many who were dependent on her for charity.\r\n\r\nThe wolves had done a clever bit of work that time. They had caught the\r\njewels while they were in process of transfer from the original owner to\r\nthe old woman—\r\n\r\nAnother tangent. Louie was thinking with cold amusement of the fate of\r\nMadam Celia, the “Mother of the Friendless.” Luck had turned against\r\nher, with the loss of the jewels. Others who had helped her in her\r\nearlier years had turned away after that—as if the old woman had suffered\r\ncontamination by accepting this gift, bequeathed by a certain rather\r\nnotorious beauty whose affairs had upset thrones and dynasties.\r\n\r\nYes, a very good joke on the old woman. And she had died in abject\r\npoverty. That was the way that sort of thing went, Louie realized. One\r\nwas really a fool to do anything for anyone but one’s self.\r\n\r\nA sound came through the half-open window of Colonel Knight’s suite—and\r\nagain Louie Martin grinned. The master crook, who had stolen the jewels\r\nfrom the “Mother of the Friendless,” was now about to pass them on—only\r\nhe didn’t know it!\r\n\r\nLouie brought the metal barrel over under the window and set it, bottom\r\nup, so as to form a secure means of approach to the room beyond. He had\r\nthrown off his depression now. But he must work fast.\r\n\r\nCautiously, he stepped upon the barrel and raised his hands to the bottom\r\nbar. Twisting it slowly and at the same time pulling, he drew both bar\r\nand bolts from their sockets and tossed them to the ground. He wanted to\r\nlaugh! So this was the wisdom of a Chinaman? He might have known!\r\n\r\nThere was a stone coping a couple of feet above the top of the thing on\r\nwhich he stood. Louie rested his foot on this coping and laid his hands\r\non the sill. Lightly he drew himself up against the face of the wall.\r\n\r\nHe paused to listen. The man within was breathing heavily and regularly.\r\n\r\nLouie thrust his head through the opening—nothing in sight to alarm him.\r\nThen, with a quick spring, he threw his weight upon the sill and was\r\nhalfway through the window—\r\n\r\nHalf-way, but no farther; for as his weight descended fully upon the\r\nsill, the upper sash crashed down like the lever of a great engine. The\r\nthief cried out once, a hideous, choking cry that echoed through the room\r\nand on into the house of Ah Wing.\r\n\r\nThen he was silent, drooping there like one who has been broken on the\r\nwheel. Blood dripped from his mouth and nostrils, and he had ceased to\r\nbreathe. He was caught like a huge rat in a trap!\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER SEVEN_\r\n\r\nTHE DEAD MAN SPEAKS\r\n\r\nSomewhere beyond the mist-enshrouded marshes the whistle of a grain ship\r\nboomed, to be answered a moment later by the metallic scream of a siren.\r\nVague and mysterious filaments of sound drifted in with the eddying night\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n“Damn such a country!” the “Kid” snarled, as he turned from the door and\r\ntramped back into the house. “How long you going to keep us rusticating\r\nout here, Chief? I’m fed up on nature!”\r\n\r\nMonte Jerome scowled at his assistant.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to stay here till we get what we came for!” he replied. “If\r\nMartin doesn’t show up by morning, we got to decide what he’s up to!”\r\n\r\nAn uncanny silence gripped the four Wolves. Nearly twenty-four hours had\r\npassed since Louie Martin went on duty, and nothing had been heard from\r\nhim. An uncomfortable idea was developing in the minds of the various\r\nmembers of the “mob.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the “Kid” voiced this general suspicion. With a snarl, he\r\npointed accusingly at Monte.\r\n\r\n“Fact is, Louie ain’t coming back, Chief, and you know it! He’s grabbed\r\nsomething—maybe the sparklers—and he’s beat it. Don’t blame him a damn\r\nbit, neither. We’re going to set around here with our mouths open till\r\nthe dicks get after us. But Louie ain’t coming back, and you just put\r\nthat down in your note-book!”\r\n\r\nMonte turned toward the speaker.\r\n\r\n“Is that your opinion, you lump-head? Well, keep it till I ask you for\r\nit. The trouble with you is you’ve been thinking of cutting loose,\r\nyourself. Louie will show up all right. Don’t you worry about him.”\r\n\r\n“Hell of a lot you know about it!” mumbled the “Kid” angrily.\r\n\r\nMonte walked slowly toward him, his eyes blazing.\r\n\r\n“Trying to start something?” he demanded. “If you are—”\r\n\r\nThe Strangler intervened at this critical moment. He and the “Kid” had\r\nhad a disagreement earlier in the evening when the latter moved into\r\nthe room left vacant by Louie Martin’s unexplained absence. This was a\r\nground-floor room with an abundance of light and sun, and the “Kid,” with\r\na loose-lipped grin, announced that his doctor had told him he ought to\r\nhave it. The Strangler had protested; but the “Kid” had possession, and\r\nmade it plain that he meant to hang on.\r\n\r\nNow the Strangler sided maliciously with Monte.\r\n\r\n“You’re always belly-aching about something, Kid,” he declared. “You\r\nbetter lay off and give us a rest. The Chief knows what he is doing!”\r\n\r\nMonte paused, thankful for this opportune intervention. He had made\r\nup his mind to square account with the “Kid” just as soon as the real\r\nbusiness which held them together was finished, but a show-down now would\r\nbe dangerous to the success of the larger affair.\r\n\r\n“Let’s cut it all out, boys!” he suggested pacifically. “I’ll go on duty\r\nup to two o’clock. Doc, you set the alarm. You’ll relieve me. I’ll try to\r\nfind out something—that Chink may have grabbed Louie. We ought to know\r\nwhat has happened before we pull anything!”\r\n\r\nHe nodded to the others and left the house. The three crooks settled\r\ndown to their usual evening: the “Kid” got out a deck of cards and began\r\nto play a one-handed game of his own devising; Billy the Strangler drew\r\nhis chair over in front of the fireplace and adjusted his feet on the\r\nmantle—in this position he would smoke and stare into the coals till he\r\ngrew sleepy—and “Doc” took from the table an illustrated magazine and\r\nturned to the serial he was reading. Occasionally he glanced covertly at\r\none of his companions: “Doc” sensed the coming battle between these two\r\ngunmen, and had no intention of being caught within the firing lines.\r\n\r\nThe wind freshened, and they could hear it wailing around the house and\r\nthrough the upper windows. The window in the “Kid’s” room rattled and\r\nbanged, and he looked abstractedly up.\r\n\r\n“Hell of a night!” he mumbled. “Sounds like all the dead men in this neck\r\nof the woods was hanging around outside, wheezing to be took in by the\r\nfire! Listen to that window rattle!”\r\n\r\nThe Strangler smoked on imperturbably.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere in the house above there came a sound—low and uncertain at\r\nfirst, then rising to a sort of scream. The “Kid” threw down his cards\r\nand staggered to his feet. The Strangler hauled his long legs down from\r\nthe mantle and reached under his coat for the handle of his automatic.\r\n“Doc” turned pale—he was too sophisticated to be superstitious, but this\r\nunearthly cry was a fact rather than a theory.\r\n\r\n“What the devil was that?” the “Kid” demanded hoarsely. “Say, if that was\r\none of them birds—”\r\n\r\n“That must have been it!” “Doc” decided aloud. “A night heron, blown\r\nagainst the chimney! What a night to be out in!”\r\n\r\nHe shivered and picked up his magazine, but the zest had gone out of his\r\nreading. From the corners of his eyes he observed that the “Kid” was\r\ngathering up his cards, and that Billy had not again elevated his feet to\r\nthe mantle.\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess I’ll be going to _my_ room,” the “Kid” drawled presently,\r\nemphasizing the possessive pronoun to tantalize the Strangler. “Kind of\r\nfeel like a little snooze would take the wrinkles out of my brains. This\r\nplace sure does give me the willies!”\r\n\r\nHe slouched into the hall communicating with the back rooms—a kitchen and\r\nhis bedroom—and they heard him shuffling through the darkness. Following\r\na moment of silence, his voice sounded in a steady mumble. Then it was\r\nraised in expostulation.\r\n\r\n“Who the hell has been fooling with my light? It won’t turn on!”\r\n\r\nAnother brief interval of silence, then a bellow of rage and fear from\r\nthe man in the back bedroom.\r\n\r\n“Who’s there? Go way from me! Damn—”\r\n\r\nThey leaped up at the sound of the “Kid’s” stumbling gallop. He burst\r\ninto the room, and they saw that his face was the color of ashes.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, who’s in that room—my room?” he cried, staring at them\r\nthrough straining, glassy eyes. “Come on, you fellows! Here, I’ll take a\r\nflashlight—the globe must be burned out!”\r\n\r\nHe snatched up an electric torch and led the way back through the hall,\r\nthe Strangler at his shoulder, “Doc” some distance behind.\r\n\r\n“Someone let out a groan when I went inside the door,” the “Kid” was\r\nexplaining. “And then he says right in my ear, ‘This ain’t your room,\r\nKid!’ Listen!”\r\n\r\nThey were within five feet of the bedroom door when the “Kid” paused and\r\nheld up a trembling hand. He was directing the light of the torch upon\r\nthe doorway. And at that moment there came from it a groan, followed by a\r\nmuttered protest.\r\n\r\n“_My room!_” a voice within the room said distinctly.\r\n\r\n“Holy Mother!” whispered the Strangler. “That sounds like Louie! He must\r\nbe hurt!”\r\n\r\n“How in hell would he get in there?” protested the “Kid.” “Come on—let’s\r\nsee!”\r\n\r\nThey stepped inside the room, and the ray of the flashlight began to\r\ncircle it. Suddenly the circling beam came to a stop.\r\n\r\n“In the bed!” gasped the “Kid.” “He’s there, covered up!”\r\n\r\nSlowly and unwillingly, an inch at a time as if drawn by some\r\nirresistible force, the three Wolves crossed the room and approached the\r\nbed. They could all see the huddled form lying there, covered even to\r\nthe face. There was something about it—an utter absence of motion—that\r\nterrified them. But they could not turn back.\r\n\r\nThe “Kid” reached the bedside and for a long moment stood glaring down.\r\nThen, with shaking fingers, he caught the edge of the bedding and threw\r\nit back.\r\n\r\nIn the concentrated light of the lantern, there stared up at them the\r\nlivid face of Louie Martin. His glazed eyes protruded, and there was\r\na trickle of blood running from his nostril to the left corner of his\r\nmouth. And in his face was an expression of frozen horror which stopped\r\nthe hearts even of the hardened crooks who looked down in momentary\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\nWith a scream, the “Kid” dropped the lantern and turned, treading upon\r\nthe toes of the Strangler. Another scream sounded, high and shrill—it\r\ncame from the direction of the bed.\r\n\r\n“Why can’t you let me rest?” a quavering voice protested. “This is my\r\nroom—”\r\n\r\nThey heard no more. The three swore and sobbed as they raced for the\r\nfront room. They slammed doors behind them, and brought up, shaking as if\r\nin ague, directly under the big, brilliantly lighted chandelier.\r\n\r\n“Somebody bumped him off—and he came back to tell us about it!” the “Kid”\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER EIGHT_\r\n\r\nAH WING LISTENS IN\r\n\r\n“He’s certainly good and dead!” Monte said, as he stood looking down at\r\nthe body of Louie Martin. “Whatever they did to him, it was a plenty!\r\nBut you boys must be a little bilious—you can see for yourselves that he\r\nhasn’t been doing any talking for some time. What you heard was the wind,\r\nblowing around the corners of the house!”\r\n\r\nThe “Kid” drew the back of his hand across his glistening forehead. He\r\nwas standing near the door.\r\n\r\n“Don’t kid yourself, Chief!” he snarled. “We heard him talk—all of us\r\ndid! And there’s another thing: us being bilious wouldn’t account for\r\nLouie Martin walking in on us here, and climbing into that bed!”\r\n\r\nMonte was staring down at the dead man.\r\n\r\n“You say you heard the windows back here rattling earlier in the\r\nevening?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Sure. Why wouldn’t they? The whole house was rattling!”\r\n\r\nMonte nodded. He had his own ideas on this subject, but he didn’t intend\r\nto spread them before his already demoralized followers.\r\n\r\n“Well, the thing we’ve got to decide is what we’re going to do with him,”\r\nhe commented. “We’ve got to handle the whole business ourselves, and say\r\nnothing. We can’t afford to have the dicks asking questions around here\r\njust now!”\r\n\r\nTacitly, Monte’s three companions agreed, but there was in their pale\r\nfaces a question which none of them had the courage to voice. Monte\r\ncontinued, apparently unconscious of their emotions.\r\n\r\n“Billy,” he said, “you get the spade and dig a grave over close to the\r\nfence. After we get him planted, we’ll move that pile of old bean poles\r\nover the place. It’s kind of tough, but Louie is dead—and we got to look\r\nout for ourselves!”\r\n\r\nThe Strangler went silently out into the dark. They heard him rummaging\r\nfor a spade, and presently the _clink_ of the latter implement came\r\nindustriously to them. The grave was finished by the time the first gray\r\nlight of dawn began to filter down around the cottage, and presently\r\nthe body of the dead crook, wrapped in a blanket, was lowered into it.\r\nThen the dirt was shoveled back till the cavity would hold no more, and\r\nthe superfluous earth was scattered over the surface of the garden. The\r\nshifting of a pile of bean poles finished the ceremony.\r\n\r\n“I’ll trade rooms with you, Kid,” Monte said to the saturnine strong-arm\r\nman—who for once looked rather cowed. “I never was afraid of a dead\r\nman—just so that he was really dead. I guess you’re kind of soured on\r\nthat part of the house!”\r\n\r\n“Soured is right,” mumbled the “Kid.” “Say, I wouldn’t sleep in there\r\nif you was to give me all the sparklers in New York! Just let me get my\r\nstuff out!”\r\n\r\nAs he went back toward the room from which the body had recently been\r\nremoved, the “Kid” saw the mocking glance of the Strangler fastened\r\nupon him. Billy was enjoying his discomfiture. He went into the room\r\nand turned on the light—the burned-out bulb had been replaced, so that\r\nnow he was able to see into all the corners. He began to gather up his\r\nproperty, staring nervously about him the while.\r\n\r\nCautiously, he approached the closet, where he had stored his bathrobe\r\nand an extra suit, a couple of pairs of shoes and a pearl gray hat. He\r\nopened the door wide and stepped back. Nothing inside. Hastily he carted\r\nthe clothing out. Then he crossed over to the bureau and opened the\r\nleft-hand upper drawer, in which he had placed his jewelry—some rings and\r\ntie pins.\r\n\r\nThe “Kid” drew the drawer fully open and stood looking down into it. Then\r\na startled exclamation escaped him, and he bent nearer, staring wide-eyed.\r\n\r\nAll of his possessions were there; but in addition he saw, close to the\r\nback of the drawer, a morocco covered box of peculiar design. The “Kid”\r\nhad seen that box once before!\r\n\r\nWith trembling fingers he undid the clasp and opened the lid. He could\r\nfeel his heart pounding in the top of his head, and his throat seemed\r\nto contract, so that he fought for breath. The Resurrection Pendant! A\r\nsingle glance convinced him of that. But how had it come into this drawer?\r\n\r\nThe “Kid’s” mind deviated from the line of this natural inquiry. He could\r\nforget that for the moment—the fact was that here it was. But there was\r\nno reason why he should share this discovery with the other Wolves. This\r\nsupreme good fortune had come to him, not to them! He quickly shut the\r\nlid of the case and slid the box into an inside pocket.\r\n\r\nHe removed his property to Monte’s room, hiding the jewel case under the\r\nmattress. His blood had turned to liquid fire. He had that for which they\r\nhad all been searching—and it was his alone!...\r\n\r\nMonte went on guard that evening, taking “Doc” with him: not that Monte\r\nwas afraid, but he realized that the battle had now entered its final\r\nand decisive phase. And it was real war. Monte Jerome had no doubt that\r\nMartin had, in some mysterious way, been done to death in the house of Ah\r\nWing.\r\n\r\n“You boys better get to bed early,” he said. “Billy, you take the clock\r\nand set it for half past one. You wake the Kid as soon as you get\r\nup—we’ll stand double guard from now on!”\r\n\r\nThe “Kid” hardly heard Monte speaking. He wanted to examine the jewels\r\nagain, wanted to figure out just how he was going to make the break which\r\nwould free him from his comrades.\r\n\r\nFor a time, after the other two had departed, he sat around smoking and\r\ncleaning out the barrel of his pistol, which the fogs of this marshy\r\nneighborhood were corroding. He cleaned barrel and chamber and oiled the\r\naction, then replaced the clip of cartridges and slipped the gun into a\r\nside pocket.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he mumbled, half aloud, “I guess I’ll be getting to bed. An’ I\r\nhope to God there won’t be no voices around here tonight!”\r\n\r\nThe Strangler grunted, and the “Kid” slouched off up the stairs and into\r\nthe room that had been Monte’s. He closed the door carefully, crossed\r\nover to the light, and then stood listening.\r\n\r\nThe night wind was stirring around the house, whistling and moaning down\r\nthe chimney; but the “Kid” had an antidote for fear tonight: he went\r\nover to his bed and fumbled for the jewels. The touch of the smooth\r\nleather-covered box started his heart to pounding.\r\n\r\nHe laid the box on the bed and opened it. The light was reflected into\r\nhis eyes from a thousand sharp facets, crimson and blue and white—but\r\nperhaps the charm was wearing off: the stones did not look as wonderful\r\nto him tonight as they had in that momentary view he had caught during\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\n“And that’s the bunch of sparklers men go dippy about!” the “Kid”\r\nmumbled. “Hell, I wouldn’t give two bits for the whole bunch, if I\r\ncouldn’t sell ’em! There’s too many of ’em, and they don’t shine so\r\nterrible much! I saw a big buck nigger on State Street once with a\r\nsolitaire on that would have made them look phoney—and it was glass! Oh,\r\nwell, I should worry. I ain’t going to wear ’em—I’m going to _sell_ ’em!\r\nI’ll have to play safe—”\r\n\r\nAt the ghost of a sound from behind, the “Kid” whirled. He had left the\r\ndoor closed, but now it was open—and the Strangler stood inside the room,\r\ngrinning.\r\n\r\n“So, that was the game!” he cried. “You’re a slick one, Kid, but you\r\nain’t slick enough. I been watching you all evening. You ain’t yourself,\r\nold timer. You’re getting nervous. But I don’t wonder! You grabbed the\r\nsparklers, but how you done it I don’t know. And you was going to hold\r\n’em out, was you? Well, well—”\r\n\r\nThe “Kid’s” lips jerked up into a wolfish smile, but he forced himself\r\nto go slow. He needed to think this thing out. He knew the Wolves well\r\nenough to be sure they would hold this affair against him, and sooner\r\nor later would try to play even. No use to try to explain—they wouldn’t\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe Strangler was watching him through chilly eyes. Casually, the Kid’s\r\nhand stole toward his side pocket. Instantly the man standing before him\r\nacted: with a bellow of rage he jerked out his own hand, which he had\r\nbeen holding under his coat: swinging it up he fired, then struck at the\r\nlight globe with the smoking barrel.\r\n\r\nTo the “Kid” there came the sensation of suffocation and of darkness.\r\nHis own gun was out, but his enemy had disappeared—and he himself was\r\nsprawled across the bed. That instant of falling had not registered in\r\nhis consciousness: he had been standing, and now he was down; that was\r\nall he knew.\r\n\r\nAnd he was fighting for breath—a great weight seemed to be crushing in\r\nhis chest. He raised his left hand and gropingly explored the front of\r\nhis shirt: it was already saturated, and from a hole to the left of his\r\nbreast bone more blood was coming in a pulsing current.\r\n\r\n“The dirty dog!” muttered the “Kid” thickly, pulling himself erect by\r\ngrasping the foot of the bed. “He’s croaked me—”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the “Kid’s” whirling senses cleared. Billy the Strangler\r\nhad done for him; but he would send Billy on ahead, to tell St. Peter he\r\nwas coming! His yellow teeth came together. He felt something welling up\r\nin his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood.\r\n\r\n“Not—much—time—left!” he muttered.\r\n\r\nHe dropped to his knees and for a moment everything went blank. Then he\r\nmastered himself, by a superhuman effort: and began to crawl stealthily\r\nalong toward the dimly-lighted panel of the door. The Strangler had run\r\nout there after firing—now, undoubtedly, he was waiting till it should\r\nbe safe for him to come back for his booty!\r\n\r\nSlowly, the dying crook dragged himself across to the door and out into\r\nthe hall. The training of a lifetime stood him in good stead now: he was\r\nas soundless as a shadow. He reached the top of the stairs and paused,\r\nleaning for a moment against the banisters—everything was going black\r\nbefore him. Then he pulled himself together with a disregard for his own\r\nsuffering that in a better cause would have been heroic.\r\n\r\nInch by inch, he drew himself forward till he was sitting on the top step\r\nof the stair. He peered down into the lighted rooms below. Ah! There he\r\nwas! The Strangler stood beyond the big chandelier in the front room, the\r\n“Kid” could see him plainly through an open door. His face was smiling,\r\nthe crooked smile of a shark.\r\n\r\nResting his automatic across his bent knees, the “Kid” took steady aim at\r\nthe man who had done for him.\r\n\r\n“A little higher than the pockets!” he told himself, repeating the old\r\ngunman’s formula for a killing shot.\r\n\r\nNext moment the pistol roared; and the man standing down there in the\r\nlight jerked up his hands and staggered backward. Greedily, the “Kid’s”\r\nfast glazing eyes drank in every detail of the Strangler’s agony. He knew\r\nwhat that look meant—\r\n\r\nBilly the Strangler began to pivot on his heels, staring with blind eyes\r\ninto space.\r\n\r\n“Where is he?” he cried. “Damn your soul and body—you—”\r\n\r\nHe pitched forward to his face. And the “Kid,” leaning peacefully back,\r\nfelt himself snatched up into a great red cloud that has descended out of\r\nthe roof upon him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn an upper room in the house of Ah Wing, the Chinaman sat at an\r\ninstrument that resembled a telephone switchboard. There were on its\r\nsurface eight little globes, each with a plug socket beneath.\r\n\r\nAh Wing had an operator’s head-piece in position, and he seemed to be\r\nlistening attentively to something that came to him over the wires.\r\n\r\nThere had been voices, loud and angry. He heard the Strangler denouncing\r\nthe “Kid.” Then came the shot—and silence.\r\n\r\nAh Wing waited an appreciable time, then shifted the plug from socket\r\nto socket. Not a sound from any of the rooms in the distant cottage. He\r\nreturned the plug to its central position and waited.\r\n\r\nPresently another shot sounded, and a scream. He heard the Strangler\r\ncurse his enemy.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Ah Wing removed the head-piece and glanced up at a chart\r\nfastened to the wall before him. It contained the names of five men,\r\nagainst one of which a black cross had been inscribed.\r\n\r\nNow he picked up a pencil and filled in two additional crosses.\r\n\r\nThere were but two of the Wolves left!\r\n\r\n_This Fascinating Story Has An Amazing Climax.

Tell Your Newsdealer To Reserve Your\r\nCopy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSnatched from the Grave, Woman Tells of Death\r\n\r\n\r\nA weird adventure befell Mrs. Rafaela Mercurio, an Omaha woman who, after\r\napparently dying, awoke in the land of the living instead of the spirit\r\nworld. After her physician had pronounced her dead, her life was restored\r\nby an injection of adrenalin, administered by Dr. W. A. Gerrie.\r\n\r\nTo all outward appearance, she was quite dead. There was no indication of\r\nbreathing or heart action. Prayers for the dead were started in the bed\r\nchamber where her body lay.\r\n\r\nThen Dr. Gerrie injected the gland extract in her heart, and after\r\nseveral days she showed signs of returning life. Upon regaining\r\nconsciousness, she was confused and puzzled, uncertain, it seemed,\r\nwhether she was alive or dead. Later she described her strange experience.\r\n\r\n“I could feel death pulling me,” she said. “I was slipping. I tried to\r\nfind something to hold to, but could not. I felt far away and alone, yet\r\nit seemed there was something I must do before I slipped entirely away.\r\n\r\n“I had just a few minutes. I must straighten out in bed. I must cross\r\nmy hands on my breast. I must smile. My children must know that I died\r\nin peace. From far away there seemed to be people around me. But their\r\nvoices grew more distant.\r\n\r\n“Then there seemed to come to me the comforting words of a priest. They\r\nadded to my peace and content. I was ready for death. I smiled, I think.\r\nI know I wanted to. It was the last thing I remember.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, days after the first injection of adrenalin, the “dead” woman\r\nregained consciousness. It was four o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n“I shall never forget that hour,” she said. “I heard the clock strike\r\nfour times—and I realized I was a living person in a living world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Fanciful Novel of the Red Desert Complete In This Issue_\r\n\r\nDESERT MADNESS\r\n\r\n_By_ HAROLD FREEMAN MINERS\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER ONE_\r\n\r\nTHE GIRL AND THE HANDCUFFS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor a long moment the man surveyed with tired eyes the queer cleft in the\r\ncanon wall and the beaten trail that led into it.\r\n\r\nFinally he addressed the nearest of his two burros in a listless, half\r\nhumorous voice:\r\n\r\n“Well, Archibald, it looks interesting—what say we try it?”\r\n\r\nArchibald made no reply. Archibald was asleep. Immediately upon the\r\nhalting of the little cavalcade the burro had sunk into a state of\r\ndejection more apathetic than usual and had promptly gone to sleep. In\r\nfact, it is doubtful if Archibald had not been asleep the greater part of\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\n“You don’t care, eh, Archibald? Well, for that matter, neither do I. But\r\nlet’s consider this matter, old timer. For the last hundred years, more\r\nor less, we’ve been strolling around this accursed desert, and we have\r\nmade the acquaintance of a few cottontail rabbits, one or two coyotes,\r\nand a rattlesnake. The rabbits showed their distaste for our society\r\nby running away; the coyotes did nothing but deride us with mournful\r\nvoices; the rattlesnake certainly showed no desire to be friendly. We’ve\r\nmet no human being; we’ve discovered no fabulously rich gold mine; we’ve\r\nhad our fill of scenery.\r\n\r\n“There lies a well-beaten trail, disappearing into the face of solid\r\nrock. At its end lies mystery, adventure. Possibly romance. Also,\r\npossibly, cattle rustlers, who may greet us with anything but enthusiasm.\r\nIn which case we’ll throw in our lot with them, and I’ll ride you across\r\nthe desert to eternal glory. The idea intrigues me, Archibald. I think we\r\nshall investigate.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment an over-industrious flea must have launched a determined\r\nattack on one of the few vulnerable parts of Archibald’s anatomy, for he\r\nsuddenly nodded his head vigorously.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you agree with me? I knew you would. We will now follow the trail to\r\nadventure—or a sheep herder’s camp. Let’s go!”\r\n\r\nPercy, the second burro, was with difficulty herded into the narrow\r\ntrail. Archibald followed him with great reluctance, but finally the man\r\nsucceeded in driving his tiny pack train into concerted action, and they\r\nslowly trudged up the narrow defile.\r\n\r\nStanley Ross had been exiled to the desert country because certain\r\neminent New York doctors had come to the conclusion that he had\r\ncontracted a disease which yields itself to treatment most readily in the\r\ndry desert uplands.\r\n\r\nRoss had not been breathing the dry air of the desert for a month before\r\nhe was as healthy as a prize fighter. The fact was that Stanley Ross\r\nhad over-indulged in a certain pastime known as “reading the tape,” and\r\nNature had gone on a strike. The New York doctors had provided the first\r\nstep toward recovery; the desert had done the rest.\r\n\r\nBut there had been another hurt that had not healed so readily—or at\r\nleast Ross had so convinced himself. Stanley Ross fondly believed that he\r\nwas heart-broken. The cause was a blonde bit of New York femininity who\r\nhad fancied Ross for a while, but in the end had fancied the millions of\r\nan oil man more.\r\n\r\nSo he had stayed on in the West. A healthy restlessness had driven him\r\nout to explore the uncharted wastes of the vast Red Desert, and the ever\r\nchanging wonders of rock, and sand, and sky, of sagebrush and cactus, of\r\nsparkling night-heavens had beckoned him on. For months now he had been\r\nwandering up and down this immeasurable wonderland, obeying every vagary\r\nof mind, exploring every nook and cranny that caught his itinerant fancy,\r\nhis only companions the two burros which he had so whimsically named.\r\n\r\nMirages had beckoned. Colors so bizarre that no artist had dared to give\r\nthem to canvas had soothed his soul. Grotesqueries of rock and sand and\r\ncanon had intrigued him.\r\n\r\nRoss still believed that the old hurt was still present in his bosom.\r\nActually he had been having a capital time for months, and the girl no\r\nlonger mattered. However, he had allowed himself gradually to fall into\r\na state of whimsical melancholy. What he needed was adventure. He was\r\nbored, but had he known what lay at the end of the thin twisting trail\r\nbefore him his boredom might not have been so acute.\r\n\r\nThe rock defile, through which the trail led, was narrow, and the walls\r\nwere nearly perpendicular. The passage was twisting, but a tiny trickle\r\nof water gave promise of a broader canon farther up. The trail, while\r\nvery narrow, was well-defined and worn deep. It looked as though it had\r\nbeen in constant use for years.\r\n\r\nRoss had progressed along this strange passage for about a quarter mile\r\nwhen his attention was suddenly arrested by something on the canon wall.\r\nInvoluntarily, he stopped. Instantly the burros halted as though their\r\nmotive power was automatically turned off whenever their master stopped\r\nwalking.\r\n\r\n“Great Horned Toads!” ejaculated Ross in a low voice. “Archibald, do you\r\nsee what I see, or has the sun gone to my head? Has the world slipped\r\nback three centuries, or is it actually nineteen-twenty-three? ’Tain’t\r\npossible, Archibald, but nevertheless I see what I see!”\r\n\r\nThere, not thirty feet distant, was a girl—a pretty girl—and she was\r\nshackled to four great iron rings, fastened in the canon wall, by means\r\nof handcuffs, ankle fetters, and four heavy chains!\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER TWO_\r\n\r\nBROKEN SHACKLES AND A MYSTERY\r\n\r\nRoss stood spellbound. He could not believe his own eyes.\r\n\r\nThat he should meet a human being in this vast waste of rock and sand and\r\ncactus was possible. That he should find a girl chained to a rock, like a\r\nfelon of the black ages, was nothing short of incredible.\r\n\r\nThere was no denying the girl’s existence, however. She was there, and\r\nshe was in need of help.\r\n\r\nHis incredulity shattered, Ross was beside the girl in a bound. Even a\r\ncursory glance showed her to be undeniably pretty, and it also showed her\r\nto be quite as undeniably in a state of total exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAt Ross’s approach, the girl raised her head with difficulty. Her eyes\r\nopened and she smiled slowly. Then her whole body suddenly fell forward\r\nagainst the chains that held her. She had fainted.\r\n\r\nNo stranger situation could be imagined than the finding of a beautiful\r\ngirl chained to a rock in the midst of the great Red Desert. This,\r\nhowever, was a matter for future consideration. The girl needed immediate\r\nattention, and Ross’s first thought was to release her.\r\n\r\nWhen he examined her shackles Ross realized that release was not going to\r\nbe easy. The four rings to which the chains were fastened were secured to\r\nthe canon wall by means of heavy iron staples driven deep into fissures\r\nin the rock. A test of strength showed that nothing short of a charge of\r\ndynamite would ever loosen them.\r\n\r\nThe chains were comparatively heavy and well forged. A file was the only\r\nsolution—and Ross did not possess a file.\r\n\r\nNot till he examined the handcuffs did he see any hope of releasing\r\nthe girl. These were not of the ordinary type. They were not the steel\r\nmanacles of the sort used today, but were about two inches wide, heavy in\r\nconstruction and made of cast iron. The locking device was old-fashioned.\r\nThey were a type of handcuff that had been obsolete for nearly three\r\nquarters of a century.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied himself that they were really made of cast iron, Ross\r\nat once realized that it would be a comparatively easy task to free the\r\ngirl. Securing a small rock for a hammer, he braced the girl back against\r\nthe canon wall and held her wrist against the rock. A few well directed\r\nblows with the improvised hammer easily cracked the rusty cast iron and\r\nthe handcuff fell away in two pieces.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s wrist had been freed without more than slightly bruising the\r\nskin. The second handcuff was broken quite as easily. Ross gently lowered\r\nthe girl to the ground.\r\n\r\nReleasing her ankles was more difficult. The anklets were of heavier\r\nconstruction and harder to break without injuring the girl. However, by\r\nplacing a rock under the anklet and being careful, Ross finally managed\r\nto shatter the cast iron without more than bruising the girl’s slender\r\nankles.\r\n\r\nIn an instant he had jerked the pack from one of the burros and spread\r\nhis blanket roll out on the ground. Picking up the unconscious girl, he\r\nplaced her on the blankets and improvised a pillow from his coat.\r\n\r\nAlmost opposite where the girl had been chained the tiny trickle of water\r\nhad formed a miniature pool in the rocks. Seizing a tin cup from his camp\r\noutfit, Ross hurried to this pool, scooped up a cup of water, and in an\r\ninstant was kneeling at the girl’s side.\r\n\r\nDipping his fingers in the water, he flicked it across her face, then\r\ncarefully bathed her forehead, and then set to chafing her wrists.\r\n\r\nIt was fully ten minutes before the girl showed any evidence of returning\r\nconsciousness. Then her eyelids began to flutter. Finally she sighed\r\ndeeply, and her eyes slowly opened.\r\n\r\nStanley Ross thought he had never seen such a look of abject terror as\r\nnow appeared in the girl’s eyes. It was as though she had just awakened\r\nfrom a terrible dream and was still laboring under its terrorizing\r\ninfluence. Such a look might have appeared in the eyes of a slave girl\r\nwhen Nero ruled in Rome.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, consciousness battled with that nightmare that had been\r\nseething through the girl’s brain and finally won. Her eyes opened wide.\r\nA half smile slowly crossed her face. Whatever might have inspired her\r\nterror, the girl evidently recognized in Ross a friend.\r\n\r\nHer lips, dry and parched, moved with difficulty, but Ross saw that they\r\nframed the word “Water!”\r\n\r\nLifting her head, he dampened the girl’s lips from the cup and then\r\nallowed her to drink her fill. But weakness still held sway over her\r\nbody, and she sank back on the blankets, exhausted. Her eyes closed again.\r\n\r\n“Don’t try to talk,” advised Ross. “You just lie there and rest until I\r\nfix something for you. Then you can tell me about this thing.”\r\n\r\nFor once in his life, Ross was glad that he had taken another man’s\r\nadvice. When he had started his desert pilgrimage an old prospector\r\nhad advised him to include a few cans of soup in his outfit. Ross had\r\ndemurred, seeing no use in packing superfluous weight, but the old desert\r\nrat had insisted.\r\n\r\nRoss had included the soup. So far, he had had no use for it, but now it\r\nwas to show its worth.\r\n\r\nCollecting a few dry sticks from the stubby willows that grew around the\r\npool, Ross soon had a tiny fire going. Opening a can of soup, he heated\r\nit over the fire and carried a cup of it to the girl.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s so good!” she murmured after she had drained the cup. “Thank\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Do you feel like talking?” asked Ross.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the girl regarded him with frank eyes. Then she shook her\r\nhead wearily.\r\n\r\n“Not—not just yet—please. I’m—so—tired.” She sank back onto the blankets.\r\n\r\nRealizing that, for the present, rest was the most important thing for\r\nher, Ross covered the girl with a blanket and set about his camp duties.\r\n\r\nHe finished unpacking his burros and turned them loose to pick at the\r\nscanty tufts of grass that grew along the seeping stream. This done, he\r\nset about preparing his own meal.\r\n\r\nIt was already dusk, and by the time he had cooked and eaten his supper\r\ndarkness had settled down over the little canon. Washing his few dishes\r\nin the pool, Ross set them aside and turned his attention to finding\r\nenough firewood to keep the fire going.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness this was somewhat of a task, and Ross was absent from the\r\ncamp for some little time. When he returned he saw that his strange guest\r\nhad evidently fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nRoss threw some wood on the fire and sat down with his back against a\r\nrock. Filling his pipe, he lighted it and leaned back to contemplate the\r\nevents of the afternoon and evening.\r\n\r\nHis first mental reaction on finding the girl had been one of intense\r\nrage that any one, no matter what the cause or conditions, could be so\r\nutterly inhuman as to perpetrate such an act. He was still angry now, but\r\nhe had cooled off to the extent that he could consider the affair calmly.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no off-hand explanation whatever. As far as Ross knew,\r\nthere was no human habitation in all this desert waste, yet this trail up\r\nthe little canon had been used frequently and recently, so somewhere up\r\nthe winding trail must lie a solution to the mystery. But what it could\r\nbe, or whether he could ever solve it, Ross could not imagine.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair was grotesque, bizarre. Why any one should chain a young\r\ngirl to a rock wall in the midst of a heat-scorched desert was utterly\r\nincomprehensible. The girl was not gross or criminal-looking. On the\r\ncontrary, she was pretty, delicate, and obviously refined. Her clothes\r\nbespoke a far different environment. How any one could be so inhuman as\r\nto subject her to such treatment was unfathomable.\r\n\r\nSitting there, smoking and watching the girl, mulling the strangeness of\r\nthe affair over in his mind, Ross could offer himself no explanation. The\r\nonly thing to do, apparently, was to wait for the girl to awaken and\r\nthen wait for her to talk.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the adventure which he had craved seemed to be at hand.\r\nWhere it would lead him he had no idea.\r\n\r\nThe fire gradually burned low. The girl slept on. Ross removed the pipe\r\nfrom his mouth. His head nodded. In half an hour the campfire had wasted\r\nto an ember.\r\n\r\nThe man’s head had sunk forward onto his breast; his body had relaxed\r\ncomfortably against its support. He, too, was asleep.\r\n\r\nHours crept by....\r\n\r\nWith a start, Ross awoke. The first faint glow of dawn was creeping down\r\ninto the little canon. It was morning.\r\n\r\nSheepishly, Ross rubbed his eyes, aware that he had allowed the healthy\r\nfatigue of a day in the desert to conquer his senses and bring sleep when\r\nhe had intended to watch throughout the night.\r\n\r\nGradually the events of the evening before came back to him, and he\r\nlooked across to where he had wrapped the girl in his blankets. The bed\r\nwas empty!\r\n\r\n_The girl was gone!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER THREE_\r\n\r\nADVENTURE WITH A VENGEANCE\r\n\r\nIn an instant Ross was on his feet, the sleep fog automatically cleared\r\nfrom his brain.\r\n\r\nOne glance was enough. The dawn was far enough advanced so that he could\r\nsee both up and down the canon. It was patent that the girl had vanished\r\nduring the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair was so utterly impossible, so unreal, so like an Arabian\r\nNights adventure, that Ross was almost prone to believe that it had been\r\nmerely a dream, a desert hallucination. Not until his eyes again sought\r\nthe canon wall did he convince himself that he had not been laboring\r\nunder some mental aberration.\r\n\r\nThere could be no denying his eyes, though. There were the four heavy\r\nchains fastened to the canon wall, and there were the four broken\r\nshackles, mute evidence that he had stumbled onto a situation as exotic\r\nas one of the desert’s own mirages.\r\n\r\nNo, there could be no question that the girl had actually existed. Nor\r\ncould there be any question that she had disappeared. The only living\r\nthing in sight was Archibald, who stood with head bowed over the dead\r\nembers of last night’s fire in his usual state of ignoble dejection.\r\n\r\nAt first thought it seemed impossible that the girl could have left camp,\r\nunaided, and it seemed quite as certain that no one could have taken her\r\naway by force, without rousing Ross.\r\n\r\nAs he considered it, however, Ross realized that exhaustion would come\r\nquickly to one chained to the rock and exposed to the sun without food or\r\nwater. Recuperation would probably come quite as quickly. The girl had\r\nhad both water and nourishment the evening before, and it would have been\r\nquite possible for her to have gained sufficient strength to leave, had\r\nshe so chosen. There seemed to be no other explanation.\r\n\r\n“Well, Archibald,” said Ross, falling into his whimsical habit of\r\naddressing the burro, “when I started this trip I thought that you\r\nand Percy were the only asses in the party. Now I am convinced there\r\nare three of us. Here I have just been craving adventure for months.\r\nYesterday I blundered right onto the craziest kind of a mystery, and\r\nthen I go to sleep and let the whole thing get away from me! Fools can’t\r\nthink, but I suppose they’ve got to eat,” he finished to himself.\r\n\r\nHe set about preparing his breakfast, meanwhile pondering the affair. The\r\nmore he pondered the more mysterious it became.\r\n\r\nBreakfast finished, he washed his dishes and then stepped over to gather\r\nup his bed-roll. Instantly he stopped short. There before him, scratched\r\nin the level sand of the canon floor, was a message:\r\n\r\n    “_Please go away. There is only great danger if you investigate\r\n    further._”\r\n\r\nThere could be no denying the sincerity of that message. Coupled with the\r\nsilent testimony of the inhuman shackles, it meant that the girl, whoever\r\nshe might be, was in real peril.\r\n\r\nRegaining her strength, she had quietly slipped away in the night, but\r\nbefore going she had left behind a warning to the man who had released\r\nher. It was evident that she did not wish to draw a stranger into a\r\ndanger which she considered hers alone.\r\n\r\nThe warning, however, reacted on Ross like a red rag on a bull. It was\r\na challenge to his manhood, to his thirst for adventure. Somewhere up\r\nthat narrow canon was mystery; and somewhere, too, was a girl in unknown\r\ndanger, a girl who patently enough needed assistance and a friend.\r\n\r\nIt took but a few minutes to round up the burros and rope on the packs.\r\n\r\n“We will now proceed to rescue the fair maiden.”\r\n\r\n“Stick ’em up, an’ do it quick!”\r\n\r\nRoss whirled at the sound of the gruff voice—and found himself looking\r\nsquarely into the muzzle of an ugly six-shooter. Behind it, was the most\r\nvillainous-looking countenance Ross had ever seen.\r\n\r\n“Come on! H’ist ’em up!” again jerked out the owner of the gun.\r\n\r\nThe situation was too unreal to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Archibald, the plot thickens! First we meet Beauty; now we meet\r\nthe Beast. Point that gun the other way, my friend. It might go off and\r\nfrighten my long-eared friend here. He’s delicate, and I don’t like to\r\nhave his nerves shocked.”\r\n\r\n“H’ist them mits before I drill ya!”\r\n\r\nRoss felt the muzzle of the gun jammed into his ribs, and a practised\r\nhand quickly searched his body. His automatic, carried for the sole\r\npurpose of exterminating rattlesnakes, was transferred to the other’s\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nThe vicious attitude of the gunman was far too real to be taken lightly.\r\nThere was no doubt that he meant business.\r\n\r\n“Ya can let ’em down now,” said the gunman, stopping back.\r\n\r\nRoss turned and surveyed his captor.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind telling me,” he asked coldly, “to whom am I indebted\r\nfor this early morning call?”\r\n\r\n“Stow the flip gab. All I know is tha big boss said to bring ya in, an’\r\nI’m bringin’ ya.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’m to understand that I’m a captive?”\r\n\r\n“Understan’ anythin’ ya please. Now git travelin’.”\r\n\r\nResistance was hopeless. His air of reckless bravado gone, boiling\r\ninwardly at the indignity forced upon him, Ross swung and trudged off up\r\nthe canon trail.\r\n\r\nFor perhaps a quarter of a mile the narrow canon cleaved straight through\r\nthe rock. Then it suddenly began a series of intricate turns, as though\r\nit had attempted a passage and had been baffled and forced to take a new\r\ndirection about every fifty feet.\r\n\r\nFor a while, Ross stalked on without speaking. Suddenly he turned his\r\nhead and spoke.\r\n\r\n“Just where are you taking me, and who is the ‘big boss’?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind askin’ dam’ fool questions. Keep movin’!”\r\n\r\nAfter another quarter mile of sharp turns, the canon suddenly broadened,\r\nand Ross found himself looking out into a basin bounded on all sides by\r\nhigh, perpendicular rock walls, smooth and straight.\r\n\r\nThe basin was oval in shape, and near the center was a group of ’dobe\r\nbuildings, five in number. Toward these the captor directed their\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced, Ross looked keenly for signs of life, but though he\r\nsought every possible nook and cranny with his gaze, he could see neither\r\nman nor beast. The place seemed to be absolutely deserted.\r\n\r\nAt the first building, a small ’dobe structure that stood somewhat apart\r\nfrom the others, Ross was ordered to halt. Opening a heavy door, the man\r\nmotioned with his gun for him to enter. Ross stepped over the threshold,\r\nand instantly the door clanged shut behind him.\r\n\r\nHe heard the heavy bolt drop into place. Then he heard his captor walking\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time, it dawned on Ross that he was actually a\r\nprisoner, and that he had been captured with some definite object in view.\r\n\r\nThe room in which he found himself was about twelve feet square. The\r\nwalls were of ’dobe; the floor was of the same material, hard packed and\r\nsmooth. There were two small windows, but both were heavily protected\r\nwith thick iron bars, set deep in the hard-packed ’dobe. The furniture\r\nconsisted of a crude table and chair.\r\n\r\nA single test of strength showed Ross that he could never hope to open\r\nthe door. A crowbar or an axe would be necessary for that, and there\r\nwas no implement of any kind in the room. The walls were fully eighteen\r\ninches thick. Under the fierce heat of the desert the ’dobe had grown as\r\nhard as cement. Unless he received help from outside, there seemed to be\r\nno possibility of escape.\r\n\r\nTime passed. Finally he ceased his idle wandering about the room and sank\r\ninto the chair.\r\n\r\nHis pipe and tobacco still remained in his pocket. He took out his pipe,\r\nlighted it, and fell to considering his strange predicament.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that ages had passed before he detected approaching footsteps.\r\nThe bolt was raised. The heavy door swung on its hinges. His captor stood\r\noutside, gun in hand. Behind him was a Chinaman, carrying a tray on which\r\nwas food.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese entered the room, placed the tray on the table and arranged\r\nthe food. As he was performing this service, he said in a low whisper,\r\nso low that his companion could not hear, “Missee say Wong flix good\r\ndlinner.”’\r\n\r\n“Come on, Chink, make it snappy!” snapped the man with the gun.\r\n\r\nThe door slammed. The bolt fell into place. Ross was alone again.\r\n\r\nDubiously, he surveyed the food. The words of the Chinese came back to\r\nhim, “Missee say Wong flix good dlinner.”\r\n\r\nSo the girl knew that he was a captive. Well, all he could do was wait.\r\nBut who was she? And what did his imprisonment mean?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there was no reason for wasting a good dinner. Ross was\r\nhungry, and in twenty minutes the last scrap of food had disappeared.\r\n\r\nSettling back in his chair, he again filled his pipe and prepared to\r\nawait developments with as good grace as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was hours later that he heard footsteps nearing his prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER FOUR_\r\n\r\nROSS IS INVITED TO DINE\r\n\r\nRoss heard a key in the lock, and a moment later the heavy door swung\r\nopen. It was the gunman again. He was evidently not mindful to take any\r\nchances with his prisoner, for he again was holding his revolver ready.\r\n\r\n“Come on out!” he barked, motioning with the gun for Ross to step out of\r\nthe room. “Tha big boss wants ya.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he does?” returned Ross. “Maybe I’ll find out now what all this is\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll find out all right. Mebbe find out more’n ya want.”\r\n\r\n“You know, I don’t think I’m going to like you at all. I shouldn’t be\r\nsurprised if I had serious trouble with you yet. But lead on!”\r\n\r\nRoss’s persiflage was far from pleasing to the gunman. He glared\r\nmalevolently at Ross for a moment, as if half minded to inflict physical\r\npunishment, finally thought better of it, and then jerked out, “I ain’t\r\nleadin’; I’m followin’. Git movin’!”\r\n\r\nRoss was conducted to the largest of the group of ’dobe buildings,\r\nevidently used as a dwelling, and was ushered directly into a bedroom.\r\n\r\nHe had expected anything except what he now saw. The room was such as\r\nmight have been found in a brown-stone mansion on Fifth Avenue. The\r\nfloor was covered with a deep soft rug. There was a mahogany bed, with a\r\nspotless white spread, and a dressing-table of the same wood. To one side\r\nof the latter stood a full-length plate mirror.\r\n\r\n“The big boss said ya was to shave, an’ then ya was ta dress fer dinner.\r\nYo’ll find all tha togs there on that bed.” The gunman directed Ross’s\r\nattention to the bed with a flourish of his gun.\r\n\r\nRoss looked. The garments on the bed comprised a complete evening\r\noutfit, from studded shirt to patent-leather pumps.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised to find that the clothes fit him well. The pumps were a\r\ntrifle tight and the suit was a bit snug, but a half hour later, when he\r\nsurveyed himself in the long pier glass, he was well satisfied.\r\n\r\n“All right, keeper, let’s be on our way. I’m curious,” he said.\r\n\r\nHis captor conducted him down the long veranda, and a moment later he was\r\nushered into a large room where a table was laid for dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER FIVE_\r\n\r\nA STRANGE DINNER\r\n\r\nBy this time Ross was prepared for almost anything, yet the room that he\r\nnow stepped into was even more astounding than the bedroom.\r\n\r\nIn the center stood a table arranged for four. It fairly sparkled with\r\nglassware, silver and spotless linen. At one side of the room stood a\r\nhuge buffet. Its top was well covered with glasses, liquor shakers and\r\nsundry bottles, the contents of which were obvious.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the room chiefly held his attention, though. They were\r\nthree, two men and a woman. Here, at last, he was to know the meaning of\r\nthe strange events of the preceding twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe two men were standing close together and had evidently been\r\nconversing. Both were in faultless evening dress. The girl stood apart;\r\naloof, so it seemed. Despite her evening dress, Ross instantly recognized\r\nher as the girl he had found in the canon.\r\n\r\nOne of the men was young and exceedingly well built. His wide, heavily\r\nmuscled shoulders suggested out-of-the-ordinary strength. His hair was\r\nwiry and red; its color was amply reflected in his ruddy complexion. The\r\nface was strong and would have been attractive but for one feature—the\r\neyes. The eyes were small, deep-set, and far too close together. They\r\nmight have been said to be piggish. The dull glint in them was not\r\nreassuring. Ross knew at once that he did not like this man.\r\n\r\nIt was the second of the two men, however, who was really striking.\r\nHe was, in fact, an amazing figure. His stature was above the average\r\nheight, over six feet, and he was thin to emaciation. Ross thought he\r\nhad never seen so tall and yet so slender a man. He was so thin as to be\r\nludicrous, yet there seemed to be a remarkable whipcord strength about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis face was narrow and as lean as his body. A thin, high nose divided\r\na pair of piercing black eyes. It was the eyes that struck instant\r\nattention. Their everchanging lights fairly gleamed. They seemed to be\r\nalive with a thousand fires.\r\n\r\nThe impression was instantly registered with Ross that here was a man who\r\nwas possessed of unusual personal power, or who was stark mad. Those eyes\r\ncould allow of no other conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs Ross was ushered into the room it was this strange individual who\r\ninstantly stepped forward.\r\n\r\n“Ah, our guest has arrived,” he said. His voice was soft as velvet, yet\r\nit carried an irritating quality that was thin-edged and biting, and\r\nscarcely concealed. “Step right up, Mr. Waring; dinner will be served at\r\nonce. Wong, the wine.”\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere the Chinese, Wong, had glided forth and, drawing out a\r\nchair, indicated Ross’s place at the table. Immediately he had filled the\r\nglasses with a sparkling liquid. Ross recognized it as champagne.\r\n\r\nThere was no chance to reply. In fact, Ross was too bewildered to think\r\nof anything adequate to say. In a moment he would be himself again, but\r\njust now his wits were all at cross purposes.\r\n\r\nAs the elderly man greeted Ross, the girl and younger man took their\r\nplaces at the table as if they had only been waiting his arrival to\r\nproceed with the meal. As Ross stepped forward, at the servant’s\r\nindication, his host reached out and lifted the wine glass at his plate.\r\n\r\n“We will drink to the health of our guest,” he said evenly.\r\n\r\nAutomatically, Ross lifted his glass. The others did likewise. For an\r\ninstant the four glasses were held aloft, the lights playing on their\r\nsparkling depths. Then the elderly man turned to Ross with a rather\r\nelaborate low bow and said in a voice that was like gray steel:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waring, allow us to drink to your most excellent good health——_for\r\ntomorrow you hang_!”\r\n\r\nThe words were like an icy blast. Up to that moment the whole affair had\r\nbeen rather ludicrous to Ross. He had realized that he was in danger at\r\ntimes, but that this danger would involve the loss of his life he had not\r\nfor a moment imagined.\r\n\r\nNow he realized that his very life was at stake; more than that, unless\r\nhe could find some way to extract himself from his predicament, that\r\nhe was sure to forfeit it. There could be no denying the import of the\r\ntoast. Ross did not know why, but he did know that this tall, lean\r\nstranger with the mad eyes meant to kill him as sure as he stood there.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, the young New Yorker lost his complacency. He stood with\r\nthe glass poised in his hand, his brain whirling. But this was only for\r\na moment. In a second he had regained his poise. Raising the glass to his\r\nlips, he drained it to the bottom and turned to his host.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” he said carelessly, “for your kind wishes for my good\r\nhealth. I hate to dispute you, but I _don’t_ believe you will hang me in\r\nthe morning. And my name is not Waring, either. It happens to be Ross.”\r\n\r\n“As you will, Mr. Waring, as you will. Any name would do as well. And\r\nI assure you I shall have the pleasure of hanging you in the morning.\r\nLet me warn you, too, Mr. Waring, not to attempt anything. I want this\r\ndinner peaceful. It is an engagement dinner,” turning with an exaggerated\r\nbow to the girl, “the occasion of the betrothal of my dear niece to Mr.\r\nBeebe here. I _know_ you will be interested in that, Mr. Waring. But\r\njust to forestall any idea you might have of providing any unnecessary\r\nentertainment I have stationed my friends, Mr. Garfin and Mr. Poole, at\r\nthe door with instructions to shoot if you get unruly. Now, let us eat.”\r\n\r\nRoss glanced over his shoulder to find Garfin lounging in the door\r\nby which he had entered, a malignant smile wrinkling his face. In an\r\nopposite doorway lounged another individual fully as ugly looking as\r\nGarfin. This was evidently Poole. Both had guns. It was obvious that for\r\nthe present no break for liberty was possible.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, that dinner was a nightmare to Ross. Afterward he\r\nwondered how he had managed to get through it.\r\n\r\nAfter the first effusion, the elderly man made no effort to include Ross\r\nin the conversation. Glad of this respite, Ross attempted to collect his\r\nwits and to form some estimate of his predicament and of the people with\r\nwhom he had to deal.\r\n\r\nThe elderly man carried on a continuous animated conversation, mostly\r\nwith the man whom he had designated as Beebe. Several times he addressed\r\nhimself to Ross, but always in such a manner that it was obvious no\r\nanswer was expected. A number of times he included the girl in his\r\nconversation, but the only time she made reply was to answer a question,\r\nand then it was merely to say, “No, Uncle Arthur.”\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Beebe addressed the elderly man as “Mr. Ward,” so Ross\r\nconcluded that his name was Arthur Ward. The girl’s identity he was not\r\nable to learn, except that her first name was Virginia.\r\n\r\nBeebe ignored Ross and by his attitude seemed to be currying favor with\r\nWard. As for the girl, she remained silent, her eyes downcast, palpably\r\nholding herself aloof. Once or twice Ross caught a fleeting message from\r\nher eyes. It seemed to him that she was in utter terror, yet in perfect\r\ncontrol of her nerves.\r\n\r\nIn those flashing telegrams from her eyes Ross was sure he caught a mute\r\nappeal for help. If this was a betrothal dinner Ross felt sure that the\r\nbetrothal was without the consent of one of the parties concerned, and he\r\nwas determined then and there not only to effect his own escape but to\r\naid the girl as well.\r\n\r\nThe food was excellent and perfectly served by the Chinese, yet Ross\r\ncould not have told a single item, and he thought the dinner never would\r\nend. The presence of Garfin and Poole was mute evidence that for the\r\npresent he could do nothing. When the meal finally came to an end and\r\nWard pushed back his chair, it brought a feeling of distinct relief to\r\nthe young man. Now at least was the beginning of the end.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Waring,” said Ward suavely, “we will repair to my study, where\r\nI have a few things to say to you before we break up this very pleasant\r\nlittle party. I hardly think my niece will care to accompany us.”\r\n\r\nThey rose from the table, and Ross was ushered into an adjoining room\r\nwhich was even more striking in its way than either of the others he had\r\nbeen in that evening.\r\n\r\nA brisk fire burned on a wide hearth from above which looked down a\r\nmagnificent ram’s head. Other trophies of a similar nature adorned\r\nthe other walls. Interspersed with these were guns, Indian weapons,\r\nhorsehair lariats—in fact, every accoutrement and trophy of the old-time\r\nWest. It was a rather remarkable collection, one which under different\r\ncircumstances would have deeply interested Stanley Ross.\r\n\r\nInstantly he knew where those curious antiquated shackles, which had\r\nbound the girl, had come from. Here were several similar pairs.\r\n\r\nRoss was directed to a chair in front of the fire. Ward took another,\r\nfacing him, while Beebe sat down on a wide bench on the far side of the\r\nfire. Ross waited expectantly.\r\n\r\nWard offered his guest a cigar. Selecting one for himself, he clipped its\r\nend very deliberately and lit it with aggravating leisure. Finally he\r\nleaned back in his chair and gazed steadily at Ross with his mad eyes. A\r\ntiny smile, cynical and cruel, crooked around his thin-lipped mouth.\r\n\r\n“I could have had you killed at once, Mr. Waring,” he said deliberately,\r\nhis voice soft and well-modulated, yet biting, burning, “but I did not\r\nchoose to do that. Instead, I wanted to bring you here this evening so\r\nthat you could fully realize just what a serious thing it is, and how\r\nuseless it is to buck Arthur Ward. And then, too, I wanted my niece to\r\nknow that I am to be obeyed absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose, Mr. Ward,” asked Ross, “that it would be quite useless to\r\ntell you that my name is not Waring at all; that I do not even know\r\nany one of that name, or that I have never seen your niece, until last\r\nevening?”\r\n\r\n“Quite useless, I can assure you, Mr. Waring. I am absolutely certain of\r\nyour identity. I do not make mistakes.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Waring, I never forget an injury. I remember forever, and my one bad\r\ntrait is the fact that I always have revenge. I would have got you in the\r\nend, Waring, anyway, but your fool stunt of following my niece here saved\r\nme a lot of trouble. Waring, you should have known that of all people on\r\nearth you would have the least chance of marrying my niece.\r\n\r\n“Tonight you can have the extreme pleasure of reflecting that you will\r\nhardly be dead before Virginia will be the wife of Beebe.”\r\n\r\n“And suppose she refuses?” asked Ross.\r\n\r\n“We are a hundred miles from anywhere, Waring. Things could happen that\r\nwould make Virginia glad to marry Beebe—or any one.\r\n\r\n“One more thing, Waring, and then we will terminate this interview,”\r\nWard went on dispassionately. “I want you to know that this is only the\r\nbeginning. I shall not be satisfied until I have exterminated your entire\r\nfamily. It may take me years, but I shall certainly have the pleasure of\r\nkilling your brother and your father. It does not pay to do injury to\r\nArthur Ward.\r\n\r\n“You will have tonight to reflect on what might have been. In the morning\r\nI shall hang you.\r\n\r\n“That is all I have to say, and since it will be quite useless for you\r\nto say anything you may as well return to your room. Mr. Garfin and Mr.\r\nPoole will see that you have safe conduct.”\r\n\r\nRoss knew that for the present he would have to submit. Resistance would\r\nbe useless just now. He was one against four. The odds were too great. He\r\ncould only wait, hoping that the night would bring opportunity.\r\n\r\nHowever, before he went he could not resist a last display of\r\nbravado—bravado which he did not by any means feel.\r\n\r\nRising from his seat, Ross bowed low to Ward.\r\n\r\n“Good-night, Mr. Ward. Thank you for a most excellent dinner and a most\r\nentertaining evening. And let me assure you that you will _not_ hang me\r\nin the morning.”\r\n\r\nTurning on his heel, Ross passed out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER SIX_\r\n\r\nA FORLORN HOPE\r\n\r\nWhen Ross stepped out into the darkness his first thought was that he\r\nwould make a dash for liberty. This hope died almost before it was born,\r\nthough, for he felt the muzzle of a revolver pressed close to his ribs\r\nand Garfin’s rasping voice growled into his ear:\r\n\r\n“Make just one move fer a break an’ I’ll plug ya. The boss says he’s\r\ngoin’ to hang ya in the morning, but I’d like to save him tha trouble.”\r\n\r\nRoss knew that Garfin was not indulging in idle words. The gunman would\r\ngladly kill him. Then, too, out in the shadows another form kept them\r\nclose company. He knew this was Poole and that should he succeed in\r\nworsting Garfin his chance of escaping the second gunman’s bullets was\r\nvery remote. No, the time was not yet.\r\n\r\nThe three trudged back to Ross’s one-room prison, and it was only a\r\nminute or two until the door had slammed on him, the bolt had fallen into\r\nplace and the lock snapped its vicious message.\r\n\r\nHe was once more a prisoner.\r\n\r\nRoss sought in the darkness for the crude chair and threw himself down\r\ninto it. He knew that for the time being there was no chance of escape,\r\nso he gave himself up momentarily to a contemplation of his plight.\r\n\r\nWho was this strange girl whom he had rescued, only to have her vanish\r\ninto the night? Why had she not spoken tonight? Why had she given him no\r\nhint of action? Who was Beebe, that he would accept a betrothal which was\r\nobviously odious to the girl? And, lastly, who was Ward with his mad eyes?\r\n\r\nWho was Waring, and what had he done to merit such malicious vengeance on\r\nthe part of Ward?\r\n\r\nThese and many other questions Ross asked himself, but he had no\r\nsatisfactory answer to any one of them. Only a jumble of baffling mystery\r\npresented itself. His brain seethed with impossible solutions, but he had\r\nto admit that actually he was completely at sea.\r\n\r\nOnly a few facts stood out which could be accepted as a basis on which to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nHe, Ross, had been taken for another man, Waring by name. Ward evidently\r\nhated Waring intensely and was determined to put him to death for a\r\nwrong, either fancied or real. There could be no doubt, too, that Ward\r\nwas, in a degree, insane.\r\n\r\nWhat part Beebe was playing Ross could not determine, beyond the facts\r\nthat he was in favor with Ward and that he wanted the girl and would take\r\nher on whatever terms he could get her.\r\n\r\nThe girl was obviously in great peril. It could be seen that she hated\r\nBeebe, but at the same time was powerless to resist any order of her\r\nuncle. Ross could readily see that she was in a position where death\r\nmight well be preferable to what she was facing.\r\n\r\nAnd, undeniably, there was the fact that he, Ross, was sure to meet death\r\nin the morning unless he could devise some way out of his dilemma.\r\n\r\nThe night was far gone when he had finished considering these things.\r\nIt was then that a plan of action first suggested itself to him. As it\r\nmatured in his mind he realized that it was a forlorn hope; but his\r\ncircumstances were so utterly desperate that there seemed nothing to do\r\nbut give it a trial. He knew that its success would depend entirely on\r\nthe element of surprise.\r\n\r\nHaving once settled in his mind what he should do, Ross threw himself\r\ndown on the crude table and was soon sound asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly daylight when he awoke, but he did not allow himself to\r\ndrop back to sleep again. He was going to be ready.\r\n\r\nIt was fully three hours later that he heard approaching footsteps.\r\nSlipping quietly across the room, Ross flattened himself against the wall\r\nbeside the door and waited.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps drew nearer and nearer. A key grated in the lock. It\r\nclicked. The bolt was raised. Slowly the door swung on its hinges.\r\n\r\nLike a flash, Ross slipped from his hiding-place and darted through the\r\ndoorway. The only human within sight was Garfin. Like a mad thunderbolt\r\nRoss bore down upon him.\r\n\r\nTaken by surprise, Garfin barely had time to fire before Ross was upon\r\nhim. Too startled to take definite aim, his bullet went wild. With a\r\nforce that was terrific Ross struck him with the full impact of his body.\r\nThe two went down in a tangled heap. Garfin’s gun was knocked from his\r\ngrasp and went spinning a dozen feet away.\r\n\r\nGarfin was not without courage of a kind, but all his life he had\r\ndepended on a gun to enforce his arguments. Physical combat had not been\r\none of his long suits, and now he found himself no match for his younger\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nStan Ross was far from a weakling physically. Long months afoot in\r\nthe desert had made him as hard as nails. Not so long ago he had been\r\nknown as a football player of some note. Now he used that knowledge of\r\nrough-and-tumble combat to the fullest extent.\r\n\r\nTaking Garfin by surprise, Ross had the initial advantage, and when the\r\ntwo went down he was on top. Striking, kicking, using the crushing force\r\nof his body, he went at the gunman in a demoniacal storm. For an instant\r\nit looked as though he would beat his enemy into insensibility before he\r\ncould offer any material resistance.\r\n\r\nBut Garfin was fighting for his life and he knew it. He was not to be\r\nvanquished so easily. In a moment the two men were threshing and rolling\r\non the ground in a fierce struggle.\r\n\r\nYouth, however, was not to be denied. Those sledge-hammer blows were\r\nhaving a telling effect. Garfin was weakening. Gradually Ross was wearing\r\nhim down.\r\n\r\nRoss sought the throat of his enemy. Garfin’s breath came in gasps. His\r\neyes were bulging. Gradually Ross brought his knee up until it pressed\r\ninto Garfin’s stomach. A final effort would end the struggle. Slowly\r\nGarfin’s head bent backward. Then—\r\n\r\nA crashing, blinding blow caught Ross on his head. For a brief instant a\r\nmillion fires flamed before his eyes. Then utter blackness.\r\n\r\nHe slumped forward across the body of his antagonist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER SEVEN_\r\n\r\nWONG INTERVENES\r\n\r\nWhen Ross returned to consciousness it was with a sense of bewilderment.\r\nHis head seemed alive with shooting pains: his eyes burned intensely; his\r\nbody was sore and stiff.\r\n\r\nGradually he fought the fog from his brain and opened his eyes. He was\r\ndimly aware that he was back in his prison room, stretched out on the\r\ntable. Painfully he sat up.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw that he was not alone. There was another person in the\r\nroom. As his eyes pierced the semi-gloom he was aware that the man before\r\nhim was Arthur Ward.\r\n\r\nInstantly his brain cleared, and he swung himself around to face his\r\njailor.\r\n\r\nWard was standing in the center of the room, his feet wide apart, his\r\nhands behind his back. A sardonic smile disfigured his face.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he inquired, “so you decided not to die?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I decided not to die,” said Ross. “I might remind you, too, that it\r\nis no longer morning and I have not been hung.”\r\n\r\n“No, and you’re not going to be, either. I have prepared a much more\r\npleasant death for you.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t waste your thanks,” replied Ward. “Before you’re through you’ll be\r\nfar from thanking me. You see, Waring, your little outbreak this morning\r\nset me to thinking. If you had taken things quietly I would have hung\r\nyou, and it would all be over now. But you had to try to escape and that\r\nset me to thinking that hanging was too pleasant for you. It would be\r\nover too quickly. There would be no time for reflection. So I devised\r\nsomething really fitting for your case.”\r\n\r\nWhile Ward was speaking the man Poole had entered, carrying a wooden box\r\nwhich he deposited gingerly in one corner and then quickly withdrew. He\r\nseemed afraid.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Waring,” Ward went on, “I’ve planned a death for you that I like\r\nmuch better than hanging. And, damn your rotten soul to eternity,” he\r\nsnarled, “you’ll know what real torture is before you go out!”\r\n\r\nWith a sudden movement, he whirled, kicked the lid from the box, darted\r\nthrough the doorway, and had crashed the door shut before Ross fairly\r\nrealized what he was doing.\r\n\r\nHalf bewildered, it was a moment before he could attach any meaning to\r\nWard’s action. Then it dawned on him that there was a deep significance\r\nto the box which Poole had brought in. Some sinister portent lay in that\r\nbox of wood.\r\n\r\nFascinated, Ross sat watching the box, realizing that it held his fate,\r\nscarce knowing what to expect, and certainly not expecting what developed.\r\n\r\nFor a long minute nothing happened. Ross grew nervous with the strain.\r\nThen a faint buzzing came from the box. Silence. Again came that strange\r\nsound. And again. A slithering rustle as of stiff silk rubbed together.\r\n\r\nAnd then Ross’s scalp prickled with horror and his blood fairly froze in\r\nhis veins, for over the edge of the box appeared a hideous, swaying head!\r\nThere came a second! A third! And then a fourth!\r\n\r\n_They were huge diamond-back rattlesnakes!_\r\n\r\nAs Ross recognized the big diamond-backs he knew instantly that he was\r\ntrapped. To step down onto the floor meant death, a horrible, grewsome\r\ndeath. To remain on the table—\r\n\r\nInstinctively, he drew his feet up onto the table as the big reptiles\r\nleft the box, one by one. He counted eight in all.\r\n\r\nRoss gave himself up to black despair. Down there on the floor awaited a\r\nfate too hideous for words....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must have been fully two hours later, and dusk was already settling\r\ndown and darkening the room, when Ross heard footsteps.\r\n\r\nThey approached his prison. For a moment his heart leaped within him at\r\nthe possibility of rescue. But the door did not open. Instead, he heard\r\nthe taunting voice of Ward from outside:\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’re safe enough so far, Waring. They can’t get you as long as\r\nyou stay on that table. I planned that. Wasn’t it kind of me to be so\r\nthoughtful? But there won’t be any food and there won’t be any water, and\r\nall the time you’ll be going through hell. I planned that, too. And then\r\nthere’ll come a time when you can’t stand it any longer. You’ll either\r\nfall from the table from weakness, or you’ll go mad and step down onto\r\nthe floor. They’ll always be waiting, Waring. And then they’ll get you,\r\ndamn you!” The voice, rising to a shrill crescendo of passion, ended in a\r\nburst of wild maniacal laughter.\r\n\r\nReceding footsteps told him that Ward had gone away.\r\n\r\nAs the gloom deepened into utter darkness it seemed to Ross that he would\r\ngo mad. His brain seethed with wild impulses. A hundred times he pictured\r\nhimself lying there on the floor, a bloated, blackened thing. A hundred\r\ntimes he went through death. Only that hope which “springs eternal” kept\r\nhim from stepping down onto the floor and making an end of it.\r\n\r\nGradually Ross quieted. He finally settled back against the wall in a\r\nstate of apathy, little knowing or little caring when the end would come.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ross became aware of an unusual sound. From somewhere in back\r\nof him came a low “_Hist!_” so low as hardly to be heard. Stealthily, he\r\nraised himself to the height of the barred window and peered into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nDimly he could make out a head outlined against the sky. A low, whispered\r\nvoice spoke:\r\n\r\n“_You take!_”\r\n\r\nUnmistakably it was the voice of Wong. There was a grating sound as of\r\nsomething being passed between the bars.\r\n\r\nRoss reached out his hand and it closed over cold steel.\r\n\r\nAn automatic!\r\n\r\n“_You take!_” again came the whispered voice.\r\n\r\nThis time Ross found his hand closing over a cartridge belt.\r\n\r\n“Me bring Ga’fin. _You shoot!_”\r\n\r\nLike a ghost, the form at the window was gone without a sound.\r\n\r\nWith the feel of that cold steel in his hand Ross’s spirits rose like a\r\ntide. All his waning confidence returned. He was instantly his own man\r\nagain, confident, cool, without fear.\r\n\r\nQuickly he buckled the belt around his waist. With sure fingers, he made\r\ncertain that the gun was loaded. Slipping off the safety, he knelt on the\r\ntable, facing the door, and waited.\r\n\r\nRoss did not know whether he would ever leave that room alive, but he did\r\nknow that the first men to open the door would die.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER EIGHT_\r\n\r\n“YOU’LL SETTLE WITH ME”\r\n\r\nArthur Ward stood with his back to the big living-room fire, his feet\r\nwide apart, hands crossed behind his back, head lowered, eyes peering\r\nfrom beneath shaggy brows. It was a characteristic attitude and one which\r\npeculiarly expressed the man’s calculated cruelty.\r\n\r\nBeebe was seated on the wide fireplace bench, his feet stretched far in\r\nfront of him. He was slowly smoking, his whole sprawling attitude one of\r\nindolent approval. Things were shaping themselves quite to the liking of\r\nLarson Beebe.\r\n\r\nThe girl, Virginia, was seated in a chair somewhat in front of her uncle.\r\nThe wild look of her eyes and her agitated face told that she was going\r\nthrough an ordeal that was breaking her bit by bit.\r\n\r\n“But, Uncle Arthur,” she burst out, “surely you can’t mean to do this\r\nterrible thing. Why, I don’t love Mr. Beebe at all. I scarcely know him,\r\nand I don’t want to marry anyone.”\r\n\r\n“My dear niece,” replied Ward evenly, “love has no part in my scheme of\r\nthings. Hate rules the world, and hate is my creed. Love makes people\r\nsoft and indolent. Hate is the great inspirator. Hate makes the world go\r\n’round.\r\n\r\n“Sentiment has no place whatever in this marriage. It is entirely a\r\nmarriage of convenience. Your personal inclinations have no weight\r\nwhatever. I wish you to marry Beebe; therefore you will do it.”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s color had heightened as she listened to her uncle’s ultimatum.\r\nAs he finished, a grim expression of defiance settled on his face.\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t!” she answered crisply.\r\n\r\n“As you will, Virginia, but if you do not consent to marry Beebe within\r\ntwenty-four hours I shall leave you here alone with him. I imagine after\r\na couple of weeks of that you’ll be quite willing to marry him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you beast!” For an instant, as Ward’s full meaning became clear to\r\nher, it looked as though the girl would faint.\r\n\r\nThen, like a wild beast at bay, she turned on Beebe in a burst of blazing\r\nfury.\r\n\r\n“And you, Larson Beebe, what have you to say? Are you going to be a party\r\nto this? Are you as much a beast as my uncle?”\r\n\r\nBeebe regarded her tolerantly for a moment out of his piggish eyes before\r\nhe spoke. A catlike smile of satisfaction curved his lips. He answered\r\nslowly, indolently:\r\n\r\n“Virginia, I am wild about you. I want you, and I am going to have you.\r\nAs long as you refuse to love me I’m not at all particular how I get you.\r\nOne way suits me as well as another.”\r\n\r\nThe girl turned back to her uncle. Her hands went out in an imploring\r\ngesture. For an instant she seemed about to plead. Then she evidently\r\nthought better of it.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you understand, Uncle Arthur,” she asked in a low cold voice,\r\n“that I will kill myself before I will let this happen?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Virginia, you do not seem to understand the situation at all.\r\nYou are absolutely in my power. You cannot kill yourself because I will\r\nnot permit it. I will not give you the chance. You will do exactly as I\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“_Not yet, Ward! First, you’ll settle with me!_”\r\n\r\nStanley Ross stood in the doorway. But it was not the Stanley Ross,\r\nurbane, bored, carefree, who, a few days before, had whimsically sought\r\nadventure up an unknown canon trail. He had found adventure now, and it\r\nhad used him roughly. His face and hands were grimy. His clothes were\r\ndirty and torn. One sleeve had been almost rent from his shoulder. His\r\nhair was riotously disheveled and clotted with blood. Down one side of\r\nhis face extended a great splash of dirty dried blood.\r\n\r\nIn his right hand was an ugly-looking automatic, and in his face and eyes\r\nwas a look of savage fury.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of Ross’s voice, Ward whirled and whipped out a gun. But\r\nhe was too late, for Ross, with a steadiness and coldness belied by\r\nthe savagery of his face and figure, had fired. A look of unutterable\r\namazement overspread the face of Arthur Ward. He wavered on his feet for\r\na moment, and then, when a spot of red began to widen on his shirt front,\r\nhe toppled backward, lifeless.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same instant a hatchet hurtled through the room and buried\r\nits blade deep in the wall beside Larson Beebe, missing his head by\r\nthe merest fraction of an inch. Wong was going into action. Beebe slid\r\nforward from his seat and ducked to temporary safety behind the table.\r\n\r\nWard had not had time to aim, but he had instinctively pulled the\r\ntrigger. The bullet caught Ross on the head and cut a long shallow furrow\r\njust above his left temple. The wound itself was not serious, but for a\r\nmoment it blinded Ross. That moment was fatal, for as he roused himself\r\nfrom the shock he knew that he had forgotten Poole.\r\n\r\nInstantly Ross whirled to face the other doorway, but was too late. The\r\nheavy bullet spun him half around. For an instant he fought to retain his\r\nbalance. Then he pitched forward onto the floor.\r\n\r\nPainfully, with almost a superhuman effort, Ross raised himself with one\r\nhand and deliberately shot Poole through the chest.\r\n\r\nThen, mercifully, consciousness was blotted out.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER NINE_\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA EXPLAINS\r\n\r\nWhen Ross returned to consciousness it was to a blurred, feverish,\r\npain-wracked world.\r\n\r\nHe did not know where he was or what had happened. He only knew that his\r\nhead was bandaged and splitting with pain; that his shoulder was stiff\r\nand sore, incapable of being moved even the fraction of an inch, and that\r\nit pained with a dull, throbbing hurt; that his eyes burned and blurred;\r\nand that his entire body burned with ten thousand fires.\r\n\r\nOf one thing more was Ross conscious. That was the girl. When she saw\r\nthat Ross had temporarily come out of the fog she hurried to his side and\r\nanswered the unasked question on his lips by holding a cup of cold water\r\nto them. She seemed to have been waiting for ages to do just that.\r\n\r\nRoss drank gratefully, but when he would have questioned her she laid her\r\nfinger across his lips and said;\r\n\r\n“_Sh-h-h-ush!_ Not now. We’ll talk when you feel better. Just now you\r\nneed sleep more than anything else.”\r\n\r\nAnd Stanley Ross obeyed. In an instant he was asleep, a wild, feverish\r\nsleep that brought no rest.\r\n\r\nThere followed days of half consciousness, half nightmare; days when Ross\r\nneither knew nor cared what happened, when wild delirium alternated with\r\npainful reality.\r\n\r\nHe was far too ill to make any inquiries about anything that had\r\nhappened. In fact, he was only conscious of the fact that whenever the\r\nfog lifted the girl always seemed to be present—a ministering angel who\r\nbrought cooling draughts, and soothing applications for his head and\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nFinally there came a day when Ross awoke to a sane world. The fever fog\r\nhad departed from his brain. His head no longer throbbed and beat like\r\na thousand devils. His shoulder was sore and stiff, but it no longer\r\nwas filled with maddening pain. He was weak, very weak, but the world\r\nwas once more interesting and he was acutely aware of a most prodigious\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nRoss was aware that he was in the room to which he had been conducted\r\nby Garfin on the night of the strange dinner. Beyond that, he was not\r\ninterested. He was aware that the girl was still acting as his nurse.\r\n\r\nAt meal time the Chinese, Wong, came in with a tray. He was still too\r\nweak to care as to the whereabouts of the others, or what had happened on\r\nthe night of the fight.\r\n\r\nHe did learn that the girl’s name was Virginia Carver, but that was all.\r\n\r\nIn less than a week he was sitting out on the long veranda every\r\nafternoon. With returning strength came returning curiosity. He wanted to\r\nknow the story of this strange habitation in the desert and to learn just\r\nwhat had happened on the night Wong had aided him to escape.\r\n\r\nSeveral times he broached the subject to the girl, but each time she put\r\nhim off with the statement that he was not yet strong enough to talk. The\r\nexcuse was obviously becoming threadbare, however, as his health improved.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, while Ross was sitting on the veranda, the girl came\r\nout and took a seat opposite him. It was patent that the time for\r\nexplanations had come.\r\n\r\n“I suppose, Mr. Ross,” began Virginia Carver, “that you have been\r\nwondering just what this whole thing is about, and you certainly are\r\nentitled to an explanation. I don’t know how I am ever going to thank you\r\nfor what you have done for me. You were very brave.”\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose you forget about the thanks, Miss Carver,” said Ross,\r\nvisibly embarrassed. “I _would_ like to know all about this queer affair,\r\nthough. I thought Arabian Nights were ancient history, but I’m about\r\nready to believe anything.”\r\n\r\n“In order for you to understand I’ll have to take you back about seven\r\nyears,” explained the girl. “At that time my uncle, Arthur Ward, was one\r\nof the biggest operators in Wall Street. All his life he has been a very\r\npeculiar man; eccentric; always doing queer things for which there seemed\r\nno explanation, and never taking any one into his confidence.\r\n\r\n“In the Street he was known as a plunger. He made a great deal of money.\r\nJust how much I have no idea beyond the fact that he was always very\r\ngenerous with my mother, his sister. But at one time he must have been\r\nvery wealthy indeed.\r\n\r\n“Seven years ago it seems that he plunged too heavily and got caught.\r\nHis fortune was practically wiped out. When everything was settled up he\r\nwas still a wealthy man—that is, he was probably worth a half million\r\ndollars—but the great bulk of his fortune was gone.\r\n\r\n“He fought fiercely to keep from going under. There were days and nights\r\nat a time when I don’t think he slept at all. He was like a wild man, but\r\nthe combination against him was too great and he went under.\r\n\r\n“At first we thought he was going to lose his mind. For weeks he acted\r\nvery queer. Finally he seemed to get a hold on himself and he appeared\r\nrational.\r\n\r\n“He settled up his business, and then suddenly disappeared. He left no\r\nword where he was going—just dropped out of sight. That was seven years\r\nago, and for two years we heard nothing from him. Five years ago I got a\r\nletter from him asking me to visit him here. I came and found things just\r\nabout as you see them now.\r\n\r\n“He seemed perfectly rational and contented. Of course, he was queer and\r\nerratic, but he had always been that. He seemed to have forgotten Wall\r\nStreet entirely and spent most of his time making a collection of the\r\naccoutrements of horse and man of the old-time West. I doubt if there is\r\na finer collection in existence.\r\n\r\n“He did a lot of entertaining, too, for his old friends, inviting them\r\nout for long visits. Here his eccentricity cropped out, for he insisted\r\non going to great lengths to have everything just as it would be in New\r\nYork. There must be fifteen dress suits in the house, and he always asked\r\nevery one to dress for dinner. He imported wines and foods. Wong has been\r\nwith him ever since he has been here and he is an excellent cook.\r\n\r\n“I came out every year. He was always very kind to me and has made every\r\neffort to entertain me. I thought he acted a little more queer each year,\r\nand I often wondered if he was not a little unbalanced mentally.\r\n\r\n“When I came out this year there was a great change. I saw at once\r\nthat he was quite mad. He imagined that he was being persecuted by the\r\nWarings, and kept Poole and Garfin, New York gunmen, to protect him.\r\nThe Warings were the people who engineered his defeat in Wall Street,\r\nand Uncle Arthur hated them intensely. He not only imagined they were\r\npersecuting him, but he also imagined that the younger Waring, whom I\r\nhave never seen, was trying to marry me. This seemed to be an obsession\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n“When I got here I found that Larson Beebe was Uncle Arthur’s guest. I\r\nhad met Mr. Beebe in New York several times, and I detested him. I had\r\ngood reason to. He—well, I have always despised him.\r\n\r\n“Just what his hold or influence on Uncle Arthur was I haven’t the\r\nslightest idea, but I had hardly arrived before Uncle Arthur began to\r\ninsist that I marry him.\r\n\r\n“Of course, I refused, and it was then that Uncle Arthur’s insanity came\r\nto the surface. He had always been kindness itself, but now he suddenly\r\nbecame the very incarnation of cruelty. While there was no question but\r\nthat he was entirely mad, yet in his madness his brain was as shrewd and\r\ncunning as ever.\r\n\r\n“When I refused to marry Beebe he began to practice his cruelties on me\r\nin an effort to break my will. I was utterly at his mercy, for there was\r\nno way that I could escape. All I could do was submit.\r\n\r\n“The culmination of his indignities was to chain me to the rocks where\r\nyou found me. Whether he would have left me there till I was dead I\r\nhardly know, but I think not. His brain was so unbalanced that it would\r\nbe hard to tell.\r\n\r\n“I ran away that night because I knew he would kill you if he found\r\nyou with me. Evidently he had Garfin watching me, or he would not have\r\nlearned that you had released me. He was obsessed with the idea that you\r\nwere the younger Waring.\r\n\r\n“The rest of the story you know. I dare not think of what would have\r\nhappened to me if you had not come to my rescue, Mr. Ross.”\r\n\r\n“But what really happened the night I escaped?” asked Ross.\r\n\r\n“Well—you shot both Uncle Arthur and Poole,” she replied hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“Did I—did I—” he floundered helplessly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied evenly. “Providence helped your aim that night. Wong\r\nburied them both. No, Mr. Ross,” she finished, as she noted the look on\r\nhis face, “don’t feel that way about it. If you hadn’t killed them they\r\nwould have killed you, and I would have suffered a fate worse than death.\r\nUnder the circumstances I cannot feel sorry.”\r\n\r\n“What happened to Beebe?” asked Ross, curious as to the fate of that\r\ndubious individual.\r\n\r\n“That’s a mystery. He simply disappeared that night and we have not seen\r\nhim since. Wong just barely missed him that night with a hatchet. I think\r\nhe is deathly afraid of Wong. At any rate, he is gone. And now, Mr. Ross,\r\nI want to ask you a question: How did you manage to escape from your\r\nprison that night? Wong won’t tell me a thing. He just grins when I ask\r\nhim, and I suspect I owe a great deal to Wong.”\r\n\r\n“You surely do, Miss Carver,” answered Ross fervently. “That Chinaman is\r\na wonder. In some way he got hold of my automatic and cartridge belt. He\r\npassed them to me through the window, and then, under some pretense, got\r\nGarfin to come and open the door. Then—well, Garfin won’t ever bother us\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER TEN_\r\n\r\nA NEW DANGER\r\n\r\nWith the passing days, Ross found new strength and new interest. His\r\nhead was already healed and his shoulder, beyond being stiff, no longer\r\nbothered him. While still somewhat weak, he was able to walk about as he\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nHe found it very pleasant to pass the afternoons away on the long\r\nveranda. Here he was often joined by Virginia Carver, and the two spent\r\nhours together that were very pleasant. In fact, Ross suddenly became\r\nacutely aware that he was taking more than a passing interest in this\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nVirginia Carver was exceedingly lovely. Moreover, she was of a type and\r\npersonality that particularly appealed to Stanley Ross. While she was\r\nnursing him through his illness he had found her presence very pleasing.\r\nNow that he was nearly well, her companionship was becoming even more\r\ndelightful, and he realized that, as far as he was concerned, friendship\r\nwas ripening into something more definite. As he continued to improve he\r\nknew that the time was fast approaching when they would have to leave\r\nthis desert oasis.\r\n\r\nHe found his mind continually recurring to Larson Beebe. How had he\r\nmanaged to disappear so completely that night? Where had he gone? What\r\nwas he doing now? Ross could not dismiss the idea that they would hear\r\nfrom Beebe again, and that when they did it would mean trouble.\r\n\r\nThis conviction was the more firmly fixed in his mind by the actions of\r\nVirginia Carver. Ross felt sure that the girl was deeply worried over\r\nsomething; she seemed anxious and nervous; she appeared to be continually\r\nwatching and listening for something. Intuition told Ross that the cause\r\nof her perturbation was Beebe.\r\n\r\nIntuition again told him that perhaps Wong could throw some light on the\r\nsituation. The next time that the Chinese appeared on the veranda Ross\r\nstopped him.\r\n\r\n“Wong,” he said, “Miss Carver seems to be worried about something. Do you\r\nknow what it is? Is it about Beebe? Do you know where he is?”\r\n\r\nWong’s face betrayed not a single glimmer of comprehension.\r\n\r\n“No savvy,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you do savvy, too. What’s wrong here? Where’s Beebe?”\r\n\r\nWong glanced hurriedly up and down the veranda as though he feared some\r\none would overhear him. Then he jerked a meaning finger toward the mouth\r\nof the little canon.\r\n\r\n“Him there,” he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Him hide in canon. Kill all we go out.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t have to go out that way.”\r\n\r\n“No other way can go,” explained Wong.\r\n\r\n“What! You mean to tell me that’s the only way out of this place? Why\r\ncan’t we go out over the cliffs?”\r\n\r\n“No can do,” replied the Chinese, and was gone before Ross could question\r\nhim further.\r\n\r\nSo that was it! The canon was the only way out of the basin, and Beebe\r\nwas hiding down there, waiting to pot them as they came out. Quite a neat\r\nlittle idea! So that was why Virginia Carver was carrying that worried\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nRoss went straight to the girl. He found her in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n“Miss Carver,” he asked, “why didn’t you tell me that Beebe was down in\r\nthat canon?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I couldn’t see any use worrying you with that while you were so\r\nill,” she replied, smiling. “And then, too, Mr. Ross, I think you are a\r\nlittle inclined to do impulsive things, and it seems to me you have ran\r\nrisks enough on my account.”\r\n\r\nRoss ignored this last.\r\n\r\n“Then he really is there?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Ross, he is, and I am afraid that we are in rather a bad way.\r\nHe has all the advantage.”\r\n\r\n“But isn’t there any way out of this place except through that canon?”\r\n\r\n“None at all. Uncle Arthur selected this place for that very reason.\r\nThere was a trail up the cliff, but he dynamited that away. Unless we\r\ndevelop wings we’ll go out through that canon or not at all.”\r\n\r\nRoss pondered for a moment. Finally he asked, “I wonder why he hasn’t\r\ntried to kill Wong and me at night?”\r\n\r\n“There are at least two reasons, I think,” answered the girl. “The first\r\nis that Larson Beebe is a very cautious man. He will not risk a single\r\nhair of his head if it is not necessary. If he came up here he might get\r\nhurt. If he stays there he is perfectly safe and we haven’t a single\r\nchance of getting by.\r\n\r\n“Another thing, I think he is deathly afraid of Wong. He came up in the\r\nnight twice and stole provisions. Since then Wong has been watching. I\r\ndon’t think he ever sleeps.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we can outlast him anyway, Miss Carver.”\r\n\r\n“But that’s just what we can’t do, Mr. Ross. Our provisions are very\r\nlow.” The girl was gravely serious now. “Unless we can find some\r\nsolution, I’m afraid he is going to starve us out very soon. It looks\r\nlike we were trapped.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER ELEVEN_\r\n\r\nWONG HAS AN IDEA\r\n\r\nRoss woke the next morning keenly aware of the seriousness of their\r\npredicament. As soon as breakfast was over he set out to examine the\r\nwalls of the basin.\r\n\r\nIf he had any hope that there was a means of escape over the cliffs he\r\nwas soon disillusioned. Nowhere was there a break in the walls. They were\r\nas perpendicular as a plumb-line and as smooth as basalt. Nothing but a\r\nfly could have scaled those cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe only way out led through the narrow twisting canon below. And there\r\nLarson Beebe lay in wait like a cat at a rat-hole. Ross realized that\r\nthere was little or no chance for him or Wong to get through the canon\r\nalive. Beebe had all the advantage.\r\n\r\nRoss returned to the house and sat down on the veranda. He ran over a\r\ndozen possible schemes for escape, and in the end he had to conclude that\r\nthey were all impossible.\r\n\r\nIn fact, his only conclusion was that he would give what fortune he\r\npossessed to have Larson Beebe’s neck within the grasp of his two hands.\r\nThat, however, seemed to be a remote possibility. If anything, the\r\nsituation would be reversed.\r\n\r\nRoss had about exhausted his whole range of impossible schemes when Wong\r\nappeared on the veranda. The Chinese wore an enigmatical smile on his\r\nusually inscrutable face. It was patent that he was well pleased with\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n“You come,” he addressed Ross. “Got something show.”\r\n\r\nRoss rose and followed Wong, who led the way to one of the ’dobe\r\noutbuildings. Opening the door, he motioned Ross to enter.\r\n\r\nThe room was a work-shop of sorts, but what instantly attracted attention\r\nwere two enormous kites leaning against the wall.\r\n\r\n“You see?” inquired Wong.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I see,” said Ross, “only I don’t. What’s the idea, Wong?”\r\n\r\n“Mlisha Beebe kill everybody we go down canon. No can climb out. Wong\r\nmake klite. Klite climb out.”\r\n\r\n“Guess I’m pretty thick, Wong. I don’t get it yet.”\r\n\r\n“When Wong little bloy China he fly many klites. Not forget how. Fly\r\nklite now. Klite lift lope top cliff. We climb lope. Go ’way.”\r\n\r\n“By George, Wong, I believe you’ve got it,” cried Ross in admiration.\r\n“But will it work?”\r\n\r\n“Can do” nodded Wong.\r\n\r\n“But how will you fasten the rope at the top of the cliff, Wong?”\r\n\r\n“Wong good klite flyer. Two klites lift big loop. Drop loop over tree\r\ntop side cliff. Two ends hang dlown. Mlake slip knot. Pull one lope. All\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\n“Wong, you’re a wonder! I believe it’ll work. Worth trying anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Can do. Try tomollow if wind come.”\r\n\r\nRoss hurried away to find Virginia Carver.\r\n\r\n“Miss Carver,” he hailed her joyously, “Wong has got a scheme to get us\r\nout of here, and I believe it will work. He has constructed two enormous\r\nkites down there in the workshop. He claims they will lift a rope, and\r\nhe says he can drop it over one of those stunted pines at the top of the\r\ncliff. We climb the rope and leave friend Beebe down in the canon to hold\r\nthe bag. Are you game?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I am,” replied the girl, surprised that he should even\r\nquestion her gameness.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would be. We’re going to try it tomorrow. You had better make\r\ntwo packs of food.”\r\n\r\n“Two packs? Don’t I carry anything?” asked the girl.\r\n\r\n“Miss Carver,” said Ross gravely, “it’s a long way to civilization, and\r\nit is going to be a big tax on your strength to make it without carrying\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll make it,” said Virginia Carver, as she turned away.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Ross was eager for the experiment, but it was\r\nnearly noon before a breeze came up strong enough to lift the kites.\r\n\r\nVirginia Carver came out, clad in flannel shirt, whipcord breeches and\r\nhigh laced boots. It was a costume well suited to the work ahead, but it\r\naccentuated the girl’s slimness, made her appear almost frail. There was\r\nno frailty there, though. Rather was she supple with the suppleness of a\r\nbraided cable, and the girl had the grace of a fine Toledo blade. Once\r\nagain Stanley Ross became acutely aware that Virginia Carver had become\r\nan exceedingly important interest in his life.\r\n\r\nWong had instructed Ross in his scheme for escape. Ross saw at once that\r\nhe had not intended to lift a rope heavy enough to hold a human being.\r\nInstead Wong had unearthed from one of the storehouses a very stout light\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to lift the bight of the line with the two kites and drop\r\nit over a stunted pine growing out at an angle near the top of the north\r\ncliff. A heavier rope could then be attached to one end of this and drawn\r\nup and over the tree, making it possible to climb out.\r\n\r\nRoss saw instantly that the plan was all right if the kites could be\r\nmanipulated. That was Wong’s job, and he seemed quite confident.\r\n\r\nAll three knew that they must work quickly. If Larson Beebe discovered\r\ntheir scheme there was no telling what desperate action he might attempt.\r\n\r\nWong and Ross quickly got the first big kite into action. It rose\r\nreadily, but on attaining a height of fifty feet flopped drunkenly. It\r\ndid not fall, however—merely dipped and darted. This did not appear to\r\nbother Wong at all. He simply gave the kite string to Virginia Carver to\r\nhold while he quickly flew the second kite with Ross’s help.\r\n\r\nWong and Ross each took command of a kite now. Slowly paying out cord,\r\nthey allowed the kites to rise. When the kites had risen to a height\r\nof about seventy-five feet the cords attached to the bight of the line\r\nsuddenly became taut and the line began to rise from the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Ross saw that as a designer of kites Wong most\r\nemphatically knew his business, for the instant the weight of the\r\nline was borne by the kites in that instant they ceased their drunken\r\nplungings and flew steadily.\r\n\r\nRoss’s heart leaped within him, for he knew now that Wong’s scheme would\r\nwork and that they were going to circumvent Larson Beebe. Up, up, the\r\nkites rose. A hundred feet! Two hundred! Five! A thousand!\r\n\r\nThe two kites were about thirty feet apart, and when it was obvious that\r\nthe line was higher than the cliff wall Wong and Ross began to walk\r\nslowly forward. Their objective was a single low pine growing at an\r\noutward angle near the top of the cliff. Aiming carefully at this, Wong\r\nand Ross brought the kites to a position where an end of the line dangled\r\non each side of the tree and against the cliff. The bight of the line was\r\nslightly above the tree, and the kites were pulling it forward.\r\n\r\n“Missee, you grab ropes,” shouted Wong.\r\n\r\nQuickly divining what was wanted of her, Virginia Carver grasped the ends\r\nof the dangling lines.\r\n\r\n“Let glo!” shouted Wong again.\r\n\r\nInstantly he and Ross released the kite cords. The kites plunged\r\ndrunkenly down out of sight over the top of the cliff. The bight of the\r\nline dropped neatly over the pine tree and slid down its trunk to the\r\nroots. The thing was done!\r\n\r\nRoss wanted to shout for pure joy. Elation showed in Virginia Carver’s\r\nevery feature. As for Wong, the author of this daring scheme, he merely\r\ngrinned, and went swiftly to work.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in one of the buildings Wong had discovered a coil of light\r\nrope. It had undoubtedly been brought in to be made up into lariats, for\r\nit was very pliable and exceedingly strong—strong enough to support the\r\nweight of a heavy man.\r\n\r\nOne end of this was fastened to a free end of the line over the tree.\r\nWhen Wong pulled sharply on the opposite end of the smaller line it\r\nslipped readily over the tree trunk. In a minute or two the end of the\r\nrope had been pulled up over the tree trunk and back to the canon floor.\r\nThus was the light line replaced by the heavier one.\r\n\r\nThere was no place to anchor one of the rope ends so Wong simply tied a\r\nloop in one end of the rope, passed the other end through it, making a\r\nrunning noose, and quickly ran it up to the tree. Wong’s kites had proved\r\ntheir worth. The means of escape was provided and ready.\r\n\r\n“Wong go first,” said the Chinese. Without argument or permission, the\r\nintrepid Wong was assuming the risk of proving the safety of the rope. By\r\nway of explanation he added to Ross, “You shoulda no stlong. No can pull\r\nMissee up, Wong can do.”\r\n\r\nWong grasped the rope in his hands, and with the agility of a cat,\r\nfeet on the canon wall, passed himself, hand over hand, up the face of\r\nthe cliff. It seemed hardly a minute before he was at the top and had\r\nscrambled over the edge.\r\n\r\nIn a moment his head reappeared and he called down to Ross to send up the\r\nfood packs, canteens, and blankets. This was but the work of a moment,\r\nand Wong quickly drew them to the top.\r\n\r\nSo far everything had gone well, and there was no sign of Beebe. It\r\nlooked as though they were going to make good their escape.\r\n\r\nWhen Wong let the rope down again Ross fashioned a loop in the end of it,\r\nwhich he passed over Virginia Carver’s head and secured it under her arms.\r\n\r\n“Now, Miss Carver, if you will take hold of the rope with both hands I\r\nthink Wong can pull you up safely,” he said. “If you hit against the\r\ncliff push yourself away with your feet.”\r\n\r\nThe girl did not answer him, but she smiled confidently. She accepted her\r\npart in the escape with what appealed to Stanley Ross as being splendid\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nSlowly but very steadily, Wong began to raise the girl. The little\r\nChinese seemed to be made of steel, for, without stopping once or\r\nincreasing or decreasing the speed, he drew Virginia Carver to the top\r\nof the cliff and helped her over the edge. It was a feat of which a man\r\ntwice his size might have been justly proud.\r\n\r\nWhen the rope came down again Ross lost no time. A hasty glance toward\r\nthe mouth of the tiny canon revealed no sight of Beebe. Grasping the\r\nrope, Ross began his ascent.\r\n\r\nHis shoulder bothered him somewhat, but it was not more than two or three\r\nminutes before he, too, was at the cliff top.\r\n\r\nThey were free!\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER TWELVE_\r\n\r\nAN ENDING AND A BEGINNING\r\n\r\nStanley Ross drew himself over the edge of the cliff, where Virginia\r\nCarver and Wong were waiting, and scrambled to his feet. He was exuberant.\r\n\r\n“Well, Miss Carver, I guess we’re safe all right, thanks to Wong here,”\r\nhe exulted. “All that remains now is to make tracks away from this\r\naccursed place.”\r\n\r\n“So you think you’re safe, eh?” snarled a cold voice.\r\n\r\nRoss whirled to find himself facing Larson Beebe. Beebe was covering him\r\nsteadily with a big automatic, and his deep set, piggish eyes had an\r\ninsane light in them.\r\n\r\nRoss’s heart sank within him. He had expected an attack from Beebe from\r\nbelow, but that he might be waiting for them on the cliff top never\r\nentered his head. He was utterly helpless now. Beebe had the drop on him\r\nand could kill him twice over before he could draw his own gun. Moreover,\r\nit was certain Beebe intended doing that very thing.\r\n\r\nRoss was filled with a sense of futility, impotency. That he was about\r\nto die he did not consider. He was merely disgusted with himself for\r\nallowing himself to be checkmated when the game was practically won.\r\n\r\n“So you thought you could get away?” Beebe was going on. It was obvious\r\nthat he, too, was nearly insane. “Thought I was asleep, eh? I knew what\r\nwas up as soon as I saw the kites. I could have got you then, but I\r\nfigured the easiest and safest way would be to slip up here and wait\r\nbehind a rock till you were all up. You wouldn’t be looking for me and I\r\ncould pot you easily. Well, I’m here and you’re due for a long journey.\r\n\r\n“Thought you could outwit Larson Beebe, eh? I’m just going to shoot you\r\nand your precious Chink friend here now and kick you over the cliff. Then\r\nI’m going to take Virginia and——.”\r\n\r\nRoss was conscious that Wong’s right hand whipped to the base of his\r\nskull just above the collar of his blouse. In the same instant it came\r\naway again and now it held a long, thin, slender glittering blade!\r\n\r\nThere was another movement of Wong’s hand so swift that he could not\r\nfollow it. Ross only knew that a look of utterably blank amazement had\r\noverspread Larson Beebe’s face. It was as though Beebe had seen a miracle\r\nperformed before his eyes and could not fathom it.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, Ross saw what had happened. The hilt of the knife that\r\nWong had held was protruding from Larson Beebe’s ribs!\r\n\r\nFor an instant Beebe wavered on his feet. His fingers relaxed and his gun\r\nclattered to the rocks. He pitched forward onto his face.\r\n\r\n“Can do,” muttered Wong. “One day kick Wong. Not kick again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night the three camped beside a little water-hole several miles\r\ndown the main canon. Around the tiny campfire they made their plans for\r\ngetting out of the desert.\r\n\r\nRoss knew the general direction to take, and he felt confident that\r\nby taking it easy the girl would be able to make the journey on foot.\r\nVirginia Carver was confident.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Ross was awakened by footsteps on the rocks. He\r\nraised up to see two long-eared animals making their way down the trail\r\nto the water-hole. It was Archibald and Percy!\r\n\r\nRoss let out a shout that instantly roused his companions.\r\n\r\n“There’s your ship of the desert that’s going to carry you back to\r\ncivilization,” he called, as Virginia raised up from her blankets.\r\n\r\nThe girl did not comprehend. She gazed at the two animals in astonishment\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\n“But they’re wild, aren’t they?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Just as wild as two snails,” said Ross. “Those two estimable gentlemen\r\nbrought me into this desert, and they’re going to take us out.”\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast had been finished Ross noticed that Wong was busily\r\nengaged in rearranging the weight of the packs.\r\n\r\n“Never mind the packs, Wong. Friend Archibald here can carry Miss Carver\r\nand Percy can handle the supplies. You and I will go light, Wong,” Ross\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n“No can do,” replied Wong. “Me no go you.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Wong?”\r\n\r\n“Wong go that way,” answered the Chinese, pointing to the south.\r\n\r\n“You go that way,” asked Ross, perplexed. “Why? You’re going with Miss\r\nCarver and me.”\r\n\r\nWong shook his head. “Wong kill man. Think not stay in ’Nited States. Go\r\nMexiclo.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Wong,” said Ross. “Miss Carver and I can easily fix that.”\r\n\r\n“Think not. Wong go Mexiclo. Got blother there. Buy li’le res’rant.”\r\n\r\nRoss saw that there was no use in trying to dissuade Wong. There was no\r\ncombating such a nature. After a few moments Ross asked:\r\n\r\n“Wong, where you going in Mexico?”\r\n\r\n“Go Wa’lz.”\r\n\r\n“Going to Juarez, eh? What’s your full name?”\r\n\r\n“Name? Wong Chen Chek.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Wong. In about two months you go to the postoffice and\r\ninquire for a registered package. You’ll find enough money in it to buy\r\nthe best little restaurant in Juarez.”\r\n\r\nWong grinned. “Thlank you.”\r\n\r\nSwinging his pack to his shoulder, he swung down the trail without more\r\nado.\r\n\r\n“Goo’ bye. Goo’ bye, Missee,” came back to Ross and Virginia Carver.\r\n\r\nA half hour later the Chinese disappeared from view far down the canon.\r\nRoss turned to the girl.\r\n\r\nVirginia Carver was gazing far out over the jumble of rocks and sand that\r\nis the Red Desert to where the mists of the morning were dissolving into\r\nthe shifting haze of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Ross watched her without speaking. Fresh and vibrant with\r\nyouth, she was lovely beyond words.\r\n\r\n“I guess we had best be going now,” he said. Then his voice stumbled,\r\n“Miss Carver—Virginia—when we get out of here—I’ve—I’ve something to say\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nFor a long moment the girl continued to look far into the colorful haze\r\nof the desert. Then she turned toward Ross. A peculiarly tender little\r\nsmile wreathed her mouth. Her eyes were swimming pools of unshed tears.\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered, “Would—would you mind—saying it now—Stanley?”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago Man Attacked by Fighting Owl\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Casey, night watchman for the Chicago Protective Agency, while\r\n“walking his beat” one night recently, entered a dark passageway in West\r\nMadison Street; and then, all at once—\r\n\r\n“Something flew at me from the darkness,” he said later, “and knocked\r\nmy cap off and began scratching my face and clawing out my hair by the\r\nroots. I made a pass at it, but found I was fanning the air. Then I\r\nsaw two blazing eyes, and struck at them. Before I could get out my\r\ngun the monster jumped on me again. I managed to swing on it with my\r\nnight-stick—and that ended the fight.”\r\n\r\nTo substantiate his story, Watchman Casey exhibited a dead owl measuring\r\nthirty-six inches from tip to tip, also numerous cuts and bruises on his\r\nhands and face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Powerful Novel of Sinister Madmen That Mounts To An Astounding Climax_\r\n\r\nThe Jailer of Souls\r\n\r\n_Complete In This Issue_\r\n\r\n_By_ HAMILTON CRAIGIE\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER ONE_\r\n\r\nSOUTHWEST OF THE LAW\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll the way Westward in the smoker the man in the high-crowned, black\r\nStetson had taken no part in the conversation. He had appeared to doze,\r\nslumping in the high-backed seat as the train rushed onward into the\r\ngolden afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe three men at his back had been busy with an interminable round of\r\npoker: draw, jack-pot, and stud; deuces wild, and seven-card peak. They\r\nmoved across the aisle now, as the long train slowed for the brief stop\r\nat Two-Horse Canyon, facing him obliquely and a little to his left.\r\n\r\nTwice or thrice they had essayed to draw him into the talk, but\r\nthe man in the black Stetson had been oblivious; he had continued\r\ntaciturn—morose, almost, one might have said. But he had not been asleep;\r\nrather, he had listened with all his ears as their voices had reached him\r\nbetween hands:\r\n\r\n“... Yes—Dry Bone—been there myself—they run things pretty much to\r\nsuit _themselves_.... Wide-open.... Sure.... You might call it a dead\r\nopen-and-shut proposition, I’ll tell a man!”\r\n\r\nThe laugh that followed had come to the man in the black Stetson with a\r\ncurious, grating note:\r\n\r\n“Sure-thing gamblers; con-men—it’s a regular crook’s paradise.... And\r\nthere’s that fellow, Rook....”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the man in the black Stetson narrowed abruptly at the\r\ncorners; for a moment, as a curtain is drawn swiftly from right to left,\r\nsomething arose to peer out of those eyes, glowing, deep-down, like a\r\nstill, festering flame. But it was gone upon the instant—\r\n\r\n“... And there’s that fellow, Rook....” the man had said.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden he had stopped short as if he had been muzzled; presently his\r\nvoice had come again, dry, matter-of-fact:\r\n\r\n“I’ll see that raise, Carpenter, and it’ll cost you just twenty iron men\r\nto call....”\r\n\r\nPlainly, that name, “Rook,” had been taboo; the speaker had been silently\r\nreminded of it.\r\n\r\nThe man in the black Stetson—he had been known as Black Steve Annister\r\nin the back blocks at Wooloomooloof before he had made of that name a\r\nby-word in the honkatonks and the gambling-hells from San Francisco\r\nnorthward to the Wind River country, and beyond it—Black Steve Annister\r\nwas sitting upright now, but he had retired behind a wide-spread copy of\r\nthe _Durango County Gazette_. He was not reading it, however, although he\r\nwas looking through it—at the three men just across the aisle, studying\r\nthem through the pin-pricks he had made in it, himself unseen.\r\n\r\nAnnister had arrived in New York only the week previous from Sourabaya,\r\nJava, and he had not waited even overnight before he had begun the long\r\njourney, broken at Washington for half a day, which had taken him now\r\nhalf way southwestward across the State of Texas. Presently the long\r\ntrain would cross the Pecos, beyond it the serrated ramparts of the\r\nGuadalupes; Dry Bone was just between.\r\n\r\nAnnister, studying the men, frowned abruptly, yawning behind his hand.\r\nTwo of the men he put down for ranchers—sheep men, probably; there was\r\nabout them none of the glamor of that West which lingers even now in the\r\nperson of a cattleman; and these men were negligible.\r\n\r\nBut the third man would have been noticeable anywhere. He was a bull’s\r\nbulk of a man, hard-featured, mouth a straight gash above a heavy chin\r\nbarbered to the blood; the observer across the aisle would have said\r\n“cowman,” and registered a bull’s eye with it, point-blank.\r\n\r\nThe two who were with him, evidently with interests in common, were\r\nscarcely friendly with the cowman, if such he was; it was evident in\r\ntheir attitude, the constraint which had fallen upon them following that\r\nmention of “Rook.”\r\n\r\nBut the man in the black Stetson continued to study the big fellow\r\nthrough the holes in his newspaper: the hard face, tanned a rich\r\nsaddle color; the nose, flattened to a smudge of flaring nostril; the\r\ncauliflower ear.\r\n\r\nHe had heard the name, “Ellison” once or twice; somewhere, deep down, it\r\nhad set vibrating a chord of memory that brought with it, incongruously\r\nenough, an altogether different setting: a padded ring under twin,\r\nblazing arcs; the thud and shuffle of sliding feet; a man, huge, brutish,\r\nbroad, fists like stone mauls, yet, for all his bulk, a very cat for\r\nquickness....\r\n\r\nHe put down his paper now—to find those hard eyes boring into his.\r\nEllison, or whatever the man’s name was, had shifted in his seat; the\r\nglance that he turned now upon the stranger in the black Stetson was\r\nsearching, probing. There was a truculence in it, a fierce, bright,\r\navid staring, like an animal’s, savage in its very directness, like a\r\nchallenge—which in effect it was.\r\n\r\nAnnister returned the look, eye for eye, with a bitter, brooding\r\ninsolence in which there was apparent a certain mockery, his eyes in a\r\nveiled gleaming, like the sun on water. For a long moment their glances\r\nengaged, in a silent duel, like rapier points; then the giant with the\r\ncauliflower ear vented a sound between a grunt and a snort, turning to\r\nthe window, his gaze outward across the flat levels of the adjacent\r\nprairie in a kind of sightless stare.\r\n\r\nThere had been no reason in it—no logic—that Annister could see, but for\r\nthe moment he had owned to a sudden sense of crisis; it had seemed to him\r\nfor a moment that in the giant’s eyes there had been almost a knowing, an\r\nunderstanding look. But the man could have no business with him—of that\r\nhe was certain.\r\n\r\nThe fellow was just a bully, probably, a big, hulking lump of beef who\r\nresented, as it might chance, Annister’s undeniably cosmopolitan air;\r\nthe sardonic flicker in the gray-green eyes; the cool, contemptuous\r\nappraisal. But, after all, it had been the giant who had begun it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, somehow, Annister was thinking that he had seen him before, and,\r\noddly, illogically enough, he found himself liking the man—why, he could\r\nnot have told.\r\n\r\nBlack Steve Annister, “with the heart of a cougar and the conscience of a\r\nwolf,” as a disgruntled enemy had at one time phrased it, could have sat\r\ninto that game had he been so minded, with profit to himself, pecuniary\r\nand otherwise, but he had preferred to play the hand that had been dealt\r\nhim. Later, at Dry Bone, that would be another matter.\r\n\r\nNow, his lean, strong, hawklike face darkened abruptly with the thought\r\nbehind his eyes, and then—for Annister had eyes in the back of his\r\nhead—he was suddenly aware that the conductor was advancing along the\r\naisle.\r\n\r\nThe three men opposite had ceased their conversation as if at an order.\r\nTwo or three of the remaining passengers stared curiously, after the\r\nmanner of their kind (they were small tradesmen, merchants, going on\r\nbeyond the border to Tucson), as the conductor halted at Annister’s elbow.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Mister—Mister—” he began.\r\n\r\n“—Annister!” The answer was low, even, controlled, but beneath the silken\r\ntone there ran a hint of iron.\r\n\r\n“Mister Annister,” repeated the conductor. “Will you—just a moment,\r\nplease?”\r\n\r\nAnnister rose, following the official outward toward the vestibule. And\r\nas he went he could feel those eyes, avid, curious, boring into his back.\r\nHe permitted himself the ghost of a cold grin as the conductor, turning\r\nin the entry, laid a respectful hand upon his sleeve.\r\n\r\n“I’m—sorry, sir,” he said, low. “You getting off at Dry Bone, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\nThe words were less a question than a statement of fact. Annister nodded.\r\nThe conductor, a tall, bronzed man who might have been an old-time line\r\nrider, shot a quick glance over his shoulder. Then he said, his tone\r\neven, matter-of-fact:\r\n\r\n“I—_wouldn’t_—if I was you.”\r\n\r\nAnnister stared. Then, producing his cigar-case, lighting a long, black\r\ninvincible, the twin to which the conductor had selected, he remarked\r\ncasually:\r\n\r\n“They’re good cigars.... In the trenches we smoked ‘Woodbines’—a cross\r\nbetween tar-heel and alfalfa; you have a lot of alfalfa out here, eh? And\r\nthe ‘third light,’ as we used to call it, most always got his—three men\r\nlighting up from the same match, you know.”\r\n\r\nHis tone abruptly hardened; the glance that he turned upon the conductor\r\nnow was like a lance of flame.\r\n\r\n“Well—I’m not superstitious—but—will you tell me _why_?”\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the conductor was breaking a rigid Company rule by\r\njoining Annister in a surreptitious cigar. Now he turned guiltily as a\r\nvoice sounded from the corridor at his back:\r\n\r\n“Ex-cuse me—but could I trouble you for a light?”\r\n\r\nThe third man, as Annister could see, was tall and heavily built, with\r\nbroad shoulders and a curiously small head. He had a sharp, acquisitive\r\nnose, and a mouth tight-lipped and thin. Annister, versed in reading men,\r\nwas abruptly conscious of an instinctive and overmastering repugnance.\r\nFor the man’s eyes were cold and cruel, sleepy-lidded, like a snake’s,\r\nroving between Annister and the conductor in a furtive scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe match was still alight. Annister, his hand steady as a rock, extended\r\nit to the newcomer, who, with an inarticulate grunt, lighted his\r\ncigarette, turning, without further speech, backward along the corridor.\r\n\r\nAnnister waited a moment until he was certain that the man was out of\r\nearshot. Then:\r\n\r\n“The ‘third light,’ eh?” he murmured, his tone abruptly hardened.\r\n“Well—and why shouldn’t I get off?” he asked, grimly.\r\n\r\nThe conductor for a moment seemed at a loss.\r\n\r\n“It’s like this, Mr. Annister,” he said slowly. “I’m a new man on the S.\r\nP., but I’ve been hearing a lot—no gossip, you understand—but a conductor\r\nhears a good deal, by and large.... And this is a cow country, or it used\r\nto be—pretty wild, in spots. Dry Bone, now—they run things pretty much to\r\nsuit themselves—”\r\n\r\nHe paused, in a visible embarrassment.\r\n\r\n“There’s a party of four back there in the diner—I couldn’t help\r\noverhearing what they were saying, and—well—I’m just repeating what they\r\nsaid, and no offense—”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” interrupted Annister, evenly. “Go on.”\r\n\r\n“Why—they said,” continued the conductor, “that you were an Eastern\r\ngambler—a—confidence-man—that you were not wanted here in Dry Bone; that\r\nit wouldn’t be exactly healthy for you if you stopped off—that’s all. I\r\nthought you’d be wanting to know. And if you’ll take my advice, even if\r\nyou haven’t asked it, I’d say: go on to Tombstone—you can figure it out\r\nfrom there.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” answered Annister shortly. “I’m getting off—at Dry Bone. How\r\nsoon are we due?”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen minutes,” replied the conductor, glancing at his watch. “But\r\nif I was you, sir, I’d stay aboard; it’s a bad crowd there, as I happen\r\nto know, and they’ve got a branch of the S. S. S. there, only they work\r\nit to suit themselves: tar-and-feathers is just a picnic with that gang;\r\nthey’re a stemwinding bunch of assassins, I’ll say! So far they’ve\r\noperated under cover, mostly, and down here in the Southwest—well—it\r\nain’t a lot different, in some ways, than it was thirty years ago. You’ll\r\nsee—because they’re—”\r\n\r\n“—Southwest of the Law—is that it?” Annister laughed shortly. “Well—much\r\nobliged, old-timer,” he said. “I won’t forget it. But I’m getting off.”\r\n\r\nThe long train was slowing for the station stop. Annister, striding to\r\nhis seat, got down his heavy bag. For a moment he stood, considering, his\r\ngaze, under lowered lids, upon the long coach and its passengers in a\r\nswift, squinting appraisal.\r\n\r\nThe three men were gone.\r\n\r\nSomehow, they had found out who he was. Well—that made little difference,\r\nhe reflected, grimly, except to force matters to a show-down, and the\r\nsooner the better.\r\n\r\nFor there was a man in Dry Bone; Annister had known him in the old time;\r\nand it was with this man, unless he was greatly mistaken, that his\r\nbusiness had to do.\r\n\r\nHe would put it to the touch, then; he would sit into the game, and would\r\ncome heeled, and they could rib up the deck on him, and welcome.\r\n\r\nHe was turning to the door when, of a sudden, there came to him a second\r\nwarning: there was a swish of skirts, a sudden odor of violets. Annister\r\nhad a glimpse of a blonde head beneath a close-fitting toque, as the girl\r\npassed him, disappearing in the doorway.\r\n\r\nAnd there, on the flooring at his feet, was a square of white.\r\n\r\nAnnister, stooping, retrieved it, holding the card upward to the light:\r\n\r\n    “_Stay on board. Dry Bone is not safe—for you. Be warned—in\r\n    time._”\r\n\r\nThere was no signature. Annister made a little clucking sound with his\r\ntongue, his face set like flint. He was alone in the car.\r\n\r\nThe train had stopped now as, bag in hand, he shouldered through the\r\ndoorway. And then, abruptly, as if materialized out of the air, a face\r\ngrinned into his, lips drawn backward from the teeth in a soundless\r\nsnarl. It was the big man with the cauliflower ear.\r\n\r\n“Hombre,” he said, without preamble, in a hoarse, carrying whisper, “take\r\nan old-timer’s advice: go back—_an’_ set down—you savvy? This place—it\r\nain’t exactly healthy for a young fellow like you, I’m tellin’ yu! For if\r\nyou don’t—”\r\n\r\nAnnister’s cold stare was followed by his voice, low, incisive:\r\n\r\n“You’re blocking the doorway,” he said, with a sort of freezing quiet.\r\n\r\nThe giant’s hard mouth twisted in a sneer; his great paw reaching upward\r\nwith a clawing motion, blunt fingers upon Annister’s shoulder. Then—what\r\nfollowed happened with the speed of light.\r\n\r\n“You can’t get off here, Mister—” the giant was continuing, when the\r\nwords were blotted out. Annister’s right fist, behind it the full weight\r\nof his two hundred pounds of iron-hard muscle, curved in a short arc;\r\nthere was a spanking thud. The big man, lifted from his feet, crashed\r\ninto the front door-frame, slumping face downward in an aimless huddle of\r\nsprawling limbs.\r\n\r\n“The hell you say!” grinned Black Steve Annister, leaping lightly to the\r\nplatform, with never a backward glance.\r\n\r\nSuch was the manner of his coming.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER TWO_\r\n\r\nTHE HAND IN THE DARK\r\n\r\nThe one hotel in Dry Bone was the Mansion House.\r\n\r\nAnnister, crossing the lobby, was aware of a veiled hostility in the\r\nstares directed at him from the group of loungers in the doorway; they\r\ngave ground grudgingly, as he came in, with a sort of covert truculence.\r\n\r\nHere, as he could see, there was a curious mingling of the Old West and\r\nthe New: men, whose attire would have created no remark, say, even in New\r\nYork; others, booted and spurred, cartridge-belted and pistolled—but all,\r\nas he noticed, with, for headgear, the inevitable Stetson.\r\n\r\nOnce in his room, and the door locked and bolted, he busied himself for\r\na moment with a sheaf of papers, several of them adorned with a huge,\r\nofficial seal; they crackled as he put them in an inner pocket. Then,\r\ndressed as he was, he lay down upon the bed, but not to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was late—hard upon midnight—when the sound for which he had waited\r\ncame with the soft _whirring_ of the window-weights. The sound was not\r\nloud; it would not have awakened him had he been asleep; but Annister\r\ncould hear it plainly enough.\r\n\r\nHe had removed his shoes upon retiring. Now, in his stocking-feet, he\r\napproached the window, a black, glimmering oblong against the windy\r\nnight without. As he watched, the faint _whirring_ ceased; a pair of\r\nhands appeared suddenly out of the darkness, fingers hooked into the\r\nwindow-sill.\r\n\r\nAnnister drew a faint, hissing breath. In the star-shine, for there was\r\nno moon, the fingers showed in a luminous grayness against the sill,\r\nclawlike, malformed, like the talons of a beast, which in effect they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nAnnister knew them upon the instant, for, in far-off Java, for instance,\r\nhe had seen those hands, or, rather, the same and yet not the same. And\r\nin that instant he had acted.\r\n\r\nBoth hands upon the window-sash, he brought it down with a crash upon\r\nthose fingers; there followed a yelp of pain, inhuman, doglike—a groaning\r\ncurse—the slam of a falling ladder—a heavy thud—silence.\r\n\r\nAnnister smiled grimly in the darkness. Whoever it was, the intruder\r\nwould never be certain as to whether that window had crashed downward\r\nof its own accord, or not. And leaning in the window, Annister raised\r\nit cautiously again after a moment. He heard presently the slow drag of\r\nretreating footsteps; after all, it had not been much of a drop.\r\n\r\nClosing and bolting the window, he undressed in the darkness, and with\r\nthe facility of an old campaigner was asleep and snoring beneath the\r\nblankets between two ticks of the watch.\r\n\r\nBut in the morning a surprise awaited him.\r\n\r\nAlways an early riser, he was breakfasting alone in the empty dining-room\r\nwhen the waitress brought him a note. Beyond noting that she was pretty,\r\nand that she did not look like a waitress, Annister, somewhat engrossed\r\nin the business in hand, for a moment stared at the envelope with\r\nunseeing eyes.\r\n\r\nThen, ripping it open, he took in its contents in one swift, flashing\r\nglance:\r\n\r\n    _“My dear Mr. Annister_:\r\n\r\n    _“I would be very glad to see you at my office at ten this\r\n    morning—if you are able to be there.”_\r\n\r\nIt was signed simply: “Hamilton Rook.”\r\n\r\nAnnister grinned fleetingly in answer.\r\n\r\n“Well—it’s not another warning, at any rate,” he said, half aloud,\r\nturning to the consideration of his breakfast bacon. Then, at a low voice\r\nat his back, he turned:\r\n\r\n“Did you—say your coffee needed warming, sir?”\r\n\r\nIt was the waitress.\r\n\r\nAnnister had turned the note, face downward, on the table, with a quick\r\nflirt of his thumb. How long she had been there behind him he could not\r\ntell, for he had heard no sound.\r\n\r\n“Thanks—no,” he said shortly, his hard eyes boring into hers with an\r\nalmost insolent appraisal.\r\n\r\nYes—she was pretty, and more than that, her violet eyes darkening now\r\nunder his abrupt, almost savage scrutiny. And her voice—it was like a\r\nbell just trembling out of silence. Annister spoke:\r\n\r\n“Have you been here long—in Dry Bone, I mean?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe waitress smiled, and it was not the smile of a waitress, Annister\r\nwas convinced. Now, with a girl like that for a partner—was his unspoken\r\nthought—he could—well....\r\n\r\n“N-no, sir,” the girl made answer, with a sudden affectation of primness.\r\n“I came in yesterday, sir—on the same train with you, sir. I—I’ve just\r\nbeen—engaged.”\r\n\r\nAnnister repressed an absurd prompting to ask her how many times she had\r\nbeen engaged before, and to whom and at what. Her eyes were assuredly\r\nhypnotic, with lashes long and delicately fine.\r\n\r\n“_Umm_,” he rumbled in answer.\r\n\r\nWas it possible, after all, that she had been the girl in the crimson\r\ntoque? And, with the card in his pocket, for a moment he was tempted to\r\nshow it to her. Instead:\r\n\r\n“Well—I hope you like it here,” he said. “You’ll know me—the next time?”\r\n\r\nAnd for a moment he could have sworn that in the face of the girl there\r\nhad come all at once a curious, almost a baffling look, at once enigmatic\r\nand self-revealing. But the entrance of the vanguard of breakfasters\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nHe watched her for a little as with a swaying, lilting step she moved off\r\nto minister to the late-comers, his eyes speculative. Then, turning once\r\nmore to the letter, he re-read it as a man reading a cipher:\r\n\r\n“_If you are able to be there._” Could there be a double meaning in that?\r\nFor if Rook had sent that midnight visitor, then there were no lengths\r\nindeed to which he might go—for the hand, like a beast’s paw, upon the\r\nwindow-sill, had been, as Annister had known upon the instant, the hand\r\nof the Thug, the Dacoit, the Strangler.\r\n\r\nWarnings, thrice repeated; a hand in the dark; a waitress who was not\r\nall she seemed; an invitation, suave, and, as Annister conceived it,\r\nironic—it was a situation not without its possibilities for action.\r\n\r\nAnd Black Steve Annister loved action. Perhaps, after all, he was to have\r\nit now, whether he would or no.\r\n\r\nRook he had known aforetime, but he was convinced that the latter would\r\nnot recognize him save as Black Steve Annister, wastrel of the wide\r\nworld, gentleman adventurer-in-waiting to the High Gods of Adventure and\r\nDerring-do, knight-errant of the highways and byways of Criminopolis,\r\nscarce a black sheep, indeed, but a wolf of the long trail and of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nRook had known him as such in the days when, as jackal for certain vested\r\ninterests, the black-bearded lawyer had run foul of young Annister, just\r\nthen beginning a hectic career of spending which, but three years in the\r\npast, had abruptly terminated with Annister’s complete disappearance from\r\njoyous jazz-palace and discreetly gilded temple of high hazard.\r\n\r\nFor he had dropped out of sight, lost, as a stone is lost, in the\r\nsea-green waters of oblivion, save for an occasional ripple thereafter\r\nwhich proclaimed him blacksander, beachcomber, _chevalier d’industrie_,\r\nuntil one memorable evening a twelve-month gone ... but Rook would be\r\nknowing nothing of that.\r\n\r\nAnnister had come home from the South Seas to find his father gone, and a\r\nnote: “_Do not look for me, for you are not my son._” And an exhaustive\r\ninquiry had failed even to suggest the slightest clue.\r\n\r\nThe elder Annister could have written his check for seven figures, and it\r\nappeared, following his disappearance, that he had done so; they had come\r\nin from North and South and East and West, steadily, and, as it seemed,\r\nwith purpose. But as a clue to his whereabouts they had been unavailing.\r\n\r\nBut, from the moment of his discovery of that note, Black Steve Annister,\r\nvisiting a certain office in a certain side-street not far distant from\r\nthe Capitol, had surprised its guardian with a terse:\r\n\r\n“That offer of yours, Childers—I’ve come to take it up.”\r\n\r\nThe man called Childers had bent a keen look upon his visitor; another\r\nmight have described it as unpleasant, stern.\r\n\r\n“Well, you know just what that means, eh?” he had said. “You’ll be merely\r\na cog, a link—remember that!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Annister had answered, and there the interview had ended.\r\n\r\nAnd so Black Steve Annister, serving two masters, had come to Dry Bone,\r\nand the end, as it might chance, of the long trail leading Westward into\r\nthe setting sun.\r\n\r\nHe rose from the table now, going out into the pale Spring sunshine on\r\nhis way to the office of Hamilton Rook. He found the building presently;\r\nit was the court-house; there was a figure of Blind Justice with her\r\nscales just over the entrance. Annister reflected sardonically that,\r\nhere, in Carter County, distant from a civilization at present as remote\r\nas the moon, she was probably also deaf—and dumb. And presently, at the\r\nhead of a dark flight, there was the office, with the legend:\r\n\r\n                              HAMILTON ROOK\r\n\r\n                               ATTORNEY AND\r\n                            COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW\r\n\r\nThere was a small sign at the corner of the door; in obedience to its\r\ninvitation to “Walk In,” Annister, his hand upon the knob in a noiseless\r\npressure, abruptly flung it wide.\r\n\r\nA split second before the opening of that door, and while his hand was on\r\nthe knob, Annister had seen, or thought that he had seen, a swift shadow\r\npass suddenly across the ground-glass panel; there was the grating sound\r\nof a chair being moved backward.\r\n\r\nThen, standing in the doorway, Annister’s eyes narrowed; he stood rigid,\r\ntense.\r\n\r\nFor the man facing him across the stained and battered desk, lean head\r\nlike a vulture’s set upon wide shoulders; mouth like a straight gash with\r\nits thin, bloodless lips; cold eyes fixed upon him in a silent, ophidian\r\nbrightness—was—the “third light,” as he had called him—the man whom he\r\nhad met for a moment back there in the smoker of the Transcontinental.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER THREE_\r\n\r\nBEHIND THE ARRAS\r\n\r\n“Mister Annister,” greeted the man at the desk. “You didn’t know me, eh?\r\nWell—it’s a long time—three years—and my beard—” he passed a bony hand\r\nacross his chin—“I sacrificed that long ago; it is scarcely the fashion.\r\nNow—” he waved a hand, indicating a chair at his left—“sit down, won’t\r\nyou? We can—talk better so.”\r\n\r\nAnnister seated himself, his eyes upon the cold eyes just across. That\r\nthe man who sat there had inspired those warnings he had little doubt;\r\nthat he had sent that midnight assassin against him, he was convinced.\r\nAnd yet—he was at a loss to find the reason.\r\n\r\nRook was not aware, could not be aware, of a certain fact known only to\r\nhimself, Annister, and a certain man just then twenty-five hundred miles\r\ndistant in that dim office hard by the Capitol; it was beyond the bounds\r\nof possibility. No—it could scarcely be that, he told himself.\r\n\r\nAnd of a sudden a cold rage shook him so that he trembled; his hands,\r\nflat upon the desk-top, balled suddenly into fists. This man—this suave,\r\nsecret knave with the eyes of ice, and the implacable, grim mouth—sat\r\nthere now, removed from him merely by the width of the narrow desk. And\r\nif it were true, that which he suspected, then this man, this jackal,\r\nthis Prince of Plunder with the heart of a hyena and the conscience of a\r\nwolf—why, he had earned his quittance a hundred times over.\r\n\r\nThe flat black shape of the automatic hung in a sling under his left\r\narm-pit—Annister had forgotten that. He knew merely that he was face\r\nto face with the man whom he had come twenty-five hundred long miles\r\nto meet; he saw him now as through a crimson mist. And for the moment\r\nthe careful plan that he had made—that, too, was forgotten, lost in the\r\nalmost overmastering impulse to drive his fist into that face so close to\r\nhis, the cold eyes, the pallid, sneering mouth....\r\n\r\nSomething of this must have showed in his face, plainly visible to the\r\nman who faced him across the desk.\r\n\r\nThere was a semi-twilight in the room even by day. Now the lean head\r\nthrust forward like a striking snake; there came a sudden, brief\r\nexplosion of movement, a darkening flash, as the hand, holding the heavy\r\nautomatic, swung upward level with his visitor, point-blank.\r\n\r\nAt such a distance it would be impossible to miss.\r\n\r\nThere was a curtain just behind him; Annister had noticed it upon\r\nentering. Now at his back it rippled suddenly along its length as if at\r\nthe passage of a heavy body just behind. The lawyer smiled thinly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my friend,” he said, “it is so easy to be indiscreet! And one must\r\nmeet force with force. This—it is theatrical, if you like—but—it is just\r\na little demonstration of my—preparedness. I thought—you see....”\r\n\r\nThere came a sardonic flicker in the nearset eyes; the voice purred now\r\nin the semi-darkness like a cat’s:\r\n\r\n“I must protect myself.... There are—reasons.... You see, I thought, for\r\na moment, that you—ah—meditated a resort to—violence. And violence is\r\nsomething that I deplore, my friend; and here I am surrounded by violent\r\nmen, ‘sudden and quick in quarrel,’ as the poet has it; sometimes they\r\nare difficult to control.”\r\n\r\nAnnister had himself in hand. The veiled threat with which the lawyer\r\nhad ended bothered him not at all. Now, casually as it seemed, but\r\nwith the lightning riposte of a duellist, his hand reached out; there\r\ncame a sudden wrench, a twist, a snarling oath from Rook; and Annister,\r\npocketing the pistol, smiled grimly now in answer.\r\n\r\n“Now—‘we can talk better so’!” he mocked. “The balance of power, ha? Now,\r\nlet me tell you something: You left the big town—for your health; that\r\nwas three years ago, wasn’t it? I didn’t recognize you, but it was a\r\npretty close shave, at that!”\r\n\r\nHe laughed, but there was a ring of menace in it. His hard eyes held the\r\npale ones of the lawyer with a chill malevolence.\r\n\r\n“Rook,” he said, low, “you’re as crooked as a ram’s-horn; you’re a bent\r\ntwig; I wouldn’t trust you this side of hell further than I could see\r\nyou, and not even then. Now—” his voice cracked suddenly in the thick\r\nsilence like the cracking of a whip—“you had the infernal gall to send\r\nme—here—_after_ you’d have accounted for me—_by the left hand_, ha?\r\n\r\n“I left that window open, because, if you want to know, I was expecting\r\nsomething of the sort. And now—”\r\n\r\nThe hand holding the pistol became rigid as a rock.\r\n\r\n“—I want the reason _why_—in a holy minute, Mister Hamilton Rook—or else—”\r\n\r\nFor a heart-beat the face of the lawyer seemed swollen to a poisonous\r\nwhiteness; the veins in his neck and temples stood out in ridges.\r\nThen—the long, spatulate fingers spread wide with a curious, flicking\r\nmotion, thumbs downward; the curtain bellied outward suddenly as if in\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nAbruptly Annister felt for a heart-beat a something that was like a cold\r\nwind blowing upon the back of his neck, and it was a wind of death.\r\nSomething slid past his shoulder with the speed of light; talons of\r\nsteel, thumbs downward, pressing at the base of his brain. He heard a\r\nhoarse, whistling croak—a sound that was nothing human. Then—\r\n\r\nThere is but one answer to that strangler’s grip, and it is a secret\r\nknown only to a few. Annister had learned it, no matter where, and in the\r\nlearning he had paid....\r\n\r\nNow, an infinitesimal split second before the beast paws had encircled\r\nhis throat, his forefinger and thumb had flashed upward, hooked, as steel\r\ngaff is hooked, between those fingers and his throat.\r\n\r\nThere followed a straining heave; a cry, inhuman, beastlike, like the\r\nmewing of a cat. Annister, rising to his feet, leaned abruptly to the\r\nleft—straightened, with one quick, explosive heave of his powerful\r\nshoulder-muscles—and the body of his antagonist catapulted over his head.\r\n\r\nFlung clear of the desk, he landed, heavily, on one shoulder-point,\r\ntwitched a moment, lay still. It was the “flying-mare,” and none but a\r\nmaster could have summoned it.\r\n\r\nAnnister turned the unconscious man over with his foot.\r\n\r\n“_Jivero!_” he muttered, between set teeth.\r\n\r\nHe shivered slightly in the humid air of the warm room. For the man was\r\nan Ecuadorian savage—a jungle-beast; once, in Quito, Annister had seen\r\ntwo or three: flat-faced, rather handsome savages; how or where Rook had\r\nacquired the fellow only the lawyer could have said.\r\n\r\nAccording to his savage code, he had been faithful—as a tiger is faithful\r\nto his trainer, his keeper. Annister, brave as he was, would have\r\npreferred a rattler, a fer-de-lance, for company. He turned now with an\r\nabrupt movement to Rook, who, slumped in his chair, sat staring at the\r\nhuddled figure of the Indian where he had fallen.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Annister, “I’ve a notion, Mister Hamilton Rook, to shoot\r\nfirst, and ask questions afterward.... However, I confess I’m still a\r\ntrifle curious as to your motive—more so, since this second pleasant\r\nlittle interlude with your man Friday here. Now—may I ask you—_why_?”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer’s lips were moving, fumbling together, without sound. Fingers\r\ntrembling, like a man in a fit, at length he lifted dull eyes to his\r\ninterrogator:\r\n\r\n“This,” he enunciated thickly, gesturing toward the huddled figure on\r\nthe carpet. “It was to save my—life—that is the truth, Annister—you\r\nmust—believe. The reason—for the others.... I did not know it was you\r\nthere in the smoker; I thought—that is—” he appeared to breathe of a\r\nsudden like a man who had been running—“we had a report—that you were\r\nquite another man—one who was—ah—would be antagonistic, in fact, to\r\ncertain operations—and so—”\r\n\r\nHe spread his hands wide with a little, flicking gesture.\r\n\r\n“—That is why—but now, of course, you will understand—?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Annister, bluntly. “I understand. You thought I was—an\r\noperative, ha? Well—I’m not—that kind of an operative. But—” his manner\r\nbecame all at once sharp, incisive; the gaze that he bent upon Rook was\r\nthe shrewd look of a man who sees his opportunity ready to his hand.\r\nCunning was in that look, and an infinite guile; the lawyer did not miss\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHere was something that he could deal with. He had known of Annister’s\r\nreputation as of old; it had been none of the best, certainly, and with\r\nthat knowledge now there came a measure of reassurance. And if he was any\r\njudge of men, here was one whom he could use: the acquisitive gleaming in\r\nthe eyes; the hard, incisive mouth, the predatory, forward-thrusting tilt\r\nof the head—if he, Rook, was any judge of men, here was a man whom he\r\ncould use.\r\n\r\nOld Travis Annister had disinherited him: the son who had been a waster\r\nin the far places of the earth—that was an added reason. And at the\r\nthought there came a pale gleaming in the lawyer’s close-set eyes, like\r\nthe sun on water. Travis Annister ... and Travis Annister had disappeared\r\n... well, of course, he had heard of it. His voice reached the younger\r\nman in a purring whisper:\r\n\r\n“As I have hinted, Mr. Annister, I am interested in—certain operations;\r\nshall we call them—speculative? For some time now I have been in need of\r\na sort of silent partner, or, rather, the Doctor—”\r\n\r\nHe caught himself with a _click_ of his strong, white, even teeth.\r\nAnnister’s face continued impassive, save for the keen eyes, veiled now\r\nunder lowered lids. Rook continued:\r\n\r\n“Annister,” he said suddenly, as if he had abruptly come to a decision,\r\n“I’ll lay my cards on the table with you: I need a man, and he can not\r\nafford to be too—scrupulous, do you understand? The—the doctor tells me\r\nI have been overdoing it.” He gave a faint, wintry smile. “We are—out of\r\nthe beaten track here—southwest of the law, as you might call it....”\r\n\r\nHe lowered his voice to a faint, hissing sibilance:\r\n\r\n“I will expect you to ask no questions. You have been a cow-man; there\r\nare certain interests to the north and the north-east of us; I am naming\r\nno names, understand? There is a good deal of range left, as you know,\r\nand—now, listen to me....”\r\n\r\nHis voice went on. For perhaps five minutes Annister listened in a heavy\r\nsilence. And all that time, although the lawyer had not once called a\r\nspade a spade, the thing that he had unfolded was clear enough:\r\n\r\nIt was the old story; with something of a novel twist. First, there were\r\nthe outfits scattered north and north-east, as Rook had said. The running\r\noff of a few cows, for instance, re-branding, and the rest of it—it was\r\nan old story to Annister—but there was something more. Annister, as he\r\nlistened, realized that the thing was big, worthy, indeed, of the keen,\r\ndevising brain that had evolved it.\r\n\r\nA good many of the ranches had, for some time past, been owned and\r\noperated by the packers themselves; three of these: the Bar T, the Cross\r\nCircle L, the Flying U, were northward from Dry Bone scarce a hundred\r\nmiles. But there were still other outfits. And, as Annister listened, he\r\nwas hearing again a name, or, rather, a symbol, the name and the symbol\r\nof masked and hooded violence, and it was “S. S. S.”\r\n\r\nRook, it appeared, was the moving spirit of it, in Dry Bone, at any rate,\r\nbut as the tale unfolded Annister, putting two and two together, supplied\r\nfor that cryptic symbol a name, nation-wide and respected: the name of a\r\ngreat Company, an Octopus indeed, which, with Hamilton Rook as its agent,\r\nplanned nothing less than the ruthless despoiling of those independent\r\ncattle men who, out of a desert of sand and sage, had won a living\r\nfor their stock and for themselves, the rear guard of the order, now,\r\nas it seemed, indeed, caught in the far-flung tentacles of a monster,\r\nunscrupulous and without soul.\r\n\r\nAnnister’s part in it was to be simple. He was to do nothing as yet until\r\nthe lawyer should give the word. But a man was wanted: a gun-fighter; a\r\nman bred to violence who would not consider too closely the method or the\r\nmeans. For, as Rook had said, his eyes upon Annister in a sudden, biting\r\nscrutiny:\r\n\r\n“If, as a first step, say, the owners of these outfits\r\nshould—ah—disappear....”\r\n\r\nThere was to be no outright violence, it appeared; murder—that was an\r\nugly word; but it was of course possible that there might be—resistance.\r\nBut—there would be a fortune in it.\r\n\r\nAnnister’s part would be comparatively simple. He would merely carry out\r\nhis orders. Rook, eying him now in a close-lipped silence, watched as a\r\nspider watches from his ambush. Annister would be needing money; if the\r\nlawyer knew his man, and he thought that he did, here was something that\r\nwould be a lever, and a powerful one.\r\n\r\nAnnister lifted his head, then he brought his hand, palm downward, to the\r\ndesk-top. It was a movement, slow, even, controlled.\r\n\r\n“I’m with you,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Good!” exclaimed the lawyer. “Now—I want you to go over to the club;\r\nthere are a few men there I’d like you to meet. _Ha!_”\r\n\r\nAt his exclamation Annister, turning, followed his rigid, pointing\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\nThe huddled figure on the carpet had disappeared. There had been no\r\nsound, no sign. The Indian had vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER FOUR_\r\n\r\nTHE FACE IN THE MOONLIGHT\r\n\r\nAnnister had thrown in with Rook, but he trusted him no further than he\r\nwould have trusted a cougar, a mountain cat.\r\n\r\nAt the club, as the afternoon wore on to evening, he had met four or five\r\nmen: Beaton, the county judge, a red-faced tippler with, on the surface,\r\na heartiness that was repellant; Lunn, the hotel proprietor, a vast,\r\nasthmatic man with a small, porcine eye; Daventry, the Land Commissioner,\r\nwhose British accent, Annister noticed, would on occasion flatten to a\r\nhigh, nasal whining that was reminiscent of Sag Harbor or Buzzards Bay.\r\n\r\nThe rest, hard-faced, typical of their environment, Annister put down\r\nfor the usual lesser fry; hangers-on, jackals, as it might chance,\r\n“house-men,” in the parlance of the “poker-room”—Annister knew the type\r\nwell enough.\r\n\r\nThey seemed hospitable, but once or twice Annister had thought to detect\r\nin their glances a grimly curious look: of appraisal, and of something\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThere had been a game going, but he had not sat in, nor had the lawyer\r\ninvited him. The visit had been meant, plainly enough, as a sort of\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\n“We’re all here,” Rook had said.\r\n\r\nBut it was apparent, too, that there were one or two others who were\r\nabsent; Annister heard several references to “Bull”; but for the most\r\npart there was a silence, beneath which Annister could feel the tension;\r\nit was like a fine wire, vibrating, deep-down; almost, he might have\r\nsaid, a certain grimly quiet anticipation of that which was to come.\r\n\r\nPresently the telephone tinkled, loud in the sudden stillness; Annister\r\ncould hear the voice at the other end: harsh, strident, with a bestial\r\ngrowl that penetrated outward into the close room.\r\n\r\n“He can’t come,” came from the man at the telephone. “Bull—yeah—an’ I\r\nreckon he seems some disappointed.”\r\n\r\nAnnister noticed that the tension had all at once relaxed, and with\r\nit, as he could see, there was plainly visible in the faces about\r\nhim a certain disappointment. It was as if they had been waiting for\r\nsomething—something, well, that had not materialized. There was a laugh\r\nor two; a word stifled in utterance; one or two of the men, glancing at\r\nAnnister and away, gave an almost imperceptible head-shake. Even Rook, as\r\nAnnister could tell, appeared relieved as the newcomer rose, turning to\r\nthe company with a conventional good-night.\r\n\r\nFor just a split second it seemed to Annister that something _was_ about\r\nto happen; for a moment he saw, or fancied that he saw, a quick, silent\r\nsignal flash, then, from eye to eye; Lunn, the hotel man, had half risen\r\nin his chair; out of the tail of his eye, as he was turning toward the\r\ndoor, Annister was aware of a quick ripple, a movement, the shadow of\r\na sound, like the movement of a conjuror manipulating his cards, white\r\nhands flashing in a bewildering passade.\r\n\r\nBut nothing happened.\r\n\r\nLeaving, he had walked slowly toward the hotel, turning over in his mind\r\nthe story that had been told him by the lawyer. And there was one more\r\nquestion he wanted to ask him: a question that had to do with a square of\r\npaper that he had come upon among his father’s papers in New York, for\r\nit had been this chance discovery that had sent him, post-haste, to Dry\r\nBone, and the lawyer’s office.\r\n\r\nThinking these things, he was turning the corner to the hotel when, out\r\nof nowhere as it seemed, a man had passed him, walking with a peculiar,\r\ndragging shuffle. Seen under the moon for a moment, this man’s face\r\nhad impressed itself upon Annister: it was dark and foreign, with high\r\ncheek-bones, and—what seemed curiously out of place in Dry Bone—a black\r\nmoustache and professional Van Dyke.\r\n\r\nAnnister, watching the man, saw him turn into the doorway he had just\r\nquitted; it was the entrance to the “club”—two rooms above a saddler’s\r\nshop at the corner of the street.\r\n\r\nHalting a moment to look after the man, Annister was wondering idly who\r\nhe might be—certainly not the man called “Bull,” if there was anything\r\nin a name. And then, abruptly, he was remembering what the lawyer had\r\nlet fall about the “doctor”; perhaps that was who he was; he had had a\r\ndistinctly professional air.\r\n\r\nThe man’s eyes had lingered upon Annister for a moment, and for a moment\r\nthe latter had been conscious of a curious shock. For it had been as\r\nif the man had looked _through_ rather than at him; those eyes had\r\nglowed suddenly in the darkness, gray-green like a cat’s, in an abrupt,\r\nferocious, basilisk stare.\r\n\r\nAnnister, in his day, had seen some queer corners and some tight places;\r\nin Rangoon, for example, he had penetrated to a certain dark house in a\r\ndim backwater stinking and dark with the darkness of midnight even at\r\nhigh noon.\r\n\r\nAnd it was there, in that dark house, with shuttered windows like blind\r\neyes to the night, that he had seen that which it is not good for any\r\nwhite man to have seen: the rite of the Suttee; the blood-stone of Siva,\r\nthe Destroyer, reeking with the sacrifice—ay—and more.\r\n\r\nAnd something now, at that time half-perceived and dimly understood,\r\ncame again with the sight of the dark face with its high cheek-bones,\r\nand black, forking beard; for he had seen a creature with a face and yet\r\nwithout a face, mewling and mowing like a cat, now come from horrors, and\r\nthe practitioner had been—\r\n\r\nThe man who but just now passed him at the corner of the street, the man\r\nwith the dark, foreign visage, and the eyes of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER FIVE_\r\n\r\nPARTNERS OF THE NIGHT\r\n\r\nAnnister, pausing a moment at the corner of the street, was conscious of\r\na feeling of coldness, like a bleak wind of the spirit, as if death, in\r\npassing, had touched him, and gone on.\r\n\r\nFor the face of the man whom he had seen had been like the face of a\r\ndamned soul, unhuman, Satanic in its sheer, visible malevolence. So might\r\nSatan himself have looked, after the Fall.\r\n\r\nSomehow, although the man had looked straight ahead, seeming to see\r\nmerely with the glazed, indwelling stare of a sleepwalker, Annister had\r\nfelt those eyes upon him; he was certain that he had been seen—and known.\r\nBut now he had other things to think about.\r\n\r\nHe had intended going to the hotel. Now, on an impulse he bent his steps\r\naway from it, turning to the building in which were the offices of Rook.\r\n\r\nBut he did not enter by the main doorway. There was an alley further\r\nalong; into this he melted with the stealth and caution of an Indian,\r\nfeeling his way forward in the thick darkness to where, as he had marked\r\nit earlier in the day, there was a rusty fire-escape; its rungs ran\r\nupward in the darkness; they creaked now under his hand as he went slowly\r\nup.\r\n\r\nRook’s office was on the second floor. Annister, reaching the window,\r\nfound it locked, but in a matter of seconds had it open, with the soft\r\n_snick_ of a steel blade between sash and bolt; the thing was done with a\r\nprofessional deftness, as if, say, the man who had opened that window had\r\ndone that same thing many times before.\r\n\r\nNow, crouched in the darkness by that dim square of window, the intruder\r\nstood silent, listening, holding his breath. A sound had come to him,\r\nfaint and thin, as if muffled by many thicknesses of walls; it penetrated\r\noutward from the private office, with the snick and slither of rasping\r\nsteel on steel.\r\n\r\nAnd at the instant that Annister, with a grim smile in the darkness,\r\nrecognized it for what it was, he knew, too, that someone had been\r\nbeforehand with him; someone interested, also, in Hamilton Rook; for the\r\nsound that he heard now, loud in the singing silence, was the sound of a\r\nsteel drill upon a safe.\r\n\r\nAnnister had seen that safe; it was scarcely more than a strong-box, a\r\nsheet steel, but thin; a “can-opener” could have ripped it from end to\r\nend, easily, in no time at all. Rook must feel secure indeed, he thought,\r\nto put his trust in so flimsy a repository unless, perhaps, he had other\r\nmeans. The Indian, for instance; the savage who, but a few hours ago, had\r\nmissed with his long talons for Annister’s throat by inches.\r\n\r\nBut somehow Annister did not think that the Jivero would be on guard.\r\nThere was no burglar-alarm protection; he had made certain of that;\r\nbut the man who was now busy with that safe must have come up by the\r\nstairway; doubtless he was on familiar ground. Perhaps he might be some\r\ndisgruntled confederate of the lawyer’s; well, he’d have a look-see, at\r\nany rate.\r\n\r\nAdvancing silently, on the balls of his feet, Annister traversed the\r\nlength of the outer office, peering around the doorway to where, under\r\nthe dim glow of a single drop-light, a figure, back toward Annister,\r\nknelt before the safe.\r\n\r\nThe drop-light, carefully shaded, would not be visible from without;\r\nunder its cone-shaped radiance Annister could see merely that the man\r\nwas wearing a cap, pulled low over his forehead; but something in the\r\nattitude of that kneeling figure: the turn of the head, the deft, darting\r\nmovement of the hand, was strangely familiar.\r\n\r\nAnnister grinned in the darkness at the same moment that he was aware\r\nof a curious contraction of the heart. This lone-hand cracksman worked\r\nevidently without confederates, unless, possibly, he might have a lookout\r\nposted on the sidewalk below. He spoke, barely above a whisper:\r\n\r\n“Hello!” he said. “Pretty careless, aren’t you? Now, do you think\r\nit’s—safe?”\r\n\r\nThe figure whirled; the hand, holding an automatic, came upward with the\r\nspeed of light; then dropped limply at her side as the girl surveyed him\r\nwith a stony look.\r\n\r\nIt was the waitress of the Mansion House.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, “you’ve caught me, but it looks to me as if I beat\r\nyou to it, Black Steve Annister.... Oh, I’ve heard of you, Mister Black\r\nSteve.... Well, now you’ve caught me, what are you going to do about it?”\r\n\r\nThe darkly beautiful face was scornful; the violet eyes, under the light,\r\nstormy with a something that Annister could not all define.\r\n\r\nAnnister bit his lip. To find her like this! And, all at once,\r\nrealization came to him with a sudden tightening of the heart.\r\n\r\nThis girl, waitress or not, crook or not—he had to confess that, in all\r\nhis wanderings up and down the earth, he had never met her like. A girl\r\nin a thousand, he had decided, back there in the dining-room of the\r\nMansion House. What a partner she would make! Now, with a girl like that\r\nfor a partner...!\r\n\r\nOn a sudden impulse he leaned forward, his eyes upon the safe door; it\r\nswung outward now; somehow she had opened it.\r\n\r\n“Pretty smooth,” he commented. “The combination, after all, ha? You\r\nworked it. Now, before _we_ have a look, I want to tell you something.\r\nI—I’m looking for a partner, Miss—ah—Miss—”\r\n\r\n“—Allerton,” she told him, in her eyes a sudden, leaping spark, the\r\nbrief, baffling, enigmatic look that he had seen back there in the hotel\r\ndining-room. But it was gone again even as she spoke:\r\n\r\n“All right—partner!” she said, low. “When do we start?”\r\n\r\n“Right now!” answered Annister, his gaze upon the girl frankly\r\nadmiring. He had expected the usual feminine evasions, a play for time,\r\nhesitation—anything but this ready acquiescence in his abrupt proposal.\r\n\r\nHe was not entirely sure of her; his admiration for her beauty, her\r\npoise, had nothing to do with the cold judgment whispering now that the\r\nwhole affair might, after all, be a blind, a trap, devious and crooked as\r\nthe devious and crooked turnings of Hamilton Rook.\r\n\r\nBut with Annister to decide was to act.\r\n\r\nBending, he swung wide the safe door, groping forward with exploring\r\nhand. His back was toward the girl; consequently he did not see the\r\nsudden, revealing gleam in the violet eyes, the quick hardening of the\r\nmouth. Swinging forward his pocket flash, the light danced, glimmering,\r\nupon a packet of papers, a sheaf of documents. Annister, running over\r\nthem swiftly, gave a quick exclamation, his hand, in a lightning\r\nmovement, palming something which he secreted in an inner pocket.\r\n\r\nHe turned sidewise to the girl.\r\n\r\n“Lord!” he exclaimed disgustedly. “Nothing but papers! Partner, we’re out\r\nof luck!”\r\n\r\nEvidently the girl had been oblivious. Now, however, her quick, flashing\r\nfingers sorted the contents of that safe as with a practiced hand, to\r\nleave them, as had Annister, inviolate, save for that oblong of paper\r\nreposing now in the pocket of his coat.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of the entrance it was black dark as they parted. The girl\r\ndid not live in the hotel, she told him; that had been a part of her\r\nplan. They would meet again, of course. But once in his room, and with\r\nthe shades drawn and the door locked and bolted, Annister, taking the\r\npaper from his pocket, smoothed it out under the light.\r\n\r\nHe looked; then looked again, breath indrawn sharply through clenched\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nFor that paper was a canceled check; it had been drawn to “Cash”; and the\r\nsignature, in a hand that he knew upon the instant, was the signature of\r\nhis father, Travis Annister.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER SIX_\r\n\r\nTHE LIVING GHOST\r\n\r\nAnnister had heard nothing from Rook other than that he had been again\r\ninvited to a further session of the “Club” for that evening.\r\n\r\nAlone in his room on the morning following his adventure in Rook’s\r\noffice, his eye had been caught and held by a news item printed on an\r\ninside page of the _Durango County Gazette_: he had nearly passed it\r\nover; but now the lines leaped out at him as if they had been blazoned\r\nacross the paper in a double-column spread:\r\n\r\n    Travis Annister Still Strangely Missing—Retired Capitalist Gone\r\n    Since January—Foul Play Feared\r\n\r\nAnd, separated from it by the width of a single column, he read:\r\n\r\n    Retired Banker Disappears—Newbold Humiston a Suicide?—Friends\r\n    Fear for Safety\r\n\r\nBut it was at a third item, tucked away in an obscure corner that\r\nAnnister stifled a quick word in his throat. Newbold Humiston had been a\r\nfriend of his father’s; it was an odd coincidence, to say the least of\r\nit. And the story went on to say that three other men, all nationally\r\nknown, had, so to speak, between suns, disappeared as completely as if\r\nthe earth had opened and swallowed them.\r\n\r\nAnd that third news item, irrelevant as it might have been, told of an\r\nincident, odd and unusual enough; it had happened in Palos Verde, distant\r\nfrom Dry Bone a long twenty miles of hazardous mountain trail:\r\n\r\nA man had come in, in rags and tatters; at first they had thought him\r\na desert rat, a prospector, light-headed from starvation, for his\r\nincoherent babble had proclaimed him no less a personage than Rodman\r\nAxworthy, prominent banker of Mojave. The sheriff of Palos Verde, on the\r\noff chance, had wired Mojave, and the word had come back that Axworthy\r\nhad been missing; they were sending a man.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of this man, however, the mystery deepened, for it\r\nappeared that the derelict was indeed Axworthy, and yet not Axworthy at\r\nall, for whereas the true Axworthy had had a high, aquiline nose and a\r\nwide, generous mouth, the derelict was snub-nosed, swarthy, where the\r\nbanker had been fair; he was, simply, another man.\r\n\r\nBut there had been this about it: on the banker’s left forearm,\r\nunderneath, there had been a curious birth-mark; the derelict had\r\nspoken of it, but upon examination the arm showed smooth and bare. The\r\ninvestigator from Mojave had been obviously skeptical until, abruptly,\r\nthe ragged claimant had taken from his pocket a curious, removable\r\nbridge; a dentist in Mojave who had made it, he said, could identify it.\r\nIt fitted perfectly.\r\n\r\nThis looked like proof, but the thing was obviously impossible. And then,\r\nas “Axworthy” was being taken back to Mojave, he went suddenly stark,\r\nstaring crazy, repeating over and over, with reference to the bridge:\r\n\r\n“It’s the one thing they didn’t get—the one thing....”\r\n\r\nAnd there the matter rested, save that, upon arrival in Mojave, the\r\nbridge was found to be missing. The emissary from Mojave seemed to\r\nremember a dark-faced stranger who had been seated opposite them in the\r\ntrain, but that was all; the man had jostled against his charge upon\r\nalighting; the last proof, if indeed it might be called a proof, was gone.\r\n\r\nAnnister frowned thoughtfully, his mind upon that canceled check in\r\nhis pocket. And he was remembering one other thing, and that was the\r\nsquare of paper which he had found among his father’s effects, for on\r\nit had been a name, or, rather, two: the name of Hamilton Rook, and\r\nof another, unknown to Annister. And as to that Axworthy case, it was\r\ncommon knowledge that lunatics, for instance, entertained frequently the\r\ndelusion that they were people of importance. There was nothing new in\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nSomehow, it seemed to him that he held in his hands the pieces of a\r\njig-saw puzzle that, even if put together, made but a patchwork of\r\nmotives and design, which yet, if he could but find the key, would be as\r\nclear as crystal.\r\n\r\nThat paper found in his father’s office; the interview with Childers, at\r\nWashington; the long trip westward; the warning message on the train;\r\nthe big man with the ice-blue eye and the square jaw of a fighter; the\r\nattack in the hotel; the meeting with Rook, and the meeting with the\r\ngirl; the finding of that canceled check—and, last, the matter of those\r\nqueerly related news items just under his hand—these made a pattern to be\r\nunraveled only by the warp and woof of Fate.\r\n\r\nAnd the chance meeting with the bearded stranger at the corner of the\r\nstreet: consider how he would, Annister’s mind kept turning backward to\r\nthat meeting and those eyes that were like the eyes of a damned soul,\r\nmalignant, cold, in their abysmal, cold cruelty of discarnate Evil.\r\n\r\nDiscarnate! That was it; that would express it; for the man, as he\r\nrecalled him, seemed somehow less than human; there had been about him\r\nan aura, an emanation, that was like a tide rising from the depths, from\r\ndarkness unto darkness....\r\n\r\nAnnister was scarcely superstitious, but he was again conscious of that\r\nicy chill; he shivered, as a man is said to shiver when, according to an\r\nancient superstition, someone is said to be walking over his grave.\r\n\r\nHe rose, walking to the window, to peer outward into the sunwashed\r\nstreet. The coil was tightening; he felt it; and he was but one man\r\nagainst many. And knowing what he knew, or suspecting what he suspected,\r\nit seemed to him all at once that the sunlight had flattened to a\r\nheatless flaming of pale radiance; there seemed a menace in it, even as\r\nthere seemed a menace in the very air, a waiting, a tension, like a fine\r\nwire drawn and singing at a pitch too low for sound.\r\n\r\nAbruptly he heard a sound; it was like the scratching of a rat in the\r\nwainscot, faint and thin. His door was locked.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at it, the knob turned, slowly, stealthily. He could see it\r\nturning.\r\n\r\nThen, faint but unmistakable, came a knock.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER SEVEN_\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE DOOR\r\n\r\nThe knocking was not loud; it was merely a discreet tap; but there was a\r\nquality of hurry in it.\r\n\r\nAnnister, moving without sound on the thick pile of the rug, almost with\r\nthe same motion turned the key and flung wide the door.\r\n\r\nAt first he could see nothing. The corridor, thick-piled with shadows\r\neven at high noon, showed merely as a darkling glimmer out of which there\r\nsprang suddenly a face, like a white, glimmering oval; a voice came, with\r\na quick, hissing sibilance:\r\n\r\n“_Ssh!_ Quiet! I must not be seen! Or else he.... Close the door!”\r\n\r\nThe girl stepped inward swiftly, her white face turned to the man before\r\nher in a sort of frozen calm. Annister had a vague impression of having\r\nseen her somewhere before: that golden head beneath its close-fitting\r\ntoque; the faint, remembered odor of fresh violets; the face, with a\r\npiquant loveliness just now, however, white and drawn; it was like a\r\nstrain of music, heard and then forgotten.\r\n\r\nClosing the heavy door and locking it, he turned swiftly to the girl.\r\n\r\n“Well—?” he said, his gaze upon her in a cold, searching scrutiny. “Isn’t\r\nthis a trifle—_sudden_?”\r\n\r\nBut the girl lifted a stony face.\r\n\r\n“I have little time,” she said, with a curious, spent breathlessness,\r\nas if she had been running. “I am Cleo Ridgley, secretary to Hamilton\r\nRook—that is, I _was_; I am his secretary no longer, but he does not know\r\nabout it—yet.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, again with that hard-held breathing, moistening her stiff\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n“I warned you that day on the train; do you remember? I warned you\r\nbecause I knew Hamilton Rook.... I know him even better now. He meant to\r\nkill you, Mr. Annister, and now he schemes—”\r\n\r\n“—To use me—is that it?” interrupted Annister dryly; then, at her slow\r\nhead-shake, he stiffened.\r\n\r\n“He would have finished you even after your—agreement—but that is not\r\nhis way. But he will not make use of you in the way that you think.\r\nThat careful plan of which he told you—that was just a blind; there are\r\nno ranches near enough. The S. S. S.—that, too, was just a part of the\r\nstory. You see, he wants to keep you here, that is all, until such time\r\nas he thinks it necessary to—remove you. But his real motive, his actual\r\nplan I know nothing about. I may suspect, but I do not _think_ about it.”\r\n\r\nShe paused again, her expression rigid, as there sounded a faint,\r\nhalf-audible footfall from the corridor without. It passed.\r\n\r\n“He would—kill me—if he knew,” she continued tonelessly. “That warning on\r\nthe train—I did that at his order. If he could have frightened you off,\r\nhe would have been satisfied with that, but now, it will be—different,\r\nI tell you this on my own account. And now—”she laid a slim hand on his\r\narm—“don’t go to that rendezvous tonight, Mr. Annister. Ellison will be\r\nthere; you remember him? He was the man who tried to keep you on that\r\ntrain.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly with her lips, but her eyes were sombre.\r\n\r\n“Ellison is Rook’s jackal, just as Rook is—”\r\n\r\nThe sentence was never completed. There came a coughing grunt from just\r\noutside the door, a streak of flame from the half-open transom just\r\nabove; the girl stiffened, her face went blank; she slid downward to the\r\nrug, even as Annister, snapping back the lock, had flung wide the door.\r\n\r\nGun out, he burst into the corridor, as, from the shadows at a far\r\ncorner, he fancied that he heard the faint echo of a taunting laugh.\r\n\r\nBut there was no one there.\r\n\r\nRushing to the stair-head, he found nothing, nobody. The man who had\r\nfired that shot had used a silencer; he had disappeared, either into one\r\nof the bed-chambers to right and left, or down the stair. But it was no\r\ntime for speculation. The girl would be needing attention, if, indeed,\r\nshe was not already past all aid.\r\n\r\nAnnister had wasted no time. But, for a heart-beat, as he raced backward\r\nalong the hall, his eye was caught and held by the quick glint of metal\r\nfrom the carpet at his feet. Stooping as he ran, he swept up the object,\r\npossibly an empty shell; then, on the threshold of his room, recoiled\r\nwith a gasping oath.\r\n\r\nFor the girl had vanished!\r\n\r\nStunned, Annister stood silent, mechanically unclosing his stiff fingers\r\nupon the object which they held. He stared at it now, rigid with\r\nremembrance, and a growing fear.\r\n\r\nOddly twisted and distorted, its dull gold surface glinting dully under\r\nthe light, the thing that he had found lay on his open palm.\r\n\r\n_It was a dentist’s bridge._\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER EIGHT_\r\n\r\nODDS—AND THE MAN\r\n\r\nAnnister had been absent from that room not longer than ten racing\r\nseconds. It was unthinkable that the girl had vanished of her own\r\nvolition, even had it been physically possible.\r\n\r\nGlancing around the room, he saw that the windows were closed and bolted;\r\nthe flooring was solid, substantial; there could be no ingress save by\r\nthe door through which he had just come.\r\n\r\nThere was another door; it led to the next room; but Annister, with a\r\nhabit of inbred caution, had tried it, and found it locked. Now, in two\r\nswift strides, he had covered the space between, had tried that door,\r\nsetting his weight against it as he turned the knob.\r\n\r\nUnder his weight it gave outward with a sudden slatting clatter. They,\r\nwhoever they might be, had unlocked it; it had been through this\r\nadjoining room that they had taken the girl.\r\n\r\nAnnister, glancing swiftly around this room, saw that it was obviously\r\nunoccupied; the bed had been made up; there was no sort of clue that he\r\ncould see. The invisible assassin had had a key; that was it, of course.\r\n\r\nBut as to the rest of it, Annister could only speculate. It was an\r\nimpasse, and a mystery.\r\n\r\nGoing downward to the dining-room, as it was now past noon, he glanced\r\ntoward the desk, but if he had had any thought of reporting the attack\r\nupon the girl, or her disappearance, he thought better of it; he would\r\nkeep his own counsel; a decision helped by a sight of Lunn, the hotel\r\nproprietor, who, lounging at the desk, raised his sleepy-lidded, vulture\r\ngaze at Annister as the latter was turning toward the dining-room.\r\n\r\nAnnister, in that brief glance, thought to detect in those eyes,\r\nmilky-pale, a veiled, sardonic flicker. If, behind this latest happening,\r\nthere was the fine, Italian hand of Hamilton Rook, Lunn was in cahoots\r\nwith the lawyer, of that there could be little doubt. For, as Annister\r\nwas convinced, there had been a menace in those eyes half turned to his,\r\nan insolence, a bright, burning truculence, that, as he turned into the\r\nlong dining-hall, brought the swift blood to his cheek in a dark tide.\r\n\r\nBut at his table another surprise awaited him. Mary Allerton was gone.\r\nThe heavy-handed Swede who served him told him that she had left,\r\nsuddenly, that morning; a message had come for her, it appeared, but the\r\nsubstitute could tell him nothing further. Annister let it go at that.\r\n\r\nRising from the table, he went outward to the long bar, a cool, pleasant\r\noasis, indeed, in the fierce heat of the drowsy afternoon. He greeted the\r\nbartender, a tall man with the wide shoulders of a cowman, with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe man had been friendly; in fact, he had been the sole friend that\r\nAnnister appeared to have made since his arrival in Dry Bone. Now the\r\nbartender leaned forward, speaking in a whisper behind his hand:\r\n\r\n“Watch your step, Mr. Annister,” he said.\r\n\r\nAnnister gave an almost imperceptible nod. Then, his drink before him\r\nupon the stained and battered mahogany, he glanced sidewise along the\r\nrail, to where, at the far end, two men stood together, eying him under\r\nlowered brows.\r\n\r\nTo Annister it seemed that there had fallen a sudden quiet. Just prior to\r\nhis entrance he had heard talk and laughter, the _clink_ of glasses, a\r\nthick, turgid oath. Now there appeared to rise and grow a tension, as of\r\nsomething electric in the air; Annister felt it in the white face of the\r\nknight of the apron, the sudden silence, the rigid figures of the two men\r\nat the end of the long bar.\r\n\r\nBehind him, and a little to his left, three men were seated at a table:\r\nBristow, sheriff of Dry Bone, a big man with a bleak, pale eye, and a\r\nmouth like a straight gash above a heavy chin barbered to the blood. With\r\nhim were two others whom he did not know.\r\n\r\nLunn was nowhere in sight.\r\n\r\nThe taller of the two men standing at the bar turned, and Annister\r\nrecognized him as Tucson Charlie Westervelt, a gunman with a dangerous\r\nrecord. Westervelt was wearing a high-crowned, white Stetson; Annister\r\nmarked it at the distance, beneath it the fierce, hawklike face, turned\r\nnow in his direction, the thin lips set stiffly in a sullen pout.\r\n\r\nThe old West had passed with the passing of the _remuda_, the trail herd,\r\nthe mining camps; the wide, free range of the long-horned cattle was no\r\nmore; but Dry Bone had not changed save that the loading-pens had gone;\r\na cow would be a curiosity. But the lawless spirit of the ancient West\r\nremained. “Southwest of the Law,” indeed, Dry Bone was a law unto itself,\r\nand now about him Annister felt the menace; it appeared that he had\r\nwalked into a trap.\r\n\r\nThe judge, the sheriff—what mockery of law there was—Annister knew that\r\nit would be against him, either way, attacking or attacked. He was\r\ncertain of it as Westervelt, moving slowly along the bar, halted when\r\nperhaps three paces distant, elbow raised, right hand extended, clawlike,\r\nin a stiff, thrusting gesture above his guns.\r\n\r\nIt was the gesture of the killer, the preliminary for the lightning\r\ndown-thrust of the stiff fingers; Annister knew that well enough. Now the\r\ngunman’s gaze, sleepy-lidded like a falcon’s, bored into his; his voice\r\ncame with a snarling violence:\r\n\r\n“_Mister_ Black Steve Annister,” he said, without preamble. “I understand\r\nyou’re some wizard with a canister, ha? A bad hombre! Musta been a\r\nlittle bird done told me, an’ that bird was sure loco, I’ll tell a man!\r\nBut _me_—” his tone hardened to a steely rasp—“I’m not thinkin’ you’re\r\nsuch-a-much!”\r\n\r\nIt was a trap; Annister knew that now, just as behind the gunman he could\r\nalmost see the dark face of Rook, with its sneering grin; the lawyer had\r\ninspired it.\r\n\r\nHis automatic hung in a sling under his left arm-pit, but even if he\r\ncould beat Westervelt to the draw, he knew well enough what the result\r\nwould be: a shot in the back, say, from the men sitting just behind,\r\nor—arrest, and the mockery of a trial to follow it. Either way, he was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHis own eyes held the gunman’s now, glancing neither to the right nor to\r\nthe left. He was conscious of a movement from the three men at the table;\r\nWestervelt’s companion, a short, bowlegged man, with the pale eyes of an\r\nAlbino, had stepped backward from the bar; Annister felt rather than saw\r\nhis hand move even as his own hand came up and outward with lightning\r\nspeed; flame streaked from his pistol with the motion.\r\n\r\nOnce in a generation, perhaps, a man arises from the ruck who, by an\r\nuncanny dexterity of hand and eye, confounds and dazzles the common run\r\nof men. As a conjurer throws his glass balls in air, swifter than eye can\r\nfollow, so Annister, crouching sidewise from the bar, threw his bullets\r\nat Westervelt.\r\n\r\nThe gunman, bending forward at the hips, crashed to the sawdust in a\r\nslumping fall, as the Albino, firing from the hip, whirled sidewise as\r\nAnnister’s second bullet drilled him through the middle. For the tenth\r\nof a second, like the sudden stoppage of a cinematograph, the tableau\r\nendured; then Annister, whirling, had covered Bristow where he sat; the\r\ntwo men with him, white-faced, hands pressed flat upon the table-top,\r\nstared, silent, as Annister spoke:\r\n\r\n“You saw, Bristow,” he said, low and even, his eyes upon the cold eyes of\r\nthe sheriff in a bright, steady, inquiring stare. “Now—what about it?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment a little silence held; then Bristow, moistening his stiff\r\nlips, nodded, his gaze upon Annister in a sudden, dazed, uncomprehending\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“All right, Mr. Annister,” he said heavily. “They came lookin’ f’r it, I\r\nreckon.... Well, you were _that_ quick!”\r\n\r\nAnnister smiled grimly, pocketing his pistol. Westervelt lay where he\r\nhad fallen, a dead man even as he had gone for his gun, lips still\r\ntwisted in a sullen pout. The bowlegged man, stiff fingers clutching his\r\nheavy pistol, lay, face downward, in the sawdust. The bartender, with an\r\nadmiring glance at Annister, leaned forward as Bristow and the two men\r\nwith him went slowly out.\r\n\r\n“They may try to get me for it, Mr. Annister,” he said, “but I’m no man’s\r\nman; well, not Rook’s, and you can lay to that! Bristow and his friends\r\nkept out of it, you noticed? Bristow’ll do nothing, _now_; not yet a\r\nwhile, at any rate, but—mebbe they sort of savvied me a-watchin’ t’ see\r\nthey didn’t run no whizzer on you!”\r\n\r\nHe lifted the heavy Colt, where it had lain hidden by the bar-rail,\r\nthrusting it in its scabbard with a grin.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I _aimed_ t’ see that they was sittin’ close, _an’_ quiet,\r\nMr. Annister,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, old timer,” said Annister. “I’ll not forget.”\r\n\r\nBut as he went outward into the waning afternoon he was thinking of that\r\nrendezvous of the night. For Rook would be there, and it had been Rook,\r\nhe was certain, who had engineered that ambush in the Mansion House bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER NINE_\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE IN THE “CLUB”\r\n\r\nThe time was nearly ripe. The clue of those newspaper items; the canceled\r\ncheck; the somewhat repellant evidence of the battered piece of goldwork\r\npicked up in the corridor of the Mansion House—Annister had been able to\r\nput two and two together, to find a sum as strange, as odd, say, as five,\r\nor seven, or even one.\r\n\r\nBut that name that had trembled on the lips of Rook’s secretary remained\r\na secret; with it, Annister was convinced, he would be able to pull those\r\nthreads together with a single jerk, to find them—one.\r\n\r\nHe had had news from Mojave: the dentist had identified the insane man as\r\nhis patient by means of his chart, but, with that face, the man could not\r\nbe Banker Axworthy—it simply could not be. And yet he was!\r\n\r\nIt was something of a riddle, and more, even, than that, for the thing\r\nsavored of the supernatural, of necromancy, of a black art that might,\r\nsay, have had for its practitioner a certain personage with the eyes of a\r\ndamned soul and a black, forking beard, curled, like Mephisto’s; Annister\r\nthought that it might.\r\n\r\nFurther, the conductor of that train had been able to describe, somewhat\r\nin detail, the man who had jostled the derelict and his companion; the\r\nman had been a stranger to the conductor; he had been tall and thin, with\r\na small, sandy moustache, and a high-arched, broken nose, and he had been\r\nwearing the conventional Stetson. The fellow might have been disguised,\r\nof course, but if Annister could find the black-bearded man, discover his\r\nidentity, he was reasonably certain that he would not draw blank.\r\n\r\nIt was no certainty, of course, but it was worth the risk, he told\r\nhimself. It would be a desperate hazard that he was about to face, he\r\nknew. Thinking of his father, together with the remembrance of that\r\nunholy and unspeakable horror that he had witnessed, born of the stinking\r\nshadows of that dark street in a city foul and old, its people furtive\r\nworshipers of strange gods, Annister felt again that crawling chill which\r\nhad assailed him with the passing of the tall man with the eyes of death.\r\n\r\nWith Annister, to decide was to act. Dispatching a brief telegram in code\r\nto a certain office in a certain building in Washington, he went now to\r\nkeep his rendezvous with Rook and the rest. It was yet early, scarce\r\neight in the evening, and the street was full of life and movement,\r\nbefore him, and behind.\r\n\r\nAnd before him and behind, as he went onward, he was conscious that those\r\nwho walked there walked with him, stride for stride; they kept their\r\ndistance, moving without speech, as he turned the corner of the dusty\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nIf he had had any doubt about it, the doubt became certainty as, wheeling\r\nsharply to the left, they kept him company now, still with that grim,\r\ndaunting silence: a bodyguard, indeed, but a bodyguard that held him\r\nprisoner as certainly as if the manacles were on his wrists.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet dark, but with a rising wind there had come a sky overcast\r\nand lowering; low down, upon the horizon’s rim to the eastward, the\r\nviolet blaze of the lightning came and went, with, after a little, the\r\nheavy salvos of the thunder, like the marching of an armed host.\r\n\r\nBut Annister, his gaze set straight ahead, turned inward at the entrance\r\nof the saddler’s shop, mounting the stairs, as, behind him he heard the\r\nheavy door slam shut.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it had been the wind, but as Annister went upward he heard, just\r\nbeyond that door, the murmur of voices; they reached him in a sing-song\r\nmutter against the rising of the wind, in a quick, growling chorus.\r\n\r\nThere had been something in that snarling speech to daunt a man less\r\nbrave than the man on that narrow stair, but Annister went upward,\r\nlightly now, to meet whatever waited behind the door set with its\r\nnarrow panel that he could see merely as a dark smudge of shadow in the\r\nencircling gloom.\r\n\r\nHe rapped, twice, and the door fell open silently, disclosing the long\r\nroom in which, as he remembered, he had sat, but a few nights in the\r\npast, to listen as the lawyer and his crowd had waited for the man called\r\n“Bull.”\r\n\r\nThe room was brightly lighted. At a long table, midway between door and\r\nwindows, five men were seated: Lunn, his fat face gray with a sort of\r\neager pallor, was chewing nervously at an unlighted cigar; he glanced up\r\nnow at Annister’s entrance, turning to a big man on his right. At the\r\nhead of the table, his veiled glance like the stare of a falcon, sat\r\nRook, but it was upon the big man next to Lunn that Annister’s glance\r\nrested with an abrupt interest as the lawyer spoke:\r\n\r\n“Welcome to our city, Mr. Annister!” he said, in a voice that reminded\r\nAnnister of molasses dripping from a barrel. “I want you to meet—Mr. Bull\r\nEllison; he’s been right anxious to meet you, haven’t you, Bull?”\r\n\r\nAnnister, in the passage of an eye-flash, understood. This was the man\r\nwhom he had encountered in the vestibule of the smoker, and, of a sudden,\r\nmemory rose up out of the past, and, with it, a picture: a padded ring\r\nunder twin, blazing arcs; the thud and shuffle of sliding feet; a man,\r\nhuge, brutish, broad, fists like stone mauls, yet, for all his bulk, a\r\nvery cat for quickness.\r\n\r\n“Bruiser” Ellison, they had called him then; a heavyweight whose very\r\nbrute strength had kept him from the championship; that, and a certain\r\neasy good nature which was not apparent now in the bleak staring of the\r\neyes turned now upon Annister, remorseless, under lowered brows.\r\n\r\nNow, as if at a signal, the men about the table rose; the table was\r\nhauled backward to the wall, leaving a wide, sanded space under the\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nAnd then, even as Rook spoke, Annister abruptly understood: this gang of\r\nthieves, as he knew now—“Plunder, Limited,” as Cleo Ridgley had called\r\nthem—Annister knew them now, under the leadership of Rook, for an outfit\r\nwhich would stop short of nothing to attain its ends. His eyes, roving\r\nthe long room up and down, searched now for that dark face, with its\r\nblack, forking beard, but he was not really expecting to see it, but\r\nthat, if Rook was the actual leader, Black Beard was “the man higher up,”\r\nAnnister was, somehow, convinced.\r\n\r\nThey had failed with Westervelt and his _segundo_; now, as the man called\r\n“Bull” came forward across the floor, Rook spoke:\r\n\r\n“Ellison hasn’t forgotten his meeting with you, Annister; he says you\r\nplayed him a dirty trick; hit him when he wasn’t looking; that right,\r\nBull?” he asked, with a certain sly malice directed at the giant with the\r\ncauliflower ear.\r\n\r\n“And now,” Rook’s purring tones continued, “he wants satisfaction; he’ll\r\nget it, won’t he, Mister Annister?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment, as Annister’s eyes bored into his, the lawyer’s face\r\nshowed, like an animal’s, in a Rembrandtesque shading of high light and\r\nshadow beneath the lights. Stripped of its mask, it was like the face\r\nof a devil; now the mouth grinned, but without mirth, the lips drawn\r\nbackward from the teeth in a soundless snarl. He laughed suddenly, and\r\nthere was nothing human in it, as Annister, his back to the wall, smiled\r\ngrimly now in answer.\r\n\r\nHe had been somewhat less than discreet, he reflected; Rook’s purpose\r\nhad shown in his eyes; he, Annister, had walked into a trap from which,\r\nthis time, there could be no escape. He had meant to beard them to their\r\nfaces, wring from Rook an admission as to his father, perhaps more; then\r\nshoot his way out, if need be.\r\n\r\nBut now—he would have to fight this giant, a ring veteran of a hundred\r\nbattles, with bare fists, surrounded by an encircling, hostile cordon,\r\nwho, if by any chance he might prove the victor, would see to it that he\r\npaid for that victory with his life.\r\n\r\nAnnister knew that it was on the cards that Rook, for instance, would\r\nshoot him down as remorselessly as a man would squeeze a mosquito, say,\r\nout of life between thumb and finger. But it was the lawyer’s humor,\r\ndoubtless, to see him manhandled, perhaps killed beneath the drumming\r\nimpact of those iron fists.\r\n\r\nCalmly, he removed his coat, bestowing his automatic in the pocket of his\r\ntrousers. He did it openly, turning to face Ellison, who, stripped to\r\nan athletic undershirt and trousers, regarded Annister with a grinning\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\nHe was big; perhaps twenty pounds heavier than Annister, with wide\r\nshoulders and a deep arching chest; with his forward-thrusting jaw and\r\nbullet head, with its stiff fell of pig’s-bristles, the long arms like\r\na gorilla’s, he towered over his antagonist like a cave bear, a grizzly\r\nwaiting for the kill, and like a cave bear, at Rook’s snarling call of\r\n“Time!” he was upon the lesser man like a thunderbolt, fists going like\r\nflails.\r\n\r\nAnnister, in his day and generation, had absorbed the science of hit,\r\nstop, and getaway under masters of the art who pronounced him, as an\r\namateur, the equal of many a professional performer of the squared\r\ncircle; he was lean and hard, whereas Ellison’s waistline showed, under\r\nthe thin shirt, in folds of fat.\r\n\r\nIf the onlookers expected to see Annister annihilated by that first,\r\nfurious rush, they were mistaken. Crouching, lightly, on the balls of\r\nhis feet, he drove forward a lightning straight left, full on the point.\r\nEllison, coming in, took it, grunting; the blow had traveled a scant six\r\ninches, but there had been power in it.\r\n\r\nIt set him back upon his heels, from which, as he rose, raging, he dove\r\nin with a ripping one-two punch, which, partly blocked by his antagonist,\r\nyet crashing through the latter’s guard, landed high upon his cheek-bone\r\nwith a spanking thud.\r\n\r\nIt had been a grazing blow; otherwise, the fight might have ended then\r\nand there. Annister, backing nimbly before the giant’s rush, realized\r\nthat he must avoid a clinch; at in-fighting the giant would have the\r\nedge: those mast-like arms and massive shoulders, the huge bulk—they\r\nwould, at close quarters, with the drumming impact of the great fists,\r\nhave spelled a quick ending with the sheer, slugging power of the attack.\r\n\r\nHe heard Rook snarl as, side-stepping like a sliding ghost, he countered\r\nwith a long, curving left.\r\n\r\nSo far, he had been holding his own. If he could keep the giant at his\r\ndistance, he might wear him out. For this was not a fight by rounds; a\r\nprofessional pugilist, fighting in the pink, would have had bellows to\r\nmend at the end, say, of five minutes of a give-and-take encounter moving\r\nat high speed.\r\n\r\nCircling, feinting, ducking, Annister kept that long left in his\r\nadversary’s face, forcing the pace, yet keeping out of harm’s way save\r\nfor an overhand swing, which, landing high up upon his cheek-bone, turned\r\nhim half round with the impact, throwing him off balance to a slumping\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nUp like a flash, however, he ducked, dodged, evading those mighty arms\r\nthat strove desperately to reach him through that impenetrable guard.\r\n\r\nA fight with four-ounce gloves can be a bloody affair enough, but with\r\nnature’s weapons, under London Prize Ring rules, it can be a shambles.\r\nArmed with the cestus or the mailed fist, Ellison might have wreaked\r\nhavoc as a gladiator of old Rome punished his adversary to the death. As\r\nit was, Annister, his face a bloody mask, where that socking punch had\r\nlanded, gave Rook and his supporters heart of grace.\r\n\r\n“Take him, Bull!”\r\n\r\nThe screaming advice was in the high voice of Lunn; the others echoed it.\r\nBut if Annister was in desperate case, the giant, sobbing now with the\r\nfury of his spent strength, was weaving on his feet.\r\n\r\nLegs like iron columns upbore that mighty strength, but a pile-driving\r\nright, behind it the full weight of Annister’s two hundred pounds of\r\niron-hard muscle, sinking with an audible “_plop!_” in his adversary’s\r\nmidriff, brought from the giant a quick, gasping grunt.\r\n\r\nEllison’s endurance was almost done. He could “take it,” but, hog-fat\r\nfrom a protracted period of easy living, professional fighter as he had\r\nbeen, this amateur, with the arching chest of a greyhound and the stamina\r\nof a lucivee of the long trail, was wearing him down.\r\n\r\nTrading punch for punch now, Annister abruptly cut loose with\r\npile-driving right and lefts; they volleyed in from every angle; there\r\nwas a cold grin on his lips now as he went round the giant like a cooper\r\nround a barrel, bombarding him with a bewildering crossfire of hooks and\r\nswings, jabs and uppercuts.\r\n\r\nAnnister, at the beginning of the fight, had expected the usual tricks of\r\nthe professional: holding in the clinches; butting; the elbow; the heel\r\nof the hand against the face; but Ellison had fought fair.\r\n\r\nNow, as the giant, boring in against that relentless attack, faltered,\r\nmouth open, labored breath sucked inward through clenched teeth, Annister\r\nstepped backward, hands dropping at his sides.\r\n\r\nEllison, almost out, stood, weaving on his feet, fronting his adversary,\r\na queer look of surprise in his face, and a something more. Annister,\r\nstrangely enough, as has been mentioned, had, in spite of his encounter\r\nwith Ellison in the smoker, conceived something for the man that had\r\nbeen close to liking. Somehow, rough as the man was; crooked, by all the\r\nsigns; the tool of Rook and of his minions, he had the blue eye of a\r\nfighter—the straight, level look of a man who, though an enemy, would yet\r\nfight fair.\r\n\r\nAnnister, breathing heavily, thrust out his hand.\r\n\r\n“A draw, ha?” he said. “Well—suppose we let it go at that.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Ellison appeared to hesitate; there came again the queer\r\nlook in his eyes, as of surprise, wonder, and a something more. There\r\ncame a grating curse from Lunn; a sudden movement from the onlookers\r\nroundabout.\r\n\r\nEllison’s great paw closed on the extended hand with a grip of iron, as\r\nRook’s voice rose, strident, under the lights:\r\n\r\n“Bull—are you crazy? This man—he’s just—a dam’ _dick_!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER TEN_\r\n\r\n“IN THE NAME OF THE LAW!”\r\n\r\nIt was out. Rook, his hand in a lightning stab for Annister’s coat,\r\nturned over the lapel, holding it forward for all to see.\r\n\r\nOn it was a small gold badge—the symbol of the Secret Service. The secret\r\nwas a secret no longer.\r\n\r\nHow long Rook had known of it Annister could not be certain, but now, at\r\nthe growling chorus of swift hate, he whirled. His pistol came up and\r\nout, as there came a startling interruption, or rather, two.\r\n\r\nHe heard Ellison’s voice, roaring in the narrow room:\r\n\r\n“Hell’s bells, young fellow, I’m with you, and you can lay to that! For\r\nthis once, anyway! You sure can handle yourself!”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Rook and the rest. “Now—you bums, get goin’! Dick or no\r\ndick, I’ll play this hand as she lays. Get goin’!”\r\n\r\nThe great hand, holding a heavy Colt, swung upward on a line with\r\nAnnister’s as the door burst inward with a crash; and, framed in the\r\nopening, there showed on a sudden the flaming thatch of the bartender,\r\nDel Kane.\r\n\r\nHis cowboy yell echoed throughout the room, eyes blazing upon the hotel\r\nman where he sat.\r\n\r\nIn two strides, he had joined Annister and Bull; guns on a line, the\r\nthree fronted the five who faced them, silent, tense. Kane’s voice came\r\nclear:\r\n\r\n“I followed you, Mr. Annister; thought they’d try t’ run a whizzer on\r\nyuh; I’m pullin’ m’ freight after today, anyway; Mister Lunn can have his\r\njob, an’ welcome! Now—I ben keepin’ cases on Mister Rook, he’s a curly\r\nwolf, ain’t you, Rook? A real bad hombre, an’ you can lay to that! But he\r\nain’t goin’ northwest of nothin’, he ain’t.... Now, you dam’ short-horns,\r\nshow some speed!”\r\n\r\nBut there was no fight in Rook, Lunn and Company. Glowering, their hands\r\nin plain sight, weaponless, they sat in a sullen silence, as Annister,\r\nbacking to the doorway, was followed by Ellison and Kane. Outside, under\r\npale stars, the giant spoke:\r\n\r\n“I don’t aim to be too all-fired honest, Mister Annister,” he said. “I\r\nthrowed in with Mister Rook, that’s so, but he’s played it both ends\r\nagainst the middle with me, I guess.... I reckon I’ll be movin’ out o’\r\nDry Bone in two—three hours.”\r\n\r\nHe grinned, wryly, out of the corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\n“You sure pack a hefty wallop, young fellow! I wish I could tell you\r\nsomethin’, but that man Rook, he’s as close-mouthed as an Indian, and\r\nthat’s whatever! His game—nobody knows what it is—Lunn, maybe—but they\r\nsure got a strangle-hold on th’ county; it won’t be healthy for me here\r\nafter tonight.”\r\n\r\nThe three men separated at the hotel, Annister entering the lobby with\r\na curious depression that abruptly deepened to a sudden, crawling fear\r\nas a call-boy brought him a note. The fear was not for himself, but for\r\nanother, for, although he had never seen the handwriting before, he knew\r\nit upon the instant.\r\n\r\nRipping open the envelope with fingers that trembled, he read, and at\r\nwhat he saw his face paled slowly to a mottled, unhealthy gray:\r\n\r\n    “_Partner_:\r\n\r\n    “_If you get this in time, please hurry. I’m in the toils, at\r\n    Dr. Elphinstone’s—it’s the stone house at the right of the road\r\n    leading north from Dry Bone—twenty miles, I think. I’ve bribed\r\n    a man to take this to you, and if he fails me, God help me!—God\r\n    help us all! If you fail me, you’ll never see me again—as Mary\r\n    Allerton, because the Devil’s in charge here, and they call him\r\n    the Jailer of Souls. I’ll be watching for you, at the south\r\n    window—you’ll know it by the red ribbon on the bars. And now—be\r\n    careful. If you get here at night beware of the guards—there\r\n    are three. And if it’s night there’ll be a rope hanging from\r\n    the window—you can feel for it in the dark. Now hurry._\r\n\r\n                                         “_MARY ALLERTON (No. 33)._”\r\n\r\n“_You’ll never see me again—as Mary Allerton._” Annister was aware again\r\nof that crawling fear. “_The red ribbon on the bars._” The place was in\r\neffect a prison, then.\r\n\r\nBut—“_No. 33_”! Annister’s heart leaped up. He knew the meaning of those\r\nnumerals well enough; he had been blind not to have suspected it. But\r\n“_Dr. Elphinstone_,” and “_The Jailer of Souls_!”\r\n\r\nWho could be the jailer of souls but the Devil? And Annister fancied that\r\nhe had seen the Devil at the corner of that street under the moon, with\r\nhis black, forking beard, and the cold eyes of death.\r\n\r\nThe trail was warm now, as he thought, but—if he were too late? He put\r\nthe thought from him, turning to the perusal of a telegram in code which\r\nhe had found waiting for him at the desk; translated, it read:\r\n\r\n    “With you Thursday with four, six, twenty-one, and the others.\r\n    Look for thirty-three.\r\n\r\n                                                         “CHILDERS.”\r\n\r\nBut there was no time to be lost. Thursday was tomorrow. He would have to\r\ntake his chance of their finding him, for there was nobody whom he could\r\ntrust. Ellison had gone, even if he might have chanced the giant in so\r\ndelicate a matter; Del Kane, likewise. He must take his chance. Striding\r\nto the door, he stiffened abruptly at a drumming rap, and a hoarse voice\r\nin the corridor without:\r\n\r\n“Open up in there; open up!”\r\n\r\nAnnister, a pulse in his temple beating to his hard-held breath, jerked\r\nback the door, to face—\r\n\r\nBristow, behind him three men whom he recognized as hangers-on at the\r\nhotel bar. They had something of the look of long-riders, villainous,\r\nhard-bitten; as one man, they grinned now, but without mirth, as the\r\nsheriff spoke:\r\n\r\n“Annister—I arrest you for the murder of Tucson Charlie Westervelt and\r\nBartley Pattison. In th’ name of th’ Law!”\r\n\r\nAnnister knew that if he resisted they would shoot him down; in fact, he\r\nknew, too, that was what they wanted; it would be the easiest way. Under\r\nthe menace of the guns, he spread his hands, palms downward, preceding\r\nthe four men down the stairs outward to the jail.\r\n\r\nBut as the heavy door clanged shut behind him, Annister, his gaze in a\r\nsightless staring into the north, groaned, in bitterness of spirit.\r\n\r\nMary was needing him: she was in peril, the greater because it was\r\nunknown—and—he would not be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER ELEVEN_\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF FEAR\r\n\r\nA house of silence, broken at times by a weird wailing as from the Pit; a\r\nhouse of dreams, gray in the moonlight, under the leprous-silvered finger\r\nof the moon, brooding now, a grim, gray fortress of the damned: the\r\nstronghold of the Beast.\r\n\r\nDense pines grew about it, so that when the wind wailed among them, like\r\nthe wailing of a lost soul, it met and mingled with an eerie ululation\r\nrising as if muffled by many thicknesses of walls, to end, after a\r\nlittle, with a quick shriek and a sudden hush, with, after a moment, the\r\nfaint echo of a taunting laugh.\r\n\r\nThat laugh would have struck terror to the swart soul of a lucivee, if\r\nlucivees have souls, for it was like an eldritch howling, faint and thin;\r\nlike the thin, tinkling laughter of a fiend, without pity and without\r\nruth.\r\n\r\nHere, in the sanitarium of Doctor Elphinstone, there were secrets within\r\nsecrets, walls within walls, downward, as in Dante’s Seventh Hell, and\r\nfrom this monastery of the hopeless there penetrated, on occasion,\r\noutward from its battlemented walls, wild, frantic laughter, but there\r\nwas nothing demoniac about it, because it was the laughter of the insane.\r\n\r\nBut that other laughter, like a sound heard in dreams—passers-by, if\r\nthere were any such, hearing it, would shudder, and pass on. For the\r\nsecret of that house of doom was a secret, terrible and grim; a secret,\r\nfor him who might have guessed at it, to be whispered behind locked doors\r\nand with bated breath. And there had been those who had whispered of\r\nthe lost souls within those walls, and the whisper ran that they were,\r\nindeed, madmen who had not been always mad, because—they had become such\r\n_after_ their commitment to the bleak house within the wood.\r\n\r\nThese were but whispers, merely, for the power upon that house was not\r\nalone the power of Evil, rising like a dark tide among the pines; for in\r\nDry Bone, and beyond it, in Palos Verde and Mojave, it was rumored that\r\nthe strong arm of the Law upheld it, or such law, say, as might have\r\nissued from the devious hand of Hamilton Rook.\r\n\r\nOnce—and it was never repeated—a man had come there from the capital; he\r\nhad demanded to see the doctor’s patients; that had been a long time in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nAnd as the investigator had stood there, viewing with a faint, creeping\r\nhorror the nondescripts paraded before him, gibbering, mouthing, in an\r\ninarticulate, furious babble, a man had burst suddenly from the line with\r\na strangled cry:\r\n\r\n“Jerry—don’t you know me? I’m Humiston—Newbold....”\r\n\r\nThe voice had been the voice of Humiston, but the face—it had been the\r\nface of another, totally unlike; there had been no possible resemblance.\r\nBut the man had been—_sane_. The investigator was persuaded of that;\r\nsuffering under a peculiar delusion, indeed, but sane.\r\n\r\nThe man had rushed forward then, baring his arm; and there, on that thin,\r\npitiful flesh that had once been healthy and hard, there ran a curious\r\ndesign in red; the investigator sucked in his breath as that tell-tale\r\nbirth-mark sprang, livid, under his gaze. For he had seen it before.\r\n\r\nThe doctor’s eyes had narrowed to slits; somehow, the man from the\r\ncapital had gained the impression that it was the first time that he had\r\nseen that mark. But the investigator could do nothing. Birth-marks can be\r\nduplicated. He had waited then, in a curious indecision as the bearded\r\ndoctor had interposed a suave:\r\n\r\n“Well, of course, Commissioner, you’re quite aware, or you should be, how\r\nit is: these paranoiacs are noted for their delusions—ah—megalocephalic\r\ntendencies, I should say.... They believe themselves to be—someone else,\r\nand always a bank president, say, a famous actor, an author, a great\r\ngeneral.... Now—Mr. Humiston—you knew him, I believe?” Beneath the silken\r\ntone there ran suddenly a hint of iron, of menace, veiled but actual; the\r\ninvestigator felt it. “This patient knew your name, of course,” the suave\r\nvoice had continued. “Poor fellow—we must be gentle with him.”\r\n\r\nAnd there the matter had ended. Curiously enough, the man who had claimed\r\nto be Banker Humiston had, after that first burst of frenzied speech,\r\nkept silent. Perhaps that mordant gleaming in the doctor’s eyes had\r\ntelegraphed a warning, a message, a command.\r\n\r\nBut the investigator went home, oddly shaken, to dream, like Pilate’s\r\nwife, of a white face with staring eyes which changed, even as he gazed,\r\ninto the face of his friend, Newbold Humiston; to hear, even in his\r\ndream, a voice, and it was the voice of the living, and of the dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a bare cell, six feet by six—a cubicle in which there was barely\r\nsufficient head room for a tall man to stand upright—a figure stood\r\nwith its hands clenched upon the bars, staring outward at the grim wood\r\nvisible to the south.\r\n\r\nTravis Annister had abode here in this living tomb three weeks now, three\r\ncenturies, in which, as in a nightmare of cold horror, he had been aware\r\nmerely of a face, three-pointed, bearded, the eyes active with a malign\r\nintelligence, the lips smiling always with the cold smile of death.\r\n\r\nTwice a day the small panel in his cell door had slid backward without\r\nsound, to frame, in the opening, the face of Dr. Elphinstone, like a face\r\nwithout a body, and without a soul.\r\n\r\nThe father of Black Steve Annister knew that it was not a dream that\r\nwould pass, because, on the second day, the head had spoken. Travis\r\nAnnister was scarcely a coward; he had fought like a baited grizzly when\r\nsurprised in his Summer camp by the men who had brought him, under cover\r\nof the night, to this prison-house beyond the pale.\r\n\r\nNow, at the voice, like the slow drip of an acid, Annister stared\r\nstraight before him, with the gaze of a man who has abandoned hope.\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Annister,” the voice had whispered, “the little matter of\r\nthat check, if you please.... You will make it out to ‘Cash’.... Ah, that\r\nis good; I perceive you are—wise.”\r\n\r\nIt had not been the pistol in the lean, clawlike hand; nor the eyes,\r\neven, brooding upon him with the impersonal, cold staring of a cobra;\r\nTravis Annister might have refused if it had not been for those sounds\r\nthat he had heard, the sights that he had seen when, taken at midnight\r\nfrom his cubicle, he had beheld the administration of the Cone.\r\n\r\nAnd, like Macbeth, with that one sight, and the sight of that which came\r\nafter, he had “supped full of horrors,” until now, at the bidding of that\r\ntoneless voice, he had obeyed. Three times thereafter, at the command of\r\nhis dark jailer, he had paid tribute, nor had he been, of all that lost\r\nbattalion, the single victim; there had been others....\r\n\r\nNow, separated from him scarce a dozen feet, a girl with golden hair\r\nsat, huddled, eyes in a sightless staring upon the stone floor of\r\nher cell. Cleo Ridgley had not been killed; she had been saved for a\r\nfate—beside which death would be a little thing—a fate unspeakable, even\r\nas had—Number Thirty-three.\r\n\r\nMary Allerton, removed from the others by a narrow corridor running\r\ncross-wise in the cell-block, watched and waited now for the signal of\r\nthe man to whom she had dispatched that message, it seemed, a century in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nThat morning they had found the rope; they had removed it without\r\ncomment, while the ophidian gaze of the dark Doctor had been bent upon\r\nher with what she fancied had been a queer, speculative look: a look of\r\nanticipation, and of something more. So far she had been treated decently\r\nenough; her cell was wide and airy, plainly but comfortably furnished;\r\nbut as to that look in the gray-green eyes of the Master of Black\r\nMagic—she was not so sure.\r\n\r\nThere came a sudden movement in the corridor without; a panting, a\r\nsnuffling, and the quick _pad-pad_ of marching feet. Mary, her eye to\r\nthe keyhole of that door, could see but dimly; she made out merely the\r\nsheeted figures, like grim, gliding ghosts; the figure, rigid, on the\r\nstretcher, moving, silent, on its rubber-tired wheels. Then, at an odor\r\nstealing inward through the key-hole, she recoiled.\r\n\r\nThat perfume had been sickish-sweet, overpowering, dense and yet sharp\r\nwith a faint, acrid sweetness; the odor of ether. And then, although she\r\ncould not see it, a man in the next cell had risen, white-faced, from his\r\ncot, to sink back limply as the dark hand, holding that inverted cone,\r\nhad swept downward to his face.\r\n\r\nA choked gurgle, a strangled, sharp cry, penetrating outward in a vague\r\nshadow of clamor—and then silence, with the faint whisper of the wind\r\namong the pines, the brool of the rushing river, the faint, half-audible\r\nfootfalls passing and repassing in that corridor of the dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTravis Annister sprang to his feet as the narrow door swung open to press\r\nbackward against the window-bars as the High-Priest of Horror, followed\r\nby his familiars, cowled and hooded, entered with a slow, silent step.\r\nThe Doctor spoke, and his voice was like a chill wind:\r\n\r\n“My friend, I bring you—forgetfulness.... A brief Lethe of hours.... And\r\nthen—ah, then, you will be a _new_ man, a man re-born, my friend....\r\nNow....”\r\n\r\nAnnister, his face gray with a sort of hideous strain, stared silent,\r\nwhite-lipped, as, at a low-voiced order, the attendants came forward.\r\n\r\nThe lean hand reached forward; it poised, darted, swooped; and in it was\r\nthe Cone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER TWELVE_\r\n\r\nCASTLE DANGEROUS\r\n\r\nAlone in his cell beneath the court-house, Black Steve Annister sat in\r\nsilence, gazing northward through the barred window to where, invisible\r\nin the thick darkness just across the street, the road ran, straight\r\nas an arrow from the bow, to that dark forest brooding in a changeless\r\nsilence where lay the House of Fear.\r\n\r\nChilders would have had his wire long since; but by the time that help\r\ncould come it would be—too late. Annister, fatalistic after a fashion,\r\nfelt this to be the fact even as he hoped against hope.\r\n\r\nBut they were many, and he was but one. Tomorrow—it would be too late.\r\n\r\nHead bowed in his hands, oblivious, at first he had heard it as a thin\r\nwhisper, like a knife blade against the silence; it penetrated inward\r\nnow, with the dull rasp of metal upon metal from without:\r\n\r\n“_Sit tight, old-timer; I’m comin’ through!_”\r\n\r\nThere came a muffled thud, a twist; Annister, reaching forth a hand,\r\nfound it clasped in thick groping fingers. Then, as he thrust head and\r\nshoulders through the sundered bars, a Shadow uprose, gigantic, against\r\nthe stars; the voice came again, in a quick, rumbling whisper:\r\n\r\n“It’s me, old-timer—_Bull_.”\r\n\r\nAnnister, crawling through the opening, alighted upon soft turf. He heard\r\nEllison’s low chuckle as, following the giant, he passed along the lee of\r\nthe building to where, showing merely as a black blot against the night,\r\nthere stood an automobile, its engine just turning over, with the low,\r\neven purr of harnessed power; at twenty paces it was scarcely audible\r\nabove the rising of the wind.\r\n\r\n“Tank’s full,” said Ellison. “Now—”\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly as a dim figure rose upward just beyond. For a moment\r\nAnnister set himself for the onslaught; then his hand went out; it\r\ngripped the hard hand of Del Kane.\r\n\r\n“Ellison done told me, Mr. Annister,” he said. “An’ so I come a-fannin’\r\nan’ a-foggin’ thisaway from Mojave; certain-sure I don’t aim to leave no\r\nfriend of mine hog-tied in no calaboose!”\r\n\r\nAnnister, his heart warming to these friends, debated with himself; then\r\nturned to Ellison with a sudden movement.\r\n\r\n“Bull,” he said. “I’m putting my cards on the table with you and Del,\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nHe told them briefly of the message from Mary, the need of haste; then,\r\nof his mission, and of the help that was even now due, or would be, with\r\nthe morning. If they were coming with him, northward along that road of\r\nperil, word must be left behind.\r\n\r\nKane thought a moment; then, wheeling swiftly, with muttered word, he\r\ndisappeared in the darkness, to return presently with the good news that\r\nhe had fixed it with the station-agent. The latter had just come on; he\r\nwas a friend of Kane’s, and no friend of Rook and Company; he would see\r\nto it, Kane said, that the reinforcements would be warned.\r\n\r\nBoarding the car, they swung out cautiously along the silent street,\r\nunder the pale stars, northward along that shadowy road. Presently there\r\nwould be a moon, but just now they went onward in a thick darkness, with,\r\njust ahead, the dim loom of the road, flowing backward under the wheels,\r\nwhich presently ran like a ribbon of pale flame under the bright beam of\r\nthe lights.\r\n\r\nA half mile from the town, and Bull, who was driving, opened up, and the\r\ncar leaped forward with the rising drone of the powerful motor, thirty,\r\nforty, fifty miles an hour; the wind of their passage drove backward like\r\na wall as the giant’s voice came now in a rumbling laugh:\r\n\r\n“Some little speed-wagon, Mr. Annister, ha?” he said. “An’ that’s\r\nwhatever! It ought to be. The man who owns it—who _did_ own it half an\r\nhour ago—he’s some particular, I’ll say! Because—it’s Mister Hamilton\r\nRook’s!”\r\n\r\nAnnister laughed grimly in answer, speaking a low word of caution as,\r\nafter perhaps a half hour of their racing onrush the lights glimmered on\r\ndark trees to right and left.\r\n\r\n“Somewhere about here, I think,” he said, low. “Three outside guards, I\r\nunderstand. We’d better stop a little way this side, Bull ... that’s it.\r\nNow, look!”\r\n\r\nAs the big car slid slowly to a halt, the moon, rising above the trees,\r\nshowed them, perhaps a hundred yards just ahead, a low, rambling, stone\r\nhouse, its windows like blind eyes to the night. Upon its roof the\r\nmoonlight lay like snow, and even at that distance it was sinister,\r\nforbidding, as if the evil that was within had seeped through those\r\nstones, outward, in a creeping tide.\r\n\r\n“Looks like a morgue,” offered Ellison, with a shrug of his great\r\nshoulders, as the three, alighting, pushed the car before them into the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThen, guns out, they went forward slowly among the trees.\r\n\r\nAnnister had formed no definite plan of attack. The red ribbon at that\r\nwindow-bar might or might not be visible under the moon, but, the guards\r\neliminated, it seemed to him that, after all, they would have to make\r\nit an assault in force. Pondering this matter, of a sudden he leaped\r\nsidewise as a dim figure rose upward almost in his face.\r\n\r\nSpread-eagled like a bat against the dimness, the figure bulked, huge,\r\nagainst the moon as Annister, bending to one side, brought up his fist in\r\na lifting punch, from his shoe-tops.\r\n\r\nIt was a savage blow; it landed with the sound of a butcher’s cleaver on\r\nthe chopping-block; there came a gasping grunt; the thud of a heavy body,\r\nas the guard went downward without a sound.\r\n\r\n“One!” breathed Ellison, as, trussing their victim with a length of\r\nstout line brought from the car, they left him, going forward carefully,\r\nkeeping together, circling the house.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until they were half way round it, with, so far, no sign\r\nof that signal for which he looked, that they encountered the second\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nHe came upon them with a swift, silent onrush, leaping among the trees,\r\na great, dun shape, spectral under the moon, fangs bared, as, without a\r\nsound, the hound drove straight for the giant’s throat.\r\n\r\nA shot would bring discovery; they dared not risk it. Annister could see\r\nthe great head, the wide ruff at the neck, the grinning jaws.... Then,\r\nthe giant’s hands had gone up and out; there came a straining heave, a\r\nwrench, a queer, whistling croak; Ellison, rising from his knees, looked\r\ndownward a moment to where the beast, its jaw broken by that mighty\r\nstrength, lay stretched, lifeless, at his feet.\r\n\r\nBy now they had come full circle, when, all at once, Annister, peering\r\nunder his hand, sucked in his breath with a whispered oath.\r\n\r\nFair against the bars of a window, low down at their right, there was a\r\ndark smudge; the ribbon, black under the moon. Annister’s heart leaped up\r\nin answer, as, with a quick word, he halted his companions in the shadow\r\nof a tree. A moment they conferred; then Ellison—and Annister could\r\nalmost see his grin in the darkness—spoke beneath his hand:\r\n\r\n“Why, that’ll be easy! I’ve got m’ tools; they’re right here in my\r\npocket, Mr. Annister! Those bars ought to be easy! For a fair journeyman\r\nsledge-swinger, it’ll be easy an’ you can lay to that!”\r\n\r\n“Good!” whispered Annister in answer. “But—hurry!”\r\n\r\nThe moonlight lay in a molten flood between them and the house. But\r\nit was no time now for deliberation. Crossing that bright strip at a\r\ncrouching run, the three were at the window; Annister’s harsh whisper\r\nhissed in the silence, through those iron bars:\r\n\r\n“_Mary!_”\r\n\r\nFor a heart-beat silence answered him; then, faint and thin, in a faint,\r\ntremulous, sobbing breath, there came the answer:\r\n\r\n“Steve—thank God!”\r\n\r\nAnnister had spoken the girl’s name without thought. At that high moment\r\nforms had been futile; that whisper had been wrung from him, deep-down,\r\nas had her answer. And then the soft rasp of steel on steel told that\r\nEllison was at work.\r\n\r\nBut the giant was working against time. At any moment now might come the\r\nalarm; they had no means of knowing the number of those within those\r\nwalls; perhaps even now peril, just behind, might be stalking them, out\r\nof the dark.\r\n\r\nAnd still that soft rasp went on, until, at a low word from the girl, the\r\ngiant, laying down his file, bent, heaved, putting his shoulder into it;\r\nand the bars sprang outward, bent and twisted in that iron grasp.\r\n\r\nAnnister, his hand reaching for the hand of the girl, went inward\r\nsilently, to stand a moment, without speech, in the thick darkness of the\r\nlittle cell. But it was no time for dalliance.\r\n\r\nKane and Ellison behind him now, he set his shoulder against the door,\r\nas, Ellison aiding, it splintered outward with a soft, carrying crash.\r\nAhead of them, along a dark, narrow corridor, there had come on a sudden\r\nsound of voices, murmurs; Annister, going toward that sound, saw suddenly\r\nan open door; light streamed from it as the murmur of voices rose:\r\n\r\n“My friend, I bring you—forgetfulness....”\r\n\r\nThe words came in a sort of hissing sibilance as Annister, reaching that\r\ndoorway, halted a moment as the tableau was burned into his brain:\r\n\r\nHe saw his father, helpless, his face gray with the hideous terror of\r\nthat which was upon him, in the grasp of two cloaked and hooded figures,\r\ntheir dark faces grinning with a bestial mirth.\r\n\r\nAnd before him, hand upraised and holding a curious, funnel-shaped object\r\nat which the man in the corner shrank backward even as he looked, he saw\r\na tall man with a black, forking beard—the same that he had seen that\r\nevening at the corner of the street; the same that he had seen in that\r\ndim backwater of Rangoon, the Unspeakable—the man with the dark, foreign\r\nvisage, and the eyes of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER THIRTEEN_\r\n\r\nTHE JAILER OF SOULS\r\n\r\nAnnister’s gun went up and out as the black-bearded man, turning, saw him\r\nwhere he stood.\r\n\r\nTravis Annister, parchment-pale, took two forward, lurching steps, as\r\nthe doctor, backing stiffly against the wall, hands upraised, called\r\nsomething in a high sing-song, savage, inarticulate.\r\n\r\nThen—everything seemed to happen at once. A snarling, animal outcry\r\nechoed from the passage just without; it rose, as there came a far,\r\ngobbling mutter of voices, and the _pad-pad_ of running feet.\r\n\r\nThe hooded Familiars, as one man, turned, and the long knives flashed,\r\nluminous, under the lights, as Kane and Ellison, meeting them half way,\r\nraised their heavy guns.\r\n\r\nAnnister, covering the Doctor, froze suddenly in motion as that gobbling\r\nhorror mounted, and then, filling that narrow way like figures in a\r\ndream, they came: the outcasts, the lost battalion, the Men Who Had no\r\nRight to Live.\r\n\r\nIn their van, but running rather as if pursued than as if in answer to\r\nthat snarling call, there came three men, guards by their dress, their\r\nfaces contorted, agonized, upon them the impress of a crawling fear. They\r\nstreamed past that door, pursuers and pursued, as Black Steve Annister,\r\nfinger upon the trigger of his pistol, saw that lean hand sweep upward;\r\nit flicked the thin lips; the dark face grayed, went blank; the Dark\r\nDoctor, his gaze in a queer, frozen look upon Eternity, pitched forward\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\nIn some way, as Annister could understand, the madmen had won free,\r\nbut—how?\r\n\r\nTurning, he saw a white face at his elbow as there sounded from without\r\nthe staccato explosions of a motor, and a swift, hammering thunder upon\r\nthe great door.\r\n\r\n“I am—Newbold Humiston,” said the face, “and I am not mad, or, rather, I\r\nam but mad north-north-west when the wind is southerly,” he quoted, with\r\na ghastly smile. “This devil—” he pointed to the body of Elphinstone—“has\r\ngone to his own place, but the evil that he did lives after him—in _us_.”\r\n\r\nHis voice rose to a shriek as there came a rush of feet along the\r\ncorridor: a compact body of men, at their head a tall man at sight of\r\nwhom Stephen Annister flung up a hand.\r\n\r\n“Well, Childers,” he said. “I’m glad!”\r\n\r\nChilders spoke pantingly, in quick gasps:\r\n\r\n“We just made it, old man,” he said. “A day ahead at that. The station\r\nagent put us on the track. We got ’em all—Lunn, and the rest; all but\r\nRook—”\r\n\r\nHe paused, at Annister’s inquiring look, turning his thumb down with an\r\nexpressive gesture.\r\n\r\n“We found him—strangled—in his office ... a queer business....”\r\n\r\nAnnister gave an exclamation.\r\n\r\n“The Indian!” he said. “Well, Rook was the ‘Third Light,’ sure enough!”\r\n\r\nAgain he was seeing the lean, avid face in the vestibule of the smoker,\r\nthe lighted match; himself, and the conductor, and Rook, the lawyer’s\r\npale eyes brooding above the glowing end of his cigarette.... And again,\r\nas the picture passed, he was aware of the white face at his elbow as\r\nMary Allerton, her hand in his, behind her the golden hair and the wide\r\neyes of Cleo Ridgley, turned to Childers with a smile that yet had in it\r\na hint of tears.\r\n\r\nHe that had been Newbold Humiston continued:\r\n\r\n“The others—they’re quiet now. The guards have gone—to follow _him_—the\r\nothers saw to that.”\r\n\r\nHe gestured toward the silent figure on the floor.\r\n\r\n“His plan was worthy of his master, the Devil, because it was\r\ndiabolically simple: Rook was his procurer and his clearing-house; you\r\nsee, Rook found the victims, and cashed the checks that Elphinstone wrung\r\nfrom them; and then, when they had cleaned up, or when they deemed the\r\ntime was ripe, the victims—disappeared. Rook’s secretary they kidnapped\r\nfor revenge; Miss Allerton because she knew much; they suspected that she\r\nwas in the Secret Service. And so—these others disappeared.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed; the laugh of a dead man risen from the tomb.\r\n\r\n“They disappeared—yes—but—they remained, as you see—myself—a living\r\nghost!”\r\n\r\n“But how?” asked the younger Annister, in the sudden quiet, the\r\nrealization of what his father and Mary had escaped burning like a quick\r\nfire in his veins. The toneless voice went on:\r\n\r\n“Elphinstone was a surgeon, a master.... You’ve heard of Dermatology?\r\nWell, it’s been done in India, I believe; practiced there to an extent\r\nunknown here, of course. An anesthetic, and then an operation: new faces\r\nfor old, forged faces; the thing was diabolically simple. And so when\r\nthey, the victims, saw themselves in a mirror, sometimes they went mad,\r\nfor who could prove it? Who would be believed?”\r\n\r\nHis voice rose, died, gathered strength, as a candle flames at the last\r\nwith a brief spark of life:\r\n\r\n“It’s done,” he muttered. “He’s gone—but his work lives after him, even\r\nas he called himself—the Jailer of Souls!”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor Baffled by Weird Seance\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle’s lecture tours in the United States have created\r\nwide discussion and considerable difference of opinion, some persons\r\ncontending that he is really in communication with the spirit world,\r\nwhile others declare that he is the victim of tricksters. In order to\r\nconduct an impartial investigation, J. Malcolm Bird, associate editor\r\nof The Scientific American, attended several of Sir Arthur’s seances,\r\nand afterward declared that he had observed psychic phenomena that\r\ncould hardly be explained by any known natural cause. He could discover\r\nno physical connection between the medium or the spectators and the\r\nphenomena, and he saw mysterious self-luminous lights, attributed by Sir\r\nArthur to ectoplasm, and heard strange noises that defied his efforts to\r\nestablish a natural cause.\r\n\r\n“My best judgment would be that both in direction and subject matter much\r\nof the ‘communicated’ material of the seance would be quite beyond the\r\nnormal ability of the medium,” he said. “The seance entered a phase which\r\nseems to me to prove, without question, that telepathy or some other\r\nforce with intelligence behind it was at work.\r\n\r\n“The trumpet began to talk, loudly and distinctly and coherently, in a\r\nvoice that had not yet been heard.... It was not ordinary ventriloquism,\r\nbecause the ventriloquist cannot work in the dark. He doesn’t deceive\r\nyour ears, but rather your eyes, by directing your attention to the point\r\nwhence he wishes you to infer that the sound came. The voice really came\r\nfrom the center of the circle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK O’ MYSTERY\r\n\r\n_A Modern Ghost Story_\r\n\r\n_By_ EDWIN MacLAREN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe limousine came to a glistening stop before an office building in\r\nMonroe Street, and a handsome woman of thirty, expensively and stylishly\r\ngowned, emerged from the car and entered the building, her mien\r\nbespeaking nervousness.\r\n\r\nFurtively, as one who fears pursuit, she hastened across the marble\r\nrotunda, edged hurriedly into an elevator and ascended to the ninth\r\nfloor, where she approached a door bearing upon its opaque glass panel\r\nthe gilt lettering:\r\n\r\n                          BARRY DETECTIVE AGENCY\r\n\r\nShe paused here for a moment, in an effort to recover her equanimity; and\r\nthen, with a brave assumption of self-assurance, she opened the door and\r\nentered the room and closed the door behind her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe room was quite deserted; but promptly from an adjoining chamber there\r\ncame a lean-faced young man of inquiring blue eyes, who courteously\r\ngreeted her.\r\n\r\n“Is Mr. Barry in?” she asked. “Mr. Herbert Barry?”\r\n\r\n“I am Herbert Barry,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Surprised, she eyed the slim young man half incredulously. He\r\nseemed scarcely more than a boy. “Mrs. Franklin Parker told me about\r\nyou—recommended you very highly. Perhaps that is why,” she added, with a\r\nsmile, “I expected to find an older man.... I suppose most of the people\r\nwho come to see you are in trouble of some sort. _I_ am not in trouble,\r\nexactly, but—” She glanced around the office. “May I have a word with you\r\nin privacy?”\r\n\r\nHe held open the door to the adjoining room. “Suppose we step in here? My\r\nstenographer is at lunch. There’s no danger of our being disturbed.”\r\n\r\nPreceding him into the inner office, she bade him lock the door; and,\r\nthus assured of their safety from interruption, she sat nervously on\r\nthe edge of a chair and faced him across the flat-top desk. There\r\nclung to her, somehow, a subtle suggestion of wealth and luxury, and\r\nher well-chiseled features denoted good breeding. Subtle, too, was the\r\ndelicate odor of violets that fragrantly touched his nostrils as she\r\nleaned toward him across the desk. Then he noticed she wore a rich\r\ncluster of the flowers upon her mauve silk waist.\r\n\r\nHe observed, also, the purplish shadows beneath her large brown eyes,\r\nher half-frightened, half-worried demeanor and her air of suppressed\r\nexcitement, as though she were struggling to control some inner\r\nperturbation.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I’ve made a mistake,” she began, “in coming here. I don’t know.\r\nBut I’ve been so perplexed, so utterly mystified, by some strange things\r\nthat have happened lately—Did you ever hear of Willard Clayberg?” she\r\nbroke off suddenly to ask.\r\n\r\nBarry knitted his brows. The name had a familiar sound.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, after a pause, “I seem to remember him. Wasn’t he the\r\nNorth Shore millionaire who went insane last winter and killed his wife\r\nand himself?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded. Her elbows were resting on the desk and her slender fingers,\r\ninterlaced beneath her small white chin, were twitching.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. They lived, as you probably recall, in a quaint old-fashioned\r\nhome near Hubbard Woods—just the two of them; no children. Following\r\nthe tragedy, the house was closed up and for a long while remained\r\nunoccupied. Despite the scarcity of dwelling places, nobody apparently\r\ncared to live there. For one thing, it is not a modern residence, and for\r\nanother—and this really seemed the most serious objection—it had acquired\r\na reputation of being ‘haunted.’\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she went on, with a nervous little laugh, “you will say—just\r\nas _I_ said—that such a thing is perfectly absurd. You’d think that no\r\nnormal person would take it seriously. And yet there were so many strange\r\nthings told about the house—creepy stories of weird sounds in the dead\r\nof night and unearthly things seen through the windows—that people,\r\nordinarily level-headed, began to shun the place.\r\n\r\n“I have never believed in ghosts, Mr. Barry, and I’ve always ridiculed\r\npeople who did; but now—Do you know my husband, Scott Peyton?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard of him,” said Barry. “Architect, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“A very successful one. He has designed some of the finest buildings in\r\nChicago. But he’s the most superstitious man alive! He’s a Southerner,\r\nborn in Georgia, and at childhood his negro ‘mammy’ filled his mind with\r\nall manner of silly superstitions, including a deathly fear of ‘ha’nts.’\r\nHe has never been able to overcome this, although both of us have tried.\r\n\r\n“About three weeks ago,” Mrs. Peyton continued, her voice betraying her\r\nagitation, “he and I were motoring along the North Shore when we espied\r\nthis old Clayberg estate. The quaint charm of the old-fashioned place at\r\nonce enchanted me; and when we alighted and strolled through the grounds\r\nmy enchantment grew. It seemed as if Nature had outdone herself in\r\nlavishing picturesque beauty there. Mr. Peyton was as fascinated as I.\r\n\r\n“We were planning, at that time, to give up our town apartment and buy a\r\nsuburban home; and this seemed to be just the thing we were looking for.\r\nWe inquired of the neighbors concerning it, and it was then we discovered\r\nits tragic history. When my husband was told of the hideous thing that\r\nhad happened there last winter, and of its evil reputation since, his\r\nenthusiasm vanished, and I immediately saw he would never consider buying\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“But I had set my heart on having that place; and later—after I had\r\npleaded and argued with him in vain—I decided to buy it myself and,\r\nby compelling him to live there, perhaps cure him permanently of his\r\nsuperstitious fear. I saw the agent next day, learned the old home could\r\nbe bought at a bargain, and had my father buy it and deed it to me.\r\n\r\n“My husband was furious when I told him what I had done. He declared\r\nhe would never enter the house and urged me to sell it forthwith. But\r\nI was as firm as he; and finally, after a rather violent argument and\r\nby taunting him with being a coward, I contrived to get his reluctant\r\nconsent to make our home in the ‘haunted house’.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“We moved in last Thursday,” said Mrs. Peyton sitting nearer the desk and\r\nlowering her voice, “and on Thursday night, and every night since then—”\r\nShe exhaled audibly, her lip quivering.\r\n\r\n“What happened?” asked Barry.\r\n\r\n“It’s been a nightmare!” she exclaimed with sudden vehemence. “Ever since\r\nthat first night the most peculiar things have happened. I don’t know\r\nwhat to make of it, or what to think, or do. It’s baffling! I’m not in\r\nthe least superstitious; and yet—”\r\n\r\n“Start at the beginning,” suggested Barry, “and tell me exactly what\r\nhappened.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the first night we slept in the master’s bedroom—a large front\r\nroom on the second floor—and about midnight I was awakened by my husband,\r\nwho was sitting up in bed, gasping and trembling with terror. Before\r\nI could speak, he sprang from bed and switched on the light and began\r\nfrantically searching the room, looking into the closets and under the\r\nbed and peering into the hall.\r\n\r\n“‘For heaven’s sake!’ I cried. ‘What’s the matter?’\r\n\r\n“He pointed to the corridor door. His hand was trembling and his face was\r\nas white as paper. For a moment he seemed unable to speak.\r\n\r\n“‘It came right through that door!’ he said at last. ‘I woke up just as\r\nit came in the room—a ghastly-looking old man with white hair and a long\r\nbeard. It didn’t open the door, but came right _through_ it!’\r\n\r\n“‘Nonsense!’ I laughed. ‘You’ve been thinking about ghosts until you\r\nimagine you’re seeing them. Now come back to bed and go to sleep.’\r\n\r\n“But he indignantly insisted he had actually seen the thing.\r\n\r\n“‘I saw it cross the room,’ he declared, ‘and stop at the bed and stand\r\nthere looking down at me. When I sat up it disappeared—vanished into air.’\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t believe such a preposterous thing, of course, but, to humor\r\nhim, I offered to get up and help him search the house.\r\n\r\n“‘What good would that do?’ he objected. ‘I tell you the thing was a\r\n_spirit_!’\r\n\r\n“Finally he went back to bed. But he slept no more that night. At\r\nbreakfast next morning I could see he hadn’t closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“On the following night I again was awakened by my husband, who seemed\r\neven more frightened than before.\r\n\r\n“‘It came back again!’ he whispered hoarsely. ‘It was puttering around\r\nyour desk over there.’\r\n\r\n“Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the desk and lit the lamp there.\r\nA moment later he uttered a sharp cry and came hurrying back to my bed,\r\nwith a sheet of writing paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n“‘Look at that!’ he exclaimed, and thrust the paper before my eyes.\r\n\r\n“I saw written on the paper, in a sprawling hand, the words, ‘_Leave this\r\nHouse!_’ and I knew then that somebody had been in the room.\r\n\r\n“I got up and tried the door. It was still locked and the key was in the\r\nhole, just as I had left it. The windows hadn’t been touched, apparently.\r\nHow, then, had the person entered our room?\r\n\r\n“My husband, of course, insisted it was not a living being, but a ghost,\r\nwho could pass through a locked door as though it didn’t exist. And, as\r\nbefore, he refused to look for it.\r\n\r\n“Next day, however, with our cook and houseman, I thoroughly searched the\r\nhouse from top to bottom—and found nothing. No trace of anybody having\r\nentered the house. Nothing wrong anywhere.\r\n\r\n“On Saturday night I was awakened again—this time by a frantic knocking\r\non our bedroom door. I sat up, startled. My husband was sleeping soundly,\r\nexhausted after two sleepless nights.\r\n\r\n“I slipped quietly from bed, without disturbing him, and tiptoed to the\r\ndoor and whispered through the panel:\r\n\r\n“‘Who’s there?’\r\n\r\n“The cook’s voice answered, and I could tell by her tone she was terribly\r\nfrightened:\r\n\r\n“‘It’s me, ma’am. I’m leavin’ this house tonight. I won’t stay here\r\nanother minute!’\r\n\r\n“I opened the door and stepped out in the hall—taking care not to awake\r\nMr. Peyton—and found Clara fully dressed and holding her traveling-bag.\r\nIt was evident she had dressed in considerable haste, and it was equally\r\nplain that she was almost paralyzed with fear.\r\n\r\n“‘I just seen a spook!’ she gasped. ‘An old man with white hair and\r\nwhiskers. He come right in my room while I was asleep. I woke up and seen\r\n’im. And he writ somethin’ on my dresser. You c’n see for yerself, ma’am,\r\nwhat he writ there.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Fearful of awakening my husband, I had drawn her away from the bedroom\r\ndoor; and now, with some difficulty, I persuaded her to follow me to her\r\nroom, where I found, written in white chalk across the bureau mirror, the\r\ncommand: ‘_Leave here at once!_’\r\n\r\n“Clara was determined to obey this ‘message from the dead’ by leaving\r\ninstantly. I couldn’t induce her even to stay until morning. Despite my\r\nprotests and entreaties, she fled from the house and passed the remainder\r\nof the night, as I later discovered, in the Hubbard Woods railroad\r\nstation, taking an early train for Chicago.\r\n\r\n“I tried to keep the occurrence from my husband, inventing an excuse for\r\nClara’s hasty departure, but he wormed the truth from me, and of course\r\nthat further harassed his already overwrought nerves. Also, it gave him\r\nthe right to say, ‘I told you so!’\r\n\r\n“He renewed his pleading to abandon the house; but I still refused to\r\ngive it up—still refused to admit that it was ‘haunted,’ or that there\r\nwas anything supernatural in what he and Clara had seen.\r\n\r\n“It didn’t end there, unhappily. On the very next night—that was night\r\nbefore last—the houseman was visited by the mysterious ‘thing.’ He said\r\nhe saw it in his room, after midnight, stooping over his table, that he\r\nshouted at it and it disappeared. Then, so he told us, he got up and\r\nstruck a light and discovered the ‘ghost’ had been trying to send a\r\nmessage to him by arranging some matches on the table.\r\n\r\n“He showed us these matches, saying he had left them just as they were\r\nfound. They were so placed as to spell the word, ‘_LEAVE_,’ in capital\r\nletters. Evidently the ‘ghost’ was frightened away before he could finish\r\nhis sentence. Needless to say, the houseman left us.\r\n\r\n“Well, in spite of all these things, I simply couldn’t bring myself to\r\nbelieve that the mysterious visitations were supernatural. I was sure\r\nthere must be some logical explanation. But _last_ night—!”\r\n\r\n“What happened last night?” asked Barry, as Mrs. Peyton paused.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peyton, still sitting forward in her chair, was searching in her\r\nreticule. Barry noticed her fingers were unsteady and that her underlip\r\nwas caught between her teeth to still its quivering.\r\n\r\n“Last night,” she went on, with a transparent effort at lightness, “_I_\r\nsaw the ‘ghost’! Please don’t smile! I was quite wide awake when I saw\r\nit—as wide awake as I am this moment—and in full possession of all my\r\nwits. And I can’t understand yet how it got in my room, or how it got\r\nout, or even what it was.\r\n\r\n“I was alone in the house, too,” she continued, taking a photograph from\r\nthe reticule and placing it, face down, on the desk. “Yesterday afternoon\r\nMr. Peyton telephoned from his office that he must stay downtown rather\r\nlate to attend a meeting of building contractors and suggested that I\r\ncome in to the city for dinner, and bring a friend and ‘take in a show,’\r\nand meet him afterward. But I wasn’t in the mood and told him I’d prefer\r\nto stay at home.\r\n\r\n“‘But I won’t be home before twelve o’clock,’ he said, ‘and I don’t like\r\nthe idea of your being all alone in that house at night, without even a\r\nservant on the place.’\r\n\r\n“I reminded him that the chauffeur and gardener were still with us (they\r\nsleep in the garage and hadn’t been alarmed by the ‘spook’), and with\r\nthese two and Mitch, our Scotch collie, to guard me I felt perfectly\r\nsafe. As for the ‘ghost,’ I laughingly told him, I really would enjoy\r\nmeeting it and having a chat on its astral adventures.\r\n\r\n“He declined to unbend from his seriousness and became irritated when I\r\nrefused to leave the house. We had quite a tiff, but I finally had my\r\nway, and the best he could get was a promise from me to lock myself in\r\nbefore going to bed. He said he would sleep in one of the guest chambers.\r\n\r\n“After a pick-up meal in the kitchen, I went upstairs to our room and\r\nwrote letters until ten o’clock. Then I prepared for bed.\r\n\r\n“For a moment I regretted not having done as my husband asked. The house\r\n_did_ seem eerie; no denying that—big and dark and silent, and not a\r\nliving creature in it except myself.\r\n\r\n“But I quickly shook off this feeling, assuring myself there was no such\r\nthing as a ghost, and, even if there was, that it couldn’t possibly\r\nharm me. However, remembering my promise, I locked the door and put the\r\nkey under my pillow, and bolted all the windows, and, as an additional\r\nprecaution, I looked under the bed and inspected both closets. And I knew\r\n_absolutely_, when I put out the light and got into bed, that I was the\r\nonly person in that room.\r\n\r\n“I was soon asleep,” said Mrs. Peyton, again feeling in her handbag,\r\n“and it seemed only a few minutes later—though I know now it was several\r\nhours—when I found myself wide awake. I suppose it was the lack of fresh\r\nair that awoke me. I’m accustomed to sleeping with the windows open.\r\n\r\n“I was on the point of getting up to open a window when, all at once, my\r\nblood seemed to freeze. I discovered, quite suddenly, _I was not alone in\r\nthe room_!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Peyton paused and drew from the handbag a sheet of blue linen\r\nnotepaper. Nervously creasing the paper in her slender white fingers, she\r\ncontinued, with heightening agitation, her large brown eyes earnestly\r\nwatching the detective’s face: “I won’t deny, Mr. Berry, that I was\r\nfrightened. In fact, I confess that I was so terrified I seemed utterly\r\npowerless to move or speak. I had always supposed if I ever _should_\r\nsee a ghost I would feel no fear whatever. But now that I found myself\r\nactually looking at one—or at least looking at what, in that frightful\r\nmoment, I potently _believed_ to be one—I was petrified with terror.\r\n\r\n“It was sitting at my desk, right where I’d been sitting all evening, and\r\nits back was toward me. The moon had risen and was shining through the\r\nwindows, brightening the room with a pale half-light.\r\n\r\n“The figure at the desk appeared to be writing. In fact, I could hear the\r\nscratching of the pen. I could also hear the ticking of a small clock on\r\nthe desk. That’s how still everything was.\r\n\r\n“Well, it sat there writing—a blurred, shapeless object in the silvery\r\nmoonlight—for I don’t know how long. It seemed an age! And all the time I\r\nwas conscious—terrifyingly so—that I was alone in that great house with\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Peyton paused and took the photograph from the desk.\r\n\r\n“Instinctively, I tried to scream,” she went on, “but my throat was\r\nparched and I seemed unable to utter a sound. However, I must have made\r\nsome sort of noise, for the thing suddenly turned and looked at me over\r\nits shoulder. And for the first time, I saw its face.”\r\n\r\n“What was the face like?” asked Barry.\r\n\r\nShe handed him the photograph.\r\n\r\n“That’s a picture of it,” she said.\r\n\r\nIt was a kodak “snapshot” of an aged man with flowing white hair and\r\na patriarchal beard. Turning it over, Barry saw written on the back,\r\n“Willard Clayberg, December, 1922.”\r\n\r\n“It’s Mr. Clayberg’s last picture,” said Mrs. Peyton. “I obtained it this\r\nmorning from one of his grandsons. It was taken last winter, shortly\r\nbefore the dreadful tragedy at our house.”\r\n\r\n“Getting back to last night?” reminded Barry.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! Well, the thing sat there, quite silent and motionless, staring\r\nat me through the moonlight. Its face was the same as the one in that\r\npicture, only, somehow, it didn’t seem _real_. It was peculiarly pallid\r\nand lifeless—like the face of a dead person.\r\n\r\n“Finally I found my voice and cried out: ‘Who are you? What are you doing\r\nhere?’\r\n\r\n“Instantly the thing rose from the desk, without making a particle of\r\nsound, and glided swiftly and silently across the room—and disappeared!\r\n\r\n“That seemed to revive my courage—the thought that I had frightened it\r\naway—and I sprang from bed and ran to the door.\r\n\r\n“The door was still locked! I tried the windows. They were still bolted.\r\nNeither the door nor the windows had been touched. Everything in the\r\nroom, in fact, was just as I had left it upon going to bed.\r\n\r\n“Then I crossed to my desk and lit the lamp there and found—this!” Mrs.\r\nPeyton offered the sheet of note paper, which she had been nervously\r\nfingering.\r\n\r\nBarry unfolded it and read the words scrawled upon its blue surface:\r\n\r\n    “_Again I warn you to leave this house. This is the last—_”\r\n\r\n“When I interrupted him,” explained Mrs. Peyton, “he apparently had just\r\nwritten the word, ‘last.’”\r\n\r\nBarry nodded and narrowly examined the handwriting. It was old-style\r\nscript, angular and shaky, indicative of a very aged and infirm person.\r\n\r\n“Have you the notes received by Mr. Peyton and the cook?”\r\n\r\n“No; but I saw them. Both were written in the same hand as that,”\r\nindicating the sheet of blue paper.\r\n\r\nBarry again looked at the photograph, holding it to the light and\r\ninspecting it closely. Suddenly he asked:\r\n\r\n“What sort of clothing did your visitor wear?”\r\n\r\n“Why, as I remember, he wore a sort of long gray robe and a queer little\r\ncap—a skullcap, maybe. But it was all very blurred and indistinct. He\r\nseemed to be enveloped in a kind of gray mist. With his white hair and\r\nbeard, the effect was quite ‘creepy.’”\r\n\r\n“Anything else happen last night?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing—except that I passed the rest of the night trying to solve the\r\nriddle. The first thing I did, after finding the note, was to try the\r\ndoor and windows again—and I again made sure they hadn’t been touched. I\r\nknew positively that nobody could get in the room _except_ through the\r\ndoor or windows, so _how_ had the old man entered?\r\n\r\n“I was still hunting an answer to that question, and growing more\r\nperplexed than ever, when I heard a heavy footfall on the front porch;\r\nthen the front door opened and closed with a _bang_, and my husband came\r\nbounding noisily upstairs. I knew from this he had seen the light at my\r\nwindow, even before he called to me reprovingly through the bedroom door:\r\n‘Haven’t you turned in yet? It’s ’way after one o’clock.’\r\n\r\n“It was then I decided to say nothing to him about what happened. And I\r\nhaven’t.\r\n\r\n“But this morning, as soon as he’d left for the office, I called on Mrs.\r\nParker and told her everything. She suggested that I see you. I hesitated\r\nat first to do this, because only yesterday I spoke to Mr. Peyton\r\nabout calling in the police or employing a detective to investigate\r\nthe mystery, and he vigorously objected. He really believed the thing\r\nwas supernatural and declared that no living person could overcome it.\r\nThe only thing to do, he said, was to leave the house as the ‘spirit’\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\n“I finally decided, however, to follow Mrs. Parker’s suggestion,\r\nparticularly as she recommended you so highly—and so, quite unknown to my\r\nhusband, here I am!\r\n\r\n“And now, Mr. Barry,” said Mrs. Peyton, sitting back in her chair for\r\nthe first time and moving her white hands in a pretty gesture of relief,\r\n“what do _you_ make of it all?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarry, examining the feeble handwriting beneath a reading-glass,\r\ndiscerned what appeared to be a startling solution of the mystery; but,\r\ndeeming it best for the moment to say nothing of this, he offered an\r\nobvious answer to her question:\r\n\r\n“From what you have told me, Mrs. Peyton, it would seem that an unknown\r\nperson, concealed in your house, is bent on frightening you away.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve thoroughly searched the house,” she protested, “not once, but\r\nseveral times; and I know positively that nobody is hidden there—and that\r\nnobody has broken in. Besides, even if the old man _was_ in the house, or\r\n_had_ broken in, how did he enter my room last night?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, after I’ve inspected the room—”\r\n\r\n“Can you do it, without Mr. Peyton knowing?”\r\n\r\n“Quite easily, I think, with our help. Since you are in need of servants,\r\nmy presence can readily be explained—”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course!” she eagerly interrupted. “Our new houseman! It will\r\nseem quite plausible, too,” she added, rising and glancing at her watch,\r\n“particularly since I’ve just engaged a new cook—who is waiting for me\r\nnow, by the way, in my car. We had best start at once, Mr. Barry. It’s\r\nnearly one, and my husband is usually home before six.”\r\n\r\n... A little later, as the Peyton limousine smartly threaded its way\r\nthrough the downtown streets, Barry, sitting on the front seat beside\r\nthe chauffeur, planned a procedure that would either substantiate, or\r\nexplode, his tentative explanation of the white-bearded “ghost.”\r\n\r\nHis first step was taken immediately: At a State Street department store\r\nhe secretly bought a pad of cheap writing paper, a package of ungummed\r\nenvelopes, ten two-cent stamps, a thick lead pencil, a jar of mucilage\r\nand an oblong carton of sterilized gauze.\r\n\r\nLater still, upon reaching the “haunted house,” he saw no cause to revise\r\nhis plan, and no reason to doubt that the solution he already had formed,\r\nalthough amazing, was essentially correct.\r\n\r\nWith the new cook installed in the kitchen, Mrs. Peyton conducted him to\r\nthe second-floor front bedroom—a commodious south chamber—where she had\r\nseen the “ghost” last night. Barry looked at the small mahogany desk,\r\nsurveyed the white-enameled twin beds, measured their distance from the\r\ncorridor door and carefully examined the lock thereon.\r\n\r\nThen, swiftly though systematically, he searched the rest of the house\r\nand afterward strolled outdoors. Sauntering across the velvety lawns,\r\nbeneath the aged trees, he casually approached the garage some two\r\nhundred feet from the house. He had found nothing in the house, and now\r\nsaw nothing in the surrounding grounds, to suggest the weird things he\r\nhad heard. Here, to all appearance, was only an old-fashioned suburban\r\nhome dozing peacefully in the mellow sunshine of a midsummer afternoon.\r\n\r\nAt the garage, which aforetime had been a stable, he engaged in\r\nback-stairs gossip with Frank Dominick, the chauffeur—in the presence of\r\nthe gardener, John Hart, an uncommunicative person—and learned that both\r\nwere preparing to “give notice.”\r\n\r\n“We ain’t actually _seen_ old Clayberg’s ghost—at least not _yet_,” said\r\nDominick, “but we’ve heard enough about ’im and I guess he’ll be callin’\r\non us next. I guess the only reason we ain’t seen ’im before is because\r\nwe sleep up there,” pointing to the upper floor of the garage. “Take my\r\nadvice, friend, and don’t stay here over night. Am I right, John?”\r\n\r\nJohn Hart, a senile man, shifted his cud of tobacco and expectorated\r\nlavishly, thus contributing a fresh stain to his ragged white beard.\r\n\r\n“You’re right,” said he, and spoke no more.\r\n\r\nReturning to the house, Barry was given a white jacket and a pair of blue\r\ntrousers by Mrs. Peyton; and at six o’clock, wearing these garments and\r\na servile mien, he was laying the dinner table when the master of the\r\nhouse arrived. Barry, with a plate and napkin in his hands, observed him\r\nthrough the doorway—a trim-looking man of thirty-five—and remarked the\r\nharrowing fear that sat upon his countenance.\r\n\r\nHis haggard eyes, like those of his wife, denoted loss of sleep; and he\r\nevinced no interest in her “luck in finding two perfect servants.” In the\r\nsame troubled preoccupation, he acknowledged the introduction of Barry,\r\nwho was presented as Thomas Field. Clearly, he was too frightened and\r\nworried to be conscious of his environment.\r\n\r\nDinner over, Barry went to his room. It was a tiny chamber tucked\r\nunder the eaves at the rear of the top floor, and it was here that his\r\npredecessor had beheld the “apparition” night before last. Upon the small\r\ntable, where the word, “LEAVE” had been spelled with matches, Barry\r\nspread the articles which he had bought this afternoon.\r\n\r\nThen he drew the table to the window, and lighted the lamp, and sat down\r\nand began writing letters to mythical persons in Iowa. His door stood\r\nopen, and so did the window, and anybody passing in the hall, or standing\r\nnorth of the house, could have watched him at his employment.\r\n\r\nFor upward of two hours he sat steadily writing, his back to the door,\r\nhis face silhouetted against the window; and when he had written\r\nfive letters, and had stamped and directed them to his imaginary\r\ncorrespondents, he uncorked the mucilage pot and sealed the flaps of the\r\nenvelops.\r\n\r\nAnd then, somehow, he awkwardly upset the bottle of mucilage, and the\r\nstuff oozed stickily over his pencil and paper.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, or perhaps a little earlier, that he heard a\r\nslight rustle in the hall behind him, as of somebody moving away from his\r\ndoor, but, apparently intent only upon cleaning the mucilage from the\r\ntable, he never looked round or gave any sign that he heard.\r\n\r\nPresently he extinguished the light and, disrobing in the darkness,\r\nlooked from his window. The old Clayberg stable, now Peyton’s garage,\r\nloomed like a great dusky shadow in the starlit night; and at a small\r\nupper window, almost on a direct line with his, a yellow light glowed.\r\n\r\nFeeling through the dark, Barry removed the sterilized gauze from the\r\ncarton, snipped off a ten-inch length, and returned the gauze and box to\r\nhis pocket. Then he stretched his length on the narrow iron bed, his face\r\nto the window, his door ajar.\r\n\r\nWide awake, he lay staring into the darkness, his mind alert, sharpened\r\nby expectancy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moon rose in the southeast, bathing the outdoors in a silvery\r\nsheen and mitigating, somewhat, the darkness of his room. The minutes\r\nlengthened into hours; and as the hours dragged slowly by Barry fought\r\noff the desire to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe fight became increasingly difficult; and finally—he judged it was\r\nlong past midnight—it seemed as though he could no longer force himself\r\nto stay awake. His eyelids drooped. He dozed....\r\n\r\nAnd then, all at once, he was wide awake again, his pulse tingling.\r\nSomebody had entered his room and was standing now at the table, between\r\nthe bed and window, so near that Barry could have touched him by reaching\r\nforth his hand.\r\n\r\nBarry, however, remained motionless, simulating sleep; and beneath\r\nlowered lids he watched the intruder—a blurred gray figure—take up the\r\npencil and start writing on the pad of paper. The moon had climbed to the\r\nzenith, and by its pale reflection Barry distinguished the salient marks\r\nof his visitor; the long gray robe, the flowing white hair and beard, the\r\nwhite skullcap.\r\n\r\nThen the figure put down the pencil and vanished—gliding to the hall as\r\nswiftly and noiselessly, it seemed, as a shadow leaving the room.\r\n\r\nStill Barry did not move. Silence ensued. Then, from some point down the\r\nhall, came a woman’s piercing scream.\r\n\r\nBarry rose, wrapped the lead pencil in the strip of gauze, and enclosed\r\nit in the cardboard box and replaced the box in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThen, wearing coat and trousers, he stepped into the hall and lit a gas\r\njet there—just as the new cook, screaming with terror, emerged from her\r\nroom. Hysterical with fright, she frantically flourished a scrap of\r\nwrapping paper. And when she could speak coherently:\r\n\r\n“I just seen a spook in my room—an old man wid white whiskers. I won’t\r\nstay in this house! He writ somethin’ here—”\r\n\r\nShe broke off to examine the bit of paper by the fluttering gas flame;\r\nand when she saw the words written on her paper she uttered another\r\nterrified shriek and, heedless of her scant attire, fled toward the\r\nfront staircase. She was met at the head of the stairs by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPeyton—he in pajamas and bathrobe, she in a peignoir, and both visibly\r\nalarmed—and to them she told, or tried to tell, the reason for her mad\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n“Now lemme get outa here!” she ended, attempting to brush past them. “He\r\ntold me to leave tonight—and _I’m goin’_!”\r\n\r\nBarry, following sleepily in her wake, rubbing his eyes as one newly\r\nawakened from slumber, heard Peyton saying: “This is dreadful, dreadful!”\r\nand Mrs. Peyton entreating the cook to “stay at least till morning.”\r\n\r\nUnable to persuade the cook to remain, Mrs. Peyton turned appealingly to\r\nBarry. “Did you see anything in your room, Field?”\r\n\r\n“No, mem,” said Barry, hiding a yawn. “I was fast asleep when she woke me\r\nup, mem.”\r\n\r\nThis, however, exerted no influence on the cook. Like Clara who went\r\nbefore her, she departed immediately for the railroad station, there to\r\npass the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nPeace at last returned to the house—and Barry returned to his room,\r\nlocked the door and observed on his pad the same angular scrawl, “_Leave\r\nthis house tonight!_” which had frightened her away. Then he went to bed\r\nand slept soundly until after sunrise.\r\n\r\nHe was up and dressed at seven o’clock; and when the Peytons came\r\ndownstairs about eight he had an appetizing breakfast awaiting them. As\r\nsoon as her husband had left for his office, Mrs. Peyton, returning from\r\nthe front door, looked at the detective with anxious inquiry in her large\r\nbrown eyes.\r\n\r\n“Have you discovered anything at all, Mr. Barry?”\r\n\r\nBarry took a crumpled napkin from the breakfast table and folded it\r\nthoughtfully between his long fingers. He was thinking: “Yes, Mrs.\r\nPeyton; I’ve discovered the identity of your ‘ghost,’ and you alone have\r\nthe power to ‘kill’ it.” Aloud, however:\r\n\r\n“I’ll make a report today,” he promised, and left the room with a stack\r\nof dishes and the folded napkin.\r\n\r\nHe deposited the dishes in the kitchen sink. The napkin went into his hip\r\npocket. Then he started upstairs for his other clothes. At her bedroom\r\ndoor he paused, listening. The door stood open. Mrs. Peyton, downstairs,\r\nwas sitting at the breakfast table, absently crumbling a bit of toast in\r\nher fingers, a faraway look in her eyes. Barry, at her bedroom door, was\r\nremarking the small mahogany desk, where, two nights ago, the “ghost” had\r\nwritten his warning to her.\r\n\r\nIn three swift strides he crossed to the desk, searched hurriedly among\r\nthe papers there and neatly pocketed one of these. Then he continued\r\nto his room. Mrs. Peyton still sat at the breakfast table in a pensive\r\nreverie, her wistful brown gaze lost in the morning sunshine beyond the\r\nleaded casements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later Barry alighted from a train in Chicago and forthwith called\r\non a colleague, whose skill in analyzing handwriting and identifying\r\nfinger prints had earned him the title of “expert.” He spent considerable\r\ntime with this man; and then he went to his office and wrote his report\r\nfor Mrs. Peyton.\r\n\r\nAnd when the report was finished he sat gazing at it musingly—somewhat as\r\nMrs. Peyton had gazed from her breakfast-room window this morning.\r\n\r\nWith an energetic shrug, as if to shake off his odd mood, he sealed the\r\nreport in an envelope, and put it in his pocket and started for an office\r\nbuilding in lower Michigan Avenue.\r\n\r\nPresently he entered a room in this building, luxuriously furnished and\r\nunoccupied, and abruptly halted. In the adjoining room he could hear\r\nthe voices of Scott Peyton and his wife; and since the door between the\r\ntwo offices stood partly open, he could also see their faces. Himself\r\nunobserved, Barry stood silently watching and listening.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’re right, Scott,” she said, standing beside her husband’s\r\ndesk and looking down at him. “After what happened last night, I’m just\r\nabout ready to do as you say—give the house up and move back to town. But\r\nI do so hate to leave that old place. I wish—”\r\n\r\n“Why should you?” he interrupted, scowling at his desk and avoiding her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peyton looked down, biting a corner of her lip and twisting the\r\nwedding ring of her finger.\r\n\r\n“It’s not so much what _I_ want,” she faltered, her voice tremulously\r\nlow, “but—the city is no place—not the _best_ place for our—_Oh, Scott!_”\r\nshe cried passionately, and flung out her hands to him in appeal. “Can’t\r\nyou _see_?”\r\n\r\nScott Peyton looked up and met his wife’s eyes; and the thing he saw in\r\ntheir liquid brown depths instantly chased the frown from his face and\r\ntook him to his feet in a swift rush of remorse and gladness.\r\n\r\nIn the next instant she was sobbing in his arms; and he was tenderly\r\npatting her shoulders and saying soothingly:\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, honey. We won’t give the place up. I don’t think—the\r\nghost—will bother us again....”\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Barry quietly departed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little later he again sat at his desk, gazing again at the report he\r\nhad written. And he now knew that this report would never be seen by any\r\neye save his.\r\n\r\nBut while he is sitting here suppose we look over his shoulder and glance\r\nat the thing before he tears it up:\r\n\r\n    “In Re Peyton ‘ghost’: ... Using a King Lear costume, which he\r\n    put on and off with lightning agility, the ‘ghost’ hoped, by\r\n    his nocturnal prowling, to frighten Mrs. Peyton into abandoning\r\n    the house as her husband desired.... Following his nightly\r\n    appearances, he quickly removed and concealed his costume, and\r\n    returned to his bed, careful to make no sound. He varied this\r\n    procedure, however, night before last, when he visited Mrs.\r\n    Peyton’s room. Had she left her key in the lock that night,\r\n    instead of hiding it under her pillow, he would have been\r\n    unable to call upon her. As it was, he readily unlocked the\r\n    door and entered. Leaving silently, he hid his costume, then\r\n    left the house and returned, making considerable noise.... The\r\n    finger prints he left in glue last night and those he left on\r\n    his napkin this morning, as well as his real and disguised\r\n    handwriting positively identify the ‘ghost’ as Mrs. Peyton’s\r\n    husband, Scott Peyton.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Have You Been Reading About King Tut?

R. G. S.,\r\nis too fresh in the public’s mind to warrant further reference, and were\r\nit not that I feel myself capable of throwing light upon the incidents\r\ncontributing to the sudden and apparently unnecessary snuffing out of a\r\nvaluable life, I should refrain from again alluding to it.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the physicians at the time decided that valvular\r\nweakness of the heart must have been responsible for the death of the\r\nnoted Egyptologist, but the statement of his own doctor that Sir Richard\r\nhad never theretofore exhibited indications of such weakness, and that he\r\nwas, to all appearances, in the best of health just prior to his death,\r\ncaused considerable wonder.\r\n\r\nI had thought to let the facts remain buried, but, for certain reasons, I\r\nshall reconsider my determination and tell what I know.\r\n\r\nI shall always remember the night on which Sir Richard summoned me, as\r\nhis counselor, to attend him at his apartments in the Albermarle. It\r\nwas a night of storm, and the London streets were a mass of slime and\r\nslush. A beastly wind had sprung up, and as I left my chambers at the\r\nTemple it almost took me off my feet. Therefore, it was with no little\r\nsatisfaction that I found a cheery log fire awaiting me in the library of\r\nmy distinguished client’s home, and the nip of brandy he provided was a\r\nlife saver.\r\n\r\nI noted, however, that for all his assumption of cheerfulness, something\r\nwas preying upon his mind, and I determined to get at the root of the\r\nmatter without delay:\r\n\r\n“How can I serve you, Sir Richard?” I asked, briskly. “I see there is\r\nsomething troubling you.”\r\n\r\n“Is it as apparent as that?” he asked, trying to appear unconcerned: but\r\nhis strong, homely features belied his effort at calmness.\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply, he went on:\r\n\r\n“But never mind that: I want you to write my will—now.”\r\n\r\n“Your will?” My expression of surprise and incredulity was natural,\r\nfor since I had been retained by him I had marked it as one of his few\r\nidiosyncrasies that he had never made his will. When I had mentioned\r\nto him the advisability of doing so, he had put it by with a whimsical\r\nremark about being superstitious.\r\n\r\n“I am in earnest,” he declared, “and it will be very simple—just a brief\r\nform, and I’ll sign it with my man as witness.”\r\n\r\n“But why the haste?” I said. “Why not wait till I can have the document\r\nproperly drawn up at my office tomorrow—”\r\n\r\n“No; now!” he said, and there was such finality in his tone I had no\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nMy concern for my client, whom I really liked and respected immensely,\r\nprompted me to ask:\r\n\r\n“You’re not ill, Sir Richard?”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, with the ghost of a smile on his rugged face.\r\n\r\n“Physically—no. But—”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and after a moment he again urged me to proceed with the\r\nmaking of the will.\r\n\r\nI drew up the document, which was a simple one, leaving the bulk of his\r\nlarge properties to his sister in Surrey, with numerous small bequests\r\nto friends and distant relatives, and a handsome sum and his private\r\ncollection to the British Museum and the Imperial Museum of Egyptology.\r\nWe had in his man, and the document was duly signed, after which he drew\r\na long breath of relief and, with a return of something like his natural\r\nmanner, passed me his cigar-case and leaned back in his chair, smoking\r\ncomfortably.\r\n\r\n“I’ve a story to tell you, Madden,” he said between puffs, “and it’s a\r\nqueer yarn, too. You’ll think—but never mind. Listen first, and say what\r\nyou like afterward. Only—” he glanced about him with an apprehensive\r\nexpression that fairly set my nerves atingle. “I hope we have time.”\r\n\r\n“Time for what?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe relaxed again and smiled:\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” he declared. “I’m a bit nervous, I guess, but it’s all\r\nright. Have another brandy.”\r\n\r\nWe drank solemnly together. Then he settled back once more and I prepared\r\nto listen.\r\n\r\n“Madden,” said he, “perhaps you’ll smile at what has seemed to me serious\r\nenough to warrant the steps I have just taken—making my will, I mean—but,\r\nhowever you look at it, I want you to know it’s true—every word of it.\r\n\r\n“My last trip to Egypt—from which I just returned a fortnight ago—was\r\nto have been my final one, anyway. I’ve made six trips out there in my\r\nlife, and I’ve collected enough information to fill a dozen volumes.\r\nAlso, I’ve contributed many fine specimens to the museum and corrected\r\nmany misapprehensions concerning the interpretation of some of the\r\nhieroglyphs. So, all in all, I think I’ve done pretty well.\r\n\r\n“This last visit was in many respects the most satisfactory, and indeed\r\nit witnessed a triumph in my career as an Egyptologist that would be a\r\ncrowning achievement, were it not for—but we won’t speak of that—yet.\r\n\r\n“I wonder, Madden, if you know anything about the ancient Egyptian\r\nreligious ceremonies and forms of worship? Anyway, I may tell you that\r\nthe Nile dwellers, as they were called, recognized as their supreme\r\ndeity, Osiris, lord of the underworld. By some he has been identified\r\nwith the Sun and, with the forty assessors of the dead, he was supposed\r\nto have judged the souls brought before him by Horus in the double halls\r\nof truth, after their good and evil deeds had been weighed by Anubis.\r\n\r\n“The Egyptians reverenced Osiris with as devout worship as the Chinese\r\ngive to Buddha, and the high priests of Osiris were regarded with almost\r\nas much awe as the deity himself.\r\n\r\n“In all our studies and investigations, however, we have never been able\r\nactually to identify Osiris, but it is now generally conceded that he was\r\nbelieved to have lived on earth at one time and that it was only after\r\nhis death that he assumed deific prerogatives. In this respect the modern\r\nChristian theology may be said to resemble the more ancient form to some\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n“Osiris was pictured on many of the tablets as a creature with the head\r\nof a bull, though there is some disagreement on this score. In any event,\r\nhis tomb was said to exist near Heliopolis, and it was to investigate\r\nthis tradition that I made my last trip to Egypt.”\r\n\r\nSir Richard paused to relight his cigar and listened to the storm which\r\nraged without. Again he gave that hasty, apprehensive glance about him,\r\nthen proceeded:\r\n\r\n“It would be impossible for me to explain to you, a layman, my\r\ninordinate joy at finding—by what means and after what tedious labor,\r\nI won’t stop to tell now—a deserted tomb which I knew, from certain\r\nhieroglyphic markings I found, was the very one of which I had been in\r\nsearch for the best part of half a year.\r\n\r\n“Understand that this whole tradition of the tomb of Osiris was regarded\r\nby my fellow scientists as a myth, and if it had been publicly known that\r\nI was giving it sufficient credence to spend a lot of time and money\r\nsearching for it I should have been looked upon as a madman and laughed\r\nout of the societies. This may enable you to appreciate more fully my\r\nsensations on actually locating at least the tomb. What I should find\r\nwithin, I hardly dared conjecture!\r\n\r\n“The tomb of a God! Can you imagine it, Madden?\r\n\r\n“And yet, if I had only stopped there! If only I had been content to\r\npause with the knowledge I already possessed, without proceeding further\r\nand desecrating with sacrilegious hands that lonely sarcophagus in the\r\ndesert!\r\n\r\n“How I succeeded in penetrating this tomb, of the horrors of bats and\r\ncrawling things that failed to stop me—of the almost supernatural awe\r\nthat came upon me—I can not pause to tell. It is enough to say that I\r\nstood at last beside the tremendous coffin of stone, trembling from an\r\nunknown dread. And, as I stood there, something white fluttered by me and\r\nup through the opening into the outer air. A sacred Ibis—but how it had\r\npenetrated there and how it had lived, I can not say.\r\n\r\n“Pour out another brandy, Madden—and throw that other log on the fire,\r\ntoo, if you don’t mind. My, how the wind blows! Did you speak?... Pardon\r\nme—I’m nervous tonight as I said before, very nervous.... Where was I?\r\nOh, yes—\r\n\r\n“That great sarcophagus stood before me, and on it I saw inscribed the\r\nsacred scarabæus and the feather of truth, while in the center was the\r\nword—the one, wonderful name—‘Heseri’—which is the Egyptian for Osiris!\r\n\r\n“Insatiable curiosity now took the place of the reverential awe that\r\nshould have possessed me, and with vandal hands I forced the stone lid\r\nfrom the casket. One glance I had of a great, bovine face, a _living_\r\nface, whose eyes looked into the depths of my soul—and then I fled as\r\nthough all the devils of Amenti were at my heels....\r\n\r\n“That is all Madden, except that I am nervous—fearfully so. It is so\r\nunlike me. You know how small a part fear has played in my life. I have\r\nfaced the dreaded simoon; I have been lost among savage tribes, I have\r\nconfronted death in a hundred forms—but _never_ have I felt as I do now.\r\nI tremble at a sound; my ears trick me into believing that I am always\r\nhearing some unusual noise; my appetite is failing, and I am feeling my\r\nage as I have never felt it until.... Good God! Madden! What was that\r\nsound?... Oh! _look behind you_, Madden! _Look!_...”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now I come to that portion of my statement that will probably be\r\nrefused credence by those who read; but, as I live, it is the truth.\r\n\r\nAs Sir Richard uttered his last words, he felt forward to his full length\r\nupon the hearth rug, even as I turned in obedience to his command. The\r\nshadows were heavy in the far corner of the spacious room, but I could\r\nsee a great, bulky something that swayed there, something that was a\r\npart, and yet, seemingly, was independent, of the shadows.\r\n\r\nI had a vision of two burning eyes and a black shining muzzle—a heavy,\r\nmisshapen head. A strange, animal-like, fetid odor was in my nostrils.\r\n\r\nI shrieked, and, turning, ran madly from the room, stumbled to the stairs\r\nand fled into the wind-swept night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure to Keep Tab on Quitting Time Kills Two\r\n\r\n\r\nTroy Hocker and Hugh Simpson, linemen for the Oklahoma Gas and Electric\r\nCompany, were repairing wires on top of a pole in Oklahoma one afternoon\r\nrecently. As they worked, they engaged in banter. It was nearly five\r\no’clock—their quitting time—but neither looked at his watch. The engineer\r\ndown at the power house saw it was ten minutes past five, time to turn\r\non the city’s arc lights. He pulled down the switch and sent 2,300\r\nvolts out to light the city. The men up on the pole ceased their banter.\r\nTheir bodies became stiff. Those on the ground laughed. This must be\r\nsome new prank of the boys. Then someone noticed smoke issuing from\r\nHocker’s shoes. Back at the power plant the amperage was fluctuating back\r\nand forth, and the engineer knew something was amiss. He threw off the\r\ncurrent—but the men were already dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A New Story by Julian Kilman, Master of Weird Fiction_\r\n\r\nTHE WELL\r\n\r\n\r\nJeremiah Hubbard toiled with a team of horses in a piece of ground some\r\ndistance down the road from his dwelling. When it neared five o’clock in\r\nthe autumn afternoon, he unwound the lines from his waist, unhooked the\r\ntraces and started home with his horses.\r\n\r\nHe was a heavy man, a bit under middle age, with a dish-shaped face and\r\nnarrow-set eyes. He walked with vigor. One of the horses lagged a trifle,\r\nand he struck it savagely with a short whip.\r\n\r\nThey came presently to the Eldridge dwelling, abandoned and tumbled down,\r\non the opposite side of the road. The farm was being worked on shares by\r\na man named Simpson, who lived five miles away and drove a “tin Lizzie.”\r\nAn ancient oak tree, the tremendous circumference of its trunk marred by\r\nsigns of decay, reared splendid gnarled branches skyward.\r\n\r\nThese branches shaded a disused well—a well that had been the first\r\none in Nicholas County, having been dug in the early fifties by the\r\npioneering Eldridge family. It went forty feet straight down into the\r\nresidual soil characteristic of the _locale_, but, owing to improved\r\ndrainage, it had become dry. Nothing remained of the old pump-house, save\r\nthe crumbling circle of stonework around the mouth, to give evidence of\r\nits one-time majesty.\r\n\r\nA child of eight ran from the rear of the premises. Hubbard frowned and\r\nstopped his team.\r\n\r\n“You better keep away from there,” he growled, “or you’ll fall into the\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced at him impishly.\r\n\r\n“You an’ Missus Hubbard don’t speak to each other, do you?”\r\n\r\nHubbard’s face went black. His whip sprang out and caught the girl about\r\nthe legs. She yelped and ran.\r\n\r\nAn eighth of a mile farther along the road Hubbard turned in and drove\r\nhis team to a big barn. He fed his stock. It was after six when he\r\nentered the house. This was a structure that, by comparison with the\r\ngigantic barn in the rear, seemed pigmy-like.\r\n\r\nA sallow, flat-chested woman, with a wisp of hair twisted into a knot,\r\ntook from Hubbard the two pails of milk he carried. She set them in the\r\nkitchen. The two exchanged no words.\r\n\r\nHubbard strode to the washstand, his boots thumping the floor, and\r\nperformed his ablutions. He rumpled his hair and beard, using much soap\r\nand water and blowing stertorously. In the dining-room a girl of twelve\r\nsat with a book. As her father came in she glanced at him timorously.\r\n\r\nHe gave no heed to her as he slumped down into a chair standing before\r\na desk. The desk was littered with papers, among which were typewritten\r\nsheets of the sort referred to as “pleadings”; there was a title-search\r\nmuch bethumbed and black along the edges, where the “set-outs” had been\r\nscanned with obvious care.\r\n\r\nThe man adjusted a pair of antiquated spectacles to his dish-face. To do\r\nthis he was compelled to pull the ends of the bows tight back over the\r\nears as his nose afforded practically no bridge to support the glasses.\r\n\r\nPresently he spoke to the girl:\r\n\r\n“Tell your mother to bring on the supper.”\r\n\r\nThe girl hastened out, and shortly thereafter the mother appeared\r\ncarrying dishes. Food was disposed about the table in silence. The farmer\r\nate gustily and in ten minutes finished his meal. Then he addressed his\r\ndaughter, keeping his eyes averted from his wife. “Tell your mother,” he\r\nsaid, “that I’ll want breakfast at five o’clock tomorrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“Where you goin’, Pa?” asked the girl.\r\n\r\n“I’m goin’ to drive to the county seat to see Lawyer Simmons.”\r\n\r\nHubbard’s gaze followed the girl as she helped clear the table.\r\n\r\n“Look-a here,” he said. “You been a-talkin’ to that Harper child?”\r\n\r\n“No,” returned the daughter, with a trace of spirit. “But I jest saw her\r\nfather over by the fence.”\r\n\r\n“What was he a-doin’ there?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t stay. I was afeard he’d catch me watchin’ him.”\r\n\r\nHubbard glowered and reached for his hat.\r\n\r\n“I’ll find out,” he snarled.\r\n\r\nWalking rapidly, he crossed a field of wheat stubble, keeping his\r\neyes fixed sharply ahead. It was dusk, but presently, at the northern\r\nextremity of his premises, he made out the figure of a man.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Harper!” he shouted. “You let that fence be.”\r\n\r\nHe ran forward swiftly.\r\n\r\nThe men were now separated by two wire-strand fences that paralleled\r\neach other only three feet apart. These fences, matching one another for\r\na distance of about two hundred yards—each farmer claiming title to the\r\nfence on the side farthest from his own—represented the basis of the\r\nlitigation over the boundary claim that had gone on between them for four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe odd spectacle of the twin fences had come to be one of the show\r\nplaces in the county. It had been photographed and shown in agricultural\r\njournals.\r\n\r\n“I don’t trust ye, Harper,” announced Hubbard, breathing hard. “You got\r\nthe inside track with Jedge Bissell, an’ the two of you are a-schemin’ to\r\nbeat me.”\r\n\r\nA laugh broke from the other.\r\n\r\n“I’ll beat you, all right,” he said coolly. “But it won’t be because\r\nJudge Bissell is unfair.”\r\n\r\nHis manner enraged Hubbard, who rushed swiftly at the first fence and\r\nthrew himself over. With equal celerity, he clambered over the second\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nStartled at the sudden outburst of temper, Harper had drawn back. He held\r\naloft a spade. Hubbard leaped at him. The spade descended.\r\n\r\nHarper was slightly-built, however, and the force of the blow did not\r\nhalt the infuriated man, now swinging at him with all his might. They\r\nclinched. Hubbard’s fingers caught at the throat of the smaller man, and\r\nthe two stumbled to the ground, Hubbard atop. The fall broke his grip.\r\nWith his huge fists he began to hammer the body. He continued until it\r\nwas limp.\r\n\r\nThen, his rage suddenly appeased, he drew back and stared at the inert\r\nfigure lying strangely quiet.\r\n\r\n“So!” he gasped.\r\n\r\nThere came the sound of someone singing, the voice floating distinctly\r\nthrough the night air. Hubbard recognized it for that of an itinerant\r\nFree Methodist minister, whose church in Ovid he and his family\r\noccasionally attended.\r\n\r\nThe song rolling forth, as the Man of God drove along the highway in his\r\nrig, was _Jesus, Lover of My Soul_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the moment Hubbard shielded his face with an arm as if to ward off an\r\ninvisible thing.\r\n\r\nThen, bending over the prostrate form, he ran his hand inside the\r\nclothing to test the action of the heart. He performed the act\r\nmechanically, because he knew he had killed his man.\r\n\r\nHe discovered the handbag. Evidently Harper was on his way to Ovid to\r\ncatch the train to the county seat for the trial on the morrow. This\r\nmeant that he would not be missed by his wife for at least twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe murderer studied his next move. Where to secrete the body? A piece of\r\nwood lay back of him, but he was aware that it was constantly combed by\r\nsquirrel hunters. He thought of the railroad. Why not an accident? Killed\r\nby the very train he was bound for?\r\n\r\nHe started to lug the body toward the track which passed half a mile to\r\nthe north. Realizing, however, that for the time at hand the distance was\r\ntoo great, he let the body slide to the ground. Next he stole along the\r\ntwin fences to the highway and peered both ways. No one seemed abroad.\r\n\r\nHe came back on the dead run, and in twenty minutes he had carried the\r\nbody to the Eldridge premises and flung it down the ancient well.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned he found his wife and daughter together in the parlor,\r\nwhere with the itinerant preacher, all three were kneeling on the floor\r\nin prayer. Hubbard unceremoniously nudged the clergymen.\r\n\r\n“That’ll do,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe minister rose, his tall, lanky figure towering over Hubbard.\r\n\r\n“Brother,” he began, in an orotund voice, “come with the Lord—”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I know,” returned Hubbard, with a patience that surprised his wife.\r\n“But I’ve got something to talk over with my family.” He paused. “Here,”\r\nhe added, feeling in his pocket and producing a small coin, “take this\r\nand go along.”\r\n\r\nWhen the preacher had left, Hubbard called to his daughter.\r\n\r\n“Harper was gone when I got over to the fence.”\r\n\r\n“What kept you so long?”\r\n\r\n“I walked over to the woods. There’s a nest of coons. They’re a-goin’ to\r\nplay havoc with the corn.” He smiled unnaturally. “Look-a here! If we\r\ncan catch ’em, I’ll give you the money their pelts bring.”\r\n\r\nHubbard divined that his acting was poor. Both the girl and his wife were\r\nfrankly regarding him.\r\n\r\n“Well!” he shouted. “What’s the matter with ye?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nuthin’, Pa, nuthin’,” whimpered the girl.\r\n\r\n“Then go to bed, the two of ye.”\r\n\r\nNext morning Hubbard started for the county seat, a ten mile drive. He\r\nreturned that evening and complained that the case had been adjourned\r\nbecause Harper had failed to appear in court.\r\n\r\nThe following day he went back to his field far down the road for more\r\nploughing. Twice he was called to the roadside by passersby to discuss\r\nthe disappearance of Harper.\r\n\r\nOne morning a week later, when he came along the road with his team, he\r\ndiscovered the Harper child on the Eldridge premises. She was sitting at\r\nthe edge of the well.\r\n\r\nWith a suppressed oath, he dropped the lines and half-walked, half-ran,\r\nto where the little girl sat.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I tell you to stay away from there!” he exploded.\r\n\r\nThe girl stared at him, but made no move, though her lips quivered.\r\nHubbard glanced back to observe the road. Then he caught her arm.\r\n\r\n“Go home!” he shouted.\r\n\r\nHe spun her roughly. She continued to stare at him as she retreated\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\nAll that morning Hubbard worked his horses hard. He realized that he was\r\neager to go back by the Eldridge dwelling. Promptly at twelve o’clock,\r\ntherefore, he tied his team and started up the road. A flash of relief\r\ncame to him when he did not observe the little girl. It left him cold,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n“Eatin’ dinner,” he mumbled.\r\n\r\nHe moved off, without looking into the well. Until four o’clock that\r\nafternoon he labored. On his way home he discovered the girl again seated\r\nby the well. She was bending over and acting queerly.\r\n\r\nHurrying his horses to the roadside, he looped the lines over one of the\r\nposts in the old “snake” fence. As he approached, he saw her toss a piece\r\nof stone down the hole.\r\n\r\nHubbard waited until he was sure of his voice.\r\n\r\n“Come with me,” he said.\r\n\r\nGripping the girl he started with her toward her home but a short\r\ndistance away. When they arrived the front door was ajar. A woman, with\r\neyes red from weeping, looked at Hubbard in silence.\r\n\r\n“Here!” he said gruffly. “This child ought to be kept to home. She’ll\r\nfall into the well.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Harper merely reached out her arms for her daughter. Hubbard\r\nremained standing awkwardly.\r\n\r\n“Have you heard anything of Harper yet?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to talk to you,” replied the woman.\r\n\r\nHubbard turned on his heel. Waiting for him by his horses, was the deputy\r\nsheriff. The two further discussed the disappearance.\r\n\r\n“If you yourself wasn’t so well known, Jeremiah,” finally declared the\r\nofficial, “they’d sure be thinkin’ you was in it some way.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” grunted the farmer, as he untied the lines.\r\n\r\n“Well, everybody knows you an’ Harper been lawin’ it for years over that\r\nboundary line.”\r\n\r\nHubbard achieved a laugh.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell ye where Harper is. He’s cleared out, that’s what I\r\nthink—deserted his family.”\r\n\r\nThat night, and many following nights, Hubbard did not sleep. Some weeks\r\nlater a tremendous electric storm broke in the night. One particularly\r\nheavy clap so startled the wakeful Hubbard that he leaped from his bed\r\nand dressed. In the pouring rain he started out.\r\n\r\nInevitably his steps took him toward the well. It was black, and he could\r\nnot see at first. But another flash came, and he observed a strange thing:\r\n\r\nThe huge oak, standing at the side of the well, had been split in two by\r\nlightning, and one portion of the tree had fallen over the mouth of the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning Simpson, the man with the “tin Lizzie,” stopped at Hubbard’s\r\nplace. He was a blunt-spoken, red-faced man whom Hubbard hated.\r\n\r\n“That was a bad storm last night,” he said. “The lightning struck the big\r\noak tree by the well.”\r\n\r\n“What of it?” snapped Hubbard.\r\n\r\n“There was a skeleton in the center of that tree,” explained Simpson. “I\r\nwas talking this morning with the sheriff over the telephone. He said\r\nseventy-five years ago a man was murdered in Ovid, and they never found\r\nhis body. This skeleton must be his.”\r\n\r\nHubbard cleared his throat sharply.\r\n\r\n“What did you do with it?”\r\n\r\n“The skull and one of the leg bones fell down into the well when I tried\r\nto gather them up. I want to borrow some rope so I can get down in there.”\r\n\r\nFor a bare second Hubbard was silent.\r\n\r\n“What you ought to do,” he said, gathering himself, “is to fill up that\r\nhole. It’s dangerous.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. That’s so. But I’m goin’ to get that skull first. It’ll be a good\r\nexhibit. I’m wonderin’ whether we’ll ever find Harper’s skeleton.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment,” said Hubbard huskily, starting for the barn. “I’ll get\r\nsome rope and help you.”\r\n\r\nThe two returned to the Eldridge farm. They found there the dead man’s\r\nchild. She had perched herself on the fallen tree.\r\n\r\n“Damn fool!” muttered Hubbard. “Her mother lettin’ her play around here!”\r\n\r\nA pulley was rigged over the branch and the rope inserted with a board\r\nfor a rest.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go down,” vouchsafed Hubbard.\r\n\r\nSimpson looked his surprise as he assented.\r\n\r\nIt took Hubbard five minutes or so to retrieve the missing skeleton\r\nparts. He brought them up, the leg bone and the grinning skull. He was\r\npale when he hauled himself over the edge.\r\n\r\n“I’m a-goin’ to fill up that hole myself,” he said.\r\n\r\n“All right,” retorted Simpson, handling the skull curiously. “Go to it.”\r\n\r\nWord traveled of the finding of the ancient skeleton, and the inhabitants\r\nbegan driving thither to see the sight. Simpson, a man of some ingenuity,\r\nhad wired the bleached white bones together and suspended them from one\r\nof the branches of the fallen tree. The skeleton dangled and swung in the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nHubbard, maddened by the delay and publicity, felt himself wearing away.\r\nHe had become obsessed with conviction that if the hole were filled his\r\nmind would be at rest.\r\n\r\nThe nights of continued sleeplessness were ragging his nerves, and he was\r\nby this time unable to remain in bed. He would throw himself down, fully\r\ndressed, waiting until the others were asleep. Then he would steal out.\r\n\r\nAt first he had merely walked the roads, swinging his arms and mumbling.\r\nBut as the night progressed his stride would quicken, and frequently he\r\nwould take to running. He would run until his lungs were bursting and\r\na slaver fed from his mouth. Late travelers began to catch glimpses of\r\nthe fleeting figure, and the rumor grew that a ghost was haunting the\r\nlocality of the well—that the skeleton walked.\r\n\r\nHubbard grew haggard. But he found himself unable to discontinue his\r\nnocturnal prowls, some of which took him miles, but all of which\r\ninvariably wound up at one place—the well.\r\n\r\nHere, fagged and exhausted, he would sit until the approach of dawn,\r\nstaring at the swinging skeleton, mouthing incoherencies, praying,\r\nsinging hymns beneath his breath, laughing. At the approach of dawn he\r\nwould steal home.\r\n\r\nAt last, after interest in the skeleton had subsided and Simpson had\r\nconsented to its removal, Hubbard loaded his wagon with stones and small\r\nboulders and started for the well. That first forenoon he made three\r\ntrips, dumping each time a considerable quantity of stones.\r\n\r\nNext morning he worked in an additional trip. He began to experience\r\nsurcease. But on the afternoon of the second day, when he made another\r\ntrip, Simpson came over from his work in an adjoining field.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to see you yesterday,” he said, quizzically regarding Hubbard.\r\n“Mrs. Harper was here. She said her little girl was playin’ around here\r\nand dropped a pair of andirons down the well.”\r\n\r\n“What of it?” Hubbard jerked out.\r\n\r\n“You got to get ’em out.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because them andirons is relics.”\r\n\r\n“But you gave me permission to fill the hole.”\r\n\r\n“I was kiddin’ you,” laughed Simpson. “I’m only rentin’ the farm. I ain’t\r\ngot nothin’ to do with the house and yard.”\r\n\r\nWithout a word Hubbard turned to his wagon. He got onto the seat and\r\ndrove off. In an hour he came back with the same rope that had been used\r\nto recover the missing portions of the skeleton. Also, he brought with\r\nhim a farm laborer who did occasional work for him.\r\n\r\nSimpson regarded Hubbard amusedly as the latter adjusted once more the\r\npulley, arranged a bucket and then hitched his team to the end of the\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nPatiently, bucketful by bucketful, the stones were elevated and dumped.\r\nDown below in the black interior, Hubbard labored for an hour. At six\r\no’clock he had not found the andirons. Twice he had been compelled to\r\ncome up for fresh air.\r\n\r\nHis last trip up left him so white-faced and weak that he was forced to\r\ngo home.\r\n\r\nThat night he resorted to sleeping powders. But he lay and tossed,\r\nwide-eyed, through the dark hours. Sometime after midnight he got up.\r\nA light was still burning in his wife’s room, and, tiptoeing down the\r\nhall, he paused at her door. In low voices the mother and daughter were\r\nconversing. To his heated imagination it seemed certain they were talking\r\nof Harper’s disappearance.\r\n\r\nMumbling to himself he left the house. He ran down the lane to the\r\nhighway and along this until he came to the Eldridge place. He determined\r\nnot to stop, and succeeded in running by, like a frightened animal.\r\n\r\nHis gait accelerated. It was one best described as scurrying, as he ran\r\ncrouched and low. He thought he saw some one approaching. This turned\r\nhim. Back he fled with the speed of the wind.\r\n\r\nDrawn by an irresistible force, he made straight for the Eldridge\r\npathway. He came to the well, the entrance of which gaped at him. For a\r\nmoment he stood, with eyes wide open, staring into the black depths.\r\n\r\nThen, screaming, he plunged in head-first.\r\n\r\nHis cry, long-drawn and eerie, hung quivering on the night air.\r\n\r\nIn the Hubbard home, a quarter of a mile away, the mother and daughter\r\nheard it. The two listened with palpitating hearts. They caught one\r\nanother’s hands.\r\n\r\nIn a hoarse whisper the mother exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“_What’s that?_”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Otis Adelbert Kline, Author of “The Thing of a Thousand Shapes,” Spins\r\nAnother “Spooky” Yarn for the Readers of WEIRD TALES_\r\n\r\nThe Phantom Wolfhound\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Dorp reluctantly laid aside the manuscript on which he had been\r\nworking, capped and pocketed his fountain pen, and rose to meet his\r\ncallers.\r\n\r\nHe was visibly annoyed by this, the third interruption of the afternoon,\r\nbut his look of irritation changed to a welcoming smile when he saw the\r\nbulky form that was framed in the doorway. He recognized Harry Hoyne of\r\nthe Hoyne Detective Agency, a heavy-set, florid-faced man whose iron gray\r\nhair and moustache proclaimed him well past middle age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe slender, stoop-shouldered individual who accompanied him was a total\r\nstranger. He had pale, hawklike features, small snaky eyes that glittered\r\noddly from cavernous sockets, and long, bony fingers that suggested the\r\nclaws of a bird.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Doc,” boomed the detective genially, crushing the hand of his\r\nhost in his great, muscular paw. “Meet Mr. Ritsky.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was conscious of a cold, clammy sensation as he took the\r\nhand of the stranger and acknowledged the introduction. Was it the\r\ncontrast between those chill fingers and the strong warm ones of the\r\ndetective that had caused this feeling? He did not know; but somehow,\r\ninstinctively, he disliked Mr. Ritsky.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a queer case for you, Doc,” said Hoyne, taking a proffered\r\ncigar and inserting it far back in his cheek, unlighted. “Just your\r\nspecialty—ghosts and all that. I told Mr. Ritsky you’d be the only man\r\nto unravel the mystery for him. Was over to his house last night and the\r\nthing got me—too unsubstantial—too damned elusively unreal. And yet I’ll\r\nswear there was something there. I heard it; but it got away and didn’t\r\nleave a trace. When it comes to finger prints and things like that you\r\nknow I ain’t exactly a dumb-bell, but I gotta admit this thing, whatever\r\nit is, had me hopelessly horn-swoggled.”\r\n\r\nRitsky declined a cigar, saying he didn’t dare smoke because of heart\r\ntrouble. The doctor selected one with care, lighted it slowly, puffed it\r\nwith a relish, and settled back with a look of eager anticipation in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“What happened last night?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Maybe we better begin at the beginning,” said Hoyne. “You see, there’s\r\nquite a story goes along with this case, and Mr. Ritsky can tell it\r\nbetter than I. Don’t be afraid to give him all the dope, Mr. Ritsky. The\r\ndoctor knows all about such things—wrote a book about ’em, in fact. Let’s\r\nsee. What was the name of that book, Doc?”\r\n\r\n“‘Investigations of Materialization Phenomena.’”\r\n\r\n“Righto! I never can remember it. Anyhow, Mr. Ritsky, tell him your story\r\nand ask him all the questions you want to. He’s headquarters on this\r\nstuff.”\r\n\r\nRitsky studied his clawlike hands for a moment, clasping and unclasping\r\nthe bony fingers. Suddenly he looked up.\r\n\r\n“Do animals have immortal souls?” he asked, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you have sadly overrated my ability as a recorder of\r\nscientific facts,” replied the doctor, smiling slightly. “Frankly, I do\r\nnot know. I don’t believe anyone knows. Most people think they haven’t,\r\nand I incline toward that belief.”\r\n\r\n“Then such a thing as a ghost of a—a hound could not be?”\r\n\r\n“I would not say that. Nothing is impossible. There are undoubtedly more\r\nthings in heaven and earth, as Shakespeare said, than we have dreamed of\r\nin our philosophy. However, I would consider a materialization of the\r\ndisembodied spirit of a canine, or any of the other lower animals, as\r\nhighly improbable.”\r\n\r\n“But if you saw one with your own eyes—”\r\n\r\n“I should probably be inclined to doubt the evidence of my senses. Have\r\n_you_ seen one?”\r\n\r\n“Have I _seen_ one?” groaned Ritsky. “Good Lord, man, I’d give every cent\r\nI own to be rid of that thing! For two years it’s turned my nights into\r\nhell! From a perfectly healthy, normal human being I’ve been reduced to a\r\nphysical wreck. Sometimes I think my reason is slipping. The thing will\r\neither kill me or drive me mad if it is not stopped.”\r\n\r\nHe buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n“This is most strange,” said the doctor. “You say the apparition first\r\ntroubled you two years ago?”\r\n\r\n“Not in its present form. But it was there, nevertheless. The first\r\ntime I saw it was shortly after I killed that cursed dog. A month, to\r\nbe exact. I shot him on the twenty-first of August, and he, or it, or\r\n_something_, came back to haunt me on the twenty-first of September.\r\n\r\n“How vividly I remember the impressions of that first night of terror!\r\nHow I tried, the next day, to make myself believe it was only a\r\ndream—that such a thing could not be. I had retired at eleven o’clock,\r\nand was awakened from a sound sleep some time between one and two in the\r\nmorning by the whining, yapping cry of a dog. As there were no dogs on\r\nthe premises, you can imagine my surprise.\r\n\r\n“I was about to get up when something directly over the foot of my bed\r\nriveted my attention. In the dim light it appeared a grayish white in\r\ncolor, and closely resembled the head and pendant ears of a hound. I\r\nnoticed, with horror, that it was moving slowly toward me, and I was\r\ntemporarily paralyzed with fright when it emitted a low, cavernous growl.\r\n\r\n“Driving my muscles by a supreme effort of will, I leaped from the bed\r\nand switched on the light. In the air where I had seen the thing hanging\r\nthere was nothing. The door was bolted and the windows were screened.\r\nThere was nothing unusual in the room, as I found after a thorough\r\nsearch. Mystified, I hunted through the entire house from top to bottom,\r\nbut without finding a trace of the thing, whatever if was, that had made\r\nthe sounds.\r\n\r\n“From that day to this I have never laid my head on a pillow with a\r\nfeeling of security. At first it visited me at intervals of about a week.\r\nThese intervals were gradually shortened until it came every night. As\r\nits visits became more frequent the apparition seemed to grow. First it\r\nsprouted a small body like that of a terrier, all out of proportion to\r\nthe huge head. Each night that body grew a little larger until it assumed\r\nthe full proportions of a Russian wolfhound. Recently it has attempted to\r\nattack me, but I have always frustrated it by switching on the light.”\r\n\r\n“Are you positive that you have not been dreaming all this?” asked the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n“Would it be possible for some one else to hear a dream of mine?”\r\ncountered Ritsky. “We have only been able to retain one servant on\r\naccount of those noises. All, with the exception of our housekeeper, who\r\nis quite deaf, heard the noises and left us as a result.”\r\n\r\n“Who are the members of your household?”\r\n\r\n“Other than the housekeeper and myself, there is only my niece and ward,\r\na girl of twelve.”\r\n\r\n“Has she heard the noises?”\r\n\r\n“She has never mentioned them.”\r\n\r\n“Why not move to another apartment?”\r\n\r\n“That would do no good. We have moved five times in the last two years.\r\nWhen the thing first started we were living on the estate of my niece\r\nnear Lake Forest. We left the place in charge of care-takers and moved to\r\nEvanston. The apparition followed us. We moved to Englewood. The thing\r\nmoved with us. We have had three different apartments in Chicago since.\r\nIt came to all of them with equal regularity.”\r\n\r\n“Would you mind writing for me the various addresses at which you have\r\nlived?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, if they will assist in solving this mystery.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor procured a pencil and a sheet of note paper, and Ritsky put\r\ndown the addresses.\r\n\r\nDoctor Dorp scanned them carefully.\r\n\r\n“Villa Rogers,” he said. “Then your niece is Olga Rogers, daughter of\r\nmillionaire James Rogers and his beautiful wife, the former Russian\r\ndancer, both of whom were lost with the _Titanic_?”\r\n\r\n“Olga’s mother was my sister. After the sudden death of her parents, the\r\ncourt appointed me her guardian and trustee of the estate.”\r\n\r\n“I believe that is all the information we need for the present, Mr.\r\nRitsky. If you have no objection I will call on you after dinner this\r\nevening, and if Mr. Hoyne cares to accompany me we will see what we can\r\ndo toward solving this mystery. Please take care that no one in your home\r\nis apprised of the object of our visit. Say, if you wish, that we are\r\ngoing to install some electrical equipment.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be there with bells,” said Hoyne as they rose to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II._\r\n\r\nShortly after his guests’ departure, Doctor Dorp was speeding out\r\nSheridan Road toward Villa Rogers.\r\n\r\nThe drive took nearly an hour, and he spent another half-hour in\r\nquestioning the care-takers, man and wife. He returned home with a\r\nwell-filled notebook, and on his arrival he began immediately assembling\r\nparaphernalia for the evening’s work. This consisted of three cameras\r\nwith specially constructed shutters, several small electrical mechanisms,\r\na coil of insulated wire, a flash-gun, and a kit of tools.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he picked up Hoyne at his home, and they started for the\r\n“haunted house.”\r\n\r\n“You say you investigated this case last night, Hoyne?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“I tried to, but there was nothing to it, so far as I could see, except\r\nthe whining of that dog.”\r\n\r\n“Where were you when you heard the noises?”\r\n\r\n“Ritsky had retired. I slept in a chair in his room. About two o’clock I\r\nwas awakened by a whining noise, not loud, yet distinctly audible. Then\r\nI heard a yell from Ritsky. He switched on the light a moment later,\r\nthen sat down on the bed, trembling from head to foot, while beads of\r\nperspiration stood out on his forehead.\r\n\r\n“‘Did you see it?’ he asked me.\r\n\r\n“‘See what?’ I said.\r\n\r\n“‘The hound.’\r\n\r\n“I told him I hadn’t seen a thing, but I heard the noise all right.\r\nBetween you and me, though, I did think I saw a white flash for a second\r\nbeside his bed, but I can’t swear to it.”\r\n\r\n“We won’t trust our eyes tonight,” said the doctor. “I have three\r\neyes in that case that will not be affected by hysteria or register\r\nhallucinations.”\r\n\r\n“Three eyes? What are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“Cameras, of course.”\r\n\r\n“But how—”\r\n\r\n“Wait until we get there. I’ll show you.”\r\n\r\nA few moments later they were admitted to the apartment by the\r\nhousekeeper, a stolid woman of sixty or thereabout. Ritsky presented them\r\nto his niece, a dreamy-eyed, delicately pretty school girl with silky\r\ngolden curls that glistened against the pale whiteness of her skin.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind,” said the doctor, “we will look things over now.\r\nIt will take some time to install the wiring and make other necessary\r\npreparations.”\r\n\r\nRitsky showed them through the apartment, which was roomy, furnished in\r\ngood taste and artistically decorated. The floor plan was quite simple\r\nand ordinary. First came the large living-room that extended across the\r\nfront of the house. This opened at the right into the dining-room and at\r\nthe center into a hallway which led through to the back of the building.\r\nBehind the dining-room was the kitchen, and behind that the servant’s\r\nroom. Ritsky’s bedroom was directly across the hall from the dining-room.\r\nThen came his niece’s bedroom, a spare bedroom and a bathroom. Each of\r\nthe three front bedrooms was equipped with a private bath and large\r\nclothes-closet.\r\n\r\nThe doctor began by installing the three cameras in Ritsky’s room,\r\nfastening them on the wall in such a manner that they faced the bed from\r\nthree directions. After focusing them properly, he set the flash-gun on a\r\ncollapsible tripod and pointed it toward the bed.\r\n\r\nThe room was lighted by an alabaster bowl that depended from the ceiling\r\nand could be turned on or off by a switch at the bedside. There were, in\r\naddition, two wall lights, one on each side of the dresser, and a small\r\nreading lamp on a table in one corner. These last three lights were\r\noperated by individual pull-cords.\r\n\r\nRitsky procured a step-ladder for him, and, after switching off the\r\ndrop light, he removed one of the bulbs from the cluster and inserted a\r\nfour-way socket. From this socket he ran wires along the ceiling and\r\ndown the wall to the three cameras and the flash-gun. By the time these\r\npreparations were completed Miss Rogers and the housekeeper had retired.\r\n\r\nHoyne surveyed the finished job with frank admiration.\r\n\r\n“If there’s anything in this room when Ritsky turns the switch those\r\nthree mechanical eyes will sure spot it,” he said enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Ritsky,” began the doctor, “I want you to place yourself\r\nentirely in our hands for the night. Keep cool, fear nothing, and carry\r\nout my instructions to the letter. I suggest that you go to bed now and\r\nendeavor to get some sleep. If the apparition troubles you, do just as\r\nyou have done in the past—turn on the light. Do not, however, touch\r\nthe light switch unless the thing appears. The photographic plates,\r\nwhen developed, will tell whether you have been suffering from a mere\r\nhallucination induced by auto-suggestion or if genuine materialization\r\nphenomena have occurred.”\r\n\r\nAfter closing and bolting the windows they placed the step-ladder in the\r\nhallway beside Ritsky’s door. Then they obtained a duplicate key from him\r\nand asked him to lock himself in, removing his key so they might gain\r\nentrance at any time.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was ready they quietly brought two chairs into the hall\r\nfrom the spare bedroom and began their silent vigil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III._\r\n\r\nBoth men sat in silence for nearly three hours. The doctor seemed lost in\r\nthought, and Hoyne nervously masticated his inevitable unlighted cigar.\r\nThe house was quiet, except for the ticking of the hall clock and its\r\nhourly chiming announcements of the flight of time.\r\n\r\nShortly after the clock struck two they heard a low, scarcely audible\r\nmoan.\r\n\r\n“What was that?” whispered the detective, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” the doctor replied.\r\n\r\nPresently it was repeated, followed by prolonged sobbing.\r\n\r\n“It’s Miss Rogers,” said Hoyne, excitedly.\r\n\r\nDoctor Dorp rose and softly tiptoed to the door of the child’s bed\r\nchamber. After listening there for a moment he noiselessly opened the\r\ndoor and entered. Presently he returned, leaving the door ajar. The\r\nsobbing and moaning continued.\r\n\r\n“Just as I expected,” he said. “I want you to go in the child’s room,\r\nkeep quiet, and make a mental note of everything you see and hear. Stay\r\nthere until I call you, and be prepared for a startling sight.”\r\n\r\n“Wh—what is it?” asked Hoyne, nervously.\r\n\r\n“Nothing that will hurt you. What’s the matter? Are you afraid?”\r\n\r\n“Afraid, hell!” growled Hoyne. “Can’t a man ask you a question—”\r\n\r\n“No time to answer questions now. Get in there and do as I say if you\r\nwant to be of any assistance.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Doc. It’s your party.”\r\n\r\nThe big detective entered the room of the sobbing child and squeezed his\r\ngreat bulk into a dainty rocking chair from which he could view her bed.\r\nShe tossed from side to side, moaning as if in pain, and Hoyne, pitying\r\nher, wondered why the doctor did not awaken her.\r\n\r\nPresently she ceased her convulsive movements, clenched her hands, and\r\nuttered a low, gurgling cry, as a white, filmy mass slowly emerged\r\nfrom between her lips. The amazed detective stared with open mouth, so\r\nfrightened that he forgot to chew his cigar. The filmy material continued\r\nto pour forth for several minutes that seemed like hours to the tense\r\nwatcher. Then it formed a nebulous, wispy cloud above the bed, completely\r\ndetached itself from the girl, and floated out through the half-opened\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nDoctor Dorp, standing in the hallway, saw a white, misty thing of\r\nindefinite outline emerge from the bedroom. It floated through the\r\nhall and paused directly in front of Ritsky’s door. He approached it\r\ncautiously and noiselessly, and noticed that it grew rapidly smaller.\r\nThen he discovered the reason. It was flowing _through the keyhole_!\r\n\r\nIn a short time it had totally disappeared. He waited breathlessly.\r\n\r\n_What was that?_ The whining cry of a hound broke the stillness! He\r\nmounted the step-ladder in order to view the interior of the room through\r\nthe glass transom. He had scarcely placed his foot on the second step\r\nwhen the whining noise changed to a gurgling growl that was followed by a\r\nshriek of mortal terror and the dull report of the flash-gun.\r\n\r\nLeaping down from the ladder, the doctor called Hoyne, and they entered\r\nthe “haunted” bed chamber. The room was brilliantly lighted by the\r\nalabaster bowl and filled with the sickening fumes of flash-powder.\r\n\r\nHoyne opened the windows and returned to where the doctor was\r\nthoughtfully viewing Ritsky, who had apparently fainted. He had fallen\r\nhalf out of bed, and hung there with one bony arm trailing and his\r\nemaciated face a picture of abject fear.\r\n\r\n“My God!” exclaimed Hoyne. “Look there on his throat and chest. _The\r\nfrothy slaver of a hound!_”\r\n\r\nThe doctor took a small porcelain dish from his pocket, removed the lid,\r\nand with the blade of his pocket knife, scraped part of the slimy deposit\r\ninto the receptacle.\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t we better try to bring him to?” inquired Hoyne.\r\n\r\nAfter they had lifted him back in bed the doctor leaned over and held his\r\near to the breast of the recumbent man. He took his stethoscope from his\r\ncase and listened again. Then he straightened gravely.\r\n\r\n“No earthly power can bring him to,” he said, softly, “_Ritsky is dead!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV._\r\n\r\nThe detective remained in the house, pending the arrival of the coroner\r\nand undertaker, while Doctor Dorp hurried home with his paraphernalia and\r\nthe sample of slime he had scraped from the corpse. Hoyne was puzzled by\r\nthe fact that the doctor searched the house and the clothing of the dead\r\nman before departing.\r\n\r\nThe detective was kept busy at the Ritsky apartment until nearly ten\r\no’clock. After stopping at a restaurant for a bit of breakfast and a cup\r\nof coffee, he went directly to the doctor’s home.\r\n\r\nHe found the psychologist in his laboratory, engrossed in a complicated\r\nchemical experiment. He shook a test tube, which he had been heating over\r\na small alcohol lamp, held it up to the light, stood it in a small rack\r\nin which were a number of others partly filled with liquid, and nodded\r\ncordially to his friend.\r\n\r\n“Morning, Doc.,” greeted Hoyne. “Have you doped out what we are going to\r\ntell the coroner yet?”\r\n\r\n“I knew the direct cause of Ritsky’s death long ago. It was fear. The\r\nindirect cause, the thing that induced the fear, required careful\r\nexamination and considerable chemical research.”\r\n\r\n“And it was—”\r\n\r\n“Psychoplasm.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t get you, Doc. What is psychoplasm?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt you have heard of the substance called ectoplasm, regarding\r\nwhich Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has delivered numerous lectures, or an\r\nidentical substance called teleplasm, discovered by Baron Von Schrenck\r\nNotzing while attending materialization seances with the medium known as\r\nEva.\r\n\r\n“While the baron was observing and photographing this substance in\r\nEurope, my friend and colleague, Professor James Braddock, was conducting\r\nsimilar investigations in this country. He named the substance\r\npsychoplasm, and I like the name better than either of the other two, as\r\nit is undoubtedly created or generated from invisible particles of matter\r\nthrough the power of the subjective mind.\r\n\r\n“I have examined and analyzed many samples of this substance in the past.\r\nThe plate I now have under the compound microscope, and the different\r\nchemical determinations I have just completed, show conclusively that\r\nthis is psychoplasm.”\r\n\r\n“But how—where did it come from?”\r\n\r\n“I learned something of the history of Ritsky and his ward yesterday. Let\r\nme enlighten you on that score first:\r\n\r\n“The man told the truth when he said he was appointed guardian of\r\nhis niece, and also when he said that he had shot a dog. The dog, in\r\nquestion, was a Russian wolfhound, a present sent to the girl by her\r\nparents while they were touring Russia. He was only half grown when he\r\narrived, and the two soon became boon companions, frolicking and playing\r\nabout the grounds together or romping through the big house.\r\n\r\n“Some time after the death of Olga’s parents, Ritsky, then editor of a\r\nradical newspaper in New York, took up his abode at Villa Rogers. The\r\ndog, by that time full grown, took a violent dislike to him and, on one\r\noccasion, bit him quite severely. When he announced his intention of\r\nhaving the animal shot the girl wept violently and swore that she would\r\nkill herself if Shag, as she had named him, were killed. It seemed that\r\nshe regarded him as a token of the love of her parents who had sailed\r\naway, never to return.”\r\n\r\n“_Shag!_ That’s the name!” broke in Hoyne, excitedly. “After that white\r\nthing floated out of the room she made noises like a dog and then\r\nanswered them, saying ‘Good old Shag,’ and patting an imaginary head. She\r\nsure gave me the creeps, though, when she let out that growl.”\r\n\r\n“The vengeful Ritsky,” continued the doctor, “was determined that Shag\r\nshould die, and found an opportunity to shoot him with a pistol when\r\nthe girl was in the house. Shortly after, the faithful creature dragged\r\nhimself to the feet of his mistress and died in her arms. He could not\r\ntell her who had taken his life, but she must have known subjectively,\r\nand as a result entertained a hatred for her uncle of which she\r\nobjectively knew nothing.\r\n\r\n“Most people have potential mediumistic power. How this power is\r\ndeveloped in certain individuals and remains practically dormant in\r\nothers is a question that has never been satisfactorily explained.\r\nI personally believe that it is often developed because of intense\r\nemotional repressions which, unable to find an outlet in a normal\r\nmanner through the objective mind, find expression in abnormal psychic\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\n“This seemed to be the case with Olga Rogers. She developed the power\r\nsubjectively without objective knowledge that it existed. One of the\r\nmost striking of psychic powers is that of creating or assembling the\r\nsubstance called psychoplasm, causing it to assume various forms, and to\r\nmove as if endowed with a mind of its own.\r\n\r\n“Olga developed this peculiar power to a remarkable degree. Acting under\r\nthe direction of her subjective intelligence, the substance assumed the\r\nform of her beloved animal companion and sought revenge on its slayer. We\r\narrived a day too late to save the object of her unconscious hatred.”\r\n\r\n“Too bad you were not there the night before,” said Hoyne. “The poor\r\ndevil would be alive today if you had been on hand with me the first\r\nnight to dope the thing out.”\r\n\r\n“We might have saved him for a prison term or the gallows,” replied the\r\ndoctor, a bit sardonically. “You haven’t seen this, of course.”\r\n\r\nHe took a small silver pencil from the table and handed it to the\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\n“What’s that got to do with—”\r\n\r\n“Open it! Unscrew the top. Careful!”\r\n\r\nHoyne unscrewed it gingerly and saw that the chamber, which was made to\r\nhold extra leads, was filled with a white powder.\r\n\r\n“Arsenic,” said the doctor, briefly. “Did you notice the sickly pallor of\r\nthat girl—the dark rings under her eyes? Her loving uncle and guardian\r\nwas slowly poisoning her, increasing the doses from time to time. In\r\nanother month or six weeks she would have been dead, and Ritsky, her\r\nnearest living relative, would have inherited her immense fortune.”\r\n\r\n“Well I’ll be damned!” exploded Hoyne.\r\n\r\nDoctor Dorp’s laboratory assistant entered and handed a package of prints\r\nto his employer.\r\n\r\n“Here are the proofs of last night’s photographs,” said the doctor. “Care\r\nto see them?”\r\n\r\nHoyne took them to the window and scrutinized them carefully.\r\n\r\nAll showed Ritsky leaning out of bed, his hand on the light switch, his\r\nface contorted in an expression of intense horror—_and, gripping his\r\nthroat in its ugly jaws, was the white, misshapen phantasm of a huge\r\nRussian wolfhound_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTERPIECES OF WEIRD FICTION\r\n\r\n_No. 2—The Murders in the Rue Morgue_\r\n\r\n_By_ EDGAR ALLAN POE\r\n\r\n    What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when\r\n    he hid himself among women, although puzzling questions are not\r\n    beyond _all_ conjecture.—SIR THOMAS BROWNE, _Urn-Burial_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves,\r\nbut little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their\r\neffects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to\r\ntheir possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest\r\nenjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting\r\nin such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst\r\nin that moral activity which _disentangles_. He derives pleasure from\r\neven the most trivial occupations bringing his talents into play. He\r\nis fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his\r\nsolutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary\r\napprehension preternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul\r\nand essence of method have, in truth, the whole air of intuition. The\r\nfaculty of resolution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study,\r\nand especially by the highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely\r\non account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if _par\r\nexcellence_, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyze. A\r\nchess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It\r\nfollows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character,\r\nis greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply\r\nprefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at\r\nrandom; I will therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher\r\npowers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully\r\ntasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate\r\nfrivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and\r\n_bizarre_ motions, the various and variable values, what is only complex\r\nis mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The _attention_\r\nis here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an\r\noversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves\r\nbeing not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are\r\nmultiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative\r\nrather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the\r\ncontrary, where the moves are _unique_ and have but little variation,\r\nthe probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention\r\nbeing left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by\r\neither party are obtained by superior _acumen_. To be less abstract—Let\r\nus suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings,\r\nand where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that\r\nhere the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only\r\nby some _recherche_ movement, the result of some strong exertion of\r\nintellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself\r\ninto the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not\r\nunfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed\r\nabsurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into\r\nmiscalculation.\r\n\r\nWhist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the\r\ncalculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have\r\nbeen known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while\r\neschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a\r\nsimilar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best\r\nchess-player in Christendom _may_ be little more than the best player\r\nof chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all\r\nthese more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When\r\nI say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a\r\ncomprehension of _all_ the sources whence legitimate advantage may be\r\nderived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently\r\namong recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary\r\nunderstanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and,\r\nso far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist;\r\nwhile the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of\r\nthe game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have\r\na retentive memory, and to proceed by “the book,” are points commonly\r\nregarded as the sum total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond\r\nthe limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He\r\nmakes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps,\r\ndo his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information\r\nobtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the\r\nquality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of _what_ to\r\nobserve. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is\r\nthe object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game.\r\nHe examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with\r\nthat of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the\r\ncards in each hand; often counting trump by trump and honor by honor,\r\nthrough the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes every\r\nvariation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought\r\nfrom the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of\r\ntriumph, or chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges\r\nwhether the person taking it can make another in the suit. He recognizes\r\nwhat is played through feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the\r\ntable. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning\r\nof a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to\r\nits concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their\r\narrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation—all\r\nafford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true\r\nstate of affairs. The first two or three rounds having been played, he is\r\nin full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts\r\ndown his card with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of\r\nthe party had turned outward the faces of their own.\r\n\r\nThe analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for\r\nwhile the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often\r\nremarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power,\r\nby which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists\r\n(I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a\r\nprimitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect\r\nbordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation\r\namong writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there\r\nexists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and\r\nthe imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will be\r\nfound, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the _truly_\r\nimaginative never otherwise than analytic.\r\n\r\nThe narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the\r\nlight of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.\r\n\r\nResiding in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18—, I\r\nthere became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young\r\ngentleman was of an excellent—indeed of an illustrious family, but, by\r\na variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the\r\nenergy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir\r\nhimself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By\r\ncourtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small\r\nremnant of his patrimony; and upon the income arising from this, he\r\nmanaged, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of\r\nlife, without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books, indeed,\r\nwere his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.\r\n\r\nOur first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where\r\nthe accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very\r\nremarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other\r\nagain and again. I was deeply interested in the little family history\r\nwhich he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges\r\nwhenever mere self is the theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast\r\nextent of his reading; and above all, I felt my soul enkindled within\r\nme by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination.\r\nSeeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of\r\nsuch a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I\r\nfrankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live\r\ntogether during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were\r\nsomewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the\r\nexpense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather\r\nfantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion,\r\nlong deserted through superstitions into which we did not enquire, and\r\ntottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg\r\nSt. Germain.\r\n\r\nHad the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we\r\nshould have been regarded as madmen—although, perhaps, as madmen of a\r\nharmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors.\r\nIndeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret\r\nfrom my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin had\r\nceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to\r\nbe enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this _bizarrerie_, as\r\ninto all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims\r\nwith a perfect _abandon_. The sable divinity would not herself dwell\r\nwith us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn\r\nof the morning we closed all the massy shutters of our old building;\r\nlighted a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the\r\nghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our\r\nsouls in dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the\r\nclock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied forth into the\r\nstreet, arm and arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and\r\nwide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the\r\npopulous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation\r\ncan afford.\r\n\r\nAt such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from\r\nhis rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic\r\nability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its\r\nexercise—if not exactly in its display—and did not hesitate to confess\r\nthe pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh,\r\nthat most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms,\r\nand was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling\r\nproofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these movements\r\nwas frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his\r\nvoice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded\r\npetulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the\r\nenunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively\r\nupon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the\r\nfancy of a double Dupin—the creative and the resolvent.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing\r\nany mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the\r\nFrenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased\r\nintelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in\r\nquestion an example will best convey the idea.\r\n\r\nWe were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of\r\nthe Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither\r\nof us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once\r\nDupin broke forth with these words:—\r\n\r\n“He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better for the\r\nTheatre des Varietes.”\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not at first\r\nobserving (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary\r\nmanner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an\r\ninstant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.\r\n\r\n“Dupin,” said I gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension. I do not\r\nhesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How\r\nwas it possible you should know I was thinking of——?” Here I paused, to\r\nascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.\r\n\r\n——“of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you pause? You were remarking to\r\nyourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.”\r\n\r\nThis was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.\r\nChantilly was a _quondam_ cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming\r\nstage-mad, had attempted the _role_ of Xerxes, in Crebillon’s tragedy so\r\ncalled, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method—if method there\r\nis—by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.” In\r\nfact, I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.\r\n\r\n“It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to the\r\nconclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for\r\nXerxes _et id genus omne_.”\r\n\r\n“The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer whomsoever.”\r\n\r\n“The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may have been\r\nfifteen minutes ago.”\r\n\r\nI now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a\r\nlarge basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we\r\npassed from the Rue C⸺ into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what\r\nthis had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.\r\n\r\nThere was not a particle of _charlatanerie_ about Dupin. “I will\r\nexplain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will\r\nfirst retrace the course of meditations, from the moment in which I spoke\r\nto you until that of the _rencontre_ with the fruiterer in question.\r\nThe larger links of the chain run thus—Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols,\r\nEpicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.”\r\n\r\nThere are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives,\r\namused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions\r\nof their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full\r\nof interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished\r\nby the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the\r\nstarting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when\r\nI heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not\r\nhelp acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:\r\n\r\n“We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving\r\nthe Rue C⸺. This was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into\r\nthis street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing\r\nquickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a\r\nspot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the\r\nloose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed\r\nor sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then\r\nproceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did;\r\nbut observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.\r\n\r\n“You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant\r\nexpression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you\r\nwere still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley\r\ncalled Lamartine, which had been paved, by way of experiment, with the\r\noverlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up,\r\nand perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the\r\nword ‘stereotomy,’ a term very affectedly applied to this species of\r\npavement. I knew that you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without\r\nbeing brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus;\r\nand since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned\r\nto you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of\r\nthat noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony,\r\nI felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great\r\n_nebula_ in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did\r\nlook up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps.\r\nBut in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday’s\r\n‘_Musee_,’ the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the\r\ncobbler’s change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line\r\nabout which we have often conversed. I mean the line\r\n\r\n    Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.\r\n\r\nI had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written\r\nUrion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I\r\nwas aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore,\r\nthat you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly.\r\nThat you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which\r\npassed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation.\r\nSo far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw\r\nyourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon\r\nthe diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your\r\nmeditation to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow—that\r\nChantilly—he would do better at the _Theatre des Varietes_.”\r\n\r\nNot long after this we were looking over an evening edition of the\r\n“Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following paragraphs arrested our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n“EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS.—This morning, about three o’clock, the\r\ninhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a\r\nsuccession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth\r\nstory of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of\r\none Madame L’Espanaye, and her daughter, Mademoiselle Camille L’Espanaye.\r\nAfter some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to produce admission\r\nin the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight\r\nor ten of the neighbors entered, accompanied by two _gendarmes_. By\r\nthis time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first\r\nflight of stairs, two or more rough voices, in angry contention, were\r\ndistinguished, and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house.\r\nAs the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased, and\r\neverything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves and\r\nhurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the\r\nfourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with key inside,\r\nwas forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one\r\npresent not less with horror than with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“The apartment was in the wildest disorder—the furniture broken and\r\nthrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from\r\nthis the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor.\r\nOn a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or\r\nthree long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood,\r\nand seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were\r\nfound four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons,\r\nthree smaller of _metal d’ Alger_, and two bags, containing nearly four\r\nthousand francs in gold. The drawers of a _bureau_, which stood in one\r\ncorner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many\r\narticles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under\r\nthe bed (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the\r\ndoor. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of\r\nlittle consequence.\r\n\r\n“Of Madame L’Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity\r\nof soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the\r\nchimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head\r\ndownward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow\r\naperture for a considerable distance. The body was quite warm. Upon\r\nexamining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by\r\nthe violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the\r\nface were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and\r\ndeep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n“After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without\r\nfarther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the\r\nrear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her\r\nthroat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell\r\noff. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated—the former so\r\nmuch so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.\r\n\r\n“To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest\r\nclew.”\r\n\r\nThe next day’s paper had these additional particulars.\r\n\r\n“The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue. Many individuals have been examined in\r\nrelation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair.” [The word\r\n‘_affaire_’ has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it\r\nconveys with us,] “but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light\r\nupon it. We give below all the material testimony elicited.\r\n\r\n“Pauline Dubourg, laundress, deposes that she has known both the deceased\r\nfor three years, having washed for them during that period. The old lady\r\nand her daughter seemed on good terms—very affectionate towards each\r\nother. They were excellent pay. Could not speak in regard to their mode\r\nor means of living. Believed that Madame D. told fortunes for a living.\r\nWas reputed to have money put by. Never met any persons in the house when\r\nshe called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure that they had no\r\nservant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the\r\nbuilding except in the fourth story.\r\n\r\n“_Pierre Moreau_, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of\r\nselling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame L’Espanaye for\r\nnearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided\r\nthere. The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the\r\ncorpses were found, for more than six years. It was formerly occupied by\r\na jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons. The house\r\nwas the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of\r\nthe premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let\r\nany portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter\r\nsome five or six times during the six years. The two lived an exceedingly\r\nretired life—were reputed to have money. Had heard it said among the\r\nneighbors that Madame L. told fortunes—did not believe it. Had never seen\r\nany person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a porter\r\nonce or twice, and a physician some eight or ten times.\r\n\r\n“Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one\r\nwas spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there\r\nwere any living connections of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters\r\nof the front windows were seldom opened. Those in the rear were always\r\nclosed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The\r\nhouse was a good house—not very old.\r\n\r\n“Isidore Muset, _gendarme_, deposes that he was called to the house about\r\nthree o’clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at\r\nthe gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open, at length,\r\nwith a bayonet—not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty in getting\r\nit open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and bolted\r\nneither at bottom nor top. The shrieks were continued until the gate\r\nwas forced—and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of some\r\nperson (or persons) in great agony—were loud and drawn out, not short and\r\nquick. Witness led the way upstairs. Upon reaching the first landing,\r\nheard two voices in loud and angry contention—the one a gruff voice, the\r\nother much shriller—a very strange voice. Could distinguish some words of\r\nthe former, which was that of a Frenchman. Was positive that it was not\r\na woman’s voice. Could distinguish the words, ‘_sacre_’ and ‘_diable_.’\r\nThe shrill voice was that of a foreigner. Could not be sure whether it\r\nwas the voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make out what was said,\r\nbut believed the language to be Spanish. The state of the room and of the\r\nbodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday.\r\n\r\n“_Henri Duval_, a neighbor, and by trade a silversmith, deposes that\r\nhe was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the\r\ntestimony of Muset in general. As soon as they forced an entrance, they\r\nreclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast,\r\nnotwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, the witness\r\nthinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not\r\nbe sure that it was a man’s voice. It might have been a woman’s. Was not\r\nacquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words,\r\nbut was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian. Knew\r\nMadame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with both frequently. Was sure\r\nthat the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.\r\n\r\n“_⸺ Odenheimer, restaurateur._ The witness volunteered his testimony.\r\nNot speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of\r\nAmsterdam. Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted\r\nfor several minutes—probably ten. They were long and loud—very awful and\r\ndistressing. Was one of those who entered the building. Corroborated\r\nthe previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill\r\nvoice was that of a man—of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the words\r\nuttered. They were loud and quick—unequal—spoken apparently in fear as\r\nwell as in anger. The voice was harsh—not so much shrill as harsh. Could\r\nnot call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly ‘_sacre_,’\r\n‘_diable_’ and once ‘_mon Dieu_.’\r\n\r\n“_Jules Mignaud_, banker of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine.\r\nIs the elder Mignaud. Madame L’Espanaye had some property. Had opened\r\nan account with his banking house in the spring of the year ⸺ (eight\r\nyears previously). Made frequent deposits in small sums. Had checked for\r\nnothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in person\r\nthe sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk sent home\r\nwith the money.\r\n\r\n“_Adolphe Le Bon_, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in\r\nquestion, about noon, he accompanied Madame L’Espanaye to her residence\r\nwith the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened,\r\nMademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while\r\nthe old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did\r\nnot see any person in the street at the time. It is a bye-street—very\r\nlonely.\r\n\r\n“_William Bird_, tailor, deposes that he was one of the party who entered\r\nthe house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of the\r\nfirst to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff\r\nvoice was that of a Frenchman. Could make out several words, but cannot\r\nnow remember all. Heard distinctly ‘_sacre_’ and ‘_mon Dieu_.’ There was\r\na sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling—a scraping and\r\nscuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud—louder than the gruff\r\none. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman. Appeared to be\r\nthat of a German. Might have been a woman’s voice. Does not understand\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\n“Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the\r\ndoor of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was\r\nlocked on the inside when the party reached it. Everything was perfectly\r\nsilent—no groans or noises of any kind. Upon forcing the door no person\r\nwas seen. The windows, both of the back and front room, were down and\r\nfirmly fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was closed,\r\nbut not locked. The door leading from the front room into the passage\r\nwas locked, with the key on the inside. A small room in the front of\r\nthe house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage, was open,\r\nthe door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so\r\nforth. These were carefully removed and searched. There was not an inch\r\nof any portion of the house which was not carefully searched. Sweeps\r\nwere sent up and down the chimneys. The house was a four story one, with\r\ngarrets (_mansardes_). A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very\r\nsecurely—did not appear to have been opened for years. The time elapsing\r\nbetween the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of\r\nthe room door, was variously stated by the witnesses. Some made it as\r\nshort as three minutes—some as long as five. The door was opened with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n“_Alfonso Garcio_, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue Morgue.\r\nIs a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the house. Did not\r\nproceed upstairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences\r\nof agitation. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of\r\na Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was said. The shrill voice was\r\nthat of an Englishman—is sure of this. Does not understand the English\r\nlanguage, but judges by the intonation.\r\n\r\n“_Alberto Montani_, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first to\r\nascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was that\r\nof a Frenchman. Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared to be\r\nexpostulating. Could not make out the words of the shrill voice. Spoke\r\nquick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian. Corroborates the\r\ngeneral testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia.\r\n\r\n“Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the\r\nrooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human\r\nbeing. By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical sweeping-brushes, such as are\r\nemployed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed up end\r\ndown every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which any one\r\ncould have descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The body of\r\nMademoiselle L’Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could\r\nnot be got down until four or five of the party united their strength.\r\n\r\n“_Paul Dumas_, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies\r\nabout day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead\r\nin the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the young\r\nlady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it had been thrust\r\nup the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances. The\r\nthroat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches just below\r\nthe chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently\r\nthe impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the\r\neye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through.\r\nA large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced\r\napparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of M. Dumas,\r\nMademoiselle L’Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or\r\npersons unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All\r\nthe bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered. The left\r\n_tibia_ much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side. Whole\r\nbody dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not possible to say how\r\nthe injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar\r\nof iron—a chair—any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced\r\nsuch results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman\r\ncould have inflicted the blows with any weapon. The head of the deceased,\r\nwhen seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also\r\ngreatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp\r\ninstrument—probably with a razor.\r\n\r\n“_Alexandre Etienne_, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the\r\nbodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.\r\n\r\n“Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other\r\npersons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all\r\nits particulars, was never before committed in Paris—if indeed a murder\r\nhad been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault—an unusual\r\noccurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the shadow\r\nof a clue apparent.”\r\n\r\nThe evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement\r\nstill continued in the Quartier St. Roch—that the premises in question\r\nhad been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses\r\ninstituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript, however, mentioned that\r\nAdolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned—although nothing appeared\r\nto criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.\r\n\r\nDupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair—at\r\nleast so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only\r\nafter the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me\r\nmy opinion respecting the murders.\r\n\r\nI could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble\r\nmystery. I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the\r\nmurderer.\r\n\r\n“We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin, “by this shell of an\r\nexamination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for _acumen_, are\r\ncunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond\r\nthe method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not\r\nunfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the object proposed, as to put\r\nus in mind of Monsieur Jourdain’s calling for his _robe-de-chambre—pour\r\nmieux entendre la musique_. The results attained by them are not\r\nunfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by\r\nsimple diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing, their\r\nschemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering\r\nman. But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very\r\nintensity of his investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the\r\nobject too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual\r\nclearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter\r\nas a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is\r\nnot always in a well. In fact, as regards the more important knowledge,\r\nI do believe that she is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the\r\nvalleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain tops where she is\r\nfound. The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in\r\nthe contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances—to\r\nview it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions\r\nof the _retina_ (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than\r\nthe interior), is to behold the star distinctly—is to have the best\r\nappreciation of its lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in proportion\r\nas we turn our vision _fully_ upon it. A greater number of rays actually\r\nfall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the\r\nmore refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex\r\nand enfeeble thought; and it is very possible to make even Venus herself\r\nvanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated,\r\nor too direct.\r\n\r\n“As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves,\r\nbefore we make up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us\r\namusement,” [I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing]\r\n“and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am not\r\nungrateful. We will go and see the premises with our own eyes. I know\r\nG⸺, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the\r\nnecessary permission.”\r\n\r\nThe permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue.\r\nThis is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the\r\nRue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we\r\nreached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we\r\nresided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons\r\ngazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from\r\nthe opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with\r\na gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding\r\npanel in the window, indicating a _loge de concierge_. Before going in\r\nwe walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning,\r\npassed in the rear of the building—Dupin, meanwhile, examining the whole\r\nneighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for\r\nwhich I could see no possible object.\r\n\r\nRetracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang,\r\nand, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge.\r\nWe went up stairs—into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle\r\nL’Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The\r\ndisorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist. I saw\r\nnothing beyond what had been stated in the “Gazette des Tribunaux.” Dupin\r\nscrutinised every thing—not excepting the bodies of the victims. We then\r\nwent into the other rooms, and into the yard; a _gendarme_ accompanying\r\nus throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our\r\ndeparture. On our way home my companion stopped in for a moment at the\r\noffice of one of the daily papers.\r\n\r\nI have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that _Je les\r\nmenageais_—for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his\r\nhumor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder,\r\nuntil about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had\r\nobserved anything _peculiar_ at the scene of the atrocity.\r\n\r\nThere was something in his manner of emphasizing the word “peculiar,”\r\nwhich caused me to shudder, without knowing why.\r\n\r\n“No, nothing _peculiar_,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than we both\r\nsaw stated in the paper.”\r\n\r\n“The ‘Gazette,’” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the unusual\r\nhorror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It\r\nappears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very\r\nreason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution—I mean\r\nfor the _outre_ character of its features. The police are confounded\r\nby the seeming absence of motive—not for the murder itself—but for\r\nthe atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming\r\nimpossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with\r\nthe facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated\r\nMademoiselle L’Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without\r\nnotice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the corpse\r\nthrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation\r\nof the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those just\r\nmentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze\r\nthe powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted _acumen_, of the\r\ngovernment agents. They have fallen into the gross but common error of\r\nconfounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations\r\nfrom the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in\r\nits search for the true. In investigations such as we are now pursuing,\r\nit should not be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’ as ‘what has occurred\r\nthat has never occurred before.’ In fact, the facility with which I shall\r\narrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the\r\ndirect ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police.”\r\n\r\nI stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.\r\n\r\n“I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of our\r\napartment—“I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the\r\nperpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure\r\nimplicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes\r\ncommitted, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right in\r\nthe supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire\r\nriddle. I look for the man here—in this room—every moment. It is true\r\nthat he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will. Should he\r\ncome, it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both\r\nknow how to use them when occasion demands their use.”\r\n\r\nI took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I\r\nheard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have\r\nalready spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was\r\naddressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that\r\nintonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great\r\ndistance. His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.\r\n\r\n“That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party upon the\r\nstairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by\r\nthe evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether\r\nthe old lady could have first destroyed the daughter, and afterwards\r\nhave committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of\r\nmethod; for the strength of Madame L’Espanaye would have been utterly\r\nunequal to the task of thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney as\r\nit was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely\r\npreclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed\r\nby some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard\r\nin contention. Let me now advert—not to the whole testimony respecting\r\nthese voices—but to what was peculiar in that testimony. Did you observe\r\nanything peculiar about it?”\r\n\r\nI remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff\r\nvoice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to\r\nthe shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.\r\n\r\n“That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but it was not the\r\npeculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive. Yet\r\nthere was something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark, agreed\r\nabout the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to the\r\nshrill voice, the peculiarity is—not that they disagreed—but that, while\r\nan Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman\r\nattempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner.\r\nEach is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen. Each\r\nlikens it—not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose\r\nlanguage he is conversant—but the converse. The Frenchman supposes it\r\nthe voice of a Spaniard, and ‘might have distinguished some words had\r\nhe been acquainted with the Spanish.’ The Dutchman maintains it to have\r\nbeen that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that ‘not understanding\r\nFrench this witness was examined through an interpreter.’ The Englishman\r\nthinks it the voice of a German, and ‘does not understand German.’ The\r\nSpaniard ‘is sure’ that it was that of an Englishman, but ‘judges by the\r\nintonation’ altogether, ‘as he has no knowledge of the English.’ The\r\nItalian believes it the voice of a Russian, but ‘has never conversed\r\nwith a native of Russia.’ A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the\r\nfirst, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, ‘not\r\nbeing cognizant of that tongue,’ is, like the Spaniard, ‘convinced by\r\nthe intonation.’ Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really\r\nbeen, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited!—in\r\nwhose _tones_, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could\r\nrecognize nothing familiar! You will say that it might have been the\r\nvoice of an Asiatic—of an African. Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound\r\nin Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your\r\nattention to three points. The voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh\r\nrather than shrill.’ It is represented by two others to have been ‘quick\r\nand _unequal_.’ No words—no sounds resembling words—were by any witnesses\r\nmentioned as distinguishable.\r\n\r\n“I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression I may have made, so\r\nfar, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that\r\nlegitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony—the portion\r\nrespecting the gruff and shrill voices—are in themselves sufficient to\r\nengender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress\r\nin the investigation of the mystery. I said ‘legitimate deductions;’\r\nbut my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to imply that\r\nthe deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises\r\n_inevitably_ from them as the single result. What the suspicion is\r\nhowever, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to bear in mind that,\r\nwith myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form—a\r\ncertain tendency—to my inquiries in the chamber.\r\n\r\n“Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall\r\nwe first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It\r\nis not too much to say that neither of us believe in praeternatural\r\nevents, Madame and Mademoiselle L’Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits.\r\nThe doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how?\r\nFortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and\r\nthat mode must lead us to a definite decision. Let us examine, each by\r\neach, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were\r\nin the room where Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was found, or at least in the\r\nroom adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from\r\nthese two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid\r\nbare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every\r\ndirection. No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance. But, not\r\ntrusting to their eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then, no\r\nsecret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were\r\nsecurely locked, with keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys. These,\r\nalthough of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths,\r\nwill not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat. The\r\nimpossibility of egress by means already stated, being thus absolute, we\r\nare reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room no one could\r\nhave escaped without notice from the crowd in the street. The murderers\r\nmust have passed, then, through those of the back room. Now, brought to\r\nthis conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part,\r\nas reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities. It is\r\nonly left for us to prove that these apparent ‘impossibilities’ are, in\r\nreality, not such.\r\n\r\n“There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by\r\nfurniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is\r\nhidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust\r\nclose up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within.\r\nIt resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A\r\nlarge gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very\r\nstout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining\r\nthe other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted into it; and\r\na vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police are now\r\nentirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And,\r\n_therefore_, it was thought a matter of superogation to withdraw the\r\nnails and open the windows.\r\n\r\n“My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the\r\nreason I have just given—because here it was, I knew, that all apparent\r\nimpossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality.\r\n\r\n“I proceeded to think thus—_a posteriori_. The murderers _did_ escape\r\nfrom one of these windows. This being so, they could not have re-fastened\r\nthe sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened—the consideration\r\nwhich put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the\r\npolice in this quarter. Yet the sashes _were_ fastened. They must,\r\nthen, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape from\r\nthis conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the\r\nnail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted\r\nall my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring must, I now\r\nknew, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my\r\npremises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the\r\ncircumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light\r\nthe hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery,\r\nforebore to upraise the sash.\r\n\r\n“I now replaced the nail and regulated it attentively. A person passing\r\nout through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would\r\nhave caught—but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion\r\nwas plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The\r\nassassins _must_ have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then,\r\nthe springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there _must_\r\nbe found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes\r\nof their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked\r\nover the headboard minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand down\r\nbehind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was,\r\nas I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor. I now looked\r\nat the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the\r\nsame manner—driven in nearly up to the head.\r\n\r\n“You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have\r\nmisunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I\r\nhad not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had never for an instant been\r\nlost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret\r\nto its ultimate result—and that result was the _nail_. It had, I say,\r\nin every respect the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but\r\nthis fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be)\r\nwhen compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated\r\nthe clew, ‘There must be something wrong,’ I said, ‘about the nail.’ I\r\ntouched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank,\r\ncame off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole,\r\nwhere it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its edges\r\nwere incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the\r\nblow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom\r\nsash, the head portion of the nail. I now carefully replaced this head\r\nportion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance\r\nto a perfect nail was complete—the fissure was invisible. Pressing the\r\nspring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with\r\nit, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of\r\nthe whole nail was again perfect.\r\n\r\n“The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through\r\nthe window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon\r\nhis exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the\r\nspring and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken\r\nby the police for that of the nail—farther inquiry being thus considered\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n“The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I\r\nhad been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five\r\nfeet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning\r\nrod. From this rod it would have been impossible for anyone to reach\r\nthe window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however,\r\nthat the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called\r\nby Parisian carpenters _ferrades_—a kind rarely employed at the present\r\nday, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux.\r\nThey are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door)\r\nexcept that the upper half is latticed or worked in open trellis—thus\r\naffording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these\r\nshutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the\r\nrear of the house, they were both about half open—that is to say, they\r\nstood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the police,\r\nas well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in\r\nlooking at these _ferrades_ in the line of their breadth (as they must\r\nhave done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all\r\nevents, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once\r\nsatisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter,\r\nthey would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear\r\nto me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of\r\nthe bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet\r\nof the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very\r\nunusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from\r\nthe rod, might have been thus effected. By reaching to the distance of\r\ntwo feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent)\r\na robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work. Letting go,\r\nthen, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall,\r\nand springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to\r\nclose it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even\r\nhave swung himself into the room.\r\n\r\n“I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very\r\nunusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and\r\nso difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing\r\nmight possibly have been accomplished—but, secondly and _chiefly_, I wish\r\nto impress upon your understanding the very _extraordinary_—the almost\r\npraeternatural character of the agility which could have accomplished it.\r\n\r\n“You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to make out\r\nmy case’ I should rather undervalue than insist upon a full estimation\r\nof the activity required in this matter. This may be the practice in\r\nlaw, but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object is only the\r\ntruth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxta-position\r\nthat _very unusual_ activity of which I have just spoken, with that _very\r\npeculiar_ shrill (or harsh) and _unequal_ voice, about whose nationality\r\nno two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no\r\nsyllabification could be detected.”\r\n\r\nAt these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Dupin\r\nflitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension,\r\nwithout power to comprehend—as men, at times, find themselves upon the\r\nbrink of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. My\r\nfriend went on with his discourse.\r\n\r\n“You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from the mode\r\nof egress to that of ingress. It was my design to suggest that both were\r\neffected in the same manner, at the same point. Let us now revert to the\r\ninterior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here. The drawers\r\nof the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of\r\napparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It is\r\na mere guess—a very silly one—and no more. How are we to know that the\r\narticles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally\r\ncontained? Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly\r\nretired life—saw no company—seldom went out—had little use for numerous\r\nchange of habiliment. Those found were at least of as good quality as any\r\nlikely to be possessed by these ladies. If a thief had taken any, why\r\ndid he not take the best—why did he not take all? In a word, why did he\r\nabandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of\r\nlinen? The gold was abandoned. Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur\r\nMignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you,\r\ntherefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of _motive_,\r\nengendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence\r\nwhich speaks of money delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences\r\nten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder\r\ncommitted within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all\r\nof us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice.\r\nCoincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that\r\nclass of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory\r\nof probabilities—that theory to which the most glorious objects of human\r\nresearch are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In the\r\npresent instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three\r\ndays before would have formed something more than a coincidence. It would\r\nhave been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the real\r\ncircumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this\r\noutrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as\r\nto have abandoned his gold and his motive together.\r\n\r\n“Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your\r\nattention—that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling\r\nabsence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this—let us\r\nglance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death by\r\nmanual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinarily\r\nassassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they\r\nthus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse\r\nup the chimney, you will admit that there was something excessively\r\n_outre_—something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of\r\nhuman action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men.\r\nThink, too, how great must have been that strength which could have\r\nthrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of\r\nseveral persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down!\r\n\r\n“Turn now to other indications of the employment of a vigor most\r\nmarvelous. On the hearth were thick tresses—very thick tresses—of grey\r\nhuman hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of the\r\ngreat force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or\r\nthirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself.\r\nTheir roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh\r\nof the scalp—sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted\r\nin uprooting perhaps half a million hairs at a time. The throat of the\r\nold lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the\r\nbody—the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at the\r\nbrutal ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of Madame\r\nL’Espanaye I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor\r\nMonsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse\r\ninstrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse\r\ninstrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the\r\nvictim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This\r\nidea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same\r\nreason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them—because, by the\r\naffair of the nails, their perceptions have been hermetically sealed\r\nagainst the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.\r\n\r\n“If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected\r\nupon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine\r\nthe ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity\r\nbrutal, a butchery without motive, a _grotesquerie_ in horror absolutely\r\nalien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of\r\nmany nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification.\r\nWhat result, then, has ensued? What impression have I made upon your\r\nfancy?”\r\n\r\nI felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question. “A\r\nmadman,” I said, “has done this deed—some raving maniac, escaped from a\r\nneighboring _Maison de Sante_.”\r\n\r\n“In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant. But the\r\nvoices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to\r\ntally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen are of some\r\nnation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always\r\nthe coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not\r\nsuch as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the\r\nrigidly clutched fingers of Madame L’Espanaye. Tell me what you can make\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\n“Dupin!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most unusual—this is\r\nno _human_ hair.”\r\n\r\n“I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but before we decide this\r\npoint, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon\r\nthis paper. It is a _fac-simile_ drawing of what has been described in\r\none portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises, and deep indentations\r\nof finger nails,’ upon the throat of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and in\r\nanother, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a ‘series of livid spots,\r\nevidently the impression of fingers.’\r\n\r\n“You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the paper\r\nupon the table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a firm\r\nand fixed hold. There is no _slipping_ apparent. Each finger has\r\nretained—possibly until the death of the victim—the fearful grasp by\r\nwhich it originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your\r\nfingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them.”\r\n\r\nI made the attempt in vain.\r\n\r\n“We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said. “The\r\npaper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is\r\ncylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is\r\nabout that of the throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the\r\nexperiment again.”\r\n\r\nI did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before.\r\n\r\n“This,” I said, “is the mark of no human hand.”\r\n\r\n“Read now,” replied Dupin, “this passage from Cuvier.”\r\n\r\nIt was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the\r\nlarge fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic\r\nstature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the\r\nimitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to\r\nall. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.\r\n\r\n“The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of reading,\r\n“is in exact accordance with this drawing. I see that no animal but\r\nan Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed\r\nthe indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair,\r\ntoo, is identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I\r\ncannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery.\r\nBesides, there were two voices heard in contention, and one of them was\r\nunquestionably the voice of a Frenchman.”\r\n\r\n“True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously,\r\nby the evidence, to this voice—the expression, ‘mon Dieu!’ This,\r\nunder the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the\r\nwitnesses (Montani, the confectioner) as an expression of remonstrance\r\nor expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built\r\nmy hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of\r\nthe murder. It is possible—indeed it is far more than probable—that he\r\nwas innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took\r\nplace. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him. He may have traced it\r\nto the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he\r\ncould never have re-captured it. It is still at large. I will not pursue\r\nthese guesses—for I have no right to call them more—since the shades of\r\nreflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth\r\nto be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to\r\nmake them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will call them\r\nguesses then, and speak of them as such. If the Frenchman in question is\r\nindeed, as I suppose, innocent, of this atrocity, this advertisement,\r\nwhich I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of ‘Le\r\nMonde,’ (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by\r\nsailors,) will bring him to our residence.”\r\n\r\nHe handed me a paper, and I read thus:\r\n\r\n    CAUGHT—_In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the\r\n    ⸺ inst._, (the morning of the murder), _a very large, tawny\r\n    Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species. The owner, who is\r\n    ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel, may\r\n    have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily and\r\n    paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping. Call\r\n    at No. ⸺, Rue ⸺, Faubourg St. Germain—au troisieme._\r\n\r\n“How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man to be a\r\nsailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know it,” said Dupin. “I am not sure of it. Here, however,\r\nis a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy\r\nappearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those\r\nlong queues of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one\r\nwhich few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I\r\npicked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have\r\nbelonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my\r\ninduction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging\r\nto a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did\r\nin the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I\r\nhave been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the\r\ntrouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant\r\nalthough innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate\r\nabout replying to the advertisement—about demanding the Ourang-Outang. He\r\nwill reason thus:—‘I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great\r\nvalue—to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself—why should I lose it\r\nthrough idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my grasp. It was\r\nfound in the Bois de Boulogne—at a vast distance from the scene of that\r\nbutchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have\r\ndone the deed? The police are at fault—they have failed to procure the\r\nslightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible\r\nto prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on\r\naccount of that cognizance. Above all, I am known. The advertiser\r\ndesignates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to what limit\r\nhis knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property of so great\r\nvalue, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal, at\r\nleast, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract attention\r\neither to myself or to the beast. I will answer the advertisement, get\r\nthe Ourang-Outang; and keep it close until this matter has blown over.’”\r\n\r\nAt this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.\r\n\r\n“Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but neither use them nor show\r\nthem until at a signal from myself.”\r\n\r\nThe front door of the house had been left open, and the visitor had\r\nentered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase.\r\nNow, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently we heard him descending.\r\nDupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up.\r\nHe did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision and\r\nrapped at the door of our chamber.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone.\r\n\r\nA man entered. He was a sailor, evidently,—a tall, stout, and\r\nmuscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of\r\ncountenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt,\r\nwas more than half hidden by whisker and _mustachio_. He had with him\r\na huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed\r\nawkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in French accents, which, although\r\nsomewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, my friend,” said Dupin. “I suppose you have called about the\r\nOurang-Outang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him;\r\na remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal. How old do you\r\nsuppose him to be?”\r\n\r\nThe sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some\r\nintolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:\r\n\r\n“I have no way of telling—but he can’t be more than four or five years\r\nold. Have you got him here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh no; we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery\r\nstable in the Rue Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the morning. Of\r\ncourse you are prepared to identify the property?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure I am, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,”\r\nsaid the man. “Couldn’t expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for\r\nthe finding of the animal—that is to say, anything in reason.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me\r\nthink!—what should I have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall be this.\r\nYou shall give me all the information in your power about these murders\r\nin the Rue Morgue.”\r\n\r\nDupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as\r\nquietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it, and put the key in\r\nhis pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without\r\nthe least flurry, upon the table.\r\n\r\nThe sailor’s face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.\r\nHe started to his feet and grasped his cudgel; but the next moment he\r\nfell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance\r\nof death itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the bottom of my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you are alarming yourself\r\nunnecessarily—you are indeed. We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge\r\nyou the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no\r\ninjury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in\r\nthe Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some\r\nmeasure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know\r\nthat I have had means of information about this matter—means of which\r\nyou could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus. You have done\r\nnothing which you could have avoided—nothing, certainly, which renders\r\nyou culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have\r\nrobbed with impunity. You have nothing to conceal. You have no reason for\r\nconcealment. On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor\r\nto confess all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with\r\nthat crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while\r\nDupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n“So help me God,” said he, after a brief pause, “I will tell you all I\r\nknow about this affair;—but I do not expect you to believe one half I\r\nsay—I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still, I am innocent, and I will\r\nmake a clean breast if I die for it.”\r\n\r\nWhat he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage\r\nto the Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed at\r\nBorneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure. Himself\r\nand a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang. This companion dying,\r\nthe animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After great trouble,\r\noccasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home\r\nvoyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence\r\nin Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity\r\nof his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it\r\nshould recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on\r\nboard ship. His ultimate design was to sell it.\r\n\r\nReturning home from some sailor’s frolic on the night, or rather in the\r\nmorning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room,\r\ninto which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as\r\nwas thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was\r\nsitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in\r\nwhich it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole\r\nof the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the\r\npossession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the\r\nman, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been accustomed,\r\nhowever, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of\r\na whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang\r\nsprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and\r\nthence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand,\r\noccasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until\r\nthe latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this\r\nmanner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly\r\nquiet, as it was nearly three o’clock in the morning. In passing down\r\nan alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive’s attention was\r\narrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L’Espanaye’s\r\nchamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it\r\nperceived the lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility,\r\ngrasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and,\r\nby its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The\r\nwhole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by\r\nthe Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had\r\nstrong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape\r\nfrom the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it\r\nmight be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was much\r\ncause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter\r\nreflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning-rod\r\nis ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had\r\narrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was\r\nstopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to\r\nobtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly\r\nfell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those\r\nhideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the\r\ninmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter, habited\r\nin their night clothes, had apparently been arranging some papers in the\r\niron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of\r\nthe room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. The\r\nvictims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and,\r\nfrom the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams,\r\nit seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. The flapping-to\r\nof the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.\r\n\r\nAs the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L’Espanaye\r\nby the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was\r\nflourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a\r\nbarber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned. The\r\nscreams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn\r\nfrom her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes\r\nof the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined sweep of\r\nits muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The sight of\r\nblood inflamed its anger into frenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing\r\nfire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its\r\nfearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired.\r\nIts wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the\r\nbed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just\r\ndiscernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the\r\ndreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having\r\ndeserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds,\r\nand skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing\r\ndown and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from\r\nthe bedstead. In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter,\r\nand thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady,\r\nwhich it immediately hurled through the window headlong.\r\n\r\nAs the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor\r\nshrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it,\r\nhurried at once home—dreading the consequences of the butchery, and\r\ngladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the\r\nOurang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the\r\nFrenchman’s exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the\r\nfiendish jabberings of the brute.\r\n\r\nI have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped\r\nfrom the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door. It\r\nmust have closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently\r\ncaught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the\r\n_Jardin des Plantes_. Le Bon was instantly released, upon our narration\r\nof the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the _bureau_\r\nof the Prefect of Police. This functionary, however well disposed to\r\nmy friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which\r\naffairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the\r\npropriety of every person minding his own business.\r\n\r\n“Let them talk,” said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply.\r\n“Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience. I am satisfied with\r\nhaving defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed in\r\nthe solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which\r\nhe supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too\r\ncunning to be profound. In his wisdom is no _stamen_. It is all head and\r\nno body, like the picture of the Goddess Laverna,—or, at best, all head\r\nand shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature, after all.\r\nI like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has\r\nattained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the way he has ‘_de nier ce\r\nqui est, et d’expliquer ce qui n’est pas_.’”[A]\r\n\r\n[A] Rousseau, Nouvelle Heloise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKilted Wraith and Bagpipe Spook Communicate With Spiritualists\r\n\r\n\r\nA most colorful procession of spirits passed before the recent convention\r\nof the Illinois Spiritualist Association. There was a Highland gentleman\r\nwith kilts of Stewart tartan who came to give a message to “Mary,” and\r\nwho was accompanied by an uncle who played the bagpipe. “Eleanor Ives,”\r\na little girl of four, returned to tell her mother that all was well\r\nin the world beyond. At first, she said, she had hated to go, but now\r\nshe is happy and often visits her mother. Lastly, a colored “mammy” was\r\nmaterialized by Mrs. Waite, the medium. She was seen sitting before a\r\ncabin door smoking an old corncob pipe. She said she had a message for\r\nher granddaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Here’s the Final, Thrilling Installment of_\r\n\r\nTHE MOON TERROR\r\n\r\n_By_ A. G. BIRCH\r\n\r\n    _The first half of this story was published in the May issue\r\n    of WEIRD TALES. A copy will be mailed by the publishers for\r\n    twenty-five cents._\r\n\r\n    SUMMARY OF THE FIRST INSTALLMENT\r\n\r\n    The earth is rocked to its foundation, and the end of the world\r\n    is threatened, by a mysterious, unseen power known only as\r\n    “KWO.” At regular intervals, gigantic earthquakes and tidal\r\n    waves visit the earth, destroying great cities and spreading\r\n    terror. Dr. Ferdinand Gresham, American astronomer, attributes\r\n    all this to the Seuen-H’Sin, a Chinese sect with which he is\r\n    familiar. Finally, when the life of the world seems doomed,\r\n    he gains permission from the U. S. Navy Department to proceed\r\n    in the destroyer, Albatross, to the lair of “KWO” and do\r\n    everything possible to stop the world-wide havoc. Accompanied\r\n    by his friend, Arthur (who tells the story), the astronomer\r\n    sails to a lonely spot in the frozen North, where they discover\r\n    the diabolical power plant of “KWO.” It has developed,\r\n    meanwhile, that “KWO” and his sorcerers are moon worshipers and\r\n    are endeavoring to create a second moon by splitting the earth\r\n    in two. In the Moon God’s Temple Dr. Gresham and his friend,\r\n    disguised as Chinese, witness the weird rites of the sect, in\r\n    which a human being is sacrificed, and then their identity is\r\n    discovered. Attacked, they flee back toward their ship, but\r\n    the earth seems suddenly to open, and Arthur is swallowed in a\r\n    black pit.\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER NINE STARTS FROM THIS POINT\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IX_\r\n\r\nIN THE SORCERERS’ POWER\r\n\r\nWhat happened immediately after that first drop into the abyss I do not\r\nknow. My only recollection is of hurtling down a steep incline amid a\r\nsmothering avalanche of dirt, of striking heavily upon a rocky ledge, and\r\nof bounding off again into the inky void as my senses left me.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I knew was the slow dawn of a sensation of cold; and then\r\nmy eyes fluttered open and I beheld the moon shining upon me through a\r\nrent in the surrounding blackness. At first I was too dazed to comprehend\r\nanything that had occurred, but soon, with considerable pain, I raised\r\nmyself upon one elbow and looked about, whereupon understanding gradually\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe place where I lay was a mud-covered ledge upon one of the steep,\r\nsloping walls of a huge chasm that had opened in the earth. The gash\r\nwas probably seventy-five feet across at this point, and above me the\r\nwalls soared perhaps a hundred feet. Within arm’s reach the shelf that\r\nsupported me broke off in a precipice. I was half imbedded in soft mud,\r\nand was soaked to the skin and nearly frozen.\r\n\r\nHow long I had lain there I could not tell, but I judged it had not been\r\nmore that two or three hours, for the moon still was high in the heavens.\r\n\r\nAll at once, as I gazed upon the weird scene, my heart leaped with\r\nanguish at remembrance of my vanished comrade, Dr. Ferdinand Gresham.\r\nHe had dropped before me into the chasm, and therefore must have fallen\r\nclear of the ledge and plunged into the depths!\r\n\r\nThrusting myself to the edge of the precipice, I peered below. Nothing\r\nrewarded my gaze except horrifying silence and vapory gloom. The pain of\r\nthe movement was so intense that I fell back almost in a swoon.\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, I saw that the moon was drawing near the rim of the\r\ngorge and that I would soon be engulfed in utter darkness, so I turned\r\nmy eyes up the jagged wall in search of some means of escape. After\r\nconsiderable study, I thought I could discern a way to the summit.\r\n\r\nBut just then another surprise caught my gaze: the strip of sky above the\r\nchasm appeared narrower than when I had first turned my eyes upward. For\r\na few moments I attributed this to an optical illusion produced by some\r\nswiftly-moving clouds overhead; but all at once the hideous truth burst\r\nupon me—_the crack in the earth was drawing shut_!\r\n\r\nHeedless of the pain, I flung myself against the cliff—climbing in utter\r\npanic, for fear the chasm would close completely before I could get out.\r\n\r\nThe ascent was difficult and perilous in the extreme. Often rocks\r\nloosened beneath my fingers, starting miniature avalanches, and I\r\nflattened myself against the wall in a paroxysm of terror and clung there\r\nuntil the danger passed.\r\n\r\nFor a space that seemed hours long I continued to claw my way upward—with\r\nthe prodigious trap closing steadily upon me. At times I found myself\r\nbelow unscalable surfaces, and was obliged to descend a bit and start\r\nover again in a new direction; and often it seemed as if the pain of my\r\ninjuries would cause me to faint.\r\n\r\nWhen I had come within thirty feet of the top, the climb developed into a\r\nveritable race with death, for the opposite wall was now almost upon me.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, I found the way blocked by a sheer, unscalable wall,\r\nupon which only a fly could have found a foothold! Simultaneously I saw\r\nthat the moon was right at the rim of the chasm, and that in a minute the\r\nlight would vanish.\r\n\r\nWith the realization of my plight, panic seized me, and I beat my head\r\nagainst the wall and shrieked aloud.\r\n\r\nAnd, though I could not guess it then, that very outcry of despair was to\r\nsave my life.\r\n\r\nHardly had my first shriek gone forth before a head appeared directly\r\nabove me, and a voice rang out:\r\n\r\n“Here he is, fellows! Quick with that rope!”\r\n\r\nWith leaping heart, I recognized the voice as Dr. Gresham’s!\r\n\r\nAn instant later a rope with a loop in the end of it dangled beside me,\r\nand a number of hands reached out to pull me to safety. Another moment,\r\nand I was drawn over the brink—not one second too soon, for as I made the\r\nlast dozen feet the closing walls of the pit brushed my body.\r\n\r\nExhausted and trembling, I sank upon the ground, while a number of\r\nfigures crowded about me. These proved to be twenty-five men from the\r\n_Albatross_, under command of Ensign Wiles Hallock. They were all dressed\r\nin the dark blue garments of the sorcerers. How they came to be there was\r\nbriefly related by Dr. Gresham.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground had opened beneath us earlier in the evening, the\r\nastronomer had clutched the roots of a tree, and within a few seconds\r\nafter I had dropped from sight he was back on firm ground. The Chinamen\r\nwho had been pursuing us had either fallen into the gash or had fled in\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nConsiderable vapor was rising from the pit, but the scientist noticed\r\nthat this was clearing rapidly, so he decided to linger at the spot\r\nawhile, with the forlorn hope that I might be found. Soon the vapor\r\nvanished and, as the moonlight was shining directly into the crack, the\r\ndoctor began a search.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he discerned a figure lying upon a ledge below. Close\r\nscrutiny revealed that the dark costume characteristic of the Seuen-H’sin\r\nwas torn, displaying an orange garment beneath.\r\n\r\nConfident that none of the sorcerers would be wearing two suits at once\r\nin this fashion, the scientist concluded the figure was mine. For a time\r\nhe doubted whether I lived, but eventually he thought he saw me stir\r\nfeebly, whereupon he began frantic efforts to reach me.\r\n\r\nRepeated attempts to descend the precipice failed. Then he tried dropping\r\npebbles to arouse me. Again unsuccessful, he risked attracting the\r\nsorcerers back to the spot by shouting into the chasm.\r\n\r\nAll his efforts proved futile, so he finally returned to the destroyer\r\nand obtained this rescue party.\r\n\r\nIn grateful silence I gripped his hand.\r\n\r\n“Now,” the astronomer concluded, “if you are able to walk, we will get\r\nback to the ship. It is only 1 o’clock, and if we hurry there still is\r\ntime to attack the Seuen-H’sin before daylight. Conditions throughout\r\nthe world are so alarming that we must put this power plant out of\r\nbusiness without delay!”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead!” I assented. “I’m able to hobble along!”\r\n\r\nIt was less than two miles to the destroyer’s anchorage, they said.\r\nDuring the march none of the sorcerers was sighted, with which we began\r\nto conclude that the cracking of the earth had affected the village on\r\nthe other side of the mountain so that all their lookouts had been called\r\nin.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, when we were less than half a mile from the vessel, the\r\nstillness of the night was shattered by the shrill blast of a whistle.\r\nA series of other wild shrieks from the steam chant came in quick\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n“The _Albatross_!” exclaimed Ensign Hallock. “Something’s happening?”\r\n\r\nWe burst into a run—the whistle still screaming through the night.\r\n\r\nAll at once the sound ceased, and as the echoes died out among the hills\r\nwe heard the rattle of firearms.\r\n\r\n“An attack!” cried Hallock. “The sorcerers have attacked the ship!”\r\n\r\nThen, abruptly, the firing, too, died out.\r\n\r\nA few moments later we emerged from the ravine onto the bank of the fiord\r\nand into full view of the destroyer. The passing of the moon into the\r\nwest had brought the vessel within its rays—and the sight that greeted us\r\nalmost froze our blood!\r\n\r\nSwarming about the deck were dozens of Chinamen—some with rifles, some\r\nwith knives. They appeared to be completely in control of the ship.\r\nNumerous pairs of them were coming up from below decks, carrying the\r\nbodies of the vessel’s crew, which they carelessly tossed overboard.\r\nEvidently they had taken our companions by surprise and wiped them out!\r\n\r\nAt this sight Ensign Hallock and his men became frenzied with rage.\r\n\r\n“Ready, men!” the officer announced to his followers. “We’re going down\r\nthere and give those murderers something to remember!”\r\n\r\nEagerly the seamen prepared to charge the ship. But Dr. Gresham stopped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“It’s no use,” he said. “There are hundreds of the sorcerers down\r\nthere—and only a handful of us. You would only be throwing away your\r\nlives and defeating the whole purpose of this expedition. We must find a\r\nbetter way.”\r\n\r\nThe astronomer’s counsel prevailed. Whereupon we debated what should be\r\ndone. The situation was desperate. Here we were, completely isolated in\r\na grim wilderness, hundreds of miles from help, and surrounded by hordes\r\nof savage fanatics. Soon, no doubt, the sorcerers’ spies would find us.\r\nAnd, meanwhile, we were helpless to put an end to the terrors that were\r\nengulfing the planet and its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSo despair gradually took possession of us. Not even the customary\r\nresourcefulness of Dr. Gresham rose to the emergency.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ensign Hallock gave an exclamation of excitement.\r\n\r\n“_The Nippon!_” he burst out. “Let’s turn the tables on the Chinese, and\r\nseize the _Nippon_! She’s probably got a guard on board, but maybe we can\r\ntake it by surprise!”\r\n\r\n“What could we do with her?” I objected. “She needs a large crew—and\r\nthere are only twenty-seven of us!”\r\n\r\n“We’ll sail her away, of course!” replied the young naval officer with\r\nenthusiasm. “There must be fuel on board, for her fires are going. Three\r\nof the boys here are apprentice engineers. I can do the navigating. And\r\nthe rest of you can take turns stoking the boilers!”\r\n\r\n“But how could we slip past the _Albatross_?” asked Dr. Gresham.\r\n\r\nEnsign Hallock seemed to have thought of that, too, for he promptly\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“The _Albatross_ is an oil-burning craft, with the new type of burners\r\nthat came into use since these Chinks have been stowed away here in the\r\nwilderness. The mechanism for using the oil is quite complicated, and the\r\nsorcerers are likely to have trouble operating her until they figure out\r\nthe system. If we reach them before they have time to master the thing,\r\nthey will be helpless to stop us!”\r\n\r\nThe young man’s enthusiasm was contagious. Dr. Gresham begun to give heed.\r\n\r\n“Even if we fail to get away in the _Nippon_,” the scientist admitted,\r\n“she has a powerful wireless outfit: Kwo-Sung-tao has been using it\r\nto communicate with Washington. With that radio in our hands for ten\r\nminutes, we can summon help sufficient to annihilate these yellow devils!”\r\n\r\nThe plan was adopted without further question. And, believing that the\r\nsorcerers’ easy victory over the _Albatross_ had made them careless,\r\nperhaps, we struck out in as direct a course as possible for the spot at\r\nwhich the _Nippon_ was docked.\r\n\r\nIn twenty minutes, without sighting any of the enemy, we arrived at the\r\nedge of the timber behind the wharf.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER X_\r\n\r\nWE TAKE DESPERATE CHANCES\r\n\r\nThe great liner lay silent in the moonlight, with no lights visible about\r\nher, but thin columns of smoke rose lazily from her funnels. A gangplank\r\nwas down.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that our number should divide into three equal parts. One\r\nwas to go to the bow and board the craft there by climbing up the line\r\nfastening the ship to the pier; this line was in the shadow except at its\r\nfar end, where the men would emerge upon the deck. The second group was\r\nto get aboard at the stern by the same means. And the third detachment\r\nwas to advance by the gangplank.\r\n\r\nThe plan worked without a hitch, and soon we were assembled upon the\r\nvessel’s main deck. No guard was in sight. Hurriedly, we explored the\r\nupper decks and all the chambers off them. They were empty.\r\n\r\nThen, descending simultaneously by companionways forward, aft and\r\namidship, we began to search the body of the vessel. Still no one could\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nAnd this deserted condition of the ship continued until only the\r\nstokehold remained to be entered. Here, however, we were certain of\r\nfinding people.\r\n\r\nLeaving three men on deck to guard against surprise, the rest of us crept\r\ninto the boiler room.\r\n\r\nOnly two Chinamen were in the place, leisurely engaged in stoking the\r\nfurnaces. We had them covered with our revolvers before they had any\r\nwarning of our approach.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the odds against them, one of the Mongolians leaped forward\r\nand had almost struck one of our men with his shovel before a shot killed\r\nhim in his tracks. The other Chinaman submitted, and he at once was\r\nsecurely bound and dumped into a corner.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham tried to question the prisoner in Chinese, but all the\r\ninformation he could get regarding the keeping up of steam on the\r\n_Nippon_ was: “Maybe leave here soon!”\r\n\r\nWhile the astronomer had been thus engaged, Ensign Hallock and some of\r\nhis men were examining the coal bunkers, and they now reported that the\r\nvessel was stocked with fuel for a long voyage.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, one of the deck watch came to announce that the moon\r\nwas sinking near the mountaintops, and that if we hoped to get far down\r\nthe channel before the light failed we would have to start promptly.\r\n\r\nDetailing eighteen men to do the firing—with orders to get more steam\r\nas rapidly as possible—Ensign Hallock and the rest rushed to the engine\r\nroom, where the three apprentice engineers already were at work. Finding\r\neverything all right there, the officer proceeded to the steering room,\r\nwhile some of us pulled in the gangplank.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer and myself next started to find the radio plant, to\r\nget into communication with the Mare Island navy yard. But here\r\nwe encountered a set-back: The wireless plant had been removed!\r\nKwo-Sung-tao, we could only surmise, had moved the set to a spot more\r\nconvenient to the village. So, for the present, communication with the\r\noutside world was impossible.\r\n\r\nDuring this brief period of putting the ship in sailing order, none of\r\nthe sorcerers made an appearance; probably all the men they could spare\r\nwere exploring the captured destroyer.\r\n\r\nSoon steam was up; whereupon Ensign Hallock sent Dr. Gresham to the bow\r\nand myself to the stern to keep a close lookout, and himself ascended to\r\nthe bridge and gave the order to start the engines and cast off. Before\r\nmany moments the leviathan was moving away from the wharf.\r\n\r\nThe officer had found from the charts that there was a place only half a\r\nmile or so upstream where the fiord opened into a bay, or amphitheater.\r\nThere, from all indications, room might be had to turn the ship around\r\nand head her down the channel. For this opening he now set his course.\r\n\r\nAlthough we maintained a very slow speed, it was not long before we\r\nnosed our way into the bay. Here the walls of the fiord retreated far\r\nenough to form a considerable body of water; nevertheless, it was plain\r\nwe would have close work turning the _Nippon_ in such a space. It would\r\nbe necessary to steam well over against the north bank, where there no\r\nlonger was any moonlight and the shore line was swallowed up in inky\r\nblackness.\r\n\r\nRedoubling the vigilance of our lookout, we began the maneuver. Slowly,\r\nEnsign Hallock swung the huge ship around. Twice it was necessary to stop\r\nand reverse the engines, accomplishing part of the turn by backing. In\r\ndoing so, we had a narrow escape from running into a rocky promontory in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nBut at last the liner’s head was fairly about and the way seemed clear\r\nfor our dash down the channel past the _Albatross_. As the officer\r\nsignaled for more speed, all of us unconsciously steeled ourselves for\r\nthe climax of our adventure.\r\n\r\nBut at that instant a deep-toned bell, sounding like the tocsin upon the\r\nTemple of the Moon God, began tolling in the distance. This was followed\r\nalmost immediately by a series of sharp blasts from the whistle of the\r\ndestroyer.\r\n\r\nNow that we had completed the dangerous turn, my duties in the stern were\r\nfinished, so I ran forward, joining Dr. Gresham, and together we climbed\r\nto the bridge.\r\n\r\n“The Chinks must have discovered that their ship is gone!” was the\r\ngreeting the young officer gave us.\r\n\r\nHe was hardly able to restrain his excitement; the prospect of a brush\r\nwith the sorcerers seemed to give him great joy.\r\n\r\nThe steam chant and the tolling of the bell continued, as if intended for\r\na general alarm.\r\n\r\n“Must be getting their gang together!” the ensign remarked. “They’ll be\r\nlaying for us now, but we’ll give them a run for their money!”\r\n\r\nThe liner now was beginning to get under considerable headway.\r\n\r\n“We’re in dangerous quarters until we get out of this stretch of\r\ndarkness!” the officer announced. “Here—you fellows each take a pair of\r\nglasses! You, doctor, keep watch from the starboard end of the bridge!\r\nYou”—indicating myself—“go to the port side! Watch like hawks!”\r\n\r\nWe started, but—the command had come too late!\r\n\r\nWith a dull, long-drawn ripping sound from her interior, the great liner\r\nsuddenly staggered and listed heavily to port! We were thrown off our\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n“_Struck a rock!_” Ensign Hallock shouted, as he leaped up. And instantly\r\nhe began signaling frantically to stop the engines. Almost in the same\r\nbreath he yelled: “Go below—both of you—quick! See what damage has been\r\ndone!”\r\n\r\nAs we rushed down from the bridge we could tell from the _feel_ of things\r\nthat the vessel’s progress had come to a stop: the _Nippon_ was stuck\r\nfast!\r\n\r\nAt the head of the stairs leading to the boiler room we met the seamen,\r\nwho had been doing stoker duty, rushing up.\r\n\r\n“You can’t go down there!” they shouted. “The whole bottom’s torn out!”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we leaped past them and continued below. But near the\r\nbottom of the stairs we were brought up short. A few lights still were\r\nburning, and in their feeble rays we could see huge foaming torrents\r\npouring into the place. Already the floor was awash to a depth of two or\r\nthree feet, and before we could take our eyes from the sight the flood\r\nseemed to rise several inches! Any moment the boilers might explode!\r\n\r\nUp the steps we dashed madly.\r\n\r\nAs we reached the deck everyone was hurrying aft. We joined in the rush.\r\n\r\nThe tolling of the temple bell and the shrieking of the destroyer’s\r\nwhistle continued in the distance: the Seuen-H’sin was preparing to take\r\nup our pursuit!\r\n\r\nThen, before we could make another move, the vessel suddenly lurched\r\nbackward and listed heavily to starboard, with her stern rising high out\r\nof the water. Then she began to nose forward under the waves.\r\n\r\n_The Nippon was sinking!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XI_\r\n\r\nA WILD NIGHT’S WORK\r\n\r\n“Lower the boats!” yelled Ensign Hallock.\r\n\r\nThe coolness, readiness and energy of this young man in any emergency\r\nwere an inspiration.\r\n\r\nAll of us flew to obey the command, our number dividing between the two\r\nboats nearest the stern. The liner was sinking so fast that in a few\r\nmoments the boats would be afloat, anyway; nevertheless, we soon had our\r\ncraft in the water.\r\n\r\n“Take that canvas covering!” bawled the ensign. “We may need it for a\r\nsail!”\r\n\r\nA sailor dragged the canvas into the boat, and we pushed off from the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe other party had encountered trouble with the davit-blocks, which\r\noccasioned a slight delay, and Hallock was just getting his boat into the\r\nwater when—\r\n\r\nWith a terrific crash, the _Nippon’s_ boilers burst!\r\n\r\nThe huge craft broke in two amidship, the central portion of her decks\r\nleaping out of the water. The force of the explosion hurled Ensign\r\nHallock and his men—lifeboat and all—over the stern amid a hurricane of\r\ndébris, while our own craft was flung bottom-up with great violence,\r\nscattering us all about in the water.\r\n\r\nIn an incredibly brief time the _Nippon_ slipped from view under the\r\nwaves, the swiftness of her sinking causing a violent suction that swept\r\nus into a whirlpool filled with timbers, broken boats and wreckage of all\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\nSomething heavy struck me on the head and knocked me almost senseless,\r\nbut I clutched a floating object and hung on in a daze. Presently I heard\r\nvoices calling not far away and, swimming toward them, I found a couple\r\nof men clinging to the life-boat. Others quickly began to join us—among\r\nthem Dr. Gresham. Soon we had the boat righted and found it undamaged.\r\nSomeone picked up some oars.\r\n\r\nThen we began rowing about the scene of the wreck, shouting and keeping a\r\nlookout for other survivors. In this way we rescued seven more men—one of\r\nthe last of these being Ensign Hallock, who was dazed from a bad cut on\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, believing further search to be futile, we made our way to\r\nthe north bank of the fiord.\r\n\r\nThere now were only fifteen of us left—twelve men having perished in the\r\nexplosion. While we were roughly dressing the wounds of the injured,\r\nwe began to hear excited shouts in Chinese from the other side of the\r\nwater, but the width of the fiord here was such as to make the cries\r\nindistinct. As the voices did not draw nearer, we began to believe that\r\nthe sorcerers possessed no small boats in which to cross to the scene of\r\nthe wreck. This gave us a greater feeling of safety, since the only way\r\nthe sorcerers could get at us for the present was by swimming; and not\r\nenough of them were likely to try to constitute a serious menace.\r\n\r\nIn the distance the whistling and bell-ringing had now died out.\r\n\r\nHastily conferring upon what should be done, we decided to stick to the\r\nlifeboat and drop down the channel, hoping to get out of the country of\r\nthe Seuen-H’sin before daylight. This course seemed feasible, since the\r\nwhole north bank of the fiord—the side opposite the village—was now in\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nWe started at once, rowing along silently, close to the shore.\r\nOccasionally we heard voices on the south bank, but we made no closer\r\nacquaintance with the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the _Albatross_, we muffled our oarlocks with bits of\r\ncloth torn from our clothing, and took every precaution against making a\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nA few lights were burning upon the destroyer’s deck, but otherwise she\r\nseemed deserted; possibly the Seuen-H’sin believed we had perished in the\r\nblowing up of the _Nippon_, and that they had nothing more to fear from\r\nintruders.\r\n\r\nAll at once, as we began to drop below the vessel, Ensign Hallock gave\r\nan order to cease rowing. Drawing us close together so we could hear his\r\nwhispered words, he announced:\r\n\r\n“Boys, let’s try to recapture the _Albatross_!”\r\n\r\nThen, with repressed excitement, he unfolded a plan.\r\n\r\nTo our ears the ensign’s words sounded like a proposal of suicide; but\r\nthe situation was appallingly desperate, and the upshot of the matter\r\nwas that we decided to make the attempt.\r\n\r\n“Who is to go with you?” I asked Hallock.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men promptly volunteered, and the ensign selected a\r\nmuscular seaman named Jim Burns.\r\n\r\nAgreeing upon a signal that should inform us when to follow them, the\r\nofficer and his partner slipped off most of their clothing and, arming\r\nthemselves only with knives, swam away. In a few seconds they were lost\r\nfrom sight.\r\n\r\nFrom Hallock himself, afterward, I learned the story of their daring\r\nundertaking—although I am certain he greatly minimized the dangers they\r\nran.\r\n\r\nReaching the deep shadows beside the destroyer, Hallock and Burns swam\r\nforward to the anchor chain hanging from the bow. There they waited a\r\ntime, but, hearing not a sound from above, the officer climbed up the\r\nchain and looked over the edge of the deck. No one was in sight.\r\n\r\nHe signaled Burns to come after him. Then, clinging to the edge of the\r\ndeck, with their bodies dangling down the side of the hull, out of sight\r\nof anyone above, they worked their way, hand-over-hand, back to a point\r\nopposite the after companionway. Still none of the Chinamen was in\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe deck was lighted at this point and the rays of other electric\r\nlamps poured out of the open companionway; nevertheless, the men swung\r\nthemselves up, climbed the rail, and darted to the side of the deck\r\nhouse. Leaving Burns here, Hallock crept alone around the corner to the\r\ncompanionway.\r\n\r\nJust as he reached the open door he almost collided with a Chinaman\r\ncoming up the stairs!\r\n\r\nBoth were taken completely by surprise, but the ensign recovered\r\nquickest, and before there was time for an outcry he had the Mongolian by\r\nthe throat and was choking the life out of him.\r\n\r\nSoon the fellow crumpled limply upon the deck. Hallock drew his knife to\r\nfinish the business—but at that instant there came the sound of voices\r\napproaching along the deck.\r\n\r\nSeizing the unconscious Chinaman by the arms, Hallock dragged him swiftly\r\naround the corner of the deck house to where Burns was waiting.\r\n\r\nWould the approaching men enter the companionway and go below, or come\r\non back to the stern? In the latter case they were bound to discover the\r\nintruders.\r\n\r\nWith drawn knives, the two Americans stood ready; the success or failure\r\nof their whole enterprise depended upon the next few seconds.\r\n\r\nBut the Chinamen turned down the steps, and their voices soon died out in\r\nthe interior of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThus assured of safety again for the moment, Ensign Hallock ended the\r\ncareer of the Mongolian and dragged the body into the deeper shadows\r\nin the stern. Then the two men advanced together to the companionway.\r\nEverything appeared quiet below.\r\n\r\nDown the stairs they noiselessly crept. At the bottom they could faintly\r\nhear voices—seemingly many of them—somewhere forward, or else on the next\r\nlower level. But they did not hesitate. The officer indicated the door of\r\na compartment only a dozen feet away. They reached it and got inside.\r\n\r\nThe room had been converted, during this voyage, into a storeroom.\r\nAmong its miscellaneous contents was a quantity of tear bombs—grenades\r\nthat discharge a gas which makes the victim’s eyes water until he is\r\ntemporarily blinded and helpless. To obtain all these missiles they could\r\ncarry was the work of but a few seconds, after which the Americans dashed\r\nfor the steps and started to the deck.\r\n\r\nJust as they got halfway up, a couple of Chinamen appeared suddenly in\r\nthe passage below and caught sight of them. The Celestials uttered loud\r\nwarning cries and darted after the visitors.\r\n\r\nInstantly Seaman Burns, who was behind, hurled one of the bombs to the\r\nfloor at the foot of the ladder—and then another and another.\r\n\r\nThe sorcerers halted a moment, surprised by the missiles—and before they\r\ncould resume their rush they were blinded by tears. Screaming in rage and\r\ndismay, they retreated down the passage toward the other voices that were\r\nbeginning to respond to their cries.\r\n\r\nWith this, Burns ran on up to the deck.\r\n\r\n“Stay here and hold this stairway!” ordered Hallock. “I’ll go forward to\r\nthe other ladder! Don’t let any of them reach the deck!”\r\n\r\nAnd the officer ran off.\r\n\r\nHe reached the forward companionway just as half a dozen of the Chinamen\r\nwere crowding toward the foot of the stairs. A couple of the bombs hurled\r\namong them drove them back. Two more missiles followed; then Hallock\r\nslammed the door shut and fastened it.\r\n\r\nRunning to the rail, he signaled us to advance. In two or three minutes\r\nour rowboat was alongside and we were scrambling up the anchor chain.\r\n\r\nOn the main deck, under the bridge, formerly had been stored a number of\r\nrifles, and Hallock now ran to see if these were still there. Luckily\r\nthe Chinamen had not disturbed them, and the officer soon was back with a\r\nloaded weapon for each man.\r\n\r\n“The effect of the tear gas must be wearing off below,” he announced,\r\n“so we can go down now and clean up those devils! But confine all your\r\nshooting under decks, where it’s not so likely to be heard on shore!”\r\n\r\n“And,” interposed Dr. Gresham, “don’t show a spark of mercy, or we will\r\nbe certain to pay dearly for it later!”\r\n\r\nLeaving six men on deck to keep watch, the rest of us divided and went\r\ndown fore and aft. The gas still was strong, but no longer overpowering.\r\nThe Chinese, we found, had groped their way into the engine room. Here we\r\ncame upon them—forty-eight in all.\r\n\r\nUpon the scene of slaughter that followed I will draw the veil. Thus the\r\nSeuen-H’sin had slain our comrades—and we knew that, were our positions\r\nnow reversed, we would meet the same bloody end. Suffice it to say\r\nthat within fifteen minutes the last of the sorcerers’ bodies had been\r\ndisposed of overboard.\r\n\r\nOnce more we were masters of the _Albatross_!\r\n\r\nOur first move, we decided, would be to steam down the channel a few\r\nmiles, where the Mongolians could not immediately get at us. Fortunately,\r\ntwo of the apprentice engineers were among the survivors, and they\r\nundertook to handle the machinery.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Hallock and most of the crew went to work setting up\r\nrapid fire guns in convenient places to repel invasion, and storing\r\nammunition and hand grenades on deck. A couple of the larger guns\r\nlikewise were unlimbered, ready for action.\r\n\r\nBy the time these tasks were completed, steam had been gotten up, and the\r\nvessel began its retreat down the channel.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Dr. Gresham and myself hastened to the radio room to summon\r\naid from the Mare Island navy yard at San Francisco.\r\n\r\nBut barely had the astronomer placed the receivers to his ears and\r\nreached forward to adjust the apparatus, before a startling event\r\nforestalled his call.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XII_\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\nAt the precise instant when Dr. Gresham seated himself at the radio of\r\nthe _Albatross_, the great Consolidated News Syndicate, which dealt with\r\nnewspapers all over the world, was broadcasting a “flash” of terrible\r\nimport:\r\n\r\n_An hour ago New York had been wiped out by a stupendous tidal wave!_\r\n\r\nDetails of the disaster still were lacking.\r\n\r\nAnd then, before the astronomer could lift a hand to send his call, some\r\ninstantaneous and terrific disturbance of the atmosphere blotted out all\r\nwireless communication!\r\n\r\nWhat this disturbance might be, or what it might portend, seemed to\r\narouse in my companion the gravest alarm. His face looked ashen as he sat\r\nthere at the key. Over and over he sought to get Mare Island, but without\r\nsuccess: the ether was as unresponsive as if his instruments were dead.\r\n\r\nPresently he rose without a word and, motioning me to follow, sought\r\nEnsign Hallock on the bridge. Briefly he told the young officer about the\r\ndestruction of Manhattan, adding:\r\n\r\n“Something serious has happened somewhere in the world, since then,\r\ncompletely to disorder the atmosphere. It may be the earth’s final\r\nstruggle for existence. Unless the Seuen-H’sin’s power is broken _at\r\nonce_, the end is near! It is too late to wait for reinforcements. We\r\nmust tackle the job ourselves—at any cost! The question is: how are we\r\ngoing to do it?”\r\n\r\nHallock thought a few moments, and then replied:\r\n\r\n“We can’t bomb the place from an airplane, because we brought no airplane\r\nbombs. And we can’t shell it with the ship’s guns without knowing its\r\nexact location. Our planes aren’t equipped with range finders, either—so\r\nit would do no good to try to locate it from the air.\r\n\r\n“That,” he added with decision, “leaves us no choice but a direct attack!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” responded Dr. Gresham, “at any cost, we’ve got to try!”\r\n\r\nAt once we consulted the ship’s charts—and made a discovery.\r\n\r\nNot far below our present location, a tributary fiord entered Dean\r\nChannel from the left, and with sudden hope we saw that this waterway\r\ntwisted back among the mountains for several miles—reaching a point\r\nin one of its windings where it was not more than six or seven miles\r\ndirectly south of the region in which the power plant was hidden.\r\n\r\n“There’s our chance!” Hallock announced. “If the sorcerers have missed\r\nthe _Albatross_, they’ll think we are on our way out of the country as\r\nfast as we can travel. They won’t be expecting us to come back so soon—in\r\nbroad daylight. We can steam up this side channel to the proper spot and\r\nthen march across the mountains until we find the plant.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” assented the scientist. “They are less likely to be on guard\r\nagainst an attack from that side, anyway!”\r\n\r\nDay was now beginning to break, which made further navigation easy. In\r\na few minutes we came to the tributary inlet, and swung the vessel in\r\nbetween its high, constricted walls.\r\n\r\nThe ensign was now imbued with marvelous activity. Orders flew thick and\r\nfast. A couple of the machine guns were made ready for land transport.\r\nTwo light mountain mortars and a quantity of ammunition were brought up\r\non deck. A supply of shrapnel hand grenades was distributed among the men.\r\n\r\nOur progress through this tortuous waterway necessarily was slow;\r\nnevertheless, at the end of an hour and a half, the destroyer was stopped\r\nand we made ready for the final adventure.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that all fifteen of us should go, because less than that\r\nnumber could not carry our equipment up and down the steep mountainsides,\r\nand three or four men left to guard the ship would be utterly useless in\r\nthe event of an attack.\r\n\r\nSo, with every nerve alert, we struck out through the trackless\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThree hours later we came upon six large steel conduits which we knew\r\nmust convey the water power to the plant, and in a few minutes we had\r\nfollowed these to our goal.\r\n\r\nHere we found ourselves upon the brow of a promontory directly behind and\r\nfully 300 feet above the Seuen-H’sin’s workshop. The promontory ended in\r\na sheer precipice, from the outermost curve of which the conduits dropped\r\nstraight down into the powerhouse. This tremendous fall of the six\r\nstreams of water supplied the enormous energy to the turbines. The summit\r\nof this projecting ridge was fairly level, and for a distance of perhaps\r\nseventy-five yards at the end the timber had been entirely cleared away.\r\n\r\nExtending out from the brow of the precipice, and resting upon the tops\r\nof the conduits where they plunged downward, was a narrow bridge of iron\r\nlattice-work which connected all six of the pipes and gave access to the\r\nbolts which tightened the steel elbows. Through holes in this grating,\r\niron ladders fastened between the pipes and the granite cliff back of\r\nthem descended clear to the bottom of the precipice.\r\n\r\nA slight rail only three feet high protected the outer edge of this\r\ngrid—a little hand-hold for the workmen in case of a misstep. From this\r\ndizzy balcony it would be possible to drop a stone almost upon the roof\r\nof the powerhouse.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick look around, Ensign Hallock chose a spot a little back from\r\nthe cliff to set up the mortars that were to throw explosives upon the\r\nbuilding. He also prepared to place mines under the conduits. But first\r\nthe machine guns were planted to command the surrounding timber, in case\r\nof an attack.\r\n\r\nThere still was no indication that the sorcerers suspected our presence\r\nin their vicinity; so, inasmuch as Hallock said his preparations would\r\ntake some little time, Dr. Gresham determined to employ the interval in\r\ngetting a closer look at the power plant.\r\n\r\nOne of the ladders down the precipice, he had noticed, was in such\r\na position behind its water main that it could not be seen from the\r\nbuilding; and he decided to attempt the approach by this means. To my\r\ndelight, he made no objection to my accompanying him.\r\n\r\nAs we slipped through an opening in the iron bridge and started our dizzy\r\ndescent of the ladder—which seemed to sway beneath our weight—I felt a\r\nthrill of exultation, in spite of our peril, at the thought that at last\r\nwe were to solve the mystery of the Seuen-H’sin’s terrible power over our\r\nplanet!\r\n\r\nThe trip was slow and risky, but finally we came abreast of a window in\r\nthe rear wall of the building, and by stretching around the side of the\r\nthick water main we could see into the place.\r\n\r\nThe workshop of the sorcerers was a long, low, narrow structure directly\r\nbeside the river. Like the houses back in the Chinese village, it was a\r\nmere shell of corrugated iron, its steel framework so bolted together\r\nthat it could sway with the earth tremors.\r\n\r\nIn a row down the centre of the structure were six huge turbines,\r\noperating electric generators.\r\n\r\nAlong one side of the room was the largest switchboard I had ever seen,\r\nwhile the whole of the other lengthwise wall was flanked with a series of\r\nmassive induction coils, elaborately insulated from each other and from\r\nthe ground. Although I knew little about electricity, I was certain that\r\nif the combined electrical output of those dynamos were directed through\r\nthat maze of coils, the resulting voltage could only be measured in the\r\nmillions—perhaps hundreds of millions!\r\n\r\nFrom one large, enclosed object, supported on steel uprights over the\r\nrow of induction coils, two electric cables, more than two inches in\r\ndiameter, ran off through the north end of the building. One of these\r\nended in a tiny structure about eighty yards from the powerhouse. The\r\nother ran on up the valley.\r\n\r\nBut, most curious of all, in the center of the switchboards was an\r\napparatus surmounted by a large clock, before which a Chinese attendant\r\nsat constantly. Precisely every eleven minutes and six seconds a bell on\r\nthis clock clanged sharply, and there was a bright flash in a long glass\r\ntube, followed by an earth shock.\r\n\r\nFor some time we clung there in the shadows, while Dr. Gresham studied\r\nevery detail of the amazing workshop. Then, calling my attention to the\r\nfact that the place outside the powerhouse, where one of the cables\r\nended, was hidden from view of the attendants inside by a thick clump of\r\ntrees, the astronomer said he wanted a closer look at this place.\r\n\r\nCreeping through the timber, we reached the tiny structure over the\r\ncable’s end. Not the slightest watch seemed to be kept anywhere about the\r\nplant. The door to the house was not fastened, so we entered and looked\r\nhurriedly about.\r\n\r\nThe room was absolutely empty except for the heavy cable, which came to\r\nthe center of the floor and there connected with a copper post about four\r\ninches in diameter that ran straight down into the ground.\r\n\r\nWithout lingering further, we crawled back to the ladder and commenced\r\nour long climb up the cliff.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the top again, we found the ensign and his men still busy\r\nwith their preparations for the bombardment. Withdrawing far enough to be\r\nout of their hearing, the astronomer turned to me and remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you think of the scientific achievements of the sorcerers\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to think!” I replied. “It’s utterly beyond my\r\ncomprehension!”\r\n\r\nThe doctor chuckled at my dismay.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me,” he said, “for having kept you so long in the dark.\r\nUntil today I could never prove my theories—certain as I was of their\r\ncorrectness—and I did not wish to attempt any explanations until I\r\nwas sure of my ground. But now you have seen enough to understand the\r\nsolution of the puzzle.”\r\n\r\nTo my delight, the scientist was dropping into one of his most\r\ncommunicative moods. After a moment he went on:\r\n\r\n“To comprehend, even in a general way, what the Seuen-H’sin has done, you\r\nmust understand the principle of resonance.\r\n\r\n“Let us start with the swinging pendulum of a clock. What keeps it in\r\nmotion? Nothing but a slight push, delivered at exactly the right time.\r\nAny swinging object can be kept swinging, even though it weigh many\r\ntons, if it is given a touch by the finger of a baby at _just the right\r\nmoment_. By the same principle, the amount of swing can be increased\r\nenormously if the successive pushes are correctly timed.\r\n\r\n“But we need not limit our illustration to swinging objects. Everything\r\nin the word has a natural period of vibration, whether it be a violin\r\nstring, or a battleship, or a forty-story skyscraper.\r\n\r\n“Fifty men can capsize a twenty-thousand-ton battleship merely by running\r\nback and forth from one side of the deck to the other and carefully\r\ntiming their trips to the vessel’s rolling. A child with a tack hammer\r\ncan shake down a forty-story skyscraper if he can discover the natural\r\nperiod of the building’s vibration and then tap persistently upon the\r\nsteel framework at the correct interval.\r\n\r\n“Even the earth itself has its natural period of vibration.\r\n\r\n“If you exploded a ton of dynamite on top of the ground it would blow\r\nquite a hole and jar the earth for several miles around it; and that\r\nwould be all. But if you set off another ton of dynamite, and then\r\nanother and another, and kept it up continuously—always timing the\r\nexplosions to the period of the earth’s vibration—eventually the jar\r\nwould be felt clear through the globe. And if you still persisted, in\r\ntime you would wreck the world.\r\n\r\n“Such is the accumulative power of many little blows correctly timed.\r\nThe principle of timing small impulses to produce large effects is the\r\nprinciple of resonance.\r\n\r\n“But there are other forces in nature which can produce\r\nvibration—electricity, for instance, Nikola Tesla demonstrated a number\r\nof years ago that the globe is resonant to electric waves.\r\n\r\n“Now, suppose some person constructed an apparatus that could suddenly\r\nturn a tremendous flood of electric waves into the earth. That energy\r\nwould go clear through the globe, imparting a tiny impulse to every atom\r\nof matter of which the sphere is composed—like a push upon the pendulum\r\nof a clock.\r\n\r\n“And suppose that person knew the exact period of the earth’s vibration,\r\nand sent another bolt, and another and another, into the globe—all\r\nexactly timed to impart a fresh impulse at the correct moment—to give\r\nthe pendulum another push, so to speak. Then let him pile electric\r\nimpulse upon electric impulse, each at just the right second, until the\r\naccumulation of them all represented millions of horsepower in electric\r\noscillations. In time, _the world would be shaken to pieces_!\r\n\r\n“And—impossible as it sounds—that is the very principle the Seuen-H’sin\r\nis using there beneath your eyes! The dynamos furnish the power, and that\r\ngreat battery of induction coils magnifies it to an almost inconceivable\r\nvoltage. By those cables attached to copper plugs, the impulses are\r\nconveyed to the earth.\r\n\r\n“Every blow of that tremendous electric hammer is heavier than the\r\npreceding one because it has the accumulated power of all the others\r\nbehind it. With every blow the earth grows weaker—less able to stand the\r\nshock. Continued, the planet’s doom would be inevitable—if it is not\r\nalready so!”\r\n\r\nI had been listening to this recital with amazement too profound to admit\r\nof interruption. When Dr. Gresham finished I sat silent, turning it\r\nall over in my mind, and reflecting how simple the explanation seemed.\r\nFinally—\r\n\r\n“Was it those electric waves being discharged into the ground,” I asked,\r\n“that Professor Howard Whiteman in Washington mistook for wireless\r\nsignals from Mars?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely!” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“And how,” I inquired, “was it possible for the sorcerers to discover\r\nthe exact period of the earth’s vibration? That seems little short of\r\nsuperhuman.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless you remember the newspaper accounts published that night\r\nwhen we returned from Labrador,” replied the doctor. “They told how the\r\nelectric whispers, when first noticed, occurred exactly two minutes\r\napart; then the interval increased one minute each night until the\r\nsignals were separated by more than thirty minutes; afterward the lulls\r\naltered erratically for some time, until they became fixed at eleven\r\nminutes and six seconds.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I assented.\r\n\r\n“Well,” continued the scientist, “those variations simply denoted the\r\nexperiment of the Seuen-H’sin to ascertain the period of the globe’s\r\nvibration. If, after continuing their discharges all one night, their\r\nseismographs showed no response from the earth, they knew their bolts\r\nwere wrongly timed, and they experimented with another period.\r\n\r\n“Eventually they found that their impulses penetrated the earth with a\r\nspeed of approximately 709 miles a minute—in other words, in precisely\r\neleven minutes and six seconds the waves passed clear through the\r\nplant. This, then, was demonstrated to be the length of time that must\r\nelapse before the pendulum—figuratively speaking—could be given another\r\nelectrical push. You saw just now, on the switchboard down there, the\r\nclockwork apparatus which times those bolts.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s consideration I remarked:\r\n\r\n“Your own electrical equipment on board the _Albatross_—those big\r\ninduction coils and the rest of it—what did you plan to do with that?”\r\n\r\n“I had meant to fight the Seuen-H’sin with its own methods,” the\r\ndoctor replied. “I was going to throw a high-power electric current\r\ninto the earth at intervals between those of the sorcerers’—say five\r\nminutes apart. That would have interfered with the acceleration of the\r\nvibrations—like setting a second group of men to run across the ship’s\r\ndeck between the trips of the first group. One set of vibrations would\r\nhave neutralized the other.\r\n\r\n“But,” Dr. Gresham added, “the time for such methods is past. We must end\r\nthe whole thing immediately—at one stroke!”\r\n\r\nReceiving a signal from Ensign Hallock that he was ready, we started to\r\nrejoin the ship’s party. But before we had gone a dozen steps we were\r\nrooted to the spot by a new terror!\r\n\r\nOff in the east, where the snow-covered peaks lifted into the sky,\r\nsuddenly burst forth an awful crashing sound, as of a colossal\r\ncannonade—a ponderous and unbroken thunder-roll, terrible as the enormous\r\ntumult of the day of doom. As our gaze followed the nightmare sounds to\r\nthe edge of the world we beheld the lofty mountains oscillate, crack,\r\ndisjoint, and crumble into seething ruin.\r\n\r\nThe noise that accompanied this destruction came roaring and booming\r\nacross the intervening miles—a stupendous and unearthly commotion,\r\nshattering the very atmosphere to fragments.\r\n\r\nFor a minute Dr. Gresham stood petrified. But as the enormity of the\r\ncataclysm became evident, an unconscious cry, almost a groan, escaped him:\r\n\r\n“Too late! Too late! The beginning of the end!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he wheeled—almost livid with excitement—to the naval officer and\r\nscreamed at the lop of his voice:\r\n\r\n“_Fire!_ For God’s sake destroy that power plant! _Fire! FIRE!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIII_\r\n\r\nPLAYING OUR FINAL CARD\r\n\r\nIn their astonishment at the terrible upheaval, Ensign Hallock and his\r\nmen had left their posts and crowded toward the end of the promontory, a\r\nfew feet away from the mortars. At Dr. Gresham’s command to fire, most of\r\nthem leaped to obey the order.\r\n\r\nInstantly the woods behind us sprang into life as a horde of Chinamen\r\ndashed from cover, charging straight at us!\r\n\r\nFrom the size of the attacking force, it was evident our presence had\r\nbeen known for some time and our capture delayed until a sufficient\r\nnumber of the sorcerers could be assembled to insure our defeat: there\r\nseemed to be scores of the blue-clad figures. Most of them were armed\r\nwith rifles, although some had only knives and a few iron bars which they\r\nwielded as clubs.\r\n\r\nThe distance across the clearing was not much more than 200 feet, and the\r\nChinamen advanced at a run—without any outcry.\r\n\r\nBut before they had traversed a quarter of the space Ensign Hallock\r\nrecovered from his surprise and, with a few terse commands, led his crew\r\ninto action. Dashing to the machine guns, the seamen threw themselves\r\nflat on the ground; and while some manned these weapons, the rest\r\nresorted to their revolvers. In two or three seconds the booming of the\r\ndistant cataclysm was augmented by a steady volley of firing.\r\n\r\nWith deadly effect the machine guns raked the advancing semi-circle of\r\nMongolians. As the foremost line began suddenly to melt away, the rest\r\nof the sorcerers wavered and presently came to a halt. They now were not\r\nmore than a hundred feet from us. At a command, they all dropped down\r\nupon the ground, the ones with rifles in front, and began to return our\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nI had drawn my revolver and joined in the fight—and so had Dr. Gresham\r\nbeside me. But in our excitement we had remained on our feet, and I now\r\nheard the astronomer shouting at me:\r\n\r\n“Lie down! _Lie down!_”\r\n\r\nEven as I dropped, my hat was knocked off by a bullet; but, unharmed, I\r\nstretched out and continued shooting.\r\n\r\nPausing to slip a fresh magazine of cartridges into my automatic, I\r\nsuddenly became aware that a vast wind was starting to blow out of the\r\neast; the very air seemed alive and quivering.\r\n\r\nThe Chinamen still outnumbered us heavily, and all at once I\r\nrealized—chiefly from the lessening of our fire—that their rifle attack\r\nwas beginning to take effect. Glancing about, I saw five or six of the\r\nseamen lying motionless.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture one of the machine guns jammed, and while its crew was\r\ntrying to fix it the yellow devils took toll of several more of our men.\r\nI now saw that only six of us were left to fight.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously I became half conscious of a strange, mysterious something\r\ngoing on about us—a subtle, ghostly change, not on the earth itself, but\r\nin the air above—some throbbing, indefinable suggestion of impending\r\ndoom—of the end of things.\r\n\r\nSnatching a glance over my shoulder, I saw arising upon the eastern\r\nhorizon a black, monstrous cloud of appalling aspect—a spuming billow of\r\nsable mist—twisting, flying, lifting into the heavens with tremendous\r\nspeed. And each moment the wind was growing mere violent.\r\n\r\nWas this, after all, to be the finish? Was the world—the white man’s\r\nworld, which we had fought so hard to save—to go to smash through these\r\nyellow devils’ fiendishness? Having come within actual sight of the\r\nmachinery that was the cause of it all, was our task to remain unfinished?\r\n\r\nWith a terrible cold fury clutching at my heart, I crawled quickly\r\nforward, discharging my revolver steadily as I went, to lend a hand with\r\nthe disabled machine gun.\r\n\r\nBut as I reached it Ensign Hallock dropped the weapon, with a gesture of\r\nuselessness, and moved quickly back to the mortars. Out of the corner\r\nof my eye I saw him trying to fire the things, and a wave of fierce joy\r\nseized me.\r\n\r\nBut the task caused the naval officer to half raise himself from the\r\nground, and as he did so I saw him clutch at a bleeding gash on his head\r\nand fall forward, where he lay still.\r\n\r\nAn instant later the Chinamen leaped to their feet with a loud cry\r\nand charged upon us. They, too, were greatly reduced in numbers, but\r\nthere were only four of us now, so nothing remained but an attempt at\r\nretreat. As we did so we began hurling our hand grenades, all the while\r\nmoving slowly in the only direction we could go—toward the brink of the\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, above the crack of the rifles and the exploding of the\r\ngrenades, an enormous roaring burst forth in the east—a sinister\r\nscreaming of immeasurable forces, moaning, hooting, shrieking across the\r\nworld—the weird, awful voice of the wounded planet’s stupendous agony.\r\n\r\nThis new terror attracted so much attention that there was a momentary\r\npause in the sorcerers’ onslaught, and in that brief lull I noted that\r\nour grenades had wrought terrible havoc among the Chinamen, reducing\r\ntheir number to a mere handful. Dr. Gresham saw this at the same time,\r\nand shouted to us to let them have it again with the missiles.\r\n\r\nApparently sensing the purport of this command, the Chinamen sprang\r\nforward, seeking to engage us at too close range for the grenades to be\r\nused. But several of the missiles met them almost at their first leap,\r\nand when the hurricane of shrapnel abated, there remained only three of\r\nthe yellow fiends to continue the attack.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time I made the grim discovery that on our side Dr.\r\nGresham and myself alone survived!\r\n\r\nWith the realization that it had now come to a hand-to-hand encounter,\r\nI braced myself to meet the shock as the trio darted forward. I somehow\r\nfelt that nothing mattered any longer, anyway, for so tremendous had\r\nbecome the earth-tumult that it seemed impossible the planet could resist\r\ndisruption many minutes more.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the passions of a wild animal surged within me; a sort of\r\nmadness steeled my muscles.\r\n\r\nOne powerful, thick-set Chinaman leaped upon Dr. Gresham and the two\r\nwent down in a striking, clawing test of strength. A second later the\r\nremaining pair hurled themselves upon me.\r\n\r\nI whipped out my revolver just as one fellow seized me from the front,\r\nand, pressing the weapon against his body, I fired. In a moment he\r\nrelaxed his hold and crumpled down at my feet. The other chap now had me\r\naround the neck from the rear and was shutting off my wind. Round and\r\nround we staggered, as I vainly sought to loosen his hold. Before long\r\neverything went black in front of me and I thought I was done for—when I\r\nheard faintly, in a daze, the crack of a revolver. Quickly the grip about\r\nmy neck fell away.\r\n\r\nWhen I began to come to myself again I saw Ensign Hallock sitting up on\r\nthe ground, his face covered with blood, but wielding the revolver that\r\nhad ended the career of my last adversary.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I saw that the officer was trying desperately to train\r\nhis weapon upon something behind me. Looking about, I saw Dr. Gresham and\r\nhis opponent rolling over and over on the ground, almost at the edge of\r\nthe precipice, struggling frantically for possession of a knife. Because\r\nof their rapid changes of position, Hallock dared not shoot, for fear of\r\nhitting the scientist.\r\n\r\nJust then the Chinaman came on top for an instant, and I leaped forward,\r\naiming my revolver at him. The trigger snapped, but there was no report.\r\nThe weapon was empty.\r\n\r\nLess than a dozen feet now separated me from the wrestlers, when the\r\nCelestial suddenly jerked the knife free and raised it for a swift stroke.\r\n\r\nWith all my strength I hurled the empty revolver at the yellow devil. It\r\nstruck him squarely between the eyes. The knife dropped and he clutched\r\nat his face, at the same time struggling to his feet to meet the new\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nFreed from the struggle, Dr. Gresham’s figure relaxed as in a swoon.\r\n\r\nInstantly I was after the Chinaman—without a thought of his bull-like\r\nstrength. I was seeing red. The furious joy of the primeval man\r\nhunter—the lust for blood—turned my head. My one idea was to kill.\r\n\r\nLeaping over the prostrate scientist, I flung myself at the last of the\r\nsorcerers. He had retreated three or four feet, and now stood at bay upon\r\nthe iron bridge that ran along the top of the water mains, overhanging\r\nthe precipice. As I dashed at him he stepped quickly aside. I missed\r\nhim—and my heart leaped into my throat as I stumbled across the perilous\r\neyrie and brought up against the outer rail, which seemed to sway.\r\n\r\nI staggered, seized the rod, and saved myself. Far, far below, jagged\r\nrocks and the roof of the Seuen-H’sin’s powerhouse greeted my gaze.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time—although I was not conscious of paying attention\r\nto it—I became sensible of the fact that the monstrous cloud above the\r\nhorizon was soaring swiftly, beating its black wings close to the sun—and\r\nthat a weird twilight, a ghostly gloom, was settling over everything.\r\nFrom the distance, too, still came that appalling uproar.\r\n\r\nAs I recovered my balance the Chinaman bounded at me. But his foot caught\r\nin the grating and he stumbled to his knees. Instantly I threw myself\r\nupon him. My knee bored into the small of his back; my fingers sank into\r\nhis throat. _I had him!_ If I could keep my hold a little while the life\r\nwould be strangled from his body.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his disadvantage, the fellow staggered to his feet. And there\r\nabove the void—upon that narrow steel framework, protected only by its\r\nleg-high rail—we began a life-and-death struggle.\r\n\r\nI hung on, like a mountain lion upon the back of its prey, while the\r\nChinaman lurched and twisted this way and that.\r\n\r\nOnce he staggered against the railing, lost his footing, swung around—and\r\nI hung out over empty space, a drop of fully 300 feet. I thought the end\r\nhad come—that we would topple off into the void. But his mighty strength\r\npulled us back upon the grating—the whole slight structure seeming to\r\nsway and creak as he did so.\r\n\r\nI tightened my grip upon his throat, digging my fingers into his\r\nwindpipe, until I felt the life ebbing out of him in a steady flow. My\r\nown strength was almost gone, but the primitive desire to kill kept me\r\nclinging there tenaciously.\r\n\r\nAt last he began to weaken. In his death throes he lurched about in\r\na circle—until his foot slipped through a man-hole above one of the\r\nladders, and he fell across the rail with a choking moan. With me hanging\r\nupon his back he began to slip outward and downward, inch by inch.\r\n\r\nI knew the end had come. He was falling—and I was falling with him.\r\nBut thoughts of my own death were smothered in a wild rejoicing. I had\r\nconquered this yellow fiend! Everything grew blurred before my eyes as we\r\nsagged toward the final plunge into the gorge.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my ankles were seized in a stout grip, and I felt myself being\r\ndragged back from the sickening void. With this, I loosened my hold upon\r\nthe Chinaman’s throat, and his body went hurtling past me to its doom.\r\n\r\nAnother instant and I was off the rocking bridge, upon solid ground, and\r\nDr. Ferdinand Gresham was shaking me in an effort to restore my senses.\r\n\r\nHe had recovered from his own fainting spell just in time to save me from\r\nbeing dragged over the cliff.\r\n\r\nSwiftly I drew myself together. The weird twilight was deepening. But\r\na few feet away I beheld Ensign Hallock busy at the mortars and mines,\r\npreparing to touch them off.\r\n\r\nHe motioned to us to run. We did so. In a moment his work was finished\r\nand he took after us.\r\n\r\nBack along the ridge we fled, away from the danger of the coming blast.\r\n\r\nA couple of hundred yards distant, and about fifty feet below us, a bare\r\npromontory jutted out from the hillside, affording an unobstructed view\r\nof the whole region—the crumbling mountains upon the horizon, the power\r\nplant at the base of the cliff, and the bare space behind us where the\r\nmines were about to end the career of the sorcerers’ workshop.\r\n\r\nWe started to descend to this plateau—when suddenly I dragged my\r\ncompanions back and pointed excitedly below, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“_Look! Look!_”\r\n\r\nThere in the center of the promontory, seemingly all alone, stood\r\nthe arch fiend of all this havoc—the high priest of the sorcerers,\r\nKwo-Sung-tao!\r\n\r\nApparently the old fellow had chosen this spot whence he could view in\r\nsafety his followers’ attack upon our party. He had not heard my outcry\r\nbehind him, and remained absorbed in the Titanic upheaval of the distant\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAs I looked down upon his shriveled figure, a wave of savage joy swept\r\nover me! At last fate was strangely playing into our hands! Quite\r\nunsuspecting, the most menacing figure of the ages—the master mind of\r\ndiabolical achievement, the would-be “dictator of human destiny”—had been\r\ncast into our net for final vengeance!\r\n\r\nJust then the mortars boomed, and two charges of high explosives went\r\nhurtling toward the roof of the powerhouse.\r\n\r\nKwo-Sung-tao wheeled and stared off toward the opposite promontory.\r\nSeeing nothing, he hesitated in alarm. He did not look around in our\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAnother instant and the explosives fell squarely upon the roof of the\r\nbuilding, and with two frightful detonations—so close together that they\r\nseemed almost as one—the whole structure burst asunder vanished in a\r\nflying tornado of débris. For a few moments nothing was visible save a\r\ntremendous geyser of dirt, steel, concrete and bits of machinery.\r\n\r\nWhile the air was filled with this gust of wreckage, my gaze sped back to\r\nthe leader of the Seuen-H’sin.\r\n\r\nThe old man stood stock still, petrified by this sudden destruction of\r\nall his hopes and work. What agony of soul he was enduring in that moment\r\nI could only guess. His mummified figure suddenly to have shriveled\r\nunbelievably—to be actually withering before our eyes!\r\n\r\nJust then the mines under the water mains went off, ripping the conduits\r\nto tatters—and the immense hydraulic force, suddenly released, roared\r\ndown the precipice, tearing the ground at the bottom of the gorge away to\r\nthe foundation rock and obliterating the last scrap of wreckage!\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment Dr. Gresham left us and plunged down the\r\nslope toward the high priest, as if to settle the score with him alone.\r\nRecovering from our surprise, we followed rapidly.\r\n\r\nApparently sensing the danger, Kwo-Sung-tao suddenly glanced around. As\r\nhe beheld Dr. Gresham he pulled himself together and I saw a look of\r\nmalignity come over his face such as I never before nor since have seen\r\nupon a human countenance! It was as if he sought to blast his enemy with\r\na glance!\r\n\r\nThe demoniacal fury of that gaze actually caused the astronomer to\r\nslacken his rush.\r\n\r\nPromptly the old sorcerer’s hand darted beneath his robe and came out\r\nwith a revolver. But before the weapon could be aimed I had snatched\r\na hand grenade and hurled at the Chinaman. The missile flew over him,\r\nexploding some feet away; but a bit of its metal must have hit the old\r\nfellow, inflicting a serious wound, for he dropped the revolver and\r\nclutched at his side.\r\n\r\nAs he did so he turned his eyes upon me—and the blood seemed to freeze\r\nwithin my veins! Not to my dying day shall I forget the awful power of\r\nthat look!\r\n\r\nBut only for a second did this last—for I had already drawn another\r\ngrenade and was in the act of hurling it. This time the bomb fell\r\ndirectly at the feet of the high priest and burst with deadly force.\r\n\r\nEven while the old man’s eyes were boring through me with that unearthly\r\nfury, Kwo-Sung-tao was blown to fragments!\r\n\r\nAn instant later the sun vanished, and a ghostly semi-night fell like a\r\nthunderbolt!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was several days later when Dr. Ferdinand Gresham, Ensign Hallock and\r\nmyself returned to the Mare Island navy yard at San Francisco.\r\n\r\nAnd there, for the first time, we learned that the world remained intact\r\nand was out of danger.\r\n\r\nWhen we had ascertained that we three were the only survivors of our\r\nexpedition, we had started wandering over the mountains through the\r\nsemi-darkness until we found the destroyer. Unable to navigate the\r\nvessel, we had taken the hydroplane, which Hallock knew how to handle,\r\nand started south. Engine trouble had prolonged our trip.\r\n\r\nBack from the grave, as it seemed, we listened with tremendous elation to\r\nthe story of the wounded planet’s convalescence.\r\n\r\nThat last terrible upheaval, just before the destruction of the\r\nsorcerers’ power plant, had seemed for a time to be the actual beginning\r\nof the end. But, instead, it had proved to be the climax—after which the\r\nearthquakes had begun rapidly to die out. Scientists now declared that\r\nbefore long the earth would regain its normal stability.\r\n\r\nWith our return, the story of the Seuen-H’sin was given to the public.\r\nSo universal became the horror with which that sect was regarded that an\r\ninternational expedition proceeded into China and dealt vigorously with\r\nthe sorcerers.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous changes that had been wrought in the surface of the planet\r\npresently lost their novelty.\r\n\r\nAnd New York and other cities that had been destroyed, or partially so,\r\nspeedily were rebuilt.\r\n\r\nHere I must not omit one other strange incident connected with these\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nOne evening, nearly two years after our encounter with the sorcerers,\r\nDr. Gresham and I were sitting at the window of his New York apartment,\r\nidly watching the moon rise above the range of housetops to the east of\r\nCentral Park.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I began to stare at the disk with rapt interest. Clutching the\r\nastronomer by the sleeve, I exclaimed excitedly:\r\n\r\n“Look there! Odd I never noticed it before! The face of the Man in the\r\nMoon is the living image of that Chinese devil, Kwo-Sung-tao!”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” agreed Dr. Gresham with a shudder. “And it makes my flesh creep\r\neven to look at it!”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMen Sing Hymn As They Go To Death\r\n\r\n\r\nMarooned on a floating ice cake in the Missouri River, with all hope of\r\nrescue gone, Harvey McIntosh and his brother, Tom, of Mondamin, Iowa,\r\nbravely sang, “Nearer My God to Thee,” while the ice floe carried them to\r\na swift and certain death. Their friends lined either side of the river,\r\nbut were unable to reach them. Night came on, and from the darkness came\r\nthe strains of the old hymn, which gradually grew fainter and then ended\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In All the World There Was No Man Quite Like This One_\r\n\r\nThe Man the Law Forgot\r\n\r\n_By_ WALTER NOBLE BURNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jail was silent. Boisterous incoherencies that in the day made the\r\nvast gloomy pile of stone and iron a bedlam—talk, curses, laughter—were\r\nstilled.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were asleep in their cells. Dusty electric bulbs at sparse\r\nintervals made a dusky twilight in the long, hushed corridors. Moonlight,\r\nshimmering through the tall, narrow windows, laid barred, luminous\r\nlozenges on the stone floors.\r\n\r\nFrom the death cell in “Murderers’ Row,” the voice of Guisseppi rose in\r\nthe still night watches in the _Miserere_. Its first mellow notes broke\r\nthe slumberous silence with dulcet crashes like the breaking of ice\r\ncrystals beneath a silver hammer. Vibrating through the cavernous spaces\r\nof the sleeping prison, the clear boyish voice lifting the burden of the\r\nsolemn hymn was by turns a tender caress, a flight of white wings up into\r\nsunny skies, a silver whisper stealing through the glimmering aisles, a\r\nswift stream of plashing melody, a flaming rush of music.\r\n\r\n“_A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise._” The\r\nprayer in its draperies of melody filled the cells like a shining\r\npresence and laid its blessing of hope upon hopeless hearts. From the\r\nshadow of the gallows, Guisseppi poured forth his soul in music that was\r\nbenediction and farewell.\r\n\r\nBitter memories, like sneering ghosts that elbow one another, crowd\r\nthe road to Gallows Hill. In swift retrospect, Guisseppi reviewed his\r\nlife’s last tragic phase. Young, with healthy blood dancing gay dances\r\nthrough his veins, sunny-spirited, spilling over with the happiness and\r\nhopefulness of irresponsibility, he had not despaired when the death\r\nsentence was pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe court’s denial of his lawyer’s motion for a new trial left him with\r\nundiminished optimism. Yet a while longer hope sustained him when his old\r\nfather and mother kissed him good-by through the bars and set off for the\r\nstate capital to intercede with the governor.\r\n\r\nBowed with years and broken with sorrow, they had pleaded in tears\r\nand on their knees. The venerable father, lost for words, helplessly\r\ninarticulate, the mother with her black shawl over her head, white-faced,\r\nhysterical, both praying for the life of their only son, were a picture\r\nto melt a heart of stone.\r\n\r\nThe pathos of it stirred the governor to the depths, but could not make\r\nhim forget that for the moment he stood as the incarnation of the law and\r\nthe inexorable justice that is the theory of the law. With heavy heart\r\nand misty eyes, he turned away.\r\n\r\nSo hope at last had died. And between the death of hope and the death\r\nthat awaited him, Guisseppi brooded in the death-cell, bitterly counting\r\nhis numbered days as they slipped one by one into the past, each day\r\nbringing him that much nearer to certain annihilation. Round and\r\nround the dial, the hands of the clock on the prison wall went in a\r\nnever-ending funeral march; the _tick-tock, tick-tock_ of the pendulum,\r\nmeasuring off the fateful seconds, echoed in his heart like a death knell.\r\n\r\nTimes without number he repeated to himself that he was not afraid to\r\ndie. Nevertheless the inevitability of death tortured him. At times, in\r\nsheer terror, he seized the rigid bars of his cell, pounded his fists\r\nagainst the iron walls, till the blood spurted from his knuckles. He was\r\nlike a sparrow charmed by a serpent, fluttering vainly to escape, but\r\ndrawing ever nearer to certain death. Black walls of death kept closing\r\nin upon him inexorably, like a mediaeval torture chamber.\r\n\r\nSome men, the experts say, are born criminals; other are made criminals\r\nby some fortuity or crisis of circumstances. Guisseppi had been a happy,\r\nhealthy, careless boy. His father was a small shopkeeper of the Italian\r\nquarter who had achieved a certain prosperity. His mother was a typical\r\nItalian mother, meek, long-suffering, tender, her whole life wrapped up\r\nin her boy, her husband and her home.\r\n\r\nGuisseppi had received a good common school education. He had been a\r\nchoir boy in Santa Michaela Church, and the range and beauty of his\r\nvoice had won him fame even beyond the borders of the colony; musicians\r\nfor whom he had sung had grown enthusiastic over his promise and had\r\nencouraged him to study for the operatic stage.\r\n\r\nThe exuberance of youth, and love of gayety and adventure, had been\r\nresponsible for his first misstep. His companions of the streets had\r\nenticed him into Cardello’s pool room. Cardello, known to the police as\r\n“The Devil,” had noted with a crafty eye the lively youth’s possibilities\r\nas a useful member of his gang. His approaches were subtle—genial\r\npatronage, the pretense of goodfellowship, an intimate glass across a\r\ntable. The descent to Avernus was facile.\r\n\r\nAlmost before he knew it, Guisseppi was a sworn member of Cardello’s gang\r\nof reckless young daredevils and a participant in their thrilling nightly\r\nadventures. Home lessons were forgotten. His mother lost her influence\r\nover the boy. Even Rosina Stefano, the little beauty of the quarter, who\r\nhad claimed all his boyish devotion since school days, had no power to\r\nturn him from his downward course.\r\n\r\nHe had been taken by the police after a robbery in which a citizen had\r\nbeen killed. He was condemned to death.\r\n\r\n“I forgive everybody,” Guisseppi told his death-watch. “Everybody but\r\n‘Devil’ Cardello. If it had not been for him, I would be free and happy\r\ntoday. He made me a thief. That is his business—teaching young fools to\r\nrob for him. He did the planning; we did the jobs. We took the chances,\r\nhe took the money. I was in the hold-up when the gang committed murder,\r\nbut I myself killed no man.\r\n\r\n“And now the gallows is waiting for me, while Cardello sits in his pool\r\nroom, immune, prosperous, still planning crimes for other young fools. If\r\nI could sink my fingers in his throat and choke his life out, I could die\r\nhappy. One thing I promise him—if my ghost can come back, I will haunt\r\nhim to his dying day.”\r\n\r\nMorning dawned. Father and mother arrived for a final embrace. Rosina\r\ngave him a last kiss. A priest administered consolation. The sheriff\r\ncame and read the death warrant.\r\n\r\nLight, flooding through the barred windows from the newly-risen sun,\r\nfilled the jail with golden radiance as, through the iron corridors, feet\r\nshuffling drearily, the death march moved in solemn silence toward the\r\ngallows....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoctors with stethoscopes watched the final pulsations of ebbing life.\r\nThey pronounced him dead.\r\n\r\nThe body was wheeled off on a tumbril into the jail morgue and turned\r\nover to assistants of an undertaker employed by the family. Placing it on\r\na stretcher and covering it with a mantle, these hurried it to a motor\r\nambulance waiting in the alley. They slid the stretcher into the vehicle\r\nand slammed the doors. The machine got quickly under way, gathered speed,\r\nbegan to fly through the streets.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the doors of the ambulance slammed shut than strange things\r\nbegan to happen inside. A physician and a nurse who had been secreted in\r\nthe car, fell upon the body with feverish haste, stripped it of clothing,\r\ndashed alcohol over it from head to foot, began to massage the still warm\r\nflesh, chafing the wrists, slapping limbs and torso with smart, stinging\r\nthumps.\r\n\r\nThen, to conserve what little heat remained, they bundled the body in\r\nheavy blankets kept warm in a fireless contrivance. And all the while the\r\nambulance, its gong clanging madly, was plunging at wild speed across the\r\ncity, swaying from side to side, turning corners on two wheels.\r\n\r\nIt drew up at last in front of a small undertaking shop on a back street,\r\nand the body was hurried inside. Laid upon a table, it looked as if\r\ncarved from ivory. The coal-black hair curled about the white brow in\r\nglossy abandon. The long black lashes of the nearly-shut eyes left deep\r\nshadows on the cold pallor of the cheeks. No tint of blood, no sign of\r\nlife appeared.\r\n\r\nQuickly a pulmotor was applied. Oxygen was pumped into the lungs while\r\nthe body was again vigorously rubbed with alcohol. Guisseppi’s father and\r\nmother and close relatives stood about in an excited group, eyes wide\r\nwith feverish interest, their hearts in their mouths. Doctors and nurses\r\nworked with dynamic energy.\r\n\r\nNo sign of rekindled life rewarded them. Their drastic efforts seemed\r\nlost labor. The boy’s soul, apparently, had journeyed far into the dark\r\nplaces beyond life’s pale and was not to be lured back to its fleshly\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nStill they persisted, hoping against hope.\r\n\r\n“_Per dio!_” suddenly exclaimed a physician. “Do you see that?”\r\n\r\nA faint flush appeared in Guisseppi’s cheek.\r\n\r\n“He lives again!” burst in a tense whisper from the bloodless lips of the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe tiny stain spread, tinging the marble flesh.\r\n\r\n“My boy, my darling boy!” cried the mother, wringing her hands in\r\ndelirious joy.\r\n\r\nGuisseppi’s chest began to rise and fall slowly, with an almost\r\nimperceptible movement of respiration. The suspicion of a smile hovered\r\nfor a moment at the corners of his mouth.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes. _He lived!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_II._\r\n\r\n“Devil” Cardello sat at his desk in a corner of his pool room. The\r\nmorning was young; no customers had yet arrived to play pool or\r\nbilliards. Basco, the porter, pail and mop in hand, stood for a moment\r\ngossiping.\r\n\r\n“They say he died game,” remarked Basco.\r\n\r\n“They all do,” sneered Cardello.\r\n\r\n“And kept his mouth shut.”\r\n\r\n“No; he spilled everything. But the police didn’t believe him. That’s all\r\nthat saved me.”\r\n\r\n“I heard he said his ghost would come back to haunt you.”\r\n\r\n“Ho! That’s a good one,” laughed Cardello. “The devil has got him on a\r\nspit over the fire and will keep him turning. I should worry about the\r\nlittle fool’s ghost!”\r\n\r\nA whisper of sound from the direction of the billiard tables caused both\r\nmen to glance up.\r\n\r\nThere stood Guisseppi a few paces away, surveying them in silence, a\r\nblue-steel revolver in his hand!\r\n\r\n“Mother of God!” screamed Basco, dropping his pail and mop, and dashing\r\ninto the street.\r\n\r\nCardello’s eyes bulged from their sockets. His face went as white as\r\npaper. Panic, terror, pulled his lips back in a ghastly grin from his\r\nchattering teeth. He rose heavily to his feet and stood swaying.\r\n\r\n“Guisseppi!” he breathed scarcely above a whisper. “_Guisseppi!_”\r\n\r\nGuisseppi’s lips curled.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied. “The boy you ruined, betrayed, sent to death on the\r\ngallows.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, Guisseppi. The _police_ got you. I was your friend.”\r\n\r\n“Liar! But for you, I would be happy; my father and mother would not bear\r\nthe black disgrace of a son hanged on the gallows.”\r\n\r\n“Why have you come back from the dead, Guisseppi? Why should you haunt\r\nyour old pal?”\r\n\r\n“I have a score to settle with you.”\r\n\r\n“In the name of God the Father, go back to the grave! Leave me in peace.”\r\n\r\nGuisseppi raised his weapon.\r\n\r\n“I have come to kill you,” he said.\r\n\r\nCardello fell upon his knees.\r\n\r\n“Spare me, Guisseppi!” he screamed, stretching out imploring arms.\r\n“Mercy, Guisseppi, mercy! Don’t—”\r\n\r\nThere was a crash—a leap of fire.\r\n\r\nA wisp of blue smoke drifted above a billiard table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III._\r\n\r\nThe police dragnet for the slayer of Cardello was far flung, and zest\r\nwas added to the man hunt by the offer of $1,000 reward. Throughout the\r\nItalian quarter, Basco spread the story of Guisseppi’s recrudescence and\r\nhis ghostly revenge.\r\n\r\nThe superstitious residents accepted the weird tale with simple faith.\r\nFear of the phantom became rife. Children remained indoors after dark.\r\nPedestrians quickened their pace when passing lonely spots at night.\r\nTurning a corner suddenly, they half-expected to come face to face with\r\nGuisseppi’s ghost, wry-necked from the hangman’s noose.\r\n\r\nPoliceman Rafferty, traveling beat in the neighborhood of Death Corners,\r\nwas told time and again that Guisseppi’s ghost had murdered Cardello.\r\nYes, it was true. Basco had seen the phantom. Others in the colony had\r\nseen it slipping like a shadow through some deserted street at night.\r\nThere was no doubt that Guisseppi had come back from the dead.\r\n\r\nPoliceman Rafferty laughed. When had ghosts started in bumping off live\r\nfolks? That was what he would like to know. How could the poor simpletons\r\nbelieve such stuff? Funny lot of jobbies, these dagoes!\r\n\r\nBut when Policeman Rafferty had heard the story of Guisseppi’s ghost for\r\nthe thousandth time, he scratched his head and did a little thinking, not\r\nforgetting the $1,000 reward. Guisseppi was dead. Of course. He had been\r\nhanged, and the newspapers had been full of the stories of his execution.\r\nSo Guisseppi couldn’t have killed Cardello. That was out of the question.\r\nBut could it be possible that dead Guisseppi had a living double? Hah!\r\n\r\nPoliceman Rafferty got in touch with his favorite stool-pigeon without\r\ndelay. Shortly thereafter, that worthy laid before him a piece of\r\ninformation which Policeman Rafferty was welcome to for just what it\r\nwas worth and no more. Guisseppi’s ghost had been seen oftenest in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of Guisseppi’s father’s residence. If the fool\r\ncopper thought he could put a pinch over on a ghost, he might do well to\r\nsearch Guisseppi’s old home.\r\n\r\nSo Policeman Rafferty eased himself one day through a narrow passageway,\r\nburst in suddenly at the kitchen door and started to search the premises.\r\n\r\nHe found Guisseppi whiffing a cigaret in a front room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Yes, I killed Cardello,” said Guisseppi quietly. “I’ll go with you.”\r\n\r\n“But who are you?” asked the policeman. “You can’t be Guisseppi. They\r\ntopped that boy on the gallows.”\r\n\r\n“I’m Guisseppi, all right. They brought me back to life with a pulmotor.”\r\n\r\nPoliceman Rafferty’s jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n“Back to life?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I was as dead as stone. I was gone absolutely for an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Gone? Gone where?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Somewhere. I remember standing on the trap. Then it seemed\r\nI was falling for a long time, falling—from a star—or a high mountain\r\ntop—through miles of emptiness into midnight blackness. There wasn’t\r\nany pain. I seemed to land on a deep soft cushion of feathers. I could\r\n_feel_ the darkness. It seemed to whirl and billow round me. I couldn’t\r\nsee myself—or feel myself. But I knew, somehow, I was there in the heart\r\nof the darkness. I suddenly found myself on a broad road stretching away\r\ninto night.”\r\n\r\n“Must ha’ been the road to hell,” remarked Policeman Rafferty.\r\n\r\n“Maybe so. Along this road, I glided with the swiftness of a bird on the\r\nwing. I didn’t know where I was going—”\r\n\r\n“You were bound for hell,” said Rafferty.\r\n\r\n“I heard music away off in the dark; wonderful orchestra music, violins,\r\n’cellos, wind pipes. It grew louder. I never heard such beautiful music.\r\nThrough the solid blackness ahead, I saw a great mountain peak standing\r\nup, red and shining, against the sky.\r\n\r\n“Around me came a glare of bright lights. I was blinded by streaks and\r\nsplashes of color, darting, rolling, weaving into each other, changing\r\nall the time. Reds, purples, greens, blues, rolled over me in great,\r\nflashing waves. Flaring colors swirled around me in blazing whirlwinds.\r\nI was drowned in gorgeousness. It was as if a cyclone had wrecked a\r\nthousand rainbows and buried me beneath their ruins.”\r\n\r\n“What were these lights?”\r\n\r\n“Search me. I don’t know. I heard a loud, clear call out of the distance.\r\nI pushed through the storm of colors. Across a dark plain, I reached the\r\nshining, red mountain. I climbed up until I stood on the peak. I felt\r\nfine. Something struck me as a joke. I began laughing. Then, bending\r\nclose above me, I saw the faces of my mother and father and the doctors.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Guisseppi,” said Policeman Rafferty, “gettin’ hung once would ha’\r\nbeen an elegant sufficiency for most men. They’d be leery about takin’ a\r\nsecond chance. You must be stuck on dropping through a trap—eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they’ll hang me again, all right. That’s a cinch. You might think\r\nme a fool for walking with my eyes open right into this second scrape—”\r\n\r\n“A hog,” corrected Rafferty.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I came back from the dead to kill Cardello. And I killed\r\nhim. I hated that fellow. I’d like to have tortured the life out of him,\r\nkilled him by inches. His cries of agony would have been wine to me. It’s\r\nhell to be hanged. I ought to know. But I can go back to the gallows now\r\nwith a light heart. I got Cardello, and I’m ready to take my medicine.”\r\n\r\nPoliceman Rafferty bit a generous chew from his plug of tobacco.\r\n\r\n“You Eye-talians,” he remarked reflectively, “are a nutty bunch.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV._\r\n\r\nThe court room was crowded. Guisseppi’s strange story had been spread to\r\nthe four winds by the newspapers, and everybody was eager to see this man\r\nwho had passed through the mystic portals of death.\r\n\r\n“My client will plead guilty to the Cardello murder,” said Guisseppi’s\r\nlawyer. “I take it your honor will agree with me that having paid the\r\npenalty of the law for his former crime, he can not again be hanged for\r\nthat old offense.”\r\n\r\n“I do agree with you,” replied the judge. “The sentence was that on a\r\ncertain day at a certain hour, he be hanged by the neck until dead. This\r\nsentence was carried out. He was hanged. He was officially pronounced\r\ndead. It is not for me to say whether death was absolute. Perhaps a spark\r\nof life remained which was fanned back to full flame. Possibly his soul\r\nactually left the body and was recalled by some cryptic means we do not\r\nfully understand.\r\n\r\n“But, whatever the truth, his return to life creates a unique situation.\r\nI know of no precedent of which the law ever has taken cognizance. So\r\nfar as I know, this case is the first of its kind in history. Since the\r\nsentence pronounced upon this man has been carried out legally in every\r\ndetail, it is my decision that he can not again be hanged for the crime\r\nfor which he already has paid the penalty.”\r\n\r\n“There is one other point which your honor failed to consider,” said\r\nGuisseppi’s lawyer. “It is an axiom of law that a man can not, for the\r\nsame crime, be placed in jeopardy twice. A man can be placed in no\r\ngreater jeopardy than when, with a hangman’s noose around his neck, he\r\nis dropped through the trap-door of a gallows. So, whether Guisseppi was\r\nactually dead or whether a faint flicker of life remained, he is forever\r\nimmune from further punishment for the crime for which he was placed in\r\nthis great jeopardy.”\r\n\r\n“Your point may be well taken,” replied the judge.\r\n\r\n“Now, your honor, we come to the Cardello murder charge. It is at the\r\nprisoner’s own desire and against my better judgment that I enter a\r\nplea of guilty and throw him upon the mercy of the court. There are\r\nperhaps some extenuating circumstances. But he is willing to take\r\nwhatever punishment the court may see fit to inflict. In view of all\r\nthe circumstances of this extraordinary case, I make a special plea for\r\nmercy.”\r\n\r\n“I will answer your plea,” returned the judge, “by ordering the case\r\nstricken from the docket and the prisoner discharged from custody.”\r\n\r\nA murmur of amazement broke the tense hush of the crowded chamber.\r\nGuisseppi’s lawyer gasped.\r\n\r\n“Am I to understand, your honor—”\r\n\r\n“This is not mercy but law,” the judge continued. “This man is legally\r\ndead. He is without the pale of all law. A dead man can commit no\r\ncrime. No provision in the whole range of jurisprudence recognizes the\r\npossibility of a dead man’s committing a crime. No man, in the purview of\r\nthe law, can return from the dead. If we assume that this man was dead,\r\nhe will remain dead forever in the eyes of the law. If by a miracle he\r\nhas returned to life and committed murder, there is no punishment within\r\nthe scope of the statutes that can be decreed against him.\r\n\r\n“He is the super-outlaw of all history. Forever beyond the reach of law,\r\nthe statutes are powerless to deal with him or punish him in any way. If\r\nhe should shoot down every member of the jury that convicted him, if he\r\nshould walk into court and kill the judge before whom his case was tried,\r\nthe law could do nothing to him. He could spend his days as a bandit,\r\nrobbing, plundering, murdering, and the law could not touch him. Legally\r\nhe is a ghost, a shadow, an apparition, with no more reality than the\r\nbeings in a dream. So far as the law is concerned, he does not exist. He\r\ncan no more be imprisoned, hanged, punished or restricted in his actions\r\nthan a phantom that exists only in the imagination.”\r\n\r\n“A most wonderful construction of the law,” declared Guisseppi’s attorney\r\nin happy bewilderment at the turn of events.\r\n\r\n“It is less a construction of law as it exists than an admission there\r\nis no law applicable to a man legally dead yet actually alive, a man who\r\nunder the law does not exist. This boy, physically alive but legally\r\ndead, has murdered a man with deliberate purpose and malice aforethought.\r\nThere is no doubt about that. If the law recognized his existence, he\r\nshould be hanged. Justice demands that he be executed. But he is in some\r\nfourth-dimensional legal state beyond the reach of justice. The law is\r\npowerless to deal with him. As the administrator of the law, my hands are\r\ntied. There is nothing left for me but to set him at liberty.”\r\n\r\nDespite the decision of the court that under the law he had no existence,\r\nGuisseppi left the chamber smiling and happy, acutely conscious of joyous\r\nlife in every fibre of his being.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoliceman Rafferty was filled with righteous anger when he learned that\r\nhe could not collect the $1,000 reward. In answer to his indignant\r\nquestions, he was told the reward was offered for the arrest of “the\r\nperson or persons guilty of the murder of Cardello,” and since Guisseppi\r\nwas neither a person or anything else that the law recognized as\r\nexisting, he was not guilty of the crime.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was hinted to him that in capturing Guisseppi, he had\r\narrested nobody. In the end, Policeman Rafferty had to laugh in spite of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“The money’s mine, all right,” he said philosophically. “Only I don’t get\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_V._\r\n\r\nRosina Stefano sat alone in the little parlor of her home in one of the\r\nquaint side-streets of the Italian quarters, picturesque with its jumble\r\nof weather-stained frame dwellings and exotic little shops.\r\n\r\nIt was a chill, dreary night outside. A piping wind made fantastic noises\r\nabout eaves and gables, and shook the windows as with ghostly hands. A\r\nlamp, burning under a blue shade, filled the chamber with eerie shadows.\r\nA coal fire was dying to embers in the open grate. There was a knock at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“_Entre!_”\r\n\r\nGuisseppi threw open the door and stood upon the threshold smiling.\r\n\r\n“Rosina!”\r\n\r\nThe girl rose from her chair and stared fixedly at him out of frightened\r\neyes. With a quick gesture, as if for protection against some\r\nsupernatural menace, she made the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\n“I have come back to you, Rosina.” Guisseppi took a step toward her and\r\nthrew open his arms.\r\n\r\nRosina shrank back.\r\n\r\n“Do you not still love me?”\r\n\r\nHer lips framed a “No” for answer in a terror-stricken whisper.\r\n\r\n“Come, my little sweetheart, embrace me.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, Guisseppi!” Her voice was a tremulous cry. “You are dead!”\r\n\r\n“Dead? Certainly I am not dead. I am alive and well, and I love you just\r\nas I always loved you.”\r\n\r\n“You are only a ghost.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be foolish, little one. Do I look like a ghost? Me? Come into my\r\narms and see how strong they are. Lay your head on my breast and feel the\r\nbeating of my heart. And every beat of my heart is for you.”\r\n\r\nRosina stood motionless. There flashed through her mind old grewsome\r\nstories of vampires that lured their victims into their power with love\r\ntraps and sucked their blood. Momentary horror froze her blood.\r\n\r\n“O Guisseppi,” she exclaimed, “why have you risen from the dead? Why do\r\nyou come back to haunt me?”\r\n\r\n“Poor girl, do not talk like that. I tell you I am alive—tingling to my\r\nfinger tips with life and love for you. If I were dead, I should still\r\nlove you. Death could not kill my love for you. Have you forgotten\r\neverything? I thought you loved me. You have often told me so. I believed\r\nyou would always love me, be true to me forever. Now I find you changed\r\nand cold.”\r\n\r\n“I did love you, Guisseppi. To the depths of my being I loved you.” Her\r\nwords came in a passionate torrent in her liquid native tongue. “You were\r\nmy earth and heaven, my life, my soul’s salvation. All day my thoughts\r\nwere of you. I dreamed of you at night. There was nothing I would not\r\nhave done for you. There was nothing I would not have given you. I could\r\nhave lived for you always. I could have died for you. Did I not come to\r\nsee you every day in jail? Did I not bring you constantly dishes I had\r\ncooked myself with utmost care? Was not I close beside you in the court\r\nroom every day of the long trial?\r\n\r\n“I did everything to soothe and comfort you through all those terrible\r\ndays. Was it nothing that I remained constant when you were locked in a\r\ncell condemned to death? I was true to the very trap-door of the hangman.\r\nWhat greater proof could a woman give of her love than to remain true to\r\na man sentenced as a felon to the eternal disgrace of the gallows?”\r\n\r\nShe paused for a moment, erect, motionless, her face aflame, seemingly\r\ntransfigured like the wonder woman of a vision.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” she went on; “then there was no one like my Guisseppi; no\r\neyes so bright, no lips so tender, no face so dear. You were my god. Can\r\nI ever forget the songs you used to sing to me in the happy days before\r\n‘Devil’ Cardello crossed your life. Your voice was divine. Every note\r\nthrilled me. I loved it. To me it was the music of the stars. Nothing\r\nin all the world was so beautiful as your voice. But now your voice has\r\nchanged. There is no longer any music in it. As you speak to me, it seems\r\na voice from the sepulchre.”\r\n\r\nGuisseppi raised an arresting hand. He threw back his head. He smiled\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“My voice has changed? Listen, _cara mia_.”\r\n\r\nSlowly he began to sing an old Italian serenade. The ballad told of a\r\nknight of old who had bade a lily-white maid farewell and gone off to the\r\nwars and who, wounded and left for dead on the battlefield, was nursed\r\nback to life and returned to find his lady unchanged in her devotion\r\nagainst rivals and temptations.\r\n\r\nSoft in the opening cadences, Guisseppi’s voice grew in volume and power.\r\nIt brought out in shades and nuances of wonderful beauty all the charm\r\nand romance of the ancient tale—the sadness of farewell, the clash of\r\nbattle, the wounded soldier’s dreams of his sweetheart as life seemed\r\nebbing, the gladness of his homecoming, his happiness in reunited love.\r\n\r\nInto the music, Guisseppi threw all the ardor and passion of his own\r\nlove. There were notes like tears in his voice when, in minor strain,\r\nhe sang the sorrows and dreams of the soldier; and the final crescendo\r\npassage, vivid with renewed love, was a burst of joyous melody straight\r\nfrom his heart.\r\n\r\n“_And you loved me still the same!_” The words rose like incense from an\r\naltar. They fluttered about Rosina’s ears like a shower of rose leaves.\r\n\r\nThe girl listened, spellbound. Never in happier days had she heard\r\nGuisseppi sing with such compelling sweetness. There seemed a new and\r\nwonderful quality in his voice. With his magical music, he was like a\r\nconjurer bending her spirit to his subtle enchantments.\r\n\r\nOn a golden cloud, she was transported to the sunny shores of Italy. A\r\ncavalier sang the serenade in the moonlight to his mandolin and, leaning\r\nfrom her latticed balcony, she dropped a rose to him. The bay of Naples\r\nspread its crinkled azure before her. Against the dark, star-spangled\r\ncrystal of the night, sculptured Vesuvius upheld its canopy of smoke.\r\n\r\nAs the music steeped her senses, she fancied she could feel its golden\r\nfilaments being drawn about her, binding her more and more closely in a\r\nfairy chain. As if under the charm of melodious hypnotism, her old love\r\nreturned. All the tenderness and passion of her heart went out again to\r\nGuisseppi. The siren influence of his voice was transforming her. Her\r\nstrength of will was crumbling. She stood swaying, helpless, her eyes\r\nglowing with rekindled love.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the song ended. The spell was broken. Rosina passed a languid\r\nhand over her eyes as if to brush away a film of sleep. She seemed to\r\nwake from a trance. Guisseppi stood before her radiant, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Now will you believe I am alive? Could a dead man sing like that?”\r\n\r\nA look of awe overspread Rosina’s face.\r\n\r\n“You never sang like that before.”\r\n\r\n“This is the first time my life and happiness were ever at stake on a\r\nsong.”\r\n\r\n“The Guisseppi I used to know could not sing like that. You are not\r\nGuisseppi. You are a spirit. Some demon has taught you how to sing so\r\nbeautifully. You have come back with this new devil’s voice of yours to\r\nlure my soul to hell.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Rosina, how can you delude yourself with such foolish fancies. Do\r\nyou not see me here solid in flesh and blood?”\r\n\r\n“I see you, but I know you are only a shadow from the grave.”\r\n\r\n“If your eyes deceive you, your ears can not. You have heard me sing.”\r\n\r\n“That was some devil’s necromancy.”\r\n\r\nGuisseppi fell on his knees before her and stretched out his arms in\r\nsupplication.\r\n\r\n“I love you, Rosina. That is all I can say. The hangman’s noose was not\r\nable to strangle my love for you. Your love is more to me now than it\r\never was before. The world has turned cold to me. You are my only hope,\r\nmy refuge. I need you. I want you with all my soul.”\r\n\r\nThe girl shook her head sorrowfully. Her eyes rested upon him with\r\nsadness that was touched with renunciation.\r\n\r\n“It can never be,” she said firmly. “How you are here, I do not know.\r\nYou are dead; of that I am sure. My love for you was buried in the grave\r\nthat was dug for you. You are not the boy I once loved. You are something\r\nstrange and different. I am afraid of you. It is only with horror that I\r\ncould fancy the kisses of a dead man on my lips. The thought of a ghost’s\r\nendearments fills me with loathing. Go back to the dead. I can love and\r\nreverence those who are gone, but there is no love anywhere in all the\r\nworld for the dead returned from the grave.”\r\n\r\nShe turned away and stood with her head bowed in her hands.\r\n\r\nSlowly Guisseppi struggled to his feet. He staggered weakly against the\r\nwall and buried his face in his arms.\r\n\r\n“And you, Rosina!” he sobbed.\r\n\r\nThis was the final, crushing blow. He felt now that he was indeed\r\ndead—dead at the grave of his lost love.\r\n\r\n\r\n_VI._\r\n\r\nA taxicab stood in the narrow street near Rosina’s home, its driver ready\r\nat the wheel, its engine purring. Behind the drawn blinds, sat Guisseppi,\r\naflame with excitement, peering eagerly through the curtains from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nGuisseppi was desperate. There was no place for the dead among the\r\nliving. He had learned that clearly. As a “living dead man,” all his\r\nexperiences had been tragic. He regretted his resuscitation. He longed\r\nfor the peace of the grave.\r\n\r\nHis old friends had fallen away from him. Many believed him a spirit\r\ndamned, who, by some strange dispensation, was spared to life for yet a\r\nlittle while to make more exquisite the final agony reserved for him.\r\nOthers were intelligent enough to know the truth, but even these were\r\nrepelled by a certain unwholesomeness, a savor of the sepulchre, that\r\nseemed to cling about him.\r\n\r\nThe girls he had known in his old, gay days would have nothing to do\r\nwith him. As handsome as ever, as romantic, with a voice as musical and\r\nappealing, he was in their imagination enveloped in an atmosphere of the\r\ncharnel-house, and the curse of hell was branded on his brow.\r\n\r\nHis relatives held aloof. Between him and even his mother and father he\r\nwas conscious that a thin shadow had gradually crept, and the tenderness\r\nof their love had been cooled by a ghostly fear of this eerie son who had\r\nbeen down among the dead and read with dead eyes the mysteries beyond the\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nHe had been unable to find employment. It was as if every business house\r\nhad up a sign, “No dead men need apply.”\r\n\r\nIn despair and desperation, he fell into his old ways of banditry. He\r\nsoon had placed to his record a long series of bold robberies. For\r\nseveral of his first lawless exploits, the police arrested him. But\r\ninvariably the judges before whom he was arraigned set him at liberty.\r\n\r\nSo after a while the police refused to arrest him. What was the use? This\r\nghost-man would only be set free again.\r\n\r\n... While Guisseppi sat hidden from view behind the curtains of his\r\ntaxicab, ruminating upon the bitterness of his fate, Rosina emerged from\r\nher home. Trim and dainty with pink cheeks and sparkling eyes, the young\r\nbeauty was subtly suggestive of flowers and fragrance as she tripped\r\nalong the street in the warm sunshine.\r\n\r\nAs she came abreast of the taxicab, Guisseppi stepped out, caught her in\r\nhis arms, and swung her into the car. The girl’s wild screams shrilled\r\nthrough the slumberous stillness of the quarter and filled the streets\r\nwith excited throngs as the cab plunged madly forward, dashed around a\r\ncorner and was soon lost to sight. In a distant part of the city, the\r\ncar halted before a weather-stained building. Within the dingy doorway\r\nGuisseppi disappeared, bearing the kidnapped maiden in his arms.\r\n\r\nA little later, Guisseppi appeared before the marriage license clerk in\r\nthe city hall.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” said the clerk, “but I can not give you a marriage license.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“You are dead. You can not marry.”\r\n\r\n“But I’m _going_ to marry!” shouted Guisseppi defiantly.\r\n\r\n“Impossible. If I went through the formality of filling out a license\r\nfor you, no minister or priest would perform the wedding service. The\r\nmarriage altar, orange blossoms, the happiness of domestic love are not\r\nfor the dead.”\r\n\r\n“But I’m _alive_! I am only _legally_ dead.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk smiled tolerantly. With a pencil he drew a circle on a sheet of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said he, “is a cipher. It is the symbol of nothing, but, as a\r\ncircular pencil mark, it is still something.”\r\n\r\nHe erased every trace of the pencil and exhibited the blank piece of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n“This,” he explained, “illustrates your status. In human affairs, you\r\nare a cipher with the rim rubbed out. A man legally dead is less than\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_VII._\r\n\r\nLuigi Romano, who had succeeded Guisseppi in Rosina’s affections, was\r\namong the first to hear of the abduction.\r\n\r\nBlazing with passion, he laid his plans with quick decision and took the\r\ntrail. Without great difficulty, he traced the route of the taxicab,\r\nblock by block, to its destination.\r\n\r\nDepressed by his fruitless mission in search of a marriage license,\r\nGuisseppi was hurrying toward the building in which Rosina was\r\nimprisoned. His eyes were bent upon the ground in deep thought. His face\r\nwas white and drawn.\r\n\r\nLuigi stepped from the shelter of a doorway with a sawed-off shotgun in\r\nhis hands....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the police arrived, a little crowd of Italians had gathered.\r\n\r\nThey shrugged their shoulders and spread their palms. Nobody had seen\r\nanything; nobody had heard anything; nobody knew anything. But one thing\r\nwas plain—the dead man, sprawled on the sidewalk, was dead this time to\r\nstay dead.\r\n\r\n“O yes,” said Attorney Malato, who had looked after Luigi’s case, “they\r\narrested Luigi all right. But they turned him loose. Why not? This boy\r\nGuisseppi could not be punished by the law, but neither could he claim\r\nin the slightest degree the protection of the law. Since he had no legal\r\nlife, it was no crime to kill him. He was a legal problem, and Luigi\r\nsolved it in about the only way it could be solved—with a sawed-off\r\nshotgun.”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is often wondered why the earth is round instead of being some other\r\nshape. This is because of the attraction of gravity, which tends to pull\r\neverything toward the center of the world. It can be seen that even if\r\nthe earth was originally some other shape, in the course of a few years\r\nthis influence would have pulled it into its present shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Gripping, Powerful Story by a Man Who Always Tells a Good Tale_\r\n\r\nThe Blade of Vengeance\r\n\r\n_By_ George Warburton Lewis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outcome was all the more regrettable because Henry Fayne had staked\r\nso much on the success of his great venture. He had renounced innumerable\r\nbachelor friendships for Leanor, only to discover within a year of the\r\ncelebrated social event, which had been their wedding, that he was linked\r\nfor life to a captivating adventuress.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard blow. Only by desperate efforts, long sustained, had he\r\nbeen able to take himself in hand and force out of his thoughts the ugly\r\nimages that obsessed him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLeanor’s perfidy was a thing of which even his best friends never could\r\nhave convinced him; yet now he knew it to be true—aye, knew it because\r\nshe herself had boasted of it!\r\n\r\nFayne had striven hard to shut so hideous a specter out of his vision,\r\npartly because of a haunting fear that the thing which the discovery had\r\nset throbbing in his brain would get the better of him, that he would\r\nhurt somebody, or himself.\r\n\r\nHe had been an unusually well-balanced man, but it was only after many a\r\nstern struggle with the pulsating thing that hammered in his head that he\r\nsurrendered the corpse of his outraged love to the divorce court and the\r\ngossip-mongers, and went sadly back to his bachelor haunts in the hope\r\nof forgetting. But he was appalled to find that he no longer fitted in.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the free and easy days of his celibacy were sincere enough\r\nin their pity for him, though in no way disposed to put themselves out\r\nseeking reclamation. In short, they might as well have said in chorus:\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t have expected us to forewarn you; you’d have quit us cold.\r\nYou had to discover it for yourself, and the operation of finding out has\r\nsimply rendered you impossible as one of the old crowd. Sorry, old man,\r\nbut, after all, it’s better that you should know.”\r\n\r\nSo Henry Fayne brooded, lost his nerve, and then, all of a\r\nsudden—disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe old circle knew his set and cynical face no more. There were rumors\r\nof mental breakdown and suicide, and there was one report (little\r\ncredited, however) that the unfortunate fellow had drifted down into the\r\nwilds of South America and become an eccentric and a recluse.\r\n\r\nLeanor tired, in time, of the murderous velocity of her social chariot,\r\ndumped the winged vehicle on the trash-heap and went abroad, accompanied\r\nby a less rich and more ambitious retinue of high livers.\r\n\r\nLike vari-colored butterflies, five years winged overhead, years by\r\nno means lacking in color and variety for Leanor. Exacting as were\r\nher tastes, she could scarcely have desired a more changeful, a more\r\nexquisitely exhilarating life.\r\n\r\nOnly once in a blue moon did she think of Henry. Thoughts of him, like\r\nall other memories of her meteoric past, had been crowded into oblivion\r\nby the inrush of the more intimate and actual.\r\n\r\nHenry had been very good to her, she had to admit, but he had been none\r\nthe less impossible. The outcome had been inevitable from the beginning.\r\nHe was fifteen years her senior. She knew that she could never have\r\nheld her volatile self down to a life of self-sacrifice and suffering\r\nwith Henry. The idea was no less absurd than the mating of an esthetic\r\nhumming-bird with some sedate old owl.\r\n\r\nWhen she consented to marry Henry she had entertained no such\r\npreposterous thought as exacting of him a compliance with the\r\nridiculously restricted code of ethics he subsequently set for her.\r\nIndeed, she would have grown old and ugly with nothing accomplished,\r\nunseeking and unsought. Too, there would have been lamentably fewer\r\nnotches on her ivory fan than the half-decade last past had yielded.\r\n\r\nAs the wretched venture had turned out, however, she was still under\r\nthirty and was, to employ the homely simile of her latest masculine\r\nobjective, “as pretty as a peach.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Pacific entrance of the Grand Canal, where the town of Bandora\r\ndrowses like a sprawling lizard on the sun-baked clay, word went round\r\nthat the millionaire adventuress was yachting down the west coast,\r\nhomeward bound.\r\n\r\nEverybody who read the public prints knew about Leanor, so at least one\r\nelement at Bandora awaited her arrival with curious interest. And the\r\ncurious were to be gratified, for since pretty Leanor habitually did the\r\nunexpected, she only proved her consistency when, upon her arrival, she\r\ncapriciously decided to tarry a fortnight, with the two-fold object of\r\nhaving a look at the great waterway and exploring historic Batoga Island,\r\nonly a couple of hours distant.\r\n\r\nShould the mighty monument to engineering skill prove uninteresting,\r\nthere remained the secret caves of Batoga, among them _La Guaca de San\r\nPedro_, by allegation the identical haunted, bat-inhabited cavern in\r\nwhich buccaneering old Henry Morgan had once stored all of his ill-gotten\r\ngains and maybe imprisoned the unfortunate nuns captured at Porto Bello!\r\nAnd then, too, there was the celebrated Devil’s Channel, which, according\r\nto widely circulated and much-believed stories, sucked small craft down\r\ninto its omnivorous maw like some insatiable demon lying in wait.\r\n\r\nLeanor devoted but little time to the prodigious engineering feat. After\r\nall, it was man-made, and what was man if not a purveyor to feminine\r\ncaprices? Mere men were cheap. The adventuress knew, because she had\r\nbought and sold many of them. She had bartered the very souls of some.\r\n\r\nShe had bought them all with make-believe affection and disposed of them\r\nat a hundred per cent discount. She treated them much as one treats\r\ncast-off garments, experiencing only minor difficulties in disengaging\r\nherself from some of the more persistent.\r\n\r\nA genuine Sybarite, Leanor’s appetite for entities masculine had at last\r\ncloyed, and she now turned impatiently to inscrutable old Nature to make\r\nup the deficiency.\r\n\r\nShe went to Batoga, a verdant, mighty mountain, greenly shaggy, as yet\r\nunshorn by advancing civilization. It might have been a little separate\r\nworld, set down by nature in a sleeping sea of sapphire. Here, indeed,\r\nwas something different.\r\n\r\nShe was wild with delight as soon as her dainty feet touched the\r\nshell-paved beach. Really, this wonderland was too splendidly perfect to\r\nshare with her unpoetic company of paid buffoons! She sent the whole lot\r\nof them bagging back to Bandora, decided to employ a guide, a boatman, or\r\na native maid, contingent upon her special needs, right on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was due to this whim of Leanor’s that I myself wandered into the cast,\r\ncame to know Leanor and likewise the story I am telling you here. I had\r\njust come through a notably obstinate case of dengue in the sanitarium.\r\nMy thin knees, in fact, were still somewhat wobbly, and I was urging\r\nthem back to normal by means of a leisurely stroll across the rolling\r\npasture-land. On a grassy, wind-swept hillside I came all unexpectedly\r\nupon Leanor.\r\n\r\nEvidently she had thought to refresh her jaded wits by a revel in wild\r\nflowers. She was seated on a shelf of rock that rimmed the hill-crown,\r\nculling unworthy floral specimens. A single upward glance, and then her\r\neyes dropped back to her flowers in a world-bored manner which I somehow\r\nfelt a quick impulse to resent. At least I could annoy her. That was any\r\nfool’s privilege.\r\n\r\n“Gathering flowers?” I interrogated, just as though that fact were not as\r\nobvious as the blue sky itself.\r\n\r\nFor answer, my front-line fortifications were instantly swept by an\r\nocular onslaught well calculated to obliterate. I smiled back engagingly\r\nat the source of the tempest.\r\n\r\n“Some hill, this,” I suggested, emitting a windy sigh after the exertion\r\nof its ascent.\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw that my second drive had broken through her first-line\r\ntrench on a front of about a quarter of an inch. Disdain died slowly out\r\nof her face—a face still unaccountably fresh and girlish—and something\r\nlike pity at my apparent lack of sophistication took its place.\r\n\r\n“You really think it a high hill?” she asked, faintly smiling and gazing\r\nat me steadily as though she doubted my sanity.\r\n\r\nI noted that her hazel eyes seemed to swim in seas of a wonderfully\r\nsparkling liquid.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I qualified, affecting funereal gravity, “it’s higher than _some_\r\nhills.”\r\n\r\nHer amused smile expanded perceptibly.\r\n\r\n“Really, now, have you ever seen very many hills?”\r\n\r\n“N-no,” I reluctantly confessed, “not so _very_ many.”\r\n\r\n“What induced you to measure this one?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I was shadowing somebody,” I said quietly. At last she had given\r\nme an opening.\r\n\r\n“Whom, pray?” she demanded, her smile brightening expectantly.\r\n\r\n“_You_—if you don’t mind,” I announced.\r\n\r\n“_Me!_” She laughed deliriously for a moment.\r\n\r\n“It’s hardly a laughing matter,” I said, with forced seriousness when she\r\nwas still. “I’ve been working on this case for years.”\r\n\r\nShe sobered with a suddenness that suggested ugly thoughts, perchance\r\nremembering something of her kaleidoscopic past. The hazel eyes saddened\r\na little. It was evident that she was rummaging among happenings which it\r\ngave her small pleasure to review. I waited. Maybe I was not quite the\r\nyokel she had thought me.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean you’re a detective?” she presently asked.\r\n\r\n“I mean just that, madam,” I said evenly.\r\n\r\n“By whom are you employed?” she questioned tentatively.\r\n\r\n“By Henry Fayne,” I casually replied.\r\n\r\n“That is the lie of an impostor,” quickly asserted the woman; “Henry\r\nFayne is dead.”\r\n\r\nShe rose from the stone shelf and prepared to desert me. Anyhow, I had\r\nwon my point. I had succeeded in annoying her.\r\n\r\nBut I concluded I could hardly let the matter so end, even as affecting a\r\nwoman like Leanor. Nobody can afford to be openly rude.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” I said; “let’s be good sportsmen. You tilted at me and I\r\nretaliated. Honors are even. Why not forget it?”\r\n\r\nShe was greatly relieved; and besides, forgetfulness, of all things, was\r\nwhat she sought. After a moment, deep wells of laughter again glistened\r\nin her splendid eyes. These and the smiling young mouth somehow seemed to\r\ngive the lie to the fiasco she had made of life. What a pity, I thought,\r\nthat she had chosen to fritter away her life in this fatuous, futile\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nI had thought that I should feel only contempt for such a woman as\r\nLeanor, but as we walked down the hill she told me something that\r\npenetrated a hitherto unknown weak spot in my armor. So I all but pitied\r\nthe woman I had prepared to despise.\r\n\r\nAs if to take strength from them, she kept her eyes on the wild flowers\r\nshe had gathered, as she pronounced the well-nigh unbelievable words I\r\nnow set down.\r\n\r\nThe craze for the blinding white lights, and the delusion of equally\r\nwhite wines, were surfeited. The gilt and tinsel of the truly tawdry had\r\npalled. The mask of allurement had fallen from the forbidding face of\r\nthe artificial and empty. Life itself had become for Leanor a vacant and\r\nmeaningless thing. She had seen too much of it in too brief a space.\r\n\r\nShe concluded with a seeming contradiction, a veiled regret that her\r\nfrenzied explorations had exhausted all too soon the world’s meager store\r\nof things worth while, and there was a bitterness in her voice which\r\ncontrasted unpleasantly with her youth and beauty as she said plainly,\r\nthough with little visible emotion, that she had reached a point where\r\nlife itself often repelled and nauseated her.\r\n\r\nWe had reached the sanitarium by this time, an interruption not unwelcome\r\nin the circumstances, and I left the strange woman alone with her tardy\r\nregrets and sought my own quarters, sympathetic and depressed, yet\r\nthanking my lucky stars for the happy dispensation that had made me an\r\nadventurer instead of an “adventuress.”\r\n\r\nThat evening, Leanor and I planned a trip to Devil’s Channel, and\r\nI strolled down to the beach in search of such a shallow-draught\r\n_cayuco_ as could maneuver its way over the reefs that barred larger\r\ncraft. _Boteros_ of divers nationalities abounded, and among the many\r\nmy questioning gaze finally met that of a vagabondish-looking fellow\r\ncountryman in a frayed sailor garb. In odd contrast to his raiment, and\r\nswinging from his belt in a sheath which his short coat for an instant\r\ndid not quite conceal, I caught a single glimpse of a heavy hunting knife\r\nwith an ornamented stag-horn handle.\r\n\r\nHis name was Sisson, he told me, but he spoke Spanish like a native. His\r\nuncarded beard was a thing long forgotten of razors. He was unmistakably\r\nanother of those easily identified tramps of the tropics who, in an\r\nunguarded moment, unaccountably lose their grip on themselves and\r\nthenceforward go sliding unresistingly down to a not unwelcome oblivion.\r\n\r\nSisson did not importune me, as did all the other boatmen; he did not\r\neven offer me his services; and it was because of this evidence of\r\nsome lingering vestige of pride, coupled with the fact that he had an\r\neminently suitable _cayuco_, that I decided to employ him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the narrow gateway of Devil’s Channel the water is so shallow, and\r\nthere so frequently occur tiny submerged sand-bars, that only the\r\nminutest of sea craft can skim over the gleaming rifts and gain entrance.\r\nThis was confirmed for the nth time when I felt the specially made keel\r\nof our tiny _cayuco_ scrape the shiny sand in warning that we were at\r\nlast entering the canyon-like waterway.\r\n\r\nLeanor and I were both playing our splendid oarsman with well-nigh every\r\nimaginable question about the gloomy, spooky-looking channel before us.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t we nearing _the place_ yet?” Leanor presently asked.\r\n\r\n“Farther in,” drawled Sisson, the bearded giant of a boatman, glancing\r\ncarelessly at the ascending cliffs on either side.\r\n\r\nTwisting my body round in the wee native _cayuco_, I noted that the\r\nperpendicular walls of the shadowy strait that lay before us seemed\r\ndrawing together with every pull of Sisson’s great arms. Leanor’s pretty\r\nface was radiant with expectation. Though bored of the world, there was\r\nat least one more thrill for her ahead.\r\n\r\nFive minutes slipped by. Sisson rowed on steadily.\r\n\r\n“There she is!” the boatman said suddenly, for the first time evincing\r\nsomething like a normal human interest in life. One of his huge, hairy\r\nhands was indicating an alkali spot on the face of the right-hand wall a\r\nstone’s throw ahead. “Just opposite that white spot is where _it always\r\nhappens_.”\r\n\r\nHe released his oars and let them trail in the still water. It looked\r\npeculiarly lifeless. Our small shell gradually slowed.\r\n\r\n“Seems to be all smooth sailing here today, though,” I ventured.\r\n\r\n“Overrated, for the benefit of tourists,” opined Sisson. “The water’s\r\neaten out a little tunnel under the west wall, but there’s no real danger\r\nif you know the chart.”\r\n\r\n“How many did you say were drowned when that launch went down?” again\r\nasked Leanor. Her great dark eyes were sparkling again now with a keen\r\nnew interest in life—or was it the nearness to potential death?\r\n\r\n“Eleven,” drawled Sisson. “The engineer jumped for it and made a\r\nlanding on that bench of slate over there, and right there”—he smiled\r\nreminiscently—“he sat for seventy-two hours, with ‘water, water\r\neverywhere, nor any drop’—”\r\n\r\n“And is it true that none of the life-preservers they were putting on\r\nwhen the launch sank was ever found?” Leanor also wanted to know.\r\n\r\n“True enough,” said Sisson, “but that’s not unnatural. Drowning men lay\r\nhold of whatever they can and never, _never_ turn loose. Why, I’ve seen\r\nthe clawlike fingers of skeletons locked around sticks that wouldn’t bear\r\nup a cockroach!”\r\n\r\n“Did you say it was a relatively calm day?” I questioned the boatman idly.\r\n\r\n“Sure. Calm as it is right now,” he answered.\r\n\r\nI observed casually that the oarsman was gazing fixedly at Leanor. Even\r\non him, perhaps, beauty was not entirely lost. Doubtless, too, he had\r\nheard the gossip her arrival had set going along the wharves at Batoga.\r\nMeanwhile Leanor had made a discovery.\r\n\r\n“Why, we’re still making headway!” she broke out suddenly. “I—I thought\r\nwe had stopped.”\r\n\r\nSisson glanced down at the water, and his tanned brow broke up in\r\nvertical wrinkles of consternation. The look in his deepset eyes, though,\r\ndid not, oddly enough, seem to match the perplexity written on his\r\ncorrugated brow.\r\n\r\nOur craft was sliding rapidly forward as though propelled by the oars.\r\nThe phenomenon was due to a current; that much was certain, for we were\r\nmoving with a flotsam of dead leaves and seaweed.\r\n\r\nAgain I screwed my body half round in the cramped bow and shot a glance\r\nahead. God! we were shooting toward the dread spot on the alkali cliff as\r\nthough drawn to it by an unseen magnet. I could see, too, that our speed\r\nwas rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nSisson snatched up the trailing oars and put his giant’s strength against\r\nthe invisible something that seemed dragging us by the keel, but all\r\nhe did was to plough two futile furrows in the strange whirlpool. Our\r\n_cayuco_ glided on.\r\n\r\nThe _blasé_ adventuress was never more beautiful. For the time, at least,\r\nlife, warm and pulsating, had come back and clasped her in a joyous\r\nembrace. Her lips were parted in a smile of seemingly inexpressible\r\ndelight. There was not the remotest suggestion of surprise or fear in her\r\ngirlish face.\r\n\r\nShe put her helm over only when I shouted to her in wide-eyed alarm, but\r\nthe keen, finlike keel of our specially built _cayuco_ obviously did not\r\nrespond. Oblique in the channel, we slithered over, ever nearer to the\r\nwest wall, the unseen agent of destruction towing us with awful certainty\r\ntoward the vortex. Still the surface of the water, moving with us,\r\nlooked as motionless as a mill-pond! It was uncanny, nothing less.\r\n\r\nI peered into the bluishly transparent depths, fascinated with wonder,\r\nand then, of a sudden, I saw that which alone might prove our salvation.\r\nApparently we were in a writhing, powerful current, racing atop the\r\nseemingly placid undersea or sub-surface waters of the channel. I\r\ncould make out many small objects spinning merrily about as they flew,\r\nsubmerging, toward the whirlpool.\r\n\r\nWe carried six life-belts. Two of these I snatched from their fastenings,\r\nslipped one about Leanor, and with the other but partly adjusted—for\r\nthere remained no time—myself plunged out of our—as it were—bewitched\r\ncraft in the direction of the west wall.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise I swam easily. When I made a deep stroke, however, I could\r\nfeel strange suctorial forces tugging at my finger-tips. But for the\r\nmoment I was safe.\r\n\r\nI glanced about to see if Leanor had followed my lead. She was not in the\r\nwater. I turned on my back and saw, to my utter amazement, that neither\r\nshe nor Sisson had left the _cayuco_.\r\n\r\nThis was unaccountable indeed. And it was now clear that it was too late\r\nfor them to jump, for the light boat had already begun to spin round in a\r\ncircle at a point exactly opposite the alkali spot! Faster and faster it\r\nflew, the diameter of the ring in which it raced swiftly narrowing.\r\n\r\nAs I swam, my shoulder collided with some obstruction. It was the west\r\nwall. I clambered up a couple of feet and sat dripping on a slime-covered\r\nshelf of slate, the identical slab on which the engineer of the sunken\r\nlaunch had thirsted.\r\n\r\nI was powerless to help my companions. I could only sit and stare in near\r\nunbelief. Why—_Why_ had they not abandoned the tiny craft with me? I saw\r\nnow that neither had even so much as got hold of a life-belt. Why—?\r\n\r\n_My God!_ What was this I beheld? Sisson had advanced to the stern of the\r\nflying cockleshell where Leanor still sat motionless, unexcited, smiling.\r\nThe charmed look of expectancy was still in her perfect face.\r\n\r\nSisson’s voice, suddenly risen high, chilled me to the marrow. It might\r\nhave been the voice of some martyr on the scaffold. He did not reveal\r\nhis identity to Leanor. It was not necessary. Something—I dare not say\r\nwhat—enabled her in that awful moment of tragedy to know _her divorced\r\nhusband_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe exquisite torture of recollection had shriveled Henry Fayne’s\r\nmentality and left him a semi-maniac, yet here, after all the cynical,\r\nembittering years was the physical, the carnate Henry Fayne, the\r\nlong-discarded plaything of feminine caprice. His suffering was fearfully\r\nrecorded in the seamed and bearded mask of his altered features.\r\n\r\nThe smile did not leave Leanor’s face. The madman’s voice rose in a\r\nshrill, terrible cry. He babbled and sputtered in consuming rage, but\r\nI caught the current of his wild harangue. He had waited all the years\r\nfor this opportunity; he had followed her from Bandora, had laid all his\r\nplans with infinite nicety to avenge the wreck which Leanor had made of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nBut the woman laughed defiantly, tensely; laughed derisively, full in the\r\nbearded face.\r\n\r\n“You have waited too long, Henry,” she said, evenly yet with a note of\r\ntriumph in her tone; “I’ve worn threadbare every allurement of life.\r\nToday I came here seeking my last adventure—a sensation at once new and\r\nultimate—_death_!”\r\n\r\nIt was here that the miracle supervened.\r\n\r\nChagrin, fierce and awful, distorted the hairy vagabond’s face, and,\r\nbalancing himself precariously in the crazily whirling dugout, he\r\nraised a great clenched fist. I once had seen a laughing man struck\r\nby lightning. As the rending voltage shot through him the muscles of\r\nhis face had relaxed slowly, queerly, as if from incredulity, just as\r\nthe furious, drawn face of Henry Fayne relaxed now. The menacing fist\r\nunclinched and fell limply at his side.\r\n\r\nOf all the examples of thwarted vengeance I had ever seen on the stage,\r\nor off, this episode from real life was the most dramatic.\r\n\r\nThe boat had circled swiftly in to the center of the vortex and now spun\r\ncrazily for a moment as though on a fixed pivot, like a weather-vane.\r\nThen it capriciously resumed its first tactics, only it now raced\r\ninversely in a rapidly widening circle, running well down in the water,\r\nas though from some powerful submarine attraction.\r\n\r\nThat the spurious boatman was a victim of some hopeless form of insanity\r\nI was certain when I saw him drop to his knees and extend both his great\r\nhands in evident entreaty to the woman who had stripped him of his\r\nhonor and, driven him, a driveling idio-maniac, into exile. Leanor sat\r\nimpassive, but the madman continued to supplicate.\r\n\r\nNever did my credulity undergo so mighty a strain as when, after a\r\nmoment, the woman reached out and locked her slim hands in his. It was a\r\nstrange picture, believe me! From my uncertain perch on the slimy ledge\r\nof slate, I stared, thrilling deep in my being at this futile truce on\r\nthe brink of eternity.\r\n\r\nIts revolutions greatly widened and its speed diminished, the tiny boat\r\nsuddenly swerved from its circular course, bobbed upward as though a\r\ngreat weight had been detached from its keel and then drifted like some\r\nspent thing of life toward the west wall, where I crouched dumbfounded,\r\nmy breath hissing in my nostrils, my lungs heaving.\r\n\r\nOnly now am I coming to the crux of this story of which the foregoing\r\nforms a necessary prelude.\r\n\r\nBack at Batoga that same night, in an obscure corner of the wide cool\r\nporch of the palm-environed sanitarium, Henry Fayne and Leanor, after\r\na long heart-to-heart talk alone, agreed to forgive and forget. Later\r\nin the evening Fayne went down to the contiguous village to assemble\r\nhis meager belongings. They would be interesting souvenirs with which\r\nto decorate the walls of the rehabilitated home. I found Leanor sitting\r\nwhere he had left her on the porch, smiling enigmatically.\r\n\r\n“Can I act, or not?” she asked me rather abruptly as I came up.\r\n\r\n“Act?” I groped; “what do you mean?”\r\n\r\nShe sat there, smiling mysteriously in the white moonlight, until I\r\nat length prevailed upon her to pour into my incredulous ears how it\r\nhad flashed upon her, in the crucial moment at the whirlpool, that she\r\nmust convince Fayne that to destroy one who seeks death would give no\r\nsatisfaction to a seeker after vengeance. She had made him see that the\r\nmost effective way of wreaking his revenge would be to prevent her taking\r\nher own life and force her to live with him again as in the old days.\r\nWhat, indeed, could be greater punishment than that?\r\n\r\nSo once again the wily adventuress had tricked poor Henry Fayne. It had\r\nbeen a close thing, but her lightning wits had saved her to look forward\r\nenchantedly to the prospect of other adventures. Though she had, in\r\nfact, tired of life, she had weakened before death; yet the fortitude\r\nof skillful artifice underlying that physical fear bespoke such a\r\nresourcefulness as I had never before seen in any woman.\r\n\r\nShe had spoken more truth than she knew when she said that Henry Fayne\r\nwas dead, for, mentally, he no longer existed.\r\n\r\nBut Leanor had one more card to play. When she had outlined her campaign,\r\nI sat aghast at the frank inhumanity of her plans for the morrow. She\r\nhad already made arrangements with the native officials of the nearby\r\nvillage. She was to appear in court and testify, and I was to be summoned\r\nto give evidence before the committing judge. Henry Fayne was to be\r\nruthlessly chucked into the Acorn Insane Asylum!\r\n\r\nAfter Leanor had retired to her apartment I lingered a while in the\r\nfragrant night to smoke a cigar and meditate, for I was badly upset by\r\nher pitiless resolve. As I sat reviewing the strange events of the day,\r\nthe dark figure of a man, half bent and retreating rapidly among the\r\ndappled shadows of the palms, startled me unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nAt my first glimpse of the skulker, some sixth sense told me that he had\r\nbeen eavesdropping Leanor and me from under the elevated porch on which I\r\nsat. As soon as the flitting shadow had melted into the gloom I slipped\r\noff the porch and investigated.\r\n\r\nMy half-formed suspicion was confirmed. The eavesdropper’s footprints\r\nwere quite distinct. He had crouched directly under the chairs which the\r\nadventuress and I had occupied.\r\n\r\nI did not retire until an hour later. An indescribable feeling of dread\r\nhad, though for no adequate reason, begun to weigh upon my spirits and to\r\nnag my nerves.\r\n\r\nThe first faint glimmer of dawn was in the east when something touched\r\nme softly on the shoulder. I remembered that I had left my porch window\r\nopen, and sprang up in a sudden flurry of alarm, but my nerves slackened\r\nquickly when the intruder, a black Jamaican, showed me his watchman’s\r\nbadge.\r\n\r\nThe old negro was afraid something had happened. He had heard stealthy\r\nfootfalls upstairs, and somebody’s bedroom door was wide open. On looking\r\ninto the room he had seen—!\r\n\r\nBut at this point in his story he choked, overcome. He was an excitable\r\nand superstitious old black at best, but now he was fairly beside himself\r\nwith a terror for which he had no explanation. The occupant of the room,\r\nI surmised, had gone out on the porch, properly enough, to smoke an\r\nearly morning cigar. But the old watchman would not be reassured until I\r\nconsented to accompany him up to the second floor.\r\n\r\nI noted, as we advanced along the corridor, that a door stood ajar. I\r\ntapped tentatively. No answer. I repeated the summons, louder. Still no\r\nanswer. I walked in.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight that flooded the porch outside filtered in, subdued,\r\nthrough the lace-curtained windows. It revealed a bed. In the center\r\nof the bed was the figure of a woman—all in snow white save a single\r\ndark-hued covering of some sort which sprawled across the full bosom.\r\n\r\nA nameless something made me fumble rather hurriedly for the electric\r\nswitch. The bright light showed what I had dreaded, almost expected. The\r\ndark-colored garment was not a garment at all. It was blood.\r\n\r\nIt dyed the white bosom repellently and, still welling from its fountain,\r\nwas fast forming a ragged little pool on the bedcovering. Fair over the\r\nvictim’s heart, the ornamented stag-horn handle of a heavy hunting-knife,\r\nnone of the blade visible, stood up like a sinister monument, somehow\r\nincreasingly familiar to my gaze; and after an instant’s reflection I\r\ncould have sworn—so plainly did my eyes visualize the motive for this\r\nhorror—that I beheld a single word scrawled in crimson along the mottled\r\nstaghorn handle:\r\n\r\n“_VENGEANCE!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAir Transportation Between Chicago and New York To Be Established\r\n\r\n\r\nChicagoans will soon be able to run down to New York on business early\r\none morning and be back home in time for breakfast the next day, if\r\nthe plans for dirigible service between the two cities carry through.\r\nA number of prominent Americans are members of a corporation that is\r\nbuilding several huge, helium-filled balloons in the Schutte-Lanz\r\nCompany’s plant in Germany, according to Benedict Crowell, former\r\nsecretary of war, who is the president of the new corporation. The\r\nairships will carry passengers and freight, it was announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_It Was a Frightful, Incredible Thing, Found in the Amazon Valley_\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY DEATH\r\n\r\n_By_ LOUAL B. SUGARMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nUnwaveringly, my guest sustained my perplexed and angry stare. Silently,\r\nhe withstood the battering words I launched at him.\r\n\r\nHe appeared quite unmoved by my reproaches, save for a dull red flush\r\nthat crept up and flooded his face, as now and then I grew particularly\r\nbitter and biting in my tirade.\r\n\r\nAt length I ceased. It was like hitting into a mass of feathers—there was\r\nno resistance to my blows. He had made no attempt to justify himself.\r\nAfter a momentous silence, he spoke his first word since we had entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, my friend; more sorry than you can imagine, but—I couldn’t\r\nhelp it. I simply could not touch her hand. The shock—so suddenly to come\r\nupon her—to see her as she was—I tell you, I forgot myself. Please convey\r\nto your wife my most abject apologies, will you? I am sorry, for I know I\r\nshould have liked her very much. But—now I must go.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t go out in this storm,” I answered. “It’s out of the question.\r\nI’m sorry, too; sorry that you acted as you did—and more than sorry that\r\nI spoke to you as I did, just now. But I was angry. Can you blame me? I’d\r\nbeen waiting for this moment ever since I heard from you that you had\r\ncome back from the Amazon—the moment when you, my best friend, and my\r\nwife were to meet. And then—why, damn it, man, I can’t understand it! To\r\npull back, to shrink away as you did; even to refuse to take her hand or\r\nacknowledge the introduction! It was unbelievably rude. It hurt her, and\r\nit hurt me.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, and that is why I am so very sorry about it all. I can’t\r\nexcuse myself, but I can tell you a story that may explain.”\r\n\r\nI saw, however, that for some reason he was reluctant to talk.\r\n\r\n“You need not,” I said. “Let’s drop the whole matter, and in the morning\r\nyou can make your amends to Laura.”\r\n\r\nAnthony shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It’s not pleasant to talk about, but that was not my reason for\r\nhesitating. I was afraid you would not believe me if I did tell you.\r\nSometimes truth strains one’s credulity too much. But I will tell you. It\r\nmay do me good to talk about it, and, anyhow, it will explain why I acted\r\nas I did.\r\n\r\n“Your wife came in just after we entered. She had not yet removed her\r\nveil or gloves. They were gray. So was her dress. Her shoes—everything\r\nwas gray. And she stood there, her hand outstretched—all in that color—a\r\nbody covered with gray. I can’t help shuddering. _I can’t stand gray!_\r\nIt’s the color of death. Can your nerves stand the dark?”\r\n\r\nI rose and switched off the lights. The room was plunged into darkness,\r\nsave for the flicker of the flames in the fireplace and the intermittent\r\nflashes of lightning. The rain beat through the leafless branches outside\r\nwith a monotonous, slithering _swish_ and rattled like ghostly fingers\r\nagainst the windows.\r\n\r\n“The light makes it hard to talk—of unbelievable things. One needs the\r\ndarkness to hear of hell.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. The _swir-r-r_ of the rain crept into the stillness of the\r\nroom. My companion sighed. The firelight shone on his face, which floated\r\nin the darkness—a disembodied face, grown suddenly haggard.\r\n\r\n“A good night for this story, with the wind crying like a lost soul in\r\nthe night. How I hate that sound! Ah, well!”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence.\r\n\r\n“It was not like this, though, that night when we started up the Amazon.\r\nNo. Then it was warm and soft, and the stars seemed so near. The air was\r\nfilled with scent of a thousand tropical blossoms. They grew rank on the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n“There were four of us—two natives, myself and Von Housmann. It is of\r\nhim I am going to tell you. He was a German—and a good man. A great\r\nnaturalist, and a true friend. He sucked the poison from my leg once,\r\nwhen a snake had bitten me. I thanked him and said I’d repay him some\r\nday. I did—sooner than I had thought—with a bullet! I could not bear to\r\nsee him suffer.”\r\n\r\nThe man sat there, gazing into the flames—and I listened to the dripping\r\nrain fingering the bare boughs and _tap-tap-tapping_ on the roof above.\r\n\r\nMy friend looked up.\r\n\r\n“I was seeing his face in the flames. God help him!... We had traveled\r\nfor days—weeks—how long does not matter. We had camped and moved on; we\r\nhad stopped to gather specimens—always deeper into that evil undergrowth.\r\nAnd as we moved on, Von Housmann and I grew close; one either grows to\r\nlove or hate in such circumstances, and Sigmund was not the sort of man\r\none would hate. I tell you, I loved that man!\r\n\r\n“One day we struck into a new place. We had long before left the tracks\r\nof other expeditions. We _trekked_ along, unmindful of the exotic beauty\r\nof our surroundings, when I saw our native, who was up ahead, stop short\r\nand sniff the air.\r\n\r\n“We stopped, too, and then I noticed what the keener, more primitive\r\nsense of our guide had detected first.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“It was an odor. A strange odor, indefinable and sickening. It was filled\r\nwith foreboding—evil. It smelt—_gray_! I can not describe it any other\r\nway. It smelt dead. It made me think of decay—decay, and mould and—ugly\r\nthings. I shuddered. I looked at Von Housmann, and I saw that he, too,\r\nhad noticed it.\r\n\r\n“‘What is that smell?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n“He shook his head.\r\n\r\n“‘Ach, dot iss new. I haf not smelled it before. But—I do not lige it. It\r\niss not goot. Smells is goot or bat—und dot is not goot. I say, I do not\r\nlige dot smell.’\r\n\r\n“Neither did I. We went ahead, cautiously now. A curious sense pervaded\r\nthe air. It puzzled me. Then it struck me: _silence_. Silence, as though\r\nthe music of the spheres had suddenly been snuffed out. It was the utter\r\ncessation of the interminable chirping and chattering of the birds and\r\nmonkeys and other small animals.\r\n\r\n“We had become so accustomed to that multitudinous babel that its\r\nabsence was disturbing. It was—eerie. Yes, that’s the word. It made that\r\nfirst impression of lifelessness more intense. Not death, you understand.\r\nEven death has in it a thought of life, an element of being. But this was\r\njust—lifelessness.\r\n\r\n“The gray odor had become so strong it was wellnigh unbearable. Then we\r\nsaw our guides running back to us. They rebelled. They refused to go\r\nbeyond the line of trees ahead. They said it was _tabu_.\r\n\r\n“That ended it. No promise, no threat, nothing would move them. Do you\r\nknow what a savage’s _tabu_ is? It is stronger than death. And this place\r\nwas _tabu_. So we left them there with our stuff, and Sigmund and I went\r\non alone. We reached the farthest line of trees and stopped on the edge\r\nof a clearing.\r\n\r\n“I can’t describe that sight to you. But I can see it—good God, how I\r\ncan still see it! Sometimes I wake up in the night with that nightmarish\r\npicture in my eyes, and my nostrils filled with that ghoulish stench.\r\n\r\n“It was a field of gray; almost, I might have said, a field of _living_\r\ngray. And yet, it did not give the impression of life. It moved, although\r\nthere was not a breath of wind; not a leaf on the trees quivered, but\r\nthat mass of gray wiggled and crawled and undulated as though it were a\r\nhuge gray shroud that was thrown over some monstrous jelly-like Thing.\r\n\r\n“And that Thing was writhing and twisting. The gray mass extended as far\r\nas I could see ahead; to the right the sandy shore of the river stopped\r\nit; and to the left and in front of us it terminated at a distance of a\r\nfew yards away from the trees where a belt of sand intervened.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how long we stood there, my friend Von Housmann and I. It\r\nfascinated us. At last he spoke.\r\n\r\n“‘_Heilige Mütter. Was kommt da?_ Vat in der name off all dot iss holy do\r\nyou call dot? Nefer haf I seen such before. Eferyvere I haf traffeled,\r\nbut nefer haf I seen a sight lige dot. I tell you, it makes my flesh\r\ncrawl!’\r\n\r\n“‘It makes me sick to look at it,’ I answered. ‘It looks like—like living\r\ncorruption.’\r\n\r\n“The old German shook his head. He was baffled. We knew we were looking\r\nupon something that no living mortal had ever gazed upon before. And our\r\nflesh crawled, as we watched that Thing writhing beneath its blanket of\r\ngray.\r\n\r\n“We walked slowly and cautiously across the strip of sand to the edge of\r\nthe gray patch. As I bent over, the pungency of the odor bit into the\r\nmembrane of my nostrils like an acid, and my eyes smarted.\r\n\r\n“And then I saw something that drove all other thoughts from my mind.\r\nThe mass was a mosslike growth of tiny gray fungi. They were shaped like\r\nminiature mushrooms, but out of the top of each grew a countless number\r\nof antennae that twisted and writhed around ceaselessly in the air.\r\n\r\n“They seemed to be feeling and groping around for something, and it was\r\nthis incessant movement that gave to the patch that quivering undulation\r\nwhich I had noticed before. I stared until my eyes ached.\r\n\r\n“‘What do you make of it?’ I asked my friend.\r\n\r\n“‘_Ach_, I do not know. It iss incompbrehensible. I haf nefer seen such\r\na—a t’ing in my whole, long life. It iss, I should say, some sort off\r\na fungoid growt’. Ya, it iss clearly dot. But der species—um, dot iss\r\n_not_ so clear. Und dose liddle feelers; on a fungus dot iss new. It iss\r\nunheard off. See, der _veddammte_ t’ings iss lige lifting fingers; dey\r\nsvay und tvist lige dey vas feeling for somet’ings, not? I am egseedingly\r\ncurious. Und, I am baffled—und, my frient, I do not lige dot.’\r\n\r\n“Impatiently, he reached out a stick he was carrying: a newlycut, stout\r\ncudgel of dried wood. He stirred around with it in the growth at his\r\nfeet. And then a cry broke from his lips.\r\n\r\n“‘_Ach, du lieber Gott—gnadig Gott im Himmel! Sieh’ da!_’\r\n\r\n“I looked where he was pointing. His hand trembled violently. And little\r\nwonder! The stick, for about twelve inches up, was a mass of gray!\r\n\r\n“And as I watched, I saw, steadily growing before my eyes, that awful\r\ngray creep up and surround the wood. I’m not exaggerating; I tell you,\r\nin less time than it takes to tell, it had almost reached Von Housmann’s\r\nhand. He threw it from him with an exclamation of horror.\r\n\r\n“It fell in the gray growth and instantly vanished. It seemed to melt\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Sigmund looked at me. He was pale. At last he sighed.\r\n\r\n“‘So-o-o! Ve learn. On vood it grows. I might haf guessed. Dot iss der\r\nreason dot no trees are here. It destroys dem. But so _schnell_; _ach_,\r\nlige fire it growed. My frendt, I lige dot stuff lesser _als_ before. It\r\nis not healt’y. But vat vill it not eat?’\r\n\r\n“I handed him my rifle. He took it, and with the muzzle poked the growth.\r\nMan, my hair fairly stood on end! Do you know anything about fungi? No?\r\nWell, I have never known or heard of any vegetable growth that would\r\nattack blue steel. But that stuff, I tell you, that rifle barrel sprouted\r\na crop of that gray moss as readily and as quickly as had the wood!\r\n\r\n“I grabbed the gun and lifted it out of the patch. Already several inches\r\nof steel had been eaten—literally _eaten_—off. I held it up and watched\r\nthat damnable gray crawl along the barrel. It just seemed to melt the\r\nmetal. It melted like sealing wax, and great gray flakes dropped off to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n“Nearer and near it came; to the rear sight, the trigger-guard, the\r\nhammer. It was uncanny—like a dream. I stood there, paralyzed. I could\r\nnot believe what my eyes told me was true. I looked at Sigmund. His mouth\r\nwas open and his face was white as death. I laughed at his face. That\r\nseemed to tear away the mist. He yelled and pointed, and I looked down.\r\n\r\n“Not two inches from my hand was that mass. I could see those feelers\r\nreaching out toward my hand and I was sick. Instinctively, I threw the\r\ngun from me; aimlessly, blindly. It fell on the sand belt outside the\r\ngray mass.\r\n\r\n“Hardly had it struck the sand before the growth had reached the butt,\r\nand then there was nothing to be seen but a tiny patch of that gray,\r\npoisonous Thing. And as we looked, it began to melt. Gradually, steadily,\r\nit was disappearing.\r\n\r\n“‘Quick, quick,’ shouted Von Housmann, and we ran over to the spot. By\r\nbending over, we could see what was happening.\r\n\r\n“The feelers, or antennae, which we had noticed before, had vanished, but\r\ninstead, at the bases of each individual plant, were similar tendrils.\r\nBut more of them—thousands and thousands of them all feeling and groping\r\nfrantically about. And as they swayed and twisted and brushed the sand,\r\none by one they shriveled up and seemed to withdraw into the parent body.\r\n\r\n“And gradually this nucleus itself shrank and withered, until it was no\r\nmore than a tiny gray speck on the sand. Soon that was all that was left;\r\na lot of tiny whitish particles, much lighter in color than the original\r\nplant, scattered around on the sand.\r\n\r\n“I looked at Von Housmann, and he looked at me. After a long interval, he\r\nspoke. He spoke slowly, almost as though it were a painful effort.\r\n\r\n“‘Ant’ony, ve haf seen a—miracle. From vat, or how, or ven, dot\r\nhell-growt’ sprang, I do not know. I do not know how many, many years it\r\nhas stood here; may be it has been for centuries. But I do know this: if\r\ndot sand was not here—vell, I shudder to t’ink off vat vould be today.’\r\n\r\n“I stared.\r\n\r\n“‘You do not understand? _Ach_, so! You haf vat happened to dot stick?\r\nUnd to dot gun of steel? So! Look, now.’\r\n\r\n“He took off his hat and went over to the border of the patch. He\r\ntouched—just barely touched the brim of the hat to the gray matter and\r\nheld it up. Already a growth was moving up the linen. He nodded, then\r\nthrew it away, onto the sand. Speechless, we watched it fade away under\r\nthe merciless attack of that horrible stuff, and then, in turn, the gray\r\nfungoid growth wither and disappear.\r\n\r\n“‘Now do you understand? Do you see vat I meant? Vood, steel,\r\nlinen—eferyt’ing vat it touches it _eats_. It grows fast—like flame in\r\ndry sticks. All-consuming. Aber—_siest du_—dot sand—ven it touched dot,\r\nit died. It starved. Und see! Look close—more closer still at dot sand.\r\nDo you see anything odd about it?’\r\n\r\n“I shook my head. It looked very fine and light, but I could not see\r\nanything unusual.\r\n\r\n“‘No? Iss it not glass, dot sand? Look at it und at der sand vere dot\r\nT’ing has not been, and see if it is not so different.’\r\n\r\n“I picked up some sand from under my foot. And then I saw what _he_ had\r\nseen at once. The sand in my hand was coarser, dirtier—in short, like\r\nany fine-grained sand you may have seen. But the sand where the Grey had\r\nfallen was clear, glasslike. It was almost transparent, and I saw that\r\nwhat was there was a mass of silicon particles. I nodded.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I see now. That stuff has eaten out every particle of\r\nmineral, of dirt and dust, but not the silicon!’\r\n\r\n“‘Egsactly! Und dot iss vat has safed us from—Gott only knows vot! I\r\ndo not know what dot stuff vill eat, but I _do_ know it vill not eat\r\nsilicon. Vy? _I_ do not know. Dot iss yet a mystery. So—it starts,—_ach_,\r\ndot too, I do not know—but it starts somewhere. Und it eats und grows,\r\nund grows and eats, and eferyt’ing vot it touches it consumes—egcept\r\nsand. Sand stops it.\r\n\r\n“‘It eats out der stuff in der sand, but not der silica, und starves and\r\ndies. It is a miracle. If der sand vas not here—_ach, Gott!_—it vould\r\nkeep on going until—vell—I do not know! I haf nefer seen dot before. I\r\nam intrigued, und I am going to take dot stuff—oh, only a liddle bit—und\r\nI shall not rest until I haf learned something about it. Und, because I\r\nhaf seen it does not lige sand, I vill make for it a cage—a liddle box of\r\nglass, und study it lige it vas a bug. Not?’\r\n\r\n“We returned to where our natives still stood with our packs. We quickly\r\nfitted together some microscopic slides into a rough box and bound it\r\nabout with string. With it, we returned to the edge of the gray patch.\r\nVon Housmann knelt down and carefully scooped up a bit of the fungus with\r\na glass spatula he had brought along. He dumped this into his box and\r\nwaited. In five minutes it had disappeared. He looked up blankly.\r\n\r\n“‘You forget, Sigmund,’ I said, smiling at his woeful expression. ‘It\r\nstarves on silicon. It won’t live in glass.’\r\n\r\n“‘_Ach. Dumkopf!_ Of course! I haf forgot dot. But, ve vill fool dot\r\nhell-plant. He goes yet on hunger-strike—no? Ve try now dot forcible\r\nfeeding.’\r\n\r\n“He took out his knife and cut from a near-by tree several small\r\nsplinters.\r\n\r\n“Ve vill feed him, so. Dot vood, it vill be for him a greadt feast, und\r\nhe shall eat und eat, und we vill study him und see vot we vill see.’\r\n\r\n“Laughing, he bent over and shook out the tiny gray residue which was in\r\nthe box. He dropped in a sliver of wood and was bending over to refill\r\nhis box when I felt a sting on my foot. I looked down, and my heart stood\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n“On my shoe, just in between the laces, was a spot of gray. I could not\r\nmove. I was cold. I can not describe how I felt, but I seemed turned to\r\nstone. My flesh quivered and shrank and I was sick—very sick. Sigmund\r\nlooked up, startled, and then he looked at my feet.\r\n\r\n“The next thing I knew I was on my back, my foot in his hand. One slash\r\nof his knife across the thongs which laced my boot, and he jerked it off.\r\n\r\n“The biting grew worse. I heard him gasp, and then I felt a sharp pain.\r\nMy head swam and I must have fainted. I regained consciousness—I don’t\r\nknow how soon after—and I found myself back under the trees. I looked\r\nat my foot, which was throbbing and burning like fire. It was swathed\r\nin a bandage that Von Housmann had taken from his emergency kit and was\r\nwrapping around the instep. It was deeply stained with blood. I moved,\r\nand he looked up. He smiled when he saw I was conscious.\r\n\r\n“‘Dot was a close shave—yes? It had just eaten into der shoe as I pulled\r\nit off und one spot—lige a bencil dot—on your skin vas gray. So I cut it\r\nout and all around it, und so you haf a hole in your foot, but—you haf\r\nyour foot. Now so! You lie here, und I get der niggers and ve take you to\r\nbed.’\r\n\r\n“A tent was soon erected and I was carried into it. For two days I lay\r\nthere, delirious half the time. Sigmund never left my side. He even\r\nslept there. He was insistent that it was his fault. He said one of the\r\napparently dead fungi had dropped on my shoe and had revived there. That\r\nis, the plant, instead of dying, had shriveled up, but the life-nucleus\r\nwas still strong. I shudder even now when I think of what might have been.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the third day I was able to hobble about a little with\r\nthe aid of a cane. That afternoon Sigmund came to me and asked if I\r\nwould care to go with him to fill his little glass box. I refused, and\r\nhe laughed. It was the last time I ever heard him laugh. I begged him to\r\nleave that stuff alone.\r\n\r\n“Still laughing, he made some light reply and left me. I lay in my cot.\r\nI was filled with forebodings. The heat was intense, and I must have\r\ndropped off to sleep. I dreamed horrible, troublesome, weird dreams. I\r\nawoke, bathed in a cold sweat. I felt sure something was wrong, that some\r\none was calling for me. I got to my feet and left my tent. No one was in\r\nsight. I tried to laugh at my premonition. I bitterly regretted that I\r\nhad allowed my friend to override my persuasions.\r\n\r\n“Hurrying as much as was possible, I started toward the clearing. My\r\nwound throbbed and ached. It tortured me. I seemed weighed down. Once I\r\nstumbled in my eagerness. It was horrible. Like a nightmare.\r\n\r\n“I must have covered half the distance when I heard a scream. What\r\na shriek it was! I wake up nights even now hearing it. It was\r\nunrecognizable. Like some unearthly animal. Just that one scream. My\r\nstick hindered me. I threw it away and ran.\r\n\r\n“My blood was cold in my veins, but I felt not one twinge of pain in my\r\n_foot_. At last I came to the edge of the clearing. And there—God, it\r\nmakes me sick even now to think of it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused; his face was chalky, and he shuddered and buried his\r\nface in his hands. I think he was crying.\r\n\r\nOutside, the wind still howled, dully, monotonously, eerily. Sometimes it\r\nwould shriek and scream. Then my friend’s voice again—level, dead, cold.\r\n\r\n“I looked out; I saw Sigmund standing on the sand. I can see him as\r\nplainly as though he were here now. His face was ashen. He was looking\r\ndown. At his feet were the fragments of the glass box he had made.\r\n\r\n“He was holding out his hands, looking at them. They were gray. And they\r\nwrithed and twisted, but his arms were still. He was not even trembling.\r\nMy tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, and my throat was dry—but at\r\nlast I called to him.\r\n\r\n“‘Sigmund—Sigmund!’ I cried. ‘For God’s sake—’\r\n\r\n“He looked up, and, I tell you, I never want to see such a face again!\r\nI can never forget it. The face of a soul in torture. He looked at me\r\nand held out his arms. His hands were gone—flaked off in large, gray,\r\nwrithing drops to the sand at his feet!\r\n\r\n“He tried to smile, but couldn’t.\r\n\r\n“Another gray—Thing—dropped off. I was dizzy with sickness. It was\r\nunbelievable. And then he spoke. His voice was well-nigh unrecognizable.\r\nIt croaked and broke:\r\n\r\n“‘Done for, my friendt. I feel it eating to my heart. Be merciful and\r\nhelp me. _Shoot_—quick, through the foreheadt!’\r\n\r\n“His words beat through the stupor clouding my brain, I started toward\r\nhim—hands out-stretched. I could not speak.\r\n\r\n“‘_Um Gottes Willen, bleibt da!_ Stop! Stop!’\r\n\r\n“The words brought me up to a stop.\r\n\r\n“‘Sigmund! My friend! What—?’\r\n\r\n“‘Do not come near me! Vould you also be so tormented? Vat dot Gray\r\ntouches it consumes. Do not argue, I say, but _shoot!_ _Heilige Mütter!_\r\nVy do you not shoot?’\r\n\r\n“His voice rose into a shriek of agony. What was left of one arm had\r\nsloughed off—the other was almost gone. A little mound of gray grew\r\nlarger at his feet. His flesh was consumed; skin, blood and bone,\r\nabsorbed by that vile gray Thing, and he shrieked in agony and prayer.\r\nBoth arms were gone, and the stuff at his feet had already begun to cut\r\nthrough his boots.\r\n\r\n“I shot him—between his eyes. I saw him fall, and I fainted. When I came\r\nto, there was only a mound of tiny gray fungi, greedily reaching their\r\nhellish tentacles for sustenance and slowly shriveling up into tiny light\r\ngray specks of dust on a glossy patch of sand.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSavants No Longer Know All Things\r\n\r\n\r\n“Men in the business of knowing things have taken a tip from the\r\nplumbers, carpenters and plasterers,” announced Friar McCollister, one\r\nof the University of Chicago literati. “No longer is it possible to go\r\nto a hoary old gentleman with a pile of books and a skull on his desk\r\nand ask him any question, from the date of the birth of Copernicus to\r\nthe conjugations of the verb ‘to know’ in Sanscrit, and get an answer.\r\nThe scholar nowadays has learned to say what the plumber says when you\r\nask him to fix the hole he has made in the wall: ‘That is not in my\r\ndepartment.’ I found this out the other day when I tried to get some\r\ninformation on the discovery of a human skull three million years old.\r\n\r\n“First, I went to the information office of the University. There I\r\nencountered a sprightly young man who turned out to be a professor of\r\nsociology. But he didn’t know anything about men three million years old.\r\nHe only studied living men, he said. ‘Better go over to Haskell Museum,’\r\nhe told me. ‘They have some skulls and mummies over there.’\r\n\r\n“I ran up three flights of stairs and into a dusty old room where I saw\r\na Dr. Edgerton. He was copying strange characters out of a book yellow\r\nwith age. When I put my question he replied that the only ancients he\r\nknew were Egyptian mummies. He said I should see an anthropologist. Back\r\nto the information office to see where they kept the anthropologists.\r\n\r\n“They sent me up to Walker Museum, where a bland young man said, ‘Freddie\r\nStarr is not in, but you don’t want an anthropologist, anyway. You want\r\nto see an ethnologist.’\r\n\r\n“When I found one, after dogging him all over the campus, he told me that\r\nthe matter really belonged in the department of geology. From there they\r\nsent me to see the department of paleontology. At last I located it in\r\na cubby-hole of a museum which I didn’t even know was there, although I\r\nhave been on the campus three years.\r\n\r\n“‘But, my dear sir,’ replied the head of the department to my\r\nquestion, ‘that is not in my department. What you want is a vertebrate\r\npaleontologist, and I am only a plain paleontologist. At present we have\r\nno vertebrate paleontologist at the University. The last one died a few\r\nyears ago.’\r\n\r\n“Well, I gave up my search,” said Mr. McCollister. “This age of\r\nspecialization is too much for me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAncient Legend Recalled When Misfortune Attends Tut’s Discoverers\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an old legend to the effect that whoever molests the final\r\nresting-place of a Pharaoh will be afflicted with the curse of the\r\nancient rulers; and recent events have revived this superstition.\r\n\r\nAfter thirty-three years of patient, ceaseless toil, Howard Carter, the\r\nnow famous Egyptologist, discovered the tomb of a powerful Pharaoh. He\r\nwas a very sincere man, and devoted to his life work all of his energy.\r\nJust when success and reward for his labor was within his grasp, he was\r\nstricken down with a baffling disease. His condition became very serious\r\nand physicians said that if he lived he would probably be an invalid for\r\na long time. Shortly before Carter’s illness, Lord Carnarvon, who was\r\nfinancing the expedition, and who was personally supervising the work,\r\nsuddenly died.\r\n\r\nNobody seems to know just what killed him. Some attribute his death to\r\nthe effects of an insect bite, some say that he was poisoned by some\r\nancient death-potion with which he came in contact while in the tomb, and\r\nothers declare that his death was the vengeance of King Tut-Ankh-Amen.\r\n\r\nIf such a legend could be credited anywhere, the Theban valley would\r\nbe that place. By day nothing disturbs the place except the sound of\r\nthe pick-axes and shovels of the native workmen. By night the stillness\r\nis broken only by the hooting of owls and the cries of jackals and\r\nwild-cats. The spectator is awed by the solemnity of the great,\r\nprecipitous sandstone cliffs that stand sentinel on either side of the\r\nvalley. In the midst of the silence and solitude one feels himself\r\nstanding on the brink of two worlds, gazing into a vista of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Author of “Whispering Wires” Offers Another Thriller to WEIRD TALES\r\nReaders_—\r\n\r\nThe Voice in the Fog\r\n\r\n_By_ HENRY LEVERAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Seriphus_ was a ten thousand ton, straight bow ocean tanker, and\r\nher history was the common one of Clyde-built ships—a voyage here and\r\na passage there, charters by strange oil companies, petrol for Brazil,\r\ncrude petroleum that went to Asia (for anointment purposes among the\r\nheathen) and once there was a hurried call to some unpronounceable Aegean\r\nport where the _Seriphus_ acted against the Turks in their flare-up after\r\nthe Great War.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary and usual—the up and down the trade routes—passed away from\r\nthe _Seriphus_ when Ezra Morgan, senior captain in the service of William\r\nHenningay and Son, took over the tanker and drove her bow into strange\r\nEastern seas, loading with oil at California and discharging cargo in a\r\nhundred unknown ports.\r\n\r\nOf Ezra Morgan it was said that he had the daring of a Norseman and\r\nthe thrift of a Maine Yankee; he worked the _Seriphus_ for everything\r\nthe tanker could give William Henningay and Son; he ranted against the\r\noutlandish people of the Orient and traded with them, on the side, for\r\nall that he could gain for his own personal benefit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTrading skippers and engineers with an inclination toward increasing\r\nwage by rum-running and smuggling were common in the Eastern service.\r\nEzra Morgan’s rival in that direction aboard the _Seriphus_ ruled the\r\nengine-room and took pride in declaring that every passage was a gold\r\nmine for the skipper and himself.\r\n\r\nThe chief engineer of the _Seriphus_ saw no glory in steam, save\r\ndollars; he mopped up oil to save money. His name was Paul Richter—a\r\nbrutal-featured man given to boasting about his daughter, ashore, and\r\nwhat a lady he was making of her.\r\n\r\nPaul Richter—whom Morgan hated and watched—was far too skilled in\r\nanything pertaining to steam and its ramifications to be removed from his\r\nposition aboard the _Seriphus_. Henningay, Senior, believed in opposing\r\nforces on his many tankers—it led to rivalry and efficiency, instead of\r\ncloseheadedness and scheming against owners.\r\n\r\nThe _Seriphus_, after a round passage to Laichau Bay, which is in the\r\nGulf of Pechili, returned to San Francisco and was dry-docked near\r\nOakland, for general overhauling.\r\n\r\nRichter, after making an exact and detailed report to Henningay, Jr.,\r\nvisited the opera, banked certain money he had made on the round-passage,\r\nthen went south to his daughter’s home. He found trouble in the house;\r\nHylda, his daughter, had a heart affair with a marine electrician,\r\nGathright by name, a young man with a meager wage and unbounded ambition.\r\n\r\nThrough the Seven Seas, from the time of his Bavarian wife’s death, from\r\ncancer of the breast, Richter, chief engineer of the _Seriphus_, had\r\nsweated, slaved, saved and smuggled contraband from port in order to say:\r\n\r\n“This is my daughter! _Look at her!_”\r\n\r\nNow, as Richter discovered, Hylda, twenty-seven years of age, somewhat\r\nprim and musical, had given her promise to an electrician whom the\r\nengineer believed was not fit to dust her shoes. Richter, used to\r\nbreaking and thrashing coolie oilers, ordered Gathright from the house\r\nand locked up his daughter.\r\n\r\nShe cried for seven days. Gathright was seen in town. Richter’s rage gave\r\nway to an engineer’s calculation.\r\n\r\n“What for I study in University and college? Why do I hold certificates?\r\nI fix Gathright!”\r\n\r\nNo oil was smoother than Richter’s well-laid plan; he sent Hylda away and\r\nmet Gathright.\r\n\r\n“All right about my daughter,” he told the electrician. “You go one\r\nvoyage with me—we’ll see Henningay—I’ll fix you up so that you can draw\r\none hundred and fifty dollars in wage, with a rating as electrician\r\naboard the _Seriphus_.”\r\n\r\nGathright went with Richter to San Francisco. They recrossed the Bay,\r\nwithout seeing Henningay, Jr., and, at dusk, climbed over the shoring\r\ntimbers and went aboard the _Seriphus_. Richter’s voice awoke echoes in\r\nthe deserted ship and dry-dock:\r\n\r\n“Come, I show you my dynamo and motors. We go to the boiler-room first,\r\nwhere the pumps are.”\r\n\r\nThe boiler-room, forward the engine-room of the tanker, was a place\r\nof many snakelike pipes, valves, sea-plates and oily seepage from the\r\nfeedtanks. The _Seriphus_ was a converted oil-burner, having been built\r\nbefore crude petroleum was used for steaming purposes. Three double-end\r\nScotch boilers made the steam that drove the tanker’s triple-expansion\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nRichter knew the way down to the boiler-room, blindfolded. He struck\r\nmatches, however, to guide Gathright, and remarked that the newer ships\r\nof Henningay’s fleet had a storage-battery reserve for lighting purposes\r\nwhen the dynamo ceased running.\r\n\r\nGathright, somewhat suspicious of Hylda’s father, took care to keep\r\ntwo steps behind the chief-engineer. They reached and ducked under\r\nthe bulkhead beam where the door connected the engine-room with the\r\nboiler-room. Richter found a flashlamp, snapped it on, swung its rays\r\naround and about as if showing Gathright his new duties.\r\n\r\n“There’s a motor-driven feed-pump,” he said. “Something’s the matter with\r\nthe motor’s commutator. It sparks under load—can you fix it up?”\r\n\r\nThere was a professional challenge in the chief engineer’s voice;\r\nGathright forgot caution, got down on his knees, leaned toward the motor\r\nand ran one finger over the commutator bars. They seemed polished and\r\nfree from carbon.\r\n\r\nRichter reversed his grip on the flashlamp, swung once, twice, and\r\nsmashed the battery-end of the lamp down on Gathright’s head, just over\r\nthe top of the electrician’s right ear.\r\n\r\nGathright fell as if pole-axed and dropped with his hands twitching on a\r\nmetal plate.\r\n\r\nStriking a match, Richter surveyed the electrical engineer.\r\n\r\n“Good!” he grunted. “Now I put you where nobody’ll ever look—unless I\r\ngive the order.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA stump of candle, stuck by wax to a feed-pipe, allowed Richter\r\nillumination sufficient to work by. Swearing, sweating, listening once,\r\nhe fitted a spanner to bolt-heads on a man-plate in the spare boiler and\r\nremoved the stubborn bolts until the plate clanged at his feet.\r\n\r\nGathright was a slender man, easy to insert through the man-hole; Richter\r\nhad no trouble at all lifting the electrician and thrusting him out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the engineer, as he hesitated, that Hylda’s lover moaned\r\nonce and filled the boiler with a hollow sound.\r\n\r\nHesitation passed; and Richter swallowed his superstitious fears, put\r\nback the man-hole plate, bolted it tighter than it ever was before,\r\nalmost stripping the threads, and stepped back, mopping his brow with the\r\nsleeve of a shore-coat.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing very unusual in Richter’s further actions that evening.\r\nThe ship-keeper, who came aboard at daylight, long before the dry-dock\r\nmen began work, noticed a wet shore-hose, a thin plume of steam aft the\r\ntanker’s squat funnel, and there was a trailing line of smoke drifting\r\naslant the _Seriphus’_ littered deck.\r\n\r\n“Been testing that spare boiler,” explained Richter, when the ship-keeper\r\nducked through the bulkhead door. “I think it’s tight an’ unscaled, but\r\nth’ starboard one will need new tubes and general cleaning. Get me some\r\nsoap—I want to wash up.”\r\n\r\nRichter dried his hands on a towel, tossed it toward the motor-driven\r\nfeed-pump, then, when he left the boiler-room, his glance ranged from the\r\ntightly-bolted man-hole cover up to a gauge on a steam-pipe. The gauge\r\nread seventy-pounds—sufficient to parboil a heavier man than Hylda’s\r\nlover.\r\n\r\n“I think that was a good job,” concluded the first engineer of the\r\n_Seriphus_.\r\n\r\nThe second engineer of the tanker, a Scot with a burr on his voice like a\r\nfile rasping the edge of a plate, stood watching Richter balance himself\r\nas the stout chief came along a shoring-beam.\r\n\r\n“I mark ye ha’ steam up,” commented the Scotchman, when Richter climbed\r\nover the dry dock’s wall.\r\n\r\n“Yes, in the spareboiler.”\r\n\r\nMr. S. V. Fergerson tapped a pipe on his heel.\r\n\r\n“I made an inspection, myself, of that, not later than yesterday\r\nforenoon. She was tight as a drum an’ free from scale. I left th’\r\nman-hole—”\r\n\r\n“Damn badly gasketed!” growled Richter.\r\n\r\nFergerson started to explain something; but the chief was in a hurry to\r\nget away from sight of the _Seriphus_. There was a memory on the tanker\r\nthat required a drink or two in order to bring forgetfulness. Richter\r\ngave the Scot an order that admitted of no answering back.\r\n\r\n“Go aboard an’ blow off steam! That boiler’s all right!”\r\n\r\nA roar, when Richter strode past the dry-dock’s sheds, caused him to\r\nwheel around and listen. Fergerson, according to orders, was blowing off\r\nthe steam from the spare boiler.\r\n\r\nSomething, perhaps water or waste, clogged the pipe; and the escaping\r\nvapor whistled, sputtered, and rose to a high piercing note that sounded\r\nto the chief’s irritated nerves like the cry of a soul in agony. The note\r\ndied, resumed its piercing screeching. Richter’s arm and hand shook when\r\nhe mopped his brow and drew a wet sleeve down with an angry motion.\r\n\r\nIn fancy the noise that came from the _Seriphus’_ starboard side, echoed\r\nand deflated by the hollow dock, was Gathright calling for Hylda. Richter\r\ncovered his ears and staggered away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEzra Morgan hastened such repairs as were required for making the\r\n_Seriphus_ ready for sea; the tanker left the dry-dock, steamed out the\r\nGolden Gate, and took aboard oil at a Southern California port.\r\n\r\nAll tanks, a well-lashed deck load of cased-lubricant—consigned to a\r\nrailroad in Manchuri—petroleum for the furnaces, brought the _Seriphus_\r\ndown to the Plimsoll Mark; she drove from shore and crossed the Pacific\r\nwhere, at three God-forsaken Eastern roadsteads, she unloaded and made\r\nagents for the oil-purchasers happy with shipments delivered on time.\r\n\r\nThe romance of caravan routes, and pale kerosene lamps burning in\r\nTartar tents, escaped both Ezra Morgan and Richter; they went about\r\ntheir business of changing American and English minted gold for certain\r\ncontrabands much wanted in the States. The chief engineer favored\r\ngum-opium as a road to riches; Ezra dealt in liquors and silks, uncut\r\ngems and rare laces.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the chief engineer’s peace of mind, the spare, double-end\r\nScotch boiler was not used on the Russian voyage. Gathright was forgotten\r\nand Hylda, safe in an eastern music school, was not likely to take up\r\nwith another objectionable lover. Richter, relieved of a weight, went\r\nabout the engine-room and boiler-room humming a score of tunes, all set\r\nto purring dynamos, clanking pumps, and musical cross-heads.\r\n\r\nAt mid-Pacific, on a second voyage—this time to an oilless country, if\r\never there were one, Mindanao—a frightened water-tender came through\r\nthe bulkhead door propelled by scalding steam, and there was much to do\r\naboard the _Seriphus_. The port boiler had blown out a tube; the spare,\r\nmidship boiler was filled with fresh water and the oil-jets started.\r\n\r\nRichter, stripped to the waist, it being one hundred and seventeen\r\ndegrees hot on deck, drove his force to superhuman effort. Ezra Morgan,\r\nseven hours after the accident, had the steam and speed he ordered, in no\r\nuncertain tones, through the bridge speaking-tube.\r\n\r\nFergerson, a quiet man always, had occasion, the next day, to enter the\r\nchief’s cabin, where Richter sat writing a letter to Hylda, which he\r\nexpected to post via a homeward bound ship. Richter glared at the second\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n“That spare boiler—” began Fergerson.\r\n\r\n“What of it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, mon, it’s been foamin’ an’ a gauge-glass broke, an’ there’s\r\nsomething wrong wi’ it.”\r\n\r\n“We can’t repair th’ port boiler until we reach Mindanao.”\r\n\r\nFergerson turned to go.\r\n\r\n“Ye have m’ report,” he said acidly. “That boiler’s bewitched, or\r\nsomethin’.”\r\n\r\n“Go aft!” snarled Richter, who resumed writing his letter.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated once, chewed on the end of the pen, tried to frame the words\r\nhe wanted to say to Hylda. Then he went on:\r\n\r\n    “—_expect to return to San Francisco within thirty-five days.\r\n    Keep up your music—forget Gathright—I’ll get you a good man,\r\n    with straight shoulders and a big fortune, when I come back and\r\n    have time to look around._”\r\n\r\nRichter succeeded in posting the letter, along with the Captain’s mail,\r\nwhen the _Seriphus_ spoke a Government collier that afternoon and sheered\r\nclose enough to toss a package aboard. Ezra Morgan leaned over the\r\nbridge-rail and eyed the smudge of smoke and plume of steam that came\r\nfrom the tanker’s squat funnel. He called for Richter, who climbed the\r\nbridge-ladder to the captain’s side.\r\n\r\n“We’re only logging nine, point five knots,” said Ezra Morgan. “Your\r\nsteam is low—it’s getting lower. What’s th’ matter? Saving oil?”\r\n\r\n“That spare boiler is foaming,” the chief explained.\r\n\r\n“Damn you and your spare boiler! What business had you leaving San\r\nFrancisco with a defective boiler? Your report to Mr. Henningay stated\r\nthat everything was all right in engine-room and boiler-room.”\r\n\r\n“Foam comes from soap or—something else in the water.”\r\n\r\n“Something else—”\r\n\r\nRichter got away from Ezra Morgan on a pretense of going below to the\r\nboiler-room. Instead of going below, however, he went aft and leaned\r\nover the taffrail. Somehow or other, he feared that spare boiler and the\r\nconsequence of conscience.\r\n\r\nLimping, with three-quarters of the necessary steam pressure, the\r\n_Seriphus_ reached Mindanao and was forced to return to California\r\nwithout repairs to the port boiler. While repairs, new tubes and\r\ntube-sheet were put in place by boilersmiths, Richter saw his daughter,\r\nwho had come west from music school.\r\n\r\nThe change in her was pronounced; she spoke not at all of Gathright,\r\nwhose disappearance she could not understand; and Richter, keen where his\r\ndaughter was concerned, realized that her thinness and preoccupation was\r\non account of the missing electrician.\r\n\r\n“I get you a fine fellow,” he promised Hylda.\r\n\r\nHe brought several eligible marine engineers to the house. Hylda snubbed\r\nthem and cried in secret.\r\n\r\nAn urgent telegram called Richter back to the _Seriphus_. He made two\r\nlong voyages, one down Chili-way, the other half around the world, before\r\nthe tanker’s bow was turned toward California. Much time had elapsed from\r\nthe night he had thrust Gathright into the spare boiler and turned on the\r\noil-jets beneath its many tubes. Once, in Valparaiso, an under engineer\r\npointed out red rust leaking from the gauge-glass of the spare boiler.\r\n\r\n“Looks like blood,” commented this engineer.\r\n\r\nRichter scoffed, but that afternoon he drank himself stupid on kummel,\r\nobtained from an engineer’s club ashore. Another time, just after the\r\ntanker left the port of Aden on her homebound passage, a stowaway crawled\r\nout from beneath the cold boiler and gave Richter the fright of his life.\r\n\r\n“Why, mon,” said Fergerson, who was present in the boiler-room, “that’s\r\nonly a poor wisp o’ an Arab.”\r\n\r\n“I thought it was a ghost,” blabbered Richter.\r\n\r\nBarometer pressure rose when the _Seriphus_ neared mid-Pacific. Ezra\r\nMorgan predicted a typhoon before the tanker was on the longitude of\r\nGuam. Long rollers came slicing across the _Seriphus’_ bow, drenched the\r\nforecastle, filled the ventilators and flooded the boiler-room.\r\n\r\nRichter went below, braced himself in the rolling engine-room, listened\r\nto his engines clanking their sturdy song, then waddled over the gratings\r\nand ducked below the beam that marked the bulkhead door. An oiler in high\r\nrubber-boots lunged toward the chief engineer.\r\n\r\n“There’s something inside th’ spare boiler!” shouted the man. “Th’\r\nboiler-room crew won’t work, sir.”\r\n\r\nRichter waded toward a frightened group all of whom were staring at\r\nthe spare boiler. A hollow rattling sounded when the tanker heaved and\r\npitched—as if some one were knocking bony knuckles against the stubborn\r\niron plates.\r\n\r\n“A loose bolt,” whispered Richter. “Keep th’ steam to th’ mark, or I’ll\r\nwipe a Stillson across th’ backs of all of you,” he added in a voice that\r\nthey could hear and understand.\r\n\r\nSuperstition, due to the menacing storm and high barometer, the uncanny\r\nnoises in the racked boiler-room, Richter’s bullying manner, put fear in\r\nthe hearts of the deck crew. Oil-pipes clogged, pumps refused to work,\r\nvalves stuck and could scarcely be moved.\r\n\r\n“I’ve noo doot,” Fergerson told his Chief, “there’s a ghost taken up its\r\nabode wi’ us.”\r\n\r\nRichter drank quart after quart of trade-gin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe barometer became unsteady, the sky hazy, the air melting hot, and a\r\nlow, rugged cloud bank appeared over the _Seriphus’_ port bow.\r\n\r\nDown fell the barometer, a half-inch, almost, and the avalanche of rain\r\nand wind that struck the freighter was as if Thor was hammering her iron\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nEzra Morgan, unable to escape from the typhoon’s center, prepared to ride\r\nout the storm by bringing the _Seriphus_ up until she had the sea on the\r\nbow, and he had held her there by going half speed ahead. A night of\r\nterror ruled the tanker; the decks were awash, stays snapped, spume rose\r\nand dashed over the squat funnel aft the bridge.\r\n\r\nMorning, red-hued, with greenish patches, revealed a harrowed ocean,\r\nwaves of tidal height, and astern lay a battered hulk—a freighter,\r\ndismasted, smashed, going down slowly by the bow.\r\n\r\n“A Japanese tramp,” said Ezra Morgan. “Some _Marau_ or other, out of the\r\nCarolines bound for Yokohama.”\r\n\r\nRichter, stupid from trade-gin, was on the bridge with the Yankee skipper.\r\n\r\n“We can’t help her,” the engineer said heavily. “I think we got all we\r\ncan do to save ourselves.”\r\n\r\nEzra Morgan entertained another opinion. The storm had somewhat subsided,\r\nand the wind was lighter, but the waves were higher than ever he had\r\nknown them. They broke over the doomed freighter like surf on a reef.\r\n\r\n“Yon’s a distress signal flying,” said Ezra Morgan. “There’s a few seamen\r\naft that look like drowned rats. We’ll go before th’ sea—I’ll put th’ sea\r\nabart th’ beam, an’ we’ll outboard oil enough to lower a small-boat an’\r\ntake those men off that freighter.”\r\n\r\nThe maneuver was executed, the screw turned slowly, oil was poured\r\nthrough the waste-pipes and spread magically down the wind until the\r\nfreighter’s deck, from aft the forehouse, could be seen above the waves.\r\n\r\nOver the patch of comparative calm oars dipped, and a mate, in charge of\r\nthe small boat lowered from the _Seriphus_, succeeded in getting off the\r\nsurvivors who were clinging to the freighter’s taffrail.\r\n\r\nThe small boat lived in a sea that had foundered big ships. It returned\r\nto the tanker’s bow; and the four men, bruised, broken, all half-dead\r\nfrom immersion, were hoisted to the forepeak and taken aft. Two were\r\nJapanese sailors and two were Americans—a wireless operator and an\r\nengineer. The engineer had a broken leg which required setting, and the\r\nwireless operator was in a bad fix; wreckage had stove in his features,\r\nand twisted his limbs.\r\n\r\nEzra Morgan was a rough and ready surgeon-doctor; he turned the\r\n_Seriphus_ over to the first-mate and made a sick room out of Richter’s\r\ncabin. The chief protested.\r\n\r\n“Get below to your damn steam!” roared Ezra Morgan. “You hated to see me\r\nbring aboard these poor seamen; you said I wasted fuel oil; your breath\r\nsmells like a gin-mill. Below with you, sir!”\r\n\r\nThe engine-room and boiler-room of the tanker, she being in water\r\nballast, was not unlike an inferno; the first-mate, acting on Ezra\r\nMorgan’s instructions, drove the _Seriphus_ at three-quarter speed into a\r\nseries of head-on waves; the ship rolled and yawed, tossed, settled down\r\nastern, then her screw raced in mingled foam and brine.\r\n\r\nRichter’s stomach belched gas; he became sea-sick, climbed into a\r\nfoul-smelling “ditty-box” of a cabin, aft the engine-room, and attempted\r\nto sleep off the effect of the gin. Picture-post-cards, mostly of\r\nactresses, a glaring electric over the bunk, oil and water swishing the\r\nmetal deck below, and the irritating clank of irregular-running engines\r\ndrove sleep away from him.\r\n\r\nFergerson, the silent second-engineer, came into the “ditty-box” at eight\r\nbells, or four o’clock. Fergerson’s thumb jerked forward.\r\n\r\n“I’ll have t’ use that spare boiler,” said he.\r\n\r\n“What’s th’ matter, now?”\r\n\r\n“Feed-pipes clogged in starb’ard one, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Use it,” said Richter.\r\n\r\nSteam was gotten up on the spare, double-end Scotch boiler; the\r\nstarboard boiler was allowed to cool; Fergerson, despite the tanker’s\r\nrolling motion, succeeded in satisfying Ezra Morgan by keeping up the\r\nthree-quarter speed set by the skipper.\r\n\r\nRichter sobered when the last of the trade-gin was gone; the _Seriphus_\r\nwas between Guam and ’Frisco; the heavy seas encountered were the\r\nafterkick of the simoon.\r\n\r\nRolling drunkenly, from habit, the chief went on the bridge and asked\r\nabout getting back his comfortable cabin aft. Ezra Morgan gave him no\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Better stay near your boilers,” advised the captain. “Everything’s gone\r\nto hell, sir, since you changed from kummel to gin!”\r\n\r\n“Are not th’ injured seamen well yet?”\r\n\r\n“Th’ wireless chap’s doing all right—but th’ engineer of that Japanese\r\nfreighter is hurt internally. You can’t have that cabin, this side of San\r\nFrancisco.”\r\n\r\n“What were two Americans doing in that cheap service?”\r\n\r\nEzra Morgan glanced sharply at Richter.\r\n\r\n“Everybody isn’t money mad—like you. There’s many a good engineer, and\r\nmate, too, in th’ Japanese Merchant Marine. Nippon can teach us a thing\r\nor two—particularly about keeping Scotch boilers up to th’ steaming\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\nThis cut direct sent Richter off the bridge; he encountered a bandaged\r\nand goggled survivor of the freighter’s wreck at the head of the\r\nengine-room ladder. The wireless operator, leaning on a crutch whittled\r\nby a bo’sain, avoided Richter, who pushed him roughly aside and descended\r\nthe ladder, backward.\r\n\r\nWhite steam, lurid oaths, Scotch anathema from the direction of the\r\nboiler-room, indicated more trouble. Fergerson came from forward and\r\nbumped into Richter, so thick was the escaping vapor.\r\n\r\n“Out o’ my way, mon,” the second engineer started to say, then clamped\r\nhis teeth on his tongue.\r\n\r\n“What’s happened, now!” queried Richter.\r\n\r\n“It’s that wicked spare boiler—she’s aleak an’ foamin’, an’ there’s water\r\nin th’ fire-boxes.”\r\n\r\nRichter inclined his bullet shaped head; he heard steam hissing and\r\noilers cursing the day they had signed on the _Seriphus_. A blast when a\r\ngasket gave way, hurtled scorched men between Richter and Fergerson; a\r\nwhine sounded from the direction of the boiler-room, the whine rose to an\r\nunearthly roar: Richter saw a blanket of white vapor floating about the\r\nengine’s cylinders. This vapor, to his muddled fancy, seemed to contain\r\nthe figure of a man wrapped in a winding shroud.\r\n\r\nHe clapped both hands over his eyes, hearing above the noise of escaping\r\nsteam a call so distinct it chilled his blood.\r\n\r\n“_Hylda!_”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow there was that in the ghostly voice that brought Richter’s\r\ngin-swollen brain to the realization of the thing he had done in\r\ndisposing of Gathright by bolting him in the spare boiler.\r\n\r\nNo good luck had followed that action; Hylda was still disconsolate;\r\ntrade and smuggling was at a low ebb; there was talk, aboard and ashore,\r\nof reducing engineers’ and skippers’ wage to the bone.\r\n\r\nRichter had a Teutonic stubbornness; Ezra Morgan had certainly turned\r\nagainst his chief engineer; the thing to do was to lay the ghostly\r\nvoice, make what repairs were necessary in the boiler-room, and give the\r\ntanker’s engines the steam they needed in order to make a quick return\r\npassage to San Francisco and please the Henningays.\r\n\r\nAn insane rage mastered Richter—the same red-vision he had experienced\r\nwhen he threw Gathright out of his daughter’s house. He lowered his\r\nbullet head, brushed the curling vapors from his eyes, and plunged\r\nthrough the bulkhead door, bringing up in scalding steam before the after\r\nend of the midship, or spare boiler.\r\n\r\nGrotesquely loomed all three boilers. They resembled humped-camels\r\nkneeling in a narrow shed by some misty river. Steam in quantity came\r\nhissing from the central camel; out of the furnace-doors, from a\r\nfeed-pipe’s packing, around a flange where the gauge-glass was riveted.\r\n\r\nThe _Seriphus_ climbed a long Pacific roller, steadied, then rocked in\r\nthe trough between seas; iron plates, gratings, flue-cleaners, scrapers,\r\nclattered around Richter who felt the flesh on neck and wrist rising into\r\nwater blisters.\r\n\r\nNo one had thought to close the globe-valve in the oil supply line, or to\r\nextinguish the fires beneath the spare and leaking boiler. Richter groped\r\nthrough a steam cloud, searching for the hand-wheel on the pipe line. All\r\nthe metal he touched was simmering hot.\r\n\r\nA breath of sea air came down a ventilator; Richter gulped this air and\r\ntried to locate the globe-valve with the iron wheel. Vision cleared, he\r\nsaw the red and open mouth of the central camel—the flannel-like flames\r\nand he heard through toothed-bars a voice calling, “Hylda!”\r\n\r\nFergerson and a water tender dragged their chief from the boiler room by\r\nthe heels; blistered, with the skin peeled from his features, Richter’s\r\neyes resembled hot coals in their madness. Blabbering nonsense, the\r\nengineer gave one understandable order:\r\n\r\n“Put out th’ fire, draw th’ water, search inside th’ spare boiler—there’s\r\nsomething there, damit!”\r\n\r\nEzra Morgan came below, while the spare boiler was cooling, and entered\r\nRichter’s temporary cabin—the “ditty-box” with the play actresses’\r\npictures glued everywhere. Fergerson had applied rude doctoring—gauze\r\nbandages soaked in petroleum—on face and arms.\r\n\r\n“What’s th’ matter, man?” asked Ezra Morgan. “Have you gone mad?”\r\n\r\n“I heard some one calling my daughter, Hylda.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you keep your gin?”\r\n\r\n“It’s gone! Th’ voice was there inside th’ spare boiler. Did Fergerson\r\nlook; did he find a skeleton, or—”\r\n\r\nEzra Morgan pinched Richter’s left arm, jabbed home a hypodermic\r\ncontaining morphine, and left the chief engineer to sleep out his\r\ndelusions. Fergerson came to the “ditty-box” some watches later. Richter\r\nsat up.\r\n\r\n“What was in th’ spare boiler?” asked the chief.\r\n\r\n“Scale, soda, a soapy substance.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing else?”\r\n\r\n“Why, mon, that’s enough to make her foam.”\r\n\r\nRichter dropped back on the bunk and closed his lashless eyes.\r\n\r\n“Suppose a man, a stowaway, had crawled through th’ aft man-hole, an’\r\ndied inside th’ boiler? Would that make it foam—make th’ soapy substance?”\r\n\r\n“When could any stowaway do that?”\r\n\r\nRichter framed his answer craftily: “Say it was done when th’ _Seriphus_\r\nwas at Oakland that time th’ boilers were repaired in dry-dock.”\r\n\r\nFergerson drew on his memory. “Th’ time, mon, ye went aboard an’ tested\r\nth’ spare boiler? Th’ occasion when ye took th’ trouble to rig up a\r\nshore-hose in order to fill th’ boiler wi’ water?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did ye ha’ a man-hole plate off th’ boiler?”\r\n\r\n“I removed th’ after-end plate, then went for th’ hose. We had no steam\r\nup, you remember, and our feed-pumps are motor-driven.”\r\n\r\n“Ye think a mon might ha’ crawled through to th’ boiler during your\r\nabsence?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“Ye may b’ right—but if one did he could ha’ escaped by th’ fore man-hole\r\nplate. I had that off, an’ wondered who put it back again so carelessly.\r\nYe know th’ boiler is a double-ender—wi’ twa man-holes.”\r\n\r\nRichter was too numbed to show surprise. Fergerson left the “ditty-box”\r\nand pulled shut the door. The tanker, under reduced steam, made slow\r\nheadway toward San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOne morning, a day out from soundings, the chief engineer awoke, felt\r\naround in the gloom, and attempted to switch on the electric light.\r\n\r\nHe got up and threw his legs over the edge of the bunk. A man sat leaning\r\nagainst the after plate. Richter blinked; the man, from the goggles on\r\nhim and the crutch that lay across his knees, was the wireless operator\r\nwho had been rescued from a sea grave.\r\n\r\n“No need for light,” said the visitor in a familiar voice. “You can guess\r\nwho I am, Richter.”\r\n\r\n“A ghost!” said the chief. “Gathright’s ghost! Come to haunt me!”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly to haunt you. I assure you I am living flesh—somewhat\r\ntwisted, but living. I got out of that midship boiler, while you were\r\nbolting me in so securely. I waited until you went on deck for a hose,\r\nand replaced the after man-hole cover. I was stunned and lay hidden\r\naboard for two days. Then I looked for Hylda. She was gone. I shipped as\r\nelectrician for a port in Japan. I knocked around a bit—at radio work for\r\nthe Japanese. It was chance that the _Seriphus_ should have picked me up\r\nfrom the _Nippon Maru_.”\r\n\r\n“That voice calling for Hylda,” cried Richter.\r\n\r\n“Was a little reminder that I sent through the boiler-room ventilator; I\r\nknew you were down there, Richter.”\r\n\r\nThe marine engineer switched on the electric light.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” he whined to Gathright.\r\n\r\n“Hylda—your daughter!”\r\n\r\nPaul Richter covered his eyes.\r\n\r\n“If she will atone for the harm I have done you, Gathright, she is yours\r\nwith her father’s blessing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Invisible Terror\r\n\r\n_An Uncanny Tale of the Jungle_\r\n\r\n_By_ HUGH THOMASON\r\n\r\n\r\nOld man Jess Benson, cattleman and mine owner, rode across the high\r\nplateau, which divided the rich grazing lands between Rock Valley and\r\nSlater Canyon, and let his horse pick its way down the steep slope to\r\nSlater Creek. Here, as the sorrel slaked its thirst, the big man in the\r\nsaddle filled and lighted his pipe, while his eyes roved slowly through\r\nthe sprinkle of cottonwoods which fringed the creek.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty feet upstream, close to a large bowlder and partly behind\r\na clump of stunted plum bushes, half a dozen magpies were quarreling\r\nover something that the rider could not clearly distinguish. He could\r\nmerely see a dark blotch behind the bushes—the carcass of a cow or steer\r\nprobably—and he watched the beautiful black-and-white birds speculatively\r\nas they uttered their shrill, raucous cries, and fluttered about the\r\nthicket.\r\n\r\nSince there was a possibility, however, that the dead animal might be\r\ncarrying his own brand, Benson finally turned his horse in the direction\r\nof the birds. Half a minute later, having reached a spot from which he\r\ncould command a clear view of the thing that lay behind the bushes, his\r\ntanned cheeks went ashen, and he swung himself to the ground with an\r\nexclamation of horrified surprise.\r\n\r\nClose to the thicket, and five or six feet from the rock, the body of a\r\nman was huddled in the horrible posture of one who has met a violent end.\r\n\r\nHe was lying partly on his side, one leg drawn up, the other\r\noutstretched, while both arms were bent under him. His face and neck were\r\nterribly torn and mangled, and his flannel shirt had been ripped half\r\noff his body, which was bruised and covered with wounds. Several paces\r\naway was a trampled felt hat, and the muzzle of a revolver peeped from\r\nbeneath the body, its butt evidently clutched in the stiffened fingers of\r\none hand. For a dozen feet the ground was torn and trampled, as though a\r\nterrible struggle had taken place.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes Benson stood still and eyed the ghastly thing in\r\nhorrified fascination. Long experience as a range rider told him that\r\nthe body and the signs of conflict about it could not be more than\r\nforty-eight hours old—the thing had happened since a heavy rain of two\r\ndays before—and it slowly dawned on the cattleman that the dead man was\r\nNathan Smith, a neighbor of his, who owned a small farm some five or six\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nFor some time he studied the body and the surrounding soil very\r\ncarefully, noting especially that the soft earth was covered with large,\r\ndoglike tracks; then he went to his horse and untied his slicker from the\r\nback of the saddle. With this garment he managed to cover the body so\r\nthat the magpies could no longer reach it. Then he mounted his horse and\r\nrode off toward Elktooth, ten miles away.\r\n\r\nSheriff Parker and Doctor Morse, the coroner, happened to be together\r\nin the latter’s office when Benson entered and told his story. Both men\r\nlistened without any particular comment, and at the end the sheriff got\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n“I’ll run you out in the car, Horace,” he informed the coroner. “We can\r\nreach the spot easily enough by following the old road up the creek. From\r\nwhat Benson says, the thing does not look like a crime exactly—it seems\r\nmore like the work of wolves, though I never heard of any attacking a man\r\nin this region; but you can never tell. At any rate, we’d better look\r\ninto it as soon as we can.”\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour later when the three men got out of the machine\r\nand walked the few feet which separated them from the scene of the\r\ntragedy. Lifting the slicker, Doctor Morse stooped over the gruesome\r\nobject beneath it, while Sheriff Parker gazed at the trodden ground with\r\ninterest. While the coroner made his examination, the little officer\r\npaced around the thicket, eying the tracks thoughtfully; more than once\r\nhe stooped to apply a pocket rule to some especially distinct impression,\r\nand twice he whistled softly to himself. By the time the doctor’s\r\nexamination had ended, he was turning a speculative eye toward a dim\r\ntrail which led off at right angles through the cottonwoods.\r\n\r\nReturning from washing his hands at the edge of the stream, Doctor Morse\r\nlooked at his friend in contemplative silence, as he lighted a cigar and\r\npuffed at it nervously.\r\n\r\n“Well?” the sheriff questioned, at length. “What was it? What killed him,\r\nHorace?”\r\n\r\n“Bless me if I know, Bert. I never saw anything like this before in all\r\nmy experience. It was an animal of some kind, I should say; a wolf,\r\nperhaps, although, as you said, the few wolves we have hereabouts have\r\nnever been known to attack humans. But the man is frightfully mangled,\r\nhis jugular vein is quite torn out of him. Had his gun in his hand,\r\ntoo. It’s empty. He must have fought the thing hard, whatever it was. I\r\nwonder—could it have been the ‘plague’?”\r\n\r\nSheriff Parker nodded in an absent way, his eyes still fixed on the faint\r\ntrail through the trees and weeds.\r\n\r\n“I think it was,” he said. “This spot is only a little way removed from\r\nwhere the creature has been in the habit of roaming, and poor Smith, I\r\nsuppose, was caught here after dark. These tracks match those we found\r\nnear Moore, and they look pretty fresh. How long should you say he has\r\nbeen dead?”\r\n\r\n“Killed early last night, I should judge,” was the doctor’s answer. “He\r\ndied hard, too, poor chap. Look at that ground.”\r\n\r\nJess Benson, with horror written all over his honest features, had been\r\nstaring at the two men as they talked. Big, burly, outdoor giant that he\r\nwas, he seemed to be in the grip of a kind of terror—or was it awe?—that\r\nmade him incapable of speech.\r\n\r\n“Heavens, what an end!” he burst out at length. “What are we going to do,\r\nsheriff? How’ll we ever get the thing that killed him?”\r\n\r\nSheriff Parker made no answer. He merely continued to search the ground\r\naround the body for a few minutes longer, as though he wished to make\r\ndoubly sure that his suspicions were correct; then he helped the others\r\nwrap the body in a blanket and stow it in the car. Five minutes later,\r\nsave for the trampled ground and some dull-brown, ominous stains on the\r\ngrass, there was no sign of the tragedy apparent.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, seated at his own desk with a cigar between his teeth,\r\nSheriff Parker squinted through his glasses at Doctor Morse, who sat\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, Horace,” the sheriff was saying, “it is such a thing as\r\nnever has been known before. If I had not been studying the results of\r\nthis creature’s work for the past six weeks, I could not believe that\r\nsuch a thing could be. Still, it _must_ be so! Poor Jack Moore, he was\r\nthe first victim; we were morally certain that the thing got him; then\r\nthat strange waving of the alfalfa in Pollard’s meadow, and now this. I\r\ntell you, it’s awful, Horace!”\r\n\r\n“It is; it’s more than that, Bert; it’s unnatural.” Doctor Morse puffed\r\njerkily at his cigar. “And yet, science tells us that there are sounds\r\nthe ear cannot detect, why not colors the eye cannot see? Take the only\r\ntime the beast, or the ‘plague,’ as we have begun to call it, appeared\r\nin daylight. I mean that uncanny agitation in Pollard’s hayfield that\r\nafternoon, when some heavy creature thrashed about there. It could be\r\nheard, and the alfalfa moved, but the thing itself could not be _seen_,\r\nthough three different people stood watching.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right, Horace; and I have already spent a great many\r\nsleepless nights milling over that ‘neutral color’ theory. Recently I\r\nhave read that at the end of the solar spectrum there are things known as\r\nactinic rays. They represent colors—integral colors in the composition\r\nof light—which we are unable to discern with the naked eye. The human\r\neye is, after all, an imperfect instrument. Undoubtedly there are colors\r\nwhich we cannot see, and this beast, this scourge of the neighborhood, is\r\nof some such color.”\r\n\r\n“Aside from its color,” the coroner mused, “the creature is tangible\r\nenough. It leaves a track in the ground larger by far than that of a\r\nfull-grown timber wolf, and it certainly can fight. Benson says his\r\nhounds were soundly thrashed by it last week, you know, and there is\r\nSmith. He was a very powerful man, and armed, but, so far as we know,\r\nthe thing killed him and got away unscathed. The man’s body looked as\r\nif it had been struck by a train. The chest and sides might have been\r\nbeaten in with a sledge, his clothes were torn to shreds, and as for his\r\nthroat—well, the less said about that the better.”\r\n\r\nSheriff Parker said nothing for several minutes. Getting to his feet, he\r\nbegan to pace slowly back and forth across the room, fingers interlaced\r\nbehind his back and head bowed in the way he sometimes affected when in\r\ndeep thought.\r\n\r\nHe was struggling with a problem the like of which he had never before\r\ntackled; and as he watched him, the coroner, in his turn, strove to\r\ndevise some method of wiping out the creature which was terrorizing the\r\nentire valley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost six weeks before, Jack Moore, a stock inspector, whose duties\r\noften carried him far out into the thinly settled portions of the\r\ncountry, had been found dead under circumstances similar in every way to\r\nthose surrounding Smith’s end.\r\n\r\nAt first, the authorities and general public had attributed the death\r\nto timber wolves, for the sole reason that they could attribute it to\r\nnothing else. The tracks about the body, though exceedingly large, were\r\nshaped like a wolf’s, and the body itself had been torn and mangled as by\r\nsome carniverous animal.\r\n\r\nSoon after Moore’s death came the killing of a dozen sheep in their\r\npasture, and, on the heels of this, Judson Pollard, a prosperous farmer\r\nwhose word was beyond dispute, with two of his hired men, had seen\r\nsomething rush through an alfalfa meadow—something that they could not\r\nmake out, though it was broad daylight, and they could see the tall hay\r\nwave and shake, and could even hear the creature as it thrashed about\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThen Jess Benson’s hounds, a pack of fourteen, which had never met its\r\nmatch in numerous encounters with wolves and coyotes, had been soundly\r\nwhipped, and three of its number killed outright in a fight with some\r\nanimal which their owner could not see, although he had witnessed the\r\nfight from a distance.\r\n\r\nNow, as a climax to the whole business, had come Nathan Smith’s horrible\r\ndeath; and no man could say who or what would be the next victim.\r\nNo wonder the entire county could talk of little else, and that the\r\ncreature, whatever it was, had been named the “plague”!\r\n\r\nAs he thought over all these things for the hundredth time, Sheriff\r\nParker cudgeled his brain in an effort to form some plan for trapping and\r\nkilling the beast. He knew that there must be a way, somehow, to make an\r\nend of the terror, even though the most skillful trappers and hunters in\r\nthe district had failed to discover it. The animal’s range was known. It\r\nseemed, for the most part, to frequent the country between Slater Creek\r\nand White Horse Mountain, probably because this region contained plenty\r\nof timber and natural shelter; and it was in this region that it must\r\nbe cornered. For many years the little sheriff had studied the crimes of\r\nmen, and few criminals had ever had just cause to boast of outwitting\r\nhim; but this was a different task.\r\n\r\n“Horace,” the sheriff burst out finally, coming to an abrupt halt in\r\nfront of his friend, “this butchery has gone far enough. We must put an\r\nend to it. What do you say to trying this very night? The beast seems to\r\nroam mostly at night, and tonight will be moonlight. We’ll try to trap it\r\nat the Black Pool.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Morse stared at the speaker in surprise.\r\n\r\n“The Black Pool?” he repeated. “Are you crazy, Bert? To be sure, we have\r\ndiscovered, so far as possible at any rate, that the beast seems to\r\nfrequent the pool more than any other one spot; but how can we trap it?\r\nThat has already been tried more than once.”\r\n\r\n“True, Horace; but we shall try in a different way. This thing, whatever\r\nit is, though it can’t be seen, can be felt and heard; therefore it must\r\nhave a solid body, so to speak. It leaves a distinct trail, you know, and\r\nits victims are proof enough that it is a creature of flesh and blood. My\r\nscheme is to _make_ it visible—then, if we are lucky, we can shoot it.”\r\n\r\nThe coroner jumped to his feet in his excitement.\r\n\r\n“I see what you mean!” he cried. “Why haven’t we thought of that before?\r\nBut how, Bert—how will you do it?”\r\n\r\n“That remains to be seen.” Sheriff Parker smiled oddly as he looked at\r\nhis companion. “If you are willing to risk the thing with me, I think I\r\nhave a plan that will work. We’ll leave here in the car about four this\r\nafternoon; that will get us to the pool in plenty of time to set our\r\ntrap before dark. Bring along your repeating shotgun—a heavy charge of\r\nbuckshot is far more certain after dark than a rifle ball, and we can’t\r\nafford to miss.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Morse nodded understandingly.\r\n\r\n“I shall not fail you, Bert,” he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly dusk found the two men in the sheriff’s car slowly picking their\r\nway over the stony trail which led to the Black Pool. In the bottom\r\nof the tonneau was a ten-gallon keg, three or four short boards, and\r\nsomething wrapped in burlap, while the back seat held a pair of repeating\r\nshot guns and a box of cartridges. A hundred yards from the pool, at the\r\nfoot of a little hill, Sheriff Parker killed his engine and stepped out\r\nonto the ground.\r\n\r\n“We’d better leave the car here,” he remarked. “It is best not to make\r\nany more disturbance in the immediate vicinity of the pool than we can\r\nhelp, and we can easily carry what we need from here. But let’s look\r\naround a bit first.”\r\n\r\nTogether, carrying their loaded guns in the manner of men who wish to\r\nbe prepared against any sudden emergency, they made their way through a\r\nfringe of trees to the edge of the black, still water, which gave the\r\npool its name. Even by daylight the place was far from cheerful. The\r\npool, about seventy feet in diameter, was entirely surrounded by trees\r\nwhich grew to within a few feet of its oily surface.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of life about the place, not even a frog croaked, and\r\nthe muddy banks bore mute testimony that none of the many cattle which\r\nroamed that region had been there to drink for many days. In one place\r\nonly was the mud broken by fresh tracks; and when his eyes fell on this\r\nspot, the sheriff smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n“You see them, Horace,” he said, pointing. “The thing has been here\r\nrecently—its trail is as plain as day; this must be its drinking place.\r\nNow for our little trap.”\r\n\r\nReturning to the car, the two men first carried the keg to the foot of\r\na large tree which stood only a few yards from where the “plague” had\r\napproached the pool; then they got the boards and the other articles,\r\nwhich, on being unwrapped, proved to be a brass hand pump, with a long\r\nspray nozzle, and about a dozen feet of hose.\r\n\r\nDoctor Morse regarded this contrivance with considerable perplexity. He\r\ncould not see of what use it could be in the task that lay ahead of them;\r\nbut when he expressed his puzzlement, his companion laughed softly.\r\n\r\n“It’s really very simple,” he explained, “although it is merely an\r\nexperiment of my own, and may not work as I hope it will. The keg is full\r\nof whitewash, and this pump will throw a steady stream for over thirty\r\nfeet. If we can get the brute within range, my idea is to spray him with\r\nwhitewash until we can see enough of him to shoot at. White always shows\r\nup fairly well in the dark. Catch the idea?”\r\n\r\nDoctor Morse gazed at his friend in surprised admiration for an instant;\r\nthen he impulsively caught his hand in a hard grip.\r\n\r\n“You’re a wonder, Bert!” he exclaimed. “I don’t see how you ever thought\r\nof it, but the scheme looks good to me. I am honestly beginning to think\r\nwe have a chance. But what are those boards for?”\r\n\r\n“For a platform on the tree yonder,” replied the sheriff, nodding toward\r\na cotton wood. “For obvious reasons I thought it would be safer to do\r\nour watching from above ground, and with these boards we can construct\r\na support that will enable us to stay in the tree with some degree of\r\nsafety. Of course, the thing may be able to climb, for all we know, but\r\nwe must chance that. The tree is within easy range of the water, and\r\nthose tall ferns and weeds, if we watch them closely, should give us\r\nwarning of the beast’s approach. Now let’s get busy, for it will be dark\r\nbefore we know it.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour, just as it was actually growing dark within\r\nthe shadows of the trees, the two men had built a substantial platform in\r\na fork of the cottonwood, some ten feet from the ground, and established\r\nthemselves upon it. Sheriff Parker’s gun lay beside him, while he grasped\r\nthe nozzle of the high-pressure pump in his hands; but the coroner’s\r\nweapon was ready for instant use.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the day turned into night, and for an hour it was as dark as\r\npitch at the edge of the pool; then the moon, surrounded by myriads of\r\nstars, slowly climbed up over the hill-tops beyond the water. With eyes\r\nriveted upon the ferns, from the movements of which they expected to be\r\nwarned of the beast’s approach, the two men waited tensely.\r\n\r\nFor a long time nothing happened. From the blank darkness around them\r\ncame merely the familiar noises of night in the wilderness—the long,\r\nwailing howl of a distant coyote; the chirping drone of the tireless\r\ninsects in the trees; strange cries of night birds, so different from\r\nthose of the birds of the day; the “plop” of muskrats diving in the still\r\nwater, and all the mysterious chorus of small sounds that one never\r\nnotices until after night has fallen.\r\n\r\nSeated on their narrow platform, the watchers were soon very\r\nuncomfortable, for the mosquitoes were numerous and hungry, and the men\r\ndared not smoke for fear the smell of tobacco would give warning to the\r\nthing they sought. Doctor Morse, eyes fixed on the top of a ridge which\r\ncould be seen through a break in the trees, and beyond which the stars\r\nand the moon seemed to be grouped, was half dozing, when suddenly he\r\nstraightened up with a little start.\r\n\r\nA curious thing had taken place! The stars, rising above the crest of the\r\nridge, _had successively disappeared from right to left_!\r\n\r\nEach was blotted out for but an instant, and not more than two or three\r\nat the same time, but along half the length of the ridge, all that were\r\nwithin a few degrees of the crest were eclipsed. Something had passed\r\nalong between them and the coroner’s line of vision; but he could not see\r\nit, and the stars were not close enough together to define its shape.\r\nAfter a second of tense watching, Doctor Morse reached out and gripped\r\nthe sheriff by the arm.\r\n\r\n“Did you see it?” he whispered. “It’s coming, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but be quiet, for your life!” Sheriff Parker leaned forward and\r\nshifted his grip on the hose nozzle.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes all was silent, then came a faint patter of stealthy\r\nfeet, and something like the sniffing of a hound sounded below them,\r\nwhile the ferns waved violently, although there was no breeze. Almost\r\nimmediately came the sounds of lapping in the water—sounds exactly like\r\nthose made by a thirsty dog when drinking.\r\n\r\nTaking careful aim with the nozzle, Sheriff Parker suddenly pumped out\r\na steady stream of whitewash which began to splash and spatter on the\r\nedge of the pool and surface of the water. And, as the milky liquid\r\nbegan to fall, the two watchers saw a strange and wonderful thing. In\r\na spot, which ten seconds before had been merely opaque darkness, _an\r\noutline grew up and took shape out of the ground_; a strange, monstrous,\r\nmisshapen thing, squat and hairy, not unlike a huge wolf in general\r\nappearance, but broader and more powerful than any wolf either man had\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nFor an instant after the whitewash began to fall upon it, the thing\r\nturned a big-jawed, hairy face in the direction of the tree; then, with a\r\nhorrible snarl of fury, which both men plainly heard, it charged toward\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Shoot! _Shoot_, Horace!” Sheriff Parker yelled, dropping the useless\r\nnozzle and grabbing his gun.\r\n\r\nThe two heavy guns, charged with double loads of buckshot, roared out\r\nalmost together. There was a coughing snarl from the thing on the ground,\r\nwhich save for a white patch or two, was almost invisible again, and the\r\nsound of convulsive struggling; then the sheriff fired a second time.\r\nAlmost immediately there was a heavy splash in the water; then absolute\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nDoctor Morse wiped the cold sweat from his forehead with a shaking hand.\r\n\r\n“Did we get it?” he asked in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’m almost sure of it.” Sheriff Parker, though tremendously\r\nexcited, began to lower himself to the ground. “No animal of the wolf\r\ntype could stand up against three charges of buckshot at less than a\r\ndozen yards,” he declared. “I believe it is dead, Horace.”\r\n\r\nWhen they warily approached the edge of the pool, however, the two\r\nmen could find no sign of the thing they had shot at, beyond a number\r\nof footprints in the soft ground, and, in one spot, very close to the\r\nwater, a large splotch of crimson, which made the little sheriff chuckle\r\nexultantly.\r\n\r\n“He was hard hit, and he’s sunk in the pool,” he declared positively,\r\n“sunk in water that no man has ever yet found the bottom of—a fitting\r\nend for such a beast, although I won’t deny that I should have enjoyed\r\na close look at the body. But it’s too late now, and, at any rate, the\r\nbrute is dead. Let’s be getting home, Horace.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeek Solution To Sahara Desert Mystery\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attempt is being made this Spring to penetrate the heart of the great\r\nSahara Desert and solve the mystery that envelops the savage Tribe of\r\nTauregx, a band of wild Arabs who have never recognized any civilized\r\nauthority. Both men and women members of the tribe always keep their\r\nfaces veiled in black. The region where they dwell is known as the Land\r\nof Terror. The Chicago Tribune organized the expedition, which is making\r\nthe 2,000-mile journey across the hot sands on camels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLight is the fastest-moving thing in the universe.

We operate for it as\r\nmany as a hundred times a year at the hospital.”\r\n\r\nDonaldson rose slowly to his feet.\r\n\r\n“I’ll let you know sometime soon,” he said, staring about him vaguely.\r\n\r\n“All right. But I’d advise you to have it done quickly.”\r\n\r\nDonaldson shuffled toward the door.\r\n\r\n“I’ll let you know,” he murmured, and went out.\r\n\r\nHe descended to the street. He was a man of average height, and rather\r\nthin. He was dressed respectably in clothes of a few years back, but\r\nstill good. One felt that he was careful of them, timidly careful.\r\nHis blue eyes wandered in odd moments from one object to another, and\r\nhis thin lips tried to maintain a firm line, but drooped weakly, if,\r\nperchance, he forgot. Then he twitched them up, reining them hard, trying\r\nto appear casual, indifferent. But his step would drop into its habitual\r\nshort uncertainty, his shoulders slump down a bit, his eyes begin their\r\ncovert roving, his whole figure expressing a desire to occupy as small a\r\nspace as possible, as though his soul and body were squeezed in with a\r\nwish to be inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nAs he emerged from the doctor’s office, his pale eyes shifted as he\r\ngazed at the moving throng on the street. Why couldn’t it have been some\r\none else? Here they were, all so gay, so unconscious of him and the\r\nshadow that hung over him. Unconscious! That was the word which had so\r\nterrified his mind for ten long years. And that was what the anesthetic\r\nmeant—unconsciousness!\r\n\r\nDonaldson threaded his way along and turned into a little side street\r\nuntil he came to his house. He let himself in with his key. The bare\r\nhall resounded dismally to his footsteps. The gaunt, shadowy room gave\r\nhim only a chilly welcome. When Mrs. Saunders had kept house for him, it\r\nhad been more cheerful. There was not that deathlike stillness when he\r\ncame in. That had been several years ago, and since then his fear had\r\nincreased through long keeping, like some great, lank brute, gnawing in\r\nthe darkness. It was a sly, suspicious fear that shunned companionship.\r\nHe had lived for ten years all alone, except for Mrs. Saunders, the\r\nhousekeeper, but finally even her presence had become too much, and he\r\nhad sent her away.\r\n\r\nHe began stupidly preparing dinner. There was some ham, cheese, a half\r\nloaf of bread, and a few potatoes which he peeled, standing by the sink.\r\nThere was also a small pie that one of the neighbors had sent him a few\r\ndays ago. Kindly people they were, unable to understand Donaldson’s\r\nsolitary life, and who took pity on him and occasionally sent him little\r\nbits of pastry or jelly to freshen his meal.\r\n\r\nOnce, when he was sick with a cold, the husband had brought him over half\r\na tumbler of whisky, but Donaldson had shuddered and held up his arms as\r\nif to ward off the other, crying, “None of that! Go away! Let me alone!”\r\n\r\nAnd the neighbor had withdrawn, attributing this strange behavior to the\r\nsickness. But no, Donaldson’s fear of whisky was almost equal to that of\r\nthe beastlike fear that dogged his footsteps or lurked in the shadows\r\nahead of him.\r\n\r\nEver since that terrible, unforgettable night when he had drunk it for\r\nthe first and last time, he had had a wild terror of it. Even the sight\r\nof it recalled more vividly the white, strained face of his wife as she\r\nfell to the floor, and the red mark of the fender across her temple.\r\nHe remembered how he had gone away and brought Jack Dingler home with\r\nhim a few hours later, and they had found her. The neighbors had been\r\nso sympathetic toward him in his calamity. Even the same neighbors that\r\nbrought him the whisky and went home saying sorrowfully, “Poor Mr.\r\nDonaldson. He’s never been quite himself since the missus was murdered.\r\nIt seems to have turned his mind.”\r\n\r\nThey were right. His mind was turned. John Donaldson knew what it was\r\nto be afraid. For ten terrible years, fear had skulked behind him. His\r\ncomposure and his self-reliance vanished. He had become a coward with\r\nthe ever-present fear that in some way, by some word or action, he would\r\nreveal his secret. He had kept ever alert. Fear, the driving power that\r\nwould not let him slumber. He always kept his door bolted at night, and\r\nthe room next to his empty, for fear that he might talk in his sleep.\r\n\r\nThat was his greatest dread, that sometime, in an unconscious state, he\r\nwould talk. He learned to take the greatest precautions in regard to his\r\npersonal safety. He never went on long journeys, nor took an unnecessary\r\nrisk. And now—appendicitis!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne night, a week later, Donaldson woke up with a start, his body wet\r\nwith perspiration. He had been dreaming a terrible dream. It seemed as\r\nthough he saw the white face of his wife with the red mark across the\r\ntemple, only she was standing up and looking at him with an unfamiliar,\r\nghastly expression in her eyes, and behind her, looking over her\r\nshoulder, was a satyr’s face, long and yellow.\r\n\r\nThen this figure stepped out and came toward him, holding chains in its\r\nhands. Chains for him, Donaldson! He had had dreams like this before,\r\nvarying slightly in detail sometimes, but always with the same terrible\r\nsuggestion. And always he had waked up as he did now, wet and cold, with\r\nthe same monstrous fear clutching him, pricking him like a thousand\r\nneedles, drawing up his flesh, paralyzing him with a queer, uncanny\r\nthrill.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if he had talked in his sleep. Of course, there was no one to\r\nhear, still he wondered. It was something he could never know, an awful,\r\nthreatening uncertainty that hung over him, that would always hang over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd those chains! He had a mental vision of himself in the penal stone\r\nquarries, chained to an iron ball.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. It was later than he had thought—six o’clock.\r\nHe got out of bed and dressed quickly. He knew from experience the only\r\nway to work off the stultifying effect of his dreams. It was physical\r\naction, to walk and walk until he tired himself out. Then his mind would\r\nbe loosed from this crazy, nervous terror, and he would relapse into the\r\nsteady, dogged fear from which he knew no respite.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and stepped into the street. The morning sun was\r\nbeginning to lighten the grey, deserted court. Some one across the way\r\nclosed a window. Donaldson straightened up, tightening his lips. Even\r\nthis early they might see him. He must appear casual, like a man of\r\nleisure out for a morning stroll.\r\n\r\nBut it was an effort, for an unreasoning fear possessed him. He wanted to\r\nrun. Something behind him seemed to urge his footsteps faster. It seemed\r\nto him that his feet actually were going faster than the rest of his\r\nbody, as though they obeyed the will of that something behind him, while\r\nhe himself was really moving only at a moderate gait.\r\n\r\nHe had a detached sense of two entities. One was John Donaldson as he\r\nappeared to the world, a slender, inconspicuous man, walking somewhat\r\ntimidly along the street, and the other was the coward, the terrified\r\nbeing, running from the thing that followed him; alert, cunning to\r\noutwit his pursuer. Once, from an irresistible impulse, he dodged into\r\nan alley-way. Then, suddenly ashamed and realizing, he came out again,\r\nwalking boldly, his eyes fixed on a passing horse, trying to appear\r\nunconcerned.\r\n\r\nToward noon he returned, and, remembering he had had no breakfast and\r\nthat there was nothing to eat in the house, stopped at the corner grocery\r\nstore. The grocer was waiting on another customer when Donaldson came in,\r\nbut he looked up and nodded.\r\n\r\n“Be with you in a minute, Mr. Donaldson.” And then, “Why, what’s the\r\nmatter? Are you sick?”\r\n\r\nDonaldson had sat down suddenly on a flour-barrel, clutching his side,\r\nhis face gone grey with pain. The grocer ran to get a glass of water.\r\n\r\n“Here, better drink this! What’s the matter? Can I help you?”\r\n\r\nBut Donaldson only shook his head over his knees, unable to speak. They\r\ngot him home a little later, when the pain had eased a little, and sent a\r\ndoctor in to see him. Donaldson did not want a doctor, but the grocer was\r\nfrightened by his pale face and paid no attention to his protests.\r\n\r\nThe verdict was what Donaldson had anticipated, appendicitis and the\r\nnecessity of an immediate operation. He heard it, lying on the bed, from\r\na strange doctor, with a feeling, in spite of the pain in his side, that\r\nit must be another man under sentence. He could not take that anesthetic!\r\nThe pain might kill him; then let him die! It would be better than\r\nthose awful chains. For he knew that once unconscious, the truth would\r\ncome out, that all the poison which had been maddening him for years\r\nwould flow from his lips in self-exposure, once he was placed under an\r\nanesthetic. How many times had he already related it in the stillness of\r\nthe night? What of his secret could the walls of his room not tell? They\r\nmust have heard it over and over.\r\n\r\nThe doctor repeated his statement and Donaldson nodded.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said mechanically. He must appease this man, lest a refusal\r\nmake him too insistent. When the doctor was gone, he was safe again. He\r\nwould get well. Everybody had these attacks; they meant nothing.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be back to see you tonight,” said the doctor, as he prepared to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Donaldson, “don’t come. I’ll be all right.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be here,” answered the doctor, and went out.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great fatigue came over the sick man, an overwhelming\r\ndrowsiness, a desire for sleep, one of the primal, insistent, compelling\r\nthings that would not be denied.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was quite dark. He did not know the time. Lights shone\r\nin the houses across the street. The ticking of the clock was the only\r\nnoise to be heard. The darkness of the room seemed palpable, as though\r\nit floated over and around him, breathing. Then the clock struck eight.\r\nDonaldson remembered. The doctor was coming back. He might return any\r\nminute. Only he must not! There were footsteps on the walk. It was he,\r\nand the door was unlocked! Donaldson rose and started toward it. He had\r\nforgotten his side. He was only conscious of a difficulty in moving, like\r\nin a nightmare, as though weights were dragging on his feet. The doctor\r\nwas on the porch. Donaldson struggled. What was holding his feet?\r\n\r\n“Don’t come in,” he gasped. “I’m all right!”\r\n\r\nThen came the pain, like a sudden knife-blade, piercing him. He screamed,\r\none awful, uncontrollable yell, and pitched forward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a queer, unfamiliar smell, and stillness. Not the empty\r\nstillness of his own house, but the stillness of human beings and hushed\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nNausea possessed him. He opened his eyes for a moment and then closed\r\nthem. He was in a white-walled room, darkened. Against the drawn blind he\r\ncould feel the sunlight beating. A ray of it came in between the shade\r\nand the window-jamb and struck the opposite wall. It was broad day.\r\nSuddenly, quick and clear as an arrow released from a taut bow-string,\r\nDonaldson’s mind leaped up into consciousness.\r\n\r\nHe was in a hospital, and it was over—the operation. It was the\r\nanesthetic which had nauseated him. What had he said? Had he betrayed\r\nhimself? Yet here he was, lying quietly in this room. However, they\r\ncouldn’t take him away while he was sick.\r\n\r\nThey were waiting—waiting till he got well to put the chains on him! He\r\nknew it. That was why they were so quiet, not to make him suspicious. He\r\nwould ask the nurse. She could tell him whether he had talked.\r\n\r\nBut the nurse was not there. She did not know he was awake. Well, he\r\nwould wait and ask her. Maybe he hadn’t talked. People didn’t always. The\r\nsun streamed against the blind. Light, hope! It might be that he would\r\nsee it again, free! That he would walk along the streets in the open day.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and the nurse entered. She came to his bedside. He would\r\nsmile at her easily, indifferently. She would think his question a casual\r\none.\r\n\r\n“Nurse,” he began. His voice sounded far away, weaker than it should have.\r\n\r\nThe nurse smiled. “How is my patient? Feeling better?”\r\n\r\n“Nurse,” he strove valiantly to make his voice strong, casual. He even\r\nsmiled weakly. “Did I—er—talk under the ether?”\r\n\r\n“No, not a word. Now rest quietly and I’ll come back after a while.” And\r\nshe went out.\r\n\r\nDonaldson sighed. He was still safe. She had told him so. She would not\r\ndeceive a sick man. And yet—wouldn’t she? He remembered reading somewhere\r\nthat patients were always told they had not talked, lest the knowledge\r\nexcite them and hinder their recovery.\r\n\r\nThat was why she had said it. They wanted him to get well, so they could\r\nput the chains on him. Hadn’t she hesitated a bit before she answered? He\r\nhad thought she looked at him a bit suspiciously. Now he was sure of it.\r\nAnd that was why. They didn’t want him to know they knew. They wanted to\r\nbe sure they’d get him.\r\n\r\nJust then Donaldson’s thoughts were interrupted by a noise on the street.\r\nSome vehicle clattering over the pavement and the sound of a bell. The\r\ndoor was standing slightly ajar. Two nurses were passing in the hall, and\r\nDonaldson’s straining ear caught their voices:\r\n\r\n“What is all the noise about?” asked one.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” replied the other. “It sounds like a police patrol.”\r\n\r\nThey were after him! What should he do? He threw back the bedclothes. His\r\nmind was working like lightning. They would never get him. He slipped to\r\nthe floor. How he got to the door he never knew. Fear lends strength. He\r\nclosed it and stumbled back across the floor, half-falling against the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nHe knew what he was going to do. He pulled up the bed-clothes from the\r\nfoot of the bed with feverish haste. The sheet—that was what he wanted!\r\nHe ripped open the hem a few inches, turning it back so that he could get\r\nthe raw edge of the material. Then he tore off a strip the whole length\r\nof the sheet. He laughed excitedly. They’d never get him!\r\n\r\nBy this time, the cut in his side had re-opened, but he did not notice\r\nit. He knew nothing but his one mad purpose. His senses seemed to have\r\ndeserted him. It was as though he were in a dream. He felt as though\r\nhis mind were standing off, directing his body to do these things, and\r\nas though he were putting a senseless and inanimate other half of him\r\nthrough certain prescribed motions.\r\n\r\nHe tied one end of the strip to one of the iron bed-posts, then he\r\nclimbed into bed and lay down. He circled the other end of the strip\r\naround his neck. The head of the bed was looped between the posts with\r\nscrolls of white iron-work. He lifted his knees and pushed with his feet\r\ntill his head was through one of these openings, hanging down in the\r\nspace between the bed and the corner of the room. His neck was now in a\r\nstraight line between the bed-posts, bent backward, and as he breathed,\r\nhe emitted from his lips little hoarse noises that seemed to struggle out\r\nprotestingly from his strained throat. He knew that he could not strangle\r\nhimself to death, for as soon as unconsciousness came, he would relax his\r\nhold. If he could tie the other end! That was sure and safe.\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to his head. He pulled the knot tight, very tight, and\r\ngasped. He felt as though he were drowning. His temples throbbed, and his\r\nears beat as though the waves were knocking against the inside of his\r\nhead, now roaring, now singing with queer, unearthly hum. He relaxed his\r\nhand, and the noose slackened.\r\n\r\nThere! That was not so bad, but the blood rushed back from his brain, and\r\nthe waves swirled around him now and made him fearfully dizzy. He felt\r\nlike a little brig, tossed in the valley of a tempestuous sea, beaten,\r\ndazed, apathetic.\r\n\r\nHe recovered somewhat. The police! They must be on their way up! The\r\nwaves were calling. Their restless surging hammered upon his brain,\r\ndulling its sensibility. There was peace beneath those waves. Unchanging\r\npeace!\r\n\r\nBut he must hurry. A cloud rose before his eyes, grey and inviting. He\r\nseemed to forget. What was he going to do? Where was that peace? Peace,\r\nsomething he had not known for aeons, aching, endless aeons of time.\r\nWhere was it? Ah, yes! Beneath the waves, those heaving, restless,\r\ninsistent waves.\r\n\r\n“I’m coming,” he murmured thickly. His tongue seemed swollen. There was\r\nneed of haste. He shook himself to clear his mind for the final effort.\r\nThen he pulled the noose tight with all his strength, and tied it quickly\r\nto the right-hand bedpost.\r\n\r\nThe waves seemed to open and he was going down. He saw a faint,\r\nopalescent light beneath him. There was something precious down there. It\r\nwas peace.\r\n\r\n“I’m coming,” he muttered, struggling, his arms stretched out toward it.\r\n“I’m coming!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIREN\r\n\r\n_A Storiette That Is “Different”_\r\n\r\n_By_ TARLETON COLLIER\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an abrupt jerk, Joe Wilson, from lying on a cot in the little\r\ntent, lifted himself on his elbow in an attitude of intent listening.\r\nThere was no sound except the hum of a sleepy breeze through the pines,\r\nthe sleepier contralto of a mocking bird, and the purring undertone of\r\nrippling water.\r\n\r\n“That’s her!” he whispered. With an effort he sat erect, and again told\r\nhimself: “That’s her!”\r\n\r\nAll at once there came the crackle of voices without, the sound of\r\nthudding footsteps. Joe flung himself back on the cot and closed his eyes\r\nwith furious energy as the flap of the tent was lifted and the engineer\r\nand the doctor peered within.\r\n\r\n“He’s asleep,” said the engineer in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“_Hm!_” said the doctor. He was a wizened little man with spectacles.\r\nThen he let the flap drop, and his voice came to Joe brusquely through\r\nthe canvas. “Well, we’ll come back. I want to talk to him. He’s probably\r\nnot very sick, but—by God, man, you’ve got to keep your men from the\r\nwater around here, or you’ll never finish your railroad!”\r\n\r\nThey were walking away as he spoke, and to Joe the voice seemed to fade.\r\n\r\n“I tell you ... polluted ... fever....”\r\n\r\nThen they were gone, the sound of them swallowed up in the ripple of the\r\nlittle creek over the rocks. With a start, Joe again was erect, his eyes\r\nfurtive, glancing about the little canvas chamber. He tiptoed to the\r\nflap, and lifted it a bare inch, peering out upon the receding figures of\r\nthe two men as they passed beneath a water-oak.\r\n\r\nWith no less caution he crept to the other end of the tent, and stepped\r\nthrough the flap into the open. For a moment he stood irresolute, his\r\neyes closed, as if he were dizzy.\r\n\r\n“Keep away from the water, you fool!” he whispered.\r\n\r\nThere was no other sound of life in the woods now; the breeze had died\r\nand the mocking bird was silent. Only the prattle of a nearby stream over\r\nits rocky bed....\r\n\r\nWith a stumbling, nervous stride that was almost a run, Joe Wilson went\r\ntoward the sound of the water, and at last he plunged through a thick\r\nclump of willows and stood stiff, half-crouching, at the top of a bank of\r\ndamp green moss that sloped steeply to a little stream with pools like\r\nblack wells, still and silent. Only the silver shallows between pools\r\nrippled with life.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the bank was a shelf of rock, splotched green with moss,\r\nreaching into the stream barely an inch above the water. Upon it Joe’s\r\nglance rested, as if held by a power outside himself. He drew back into\r\nthe willows, his sunken eyes closed in his pale face; then, with a sudden\r\nspring, he was over the bank and perched upon the rock.\r\n\r\nSomething like a smile lighted his face, as if with the leap he had\r\nsettled a troublesome matter. He sat down as easily and comfortably as he\r\nmight, his legs doubled, his hands clasped about his knees; and stared\r\nintently into the black pool at his feet.\r\n\r\nAnd then, between a closing and an opening of his eyes, a woman was there\r\nwhere he had looked for her.\r\n\r\nThere was no sense of suddenness about the apparition; only, when he\r\nclosed his eyes against a dizziness, there was the water and nothing\r\nelse; when he opened them, an instant later, she was standing in the\r\nmidst of the pool, almost where he could touch her. And it was as if she\r\nhad been there all the while.\r\n\r\nThe water reached a little above her ankles. Her legs were bare to the\r\nknees, clothed above that, and her body as well, in a soft clinging\r\ngarment of white that seemed a part of her; white throat and arms were\r\nbare. Her face was alive with a pleasant smile; her eyes, of green and\r\ngray together, were alive and pleasant, too.\r\n\r\n“You are late,” she said. There was something of the stream’s bright\r\nripple in her voice.\r\n\r\nJoe Wilson could only smile, in answer; then his smile faded and his face\r\nwas scornful and somewhat stubborn.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “and I came near not coming at all. I swore I wouldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“But you came,” she said, still smiling.\r\n\r\n“Only to tell you that this is the last time.”\r\n\r\nHer smile, merrier now, was accompanied by a sound that might have been\r\nthe gurgle of a little whirlpool in the rapids, or it might have been a\r\nlow note of laughter.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t mean it, then, that you love me,” she chided, coming nearer.\r\nIt was not by a step that she moved, or by any perceptible effort. The\r\nspace between them all at once was lessened, nothing else.\r\n\r\nJoe had lost his careless air and posture. He was on his knees, a fury in\r\nhis words.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean it? You can’t say that. I have become less than a man, I\r\nlove you so. You bring me here every day to do as you will, and I would\r\ndie if I didn’t come, I love you so. For you I have broken my word to my\r\nfriends back there in camp. And I don’t know who you are or _what_ you\r\nare.”\r\n\r\nAgain that gentle sound that might have been a sudden swirl of the water,\r\nor her laughter. Then she was nearer, and her pleasant eyes looked into\r\nhis, mockery in them.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know who I am?” she asked softly. “And yet I am yours.”\r\n\r\nThe stubborn lines in Joe’s face vanished. A quick throb of blood choked\r\ninto a gulp the word he would have spoken, and he stretched out his arms.\r\nShe was suddenly beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n“Yours,” she said again, and that she laughed there was no doubt this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nJoe’s eyes were hungry. Joe leaned forward upon his stiffened arms, and\r\nstared at her like a wistful dog.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know who you are,” he whispered. “I don’t know who you are.”\r\n\r\n“I am whoever you want me to be,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I’ll call you Sadie,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Sadie?” Her lids drooped, veiling her eyes, but their narrow glimmer was\r\nkeenly alive.\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is a girl—”\r\n\r\nBetween two words she was close before him at the edge of the rock.\r\n\r\n“I am yours,” she said in a fierce, low voice. “What do you care for any\r\ngirl? I am all woman, and you have me. What do you care for the world?\r\nYou have me.”\r\n\r\nHe felt her breath on his face. There was warmth and fragrance in it.\r\nHer white beauty was greater than that of the dogwood blossoms showering\r\nthere through the gloom under a sudden breeze; and a dizziness struck\r\nhim, so that the trees swam before his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I have you,” he repeated thickly, rising to his feet.\r\n\r\n“And the girl ... Sadie?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“You are Sadie. Only you. I have forgotten....” He put out his arms, but\r\nshe was beyond his reach again, her eyes mysterious.\r\n\r\nWith outstretched arms, he begged her to return.\r\n\r\n“I love you,” he said.\r\n\r\nFor a full breath she looked at him gravely. Then, “We shall see,” she\r\nsaid, plunging her hands into the stream. As she arose, her hands were\r\ncupped and brimming with water. She moved toward him, smiling.\r\n\r\nTerror gathered in Joe’s white face.\r\n\r\n“Drink,” she tempted him.\r\n\r\nHe whispered “No,” and the refusal seemed to strengthen him, for when she\r\nsaid again, “Drink,” he shouted it: “_No!_”\r\n\r\nShe dropped her hands, and the water went splashing back into the stream;\r\nand, smiling still, she came nearer until she was beside him upon the\r\nrock, her wet feet glistening silver upon its greenish-brown surface. Her\r\neyes held fast his wide, frightened stare.\r\n\r\n“Why?” she asked him, when she was so close that he was aware of the\r\nwarmth and fragrance of her person.\r\n\r\nHe answered her steadily:\r\n\r\n“I will not, that’s why. I must not. I have told you I must not, every\r\nday that I have come here, and yet I have always drunk this water. It has\r\nmade me less than a man. It has made me break my word and my own rules.”\r\n\r\nOnce more her eyes were grave. “You must not?” she asked. Her voice might\r\nhave been that of the purring shallows. There was no escaping her gaze,\r\nand before it his eyes wavered and shifted. His shoulders drooped.\r\n\r\n“You will not?” the purring voice went on. “Not for me, and you say you\r\nlove me? It is so little that I ask.”\r\n\r\nThere was pain in his voice as he cried, “Don’t ... Sadie! I have\r\npromised ... the rule....”\r\n\r\nIt was she whose figure drooped now, and her face that was mournful. “But\r\nyou have broken the rules before this for me,” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“I came today to say that I would no more.”\r\n\r\n“But it is so little I ask. And I—am—yours.”\r\n\r\nHe pleaded: “_Don’t!_”\r\n\r\nWith sudden abandon, she flung herself against him, and for the first\r\ntime his arms closed about her. She yielded to his fierce embrace, her\r\nhead against his breast.\r\n\r\n“You do not love me,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“Sadie...!” His arms tightened with his cry, and a red mist blinded him\r\nas he felt her warm, vital body closer against him.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her face and looked at him.\r\n\r\n“You will?” she asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, almost with a moan.\r\n\r\nShe kissed him. “To drink, only to drink,” she said softly. “It is so\r\nlittle. I have given you myself ... isn’t that something?”\r\n\r\nWith one arm she clung to him as tightly as he held her; the other arm\r\nwas free, and with her hand she stroked his face. Her kisses were hot\r\nupon his lips. His eyes were closed, and he swayed with a dizziness that\r\nwas mightier than any other he had known.\r\n\r\n“Only to drink,” she said. “Do you not care for me, and I have given you\r\nmyself? What are those men in the camp to you, they and their rules? You\r\nwill not drink ... yet I give you ... this....”\r\n\r\nHer lips met his in an eternity of giving and taking.\r\n\r\n“No!” he said again, but his voice quivered and broke, with the plain\r\nmessage of surrender.\r\n\r\nWith a little cry, she knelt at the edge of the pool, her arms still\r\nabout him so that he was forced to kneel with her. She plunged her hands\r\ninto the water, and lifted them to him with their silver freight.\r\n\r\nWith an eager, moaning sound, he drank the cool water; and as he did so\r\nthe red mist before his eyes thickened, and his ears roared with the\r\nthunder of blood within. To drink became then his passion, and he cupped\r\nhis own hands, filled them with water, and drank.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the mist cleared and the roaring ceased, and he saw that he\r\nwas alone on the rock.\r\n\r\n“Sadie!” he called.\r\n\r\nThe answering sound might have been only the prattle of the stream, or it\r\nmight have been low laughter.\r\n\r\nThe thought came to him that perhaps she had fled to the bank, and with\r\nprodigious labor he clambered up the tiny slope. She was not there. He\r\nparted the soft-flowing curtain of the willows, and though the fronds\r\nwere so light a bird might have flown through them, he gasped with the\r\neffort it cost him.\r\n\r\nStaggering into the sunlight beyond the fringe of trees, he found that\r\nshe was not there, either. He tried to run, but only stumbled, lifting\r\nhimself painfully to stagger onward. Then the mist of his delirium closed\r\nupon him, and the blood at his ear drums pounded and a tumult came out of\r\nearth and sky to overwhelm him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe doctor and engineer, going fishing, stumbled upon his crumpled form\r\nan hour later. The former, a wizened, spectacled little man, bent over\r\nhim and studied him with eyes that seemed to see everything. He studied\r\nthe young fellow’s pulse, loosened his shirt, stared into the pupils of\r\nhis eyes. At last he turned to the other, frowning, and said:\r\n\r\n“Fever, and maybe that damn’ typhoid. He’s the sickest man I ever saw.”\r\n\r\nThen his voice rose with a flare of anger.\r\n\r\n“Say, can’t you keep these fools away from this water?” he asked.\r\n“There’s death in it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMen, Lost at Sea, Live Through Week of Horror\r\n\r\n\r\nA harrowing adventure that probably will never leave their minds befell\r\ntwo fishermen of Freeport, L. I., who passed a week in the open sea in\r\na small motor boat, without water or provisions. Caught in a blizzard\r\noff the Long Island coast, something went wrong with their compass and\r\nthey headed out to sea, where they drifted for nearly a week before the\r\nschooner, Catherine M., saw their signals of distress and picked them\r\nup. The two men—Capt. Bergen Smith and Harry Matthews—had only a small\r\nsupply of water and a few raw potatoes. On this they lived for the first\r\ntwo days. Then Matthews lost control of himself, drank sea water and\r\nbecame delirious. Raving in delirium, he urged Smith to split a bottle of\r\niodine in a suicide pact. Their boat began to leak, and they ripped the\r\nlining from their overcoats to calk the seams. Finally, after a number of\r\nships had passed without seeing them, they were rescued, more dead than\r\nalive, by the schooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Night of Horror in the Mortuary_\r\n\r\nTHE MADMAN\r\n\r\n_By_ HERBERT HIPWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Stubbs has snow-white hair, and he is only twenty-eight. He mutters\r\nto himself as he pursues his lowly task of sweeping the streets in our\r\nlittle university town. Children gibe at him and goad him to rage and\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nPeter once had raven black hair and was as fine and strong a young fellow\r\nas ever led the town forces in their frequent battles with our students.\r\nThat was before the one night he spent as caretaker of our medical\r\nschool. Only two of us know the real story of that night and why Peter\r\nwas taken from the building next morning, a gibbering and white-haired\r\nidiot.\r\n\r\nWe have remained silent for various and selfish reasons, but I can no\r\nlonger keep to myself the story of that awful night.\r\n\r\nOur medical college is a lonely, ramshackle old building. The town\r\nhas grown away from it. It is surrounded by musty old junk yards and\r\ninfrequently used railway sidings, and it is miles from the fine old\r\ngroup of buildings which form the rest of the university.\r\n\r\nThere has always been difficulty in getting a suitable caretaker for it.\r\nNone of the many engaged could be relied on to come early enough to get\r\nthe fires going properly and to keep the walks clear of snow. Our new\r\ndean, Dr. Towney, thought he had solved the problem by deciding to have a\r\ncaretaker live permanently on the premises.\r\n\r\nPeter Stubbs, on learning of this, applied for the post and had no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining it. The dean showed him around the building and\r\nexplained the duties required of him. A more imaginative man might have\r\nbeen a little chilled by the gaunt skeletons arranged in the cases of\r\nsome of our classrooms. Certainly he would not have been pleased with\r\nthe sleeping quarters picked out for him. The only room available was a\r\nclosetlike place directly connected with our mortuary.\r\n\r\nFrequently, bodies would be there overnight, awaiting the purposes of the\r\ncollege. Most persons would not welcome these as night-time neighbors,\r\nbut Peter scoffed and said he would as soon sleep there as in a brightly\r\nlighted hotel.\r\n\r\nChic Channing and I heard his foolish boast, and Chic and I had old\r\nscores to pay with Peter.\r\n\r\nHis sturdy fist had left a blue circle around my eye for a week, and\r\nChic was minus a tooth as a result of a hot encounter between Peter’s\r\nfollowers and us freshmen.\r\n\r\nChic jumped at this brilliant opening for reprisal.\r\n\r\n“Are you game for a little ghost-walking?” he whispered to me, as Peter\r\nand the Dean passed to another part of the building.\r\n\r\nI asked for details.\r\n\r\n“It’s the chance of a lifetime if we have the nerve,” he declared. “Let’s\r\nsneak back into the building tonight, crawl on to a couple of slabs in\r\nthe mortuary and cover ourselves with sheets. We’ll look enough like\r\ncorpses to fool Peter if he looks in. Then, when Peter goes to bed and it\r\ngets good and lonely, we can come to life with a few gentle moans, get\r\nPeter aroused, and then do a little ghost dance for his benefit. After\r\nwe have him frightened stiff we can take off the sheets and give him the\r\nlaugh. The story will get around quick enough, and poor old Peter won’t\r\nbe troubling us freshies any more.”\r\n\r\nI could scent trouble in the wild scheme, and I hastily began to offer\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\n“Peter knows there aren’t any bodies in there now,” I said.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” Chic replied. “I heard the dean tell him that a\r\ncouple might arrive late today. In fact, I know there will be one there\r\nfor certain. One of the inmates at the government hospital for the insane\r\ndied today, a poor beggar who was so wild they had to keep him locked up\r\ntight all the time. He had no friends, so the body is to come here and\r\nthe undertaker has already gone for it.”\r\n\r\nI was still unconvinced, but I had no plausible excuses. I felt my eye,\r\nwhich was still sore from Peter’s bruising, and I assented to the crazy\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChic was right about the body. The undertaker’s car drew up to the\r\ncollege just as we were leaving. We were the last students to go, and the\r\ndean was the only other person there.\r\n\r\nHe asked our aid in bringing the body to the mortuary, and we laid it on\r\na cold marble slab. Peter arrived from supper, to begin his first night’s\r\nstay, just as the dean and we were leaving.\r\n\r\nTrue to my promise, I met Chic near the college about ten o’clock and we\r\nprepared to carry out our plan. My courage was oozing already. One of\r\nthose wan yellow moons was the only light around the dreary building, and\r\nevery rustle of a leaf or a disturbed pebble began to send shivers up my\r\nspine. But I couldn’t turn back.\r\n\r\nSilently, we pried open one of the loosely locked basement windows. Then\r\nwe crept up dark stairs and through the classrooms, where I imagined I\r\ncould see the skeletons standing out like white patches in the murky\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nWe reached the mortuary room and groped our way in. I almost cried out as\r\nmy hand suddenly came in contact with the dead maniac, but I recovered\r\nmyself. Chic groped in the corners until he found two immense white\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nWe climbed upon adjacent slabs, and stretched out on our backs and pulled\r\nthe coverings over us. I managed to keep a small corner raised so that I\r\nhad a partial view of the room as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe stillness grew intense. We heard the long, dreary hoot of a freight\r\nengine. I shivered involuntarily and thought of the real corpse a few\r\nfeet away.\r\n\r\nFootsteps echoed in the building. Peter was making a round of inspection\r\nbefore retiring. He switched on the lights in the mortuary and gave a\r\nlittle whistle of surprise at the three still, white figures lying there.\r\n\r\nThen he began to whistle again, a little tremulously. Evidently he was\r\nnot feeling as bold as when he accepted his post. He went to his little\r\nroom, but was soon back again.\r\n\r\nIn his hand he held a small coil of rope, apparently a clothesline. He\r\nunwound it, and then, very gingerly, he approached the slab on which I\r\nlay.\r\n\r\nI felt a light blow as one end of the rope fell across me. Peter was\r\ngoing to take no chances on midnight ghosts. _He was going to tie us all\r\nfirmly to the slabs!_\r\n\r\nWhistling to keep up his courage, he proceeded with his task. In a few\r\nminutes I was firmly bound. I could not have moved if I dared.\r\n\r\nThen he cut away the remaining piece of rope and proceeded to truss up\r\nChic in the same way. He had to struggle to make the two ends of the cord\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nThere was none left for the real corpse, and, though he hunted diligently\r\nin all parts of the room, he could find no more.\r\n\r\nHe surveyed the two of us, bound firmly to the slabs, and evidently felt\r\nreassured. He decided to take a chance on the third body remaining still\r\nand retired to his room, closing the door and leaving us alone in the\r\ncreepy, moonlit mortuary.\r\n\r\nHow I cursed Chic as I lay there unable to move, listening to the\r\ngradually deepening breathing of Peter as he dropped into a sound sleep.\r\nWhat if he should leave us bound until the professors arrived in the\r\nmorning? What a fine row there would be!\r\n\r\nThese, and other unpleasant thoughts running through my mind, were\r\nsuddenly checked by a slight sound which turned me cold from head to\r\nfoot. Horrified, I gazed through the small chink in my covering. I could\r\nnot believe my eyes.\r\n\r\n_The corpse of the maniac had moved!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere came a faint rustle of his covering shroud, and the body moved\r\nagain ever so slightly. I wanted to shriek in terror, but I was paralyzed.\r\n\r\nThe shroud moved again, this time more noticeably. My scalp tightened,\r\nand I could feel the gooseflesh rising all over my body.\r\n\r\nThen, with one sudden motion, the maniac sat bolt upright and threw the\r\nshroud from him.\r\n\r\nHe was clothed only in a long, hospital nightgown. His thin hair stood up\r\nin tangled wisps, and his eyes blazed like those of a cat in a dark room.\r\n\r\nSlowly he surveyed his surroundings, and then burst into the most hideous\r\nlaughter I have ever heard. His big, yellow teeth seemed like the fangs\r\nof a wild animal. I could imagine them rending my flesh.\r\n\r\nThe echo of his hideous mirth had hardly died away when Peter burst from\r\nhis room, clad in his night clothes. His knees almost gave way as he took\r\nin the dreadful scene. Horror was apparent in every line of his body, and\r\nI had an inexplicable desire to laugh. But by a supreme effort I fought\r\noff this hysteria.\r\n\r\nQuite calmly the madman swung his legs down from the slab and sat there\r\non its edge, transfixing poor Peter with his terrible gaze. He chuckled.\r\n\r\nPeter commenced to back toward his room. In an instant the madman was at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen commenced a wild chase around the room, of which I could only catch\r\nfleeting glimpses as they passed on one side of my slab. Once the maniac\r\nrested bony hands on my body as he prepared for a new rush at Peter, whom\r\nI could hear breathing near by.\r\n\r\nBound hand and foot, Chic and I were unable to make a move, even if\r\nterror had not prevented us.\r\n\r\nUntiringly, cunningly, the madman pursued his prey. Peter dodged and\r\nsquirmed in terror. Perspiration poured from his face. But his efforts\r\nwere futile. He was penned in a corner, at last, where a door led\r\ndirectly to a stairway in the corridor.\r\n\r\nStep by step, the madman approached him, his long fingers outstretched\r\nlike talons, and a low, gleeful laugh came from his lips. Peter backed\r\ndesperately away from him, as though he hoped to press through the great\r\noaken door. The maniac’s fingers were almost at his throat, when the door\r\nswung back suddenly and Peter tumbled from the room, his body bumping and\r\nthudding on the stairs outside.\r\n\r\nStartled by the sudden disappearance of his victim, the madman halted\r\na moment. The door automatically swung shut again, firmly this time.\r\nApparently, it had not been tightly closed before.\r\n\r\nThe insane creature flung himself at it. It repelled him. He shrieked and\r\ntore at it, but to no avail, and he finally turned away.\r\n\r\nHis eyes, now wilder than ever, swept the room. They rested on our bound\r\nfigures. Swiftly, he passed over to where I lay. The rope puzzled him,\r\nand he was still for a moment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he grasped it and snapped it as though it had been thread. I was\r\nfree, but I did not move. I waited for him to seize me, but his footsteps\r\nshuffled away. He was beside Chic now. I heard the rope which bound him\r\nsnap.\r\n\r\nIn desperation, I rolled from the slab and rose trembling to my feet. The\r\nnoise attracted the crazed being. He turned and faced me.\r\n\r\nHis features were distorted into a horrible grin. His sharp, cruel teeth\r\ngnashed as if in expectation of a bloody feast. He leaped at me, clearing\r\nthe slab, on which I had lain, at one bound.\r\n\r\nI was too weak to dodge, but I tried grimly to clinch with him, as I had\r\nseen groggy boxers do when they were sparring for time. I was in his\r\narms. His eyes blazed not a foot from mine. Foam flecked his mouth. His\r\nweight pressed against me. It grew heavier and heavier.\r\n\r\nThen my overwrought nerves gave way, and I became unconscious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke I was outside in the cool night air. Chic was bathing my\r\nbrow with muddy water from a roadside pool. The madman had collapsed at\r\nthe same moment as I had. In a daze, Chic had laid him again on the slab\r\nand had dragged me from the building.\r\n\r\nPoor Peter we forgot, until he was found the next morning, haggard,\r\nwhite-haired and unable to utter an intelligible word.\r\n\r\nToo vivid an imagination, wrought into a frenzy by the uncanny\r\nsurroundings, was the way the doctors diagnosed his strange case. Chic\r\nand I were too dazed to shatter the theory.\r\n\r\nAs for the madman, he had really died, after the short spell of suspended\r\nanimation and temporary revival. I know this because his gaunt skeleton\r\nwas one of the principal decorations at our graduation dance.\r\n\r\nBut, even with this assurance, I sometimes wake at night in a cold sweat,\r\nand feel for the butt of the revolver under my pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrest Woman Accused of Witchcraft\r\n\r\n\r\nPopular rumors of a sorceress in the Logan Square district of Chicago\r\nled to the arrest of Mrs. Emily Elhert for practising medicine without a\r\nlicense. The woman styled herself a spiritualist and claimed the ability\r\nto heal any disease. She would make mysterious passes over her patients,\r\nand applied an evil-smelling salve, the composition of which is not\r\nknown. Each visit cost the patient two dollars, and Mrs. Elhert is said\r\nto have made very good money until the police interfered with her career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Electrocution, Vividly Described By An Eye Witness_\r\n\r\nTHE CHAIR\r\n\r\n_By_ DR. HARRY E. MERENESS\r\n\r\n_Former Physician at Sing Sing Prison_\r\n\r\n    Dr. Harry E. Mereness, who wrote this realistic description\r\n    of an electrocution, was attending physician at Sing Sing\r\n    Prison for six years, and during that period he attended, in\r\n    his official capacity, sixty-seven executions in the Electric\r\n    Chair—a record that has never been equaled. Among the many\r\n    noted executions he witnessed were those of Lieut. Becker of\r\n    the New York Police Department and the four gunmen in the\r\n    Rosenthal case. Prior to their death, he attended the prisoners\r\n    in the condemned cells.\r\n\r\n    “The average prisoner, approaching the moment of execution,”\r\n    says Dr. Mereness, “is in a mental haze or wild delirium\r\n    produced by the fear of death. In two instances, however, this\r\n    was lacking. Both men, after being strapped in the chair, said:\r\n    ‘Good-by, Doc!’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minute hand on my watch indicates 5:44 a. m. I am standing in a\r\ndirect line with the chair.\r\n\r\nMy gaze is directed to the left side of the room and down a short,\r\nnarrow, heavily-walled corridor that forms the communication between the\r\ncondemned cells and the execution chamber. There are a number of guards\r\nstanding quietly about, and on my right, back of a rope stretched across\r\nthe room, sit the witnesses.\r\n\r\nThere is a tension in the very air of the chamber. Absolute quiet\r\nprevails. A few seconds pass, eternally long they are.\r\n\r\nThen comes a sound—a muffled “Good-by, all.” The sound reaches the ears\r\nof the witnesses, and involuntarily they straighten up on their stools;\r\nthere is some scuffling of feet, and one witness, possibly a trifle more\r\nnervous than the rest, clears his throat. Everyone is now keenly alert.\r\n\r\nI hear the chant of the priest—the response of the condemned man—the low,\r\nquavering and broken response, “Have mercy on me.”\r\n\r\nThe little procession now enters the corridor. I see the condemned\r\nman—stocking-footed, and with his right trouser leg flapping, grimly\r\nludicrous, for it has been slit up to the knee in order to facilitate the\r\napplication of the leg electrode. He is between the deputy warden and his\r\nassistant, each supporting an arm as they slowly enter the death chamber.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the fateful and fatal chair, the condemned man\r\ninvoluntarily shrinks back, but the guards are prepared for this, and\r\ntheir hold becomes a little firmer. There is no halt in their step, and\r\nbut five paces away, inanimate, portentous and ominous—the chair!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright 1910 by Harry Hirschfeld._]\r\n\r\nAfter the first sight—after that sharp, quivering intake of breath—the\r\ngaze of the condemned man shifts about the room. His expression haunts\r\none. You feel that it is both all-seeing and unseeing. The fear of\r\ndeath—a definite emotion—is here portrayed in a fashion that but few have\r\nbeheld. There is utter finality in that look.\r\n\r\nHis eyes rest upon you. You feel that he sees you, but that you are\r\nsimply one of the images in the general make-up of the last picture that\r\nis conveyed to his brain. There is no recognition in the glance—just\r\na vague, hopeless and apparently vacant stare, but one which you feel\r\ndiscerns the sharp outlines of the persons and objects in the room,\r\nwithout recognizing features or details.\r\n\r\nTo me, that quick survey of his surroundings, that final glance of the\r\nunfortunate being on the very threshold of his meeting with his God,\r\nis the most harrowing of all the gruesome details connected with the\r\nadministration of man-made Law’s decree.\r\n\r\nMy watch indicates 5:45 a. m. The condemned man is seated in the Chair.\r\nThe guards work quickly, two at either side and one at the head of the\r\nChair. The arm straps are buckled fast, the leg straps next, then the\r\nface strap, which has an opening for the chin, and the upper part of\r\nwhich mercifully blindfolds the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe cap, a soft, pliable thing made of a fine copper mesh and lined with\r\nsponge, which has been moistened in salt water, is placed upon the head\r\nand moulded to fit its contour. To a binding-post on the cap is adjusted\r\nthe heavy wire that conveys the terrific current from the dynamo in a\r\ndistant part of the prison. To the bare right leg, another electrode is\r\napplied and connected up.\r\n\r\nA full minute has elapsed since I heard the “Good-by, all.” The guards\r\nhave completed their task. My notes now read: “Entered 5:44:10. Chair and\r\nstrapped 5:45:00.”\r\n\r\n“Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world have mercy on me,”\r\nchants the priest. And: “Have mercy on me,” comes the broken, almost\r\ninaudible and inarticulate response.\r\n\r\nI retain my position, note-book and watch in my left hand. I am standing\r\non the right side of, and in the same direct line with, the Chair. The\r\nChair and its occupant, the electrician and myself, form a right angle. I\r\noccupy the angle, for at the ends of the lines, which make up that angle,\r\nare the two things that demand my undivided attention—the electrician and\r\nthe condemned. From my point of vantage I can see them both. My eyes are\r\non the condemned man.\r\n\r\nI feel the eyes of the electrician upon me. I have a new, bright yellow\r\npencil—freshly sharpened. It is quite necessary for my notes. I hold it\r\nvertically on my note-book, and watch the occupant of the Chair. The\r\noverwhelming mental tension, coupled with the knowledge of the proximity\r\nof death, has a fearsome reaction upon the Chair’s victim. With each\r\nrapid inspiration, there is a slight elevation of the shoulders, and as\r\nexpiration takes place the shoulders sag. This is the very instant I have\r\nawaited—the lungs are practically free from air. I dip my pencil quickly\r\nfrom the vertical toward the horizontal.\r\n\r\nThere is a sudden _click_, the body in the Chair straightens, and from\r\nthe mouth comes a low, sibilant _hiss_; the straps creak, and you feel\r\nthat if the straps should break the body would be catapulted over the\r\nrope and amidst the witnesses.\r\n\r\nFor ten seconds the high current of eighteen hundred and fifty volts and\r\neight to nine amperes is on; then, for forty seconds, the voltage is\r\ndropped to two hundred.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the body sags perceptibly; at the end of forty seconds\r\nthe current is again increased, and the body again straightens and\r\nstrains against the straps. After the final ten seconds of the fatal\r\nminute, the current is switched off.\r\n\r\nThe body in the Chair actually shrinks before your very eyes! I step\r\nup to the Chair; a guard tears open the shirt and bares the chest. As\r\nI place my stethoscope over the heart I am conscious that the body is\r\nintensely hot. I know from experience that the heat generated by the\r\nrapidity of the passage of the current has raised the temperature from\r\nsub-normal to between 120 and 130 degrees.\r\n\r\nI hear a racing, tumultuous _rat-a-tat-tat_—possibly I can count the\r\nheart beats. I lift the face strap, and with thumb and forefinger\r\nseparate the lids. The eyes are glazed, but the pupils are small. I feel\r\nthe great arteries in the neck. I continue to get a pulsation that tells\r\nme that the vital forces have not yet ceased.\r\n\r\nMy notes now read: “First contact—one minute—5:45:10—5:46:10.”\r\n\r\nI step off the rubber mat and nod to the electrician; the current is\r\nagain thrown on, this time for five seconds. When I now listen over the\r\nheart, I am reminded of a clock that is running down; the heart beats\r\nare fainter—they become slower—they commence to skip—I fail to feel the\r\npulsation in the neck—there is a heavier glaze over the eyes—the pupils,\r\nsmall and contracted a moment before, are now widely dilated. The head\r\nrests on the shoulders, and the face is directed toward the chandelier\r\nwith its many lights, but there is no reaction of the pupil as the bright\r\nlight strikes the eye—it remains wide and big. The muscles of the face\r\nare set, and saliva drools from the angles of the mouth.\r\n\r\nI again place my stethoscope upon the chest, but no sound reaches my ear.\r\nI listen for five—for ten—for twenty seconds. There is nothing; all the\r\nvital reactions have disappeared.\r\n\r\nPhysicians among the witnesses are invited to listen; they take their\r\ntime, for there is no reason for hurry now. After the last one finishes I\r\nmake a final examination. It is as before—nothing.\r\n\r\nMy notes now state: “Second contact—5 seconds—5:47:00. Pronounced dead at\r\n5:52:00.”\r\n\r\nI turn toward the Warden and say, “I pronounce this man dead.”\r\n\r\nThe law has been obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe general attitude of tenseness is relieved. The guards quickly\r\nunbuckle the straps and carry the body to the autopsy room, and after\r\nplacing it upon the stone-topped table begin to remove the clothes. The\r\nhum of conversation becomes general. The witnesses are departing.\r\n\r\nI commence the autopsy, feeling that my report will be, “Autopsy upon the\r\nbody of ⸺ No. ⸺, convicted of murder, first degree and today executed at\r\nthis prison, showed all organs and tissues to be normal.”\r\n\r\nAs I begin my long sweeping incision, the thought always strikes me:\r\n“This must also be done because it is the Law,” and the invariable\r\nquestion comes, “Is it really the Law, or is it to insure the carrying\r\nout of the Law?”\r\n\r\nIn other words, if the Chair fails, the post mortem succeeds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is little left to tell. The evening papers will state that\r\n“So-and-so, convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death, was\r\nelectrocuted at Sing Sing Prison early this morning.” They will rehearse\r\nthe grewsome history of the crime and will tell how the murderer, with\r\nfirm step, entered the execution chamber at 5:44:10 a. m., and was\r\nstrapped in the chair at 5:45:00 a. m.\r\n\r\nThese details are quite correct. I can vouch for them, for I let the\r\nreporters take my notes, which are official, and they copy the data and\r\nembody it in their stories.\r\n\r\nThey invariably dress up the “first contact,” however, so their stories\r\nread about like this, “At 5:45:10 Warden Blank threw the switch, pressed\r\nthe button, or dropped his handkerchief, as a signal” (it is always one\r\nof these three).\r\n\r\nWell, I’m rather glad that they credit it to the Warden, and I really\r\nfeel better that I and my new, bright yellow pencil, freshly sharpened,\r\nhave been overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRare Music Disappears Mysteriously\r\n\r\n\r\nCaslav Albrecht, a Chicago violinist, recently made a trip to Europe and\r\nbrought back about thirty-five rare pieces of violin manuscript, which\r\ncannot be duplicated. Many of the compositions were original copies and\r\nthe whole is valued at $5,000. The music disappeared at a party given by\r\nFrank Steiner, another musician, which Albrecht attended. He says he had\r\nthe music with him when he came, and left it in the cloak-room during the\r\nfestivities, and that it was gone when he was ready to leave for home.\r\nAlthough Albrecht was sure the manuscripts were merely mislaid, no trace\r\nof them could be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cauldron\r\n\r\n_True Adventures of Terror_\r\n\r\nCONDUCTED BY PRESTON LANGLEY HICKEY\r\n\r\n    While most of the material in =WEIRD TALES= is, of course,\r\n    fiction, we are of the belief that there are innumerable\r\n    persons who have lived through experiences as weird, terrible\r\n    and horrifying as anything ever chronicled by a fictionist.\r\n    This belief, and the fact that =WEIRD TALES= deals exclusively\r\n    with the bizarre and unusual, has resulted in the establishment\r\n    of =THE CAULDRON=.\r\n\r\n    Readers who have had a hand in strange adventures, or who have\r\n    been victims of experiences of a startling and terrifying\r\n    nature, are cordially invited to send accounts of them to\r\n    =THE CAULDRON=. A concrete idea of what is desired may be\r\n    ascertained by reading this month’s contributions. Manuscripts\r\n    may be as horrible and hair-raising as it is in the power of\r\n    the author to make them, but they must be clean from a moral\r\n    standpoint. Those accepted will be paid for at our usual rate.\r\n    Tell your story clearly and briefly. Double-spaced, typewritten\r\n    manuscripts are preferred, but those in long hand will be\r\n    considered if legibly written.

I have heard\r\nintelligent men and women discuss ghosts seriously and tell of this\r\nand that spiritualistic seance that they attended where, before their\r\nvery eyes, misty forms of long departed dead have been materialized\r\nbefore their very eyes. To me all this appears more or less ridiculous.\r\nDuring the past fifteen years I have made a very thorough study of the\r\n“phenomena” of spiritualism, and my findings have resulted in my becoming\r\nskeptical on this subject. It is because of my emphatic disbelief in the\r\nsupernatural, as far as its direct relation to human man is concerned,\r\nthat I submit the following as one of the most inexplicable and\r\nterrifying things that has ever occurred to me:\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1906, my wife and I were residing in the township\r\nof North Lamoine, Maine, a fishing village situated on Frenchman’s Bay,\r\nan arm of the Atlantic which extends some miles inland. Our first born,\r\nthen twenty months old, had not been well for some time, and we thought\r\nperhaps a summer in the open country close to the sea would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nFor a time the little one appeared to rally, but failed to put on the\r\nweight or to assume the healthy look that a normal baby of her age\r\nshould. Then came a day when my wife struck terror to my heart by telling\r\nme that she had a premonition that something would happen—that the child\r\nwould not live.\r\n\r\nI scoffed at the notion and cheered her as best I could, but there was a\r\ngreat weight on my heart. I had begun to feel the same way, and the fact\r\nthat my wife mentioned it only intensified my grief.\r\n\r\nJust two days after this conversation there occurred the manifestation\r\nof which I write. My work kept me up later than usual, and it was not\r\nuntil after midnight that I finally retired. Worn out as I was from the\r\nactivities of the day, and though late the hour, it was some time before\r\nI could compose myself to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe baby, who slept with my wife at the other end of the room, moaned. A\r\nheavy electrical storm raged outside—the wind lashing the rain against\r\nthe window panes in unabating fury—and my thoughts were in a turmoil.\r\n\r\nFinally I began to doze and, I believe, was about to fall asleep when,\r\nwith a start, I found myself staring wide eyed at the ceiling. No one had\r\nspoken, and, save for the baby’s moans and the storm, there had been no\r\nsound, but something had impelled me to open my eyes. A moment later a\r\ncold perspiration broke out over my body.\r\n\r\nAt first, nothing was visible and then, even in the almost pitch darkness\r\nof the room, a filmy though strangely luminous grayish white object began\r\nto take form close to the ceiling just above my wife’s bed. It became\r\nclearer and clearer until finally it moved.\r\n\r\nAs rigid as a marble statue I lay. Though not exactly afraid, to have\r\nsaved my life I don’t believe I could have moved at that moment.\r\nGradually this indescribable object began to settle over the other bed.\r\nJust as it seemed to merge itself with the faint whiteness of the covers,\r\nthe baby cried out, to be followed an instant later by a piercing scream\r\nfrom my wife.\r\n\r\n“Back! back!” she gasped. “No! no! you shall not! For God’s sake _back_!”\r\n\r\nI remained motionless but an instant, long enough, however, to see the\r\nspecter gather itself into a compact form, flash upward and disappear.\r\nThen, with a mighty effort, I pulled myself together and bounded out of\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” my wife cried, sitting up, “did you see it?”\r\n\r\n“See what, dear?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Just now something white seemed to come down, with arms outstretched, as\r\nif to take little Helen away. I am sure I was not asleep.”\r\n\r\n“You must have been,” I answered. “I was wide awake all along and did not\r\nsee anything. The room is quite empty.”\r\n\r\n“Ugh,” she shuddered, “what a terrible dream!”\r\n\r\nThere was no sleep for me the rest of that night. For hours I sat in the\r\nliving-room, trying to fathom the mystery that I had beheld. I knew it\r\ncould not have been imagination, for my wife had seen it also. There was\r\nno accounting for it.\r\n\r\nAnd I am just as much in the dark now as I was then. God only knows what\r\nit was that my wife and I saw that night! Perhaps it was a matriculated\r\nspirit from the Valley of Death, after all.\r\n\r\nIn any event, Baby Helen died the next day.\r\n\r\n                                                                OWEN KING.\r\n\r\nEditor of The Cauldron: During the street car strike in Denver in 1919, I\r\nwas a reporter on the _Times_. On the night when the strikers and “Black\r\nJack” Jerome’s “breakers” met in deadly conflict, I was assigned to the\r\nEast Denver barns, in which Jerome’s men were fortified.\r\n\r\nToward midnight, the strikers stormed _en masse_ and, during the melée,\r\nI dropped with a bullet in my chest. Regaining consciousness, I found\r\nmyself in the City Hospital. Kneeling beside my bed was my wife—Estelle.\r\nI tried to move.\r\n\r\n“Lie still, dear,” she said, rising. “You must keep very quiet. They are\r\ngoing to probe for the bullet.”\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the operating room, the ether instantly choked me\r\ninto unconsciousness. Then occurred the strangest thing I have ever\r\nexperienced. I seemed suddenly transported into a great hall, with tall,\r\nshining pillars. All around me were people clothed in white. From afar\r\ncame the sound of soft music.\r\n\r\nBut what attracted me was a raised section at one end on which sat a\r\nbenevolent-looking old gentleman. In his eyes there seemed to be all the\r\nsorrow and suffering of a wicked world’s countless centuries. He beckoned\r\nto me. When I had come before him he spoke, and in his voice there was\r\nthe golden ring of perfectly tuned chimes.\r\n\r\n“My son,” he said, “you have been brought to judgment. At present you are\r\nno longer a part of the earth’s sphere. Back there science is fighting\r\nfor your life. Whether science succeeds is determined by this court of\r\njustice. What have you to say for yourself?”\r\n\r\nI trembled and became afraid. Where was I? Was I dead and in some\r\nspiritual sphere far removed from the earth?\r\n\r\nThen I spoke. I recall, distinctly, that I rambled on at great length,\r\nattempting to make a good impression. As I spoke he listened intently,\r\noccasionally nodding his head slowly and sadly.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished, he resumed:\r\n\r\n“Words and actions mean nothing here,” he said. “In passing judgment we\r\nconsider only motives. They are everything. Remember that. It is the\r\nmotives behind all actions that are important.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he turned to an aged man, who was writing in a book, and\r\nasked: “Any prayers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a young woman kneels at his bed.”\r\n\r\n“You shall return to earthly existence for a time then,” the judge said,\r\nraising his hands. “Heed well my words.”\r\n\r\nThen I saw a great light swell from some invisible source, and, as I\r\nlooked, there seemed to be ragged scars in his palms that ran red.\r\n\r\nWhen finally I opened my eyes I was again in my little bed, with Estelle\r\nand the doctor standing by. Eventually I recovered from my serious wound.\r\n\r\nThe weird vision that I had while on the operating table, though, has\r\nalways been a great mystery to me. Dreams are nothing unusual for me, but\r\nthis was so entirely different from anything that I have ever experienced\r\nbefore! I have spoken of it many times and to many people. They have not\r\nlaughed, but have listened in astonishment.\r\n\r\nWhat was it, I wonder? Was it the effect of the anesthetic upon my\r\nweakened system? Was it the wild distortion of my brain or, when life is\r\nflickering on the brink of eternity, are we actually brought face to face\r\nwith our Creator? Will this question ever be answered in life? I wonder!\r\n\r\n                                                              OTIS TREVOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH PLUNGE\r\n\r\nEditor of The Cauldron: I am an expert riveter. When beams are hoisted\r\ninto place on buildings I hang suspended in space on a swinglike seat and\r\nrivet the sections together. Had I followed any other pursuit I probably\r\nwould never have had the distinction of being the only man to fall twelve\r\nstories and live. It was during the construction of an eighteen story\r\nbank building that I experienced this extraordinary adventure.\r\n\r\nI was working in front on the twelfth story. At this particular time I\r\nwas directly under the crane which hoisted the great girders. Happening\r\nto glance down, I saw an exceptionally large load coming up. There were\r\nfive. It is seldom that more than three are hoisted at once. I watched\r\nthem ascend, interested in the process of landing so many. When they had\r\nalmost reached the level of the fifteenth story, the roof-man gave the\r\nsignal to slow down. Mistaking his motions, the crane operator pulled his\r\nreverse and the great beams swung inward.\r\n\r\nSeeing that collision between the front of the structure and the beams\r\nwas unavoidable, I attempted to get out of the way in the event anything\r\nhappened. I was not quick enough. With a crash, the girders smashed into\r\nthe building right over the heavy rope from which I hung, cutting it as\r\nthough it were string.\r\n\r\nThings happened so fast then that my memory of them is confused.\r\nInstantly I was precipitated downward. I do not know what sensations\r\na drowning man experiences, but have heard that a whole life time is\r\nflashed across the victim’s mind. That is just what happened in my case.\r\nEverything I ever did came before me in those terrifying moments.\r\n\r\nThough stricken with horror, I tried to keep my mind clear. Far below me\r\nI could see clusters of people gazing at me, horror stricken, as I fell,\r\nturning over and over.\r\n\r\nIn a moment’s time I was within four stories of the pavement. My breath\r\nwas almost gone. Insane with the thought of the terrible fate that\r\nawaited me, I shut my eyes. Then, with a great roaring in my ears, I\r\nstruck, and, though almost dead, knew that it wasn’t the street. For an\r\ninstant I was aware of great pain and then ... nothingness.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour I had regained consciousness. Fate was with me that day.\r\nJust as I fell a big open truck, piled high with cardboard boxes, had\r\nstopped beneath me. In this I landed; my fall was broken by these boxes,\r\nand I escaped a most horrible death.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, it was found that I suffered four fractured ribs, a\r\ncompound fracture of the left leg, two breaks in my right arm and a break\r\nin my left wrist in addition to severe cuts about the body and head. That\r\nis my story. I call it a narrow escape.\r\n\r\n                                                            JOHN BURKHOLZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYRIE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time has come to talk of cats and Chinamen, and rattlesnakes and\r\nskulls—and why it is these things abound in yarns for WEIRD TALES.\r\nParticularly cats and Chinamen. Believe it or not, every second\r\nmanuscript we open (and that’s placing the average rather low) is\r\nconcerned with one or the other, or both, of these.\r\n\r\nWhy is this? Is it because a cat and a Chinaman suggest the mysticism of\r\nthe Orient, and thus seem excellent “props” for weird fiction? Or is it\r\nmerely because both mind their own business, imperturbably pursue their\r\ndestinies, and thereby create the impression that there’s some deep-laid\r\nmystery here? We ask you that.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason, it’s an odd and curious fact that when an author\r\nsets out to tell a weird tale his mind turns, as if instinctively, to\r\ncats and Chinamen. And then, for good measure, he not infrequently throws\r\nin a few rattlesnakes and a skull or two.\r\n\r\nSometimes the result is interesting. And sometimes it is awful! And\r\nagain, sometimes, it is a ludicrous thing, unconsciously funny.\r\n\r\nWe have no prejudices against Chinese characters in fiction, and we have\r\nnone whatever against cats. For that matter, we haven’t any prejudices\r\nof any sort. We’ve published a good many stories about Chinese, and\r\nquite a large number about cats, and not a few that featured skulls and\r\nrattlesnakes. You’ll find some in this June issue.\r\n\r\nBut we didn’t accept those stories because of the aforementioned\r\nfeatures, nor yet in spite of them. We accepted them solely because they\r\nwere GOOD stories. We observe one rule, and one rule only, in selecting\r\nstories for your entertainment. We think we’ve mentioned this before,\r\nbut we’ll say again that our only requirement is: The thing MUST be\r\ninteresting!\r\n\r\nIf a story interests us it will likewise interest others, or so we\r\nbelieve. And if it doesn’t—Thumbs Down! And it doesn’t matter a good gosh\r\ndarn whether the hero, or villain, has yellow skin and oblique eyelids,\r\nor flaxen hair and sky-blue eyes, or whether or not a green-eyed cat\r\nhowls atop a grinning skull. The story’s the thing!\r\n\r\nAll the same, though, we would like to know why all these cats and\r\nChinamen are slinking mysteriously through our manuscripts. We read eight\r\nbefore breakfast this morning (chosen quite at random), and we hope to\r\ndie if there wasn’t a Chinaman in every last one of them!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd still the letters pour in from delighted readers—plenty of them!\r\nManifestly, it is quite impossible to print more than a fractional part\r\nof them here, but we can’t refrain from quoting at least three that\r\nconcern Paul Suter’s story, “Beyond the Door,” which appeared in the\r\nApril WEIRD TALES.\r\n\r\nWe take it you remember this story and will therefore be interested in\r\nthese comments. The first letter comes from R. E. Lambert, secretary of\r\nthe Washington Square College of New York University, New York, and reads\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir: Just as Woodrow Wilson used to say during his most\r\n    trying days in the presidency that when he wanted to get his\r\n    mind completely off his work he would turn to a detective\r\n    story, so I turn for my own relaxation to the horror story.\r\n\r\n    “I suppose it would take exhaustive questioning by a\r\n    psychoanalyst to discover why this sort of literature appeals\r\n    to me, but the fact is it does so appeal. While there are\r\n    hundreds of others like me in this respect, I doubt whether\r\n    the number is great enough to make such a venture as yours a\r\n    considerable financial success—therefore, the more praise to\r\n    you for your courage in launching WEIRD TALES.\r\n\r\n    “What particularly impelled me to write this letter is the\r\n    story in the current issue, entitled ‘Beyond the Door.’\r\n    One reason why I single this one from such a congeries of\r\n    thrilling, weird tales is that, with all its mystery and\r\n    suggestion of the supernatural, the dénouement and everything\r\n    that leads up to it are discovered at the end to be logically\r\n    and physically ‘possible.’ So often, in mystery stories, we\r\n    are called upon to accept much that simply is not naturally\r\n    possible, and we turn from them, duly horrified, but\r\n    unpersuaded that the tale is more than a figment of a morbid\r\n    imagination.\r\n\r\n    “From the standpoint of construction, I have read few stories\r\n    that so faithfully adhere to the trinity of short story\r\n    tradition—unity, coherence and mass. Especially on the score of\r\n    unity, the most important of the trinity, do I find this tale\r\n    worthy of much praise. Not a situation, not a paragraph, nor\r\n    a sentence, but which has a direct bearing on the unfoldment\r\n    of the plot. And I find no single instance where the choice of\r\n    words seems to have resulted from a straining for effect. Of\r\n    how many stories, whether horrific or any other kind, can this\r\n    truly be said?\r\n\r\n    “Then, too, very few tales are really brought home to the\r\n    reader’s own intimate experience of life. Yet here we shudder\r\n    at the terrors created by a guilty conscience, and approve,\r\n    while we shudder, of the terrible punishment that is meted out\r\n    for the wrong-doing. How very real it thus becomes to all of us!\r\n\r\n    “Finally, the author dares to do, and admirably succeeds in\r\n    doing, what so few writers of fiction attempt—and mostly bungle\r\n    when they do attempt. I refer to the linking of his story in\r\n    the closing paragraphs to man’s inevitable, age-old uncertainty\r\n    as to what is to come in the hereafter. This alone elevates\r\n    ‘Beyond the Door’ out of the ordinary run of fiction.\r\n\r\n    “Here’s wishing you a well-merited success!”\r\n\r\nThe next one was written by Rev. Andrew Wallace MacNeill, minister of the\r\nBethlehem Congregational Church, International Falls, Minnesota:\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen: I have read with much interest and pleasure the\r\n    April number of your new magazine, which I believe will make\r\n    a distinctive and acceptable place for itself in magazine\r\n    literature.\r\n\r\n    “I am particularly interested in the story by a new writer,\r\n    Paul Suter, ‘Beyond the Door’ proving exceptionally appealing\r\n    and gripping. I hope you will publish more work by this writer,\r\n    as I believe if he maintains the standard of this story your\r\n    readers will make quite a popular response.”\r\n\r\nAnd the third letter, which arrived in the same mail that brought the\r\nfirst two, came from the author himself:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Baird: I take it that even editors enjoy an\r\n    occasional pat on the back, in the midst of the many\r\n    black looks they receive, so I am presuming to express my\r\n    appreciation of the way in which you printed my story, ‘Beyond\r\n    the Door,’ in your April issue.\r\n\r\n    “There is a story which might easily have been rendered\r\n    monotonous by unintelligent press work—because the effect of\r\n    slowly undermining horror, which I had to attain, is akin to\r\n    monotony. You avoided that pitfall by change of type—and (this\r\n    to me is the remarkable thing) I can tell by the way in which\r\n    you ran in those changes that you got absolutely every subtle\r\n    suggestion which I concealed in that story—and I buried quite\r\n    a lot of them there. You must have read my manuscript with a\r\n    microscope. May I take the liberty of expressing my opinion\r\n    that as an editor you are emphatically THERE?\r\n\r\n                           “Cordially yours,\r\n\r\n                                                    “J. Paul Suter.”\r\n\r\nWe almost dislike to print this last one—it’s too much like pinning a\r\nmedal on our coat—but we can plead, in extenuation, that the excellence\r\nof Mr. Suter’s story was not due to our editing, or printer’s directions,\r\nor anything of the sort, but solely to his splendid craftsmanship. He\r\nwrote a good story and we published it, and no amount of editing could\r\nhave made it any better.\r\n\r\nIf you failed to read “Beyond the Door” we earnestly recommend that you\r\ndo so now. In either case, don’t miss his next story. It is called “The\r\nGuard of Honor,” and is fully as “creepy” as the first—and you will find\r\nit in the next issue of WEIRD TALES.\r\n\r\nSuter is a coming writer. No doubt of that. And since he tells us, “I\r\nwould rather write horror stories than anything else,” we hope to publish\r\nthe best of his work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe’ve ransacked a bale of Letters to the Editor in an effort to find some\r\nnot sweet with praise! and we’ve found only two, and here they are:\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir: I have purchased two copies of your new magazine,\r\n    have read the stories, and also the praise liberally supplied\r\n    by friends and readers. I think it is time to offer a few words\r\n    of criticism, since applause and praise of this kind does\r\n    not mean much. The public lauds any new effort; it applauds\r\n    anything, even moving pictures.\r\n\r\n    “The stories you have printed so far can be grouped under\r\n    three general headings: Ghost Stories, Snake Stories, Insanity\r\n    Stories. In your first issue you printed a story called ‘Ooze’\r\n    which approached the type of semi-scientific stories that are\r\n    liked intensely by all those who are fond of the unusual,\r\n    and if you would publish at least one story of this type in\r\n    each issue of your magazine I am sure that your efforts would\r\n    register larger sales.”—Conrad A. Brandt, 563 West 150th Street\r\n    New York City.\r\n\r\n    “My dear Mr. Baird: At last it arrived—that second volume. If\r\n    you play that slow trick again on us we shall send one of our\r\n    aviators to Chicago to get the so strenuously desired copy.\r\n\r\n    “Allow me to tell you which story in the April number I liked\r\n    best and which I hate best. ‘The Scar’ by Dr. Carl Ramus was\r\n    a gem. Plausible, scientifically correct, well told, no words\r\n    wasted. ‘The Whispering Thing’ is the acme of foolish, silly,\r\n    nonsensical, high-school girl, bucket-of-blood story. If you\r\n    waste more paper on such rotten stuff I predict failure in\r\n    caps.”—Adeline Jugol, Covina Apartments, Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nOuch!\r\n\r\nLuckily, though, not all our readers disrelished “The Whispering Thing.”\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir: Having recently read the second issue of WEIRD\r\n    TALES, I cannot refrain from expressing my congratulations\r\n    on your rare fiction taste as an editor. I enjoyed reading\r\n    the novelette by Harold Ward, but the authors who wrote ‘The\r\n    Whispering Thing’ have an imagination which is extraordinary. I\r\n    happened to read this story late at night, and I began to look\r\n    for ‘spooks.’ Talk about horror and terror combined! This story\r\n    is nothing short of a marvel.\r\n\r\n    “I sincerely believe that you have an innate tendency for\r\n    selecting stories of this type, and if you keep this class\r\n    of stories running you will, without the least doubt, be a\r\n    success.”—O. R. Hamilton, 4002 Avenue F, Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the poetic effusion that follows, we’re not sure whether\r\n“Witch Hazel” is spoofing us or having a spasm of ecstasy. At any rate,\r\nwe’ll take a chance and print the thing just as she wrote it:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Editor: No words can express how much I enjoy your\r\n    magazine. Here is what I think of it:\r\n\r\n    “Oh, what is more pleasure than a show,\r\n    A party, bon bons, or even a beau?\r\n    Well, here’s the answer (all readers take heed);\r\n    WEIRD TALES and a nice quiet place to read!\r\n\r\n    “It’s my favorite magazine, and I can hardly wait for\r\n    each number to come out. I think it is the most wonderful\r\n    magazine in the world, as it is so different, so extremely\r\n    interesting—but there! I can never say enough in its praise.\r\n    As my little verse says, ‘I like it better than anything,’ and\r\n    I’ve often said I wished some editor would publish just such a\r\n    magazine, and thank you, Mr. Baird (you Good Fairy) for doing\r\n    so. I can hardly wait for the next issue. Thank you for filling\r\n    a long felt need, and good luck!”—Witch Hazel of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nWe’ve scores of flattering letters here, but we’re not going to print\r\nthem all [prolonged and loud applause], because, for one thing, we\r\nhaven’t space, and, for another, we have a sneaking suspicion that our\r\ndelight in reading them is not always shared by others. So we’ll run only\r\nfive or six more, and call it a day.\r\n\r\n    “My dear Mr. Baird: I don’t mind admitting that I was a little\r\n    leary about WEIRD TALES when I first heard of it. The fact of\r\n    the matter is, I picked up the first copy with a good deal of\r\n    prejudice against it. The reason for this prejudice is clear\r\n    enough. I have always had a healthy respect for mystery stories\r\n    and believe they are the hardest kind to write—and to judge.\r\n\r\n    “For this reason I am moved to write you and tell you how very\r\n    much my view point has changed. You have not only sold me, you\r\n    have enthused me. There is no question about your future. I’ve\r\n    talked to many friends who have read the March issue, and I\r\n    know.”—A. M. Oliver, 148 North Portage Path, Akron, Ohio.\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir: I asked my newsdealer for something different in the\r\n    magazine line today, and he handed me a copy of the April WEIRD\r\n    TALES. I’ve read many so-called mystery stories, but none can\r\n    compare with those I found in your magazine. It is something\r\n    altogether new and most fascinating. I especially enjoyed\r\n    ‘The Snake Fiend’ and ‘The Conquering Will.’ Those sort of\r\n    stories appeal to me. For anybody that is looking for something\r\n    different I heartily advise your magazine. May you prosper!”—P.\r\n    W. Burrows, Kearney, Nebraska.\r\n\r\n    “Dear sirs: ... I was in the business section of Des Moines\r\n    one evening recently when my eye fell upon a copy of WEIRD\r\n    TALES. Struck by its unusual appearance, I bought one. When\r\n    I arrived home it was rather early, and I sat down to read.\r\n    Well, I had not finished a half dozen pages before I knew I had\r\n    found a marvelous book—in fact, my ideal magazine. Before I had\r\n    finished the second story I was as much in its power as our\r\n    detective friend seems to be in the power of ‘The Whispering\r\n    Thing.’...\r\n\r\n    “But here I have been taking up your time with praise of the\r\n    Wonder Magazine and haven’t spoken of the most vital thing—the\r\n    thing which makes such mighty entertainment possible. Please\r\n    find enclosed three dollars for which please enter me for a\r\n    year’s subscription to WEIRD TALES, beginning with your third\r\n    issue.”—J. C. Wolquist, 1544 Walker Street, Des Moines, Iowa.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Baird: Three weeks ago I bought a copy of WEIRD\r\n    TALES, and I am shaking yet, as you probably can tell by\r\n    my scribbling!... The first story I read was ‘The Thing of\r\n    a Thousand Shapes.’ It happened to be eleven-thirty when I\r\n    finished the first installment, and I went to bed quaking in\r\n    every limb, firmly resolved never to lay eyes on another copy\r\n    of WEIRD TALES.\r\n\r\n    “A few days later I passed a news stand. There, glaring into my\r\n    eyes, was the interesting cover of WEIRD TALES. I was about to\r\n    turn away when curiosity whispered in my ear, ‘What happened to\r\n    Billy?’\r\n\r\n    “Being a woman, curiosity, of course, won, and home I went,\r\n    with the copy tucked snugly under my arm.... And now I look\r\n    on WEIRD TALES as a friend indeed. I daren’t let my little\r\n    brother get the magazine before he does his lessons, or they\r\n    would never get done, while such an absorbing magazine is\r\n    around.”—Miss Marguerite Nicholson, 635 North Frazier Street,\r\n    Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Baird: Congratulations! Your new magazine is simply\r\n    splendid. I have often wondered just when I would be able to go\r\n    to a news stand and buy a real magazine. Now all my worry has\r\n    ceased.... There is one trouble with it, and that is that it\r\n    doesn’t come weekly or semi-monthly.”—M. Nawrocki, 854 Robinson\r\n    Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Baird: ... I have thoroughly enjoyed DETECTIVE TALES,\r\n    every issue of it, and believe that there is more good reading\r\n    matter in it than in any other magazine published, and when I\r\n    saw a copy of WEIRD TALES at the news stand, with your name or\r\n    it, I could not resist getting it. And it has lived up to my\r\n    expectations. I could not put the magazine down until I had\r\n    finished every story, and that was about three o’clock the next\r\n    morning.”...—Mary Sharon, 1912 Main Street, Galena, Kansas.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s now three o’clock in the afternoon, and the printer is calling\r\nfor copy, and—\r\n\r\nThat’ll be all.\r\n\r\n                                                               THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMargaret Sanger dares to tell the truth about Birth Control\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Margaret Sanger]\r\n\r\nFor centuries the world has played a game of “hush” about the one most\r\nimportant fact of marriage. Even today tens of thousands of women are\r\ndoomed to a life of hopeless, helpless drudgery—and their children are\r\ndoomed to privation and neglect because the mother simply can not give so\r\nmany of them the proper care or support.\r\n\r\nWords alone can not tell the terrible sacrifice in wasted bodies and\r\nblasted lives that has been exacted from women every year. Words alone\r\ncan not express the untold suffering tens of thousands of women—and\r\nchildren—must endure every year. That is why Margaret Sanger, herself a\r\nmother, and President of the American Birth Control League, dares to tell\r\nthe truth about this important subject.\r\n\r\nWill you ever write a letter like this?\r\n\r\nOnly these agony-laden letters can tell the story of woman’s sacrifice\r\nin all its anguish. These are but a few of thousands sent every day to\r\nMargaret Sanger by unhappy mothers who have turned to her for help in\r\ntheir greatest need, revealing to her the nameless fears and terrors that\r\nclutch at their hearts. Read these letters, and know for yourself what\r\nwomen still suffer:\r\n\r\n    “It is terrible to think of bringing these little bodies and\r\n    souls into the world, without means or strength to care for\r\n    them. I know that this must be the last one, for it would be\r\n    better for me to go than to bring more neglected babies into\r\n    the world.”\r\n\r\n    “My baby is only 10 months old, and the oldest of my four\r\n    children is 7. I am so discouraged I want to die. Ignorance on\r\n    this all-important subject has put me where I am.”\r\n\r\n“Why is it,” Mrs. Sanger asks, “that the women of Australia, New Zealand,\r\nHolland, France, and many other nations are permitted to know the\r\ntruths that can save them from this terrible suffering, while the women\r\nof America must still endure the agonies to which they are needlessly\r\ncondemned?” Margaret Sanger considers it a slur upon the intelligence\r\nof American womankind to deny to them the knowledge which has brought\r\nfreedom, health, happiness, and life itself, to the women of other\r\nnations. That is why she has braved the storms of denunciation, why\r\nshe has fought through every court in the land for her right to arouse\r\nwoman-kind.\r\n\r\nIn her revolutionary book, Margaret Sanger, internationally famous for\r\nher ceaseless activities in behalf of women and hailed as the liberator\r\nof her sex, shows the way out for tired, struggling womankind. With utter\r\nfrankness she tears down the veil of silence that has always surrounded\r\nthe subject of birth control. It is a startling revelation of a new truth\r\nthat will open the eyes of women everywhere.\r\n\r\n    Is the Husband or Wife to Blame?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    Whose is the blame for the tragedy of too many children—husband\r\n    or wife?\r\n\r\n    Margaret Sanger, the great Birth Control advocate, comes with a\r\n    message vital to every married man and woman.\r\n\r\nIn her wonderful book Mrs. Sanger shows how women can and will rise\r\nabove the forces that have ruined their beauty—that drag them down—that\r\nwreck their mental and physical strength—that make them an easy prey for\r\ndeath—that disqualify them for society, for self-improvement—and finally\r\nshut them out from the thing they cherish most, their husband’s love.\r\n\r\nIn blazing this revolutionary trail to the new freedom of women, this\r\ndaring and heroic author points out that women who can not afford to\r\nhave more than one or two children, should not do so. It is a crime to\r\nherself, a crime to her children, a crime to society.\r\n\r\nA Priceless Possession\r\n\r\nNow Margaret Sanger’s message to all women, contained in “Woman and the\r\nNew Race,” is made available to the public.

If it does, then let me tell you\r\nwhat J. R. Head did in a small town in Kansas. Head lives in a town of\r\n631 people. He was sick, broke, out of a job. He accepted my offer. I\r\ngave him the same chance I am now offering you. At this new work he has\r\nmade as high as $69.50 for one day’s work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. R.

Inside of six months he was making between $600 and $1,200 a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nW. J. McCrary is another I want to tell you about.

Olsen, 3715 Wadsworth St.,\r\nLos Angeles, Cal. “I would not take $1,000 for my financial and social\r\ngain through your lessons. I don’t know how you can give so much for so\r\nlittle. I think your method is just wonderful.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Olsen is only one of more than three hundred thousand men, women\r\nand young people who have become accomplished musicians through this\r\nwonderful new method. All the intricate “mysteries” of music have been\r\nreduced to a system of amazing simplicity. Every step is made as clear\r\nas A. B. C. You don’t have to know anything whatever about music. You\r\nlearn to play your favorite instrument right in your own home, quickly,\r\neasily and without endless study and practice. Long before you now think\r\nit could ever be possible, you will actually play well enough to be in\r\ndemand as a well-paid entertainer, teacher or musician.\r\n\r\nA delighted 17-year-old girl, Miss Jessie Theall of North Houston, Tex.\r\nwrites, “My first six entertainments that I played the violin for, paid\r\nme $39.25 besides all the pleasure of playing for my friends.”\r\n\r\n$10 to $40 in Two Hours\r\n\r\nA busy mother, Mrs. Anna M. Lewis of Northfield, Ohio, recently learned\r\nto play the violin in just the few odd moments she could spare from her\r\nhousehold duties, and now earns many welcome dollars to help clothe and\r\neducate her four children. “At weddings and church socials I get from\r\n$10 to $40 for a couple of hours playing,” she writes. “I am invited\r\neverywhere, and my home is so much happier.”\r\n\r\nThe new way is fun—not drudgery. You’ll begin to play melodies almost\r\nfrom the start. You don’t have to pin yourself down to regular hours and\r\nregular classes. You practice whenever you can, and learn as quickly as\r\nyou please.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSave Months of Time\r\n\r\n“I have learned to play better than many a conservatory student in easily\r\none-eighth the time,” writes Miss Kitty Breany, 154 Warren St., Paterson,\r\nN. J. “The lessons are so interesting that they seem like play. A lady I\r\nknow spent $400 for a private teacher, but her playing cannot begin to\r\ncompare with mine.”\r\n\r\nYou can do what Miss Breany has done. Youngsters of from 10 to 12 years\r\nhave done it, and people as old as sixty have found new interest and\r\nenjoyment in learning to play a musical instrument. You don’t have to\r\nlisten while others entertain. You can be the talented person who is the\r\ncenter of attraction; who holds the audience fascinated; who wins the\r\napplause—and the dollars.\r\n\r\nPlays in Orchestra and Band\r\n\r\n“I am solo clarinet in a twenty-piece band, (mostly old players),”\r\nwrites Gerald O. Cairus, 20 High St., Walton, N. Y. “Also am member of\r\nan eighteen-piece orchestra, whose director has studied in all the large\r\nconservatories of America and Germany. He was astonished when I told him\r\nhow I learned to play.”\r\n\r\n“In three months I was playing saxophone in the High School orchestra.\r\nThe fourth month I organized a profitable dance orchestra,” writes George\r\nJohnson, 402 Newton St., Salisbury, Md. “And now, at college, I play in\r\nconcerts of the Musical Club in New York, Philadelphia, Atlantic City,\r\netc.”\r\n\r\nThree Months From Today You, Too, Can Play\r\n\r\nIs it the piano that you wish to play, or the organ, violin, guitar,\r\nharp or cello? Do you want to learn to sing from notes? Are you eager\r\nto play “jazz” on the banjo, clarinet, Saxophone, trombone, or the drum\r\nand traps? Does the cornet call to you, or the flute or piccolo? Would\r\nyou love to learn the ukulele (the Hawaiian steel guitar)? Choose your\r\nfavorite—and play it three months from today.\r\n\r\nYou will learn by notes—the only practical way for you to learn. There\r\nare no “numbers” and no “tricks” in this marvelous method.

Why miss most of the real fun when you can so easily\r\nlearn to dance in a single evening right in the privacy of your own home?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Aren’t they foolish to envy wonderful dancing ability\r\nwhen they could so easily and quickly learn to dance in their own home?_]\r\n\r\nWeek end parties—little social affairs—formal and informal\r\noccasions—regular dances—the phonograph or orchestra going with\r\ntoe-tickling music—couples whirling around, dancing the very latest\r\nsteps—everybody happy, carefree, and having a fine time!\r\n\r\nIt’s a shame for you not to know how to dance, when it is so easy to\r\nlearn. Arthur Murray, America’s greatest dancing teacher, has perfected\r\na wonderful new method that enables you to learn any of the very latest\r\ndances in a few minutes—and to learn all of them in a few hours.\r\n\r\nEven if you don’t know one step from another, you can very quickly learn\r\nto dance in a single evening through this method. You don’t need to leave\r\nyour home to learn—you can master any dance in your own room after a few\r\npractice steps. And you can now prove it—at Arthur Murray’s expense.\r\nHe will teach you to dance in one evening or your lessons won’t cost\r\nyou a cent. Then, at the very next affair when dancing begins, you can\r\nstep right out with absolute confidence that every movement you make is\r\nperfectly correct, whether you are dancing the Fox Trot, One Step, Waltz,\r\nor any of the newer steps.\r\n\r\nHere’s What a Few Say:\r\n\r\nI am well satisfied that your way of teaching is best. I have taken\r\nlessons from dancing teachers in Huntington, W. Va., Chattanooga, Tenn.,\r\nand Birmingham, Ala. Your instructions are better than the personal\r\nteachers, and thru your methods I am becoming a good dancer. I will do\r\nall in my power to get new pupils for you.\r\n\r\n                                                            J. T. BERRY,\r\n                                                            Anniston, Ala.\r\n\r\nI want to tell you how wonderful your course is. I was taught by other\r\ndancing teachers, but I prefer your lessons because I accomplished more\r\nand learned more quickly thru your lessons than by other teachers. I am\r\nnow enjoying myself very much, and advise all those who want to know the\r\ncorrect way of dancing to take your lessons. I am enjoying many pleasant\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n                                                  E. P.

People are amazed at the ease with which\r\none grasps the idea from your directions. I feel grateful to you.\r\n\r\n                                                            GRACE THREFALL\r\n                                                            Guler, Wash.\r\n\r\nI have made use of all the instructions sent me and am well pleased with\r\nthe course.\r\n\r\n                                         BEULAH ROGERS,\r\n                                         4471 Monroe Street, Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nYour course has given me a good knowledge of dancing.
