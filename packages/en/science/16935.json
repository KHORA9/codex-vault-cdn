It is simply an outline of the external features of his life\r\nand an account of his contributions to biology, to educational and\r\nsocial problems, and to philosophy and metaphysics. In preparing it, I\r\nhave been indebted to his own Autobiography, to the obituary notice\r\nwritten by Sir Michael Foster for the Royal Society of London, to a\r\nsketch of him by Professor Howes, his successor at the Royal College\r\nof Science, and to his published works. The latter consist of many\r\nwell-known separate volumes which are familiar to all zoölogists, and\r\nof a vast number of memoirs and essays scattered in various scientific\r\nand general publications. The general Essays were collected into nine\r\nvolumes, revised by himself in the later years of his life, and\r\npublished by Messrs. Macmillan. The Scientific Memoirs, thanks to the\r\ngenerous enterprise of the same publishing firm, with which he was so\r\nlong associated, and to the pious labours of Sir Michael Foster and\r\nProfessor Ray Lankester, are in process of reissue in the form of four\r\nvolumes, two of which have now appeared. These will contain all his\r\nimportant contributions to science, with the exception of a large\r\nseparate treatise on the _Oceanic Hydrozoa_ published by the Ray\r\nSociety in 1859. There is also announced a formal Biography, prepared\r\nby his son, so that future admirers or students of Huxley's work will\r\nbe in an exceptionally favourable position.\r\n\r\nLONDON, 1900.\r\n\r\nP.

All the advantages that wealth\r\nand the experience of friends can bring attend their growth to\r\nmanhood, and their success almost loses its interest because of the\r\nease with which it is attained. Few of the leaders of science were in\r\nsuch a position: many of them, such as Priestley, Davy, Faraday, John\r\nHunter, and Linnæus were of humble parentage, and received the poorest\r\neducation: most of them, like Huxley himself, have come from parents\r\nwho were able to do little more for their children than set them out\r\ninto life along the ordinary educational avenues. In Huxley's boyhood\r\nat least a comfortable income was necessary for this: in every\r\ncivilised country nowadays, state endowments, or private endowments,\r\nare ready to help every capable boy, as far as Huxley was helped, and\r\nin his progress from boyhood to supreme distinction, there is nothing\r\nthat cannot be emulated by every boy at school to-day. The minds of\r\nhuman beings when they are born into the world are as naked as their\r\nbodies; it matters not if parents, grandparents, and remoter ancestors\r\nwere unlettered or had the wisdom of all the ages, the new mind has to\r\nbuild up its own wisdom from the beginning. We cannot even say with\r\ncertainty that children inherit mental aptitudes and capacities from\r\ntheir parents; for as tall sons may come from short parents or\r\nbeautiful daughters from ugly parents, so we may find in the\r\ncapacities of the parents no traces of the future greatness of their\r\nchildren. None the less it is interesting to learn what we can about\r\nthe parents of great men; and Huxley tells us that he thinks himself\r\nto have inherited many characters of his body and mind from his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThomas Henry Huxley was born on the 4th of May, 1825, at Ealing, then\r\na little country village, now united to London as a great suburb. He\r\nwas the seventh child of George Huxley, who was second master at the\r\nschool of Dr. Nicholson at Ealing. In these days private schools of\r\nvarying character were very numerous in England, and this\r\nestablishment seems to have been of high-class character, for Cardinal\r\nNewman and many other distinguished men received part of their\r\neducation there. His mother, whose maiden name was Rachel Withers,\r\nwas, he tells us himself:[A]\r\n\r\n     \"A slender brunette of an emotional and energetic temperament,\r\n     and possessed of the most piercing black eyes I ever saw in a\r\n     woman's head. With no more education than other women of the\r\n     middle classes in her day, she had an excellent mental capacity.\r\n     Her most distinguishing characteristic, however, was rapidity of\r\n     thought. If one ventured to suggest she had not taken much time\r\n     to arrive at any conclusion, she would say, 'I cannot help it.\r\n     Things flash across me.' That peculiarity has been passed on to\r\n     me in full strength: it has often stood me in good stead: it has\r\n     sometimes played me sad tricks, and it has always been a danger.\r\n     But, after all, if my time were to come over again there is\r\n     nothing I would less willingly part with than my inheritance of\r\n     'mother wit.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom his father he thinks that he inherited little except an inborn\r\ncapacity for drawing, \"a hot temper, and that amount of tenacity of\r\npurpose which unfriendly observers sometimes call obstinacy.\" As it\r\nhappened, this natural gift for drawing proved of the greatest service\r\nto him throughout his career. It is imperative that every investigator\r\nof the anatomy of plants and animals should be able to sketch his\r\nobservations, and there is no greater aid to seeing things as they are\r\nthan the continuous attempt to reproduce them by pencil or brush.\r\n\r\nHuxley was christened Thomas Henry, and he was unaware why these names\r\nwere chosen, but he humorously records the curious chance that his\r\nparents should have chosen for him the \"name of that particular\r\napostle with whom he had always felt most sympathy.\"\r\n\r\nOf his childhood little is recorded. He remembers being vain of his\r\ncurls, and his mother's expressed regret that he soon lost the beauty\r\nof early childhood. He attended for some time the school at Ealing\r\nwith which his father was associated, but he has little to say for the\r\ntraining he received there. He writes:\r\n\r\n     \"My regular school training was of the briefest, perhaps\r\n     fortunately: for, though my way of life has made me acquainted\r\n     with all sorts and conditions of men, from the highest to the\r\n     lowest, I deliberately affirm that the society I fell into at\r\n     school was the worst I have ever known. We boys were average lads\r\n     with much the same inherent capacity for good and evil as any\r\n     others; but the people who were set over us cared about as much\r\n     for our intellectual and moral welfare as if they were\r\n     baby-farmers. We were left to the operation of the struggle for\r\n     existence among ourselves, and bullying was the least of the ill\r\n     practices current among us. Almost the only cheerful reminiscence\r\n     in connection with the place which arises in my mind is that of a\r\n     battle which I had with one of my class-mates, who had bullied me\r\n     until I could stand it no longer. I was a very slight lad, but\r\n     there was a wild-cat element in me which, when roused, made up\r\n     for my lack of weight, and I licked my adversary effectually.\r\n     However, one of my first experiences of the extremely rough and\r\n     ready nature of justice, as exhibited by the course of things in\r\n     general, arose out of the fact that _I_--the victor--had a black\r\n     eye, while he--the vanquished--had none, so that I got into\r\n     disgrace and he did not. One of the greatest shocks I ever\r\n     received in my life was to be told, a dozen years afterwards by\r\n     the groom who brought me my horse in a stable-yard in Sydney,\r\n     that he was my quondam antagonist. He had a long story of family\r\n     misfortune to account for his position--but at that time it was\r\n     necessary to deal very cautiously with mysterious strangers in\r\n     New South Wales, and on enquiry I found that the unfortunate\r\n     young man had not only been 'sent out,' but had undergone more\r\n     than one colonial conviction.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley was soon removed from school and continued his own education\r\nfor several years, by reading of the most desultory sort. His special\r\ninclinations were towards mechanical problems, and had he been able to\r\nfollow his own wishes there is little doubt but that he would have\r\nentered on the profession of an engineer. It is probable that there\r\nwas a great deal more in his wishes than the familiar inclination of a\r\nclever boy to engineering. All through the pursuit of anatomy, which\r\nwas the chief business of his life, it was the structure of animals,\r\nthe different modifications of great ground-plans which they\r\npresented, that interested him. But the opportunity for engineering\r\ndid not present itself, and at an exceedingly early age he began to\r\nstudy medicine. Two brothers-in-law were doctors, and this accidental\r\nfact probably determined his choice. In these days the study of\r\nmedicine did not begin as now with a general and scientific education,\r\nbut the young medical student was apprenticed to a doctor engaged in\r\npractice. He was supposed to learn the compounding of drugs in the\r\ndispensary attached to the doctor's consulting-room; to be taught the\r\ndressing of wounds and the superficial details of the medical craft\r\nwhile he pursued his studies in anatomy under the direction of the\r\ndoctor. Huxley's master was his brother-in-law, Dr. Salt, a London\r\npractitioner, and he began his work when only twelve or thirteen years\r\nof age. In this system everything depended upon the superior; under\r\nthe careful guidance of a conscientious and able man it was possible\r\nfor an apt pupil to learn a great deal of science and to become an\r\nexpert in the treatment of disease. Huxley, however, had only a short\r\nexperience of this kind of training. He was taken by some senior\r\nstudent friends to a post-mortem examination, and although then, as\r\nall through his life, he was most sensitive to the disagreeable side\r\nof anatomical pursuits, on this occasion he gratified his curiosity\r\ntoo ardently. He did not cut himself, but in some way poisonous matter\r\nfrom the body affected him, and he fell into so bad a state of health\r\nthat he had to be sent into the country to recruit. He lived for some\r\ntime at a farmhouse in Warwickshire with friends of his father and\r\nslowly recovered health. From that time, however, all through his\r\nlife, he suffered periodically from prostrating dyspepsia. After some\r\nmonths devoted to promiscuous reading he resumed his work under his\r\nbrother-in-law in London. He confesses that he was far from a model\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\n     \"I worked extremely hard when it pleased me, and when it did\r\n     not,--which was a frequent case,--I was extremely idle (unless\r\n     making caricatures of one's pastors and masters is to be called a\r\n     branch of industry), or else wasted my energies in wrong\r\n     directions. I read everything I could lay hands upon, including\r\n     novels, and took up all sorts of pursuits to drop them again\r\n     quite speedily.\"\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain, however, that Huxley underestimated the value of\r\nthis time. He stored his mind with both literature and science, and\r\nlaid the foundation of the extremely varied intellectual interests\r\nwhich afterwards proved to him of so much value. It is certain, also,\r\nthat during this time he acquired a fair knowledge of French and\r\nGerman. It would be difficult to exaggerate the value to him of this\r\naddition to his weapons for attacking knowledge. To do the best work\r\nin any scientific pursuit it is necessary to freshen one's own mind by\r\ncontact with the ideas and results of other workers. As these workers\r\nare scattered over different countries it is necessary to transcend\r\nthe confusion of Babel and read what they write in their own tongues.\r\nWhen Huxley was young, the great reputation of Cuvier overshadowed\r\nEnglish anatomy, and English anatomists did little more than seek in\r\nnature what Cuvier had taught them to find. In Germany other men and\r\nother ideas were to be found. Johannes Mueller and Von Baer were\r\nattacking the problems of nature in a spirit that was entirely\r\ndifferent, and Huxley, by combining what he was taught in England with\r\nwhat he learned from German methods, came to his own investigations\r\nwith a wider mind. But his conquest of French and German brought with\r\nit advantages in addition to these technical gains. There is no reason\r\nto believe that he troubled himself with grammatical details and with\r\nthe study of these languages as subjects in themselves. He acquired\r\nthem simply to discover the new ideas concealed in them, and he by no\r\nmeans confined himself to the reading of foreign books on the subjects\r\nof his own studies. He read French and German poetry, literature, and\r\nphilosophy, and so came to have a knowledge of the ideas of those\r\noutside his own race on all the great problems that interest mankind.\r\nA good deal has been written as to the narrowing tendency of\r\nscientific pursuits, but with Huxley, as with all the scientific men\r\nthe present writer has known, the mechanical necessity of learning to\r\nread other languages has brought with it that wide intellectual\r\nsympathy which is the beginning of all culture and which is not\r\ninfrequently missed by those who have devoted themselves to many\r\ngrammars and a single literature. The old proverb, \"Whatever is worth\r\ndoing is worth doing well,\" has only value when \"well\" is properly\r\ninterpreted. Although the science of language is as great as any\r\nscience, it is not the science of language, but the practical\r\ninterpretation of it, that is of value to most people, and there is\r\nmuch to be said for the method of anatomists like Huxley, who passed\r\nlightly over grammatical _minutiæ_ and went straight with a dictionary\r\nto the reading of each new tongue.\r\n\r\nAfter a short period of apprenticeship, or sometimes during the\r\ncourse of it, the young medical students \"walked\" a hospital. This\r\nconsisted in attending the demonstrations of the physicians and\r\nsurgeons in the wards of the hospital and in pursuing anatomical,\r\nchemical, and physiological study in the medical school attached to\r\nthe hospital. A large fee was charged for the complete course, but at\r\nmany of the hospitals there were entrance scholarships which relieved\r\nthose who gained them of all cost. In 1842 Huxley and his elder\r\nbrother, James, applied for such free scholarships at Charing Cross\r\nHospital. There is no record in the books of the hospital as to what\r\npersons supported the application. The entry in the minutes for\r\nSeptember 6, 1842, states that\r\n\r\n     \"Applications from the following gentlemen (including the two\r\n     sons of Mr. George Huxley, late senior assistant master in Ealing\r\n     School), were laid before the meeting, and their testimonials\r\n     being approved of, it was decided that those gentlemen should be\r\n     admitted as free scholars, if their classical attainments should\r\n     be found upon examination to be satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that the two Huxleys were able to satisfy the probably\r\nunexacting demands of the classical examiners, for they began their\r\nhospital work in October of the same year.\r\n\r\nThose who know the magnificent laboratories and lecture-rooms which\r\nhave grown up in connection with the larger London hospitals must have\r\ndifficulty in realising the humble arrangements for teaching students\r\nin the early forties. What endowments there were--and Charing Cross\r\nwas never a richly endowed hospital--were devoted entirely to the\r\nhospital as opposed to the teaching school. There were no separate\r\nbuildings for anatomy, physiology, and so forth. At Charing Cross the\r\ndissecting-room was in a cellar under the hospital, and subjects like\r\nchemistry, botany, physiology, and so forth were crowded into\r\ninconvenient side rooms. The teachers were not specialists, devoting\r\ntheir whole attention to particular branches of science, but were\r\ndoctors engaged in practice, who, in addition to their private duties\r\nand their work at the hospital, each undertook to lecture upon a\r\nspecial scientific subject. Huxley came specially under the influence\r\nof Mr. Wharton Jones, who had begun to teach physiology at the\r\nhospital a year before. Mr. Jones throughout his life was engaged in\r\nprofessional work, his specialty being ophthalmic surgery, but he was\r\na devoted student of anatomy and physiology, and made several\r\nclassical contributions to scientific knowledge, his best-known\r\ndiscoveries relating to blood corpuscles and to the nature of the\r\nmammalian egg-cell. But perhaps his greatest claim to fame is that it\r\nwas he who first imbued Huxley with a love for anatomical science and\r\nwith a knowledge of the methods of investigation. At the end of his\r\nfirst session, in 1843, Huxley received the first prize in the senior\r\nphysiology class, while his brother got a \"good conduct\" prize. Of\r\nWharton Jones Huxley writes:\r\n\r\n     \"The extent and precision of his knowledge impressed me greatly,\r\n     and the severe exactness of his method of lecturing was quite to\r\n     my taste. I do not know that I have ever felt so much respect for\r\n     anybody as a teacher before or since. I worked hard to obtain his\r\n     approbation, and he was extremely kind and helpful to the\r\n     youngster who, I am afraid, took up more of his time than he had\r\n     any right to do. It was he who suggested the publication of my\r\n     first scientific paper--a very little one--in the _Medical\r\n     Gazette_ of 1845, and most kindly corrected the literary faults\r\n     which abounded in it short as it was. For at that time, and for\r\n     many years afterwards, I detested the trouble of writing and\r\n     would take no pains over it.\"\r\n\r\nThis little paper, although Huxley deprecates it, was remarkable as\r\nthe work of so young an investigator. In it he demonstrated the\r\nexistence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner root-sheath of\r\nhairs, a layer that has been known since as Huxley's layer.\r\n\r\nThere is no record in the minutes of the hospital school that Huxley\r\ngained any other school prizes. His name reappears only in formal\r\napplications at the beginning of each session for the renewal of his\r\nfree scholarship. In this respect he is in marked contrast to his\r\nfellow-student, afterwards Sir Joseph Fayrer, who appears to have\r\ntaken almost every prize open to him. On the other hand, his\r\nattainments in anatomy and physiology brought him distinction in a\r\nwider field than the hospital school, for he obtained, in the\r\n\"honours\" division of the first examination for the degree of Bachelor\r\nof Medicine at the University of London, the second place with a\r\nmedal. And it is certain that he was far from neglecting his strictly\r\nprofessional work, although, no doubt, he devoted much time to reading\r\nand research in pure science, for in the winter of 1845-46, having\r\ncompleted his course at the hospital, he was prepared to offer himself\r\nat the examination for the membership of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons; but, being as yet under twenty-one years of age, could not\r\nbe admitted as a candidate.\r\n\r\nIt was now time for Huxley definitely to enter on his profession. He\r\nwould have preferred to continue his investigations in London and to\r\nwait for the chance of a teaching post in physiology, but it was\r\nnecessary to earn a living. One of those whom he consulted was his\r\nfellow-student, Joseph Fayrer, who, hailing from Bermuda, knew\r\nsomething of those who go down to the sea in ships. He advised Huxley\r\nto write to Sir William Burnett, at that time Director-General for the\r\nmedical service of the navy, for an appointment.\r\n\r\n     \"I thought this rather a strong thing to do,\" says Huxley in his\r\n     autobiography, \"as Sir William was personally unknown to me; but\r\n     my cheery friend would not listen to my scruples, so I went to my\r\n     lodgings and wrote the best letter I could devise. A few days\r\n     afterwards I received the usual official circular of\r\n     acknowledgement, but at the bottom was written an instruction to\r\n     call at Somerset House on such a day. I thought that looked like\r\n     business, so, at the appointed time I called and sent in my card,\r\n     while I waited in Sir William's ante-room. He was a tall,\r\n     shrewd-looking old gentleman, with a broad Scotch accent--and I\r\n     think I see him now as he entered with my card in his hand. The\r\n     first thing he did was to return it with the frugal reminder that\r\n     I should probably find it useful on some other occasion. The\r\n     second was to ask whether I was an Irishman. I suppose the air of\r\n     modesty about my appeal must have struck him. I satisfied the\r\n     Director-General that I was English to the backbone, and he made\r\n     some enquiries as to my student career, finally desiring me to\r\n     hold myself ready for examination. Having passed this, I was in\r\n     Her Majesty's service, and entered on the books of Nelson's old\r\n     ship, the _Victory_, for duty at Haslar Hospital, about a couple\r\n     of months after I made my application.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time he passed the examination of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons and so became a fully qualified medical man. Haslar Hospital\r\nwas the chief naval hospital to which invalided sailors were sent.\r\nThere was a considerable staff of young surgeons, as navy surgeons\r\nwere usually sent for a term to work in the hospital before being\r\ngazetted to a ship in commission. In connection with the hospital,\r\nthere was a museum of natural history containing a collection of\r\nconsiderable importance slowly gathered from the gifts of sailors and\r\nofficers. The museum curator was an enthusiastic naturalist, and\r\nHuxley must have had the opportunity of extending his knowledge of at\r\nleast the external characters of many forms of life hitherto unknown\r\nto him. A few years later, the curator of the museum, with the help of\r\ntwo of Huxley's successors, published a _Manual of Natural History for\r\nthe Use of Travellers_, and it is certain that Huxley at least did not\r\nlose at Haslar any of the enthusiasm for zoölogy with which he had\r\nbeen inspired at the Charing Cross Hospital. The chief of the hospital\r\nwas Sir John Richardson, an excellent naturalist, and well known as an\r\narctic explorer. He seems to have recognised the peculiar ability of\r\nhis young assistant, and although he was a silent, reserved man, who\r\nseldom encouraged his assistants by talking to them, he made several\r\nattempts to obtain a suitable post for Huxley. Such a post was that of\r\nsurgeon to H.M.S. _Rattlesnake_, then about to start under the command\r\nof Captain Owen Stanley for surveying work in the Torres Straits.\r\nCaptain Stanley had expressed a wish for a surgeon who knew something\r\nof science, and, on the recommendation of Sir John Richardson,\r\nobtained the post for Huxley. There was, however, to be a special\r\nnaturalist attached to the expedition, but Huxley had the opportunity\r\nhe wanted. After a brief stay of seven months at the Haslar Hospital\r\nhe left it for his ship, and thus definitely entered on his work in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This and many other details in this chapter are taken\r\nfrom an autobiographical sketch in the first volume of Huxley's\r\ncollected essays published by Macmillan, London, 1894.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE OF THE \"RATTLESNAKE\"\r\n\r\n     The Objects of the Voyage--The Route--The Naturalist and the\r\n     Surgeon--Collecting and Dredging--Stay in Sydney--Adventures with\r\n     the Natives--Comparison with Darwin's Voyage on the _Beagle_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's ship the _Rattlesnake_, one of the old class of 28-gun\r\nships, sailed from Plymouth for the Torres Straits and the Australian\r\nseas on December 12, 1846. Her commander was Captain Owen Stanley, a\r\nyoung but distinguished officer, the son of the Bishop of Norwich and\r\na brother of Dean Stanley, who afterwards played so great a part in\r\nthe social and religious history of England. She carried a complement\r\nof 180 officers and men, and was attended by the _Bramble_ and the\r\n_Castlereagh_, two small vessels of light draught, whose purpose was\r\nto precede her in shallow waters. The young colonies of Australia were\r\ndeveloping commerce with the mother country, and the business of the\r\n_Rattlesnake_ was to survey the waters round about the Torres Straits,\r\nthat the passage towards India on the homeward trip might be made\r\nsafer. Incidentally the vessel was to land a treasure of £50,000 at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and another of £15,000 at the Mauritius. The\r\nAdmiralty Commissioners left full powers to Captain Stanley to carry\r\nout the details of his mission according to his own judgment, but he\r\nwas solemnly warned upon two points. Many very unfortunate casualties\r\nhad occurred when sailors came in contact with the little-known\r\nsavages of the southern seas, and the Admiralty instructed him as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"In stretching off from the Barrier Reefs to the eastward, in\r\n     order to explore the safety of the sea intervening between them\r\n     and Louisiade and New Guinea, you will have occasion to approach\r\n     these shores, in which case you must constantly be on your guard\r\n     against the treacherous disposition of their inhabitants. All\r\n     barter for refreshments must be conducted under the eye of an\r\n     officer, and every pains be taken to avoid giving any just cause\r\n     of offence to their prejudices, especially with respect to their\r\n     women.\"\r\n\r\nThe second warning concerned grave international matters. European\r\npolitics were in the unsettled condition which, after the illusive\r\ninternational courtesies of the Great Exhibition of 1851, ended in the\r\nCrimean War, and it was feared that in the event of hostilities\r\nbreaking out, the zeal of the officers for their country might tempt\r\nthem to transcend their peaceful occupation. The instructions with\r\nregard to this ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"In the event of this country being involved in hostilities\r\n     during your absence, you will take care never to be surprised;\r\n     but you are to refrain from any act of aggression towards the\r\n     vessels or settlements of any nation with which we may be at war,\r\n     as expeditions employed on behalf of discovery and science have\r\n     always been considered by all civilised communities as acting\r\n     under a general safeguard.\"\r\n\r\nThe great scientific expeditions sent out in recent times by the\r\ngovernments of Britain, Germany, and the United States, were fitted\r\nwith every convenience for the staff of naturalists, and the luxuries\r\nand comforts of civilisation attended them round the world. The late\r\nProfessor Mosely, for instance, who was a naturalist on the English\r\n_Challenger_ expedition, told the present writer of a pleasant way in\r\nwhich a peculiarity of the deep sea was made to pay toll to the\r\ncomfort of those on board ship. The great ocean depths all over the\r\nworld, under the burning skies of the tropics, or below the arctic\r\nice-fields, are extremely cold, the water at the bottom always being\r\nonly a few degrees above freezing point. When the dredge brought up a\r\nsample of the abysmal mud at a convenient time, it was used to ice the\r\nwine for the officers' mess. There was, however, no cooled champagne\r\nfor Huxley.\r\n\r\n     \"Life on board Her Majesty's ships in those days,\" he writes,\r\n     \"was a very different affair from what it is now, and ours was\r\n     exceptionally rough, as we were often many months without\r\n     receiving letters or seeing any civilised people but ourselves.\r\n     In exchange, we had the interest of being about the latest\r\n     voyagers, I suppose, to whom it could be possible to meet with\r\n     people who knew nothing of fire-arms--as we did on the south\r\n     coast of New Guinea--and of making acquaintances with a variety\r\n     of interesting savage and semi-civilised people. But apart from\r\n     experience of this kind, and the opportunities offered for\r\n     scientific work, to me personally the cruise was extremely\r\n     valuable. It was good for me to live under sharp discipline; to\r\n     be down on the realities of existence by living on bare\r\n     necessities; to find out how extremely well worth living life\r\n     seemed to be when one woke up from a night's rest on a soft plank\r\n     with the sky for canopy, and cocoa and weevilly biscuit the sole\r\n     prospect for breakfast; and more especially to learn to work for\r\n     the sake of what I got for myself out of it, even if it all went\r\n     to the bottom and I myself along with it. My brother officers\r\n     were as good fellows as sailors ought to be, and generally are,\r\n     but naturally they neither knew nor cared anything about my\r\n     pursuits, nor understood why I should be so zealous in pursuit\r\n     of the objects which my friends the middies christened 'Buffons,'\r\n     after the title conspicuous on a volume of the _Suites à Buffon_\r\n     which stood on my shelf in the chart-room.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley was only the surgeon on board the _Rattlesnake_, and his\r\npursuit of natural history was his own affair. There was a special\r\nnaturalist appointed to the expedition, no doubt chosen because four\r\nyears earlier, as assistant to Professor Jukes, he had been attached\r\nas naturalist to the expedition of the _Fly_ in the same waters. His\r\nname was John MacGillivray, and he was the son of an exceedingly able\r\nnaturalist whose reputation has been overshadowed by the greater names\r\nof the middle century. William MacGillivray, the father, sometime\r\nprofessor at the University of Aberdeen, was one of those driven by an\r\nalmost instinctive desire to the study of nature. In his youth, when\r\nhe was a poor lad, desiring to see as much as possible of his native\r\nland, and above all to visit the great museums and libraries of the\r\nsouth, he walked from Aberdeen to London with no luggage but a copy of\r\nSmith's _Flora Britannica_. He was an ardent botanist, a collector of\r\ninsects and molluscs, and one of the pioneers in the anatomy of birds.\r\nThere are many curious allusions in his writings which seem to shew\r\nthat he too was beginning to doubt the fixity of species, and to guess\r\nat the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest which the\r\ngreat Darwin was the first to make a part of the knowledge of the\r\nworld. It must be confessed that his son John, the companion of\r\nHuxley, had little of his father's ability. He was three years older\r\nthan Huxley, and broke off his medical course at the University of\r\nEdinburgh to sail in the _Fly_. After the return of the _Rattlesnake_,\r\nhe was appointed in 1852 as naturalist to H.M.S. _Herald_, then\r\nstarting under Captain Denham for surveying work round the shores of\r\nSouth America. He left that ship at Sydney, and after many years'\r\nwandering about the southern seas, accounts of which he communicated\r\nfrom time to time to Sydney newspapers, he died in 1867. He was a\r\nzealous collector of plants and animals, but apparently cared little\r\nfor the study of his captures, either in life, in relation to their\r\nsurroundings, like Darwin, or for the structure of their bodies, like\r\nHuxley. The somewhat unpleasing nature of his regard for animals\r\nappears in the following story which he himself tells:\r\n\r\n     \"While at dinner off Darnley Island near the Torres Straits, news\r\n     was brought that Dzum was under the stern in a canoe, shouting\r\n     out loudly for Dzoka (MacGillivray's native name), and, on going\r\n     up I found that he had brought off the barit, which after a deal\r\n     of trouble I struck a bargain for and obtained. It was a very\r\n     fine specimen of Cuscus Maculatus, quite tame and kept in a large\r\n     cage of split bamboo. Dzum seemed very unwilling to part with the\r\n     animal, and repeatedly enjoined me to take great care of it and\r\n     feed it well, which to please him I promised to do, although I\r\n     valued it merely for its skin, and was resolved to kill it for\r\n     that purpose at my first convenience.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, MacGillivray paid great attention to native\r\nlanguages, and collected vocabularies of some value. To him was\r\nentrusted the task of writing an account of the voyage, and it is from\r\nhis rather dull pages, brightened by illustrations from Huxley's\r\nsketches, that the incidents of the voyage are taken. The references\r\nto Huxley in the narrative are slight, and seem to shew that no great\r\nintimacy existed between the two young men, the one a naturalist by\r\nprofession, the other as yet a surgeon, but more devoted to natural\r\nhistory than the naturalist. Such references as occur relate to\r\nHuxley's constant occupations on shore, sketching natives and their\r\ndwellings, and his apparatus on board for trawling, dredging, and\r\ndissecting.\r\n\r\nThe voyage out was uneventful. The ship touched at Madeira and at Rio\r\nde Janeiro, and then crossed the South Atlantic to Simon's Town at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, where the first quantity of treasure was to be\r\nlanded. There they found the colony distressed by the long continuance\r\nof the Kaffir war. Prices for everything were extortionate, and the\r\ncolonists had no mind for any affairs than their own, so after a short\r\nstay the voyagers were glad to set out for the Mauritius. That island,\r\nalthough in the possession of Britain, still retained a strong impress\r\nof its French occupation, and the travellers were interested by the\r\nmixture of population inhabiting it.[B]\r\n\r\n     \"Passing through the closely packed lines of shipping, and\r\n     landing as a stranger at Port Louis, perhaps the first thing to\r\n     engage attention is the strange mixture of\r\n     nations,--representatives, he might at first be inclined to\r\n     imagine, of half the countries of the earth. He stares at a\r\n     coolie from Madras with a breech-cloth and a soldier's jacket, or\r\n     a stately bearded Moor striking a bargain with a Parsee merchant.\r\n     A Chinaman with two bundles slung on a bamboo hurries past,\r\n     jostling a group of young Creole exquisites smoking their\r\n     cheroots at a corner, and talking of last night's Norma, or the\r\n     programme of the evening's performance at the Hippodrome in the\r\n     Champ de Mars. His eye next catches a couple of sailors reeling\r\n     out of a grogshop, to the amusement of a group of laughing\r\n     negresses, in white muslin dresses of the latest Parisian\r\n     fashion, contrasting strongly with a modestly attired Cingalese\r\n     woman, and an Indian ayah with her young charge. Amidst all this,\r\n     the French language prevails; and everything more or less\r\n     pertains of the French character, and an Englishman can scarcely\r\n     believe that he is in one of the colonies of his own country.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Mauritius they proceeded to the English-looking colony of\r\nTasmania, and after a few days set out for Sydney, arriving there on\r\nJuly 16th. The surveying officers had tedious work to do there, and\r\nHuxley stayed in Sydney for three months. Then, and in the course of\r\nthree other prolonged stays in that town during the expedition, Huxley\r\nentered into the society of the town and became a general favourite.\r\nHe is still remembered there, and the accompanying illustration[C] is\r\na copy of an original sketch of himself, now in the possession of an\r\nAustralian lady. He drew it on the fly-leaf of a volume of Lytton's\r\npoems and presented it on her birthday to the little daughter of a\r\nfriend. At Sydney, too, he met and gained the love of the lady, then\r\nMiss Henrietta A. Heathorn, who afterwards became his wife.\r\n\r\nOn October 11th the _Rattlesnake_ sailed northwards to begin the real\r\nwork of the expedition. The great island of New Guinea, lying to the\r\nnorth of Australia, is separated from it only by the comparatively\r\nnarrow Torres Straits. Through these lies the natural route for the\r\ncommerce between Australia and the Northern Hemisphere. The eastward\r\nprolongation of New Guinea, and the coast of Queensland, enclose\r\nbetween them a great tropical sea which gradually converges to the\r\nStraits. The waters are very tempestuous, and the navigation is made\r\nmore dangerous by the thousands of coral islands and coral reefs that\r\nstud the ocean. Following the shoreline of Queensland, at a distance\r\nof from ten to one hundred and fifty miles, and stretching for twelve\r\nhundred and fifty miles, is the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, one\r\nof the wonders of the world. The shelving floor of the ocean rises\r\nnearly to the surface along this line, and vast colonies of coral\r\nbuilding creatures have formed their reefs up to the water's edge\r\nalong the ridge. The turbulent waves scouring over this living mass\r\nhave carved and moulded it into millions of fantastic islands,\r\nsometimes heaping detached masses of dead debris high above the\r\nsurface of the water. At low tide the most wonderful fields of the\r\nanimal flowers of the sea are exposed. Some of them form branching\r\nsystems of hard skeletons like stony trees, the soft, brightly\r\ncoloured animals dotted over the stems like buds. Others form solid\r\nmasses; others, again, rounded skull like boulders, or elevations like\r\ntoadstools. The colours of the skeletons and the animals are vivid\r\nscarlets and purples and greens. Sea anemones, shell-fish, and\r\nstarfish of the most vivid hues are as abundant as the corals.\r\nBrilliant fish dart through the blossoms of the marine gardens, and\r\nsea birds scream and wheel in the air. The whole region is a paradise\r\nfor the naturalist. Along the seaward side of the reef the great ocean\r\nsurges and thunders perpetually. Between it and the shore the quiet\r\nchannel glows under the tropical skies. It was amid such scenes as\r\nthese that the _Rattlesnake_ moved for nearly four years in the slow\r\nwork of taking soundings, fixing the exact position of channels\r\nthrough the outer reef by slow triangular measurements, and generally\r\npreparing for the safety of the commerce of all nations. The ship went\r\nfirst up to Port Curtis in Brisbane; then fetched back to Sydney. Its\r\nnext trip was south to the strait between Tasmania and Australia,\r\nthen back to Sydney; then again along the Barrier Reef right up to the\r\nTorres Straits. After work there, it returned again to Sydney, and\r\nthen set out for the Louisiade Archipelago, which stretches through\r\nthe coral sea south-eastward from New Guinea; then again to the\r\nAustralian shores of the Torres Straits, and finally arrived in Sydney\r\nin March, 1850, where the Captain suddenly died, and the ship was\r\nordered to return to England.\r\n\r\nThroughout the voyage MacGillivray and Huxley busied themselves with\r\ncollecting animals on sea and on shore. MacGillivray seems to have\r\ntaken for his share of the spoil chiefly such animals as provided\r\nshells or skins or skeletons suitable for handing over to museums.\r\nHuxley occupied himself incessantly with dissecting tools and with the\r\nmicroscope, with results to be described in a later chapter. The\r\nbetter equipped expeditions of modern times were provided with\r\nelaborate appliances for bringing up samples of living creatures from\r\nall depths of the floor of the ocean, and with complicated towing nets\r\nfor securing the floating creatures of the surface of the seas. The\r\n_Rattlesnake_ naturalists had to content themselves with simple\r\napparatus devised by themselves. At an early period of the voyage\r\nattempts were made to take deep soundings, but no bottom was reached\r\nat a depth of two thousand four hundred fathoms, and their later work\r\nwas confined to surface animals or to inshore dredging in shallow\r\nwaters. They began near Rio.\r\n\r\n     \"None of the ship's boats could be spared, so I [MacGillivray]\r\n     hired one pulled by four negro slaves who, although strong,\r\n     active fellows, had great objections to straining their backs at\r\n     the oar, when the dredge was down. No sieve having been\r\n     supplied, we were obliged to sift the contents of the dredge\r\n     through our hands--a tedious and superficial mode of examination.\r\n     Two days after, Mr. Huxley and I set to work in Botafogo Bay,\r\n     provided with a wire-gauze meat-cover and a curious machine for\r\n     cleaning rice; these answered capitally as substitutes for\r\n     sieves, and enabled us, by a thorough examination of the contents\r\n     of the dredge, to detect some forty-five species of Mollusca and\r\n     Radiata, some of which were new to science.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"new to science\" MacGillivray meant no more than that the\r\nparticular genera and species had not been captured before. Huxley, by\r\nhis anatomical work, showed many of the most familiar creatures in a\r\nlight \"new to science,\" by revealing their true structure and\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\n     \"Among the acquisitions,\" MacGillivray goes on, \"I may mention a\r\n     new species of Amphioxus, a genus of small fishes exhibiting more\r\n     anomalies than any other known to Ichthyologists, and the lowest\r\n     organisation found in the class. It somewhat resembles the\r\n     sand-eels of Britain in habits, like them moving with\r\n     extraordinary rapidity through the sand. By dint of bribery and\r\n     ridicule we had at length managed to get our boatmen to work\r\n     tolerably well, and when we were alike well-roasted by the sun\r\n     and repeatedly drenched, besides being tired out and hungry, they\r\n     had become quite submissive, and exchanged their grumbling for\r\n     merriment.\"\r\n\r\nThe towing net repeatedly produced a rich harvest. It was constructed\r\nby themselves, and consisted of a bag of the bunting used for flags,\r\ntwo feet deep, the mouth being sewn round a wooden hoop fourteen\r\ninches in diameter; three pieces of cord, a foot and a half long, were\r\nsecured to the hoop at equal intervals and had their ends tied\r\ntogether. This net was towed behind the ship by a stout cord. The\r\nwater passed through the meshes of the cloth and left behind in the\r\npocket any small floating animals.\r\n\r\nExcursions ashore to the little savage islands or to the mainland were\r\na source of constant interest, and it cannot be doubted that the\r\nacquaintance Huxley thus gained with many of the very low savages of\r\nAustralia and New Guinea prepared his mind for the revolutionary\r\ndoctrine of descent which he embraced a few years later. At the\r\npresent time, there are probably very few parts of earth where there\r\nare yet to be found savages unaltered by civilisation. Some of the low\r\nraces with which Huxley came in contact are now extinct. All the\r\nsurvivors have come in contact with white races, and their habits and\r\ncustoms have been altered. Before long the total extinction of these\r\nlower races is to be expected, and there will then be left an enormous\r\ngap between the lower animals and the dominant, aggressive, yellow and\r\nwhite races which are spreading over the earth and making the lower\r\nraces perish before them, as the smaller but more cunning European rat\r\nhas exterminated the native brown rat of Australia. In their various\r\nexcursions upon the Australian mainland they had no trouble of any\r\nkind with the natives. These were at first suspicious of the doings of\r\nthe white men, and their total ignorance of the use of firearms\r\ntempted them to rashness; but a few friendly gifts, and the exercise\r\nof tact in negotiating exchanges with them, made all the encounters\r\npass off pleasantly. On the other hand, in the Louisiade Archipelago\r\nwhere the savages were of a higher type, difficulties constantly\r\noccurred. On one occasion, in a bay on the south side of Joannet\r\nIsland the party was attacked.\r\n\r\n     \"In the grey of the morning the look-outs reported the approach\r\n     of three canoes with about ten men in each. On two or three\r\n     persons shewing themselves in the bow of the pinnace, in front of\r\n     the rain awning, the natives ceased paddling, as if baulked in\r\n     their design of surprising the large boat; but, after a short\r\n     consultation, they came alongside in their usual noisy manner.\r\n     After a stay of about five minutes only they pushed off to the\r\n     galley, and some more sham bartering was attempted, but they had\r\n     nothing to give in exchange for the wares they so much coveted.\r\n     In a short time the rudeness and overbearing insolence of the\r\n     natives had risen to a pitch which left no doubt of their hostile\r\n     intentions. The anchor was got up, when some of the blacks seized\r\n     the painter, and others, in trying to capsize the boat, brought\r\n     the gunwale down to the water's edge, at the same time grappling\r\n     with the men to pull them out, and dragging the galley inshore\r\n     towards the shoal-water. The bowman, with the anchor in his hand,\r\n     was struck on the head with a stone-headed axe. The blow was\r\n     repeated, but fortunately took effect only on the wash-streak.\r\n     Another of the crew was struck at with a similar weapon, but\r\n     warded off the blow, although held fast by one arm, when, just as\r\n     the savage was making another stroke, Lieutenant Dayman, who up\r\n     till now had exercised the utmost forbearance, fired at him with\r\n     a musket. The man did not drop, although wounded in the thigh.\r\n     But even this, unquestionably their first experience of firearms,\r\n     did not intimidate the natives, one of whom, standing on a block\r\n     of coral, threw a spear which passed across the breast of one of\r\n     the boat's crew and lodged in the bend of one arm, opening a\r\n     vein. They raised a loud shout when the spear was seen to take\r\n     effect, and threw several others which missed. Lieutenant\r\n     Simpson, who had been watching what was going on, then fired from\r\n     the pinnace with buckshot and struck them, when, finding that the\r\n     large boat, though at anchor, could assist the smaller one, the\r\n     canoes were paddled inshore in great haste and confusion. Some\r\n     more musket shots were fired, and the galley went in chase\r\n     endeavouring to turn the canoes, so as to bring them under fire\r\n     of the pinnace's twelve-pounder howitzer, which was speedily\r\n     mounted and fired. The shot either struck one of the canoes or\r\n     went within a few inches of the mark, on which the natives\r\n     instantly jumped overboard into the shallow water, making for the\r\n     mangroves, which they succeeded in reaching, dragging their\r\n     canoes with them. Two rounds of grape-shot crashing through the\r\n     branches dispersed the party, but afterwards they moved two of\r\n     the canoes out of sight. The remaining one was brought out after\r\n     breakfast by the galley under cover of the pinnace, and was towed\r\n     off to some distance. The paddles having been taken out and the\r\n     spears broken and left in her, she was let go to drift down\r\n     toward a village whence the attacking party were supposed to have\r\n     come. Some blood in this canoe, although not the one most aimed\r\n     at, showed that the firing had not been ineffective. This act of\r\n     deliberate treachery was perpetrated by persons who had always\r\n     been well treated by us, for several of the natives present were\r\n     recognised as having been alongside the ship in Coral Haven.\r\n     This, their first act of positive hostility, affords, I think,\r\n     conclusive evidence of the savage disposition of the natives of\r\n     this part of the Louisiade Archipelago when incited by the hope\r\n     of plunder, and shews that no confidence should ever be reposed\r\n     in them, unless, perhaps in the presence of a numerically\r\n     superior force, or in the close vicinity of a ship. At the same\r\n     time, the boldness of these savages in attacking, with thirty men\r\n     in three canoes, two boats known to contain at least twenty\r\n     persons--even in the hopes of taking them by surprise--and in not\r\n     being at once driven off upon feeling the novel and deadly\r\n     effects of firearms, shews no little amount of bravery.\"\r\n\r\nOn their last visit to Cape York, in the extreme north of Australia,\r\nthe party had the remarkable experience of rescuing a white woman from\r\ncaptivity among the natives.\r\n\r\n     \"In the afternoon some of our people on shore were surprised to\r\n     see a young white woman come up to claim their protection from a\r\n     party of natives from whom she had recently made her escape, and\r\n     who she thought would otherwise bring her back. Of course she\r\n     received every attention, and was taken on board the ship by the\r\n     first boat, when she told her story which is briefly as follows:\r\n     Her name is Barbara Thomson. She was born at Aberdeen in\r\n     Scotland, and, along with her parents, emigrated to New South\r\n     Wales. About four years and a half ago she left Moreton Bay with\r\n     her husband in a small cutter, called the _America_, of which he\r\n     was the owner, for the purpose of picking up some of the oil from\r\n     the wreck of a whaler, lost on the Bampton shoal, to which place\r\n     one of her late crew undertook to guide them; their ultimate\r\n     intention was to go on to Port Essington. The man who acted as\r\n     pilot was unable to find the wreck, and after much quarreling on\r\n     board in consequence, and the loss of two men by drowning and of\r\n     another who was left on a small uninhabited island, they made\r\n     their way up to the Torres Straits, where, during a gale of wind\r\n     their vessel struck upon a reef on the eastern Prince of Wales\r\n     Island. The two remaining men were lost in attempting to swim on\r\n     shore through the surf, but the woman was afterwards rescued by a\r\n     party of natives on a turtling excursion, who, when the gale\r\n     subsided, swam on board and supported her on shore between two of\r\n     their number. One of these blacks, Boroto by name, took\r\n     possession of the woman as his share of the plunder; she was\r\n     compelled to live with him, but was well treated by all the men,\r\n     although many of the women, jealous of the attention shewn her,\r\n     for a long time evinced anything but kindness. A curious\r\n     circumstance secured for her the protection of one of the\r\n     principal men of the tribe. This person, acting upon the belief,\r\n     universal throughout Australia and the islands of the Torres\r\n     Strait, so far as hitherto known, that white people are the\r\n     ghosts of the aborigines, fancied that in the stranger he\r\n     recognised a long-lost daughter, and at once admitted her into\r\n     the relationship which he thought had formerly subsisted between\r\n     them. She was immediately acknowledged by the whole tribe as one\r\n     of themselves, thus securing an extensive connection in relatives\r\n     of all denominations. The headquarters of the tribe being on an\r\n     island which all vessels passing through the Torres Strait from\r\n     the eastward must approach within two or three miles, she had the\r\n     mortification of seeing from twenty to thirty or more ships go\r\n     through every summer without anchoring in the neighbourhood, so\r\n     as to afford the slightest opportunity of making her escape. Last\r\n     year she heard of our two vessels being at Cape York, only twenty\r\n     miles distant from some of the tribe who had communicated with us\r\n     and had been well treated, but they would not take her over and\r\n     watched her even more narrowly than before. On our second and\r\n     present visit, however, which the Cape York people immediately\r\n     announced by smoke signals to their friends, she was successful\r\n     in persuading some of her more immediate friends to bring her\r\n     across to the mainland within a short distance of where the\r\n     vessels lay. The blacks were credulous enough to believe that as\r\n     she had been so long with them and had been so well treated, she\r\n     did not intend to leave them,--only 'she felt a strong desire to\r\n     see the white people once more and shake hands with them': adding\r\n     that she would be certain to purchase some axes, knives, tobacco,\r\n     and other much-prized articles.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the external adventures of the _Rattlesnake_ party were less\r\nvaried and exciting than might have been expected in a voyage of four\r\nyears in the tropic seas and among barbarian tribes, the mental\r\nadventures through which Huxley passed in the time must have been of\r\nthe most surprising kind. It was a four-years' course in the great\r\nuniversity of nature, and when he had finished it he was no longer a\r\nmere student, capricious and unsettled in his mental tastes and\r\ninclinations, but had set his face steadily towards his future\r\nlife-work. It is interesting to compare the importance in Huxley's\r\nlife of the _Rattlesnake_ voyage with the importance in Darwin's life\r\nof the voyage on the _Beagle_ undertaken some fifteen years earlier.\r\nHuxley, when he started, was a young surgeon with a taste of a vague\r\nkind for dissecting and for drawing the peculiarities of structure of\r\ndifferent animals revealed by the knife and the microscope. Day after\r\nday, month after month, year after year, in the abundant leisure his\r\nslight professional duties left him, he dissected and drew, dissected\r\nand drew, animal after animal, as he got them from the dredge or\r\ntow-net, or from the surface of the coral reefs. He was not in any\r\nsense of the word a collecting naturalist. The identification and\r\nnaming of species interested him little. What he cared for was, he\r\ntells us, \"the architectural and engineering part of the business: the\r\nworking out of the wonderful unity of plan in the thousands and\r\nthousands of divers living constructions, and the modifications of\r\nsimilar apparatuses to serve different ends.\" And so, on the\r\n_Rattlesnake_, and in his work in continuation of the _Rattlesnake_\r\ninvestigations,--which occupied most of his time for a few years after\r\nhis return to London,--there was gradually growing up in his mind a\r\ndim conception of the animal kingdom as a group of creatures, not\r\nbuilt on half a dozen or more separate plans or types, each\r\nunconnected with the other, but as a varied set of modifications of a\r\nsingle type.\r\n\r\nWhen Darwin set out on the _Beagle_, unlike Huxley, he was an\r\nenthusiastic collecting naturalist. He had wandered from county to\r\ncounty in England adding new specimens to his collections of\r\nbutterflies and beetles. As the _Beagle_ went round the world visiting\r\nremote islands, far from land in the centre of the waters,\r\narchipelagoes of islands crowding together, islands hugging the shore\r\nof continents, and the great continents of the old and new worlds, he\r\ncontinued to collect and to classify. Gradually the resemblances and\r\ndifferences between the creatures inhabiting different parts of the\r\nearth began to strike him as exhibiting an orderly plan. He saw that\r\nunder apparently the same conditions of food and temperature and\r\nmoisture, in different parts of the world the genera and species were\r\ndifferent, and that they were most alike in regions between which\r\nthere was the most recent chance of migrations having taken place. In\r\nthe quietness of England, while Huxley was on the _Rattlesnake_,\r\nDarwin was slowly working towards the explanation of all he had seen:\r\ntowards the conception that animals and plants had spread slowly from\r\ncommon centres, becoming more and more different from each other as\r\nthey spread. He realised on his voyage that species had come into\r\nexistence by descent with modification, and before long he was to\r\npublish to the world in the _Origin of Species_ a vast and convincing\r\nbulk of evidence as to the actual fact of a common descent for all the\r\ndifferent existing organisms, and, in his theory of natural selection,\r\na reasonable explanation of how the fact of evolution had come about.\r\nDarwin's greatest ally in bringing the new idea before the world was\r\nHuxley, and Huxley was teaching himself the absolute unity of the\r\nliving world. The two men were dissimilar in tastes and temperament,\r\nand they were at work on quite different sides of nature. When the\r\ntime came, Huxley, with his commanding knowledge of the structure of\r\nanimals, was ready to support Darwin and to illustrate and amplify his\r\narguments by a thousand anatomical proofs. It is a curious and\r\ndramatic coincidence to realise that both men learned their very\r\ndifferent lessons under very similar circumstances in the tropical\r\nseas of the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: _Narrative of the Voyage of H.M.S. \"Rattlesnake_,\" by\r\nJohn MacGillivray, F.R.G.S. 2 vols.

Sometimes, as in high\r\nlatitudes, the cold is so great that only the simplest microscopic\r\nforms are able to maintain existence. In the tropics, animals and\r\nplants are abundant, and sometimes by their numbers colour great areas\r\nof water; or, as in the drift of the Gulf Stream, make a tangle of\r\nanimal and plant life through which a boat travels only with\r\ndifficulty. The basis of the food supply of this vast and hungry\r\nfloating life is, as on land, vegetable life; for plants are the only\r\ncreatures capable of building up food from the gases of the air and\r\nthe simple chemical salts found dissolved in water. Occasionally, in\r\nshallow or warm seas, marine floating plants, large and visible like\r\nthe sea-weeds of the coast, form the floating masses known as Sargasso\r\nseas; more often the plants are minute, microscopic specks visible\r\nonly when a drop of water is placed under the microscope, but\r\noccurring in incredible numbers, and, like the green vegetation of the\r\nearth, forming the ultimate food-supply of all the living things\r\naround them. Innumerable animals, great and small, live on the plants\r\nor upon their fellows, and, however far he may be from land, the\r\nnaturalist has always abundant material got by his daily use of the\r\ntow-net. This drifting population floats at the mercy of the waves.\r\nMost of the animals are delicate, transparent creatures, their\r\ntransparency helping to protect them from the attacks of hungry\r\nfellows. Nerves, muscles, skin, and the organs generally are clear,\r\npale, and hardly visible. Such structures as the liver, the\r\nreproductive organs, and the stomach, which cannot easily become\r\ntransparent, are grouped together into small knots, coloured brown\r\nlike little masses of sea-weed. Other floating creatures are vividly\r\ncoloured, but the hues are bright blues and greens closely similar to\r\nthe sparkling tints of sea-water in sunlight. The different members of\r\nthis marine flotsam frequently rise and fall periodically: some of\r\nthem sinking by day to escape the light, others rising only by day;\r\nothers, again, appearing on the surface in spring, keeping deep down\r\nin winter. Perhaps the majority of them are phosphorescent, sometimes\r\nshining by their own light, sometimes borrowing a glory from\r\ninnumerable phosphorescent bacteria with which they are infested.\r\nNearly every class of the animal kingdom contributes members to this\r\nstrange population. The young forms of many fish, as for instance of\r\nconger, flying gurnards, and some flatfish, are pelagic and have\r\ncolourless blood, and pale, transparent, gelatinous or cartilaginous\r\nskeletons. The tadpole-like stages of the sea-squirts, which in adult\r\nlife are to be found attached to rocks like weeds, drift about in the\r\nsurface waters until their time comes for settling down in life. Many\r\nother Ascidians pass their whole life as pelagic creatures. A few\r\nmolluscs, many kinds of worms, echinoderms, and their allies, crab and\r\nlobster-like creatures in innumerable different stages of development,\r\nare to be found there, while unnumbered polyps and jelly-fish are\r\nalways present. It would be difficult to imagine a better training for\r\nthe naturalist than to spend years, as Huxley did, working at this\r\nvaried assortment of living creatures. Huxley declared that the\r\ndifficulties of examining such flimsy creatures had been exaggerated.\r\n\r\n     \"At least, with a good light and a good microscope, with the ship\r\n     tolerably steady, I never failed in procuring all the information\r\n     I required. The great matter is to obtain a good successive\r\n     supply of specimens, as the more delicate oceanic species are\r\n     usually unfit for examination within a few hours after they are\r\n     taken.\"\r\n\r\nDay after day, as the _Rattlesnake_ crept from island to island,\r\nHuxley examined the animals brought up by his tow-net. He made endless\r\ndissections, and gradually accumulated a large portfolio of drawings.\r\nMuch of the time he passed at Sydney was spent in libraries and\r\nmuseums, comparing his own observations with the recorded observations\r\nof earlier workers, and receiving from the combination of his own work\r\nand the work of others new ideas for his future investigations. It was\r\nall entirely a labour of love; it lay outside the professional duties\r\nby which he made his living, and for a long time it seemed as if he\r\nwas not even to gain reputation by the discoveries he knew himself to\r\nbe making. He writes in his autobiography:\r\n\r\n     \"During the four years of our absence, I sent home communication\r\n     after communication to the 'Linnæan' Society, with the same\r\n     result as that obtained by Noah when he sent the raven out of his\r\n     ark. Tired at last of hearing nothing about them, I determined to\r\n     do or die, and in 1849 I drew up a more elaborate paper and\r\n     forwarded it to the Royal Society. This was my dove, if I had\r\n     only known it; but owing to the movements of the ship I heard\r\n     nothing of that either until my return to England in the latter\r\n     end of the year 1850, when I found that it was printed and\r\n     published, and that a huge packet of separate copies awaited me.\r\n     When I hear some of my young friends complain of want of sympathy\r\n     and encouragement, I am inclined to think that my naval life was\r\n     not the least valuable part of my education.\"\r\n\r\nThis first successful paper was a memoir _On the Anatomy and the\r\nAffinities of the Family of Medusæ_, and was sent at Captain Stanley's\r\nsuggestion to that officer's father, the Bishop of Norwich, who\r\ncommunicated it to the Royal Society. It is a curious circumstance\r\nthat Huxley, who afterwards met with so virulent opposition from\r\nbishops, owed his first public success to one of them. Professor Sir\r\nMichael Foster writes of this period in Huxley's life:\r\n\r\n     \"The career of many a successful man has shewn that obstacles\r\n     often prove the mother of endeavour, and never was this lesson\r\n     clearer than in the case of Huxley. Working amidst a host of\r\n     difficulties, in want of room, in want of light, seeking to\r\n     unravel the intricacies of minute structure with a microscope\r\n     lashed to secure steadiness, cramped within a tiny cabin, jostled\r\n     by the tumult of a crowded ship's life, with the scantiest supply\r\n     of books of reference, with no one at hand of whom he could take\r\n     counsel on the problems opening up before him, he gathered for\r\n     himself during these four years a large mass of accurate,\r\n     important, and in most cases novel, observations and illustrated\r\n     them with skilful, pertinent drawings. Even his intellectual\r\n     solitude had its good effects: it drove him to ponder over the\r\n     new facts which came before him, and all his observations were\r\n     made alive with scientific thought.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in England, he received the Royal Medal of the Royal\r\nSociety for this memoir on Medusæ, sharing this supreme distinction of\r\nscientific England with men so illustrious as Joule, the discoverer of\r\nthe relation between force and heat, Stokes, the great investigator of\r\noptical physics, and Humboldt, the traveller, all of whom received\r\nmedals in the same year. In making the presentation to Huxley, the\r\nEarl of Rosse, then President of the Royal Society, declared:\r\n\r\n     \"In those papers you have for the first time fully developed\r\n     their structure (that of the Medusæ), and laid the foundation of\r\n     a rational theory for their classification. In your second paper,\r\n     on the anatomy of Salpa and Pyrosoma, the phenomena have received\r\n     the most ingenious and elaborate elucidations, and have given\r\n     rise to a process of reasoning, the results of which can scarcely\r\n     yet be anticipated, but must bear in a very important degree upon\r\n     some of the most abstruse points of what may be called\r\n     transcendental physiology.\"\r\n\r\nMany reasons make it difficult for us to realise, now, the singular\r\nnovelty and importance of Huxley's memoir on the Medusæ. The first is\r\na reason which often prevents great discoveries in almost every\r\nsubject from receiving in after years their due respect. The years\r\nthat have passed since 1850 have seen not only the most amazing\r\nprogress in our knowledge of comparative anatomy, but almost a\r\nrevolution in the methods of studying it. Huxley's work has been\r\nincorporated in the very body of science. A large number of later\r\ninvestigators have advanced upon the lines he laid down; and just as\r\nthe superstructures of a great building conceal the foundations, so\r\nlater anatomical work, although it has only amplified and extended\r\nHuxley's discoveries, has made them seem less striking to the modern\r\nreader. The present writer, for instance, learned all that he knows of\r\nanatomy in the last ten years, and until he turned to it for the\r\npurpose of this volume he had never referred to Huxley's original\r\npaper. When he did so, he found from beginning to end nothing that was\r\nnew to him, nothing that was strange: all the ideas in the memoir had\r\npassed into the currency of knowledge and he had been taught them as\r\nfundamental facts. It was only when he turned to the text-books of\r\nanatomy and natural history current in Huxley's time that he was able\r\nto realise how the conclusions of the young ship-surgeon struck the\r\nFellows and President of the Royal Society as luminous and\r\nrevolutionary ideas.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the century, a conception of the animal kingdom\r\nprevailed which was entirely different from our modern ideas. We know\r\nnow that all animals are bound together by the bond of a common\r\ndescent, and we seek in anatomy a clue to the degrees of relationship\r\nexisting among the different animals we know. We regard the animal\r\nkingdom as a thicket of branches all springing from a common root.\r\nSome of these spring straight up from the common root unconnected with\r\ntheir fellows. Others branch repeatedly, and all the branches of the\r\nsame stem have features in common. What we see in the living world is\r\nonly the surface of the thicket, the tops of the twigs; and it is by\r\nexamination of the structure of this surface that we reconstruct in\r\nimagination the whole system of branches, and know that certain twigs,\r\nfrom their likeness, meet each other a little way down; that others\r\nare connected only very deep down, and that others, again, spring\r\nfree almost from the beginning. The fossils of beds of rock of\r\ndifferent geological ages give us incomplete views of the surface of\r\nthe thicket of life, as it was in earlier times. These views we have\r\nof the past aspects of the animal kingdom are always much more\r\nincomplete than our knowledge of the existing aspect; partly because\r\nmany animals, from the softness of their bodies, have left either no\r\nfossil remains at all, or only very imperfect casts of the external\r\nsurfaces of their bodies; and partly because the turning of any animal\r\ninto a fossil, and its subsequent discovery by a geologist, are\r\noccasional accidents; but, although the evidence is much less perfect\r\nthan we could wish, there is enough of it to convince anatomists that\r\nexisting animals are all in definite blood-relationship to each other,\r\nand to make them, in the investigation of any new animal, study its\r\nanatomy with the definite view of finding out its place in the family\r\ntree of the living world.\r\n\r\nWhen Huxley made his first discoveries, entirely different ideas\r\nprevailed. The animal kingdom was supposed to offer a series of types,\r\nof moulds, into which the Creator at the beginning of the world had\r\ncast the substance of life. These types were independent of each\r\nother, and had been so since the beginning of things. Anatomists were\r\nconcerned chiefly with systematic work, with detecting and recording\r\nthe slight differences that existed among the numbers of animals\r\ngrouped around each type. No attempt was made to see connection\r\nbetween type and type, for where these had been separately created\r\nthere was nothing to connect them except possibly some idea in the\r\nmind of the Creator. This apparently barren attitude to nature was\r\nstronger in men's minds because it had inspired the colossal\r\nachievements of Cuvier, a genius who, under whatever misconceptions he\r\nhad worked, would have added greatly to knowledge. As we have seen in\r\nthe first chapter, Huxley, through Wharton Jones, and through his own\r\nreading, had been brought under the more modern German thought of\r\nJohannes Mueller and Von Baer. He had learned to study the problems of\r\nliving nature in the spirit of a physicist making investigations into\r\ndead nature. In the anatomy of animals, as in the structure of rocks\r\nand crystals, there were to be sought out \"laws of growth\" and shaping\r\nand moulding influences which accounted for the form of the\r\nstructures. To use the technical term, he was a morphologist: one who\r\nstudied the architecture of animals not merely in a spirit of admiring\r\nwonder, but with the definite idea of finding out the guiding\r\nprinciples which had determined these shapes.\r\n\r\nNot only was the prevailing method of investigation faulty, but actual\r\nknowledge of a large part of the animal kingdom was extremely limited.\r\nIn the minds of most zoölogists the animal kingdom was divided into\r\ntwo great groups: the vertebrates and invertebrates. The vertebrate,\r\nor back-boned, animals were well known; comparatively speaking they\r\nare all built upon the type of man; and human anatomists, who indeed\r\nmade up the greater number of all anatomists, using their exact\r\nknowledge of the human body, had studied many other vertebrates with\r\nminute care, and, from man to fishes, had arranged living vertebrates\r\nvery much in the modern order. But the invertebrates were a vague and\r\nill-assorted heap of animals. It was not recognised that among them\r\nthere were many series of different grades of ascending complexity,\r\nand there was no well-known form to serve as a standard of comparison\r\nfor all the others in the fashion that the body of man served as a\r\nstandard of comparison for all vertebrates. Here and there, a few\r\nsalient types such as insects and snails had been picked out, but\r\nknowledge of them helped but little with a great many of the\r\ninvertebrates. The great Linnæus had divided the animal kingdom into\r\nfour groups of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes, but\r\nfor the invertebrates he had done no more than to pick out the insects\r\nas one group and to call everything else \"Vermes\" or worms. The\r\ninsects included all creatures possessed of an external skeleton or\r\nhard skin divided into jointed segments, and included forms so\r\ndifferent as insects, spiders, crabs, and lobsters. But Vermes\r\nincluded all the members of the animal kingdom that were neither\r\nvertebrates nor insects. Cuvier advanced a little. He got rid of the\r\ncomprehensive title Vermes--the label of the rubbish-heap of\r\nzoölogists. He divided animals into four great subkingdoms:\r\nVertebrates, Mollusca, Articulata, Radiata. These names, however, only\r\ncovered very superficial resemblances among the animals designated by\r\nthem. The word _Mollusca_ only meant that the creatures grouped\r\ntogether had soft bodies, unsupported by internal or external\r\narticulated skeletons; and this character, or, rather, absence of\r\ncharacter, was applied alike to many totally dissimilar creatures. The\r\nterm _Articulata_ included not only Linnæus's insects but a number of\r\nsoft-skinned, apparently jointed, worm-like animals such as the leech\r\nand earthworm. Lastly, the name _Radiata_ meant no more than that the\r\norgans of the creatures so designated were more or less disposed\r\naround a centre, as the sepals and petals of a flower are grouped\r\naround the central pistil; and it included animals so different as\r\nthe starfish and sea-anemones and Medusæ. The names used in the\r\nclassification were not only loosely applied but were based on the\r\nmost superficial observation, and took no account of the intimate\r\nstructures of the tissues and organs of the animals. With slight\r\nmodifications, due to individual taste or special knowledge of small\r\ngroups, later writers had followed Linnæus and Cuvier.\r\n\r\nIt was with a view of the animal kingdom not much clearer than this\r\nthat Huxley began his work on the Medusæ of the tropic seas. He began\r\nto study them no doubt simply because they were among the most\r\nabundant of the animals that could be obtained from the ship. He made\r\nendless dissections and drawings, and, above all, studied their minute\r\nanatomy with the microscope. They were all placed among Cuvier's\r\n_Radiata_, but, as Huxley said in the first line of his memoir:\r\n\r\n     \"Perhaps no class of animals has been investigated with so little\r\n     satisfactory and comprehensive result, and this not for the want\r\n     of patience and ability on the part of the observers, but rather\r\n     because they have contented themselves with stating matters of\r\n     detail concerning particular genera and species, instead of\r\n     giving broad and general views of the whole class, considered as\r\n     organised upon a given type, and inquiring into its relations\r\n     with other families.\"\r\n\r\nHe found that fully developed Medusæ consisted each of a disc with\r\ntentacles and vesicular bodies at the margins, a stomach, and canals\r\nproceeding from it, and generative organs. He traced this simple\r\ncommon structure through the complications and modifications in which\r\nit appeared in the different groups of Medusæ, in all this work\r\nbringing out the prevailing features of the anatomy in contrast to\r\nthe individual peculiarities. He shewed that microscopically all the\r\ncomplicated systems of canals and organs were composed of two\r\n\"foundation-membranes,\" two thin webs of cells, one of which formed\r\nthe outermost layer of the body, while the inner formed the lining of\r\nthe stomach and canals in the thinner parts of the body, such as the\r\nedges of the umbrella-like disc, and towards the ends of the\r\ntentacles. These thin webs formed practically all the body. In the\r\nthicker parts there was interposed between them an almost\r\nstructureless layer of jelly, placed like padding between the lining\r\nand the cloth of a coat. He shewed that blood-vessels and blood were\r\nabsent, in which he has been confirmed by all other observers. He\r\ndeclared more doubtfully against the existence of a special nervous\r\nsystem, and it was not until long after, when the methods of\r\nmicroscopic investigation were much more perfect, that the delicate\r\nnerve-cells and nerve-fibres, which we now know to exist, were\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shewn the peculiar organisation of the group he turned to\r\nseek out its allies among other families. The Medusæ consisted\r\nessentially of two membranes inclosing a variously shaped cavity\r\ninasmuch as all its organs were so composed. The generative organs\r\nwere external, being variously developed processes of the two\r\nmembranes. The peculiar organs called thread-cells--poisoned darts by\r\nthe discharge of which prey could be paralysed--were universally\r\npresent. What other families presented these peculiarities?\r\n\r\nThere are to be found abundantly in sea-water, and less frequently in\r\nfresh water, innumerable forms of animal life called Zoöphytes or\r\nanimal plants because they occur as encrusting masses like lichens, or\r\nbranched forests like moss, on the surface of stones and shells. A\r\ncommon habit gave this set of creatures their common name; but,\r\nalthough they were grouped together, there was no greater affinity\r\namong them than there is racial affinity among people who clothe\r\nthemselves for an evening party in the same conventional dress. Huxley\r\nexamined a large number of these, and picked out from them two great\r\nfamilies of polyps, the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps, which each\r\nconsist of colonies of creatures very much like the little fresh-water\r\nhydra. He shewed that the tubular body of these and the ring of\r\ntentacles surrounding the mouth were composed of the same two\r\nfoundation-membranes of which all the organs of Medusæ are composed.\r\nHe found in them the poisoned arrows or thread-cells of the Medusæ,\r\nand the same external position of the reproductive organs. And,\r\nlastly, he separated from all other creatures, and associated with his\r\nnew group, some of the strangest and most beautiful animals of the\r\ntropic seas, known to science as the Physophoridæ and the Diphyidæ.\r\nThe best-known of these is the \"Portuguese man-of-war,\" the body of\r\nwhich consists of a large pear-shaped vesicle which floats on the\r\nwater like a bladder. From the lower part of this depend into the\r\nwater large and small nutritive branches, each ending in a mouth\r\nsurrounded by a circle of waving tentacles armed with batteries of\r\nthread-cells, while another set of hanging protrusions bear the\r\ngrape-like reproductive organs. On the upper surface of the bladder is\r\nfixed a purple sail of the most brilliant colour, by which the\r\nfloating creature is blown through the water. When the weather is\r\nrough, the bladder empties, and the creature sinks down into the quiet\r\nwater below the waves, to rise again when the storm is over. This,\r\nand its equally wonderful allies, Huxley showed to be a complicated\r\ncolony of hydra-like creatures, each part being composed of two\r\nmembranes, and therefore essentially similar to Medusæ. Thus, by a\r\ngreat piece of constructive work, an assemblage of animals was\r\ngathered into a new group and shewn to be organised upon one simple\r\nand uniform plan, and, even in the most complex and aberrant forms,\r\nreducible to the same type. The group, and Huxley's conception of its\r\nstructure, are now absolutely accepted by anatomists, and have made\r\none of the corner-stones of our modern idea of the arrangement of the\r\nanimal kingdom. With the exception of sponges, concerning the exact\r\nrelations of which there is still dispute, and of a few sets of\r\nparasitic and possibly degenerate creatures, all animals, the bodies\r\nof which are multicellular, from the simple fresh-water hydra up to\r\nman, are divided into two great groups. The structure of the simpler\r\nof these groups is exactly what Huxley found to be of importance in\r\nthe Medusæ. The body wall, from which all the organs protrude,\r\nconsists merely of a web of cells arranged in two sheets or membranes,\r\nand the single cavity consists of a central stomach, surrounded by\r\nthese membranes, the cavity remaining simple or giving rise to a\r\nnumber of branching canals. The members of this great division of the\r\nanimal kingdom are the creatures which Huxley selected and placed\r\ntogether, with the addition of the sea-anemones and the medusa-like\r\nCtenophora, which, indeed, he mentioned in his memoir as being related\r\nto the others, but reserved fuller consideration for a future\r\noccasion. This group is now called the Coelenterata, the name\r\nimplying that the creatures are simply hollow stomachs, and it is\r\ncontrasted in the strongest way with the group Coelomata, in which\r\nare placed all the higher animals, from the simplest worm up to man;\r\nanimals in which, in addition to the two foundation-membranes of the\r\nCoelenterata, there is a third foundation-membrane, and in which, in\r\naddition to the simple stomach cavity with its offshoots, there is a\r\ntrue body-cavity or coelome, and usually a set of spaces and\r\nchannels containing a blood-fluid. The older method of naming groups\r\nof animals after some obvious superficial character lingered on for\r\nsome years in text-books and treatises, but in this memoir the young\r\nship-surgeon had replaced it by the modern scientific method of\r\ngrouping animals together only because of real identity of structure.\r\n\r\nThere is yet left to be noticed perhaps the most wonderful of all the\r\nideas in this first memoir by Huxley. In the course of describing the\r\ntwo foundation membranes of the Medusæ he remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"It is curious to remark, that throughout, the outer and inner\r\n     membranes appear to bear the same physiological relation to one\r\n     another as do the serous and mucous layers of the germ: the outer\r\n     becoming developed into the muscular system, and giving rise to\r\n     the organs of offence and defence: the inner on the other hand\r\n     appearing to be more closely subservient to the purposes of\r\n     nutrition and generation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the whole range of science it would be difficult to select an\r\nutterance more prophetic of future knowledge than these few words.\r\nHuxley had been reading the investigations of Von Baer into the early\r\ndevelopment of back-boned animals. He had learned from them the great\r\ngeneralisation, that the younger stages of these animals resemble one\r\nanother more closely than the adult stages, and that in an early stage\r\nin the development of all these animals the beginning of the embryo\r\nconsists of two layers of cells, in fact of two foundation-membranes,\r\none forming specially the wall of the future digestive canal, the\r\nother forming the most external portion of the future animal. In these\r\ndays nothing could have seemed a remoter or more unlikely comparison\r\nthan one instituted between Medusæ and the embryonic stages of\r\nback-boned animals. But Huxley made it, not allowing the evidence\r\nbrought before his reason to be swamped by preconceived ideas. At the\r\ntime he did no more than to make the comparison. It was much later\r\nthat the full importance of it became known, when more extended work\r\non the embryology of vertebrates and of the different groups of the\r\ninvertebrates had made it plain that the two foundation-membranes of\r\nHuxley occur in all animals from the Medusæ up to man. In the group of\r\nCoelenterata the organisation remains throughout life as nothing\r\nmore than a folding in and folding out of these membranes. The early\r\nstages of all the higher animals similarly consist of complications of\r\nthe two membranes; but later on there is added to them a third\r\nmembrane. Thus the group that Huxley gathered together comprises those\r\nanimals that as adults remain in a condition of development which is\r\npassed through in the embryonic life of all higher animals. The\r\nimmense importance of this conclusion becomes plain, and the\r\nconclusion itself seems obvious, when seen in the light of the\r\ndoctrine of descent. The group of Coelenterata represents a\r\nsurviving, older condition in the evolution of animals. Huxley\r\nhimself, when on the _Rattlesnake_, regarded evolution only as a vague\r\nmetaphysical dream, and he made the comparison which has been\r\ndescribed without any afterthought of what it implied. In this we have\r\nthe earliest authentic instance of the peculiar integrity of mind\r\nwhich was so characteristic of him in his dealings with philosophy and\r\ntradition. He never allowed any weight of authority or any apparent\r\ndisturbance of existing ideas to alter the conclusions to which his\r\nreason led him. This intellectual courage made him fitted to be the\r\nleader in the battle for evolution and against traditional thought,\r\nand we shall find again and again in consideration of his work that it\r\nwas the keynote of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEARLY DAYS IN LONDON\r\n\r\n     Scientific Work as Unattached Ship-Surgeon--Introduction to\r\n     London Scientific Society--Translating, Reviewing, and\r\n     Lecturing--Ascidians--Molluscs and the Archetype--Criticism of\r\n     Pre-Darwinian Evolution--Appointment to Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Rattlesnake_ was paid off at Chatham on November 9, 1850. In the\r\nnatural course of events Huxley would have been appointed before long\r\nto active service upon another ship. But he had no intention of\r\nrelapsing into the position of a mere navy doctor; he had accumulated\r\nsufficient scientific material to keep him employed on scientific\r\ninvestigation for years, and so he applied to the Admiralty to \"be\r\nborne on the books\" of H.M.S. _Fisgard_ at Woolwich,--that is to say,\r\nto be appointed assistant-surgeon to the ship \"for particular\r\nservice,\" so that he should not be compelled to live on board, but\r\nmight remain in town, and, with free access to libraries and museums,\r\nwork up the observations he had made on the _Rattlesnake_ into serious\r\nand substantial contributions to science. His request was granted,\r\nlargely by the aid of his old chief, Sir W. Burnett, who continued to\r\ntake the most useful interest in the young man he had originally\r\nnominated to the service. In a letter to him Huxley described the\r\ninvestigations which he desired to continue as being chiefly those on\r\n\"the anatomy of certain Gasteropod and Pteropod Mollusca, of Firola\r\nand Atlantis, of Salpa and Pyrosoma, of two new Ascidians, namely,\r\nAppendicularia and Doliolum, of Sagitta and certain Annelids, of the\r\nauditory and circulatory organs of certain transparent Crustacea, and\r\nof the Medusæ and Polyps.\" His request was granted, and for the next\r\nthree years Huxley lived in London with his brother, on the exiguous\r\nincome of an assistant-surgeon, and devoted himself to research. He\r\nbecame almost at once of the first rank among English anatomists. The\r\nresult of the paper on Medusæ in the _Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety_ was that he was elected a Fellow of the Society on June 5,\r\n1851, and a year later received a Royal Medal of the Society. He made\r\nmany warm friendships both among the older and the younger generations\r\nof scientific men. In his obituary notice of Huxley, Sir Michael\r\nFoster wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"By Edward Forbes, in whose nature there was much that was akin\r\n     to his own, and with whom he had some acquaintance before his\r\n     voyage, he was at once greeted as a comrade, and with Joseph\r\n     Dalton Hooker, to whom he was drawn at the very first by their\r\n     common experience as navy surgeons, he began an attachment which,\r\n     strengthened by like biological aspirations, grew closer as their\r\n     lives went on. In the first year after his return, in the autumn\r\n     of 1851, he made the acquaintance of John Tyndall at the meeting\r\n     of the British Association at Ipswich, and the three, Hooker,\r\n     Huxley, and Tyndall, finding how much in common were all their\r\n     scientific views and desires, formed then and there a triple\r\n     scientific alliance.\"\r\n\r\nRepeated efforts were made by these three, and by more influential\r\nfriends, to induce the Admiralty to contribute to the expense of\r\npublishing Huxley's scientific results, as they had given a pledge to\r\nencourage officers who had done scientific work. These efforts lasted\r\nunavailingly for nearly three years, and then, as Huxley says: \"The\r\nAdmiralty, getting tired, I suppose, cut short the discussion by\r\nordering me to join a ship, which thing I declined to do, and, as\r\nRastignac, in the _Père Goriot_, says to Paris, I said to London, _à\r\nnous deux_.\" This light phrase conceals a courageous and momentous\r\ndecision. He was absolutely without private resources, and having\r\nabandoned his professional work he had no salary of any kind. For a\r\nyear or so he supported himself by writing reviews and popular\r\nscientific articles, striving all the time not only to gain his bread\r\nbut to continue his scientific work and make it known to the public.\r\nHe desired to get a professorship of physiology or of comparative\r\nanatomy, and as vacancies occurred he applied, but unsuccessfully. At\r\nthe same time, he tells us, he and his friend, John Tyndall, were\r\n\r\n     \"candidates, he for the Chair of Physics, and I for that of\r\n     Natural History in the University of Toronto, which, fortunately,\r\n     as it turned out, would not look at either of us. I say\r\n     fortunately, not from any lack of respect for the University of\r\n     Toronto; but because I soon made up my mind that London was the\r\n     place for me, and hence I have steadily declined the inducements\r\n     to leave it which have at various times been offered.\"\r\n\r\nIn these early years in London Huxley's work was most varied. A large\r\nnumber of anonymous articles by him appeared in the _Literary\r\nGazette_, and in other periodicals. He assisted to remove the insular\r\nnarrowness from English scientific work by translating many foreign\r\nmemoirs. With the collaboration of Mr. Henfrey, he edited a series of\r\nscientific memoirs, all of which were translated from foreign\r\nlanguages, and many by his own pen. With the assistance of Mr. George\r\nBusk he made a translation of Kölliker's _Histology_, a great treatise\r\non microscopic anatomy which played a large part in the development of\r\nthe modern English schools of anatomy and physiology. He made some\r\nvaluable contributions to Todd and Bowman's _Cyclopædia of Anatomy_,\r\nan elaborate publication now nearly forgotten and practically\r\nsuperseded, but which was the standard anatomical work of the middle\r\nof this century. He was unable to progress rapidly with his work upon\r\noceanic Medusæ, as he was uncertain how to have it published; the\r\nAdmiralty refused to assist, and it was too lengthy for publication in\r\nthe volumes of the learned Societies. As a matter of fact, he did not\r\npublish it until 1858, when it appeared as a separate memoir. To the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science_ and to the _Transactions\r\nof the Royal and Linnæan Societies_ he contributed a large number of\r\nmemoirs dealing with the microscopic anatomy and relationships of\r\ninvertebrates, and, lastly, he gave a series of addresses at the Royal\r\nInstitution, which had been founded as a means by which leading men of\r\nscience might give accounts of their work to London society. Abstracts\r\nof these lectures are published in the early volumes of the\r\n_Proceedings of the Royal Institution_ and are interesting as shewing\r\nthe kinds of zoölogical subjects which were attracting the attention\r\nof Huxley and which he considered of sufficient interest and\r\nimportance to bring to the notice of the general public. The first of\r\nthese lectures, and probably the first given in public by Huxley,\r\noccurred on April 30, 1852, and was entitled \"Animal Individuality.\"\r\nThe problem as to what is meant by an individual had been raised in\r\nhis mind by consideration of many of the forms of marine life,\r\nnotably compound structures like the Portuguese man-of-war, and\r\ncreatures like the salps, which form floating chains often many yards\r\nin length. He explained that the word _individual_ covers at least\r\nthree quite different kinds of conceptions. There is, first, what he\r\ndescribed as arbitrary individuality, an individuality which is given\r\nby the mind of the observer and does not actually exist in the thing\r\nconsidered. Thus a landscape is in a sense an individual thing, but\r\nonly so far as it is a particular part of the surface of the earth,\r\nisolated for the time in the mind of the person looking at it. If the\r\nobserver shift his position, the range of the landscape alters and\r\nbecomes something else. Next there are material, or practically\r\naccidental individual things, such as crystals or pieces of stone;\r\nand, lastly, there are living individuals which, as he pointed out,\r\nwere cycles. All living things are born into the world, grow up, and\r\ndie, and it was to the cycle of life, from the egg to the adult which\r\nproduces eggs, that he gave the name individual. In a simple animal\r\nlike Hydra there is no difficulty in accepting this plain definition\r\nof individuality; but Huxley went on to compare with Hydra a compound\r\ncreature like the Portuguese man-of-war, which really is composed of a\r\ncolony of Hydra-like creatures, the different members of the colony\r\nbeing more or less altered to serve different functions. All these\r\nhave come from the branching of a single simple creature produced from\r\nan egg, and to the whole colony Huxley gave the name of zoölogical\r\nindividual. The salps give a still wider interpretation to this view\r\nof individuality. The original salp produced from the egg gives rise\r\nto many salps, which may either remain attached in a chain, or,\r\nbreaking away from one another, may live separately. Huxley extended\r\nthe use of the word _individual_ so as to include as a single\r\nzoölogical individual the whole set of creatures cohering in chains or\r\nbreaking apart, which had been produced by budding from the product of\r\na single egg-cell. This subtle analysis of ideas delighted and\r\ninterested his contemporaries, and the train of logical examination of\r\nwhat is meant by individuality has persisted to the present time. Like\r\nall other zoölogical ideas, this has been considerably altered by the\r\nconception of evolution. Zoölogists no longer attempt to stretch\r\nlogical conceptions until they fit enormous and different parts of the\r\nliving world. They recognise that the living world, because it is\r\nalive, is constantly changing, and that living things pass through\r\ndifferent stages or kinds of individuality in the course of their\r\nlives. A single egg-cell is one kind, perhaps the simplest kind, of\r\nzoölogical individual; when it has grown up into a simple polyp it has\r\npassed into a second grade of individuality; when, by budding, the\r\npolyp has become branched, a third grade is reached, and when the\r\nbranches have become different, in obedience to the different purposes\r\nwhich they are to serve in the whole compound creature, a still\r\nfurther grade is reached. Huxley's attempt to find a meaning for\r\nindividuality that would apply equally to a single simple creature, to\r\na compound creature, and to the large number of separate creatures,\r\nall developed by budding from one creature, is a striking instance of\r\nhis singular capacity for bringing apparently dissimilar facts into\r\nharmony, by finding out the common underlying principle, and, although\r\nwe no longer accept this particular conclusion, we cannot fail to\r\nnotice in it the peculiar powers of his mind.\r\n\r\nA second and even more interesting Royal Institution lecture dealt\r\nwith the \"Identity of Structure in Animals and Plants.\" At the present\r\ntime every educated person knows that the life of animals and plants\r\nalike depends on the fact that their bodies are composed of a living\r\nmaterial called protoplasm, a material which is identical in every\r\nimportant respect in both kingdoms of the living world. In the early\r\nfifties, scientific opinion was by no means clear on this matter, and\r\ncertainly public opinion was most vague. Huxley discussed what was\r\nmeant by organisation, and shewed that in every essential respect\r\nplants and animals alike were organised beings. Then he went on to\r\nexplain the cellular theory of Schwann, which was then a novelty to a\r\ngeneral audience. Schwann, in studying the microscopic structure of\r\nplants, noticed that their bodies were made up of little cases with\r\nfirm walls; these he called _cells_, and declared that the whole body\r\nof the plant was composed of cells. As the walls of these cells were\r\nthe most obvious and visible feature, it was supposed that they were\r\nthe most essential part of the structure, and there was some\r\ndifficulty in applying the cellular theory to the bodies of animals,\r\nas in most cases there are no easily visible cell-walls in animal\r\ntissues. As the result of his own observation, and from his reading of\r\nthe work of others, Huxley laid down in the clearest way what is now\r\naccepted by everyone--that the presence of walls is of minor\r\nimportance, and that it is the slimy contents of the cells, what is\r\ncalled \"protoplasm,\" that is the important element. He declared that\r\nthe protoplasm of animals was identical with the protoplasm of plants,\r\nand that plants were \"animals confined in wooden cases.\" He agreed\r\nwith Schwann that the cell, using the term to imply the contents\r\nrather than the wall, was of fundamental importance, and was the unit\r\nof structure of the whole world of life. On the other hand, he\r\ndeclared that it could not be looked at as the unit of function: he\r\ndenied that the powers and properties of a living body were simply the\r\nsum of the powers and properties of the single cells. In this opinion\r\nhe was not followed by physiologists until quite recently. For many\r\nyears physiologists held that cells were units of function just as\r\nmuch as they are units of structure; but in the last ten years there\r\nhas been a strong return to the opinion of Huxley.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 two very important memoirs were published in the _Transactions\r\nof the Royal Society_, which contained the results of Huxley's\r\nobservations of the interesting animals known as \"tunicates.\" The\r\nfirst of these papers begins as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The Salpæ, those strange gelatinous animals, through masses of\r\n     which the voyager in the great ocean sometimes sails day after\r\n     day, have been the subject of a great controversy since the time\r\n     of the publication of the celebrated work of Chamisso, _De\r\n     Animalibus Quibusdam e Classe Vermium Linnæana_. In this work\r\n     there were set forth, for the first time, the singular phenomena\r\n     presented by the reproductive processes of these\r\n     animals,--phenomena so strange, and so utterly unlike anything\r\n     then known to occur in the whole province of zoölogy, that\r\n     Chamisso's admirably clear and truthful account was received with\r\n     almost as much distrust as if he had announced the existence of a\r\n     veritable Peter Schlemihl.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Chamisso, salps appeared in two forms: solitary forms,\r\nand forms in which a number of salps are united into a long chain.\r\nEach salp of the aggregate form contains within it an embryo receiving\r\nnutrition from the mother by a connection similar to the placenta by\r\nwhich the embryo of a mammal receives nourishment from the blood of\r\nthe mother. These embryos grow up into the solitary form, and the\r\nsolitary form gives rise to a long chain of the aggregate form which\r\ndevelopes in the interior of the body. Chamisso compared this progress\r\nto the development of insects. \"Supposing,\" he said, \"caterpillars did\r\nnot bodily change into butterflies, but by a process of sexual\r\nbreeding produced young which grew into the ordinary adults, and that\r\nthese adults, as indeed they do, gave rise to caterpillars by sexual\r\nreproduction, then there would be a true alternation of generations.\"\r\nThe first generation would give rise to a second generation totally\r\nunlike itself, and this second generation would reproduce, not its\r\nkind, but the first generation; such an alternation of generations he\r\nstated to occur among the salps. Huxley had an excellent opportunity\r\nto study this question at Cape York in November, 1849. \"For a time the\r\nsea was absolutely crowded with Salpæ, in all stages of growth, and of\r\nsize very convenient for examination.\" He was able to verify the\r\ngeneral truth of Chamisso's statement. The aggregate form of Salpa\r\nalways gives rise to the solitary salps, and the solitary salps always\r\ngive rise to chains of the aggregate salps. But the process of\r\nreproduction he shewed to be quite different in the two cases. The\r\nsolitary salp produces in its interior a little stolon or diverticulum\r\nwhich contains an outgrowth from the circulatory system, and this\r\nstolon gradually becomes pinched off into the members of the chain of\r\nthe aggregate form. The salps of the aggregate form are therefore\r\nmerely buds from the solitary form, and are not produced in the\r\nordinary way, by sexual generation. On the other hand, each salp of\r\nthe chain has within it a true egg-cell. This is fertilised by a male\r\ncell, and within the body of the parent, nourished by the blood of the\r\nparent, grows up into the solitary form. There is then an alternation\r\nof generations, but there are not two sexual generations. The sexual\r\ngeneration of chain salps gives rise to forms which reproduce by buds.\r\nFrom this conclusion, with which all later observers have agreed,\r\nHuxley went on to his theory of individuality. Different names had\r\nbeen given to the two forms, but Huxley declared that neither form was\r\na true zoölogical individual; they were only parts of individuals or\r\norgans, and the true individual was the complete cycle involving both\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIn addition to determining the interesting method of reproduction,\r\nHuxley made an elaborate investigation of the structure of Salpa. On\r\none occasion only the _Rattlesnake_ came across a quantity of an\r\nallied Ascidian, Pyrosoma, which had received its name from its\r\nphosphorescence.\r\n\r\n     \"The sky was clear but moonless, and the sea calm; and a more\r\n     beautiful sight can hardly be imagined than that presented from\r\n     the deck of the ship as she drifted, hour after hour, through\r\n     this shoal of miniature pillars of fire gleaming out of the dark\r\n     sea, with an ever-waning, ever brightening, soft bluish light, as\r\n     far as the eye could reach on every side. The Pyrosomata floated\r\n     deep, and it was only with difficulty that some were procured for\r\n     examination and placed in a bucketful of sea-water. The\r\n     phosphorescence was intermittent, periods of darkness alternating\r\n     with periods of brilliancy. The light commenced in one spot,\r\n     apparently on the surface of one of the zoöids, and gradually\r\n     spread from this as a centre in all directions; then the whole\r\n     was lighted up: it remained brilliant for a few seconds, and then\r\n     gradually faded and died away, until the whole mass was dark\r\n     again. Friction at any point induces the light at that point, and\r\n     from thence the phosphorescence spreads over the whole, while the\r\n     creature is quite freshly taken; afterwards, the illumination\r\n     arising from friction is only local.\"\r\n\r\nDealing with these creatures in the broad anatomical spirit with which\r\nhe had studied the Medusæ, Huxley shewed the typical structure\r\nmanifested in the different forms, and that was common to them and the\r\nAscidians or sea-squirts of the seashore. In a second paper on\r\n\"Appendicularia and Doliolum\" he made further contributions to our\r\nknowledge of these interesting creatures. Appendicularia is a curious\r\nlittle Ascidian, differing from all the others in its possession of a\r\ntail. Earlier observers had obtained it on various parts of the ocean\r\nsurface, but had failed entirely to detect its relationship to the\r\nordinary Ascidians. Chamisso got it near Behring's Straits and thought\r\nthat it was more nearly allied to \"Venus's Girdle,\" a Coelenterate.\r\nMertens, another distinguished zoölogist, had declared that \"the\r\nrelation of this animal with the Pteropods (a peculiar group of\r\nmolluscs) is unmistakable\"; while Müller, a prince among German\r\nanatomists, confessed that \"he did not know in what division of the\r\nanimal kingdom to place this creature.\" Huxley shewed that it\r\npossessed all the characteristic features of the Ascidians, the same\r\narrangement of organs, the same kind of nervous system, a respiratory\r\nchamber formed from the fore part of the alimentary canal, and a\r\npeculiar organ running along the pharynx which Huxley called the\r\nendostyle and which is one of the most striking peculiarities of the\r\nwhole group. The real nature of the tail was Huxley's most striking\r\ndiscovery. He pointed out that ordinary Ascidians begin life as tiny\r\ntadpole-like creatures which swim freely by the aid of a long caudal\r\nappendage; and that while these better-known Ascidians lose their\r\ntails when they settle down into adult life, the Appendiculariæ are\r\nAscidians which retain this larval structure throughout life. Von Baer\r\nhad shown that in the great natural groups of higher animals some\r\nforms occur which typify, in their adult condition, the larval state\r\nof the higher forms of the group. Thus, among the amphibia, frogs have\r\ntails in the larval or tadpole condition; but newts throughout life\r\nremain in the larval or tailed condition. Appendicularia he considered\r\nto be the lowest form of the Ascidians, and to typify in its adult\r\ncondition the larval stages of the higher Ascidians.\r\n\r\nBy this remarkable investigation of the structure of the group of\r\nAscidians, and display of the various grades of organisation, Huxley\r\npaved the way for one of the great modern advances in knowledge. When,\r\nlater on, the idea of evolution was accepted, and zoölogists began\r\nhunting out the pedigree of the back-boned animals, it was discovered\r\nthat Ascidians were modern representatives of an important stage in\r\nthe ancestry of vertebrate animals, and, therefore, of man himself.\r\nThere are few more interesting chapters in genealogical zoölogy than\r\nthose which reveal the relationship between Amphioxus and fish on the\r\none hand, and Ascidians on the other; for fish are vertebrates, and\r\nAscidians, on the old view, are lowly invertebrates. The details of\r\nthese relationships have been made known to us by the brilliant\r\ninvestigations of several Germans, by Kowalevsky, a Russian, by the\r\nEnglishmen Ray Lankester and Willey, and by several Americans and\r\nFrenchmen. But behind the work of all these lies the pioneer work of\r\nHuxley, who first gathered the group of Ascidians together, and in a\r\nseries of masterly investigations described its typical structure.\r\n\r\nHuxley's next great piece of work was embodied in a memoir published\r\nin the _Transactions of the Royal Society_ in 1853, and which remains\r\nto the present day a model of luminous description and far-reaching\r\nideas. It was a treatise on the structure of the great group of\r\nmolluscs, and displays in a striking fashion his method of handling\r\nanatomical facts, and deducing from them the great underlying\r\nprinciples of construction. The shell-fish with which he dealt\r\nspecially were those distinguished as cephalous, because, unlike\r\ncreatures such as the oyster and mussel, they had something readily\r\ncomparable with the head of vertebrates. He began by pointing out what\r\nproblems he hoped to solve. The anatomy of many of the cephalous\r\nmolluscs was known, but the relation of structures present in one to\r\nstructures present in another group had not been settled.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not settled whether the back of a cuttle-fish answers to\r\n     the dorsal or ventral surface of a gasteropod. It is not decided\r\n     whether the arms and funnels of the one have or have not their\r\n     homologues in the other. The dorsal integument of a Doris and the\r\n     cloak of a whelk are both called 'mantle,' without any evidence\r\n     to show that they are really homologous. Nor do very much more\r\n     definite notions seem to have prevailed with regard to the\r\n     archetypal molluscous form, and the mode in which (if such an\r\n     archetype exist) it becomes modified in the different secondary\r\n     types.\"\r\n\r\nHe had taken from the surface of the sea a number of transparent\r\nshell-fish, and had been able to study the structure and arrangement\r\nof their organs \"by simple inspection, without so much as disturbing a\r\nsingle beat of their hearts.\" From knowledge gained in this fashion,\r\nand from ordinary dissection of a number of common snails,\r\ncephalopods, and pteropods, he was able to describe in a very complete\r\nway the anatomical structure of cephalous molluscs. The next natural\r\nstep, he stated, would have been to describe the embryonic development\r\nof the organs of these different creatures in order that a true\r\nknowledge might be gained of what were the homologous or really\r\ncorresponding parts in each. Having had no opportunity to make such\r\nembryological studies for himself, he fell back on numerous accounts\r\nof development by Kölliker, Van Beneden, Gegenbauer, and others, and\r\nso gradually arrived at a conception of what he called the \"archetype\"\r\nof the cephalous molluscs. As the word _archetype_ was borrowed from\r\nold metaphysical ideas dating back to the time of Plato, he took care\r\nto state that what he meant by it was no more than a form embodying\r\nall that could be affirmed equally respecting every single kind of\r\ncephalous mollusc, and by no means an \"idea\" upon which it could be\r\nsupposed that animal forms had been modelled. He described this\r\narchetype, and showed the condition of the different systems of organs\r\nwhich it could be supposed to possess, and how these organs were\r\nmodified in the different existing groups. This archetypal mollusc of\r\nHuxley's was a creature with a bilaterally symmetrical head and body.\r\nOn the ventral side of the body it possessed a peculiar locomotor\r\nappendage, the so-called foot, and the dorsal surface of the body\r\nsecreted a shell. Its nervous system consisted of three pairs of\r\nganglia or brains, one pair in the head, one in the foot, and a third\r\nin the viscera. He shewed how the widely different groups of cephalous\r\nmolluscs could be conceived as modifications of this structure, and\r\nextended the conception so as to cover all other molluscs.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the anatomical value of this paper, and although all\r\ntechnical details have been omitted here, it is necessary to say that\r\nmerely as a series of intricate anatomical descriptions and\r\ncomparisons, this memoir was one of the most valuable of any that\r\nHuxley wrote. The working out of the theory of the archetype is\r\npeculiarly interesting to compare with modern conceptions. To those of\r\nus who began biological work after the idea of evolution had been\r\nimpressed upon anatomical work, it is very difficult to follow\r\nHuxley's papers without reading into them evolutionary ideas. In the\r\narticle upon Mollusca, written for the ninth edition of the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_, by Professor Ray Lankester, the same device\r\nof an archetypal or, as Lankester calls it, a schematic mollusc, is\r\nemployed in order to explain the relations of the different structures\r\nfound in different groups of molluscs to one another. Lankester's\r\nschematic mollusc differs from Huxley's archetypal mollusc only as a\r\nfinished modern piece of mechanism, the final result of years of\r\nexperiment, differs from the original invention. The method of\r\ncomparing the schematic mollusc with the different divergent forms in\r\ndifferent groups is identical, and yet, while the ideas of Darwin are\r\naccepted in every line of Lankester's work, Huxley was writing six\r\nyears before the publication of _The Origin of Species_. There was\r\ngrowing up in Huxley's mind, partly from his own attempts to arrange\r\nthe anatomical facts he discovered in an intelligible series, the idea\r\nthat within a group the divergencies of structure to be found had come\r\nabout by the modification of an original type. Not only did he\r\nconceive of such an evolution as the only possible explanation of the\r\nfacts, but he definitely used the word _evolution_ to convey his\r\nideas. On the other hand, he was firmly convinced that such evolution\r\nwas confined within the great groups. For each group there was a\r\ntypical structure, and modifications by defect or excess of the parts\r\nof the definite archetype gave rise to the different members of the\r\ngroup. Moreover, he confined this evolution in the strictest possible\r\nway to each group; he did not believe that what was called\r\nanamorphosis--the transition of a lower type into a higher type--ever\r\noccurred. To use his own words:\r\n\r\n     \"If, however, all Cephalous Mollusca, _i.e._, all Cephalopoda,\r\n     Gasteropoda, and Lamellibranchiata, be only modifications by\r\n     excess or defect of the parts of a definite archetype, then, I\r\n     think, it follows as a necessary consequence, that no\r\n     anamorphosis takes place in this group. There is no progression\r\n     from a lower to a higher type, but merely a more or less complete\r\n     evolution of one type. It may indeed be a matter of very grave\r\n     consideration whether true anamorphosis ever occurs in the whole\r\n     animal kingdom. If it do, then the doctrine that every natural\r\n     group is organised after a definite archetype, a doctrine which\r\n     seems to me as important for zoölogy as the theory of definite\r\n     proportions for chemistry, must be given up.\"\r\n\r\nIt is of great historical interest to notice how closely actual\r\nconsideration of the facts of the animal kingdom took zoölogists to an\r\nidea of evolution, and yet how far they were from it as we hold it\r\nnow. It is fashionable at the present time to attempt to depreciate\r\nthe immense change introduced by Darwin into zoölogical speculation,\r\nand the method employed is largely partial quotation, or reference to\r\nthe kind of ideas found in papers such as this memoir by Huxley. The\r\ncomparison between the types of the great groups and the combining\r\nproportions of the chemical elements shows clearly that Huxley\r\nregarded the structural plans of the great groups as properties\r\nnecessary and inherent in these groups, just as the property of a\r\nchemical element to combine with another chemical substance only in a\r\nfixed proportion is necessary and inherent in the existing conception\r\nof it. There was no glimmer of the idea that these types were not\r\ninherent, but merely historical results of a long and slow series of\r\nchanges produced by the interaction of the varied conditions of life\r\nand the intrinsic qualities of living material.\r\n\r\nIn two lectures delivered at the Royal Institution in 1854 and 1855,\r\nthe one on \"The Common Plan of Animal Forms,\" the other on \"The\r\nZoölogical Arguments Adduced in Favour of the Progressive Development\r\nof Animal Life in Time,\" show, so far as the published abstracts go,\r\nthe same condition of mind. The idea of progressive development of all\r\nlife from common forms was not unknown to Huxley and his\r\ncontemporaries, but was rejected by them. In the first of these two\r\nlectures he took four great groups of animals, the Vertebrates, the\r\nArticulata, the Mollusca, and the Radiata, and explained what was the\r\narchetype of each. He shewed the distinctiveness of each plan of\r\nstructure, and then discussed the relations of the ideas suggested by\r\nVon Baer to these archetypes. He stated explicitly that while the\r\nadult forms were quite unlike one another, there were traces of a\r\ncommon plan to be derived from a study of their embryonic development.\r\nSuch a trace of a common plan he had himself suggested when he\r\ncompared the foundation-membranes of the Medusæ with the first\r\nfoundation-membranes of vertebrate embryos. This was going a long way\r\ntowards modern ideas; but he stopped short, and gave no hint that he\r\nbelieved in the possibility of the development of one plan from a\r\nlower or simpler plan. The second lecture dealt with the kind of ideas\r\nwhich were crystallised in the popular but striking work of Chambers,\r\nentitled _Vestiges of Creation_. Chambers attacked the theological\r\nview that all animals and plants had been created at the beginning of\r\nthe world, and maintained that geological evidence showed the\r\noccurrence of a progressive development of animal life. Huxley, like\r\nall zoölogists and geologists who knew anything of the occurrence of\r\nfossils in the rocks of past ages, agreed with the general truth of\r\nthe conception that a progressive development had occurred which\r\nshowed that the species now existing were represented in the oldest\r\nrocks by species now extinct. But the examples he brought forward were\r\nall limited to evolution within the great groups, and did not affect\r\nhis idea that archetypes were fixed and did not pass into each other.\r\nMoreover, he summed up strongly against the suggestion that there was\r\nany parallel between the succession of life in the past and the forms\r\nassumed by modern animals in their embryological development. So far\r\nas the present writer is able to judge from study of the literature of\r\nthis period, the possibility of evolution was present in an active\r\nform in the minds of Huxley and of his contemporaries, and in an\r\nextraordinary way they brought together evidence which afterwards\r\nbecame of firstrate importance; but the idea in its modern sense was\r\nrejected by them.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Huxley's uncomfortable period of probation came to an end.\r\nEdward Forbes, who held the posts of Palæontologist to the Geological\r\nSurvey, and Lecturer on General Natural History at the Metropolitan\r\nSchool of Science Applied to Mining and the Arts, vacated these on his\r\nappointment to the Chair of Natural History in the University of\r\nEdinburgh, and Sir H. De La Beche, the then Director-General of the\r\nGeological Survey, offered both the posts to Huxley--who in June and\r\nJuly of that year had given lectures at the school in place of Forbes.\r\nHuxley says himself:\r\n\r\n     \"I refused the former point-blank, and accepted the latter only\r\n     provisionally, telling Sir Henry that I did not care for fossils,\r\n     and that I should give up natural history as soon as I could get\r\n     a physiological post. But I held the office for thirty-one years,\r\n     and a large part of my work has been palæontological.\"\r\n\r\nThe salary of the post of Lecturer on Natural History was scanty, but\r\nDe La Beche, who evidently recognised Huxley's genius, and was anxious\r\nto have him attached even against his will to palæontological work,\r\ncreated a place for him as Naturalist to the Geological Survey, by\r\nwhich a more suitable income was found for him. His official duties\r\nwere at first in the Geological Museum of the Survey, but were\r\ndistinguished from those of the special Palæontologist, Mr. Harvey.\r\nHis income was now assured, and for the rest of his life, until\r\ntowards its close, when he retired to Eastbourne, he lived the\r\nordinary life of a professional man of science in London. He was now\r\nable to marry, and on July 21, 1855, he was married to a lady whom he\r\nhad met in Sydney in 1847, and whom he had not seen since the\r\n_Rattlesnake_ left Sydney finally in the beginning of May, 1850.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1856, 1857, and 1858, he held the post of Fullerian\r\nProfessor of Physiology in the Royal Institution, choosing as the\r\ntitle of his first two courses of lectures Physiology and Comparative\r\nAnatomy, as he still cherished the idea of being in the first place a\r\nphysiologist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY, 1857 Reproduced by permission from\r\n_Natural Science_, vol. vii., No. 42]\r\n\r\n     \"Moreover,\" writes Professor Michael Foster, \"like most other\r\n     young professional men of science, he had to eke out his not too\r\n     ample income by labours undertaken chiefly for their pecuniary\r\n     reward. He acted as examiner, conducting for instance, during the\r\n     years 1856 to 1863, and again 1865 to 1870, the examinations in\r\n     physiology and comparative anatomy at the University of London,\r\n     making even an examination paper feel the influence of the new\r\n     spirit in biology; and among his examinees at that time there was\r\n     at least one who, knowing Huxley's writings, but his writings\r\n     only, looked forward to the _viva voce_ test, not as a trial but\r\n     as an occasion of delight. He wrote almost incessantly for all\r\n     editors who were prepared to give adequate pay to a pen able to\r\n     deal with scientific themes in a manner at once exact and\r\n     popular, incisive and correct. During this period he was\r\n     gradually passing from his first anatomical love, the structure\r\n     of the Invertebrates, to Vertebrate work, and although he\r\n     continued to take a deep interest in the course of the progress\r\n     of research in that group of animals, the publication of his\r\n     great work on oceanic hydrozoa by the Ray Society was the last\r\n     piece of important work he wrote upon any anatomical subject\r\n     apart from vertebrates. His work in connection with the\r\n     Geological Survey naturally attracted his attention most closely\r\n     to vertebrates, and, towards the close of the fifties, he was led\r\n     to make a special study of vertebrate embryology, a subject which\r\n     the investigations of Kölliker and others in Germany were\r\n     bringing into prominence. The first result of this new direction\r\n     of his enquiries was embodied in a Croonian Lecture delivered in\r\n     1858 'On the Theory of the Vertebrate Skull.' Sir Richard Owen,\r\n     who was at that time the leading vertebrate anatomist in England,\r\n     had given his support to an extremely complicated view of the\r\n     skull as being formed of a series of expanded vertebræ moulded\r\n     together. The theory was really a legacy from an old German\r\n     school of which the chief members were Goethe, the poet, and\r\n     Oken, a naturalist, who was more of a metaphysical philosopher\r\n     than of a morphologist. Huxley pointed out the futility of\r\n     attempting to regard the skull as a series of segments, and of\r\n     supporting this view by trusting to superficial resemblances and\r\n     abstract reasoning, when there was a definite method by which the\r\n     actual building up of the skull might be followed. Following the\r\n     lines laid down by Rathke, another of the great Germans from\r\n     whose investigations he was always so willing to find\r\n     corroboration and assistance in his own labours, he traced the\r\n     actual development of the skull in the individual. He shewed\r\n     that the foundations of the skull and of the backbone were laid\r\n     down in a fashion quite different, and that it was impossible to\r\n     regard both skull and backbone as modifications of a common type\r\n     laid down right along the axis of the body. The spinal column and\r\n     the skull start from the same primitive condition, whence they\r\n     immediately begin to diverge. It may be true to say that there is\r\n     a primitive identity of structure between the spinal or vertebral\r\n     column and the skull; but it is no more true that the adult skull\r\n     is a modified vertebral column than it would be to affirm that\r\n     the vertebral column is a modified skull.\"\r\n\r\nSince this famous lecture, a number of distinguished anatomists have\r\nstudied the development of the skull more fully; but they have not\r\ndeparted from the methods of investigation laid down by Huxley, and\r\ntheir conclusions have differed only in greater elaboration of detail\r\nfrom the broad lines laid down by him. Apart from its direct\r\nscientific value, this lecture was of importance as marking the place\r\nto which Huxley had attained in the scientific world. Two years later,\r\nit is true, the London _Times_, referring to a famous debate at a\r\nmeeting of the British Association at Oxford, spoke of him as \"a Mr.\r\nHuxley\"; but in the scientific world he was accepted as the leader of\r\nthe younger anatomists, and as one at least capable of rivalling Owen,\r\nwho was then at the height of his fame. The Croonian Lecture was in a\r\nsense a deliberate challenge to Owen, and in these days before Darwin,\r\nto challenge Owen was to claim equality with the greatest name in\r\nanatomical science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCREATURES OF THE PAST\r\n\r\n     Beginning Palæontological Work--Fossil Amphibia and\r\n     Reptilia--Ancestry of Birds--Ancestry of the Horse--Imperfect\r\n     European Series Completed by Marsh's American Fossils--Meaning of\r\n     Geological Contemporaneity--Uniformitarianism and Catastrophism\r\n     Compared with Evolution in Geology--Age of the\r\n     Earth--Intermediate and Linear Types.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Huxley took a post connected with Geology only because it was\r\nthe most convenient opening for him, it was not long before he became\r\ndeeply interested not only in the fossils, which at first he despised,\r\nbut in the general problems of geology. He began by co-operation with\r\nMr. Salter in the determination of fossils for the Geological Survey.\r\nThe mere work of defining genera and species and naming and describing\r\nnew species appealed very little to him. He had none of the\r\ncollector's passion for new species; his interest in a creature being\r\nnot whether or no it was new to science, but what general problems of\r\nbiology its structure helped to elucidate. While he assisted in the\r\nroutine work of determining the zoölogical position of the fossils\r\nsent in to the museum by the Survey, he carried investigations much\r\nfarther than the duties of the post required when interesting\r\nzoölogical problems arose. His earliest notes were written in\r\nassociation with his colleague, and consisted of technical\r\ndescriptions of some small fossils from the Downton Sandstones which\r\nwere supposed to be fish-shields. The peculiarities of structure\r\npresented by these aroused his interest, and he began an elaborate\r\nseries of investigations upon palæozoic fishes in general. Earlier\r\nzoölogists, such as the great Agassiz, had devoted most of their\r\nattention to careful and exact description of the different fossil\r\nfishes with which they became acquainted. Huxley at once began to\r\ninvestigate the relations that existed among the different kinds of\r\nstructure exhibited in the different fish. He laid down the lines upon\r\nwhich future work has been conducted, and, precisely as he did in the\r\ncase of molluscs, he started future investigators upon lines of\r\nresearch the ends of which have not yet been reached. His work upon\r\n_Devonian Fishes_, published in 1861, threw an entirely new light upon\r\nthe affinities of these creatures, and still remains a standard work.\r\n\r\nHe made a similar, although less important, series of investigations\r\nupon some of the great extinct Crustacea; but, perhaps, his most\r\nimportant palæontological work was done later, after he had been\r\nconvinced by Darwin of the fact of evolution. In 1855 he had expressed\r\nthe opinion that the study of fossils was hopeless if one sought in it\r\nconfirmation of the doctrine of evolution; but five-and-twenty years'\r\ncontinuous work completely reversed his opinion, and in 1881,\r\naddressing the British Association at York he declared that \"if\r\nzoölogists and embryologists had not put forward the theory, it would\r\nhave been necessary for palæontologists to invent it.\" In three\r\nspecial groups of animals his study of fossils enabled him to assist\r\nin bridging over the gaps between surviving groups of creatures by\r\nstudy of creatures long extinct. He began to study the structure of\r\nthe Labyrinthodonts, a group of extinct monsters which received their\r\nname from the peculiar structure of their teeth. He published\r\nelaborate descriptions of Anthracosaurus from the coal-measures of\r\nNorthumberland, of Loxomma from the lower carboniferous of Scotland,\r\nand of several small forms from the coal-measures of Kilkenny, in\r\nIreland, as well as describing skulls from Africa and a number of\r\nfragmentary bones from different localities. But in all this work it\r\nwas the morphology of the creatures that interested him, and the light\r\nwhich their structure threw upon the structure of each other and of\r\ntheir nearest allies. He shewed that these monsters stood on the\r\nborderland between fishes, amphibia, and reptiles, and he added much\r\nto our knowledge of the true structure of these great groups. Next, he\r\nturned to the extinct reptiles of the Mesozoic age. It was generally\r\nbelieved that the Pterodactyls, or flying reptiles, were the nearest\r\nallies of birds, but Huxley insisted that the resemblances between the\r\nwings were simply such superficial resemblances as necessarily exist\r\nin organs adapted to the same purpose. About the same time, Cope in\r\nAmerica, and Phillips and Huxley, in England, from study of the bones\r\nof the Dinosaurs, another great group of extinct reptiles, declared\r\nthat these were the nearest in structure to birds. In association with\r\nthe upright posture, the ilium or great haunch-bone of birds extends\r\nfar forwards in front of the articulation of the thigh-bone, so that\r\nthe pelvis in this region has a T-shape, the ilium forming the\r\ncross-bar of the T, and the femur or thigh-bone the downward limb.\r\nHuxley shewed that a large number of the Dinosaurs had this and other\r\npeculiarities of the bird's pelvis, and separated these into a group\r\nwhich he called the \"Ornithoscelida,\" seeing in them the closest\r\nrepresentatives of the probable reptilian ancestors of birds. While\r\nfurther work and the discovery of a still greater number of extinct\r\nreptiles has made it less probable that these were the actual\r\nancestors of birds, Huxley's work in this, as in the many other cases\r\nwe have shown, proved not only of great value in itself, but led to a\r\ncontinually increasing series of investigations by others. It is not\r\nalways the pioneer that makes the greatest discoveries in a new\r\ncountry, but the work of the pioneer makes possible and easier the\r\nmore assured discoveries of his followers.\r\n\r\nA third great piece of palæontological investigation with which the\r\nname of Huxley will always be associated, is the most familiar of all\r\nthe instances taken from fossils in support of the evolution of\r\nanimals. This famous case is the pedigree of the horse. In 1870, in an\r\naddress delivered to the Geological Society of London, Huxley had\r\nshewn that there was a series of animals leading backwards from the\r\nmodern horse to a more generalised creature called Anchitherium, and\r\nfound in the rocks of the Miocene period. He suggested that there\r\nwere, no doubt, similar fossils leading still further backwards\r\ntowards the common mammalian type of animal, with five fingers and\r\nfive toes, and went the length of suggesting one or two fossils which\r\nmight stand in the direct line of ancestry. But in 1876 he visited\r\nAmerica, and had the opportunity of consulting the marvellous series\r\nof fossils which Professor Marsh had collected from American Tertiary\r\nbeds. Professor Marsh allowed him the freest use of his materials and\r\nof his conclusions, and the credit of the final result is to be\r\nshared at least equally between Marsh and Huxley. The final result was\r\na demonstrative proof of the possible course of evolution of the\r\nhorse, given in a lecture delivered by Huxley in New York on Sept. 22,\r\n1876, and illustrated by drawings from specimens in Marsh's\r\ncollection. The matter of the lecture has become so important a part\r\nof all descriptive writing on evolution, and the treatment is so\r\ncharacteristic of Huxley's brilliant exposition, that it is worth\r\nwhile to make some rather long quotations from it. The lecture was\r\npublished in the New York papers, and afterwards with other matter\r\nformed a volume of _American Addresses_, published by Macmillan, in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n     \"In most quadrupeds, as in ourselves, the forearm contains\r\n     distinct bones called the radius and the ulna. The corresponding\r\n     region in the horse seems at first to possess but one bone.\r\n     Careful observation, however, enables us to distinguish in this\r\n     bone a part which clearly answers to the upper end of the ulna.\r\n     This is closely united with the chief mass of the bone which\r\n     represents the radius, and runs out into a slender shaft which\r\n     may be traced for some distance downwards on the back of the\r\n     radius, and then in most cases thins out and vanishes. It takes\r\n     still more trouble to make sure of what is nevertheless the fact,\r\n     that a small part of the lower end of the bone of the horse's\r\n     forearm, which is only distinct in a very young foal, is really\r\n     the lower extremity of the ulna.\r\n\r\n      \"What is commonly called the knee of a horse is its wrist. The\r\n     'cannon bone' answers to the middle bone of the five metacarpal\r\n     bones which support the palm of the hand in ourselves. The\r\n     'pastern,' 'coronary,' and 'coffin' bones of veterinarians answer\r\n     to the joints of our middle fingers, while the hoof is simply a\r\n     greatly enlarged and thickened nail. But, if what lies below the\r\n     horse's 'knee' thus corresponds to the middle finger in\r\n     ourselves, what has become of the four other fingers or digits?\r\n     We find in the places of the second and fourth digits only two\r\n     slender splint-like bones, about two-thirds as long as the cannon\r\n     bone, which gradually taper to their lower ends and bear no\r\n     finger joints, or, as they are termed, phalanges. Sometimes small\r\n     bony or gristly nodules are to be found at the bases of these two\r\n     metacarpal splints, and it is probable that these represent\r\n     rudiments of the first and fifth digits. Thus the part of the\r\n     horse's skeleton which corresponds with that of the human hand\r\n     contains one overgrown middle digit, and at least two imperfect\r\n     lateral digits; and these answer, respectively, to the third, the\r\n     second, and the fourth digits in man.\r\n\r\n      \"Corresponding modifications are found in the hind limb. In\r\n     ourselves, and in most quadrupeds, the leg contains two distinct\r\n     bones, a large bone, the tibia, and a smaller and more slender\r\n     bone, the fibula. But, in the horse, the fibula seems, at first,\r\n     to be reduced to its upper end; a short slender bone united with\r\n     the tibia and ending in a point below occupying its place.\r\n     Examination of the lower end of a young foal's shin-bone,\r\n     however, shews a distinct portion of osseous matter, which is the\r\n     lower end of the fibula; so that the apparently single lower end\r\n     of the shin-bone is really made up of the coalesced ends of the\r\n     tibia and fibula, just as the apparently single lower end of the\r\n     fore-arm bone is composed of the coalesced radius and ulna.\r\n\r\n      \"The heel of the horse is the part commonly known as the hock;\r\n     the hinder cannon bone answers to the middle metatarsal bone of\r\n     the human foot, the pastern, coronary, and coffin bones, to the\r\n     middle-toe bones; the hind hoof to the nail, as in the fore foot.\r\n     And, as in the fore foot, there are merely two splints to\r\n     represent the second and fourth toes. Sometimes a rudiment of a\r\n     fifth toe appears to be traceable.\"\r\n\r\nHaving in the same fashion described the highly complicated and\r\npeculiar structure of the teeth of modern horses, Huxley proceeded:\r\n\r\n     \"To anyone who is acquainted with the morphology of vertebrated\r\n     animals, these characteristic structures of the horse show that\r\n     it deviates widely from the general structure of mammals; and\r\n     that the horse type is, in many respects, an extreme modification\r\n     of the general mammalian plan. The least modified mammals, in\r\n     fact, have the radius and ulna, the tibia and fibula, distinct\r\n     and separate. They have five distinct and complete digits on each\r\n     foot, and no one of these digits is very much larger than the\r\n     rest. Moreover, in the least modified mammals, the total number\r\n     of the teeth is very generally forty-four, while in the horse the\r\n     usual number is forty, and, in the absence of the canines, it may\r\n     be reduced to thirty-six; the incisor teeth are devoid of the\r\n     fold seen in those of the horse; the grinders regularly diminish\r\n     in size from the middle of the series to its front end; while\r\n     their crowns are short, early attain their full length, and\r\n     exhibit simple ridges or tubercles, in place of the complex\r\n     foldings of the horse's grinders.\r\n\r\n      \"Hence the general principles of the hypothesis of evolution\r\n     lead to the conclusion that the horse must have been derived from\r\n     some quadruped which possessed five complete digits on each foot;\r\n     which had the bones of the forearm and of the leg complete and\r\n     separate; and which possessed forty-four teeth, among which the\r\n     crown of the incisors and grinders had a simple structure; while\r\n     the latter gradually increased in size from before backwards, at\r\n     any rate in the anterior part of the series, and had short\r\n     crowns.\r\n\r\n      \"And if the horse had been thus evolved, and the remains of the\r\n     different stages of its evolution have been preserved, they ought\r\n     to present us with a series of forms in which the number of the\r\n     digits becomes reduced; the bones of the forearm and leg\r\n     gradually take on the equine condition; and the form and\r\n     arrangement of the teeth successively approximate to those which\r\n     obtain in existing horses.\r\n\r\n      \"Let us turn to the facts and see how far they fulfill these\r\n     requirements of the doctrine of evolution.\r\n\r\n      \"In Europe abundant remains of horses are found in the\r\n     Quaternary and later Tertiary strata as far as the Pliocene\r\n     formation. But these horses, which are so common in the\r\n     cave-deposits and in the gravel of Europe, are in all essential\r\n     respects like existing horses, and that is true of all the horses\r\n     of the later part of the Pliocene epoch. But, in the deposits\r\n     which belong to the earlier Pliocene, and later Miocene epochs,\r\n     and which occur in Britain, in France, in Germany, in Greece, in\r\n     India, we find animals which are extremely like horses--which in\r\n     fact are so similar to horses, that you may follow descriptions\r\n     given in works upon the anatomy of the horse, upon the skeletons\r\n     of these animals--but which differ in some important particulars.\r\n     For example, the structure of their fore and hind limbs is\r\n     somewhat different. The bones, which, in the horse are\r\n     represented by two long splints, imperfect below, are as long as\r\n     the middle metacarpal and metatarsal bones; and, attached to the\r\n     extremity of each, is a digit with three joints of the same\r\n     general character as those of the middle digit, only very much\r\n     smaller. These small digits are so disposed that they could have\r\n     had but very little functional importance, and they must have\r\n     been rather of the nature of the dew-claws, such as are to be\r\n     found in many ruminant animals. The _Hipparion_, as the extinct\r\n     European three-toed horse is called, in fact presents a foot\r\n     similar to that of the American _Protohippus_ except that in\r\n     _Hipparion_ the smaller digits are situated further back, and are\r\n     of smaller proportional size than in the _Protohippus_.\r\n\r\n      \"The ulna is slightly more distinct than in the horse; and the\r\n     whole length of it, as a very slender shaft, intimately united\r\n     with the radius, is completely traceable. The fibula appears to\r\n     be in the same condition as in the horse. The teeth of the\r\n     _Hipparion_ are essentially similar to those of the horse, but\r\n     the pattern of the grinders is in some respects a little more\r\n     complex, and there is a depression on the face of the skull in\r\n     front of the orbit, which is not seen in existing horses.\r\n\r\n      \"In the earlier Miocene and perhaps in the Eocene deposits of\r\n     some parts of Europe, another distinct animal has been\r\n     discovered, which Cuvier, who first described some fragments of\r\n     it, considered to be a _Palæotherium_, but as further discoveries\r\n     threw new light on its structure, it was recognised as a distinct\r\n     genus, under the name of _Anchitherium_.\r\n\r\n      \"In its general characters the skeleton of _Anchitherium_ is\r\n     very similar to that of the horse, in fact Lartet and De\r\n     Blainville called it _Palæotherium equinum_ or _Hippoides_; and\r\n     De Cristol, in 1847, said that it differed from _Hipparion_ in\r\n     little more than the characters of the teeth, and gave it the\r\n     name of _Hipparitherium_. Each foot possesses three complete\r\n     toes: while the lateral toes are much larger in proportion to the\r\n     middle toe than in _Hipparion_, and doubtless rested on the\r\n     ground in ordinary locomotion. The ulna is complete and quite\r\n     distinct from the radius, although firmly united with the latter.\r\n     The fibula seems also to have been complete; its lower end,\r\n     though intimately united with that of the tibia, is clearly\r\n     united with that of the latter bone. There are forty-four teeth;\r\n     the incisors have no strong pit. The canines seem to have been\r\n     well developed in both sexes. The first of the seven grinders,\r\n     which, as I have said, is frequently absent, and, when it does\r\n     exist, is small in the horse, is a good-sized and permanent\r\n     tooth, while the grinder which follows it is but little larger\r\n     than the hinder ones. The crowns of the grinders are short, and,\r\n     although the fundamental pattern of the horse-tooth is\r\n     discernible, the front and back ridges are less curved, the\r\n     accessory pillars are wanting, and the valleys, much shallower,\r\n     are not filled up with cement.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after describing his early efforts to trace the descent of the\r\nhorse from European fossils, Huxley goes on to relate the new light\r\nthrown on the matter from the American discoveries of Professor Marsh:\r\n\r\n     \"You are all aware that, when your country was first discovered\r\n     by Europeans, there were no traces of the existence of the horse\r\n     in any part of the American continent. The accounts of the\r\n     conquest of Mexico dwell on the astonishment of the natives of\r\n     that country when they first became acquainted with that\r\n     astounding phenomenon, a man seated upon a horse. Nevertheless,\r\n     the investigations of American geologists have proved that the\r\n     remains of horses occur in the most superficial deposits of both\r\n     North and South America, just as they do in Europe. Therefore,\r\n     for some reason or other,--no feasible suggestion on that\r\n     subject, so far as I know, has been made,--the horse must have\r\n     died out on this continent at some period preceding the discovery\r\n     of America. Of late years there has been discovered in your\r\n     Western territories that marvellous accumulation of deposits,\r\n     admirably adapted for the preservation of organic remains, to\r\n     which I referred the other evening, and which furnishes us with a\r\n     consecutive series of records of the fauna of the older half of\r\n     the Tertiary epoch, for which we have no parallel in Europe. The\r\n     researches of Leidy and others have shewn that forms allied to\r\n     the _Hipparion_ and the _Anchitherium_ are to be found among\r\n     these remains. Rut it is only recently that the admirably\r\n     conceived and most thoroughly and patiently worked-out\r\n     investigations of Professor Marsh have given us a just idea of\r\n     the vast fossil wealth and of the scientific importance of these\r\n     deposits. I have had the advantage of glancing over the\r\n     collections in Yale Museum; and I can truly say that, so far as\r\n     my knowledge extends, there is no collection from any one region\r\n     and series of strata comparable, for extent, or for care with\r\n     which the remains have been got together, or for their scientific\r\n     importance, to the series of fossils which he has deposited\r\n     there. This vast collection has yielded evidence bearing on the\r\n     question of the pedigree of the horse of the most striking\r\n     character. It tends to show that we must look to America rather\r\n     than to Europe for the original seat of the equine series; and\r\n     that the archaic forms and successive modifications of the\r\n     horse's ancestry are far better preserved here than in Europe.\r\n\r\n      \"Professor Marsh's kindness has enabled me to put before you a\r\n     diagram, every figure of which is an actual representation of\r\n     some specimen which is to be seen at Yale at this present time.\r\n\r\n      \"The succession of forms which he has brought together carries\r\n     us from the top to the bottom of the Tertiaries. Firstly, there\r\n     is the true horse. Next we have the American Pliocene form of the\r\n     horse (_Pliohippus_): in the conformation of its limbs it\r\n     presents some very slight deviations from the ordinary horse, and\r\n     the crowns of the grinding teeth are shorter. Then comes the\r\n     _Protohippus_, which represents the European _Hipparion_, having\r\n     one large digit and two small ones on each foot, and the general\r\n     characters of the forearm and leg to which I have referred. But\r\n     it is more valuable than the European _Hipparion_ for the reason\r\n     that it is devoid of some of the peculiarities of that\r\n     form--peculiarities which tend to show that the European\r\n     _Hipparion_ is rather a member of a collateral branch than a form\r\n     in the direct line of succession. Next, in the backward order in\r\n     time, is the _Miohippus_, which corresponds pretty nearly with\r\n     the _Anchitherium_ of Europe. It presents three complete\r\n     toes--one large median and two smaller lateral ones: and there\r\n     is a rudiment of that digit which answers to the little finger of\r\n     the human race.\r\n\r\n      \"The European pedigree of the horse stops here; in the America\r\n     Tertiaries, on the contrary, the series of ancestral equine forms\r\n     is continued into the Eocene formations. An older Miocene form,\r\n     called _Mesohippus_, has three toes in front, with a large\r\n     splint-like rudiment representing the little finger; and three\r\n     toes behind. The radius and ulna, the tibia and fibula, are\r\n     distinct, and the short crowned molar teeth are _Anchitherioid_\r\n     in pattern.\r\n\r\n      \"But the most important discovery of all is the _Orohippus_\r\n     which comes from the Eocene formation, and is the oldest member\r\n     of the equine series yet known. Here we find four complete toes\r\n     on the front limb, three toes on the hind limb, a well-developed\r\n     ulna, a well-developed fibula, and short-crowned grinders of a\r\n     simple pattern.\r\n\r\n      \"Thus, thanks to these important researches, it has become\r\n     evident that, so far as our present knowledge extends, the\r\n     history of the horse type is exactly and precisely that which\r\n     could have been predicted from a knowledge of the principles of\r\n     evolution; and the knowledge we now possess justifies us\r\n     completely in the anticipation that, when the still lower Eocene\r\n     deposits, and those which belong to the Cretaceous period have\r\n     yielded up their remains of ancestral equine animals, we shall\r\n     find, first, a form with four complete toes and a rudiment of the\r\n     innermost or first digit in front, with probably a rudiment of\r\n     the fifth digit in the hind foot; while, in the older forms, the\r\n     series of digits will be more and more complete until we come to\r\n     the five-toed animals, in which, if the doctrine of evolution is\r\n     well founded, the whole series must have taken its origin.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Huxley was successful, when only the ancestry to Miocene times\r\nwas known, in predicting the discovery of older forms in the older\r\nMiocene and upper Eocene, so his prediction of older Eocene forms\r\ncarrying the chain back to five-toed creatures proved correct. One of\r\nthe new links was indeed discovered before his lecture had passed\r\nthrough the press, and he was able to add in a footnote some details\r\nof the structure of the four-toed Eohippus from the lower Eocene\r\nbeds. Further discoveries have connected these with the five-toed\r\nancestors of the Tapirs, and there is the strongest reason to suppose\r\nthat we now know as nearly as possible the line of ancestry of the\r\nhorse back to the primitive forms common to all the higher mammals. It\r\nwould, of course, be beyond possibility of proof that the exact\r\nfossils described were the actual ancestors of the horse; but that\r\nthey are exceedingly close allies of these, and that among them some\r\nactual ancestors exist cannot reasonably be doubted.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had embarked upon geological work with some distaste,\r\nHuxley became very closely associated with it as years went on, and\r\nindeed, about the seventies, had abandoned his intention to devote\r\nhimself specially to physiology, and declared himself to be in the\r\nfirst place a palæontologist. In 1876 he had accomplished so much that\r\nthe Geological Society gave him its chief distinction, awarding him\r\nthe Wollaston Medal in recognition of his services to geological\r\nscience. He acted as Secretary to the Geological Society from 1859 to\r\n1862, and he was President from 1868 to 1870. In 1862, the President\r\nbeing incapacitated, Huxley delivered as Deputy-President the\r\nPresidential Address. This address is famous in the history of\r\ngeology, because for the first time it stated clearly and in permanent\r\nform a doctrine now taken as a first principle in all geological\r\ntext-books. A large part of geology is the attempt to read the past\r\nhistory of the earth from the evidence given by the successive strata\r\nof rocks that form its crust.\r\n\r\n     \"It is mathematically certain that, in any given vertical linear\r\n     section of an undisturbed series of sedimentary deposits, the bed\r\n     which lies lowest is the oldest. In many other vertical linear\r\n     sections of the same series, of course corresponding beds will\r\n     occur in a similar order.\"\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance to determine whether or no the same\r\nseries occurring vertically in the same order in different parts of\r\nthe earth were deposited at the same time. To explain the problem,\r\nHuxley took the following concrete example:\r\n\r\n     \"The Lias of England and the Lias of Germany, the Cretaceous\r\n     rocks of Britain and the Cretaceous rocks of Southern India, are\r\n     termed by geologists 'Contemporaneous' formations; but whenever\r\n     any thoughtful geologist is asked whether he means to say that\r\n     they were deposited at the same time, he says, 'No, only within\r\n     the same great epoch.' And if, in pursuing the enquiry, he is\r\n     asked what may be the approximate value in time of a 'great\r\n     epoch'--whether it means a hundred years, or a thousand, or a\r\n     million, or ten million years--his reply is, 'I cannot tell.'\"\r\n\r\nMost of the standard writers on palæontology had assumed that the\r\npresence in two beds at different parts of the world of the same\r\nfossils implied that the beds were contemporaneous, that they had been\r\nformed at the same time. Huxley pointed out that the fact of identical\r\nfossils being present was, on the whole, evidence against the beds\r\nhaving been formed at the same time. Even some of the older writers\r\nwho believed in species having been created at definite places at\r\ndefinite times had seen that time must have been required for sets of\r\nanimals to wander from the places in which they had come into\r\nexistence. The newer theory of evolution was equally opposed to the\r\nnotion of the appearance of similar animals at the same time on\r\nfar-distant parts of the earth. For such reasons he proposed to reject\r\nthe use of the word _Contemporaneous_ as applied to rockbeds in\r\ndifferent localities which contained the same fossils, and to replace\r\nit by the word _Homotaxial_, which meant no more than that the beds\r\noccupied corresponding places in the geological history of the earth.\r\nHuxley did not pretend that these arguments were entirely original:\r\nthey represented the drift of the best geological opinion, and he\r\nseized hold of them and set them down as permanent geological truths.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, in a Presidential Address to the Geological Society, Huxley\r\ntook up one of the burning questions of the day. In the early part of\r\nthe century, the discoveries of geologists had been the occasion of\r\ngreat distress to those good people who clung to a literal\r\ninterpretation of everything in the Bible. Long before the doctrine of\r\nevolution and the descent of man from lower animals had taken practical\r\nshape, there had been a battle royal between geologists who declared\r\nthat the earth was many million years old, and had been inhabited at\r\nleast by animals and plants for enormous periods, and those who clung to\r\nthe traditional chronology which placed the date of creation only a few\r\nthousand years from now. The continued progress of geology, and the\r\nsturdy championship of it by men like Sedgwick, Chalmers, and Buckland,\r\nwho were at the same time reputable theologians and distinguished men of\r\nscience, had decided the battle in favour of the conclusions of science,\r\nand it was accepted generally that the earth was almost indefinitely\r\nold. At the same time, another and more strictly scientific dispute had\r\nbeen in progress. The older school of geologists, looking on the face of\r\nthe world, and seeing it scarred by mighty fissures, displaying huge\r\ndistortions of the beds in the crust, had argued that geological change\r\nhad taken place by a series of mighty catastrophes. The tremendous\r\nresults which they saw seemed to them only possible on the theory that\r\nunusual and gigantic displays of force had caused them. On the other\r\nhand, Hutton and Lyell attempted to find adequate explanation of the\r\ngreatest changes in the slow forces which may be seen in operation at\r\nthe present time. Slow movements of upheaval and depression, amounting\r\nat most to an inch or two in a century, may be shown to be actually in\r\nexistence now, and such slow changes acting for very many centuries\r\nwould account for the raising of continents above the sea, so that old\r\nsea-bottoms became the surface of the land, and for the depression of\r\nland areas so that new sedimentary rocks might be deposited upon them.\r\nThey shewed how air and water slowly crumbled away the hardest rocks,\r\nand how rivers deepened their beds steadily but excessively slowly; and\r\nthey held that while great catastrophic changes might occasionally have\r\noccurred, there was ample evidence of the present operation of forces\r\nwhich, granted sufficient time for their operation, would have made the\r\ncrust of the earth such as it is. This doctrine of _Uniformitarianism_,\r\nof the action of similar forces in the past and present history of the\r\nearth, had almost completely triumphed over the older catastrophic\r\nviews. As Huxley put it, the school of catastrophe put no limit to the\r\nviolence of forces which had operated; the uniformitarians put no limit\r\nto the length of time during which forces had operated.\r\n\r\n     \"Catastrophism has insisted upon the existence of a practically\r\n     unlimited bank of force, on which the theorist might draw; and it\r\n     has cherished the idea of development of the earth from a state\r\n     in which its form, and the forces which it exerted, were very\r\n     different from those which we now know.\r\n\r\n      \"Uniformitarianism, on the other hand, has with equal justice\r\n     insisted upon a practically unlimited bank of time, ready to\r\n     discount any quantity of hypothetical paper. It has kept before\r\n     our eyes the power of the infinitely little, time being granted,\r\n     and has compelled us to exhaust known causes before flying to the\r\n     unknown.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was a third influence at work in geology, an influence which\r\nmay best be described in Huxley's own words:\r\n\r\n     \"I shall not make what I have to say on this head clear unless I\r\n     diverge, or seem to diverge, for a while, from the direct path of\r\n     my discourse so far as to explain what I take to be the scope of\r\n     geology itself. I conceive geology to be the history of the\r\n     earth, in precisely the same sense as biology is the history of\r\n     living beings; and I trust you will not think that I am\r\n     overpowered by the influence of a dominant pursuit if I say that\r\n     I trace a close analogy between these two histories.\r\n\r\n      \"If I study a living being, under what heads does the knowledge\r\n     I obtain fall? I can learn its structure, or what we call its\r\n     Anatomy; and its development, or the series of changes it passes\r\n     through to acquire its complete structure. Then I find that the\r\n     living being has certain powers resulting from its own\r\n     activities, and the interaction of these with the activities of\r\n     other things--the knowledge of which is Physiology. Beyond this,\r\n     the living being has a position in space and time, which is its\r\n     Distribution. All these form the body of ascertainable facts\r\n     which constitute the _status quo_ of the living creature. But\r\n     these facts have their causes; and the ascertainment of these\r\n     causes is the doctrine of Ætiology.\r\n\r\n      \"If we consider what is knowable about the earth, we shall find\r\n     that such earth-knowledge--if I may so translate the word\r\n     geology--falls into the same categories.\r\n\r\n      \"What is termed stratigraphical geology is neither more nor less\r\n     than the anatomy of the earth; and the history of the succession\r\n     of the formations is a history of the succession of such\r\n     anatomies, or corresponds with development, as distinct from\r\n     generation.\r\n\r\n      \"The internal heat of the earth, the elevation and depression of\r\n     its crust, its belching forth of vapours, ashes, and lava, are\r\n     its activities, in as strict a sense as are warmth and the\r\n     movements and products of respiration the activities of an\r\n     animal. The phenomena of the seasons, of the trade-winds, of the\r\n     Gulf Stream, are as much the results of the reaction between\r\n     these inner activities and outward forces, as are the budding of\r\n     the leaves in spring, and their falling in autumn the effects of\r\n     the interaction between the organisation of a plant and the solar\r\n     light and heat. And, as the study of the activities of the living\r\n     being is called its physiology, so are these phenomena the\r\n     subject matter of an analogous telluric physiology, to which we\r\n     sometimes give the name of meteorology; sometimes of physical\r\n     geography, sometimes that of geology. Again, the earth has a\r\n     place in space and time, and relations to other bodies in both\r\n     these respects, which constitute its distribution. This subject\r\n     is usually left to the astronomer; but a knowledge of its broad\r\n     outlines seems to me to be an essential constituent of the stock\r\n     of geological ideas.\r\n\r\n      \"All that can be ascertained concerning the structure,\r\n     succession of conditions, actions, and position in space of the\r\n     earth, is the matter of its natural history. But, as in Biology,\r\n     there remains the matter of reasoning from these facts to their\r\n     causes, which is just as much science as the other, and indeed\r\n     more; and this constitutes geological ætiology.\r\n\r\n      \"Having regard to this general scheme of geological knowledge\r\n     and thought, it is obvious that geological speculation may be, so\r\n     to speak, anatomical and developmental speculation, so far as it\r\n     relates to points of stratigraphical arrangement which are out of\r\n     reach of direct observation; or, it may be physiological\r\n     speculation so far as it relates to undetermined problems\r\n     relative to the activities of the earth; or, it may be\r\n     distributional speculation, if it deals with modifications of the\r\n     earth's place in space; or, finally, it will be ætiological\r\n     speculation if it attempts to deduce the history of the world, as\r\n     a whole, from the known properties of the matter of the earth, in\r\n     the conditions in which the earth has been placed.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley then proceeded to shew that uniformitarianism and catastrophism\r\nhad neglected this last and most important branch of geology, the\r\nattempt to trace the interaction of causes which had brought the world\r\ninto its present condition. He gave a striking display of the wide\r\nknowledge of his reading by going back to the foundation of this branch\r\nof modern science, and giving a masterly account of the then\r\nlittle-known treatise of Immanuel Kant, who in 1775 had written _An\r\nAttempt to Account for the Constitutional and Mechanical Origin of the\r\nUniverse upon Newtonian Principles_. Next he declared that evolution\r\nembraced all that was sound in both catastrophism and uniformitarianism\r\nwhile rejecting the arbitrary limits and assumptions of both.\r\n\r\nFinally he came to the great question to which these observations upon\r\nthe existing schools of geology had led. The most distinguished\r\nphysicist of the age, then Sir William Thomson, now Lord Kelvin, and\r\nHuxley's immediate successor in the Presidential Chair of the Royal\r\nSociety, had stated that the English school of geology had assumed an\r\nimpossible age for the earth. By physical reasonings, Thomson stated\r\nthat he was able to prove \"That the existing state of things on the\r\nearth--all geological history showing continuity of life--must be\r\nlimited within some such period of time as one hundred million years.\"\r\nThis pronouncement had been received with acclamation by those who\r\nfeared the geological and biological sciences, as a sign of internal\r\ndissensions within the house of science. Huxley, then, as all through\r\nthe latter part of his life, at once constituted himself the champion\r\nof science, and, taking Thomson's arguments one by one, shewed by a\r\nseries of masterly deductions from known facts that there was a great\r\ndeal to be said for the other side, and that physicists were as little\r\ncertain as geologists could be of the exact duration of time that had\r\nelapsed since the dawn of life. His plea for more time since the\r\ncooling of the globe than physicists were willing to allow remains one\r\nof the classics of geological literature. But he carried the question\r\nmuch farther. The inference which was widely drawn by the enemies of\r\nevolution from the arguments of Sir William Thomson was that if\r\ngeologists had overestimated the age of the cooled earth there was not\r\ntime for the evolution of animals and plants to have taken place.\r\nHuxley pointed out a fact which should be quite obvious, but which\r\neven yet is frequently neglected. The evidence for the gradual\r\nappearance of life in the past history of the earth depends simply on\r\nthe fact that the successive forms of life appear in successive\r\nstrata, and the length of time taken for these changes simply depends\r\nupon the length of time which was taken up by the formation of the\r\nstrata. Our only reason for supposing the evolution of life, made\r\nplain by fossil records, to have taken place very slowly is that\r\ngeologists have stated that the deposition of the strata took place\r\nvery slowly. Whether these strata were deposited slowly or less\r\nslowly, we know that the forms of life changed at the same rate.\r\n\r\n     \"Biology takes her time from geology. The only reason we have for\r\n     believing in the slow rate of change in living forms is the fact\r\n     that they persist through a series of deposits which, geology\r\n     informs us, have taken a long while to make. If the geological\r\n     clock is wrong, all the naturalist will have to do is to modify\r\n     his notion of the rapidity of change accordingly; and I venture\r\n     to point out that, when we are told that the limitation of the\r\n     period during which living beings have inhabited this planet to\r\n     one, two, or three hundred million years requires a complete\r\n     revolution in geological speculation, the _onus probandi_ rests\r\n     on the maker of the assertion, who brings forward not a shadow of\r\n     evidence in its support.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps, although this is now an old controversy, it is worth while\r\nto recall that the keenness of Huxley's language was not directed\r\nagainst Sir William Thomson, between whom and Huxley there was no more\r\nthan the desire to argue out an interesting scientific question upon\r\nwhich their conclusions differed, but between Huxley and those\r\noutsiders who were always ready to turn any dubious question in\r\nscience into an argument discrediting the general conclusions of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe last time that Huxley occupied the Presidential Chair of the\r\nGeological Society was in 1870, and he occupied his Presidential\r\naddress by a review of the \"old judgments\" which he had given in the\r\ncourse of his first address in 1862. The address was entitled\r\n\"Palæontology and Evolution,\" and the most important part of it was a\r\ncomplete withdrawal of the fears he had expressed that geology would\r\nnot supply definite evidence of the transformation of species.\r\nImportant discoveries had come thick and fast; and, at least in the\r\ncase of the higher vertebrates, he declared that, however one might\r\n\"sift and criticise them,\" they left a clear balance in favour of the\r\ndoctrine of the evolution of living forms one from another. But, with\r\nhis usual critical spirit, examining arguments that bore against a\r\nconclusion for which he hoped almost more stringently than arguments\r\napparently favourable to what he expected to be true, Huxley made an\r\nimportant distinction, the value of which becomes more and more\r\napparent as time goes on. In the first flush of enthusiasm for\r\nDarwinism, zoölogists and palæontologists allowed their zeal to outrun\r\ndiscretion in the formation of family trees. They examined large\r\nseries of living or extinct creatures, and so soon as they found\r\ngradations of structure present, they arranged their specimens in a\r\nlinear series, from the simplest to the most complex, and declared\r\nthat the arrangement was a representation of the family tree. The fact\r\nthat the line of descent apparently could have followed along the\r\ndirection they suggested they were inclined to take as evidence that\r\nit had so followed. Huxley made the most careful distinction between\r\nwhat he called intermediate types and types with a right to be placed\r\nin linear order,\r\n\r\n     Every fossil which takes an intermediate place between forms of\r\n     life already known may be said, so far as it is intermediate, to\r\n     be evidence in favour of evolution, inasmuch as it shews a\r\n     possible road by which evolution may have taken place. But the\r\n     mere discovery of such a form does not, in itself, prove that\r\n     evolution took place by and through it, nor does it constitute\r\n     more than a presumptive evidence in favour of evolution in\r\n     general. The fact that _Anoplotheridæ_ are intermediate between\r\n     pigs and ruminants does not tell us whether the ruminants have\r\n     come from the pigs or the pigs from the ruminants, or both from\r\n     _Anoplotheridæ_, or whether pigs, ruminants, and _Anoplotheridæ_;\r\n     alike may not have diverged from some common stock.\r\n\r\nA familiar instance will make the point at issue plain. Everyone knows\r\nthat in many respects, in the structure of the skeleton, and the curve\r\nof the backbone, and in the development of the brain, the man-like\r\nmonkeys, the gorilla and its allies, are intermediate between man and\r\nthe lower monkeys. In the early days of evolution it was assumed\r\nfrequently that the gorilla, etc., were therefore to be regarded as\r\nancestors of man, and they appear as such in more than one well-known\r\ntreatise on evolutionary biology. We now know that it is exceedingly\r\nprobable that the gorilla and its allies, although truly intermediate\r\ntypes, and truly shewing a possible path of evolution from the brute\r\nto man, are not the actual ancestors of man, but cousins, descendants\r\nlike man from some more or less remote common ancestor. And the\r\ntendency of recent advances in knowledge is more and more to throw\r\nstress on the value of Huxley's distinction, and to minimise confusion\r\nbetween \"intermediate\" and truly ancestral types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHUXLEY AND DARWIN\r\n\r\n     Early Ideas on Evolution--Erasmus Darwin--Lamarck--Herbert\r\n     Spencer--Difference between Evolution and Natural\r\n     Selection--Huxley's Preparation for Evolution--The Novelty of\r\n     Natural Selection--The Advantage of Natural Selection as a\r\n     Working Hypothesis--Huxley's Unchanged Position with regard to\r\n     Evolution and Natural Selection from 1860 to 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom our attempt to place together as much as possible of Huxley's\r\ngeological work in the last chapter, it followed that we anticipated\r\nmuch that falls properly within this chapter. The year 1859, the date\r\nof publication of _The Origin of Species_, is a momentous date in the\r\nhistory of this century, as it was the year in which there was given\r\nto the world a theory that not only revolutionised scientific opinion,\r\nbut altered the trend of almost every branch of thought. To understand\r\nthis great change, and the part played in it by Huxley, it is\r\nnecessary to be quite clear as to what Darwin did. In the first place,\r\nhe did not invent evolution. The idea that all the varied structures\r\nin the world, the divergent forms of rocks and minerals and crystals,\r\nthe innumerable trees and herbs that cover the face of the earth like\r\na mantle, and all the animal host of creatures great and small that\r\ndwell on the land or dart through the air or people the waters,--that\r\nall these had arisen by natural laws from a primitive unformed\r\nmaterial was known to the Greeks, was developed by the Romans, and\r\neven received the approval of early Christian Fathers, who wrote long\r\nbefore the idea had been invented that the naive legends of the Old\r\nTestament were an authoritative and literal account of the origin of\r\nthe world. After a long interval, in which scientific thought was\r\nstifled by theological dogmatism, the theory of evolution,\r\nparticularly in its application to animals, began to reappear, long\r\nbefore Darwin published _The Origin of Species_. Buffon, the great\r\nFrench naturalist, and Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles, had\r\nexpressed in the clearest way the possibility that species had not\r\nbeen created independently, but had arisen from other species. Lamarck\r\nhad worked out a theory of descent in the fullest detail, and regarded\r\nit as the foundation of the whole science of biology. He taught that\r\nthe beginning of life consisted only of the simplest and lowest plants\r\nand animals; that the more complex animals and plants arose from\r\nthese, and that even man himself had come from ape-like mammals. He\r\nheld that the course of development of the earth and of all the\r\ncreatures upon it was a slow and continuous change, uninterrupted by\r\nviolent revolutions. He summed up the causes of organic evolution in\r\nthe following propositions[D]:\r\n\r\n      \"1. Life tends by its inherent forces to increase the volume of\r\n     each living body and of all its parts up to a limit determined by\r\n     its own needs.\r\n\r\n      \"2. New wants in animals give rise to new movements which\r\n     produce organs.\r\n\r\n      \"3. The development of these organs is in proportion to their\r\n     employment.\r\n\r\n      \"4. New developments are transmitted to offspring.\"\r\n\r\nHe supported especially the last two propositions by a series of\r\nexamples as to the effects of use and disuse; and the most famous of\r\nthese, the theory that giraffes had produced their long necks by\r\ncontinually stretching up towards the trees on which they fed, is well\r\nknown to everyone. However, the ingenious speculations of Lamarck were\r\nunsupported by a sufficient range of actual knowledge of anatomy, and\r\nlacked experimental proof. He entirely failed to convince his\r\ncontemporaries; and Darwin himself, in a letter to Lyell, declared\r\nthat he had gained nothing from two readings of Lamarck's book. There\r\ncan be little doubt but that several Continental writers, in\r\nparticular Haeckel, have exaggerated Lamarck's services to the\r\ndevelopment of the idea of evolution. On the other hand, Lyell,\r\nalthough he strongly opposed the ideas of Lamarck and some curious\r\nnotions of progressional creation due to the great Agassiz, had\r\nprepared the way for Darwin by his advocacy of natural causes and slow\r\nchanges in opposition to the catastrophic and miraculous views in\r\nvogue. Above all, Herbert Spencer had argued most strenuously in\r\nfavour of evolution. Thus, in an important passage quoted by Mr. Clodd\r\nfrom the _Leader_ of March 20, 1852, Spencer had written as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Those who cavalierly reject the theory of evolution, as not\r\n     adequately supported by facts, seem quite to forget that their\r\n     own theory is not supported by facts at all. Like the majority of\r\n     men who are born to a given belief, they demand the most rigorous\r\n     proof of any adverse belief, but assume that their own needs\r\n     none. Here we find, scattered over the globe, vegetable and\r\n     animal organisms numbering, of the one kind (according to\r\n     Humboldt) some 320,000 species, and of the other, some 2,000,000\r\n     species (see Carpenter); and if to these we add the numbers of\r\n     animal and vegetable species that have become extinct, we may\r\n     safely estimate the number of species that have existed, and are\r\n     existing, on the earth, at no less than ten millions. Well, which\r\n     is the most rational theory about these ten millions of species?\r\n     Is it most likely that there have been ten millions of special\r\n     creations; or is it most likely that by continual modifications,\r\n     due to change of circumstances, ten millions of varieties have\r\n     been produced, as varieties are being produced still?... Even\r\n     could the supporters of the development hypothesis merely shew\r\n     that the origination of species by the process of modification is\r\n     conceivable, they would be in a better position than their\r\n     opponents. But they can do much more than this. They can shew\r\n     that the process of modification has effected, and is effecting,\r\n     decided changes in all organisms subject to modifying\r\n     influences.... They can shew that in successive generations these\r\n     changes continue, until ultimately the new conditions become the\r\n     natural ones. They can shew that in cultivated plants,\r\n     domesticated animals, and in the several races of men, such\r\n     alterations have taken place. They can show that the degrees of\r\n     difference so produced are often, as in dogs, greater than those\r\n     on which distinctions of species have been founded. They can\r\n     shew, too, that the changes daily taking place in ourselves--the\r\n     facility that attends long practice, and the loss of aptitude\r\n     that begins when practice ceases,--the strengthening of the\r\n     passions habitually gratified, and the weakening of those\r\n     habitually curbed,--the development of every faculty, bodily,\r\n     moral, intellectual, according to the use made of it--are all\r\n     explicable on this principle. And thus they can shew that\r\n     throughout all organic nature there is at work a modifying\r\n     influence of the kind they assign as the cause of these specific\r\n     differences; an influence which, though slow in its action, does,\r\n     in time, if the circumstances demand it, produce marked\r\n     changes--an influence which, to all appearance, would produce in\r\n     the millions of years, and under the great varieties of condition\r\n     which geological records imply, any amount of change.\"\r\n\r\nThese and many other instances which might be brought together from\r\nthe published writings of the half-century before the publication of\r\nthe _Origin_, show conclusively that the idea of evolution was far\r\nfrom new, and that all through the first part of this century\r\ndissatisfaction with the doctrine of the fixity of species and of\r\ntheir miraculous creation was growing. The great contribution of\r\nDarwin was this: First, by his theory of natural selection, he brought\r\ntogether the known facts of variation, of struggle for existence, and\r\nof adaptation to varying conditions, in such a way that they provided\r\nmen with a rational and known cause, a cause the operation of which\r\ncould be seen, for the origin of species by means of preservation of\r\nfavoured races. Next, as to the origin of species, he brought together\r\nnot only proofs of the actual operation of natural selection, but a\r\nbody of evidence in favour of the fact of evolution that was, beyond\r\nall comparison, more striking than had been adduced by any earlier\r\nphilosophical or biological writer. He convinced naturalists that\r\nevolution was by far the most probable way in which the living world\r\nhad come to be what it is, and he made them turn to examination of the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms with a lively hope that the past history\r\nof the living world was not an insoluble problem. Darwin's doctrine\r\nbrought a new life into biological study, and the result of the\r\nincomparably greater bulk of investigation that followed the year 1859\r\nwas a continual increase of evidence in favour of the probability of\r\nevolution, until now the whole scientific world, and the majority of\r\nthose who are unscientific, are content to accept evolution as the\r\nonly reasonable explanation of the living world. It is well to\r\nremember that while Darwin, by bringing forward the theory of struggle\r\nfor existence and resulting survival of the fittest, was the actual\r\ncause of the present assured position of evolution as a first\r\nprinciple of science, it by no means follows that the survival of the\r\nfittest has become similarly a first principle of science. At cross\r\nroads a traveller may choose the right path from a quite\r\nunsatisfactory reason. Darwin himself, in the act of bringing forward\r\nhis own theory of natural selection, admitted the possibility of the\r\nco-operation of many other agencies in evolution, and at various times\r\nduring the course of his life he was inclined to attach, now more now\r\nless, importance to these additional agencies. Huxley, as we shall\r\nsoon come to see, never wavered in his adhesion to the facts of\r\nevolution after 1859; but, from first to last, regarded natural\r\nselection as only the most probable cause of the occurrence of\r\nevolution. Other naturalists, of whom the best-known are Weismann in\r\nGermany, Ray Lankester in England, and W.K. Brooks in America, have\r\ncome to attach a continually increasing importance to the purely\r\nDarwinian factor of natural selection; while others again, such as\r\nHerbert Spencer in England, and the late Professor Cope and a large\r\nAmerican school, have advocated more and more strongly the importance\r\nof what may be called the Lamarckian factors of evolution,--the\r\ninherited effects of increased or diminished use of organs, the direct\r\ninfluence of the environment, and so forth. From the fact that Darwin\r\nhas persuaded the world of the truth of evolution, evolution is often\r\ncalled Darwinism; and in this historically just though scientifically\r\ninaccurate sense of the term, Huxley was a strict Darwinian, a\r\nDarwinian of the Darwinians. From the facts that, although natural\r\nselection had been formulated by several writers before Darwin, and\r\nhad been simultaneously elaborated by Wallace and Darwin, the _Origin\r\nof Species_ was the foundation of the modern acceptation of evolution,\r\nand natural selection was the key-note of the origin of species,\r\nnatural selection may be called Darwinism with both historical and\r\nscientific accuracy; and in this sense of the term Huxley was a\r\nDarwinian; a convinced but free-thinking and broad-minded Darwinian,\r\nwho was far from persuaded that his tenet had a monopoly of truth, and\r\nwho delighted in shewing the distinctions between what seemed to him\r\nprobable and what was proved, and in absorbing from other doctrines\r\nwhatever he thought worthy to be absorbed. The present writer has\r\nthought it so important to distinguish between these two sides of the\r\nword _Darwinism_, that for the sake of clearness he has stated what he\r\nbelieves to be the truth of Huxley's relation to Darwin before\r\nbeginning detailed exposition of it.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of Huxley's position before 1859, the most\r\ninteresting feature of his zoölogical work is the gradual preparation\r\nthat it was making in his mind for the doctrine of the _Origin_. He\r\nwas like an engineer boring a tunnel through a mountain, but ignorant\r\nof how near he was to the pleasant valley on the other side; and,\r\nabove all, ignorant how rapidly he was being met by a much more mighty\r\nexcavation from the other side. To use what is perhaps a more exact\r\nsimile: he was like a child with half the pieces of a puzzle-map,\r\nslowly linking them together as far as they would fit, and quite\r\nignorant that presently the remaining half would suddenly be given\r\nhim, and with almost no trouble would at once fit into the gaps he had\r\nnecessarily left, and transform a meaningless pattern into a perfect\r\nand intelligible whole. Let us consider some of these map pieces. The\r\nultimate picture was the conception of the whole world of life, past\r\nand present, as a single family tree growing up from the simplest\r\npossible roots, and gradually spreading out first into the two main\r\nbranches of animals and plants, and then into the endless series of\r\ncomplicated ramifications that make up living and extinct animals and\r\nplants. Huxley was piecing together the scattered fragments, and\r\ngradually learning to see here and there whole branches, as yet\r\nseparate at their lower ends, but in themselves shapely, and showing a\r\ngeneral resemblance to one another in the gradual progression from\r\nsimple to complex. The greatest of these branches that he had pieced\r\ntogether was the group of Medusæ and their allies, now known as\r\nCoelenterates. He had formed similar branches for the Molluscs and\r\nminor branches for the Salps and Ascidians, and, in his general\r\nlectures on the whole animal kingdom, he had shadowed out the broad\r\narrangement of the main divisions, or, as he called them, _types_. He\r\nhad seen in each particular branch the clearest evidence of the laws\r\nof growth which had directed its development, and had realised that\r\nthese laws of growth, consisting of gradual modifications of common\r\ntypical structures, were identical in the different branches. He had\r\ntaken clear hold of Von Baer's conception that the younger stages of\r\ndifferent types were more alike than the adult stages, and here and\r\nthere he had made comparisons between the younger stages or simplest\r\nforms of his different branches, and had shown that, without\r\ncompletely realising it, he was ready for the idea that just as the\r\nseparate pieces could be arranged to form orderly branches, so the\r\nseparate branches might come to be arranged as a single tree. And\r\nfinally, in his lectures on \"Protoplasm and Cells,\" and on the\r\n\"Common Structure of the Animal and Plant Kingdoms,\" he had reached\r\nthe conclusion that the two main divisions of the living world were\r\nformed of the same stuff, displayed in identical fashion the\r\nelementary functions of life, and were creatures of the same order.\r\nBut, notwithstanding this close approach to modern conceptions, he was\r\nnot an evolutionist. When, in public, he expressed deliberate\r\nconvictions, these convictions were against the general idea of\r\nevolution, until very shortly before 1859. In this opposition he was\r\nsupported partly by the critical scepticism of his mind, which in all\r\nthings made him singularly unwilling to accept any theories of any\r\nkind, but chiefly from the fact that the books of the two chief\r\nsupporters of evolutionary conceptions impressed him very\r\nunfavourably. Huxley writes:\r\n\r\n     \"I had studied Lamarck attentively, and I had read the _Vestiges_\r\n     with due care; but neither of them afforded me any good ground\r\n     for changing my negative and critical attitude. As for the\r\n     _Vestiges_, I confess that the book simply irritated me by the\r\n     prodigious ignorance and thoroughly unscientific habit of mind\r\n     manifested by the writer. If it had any influence on me at all,\r\n     it set me against evolution; and the only review I ever have\r\n     qualms of conscience about, on the ground of needless savagery is\r\n     one I wrote on the _Vestiges_ while under that influence. With\r\n     respect to the _Philosophie Zoologique_, it is no reproach to\r\n     Lamarck to say that the discussion of the species question in\r\n     that work, whatever might be said for it in 1809, was miserably\r\n     below the level of the knowledge of half a century later. In that\r\n     interval of time, the elucidation of the structure of the lower\r\n     animals and plants had given rise to wholly new conceptions of\r\n     their relations; histology and embryology, in the modern sense,\r\n     had been created; physiology had been reconstituted; the facts of\r\n     distribution, geological and geographical, had been prodigiously\r\n     multiplied and reduced to order. To any biologist whose studies\r\n     had carried him beyond mere species-mongering, in 1850 one-half\r\n     of Lamarck's arguments were obsolete, and the other half\r\n     erroneous or defective, in virtue of omitting to deal with the\r\n     various classes of evidence which had been brought to light since\r\n     his time. Moreover his one suggestion as to the cause of the\r\n     gradual modification of species--effort excited by change of\r\n     conditions--was, on the face of it, inapplicable to the whole\r\n     vegetable world. I do not think that any impartial judge who\r\n     reads the _Philosophie Zoologique_ now, and who afterwards takes\r\n     up Lyell's trenchant and effective criticism (published as far\r\n     back as 1830) will be disposed to allot to Lamarck a much higher\r\n     place in the establishment of biological evolution than that\r\n     which Bacon assigns to himself in relation to physical science\r\n     generally--_buccinator tantum_\".\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Huxley's friendship with Darwin and with Lyell\r\nbegan to make him less certain about the fixity of species. He tells\r\nus that during his first interview with Darwin, which occurred soon\r\nafter his return from the _Rattlesnake_, he\r\n\r\n     \"expressed his belief in the sharpness of the lines of\r\n     demarcation between natural groups and in the absence of\r\n     transitional forms, with all the confidence of youth and\r\n     imperfect knowledge. I was not aware at that time that he had\r\n     been many years brooding over the species question; and the\r\n     humorous smile which accompanied his gentle answer, that such was\r\n     not altogether his view, long haunted and puzzled me.\"\r\n\r\nAn elaborate study of Lyell's works helped largely in destroying this\r\nyouthful confidence, and a letter written by Lyell and quoted by\r\nHuxley in the chapter he communicated to Darwin's _Life and Letters_,\r\nstates that in April, 1856, \"when Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were\r\nat Darwin's last week they (all four of them) ran a tilt against\r\nspecies; further I believe, than they are prepared to go.\" Another\r\nquotation from Huxley's essay on _The Reception of the Origin of\r\nSpecies_ will make it plain beyond all doubt that he was not a\r\nDarwinian before Darwin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOSEPH DALTON HOOKER]\r\n\r\n     \"Thus, looking hack into the past, it seems to me that my own\r\n     position of critical expectancy was just and reasonable, and must\r\n     have been taken up, on the same grounds, by many other persons.\r\n     If Agassiz had told me that the forms of life which had\r\n     successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of\r\n     successive thoughts of the Deity; and that He had wiped out one\r\n     set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe\r\n     as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself\r\n     not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the\r\n     facts of palæontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was\r\n     founded, but I had to confess my want of means of testing the\r\n     correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could\r\n     by no means see what the explanation explained. Neither did it\r\n     help me to be told by an eminent anatomist that species had\r\n     succeeded one another in time, in virtue of a 'continuously\r\n     operative creational law'. That seemed to me to be no more than\r\n     saying that species had succeeded one another in the form of a\r\n     vote-catching resolution, with 'law' to please the man of science\r\n     and 'creational' to draw the orthodox. So I took refuge in that\r\n     _thätige Skepsis_ which Goethe has so well defined; and,\r\n     reversing the apostolic precept to be all things to all men, I\r\n     usually defended the tenability of the received doctrines when I\r\n     had to do with the transmutationists, and stood up for the\r\n     possibility of transmutation among the orthodox--thereby, no\r\n     doubt, increasing an already current, but quite undeserved,\r\n     reputation for needless combativeness.\"\r\n\r\nWhat transformed Huxley's views and the views of his contemporaries\r\nwho accepted Darwinism was not so much the evidence in favour of\r\nevolution contained in the _Origin_, as the illuminating doctrine of\r\nnatural selection which for the first time supplied naturalists with a\r\nreasonable explanation of how evolution might have come about, both in\r\nthe animal and vegetable kingdoms. As soon as this reason was\r\nprovided them, they turned to the store of facts within their own\r\nknowledge, and rapidly arranged the evidence which had been lurking\r\nonly partly visible in favour of the fact of evolution. It cannot be\r\ndisputed that here and there earlier writers than Darwin and Wallace\r\nhad suggested the possibility of natural selection acting upon\r\nexisting variations so as to cause survival of the fittest.\r\nMacGillivray, the Scots naturalist, and the father of Huxley's\r\ncompanion on the _Rattlesnake_, had published suggestions which came\r\nexceedingly near to Darwin's theory. In 1831 Mr. Patrick Matthew had\r\npublished a work on _Naval Architecture and Timber_, and in it had\r\nstated the essential principle of the Darwinian doctrine of struggle\r\nand survival. Still earlier, in 1813, a Dr. W.C. Wells, in a paper to\r\nthe Royal Society on \"A White Female, Part of whose Skin Resembles\r\nthat of a Negro,\" had, as Darwin himself freely admitted, distinctly\r\nrecognised the principle of natural selection--but applied it only to\r\nthe races of man, and to certain characters alone. Finally, long\r\nbefore either of these, Aristotle himself had written, in _Physics_,\r\nii., 8: \"Why are not the things which seem the result of design,\r\nmerely spontaneous variations, which, being useful, have been\r\npreserved, while others are continually eliminated as unsuitable?\"\r\nNone of these foreshadowings were supported by lengthy evidence, nor\r\nworked out into an elaborate theory; and it was not until Darwin had\r\ndone this that we can say the birth of natural selection really took\r\nplace. Huxley writes:\r\n\r\n     \"The suggestion that new species may result from the selective\r\n     action of external conditions upon the variations from their\r\n     specific type which individuals present,--and which we call\r\n     'spontaneous,' because we are ignorant of their causation,--is\r\n     as wholly unknown to the historian of scientific ideas as it was\r\n     to biological specialists before 1858.\"\r\n\r\nBut that suggestion is the central idea of the origin of species, and\r\ncontains the quintessence of Darwinism.\r\n\r\nSome weeks before the _Origin_ was published, Darwin wrote to Huxley,\r\nsending him a copy of the work, and asking him for the names of\r\neminent foreigners to whom it should be sent. In the course of his\r\nletter he wrote: \"I shall be intensely curious to hear what effect the\r\nbook produces on you,\" and it was clear that he had no very confident\r\nexpectation of a favourable opinion. Huxley replied the day before the\r\n_Origin_ was published, saying that he had finished the volume, and\r\nstating that it had completely convinced him of the fact of evolution,\r\nand that he fully accepted natural selection as a \"true cause for the\r\nproduction of species.\" Darwin, in a letter to Wallace, telling of his\r\ndoubts and fears concerning the reception of his book, had added the\r\npostscript: \"I think I told you before that Hooker is a complete\r\nconvert. If I can convert Huxley, I shall be content.\" When he\r\nreceived Huxley's letter he replied at once:\r\n\r\n     \"Like a good Catholic who has received extreme unction, I can now\r\n     sing _Nunc Dimittis_. I should have been more than contented with\r\n     one quarter of what you have said. Exactly fifteen months ago,\r\n     when I first put pen to paper for this volume, I had awful\r\n     misgivings, and thought perhaps I had deluded myself, like so\r\n     many have done; and I then fixed in my mind three judges, on\r\n     whose decision I determined mentally to abide. The judges were\r\n     Lyell, Hooker, and yourself. It was this which made me so\r\n     excessively anxious for your verdict. I am now contented, and can\r\n     sing my _Nunc Dimittis_.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the new theory on Huxley's mind has been expressed most\r\nfully and clearly by himself:\r\n\r\n     \"I imagine that most of my contemporaries who thought seriously\r\n     about the matter were very much in my own state of mind--inclined\r\n     to say to Mosaists and Evolutionists, 'a plague on both your\r\n     houses!' and disposed to turn aside from an interminable and\r\n     apparently fruitless discussion to labour in the fertile fields\r\n     of ascertainable fact. And I may, therefore, further suppose that\r\n     the publication of the Darwin and Wallace papers in 1858, and\r\n     still more that of the _Origin_ in 1859, had the effect upon them\r\n     of that of a flash of light which, to a man who has lost himself\r\n     in a dark night, suddenly reveals a road which, whether it takes\r\n     him straight home or not, certainly goes his way. That which we\r\n     were looking for and could not find, was a hypothesis respecting\r\n     the origin of known organic forms, which assumed the operation of\r\n     no causes but such as could be proved to be actually at work. We\r\n     wanted, not to pin our faith to that or any other speculation,\r\n     but to get hold of clear and definite conceptions which could be\r\n     brought face to face with facts and have their validity tested.\r\n     The _Origin_ provided us with the working hypothesis we sought.\r\n     Moreover, it did us the immense service of freeing us for ever\r\n     from the dilemma--refuse to accept the creation hypothesis, and\r\n     what have you to propose that can be accepted by any cautious\r\n     reasoner? In 1857 I had no answer ready, and I do not think that\r\n     anyone else had. A year later, we reproached ourselves with\r\n     dulness for being perplexed by such an enquiry. My reflection,\r\n     when I first made myself master of the central idea of the\r\n     _Origin_ was, 'how exceedingly stupid not to have thought of\r\n     that.' I suppose that Columbus's companions said much the same\r\n     when he made the egg to stand on end. The facts of variability,\r\n     of the struggle for existence, of adaptation to conditions, were\r\n     notorious enough; but none of us had suspected that the road to\r\n     the heart of the species problem lay through them, until Darwin\r\n     and Wallace dispelled the darkness, and the beacon-fire of the\r\n     _Origin_ guided the benighted.\r\n\r\n      \"Whether the particular shape which the doctrine of evolution,\r\n     as applied to the organic world, took in Darwin's hands, would\r\n     prove to be final or not, was, to me, a matter of indifference.\r\n     In my earliest criticisms of the _Origin_ I ventured to point out\r\n     that its logical foundation was insecure so long as experiments\r\n     in selective breeding had not produced varieties which were more\r\n     or less infertile; and that insecurity remains up to the present\r\n     time. But, with any and every critical doubt which my sceptical\r\n     ingenuity could suggest, the Darwinian hypothesis remained\r\n     incomparably more probable than the creation hypothesis. And if\r\n     we had none of us been able to discern the paramount significance\r\n     of some of the most patent and notorious of natural facts, until\r\n     they were, so to speak, thrust under our noses, what force\r\n     remained in the dilemma--creation or nothing? It was obvious\r\n     that, hereafter, the probability would be immensely greater that\r\n     the links of natural causation were hidden from our purblind\r\n     eyes, than that natural causation should be unable to produce all\r\n     the phenomena of nature. The only rational course for those who\r\n     had no other object than the attainment of truth, was to accept\r\n     'Darwinism' as a working hypothesis, and see what could be made\r\n     of it. Either it would prove its capacity to elucidate the fact\r\n     of organic life, or it would break down under the strain. This\r\n     was surely the dictate of common sense, and for once common-sense\r\n     carried the day. The result has been that complete _volte-face_\r\n     of the whole scientific world which must seem so surprising to\r\n     the present generation. I do not mean to say that all the leaders\r\n     of biological science have avowed themselves Darwinians; but I do\r\n     not think that there is a single zoölogist, or botanist, or\r\n     palæontologist, among the multitude of active workers of this\r\n     generation, who is other than an evolutionist profoundly\r\n     influenced by Darwin's views. Whatever may be the ultimate fate\r\n     of the particular theory put forth by Darwin, I venture to affirm\r\n     that, so far as my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity and all the\r\n     learning of hostile critics has not enabled them to adduce a\r\n     solitary fact of which it can be said that it is irreconcilable\r\n     with the Darwinian theory. In the prodigious variety and\r\n     complexity of organic nature, there are multitudes of phenomena\r\n     which are not deducible from any generalisation we have yet\r\n     reached. But the same may be said of every other class of natural\r\n     objects. I believe that astronomers cannot yet get the moon's\r\n     motions into perfect accordance with the theory of gravitation.\"\r\n\r\nThese quotations make plain the historical fact that Huxley was\r\nconvinced of evolution because Darwin, by his theory of natural\r\nselection, brought forward an actual cause that could be seen in\r\noperation, and that was competent to produce new species. As soon as the\r\n\"flash of light\" came, it revealed to Huxley the vast store of evidence\r\nthat he had unconsciously accumulated, and it set him at once to work\r\ncollecting more evidence. If we bear in mind the distinction between\r\nevolution and natural selection, the well-known subsequent history of\r\nthe relations between Huxley and what was known popularly as Darwinism\r\nbecomes clear and intelligible. From first to last he accepted\r\nevolution; from first to last he accepted natural selection as by far\r\nthe most reasonable hypothesis that had been brought forward, and as\r\ninfinitely more in accordance with the observed facts of nature than any\r\ntheory of the immediate action of supernatural creative power. As time\r\nwent on, and the influence of Darwin's theory made evolution acceptable\r\nto a wider and wider range of people, until it passed into the common\r\nknowledge of the world, that confusion of which we have spoken arose\r\nbetween evolution and Darwin's particular theory. And as knowledge grew,\r\nand the number of biologists increased in the striking fashion of this\r\nlast half-century, while the evidence for evolution continued to\r\nincrease with an unexpected rapidity, every detail of the purely\r\nDarwinian theory became more and more subjected to rigid scrutiny. Most\r\neducated people, unless their education has been largely in an\r\nexperimental science, find difficulty in understanding the relation in\r\nthe minds of naturalists between \"authority\" and \"knowledge.\" We do not\r\n_know_, for instance, that the structure of the Medusæ consists\r\nessentially of two foundation-membranes, because Huxley, one of the\r\ngreatest authorities in anatomy that the world has seen, told us that it\r\nwas so. We know it because, Huxley having told us that it was so, we are\r\nable at any time with a microscope and dissecting needles to observe the\r\nfact for ourselves. It is true, that unless we are making a special\r\nstudy of the Medusæ we do not repeat the observation in the case of so\r\nmany different forms of Medusæ as Huxley studied; but it is part of our\r\ntraining to observe for ourselves in a sufficient number of cases to\r\ntest the correspondence between statement and fact before we accept the\r\ngeneralisation of any authority. And we learn, or at least have the\r\nopportunity of learning, in the whole habit of our lives as naturalists,\r\nto distinguish carefully between knowledge of which personal observation\r\nis an essential part, and opinion or belief which may or may not be\r\nbased upon authority, but which in any case is devoid of the\r\ncorroboration of personal observation. When a piece of new anatomical or\r\nphysiological work is published in a technical journal, it is read by a\r\nlarge number of anatomists and physiologists, and if the work is\r\napparently of an important kind, bearing on the general problems that\r\neven specialists have to follow, they all at once set to work in their\r\nlaboratories to make corroborative dissections or experiments, and it is\r\npart of every modern account of a biological discovery to tell exactly\r\nthe methods by which results were got, in order that this process of\r\ncorroboration may be set about easily. The question as to whether or no\r\nnatural selection were the sole or chief cause, or indeed a cause at\r\nall, of evolution is not yet, and perhaps never will be, a matter of\r\nknowledge in the scientific sense. At the most, we can see for ourselves\r\nonly that selection does bring about changes at least as great as the\r\ndifferences between natural species. The evidence for this we have\r\nbefore our eyes, if we choose to see, on a stock farm; in the breeding\r\nyards of any keeper of \"fancy\" animals; or in the nursery gardens of any\r\nflorist. So far, Huxley accepted the Darwinian principle as a definite\r\ncontribution to knowledge; and so far the whole body of biologists has\r\nfollowed him. Beyond this the truth of the Darwinian principle is a\r\nmatter of inference or judgment; of balancing probabilities and\r\nimprobabilities. In multitude of counsellors there is said to be wisdom,\r\nand what we learn from the counsellors of biology all over the world is\r\nthat some maintain that natural selection is the only probable agency in\r\neffecting evolution, and that it is competent to account for all the\r\nchanges which we know to have taken place; others hold that its probable\r\ninfluence has been over-rated; and others, again, think that it has been\r\none of the many causes that have brought about the kaleidoscopic variety\r\nof organic nature. Huxley remained to the last among those who\r\ndistinguished in the clearest way between natural selection as an\r\nexceedingly ingenious and probable hypothesis, and a proved cause; and\r\nhe was always careful, especially when he was writing for or speaking in\r\nthe presence of those who like himself accepted the fact of evolution as\r\nproven, to distinguish between this provisional hypothesis as to how\r\nevolution had come about, and definite knowledge that it had come about\r\nin this way. Two passages from Huxley's writings, one written in 1860 in\r\nthe _Westminster Review_, and the second written in 1893, in the preface\r\nto the volume of his collected essays which contained a reprint of the\r\n_Westminster_ article, will make plain the continuity of Huxley's\r\nattitude:\r\n\r\n     \"There is no fault to be found with Mr. Darwin's method, then;\r\n     but it is another question whether he has fulfilled all the\r\n     conditions imposed by that method. Is it satisfactorily proved,\r\n     in fact, that species may be originated by selection? That there\r\n     is such a thing as natural selection? That none of the phenomena\r\n     exhibited by species are inconsistent with the origin of species\r\n     in this way? If these questions can be answered in the\r\n     affirmative, Mr. Darwin's view steps out of the rank of\r\n     hypotheses into those of proved theories; but, so long as the\r\n     evidence at present adduced falls short of enforcing that\r\n     affirmation, so long, to our minds, must the new doctrine be\r\n     content to remain among the former--an extremely valuable, and in\r\n     the highest degree probable, doctrine; indeed, the only extant\r\n     hypothesis which is worth anything in a scientific point of view;\r\n     but still a hypothesis, and not yet the theory of species.\r\n\r\n      \"After much consideration, and assuredly with no bias against\r\n     Mr. Darwin's views, it is our clear conviction that, as the\r\n     evidence stands, it is not absolutely proven that a group of\r\n     animals having all the characters exhibited by species in nature,\r\n     has ever been originated by selection, whether natural or\r\n     artificial. Groups having the morphological character of species,\r\n     distinct and permanent races, in fact, have been so produced over\r\n     and over again; but there is no positive evidence at present that\r\n     any group of animals has, by variation and selective breeding,\r\n     given rise to another group which was in the least degree\r\n     infertile with the first. Mr. Darwin is perfectly aware of this\r\n     weak point, and brings forward a multitude of ingenious and\r\n     important arguments to diminish the force of the objection. We\r\n     admit the value of these arguments to the fullest extent; nay, we\r\n     will go so far as to express our belief that experiments,\r\n     conducted by a skilful physiologist, would very probably obtain\r\n     the desired production of mutually more or less infertile breeds\r\n     from a common stock in a comparatively few years; but still, as\r\n     the case stands at present, this little 'rift within the lute' is\r\n     not to be disguised or overlooked.\"--(_Westminster Review_,\r\n     1860.)\r\n\r\n      \"We should leave a very wrong impression on the reader's mind if\r\n     we permitted him to suppose that the value of Darwin's work\r\n     depends wholly on the ultimate justification of the theoretical\r\n     views which it contains. On the contrary, if they were disproved\r\n     to-morrow, the book would still be the best of its kind--the most\r\n     compendious statement of well-sifted facts bearing on the\r\n     doctrine of species that has ever appeared. The chapters on\r\n     variation, on the struggle for existence, on instinct, on\r\n     hybridism, on the imperfection of the geological record, on\r\n     geographical distribution, have not only no equals, but, so far\r\n     as our knowledge goes, no competitors, within the range of\r\n     biological literature. And viewed as a whole, we do not believe\r\n     that, since the publication of Von Baer's _Researches on\r\n     Development_, thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated\r\n     to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of\r\n     biology, but in extending the domination of science over regions\r\n     of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly\r\n     penetrated.\"--(_Ibid._)\r\n\r\n      \"Those who take the trouble to read the essays published in 1859\r\n     and 1860, will, I think, do me the justice to admit that my zeal\r\n     to secure fair play for Mr. Darwin did not drive me into the\r\n     position of a mere advocate; and that, while doing justice to the\r\n     greatness of the argument, I did not fail to indicate its weak\r\n     points. I have never seen any reason for departing from the\r\n     position which I took up in these two essays; and the assertion\r\n     which I sometimes meet with nowadays that I have 'recanted' or\r\n     changed my opinions about Mr. Darwin's views is quite\r\n     unintelligible to me.\r\n\r\n      \"As I have said in the seventh essay, the fact of evolution is\r\n     to my mind sufficiently evidenced by palæontology; and I remain\r\n     of the opinion expressed in the second, that until selective\r\n     breeding is definitely proved to give rise to varieties infertile\r\n     with one another, the logical foundation of the theory of natural\r\n     selection is quite incomplete. We still remain very much in the\r\n     dark about the causes of variation; the apparent inheritance of\r\n     acquired characters in some cases; and the struggle for existence\r\n     within the organism, which probably lies at the bottom of both\r\n     these phenomena.\"--(1893, _Preface_.)\r\n\r\nFinally, when he was awarded the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society, on\r\nNovember 30, 1894, in the course of an address at the anniversary\r\ndinner of the Society, he said, as reported in the _Times_ next day:\r\n\r\n     \"I am as much convinced now as I was thirty-four years ago that\r\n     the theory propounded by Mr. Darwin, I mean that which he\r\n     propounded--not that which has been reported to be his by too\r\n     many ill-instructed, both friends and foes--has never yet been\r\n     shewn to be inconsistent with any positive observations, and if I\r\n     may use a phrase which I know has been objected to, and which I\r\n     use in a totally different sense from that in which it was first\r\n     proposed by its first propounder, I do believe that on all\r\n     grounds of pure science it 'holds the field' as the only\r\n     hypothesis at present before us which has a sound scientific\r\n     foundation.... I am sincerely of opinion that the views which\r\n     were propounded by Mr. Darwin thirty-four years ago may be\r\n     understood hereafter as constituting an epoch in the intellectual\r\n     history of the human race. They will modify the whole system of\r\n     our thought and opinion, our most intimate convictions. But I do\r\n     not know, I do not think anybody knows, whether the particular\r\n     views he held will be hereafter fortified by the experience of\r\n     the ages which come after us.... Whether the particular form in\r\n     which he has put before us the Darwinian doctrines may be such as\r\n     to be destined to survive or not, is more, I venture to think,\r\n     than anybody is capable at this present moment of saying.\"\r\n\r\nFurther details of Huxley's relation to natural selection may be\r\ngained from an interesting chapter in Professor Poulton's volume on\r\n_Charles Darwin_ (Cassell and Co., London, 1896).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: See E.

Depend upon it,\r\n     you have earned the lasting gratitude of all thoughtful men; and\r\n     as to the curs which will bark and yelp, you must recollect that\r\n     some of your friends, at any rate, are endowed with an amount of\r\n     combativeness which (though you have often and justly rebuked it)\r\n     may stand you in good stead.\r\n\r\n      \"I am sharpening my claws and beak in readiness.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley was absolutely right in his prediction as to the magnitude of\r\nthe prejudices to be overcome before evolution became accepted, and\r\nfor the next thirty years of his life he was the leader in the battle\r\nfor Darwinism. It was natural that the new views, especially in their\r\nextension to man himself, should arouse the keenest opposition. To\r\nthose of the present generation, who have grown up in an atmosphere\r\nimpregnated by the doctrine of descent, the position of the world in\r\n1860 seems \"older than a tale written in any book.\" As we have tried\r\nto shew in the preceding chapter, biological science was partially\r\nprepared; the mutability of species and the orderly succession of\r\norganic life were in the air. But the application of the doctrine to\r\nman came as a greater shock to civilised sentiment than would have\r\noccurred a century earlier. It came as a disaster even to the clearest\r\nand calmest intellects, for it seemed to drag down to the dirt the\r\nnobility of man. Out of the fierce flame of the French Revolution,\r\nthere had come purged and clean the conception of man as an individual\r\nand soul. As this century advanced, the conception of the dignity and\r\nworth of each individual man, rich or poor, bond or free, had spread\r\nmore and more widely, bearing as its fruit the emancipation of slaves,\r\nthe spread of political freedom, the amelioration of the conditions of\r\nthe dregs of humanity, the right of all to education, the possibility\r\nof universal peace based on the brotherhood of man; and all that was\r\nbest in philosophy and in political practice seemed bound up with a\r\nlofty view of the unit of mankind. Carlyle himself, to whom many of\r\nthe freest and noblest spirits in Europe were beginning to look as to\r\nan inspired prophet, could see in it nothing but a \"monkey\r\ndamnification of mankind.\" The dogmatic world saw in it nothing but a\r\ndeliberate and malicious assault upon religion. The Church of England\r\nin particular was beginning to recover from a long period of almost\r\nincredible supineness, and there was arising a large body of clergy\r\nfull of faith and zeal and good works, but quite unacquainted with\r\nscience, who frankly regarded Darwin as Antichrist, and Huxley and\r\nTyndall as emissaries of the devil. Against evolutionists there was\r\nleft unused no weapon that ignorant prejudice could find, whether that\r\nprejudice was inspired by a lofty zeal for what it conceived to be the\r\nhighest interests of humanity, or by a crafty policy which saw in the\r\nnew doctrine a blow to the coming renewed supremacy of the Church. To\r\nus, now, it may seem that Huxley had \"sharpened his beak and claws\"\r\nwith the spirit of a gladiator rather than with that of the mere\r\ndefender of a scientific doctrine; but a very short study of\r\ncontemporary literature will convince anyone that for a time the\r\ndefenders of evolution had to defend not only what they knew to be\r\nscientific truth, but their personal and private reputation. The new\r\ndoctrine, like perhaps all the great doctrines that have come into the\r\nworld, brought not peace but a sword, and had to be defended by the\r\nsword. Darwin had not the kind of disposition nor the particular\r\nfaculties necessary for a deadly contest of this kind; he was\r\ninterested indeed above all things in convincing a few leading\r\nnaturalists of the truth of his opinions; but, that done, he would\r\nhave been contented to continue his own work quietly, in absolute\r\ncarelessness as to what the world in general thought of him. Huxley,\r\non the other hand, was incapable of restraining himself from\r\npropagating what he knew to be the truth; his reforming missionary\r\nspirit was not content simply with self-defence; it drove him to be a\r\nbishop _in partibus infidelium_.\r\n\r\nBy a curious and interesting accident, Huxley had the opportunity of\r\nbeginning his propagandism by writing the first great review of _The\r\nOrigin of Species_ in the _Times_, at that period without question the\r\nleading journal in the world. Huxley's own account of this happy\r\nchance is given in _Darwin's Life and Letters_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n     \"The _Origin_ was sent to Mr. Lucas, one of the staff of the\r\n     _Times_ writers at that day, in what I suppose was the ordinary\r\n     course of business. Mr. Lucas, though an excellent journalist,\r\n     and at a later period editor of _Once a Week_, was as innocent of\r\n     any knowledge of science as a babe, and bewailed himself to an\r\n     acquaintance on having to deal with such a book, whereupon he was\r\n     recommended to ask me to get him out of his difficulty, and he\r\n     applied to me accordingly, explaining, however, that it would be\r\n     necessary for him formally to adopt anything I might be disposed\r\n     to write, by prefacing it with two or three paragraphs of his\r\n     own.\r\n\r\n      \"I was too anxious to seize on the opportunity thus offered of\r\n     giving the book a fair chance with the multitudinous readers of\r\n     the _Times_ to make any difficulty about conditions; and being\r\n     then very full of the subject, I wrote the article faster, I\r\n     think, than I ever wrote anything in my life, and sent it to Mr.\r\n     Lucas, who duly prefixed his opening sentences. When the article\r\n     appeared, there was much speculation as to its authorship. The\r\n     secret leaked out in time, as all secrets will, but not by my\r\n     aid; and then I used to derive a good deal of innocent amusement\r\n     from the vehement assertions of some of my more acute friends,\r\n     that they knew it was mine from the first paragraph.\" \"As the\r\n     _Times_ some years since referred to my connection with the\r\n     review, I suppose there will be no breach of confidence in the\r\n     publication of this little history.\"\r\n\r\nThis review was one of the few favourable notices, and naturally it\r\ndelighted Darwin greatly. He wrote to Hooker about it: \"Have you seen\r\nthe splendid essay and notice of my book in the _Times_? I cannot\r\navoid a strong suspicion that it is by Huxley; but I have never heard\r\nthat he wrote in the _Times_. It will do grand service.\" On the same\r\nday, writing to Huxley himself, he said of the review:\r\n\r\n     \"It included an eulogium of me which quite touched me, although I\r\n     am not vain enough to think it all deserved. The author is a\r\n     literary man and a German scholar. He has read my book\r\n     attentively; but, what is very remarkable, it seems that he is a\r\n     profound naturalist. He knows my barnacle book and appreciates it\r\n     too highly. Lastly, he writes and thinks with quite uncommon\r\n     force and clearness; and, what is even still rarer, his writing\r\n     is seasoned with most pleasant wit. We all laughed heartily over\r\n     some of the sentences.... Who can it be? Certainly I should have\r\n     said that there was only one man in England who could have\r\n     written this essay, and that you were the man; but I suppose that\r\n     I am wrong, and that there is some hidden genius of great\r\n     calibre; for how could you influence Jupiter Olympus and make him\r\n     give you three and a half columns to pure science? The old fogies\r\n     will think the world will come to an end. Well, whoever the man\r\n     is, he has done great service to the cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe essay in the _Times_ was followed shortly afterwards by a \"Friday\r\nEvening Discourse\" in 1860 on \"Species, Races, and their Origin,\" in\r\nwhich Huxley, addressing a cultivated audience, laid the whole weight\r\nof his brilliant scientific reputation on the side of evolution. Next,\r\nin April, 1860, he published a long article in the _Westminster\r\nReview_, then a leading organ of advanced opinion, on _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_, some quotations from which article were made in the last\r\nchapter. Apart from its strong support of the doctrine of evolution,\r\nits whole-hearted praise of Darwin's achievements, and the clear way\r\nin which, while it showed the value of natural selection as the only\r\nsatisfactory hypothesis in the field, it gave reasons for regarding it\r\nstrictly as an hypothesis, the review is specially interesting as a\r\ncontrast to reviews which appeared about the same time in the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ and in the _Quarterly_. Both these were not only\r\nexceedingly unfavourable, but were written in a spirit of personal\r\nabuse singularly unworthy of their authors and still more of their\r\nsubject. The review in the _Edinburgh_ had come as a particularly\r\ngreat shock to Darwin, Huxley, and their friends. Sir Richard Owen, in\r\nmany ways, was at that time the most distinguished anatomist in\r\nEngland. He had been an ardent follower of Cuvier, and in England had\r\ncarried on the palæontological work of the great Frenchman. He was a\r\npersonal friend of the court, a well-known man in the best society,\r\nand in many ways a worthy upholder of the best traditions of science.\r\nIn the particular matter of species, he was known to be by no means a\r\nfirm supporter of the orthodox views. When Darwin's paper was read at\r\nthe Linnæan Society, and afterwards when the _Origin_ was published,\r\nthe verdict of Owen was looked to with the greatest interest by the\r\ngeneral public. For a time he wavered, and even expressed himself of\r\nthe opinion that he had already in his published works included a\r\nconsiderable portion of Darwin's views. But two things seemed to have\r\ninfluenced him: First, Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, and Sedgwick\r\nand Whewell, the two best-known men at Cambridge, urged him to stamp\r\nonce for all, as he only could do, upon this \"new and pernicious\r\ndoctrine.\" Secondly, combined with his great abilities, he had the\r\nkeenest personal interest in his own position as the leader of English\r\nscience, and had no particular friendship for men or for views that\r\nseemed likely to threaten his own supreme position. In a very short\r\ntime he changed from being neutral, with a tendency in favour of the\r\nnew views, to being a bitter opponent of them. In scientific societies\r\nand in London generally, naturally enough he constantly came across\r\nthe younger scientific men, such as Huxley and Hooker, who had\r\ndeclared for Darwin, and he made the irretrievable mistake of for a\r\ntime attempting to disguise his opposition while he was writing the\r\nmost bitter of all the articles against Darwinism. That appeared in\r\nthe _Edinburgh Review_ in April, 1860, and the range of knowledge it\r\ndisplayed, and the form of arguments employed, naturally enough\r\nbetrayed the secret of its authorship, although Owen for very long\r\nattempted to conceal his connection with it. Darwin, who had the most\r\nunusual generosity towards his opponents, found this review too much\r\nfor him. Writing to Lyell soon after its publication, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"I have just read the _Edinburgh_, which, without doubt is by\r\n     ----. It is extremely malignant, clever, and, I fear, will be\r\n     very damaging. He is atrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, and\r\n     very bitter against Hooker. So we three _enjoyed_ it together.\r\n     Not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me uncomfortable for\r\n     one night; but I have quite got over it to-day. It requires much\r\n     study to appreciate all the bitter spite of many of the remarks\r\n     against me; indeed I did not discover all myself. It scandalously\r\n     misrepresents many parts. He misquotes some passages, altering\r\n     words within inverted commas.... It is painful to be hated in the\r\n     intense degree with which ---- hates me.\"\r\n\r\nAs Owen was still alive when this letter was published in _Darwin's\r\nLife_, the authorship of the review was not actually mentioned; but it\r\nis necessary to mention it, as it justifies the sternness with which\r\nHuxley exposed Owen on an occasion shortly to be described. The review\r\nin the _Quarterly_ was written by Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford,\r\nin July, 1860, and almost at once the authorship of it became known\r\nto Darwin's friends. In connection with this, Huxley wrote in 1887, in\r\n_Darwin's Life and Letters_:\r\n\r\n     \"I doubt if there was any man then living who had a better right\r\n     (than Darwin) to expect that anything he might choose to say on\r\n     such a question as the Origin of Species would be listened to\r\n     with profound attention, and discussed with respect. And there\r\n     was certainly no man whose personal character should have\r\n     afforded a better safeguard against attacks, instinct with\r\n     malignity and spiced with shameless impertinences. Yet such was\r\n     the portion of one of the kindest and truest men that it was ever\r\n     my good fortune to know; and years had to pass away before\r\n     misrepresentation, ridicule, and denunciation ceased to be the\r\n     most notable constituents of the majority of the multitudinous\r\n     criticisms of his work which poured from the press. I am loth to\r\n     rake up any of these ancient scandals from their well-deserved\r\n     oblivion; but I must make good a statement which may seem\r\n     overcharged to the present generation, and there is no _pièce\r\n     justificative_ more apt for the purpose or more worthy of such\r\n     dishonour than the article in the _Quarterly Review_ for July,\r\n     1860. Since Lord Brougham assailed Dr. Young, the world has seen\r\n     no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a\r\n     Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which one of\r\n     the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most\r\n     candid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to\r\n     scorn as a 'flighty' person who endeavours to 'prop up his\r\n     utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation,' and whose 'mode\r\n     of dealing with nature' is reprobated as 'utterly dishonourable\r\n     to natural science.' And all this high and mighty talk, which\r\n     would have been indecent in one of Mr. Darwin's equals, proceeds\r\n     from a writer whose want of intelligence, or of conscience, or of\r\n     both, is so great, that, by way of an objection to Mr. Darwin's\r\n     views, he can ask, 'Is it credible that all favourable varieties\r\n     of turnips are tending to become men'; who is so ignorant of\r\n     palæontology that he can talk of the 'flowers and fruits' of the\r\n     plants of the carboniferous epoch; of comparative anatomy, that\r\n     he can gravely affirm the poison apparatus of venomous snakes to\r\n     be 'entirely separate from the ordinary laws of animal life, and\r\n     peculiar to themselves'; of the rudiments of physiology, that he\r\n     can ask, 'what advantage of life could alter the shape of the\r\n     corpuscles into which the blood can be evaporated?' Nor does the\r\n     reviewer fail to flavour this outpouring of incapacity with a\r\n     little stimulation of the _odium theologicum_. Some inkling of\r\n     the history of the conflicts between astronomy, geology, and\r\n     theology leads him to keep a retreat open by the proviso that he\r\n     cannot 'consent to test the truth of Natural Science by the Word\r\n     of Revelation,' but for all that he devotes pages to the\r\n     exposition of his conviction that Mr. Darwin's theory\r\n     'contradicts the revealed relation of the creation to its\r\n     Creator,' and is 'inconsistent with the fulness of His glory.'\"\r\n\r\nIn a footnote to this passage, Huxley wrote that he was not aware when\r\nwriting these lines that the authorship of the article had been avowed\r\npublicly. He adds, however:\r\n\r\n     \"Confession unaccompanied by penitence, however, affords no\r\n     ground for mitigation of judgment; and the kindliness with which\r\n     Mr. Darwin speaks of his assailant, Bishop Wilberforce, is so\r\n     striking an exemplification of his singular gentleness and\r\n     modesty, that it rather increases one's indignation against the\r\n     presumption of his critic.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Wilberforce was a man of no particular information\r\nin letters or in philosophy, and his knowledge of science was of the\r\nvaguest: a little natural history picked up from Gosse, the naturalist\r\nof the seashore, in the course of a few days' casual acquaintance at\r\nthe seaside, and some pieces of anatomical facts with which he was\r\nprovided, it is supposed, by Owen, for the purposes of the review. But\r\nhe bore a great name, and misused a great position; he was a man of\r\nfacile intelligence, smooth, crafty, and popular, and in this case he\r\nwas convinced that he was doing the best possible for the great\r\ninterests of religion by authoritatively denouncing a man whose\r\ncharacter he was incapable of realising, and on whose work he was\r\nincompetent to pronounce an opinion. Against an enemy of this kind,\r\nHuxley was implacable and relentless. He was constitutionally\r\nincapable of tolerating pretentious ignorance, and he had realised\r\nfrom the first that there could be no question of giving and taking\r\nquarter from persons who were more concerned to suppress doctrines\r\nthey conceived to be dangerous than to examine into their truth. On\r\nthe other hand, much as Huxley disliked Owen's devious ways, and\r\nalthough in after life there occurred many and severe differences of\r\nopinion between Huxley and Owen, Huxley had a sincere respect for much\r\nof Owen's anatomical and palæontological work, and when, in 1894,\r\nOwen's _Life_ was published, one of the most interesting parts of it\r\nwas a long, fair, and appreciative review by Huxley of Owen's\r\ncontributions to knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe middle of 1860, however, was not a time for Huxley, in his\r\ncapacity as Darwin's chief defender, to make truce with the enemy. In\r\nEngland a certain number of well-known scientific men had given a\r\ngeneral support to Darwinism. From France, Germany, and America there\r\nhad come some support and a good deal of cold criticism, but most\r\npeople were simmering with disturbed emotions. The newspapers and the\r\nreviews were full of the new subject; political speeches and sermons\r\nwere filled with allusions to it. Wherever educated people talked the\r\nconversation came round to the question of evolution. Were animals and\r\nplants the results of special creations, or were they, including man,\r\nthe result of the gradual transformations of a few simple primitive\r\ntypes evolving under the stress of some such force as Darwin's natural\r\nselection? To many people it seemed to be a choice between a world\r\nwith God and a world without God; and the accredited defenders of\r\nreligion gathered every force of argument, of misrepresentation,\r\nconscious and unconscious, of respectability, and of prejudice to\r\ncrush once for all the obnoxious doctrine and its obnoxious\r\nsupporters. In the autumn of that year it fell that the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association, then coming into prominence as the annual\r\nparliament of the sciences, was to be held at Oxford. It was\r\ninevitable that evolution should be debated formally and informally in\r\nthe sessions of the Association, and it must have seemed to the\r\northodox that there, in that beautiful city, its air vibrant with\r\ntinkling calls to faith, its halls and libraries crowded with the\r\ndevout and the learned, its history and traditions alike calling on\r\nall to defend the old fair piety, in such an uncongenial air, the\r\nsupporters of evolution must be overwhelmed. Almost the whole weight\r\nof the attack had to be resisted by Huxley. In the various sectional\r\nmeetings he had combat after combat with professors and clerics. Of\r\nthese dialectic fights the most notable were one with Owen on the\r\nanatomical structure of the brain, and another with Wilberforce upon\r\nthe general question of evolution. Owen contended that there were\r\nanatomical differences not merely of degree but of kind between the\r\nbrain of man and the brain of the highest ape, and his remarks were\r\naccepted by the audience as a complete and authoritative blow to the\r\ntheory of descent. Huxley at once met Owen with a direct and flat\r\ncontradiction, and pledged his reputation to justify his contradiction\r\nwith all due detail on a further occasion. As a matter of fact, he did\r\njustify the contradiction, and no anatomist would now dream of\r\nattempting the support of the proposition rashly made by Owen; but,\r\nat the time, the position of Owen and the sympathies of the audience\r\ntook away much of their effect from Huxley's words. Two days later,\r\nWilberforce, in a scene of considerable excitement, made a long,\r\neloquent, and declamatory speech against evolution and against Huxley.\r\nFrom the incomplete reports of the debate that were published, it is\r\ndifficult to gain a very clear idea of the Bishop's speech; but it is\r\ncertain that it was eloquent and facile, and that it appealed strongly\r\nto the religious prejudices of the majority of the audience. He ended\r\nby a gibe which, under ordinary circumstances, might have passed\r\nsimply as the rude humour of a popular orator, but which in that\r\nelectric atmosphere stung Huxley into a retort that has become\r\nhistorical. He asked Huxley whether he was related by his\r\ngrandfather's or grandmother's side to an ape. Huxley replied:\r\n\r\n     I asserted, and I repeat, that a man has no reason to be ashamed\r\n     of having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor\r\n     whom I should feel shame in recalling, it would be a _man_, a man\r\n     of restless and versatile intellect, who, not content with an\r\n     equivocal success in his own sphere of activity, plunges into\r\n     scientific questions with which he has no real acquaintance, only\r\n     to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and distract the\r\n     attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent\r\n     digressions, and skilled appeals to religious prejudice.\r\n\r\nAn eye-witness has told the present writer that Huxley's speech\r\nproduced little effect at the time. In the minds of those of the\r\naudience best qualified to weigh biological arguments, there was\r\nlittle doubt but that he had refuted Owen, and simply dispelled the\r\nvaporous effusions of the Bishop; but the majority of the audience\r\nretained the old convictions. The combat was removed to a wider\r\ntribunal. From that time forwards Huxley, by a series of essays,\r\naddresses, and investigations, continued almost to the end of his\r\nlife, tried to convince, and succeeded in convincing, the intellectual\r\nworld. At the risk of wearying by repetition we shall again insist\r\nupon the side of Darwinism that Huxley fought for and triumphed for.\r\n\r\nLong before the time of Darwin and Huxley, almost at the beginning of\r\nrecorded thought, philosophers busied themselves with the wonderful\r\ndiversity of the living world and with speculations as to how it had\r\nassumed its present form. From the earliest times to this century,\r\ntheories as to the living world fell into one or other of two main\r\ngroups. The key-note of one group was the fixity of species: the\r\nbelief that from their first appearance species were separate,\r\nindependent entities, one never springing from another, new species\r\nnever arising by the modification in different directions of\r\ndescendants of already existing species. The key-note of the other\r\ngroup of theories was the idea of progressive change: that animals and\r\nplants as they passed along the stream of time were continually being\r\nmoulded by the forces surrounding them, and that the farther back the\r\nmind could go in imagination the fewer and simpler species would be;\r\nuntil, in the first beginning, all the existing diverse kinds of\r\nliving creatures would converge to a single point. It may be that, on\r\nthe whole, the idea of fixity prevailed more among thinkers with a\r\nreligious bias; but for the most part the theories were debated\r\nindependently of the tenets of any faith, Christian or other. There\r\nwere sceptical defenders of fixity and religious upholders of\r\nevolution. However, in Christian countries, from the time of the\r\nReformation onwards, a change in this neutrality of religion to\r\ntheories of the living world took place. As Pascal prophesied,\r\nProtestantism rejected the idea of an infallible Church in favour of\r\nthe idea of an infallible book, and, because it happened that this\r\nbook included an early legend of the origin of the world in a form\r\napparently incompatible with evolution, Protestantism and, to a lesser\r\nand secondary extent, Catholicism, assumed the position that there was\r\nno place for evolution in a Christian philosophy. At the end of last\r\ncentury, and up to the middle of this century, the problem was not\r\nraised in any acute form. The chief anatomists and botanists were\r\noccupied with the investigation and discovery of facts, and, in an\r\nordinary way, without taking any particular trouble about it, accepted\r\nmore or less loosely the idea that species were fixed. Now and then an\r\nevolutionist propounded his views; but, as a rule, he supported them\r\nwith a knowledge of facts very much inferior to that possessed by the\r\nmore orthodox school. Then came Herbert Spencer, reasserting evolution\r\nin the old broad spirit, not merely in its application to species, but\r\nas the guiding principle of the whole universe from the integrations\r\nof nebulæ into systems of suns and planets to the transformations of\r\nchemical bodies. Before his marvellous generalisations had time to\r\ngrip biologists, there came Darwin; and Darwin brought two things:\r\nfirst, a re-statement of the fact of evolution as applied to the\r\nliving world, supported by an enormous body of evidence, new and old,\r\npresented with incomparably greater force, clearness, patience, and\r\nknowledge than had ever been seen before; and, second, the exposition\r\nof the principle of natural selection as a mechanism which might have\r\ncaused, and probably did cause, evolution.\r\n\r\nHuxley, as has been shewn, like many other anatomists, was ready for\r\nthe general principle of evolution. In fact, so far as it concerned\r\nthe great independent types which he believed to exist among animals,\r\nhe was more than prepared for it. Let us take a single definite\r\nexample of his position. In his work on the Medusæ, he had shewn how a\r\nlarge number of creatures, at first sight diverse, were really\r\nmodifications of a single great type, and he used language which, now\r\nthat all zoölogists accept evolution in the fullest way, requires no\r\nchange to be understood:\r\n\r\n     \"What has now been advanced will, perhaps, be deemed evidence\r\n     sufficient to demonstrate,--first, that the organs of these\r\n     various families are traceable back to the same point in the way\r\n     of development; or, secondly, when this cannot be done, that they\r\n     are connected by natural gradations with organs which are so\r\n     traceable; in which case, according to the principles advanced in\r\n     57, the various organs are homologous, and the families have a\r\n     real affinity to one another and should form one group.... It\r\n     appears, then, that these five families are by no means so\r\n     distinct as has hitherto been supposed, but that they are members\r\n     of one great group, organised upon one simple and uniform plan,\r\n     and, even in their most complex and aberrant forms, reducible to\r\n     the same type. And I may add, finally, that on this theory it is\r\n     by no means difficult to account for the remarkable forms\r\n     presented by the Medusæ in their young state. The Medusæ are the\r\n     most perfect, the most individualised animals of the series, and\r\n     it is only in accordance with what very generally obtains in the\r\n     animal kingdom, if, in their early condition, they approximate\r\n     towards the simplest forms of the group to which they belong.\"\r\n\r\nSuch words, written before 1849, only differ from those that would\r\nhave been written by a convinced evolutionist by a hair's breadth. But\r\nHuxley was not an evolutionist then: it was Darwin's work, containing\r\na new exposition of evolution and the new principle of natural\r\nselection, that convinced him, not of natural selection but of\r\nevolution. At Oxford, in 1860, it was for evolution, and not for\r\nnatural selection, that he spoke; and throughout his life afterwards,\r\nas he expressed it, it was this \"ancient doctrine of evolution,\r\nrehabilitated and placed upon a sound scientific foundation, since,\r\nand in consequence of, the publication of _The Origin of Species_,\"\r\nthat furnished him with the chief inspiration of his work. The clear\r\naccuracy of his original judgment upon Darwin's work has been\r\nabundantly justified by subsequent history. Since 1859 the case for\r\nevolution has become stronger and stronger until it can no longer be\r\nregarded as one of two possible hypotheses in the field, but as the\r\nonly view credible to those who have even a moderate acquaintance with\r\nthe facts. In 1894, thirty years after the famous meeting at Oxford,\r\nthe British Association again met in that historic town. The\r\nPresident, Lord Salisbury, a devout Churchman and with a notably\r\ncritical intellect, declared of Darwin:\r\n\r\n     \"He has, as a matter of fact, disposed of the doctrine of the\r\n     immutability of species.... Few now are found to doubt that\r\n     animals separated by differences far exceeding those that\r\n     distinguish what we know as species have yet descended from\r\n     common ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley, in replying to the address, used the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"As he noted in the Presidential Address to which they had just\r\n     listened with such well deserved interest, he found it stated, on\r\n     what was then and at this time the highest authority for them,\r\n     that as a matter of fact the doctrine of the immutability of\r\n     species was disposed of and gone. He found that few were now\r\n     found to doubt that animals separated by differences far\r\n     exceeding those which they knew as species were yet descended\r\n     from a common ancestry. Those were their propositions; those were\r\n     the fundamental principles of the doctrine of evolution.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Huxley all through his life, while holding that\r\nnatural selection was by far the most probable hypothesis as to the\r\nmode in which evolution had come about, maintained that it was only a\r\nhypothesis, and, unlike evolution, not a proved fact. In 1863, in a\r\ncourse of lectures to workingmen, he declared:\r\n\r\n     \"I really believe that the alternative is either Darwinism or\r\n     nothing, for I do not know of any rational conception or theory\r\n     of the organic universe which has any scientific position at all\r\n     beside Mr. Darwin's.... But you must recollect that when I say I\r\n     think it is either Mr. Darwin's hypothesis or nothing; that\r\n     either we must take his view, or look upon the whole of organic\r\n     nature as an enigma, the meaning of which is wholly hidden from\r\n     us; you must understand that I mean that I accept it\r\n     provisionally, in exactly the same way as I accept any other\r\n     hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1878 he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"How far natural selection suffices for the production of species\r\n     remains to be seen. Few can doubt that, if not the whole cause,\r\n     it is a very important factor in that operation; and that it must\r\n     play a great part in the sorting out of varieties into those\r\n     which are transitory and those which are permanent.\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in accepting natural selection as more than a\r\nhypothesis is simply that we have no experimental knowledge of its\r\nbeing able to produce the mutual infertility which is so striking a\r\ncharacter of species. This difficulty is, in the first place, the\r\ndifficulty of proving a negative. It might be possible to prove that\r\nits operation actually does produce species; it will always be\r\nimpossible to prove that, in the past, natural selection, and no other\r\nknown or unknown agency or combination of agencies, had a share in\r\nthe process. All naturalists are now agreed that, as a matter of\r\nhistorical fact, it was the propounding of natural selection by Darwin\r\nthat led to the acceptance of evolution, to the fact that evolution\r\n\"takes its place alongside of those accepted truths which must be\r\nreckoned with by philosophers of all schools.\" The difficulty as to\r\nnatural selection still exists, and there is no better way to express\r\nit than in Huxley's words, written in the early sixties:\r\n\r\n     \"But, for all this, our acceptance of the Darwinian hypothesis\r\n     must be provisional so long as one link in the chain of evidence\r\n     is wanting; and, so long as all the animals and plants certainly\r\n     produced by selective breeding from a common stock are fertile\r\n     with one another, that link will be wanting; for, so long,\r\n     selective breeding will not be proved to be competent to do all\r\n     that is required of it to produce natural species.... I adopt Mr.\r\n     Darwin's hypothesis, therefore, subject to the production of\r\n     proof that physiological species may be produced by selective\r\n     breeding; just as a physical philosopher may accept the\r\n     undulatory theory of light, subject to the proof of the existence\r\n     of the hypothetical ether; or as the chemist adopts the atomic\r\n     theory, subject to the proof of the existence of atoms; and for\r\n     exactly the same reasons, namely, that it has an immense amount\r\n     of _prima facie_ probability; that it is the only means at\r\n     present within reach of reducing the chaos of observed facts to\r\n     order; and, lastly, that it is the most powerful instrument of\r\n     investigation which has been presented to the naturalists since\r\n     the invention of the natural system of classification, and the\r\n     commencement of the systematic study of embryology.\"--_Man's\r\n     Place in Nature_, p. 149.[E]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Further details on the subject of this chapter may be\r\nobtained in Clodd's excellent volume, _Pioneers of Evolution_, where\r\nan account of the history of the idea of evolution from the earliest\r\ntimes is given; and in Poulton's _Charles Darwin and the Theory of\r\nNatural Selection_, where there is a particularly valuable chapter\r\nupon Huxley's relation to Darwinism.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nVERTEBRATE ANATOMY\r\n\r\n     The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull--Goethe, Oken, Cuvier, and\r\n     Owen--Huxley Defends Goethe--His Own Contributions to the\r\n     Theory--The Classification of Birds--Huxley Treats them as\r\n     \"Extinct Animals\"--Geographical Distribution--Sclater's\r\n     Regions--Huxley's Suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that some of the most important of the contributions made\r\nby Huxley to zoölogical knowledge were in the field of the lower\r\nanimals, especially of those marine forms for the study of which he\r\nhad so great opportunities on the _Rattlesnake_. A great bulk of his\r\nzoölogical work, however, related to the group of back-boned animals.\r\nThese, by their natural affinities and anatomical structure, are more\r\nclosely related to man, and, as Huxley began his scientific work as a\r\nmedical student, the groundwork of all his knowledge was study of the\r\nanatomy and physiology of man. Moreover, throughout the greater part\r\nof his working life, he had more to do with the extinct forms of life.\r\nThe vertebrate animals, from the great facility for preservation which\r\ntheir hard skeleton presents, as well as from the extremely important\r\nanatomical characters of the skeleton, bulk more largely in the study\r\nof palæontology than does any other group. In each of the great\r\ngroups of vertebrate animals, in fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds,\r\nand mammals, Huxley did important work. Much of this is embodied in\r\nhis treatise on _Vertebrate Anatomy_, but to some particular parts of\r\nit special attention may now be directed, as much because these serve\r\nas excellent examples of his method of work as because of their\r\nintrinsic importance.\r\n\r\nThe skull is the most striking feature in the skeleton of vertebrate\r\nanimals, and to the theory and structure of the vertebrate skull\r\nHuxley paid special attention, and his views and summary of the views\r\nof others form the basis of our modern knowledge. This work was put\r\nbefore the public in the course of a series of lectures on Comparative\r\nAnatomy given in 1863, while Huxley was Hunterian Professor at the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons, and the beginnings of it were contained in\r\na Croonian lecture to the Royal Society in 1858.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the skull which held the field was known as the\r\nvertebral theory. The great bulk of the nervous system of vertebrate\r\nanimals consists of a mass of tissue lying along the dorsal line of\r\nthe body and enclosed in a cartilaginous or bony sheath. The nerve\r\ntissue is the brain and spinal cord; the sheath is the skull in front\r\nand the vertebral column along the greater part of the length of the\r\nanimal. The brain may be taken simply as an anterior portion of the\r\nnerve mass, corresponding in a general way to an expansion of the\r\nspinal cord in the region of the anterior limbs and an expansion in\r\nthe region of the hind limbs, the latter indeed having recently been\r\nshown in some extinct creatures to surpass the brain in size. In a\r\nsimilar simple fashion the skull may be taken as an expanded anterior\r\npart of the vertebral column, serving as an expanded box for the\r\nbrain, just as in the regions of the pectoral and pelvic expansions\r\nof the cord there are similar expansions of the surrounding bony case.\r\nWe know now, from greater knowledge of its embryological development,\r\nthat the brain contains structures quite peculiar to itself, and\r\ndiffers from the spinal cord in kind as well as in size; but, at the\r\nsame time, when the vertebral theory of the skull was inaugurated,\r\nembryological knowledge and the importance of its relation to\r\nanatomical structure were less considered. What Huxley did was to show\r\nthat the skull, in its mode of origin and real nature, was not merely\r\nan expanded portion of the vertebral column, but that it differed from\r\nit in kind.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of the vertebral structure of the skull was due both to\r\nGoethe, the great German poet, and Oken, a most able but somewhat\r\nmystic German anatomist. An attempt had been made by a well-known\r\nEnglish anatomist to cast on Goethe the stigma of having tried to rob\r\nOken of the credit for this theory. Huxley set that matter finally at\r\nrest, disproving and repelling with indignation the unworthy\r\nsuggestion. Oken gave out his theory in 1807, and described how it had\r\nbeen first suggested to his mind by the accident of picking up a dried\r\nand battered sheep's skull, in which the apparent vertebral structure\r\nwas very obvious, as, indeed, anyone may see at a glance. It was in\r\n1820, long after the theory had been made current, that the poet first\r\npublicly narrated that in a similar way he had long before come to the\r\nsame conclusion; but Huxley was able to show that, although announcing\r\nit later, Goethe had in reality anticipated the anatomist. A passage\r\noccurs in a letter to a friend, of a date in 1790, which admits of no\r\ndoubt. \"By the oddest happy chance, my servant picked up a bit of an\r\nanimal's skull in the Jews' cemetery at Venice, and, by way of a\r\njoke, held it out to me as if he were offering me a Jew's skull. I\r\nhave made a great step in the formation of animals.\" It is an\r\ninteresting trait in Huxley's character, to find him zealous in\r\ndefence of the reputation of a great man, even although that man had\r\nbeen dead more than half a century; but it may be added that his just\r\nzeal was at least stimulated by the fact that the maligner of Goethe\r\nwas Owen, the conduct of whom, with regard to Darwin and Huxley,\r\nHuxley had had just reason for resenting.\r\n\r\nThe theory, then, which had dropped stillborn from Goethe, but which\r\nOken developed, was simply that the skull consisted of a series of\r\nexpanded vertebræ. Each vertebra consists of a basal piece or centrum,\r\nthe anterior and posterior faces of which are closely applied to the\r\nface of an adjoining vertebra, and of a bony arch or ring which\r\nencloses and protects the nervous cord. Oken supposed that there were\r\nfour such vertebræ in the skull, the centra being firmly fused and the\r\narches expanded to form the dome of the skull. Quite correctly, he\r\ndivided the skull into four regions, corresponding to what he called\r\nan ear vertebra, at the back, through which the auditory nerves\r\npassed; a jaw vertebra, in the sphenoidal region, through which the\r\nnerves to the jaws passed; an eye vertebra in front, pierced by the\r\noptic nerves, and again in front a nose vertebra, the existence of\r\nwhich he doubted at first. Quite rightly, he discriminated between the\r\nordinary bones of the skull and the special structures surrounding the\r\ninner ear which he declared to be additions derived from another\r\nsource. So far it cannot be doubted that the vertebral theory made a\r\ndistinct advance in our knowledge of the skull. It was to a certain\r\nextent, however, thrown into disrepute by various fantastic theories\r\nwith which Oken surrounded it. Later on, Cuvier removed from it these\r\nwilder excrescences, and amplified the basis of observation upon which\r\nthe underlying theory of the unity of type of the skull throughout the\r\nvertebrates was based. Cuvier, however, came to reject the theory,\r\nexcept so far as it applied to the posterior or occipital segment of\r\nthe skull. Later on, Owen resuscitated the theory, first throwing\r\ndoubt on the merit of Goethe, and then suggesting that Oken, instead\r\nof relying on the observed facts, had deduced the whole theory from\r\nhis own imagination. Owen, although he made no new contribution to\r\nfact or theory in this matter, practically claimed the whole credit of\r\nit as a scientific hypothesis.\r\n\r\nWhen Huxley took up the subject, the position was that the vertebral\r\ntheory was in full possession of the field, under the auspices of\r\nOwen. Huxley began afresh from observed facts. The first object of his\r\ninvestigation was to settle once for all the question as to whether\r\nthe skulls of all vertebrates were essentially modifications of the\r\nsame type. He took in succession the skulls of man, sheep, bird,\r\nturtle, and carp, and showed that in all these there were to be\r\ndistinguished the same four basi-cranial regions: the basi-occipital,\r\nbasi-sphenoid, pre-sphenoid, and ethmoid. These were essentially\r\nidentical with the centra of the four vertebræ of Oken. Similarly, he\r\nshowed the composition of the lateral and dorsal walls, proving the\r\nessential identity of the structures involved and of their relations\r\nto the nerve exits in the great types he had chosen. In the series of\r\nlectures delivered before the College of Surgeons, he extended his\r\nobservations to a much larger series of vertebrates, and substantially\r\nlaid down the main lines of our knowledge of the skull. In two\r\nimportant respects his statements were not merely a codification of\r\nexisting knowledge, but an important extension of it. He distinguished\r\nthe different modes in which the jaws may be suspended to the skull,\r\nand established for these different kinds of suspensoria the names\r\nwhich have ever since been employed. He proved clearly what had been\r\nsuggested by Oken, that the region of the ear is a lateral addition to\r\nthe skull, and he distinguished in it three bones, his names for which\r\nhave since become the common property of anatomists. Finally, he made\r\nit plain beyond any possible doubt that the skulls of all vertebrates\r\nwere built upon a common plan.\r\n\r\nHaving established the facts, he proceeded to enquire into the theory.\r\nThere was now a new method for investigating such problems, the method\r\nof embryology, which, practically, had not been available to Oken, and\r\nof which neither Cuvier nor Owen had made proper use. By putting\r\ntogether the investigations of a number of embryologists, by adding to\r\nthese himself, and, lastly, by interpreting the facts which his\r\ninvestigations into comparative anatomy had brought to light, he\r\nshewed that the vertebral theory could not be maintained. He shewed,\r\nby these methods, that, though both skull and vertebral column are\r\nsegmented, the one and the other, after an early stage, are fashioned\r\non lines so different as to exclude the possibility of regarding the\r\ndetails of each as mere modifications of a common type. \"The spinal\r\ncolumn and the skull start from the same primitive condition, whence\r\nthey immediately begin to diverge.\" \"It may be true to say that there\r\nis a primitive identity of structure between the spinal or vertebral\r\ncolumn and the skull; but it is no more true that the adult skull is\r\na modified vertebral column than it would be to affirm that the\r\nvertebral column is a modified skull.\" Taking the embryological facts,\r\nhe shewed that the skull arose out of elements quite different from\r\nthose of the vertebral column. The notochord alone is common to both.\r\nThe skull is built up of longitudinal cartilaginous pieces, now known\r\nas the \"parachordals\" and \"trabeculæ,\" of sense capsules enclosing the\r\nnose and ear, and of various roofing bones. In the historical\r\ndevelopment of the skull three grades become apparent; a primitive\r\nstage, as seen in Amphioxus, where there is nothing but a fibrous\r\ninvestment of the nervous structures; a cartilaginous grade, as seen\r\nin the skate or shark, where the skull is formed of cartilage, very\r\nimperfectly hardened by earthy deposits; a bony stage, seen in most of\r\nthe higher animals. He shewed that in actual development of the higher\r\nanimals these historical grades are repeated, the skull being at first\r\na mere membranous or fibrous investment of the developing nervous\r\nmasses, then becoming cartilaginous, and, lastly, bony. He made some\r\nimportant prophetic remarks as to the probable importance that future\r\nembryological work would give to the distinction between cartilage and\r\nmembrane bones--a prophecy that has been more than fully realised by\r\nthe investigations of Hertwig and of others. Our present knowledge of\r\nthe skull differs from Huxley's conception practically only in a\r\nfuller knowledge of details. We know now that throughout the series\r\nthere is a primitive set of structures common to all animals higher in\r\nthe scale than Amphioxus, and forming the base and lateral walls of\r\nthe skull. This is termed the Chondrocraninm, because it is laid down\r\nin cartilage; it is composed of the separate elements which Huxley\r\nindicated, and, in different animals, as Huxley suggested, the exact\r\nlimits of the ossification of the primitive cartilages differ in\r\nextent, but occur in homologous situations. This primitive skull is\r\nroofed over by a series of membrane bones which have no connection in\r\norigin with the other portions of the skull, and which have no\r\nrepresentative in the vertebral column, but which are the direct\r\ndescendants of the bony scales clothing the external skin in\r\ncartilaginous fishes. In one respect only was Huxley erroneous. Partly\r\nby inadvertence, and partly because the minute details of vertebrate\r\nembryology became really familiar to zoölogists only after the\r\nelaborate work of Balfour of Cambridge, Huxley, in his account of the\r\nformation of the first beginnings of the skeleton in the embryo, made\r\nconfusion between the walls of the primitive groove, which, in\r\nreality, give rise to the nervous structures, and those embryonic\r\ntissues which form the skeletal system.\r\n\r\nThe next great piece of work which we may take as typical of Huxley's\r\ncontributions to vertebrate anatomy, is his classical study on the\r\nclassification of birds. The great group of birds contains a larger\r\nnumber of species than is known in any other group of vertebrates,\r\nand, in this vast assemblage of forms there is strikingly little\r\nanatomical difference. The ostrich and the humming-bird might perhaps\r\nbe taken as types of the extremest differences to be found, and yet,\r\nalthough these differ in size, plumage, adaptations, habits, mode of\r\nlife, and almost everything that can separate living things, the two\r\nconform so closely to the common type of bird structure that knowledge\r\nof the anatomy of one would be a sufficient guide, down to minute\r\ndetails, for dissection of the other. None the less, there are\r\nhundreds of thousands of species of birds between these two types. It\r\nis not surprising that to reduce this vast assemblage of similar\r\ncreatures to an ordered system of classification has proved one of the\r\nmost difficult tasks attempted by zoölogists. Before Huxley, it had\r\nbeen attempted by a number of distinguished zoölogists; but, for the\r\nmost part, these had relied too much on merely external characters and\r\non superficial modifications in obvious relation to habits. When\r\nHuxley, in the course of a set of lectures on Comparative Anatomy, was\r\nabout to approach the subject of birds he was asked by a zoölogist how\r\nhe proposed to treat them. \"I intend,\" he replied, \"to treat them as\r\nextinct animals.\" By that he meant that it was his purpose to make a\r\nprolonged study of their skeletal structures the basis of his\r\ngrouping, following the lines which Cuvier, Owen, and he himself had\r\npursued so successfully in the case of the fossil remains of\r\nvertebrates. The result was that this first systematic study of even\r\none set of the anatomical characters of the group completely reformed\r\nthe method by which all subsequent workers have tried to grapple with\r\nthe problem; ornithology was raised from a process akin to\r\nstamp-collecting to a reasoned scientific study. The immediate\r\npractical results were equally important. He was able to shew that\r\namong the innumerable known forms there were three grades of\r\nstructure. The lowest had already been recognised and named by\r\nHaeckel; it consisted of the Saururæ, or reptile-like, birds, and\r\ncontained a single fossil form, Archæopteryx, distinguished from all\r\nliving birds by the presence of a hand-like wing in which the\r\nmetacarpal bones were well developed and freely movable, and by the\r\npossession of a long lizard-like tail actually exceeding in length\r\nthe remainder of the spinal column. The next group of Ratites,\r\nalthough it contained only the Ostrich, Rhea, Emu, Cassowary, and\r\nApteryx, he shewed to be equivalent in anatomical coherence to the\r\nthird great group of Carinates, which includes the vast majority of\r\nliving birds. In his arrangement of the latter group, he laid most\r\nstress on the characters of the bony structures which form the palate,\r\nand by this simple means was able to lay down clearly at least the\r\nmain lines of a natural classification of the group.\r\n\r\nHuxley's work upon birds, like his work in many other branches of\r\nanatomy, has been so overlaid by the investigations of subsequent\r\nzoölogists that it is easy to overlook its importance. His employment\r\nof the skeleton as the basis of classification was succeeded by the\r\nwork of others who made a similar use of the muscular anatomy, of the\r\nintestinal canal, of the windpipe, of the tendons of the feet, and\r\nmany other structures which display anatomical modifications in\r\ndifferent birds. The modern student finds that all these new sets of\r\nfacts are much greater in bulk than the work of Huxley, and it is easy\r\nfor him to remain in ignorance that they were all suggested and\r\ninspired by the method which Huxley employed. He finds that further\r\nresearch has supplanted some of Huxley's conclusions, and it is easy\r\nfor him to remain in ignorance that the conclusions themselves\r\nsuggested the investigations which have modified them. Huxley's\r\nanatomical work was essentially living and stimulating, and too often\r\nit has become lost to sight simply because of the vast superstructures\r\nof new facts to which it gave rise.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with vertebrate anatomy is the subject of\r\ngeographical distribution. In 1857 the study of this important\r\ndepartment of zoölogy was placed on a scientific basis, practically\r\nfor the first time, by a memoir on the geographical distribution of\r\nbirds published in the _Journal_ of the Linnæan Society of London. It\r\nwas known in a general way that different kinds of creatures were\r\nfound in different parts of the world, but little attempt had been\r\nmade to map out the world into regions characterised by their animal\r\nand vegetable inhabitants, as the political divisions of the world are\r\ncharacterised by their different governments and policies. Mr.\r\nSclater, who two years later became secretary of the Zoölogical\r\nSociety of London, in his memoir introduced the subject in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n     \"It is a well-known and universally acknowledged fact that we can\r\n     choose two portions of the globe of which the respective fauna\r\n     and flora shall be so different that we should not be far wrong\r\n     in supposing them to have been the result of distinct creations.\r\n     Assuming, then, that there are, or may be, more areas of creation\r\n     than one, the question naturally arises how many of them are\r\n     there, and what are their respective extents and boundaries; or,\r\n     in other words, what are the most natural primary ontological\r\n     divisions of the earth's surface?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sclater's answer was that there are six great regions;\r\nNeotropical, Nearctic, Palæarctic, Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian,\r\nand his answer, with minor alterations and the addition of a great\r\nwealth of detail, has been accepted by zoölogy.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, however, Darwin gave a new meaning and a new\r\nimportance to Sclater's work, by the new interpretation he caused to\r\nbe placed on the words \"centres of creation.\" Sclater's facts and\r\nareas remained the same; Darwin rejected the idea of separate\r\ncreations in the older sense of the words, and laid stress on the\r\nimpossibility of accounting for the resemblances within a region and\r\nfor the differences between regions by climatic differences and so\r\nforth. He raised the questions of modes of dispersal and of barriers\r\nto dispersal, of similarities due to common descent, and of the\r\nmodifying results produced by isolation. He gave, in fact, a theory of\r\nthe \"creations\" which Mr. Sclater had shewn to be a probable\r\nassumption. It was in the nature of things that Huxley should make a\r\ncontribution to a set of problems so novel and of so much importance\r\nto zoölogy. In 1868, in the course of a memoir on the anatomy of the\r\ngallinaceous birds and their allies, he made a useful attempt, nearly\r\nthe first of its kind, to correlate anatomical facts with geographical\r\ndistribution. Having shewn the diverging lines of anatomical structure\r\nthat existed in the group of creatures he had been considering, he\r\nwent on to shew that there was a definite relation between the\r\nvarieties of structure and the different positions on the surface of\r\nthe globe occupied at the present time by the creatures in question.\r\nHe made, in fact, the geographical position a necessary part of the\r\nwhole idea of a species or of a group, and so introduced a conception\r\nwhich has become a permanent part of zoölogical science.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the number and limits of the zoölogical regions into\r\nwhich the world may be divided, Huxley raised a number of problems\r\nwhich have not yet reached a full solution. Mr. Sclater had divided\r\nthe world into six great regions: the Nearctic, including the\r\ncontinent of North America, with an overlap into what is called South\r\nAmerica by geographers; the Palæarctic, comprising Europe and the\r\ngreater part of Asia; the Oriental, containing certain southern\r\nportions of Asia, such as India south of the Himalayas and many of the\r\nadjacent islands; the Ethiopian, including Africa, except north of\r\nthe Sahara, and Madagascar; the Australian, containing Australia and\r\nNew Zealand and some of the more southeastern of the islands of Malay;\r\nthe Neotropical, including South America. Huxley first called\r\nattention to certain noteworthy resemblances between the Neotropical\r\nand the Australian regions of Sclater, and held that a primary\r\ndivision of the world was into _Arctogæa_, comprising the great land\r\nmasses of the Northern Hemisphere with a part of their extension\r\nacross the equator, and _Notogæa_, which contained Australia but not\r\nNew Zealand and South America. Although this acute suggestion has not\r\nbeen generally accepted as a modification of Mr. Sclater's scheme, it\r\ncalled attention in a striking fashion to some very remarkable\r\nfeatures in the distribution of animals. Subsequent writers have\r\nconsiderably extended Huxley's conception of the similarities to be\r\nfound among the more southern land areas. They have pointed out that\r\nthe most striking idea of the distribution of land and water on the\r\nsurface of the globe is to be got by considering the globe alternately\r\nfrom one pole and from the other. In the south, a clump of ice-bound\r\nland, well within the Antarctic Circle, surrounds the pole. All else\r\nis a wide domain of ocean broken only where tapering and isolated\r\ntongues of land, South America, the Cape, Australia, lean down from\r\nthe great land masses of the north. On the other hand, all the great\r\nland masses expand in the Northern Hemisphere, and shoulder one\r\nanother round the North Pole. America is separated from Asia only by\r\nthe shallowest and narrowest of straits; an elevation of a few fathoms\r\nwould unite Greenland with Europe. Science points definitely to some\r\npart of the great northern land area as the centre of life for at\r\nleast the larger terrestrial forms of life. We know that these arose\r\nsuccessively, primitive birds like the ostriches being older than\r\nhigher forms like the parrots and singing birds; the pouched\r\nmarsupials preceding the antelopes and the lion; the lemurs coming\r\nbefore the man-like apes. Each wave of life spread over the whole area\r\nproducing after its kind; then, pressing round the northern land area,\r\nit met a thousand different conditions of environment, different\r\nfoods, enemies, and climates, and broke up into different genera and\r\nspecies. But there was never a wave of life that was not followed by\r\nanother wave. In the struggle for existence between the newer and the\r\nolder forms, the older forms were gradually driven southwards towards\r\nthe diverging fringes of the land masses. The vanquished left behind\r\nthem on the field of battle only their bones, to become fossils.\r\nSometimes succeeding waves swept along to the extreme limits of the\r\nland, and many early types were utterly destroyed. But others found\r\nsanctuary in the ends of the South, and such survivors of older and\r\nearlier types of life cause a similarity between the southern lands\r\nthat Huxley called Notogæa, although the extent of his region must be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, there has been a recurrence to Huxley's suggested\r\nunion of South America and Australia, based on new evidence of a\r\ndirect kind, quite different from that which had just been given.\r\nVarious groups of naturalists have stated that there are similarities\r\nbetween the invertebrate inhabitants of Australia and of South America\r\nof a kind which makes the existence of a direct land connection in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere extremely probable. Moreover, Ameghino has\r\nrecently described some marsupial fossils from South America which, he\r\nstates, belong to the Australian group of Dasyuridæ, and Oldfield\r\nThomas has described a new mammal from South America which is unlike\r\nthe opossums of America and like the diprotodonts of Australia. So\r\nthat, while the general opinion has been against Huxley's division,\r\nNotogæa, in the strict meaning which he gave to it, there has recently\r\nbeen an opinion growing in its favour.\r\n\r\nHuxley also made minor alterations in Mr. Sclater's scheme by forming\r\nan additional circumpolar region for the Northern Hemisphere, and by\r\nelevating New Zealand into a separate region, distinct from Australia.\r\nOn these points there is a balance of opinion against his views.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of Huxley's contributions to vertebrate\r\nanatomy, the actual details of which would occupy far too much space,\r\nit is necessary to mention the great importance to zoölogy of the new\r\nterms and new ideas he introduced into classification. His mind was,\r\nabove all things, orderly and comprehensive, and while, in innumerable\r\nminute points, from the structure of the palate of birds to the\r\nstructure of the roots of human hair (actually the subject of Huxley's\r\nfirst published contribution to scientific knowledge), he added to the\r\nnumber of known facts, he did even more important work in\r\nco-ordinating and grouping together the known body of facts. To him\r\nare due not only the names, but the idea, that the mammalian animals\r\nfall into three grades of ascending complexity of organisation: the\r\nreptile-like Prototheria, which lay large eggs, and which have many\r\nother reptilian characters; the Metatheria, or marsupial animals; the\r\nEutheria, or higher animals, which include all the common animals from\r\nthe mole or rabbit up to man. In a similar fashion, he grouped the\r\nvertebrates into three divisions, and named them: Ichthyopsida, which\r\ninclude the fish and Amphibia, creatures in which the aquatic habit\r\ndominates the life history and the anatomical structure; Sauropsida,\r\nincluding birds and reptiles, on the close connection between which he\r\nthrew so much light; Mammalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMAN AND THE APES\r\n\r\n     Objections to Zoölogical Discussion of Man's Place--Owen's\r\n     Prudence--Huxley's Determination to Speak out--Account of his\r\n     Treatment of _Man's Place in Nature_--Additions Made by More\r\n     Recent Work.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven before the publication of _The Origin of Species_ there was a\r\nconsiderable nervousness in the minds of the more orthodox as to\r\ndiscussions on the position of the human species in zoölogical\r\nclassification. Men of the broadest minds, such as Lyell, who himself\r\nhad suffered considerably from outside interference with the\r\nscientific right to publish scientific conclusions, was strongly\r\nopposed to anything that seemed to tend towards breaking down the\r\nbarrier between man and the lower creatures. Sir William Lawrence, a\r\nvery distinguished and able man, had been criticised with the greatest\r\nseverity, and had been nearly ostracised, for a very mild little book\r\n_On Man_; and Huxley tells us that the electors to the Chair of a\r\nScotch University had refused to invite a distinguished man, to whom\r\nthe post would have been acceptable, because he had advocated the view\r\nthat there were several species of man. The court political leaders,\r\nand society generally, resented strongly anything that seemed at all\r\nlikely to disturb the somewhat narrow orthodoxy prevalent in those\r\ntimes; and, as there were comparatively few posts open to scientific\r\nmen, and comparatively greater chances of posts being made for men of\r\ntalent and ability who adhered to the respectable traditions, those\r\nwho tampered with so serious a question as the place of man were\r\nlikely to burn their fingers severely. However, the difficulties of\r\ndiscussing these problems were much greater immediately after 1859.\r\nOne of the most surprising things in the history of this century is\r\nthe sudden intensity of the opposition of the public, particularly the\r\nrespectable and religious public, to zoölogical writing upon man,\r\nimmediately after the publication of the _Origin_. Before that time\r\nanatomists did not necessarily hesitate to point out the close\r\nresemblance between the anatomy of man and that of the higher apes,\r\nand the difficulties anatomists had in making anatomical distinction\r\nof value between them. Thus Professor Owen, who, as a writer, was\r\nrather unusually nervous about expressing facts to which any objection\r\nmight be raised by those outside the strictly scientific world, had\r\nwritten the following paragraph in the course of an essay on the\r\ncharacters of the class Mammalia, published, in 1857, in the _Journal\r\nof the Proceedings of the Linnæan Society_:\r\n\r\n     \"Not being able to appreciate or conceive of the distinction\r\n     between the psychical phenomena of a chimpanzee and of a\r\n     Boschisman or of an Aztec, with arrested brain-growth, as being\r\n     of a nature so essential as to preclude a comparison between\r\n     them, or as being other than a difference of degree, I cannot\r\n     shut my eyes to the significance of that all-pervading similitude\r\n     of structure--every tooth, every bone, strictly homologous--which\r\n     makes the determination of the difference between _Homo_ and\r\n     _Pithecus_ the anatomist's difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true, he went on to explain his belief in the existence of\r\ncertain characters in the brain which seemed to him to justify the\r\nseparation of man in a different group from that in which the apes\r\nwere placed; but it is certain that he regretted having said anything\r\nwhich seemed to support the Darwinian view; and, two years later, when\r\nthe opposition to Darwin was in its acutest stage, Owen withdrew his\r\nwords. His \"Reade Lecture,\" delivered in the University of Cambridge,\r\nwas in all respects a reprint of the essay from which we have just\r\nquoted, but the apparently dangerous words were omitted. More than\r\nthat, the points insisted on in the essay as being sufficient for the\r\npurpose of separating man in zoölogical classification were elevated\r\ninto a reason against descent. Although Huxley, in several addresses\r\nand publications, disproved the existence of the alleged differences,\r\nand although Sir William Flower gave an actual demonstration shewing\r\nthe essential identity of the brain of man and of the apes in the\r\nmatter in question, Owen never admitted his error.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DARWIN\r\nFrom the painting by Hon. John Collier in the National Portrait\r\nGallery]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that, if an anatomist so distinguished and acute\r\nas was Owen allowed his judgment to be completely overborne by the\r\nstorm of prejudice against Darwinism, those who were not anatomists\r\nshould have held up to ridicule all idea of comparison between man and\r\nthe apes. In _The Origin of Species_ itself, no elaborate attempt had\r\nbeen made to set forth the anatomical arguments in favour of or\r\nagainst a community of descent for man and the apes. But it was made\r\nsufficiently plain, and the public laid hold of the point eagerly,\r\nthat the doctrine of descent was not meant to exclude man from the\r\nfield of its operation. Huxley, in the course of his ordinary work as\r\nProfessor of Biology, had, among many other subjects, naturally\r\nturned his attention to the anatomy and classification of the\r\nhigher animals. When Owen's essay appeared, he found that he was\r\nunable to agree with many of the conclusions contained in it, and had\r\nset about a renewed investigation of the matter. Thus it happened\r\nthat, when the question became prominent, in 1860, Huxley was ready\r\nwith material contributions to it. He believed, moreover, that, as\r\nDarwin was not specially acquainted with the anatomy and development\r\nof vertebrates, there was an opportunity for doing a real service to\r\nthe cause of evolution. Accordingly, in 1860, he took for the subject\r\nof a series of lectures to workingmen the \"Relation of Man to the\r\nLower Animals,\" and, in 1862, expanded the lectures into a volume\r\ncalled _Man's Place in Nature_. When it was ready, he was prepared to\r\nsay with a good conscience that his conclusions \"had not been formed\r\nhastily or enunciated crudely.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I thought,\" he wrote in the preface to the 1894 edition, \"I had\r\n     earned the right to publish them, and even fancied I might be\r\n     thanked, rather than reproved, for so doing. However, in my\r\n     anxiety to promulgate nothing erroneous, I asked a highly\r\n     competent anatomist and very good friend of mine to look through\r\n     my proofs, and, if he could, point out any errors of fact. I was\r\n     well pleased when he returned them without any criticism on that\r\n     score; but my satisfaction was speedily dashed by the very\r\n     earnest warning, as to the consequences of publication, which my\r\n     friend's interest in my welfare led him to give; but, as I have\r\n     confessed elsewhere, when I was a young man there was just a\r\n     little--a mere _soupçon_--in my composition of that tenacity of\r\n     purpose which has another name, and I felt sure that all the evil\r\n     things prophesied would not be so painful to me as the giving up\r\n     of that which I had resolved to do, upon grounds which I\r\n     conceived to be right. So the book came out, and I must do my\r\n     friend the justice to say that his forecast was completely\r\n     justified. The Boreas of criticism blew his hardest blasts of\r\n     misrepresentation and ridicule for some years; and I was even as\r\n     one of the wicked. Indeed, it surprises me, at times, to think\r\n     how anyone who had sunk so low could have emerged into, at any\r\n     rate, relative respectability.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, in the same preface, Huxley strongly advises others to\r\nimitate his action in this matter. There are now, and no doubt there\r\nalways will be, truths \"plainly obvious and generally denied.\" Whoever\r\nattacks the current ideas is certain, unless human nature changes\r\ngreatly, to encounter a bitter opposition, and there will always be\r\nthose among his friends who recommend him to temper truth by prudence.\r\nHuxley's advice is different:\r\n\r\n     \"If there is a young man of the present generation who has taken\r\n     as much trouble as I did to assure himself that they are truths,\r\n     let him come out with them, without troubling his head about the\r\n     barking of the dogs of St. Ernulphus. _Veritas prævalebit_--some\r\n     day; and, even if she does not prevail in his time, he himself\r\n     will be all the better and wiser for having tried to help her.\r\n     And let him recollect that such great reward is full payment for\r\n     all his labour and pains.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough they were written so long ago, the lectures on \"Man's Place\r\nin Nature\" are still the best existing treatise on the subject, and we\r\nshall give an outline of them, mentioning the chief points in which\r\nfurther work has been done. Information concerning the man-like apes\r\nwas scattered in very different places, in the grave records of\r\nscientific societies, in the letters of travellers and missionaries,\r\nin the reports of the zoölogical societies which had been in\r\npossession of living specimens. The facts had to be sifted out from a\r\ngreat mass of verbiage and unfounded statement. With a characteristic\r\ndesire for historical accuracy, more usual in a man of letters than in\r\nan anatomist, Huxley began with a study of classical and mediæval\r\nlegends of the existence of pigmies and man-like creatures; but, while\r\nrecognising that legends of satyrs and fauns were presages of the\r\ndiscovery of man-like apes, he was unable to find any actual record\r\nearlier than that contained in Pigafetta's _Description of the Kingdom\r\nof Congo_, drawn up from the notes of a Portuguese sailor and\r\npublished in 1598. The descriptions and figures in this work\r\napparently referred to chimpanzees. From this date onwards he traces\r\nthe literature of the animals in question, and then proceeds to give\r\nan account of them.\r\n\r\nThere are four distinct kinds of man-like apes: in Eastern Asia the\r\nOrangs and the Gibbons (although some later writers differ from Huxley\r\nin removing the Gibbons from the group of anthropoids); in Western\r\nAfrica, the Chimpanzees and the Gorillas. All these have certain\r\ncharacters in common. They are inhabitants of the old world; they all\r\nhave the same number of teeth as man, possessing four incisors, two\r\ncanines, four premolars, and six true molars in each jaw, in the adult\r\ncondition, while the milk dentition, as in man, consists of twenty\r\nteeth,--four incisors, two canines, and four molars in each jaw. Since\r\nHuxley wrote, a large bulk of additional work upon teeth has been\r\npublished, and we now know that man and the anthropoid apes display\r\nthe same kind of degenerative specialisation in their jaws. Simpler\r\nand older forms of mammals had a much larger number of teeth, and\r\nthese differed among themselves more than the teeth of the higher\r\nforms. In the Anthropoids and Man, the jaws are proportionately\r\nshorter and less heavy than in simpler forms, and, in correspondence\r\nwith this, the number of the teeth has become reduced, while the teeth\r\nthemselves tend to form a more even row. The canine or eye-teeth are\r\nrelatively smaller in the gorilla than in primitive mammals; they are\r\nstill smaller in the lower races of man; while in ordinary civilised\r\nman they do not project above the others. The shortening of the jaw is\r\nstill proceeding, and, although in lower races of man the last molar\r\nor wisdom tooth is almost as large as the molars in front of it, in\r\nthe higher races the wisdom tooth is much smaller and frequently does\r\nnot develop at all, or begins to decay very soon after its appearance.\r\nIf the process of extinction of lower races were to proceed much\r\nfurther, so that civilised white races became the only human\r\ninhabitants of the earth, then the gap between the Anthropoids and Man\r\nwould be wider than it now is; man would be characterised by the\r\npresence of one tooth less than the anthropoids, just as the\r\nanthropoids and some lower monkeys are characterised by having one\r\ntooth less than monkeys still lower.\r\n\r\nIn all, the nostrils have a narrow partition and look downwards as in\r\nman. The arms are always longer than the legs, the difference being\r\ngreatest in the orang and least in the chimpanzee. We know now that in\r\nthe lower races of man, the arms are proportionately longer than in\r\nhigher races, and it has recently been shewn that, although there is a\r\ngeneral proportion between the length of the long bones and the height\r\nof the whole body in man, so that the height may be calculated with an\r\naverage error from these bones, yet the probable error is greater when\r\nthe calculation is made from the arms than when it is made from the\r\nlegs. In fact, the length of arm as compared to the length of leg and\r\nto whole height is a more variable feature in man than the length of\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nIn all the anthropoids, the forelimbs end in hands with longer or\r\nshorter thumbs, and the great toe, always smaller than in man, is far\r\nmore movable and can be opposed like a thumb to the other toes. Since\r\nHuxley wrote, a considerable amount of evidence has been collected\r\nshewing that partial opposability of the toe in man is not uncommon,\r\nand that there is evidence as to a tendency to increase of length of\r\nthe great toe within historical times. None of the great apes have\r\ntails, and none of them have the cheek pouches common among lower\r\nmonkeys.\r\n\r\nHuxley then gives an account of the natural history of these animals,\r\nan account which still remains the best in literature. He sums up the\r\nhabits of the Asiatic forms as follows:\r\n\r\n1. They may readily move along the ground in the erect, or semi-erect\r\nposition, and without direct support from the arms.\r\n\r\n2. They may possess an extremely loud voice, so loud as to be readily\r\nheard one or two miles.\r\n\r\n3. They may be capable of great viciousness and violence when\r\nirritated; and this is especially true of adult males.\r\n\r\n4. They may build a nest to sleep in.\r\n\r\nHe finds the same general characters in the case of the gorilla and\r\nchimpanzee, but in their case there was not quite so reliable evidence\r\nupon which to go.\r\n\r\nAlthough, since Huxley wrote, there has been much greater opportunity\r\nof studying anthropoid apes, both in confinement and in their native\r\nhaunts, there is not much to add to his account. Some little time ago,\r\nthe world was interested by the assertion of a clever American that he\r\nhad discovered a kind of language used by the higher apes, and that he\r\nwas able to communicate with them. Mr. Garnier, the person in\r\nquestion, declared his intention of going out to tropical Africa and\r\nestablishing himself in a strong cage in the forests inhabited by\r\ngorillas and chimpanzees, in the hope that, impelled by curiosity,\r\nthey would look upon him as we look on monkeys in a zoölogical garden,\r\nand that he would thus be able to make his knowledge and records of\r\nmonkey language more perfect. As a matter of fact he went to Africa,\r\nand on his return published a volume which aroused the indignation of\r\nnaturalists. There was internal evidence that he had gone no further\r\nthan the garden of a coast station, and his pretended account of the\r\nhabits of monkeys as they lived in their native haunts contained\r\nnothing that was not already known. There is no doubt but that the\r\nanthropoid apes, like many other animals, use modulations of their\r\nvoice to express emotional states; that, in fact, they have love-cries\r\nand cries of warning, of alarm, and of pleasure; but there is not the\r\nsmallest evidence to suppose that in the case of the anthropoids these\r\ncries approach more nearly to speech than the cries of any other of\r\nthe higher mammals.\r\n\r\nSince Huxley's volume was published, a large amount of information has\r\nbeen published by Darwin, Romanes, and others upon the mental\r\ncapacities of anthropoids kept in confinement, and the result of this\r\nhas been to prove that the anthropoids, in especial the chimpanzees,\r\npossess mental powers more akin to those of man than are to be found\r\nin the most intelligent of the quadrupeds. We may cite some instances\r\nof these higher powers. Vosmaern had a tame female orang-outang that\r\nwas able to untie the most intricate knot with fingers or teeth, and\r\ntook such pleasure in doing it that she regularly untied the shoes of\r\nthose who came near her. The female chimpanzee called Sally, that\r\nlived for many years in the Zoölogical Society's Gardens in London,\r\nwas taught by its keeper and by Romanes an interesting variety of\r\n\"tricks\" involving at least the rudiments of what may be called human\r\nintelligence. Among other feats, it would pick up from the floor and\r\npresent to the keeper or to a visitor, a stated number of straws up to\r\nfive. Many monkeys seem nearly purely destructive in their dealings\r\nwith objects within their reach; but Leutemann tells of an\r\norang-outang which \"tried to put to its proper use whatever was given\r\nto him. To my great surprise he attempted to put on a pair of gloves.\r\nHe supported himself on a light walking cane and, when it bent under\r\nhim, made ridiculous motions to right it again.\" Brehm tells of a\r\nchimpanzee:\r\n\r\n     \"After eating, he at once begins to clean up. He holds a stick of\r\n     wood in front of him, or puts his hands in his master's slippers,\r\n     and slides about the room, then takes a cloth and scrubs the\r\n     floor. Scouring, sweeping, and dusting are his favourite\r\n     occupations; and, when he once gets hold of the cloth, he never\r\n     wants to give it up.\"\r\n\r\nFalkenstein has given a detailed description of a gorilla which was\r\nremarkable for his delicacy in eating.\r\n\r\n     \"He would take a cup or glass with the greatest care, using both\r\n     hands to carry it to his mouth, and setting it down so carefully\r\n     that I do not remember having lost a single piece of crockery\r\n     through him, though we had never tried to teach him the use of\r\n     such vessels, wishing to bring him to Europe as nearly in his\r\n     natural condition as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThese and a multitude of similar observations which have been made\r\nsince Huxley wrote are typical of the increase of our knowledge on the\r\nhabits and capacities of the anthropoid apes. They all serve to show\r\nthat in them the instinct for experimental investigation of\r\neverything with which they are surrounded, and their imitative\r\nfaculties are peculiarly great. The importance of this, from the point\r\nof view of Huxley's argument, is great. The difference between the\r\ninstincts of the lower animals and the intelligence of man is that\r\ninstincts are to a large extent fixed and mechanical. The proper\r\nperformance of an instinct demands the presence of exactly the right\r\nexternal conditions for its accomplishment. In the absence of these\r\nconditions, the call to perform the instinctive action is equally\r\ngreat, and results in useless performances. In many of the higher\r\nanimals these elaborate instincts are more general in their character,\r\nand are supplemented by a considerable but varying aptitude for\r\nmodification of instinctive action to suit varieties of surrounding\r\ncircumstances. As this intelligence becomes more and more developed,\r\nthe blind, mechanical instinct becomes weaker. A large number of\r\ninstances might be given of such instincts modified by dawning\r\nintelligence. The chief factors in producing the change are, as has\r\nbeen shewn by Professor Groos, the possession of a general instinct to\r\nimitate and to experiment, and the existence of a period of youth in\r\nwhich the young creature may practise these instincts, and so prepare\r\nitself for the more serious purposes of adult life. The anthropoid\r\napes seem to possess these experimental instincts to an extent much\r\ngreater than that observed in any other class of animals, and, as they\r\nhave a long period of youth, they have the opportunity of putting them\r\ninto practice to the fullest possible extent.\r\n\r\nFrom the natural history of the anthropoid apes, Huxley passed to\r\nconsideration of their relation to man, prefacing his observations\r\nwith a passage defending the utility of the enquiry, a passage\r\nnecessary enough in these days of prejudice, but now chiefly with\r\nhistorical interest:\r\n\r\n     \"It will be admitted that some knowledge of man's position in the\r\n     animate world is an indispensable preliminary to the proper\r\n     understanding of his relations to the universe; and this again\r\n     resolves itself in the long run into an enquiry into the nature\r\n     and the closeness of the ties which connect him with those\r\n     singular creatures whose history has been sketched in the\r\n     preceding pages.\r\n\r\n      \"The importance of such an enquiry is, indeed, intuitively\r\n     manifest. Brought face to face with these blurred copies of\r\n     himself, the least thoughtful of men is conscious of a certain\r\n     shock; due perhaps not so much to disgust at the aspect of what\r\n     looks like an insulting caricature, as to the awakening of a\r\n     sudden and profound mistrust of time-honoured theories and\r\n     strongly rooted prejudices regarding his own position in nature,\r\n     and his relations to the underworld of life; while that which\r\n     remains a dim suspicion for the unthinking, becomes a vast\r\n     argument, fraught with the deepest consequences, for all who are\r\n     acquainted with the recent progress of the anatomical and\r\n     physiological sciences.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley then proceeded to elaborate the argument from development for\r\nthe essential identity of man and the apes. This argument has now\r\nbecome more or less familiar to us all, as it has gained additional\r\nsupport from recent extension of embryological knowledge, and as it\r\nhas been used in every work on evolution since Huxley first laid\r\nstress on it. The adult forms of animals are much more complex than\r\ntheir embryonic stages, and the series of changes passed through in\r\nattaining the adult condition make up the embryological history of the\r\nanimal. Huxley took the embryology of the dog as an example of the\r\nprocess in the higher animals generally, and as it had been worked out\r\nin detail by a set of investigators. The dog, like all vertebrate\r\nanimals, begins its existence as an egg; and this body is just as much\r\nan egg as that of a fowl, although, in the case of the dog, there is\r\nnot the accumulation of nutritive material which bloats the egg of the\r\nhen into its enormous size. Since Huxley wrote, it has been shewn\r\nclearly that among the mammalian animals there has been a gradual\r\nreduction in the size of the egg. The ancestors of the mammals laid\r\nlarge eggs, like those of birds or reptiles; and there still exist two\r\nstrange mammalian creatures, the Ornithorhynchus and Echidna of\r\nAustralia, which lay large, reptilian-like eggs. The ancestors of most\r\nliving mammalia acquired the habit of retaining the eggs within the\r\nbody until they were hatched; and, as a result of this, certain\r\nstructures which grow out from the embryo while it is still within the\r\negg and become applied to the inner wall of the porous shell for the\r\npurpose of obtaining air, got their supply of oxygen, not from the\r\nouter air, but from the blood-vessels of the maternal tissues. When\r\nthis connection (called the placenta) between embryo and mother\r\nthrough the egg-shell became more perfect, not only oxygen but\r\nfood-material was obtained from the blood-vessels of the mother; and,\r\nin consequence, it became unnecessary for the eggs to be provided with\r\na large supply of food-yolk. Among existing marsupial animals, which,\r\non the whole, represent a lower type of mammalian structure than\r\nordinary mammals, there is more food-yolk than in ordinary mammals,\r\nand less food-yolk than in the two egg-laying mammals. In the ordinary\r\nmammals, such as the rabbit, dog, monkey, and man, there is\r\npractically no yolk whatever deposited in the egg; the egg is of\r\nminute size, and the embryo obtains most of its food from the maternal\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe small egg of the mammal divides into a number of cells, which form\r\na hollow sphere; on the upper surface of this the development of\r\norgans begins with the formation of a depression which indicates the\r\nfuture middle line of the animal, and is, in fact, the beginning of\r\nthe nervous system. Under this is formed a straight rod of gelatinous\r\nmaterial, the foundation of the vertebral column, and the body of the\r\nembryo is gradually pinched off from the surface of the hollow sphere.\r\nAfter tracing the details of this process, Huxley proceeded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"The history of the development of any other vertebrate animal,\r\n     lizard, snake, frog or fish, tells the same story. There is\r\n     always, to begin with, an egg, having the same essential\r\n     structure as that of the dog; the yolk of that egg always\r\n     undergoes division, or segmentation, as it is often called; the\r\n     ultimate products of that segmentation constitute the building\r\n     materials for the body of the young animal; and this is built up\r\n     round a primitive groove, in the floor of which a notochord is\r\n     developed. Furthermore, there is a period in which the young of\r\n     all these animals resemble one another, not merely in outward\r\n     form, but in all essentials of structure, so closely, that the\r\n     differences between them are inconsiderable, while in their\r\n     subsequent course they diverge more and more widely from one\r\n     another. And it is a general law, that, the more closely any\r\n     animals resemble one another in adult structure, the longer and\r\n     the more intimately do their embryos resemble one another; so\r\n     that, for example, the embryos of a snake and of a lizard remain\r\n     like one another longer than do those of a snake and of a bird;\r\n     and the embryos of a dog and of a cat remain like one another for\r\n     a far longer period than do those of a dog and a bird; or of a\r\n     dog and an opossum; or even than those of a dog and a monkey.\"\r\n\r\nThis general rule, that the longer the paths of embryonic development\r\nof two animals keep identical the more nearly the two animals are\r\nrelated, when Huxley wrote, was founded on a much smaller number of\r\nfacts than now are known. Since 1860 an enormous bulk of embryological\r\ninvestigation has been published, and the total result has been to\r\nconfirm Huxley's position in the fullest possible way. A certain\r\nnumber of exceptions have been found, but these exceptions are so\r\nobviously special adaptations to special circumstances that their\r\nexistence only makes the general truth of the proposition more clear.\r\nThe most common kind of exception occurs when two closely related\r\nanimals live under very different conditions. For instance, many\r\nmarine animals have close allies that in comparatively recent times\r\nhave taken to live in fresh water. The conditions of life in fresh\r\nwater are very different, especially for delicate creatures\r\nsusceptible to rapid changes of temperature, or unable to withstand\r\nstrong currents. Thus most of the allies of the fresh-water crayfish,\r\nwhich live in the sea, lay eggs from which there are soon hatched\r\nminute, almost transparent larvæ, exceedingly unlike the adult. In the\r\ncomparatively equable temperature of sea-water, and in the usual\r\nabsence of strong currents, these small larvæ, as Huxley shewed later\r\nin his volume on the _Crayfish_, live a free life, obtaining their own\r\nfood, and by a series of slow transformations gradually acquire the\r\nadult form. In fresh water, however, the delicate larvæ would be\r\nunable to live, and the mode of development is different. The series\r\nof slow transformations is condensed, and takes place almost entirely\r\ninside the egg-shell; so that, when hatching occurs, the young\r\ncrayfish is exceedingly like the adult. Apart from such special cases,\r\nit is true that the study of development affords a clear test of\r\ncloseness of structural affinity.\r\n\r\nHuxley then proceeds to discuss the development of man.\r\n\r\n     \"Is he something apart? Does he originate in a totally different\r\n     way from dog, bird, frog, and fish, thus justifying those who\r\n     assert him to have no place in nature, and no real affinity with\r\n     the lower world of animal life? Or does he originate in a similar\r\n     germ, pass through the same slow and gradually progressive\r\n     modifications, depend on the same contrivances for protection and\r\n     nutrition, and finally enter the world by the help of the same\r\n     mechanism? The reply is not doubtful for a moment, and has not\r\n     been doubtful any time these thirty years. Without question, the\r\n     mode of origin, and the early stages of the development of man\r\n     are identical with those of animals immediately below him in the\r\n     scale; without doubt, in these respects, he is far nearer the\r\n     apes than the apes are to the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThen, on lines with which, by continuous repetition and expansion by\r\nauthors subsequent to him, we have now become familiar, Huxley\r\ncompared, stage by stage, the development of man with that of other\r\nanimals, and shewed, first, its essential similarity, and then that in\r\nevery case where it departed from the development of the dog it\r\nresembled more closely the development of the ape. He went on to\r\nreview the anatomy of man:\r\n\r\n     \"Thus, identical in the physical processes by which he\r\n     originates,--identical, in the early stages of his\r\n     formation--identical in the mode of his nutrition before and\r\n     after birth, with the animals which lie immediately below him in\r\n     the scale,--Man, if his adult and perfect structure be compared\r\n     with theirs exhibits, as might be expected, a marvellous likeness\r\n     of organisation. He resembles them as they resemble one\r\n     another--he differs from, them as they differ from one another.\r\n     And, though these differences cannot be weighed and measured,\r\n     their value may be readily estimated; the scale or standard of\r\n     judgment, touching that value, being afforded and expressed by\r\n     the system of classification of animals now current among\r\n     zoölogists.\"\r\n\r\nHaving explained the general system of zoölogical classification, he\r\ntried to dispel preliminary prejudice by inducing his readers or\r\nbearers to take an outside view of themselves.\r\n\r\n     \"Let us endeavour for a moment to disconnect our thinking selves\r\n     from the mask of humanity; let us imagine ourselves scientific\r\n     Saturnians, if you will, fairly acquainted with such animals as\r\n     now inhabit the earth, and employed in discussing the relations\r\n     they bear to a new and singular 'erect and featherless biped,'\r\n     which some enterprising traveller, overcoming the difficulties of\r\n     space and gravitation, has brought from that distant planet for\r\n     our inspection, well preserved, may be, in a cask of rum. We\r\n     should all, at once, agree upon placing him among the mammalian\r\n     vertebrates; and his lower jaw, his molars, and his brain, would\r\n     leave no room for doubting the systematic position of the new\r\n     genus among those mammals whose young are nourished during\r\n     gestation by means of a placenta, or what are called the\r\n     placental mammals.\r\n\r\n      \"Further, the most superficial study would at once convince us\r\n     that, among the orders of placental mammals, neither the whales,\r\n     nor the hoofed creatures, nor the sloths and ant-eaters, nor the\r\n     carnivorous cats, dogs, and bears, still less the rodent rats and\r\n     rabbits, or the insectivorous moles and hedgehogs, or the bats,\r\n     could claim our _Homo_ as one of themselves.\r\n\r\n      \"There would remain, then, but one order for comparison, that of\r\n     the apes (using that word in its broadest sense), and the\r\n     question for discussion would narrow itself to this--Is Man so\r\n     different from any of these apes that he must form an order by\r\n     himself? Or does he differ less from them than they differ from\r\n     one another,--and hence must take his place in the same order\r\n     with them?\r\n\r\n      \"Being happily free from all real or imaginary personal interest\r\n     in the results of the enquiry thus set afoot, we should proceed\r\n     to weigh the arguments on one side and on the other, with as much\r\n     judicial calmness as if the question related to a new opossum.\r\n     We should endeavour to ascertain, without seeking either to\r\n     magnify or diminish them, all the characters by which our new\r\n     mammal differed from the apes; and if we found that these were of\r\n     less structural value than those which distinguish certain\r\n     members of the ape order from others universally admitted to be\r\n     of the same order, we should undoubtedly place the newly\r\n     discovered tellurian genus with them.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of this method, and taking the gorilla as the type for\r\nimmediate comparison with man, he passed in review the various\r\nanatomical structures, shewing that in every case man did not differ\r\nmore from the gorilla than that differed from other anthropoids. We\r\nshall take a few examples of his method and results, reminding our\r\nreaders, however, that Huxley carried his comparisons into every\r\nimportant part of the anatomical structure.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the skeleton so characteristically human as the\r\nbones which form the pelvis, or bony girdle of the hips. The expanded\r\nhaunch-bones form a basin-like structure which affords support to the\r\nsoft internal viscera during the habitually upright position, and\r\ngives space for the attachment of the very large muscles which help\r\nman to assume and support that attitude. In the gorilla this region\r\ndiffers considerably from that in man. The haunch-bones are narrower\r\nand much shallower, so that they do not form so convenient a\r\nsupporting basin; they have much less surface for the attachment of\r\nmuscles. The gibbon, however, differs more vastly from the gorilla\r\nthan that differs from man. The haunch-bones are flat and narrow, and\r\ntotally devoid of any basin-like formation; the passage through the\r\npelvis is long and narrow, and the ischia have outwardly curved\r\nprominences, which, in life, are coated by callosities on which the\r\nanimal habitually rests, and which are coarse, corn-like patches of\r\nskin wholly absent in the gorilla, in the chimpanzee, in the orang,\r\nand in man.\r\n\r\nIn the characters of the hands, the feet, and the brain, certain real\r\nor supposed structural distinctions between man and the apes had been\r\nrelied upon.\r\n\r\n     \"Man has been defined as the only animal possessed of two hands\r\n     terminating his fore-limbs, and of two feet terminating his\r\n     hind-limbs, while it has been said that all the apes possess four\r\n     hands; and he has been affirmed to differ fundamentally from all\r\n     the apes in the characters of his brain, which alone, it has been\r\n     strangely asserted and reasserted, exhibits the structures known\r\n     to anatomists as the posterior lobe, the posterior cornu of the\r\n     lateral ventricle, and the hippocampus minor.\r\n\r\n      \"That the former proposition should have gained general\r\n     acceptance is not surprising--indeed, at first sight, appearances\r\n     are much in its favour; but, as for the second, one can only\r\n     admire the surpassing courage of its enunciator, seeing that it\r\n     is an innovation which is not only opposed to generally and\r\n     justly accepted doctrines, but which is directly negatived by the\r\n     testimony of all original enquirers who have specially\r\n     investigated the matter; and that it has neither been, nor can\r\n     be, supported by a single anatomical preparation. It would, in\r\n     fact, be unworthy of serious refutation except for the general\r\n     and natural belief that deliberate and reiterated assertions must\r\n     have some foundation.\"\r\n\r\nThe last remarks referred, of course, to the statements of Owen, which\r\nhad made a great impression at the time and the result of which still\r\nlingers in some of the worse-informed treatises attacking evolution.\r\nHuxley gave a lucid account of the general structure and arrangement\r\nof the brain in the vertebrate series, explaining the well-known fact\r\nthat from fish up to man the general ground-plan of the brain is\r\nidentical, but that there is a progressive increase in the complexity\r\nand in the size of some parts compared with others. Next, he showed\r\nthat, so far from its being possible to erect any barrier in the\r\nstructure of the brain between man and the apes, there exists among\r\nthe mammals an almost complete series of gradations from brains a\r\nlittle higher than that of the rabbit to brains a little lower than\r\nthat of man. He laid great stress on\r\n\r\n     \"the remarkable circumstance that though, so far as our present\r\n     knowledge extends, there _is_ one structural break in the series\r\n     of forms of simian brains, this hiatus does not lie between man\r\n     and the man-like apes, but between the lower and the lowest\r\n     simians; or, in other words, between the old-and new-world apes\r\n     and monkeys, and the lemurs. Every lemur which has yet been\r\n     examined, in fact, has its cerebellum partially visible from\r\n     above, and its posterior lobe, with the contained posterior cornu\r\n     and hippocampus minor, more or less rudimentary. Every marmoset,\r\n     American monkey, old-world monkey, baboon, or man-like ape, on\r\n     the contrary, has its cerebellum entirely hidden, posteriorly, by\r\n     the cerebral lobes, and possesses a large posterior cornu, with a\r\n     well-developed hippocampus minor.\" ... \"So far from the posterior\r\n     lobe, the posterior cornu, and the hippocampus minor being\r\n     structures peculiar to, and characteristic of man, as they have\r\n     over and over again been asserted to be, even after the\r\n     publication of the clearest demonstration of the reverse, it is\r\n     precisely these structures which are the most marked cerebral\r\n     characters common to man with the apes. They are among the most\r\n     distinctly simian peculiarities which the human organism\r\n     exhibits.\" ... \"Man differs from the chimpanzee or the orang, so\r\n     far as cerebral structure goes, less than these do from the\r\n     monkeys, and the difference between the brains of the chimpanzee\r\n     and of man is almost insignificant, when compared with that\r\n     between the chimpanzee brain and that of a lemur.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Huxley found no structural differences between the brains of\r\nman and of anthropoid apes, he was careful to lay great stress on the\r\nimportant difference in size and weight. A full-grown gorilla is\r\nnearly twice as heavy as a European woman, and yet the heaviest known\r\ngorilla brain probably does not exceed twenty ounces in weight, while\r\nhealthy adult human brains probably never weigh less than thirty-one\r\nor thirty-two ounces. This difference is not of systematic importance;\r\nfor cranial capacities shew that relatively and absolutely there is a\r\ngreater difference in brain-weight between the lowest and highest\r\nhuman beings than there is between the highest ape and the lowest\r\nhuman being.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the suggestion that man differs from the apes in being\r\nbimanous, while the apes are quadrumanous, Huxley first explained and\r\ndiscussed what the exact differences between hands and feet are. He\r\nshewed that in man the foot is absolutely distinguished from the hand\r\nby three structural points, although the two organs are similar in\r\ngeneral ground-plan. These structural points are:\r\n\r\n1. The arrangement of the tarsal bones.\r\n\r\n2. The possession of a short flexor and short extensor muscle of the\r\ndigits.\r\n\r\n3. The possession of a muscle named _peronæus longus_.\r\n\r\nThen he described the foot of the gorilla, and shewed that although it\r\nwas superficially hand-like, it possessed all the structural\r\ncharacters that distinguish a foot from a hand. Tracing the structure\r\nof the foot downwards through the series of anthropoids and monkeys,\r\nhe established clearly that, while important differences existed in\r\nnearly every single creature, the differences between the gorilla and\r\nman were not greater than those between the gorilla and other\r\nanthropoids, and less than between the gorilla and lower monkeys.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful series of lectures ranks very high among the important\r\nworks of Huxley. It is true that a considerable proportion of the work\r\nwas not absolutely original, but it had all been specially verified by\r\nhim. It was a task undertaken with the greatest courage, and with a\r\ncare equal to the courage; and it settled conclusively for all time\r\nthe impossibility of making between man and the anthropoids any\r\nanatomical barriers greater than those which exist between the\r\ndifferent although closely related members of any of the other family\r\ngroups in the animal kingdom. The advance of knowledge has only added\r\nto the details of Huxley's argument; it has not made any\r\nreconstruction of it necessary. A writer on the same subject to-day\r\nwould to all certainty make use of the same general methods. The chief\r\ndifferences, perhaps, that would be made are two: First, greater\r\nstress would be laid on the distinction, first made by Huxley himself,\r\nbetween intermediate and linear types. (See p. 87). To use the popular\r\nphrase, a great deal of water has passed under the bridges since the\r\nseparation of man from the ape-like progenitors common to him and to\r\nthe existing anthropoids. It has already been pointed out that the\r\ngradual extinction of lower races of man is widening the apparent gap\r\nbetween existing man and existing apes; and evidence accumulates that\r\nmany still more primitive and more ape-like races of man than the\r\nlowest existing savages have disappeared from the surface of the\r\nearth. Moreover, we know that existing anthropoids are the degenerate\r\nand scattered remnants of what was once a much more widely spread and\r\nmore important group. We have some reason for believing the contrary,\r\nand no reason for believing that the surviving anthropoids represent\r\nthe most man-like apes that have lived.\r\n\r\nThe second great point in which a modern writer would amend Huxley's\r\nstatement of the case is more purely anatomical. One result of\r\nDarwin's work has been that anatomists attend much more closely to the\r\nslight variations of anatomical structure to be found among\r\nindividuals of the same species. A comparison between an individual\r\nhuman body and the body of an individual gorilla is not now considered\r\nsufficient. The comparison must be made between the results of\r\ndissection of a very large number of men and of a very large number of\r\ngorillas. The anatomy of a type is not the anatomy of an individual;\r\nit is a kind of central point around which there oscillate the\r\nvariations presented by the individuals belonging to the type. So far\r\nas this newer method has been applied, it has been found that the\r\nvariations of the gorilla type frequently, in the case of individual\r\norgans, overlap the variations of the human type, and that the\r\nstructure of man differs from the structure of any anthropoid type\r\nonly in that the abstract central point of its variations is slightly\r\ndifferent from the abstract central point of the variations presented\r\nby individual orangs, gorillas, and chimpanzees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AS A BRANCH OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\n     Science-Teaching Fifty Years Ago--Huxley's Insistence on\r\n     Reform--Science Primers--Physiography--Elementary\r\n     Physiology--_The Crayfish_--Manuals of Anatomy--Modern\r\n     Microscopical Methods--Practical Work in Biological\r\n     Teaching--Invention of the Type System--Science in Medical\r\n     Education--Science and Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nLess than half a century ago, there was practically no generally\r\ndiffused knowledge of even the elements of science and practically no\r\nprovision for teaching it. Medical students, in the course of their\r\nprofessional education, received some small instruction in botany,\r\nchemistry, and physiology; in the greater universities of England and\r\nthe Continent there were not in all a dozen professorships of science\r\napart from special branches of medicine; in the Scottish universities\r\nthere were one or two dreamy chairs of \"Natural and Civil History,\"\r\nthe occupiers of which were supposed to dispense instruction in half a\r\ndozen sciences. There was no scientific teaching at the public\r\nschools; there were practically no books available for beginners in\r\nscience, and even the idea of guides to laboratory work had not been\r\ninvented. Huxley, addressing in 1854 a particularly select audience in\r\nSt. Martin's Hall, London, spoke to them of the\r\n\r\n     \"utter ignorance as to the simplest laws of their own animal\r\n     life, which prevails among even the most highly educated persons\r\n     in this country.\" \"I am addressing,\" he said, \"I imagine, an\r\n     audience of cultivated persons; and yet I dare venture to assert\r\n     that, with the exception of those of my hearers who may chance to\r\n     have received a medical education, there is not one who could\r\n     tell me what is the meaning and use of an act which he performs a\r\n     score of times every minute, and whose suspension would involve\r\n     his immediate death:--I mean the act of breathing--or who could\r\n     state in precise terms why it is that a confined atmosphere is\r\n     injurious to health.\"\r\n\r\nThe power to express the precise meaning of even a common\r\nphysiological act is probably not yet possessed by all educated\r\npeople: but no one can doubt that there is now a very generally\r\ndiffused knowledge of and interest in the ordinary processes of living\r\nbodies. It is almost impossible for any of us to escape some amount of\r\nscientific education at school, at college, from lectures, or from\r\nbooks. Certainly those of us who have a natural inclination towards\r\nknowledge of that kind can hardly fail to have the opportunity of\r\nacquiring it. Every library abounds in elementary and advanced\r\nscientific books; every university and many schools have their\r\nlectures and laboratories for science, and there is scientific\r\nteaching involved in every educational curriculum. To attempt a\r\ncomplete account of how this radical change in the attitude of the\r\nworld to science has come about would be to attempt to write the\r\nhistory of European civilisation in the last half-century. A thousand\r\ncauses have been contributory; but among these causes two have been of\r\nextraordinary importance--an idea and a man. The idea is the\r\nconception of organic evolution, and the man was Huxley. The idea of\r\nevolution clothed the dead bones of anatomy with a fair and living\r\nflesh, and the new body left the dusty corners of museums to pervade\r\nthe world, arousing the attention and interest of all. A large part of\r\nthe prodigious mental activities of Huxley was devoted to compelling\r\nthe world to take an interest in biological science. Had his life-work\r\nbeen no more than this side of it, it would have been of commanding\r\nimportance. A mere enumeration of the modes in which he assisted in\r\narousing attention to science among all classes would fill many pages.\r\nAlmost before he was settled in London, in the lecture from which we\r\nquoted at the beginning of this chapter he urged the \"educational\r\nvalue of the natural history sciences.\" In 1869 in a speech in\r\nLiverpool; in 1870 at University College, London; in 1874 as his\r\nRectorial address in the University of Aberdeen; in 1876 at the\r\nopening ceremonial of the Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore; in\r\nthe same year at South Kensington; in 1877 in a separate essay; in\r\n1881 in an address to the International Medical Congress: at these\r\ndifferent times and addressing different and important audiences he\r\ncontinued to urge the absolute necessity of a knowledge of nature. A\r\nwell-known and eloquent passage from an address on \"a liberal\r\neducation\" delivered to working men in 1868 contains the gist of his\r\nreiterated argument:\r\n\r\n     \"Suppose it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune of\r\n     every one of us would, one day or other, depend on his winning or\r\n     losing a game of chess, don't you think that we should all\r\n     consider it to be a primary duty to learn at least the names and\r\n     the moves of the pieces; to have a notion of a gambit, and a keen\r\n     eye for all the means of giving and getting out of check? Do you\r\n     not think that we should look with a disapprobation amounting to\r\n     scorn upon the father who allowed his son, or the state which\r\n     allowed its members, to grow up without knowing a pawn from a\r\n     knight?\r\n\r\n     Yet it is a very plain and elementary truth, that the life, the\r\n     fortune, and the happiness of every one of us, and more or less\r\n     of those who are connected with us, do depend upon our knowing\r\n     something of the rules of a game infinitely more difficult and\r\n     complicated than chess. It is a game which has been played for\r\n     untold ages, every man and woman of us being one of the two\r\n     players in a game of his or her own. The chess-board is the\r\n     world, the pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of\r\n     the game are what we call the laws of nature. The player on the\r\n     other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is always\r\n     fair, just, and patient. But also we know, to our cost, that he\r\n     never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for\r\n     ignorance. To the man who plays well, the highest stakes are\r\n     paid, with that sort of overflowing generosity with which the\r\n     strong shows delight in strength, and one who plays ill is\r\n     checkmated--without haste, but without remorse.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley wished that this scientific education should begin at an early\r\nperiod of every child's training. In 1869 he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Let every child be instructed in those general views of the\r\n     phænomena of nature for which we have no exact English name. The\r\n     nearest approximation to a name for what I mean which we possess\r\n     is physical geography; the Germans have a better, 'Erdkunde'\r\n     (earth knowledge or geology in its etymological sense), that is\r\n     to say, a general knowledge of the earth, and what is on it and\r\n     in it and about it. If anyone who has experience of the ways of\r\n     young children will call to mind their questions, he will find\r\n     that so far as they can be put in any scientific category, they\r\n     will come under this head of 'Erdkunde.' The child asks, 'What is\r\n     the moon, and why does it shine?' 'What is this water, and where\r\n     does it run?' 'What is the wind?' 'What makes these waves in the\r\n     sea?' 'Where does this animal live, and what is the use of that\r\n     plant?' And if not snubbed and stunted by being told not to ask\r\n     foolish questions, there is no limit to the intellectual craving\r\n     of a young child; nor any bounds to the slow but solid accretion\r\n     of knowledge and development of the thinking faculty in this way.\r\n     To all such questions, answers which are necessarily incomplete,\r\n     though true as far as they go, may be given by any teacher whose\r\n     ideas represent real knowledge and not mere book learning: and a\r\n     panoramic view of nature, accompanied by a strong infusion of the\r\n     scientific habit of mind, may thus be placed within the reach of\r\n     every child of nine or ten.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Huxley, in association with Professor Roscoe, the chemist, and\r\nProfessor Balfour Stewart, the physicist, took a great practical step\r\ntoward securing the widest possible extension of elementary knowledge\r\nin science. They became general editors, for the English publishing\r\nhouse of Macmillan, of a series of \"Science Primers.\" These were\r\nwritten in simple language, suitable for those with no preliminary\r\nknowledge of science, but were the work of the chief authorities in\r\nthe leading branches of science. They were published at what was then\r\nthe phenomenally cheap price of a shilling, and they sold in almost\r\nincredible numbers. Huxley himself wrote the introductory volume to\r\nthis great series of tracts, taking for his subject the simplest and\r\nmost natural phenomena of the world and the simplest chains of cause\r\nand effect that can be observed around us. The keynote of the little\r\nbook was that knowledge of nature could be gained only by observation\r\nand experiment, and that for these the ordinary things in the world\r\naround us provided ample material. A few years later he wrote a more\r\nadvanced volume on the same subject. He had now found an English name\r\nfor the German _Erdkunde_, and his book on _Physiography_ was simply\r\nan account of the leading things and forces of nature. A traveller\r\nset down in a foreign land will at once get into difficulties unless\r\nhe has provided himself with a guide to the geography, the manners and\r\ncustoms, and the regulations of the country in which he finds himself.\r\nHuxley's aim was to provide a similar guide to nature; an outline of\r\nelementary knowledge of the world into which we all come as strangers.\r\nHe wrote of force and energy, of the forms of water, of heat and cold,\r\nof the atmosphere, of winds and tides and weather, and of the main\r\nfeatures of the lives of plants and animals. There was nothing new in\r\nwhat he wrote; he simply took from the chief sciences their leading\r\nprinciples and elementary facts, and set them forth in plain and\r\nsimple language so that all could read and understand. The novelty was\r\nthat an attempt should be made to bring these facts within the reach\r\nof all. The idea proved extremely infectious; in Europe and America,\r\nin many languages and by many authors, Huxley's main lines were\r\nfollowed, with the result that a new branch of education, and almost\r\nof science, was created.\r\n\r\nThe body of man and the processes of life, in the earlier part of the\r\ncentury, were almost as unknown to most people as were the structure of\r\nthe earth and the great processes of nature. What was known of human\r\nanatomy and physiology was contained in ponderous treatises, written in\r\ndifficult and technical language suitable only for students of medicine\r\nand doctors. It was thought to be not only unnecessary but slightly\r\ncoarse for those not in the profession to know anything of the viscera\r\nof digestion, circulation, and so forth. Huxley laid low this great\r\nsuperstition by his _Elementary Lessons in Physiology_, a little volume\r\nfirst published in 1866, which ran through many editions. In it he wrote\r\nprimarily for teachers and learners in boys' and girls' schools, and\r\nselected from the great bulk of knowledge and opinion called human\r\nphysiology only the important and well-established truths. So successful\r\nwas he in his selection that, notwithstanding the immense increase in\r\nknowledge since he wrote, the book still remains an adequate and useful\r\nelementary treatise, and by this time must have given their main\r\nknowledge of the human body to hundreds and thousands of readers who\r\notherwise would have remained ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe books of which we have been writing were addressed to the general\r\npublic, but, in addition, Huxley wrote several, of which three are\r\nspecially important, for those students who devote themselves\r\nspecially to anatomy. _The Crayfish_, his famous volume in the\r\nInternational Scientific Series, has been called by Professor Howes,\r\nthe assistant and successor of Huxley at the Royal College of Science,\r\n\"probably the best biological treatise ever written.\" Many naturalists\r\nhave written elaborate monographs on single animals: Lyonet worked for\r\nyears on the willow caterpillar, Strauss Durckheim devoted an even\r\nminuter attention to the common cockchafer, and the great Bojanus\r\ninvestigated almost every fibre in the structure of the tortoise. The\r\nvolumes produced by these anatomists were valuable and memorable, and\r\noccupy an honoured place in the library of science, but Huxley's aim\r\nwas wider and greater. He showed how careful study of one of the\r\ncommonest and most insignificant of animals leads, step by step, from\r\nevery-day knowledge to the widest generalisations and the most\r\ndifficult problems of zoölogy. He made study of a single creature an\r\nintroduction to a whole science, and taught students to regard any\r\nform of life not merely as a highly complicated and deeply interesting\r\nanatomical study, but as a creature that is only one out of an\r\ninnumerable host of living things, every fibre in its body, every\r\nrhythm in its functions proclaiming the degree and nature of its\r\nrelationship to other animals. R. Louis Stevenson, writing of his\r\nnative town, tried to give \"a vision of Edinburgh, not as you see her,\r\nin the midst of a little neighbourhood, but as a boss upon the round\r\nworld, with all Europe and the deep sea for her surroundings. For\r\nevery place is a centre to the earth, whence highways radiate, or\r\nships set sail for foreign ports; the limit of a parish is not more\r\nimaginary than the frontier of an empire.\" It is this wider sweep,\r\nthis attempt to see and to teach not merely the facts about things but\r\nthe relations of these facts to the similar facts in other things,\r\nthat makes the difference between the new knowledge and the old. The\r\nquestions to be asked and answered are not merely, What are the\r\nstructures in this animal? but, How and why do they come to be what\r\nthey are? Huxley was a ruthless enemy of the books and teachers which\r\nor who made the mere acquisition of details of knowledge their chief\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n     \"I remember,\" he wrote, \"in my youth there were detestable books\r\n     which ought to have been burned by the hands of the common\r\n     hangman, for they contained questions and answers to be learned\r\n     by heart, of this sort, 'What is a horse? The horse is termed\r\n     _Equus caballus_; belongs to the class Mammalia; order,\r\n     Pachydermata; family, Solidungula.' Was any human being the wiser\r\n     for learning that magic formula? Was he not more foolish inasmuch\r\n     as he was deluded into taking words for knowledge?\"\r\n\r\nHuxley himself admitted his difficulty in remembering apparently\r\nmeaningless facts, and occasionally aided his memory by inventing for\r\nthem a humorous significance. Professor Howes relates a story of this\r\nkind. While examining the papers of candidates for some examination,\r\nHuxley came across one in which the mitral or bicuspid valve of the\r\nheart was erroneously described as being placed in the right cavity.\r\n\"Poor little beggar,\" said Huxley; \"I never could get them myself\r\nuntil I reflected that a bishop could never be in the right.\" This\r\ninsistence on the uselessness of formal knowledge applied only to\r\nthose who were being taught or who were learning from books or\r\nlectures. Of the value and discipline of knowledge of facts gained at\r\nfirst hand from objects themselves either in original investigation or\r\nwith the aid of books, Huxley had the highest possible opinion. By\r\nsuch a method of work alone he believed it possible to distinguish\r\nwhat we believe on authority from what we have convinced ourselves to\r\nbe true, and, as we shall see later, he regarded it as the most\r\nimportant duty of a man to have acquired the habit of classifying the\r\nmass of ideas in his brain into those which he knew and those which he\r\nthought to be true from having read or heard or imagined them.\r\n\r\nThe two other of the three great treatises for anatomical students are\r\nthe _Manual of the Anatomy of Vertebrated Animals_, published in 1871,\r\nand the _Manual of the Anatomy of Invertebrated Animals_, published in\r\n1877. Of these two volumes it is sufficient to say that they formed\r\nthe chief introduction to the study of animal zoölogy for many years,\r\nand that a large number of the best-known zoölogists of the end of\r\nthis century received from them their first instruction in the\r\nscience. As text-books they have been superseded lately by larger\r\nvolumes in which there is found more space for some of the recent\r\nadvances in knowledge, especially comparative embryology, and the more\r\nintricate knowledge of the structure of the soft parts of marine\r\ninvertebrates made possible by the newer and more successful methods\r\nof preserving delicate tissues. Just before Huxley ceased his regular\r\nwork as a teacher at the Royal College of Science, there arrived a\r\nseries of marine embryos, beautifully preserved and prepared for\r\nmicroscopic work by the zoölogists at the International Zoölogical\r\nStation at Naples. Huxley is reported to have exclaimed at their\r\nbeauty, and to have said: \"You young men cannot realise your\r\nadvantages; you have brought to you for study at your leisure in\r\nLondon, creatures that I had to lash my microscope to the mast to get\r\na glimpse of.\" Huxley's books were written for students with fewer\r\nadvantages, and, naturally, laid more stress on the harder skeletal\r\nparts and such structures as could be more easily preserved; but with\r\nthis inevitable limitation they still serve as luminous and\r\ncomprehensive guides to the subjects of which they treat. There is no\r\ndoubt but that if he had been a younger man when the new technical\r\nmethods made their appearance, he would have adopted them and their\r\nresults in his volumes. One of the first great pieces of work which\r\nutilised methods more like those now used in all laboratories than\r\nthose employed during the greater part of Huxley's life as a teacher\r\nwas the classical investigation by Van Beneden into the changes in the\r\negg of Ascaris which accompany the process of fertilisation. When\r\nHuxley read the memoir he exclaimed, \"All this by the use of glacial\r\nacetic acid--is it possible!\" At once, Professor Howes relates, he\r\nrepeated the whole investigation himself, and, when satisfied,\r\ndeclared that the \"history of the histological investigation of the\r\nfuture would be the history of its methods.\" Not only have the\r\nchemical substances used in preparing tissues for examination greatly\r\nincreased since Huxley's time as an active worker, but a very\r\nimportant method of investigation has come into general use. In\r\nHuxley's time tissues or animals too large or too opaque to be\r\nexamined microscopically as whole structures were either teased by\r\nneedles or were cut with a razor by hand into comparatively thick\r\nslices. The process of cutting, however practised the operator, was\r\ntedious and uncertain, and it was almost impossible to cut a piece of\r\ntissue into a series of thin slices without losing or destroying\r\nconsiderable portions. Microtomes, with various accessory mechanical\r\nappliances, have now been invented, and by means of these not only are\r\nslices of great tenuity made with ease, but there is little difficulty\r\nin cutting the most delicate organism into a ribbon of consecutive\r\nslices. Such new methods have made almost a revolution in the study of\r\nzoölogy, particularly of the lower forms of life and of the embryonic\r\nstages of higher animals, and books written before these methods\r\nbecame common have naturally been superseded.\r\n\r\nHuxley did far more for the teaching of science than the preparation\r\nof books, however useful these were. He was the practical inventor of\r\nthe laboratory system of teaching zoölogical science, and all over the\r\nworld the methods invented by him have been adopted in university\r\nlaboratories and technical schools. He had always declared that since\r\nzoölogy was a physical science, the method of studying it must needs\r\nbe analogous to that which is followed in other physical sciences. If\r\na man wishes to be a chemist, it is necessary not only that he should\r\nread chemical books and attend chemical lectures, but that he should\r\nactually perform the fundamental experiments in the laboratory for\r\nhimself, and thus learn exactly what the words which he reads in his\r\nbooks and hears from his teachers, mean. \"If you want a man to be a\r\ntea-merchant, you don't tell him to read books about China or about\r\ntea, but you put him into a tea-merchant's office where he has the\r\nhandling, the smelling, and the tasting of tea. Without the sort of\r\nknowledge which can be gained only in this practical way, his exploits\r\nas a tea-merchant will soon come to a bankrupt termination.\" The great\r\nand obvious difficulty in the practical teaching of biology appeared\r\nto be the immense number of different kinds of animals and plants in\r\nexistence. A human life would not suffice for the examination of a\r\nhundredth part of these. Huxley met the difficulty by the \"type\"\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n     \"There are certainly more than 100,000 species of insects, and\r\n     yet anyone who knows one insect, if a properly chosen one, will\r\n     be able to have a fair conception of the structure of the whole.\r\n     I do not mean to say he will know that structure thoroughly, or\r\n     as well as is desirable that he should know it; but he will have\r\n     enough real knowledge to enable him to understand what he reads,\r\n     to have genuine images in his mind of these structures which\r\n     become so variously modified in all the forms of insects he has\r\n     not seen. In fact, there are such things as types of form among\r\n     animals and vegetables, and for the purpose of getting a definite\r\n     knowledge of what constitutes the leading modifications of animal\r\n     and plant life, it is not needful to examine more than a\r\n     comparatively small number of animals and plants.\"\r\n\r\nThe type system in itself was not absolutely new. Rolleston, the\r\nLinacre professor at Oxford, in his _Forms of Animal Life_ had\r\ndevised the method of teaching comparative anatomy by the study of a\r\ngraded series of animals. But his method depended on the existence of\r\na series of dissections and preparations made by a skilled craftsman;\r\nthe tradition of teaching by authority instead of by investigation was\r\nmaintained, although the authority of books and lectures was aided by\r\nmuseum specimens in glass bottles, the actual basis of the book being\r\na series of dissections prepared by Mr. Charles Robertson, Rolleston's\r\nlaboratory assistant, for the great International Exhibition of 1861.\r\nThe authorities of Huxley's students were to be found in nature\r\nitself. The green scum from the nearest gutter, a handful of weed from\r\na pond, a bean-plant, some fresh-water mud, a frog, and a pigeon were\r\nthe ultimate authorities of his course. His students were taught how\r\nto observe them, and how to draw and record their observations.\r\nHowever familiar the objects, each student had to verify every fact\r\nafresh for himself. The business of the teacher was explanation of the\r\nmethods of verification, insistence on the accomplishment of\r\nverification. It was a training in the immemorial attitude of the\r\nscientific mind, codified by Huxley and made an integral part in\r\nnational education.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact it was comparatively late in his life as a teacher\r\nthat Huxley had complete opportunity for putting into practice his\r\nscheme for the laboratory teaching of biology. In 1854 there was no\r\nlaboratory attached to the Natural History Department of the School of\r\nMines. Lectures alone were given, and the only opportunity the student\r\nhad of any practical acquaintance with the facts was in a short\r\ninterview with the professor at the lecture table after the lecture.\r\nThis condition continued practically to 1872. But a few years before\r\nthat Huxley and his colleagues got up a kind of pronunciamento\r\ndeploring the existing state of affairs. In his evidence before the\r\nRoyal Commission of 1870 Huxley said: \"There is a complete want in the\r\nSchool of Mines, as it now exists, of any means of teaching several of\r\nthe subjects practically. For example, I am set there to teach natural\r\nhistory without a biological laboratory and without the means of\r\nshewing a single dissection.\" Against strong internal opposition and\r\nat considerable pecuniary loss Huxley and some of his colleagues\r\nsucceeded, in 1872, in getting the School of Mines transferred to\r\nSouth Kensington, where it became the Royal College of Science. For\r\nthe first course of instruction given in the new buildings, Huxley\r\nobtained the aid of Prof. M. Foster, Prof. Rutherford, and Prof. Ray\r\nLankester. The laboratory course originated by Huxley and shaped by\r\nhim with these three distinguished assistants became the model of the\r\nregular courses given subsequently, and, with various slight\r\nmodifications, has since been adopted almost universally. Later on,\r\nHuxley described it as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I lecture to a class of students daily for about four months and\r\n     a half, and my class have, of course, their text-books; but the\r\n     essential part of the whole teaching, and that which I regard as\r\n     really the most important part of it, is a laboratory for\r\n     practical work, which is simply a room with all the appliances\r\n     needed for ordinary dissection. We have tables properly arranged\r\n     in regard to light, microscopes and dissecting instruments, and\r\n     we work through the structure of a certain number of plants and\r\n     animals. As, for example, among the plants we take the\r\n     yeast-plant, a Protococcus, a common mould, a Chara, a fern, and\r\n     some flowering plant; among animals we examine such things as an\r\n     Amoeba, a Vorticella, and a fresh-water polyp. We dissect a\r\n     starfish, an earthworm, a snail, a squid, and a fresh-water\r\n     mussel. We examine a lobster and a crayfish, and a black beetle.\r\n     We go on to a common skate, a codfish, a frog, a tortoise, a\r\n     pigeon, and a rabbit, and that takes us about all the time we\r\n     have to give. The purpose of this course is not to make skilled\r\n     dissectors, but to give every student a clear and definite\r\n     conception, by means of sense images, of the characteristic\r\n     structure of each of the leading modifications of the animal\r\n     kingdom; and that is perfectly possible by going no further than\r\n     the length of that list of forms which I have enumerated. If a\r\n     man knows the structure of the animals I have mentioned, he has a\r\n     clear and exact, however limited apprehension of the essential\r\n     features of the organization of all those great divisions of the\r\n     animal and vegetable kingdoms to which the forms I have mentioned\r\n     severally belong. And it then becomes possible to him to read\r\n     with profit; because every time he meets with the name of a\r\n     structure, he has a definite image in his mind of what the name\r\n     means in the particular creature he is reading about, and\r\n     therefore the reading is not mere reading. It is not mere\r\n     repetition of words; but every term employed in the description,\r\n     we will say of a horse, or of an elephant, will call up the image\r\n     of the things he had seen in the rabbit, and he is able to form a\r\n     distinct conception of that which he has not seen, as a\r\n     modification of that which he has seen.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley himself was originally a medical man; all through his life he\r\nwas chiefly interested in the biological sciences which underlie a\r\nscientific practice of medicine, and as teacher and examiner he had\r\nmuch to do with the shaping of medical education in London. Acting in\r\nvarious public capacities, as a member of commissions dealing with\r\nmedical education, or as a witness before them, in magazine articles\r\nand in public speeches he made many contributions to the problems to\r\nbe faced in medical education. Some of these related to the conditions\r\npeculiar to medical training in London. In the greatest city of the\r\nworld there was during Huxley's life and there is still nothing\r\ncomparable with the great universities of Europe and America, of\r\nScotland and Ireland. Some dozen hospitals, supported partly by\r\nendowments, partly by charities, attempt each to maintain a complete,\r\nindependent medical school. As the requirements of medical education\r\nin staff, laboratories, and general equipment has advanced, these\r\nhospitals have made heroic efforts to advance with them.\r\nNotwithstanding the zeal and public spirit of the staff and managers\r\nof the hospitals, this want of system has naturally resulted in a\r\nmultiplication of inefficient institutions and a number of makeshift\r\narrangements. Huxley repeatedly urged the concentration of all this\r\ndiffuse effort into a few centres, but this inevitable reform has not\r\nyet become possible.\r\n\r\nA second important consideration, and one that has a much wider\r\napplication, relates to the kind of person by whom the scientific\r\nsides of medical teaching should be given. Primitively, all the\r\ninstruction to medical students was given by those actually engaged in\r\nthe practice of medicine. Huxley was strongly of the opinion that the\r\nteachers of anatomy, physiology, chemistry, and so forth, should be\r\nspecialists devoted to these subjects for life, and not merely\r\nsurgeons and physicians who engaged in teaching until their practice\r\ngrew sufficiently to monopolise their attention.\r\n\r\n     \"I get every year,\" he said, \"the elaborate reports of Henle and\r\n     Meissner--volumes of I suppose 400 pages altogether--and they\r\n     consist merely of abstracts of the memoirs and works which have\r\n     been written on Anatomy and Physiology--only abstracts of them.\r\n     How is a man to keep up his acquaintance with all that is doing\r\n     in the physiological world--in a world advancing with enormous\r\n     strides every day and every hour--if he has to be distracted with\r\n     the cares of practice?\"\r\n\r\nThere would always be found men, he declared, who would make the\r\nchoice between the wealth which may come by successful practice and a\r\nmodest competency, when that modest competency was to be combined with\r\na scientific career and the means of advancing knowledge. It was to\r\nthose who made the latter choice that he would entrust the teaching of\r\nthe sciences underlying medicine; partly because from the mere\r\nmechanical reason of time these men would be better able to keep pace\r\nwith the most recent advances in knowledge, and partly because their\r\nteaching would be stimulated by their own work in advancing knowledge.\r\nIn this great matter the world is rapidly advancing towards the\r\nstandard of Huxley; as each new appointment is made it becomes more\r\nand more probable that the man chosen will be a teacher and\r\ninvestigator rather than a practitioner.\r\n\r\nIn another general question of the politics of medical education\r\nHuxley took a strong line, and the tendency of change is toward his\r\nview. One of the first results of the awakening of medical education\r\nin the middle of this century was a tendency to throw an almost\r\nintolerable burden of new subjects upon the medical student. In the\r\nrevolt from the old apprenticeship system, in which the student, from\r\nthe very first, gave his chief attention to practice, and was left\r\nalmost to himself to pick up a scanty knowledge of the principles and\r\ntheories underlying his profession, the pendulum swung too far the\r\nother way, and there was almost no branch of the biological and\r\nphysical sciences in which he was not expected to go through a severe\r\ntraining. On the old system the greater part of his time was spent in\r\nthe wards of the hospital; on the new system it was only at an\r\nadvanced stage of his career that he entered the wards at all, a\r\ngreat part of his time and energy being spent in the purely scientific\r\nteaching of the medical college. Huxley, although he had largely aided\r\nin the overthrow of the happy-go-lucky older system, of which Mr. Bob\r\nSawyer was no exaggerated type, was equally severe on the reckless\r\nextensions of the new system. \"If I were a despot,\" he said, \"I would\r\ncut down the theoretical branches to a very considerable extent.\" He\r\nwould discard comparative anatomy and botany, materia medica, and\r\nchemistry and physics, except as applied to physiology, from the\r\nmedical student's course. At first sight, this seems a hard saying,\r\nbut it is to be remembered that at that time the normal curriculum of\r\na medical student lasted only four years, a space of time barely\r\nsufficient for the necessary minimum of purely medical and surgical\r\nwork. Huxley's view was that chemistry and physics, botany and\r\nzoölogy, should be part of the general education, not of the special\r\nmedical education; he wished students to spend one or two years after\r\ntheir ordinary career at school in work on these elementary scientific\r\nsubjects, and then to begin their medical course free from the burden\r\nof extra-professional subjects. With certain limits due to the\r\ndifferent local conditions in different teaching centres Huxley's\r\nsystem is being adopted. In most cases the authorities in medical\r\neducation are unable to leave the whole responsibility of the\r\nelementary education in science to the schools from which medical\r\nstudents come, as the conditions under which scientific subjects are\r\nstill taught in schools leave much to be desired. The average length\r\nof the medical curriculum has been extended and the elementary\r\nscientific subjects are taken first, sometimes at the medical\r\ncolleges, sometimes in the scientific departments of universities.\r\nThe interesting general point of view is that Huxley, although himself\r\na biologist and teacher of biology, took too broad an outlook on the\r\ngeneral policy of education to insist upon his own subject to the\r\ndetriment of the precise practical objects of the training of medical\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Huxley's greatest activity, while by the natural force\r\nof events and by his special efforts science was becoming more and\r\nmore recognised as a necessary and important branch of general\r\neducation, the cry was raised against it that scientific education was\r\nnot capable of giving what is called culture. A scientific man was\r\nregarded as a mere scientific specialist, and science was considered\r\nto have no place in, and in fact to be an enemy of, \"liberal\r\neducation.\" In 1880, at Birmingham, Huxley attacked this view in a\r\nspeech delivered at the opening of the Mason College. Sir Josiah\r\nMason, the benevolent founder of that great institution, had made it\r\none of the conditions of the foundation that the College should make\r\nno provision for \"mere literary instruction and education.\" This gave\r\nHuxley a text for raising the whole question of the relation of\r\nscience to culture. He declared that he held very strongly by two\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\n     \"The first is, that neither the discipline nor the subject matter\r\n     of classical education is of such direct value to the student of\r\n     physical science as to justify the expenditure of valuable time\r\n     on either; and the second is, that for the purpose of attaining\r\n     real culture, an exclusively scientific education is at least as\r\n     effectual as an exclusively literary education.\"\r\n\r\nHe quoted from Matthew Arnold, then in the zenith of his fame as a\r\nchief apostle of culture, and shewed that there were two propositions\r\ninvolved in the \"literary\" view of culture. The first was that a\r\n\"criticism of life\" was the essence of culture; the second, that\r\nliterature contained the materials which sufficed for the construction\r\nof such a criticism. With the first proposition he had no dispute,\r\ntaking the view that culture was something quite different from\r\nlearning or technical skill. \"It implies the possession of an ideal,\r\nand the habit of critically estimating the value of things by\r\ncomparison with a theoretic standard. Perfect culture should supply a\r\ncomplete theory of life, based upon a clear knowledge alike of its\r\npossibilities and its limitations.\" Against the second proposition he\r\nurged in the first place that it was self-evident that after having\r\nlearned all that Greek, Roman, and Eastern antiquity have thought and\r\nsaid, and all that modern literature has to tell us, it was still\r\nnecessary to have a deeper foundation for criticism of life. An\r\nacquaintance with what physical science had done, particularly in\r\nlater years, was as necessary to criticism of life as any of the\r\nliterary materials. Next, following the biological habit of examining\r\nanything by studying its development, he shewed how the connection\r\nbetween \"culture\" and study of classical literature had come into\r\nexistence. For many centuries Latin grammar, with logic and rhetoric,\r\nstudied through Latin, were the fundamentals of education. A liberal\r\neducation was possible only through study of the language in which all\r\nor nearly all the materials for it were written. With the changes\r\nproduced by the Renascence there came a battle between Latin and\r\nGreek, and Greek came to be part of a liberal education. Later on,\r\nthere came a similar battle between the classical and modern\r\nlanguages, and now the modern languages have included and absorbed\r\nall the necessary material for knowledge and criticism. Those who\r\ncling to classics as the basis of culture and education are clinging\r\nto old weapons long after these have ceased to be effective, simply\r\nbecause at one time in history only these weapons were available in\r\nthe struggle for knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nGENERAL PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\n     Establishment of Compulsory Education in England--The Religious\r\n     Controversy--Huxley Advocates the Bible without Theology--His\r\n     Compromise on the \"Cowper-Temple\" Clause--Influence of the New\r\n     Criticism--Science and Art Instruction--Training of\r\n     Teachers--University Education--The Baltimore Address--Technical\r\n     Education--So-called \"Applied Science\"--National Systems of\r\n     Education as \"Capacity-Catchers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter, the special relation of Huxley to scientific\r\neducation was described, and, naturally enough, it is in special\r\nconnection with scientific education that his influence is best known.\r\nBut he was keenly interested in all the larger problems of general,\r\nuniversity, and technical education, and he played a great part in\r\nshaping the lines upon which these problems have been solved in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately before 1870, all England was wrestling with\r\nthe great problem of elementary education, in the arrangements for\r\nwhich it was far behind not only the leading European countries but\r\neven its sister-kingdom, Scotland. In 1870 there came into operation\r\nan Act of Parliament for the regulation of elementary education under\r\nthe supervision of locally elected school boards. Hitherto elementary\r\neducation had been controlled by the Established Church, and by other\r\ndenominational religious bodies, and the quality and quantity of the\r\ninstruction provided, for financial and various other reasons, had\r\nbeen extremely unsatisfactory. But a long and furious battle had raged\r\naround the religious question; elementary education was now to be\r\nnational, compulsory, and universal; where religious bodies maintained\r\nschools that complied with certain fixed standards of efficiency,\r\nattendance of children at these was to be regarded as satisfactory,\r\nand in addition to the ordinary subjects, such theological and\r\nreligious teaching as the supporting bodies chose might be added. But\r\nin the schools for all and sundry, under the control of boards\r\nrepresenting the whole population, and deriving that part of their\r\nincome represented by the subscriptions of the religious bodies in the\r\ndenominational schools from public rates, levied on the whole\r\npopulation, was any definite creed to be inculcated? The extreme\r\nChurch party, perhaps naturally, held that the creed established by\r\nlaw in the land should be taught in these new schools; extreme\r\nsupporters of other creeds, and a majority of ordinary people of all\r\ncreeds or of no creeds, objected to a new establishment of a sectarian\r\ndoctrine, even though that sectarian doctrine were the doctrine of the\r\nnational religion. The final result of the dispute as codified in the\r\nAct of Parliament was what was known as the Cowper-Temple Clause: \"No\r\nreligious catechism or religious formulary which is distinctive of any\r\nparticular denomination shall be taught in the school.\" The actual\r\nvalue of any clause, however it may appear to be a fair compromise,\r\ndepends on the spirit in which it is practically interpreted, and no\r\nsooner had the Act been passed than the battle was renewed again over\r\nthe interpretation of the clause. Many of the Church controversialists\r\nheld that the liberal or more advanced party intended to exclude all\r\nreference to the Bible or to religion, on the plea that some sect\r\ncould be found to which the most attenuated expression of religion\r\nwould appear to be against the plain meaning of the clause, and\r\nHuxley, who had been in the forefront of the controversy, and who was\r\na candidate for the first London School Board, was decried as an enemy\r\nof the Bible and of all religion and morality because he had expressed\r\nwhat he called a secular interpretation of the clause. In an article\r\npublished in the _Contemporary Review_ immediately after the election,\r\nHuxley explained precisely what he took the clause to mean, and,\r\nafterwards, at all events during the existence of the Board to which\r\nhe was elected, succeeded in carrying out his intentions in the main.\r\n\r\nHis first general point was to deprecate the action of those\r\nextremists of both sides who tried to make the education of children a\r\nmere battle-ground of religious dogmas. He then laid down what he\r\nconceived to be the lines of most general utility upon which, under\r\nthe provisions of the Act, the education of children should be\r\nconducted. In the foreground he placed physical training and drill, as\r\nof supreme importance to young children, especially in the case of the\r\npoor children of large towns.\r\n\r\n     \"All the conditions of the lives of such are unfavourable to\r\n     their physical well-being. They are badly lodged, badly housed,\r\n     badly fed, and live from one year's end to another in bad air,\r\n     without a chance of a change. They have no play-grounds; they\r\n     amuse themselves with marbles and chuck-farthing, instead of\r\n     cricket and hare-and-hounds; and if it were not for the\r\n     wonderful instinct which leads all poor children of tender years\r\n     to throw themselves under the feet of cab-horses whenever they\r\n     can, I know not how they would learn to use their limbs with\r\n     agility.\"\r\n\r\nThis, humanitarianism as it was, was not the mere emotional sentiment\r\nof the typical humanitarian; he went on to give the soundest practical\r\nreasons for physical development.\r\n\r\n     \"Whatever doubts people may entertain about the efficacy of\r\n     natural selection, there can be none about artificial selection;\r\n     and the breeder who should attempt to make, or keep up, a fine\r\n     stock of pigs, or sheep, under the conditions to which the\r\n     children of the poor are exposed, would be the laughing stock\r\n     even of the bucolic mind. Parliament has already done something\r\n     in this direction by declining to be an accomplice in the\r\n     asphyxiation of school children. It refuses to make any grant to\r\n     a school in which the cubical contents of the school-room are\r\n     inadequate to allow of proper respiration.\"\r\n\r\nHe wished to see physical training put on the same system.\r\n\r\nThe second great point upon which he laid stress was the necessity of\r\nproviding training in domestic economy, cookery, and other household\r\naccomplishments, for poor girls. These demands of Huxley seem simple\r\nand obvious, now that by his efforts and the efforts of others they\r\nhave been accomplished, but in England, even thirty years ago, it\r\nrequired more than an ordinary prevision and boldness to insist upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHuxley passed next to the burning question of the time. He treated it\r\nin the broadest and least sectarian spirit.\r\n\r\n     \"The boys and girls for whose education the School Boards have to\r\n     provide, have not merely to discharge domestic duties, but each\r\n     of them is a member of a social and political organisation of\r\n     great complexity, and has, in future life, to fit himself into\r\n     that organisation, or be crushed by it. To this end it is surely\r\n     needful, not only that they should be made acquainted with the\r\n     elementary laws of conduct, but that their affections should be\r\n     trained, so as to love with all their hearts that conduct which\r\n     tends to the attainment of the highest good for themselves and\r\n     their fellow-men, and to hate with all their hearts that opposite\r\n     course of action which is fraught with evil.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to point out the distinction between the affection\r\nwhich is called religion, and the science which is called theology,\r\nand, without entering into the question as to whether the latter were\r\nor were not a true science, he insisted on the danger of a confusion\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\n     \"We are divided into two parties--the advocates of so-called\r\n     'religious' teaching on the one hand, and those of so-called\r\n     'secular' teaching on the other. And both parties seem to me to\r\n     be not only hopelessly wrong, but in such a position that if\r\n     either succeeded completely, it would discover, before many years\r\n     were over, that it had made a great mistake and done serious evil\r\n     to the cause of education. For, leaving aside the more far-seeing\r\n     minority on either side, what the religious party is crying for\r\n     is mere theology, under the name of religion; while the\r\n     secularists have unwisely and wrongfully admitted the assumption\r\n     of their opponents, and demand the abolition of all religious\r\n     teaching, when they only want to be free of theology--burning\r\n     your ship to get rid of the cockroaches.\" ... \"If I were\r\n     compelled to choose for one of my own children, between a school\r\n     in which real religious instruction is given, and one without it,\r\n     I should prefer the former, even though the child might have to\r\n     take a good deal of theology with it. Nine-tenths of a dose of\r\n     bark is mere half-rotten wood; but one swallows it for the sake\r\n     of the particles of quinine, the beneficial effect of which may\r\n     be weakened, but is not destroyed, by the wooden dilution, unless\r\n     in the case of a few exceptionally tender stomachs. Hence, when\r\n     the great mass of the English people declare that they want to\r\n     have the children in the elementary schools taught the Bible, and\r\n     when it is plain from the terms of the Act, the debates in and\r\n     out of Parliament, and especially the emphatic declarations of\r\n     the Vice-President of the Council that it was intended that such\r\n     Bible-teaching should be permitted, unless good cause for\r\n     prohibiting it could be shewn, I do not see what reason there is\r\n     for opposing that wish.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to explain that, although he had always been strongly in\r\nfavour of secular education, by that term he meant only education\r\nwithout theology, and he praised the English Bible in language as\r\nnoble as has ever been applied to it by the most ardent of\r\ntheologians.\r\n\r\n     \"The Pagan moralists lack life and colour, and even the noble\r\n     Stoic, Marcus Antoninus, is too high and refined for an ordinary\r\n     child. Take the Bible as a whole; make the severest deductions\r\n     which fair criticism can dictate for shortcomings and positive\r\n     errors; eliminate, as a sensible lay-teacher would do, if left to\r\n     himself, all that is not desirable for children to occupy\r\n     themselves with; and there still remains in this old literature a\r\n     vast residuum of moral beauty and grandeur. And then consider the\r\n     great historical fact that, for three centuries, this book has\r\n     been woven into the life of all that is best and noblest in\r\n     English history; that it has become the national epic of Britain,\r\n     and is as familiar to noble and simple, from Land's End to\r\n     John-o'-Groat's House, as Dante and Tasso once were to the\r\n     Italians; that it is written in the noblest and purest English,\r\n     and abounds in exquisite beauties of mere literary form; and,\r\n     finally, that it forbids the veriest hind who never left his\r\n     village to be ignorant of the existence of other countries and\r\n     other civilisations, and of a great past, stretching back to the\r\n     furthest limits of the oldest nations in the world. By the study\r\n     of what other book could children be so much humanised and made\r\n     to feel that each figure in that vast historical procession\r\n     fills, like themselves, but a momentary space in the interval\r\n     between two eternities; and earns the blessings and the curses of\r\n     all time, according to its effort to do good and hate evil, even\r\n     as they also are earning their payment for their work.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, he laid down the lines of the general education to be given.\r\nHe pointed out that already in the existing schools a very\r\nconsiderable burden of work was imposed on the children in the form of\r\ncatechism, lists of the kings of Israel, geography of Palestine, and\r\nthat when these fantastic modes of education had been eliminated there\r\nwas plenty of time and energy to be employed. The instruction in\r\nphysical training was more than half play; that in the domestic\r\nsubjects had an engrossing interest of its own. He proposed, first,\r\nthe necessary discipline in the means for acquiring knowledge, the\r\ntools for employing it, that is to say, reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic. After that, he believed that a certain amount of\r\nknowledge, of intellectual discipline, and of artistic training should\r\nbe conveyed in the elementary schools, and for these purposes he\r\nproposed to teach some rudiments of physical science, drawing, and\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nIn most respects the progress of primary education in England has been\r\na continuous progress along these lines suggested by Huxley, and he\r\nmay be regarded as in this fashion one of the great shapers of the\r\ndestinies of his race, for nothing can have a bearing more important\r\non the character and fate of a race than the manner of training\r\nprovided for the masses of individuals composing it. It is only in the\r\nmatter of the religious instruction that the course of events has been\r\nwidely different from the neutral exposition of the Bible as suggested\r\nby him. In 1870 a great majority of the people of England who\r\nreflected upon the matter at all, and all those who accepted current\r\nideas without reflection, accepted the Bible as an inspired, direct,\r\nand simple authority on all great matters of faith and morality.\r\nTherefore, when Huxley, as by far the most important man among those\r\nwho advocated a secular education, was an advocate and not in the\r\nleast an opponent of Bible teaching, they were well content to let the\r\nmatter rest. There were, it is true, a certain number of zealots who\r\nentered the boards with the avowed purpose, on the one hand, of\r\ngetting as much dogmatic teaching and interpretation added as it might\r\nbe possible to smuggle in, and, on the other, to reduce the simplest\r\nBible teaching to a minimum. But the vast majority of persons were out\r\nof sympathy with these fanaticisms. Since 1870, however, a gradual\r\nchange has occurred in the attitude of the majority to the Bible in\r\nEngland. The growth of the new criticism and of knowledge of it has\r\nproduced the result that now only a small minority of reflecting\r\npeople in England accept the Bible in the old simple way; the majority\r\nthinks that it requires interpretation and explanation by the\r\nauthority of the Church. And so a new battle over dogma has begun;\r\nmoderate Church people no longer accept the compromise of Huxley, but\r\nstrive for an interpretation which must be dogmatic, and there is a\r\nnew dispute as to what may be regarded as undenominational religion.\r\nWhen a majority of reasonable persons accepted Huxley's suggestions of\r\nsimple Bible teaching they did so not because they believed, as he\r\ndid, that the Bible was simply great literature, great tradition, and\r\ngreat morality, but because they believed it to be direct, inspired\r\nauthority. It is a curious coincidence that Huxley himself did so much\r\nto spread knowledge of the new criticism, and that a first result of\r\nthis diffusion was to overthrow the compromise arranged largely by his\r\ninfluence, and which for many years provided a middle way in which\r\nsensible persons avoided the extremes of theological and\r\nanti-theological zealots.\r\n\r\nEarly in the course of his career as a member of the London School\r\nBoard, Huxley crystallised his views as to the general policy of\r\neducation in a phrase which perhaps has done more than any other\r\nphrase ever invented to bring home to men's minds the ideal of a\r\nnational system of education. \"I conceive it to be our duty,\" he said,\r\n\"to make a ladder from the gutter to the university along which any\r\nchild may climb.\" We have seen the nature of his views as to the\r\nlowest rungs of this ladder; we may now turn to his work and views as\r\nto the higher stages. He expressed these views in occasional speeches\r\nand articles, and he had many important opportunities in aiding to\r\ncarry them into actual practice. He was a member of a number of\r\nimportant Royal Commissions: Commission on the Royal College of\r\nScience for Ireland, 1866; Commission on Science and Art Instruction\r\nin Ireland, 1868; Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction and the\r\nAdvancement of Science, 1870-75; Royal Commission to enquire into the\r\nUniversities of Scotland, 1876-78; Royal Commission on the Medical\r\nActs, 1881-82. From the beginning, he was closely associated with the\r\nScience and Art Department, the operations of which threw a web of\r\neducation, intermediate between primary and university education, all\r\nover Britain. A number of the teachers under that department were\r\ntrained by him, and as examiner to the department he took the greatest\r\ncare to reduce to a minimum the evils necessarily attendant on the\r\nmode of payment by results. A certain number of teachers made it\r\ntheir chief effort to secure the largest possible number of grants.\r\nHuxley regarded these as poachers of the worst kind, and did all he\r\ncould to foil them. He did all he could to promote systematic\r\npractical instruction in the classes, and to aid teachers who desired\r\nto learn their business more thoroughly. He insisted again and again\r\nupon the popular nature of the classes; their great advantage was that\r\nthey were accessible to all who chose to avail themselves of them\r\nafter working hours, and that they brought the means of instruction to\r\nthe doors of the factories and workshops. The subjects which he\r\nconsidered of most importance were foreign languages, drawing, and\r\nelementary sciences, and he wished them to be used first of all by\r\nthose who were handicraftsmen and who therefore left the elementary\r\nschools at the age of thirteen or fourteen.\r\n\r\nIn a lecture given at the formal opening of the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity at Baltimore in 1876, and in a Rectorial address to the\r\nUniversity of Aberdeen two years earlier, Huxley laid down the general\r\nlines of university education as he conceived it. He began by\r\nsupposing that a good primary education had already been received.\r\n\r\n     \"Such an education should enable an average boy of fifteen or\r\n     sixteen to read and write his own language with ease and\r\n     accuracy, and with a sense of literary excellence derived from\r\n     the study of our classic writers; to have a general acquaintance\r\n     with the history of his own country and with the great laws of\r\n     social existence; to have acquired the rudiments of the physical\r\n     and psychological sciences, and a fair knowledge of elementary\r\n     arithmetic and geometry. He should have obtained an acquaintance\r\n     with logic rather by example than by precept; while the\r\n     acquirement of the elements of music and drawing should have been\r\n     a pleasure rather than work.\"\r\n\r\nHe had not much to say for secondary or intermediate education, partly\r\nbecause at that time, in England at least, the secondary schools were\r\nin a hopeless state of incapacity, and differed from primary schools\r\nnot only in their greater expense, their adaptation to the\r\nclass-spirit which demanded the separation of the boys of the upper\r\nand middle classes from those in the lower ranks of society, but\r\nchiefly in the futility of the education given at the majority of\r\nthem. But where intermediate schools did exist, he demanded that they\r\nshould keep on the same wide track of general knowledge, not\r\nsacrificing one branch of knowledge for another. He held that the\r\nelementary instruction to which he had referred embraced all the real\r\nkinds of knowledge and mental activity possible to man. The university\r\ncould add no new fields of mental activity, no new departments of\r\nknowledge. What it could do was to intensify and specialise the\r\ninstruction in each department.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus literature and philology, represented in the elementary\r\n     school by English alone, in the university will extend over the\r\n     ancient and modern languages. History, which like charity, best\r\n     begins at home, but, like charity, should not end there, will\r\n     ramify into anthropology, archæology, political history, and\r\n     geography, with the history of the growth of the human mind and\r\n     of its products, in the shape of philosophy, science, and art,\r\n     and the university will present to the student libraries, museums\r\n     of antiquities, collections of coins, and the like, which will\r\n     efficiently subserve these studies. Instruction in the elements\r\n     of political economy, a most essential but hitherto sadly\r\n     neglected part of elementary education, will develop in the\r\n     university into political economy, sociology, and law. Physical\r\n     science will have its great divisions, of physical geography,\r\n     with geology and astronomy; physics; chemistry and biology;\r\n     represented not merely by professors and their lectures, but by\r\n     laboratories in which the students, under guidance of\r\n     demonstrators, will work out facts for themselves and come into\r\n     that direct contact with reality which constitutes the\r\n     fundamental distinction of scientific education. Mathematics will\r\n     soar into its highest regions; while the high peaks of philosophy\r\n     may be scaled by those whose aptitude for abstract thought has\r\n     been awakened by elementary logic. Finally, schools of pictorial\r\n     and plastic art, of architecture, and of music will offer a\r\n     thorough discipline in the principles and practice of art to\r\n     those in whom lies nascent the rare faculty of æsthetic\r\n     representation, or the still rarer powers of creative genius.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventies the problems connected with what is called\r\ntechnical education became prominent in the minds of the most\r\nfar-seeing of this nation. It became plain that England was not\r\nadvancing with the same strides as some other nations in arts and\r\nmanufactures, and the most obvious difference between England and the\r\nrivals whose advance was causing anxiety lay in her deficiency in\r\neducation. Science or knowledge of nature lies at the root of all the\r\narts and manufactures, and it was our relation to scientific teaching\r\nand research that required investigation. Naturally enough, Huxley\r\ntook the keenest interest in this question and made large\r\ncontributions to its solution, contributions which have not yet been\r\nput completely into operation. He insisted most strongly upon a point\r\nthat we as a nation have not yet completely grasped. There is no\r\ndifference between applied science and any other kind of science. The\r\nchemistry of manufactures, the physics of industrial machinery, the\r\nbiology of agriculture and of fisheries, are not different from other\r\nchemistries and physics and biologies. They are merely special cases\r\nof the application of the same general fund of knowledge, and the same\r\ngeneral principles of investigation. Huxley wished that the term\r\n\"applied science\" had never been invented, or that it could be\r\ndestroyed. A man cannot study the chemistry of dyeing or make advances\r\nin it unless he be a thoroughly trained chemist in the full sense of\r\nthe word. More than that, many of the greatest discoveries, using the\r\nword \"great\" as applied to commercial advantage rather than to\r\nabstract progress in knowledge, have been made by those who were\r\npursuing research for its own sake rather than for any immediate\r\ncommercial advantage to be derived from it. Hence he regarded it of\r\nvital importance, from the mere point of view of the prosperity of the\r\ncountry, that there should be a sufficiently large number of\r\nscientific men provided with the means for research in the shape of\r\nincome and appliances. The most immediately utilitarian fashion for\r\nthe nation to encourage science, was to encourage science in its\r\nhighest and most advanced aspects. This meant the endowment of\r\nresearch and the support of universities and other institutions in\r\nwhich research might be conducted, and Huxley strove unceasingly for\r\nthe benefit of all such great organisations. One of the last public\r\noccasions of his life was his appearance as leader of a deputation to\r\nurge upon the government the formation of a real university in London\r\nwhich should unite the scattered institutions of that great city and\r\npromote the highest spheres of the pursuit of knowledge. He held the\r\nview, strongly, that a useful combination was to be made by uniting\r\nthe functions of teaching and investigation. A teacher taught better\r\nwhen his mind was kept fresh by the advances he himself was making,\r\nand an investigator, by having a moderate amount of teaching to do,\r\ngained from the need of forcing his mind from time to time to take\r\nbroad surveys of the whole field a part of which he was engaged in\r\ntilling. The first great object, then, in promoting science so as to\r\nreap the most direct national advantage from it, was to encourage\r\nscience in its highest and widest forms. It cannot be said that\r\nEngland has yet learned this lesson. The number of institutions in\r\nGermany where advanced investigation is continuously pursued is\r\nabsolutely and relatively greater than the number in England.\r\n\r\nThe second part of technical education is that to which general\r\nattention is more commonly given. It consists of the kind of training\r\nto be given to the great army of workers in the country. In regard to\r\nthis, as in regard to research work, Huxley insisted on the absence of\r\ndistinction between technical or applied science and science without\r\nsuch a limiting prefix. So far as technical instruction meant definite\r\nteaching of a handicraft, he believed that it could be learned\r\nsatisfactorily only in the workshop itself.\r\n\r\n     \"The workshop is the only real school for a handicraft. The\r\n     education which precedes that of the workshop should be entirely\r\n     devoted to the strengthening of the body, the elevation of the\r\n     moral faculties, and the cultivation of the intelligence; and,\r\n     especially, to the imbuing of the mind with a broad and clear\r\n     view of the laws of that natural world with the components of\r\n     which the handicraftsman will have to deal. And, the earlier the\r\n     period of life at which the handicraftsman has to enter into the\r\n     actual practice of his craft, the more important is it that he\r\n     should devote the precious hours of preliminary education to\r\n     things of the mind, which have no direct and immediate bearing on\r\n     his branch of industry, though they lie at the foundation of all\r\n     the realities.\"\r\n\r\nHe compared his own handicraft as an anatomist with the handicrafts of\r\nartisans, and declared that the kind of preliminary training he would\r\nchoose for himself or for his pupils was precisely the training he\r\nwould provide for them. He did not wish that one who proposed to be a\r\nbiologist should learn dissection during his school-days; that would\r\ncome later, and, in the meantime, broader and deeper foundations had\r\nto be laid. These were the ordinary subjects of a liberal education:\r\nphysical training, drawing, and a little music, French and German, the\r\nordinary English subjects, and the elements of physical science.\r\nAgainst such costly schemes of education for the whole population of a\r\nnation, many objections have been urged. Of these, perhaps the chief\r\nis that the majority of human beings even in the most civilised\r\ncountry are not capable of profiting by or taking an interest in, or\r\ncertainly of advancing far in, most subjects. Huxley met such\r\nobjections in a spirit of the widest statesmanship. There were two\r\nreasons for making the general education of all what he called a\r\nliberal education. The first was that, even in a liberal education\r\nsuch as he advocated, no subject was pursued beyond the broad\r\nelementary stages, and that during the early years of life, while the\r\nframework and the character were forming, it was of first-rate\r\nimportance not to stunt either by lack of material. The second great\r\nprinciple was that until any individual had had the opportunity, it\r\nwas impossible to say whether or no he would profit much or little,\r\nand the gain to the whole nation by not missing any of those who were\r\nborn with unusual natural capacity was more than worth the cost of\r\naffording opportunities to all.\r\n\r\n     \"The great mass of mankind have neither the liking, nor the\r\n     aptitude, for either literary or scientific or artistic pursuits;\r\n     nor, indeed, for excellence of any sort. Their ambition is to go\r\n     through life with moderate exertion and a fair share of ease,\r\n     doing common things in a common way. And a great blessing and\r\n     comfort it is that the majority of men are of this mind; for the\r\n     majority of things to be done are common things, and are quite\r\n     well enough done when commonly done. The great end of life is not\r\n     knowledge but action. What men need is as much knowledge as they\r\n     can assimilate and organise into a basis for action; give them\r\n     more and it may become injurious. One knows people who are as\r\n     heavy and stupid from undigested learning as others are from\r\n     over-fulness of meat and drink. But a small percentage of the\r\n     population is born with that most excellent quality, a desire for\r\n     excellence, or with special aptitude of some sort or another....\r\n     Now, the most important object of all educational schemes is to\r\n     catch these exceptional people, and turn them to account for the\r\n     good of society. No man can say where they will crop up; like\r\n     their opposites, the fools and the knaves, they appear sometimes\r\n     in the palace, and sometimes in the hovel; but the great thing to\r\n     be aimed at, I was almost going to say, the most important end of\r\n     all social arrangements, is to keep these glorious sports of\r\n     Nature from being either corrupted by luxury or starved by\r\n     poverty, and to put them into the position in which they can do\r\n     the work for which they are specially fitted.... I weigh my words\r\n     when I say that if the nation could purchase a potential Watt or\r\n     Davy or Faraday, at the cost of a hundred thousand pounds down,\r\n     he would be dirt cheap at the money.\"\r\n\r\nThe beginning and end of the whole matter was that a national system\r\nof education was above all things a \"capacity-catcher,\" designed to\r\nsecure against the loss of the incalculable advantages to be gained by\r\ncultivating the best genius born in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCITIZEN, ORATOR, AND ESSAYIST\r\n\r\n     Huxley's Activity in Public Affairs--Official in Scientific\r\n     Societies--Royal Commissions--Vivisection--Characteristics of his\r\n     Public Speaking--His Method of Exposition--His\r\n     Essays--Vocabulary--Phrase-Making--His Style Essentially one of\r\n     Ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great body of fine work in science and literature has been produced\r\nby persons who may be described as typically academic. Such persons\r\nconfine their interest in life within the boundaries of their own\r\nimmediate pursuits; they are absorbed so completely by their\r\navocations that the hurly-burly of the world seems needlessly\r\ndistracting and a little vulgar. No doubt the thoughts of those who\r\ncry out most loudly against disturbance by the intruding claims of the\r\nworld are, for the most part, hardly worth disturbing; the attitude to\r\nextrinsic things of those who are absorbed by their work is aped not\r\ninfrequently by those who are absorbed only in themselves. None the\r\nless it is important to recognise that a genuine aversion from affairs\r\nis characteristic of many fine original investigators, and it is on\r\nsuch persons that the idea of the simple and childlike nature of\r\nphilosophers, a simplicity often reaching real incapacity for the\r\naffairs of life, is based. There was no trace of this natural\r\nisolation in the character of Huxley. He was not only a serious\r\nstudent of science but a keen and zealous citizen, eagerly conscious\r\nof the great social and political movements around him, with the full\r\nsense that he was a man living in society with other men and that\r\nthere was a business of life as well as a business of the laboratory.\r\nWe have seen with what zeal he brought his trained intelligence to\r\nbear not only on his own province of scientific education, but on the\r\nwider problems of general education, and yet the time he gave to these\r\nwas only a small part of that which he spared from abstract science\r\nfor affairs. In scientific institutions as in others, there is always\r\na considerable amount of business, involving the management of men and\r\nthe management of money, and Huxley's readiness and aptitude led to\r\nhis being largely occupied with these. For many years he was Dean of\r\nthe Royal College of Science at South Kensington, and for a\r\nconsiderable time he served the Geological Society and the Royal\r\nSociety as secretary. In all these posts, Huxley displayed great\r\ncapacity as a leader of men and as a manager of affairs, and\r\ncontributed largely to the successful working of the institutions\r\nwhich he served.\r\n\r\nIn England, when troublesome questions press and seem to call for new\r\nlegislation, it frequently happens that the collection and sifting of\r\nevidence preliminary to legislation is a task for which the methods\r\nand routine of Parliament are unsuitable. The Queen, acting through\r\nher responsible advisers, appoints a Royal Commission, consisting of a\r\nsmall body of men, to which is entrusted the preliminary task of\r\ncollecting and weighing evidence, or of making recommendations on\r\nevidence already collected. To such honourable posts Huxley was\r\nrepeatedly called. He served on the following Commissions: 1. Royal\r\nCommission on the Operation of Acts relating to Trawling for Herrings\r\non the Coast of Scotland, 1862. 2. Royal Commission to Enquire into\r\nthe Sea Fisheries of the United Kingdom, 1864-65. 3. Commission on the\r\nRoyal College of Science for Ireland, 1866. 4. Commission on Science\r\nand Art Instruction in Ireland, 1868. 5. Royal Commission on the\r\nAdministration and Operation of the Contagious Diseases Acts, 1870-71.\r\n6. Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of\r\nScience, 1870-75. 7. Royal Commission on the Practice of Subjecting\r\nLive Animals to Experiments for Scientific Purposes, 1876. 8. Royal\r\nCommission to Enquire into the Universities of Scotland, 1876-78. 9.\r\nRoyal Commission on the Medical Acts, 1881-82. 10. Royal Commission on\r\nTrawl, Net, and Beam-Trawl Fishing, 1884. This is a great record for\r\nany man, especially for one in whose life work of this kind was\r\noutside his habitual occupation. It was no doubt in special\r\nrecognition of the important services given his country by such work,\r\nas well as in general recognition of his distinction in science, that\r\nhe was sworn a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council, so attaining a\r\ndistinction more coveted than the peerage.\r\n\r\nThe voluminous reports of the Commissions shew that Huxley, very far\r\nfrom being a silent member of them, took a large part in framing the\r\nquestions which served to direct witnesses into useful lines, and that\r\nhis clear and orderly habit of thought proved as useful in the\r\nelucidation of these subjects as they were in matters of scientific\r\nresearch. For the most part, the problems brought before the\r\nCommissions have lost their interest for readers of later years, but\r\nthere are matters still unsettled on which the opinions of Huxley as\r\nexpressed then remain useful. The Commission of 1876, for instance,\r\ndealt with vivisection, a matter on which the conscience of the\r\nordinary man is not yet at rest. Although Huxley was intensely\r\ninterested in the problems of physiology, and although at one time he\r\nhoped to devote his life to them, fortune directed otherwise, and the\r\ninvestigations for which he is famed did not in any way involve the\r\nkind of experiments known as vivisection. The greater part of his work\r\nwas upon the remains of creatures dead for thousands of years or upon\r\nthe lifeless skeletons of modern forms. On the other hand, he was\r\nkeenly interested in the progress of physiological science, he had\r\npersonal acquaintance with most of the distinguished workers in\r\nphysiology of his time at home and abroad, and from this knowledge of\r\ntheir character and aspirations he was well able to judge of the\r\nwholesale and reckless accusations brought against them. He was a man\r\nfull of the finest humanity, with an unusual devotion to animals as\r\npets, and with knowledge of the degrees of pain involved in\r\nexperimenting on living creatures. He insisted strongly on the\r\nnecessity of limiting or abolishing pain, wherever it was possible; he\r\nagreed that any experiments which involved pain should not be\r\npermitted for the purpose of demonstrating known elementary facts.\r\nBut, from his knowledge of the incalculable benefits which had been\r\ngained from experimental research, and from his confidence in those\r\nwho conducted it, he declined to give support to the misguided\r\nfanatics who desired to make such experimental research a penal\r\noffence, even when conducted by the most skilled experts for the\r\nhighest purposes.\r\n\r\nHuxley contributed his share to the great questions which agitated\r\nthe public not only by service on Commissions, but by delivering a\r\nlarge number of public addresses and writing a large number of essays\r\non topics of special interest. Much of his work on scientific,\r\neducational, and general subjects took its first shape in the form of\r\naddresses given to some public audience. University audiences in\r\nEngland, Scotland, and America were familiar to him, and from time to\r\ntime he addressed large gatherings of a mixed character. But probably\r\nhis favourite audience was composed of working men, and he had the\r\ngreatest respect for the intelligence and sympathy of hearers who like\r\nhimself passed the greater portion of their time in hard work.\r\nProfessor Howes, his pupil, friend, and successor, writes of him:\r\n\r\n     \"He gave workmen of his best. The substance of _Man's Place in\r\n     Nature_, one of the most successful and popular of his writings,\r\n     and of his _Crayfish_, perhaps the most perfect zoölogical\r\n     treatise ever published, was first communicated to them. In one\r\n     of the last communications I had with him, I asked his views as\r\n     to the desirability of discontinuing the workmen's lectures at\r\n     Jermyn Street, since the development of workmen's colleges and\r\n     institutes was regarded by some as rendering their continuance\r\n     unnecessary. He replied, almost with indignation, 'With our\r\n     central situation and resources we ought to be in a position to\r\n     give the workmen that which they cannot get elsewhere,' adding\r\n     that he would deeply deplore any such discontinuance.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley had no natural facility for speech. He tells us that at first\r\nhe disliked it, and that he had a firm conviction that he would break\r\ndown every time he opened his mouth. The only two possible faults of a\r\npublic speaker which he believed himself to be without, were \"talking\r\nat random and indulging in rhetoric.\" With practice, he lost this\r\nearlier hesitancy, and before long became known as one of the finest\r\nspeakers of his time. Certain natural gifts aided him; his well-set\r\nfigure and strong features, of which the piercing eyes and firm,\r\ntrap-like mouth were the most striking, riveted attention, while his\r\nvoice had a wide range and was beautifully modulated. But it was above\r\nall things the matter and not the manner of his speech that commanded\r\nsuccess. He cared little or nothing for the impression he might\r\nmake--everything for the ideas which he wished to convey. He was\r\nconcerned only to set forth these ideas in their clear and logical\r\norder, convinced in his own mind that, were the facts as he knew them\r\nplaced before the minds of his hearers, only one possible result could\r\nfollow. The facts had convinced him: they must equally convince any\r\nhonest and intelligent person placed in possession of them. He had not\r\nthe smallest intention of overbearing by authority or of swaying by\r\nskilfully aroused emotion. Such weapons of the orator seemed to him\r\ndishonest in the speaker and most perilous to the audience. For him,\r\nspeaking on any subject was merely a branch of scientific exposition;\r\nwhen emotion was to be roused or enthusiasm to be kindled the\r\ninspiration was to come from the facts and not from the orator. The\r\narts he allowed himself were those common to all forms of exposition;\r\nhe would explain a novel set of ideas by comparison with simpler ideas\r\nobvious to all his listeners; and he sought to arrest attention or to\r\ndrive home a conclusion by some brilliant phrase that bit into the\r\nmemory. These two arts, the art of the phrase-maker and the art of\r\nexplaining by vivacious and simple comparison, he brought to a high\r\nperfection. The fundamental method of his exposition was simply the\r\nmethod of comparative anatomy, the result of a habit of thinking which\r\nmakes it impossible to have any set of ideas brought into the mind\r\nwithout an immediate, almost unconscious, overhauling of the memory\r\nfor any other ideas at all congruous. In a strict scientific\r\nexposition Huxley would choose from the multitude of possible\r\ncomparisons that most simple and most intelligible to his audience;\r\nwhen in a lighter vein, he gave play to a natural humour in his\r\nchoice. Instances of his method of exposition by comparison abound in\r\nhis published addresses. Let us take one or two. In the course of an\r\naddress to a large mixed audience so early in his public career as\r\n1854, in making plain to them the proposition, somewhat novel for\r\nthose days, that the natural history sciences had an educational\r\nvalue, he explained that the faculties employed in that subject were\r\nsimply those of the common sense of every-day life.\r\n\r\n     \"The vast results obtained by Science are won by no mystical\r\n     faculties, by no mental processes other than those which are\r\n     practised by every one of us, in the humblest and meanest affairs\r\n     of life. A detective policeman discovers a burglar from the marks\r\n     made by his shoe, by a mental process identical with that by\r\n     which Cuvier restored the extinct animals of Montmartre from\r\n     fragments of their bones. Nor does that process of induction and\r\n     deduction by which a lady, finding a stain of a peculiar kind on\r\n     her dress, concludes that somebody has upset the inkstand\r\n     thereon, differ in any way, in kind, from that by which Adams and\r\n     Leverrier discovered a new planet.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of his addresses to working men on _Man's Place in Nature_ he\r\nshewed that from time to time in the history of the world average\r\npersons of the human race have accepted some kind of answer to the\r\ninsoluble riddles of existence, but that from time to time the race\r\nhas outgrown the current answers, ceasing to take comfort from them.\r\n\r\n     \"In a well-worn metaphor a parallel is drawn between the life of\r\n     man and the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly; but\r\n     the comparison may be more just as well as more novel, if for its\r\n     former term we take the mental progress of the race. History\r\n     shews that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of\r\n     knowledge, periodically grows too large for its theoretical\r\n     coverings, and bursts them asunder to appear in new habiliments,\r\n     as the feeding and growing grub, at intervals, casts its too\r\n     narrow skin and assumes another, itself but temporary. Truly, the\r\n     imago state of man seems to be terribly distant, but every moult\r\n     is a step gained, and of such there have been many.\"\r\n\r\nAs another instance, the following from his address on a \"Liberal\r\nEducation\" may be taken. He had been discussing the intellectual\r\nadvantage to be derived from classical studies, and had been\r\ncomparing, to the disadvantage of the latter, the intellectual\r\ndiscipline which might be got from a study of fossils with the\r\ndiscipline claimed by the ordinary experts upon education to be the\r\nresults of classical training. He wished to anticipate the obvious\r\nobjection to his argument: that the subject-matter of palæontology had\r\nno direct bearing on human interests and emotions, while the classical\r\nauthors were rich in the finest humanity.\r\n\r\n     \"But it will be said that I forget the beauty and the human\r\n     interest, which appertain to classical studies. To this I reply\r\n     that it is only a very strong man who can appreciate the charms\r\n     of landscape as he is toiling up a steep hill, along a bad road.\r\n     What with short-windedness, stones, nits, and a pervading sense\r\n     of the wisdom of rest and be thankful, most of us have little\r\n     enough sense of the beautiful under these circumstances. The\r\n     ordinary schoolboy is precisely in this case. He finds Parnassus\r\n     uncommonly steep, and there is no chance of his having much time\r\n     or inclination to look about him till he gets to the top. And\r\n     nine times out of ten he does not get to the top.\"\r\n\r\nThe last example we shall take comes from a speech made after dinner\r\nat a much later period of his life. The occasion was a complimentary\r\ndinner to the editor of the English scientific periodical _Nature_,\r\nwhich had been for long the leading semi-popular journal of English\r\nscience. Huxley, in proposing the health of the editor, declared that\r\nhe did not quite know how to say what he wanted to say, but that he\r\nwould explain by a story.\r\n\r\n     \"A poor woman,\" he said, \"was brought into one of our hospitals\r\n     in a shockingly battered condition. When her wounds had been\r\n     cleaned and sewn, and when the care of the surgeons had restored\r\n     her to comparative comfort, someone said to her, 'I am afraid\r\n     your husband has been knocking you about.' 'What!' she said, 'my\r\n     Jim bash me? no it worn't by him; he's always been more like a\r\n     friend to me than a husband.' That,\" went on Huxley, \"is what I\r\n     wish to say about our guest of to-night. In all our intercourse\r\n     with him he has been more like a friend to us than an editor.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to make a real distinction between the essays and the\r\naddresses of Huxley. Many of the most important of his addresses, as\r\nfor instance his Romanes lecture on \"Evolution and Ethics,\" were\r\nwritten and printed before he delivered them; most of them were\r\ncarefully prepared, and revised and printed after delivery. It is\r\ntherefore not remarkable to find a close resemblance in matter and\r\nmanner between what was originally spoken and what was published\r\nwithout a _vivâ voce_ delivery. Everything that may be said of the one\r\nset applies with an equal fitness to the other set. There are many\r\nwho assert with confidence that Huxley is one of the great masters of\r\nEnglish, and although an examination of this opinion involves\r\ndiscussion of the elusive quality termed \"style,\" it is necessary to\r\nattempt it.\r\n\r\nIn that totality which consists of an essay or of a printed address,\r\nand of which we are, most of us, ready to discuss the style, there are\r\nat least three separable elements, each contributing after its kind to\r\nthe effect on our minds. When the general effect is to throw us into a\r\nstate of pleasure, it is our habit to qualify the style with an\r\nadjective of praise, selecting the adjective according to the degree\r\nof restraint or of enthusiasm with which we are accustomed to express\r\nour emotions; when the general effect is to throw us into a condition\r\nof boredom or of distaste, we make a corresponding choice of\r\nappropriate adjectives. When we wish to be specially critical we pass\r\na little way beyond an empirical judgment by pleasure or annoyance and\r\ntake into account the degree of harmony between matter and manner. In\r\nsuch a frame of mind we discount the pleasure obtained from verbal\r\nquips, if these occur in a grave exposition, or that received from\r\nsolemn and stately harmonies of language if these be employed on\r\ninsignificant trifles. In a condition of unusual critical exaltation\r\nwe may even admit an excellence of language and phrasing though these\r\nhave as their contents ideas which we dislike, or press towards\r\nconclusions from which we dissent. But if we desire to make an exact\r\nappreciation of literary style, it is requisite to examine separately\r\nthe three elements which contribute to the effect produced on us by\r\nany written work. These three elements are the words or raw materials\r\nemployed, the building of words into sentences and of sentences into\r\nparagraphs, which may be designated as the architectural work, and,\r\nfinally, the ideas conveyed, that is to say, the actual object of the\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nHuxley was a wide and omnivorous reader, and so had an unusually large\r\nfund of words at his disposal. His writings abound with quotations and\r\nallusions taken from the best English authors, and he had a profound\r\nand practical belief in the advantage to be gained from the reading of\r\nEnglish. \"If a man,\" he wrote, \"cannot get literary culture out of his\r\nBible, and Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and Milton, and Hobbes, and\r\nBishop Berkeley, to mention only a few of our illustrious writers--I\r\nsay, if he cannot get it out of these writers, he cannot get it out of\r\nanything.\" He had at least a fair knowledge of Greek in the original,\r\nand a very wide acquaintance with Greek phrasing and Greek ideas\r\nderived from a study of Greek authors in English versions. He had an\r\nunusual knowledge of Latin, both of the classical writers and of the\r\nearly Church fathers and mediæval writers on science and metaphysics.\r\nFrench and German, the two foreign languages which are a necessary\r\npart of the mental equipment of an English-speaking man of science,\r\nwere familiar to him. Finally, he had of necessity the wide and varied\r\nvocabulary of the natural and technical sciences at his disposal. From\r\nthese varied sources, Huxley had a fund of words, a store of the raw\r\nmaterial for expressing ideas, very much greater and more varied than\r\nthat in the possession of most writers. You will find in his writings\r\nabundant and omnipresent evidence of the enormous wealth of verbal\r\nmaterial ready for the ideas he wished to set forth: a Greek phrase, a\r\nGerman phrase, a Latin or French phrase, or a group of words borrowed\r\nfrom one of our own great writers always seemed to await his wish.\r\nGeneral Booth's scheme for elevating the masses by cymbals and dogma\r\nwas \"corybantic Christianity\"; to explain what he thought was the\r\nCatholic attitude to the doctrine of evolution, he said it would have\r\nbeen called _damnabilis_ by Father Suarez, and that he would have\r\nmeant \"not that it was to be damned, but that it was an active\r\nprinciple capable of damning.\" Huxley was like a builder who did not\r\nlimit himself while he was constructing a house to the ordinary\r\nmaterials from the most convenient local quarry, but who collected\r\nendlessly from all the quarries and brickfields of the world, and\r\nbrought to his heaps curiously wrought stones taken from a thousand\r\nold buildings. The swift choice from such a varied material gave an\r\nease and appearance of natural growth to his work; it produced many\r\nsurprising and delightful combinations, and it never sacrificed\r\nconvenience of expression to exigencies of the materials for\r\nexpression. On the other hand, Huxley lacked the sedulous concern for\r\nwords themselves as things valuable and delightful; the delight of the\r\ncraftsman in his tools; the dainty and respectful tribute paid to the\r\nwords themselves; in fine, he took little pleasure in words themselves\r\nand used them as counters rather than as coins. Careful reflection and\r\nexamination will make it plain that the pleasure to be got from\r\nHuxley's style is not due in any large measure to his choice and\r\nhandling of words. There is no evidence that he deliberately and\r\nfastidiously preferred one word to another, that he took delight in\r\nthe savour of individual words, in the placing of plain words in a\r\ncontext to make them sparkle, in the avoidance of some, in the\r\ndeliberate preference of other words,--in fact, in all the conscious\r\ntricks and graces that distinguish the lover of words from their mere\r\nuser.\r\n\r\nA close examination discovers a similar absence from Huxley's work of\r\nthe second contributory to the total effect produced by written words.\r\nAnything that may be said about absence of artistry in the use of\r\nwords, may be said as to absence of artistry in building of the words\r\ninto sentences, of the sentences into paragraphs and pages. In the\r\nfirst place, actual infelicities of sentence-building are frequent.\r\nClause is piled on clause, qualifying phrases are interpolated, the\r\neasy devices of dashes and repetitions are employed wherever\r\nconvenience suggests them. It is striking to find how infrequent is\r\nthe occurrence of passages marked in any way by sonorous rhythm or by\r\nthe charm of a measured proportion. The purple passages themselves,\r\nthose which linger in the memory and to which the reader turns back,\r\nlinger by their sense and not by their sound. For indeed the truth of\r\nthe matter is that Huxley's style was a style of ideas and not of\r\nwords and sentences. The more closely you analyse his pages the more\r\ncertainly you find that the secret of the effect produced on you lies\r\nin the gradual development of the precise and logical ideas he wished\r\nto convey, in the brilliant accumulation of argument upon argument, in\r\nthe logical subordination of details to the whole, in fact, in the\r\narts of the convinced, positive, and logical thinker, who knew exactly\r\nwhat he meant you to know and who set about telling you it with the\r\nleast possible concern for the words he used or for the sentences into\r\nwhich he formed his words. The ideas and their ordering are the root\r\nand the branches, the beginning and the end of his style. To put it\r\nin another way: it would be extremely easy to translate any of\r\nHuxley's writings into French or German, and they would lose extremely\r\nlittle of the personal flavour of their author. The present writer has\r\njust been reading French translations of Huxley's _Physiography_ and\r\n_Crayfish_, made at different times by different translators. At first\r\nreading it seems almost miraculous how identically the effect produced\r\nby the original is reproduced by the French rendering, but the secret\r\nis really no secret at all. Huxley produced his effects by the\r\nordering of his ideas and not by the ordering of his words. From the\r\ntechnical point of view of literary craftsmanship, he cannot be\r\nassigned a high place; he is one of our great English writers, but he\r\nis not a great writer of English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE OPPONENT OF MATERIALISM\r\n\r\n     Science and Metaphysics--Berkeley, Hume, and Hobbes--Existence of\r\n     Matter and Mind--Descartes's Contribution--Materialism and\r\n     Idealism--Criticism of Materialism--Berkeley's\r\n     Idealism--Criticism of Idealism--Empirical Idealism--Materialism\r\n     as opposed to Supernaturalism--Mind and Brain--Origin of\r\n     Life--Teleology, Chance, and the Argument from Design.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of independent thinking in any branch of knowledge\r\nleads to the ultimate problems of philosophy. The mathematician cannot\r\nponder over the meaning of his figures, the chemist that of his\r\nreactions, the biologist that of his tissues and cells, the\r\npsychologist that of sensations and conceptions, without being tempted\r\nfrom the comparatively secure ground of observations and the\r\narrangement of observations into the perilous regions of metaphysics.\r\nMost scientific men return quickly, repelled and perhaps a little\r\nscared by the baffling confusion of that windy region of thought where\r\nno rules of logic seem incontrovertible, no conclusions tenable, and\r\nno discussions profitable. Huxley, however, not only entered into\r\nmetaphysical questions with enthusiasm, but gave a great deal of time\r\nto the study of some of the great metaphysical writers. His views are\r\nto be found scattered through very many of his ordinary scientific\r\nwritings, but are specially set forth in a volume on _Hume_, which he\r\nwrote for Mr. John Morley's series, _English Men of Letters_, and in\r\nessays on Berkeley and on Descartes, all of which are republished in\r\nthe _Collected Essays_. He contrived to preserve, in the most\r\nabstrusely philosophical of these writings, a simplicity and clarity\r\nwhich, although they have not commended him to professional\r\nmetaphysicians, make his attitude to the problems of metaphysics\r\nextremely intelligible. The greatest barrier and cause of confusion to\r\nthe novice in metaphysics is that the writings of most of the great\r\nauthorities are overburdened by their great knowledge of the history\r\nof philosophy. Huxley, in a characteristic piece of \"parting advice\"\r\nin the preface to his work on Hume attacked this confusion between the\r\nhistory of a subject and the subject itself.\r\n\r\n     \"If it is your desire,\" he wrote, \"to discourse fluently and\r\n     learnedly about philosophical questions, begin with the Ionians\r\n     and work steadily through to the latest new speculative treatise.\r\n     If you have a good memory and a fair knowledge of Greek, Latin,\r\n     French, and German, three or four years spent in this way should\r\n     enable you to attain your object. If, on the contrary, you are\r\n     animated by the much rarer desire for real knowledge; if you want\r\n     to get a clear conception of the deepest problems set before the\r\n     intellect of man, there is no need, so far as I can see, for you\r\n     to go beyond the limits of the English tongue. Indeed, if you are\r\n     pressed for time, three English authors will suffice, namely,\r\n     Berkeley, Hume, and Hobbes.\"\r\n\r\nThe first and perhaps the greatest problem in metaphysics can be put\r\nvery shortly. What is the reality behind the apparent universe of\r\nmatter and mind we see around us? Or, rather, what do we know of that\r\nreality? To the uninitiated in philosophical thinking it seems\r\nsufficiently plain that there are two entities, body and soul in man,\r\nmatter and mind in the whole universe; and various types of\r\nintelligent dogmatists, ranging from the sturdy if somewhat stupid\r\nshrewdness of Dr. Johnson to the agile casuistry of Catholic\r\nmetaphysicians, have supported this simple verdict of \"common sense.\"\r\nTrouble begins, however, with any attempt to analyse the relations\r\nbetween what we call \"matter\" and what we call \"mind.\" It appears, for\r\ninstance, that what we call matter we only know in terms of mind. In\r\nan essay on Descartes's _Discourse on Method_, Huxley explains this by\r\nsimple examples.\r\n\r\n     \"I take up a marble and I find it to be a red, round, hard,\r\n     single body. We call the redness, the roundness, the hardness and\r\n     the singleness, 'qualities' of the marble; and it sounds, at\r\n     first, the height of absurdity to say that all these qualities\r\n     are modes of our own consciousness, which cannot even be\r\n     conceived to exist in the marble. But consider the redness, to\r\n     begin with. How does the sensation of redness arise? The waves of\r\n     a certain very attenuated matter, the particles of which are\r\n     vibrating with vast rapidity, but with very different velocities,\r\n     strike upon the marble, and those which vibrate with one\r\n     particular velocity are thrown off from its surface in all\r\n     directions. The optical apparatus of the eye gathers some of\r\n     these together, and gives them such a course that they impinge\r\n     upon the surface of the retina, which is a singularly delicate\r\n     apparatus connected with the terminations of the fibres of the\r\n     optic nerve. The impulses of the attenuated matter, or ether,\r\n     affect this apparatus and the fibres of the optic nerve in a\r\n     certain way; and the change in the fibres of the optic nerve\r\n     produces yet other changes in the brain; and these, in some\r\n     fashion unknown to us, give rise to the feeling, or\r\n     consciousness, of redness. If the marble could remain unchanged,\r\n     and either the vibrations of the ether, or the nature of the\r\n     retina, could be altered, the marble would seem not red, but some\r\n     other colour. There are many people who are what are called\r\n     colour-blind, being unable to distinguish one colour from\r\n     another. Such an one might declare our marble to be green; and\r\n     he would be quite as right in saying that it is green as we are\r\n     in declaring it to be red. But then, as the marble itself cannot\r\n     be both green and red, at the same time, this shews that the\r\n     quality redness must be in our consciousness and not in the\r\n     marble.\"\r\n\r\nIn similar fashion he shewed that the hardness, roundness, and even\r\nthe singleness of the marble were, so far as we know, states of our\r\nconsciousness and not in the marble. The argument is capable of\r\napplication to all that we call matter, and it thus appears, on\r\nanalysis, that what we know of matter is simply a series of states of\r\nour consciousness, or mind. In similar fashion, it turns out that what\r\nwe call mind is, so far as practical experience goes, always\r\nassociated with and dependent on what we call matter. We have no\r\ndirect knowledge of thinking without a brain, or of consciousness\r\nwithout a body. Alterations and changes in matter, as for instance in\r\nthe tissues and nutrition of the body, are, so far as our experience\r\ngoes, inseparably associated with mental operations. In the animal\r\nkingdom we see the development of the mind creeping slowly after the\r\ndevelopment of the material nervous system, until, in man, the most\r\ncomplex mind and most complex consciousness of which we have knowledge\r\naccompany the most complex body and brain.\r\n\r\nTwo great rival solutions to this fundamental problem are Materialism\r\nand Idealism. Materialism supposes that what we call matter is the\r\nreal substance of the universe, and that mind is merely one of the\r\nforms of its activity. The advance of physical science has done much\r\nto make the materialistic hypothesis more plausible. When matter was\r\nbelieved to be inert, the mere vehicle or theatre of forces,\r\nmaterialism remained a singularly crude and unsatisfying position. But\r\nnow that science has shewn all that we call matter--the most solid\r\nmetals and the most attenuated vapours, the most stable and resisting\r\ninorganic bodies, and the unstable tissues of living bodies--to be\r\nalike in restless, orderly motion, to be, in fact, motion itself and\r\nnot the thing moved, to be changeable but indestructible, passing\r\nthrough phases but eternal, there seems less difficulty in assuming it\r\nto be the ultimate reality, and mind and consciousness to be its most\r\nhighly specialised qualities. Huxley, while stating this view plainly\r\nenough, refused to accept it as a legitimate conclusion from the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n     \"For anything that may be proved to the contrary, there may be a\r\n     real something which is the cause of all our impressions; that\r\n     sensations, though not likenesses, are symbols of that something;\r\n     and that the part of that something, which we call the nervous\r\n     system, is an apparatus for supplying us with a sort of algebra\r\n     of fact, based on these symbols. A brain may be the machinery by\r\n     which the material universe becomes conscious of itself. But it\r\n     is important to notice that, even if this conception of the\r\n     uuiverse and of the relation of consciousness to its other\r\n     components should be true, we should, nevertheless, be still\r\n     bound by the limits of thought, still unable to refute the\r\n     arguments of pure idealism. The more completely the materialistic\r\n     position is admitted, the easier it is to show that the\r\n     idealistic position is unassailable, if the idealist confines\r\n     himself within the limits of positive knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nHowever we attempt to form what philosophers call \"ejects,\" to imagine\r\nthat what is really in our consciousness is really the world outside\r\nourselves, these ejects remain mere phenomena of our minds. Matter\r\nitself and its changes may, in the long run, be but modes of motion,\r\nbut \"our knowledge of motion is nothing but that of a change in the\r\nplace and order of our sensations; just as our knowledge of matter is\r\nrestricted to those feelings of which we assume it to be the cause.\"\r\nHuxley's exact position in regard to materialism is most plain in his\r\nexpositions of the writings of Berkeley, with whom began in England\r\nthe greatest movement towards an idealistic philosophy.\r\n\r\n     \"Berkeley faced the problem boldly. He said to the materialists:\r\n     'You tell me that all the phenomena of nature are resolvable into\r\n     matter and its affections. I assent to your statement, and now I\r\n     put to you the further question, What is matter? In answering\r\n     this question you shall be bound by your own conditions; and I\r\n     demand, in the terms of the Cartesian axiom, that you in turn\r\n     give your assent only to such conclusions as are perfectly clear\r\n     and obvious.'\"\r\n\r\nHuxley then goes on to state the general lines of the arguments by\r\nwhich Berkeley arrived at the apparently paradoxical conclusion \"that\r\nall the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth--in a word, all\r\nthose bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world,\" have an\r\nexistence only so far as they are in a perceiving mind. And he\r\nproceeds at length to explain the immense importance of the truths\r\nunderlying Berkeley's position.\r\n\r\n     \"The key to all philosophy lies in the clear apprehension of\r\n     Berkeley's problem--which is neither more nor less than one of\r\n     the shapes of the greatest of all questions, 'What are the limits\r\n     of our faculties?' And it is worth any amount of trouble to\r\n     comprehend the exact nature of the argument by which Berkeley\r\n     arrived at his results, and to know by one's own knowledge the\r\n     great truth which he discovered--that the honest and rigorous\r\n     following up of the argument which leads us to materialism\r\n     inevitably carries us beyond it.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley, however, while he opposed a materialistic explanation of the\r\nuniverse with the strength of exposition and acute reasoning at his\r\ndisposal, did not pass directly into the other camp and become a pure\r\nidealist.\r\n\r\n     \"Granting the premisses,\" he wrote, \"I do not see any escape from\r\n     Berkeley's conclusion, that the substance of matter is a\r\n     metaphysical unknown quantity, of the existence of which there is\r\n     no proof. What Berkeley does not seem to have so clearly\r\n     perceived is that the non-existence of a substance of mind is\r\n     equally arguable; and that the result of the impartial\r\n     application of his reasonings is the reduction of the all to\r\n     co-existences and sequences of phenomena, beneath and beyond\r\n     which there is nothing cognoscible.\"\r\n\r\nHume had written: \"What we call a mind is nothing but a heap or\r\ncollection of different perceptions, united together by certain\r\nrelations, and supposed, though falsely, to be endowed with a perfect\r\nsimplicity and identity.\" Here was mind rejected for the same negative\r\nreasons as matter, and Huxley was as ready to point out that while we\r\ncan know nothing of the\r\n\r\n     \"substance of the thinking thing, we go beyond legitimate\r\n     reasoning if we therefore deny its existence.\" ... \"Hume may be\r\n     right or wrong, but the most he or anyone else can prove in\r\n     favour of his conclusions is, that we know nothing more of the\r\n     mind than that it is a series of perceptions. Whether there is\r\n     something in the mind that lies beyond the reach of observation,\r\n     or whether perceptions themselves are the products of something\r\n     which can be observed and which is not mind, are questions which\r\n     can in no wise be settled by direct observation.\"\r\n\r\nIn another passage he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"To sum up. If the materialist affirms that the universe and all\r\n     its phenomena are resolvable into matter and motion, Berkeley\r\n     replies, True; but what you call matter and motion are known to\r\n     us only as forms of consciousness; their being is to be conceived\r\n     or known; and the existence of a state of consciousness, apart\r\n     from a thinking mind, is a contradiction in terms. I conceive\r\n     that this reasoning is irrefragable. And therefore, if I were\r\n     obliged to choose between absolute materialism and absolute\r\n     idealism, I should feel compelled to accept the latter\r\n     alternative. Indeed, upon this point Locke does, practically, go\r\n     as far in the direction of idealism as Berkeley, when he admits\r\n     that the 'simple ideas which we receive from sensation and\r\n     reflection are the boundaries of our thoughts, beyond which the\r\n     mind, whatever efforts it would make, is not able to advance one\r\n     jot.'\"\r\n\r\nLocke went further, and Huxley agreed with him. He declared that the\r\nmind cannot \"make any discoveries when it would pry into the nature\r\nand hidden cause of these ideas.\" We must, in fact, definitely reject\r\nwhat we know as matter as the absolute reality of the universe, for it\r\nbecomes very plain that what we call matter we know merely as\r\naffections of our own consciousness. In a sense, then, so far as it is\r\nopposed to materialism, idealism, according to Huxley, must be the\r\nphilosophical position of a scientific man. But the idealism is not\r\nthe absolute idealism of Berkeley, as we have no logical right to deny\r\nor to affirm the existence of absolute matter or of absolute mind. The\r\nreal truth of the philosophy of science lies in a separation between\r\nmetaphysical theory and actual pursuits. In ultimate philosophical\r\ntheory it is impossible to rest content with a plain natural\r\nconception of the universe. When any conception of matter, or of its\r\naffections, is pushed as far as analysis can take us, what we know\r\nresolves itself into affections of mind, into what without\r\nmetaphysical finesse may be called ideas. But this empirical idealism\r\nmust be taken positively as being merely the limits of our knowledge,\r\nand it must carry with it neither an undue exaltation of mind nor an\r\nundue depreciation of matter.\r\n\r\n     \"The Platonic philosophy is probably the grandest example of the\r\n     unscientific use of the imagination extant; and it would be hard\r\n     to estimate the amount of detriment to clear thinking effected,\r\n     directly and indirectly, by the theory of ideas, on the one hand,\r\n     and by the unfortunate doctrine of the baseness of matter, on the\r\n     other.\"\r\n\r\nMaterialism was dismissed by Huxley as being an inadequate\r\nphilosophical explanation of the universe, and as being based on a\r\nlogical delusion. There remains, however, a practical application of\r\nthe word in which the conceptions it involves are almost an inevitable\r\npart of science, and which was strenuously urged by Huxley. In the\r\nearlier days of the world and of science almost all the phenomena of\r\nnature were regarded as random or wilful displays of living\r\nintelligence. The earth itself and the sun, the moon, and the stars\r\nwere endowed with life; legions of unseen intelligences ruled the\r\noperations of nature, and although these might be bribed or\r\nthreatened, pleased or made angry, their actions were regarded as\r\nbeyond prediction or control. The procession of the seasons, the\r\nroutine of day and night, the placid appeasement of the rains, the\r\ndevastating roar of storms, the shining of the rainbow, the bubbling\r\nof springs, the terrors of famine and pestilence; all these--the\r\nvarying environment which makes or mars human life--were regarded as\r\ninevitable and capricious. The whole progress of physical science has\r\nbeen attended with a gradual elimination of these supernatural\r\nagencies and with a continual replacement of them by conceptions of\r\nphysical sequence.\r\n\r\n     \"In singular contrast with natural knowledge, the acquaintance of\r\n     mankind with the supernatural appears the more exact, and the\r\n     influence of supernatural doctrine on conduct the greater, the\r\n     further we go back in time and the lower the stage of\r\n     civilisation submitted to investigation. Historically, indeed,\r\n     there would seem to be an inverse relation between supernatural\r\n     and natural knowledge. As the latter has widened, gained in\r\n     precision and trustworthiness, so has the former shrunk, grown\r\n     vague and questionable; as the one has more and more filled the\r\n     sphere of action, so has the other retreated into the region of\r\n     meditation, or vanished behind the screen of mere verbal\r\n     recognition. Whether this difference of the fortunes of\r\n     Naturalism and Supernaturalism is an indication of the progress,\r\n     or of the regress of humanity, of a fall from or an advance\r\n     towards the higher life, is a matter of opinion. The point to\r\n     which I wish to direct attention is that the difference exists\r\n     and is making itself felt. Men are growing seriously alive to the\r\n     fact that the historical evolution of humanity, which is\r\n     generally, and I venture to think, not unreasonably, regarded as\r\n     progress, has been and is being accompanied by a co-ordinate\r\n     elimination of the supernatural from its originally large\r\n     occupation of men's thought.\"\r\n\r\nEvery stage in this long process, every new attempt to place physical\r\nphenomena in a chain of direct causation has been denounced as\r\ndangerous and degrading materialism, and in this sense Huxley was not\r\nonly an adherent but one of the foremost champions of materialism. As\r\neveryone knows, some of the greatest advances in this process of\r\nco-ordinating physical phenomena were made during Huxley's life; and\r\nhis vigorous onslaughts on those who tried to thwart all attempts at\r\nmaterial explanations in favour of unknown agencies made him specially\r\nopen to abusive criticism. The battle was almost invariably between\r\nthose who had not special knowledge and those in possession of it, and\r\nit occurred in practically the whole field of science, but\r\nparticularly in the biological sciences. A single example will serve\r\nto shew what is meant by materialism in this sense and the attitude of\r\nHuxley to it. The study of the human mind naturally has attracted the\r\nattention of thinkers almost since the beginning of philosophy, but\r\nuntil this century, with a few crude exceptions, it has been conducted\r\nentirely apart from anatomy and physiology. Advances in these physical\r\nsciences, however, have changed that, and the modern psychologist has\r\nto begin by being a physiologist and anatomist.\r\n\r\n     \"Surely no one who is cognisant of the facts of the case,\r\n     nowadays, doubts that the roots of psychology lie in the\r\n     physiology of the nervous system. What we call the operations of\r\n     the mind are the functions of the brain, and the materials of\r\n     consciousness are products of cerebral activity. Cabanis may have\r\n     made use of crude and misleading phraseology when he said that\r\n     the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile; but the\r\n     conception which that much-abused phrase embodies is,\r\n     nevertheless, far more consistent with fact than the popular\r\n     notion that the mind is a metaphysical entity seated in the head,\r\n     but as independent of the brain as a telegraph operator is of his\r\n     instrument. It is hardly necessary to point out that the doctrine\r\n     just laid down is what is commonly called materialism. I am not\r\n     sure that the adjective 'crass,' which appears to have a special\r\n     charm for rhetorical sciolists, would not be applied to it. But\r\n     it is, nevertheless, true that the doctrine contains nothing\r\n     inconsistent with the purest idealism.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole doctrine of evolution is similarly a materialistic account\r\nof natural phenomena, in the popular and not the philosophical meaning\r\nof the term. But even within this popular meaning, it is extremely\r\nnecessary to have an exact conception of the limits within which\r\nHuxley was materialistic. Take for instance the question of the origin\r\nof life. It would be one of the greatest achievements of physical\r\nscience could it shew that life was not inco-ordinate with non-living\r\nphysical phenomena, but was a special case of them. Huxley knew that\r\nthis advance had not yet been made.\r\n\r\n     \"It may be that, by-and-by, philosophers will discover some\r\n     higher laws of which the facts of life are particular cases--very\r\n     possibly they will find out some bond between physico-chemical\r\n     phenomena on the one hand, and vital phenomena on the other. At\r\n     present, however, we assuredly know of none; and I think we shall\r\n     exercise a wise humility in confessing that, for us at least,\r\n     this successive assumption of different states (external\r\n     conditions remaining the same)--this spontaneity of action--if I\r\n     may use a term which implies more than I would be answerable\r\n     for--which constitutes so vast and plain a practical distinction\r\n     between living bodies and those which do not live, is an ultimate\r\n     fact; indicating as such, the existence of a broad line of\r\n     demarcation between the subject matter of biological and of all\r\n     other science.\"\r\n\r\nIn another passage he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Looking back through the prodigious vista of the past I find no\r\n     record of the commencement of life, and therefore I am devoid of\r\n     any means of forming a definite conclusion as to the conditions\r\n     of its appearance. Belief, in the scientific sense of the word,\r\n     is a serious matter, and needs strong foundations. To say,\r\n     therefore, in the admitted absence of evidence, that I have any\r\n     belief as to the mode in which the existing forms of life have\r\n     originated, would be using words in a wrong sense. But\r\n     expectation is permissible where belief is not; and if it were\r\n     given me to look beyond the abyss of geologically recorded time\r\n     to the still more remote period when the earth was passing\r\n     through physical and chemical conditions which it can no more see\r\n     again than a man can recall his infancy, I should expect to be a\r\n     witness of the evolution of living protoplasm from non-living\r\n     matter. I should expect to see it appear under forms of great\r\n     simplicity, endowed, like existing fungi, with the power of\r\n     determining the formation of new protoplasm from such matters as\r\n     ammonium carbonates, oxalates, and tartrates, alkaline and earthy\r\n     phosphates, and water, without the aid of light. That is the\r\n     expectation to which analogical reasoning leads me, but I beg you\r\n     once more to recollect that I have no right to call my opinion\r\n     anything but an act of philosophical faith.\"\r\n\r\nSince these words were written the reasons for Huxley's \"philosophic\r\nfaith\" have been strengthened by later discoveries, and perhaps a\r\nmajority of biologists would take the view that except for practical\r\npurposes there is no sound reason for placing living and inorganic\r\naggregations of matter in totally different categories. But even if\r\nthe main outline of the theory of evolution were proved beyond the\r\npossibility of doubt, if we could trace existing plants and animals\r\nbackwards with the accuracy of a genealogist and find that they had\r\nbeen developed, under purely physical \"laws\" from a few simple forms,\r\nand if we could understand exactly how these few simple forms of\r\nliving matter took origin from non-living matter, we would not, if we\r\nfollowed Huxley, be able to rest in a purely materialistic position.\r\nAs he, in different words, repeatedly said:\r\n\r\n     \"It is very desirable to remember that evolution is not an\r\n     explanation of the cosmos, but merely a generalised statement of\r\n     the method and results of that process. And, further, that, if\r\n     there is any proof that the cosmic process was set going by any\r\n     agent, then that agent will be the creator of it and of all its\r\n     products, although supernatural intervention may remain strictly\r\n     excluded from its further course.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of evolution was, for him, no attempt to reinstate the\r\n\"old pagan goddess, Chance.\" Darwin had again and again explained, and\r\nHuxley again and again had called attention to the explanation, that\r\nwhen words like \"chance\" and \"spontaneous\" were used, no more was\r\nintended to be implied than an ignorance of the causes. In the true\r\nsense of the word \"chance\" did not exist for Huxley and Darwin. So far\r\nas all scientific and common experience goes, every event is connected\r\nwith foregoing events in an orderly and inevitable chain of\r\nsequences,--a chain that could have been predicted or predetermined\r\nby any sufficient intelligence. Moreover, Huxley did not believe that\r\nDarwin's views, rightly interpreted, \"abolished teleology and\r\neviscerated the argument from design.\" They only abolished that crude\r\nexpression of teleology which supposed all structures among animals\r\nand plants to have been created in their present forms for their\r\npresent purposes. Under the stimulus given to biology by the doctrine\r\nof evolution that science has progressed far beyond conceptions so\r\nrudely mechanical. We know that behind each existing structure there\r\nis a long history of change; of change not only in form and\r\nappearance, but also in function. In the development of living\r\norganisms to-day, as they grow up into tree or animal from seed or\r\negg, we can trace the record of these changes of form; in some cases\r\nwe can follow the actual change of function. But in a wider sense\r\nthere is no incongruity between evolution and teleology.\r\n\r\n     \"There is a wider teleology,\" Huxley wrote, \"which is not touched\r\n     by the doctrine of evolution, but is actually based on the\r\n     fundamental proposition of evolution. This proposition is that\r\n     the whole world, living and not living, is the result of the\r\n     mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces\r\n     possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of\r\n     the universe was composed. That acute champion of teleology,\r\n     Paley, saw no difficulty in admitting that the 'production of\r\n     things' may be the result of mechanical dispositions fixed\r\n     beforehand by intelligent appointment and kept in action by a\r\n     power at the centre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF THOUGHT\r\n\r\n     Authority and Knowledge in Science--The Duty of Doubt--Authority\r\n     and Individual Judgment in Religion--The Protestant Position--Sir\r\n     Charles Lyell and the Deluge--Infallibility--The Church and\r\n     Science--Morality and Dogma--Civil and Religious\r\n     Liberty--Agnosticism and Clericalism--Meaning of\r\n     Agnosticism--Knowledge and Evidence--The Method of Agnosticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the practice of modern law-courts, a witness rarely is allowed to\r\noffer as evidence any statement for which he himself is not the direct\r\nauthority. What he himself saw or heard or did with regard to the\r\nmatter at issue--these, and not what others told him they had seen or\r\nheard or done, are the limits within which he is allowed to be a\r\ncompetent witness. As a matter of fact, in the business of life we\r\nhave to act differently. A large proportion of our opinions, beliefs,\r\nand reasons for conduct must come to us on the authority of others. We\r\nhave no direct experience of the past; of the present we can see\r\nlittle and only the little immediately surrounding us. In a multitude\r\nof affairs we have to act on authority, to accept from books or from\r\npersons what we have not ourselves the opportunity of knowing. It\r\nwould seem, then, to be a primary duty to learn to distinguish in our\r\nminds those matters which we know directly from those matters which we\r\nhave accepted on trust; and, secondly, to learn and to apply the best\r\nmodes of choosing the good and of rejecting the bad authorities. The\r\nwork of the scientific man is a lifelong exercise of these primary\r\nduties. From the first moment he begins to observe living things or to\r\ndissect their dead frameworks, to mix chemical substances, to make\r\nexperiments with magnets and wires, he begins to build, and as long as\r\nhe continues to work he continues to build for himself a body of\r\nfirst-hand knowledge. But, however he work arduously or through long\r\nyears, he can visit only the smallest portion of the field of nature\r\nin which he is working. It is necessary for him to employ the work of\r\nothers, submitting, from time to time such accepted work to the tests\r\nsuggested by his own observations. He learns to regard in a different\r\nlight all knowledge taken on the authority of others; to distrust it a\r\nlittle until he has learned to weigh its general credibility by his\r\nown standards, and its particular credibility by subjecting portions\r\nof it to his own tests; to distrust it still more when even small\r\nportions fail to answer his tests, and to reject it altogether when\r\nthe percentage of detected error is large. He learns, in fact, what\r\nHuxley called the duty of doubt.\r\n\r\nThis duty has not been universally accepted. In the history of\r\nChristian civilisation (and a parallel series of events might be\r\nportrayed from the history of other civilisations), many great\r\ninstitutions and very many great and good men have condemned and\r\nfeared the habit and attitude of doubt in all its forms. Certain\r\ndoctrines believed to be of supreme importance to mankind were held to\r\nrest on authority independent of, and perhaps not susceptible to, the\r\nkind of testing employed in science. Around these doctrines there\r\ngrew, in time, a body of traditions, customs, new dogmas, and\r\nfantasies; and the duty of belief in the first was extended to cover\r\nthe whole system, the central jewel as well as the accretions and\r\nencrustations of time. The domain of religious authority was extended\r\nto the whole field of human thought and of human action, and the more\r\nunreasonable the dominion became, the more strenuously was the duty of\r\nbelief urged. The Protestant Reformation was one of the great stages\r\nin the conflict for freedom against the universal tyranny that had\r\narisen, but the reformers very naturally retained a considerable\r\nportion of the bias against which they had fought. In Protestant\r\ncountries, in the first half of this century, the duty of belief in\r\nthe Protestant doctrines, traditions, philosophy, history, and\r\nattitude to science reigned supreme, and all weapons, from legitimate\r\nargument to abusive invective and social ostracism, were employed\r\nagainst those who acted in accordance with the duty of doubt.\r\nAllegations of \"unsoundness\" or of \"free thinking\" became barriers to\r\nsuccess in life, and those against whom they were made became lowered\r\nin the esteem of their fellows.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, when the advance of science and of civilisation\r\nhas almost won the battle for freedom of thought, it is difficult to\r\nrealise the strength of the forces against which Huxley and many\r\nothers had to fight. Huxley himself said with perfect justice: \"I\r\nhardly know of a great physical truth whose universal reception has\r\nnot been preceded by an epoch in which most estimable persons have\r\nmaintained that the phenomena investigated were directly dependent on\r\nthe Divine Will, and that the attempt to investigate them was not\r\nonly futile but blasphemous.\" As a particular instance of this he\r\ncited some episodes in the history of geological science.\r\n\r\n     \"At the present time, it is difficult to persuade serious\r\n     scientific enquirers to occupy themselves, in any way, with the\r\n     Noachian Deluge. They look at you with a smile and a shrug, and\r\n     say they have more important matters to attend to than mere\r\n     antiquarianism. But it was not so in my youth. At that time\r\n     geologists and biologists could hardly follow to the end any path\r\n     of enquiry without finding the way blocked by Noah and his ark,\r\n     or by the first chapter of Genesis; and it was a serious matter,\r\n     in this country at any rate, for a man to be suspected of\r\n     doubting the literal truth of the Diluvial or any other\r\n     Pentateuchal history. The fiftieth anniversary of the foundation\r\n     of the Geological Club (in 1824) was, if I remember rightly, the\r\n     last occasion on which the late Sir Charles Lyell spoke to even\r\n     so small a public as the members of that body. Our veteran leader\r\n     lighted up once more; and, referring to the difficulties which\r\n     beset his early efforts to create a rational science of geology,\r\n     spoke, with his wonted clearness and vigour, of the social\r\n     ostracism which pursued him after the publication of the\r\n     _Principles of Geology_, in 1830, on account of the obvious\r\n     tendency of that noble work to discredit the Pentateuchal\r\n     accounts of the Creation and the Deluge. If my younger\r\n     contemporaries find this hard to believe, I may refer them to a\r\n     grave book _On the Doctrine of the Deluge_, published eight years\r\n     later, and dedicated by the author to his father, the then\r\n     Archbishop of York. The first chapter refers to the treatment of\r\n     the 'Mosaic Deluge,' by Dr. Buckland and Mr. Lyell, in the\r\n     following terms: 'Their respect for revealed religion has\r\n     prevented them from arraying themselves openly against the\r\n     Scriptural account of it--much less do they deny its truth--but\r\n     they are in a great hurry to escape from the consideration of it,\r\n     and evidently concur in the opinion of Linnæus, that no proofs\r\n     whatever of the Deluge are to be discovered in the structure of\r\n     the earth.' And after an attempt to reply to some of Lyell's\r\n     arguments, which it would be cruel to reproduce, the writer\r\n     continues:--'When, therefore, upon such slender grounds, it is\r\n     determined, in answer to those who insist on its universality,\r\n     that the Mosaic Deluge must be considered a preternatural event,\r\n     far beyond the reach of philosophical enquiry; not only as to the\r\n     causes employed to produce it, but as to the effects most likely\r\n     to result from it; that determination wears an aspect of\r\n     scepticism, which, however much soever it may be unintentional in\r\n     the mind of the writer, yet cannot but produce an evil impression\r\n     on those who are already predisposed to carp and cavil at the\r\n     evidence of Revelation.'\"\r\n\r\nThe great evil of authority was its tendency to erect itself into some\r\nform of infallibility of universal application. When, for a time, the\r\ngeological victory was won, and the supporters of authority had\r\ncomforted themselves with reconciliations, there arose the much\r\ngreater and more serious opposition between authority and the\r\nconceptions involved in evolution. Huxley, as we have seen in an\r\nearlier chapter, found that all the old weapons of authority were\r\nresumed with a renewed assurance, and his advocacy of the duty of\r\ndoubt became not merely the defence of a great principle but a means\r\nof self-defence. The conception of infallible authority had been\r\ntransferred by Protestants from the Church to the Bible, and against\r\nthis Huxley strove with all his might. It is convenient to reserve a\r\nfull treatment of Huxley's attitude to the Bible for a separate\r\nchapter, but at this point a quotation will shew his general view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR CHARLES LYELL]\r\n\r\n     \"The truth is that the pretension to infallibility, by whomsoever\r\n     made, has done endless mischief; with impartial malignity it has\r\n     proved a curse, alike to those who have made it and those who\r\n     have accepted it; and its most baneful shape is book\r\n     infallibility. For sacerdotal corporations and schools of\r\n     philosophy are able, under due compulsion of opinion, to retreat\r\n     from positions that have become untenable; while the dead hand of\r\n     a book sets and stiffens, amidst texts and formulæ, until it\r\n     becomes a mere petrifaction, fit only for that function of\r\n     stumbling-block, which it so admirably performs. Wherever\r\n     bibliolatry has prevailed, bigotry and cruelty have accompanied\r\n     it. It lies at the root of the deep-seated, sometimes disguised,\r\n     but never absent, antagonism of all varieties of ecclesiasticism\r\n     to the freedom of thought and to the spirit of scientific\r\n     investigation.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, Presbyter is but Priest writ large, and the Protestant\r\nclergy were the leaders in denunciation of every person and every\r\nbranch of investigation or of thought in any way connected with\r\nevolution. Huxley was no respecter of persons, and, following the\r\nexample of Darwin, he was ready to study carefully any arguments for\r\nor against any scientific doctrines by whomsoever or howsoever brought\r\nforward. The right of criticism and duty of doubt, which he insisted\r\non for himself, he was extremely willing to extend to others, and, as\r\na matter of fact he was on terms of intimate friendship with some of\r\nhis most distinguished clerical opponents. But to an extent which it\r\nis almost impossible now to realise, the clergy generally abused their\r\nlegitimate position and authority, and demanded or assumed a right to\r\ngive authoritative opinions on questions which did not come within\r\ntheir domain. It was the old attempt of the Church to make its\r\nauthority felt in all departments of thought and of action, and the\r\nattempt was made in the traditional fashion. Questions of fact were\r\nassociated with questions of morality, and those who held one view as\r\nto the meaning and implication of certain facts were denounced as\r\nwicked. Huxley at once carried the war into the enemy's own country:\r\n\r\n     \"And, seeing how large a share of this clamour is raised by the\r\n     clergy of one denomination or another, may I say, in conclusion,\r\n     that it really would be well if ecclesiastical persons would\r\n     reflect that ordination, whatever deep-seated graces it may\r\n     confer, has never been observed to be followed by any visible\r\n     increase in the learning or the logic of its subject. Making a\r\n     man a Bishop, or entrusting him with the office of ministering to\r\n     even the largest of Presbyterian congregations, or setting him up\r\n     to lecture to a church congress, really does not in the smallest\r\n     degree augment such title to respect as his opinions may\r\n     intrinsically possess. And when such a man presumes on an\r\n     authority, which was conferred on him for other purposes, to sit\r\n     in judgment on matters his incompetence to deal with which is\r\n     patent, it is permissible to ignore his sacerdotal pretensions,\r\n     and to tell him, as one would tell a mere, common, unconsecrated\r\n     layman: that it is not necessary for any man to occupy himself\r\n     with problems of this kind unless he so choose; life is filled\r\n     full enough with the performance of its ordinary and obvious\r\n     duties. But that, if a man elect to become a judge of these grave\r\n     questions; still more if he assume the responsibility of\r\n     attaching praise or blame to his fellow-men for the conclusions\r\n     at which they arrive touching them, he will commit a sin more\r\n     grievous than most breaches of the decalogue, unless he avoid a\r\n     lazy reliance upon the information that is gathered by prejudice\r\n     and filtered through passion, unless he go back to the prime\r\n     sources of knowledge--the facts of Nature, and the thoughts of\r\n     those wise men who for generations past have been her best\r\n     interpreters.\"\r\n\r\nIn the campaign for absolute freedom of thought, for the duty of not\r\nbelieving anything except on sufficient evidence, Huxley was\r\nfrequently met by an argument of superficial strength, and which no\r\ndoubt was in the minds of many of his clerical opponents. In the minds\r\nof a majority of people, it was said, and particularly of slightly\r\neducated people, the reasons for right conduct and the distinctions\r\nbetween right and wrong are firmly associated with the Bible and with\r\nreligion. If you allow doubts as to the absolute veracity of the\r\nBible, or as to the supernatural origin of religion to reach such\r\npersons, you run a grave risk that they will reflect the uncertainty\r\non the canons of morality. In taking from them what you believe to be\r\nfalse, inevitably you will unsettle their ideas on moral questions\r\nalthough you might be in full agreement as to these moral questions.\r\nHuxley refused to accept the asserted association between morality and\r\nparticular metaphysical or religious doctrines.\r\n\r\n     \"Many ingenious persons now appear to consider that the\r\n     incompatibility of pantheism, of materialism, and of any doubt\r\n     about the immortality of the soul, with religion and morality is\r\n     to be held as an axiomatic truth. I confess that I have a certain\r\n     difficulty in accepting this dogma. For the Stoics were\r\n     notoriously materialists and pantheists of the most extreme\r\n     character; and while no strict Stoic believed in the eternal\r\n     duration of the individual soul, some even denied its persistence\r\n     after death. Yet it is equally certain, that, of all gentile\r\n     philosophies, Stoicism exhibits the highest ethical development,\r\n     is animated by the most religious spirit, and has exerted the\r\n     profoundest influence upon the moral and religious development\r\n     not merely of the best men among the Romans, but among the\r\n     moderns down to our own day.\"\r\n\r\nHe held the view now generally taken by students of the history of\r\nman, that standards of conduct and religious beliefs arose in separate\r\nways and developed independently, and that it was only comparatively\r\nrecently that \"religion took morality under its protection.\" But he\r\nmet the argument in a still more direct fashion by rejecting entirely\r\nthe possibility or advisability of founding any system of ethics upon\r\na false basis.\r\n\r\n     \"It is very clear to me,\" he wrote, \"that, as Beelzebub is not\r\n     to be cast out by Beelzebub, so morality is not to be established\r\n     by immorality. It is, we are told, the special peculiarity of the\r\n     devil that he was a liar from the beginning. If we set out in\r\n     life with pretending to know that which we do not know; with\r\n     professing to accept for proof evidence which we are well aware\r\n     is inadequate; with wilfully shutting our eyes and our ears to\r\n     facts which militate against this or that comfortable hypothesis;\r\n     we are assuredly doing our best to deserve the same character.\"\r\n\r\nFreedom of thought meant for Huxley all that is best in liberalism\r\napplied to life. In an essay on Joseph Priestley, he described the\r\ncondition of affairs in England last century, when scientific\r\ninvestigation and all forms of independent thinking laboured under the\r\nmost heavy restrictions that could be imposed by dominant\r\necclesiastical and civil prejudice. He pointed out the astounding\r\nchanges between these times and the times of to-day.\r\n\r\n     \"If we ask,\" he wrote, \"what is the deeper meaning of all these\r\n     vast changes, there can be but one reply. They mean that reason\r\n     has asserted and exercised her primacy over all the provinces of\r\n     human activity; that ecclesiastical authority has been relegated\r\n     to its proper place; that the good of the governed has been\r\n     finally recognised as the end of government, and the complete\r\n     responsibility of governors to the people as its means; and that\r\n     the dependence of natural phenomena in general on the laws of\r\n     action of what we call matter has become an axiom.\"\r\n\r\nThe common ground of those who advocate the duty of belief and those\r\nwho insist on the duty of doubt is clear. Both are agreed as to the\r\nnecessity of accepting whatever has sufficient evidence to support it;\r\nboth agree that there is room for doubt though not necessarily for\r\nrejection in cases where the evidence is contaminated or insufficient.\r\nIt is in the application that the difference lies. The scientific\r\ntheologian admits the agnostic principle, however widely his results\r\nmay differ from those reached by the majority of agnostics. \"But, as\r\nbetween agnosticism and ecclesiasticism, or, as our neighbours across\r\nthe Channel call it, clericalism, there can be neither peace nor\r\ntruce. The cleric asserts that it is morally wrong not to believe\r\ncertain propositions, whatever the results of a strict scientific\r\ninvestigation of the evidence of these propositions. He tells us that\r\n\"religious error is, in itself, of an immoral nature\" (Newman). It\r\nnecessarily follows that, for him, the attainment of faith, not the\r\nascertainment of truth, is the highest aim of mental life.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley helped largely in the modern movement which has made it\r\nimpossible to blame people for doubt, and this was what he strove for\r\nmost strenuously. Freedom of thought, like freedom of the Press, by no\r\nmeans implies that what is free must necessarily be good. In both\r\ncases there may be a rank growth of weeds, nurtured in vicious\r\nimagination, and finding a ready market with the credulous mob. For\r\nthe detection and rejection of these, the critical method of science\r\nserves as well as it does against the loftier errors supported by\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIt was on Descartes and on Hume that Huxley founded the precise form\r\nin which he urged the duty of doubt, and his exact words are worth\r\nquoting.\r\n\r\n     \"It was in 1619, while meditating in solitary winter quarters,\r\n     that Descartes (being about the same age as Hume when he wrote\r\n     the _Treatise on Human Nature_) made that famous resolution, to\r\n     \"take nothing for truth without clear knowledge that it is such,\"\r\n     the great practical effect of which is the sanctification of\r\n     doubt; the recognition that the profession of belief in\r\n     propositions, of the truth of which there is no sufficient\r\n     evidence, is immoral; the discrowning of authority as such; the\r\n     repudiation of the confusion, beloved of sophists of all sorts,\r\n     between free assent and merely piously gagged dissent, and the\r\n     admission of the obligation to reconsider even one's own axioms\r\n     on due demand.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the healthy and active scepticism which took no direct\r\npleasure in doubting, but used doubt only as a means of making\r\nknowledge doubly secure, and which prevented false ideas being\r\nbolstered up by privilege or by tyranny.\r\n\r\n     \"The development of exact natural knowledge in all its vast\r\n     range, from physics to history and criticism, is the consequence\r\n     of the working out, in this province, of the resolution to take\r\n     nothing for truth without clear knowledge that it is such; to\r\n     consider all beliefs open to criticism; to regard the value of\r\n     authority as neither greater nor less than as much as it can\r\n     prove itself to be worth. The modern spirit is not the spirit\r\n     'which always denies,' delighting only in destruction; still less\r\n     is it that which builds castles in the air rather than not\r\n     construct; it is the spirit which works and will work 'without\r\n     haste and without rest,' gathering harvest after harvest of truth\r\n     into its barns and devouring error with unquenchable fire.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a special weakness of the modern human race to love inventing\r\ndescriptive names by which particular modes of thought may be\r\nclassified and labelled. In order to meet this demand, Huxley invented\r\nthe word _agnosticism_, to serve as a label for his own attitude. The\r\nword rapidly became popular, and attempts were made to read into it\r\nfar more than its inventor implied. For him it was no definite body of\r\ndoctrine, no creed in any positive sense. It merely expressed the\r\nattitude he assumed towards all problems on which he regarded the\r\nevidence as insufficient. It was a habit of mind rather than a series\r\nof opinions or beliefs; an intellectual weapon and not materials on\r\nwhich to exercise the intellect.\r\n\r\nHume had written that \"the justest and most plausible objection\r\nagainst a considerable part of metaphysics was that they are not\r\nproperly a science, but arise either from the fruitless efforts of\r\nhuman vanity, which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible\r\nto the human understanding, or from the craft of popular\r\nsuperstitions, which, being unable to defend themselves on fair\r\nground, raise these entangling brambles to cover and protect them.\" In\r\nthese considerations he found reason not for leaving superstition in\r\npossession of its ground, but for making a bold and arduous attack\r\nupon it in its haunts. The great difficulty in the way of carrying the\r\nwar into the enemy's own camp was that in those days so-called science\r\nwas itself cumbered with many illogical and metaphysical ideas, and\r\nfor the first time in the present century the great advances of\r\nphysical science, and, in particular, the renewed life poured by\r\nDarwin into the doctrine of evolution, made it possible to bring a new\r\nseries of exact arguments against hazy metaphysical dogmas. The\r\nmilitant side of agnosticism was directed against the camp of\r\nsuperstition and armed with the new weapons of exact science. Its\r\nstern refusal of belief without adequate evidence was a challenge to\r\nall the supporters of the sanguine philosophy which replaces proof by\r\nassured and emphatic statement and restatement. It is possible,\r\nalthough rare, for those who hold a positive belief upon evidence,\r\nhowsoever insufficient, to leave their doubting neighbours in peace,\r\nand these neighbours, assured in their own beliefs, equally positive\r\nand perhaps equally unfounded, may return the lazy tolerance. But the\r\nagnostic position is at once a reproof and a challenge to all who do\r\nnot hold it. Perhaps no one has ever put the agnostic attitude more\r\nclearly than Kant when he wrote that \"the greatest and perhaps sole\r\nuse of all philosophy of pure reason, is, after all, merely negative,\r\nsince it serves, not as an organ on (for the enlargement of\r\nknowledge), but as a discipline for its delimitation: and instead of\r\ndiscovering truth has only the modest merit of preventing error.\" It\r\nis precisely because it is addressed against error that agnosticism\r\nbrings not peace but a sword; precisely because, instead of adding to\r\nthe beliefs of the world, it seeks to examine them and perhaps by the\r\nexamination to diminish them, that it aroused passionate resentment.\r\nIn this respect it stands entirely separate and apart from any other\r\nsimilar term, as all these implied a definite acceptance or rejection\r\nof some definite propositions. Agnosticism means none of these things.\r\nHuxley said of it:\r\n\r\n     \"Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed but a method, the essence\r\n     of which lies in a rigorous application of a single principle.\r\n     That principle is of great antiquity; it is as old as Socrates;\r\n     as old as the writer who said, 'Try all things, hold fast by that\r\n     which is good'; it is the foundation of the Reformation, which\r\n     simply illustrated the axiom that every man should be able to\r\n     give reason for the faith that is in him; it is the great\r\n     principle of Descartes; it is the fundamental axiom of modern\r\n     science. Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of\r\n     the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you,\r\n     without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In\r\n     matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are\r\n     certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable. That I take\r\n     to be the agnostic faith, which, if a man keep whole and\r\n     undefiled, he shall not be ashamed to look the universe in the\r\n     face, whatever the future may have in store for him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE BIBLE AND MIRACLES\r\n\r\n     Why Huxley Came to Write about the Bible--A _Magna Charta_ of the\r\n     Poor--The Theological Use of the Bible--The Doctrine of Biblical\r\n     Infallibility--The Bible and Science--The Three Hypotheses of the\r\n     Earth's History--Changes in the Past Proved--The Creation\r\n     Hypothesis--Gladstone on Genesis--Genesis not a Record of\r\n     Fact--The Hypothesis of Evolution--The New Testament--Theory of\r\n     Inspiration--Reliance on the Miraculous--The Continuity of Nature\r\n     no _a priori_ Argument against Miracles--Possibilities and\r\n     Impossibilities--Miracles a Question of Evidence--Praise of the\r\n     Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuxley was by training and habit of mind a naturalist, busy with\r\ndissections and drawings, pursuing his branch of science for itself\r\nand with no concern as to its possible relation to philosophical\r\nspeculation or religious dogma. It is possible that, had his life been\r\npassed under different conditions, his intellectual activities might\r\nhave been spent entirely on his scientific work. As it was, he became\r\nalmost more widely known as a hostile critic of accepted religious\r\ndoctrine than as a man of science. Many causes contributed to this\r\neffect, but the chief reason was the contemporary attitude of the\r\nchurches to Darwinism. He tells us as a matter of fact that in 1850,\r\nnine years before the appearance of _The Origin of Species_, he had\r\n\"long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony which had been impressed on\r\nhis childish understanding as divine truth.\" In the chapter he\r\ncontributed to the _Life of Darwin_ he wrote that in his opinion \"the\r\ndoctrine of evolution does not even come into contact with theism,\r\nconsidered as a philosophical doctrine.\" The reason of his general\r\nattitude to the Bible was simply that his application to it of the\r\nagnostic method led him to the view that there was not sufficient\r\nevidence for the pretensions assigned to it; the reason of his coming\r\nforward as a public and active champion of his views in this matter\r\nwas partly to make a counter attack on the enemies of science, and\r\npartly his innate respect for the propagation of truth. He had the\r\ninevitable respect of an Englishman for the English Bible as one of\r\nthe greatest books in our language, and we have seen how he had\r\nadvocated its adoption in schools. He had the veneration for its\r\nethical contents common to the best thinkers of all ages since it came\r\ninto existence, and few writers have ever employed loftier or more\r\ndirect language to express their respect and admiration. As a\r\nvenerator of freedom and of liberty he regarded the Bible as the\r\ngreatest text-book of freedom.\r\n\r\n     \"Throughout the history of the Western world,\" he wrote, \"the\r\n     Scriptures, Jewish and Christian, have been the great instigators\r\n     of revolt against the worse forms of clerical and political\r\n     despotism. The Bible has been the _Magna Charta_ of the poor and\r\n     of the oppressed; down to modern times no State has had a\r\n     constitution in which the interests of the people are so largely\r\n     taken into account, in which the duties, so much more than the\r\n     privileges, of rulers are insisted upon, as that drawn up for\r\n     Israel in Deuteronomy and in Leviticus; nowhere is the\r\n     fundamental truth that the welfare of the State, in the long\r\n     run, depends on the uprightness of the citizen so strongly laid\r\n     down. Assuredly the Bible talks no trash about the rights of man;\r\n     but it insists on the equality of duties, on the liberty to bring\r\n     about that righteousness which is somewhat different from\r\n     struggling for 'rights'; on the fraternity of taking thought for\r\n     one's neighbour as for oneself.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not against the Bible but against the applications made of it\r\nand implications read into it that he strove.\r\n\r\n     \"In this nineteenth century, as at the dawn of modern physical\r\n     science, the cosmogony of the semi-barbarous Hebrew is the\r\n     incubus of the philosopher and the opprobrium of the orthodox.\r\n     Who shall number the patient and earnest seekers after truth,\r\n     from the days of Galileo until now, whose lives have been\r\n     embittered and their good name blasted by the mistaken zeal of\r\n     Bibliolaters? Who shall count the host of weaker men whose sense\r\n     of truth has been destroyed in the effort to harmonise\r\n     impossibilities--whose life has been wasted in the attempt to\r\n     force the generous new wine of science into the old bottles of\r\n     Judaism, compelled by the outcry of the same strong party? It is\r\n     true that if philosophers have suffered, their cause has been\r\n     amply avenged. Extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of\r\n     every science as the strangled snakes beside that of Hercules;\r\n     and history records that whenever science and orthodoxy have been\r\n     fairly opposed, the latter has been forced to retire from the\r\n     lists, bleeding and crushed, if not annihilated; scotched, if not\r\n     slain. But orthodoxy is the Bourbon of the world of thought. It\r\n     learns not, neither can it forget; and though, at present,\r\n     bewildered and afraid to move, it is as willing as ever to insist\r\n     that the first chapter of Genesis contains the beginning and the\r\n     end of sound science; and to visit, with such petty thunderbolts\r\n     as its half-paralysed hands can hurl, those who refuse to degrade\r\n     Nature to the level of primitive Judaism.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were written in 1860 and events have moved rapidly since\r\nHuxley wrote them. There is now practically no religious body\r\ncontaining a proportion of educated persons which does not allow\r\nwithin it a very wide range of opinion as to the inspiration of the\r\nScriptures, the Biblical account of the Creation, the miraculous\r\nevents of the Old Testament and the recorded miracles of the New.\r\nWithin the last few months, Dr. St. George Mivart, a distinguished\r\nCatholic zoölogist and long an opponent of Huxley, has declared that\r\nwithin the Catholic Church itself a number of educated persons are\r\nprepared to accept most of Huxley's positions, as well as views more\r\nextremely iconoclastic than any advanced by Huxley. Although Dr.\r\nMivart's outspoken words have called down on him the official thunders\r\nof Rome, it is an open secret that many good Catholics think this\r\nattempted exclusion of modern knowledge to be fraught with grave\r\ndanger to the Church. In these matters the Protestant churches have\r\nadvanced much farther.\r\n\r\nIt was very different when Huxley wrote. The first and gravest\r\ndifficulty placed in the way of science was the asserted infallibility\r\nof the Scriptures. In Catholic theology, at least until late in this\r\ncentury, the general tendency has been to regard the Bible rather as a\r\nquarry for doctrine than as a direct means of grace. The theory of\r\nreligion rested on two pillars: the inspired Scriptures containing the\r\nnecessary information and the inspired Church to interpret the\r\nScriptures. Protestant theology had rejected the infallible\r\ninspiration of the Church, and, in consequence, had thrown a greater\r\nburden on the Scriptures. The Scriptures became the Word of God,\r\nverbally and literally true; in its extreme form this doctrine\r\nreverted almost to the ancient Rabbinical maxim that even the vowel\r\npoints and accents were of divine origin. In practice, if not in\r\ntheory, the halo was extended to cover even the marginal chronology,\r\nthen a familiar feature in the editions of the English Bible. The\r\npresent writer, even so lately as in 1888 was reproved with violence\r\nby a clergyman of considerable education and position for expressing a\r\ndoubt as to the accuracy of these dates. Obviously there was no common\r\nmeasure between a church holding such views and advancing science. War\r\nwas inevitable, until one side or the other should give way.\r\n\r\nHuxley conducted the attack in a series of controversies extending\r\nover many years, and in which his opponents were well-known laymen\r\nsuch as Mr. Gladstone, Dr. St. George Mivart, the Duke of Argyll, and\r\nmany clerical dignitaries of different denominations. The most\r\nimportant of his contributions to these controversies, as well as\r\nseveral isolated essays and addresses, have been collected in two\r\nvolumes, _Science and the Hebrew Tradition_, and _Science and the\r\nChristian Tradition_.\r\n\r\nThe first stage in the controversy, and the stage most immediately\r\npressing, was to shew that the Bible was misleading and inaccurate as\r\na record of scientific fact, and that therefore it could not be\r\nbrought forward as evidence against scientific doctrines supported by\r\nscientific evidence. The vital matter in this was the account given in\r\nGenesis of the origin of the world. If that disappeared then the whole\r\nground was gained; science would be left free in its own sphere.\r\n\r\nIn a lecture on Evolution, delivered in 1876, Huxley began by\r\ndiscussing the possibilities as to the past history of nature. He\r\nbelieved that there were only three hypotheses which had been\r\nentertained or which well could be entertained respecting this\r\nhistory. The first was to assume that phenomena of nature similar to\r\nthose exhibited by the world at present had always existed; in fact\r\nthat the universe had existed from all eternity in what might be\r\ntermed, broadly, its present condition. The second hypothesis was that\r\nthe present condition of things had had only a limited duration, and\r\nthat, at some period of the past, what we now know came into existence\r\nwithout any relation of natural causation to an antecedent state. The\r\nthird hypothesis also assumed that the present condition of things had\r\nhad a limited duration, but it supposed that that condition had been\r\nderived by natural processes from an antecedent condition, the\r\nhypothesis attempting to set no limits to the series of changes.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense, the first hypothesis recalls the doctrine of\r\nuniformitarianism, which Hutton and Lyell had shaped from a rational\r\ninterpretation of the present conditions of nature. But, although it\r\nis no longer necessary to imagine the past history of the earth as a\r\nseries of gigantic catastrophes, yet the whole record of science is\r\nagainst the supposition that anything like the existing state of\r\nnature has had an eternal duration. The record of fossils shews that\r\nthe living population of the earth has been entirely different at\r\ndifferent epochs. Geological history shews that, whether these changes\r\nhave come about by swift catastrophes, or by slow, enduring movements,\r\nthe surface of the globe, its distribution into land and water, the\r\ncharacter of these areas and the conditions of climate to which they\r\nhave been subjected have passed through changes on a colossal scale.\r\nMoreover, if we look from this earth to the universe of stars and suns\r\nand planets, we see everywhere evidence of unceasing change. If we use\r\nscientific observation and reason, if we employ on the problem the\r\nonly means we possess for attempting its solution, we cannot accept\r\nthe hypothesis that the present condition of nature has been eternal.\r\n\r\n     \"So far as that limited revelation of the nature of things, which\r\n     we call scientific knowledge, has yet gone, it tends, with\r\n     constantly increasing emphasis, to the belief that, not merely\r\n     the world of plants, but that of animals; not merely living\r\n     things but the whole fabric of the earth; not merely our planet\r\n     but the whole solar system, not merely our star and its\r\n     satellites, but the millions of similar bodies which bear witness\r\n     to the order which pervades boundless space and has endured\r\n     through boundless time, are all working out their predestined\r\n     courses of evolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe second hypothesis is familiar to us in the sacred records of many\r\nreligious and in the Hebrew Scriptures. Most of these have a\r\nfundamental similarity, inasmuch as they offer pictures in which the\r\nmode and order of creation are given in the minutest detail and with\r\nthe simplest kind of anthropomorphism; in which the Creator is\r\nrepresented with familiar human characteristics. But these general\r\nconsiderations, so obvious now that we have learned to read the Bible\r\nnarrative without passion or prejudice, were not plain to the early\r\nopponents of evolution, and it was necessary, step by step, to shew\r\nnot only that the narrative in Genesis could not be reconciled with\r\nknown facts if it were accepted in its literal meaning, but that the\r\nmost strained interpretation of the language failed to bring it into\r\naccordance with scientific truth. Mr. Gladstone was the latest and\r\nmost vigorous of those who attempted to reconcile Genesis with modern\r\nknowledge, and in his controversy with Huxley he brought to bear all\r\nthe resources of an acute intellect trained by long practice in the\r\ndevices of argument and inspired by a lofty if mistaken enthusiasm. In\r\nthe course of his argument he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"But the question is not here of a lofty poem, or a skilfully\r\n     constructed narrative; it is whether natural science, in the\r\n     patient exercise of its high calling to examine facts, finds that\r\n     the works of God cry out against what we have fondly believed to\r\n     be His word and tell another tale; or whether, in this nineteenth\r\n     century of Christian progress, it substantially echoes back the\r\n     majestic sound, which, before it existed as a pursuit, went forth\r\n     into all lands.\r\n\r\n      First, looking largely at the latter portion of the narrative,\r\n     which describes the creation of living organisms, and waiving\r\n     details, on some of which (as in v. 24) the Septuagint seems to\r\n     vary from the Hebrew, there is a grand fourfold division, set\r\n     forth in an orderly succession of times as follows: on the fifth\r\n     day\r\n         1. The water-population.\r\n         2. The air-population,\r\n      and, on the sixth day,\r\n         3. The land-population of animals.\r\n         4. The land-population consummated in man.\r\n\r\n      Now this same fourfold order is understood to have been so\r\n     affirmed in our time by natural science, that it may be taken as\r\n     a demonstrated conclusion and established fact.\"\r\n\r\nThe defence itself shewed that already a large part of the original\r\nposition had been abandoned. The literal meaning and belief in\r\ndetailed accuracy were given up and Mr. Gladstone sought to establish\r\nonly a general correspondence between the Biblical narrative and the\r\nresults of science. But even in that form Huxley shewed the defence to\r\nbe untenable.\r\n\r\n     \"I can meet the statement in the last paragraph of the above\r\n     citation,\" he replied, \"with nothing but a direct negative. If I\r\n     know anything at all about the results attained by the natural\r\n     science of our time, it is a 'demonstrated conclusion and\r\n     established fact' that the fourfold order given by Mr. Gladstone\r\n     is not that in which the evidence at our disposal tends to shew\r\n     that the water, air, and land populations of our globe made their\r\n     appearance.\"\r\n\r\nWith the most voluminous detail, he proceeds to shew that there is no\r\npossible relation between the order implied by the narrative and the\r\norder as revealed by science. Let us sum up, by two quotations, the\r\nresult of the whole controversy. First, the literal meaning is\r\nuntenable.\r\n\r\n     \"The question whether the earth and the immediate progenitors of\r\n     its present living population were made in six natural days or\r\n     not is no longer one on which two opinions can be held. The fact\r\n     that it did not come so into being stands upon as sound a basis\r\n     as any fact of history whatever. It is not true that existing\r\n     plants and animals came into being within three days of the\r\n     creation of the earth out of nothing, for it is certain that\r\n     innumerable generations of other plants and animals lived upon\r\n     the earth before its present population. And when, Sunday after\r\n     Sunday, men who profess to be our instructors in righteousness\r\n     read out the statement, 'In six days the Lord made heaven and\r\n     earth, the sea, and all that in them is,' in innumerable\r\n     churches, they are either propagating what they may easily know,\r\n     and, therefore, are bound to know, to be falsities; or, if they\r\n     use the words in some non-natural sense, they fall below the\r\n     moral standard of the much abused Jesuit.\"\r\n\r\nThe attenuated meaning equally must be given up.\r\n\r\n     \"Even if they (the reconcilers) now allow that the words 'the\r\n     evening and the morning' have not the least reference to a\r\n     natural day, but mean a period of any number of millions of years\r\n     that may be necessary; even if they are driven to admit that the\r\n     word 'creation,' which so many millions of pious Jews and\r\n     Christians have held, and still hold, to mean a sudden act of the\r\n     Deity, signifies a process of gradual evolution of one species\r\n     from another, extending through immeasurable time; even if they\r\n     are willing to grant that the asserted coincidence of the order\r\n     of nature with the 'fourfold order' ascribed to Genesis is an\r\n     obvious error instead of an established truth, they are surely\r\n     prepared to make a last stand upon the conception which underlies\r\n     the whole, and which constitutes the essence of Mr. Gladstone's\r\n     'fourfold division, set forth in an orderly succession of times.'\r\n     It is that the animal species which compose the water-population,\r\n     the air-population, and the land-population, respectively,\r\n     originated during three distinct and successive periods of time,\r\n     and only during these periods of time.... But even this\r\n     sublimated essence of the Pentateuchal doctrine remains as\r\n     discordant with natural science as ever.\"\r\n\r\nThere remains the third, or evolutionary hypothesis regarding the\r\norigin of the existing order of nature. As Huxley held it, it was\r\nrigidly limited within the possibilities afforded by the agnostic\r\nattitude. With regard to the real nature, the origin and destiny of\r\nthe whole universe, there was not sufficient evidence before the human\r\nmind, if indeed the human mind were capable of receiving such\r\nevidence, to come to any conclusion. For the rest, for the actual\r\ncondition of the earth itself, science was gradually accumulating\r\noverwhelming evidence in favour of a continuous evolution, under\r\nnatural agencies, from the beginning of life to the existing forms of\r\nanimals and plants, and the actual origin of life from inorganic\r\nmatter under similarly natural agencies was becoming more and more a\r\nlegitimate inference.\r\n\r\nHuxley's relation to the New Testament may be summed up in few words.\r\nIt was simply that there was not sufficient evidence for ascribing to\r\nit the supernatural sanction demanded for it by dogmatic theology.\r\n\r\n     \"From the dawn of scientific Biblical criticism until the present\r\n     day, the evidence against the long-cherished notion that the\r\n     three synoptic gospels are the work of three independent authors,\r\n     each prompted by Divine inspiration, has steadily accumulated,\r\n     until, at the present time, there is no visible escape from the\r\n     conclusion that each of the three is a compilation consisting of\r\n     a groundwork common to all three--the three-fold tradition; and\r\n     of a superstructure consisting, firstly, of matter common to it\r\n     with one of the others, and, secondly, of matter common to each.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\"There is no proof, nothing more than a fair presumption, that\r\nany one of the gospels existed, in the state in which we find it in\r\nthe authorised version of the Bible, before the second century, or, in\r\nother words, sixty or seventy years after the events recorded.\" These\r\nconsiderations with slight differences in details are now practically\r\nadmitted among the abler apologists, with the result that, as Huxley\r\nclaimed, the New Testament, like the Old, must be treated as\r\nliterature rather than as Dogma. As Literature everyone has the right\r\nto examine the contents critically, and, considering the importance\r\nattributed to the contents, the right becomes a duty. No doubt, had\r\nHuxley not lived there would have been others equally ready and\r\nequally able to gain the battle for freedom of thought in its special\r\napplication to the claim of the Bible to stand in the way of the\r\nadvance of scientific knowledge; but as it is, it cannot be denied\r\nthat the existing prevalence of liberal views, inside and outside the\r\nchurches, on the nature and interpretation of the Scriptures is\r\nlargely due to him.\r\n\r\nAfter the question of inspiration, the most striking feature of the\r\nBible is its appeal to miracles and the miraculous element. It is now\r\nnecessary to examine the position assumed by Huxley towards these. Two\r\ngreat _a priori_ difficulties have been brought against accepting any\r\nrecord of miracles as true. The first of these is very simple,\r\ndepending on the history of all times and peoples. It is that the\r\nhuman race has shewn itself universally credulous in this matter. It\r\nhas cried \"Wolf!\" so readily, so honestly, and on so many occasions\r\nthat the cry has ceased to carry conviction with it. Every religion\r\nhas its series of miraculous events; every savage tribe and every\r\nuneducated race has its miracle-workers implicitly accepted. In\r\nmediæval and modern Europe up to our own times, miracles have been so\r\nconstantly recorded on testimony of such undoubted integrity that we\r\nmust either believe that miracles can be performed by numberless\r\npersons with no other claim to special regard, or that it is\r\nsingularly easy to get false but honest evidence regarding them.\r\nHuxley supported the latter alternative strongly, and held the view\r\nthat to believe in any particular miracles would require evidence very\r\nmuch more direct and very much stronger than would be necessary in the\r\ncase of inherently probable events.\r\n\r\nThe second _a priori_ objection to the credibility of miracles has\r\nbeen urged more strongly, but was not accepted by Huxley. It is that\r\nmiracles are inherently incredible inasmuch as they are \"violations of\r\nthe order of nature.\" Hume, attacking miracles, had made this\r\nobjection the chief ground of his argument. Huxley paid a logical\r\nrespect, at least as great, to the continuity of nature.\r\n\r\n     \"When the experience of generation after generation is recorded,\r\n     and a single book tells us more than Methuselah could have\r\n     learned, had he spent every waking hour of his thousand years in\r\n     learning; when apparent disorders are found to be only the\r\n     recurrent pulses of a slow-working order, and the wonder of a\r\n     year becomes the commonplace of a century; when repeated and\r\n     minute examination never reveals a break in the chain of causes\r\n     and effects; and the whole edifice of practical life is built\r\n     upon our faith in its continuity; the belief that that chain has\r\n     never been broken and will never be broken, becomes one of the\r\n     strongest and most justifiable of human convictions. And it must\r\n     be admitted to be a reasonable request, if we ask those who would\r\n     have us put faith in the actual occurrence of interruptions of\r\n     that order, to produce evidence in favour of their view, not only\r\n     equal, but superior, in weight, to that which leads us to adopt\r\n     ours.\"\r\n\r\nBut out of the mouth of Hume himself he declared against making the\r\nrecorded experience of man, however lengthy and impressive, a\r\nnecessary ground for rejecting the possibility of the miraculous. Hume\r\nhad said, \"Whatever is intelligible and can be distinctly conceived\r\nimplies no contradiction, and can never be proved false by any\r\ndemonstration, argument, or reasoning, _a priori_.\" This or the like\r\napplies to most of the recorded miracles. Huxley was extremely careful\r\nnot to assert that they were incredible merely because they might\r\ninvolve conditions outside our existing experience. It is a vulgar\r\nmistake, for which science certainly gives no warrant, to assert that\r\nthings are impossible because they contradict our experience. In such\r\na sense many of the most common modern conveniences of life would have\r\nseemed impossible a century ago. To travel with safety sixty miles an\r\nhour, to talk through the telephone with a friend an hundred miles\r\naway, to receive intelligible messages across the Atlantic by a cable,\r\nand, still more, to communicate by wireless telegraphy would have\r\nseemed impossible until recently. At the present time, the conversion\r\nof a baser metal into gold would be called impossible by everyone with\r\na little knowledge of elementary chemistry. This last example leads\r\nadmirably to a right understanding of the scientific view of\r\nimpossibility. The older alchemists, partly from ignorance and partly\r\nfrom credulity, believed absolutely in the possibility of transmuting\r\nthe metals. The advance of chemical science led to definite\r\nconceptions of the differences between compounds and elementary\r\nbodies, and of the independence of these elements. The methods and\r\nreasoning of the alchemists became absurd, and no one would attempt\r\nseriously to transmute the metals on their lines. These advances,\r\nhowever, do not give us the right to assume that the elements are\r\nabsolutely independent, and that transmutation is therefore\r\nimpossible. Some of the most recent progress in chemistry has opened\r\nup the suggestion that the elements themselves are different\r\ncombinations of a common substance. Huxley applied this particular\r\nargument to the miracle at the marriage of Cana.\r\n\r\n     \"You are quite mistaken in supposing that anybody who is\r\n     acquainted with the possibilities of physical science will\r\n     undertake categorically to deny that water may be turned into\r\n     wine. Many very competent judges are inclined to think that the\r\n     bodies which we have hitherto regarded as elementary are really\r\n     composite arrangements of the particles of a uniform primitive\r\n     matter. Supposing that view to be correct, there would be no more\r\n     theoretical difficulty about turning water into alcohol, ethereal\r\n     and colouring matters, than there is, at this present moment, any\r\n     practical difficulty in working other such miracles; as when we\r\n     turn sugar into alcohol, carbonic acid, glycerine, and succinic\r\n     acid; or transmute gas-refuse into perfumes rarer than musk and\r\n     dyes richer than Tyrian purple.\"\r\n\r\nUnless we make the unscientific and preposterous assumption that our\r\npresent knowledge of nature and of natural forces is absolute and\r\ncomplete, it is unscientific and illogical to declare at once that any\r\nsupposed events could not have happened merely because they seem to\r\nhave contradicted so-called natural laws.\r\n\r\n     \"Strictly speaking,\" Huxley wrote, \"I am unaware of anything that\r\n     has a right to the title of an 'impossibility' except a\r\n     contradiction in terms. There are impossibilities logical, but\r\n     none natural. A 'round square,' a 'present past,' 'two parallel\r\n     lines that intersect,' are impossibilities, because the ideas\r\n     denoted by the predicates, round, present, intersect, are\r\n     contradictory of the ideas denoted by the subjects, square, past,\r\n     parallel. But walking on water, or turning water into wine, or\r\n     procreation without male intervention, or raising the dead, are\r\n     plainly not impossibilities in this sense.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole matter turns on the question of sufficient evidence.\r\n\r\n     \"Hume's arguments resolve themselves into a simple statement of\r\n     the dictates of common sense which may be expressed in this\r\n     canon: the more a statement of fact conflicts with previous\r\n     experience, the more complete must be the evidence which is to\r\n     justify us in believing it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, expressing the same idea in different words, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Nobody can presume to say what the order of nature must be; all\r\n     that the widest experience (even if it extended over all past\r\n     time and through all space) that events had happened in a certain\r\n     way could justify, would be a proportionately strong expectation\r\n     that events will go on so happening, and the demand for a\r\n     proportional strength of evidence in favour of any assertion that\r\n     they had happened otherwise. It is this weighty consideration,\r\n     the truth of which everyone who is capable of logical thought\r\n     must surely admit, which knocks the bottom out of all _a priori_\r\n     objections either to ordinary 'miracles' or to the efficacy of\r\n     prayer, in so far as the latter implies the miraculous\r\n     intervention of a higher power. No one is entitled to say, _a\r\n     priori_, that prayer for some change in the ordinary course of\r\n     nature cannot possibly avail.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a question of evidence, and not only did the evidence not\r\nconvince Huxley, but the thaumaturgic nature of the Biblical miracles\r\nprovided him with additional reason for refusing to attach any\r\nextrinsic value to the contents of the book.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, although he declined to accept the Bible as a\r\nmiraculous and authentic revelation, again and again he expressed\r\nhimself in the strongest terms as to its value to mankind, and as to\r\nthe impossibility of any scientific advance diminishing in any way\r\nwhatsoever that value.\r\n\r\n     \"The antagonism between religion and science, about which we hear\r\n     so much, appears to me to be purely factitious--fabricated, on\r\n     the one hand, by shortsighted religious people who confound a\r\n     certain branch of science, theology, with religion; and, on the\r\n     other, by equally shortsighted scientific people who forget that\r\n     science takes for its province only that which is susceptible of\r\n     clear intellectual comprehension; and that, outside the\r\n     boundaries of that province, they must be content with\r\n     imagination, with hope, and with ignorance.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again;\r\n\r\n     \"In the eighth century B.C., in the heart of a world of\r\n     idolatrous polytheists, the Hebrew prophets put forth a\r\n     conception of religion which appears to me to be as wonderful an\r\n     inspiration of genius as the art of Pheidias or the science of\r\n     Aristotle. 'And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do\r\n     justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?' If\r\n     any so-called religion takes away from this great saying of\r\n     Micah, I think it wantonly mutilates, while if it adds thereto, I\r\n     think it obscures, the perfect ideal of religion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nETHICS OF THE COSMOS\r\n\r\n     Conduct and Metaphysics--Conventional and Critical Minds--Good\r\n     and Evil--Huxley's Last Appearance at Oxford--The Ethical Process\r\n     and the Cosmic Process--Man's Intervention--The Cosmic Process\r\n     Evil--Ancient Reconciliations--Modern Acceptance of the\r\n     Difficulties--Criticism of Huxley's Pessimism--Man and his\r\n     Ethical Aspirations Part of the Cosmos.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Huxley refused to acquiesce in the current orthodox\r\ndoctrine that our systems of morality rested on a special revelation,\r\nmiraculous in its origin, and vouched for by the recorded miracles of\r\nits Founder, or by those entrusted by the Founder with miraculous\r\npower. He supported the view that, historically and actually, there is\r\nno necessary connection between religion and morality. The one is an\r\nattempt, in his opinion always unsuccessful, to lift the veil from the\r\nunseen, to know the unknowable; the other is simply the code that\r\nsocial man, through the ages, has elaborated for his own guidance, and\r\nproved by his own experience. So far as the conduct of life goes, the\r\nmorality of one who accepts the agnostic position with regard to\r\nrevelation and the unseen universe differs in no respect from the code\r\ntaken under the protection of the modern forms of religion. As John\r\nMorley, in his _Essay on Voltaire_ wrote of such a person:\r\n\r\n     \"There are new solutions for him, if the old have fallen dumb. If\r\n     he no longer believe death to be a stroke from the sword of God's\r\n     justice, but the leaden footfall of an inflexible law of matter,\r\n     the humility of his awe is deepened, and the tenderness of his\r\n     pity made holier, that creatures who can love so much should have\r\n     their days so shut round with a wall of darkness. The purifying\r\n     anguish of remorse will be stronger, not weaker, when he has\r\n     trained himself to look upon every wrong in thought, every duty\r\n     omitted from act, each infringement of the inner spiritual law\r\n     which humanity is constantly perfecting for its own guidance and\r\n     advantage, less as a breach of the decrees of an unseen tribunal\r\n     than as an ungrateful infection weakening and corrupting the\r\n     future of his brothers.\"\r\n\r\nBut there are wider questions than the immediate problems of conduct. A\r\ncertain type of mind finds it almost impossible not to attempt ethical\r\njudgments on the whole universe, not to speculate whether the Cosmos, as\r\nwe can imagine it from the part of it within the cognisance of man,\r\noffers a spectacle of moral or immoral or of non-moral significance. In\r\nthe old times of Greece and in the modern world many have been devoid of\r\nthe taste for argument on such subjects. Those who are uninterested in\r\nthese abstract discussions are rarely in opposition to the mode of faith\r\nsurrounding them, as to reject the doctrines held by the majority of\r\none's friends and associates implies either a disagreeable disposition\r\nor an unusual interest in ultimate problems; they are usually orthodox\r\naccording to their environment--Stoics, Epicureans, Jews, Episcopalians,\r\nCatholics, Quakers, Methodists, Mormons, Mohammedans, Buddhists, or\r\nwhatever may be the prevailing dogma around them. The attitude of\r\nindifference to moral philosophy has practically no relation to what may\r\nbe considered good or bad moral conduct; those characterised by it live\r\nabove or below or round about their own moral standards in a fashion as\r\nvariable as that of moral philosophers. Many of the saints, ancient and\r\nmodern, have been notorious instances; question them as to their faith\r\nor as to the logical foundation of their renunciations and they will\r\ntell you in simple honesty or make it plain by their answers that they\r\nhave no head for logic, that they cannot argue, but only know and feel\r\ntheir position to be true. In addition to the saints, many of the best\r\nand most of the pleasant people in the world are of this type.\r\n\r\nThe type strongly in contrast with the foregoing is found in persons\r\nof a more strenuous, perhaps more admirable but less agreeable\r\ncharacter. The savour of acerbity may be a natural attribute of the\r\ncritical character, and it is certainly not lessened where moral\r\nphilosophy is the subject-matter of the criticism. The continual\r\nsearch after solutions of problems that may be insoluble at least\r\nmakes the seekers excellent judges of wrong solutions. Like Luther and\r\nLoyola and Kant, they may be able to satisfy themselves, or, like\r\nHuxley, they may remain in doubt, but in either case they are\r\nexcellent critics of the solutions of others. They are the firebrands\r\nof faith or of negation; they are possessed by an intellectual fury\r\nthat will not let them cease from propagandising. They must go through\r\nthe world as missionaries; and the missionary spirit is dual, one side\r\nzealous to proclaim the new, the other equally zealous to denounce the\r\nold. But theirs is the great work, \"to burn old falsehood bare,\" to\r\ntear away the incrustations of time which people have come to accept\r\nas the thing itself, and in their track new and lively truth springs\r\nup, as fresh green follows the devastations of fire.\r\n\r\nTo most of us it seems of sufficient importance and of sufficient\r\ndifficulty to make our decisions in the little eddies of good and evil\r\nthat form as the world-stream breaks round our individual lives.\r\nHuxley strove to interpret the world-stream itself, to translate its\r\nmovements into the ethical language of man. As knowledge of the forces\r\nand movements of the Cosmos has increased so has our general\r\nconception been intensified, our conception of it as a wondrous\r\ndisplay of power and grandeur and superhuman fixity of order. But are\r\nthe forces of the Cosmos good or evil? Are we, and the Cosmos of which\r\nwe are a part, the sport of changeable and capricious deities, the\r\npawns in a game of the gods, as some of the Greeks held; or of a power\r\ndrunkenly malicious, as Heine once cynically suggested; or a\r\nbattle-ground for a force of good and a force of evil as in so many\r\nEastern religions? Are we dominated by pure evil, as some dark creeds\r\nhave held, or by pure good, as the religion of the Western world\r\nteaches? And if we are dominated by pure evil, whence come good and\r\nthe idea of good, or, if by pure good, whence evil and the idea of\r\nevil?\r\n\r\nHuxley's interest in these great problems appears and reappears\r\nthroughout his published writings, but his views are most clearly and\r\nsystematically exposed in his \"Romanes\" lecture on \"Evolution and\r\nEthics\" delivered and published at Oxford in 1894, and afterwards\r\nrepublished with a prefatory essay in the last volume of his\r\n_Collected Essays_. Not long before his death, Professor Romanes, who\r\nhad come to live in Oxford, founded a University lectureship, the\r\npurpose of which was that once a year a distinguished man should\r\naddress the University on a subject neither religious nor political.\r\nMr. Gladstone was the first lecturer, and, at the suggestion of the\r\nfounder, Huxley was chosen as the second. For years he had been taking\r\na special interest in both religion and politics, and he was not a\r\nlittle embarrassed by the restrictions imposed by the terms of the\r\nfoundation, for he determined to make ethical science the subject of\r\nhis address, and\r\n\r\n     \"ethical science is, on all sides, so entangled with religion and\r\n     politics, that the lecturer who essays to touch the former\r\n     without coming in contact with either of the latter, needs all\r\n     the dexterity of an egg-dancer, and may even discover that his\r\n     sense of clearness and his sense of propriety come into conflict,\r\n     by no means to the advantage of the former.\"\r\n\r\nAs Huxley, on that great occasion, ascended the rostrum in the\r\nSheldonian theatre, very white and frail in his scarlet doctor's\r\nrobes, there must have been present in his mind memories of the\r\noccasion, four-and-thirty years before, when he first addressed an\r\naudience in the University of Oxford. Then he was a young man, almost\r\nunknown, rising to lead what seemed a forlorn hope for an idea utterly\r\nrepugnant to most of his hearers. Now, and largely by his own efforts,\r\nthe idea had become an inseparable part of human thought, and Huxley\r\nhimself was the guest to whom the whole University was doing honour.\r\nGraduates from all parts of England had come to hear what, it was\r\nfeared, might be his last public speech, and practically every member\r\nof the University who could gain admission was present. The press of\r\nthe world attended to report his words as if they were those of a\r\ngreat political leader, about to decide the fate of nations. Although\r\nhis voice had lost much of its old sonorous reach, and although the\r\nold clear rhythms were occasionally broken by hesitancies, the magic\r\nof his personality oriented to him every face.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious and striking circumstance, a circumstance fully\r\nrecognised by Huxley himself, that in this exposition of his ethical\r\nconception of the Cosmos he reconstructed, on the lines of his\r\nevolutionary philosophy one of the oldest and most widespread\r\ntheories, a theory again and again reached by men of different\r\ncivilisations and epochs. Manes, the Persian, from whose name the word\r\n\"Manicheism\" has been coined to denote his doctrine, taught in perhaps\r\nthe most explicit fashion that the Cosmos was the battle-ground of two\r\ncontending powers,--Ahriman, the principle of evil, and Ormuzd, the\r\nprinciple of good. This doctrine in some form or other is implicit in\r\nmost of the greater religions, some of which have assumed an ultimate\r\ntriumph for the principle of good, while others have left the issue\r\ndoubtful. The Ahriman of Huxley, the principle of evil, is what he\r\ntermed the cosmic process, that great play of forces, by which, in a\r\nruthless struggle for existence, the fittest (by which is meant the\r\nmost suited to the surrounding conditions and not necessarily the\r\nethically best) have survived at the expense of the less fit. The\r\nOrmuzd, the principle of good, is what Huxley called the Ethical\r\nprocess, the process by which sentient, intelligent, and moral man has\r\nstriven to replace the \"old ape and tiger methods\" of the cosmic\r\nprocess, by methods in which justice and mercy, sacrifice and\r\nconsideration for others have a part.\r\n\r\nTo explain clearly the distinction he made between the ethical and\r\ncosmic processes. Huxley, in the prefatory essay (\"Prolegomena\")\r\npublished in the volume with his Romanes lecture, developed the\r\nanalogy of a cultivated garden reclaimed from surrounding wild nature.\r\nHe described how the countryside, visible from his windows at\r\nEastbourne, had certainly been in a \"state of nature\" about two\r\nthousand years ago when Cæsar had set foot in Britain and had made the\r\nRoman camps, the remains of which still mark the chalk downs of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n     \"Except, it may be, by raising a few sepulchral mounds, such as\r\n     those which still, here and there, break the flowing contours of\r\n     the Downs, man's hands had made no mark upon it; and the thin\r\n     veil of vegetation which overspread the broad-backed heights and\r\n     the shelving sides of the coombs was unaffected by his industry.\r\n     The native grasses and weeds, the scattered patches of gorse,\r\n     contended with one another for possession of the scanty surface\r\n     soil; they fought against the droughts of summer, the frosts of\r\n     winter, and the furious gales, which swept with unbroken force,\r\n     now from the Atlantic, and now from the North Sea, at all times\r\n     of the year; they filled up, as they best might, the gaps made in\r\n     their ranks by all sorts of overground and underground ravagers.\r\n     One year with another, an average population, the floating\r\n     balance of the unceasing struggle for existence among the\r\n     indigenous plants, maintained itself. It is as little to be\r\n     doubted that an essentially similar state of nature prevailed in\r\n     this region for many thousand years before the coming of Cæsar;\r\n     and there is no assignable reason for denying that it might\r\n     continue to exist through an equally prolonged futurity except\r\n     for the intervention of man.\"\r\n\r\nThis present state of nature, he explained, is only a fleeting phase\r\nof a process that has gone on for millions of years. Under the thin\r\nlayer of soil are the chalk cliffs, hundreds of feet thick and\r\nwitnesses of the entirely different phases of the struggle that went\r\non while the cliffs were being formed at the bottom of the chalk sea,\r\nwhen the vegetation of the nearest land was as different from the\r\nexisting vegetation as that is different from the trees and flowers of\r\nan African forest.\r\n\r\n     \"Before the deposition of the chalk, a vastly longer period\r\n     elapsed, throughout which it is easy to follow the traces of the\r\n     same process of ceaseless modification and of the same\r\n     internecine struggle for existence of living things; and when we\r\n     can go no further back, it is not because there is any reason to\r\n     think we have reached the beginning, but because the trail of the\r\n     most ancient life remains hidden or has become obliterated.\"\r\n\r\nThe state of nature, then, is a fleeting and impermanent process.\r\n\r\n     \"That which endures is not one or other association of living\r\n     forms, but the process of which the Cosmos is the product and of\r\n     which these are among the transitory expressions. And in the\r\n     living world, one of the most characteristic features of this\r\n     cosmic process is the struggle for existence, the competition of\r\n     each with all, the result of which is the selection, that is to\r\n     say, the survival of those forms which, on the whole, are best\r\n     adapted to the conditions which at any period obtain; and which\r\n     are, therefore, in that respect, and only in that respect, the\r\n     fittest. The acme reached by the cosmic process in the vegetation\r\n     of the Downs is seen in the turf with its weeds and gorse. Under\r\n     the conditions, they have come out of the struggle victorious;\r\n     and, by surviving, have proved that they are the fittest to\r\n     survive.\"\r\n\r\nFor three or four years, the state of nature in a small portion of the\r\nDowns surrounding Huxley's house had been put an end to by the\r\nintervention of man.\r\n\r\n     \"The patch was cut off from the rest by a wall; within the area\r\n     thus protected the native vegetation was, as far as possible,\r\n     extirpated, while a colony of strange plants was imported and set\r\n     down in its place. In short, it was made into a garden. This\r\n     artificially treated area presents an aspect extraordinarily\r\n     different from that of so much of the land as still remains in\r\n     the state of nature outside the wall. Trees, shrubs and herbs,\r\n     many of them appertaining to the state of nature in remote parts\r\n     of the globe, abound and flourish. Moreover, considerable\r\n     quantities of vegetables, fruit, and flowers are produced, of\r\n     kinds which neither now exist nor have ever existed except under\r\n     conditions such as obtain in the garden and which therefore are\r\n     as much works of the art of man as the frames and glass-houses in\r\n     which some of them are raised. That the 'state of art' thus\r\n     created in the state of nature by man, is sustained by and\r\n     dependent on him, would at once become apparent if the watchful\r\n     supervision of the gardener were withdrawn, and the antagonistic\r\n     influences of the general cosmic process were no longer\r\n     sedulously warded off, or counteracted.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to describe how, under such circumstances, the artificial\r\nbarriers would decay, and the delicate inhabitants of the garden would\r\nperish under the assaults of animal and vegetable foes. External\r\nforces would reassert themselves and wild nature would resume its\r\nsway. While, in a sense, he had strenuously advocated the unity of all\r\nnature, he found in it two rivals: the artificial products of sentient\r\nman and the forces and products of wild nature. These two he believed\r\nto be in inevitable opposition and to represent the good and the evil\r\nforces of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the dim ages of the past, the forces that have gone to the making\r\nof man have been part of the cosmic process. In the endless and\r\nwonderful series of kaleidoscopic changes by which, under the\r\noperation of natural laws, the body, habits, and the character of man\r\nhave been elaborated slowly from the natal dust, there is the widest\r\nfield for the operation of the most acute intelligence to study and\r\ntrace the stages in the process. But if intellectual delight in\r\nstudying the process be left out of account, a serious question at\r\nonce appears. In the higher stages of evolution the cosmic forces,\r\nceasing to act merely on insentient matter, have operated on sentient\r\nbeings, and in so doing have given rise to the mystery of pain and\r\nsuffering. When the less fit of chemical combinations or even of the\r\nlower forms of life perished in the struggle, we may regard the\r\nprocess with the unemotional eye of pure intelligence. But \"pain, the\r\nbaleful product of evolution, increases in quantity and in intensity\r\nwith advancing stages of animal organisation, until it attains its\r\nhighest level in man.\" And so it comes about that the cosmic process\r\nproduces evil, sorrow, and suffering. Consideration of the cosmic\r\nprocess leads up against the mystery of evil.\r\n\r\nHuxley argued that the various philosophies and civilisations of the\r\npast had led by different paths to a similar conclusion. The primitive\r\nethical codes of man were not unlike the compacts of a wolf-pack, the\r\nunderstanding to refrain from mutual attack during the chase of a\r\ncommon prey. Conceptions of this kind became arranged in codes and\r\ninvested with supernatural sanction. But in Hindustan and Ionia alike,\r\nmaterial prosperity, no doubt partly the result of the accepted codes,\r\nproduced culture of the intellect and culture of the pleasures. With\r\nthese came the \"beneficent demon, doubt, whose name is legion and who\r\ndwells amongst the tombs of old faiths.\" The doubting intellect,\r\nacting on the codes, produced the conception of justice-in-itself, of\r\nmerit as divorced from the effect of action on others, the abstract\r\nidea of goodness.\r\n\r\nThe old philosopher, turning from this new conception to the Cosmos,\r\nfound that incompatible with goodness. Suffering and sorrow, sunshine\r\nand rain, were distributed independently of merit. With Greek and\r\nSemite and Indian the conscience of man revolted against the moral\r\nindifference of nature. Instead of bringing in a verdict of guilty,\r\nthey attempted reconciliation in various ways. Indian speculation\r\ninvented or elaborated the theory of transmigration, in which the\r\nKarma or soul-character passed from individual to individual, the\r\nalgebraic sums of happiness in the whole chain being proportional to\r\nmerit. The Stoics were metaphysicians and imagined an immanent,\r\nomnipotent, and infinitely beneficent First Cause. Evil was\r\nincompatible with this, and so they held, against experience, that\r\neither it did not exist, or that it was inflicted for our benefit or\r\ndue to our fault. In one fashion or another, all the great systems of\r\nthought had recognised the antagonism and had attempted some\r\nexplanation of it. Huxley's view was that the modern world with its\r\nnew philosophy was only retreading the toil-worn paths of the old.\r\nScientific optimism was being replaced by a frank pessimism. Cosmic\r\nevolution might be accountable for both good and evil, but knowledge\r\nof it provided no better reason for choice of the good than did\r\nearlier speculation. The cosmic process was not only non-moral but\r\nimmoral; goodness did not lead to success in it, and laws and moral\r\nprecepts could only be addressed to the curbing of it.\r\n\r\nIn a sense these conclusions of Huxley seemed to lead to absolute\r\npessimism, but he offered some mitigating considerations. Society\r\nremains subject to the cosmic process, but the less as civilisation\r\nadvances and ethical man is the more ready to combat it. The history\r\nof civilisation shows that we have some hope of this, for \"when\r\nphysiology, psychology, ethics, and political science, now befogged by\r\ncrude anticipations and futile analogies, have emerged from their\r\nchildhood, they may work as much change on human affairs as the\r\nearlier-ripened physical sciences wrought on material progress.\" And\r\nso, remembering that the evil cosmic nature in us has the foothold of\r\nmillions of years, and never hoping to abandon sorrow and pain, we may\r\nyet, in the manhood of our race, accept our destiny, and, with clear\r\nand steady eyes, address ourselves to the task of living, that we and\r\nothers may live better.\r\n\r\nThese gloomy views come from Huxley with such weight and authority\r\nthat even in a sketch of his life and opinions it may be noticed that\r\nthey do not seem necessary deductions from the evolutionary conception\r\nof the world. The first count adduced against the cosmic process is\r\nits connection with suffering. It may be doubted, so far as the animal\r\nworld is concerned, if Huxley has not exaggerated the gravity of this.\r\nThe two greatest contributors to the modern conception of evolution\r\nare not in agreement with him. Alfred Russel Wallace wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"On the whole, then, we conclude that the popular idea of the\r\n     struggle for existence entailing misery and pain on the animal\r\n     world is the very reverse of the truth. What it really brings\r\n     about is the maximum of life and of the enjoyment of life with\r\n     the minimum of suffering and pain. Given the necessity of death\r\n     and reproduction--and without those there could have been no\r\n     progressive development of the animal world--and it is difficult\r\n     even to imagine a system by which a greater balance of happiness\r\n     could have been secured.\"\r\n\r\nThis view was evidently that also of Darwin himself, who thus\r\nconcluded his chapter on the struggle for existence: \"When we reflect\r\non this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief that\r\nthe war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death\r\nis generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy\r\nsurvive and multiply.\" As for man himself, though it be true that in\r\nhim the consummation of pain is reached, still this is no isolated\r\nfact of far-reaching ethical importance. It is in direct dependence on\r\nthe increased physical and mental development of man, and these are\r\nequally necessary for and equally susceptible to increased pleasure\r\nand increased happiness. It is not necessary to regard the cosmic\r\nprocess as evil. Even when man, in various ages, had elaborated the\r\nconception of abstract goodness, and had endeavoured to make his\r\njustice a doling out of reward and punishment according to merit, it\r\nwas not inevitable to bring in a verdict of guilty against the Cosmos.\r\nIt is quite true that, in all the ages, man has seen the sun shine on\r\nthe unjust as on the just. But it is an easy reflection that the world\r\ncould not turn round on individual merit, and if few are so guilty as\r\nto deserve the agonies of grief that may come to all, still fewer\r\ndeserve some of the simpler and more common joys of life. The\r\nconception that was implicit in the disciplines of the older\r\nphilosophies is still open to the philosophy of evolution. Behind it,\r\nas behind the \"self-hypnotised catalepsy of the devotee of Brahma,\"\r\nthe Buddhist aspirations to Nirvana, the _apatheia_ of the Stoics,\r\nthere may lie a recognition of the worthlessness of the individual: an\r\nequable acceptation of one's self as part of a process: a triumph of\r\nintelligence over selfishness. Finally, behind the sharp division made\r\nbetween man and the Cosmos, there still lurks one of the oldest and\r\nmost enduring fallacies of the world, a fallacy that Huxley himself\r\nspent a great part of his intellectual life in discovering and\r\nrouting. The fallacy is the conception of the Cosmos as something\r\nseparate and apart from man, as something through which he, however\r\nbriefly, passes. Thus Omar sang:\r\n\r\n    \"Myself, when young, did eagerly frequent\r\n    Doctor and saint, and heard great argument\r\n      About it and about: but evermore\r\n    Came out by the same door where in I went.\r\n\r\n    \"With them the seed of wisdom did I sow,\r\n    And with mine own hand wrought to make it grow;\r\n      And this was all the Harvest that I reaped--\r\n    'I came like Water, and like Wind I go.'\r\n\r\n    \"Into this Universe, and _Why_ not knowing\r\n    Nor _Whence_, like water willy-nilly flowing;\r\n      And out of it, like Wind along the Waste\r\n    I know not _Whither_, willy-nilly blowing.\"\r\n\r\nBut, the more profoundly does the conception of evolution lay hold of\r\nhuman thought, the more inevitable it becomes to recognise that man\r\nand all that is best in man--his aspirations, ideas, virtues, and\r\npractical and abstract justice and goodness--are just as much the\r\nproduct of the cosmic process and part of the Cosmos as the most\r\nsinister results of the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nCLOSING DAYS AND SUMMARY\r\n\r\n     Huxley's Life in London--Decennial\r\n     Periods--Ill-health--Retirement to Eastbourne--Death--Personal\r\n     Appearance--Methods of Work--Personal Characteristics--An\r\n     Inspirer of Others--His Influence in Science--A Naturalist by\r\n     Vocation--His Aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuxley's life followed the quiet and even tenor of that of a\r\nprofessional man of science and letters. The great adventure in it was\r\nhis youthful voyage on the _Rattlesnake_. That over, and his choice\r\nmade in favour of science as against medicine, he settled down in\r\nLondon. He married happily and shared in the common joys and sorrows\r\nof domestic life. Advancement came to him steadily, and, although he\r\nwas never rich, after the first few years of life in London, his\r\nincome was always adequate to his moderate needs. For the greater part\r\nof his working life, he lived actually in London, in the ordinary\r\nstyle and with the ordinary social enjoyments of a professional man.\r\nHis duties in connection with the Royal College of Science and with\r\nthe Geological Survey were not arduous but constant; his time was\r\nfully occupied with these, with his scientific and literary work, with\r\nthe business of scientific societies, with the occasional obligations\r\nof royal commissions, public boards, and lecturing engagements. The\r\nquiet routine of his life was diversified by many visits to provincial\r\ntowns to deliver lectures or addresses, by meetings of the British\r\nAssociation, by holidays in Switzerland, during which, with Tyndall,\r\nhe made special studies of the phenomena of glaciation, and in the\r\nusual Continental resorts, and by several trips to America.\r\n\r\nIn a rough-and-ready fashion, Huxley's active life may be broken into\r\na set of decennial periods, each with tolerably distinctive\r\ncharacters. The first period, roughly from 1850 to 1860, was almost\r\npurely scientific. It was occupied by his voyage, by his transition to\r\nscience as a career, his researches into the invertebrate forms of\r\nlife, the beginning of his palæontological investigations, and a\r\ncomparatively small amount of lecturing and literary work. The second\r\ndecennium still found him employed chiefly in research, vertebrate and\r\nextinct forms absorbing most of his attention. He was occupied\r\nactively with teaching, but the dominant feature of the decennium was\r\nhis assumption of the Darwinian doctrines. In connection with these\r\nlatter, his literary and lecturing work increased greatly, and the\r\nside issues of what was, in itself, purely a scientific controversy\r\nbegan to lead him into metaphysical and religious studies. The third\r\nperiod, from 1870 to 1880, was considerably different in character. He\r\nhad become the most prominent man in biological science in England, at\r\na time when biological science was attracting a quite unusual amount\r\nof scientific and public attention. Public honours and public duties,\r\nsome of them scientific, others general, began to crowd upon him, and\r\nthe time at his disposal for the quiet labours of investigation\r\nbecame rapidly more limited within this period. He was secretary of\r\nthe Royal Society, a member of the London School Board, president of\r\nthe British Association, Lord Rector at several universities, member\r\nof many royal commissions, government inspector of fisheries,\r\npresident of the Geological Society. In this multitude of duties it\r\nwas natural that the bulk of strictly scientific output was limited,\r\nbut, on the other hand, his literary output was much larger. Between\r\n1880 and 1890 he had reached the full maturity of a splendid\r\nreputation, and honours and duties pressed thick upon him. For part of\r\nthe time he was president of the Royal Society, the most distinguished\r\nposition to which a scientific man in England can attain, and he was\r\nheld by the general public at least in as high esteem as by his\r\nscientific contemporaries. A small amount of original scientific work\r\nstill appeared from his pen, but he was occupied chiefly with more\r\ngeneral contributions to thought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARICATURE OF HUXLEY DRAWN BY HIMSELF\r\nReproduced by permission from _Natural Science_, vol. vii., No. 46]\r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Huxley had never been robust. From his youth\r\nupwards he had been troubled by dyspepsia with its usual accompaniment\r\nof occasional fits of severe mental and physical depression. In 1872\r\nhe was compelled to take a long holiday in Egypt, and, although he\r\nreturned to resume full labour, it is doubtful if from that time\r\nonwards he recovered even the strength normal to him. In 1885, his\r\nill-health became grave; in the following years he had two attacks of\r\npleurisy, and symptoms of cardiac mischief became pressing. He\r\ngradually withdrew from his official posts, and, in 1890, retired to\r\nEastbourne, where he had built himself a house on the Downs. The more\r\nhealthy conditions and the comparative leisure he permitted himself\r\nhad a good effect, and he was able to write some of his most\r\nbrilliant essays and to make a few public appearances: at Oxford in\r\n1893, when he delivered the Romanes lecture; at the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in 1894, when he spoke on the vote of thanks to\r\nthe President, the Marquis of Salisbury; at the Royal Society in the\r\nsame year when he received the recently established \"Darwin Medal.\"\r\nEarly in the spring of 1895, he had a prostrating attack of influenza,\r\nand from that time until his death on June 29, 1895, he was an\r\ninvalid. He was buried in the Marylebone cemetery at Finchley, to the\r\nnorth of London.\r\n\r\nHuxley was of middle stature and rather slender build. His face, as\r\nProfessor Ray Lankester described it, was \"grave, black-browed, and\r\nfiercely earnest.\" His hair, plentiful and worn rather long, was black\r\nuntil in old age it became silvery white. He wore short side whiskers,\r\nbut shaved the rest of his face, leaving fully exposed an obstinate\r\nchin, and mobile lips, grim and resolute in repose, but capable of\r\nrelaxation into a smile of almost feminine charm.\r\n\r\nHe was a very hard worker and took little exercise. Professor Howes\r\ndescribes a typical day as occupied by lecture and laboratory work at\r\nthe College of Science until his hurried luncheon; then a cab-drive to\r\nthe Home Office for his work as Inspector of Fisheries; then a cab\r\nhome for an hour's work before dinner, and the evening after dinner\r\nspent in literary work or scientific reading. While at work, his whole\r\nattention was engrossed, and he disliked being disturbed. This\r\nabstraction of his attention is illustrated humorously by a story told\r\nby one of his demonstrators. Huxley was engaged in the investigations\r\nrequired for his book on the Crayfish, and his demonstrator came in to\r\nask a question about a codfish. \"Codfish?\" said Huxley; \"that's a\r\nvertebrate, isn't it? Ask me in a fortnight and I'll consider it.\"\r\nWhile at work he smoked almost continuously, and from time to time he\r\ntook a little relaxation, for the strains of a fiddle were\r\noccasionally heard from his room. Indeed he was devoted to music,\r\nregarding it as one of the highest of the æsthetic pleasures. He tells\r\nus himself:\r\n\r\n     \"When I was a boy, I was very fond of music, and I am so now; and\r\n     it so happened that I had the opportunity of hearing much good\r\n     music. Among other things, I had abundant opportunities of\r\n     hearing that great old master, Sebastian Bach. I remember\r\n     perfectly well--although I knew nothing about music then, and, I\r\n     may add, know nothing whatever about it now--the intense\r\n     satisfaction and delight which I had in listening, by the hour\r\n     together, to Bach's fugues. It is a pleasure which remains with\r\n     me, I am glad to think; but, of late years, I have tried to find\r\n     out the why and wherefore, and it has often occurred to me that\r\n     the pleasure derived from musical compositions of this kind is\r\n     essentially of the same nature as that which is derived from\r\n     pursuits which are commonly regarded as purely intellectual. I\r\n     mean, that the source of pleasure is exactly the same as in most\r\n     of my problems in morphology--that you have the theme in one of\r\n     the old masters' works followed out in all its endless\r\n     variations, always appearing and always reminding you of unity in\r\n     variety.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a hot temper, and did not readily brook opposition, especially\r\nwhen that seemed to him to be the result of stupidity or of prejudice\r\nrather than of reason, and his own reason was of a very clear,\r\ndecided, and exact order. He had little sympathy with vacillation of\r\nany kind, whether it arose from mere infirmity of purpose or from the\r\ntemperament which delights in balancing opposing considerations. He\r\nsaid on one occasion:\r\n\r\n     \"A great lawyer-statesman and philosopher of a former age--I mean\r\n     Francis Bacon--said that truth came out of error much more\r\n     rapidly than out of confusion. There is a wonderful truth in that\r\n     saying. Next to being right in this world, the best of all things\r\n     is to be clearly and definitely wrong, because you will come out\r\n     somewhere. If you go buzzing about between right and wrong,\r\n     vibrating and fluctuating, you come out nowhere; but if you are\r\n     absolutely and thoroughly and persistently wrong, you must, some\r\n     of these days, have the extreme good fortune of knocking your\r\n     head against a fact, and that sets you all straight again. So I\r\n     will not trouble myself as to whether I may be right or wrong in\r\n     what I am about to say, but at any rate I hope to be clear and\r\n     definite; and then you will be able to judge for yourselves\r\n     whether, in following out the train of thought I have to\r\n     introduce, you knock your heads against facts or not.\"\r\n\r\nThe particular suggestions to which these remarks were the\r\ncharacteristic introduction related to definite problems of education,\r\nthat is to say, to questions upon which some action was urgent. It was\r\nin all cases of life, in science or affairs, that Huxley was resolute\r\nfor clear ideas and definite courses of conduct. As a matter of fact,\r\nno one ever took greater care to satisfy himself as best he could as\r\nto what was right and what was wrong; but where action rather than\r\nreflection was needed, then his principle was to act, and to know\r\ndefinitely and clearly why you acted and for what you acted. In\r\nmatters of opinion, on the other hand, he was all for not coming to a\r\ndefinite opinion when the facts obtainable did not justify such an\r\nopinion. In thought, agnosticism, the refusal to accept any ideas or\r\nprinciples except on sufficient evidence; in action, positivism, to\r\nact promptly in definite and known directions for definite and known\r\nobjects: these were his principles.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the same trait of character, he shewed in an address\r\nto medical students at a distribution of prizes. After congratulating\r\nthe victors he confessed to \"an undercurrent of sympathy for those who\r\nhave not been successful, for those valiant knights who have been\r\noverthrown in their tourney, and have not made their appearance in\r\npublic.\" After recounting an early failure of his own, he proceeded:\r\n\r\n     \"I said to myself, 'Never mind; what's the next thing to be\r\n     done?' And I found that policy of 'never minding' and going on to\r\n     the next thing to be done, to be the most important of all\r\n     policies in the conduct of practical life. It does not matter how\r\n     many tumbles you have in this life, so long as you do not get\r\n     dirty when you tumble; it is only the people who have to stop to\r\n     be washed and made clean, who must necessarily lose the race. You\r\n     learn that which is of inestimable importance--that there are a\r\n     great many people in the world who are just as clever as you are.\r\n     You learn to put your trust, by and by, in an economy and\r\n     frugality of the exercise of your powers both moral and\r\n     intellectual; and you very soon find out, if you have not found\r\n     it out before, that patience and tenacity of purpose are worth\r\n     more than twice their weight of cleverness.\"\r\n\r\nAll Huxley's work was marked by a quality which may be called\r\nconscientiousness or thoroughness. Looking through his memoirs,\r\nwritten many years ago, the subjects of which have since been handled\r\nand rehandled by other writers with new knowledge and with new methods\r\nat their disposal, one is struck that all the observations he made\r\nhave stood their ground. With new facts new generalisations have often\r\nbeen reached, and some of the positions occupied by Huxley have been\r\nturned. But what he saw and described had not to be redescribed; the\r\ncitations he made from the older authorities were always so chosen as\r\nto contain the exact gist of the writers. These qualities, admirable\r\nin scientific work, became at once admirable and terrible in his\r\ncontroversial writings. His own exactness made him ruthless in\r\nexposing any inexactness in his adversaries, and there were few\r\ndisputants who left an argument with Huxley in an undamaged condition.\r\nThe consciousness which he had of his own careful methods, added to a\r\nnatural pugnacity, gave him an intellectual courage of a very high\r\norder. As he knew himself to have made sure of his premisses, he did\r\nnot care whither his conclusions might lead him, against whatsoever\r\nestablished doctrine or accepted axiom.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a strong spice of natural combativeness in his\r\nnature, the direct result of his native and highly trained critical\r\nfaculty. He tells us that in the pre-Darwinian days he was accustomed\r\nto defend the fixity of species in the company of evolutionists and in\r\nthe presence of the orthodox to attack the same doctrine. Later in\r\nlife, when evolution had become fashionable, and the principles of\r\nDarwinism were being elevated into a new dogmatism, he was as ready to\r\ncriticise the loose adherents of his own views as he had been to\r\nexpose the weakness of the conventional dogmatists.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of Huxley's work as a whole was its\r\ninfectious nature. His vigorous and decided personality was reflected\r\non all the subjects to which he gave attention, and in the same\r\nfashion as his presence infected persons with a personal enthusiasm so\r\nhis writings stimulated readers to efforts along the same lines. His\r\ngreat influence is clear in the number and distinction of the\r\nbiologists who came under his personal care, and in the great army of\r\nwriters and thinkers who have been inspired by his views and methods\r\non general questions. His position as an actual contributor to science\r\nhas to a certain extent been lost sight of for two reasons. In the\r\nfirst place, his effect on the world as an expositor of the scientific\r\nmethod in its general application to life has overshadowed his exact\r\nwork; in the second place, his exact work itself has been partly lost\r\nsight of in the new discoveries and advances to which it gave rise. It\r\nis therefore necessary to reiterate that, apart from all his other\r\nsuccesses, he had made for himself an extremely distinguished position\r\nin the annals of exact science. Sir Michael Foster and Prof. Ray\r\nLankester, in their preface to the collected edition of his scientific\r\nmemoirs, make a just claim for him. These memoirs, they wrote, show\r\nthat, \"apart from the influence exerted by his popular writings, the\r\nprogress of biology during the present century was largely due to\r\nlabours of his of which the general public knew nothing, and that he\r\nwas in some respects the most original and most fertile in discovery\r\nof all his fellow workers in the same branch of science.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be little question that it was no accident that determined\r\nthe direction of Huxley's career. He was a naturalist by inborn\r\nvocation. The contrast between a natural bent and an acquired habit of\r\nlife was well seen in the case of Huxley and Macgillivray, his\r\ncompanion on the _Rattlesnake_. The former was appointed as a surgeon,\r\nand it was no part of his duties to busy himself with the creatures of\r\nthe sea; and yet his observations on them made a series of real\r\ncontributions to biological science and laid the sure foundation of a\r\nworld-wide and enduring reputation. The latter was the son of a\r\nnaturalist, a naturalist by profession, and appointed to the\r\nexpedition as its official naturalist; and yet he made only a few\r\nobservations and a limited collection of curiosities, and even his\r\nexiguous place in the annals of zoölogy is the accidental result of\r\nhis companionship with Huxley. The special natural endowments which\r\nHuxley brought to the study of zoölogy were, in the first place, a\r\nfaculty for the patient and assiduous observation of facts; in the\r\nsecond, a swift power of discriminating between the essential and the\r\naccessory among facts; in the third, the constructive ability to\r\narrange these essentials in wide generalisations which we call laws or\r\nprinciples and which, within the limits necessarily set by inductive\r\nprinciples, are the starting-point for new deductions. These were the\r\nfaculties which he brought to his science, but there were added to\r\nthem two personal characteristics without which they would not have\r\ntaken him far. They were impelled by a driving force which\r\ndistinguishes the successful man from the muddler and without which\r\nthe finest mental powers are as useless as a complicated machine\r\ndisconnected from its driving-wheel. They were directed by a lofty and\r\ndisinterested enthusiasm, without which the most talented man is a\r\nmere self-seeker, useless or dangerous to society. The faculties and\r\nqualities which made Huxley great as a zoölogist were practically\r\nthose which he applied to the general questions of biological theory,\r\nto the problems of education and of society, and to philosophy and\r\nmetaphysics. A comparison between his sane and forcible handling of\r\nquestions that lay outside the special province to which the greater\r\npart of his life was devoted, with the dubious and involved treatment\r\ngiven such questions by the professional politicians to whom the\r\nEnglish races tend to entrust their destinies, is a useful comment on\r\nthat value of science as discipline to which Huxley so strenuously\r\ncalled attention.\r\n\r\nThere can be no better way of ending this sketch of Huxley's life and\r\nwork than by quoting his own account of the objects to which he had\r\ndevoted himself consciously. These were:\r\n\r\n     \"To promote the increase of natural knowledge and to forward the\r\n     application of scientific methods of investigation to all the\r\n     problems of life to the best of my ability, in the conviction\r\n     which has grown with my growth and strengthened with my strength,\r\n     that there is no alleviation for the sufferings of mankind except\r\n     veracity of thought and of action, and the resolute facing of the\r\n     world as it is when the garment of make-believe by which pious\r\n     hands have hidden its uglier features is stripped off.\r\n\r\n      \"It is with this intent that I have subordinated any reasonable\r\n     or unreasonable ambition for scientific fame which I may have\r\n     permitted myself to entertain to other ends; to the\r\n     popularisation of science; to the development and organisation of\r\n     scientific education; to the endless series of battles and\r\n     skirmishes over evolution; and to untiring opposition to that\r\n     ecclesiastical spirit, that clericalism, which in England, as\r\n     everywhere else, and to whatever denomination it may belong, is\r\n     the deadly enemy of science.\r\n\r\n      \"In striving for the attainment of these objects, I have been\r\n     but one among many, and I shall be well content to be remembered,\r\n     or even not remembered, as such. Circumstances, among which I am\r\n     proud to reckon the devoted kindness of many friends, have led to\r\n     my occupation of various prominent positions, among which the\r\n     presidency of the Royal Society is the highest. It would be mock\r\n     modesty on my part, with these and other scientific honours which\r\n     have been bestowed upon me, to pretend that I have not succeeded\r\n     in the career which I have followed, rather because I was driven\r\n     into it than of my own free will; but I am afraid I should not\r\n     count even these things as marks of success if I could not hope\r\n     that I had not somewhat helped that movement of opinion which has\r\n     been called the New Reformation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAdams, 209\r\n\r\nAdmiralty, 14, 48,

G.P. Putnam's Sons take pleasure in announcing that they have\r\nin course of publication, in co-operation with Mr. T. Fisher Unwin, of\r\nLondon, a series of historical studies, intended to present in a\r\ngraphic manner the stories of the different nations that have attained\r\nprominence in history.\r\n\r\nIn the story form the current of each national life is distinctly\r\nindicated, and its picturesque and noteworthy periods and episodes are\r\npresented for the reader in their philosophical relation to each other\r\nas well as to universal history.\r\n\r\nIt is the plan of the writers of the different volumes to enter into\r\nthe real life of the peoples, and to bring them before the reader as\r\nthey actually lived, labored, and struggled--as they studied and\r\nwrote, and as they amused themselves. In carrying out this plan, the\r\nmyths, with which the history of all lands begins, will not be\r\noverlooked, though these will be carefully distinguished from the\r\nactual history, so far as the labors of the accepted historical\r\nauthorities have resulted in definite conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the different volumes have been planned to cover\r\nconnecting and, as far as possible, consecutive epochs or periods, so\r\nthat the set when completed will present in a comprehensive narrative\r\nthe chief events in the great STORY OF THE NATIONS; but it\r\nis, of course, not always practicable to issue the several volumes in\r\ntheir chronological order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE NATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe \"Stories\" are printed in good readable type, and in handsome 12mo\r\nform. They are adequately illustrated and furnished with maps and\r\nindexes. Price per vol., cloth, $1.50; half morocco, gilt top, $1.75.\r\n\r\nThe following are now ready:\r\n\r\nGREECE. Prof. Jas. A.
