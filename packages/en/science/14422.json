We have had many opportunities of hearing public\r\nspeakers in America cast doubts upon the very existence of God and of\r\nProvidence, question the historic nature or veracity of the whole fabric\r\nof Christianity; but never has it been our fortune to catch the\r\nslightest whisper of doubt, the slightest want of faith, in the chief\r\nGod of America--unlimited belief in the future of America.\" Mr. Reich's\r\nmethod of emphasis may not be very happy, but the substance of what he\r\nsays is true. The faith of Americans in their own country is religious,\r\nif not in its intensity, at any rate in its almost absolute and\r\nuniversal authority. It pervades the air we breathe. As children we hear\r\nit asserted or implied in the conversation of our elders. Every new\r\nstage of our educational training provides some additional testimony on\r\nits behalf. Newspapers and novelists, orators and playwrights, even if\r\nthey are little else, are at least loyal preachers of the Truth. The\r\nskeptic is not controverted; he is overlooked. It constitutes the kind\r\nof faith which is the implication, rather than the object, of thought,\r\nand consciously or unconsciously it enters largely into our personal\r\nlives as a formative influence. We may distrust and dislike much that is\r\ndone in the name of our country by our fellow-countrymen; but our\r\ncountry itself, its democratic system, and its prosperous future are\r\nabove suspicion.\r\n\r\nOf course, Americans have no monopoly of patriotic enthusiasm and good\r\nfaith. Englishmen return thanks to Providence for not being born\r\nanything but an Englishman, in churches and ale-houses as well as in\r\ncomic operas. The Frenchman cherishes and proclaims the idea that France\r\nis the most civilized modern country and satisfies best the needs of a\r\nman of high social intelligence. The Russian, whose political and social\r\nestate does not seem enviable to his foreign contemporaries, secretes a\r\nvision of a mystically glorified Russia, which condemns to comparative\r\ninsipidity the figures of the \"Pax Britannica\" and of \"La Belle France\"\r\nenlightening the world. Every nation, in proportion as its nationality\r\nis thoroughly alive, must be leavened by the ferment of some such faith.\r\nBut there are significant differences between the faith of, say, an\r\nEnglishman in the British Empire and that of an American in the Land of\r\nDemocracy. The contents of an Englishman's national idea tends to be\r\nmore exclusive. His patriotism is anchored to the historical\r\nachievements of Great Britain and restricted thereby. As a good patriot\r\nhe is bound to be more preoccupied with the inherited fabric of national\r\ninstitutions and traditions than he is with the ideal and more than\r\nnational possibilities of the future. This very loyalty to the national\r\nfabric does, indeed, imply an important ideal content; but the national\r\nidealism of an Englishman, a German, or even a Frenchman, is heavily\r\nmortgaged to his own national history and cannot honestly escape the\r\ndebt. The good patriot is obliged to offer faithful allegiance to a\r\nnetwork of somewhat arbitrary institutions, social forms, and\r\nintellectual habits--on the ground that his country is exposed to more\r\nserious dangers from premature emancipation than it is from stubborn\r\nconservatism. France is the only European country which has sought to\r\nmake headway towards a better future by means of a revolutionary break\r\nwith its past; and the results of the French experiment have served for\r\nother European countries more as a warning than as an example.\r\n\r\nThe higher American patriotism, on the other hand, combines loyalty to\r\nhistorical tradition and precedent with the imaginative projection of an\r\nideal national Promise. The Land of Democracy has always appealed to its\r\nmore enthusiastic children chiefly as a land of wonderful and more than\r\nnational possibilities. \"Neither race nor tradition,\" says Professor\r\nHugo Münsterberg in his volume on \"The Americans,\" \"nor the actual past,\r\nbinds the American to his countrymen, but rather the future which\r\ntogether they are building.\" This vision of a better future is not,\r\nperhaps, as unclouded for the present generation of Americans as it was\r\nfor certain former generations; but in spite of a more friendly\r\nacquaintance with all sorts of obstacles and pitfalls, our country is\r\nstill figured in the imagination of its citizens as the Land of Promise.\r\nThey still believe that somehow and sometime something better will\r\nhappen to good Americans than has happened to men in any other country;\r\nand this belief, vague, innocent, and uninformed though it be, is the\r\nexpression of an essential constituent in our national ideal. The past\r\nshould mean less to a European than it does to an American, and the\r\nfuture should mean more. To be sure, American life cannot with impunity\r\nbe wrenched violently from its moorings any more than the life of a\r\nEuropean country can; but our American past, compared to that of any\r\nEuropean country, has a character all its own. Its peculiarity consists,\r\nnot merely in its brevity, but in the fact that from the beginning it\r\nhas been informed by an idea. From the beginning Americans have been\r\nanticipating and projecting a better future. From the beginning the Land\r\nof Democracy has been figured as the Land of Promise. Thus the\r\nAmerican's loyalty to the national tradition rather affirms than denies\r\nthe imaginative projection of a better future. An America which was not\r\nthe Land of Promise, which was not informed by a prophetic outlook and a\r\nmore or less constructive ideal, would not be the America bequeathed to\r\nus by our forefathers. In cherishing the Promise of a better national\r\nfuture the American is fulfilling rather than imperiling the substance\r\nof the national tradition.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Americans talk of their country as the Land of Promise, a\r\nquestion may well be raised as to precisely what they mean. They mean,\r\nof course, in general, that the future will have something better in\r\nstore for them individually and collectively than has the past or the\r\npresent; but a very superficial analysis of this meaning discloses\r\ncertain ambiguities. What are the particular benefits which this better\r\nfuture will give to Americans either individually or as a nation? And\r\nhow is this Promise to be fulfilled? Will it fulfill itself, or does it\r\nimply certain responsibilities? If so, what responsibilities? When we\r\nspeak of a young man's career as promising, we mean that his abilities\r\nand opportunities are such that he is likely to become rich or famous or\r\npowerful; and this judgment does not of course imply, so far as we are\r\nconcerned, any responsibility. It is merely a prophecy based upon past\r\nperformances and proved qualities. But the career, which from the\r\nstandpoint of an outsider is merely an anticipation, becomes for the\r\nyoung man himself a serious task. For him, at all events, the better\r\nfuture will not merely happen. He will have to do something to deserve\r\nit. It may be wrecked by unforeseen obstacles, by unsuspected\r\ninfirmities, or by some critical error of judgment. So it is with the\r\nPromise of American life. From the point of view of an immigrant this\r\nPromise may consist of the anticipation of a better future, which he can\r\nshare merely by taking up his residence on American soil; but once he\r\nhas become an American, the Promise can no longer remain merely an\r\nanticipation. It becomes in that case a responsibility, which requires\r\nfor its fulfillment a certain kind of behavior on the part of himself\r\nand his fellow-Americans. And when we attempt to define the Promise of\r\nAmerican life, we are obliged, also, to describe the kind of behavior\r\nwhich the fulfillment of the Promise demands.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the two aspects of America as a Land of Promise\r\nmade in the preceding paragraph is sufficiently obvious, but it is\r\nusually slurred by the average good American patriot. The better future,\r\nwhich is promised for himself, his children, and for other Americans, is\r\nchiefly a matter of confident anticipation. He looks upon it very much\r\nas a friendly outsider might look on some promising individual career.\r\nThe better future is understood by him as something which fulfills\r\nitself. He calls his country, not only the Land of Promise, but the Land\r\nof Destiny. It is fairly launched on a brilliant and successful career,\r\nthe continued prosperity of which is prophesied by the very momentum of\r\nits advance. As Mr. H.G. Wells says in \"The Future in America,\" \"When\r\none talks to an American of his national purpose, he seems a little at a\r\nloss; if one speaks of his national destiny, he responds with alacrity.\"\r\nThe great majority of Americans would expect a book written about \"The\r\nPromise of American Life\" to contain chiefly a fanciful description of\r\nthe glorious American future--a sort of Utopia up-to-date, situated in\r\nthe land of Good-Enough, and flying the Stars and Stripes. They might\r\nadmit in words that the achievement of this glorious future implied\r\ncertain responsibilities, but they would not regard the admission either\r\nas startling or novel. Such responsibilities were met by our\r\npredecessors; they will be met by our followers. Inasmuch as it is the\r\nhonorable American past which prophesies on behalf of the better\r\nAmerican future, our national responsibility consists fundamentally in\r\nremaining true to traditional ways of behavior, standards, and ideals.\r\nWhat we Americans have to do in order to fulfill our national Promise is\r\nto keep up the good work--to continue resolutely and cheerfully along\r\nthe appointed path.\r\n\r\nThe reader who expects this book to contain a collection of patriotic\r\nprophecies will be disappointed. I am not a prophet in any sense of the\r\nword, and I entertain an active and intense dislike of the foregoing\r\nmixture of optimism, fatalism, and conservatism. To conceive the better\r\nAmerican future as a consummation which will take care of itself,--as\r\nthe necessary result of our customary conditions, institutions, and\r\nideas,--persistence in such a conception is admirably designed to\r\ndeprive American life of any promise at all. The better future which\r\nAmericans propose to build is nothing if not an idea which must in\r\ncertain essential respects emancipate them from their past. American\r\nhistory contains much matter for pride and congratulation, and much\r\nmatter for regret and humiliation. On the whole, it is a past of which\r\nthe loyal American has no reason to feel ashamed, chiefly because it has\r\nthroughout been made better than it was by the vision of a better\r\nfuture; and the American of to-day and to-morrow must remain true to\r\nthat traditional vision. He must be prepared to sacrifice to that\r\ntraditional vision even the traditional American ways of realizing it.\r\nSuch a sacrifice is, I believe, coming to be demanded; and unless it is\r\nmade, American life will gradually cease to have any specific Promise.\r\n\r\nThe only fruitful promise of which the life of any individual or any\r\nnation can be possessed, is a promise determined by an ideal. Such a\r\npromise is to be fulfilled, not by sanguine anticipations, not by a\r\nconservative imitation of past achievements, but by laborious,\r\nsingle-minded, clear-sighted, and fearless work. If the promising career\r\nof any individual is not determined by a specific and worthy purpose, it\r\nrapidly drifts into a mere pursuit of success; and even if such a\r\npursuit is successful, whatever promise it may have had, is buried in\r\nthe grave of its triumph. So it is with a nation. If its promise is\r\nanything more than a vision of power and success, that addition must\r\nderive its value from a purpose; because in the moral world the future\r\nexists only as a workshop in which a purpose is to be realized. Each of\r\nthe several leading European nations is possessed of a specific purpose\r\ndetermined for the most part by the pressure of historical\r\ncircumstances; but the American nation is committed to a purpose which\r\nis not merely of historical manufacture. It is committed to the\r\nrealization of the democratic ideal; and if its Promise is to be\r\nfulfilled, it must be prepared to follow whithersoever that ideal may\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Americans have in some measure always conceived their national\r\nfuture as an ideal to be fulfilled. Their anticipations have been\r\nuplifting as well as confident and vainglorious. They have been\r\nprophesying not merely a safe and triumphant, but also a better, future.\r\nThe ideal demand for some sort of individual and social amelioration has\r\nalways accompanied even their vainest flights of patriotic prophecy.\r\nThey may never have sufficiently realized that this better future, just\r\nin so far as it is better, will have to be planned and constructed\r\nrather than fulfilled of its own momentum; but at any rate, in seeking\r\nto disentangle and emphasize the ideal implications of the American\r\nnational Promise, I am not wholly false to the accepted American\r\ntradition. Even if Americans have neglected these ideal implications,\r\neven if they have conceived the better future as containing chiefly a\r\nlarger portion of familiar benefits, the ideal demand, nevertheless, has\r\nalways been palpably present; and if it can be established as the\r\ndominant aspect of the American tradition, that tradition may be\r\ntransformed, but it will not be violated.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, much as we may dislike the American disposition to take the\r\nfulfillment of our national Promise for granted, the fact that such a\r\ndisposition exists in its present volume and vigor demands respectful\r\nconsideration. It has its roots in the salient conditions of American\r\nlife, and in the actual experience of the American people. The national\r\nPromise, as it is popularly understood, has in a way been fulfilling\r\nitself. If the underlying conditions were to remain much as they have\r\nbeen, the prevalent mixture of optimism, fatalism, and conservatism\r\nmight retain a formidable measure of justification; and the changes\r\nwhich are taking place in the underlying conditions and in the scope of\r\nAmerican national experience afford the most reasonable expectation that\r\nthis state of mind will undergo a radical alteration. It is new\r\nconditions which are forcing Americans to choose between the conception\r\nof their national Promise as a process and an ideal. Before, however,\r\nthe nature of these novel conditions and their significance can be\r\nconsidered, we must examine with more care the relation between the\r\nearlier American economic and social conditions and the ideas and\r\ninstitutions associated with them. Only by a better understanding of the\r\npopular tradition, only by an analysis of its merits and its\r\ndifficulties, can we reach a more consistent and edifying conception of\r\nthe Promise of American life.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHOW THE PROMISE HAS BEEN REALIZED\r\n\r\nAll the conditions of American life have tended to encourage an easy,\r\ngenerous, and irresponsible optimism. As compared to Europeans,\r\nAmericans have been very much favored by circumstances. Had it not been\r\nfor the Atlantic Ocean and the virgin wilderness, the United States\r\nwould never have been the Land of Promise. The European Powers have been\r\nobliged from the very conditions of their existence to be more\r\ncircumspect and less confident of the future. They are always by way of\r\nfighting for their national security and integrity. With possible or\r\nactual enemies on their several frontiers, and with their land fully\r\noccupied by their own population, they need above all to be strong, to\r\nbe cautious, to be united, and to be opportune in their policy and\r\nbehavior. The case of France shows the danger of neglecting the sources\r\nof internal strength, while at the same time philandering with ideas\r\nand projects of human amelioration. Bismarck and Cavour seized the\r\nopportunity of making extremely useful for Germany and Italy the\r\nirrelevant and vacillating idealism and the timid absolutism of the\r\nthird Napoleon. Great Britain has occupied in this respect a better\r\nsituation than has the Continental Powers. Her insular security made her\r\nmore independent of the menaces and complications of foreign politics,\r\nand left her free to be measurably liberal at home and immeasurably\r\nimperial abroad. Yet she has made only a circumspect use of her freedom.\r\nBritish liberalism was forged almost exclusively for the British people,\r\nand the British peace for colonial subjects. Great Britain could have\r\nafforded better than France to tie its national life to an over-national\r\nidea, but the only idea in which Britons have really believed was that\r\nof British security, prosperity, and power. In the case of our own\r\ncountry the advantages possessed by England have been amplified and\r\nextended. The United States was divided from the mainland of Europe not\r\nby a channel but by an ocean. Its dimensions were continental rather\r\nthan insular. We were for the most part freed from alien interference,\r\nand could, so far as we dared, experiment with political and social\r\nideals. The land was unoccupied, and its settlement offered an\r\nunprecedented area and abundance of economic opportunity. After the\r\nRevolution the whole political and social organization was renewed, and\r\nmade both more serviceable and more flexible. Under such happy\r\ncircumstances the New World was assuredly destined to become to its\r\ninhabitants a Land of Promise,--a land in which men were offered a\r\nfairer chance and a better future than the best which the Old World\r\ncould afford.\r\n\r\nNo more explicit expression has ever been given to the way in which the\r\nLand of Promise was first conceived by its children than in the \"Letters\r\nof an American Farmer.\" This book was written by a French immigrant,\r\nHector St. John de Crèvecoeur before the Revolution, and is informed by\r\nan intense consciousness of the difference between conditions in the Old\r\nand in the New World. \"What, then, is an American, this new man?\" asks\r\nthe Pennsylvanian farmer. \"He is either a European or the descendant of\r\na European; hence the strange mixture of blood, which you will find in\r\nno other country....\r\n\r\n\"He becomes an American by being received in the broad lap of our great\r\n_Alma Mater_. Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race\r\nof men, whose labors and prosperity will one day cause great changes in\r\nthe world. Here the rewards of his industry follow with equal steps the\r\nprogress of his labor; this labor is founded on the basis of\r\n_self-interest_; can it want a stronger allurement? Wives and children,\r\nwho before in vain demanded a morsel of bread, now fat and frolicsome,\r\ngladly help their father to clear those fields, whence exuberant crops\r\nare to arise to feed them all; without any part being claimed either by\r\na despotic prince, a rich abbot, or a mighty lord.... The American is a\r\nnew man, who acts upon new principles; he must therefore entertain new\r\nideas and form new opinions. From involuntary idleness, servile\r\ndependence, penury, and useless labor, he has passed to toils of a very\r\ndifferent nature rewarded by ample subsistence. This is an American.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the foregoing is one of the first, it is also one of the most\r\nexplicit descriptions of the fundamental American; and it deserves to be\r\nanalyzed with some care. According to this French convert the American\r\nis a man, or the descendant of a man, who has emigrated from Europe\r\nchiefly because he expects to be better able in the New World to enjoy\r\nthe fruits of his own labor. The conception implies, consequently, an\r\nOld World, in which the ordinary man cannot become independent and\r\nprosperous, and, on the other hand, a New World in which economic\r\nopportunities are much more abundant and accessible. America has been\r\npeopled by Europeans primarily because they expected in that country to\r\nmake more money more easily. To the European immigrant--that is, to the\r\naliens who have been converted into Americans by the advantages of\r\nAmerican life--the Promise of America has consisted largely in the\r\nopportunity which it offered of economic independence and prosperity.\r\nWhatever else the better future, of which Europeans anticipate the\r\nenjoyment in America, may contain, these converts will consider\r\nthemselves cheated unless they are in a measure relieved of the curse of\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nThis conception of American life and its Promise is as much alive to-day\r\nas it was in 1780. Its expression has no doubt been modified during\r\nfour generations of democratic political independence, but the\r\nmodification has consisted of an expansion and a development rather than\r\nof a transposition. The native American, like the alien immigrant,\r\nconceives the better future which awaits himself and other men in\r\nAmerica as fundamentally a future in which economic prosperity will be\r\nstill more abundant and still more accessible than it has yet been\r\neither here or abroad. No alteration or attenuation of this demand has\r\nbeen permitted. With all their professions of Christianity their\r\nnational idea remains thoroughly worldly. They do not want either for\r\nthemselves or for their descendants an indefinite future of poverty and\r\ndeprivation in this world, redeemed by beatitude in the next. The\r\nPromise, which bulks so large in their patriotic outlook, is a promise\r\nof comfort and prosperity for an ever increasing majority of good\r\nAmericans. At a later stage of their social development they may come to\r\nbelieve that they have ordered a larger supply of prosperity than the\r\neconomic factory is capable of producing. Those who are already rich and\r\ncomfortable, and who are keenly alive to the difficulty of distributing\r\nthese benefits over a larger social area, may come to tolerate the idea\r\nthat poverty and want are an essential part of the social order. But as\r\nyet this traditional European opinion has found few echoes in America,\r\neven among the comfortable and the rich. The general belief still is\r\nthat Americans are not destined to renounce, but to enjoy.\r\n\r\nLet it be immediately added, however, that this economic independence\r\nand prosperity has always been absolutely associated in the American\r\nmind with free political institutions. The \"American Farmer\" traced the\r\ngood fortune of the European immigrant in America, not merely to the\r\nabundance of economic opportunity, but to the fact that a ruling class\r\nof abbots and lords had no prior claim to a large share of the products\r\nof the soil. He did not attach the name of democracy to the improved\r\npolitical and social institutions of America, and when the political\r\ndifferences between Great Britain and her American colonies culminated\r\nin the Revolutionary War, the converted \"American Farmer\" was filled\r\nwith anguish at this violent assertion of the \"New Americanism.\"\r\nNevertheless he was fully alive to the benefits which the immigrant\r\nenjoyed from a larger dose of political and social freedom; and so, of\r\ncourse, have been all the more intelligent of the European converts to\r\nAmericanism. A certain number of them, particularly during the early\r\nyears, came over less for the purpose of making money than for that of\r\nescaping from European political and religious persecution. America has\r\nalways been conventionally conceived, not merely as a land of abundant\r\nand accessible economic opportunities, but also as a refuge for the\r\noppressed; and the immigrant ships are crowded both during times of\r\nEuropean famine and during times of political revolution and\r\npersecution.\r\n\r\nInevitably, however, this aspect of the American Promise has undergone\r\ncertain important changes since the establishment of our national\r\nindependence. When the colonists succeeded in emancipating themselves\r\nfrom political allegiance to Great Britain, they were confronted by the\r\ntask of organizing a stable and efficient government without encroaching\r\non the freedom, which was even at that time traditionally associated\r\nwith American life. The task was by no means an easy one, and required\r\nfor its performance the application of other political principles than\r\nthat of freedom. The men who were responsible for this great work were\r\nnot, perhaps, entirely candid in recognizing the profound modifications\r\nin their traditional ideas which their constructive political work had\r\nimplied; but they were at all events fully aware of the great importance\r\nof their addition to the American idea. That idea, while not ceasing to\r\nbe at bottom economic, became more than ever political and social in its\r\nmeaning and contents. The Land of Freedom became in the course of time\r\nalso the Land of Equality. The special American political system, the\r\nconstruction of which was predicted in the \"Farmer's\" assertion of the\r\nnecessary novelty of American modes of thought and action, was made\r\nexplicitly, if not uncompromisingly, democratic; and the success of this\r\ndemocratic political system was indissolubly associated in the American\r\nmind with the persistence of abundant and widely distributed economic\r\nprosperity. Our democratic institutions became in a sense the guarantee\r\nthat prosperity would continue to be abundant and accessible. In case\r\nthe majority of good Americans were not prosperous, there would be grave\r\nreasons for suspecting that our institutions were not doing their duty.\r\n\r\nThe more consciously democratic Americans became, however, the less they\r\nwere satisfied with a conception of the Promised Land, which went no\r\nfarther than a pervasive economic prosperity guaranteed by free\r\ninstitutions. The amelioration promised to aliens and to future\r\nAmericans was to possess its moral and social aspects. The implication\r\nwas, and still is, that by virtue of the more comfortable and less\r\ntrammeled lives which Americans were enabled to lead, they would\r\nconstitute a better society and would become in general a worthier set\r\nof men. The confidence which American institutions placed in the\r\nAmerican citizen was considered equivalent to a greater faith in the\r\nexcellence of human nature. In our favored land political liberty and\r\neconomic opportunity were by a process of natural education inevitably\r\nmaking for individual and social amelioration. In Europe the people did\r\nnot have a fair chance. Population increased more quickly than economic\r\nopportunities, and the opportunities which did exist were largely\r\nmonopolized by privileged classes. Power was lodged in the hands of a\r\nfew men, whose interest depended upon keeping the people in a condition\r\nof economic and political servitude; and in this way a divorce was\r\ncreated between individual interest and social stability and welfare.\r\nThe interests of the privileged rulers demanded the perpetuation of\r\nunjust institutions. The interest of the people demanded a revolutionary\r\nupheaval. In the absence of such a revolution they had no sufficient\r\ninducement to seek their own material and moral improvement. The theory\r\nwas proclaimed and accepted as a justification for this system of\r\npopular oppression that men were not to be trusted to take care of\r\nthemselves--that they could be kept socially useful only by the severest\r\nmeasures of moral, religious, and political discipline. The theory of\r\nthe American democracy and its practice was proclaimed to be the\r\nantithesis of this European theory and practice. The people were to be\r\ntrusted rather than suspected and disciplined. They must be tied to\r\ntheir country by the strong bond of self-interest. Give them a fair\r\nchance, and the natural goodness of human nature would do the rest.\r\nIndividual and public interest will, on the whole, coincide, provided no\r\nindividuals are allowed to have special privileges. Thus the American\r\nsystem will be predestined to success by its own adequacy, and its\r\nsuccess will constitute an enormous stride towards human amelioration.\r\nJust because our system is at bottom a thorough test of the ability of\r\nhuman nature to respond admirably to a fair chance, the issue of the\r\nexperiment is bound to be of more than national importance. The American\r\nsystem stands for the highest hope of an excellent worldly life that\r\nmankind has yet ventured,--the hope that men can be improved without\r\nbeing fettered, that they can be saved without even vicariously being\r\nnailed to the cross.\r\n\r\nSuch are the claims advanced on behalf of the American system; and\r\nwithin certain limits this system has made good. Americans have been\r\nmore than usually prosperous. They have been more than usually free.\r\nThey have, on the whole, made their freedom and prosperity contribute to\r\na higher level of individual and social excellence. Most assuredly the\r\naverage Americanized American is neither a more intelligent, a wiser,\r\nnor a better man than the average European; but he is likely to be a\r\nmore energetic and hopeful one. Out of a million well-established\r\nAmericans, taken indiscriminately from all occupations and conditions,\r\ncompared to a corresponding assortment of Europeans, a larger proportion\r\nof the former will be leading alert, active, and useful lives. Within a\r\ngiven social area there will be a smaller amount of social wreckage and\r\na larger amount of wholesome and profitable achievement. The mass of the\r\nAmerican people is, on the whole, more deeply stirred, more thoroughly\r\nawake, more assertive in their personal demands, and more confident of\r\nsatisfying them. In a word, they are more alive, and they must be\r\ncredited with the moral and social benefit attaching to a larger amount\r\nof vitality.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this greater individual vitality, although intimately\r\nconnected with the superior agricultural and industrial opportunities of\r\na new country, has not been due exclusively to such advantages.\r\nUndoubtedly the vast areas of cheap and fertile land which have been\r\ncontinuously available for settlement have contributed, not only to the\r\nabundance of American prosperity, but also to the formation of American\r\ncharacter and institutions; and undoubtedly many of the economic and\r\npolitical evils which are now becoming offensively obtrusive are\r\ndirectly or indirectly derived from the gradual monopolization of\r\ncertain important economic opportunities. Nevertheless, these\r\nopportunities could never have been converted so quickly into\r\nsubstantial benefits had it not been for our more democratic political\r\nand social forms. A privileged class does not secure itself in the\r\nenjoyment of its advantages merely by legal intrenchments. It depends\r\nquite as much upon disqualifying the \"lower classes\" from utilizing\r\ntheir opportunities by a species of social inhibition. The rail-splitter\r\ncan be so easily encouraged to believe that rail-splitting is his\r\nvocation. The tragedy in the life of Mr. J.M. Barrie's \"Admirable\r\nCrichton\" was not due to any legal prohibition of his conversion in\r\nEngland, as on the tropic island, into a veritable chief, but that on\r\nEnglish soil he did not in his own soul want any such elevation and\r\ndistinction. His very loyalty to the forms and fabric of English life\r\nkept him fatuously content with the mean truckling and meaner\r\ndomineering of his position of butler. On the other hand, the loyalty of\r\nan American to the American idea would tend to make him aggressive and\r\nself-confident. Our democratic prohibition of any but occasional social\r\ndistinctions and our democratic dislike to any suggestion of authentic\r\nsocial inferiority have contributed as essentially to the fluid and\r\nelastic substance of American life as have its abundant and accessible\r\neconomic opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe increased momentum of American life, both in its particles and its\r\nmass, unquestionably has a considerable moral and social value. It is\r\nthe beginning, the only possible beginning, of a better life for the\r\npeople as individuals and for society. So long as the great majority of\r\nthe poor in any country are inert and are laboring without any hope of\r\nsubstantial rewards in this world, the whole associated life of that\r\ncommunity rests on an equivocal foundation. Its moral and social order\r\nis tied to an economic system which starves and mutilates the great\r\nmajority of the population, and under such conditions its religion\r\nnecessarily becomes a spiritual drug, administered for the purpose of\r\nsubduing the popular discontent and relieving the popular misery. The\r\nonly way the associated life of such a community can be radically\r\nimproved is by the leavening of the inert popular mass. Their wants must\r\nbe satisfied, and must be sharpened and increased with the habit of\r\nsatisfaction. During the past hundred years every European state has\r\nmade a great stride in the direction of arousing its poorer citizens to\r\nbe more wholesomely active, discontented, and expectant; but our own\r\ncountry has succeeded in traveling farther in this direction than has\r\nany other, and it may well be proud of its achievement. That the\r\nAmerican political and economic system has accomplished so much on\r\nbehalf of the ordinary man does constitute the fairest hope that men\r\nhave been justified in entertaining of a better worldly order; and any\r\nhigher social achievement, which America may hereafter reach, must\r\ndepend upon an improved perpetuation of this process. The mass of\r\nmankind must be aroused to still greater activity by a still more\r\nabundant satisfaction of their needs, and by a consequent increase of\r\ntheir aggressive discontent.\r\n\r\nThe most discriminating appreciation, which I have ever read, of the\r\nsocial value of American national achievement has been written by Mr.\r\nJohn B. Crozier; and the importance of the matter is such that it will\r\nbe well to quote it at length. Says Mr. Crozier in his chapter on\r\n\"Reconstruction in America,\" in the third volume of his \"History of\r\nIntellectual Development\": \"There [in America] a natural equality of\r\nsentiment, springing out of and resting on a broad equality of material\r\nand social conditions, has been the heritage of the people from the\r\nearliest times.... This broad natural equality of sentiment, rooted in\r\nequal material opportunities, equal education, equal laws, equal\r\nopportunities, and equal access to all positions of honor and trust, has\r\njust sufficient inequality mixed with it--in the shape of greater or\r\nless mental endowments, higher or lower degrees of culture, larger or\r\nsmaller material possessions, and so on--to keep it sweet and human;\r\nwhile at the same time it is all so gently graded, and marked by\r\ntransitions so easy and natural, that no gap was anywhere to be\r\ndiscovered on which to found an order of privilege or caste. Now an\r\nequality like this, with the erectness, independence, energy, and\r\ninitiative it brings with it, in men, sprung from the loins of an\r\nimperial race is a possession, not for a nation only, but for\r\ncivilization itself and for humanity. It is the distinct raising of the\r\nentire body of a people to a higher level, and so brings civilization a\r\nstage nearer its goal. It is the first successful attempt in recorded\r\nhistory to get a healthy, natural equality which should reach down to\r\nthe foundations of the state and to the great masses of men; and in its\r\nresults corresponds to what in other lands (excepting, perhaps, in\r\nluxury alone) has been attained only by the few,--the successful and the\r\nruling spirits. To lose it, therefore, to barter it or give it away,\r\nwould be in the language of Othello 'such deep damnation that nothing\r\nelse could match,' and would be an irreparable loss to the world and to\r\ncivilization.\"\r\n\r\nSurely no nation can ask for a higher and more generous tribute than\r\nthat which Mr. Crozier renders to America in the foregoing quotation,\r\nand its value is increased by the source from which it comes. It is\r\nwritten by a man who, as a Canadian, has had the opportunity of knowing\r\nAmerican life well without being biased in its favor, and who, as the\r\nhistorian of the intellectual development of our race, has made an\r\nexhaustive study of the civilizations both of the ancient and the modern\r\nworlds. Nothing can be soberly added to it on behalf of American\r\nnational achievement, but neither should it be diminished by any\r\nimportant idea and phrase. The American economic, political, and social\r\norganization has given to its citizens the benefits of material\r\nprosperity, political liberty, and a wholesome natural equality; and\r\nthis achievement is a gain, not only to Americans, but to the world and\r\nto civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHOW THE PROMISE IS TO BE REALIZED\r\n\r\nIn the preceding section I have been seeking to render justice to the\r\nactual achievements of the American nation. A work of manifest\r\nindividual and social value has been wrought; and this work, not only\r\nexplains the expectant popular outlook towards the future, but it\r\npartially determines the character as distinguished from the continued\r\nfulfillment of the American national Promise. The better future,\r\nwhatever else it may bring, must bring at any rate a continuation of the\r\ngood things of the past. The drama of its fulfillment must find an\r\nappropriate setting in the familiar American social and economic\r\nscenery. No matter how remote the end may be, no matter what unfamiliar\r\nsacrifices may eventually be required on its behalf, the substance of\r\nthe existing achievement must constitute a veritable beginning, because\r\non no other condition can the attribution of a peculiar Promise to\r\nAmerican life find a specific warrant. On no other condition would our\r\nnational Promise constitute more than an admirable but irrelevant moral\r\nand social aspiration.\r\n\r\nThe moral and social aspiration proper to American life is, of course,\r\nthe aspiration vaguely described by the word democratic; and the actual\r\nachievement of the American nation points towards an adequate and\r\nfruitful definition of the democratic ideal. Americans are usually\r\nsatisfied by a most inadequate verbal description of democracy, but\r\ntheir national achievement implies one which is much more comprehensive\r\nand formative. In order to be true to their past, the increasing comfort\r\nand economic independence of an ever increasing proportion of the\r\npopulation must be secured, and it must be secured by a combination of\r\nindividual effort and proper political organization. Above all, however,\r\nthis economic and political system must be made to secure results of\r\nmoral and social value. It is the seeking of such results which converts\r\ndemocracy from a political system into a constructive social ideal; and\r\nthe more the ideal significance of the American national Promise is\r\nasserted and emphasized, the greater will become the importance of\r\nsecuring these moral and social benefits.\r\n\r\nThe fault in the vision of our national future possessed by the ordinary\r\nAmerican does not consist in the expectation of some continuity of\r\nachievement. It consists rather in the expectation that the familiar\r\nbenefits will continue to accumulate automatically. In his mind the\r\nideal Promise is identified with the processes and conditions which\r\nhitherto have very much simplified its fulfillment, and he fails\r\nsufficiently to realize that the conditions and processes are one thing\r\nand the ideal Promise quite another. Moreover, these underlying social\r\nand economic conditions are themselves changing, in such wise that\r\nhereafter the ideal Promise, instead of being automatically fulfilled,\r\nmay well be automatically stifled. For two generations and more the\r\nAmerican people were, from the economic point of view, most happily\r\nsituated. They were able, in a sense, to slide down hill into the valley\r\nof fulfillment. Economic conditions were such that, given a fair start,\r\nthey could scarcely avoid reaching a desirable goal. But such is no\r\nlonger the case. Economic conditions have been profoundly modified, and\r\nAmerican political and social problems have been modified with them. The\r\nPromise of American life must depend less than it did upon the virgin\r\nwilderness and the Atlantic Ocean, for the virgin wilderness has\r\ndisappeared, and the Atlantic Ocean has become merely a big channel. The\r\nsame results can no longer be achieved by the same easy methods. Ugly\r\nobstacles have jumped into view, and ugly obstacles are peculiarly\r\ndangerous to a person who is sliding down hill. The man who is\r\nclambering up hill is in a much better position to evade or overcome\r\nthem. Americans will possess a safer as well as a worthier vision of\r\ntheir national Promise as soon as they give it a house on a hill-top\r\nrather than in a valley.\r\n\r\nThe very genuine experience upon which American optimistic fatalism\r\nrests, is equivalent, because of its limitations, to a dangerous\r\ninexperience, and of late years an increasing number of Americans have\r\nbeen drawing this inference. They have been coming to see themselves\r\nmore as others see them; and as an introduction to a consideration of\r\nthis more critical frame of mind, I am going to quote another\r\nforeigner's view of American life,--the foreigner in this case being an\r\nEnglishman and writing in 1893.\r\n\r\n\"The American note,\" says Mr. James Muirhead in his \"Land of Contrasts,\"\r\n\"includes a sense of illimitable expansion and possibility, an almost\r\nchildlike confidence in human ability and fearlessness of both the\r\npresent and the future, a wider realization of human brotherhood than\r\nhas yet existed, a greater theoretical willingness to judge by the\r\nindividual than by the class, a breezy indifference to authority and a\r\npositive predilection for innovation, a marked alertness of mind, and a\r\nmanifold variety of interest--above all, an inextinguishable hopefulness\r\nand courage. It is easy to lay one's finger in America upon almost every\r\none of the great defects of civilization--even those defects which are\r\nspecially characteristic of the civilization of the Old World. The\r\nUnited States cannot claim to be exempt from manifestations of economic\r\nslavery, of grinding the faces of the poor, of exploitation of the weak,\r\nof unfair distribution of wealth, of unjust monopoly, of unequal laws,\r\nof industrial and commercial chicanery, of disgraceful ignorance, of\r\neconomic fallacies, of public corruption, of interested legislation, of\r\nwant of public spirit, of vulgar boasting and chauvinism, of snobbery,\r\nof class prejudice, of respect of persons, and of a preference of the\r\nmaterial over the spiritual. In a word, America has not attained, or\r\nnearly attained, perfection. But below and behind, and beyond all its\r\nweakness and evils, there is the grand fact of a noble national theory\r\nfounded on reason and conscience.\" The reader will remark in the\r\nforegoing quotation that Mr. Muirhead is equally emphatic in his\r\napproval and in his disapproval. He generously recognizes almost as much\r\nthat is good about Americans and their ways as our most vivacious\r\npatriotic orators would claim, while at the same time he has marshaled\r\nan army of abuses and sins which sound like an echo of the pages of the\r\n_London Saturday Review_. In the end he applies a friendly dash of\r\nwhitewash by congratulating us on the \"grand fact of our noble national\r\ntheory,\" but to a discerning mind the consolation is not very consoling.\r\nThe trouble is that the sins with which America is charged by Mr.\r\nMuirhead are flagrant violations of our noble national theory. So far as\r\nhis charges are true, they are a denial that the American political and\r\neconomic organization is accomplishing the results which its traditional\r\nclaims require. If, as Mr. Muirhead charges, Americans permit the\r\nexistence of economic slavery, if they grind the face of the poor, if\r\nthey exploit the weak and distribute wealth unjustly, if they allow\r\nmonopolies to prevail and laws to be unequal, if they are disgracefully\r\nignorant, politically corrupt, commercially unscrupulous, socially\r\nsnobbish, vulgarly boastful, and morally coarse,--if the substance of\r\nthe foregoing indictment is really true, why, the less that is said\r\nabout a noble national theory, the better. A man who is a sturdy sinner\r\nall the week hardly improves his moral standing by attending church on\r\nSunday and professing a noble Christian theory of life. There must\r\nsurely be some better way of excusing our sins than by raising aloft a\r\nnoble theory of which these sins are a glaring violation.\r\n\r\nI have quoted from Mr. Muirhead, not because his antithetic\r\ncharacterization of American life is very illuminating, but because of\r\nthe precise terms of his charges against America. His indictment is\r\npractically equivalent to the assertion that the American system is not,\r\nor at least is no longer, achieving as much as has been claimed on its\r\nbehalf. A democratic system may permit undefiled the existence of many\r\nsins and abuses, but it cannot permit the exploitation of the ordinary\r\nman by means of unjust laws and institutions. Neither can this\r\nindictment be dismissed without argument. When Mr. Muirhead's book was\r\nwritten sixteen years ago, the majority of good Americans would\r\nassuredly have read the charge with an incredulous smile; but in the\r\nyear 1909 they might behave differently. The sins of which Mr. Muirhead\r\naccused Americans sixteen years ago are substantially the sins of which\r\nto-day they are accusing themselves--or rather one another. A numerous\r\nand powerful group of reformers has been collecting whose whole\r\npolitical policy and action is based on the conviction that the \"common\r\npeople\" have not been getting the Square Deal to which they are entitled\r\nunder the American system; and these reformers are carrying with them a\r\nconstantly increasing body of public opinion. A considerable proportion\r\nof the American people is beginning to exhibit economic and political,\r\nas well as personal, discontent. A generation ago the implication was\r\nthat if a man remained poor and needy, his poverty was his own fault,\r\nbecause the American system was giving all its citizens a fair chance.\r\nNow, however, the discontented poor are beginning to charge their\r\npoverty to an unjust political and economic organization, and reforming\r\nagitators do not hesitate to support them in this contention. Manifestly\r\na threatened obstacle has been raised against the anticipated\r\nrealization of our national Promise. Unless the great majority of\r\nAmericans not only have, but believe they have, a fair chance, the\r\nbetter American future will be dangerously compromised.\r\n\r\nThe conscious recognition of grave national abuses casts a deep shadow\r\nacross the traditional American patriotic vision. The sincere and candid\r\nreformer can no longer consider the national Promise as destined to\r\nautomatic fulfillment. The reformers themselves are, no doubt, far from\r\nbelieving that whatever peril there is cannot be successfully averted.\r\nThey make a point of being as patriotically prophetic as the most\r\n\"old-fashioned Democrat.\" They proclaim even more loudly their\r\nconviction of an indubitable and a beneficent national future. But they\r\ndo not and cannot believe that this future will take care of itself. As\r\nreformers they are bound to assert that the national body requires for\r\nthe time being a good deal of medical attendance, and many of them\r\nanticipate that even after the doctors have discontinued their daily\r\nvisits the patient will still need the supervision of a sanitary\r\nspecialist. He must be persuaded to behave so that he will not easily\r\nfall ill again, and so that his health will be permanently improved.\r\nConsequently, just in so far as reformers are reformers they are obliged\r\nto abandon the traditional American patriotic fatalism. The national\r\nPromise has been transformed into a closer equivalent of a national\r\npurpose, the fulfillment of which is a matter of conscious work.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the old sense of a glorious national destiny into\r\nthe sense of a serious national purpose will inevitably tend to make the\r\npopular realization of the Promise of American life both more explicit\r\nand more serious. As long as Americans believed they were able to\r\nfulfill a noble national Promise merely by virtue of maintaining intact\r\na set of political institutions and by the vigorous individual pursuit\r\nof private ends, their allegiance to their national fulfillment remained\r\nmore a matter of words than of deeds; but now that they are being\r\naroused from their patriotic slumber, the effect is inevitably to\r\ndisentangle the national idea and to give it more dignity. The\r\nredemption of the national Promise has become a cause for which the good\r\nAmerican must fight, and the cause for which a man fights is a cause\r\nwhich he more than ever values. The American idea is no longer to be\r\npropagated merely by multiplying the children of the West and by\r\ngranting ignorant aliens permission to vote. Like all sacred causes, it\r\nmust be propagated by the Word and by that right arm of the Word, which\r\nis the Sword.\r\n\r\nThe more enlightened reformers are conscious of the additional dignity\r\nand value which the popularity of reform has bestowed upon the American\r\nidea, but they still fail to realize the deeper implications of their\r\nown programme. In abandoning the older conception of an automatic\r\nfulfillment of our national destiny, they have abandoned more of the\r\ntraditional American point of view than they are aware. The traditional\r\nAmerican optimistic fatalism was not of accidental origin, and it cannot\r\nbe abandoned without involving in its fall some other important\r\ningredients in the accepted American tradition. Not only was it\r\ndependent on economic conditions which prevailed until comparatively\r\nrecent times, but it has been associated with certain erroneous but\r\nhighly cherished political theories. It has been wrought into the fabric\r\nof our popular economic and political ideas to such an extent that its\r\noverthrow necessitates a partial revision of some of the most important\r\narticles in the traditional American creed.\r\n\r\nThe extent and the character of this revision may be inferred from a\r\nbrief consideration of the effect upon the substance of our national\r\nPromise of an alteration in its proposed method of fulfillment. The\r\nsubstance of our national Promise has consisted, as we have seen, of an\r\nimproving popular economic condition, guaranteed by democratic political\r\ninstitutions, and resulting in moral and social amelioration. These\r\nmanifold benefits were to be obtained merely by liberating the\r\nenlightened self-interest of the American people. The beneficent result\r\nfollowed inevitably from the action of wholly selfish motives--provided,\r\nof course, the democratic political system of equal rights was\r\nmaintained in its integrity. The fulfillment of the American Promise was\r\nconsidered inevitable because it was based upon a combination of\r\nself-interest and the natural goodness of human nature. On the other\r\nhand, if the fulfillment of our national Promise can no longer be\r\nconsidered inevitable, if it must be considered as equivalent to a\r\nconscious national purpose instead of an inexorable national destiny,\r\nthe implication necessarily is that the trust reposed in individual\r\nself-interest has been in some measure betrayed. No preëstablished\r\nharmony can then exist between the free and abundant satisfaction of\r\nprivate needs and the accomplishment of a morally and socially desirable\r\nresult. The Promise of American life is to be fulfilled--not merely by a\r\nmaximum amount of economic freedom, but by a certain measure of\r\ndiscipline; not merely by the abundant satisfaction of individual\r\ndesires, but by a large measure of individual subordination and\r\nself-denial. And this necessity of subordinating the satisfaction of\r\nindividual desires to the fulfillment of a national purpose is attached\r\nparticularly to the absorbing occupation of the American people,--the\r\noccupation, viz.: of accumulating wealth. The automatic fulfillment of\r\nthe American national Promise is to be abandoned, if at all, precisely\r\nbecause the traditional American confidence in individual freedom has\r\nresulted in a morally and socially undesirable distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nIn making the concluding statement of the last paragraph I am venturing,\r\nof course, upon very debatable ground. Neither can I attempt in this\r\nimmediate connection to offer any justification for the statement which\r\nmight or should be sufficient to satisfy a stubborn skeptic. I must be\r\ncontent for the present with the bare assertion that the prevailing\r\nabuses and sins, which have made reform necessary, are all of them\r\nassociated with the prodigious concentration of wealth, and of the power\r\nexercised by wealth, in the hands of a few men. I am far from believing\r\nthat this concentration of economic power is wholly an undesirable\r\nthing, and I am also far from believing that the men in whose hands this\r\npower is concentrated deserve, on the whole, any exceptional moral\r\nreprobation for the manner in which it has been used. In certain\r\nrespects they have served their country well, and in almost every\r\nrespect their moral or immoral standards are those of the great majority\r\nof their fellow-countrymen. But it is none the less true that the\r\npolitical corruption, the unwise economic organization, and the legal\r\nsupport afforded to certain economic privileges are all under existing\r\nconditions due to the malevolent social influence of individual and\r\nincorporated American wealth; and it is equally true that these abuses,\r\nand the excessive \"money power\" with which they are associated, have\r\noriginated in the peculiar freedom which the American tradition and\r\norganization have granted to the individual. Up to a certain point that\r\nfreedom has been and still is beneficial. Beyond that point it is not\r\nmerely harmful; it is by way of being fatal. Efficient regulation there\r\nmust be; and it must be regulation which will strike, not at the\r\nsymptoms of the evil, but at its roots. The existing concentration of\r\nwealth and financial power in the hands of a few irresponsible men is\r\nthe inevitable outcome of the chaotic individualism of our political and\r\neconomic organization, while at the same time it is inimical to\r\ndemocracy, because it tends to erect political abuses and social\r\ninequalities into a system. The inference which follows may be\r\ndisagreeable, but it is not to be escaped. In becoming responsible for\r\nthe subordination of the individual to the demand of a dominant and\r\nconstructive national purpose, the American state will in effect be\r\nmaking itself responsible for a morally and socially desirable\r\ndistribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe consequences, then, of converting our American national destiny into\r\na national purpose are beginning to be revolutionary. When the Promise\r\nof American life is conceived as a national ideal, whose fulfillment is\r\na matter of artful and laborious work, the effect thereof is\r\nsubstantially to identify the national purpose with the social problem.\r\nWhat the American people of the present and the future have really been\r\npromised by our patriotic prophecies is an attempt to solve that\r\nproblem. They have been promised on American soil comfort, prosperity,\r\nand the opportunity for self-improvement; and the lesson of the existing\r\ncrisis is that such a Promise can never be redeemed by an indiscriminate\r\nindividual scramble for wealth. The individual competition, even when it\r\nstarts under fair conditions and rules, results, not only, as it should,\r\nin the triumph of the strongest, but in the attempt to perpetuate the\r\nvictory; and it is this attempt which must be recognized and forestalled\r\nin the interest of the American national purpose. The way to realize a\r\npurpose is, not to leave it to chance, but to keep it loyally in mind,\r\nand adopt means proper to the importance and the difficulty of the task.\r\nNo voluntary association of individuals, resourceful and disinterested\r\nthough they be, is competent to assume the responsibility. The problem\r\nbelongs to the American national democracy, and its solution must be\r\nattempted chiefly by means of official national action.\r\n\r\nNeither can its attempted solution be escaped. When they are confronted\r\nby the individual sacrifices which the fulfillment of their national\r\nPromise demands, American political leaders will find many excuses for\r\nignoring the responsibility thereby implied; but the difficulty of such\r\nan attempted evasion will consist in the reënforcement of the historical\r\ntradition by a logical and a practical necessity. The American problem\r\nis the social problem partly because the social problem is the\r\ndemocratic problem. American political and social leaders will find that\r\nin a democracy the problem cannot be evaded. The American people have no\r\nirremediable political grievances. No good American denies the\r\ndesirability of popular sovereignty and of a government which should\r\nsomehow represent the popular will. While our national institutions may\r\nnot be a perfect embodiment of these doctrines, a decisive and a\r\nresolute popular majority has the power to alter American institutions\r\nand give them a more immediately representative character. Existing\r\npolitical evils and abuses are serious enough; but inasmuch as they have\r\ncome into being, not against the will, but with the connivance of the\r\nAmerican people, the latter are responsible for their persistence. In\r\nthe long run, consequently, the ordinary American will have nothing\r\nirremediable to complain about except economic and social inequalities.\r\nIn Europe such will not be the case. The several European peoples have,\r\nand will continue to have, political grievances, because such grievances\r\nare the inevitable consequence of their national history and their\r\ninternational situation; and as long as these grievances remain, the\r\nmore difficult social problem will be subordinated to an agitation for\r\npolitical emancipation. But the American people, having achieved\r\ndemocratic institutions, have nothing to do but to turn them to good\r\naccount. In so far as the social problem is a real problem and the\r\neconomic grievance a real grievance, they are bound under the American\r\npolitical system to come eventually to the surface and to demand express\r\nand intelligent consideration. A democratic ideal makes the social\r\nproblem inevitable and its attempted solution indispensable.\r\n\r\nI am fully aware, as already intimated, that the forgoing interpretation\r\nof the Promise of American life will seem fantastic and obnoxious to the\r\ngreat majority of Americans, and I am far from claiming that any reasons\r\nas yet alleged afford a sufficient justification for such a radical\r\ntransformation of the traditional national policy and democratic creed.\r\nAll that can be claimed is that if a democratic ideal makes an express\r\nconsideration of the social problem inevitable, it is of the first\r\nimportance for Americans to realize this truth and to understand the\r\nreasons for it. Furthermore, the assumption is worth making, in case the\r\ntraditional American system is breaking down, because a more highly\r\nsocialized democracy is the only practical substitute on the part of\r\nconvinced democrats for an excessively individualized democracy. Of\r\ncourse, it will be claimed that the traditional system is not breaking\r\ndown, and again no absolute proof of the breakdown has been or can be\r\nalleged. Nevertheless, the serious nature of contemporary American\r\npolitical and economic symptoms at least pointedly suggests the\r\nexistence of some radical disease, and when one assumes such to be the\r\ncase, one cannot be accused of borrowing trouble, I shall, consequently,\r\nstart from such an assumption, and make an attempt to explain\r\ncontemporary American problems as in part the result of the practice of\r\nan erroneous democratic theory. The attempt will necessarily involve a\r\nbrief review of our political and economic history, undertaken for the\r\npurpose of tracing the traditional ideas of their origin and testing\r\nthem by their performances. There will follow a detailed examination of\r\ncurrent political and economic problems and conditions--considered in\r\nrelation both to the American democratic tradition and to the proposed\r\nrevision thereof. In view of the increasing ferment of American\r\npolitical and economic thought, no apology is necessary for submitting\r\nour traditional ideas and practices to an examination from an\r\nuntraditional point of view. I need scarcely add that the untraditional\r\npoint of view will contain little or no original matter. The only\r\nnovelty such an inquiry can claim is the novelty of applying ideas, long\r\nfamiliar to foreign political thinkers, to the subject-matter of\r\nAmerican life. When applied to American life, this group of ideas\r\nassumes a somewhat new complexion and significance; and the promise of\r\nsuch a small amount of novelty will, I trust, tempt even a disapproving\r\nreader to follow somewhat farther the course of the argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERALISTS AND THE REPUBLICANS\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the following review of American political ideas and\r\npractices is, it must be premised, critical rather than narrative or\r\nexpository. I am not seeking to justify a political and economic theory\r\nby an appeal to historical facts. I am seeking, on the contrary, to\r\nplace some kind of an estimate and interpretation upon American\r\npolitical ideas and achievements; and this estimate and interpretation\r\nis determined chiefly by a preconceived ideal. The acceptability of such\r\nan estimate and interpretation will, of course, depend at bottom upon\r\nthe number of important facts which it explains and the number which it\r\neither neglects or distorts. No doubt, certain omissions and distortions\r\nare inevitable in an attempt of this kind; but I need scarcely add that\r\nthe greatest care has been taken to avoid them. In case the proposed\r\nconception of the Promise of American life cannot be applied to our\r\npolitical and economic history without essential perversion, it must\r\nobviously fall to the ground; and as a matter of fact, the ideal itself\r\nhas been sensibly modified during the course of this attempt to give it\r\nan historical application. In spite of all these modifications it\r\nremains, however, an extremely controversial review. Our political and\r\neconomic past is, in a measure, challenged in order to justify our\r\npolitical and social future. The values placed upon many political\r\nideas, tendencies, and achievements differ radically from the values\r\nplaced upon them either by their originators and partisans or in some\r\ncases by the majority of American historians. The review, consequently,\r\nwill meet with a far larger portion of instinctive opposition and\r\ndistrust than it will of acquiescence. The whole traditional set of\r\nvalues which it criticises is almost as much alive to-day as it was two\r\ngenerations ago, and it forms a background to the political faith of\r\nthe great majority of Americans. Whatever favor a radical criticism can\r\nobtain, it must win on its merits both as an adequate interpretation of\r\nour political past and as an outlook towards the solution of our present\r\nand future political and economic problems.\r\n\r\nThe material for this critical estimate must be sought, not so much in\r\nthe events of our national career, as in the ideas which have influenced\r\nits course. Closely as these ideas are associated with the actual course\r\nof American development, their meaning and their remoter tendencies have\r\nnot been wholly realized therein, because beyond a certain point no\r\nattempt was made to think out these ideas candidly and consistently. For\r\none generation American statesmen were vigorous and fruitful political\r\nthinkers; but the time soon came when Americans ceased to criticise\r\ntheir own ideas, and since that time the meaning of many of our\r\nfundamental national conceptions has been partly obscured, as well as\r\npartly expressed, by the facts of our national growth. Consequently we\r\nmust go behind these facts and scrutinize, with more caution than is\r\nusually considered necessary, the adequacy and consistency of the\r\nunderlying ideas. And I believe that the results of such a scrutiny will\r\nbe very illuminating. It will be found that from the start there has\r\nbeen one group of principles at work which have made for American\r\nnational fulfillment, and another group of principles which has made for\r\nAmerican national distraction; and that these principles are as much\r\nalive to-day as they were when Jefferson wrote the Kentucky resolutions\r\nor when Jackson, at the dinner of the Jefferson Club, toasted the\r\npreservation of the Union. But while these warring principles always\r\nhave been, and still are, alive, they have never, in my opinion, been\r\nproperly discriminated one from another; and until such a discrimination\r\nis made, the lesson cannot be profitably applied to the solution of our\r\ncontemporary national problems.\r\n\r\nAll our histories recognize, of course, the existence from the very\r\nbeginning of our national career of two different and, in some respects,\r\nantagonistic groups of political ideas,--the ideas which were\r\nrepresented by Jefferson, and the ideas which were represented by\r\nHamilton. It is very generally understood, also, that neither the\r\nJeffersonian nor the Hamiltonian doctrine was entirely adequate, and\r\nthat in order to reach a correct understanding of the really formative\r\nconstituent in the complex of American national life, a combination must\r\nbe made of both Republicanism and Federalism. But while the necessity of\r\nsuch a combination is fully realized, I do not believe that it has ever\r\nbeen mixed in just the proper proportions. We are content to say with\r\nWebster that the prosperity of American institutions depends upon the\r\nunity and inseparability of individual and local liberties and a\r\nnational union. We are content to declare that the United States must\r\nremain somehow a free and a united country, because there can be no\r\ncomplete unity without liberty and no salutary liberty outside of a\r\nUnion. But the difficulties with this phrase, its implications and\r\nconsequences, we do not sufficiently consider. It is enough that we have\r\nfound an optimistic formula wherewith to unite the divergent aspects of\r\nthe Republican, and Federalist doctrines.\r\n\r\nWe must begin, consequently, with critical accounts of the ideas both of\r\nJefferson and of Hamilton; and we must seek to discover wherein each of\r\nthese sets of ideas was right, and wherein each was wrong; in what\r\nproportions they were subsequently combined in order to form \"our noble\r\nnational theory,\" and what were the advantages, the limitations, and the\r\neffects of this combination. I shall not disguise the fact that, on the\r\nwhole, my own preferences are on the side of Hamilton rather than of\r\nJefferson. He was the sound thinker, the constructive statesman, the\r\ncandid and honorable, if erring, gentleman; while Jefferson was the\r\namiable enthusiast, who understood his fellow-countrymen better and\r\ntrusted them more than his rival, but who was incapable either of\r\nuniting with his fine phrases a habit of candid and honorable private\r\ndealing or of embodying those phrases in a set of efficient\r\ninstitutions. But although Hamilton is much the finer man and much the\r\nsounder thinker and statesman, there were certain limitations in his\r\nideas and sympathies the effects of which have been almost as baleful as\r\nthe effects of Jefferson's intellectual superficiality and insincerity.\r\nHe perverted the American national idea almost as much as Jefferson\r\nperverted the American democratic idea, and the proper relation of these\r\ntwo fundamental conceptions one to another cannot be completely\r\nunderstood until this double perversion is corrected.\r\n\r\nTo make Hamilton and Jefferson exclusively responsible for this double\r\nperversion is, however, by no means fair. The germs of it are to be\r\nfound in the political ideas and prejudices with which the American\r\npeople emerged from their successful Revolutionary War. At that time,\r\nindeed, the opposition between the Republican and the Federalist\r\ndoctrines had not become definite and acute; and it is fortunate that\r\nsuch was the case, because if the opponents of an efficient Federal\r\nconstitution had been organized and had been possessed of the full\r\ncourage and consciousness of their convictions, that instrument would\r\nnever have been accepted, or it would have been accepted only in a much\r\nmore mutilated and enfeebled condition. Nevertheless, the different\r\npolitical points of view which afterwards developed into Hamiltonian\r\nFederalism and Jeffersonian Republicanism were latent in the interests\r\nand opinions of the friends and of the opponents of an efficient Federal\r\ngovernment; and these interests and opinions were the natural product of\r\ncontemporary American economic and political conditions.\r\n\r\nBoth Federalism and anti-Federalism were the mixed issue of an interest\r\nand a theory. The interest which lay behind Federalism was that of\r\nwell-to-do citizens in a stable political and social order, and this\r\ninterest aroused them to favor and to seek some form of political\r\norganization which was capable of protecting their property and\r\npromoting its interest. They were the friends of liberty because they\r\nwere in a position to benefit largely by the possession of liberty; and\r\nthey wanted a strong central government because only by such means could\r\ntheir liberties, which consisted fundamentally in the ability to enjoy\r\nand increase their property, be guaranteed. Their interests were\r\nthreatened by the disorganized state governments in two different but\r\nconnected respects. These governments did not seem able to secure either\r\ninternal order or external peace. In their domestic policy the states\r\nthreatened to become the prey of a factious radical democracy, and their\r\nrelations one to another were by way of being constantly embroiled.\r\nUnless something could be done, it looked as if they would drift in a\r\ncondition either of internecine warfare without profit or, at best, of\r\npeace without security. A centralized and efficient government would do\r\naway with both of these threats. It would prevent or curb all but the\r\nmost serious sectional disputes, while at the same time it would provide\r\na much stronger guarantee for internal political order and social\r\nstability. An equally strong interest lay at the roots of\r\nanti-Federalism and it had its theory, though this theory was less\r\nmature and definite. Behind the opposition to a centralized government\r\nwere the interests and the prejudices of the mass of the American\r\npeople,--the people who were, comparatively speaking, lacking in money,\r\nin education, and in experience. The Revolutionary War, while not\r\nexclusively the work of the popular element in the community, had\r\nundoubtedly increased considerably its power and influence. A large\r\nproportion of the well-to-do colonial Americans had been active or\r\npassive Tories, and had either been ruined or politically disqualified\r\nby the Revolution. Their successful opponents reorganized the state\r\ngovernments in a radical democratic spirit. The power of the state was\r\nusually concentrated in the hands of a single assembly, to whom both the\r\nexecutive and the courts were subservient; and this method of\r\norganization was undoubtedly designed to give immediate and complete\r\neffect to the will of a popular majority. The temper of the local\r\ndemocracies, which, for the most part, controlled the state governments,\r\nwas insubordinate, factious, and extremely independent. They disliked\r\nthe idea of a centralized Federal government because a supreme power\r\nwould be thereby constituted which could interfere with the freedom of\r\nlocal public opinion and thwart its will. No less than the Federalists,\r\nthey believed in freedom; but the kind of freedom they wanted, was\r\nfreedom from anything but local interference. The ordinary American\r\ndemocrat felt that the power of _his_ personality and _his_ point of\r\nview would be diminished by the efficient centralization of political\r\nauthority. He had no definite intention of using the democratic state\r\ngovernments for anti-social or revolutionary purposes, but he was\r\nself-willed and unruly in temper; and his savage treatment of the Tories\r\nduring and after the Revolution had given him a taste of the sweets of\r\nconfiscation. The spirit of his democracy was self-reliant,\r\nundisciplined, suspicious of authority, equalitarian, and\r\nindividualistic.\r\n\r\nWith all their differences, however, the Federalists and their opponents\r\nhad certain common opinions and interests, and it was these common\r\nopinions and interests which prevented the split from becoming\r\nirremediable. The men of both parties were individualist in spirit, and\r\nthey were chiefly interested in the great American task of improving\r\ntheir own condition in this world. They both wanted a government which\r\nwould secure them freedom of action for this purpose. The difference\r\nbetween them was really less a difference of purpose than of the means\r\nwhereby a purpose should be accomplished. The Federalists, representing\r\nas they did chiefly the people of wealth and education, demanded a\r\ngovernment adequate to protect existing propertied rights; but they were\r\nnot seeking any exceptional privileges--except those traditionally\r\nassociated with the ownership of private property. The anti-Federalists,\r\non the other hand, having less to protect and more to acquire, insisted\r\nrather upon being let alone than in being protected. They expressed\r\nthemselves sometimes in such an extremely insubordinate manner as almost\r\nto threaten social disorder, but were very far from being fundamentally\r\nanti-social in interest or opinion. They were all by way of being\r\nproperty-owners, and they all expected to benefit by freedom from\r\ninterference in the acquisition of wealth. It was this community of\r\ninterest and point of view which prepared the way, not only for the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, but for the loyalty it subsequently\r\ninspired in the average American.\r\n\r\nIt remains none the less true, however, that the division of interest\r\nand the controversy thereby provoked was sharp and brought about certain\r\nvery unfortunate consequences. Inasmuch as the anti-Federalists were\r\nunruly democrats and were suspicious of any efficient political\r\nauthority, the Federalists came, justly or unjustly, to identify both\r\nanti-Federalism and democracy with political disorder and social\r\ninstability. They came, that is, to have much the same opinion of\r\nradical democracy as an English peer might have had at the time of the\r\nFrench Revolution; and this prejudice, which was unjust but not\r\nunnatural, was very influential in determining the character of the\r\nFederal Constitution. That instrument was framed, not as the expression\r\nof a democratic creed, but partly as a legal fortress against the\r\npossible errors and failings of democracy. The federalist point of view\r\nresembled that of the later constitutional liberals in France. The\r\npolitical ideal and benefit which they prized most highly was that of\r\nliberty, and the Constitution was framed chiefly for the purpose of\r\nsecuring liberty from any possible dangers. Popular liberty must be\r\nprotected against possible administrative or executive tyranny by free\r\nrepresentative institutions. Individual liberty must be protected\r\nagainst the action of an unjust majority by the strongest possible legal\r\nguarantees. And above all the general liberties of the community must\r\nnot be endangered by any inefficiency of the government as a whole. The\r\nonly method whereby these complicated and, in a measure, conflicting\r\nends could be attained was by a system of checks and balances, which\r\nwould make the executive, legislative, and judicial departments of the\r\ngovernment independent of one another, while at the same time endowing\r\neach department with all the essentials of efficient action within its\r\nown sphere. But such a method of political organization was calculated\r\nto thwart the popular will, just in so far as that will did not conform\r\nto what the Federalists believed to be the essentials of a stable\r\npolitical and social order. It was antagonistic to democracy as that\r\nword was then, and is still to a large extent, understood.\r\n\r\nThe extent of this antagonism to democracy, if not in intention at least\r\nin effect, is frequently over-rated. The antagonism depends upon the\r\nidentification of democracy with a political organization for expressing\r\nimmediately and completely the will of the majority--whatever that will\r\nmay be; and such a conception of democracy contains only part of the\r\ntruth. Nevertheless the founders of the Constitution did succeed in\r\ngiving some effect to their distrust of the democratic principle, no\r\nmatter how conservatively defined; and this was at once a grave error on\r\ntheir part and a grave misfortune for the American state. Founded as the\r\nnational government is, partly on a distrust of the American democracy,\r\nit has always tended to make the democracy somewhat suspicious of the\r\nnational government. This mutual suspicion, while it has been limited in\r\nscope and diminished by the action of time, constitutes a manifest\r\nimpediment to the efficient action of the American political system. The\r\ngreat lesson of American political experience, as we shall see, is\r\nrather that of interdependence than of incompatibility between an\r\nefficient national organization and a group of radical democratic\r\ninstitutions and ideals; and the meaning of this lesson has been\r\nobscured, because the Federal organization has not been constituted in a\r\nsufficiently democratic spirit, and because, consequently, it has tended\r\nto provoke distrust on the part of good democrats. At every stage in the\r\nhistory of American political ideas and practice we shall meet with the\r\nunfortunate effects of this partial antagonism.\r\n\r\nThe error of the Federalists can, however, be excused by many\r\nextenuating circumstances. Democracy as an ideal was misunderstood in\r\n1786, and it was possessed of little or no standing in theory or\r\ntradition. Moreover, the radical American democrats were doing much to\r\ndeserve the misgivings of the Federalists. Their ideas were narrow,\r\nimpracticable, and hazardous; and they were opposed to the essential\r\npolitical need of the time--viz. the constitution of an efficient\r\nFederal government. The Federalists may have misinterpreted and\r\nperverted the proper purpose of American national organization, but they\r\ncould have avoided such misinterpretation only by an extraordinary\r\ndisplay of political insight and a heroic superiority to natural\r\nprejudice. Their error sinks into insignificance compared with the\r\nenormous service which they rendered to the American people and the\r\nAmerican cause. Without their help there might not have been any\r\nAmerican nation at all, or it might have been born under a far darker\r\ncloud of political suspicion and animosity. The instrument which they\r\ncreated, with all its faults, proved capable of becoming both the organ\r\nof an efficient national government and the fundamental law of a\r\npotentially democratic state. It has proved capable of flexible\r\ndevelopment both in function and in purpose, and it has been developed\r\nin both these directions without any sacrifice of integrity.\r\n\r\nIts success has been due to the fact that its makers, with all their\r\napprehensions about democracy, were possessed of a wise and positive\r\npolitical faith. They believed in liberty. They believed that the\r\nessential condition of fruitful liberty was an efficient central\r\ngovernment. They knew that no government could be efficient unless its\r\npowers equaled its responsibilities. They were willing to trust to such\r\na government the security and the welfare of the American people. The\r\nConstitution has proved capable of development chiefly as the instrument\r\nof these positive political ideas. Thanks to the theory of implied\r\npowers, to the liberal construction of the Supreme Court during the\r\nfirst forty years of its existence, and to the results of the Civil War\r\nthe Federal government has, on the whole, become more rather than less\r\nefficient as the national political organ of the American people. Almost\r\nfrom the start American life has grown more and more national in\r\nsubstance, in such wise that a rigid constitution which could not have\r\nbeen developed in a national direction would have been an increasing\r\nsource of irritation and protest. But this reënforcement of the\r\nsubstance of American national life has, until recently, found an\r\nadequate expression in the increasing scope and efficiency of the\r\nFederal government. The Federalists had the insight to anticipate the\r\nkind of government which their country needed; and this was a great and\r\na rare achievement--all the more so because they were obliged in a\r\nmeasure to impose it on their fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another face to the shield. The Constitution was the\r\nexpression not only of a political faith, but also of political fears.\r\nIt was wrought both as the organ of the national interest and as the\r\nbulwark of certain individual and local rights. The Federalists sought\r\nto surround private property, freedom of contract, and personal liberty\r\nwith an impregnable legal fortress; and they were forced by their\r\nopponents to amend the original draft of the Constitution in order to\r\ninclude a still more stringent bill of individual and state rights. Now\r\nI am far from pretending that these legal restrictions have not had\r\ntheir value in American national history, and were not the expression of\r\nan essential element in the composition and the ideal of the American\r\nnation. The security of private property and personal liberty, and a\r\nproper distribution of activity between the local and the central\r\ngovernments, demanded at that time, and within limits still demand,\r\nadequate legal guarantees. It remains none the less true, however, that\r\nevery popular government should in the end, and after a necessarily\r\nprolonged deliberation, possess the power of taking any action, which,\r\nin the opinion of a decisive majority of the people, is demanded by the\r\npublic welfare. Such is not the case with the government organized\r\nunder the Federal Constitution. In respect to certain fundamental\r\nprovisions, which necessarily receive the most rigid interpretation on\r\nthe part of the courts, it is practically unmodifiable. A very small\r\npercentage of the American people can in this respect permanently thwart\r\nthe will of an enormous majority, and there can be no justification for\r\nsuch a condition on any possible theory of popular Sovereignty. This\r\ndefect has not hitherto had very many practical inconveniences, but it\r\nis an absolute violation of the theory and the spirit of American\r\ndemocratic institutions. The time may come when the fulfillment of a\r\njustifiable democratic purpose may demand the limitation of certain\r\nrights, to which the Constitution affords such absolute guarantees; and\r\nin that case the American democracy might be forced to seek by\r\nrevolutionary means the accomplishment of a result which should be\r\nattainable under the law.\r\n\r\nIt was, none the less, a great good thing that the Union under the new\r\nConstitution triumphed. Americans have more reason to be proud of its\r\ntriumph than of any other event in their national history. The formation\r\nof an effective nation out of the thirteen original colonies was a\r\npolitical achievement for which there was no historical precedent. Up to\r\nthat time large countries had been brought, if not held, together by\r\nmilitary force or by a long process of gradually closer historical\r\nassociation. Small and partly independent communities had combined one\r\nwith another only on compulsion. The necessities of joint defense might\r\noccasionally drive them into temporary union, but they would not stay\r\nunited. They preferred a precarious and tumultuous independence to a\r\ncombination with neighboring communities, which brought security at the\r\nprice of partial subordination and loyal coöperation. Even the provinces\r\nwhich composed the United Netherlands never submitted to an effective\r\npolitical union during the active and vital period of their history. The\r\nsmall American states had apparently quite as many reasons for\r\nseparation as the small Grecian and Italian states. The military\r\nnecessities of the Revolution had welded them only into a loose and\r\nfeeble confederation, and a successful revolution does not constitute a\r\nvery good precedent for political subordination. The colonies were\r\ndivided from one another by difficulties of communication, by\r\nvariations in economic conditions and social customs, by divergent\r\ninterests, and above all by a rampant provincial and separatist spirit.\r\nOn the other hand, they were united by a common language, by a common\r\npolitical and legal tradition, and by the fact that none of them had\r\never been really independent sovereign states. Nobody dared or cared to\r\nobject to union in the abstract; nobody advocated the alternative of\r\ncomplete separation; it was only a strong efficient union which aroused\r\nthe opposition of the Clintons and the Patrick Henrys. Nevertheless, the\r\nconditions making for separation have the appearance of being more\r\ninsistent and powerful than the conditions making for an effective\r\nunion. Disunion was so easy. Union was so difficult. If the states had\r\nonly kept on drifting a little longer, they would, at least for a while,\r\ninevitably have drifted apart. They were saved from such a fate chiefly\r\nby the insight and energy of a few unionist leaders--of whom Washington\r\nand Hamilton were the most important.\r\n\r\nPerhaps American conditions were such that eventually some kind of a\r\nnational government was sure to come; but the important point is that\r\nwhen it came, it came as the result of forethought and will rather than\r\nof compulsion. \"It seems to have been reserved,\" says Hamilton in the\r\nvery first number of the _Federalist_, \"to the people of this country by\r\ntheir conduct and example, to decide the important question whether\r\nsocieties of men are really capable or not of establishing good\r\ngovernment from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever\r\ndestined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and\r\nforce.\" Americans deliberately selected the better part. It is true that\r\nthe evil effects of a loose union were only too apparent, and that\r\npublic safety, order, and private property were obviously endangered by\r\nthe feeble machinery of Federal government. Nevertheless, conditions had\r\nnot become intolerable. The terrible cost of disunion in money, blood,\r\nhumiliation, and hatred had not actually been paid. It might well have\r\nseemed cheaper to most Americans to drift on a little longer than to\r\nmake the sacrifices and to undertake the labor demanded by the formation\r\nof an effective union. There were plenty of arguments by which a policy\r\nof letting things alone could be plausibly defended, and the precedents\r\nwere all in its favor. Other people had acquired such political\r\nexperience as they were capable of assimilating, first by drifting into\r\nsome intolerable excess or some distressing error, and then by\r\nundergoing some violent process of purgation or reform. But it is the\r\ndistinction of our own country that at the critical moment of its\r\nhistory, the policy of drift was stopped before a virulent disease had\r\nnecessitated a violent and exhausting remedy.\r\n\r\nThis result was achieved chiefly by virtue of capable, energetic, and\r\npatriotic leadership. It is stated that if the Constitution had been\r\nsubjected to a popular vote as soon as the labors of the Convention\r\nterminated, it would probably have been rejected in almost every state\r\nin the Union. That it was finally adopted, particularly by certain\r\nimportant states, was distinctly due to the conversion of public\r\nopinion, by means of powerful and convincing argument. The American\r\npeople steered the proper course because their leaders convinced them of\r\nthe proper course to steer; and the behavior of the many who followed\r\nbehind is as exemplary as is that of the few who pointed the way. A\r\nbetter example could not be asked of the successful operation of the\r\ndemocratic institutions, and it would be as difficult to find its\r\nparallel in the history of our own as in the history of European\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFEDERALISM AND REPUBLICANISM AS OPPONENTS\r\n\r\nFortunately for the American nation the unionists, who wrought the\r\nConstitution, were substantially the same body of men as the Federalist\r\nparty who organized under its provisions an efficient national\r\ngovernment. The work of Washington, Hamilton, and their associates\r\nduring the first two administrations was characterized by the same\r\nadmirable qualities as the work of the makers of the Constitution, and\r\nit is of similar importance. A vigorous, positive, constructive national\r\npolicy was outlined and carried substantially into effect,--a policy\r\nthat implied a faith in the powers of an efficient government to advance\r\nthe national interest, and which justified the faith by actually meeting\r\nthe critical problems of the time with a series of wise legislative\r\nmeasures. Hamilton's part in this constructive legislation was, of\r\ncourse, more important than it had been in the framing of the\r\nConstitution. During Washington's two administrations the United States\r\nwas governed practically by his ideas, if not by his will; and the sound\r\nand unsound parts of his political creed can consequently be more\r\ndefinitely disentangled than they can be during the years when the\r\nConstitution was being wrought. The Constitution was in many respects a\r\ncompromise, whereas the ensuing constructive legislation was a tolerably\r\npure example of Hamiltonian Federalism. It will be instructive,\r\nconsequently, to examine the trend of this Hamiltonian policy, and seek\r\nto discover wherein it started the country on the right path, and\r\nwherein it sought to commit the national government to a more dubious\r\nline of action.\r\n\r\nHamilton's great object as Secretary of the Treasury was that of making\r\nthe organization of the national finances serve the cause of a\r\nconstructive national policy. He wished to strengthen the Federal\r\ngovernment by a striking exhibition of its serviceability, and by\r\ncreating both a strong sentiment and an influential interest in its\r\nfavor. To this end he committed the nation to a policy of scrupulous\r\nfinancial honesty, which has helped to make it ever since the mainstay\r\nof sound American finance. He secured the consent of Congress to the\r\nrecognition at their face value of the debts incurred during the war\r\nboth by the Confederacy and by the individual states. He created in the\r\nNational Bank an efficient fiscal agent for the Treasury Department and\r\na means whereby it could give stability to the banking system of the\r\ncountry. Finally he sought by means of his proposed fiscal and\r\ncommercial policy to make the central government the effective promoter\r\nof a wholesome and many-sided national development. He detected the\r\ndanger to political stability and self-control which would result from\r\nthe continued growth of the United States as a merely agricultural and\r\ntrading community, and he saw that it was necessary to cultivate\r\nmanufacturing industries and technical knowledge and training, because\r\ndiversified activity and a well-rounded social and economic life brings\r\nwith it national balance and security.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the several aspects of Hamilton's policy can be discerned a\r\ndefinite theory of governmental functions. The central government is to\r\nbe used, not merely to maintain the Constitution, but to promote the\r\nnational interest and to consolidate the national organization. Hamilton\r\nsaw clearly that the American Union was far from being achieved when\r\nthe Constitution was accepted by the states and the machinery of the\r\nFederal government set in motion. A good start had been made, but the\r\nway in which to keep what had been gained was to seek for more. Unionism\r\nmust be converted into a positive policy which labored to strengthen the\r\nnational interest and organization, discredit possible or actual\r\ndisunionist ideas and forces, and increase the national spirit. All this\r\nimplied an active interference with the natural course of American\r\neconomic and political business and its regulation and guidance in the\r\nnational direction. It implied a conscious and indefatigable attempt on\r\nthe part of the national leaders to promote the national welfare. It\r\nimplied the predominance in American political life of the men who had\r\nthe energy and the insight to discriminate between those ideas and\r\ntendencies which promoted the national welfare, and those ideas and\r\ntendencies whereby it was imperiled. It implied, in fine, the\r\nperpetuation of the same kind of leadership which had guided the country\r\nsafely through the dangers of the critical period, and the perpetuation\r\nof the purposes which inspired that leadership.\r\n\r\nSo far I, at least, have no fault to find with implications of\r\nHamilton's Federalism, but unfortunately his policy was in certain other\r\nrespects tainted with a more doubtful tendency. On the persistent\r\nvitality of Hamilton's national principle depends the safety of the\r\nAmerican republic and the fertility of the American idea, but he did not\r\nseek a sufficiently broad, popular basis for the realization of those\r\nideas. He was betrayed by his fears and by his lack of faith. Believing\r\nas he did, and far more than he had any right to believe, that he was\r\nstill fighting for the cause of social stability and political order\r\nagainst the seven devils of anarchy and dissolution, he thought it\r\nnecessary to bestow upon the central government the support of a strong\r\nspecial interest. During the Constitutional Convention he had failed to\r\nsecure the adoption of certain institutions which in his opinion would\r\nhave established as the guardian of the Constitution an aristocracy of\r\nability; and he now insisted all the more upon the plan of attaching to\r\nthe Federal government the support of well-to-do people. As we have\r\nseen, the Constitution had been framed and its adoption secured chiefly\r\nby citizens of education and means; and the way had been prepared,\r\nconsequently, for the attempt of Hamilton to rally this class as a class\r\nmore than ever to the support of the Federal government. They were the\r\npeople who had most to lose by political instability or inefficiency,\r\nand they must be brought to lend their influence to the perpetuation of\r\na centralized political authority. Hence he believed a considerable\r\nnational debt to be a good thing for the Federal national interest, and\r\nhe insisted strenuously upon the assumption by the Federal government of\r\nthe state war-debts. He conceived the Constitution and the Union as a\r\nvalley of peace and plenty which had to be fortified against the\r\nmarauders by the heavy ramparts of borrowed money and the big guns of a\r\npropertied interest.\r\n\r\nIn so doing Hamilton believed that he was (to vary the metaphor) loading\r\nthe ship of state with a necessary ballast, whereas in truth he was\r\ndisturbing its balance and preventing it from sailing free. He succeeded\r\nin imbuing both men of property and the mass of the \"plain people\" with\r\nthe idea that the well-to-do were the peculiar beneficiaries of the\r\nAmerican Federal organization, the result being that the rising\r\ndemocracy came more than ever to distrust the national government.\r\nInstead of seeking to base the perpetuation of the Union upon the\r\ninterested motives of a minority of well-to-do citizens, he would have\r\nbeen far wiser to have frankly intrusted its welfare to the good-will of\r\nthe whole people. But unfortunately he was prevented from so doing by\r\nthe limitation both of his sympathies and ideas. He was possessed by the\r\nEnglish conception of a national state, based on the domination of\r\nspecial privileged orders and interests; and he failed to understand\r\nthat the permanent support of the American national organization could\r\nnot be found in anything less than the whole American democracy. The\r\nAmerican Union was a novel and a promising political creation, not\r\nbecause it was a democracy, for there had been plenty of previous\r\ndemocracies, and not because it was a nation, for there had been plenty\r\nof previous nations, but precisely and entirely because it was a\r\ndemocratic nation,--a nation committed by its institutions and\r\naspirations to realize the democratic idea.\r\n\r\nMuch, consequently, as we may value Hamilton's work and for the most\r\npart his ideas, it must be admitted that the popular disfavor with\r\nwhich he came to be regarded had its measure of justice. This disfavor\r\nwas indeed partly the result of his resolute adherence to a wise but an\r\nunpopular foreign policy; and the way in which this policy was carried\r\nthrough by Washington, Hamilton, and their followers, in spite of the\r\ngeneral dislike which it inspired, deserves the warmest praise. But\r\nHamilton's unpopularity was fundamentally due to deeper causes. He and\r\nhis fellow-Federalists did not understand their fellow-countrymen and\r\nsympathize with their purposes, and naturally they were repaid with\r\nmisunderstanding and suspicion. He ceased, after Washington's\r\nretirement, to be a national leader, and became the leader of a faction;\r\nand before his death his party ceased to be the national party, and came\r\nto represent only a section and a class. In this way it irretrievably\r\nlost public support, and not even the miserable failure of Jefferson's\r\npolicy of embargo could persuade the American people to restore the\r\nFederalists to power. As a party organization they disappeared entirely\r\nafter the second English war, and unfortunately much that was good in\r\nHamilton's political point of view disappeared with the bad. But by its\r\nfailure one good result was finally established. For better or worse the\r\nUnited States had become a democracy as well as a nation, and its\r\nnational task was not that of escaping the dangers of democracy, but of\r\nrealizing its responsibilities and opportunities.\r\n\r\nIt did not take Hamilton's opponents long to discover that his ideas and\r\nplans were in some respects inimical to democracy; and the consequence\r\nwas that Hamilton was soon confronted by one of the most implacable and\r\nunscrupulous oppositions which ever abused a faithful and useful public\r\nservant. This opposition was led by Jefferson, and while it most\r\nunfortunately lacked Hamilton's statesmanship and sound constructive\r\nideas, it possessed the one saving quality which Hamilton himself\r\nlacked: Jefferson was filled with a sincere, indiscriminate, and\r\nunlimited faith in the American people. He was according to his own\r\nlights a radical and unqualified democrat, and as a democrat he fought\r\nmost bitterly what he considered to be the aristocratic or even\r\nmonarchic tendency of Hamilton's policy. Much of the denunciation which\r\nhe and his followers lavished upon Hamilton was unjust, and much of the\r\nfight which they put up against his measures was contrary to the public\r\nwelfare. They absolutely failed to give him credit for the patriotism of\r\nhis intentions or for the merit of his achievements, and their\r\nunscrupulous and unfair tactics established a baleful tradition in\r\nAmerican party warfare. But Jefferson was wholly right in believing that\r\nhis country was nothing, if not a democracy, and that any tendency to\r\nimpair the integrity of the democratic idea could be productive only of\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Jefferson's conception of democracy was meager, narrow,\r\nand self-contradictory; and just because his ideas prevailed, while\r\nHamilton toward the end of his life lost his influence, the consequences\r\nof Jefferson's imperfect conception of democracy have been much more\r\nserious than the consequences of Hamilton's inadequate conception of\r\nAmerican nationality. In Jefferson's mind democracy was tantamount to\r\nextreme individualism. He conceived a democratic society to be composed\r\nof a collection of individuals, fundamentally alike in their abilities\r\nand deserts; and in organizing such a society, politically, the prime\r\nobject was to provide for the greatest satisfaction of its individual\r\nmembers. The good things of life which had formerly been monopolized by\r\nthe privileged few, were now to be distributed among all the people. It\r\nwas unnecessary, moreover, to make any very artful arrangements, in\r\norder to effect an equitable distribution. Such distribution would take\r\ncare of itself, provided nobody enjoyed any special privileges and\r\neverybody had equal opportunities. Once these conditions were secured,\r\nthe motto of a democratic government should simply be \"Hands Off.\" There\r\nshould be as little government as possible, because persistent\r\ngovernmental interference implied distrust in popular efficiency and\r\ngood-will; and what government there was, should be so far as possible\r\nconfided to local authorities. The vitality of a democracy resided in\r\nits extremities, and it would be diminished rather than increased by\r\nspecialized or centralized guidance. Its individual members needed\r\nmerely to be protected against privileges and to be let alone,\r\nwhereafter the native goodness of human nature would accomplish the\r\nperfect consummation.\r\n\r\nThus Jefferson sought an essentially equalitarian and even socialistic\r\nresult by means of an essentially individualistic machinery. His theory\r\nimplied a complete harmony both in logic and in effect between the idea\r\nof liberty and the idea of equality; and just in so far as there is any\r\nantagonism between those ideas, his whole political system becomes\r\nunsound and impracticable. Neither is there any doubt as to which of\r\nthese ideas Jefferson and his followers really attached the more\r\nimportance. Their mouths have always been full of the praise of liberty;\r\nand unquestionably they have really believed it to be the corner-stone\r\nof their political and social structure. None the less, however, is it\r\ntrue that in so far as any antagonism has developed in American life\r\nbetween liberty and equality, the Jeffersonian Democrats have been found\r\non the side of equality. Representing as they did the democratic\r\nprinciple, it is perfectly natural and desirable that they should fight\r\nthe battle of equality in a democratic state; and their error has been,\r\nnot their devotion to equality, but their inability to discern wherein\r\nany antagonism existed between liberty and equality, and the extent to\r\nwhich they were sacrificing a desirable liberty to an undesirable\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nOn this, as on so many other points, Hamilton's political philosophy was\r\nmuch more clearly thought out than that of Jefferson. He has been\r\naccused by his opponents of being the enemy of liberty; whereas in point\r\nof fact, he wished, like the Englishman he was, to protect and encourage\r\nliberty, just as far as such encouragement was compatible with good\r\norder, because he realized that genuine liberty would inevitably issue\r\nin fruitful social and economic inequalities. But he also realized that\r\ngenuine liberty was not merely a matter of a constitutional declaration\r\nof rights. It could be protected only by an energetic and clear-sighted\r\ncentral government, and it could be fertilized only by the efficient\r\nnational organization of American activities. For national organization\r\ndemands in relation to individuals a certain amount of selection, and a\r\ncertain classification of these individuals according to their abilities\r\nand deserts. It is just this kind or effect of liberty which Jefferson\r\nand his followers have always disliked and discouraged. They have been\r\nloud in their praise of legally constituted rights; but they have shown\r\nan instinctive and an implacable distrust of intellectual and moral\r\nindependence, and have always sought to suppress it in favor of\r\nintellectual and moral conformity. They have, that is, stood for the\r\nsacrifice of liberty--in so far as liberty meant positive intellectual\r\nand moral achievement--to a certain kind of equality.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to imply by the preceding statement that either Jefferson\r\nor his followers were the conscious enemies of moral and intellectual\r\nachievement. On the contrary, they appeared to themselves in their\r\namiable credulity to be the friends and guardians of everything\r\nadmirable in human life; but their good intentions did not prevent them\r\nfrom actively or passively opposing positive intellectual and moral\r\nachievement, directed either towards social or individual ends. The\r\neffect of their whole state of mind was negative and fatalistic. They\r\napproved in general of everything approvable; but the things of which\r\nthey actively approved were the things which everybody in general was\r\ndoing. Their point of view implied that society and individuals could be\r\nmade better without actually planning the improvement or building up an\r\norganization for the purpose; and this assertion brings me to the\r\ndeepest-lying difference between Hamilton and Jefferson. Jefferson's\r\npolicy was at bottom the old fatal policy of drift, whose distorted body\r\nwas concealed by fair-seeming clothes, and whose ugly face was covered\r\nby a mask of good intentions. Hamilton's policy was one of energetic and\r\nintelligent assertion of the national good. He knew that the only method\r\nwhereby the good could prevail either in individual or social life was\r\nby persistently willing that it should prevail and by the adoption of\r\nintelligent means to that end. His vision of the national good was\r\nlimited; but he was absolutely right about the way in which it was to be\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nHamilton was not afraid to exhibit in his own life moral and\r\nintellectual independence. He was not afraid to incur unpopularity for\r\npursuing what he believed to be a wise public policy, and the general\r\ndisapprobation under which he suffered during the last years of his\r\nlife, while it was chiefly due, as we have seen, to his distrust of the\r\nAmerican democracy, was also partly due to his high conception of the\r\nduties of leadership. Jefferson, on the other hand, afforded an equally\r\nimpressive example of the statesman who assiduously and intentionally\r\ncourted popular favor. It was, of course, easy for him to court popular\r\nfavor, because he understood the American people extremely well and\r\nreally sympathized with them; but he never used the influence which he\r\nthereby obtained for the realization of any positive or formative\r\npurpose, which might be unpopular. His policy, while in office, was one\r\nof fine phrases and temporary expedients, some of which necessarily\r\nincurred odium, but none of which were pursued by him or his followers\r\nwith any persistence. Whatever the people demanded, their leaders should\r\nperform, including, if necessary, a declaration of war against England.\r\nIt was to be a government of and by the people, not a government for the\r\npeople by popular but responsible leaders; and the leaders to whom the\r\npeople delegated their authority had in theory no right to pursue an\r\nunpopular policy. The people were to guide their leaders, not their\r\nleaders the people; and any intellectual or moral independence and\r\ninitiative on the part of the leaders in a democracy was to be condemned\r\nas undemocratic. The representatives of a Sovereign people were in the\r\nsame position as the courtiers of an absolute monarch. It was their\r\nbusiness to flatter and obey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFEDERALISM AND REPUBLICANISM AS ALLIES\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, consequently, that Jefferson, who had been a lion\r\nin opposition, was transformed by the assumption of power into a lamb.\r\nInasmuch as he had been denouncing every act of the Federalists since\r\nthe consummation of the Union as dangerous to American liberties or as\r\ninimical to the public welfare, it was to be anticipated, when he and\r\nhis party assumed office, that they would seek both to tear down the\r\nFederalist structure and rear in its place a temple of the true\r\nRepublican faith. Not only did nothing of the kind follow, but nothing\r\nof the kind was even attempted. Considering the fulminations of the\r\nRepublicans during the last ten years of Federalist domination,\r\nJefferson's first Inaugural is a bewildering document. The recent past,\r\nwhich had but lately been so full of dangers, was ignored; and the\r\nfuture, the dangers of which were much more real, was not for the moment\r\nconsidered. Jefferson was sworn in with his head encircled by a halo of\r\nbeautiful phrases; and he and his followers were so well satisfied with\r\nthis beatific vision that they entirely overlooked the desirability of\r\nredeeming their own past or of providing for their country's future.\r\nSufficient unto the day was the popularity thereof. The Federalists\r\nthemselves must be conciliated, and the national organization achieved\r\nby them is by implication accepted. The Federalist structure, so\r\nrecently the prison of the free American spirit, becomes itself a large\r\npart of the temple of democracy. The Union is no longer inimical to\r\nliberty. For the first time we begin to hear from good Republican\r\nmouths, some sacred words about the necessary connection of liberty and\r\nunion. Jefferson celebrated his triumph by adopting the work, if not the\r\ncreed, of his adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe adoption by Jefferson and the Republicans of the political structure\r\nof their opponents is of an importance hardly inferior to that of the\r\nadoption of the Constitution by the states. It was the first practical\r\nindication that democracy and Federalism were not as radically\r\nantagonistic as their extreme partisans had believed; and it was also\r\nthe first indication that the interests which were concealed behind the\r\nphrases of the two parties were not irreconcilable. When the democracy\r\nrallied to the national organization, the American state began to be a\r\ndemocratic nation. The alliance was as yet both fragile and superficial.\r\nIt was founded on a sacrifice by the two parties, not merely of certain\r\nerrors and misconceptions, but also of certain convictions, which had\r\nbeen considered essential. The Republicans tacitly admitted the\r\nsubstantial falsity of their attacks upon the Federal organization. The\r\nmany Federalists who joined their opponents abandoned without scruple\r\nthe whole spirit and purpose of the Hamiltonian national policy. But at\r\nany rate the reconciliation was accomplished. The newly founded American\r\nstate was for the time being saved from the danger of being torn asunder\r\nby two rival factions, each representing irreconcilable ideas and\r\ninterests. The Union, which had been celebrated in 1789, was consummated\r\nin 1801. Its fertility was still to be proved.\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson and the Republicans rallied to the Union and to the\r\nexisting Federalist organization, the fabric of traditional American\r\ndemocracy was almost completely woven. Thereafter the American people\r\nhad only to wear it and keep it in repair. The policy announced in\r\nJefferson's first Inaugural was in all important respects merely a\r\npolicy of conservatism. The American people were possessed of a set of\r\npolitical institutions, which deprived them of any legitimate grievances\r\nand supplied them with every reasonable opportunity; and their political\r\nduty was confined to the administration of these institutions in a\r\nfaithful spirit and their preservation from harm. The future contained\r\nonly one serious danger. Such liberties were always open to attack, and\r\nthere would always be designing men whose interest it was to attack\r\nthem. The great political responsibility of the American democracy was\r\nto guard itself against such assaults; and should they succeed in this\r\ntask they need have no further concern about their future. Their\r\npolitical salvation was secure. They had placed it, as it were, in a\r\ngood sound bank. It would be sure to draw interest provided the bank\r\nwere conservatively managed--that is, provided it were managed by loyal\r\nRepublicans. There was no room or need for any increase in the fund,\r\nbecause it already satisfied every reasonable purpose. But it must not\r\nbe diminished; and it must not be exposed to any risk of diminution by\r\nhazardous speculative investments.\r\n\r\nDuring the next fifty years, the American democracy accepted almost\r\nliterally this Jeffersonian tradition. Until the question of slavery\r\nbecame acute, they ceased to think seriously about political problems.\r\nThe lawyers were preoccupied with certain important questions of\r\nconstitutional interpretation, which had their political implications;\r\nbut the purpose of these expositions of our fundamental law was the\r\naffirmation, the consolidation, and towards the end, the partial\r\nrestriction of the existing Federalist organization. In this as in other\r\nrespects the Americans of the second and third generations were merely\r\npreserving what their fathers had wrought. Their political institutions\r\nwere good, in so far as they were not disturbed. They might become bad,\r\nonly in case they were perverted. The way to guard against such\r\nperversion was, of course, to secure the election of righteous\r\ndemocrats. From the traditional American point of view, it was far more\r\nimportant to get the safe candidates elected than it was to use the\r\npower so obtained for any useful political achievement. In the hands of\r\nunsafe men,--that is, one's political opponents,--the government might\r\nbe perverted to dangerous uses, whereas in the hands of safe men, it\r\ncould at best merely be preserved in safety. Misgovernment was a\r\ngreater danger than good government was a benefit, because good\r\ngovernment, particularly on the part of Federal officials, consisted,\r\napart from routine business, in letting things alone. Thus the furious\r\ninterest, which the good American took in getting himself and his\r\nassociates elected, could be justified by reasons founded on the\r\nessential nature of the traditional political system.\r\n\r\nThe good American democrat had, of course, another political duty\r\nbesides that of securing the election of himself and his friends. His\r\npolitical system was designed, not merely to deprive him of grievances,\r\nbut to offer him superlative opportunities. In taking the utmost\r\nadvantage of those opportunities, he was not only fulfilling his duty to\r\nhimself, but he was helping to realize the substantial purpose of\r\ndemocracy. Just as it was the function of the national organization to\r\nkeep itself undefiled and not to interfere, so it was his personal\r\nfunction to make hay while the sun was shining. The triumph of Jefferson\r\nand the defeat of Hamilton enabled the natural individualism of the\r\nAmerican people free play. The democratic political system was\r\nconsidered tantamount in practice to a species of vigorous, licensed,\r\nand purified selfishness. The responsibilities of the government were\r\nnegative; those of the individual were positive. And it is no wonder\r\nthat in the course of time his positive responsibilities began to look\r\nlarger and larger. This licensed selfishness became more domineering in\r\nproportion as it became more successful. If a political question arose,\r\nwhich in any way interfered with his opportunities, the good American\r\nbegan to believe that his democratic political machine was out of gear.\r\nDid Abolitionism create a condition of political unrest, and interfere\r\nwith good business, then Abolitionists were wicked men, who were\r\ntampering with the ark of the Constitution; and in much the same way the\r\nmodern reformer, who proposes policies looking toward a restriction in\r\nthe activity of corporations and stands in the way of the immediate\r\ntransaction of the largest possible volume of business, is denounced as\r\nun-American. These were merely crude ways of expressing the spirit of\r\ntraditional American democracy,--which was that of a rampant\r\nindividualism, checked only by a system of legally constituted rights.\r\nThe test of American national success was the comfort and prosperity of\r\nthe individual; and the means to that end,--a system of unrestricted\r\nindividual aggrandizement and collective irresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe alliance between Federalism and democracy on which this traditional\r\nsystem was based, was excellent in many of its effects; but\r\nunfortunately it implied on the part of both the allies a sacrifice of\r\npolitical sincerity and conviction. And this sacrifice was more\r\ndemoralizing to the Republicans than to the Federalists, because they\r\nwere the victorious party. A central government, constructed on the\r\nbasis of their democratic creed, would have been a government whose\r\npowers were smaller, more rigid, and more inefficiently distributed than\r\nthose granted under our Federal Constitution--as may be seen from the\r\nvarious state constitutions subsequently written under Jeffersonian\r\ninfluence. When they obtained power either they should have been\r\nfaithful to their convictions and tried to modify the Federal machinery\r\nin accordance therewith, or they should have modified their ideas in\r\norder to make them square with their behavior. But instead of seriously\r\nand candidly considering the meaning of their own actions, they opened\r\ntheir mouths wide enough to swallow their own past and then deliberately\r\nshut their eyes. They accepted the national organization as a fact and\r\nas a condition of national safety; but they rejected it as a lesson in\r\npolitical wisdom, and as an implicit principle of political action. By\r\nso doing they began that career of intellectual lethargy,\r\nsuperficiality, and insincerity which ever since has been characteristic\r\nof official American political thought.\r\n\r\nThis lack of intellectual integrity on the part of the American\r\ndemocracy both falsified the spirit in which our institutions had\r\noriginated, and seriously compromised their future success. The Union\r\nhad been wrought by virtue of vigorous, responsible, and enterprising\r\nleadership, and of sound and consistent political thinking. It was to be\r\nperpetuated by a company of men, who disbelieved in enterprising and\r\nresponsible leadership, and who had abandoned and tended to disparage\r\nanything but the most routine political ideas. The American people,\r\nafter passing through a period of positive achievement, distinguished in\r\nall history for the powerful application of brains to the solution of an\r\norganic political problem--the American people, after this almost\r\nunprecedented exhibition of good-will and good judgment, proceeded to\r\nput a wholly false interpretation on their remarkable triumph. They\r\nproceeded, also, to cultivate a state of mind which has kept them\r\npeculiarly liable to intellectual ineptitude and conformity. The mixture\r\nof optimism, conservatism, and superficiality, which has until recently\r\ncharacterized their political point of view, has made them almost blind\r\nto the true lessons of their own national experience.\r\n\r\nThe best that can be said on behalf of this traditional American system\r\nof political ideas is that it contained the germ of better things. The\r\ncombination of Federalism and Republicanism which formed the substance\r\nof the system, did not constitute a progressive and formative political\r\nprinciple, but it pointed in the direction of a constructive formula.\r\nThe political leaders of the \"era of good feeling\" who began to use with\r\nsome degree of conviction certain comely phrases about the eternal and\r\ninseparable alliance between \"liberty and union\" were looking towards\r\nthe promised land of American democratic fulfillment. As we shall see,\r\nthe kind of liberty and the kind of union which they had in mind were by\r\nno means indissolubly and inseparably united; and both of these words\r\nhad to be transformed from a negative and legal into a positive moral\r\nand social meaning before the boasted alliance could be anything but\r\nprecarious and sterile. But if for liberty we substitute the word\r\ndemocracy, which means something more than liberty, and if for union, we\r\nsubstitute the phrase American nationality, which means so much more\r\nthan a legal union, we shall be looking in the direction of a fruitful\r\nalliance between two supplementary principles. It can, I believe, be\r\nstated without qualification that wherever the nationalist idea and\r\ntendency has been divided from democracy, its achievements have been\r\nlimited and partially sterilized. It can also be stated that the\r\nseparation of the democratic idea from the national principle and\r\norganization has issued not merely in sterility, but in moral and\r\npolitical mischief. All this must remain mere assertion for the present;\r\nbut I shall hope gradually to justify these assertions by an examination\r\nof the subsequent course of American political development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATS AND THE WHIGS\r\n\r\nThe first phase of American political history was characterized by the\r\nconflict between the Federalists and the Republicans, and it resulted in\r\nthe complete triumph of the latter. The second period was characterized\r\nby an almost equally bitter contest between the Democrats and the Whigs\r\nin which the Democrats represented a new version of the earlier\r\nRepublican tradition and the Whigs a resurrected Federalism. The\r\nDemocracy of Jackson differed in many important respects from the\r\nRepublicanism of Jefferson, and the Whig doctrine of Henry Clay was far\r\nremoved from the Federalism of Alexander Hamilton. Nevertheless, from\r\n1825 to 1850, the most important fact in American political development\r\ncontinued to be a fight between an inadequate conception of democracy,\r\nrepresented by Jackson and his followers, and a feeble conception of\r\nAmerican nationality, represented best by Henry Clay and Daniel Webster;\r\nand in this second fight the victory still rested, on the whole, with\r\nthe Democrats. The Whigs were not annihilated as the Federalists had\r\nbeen. In the end they perished as a party, but not because of the\r\nassaults of their opponents, but because of their impotence in the face\r\nof a grave national crisis. Nevertheless, they were on all essential\r\nissues beaten by the Democrats; and on the few occasions on which they\r\nwere victorious, their victories were both meaningless and fruitless.\r\n\r\nThe years between 1800 and 1825 were distinguished, so far as our\r\ndomestic development was concerned, by the growth of the Western pioneer\r\nDemocracy in power and self-consciousness. It was one of the gravest\r\nerrors of Hamilton and the Federalists that they misunderstood and\r\nsuspected the pioneer Democracy, just as it was one of the greatest\r\nmerits of Jefferson that he early appreciated its importance and used\r\nhis influence and power to advance its interests. The consequence was\r\nthat the pioneers became enthusiastic and radical supporters of the\r\nRepublican party. They repeated and celebrated the Jeffersonian\r\ncatchwords with the utmost conviction. They became imbued with the\r\nspirit of the true Jeffersonian faith. They were, indeed, in many\r\nrespects more Jeffersonian than Jefferson himself, and sought to realize\r\nsome of his ideas with more energy and consistency. These ideas\r\nexpressed and served their practical needs marvelously well, and if the\r\nformulas had not already been provided by Jefferson, they would most\r\nassuredly have been crystallized by the pioneer politicians of the day.\r\nThe Jeffersonian creed has exercised a profound influence upon the\r\nthought of the American people, not because Jefferson was an original\r\nand profound thinker, but because of his ability to formulate popular\r\nopinions, prejudices, and interests.\r\n\r\nIt is none the less true that the pioneer Democracy soon came to differ\r\nwith Jefferson about some important questions of public policy. They\r\nearly showed, for instance, a lively disapproval of Jefferson's\r\nmanagement of the crisis in foreign affairs, which preceded the War of\r\n1812. Jefferson's policy of commercial embargo seemed pusillanimous to\r\nJackson and the other Western Democrats. They did not believe in\r\npeaceful warfare; and their different conception of the effective way of\r\nfighting a foreign enemy was symptomatic of a profound difference of\r\nopinion and temper. The Western Democracy did not share Jefferson's\r\namiable cosmopolitanism. It was, on the contrary, aggressively resolved\r\nto assert the rights and the interests of the United States against any\r\nsuspicion of European aggrandizement. However much it preferred a\r\nlet-alone policy in respect to the domestic affairs, all its instincts\r\nrevolted against a weak foreign policy; and its instincts were outraged\r\nby the administration's policy of peaceful warfare, which injured\r\nourselves so much more than it injured England, not only because the\r\npioneers were fighting men by conviction and habit, but because they\r\nwere much more genuinely national in their feelings than were Jefferson\r\nand Madison.\r\n\r\nThe Western Democrats finally forced Madison and the official Republican\r\nleaders to declare war against England, because Madison preferred even a\r\nforeign war to the loss of popularity; but Madison, although he accepted\r\nthe necessity of war, was wholly incompetent to conduct it efficiently.\r\nThe inadequacy of our national organization and our lack of national\r\ncohesion was immediately and painfully exhibited. The Republican\r\nsuperstition about militarism had prevented the formation of a regular\r\narmy at all adequate to the demands of our national policy, and the\r\nAmerican navy, while efficient so far as it went, was very much too\r\nsmall to constitute an effective engine of naval warfare. Moreover, the\r\nvery Congress that clearly announced an intention of declaring war on\r\nGreat Britain failed to make any sufficient provision for its energetic\r\nprosecution. The consequence of this short-sighted view of our national\r\nresponsibilities is that the history of the War of 1812 makes painful\r\nreading for a patriotic American. The little American navy earned\r\ndistinction, but it was so small that its successes did not prevent it\r\nfrom being shut off eventually from the high seas. The military\r\noperations were a succession of blunders both in strategy and in\r\nperformance. On the northern frontier a series of incompetent generals\r\nled little armies of half-hearted soldiers to unnecessary defeats or at\r\nbest to ineffectual victories; and the most conspicuous military success\r\nwas won at New Orleans by the Western pioneers, who had no\r\nconstitutional scruples about fighting outside of their own states, and\r\nwho were animated by lively patriotic feelings. On the whole, however,\r\nthe story makes humiliating reading, not because the national Capital\r\nwas captured almost without resistance, or because we were so frequently\r\nbeaten, but because our disorganization, the incompetence of the\r\nnational government, and the disloyalty of so many Americans made us\r\ndeserve both a less successful war and a more humiliating peace.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of the second English war for the purpose of this\r\nbook is, however, its clear indication of the abiding-place at that time\r\nof the American national spirit. That spirit was not found along the\r\nAtlantic coast, whose inhabitants were embittered and blinded by party\r\nand sectional prejudices. It was resident in the newer states of the\r\nWest and the Southwest. A genuine American national democracy was coming\r\ninto existence in that part of the country--a democracy which was as\r\ndemocratic as it knew how to be, while at the same time loyal and\r\ndevoted to the national government. The pioneers had in a measure\r\noutgrown the colonialism of the thirteen original commonwealths. They\r\noccupied a territory which had in the beginning been part of the\r\nnational domain. Their local commonwealths had not antedated the\r\nFederal Union, but were in a way children of the central government; and\r\nthey felt that they belonged to the Union in a way that was rarely\r\nshared by an inhabitant of Massachusetts or South Carolina. Their\r\nnational feeling did not prevent them from being in some respects\r\nextremely local and provincial in their point of view. It did not\r\nprevent them from resenting with the utmost energy any interference of\r\nthe Federal government in what they believed to be their local affairs.\r\nBut they were none the less, first and foremost, loyal citizens of the\r\nAmerican Federal state.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW NATIONAL DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nWe must consider carefully this earliest combination of the national\r\nwith the democratic idea. The Western Democracy is important, not only\r\nbecause it played the leading part in our political history down to\r\n1850, but precisely because it does offer, in a primitive but\r\nsignificant form, a combination of the two ideas, which, when united,\r\nconstitute the formative principle in American political and social\r\ndevelopment. The way had been prepared for this combination by the\r\nRepublican acceptance of the Federal organization, after that party had\r\nassumed power; but the Western Democrats took this alliance much more\r\ninnocently than the older Republican leaders. They insisted, as we have\r\nseen, on a declaration of war against Great Britain; and humiliating as\r\nwere the results of that war, this vigorous assertion of the national\r\npoint of view, both exposed in clear relief the sectional disloyalty of\r\nthe Federalists of New England and resulted later in an attempted\r\nrevival of a national constructive policy. It is true that the\r\nregeneration of the Hamiltonian spirit belongs rather to the history of\r\nthe Whigs than to the history of the Democrats. It is true, also, that\r\nthe attempted revival at once brought out the inadequacy of the\r\npioneer's conceptions both of the national and the democratic ideas.\r\nNevertheless, it was their assertion of the national interest against a\r\nforeign enemy which provoked its renewed vitality in relation to our\r\ndomestic affairs. Whatever the alliance between nationality and\r\ndemocracy, represented by the pioneers, lacked in fruitful understanding\r\nof the correlative ideas, at least it was solid alliance. The Western\r\nDemocrats were suspicious of any increase of the national organization\r\nin power and scope, but they were even more determined that it should be\r\nneither shattered nor vitally injured. Although they were unable to\r\ngrasp the meaning of their own convictions, the Federal Union really\r\nmeant to them something more than an indissoluble legal contract. It was\r\nrooted in their life. It was one of those things for which they were\r\nwilling to fight; and their readiness to fight for the national idea was\r\nthe great salutary fact. Our country was thereby saved from the\r\nconsequences of its distracting individualistic conception of democracy,\r\nand its merely legal conception of nationality. It was because the\r\nfollowers of Jackson and Douglas did fight for it, that the Union was\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nBe it immediately remarked, however, that the pioneer Democrats were\r\nobliged to fight for the Union, just because they were not interested in\r\nits progressive consummation. They willed at one and the same time that\r\nthe Union _should_ be preserved, but that it _should not_ be increased\r\nand strengthened. They were national in feeling, but local and\r\nindividualistic in their ideas; and these limited ideas were associated\r\nwith a false and inadequate conception of democracy. Jefferson had\r\ntaught them to believe that any increase of the national organization\r\nwas inimical to democracy. The limitations of their own economic and\r\nsocial experience and of their practical needs confirmed them in this\r\nbelief. Their manner of life made them at once thoroughly loyal and\r\nextremely insubordinate. They combined the sincerest patriotism with an\r\nenergetic and selfish individualism; and they failed wholly to realize\r\nany discrepancy between these two dominant elements in their life. They\r\nwere to love their country, but they were to work for themselves; and\r\nnothing wrong could happen to their country, provided they preserved its\r\ninstitutions and continued to enjoy its opportunities. Their failure to\r\ngrasp the idea that the Federal Union would not take care of itself,\r\nprevented them from taking disunionist ideas seriously, and encouraged\r\nthem to provoke a crisis, which, subsequently, their fundamental loyalty\r\nto the Union prevented from becoming disastrous. They expected their\r\ncountry to drift to a safe harbor in the Promised Land, whereas the\r\ninexorable end of a drifting ship is either the rocks or the shoals.\r\n\r\nIn their opposition to the consolidation of the national organization,\r\nthe pioneers believed that they were defending the citadel of their\r\ndemocratic creed. Democracy meant to them, not only equal opportunities\r\nsecured by law, but an approximately equal standing among individual\r\ncitizens, and an approximately equal division of the social and economic\r\nfruits. They realized vaguely that national consolidation brought with\r\nit organization, and organization depended for its efficiency upon a\r\nclassification of individual citizens according to ability, knowledge,\r\nand competence. In a nationalized state, it is the man of exceptional\r\nposition, power, responsibility, and training who is most likely to be\r\nrepresentative and efficient, whereas in a thoroughly democratic state,\r\nas they conceived it, the average man was the representative citizen and\r\nthe fruitful type. Nationalization looked towards the introduction and\r\nperpetuation of a political, social, and financial hierarchy. They\r\nopposed it consequently, on behalf of the \"plain people\"; and they even\r\nreached the conclusion that the contemporary political system was to\r\nsome extent organized for the benefit of special interests. They\r\ndiscovered in the fiscal and administrative organization the presence of\r\ndiscrimination against the average man. The National Bank was an example\r\nof special economic privileges. The office-holding clique was an example\r\nof special political privileges. Jackson and his followers declared war\r\non these sacrilegious anomalies in the temple of democracy. Thus the\r\nonly innovations which the pioneers sought to impose on our national\r\npolitical system were by way of being destructive. They uprooted a\r\nnational institution which had existed, with but one brief interruption,\r\nfor more than forty years; and they entirely altered the tradition of\r\nappointment in the American civil service. Both of these destructive\r\nachievements throw a great deal of light upon their unconscious\r\ntendencies and upon their explicit convictions, and will help us to\r\nunderstand the value and the limitation of the positive contribution\r\nwhich the pioneers made to the fullness of the American democratic idea.\r\n\r\nThe National Bank was the institution by virtue of which Hamilton sought\r\nto secure a stable national currency and an efficient national fiscal\r\nagent; and the Bank, particularly under its second charter, had\r\nundoubtedly been a useful and economical piece of financial machinery.\r\nThe Republicans had protested against it in the beginning, but they had\r\nlater come to believe in its necessity; and at the time Benton and\r\nJackson declared war upon it, the Bank was, on the whole, and in spite\r\nof certain minor and local grievances, a popular institution. If the\r\nquestion of the re-charter of the National Bank had been submitted to\r\npopular vote in 1832, a popular majority would probably have declared in\r\nits favor. Jackson's victory was due partly to his personal popularity,\r\npartly to the unwise manner in which the Bank was defended, but chiefly\r\nto his success in convincing public opinion that the Bank was an\r\ninstitution whose legal privileges were used to the detriment of the\r\nAmerican people. As a matter of fact, such was not the case. The Bank\r\nwas a semi-public corporation, upon which certain exceptional privileges\r\nhad been conferred, because the enjoyment of such privileges was\r\ninseparable from the services it performed and the responsibilities it\r\nassumed. When we consider how important those services were, and how\r\ndifficult it has since been to substitute any arrangement, which\r\nprovides as well both a flexible and a stable currency and for the\r\narticulation of the financial operations of the Federal Treasury with\r\nthose of the business of the country, it does not look as if the\r\nemoluments and privileges of the Bank were disproportionate to its\r\nservices. But Jackson and his followers never even considered whether\r\nits services and responsibilities were proportionate to its legal\r\nprivileges. The fact that any such privilege existed, the fact that any\r\nlegal association of individuals should enjoy such exceptional\r\nopportunities, was to their minds a violation of democratic principles.\r\nIt must consequently be destroyed, no matter how much the country needed\r\nits services, and no matter how difficult it was to establish in its\r\nplace any equally efficient institution.\r\n\r\nThe important point is, however, that the campaign against the National\r\nBank uncovered a latent socialism, which lay concealed behind the\r\nrampant individualism of the pioneer Democracy. The ostensible grievance\r\nagainst the Bank was the possession by a semi-public corporation of\r\nspecial economic privileges; but the anti-Bank literature of the time\r\nwas filled half unconsciously with a far more fundamental complaint.\r\nWhat the Western Democrats disliked and feared most of all was the\r\npossession of any special power by men of wealth. Their crusade against\r\nthe \"Money Power\" meant that in their opinion money must not become a\r\npower in a democratic state. They had no objection, of course, to\r\ncertain inequalities in the distribution of wealth; but they fiercely\r\nresented the idea that such inequalities should give a group of men any\r\nspecial advantages which were inaccessible to their fellow-countrymen.\r\nThe full meaning of their complaint against the Bank was left vague and\r\nambiguous, because the Bank itself possessed special legal privileges;\r\nand the inference was that when these privileges were withdrawn, the\r\n\"Money Power\" would disappear with them. The Western Democrat devoutly\r\nbelieved that an approximately equal division of the good things of life\r\nwould result from the possession by all American citizens of equal legal\r\nrights and similar economic opportunities. But the importance of this\r\nresult in their whole point of view was concealed by the fact that they\r\nexpected to reach it by wholly negative means--that is, by leaving the\r\nindividual alone. The substantially equal distribution of wealth, which\r\nwas characteristic of the American society of their own day, was far\r\nmore fundamental in their system of political and social ideas than was\r\nthe machinery of liberty whereby it was to be secured. And just as soon\r\nas it becomes apparent that the proposed machinery does as a matter of\r\nfact accomplish a radically unequal result, their whole political and\r\neconomic creed cries loudly for revision.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the spoils system was due to the perverted\r\napplication of kindred ideas. The emoluments of office loomed large\r\namong the good things of life to the pioneer Democrat; and such\r\nemoluments differed from other economic rewards, in that they were\r\nnecessarily at the disposal of the political organization. The public\r\noffices constituted the tangible political patrimony of the American\r\npeople. It was not enough that they were open to everybody. They must\r\nactually be shared by almost everybody. The terms of all elected\r\nofficials must be short, so that as many good democrats as possible\r\ncould occupy an easy chair in the house of government; and officials\r\nmust for similar reasons be appointed for only short terms. Traditional\r\npractice at Washington disregarded these obvious inferences from the\r\nprinciples of true democracy. Until the beginning of Jackson's first\r\nadministration the offices in the government departments had been\r\nappropriated by a few bureaucrats who had grown old at their posts; and\r\nhow could such a permanent appropriation be justified? The pioneer\r\nDemocrat believed that he was as competent to do the work as any member\r\nof an office-holding clique, so that when he came into power, he\r\ncorrected what seemed to him to be a genuine abuse in the traditional\r\nway of distributing the American political patrimony. He could not\r\nunderstand that training, special ability, or long experience\r\nconstituted any special claim upon a public office, or upon any other\r\nparticular opportunity or salary. One democrat was as good as another,\r\nand deserved his share of the rewards of public service. The state could\r\nnot undertake to secure a good living to all good democrats, but, when\r\nproperly administered, it could prevent any appropriation by a few\r\npeople of the public pay-roll.\r\n\r\nIn the long run the effect of the spoils system was, of course, just the\r\nopposite of that anticipated by the early Jacksonian Democrats. It\r\nmerely substituted one kind of office-holding privilege for another. It\r\nhelped to build up a group of professional politicians who became in\r\ntheir turn an office-holding clique--the only difference being that one\r\nman in his political life held, not one, but many offices. Yet the\r\nJacksonian Democrat undoubtedly believed, when he introduced the system\r\ninto the Federal civil service, that he was carrying out a desirable\r\nreform along strictly democratic lines. He was betrayed into such an\r\nerror by the narrowness of his own experience and of his intellectual\r\noutlook. His experience had been chiefly that of frontier life, in which\r\nthe utmost freedom of economic and social movement was necessary; and he\r\nattempted to apply the results of this limited experience to the\r\ngovernment of a complicated social organism whose different parts had\r\nvery different needs. The direct results of the attempt were very\r\nmischievous. He fastened upon the American public service a system of\r\nappointment which turned political office into the reward of partisan\r\nservice, which made it unnecessary for the public officials to be\r\ncompetent and impossible for them to be properly experienced, and which\r\ncontributed finally to the creation of a class of office-holding\r\npoliticians. But the introduction of the spoils system had a meaning\r\nsuperior to its results. It was, after all, an attempt to realize an\r\nideal, and the ideal was based on a genuine experience. The \"Virginian\r\nOligarchy,\" although it was the work of Jefferson and his followers, was\r\nan anachronism in a state governed in the spirit of Jeffersonian\r\nDemocratic principles. It was better for the Jacksonian Democrats to\r\nsacrifice what they believed to be an obnoxious precedent to their\r\nprinciples than to sacrifice their principles to mere precedent. If in\r\nso doing they were making a mistake, that was because their principles\r\nwere wrong. The benefit which they were temporarily conferring on\r\nthemselves, as a class in the community, was sanctioned by the letter\r\nand the spirit of their creed.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with their perverted ideas and their narrow view of\r\nlife, we may discern a leaven of new and useful democratic experience.\r\nThe new and useful experience which they contributed to our national\r\nstock was that of homogeneous social intercourse. I have already\r\nremarked that the Western pioneers were the first large body of\r\nAmericans who were genuinely national in feeling. They were also the\r\nfirst large body of Americans who were genuinely democratic in feeling.\r\nConsequently they imparted a certain emotional consistency to the\r\nAmerican democracy, and they thereby performed a social service which\r\nwas in its way quite as valuable as their political service. Democracy\r\nhas always been stronger as a political than it has as a social force.\r\nWhen adopted as a political ideal of the American people, it was very\r\nfar from possessing any effective social vitality; and until the present\r\nday it has been a much more active force in political than in social\r\nlife. But whatever traditional social force it has obtained, can be\r\ntraced directly to the Western pioneer Democrat. His democracy was based\r\non genuine good-fellowship. Unlike the French Fraternity, it was the\r\nproduct neither of abstract theories nor of a disembodied\r\nhumanitarianism. It was the natural issue of their interests, their\r\noccupations, and their manner of life. They felt kindly towards one\r\nanother and communicated freely with one another because they were not\r\ndivided by radical differences in class, standards, point of view, and\r\nwealth. The social aspect of their democracy may, in fact, be compared\r\nto the sense of good-fellowship which pervades the rooms of a properly\r\nconstituted club.\r\n\r\nTheir community of feeling and their ease of communication had come\r\nabout as the result of pioneer life in a self-governing community. The\r\nWestern Americans were confronted by a gigantic task of overwhelming\r\npractical importance,--the task of subduing to the needs of complicated\r\nand civilized society a rich but virgin wilderness. This task was one\r\nwhich united a desirable social purpose with a profitable individual\r\ninterest. The country was undeveloped, and its inhabitants were poor.\r\nThey were to enrich themselves by the development of the country, and\r\nthe two different aspects of their task were scarcely distinguished.\r\nThey felt themselves authorized by social necessity to pursue their own\r\ninterests energetically and unscrupulously, and they were not either\r\nhampered or helped in so doing by the interference of the local or the\r\nnational authorities. While the only people the pioneer was obliged to\r\nconsult were his neighbors, all his surroundings tended to make his\r\nneighbors like himself--to bind them together by common interests,\r\nfeelings, and ideas. These surroundings called for practical, able,\r\nflexible, alert, energetic, and resolute men, and men of a different\r\ntype had no opportunity of coming to the surface. The successful pioneer\r\nDemocrat was not a pleasant type in many respects, but he was saved from\r\nmany of the worst aspects of his limited experience and ideas by a\r\ncertain innocence, generosity, and kindliness of spirit. With all his\r\nwillful aggressiveness he was a companionable person who meant much\r\nbetter towards his fellows than he himself knew.\r\n\r\nWe need to guard scrupulously against the under-valuation of the advance\r\nwhich the pioneers made towards a genuine social democracy. The freedom\r\nof intercourse and the consistency of feeling which they succeeded in\r\nattaining is an indispensable characteristic of a democratic society.\r\nThe unity of such a state must lie deeper than any bond established by\r\nobedience to a single political authority, or by the acceptance of\r\ncommon precedents and ideas. It must be based in some measure upon an\r\ninstinctive familiarity of association, upon a quick communicability of\r\nsympathy, upon the easy and effortless sense of companionship. Such\r\nfamiliar intercourse is impossible, not only in a society with\r\naristocratic institutions, but it can with difficulty be attained in a\r\nsociety that has once had aristocratic institutions. A century more or\r\nless of political democracy has not introduced it into France, and in\r\n1830 it did not exist along the Atlantic seaboard at all to the same\r\nextent that it did in the newer states of the West. In those states the\r\npeople, in a sense, really lived together. They were divided by fewer\r\nbarriers than have been any similarly numerous body of people in the\r\nhistory of the world; and it was this characteristic which made them so\r\nefficient and so easily directed by their natural leaders. No doubt it\r\nwould be neither possible nor desirable to reproduce a precisely similar\r\nconsistency of feeling over a social area in which there was a greater\r\ndiversity of manners, standards, and occupations; but it remains true\r\nthat the American democracy will lose its most valuable and promising\r\ncharacteristic in case it loses the homogeneity of feeling which the\r\npioneers were the first to embody.\r\n\r\nIt is equally important to remember, however, that the social\r\nconsistency of the pioneer communities should under different conditions\r\nundergo a radical transformation. Neither the pioneers themselves nor\r\ntheir admirers and their critics have sufficiently understood how much\r\nindividual independence was sacrificed in order to obtain this\r\nconsistency of feeling, or how completely it was the product, in the\r\nform it assumed, of temporary economic conditions. If we study the\r\nWestern Democrats as a body of men who, on the whole, responded\r\nadmirably to the conditions and opportunities of their time, but who\r\nwere also very much victimized and impoverished by the limited nature of\r\nthese conditions and opportunities--if we study the Western Democrat\r\nfrom that point of view, we shall find him to be the most significant\r\neconomic and social type in American history. On the other hand, if we\r\nregard him in the way that he and his subsequent prototypes wish to be\r\nregarded, as the example of all that is permanently excellent and\r\nformative in American democracy, he will be, not only entirely\r\nmisunderstood, but transformed from an edifying into a mischievous type.\r\n\r\nTheir peculiar social homogeneity, and their conviction that one man was\r\nas good as another, was the natural and legitimate product of\r\ncontemporary economic conditions. The average man, without any special\r\nbent or qualifications, was in the pioneer states the useful man. In\r\nthat country it was sheer waste to spend much energy upon tasks which\r\ndemanded skill, prolonged experience, high technical standards, or\r\nexclusive devotion. The cheaply and easily made instrument was the\r\nefficient instrument, because it was adapted to a year or two of use and\r\nthen for supersession by a better instrument; and for the service of\r\nsuch tools one man was as likely to be good as another. No special\r\nequipment was required. The farmer was obliged to be all kinds of a\r\nrough mechanic. The business man was merchant, manufacturer, and\r\nstorekeeper. Almost everybody was something of a politician. The number\r\nof parts which a man of energy played in his time was astonishingly\r\nlarge. Andrew Jackson was successively a lawyer, judge, planter,\r\nmerchant, general, politician, and statesman; and he played most of\r\nthese parts with conspicuous success. In such a society a man who\r\npersisted in one job, and who applied the most rigorous and exacting\r\nstandards to his work, was out of place and was really inefficient. His\r\nfinished product did not serve its temporary purpose much better than\r\ndid the current careless and hasty product, and his higher standards and\r\npeculiar ways constituted an implied criticism upon the easy methods of\r\nhis neighbors. He interfered with the rough good-fellowship which\r\nnaturally arises among a group of men who submit good-naturedly and\r\nuncritically to current standards.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, consequently, that the pioneer Democracy viewed with\r\ndistrust and aversion the man with a special vocation and high standards\r\nof achievement. Such a man did insist upon being in certain respects\r\nbetter than the average; and under the prevalent economic social\r\nconditions he did impair the consistency of feeling upon which the\r\npioneers rightly placed such a high value. Consequently they half\r\nunconsciously sought to suppress men with special vocations. For the\r\nmost part this suppression was easily accomplished by the action of\r\nordinary social and economic motives. All the industrial, political, and\r\nsocial rewards went to the man who pursued his business, professional,\r\nor political career along regular lines; and in this way an ordinary\r\ntask and an interested motive were often imposed on men who were better\r\nqualified for special tasks undertaken from disinterested motives. But\r\nit was not enough to suppress the man with a special vocation by\r\ndepriving him of social and pecuniary rewards. Public opinion must be\r\ntaught to approve of the average man as the representative type of the\r\nAmerican democracy, so that the man with a special vocation may be\r\ndeprived of any interest or share in the American democratic tradition;\r\nand this attempt to make the average man the representative American\r\ndemocrat has persisted to the present day--that is, to a time when the\r\naverage man is no longer, as in 1830, the dominant economic factor.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way, most unfortunately, that one of the leading articles\r\nin the American popular creed has tended to impair American moral and\r\nintellectual integrity. If the man with special standards and a special\r\nvocation interfered with democratic consistency of feeling, it was\r\nchiefly because this consistency of feeling had been obtained at too\r\ngreat a sacrifice--at the sacrifice of a higher to a lower type of\r\nindividuality. In all civilized communities the great individualizing\r\nforce is the resolute, efficient, and intense pursuit of special ideals,\r\nstandards, and occupations; and the country which discourages such\r\npursuits must necessarily put up with an inferior quality and a less\r\nvaried assortment of desirable individual types. But whatever the loss\r\nour country has been and is suffering from this cause, our popular\r\nphilosophers welcome rather than deplore it. We adapt our ideals of\r\nindividuality to its local examples. When orators of the Jacksonian\r\nDemocratic tradition begin to glorify the superlative individuals\r\ndeveloped by the freedom of American life, what they mean by\r\nindividuality is an unusual amount of individual energy successfully\r\nspent in popular and remunerative occupations. Of the individuality\r\nwhich may reside in the gallant and exclusive devotion to some\r\ndisinterested, and perhaps unpopular moral, intellectual, or technical\r\npurpose, they have not the remotest conception; and yet it is this kind\r\nof individuality which is indispensable to the fullness and intensity of\r\nAmerican national life.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE WHIG FAILURE\r\n\r\nThe Jacksonian Democrats were not, of course, absolutely dominant during\r\nthe Middle Period of American history. They were persistently, and on a\r\nfew occasions successfully, opposed by the Whigs. The latter naturally\r\nrepresented the political, social, and economic ideas which the\r\nDemocrats under-valued or disparaged. They were strong in those Northern\r\nand border states, which had reached a higher stage of economic and\r\nsocial development, and which contained the mansions of contemporary\r\nAmerican culture, wealth, and intelligence. It is a significant fact\r\nthat the majority of Americans of intelligence during the Jacksonian\r\nepoch were opponents of Jackson, just as the majority of educated\r\nAmericans of intelligence have always protested against the national\r\npolitical irresponsibility and the social equalitarianism characteristic\r\nof our democratic tradition; but unfortunately they have always failed\r\nto make their protests effective. The spirit of the times was against\r\nthem. The Whigs represented the higher standards, the more definite\r\norganization, and the social inequalities of the older states, but when\r\nthey attempted to make their ideas good, they were faced by a dilemma\r\neither horn of which was disastrous to their interests. They were\r\ncompelled either to sacrifice their standards to the conditions of\r\npopular efficiency or the chance of success to the integrity of their\r\nstandards. In point of fact they pursued precisely the worst course of\r\nall. They abandoned their standards, and yet they failed to achieve\r\nsuccess. Down to the Civil War the fruits of victory and the prestige of\r\npopularity were appropriated by the Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, like their predecessors, the Federalists, were ostensibly the\r\nparty of national ideas. Their association began with a group of\r\nJeffersonian Republicans who, after the second English war, sought to\r\nresume the interrupted work of national consolidation. The results of\r\nthat war had clearly exposed certain grave deficiencies in the American\r\nnational organization; and these deficiencies a group of progressive\r\nyoung men, under the lead of Calhoun and Clay, proposed to remedy. One\r\nof the greatest handicaps from which the military conduct of the war had\r\nsuffered was the lack of any sufficient means of internal communication;\r\nand the construction of a system of national roads and waterways became\r\nan important plank in their platform. There was also proposed a policy\r\nof industrial protection which Calhoun supported by arguments so\r\nnational in import and scope that they might well have been derived\r\nfrom Hamilton's report. Under the influence of similar ideas the\r\nNational Bank was rechartered; and as the correlative of this\r\nconstructive policy, a liberal nationalistic interpretation of the\r\nConstitution was explicitly advocated. As one reads the speeches\r\ndelivered by some of these men, particularly by Calhoun, during the\r\nfirst session of Congress after the conclusion of peace, it seems as if\r\na genuine revival had taken place of Hamiltonian nationalism, and that\r\nthis revival was both by way of escaping Hamilton's fatal distrust of\r\ndemocracy and of avoiding the factious and embittered opposition of the\r\nearlier period.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs made a fair start, but unfortunately they ran a poor race and\r\ncame to a bad end. No doubt they were in a way an improvement on the\r\nFederalists, in that they, like their opponents, the Democrats, stood\r\nfor a combination between democracy and nationalism. They believed that\r\nthe consolidation and the development of the national organization was\r\ncontributory rather than antagonistic to the purpose of the American\r\npolitical system. Yet they made no conquests on behalf of their\r\nconvictions. The Federalists really accomplished a great and necessary\r\ntask of national organization and founded a tradition of constructive\r\nnational achievement. The Whigs at best kept this tradition alive. They\r\nwere on the defensive throughout, and they accomplished nothing at all\r\nin the way of permanent constructive legislation. Their successes were\r\nmerely electioneering raids, whereas their defeats were wholly\r\ndisastrous in that they lost, not only all of their strongholds, but\r\nmost of their military reputation and good name. Their final\r\ndisappearance was wholly the result of their own incapacity. They were\r\ncondemned somehow to inefficiency, defeat, and dishonor.\r\n\r\nEvery important article in their programme went astray. The policy of\r\ninternal improvements in the national interest and at the national\r\nexpense was thwarted by the Constitutional scruples of such Presidents\r\nas Monroe and Jackson, and for that reason it could never be discussed\r\non its merits. The Cumberland Road was the only great national highway\r\nconstructed, and remains to this day a striking symbol of what the\r\nFederal government might have accomplished towards the establishment of\r\nan efficient system of inter-state communication. The re-charter of the\r\nNational Bank which was one of the first fruits of the new national\r\nmovement, proved in the end to be the occasion of its most flagrant\r\nfailure. The Bank was the national institution for the perpetuation of\r\nwhich the Whig leaders fought most persistently and loyally. They began\r\nthe fight with the support of public opinion, and with the prestige of\r\nan established and useful institution in their favor; but the campaign\r\nwas conducted with such little skill that in the end they were utterly\r\nbeaten. Far from being able to advance the policy of national\r\nconsolidation, they were unable even to preserve existing national\r\ninstitutions, and their conspicuous failure in this crucial instance was\r\ndue to their inability to keep public opinion convinced of the truth\r\nthat the Bank was really organized and maintained in the national\r\ninterest. Their policy of protection met in the long run with a similar\r\nfate. In the first place, the tariff schedules which they successively\r\nplaced upon the statute books were not drawn up in Hamilton's wise and\r\nmoderate national spirit. They were practically dictated by the special\r\ninterests which profited from the increases in duties. The Whig leaders\r\naccepted a retainer from the manufacturers of the North, and by\r\nlegislating exclusively in their favor almost drove South Carolina to\r\nsecession. Then after accomplishing this admirable feat, they agreed to\r\nplacate the disaffected state by the gradual reduction in the scale of\r\nduties until there was very little protection left. In short, they first\r\nperverted the protectionist system until it ceased to be a national\r\npolicy; and then compromised it until it ceased to be any policy at all.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Whigs failed and blundered most completely in the fight\r\nwhich they made against the Federal executive and in the interest of the\r\nFederal legislature. They were forced into this position, because for\r\nmany years the Democrats, impersonated by Jackson, occupied the\r\nPresidential chair, while the Whigs controlled one or both of the\r\nCongressional bodies; but the attitude of the two opposing parties in\r\nrespect to the issue corresponded to an essential difference of\r\norganization and personnel. The Whigs were led by a group of brilliant\r\norators and lawyers, while the Democrats were dominated by one powerful\r\nman, who held the Presidential office. Consequently the Whigs\r\nproclaimed a Constitutional doctrine which practically amounted to\r\nCongressional omnipotence, and for many years assailed Jackson as a\r\nmilitary dictator who was undermining the representative institutions of\r\nhis country. The American people, however, appraised these fulminations\r\nat their true value. While continuing for twelve years to elect to the\r\nPresidency Jackson or his nominee, they finally dispossessed the Whigs\r\nfrom the control of Congress; and they were right. The American people\r\nhave much more to fear from Congressional usurpation than they have from\r\nexecutive usurpation. Both Jackson and Lincoln somewhat strained their\r\npowers, but for good purposes, and in essentially a moderate and candid\r\nspirit; but when Congress attempts to dominate the executive, its\r\nobjects are generally bad and its methods furtive and dangerous. Our\r\nlegislatures were and still are the strongholds of special and local\r\ninterests, and anything which undermines executive authority in this\r\ncountry seriously threatens our national integrity and balance. It is to\r\nthe credit of the American people that they have instinctively\r\nrecognized this fact, and have estimated at their true value the tirades\r\nwhich men no better than Henry Clay level against men no worse than\r\nAndrew Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the failure of the Whigs was that their opponents\r\nembodied more completely the living forces of contemporary American\r\nlife. Jackson and his followers prevailed because they were simple,\r\nenergetic, efficient, and strong. Their consistency of feeling and their\r\nmutual loyalty enabled them to form a much more effective partisan\r\norganization than that of the Whigs. It is one of those interesting\r\nparadoxes, not uncommon in American history, that the party which\r\nrepresented official organization and leadership was loosely organized\r\nand unwisely led, while the party which distrusted official organization\r\nand surrounded official leadership with rigid restraints was most\r\nefficiently organized and was for many years absolutely dominated by a\r\nsingle man. At bottom, of course, the difference between the two parties\r\nwas a difference in vitality. All the contemporary conditions worked in\r\nfavor of the strong narrow man with prodigious force of will like Andrew\r\nJackson, and against men like Henry Clay and Daniel Webster who had more\r\nintelligence, but were deficient in force of character and singleness\r\nof purpose. The former had behind him the impulse of a great popular\r\nmovement which was sweeping irresistibly towards wholly unexpected\r\nresults; and the latter, while ostensibly trying to stem the tide, were\r\nin reality carried noisily along on its flood.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster and Henry Clay were in fact faced by an alternative\r\nsimilar to that which sterilized the lives of almost all their\r\ncontemporaries who represented an intellectual interest. They were men\r\nof national ideas but of something less than national feeling. Their\r\ninterests, temperament, and manner of life prevented them from\r\ninstinctively sympathizing with the most vital social and political\r\nmovement of their day. If they wanted popularity, they had to purchase\r\nit by compromises, whereas Andrew Jackson obtained a much larger popular\r\nfollowing by acting strictly in accordance with the dictates of his\r\ntemperament and ideas. He was effective and succeeded because his\r\npersonality was representative of the American national democracy,\r\nwhereas they failed, on the whole, because the constituency they\r\nrepresented concealed limited sympathies and special interests under\r\nwords of national import. Jackson, who in theory was the servant and\r\nmouthpiece of his followers, played the part of a genuine leader in his\r\ncampaign against the National Bank; while the Whigs, who should have\r\nbeen able to look ahead and educate their fellow-countrymen up to the\r\nlevel of their presumably better insight, straggled along in the rear of\r\nthe procession.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the Democrats, under the lead of Jackson, were\r\ntemporarily the national party, although they used their genuinely\r\nnational standing to impose in certain respects a group of anti-national\r\nideas on their country. The Whigs, on the other hand, national as they\r\nmight be in ideas and aspirations, were in effect not much better than a\r\nfaction. Finding that they could not rally behind their ideas an\r\neffective popular following, they were obliged to seek support, partly\r\nat the hands of special interests and partly by means of the sacrifice\r\nof their convictions. Under their guidance the national policy became a\r\npolicy of conciliation and compromise at any cost, and the national idea\r\nwas deprived of consistency and dignity. It became equivalent to a\r\nhodge-podge of policies and purposes, the incompatibility of whose\r\ningredients was concealed behind a smooth crust of constitutional\r\nlegality and popular acquiescence. The national idea and interest, that\r\nis, was not merely disarmed and ignored, as it had been by Jefferson. It\r\nwas mutilated and distorted in obedience to an erroneous democratic\r\ntheory; and its friends, the Whigs, deluded themselves with the belief\r\nthat in draining the national idea of its vitality they were prolonging\r\nits life. But if its life was saved, its safety was chiefly due to its\r\nostensible enemies. While the Whigs were less national in feeling and\r\npurpose than their ideas demanded, the Democrats were more national than\r\nthey knew. From 1830 to 1850 American nationality was being attenuated\r\nas a conscious idea, but the great unconscious forces of American life\r\nwere working powerfully and decisively in its favor.\r\n\r\nMost assuredly the failure of the Whigs is susceptible of abundant\r\nexplanation. Prevailing conditions were inimical to men whose strength\r\nlay more in their intelligence than in their will. It was a period of\r\nbig phrases, of personal motives and altercations, of intellectual\r\nattenuation, and of narrow, moral commonplaces,--all of which made it\r\nvery difficult for any statesman to see beyond his nose, or in case he\r\ndid, to act upon his knowledge. Yet in spite of all this, it does seem\r\nas if some Whig might have worked out the logic of the national idea\r\nwith as much power and consistency as Calhoun worked out the logic of\r\nhis sectional idea. That no Whig rose to the occasion is an indication\r\nthat in sacrificing their ideas they were sacrificing also their\r\npersonal integrity. Intellectual insincerity and irresponsibility was in\r\nthe case of the Democrats the outcome of their lives and their point of\r\nview; but on the part of the Whigs it was equivalent to sheer\r\nself-prostitution. Jefferson's work had been done only too well. The\r\ncountry had become so entirely possessed by a system of individual\r\naggrandizement, national drift, and mental torpor that the men who for\r\ntheir own moral and intellectual welfare should have opposed it, were\r\nreduced to the position of hangers-on; and the dangers of the situation\r\nwere most strikingly revealed by the attitude which contemporary\r\nstatesmen assumed towards the critical national problem of the\r\nperiod,--the problem of the existence of legalized slavery in a\r\ndemocratic state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSLAVERY AND AMERICAN NATIONALITY\r\n\r\nBoth the Whig and the Democratic parties betrayed the insufficiency of\r\ntheir ideas by their behavior towards the problem of slavery. Hitherto I\r\nhave refrained from comment on the effect which the institution of\r\nslavery was coming to have upon American politics because the increasing\r\nimportance of slavery, and of the resulting anti-slavery agitation,\r\ndemand for the purpose of this book special consideration. Such a\r\nconsideration must now be undertaken. The bitter personal and partisan\r\ncontroversies of the Whigs and the Democrats were terminated by the\r\nappearance of a radical and a perilous issue; and in the settlement of\r\nthis question the principles of both of these parties, in the manner in\r\nwhich they had been applied, were of no vital assistance.\r\n\r\nThe issue was created by the legal existence in the United States of an\r\nessentially undemocratic institution. The United States was a democracy,\r\nand however much or little this phrase means, it certainly excludes any\r\nownership of one man by another. Yet this was just what the Constitution\r\nsanctioned. Its makers had been confronted by the legal existence of\r\nslavery in nearly all of the constituent states; and a refusal to\r\nrecognize the institution would have resulted in the failure of the\r\nwhole scheme of Constitutional legislation. Consequently they did not\r\nseek to forbid negro servitude; and inasmuch as it seemed at that time\r\nto be on the road to extinction through the action of natural causes,\r\nthe makers of the Constitution had a good excuse for refusing to\r\nsacrifice their whole project to the abolition of slavery, and in\r\nthrowing thereby upon the future the burden of dealing with it in some\r\nmore radical and consistent way. Later, however, it came to pass that\r\nslavery, instead of being gradually extinguished by economic causes, was\r\nfastened thereby more firmly than ever upon one section of the country.\r\nThe whole agricultural, political, and social life of the South became\r\ndominated by the existence of negro slavery; and the problem of\r\nreconciling the expansion of such an institution with the logic of our\r\nnational idea was bound to become critical. Our country was committed by\r\nevery consideration of national honor and moral integrity to make its\r\ninstitutions thoroughly democratic, and it could not continue to permit\r\nthe aggressive legal existence of human servitude without degenerating\r\ninto a glaring example of political and moral hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nThe two leading political parties deliberately and persistently sought\r\nto evade the issue. The Western pioneers were so fascinated with the\r\nvision of millions of pale-faced democrats, leading free and prosperous\r\nlives as the reward for virtuously taking care of their own business,\r\nthat the Constitutional existence of negro slavery did not in the least\r\ndiscommode them. Disunionism they detested and would fight to the end;\r\nbut to waste valuable time in bothering about a perplexing and an\r\napparently irremediable political problem was in their eyes the worst\r\nkind of economy. They were too optimistic and too superficial to\r\nanticipate any serious trouble in the Promised Land of America; and they\r\nwere so habituated to inconsistent and irresponsible political thinking,\r\nthat they attached no importance to the moral and intellectual turpitude\r\nimplied by the existence of slavery in a democratic nation. The\r\nresponsibility of the Whigs for evading the issue is more serious than\r\nthat of the Democrats. Their leaders were the trained political thinkers\r\nof their generation. They were committed by the logic of their party\r\nplatform to protect the integrity of American national life and to\r\nconsolidate its organization. But the Whigs, almost as much as the\r\nDemocrats, refused to take seriously the legal existence of slavery.\r\nThey shirked the problem whenever they could and for as long as they\r\ncould; and they looked upon the men who persisted in raising it aloft as\r\nperverse fomenters of discord and trouble. The truth is, of course, that\r\nboth of the dominant parties were merely representing the prevailing\r\nattitude towards slavery of American public opinion. That attitude was\r\ncharacterized chiefly by moral and intellectual cowardice. Throughout\r\nthe whole of the Middle Period the increasing importance of negro\r\nservitude was the ghost in the house of the American democracy. The\r\ngood Americans of the day sought to exorcise the ghost by many amiable\r\ndevices. Sometimes they would try to lock him up in a cupboard;\r\nsometimes they would offer him a soothing bribe; more often they would\r\nbe content with shutting their eyes and pretending that he was not\r\npresent. But in proportion as he was kindly treated he persisted in\r\nintruding, until finally they were obliged to face the alternative,\r\neither of giving him possession of the house or taking possession of it\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nForeign commentators on American history have declared that a peaceable\r\nsolution of the slavery question was not beyond the power of wise and\r\npatriotic statesmanship. This may or may not be true. No solution of the\r\nproblem could have been at once final and peaceable, unless it provided\r\nfor the ultimate extinction of slavery without any violation of the\r\nConstitutional rights of the Southern states; and it may well be that\r\nthe Southern planters could never have been argued or persuaded into\r\nabolishing an institution which they eventually came to believe was a\r\nrighteous method of dealing with an inferior race. Nobody can assert\r\nwith any confidence that they could have been brought by candid,\r\ncourageous, and just negotiation and discussion into a reasonable frame\r\nof mind; but what we do know and can assert is that during the three\r\ndecades from 1820 to 1850, the national political leaders made\r\nabsolutely no attempt to deal resolutely, courageously, or candidly with\r\nthe question. On those occasions when it _would_ come to the surface,\r\nthey contented themselves and public opinion with meaningless\r\ncompromises. It would have been well enough to frame compromises suited\r\nto the immediate occasion, provided the problem of ultimately\r\nextinguishing slavery without rending the Union had been kept\r\npersistently on the surface of political discussion: but the object of\r\nthese compromises was not to cure the disease, but merely to allay its\r\nsymptoms. They would not admit that slavery was a disease; and in the\r\nend this habit of systematic drifting and shirking on the part of\r\nmoderate and sensible men threw the national responsibility upon\r\nAbolitionist extremists, in whose hands the issue took such a distorted\r\nemphasis that gradually a peaceable preservation of American national\r\nintegrity became impossible.\r\n\r\nThe problem of slavery was admirably designed to bring out the confusion\r\nof ideas and the inconsistency resident in the traditional American\r\npolitical system. The groundwork of that system consisted, as we have\r\nseen, in the alliance between democracy, as formulated in the\r\nJeffersonian creed, and American nationality, as embodied in the\r\nConstitutional Union; and the two dominant political parties of the\r\nMiddle Period, the Whigs and the Jacksonian Democrats, both believed in\r\nthe necessity of such an alliance. But negro slavery, just in so far as\r\nit became an issue, tended to make the alliance precarious. The national\r\norganization embodied in the Constitution authorized not only the\r\nexistence of negro slavery, but its indefinite expansion. American\r\ndemocracy, on the other hand, as embodied in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence and in the spirit and letter of the Jeffersonian creed, was\r\nhostile from certain points of view to the institution of negro slavery.\r\nLoyalty to the Constitution meant disloyalty to democracy, and an active\r\ninterest in the triumph of democracy seemed to bring with it the\r\ncondemnation of the Constitution. What, then, was a good American to do\r\nwho was at once a convinced democrat and a loyal Unionist?\r\n\r\nThe ordinary answer to this question was, of course, expressed in the\r\nbehavior of public opinion during the Middle Period. The thing to do was\r\nto shut your eyes to the inconsistency, denounce anybody who insisted on\r\nit as unpatriotic, and then hold on tight to both horns of the dilemma.\r\nMen of high intelligence, who really loved their country, and believed\r\nin the democratic idea, persisted in this attitude, whose ablest and\r\nmost distinguished representative was Daniel Webster. He is usually\r\nconsidered as the most eloquent and effective expositor of American\r\nnationalism who played an important part during the Middle Period; and\r\nunquestionably he came nearer to thinking nationally than did any\r\nAmerican statesman of his generation. He defended the Union against the\r\nNullifiers as decisively in one way as Jackson did in another. Jackson\r\nflourished his sword, while Webster taught American public opinion to\r\nconsider the Union as the core and the crown of the American political\r\nsystem. His services in giving the Union a more impressive place in the\r\nAmerican political imagination can scarcely be over-estimated. Had the\r\nother Whig leaders joined him in refusing to compromise with the\r\nNullifiers and in strengthening by legislation the Federal government\r\nas an expression of an indestructible American national unity, a\r\nprecedent might have been established which would have increased the\r\ndifficulty of a subsequent secessionist outbreak. But Henry Clay\r\nbelieved in compromises (particularly when his own name was attached to\r\nthem) as the very substance of a national American policy; and Webster\r\nwas too much of a Presidential candidate to travel very far on a lonely\r\npath. Moreover, there was a fundamental weakness in Webster's own\r\nposition, which was gradually revealed as the slavery crisis became\r\nacute. He could be bold and resolute, when defending a nationalistic\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution against the Nullifiers or the\r\nAbolitionists; but when the slaveholders themselves became aggressive in\r\npolicy and separatist in spirit, the courage of his convictions deserted\r\nhim. If an indubitably Constitutional institution, such as slavery,\r\ncould be used as an ax with which to hew at the trunk of the\r\nConstitutional tree, his whole theory of the American system was\r\nundermined, and he could speak only halting and dubious words. He was as\r\nmuch terrorized by the possible consequences of any candid and\r\ncourageous dealing with the question as were the prosperous business men\r\nof the North; and his luminous intelligence shed no light upon a\r\nquestion, which evaded his Constitutional theories, terrified his will,\r\nand clouded the radiance of his patriotic visions.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic formula, of which Webster was the ablest and most eloquent\r\nexpositor, was fairly torn to pieces by the claws of the problem of\r\nslavery. The formula triumphantly affirmed the inseparable relation\r\nbetween individual liberty and the preservation of the Federal Union;\r\nbut obviously such a formula could have no validity from the point of\r\nview of a Southerner. The liberties which men most cherish are those\r\nwhich are guaranteed to them by law--among which one of the most\r\nimportant from the Southerner's point of view was the right to own negro\r\nbondsmen. As soon as it began to appear that the perpetuation of the\r\nUnion threatened this right, they were not to be placated with any\r\nglowing proclamation about the inseparability of liberty in general from\r\nan indestructible union. From the standpoint of their own most cherished\r\nrights, they could put up a very strong argument on behalf of disunion;\r\nand they had as much of the spirit of the Constitution on their side as\r\nhad their opponents. That instrument was intended not only to give legal\r\nform to the Union of the American commonwealths and the American people,\r\nbut also to guarantee certain specified rights and liberties. If, on the\r\none hand, negro slavery undermined the moral unity and consequently the\r\npolitical integrity of the American people, and if on the other, the\r\nSouth stubbornly insisted upon its legal right to property in negroes,\r\nthe difficulty ran too deep to be solved by peaceable Constitutional\r\nmeans. The legal structure of American nationality became a house\r\ndivided against itself, and either the national principle had to be\r\nsacrificed to the Constitution or the Constitution to the national\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the whole controversy does not become clear, until\r\nwe modify Webster's formula about the inseparability of liberty and\r\nunion, and affirm in its place the inseparability of American\r\nnationality and American democracy. The Union had come to mean something\r\nmore to the Americans of the North than loyalty to the Constitution. It\r\nhad come to mean devotion to a common national idea,--the idea of\r\ndemocracy; and while the wiser among them did not want to destroy the\r\nConstitution for the benefit of democracy, they insisted that the\r\nConstitution should be officially stigmatized as in this respect an\r\ninadequate expression of the national idea. American democracy and\r\nAmerican nationality are inseparably related, precisely because\r\ndemocracy means very much more than liberty or liberties, whether\r\nnatural or legal, and nationality very much more than an indestructible\r\nlegal association. Webster's formula counseled an evasion of the problem\r\nof slavery. From his point of view it was plainly insoluble. But an\r\naffirmation of an inseparable relationship between American nationality\r\nand American democracy would just as manifestly have demanded its\r\ncandid, courageous, and persistent agitation.\r\n\r\nThe slavery question, when it could no longer be avoided, gradually\r\nseparated the American people into five different political parties or\r\nfactions--the Abolitionists, the Southern Democrats, the Northern\r\nDemocrats, the Constitutional Unionists, and the Republicans. Each of\r\nthese factions selected one of the several alternative methods of\r\nsolution or evasion, to which the problem of negro slavery could be\r\nreduced, and each deserves its special consideration.\r\n\r\nOf the five alternatives, the least substantial was that of the\r\nConstitutional Unionists. These well-meaning gentlemen, composed for the\r\nmost part of former Whigs, persisted in asserting that the Constitution\r\nwas capable of solving every political problem generated under its\r\nprotection; and this assertion, in the teeth of the fact that the Union\r\nhad been torn asunder by means of a Constitutional controversy, had\r\nbecome merely an absurdity. Up to 1850 the position of such\r\nConstitutional Unionists as Webster and Clay could be plausibly\r\ndefended; but after the failure of that final compromise, it was plain\r\nthat a man of any intellectual substance must seek support for his\r\nspecial interpretation of the Constitution by means of a special\r\ninterpretation of the national idea. That slavery was Constitutional\r\nnobody could deny, any more than they could deny the Constitutionality\r\nof anti-slavery agitation. The real question, to which the controversy\r\nhad been reduced, had become, Is slavery consistent with the principle\r\nwhich constitutes the basis of American national integrity--the\r\nprinciple of democracy?\r\n\r\nEach of the four other factions answered this question in a different\r\nway; and every one of these answers was derived from different aspects\r\nof the system of traditional American ideas. The Abolitionists believed\r\nthat a democratic state, which ignored the natural rights proclaimed by\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, was a piece of organized political\r\nhypocrisy,--worthy only of destruction. The Southerners believed that\r\ndemocracy meant above all the preservation of recognized Constitutional\r\nrights in property of all kinds, and freedom from interference in the\r\nmanagement of their local affairs. The Northern Democrats insisted just\r\nas strenuously as the South on local self-government, and tried to erect\r\nit into the constituent principle of democracy; but they were loyal to\r\nthe Union and would not admit either that slavery could be nationalized,\r\nor that secession had any legal justification. Finally the Republicans\r\nbelieved with the Abolitionists that slavery was wrong; while they\r\nbelieved with the Northern Democrats that the Union must be preserved;\r\nand it was their attempt to de-nationalize slavery as undemocratic and\r\nat the same time to affirm the indestructibility of the Union, which\r\nproved in the end to be salutary.\r\n\r\nSurely never was there a more distressing example of confusion of\r\nthought in relation to a \"noble national theory.\" The traditional\r\ndemocratic system of ideas provoked fanatical activity on the part of\r\nthe Abolitionists, as the defenders of \"natural rights,\" a kindred\r\nfanaticism in the Southerners as the defenders of legal rights, and\r\nmoral indifference and lethargy on the part of the Northern Democrat for\r\nthe benefit of his own local interests. The behavior of all three\r\nfactions was dictated by the worship of what was called liberty; and the\r\nword was as confidently and glibly used by Calhoun and Davis as it was\r\nby Garrison, Webster, and Douglas. The Western Democrat, and indeed the\r\naverage American, thought of democratic liberty chiefly as individual\r\nfreedom from legal discrimination and state interference in doing some\r\nkind of a business. The Abolitionist was even more exclusively\r\npreoccupied with the liberty which the Constitution denied to the negro.\r\nThe Southerners thought only of the Constitutional rights, which the\r\nAbolitionists wished to abolish, and the Republicans to restrict. Each\r\nof the contending parties had some justification in dwelling exclusively\r\nupon the legal or natural rights, in which they were most interested,\r\nbecause the system of traditional American ideas provided no positive\r\nprinciple, in relation to which these conflicting liberties could be\r\nclassified and valued. It is in the nature of liberties and rights,\r\nabstractly considered, to be insubordinate and to conflict both one with\r\nanother and, perhaps, with the common weal. If the chief purpose of a\r\ndemocratic political system is merely the preservation of such rights,\r\ndemocracy becomes an invitation to local, factional, and individual\r\nambitions and purposes. On the other hand, if these Constitutional and\r\nnatural rights are considered a temporary philosophical or legal\r\nmachinery, whereby a democratic society is to reach a higher moral and\r\nsocial consummation, and if the national organization is considered\r\nmerely as an effective method of keeping the legal and moral machinery\r\nadjusted to the higher democratic purpose, then no individual or faction\r\nor section could claim the benefit of a democratic halo for its\r\ndistracting purposes and ambitions. Instead of subordinating these\r\nconflicting rights and liberties to the national idea, and erecting the\r\nnational organization into an effective instrument thereof, the national\r\nidea and organization was subordinated to individual local and factional\r\nideas and interests. No one could or would recognize the constructive\r\nrelation between the democratic purpose and the process of national\r\norganization and development. The men who would rend the national body\r\nin order to protect their property in negro slaves could pretend to be\r\nas good democrats as the men who would rend in order to give the negro\r\nhis liberty. And if either of these hostile factions had obtained its\r\nway, the same disastrous result would have been accomplished. American\r\nnational integrity would have been destroyed, and slavery on American\r\nsoil, in a form necessarily hostile to democracy, would have been\r\nperpetuated.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSLAVERY AS A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION\r\n\r\nI have already suggested that it was the irresponsibility and the\r\nevasions of the party politicians, which threw upon the Abolitionists\r\nthe duty of fighting slavery as an undemocratic institution. They took\r\nup the cause of the negro in a spirit of religious self-consecration.\r\nThe prevalence of irresolution and timidity in relation to slavery among\r\nthe leaders of public opinion incited the Abolitionists to a high degree\r\nof courage and exclusive devotion; and unfortunately, also, the\r\nconciliating attitude of the official leaders encouraged on the part of\r\nthe Abolitionists an outburst of fanaticism. In their devotion to their\r\nadopted cause they lost all sense of proportion, all balance of\r\njudgment, and all justice of perception; and their narrowness and want\r\nof balance is in itself a sufficient indication that they were possessed\r\nof a half, instead of a whole, truth.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Abolitionists were disinterested and for a while\r\npersecuted men should not prevent the present generation from putting a\r\njust estimate on their work. While they redeemed the honor of their\r\ncountry by assuming a grave and hard national responsibility, they\r\nsought to meet that responsibility in a way that would have destroyed\r\ntheir country. The Abolitionists, no less than the Southerners, were\r\ntearing at the fabric of American nationality. They did it, no doubt, in\r\nthe name of democracy; but of all perverted conceptions of democracy,\r\none of the most perverted and dangerous is that which identifies it\r\nexclusively with a system of natural rights. Such a conception of\r\ndemocracy is in its effect inevitably revolutionary, and merely loosens\r\nthe social and national bond. In the present instance they were betrayed\r\ninto one of the worst possible sins against the national bond--into the\r\nsin of doing a gross personal injustice to a large group of their\r\nfellow-countrymen. Inasmuch as the Southerners were willfully violating\r\na Divine law, they became in the eyes of the Abolitionists, not merely\r\nmis-guided, but wicked, men; and the Abolitionists did not scruple to\r\nspeak of them as unclean beasts, who were fattening on the fruits of an\r\niniquitous institution. But such an inference was palpably false. The\r\nSouthern slave owners were not unclean beasts; and any theory which\r\njustified such an inference must be erroneous. They were, for the most\r\npart, estimable if somewhat quick-tempered and irascible gentlemen, who\r\ndid much to mitigate the evils of negro servitude, and who were on the\r\nwhole liked rather than disliked by their bondsmen. They were right,\r\nmoreover, in believing that the negroes were a race possessed of moral\r\nand intellectual qualities inferior to those of the white men; and,\r\nhowever much they overworked their conviction of negro inferiority, they\r\ncould clearly see that the Abolitionists were applying a narrow and\r\nperverted political theory to a complicated and delicate set of economic\r\nand social conditions. It is no wonder, consequently, that they did not\r\nsubmit tamely to the abuse of the Abolitionists; and that they in their\r\nturn lost their heads. Unfortunately, however, the consequence of their\r\nwrong-headedness was more disastrous than it was in the case of the\r\nAbolitionists, because they were powerful and domineering, as well as\r\nangry and unreasonable. They were in a position, if they so willed, to\r\ntear the Union to pieces, whereas the Abolitionists could only talk and\r\nbehave as if any legal association with such sinners ought to be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Southern slaveholders, then, undoubtedly had a grievance. They were\r\nbeing abused by a faction of their fellow-countrymen, because they\r\ninsisted on enjoying a strictly legal right; and it is no wonder that\r\nthey began to think of the Abolitionists very much as the Abolitionists\r\nthought of them. Moreover, their anger was probably increased by the\r\nfact that the Abolitionists could make out some kind of a case against\r\nthem. Property in slaves was contrary to the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and had been denounced in theory by the earlier American\r\ndemocrats. So long as a conception of democracy, which placed natural\r\nabove legal rights was permitted to obtain, their property in slaves\r\nwould be imperiled: and it was necessary, consequently, for the\r\nSoutherners to advance a conception of democracy, which would stand as a\r\nfortress around their \"peculiar\" institution. During the earlier days of\r\nthe Republic no such necessity had existed. The Southerners had merely\r\nendeavored to protect their negro property by insisting on an equal\r\ndivision of the domain out of which future states were to be carved, and\r\nupon the admission into the Union of a slave state to balance every new\r\nfree commonwealth. But the attempt of the Abolitionists to identify the\r\nAmerican national idea with a system of natural rights, coupled with the\r\nplain fact that the national domain contained more material for free\r\nthan it did for slave states, provoked the Southerners into taking more\r\naggressive ground. They began to identify the national idea exclusively\r\nwith a system of legal rights; and it became from their point of view a\r\nviolation of national good faith even to criticise any rights enjoyed\r\nunder the Constitution. They advanced a conception of American\r\ndemocracy, which defied the Constitution in its most rigid\r\ninterpretation,--which made Congress incompetent to meddle with any\r\nrights enjoyed under the Constitution, which converted any protest\r\nagainst such rights into national disloyalty, and which in the end\r\nconverted secession into a species of higher Constitutional action.\r\n\r\nCalhoun's theory of Constitutional interpretation was ingeniously\r\nwrought and powerfully argued. From an exclusively legal standpoint, it\r\nwas plausible, if not convincing; but it was opposed by something deeper\r\nthan counter-theories of Constitutional law. It was opposed to the\r\nincreasingly national outlook of a large majority of the American\r\npeople. They would not submit to a conception of the American political\r\nsystem, designed exclusively to give legal protection to property in\r\nnegroes, and resulting substantially in the nationalization of slavery.\r\nThey insisted upon a conception of the Constitution, which made the\r\nnational organization the expression of a democratic idea, more\r\ncomprehensive and dignified than that of existing legal rights; and in\r\nso doing the Northerners undoubtedly had behind them, not merely the\r\nsound political idea, but also a fair share of the living American\r\ntradition. The Southerners had pushed the traditional worship of\r\nConstitutional rights to a point which subordinated the whole American\r\nlegal system to the needs of one peculiar and incongruous institution,\r\nand such an innovation was bound to be revolutionary. But when the North\r\nproposed to put its nationalistic interpretation of the Constitution\r\ninto effect, and to prevent the South by force from seceding, the South\r\ncould claim for its resistance a larger share of the American tradition\r\nthan could the North for its coercion. To insist that the Southern\r\nstates remain in the Union was assuredly an attempt to govern a whole\r\nsociety without its consent; and the fact that the Southerners rather\r\nthan the Northerners were technically violators of the law, did not\r\nprevent the former from going into battle profoundly possessed with the\r\nconviction that they were fighting for an essentially democratic cause.\r\n\r\nThe aggressive theories and policy of the Southerners made the moderate\r\nopponents of slavery realize that the beneficiaries of that institution\r\nwould, unless checked, succeed eventually in nationalizing slavery by\r\nappropriating on its behalf the national domain. A body of public\r\nopinion was gradually formed, which looked in the direction merely of\r\nde-nationalizing slavery by restricting its expansion. This body of\r\npublic opinion was finally organized into the Republican party; and this\r\nparty has certain claims to be considered the first genuinely national\r\nparty which has appeared in American politics. The character of being\r\nnational has been denied to it, because it was, compared to the old Whig\r\nand Democratic parties, a sectional organization; but a party becomes\r\nnational, not by the locus of its support, but by the national import of\r\nits idea and its policy. The Republican party was not entirely national,\r\nbecause it had originated partly in embittered sectional feeling, but it\r\nproclaimed a national idea and a national policy. It insisted on the\r\nresponsibility of the national government in relation to the institution\r\nof slavery, and it insisted also that the Union should be preserved. But\r\nbefore the Republicanism could be recognized as national even in the\r\nNorth, it was obliged to meet and vanquish one more proposed treatment\r\nof the problem of slavery--founded on an inadequate conception of\r\ndemocracy. In this case, moreover, the inadequate conception of\r\ndemocracy was much more traditionally American than was an exclusive\r\npreoccupation either with natural or legal rights; and according to its\r\nchief advocate it would have the magical result of permitting the\r\nexpansion of slavery, and of preserving the Constitutional Union,\r\nwithout doing any harm to democracy.\r\n\r\nThis was the theory of Popular Sovereignty, whose ablest exponent was\r\nStephen Douglas. About 1850, he became the official leader of the\r\nWestern Democracy. This section of the party no longer controlled the\r\norganization as it did in the days of Jackson; but it was still powerful\r\nand influential. It persisted in its loyalty to the Union coupled with\r\nits dislike of nationalizing organization; and it persisted, also, in\r\nits dislike of any interference with the individual so long as he was\r\nmaking lawful money. The legal right to own slaves was from their point\r\nof view a right like another; and not only could it not be taken away\r\nfrom the Southern states, but no individual should be deprived of it by\r\nthe national government. When a state came to be organized, such a right\r\nmight be denied by the state constitution; but the nation should do\r\nnothing to prejudice the decision. The inhabitants of the national\r\ndomain should be allowed to own slaves or not to own them, just as they\r\npleased, until the time came for the adoption of a state constitution;\r\nand any interference with this right violated democratic principles by\r\nan unjustifiable restriction upon individual and local action. Thus was\r\nanother kind of liberty invoked in order to meet the new phase of the\r\ncrisis; and if it had prevailed, the United States would have become a\r\nlegal union without national cohesion, and a democracy which issued, not\r\nillogically, in human servitude.\r\n\r\nDouglas was sincere in his belief that the principle of local or Popular\r\nSovereignty supplied a strictly democratic solution of the slavery\r\nproblem, and it was natural that he should seek to use this principle\r\nfor the purpose of reaching a permanent settlement. When with the\r\nassistance of the South he effected the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise, he honestly thought that he was replacing an arbitrary and\r\nunstable territorial division of the country into slave and free\r\nstates, by a settlement which would be stable, because it was the\r\nlogical product of the American democratic idea. The interpretation of\r\ndemocracy which dictated the proposed solution was sufficiently\r\nperverted; but it was nevertheless a faithful reflection of the\r\ntraditional point of view of the Jacksonian Democratic party, and it\r\ndeserves more respectful historical treatment than it sometimes\r\nreceives. It was, after all, the first attempt which had been made to\r\nlegislate in relation to slavery on the basis of a principle, and the\r\napplication of any honest idea to the subject-matter of the controversy\r\nserved to clear an atmosphere which for thirty years had been clouded by\r\nunprincipled compromises. The methods and the objects of the several\r\ndifferent parties were made suddenly definite and unmistakable; and\r\ntheir representatives found it necessary for the first time to stand\r\nfirmly upon their convictions instead of sacrificing them in order to\r\nmaintain an appearance of peace. It soon became apparent that not even\r\nthis erection of national irresponsibility into a principle would be\r\nsufficient to satisfy the South, because the interests of the South had\r\ncome to demand the propagation of slavery as a Constitutional right, and\r\nif necessary in defiance of local public opinion. Unionists were\r\nconsequently given to understand that the South was offering them a\r\nchoice between a divided Union and the nationalization of slavery; and\r\nthey naturally drew the conclusion that they must de-nationalize slavery\r\nin order to perpetuate the Union. The repeal, consequently, hastened the\r\nformation of the Republican party, whose object it was to prevent the\r\nexpansion of slavery and to preserve the Union, without violating the\r\nConstitutional rights of the South. Such a policy could no longer\r\nprevail without a war. The Southerners had no faith in the fair\r\nintentions of their opponents. They worked themselves into the belief\r\nthat The whole anti-slavery party was Abolitionist, and the whole\r\nanti-slavery agitation national disloyalty. But the issue had been so\r\nshaped that the war could be fought for the purpose of preserving\r\nAmerican national integrity; and that was the only issue on which a\r\nrighteous war could be fought.\r\n\r\nThus the really decisive debates which preceded the Civil War were not\r\nthose which took place in Congress over states-rights, but rather the\r\ndiscussion in Illinois between Lincoln and Douglas as to whether\r\nslavery was a local or a national issue. The Congressional debates were\r\non both sides merely a matter of legal special pleading for the purpose\r\nof justifying a preconceived decision. What it was necessary for\r\npatriotic American citizens and particularly for Western Democrats to\r\nunderstand was, not whether the South possessed a dubious right of\r\nsecession, because that dispute, in case it came to a head, could only\r\nbe settled by war; but whether a democratic nation could on democratic\r\nprinciples continue to shirk the problem of slavery by shifting the\r\nresponsibility for it to individuals and localities. As soon as Lincoln\r\nmade it plain that a democratic nation could not make local and\r\nindividual rights an excuse for national irresponsibility, then the\r\nUnionist party could count upon the support of the American conscience.\r\nThe former followers of Douglas finally rallied to the man and to the\r\nparty which stood for a nationalized rather than a merely localized\r\ndemocracy; and the triumph of the North in the war, not only put an end\r\nto the legal right of secession, but it began to emancipate the American\r\nnational idea from an obscurantist individualism and provincialism. Our\r\ncurrent interpretation of democracy still contains much dubious matter\r\nderived from the Jacksonian epoch; but no American statesmen can\r\nhereafter follow Douglas in making the democratic principle equivalent\r\nto utter national incoherence and irresponsibility.\r\n\r\nMr. Theodore Roosevelt in his addresses to the veterans of the Civil War\r\nhas been heard to assert that the crisis teaches us a much-needed lesson\r\nas to the supreme value of moral energy. It would have been much\r\npleasanter and cheaper to let the South secede, but the people of the\r\nNorth preferred to pay the cost of justifiable coercion in blood and\r\ntreasure than to submit to the danger and humiliation of peaceable\r\nrebellion. Doubtless the foregoing is sometimes a wholesome lesson on\r\nwhich to insist, but it is by no means the only lesson suggested by the\r\nevent. The Abolitionists had not shirked their duty as they understood\r\nit. They had given their property and their lives to the anti-slavery\r\nagitation. But they were as willing as the worst Copperheads to permit\r\nthe secession of the South, because of the erroneous and limited\r\ncharacter of their political ideas. While the crisis had undoubtedly\r\nbeen, in a large measure, brought about by moral lethargy, and it could\r\nonly be properly faced by a great expenditure of moral energy, it had\r\nalso been brought about quite as much by political unintelligence; and\r\nthe salvation of the Union depended primarily and emphatically upon a\r\nbetter understanding on the part of Northern public opinion of the\r\nissues involved. Confused as was the counsel offered to them, and\r\ndistracting as were their habits of political thought, the people of the\r\nNorth finally disentangled the essential question, and then supported\r\nloyally the man who, more than any other single political leader, had\r\nproperly defined the issue.\r\n\r\nThat man was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's peculiar service to his\r\ncountrymen before the war was that of seeing straighter and thinking\r\nharder than did his contemporaries. No doubt he must needs have courage,\r\nalso, for in the beginning he acted against the advice of his Republican\r\nassociates. But in 1858 there were plenty of men who had the courage,\r\nwhereas there were very few who had Lincoln's disciplined intelligence\r\nand his just and penetrating insight. Lincoln's vision placed every\r\naspect of the situation in its proper relations; and he was as fully\r\ncompetent to detect the logical weakness of his opponent's position as\r\nhe was to explain his own lucidly, candidly, and persuasively. It so\r\nhappened that the body of public opinion which he particularly addressed\r\nwas that very part of the American democracy most likely to be deluded\r\ninto allowing the Southern leaders to have their will, yet whose\r\nadhesion to the national cause was necessary to the preservation of the\r\nUnion. It was into this mass of public opinion, after the announcement\r\nof his senatorial candidacy, that he hammered a new and a hard truth. He\r\nwas the first responsible politician to draw the logical inference from\r\nthe policy of the Republican party. The Constitution was inadequate to\r\ncure the ills it generated. By its authorization of slavery it\r\nestablished an institution whose legality did not prevent it from being\r\nanti-national. That institution must either be gradually reduced to\r\ninsignificance, or else it must transform and take possession of the\r\nAmerican national idea. The Union had become a house divided against\r\nitself; and this deep-lying division could not be bridged merely by\r\nloyal Constitutionalism or by an anti-national interpretation of\r\ndemocracy. The legal Union was being threatened precisely because\r\nAmerican national integrity was being gutted by an undemocratic\r\ninstitution. The house must either fall or else cease to be divided.\r\nThus for the first time it was clearly proclaimed by a responsible\r\npolitician that American nationality was a living principle rather than\r\na legal bond; and Lincoln's service to his country in making the Western\r\nDemocracy understand that living Americans were responsible for their\r\nnational integrity can scarcely be over-valued. The ground was cut from\r\nunder the traditional point of view of the pioneer--which had been to\r\nfeel patriotic and national, but to plan and to agitate only for the\r\nfulfillment of local and individual ends.\r\n\r\nThe virtue of Lincoln's attitude may seem to be as much a matter of\r\ncharacter as of intelligence; and such, indeed, is undoubtedly the case.\r\nMy point is, not that Lincoln's greatness was more a matter of intellect\r\nthan of will, but that he rendered to his country a peculiar service,\r\nbecause his luminous and disciplined intelligence and his national\r\noutlook enabled him to give each aspect of a complicated and confused\r\nsituation its proper relative emphasis. At a later date, when he had\r\nbecome President and was obliged to take decisive action in order to\r\nprevent the House from utterly collapsing, he showed an inflexibility of\r\npurpose no less remarkable than his previous intellectual insight. For\r\nas long as he had not made up his mind, he hesitated firmly and\r\npatiently; but when he had made up his mind, he was not to be confused\r\nor turned aside. Indeed, during the weeks of perplexity which preceded\r\nthe bombardment of Fort Sumter, Lincoln sometimes seems to be the one\r\nwise and resolute man among a group of leaders who were either resolute\r\nand foolish or wise (after a fashion) and irresolute. The amount of bad\r\nadvice which was offered to the American people at this moment is\r\nappalling, and is to be explained only by the bad moral and intellectual\r\nhabits fastened upon our country during forty years of national\r\nturpitude. But Lincoln never for an instant allowed his course to be\r\ndiverted. If the Union was attacked, he was prepared actively to defend\r\nit. If it was let alone, he was prepared to do what little he could\r\ntowards the de-nationalization of slavery. But he refused absolutely to\r\nthrow away the fruits of Republican victory by renewing the policy of\r\nfutile and unprincipled compromises. Back of all his opinions there was\r\nan ultimate stability of purpose which was the result both of sound\r\nmental discipline and of a firm will. His was a mind, unlike that of\r\nClay, Seward, or even Webster, which had never been cheapened by its own\r\nexercise. During his mature years he rarely, if ever, proclaimed an idea\r\nwhich he had not mastered, and he never abandoned a truth which he had\r\nonce thoroughly achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AS MORE THAN AN AMERICAN\r\n\r\nLincoln's services to his country have been rewarded with such abundant\r\nappreciation that it may seem superfluous to insist upon them once\r\nagain; but I believe that from the point of view of this book an even\r\nhigher value may be placed, if not upon his patriotic service, at least\r\nupon his personal worth. The Union might well have been saved and\r\nslavery extinguished without his assistance; but the life of no other\r\nAmerican has revealed with anything like the same completeness the\r\npeculiar moral promise of genuine democracy. He shows us by the full but\r\nunconscious integrity of his example the kind of human excellence which\r\na political and social democracy may and should fashion; and its most\r\ngrateful and hopeful aspect is, not merely that there is something\r\npartially American about the manner of his excellence, but that it can\r\nbe fairly compared with the classic types of consummate personal\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nTo all appearance nobody could have been more than Abraham Lincoln a man\r\nof his own time and place. Until 1858 his outer life ran much in the\r\nsame groove as that of hundreds of other Western politicians and\r\nlawyers. Beginning as a poor and ignorant boy, even less provided with\r\nprops and stepping-stones than were his associates, he had worked his\r\nway to a position of ordinary professional and political distinction. He\r\nwas not, like Douglas, a brilliant success. He was not, like Grant, an\r\napparently hopeless failure. He had achieved as much and as little as\r\nhundreds of others had achieved. He was respected by his neighbors as\r\nan honest man and as a competent lawyer. They credited him with\r\nability, but not to any extraordinary extent. No one would have pointed\r\nhim out as a remarkable and distinguished man. He had shown himself to\r\nbe desirous of recognition and influence; but ambition had not been the\r\ncompelling motive in his life. In most respects his ideas, interests,\r\nand standards were precisely the same as those of his associates. He\r\naccepted with them the fabric of traditional American political thought\r\nand the ordinary standards of contemporary political morality. He had\r\nnone of the moral strenuousness of the reformer, none of the\r\nexclusiveness of a man, whose purposes and ideas were consciously\r\nperched higher than those of his neighbors. Probably the majority of his\r\nmore successful associates classed him as a good and able man who was\r\nsomewhat lacking in ambition and had too much of a disposition to loaf.\r\nHe was most at home, not in his own house, but in the corner grocery\r\nstore, where he could sit with his feet on the stove swapping stories\r\nwith his friends; and if an English traveler of 1850 had happened in on\r\nthe group, he would most assuredly have discovered another instance of\r\nthe distressing vulgarity to which the absence of an hereditary\r\naristocracy and an established church condemned the American democracy.\r\nThus no man could apparently have been more the average product of his\r\nday and generation. Nevertheless, at bottom, Abraham Lincoln differed as\r\nessentially from the ordinary Western American of the Middle Period as\r\nSt. Francis of Assisi differed from the ordinary Benedictine monk of the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe average Western American of Lincoln's generation was fundamentally a\r\nman who subordinated his intelligence to certain dominant practical\r\ninterests and purposes. He was far from being a stupid or slow-witted\r\nman. On the contrary, his wits had been sharpened by the traffic of\r\nAmerican politics and business, and his mind was shrewd, flexible, and\r\nalert. But he was wholly incapable either of disinterested or of\r\nconcentrated intellectual exertion. His energies were bent in the\r\nconquest of certain stubborn external forces, and he used his\r\nintelligence almost exclusively to this end. The struggles, the\r\nhardships, and the necessary self-denial of pioneer life constituted an\r\nadmirable training of the will. It developed a body of men with great\r\nresolution of purpose and with great ingenuity and fertility in\r\nadapting their insufficient means to the realization of their important\r\nbusiness affairs. But their almost exclusive preoccupation with\r\npractical tasks and their failure to grant their intelligence any room\r\nfor independent exercise bent them into exceedingly warped and one-sided\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nLincoln, on the contrary, much as he was a man of his own time and\r\npeople, was precisely an example of high and disinterested intellectual\r\nculture. During all the formative years in which his life did not\r\nsuperficially differ from that of his associates, he was in point of\r\nfact using every chance which the material of Western life afforded to\r\ndiscipline and inform his mind. These materials were not very abundant;\r\nand in the use which he proceeded to make of them Lincoln had no\r\nassistance, either from a sound tradition or from a better educated\r\nmaster. On the contrary, as the history of the times shows, there was\r\nevery temptation for a man with a strong intellectual bent to be\r\nbetrayed into mere extravagance and aberration. But with the sound\r\ninstinct of a well-balanced intelligence Lincoln seized upon the three\r\navailable books, the earnest study of which might best help to develop\r\nharmoniously a strong and many-sided intelligence. He seized, that is,\r\nupon the Bible, Shakespeare, and Euclid. To his contemporaries the Bible\r\nwas for the most part a fountain of fanatic revivalism, and Shakespeare,\r\nif anything, a mine of quotations. But in the case of Lincoln,\r\nShakespeare and the Bible served, not merely to awaken his taste and\r\nfashion his style, but also to liberate his literary and moral\r\nimagination. At the same time he was training his powers of thought by\r\nan assiduous study of algebra and geometry. The absorbing hours he spent\r\nover his Euclid were apparently of no use to him in his profession; but\r\nLincoln was in his way an intellectual gymnast and enjoyed the exertion\r\nfor its own sake. Such a use of his leisure must have seemed a sheer\r\nwaste of time to his more practical friends, and they might well have\r\naccounted for his comparative lack of success by his indulgence in such\r\nsecret and useless pastimes. Neither would this criticism have been\r\nbeside the mark, for if Lincoln's great energy and powers of work had\r\nbeen devoted exclusively to practical ends, he might well have become in\r\nthe early days a more prominent lawyer and politician than he actually\r\nwas. But he preferred the satisfaction of his own intellectual and\r\nsocial instincts, and so qualified himself for achievements beyond the\r\npower of a Douglas.\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, to these private gymnastics Lincoln shared with\r\nhis neighbors a public and popular source of intellectual and human\r\ninsight. The Western pioneers, for all their exclusive devotion to\r\npractical purposes, wasted a good deal of time on apparently useless\r\nsocial intercourse. In the Middle Western towns of that day there was,\r\nas we have seen, an extraordinary amount of good-fellowship, which was\r\nquite the most wholesome and humanizing thing which entered into the\r\nlines of these hard-working and hard-featured men. The whole male\r\ncountryside was in its way a club; and when the presence of women did\r\nnot make them awkward and sentimental, the men let themselves loose in\r\nan amount of rough pleasantry and free conversation, which added the one\r\ngenial and liberating touch to their lives. This club life of his own\r\npeople Lincoln enjoyed and shared much more than did his average\r\nneighbor. He passed the greater part of what he would have called his\r\nleisure time in swapping with his friends stories, in which the genial\r\nand humorous side of Western life was embodied. Doubtless his domestic\r\nunhappiness had much to do with his vagrancy; but his native instinct\r\nfor the wholesome and illuminating aspect of the life around him brought\r\nhim more frequently than any other cause to the club of loafers in the\r\ngeneral store. And whatever the promiscuous conversation and the racy\r\nyarns meant to his associates, they meant vastly more to Lincoln. His\r\nhours of social vagrancy really completed the process of his\r\nintellectual training. It relieved his culture from the taint of\r\nbookishness. It gave substance to his humor. It humanized his wisdom and\r\nenabled him to express it in a familiar and dramatic form. It placed at\r\nhis disposal, that is, the great classic vehicle of popular expression,\r\nwhich is the parable and the spoken word.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was just because he shared so completely the amusements\r\nand the occupations of his neighbors that his private personal culture\r\nhad no embarrassing effects. Neither he nor his neighbors were in the\r\nleast aware that he had been placed thereby in a different intellectual\r\nclass. No doubt this loneliness and sadness of his personal life may be\r\npartly explained by a dumb sense of difference from his fellows; and no\r\ndoubt this very loneliness and sadness intensified the mental\r\npreoccupation which was both the sign and the result of his personal\r\nculture. But his unconsciousness of his own distinction, as well as his\r\nregular participation in political and professional practice, kept his\r\nwill as firm and vigorous as if he were really no more than a man of\r\naction. His natural steadiness of purpose had been toughened in the\r\nbeginning by the hardships and struggles which he shared with his\r\nneighbors; and his self-imposed intellectual discipline in no way\r\nimpaired the stability of his character, because his personal culture\r\nnever alienated him from his neighbors and threw him into a consciously\r\ncritical frame of mind. The time which he spent in intellectual\r\ndiversion may have diminished to some extent his practical efficiency\r\nprevious to the gathering crisis. It certainly made him less inclined to\r\nthe aggressive self-assertion which a successful political career\r\ndemanded. But when the crisis came, when the minds of Northern patriots\r\nwere stirred by the ugly alternative offered to them by the South, and\r\nwhen Lincoln was by the course of events restored to active\r\nparticipation in politics, he soon showed that he had reached the\r\nhighest of all objects of personal culture. While still remaining one of\r\na body of men who, all unconsciously, impoverished their minds in order\r\nto increase the momentum of their practical energy, he none the less\r\nachieved for himself a mutually helpful relation between a firm will and\r\na luminous intelligence. The training of his mind, the awakening of his\r\nimagination, the formation of his taste and style, the humorous\r\ndramatizing of his experience,--all this discipline had failed to\r\npervert his character, narrow his sympathies, or undermine his purposes.\r\nHis intelligence served to enlighten his will, and his will, to\r\nestablish the mature decisions of his intelligence. Late in life the two\r\nfaculties became in their exercise almost indistinguishable. His\r\njudgments, in so far as they were decisive, were charged with momentum,\r\nand his actions were instinct with sympathy and understanding.\r\n\r\nJust because his actions were instinct with sympathy and understanding,\r\nLincoln was certainly the most humane statesman who ever guided a\r\nnation through a great crisis. He always regarded other men and acted\r\ntowards them, not merely as the embodiment of an erroneous or harmful\r\nidea, but as human beings, capable of better things; and consequently\r\nall of his thoughts and actions looked in the direction of a higher\r\nlevel of human association. It is this characteristic which makes him a\r\nbetter and, be it hoped, a more prophetic democrat than any other\r\nnational American leader. His peculiar distinction does not consist in\r\nthe fact that he was a \"Man of the People\" who passed from the condition\r\nof splitting rails to the condition of being President. No doubt he was\r\nin this respect as good a democrat as you please, and no doubt it was\r\ndesirable that he should be this kind of a democrat. But many other\r\nAmericans could be named who were also men of the people, and who passed\r\nfrom the most insignificant to the most honored positions in American\r\nlife. Lincoln's peculiar and permanent distinction as a democrat will\r\ndepend rather upon the fact that his thoughts and his actions looked\r\ntowards the realization of the highest and most edifying democratic\r\nideal. Whatever his theories were, he showed by his general outlook and\r\nbehavior that democracy meant to him more than anything else the spirit\r\nand principle of brotherhood. He was the foremost to deny liberty to the\r\nSouth, and he had his sensible doubts about the equality between the\r\nnegro and the white man; but he actually treated everybody--the Southern\r\nrebel, the negro slave, the Northern deserter, the personal enemy--in a\r\njust and kindly spirit. Neither was this kindliness merely an instance\r\nof ordinary American amiability and good nature. It was the result, not\r\nof superficial feeling which could be easily ruffled, but of his\r\npersonal, moral, and intellectual discipline. He had made for himself a\r\nsecond nature, compact of insight and loving-kindness.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, also, that this higher humanity resided in a man\r\nwho was the human instrument partly responsible for an awful amount of\r\nslaughter and human anguish. He was not only the commander-in-chief of a\r\ngreat army which fought a long and bloody war, but he was the statesman\r\nwho had insisted that, if necessary, the war should be fought. His\r\nmental attitude was dictated by a mixture of practical common sense with\r\ngenuine human insight, and it is just this mixture which makes him so\r\nrare a man and, be it hoped, so prophetic a democrat. He could at one\r\nand the same moment order his countrymen to be killed for seeking to\r\ndestroy the American nation and forgive them for their error. His\r\nkindliness and his brotherly feeling did not lead him, after the manner\r\nof Jefferson, to shirk the necessity and duty of national defense.\r\nNeither did it lead him, after the manner of William Lloyd Garrison, to\r\nadvocate non-resistance, while at the same time arousing in his\r\nfellow-countrymen a spirit of fratricidal warfare. In the midst of that\r\nhideous civil contest which was provoked, perhaps unnecessarily, by\r\nhatred, irresponsibility, passion, and disloyalty, and which has been\r\nthe fruitful cause of national disloyalty down to the present day,\r\nLincoln did not for a moment cherish a bitter or unjust feeling against\r\nthe national enemies. The Southerners, filled as they were with a\r\npassionate democratic devotion to their own interests and liberties,\r\nabused Lincoln until they really came to believe that he was a military\r\ntyrant, yet he never failed to treat them in a fair and forgiving\r\nspirit. When he was assassinated, it was the South, as well as the\r\nAmerican nation, which had lost its best friend, because he alone among\r\nthe Republican leaders had the wisdom to see that the divided House\r\ncould only be restored by justice and kindness; and if there are any\r\ndefects in its restoration to-day, they are chiefly due to the baleful\r\nspirit of injustice and hatred which the Republicans took over from the\r\nAbolitionists.\r\n\r\nHis superiority to his political associates in constructive\r\nstatesmanship is measured by his superiority in personal character.\r\nThere are many men who are able to forgive the enemies of their country,\r\nbut there are few who can forgive their personal enemies. I need not\r\nrehearse the well-known instances of Lincoln's magnanimity. He not only\r\ncherished no resentment against men who had intentionally and even\r\nmaliciously injured him, but he seems at times to have gone out of his\r\nway to do them a service. This is, perhaps, his greatest distinction.\r\nLincoln's magnanimity is the final proof of the completeness of his\r\nself-discipline. The quality of being magnanimous is both the consummate\r\nvirtue and the one which is least natural. It was certainly far from\r\nbeing natural among Lincoln's own people. Americans of his time were\r\ngenerally of the opinion that it was dishonorable to overlook a\r\npersonal injury. They considered it weak and unmanly not to quarrel\r\nwith another man a little harder than he quarreled with you. The pioneer\r\nwas good-natured and kindly; but he was aggressive, quick-tempered,\r\nunreasonable, and utterly devoid of personal discipline. A slight or an\r\ninsult to his personality became in his eyes a moral wrong which must be\r\ncherished and avenged, and which relieved him of any obligation to be\r\njust or kind to his enemy. Many conspicuous illustrations of this\r\nquarrelsome spirit are to be found in the political life of the Middle\r\nPeriod, which, indeed, cannot be understood without constantly falling\r\nback upon the influence of lively personal resentments. Every prominent\r\npolitician cordially disliked or hated a certain number of his political\r\nadversaries and associates; and his public actions were often dictated\r\nby a purpose either to injure these men or to get ahead of them. After\r\nthe retirement of Jackson these enmities and resentments came to have a\r\nsmaller influence; but a man's right and duty to quarrel with anybody\r\nwho, in his opinion, had done him an injury was unchallenged, and was\r\ngenerally considered to be the necessary accompaniment of American\r\ndemocratic virility.\r\n\r\nAs I have intimated above, Andrew Jackson was the most conspicuous\r\nexample of this quarrelsome spirit, and for this reason he is wholly\r\ninferior to Lincoln as a type of democratic manhood. Jackson had many\r\nadmirable qualities, and on the whole he served his country well. He\r\nalso was a \"Man of the People\" who understood and represented the mass\r\nof his fellow-countrymen, and who played the part, according to his\r\nlights, of a courageous and independent political leader. He also loved\r\nand defended the Union. But with all his excellence he should never be\r\nheld up as a model to American youth. The world was divided into his\r\npersonal friends and followers and his personal enemies, and he was as\r\neager to do the latter an injury as he was to do the former a service.\r\nHis quarrels were not petty, because Jackson was, on the whole, a big\r\nrather than a little man, but they were fierce and they were for the\r\nmost part irreconcilable. They bulk so large in his life that they\r\ncannot be overlooked. They stamp him a type of the vindictive man\r\nwithout personal discipline, just as Lincoln's behavior towards Stanton,\r\nChase, and others stamps him a type of the man who has achieved\r\nmagnanimity. He is the kind of national hero the admiring imitation of\r\nwhom can do nothing but good.\r\n\r\nLincoln had abandoned the illusion of his own peculiar personal\r\nimportance. He had become profoundly and sincerely humble, and his\r\nhumility was as far as possible from being either a conventional pose or\r\na matter of nervous self-distrust. It did not impair the firmness of his\r\nwill. It did not betray him into shirking responsibilities. Although\r\nonly a country lawyer without executive experience, he did not flinch\r\nfrom assuming the leadership of a great nation in one of the gravest\r\ncrises of its national history, from becoming commander-in-chief of an\r\narmy of a million men, and from spending $3,000,000,000 in the\r\nprosecution of a war. His humility, that is, was precisely an example of\r\nmoral vitality and insight rather than of moral awkwardness and\r\nenfeeblement. It was the fruit of reflection on his own personal\r\nexperience--the supreme instance of his ability to attain moral truth\r\nboth in discipline and in idea; and in its aspect of a moral truth it\r\nobtained a more explicit expression than did some other of his finer\r\npersonal attributes. His practice of cherishing and repeating the\r\nplaintive little verses which inquire monotonously whether the spirit of\r\nmortal has any right to be proud indicates the depth and the highly\r\nconscious character of this fundamental moral conviction. He is not only\r\nhumble himself, but he feels and declares that men have no right to be\r\nanything but humble; and he thereby enters into possession of the most\r\nfruitful and the most universal of all religious ideas.\r\n\r\nLincoln's humility, no less than his liberal intelligence and his\r\nmagnanimous disposition, is more democratic than it is American; but in\r\nthis, as in so many other cases, his personal moral dignity and his\r\npeculiar moral insight did not separate him from his associates. Like\r\nthem, he wanted professional success, public office, and the ordinary\r\nrewards of American life; and like them, he bears no trace of political\r\nor moral purism. But, unlike them, he was not the intellectual and moral\r\nvictim of his own purposes and ambitions; and unlike them, his life is a\r\ntribute to the sincerity and depth of his moral insight. He could never\r\nhave become a national leader by the ordinary road of insistent and\r\nclamorous self-assertion. Had he not been restored to public life by\r\nthe crisis, he would have remained in all probability a comparatively\r\nobscure and a wholly under-valued man. But the political ferment of 1856\r\nand the threat of ruin overhanging the American Union pushed him again\r\non to the political highway; and once there, his years of intellectual\r\ndiscipline enabled him to play a leading and a decisive part. His\r\npersonality obtained momentum, direction, and increasing dignity from\r\nits identification with great issues and events. He became the\r\nindividual instrument whereby an essential and salutary national purpose\r\nwas fulfilled; and the instrument was admirably effective, precisely\r\nbecause it had been silently and unconsciously tempered and formed for\r\nhigh achievement. Issue as he was of a society in which the cheap tool,\r\nwhether mechanical or personal, was the immediately successful tool, he\r\nhad none the less labored long in the making of a consummate individual\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may protest that I have over-emphasized the\r\ndifference between Lincoln and his contemporary fellow-countrymen. In\r\norder to exalt the leader have I not too much disparaged the followers?\r\nWell, a comparison of this kind always involves the risk of unfairness;\r\nbut if there is much truth in the foregoing estimate of Lincoln, the\r\nlessons of the comparison are worth its inevitable risk. The ordinary\r\ninterpretation of Lincoln as a consummate democrat and a \"Man of the\r\nPeople\" has implied that he was, like Jackson, simply a bigger and a\r\nbetter version of the plain American citizen; and it is just this\r\ninterpretation which I have sought to deny and to expose. In many\r\nrespects he was, of course, very much like his neighbors and associates.\r\nHe accepted everything wholesome and useful in their life and behavior.\r\nHe shared their good-fellowship, their strength of will, their excellent\r\nfaith, and above all their innocence; and he could never have served his\r\ncountry so well, or reached as high a level of personal dignity, in case\r\nhe had not been good-natured and strong and innocent. But, as all\r\ncommentators have noted, he was not only good-natured, strong and\r\ninnocent; he had made himself intellectually candid, concentrated, and\r\ndisinterested, and morally humane, magnanimous, and humble. All these\r\nqualities, which were the very flower of his personal life, were not\r\npossessed either by the average or the exceptional American of his day;\r\nand not only were they not possessed, but they were either wholly\r\nignored or consciously under-valued. Yet these very qualities of high\r\nintelligence, humanity, magnanimity and humility are precisely the\r\nqualities which Americans, in order to become better democrats, should\r\nadd to their strength, their homogeneity, and their innocence; while at\r\nthe same time they are just the qualities which Americans are prevented\r\nby their individualistic practice and tradition from attaining or\r\nproperly valuing. Their deepest convictions make the average\r\nunintelligent man the representative democrat, and the aggressive\r\nsuccessful individual, the admirable national type; and in conformity\r\nwith these convictions their uppermost ideas in respect to Lincoln are\r\nthat he was a \"Man of the People\" and an example of strong will. He was\r\nboth of these things, but his great distinction is that he was also\r\nsomething vastly more and better. He cannot be fully understood and\r\nproperly valued as a national hero without an implicit criticism of\r\nthose traditional convictions. Such a criticism he himself did not and\r\ncould not make. In case he had made it, he could never have achieved his\r\ngreat political task and his great personal triumph. But other times\r\nbring other needs. It is as desirable to-day that the criticism should\r\nbe made explicit as it was that Lincoln himself in his day should\r\npreserve the innocence and integrity of a unique unconscious example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION AND ITS PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognize that the anti-slavery agitation, the\r\nsecession of the South, and the Civil War were, after all, only an\r\nepisode in the course of American national development. The episode was\r\ndesperately serious. Like the acute illness of a strong man, it almost\r\nkilled its victim; and the crisis exposed certain weaknesses in our\r\npolitical organism, in the absence of which the illness would never have\r\nbecome acute. But the roots of our national vitality were apparently\r\nuntouched by the disease. When the crisis was over, the country resumed\r\nwith astonishing celerity the interrupted process of economic expansion.\r\nThe germs of a severe disease, to which the Fathers of the Republic had\r\ngiven a place in the national Constitution, and which had been allowed\r\nto flourish, because of the lack of wholesome cohesion in the body\r\npolitic--this alien growth had been cut out by a drastic surgical\r\noperation, and the robust patient soon recovered something like his\r\nnormal health. Indeed, being in his own opinion even more robust than he\r\nwas before the crisis, he was more eager than ever to convert his good\r\nhealth into the gold of satisfied desire. The ghost of slavery had been\r\nbanished from our national banquet: and, relieved of this terror, the\r\nAmerican people began to show, more aggressively than ever before, their\r\nability to provide and to consume a bountiful feast. They were no longer\r\nchildren, grasping at the first fruits of a half-cultivated wilderness.\r\nThey were adults, beginning to plan the satisfaction of on appetite\r\nwhich had been sharpened by self-denial, and made self-conscious by\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nThe North, after the war was over, did not have much time for serious\r\nreflection upon its meaning and consequences. The Republican leaders did\r\njust enough thinking to carry them through the crisis; but once the\r\nrebellion was suppressed and the South partly de-nationalized in the\r\nname of reconstruction, the need and desire was for action rather than\r\nfor thought. The anti-slavery agitation and the war had interrupted the\r\nprocess, which from the public point of view, was described as the\r\neconomic development of the country, and which from an individual\r\nstandpoint meant the making of money. For many years Americans had been\r\nunable, because of the ghost of slavery, to take full advantage of their\r\nliberties and opportunities; and now that the specter was exorcised,\r\nthey gladly put aside any anxious political preoccupations. Politics\r\ncould be left to the politicians. It was about time to get down to\r\nbusiness. In this happiest of all countries, and under this best of all\r\ngovernments, which had been preserved at such an awful cost, the good\r\nAmerican was entitled to give his undivided attention to the great work\r\nof molding and equipping the continent for human habitation, and\r\nincidentally to the minor task of securing his share of the rewards. A\r\nlively, even a frenzied, outburst of industrial, commercial, and\r\nspeculative activity followed hard upon the restoration of peace. This\r\nactivity and its effects have been the most important fact in American\r\nlife during the forty years which have supervened; and it has assumed\r\nvery different characteristics from those which it had assumed previous\r\nto the War. We must now consider the circumstances, the consequences,\r\nand the meaning of this economic revolution.\r\n\r\nAlthough nobody in 1870 suspected it, the United States was entering\r\nupon a new phase of its economic career; and the new economy was\r\nbringing with it radical social changes. Even before the outbreak of the\r\nCivil War the rich and fertile states of the Middle West had become well\r\npopulated. They had passed from an almost exclusively agricultural\r\neconomy to one which was much more largely urban and industrial. The\r\nfarms had become well-equipped; large cities were being built up;\r\nfactories of various kinds were being established; and most important of\r\nall, the whole industrial organization of the country was being adjusted\r\nto transportation by means of the railroad. An industrial community,\r\nwhich was, comparatively speaking, well-organized and well-furnished\r\nwith machinery, was taking the place of the agricultural community of\r\n1830-1840, which was incoherent and scattered and which lacked\r\neverything except energy and opportunity. Such an increase of\r\norganization, capital, and equipment necessarily modified the outlook\r\nand interests of the people of the Middle West. While still retaining\r\nmany of their local traits, their point of view had been approaching in\r\ncertain respects that of the inhabitants of the East. They had ceased to\r\nbe pioneers.\r\n\r\nDuring the two decades after the Civil War, the territory, which was\r\nstill in the early stage of agricultural development, was the first and\r\nsecond tier of states west of the Mississippi River. Missouri, Iowa, and\r\nMinnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, and finally the Dakotas were being opened\r\nfor settlement; but in their case the effect and symptoms of this\r\ncondition were not the same as they had been with the earlier pioneer\r\nstates. Their economy was from the beginning adjusted to the railroad;\r\nand the railroad had made an essential difference. It worked in favor of\r\na more comprehensive and definite organization and a more complete\r\nequipment. While the business interests of the new states were and still\r\nare predominantly agricultural, the railroads had transformed the\r\noccupation of farming. After 1870, the pioneer farmer was much less\r\ndependent than he had been upon local conditions and markets, and upon\r\nthe unaided exertions of himself and his neighbors. He bought and sold\r\nin the markets of the world. He needed more capital and more machinery.\r\nHe had to borrow money and make shrewd business calculations. From every\r\nstandpoint his economic environment had become more complicated and more\r\nextended, and his success depended much more upon conditions which were\r\nbeyond his control. He never was a pioneer in the sense that the early\r\ninhabitants of the Middle West and South had been pioneers; and he has\r\nnever exercised any corresponding influence upon the American national\r\ntemper. The pioneer had enjoyed his day, and his day was over. The\r\nJack-of-all-trades no longer possessed an important economic function.\r\nThe average farmer was, of course, still obliged to be many kinds of a\r\nrough mechanic, but for the most part he was nothing more than a farmer.\r\nUnskilled labor began to mean labor which was insignificant and badly\r\npaid. Industrial economy demanded the expert with his high and special\r\nstandards of achievement. The railroads and factories could not be\r\nfinanced and operated without the assistance of well-paid and\r\nwell-trained men, who could do one or two things remarkably well, and\r\nwho did not pretend to do much of anything else. These men had to retain\r\ngreat flexibility and an easy adaptability of intelligence, because\r\nAmerican industry and commerce remained very quick in its movements. The\r\nmachinery which they handled was less permanent, and was intended to be\r\nless permanent than the machinery which was considered economical in\r\nEurope. But although they had to avoid routine and business rigidity on\r\nthe penalty of utter failure, still they belonged essentially to a class\r\nof experts. Like all experts, they had to depend, not upon mere energy,\r\nuntutored enthusiasm, and good-will, but upon careful training and\r\nsingle-minded devotion to a special task, and at the same time proper\r\nprovision had to be made for coördinating the results of this highly\r\nspecialized work. More complete organization necessarily accompanied\r\nspecialization. The expert became a part of a great industrial machine.\r\nHis individuality tended to disappear in his work. His interests became\r\nthose of a group. Imperative economic necessities began to classify the\r\nindividuals composing American society in the same way, if not to the\r\nsame extent, that they had been classified in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis was a result which had never entered into the calculations of the\r\npioneer Democrat. He had disliked specialization, because, as he\r\nthought, it narrowed and impoverished the individual; and he distrusted\r\npermanent and official forms of organization, because, as he thought,\r\nthey hampered the individual. His whole political, social, and economic\r\noutlook embodied a society of energetic, optimistic, and prosperous\r\ndemocrats, united by much the same interests, occupations, and point of\r\nview. Each of these democrats was to be essentially an all-round man.\r\nHis conception of all-round manhood was somewhat limited; but it meant\r\nat least a person who was expansive in feeling, who was enough of a\r\nbusiness man successfully to pursue his own interests, and enough of a\r\npolitician to prevent any infringement or perversion of his rights. He\r\nnever doubted that the desired combination of business man, politician,\r\nand good fellow constituted an excellent ideal of democratic\r\nindividuality, that it was sufficiently realized in the average Western\r\nAmerican of the Jacksonian epoch, that it would continue to be the type\r\nof admirable manhood, and that the good democrats embodying this type\r\nwould continue to merit and to obtain substantial and approximately\r\nequal pecuniary rewards. Moreover, for a long time the vision remained\r\nsufficiently true. The typical American democrat described by De\r\nTocqueville corresponded very well with the vision of the pioneer; and\r\nhe did not disappear during the succeeding generation. For many years\r\nmillions of Americans of much the same pattern were rewarded for their\r\ndemocratic virtue in an approximately similar manner. Of course some\r\npeople were poor, and some people were rich; but there was no class of\r\nthe very rich, and the poverty of the poor was generally their own\r\nfault. Opportunity knocked at the door of every man, and the poor man of\r\nto-day was the prosperous householder of to-morrow. For a long time\r\nAmerican social and economic conditions were not merely fluid, but\r\nconsistent and homogeneous, and the vision of the pioneer was fulfilled.\r\nNevertheless, this condition was essentially transient. It contained\r\nwithin itself the seeds of its own dissolution and transformation; and\r\nthis transformation made headway just as soon as, and just as far as,\r\neconomic conditions began to prefer the man who was capable of\r\nspecializing his work, and of organizing it with the work of his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nThe dominant note, consequently, of the pioneer period was an unformed\r\nnational consistency, reached by means of a natural community of feeling\r\nand a general similarity of occupation and well-being. On the other\r\nhand, the dominant note of the period from 1870 until the present day\r\nhas been the gradual disintegration of this early national consistency,\r\nbrought about by economic forces making for specialization and\r\norganization in all practical affairs, for social classification, and\r\nfinally for greater individual distinction. Moreover, the tendency\r\ntowards specialization first began to undermine the very corner-stone of\r\nthe pioneer's democratic edifice. If private interest and public weal\r\nwere to be as harmonious as the pioneer assumed, every economic producer\r\nmust be a practical politician, and there must be no deep-lying division\r\nbetween these primary activities. But the very first result of the\r\nspecializing tendency was to send the man of business, the politician,\r\nand the lawyer off on separate tacks. Business interests became so\r\nabsorbing that they demanded all of a man's time and energy; and he was\r\nobliged to neglect politics except in so far as politics affected\r\nbusiness. In this same way, the successful lawyers after the War were\r\nless apt than formerly to become politicians and statesmen. They left\r\npublic affairs largely to the unsuccessful lawyers. Politics itself\r\nbecame an occupation which made very exacting demands upon a man's time\r\nand upon his conscience. Public service or military success were no\r\nlonger the best roads to public distinction. Men became renowned and\r\ndistinguished quite as much, if not more, for achievements in their\r\nprivate and special occupations. Along with leadership of statesmen and\r\ngenerals, the American people began to recognize that of financiers,\r\n\"captains of industry,\" corporation lawyers, political and labor\r\n\"bosses,\" and these gentlemen assumed extremely important parts in the\r\ndirection of American affairs. Officially, the new leaders were just\r\nlike any other American citizen. No titles could be conferred upon them,\r\nand their position brought with it no necessary public responsibilities.\r\nActually, however, they exercised in many cases more influence upon\r\nAmerican social and political economy than did the official leaders.\r\nThey were an intrusion, into the traditional economic political and\r\nsocial system, for which no provision had been made. Their special\r\ninterests, and the necessities of their special tasks, made their manner\r\nof life different from that of other American citizens, and their\r\npeculiar opportunities enabled them to appropriate an unusually large\r\nshare of the fruits of American economic development. Thus they\r\nseriously impaired the social and economic homogeneity, which the\r\npioneer believed to be the essential quality of fruitful Americanism.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS SPECIALIST\r\n\r\nBefore seeking to trace the consequences and the significance of this\r\nspecialized organization of American practical affairs, we must examine\r\nits origin with some care. An exact and complete understanding thereof\r\nwill in itself afford an unmistakable hint of the way in which its\r\nconsequences are to be appraised, and wherever necessary, corrected. The\r\ngreat and increasing influence of the new unofficial leaders has been\r\ndue not only to economic conditions and to individual initiative, but\r\nto the nature of our political ideas and institutions. The traditional\r\nAmerican theory was that the individual should have a free hand. In so\r\nfar as he was subject to public regulation and control such control\r\nshould be exercised by local authorities, whereof the result would be a\r\nhappy combination of individual prosperity and public weal. But this\r\nexpectation, as we have seen, has proved to be erroneous. While it has,\r\nindeed, resulted in individual prosperity, the individual who has reaped\r\nmost of the prosperity is not the average, but the special man; and\r\nhowever the public may have benefited from the process, the benefit is\r\nmixed with so many drawbacks that, even if it may not be wholly\r\ncondemned, it certainly cannot be wholly approved. The plain fact is\r\nthat the individual in freely and energetically pursuing his own private\r\npurposes has not been the inevitable public benefactor assumed by the\r\ntraditional American interpretation of democracy. No doubt he has\r\nincidentally accomplished, in the pursuit of his own aggrandizement,\r\ncertain manifest public benefits; but wherever public and private\r\nadvantages have conflicted, he has naturally preferred the latter. And\r\nunder our traditional political system there was, until recently, no\r\neffective way of correcting his preference.\r\n\r\nAs long as the economic opportunities of American life consisted chiefly\r\nin the appropriation and improvement of uncultivated land, the average\r\nenergetic man had no difficulty in obtaining his fair share of the\r\nincreasing American economic product; but the time came when such\r\nopportunities, although still important, were dwarfed by other\r\nopportunities, incident to the development of a more mature economic\r\nsystem. These opportunities, which were, of course, connected with the\r\nmanufacturing, industrial, and technical development of the country,\r\ndemanded under American conditions a very special type of man--the man\r\nwho would bring to his task not merely energy, but unscrupulous\r\ndevotion, originality, daring, and in the course of time a large fund of\r\ninstructive experience. The early American industrial conditions\r\ndiffered from those of Europe in that they were fluid, and as a result\r\nof this instability, extremely precarious. Rapid changes in markets,\r\nbusiness methods, and industrial machinery made it very difficult to\r\nbuild up a safe business. A manufacturer or a merchant could not secure\r\nhis business salvation, as in Europe, merely by the adoption of sound\r\nconservative methods. The American business man had greater\r\nopportunities and a freer hand than his European prototype; but he was\r\nalso beset by more severe, more unscrupulous, and more dangerous\r\ncompetition. The industrious and thrifty farmer could be tolerably sure\r\nof a modest competence, due partly to his own efforts, and partly to the\r\nincreased value of his land in a more populous community; but the\r\nbusiness man had no such security. In his case it was war to the knife.\r\nHe was presented with a choice between aggressive daring business\r\noperations, and financial insignificance or ruin.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this situation was due as much to the temper of the American\r\nbusiness man as to his economic environment. American energy had been\r\nconsecrated to economic development. The business man in seeking to\r\nrealize his ambitions and purposes was checked neither by government\r\ncontrol nor social custom. He had nothing to do and nothing to consider\r\nexcept his own business advancement and success. He was eager,\r\nstrenuous, and impatient. He liked the excitement and the risk of large\r\noperations. The capital at his command was generally too small for the\r\nsafe and conservative conduct of his business; and he was consequently\r\nobliged to be adventurous, or else to be left behind in the race. He\r\nmight well be earning enormous profits one year and skirting bankruptcy\r\nthe next. Under such a stress conservatism and caution were suicidal. It\r\nwas the instinct of self-preservation, as well as the spirit of business\r\nadventure, which kept him constantly seeking for larger markets,\r\nimproved methods, or for some peculiar means of getting ahead of his\r\ncompetitors. He had no fortress behind which he could hide and enjoy his\r\nconquests. Surrounded as he was by aggressive enemies and undefended\r\nfrontiers, his best means of security lay in a policy of constant\r\ninnovation and expansion. Moreover, even after he had obtained the\r\nbulwark of sufficient capital and more settled industrial surroundings,\r\nhe was under no temptation to quit and enjoy the spoils of his\r\nconquests. The social, intellectual, or even the more vulgar pleasures,\r\nafforded by leisure and wealth, could bring him no thrill, which was\r\nanything like as intense as that derived from the exercise of his\r\nbusiness ability and power. He could not conquer except by virtue of a\r\nstrong, tenacious, adventurous, and unscrupulous will; and after he had\r\nconquered, this will had him in complete possession. He had nothing to\r\ndo but to play the game to the end--even though his additional profits\r\nwere of no living use to him.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the fluid and fluctuating nature of American economic\r\nconditions and the fierceness of American competitive methods turned\r\nbusiness into a state of dangerous and aggressive warfare, the steady\r\nand enormous expansion of the American markets made the rewards of\r\nvictory correspondingly great. Not only was the population of the\r\ncountry increasing at an enormous rate, but the demand for certain\r\nnecessary products, services, and commodities was increasing at a higher\r\nrate than the population. The American people were still a most\r\nhomogeneous collection of human beings. They wanted very much the same\r\nthings; they wanted more of these things year after year; and they\r\nimmediately rewarded any cheapening of the product by buying it in much\r\nlarger quantities. The great business opportunities of American life\r\nconsisted, consequently, in supplying some popular or necessary article\r\nor service at a cheaper price than that at which any one else could\r\nfurnish it; and the great effort of American business men was, of\r\ncourse, to obtain some advantage over their competitors in producing\r\nsuch an article or in supplying such a service. The best result of this\r\ncondition was a constant improvement in the mechanism of production.\r\nCheapness was found to depend largely upon the efficient use of\r\nmachinery, and the efficient use of machinery was found to depend upon\r\nconstant wear and quick replacement by a better machine. But while the\r\neconomic advantage of the exhausting use and the constant improvement of\r\nmachinery was the most important economic discovery of the American\r\nbusiness man, he was also encouraged by his surroundings to seek\r\neconomies in other and less legitimate ways. It was all very well to\r\nmultiply machines and make them more efficient, but similar improvements\r\nwere open to competitors. The great object was to obtain some advantage\r\nwhich was denied to your competitors. Then the business man could not\r\nonly secure his own position, but utterly rout and annihilate his\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\nAt this point the railroads came to the assistance of the aggressive and\r\nunscrupulous business man. They gave such men an advantage over their\r\ncompetitors by granting them special rates; and inasmuch as this\r\npractice has played a decisive part in American business development,\r\nits effect and its meaning, frequently as they have been pointed out,\r\nmust be carefully traced.\r\n\r\nThe railroads themselves are, perhaps, the most perfect illustration of\r\nthe profits which accrue in a rapidly growing country from the\r\npossession of certain advantages in supplying to the public an\r\nindispensable service. They were not built, as in most European states,\r\nunder national supervision and regulation, or according to a general\r\nplan which prevented unnecessary competition. Their routes and their\r\nmethods were due almost entirely to private enterprise and to local\r\neconomic necessities. They originated in local lines radiating from\r\nlarge cities; and only very slowly did their organization come to\r\ncorrespond with the great national routes of trade. The process of\r\nbuilding up the leading systems was in the beginning a process of\r\ncombining the local roads into important trunk lines. Such combinations\r\nwere enormously profitable, because the business of the consolidated\r\nroads increased in a much larger proportion than did the cost of\r\nfinancing end operating the larger mileage; and after the combinations\r\nwere made the owners of the consolidated road were precisely in the\r\nposition of men who had obtained a certain strategic advantage in\r\nsupplying a necessary service to their fellow-countrymen. Their\r\nterminals, rights of way, and machinery could not be duplicated except\r\nat an increased cost, and their owners were in a position necessarily to\r\nbenefit from the growth of the country in industry and population. No\r\ndoubt their economic position was in certain respects precarious. They\r\ndid not escape the necessity, to which other American business\r\nenterprises had to submit, of fighting for a sufficient share of the\r\nspoils. But in making the fight, they had acquired certain advantages\r\nwhich, if they were intelligently used, would necessarily result in\r\nvictory; and as we all know, these advantages have proved to be\r\nsufficient. The railroads have been the greatest single source of large\r\nAmerican fortunes, and the men who control the large railroad systems\r\nare the most powerful and conspicuous American industrial leaders.\r\n\r\nImportant, however, as has been the direct effect of big railroad\r\nsystems on the industrial economy of the country, their indirect effects\r\nhave probably been even more important. In one way or another, they have\r\nbeen the most effective of all agencies working for the larger\r\norganization of American industries. Probably such an organization was\r\nbound to have come in any event, because the standard economic needs of\r\nmillions of thrifty democrats could in the long run be most cheaply\r\nsatisfied by means of well-situated and fully equipped industrial plants\r\nof the largest size; but the railroad both hastened this result and\r\ndetermined its peculiar character. The population of the United States\r\nis so scattered, its distances so huge, and its variations in\r\ntopographical level so great, that its industries would necessarily have\r\nremained very local in character, as long as its system of\r\ntransportation depended chiefly upon waterways and highways. Some kind\r\nof quick transportation across country was, consequently, an\r\nindispensable condition of the national organization of American\r\nindustry and commerce. The railroad not only supplied this need, but\r\ncoming as it did pretty much at the beginning of our industrial\r\ndevelopment, it largely modified and determined the character thereof.\r\nBy considerably increasing the area within which the products of any one\r\nlocality could be profitably sold, it worked naturally in favor of the\r\nconcentration of a few large factories in peculiarly favorable\r\nlocations; and this natural process was accelerated by the policy which\r\nthe larger companies adopted in the making of their rates. The rapid\r\ngrowth of big producing establishments was forced, because of the\r\nrebates granted to them by the railroads. Without such rebates the large\r\nmanufacturing corporation controlled by a few individuals might still\r\nhave come into existence; but these individuals would have been neither\r\nas powerful as they now are, nor as opulent, nor as much subject to\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiarly desirable to understand, consequently, just how these\r\nrebates came to be granted. It was, apparently, contrary to the interest\r\nof the railroad companies to cut their rates for the benefit of any one\r\nclass of customers; and it was, also, an illegal practice, which had to\r\nbe carried on by secret and underhand methods. Almost all the state laws\r\nunder which corporations engaged in transportation had been organized,\r\nhad defined railways, like highways, as public necessities. Such\r\ncorporations had usually been granted by the states the power to condemn\r\nland,--and the delegation of such a power to a private company meant, of\r\ncourse, that it owed certain responsibilities to the public as a common\r\ncarrier, among which the responsibility of not allowing special\r\nprivileges to any one customer was manifestly to be included. When the\r\nrailroad managers have been asked why they cut their published rates and\r\nevaded the laws, they have always contended that they were forced to do\r\nso; and whatever may be thought of the plea, it cannot be lightly set\r\naside. As we have seen, the trunk lines leading from Chicago to the\r\ncoast were the result of the consolidation of local roads. After the\r\nconsolidations had taken place, these companies began to compete\r\nfiercely for through freight, and the rebates were an incident in this\r\ncompetition. The trunk lines in the early years of their existence were\r\nin the position of many other American business enterprises. For the\r\ntime being, they were more than competent to carry all the freight\r\noffered at competitive points. Inasmuch as there was not enough to go\r\naround, they fought mercilessly for what business there was. When a\r\nlarge individual shipper was prepared to guarantee them a certain amount\r\nof freight in return for special rates, they were obliged either to\r\ngrant the rates or to lose the business. Of course they submitted, and\r\ndefended their submission as a measure of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nNo great intelligence is required to detect in this situation the\r\nevidence of a vicious circle. The absorption of Americans in business\r\naffairs, and the free hand which the structure and ideals of American\r\nlife granted them, had made business competition a fierce and merciless\r\naffair; while at the same time the fluid nature of American economic\r\nconditions made success very precarious. Every shrewd and resolute man\r\nwould seek to secure himself against the dangers of this situation by\r\nmeans of special advantages, and the most effective of all special\r\nadvantages would, of course, be special railroad rates. But a shipper\r\nsuch as John D. Rockefeller could obtain special rates only because the\r\nrailroads were in a position similar to his own, and were fighting\r\nstrenuously for supremacy. The favored shipper and the railroad both\r\nexcused themselves on the ground of self-preservation, and sometimes\r\neven claimed that it was just for a large shipper to obtain better rates\r\nthan a small one. This was all very well for the larger shipper and the\r\nrailroad, but in the meantime what became of the small shipper, whom Mr.\r\nRockefeller was enabled to annihilate by means of his contracts with the\r\nrailroad companies? The small shipper saw himself forced out of\r\nbusiness, because corporations to whom the state had granted special\r\nprivileges as common carriers, had a private interest in doing business\r\nwith his bigger, more daring, and unscrupulous competitors.\r\n\r\nOf course no such result could have happened, if at any point in this\r\nvicious circle of private interests, there had been asserted a dominant\r\npublic interest; and there are several points at which such an interest\r\nmight well have been intruded. The circle would have been broken, if,\r\nfor instance, the granting of illegal rebates had been effectively\r\nprohibited; but as a matter of fact they could not be effectively\r\nprohibited by the public authorities, to whom either the railroads or\r\nthe large shippers were technically responsible. A shipper of oil in\r\nCleveland, Ohio, would have a difficult time in protesting against\r\nillegal discrimination on the part of a railroad conducting an\r\ninter-state business and organized under the laws of New York. No doubt\r\nhe could appeal to the Federal government; but the Federal government\r\nhad been, for the time being, disqualified by many different causes from\r\neffective interference. In the first place there was to be overcome the\r\nconventional democratic prejudice against what was called\r\ncentralization. A tradition of local control over the machinery of\r\ntransit and transportation was dominant during the early period of\r\nrailroad construction. The fact that railways would finally become the\r\nall-important vehicles of inter-state commerce was either overlooked or\r\nconsidered unimportant. The general government did not interfere--except\r\nwhen, as in the case of the Pacific lines, its interference and\r\nassistance were solicited by private interests. For a long time the idea\r\nthat the Federal government had any general responsibility in respect to\r\nthe national transportation system was devoid of practical consequences.\r\n\r\nIn the end an Inter-state Commerce law was passed, in which the\r\npresence of a national interest in respect to the American system of\r\ntransportation was recognized. But this law, like our tariff laws, was\r\nframed for the benefit chiefly of a combination of local and special\r\ninterests; and it served little to advance any genuine national interest\r\nin relation to the railroads. To be sure it did forbid rebates, but the\r\nmachinery for enforcing the prohibition was inefficient, and during\r\nanother twenty years the prohibition remained substantially a dead\r\nletter. The provisions of the law forbidding rebates were in truth\r\nmerely a bit of legal hypocrisy. Rebates could not be openly defended;\r\nbut the business of the country was honeycombed with them, and the\r\nmajority of the shippers in whose interest the law was passed did not\r\nwant the prohibition enforced. Their influence at Washington was\r\nsufficiently powerful to prevent the adoption of any effective measures\r\nfor the abatement of the evil. The Federal Inter-state Commerce\r\nCommission, unlike the local authorities, would have been fully\r\ncompetent to abolish rebates; but the plain truth was that the effective\r\npublic opinion in the business world either supported the evil or\r\nconnived at it. The private interests at stake were, for the time being,\r\ntoo strong for the public interest. The whole American business\r\ntradition was opposed to government interference with prevailing\r\nbusiness practices; and in view of this fact the responsibility for the\r\nrebates cannot be fixed merely upon the railroads and the trusts. The\r\nAmerican system had licensed energetic and unscrupulous individual\r\naggrandizement as the best means of securing a public benefit; and\r\nrebates were merely a flagrant instance of the extent to which public\r\nopinion permitted the domination of private interests.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Federal government to protect the public interest in\r\na matter over which the state governments had no effective control, has\r\ngreatly accelerated the organization of American industries on a\r\nnational scale, but for private and special purposes. Certain\r\nindividuals controlling certain corporations were enabled to obtain a\r\ndecided advantage in supplying certain services and products to the\r\nenormously increasing American market; and once those individuals and\r\ncorporations had obtained dominant positions, it was in their interest\r\nto strengthen one another's hands in every possible way. One big\r\ncorporation has as a rule preferred to do business with another big\r\ncorporation. They were all of them producing some standard commodity or\r\nservice, and it is part of the economical conduct of such businesses to\r\nbuy and sell so far as possible in large quantities and under long\r\ncontracts. Such contracts reduced to a comparatively low level the\r\nnecessary uncertainties of business. It enabled the managers of these\r\ncorporations to count upon a certain market for their product or a\r\ncertain cost for part of their raw material; and it must be remembered\r\nthat the chief object of this whole work of industrial organization was\r\nto diminish the hazards of unregulated competition and to subject large\r\nbusiness operations to effective control. A conspicuous instance of the\r\neffect of such interests and motives may be seen in the lease of the ore\r\nlands belonging to the Great Northern Railroad to the United States\r\nSteel Corporation. The railroad company owned the largest body of good\r\nore in the country outside of the control of the Steel Corporation, and\r\nif these lands had been leased to many small companies, the ability of\r\nthe independent steel manufacturers to compete with the big steel\r\ncompany would have been very much increased. But the Great Northern\r\nRailroad Company found it simpler and more secure to do business with\r\none large than a number of small companies; and in this way the Steel\r\nCorporation has obtained almost a monopoly of the raw material most\r\nnecessary to the production of finished steel. It will be understood,\r\nconsequently, how inevitably these big corporations strengthen one\r\nanother's hands; and it must be added that they had political as well as\r\neconomic motives for so doing. Although the big fellows sometimes\r\nindulge in the luxury of fierce fighting, such fights are always the\r\nprelude to still closer agreements. They are all embarked in the same\r\nboat; and surrounded as they are by an increasing amount of enmity,\r\nprovoked by their aggrandizement, they have every reason to lend one\r\nanother constant and effective support.\r\n\r\nThere may be discerned in this peculiar organization of American\r\nindustry an entangling alliance between a wholesome and a baleful\r\ntendency. The purpose which prompted men like John D. Rockefeller to\r\nescape from the savage warfare in which so many American business men\r\nwere engaged, was in itself a justifiable and ameliorating purpose.\r\nCompetition in American business was insufficiently moderated either by\r\nthe state or by the prevailing temper of American life. No sensible and\r\nresourceful man will submit to such a precarious existence without\r\nmaking some attempt to escape from it; and if the means which Mr.\r\nRockefeller and others took to secure themselves served to make the\r\nbusiness lives of their competitors still more precarious, such a result\r\nwas only the expiation which American business men were obliged to pay\r\nfor their own excesses. The concentrated leadership, the partial\r\ncontrol, the thorough organization thereby effected, was not necessarily\r\na bad thing. It was in some respects a decidedly good thing, because\r\nleadership of any kind has certain intrinsic advantages. The trusts have\r\ncertainly succeeded in reducing the amount of waste which was\r\nnecessitated by the earlier condition of wholly unregulated competition.\r\nThe competitive methods of nature have been, and still are, within\r\nlimits indispensable; but the whole effort of civilization has been to\r\nreduce the area within which they are desirably effective; and it is\r\nentirely possible that in the end the American system of industrial\r\norganization will constitute a genuine advance in industrial economy.\r\nLarge corporations, which can afford the best machinery; which control\r\nabundant capital, and which can plan with scrupulous economy all the\r\ndetails of producing and selling an important product or service, are\r\nactually able to reduce the cost of production to a minimum; and in the\r\ncases of certain American corporations such results have actually been\r\nachieved. The new organization of American industry has created an\r\neconomic mechanism which is capable of being wonderfully and\r\nindefinitely serviceable to the American people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, its serviceability is much diminished by the special\r\nopportunities it gives a few individuals. These opportunities do not\r\namount in any case to a monopoly, but they do amount to a species of\r\neconomic privilege which enable them to wring profits from the\r\nincreasing American market disproportionate to the value of their\r\neconomic services. What is still more unfortunate, however, is the\r\nequivocal position of these big corporations in respect to the laws\r\nunder which they are organized, and in respect to the public\r\nauthorities which are supposed to control them. Many of the large\r\nrailway and industrial corporations have reached their present size\r\npartly by an evasion or a defiance of the law. Their organizers took\r\nadvantage of the American system of local self-government and the\r\nAmerican disposition to reduce the functions of the Federal government\r\nto a minimum--they took advantage of these legal conditions and\r\npolitical ideas to organize an industrial machinery which cannot be\r\neffectively reached by local statutes and officials. The favorable\r\ncorporation laws of some states have been used as a means of preying\r\nupon the whole country; and the unfavorable corporation laws of other\r\nstates have been practically nullified. The big corporations have proved\r\nto be too big and powerful for the laws and officials to which the\r\nAmerican political system has subjected them; and their equivocal legal\r\nposition has resulted in the corruption of American public life and in\r\nthe serious deterioration of our system of local government.\r\n\r\nThe net result of the industrial expansion of the United States since\r\nthe Civil War has been the establishment in the heart of the American\r\neconomic and social system of certain glaring inequalities of condition\r\nand power. The greater American railroad and industrial corporations\r\ncontrol resources and conduct operations on a scale unprecedented in the\r\neconomic history of the world. The great American industrial leaders\r\nhave accumulated fortunes for which there is also no precedent on the\r\npart of men who exercise no official political power. These inequalities\r\nare the result of the organization of American industry on almost a\r\nnational scale,--an organization which was brought about as a means of\r\nescape from the intolerable evils of unregulated competition. Every\r\naspect of American business methods has helped to make them inevitable,\r\nand the responsibility for them must be distributed over the whole\r\nbusiness and social fabric. But in spite of the fact that they have\r\noriginated as the inevitable result of American business methods and\r\npolitical ideas and institutions, they constitute a serious problem for\r\na democracy to face; and this problem has many different aspects. Its\r\nmost serious aspect is constituted by the sheer size of the resulting\r\ninequalities. The rich men and the big corporations have become too\r\nwealthy and powerful for their official standing in American life. They\r\nhave not obeyed the laws. They have attempted to control the official\r\nmakers, administrators, and expounders of the law. They have done little\r\nto allay and much to excite the resentment and suspicion. In short,\r\nwhile their work has been constructive from an economic and industrial\r\nstandpoint, it has made for political corruption and social\r\ndisintegration. Children, as they are, of the traditional American\r\nindividualistic institutions, ideas, and practices, they have turned on\r\ntheir parents and dealt them an ugly wound. Either these economic\r\nmonsters will destroy the system of ideas, institutions, and practices\r\nout of which they have issued or else be destroyed by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLITICAL SPECIALIST\r\n\r\nThe corporations were able to secure and to exercise an excessive and\r\ncorrupt influence on legislation, because their aggrandizement coincided\r\nwith a process of deterioration in our local political institutions. We\r\nhave seen that the stress of economic competition had specialized the\r\nAmerican business man and made him almost exclusively preoccupied with\r\nthe advancement of his own private interests; and one of the first\r\nresults of this specialization was an alteration in his attitude towards\r\nthe political welfare of his country. Not only did he no longer give as\r\nmuch time to politics as he formerly did, but as his business increased\r\nin size and scope, he found his own interests by way of conflicting at\r\nmany points with the laws of his country and with its well-being. He did\r\nnot take this conflict very seriously. He was still reflected in the\r\nmirror of his own mind as a patriotic and a public-spirited citizen; but\r\nat the same time his ambition was to conquer, and he did not scruple to\r\nsacrifice both the law and the public weal to his own prosperity. All\r\nunknowingly he began to testify to a growing and a decisive division\r\nbetween the two primary interests of American life,--between the\r\ninterest of the individual business man and the interest of the body\r\npolitic; and he became a living refutation of the amiable theories of\r\nthe Jacksonian Democrat that the two must substantially coincide. The\r\nbusiness man had become merely a business man, and the conditions which\r\nhad made him less of a politician had also had its effect upon the men\r\nwhose business was that of politics. Just as business had become\r\nspecialized and organized, so politics also became subject to\r\nspecialization and organization. The appearance of the \"Captain of\r\nIndustry\" was almost coincident with the appearance of the \"Boss.\"\r\n\r\nThere has been a disposition to treat the \"Boss\" chiefly as the\r\npolitical creature of the corrupt corporation; and it is undoubtedly\r\ntrue that one of the most important functions of the municipal and state\r\n\"Bosses\" has been that of conducting negotiations with the corporations.\r\nBut to consider the specialized organization of our local politics as\r\nthe direct result of specialized organization of American business is\r\nwholly to misunderstand its significance. The two processes are the\r\nparallel effects of the same conditions and ideas working in different\r\nfields. Business efficiency under the conditions prevailing in our\r\npolitical and economic fabric demanded the \"Captain of Industry.\"\r\nPolitical efficiency under our system of local government demanded the\r\n\"Boss.\" The latter is an independent power who has his own special\r\nreasons for existence. He put in an embryonic appearance long before the\r\nlarge corporations had obtained anything like their existing power in\r\nAmerican politics; and he will survive in some form their reduction to\r\npolitical insignificance. He has been a genuine and within limits a\r\nuseful product of the American democracy; and it would be fatal either\r\nto undervalue or to misunderstand him.\r\n\r\nThe American system of local self-government encouraged the creation of\r\nthe political \"Boss,\" because it required such an enormous amount of\r\npolitical business. Some one was needed to transact this business, and\r\nthe professional politician was developed to supply the need. There was\r\nno reason why such a need should have existed; because the amount of\r\npolitical business incident to state government could have been very\r\nmuch economized by a simpler method of organization. But American\r\ndemocratic ideas during the years when the state governments took form\r\nwere wholly opposed to simplicity of organization. The state\r\nconstitutions adopted during the period of Jacksonian supremacy seem\r\ndesigned to make local government costly in time and energy and\r\nirresponsible in action; and they provided the legal scenery in the\r\nmidst of which the professional politician became the only effective\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nThe state constitutions were all very much influenced by the Federal\r\ninstrument, but in the copies many attempts were made to improve upon\r\nthe model. The Democracy had come to believe that the Federal\r\nConstitution tended to encourage independence and even special\r\nefficiency on the part of Federal officials; and it proposed to correct\r\nsuch an erroneous tendency in the more thoroughly democratic state\r\ngovernments. No attempt was, indeed, made to deprive the executive and\r\nthe judicial officials of independence by making them the creatures of\r\nthe legislative branch; for such a change, although conforming to\r\nearlier democratic ideas, would have looked in the direction of a\r\nconcentration of responsibility. The far more insidious course was\r\nadopted of keeping the executive, the judicial, and the legislative\r\nbranches of the government technically separate, while at the same time\r\ndepriving all three of any genuine independence and efficiency. The term\r\nof the executive, for instance, was not allowed to exceed one or two\r\nyears. The importance of his functions was diminished. His power of\r\nappointment was curtailed. Many of his most important executive\r\nassistants were elected by popular vote and made independent of him. In\r\nsome few instances he was even deprived of a qualified veto upon\r\nlegislation. But the legislature itself was not treated much better.\r\nInstead of deriving its power from a short constitution which conferred\r\nupon it full legislative responsibilities and powers, the tendency has\r\nbeen to incorporate an enormous mass of special and detailed legislation\r\nin the fundamental law, and so to diminish indefinitely the power of the\r\nlegislative branch either to be useful or dangerous. Finally state\r\njudges instead of being appointed for life were usually elected for\r\nlimited terms, so that they could scarcely avoid being more \"amenable to\r\npublic opinion.\" The tendency in every respect was to multiply elections\r\nand elective officials, divide responsibility and power, and destroy\r\nindependence. The more \"democratic\" these constitutions became, the more\r\nclearly the Democracy showed its disposition to distrust its own\r\nrepresentatives, and to deprive them of any chance of being genuinely\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Jacksonion Democrat in framing constitutions of this\r\nkind was to keep political power in the hands of the \"plain people,\" and\r\nto forestall the domination of administrative and legislative\r\nspecialists. The effect was precisely the opposite. They afforded the\r\npolitical specialist a wonderful opportunity. The ordinary American\r\ncould not pretend to give as much time to politics as the smooth\r\noperation of this complicated machine demanded; and little by little\r\nthere emerged in different parts of the country a class of politicians\r\nwho spent all their time in nominating and electing candidates to these\r\nnumerous offices. The officials so elected, instead of being responsible\r\nto the people, were responsible to the men to whom they owed their\r\noffices; and their own individual official power was usually so small\r\nthat they could not put what little independence they possessed to any\r\ngood use. As a matter of fact, they used their official powers chiefly\r\nfor the benefit of their creators. They appointed to office the men whom\r\nthe \"Bosses\" selected. They passed the measures which the machine\r\ndemanded. In this way the professional politician gradually obtained a\r\nstock of political goods wherewith to maintain and increase his power.\r\nReënforced by the introduction of the spoils system first into the state\r\nand then into the Federal civil services, a process of local political\r\norganization began after 1830 to make rapid headway. Local leaders\r\nappeared in different parts of the country who little by little relieved\r\nthe farmer and the business man of the cares and preoccupations of\r\ngovernment. In the beginning the most efficient of these politicians\r\nwere usually Jacksonian Democrats, and they ruled both in the name of\r\nthe people and by virtue of a sturdy popular following. They gradually\r\nincreased in power, until in the years succeeding the war they became\r\nthe dominant influence in local American politics, and had won the right\r\nto be called something which they would never have dared to call\r\nthemselves, viz. a governing class.\r\n\r\nWhile the local \"Boss\" nearly always belonged to the political party\r\ndominant in his neighborhood, so that he could in ordinary elections\r\ndepend upon the regular party vote, still the real source of his power\r\nconsisted in a band of personal retainers; and the means by which such\r\ngroups were collected and held together contain a curious mixture of\r\ncorruption and democracy. In the first place the local leader had to be\r\na \"good fellow\" who lived in the midst of his followers and knew all\r\nabout them. His influence was entirely dependent upon personal\r\nkindliness, loyalty, and good-comradeship. He was socially the playmate\r\nand the equal of his followers, and the relations among them were\r\ncharacterized by many admirable qualities. The group was within limits a\r\ngenuine example of social democracy, and was founded on mutual\r\nunderstanding, good-will, and assistance. The leader used his official\r\nand unofficial power to obtain jobs for his followers. He succored them\r\nwhen in need; he sometimes protected them against the invidious activity\r\nof the police or the prosecuting attorneys; he provided excursions and\r\npicnics for them in hot weather; he tied them to himself by a thousand\r\nbonds of interest and association; he organized them into a clan, who\r\nsupported him blindly at elections in return for a deal of personal\r\nkindliness and a multitude of small services; he became their genuine\r\nrepresentative, whether official or not, because he represented their\r\nmost vital interests and satisfied their most pressing and intimate\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nThe general method of political organization indicated above was\r\nperfected in the two decades succeeding the Civil War. The American\r\ndemocracy was divided politically into a multitude of small groups,\r\norganized chiefly for the purpose of securing the local and individual\r\ninterests of these groups and their leaders, and supported by local and\r\npersonal feeling, political patronage, and petty \"graft.\" These groups\r\nwere associated with both parties, and merely made the use of partisan\r\nties and cries to secure the coöperation of more disinterested voters.\r\nThe result was that so far as American political representation was\r\nmerely local, it was generally corrupt, and it was always selfish. The\r\nleader's power depended absolutely on an appeal to the individual,\r\nneighborhood, and class interests of his followers. They were the\r\n\"people\"; he was the popular tribune. He could not retain his power for\r\na month, in case he failed to subordinate every larger interest to the\r\nflattery, cajolery, and nourishment of his local clan. Thus the local\r\nrepresentative system was poisoned at its source. The alderman, the\r\nassemblyman, or the congressman, even if he were an honest man,\r\nrepresented little more than the political powers controlling his\r\ndistrict; and to be disinterested in local politics was usually\r\nequivalent to being indifferent.\r\n\r\nAlthough these local clans were the basis of American political\r\norganization, they were not, of course, its ultimate fruit. In many of\r\nthe cities, large and small, and in some of the states the leaders of\r\nthe local groups were subordinated to one of their number who became the\r\nreal \"Boss\" and who strengthened the district organizations by using for\r\ntheir benefit the municipal, state, and Federal patronage. The relation\r\nof the municipal or state \"Boss\" to the district leaders was similar to\r\nthe relation which the district leader bore to his more important\r\nretainers. The \"Boss\" first obtained his primacy by means of diplomatic\r\nskill or force of character; and his ability to retain it depended upon\r\nhis ability to satisfy the demands of the district leaders for\r\npatronage, while at the same time leading the organization to victory in\r\nthe local elections. His special duties as \"Boss\" required personal\r\nprestige, strength of will, power of persuasive talking, good judgment\r\nof men, loyalty to his promises and his followers, and a complete lack\r\nof scruple. Unlike the district leader, however, the municipal \"Boss\"\r\nhas tended to become a secretive and somewhat lonely person, who carried\r\non his business behind closed doors, and on whom was visited the odium\r\nincurred by this whole system of political organization. The district\r\nleader either does not incur or is less affected by this odium, because\r\nhis social status is precisely that of his followers. The \"Boss,\" on the\r\nother hand, by this wealth and public position would naturally be an\r\nimportant member of the society in which he lives, whereas as a matter\r\nof fact he has come to be ostracized because of the source of his power\r\nand wealth. His leadership over-reached the district clan, which was\r\nreal social basis; and the consequence was that the \"Boss\" became, to\r\nall appearances, a very unpopular man in the democracy which he ruled.\r\n\r\nHis secretiveness and his unpopularity point to one of the most\r\nimportant functions of the municipal and state \"Bosses,\" to which as yet\r\nonly incidental reference has been made. The \"Boss\" became the man who\r\nnegotiated with the corporations, and through whom they obtained what\r\nthey wanted. We have already seen that the large corporation,\r\nparticularly those owning railroad and municipal franchises, have found\r\nthat the purchase of a certain amount of political power was a necessary\r\nconsequence of their dubious legal position. A traffic of this kind was\r\nnot one, of course, to which many people could be admitted. It must be\r\ntransmitted in secret, and by people who possessed full authority. An\r\nagreement to secure certain franchises or certain needed legislation in\r\nreturn for certain personal or party favors was not an agreement which\r\ncould be made between a board of directors and a group of district\r\nleaders. If a large number of people were familiar with the details of\r\nsuch negotiations, something more than a hint thereof would be sure to\r\nleak out; and unquestionably the fact that a traffic of this kind was\r\npart of the political game had much to do with the ability of the\r\nmunicipal or state \"Boss\" to obtain and to keep his power. The profits\r\nnot only enabled him to increase party funds and to line his own\r\npockets, but it also furnished him with a useful and abundant source of\r\npatronage. He could get positions for the political henchmen of his\r\ndistrict leaders, not only with the local and state governments, but\r\nwith the corporations. Thus every \"Boss,\" even those whose influence did\r\nnot extend beyond an election district, was more or less completely\r\nidentified with the corporations who occupied within his bailiwick any\r\nimportant relation to the state.\r\n\r\nThis alliance between the political machines and the big\r\ncorporations--particularly those who operate railroads or control\r\nmunicipal franchises--was an alliance between two independent and\r\ncoördinate powers in the kingdom of American practical affairs. The\r\npolitical \"Boss\" did not create the industrial leader for his own good\r\npurposes. Neither did the industrial leader create the machine and its\r\n\"Boss,\" although he has done much to confirm the latter's influence.\r\nEach of them saw an opportunity to turn to his own account the\r\nindividualistic \"freedom\" of American politics and industry. Each of\r\nthem was enabled by the character of our political traditions to obtain\r\nan amount of power which the originators of those political ideas never\r\nanticipated, and which, if not illegal, was entirely outside the law.\r\nIt so happened that the kind of power which each obtained was very\r\nuseful to the other. A corporation which derived its profits from public\r\nfranchises, or from a business transacted in many different states,\r\nfound the purchase of a local or state machine well within its means and\r\nwell according to its interests. The professional politicians who had\r\nembarked in politics as a business and who were making what they could\r\nout of it for themselves and their followers, could not resist this\r\nunexpected and lucrative addition to their market. But it must be\r\nremembered that the alliance was founded on interest rather than\r\nassociation, on mutual agreement rather than on any effective\r\nsubordination one to another. A certain change in conditions might\r\neasily make their separate interests diverge, and abstract all the\r\nprofits from their traffic. If anything happened, for instance, to make\r\ninter-state railroad corporations less dependent on the state\r\ngovernments, they would no longer need the expense of subsidizing the\r\nstate machines. There are signs at the present time that these interests\r\nare diverging, and that such alliances will be less dangerous in the\r\nfuture than they have been in the past. But even if the alliance is\r\nbroken, the peculiar unofficial organization of American industry and\r\npolitics will persist, and will constitute, both in its consequences and\r\nits significance, two of our most important national problems.\r\n\r\nIt would be as grave a mistake, however, absolutely to condemn this\r\nprocess of political organization as it would absolutely to condemn the\r\nprocess of industrial organization. The huge corporation and the\r\npolitical machine were both created to satisfy a real and a permanent\r\nneed--the needs of specialized leadership and associated action in these\r\ntwo primary American activities. That in both of these cases the actual\r\nmethod of organization has threatened vital public interests, and even\r\nthe very future of democracy has been due chiefly to the disregard by\r\nthe official American political system of the necessity and the\r\nconsequences of specialized leadership and associated action. The\r\npolitical system was based on the assumption that the individualism it\r\nencouraged could be persuaded merely by the power of words to respect\r\nthe public interest, that public officials could be deprived of\r\nindependence and authority for the real benefit of the \"plain people,\"\r\nand that the \"plain people\" would ask nothing from the government but\r\ntheir legal rights. These assumptions were all erroneous; and when\r\nassociated action and specialized leadership became necessary in local\r\nAmerican politics, the leaders and their machine took advantage of the\r\ndefective official system to build up an unofficial system, better\r\nsuited to actual popular needs. The \"people\" wanted the government to do\r\nsomething for them, and the politicians made their living and served\r\ntheir country by satisfying the want. To be sure, the \"people\" they\r\nbenefited were a small minority of the whole population whose interests\r\nwere far from being the public interest; but it was none the less\r\nnatural that the people, whoever they were, should want the government\r\nto do more for them than to guarantee certain legal rights, and it was\r\ninevitable that they should select leaders who could satisfy their\r\npositive, if selfish, needs.\r\n\r\nThe consequence has been, however, a separation of actual political\r\npower from official political responsibility. The public officers are\r\nstill technically responsible for the good government of the states,\r\neven if, as individuals, they have not been granted the necessary\r\nauthority effectively to perform their task. But their actual power is\r\neven smaller than their official authority. They are almost completely\r\ncontrolled by the machine which secures their election or appointment.\r\nThe leader or leaders of that machine are the rulers of the community,\r\neven though they occupy no offices and cannot be held in any way\r\npublicly responsible. Here, again, as in the case of the\r\nmulti-millionaire, we have an example of a dangerous inequality in the\r\ndistribution of power, and one which tends to maintain and perpetuate\r\nitself. The professional politician is frequently beaten and is being\r\nvigorously fought; but he himself understands how necessary he is under\r\nthe existing local political organization, and how difficult it will be\r\nto dislodge him. Beaten though he be again and again, he constantly\r\nrecovers his influence, because he is performing a necessary political\r\ntask and because he is genuinely representative of the needs of his\r\nfollowers. Organizations such as Tammany in New York City are founded on\r\na deeply rooted political tradition, a group of popular ideas,\r\nprejudices, and interests, and a species of genuine democratic\r\nassociation which are a guarantee of a long and tenacious life. They\r\nwill survive much of the reforming machinery which is being created for\r\ntheir extirpation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE LABOR UNION AND THE DEMOCRATIC TRADITION\r\n\r\nOne other decisive instance of this specialized organization of American\r\nactivity remains to be considered--that of the labor unions. The power\r\nwhich the unions have obtained in certain industrial centers and the\r\ntightness of their organization would have seemed anomalous to the good\r\nJacksonian Democrat. From his point of view the whole American democracy\r\nwas a kind of labor union whose political constitution provided for a\r\nsubstantially equal division of the products of labor; and if the United\r\nStates had remained as much of an agricultural community as it was in\r\n1830, the Jacksonian system would have preserved a much higher degree of\r\nserviceability.\r\n\r\nExcept in the case of certain local Granger and Populist movements, the\r\nAmerican farmers have never felt the necessity of organization to\r\nadvance either their economic or their political interests. But when the\r\nmechanic or the day-laborer gathered into the cities, he soon discovered\r\nthat life in a democratic state by no means deprived him of special\r\nclass interests. No doubt he was at worst paid better than his European\r\nanalogues, because the demand for labor in a new country was continually\r\noutrunning the supply; but on occasions he was, like his employer,\r\nthreatened with merciless competition. The large and continuous stream\r\nof foreign immigrants, whose standards of living were in the beginning\r\nlower than those which prevailed in this country, were, particularly in\r\nhard times, a constant menace not merely to his advancement, but to the\r\nstability of his economic situation; and he began to organize partly for\r\nthe purpose of protecting himself against such competition. During the\r\npast thirty years the work of organization has made enormous strides;\r\nand it has been much accelerated by the increasing industrial power of\r\nhuge corporations. The mechanic and the laborer have come to believe\r\nthat they must meet organization with organization, and discipline with\r\ndiscipline. Their object in forming trade associations has been\r\nmilitant. Their purpose has been to conquer a larger share of the\r\neconomic product by aggressive associated action.\r\n\r\nThey have been very successful in accomplishing their object. In spite\r\nof the flood of alien immigration the American laborer has been able to\r\nearn an almost constantly increasing wage, and he devoutly thinks that\r\nhis unions have been the chief agency of his stronger economic position.\r\nHe believes in unionism, consequently, as he believes in nothing else.\r\nHe is, indeed, far more aggressively preoccupied with his class, as\r\ncontrasted with his individual interests, than are his employers. He has\r\nno respect for the traditional American individualism as applied to his\r\nown social and economic standing. Whenever he has had the power, he has\r\nsuppressed competition as ruthlessly as have his employers. Every kind\r\nof contumelious reproach is heaped on the heads of the working men who\r\ndare to replace him when he strikes; and he does not scruple to use\r\nunder such conditions weapons more convincing than the most opprobrious\r\nepithets. His own personality is merged in that of the union. No\r\nindividual has any rights as opposed to the interests of the union. He\r\nfully believes, of course, in competition among employers, just as the\r\nemployers are extremely enthusiastic over the individual liberty of the\r\nworking man. But in his own trade he has no use for individuality of any\r\nkind. The union is to be composed of so many equal units who will work\r\nthe same number of hours for the some wages, and no one of whom is to\r\nreceive more pay even for more work. The unionist, that is, has come to\r\ndepend upon his union for that material prosperity and advancement\r\nwhich, according to the American tradition, was to be the inevitable\r\nresult of American political ideas and institutions. His attachment to\r\nhis union has come to be the most important attachment of his life--more\r\nimportant in most cases than his attachment to the American ideal and to\r\nthe national interest.\r\n\r\nSome of the labor unions, like some of the corporations, have taken\r\nadvantage of the infirmities of local and state governments to become\r\narrogant and lawless. On the occasion of a great strike the strikers are\r\noften just as disorderly as they are permitted to be by the local\r\npolice. When the police prevent them from resisting the employment of\r\nstrike-breakers by force, they apparently believe that the political\r\nsystem of the country has been pressed into the service of their\r\nenemies; and they begin to wonder whether it will not be necessary for\r\nthem to control such an inimical political organization. The average\r\nunion laborer, even though he might hesitate himself to assault a\r\n\"scab,\" warmly sympathizes with such assaults, and believes that in the\r\nexisting state of industrial warfare they are morally justifiable. In\r\nthese and in other respects he places his allegiance to his union and to\r\nhis class above his allegiance to his state and to his country. He\r\nbecomes in the interests of his organization a bad citizen, and at times\r\nan inhuman animal, who is ready to maim or even to kill another man and\r\nfor the supposed benefit of himself and his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe most serious danger to the American democratic future which may\r\nissue from aggressive and unscrupulous unionism consists in the state of\r\nmind of which mob-violence is only one expression. The militant\r\nunionists are beginning to talk and believe as if they were at war with\r\nthe existing social and political order--as if the American political\r\nsystem was as inimical to their interests as would be that of any\r\nEuropean monarchy or aristocracy. The idea is being systematically\r\npropagated that the American government is one which favors the\r\nmillionaire rather than the wage-earner; and the facts which either\r\nsuperficially or really support this view are sufficiently numerous to\r\nwin for it an apparently increasing number of adherents. The union\r\nlaborer is tending to become suspicious, not merely of his employer, but\r\nof the constitution of American society. His morals are becoming those\r\nof men engaged in a struggle for life. The manifestations of this state\r\nof mind in notion are not very numerous, although on many occasions they\r\nhave worn a sufficiently sinister aspect. But they are numerous enough\r\nto demand serious attention, for the literature popular among the\r\nunionists is a literature, not merely of discontent, but sometimes of\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\nWhether this aggressive unionism will ever become popular enough to\r\nendanger the foundations of the American political and social order, I\r\nshall not pretend to predict. The practical dangers resulting from it at\r\nany one time are largely neutralized by the mere size of the country and\r\nits extremely complicated social and industrial economy. The menace it\r\ncontains to the nation as a whole can hardly become very critical as\r\nlong as so large a proportion of the American voters are land-owning\r\nfarmers. But while the general national well-being seems sufficiently\r\nprotected for the present against the aggressive assertion of the class\r\ninterests of the unionists, the legal public interest of particular\r\nstates and cities cannot be considered as anywhere near so secure; and\r\nin any event the existence of aggressive discontent on that part of the\r\nunionists must constitute a serious problem for the American legislator\r\nand statesman. Is there any ground for such aggressive discontent? How\r\nhas it come to pass that the American political system, which was\r\ndesigned to guarantee the welfare and prosperity of the people, is the\r\nsubject of such violent popular suspicion? Can these suspicions be\r\nallayed merely by curbing the somewhat excessive opportunities of the\r\nrich man and by the diminution of his influence upon the government? Or\r\ndoes the discontent indicate the existence of more radical economic\r\nevils or the necessity of more radical economic reforms?\r\n\r\nHowever the foregoing questions ought to be answered, there can be no\r\ndoubt as to the nature of the answers, proposed by the unionists\r\nthemselves. The unionist leaders frequently offer verbal homage to the\r\ngreat American principle of equal rights, but what they really demand is\r\nthe abandonment of that principle. What they want is an economic and\r\npolitical order which will discriminate in favor of union labor and\r\nagainst non-union labor; and they want it on the ground that the unions\r\nhave proved to be the most effective agency on behalf of economic and\r\nsocial amelioration of the wage-earner. The unions, that is, are helping\r\nmost effectively to accomplish the task, traditionally attributed to the\r\nAmerican democratic political system--the task of raising the general\r\nstandard of living; and the unionists claim that they deserve on this\r\nground recognition by the state and active encouragement. Obviously,\r\nhowever, such encouragement could not go very far without violating both\r\nthe Federal and many state constitutions--the result being that there is\r\na profound antagonism between our existing political system and what the\r\nunionists consider to be a perfectly fair demand. Like all good\r\nAmericans, while verbally asking for nothing but equal rights, they\r\ninterpret the phrase so that equal rights become equivalent to special\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nOf all the hard blows which the course of American political and\r\neconomic development has dealt the traditional system of political ideas\r\nand institutions, perhaps the hardest is this demand for discrimination\r\non behalf of union labor. It means that the more intelligent and\r\nprogressive American workingmen are coming to believe that the American\r\npolitical and economic organization does not sufficiently secure the\r\nmaterial improvement of the wage-earner. This conviction may be to a\r\nlarge extent erroneous. Certain it is that the wages of unorganized farm\r\nlaborers have been increasing as rapidly during the past thirty years as\r\nhave the wages of the organized mechanics. But whether erroneous or not,\r\nit is widespread and deep-rooted; and whatever danger it possesses is\r\nderived from the fact that it affords to a substantially revolutionary\r\npurpose a large and increasing popular following. The other instances of\r\norganization for special purposes which have been remarked, have\r\nsuperficially, at least, been making for conservatism. The millionaire\r\nand the professional politician want above all things to be let alone,\r\nand to be allowed to enjoy the benefit of their conquests. But the labor\r\norganizations cannot exercise the power necessary in their opinion to\r\ntheir interests without certain radical changes in the political and\r\neconomic order; and inasmuch as their power is likely to increase rather\r\nthan diminish, the American people are confronted with the prospect of\r\npersistent, unscrupulous, and increasing agitation on behalf of an\r\neconomic and political reorganization in favor of one class of citizens.\r\n\r\nThe large corporations and the unions occupy in certain respects a\r\nsimilar relation to the American political system. Their advocates both\r\nbelieve in associated action for themselves and in competition for their\r\nadversaries. They both demand governmental protection and recognition,\r\nbut resent the notion of efficient governmental regulation. They have\r\nboth reached their existing power, partly because of the weakness of the\r\nstate governments, to which they are legally subject, and they both are\r\nopposed to any interference by the Federal government--except\r\nexclusively on their own behalf. Yet they both have become so very\r\npowerful that they are frequently too strong for the state governments,\r\nand in different ways they both traffic for their own benefit with the\r\npoliticians, who so often control those governments. Here, of course,\r\nthe parallelism ends and the divergence begins. The corporations have\r\napparently the best of the situation because existing institutions are\r\nmore favorable to the interests of the corporations than to the\r\ninterests of the unionists; but on the other hand, the unions have the\r\nimmense advantage of a great and increasing numerical strength. They are\r\nbeginning to use the suffrage to promote a class interest, though how\r\nfar they will travel on this perilous path remains doubtful. In any\r\nevent, it is obvious that the development in this country of two such\r\npowerful and unscrupulous and well-organized special interests has\r\ncreated a condition which the founders of the Republic never\r\nanticipated, and which demands as a counterpoise a more effective body\r\nof national opinion, and a more powerful organization of the national\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT BY LAWYERS\r\n\r\nThe corporation, the politician, and the union laborer are all\r\nillustrations of the organization of men representing fundamental\r\ninterests for special purposes. The specialization of American society\r\nhas not, however, stopped with its specialized organization. A similar\r\nprocess has been taking place in the different professions, arts, and\r\ntrades; and of these much the most important is the gradual\r\ntransformation of the function of the lawyer in the American political\r\nsystem. He no longer either performs the same office or occupies the\r\nsame place in the public mind as he did before the Civil War; and the\r\nnature and meaning of this change cannot be understood without some\r\npreliminary consideration of the important part which American lawyers\r\nhave played in American political history.\r\n\r\nThe importance of that part is both considerable and peculiar--as is the\r\ndebt of gratitude which the American people owe to American lawyers.\r\nThey founded the Republic, and they have always governed it. Some few\r\ngenerals, and even one colonel, have been elected to the Presidency of\r\nthe United States; and occasionally business men of one kind or another\r\nhave prevailed in local politics; but really important political action\r\nin our country has almost always been taken under the influence of\r\nlawyers. On the whole, American laws have been made by lawyers; they\r\nhave been executed by lawyers; and, of course, they have been expounded\r\nby lawyers. Their predominance has been practically complete; and so far\r\nas I know, it has been unprecedented. No other great people, either in\r\nclassic, mediæval, or modern times, has ever allowed such a professional\r\nmonopoly of governmental functions. Certain religious bodies have\r\nsubmitted for a while to the dominion of ecclesiastical lawyers; but the\r\nlawyer has rarely been allowed to interfere either in the executive or\r\nthe legislative branches of the government. The lawyer phrased the laws\r\nand he expounded them for the benefit of litigants. The construction\r\nwhich he has placed upon bodies of customary law, particularly in\r\nEngland, has sometimes been equivalent to the most permanent and\r\nfruitful legislation. But the people responsible for the government of\r\nEuropean countries have rarely been trained lawyers, whereas American\r\nstatesmen, untrained in the law, are palpable exceptions. This dominion\r\nof lawyers is so defiant of precedent that it must be due to certain\r\nnovel and peremptory American conditions.\r\n\r\nThe American would claim, of course, that the unprecedented prominence\r\nof the lawyer in American politics is to be explained on the ground that\r\nthe American government is a government by law. The lawyer is\r\nnecessarily of subordinate importance in any political system tending\r\ntowards absolutism. He is even of subordinate importance in a liberal\r\nsystem such as that of Great Britain, where Crown and Parliament, acting\r\ntogether, have the power to enact any desired legislation. The Federal\r\nConstitution, on the other hand, by establishing the Supreme Court as\r\nthe interpreter of the Fundamental Law, and as a separate and\r\nindependent department of the government, really made the American\r\nlawyer responsible for the future of the country. In so far as the\r\nConstitution continues to prevail, the Supreme Court becomes the final\r\narbiter of the destinies of the United States. Whenever its action can\r\nbe legally invoked, it can, if necessary, declare the will of either or\r\nboth the President and Congress of no effect; and inasmuch as almost\r\nevery important question of public policy raises corresponding questions\r\nof Constitutional interpretation, its possible or actual influence\r\ndominates American political discussion. Thus the lawyer, when\r\nconsecrated as Justice of the Supreme Court, has become the High Priest\r\nof our political faith. He sits in the sanctuary and guards the sacred\r\nrights which have been enshrined in the ark of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe importance of lawyers as legislators and executives in the actual\r\nwork of American government has been an indirect consequence of the\r\npeculiar function of the Supreme Court in the American political system.\r\nThe state constitutions confer a corresponding function on the highest\r\nstate courts, although they make no similar provision for the\r\nindependence of the state judiciary. The whole business of American\r\ngovernment is so entangled in a network of legal conditions that a\r\ntraining in the law is the beet education which an American public man\r\ncan receive. The first question asked of any important legislative\r\nproject, whether state or Federal, concerns its constitutionality; and\r\nthe question of its wisdom is necessarily subordinate to these\r\nfundamental legal considerations. The statesman, who is not a lawyer,\r\nsuffers under many disadvantages--not the least of which is the\r\nsuspicion wherewith he is regarded by his legal fellow-statesmen. When\r\nthey talk about a government by law, they really mean a government by\r\nlawyers; and they are by way of believing that government by anybody but\r\nlawyers is really unsafe.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution bestowed upon the American lawyer a constructive\r\npolitical function; and this function has been confirmed and even\r\nenlarged by American political custom and practice. The work of finally\r\ninterpreting the Federal Constitution has rarely been either conceived\r\nor executed in a merely negative spirit. The construction, which\r\nsuccessive generations of Supreme Court Justices have placed upon the\r\ninstrument, has tended to enlarge its scope, and make it a legal\r\ngarment, which was being better cut to fit the American political and\r\neconomic organism. In its original form, and to a certain extent in its\r\npresent form, the Constitution was in many respects an ambiguous\r\ndocument which might have been interpreted along several different\r\nlines; and the Supreme Court in its official expositions has been\r\ninfluenced by other than strictly legal and verbal reasons--by\r\nconsiderations of public welfare or by general political ideas. But such\r\nconstructive interpretations have been most cautiously and discreetly\r\nadmitted. In proclaiming them, the Supreme Court has usually represented\r\na substantial consensus of the better legal opinion of the time; and\r\nconstructions of this kind are accepted and confirmed only when any\r\nparticular decision is the expression of some permanent advance or\r\nachievement in political thinking by the American lawyer. It becomes\r\nconsequently of the utmost importance that American lawyers should\r\nreally represent the current of national political opinion. The Supreme\r\nCourt has been, on the whole, one of the great successes of the American\r\npolitical system, because the lawyers, whom it represented, were\r\nthemselves representative of the ideas and interests of the bulk of\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen; and if for any reason they become less\r\nrepresentative, a dangerous division would be created between the body\r\nof American public opinion and its official and final legal expositors.\r\nIf the lawyers have any reason to misinterpret a serious political\r\nproblem, the difficulty of dealing therewith is much increased, because\r\nin addition to the ordinary risks of political therapeutics there will\r\nbe added that of a false diagnosis by the family doctor. The adequacy of\r\nthe lawyers' training, the disinterestedness of their political motives,\r\nthe fairness of their mental outlook, and the closeness of their contact\r\nwith the national public opinion--all become matters of grave public\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nIt can be fairly asserted that the qualifications of the American lawyer\r\nfor his traditional task as the official interpreter and guide of\r\nAmerican constitutional democracy have been considerably impaired.\r\nWhatever his qualifications have been for the task (and they have,\r\nperhaps, been over-estimated) they are no longer as substantial as they\r\nwere. Not only has the average lawyer become a less representative\r\ncitizen, but a strictly legal training has become a less desirable\r\npreparation for the candid consideration of contemporary political\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nSince 1870 the lawyer has been traveling in the same path as the\r\nbusiness man and the politician. He has tended to become a professional\r\nspecialist, and to give all his time to his specialty. The greatest and\r\nmost successful American lawyers no longer become legislators and\r\nstatesmen as they did in the time of Daniel Webster. They no longer\r\nobtain the experience of men and affairs which an active political life\r\nbrings with it. Their professional practice, whenever they are\r\nsuccessful, is so remunerative and so exacting that they cannot afford\r\neither the time or the money which a political career demands. The most\r\neminent American lawyers usually remain lawyers all their lives; and if\r\nthey abandon private practice at all, it is generally for the purpose of\r\ntaking a seat on the Bench. Like nearly all other Americans they have\r\nfound rigid specialization a condition of success.\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of our legislators and executives continue to\r\nbe lawyers, but the difference is that now they are more likely to be\r\nless successful lawyers. Knowledge of the law and a legal habit of mind\r\nstill have a great practical value in political work; and the\r\nprofessional politicians, who are themselves rarely men of legal\r\ntraining, need the services of lawyers whose legal methods are not\r\nattenuated by scruples. Lawyers of this class occupy the same relation\r\nto the local political \"Bosses\" as the European lawyer used to occupy in\r\nthe court of the absolute monarch. He phrases the legislation which the\r\nruler decides to be of private or public benefit; and he acts frequently\r\nas his employer's official mouthpiece and special pleader.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many excellent and even eminent lawyers continue to play an\r\nimportant and an honorable part in American politics. Mr. Elihu Root is\r\na conspicuous example of a lawyer, who has sacrificed a most lucrative\r\nprivate practice for the purpose of giving his country the benefit of\r\nhis great abilities. Mr. Taft was, of course, a lawyer before he was an\r\nadministrator, though he had made no professional success corresponding\r\nto that of Mr. Root. Mr. Hughes, also, was a successful lawyer. The\r\nreform movement has brought into prominence many public-spirited\r\nlawyers, who, either as attorney-generals or as district attorneys, have\r\nsought vigorously to enforce the law and punish its violators. The\r\nlawyers, like every class of business and professional men, have felt\r\nthe influence of the reforming ideas, which have become so conspicuous\r\nin American practical politics, and they have performed admirable and\r\nessential work on behalf of reform.\r\n\r\nBut it is equally true that the most prominent and thorough-going\r\nreformers, such as Roosevelt, Bryan, and Hearst, are not lawyers by\r\nprofession, and that the majority of prominent American lawyers are not\r\nreformers. The tendency of the legally trained mind is inevitably and\r\nextremely conservative. So far as reform consists in the enforcement of\r\nthe law, it is, of course, supported by the majority of successful\r\nlawyers; but so far as reform has come to mean a tendency to political\r\nor economic reorganization, it has to face the opposition of the bulk of\r\nAmerican legal opinion. The existing political order has been created by\r\nlawyers; and they naturally believe somewhat obsequiously in a system\r\nfor which they are responsible, and from which they benefit. This\r\ngovernment by law, of which they boast, is not only a government by\r\nlawyers, but is a government in the interest of litigation. It makes\r\nlegal advice more constantly essential to the corporation and the\r\nindividual than any European political system. The lawyer, just as much\r\nas the millionaire and the politician, has reaped a bountiful harvest\r\nfrom the inefficiency and irresponsibility of American state\r\ngovernments, and from the worship of individual rights.\r\n\r\nThey have corporations in Europe, but they have nothing corresponding to\r\nthe American corporation lawyer. The ablest American lawyers have been\r\nretained by the special interests. In some cases they have been retained\r\nto perform tasks which must have been repugnant to honest men; but that\r\nis not the most serious aspect of the situation. The retainer which the\r\nAmerican legal profession has accepted from the corporations inevitably\r\nincreases its natural tendency to a blind conservatism; and its\r\ninfluence has been used not for the purpose of extricating the large\r\ncorporations from their dubious and dangerous legal situation, but for\r\nthe purpose of keeping them entangled in its meshes. At a time when the\r\npublic interest needs a candid reconsideration of the basis and the\r\npurpose of the American legal system, they have either opposed or\r\ncontributed little to the essential work, and in adopting this course\r\nthey have betrayed the interests of their more profitable clients--the\r\nlarge corporations themselves--whose one chance of perpetuation depends\r\nupon political and legal reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe conservative believer in the existing American political system\r\nwill doubtless reply that the lawyer, in so far as he opposes radical\r\nreform or reorganization, is merely remaining true to his function as\r\nthe High Priest of American constitutional democracy. And no doubt it is\r\nbegging the question at the present stage of this discussion, to assert\r\nthat American lawyers as such are not so well qualified as they were to\r\nguide American political thought and action. But it can at least be\r\nmaintained that, assuming some radical reorganization to be necessary,\r\nthe existing prejudices, interests, and mental outlook of the American\r\nlawyer disqualify him for the task. The legal profession is risking its\r\ntraditional position as the mouthpiece of the American political creed\r\nand faith upon the adequacy of the existing political system. If there\r\nis any thorough-going reorganization needed, it will be brought about in\r\nspite of the opposition of the legal profession. They occupy in relation\r\nto the modern economic and political problem a position similar to that\r\nof the Constitutional Unionists previous to the Civil War. Those\r\nestimable gentlemen believed devoutly that the Constitution, which\r\ncreated the problem of slavery and provoked the anti-slavery agitation,\r\nwas adequate to its solution. In the same spirit learned lawyers now\r\naffirm that the existing problems can easily be solved, if only American\r\npublic opinion remain faithful to the Constitution. But it may be that\r\nthe Constitution, as well as the system of local political government\r\nbuilt up around the Federal Constitution, is itself partly responsible\r\nfor some of the existing abuses, evils, and problems; and if so, the\r\nAmerican lawyer may be useful, as he was before the Civil War, in\r\nevading our difficulties; but he will not be very useful in settling\r\nthem. He may try to settle them by decisions of the Supreme Court; but\r\nsuch decisions,--assuming, of course, that the problem is as inexorable\r\nas was that of the legal existence of slavery in a democratic\r\nnation,--such decisions would have precisely the same effect on public\r\nopinion as did the Dred Scott decision. They would merely excite a\r\ncrisis, which they were intended to allay, and strengthen the hands of\r\nthe more radical critics of the existing political system.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND THE SOCIAL PROBLEM\r\n\r\nThe changes which have been taking place in industrial and political and\r\nsocial conditions have all tended to impair the consistency of feeling\r\ncharacteristic of the first phase of American national democracy.\r\nAmericans are divided from one another much more than they were during\r\nthe Middle Period by differences of interest, of intellectual outlook,\r\nof moral and technical standards, and of manner of life. Grave\r\ninequalities of power and deep-lying differences of purpose have\r\ndeveloped in relation of the several primary American activities. The\r\nmillionaire, the \"Boss,\" the union laborer, and the lawyer, have all\r\ntaken advantage of the loose American political organization to promote\r\nsomewhat unscrupulously their own interests, and to obtain special\r\nsources of power and profit at the expense of a wholesome national\r\nbalance. But the foregoing examples of specialized organization and\r\npurposes do not stand alone. They are the most conspicuous and the most\r\ntroublesome because of the power wielded by those particular classes,\r\nand because they can claim for their purposes the support of certain\r\naspects of the American national tradition. Yet the same process has\r\nbeen taking place in all the other departments of American social and\r\nintellectual life. Technical experts of all kinds--engineers, men of\r\nletters, and artists--have all of them been asserting much more\r\nvigorously their own special interests and purposes. In so asserting\r\nthemselves they cannot claim the support of the American national\r\ndemocratic convention. On the contrary, the proclamation of high\r\ntechnical standards and of insistent individual purposes is equivalent\r\nto a revolt from the traditions of the Middle Period, which were all in\r\nfavor of cheap work and the average worker. But different as is the\r\nsituation of these technical experts, the fundamental meaning of their\r\nself-assertion is analogous to that of the millionaire and the \"Boss.\"\r\nThe vast incoherent mass of the American people is falling into definite\r\nsocial groups, which restrict and define the mental outlook and social\r\nexperience of their members. The all-round man of the innocent Middle\r\nPeriod has become the exception. The earlier homogeneity of American\r\nsociety has been impaired, and no authoritative and edifying, but\r\nconscious, social ideal has as yet taken its place.\r\n\r\nThe specialized organization of American industry, politics, and labor,\r\nand the increasingly severe special discipline imposed upon the\r\nindividual, are not to be considered as evils. On the contrary, they are\r\nindications of greater practical efficiency, and they contain a promise\r\nof individual moral and intellectual emancipation. But they have their\r\nserious and perilous aspects, because no sufficient provision has been\r\nmade for them in the national democratic tradition. What it means is\r\nthat the American nation is being confronted by a problem which the\r\nearlier national democracy expected to avoid--the social problem. By the\r\nsocial problem is usually meant the problem of poverty; but grave\r\ninequalities of wealth are merely the most dangerous and distressing\r\nexpression of fundamental differences among the members of a society of\r\ninterest and of intellectual and moral standards. In its deepest aspect,\r\nconsequently, the social problem is the problem of preventing such\r\ndivisions from dissolving the society into which they enter--of keeping\r\nsuch a highly differentiated society fundamentally sound and whole.\r\n\r\nIn this country the solution of the social problem demands the\r\nsubstitution of a conscious social ideal for the earlier instinctive\r\nhomogeneity of the American nation. That homogeneity has disappeared\r\nnever to return. We should not want it to return, because it was\r\ndependent upon too many sacrifices of individual purpose and\r\nachievement. But a democracy cannot dispense with the solidarity which\r\nit imparted to American life, and in one way or another such solidarity\r\nmust be restored. There is only one way in which it can be restored, and\r\nthat is by means of a democratic social ideal, which shall give\r\nconsistency to American social life, without entailing any essential\r\nsacrifice of desirable individual and class distinctions. I have used\r\nthe word \"restoration\" to describe this binding and healing process; but\r\nthe consistency which would result from the loyal realization of a\r\ncomprehensive coherent democratic social ideal would differ radically\r\nfrom the earlier American homogeneity of feeling. The solidarity which\r\nit would impart to American society would have its basis in feeling and\r\nits results in good fellowship; but it must always remain a promise and\r\nconstructive ideal rather than a finished performance. The social\r\nproblem must, as long as societies continue to endure, be solved afresh\r\nby almost every generation; and the one chance of progress depends both\r\nupon an invincible loyalty to a constructive social ideal and upon a\r\ncurrent understanding by the new generation of the actual experience of\r\nits predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nREFORM AND THE REFORMERS\r\n\r\nSensible and patriotic Americans have not, of course, tamely and ignobly\r\nsubmitted to the obvious evils of their political and economic\r\ncondition. There was, indeed, a season when the average good American\r\nrefused to take these evils seriously. He was possessed by the idea that\r\nAmerican life was a stream, which purified itself in the running, and\r\nthat reformers and critics were merely men who prevented the stream from\r\nrunning free. He looked upon the first spasmodic and ineffective\r\nprotests with something like contempt. Reformers he appraised as\r\nbusybodies, who were protesting against the conditions of success in\r\nbusiness and politics. He nicknamed them \"mugwumps\" and continued to\r\nvote the regular tickets of his party. There succeeded to this phase of\r\ncontemptuous dislike a few years, in which he was somewhat bewildered by\r\nthe increasing evidences of corruption in American politics and\r\nlawlessness in American business methods, and during which he\r\noccasionally supported some favorite among the several reforming\r\nmovements. Then a habit of criticism and reform increased with the sense\r\nthat the evils were both more flagrant and more stubborn than he\r\nimagined, until at the present time average well-intentioned Americans\r\nare likely to be reformers of one kind or another, while the more\r\nintelligent and disinterested of them are pretty sure to vote a \"reform\"\r\nticket. To stand for a programme of reform has become one of the\r\nrecognized roads to popularity. The political leaders with the largest\r\npersonal followings are some kind of reformers. They sit in presidential\r\nchairs; they occupy executive mansions; they extort legislation from\r\nunwilling politicians; they regulate and abuse the erring corporations;\r\nthey are coming to control the press; and they are the most aggressive\r\nforce in American public opinion. The supporters and beneficiaries of\r\nexisting abuses still control much of the official and practically all\r\nthe unofficial political and business machinery; but they are less\r\ndomineering and self-confident than they were. The reformers have both\r\nscared and bewildered them. They begin to realize that reform has come\r\nto stay, and perhaps even to conquer, while reform itself is beginning\r\nto pay the penalty of success by being threatened with deterioration. It\r\nhas had not only its hero in Theodore Roosevelt, but its specter in\r\nWilliam R. Hearst.\r\n\r\nIn studying the course of the reforming movement during the last\r\ntwenty-five years, it appears that, while reform has had a history, this\r\nhistory is only beginning. Since 1880, or even 1895 or 1900, it has been\r\ntransformed in many significant ways. In the beginning it was spasmodic\r\nin its outbursts, innocent in its purposes, and narrow in its outlook.\r\nIt sprang up almost spontaneously in a number of different places and in\r\na number of different detached movements; and its adherents did not look\r\nmuch beyond a victory at a particular election, or the passage of a few\r\nremedial laws. Gradually, however, it increased in definiteness,\r\npersistence, and comprehensiveness of purpose. The reformers found the\r\nneed of permanent organization, of constant work, and even within\r\nlimits, of a positive programme. Their success and their influence upon\r\npublic opinion increased just in proportion as they began to take their\r\njob seriously. Indeed, they have become extremely self-conscious in\r\nrelation to their present standing and their future responsibilities.\r\nThey are beginning to predict the most abundant results from the\r\n\"uplift\" movement, of which they are the leaders. They confidently\r\nanticipate that they are destined to make a much more salient and\r\nsignificant contribution to the history of their country than has been\r\nmade by any group of political leaders since the Civil War.\r\n\r\nIt is in a sense a misnomer to write of \"Reform\" as a single thing.\r\nReform is, as a matter of fact, all sorts of things. The name has been\r\napplied to a number of separate political agitations, which have been\r\nstarted by different people at different times in different parts of the\r\ncountry, and these separate movements have secured very different kinds\r\nof support, and have run very different courses. Tariff reform, for\r\ninstance, was an early and popular agitation whose peculiarity has\r\nconsisted in securing the support of one of the two national parties,\r\nbut which in spite of that support has so far made little substantial\r\nprogress. Civil service reform, on the other hand, was the first\r\nagitation looking in the direction of political purification. The early\r\nreformers believed that the eradication of the spoils system would deal\r\na deadly blow at political corruption and professional politics. But\r\nalthough they have been fairly successful in establishing the \"merit\"\r\nsystem in the various public offices, the results of the reform have not\r\nequaled the promises of its advocates. While it is still an important\r\npart of the programme of reform from the point of view of many\r\nreformers, it has recently been over-shadowed by other issues. It does\r\nnot provoke either as much interest as it did or as much opposition.\r\nMunicipal reform has, of course, almost as many centers of agitation as\r\nthere are centers of corruption--that is, large municipalities in the\r\nUnited States. It began as a series of local non-partisan movements for\r\nthe enforcement of the laws, the dispossession of the \"rascals,\" and the\r\nbusinesslike, efficient administration of municipal affairs; but the\r\nreformers discovered in many cases that municipal corruption could not\r\nbe eradicated without the reform of state politics, and without some\r\ndrastic purging of the local public service corporations. They have\r\nconsequently in many cases enlarged the area of their agitation; but in\r\nso doing they have become divided among themselves, and their agitation\r\nhas usually lost its non-partisan character. Finally the agitation\r\nagainst the trusts has developed a confused hodge-podge of harmless and\r\ndeadly, overlapping and mutually exclusive, remedies, which are the\r\ncause of endless disagreements. Of course they are all for the People\r\nand against the Octopus, but beyond this precise and comprehensive\r\nstatement of the issue, the reformers have endlessly different views\r\nabout the nature of the disease and the severity of the necessary\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nIf reform is an ambiguous and many-headed thing, the leading reformers\r\nare as far as possible from being a body of men capable of mutual\r\ncoöperation. They differ almost as widely among themselves as they do\r\nfrom the beneficiaries or supporters of the existing abuses. William R.\r\nHearst, William Travers Jerome, Seth Low, and George B. McClellan are\r\nall in their different ways reformers; but they would not constitute\r\nprecisely a happy family. Indeed, Mr. Hearst, who in his own opinion is\r\nthe only immaculate reformer, is, in the eyes of his fellow-reformers,\r\nas dangerous a public enemy as the most corrupt politician or the most\r\nunscrupulous millionaire. Any reformer who, like Mr. William Jennings\r\nBryan, proclaims views which are in some respects more than usually\r\nradical, comes in for heartier denunciation from his brothers in reform\r\nthan he does from the conservatives. Each of our leading reformers is\r\nmore or less a man on horseback, who is seeking to popularize a\r\nparticular brand of reform, and who is inclined to doubt whether the\r\nother brands are available for public consumption without rigid\r\ninspection. Consequently, the party of reform is broken up into a number\r\nof insurgent personalities. \"The typical reformer,\" says the late Alfred\r\nHodder in a book written in praise of Mr. William Travers Jerome, \"The\r\ntypical reformer is a 'star,' and a typical reform administration is\r\nusually a company of stars,\" and a most amusing piece of special\r\npleading is the reasoning whereby the same author seeks to prove that\r\nMr. Jerome himself is or was not a \"star\" performer. The preference\r\nwhich individual performers have shown for leading parts is in itself\r\nfar from being a bad thing, but the lack of \"team play\" has none the\r\nless diminished the efficiency of reform as a practical and prosperous\r\npolitical agitation.\r\n\r\nThese disagreements are the more significant, because the different\r\n\"star\" reformers are sufficiently united upon their statement of\r\nfundamental principles. They all of them agree to conceive of reform as\r\nat bottom a moral protest and awakening, which seeks to enforce the\r\nviolated laws and to restore the American political and economic system\r\nto its pristine purity and vigor. From their point of view certain\r\nabuses have become unwholesomely conspicuous, because the average\r\nAmerican citizen has been a little lethargic, and allowed a few of his\r\nmore energetic and unscrupulous fellow-citizens to exploit for selfish\r\npurposes the opportunities of American business and politics. The\r\nfunction of reform, consequently, is to deprive these parasites of their\r\npeculiar opportunities. Few reformers anticipate now that this task will\r\nbe easily or quickly accomplished. They are coming to realize that the\r\nabuses are firmly intrenched, and a prolonged siege as well as constant\r\nassaults are necessary for final success. Some reformers are even\r\ntending to the opinion that a tradition of reform and succession of\r\nreformers will be demanded for the vigilant protection of the American\r\npolitical and economic system against abuse. But the point is the\r\nagreement among practical reformers that reform means at bottom no more\r\nthan moral and political purification. It may, indeed, bring with it the\r\nnecessity of a certain amount of reorganization; but such reorganization\r\nwill aim merely at the improvement of the existing political and\r\neconomic machinery. Present and future reformers must cleanse, oil, and\r\npatch a piece of economic and political machinery, which in all\r\nessentials is adequate to its purpose. The millionaire and the trust\r\nhave appropriated too many of the economic opportunities formerly\r\nenjoyed by the people. The corrupt politician has usurped too much of\r\nthe power which should be exercised by the people. Reform must restore\r\nto the people the opportunities and power of which they have been\r\ndeprived.\r\n\r\nAn agitation of this kind, deriving as it does its principles and\r\npurposes from the very source of American democracy, would seem to\r\ndeserve the support of all good Americans: and such support was in the\r\nbeginning expected. Reformers have always tended to believe that their\r\nagitation ought to be and essentially was non-partisan. They considered\r\nit inconceivable either that patriotic American citizens should hesitate\r\nabout restoring the purity and vigor of American institutions, or such\r\nan object should not appeal to every disinterested man, irrespective of\r\nparty. It was a fight between the law and its violators, between the\r\nFaithful and the Heretic, between the Good and the Wicked. In such a\r\nfight there was, of course, only one aide to take. It was not to be\r\ndoubted that the honest men, who constitute, of course, an enormous\r\nmajority of the \"plain people,\" would rally to the banners of reform.\r\nThe rascals would be turned out; the people would regain their economic\r\nopportunities and political rights; and the American democracy would\r\npursue undefiled its triumphant career of legalized prosperity.\r\n\r\nThese hopes have never been realized. Reform has rarely been\r\nnon-partisan--except in the minds of its more innocent advocates. Now\r\nand then an agitation for municipal reform in a particular city will\r\nsuffer a spasm of non-partisanship; but the reformers soon develop such\r\nlively differences among themselves, that they separate into special\r\ngroups or else resume their regular party ties. Their common conception\r\nof reform as fundamentally a moral awakening, which seeks to restore the\r\nAmerican, political and economic system to its early purity and vigor,\r\ndoes not help them to unity of action or to unity in the framing of a\r\nremedial policy. Different reformers really mean something very\r\ndifferent by the traditional system, from which American practice has\r\ndeparted and which they propose to restore. Some of them mean thereby a\r\ncondition of spiritual excellence, which will be restored by a sort of\r\npolitico-moral revivalism and which will somehow make the results of\r\ndivine and popular election coincide. Others mean nothing more than the\r\nrigid enforcement of existing laws. Still others mean a new legal\r\nexpression of the traditional democratic principle, framed to meet the\r\nnew political and social conditions; but the reformers who agree upon\r\nthis last conception of reform disagree radically as to what the new\r\nlegal expression should be. The traditional system, which they seek to\r\nrestore, assumes almost as many shapes as there are leading reformers;\r\nand as the reforming movement develops, the disagreements among the\r\nreformers become more instead of less definite and acute.\r\n\r\nThe inability of the reformers to coöperate in action or to agree as to\r\nthe application of their principles is in part merely a natural result\r\nof their essential work. Reformers are primarily protestants; and\r\nprotestants are naturally insubordinate. They have been protesting\r\nagainst the established order in American business and politics. Their\r\nprotest implies a certain degree of moral and intellectual independence,\r\nwhich makes them dislike to surrender or subordinate their own personal\r\nopinions and manner of action. Such independence is a new and refreshing\r\nthing, which has suddenly made American politics much more interesting\r\nand significant than it has been at any time since the Civil War. It has\r\na high value wholly apart from its immediate political results. It means\r\nthat the American people are beginning a new phase of their political\r\nexperience,--a phase in which there will be room for a much freer play\r\nof individual ability and character. Inevitably the sudden realization\r\nby certain exceptional politicians that they have a right to be\r\nindividuals, and that they can take a strong line of their own in\r\npolitics without being disqualified for practical political association\r\nwith their fellow-countrymen--such a new light could hardly break\r\nwithout tempting the performers to over-play the part. The fact that\r\nthey have over-played their parts, and have wasted time and energy over\r\nmeaningless and unnecessary disagreements is not in itself a matter of\r\nmuch importance. The great majority of them are disinterested and\r\npatriotic men, who will not allow in the long run either personal\r\nambition or political crotchets to prevent them from coöperating for the\r\ngood of the cause.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, neither public spirit nor patriotism will be\r\nsufficient to bring them effectively together--any more than genuine\r\nexcellence of intention and real public spirit enabled patriotic\r\nAmericans to coöperate upon a remedial policy during the years\r\nimmediately preceding the Civil War. The plain fact is that the\r\ntraditional American political system, which so many good reformers wish\r\nto restore by some sort of reforming revivalism, is just as much\r\nresponsible for the existing political and economic abuses as the\r\nConstitution was responsible for the evil of slavery. As long,\r\nconsequently, as reform is considered to be a species of higher\r\nconservatism, the existing abuses can no more be frankly faced and fully\r\nunderstood than the Whig leaders were able to face and understand the\r\nfull meaning and consequences of any attempt on the part of a democracy\r\nto keep house with slavery. The first condition of a better\r\nunderstanding and a more efficient coöperation among the reforming\r\nleaders is a better understanding of the meaning of reform and the\r\nfunction of reformers. They will never be united on the basis of\r\nallegiance to the traditional American political creed, because that\r\ncreed itself is overflowing with inconsistencies and ambiguities, which\r\nafford a footing for almost every extreme of radicalism and\r\nconservatism; and in case they persist in the attempt to reform\r\npolitical and economic abuses merely by a restoration of earlier\r\nconditions and methods, they will be compromising much that is good in\r\nthe present economic and political organization without recovering that\r\nwhich was good in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE LOGIC OF REFORM\r\n\r\nThe prevailing preconception of the reformers, that the existing evils\r\nand abuses have been due chiefly to the energy and lack of scruple with\r\nwhich business men and politicians have taken advantage of the good but\r\neasy-going American, and that a general increase of moral energy,\r\nassisted by some minor legal changes, will restore the balance,--such a\r\nconception of the situation is less than half true. No doubt, the \"plain\r\npeople\" of the United States have been morally indifferent, and have\r\nallowed unscrupulous special interests to usurp too much power; but that\r\nis far from being the whole story. The unscrupulous energy of the \"Boss\"\r\nor the \"tainted\" millionaire is vitally related to the moral\r\nindifference of the \"plain people.\" Both of them have been encouraged to\r\nbelieve by the nature of our traditional ideas and institutions that a\r\nman could be patriotic without being either public-spirited or\r\ndisinterested. The democratic state has been conceived as a piece of\r\npolitical machinery, which existed for the purpose of securing certain\r\nindividual rights and opportunities--the expectation being that the\r\ngreatest individual happiness would be thereby promoted, and one which\r\nharmonized with the public interest. Consequently when the \"Boss\" and\r\nthe \"tainted\" millionaire took advantage of this situation to secure for\r\nthemselves an unusually large amount of political and economic power,\r\nthey were putting into practice an idea which traditionally had been\r\nentirely respectable, and which during the pioneer period had not worked\r\nbadly. On the other hand, when, the mass of American voters failed to\r\ndetect the danger of such usurpation until it had gone altogether too\r\nfar, they, too, were not without warrant for their lethargy and\r\ncallousness. They, too, in a smaller way had considered the American\r\npolitical and economic system chiefly as a system framed for their\r\nindividual benefit, and it did not seem sportsmanlike to turn and rend\r\ntheir more successful competitors, until they were told that the\r\n\"trusts\" and the \"Bosses\" were violating the sacred principle of equal\r\nrights. Thus the abuses of which we are complaining are not weeds which\r\nhave been allowed to spring up from neglect, and which can be eradicated\r\nby a man with a hoe. They are cultivated plants, which, if not\r\nprecisely specified in the plan of the American political and economic\r\ngarden, have at least been encouraged by traditional methods of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this dangerous usurpation of power has been accomplished\r\npartly by illegal methods has blinded many reformers to two\r\nconsiderations, which have a vital relation to both the theory and the\r\npractice of reform. Violation of the law was itself partly the result of\r\nconflicting and unwise state legislation, and for this reason did not\r\nseem very heinous either to its perpetrators or to public opinion. But\r\neven if the law had not been violated, similar results would have\r\nfollowed. Under the traditional American system, with the freedom\r\npermitted to the individual, with the restriction placed on the central\r\nauthority, and with its assumption of a substantial identity between the\r\nindividual and the public interest--under such a system unusually\r\nenergetic and unscrupulous men were bound to seize a kind and an amount\r\nof political and economic power which was not entirely wholesome. They\r\nhad a license to do so; and if they had failed to take advantage\r\nthereof, their failure would have been an indication, not of\r\ndisinterestedness or moral impeccability, but of sheer weakness and\r\ninefficiency.\r\n\r\nHow utterly confusing it is, consequently, to consider reform as\r\nequivalent merely to the restoration of the American democracy to a\r\nformer condition of purity and excellence! Our earlier political and\r\neconomic condition was not at its best a fit subject for any great\r\namount of complacency. It cannot be restored, even if we would; and the\r\npublic interest has nothing to gain by its restoration. The usurpation\r\nof power by \"trusts\" and \"Bosses\" is more than anything else an\r\nexpression of a desirable individual initiative and organizing\r\nability--which have been allowed to become dangerous and partly corrupt,\r\nbecause of the incoherence and the lack of purpose and responsibility in\r\nthe traditional American political and economic system. A \"purification\"\r\nmight well destroy the good with the evil; and even if it were\r\nsuccessful in eradicating certain abuses, would only prepare the way for\r\nthe outbreak in another form of the tendency towards individual\r\naggrandizement and social classification. No amount of moral energy,\r\ndirected merely towards the enforcement of the laws, can possibly avail\r\nto accomplish any genuine or lasting reform. It is the laws themselves\r\nwhich are partly at fault, and still more at fault is the group of ideas\r\nand traditional practices behind the laws.\r\n\r\nReformers have failed for the most part to reach a correct diagnosis of\r\nexisting political and economic abuses, because they are almost as much\r\nthe victim of perverted, confused, and routine habits of political\r\nthought as is the ordinary politician. They have eschewed the tradition\r\nof partisan conformity in reference to controverted political questions,\r\nbut they have not eschewed a still more insidious tradition of\r\nconformity--the tradition that a patriotic American citizen must not in\r\nhis political thinking go beyond the formulas consecrated in the sacred\r\nAmerican writings. They adhere to the stupefying rule that the good\r\nFathers of the Republic relieved their children from the necessity of\r\nvigorous, independent, or consistent thinking in political\r\nmatters,--that it is the duty of their loyal children to repeat the\r\nsacred words and then await a miraculous consummation of individual and\r\nsocial prosperity. Accordingly, all the leading reformers begin by\r\npiously reiterating certain phrases about equal rights for all and\r\nspecial privileges for none, and of government of the people, by the\r\npeople, and for the people. Having in this way proved their fundamental\r\npolitical orthodoxy, they proceed to interpret the phrases according to\r\ntheir personal, class, local, and partisan preconceptions and interests.\r\nThey have never stopped to inquire whether the principle of equal rights\r\nin its actual embodiment in American institutional and political\r\npractice has not been partly responsible for some of the existing\r\nabuses, whether it is either a safe or sufficient platform for a\r\nreforming movement, and whether its continued proclamation as the\r\nfundamental political principle of a democracy will help or hinder the\r\nhigher democratic consummation. Their unquestioning orthodoxy in this\r\nrespect has made them faithless both to their own personal interest as\r\nreformers and to the cause of reform. Reform exclusively as a moral\r\nprotest and awakening is condemned to sterility. Reformers exclusively\r\nas moral protestants and purifiers are condemned to misdirected effort,\r\nto an illiberal puritanism, and to personal self-stultification. Reform\r\nmust necessarily mean an intellectual as well as a moral challenge; and\r\nits higher purposes will never be accomplished unless it is accompanied\r\nby a masterful and jubilant intellectual awakening.\r\n\r\nAll Americans, whether they are professional politicians or reformer,\r\n\"predatory\" millionaires or common people, political philosophers or\r\nschoolboys, accept the principle of \"equal rights for all and special\r\nprivileges for none\" as the absolutely sufficient rule of an American\r\ndemocratic political system. The platforms of both parties testify on\r\nits behalf. Corporation lawyers and their clients appear frequently to\r\nbelieve in it. Tammany offers tribute to it during every local political\r\ncampaign in New York. A Democratic Senator, in the intervals between his\r\nvotes for increased duties on the products of his state, declares it to\r\nbe the summary of all political wisdom. The fact that Mr. Bryan\r\nincorporates it in most of his speeches does not prevent Mr. Hearst from\r\nkeeping it standing in type for the purpose of showing how very American\r\nthe _American_ can be. The fact that Mr. Hearst has appropriated it with\r\nthe American flag as belonging peculiarly to himself has not prevented\r\nMr. Roosevelt from explaining the whole of his policy of reform as at\r\nthe bottom an attempt to restore a \"Square Deal\"--that is, a condition\r\nof equal rights and non-existing privileges. More radical reformers find\r\nthe same principle equally useful for their own purposes. Mr. Frederic\r\nC. Howe, in his \"Hope of Democracy,\" bases an elaborate scheme of\r\nmunicipal socialism exclusively upon it. Mr. William Smythe, in his\r\n\"Constructive Democracy,\" finds warrant in the same principle for the\r\nimmediate purchase by the central government of the railway and \"trust\"\r\nfranchises. Mr. Henry George, Jr., in his \"Menace of Privilege,\" asserts\r\nthat the plain American citizen can never enjoy equality of rights as\r\nlong as land, mines, railroad rights of way and terminals, and the like\r\nremain in the hands of private owners. The collectivist socialists are\r\nno less certain that the institution of private property necessarily\r\ngives some men an unjust advantage over others. There is no extreme of\r\nradicalism or conservatism, of individualism or socialism, of\r\nRepublicanism or Democracy, which does not rest its argument on this one\r\nconsummate principle.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, the good American finds himself in a situation similar\r\nto that with which he was confronted before the Civil War. At that time,\r\nalso, Abolitionist and slave-holder, Republican and pioneer Democrat,\r\neach of them declared himself to be the interpreter of the true\r\ndemocratic doctrine; and no substantial progress could be made towards\r\nthe settlement of the question, until public opinion had been instructed\r\nas to the real meaning of democracy in relation to the double-headed\r\nproblem of slavery and states' rights. It required the utmost\r\nintellectual courage and ability to emancipate the conception of\r\ndemocracy from the illusions and confusions of thought which enabled\r\nDavis, Douglas, and Garrison all to pose as impeccable democrats; and at\r\nthe present time reformers need to devote as much ability and more\r\ncourage to the task of framing a fitting creed for a reformed and\r\nreforming American democracy.\r\n\r\nThe political lessons of the anti-slavery and states' rights discussions\r\nmay not be of much obvious assistance in thinking out such a creed; but\r\nthey should at least help the reformers to understand the methods\r\nwhereby the purposes of a reformed democracy can be achieved. No\r\nprogress was made towards the solution of the slavery question until the\r\nquestion itself was admitted to be national in scope, and its solution a\r\nnational responsibility. No substantial progress had been made in the\r\ndirection of reform until it began to be understood that here, also, a\r\nnational responsibility existed, which demanded an exercise of the\r\npowers of the central government. Reform is both meaningless and\r\npowerless unless the Jeffersonian principle of non-interference is\r\nabandoned. The experience of the last generation plainly shows that the\r\nAmerican economic and social system cannot be allowed to take care of\r\nitself, and that the automatic harmony of the individual and the public\r\ninterest, which is the essence of the Jeffersonian democratic creed, has\r\nproved to be an illusion. Interference with the natural course of\r\nindividual and popular action there must be in the public interest; and\r\nsuch interference must at least be sufficient to accomplish its\r\npurposes. The house of the American democracy is again by way of being\r\ndivided against itself, because the national interest has not been\r\nconsistently asserted as against special and local interests; and again,\r\nalso, it can be reunited only by being partly reconstructed on better\r\nfoundations. If reform does not and cannot mean restoration, it is bound\r\nto mean reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe reformers have come partly to realize that the Jeffersonian policy\r\nof drift must be abandoned. They no longer expect the American ship of\r\nstate by virtue of its own righteous framework to sail away to a safe\r\nharbor in the Promised Land. They understand that there must be a\r\nvigorous and conscious assertion of the public as opposed to private and\r\nspecial interests, and that the American people must to a greater extent\r\nthan they have in the past subordinate the latter to the former. They\r\nbehave as if the American ship of state will hereafter require careful\r\nsteering; and a turn or two at the wheel has given them some idea of the\r\ncourse they must set. On the other hand, even the best of them have not\r\nlearned the name of its ultimate destination, the full difficulties of\r\nthe navigation, or the stern discipline which may eventually be imposed\r\nupon the ship's crew. They do not realize, that is, how thoroughly\r\nJeffersonian individualism must be abandoned for the benefit of a\r\ngenuinely individual and social consummation; and they do not realize\r\nhow dangerous and fallacious a chart their cherished principle of equal\r\nrights may well become. In reviving the practice of vigorous national\r\naction for the achievement of a national purpose, the better reformers\r\nhave, if they only knew it, been looking in the direction of a much more\r\ntrustworthy and serviceable political principle. The assumption of such\r\na responsibility implies the rejection of a large part of the\r\nJeffersonian creed, and a renewed attempt to establish in its place the\r\npopularity of its Hamiltonian rival. On the other hand, it involves no\r\nless surely the transformation of Hamiltonianism into a thoroughly\r\ndemocratic political principle. None of these inferences have, however,\r\nas yet been generally drawn, and no leading reformer has sought to give\r\nreform its necessary foundation of positive, political principle.\r\n\r\nOnly a very innocent person will expect reformers to be convinced of\r\nsuch a novel notion of reform by mere assertion, no matter how emphatic,\r\nor by argument, no matter how conclusive. But if, as I have said, reform\r\nactually implies a criticism of traditional American ideas, and a more\r\nresponsible and more positive conception of democracy, these\r\nimplications will necessarily be revealed in the future history of the\r\nreforming agitation. The reformers who understand will be assisted by\r\nthe logic of events, whereas those who cannot and will not understand\r\nwill be thwarted by the logic of events. Gradually (it may be\r\nanticipated) reformers, who dare to criticise and who are not afraid to\r\nreconstruct will be sharply distinguished from reformers who believe\r\nreform to be a species of higher conservatism. The latter will be\r\nforced where they belong into the ranks of the supporters and\r\nbeneficiaries of the existing system; and the party of genuine reform\r\nwill be strengthened by their departure. On the other hand, the sincere\r\nand thorough-going reformers can hardly avoid a division into two\r\ndivergent groups. One of these groups will stick faithfully to the\r\nprinciple of equal rights and to the spirit of the true Jeffersonian\r\nfaith. It will seek still further to undermine the representative\r\ncharacter of American institutions, to deprive official leadership of\r\nany genuine responsibility, and to cultivate individualism at the\r\nexpense of individual and national integrity. The second group, on the\r\nother hand, may learn from experience that the principle of equal rights\r\nis a dangerous weapon in the hands of factious and merely revolutionary\r\nagitators, and even that such a principle is only a partial and\r\npoverty-stricken statement of the purpose of a democratic polity. The\r\nlogic of its purposes will compel it to favor the principle of\r\nresponsible representative government, and it will seek to forge\r\ninstitutions which will endow responsible political government with\r\nrenewed life. Above all, it may discover that the attempt to unite the\r\nHamiltonian principle of national political responsibility and\r\nefficiency with a frank democratic purpose will give a new meaning to\r\nthe Hamiltonian system of political ideas and a new power to democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J. BRYAN AS A REFORMER\r\n\r\nOne would hardly dare to assert that such a future for the reforming\r\nagitation is already prophesied by the history of reform; but the\r\ndivergence between different classes of the reformers is certainly\r\nwidening, and some such alignment can already be distinguished. Hitherto\r\nI have been classing reformers together and have been occupied in\r\npointing out the merits and failings which they possess in common. Such\r\na method of treatment hardly does justice to the significance of their\r\nmutual disagreements, or to the individual value of their several\r\npersonalities and points of view. In many instances their disagreements\r\nare meaningless, and are not the result of any genuine conviction; but\r\nin other instances they do represent a relevant and significant conflict\r\nof ideas. It remains to be seen, consequently, what can be made out of\r\ntheir differences of opinion and policy, and whether they point in the\r\ndirection of a gradual transformation of the agitation for reform. For\r\nthis purpose I shall select a number of leading reformers whose work has\r\nbeen most important, and whose individual opinions are most significant,\r\nand seek some sort of an appraisal both of the comparative value of\r\ntheir work and of the promise of their characteristic ideas. The men who\r\nnaturally suggest themselves for this purpose are William J. Bryan,\r\nWilliam Travers Jerome, William Randolph Hearst, and Theodore Roosevelt.\r\nEach of these gentlemen throughout his public life has consistently\r\nstood for reform of one kind or another; and together they include\r\nalmost every popular brand or phase thereof. Reform as a practical\r\nagitation is pretty well exhausted by the points of view of these four\r\ngentlemen. They exhibit its weakness and its strength, its illusions and\r\nits good intentions, its dangerous and its salutary tendencies.\r\n\r\nBe it remarked at the outset that three of these gentlemen call\r\nthemselves Democrats, while the fourth has been the official leader of\r\nthe Republican party. The distinction to be made on this ground is\r\nsufficiently obvious, but it is also extremely important. The three\r\nDemocrats differ among themselves in certain very important respects,\r\nand these differences will receive their full share of attention.\r\nNevertheless the fact that under ordinary circumstances they affiliate\r\nwith the Democratic party and accept its traditions gives them certain\r\ncommon characteristics, and (it must be added) subjects them to certain\r\ncommon disabilities. On the other hand the fact that Theodore Roosevelt,\r\nalthough a reformer from the very beginning of his public life, has\r\nresolutely adhered to the Republican partisan organization and has\r\naccepted its peculiar traditions,--this fact, also, has largely\r\ndetermined the character and the limits of his work. These limits are\r\nplainly revealed in the opinions, the public policy, and the public\r\naction of the four typical reformers; and attempt to appraise the value\r\nof their individual opinions and their personalities must be constantly\r\nchecked by a careful consideration of the advantages or disadvantages\r\nwhich they have enjoyed or suffered from their partisan ties.\r\n\r\nMr. William J. Bryan is a fine figure of a man--amiable, winning,\r\ndisinterested, courageous, enthusiastic, genuinely patriotic, and after\r\na fashion liberal in spirit. Although he hails from Nebraska, he is in\r\ntemperament a Democrat of the Middle Period--a Democrat of the days when\r\norganization in business and politics did not count for as much as it\r\ndoes to-day, and when excellent intentions and noble sentiments embodied\r\nin big flowing words were the popular currency of American democracy.\r\nBut while an old-fashioned Democrat in temperament, he has become in\r\nideas a curious mixture of traditional democracy and modern Western\r\nradicalism; and he can, perhaps, be best understood as a Democrat of\r\nboth Jeffersonian and Jacksonian tendencies, who has been born a few\r\ngenerations too late. He is honestly seeking to deal with contemporary\r\nAmerican political problems in the spirit, if not according to the\r\nletter, of traditional democracy; but though he is making a gallant\r\nfight and a brave show, his efforts are not being rewarded with any\r\nconspicuous measure of success.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan has always been a reformer, but his programme of reform has\r\nalways been ill conceived. His first conspicuous appearance in public\r\nlife in the Democratic Convention of 1806 was occasioned by the acute\r\nand widespread economic distress among his own people west of the\r\nMississippi; and the means whereby he sought to remedy that distress,\r\nviz. by a change in the currency system, which would enable the Western\r\ndebtors partly to repudiate their debts, was a genuine result of\r\nJacksonian economic ideas. The Jacksonian Democracy, being the product\r\nof agricultural life, and being inexperienced in the complicated\r\nbusiness of finance, has always relished financial heresies. Bryan's\r\nfirst campaign was, consequently, a new assertion of a time-honored\r\ntendency of his party; and in other respects, also, he exhibited a\r\nlingering fealty to its older traditions. Reformer though he be, he has\r\nnever been much interested in civil service reform, or in any agitations\r\nlooking in the direction of the diminution of the influence of the\r\nprofessional politician. The reforms for which he has stood have been\r\neconomic, and he has had little sympathy with any thorough-going\r\nattempt to disturb even such an equivocally Democratic institution as\r\nthe spoils system. Yet his lack of sympathy with this aspect of reform\r\nwas not due to any preference for corruption. It must be traced to a\r\npersistence of the old Democratic prejudice that administrative\r\nspecialization, like other kinds of expert service, implied a\r\ndiscrimination against the average Democrat.\r\n\r\nAfter the revival of prosperity among his own people had shown that\r\npartial repudiation was not the only cure for poverty, Mr. Bryan fought\r\nhis second campaign chiefly on the issue of imperialism, and again met\r\nwith defeat. But in this instance his platform was influenced more by\r\nJeffersonian than Jacksonian ideas. The Jacksonian Democracy had always\r\nbeen expansionist in disposition and policy, and under the influence of\r\ntheir nationalism they had lost interest in Jefferson's humanitarianism.\r\nIn this matter, however, Mr. Bryan has shown more sympathy with the\r\nfirst than with the second phase of the Democratic tradition; and in\r\nmaking this choice he was undoubtedly more faithful to the spirit and\r\nthe letter of the Democratic creed than were the expansionist Democrats\r\nof the Middle Period. The traditional American democracy has frequently\r\nbeen national in feeling, but it has never been national in idea and\r\npurpose. In the campaign of 1900 Mr. Bryan committed himself and his\r\nparty to an anti-national point of view; and no matter how well\r\nintentioned and consistent he was in so doing, he made a second mistake,\r\neven more disastrous than the first. In seeking to prevent his\r\ncountrymen from asserting their national interest beyond their own\r\ncontinent, he was also opposing in effect the resolute assertion of the\r\nnational interest in domestic affairs. He stamped himself, that is, as\r\nan anti-nationalist, and his anti-nationalism has disqualified him for\r\neffective leadership of the party of reform.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan's anti-nationalism is peculiarly embarrassing to his political\r\nefficiency just because he is, as I have indicated, in many of his ideas\r\nan advanced contemporary radical. He is, indeed, more of a radical than\r\nany other political leader of similar prominence; and his radicalism is\r\nthe result of a sincere and a candid attempt to think out a satisfactory\r\nsolution of the contemporary economic and political problems. As a\r\nresult of these reflections he dared to advocate openly and\r\nunequivocally the public ownership of the railway system of the country;\r\nand he has proposed, also, a measure of Federal regulation of\r\ncorporations, conducting an inter-state business, much more drastic than\r\nthat of Mr. Roosevelt. These proposed increases of Federal\r\nresponsibility and power would have been considered outrageous by an\r\nold-fashioned Democrat; and they indicate on the part of Mr. Bryan an\r\nunusually liberal and courageous mind. But the value and effect of his\r\nradicalism is seriously impaired by the manner in which it is qualified.\r\nHe proposes in one breath enormous increases of Federal power and\r\nresponsibility, and in the next betrays the old Democratic distrust of\r\neffective national organization. He is willing to grant power to the\r\nFederal authorities, but he denies them any confidence, because of the\r\ndemocratic tradition of an essential conflict between political\r\nauthority, particularly so far as it is centralized, and the popular\r\ninterest. He is incapable of adapting his general political theories to\r\nhis actual political programme; and, consequently, the utmost personal\r\nenthusiasm on his part and great power of effective political agitation\r\ncannot give essential coherence, substantial integrity, or triumphant\r\neffect to his campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe incoherence of his political thinking is best exemplified by the way\r\nin which he proposed to nationalize the American railway system. His\r\nadvocacy of public ownership was the most courageous act of his\r\npolitical career; but he soon showed that he was prepared neither to\r\ninsist upon such a policy nor even to carry it to a logical conclusion.\r\nAlmost as soon as the words were out of his mouth, he became horrified\r\nat his own audacity and sought to mitigate its effects. He admitted that\r\nthe centralization of so much power was dangerous, and he sought to make\r\nthese dangers less by proposing that the states appropriate the\r\nrailroads operating within the boundaries of one state, and the central\r\ngovernment, only the large inter-state systems. But this qualification\r\ndestroyed the effect of his Federalist audacity. The inter-state\r\nrailroads constitute such an enormous percentage of the total mileage of\r\nthe country that if centralized governmental control was dangerous for\r\nall the railroads of the country, it would be almost equally dangerous\r\nfor that proportion of the railway mileage operated as part of\r\ninter-state systems. In the one and the same speech, that is, Mr. Bryan\r\nplaced himself on record as a radical centralizer of economic and\r\npolitical power and as a man who was on general principles afraid of\r\ncentralization and opposed to it. No wonder public opinion did not take\r\nhis proposal seriously, and no wonder he himself has gradually dropped\r\nit out of his practical programme.\r\n\r\nThe confusion and inconsistency of Mr. Bryan's own thinking is merely\r\nthe reflection of the confusion and inconsistency resident in the creed\r\nof his party. It is particularly conspicuous in his case, because he is,\r\nas I have intimated, a sincere and within limits a candid thinker; but\r\nJeffersonian and Jacksonian Democrats alike have always distrusted and\r\ncondemned the means whereby alone the underlying purposes of democracy\r\ncan be fulfilled. Mr. Bryan is in no respect more genuinely Democratic\r\nthan in his incoherence. The remedial policy which he proposes for the\r\nills of the American political body are meaningless, unless sustained by\r\nfaith in the ability of the national political organization to promote\r\nthe national welfare. His needs for the success and integrity of his own\r\npolicy a conviction which his traditions prevent him from entertaining.\r\nHe is possessed by the time-honored Democratic dislike of organization\r\nand of the faith in expert skill, in specialized training, and in large\r\npersonal opportunities and responsibilities which are implied by a trust\r\nin organization. Of course he himself would deny that he was the enemy\r\nof anything which made towards human betterment, for it is\r\ncharacteristic of the old-fashioned Democrats verbally to side with the\r\nangels, but at the same time to insist on clipping their wings. His\r\nfundamental prejudice against efficient organization and personal\r\nindependence is plainly betrayed by his opinions in relation to\r\ninstitutional reform--which are absolutely those of a Democrat of the\r\nMiddle Period. He is on record in favor of destroying the independence\r\nof the Federal judiciary by making it elective, of diminishing the\r\nauthority of the President by allowing him only a suspensive veto on\r\nlegislation, and of converting representative assemblies into a\r\nmachinery, like that of the old French Parliaments, for merely\r\nregistering the Sovereign will. Faith in the people and confidence in\r\npopular government means to Mr. Bryan an utter lack of faith in those\r\npersonal instruments whereby such rule can be endowed with foresight,\r\nmoderation, and direction. Confidence in the average man, that is, means\r\nto him distrust in the exceptional man, or in any sort of organization\r\nwhich bestows on the exceptional man an opportunity equal to his ability\r\nand equipment. He stands for the sacrifice of the individual to the\r\npopular average; and the perpetuation of such a sacrifice would mean\r\nultimate democratic degeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWILLIAM TRAVERS JEROME AS A REFORMER\r\n\r\nMr. William Travers Jerome has not so assured a rank in the hierarchy of\r\nreformers as he had a few years ago, but his work and his point of view\r\nremain typical and significant. Unlike Mr. Bryan, he is in temperament\r\nand sympathies far from being an old-fashioned Democrat. He is, as his\r\nofficial expositor, the late Mr. Alfred Hodder, says, \"a typical\r\nAmerican of the new time.\" No old-fashioned Democrat would have smoked\r\ncigarettes, tossed dice in public for drinks, and \"handed out\" slang to\r\nhis constituents; and his unconventionally in these respects is merely\r\nan occasional expression of a novel, individual, and refreshing point of\r\nview. Mr. Jerome alone among American politicians has made a specialty\r\nof plain speaking. He has revolted against the tradition in our politics\r\nwhich seeks to stop every leak with a good intention and plaster every\r\nsore with a \"decorative phrase.\" He has, says Mr. Hodder, \"a partly\r\nGallic passion for intellectual veracity, for a clear recognition of the\r\nfacts before him, however ugly, and a wholly Gallic hatred of\r\nhypocrisy.\" It is Mr. Jerome's intellectual veracity, his somewhat\r\nconscious and strenuous ideal of plain speaking, which has been his\r\npersonal contribution to the cause of reform; and he is right in\r\nbelieving it to be a very important contribution. The effective work of\r\nreform, as has already been pointed out, demands on the part of its\r\nleaders the intellectual virtues of candor, consistency, and a clear\r\nrecognition of facts. In Mr. Jerome's own case his candor and his clear\r\nrecognition of facts have been used almost exclusively in the field of\r\nmunicipal reform. He has vigorously protested against existing laws\r\nwhich have been passed in obedience to a rigorous puritanism, which,\r\nbecause of their defiance of stubborn facts, can scarcely be enforced,\r\nand whose statutory existence merely provides an opportunity for the\r\n\"grafter.\" He has clearly discerned that in seeking the amendment of\r\nsuch laws he is obliged to fight, not merely an unwise statute, but an\r\nerroneous, superficial, and hypocritical state of mind. Although it may\r\nhave been his own official duty as district attorney to see that certain\r\nlaws are enforced and to prosecute the law breakers, he fully realizes\r\nthat municipal reform at least will never attain its ends until the\r\npublic--the respectable, well-to-do, church-going public--is converted\r\nto an abandonment of what Mr. Hodder calls administrative lying.\r\nConsequently his intellectual candor is more than a personal\r\npeculiarity--more even than an extremely effective method of popular\r\nagitation. It is the expression of a deeper aspect of reform, which many\r\nrespectable reformers, not merely ignore, but fear and reprobate,--an\r\naspect of reform which can never prevail until the reformers themselves\r\nare subjected to a process of purgation and education.\r\n\r\nIt has happened, however, that Mr. Jerome's reputation and successes\r\nhave been won in the field of local politics; and, unfortunately, as\r\nsoon as he transgressed the boundaries of that field, he lost his\r\nefficiency, his insight, and, to my mind, his interest. Only a year\r\nafter he was elected to the district attorneyship of New York County, in\r\nspite of the opposition both of Tammany and William R. Hearst, he\r\noffered himself as a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial\r\nnomination of New York on the comprehensive platform of his oath of\r\noffice; but in the larger arena his tactics proved to be ineffective,\r\nand his recent popularity of small avail. He cut no figure at all in the\r\nconvention, and a very insignificant one outside. Neither was there any\r\nreason to be surprised at this result. In municipal politics he stood\r\nfor an ideal and a method of agitation which was both individual and of\r\ngreat value. In state and national politics he stood for nothing\r\nindividual, for nothing of peculiar value, for no specific group of\r\nideas or scheme of policy. The announcement that a candidate's platform\r\nconsists of his oath of office doubtless has a full persuasive sound to\r\nmany Americans; but it was none the less on Mr. Jerome's part an inept\r\nand meaningless performance. He was bidding for support merely on the\r\nground that he was an honest man who proposed to keep his word; but\r\nhonesty and good faith are qualities which the public have a right to\r\ntake for granted in their officials, and no candidate can lay peculiar\r\nclaim to them without becoming politically sanctimonious. Mr. Hearst's\r\nstrength consisted in the fact that he had for years stood for a\r\nparticular group of ideas and a particular attitude of mind towards the\r\nproblems of state and national politics, while Mr. Jerome's weakness\r\nconsisted in the fact that he had never really tried to lead public\r\nopinion in relation to state and national political problems, and that\r\nhe was obliged to claim support on the score of personal moral\r\nsuperiority to his opponent. The moral superiority may be admitted; but\r\nalone it never would and never should contribute to his election. In\r\ntimes like these a reformer must identify a particular group of remedial\r\nmeasures with his public personality. The public has a right to know in\r\nwhat definite ways a reformer's righteousness is to be made effective;\r\nand Mr. Jerome has never taken any vigorous and novel line in relation\r\nto the problems of state and national politics. When he speaks on those\r\nsubjects, he loses his vivacity, and betrays in his thinking a tendency\r\nto old-fashioned Democracy far beyond that of Mr. Bryan. He becomes in\r\nhis opinions eminently respectable and tolerably dull, which is, as the\r\nlate Mr. Alfred Hodder could have told him, quite out of keeping with\r\nthe part of a \"New American.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jerome has never given the smallest evidence of having taken serious\r\nindependent thought on our fundamental political problems. In certain\r\npoints of detail respecting general political questions he has shown a\r\nrefreshing freedom from conventional illusions; but, so far as I know,\r\nno public word has ever escaped him, which indicates that he has applied\r\nhis \"ideal of intellectual veracity,\" \"his Gallic instinct for\r\nconsistency,\" to the creed of his own party. When confronted by the\r\nfabric of traditional Jeffersonian Democracy, his mind, like that of so\r\nmany other Democrats, is immediately lulled into repose. In one of his\r\nspeeches, for instance, he has referred to his party as essentially the\r\nparty of \"liberal ideas,\" and he was much praised by the anti-Hearst\r\nnewspapers for this consoling description; but it can hardly be\r\nconsidered as an illustration of Mr. Jerome's \"intellectual veracity.\"\r\nIf by \"liberal ideas\" one means economic and political heresies, such as\r\nnullification, \"squatter\" sovereignty, secession, free silver, and\r\noccasional projects of repudiation, then, indeed, the Democracy has\r\nbeen a party of \"liberal ideas.\" But heresies of this kind are not the\r\nexpression of liberal thought; they are the result of various phases of\r\nlocal political and economic discontent. When a group of Democrats\r\nbecome \"liberal,\" it usually means that they are doing a bad business,\r\nor are suffering from a real or supposed injury. But if by \"liberal\" we\r\nmean, not merely radical and subversive, but progressive national ideas,\r\nthe application of the adjective to the Democratic party is attended\r\nwith certain difficulties. In the course of American history what\r\nmeasure of legislation expressive of a progressive national idea can be\r\nattributed to the Democratic party? At times it has been possessed by\r\ncertain revolutionary tendencies; at other times it has been steeped in\r\nBourbon conservatism. At present it is alternating between one and the\r\nother, according to the needs and opportunities of the immediate\r\npolitical situation. It is trying to find room within its hospitable\r\nfolds for both Alton B. Parker and William J. Bryan, and it has such an\r\nappetite for inconsistencies that it may succeed. But in that event one\r\nwould expect some symptoms of uneasiness on the part of a Democratic\r\nreformer with \"Gallic clearness and consistency of mind, with an\r\ninstinct for consistency, and a hatred of hypocrisy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWILLIAM R. HEARST AS A REFORMER\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Mr. William R. Hearst offers his countrymen a fair\r\nexpression of the kind of \"liberal ideas\" proper to the creed of\r\ndemocracy. In respect to patriotism and personal character Mr. Bryan is\r\na better example of the representative Democrat than is Mr. Hearst; but\r\nin the tendency and spirit of his agitation for reform Hearst more\r\ncompletely reveals the true nature of Democratic \"liberalism.\" When Mr.\r\nLincoln Steffens asserts on the authority of the \"man of mystery\"\r\nhimself that one of Hearst's mysterious actions has been a profound and\r\nsearching study of Jeffersonian doctrine, I can almost bring myself to\r\nbelieve the assertion. The radicalism of Hearst is simply an\r\nunscrupulous expression of the radical element in the Jeffersonian\r\ntradition. He bases his whole agitation upon the sacred idea of equal\r\nrights for all and special privileges for none, and he indignantly\r\ndisclaims the taint of socialism. His specific remedial proposals do not\r\ndiffer essentially from those of Mr. Bryan. His methods of agitation and\r\nhis popular catch words are an ingenious adaptation of Jefferson to the\r\nneeds of political \"yellow journalism.\" He is always an advocate of the\r\npopular fact. He always detests the unpopular word. He approves\r\nexpansion, but abhors imperialism. He welcomes any opportunity for war,\r\nbut execrates militarism. He wants the Federal government to crush the\r\ntrusts by the most drastic legislation, but he is opposed to\r\ncentralization. The institutional reforms which he favors all of them\r\nlook in the direction of destroying what remains of judicial, executive,\r\nor legislative independence. The whole programme is as incoherent as is\r\nthat of Mr. Bryan; but incoherence is the least of his faults. Mr.\r\nBryan's inconsistencies are partly redeemed by his genuine patriotism.\r\nThe distracting effect of Hearst's inconsistencies is intensified by his\r\nfactiousness. He is more and less than a radical. He is in temper a\r\nrevolutionist. The disgust and distrust which he excites is the issue of\r\na wholesome political and social instinct, for the political instincts\r\nof the American people are often much sounder than their ideas. Hearst\r\nand Hearstism is a living menace to the orderly process of reform and to\r\nAmerican national integrity.\r\n\r\nHearst is revolutionary in spirit, because the principle of equal rights\r\nitself, in the hand either of a fanatic or a demagogue, can be converted\r\ninto a revolutionary principle. He considers, as do all reformers, the\r\nprevalent inequalities of economic and political power to be violations\r\nof that principle. He also believes in the truth of American political\r\nindividualism, and in the adequacy, except in certain minor respects, of\r\nour systems of inherited institutions. How, then, did these inequalities\r\ncome about? How did the Democratic political system of Jefferson and\r\nJackson issue in undemocratic inequalities? The answer is obviously (and\r\nit is an answer drawn by other reformers) that these inequalities are\r\nthe work of wicked and unscrupulous men. Financial or political pirates\r\nof one kind or another have been preying on the guileless public, and by\r\nmeans of their aggressions have perversely violated the supreme law of\r\nequal rights. These men must be exposed; they must be denounced as\r\nenemies of the people; they must be held up to public execration and\r\nscorn; they must become the objects of a righteous popular vengeance.\r\nSuch are the feelings and ideas which possess the followers of Hearst,\r\nand on the basis of which Hearst himself acts and talks. An apparent\r\njustification is reached for a systematic vilification of the trusts,\r\nthe \"predatory\" millionaires and their supporters; and such vilification\r\nhas become Hearst's peculiar stock in trade. In effect he treats his\r\nopponents very much as the French revolutionary leaders treated their\r\nopponents, so that in case the conflict should become still more\r\nembittered, his \"reformed\" democracy may resemble the purified republic\r\nof which Robespierre and St. Just dreamed when they sent Desmoulins and\r\nDanton to the guillotine. When he embodies such ideas and betrays such a\r\nspirit, the disputed point as to Hearst's sincerity sinks into\r\ninsignificance. A fanatic sincerely possessed by these ideas is a more\r\ndangerous menace to American national integrity and the Promise of\r\nAmerican democracy than the sheerest demagogue.\r\n\r\nThe logic of Hearst's agitation is analogous to the logic of the\r\nanti-slavery agitation in 1830, and Hearstism is merely Abolitionism\r\napplied to a new material and translated into rowdy journalism. The\r\nAbolitionists, believing as they did, that the institution of slavery\r\nviolated an abstract principle of political justice, felt thereby fully\r\nauthorized to vilify the Southern slaveholders as far as the resources\r\nof the English language would permit. They attempted to remedy one\r\ninjustice by committing another injustice; and by the violence of their\r\nmethods they almost succeeded in tearing apart the good fabric of our\r\nnational life. Hearst is headed in precisely the same direction. He is\r\ndoing a radical injustice to a large body of respectable American\r\ncitizens who, like Hearst himself, have merely shown a certain lack of\r\nscruple in taking advantage of the opportunities which the American\r\npolitical and economic system offers, and who have been distinguished\r\nrather by peculiar ability and energy than by peculiar selfishness. On a\r\nrigid interpretation of the principle of equal rights he may be\r\njustified in holding them up to public execration, just as the\r\nAbolitionists, on the principle that the right to freedom was a Divine\r\nlaw, might be justified in vilifying the Southerners. But as a matter of\r\nfact we know that personally neither the millionaire nor the\r\nslave-holder deserves such denunciation; and we ought to know that the\r\nprejudices and passions provoked by language of this kind violate the\r\nessential principle both of nationality and democracy. The foundation of\r\nnationality is mutual confidence and fair dealing, and the aim of\r\ndemocracy is a better quality of human nature effected by a higher type\r\nof human association. Hearstism, like Abolitionism, is the work of\r\nunbalanced and vindictive men, and increases enormously the difficulty\r\nof the wise and effective cure of the contemporary evils.\r\n\r\nYet Hearst, as little as the millionaires he denounces, is not entirely\r\nresponsible for himself. Such a responsibility would be too heavy for\r\nthe shoulders of one man. He has been given to the American people for\r\ntheir sins in politics and economics. His opponents may scold him as\r\nmuch as they please. They may call him a demagogue and a charlatan; they\r\nmay accuse him of corrupting the public mind and pandering to degrading\r\npassions; they may declare that his abusive attacks on the late Mr.\r\nMcKinley were at least indirectly the cause of that gentleman's\r\nassassination; they may, in short, behave and talk as if he were a much\r\nmore dangerous public enemy than the most \"tainted\" millionaire or the\r\nmost corrupt politician. Nevertheless they cannot deprive him or his\r\nimitators of the standing to be obtained from the proclamation of a\r\nrigorous interpretation of the principle of equal rights. Hearst has\r\nunderstood that principle better than the other reformers, or the\r\nconservatives who claim its authority. He has exhibited its\r\ndisintegrating and revolutionary implications; and he has convinced a\r\nlarge, though fluctuating, following that he is only fighting for\r\njustice. He personally may or may not have run his course, but it is\r\nmanifest that his peculiar application of the principle of equal rights\r\nto our contemporary economic and political problems has come to stay. As\r\nlong as that principle keeps its present high position in the hierarchy\r\nof American political ideas, just so long will it afford authority and\r\ncountenance to agitators like Hearst. He is not a passing danger, which\r\nwill disappear in case the truly Herculean efforts to discredit him\r\npersonally continue to be successful. Just as slavery was the ghost in\r\nthe House of the American Democracy during the Middle Period, so\r\nHearstism is and will remain the ghost in the House of Reform. And the\r\nincantation by which it will be permanently exorcised has not yet been\r\npublicly phrased.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT AS A REFORMER\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate, consequently, that one reformer can be named whose work\r\nhas tended to give reform the dignity of a constructive mission. Mr.\r\nTheodore Roosevelt's behavior at least is not dictated by negative\r\nconception of reform. During the course of an extremely active and\r\nvaried political career he has, indeed, been all kinds of a reformer.\r\nHis first appearance in public life, as a member of the Legislature of\r\nNew York, coincided with an outbreak of dissatisfaction over the charter\r\nof New York City; and Mr. Roosevelt's name was identified with the bills\r\nwhich began the revision of that very much revised instrument. Somewhat\r\nlater, as one of the Federal Commissioners, Mr. Roosevelt made a most\r\nuseful contribution to the more effective enforcement of the Civil\r\nService Law. Still later, as Police Commissioner of New York City, he\r\nhad his experience of reform by means of unregenerate instruments and\r\nadministrative lies. Then, as Governor of the State of New York, he was\r\ninstrumental in securing the passage of a law taxing franchises as real\r\nproperty and thus faced for the first time and in a preliminary way the\r\nmany-headed problem of the trusts. Finally, when an accident placed him\r\nin the Presidential chair, he consistently used the power of the Federal\r\ngovernment and his own influence and popularity for the purpose of\r\nregulating the corporations in what he believed to be the public\r\ninterest. No other American has had anything like so varied and so\r\nintimate an acquaintance with the practical work of reform as has Mr.\r\nRoosevelt; and when, after more than twenty years of such experience, he\r\nadds to the work of administrative reform the additional task of\r\npolitical and economic reconstruction, his originality cannot be\r\nconsidered the result of innocence. Mr. Roosevelt's reconstructive\r\npolicy does not go very far in purpose or achievement, but limited as it\r\nis, it does tend to give the agitation for reform the benefit of a much\r\nmore positive significance and a much more dignified task.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt has imparted a higher and more positive significance to\r\nreform, because throughout his career he has consistently stood for an\r\nidea, from which the idea of reform cannot be separated--namely, the\r\nnational idea. He has, indeed, been even more of a nationalist than he\r\nhas a reformer. His most important literary work was a history of the\r\nbeginning of American national expansion. He has treated all public\r\nquestions from a vigorous, even from an extreme, national standpoint. No\r\nAmerican politician was more eager to assert the national interest\r\nagainst an actual or a possible foreign enemy; and not even William R.\r\nHearst was more resolute to involve his country in a war with Spain.\r\nFortunately, however, his aggressive nationalism did not, like that of\r\nso many other statesmen, faint from exhaustion as soon as there were no\r\nmore foreign enemies to defy. He was the first political leader of the\r\nAmerican people to identify the national principle with an ideal of\r\nreform. He was the first to realize that an American statesman could no\r\nlonger really represent the national interest without becoming a\r\nreformer. Mr. Grover Cleveland showed a glimmering of the necessity of\r\nthis affiliation; but he could not carry it far, because, as a sincere\r\ntraditional Democrat, he could not reach a clear understanding of the\r\nmeaning either of reform or of nationality. Mr. Roosevelt, however,\r\ndivined that an American statesman who eschewed or evaded the work of\r\nreform came inevitably to represent either special and local interests\r\nor else a merely Bourbon political tradition, and in this way was\r\ndisqualified for genuinely national service. He divined that the\r\nnational principle involved a continual process of internal reformation;\r\nand that the reforming idea implied the necessity of more efficient\r\nnational organization. Consequently, when he became President of the\r\nUnited States and the official representative of the national interest\r\nof the country, he attained finally his proper sphere of action. He\r\nimmediately began the salutary and indispensable work of nationalizing\r\nthe reform movement.\r\n\r\nThe nationalization of reform endowed the movement with new vitality and\r\nmeaning. What Mr. Roosevelt really did was to revive the Hamiltonian\r\nideal of constructive national legislation. During the whole of the\r\nnineteenth century that ideal, while by no means dead, was disabled by\r\nassociations and conditions from active and efficient service. Not until\r\nthe end of the Spanish War was a condition of public feeling created,\r\nwhich made it possible to revive Hamiltonianism. That war and its\r\nresulting policy of extra-territorial expansion, so far from hindering\r\nthe process of domestic amelioration, availed, from the sheer force of\r\nthe national aspirations it aroused, to give a tremendous impulse to the\r\nwork of national reform. It made Americans more sensitive to a national\r\nidea and more conscious of their national responsibilities, and it\r\nindirectly helped to place in the Presidential chair the man who, as I\r\nhave said, represented both the national idea and the spirit of reform.\r\nThe sincere and intelligent combination of those two ideas is bound to\r\nissue in the Hamiltonian practice of constructive national legislation.\r\n\r\nOf course Theodore Roosevelt is Hamiltonian with a difference.\r\nHamilton's fatal error consisted in his attempt to make the Federal\r\norganization not merely the effective engine of the national interest,\r\nbut also a bulwark against the rising tide of democracy. The new\r\nFederalism or rather new Nationalism is not in any way inimical to\r\ndemocracy. On the contrary, not only does Mr. Roosevelt believe himself\r\nto be an unimpeachable democrat in theory, but he has given his\r\nfellow-countrymen a useful example of the way in which a college-bred\r\nand a well-to-do man can become by somewhat forcible means a good\r\npractical democrat. The whole tendency of his programme is to give a\r\ndemocratic meaning and purpose to the Hamiltonian tradition and method.\r\nHe proposes to use the power and the resources of the Federal government\r\nfor the purpose of making his countrymen a more complete democracy in\r\norganization and practice; but he does not make these proposals, as Mr.\r\nBryan does, gingerly and with a bad conscience. He makes them with a\r\nfrank and full confidence in an efficient national organization as the\r\nnecessary agent of the national interest and purpose. He has completely\r\nabandoned that part of the traditional democratic creed which tends to\r\nregard the assumption by the government of responsibility, and its\r\nendowment with power adequate to the responsibility as inherently\r\ndangerous and undemocratic. He realizes that any efficiency of\r\norganization and delegation of power which is necessary to the\r\npromotion of the American national interest must be helpful to\r\ndemocracy. More than any other American political leader, except\r\nLincoln, his devotion both to the national and to the democratic ideas\r\nis thorough-going and absolute.\r\n\r\nAs the founder of a new national democracy, then, his influence and his\r\nwork have tended to emancipate American democracy from its Jeffersonian\r\nbondage. They have tended to give a new meaning to popular government by\r\nendowing it with larger powers, more positive responsibilities, and a\r\nbetter faith in human excellence. Jefferson believed theoretically in\r\nhuman goodness, but in actual practice his faith in human nature was\r\nexceedingly restricted. Just as the older aristocratic theory had been\r\nto justify hereditary political leadership by considering the ordinary\r\nman as necessarily irresponsible and incapable, so the early French\r\ndemocrats, and Jefferson after them, made faith in the people equivalent\r\nto a profound suspicion of responsible official leadership. Exceptional\r\npower merely offered exceptional opportunities for abuse. He refused, as\r\nfar as he could, to endow special men, even when chosen by the people,\r\nwith any opportunity to promote the public welfare proportionate to\r\ntheir abilities. So far as his influence has prevailed the government of\r\nthe country was organized on the basis of a cordial distrust of the man\r\nof exceptional competence, training, or independence as a public\r\nofficial. To the present day this distrust remains the sign by which the\r\ndemoralizing influence of the Jeffersonian democratic creed is most\r\nplainly to be traced. So far as it continues to be influential it\r\ndestroys one necessary condition of responsible and efficient\r\ngovernment, and it is bound to paralyze any attempt to make the national\r\norganization adequate to the promotion of the national interest. Mr.\r\nRoosevelt has exhibited his genuinely national spirit in nothing so\r\nclearly as in his endeavor to give to men of special ability, training,\r\nand eminence a better opportunity to serve the public. He has not only\r\nappointed such men to office, but he has tried to supply them with an\r\nadministrative machinery which would enable them to use their abilities\r\nto the best public advantage; and he has thereby shown a faith in human\r\nnature far more edifying and far more genuinely democratic than that of\r\nJefferson or Jackson.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt, however, has still another title to distinction among the\r\nbrethren of reform. He has not only nationalized the movement, and\r\npointed it in the direction of a better conception of democracy, but he\r\nhas rallied to its hammer the ostensible, if not the very enthusiastic,\r\nsupport of the Republican party. He has restored that party to some\r\nsense of its historic position and purpose. As the party which before\r\nthe War had insisted on making the nation answerable for the solution of\r\nthe slavery problem, it has inherited the tradition of national\r\nresponsibility for the national good; but it was rapidly losing all\r\nsense of its historic mission, and, like the Whigs, was constantly using\r\nits principle and its prestige as a cloak for the aggrandizement of\r\nspecial interests. At its worst it had, indeed, earned some claim on the\r\nallegiance of patriotic Americans by its defense of the fiscal system of\r\nthe country against Mr. Bryan's well-meant but dangerous attack, and by\r\nits acceptance after the Spanish War of the responsibilities of\r\nextra-territorial expansion; but there was grave danger that its\r\nalliance with the \"vested\" interests would make it unfaithful to its\r\npast as the party of responsible national action. It escaped such a fate\r\nonly by an extremely narrow margin; and the fact that it did escape is\r\ndue chiefly to the personal influence of Theodore Roosevelt. The\r\nRepublican party is still very far from being a wholly sincere agent of\r\nthe national reform interest. Its official leadership is opposed to\r\nreform; and it cannot be made to take a single step in advance except\r\nunder compulsion. But Mr. Roosevelt probably prevented it from drifting\r\ninto the position of an anti-reform party--which if it had happened\r\nwould have meant its ruin, and would have damaged the cause of national\r\nreform. A Republican party which was untrue to the principle of national\r\nresponsibility would have no reason for existence; and the Democratic\r\nparty, as we have seen, cannot become the party of national\r\nresponsibility without being faithless to its own creed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\nBefore finishing this account of Mr. Roosevelt's services as a reformer,\r\nand his place in the reforming movement, a serious objection on the\r\nscore of consistency must be fairly faced. Even admitting that Mr.\r\nRoosevelt has dignified reform by identifying it with a programme of\r\nconstructive national legislation, does the fundamental purpose of his\r\nreforming legislation differ essentially from that of Mr. Bryan or Mr.\r\nHearst? How can he be called the founder of a new national democracy\r\nwhen the purpose of democracy from his point of view remains\r\nsubstantially the Jeffersonian ideal of equal rights for all and special\r\nprivileges for none? If, in one respect, he has been emancipating\r\nAmerican democracy from the Jeffersonian bondage, he has in another\r\nrespect been tightening the bonds, because he has continued to identify\r\ndemocracy with the legal constitution of a system of insurgent,\r\nambiguous, and indiscriminate individual rights.\r\n\r\nThe validity of such a criticism from the point of view of this book\r\ncannot be disputed. The figure of the \"Square Deal,\" which Mr. Roosevelt\r\nhas flourished so vigorously in public addresses, is a translation into\r\nthe American vernacular of the Jeffersonian principle of equal rights;\r\nand in Mr. Roosevelt's dissertations upon the American ideal he has\r\nexpressly disclaimed the notion of any more positive definition of the\r\npurpose of American democracy. Moreover, his favorite figure gives a\r\nsinister application to his assertions that the principle of equal\r\nrights is being violated. If the American people are not getting a\r\n\"Square Deal,\" it must mean that they are having the cards stacked\r\nagainst them; and in that case the questions of paramount importance\r\nare: Who are stacking the cards? And how can they be punished? These are\r\nprecisely the questions which Hearst is always asking and Hearstism is\r\nseeking to answer. Neither has Mr. Roosevelt himself entirely escaped\r\nthe misleading effects of his own figure. He has too frequently talked\r\nas if his opponents deserved to be treated as dishonest sharpers; and he\r\nhas sometimes behaved as if his suspicions of unfair play on their part\r\nwere injuring the coolness of his judgment. But at bottom and in the\r\nlong run Mr. Roosevelt is too fair-minded a man and too patriotic a\r\ncitizen to become much the victim of his dangerous figure of the \"Square\r\nDeal.\" He inculcates for the most part in his political sermons a\r\nspirit, not of suspicion and hatred, but of mutual forbearance and\r\nconfidence; and his programme of reform attaches more importance to a\r\nrevision of the rules of the game than to the treatment of the winners\r\nunder the old rules as one would treat a dishonest gambler.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Mr. Roosevelt has been building either better than he knows or\r\nbetter than he cares to admit. The real meaning of his programme is more\r\nnovel and more radical than he himself has publicly proclaimed. It\r\nimplies a conception of democracy and its purpose very different from\r\nthe Jeffersonian doctrine of equal rights. Evidences of deep antagonism\r\ncan be discerned between the Hamiltonian method and spirit, represented\r\nby Mr. Roosevelt, and a conception of democracy which makes it consist\r\nfundamentally in the practical realization of any system of equal\r\nrights. The distrust with which thorough-going Jeffersonians regard Mr.\r\nRoosevelt's nationalizing programme is a justifiable distrust, because\r\nefficient and responsible national organization would be dangerous\r\neither to or in the sort of democracy which the doctrine of equal rights\r\nencourages--a democracy of suspicious discontent, of selfish claims, of\r\nfactious agitation, and of individual and class aggression. A thoroughly\r\nresponsible and efficient national organization would be dangerous in\r\nsuch a democracy, because it might well be captured by some combination\r\nof local individual or class interests; and the only effective way to\r\nguard against such a danger is to substitute for the Jeffersonian\r\ndemocracy of individual rights a democracy of individual and social\r\nimprovement. A democracy of individual rights, that is, must either\r\nsuffer reconstruction by the logic of a process of efficient national\r\norganization, or else it may pervert that organization to the service of\r\nits own ambiguous, contradictory, and in the end subversive political\r\npurposes. A better justification for these statements must be reserved\r\nfor the succeeding chapter; but in the meantime I will take the risk\r\nasserting that Mr. Roosevelt's nationalism really implies a democracy of\r\nindividual and social improvement. His nationalizing programme has in\r\neffect questioned the value of certain fundamental American ideas, and\r\nif Mr. Roosevelt has not himself outgrown these ideas, his misreading of\r\nhis own work need not be a matter of surprise. It is what one would\r\nexpect from the prophet of the Strenuous Life.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt has done little to encourage candid and consistent\r\nthinking. He has preached the doctrine that the paramount and almost the\r\nexclusive duty of the American citizen consists in being a\r\nsixty-horse-power moral motor-car. In his own career his intelligence\r\nhas been the handmaid of his will; and the balance between those\r\nfaculties, so finely exemplified in Abraham Lincoln, has been destroyed\r\nby sheer exuberance of moral energy. But although his intelligence is\r\nmerely the servant of his will, it is at least the willing and competent\r\nservant of a single-minded master. If it has not been leavened by the\r\nrigorous routine of its work, neither has it been cheapened; and the\r\nservice has constantly been growing better worth while. During the\r\ncourse of his public career, his original integrity of character\r\nhas been intensified by the stress of his labors, his achievements,\r\nhis experiences, and his exhortations. An individuality such as\r\nhis--wrought with so much consistent purpose out of much variety of\r\nexperience--brings with it an intellectual economy of its own and a\r\nsincere and useful sort of intellectual enlightenment. He may be figured\r\nas a Thor wielding with power and effect a sledge-hammer in the cause of\r\nnational righteousness; and the sympathetic observer, who is not stunned\r\nby the noise of the hammer, may occasionally be rewarded by the sight of\r\nsomething more illuminating than a piece of rebellious metal beaten into\r\nshape. He may be rewarded by certain unexpected gleams of insight, as if\r\nthe face of the sledge-hammer were worn bright by hard service and\r\nflashed in the sunlight. Mr. Roosevelt sees as far ahead and as much as\r\nhe needs to see. He has an almost infallible sense of where to strike\r\nthe next important blow, and even during the ponderous labors of the day\r\nhe prudently and confidently lays out the task of to-morrow. Thus while\r\nhe has contributed to the liberation of American intelligence chiefly in\r\nthe sense that he has given his fellow-countrymen something to think\r\nabout, he is very far from being a blind, narrow, or unenlightened\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the only practical road of advance at present is laborious,\r\nslow, and not too enlightened. For the time being the hammer is a\r\nmightier weapon than the sword or the pen. Americans have the habit of\r\naction rather than of thought. Like their forbears in England, they\r\nbegin to do things, because their common sense tells them that such\r\nthings have to be done, and then at a later date think over the\r\naccomplished fact. A man in public life who told them that their \"noble\r\nnational theory\" was ambiguous and distracting, and that many of their\r\npopular catchwords were false and exercised a mischievous influence on\r\npublic affairs, would do so at his own personal risk and cost. The task\r\nof plain speaking must be suggested and justified by the achievement of\r\na considerable body of national reconstructive legislation, and must\r\neven then devolve largely upon men who have from the political point of\r\nview little to gain or to lose by their apparent heresies. The fact,\r\nhowever, that a responsible politician like Mr. Roosevelt must be an\r\nexample more of moral than of intellectual independence, increases\r\nrather than diminishes the eventual importance of consistent thinking\r\nand plain speaking as essential parts of the work of political reform. A\r\nreforming movement, whose supporters never understand its own proper\r\nmeaning and purpose, is sure in the end to go astray. It is all very\r\nwell for Englishmen to do their thinking after the event, because\r\ntradition lies at the basis of their national life. But Americans, as a\r\nnation, are consecrated to the realization of a group of ideas; and\r\nideas to be fruitful must square both with the facts to which they are\r\napplied and with one another. Mr. Roosevelt and his hammer must be\r\naccepted gratefully, as the best available type of national reformer;\r\nbut the day may and should come when a national reformer will appear who\r\ncan be figured more in the guise of St. Michael, armed with a flaming\r\nsword and winged for flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION; ITS CONDITIONS AND PURPOSES\r\n\r\nThe best method of approaching a critical reconstruction of American\r\npolitical ideas will be by means of an analysis of the meaning of\r\ndemocracy. A clear popular understanding of the contents of the\r\ndemocratic principle is obviously of the utmost practical political\r\nimportance to the American people. Their loyalty to the idea of\r\ndemocracy, as they understand it, cannot be questioned. Nothing of any\r\nconsiderable political importance is done or left undone in the United\r\nStates, unless such action or inaction can be plausibly defended on\r\ndemocratic grounds; and the only way to secure for the American people\r\nthe benefit of a comprehensive and consistent political policy will be\r\nto derive it from a comprehensive and consistent conception of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nDemocracy as most frequently understood is essentially and exhaustively\r\ndefined as a matter of popular government; and such a definition raises\r\nat once a multitude of time-honored, but by no means superannuated,\r\ncontroversies. The constitutional liberals in England, in France, and in\r\nthis country have always objected to democracy as so understood, because\r\nof the possible sanction it affords for the substitution of a popular\r\ndespotism in the place of the former royal or oligarchic despotisms.\r\nFrom their point of view individual liberty is the greatest blessing\r\nwhich can be secured to a people by a government; and individual liberty\r\ncan be permanently guaranteed only in case political liberties are in\r\ntheory and practice subordinated to civil liberties. Popular political\r\ninstitutions constitute a good servant, but a bad master. When\r\nintroduced in moderation they keep the government of a country in close\r\nrelation with well-informed public opinion, which is a necessary\r\ncondition of political sanitation; but if carried too far, such\r\ninstitutions compromise the security of the individual and the integrity\r\nof the state. They erect a power in the state, which in theory is\r\nunlimited and which constantly tends in practice to dispense with\r\nrestrictions. A power which is theoretically absolute is under no\r\nobligation to respect the rights either of individuals or minorities;\r\nand sooner or later such power will be used for the purpose of opposing\r\nthe individual. The only way to secure individual liberty is,\r\nconsequently, to organize a state in which the Sovereign power is\r\ndeprived of any national excuse or legal opportunity of violating\r\ncertain essential individual rights.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing criticism of democracy, defined as popular government, may\r\nhave much practical importance; but there are objections to it on the\r\nscore of logic. It is not a criticism of a certain conception of\r\ndemocracy, so much as of democracy itself. Ultimate responsibility for\r\nthe government of a community must reside somewhere. If the single\r\nmonarch is practically dethroned, as he is by these liberal critics of\r\ndemocracy, some Sovereign power must be provided to take his place. In\r\nEngland Parliament, by means of a steady encroachment on the royal\r\nprerogatives, has gradually become Sovereign; but other countries, such\r\nas France and the United States, which have wholly dispensed with\r\nroyalty, cannot, even if they would, make a legislative body Sovereign\r\nby the simple process of allowing it to usurp power once enjoyed by the\r\nCrown. France did, indeed, after it had finally dispensed with\r\nLegitimacy, make two attempts to found governments in which the theory\r\nof popular Sovereignty was evaded. The Orleans monarchy, for instance,\r\nthrough the mouths of its friends, denied Sovereignty to the people,\r\nwithout being able to claim it for the King; and this insecurity of its\r\nlegal framework was an indirect cause of a violent explosion of\r\neffective popular Sovereignty in 1848. The apologists for the Second\r\nEmpire admitted the theory of a Sovereign people, but claimed that the\r\nSovereign power could be safely and efficiently used only in case it\r\nwere delegated to one Napoleon III--a view the correctness of which the\r\nresults of the Imperial policy eventually tended to damage. There is in\r\npoint of fact no logical escape from a theory of popular\r\nSovereignty--once the theory of divinely appointed royal Sovereignty is\r\nrejected. An escape can be made, of course, as in England, by means of a\r\ncompromise and a legal fiction; and such an escape can be fully\r\njustified from the English national point of view; but countries which\r\nhave rejected the royal and aristocratic tradition are forbidden this\r\nmeans of escape--if escape it is. They are obliged to admit the doctrine\r\nof popular Sovereignty. They are obliged to proclaim a theory of\r\nunlimited popular powers.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, a democracy may impose rules of action upon itself--as the\r\nAmerican democracy did in accepting the Federal Constitution. But in\r\nadopting the Federal Constitution the American people did not abandon\r\neither its responsibilities or rights as Sovereign. Difficult as it may\r\nbe to escape from the legal framework defined in the Constitution, that\r\nbody of law in theory remains merely an instrument which was made for\r\nthe people and which if necessary can and will be modified. A people, to\r\nwhom was denied the ultimate responsibility for its welfare, would not\r\nhave obtained the prime condition of genuine liberty. Individual freedom\r\nis important, but more important still is the freedom of a whole people\r\nto dispose of its own destiny; and I do not see how the existence of\r\nsuch an ultimate popular political freedom and responsibility can be\r\ndenied by any one who has rejected the theory of a divinely appointed\r\npolitical order. The fallibility of human nature being what it is, the\r\npractical application of this theory will have its grave dangers; but\r\nthese dangers are only evaded and postponed by a failure to place\r\nultimate political responsibility where it belongs. While a country in\r\nthe position of Germany or Great Britain may be fully justified from the\r\npoint of view of its national tradition, in merely compromising with\r\ndemocracy, other countries, such as the United States and France, which\r\nhave earned the right to dispense with these compromises, are at least\r\nbuilding their political structure on the real and righteous source of\r\npolitical authority. Democracy may mean something more than a\r\ntheoretically absolute popular government, but it assuredly cannot mean\r\nanything less.\r\n\r\nIf, however, democracy does not mean anything less than popular\r\nSovereignty, it assuredly does mean something more. It must at least\r\nmean an expression of the Sovereign will, which will not contradict and\r\ndestroy the continuous existence of its own Sovereign power. Several\r\ntimes during the political history of France in the nineteenth century,\r\nthe popular will has expressed itself in a manner adverse to popular\r\npolitical institutions. Assemblies have been elected by universal\r\nsuffrage, whose tendencies have been reactionary and undemocratic, and\r\nwho have been supported in this reactionary policy by an effective\r\npublic opinion. Or the French people have by means of a plebiscite\r\ndelegated their Sovereign power to an Imperial dictator, whose whole\r\npolitical system was based on a deep suspicion of the source of his own\r\nauthority. A particular group of political institutions or course of\r\npolitical action may, then, be representative of the popular will, and\r\nyet may be undemocratic. Popular Sovereignty is self-contradictory,\r\nunless it is expressed in a manner favorable to its own perpetuity and\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nThe assertion of the doctrine of popular Sovereignty is, consequently,\r\nrather the beginning than the end of democracy. There can be no\r\ndemocracy where the people do not rule; but government by the people is\r\nnot necessarily democratic. The popular will must in a democratic state\r\nbe expressed somehow in the interest of democracy itself; and we have\r\nnot traveled very far towards a satisfactory conception of democracy\r\nuntil this democratic purpose has received some definition. In what way\r\nmust a democratic state behave in order to contribute to its own\r\nintegrity?\r\n\r\nThe ordinary American answer to this question is contained in the\r\nassertion of Lincoln, that our government is \"dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal.\" Lincoln's phrasing of the\r\nprinciple was due to the fact that the obnoxious and undemocratic system\r\nof negro slavery was uppermost in his mind when he made his Gettysburg\r\naddress; but he meant by his assertion of the principle of equality\r\nsubstantially what is meant to-day by the principle of \"equal rights for\r\nall and special privileges for none.\" Government by the people has its\r\nnatural and logical complement in government for the people. Every state\r\nwith a legal framework must grant certain rights to individuals; and\r\nevery state, in so far as it is efficient, must guarantee to the\r\nindividual that his rights, as legally defined, are secure. But an\r\nessentially democratic state consists in the circumstance that all\r\ncitizens enjoy these rights equally. If any citizen or any group of\r\ncitizens enjoys by virtue of the law any advantage over their\r\nfellow-citizens, then the most sacred principle of democracy is\r\nviolated. On the other hand, a community in which no man or no group of\r\nmen are granted by law any advantage over their fellow-citizens is the\r\ntype of the perfect and fruitful democratic state. Society is organized\r\npolitically for the benefit of all the people. Such an organization may\r\npermit radical differences among individuals in the opportunities and\r\npossessions they actually enjoy; but no man would be able to impute his\r\nown success or failure to the legal framework of society. Every citizen\r\nwould be getting a \"Square Deal.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the idea of the democratic state, which the majority of good\r\nAmericans believe to be entirely satisfactory. It should endure\r\nindefinitely, because it seeks to satisfy every interest essential to\r\nassociated life. The interest of the individual is protected, because of\r\nthe liberties he securely enjoys. The general social interest is equally\r\nwell protected, because the liberties enjoyed by one or by a few are\r\nenjoyed by all. Thus the individual and the social interests are\r\nautomatically harmonized. The virile democrat in pursuing his own\r\ninterest \"under the law\" is contributing effectively to the interest of\r\nsociety, while the social interest consists precisely in the promotion\r\nof these individual interests, in so far as they can be equally\r\nexercised. The divergent demands of the individual and the social\r\ninterest can be reconciled by grafting the principle of equality on the\r\nthrifty tree of individual rights, and the ripe fruit thereof can be\r\ngathered merely by shaking the tree.\r\n\r\nIt must be immediately admitted, also, that the principle of equal\r\nrights, like the principle of ultimate popular political responsibility\r\nis the expression of an essential aspect of democracy. There is no room\r\nfor permanent legal privileges in a democratic state. Such privileges\r\nmay be and frequently are defended on many excellent grounds. They may\r\nunquestionably contribute for a time to social and economic efficiency\r\nand to individual independence. But whatever advantage may be derived\r\nfrom such permanent discriminations must be abandoned by a democracy. It\r\ncannot afford to give any one class of its citizens a permanent\r\nadvantage or to others a permanent grievance. It ceases to be a\r\ndemocracy, just as soon as any permanent privileges are conferred by its\r\ninstitutions or its laws; and this equality of right and absence of\r\npermanent privilege is the expression of a fundamental social interest.\r\n\r\nBut the principle of equal rights, like the principle of ultimate\r\npopular political responsibility, is not sufficient; and because of its\r\ninsufficiency results in certain dangerous ambiguities and\r\nself-contradictions. American political thinkers have always repudiated\r\nthe idea that by equality of rights they meant anything like equality of\r\nperformance or power. The utmost varieties of individual power and\r\nability are bound to exist and are bound to bring about many different\r\nlevels of individual achievement. Democracy both recognizes the right of\r\nthe individual to use his powers to the utmost, and encourages him to do\r\nso by offering a fair field and, in cases of success, an abundant\r\nreward. The democratic principle requires an equal start in the race,\r\nwhile expecting at the same time an unequal finish. But Americans who\r\ntalk in this way seem wholly blind to the fact that under a legal system\r\nwhich holds private property sacred there may be equal rights, but there\r\ncannot possibly be any equal opportunities for exercising such rights.\r\nThe chance which the individual has to compete with his fellows and take\r\na prize in the race is vitally affected by material conditions over\r\nwhich he has no control. It is as if the competitor in a Marathon cross\r\ncountry run were denied proper nourishment or proper training, and was\r\nobliged to toe the mark against rivals who had every benefit of food and\r\ndiscipline. Under such conditions he is not as badly off as if he were\r\nentirely excluded from the race. With the aid of exceptional strength\r\nand intelligence he may overcome the odds against him and win out. But\r\nit would be absurd to claim, because all the rivals toed the same mark,\r\nthat a man's victory or defeat depended exclusively on his own efforts.\r\nThose who have enjoyed the benefits of wealth and thorough education\r\nstart with an advantage which can be overcome only in very exceptional\r\nmen,--men so exceptional, in fact, that the average competitor without\r\nsuch benefits feels himself disqualified for the contest.\r\n\r\nBecause of the ambiguity indicated above, different people with\r\ndifferent interests, all of them good patriotic Americans, draw very\r\ndifferent inferences from the doctrine of equal rights. The man of\r\nconservative ideas and interests means by the rights, which are to be\r\nequally exercised, only those rights which are defined and protected by\r\nthe law--the more fundamental of which are the rights to personal\r\nfreedom and to private property. The man of radical ideas, on the other\r\nhand, observing, as he may very clearly, that these equal rights cannot\r\npossibly be made really equivalent to equal opportunities, bases upon\r\nthe same doctrine a more or less drastic criticism of the existing\r\neconomic and social order and sometimes of the motives of its\r\nbeneficiaries and conservators. The same principle, differently\r\ninterpreted, is the foundation of American political orthodoxy and\r\nAmerican political heterodoxy. The same measure of reforming\r\nlegislation, such as the new Inter-state Commerce Law, seems to one\r\nparty a wholly inadequate attempt to make the exercise of individual\r\nrights a little more equal, while it seems to others an egregious\r\nviolation of the principle itself. What with reforming legislation on\r\nthe one hand and the lack of it on the other, the once sweet air of the\r\nAmerican political mansion is soured by complaints. Privileges and\r\ndiscriminations seem to lurk in every political and economic corner. The\r\n\"people\" are appealing to the state to protect them against the\r\nusurpations of the corporations and the Bosses. The government is\r\nappealing to the courts to protect the shippers against the railroads.\r\nThe corporations are appealing to the Federal courts to protect them\r\nfrom the unfair treatment of state legislatures. Employers are fighting\r\ntrades-unionism, because it denies equal rights to their employers. The\r\nunionists are entreating public opinion to protect them against the\r\nunfairness of \"government by injunction.\" To the free trader the whole\r\nprotectionist system seems a flagrant discrimination on behalf of a\r\ncertain portion of the community. Everybody seems to be clamoring for a\r\n\"Square Deal\" but nobody seems to be getting it.\r\n\r\nThe ambiguity of the principle of equal rights and the resulting\r\nconfusion of counsel are so obvious that there must be some good reason\r\nfor their apparently unsuspected existence. The truth is that Americans\r\nhave not readjusted their political ideas to the teaching of their\r\npolitical and economic experience. For a couple of generations after\r\nJefferson had established the doctrine of equal rights as the\r\nfundamental principle of the American democracy, the ambiguity resident\r\nin the application of the doctrine was concealed. The Jacksonian\r\nDemocrats, for instance, who were constantly nosing the ground for a\r\nscent of unfair treatment, could discover no example of political\r\nprivileges, except the continued retention of their offices by\r\nexperienced public servants; and the only case of economic privilege of\r\nwhich they were certain was that of the National Bank. The fact is, of\r\ncourse, that the great majority of Americans were getting a \"Square\r\nDeal\" as long as the economic opportunities of a new country had not\r\nbeen developed and appropriated. Individual and social interest did\r\nsubstantially coincide as long as so many opportunities were open to the\r\npoor and untrained man, and as long as the public interest demanded\r\nfirst of all the utmost celerity of economic development. But, as we\r\nhave seen in a preceding chapter, the economic development of the\r\ncountry resulted inevitably in a condition which demanded on the part of\r\nthe successful competitor either increasing capital, improved training,\r\nor a larger amount of ability and energy. With the advent of comparative\r\neconomic and social maturity, the exercise of certain legal rights\r\nbecame substantially equivalent to the exercise of a privilege; and if\r\nequality of opportunity was to be maintained, it could not be done by\r\nvirtue of non-interference. The demands of the \"Higher Law\" began to\r\ndiverge from the results of the actual legal system.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is, of course, extremely loth to admit that there exists\r\nany such divergence of individual and social interest, or any such\r\ncontradiction in the fundamental American principle. Reformers no less\r\nthan conservatives have been doggedly determined to place some other\r\ninterpretation upon the generally recognized abuses; and the\r\ninterpretation on which they have fastened is that some of the victors\r\nhave captured too many prizes, because they did not play fair. There is\r\njust enough truth in this interpretation to make it plausible, although,\r\nas we have seen, the most flagrant examples of apparent cheating were\r\ndue as much to equivocal rules as to any fraudulent intention. But\r\northodox public opinion is obliged by the necessities of its own\r\nsituation to exaggerate the truth of its favorite interpretation; and\r\nany such exaggeration is attended with grave dangers, precisely because\r\nthe ambiguous nature of the principle itself gives a similar ambiguity\r\nto its violations. The cheating is understood as disobedience to the\r\nactual law, or as violation of a Higher Law, according to the interests\r\nand preconceptions of the different reformers; but however it is\r\nunderstood, they believe themselves to be upholding some kind of a Law,\r\nand hence endowed with some kind of a sacred mission.\r\n\r\nThus the want of integrity in what is supposed to be the formative\r\nprinciple of democracy results, as it did before the Civil War, in a\r\ndivision of the actual substance of the nation. Men naturally disposed\r\nto be indignant at people with whom they disagree come to believe that\r\ntheir indignation is comparable to that of the Lord. Men naturally\r\ndisposed to be envious and suspicious of others more fortunate than\r\nthemselves come to confuse their suspicions with a duty to the society.\r\nDemagogues can appeal to the passions aroused by this prevailing sense\r\nof unfair play for the purpose of getting themselves elected to office\r\nor for the purpose of passing blundering measures of repression. The\r\ntype of admirable and popular democrat ceases to be a statesman,\r\nattempting to bestow unity and health on the body politic by prescribing\r\nmore wholesome habits of living. He becomes instead a sublimated\r\nDistrict Attorney, whose duty it is to punish violations both of the\r\nactual and the \"Higher Law.\" Thus he is figured as a kind of an avenging\r\nangel; but (as it happens) he is an avenging angel who can find little\r\nto avenge and who has no power of flight. There is an enormous\r\ndiscrepancy between the promises of these gentlemen and their\r\nperformances, no matter whether they occupy an executive office, the\r\neditorial chairs of yellow journals, or merely the place of public\r\nprosecutor; and it sometimes happens that public prosecutors who have\r\nplayed the part of avenging angels before election, are, as Mr. William\r\nTravers Jerome knows, themselves prosecuted after a few years of office\r\nby their aggrieved constituents. The truth is that these gentlemen are\r\nconfronted by a task which is in a large measure impossible, and which,\r\nso far as possible, would be either disappointing or dangerous in its\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nHence it is that continued loyalty to a contradictory principle is\r\ndestructive of a wholesome public sentiment and opinion. A wholesome\r\npublic opinion in a democracy is one which keeps a democracy sound and\r\nwhole; and it cannot prevail unless the individuals composing it\r\nrecognize mutual ties and responsibilities which lie deeper than any\r\ndifferences of interest and idea. No formula whose effect on public\r\nopinion is not binding and healing and unifying has any substantial\r\nclaim to consideration as the essential and formative democratic idea.\r\nBelief in the principle of equal rights does not bind, heal, and unify\r\npublic opinion. Its effect rather is confusing, distracting, and at\r\nworst, disintegrating. A democratic political organization has no\r\nimmunity from grievances. They are a necessary result of a complicated\r\nand changing industrial and social organism. What is good for one\r\ngeneration will often be followed by consequences that spell deprivation\r\nfor the next. What is good for one man or one class of men will bring\r\nills to other men or classes of men. What is good for the community as a\r\nwhole may mean temporary loss and a sense of injustice to a minority.\r\nAll grievances from any cause should receive full expression in a\r\ndemocracy, but, inasmuch as the righteously discontented must be always\r\nwith us, the fundamental democratic principle should, above all, counsel\r\nmutual forbearance and loyalty. The principle of equal rights encourages\r\nmutual suspicion and disloyalty. It tends to attribute individual and\r\nsocial ills, for which general moral, economic, and social causes are\r\nusually in large measure responsible, to individual wrong-doing; and in\r\nthis way it arouses and intensifies that personal and class hatred,\r\nwhich never in any society lies far below the surface. Men who have\r\ngrievances are inflamed into anger and resentment. In claiming what they\r\nbelieve to be their rights, they are in their own opinion acting on\r\nbehalf not merely of their interests, but of an absolute democratic\r\nprinciple. Their angry resentment becomes transformed in their own minds\r\ninto righteous indignation; and there may be turned loose upon the\r\ncommunity a horde of self-seeking fanatics--like unto those soldiers in\r\nthe religious wars who robbed and slaughtered their opponents in the\r\nservice of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY AND DISCRIMINATION\r\n\r\nThe principle of equal rights has always appealed to its more patriotic\r\nand sensible adherents as essentially an impartial rule of political\r\naction--one that held a perfectly fair balance between the individual\r\nand society, and between different and hostile individual and class\r\ninterests. But as a fundamental principle of democratic policy it is as\r\nambiguous in this respect as it is in other respects. In its traditional\r\nform and expression it has concealed an extremely partial interest under\r\na formal proclamation of impartiality. The political thinker who\r\npopularized it in this country was not concerned fundamentally with\r\nharmonizing the essential interest of the individual with the essential\r\npopular or social interest. Jefferson's political system was intended\r\nfor the benefit only of a special class of individuals, viz., those\r\naverage people who would not be helped by any really formative rule or\r\nmethod of discrimination. In practice it has proved to be inimical to\r\nindividual liberty, efficiency, and distinction. An insistent demand for\r\nequality, even in the form of a demand for equal rights, inevitably has\r\na negative and limiting effect upon the free and able exercise of\r\nindividual opportunities. From the Jeffersonian point of view democracy\r\nwould incur a graver danger from a violation of equality than it would\r\nprofit from a triumphant assertion of individual liberty. Every\r\nopportunity for the edifying exercise of power, on the part either of an\r\nindividual, a group of individuals, or the state is by its very nature\r\nalso an opportunity for its evil exercise. The political leader whose\r\nofficial power depends upon popular confidence may betray the trust. The\r\ncorporation employing thousands of men and supplying millions of people\r\nwith some necessary service or commodity may reduce the cost of\r\nproduction only for its own profit. The state may use its great\r\nauthority chiefly for the benefit of special interests. The advocate of\r\nequal rights is preoccupied by these opportunities for the abusive\r\nexercise of power, because from his point of view rights exercised in\r\nthe interest of inequality have ceased to be righteous. He distrusts\r\nthose forms of individual and associated activity which give any\r\nindividual or association substantial advantages over their associates.\r\nHe becomes suspicious of any kind of individual and social distinction\r\nwith the nature and effects of which he is not completely familiar.\r\n\r\nA democracy of equal rights may tend to encourage certain expressions of\r\nindividual liberty; but they are few in number and limited in scope. It\r\nrejoices in the freedom of its citizens, provided this freedom receives\r\ncertain ordinary expressions. It will follow a political leader, like\r\nJefferson or Jackson, with a blind confidence of which a really free\r\ndemocracy would not be capable, because such leaders are, or claim to be\r\nin every respect, except their prominence, one of the \"people.\"\r\nDistinction of this kind does not separate a leader from the majority.\r\nIt only ties them together more firmly. It is an acceptable assertion of\r\nindividual liberty, because it is liberty converted by its exercise into\r\na kind of equality. In the same way the American democracy most\r\ncordially admired for a long time men, who pursued more energetically\r\nand successfully than their fellows, ordinary business occupations,\r\nbecause they believed that such familiar expressions of individual\r\nliberty really tended towards social and industrial homogeneity. Herein\r\nthey were mistaken; but the supposition was made in good faith, and it\r\nconstitutes the basis of the Jeffersonian Democrat's illusion in\r\nreference to his own interest in liberty. He dislikes or ignores\r\nliberty, only when it looks in the direction of moral and intellectual\r\nemancipation. In so far as his influence has prevailed, Americans have\r\nbeen encouraged to think those thoughts and to perform those acts which\r\neverybody else is thinking and performing.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a belief in the principle of \"equal rights\" on freedom is,\r\nhowever, most clearly shown by its attitude toward Democratic political\r\norganization and policy. A people jealous of their rights are not\r\nsufficiently afraid of special individual efficiency and distinction to\r\ntake very many precautions against it. They greet it oftener with\r\nneglect than with positive coercion. Jeffersonian Democracy is, however,\r\nvery much afraid of any examples of associated efficiency. Equality of\r\nrights is most in clanger of being violated when the exercise of rights\r\nis associated with power, and any unusual amount of power is usually\r\nderived from the association of a number of individuals for a common\r\npurpose. The most dangerous example of such association is not, however,\r\na huge corporation or a labor union; it is the state. The state cannot\r\nbe bound hand and foot by the law, as can a corporation, because it\r\nnecessarily possesses some powers of legislation; and the power to\r\nlegislate inevitably escapes the limitation of the principle of equal\r\nrights. The power to legislate implies the power to discriminate; and\r\nthe best way consequently for a good democracy of equal rights to avoid\r\nthe danger of discrimination will be to organize the state so that its\r\npower for ill will be rigidly restricted. The possible preferential\r\ninterference on the part of a strong and efficient government must be\r\nchecked by making the government feeble and devoid of independence. The\r\nless independent and efficient the several departments of the government\r\nare permitted to become, the less likely that the government as a whole\r\nwill use its power for anything but a really popular purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing type of political organization, which has been very\r\nmuch favored by the American democracy, the freedom of the official\r\npolitical leader is sacrificed for the benefit of the supposed freedom\r\nof that class of equalized individuals known as the \"people,\" but by the\r\n\"people\" Jefferson and his followers have never meant all the people or\r\nthe people as a whole. They have meant a sort of apotheosized\r\nmajority--the people in so far as they could be generalized and reduced\r\nto an average. The interests of this class were conceived as inimical to\r\nany discrimination which tended to select peculiarly efficient\r\nindividuals or those who were peculiarly capable of social service. The\r\nsystem of equal rights, particularly in its economic and political\r\napplication _has_ worked for the benefit of such a class, but rather in\r\nits effect upon American intelligence and morals, than in its effect\r\nupon American political and economic development. The system, that is,\r\nhas only partly served the purpose of its founder and his followers, and\r\nit has failed because it did not bring with it any machinery adequate\r\neven to its own insipid and barren purposes. Even the meager social\r\ninterest which Jefferson concealed under cover of his demand for equal\r\nrights could not be promoted without some effective organ of social\r\nresponsibility; and the Democrats of to-day are obliged, as we have\r\nseen, to invoke the action of the central government to destroy those\r\neconomic discriminations which its former inaction had encouraged. But\r\neven so the traditional democracy still retains its dislike of\r\ncentralized and socialized responsibility. It consents to use the\r\nmachinery of the government only for a negative or destructive object.\r\nSuch must always be the case as long as it remains true to its\r\nfundamental principle. That principle defines the social interest merely\r\nin the terms of an indiscriminate individualism--which is the one kind\r\nof individualism murderous to both the essential individual and the\r\nessential social interest.\r\n\r\nThe net result has been that wherever the attempt to discriminate in\r\nfavor of the average or indiscriminate individual has succeeded, it has\r\nsucceeded at the expense of individual liberty, efficiency, and\r\ndistinction; but it has more often failed than succeeded. Whenever the\r\nexceptional individual has been given any genuine liberty, he has\r\ninevitably conquered. That is the whole meaning of the process of\r\neconomic and social development traced in certain preceding chapters.\r\nThe strong and capable men not only conquer, but they seek to perpetuate\r\ntheir conquests by occupying all the strategic points in the economic\r\nand political battle-field--whereby they obtain certain more or less\r\npermanent advantages over their fellow-democrats. Thus in so far as the\r\nequal rights are freely exercised, they are bound to result in\r\ninequalities; and these inequalities are bound to make for their own\r\nperpetuation, and so to provoke still further discrimination. Wherever\r\nthe principle has been allowed to mean what it seems to mean, it has\r\ndetermined and encouraged its own violation. The marriage which it is\r\nsupposed to consecrate between liberty and equality gives birth to\r\nunnatural children, whose nature it is to devour one or the other of\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\nThe only way in which the thorough-going adherent of the principle of\r\nequal rights can treat these tendencies to discrimination, when they\r\ndevelop, is rigidly to repress them; and this tendency to repression is\r\nnow beginning to take possession of those Americans who represent the\r\npure Democratic tradition. They propose to crush out the chief examples\r\nof effective individual and associated action, which their system of\r\ndemocracy has encouraged to develop. They propose frankly to destroy, so\r\nfar as possible, the economic organization which has been built up under\r\nstress of competitive conditions; and by assuming such an attitude they\r\nhave fallen away even from the pretense of impartiality, and have come\r\nout as frankly representative of a class interest. But even to assert\r\nthis class interest efficiently they have been obliged to abandon, in\r\nfact if not in word, their correlative principle of national\r\nirresponsibility. Whatever the national interest may be, it is not to be\r\nasserted by the political practice of non-interference. The hope of\r\nautomatic democratic fulfillment must be abandoned. The national\r\ngovernment must stop in and discriminate; but it must discriminate, not\r\non behalf of liberty and the special individual, but on behalf of\r\nequality and the average man.\r\n\r\nThus the Jeffersonian principle of national irresponsibility can no\r\nlonger be maintained by those Democrats who sincerely believe that the\r\ninequalities of power generated in the American economic and political\r\nsystem are dangerous to the integrity of the democratic state. To this\r\nextent really sincere followers of Jefferson are obliged to admit the\r\nsuperior political wisdom of Hamilton's principle of national\r\nresponsibility, and once they have made this admission, they have\r\nimplicitly abandoned their contention that the doctrine of equal rights\r\nis a sufficient principle of democratic political action. They have\r\nimplicitly accepted the idea that the public interest is to be asserted,\r\nnot merely by equalizing individual rights, but by controlling\r\nindividuals in the exercise of those rights. The national public\r\ninterest has to be affirmed by positive and aggressive fiction. The\r\nnation has to have a will and a policy as well as the individual; and\r\nthis policy can no longer be confined to the merely negative task of\r\nkeeping individual rights from becoming in any way privileged.\r\n\r\nThe arduous and responsible political task which a nation in its\r\ncollective capacity must seek to perform is that of selecting among the\r\nvarious prevailing ways of exercising individual rights those which\r\ncontribute to national perpetuity and integrity. Such selection implies\r\nsome interference with the natural course of popular notion; and that\r\ninterference is always costly and may be harmful either to the\r\nindividual or the social interest must be frankly admitted. He would be\r\na foolish Hamiltonian who would claim that a state, no matter how\r\nefficiently organized and ably managed, will not make serious and\r\nperhaps enduring mistakes; but he can answer that inaction and\r\nirresponsibility are more costly and dangerous than intelligent and\r\nresponsible interference. The practice of non-interference is just as\r\nselective in its effects as the practice of state interference. It means\r\nmerely that the nation is willing to accept the results of natural\r\nselection instead of preferring to substitute the results of artificial\r\nselection. In one way or another a nation is bound to recognize the\r\nresults of selection. The Hamiltonian principle of national\r\nresponsibility recognizes the inevitability of selection; and since it\r\nis inevitable, is not afraid to interfere on behalf of the selection of\r\nthe really fittest. If a selective policy is pursued in good faith and\r\nwith sufficient intelligence, the nation will at least be learning from\r\nits mistakes. It should find out gradually the kind and method of\r\nselection, which is most desirable, and how far selection by\r\nnon-interference is to be preferred to active selection.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the American democracy both in its central and in\r\nits local governments has always practiced both methods of selection.\r\nThe state governments have sedulously indulged in a kind of interference\r\nconspicuous both for its activity and its inefficiency. The Federal\r\ngovernment, on the other hand, has been permitted to interfere very much\r\nless; but even during the palmiest days of national irresponsibility it\r\ndid not altogether escape active intervention. A protective tariff is,\r\nof course, a plain case of preferential class legislation, and so was\r\nthe original Inter-state Commerce Act. They were designed to substitute\r\nartificial preferences for those effected by unregulated individual\r\naction, on the ground that the proposed modification of the natural\r\ncourse of trade would contribute to the general economic prosperity. No\r\nless preferential in purpose are the measures of reform recently enacted\r\nby the central government. The amended Inter-state Commerce Law largely\r\nincreases the power of possible discrimination possessed by the Federal\r\nCommission. The Pure Food Bill forbids many practices, which have arisen\r\nin connection with the manufacture of food products, and discriminates\r\nagainst the perpetrators of such practices. Factory legislation or laws\r\nregulating the hours of labor have a similar meaning and justification.\r\nIt is not too much to say that substantially all the industrial\r\nlegislation, demanded by the \"people\" both here and abroad and passed in\r\nthe popular interest, has been based essentially on class\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nThe situation which these laws are supposed to meet is always the same.\r\nA certain number of individuals enjoy, in the beginning, equal\r\nopportunities to perform certain acts; and in the competition resulting\r\nthere from some of these individuals or associations obtain advantages\r\nover their competitors, or over their fellow-citizens whom they employ\r\nor serve. Sometimes these advantages and the practices whereby they are\r\nobtained are profitable to a larger number of people than they injure.\r\nSometimes the reverse is true. In either event the state is usually\r\nasked to interfere by the class whose economic position has been\r\ncompromised. It by no means follows that the state should acquiesce in\r\nthis demand. In many cases interference may be more costly than\r\nbeneficial. Each case must be considered on its merits. But whether in\r\nany particular case the state takes sides or remains impartial, it most\r\nassuredly has a positive function to perform on the promises. If it\r\nremains impartial, it simply agrees to abide by the results of natural\r\nselection. If it interferes, it seeks to replace natural with artificial\r\ndiscrimination. In both cases it authorizes discriminations which in\r\ntheir effect violate the doctrine of \"equal rights.\" Of course, a\r\nreformer can always claim that any particular measure of reform proposes\r\nmerely to restore to the people a \"Square Deal\"; but that is simply an\r\neasy and thoughtless way of concealing novel purposes under familiar\r\nformulas. Any genuine measure of economic or political reform will, of\r\ncourse, give certain individuals better opportunities than those they\r\nhave been recently enjoying, but it will reach this result only by\r\ndepriving other individuals of advantages which they have earned.\r\n\r\nImpartiality is the duty of the judge rather than the statesman, of the\r\ncourts rather than the government. The state which proposes to draw a\r\nring around the conflicting interests of its citizens and interfere only\r\non behalf of a fair fight will be obliged to interfere constantly and\r\nwill never accomplish its purpose. In economic warfare, the fighting can\r\nnever be fair for long, and it is the business of the state to see that\r\nits own friends are victorious. It holds, if you please, itself a hand\r\nin the game. The several players are playing, not merely with one\r\nanother, but with the political and social bank. The security and\r\nperpetuity of the state and of the individual in so far an he is a\r\nsocial animal, depend upon the victory of the national interest--as\r\nrepresented both in the assurance of the national profit and in the\r\ndomination of the nation's friends. It is in the position of the bank at\r\nMonte Carlo, which does not pretend to play fair, but which frankly\r\npromulgates rules advantageous to itself. Considering the percentage in\r\nits favor and the length of its purse, it cannot possibly lose. It is\r\nnot really gambling; and it does not propose to take any unnecessary\r\nrisks. Neither can a state, democratic or otherwise, which believes in\r\nits own purpose. While preserving at times an appearance of impartiality\r\nso that its citizens may enjoy for a while a sense of the reality of\r\ntheir private game, it must on the whole make the rules in its own\r\ninterest. It must help those men to win who are most capable of using\r\ntheir winnings for the benefit of society.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTIVE DISCRIMINATION\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that a democracy cannot avoid the constant assertion of\r\nnational responsibility for the national welfare, an all-important\r\nquestion remains as to the way in which and the purpose for which this\r\ninterference should be exercised. Should it be exercised on behalf of\r\nindividual liberty? Should it be exercised on behalf of social equality?\r\nIs there any way in which it can be exercised on behalf both of liberty\r\nand equality?\r\n\r\nHamilton and the constitutional liberals asserted that the state should\r\ninterfere exclusively on behalf of individual liberty; but Hamilton was\r\nno democrat and was not outlining the policy of a democratic state. In\r\npoint of fact democracies have never been satisfied with a definition of\r\ndemocratic policy in terms of liberty. Not only have the particular\r\nfriends of liberty usually been hostile to democracy, but democracies\r\nboth in idea and behavior have frequently been hostile to liberty; and\r\nthey have been justified in distrusting a political régime organized\r\nwholly or even chiefly for its benefit. \"La Liberté,\" says Mr. Emile\r\nFaguet, in the preface to his \"Politiques et Moralistes du Dix-Neuvième\r\nSiècle\"--\"La Liberté s'oppose à l'Égalité, car La Liberté est\r\naristocratique par essence. La Liberté ne se donne jamais, ne s'octroie\r\njamais; elle se conquiert. Or ne peuvent la conquérir que des groupes\r\nsociaux qui out su se donne la cohérence, l'organisation et la\r\ndiscipline et qui par conséquent, sont des groupes aristocratiques.\"\r\nThe fact that states organized exclusively or largely for the benefit\r\nof liberty are essentially aristocratic explains the hostile and\r\nsuspicious attitude of democracies towards such a principle of political\r\naction.\r\n\r\nOnly a comparatively small minority are capable at any one time of\r\nexercising political, economic, and civil liberties in an able,\r\nefficient, or thoroughly worthy manner; and a régime wrought for the\r\nbenefit of such a minority would become at best a state, in which\r\neconomic, political, and social power would be very unevenly\r\ndistributed--a state like the Orleans Monarchy in France of the\r\n\"Bourgeoisie\" and the \"Intellectuals.\" Such a state might well give its\r\ncitizens fairly good government, as did the Orleans Monarchy; but just\r\nin so far as the mass of the people had any will of its own, it could\r\nnot arouse vital popular interest and support; and it could not\r\ncontribute, except negatively, to the fund of popular good sense and\r\nexperience. The lack of such popular support caused the death of the\r\nFrench liberal monarchy; and no such régime can endure, save, as in\r\nEngland, by virtue of a somewhat abject popular acquiescence. As long as\r\nit does endure, moreover, it tends to undermine the virtue of its own\r\nbeneficiaries. The favored minority, feeling as they do tolerably sure\r\nof their position, can scarcely avoid a habit of making it somewhat too\r\neasy for one another. The political, economic, and intellectual leaders\r\nbegin to be selected without any sufficient test of their efficiency.\r\nSome sort of a test continues to be required; but the standards which\r\ndetermine it drift into a condition of being narrow, artificial, and\r\nlax. Political, intellectual, and social leadership, in order to\r\npreserve its vitality needs a feeling of effective responsibility to a\r\nbody of public opinion as wide, as varied, and as exacting as that of\r\nthe whole community.\r\n\r\nThe desirable democratic object, implied in the traditional democratic\r\ndemand for equality, consists precisely in that of bestowing a share of\r\nthe responsibility and the benefits, derived from political and economic\r\nassociation, upon the whole community. Democracies have assumed and have\r\nbeen right in assuming that a proper diffusion of effective\r\nresponsibility and substantial benefits is the one means whereby a\r\ncommunity can be supplied with an ultimate and sufficient bond of union.\r\nThe American democracy has attempted to manufacture a sufficient bond\r\nout of the equalization of rights: but such a bond is, as we have seen,\r\neither a rope of sand or a link of chains. A similar object must be\r\nachieved in some other way; and the ultimate success of democracy\r\ndepends upon its achievement.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental political and social problem of a democracy may be\r\nsummarized in the following terms. A democracy, like every political and\r\nsocial group, is composed of individuals, and must be organized for the\r\nbenefit of its constituent members. But the individual has no chance of\r\neffective personal power except by means of the secure exercise of\r\ncertain personal rights. Such rights, then, must be secured and\r\nexercised; yet when they are exercised, their tendency is to divide the\r\ncommunity into divergent classes. Even if enjoyed with some equality in\r\nthe beginning, they do not continue to be equally enjoyed, but make\r\ntowards discriminations advantageous to a minority. The state, as\r\nrepresenting the common interest, is obliged to admit the inevitability\r\nof such classifications and divisions, and has itself no alternative but\r\nto exercise a decisive preference on behalf of one side or the other. A\r\nwell-governed state will use its power to promote edifying and desirable\r\ndiscriminations. But if discriminations tend to divide the community,\r\nand the state itself cannot do more than select among the various\r\npossible cases of discrimination those which it has some reason to\r\nprefer, how is the solidarity of the community to be preserved? And\r\nabove all, how is a democratic community, which necessarily includes\r\neverybody in its benefits and responsibilities, to be kept well united?\r\nSuch a community must retain an ultimate bond of union which counteracts\r\nthe divergent effect of the discriminations, yet which at the same time\r\nis not fundamentally hostile to individual liberties.\r\n\r\nThe clew to the best available solution of the problem is supplied by a\r\nconsideration of the precise manner, in which the advantages derived\r\nfrom the efficient exercise of liberties become inimical to a wholesome\r\nsocial condition. The hostility depends, not upon the existence of such\r\nadvantageous discriminations for a time, but upon their persistence for\r\ntoo long a time. When, either from natural or artificial causes, they\r\nare properly selected, they contribute at the time of their selection\r\nboth to individual and to social efficiency. They have been earned, and\r\nit is both just and edifying that, in so far as they have been earned,\r\nthey should be freely enjoyed. On the other hand, they should not, so\r\nfar as possible, be allowed to outlast their own utility. They must\r\ncontinue to be earned. It is power and opportunity enjoyed without being\r\nearned which help to damage the individual--both the individuals who\r\nbenefit and the individuals who consent--and which tend to loosen the\r\nultimate social bond. A democracy, no less than a monarchy or an\r\naristocracy, must recognize political, economic, and social\r\ndiscriminations, but it must also manage to withdraw its consent\r\nwhenever these discriminations show any tendency to excessive endurance.\r\nThe essential wholeness of the community depends absolutely on the\r\nceaseless creation of a political, economic, and social aristocracy and\r\ntheir equally incessant replacement.\r\n\r\nBoth in its organization and in its policy a democratic state has\r\nconsequently to seek two different but supplementary objects. It is the\r\nfunction of such a state to represent the whole community; and the whole\r\ncommunity includes the individual as well as the mass, the many as well\r\nas the few. The individual is merged in the mass, unless he is enabled\r\nto exercise efficiently and independently his own private and special\r\npurposes. He must not only be permitted, he must be encouraged to earn\r\ndistinction; and the best way in which he can be encouraged to earn\r\ndistinction is to reward distinction both by abundant opportunity and\r\ncordial appreciation. Individual distinction, resulting from the\r\nefficient performance of special work, is not only the foundation of all\r\ngenuine individuality, but is usually of the utmost social value. In so\r\nfar as it is efficient, it has a tendency to be constructive. It both\r\ninserts some member into the social edifice which forms for the time\r\nbeing a desirable part of the whole structure, but it tends to establish\r\na standard of achievement which may well form a permanent contribution\r\nto social amelioration. It is useful to the whole community, not because\r\nit is derived from popular sources or conforms to popular standards, but\r\nbecause it is formative and so helps to convert the community into a\r\nwell-formed whole.\r\n\r\nDistinction, however, even when it is earned, always has a tendency to\r\nremain satisfied with its achievements, and to seek indefinitely its own\r\nperpetuation. When such a course is pursued by an efficient and\r\ndistinguished individual, he is, of course, faithless to the meaning and\r\nthe source of his own individual power. In abandoning and replacing him\r\na democracy is not recreant to the principle of individual liberty. It\r\nis merely subjecting individual liberty to conditions which promote and\r\ndetermine its continued efficiency. Such conditions never have been and\r\nnever will be imposed for long by individuals or classes of individuals\r\nupon themselves. They must be imposed by the community, and nothing less\r\nthan the whole community. The efficient exercise of individual power is\r\nnecessary to form a community and make it whole, but the duty of keeping\r\nit whole rests with the community itself. It must consciously and\r\nresolutely preserve the social benefit, derived from the achievements of\r\nits favorite sons; and the most effective means thereto is that of\r\ndenying to favoritism of all kinds the opportunity of becoming a mere\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nThe specific means whereby this necessary and formative favoritism can\r\nbe prevented from becoming a mere habit vary radically among the\r\ndifferent fields of personal activity. In the field of intellectual work\r\nthe conditions imposed upon the individual must for the most part be the\r\ncreation of public opinion; and in its proper place this aspect of the\r\nrelation between individuality and democracy will receive special\r\nconsideration. In the present connection, however, the relation of\r\nindividual liberty to democratic organization and policy can be\r\nillustrated and explained most helpfully by a consideration of the\r\nbinding and formative conditions of political and economic liberty.\r\nDemocracies have always been chiefly preoccupied with the problems\r\nraised by the exercise of political and economic opportunities, because\r\nsuccess in politics and business implies the control of a great deal of\r\nphysical power and the consequent possession by the victors in a\r\npeculiar degree of both the motive and the means to perpetuate their\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe particular friends of freedom, such as Hamilton and the French\r\n\"doctrinaires,\" have always believed that both civil and political\r\nliberty depended on the denial of popular Sovereignty and the rigid\r\nlimitation of the suffrage. Of course, a democrat cannot accept such a\r\nconclusion. He should doubtless admit that the possession of absolute\r\nSovereign power is always liable to abuse; and if he is candid, he can\r\nhardly fail to add that democratic favoritism is subject to the same\r\nweakness as aristocratic or royal favoritism. It tends, that is, to make\r\nindividuals seek distinction not by high individual efficiency, but by\r\ncompromises in the interest of useful popularity. It would be vain to\r\ndeny the gravity of this danger or the extent to which, in the best of\r\ndemocracies, the seekers after all kinds of distinction have been\r\nhypnotized by an express desire for popularity. But American statesmen\r\nhave not always been obliged to choose between Hamilton's unpopular\r\nintegrity and Henry Clay's unprincipled bidding for popular favor. The\r\ngreatest American political leaders have been popular without any\r\npersonal capitulation; and their success is indicative of what is\r\ntheoretically the most wholesome relation between individual political\r\nliberty and a democratic distribution of effective political power. The\r\nhighest and most profitable individual political distinction is that\r\nwhich is won from a large field and from a whole people. Political, even\r\nmore than other kinds of distinction, should not be the fruit of a\r\nlimited area of selection. It must be open to everybody, and it must be\r\nacceptable to the community as a whole. In fact, the concession of\r\nsubstantially equal political rights is an absolute condition of any\r\nfundamental political bond. Grave as are the dangers which a democratic\r\npolitical system incurs, still graver ones are incurred by a rigidly\r\nlimited electoral organization. A community, so organized, betrays a\r\nfundamental lack of confidence in the mutual loyalty and good faith of\r\nits members, and such a community can remain well united only at the\r\ncost of a mixture of patronage and servility.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of the suffrage to those who are individually capable of\r\nmaking the best use of it has the appearance of being reasonable; and it\r\nhas made a strong appeal to those statesmen and thinkers who believed in\r\nthe political leadership of intelligent and educated men. Neither can it\r\nbe denied that a rigidly restricted suffrage might well make in the\r\nbeginning for administrative efficiency and good government. But it must\r\nnever be forgotten that a limited suffrage confines ultimate political\r\nresponsibility, not only to a number of peculiarly competent\r\nindividuals, but to a larger or smaller class; and in the long run a\r\nclass is never to be trusted to govern in the interest of the whole\r\ncommunity. A democracy should encourage the political leadership of\r\nexperienced, educated, and well-trained men, but only on the express\r\ncondition that their power is delegated and is to be used, under severe\r\npenalties, for the benefit of the people as a whole. A limited suffrage\r\nsecures governmental efficiency, if at all, at the expense of the\r\npolitical education and training of the disfranchised class, and at the\r\nexpense, also, of a permanent and radical popular political grievance. A\r\nsubstantially universal suffrage merely places the ultimate political\r\nresponsibility in the hands of those for whose benefit governments are\r\ncreated; and its denial can be justified only on the ground that the\r\nwhole community is incapable of exercising the responsibility. Such\r\ncases unquestionably exist. They exist wherever the individuals\r\nconstituting a community, as at present in the South, are more divided\r\nby social or class ambitions and prejudices than they are united by a\r\ntradition of common action and mutual loyalty. But wherever the whole\r\npeople are capable of thinking, feeling, and acting as if they\r\nconstituted a whole, universal suffrage, even if it costs something in\r\ntemporary efficiency, has a tendency to be more salutary and more\r\nformative than a restricted suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe substantially equal political rights enjoyed by the American people\r\nfor so many generations have not proved dangerous to the civil liberties\r\nof the individual and, except to a limited extent, not to his political\r\nliberty. Of course, the American democracy has been absolutely opposed\r\nto the delegation to individuals of official political power, except\r\nunder rigid conditions both as to scope and duration; and the particular\r\nfriends of liberty have always claimed that such rigid conditions\r\ndestroyed individual political independence and freedom. Hamilton, for\r\ninstance, was insistent upon the necessity of an upper house consisting\r\nof life-members who would not be dependent on popular favor for their\r\nretention of office. But such proposals have no chance of prevailing in\r\na sensible democracy. A democracy is justified in refusing to bestow\r\npermanent political power upon individuals, because such permanent\r\ntenure of office relaxes oftener than it stimulates the efficiency of\r\nthe favored individual, and makes him attach excessive importance to\r\nmere independence. The official leaders of a democracy should, indeed,\r\nhold their offices under conditions which will enable them to act and\r\nthink independently; but independence is really valuable only when the\r\nofficeholder has won it from his own followers. Under any other\r\nconditions it is not only peculiarly liable to abuse, but it deprives\r\nthe whole people of that ultimate responsibility for their own welfare,\r\nwithout which democracy is meaningless. A democracy is or should be\r\nconstantly delegating an effective share in this responsibility to its\r\nofficial leaders, but only on condition that the power and\r\nresponsibility delegated is partial and is periodically resumed.\r\n\r\nThe only Americans who hold important official positions for life are\r\nthe judges of the Federal courts. Radical democrats have always\r\nprotested against this exception, which, nevertheless, can be permitted\r\nwithout any infringement of democratic principles. The peculiar position\r\nof the Federal judge is symptomatic of the peculiar importance in the\r\nAmerican system of the Federal Constitution. A senator would be less\r\nlikely to be an efficient and public-spirited legislator, in case he\r\nwere not obliged at regular intervals to prove title to his distinction.\r\nA justice of the Supreme Court, on the other hand, can the better\r\nperform his special task, provided he has a firm and permanent hold upon\r\nhis office. He cannot, to be sure, entirely escape responsibility to\r\npublic opinion, but his primary duty is to expound the Constitution as\r\nhe understands it; and it is a duty which demands the utmost personal\r\nindependence. The fault with the American system in this respect\r\nconsists not in the independence of the Federal judiciary, but in the\r\npractical immutability of the Constitution. If the instrument which the\r\nSupreme Court expounds could be altered whenever a sufficiently large\r\nbody of public opinion has demanded a change for a sufficiently long\r\ntime, the American democracy would have much more to gain than to fear\r\nfrom the independence of the Federal judiciary.\r\n\r\nThe interest of individual liberty in relation to the organization of\r\ndemocracy demands simply that the individual officeholder should possess\r\nan amount of power and independence adequate to the efficient\r\nperformance of his work. The work of a justice of the Supreme Court\r\ndemands a power that is absolute for its own special work, and it\r\ndemands technically complete independence. An executive should, as a\r\nrule, serve for a longer term, and hold a position of greater\r\nindependence than a legislator, because his work of enforcing the laws\r\nand attending to the business details of government demands continuity,\r\ncomplete responsibility within its own sphere, and the necessity\r\noccasionally of braving adverse currents of public opinion. The term of\r\nservice and the technical independence of a legislator might well be\r\nmore restricted than that of an executive; but even a legislator should\r\nbe granted as much power and independence as he may need for the\r\nofficial performance of his public duty. The American democracy has\r\nshown its enmity to individual political liberty, not because it has\r\nrequired its political favorites constantly to seek reëlection, but\r\nbecause it has since 1800 tended to refuse to its favorites during their\r\nofficial term as much power and independence as is needed for\r\nadministrative, legislative, and judicial efficiency. It has been\r\njealous of the power it delegated, and has tried to take away with one\r\nhand what it gave with the other.\r\n\r\nTaking American political traditions, ideals, institutions, and\r\npractices as a whole, there is no reason to believe that the American\r\ndemocracy cannot and will not combine sufficient opportunities for\r\nindividual political distinction with an effective ultimate popular\r\npolitical responsibility. The manner in which the combination has been\r\nmade hitherto is far from flawless, and the American democracy has much\r\nto learn before it reaches an organization adequate to its own proper\r\npurposes. It must learn, above all, that the state, and the individuals\r\nwho are temporarily responsible for the action of the state, must be\r\ngranted all the power necessary to redeem that responsibility.\r\nIndividual opportunity and social welfare both depend upon the learning\r\nof this lesson; and while it is still very far from being learned, the\r\nobstacles in the way are not of a disheartening nature.\r\n\r\nWith the economic liberty of the individual the case is different. The\r\nFederalists refrained from protecting individual political rights by\r\nincorporating in the Constitution any limitation of the suffrage; but\r\nthey sought to protect the property rights of the individual by the most\r\nabsolute constitutional guarantees. Moreover, American practice has\r\nallowed the individual a far larger measure of economic liberty than is\r\nrequired by the Constitution; and this liberty was granted in the\r\nexpectation that it would benefit, not the individual as such, but the\r\ngreat mass of the American people. It has undoubtedly benefited the\r\ngreat mass of the American people; but it has been of far more benefit\r\nto a comparatively few individuals. Americans are just beginning to\r\nlearn that the great freedom which the individual property-owner has\r\nenjoyed is having the inevitable result of all unrestrained exercise of\r\nfreedom. It has tended to create a powerful but limited class whose\r\nchief object it is to hold and to increase the power which they have\r\ngained; and this unexpected result has presented the American democracy\r\nwith the most difficult and radical of its problems. Is it to the\r\ninterest of the American people as a democracy to permit the increase or\r\nthe perpetuation of the power gained by this aristocracy of money?\r\n\r\nA candid consideration of the foregoing question will, I believe, result\r\nin a negative answer. A democracy has as much interest in regulating for\r\nits own benefit the distribution of economic power as it has the\r\ndistribution of political power, and the consequences of ignoring this\r\ninterest would be as fatal in one case as in the other. In both\r\ninstances regulation in the democratic interest is as far as possible\r\nfrom meaning the annihilation of individual liberty; but in both\r\ninstances individual liberty should be subjected to conditions which\r\nwill continue to keep it efficient and generally serviceable. Individual\r\neconomic power is not any more dangerous than individual political\r\npower--provided it is not held too absolutely and for too long a time.\r\nBut in both cases the interest of the community as a whole should be\r\ndominant; and the interest of the whole community demands a considerable\r\nconcentration of economic power and responsibility, but only for the\r\nultimate purpose of its more efficient exercise and the better\r\ndistribution of its fruits.\r\n\r\nThat certain existing American fortunes have in their making been of the\r\nutmost benefit to the whole economic organism is to my mind\r\nunquestionably the fact. Men like Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, Mr. Andrew\r\nCarnegie, Mr. James J. Hill, and Mr. Edward Harriman have in the course\r\nof their business careers contributed enormously to American economic\r\nefficiency. They have been overpaid for their services, but that is\r\nirrelevant to the question immediately under consideration. It is\r\nsufficient that their economic power has been just as much earned by\r\nsubstantial service as was the political power of a man like Andrew\r\nJackson; and if our country is to continue its prosperous economic\r\ncareer, it must retain an economic organization which will offer to men\r\nof this stamp the opportunity and the inducement to earn distinction.\r\nThe rule which has already been applied to the case of political power\r\napplies, also, to economic power. Individuals should enjoy as much\r\nfreedom from restraint, as much opportunity, and as much responsibility\r\nas is necessary for the efficient performance of their work. Opinions\r\nwill differ as to the extent of this desirable independence and its\r\nassociated responsibility. The American millionaire and his supporters\r\nclaim, of course, that any diminution of opportunity and independence\r\nwould be fatal. To dispute this inference, however, does not involve the\r\nabandonment of the rule itself. A democratic economic system, even more\r\nthan a democratic political system, must delegate a large share of\r\nresponsibility and power to the individual, but under conditions, if\r\npossible, which will really make for individual efficiency and\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nThe grievance which a democrat may feel towards the existing economic\r\nsystem is that it makes only partially for genuine individual economic\r\nefficiency and distinction. The political power enjoyed by an individual\r\nAmerican rarely endures long enough to survive its own utility. But\r\neconomic power can in some measure at least be detached from its\r\ncreator. Let it be admitted that the man who accumulates $50,000,000 in\r\npart earns it, but how about the man who inherits it? The inheritor of\r\nsuch a fortune, like the inheritor of a ducal title, has an opportunity\r\nthrust upon him. He succeeds to a colossal economic privilege which he\r\nhas not earned and for which he may be wholly incompetent. He rarely\r\ninherits with the money the individual ability possessed by its maker,\r\nbut he does inherit a \"money power\" wholly independent of his own\r\nqualifications or deserts. By virtue of that power alone he is in a\r\nposition in some measure to exploit his fellow-countrymen. Even though a\r\nman of very inferior intellectual and moral caliber, he is able vastly\r\nto increase his fortune through the information and opportunity which\r\nthat fortune bestows upon him, and without making any individual\r\ncontribution to the economic organization of the country. His power\r\nbrings with it no personal dignity or efficiency; and for the whole\r\nmaterial and meaning of his life he becomes as much dependent upon his\r\nmillions as a nobleman upon his title. The money which was a source of\r\ndistinction to its creator becomes in the course of time a source of\r\nindividual demoralization to its inheritor. His life is organized for\r\nthe purpose of spending a larger income than any private individual can\r\nreally need; and his intellectual point of view is bounded by his narrow\r\nexperience and his class interests.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the institution of private property, necessitating, as it does,\r\nthe transmission to one person of the possessions and earnings of\r\nanother, always involves the inheritance of unearned power and\r\nopportunity. But the point is that in the case of very large fortunes\r\nthe inherited power goes far beyond any legitimate individual needs, and\r\nin the course of time can hardly fail to corrupt its possessors. The\r\ncreator of a large fortune may well be its master; but its inheritor\r\nwill, except in the case of exceptionally able individuals, become its\r\nvictim, and most assuredly the evil social effects are as bad as the\r\nevil individual effects. The political bond which a democracy seeks to\r\ncreate depends for its higher value upon an effective social bond. Gross\r\ninequalities in wealth, wholly divorced from economic efficiency on the\r\npart of the rich, as effectively loosen the social bond as do gross\r\ninequalities of political and social standing. A wholesome social\r\ncondition in a democracy does not imply uniformity of wealth any more\r\nthan it implies uniformity of ability and purpose, but it does imply the\r\nassociation of great individual economic distinction with responsibility\r\nand efficiency. It does imply that economic leaders, no less than\r\npolitical ones, should have conditions imposed upon them which will\r\nforce them to recognize the responsibilities attached to so much power.\r\nMutual association and confidence between the leaders and followers is\r\nas much a part of democratic economic organization as it is of\r\ndemocratic political organization; and in the long run the inheritance\r\nof vast fortunes destroys any such relation. They breed class envy on\r\none side, and class contempt on the other; and the community is either\r\ndivided irremediably by differences of interest and outlook, or united,\r\nif at all, by snobbish servility.\r\n\r\nIf the integrity of a democracy is injured by the perpetuation of\r\nunearned economic distinctions, it is also injured by extreme poverty,\r\nwhether deserved or not. A democracy which attempted to equalize wealth\r\nwould incur the same disastrous fate as a democracy which attempted to\r\nequalize political power; but a democracy can no more be indifferent to\r\nthe distribution of wealth than it can to the distribution of the\r\nsuffrage. In a wholesome democracy every male adult should participate\r\nin the ultimate political responsibility, partly because of the\r\npolitical danger of refusing participation to the people, and partly\r\nbecause of the advantages to be derived from the political union of the\r\nwhole people. So a wholesome democracy should seek to guarantee to every\r\nmale adult a certain minimum of economic power and responsibility. No\r\ndoubt it is much easier to confer the suffrage on the people than it is\r\nto make poverty a negligible social factor; but the difficulty of the\r\ntask does not make it the less necessary. It stands to reason that in\r\nthe long run the people who possess the political power will want a\r\nsubstantial share of the economic fruits. A prudent democracy should\r\nanticipate this demand. Not only does any considerable amount of\r\ngrinding poverty constitute a grave social danger in a democratic state,\r\nbut so, in general, does a widespread condition of partial economic\r\nprivation. The individuals constituting a democracy lack the first\r\nessential of individual freedom when they cannot escape from a condition\r\nof economic dependence.\r\n\r\nThe American democracy has confidently believed in the fatal prosperity\r\nenjoyed by the people under the American system. In the confidence of\r\nthat belief it has promised to Americans a substantial satisfaction of\r\ntheir economic needs; and it has made that promise an essential part of\r\nthe American national idea. The promise has been measurably fulfilled\r\nhitherto, because the prodigious natural resources of a new continent\r\nwere thrown open to anybody with the energy to appropriate them. But\r\nthose natural resources have now in large measure passed into the\r\npossession of individuals, and American statesmen can no longer count\r\nupon them to satisfy the popular hunger for economic independence. An\r\never larger proportion of the total population of the country is taking\r\nto industrial occupations, and an industrial system brings with it much\r\nmore definite social and economic classes, and a diminution of the\r\nearlier social homogeneity. The contemporary wage-earner is no longer\r\nsatisfied with the economic results of being merely an American citizen.\r\nHis union is usually of more obvious use to him than the state, and he\r\nis tending to make his allegiance to his union paramount to his\r\nallegiance to the state. This is only one of many illustrations that the\r\ntraditional American system has broken down. The American state can\r\nregain the loyal adhesion of the economically less independent class\r\nonly by positive service. What the wage-earner needs, and what it is to\r\nthe interest of a democratic state he should obtain, is a constantly\r\nhigher standard of living. The state can help him to conquer a higher\r\nstandard of living without doing any necessary injury to his employers\r\nand with a positive benefit to general economic and social efficiency.\r\nIf it is to earn the loyalty of the wage-earners, it must recognize the\r\nlegitimacy of his demand, and make the satisfaction of it an essential\r\npart of its public policy.\r\n\r\nThe American state is dedicated to such a duty, not only by its\r\ndemocratic purpose, but by its national tradition. So far as the former\r\nis concerned, it is absurd and fatal to ask a popular majority to\r\nrespect the rights of a minority, when those rights are interpreted so\r\nas seriously to hamper, if not to forbid, the majority from obtaining\r\nthe essential condition of individual freedom and development--viz. the\r\nhighest possible standard of living. But this absurdity becomes really\r\ncritical and dangerous, in view of the fact that the American people,\r\nparticularly those of alien birth and descent, have been explicitly\r\npromised economic freedom and prosperity. The promise was made on the\r\nstrength of what was believed to be an inexhaustible store of natural\r\nopportunities; and it will have to be kept even when those natural\r\nresources are no longer to be had for the asking. It is entirely\r\npossible, of course, that the promise can never be kept,--that its\r\nredemption will prove to be beyond the patience, the power, and the\r\nwisdom of the American people and their leaders; but if it is not kept,\r\nthe American commonwealth will no longer continue to be a democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE BRIDGE BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND NATIONALITY\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared, I hope, to venture upon a more fruitful definition\r\nof democracy. The popular definitions err in describing it in terms of\r\nits machinery or of some partial political or economic object. Democracy\r\ndoes not mean merely government by the people, or majority rule, or\r\nuniversal suffrage. All of these political forms or devices are a part\r\nof its necessary organization; but the chief advantage such methods of\r\norganization have is their tendency to promote some salutary and\r\nformative purpose. The really formative purpose is not exclusively a\r\nmatter of individual liberty, although it must give individual liberty\r\nabundant scope. Neither is it a matter of equal rights alone, although\r\nit must always cherish the social bond which that principle represents.\r\nThe salutary and formative democratic purpose consists in using the\r\ndemocratic organization for the joint benefit of individual distinction\r\nand social improvement.\r\n\r\nTo define the really democratic organization as one which makes\r\nexpressly and intentionally for individual distinction and social\r\nimprovement is nothing more than a translation of the statement that\r\nsuch an organization should make expressly and intentionally for the\r\nwelfare of the whole people. The whole people will always consist of\r\nindividuals, constituting small classes, who demand special\r\nopportunities, and the mass of the population who demand for their\r\nimprovement more generalized opportunities. At any particular time or in\r\nany particular case, the improvement of the smaller classes may conflict\r\nwith that of the larger class, but the conflict becomes permanent and\r\nirreconcilable only when it is intensified by the lack of a really\r\nbinding and edifying public policy, and by the consequent stimulation of\r\nclass and factional prejudices and purposes. A policy, intelligently\r\ninformed by the desire to maintain a joint process of individual and\r\nsocial amelioration, should be able to keep a democracy sound and whole\r\nboth in sentiment and in idea. Such a democracy would not be dedicated\r\neither to liberty or to equality in their abstract expressions, but to\r\nliberty and equality, in so far as they made for human brotherhood. As\r\nM. Faguet says in the introduction to his \"Politiques et Moralistes du\r\nDix-Neuvième Siècle,\" from which I have already quoted: \"Liberté et\r\nÉgalité sont donc contradictoires et exclusives l'une et l'autre; mais\r\nla Fraternité les concilierait. La Fraternité non seulement concilierait\r\nla Liberté et l'Égalité, mais elle les ferait gêneratrices l'une et\r\nl'autre.\" The two subordinate principles, that is, one representing the\r\nindividual and the other the social interest, can by their subordination\r\nto the principle of human brotherhood, be made in the long run mutually\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing definition of the democratic purpose is the only one which\r\ncan entitle democracy to an essential superiority to other forms of\r\npolitical organization. Democrats have always tended to claim some such\r\nsuperiority for their methods and purposes, but in case democracy is to\r\nbe considered merely as a piece of political machinery, or a partial\r\npolitical idea, the claim has no validity. Its superiority must be based\r\nupon the fact that democracy is the best possible translation into\r\npolitical and social terms of an authoritative and comprehensive moral\r\nidea; and provided a democratic state honestly seeks to make its\r\norganization and policy contribute to a better quality of individuality\r\nand a higher level of associated life, it can within certain limits\r\nclaim the allegiance of mankind on rational moral grounds.\r\n\r\nThe proposed definition may seem to be both vague and commonplace; but\r\nit none the less brings with it practical consequences of paramount\r\nimportance. The subordination of the machinery of democracy to its\r\npurpose and the comprehension within that purpose of the higher\r\ninterests both of the individual and society, is not only exclusive of\r\nmany partial and erroneous ideas, but demands both a reconstructive\r\nprogramme and an efficient organization. A government by the people,\r\nwhich seeks an organization and a policy beneficial to the individual\r\nand to society, is confronted by a task as responsible and difficult as\r\nyou please; but it is a specific task which demands the adoption of\r\ncertain specific and positive means. Moreover it is a task which the\r\nAmerican democracy has never sought consciously to achieve. American\r\ndemocrats have always hoped for individual and social amelioration as\r\nthe result of the operation of their democratic system; but if any such\r\nresult was to follow, its achievement was to be a happy accident. The\r\norganization and policy of a democracy should leave the individual and\r\nsociety to seek their own amelioration. The democratic state should\r\nnever discriminate in favor of anything or anybody. It should only\r\ndiscriminate against all sorts of privilege. Under the proposed\r\ndefinition, on the other hand, popular government is to make itself\r\nexpressly and permanently responsible for the amelioration of the\r\nindividual and society; and a necessary consequence of this\r\nresponsibility is an adequate organization and a reconstructive policy.\r\n\r\nThe majority of good Americans will doubtless consider that the\r\nreconstructive policy, already indicated, is flagrantly socialistic both\r\nin its methods and its objects; and if any critic likes to fasten the\r\nstigma of socialism upon the foregoing conception of democracy, I am not\r\nconcerned with dodging the odium of the word. The proposed definition of\r\ndemocracy is socialistic, if it is socialistic to consider democracy\r\ninseparable from a candid, patient, and courageous attempt to advance\r\nthe social problem towards a satisfactory solution. It is also\r\nsocialistic in case socialism cannot be divorced from the use, wherever\r\nnecessary, of the political organization in all its forms to realize the\r\nproposed democratic purpose. On the other hand, there are some doctrines\r\nfrequently associated with socialism, to which the proposed conception\r\nof democracy is wholly inimical; and it should be characterized not so\r\nmuch socialistic, as unscrupulously and loyally nationalistic.\r\n\r\nA democracy dedicated to individual and social betterment is necessarily\r\nindividualist as well as socialist. It has little interest in the mere\r\nmultiplication of average individuals, except in so far as such\r\nmultiplication is necessary to economic and political efficiency; but it\r\nhas the deepest interest in the development of a higher quality of\r\nindividual self-expression. There are two indispensable economic\r\nconditions of qualitative individual self-expression. One is the\r\npreservation of the institution of private property in some form, and\r\nthe other is the radical transformation of its existing nature and\r\ninfluence. A democracy certainly cannot fulfill its mission without the\r\neventual assumption by the state of many functions now performed by\r\nindividuals, and without becoming expressly responsible for an improved\r\ndistribution of wealth; but if any attempt is made to accomplish these\r\nresults by violent means, it will most assuredly prove to be a failure.\r\nAn improvement in the distribution of wealth or in economic efficiency\r\nwhich cannot be accomplished by purchase on the part of the state or by\r\na legitimate use of the power of taxation, must be left to the action of\r\ntime, assisted, of course, by such arrangements as are immediately\r\npractical. But the amount of actual good to the individual and society\r\nwhich can be effected _at any one time_ by an alteration in the\r\ndistribution of wealth is extremely small; and the same statement is\r\ntrue of any proposed state action in the interest of the democratic\r\npurpose. Consequently, while responsible state action is an essential\r\ncondition of any steady approach to the democratic consummation, such\r\naction will be wholly vain unless accompanied by a larger measure of\r\nspontaneous individual amelioration. In fact, one of the strongest\r\narguments on behalf of a higher and larger conception of state\r\nresponsibilities in a democracy is that the candid, courageous, patient,\r\nand intelligent attempt to redeem those responsibilities provides one of\r\nthe highest types of individuality--viz. the public-spirited man with a\r\npersonal opportunity and a task which should be enormously stimulating\r\nand edifying.\r\n\r\nThe great weakness of the most popular form of socialism consists,\r\nhowever, in its mixture of a revolutionary purpose with an international\r\nscope. It seeks the abolition of national distinctions by revolutionary\r\nrevolts of the wage-earner against the capitalist; and in so far as it\r\nproposes to undermine the principle of national cohesion and to\r\nsubstitute for it an international organization of a single class, it is\r\nheaded absolutely in the wrong direction. Revolutions may at times be\r\nnecessary and on the whole helpful, but not in case there is any other\r\npracticable method of removing grave obstacles to human amelioration;\r\nand in any event their tendency is socially disintegrating. The\r\ndestruction or the weakening of nationalities for the ostensible benefit\r\nof an international socialism would in truth gravely imperil the bond\r\nupon which actual human association is based. The peoples who have\r\ninherited any share in Christian civilization are effectively united\r\nchiefly by national habits, traditions, and purposes; and perhaps the\r\nmost effective way of bringing about an irretrievable division of\r\npurpose among them would be the adoption by the class of wage-earners\r\nof the programme of international socialism. It is not too much to say\r\nthat no permanent good can, under existing conditions, come to the\r\nindividual and society except through the preservation and the\r\ndevelopment of the existing system of nationalized states.\r\n\r\nRadical and enthusiastic democrats have usually failed to attach\r\nsufficient importance to the ties whereby civilized men are at the\r\npresent time actually united. Inasmuch as national traditions are\r\nusually associated with all sorts of political, economic, and social\r\nprivileges and abuses, they have sought to identify the higher social\r\nrelation with the destruction of the national tradition and the\r\nsubstitution of an ideal bond. In so doing they are committing a\r\ndisastrous error; and democracy will never become really constructive\r\nuntil this error is recognized and democracy abandons its former\r\nalliance with revolution. The higher human relation must be brought\r\nabout chiefly by the improvement and the intensification of existing\r\nhuman relations. The only possible foundation for a better social\r\nstructure is the existing order, of which the contemporary system of\r\nnationalized states forms the foundation.\r\n\r\nLoyalty to the existing system of nationalized states does not\r\nnecessarily mean loyalty to an existing government merely because it\r\nexists. There have been, and still are, governments whose ruin is a\r\nnecessary condition of popular liberation; and revolution doubtless\r\nstill has a subordinate part to play in the process of human\r\namelioration. The loyalty which a citizen owes to a government is\r\ndependent upon the extent to which the government is representative of\r\nnational traditions and is organized in the interest of valid national\r\npurposes. National traditions and purposes always contain a large\r\ninfusion of dubious ingredients; but loyalty to them does not\r\nnecessarily mean the uncritical and unprotesting acceptance of the\r\nnational limitations and abuses. Nationality is a political and social\r\nideal as well as the great contemporary political fact. Loyalty to the\r\nnational interest implies devotion to a progressive principle. It\r\ndemands, to be sure, that the progressive principle be realized without\r\nany violation of fundamental national ties. It demands that any national\r\naction taken for the benefit of the progressive principle be approved\r\nby the official national organization. But it also serves as a ferment\r\nquite as much as a bond. It bids the loyal national servants to fashion\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen into more of a nation; and the attempt to\r\nperform this bidding constitutes a very powerful and wholesome source of\r\npolitical development. It constitutes, indeed, a source of political\r\ndevelopment which is of decisive importance for a satisfactory theory of\r\npolitical and social progress, because a people which becomes more of a\r\nnation has a tendency to become for that very reason more of a\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that a people which becomes more of a nation becomes for\r\nthat very reason more of a democracy, is, I am aware, a hazardous\r\nassertion, which can be justified, if at all, only at a considerable\r\nexpense. As a matter of fact, the two following chapters will be devoted\r\nchiefly to this labor of justification. In the first of these chapters I\r\nshall give a partly historical and partly critical account of the\r\nnational principle in its relation to democracy; and in the second I\r\nshall apply the results, so achieved, to the American national principle\r\nin its relation to the American democratic idea. But before starting\r\nthis complicated task, a few words must be premised as to the reasons\r\nwhich make the attempt well worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nIf a people, in becoming more of a nation, become for that very reason\r\nmore of a democracy, the realization of the democratic purpose is not\r\nrendered any easier, but democracy is provided with a simplified, a\r\nconsistent, and a practicable programme. An alliance is established\r\nthereby between the two dominant political and social forces in modern\r\nlife. The suspicion with which aggressive advocates of the national\r\nprinciple have sometimes regarded democracy would be shown to have only\r\na conditional justification; and the suspicion with which many ardent\r\ndemocrats have regarded aggressive nationalism would be similarly\r\ndisarmed. A democrat, so far as the statement is true, could trust the\r\nfate of his cause in each particular state to the friends of national\r\nprogress. Democracy would not need for its consummation the ruin of the\r\ntraditional political fabrics; but so far as those political bodies were\r\ninformed by genuinely national ideas and aspirations, it could await\r\nconfidently the process of national development. In fact, the first duty\r\nof a good democrat would be that of rendering to his country loyal\r\npatriotic service. Democrats would abandon the task of making over the\r\nworld to suit their own purposes, until they had come to a better\r\nunderstanding with their own countrymen. One's democracy, that is, would\r\nbegin at home and it would for the most part stay at home; and the cause\r\nof national well-being would derive invaluable assistance from the loyal\r\ncoöperation of good democrats.\r\n\r\nA great many obvious objections will, of course, be immediately raised\r\nagainst any such explanation of the relation between democracy and\r\nnationality; and I am well aware that these objections demand the most\r\nserious consideration. A generation or two ago the European democrat was\r\noften by way of being an ardent nationalist; and a constructive relation\r\nbetween the two principles was accepted by many European political\r\nreformers. The events of the last fifty years have, however, done much\r\nto sever the alliance, and to make European patriots suspicious of\r\ndemocracy, and European democrats suspicious of patriotism. To what\r\nextent these suspicions are justified, I shall discuss in the next\r\nchapter; but that discussion will be undertaken almost exclusively for\r\nobtaining, if possible, some light upon our domestic situation. The\r\nformula of a constructive relation between the national and democratic\r\nprinciples has certain importance for European peoples, and particularly\r\nfor Frenchmen: but, if true, it is of a far superior importance to\r\nAmericans. It supplies a constructive form for the progressive solution\r\nof their political and social problems; and while it imposes on them\r\nresponsibilities which they have sought to evade, it also offers\r\ncompensations, the advantage of which they have scarcely expected.\r\n\r\nAmericans have always been both patriotic and democratic, just as they\r\nhave always been friendly both to liberty and equality, but in neither\r\ncase have they brought the two ideas or aspirations into mutually\r\nhelpful relations. As democrats they have often regarded nationalism\r\nwith distrust, and have consequently deprived their patriotism of any\r\nsufficient substance and organization. As nationalists they have\r\nfrequently regarded essential aspects of democracy with a wholly\r\nunnecessary and embarrassing suspicion. They have been after a fashion\r\nHamiltonian, and Jeffersonian after more of a fashion; but they have\r\nnever recovered from the initial disagreement between Hamilton and\r\nJefferson. If there is any truth in the idea of a constructive relation\r\nbetween democracy and nationality this disagreement must be healed. They\r\nmust accept both principles loyally and unreservedly; and by such\r\nacceptance their \"noble national theory\" will obtain a wholly\r\nunaccustomed energy and integrity. The alliance between the two\r\nprinciples will not leave either of them intact; but it will necessarily\r\ndo more harm to the Jeffersonian group of political ideas than it will\r\nto the Hamiltonian. The latter's nationalism can be adapted to democracy\r\nwithout an essential injury to itself, but the former's democracy cannot\r\nbe nationalized without being transformed. The manner of its\r\ntransformation has already been discussed in detail. It must cease to be\r\na democracy of indiscriminate individualism; and become one of selected\r\nindividuals who are obliged constantly to justify their selection; and\r\nits members must be united not by a sense of joint irresponsibility, but\r\nby a sense of joint responsibility for the success of their political\r\nand social ideal. They must become, that is, a democracy devoted to the\r\nwelfare of the whole people by means of a conscious labor of individual\r\nand social improvement; and that is precisely the sort of democracy\r\nwhich demands for its realization the aid of the Hamiltonian\r\nnationalistic organization and principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nNATIONALITY AND DEMOCRACY; NATIONAL ORIGINS\r\n\r\nWhatever the contemporary or the logical relation between nationality\r\nand democracy as ideas and as political forces, they were in their\r\norigin wholly independent one of the other. The Greek city states\r\nsupplied the first examples of democracy; but their democracy brought\r\nwith it no specifically national characteristics. In fact, the political\r\ncondition and ideal implied by the word nation did not exist in the\r\nancient world. The actual historical process, which culminated in the\r\nformation of the modern national state, began some time in the Middle\r\nAges--a period in which democracy was almost an incredible form of\r\npolitical association. Some of the mediæval communes were not without\r\ntraces of democracy; but modern nations do not derive from those\r\nturbulent little states. They derive from the larger political divisions\r\ninto which Europe drifted during the Dark Ages; and they have grown with\r\nthe gradually prospering attempt to bestow on the government of these\r\nEuropean countries the qualities of efficiency and responsibility.\r\n\r\nA complete justification of the foregoing statements would require a\r\ncritical account of the political development of Western Europe since\r\n400 B.C.; but within the necessary limits of the present discussion, we\r\nshall have to be satisfied with the barest summary of the way in which\r\nthe modern national states originated, and of the relation to democracy\r\nwhich has gradually resulted from their own proper development. A great\r\ndeal of misunderstanding exists as to the fundamental nature of a\r\nnational as compared to a city or to an imperial state, because the\r\nmeaning of the national idea has been obscured by the controversies\r\nwhich its militant assertion has involved. It has been identified both\r\nwith a revolutionary and a racial political principle, whereas its\r\nrevolutionary or racial associations are essentially occasional and\r\naccidental. The modern national state is at bottom the most intelligent\r\nand successful attempt which has yet been made to create a comparatively\r\nstable, efficient, and responsible type of political association.\r\n\r\nThe primary objects sought in political association are internal order,\r\nsecurity from foreign attack, the authoritative and just adjustment of\r\ndomestic differences and grievances, and a certain opportunity for\r\nindividual development; and these several objects are really reducible\r\nto two, because internal order cannot be preserved among a vigorous\r\npeople, in case no sufficient opportunity is provided for individual\r\ndevelopment or for the adjustment of differences and grievances. In\r\norder that a state may be relatively secure from foreign attack, it must\r\npossess a certain considerable area, population, and military\r\nefficiency. The fundamental weakness of the commune or city state has\r\nalways been its inability to protect itself from the aggressions of\r\nlarger or more warlike neighbors, and its correlative inability to\r\nsettle its own domestic differences without foreign interference. On the\r\nother hand, when a state became sufficiently large and well organized to\r\nfeel safe against alien aggression, it inevitably became the aggressor\r\nitself; and it inevitably carried the conquest of its neighbors just as\r\nfar as it was able. But domestic security, which is reached by constant\r\nforeign aggression, results inevitably in a huge unwieldy form of\r\nimperial political organization which is obliged by the logic of its\r\nsituation to seek universal dominion. The Romans made the great attempt\r\nto establish a dominion of this kind; and while their Empire could not\r\nendure, because their military organization destroyed in the end the\r\nvery foundation of internal order, they bequeathed to civilization a\r\npolitical ideal and a legal code of inestimable subsequent value.\r\n\r\nAs long as men were obliged to choose between a communal or an imperial\r\ntype of political organization,--which was equivalent merely to a choice\r\nbetween anarchy and despotism,--the problem of combining internal order\r\nwith external security seemed insoluble. They needed a form of\r\nassociation strong enough to defend their frontiers, but not\r\nsufficiently strong to attack their neighbors with any chance of\r\ncontinued success; and such a state could not exist unless its unity\r\nand integrity had some moral basis, and unless the aggressions of\r\nexceptionally efficient states were checked by some effective\r\ninter-state organization. The coexistence of such states demanded in its\r\nturn the general acceptance of certain common moral ties and standards\r\namong a group of neighboring peoples; and such a tie was furnished by\r\nthe religious bond with which Catholic Christianity united the peoples\r\nof Western Europe--a bond whereby the disorder and anarchy of the early\r\nMiddle Ages was converted into a vehicle of political and social\r\neducation. The members of the Christian body had much to fear from their\r\nfellow-Christians, but they also had much to gain. They shared many\r\ninteresting and vital subjects of consultation; and even when they\r\nfought, as they usually did, they were likely to fight to some purpose.\r\nBut beyond their quarrels Catholic Christians comprised one universe of\r\ndiscourse. They were somehow responsible one to another; and their\r\nmutual ties and responsibilities were most clearly demonstrated whenever\r\na peculiarly unscrupulous and insistent attempt was made to violate\r\nthem. As new and comparatively strong states began to emerge from the\r\nconfusion of the early Middle Ages, it was soon found that under the new\r\nconditions states which were vigorous enough to establish internal peace\r\nand to protect their frontiers were not vigorous enough to conquer their\r\nneighbors. Political efficiency was brought to a much better realization\r\nof its necessary limits and responsibilities, because of the moral and\r\nintellectual education which the adoption of Christianity had imposed\r\nupon the Western peoples.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest examples of political efficiency in mediæval Europe\r\nwas the England of Edward I, which had begun to exhibit certain\r\ncharacteristics of a national state. Order was more than usually well\r\npreserved. It was sheltered by the Channel from foreign attack. The\r\ninterest both of the nobles and of the people had been considered in its\r\npolitical organization. A fair balance was maintained among the leading\r\nmembers of the political body, so that the English kings could invade\r\nFrance with united national armies which easily defeated the incoherent\r\nrabble of knights and serfs whereby they were opposed. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen the English, after the manner of other efficient states, tried to\r\nconquer France, they were wholly unable to extinguish French\r\nresistance, as the similar resistance of conquered peoples had so\r\nfrequently been extinguished in classic times. The French people rallied\r\nto a king who united them in their resistance to foreign domination; and\r\nthe ultimate effect of the prolonged English aggression was merely the\r\nincreasing national efficiency and the improving political organization\r\nof the French people.\r\n\r\nThe English could not extinguish the resistance of the French people,\r\nbecause their aggression aroused in Frenchmen latent power of effective\r\nassociation. Notwithstanding the prevalence of a factious minority, and\r\nthe lack of any habit or tradition of national association, the power of\r\nunited action for a common purpose was stimulated by the threat of alien\r\ndomination; and this latent power was unquestionably the result in some\r\nmeasure of the discipline of Christian ideas to which the French, in\r\ncommon with the other European peoples, had been subjected. That\r\ndiscipline had, as has already been observed, increased men's capacity\r\nfor fruitful association one with another. It had stimulated a social\r\nrelationship much superior to the prevailing political relationship. It\r\nhad enabled them to believe in an idea and to fight devotedly on its\r\nbehalf. It is no accident, consequently, that the national resistance\r\ntook on a religious character, and in Jeanne d'Arc gave birth to one of\r\nthe most fragrant figures in human history. Thus the French national\r\nresistance, and the national bond thereby created, was one political\r\nexpression of the power of coöperation developed in the people of Europe\r\nby the acceptance of a common religious bond. On the other hand, the use\r\nwhich the English had made of their precocious national organization\r\nweakened its foundations. The aggressive exercise of military force\r\nabroad for an object which it was incompetent to achieve disturbed the\r\ndomestic balance of power on which the national organization of the\r\nEnglish people rested. English political efficiency was dependent partly\r\nupon its responsible exercise; and it could not survive the disregard of\r\ndomestic responsibilities entailed by the expense in men and money of\r\nfutile external aggression.\r\n\r\nThe history of Europe as it emerged from the Middle Ages affords a\r\ncontinuous illustration of the truth that the increasing political\r\nefficiency of the several states was proportioned to the exercise of\r\ntheir powers in a responsible manner. The national development of the\r\nseveral states was complicated in the beginning by the religious wars;\r\nbut those peoples suffered least from the wars of religion who did not\r\nin the end allow them to interfere with their primary political\r\nresponsibilities. Spain, for instance, whose centuries of fighting with\r\nthe Moors had enormously developed her military efficiency, used this\r\nmilitary power solely for the purpose of pursuing political and\r\nreligious objects antagonistic or irrelevant to the responsibilities of\r\nthe Spanish kings towards their own subjects. The Spanish monarchy\r\nproclaimed as its dominant political object the maintenance by force of\r\nthe Catholic faith throughout Europe; and for three generations it\r\nwasted the superb military strength and the economic resources of the\r\nSpanish people in an attempt to crush out Protestantism in Holland and\r\nEngland and to reinforce militant Catholicism in France. Upon Germany,\r\ndivided into a number of petty states, partly Protestant, and partly\r\nCatholic, but with the Imperial power exerted on behalf of a Catholic\r\nand anti-national interest, the religious wars laid a heavy hand. Her\r\nlack of political cohesion made her the prey of neighboring countries\r\nwhose population was numerically smaller, but which were better\r\norganized; and the end of the Thirty Years' War left her both despoiled\r\nand exhausted, because her political organization was wholly incapable\r\nof realizing a national policy or of meeting the national needs. Great\r\nBritain during all this period was occupied with her domestic problems\r\nand interfered comparatively little in continental affairs; and the\r\nresult of this discreet and sensible effort to adapt her national\r\norganization to her peculiar domestic needs was in the eighteenth\r\ncentury an extraordinary increase of national efficiency. France also\r\nemerged from the religious wars headed by a dynasty which really\r\nrepresented national aspirations, and which was alive in some respects\r\nto its responsibilities toward the French people. The Bourbon monarchy\r\nconsolidated the French national organization, encouraged French\r\nintellectual and religious life, and at times sought in an intelligent\r\nmanner to improve the economic conditions of the country. For the first\r\ntime in the history of continental Europe something resembling a\r\ngenuinely national state was developed. Differences of religious opinion\r\nhad been subordinated to the political and social interests of the\r\nFrench people. The crown, with the aid of a succession of able\r\nministers, suppressed a factious nobility at home, and gradually made\r\nFrance the dominant European Power. A condition of the attainment of\r\nboth of these objects was the loyal support of the French people, and\r\nthe alliance with the monarchy, as the embodiment of French national\r\nlife, of Frenchmen of ability and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe French monarchy, however, after it had become the dominant power in\r\nEurope, followed the bad example of previous states, and aroused the\r\nfear of its neighbors by a policy of excessive aggression. In this\r\ninstance French domineering did not stimulate the national development\r\nof any one neighbor, because it was not concentrated upon any one or two\r\npeoples. But it did threaten the common interests of a number of\r\nEuropean states; and it awakened an unprecedented faculty of inter-state\r\nassociation for the protection of these interests. The doctrine of the\r\nBalance of Power waxed as the result of this experience into a living\r\nprinciple in European politics; and it imposed an effective check upon\r\nthe aggression of any single state. France was unable to retain the\r\npreponderant position which she had earned during the early years of the\r\nreign of Louis XIV; and this mistake of the Bourbon monarchy was the\r\ncause of its eventual downfall. The finances of the country were wrecked\r\nby its military efforts and failures, the industrial development of the\r\npeople checked, and their loyalty to the Bourbons undermined. A gulf was\r\ngradually created between the French nation and its official\r\norganization and policy.\r\n\r\nEngland, on the other hand, was successfully pursuing the opposite work\r\nof national improvement and consolidation. She was developing a system\r\nof government which, while preserving the crown as the symbol of social\r\norder, combined aristocratic leadership with some measure of national\r\nrepresentation. For the first time in centuries the different members of\r\nher political body again began to function harmoniously; and she used\r\nthe increasing power of aggression thereby secured with unprecedented\r\ndiscretion and good sense. She had learned that her military power could\r\nnot be used with any effect across the Channel, and that under existing\r\nconditions her national interests in relation to the other European\r\nPowers were more negative than positive. Her expansive energy was\r\nconcentrated on the task of building up a colonial empire in Asia and\r\nAmerica; and in this task her comparative freedom from continental\r\nentanglements enabled her completely to vanquish France. Her success in\r\ncreating a colonial empire anticipated with extraordinary precision the\r\ncourse during the nineteenth century of European national development.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the political situation of Europe towards the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century the student of the origin of the power and\r\nprinciple of nationality will be impressed by its two divergent aspects.\r\nThe governments of the several European states had become tolerably\r\nefficient for those purposes in relation to which, during the sixteenth\r\ncentury and before, efficiency had been most necessary. They could keep\r\norder. Their citizens were protected to some extent in the enjoyment of\r\ntheir legal rights. The several governments were closely associated\r\nchiefly for the purpose of preventing excessive aggression on the part\r\nof any one state and of preserving the Balance of Power. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, these governments had acquired during the turbulent era an\r\nunlimited authority which was indispensable to the fundamental task of\r\nmaintaining order, but which, after order had been secured, was\r\nsufficient to encourage abuse. Their power was in theory absolute. It\r\nwas an imitation of Roman Imperialism, and made no allowance for those\r\nlimitations, both in its domestic and foreign expressions, which existed\r\nas a consequence of national growth and the international system. Their\r\nauthority at all times was keyed up to the pitch of a great emergency.\r\nIt was supposed to be the immediate expression of the common weal. The\r\ncommon weal was identified with the security of society and the state.\r\nThe security of the state dictated the supreme law. The very authority,\r\nconsequently, which was created to preserve order and the Balance of\r\nPower gradually became an effective cause of internal and external\r\ndisorder. It became a source not of security, but of individual and\r\nsocial insecurity, because a properly organized machinery for exercising\r\nsuch a power and redeeming such a vast responsibility had not as yet\r\nbeen wrought.\r\n\r\nThe rulers of the continental states in the eighteenth century explained\r\nand excused every important action they took by what was called \"La\r\nRaison d'État\"--that is, by reasons connected with the public safety\r\nwhich justified absolute authority and extreme measures. But as a matter\r\nof fact this absolute authority, instead of being confined in its\r\nexercise to matters in which the public safety was really concerned, was\r\nwasted and compromised chiefly for the benefit of a trivial domestic\r\npolicy and a merely dynastic foreign policy. At home the exercise of\r\nabsolute authority was not limited to matters and occasions which really\r\nraised questions of public safety. In their foreign policies the\r\nmajority of the states had little idea of the necessary and desirable\r\nlimits of their own aggressive power. Those limits were imposed from\r\nwithout; and when several states could combine in support of an act of\r\ninternational piracy, as in the case of the partition of Poland, Europe\r\ncould not be said to have any effective system of public law. The\r\npartition of Poland, which France could and should have prevented, was\r\nat once a convincing exposure of the miserable international position to\r\nwhich France had been reduced by the Bourbons, and the best possible\r\ntestimony to the final moral bankruptcy of the political system of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE IMPLICATIONS OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nIn 1789 the bombshell of the French Revolution exploded under this\r\nfabric of semi-national and semi-despotic, but wholly royalist and\r\naristocratic, European political system. For the first time in the\r\nhistory of European nations a national organization and tradition was\r\nconfronted by a radical democratic purpose and faith. The two ideas have\r\nbeen face to face ever since; and European history thereafter may, in\r\nits broadest aspect, be considered as an attempt to establish a fruitful\r\nrelation between them. In the beginning it looked as if democracy would,\r\nso far as it prevailed, be wholly destructive of national institutions\r\nand the existing international organization. The insurgent democrats\r\nsought to ignore and to eradicate the very substance of French national\r\nachievement. They began by abolishing all social and economic privileges\r\nand by framing a new polity based in general upon the English idea of a\r\nlimited monarchy, partial popular representation, and equal civil\r\nrights; but, carried along by the momentum of their ideas and incensed\r\nby the disloyalty of the king and his advisers and the threat of\r\ninvasion they ended by abolishing royalty, establishing universal\r\nsuffrage and declaring war upon every embodiment, whether at home or\r\nabroad, of the older order. The revolutionary French democracy\r\nproclaimed a creed, not merely subversive of all monarchical and\r\naristocratic institutions, but inimical to the substance and the spirit\r\nof nationality. Indeed it did not perceive any essential distinction\r\nbetween the monarchical or legitimist and the national principles; and\r\nthe error was under the circumstances not unnatural. In the European\r\npolitical landscape of 1793 despotic royalty was a much more conspicuous\r\nfact than the centuries of political association in which these\r\nmonarchies had been developed. But the eyes of the French democrats had\r\nbeen partially blinded by their own political interests and theories.\r\nTheir democracy was in theory chiefly a matter of abstract political\r\nrights which remitted logically in a sort of revolutionary anarchy. The\r\nactual bonds whereby men were united were ignored. All traditional\r\nauthority fell under suspicion. Frenchmen, in their devotion to their\r\nideas and in their distrust of every institution, idea, or person\r\nassociated with the Old Régime, hacked at the roots of their national\r\ncohesion and undermined the foundations of social order.\r\n\r\nTo a disinterested political philosopher of that day the antagonism\r\nbetween the principle of political authority and cohesion, as\r\nrepresented by the legitimate monarchies, and the principle of popular\r\nSovereignty represented by the French democracy, may well have looked\r\nirretrievable. But events soon proved that such an inference could not\r\nbe drawn too quickly. It is true that the French democracy, by breaking\r\nso violently the bonds of national association, perpetuated a division\r\nbetween their political organization and the substance of their national\r\nlife, which was bound in the end to constitute a source of weakness. Yet\r\nthe revolutionary democracy succeeded, nevertheless, in releasing\r\nsources of national energy, whose existence had never before been\r\nsuspected, and in uniting the great body of the French people for the\r\nperformance of a great task. Even though French national cohesion had\r\nbeen injured in one respect, French national efficiency was temporarily\r\nso increased that the existing organization and power of the other\r\ncontinental countries proved inadequate to resist it. When the French\r\ndemocracy was attacked by its monarchical neighbors, the newly aroused\r\nnational energy of the French people was placed enthusiastically at the\r\nservice of the military authorities. The success of the French armies,\r\neven during the disorders of the Convention and the corruption of the\r\nDirectory, indicated that revolutionary France possessed possibilities\r\nof national efficiency far superior to the France of the Old Régime.\r\n\r\nNeither the democrats nor Napoleon had, in truth, broken as much as they\r\nthemselves and their enemies believed with the French national\r\ntradition; but unfortunately that aspect of the national tradition\r\nperpetuated by them was by no means its best aspect. The policy, the\r\nmethods of administration, and the actual power of the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety and of Napoleon were all inherited from the Old Régime.\r\nRevolutionary France merely adapted to new conditions the political\r\norganization and policy to which Frenchmen had been accustomed; and the\r\nmost serious indictment to be made against it is that its excesses\r\nprevented it from dispensing with the absolutism which social disorder\r\nand unwarranted foreign aggression always necessitate. The Revolution\r\nmade France more of a nation than it had been in the eighteenth century,\r\nbecause it gave to the French people the civil freedom, the political\r\nexperience, and the economic opportunities which they needed, but it did\r\nnot heal the breach which the Bourbons had made between the political\r\norganization of France and its legitimate national interests and\r\naspirations. France in 1815, like France in 1789, remained a nation\r\ndivided against itself,--a nation which had perpetuated during a\r\ndemocratic revolution a part of its national tradition most opposed to\r\nthe logic of its new political and social ideas. It remained, that is, a\r\nnation whose political organization and policy had not been adapted to\r\nits domestic needs, and one which occupied on anomalous and suspected\r\nposition in the European international system.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, French democracy and Imperialism had directly and\r\nindirectly instigated the greater national efficiency of the neighboring\r\nEuropean states. Alliances among European monarchs had not been\r\nsufficient to check the Imperial ambitions of Napoleon, as they had\r\nbeen sufficient to check the career of Louis XIV, because behind a\r\ngreater general was the loyal devotion and the liberated energy of the\r\nFrench people; but when outrages perpetrated on the national feelings of\r\nGermans and Spaniards added an enthusiastic popular support to the\r\nhatred which the European monarchs cherished towards a domineering\r\nupstart, the fall of Napoleon became only a question of time. The excess\r\nand the abuse of French national efficiency and energy, consequent upon\r\nits sudden liberation and its perpetuation of an illogical but natural\r\npolicy of national aggression, had the same effect upon Europe as\r\nEnglish aggression had upon the national development of France. Napoleon\r\nwas crushed under a popular uprising, comparable to that of the French\r\npeople, which had been the condition of his own aggrandizement. Thus, in\r\nspite of the partial antagonism between the ideas of the French\r\nRevolutionary democracy and the principle of nationality the ultimate\r\neffect of the Revolution both in France and in Europe was to increase\r\nthe force and to enlarge the area of the national movement. English\r\nnational sentiment was enormously stimulated by the strenuous wars of\r\nthe Revolutionary epoch. The embers of Spanish national feeling were\r\nblown into spasmodic life. The peoples of Italy and Germany had been\r\npossessed by the momentum of a common political purpose, and had been\r\nstirred by promises of national representation. Even France, unstable\r\nthough its political condition was, had lost none of the results of the\r\nRevolution for which it had fought in the beginning; and if the Bourbons\r\nwere restored, it was only on the implicit condition that the monarchy\r\nshould be nationalized. The Revolutionary democracy, subversive as were\r\nits ideas, had started a new era for the European peoples of national\r\nand international construction.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was by no means obvious in 1815 that a constructive\r\nnational and international principle had come to dominate the European\r\npolitical system. The Treaty of Vienna was an unprincipled compromise\r\namong the divergent interests and claims of the dominant Powers, and the\r\ntriumphant monarchs ignored their promises of national reform or\r\nrepresentation. For one whole generation they resolutely suppressed, so\r\nfar as they were able, every symptom of an insurgent democratic or\r\nnational idea. They sought persistently and ingeniously to identify in\r\nEurope the principle of political integrity and order with the principle\r\nof the legitimate monarchy. But obscurantist as were the ideas and the\r\npolicy of the Holy Alliance, the political system it established was an\r\nenormous improvement upon that of the eighteenth century. Not only was\r\nthe sense of responsibility of the governing classes very much\r\nquickened, but the international system was based on a comparatively\r\nmoral and rational idea. For the first time in European history a group\r\nof rulers, possessing in theory absolute authority and forming an\r\napparently irresistible combination, exercised this power with\r\nmoderation. They did not combine, as in the case of the partition of\r\nPoland, to break the peace and prey upon a defenseless neighbor, but to\r\nkeep the peace; and if to keep the peace meant the suppression wherever\r\npossible of liberal political ideas, it meant also the renunciation of\r\naggressive foreign policies. In this way Europe obtained the rest which\r\nwas necessary after the havoc of the Revolutionary wars, while at the\r\nsame time the principle on which the Holy Alliance was based was being\r\nput to the test of experience. Such a test it could not stand. The\r\npeople of Europe were not content to identify the principle of political\r\norder, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, with that of legitimate\r\nmonarchy and with the arbitrary political alignments of the Treaty of\r\nVienna. Such a settlement ignored the political forces and ideas which,\r\nwhile originating in Revolutionary France, had none the less saved\r\nEurope from the consequences of French Revolutionary and Imperial\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1848, Europe entered upon another period of revolutionary\r\ndisturbance, which completely destroyed the political system of the Holy\r\nAlliance. At the outset these revolutions were no more respectful of\r\nnational traditions than was the French Revolution; and as long as they\r\nremained chiefly subversive in idea and purpose, they accomplished\r\nlittle. But after some unsuccessful experimentation, the new\r\nrevolutionary movement gradually adopted a national programme; and\r\nthereafter, its triumphs were many and varied. For the first time in\r\npolitical history the meaning of the national principle began to be\r\nunderstood; and it became in the most explicit manner a substantial and\r\na formative political idea.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary period taught European statesmen and political\r\nthinkers that political efficiency and responsibility both implied some\r\ndegree of popular representation. Such representation did not\r\nnecessarily go as far as thorough-going democrats would like. It did not\r\nnecessarily transfer the source of political authority from the crown to\r\nthe people. It did not necessarily bring with it, as in France, the\r\noverthrow of those political and social institutions which constituted\r\nthe traditional structure of the national life. But it did imply that\r\nthe government should make itself expressly responsible to public\r\nopinion, and should consult public opinion about all important questions\r\nof public policy. A certain amount of political freedom was shown to be\r\nindispensable to the making of a nation, and the granting of this amount\r\nof political freedom was no more than a fulfillment of the historical\r\nprocess in which the nations of Europe had originated.\r\n\r\nThe people of Europe had drifted into groups, the members of which, for\r\none reason or another, were capable of effective political association.\r\nThis association was not based at bottom on physical conditions. It was\r\nnot dependent on a blood bond, because as a matter of fact the racial\r\ncomposition of the European peoples is exceedingly mixed. It was partly\r\nconditioned on geographical continuity without being necessarily caused\r\nthereby, and was wholly independent of any uniformity of climate. The\r\nassociation was in the beginning largely a matter of convenience or a\r\nmatter of habit. Those associations endured which proved under stress of\r\nhistorical vicissitudes to be worthy of endurance. The longer any\r\nparticular association endured, the more firm it became in political\r\nstructure and the more definite in policy. Its citizens became\r\naccustomed to association one with another, and they became accustomed\r\nto those political and social forms which supplied the machinery of\r\njoint action. Certain institutions and ideas were selected by the\r\npressure of historical events and were capitalized into the effective\r\nlocal political and social traditions. These traditions constituted the\r\nsubstance of the political and social bond. They provided the forms\r\nwhich enabled the people of any group to realize a joint purpose or, if\r\nnecessary, to discuss serious differences. In their absence the very\r\nfoundation of permanent political cohesion was lacking. For a while the\r\nprotection of these groups against domestic and foreign enemies\r\ndemanded, as we have seen, the exercise of an absolute political\r\nauthority and the severe suppression of any but time-honored individual\r\nor class interests; but when comparative order had been secured, a\r\nhigher standard of association gradually came to prevail. Differences of\r\nconviction and interest among individuals and classes, which formerly\r\nwere suppressed or ignored, could no longer be considered either as so\r\ndangerous to public safety as to demand suppression or as so\r\ninsignificant as to justify indifference. Effective association began to\r\ndemand, that is, a new adjustment among the individual and class\r\ninterests, traditions, and convictions which constituted the substance\r\nof any particular state; and such an adjustment could be secured only by\r\nan adequate machinery of consultation and discussion. Cohesion could no\r\nlonger be imposed upon a people, because they no longer had any\r\nsufficient reason to submit to the discipline of such an imposition. It\r\nhad to be reached by an enlarged area of political association, by the\r\nfull expression of individual and class differences, and finally by the\r\nproper adjustment of those differences in relation to the general\r\ninterest of the whole community.\r\n\r\nAs soon as any European state attained, by whatever means, a\r\nrepresentative government, it began to be more of a nation, and to\r\nobtain the advantages of a more nationalized political organization.\r\nEngland's comparative domestic security enabled her to become more of a\r\nnation sooner than any of her continental neighbors; and her national\r\nefficiency forced the French to cultivate their latent power of national\r\nassociation. In France the government finally succeeded in becoming\r\nnationally representative without much assistance from any regular\r\nmachinery of representation; but under such conditions it could not\r\nremain representative. One of its defects as a nation to-day is its lack\r\nof representative institutions to which Frenchmen have been long\r\naccustomed and which command some instinctive loyalty. Stimulated by\r\nFrench and English example, the other European states finally understood\r\nthat some form or degree of popular representation was essential to\r\nnational cohesion; and little by little they have been grafting\r\nrepresentative institutions upon their traditional political structures.\r\nThus the need of political and social cohesion was converted into a\r\nprinciple of constructive national reform. A nation is more or less of a\r\nnation according as its members are more or less capable of effective\r\nassociation; and the great object of a genuinely national domestic\r\npolicy is that of making such association candid, loyal, and fruitful.\r\nLoyal and fruitful association is far from demanding mere uniformity of\r\npurpose and conviction on the part of those associated. On the contrary\r\nit gains enormously from a wide variety of individual differences,--but\r\nwith the essential condition that such differences do not become\r\nfactious in spirit and hostile to the utmost freedom of intercourse. But\r\nthe only way of mitigating factiousness and misunderstanding is by means\r\nof some machinery of mutual consultation, which may help to remedy\r\ngrievances and whose decision shall determine the political action taken\r\nin the name of the whole community. The national principle, that is,\r\nwhich is precisely the principle of loyal and fruitful political\r\nassociation, depends for its vitality upon the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of a constructive relation between the official political\r\norganization and policy and the interests, the ideas, and the traditions\r\nof the people as a whole. The nations of Europe, much as they suffered\r\nfrom the French Revolution and disliked it, owe to the insurgent French\r\ndemocracy their effective instruction in this political truth.\r\n\r\nIt follows, however, that there is no universal and perfect machinery\r\nwhereby loyal and fruitful national association can be secured. The\r\nnations of Europe originated in local political groups, each of which\r\npossessed its own peculiar interests, institutions, and traditions.\r\nTheir power of fruitful national association depended more upon loyalty\r\nto their particular local political tradition and habits than upon any\r\nideal perfection in their new and experimental machinery for\r\ndistributing political responsibility and securing popular\r\nrepresentation. A national policy and organization is, consequently,\r\nessentially particular; and, what is equally important, its particular\r\ncharacter is partly determined by the similarly special character of the\r\npolicy and organization of the surrounding states. The historical\r\nprocess in which each of the European nations originated included, as\r\nan essential element, the action and reaction of these particular states\r\none upon the other. Each nation was formed, that is, as part of a\r\npolitical system which included other nations. As any particular state\r\nbecame more of a nation, its increasing power of effective association\r\nforced its neighbors either into submission or into an equally efficient\r\nexercise of national resistance. Little by little it has been discovered\r\nthat any increase in the loyalty and fertility of a country's domestic\r\nlife was contingent upon the attainment of a more definite position in\r\nthe general European system; and that, on the other hand, any attempt to\r\nescape from the limitations imposed upon a particular state by the\r\ngeneral system was followed by a diminished efficiency in its machinery\r\nof national association.\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of these general principles can, perhaps, be best\r\nexplained by the consideration in relation thereto of the existing\r\npolitical condition of the foremost European nations--Great Britain,\r\nFrance, and Germany. Each of these special cases will afford an\r\nopportunity of exhibiting a new and a significant variation of the\r\nrelation between the principles of nationality and the principles of\r\ndemocracy; and together they should enable us to reach a fairly complete\r\ndefinition of the extent to which, in contemporary Europe, any fruitful\r\nrelation can be established between them. What has already been said\r\nsufficiently indicates that the effective realization of a national\r\nprinciple, even in Europe, demands a certain infusion of democracy; but\r\nit also indicates that this democratic infusion cannot at any one time\r\nbe carried very far without impairing the national integrity. How far,\r\nthen, in these three decisive cases has the democratic infusion been\r\ncarried and what are the consequences, the promise, and the dangers of\r\neach experiment?\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNATIONALITY AND DEMOCRACY IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that England was the first European state\r\nboth in mediæval and modern times to reach a high degree of national\r\nefficiency. At a period when the foreign policies of the continental\r\nstates were exclusively but timidly dynastic, and when their domestic\r\norganizations illustrated the disadvantages of a tepid autocracy, Great\r\nBritain had entered upon a foreign policy of national colonial expansion\r\nand was building up a representative national domestic organization.\r\nAfter several centuries of revolutionary disturbance the English had\r\nregained their national balance, without sacrificing any of the\r\ntime-honored elements in their national life. The monarchy was\r\nreconstituted as the symbol of the national integrity and as the crown\r\nof the social system. The hereditary aristocracy, which was kept in\r\ntouch with the commoners because its younger sons were not noble and\r\nwhich was national, if not liberal, in spirit, became the real rulers of\r\nEngland; but its role was supplemented by an effective though limited\r\nmeasure of general representation. This organization was perfected in\r\nthe nineteenth century. Little by little the area of popular\r\nrepresentation was enlarged, until it included almost the whole adult\r\nmale population; and the government became more and more effectively\r\ncontrolled by national public opinion. As a result of this slowly\r\ngathering but comprehensive plan of national organization, the English\r\nhave become more completely united in spirit and purpose than are the\r\npeople of any other country. The crown and the aristocracy recognize the\r\nlimitations of their positions and their inherited responsibilities to\r\nthe gentry and the people. The commoners on their side are proud of\r\ntheir lords and of the monarchy and grant them full confidence. It is a\r\nunique instance of mutual loyalty and well-distributed responsibility\r\namong social classes, differing widely in station, occupations, and\r\nwealth; and it is founded upon habit of joint consultation, coupled, as\r\nthe result of the long persistence of this habit, with an unusual\r\nsimilarity of intellectual and moral outlook.\r\n\r\nThe result, until recently, was an exceptional degree of national\r\nefficiency; and in scrutinizing this national efficiency the fact must\r\nbe faced that the political success of Great Britain has apparently been\r\ndue, not merely to her adoption of the practice of national\r\nrepresentation, but to her abhorrence of any more subversive democratic\r\nideas. On the one hand, the British have organized a political system\r\nwhich is probably more sensitively and completely responsive to a\r\nnationalized public opinion than is the political system of the\r\nAmerican democracy. On the other hand, this same nationalized political\r\norganization is aristocratic to the core--aristocratic without scruple\r\nor qualification. What is the effect of this aristocratic organization\r\nupon the efficiently and fertility of the English political system? Has\r\nit contributed in the past to such efficiency? Does it still contribute?\r\nAnd if so, how far?\r\n\r\nThe power of the English aristocracy is no doubt to be justified, in\r\npart, by the admirable service which has been rendered to the country by\r\nthe nobility and the gentry. During the eighteenth and a part of the\r\nnineteenth centuries the political leadership of the English people was\r\non the whole both efficient and edifying. During all this period their\r\ncontinental competitors were either burdened with autocratic\r\nobscurantism or else were weakened by civil struggles and the fatal\r\nconsequences of military aggression. In the meantime Great Britain\r\npursued a comparatively tranquil course of domestic reform and colonial\r\nand industrial expansion. She was the European Power whose political and\r\nindustrial energies were most completely liberated and most successfully\r\nused; and as a consequence she naturally drifted into an extremely\r\nself-satisfied state of mind in respect to her political and economic\r\norganization and policy. But during the last quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury political and economic conditions both began to change. The more\r\nimportant competing nations had by that time overcome their internal\r\ndisorders, and by virtue of their domestic reforms had released new\r\nsprings of national energy. Great Britain had to face much severer\r\ncompetition in the fields both of industrial and colonial expansion; and\r\nduring all of these years she has been losing ground. Her expansion has\r\nnot entirely ceased; but industrially she is being left behind by\r\nGermany and by the United States, and her recent colonial acquisitions\r\nhave been attained only at an excessive cost. Inasmuch as she has\r\nsucceeded in retaining her relative superiority on the sea, she has\r\nmaintained her special position in the European political system; but\r\nthe relatively greater responsibilities of the future coupled with her\r\nrelatively smaller resources make her future international standing\r\ndubious. It looks as if there might be something lacking in the national\r\norganization and policy with which Great Britain has been so completely\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nMany Englishmen recognize that their national organization has\r\ndiminished in efficiency, and they are considering various methods of\r\nmeeting the emergency. But to an outsider it does not look as if any\r\nremedy, as yet seriously proposed, was really adequate. The truth is,\r\nthat the existing political, social, and economic organization of Great\r\nBritain both impairs and misleads the energy of the people. It was\r\nadequate to the economic and political conditions of two generations\r\nago, but it is at the present time becoming more and more inadequate. It\r\nis inferior in certain essential respects to the economic and political\r\norganization of Great Britain's two leading competitors--Germany and the\r\nUnited States. It is lacking in purpose. It is lacking in brains. It is\r\nlacking in faith.\r\n\r\nJust as Great Britain benefited enormously during a century and a half\r\nfrom her political precocity, so she is now suffering from the\r\nconsequences thereof. The political temperament of her people, their\r\nmethod of organization, and their national ideals all took form at a\r\ntime when international competition for colonies and trade was not very\r\nsharp, and when democracy had no philosophic or moral standing. At the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century the country was longing for domestic\r\npeace, and it was willing to secure peace at any price save that of\r\nliberty. The leadership of the landed aristocracy and gentry secured to\r\nthe British people domestic peace and civil liberty, and in return for\r\nthese very great blessings they sold themselves to the privileged\r\nclasses. These privileged classes have probably deserved their\r\nprivileges more completely than has the aristocracy of any other\r\ncountry. They have been patriotic; they have shed their blood and spent\r\ntheir money on what they believed to be the national welfare; they\r\nintroduced an honorable and an admirable _esprit de corps_ into the\r\nEnglish public service; and they have been loyal to the great formative\r\nEnglish political idea--the idea of liberty. They have granted to the\r\npeople from time to time as much liberty as public opinion demanded, and\r\nhave in this way maintained to the present day their political and\r\nsocial prestige. But although they have been, on the whole, individually\r\ndisinterested, they have not been and they could not be disinterested as\r\na class. Owning as they did much of the land, they had as a class\r\ncertain economic interests. Possessing as they did certain special\r\nprivileges, they had as a class certain political interests. These\r\ninterests have been scrupulously preserved, no matter whether they did\r\nor did not conflict with the national interest. Their landed\r\nproprietorship has resulted in certain radical inequalities of taxation\r\nand certain grave economic drawbacks. Their position as a privileged\r\nclass made them hospitable only to those reforms which spared their\r\nprivileges. But their privileges could not be spared, provided\r\nEnglishmen allowed rational ideas any decisive influence in their\r\npolitical life; and the consequence of this abstention from ideas was\r\nthe gradual cultivation of a contempt for intelligence, an excessive\r\nworship of tradition, and a deep-rooted faith in the value of\r\ncompromise. In the interest of domestic harmony they have identified\r\ncomplacent social subserviency with the virtue of loyalty, and have\r\nerected compromise into an ultimate principle of political action.\r\n\r\nThe landed aristocracy and gentry of England have been obliged to face\r\nonly one serious crisis--the prolonged crisis occasioned by the\r\ntransformation of Great Britain from an agricultural to an industrial\r\ncommunity. The way the English privileged classes preserved their\r\npolitical leadership during a period, in which land was ceasing to be\r\nthe source of Great Britain's economic prosperity, is an extraordinary\r\nillustration of their political tact and social prestige. But it must be\r\nadded that their leadership has been preserved more in name than in\r\nsubstance. The aristocracy managed to keep its prestige and its apparent\r\npower during the course of the industrial revolution, but only on\r\ncondition of the abandonment of the substance thereof. The nobility and\r\nthe gentry became the privileged servants of the rising middle class.\r\nThey bought off their commercial and industrial conquerors with the\r\nconcession of free trade, because at the time such a concession did not\r\nseem to injure their own interests; and they agreed to let the English\r\nbusiness man practically dictate the national policy. In this way they\r\npreserved their political and social privileges and have gradually so\r\nidentified the interests of the well-to-do middle class with their\r\ninterest that the two have become scarcely distinguishable. The\r\naristocracy of privilege and the aristocracy of wealth are absolutely\r\nunited in their devotion to the existing political organization and\r\npolicy of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis bargain appeared to work very well for a while; but indications are\r\naccumulating that a let-alone economic policy has not preserved the\r\nvitality of the British economic system. The English farmer has lost\r\nambition, and has been sacrificed to the industrial growth of the\r\nnation, while the industrial growth itself no longer shows its former\r\npower of expansion. The nation passed the responsibility for its\r\neconomic welfare on to the individual; and the individual with all his\r\nenergy and initiative seems unable to hold his own against better\r\norganized competition. Its competitors have profited by the very\r\nqualities which Great Britain renounced when she accepted the\r\nanti-national liberalism of the Manchester school. They have shown under\r\nwidely different conditions the power of nationalizing their economic\r\norganization; and in spite of the commission of many errors,\r\nparticularly in this country, a system of national economy appears to\r\nmake for a higher level of economic vitality than a system of\r\ninternational economy. \"At the present time,\" says Mr. O. Elzbacher in\r\nhis \"Modern Germany,\" \"when other nations are no longer divided against\r\nthemselves, but have become homogeneous unified nations in fact and\r\nnations in organization, and when the most progressive nations have\r\nbecome gigantic institutions for self-improvement and gigantic business\r\nconcerns on coöperative principles, the spasmodic individual efforts of\r\npatriotic and energetic Englishmen and their unorganized individual\r\naction prove less efficient for the good of their country than they were\r\nformerly.\" The political leaders of England abandoned, that is, all\r\nleadership in economic affairs and allowed a merely individualistic\r\nliberalism complete control of the fiscal and economic policy of the\r\ncountry. The government resigned economic responsibility at the very\r\ntime when English economic interests began to need vigilant protection\r\nand promotion; and as a consequence of this resignation the English\r\ngoverning class practically surrendered its primary function. What\r\nseemed to be an easy transferal to more competent shoulders of the\r\nnational responsibility for the economic welfare of the country has\r\nproved to be a betrayal of the national interest.\r\n\r\nFiscal reform alone will, however, never enable Great Britain to compete\r\nmore vigorously with either the United States or Germany. The diminished\r\neconomic vitality of England must be partly traced to her tradition of\r\npolitical and social subserviency, which serves to rob both the ordinary\r\nand the exceptional Englishmen of energy and efficiency. American\r\nenergy, so far as it is applied to economic tasks, is liberated not\r\nmerely by the abundance of its opportunities, but by the prevailing idea\r\nthat every man should make as much of himself as he can; and in\r\nobedience to this idea the average American works with all his might\r\ntowards some special personal goal. The energy of the average\r\nEnglishman, on the other hand, is impaired by his complacent acceptance\r\nof positions of social inferiority and by his worship of degrading\r\nsocial distinctions; and even successful Englishmen suffer from a\r\nsimilar handicap. The latter rarely push their business successes home,\r\nbecause they themselves immediately begin to covet a place in the social\r\nhierarchy, and to that end are content with a certain established\r\nincome. The pleasure which the average Englishman seems to feel in\r\nlooking up to the \"upper classes\" is only surpassed by the pleasure\r\nwhich the exceptional Englishman seems to feel in looking down on the\r\n\"lower classes.\" Englishmen have always congratulated themselves because\r\ntheir nobility was not a caste; but the facts that the younger sons of\r\nthe peers are commoners, and that a distinguished commoner may earn a\r\npeerage, only makes the poison of these arbitrary social discriminations\r\nthe more deadly. An Englishman always has a chance of winning an\r\nirrelevant but very gratifying social and political privilege. He may by\r\nacceptable services of the ordinary kind become as good as a lord. Some\r\nsuch ambition is nearly always the end to which the energy of the\r\nsuccessful Englishman is directed, and its particular nature hinders him\r\nfrom realizing the special purpose of his own life with an unimpeded\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe net result of the English system is to infect English social,\r\npolitical, military, and industrial life with social favoritism, and the\r\npoison of the infection is only mitigated by the condition that the\r\n\"favorites\" must deserve their selection by the maintenance of a certain\r\nstandard. This standard was formed a good many years ago when the\r\nconditions of efficiency were not so exacting as they are to-day. At\r\nthat time it was a sufficiently high standard and made, on the whole,\r\nfor successful achievement. It demanded of the \"favorite\" that he be\r\nhonest, patriotic, well-educated, gentlemanly, courageous, and a \"good\r\nsort,\" but it wholly failed to demand high special training, intense\r\napplication, unremitting energy, or any exclusive devotion to one's\r\npeculiar work. If an Englishman comes up to the regular standard, he can\r\nusually obtain his share of the good things of English life; but if he\r\ngoes beyond, he falls under the social disqualification of being\r\nabnormal and peculiar. The standard, consequently, is not now an\r\nefficient standard; and it is frequently applied with some laxity to the\r\nmembers of the privileged classes. A tacit conspiracy naturally exists\r\namong people in such a position to make it easy for their associates,\r\nfriends, and relatives. The props and chances offered to a boy born into\r\nthis class make the very most of his probably moderate deserts and\r\nabilities, and in occupying a position of responsibility he inevitably\r\ndisplaces a more competent substitute. In our own country the enjoyment\r\nof such political favors is known as a \"pull,\" and is a popular but\r\ndisreputable method of political advancement, whereas in England the\r\nwhole social, and a large part of the political, structure is\r\nconstituted on the basis of a systematic and hereditary \"pull.\" The\r\nspirit thereof is highly honored in the most sacred precincts of English\r\nlife. It is supported heartily and unscrupulously by English public\r\nopinion, and its critics are few and insignificant.\r\n\r\nWhen Englishmen come to understand the need of dissociating their\r\nnational idea from its existing encumbrances of political privilege and\r\nsocial favoritism, they will be confronted by a reconstructive task of\r\npeculiar difficulty. The balance of the national life, which has been so\r\nslowly and painfully recovered, will be endangered by the weakening of\r\nany of its present supports. For centuries the existing system has been\r\nwrought with the utmost patience and patriotism; and an Englishman may\r\nwell shudder at the notion of any essential modification. The good of\r\nthe system is so mixed with the evil that it seems impossible to\r\nextricate and eradicate the latter without endangering English national\r\ncohesion. Their traditional faith in compromise, their traditional dread\r\nof ideas, their traditional habit of acting first and reasoning\r\nafterwards, has made the English system a hopelessly confused bundle of\r\nsemi-efficiency and semi-inefficiency--just as it has made the best\r\nEnglish social type a gentleman, but a gentleman absolutely conditioned,\r\ntempered, and supplemented by a flunky.\r\n\r\nWhile the process of becoming more of a democracy may very well\r\ninjure--at any rate for a while--English national consistency, England's\r\nfuture as a nation is compromised by her fear of democracy. She has\r\nbuilt her national organization on the idea that the national welfare is\r\nbetter promoted by a popular loyalty which entails popular immobility,\r\nthan by the exercise on the part of the people of a more individual and\r\nless subservient intellectual and moral energy. In so doing she has for\r\nthe time being renounced one of the greatest advantages of a national\r\npolitical and social organization--the advantage of combining great\r\npopular energy with loyalty and fertility of association. No doubt\r\ncertain nations, because of their perilous international situation, may\r\nbe obliged to sacrifice the moral and economic individuality of the\r\npeople to the demands of political security and efficiency. But Great\r\nBritain suffered from no such necessity. After the fall of Napoleon, she\r\nwas more secure from foreign interference than ever before in her\r\nhistory; and she could have afforded, with far less risk than France, to\r\nidentify her national principle with the work of popular liberation and\r\namelioration. As a matter of fact, the logic of the reform movement\r\nwhich began in England soon after the Treaty of Vienna, required the\r\nadoption by England either of more democracy or of less. The privileged\r\nclasses should either have fought to preserve their peculiar\r\nresponsibility for the national welfare, or else, if they were obliged\r\nto surrender their inherited leadership, they should have also\r\nsurrendered their political and social privileges. But Englishmen,\r\nterrified by the disasters which French democratic nationalism had\r\nwrought upon France, preferred domestic harmony to the perils of any\r\nradical readjustment of the balance of their national life. The\r\naristocracy and the middle classes compromised their differences; and in\r\nthe compromise each of them sacrificed the principle upon which the\r\nvitality of its action as a class depended, while both of them combined\r\nto impose subordination on the mass of the people.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen have, it is true, always remained faithful to their dominant\r\npolitical idea--the idea of freedom, and the English political and\r\neconomic system is precisely the example of the ultimate disadvantage of\r\nbasing national cohesion upon the application of such a limited\r\nprinciple. This principle, as we have seen in the preceding chapter,\r\nalways operates for the benefit of a minority, whose whole object, after\r\nthey have once won certain peculiar advantages, is to secure their\r\nperpetuation. The wealthy middle class, which at one time was the\r\nbackbone of the Liberal party, has for the most part gone over to the\r\nConservatives, because its interest has become as much opposed to\r\npolitical and economic egalitarianism as is that of the aristocracy: and\r\nthe mass of the English people, whose liberation can never be\r\naccomplished under the existing régime of political and economic\r\nprivilege, looks with complacency and awe upon the good time enjoyed by\r\ntheir betters. Popular bondage is the price of national consistency. A\r\ncentury of industrial expansion and over half a century of free trade\r\nhas left the English people miserably poor and contentedly hopeless; and\r\nin the future the people cannot depend upon any increase even of the\r\nsmall share of the benefits of industrial expansion, which they have\r\nhitherto obtained, because the national expansion is itself proceeding\r\nat a much slower rate. The dole, which is now being accorded in the\r\nshape of old-age pensions, may fairly be compared to the free\r\ntransportation to their homes with which the Bank of Monte Carlo\r\nassuages the feelings of its destitute victims. The national\r\norganization and policy is so arranged that the majority must lose. The\r\nresult will be inevitably a diminution of the ability of the United\r\nKingdom to hold its own in competition with its economic and political\r\nrivals; and in all probability this pressure from the outside will\r\neventually force the English nation to reconsider the basis of its\r\npolitical and economic organization and policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY AND NATIONALITY IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nThe recent history and the present position of France illustrate another\r\nphase of the interdependence of the national and the democratic\r\nprinciples. The vitality of English national life has been impaired by\r\nits identification with an inadequate and aristocratic political\r\nprinciple. In France the effective vitality of the democracy has been\r\nvery much lowered by certain flaws in the integrity of French national\r\nlife. France is strong where England is weak and is weak where England\r\nis strong; and this divergence of development is by no means accidental.\r\nJust because they were the first countries to become effectively\r\nnationalized, their action and reaction have been constant and have\r\nserved at once to develop and distinguish their national temperaments.\r\nThe English invasions accelerated the growth of the French royal power\r\nand weakened domestic resistance to its ambitions. The English\r\nrevolutions of the seventeenth century made the Bourbons more than ever\r\ndetermined to consolidate the royal despotism and to stamp out\r\nProtestantism. The excesses of the French royal despotism brought as a\r\nconsequence the excesses of the Revolutionary democracy. The Reign of\r\nTerror in its turn made Englishmen more than ever suspicious of the\r\napplication of rational political ideas to the fabric of English\r\nsociety. So the ball was tossed back and forth--the national temperament\r\nof each people being at once profoundly modified by this action and\r\nreaction and for the same cause profoundly distinguished one from the\r\nother. The association has been more beneficial to France than to\r\nEngland, because the French, both before and after the Revolution,\r\nreally tried to learn something from English political experience,\r\nwhereas the English have never been able to discover anything in the\r\npolitical experience of their neighbors, except an awful example of the\r\ndanger of democratic ideas and political and social rationalism.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of the French democracy were in the beginning revolutionary,\r\ndisorderly, and subversive of national consistency and good faith. No\r\ndoubt the French democracy had a much better excuse for identifying\r\ndemocracy with a system of abstract rights and an indiscriminate\r\nindividualism than had the American democracy. The shadow of the Old\r\nRégime hung over the country; and it seemed as if the newly won civil\r\nand political rights could be secured only by erecting them into\r\nabsolute conditions of just political association and by surrounding\r\nthem with every possible guarantee. Moreover, the natural course of the\r\nFrench democratic development was perverted by foreign interference and\r\na constant condition of warfare; and if the French nation had been\r\nallowed to seek its own political salvation without interference, as was\r\nthis English nation, the French democracy might have been saved many an\r\nerror and excess. But whatever excuses may be found for the disorders of\r\nthe French democracy, the temporary effect of the democratic idea upon\r\nthe national fabric was, undoubtedly, a rending of the roots of their\r\nnational stability and good feeling. The successive revolutionary\r\nexplosions, which have constituted so much of French history since 1789,\r\nhave made France the victim of what sometimes seem to be mutually\r\nexclusive conceptions of French national well-being. The democratic\r\nradicals are \"intransigeant.\" The party of tradition and authority is\r\n\"ultramontane.\" The majority of moderate and sensible people are usually\r\nin control; but their control is unstable. The shadow of the Terror and\r\nthe Commune hangs over every serious crisis in French politics. The\r\nradicals jump to the belief that the interests and rights of the people\r\nhave been betrayed and that the traitors should be exterminated. Good\r\nFrenchmen suffer during those crises from an obsession of suspicion and\r\nfear. Their mutual loyalty, their sense of fair play, and their natural\r\nkindliness are all submerged under a tyranny of desperate apprehension.\r\nThe social bond is unloosed, and the prudent bourgeois thinks only of\r\nthe preservation of person and property.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the French democracy can, however, easily be\r\nover-emphasized and usually is over-emphasized by foreigners. It is\r\nundoubtedly a living element in the composition of the contemporary\r\nFrance; but it was less powerful at the time of the Commune than at the\r\ntime of the Terror, and is less powerful to-day than it was in 1871.\r\nFrench political history in the nineteenth century is not to be regarded\r\nas a succession of meaningless revolutions, born of a spirit of reckless\r\nand factious insubordination, but as the route whereby a people,\r\ninexperienced in self-government, have been gradually traveling towards\r\nthe kind of self-government best fitted to their needs. It is entirely\r\npossible that the existing Republic, modified perhaps for the purpose of\r\nobtaining a more independent and a more vigorous executive authority,\r\nmay in the course of time give France the needed political and social\r\nstability. That form of government which was adopted at the time,\r\nbecause it divided Frenchmen the least, may become the form of\r\ngovernment which unites Frenchmen by the strongest ties. Bismarck's\r\nmisunderstanding of the French national character and political needs\r\nwas well betrayed when he favored a Republic rather than a Legitimist\r\nmonarchy in France, because a French Republic would, in his opinion,\r\nnecessarily keep France a weak and divided neighbor. The Republic has\r\nkept France divided, but it has been less divided than it would have\r\nbeen under any monarchical government. It has successfully weathered a\r\nnumber of very grave domestic crises; and its perpetuity will probably\r\ndepend primarily upon its ability to secure and advance by practical\r\nmeans the international standing of France. The Republic has been\r\nobliged to meet a foreign peril more prolonged and more dangerous than\r\nthat which has befallen any French government since 1600. From the time\r\nof Richelieu until 1870, France was stronger than any of her continental\r\nneighbors. Unless they were united against her she had little to fear\r\nfrom them; and her comparative strength tempted her to be aggressive,\r\ncareless, and experimental in her foreign policy. That policy was\r\nvacillating, purposeless, and frequently wasteful of the national\r\nresources. Eventually, it compromised the international position of\r\nFrance. After 1871, for the first time in almost three hundred years,\r\nthe very safety of France in a time of peace became actively and gravely\r\nimperiled. The third Republic reaped the fruit of all the former\r\ntrifling with the national interest of France and that of its neighbors;\r\nand the resulting danger was and is so ominous and so irretrievable that\r\nit has made and will make for internal stability. If the Republic can\r\nprovide for French national defense and can keep for France the position\r\nin Europe to which she is entitled, the Republic will probably endure.\r\nAnd in that case it will certainly deserve to endure, because it will\r\nhave faced and overcome the most exacting possible national peril.\r\n\r\nEven the most loyal friend of France can, however, hardly claim that the\r\nFrench democracy is even yet thoroughly nationalized. It has done\r\nsomething to obtain national cohesion at home, and to advance the\r\nnational interest abroad; but evidences of the traditional dissociation\r\nbetween French democracy and French national efficiency and consistency\r\nare still plainly visible. Both the domestic and the foreign policies of\r\nthe Republic have of late years been weakened by the persistence of a\r\nfactious and anti-national spirit among radical French democrats.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous symptom of this anti-national democracy is that an\r\napparently increasing number of educated Frenchmen are rebelling against\r\nthe burdens imposed upon the Republic by its perilous international\r\nposition. They are tending to seek security and relief, not by\r\nstrengthening the national bond and by loyalty to the fabric of their\r\nnational life, but by personal disloyalty and national dissolution. The\r\nmost extreme of democratic socialists do not hesitate to advocate armed\r\nrebellion against military service in the interest of international\r\npeace. They would fight their fellow-countrymen in order to promote a\r\nunion with foreigners. How far views of this kind have come to prevail,\r\nan outsider cannot very well judge; but they are said to be popular\r\namong the school teachers, and to have impaired the discipline of the\r\narmy itself. Authoritative French journals claim that France cannot\r\nafford to run the risk of incurring the ill-will of Germany, even in a\r\ngood cause, because the country is no longer sure of its military\r\nefficiency. There is no present danger of this anti-nationalist\r\ndemocracy capturing control of the French government, as did the\r\nrevolutionary democracy at an earlier date; but its existence is a\r\nsource of weakness to a nation whose perilous international situation\r\nrequires the most absolute patriotic devotion on the part of her sons.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is also true that the official domestic policy of the\r\nRepublic is not informed by a genuinely national spirit. Just as the\r\nEnglish national interest demands the temporary loosening of traditional\r\nbonds for the sake of securing national cohesion at a smaller sacrifice\r\nof popular vitality, so, on the contrary, the French national interest\r\ndemands more of the English spirit of compromise for the sake of\r\nnational consistency. The wounds dealt to the integrity of French\r\nnational life by the domestic conflicts of four generations require\r\nbinding and healing. The Third Republic has on the whole been more\r\nnational in its domestic policy than were any of the preceding French\r\ngovernments for over two hundred years; but it has still fallen far\r\nshort of its duty in that respect. The healing of one wound has always\r\nbeen followed by the opening of another. Irreconcilable differences of\r\nopinion still subsist; and they are rarely bridged or dissolved by any\r\nfundamental loyalty of patriotic feeling. The French have as yet been\r\nunable to find in their democracy any conscious ideal of mutual loyalty\r\nwhich provides a sufficient substitute for a merely instinctive national\r\ntradition. They have not yet come to realize that the success of their\r\nwhole democratic experiment depends upon their ability to reach a good\r\nunderstanding with their fellow-countrymen, and, that just in so far as\r\ntheir democracy fails to be nationally constructive, it is ignoring the\r\nmost essential condition of its own vitality and perpetuity.\r\n\r\nThe French democracy is confronted by an economic, as well as a\r\npolitical, problem of peculiar difficulty. The effects of the Revolution\r\nwere no less important upon the distribution of wealth in France than\r\nupon the distribution of political power. The people came into the\r\nownership of the land; and in the course of time the area of this\r\ndistribution has been increased rather than diminished. Furthermore, the\r\nlaws under which property in France is inherited have promoted a\r\nsimilarly wide distribution of personal estate. France is a rich\r\ncountry; and its riches are much more evenly divided than is the case in\r\nGreat Britain, Germany, or the United States. There are fewer large\r\nfortunes, and fewer cases of poverty. The average Frenchman is a small,\r\nbut extremely thrifty proprietor, who abhors speculation and is always\r\nmanaging to add something to his accumulations; and the French economic\r\nsystem is adapted to this peculiar distribution of wealth. The scarcity\r\nin France of iron and coal has checked the tendency to industrial\r\norganization on a huge scale. The strength of the French industrial\r\nsystem does not consist in the large and efficient use of machinery, but\r\nin its multitude of skilled craftsmen and the excellence of their\r\nhandiwork. In a system of this kind, labor naturally receives a large\r\npercentage of the gross product, and a larger proportion of wage-earners\r\nreach an independent economic position. At first sight it looks as if\r\nFrance was something like a genuine economic democracy, and ought to\r\nescape the evils which threaten other countries from an economic\r\norganization, in which concentrated capital plays a more important part.\r\n\r\nBut the situation is not without another and less favorable aspect.\r\nFrance, in becoming a country of small and extremely thrifty property\r\nowners, has also become a country of partial economic parasites with\r\nvery little personal initiative and energy. Individual freedom has been\r\nsacrificed to economic and social equality; and this economic and social\r\nequality has not made for national cohesion. The bourgeois, the\r\nmechanic, and the farmer, in so far as they have accumulated property,\r\nare exhibiting an extremely calculating individualism, of which the most\r\ndangerous symptom is the decline in the birth-rate. Frenchmen are\r\nbecoming more than ever disinclined to take the risks and assume the\r\nexpense of having more than one or two children. The recent outbreak of\r\nanti-militarism is probably merely another illustration of the\r\nincreasing desire of the French bourgeois for personal security, and the\r\nopportunity for personal enjoyment. To a foreigner it looks as if the\r\ngrave political and social risks, which the French nation has taken\r\nsince 1789, had gradually cultivated in individual Frenchmen an\r\nexcessive personal prudence, which adds to the store of national wealth,\r\nbut which no more conduces to economic, social, and political efficiency\r\nthan would the incarceration of a fine army in a fortress conduce to\r\nmilitary success. A nation or an individual who wishes to accomplish\r\ngreat things must be ready, in Nietsche's phrase, \"to lived\r\nangerously\"--to take those risks, without which no really great\r\nachievement is possible; and if Frenchmen persist in erecting the virtue\r\nof thrift and the demand for safety into the predominant national\r\ncharacteristic, they are merely beginning a process of national\r\ncorruption and dissolution.\r\n\r\nThat any such result is at all imminent, I do not for a moment believe.\r\nThe time will come when the danger of the present drift will be\r\nunderstood, and will create its sufficient remedy; and all good friends\r\nof democracy and human advancement should hope and believe that France\r\nwill retain indefinitely her national vitality. If she should drift into\r\nan insignificant position in relation to her neighbors, a void would be\r\ncreated which it would be impossible to fill and which would react\r\ndeleteriously upon the whole European system. But such a result is only\r\nto be avoided by the general recognition among Frenchmen that the means\r\nwhich they are adopting to render their personal position more secure is\r\nrendering their national situation more precarious. The fate of the\r\nFrench democracy is irrevocably tied up with the fate of French\r\nnational life, and the best way for a Frenchman to show himself a good\r\ndemocrat is to make those sacrifices and to take those risks necessary\r\nfor the prestige and welfare of his country.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF GERMAN NATIONALITY TO DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nThe German Empire presents still another phase of the relation between\r\ndemocracy and nationality, and one which helps considerably towards an\r\nunderstanding of the varied possibilities of that relationship. The\r\nGerman national organization and policy was wrought in a manner entirely\r\ndifferent from that of either France or England. In the two latter\r\ncountries political freedom was conquered only as the result of\r\nsuccessive revolutions; and the ruling classes were obliged to recognize\r\nthe source of these political reformations by renouncing all or a large\r\npart of their inherited responsibilities. In Germany, on the other hand,\r\nor rather in Prussia as the maker of modern Germany, the various changes\r\nin the national organization and policy, which have resulted in the\r\nfounding of a united nation, originated either with the crown or with\r\nthe royal counselors. The Prussian monarchy has, consequently, passed\r\nthrough the revolutionary period without abandoning its political\r\nleadership of the Prussian state. It has created a national\r\nrepresentative body; but it has not followed the English example and\r\nallowed such a body to tie its hands; and it has remained, consequently,\r\nthe most completely responsible and representative monarchy in Europe.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time this responsibility and power have on the whole\r\nbeen deserved by the manner in which they have been exercised. German\r\nnationality as an efficient political and economic force has been\r\nwrought by skillful and patriotic management out of materials afforded\r\nby military and political opportunities and latent national ties and\r\ntraditions. During the eighteenth century the Prussian monarchy came to\r\nunderstand that the road to effective political power in Germany was by\r\nway of a military efficiency, disproportionate to the resources and\r\npopulation of the Kingdom. In this way it was able to take advantage of\r\nalmost every important crisis to increase its dominion and its\r\nprestige. Neither was Prussian national efficiency built up merely by a\r\nwell-devised and practicable policy of military aggression. The Prussian\r\nmonarchy had the good sense to accept the advice of domestic reformers\r\nduring its period of adversity, and so contributed to the economic\r\nliberation and the educational training of its subjects. Thus the modern\r\nGerman nation has been at bottom the work of admirable leadership on the\r\npart of officially responsible leaders; and among those leaders the man\r\nwho planned most effectively and accomplished the greatest results was\r\nOtto von Bismarck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt requires a very special study of European history after 1848 to\r\nunderstand how bold, how original, how comprehensive, and how adequate\r\nfor their purpose Bismarck's ideas and policy gradually became; and it\r\nrequires a very special study of Bismarck's own biography to understand\r\nthat his personal career, with all its transformations, exhibits an\r\nequally remarkable integrity. The Bismarck of from 1848 to 1851 is\r\nusually described as a country squire, possessed by obscurantist\r\nmediæval ideas wholly incompatible with his own subsequent policy. But\r\nwhile there are many superficial contradictions between the country\r\nsquire of 1848 and the Prussian Minister and German Chancellor, the\r\nreally peculiar quality of Bismarck's intelligence was revealed in his\r\nability to develop a constructive German national policy out of the\r\nprejudices and ideas of a Prussian \"junker.\" Bismarck, in 1848, was\r\nprimarily an ardent Prussian patriot who believed that the monarchy was\r\ndivinely authorized to govern the Prussian people, and that any\r\ndiminution of this responsibility was false in principle and would be\r\nbaleful in its results. These ideas led him, in 1848, to oppose the\r\nconstitution, granted by Frederick William IV and to advocate the\r\nrepression of all revolutionary upheavals. He never essentially departed\r\nfrom these principles; but his experience gradually taught him that they\r\nwere capable of a different and more edifying application. The point of\r\nview from which his policy, his achievements, and his career can best be\r\nunderstood is that of a patriotic Prussian who was exclusively,\r\nintelligently, and unscrupulously devoted to the welfare (as he\r\nconceived it) of his country and his king. As a loyal Prussian he wished\r\nto increase Prussian influence among the other German states, because\r\nthat was the only way to improve her standing and greatness as a\r\nEuropean Power; and he soon realized that Austria constituted the great\r\nobstacle to any such increase of Prussian influence. He and he only drew\r\nthe one sufficient inference from this fact. Inasmuch as Prussia's\r\nfuture greatness and efficiency depended absolutely on the increase of\r\nher influence in Germany, and inasmuch as Austria barred her path,\r\nPrussia must be prepared to fight Austria, and must make every possible\r\nprovision, both diplomatic and military, to bring such a war to a\r\nsuccessful issue. Such a purpose meant, of course, the abandonment of\r\nthe policy which Prussia had pursued for a whole generation. The one\r\ninterest which Bismarck wanted the Prussian government to promote was\r\nthe Prussian interest, no matter whether that interest meant opposition\r\nto the democracy or coöperation therewith; and the important point in\r\nthe realization of this exclusive policy is that he soon found himself\r\nin need of the help of the German democratic movement. His resolute and\r\ncandid nationalism in the end forced him to enter into an alliance with\r\nthe very democracy which he had begun by detesting.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, also, that he had in the beginning reason to\r\ndistrust the Prussian and the German democracy. The German radicals had\r\nsought to compass the unification of Germany by passing resolutions and\r\nmaking speeches; but such methods, which are indispensable accessories\r\nto the good government of an established national community, were\r\nutterly incompetent to remove the obstacles to German unity. These\r\nobstacles consisted in the particularism of the German princes, the\r\nopposition of Austria, and looming in the background the possible\r\nopposition of France; and Bismarck alone thoroughly understood that such\r\nobstacles could be removed by war and war only. But in order to wage war\r\nsuccessfully, a country must be well-armed; and in the attempt to arm\r\nPrussia so that she would be equal to asserting her interests in\r\nGermany, Bismarck and the king had to face the stubborn opposition of\r\nthe Prussian representative assembly. Bismarck did not flinch from\r\nfighting the Prussian assembly in the national interest any more than he\r\nflinched under different circumstances from calling the German democracy\r\nto his aid. When by this policy, at once bold and cautious, of Prussian\r\naggrandizement, he had succeeded in bringing about war with Austria, he\r\nfearlessly announced a plan of partial unification, based upon the\r\nsupremacy of Prussia and a national parliament elected by universal\r\nsuffrage; and after the defeat of Austria, he successfully carried this\r\nplan into effect. It so happened that the special interest of Prussia\r\ncoincided with the German national interest. It was Prussia's effective\r\nmilitary power which defeated Austria and forced the princes to abate\r\ntheir particularist pretensions. It was Prussia's comparatively larger\r\npopulation which made Bismarck insist that the German nation should be\r\nan efficient popular union rather than a mere federation of states. And\r\nit was Bismarck's experience with the anti-nationalism \"liberalism\" of\r\nthe Prussian assembly, elected as it was by a very restricted suffrage,\r\nwhich convinced him that the national interest could be as well trusted\r\nto the good sense and the patriotism of the whole people as to the\r\nspecial interests of the \"bourgeoisie.\" Thus little by little the\r\nfertile seed of Bismarck's Prussian patriotism grew into a German\r\nsemi-democratic nationalism, and it achieved this transformation without\r\nany essential sacrifice of its own integrity. He had been working in\r\nPrussia's interest throughout, but he saw clearly just where the\r\nPrussian interest blended with the German national interest, and just\r\nwhat means, whether by way of military force or popular approval, were\r\nnecessary for the success of his patriotic policy.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prussian Minister-President became the Imperial Chancellor, he\r\npursued in the larger field a similar purpose by different means. The\r\nGerman national Empire had been founded by means of the forcible\r\ncoercion of its domestic and foreign opponents. It remained now to\r\norganize and develop the new national state; and the government, under\r\nBismark's lead, made itself responsible for the task of organization and\r\ndevelopment, just as it had made itself responsible for the task of\r\nunification. According to the theories of democratic individualistic\r\n\"liberalism,\" such an effort could only result in failure, because from\r\nthe liberal point of view the one way to develop a modern industrial\r\nnation was simply to allow the individual every possible liberty. But\r\nBismarck's whole scheme of national industrial organization looked in a\r\nvery different direction. He believed that the nation itself, as\r\nrepresented by its official leaders, should actively assist in preparing\r\nan adequate national domestic policy, and in organizing the machinery\r\nfor its efficient execution. He saw clearly that the logic and the\r\npurpose of the national type of political organization was entirely\r\ndifferent from that of a so-called free democracy, as explained in the\r\nphilosophy of the German liberals of 1848, the Manchester school in\r\nEngland, or our own Jeffersonian Democrats; and he successfully\r\ntransformed his theory of responsible administrative activity into a\r\ncomprehensive national policy. The army was, if anything, increased in\r\nstrength, so that it might remain fully adequate either for national\r\ndefense or as an engine of German international purposes. A beginning\r\nwas made toward the creation of a navy. A moderate but explicit\r\nprotectionist policy was adopted, aimed not at the special development\r\neither of rural or manufacturing industries, but at the all-round\r\ndevelopment of Germany as an independent national economic unit. In\r\nPrussia itself the railways were bought by the government, so that they\r\nshould be managed, not in the interest of the shareholders, but in that\r\nof the national economic system. The government encouraged the spread of\r\nbettor farming methods, which have resulted in the gradual increase in\r\nthe yield per acre of every important agricultural staple. The\r\neducational system of the country was made of direct assistance to\r\nindustry, because it turned out skilled scientific experts, who used\r\ntheir knowledge to promote industrial efficiency. In every direction\r\nGerman activity was organized and was placed under skilled professional\r\nleadership, while at the same time each of these special lines of work\r\nwas subordinated to its particular place in a comprehensive scheme of\r\nnational economy. This \"paternalism\" has, moreover, accomplished its\r\npurpose. German industrial expansion surpasses in some respects that of\r\nthe United States, and has left every European nation far behind.\r\nGermany alone among the modern European nations is, in spite of the\r\ntemporary embarrassment of Imperial finance, carrying the cost of modern\r\nmilitary preparation easily, and looks forward confidently to greater\r\nsuccesses in the future. She is at the present time a very striking\r\nexample of what can be accomplished for the popular welfare by a\r\nfearless acceptance on the part of the official leaders of economic as\r\nwell as political responsibility, and by the efficient and intelligent\r\nuse of all available means to that end.\r\n\r\nInevitably, however, Germany is suffering somewhat from the excess of\r\nher excellent qualities. Her leaders were not betrayed by the success of\r\ntheir foreign and domestic policies to attempt the immediate\r\naccomplishment of purposes, incommensurate with the national power and\r\nresources; but they were tempted to become somewhat overbearing in their\r\nattitude toward their domestic and foreign opponents. No doubt a\r\nposition which was conquered by aggressive leadership must be maintained\r\nby aggressive leadership; and no doubt, consequently, the German\r\nImperial Power could not well avoid the appearance and sometimes the\r\nsubstance of being domineering. But the consequence of the Bismarckian\r\ntradition of bullying and browbeating one's opponents has been that of\r\nintensifying the opposition to the national policy and of compromising\r\nits success. France has been able to escape from the isolation in which\r\nshe was long kept by Bismarck after the war, and has gradually built up\r\na series of understandings with other Powers, more or less inimical to\r\nGermany. The latter's standing in Europe is not as high as it was ten\r\nyears ago, in spite of the increased relative efficiency of her army,\r\nher navy, and her economic system. Moreover, an equally serious and\r\ndangerous opposition has been created at home. The government has not\r\nsucceeded in retaining the loyal support of a large fraction of the\r\nGerman people. A party which is composed for the most part of\r\nworkingmen, and which has been increasing steadily in the number of its\r\nadherents, is utterly opposed to the present policy and organization of\r\nthe Imperial government; and those Social Democrats have for the most\r\npart been treated by the authorities with repressive laws and abusive\r\nepithets. Thus a schism is being created in the German national system\r\nwhich threatens to become a source of serious weakness to the national\r\nefficiency and strength.\r\n\r\nThat the existence of some such domestic opposition is to a certain\r\nextent unavoidable must be admitted. A radical incompatibility exists\r\nbetween the national policy of the Imperial and Prussian governments and\r\nthe Social Democratic programme; and the Imperial authorities could not\r\nconciliate the Social Democrats without abandoning the peculiar\r\norganization and policy which have been largely so responsible for the\r\nextraordinary increase in the national well-being. On the other hand, it\r\nmust also be remembered that the Prussian royal power has maintained its\r\nnationally representative character and its responsible leadership quite\r\nas much by its ability to meet legitimate popular grievances and needs\r\nas by its successful foreign policy. The test of German domestic\r\nstatesmanship hereafter will consist in its ability to win the support\r\nof the industrial democracy, created by the industrial advance of the\r\ncountry, without impairing the traditional and the existing practice of\r\nexpert and responsible leadership. The task is one of extreme\r\ndifficulty, but it is far from being wholly impossible, because the\r\nSocial Democratic party in Germany is every year becoming less\r\nrevolutionary and more national in its outlook. But at present little\r\nattempt is being made at conciliation; and the attitude of the ruling\r\nclasses is such that in the near future none is likely to be made. In\r\nthis respect they are false to the logic of the origin of German\r\npolitical unity. The union was accomplished with the assistance of the\r\ndemocracy and on a foundation of universal suffrage. As Germany has\r\nbecome more of a nation, the democracy has acquired more substantial\r\npower; but its increase in numbers and weight has not been accompanied\r\nby any increase of official recognition. The political organization of\r\nGermany is consequently losing touch with those who represent one\r\nessential aspect of the national growth. It behooves the ruling classes\r\nto tread warily, or they may have to face a domestic opposition more\r\ndangerous than any probable foreign opposition.\r\n\r\nThe situation is complicated by the dubious international standing of\r\nthe German Empire. She is partly surrounded by actual and possible\r\nenemies, against whom she can make headway only by means of continuous\r\nvigilance and efficient leadership; while at the same time her own\r\nnational ambitions still conflict in some measure with the interests of\r\nher neighbors. Her official foreign policy since 1872 has undoubtedly\r\nbeen determined by the desire to maintain the peace of Europe under\r\neffective guarantees, because she needed time to consolidate her\r\nposition and reap the advantages of her increasing industrial\r\nefficiency; but both German and European statesmen are none the less\r\nvery conscious of the fact that the German Empire is the European Power\r\nwhich has most to gain in Europe from a successful war. Some Frenchmen\r\nstill cherish plans of revenge for 1870; but candid French opinion is\r\nbeginning to admit that the constantly increasing resources of Germany\r\nin men and money make any deliberate policy of that kind almost\r\nsuicidal. France would lose much more by a defeat than she could gain\r\nfrom a victory, and the fruits of victory could not be permanently held.\r\nItaly, also, has no unsatisfied ambition which a war could gratify,\r\nexcept the addition of a few thousand Austrian-Italians to her\r\npopulation. Russia still looks longingly toward Constantinople; but\r\nuntil she has done something to solve her domestic problem and\r\nreorganize her finances, she needs peace rather than war. But the past\r\nsuccesses of Germany and her new and increasing expansive power tempt\r\nher to cherish ambitions which constitute the chief menace to the\r\ninternational stability of Europe. She would have much to lose, but she\r\nwould also have something to gain from the possible disintegration of\r\nAustria-Hungary. She has possibly still more to gain from the\r\nincorporation of Holland within the Empire. Her increasing commerce has\r\npossessed her with the idea of eventually disputing the supremacy of the\r\nsea with Great Britain. And she unquestionably expects to profit in Asia\r\nMinor from the possible break-up of the Ottoman Empire. How seriously\r\nsuch ambitions are entertained, it is difficult to say; and it is wholly\r\nimprobable that more than a small part of this enormous programme of\r\nnational aggrandizement will ever be realized. But when Germany has the\r\nchance of gaining and holding such advantages as these from a successful\r\nwar, it is no wonder that she remains the chief possible disturber of\r\nthe European peace. In her case certainly the fruits of victory look\r\nmore seductive than the penalties of defeat look dangerous; and the\r\nresolute opposition to the partial disarmament, which she has always\r\noffered at the Hague Conference, is the best evidence of the unsatisfied\r\nnature of her ambitions.\r\n\r\nGermany's standing in the European system is, then, very far from being\r\nas well-defined as are those of the older nations, like France and Great\r\nBritain. The gradual growth of a better understanding between France,\r\nGreat Britain, and Russia is largely due to an instinctive coalition of\r\nthose powers who would be most injured by an increase of the German\r\ninfluence and dominion; and the sense that Europe is becoming united\r\nagainst them makes German statesmen more than ever on their guard and\r\nmore than ever impatient of an embarrassing domestic opposition. Thus\r\nGermany's aggressive foreign policy has so far tended to increase the\r\ndistance between her responsible leaders and the popular party; and\r\nthere are only two ways in which this schism can be healed. If German\r\nforeign policy should continue to be as brilliantly successful as it was\r\nin the days of Bismarck, the authorities will have no difficulty in\r\nretaining the support of a sufficient majority of the German\r\npeople--just as the victory over Austria brought King William and\r\nBismarck forgiveness from their parliamentary opponents. On the other\r\nhand, any severe setback to Germany in the realization of its aggressive\r\nplans would strengthen the domestic opposition and might lead to a\r\nsevere internal crisis. It all depends upon whether German national\r\npolicy has or has not overstepped the limits of practical and permanent\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMILITARISM AND NATIONALITY\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations in respect to the existing international\r\nsituation of Germany bring me to another and final aspect of the\r\nrelation in Europe between nationality and democracy. One of the most\r\ndifficult and (be it admitted) one of the most dubious problems raised\r\nby any attempt to establish a constructive relationship between those\r\ntwo principles hangs on the fact that hitherto national development has\r\nnot apparently made for international peace. The nations of Europe are\r\nto all appearances as belligerent as were the former European dynastic\r\nstates. Europe has become a vast camp, and its governments are spending\r\nprobably a larger proportion of the resources of their countries for\r\nmilitary and naval purposes than did those of the eighteenth century.\r\nHow can these warlike preparations, in which all the European nations\r\nshare, and the warlike spirit which they have occasionally displayed, be\r\nreconciled with the existence of any constructive relationship between\r\nthe national and the democratic ideas?\r\n\r\nThe question can best be answered by briefly reviewing the claims\r\nalready advanced on behalf of the national principle. I have asserted\r\nfrom the start that the national principle was wholly different in\r\norigin and somewhat different in meaning from the principle of\r\ndemocracy. What has been claimed for nationality is, not that it can be\r\nidentified with democracy, but that as a political principle it remained\r\nunsatisfied without an infusion of democracy. But the extent to which\r\nthis infusion can go and the forms which it takes are determined by a\r\nlogic and a necessity very different from that of an absolute democratic\r\ntheory. National politics have from the start aimed primarily at\r\nefficiency--that is, at the successful use of the force resident in the\r\nstate to accomplish the purposes desired by the Sovereign authority.\r\nAmong the group of states inhabited by Christian peoples it has\r\ngradually been discovered that the efficient use of force is contingent\r\nin a number of respects upon its responsible use; and that its\r\nresponsible use means a limited policy of external aggrandizement and a\r\npartial distribution of political power and responsibilities. A national\r\npolity, however, always remains an organization based upon force. In\r\ninternal affairs it depends at bottom for its success not merely upon\r\npublic opinion, but, if necessary, upon the strong arm. It is a matter\r\nof government and coercion as well as a matter of influence and\r\npersuasion. So in its external relations its standing and success have\r\ndepended, and still depend, upon the efficient use of force, just in so\r\nfar as force is demanded by its own situation and the attitudes of its\r\nneighbors and rivals. The democrats who disparage efficient national\r\norganization are at bottom merely seeking to exorcise the power of\r\nphysical force in human affairs by the use of pious incantations and\r\nheavenly words. That they will never do. The Christian warrior must\r\naccompany the evangelist; and Christians are not by any means angels. It\r\nis none the less true that the modern nations control the expenditure of\r\nmore force in a more responsible manner than have any preceding\r\npolitical organizations; and it is none the less true that a further\r\ndevelopment of the national principle will mean in the end the\r\nattachment of still stricter responsibilities to the use of force both\r\nin the internal and external policies of modern nations.\r\n\r\nWar may be and has been a useful and justifiable engine of national\r\npolicy. It is justifiable, moreover, not merely in such a case as our\r\nCivil War, in which a people fought for their own national integrity.\r\nIt was, I believe, justifiable, in the case of the two wars which\r\npreceded the formation of the modern German Empire. These wars may,\r\nindeed, be considered as decisive instances. Prussia did not drift into\r\nthem, as we drifted into the Civil War. They were deliberately provoked\r\nby Bismarck at a favorable moment, because they were necessary to the\r\nunification of the German people under Prussian leadership; and I do not\r\nhesitate to say that he can be justified in the assumption of this\r\nenormous responsibility. The German national organization means\r\nincreased security, happiness, and opportunity of development for the\r\nwhole German people; and inasmuch as the selfish interests of Austria\r\nand France blocked the path, Bismarck had his sufficient warrant for a\r\ndeliberately planned attack. No doubt such an attack and its results\r\ninjured France and the French people just as it has benefited Germany;\r\nbut France had to suffer that injury as a penalty for the part she had\r\nas a matter of policy played in German affairs. For centuries a united\r\nFrance had helped to maintain for her own purposes a divided Germany;\r\nand when Germany herself became united, it was inevitable, as Bismarck\r\nforesaw in 1848, that French opposition must be forcibly removed, and\r\nsome of the fruits of French aggression be reclaimed. That the\r\nrestitution demanded went further than was necessary, I fully believe;\r\nbut the partial abuse of victory does not diminish the legitimacy of the\r\nGerman aggression. A war waged for an excellent purpose contributes more\r\nto human amelioration than a merely artificial peace,--such as that\r\nestablished by the Holy Alliance. The unification of Germany and Italy\r\nhas not only helped to liberate the energies of both the German and the\r\nItalian people, but it has made the political divisions of Europe\r\nconform much more nearly to the lines within which the people of Europe\r\ncan loyally and fruitfully associate one with another. In fact, the\r\nwhole national movement, if it has increased the preparations for war,\r\nhas diminished in number of probable causes thereof; and it is only by\r\ndiminishing the number of causes whereby a nation has more to gain from\r\nvictory than it has to lose by defeat that war among the civilized\r\npowers can be gradually extinguished.\r\n\r\nAt the present time it is, as we have seen, the international situation\r\nand the national ambitions of Russia and Germany which constitute the\r\nchief threat to European peace. Germany's existing position in Europe\r\ndepends upon its alliance with Austria-Hungary. The Habsburg Empire is\r\nan incoherent and unstable state which is held together only by dynastic\r\nties and external pressure. The German, the Austrian, and the Hungarian\r\ninterests all demand the perpetuation of the Habsburg dominion; but it\r\nis doubtful whether in the long run its large Slavic population will not\r\ncombine with its blood neighbors to break the bond. But whether the\r\nGerman, Austrian, and Hungarian interest does or does not prevail, the\r\nfundamental national interests, which are compromised by the precarious\r\nstability of Austria-Hungary, are alone sufficient to make disarmament\r\nimpossible. Disarmament means the preservation of Europe in its existing\r\ncondition; and such a policy, enforced by means of international\r\nguarantees, would be almost as inimical to the foundation of a permanent\r\nand satisfactory international system now as it was in 1820. The fact\r\nhas to be recognized that the ultimate object of a peaceable and stable\r\nEuropean international situation cannot in all probability be reached\r\nwithout many additional wars; and the essential point is that these\r\nwars, when they come, should, like the wars between Austria or France\r\nand Prussia, or like our Civil War, be fought to accomplish a desirable\r\npurpose and should be decisive in result.\r\n\r\nModern conflicts between efficiently organized nations tend to obtain\r\njust this character. They are fought for a defensible purpose, and they\r\naccomplish a definite result. The penalties of defeat are so disastrous\r\nthat warfare is no longer wantonly incurred; and it will not be provoked\r\nat all by nations, such as Italy or France, who have less to gain from\r\nvictory than they have to lose from defeat. Moreover, the cost of\r\nexisting armaments is so crushing that an ever increasing motive exists\r\nin favor of their ultimate reduction. This motive will not operate as\r\nlong as the leading Powers continue to have unsatisfied ambitions which\r\nlook practicable; but eventually it will necessarily have its effect.\r\nEach war, as it occurs, even if it does not finally settle some\r\nconflicting claims, will most assuredly help to teach the warring\r\nnations just how far they can go, and will help, consequently, to\r\nrestrict its subsequent policy within practicable and probably\r\ninoffensive limits. It is by no means an accident that England and\r\nFrance, the two oldest European nations, are the two whose foreign\r\npolicies are best defined and, so far as Europe is concerned, least\r\noffensive. For centuries these Powers fought and fought, because one of\r\nthem had aggressive designs which apparently or really affected the\r\nwelfare of the other; but the result of this prolonged rivalry has been\r\na constantly clearer understanding of their respective national\r\ninterests. Clear-headed and moderate statesmen like Talleyrand\r\nrecognized immediately after the Revolution that the substantial\r\ninterests of a liberalized France in Europe were closely akin to those\r\nof Great Britain, and again and again in the nineteenth century this\r\nprophecy was justified. Again and again the two Powers were brought\r\ntogether by their interests only to be again divided by a tradition of\r\nantagonism and misunderstanding. At present, however, they are probably\r\non better terms than ever before in the history of their relations; and\r\nthis result is due to the definite and necessarily unaggressive\r\ncharacter of their European interests. They have finally learned the\r\nlimits of their possible achievement and could transgress them only by\r\nsome act of folly.\r\n\r\nIn the course of another fifty years the limits of possible aggression\r\nby Germany and Russia in Europe will probably be very much better\r\ndefined than they are to-day. These two Powers will seek at the\r\nfavorable moment to accomplish certain aggressive purposes which they\r\nsecretly or openly entertain, and they will succeed or fail. Each\r\nsuccess or failure will probably be decisive in certain respects, and\r\nwill remove one or more existing conflicts of interest or ambiguities of\r\nposition. Whether this progressive specification of the practicable\r\nforeign policies of the several Powers will soon or will ever go so far\r\nas to make some general international understanding possible, is a\r\nquestion which no man can answer; but as long as the national principle\r\nretains its vitality, there is no other way of reaching a permanent and\r\nfruitful international settlement. That any one nation, or any small\r\ngroup of nations, can impose its dominion upon Europe is contrary to\r\nevery lesson of European history. Such a purpose would be immeasurably\r\nbeyond the power even of 90,000,000 Germans or 150,000,000 Russians, or\r\neven beyond the power of 90,000,000 Germans allied with 150,000,000\r\nRussians. Europe is capable of combining more effectually than ever\r\nbefore to resist any possible revival of imperialism; and the time will\r\ncome when Europe, threatened by the aggression of any one domineering\r\nPower, can call other continents to her assistance. The limits to the\r\npossible expansion of any one nation are established by certain\r\nfundamental and venerable political conditions. The penalties of\r\npersistent transgression would be not merely a sentence of piracy\r\nsimilar to that passed on Napoleon I, but a constantly diminishing\r\nnational vitality on the part of the aggressor. As long as the national\r\nprinciple endures, political power cannot be exercised irresponsibly\r\nwithout becoming inefficient and sterile.\r\n\r\nInimical as the national principle is to the carrying out either of a\r\nvisionary or a predatory foreign policy in Europe, it does not imply any\r\nsimilar hostility to a certain measure of colonial expansion. In this,\r\nas in many other important respects, the constructive national democrat\r\nmust necessarily differ from the old school of democratic \"liberals.\" A\r\nnationalized democracy is not based on abstract individual rights, no\r\nmatter whether the individual lives in Colorado, Paris, or Calcutta. Its\r\nconsistency is chiefly a matter of actual historical association in the\r\nmidst of a general Christian community of nations. A people that lack\r\nthe power of basing their political association on an accumulated\r\nnational tradition and purpose is not capable either of nationality or\r\ndemocracy; and that is the condition of the majority of Asiatic and\r\nAfrican peoples. A European nation can undertake the responsibility of\r\ngoverning these politically disorganized societies without any necessary\r\ndanger to its own national life. Such a task need not be beyond its\r\nphysical power, because disorganized peoples have a comparatively small\r\npower of resistance, and a few thousand resolute Europeans can hold in\r\nsubmission many million Asiatics. Neither does it conflict with the\r\nmoral basis of a national political organization, because at least for a\r\nwhile the Asiatic population may well be benefited by more orderly and\r\nprogressive government. Submission to such a government is necessary as\r\na condition of subsequent political development. The majority of Asiatic\r\nand African communities can only got a fair start politically by some\r\nsuch preliminary process of tutelage; and the assumption by a European\r\nnation of such a responsibility in a desirable phase of national\r\ndiscipline and a frequent source of genuine national advance.\r\n\r\nNeither does an aggressive colonial policy make for unnecessary or\r\nmeaningless wars. It is true, of course, that colonial expansion\r\nincreases the number of possible occasions for dispute among the\r\nexpanding nations; but these disputes have the advantage of rarely\r\nturning on questions really vital to the future prosperity of a European\r\nnation. They are just the sort of international differences of interest\r\nwhich ought to be settled by arbitration or conciliation, because both\r\nof the disputants have so much more to lose by hostilities than they\r\nhave to gain by military success. A dispute turning upon a piece of\r\nAfrican territory would, if it waxed into war, involve the most awful\r\nand dangerous consequences in Europe. The danger of European wars,\r\nexcept for national purposes of prime importance, carries its\r\nconsequence into Africa and Asia. France, for instance, was very much\r\nirritated by the continued English occupation of Egypt in spite of\r\ncertain solemn promises of evacuation; and the expedition of Marchand,\r\nwhich ended in the Fashoda incident, indirectly questioned the validity\r\nof the British occupation of Egypt by making that occupation\r\nstrategically insecure. In spite, however, of the deliberate manner in\r\nwhich France raised this question and of the highly irritated condition\r\nof French public opinion, she could not, when the choice had to be made,\r\nafford the consequences of a Franco-English war. In the end she was\r\nobliged to seek compensation elsewhere in Africa and abandon her\r\noccupation of Fashoda. This incident is typical; and it points directly\r\nto the conclusion that wars will very rarely occur among European\r\nnations over disputes as to colonies, unless the political situation in\r\nEurope is one which itself makes war desirable or inevitable. A Bismarck\r\ncould handle a Fashoda incident so as to provoke hostilities, but in\r\nthat case Fashoda, like the Hohenzollern candidacy in Spain, would be a\r\npretext, not a cause. The one contemporary instance in which a\r\ndifference of colonial interests has caused a great war is the recent\r\nconflict between Russia and Japan; and in this instance the issues\r\nraised by the dispute were essentially different from the issues raised\r\nby a dispute over a colonial question between two European nations. The\r\nconflict of interests turned upon matter essential to the future\r\nprosperity of Japan, while at the same time the war did not necessarily\r\ninvolve dangerous European complications.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that colonial expansion by modern national states is to be\r\nregarded, not as a cause of war, but as a safety-valve against war. It\r\naffords an arena in which the restless and adventurous members of a\r\nnational body can have their fling without dangerous consequences, while\r\nat the same time it satisfies the desire of a people for some evidence\r\nof and opportunity for national expansion. The nations which, one after\r\nanother, have recognized the limits of their expansion in Europe have\r\nbeen those which have adopted a more or less explicit policy of colonial\r\nacquisition. Spain was, indeed, a great colonial power at a time when\r\nher policy in Europe continued to be aggressive; but her European\r\naggressions soon undermined her national vitality, and her decadence in\r\nEurope brought her colonial expansion to a standstill. Portugal and\r\nHolland were too small to cherish visions of European aggrandizement,\r\nand they naturally sought an outlet in Asia and Africa for their\r\nenergies. After Great Britain had passed through her revolutionary\r\nperiod, she made rapid advances as a colonial power, because she\r\nrealized that her insular situation rendered a merely defensive European\r\npolicy obligatory. France made a failure of her American and Asiatic\r\ncolonies as long as she cherished schemes of European aggrandizement.\r\nHer period of colonial expansion, Algeria apart, did not come until\r\nafter the Franco-Prussian War and the death of her ambition for a Rhine\r\nfrontier. Bismarck was opposed to colonial development because he\r\nbelieved that Germany should husband her strength for the preservation\r\nand the improvement of her standing in Europe; but Germany's power of\r\nexpansion demanded some outlet during a period of European rest.\r\nThroughout the reign of the present Emperor she has been picking up\r\ncolonies wherever she could in Asia and Africa; and she cherishes\r\ncertain plans for the extension of German influence in Asia Minor. It is\r\ncharacteristic of the ambiguous international position of Germany that\r\nshe alone among the European Powers (except the peculiar case of Russia)\r\nis expectant of an increase of power both in Europe and other\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nIn the long run Germany will, like France, discover that under existing\r\nconditions an aggressive colonial and aggressive European policy are\r\nincompatible. The more important her colonies become and the larger her\r\noceanic commerce, the more Germany lays herself open to injury from a\r\nstrong maritime power, and the more hostages she is giving for good\r\nbehavior in Europe. Unless a nation controls the sea, colonies are from\r\na military point of view a source of weakness. The colonizing nation is\r\nin the position of a merchant who increases his business by means of a\r\nconsiderable increase of his debts. His use of the borrowed capital may\r\nbe profitable, but none the less he makes his standing at the time of an\r\nemergency much more precarious. In the same way colonies add to the\r\nresponsibilities of a nation and scatter its military resources; and a\r\nnation placed in such a situation is much less likely to break the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe economic and political development of Asia and Africa by the\r\nEuropean Powers is in its infancy; and no certain predictions can be\r\nmade as to its final effects upon the political relations among\r\ncivilized nations. Many important questions in respect thereto remain\r\nambiguous. What, for instance, are the limits of a practicable policy of\r\ncolonial expansion? In view of her peculiar economic condition and her\r\nthreatened decrease in population have those limits been transgressed by\r\nFrance? Have they been transgressed by Great Britain? Considering the\r\nenormous increase in British responsibilities imposed by the maritime\r\nexpansion of Germany, will not Great Britain be obliged to adopt a\r\npolicy of concentration rather than expansion? Is not her partial\r\nretirement from American waters the first step in such a policy? Is not\r\nthe Japanese alliance a dubious device for the partial shifting of\r\nburdens too heavy to bear? How long can Great Britain afford to maintain\r\nher existing control of the sea? Is there any way of ending such a\r\ncontrol save either by the absolute exhaustion of Great Britain or by\r\nthe establishment of a stable international system under adequate\r\nguarantees? Will the economic development of Asia lead to the awakening\r\nof other Asiatic states like Japan, and the re-arrangement of\r\ninternational relations for the purpose of giving them their appropriate\r\nplaces? A multitude of such questions are raised by the transformation\r\nwhich is taking place from a European international system into a\r\npolitical system composed chiefly of European nations, but embracing the\r\nwhole world; and these questions will prove to be sufficiently difficult\r\nof solution. But in spite of the certainty that colonial expansion will\r\nin the end merely transfer to a larger area the conflicts of idea and\r\ninterest whose effects have hitherto chiefly been confined to Europe--in\r\nspite of this certainty the process of colonial expansion is a wholly\r\nlegitimate aspect of national development, and is not necessarily\r\ninimical to the advance of democracy. It will not make immediately for a\r\npermanent international settlement; but it is accomplishing a work\r\nwithout which a permanent international settlement is impossible; and it\r\nindubitably places every colonizing nation in a situation which makes\r\nthe risk of hostilities dangerous compared to the possible advantages of\r\nmilitary success.\r\n\r\nThe chief object of this long digression, has, I hope, now been\r\nachieved. My purpose has been to exhibit the European nations as a group\r\nof historic individuals with purposes, opportunities, and limitations\r\nanalogous to those of actual individuals. An individual has no meaning\r\napart from the society in which his individuality has been formed. A\r\nnational state is capable of development only in relation to the society\r\nof more or less nationalized states in the midst of which its history\r\nhas been unfolded. The growing and maturing individual is he who comes\r\nto take a more definite and serviceable position in his surrounding\r\nsociety,--he who performs excellently a special work adapted to his\r\nabilities. The maturing nation is in the same way the nation which is\r\ncapable of limiting itself to the performance of a practicable and\r\nuseful national work,--a work which in some specific respect accelerates\r\nthe march of Christian civilization. There is no way in which a higher\r\ntype of national life can be obtained without a corresponding individual\r\nimprovement on the part of its constituent members. There is similarly\r\nno way in which a permanently satisfactory system of international\r\nrelations can be secured, save by the increasing historical experience\r\nand effective self-control of related nations. Any country which\r\ndeclares that it is too good (or too democratic) to associate with other\r\nnations and share the responsibilities and opportunities resulting from\r\nsuch association is comparable to the individual who declares himself to\r\nbe too saintly for association with his fellow-countrymen. Whatever a\r\nman or a nation gains by isolation, he or it necessarily loses in the\r\ndiscipline of experience with its possible fruits of wisdom and\r\nself-control. Association is a condition of individuality. International\r\nrelations are a condition of nationality. A universal nation is as much\r\na contradiction in terms as a universal individual. A nation seeking to\r\ndestroy other nations is analogous to a man who seeks to destroy the\r\nsociety in which he was born. Little by little European history has been\r\nteaching this lesson; and in the course of time the correlation of\r\nnational development with the improvement and definition of\r\ninternational relations will probably be embodied in some set of\r\ninternational institutions.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the existing rivalries and enmities among European\r\nstates must not be under-estimated either in their significance or their\r\nstrength. In a way those rivalries have become more intense than ever\r\nbefore; and it is only too apparent that the many-headed rulers of\r\nmodern nations are as capable of cherishing personal and national\r\ndislikes as were the sovereign kings of other centuries. These rivalries\r\nand enmities will not be dissolved by kind words and noble sentiments.\r\nThe federation of Europe, like the unification of Germany, will never be\r\nbrought about by congresses and amicable resolutions. It can be effected\r\nonly by the same old means of blood and iron. The nations will never\r\nagree upon a permanent settlement until they have more to gain from\r\npeace than from military victory. But such a time will be postponed all\r\nthe longer unless the nations, like France, Italy, England and the\r\nUnited States, which are at present sincerely desirous of peace, keep as\r\nwell armed as their more belligerent neighbors. When the tug comes, the\r\nissue will depend upon the effective force which such nations, when\r\nloyally combined, can exert. It would be fatal, consequently, for the\r\npacific Powers to seek to establish peace by a partial diminution of\r\ntheir military efficiency. Such an action would merely encourage the\r\nbelligerent Powers to push their aggressive plans to the limit. The\r\nformer must, on the contrary, keep as well armed as their resources and\r\npolicy demand. Nationality is impaired and the national principle is\r\nviolated just as soon as a nation neglects any sort of efficiency which\r\nis required either by its international position or by its national\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND ITS NATIONAL PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\nThe foregoing review of the relation which has come to subsist in Europe\r\nbetween nationality and democracy should help us to understand the\r\npeculiar bond which unites the American democratic and national\r\nprinciples. The net result of that review was encouraging but not\r\ndecisive. As a consequence of their development as nations, the European\r\npeoples have been unable to get along without a certain infusion of\r\ndemocracy; but it was for the most part essential to their national\r\ninterest that such an infusion should be strictly limited. In Europe the\r\ntwo ideals have never been allowed a frank and unconstrained relation\r\none to the other other. They have been unable to live apart; but their\r\nmarriage has usually been one of convenience, which was very far from\r\nimplying complete mutual dependence and confidence. No doubt the\r\ncollective interests of the German or British people suffer because such\r\na lack of dependence and confidence exists; but their collective\r\ninterests would suffer more from a sudden or violent attempt to destroy\r\nthe barriers. The nature and the history of the different democratic and\r\nnational movements in the several European countries at once tie them\r\ntogether and keep them apart.\r\n\r\nThe peoples of Europe can only escape gradually from the large infusion\r\nof arbitrary and irrational material in their national composition.\r\nMonarchical and aristocratic traditions and a certain measure of\r\npolitical and social privilege have remained an essential part of their\r\nnational lives; and no less essential was an element of defiance in\r\ntheir attitude toward their European neighbors. Hence, when the\r\nprinciple of national Sovereignty was proclaimed as a substitute for the\r\nprincipal of royal Sovereignty, that principle really did not mean the\r\nsudden bestowal upon the people of unlimited Sovereign power. \"The true\r\npeople,\" said Bismarck, in 1847, then a country squire, \"is an invisible\r\nmultitude of spirits. It is the living nation--the nation organized for\r\nits historical mission--the nation of yesterday and of to-morrow.\" A\r\nnation, that is, is a people in so far as they are united by traditions\r\nand purposes; and national Sovereignty implies an attachment to national\r\nhistory and traditions which permits only the very gradual alteration of\r\nthese traditions in the direction of increasing democracy. The mistake\r\nwhich France made at the time of the French Revolution was precisely\r\nthat of interpreting the phrase \"souvreneté nationale\" as equivalent to\r\nimmediate, complete, and (in respect to the past) irresponsible popular\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe European nations are, consequently, not in a position to make their\r\nnational ideals frankly and loyally democratic. Their national integrity\r\ndepends upon fidelity to traditional ideas and forms quite as much as it\r\ndoes upon the gradual modification of those ideas and forms in a\r\ndemocratic direction. The orderly unfolding of their national lives\r\ncalls for a series of compromises which carry the fundamental democratic\r\nimplication of the national principle as far as it can under the\r\ncircumstances be safely carried; and in no other way does a people\r\nexhibit its political common sense so clearly as in its ability to be\r\ncontemporary and progressive without breaking away from its historical\r\nanchorage. A comparatively definite national mission and purpose clearly\r\nemerge at some particular phase of the indefinite process of internal\r\nand external readjustment; but such a mission and such purposes\r\nnecessarily possess a limited significance and a special character.\r\nRestricted as they are by the facts of national history, they lack the\r\nultimate moral significance of the democratic ideal, which permits the\r\ntransformation of patriotic fidelity into devotion to the highest and\r\nmost comprehensive interests of humanity and civilization.\r\n\r\nThat an analogous condition exists in our own country, it would be vain\r\nto deny. The American people possessed a collective character even\r\nbefore they possessed a national organization; and both before and after\r\nthe foundation of a national government, these common traditions were by\r\nno means wholly democratic. Furthermore, as we have frequently had\r\noccasion to observe, the American democracy in its traditional form has\r\nmore often than not been anti-national in instinct and idea. Our own\r\ncountry has, consequently, a problem to solve, similar in certain\r\nrespects to that of the European nations. Its national cohesion is a\r\nmatter of historical association, and the facts of its historical\r\nassociation have resulted in a partial division and a misunderstanding\r\nbetween its two fundamental principles--the principles of nationality\r\nand democracy.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the United States there is, however, to be observed an\r\nessential difference. A nation, and particularly a European nation,\r\ncannot afford to become too complete a democracy all at once, because it\r\nwould thereby be uprooting traditions upon which its national cohesion\r\ndepends. But there is no reason why a democracy cannot trust its\r\ninterests absolutely to the care of the national interest, and there is\r\nin particular every reason why the American democracy should become in\r\nsentiment and conviction frankly, unscrupulously, and loyally\r\nnationalist. This, of course, is a heresy from the point of view of the\r\nAmerican democratic tradition; but it is much less of a heresy from the\r\npoint of view of American political practice, and, whether heretical or\r\nnot, it indicates the road whereby alone the American people can obtain\r\npolitical salvation.\r\n\r\nThe American democracy can trust its interest to the national interest,\r\nbecause American national cohesion is dependent, not only upon certain\r\nforms of historical association, but upon fidelity to a democratic\r\nprinciple. A nation is a very complex political, social, and economic\r\nproduct--so complex that political thinkers in emphasizing one aspect of\r\nit are apt to forget other and equally essential aspects. Its habits and\r\ntraditions of historical association constitute an indispensable bond;\r\nbut they do not constitute the only bond. A specific national character\r\nis more than a group of traditions and institutions. It tends to be a\r\nformative idea, which defines the situation of a country in reference to\r\nits neighbors, and which is constantly seeking a better articulation and\r\nunderstanding among the various parts of its domestic life. The English\r\nnational idea is chiefly a matter of freedom, but the principle of\r\nfreedom is associated with a certain in measure of responsibility. The\r\nGerman national idea is more difficult of precise description, but it\r\nturns upon the principle of efficient and expert official leadership\r\ntoward what is as yet a hazy goal of national greatness. The French\r\nnational idea is democratic, but its democracy is rendered difficult by\r\nFrench national insecurity, and its value is limited by its equalitarian\r\nbias. The French, like the American, democracy needs above all to be\r\nthoroughly nationalized; and a condition of such a result is the loyal\r\nadoption of democracy as the national idea. Both French and American\r\nnational cohesion depend upon the fidelity of the national organization\r\nto the democratic idea, and the gradual but intentional transformation\r\nof the substance of the national life in obedience to a democratic\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nLet us seek for this complicated formula a specific application. How can\r\nit be translated into terms of contemporary American conditions? Well,\r\nin the first place, Americans are tied together by certain political,\r\nsocial, and economic habits, institutions, and traditions. From the\r\npolitical point of view these forms of association are at once\r\nconstitutional, Federal, and democratic. They are accustomed to some\r\nmeasure of political centralization, to a larger measure of local\r\ngovernmental responsibility, to a still larger measure of individual\r\neconomic freedom. This group of political institutions and habits has\r\nbeen gradually pieced together under the influence of varying political\r\nideas and conditions. It contains many contradictory ingredients, and\r\nnot a few that are positively dangerous to the public health. Such as it\r\nis, however, the American people are attached to this national\r\ntradition; and no part of it could be suddenly or violently transformed\r\nor mutilated without wounding large and important classes among the\r\nAmerican people, both in their interests and feelings. They have been\r\naccustomed to associate under certain conditions and on certain terms;\r\nand to alter in any important way those conditions and terms of\r\nassociation without fair notice, full discussion, a demonstrable need\r\nand a sufficient consent of public opinion, would be to drive a wedge\r\ninto the substance of American national cohesion. The American nation,\r\nno matter how much (or how little) it may be devoted to democratic\r\npolitical and social ideas, cannot uproot any essential element in its\r\nnational tradition without severe penalties--as the American people\r\ndiscovered when they decided to cut negro slavery out of their national\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, their national health and consistency were in the\r\nlong run very much benefited by the surgical operation of the Civil War;\r\nand it was benefited because the War eradicated the most flagrant\r\nexisting contradiction among the various parts of the American national\r\ntradition. This instance sufficiently showed, consequently, that\r\nalthough nationality has its traditional basis, it is far from being\r\nmerely a conservative principle. At any one time the current of national\r\npublic opinion embodies a temporary accommodation among the different\r\ntraditional ideas, interests, conditions, and institutions. This balance\r\nof varying and perhaps conflicting elements is constantly being\r\ndestroyed by new conditions,--such, for instance, as the gradual\r\nincrease before the Civil War of the North as compared to the South in\r\nwealth, population, and industrial efficiency. The effect of this\r\ndestruction of the traditional balance was to bring out the\r\ncontradiction between the institution of negro slavery and the American\r\ndemocratic purpose--thereby necessitating an active conflict, and the\r\ntriumph of one of these principles over the other. The unionist\r\ndemocracy conquered, and as the result of that conquest a new balance\r\nwas reached between the various ingredients of American national life.\r\nDuring the past generation, the increased efficiency of organization in\r\nbusiness and politics, the enormous growth of an irresponsible\r\nindividual money-power, the much more definite division of the American\r\npeople into possibly antagonistic classes, and the pressing practical\r\nneed for expert, responsible, and authoritative leadership,--these new\r\nconditions and demands have been by way of upsetting once more the\r\ntraditional national balance and of driving new wedges into American\r\nnational cohesion. New contradictions have been developed between\r\nvarious aspects of the American national composition; and if the\r\nAmerican people wish to escape the necessity of regaining their health\r\nby means of another surgical operation, they must consider carefully how\r\nmuch of a reorganization of traditional institutions, policy, and ideas\r\nare necessary for the achievement of a new and more stable national\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nIn the case of our own country, however, a balance is not to be struck\r\nmerely by the process of compromise in the interest of harmony. Our\r\nforbears tried that method in dealing with the slavery problem from\r\n1820 to 1850, and we all know with what results. American national\r\ncohesion is a matter of national integrity; and national integrity is a\r\nmatter of loyalty to the requirements of a democratic ideal. For better\r\nor worse the American people have proclaimed themselves to be a\r\ndemocracy, and they have proclaimed that democracy means popular\r\neconomic, social, and moral emancipation. The only way to regain their\r\nnational balance is to remove those obstacles which the economic\r\ndevelopment of the country has placed in the path of a better democratic\r\nfulfillment. The economic and social changes of the past generation have\r\nbrought out a serious and a glaring contradiction between the demands of\r\na constructive democratic ideal and the machinery of methods and\r\ninstitutions, which have been considered sufficient for its realization.\r\nThis is the fundamental discrepancy which must be at least partially\r\neradicated before American national integrity can be triumphantly\r\nre-affirmed. The cohesion, which is a condition of effective\r\nnationality, is endangered by such a contradiction, and as long as it\r\nexists the different elements composing American society will be pulling\r\napart rather than together. The national principle becomes a principle\r\nof reform and reconstruction, precisely because national consistency is\r\nconstantly demanding the solution of contradictory economic and\r\npolitical tendencies, brought out by alterations in the conditions of\r\neconomic and political efficiency. Its function is not only to preserve\r\na balance among these diverse tendencies, but to make that balance more\r\nthan ever expressive of a consistent and constructive democratic ideal.\r\nAny disloyalty to democracy on the part of American national policy\r\nwould in the end prove fatal to American national unity.\r\n\r\nThe American democracy can, consequently, safely trust its genuine\r\ninterests to the keeping of those who represent the national interest.\r\nIt both can do so, and it must do so. Only by faith in an efficient\r\nnational organization and by an exclusive and aggressive devotion to the\r\nnational welfare, can the American democratic ideal be made good. If the\r\nAmerican local commonwealths had not been wrought by the Federalists\r\ninto the form of a nation, they would never have continued to be\r\ndemocracies; and the people collectively have become more of a democracy\r\nin proportion as they have become more of a nation. Their democracy is\r\nto be realized by means of an intensification of their national life,\r\njust as the ultimate moral purpose of an individual is to be realized by\r\nthe affirmation and intensification of its own better individuality.\r\nConsequently the organization of the American democracy into a nation is\r\nnot to be regarded in the way that so many Americans have regarded\r\nit,--as a necessary but hazardous surrender of certain liberties in\r\norder that other liberties might be better preserved,--as a mere\r\ncompromise between the democratic ideal and the necessary conditions of\r\npolitical cohesion and efficiency. Its nationalized political\r\norganization constitutes the proper structure and veritable life of the\r\nAmerican democracy. No doubt the existing organization is far from being\r\na wholly adequate expression of the demands of the democratic ideal, but\r\nit falls equally short of being an adequate expression of the demands of\r\nthe national ideal. The less confidence the American people have in a\r\nnational organization, the less they are willing to surrender themselves\r\nto the national spirit, the worse democrats they will be. The most\r\nstubborn impediments which block the American national advance issue\r\nfrom the imperfections in our democracy. The American people are not\r\nprepared for a higher form of democracy, because they are not prepared\r\nfor a more coherent and intense national life. When they are prepared to\r\nbe consistent, constructive, and aspiring democrats, their preparation\r\nwill necessarily take the form of becoming consistent, constructive, and\r\naspiring nationalists.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty raised by European political and economic development\r\nhangs chiefly on a necessary loyalty to a national tradition and\r\norganization which blocks the advance of democracy. Americans cannot\r\nentirely escape this difficulty; but in our country by far the greater\r\nobstacle to social amelioration is constituted by a democratic theory\r\nand tradition, which blocks the process of national development. We\r\nAmericans are confronted by two divergent theories of democracy.\r\nAccording to one of these theories, the interest of American democracy\r\ncan be advanced only by an increasing nationalization of the American\r\npeople in ideas, in institutions, and in spirit. According to the other\r\nof these theories, the most effective way of injuring the interest of\r\ndemocracy is by an increase in national authority and a spread of the\r\nnational leaven. Thus Americans, unlike Englishmen, have to choose, not\r\nbetween a specific and efficient national tradition and a vague and\r\nperilous democratic ideal--they have to choose between two democratic\r\nideals, and they have to make this choice chiefly on logical and moral\r\ngrounds. An Englishman or a German, no matter how clear his intelligence\r\nor fervid his patriotism, cannot find any immediately and entirely\r\nsatisfactory method of reconciling the national traditions and forms of\r\norganization with the demands of an uncompromising democracy. An\r\nAmerican, on the other hand, has it quite within his power to accept a\r\nconception of democracy which provides for the substantial integrity of\r\nhis country, not only as a nation with an exclusively democratic\r\nmission, but as a democracy with an essentially national career.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNATIONALITY AND CENTRALIZATION\r\n\r\nThe Federal political organization has always tended to confuse to the\r\nAmerican mind the relation between democracy and nationality. The nation\r\nas a legal body was, of course, created by the Constitution, which\r\ngranted to the central government certain specific powers and\r\nresponsibilities, and which almost to the same extent diminished the\r\npowers and the responsibilities of the separate states. Consequently, to\r\nthe great majority of Americans, the process of increasing\r\nnationalization has a tendency to mean merely an increase in the\r\nfunctions of the central government. For the same reason the affirmation\r\nof a constructive relation between the national and the democratic\r\nprinciples is likely to be interpreted merely as an attempt on the\r\ngrounds of an abstract theory to limit state government and to disparage\r\nstates rights. Such an interpretation, however, would be essentially\r\nerroneous. It would be based upon the very idea against which I have\r\nbeen continually protesting--the idea that the American nation, instead\r\nof embodying a living formative political principle, is merely the\r\npolitical system created by the Federal Constitution; and it would end\r\nin the absurd conclusion that the only way in which the Promise of\r\nAmerican democracy can be fulfilled would be by the abolition of\r\nAmerican local political institutions.\r\n\r\nThe nationalizing of American political, economic, and social life means\r\nsomething more than Federal centralization and something very different\r\ntherefrom. To nationalize a people has never meant merely to centralize\r\ntheir government. Little by little a thoroughly national political\r\norganization has come to mean in Europe an organization which combined\r\neffective authority with certain responsibilities to the people; but the\r\nnational interest has been just as likely to demand de-centralization as\r\nit has to demand centralization. The Prussia of Frederick the Great, for\r\ninstance, was over-centralized; and the restoration of the national\r\nvitality, at which the Prussian government aimed after the disasters of\r\n1806, necessarily took the form of reinvigorating the local members of\r\nthe national body. In this and many similar instances the national\r\ninterest and welfare was the end, and a greater or smaller amount of\r\ncentralized government merely the necessary machinery. The process of\r\ncentralization is not, like the process of nationalization, an\r\nessentially formative and enlightening political transformation. When a\r\npeople are being nationalized, their political, economic, and social\r\norganization or policy is being coördinated with their actual needs and\r\ntheir moral and political ideals. Governmental centralization is to be\r\nregarded as one of the many means which may or may not be taken in order\r\nto effect this purpose. Like every other special aspect of the national\r\norganization, it must be justified by its fruits. There is no\r\npresumption in its favor. Neither is there any general presumption\r\nagainst it. Whether a given function should or should not be exercised\r\nby the central government in a Federal system is from the point of view\r\nof political logic a matter of expediency--with the burden of proof\r\nresting on those who propose to alter any existing Constitutional\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nIt may be affirmed, consequently, without paradox, that among those\r\nbranches of the American national organization which are greatly in need\r\nof nationalizing is the central government. Almost every member of the\r\nAmerican political body has been at one time or another or in one way or\r\nanother perverted to the service of special interests. The state\r\ngovernments and the municipal administrations have sinned more in this\r\nrespect than the central government; but the central government itself\r\nhas been a grave sinner. The Federal authorities are responsible for the\r\nprevailing policy in respect to military pensions, which is one of the\r\nmost flagrant crimes ever perpetrated against the national interest. The\r\nFederal authorities, again, are responsible for the existing tariff\r\nschedules, which benefit a group of special interests at the expense of\r\nthe national welfare. The Federal authorities, finally, are responsible\r\nfor the Sherman Anti-Trust Law, whose existence on the statute books is\r\na fatal bar to the treatment of the problem of corporate aggrandizement\r\nfrom the standpoint of genuinely national policy. Those instances might\r\nbe multiplied, but they suffice to show that the ideal of a constructive\r\nrelation between the American national and democratic principles does\r\nnot imply that any particular piece of legislation or policy is national\r\nbecause it is Federal. The Federal no less than the state governments\r\nhas been the victim of special interests; and when a group of state or\r\ncity officials effectively assert the public interest against the\r\nprivate interests, either of the machine or of the local corporations,\r\nthey are noting just as palpably, if not just as comprehensively, for\r\nthe national welfare, as if their work benefited the whole American\r\npeople. The process of nationalization in its application to American\r\npolitical organization means that political power shall be distributed\r\namong the central, state, and municipal officials in such a manner that\r\nit can be efficiently and responsibly exerted in the interest of those\r\naffected by its action.\r\n\r\nBe it added, however, in the same breath, that under existing conditions\r\nand simply as a matter of expediency, the national advance of the\r\nAmerican democracy does demand an increasing amount of centralized\r\naction and responsibility. In what respect and for what purposes an\r\nincreased Federal power and responsibility is desirable will be\r\nconsidered in a subsequent chapter. In this connection it is sufficient\r\nto insist that a more scrupulous attention to existing Federal\r\nresponsibilities, and the increase of their number and scope, is the\r\nnatural consequence of the increasing concentration of American\r\nindustrial, political, and social life. American government demands more\r\nrather than less centralization merely and precisely because of the\r\ngrowing centralization of American activity. The state governments,\r\neither individually or by any practicable methods of coöperation, are\r\nnot competent to deal effectively in the national interest and spirit\r\nwith the grave problems created by the aggrandizement of corporate and\r\nindividual wealth and the increasing classification of the American\r\npeople. They have, no doubt, an essential part to play in the attempted\r\nsolution of these problems; and there are certain aspects of the whole\r\nsituation which the American nation, because of its Federal\r\norganization, can deal with much more effectually than can a rigidly\r\ncentralized democracy like France. But the amount of responsibility in\r\nrespect to fundamental national problems, which, in law almost as much\r\nas in practice, is left to the states, exceeds the responsibility which\r\nthe state governments are capable of efficiently redeeming. They are\r\nattempting (or neglecting) a task which they cannot be expected to\r\nperform with any efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the states fail properly to perform certain essential\r\nfunctions such as maintaining order or administering justice, is no\r\nsufficient reason for depriving them thereof. Functions which should be\r\nbestowed upon the central government are not those which the states\r\nhappen to perform badly. They are those which the states, even with the\r\nbest will in the world, cannot be expected to perform satisfactorily;\r\nand among these functions the regulation of commerce, the organization\r\nof labor, and the increasing control over property in the public\r\ninterest are assuredly to be included. The best friends of local\r\ngovernment in this country are those who seek to have its activity\r\nconfined with the limits of possible efficiency, because only in case\r\nits activity is so confined can the states continue to remain an\r\nessential part of a really efficient and well-coördinated national\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nProposals to increase the powers of the central government are, however,\r\nrarely treated on their merits. They are opposed by the majority of\r\nAmerican politicians and newspapers as an unqualified evil. Any attempt\r\nto prove that the existing distribution of responsibility is necessarily\r\nfruitful of economic and political abuses, and that an increase of\r\ncentralized power offers the only chance of eradicating these abuses is\r\ntreated as irrelevant. It is not a question of the expediency of a\r\nspecific proposal, because from the traditional point of view any\r\nchange in the direction of increased centralization would be a violation\r\nof American democracy. Centralization is merely a necessary evil which\r\nhas been carried as far as it should, and which cannot be carried any\r\nfurther without undermining the foundations of the American system. Thus\r\nthe familiar theory of many excellent American democrats is rather that\r\nof a contradictory than a constructive relation between the democratic\r\nand the national ideals. The process of nationalization is perverted by\r\nthem into a matter merely of centralization, but the question of the\r\nfundamental relation between nationality and democracy is raised by\r\ntheir attitude, because the reasons they advance against increasingly\r\ncentralized authority would, if they should continue to prevail,\r\ndefinitely and absolutely forbid a gradually improving coördination\r\nbetween American political organization and American national economic\r\nneeds or moral and intellectual ideals. The conception of democracy out\r\nof which the supposed contradiction between the democratic and national\r\nideals issues is the great enemy of the American national advance, and\r\nis for that reason the great enemy of the real interests of democracy.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, any increase in centralized power and responsibility,\r\nexpedient or inexpedient, is injurious to certain aspects of traditional\r\nAmerican democracy. But the fault in that case lies with the democratic\r\ntradition; and the erroneous and misleading tradition must yield before\r\nthe march of a constructive national democracy. The national advance\r\nwill always be impeded by these misleading and erroneous ideas, and,\r\nwhat is more, it always should be impeded by them, because at bottom\r\nideas of this kind are merely an expression of the fact that the average\r\nAmerican individual is morally and intellectually inadequate to a\r\nserious and consistent conception of his responsibilities as a democrat.\r\nAn American national democracy must always prove its right to a further\r\nadvance, not only by the development of a policy and method adequate for\r\nthe particular occasion, but by its ability to overcome the inevitable\r\nopposition of selfish interests and erroneous ideas. The logic of its\r\nposition makes it the aggressor, just as the logic of its opponents'\r\nposition ties them to a negative and protesting or merely insubordinate\r\npart. If the latter should prevail, their victory would become\r\ntantamount to national dissolution, either by putrefaction, by\r\nrevolution, or by both.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of certain practical demands, an increase has\r\nalready taken place in the activity of the Federal government. The\r\nincrease has not gone as far as governmental efficiency demands, but it\r\nhas gone far enough to provoke outbursts of protest and anguish from the\r\n\"old-fashioned Democrats.\" They profess to see the approaching\r\nextinction of the American democracy in what they call the drift towards\r\ncentralization. Such calamitous predictions are natural, but they are\r\nnone the less absurd. The drift of American politics--its instinctive\r\nand unguided movement--is almost wholly along the habitual road; and any\r\neffective increase of Federal centralization can be imposed only by most\r\nstrenuous efforts, by one of the biggest sticks which has ever been\r\nflourished in American politics. The advance made in this direction is\r\nsmall compared to the actual needs of an efficient national\r\norganization, and considering the mass of interest and prejudice which\r\nit must continue to overcome, it can hardly continue to progress at more\r\nthan a snail's pace. The great obstacle to American national fulfillment\r\nmust always be the danger that the American people will merely succumb\r\nto the demands of their local and private interests and will permit\r\ntheir political craft to drift into a compromising situation--from which\r\nthe penalties of rescue may be almost as distressing as the penalties of\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of an individualist and provincial democracy, which is the\r\nmainstay of an anti-national policy, does not include ideals which have\r\nto be realized by aggressive action. Their ideals are the ones embodied\r\nin our existing system, and their continued vitality demands merely a\r\npolicy of inaction enveloped in a cloud of sacred phrases. The advocates\r\nand the beneficiaries of the prevailing ideas and conditions are little\r\nby little being forced into the inevitable attitude of the traditional\r\nBourbon--the attitude of maintaining customary or legal rights merely\r\nbecause they are customary or legal, and predicting the most awful\r\nconsequences from any attempt to impair them. Men, or associations of\r\nmen, who possess legal or customary rights inimical to the public\r\nwelfare, always defend those rights as the essential part of a political\r\nsystem, which, if it is overthrown, will prove destructive to public\r\nprosperity and security. On no other ground can they find a plausible\r\npublic excuse for their opposition. The French royal authority and\r\naristocratic privileges were defended on these grounds in 1780, and as\r\nthe event proved, with some show of reason. In the same way the partial\r\nlegislative control of nationalized corporations now exercised by the\r\nstate government, is defended, not on the ground that it has been well\r\nexercised, not even plausibly on the ground that it can be well\r\nexercised. It is defended almost exclusively on the ground that any\r\nincrease in the authority of the Federal government is dangerous to the\r\nAmerican people. But the Federal government belongs to the American\r\npeople even more completely than do the state governments, because a\r\ngeneral current of public opinion can act much more effectively on the\r\nsingle Federal authority than it can upon the many separate state\r\nauthorities. Popular interests have nothing to fear from a measure of\r\nFederal centralization, which bestows on the Federal government powers\r\nnecessary to the fulfillment of its legitimate responsibilities; and the\r\nAmerican people cannot in the long run be deceived by pleas which bear\r\nthe evidence of such a selfish origin and have such dubious historical\r\nassociations. The rights and the powers both of states and individuals\r\nmust be competent to serve their purposes efficiently in an economical\r\nand coherent national organization, or else they must be superseded. A\r\nprejudice against centralization is as pernicious, provided\r\ncentralization is necessary, as a prejudice in its favor. All rights\r\nunder the law are functions in a democratic political organism and must\r\nbe justified by their actual or presumable functional adequacy.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of a constructive relation between American nationality and\r\nAmerican democracy is in truth equivalent to a new Declaration of\r\nIndependence. It affirms that the American people are free to organize\r\ntheir political, economic, and social life in the service of a\r\ncomprehensive, a lofty, and far-reaching democratic purpose. At the\r\npresent time there is a strong, almost a dominant tendency to regard the\r\nexisting Constitution with superstitious awe, and to shrink with horror\r\nfrom modifying it even in the smallest detail; and it is this\r\nsuperstitious fear of changing the most trivial parts of the fundamental\r\nlegal fabric which brings to pass the great bondage of the American\r\nspirit. If such an abject worship of legal precedent for its own sake\r\nshould continue, the American idea will have to be fitted to the rigid\r\nand narrow lines of a few legal formulas; and the ruler of the American\r\nspirit, like the ruler of the Jewish spirit of old, will become the\r\nlawyer. But it will not continue, in case Americans can be brought to\r\nunderstand and believe that the American national political organization\r\nshould be constructively related to their democratic purpose. Such an\r\nideal reveals at once the real opportunity and the real responsibility\r\nof the American democracy. It declares that the democracy has a\r\nmachinery in a nationalized organization, and a practical guide in the\r\nnational interest, which are adequate to the realization of the\r\ndemocratic ideal; and it declares also that in the long run just in so\r\nfar as Americans timidly or superstitiously refuse to accept their\r\nnational opportunity and responsibility, they will not deserve the names\r\neither of freemen or of loyal democrats. There comes a time in the\r\nhistory of every nation, when its independence of spirit vanishes,\r\nunless it emancipates itself in some measure from its traditional\r\nillusions; and that time is fast approaching for the American people.\r\nThey must either seize the chance of a better future, or else become a\r\nnation which is satisfied in spirit merely to repeat indefinitely the\r\nmonotonous measures of its own past.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE AND THE NATION\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this discussion popular Sovereignty was declared to\r\nbe the essential condition of democracy; and a general account of the\r\nnature of a constructive democratic ideal can best be brought to a close\r\nby a definition of the meaning of the phrase, popular Sovereignty,\r\nconsistent with a nationalist interpretation of democracy. The people\r\nare Sovereign; but who and what are the people? and how can a\r\nmany-headed Sovereignty be made to work? Are we to answer, like\r\nBismarck, that the \"true people is an invisible multitude of\r\nspirits--the nation of yesterday and of to-morrow\"? Such an answer seems\r\nscarcely fair to living people of to-day. On the other hand, can we\r\nreply that the Sovereign people is constituted by any chance majority\r\nwhich happens to obtain control of the government, and that the\r\ndecisions and actions of the majority are inevitably and unexceptionally\r\ndemocratic? Such an assertion of the doctrine of popular Sovereignty\r\nwould bestow absolute Sovereign authority on merely a part of the\r\npeople. Majority rule, under certain prescribed conditions, is a\r\nnecessary constituent of any practicable democratic organization; but\r\nthe actions or decisions of a majority need not have any binding moral\r\nand national authority. Majority rule is merely one means to an\r\nextremely difficult, remote and complicated end; and it is a piece of\r\nmachinery which is peculiarly liable to get out of order. Its arbitrary\r\nand dangerous tendencies can, as a matter of fact, be checked in many\r\neffectual and legitimate ways, of which the most effectual is the\r\ncherishing of a tradition, partly expressed in some body of fundamental\r\nlaw, that the true people are, as Bismarck declared, in some measure an\r\ninvisible multitude of spirits--the nation of yesterday and to-morrow,\r\norganized for its national historical mission.\r\n\r\nThe phrase popular Sovereignty is, consequently, for us Americans\r\nequivalent to the phrase \"national Sovereignty.\" The people are not\r\nSovereign as individuals. They are not Sovereign in reason and morals\r\neven when united into a majority. They become Sovereign only in so far\r\nas they succeed in reaching and expressing a collective purpose. But\r\nthere is no royal and unimpeachable road to the attainment of such a\r\ncollective will; and the best means a democratic people can take in\r\norder to assert its Sovereign authority with full moral effect is to\r\nseek fullness and consistency of national life. They are Sovereign in so\r\nfar as they are united in spirit and in purpose; and they are united in\r\nso far as they are loyal one to another, to their joint past, and to the\r\nPromise of their future. The Promise of their future may sometimes\r\ndemand the partial renunciation of their past and the partial sacrifice\r\nof certain present interests; but the inevitable friction of all such\r\nsacrifices can be mitigated by mutual loyalty and good faith. Sacrifices\r\nof tradition and interest can only be demanded in case they contribute\r\nto the national purpose--to the gradual creation of a higher type of\r\nindividual and associated life. Hence it is that an effective increase\r\nin national coherence looks in the direction of the democratic\r\nconsummation--of the morally and intellectually authoritative expression\r\nof the Sovereign popular will. Both the forging and the functioning of\r\nsuch a will are constructively related to the gradual achievement of the\r\nwork of individual and social amelioration.\r\n\r\nUndesirable and inadequate forms of democracy always seek to dispense in\r\none way or another with this tedious process of achieving a morally\r\nauthoritative Sovereign will. We Americans have identified democracy\r\nwith certain existing political and civil rights, and we have,\r\nconsequently, tended to believe that the democratic consummation was\r\nmerely a matter of exercising and preserving those rights. The grossest\r\nform of this error was perpetrated when Stephen A. Douglas confused\r\nauthoritative popular Sovereignty with the majority vote of a few\r\nhundred \"squatters\" in a frontier state, and asserted that on democratic\r\nprinciples such expressions of the popular will should be accepted as\r\nfinal. But an analogous mistake lurks in all static forms of democracy.\r\nThe bestowal and the exercise of political and civil rights are merely a\r\nmethod of organization, which if used in proper subordination to the\r\nultimate democratic purpose, may achieve in action something of the\r\nauthority of a popular Sovereign will. But to cleave to the details of\r\nsuch an organization as the very essence of democracy is utterly to\r\npervert the principle of national democratic Sovereignty. From this\r\npoint of view, the Bourbon who wishes the existing system with its\r\nmal-adaptations and contradictions preserved in all its lack of\r\nintegrity, commits an error analogous to that of the radical, who wishes\r\nby virtue of a majority vote immediately to destroy some essential part\r\nof the fabric. Both of them conceive that the whole moral and national\r\nauthority of the democratic principle can be invoked in favor of\r\ninstitutions already in existence or of purposes capable of immediate\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are democrats who would seek a consummate\r\ndemocracy without the use of any political machinery. The idea that a\r\nhigher type of associated life can be immediately realized by a supreme\r\nact of faith must always be tempting to men who unite social aspirations\r\nwith deep religious faith. It is a more worthy and profound conception\r\nof democracy than the conventional American one of a system of legally\r\nconstituted and equally exercised rights, fatally resulting in material\r\nprosperity. Before any great stride can be made towards a condition of\r\nbetter democracy, the constructive democratic movement must obtain more\r\neffective support both from scientific discipline and religious faith.\r\nNevertheless, the triumph of Tolstoyan democracy at the present moment\r\nwould be more pernicious in its results than the triumph of Jeffersonian\r\nDemocracy. Tolstoy has merely given a fresh and exalted version of the\r\nold doctrine of non-resistance, which, as it was proclaimed by Jesus,\r\nreferred in the most literal way to another world. In this world faith\r\ncannot dispense with power and organization. The sudden and immediate\r\nconversion of unregenerate men from a condition of violence,\r\nselfishness, and sin into a condition of beatitude and brotherly love\r\ncan obtain even comparative permanence only by virtue of exclusiveness.\r\nThe religious experience of our race has sufficiently testified to the\r\npermanence of the law. One man can be evangelized for a lifetime. A\r\ngroup of men can be evangelized for many years. Multitudes of men can be\r\nevangelized only for a few hours. No faith can achieve comparatively\r\nstable social conquests without being established by habit, defined by\r\nthought, and consolidated by organization. Usually the faith itself\r\nsubsequently sickens of the bad air it breathes in its own house.\r\nIndeed, it is certain to lose initiative and vigor, unless it can appeal\r\nintermittently to some correlative source of enthusiasm and devotion.\r\nBut with the help of efficient organization it may possibly survive,\r\nwhereas in the absence of such a worldly body, it must in a worldly\r\nsense inevitably perish. Democracy as a living movement in the direction\r\nof human brotherhood has required, like other faiths, an efficient\r\norganization and a root in ordinary human nature; and it obtains such an\r\norganization by virtue of the process of national development--on\r\ncondition, of course, that the nation is free to become a genuine and\r\nthorough-going democracy.\r\n\r\nA democracy organized into a nation, and imbued with the national\r\nspirit, will seek by means of experimentation and discipline to reach\r\nthe object which Tolstoy would reach by an immediate and a miraculous\r\nact of faith. The exigencies of such schooling frequently demand severe\r\ncoercive measures, but what schooling does not? A nation cannot merely\r\ndischarge its unregenerate citizens; and the best men in a nation or in\r\nany political society cannot evade the responsibility which the fact of\r\nhuman unregeneracy places upon the whole group. After men had reached a\r\ncertain stage of civilization, they frequently began to fear that the\r\nrough conditions of political association excluded the highest and most\r\nfruitful forms of social life; and they sought various ways of improving\r\nthe quality of the association by narrowing its basis. They tried to\r\nfound small communities of saints who were connected exclusively by\r\nmoral and religious bonds, and who in this way freed themselves from the\r\nhazards, the distraction, and the violence inseparable from political\r\nassociation. Such communities have made at different times great\r\nsuccesses; but their success has not been permanent. The political\r\naspect of associated life is not to be evaded. In proportion as\r\npolitical organization gained in prosperity, efficiency, and dignity,\r\nspecial religious associations lost their independence and power. Even\r\nthe most powerful religious association in the world, the Catholic\r\nChurch, has been fighting a losing battle with political authority, and\r\nit is likely in the course of time to occupy in relation to the\r\npolitical powers a position analogous to that of the Greek or the\r\nEnglish church. The ultimate power to command must rest with that\r\nauthority which, if necessary, can force people to obey; and any plan of\r\nassociation which seeks to ignore the part which physical force plays in\r\nlife is necessarily incomplete. Just as formerly the irresponsible and\r\nmeaningless use of political power created the need of special religious\r\nassociations, independent of the state, so now the responsible, the\r\npurposeful, and the efficient use of physical force, characteristic of\r\nmodern nations, has in its turn made such independence less necessary,\r\nand tends to attach a different function to the church. A basis of\r\nassociation narrower than the whole complex of human powers and\r\ninterests will not serve. National organization provides such a basis.\r\nThe perversity of human nature may cause its ultimate failure; but it\r\nwill not fail because it omits any essential constituent in the\r\ncomposition of a permanent and fruitful human association. So far as it\r\nfulfills its responsibilities, it guarantees protection against\r\npredatory powers at home and abroad. It provides in appropriate measure\r\nfor individual freedom, for physical, moral, and intellectual\r\ndiscipline, and for social consistency. It has prizes to offer as well\r\nas coercion to exercise; and with its foundations planted firmly in the\r\npast, its windows and portals look out towards a better future. The\r\ntendency of its normal action is continually, if very slowly, to\r\ndiminish the distance between the ideal of human brotherhood, and the\r\npolitical, economic, and social conditions, under which at any one time\r\nmen manage to live together.\r\n\r\nThat is the truth to which the patriotic Americans should firmly cleave.\r\nThe modern nation, particularly in so far as it is constructively\r\ndemocratic, constitutes the best machinery as yet developed for raising\r\nthe level of human association. It really teaches men how they must\r\nfeel, what they must think, and what they must do, in order that they\r\nmay live together amicably and profitably. The value of this school for\r\nits present purposes is increased by its very imperfections, because its\r\nimperfections issue inevitably from the imperfections of human nature.\r\nMen being as unregenerate as they are, all worthy human endeavor\r\ninvolves consequences of battle and risk. The heroes of the struggle\r\nmust maintain their achievements and at times even promote their objects\r\nby compulsion. The policeman and the soldier will continue for an\r\nindefinite period to be guardians of the national schools, and the\r\nnations have no reason to be ashamed of this fact. It is merely symbolic\r\nof the very comprehensiveness of their responsibilities--that they have\r\nto deal with the problem of human inadequacy and unregeneracy in all its\r\nforms,--that they cannot evade this problem by allowing only the good\r\nboys to attend school--that they cannot even mitigate it by drawing too\r\nsharp a distinction between the good boys and the bad. Such\r\nindiscriminate attendance in these national schools, if it is to be\r\nedifying, involves one practical consequence of dominant importance.\r\nEverybody within the school-house--masters, teachers, pupils and\r\njanitors, old pupils and young, good pupils and bad, must feel one to\r\nanother an indestructible loyalty. Such loyalty is merely the subjective\r\naspect of their inevitable mutual association; it is merely the\r\nrecognition that as a worldly body they must all live or die and conquer\r\nor fail together. The existence of an invincible loyalty is a condition\r\nof the perpetuity of the school. The man who believes himself wise is\r\nalways tempted to ignore or undervalue the foolish brethren. The man who\r\nbelieves himself good is always tempted actively to dislike the perverse\r\nbrethren. The man who insists at any cost upon having his own way is\r\nalways twisting the brethren into his friends or his enemies. But the\r\nteaching of the national school constantly tends to diminish these\r\ncauses of disloyalty. Its tendency is to convert traditional patriotism\r\ninto a patient devotion to the national ideal, and into a patient\r\nloyalty towards one's fellow-countrymen as the visible and inevitable\r\nsubstance through which that ideal is to be expressed.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing characteristic of a democratic nation, we reach the\r\ndecisive difference between a nation which is seeking to be wholly\r\ndemocratic and a nation which is content to be semi-democratic. In the\r\nsemi-democratic nation devotion to the national ideal does not to the\r\nsame extent sanctify the citizen's relation in feeling and in idea to\r\nhis fellow-countrymen. The loyalty demanded by the national ideal of\r\nsuch a country may imply a partly disloyal and suspicious attitude\r\ntowards large numbers of political associates. The popular and the\r\nnational interests must necessarily in some measure diverge. In a\r\nnationalized democracy or a democratic nation the corresponding dilemma\r\nis mitigated. The popular interest can only be efficiently expressed in\r\na national policy and organization. The national interest is merely a\r\nmore coherent and ameliorating expression of the popular interest. Its\r\nconsistency, so far as it is consistent, is the reflection of a more\r\nhumanized condition of human nature. It increases with the increasing\r\npower of its citizens to deal fairly and to feel loyally towards their\r\nfellow-countrymen; and it cannot increase except through the overthrow\r\nof the obstacles to fair dealing and loyal feeling.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility and loyalty which the citizens of a democratic nation\r\nmust feel one towards another is comprehensive and unmitigable; but the\r\nactual behavior which at any one time the national welfare demands must,\r\nof course, be specially and carefully discriminated. National policies\r\nand acts will be welcome to some citizens and obnoxious to others,\r\naccording to their special interests and opinions; and the citizens\r\nwhose interests and ideas are prejudiced thereby have every right and\r\nshould be permitted every opportunity to protest in the most vigorous\r\nand persistent manner. The nation may, however, on its part demand that\r\nthese protests, in order to be heeded and respected, must conform to\r\ncertain conditions. They must not be carried to the point of refusing\r\nobedience to the law. When private interests are injured by the national\r\npolicy, the protestants must be able to show either that such injuries\r\nare unnecessary, or else they involve harm to an essential public\r\ninterest. All such protest must find an ultimate sanction in a group of\r\nconstructive democratic ideas. Finally, the protest must never be made\r\nthe excuse for personal injustice or national disloyalty. Even if the\r\nnational policy should betray indifference to the fundamental interests\r\nof a democratic nation, as did that of the United States from 1820 to\r\n1860, the obligation of patient good faith on the part of the\r\nprotestants is not diminished. Their protests may be as vivacious and as\r\npersistent as the error demands. The supporters of the erroneous policy\r\nmay be made the object of most drastic criticism and the uncompromising\r\nexposure. No effort should be spared to secure the adoption of a more\r\ngenuinely national policy. But beyond all this there remains a still\r\ndeeper responsibility--that of dealing towards one's fellow-countrymen\r\nin good faith, so that differences of interest, of conviction, and of\r\nmoral purpose can be made the agency of a better understanding and a\r\nfirmer loyalty.\r\n\r\nIf a national policy offends the integrity of the national idea, as for\r\na while that of the American nation did, its mistake is sure to involve\r\ncertain disastrous consequences; and those consequences constitute,\r\nusually, the vehicle of necessary national discipline. The national\r\nschool is, of course, the national life. So far as the school is\r\nproperly conducted, the methods of instruction are, if you please,\r\npedagogic; but if the masters are blind or negligent, or if the scholars\r\nare unruly, there remains as a resource the more painful and costly\r\nmethods of nature's instruction. A serious error will be followed by its\r\ninevitable penalty, proportioned to the blindness and the perversity in\r\nwhich it originated; and thereafter the prosperity of the country's\r\nfuture will hang partly on the ability of the national intelligence to\r\ntrace the penalty to its cause and to fix the responsibility. No matter\r\nhow loyal the different members of a national body may be one to\r\nanother, their mutual good faith will bleed to death, unless some among\r\nthem have the intelligence to trace their national ills to their\r\nappropriate causes, and the candid courage to advocate the necessary\r\nremedial measures. At some point in the process, disinterested\r\npatriotism and good faith must be reënforced by intellectual insight. A\r\npeople are saved many costly perversions, in case the official\r\nschool-masters are wise, and the pupils neither truant nor\r\ninsubordinate; but if the lessons are foolishly phrased, or the pupils\r\nrefuse to learn, the school will never regain its proper disciplinary\r\nvalue until new teachers have arisen, who understand both the error and\r\nits consequences, and who can exercise an effective authority over their\r\npupils.\r\n\r\nThe mutual loyalty and responsibility, consequently, embodied and\r\ninculcated in a national school, depends for its efficient expression\r\nupon the amount of insight and intelligence which it involves. The\r\nprocess of national education means, not only a discipline of the\r\npopular will, but training in ability to draw inferences from the\r\nnational experience, so that the national consciousness will gradually\r\nacquire an edifying state of mind towards its present and its future\r\nproblems. Those problems are always closely allied to the problems which\r\nhave been more or less completely solved during the national history;\r\nand the body of practical lessons which can be inferred from that\r\nhistory is the best possible preparation for present and future\r\nemergencies. Such history requires close and exact reading. The national\r\nexperience is always strangely mixed. Even the successes of our own\r\npast, such as the Federal organization, contain much dubious matter,\r\ndemanding the most scrupulous disentanglement. Even the worst enemies of\r\nour national integrity, such as the Southern planters, offer in some\r\nrespects an edifying political example to a disinterested democracy.\r\nNations do not have to make serious mistakes in order to learn valuable\r\nlessons. Every national action, no matter how trivial, which is\r\nscrutinized with candor, may contribute to the stock of national\r\nintellectual discipline--the result of which should be to form a\r\nconstantly more coherent whole out of the several elements in the\r\nnational composition--out of the social and economic conditions, the\r\nstock of national opinions, and the essential national ideal. And it is\r\nthis essential national ideal which makes it undesirable for the\r\nnational consciousness to dwell too much on the past or to depend too\r\nmuch upon the lessons of experience alone. The great experience given to\r\na democratic nation must be just an incorrigible but patient attempt to\r\nrealize its democratic ideal--an attempt which must mold history as well\r\nas hang upon its lessons. The function of the patriotic political\r\nintelligence in relation to the fulfillment of the national Promise must\r\nbe to devise means for its redemption--means which have their relations\r\nto the past, their suitability to the occasion, and their contribution\r\ntowards a step in advance. The work in both critical, experienced, and\r\npurposeful. Mistakes will be made, and their effects either corrected or\r\nturned to good account. Successes will be achieved, and their effects\r\nmust be coolly appraised and carefully discriminated. The task will\r\nnever be entirely achieved, but the tedious and laborious advance will\r\nfor every generation be a triumphant affirmation of the nationalized\r\ndemocratic ideal as the one really adequate political and social\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\nThe logic of a national democratic ideal and the responsibilities of a\r\nnational career in the world involve a number of very definite\r\nconsequences in respect to American foreign policy. They involve, in\r\nfact, a conception of the place of a democratic nation in relation to\r\nthe other civilized nations, different from that which has hitherto\r\nprevailed in this country. Because of their geographical situation and\r\ntheir democratic institutions, Americans have claimed and still claim a\r\nlarge degree of national aloofness and independence; but such a claim\r\ncould have been better defended several generations ago than it can\r\nto-day. Unquestionably the geographical situation of the United States\r\nmust always have a decisive effect upon the nature of its policy in\r\nforeign affairs; and undoubtedly no course of action in respect to other\r\nnations can be national without serving the interests of democracy. But\r\nprecisely because an American foreign policy must be candidly and\r\nvigorously national, it will gradually bring with it an increasingly\r\ncomplicated group of international ties and duties. The American nation,\r\njust in so far as it believes in its nationality and is ready to become\r\nmore of a nation, must assume a more definite and a more responsible\r\nplace in the international system. It will have an increasingly\r\nimportant and an increasingly specific part to play in the political\r\naffairs of the world; and, in spite of \"old-fashioned democratic\"\r\nscruples and prejudices, the will to play that part for all it is worth\r\nwill constitute a beneficial and a necessary stimulus to the better\r\nrealization of the Promise of our domestic life.\r\n\r\nA genuinely national policy must, of course, be based upon a correct\r\nunderstanding of the national interest in relation to those of its\r\nneighbors and associates. That American policy did obtain such a\r\nfoundation during the early years of American history is to be traced to\r\nthe sound political judgment of Washington and Hamilton. Jefferson and\r\nthe Republicans did their best for a while to persuade the American\r\ndemocracy to follow the dangerous course of the French democracy, and to\r\nbase its international policy not upon the firm ground of national\r\ninterest, but on the treacherous sands of international democratic\r\npropagandism. After a period of hesitation, the American people, with\r\ntheir usual good sense in the face of a practical emergency, rallied to\r\nthe principles subsequently contained in Washington's Farewell Address;\r\nand the Jeffersonian Republicans, when they came into control of the\r\nFederal government, took over this conception of American national\r\npolicy together with the rest of the Federalist outfit. But like the\r\nrest of the Federalist organization and ideas, the national foreign\r\npolicy was emasculated by the expression it received at the hands of the\r\nRepublicans. The conduct of American foreign affairs during the first\r\nfifteen years of the century are an illustration of the ills which may\r\nbefall a democracy during a critical international period, when its\r\nforeign policy is managed by a party of anti-national patriots.\r\n\r\nAfter 1815 the foreign policy of the United States was determined by a\r\nstrict adherence to the principles enunciated in Washington's Farewell\r\nAddress. The adherence was more in the letter than in the spirit, and\r\nthe ordinary popular interpretation, which prevails until the present\r\nday, cannot be granted undivided approval; but so far as its immediate\r\nproblems were concerned, American foreign policy did not, on the whole,\r\ngo astray. The United States kept resolutely clear of European\r\nentanglements, and did not participate in international councils, except\r\nwhen the rights of neutrals were under discussion; and this persistent\r\nneutrality was precisely the course which was needed in order to confirm\r\nthe international position of the country as well as to leave the road\r\nclear for its own national development. But certain consequences were at\r\nan early date deduced from a neutral policy which require more careful\r\nexamination. During the presidency of Monroe the systematic isolation of\r\nthe United States in respect to Europe was developed, so far as the two\r\nAmericas were concerned, into a more positive doctrine. It was\r\nproclaimed that abstention on the part of the United States from\r\nEuropean affairs should be accompanied by a corresponding abstention by\r\nthe European Powers from aggressive action in the two Americas. What our\r\ngovernment proposed to do was to divide sharply the democratic political\r\nsystem of the Americas from the monarchical and aristocratic political\r\nsystem of Europe. The European system, based as it was upon royalist\r\nlegitimacy and privileges, and denying as it did popular political\r\nrights, was declared to be inimical in spirit and in effect to the\r\nAmerican democratic state.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine has been accepted in this form ever since as an\r\nindisputable corollary of the Farewell Address. The American people and\r\npoliticians cherish it as a priceless political heirloom. It is\r\nconsidered to be the equivalent of the Declaration of Independence in\r\nthe field of foreign affairs; and it arouses an analogous volume and\r\nfury of conviction. Neither is this conviction merely the property of\r\nFourth-of-July Americans. Our gravest publicists usually contribute to\r\nthe Doctrine a no less emphatic adherence; and not very many years ago\r\none of the most enlightened of American statesmen asserted that American\r\nforeign policy as a whole could be sufficiently summed up in the phrase,\r\n\"The Monroe Doctrine and the Golden Rule.\" Does the Monroe Doctrine, as\r\nstated above, deserve such uncompromising adherence? Is it an adequate\r\nexpression of the national interest of the American democracy in the\r\nfield of foreign affairs?\r\n\r\nAt the time the Monroe Doctrine was originally proclaimed, it did\r\nunquestionably express a valid national interest of the American\r\ndemocracy. It was the American retort to the policy of the Holy Alliance\r\nwhich sought to erect the counter-revolutionary principles into an\r\ninternational system, and which suppressed, so far as possible, all\r\nnationalist or democratic agitation. The Spanish-American colonies had\r\nbeen winning their independence from Spain; and there was a fear, not\r\nentirely ill-founded, that the Alliance would apply its anti-democratic\r\ninternational policy to the case of Spain's revolted colonies. Obviously\r\nthe United States, both as a democracy and as a democracy which had won\r\nits independence by means of a revolutionary war, could not admit the\r\nright of any combination of European states to suppress national and\r\ndemocratic uprisings on the American continents. Our government would\r\nhave been wholly justified in resisting such interference with all its\r\navailable military force. But in what sense and upon what grounds was\r\nthe United States justified in going farther than this, and in asserting\r\nthat under no circumstances should there be any increase of European\r\npolitical influence upon the American continents? What is the propriety\r\nand justice of such a declaration of continental isolation? What are its\r\nimplications? And what, if any, are its dangers?\r\n\r\nIn seeking an answer to these questions we must return to the source of\r\nAmerican foreign policy in the Farewell Address. That address contains\r\nthe germ of a prudent and wise American national policy; but Hamilton,\r\nin preparing its phrasing, was guided chiefly by a consideration of the\r\nimmediate needs and dangers of his country. The Jeffersonian Republicans\r\nin their enthusiasm for the French Revolution proposed for a while to\r\nbring about a permanent alliance between France and the United States,\r\nthe object whereof should be the propagation of the democratic political\r\nfaith. Both Washington and Hamilton saw clearly that such behavior would\r\nentangle the United States in all the vicissitudes and turmoil which\r\nmight attend the development of European democracy; and their favorite\r\npolicy of neutrality and isolation implied both that the national\r\ninterest of the United States was not concerned in merely European\r\ncomplications, and that the American people, unlike those of France, did\r\nnot propose to make their political principles an excuse for\r\ninternational aggression. The Monroe Doctrine, as proclaimed in 1825,\r\nrounded out this negative policy with a more positive assertion of\r\nprinciples. It declared that the neutrality of the American democracy,\r\nso far as Europe was concerned, must be balanced by the non-intervention\r\nof European legitimacy and aristocracy in the affairs of the American\r\ncontinents. Now this extension of American foreign policy was, as we\r\nhave seen, justified, in so far as it was a protest against any possible\r\ninterference on the part of the Holy Alliance in American politics. It\r\nwas, moreover, justified in so far as it sought to identify the\r\nattainment of a desirable democratic purpose with American international\r\npolicy. Of course Hamilton, when he tried to found the international\r\npolicy of his country upon the national interest, wholly failed to\r\nidentify that interest with any positive democratic purpose; but in\r\nthis, as in other respects, Hamilton was not a thorough-going democrat.\r\nWhile he was right in seeking to prevent the American people from\r\nallying themselves with the aggressive French democracy, he was wrong in\r\nfailing to foresee that the national interest of the United States was\r\nidentified with the general security and prosperity of liberal political\r\ninstitutions--that the United States must by every practical means\r\nencourage the spread of democratic methods and ideas. As much in foreign\r\nas in domestic affairs must the American people seek to unite national\r\nefficiency with democratic idealism. The Monroe Doctrine, consequently,\r\nis not to be condemned, as it has been condemned, merely because it went\r\nfar beyond the limited foreign policy of Hamilton. The real question in\r\nregard to the Doctrine is whether it seeks in a practicable way--in a\r\nway consistent with the national interest and inevitable international\r\nresponsibilities--the realization of the democratic idea. Do the rigid\r\nadvocates of that Doctrine fall into an error analogous to the error\r\nagainst which Washington and Hamilton were protesting? Do they not tend,\r\nindirectly, and within a limited compass, to convert the American\r\ndemocratic idea into a dangerously aggressive principle?\r\n\r\nThe foregoing question must, I believe, be answered partly in the\r\naffirmative. The Monroe Doctrine, as usually stated, does give a\r\ndangerously militant tendency to the foreign policy of the United\r\nStates; and unless its expression is modified, it may prevent the United\r\nStates from occupying a position towards the nations of Europe and\r\nAmerica in conformity with its national interest and its national\r\nprinciple. It should be added, however, that this unwholesomely\r\naggressive quality is only a tendency, which will not become active\r\nexcept under certain possible conditions, and which can gradually be\r\nrendered less dangerous by the systematic development of the Doctrine as\r\na positive principle of political action in the Western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine has, of course, no status in the accepted system of\r\nInternational Law. Its international standing is due almost entirely to\r\nits express proclamation as an essential part of the foreign policy of\r\nthe United States, and it depends for its weight upon the ability of\r\nthis country to compel its recognition by the use of latent or actual\r\nmilitary force. Great Britain has, perhaps, tacitly accepted it, but no\r\nother European country has done so, and a number of them have expressly\r\nstated that it entails consequences against which they might sometime be\r\nobliged strenuously and forcibly to protest. No forcible protest has as\r\nyet been made, because no European country has had anything to gain from\r\nsuch a protest, comparable to the inevitable cost of a war with the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe dangerously aggressive tendency of the Monroe Doctrine is not due to\r\nthe fact that it derives its standing from the effective military power\r\nof the United States. The recognition which any proclamation of a\r\nspecific principle of foreign policy receives will depend, in case it\r\nconflicts with the actual or possible interests of other nations, upon\r\nthe military and naval power with which it can be maintained. The\r\nquestion as to whether a particular doctrine is unwholesomely aggressive\r\ndepends, consequently, not upon the mere fact that it may provoke a war,\r\nbut upon the doubt that, if it provokes a war, such a war can be\r\nrighteously fought. Does the Doctrine as usually stated, possibly or\r\nprobably commit the United States to an unrighteous war--a war in which\r\nthe United States would be opposing a legitimate interest on the part of\r\none or a group of European nations? Does an American foreign policy of\r\nthe \"Monroe Doctrine and the Golden Rule\" proclaim two parallel springs\r\nof national action in foreign affairs which may prove to be\r\nincompatible?\r\n\r\nThere is a danger that such may be the case. The Monroe Doctrine in its\r\nmost popular form proclaims a rigid policy of continental isolation--of\r\nAmerica for the Americans and of Europe for the Europeans. European\r\nnations may retain existing possessions in the Americas, but such\r\npossessions must not be increased. So far, so good. A European nation,\r\nwhich sought defiantly to increase its American possessions, in spite of\r\nthe express declaration of the United States that such action would mean\r\nwar, would deserve the war thereby incurred. But there are many ways of\r\nincreasing the political influence of European Powers in the Americas\r\nwithout actual territorial appropriation. The emigration from several\r\nEuropean states and from Japan to South America is already\r\nconsiderable, and is likely to increase rather than diminish. European\r\ncommercial interests in South America are greater than ours, and in the\r\nfuture will become greater still. The South Americans have already\r\nborrowed large quantities of European capital, and will need more. The\r\nindustrial and agricultural development of the South American states is\r\nconstantly tying them more closely to Europe than it is to the United\r\nStates. It looks, consequently, as if irresistible economic conditions\r\nwere making in favor of an increase of effective European influence in\r\nSouth America. The growth of that influence is part of the\r\nworld-movement in the direction of the better utilization of the\r\neconomic resources of mankind. South America cannot develop without the\r\nbenefits of European capital, additional European labor, European\r\nproducts, and European experience and training; and in the course of\r\nanother few generations the result will be a European investment in\r\nSouth America, which may in a number of different ways involve political\r\ncomplications. We have already had a foretaste of those consequences in\r\nthe steps which the European Powers took a few years ago to collect\r\ndebts due to Europeans by Venezuela.\r\n\r\nThe increasing industrial, social, and financial bonds might not have\r\nany serious political consequences, provided the several South American\r\nstates were possessed of stable governments, orderly political\r\ntraditions, and a political standing under definite treaties similar to\r\nthat of the smaller European states. But such is not the case. The alien\r\ninvestment in South America may involve all sorts of political\r\ncomplications which would give European or Asiatic Powers a justifiable\r\nright under the law of nations to interfere. Up to the present time, as\r\nwe have seen, such interference has promised to be too costly; but the\r\ntime may well come when the advantages of interference will more than\r\ncounterbalance the dangers of a forcible protest. Moreover, in case such\r\na protest were made, it might not come from any single European Power. A\r\ngeneral European interest would be involved. The United States might\r\nwell find her policy of America for the Americans result in an attempt\r\non the part of a European coalition to bring about a really effectual\r\nisolation. We might find ourselves involved in a war against a\r\nsubstantially united Europe. Such a danger seems sufficiently remote at\r\npresent; but in the long run a policy which carries isolation too far is\r\nbound to provoke justifiable attempts to break it down. If Europe and\r\nthe Americas are as much divided in political interest as the Monroe\r\nDoctrine seems to assert, the time will inevitably arrive when the two\r\ndivergent political systems must meet and fight; and plenty of occasions\r\nfor such a conflict will arise, as soon as the policy of isolation\r\nbegins to conflict with the establishment of that political relation\r\nbetween Europe and South America demanded by fundamental economic and\r\nsocial interests. Thus under certain remote but entirely possible\r\nconditions, the Doctrine as now proclaimed and practiced might justify\r\nEurope in seeking to break it down by reasons at least as valid as those\r\nof our own country in proclaiming it.\r\n\r\nBut if the Monroe Doctrine could only be maintained by a war of this\r\nkind, or a succession of wars, it would defeat the very purpose which it\r\nis supposed to accomplish. It would embroil the United States and the\r\ntwo American continents in continual trouble with Europe; and it would\r\neither have to be abandoned or else would carry with it incessant and\r\nenormous expenditures for military and naval purposes. The United States\r\nwould have to become a predominantly military power, armed to the teeth,\r\nto resist or forestall European attack; and our country would have to\r\naccept these consequences, for the express purpose of keeping the\r\nAmericas unsullied by the complications of European politics. Obviously\r\nthere is a contradiction in such a situation. The United States could\r\nfight with some show of reason a single European Power, like France in\r\n1865, which undertook a policy of American territorial aggrandizement;\r\nbut if it were obliged to fight a considerable portion of Europe for the\r\nsame purpose, it would mean that our country was opposing a general, and\r\npresumably a legitimate, European interest. In that event America would\r\nbecome a part of the European political system with a vengeance--a part\r\nwhich in its endeavor to escape from the vicissitudes of European\r\npolitics had brought upon itself a condition of permanent military\r\npreparation and excitement. Consequently, in case the \"Monroe Doctrine\r\nand the Golden Rule\" are to remain the foundation of American foreign\r\npolicy, mere prudence demands a systematic attempt to prevent the\r\nDoctrine from arousing just and effective European opposition.\r\n\r\nNo one can believe more firmly than myself that the foreign policy of a\r\ndemocratic nation should seek by all practicable and inoffensive means\r\nthe affirmation of democracy; but the challenge which the Monroe\r\nDoctrine in its popular form issues to Europe is neither an inoffensive\r\nnor a practicable means of affirmation. It is based usually upon the\r\nnotion of an essential incompatibility between American and European\r\npolitical institutions; and the assertion of such an incompatibility at\r\nthe present time can only be the result of a stupid or willful American\r\ndemocratic Bourbonism. Such an incompatibility did exist when the Holy\r\nAlliance dominated Europe. It does not exist to-day, except in one\r\nparticular. The exception is important, as we shall see presently; but\r\nit does not concern the domestic institutions of the European and the\r\nAmerican states. The emancipated and nationalized European states of\r\nto-day, so far from being essentially antagonistic to the American\r\ndemocratic nation, are constantly tending towards a condition which\r\ninvites closer and more fruitful association with the United States; and\r\nany national doctrine which proclaims a rooted antagonism lies almost at\r\nright angles athwart the road of American democratic national\r\nachievement. Throughout the whole of the nineteenth century the European\r\nnations have been working towards democracy by means of a completer\r\nnational organization; while this country has been working towards\r\nnational cohesion by the mere logic and force of its democratic ideal.\r\nThus the distance between America and Europe is being diminished; and\r\nAmericans in their individual behavior bear the most abundant and\r\ngenerous testimony to the benefits which American democracy can derive\r\nfrom association with the European nations. It is only in relation to\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine that we still make much of the essential\r\nincompatibility between European and American institutions, and by so\r\ndoing we distort and misinterpret the valid meaning of a national\r\ndemocratic foreign policy. The existing domestic institutions of the\r\nEuropean nations are for the most part irrelevant to such a policy.\r\n\r\nThe one way in which the foreign policy of the United States can make\r\nfor democracy is by strengthening and encouraging those political\r\nforces which make for international peace. The one respect in which the\r\npolitical system, represented by the United States, is still\r\nantagonistic to the European political system is that the European\r\nnation, whatever its ultimate tendency, is actually organized for\r\naggressive war, that the cherished purposes of some of its states cannot\r\nbe realized without war, and that the forces which hope to benefit by\r\nwar are stronger than the forces which hope to benefit by peace. That is\r\nthe indubitable reason why the United States must remain aloof from the\r\nEuropean system and must avoid scrupulously any entanglements in the\r\ncomplicated web of European international affairs. The policy of\r\nisolation is in this respect as wise to-day as it was in the time of its\r\nenunciation by Washington and Hamilton; and nobody seriously proposes to\r\ndepart from it. On the other hand, the basis for this policy is wholly\r\nindependent of the domestic institutions of the European nations. It\r\nderives from the fact that at any time those nations may go to war about\r\nquestions in which the United States has no vital interest. The\r\ngeographical situation of the United States emancipates her from these\r\nconflicts, and enables her to stand for the ultimate democratic interest\r\nin international peace.\r\n\r\nThis justifiable policy of isolation has, moreover, certain important\r\nconsequences in respect to the foreign policy of the United States in\r\nthe two Americas. In this field, also, the United States must stand in\r\nevery practicable way for a peaceful international system, and whatever\r\nvalidity the Monroe Doctrine may have in its relation to the European\r\nnations is the outcome of that obligation. If South and Central America\r\nwere thrown open to European colonial ambitions, they would be involved\r\nvery much more than they are at present in the consequences of European\r\nwars. In this sense the increase of European political influence in the\r\ntwo Americas would be an undesirable thing which the United States would\r\nhave good reason to oppose. In this sense the extension of the European\r\nsystem to the American hemisphere would involve consequences inimical to\r\ndemocracy. In 1801 the North was fighting, not merely to preserve\r\nAmerican national integrity, but to prevent the formation of a state on\r\nits southern frontier which could persist only by virtue of a European\r\nalliance, and which would consequently have entangled the free republic\r\nof the Northern states in the network of irrelevant European\r\ncomplications. Such would be the result of any attempt on the part of\r\nthe European states to seek alliances or to pursue an aggressive policy\r\non this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, how can European aggressions in America be opposed,\r\neven on the foregoing ground, without requiring enormous and increasing\r\nmilitary preparations? Would not the Monroe Doctrine, even in that\r\nmodified form, involve the same practical inconsistency which has\r\nalready been attached to its popular expression? The answer is simple.\r\nIt will involve a similar inconsistency unless effective means are taken\r\nto avoid the inevitable dangers of such a challenge to Europe--unless,\r\nthat is, means are taken to prevent Europe from having any just cause\r\nfor intervention in South America for the purpose of protecting its own\r\ninvestment of men and money. The probable necessity of such intervention\r\nis due to the treacherous and unstable political conditions prevailing\r\non that continent; and the Monroe Doctrine, consequently, commits the\r\nUnited States at least to the attempt to constitute in the two Americas\r\na stable and peaceful international system. During the next two or three\r\ngenerations the European states will be too much preoccupied elsewhere\r\nto undertake or even to threaten any serious or concerted interference\r\nin South America. During that interval, while the Monroe Doctrine\r\nremains in its present situation of being unrecognized but unchallenged,\r\nAmerican statesmen will have their opportunity. If the American system\r\ncan be made to stand for peace, just as the European system stands at\r\npresent for war, then the United States will have an unimpeachable\r\nreason in forbidding European intervention. European states would no\r\nlonger have a legitimate ground for interference; it would be impossible\r\nfor them to take any concerted action. The American nation would testify\r\nto its sincere democracy both by its negative attitude towards a\r\nmilitant European system and by its positive promotion of a peaceful\r\ninternational system in the two Americas.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a stable international system either is not or\r\ncannot be constituted in the two Americas, the Monroe Doctrine will\r\nprobably involve this country in wars which would be not merely\r\nexhausting and demoralizing, but fruitless. We should be fighting to\r\nmaintain a political system which would be in no essential respect\r\nsuperior to the European political system. The South and Central\r\nAmerican states have been almost as ready to fight among themselves, and\r\nto cherish political plans which can be realized only by war, as the\r\nEuropean states. In the course of time, as they grow in population and\r\nwealth, they also will entertain more or less desirable projects of\r\nexpansion; and the resulting conflicts would, the United States\r\npermitting, be sure to involve European alliances and complications. Why\r\nshould the United States prepare for war in order to preserve the\r\nintegrity of states which, if left to themselves, might well have an\r\ninterest in compromising their own independence, and which, unless\r\nsubjected to an edifying pressure, would probably make comparatively\r\npoor use of the independence they enjoyed? Surely the only valid reason\r\nfor fighting in order to prevent the growth of European political\r\ninfluence in the two Americas is the creation of a political system on\r\nbehalf of which it is worth while to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA STABLE AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nPossibly some of my readers will have inferred by this time that the\r\nestablishment of a peaceable international system in the two Americas is\r\nonly a sanctimonious paraphrase for a policy on the part of this country\r\nof political aggrandizement in the Western hemisphere. Such an inference\r\nwould be wholly unjust. Before such a system can be established, the use\r\nof compulsion may on some occasions be necessary; but the United States\r\nacting individually, could rarely afford to employ forcible means. An\r\nessential condition of the realization of the proposed system would be\r\nthe ability of American statesmen to convince the Latin-Americans of the\r\ndisinterestedness of their country's intentions; and to this end the\r\nactive coöperation of one or more Latin-American countries in the\r\nrealization of the plan would be indispensable. The statesmen of this\r\ncountry can work without coöperation as long as they are merely seeking\r\nto arouse public sentiment in favor of such a plan, or as long as they\r\nare clearing away preliminary obstacles; but no decisive step can be\r\ntaken without assurance of support on the part of a certain proportion\r\nof the Latin-American states, and the best way gradually to obtain such\r\nsupport has already been indicated by Mr. Elihu Root during his official\r\nterm as Secretary of State. He has begun the work of coming to an\r\nunderstanding with the best element in South American opinion by his\r\ncandid and vigorous expression of the fundamental interest of the United\r\nStates in its relations with its American neighbors.\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago the attempt to secure effective support from any of\r\nthe Latin-American states in the foundation of a stable American\r\ninternational system would have looked hopeless. Countries with so\r\nappalling a record of domestic violence and instability could apparently\r\nbe converted to a permanently peaceable behavior in respect to their\r\nneighbors only by the use of force. But recently several niches have\r\nbeen built into the American political structure on which a foothold may\r\neventually be obtained. In general the political condition of the more\r\npowerful Latin-American states, such as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and\r\nChile, has become more stable and more wholesome. If their condition of\r\nstability and health persists, their industrial and commercial\r\nprosperity will also continue; and little by little their political\r\npurposes will become more explicit and more significant. As soon as this\r\nstage is reached, it should be possible for American statesmen to\r\nestimate accurately the weight of the probable obstacles which any\r\nmovement towards an international agreement would encounter. A series of\r\nparticular steps could then be taken, tending to remove such obstacles,\r\nand, if wise, the whole question of an international agreement could be\r\nraised in some definite way.\r\n\r\nSuch obstacles may prove to be insurmountable; but provided the\r\nLatin-Americans can be convinced of the disinterestedness of this\r\ncountry, they do not look insurmountable. Acquiescence in a permanent\r\nAmerican international system would, of course, imply a certain\r\nsacrifice of independence on the part of the several contracting states;\r\nbut in return for this sacrifice their situation in respect to their\r\nneighbors would receive a desirable certification. They would renounce\r\nthe right of going to war in return for a guarantee of their\r\nindependence in other respects, and for the consequent chance of an\r\nindefinite period of orderly economic and social development. Whether\r\nthey can ever be brought to such a renunciation will depend, of course,\r\non the conception of their national interest which the more important\r\nLatin-American states will reach. As long as any one of them cherishes\r\nobjects which can only be realized by war, the international situation\r\nin the Western hemisphere will remain similar to that of Europe. An\r\nactual or latent aggressiveness on the part of any one nation inevitably\r\nprovokes its neighbors into a defiant and suspicious temper. It is too\r\nsoon to predict whether the economic and political development of the\r\nLatin-Americans during the next generation will make for a warlike or a\r\npeaceful international organization; but considering the political\r\ngeography of South America and the manifest economic interests of the\r\nseveral states, it does not look as if any one of them had as much to\r\ngain from a militant organization as it had from a condition of\r\ncomparative international security.\r\n\r\nThe domestic condition of some of the Latin-American states presents a\r\nserious obstacle to the creation of a stable American international\r\nsystem. Such a system presupposes a condition of domestic peace. The\r\nseveral contracting states must possess permanent and genuinely national\r\npolitical organizations; and no such organization is possible as long as\r\nthe tradition and habit of revolution persists. As we have seen, the\r\npolitical habits of the more important states have in this respect\r\nenormously improved of late years, but there remain a number of minor\r\ncountries wherein the right of revolution is cherished as the essential\r\nprinciple of their democracy. Just what can be done with such states is\r\na knotty problem. In all probability no American international system\r\nwill ever be established without the forcible pacification of one or\r\nmore such centers of disorder. Coercion should, of course, be used only\r\nin the case of extreme necessity; and it would not be just to deprive\r\nthe people of such states of the right of revolution, unless effective\r\nmeasures were at the same time taken to do away with the more or less\r\nlegitimate excuses for revolutionary protest. In short, any\r\ninternational American political system might have to undertake a task\r\nin states like Venezuela, similar to that which the United States is now\r\nperforming in Cuba. That any attempt to secure domestic stability would\r\nbe disinterested, if not successful, would be guaranteed by the\r\nparticipation or the express acquiescence therein of the several\r\ncontracting states.\r\n\r\nThe United States has already made an effective beginning in this great\r\nwork, both by the pacification of Cuba and by the attempt to introduce a\r\nlittle order into the affairs of the turbulent Central American\r\nrepublics. The construction of the Panama Canal has given this country\r\nan exceptional interest in the prevalence of order and good government\r\nin the territory between Panama and Mexico; and in the near future our\r\nbest opportunity for improving international political conditions in the\r\nWestern hemisphere will be found in this comparatively limited but, from\r\na selfish point of view, peculiarly important field. Within this\r\nrestricted area the same obstacles will be encountered as in the larger\r\narea, and success will depend upon the use of similar means and the\r\nexhibition of similar qualities. Very little can be achieved in Central\r\nAmerica without the coöperation of Mexico, and without the ability to\r\nconvince Mexican statesmen of the disinterested intentions of this\r\ncountry. In the same way any recrudescence of revolutionary upheavals in\r\nMexico would enormously increase the difficulties and perils of the\r\nattempt. On the other hand, success in bringing about with Mexican\r\ncoöperation a condition of political security and comparative stability\r\nin Central America would augur well for the success of the larger and\r\nmore difficult attempt to perform a similar work for the whole American\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult task, however, connected with the establishment of a\r\npeaceful American international system is presented by Canada. In case\r\nsuch a system were constituted, Canada should most assuredly form a part\r\nof it. Yet she could not form a part of it without a radical alteration\r\nin her relations with Great Britain. Canada is tied to the British\r\nImperial system, and her policy and destiny depends upon the policy and\r\ndestiny of the British Empire. She is content with this situation, not\r\nmerely because she is loyal to the mother country, but because she\r\nbelieves that her association with Great Britain guarantees her\r\nindependence in respect to the United States. Many Canadians cherish a\r\nprofound conviction that the United States wishes nothing so much as\r\nthe annexation of the Dominion; and the one thing in the world which\r\nthey propose to prevent is a successful attack upon their independence.\r\nThis is the natural attitude of a numerically weak people, divided by a\r\nlong and indefensible frontier from a numerous and powerful neighbor;\r\nand while the people of this country have done nothing since the War of\r\n1812 positively to provoke such suspicions, they have, on the other\r\nhand, done nothing to allay them. We have never attempted to secure the\r\ngood will of the Canadians in any respect; and we have never done\r\nanything to establish better relations. Yet unless such better relations\r\nare established, the United States will lose an indispensable ally in\r\nthe making of a satisfactory political system in the Western hemisphere\r\nwhile at the same time the American people will be in the sorry\r\nsituation for a sincere democracy of having created only apprehension\r\nand enmity on the part of their nearest and most intelligent neighbors.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the very first object of the foreign policy of\r\nthe United States should be to place its relations with Canada on a\r\nbetter footing. There was a time when this object could have been\r\naccomplished by the negotiation of a liberal treaty of commercial\r\nreciprocity. If the commercial policy of the United States had been\r\ndetermined by its manifest national interest instead of by the interests\r\nof a group of special industries, such a treaty would have been signed\r\nmany years ago. A great opportunity was lost when the negotiations\r\nfailed early in the eighties, because ever since Canada has been\r\ntightening her commercial ties with Great Britain; and these ties will\r\nbe still further tightened as Canada grows into a large grain-exporting\r\ncountry. But while it will be impossible to make an arrangement as\r\nadvantageous as the one which might have been made twenty-five years\r\nago, the national interest plainly demands the negotiation of the most\r\nsatisfactory treaty possible at the present time; and if the special\r\ninterests of a few industries are allowed to stand indefinitely in the\r\nway, we shall be plainly exhibiting our incompetence to carry out an\r\nenlightened and a truly national foreign policy. We shall be branding\r\nourselves with the mark of a merely trading democracy which is unable to\r\nsubordinate the selfish interests of a few of its citizens to the\r\nrealization of a policy combining certain commercial advantages with an\r\nessential national object. Just as the maintenance of the present high\r\nprotective tariff is the clearest possible indication of the domination\r\nof special over national interests in domestic politics, so the resolute\r\nopposition which these industries show to the use of the tariff as an\r\ninstrument of a national foreign policy, suggests that the first duty of\r\nthe United States as a nation is to testify to its emancipation from\r\nsuch bondage by revising the tariff. The matter concerns not merely\r\nCanada, but the South American Republics; and it is safe to say that the\r\npresent policy of blind protection is an absolute bar to the realization\r\nof that improved American political system which is the correlative in\r\nforeign affairs of domestic individual and social amelioration.\r\n\r\nThe desirable result of the utmost possible commercial freedom between\r\nCanada and the United States would be to prepare the way for closer\r\npolitical association. By closer political association I do not mean the\r\nannexation of Canada to the United States. Such annexation might not be\r\ndesirable even with the consent of Canada. What I do mean is some\r\npolitical recognition of the fact that the real interests of Canada in\r\nforeign affairs coincide with the interests of the United States rather\r\nthan with the interests of Great Britain. Great Britain's interest in\r\nthe independence of Holland or in the maintenance of the Turkish power\r\nin Europe might involve England in a European war, in which Canada would\r\nhave none but a sentimental stake, but from which she might suffer\r\nsevere losses. At bottom Canada needs for her political and commercial\r\nwelfare disentanglement from European complications just as much as does\r\nthe United States; and the diplomacy, official and unofficial, of the\r\nUnited States, should seek to convince Canada of the truth of this\r\nstatement. Neither need a policy which looked in that direction\r\nnecessarily incur the enmity of Great Britain. In view of the increasing\r\ncost of her responsibilities in Europe and in Asia, England has a great\r\ndeal to gain by concentration and by a partial retirement from the\r\nAmerican continent, so far as such a retirement could be effected\r\nwithout being recreant to her responsibilities towards Canada. The need\r\nof such retirement has already been indicated by the diminution of her\r\nfleet in American waters; and if her expenses and difficulties in Europe\r\nand Asia increase, she might be glad to reach some arrangement with\r\nCanada and the United States which would recognize a dominant Canadian\r\ninterest in freedom from exclusively European political vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nSuch an arrangement is very remote; but it looks as if under certain\r\nprobable future conditions, a treaty along the following lines might be\r\nacceptable to Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. The American\r\nand the English governments would jointly guarantee the independence of\r\nCanada. Canada, on her part, would enter into an alliance with the\r\nUnited States, looking towards the preservation of peace on the American\r\ncontinents and the establishment of an American international political\r\nsystem. Canada and the United States in their turn would agree to lend\r\nthe support of their naval forces to Great Britain in the event of a\r\ngeneral European war, but solely for the purpose of protecting the\r\ncargoes of grain and other food which might be needed by Great Britain.\r\nSurely the advantages of such an arrangement would be substantial and\r\nwell-distributed. Canada would feel secure in her independence, and\r\nwould be emancipated from irrelevant European complications. The United\r\nStates would gain support, which is absolutely essential for the proper\r\npacification of the American continent, and would pay for that support\r\nonly by an engagement consonant with her interest as a food-exporting\r\npower. Great Britain would exchange a costly responsibility for an\r\nassurance of food in the one event, which Britons must fear--viz., a\r\ngeneral European war with strong maritime powers on the other side. Such\r\nan arrangement would, of course, be out of the question at present; but\r\nit suggests the kind of treaty which might lead Great Britain to consent\r\nto the national emancipation of Canada, and which could be effected\r\nwithout endangering Canadian independence.\r\n\r\nAny systematic development of the foreign policy of the United States,\r\nsuch as proposed herewith, will seem very wild to the majority of\r\nAmericans. They will not concede its desirability, because the American\r\nhabit is to proclaim doctrines and policies, without considering either\r\nthe implications, the machinery necessary to carry them out, or the\r\nweight of the resulting responsibilities. But in estimating the\r\npracticability of the policy proposed, the essential idea must be\r\ndisentangled from any possible methods of realizing it--such as the\r\nsuggested treaty between the United States, Great Britain, and Canada.\r\nAn agreement along those lines may never be either practicable or\r\nprudent, but the validity of the essential idea remains unaffected by\r\nthe abandonment of a detail. That idea demands that effective and\r\nfar-sighted arrangements be made in order to forestall the inevitable\r\nfuture objections on the part of European nations to an uncompromising\r\ninsistence on the Monroe Doctrine; and no such arrangement is possible,\r\nexcept by virtue of Canadian and Mexican coöperation as well as that of\r\nsome of the South American states. It remains for American statesmanship\r\nand diplomacy to discover little by little what means are practicable\r\nand how much can be accomplished under any particular set of conditions.\r\nA candid man must admit that the obstacles may prove to be insuperable.\r\nOne of any number of possible contingencies may serve to postpone its\r\nrealization indefinitely. Possibly neither Canada nor Great Britain will\r\nconsent to any accommodation with the United States. Possibly one or\r\nmore South American states will assume an aggressive attitude towards\r\ntheir neighbors. Possibly their passions, prejudices, and suspicions\r\nwill make them prefer the hazards and the costs of military preparations\r\nand absolute technical independence, even though their interests counsel\r\nanother course. Possibly the consequences of some general war in Europe\r\nor Asia will react on the two Americas and embroil the international\r\nsituation to the point of hopeless misunderstanding and confusion.\r\nIndeed, the probabilities are that in America as in Europe the road to\r\nany permanent international settlement will be piled mountain high with\r\ndead bodies, and will be traveled, if at all, only after a series of\r\nabortive and costly experiments. But remote and precarious as is the\r\nestablishment of any American international system, it is not for\r\nAmerican statesmen necessarily either an impracticable, an irrelevant,\r\nor an unworthy object. Fail though we may in the will, the intelligence,\r\nor the power to carry it out, the systematic effort to establish a\r\npeaceable American system is just as plain and just as inevitable a\r\nconsequence of the democratic national principle, as is the effort to\r\nmake our domestic institutions contribute to the work of individual and\r\nsocial amelioration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY AND PEACE\r\n\r\nA genuinely national foreign policy for the American democracy is not\r\nexhausted by the Monroe Doctrine. The United States already has certain\r\ncolonial interests; and these interests may hereafter be extended. I do\r\nnot propose at the present stage of this discussion to raise the\r\nquestion as to the legitimacy in principle of a colonial policy on the\r\npart of a democratic nation. The validity of colonial expansion even for\r\na democracy is a manifest deduction from the foregoing political\r\nprinciples, always assuming that the people whose independence is\r\nthereby diminished are incapable of efficient national organization. On\r\nthe other hand, a democratic nation cannot righteously ignore an\r\nunusually high standard of obligation for the welfare of its colonial\r\npopulation. It would be distinctly recreant to its duty, in case it\r\nfailed to provide for the economic prosperity of such a population, and\r\nfor their educational discipline and social improvement. It by no means\r\nfollows, however, that because there is no rigid objection on democratic\r\nprinciples to colonial expansion, there may not be the strongest\r\npractical objection on the score of national interest to the acquisition\r\nof any particular territory. A remote colony is, under existing\r\ninternational conditions, even more of a responsibility than it is a\r\nsource of national power and efficiency; and it is always a grave\r\nquestion how far the assumption of any particular responsibility is\r\nworth while.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into any specific discussion, there can, I think, be\r\nlittle doubt that the United States was justified in assuming its\r\nexisting responsibilities in respect to Cuba and its much more abundant\r\nresponsibilities in respect to Porto Rico. Neither can it be fairly\r\nclaimed that hitherto the United States has not dealt disinterestedly\r\nand in good faith with the people of these islands. On the other hand,\r\nour acquisition of the Philippines raises a series of much more doubtful\r\nquestions. These islands have been so far merely an expensive\r\nobligation, from which little benefit has resulted to this country and a\r\ncomparatively moderate benefit to the Filipinos. They have already cost\r\nan amount of money far beyond any chance of compensation, and an amount\r\nof American and Filipino blood, the shedding of which constitutes a\r\ngrave responsibility. Their future defense against possible attack\r\npresents a military and naval problem of the utmost difficulty. In fact,\r\nthey cannot be defended from Japan except by the maintenance of a fleet\r\nin Pacific waters at least as large as the Japanese fleet; and it does\r\nnot look probable that the United States will be able to afford for\r\nanother generation any such concentration of naval strength in the\r\nPacific. But even though from the military point of view the Philippines\r\nmay constitute a source of weakness and danger, their possession will\r\nhave the political advantage of keeping the American people alive to\r\ntheir interests in the grave problems which will be raised in the Far\r\nEast by the future development of China and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe future of China raises questions of American foreign policy second\r\nonly in importance to the establishment of a stable American\r\ninternational organization; and in relation to these questions, also,\r\nthe interests of the United States and Canada tend both to coincide and\r\nto diverge (possibly) from those of Great Britain. Just what form the\r\nChinese question will assume, after the industrial and the political\r\nawakening of China has resulted in a more effective military\r\norganization and in greater powers both of production and consumption,\r\ncannot be predicted with any certainty; but at present, it looks as if\r\nthe maintenance of the traditional American policy with respect to\r\nChina, viz., the territorial integrity and the free commercial\r\ndevelopment of that country, might require quite as considerable a\r\nconcentration of naval strength in the Pacific as is required by the\r\ndefense of the Philippines. It is easy enough to enunciate such a\r\npolicy, just as it is easy to proclaim a Monroe Doctrine which no\r\nEuropean Power has any sufficient immediate interest to dispute; but it\r\nis wholly improbable that China can be protected in its territorial\r\nintegrity and its political independence without a great deal of\r\ndiplomacy and more or less fighting. During the life of the coming\r\ngeneration there will be brought home clearly to the American people how\r\nmuch it will cost to assert its own essential interests in China; and\r\nthe peculiar value of the Philippines as an American colony will consist\r\nlargely in the fact that they will help American public opinion to\r\nrealize more quickly than it otherwise would the complications and\r\nresponsibilities created by Chinese political development and by\r\nJapanese ambition.\r\n\r\nThe existence and the resolute and intelligent facing of such\r\nresponsibilities are an inevitable and a wholesome aspect of national\r\ndiscipline and experience. The American people have too easily evaded\r\nthem in the past, but in the future they cannot be evaded; and it is\r\nbetter so. The irresponsible attitude of Americans in respect to their\r\nnational domestic problems may in part be traced to freedom from equally\r\ngrave international responsibilities. In truth, the work of internal\r\nreconstruction and amelioration, so far from being opposed to that of\r\nthe vigorous assertion of a valid foreign policy, is really correlative\r\nand supplementary thereto; and it is entirely possible that hereafter\r\nthe United States will be forced into the adoption of a really national\r\ndomestic policy because of the dangers and duties incurred through her\r\nrelations with foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe increasingly strenuous nature of international competition and the\r\nconstantly higher standards of international economic, technical, and\r\npolitical efficiency prescribe a constantly improving domestic political\r\nand economic organization. The geographical isolation which affords the\r\nUnited States its military security against foreign attack should not\r\nblind Americans to the merely comparative nature of their isolation. The\r\ngrowth of modern sea power and the vast sweep of modern national\r\npolitical interests have at once diminished their security, and\r\nmultiplied the possible sources of contact between American and European\r\ninterests. No matter how peaceably the United States is inclined, and no\r\nmatter how advantageously it is situated, the American nation is none\r\nthe less constantly threatened by political warfare, and constantly\r\nengaged in industrial warfare. The American people can no more afford\r\nthan can a European people to neglect any necessary kind or source of\r\nefficiency. Sooner than ever before in the history of the world do a\r\nnation's sins and deficiencies find it out. Under modern conditions a\r\ncountry which takes its responsibilities lightly, and will not submit to\r\nthe discipline necessary to political efficiency, does not gradually\r\ndecline, as Spain did in the seventeenth century. It usually goes down\r\nwith a crash, as France did in 1870, or as Russia has just done. The\r\neffect of diminishing economic efficiency is not as suddenly and\r\ndramatically exhibited; but it is no less inevitable and no less severe.\r\nAnd the service which the very intensity of modern international\r\ncompetition renders to a living nation arises precisely from the\r\nsearching character of the tests to which it subjects the several\r\nnational organizations. Austria-Hungary has been forced to assume a\r\nsecondary position in Europe, because the want of national cohesion and\r\nvitality deprived her political advance of all momentum. Russia has\r\nsuddenly discovered that a corrupt bureaucracy is incapable of a\r\nnational organization as efficient as modern military and political\r\ncompetition requires. It was desirable in the interest of the Austrians,\r\nthe Hungarians, and the Russians, that these weaknesses should be\r\nexposed; and if the Christian states of the West ever become so\r\norganized that their weaknesses are concealed until their consequences\r\nbecome irremediable, Western civilization itself will be on the road to\r\ndecline. The Atlantic Ocean will, in the long run, fail to offer the\r\nUnited States any security from the application of the same searching\r\nstandards. Its democratic institutions must be justified, not merely by\r\nthe prosperity which they bestow upon its own citizens, but by its\r\nability to meet the standards of efficiency imposed by other nations.\r\nIts standing as a nation is determined precisely by its ability to\r\nconquer and to hold a dignified and important place in the society of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe inference inevitably is that the isolation which has meant so much\r\nto the United States, and still means so much, cannot persist in its\r\npresent form. Its geographical position will always have a profound\r\ninfluence on the strategic situation of the United States in respect to\r\nthe European Powers. It should always emancipate the United States from\r\nmerely European complications. But, while the American nation should\r\nnever seek a positive place in an exclusively European system, Europe,\r\nthe United States, Japan, and China must all eventually take their\r\nrespective places in a world system. While such a system is still so\r\nremote that it merely shows dimly through the obscurity of the future,\r\nits manifest desirability brings with it certain definite but contingent\r\nobligations in addition to the general obligation of comprehensive and\r\nthorough-going national efficiency. It brings with it the obligation of\r\ninterfering under certain possible circumstances in what may at first\r\nappear to be a purely European complication; and this specific\r\nobligation would be the result of the general obligation of a democratic\r\nnation to make its foreign policy serve the cause of international\r\npeace. Hitherto, the American preference and desire for peace has\r\nconstituted the chief justification for its isolation. At some future\r\ntime the same purpose, just in so far as it is sincere and rational, may\r\ndemand intervention. The American responsibility in this respect is\r\nsimilar to that of any peace-preferring European Power. If it wants\r\npeace, it must be spiritually and physically prepared to fight for it.\r\nPeace will prevail in international relations, just as order prevails\r\nwithin a nation, because of the righteous use of superior force--because\r\nthe power which makes for pacific organization is stronger than the\r\npower which makes for a warlike organization. It looks as if at some\r\nfuture time the power of the United States might well be sufficient,\r\nwhen thrown into the balance, to tip the scales in favor of a\r\ncomparatively pacific settlement of international complications. Under\r\nsuch conditions a policy of neutrality would be a policy of\r\nirresponsibility and unwisdom.\r\n\r\nThe notion of American intervention in a European conflict, carrying\r\nwith it either the chance or the necessity of war, would at present be\r\nreceived with pious horror by the great majority of Americans.\r\nNon-interference in European affairs is conceived, not as a policy\r\ndependent upon certain conditions, but as absolute law--derived from the\r\nsacred writings. If the issue should be raised in the near future, the\r\nAmerican people would be certain to shirk it; and they would, perhaps,\r\nhave some reason for a failure to understand their obligation, because\r\nthe course of European political development has not as yet been such as\r\nto raise the question in a decisive form. All one can say as to the\r\nexisting situation is that there are certain Powers which have very much\r\nmore to lose than they have to gain by war. These Powers are no longer\r\nsmall states like Belgium, Switzerland, and Holland, but populous and\r\npowerful states like Great Britain, Italy, and France. It may be one or\r\nit may be many generations before the issue of a peaceful or a warlike\r\norganization is decisively raised. When, if ever, it is decisively\r\nraised, the system of public law, under which any organization would\r\nhave to take place, may not be one which the United States could accept.\r\nBut the point is that, whenever and however it is raised, the American\r\nnational leaders should confront it with a sound, well-informed, and\r\npositive conception of the American national interest rather than a\r\nnegative and ignorant conception. And there is at least a fair chance\r\nthat such will be the case. The experience of the American people in\r\nforeign affairs is only beginning, and during the next few generations\r\nthe growth of their traffic with Asia and Europe will afford them every\r\nreason and every opportunity to ponder seriously the great international\r\nproblem of peace in its relation to the American national democratic\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe idea which is most likely to lead them astray is the idea which\r\nvitiates the Monroe Doctrine in its popular form,--the idea of some\r\nessential incompatibility between Europeanism and Americanism. That idea\r\nhas given a sort of religious sanctity to the national tradition of\r\nisolation; and it will survive its own utility because it flatters\r\nAmerican democratic vanity. But if such an idea should prevent the\r\nAmerican nation from contributing its influence to the establishment of\r\na peaceful system in Europe, America, and Asia, such a refusal would be\r\na decisive stop toward American democratic degeneracy. It would either\r\nmean that the American nation preferred its apparently safe and easy\r\nisolation to the dangers and complications which would inevitably attend\r\nthe final establishment of a just system of public law; or else it would\r\nmean that the American people believed more in Americanism than they did\r\nin democracy. A decent guarantee of international peace would be\r\nprecisely the political condition which would enable the European\r\nnations to release the springs of democracy; and the Americanism which\r\nwas indifferent or suspicious of the spread of democracy in Europe would\r\nincur and deserve the enmity of the European peoples. Such an attitude\r\nwould constitute a species of continental provincialism and chauvinism.\r\nHence there is no shibboleth that patriotic Americans should fight more\r\ntenaciously and more fiercely than of America for the Americans, and\r\nEurope for the Europeans. To make Pan-Americanism merely a matter of\r\ngeography is to deprive it of all serious meaning. Pan-Slavism or\r\nPan-Germanism, based upon a racial bond, would be a far more significant\r\npolitical idea. The only possible foundation of Pan-Americanism is an\r\nideal democratic purpose--which, when translated into terms of\r\ninternational relations, demands, in the first place, the establishment\r\nof a pacific system of public law in the two Americas, and in the second\r\nplace, an alliance with the pacific European Powers, just in so far as a\r\nsimilar system has become in that continent one of the possibilities of\r\npractical politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS OF RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSTATE INSTITUTIONAL REFORM\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapter I have traced the larger aspects of a\r\nconstructive relation between the national and democratic principles in\r\nthe field of foreign politics. The task remains of depicting somewhat in\r\ndetail the aspect which our more important domestic problems assume from\r\nthe point of view of the same relationship. The general outlines of this\r\npicture have already been roughly sketched; but the mere sketch of a\r\nfruitful general policy is not enough. A national policy must be\r\njustified by the flexibility with which, without any loss of its\r\nintegrity, it can be applied to specific problems, differing radically\r\none from another in character and significance. That the idea of a\r\nconstructive relationship between nationality and democracy is flexible\r\nwithout being invertebrate is one of its greatest merits. It is not a\r\nrigid abstract and partial ideal, as is that of an exclusively socialist\r\nor an exclusively individualist democracy. Neither is it merely a\r\ncompromise, suited to certain practical exigencies, between\r\nindividualism and socialism. Its central formative idea can lend itself\r\nto many different and novel applications, while still remaining true to\r\nits own fundamental interest.\r\n\r\nFlexible though the national ideal may be, its demands are in one\r\nrespect inflexible. It is the strenuous and irrevocable enemy of the\r\npolicy of drift. It can counsel patience; but it cannot abide collective\r\nindifference or irresponsibility. A constructive national ideal must at\r\nleast seek humbly to be constructive. The only question is, as to how\r\nthis responsibility for the collective welfare can at any one time be\r\nmost usefully redeemed. In the case of our own country at the present\r\ntime an intelligent conception of the national interest will counsel\r\npatient agitation rather than any hazardous attempts at radical\r\nreconstruction. No such reform can be permanent, or even healthy, until\r\nAmerican public opinion has been converted to a completer realization of\r\nthe nature and extent of its national responsibilities. The ship of\r\nreform will gather most headway from the association of certain very\r\nmoderate practical proposals with the issue of a deliberate, persistent,\r\nand far more radical challenge to popular political prejudices and\r\nerrors. It will be sufficient, in case our practical proposals seek to\r\naccomplish some small measure both of political and economic\r\nreconstruction, and in case they occupy some sort of a family relation\r\nto plans of the same kind with which American public opinion is already\r\nmore or less familiar.\r\n\r\nIn considering this matter of institutional reform, I shall be guided\r\nchiefly by the extent to which certain specific reforms have already\r\nbecome living questions. From this point of view it would be a sheer\r\nwaste of time just at present to discuss seriously any radical\r\nmodification, say, of the Federal Constitution. Certain transformations\r\nof the Constitution either by insidious effect of practice, by\r\ndeliberate judicial construction, or by amendment are, of course, an\r\ninevitable aspect of the contemporary American political problem; but\r\nall such possible and proposed changes must be confined to specific\r\ndetails. They should not raise any question as to the fundamental\r\ndesirability of a system of checks and balances or of the other\r\nprinciples upon which the Federal political organization is based. Much,\r\nconsequently, as a political theorist may be interested in some ideal\r\nplan of American national organization, it will be of little benefit\r\nunder existing conditions to enter into such a discussion. Let it wait\r\nuntil Americans have come to think seriously and consistently about\r\nfundamental political problems. The Federal Constitution is not all it\r\nshould be, but it is better than any substitute upon which American\r\npublic opinion could now agree. Modifications may and should somehow be\r\nmade in details, but for the present not in fundamentals. On the other\r\nhand, no similar sanctity attaches to municipal charters and state\r\nconstitutions. The ordinary state constitution is a sufficiently\r\nephemeral piece of legislation. State and municipal political forms are\r\nbeing constantly changed, and they are being changed because they have\r\nbeen so extremely unsatisfactory in their actual operation. The local\r\npolitical machinery becomes, consequently, the natural and useful\r\nsubject of reconstructive experiments. A policy of institutional reform\r\nmust prove its value and gain its experience chiefly in this field; and\r\nin formulating such a policy reformers will be placing their hands upon\r\nthe most palpable and best-recognized weakness in the American political\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nA popular but ill-founded American political illusion concerns the\r\nsuccess of their state governments. Americans tend to believe that these\r\ngovernments have on the whole served them well, whereas in truth they\r\nhave on the whole been ill served by their machinery of local\r\nadministration and government. The failure has not, perhaps, been as\r\negregious or as scandalous as has been that of their municipal\r\ninstitutions; but it has been sufficiently serious to provoke continual\r\nbut abortive attempts to improve them; and it has had so many dangerous\r\nconsequences that the cause and cure of their inefficiency constitute\r\none of the most fundamental of American political problems. The\r\nconsequences of the failure have been mitigated because the weakness of\r\nthe state governments has been partly concealed and redeemed by the\r\ncomparative strength and efficiency of the central government. But the\r\nfailures have none the less been sufficiently distressing; and if they\r\nare permitted to continue, they will compromise the success of the\r\nAmerican democratic experiment. The Federal government has done much to\r\nameliorate the condition of the American people, whereas the state\r\ngovernments have done little or nothing. Instead of representing, as a\r\ngovernment should, the better contemporary ideals and methods, they have\r\nreflected at best the average standard of popular behavior and at worst\r\na standard decidedly below the average. The lawlessness which so many\r\nAmericans bemoan in American life must be traced to the inefficiency of\r\nthe state governments. If the central government had shared this\r\nweakness, the American political organism would have already dissolved\r\nin violence and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe local authorities retain under the American Federal organization\r\nmany of the primary functions of government. They preserve order,\r\nadminister civil and criminal justice, collect taxes for general and\r\nlocal purposes, and are directly or indirectly responsible for the\r\nsystem of public education. If it can be proved that the state\r\ngovernments have exercised any of these functions in an efficient\r\nmanner, that proof certainly does not lie upon the surface of the facts.\r\nThe provisions they have made for keeping order have been utterly\r\ninadequate, and have usually broken down when any serious reason for\r\ndisorder has existed. A certain part of this violence is, moreover, the\r\nimmediate result of the failure of American criminal justice. The\r\ncriminal laws have been so carefully framed and so admirably expounded\r\nfor the benefit of the lawyers and their clients, the malefactors, that\r\na very large proportion of American murderers escape the proper penalty\r\nof their acts; and these dilatory and dubious judicial methods are\r\nundoubtedly one effective cause of the prevalence of lynching in the\r\nSouth. There is more to be said in favor of our civil than of our\r\ncriminal courts. In spite of a good deal of corruption and of\r\nsubserviency to special interests, the judges are usually honest men and\r\ngood average lawyers; but the fact that they are elected for\r\ncomparatively short terms has made them the creatures of the political\r\nmachine, and has demoralized their political standards. They use court\r\npatronage largely for the benefit of the machine; and whatever influence\r\nthey have in politics is usually exercised in favor of the professional\r\npolitician. If they do not constitute a positive weakness in the system\r\nof local government, they are certainly far from constituting a source\r\nof strength; and considering the extent to which our government is a\r\ngovernment of judges, they should exercise a far more beneficent\r\ninfluence than they do.\r\n\r\nNeither are the administrative and legislative responsibilities of the\r\nstates redeemed with any more success. The tax systems of the several\r\nstates are in a chaotic condition. Their basis consists of the old\r\nproperty tax, which under its application to modern conditions has\r\nbecome both unjust and unproductive, but which the state legislatures\r\nseem to be wholly incapable of either abandoning or properly\r\ntransforming. In the matter of education the states have been, except in\r\nthe South, liberal; but they have not been as intelligent and\r\nwell-informed as they have been well-intentioned. The educational system\r\nof the country is not only chaotic, but it is very imperfectly adapted\r\nto the needs of an industrial and agricultural democracy. Finally, if\r\nthe legislatures of the several states have ever done anything to\r\nincrease respect for the wisdom and conservatism of American\r\nrepresentative government, it is certainly hard to discover indications\r\nthereof. The financial and economic legislation of the states has\r\nusually shown incompetence and frequently dishonesty. They have\r\nsometimes been ready to repudiate their debts. In their relations to the\r\ncorporations they have occupied the positions alternately of\r\nblackmailers and creatures. They have been as ready to confiscate\r\nprivate property as they have to confer on it excessive privileges. If\r\nthe word \"law\" means something less majestic and authoritative to\r\nAmericans than it should, the mass of trivial, contradictory, unwise,\r\nephemeral, and corrupt legislation passed by the state legislatures is\r\nlargely responsible.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a certain part of this failure of the state governments is\r\nirremediable as long as existing standards of public and private\r\nmorality prevail; but most assuredly a certain part is the direct result\r\nof unwise organization. American state governments have been corrupt and\r\ninefficient largely because they have been organized for the benefit of\r\ncorrupt and inefficient men; and as long as they continue to be\r\norganized on such a basis, no permanent or substantial improvement can\r\nbe expected. Moreover, any reorganization in order to be effective must\r\nnot deal merely with details and expedients. It must be as radical as\r\nare the existing disorganization and abuses. It must be founded on a\r\ndifferent relation between the executive and legislative branches and a\r\nwholly different conception of the function of a state legislative body.\r\n\r\nThe demand for some such reorganization has already become popular,\r\nparticularly in the West. A generation or more ago the makers of new\r\nstate constitutions, being confronted by palpable proofs of the\r\ninefficiency and corruption of the state governments, sought to provide\r\na remedy chiefly by limiting the power of the legislature. All sorts of\r\nimportant details, which would have formerly been left to legislative\r\naction, were incorporated in the fundamental law; and in the same spirit\r\nsevere restrictions were imposed on legislative procedure, designed to\r\nprevent the most flagrant existing abuses. These prudential measures\r\nhave not served to improve the legislative output, and the reformers are\r\nnow crying for more drastic remedies. In the West the tendency is to\r\ntransfer legislative authority from a representative body directly to\r\nthe people. A movement in favor of the initiative and the referendum is\r\ngaining so much headway, that in all probability it will spread\r\nthroughout the country much as the Australian ballot did over a decade\r\nago. But the adoption of the initiative and the referendum substitutes a\r\nnew principle for the one which has hitherto underlain American local\r\ninstitutions. Representative government is either abandoned thereby or\r\nvery much restricted; and direct government, so far as possible, is\r\nsubstituted for it. Such a fundamental principle and tradition as that\r\nof representation should not be thrown away, unless the change can be\r\njustified by a specific, comprehensive, and conclusive analysis of the\r\ncauses of the failure of the state governments.\r\n\r\nThe analysis upon which the advocates of the initiative and the\r\nreferendum base their reform has the merit of being obvious. American\r\nlegislatures have betrayed the interests of their constituents, and have\r\nbeen systematically passing laws for the benefit of corrupt and special\r\ninterests. The people must consequently take back the trust, which has\r\nbeen delegated to representative bodies. They must resume at least the\r\npower to initiate the legislation they want; and no law dealing with a\r\nreally important subject should be passed without their direct consent.\r\n\r\nSuch an analysis of the causes of legislative corruption and\r\nincompetence is not as correct as it is obvious. It is based upon the\r\nold and baleful democratic tendency of always seeking the reason for the\r\nfailure of a democratic enterprise in some personal betrayal of trust.\r\nIt is never the people who are at fault. Neither is the betrayal\r\nattributed to some defect of organization, which neglects to give the\r\nrepresentative individual a sufficient chance. The responsibility for\r\nthe failure is fastened on the selected individual himself, and the\r\nconclusion is drawn that the people cannot trust representatives to\r\nserve them honestly and efficiently. The course of reasoning is\r\nprecisely the same as that which prompted the Athenian democracy to\r\norder the execution of an unsuccessful general. In the case of our state\r\nlegislatures, a most flagrant betrayal of trust has assuredly occurred,\r\nbut before inferring from this betrayal that selected individuals cannot\r\nbe trusted to legislate properly on behalf of their constituents, it\r\nwould be just as well to inquire whether individual incompetence and\r\nturpitude are any sufficient reason for this particular failure of\r\nrepresentative institutions.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact they are no sufficient reason. When a large number\r\nof individuals to whom authority is delegated exercise that authority\r\nimproperly, one may safely infer that the system is at fault as much as\r\nthe individual. Local American legislative organization has courted\r\nfailure. Both the system of representation and functions of the\r\nrepresentative body have been admirably calculated to debase the quality\r\nof the representatives and to nullify the value of their work. American\r\nstate legislatures have really never had a fair opportunity. They have\r\nalmost from the beginning been deprived of any effective responsibility.\r\nThe state constitutions have gradually hedged them in with so many\r\nrestrictions, have gone so much into detail in respect to state\r\norganization and policy that the legislatures really had comparatively\r\nlittle to do, except to deal with matters of current business. They\r\noffered no opportunity for a man of ability and public spirit. When such\r\nmen drifted into a local legislature, they naturally escaped as soon as\r\nthey could to some larger and less obstructed field of action. If the\r\nAmerican people want better legislatures, they must adopt one of two\r\ncourses. Either they must give their legislative bodies something more\r\nand better to do, or else they must arrange so that these bodies will\r\nhave a chance to perform an inferior but definite service more capably.\r\n\r\nThe legislatures have been corrupt and incapable, chiefly because they\r\nhave not been permitted any sufficient responsibility, but this\r\nirresponsibility itself has had more than one cause. It cannot be traced\r\nexclusively to the diminished confidence and power reposed in\r\nrepresentative bodies by the state constitutions. Early in the\r\nnineteenth century, the legislatures were granted almost full\r\nlegislative powers; and if they did not use those powers well, they used\r\nthem much better than at a later period. Their corruption began with the\r\ndomination of the political machine; and it is during the last two\r\ngenerations that their powers and responsibilities have been more and\r\nmore restricted. They have undoubtedly been more corrupt and incompetent\r\nin proportion as they have been increasingly deprived of power; but the\r\nrestrictions imposed upon them have been as much an effect as a cause of\r\ntheir corruption. There is a deeper reason for their deficiencies; and\r\nthis reason is connected with mal-adaptation of the whole system of\r\nAmerican state government to its place in a Federal system. The Federal\r\norganization took away from the states a number of the most important\r\ngovernmental functions, and in certain respects absolutely subordinated\r\nthe state to the nation. In this way the actual responsibilities and the\r\npowers of the state governments were very much diminished, while at the\r\nsame time no sufficient allowance for such a diminution was made in\r\nframing their organization. Their governments were organized along the\r\nsame lines as that of an independent state--in spite of the fact that\r\nthey had abandoned so many of the responsibilities and prerogatives of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this mal-adaptation of the state political institutions to\r\ntheir place in a Federal system has been much more important than is\r\nusually supposed. The former were planned to fulfill a much completer\r\nresponsibility than the one which they actually possessed. The public\r\nbusiness of a wholly or technically independent state naturally arouses\r\nin its citizens a much graver sense of responsibility than does the\r\npublic business of a state in the American Union. The latter retained\r\nmany important duties; but it surrendered, if not the most essential of\r\nits functions, at least the most critical and momentous, while in the\r\nexercise of the remainder it was to a certain extent protected against\r\nthe worst consequences of mistakes or perversities. It surrendered the\r\npower of making peace or declaring war. Its relation to the other states\r\nin the Union was strictly defined, so that it had no foreign policy and\r\nresponsibilities corresponding to its purely domestic ones. Its citizens\r\nwere aware that the protection of such fundamental institutions as that\r\nof private property was lodged in the Federal government, and that in\r\nthe end that government had the power to guarantee them even against the\r\nworst consequences of domestic disorder. Thus the state governments were\r\nplaced in the easy situation of rich annuitants, who had surrendered the\r\ncontrol of some political capital in order to enjoy with less care the\r\nopportunities of a plethoric income.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing comment is not intended as any disparagement of a Federal\r\nas contrasted with a centralized political system. Its purpose is to\r\njustify the statement that, in a Federal system, local political\r\ninstitutions should be adapted to their necessarily restricted\r\nfunctions. The state governments were organized as smaller copies of the\r\ncentral government, and the only alterations in the type permitted by\r\nthe Democrats looked in the direction of a further distribution of\r\nresponsibility. But a system which was adapted to the comprehensive task\r\nof securing the welfare of a whole people might well fail as an engine\r\nof merely local government,--even though the local government retained\r\ncertain major political functions. As a matter of fact, such has been\r\nthe case. The system of a triple division of specific powers, each one\r\nof which was vigorous in its own sphere while at the same time checked\r\nand balanced by the other branches of the government, has certain\r\nadvantages and certain disadvantages. Its great advantage is its\r\ncomparative safety, because under it no one function of government can\r\nattain to any dangerous excess of power. Its great disadvantage consists\r\nin the division of responsibility among three independent departments,\r\nand the possibility that the public interest would suffer either from\r\nlack of coöperation or from actual conflicts. In the case of the general\r\ngovernment, the comparative safety of the system of checks and balances\r\nwas of paramount importance, because the despotic exercise of its vast\r\npowers would have wrecked the whole American political system. On the\r\nother hand, the disadvantages of such a system--its division of\r\nresponsibility and the possible lack of coöperation among the several\r\ndepartments--were mitigated to a considerable, if not to a sufficient,\r\nextent. National parties came into existence with the function of\r\nassuming a responsibility which no single group of Federal officials\r\npossessed; and in their management of national affairs, the partisan\r\nleaders were prompted by a certain amount of patriotism and interest in\r\nthe public welfare. Even at Washington the system works badly enough in\r\ncertain respects; but in general the dominant party can be held to a\r\nmeasure of responsibility; and effective coöperation is frequently\r\nobtained in matters of foreign policy and the like through the action of\r\npatriotic and disinterested motives.\r\n\r\nIn the state governments the advantages of a system of checks and\r\nbalances were of small importance, while its disadvantages were\r\nmagnified. The state governments had no reason to sacrifice concentrated\r\nefficiency to safety, because in a Federal organization the temporary\r\nexercise of arbitrary executive or legislative power in one locality\r\nwould not have entailed any irretrievable consequences, and could not\r\nimpair the fundamental integrity of the American system. But if a state\r\nhad less to lose from a betrayal by a legislature or an executive of a\r\nsubstantially complete responsibility for the public welfare, it was not\r\nprotected to the same extent as the central government against the\r\nabuses of a diffused responsibility. In the state capitals, as at\r\nWashington, the national parties did, indeed, make themselves\r\nresponsible for the management of public affairs and for the harmonious\r\ncoöperation of the executive and the legislature; but in their conduct\r\nof local business the national parties retained scarcely a vestige of\r\nnational patriotism. Their behavior was dictated by the most selfish\r\nfactional and personal motives. They did, indeed, secure the coöperation\r\nof the different branches of the government, but largely for corrupt or\r\nundesirable purposes; and after the work was done the real authors of it\r\ncould hide behind the official division of responsibility.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing analysis is correct, the partial failure of American\r\nstate governments is to be imputed chiefly to their lack of a\r\ncentralized responsible organization. In their case a very simple and\r\nvery efficient legislative and administrative system is the more\r\nnecessary, because only through such a machinery can the local public\r\nspirit receive any effective expression. It can hardly be expected that\r\nAmerican citizens will bring as much public spirit to their local public\r\nbusiness as to the more stirring affairs of the whole nation; and what\r\nlocal patriotism there is should be confronted by no unnecessary\r\nobstacles. If a mistake or an abuse occurs, the responsibility for it\r\nshould be unmistakable and absolute, while if a reform candidate or\r\nparty is victorious, they should control a machinery of government\r\nwholly sufficient for their purposes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as any attempt is made to devise a system which does concentrate\r\nresponsibility and power, serious difficulties are encountered.\r\nConcentration of responsibility can be brought about in one of two\r\nways--either by subordinating the legislature to the executive or the\r\nexecutive to the legislature. There are precedents both here and abroad\r\nin favor of each of these methods, and their comparative advantages must\r\nbe briefly sketched.\r\n\r\nThe subordination of the executive to the legislature would conform to\r\nthe early American political tradition. We have usually associated\r\nexecutive authority with arbitrary and despotic political methods, and\r\nwe have tended to assume that a legislative body was much more\r\nrepresentative of popular opinion. During or immediately succeeding the\r\nRevolutionary War, the legislatures of the several states were endowed\r\nwith almost complete control--a control which was subject only to the\r\nconstitutional bills of rights; and it has been seriously and frequently\r\nproposed to revive this complete legislative responsibility. Under such\r\na system, the legislature would elect the chief executive, if not the\r\njudicial officials; and it would become like the British Parliament\r\nexclusively and comprehensively responsible for the work of\r\ngovernment--both in its legislative and administrative branches.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing type of organization has so many theoretical advantages\r\nthat one would like to see it tried in some American states. But for the\r\npresent it is not likely to be tried. The responsibility of the\r\nlegislature could not be exercised without the creation of some\r\ninstitution corresponding to the British Cabinet: and the whole tendency\r\nof American political development has been away from any approach to the\r\nEnglish Parliamentary system. Whatever the theoretical advantages of\r\nlegislative omnipotence, it would constitute in this country a dangerous\r\nand dubious method of concentrating local governmental responsibility\r\nand power. It might succeed, in case it were accompanied by the adoption\r\nof some effective measures for improving the quality of the\r\nrepresentation--such, for instance, as the abandonment of all existing\r\ntraditions necessitating the residence of the representative in the\r\ndistrict he represents. This American political practice always has and\r\nalways will tend to give mediocrity to the American popular\r\nrepresentation, but it corresponds to one of the most fundamental of\r\nAmerican political prejudices, and for the present its abandonment is\r\nout of the question. The work of improving the quality of the average\r\nAmerican representative from a small district appears to be hopeless,\r\nbecause as a matter of fact such small districts and the work imposed on\r\ntheir representatives can hardly prove tempting to able men; and unless\r\nthe American legislator is really capable of becoming exceptionally\r\nrepresentative, the fastening of exclusive responsibility upon the state\r\nlegislatures could hardly result in immediate success. Its intrinsic\r\nmerits might carry it to ultimate success, but not until it had\r\ntransformed many American political practices and traditions.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that certain very deep and permanent causes underlie\r\nAmerican legislative degeneracy. When the American legislative system\r\nwas framed, a representative assembly possessed a much better chance\r\nthan it does now of becoming a really representative body. It\r\nconstituted at the time an effective vehicle for the formation and\r\nexpression of public opinion. Public questions had not received the\r\ncomplete ventilation on the platform and in the press that they obtain\r\nat the present time; and in the debate of a representative assembly the\r\nchance existed of a really illuminating and formative conflict of\r\nopinion. Representatives were often selected, who were capable of adding\r\nsomething to the candid and serious consideration of a question of\r\npublic policy. The need helped to develop men capable of meeting it.\r\nNow, however, American legislatures, with the partial exception of the\r\nFederal Senate, have ceased to be deliberative bodies. Public questions\r\nreceive their effective discussion in the press and on the platform.\r\nPublic opinion is definitely formed before the meeting of the\r\nlegislature; and the latter has become simply a vehicle for realizing or\r\nbetraying the mandates of popular opinion. Its function is or should be\r\nto devise or to help in the devising of means, necessary to accomplish a\r\npredetermined policy. Its members have little or no initiative and\r\nlittle or no independence. Legislative projects are imposed upon them\r\neither by party leaders, by special interests, or at times by the\r\nexecutive and public opinion. Their work is at best that of\r\ncommittee-men and at worst that of mercenaries, paid to betray their\r\noriginal employers. A successful attempt to bestow upon legislative\r\nbodies, composed of such doubtful material and subject to such equivocal\r\ntraditions anything resembling complete governmental responsibility,\r\nwould be a dangerous business. Legislatures have degenerated into the\r\ncondition of being merely agents, rather than principals in the work of\r\ngovernment; and the strength and the propriety of the contemporary\r\nmovement in favor of the initiative and the referendum is to be\r\nattributed to this condition.\r\n\r\nThe increasing introduction of the referendum into the local political\r\norganization is partly a recognition of the fact that the legislatures\r\nhave ceased to play an independent part in the work of government. There\r\nis every reason to believe that hereafter the voters will obtain and\r\nkeep a much more complete and direct control over the making of their\r\nlaws than that which they have exerted hitherto; and the possible\r\ndesirability of the direct exercise of this function cannot be disputed\r\nby any loyal democrat. The principle upon which the referendum is based\r\nis unimpeachable; but a question remains as to the manner in which the\r\nprinciple of direct legislation can be best embodied in a piece of\r\npractical political machinery; and the attempt to solve this question\r\ninvolves a consideration of the general changes in our system of local\r\ngovernment, which may be required, as a result of the application of the\r\nnew principle.\r\n\r\nThe necessary limits of this discussion forbid any exhaustive\r\nconsideration of the foregoing questions; and I must content myself with\r\na brief summary of the method in which the principle of direct\r\nlegislation can be made the part of an efficient local political system.\r\nThe difficulty is to find some means of distinguishing that part of the\r\nlegislative responsibility which should be retained by the people and\r\nthat part which, in order to be effectively redeemed, must be delegated.\r\nObviously the part to be retained is the function of accepting or\r\nrejecting certain general proposals respecting state organization or\r\npolicy. An American electorate is or should be entirely competent to\r\ndecide whether in general it wishes gambling or the sale of intoxicating\r\nliquors to be suppressed, whether it is willing or unwilling to delegate\r\nlarge judicial and legislative authority to commissions, or whether it\r\nwishes to exempt buildings from local taxation. In retaining the power\r\nof deciding for itself these broad questions of public legislative\r\npolicy, it is exercising a function, adapted to the popular intelligence\r\nand both disciplinary and formative in its effect on those who take the\r\nresponsibility seriously. Under any system of popular government--even\r\nunder a parliamentary system--such general questions are eventually\r\nsubmitted to popular decision; and the more decisively they can be\r\nsubmitted, the better. On the other hand, there is a large part of the\r\nwork of government, which must be delegated by the people to select\r\nindividuals, because it can be efficiently exercised only by peculiarly\r\nexperienced or competent men. The people are capable of passing upon the\r\ngeneral principle embodied in a proposed law; but they cannot be\r\nexpected to decide with any certainty of judgment about amendments or\r\ndetails, which involve for their intelligent consideration technical and\r\nspecial knowledge. Efficient law-making is as much a matter of\r\nwell-prepared and well-tempered detail as it is of an excellent general\r\nprinciple, and this branch of legislation must necessarily be left to\r\nexperts selected in one way or another to represent the popular\r\ninterest. How can they best be selected and what should be their\r\nfunctions?\r\n\r\nAn answer to these questions involves a consideration of the changes\r\nwhich the referendum should bring with it in the whole system of local\r\ngovernment--an aspect of the matter which according to the usual\r\nAmerican habit has hitherto been neglected. In states like Oregon the\r\npower of initiating and consummating legislation is bestowed on the\r\nelectorate without being taken away from the legislature; and a certain\r\nshare of necessary political business is left to a body which has been\r\nexpressly declared unworthy to exercise a more important share of the\r\nsame task. A legislative body, whose responsibilities and power are\r\nstill further reduced, will probably exercise their remaining functions\r\nwith even greater incompetence, and will, if possible, be composed of a\r\nstill more inferior class of legislative agents. If the legislature is\r\nto perform the inferior but still necessary functions that will\r\nnecessarily remain in its hands, an attempt should certainly be made to\r\nobtain a better quality of representation. No direct system of state\r\ngovernment can constitute any really substantial improvement on the\r\nexisting system, unless either the legislature is deprived of all really\r\nessential functions, or the quality of its membership improved.\r\n\r\nThe legislature, or some representative body corresponding to it,\r\ncannot, however, be deprived of certain really essential functions. The\r\ntask of preparing legislation for reference to the people, so that a\r\nquestion of public policy will be submitted in a decisive and acceptable\r\nform, belongs naturally to a representative body; and the same statement\r\nis true respecting the legislative work essential to the administration\r\nof a state's business affairs. The supply bills demand an amount of\r\ninspection in detail, which can obtain only by expert supervision; and\r\nso it is in respect to various minor legislative matters which do not\r\nraise question of general policy but which amount to little more than\r\nproblems of local administrative detail. A representative body must be\r\nprovided which shall perform work of this kind; and again, it must be\r\nsaid that existing legislatures would perform these more restricted\r\nfunctions even worse than they have performed a completer legislative\r\nduty. Their members are experts in nothing but petty local politics.\r\nThey are usually wholly incapable of drawing a bill, or of passing\r\nintelligently on matters either of technical or financial detail. If\r\nthey represent anything, it is the interest of their district rather\r\nthan that of the state. The principle of direct legislation, in order to\r\nbecome really constructive, must bring with it a more effective\r\nauxiliary machinery than any which existing legislatures can supply.\r\n\r\nThe kind of machinery needed can be deduced from the character of the\r\nwork. The function of the representative body, needed under a system of\r\ndirect legislation, is substantially that of a legislative and\r\nadministrative council or commission. It should be an experienced body\r\nof legal, administrative, and financial experts, comparatively limited\r\nin numbers, and selected in a manner to make them solicitous of the\r\ninterests of the whole state. They should be elected, consequently, from\r\ncomparatively large districts, or, if possible, by the electorate of the\r\nwhole state under some system of cumulative voting. The work of such a\r\ncouncil would not be in any real sense legislative; and its creation\r\nwould simply constitute a candid recognition of the plain fact that our\r\nexisting legislatures, either with or without the referendum, no longer\r\nperform a responsible legislative function. It would be tantamount to a\r\nscientific organization of the legislative committees, which at the\r\npresent time exercise an efficient control over the so-called\r\nlegislative output. This council would mediate between the governor,\r\nwho administered the laws, and the people, who enacted them. It would\r\nconstitute a check upon the governor, and would in turn be checked by\r\nhim; while it would act in relation to the people as a sort of technical\r\nadvisory commission, with the duty of preparing legislation for popular\r\nenactment or rejection.\r\n\r\nBut how would such specific legislative proposals originate? Before\r\nanswering this question let us consider how important bills actually\r\noriginate under the existing system. They are in almost every case\r\nimposed upon the legislature by some outside influence. Sometimes they\r\nare prepared by corporation lawyers and are introduced by the special\r\ncorporation representatives. Sometimes they originate with the party\r\n\"bosses,\" and are intended to promote some more or less important\r\npartisan purpose. Sometimes they are drawn by associations of reformers,\r\nand go to the legislature with whatever support from public opinion the\r\nassociation can collect. Finally, they are frequently introduced at the\r\nsuggestion of the governor; and of late years during the growth of the\r\nreform movement, the executive has in point of fact become more and more\r\nresponsible for imposing on the legislature laws desired or supposed to\r\nbe desired by the electorate. Of these different sources of existing\r\nlegislation, the last suggests a manner of initiating legislation, which\r\nis most likely to make for the efficient concentration of governmental\r\nresponsibility. The governor should be empowered not merely to suggest\r\nlegislation to the council, but to introduce it into the council. His\r\nright to introduce legislation need not be exclusive, but bills\r\nintroduced by him should have a certain precedence and their\r\nconsideration should claim a definite amount of the council's time. The\r\ncouncil would possess, of course, full right of rejection or amendment.\r\nIn the case of rejection or an amendment not acceptable to the governor\r\nthe question at issue would be submitted to popular vote.\r\n\r\nThe method of originating legislation suggested above is, of course,\r\nentirely different from that ordinarily associated with the referendum.\r\nAccording to the usual methods of direct legislation, any body of\r\nelectors of a certain size can effect the introduction of a bill and its\r\nsubmission to popular vote; but a method of this kind is really no\r\nmethod at all. It allows the electorate to be bombarded with a\r\nsuccession of legislative proposals, turning perhaps on radical\r\nquestions of public policy like the single tax, which may be well or ill\r\ndrawn, which may or may not be living questions of the day, which may or\r\nmay not have received sufficient preparatory discussion, and which would\r\nkeep public opinion in a wholly unnecessary condition of ferment. Some\r\norganized control over the legislative proposals submitted to popular\r\napproval is absolutely necessary; and the sort of control suggested\r\nabove merely conforms to the existing unofficial practice of those\r\nstates wherein public opinion has been aroused. The best reform\r\nlegislation now enacted usually originates in executive mansions. Why\r\nshould not the practice be made official? If it were so, every candidate\r\nfor governor would have to announce either a definite legislative policy\r\nor the lack of one; and the various items composing this policy would be\r\nfully discussed during the campaign. In proposing such a policy the\r\ngovernor would be held to a high sense of responsibility. He could not\r\nescape from the penalties of an unwise, an ill-drawn, or a foolhardy\r\nlegislative proposal. At the same time he would be obliged constantly to\r\nmeet severe criticism both as to the principle and details of his\r\nmeasures on the part of the legislative council. Such criticism would\r\nfasten upon any weakness and would sufficiently protect the public\r\nagainst the submission of unnecessary, foolish, or dangerous legislative\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\nI am aware, of course, that the plan of legislative organization,\r\nvaguely sketched above, will seem to be most dubious to the great\r\nmajority of Americans, intelligently interested in political matters;\r\nbut before absolutely condemning these suggestions as wild or dangerous,\r\nthe reader should consider the spirit in which and the purpose for which\r\nthey are made. My intention has not been to prepare a detailed plan of\r\nlocal governmental organization and to stamp it as the only one, which\r\nis correct in principle and coherent in detail. In a sense I care\r\nnothing about the precise suggestions submitted in the preceding\r\nparagraphs. They are offered, not as a definite plan of local political\r\norganization, but as the illustration of a principle. The principle is\r\nthat both power and responsibility in affairs of local government should\r\nbe peculiarly concentrated. It cannot be concentrated without some\r\nsimplification of machinery and without giving either the legislature or\r\nthe executive a dominant authority. In the foregoing plan the executive\r\nhas been made dominant, because as a matter of fact recent political\r\nexperience has conclusively proved that the executives, elected by the\r\nwhole constituency, are much more representative of public opinion than\r\nare the delegates of petty districts. One hundred district agents\r\nrepresent only one hundred districts and not the whole state, or the\r\nstate in so far as it is whole. In the light of current American\r\npolitical realities the executive deserves the greater share of\r\nresponsibility and power; and that is why the proposal is made to bestow\r\nit on him. The other details of the foregoing plan have been proposed in\r\na similar spirit. They are innovations; but they are innovations which\r\nmay naturally (and perhaps should) result from certain living practices\r\nand movements in American local politics. They merely constitute an\r\nattempt to give those ideas and practices candid recognition. No such\r\nreorganization may ever be reached in American local government; and I\r\nmay have made essential mistakes in estimating the real force of certain\r\ncurrent practices and the real value of certain remedial expedients. But\r\non two points the argument admits of no concession. Any practical scheme\r\nof local institutional reform must be based on the principle of more\r\nconcentrated responsibility and power, and it must be reached by\r\nsuccessive experimental attempts to give a more consistent and efficient\r\nform to actual American political practices.\r\n\r\nThe bestowal upon an executive of increased official responsibility and\r\npower will be stigmatized by \"old-fashioned Democrats\" as dangerously\r\ndespotic; and it may be admitted that in the case of the central\r\ngovernment, any official increase of executive power might bring with it\r\nthe risk of usurpation. The Constitution of the United States has made\r\nthe President a much more responsible and vigorous executive in his own\r\nsphere of action than are the governors of the several states in theirs;\r\nand he can with his present power exercise a tolerably effective control\r\nover legislation. But the states, for reasons already given, are\r\nprotected against the worst possible consequences of illegal usurpation;\r\nand in any event the people, in case their interests were threatened,\r\ncould make use of a simple and absolutely effective remedy. The action\r\nof the governor or of any member of the legislative council could be\r\nchallenged by the application of the recall. He could be made to prove\r\nhis loyalty to the Constitution and to the public interest by the\r\nholding of a special election at the instance of a sufficient number of\r\nvoters; and if he could not justify any possibly dubious practices, he\r\ncould be displaced and replaced. The recall is for this purpose a useful\r\nand legitimate political device. It has the appearance at the first\r\nglance of depriving an elected official of the sense of independence and\r\nsecurity which he may derive from his term of office; and unquestionably\r\nif applied to officials who served for very short terms and exercised no\r\neffective responsibility during service it would deprive them of what\r\nlittle power of public service they possessed. On the other hand, it is\r\nright that really responsible and vigorous officials serving for\r\ncomparatively long terms should be subjected to the check of a possible\r\nrecall of the popular trust.\r\n\r\nNo plan of political organization can in the nature of things offer an\r\nabsolute guarantee that a government will not misuse its powers; but a\r\ngovernment of the kind suggested, should it prove to be either corrupt\r\nor incompetent, could remain in control only by the express acquiescence\r\nof the electorate. Its corruption and incompetence could not be\r\nconcealed, and would inevitably entail serious consequences. On the\r\nother hand, the results of any peculiar efficiency and political wisdom\r\nwould be equally conspicuous. Men of integrity, force, and ability would\r\nbe tempted to run for office by the stimulating opportunity offered for\r\neffective achievement. Such a government would, consequently press into\r\nits service whatever public-spirited and energetic men the community\r\npossessed; and it would represent not an inferior or even an average\r\nstandard public opinion and ideas, but the highest standard which the\r\npeople could be made to accept. Provided only the voters themselves were\r\non the whole patriotic, well-intentioned, and loyal, it would be bound\r\nto make not for a stagnant routine, but for a gradually higher level of\r\nlocal political action.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSTATE ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM\r\n\r\nThe foregoing discussion of the means which may be taken to make\r\nAmerican local governments more alive to their responsibilities has been\r\nconfined to the department of legislation. The department of\r\nadministration is, however, almost equally important; and some attempt\r\nmust be made to associate with a reform of the local legislature a\r\nreform of the local administration. The questions of administrative\r\nefficiency and the best method of obtaining it demand special and\r\ndetailed consideration. In this case the conclusions reached will apply\r\nas much to the central and municipal as they do to the state\r\nadministrations; but the whole matter of administrative efficiency can\r\nbe most conveniently discussed in relation to the proper organization of\r\na state government. The false ideas and practices which have caused so\r\nmuch American administrative inefficiency originated in the states and\r\nthence infected the central government. On the other hand, the reform of\r\nthese practices made its first conquests at Washington and thereafter\r\nwas languidly and indifferently taken over by many of the states. The\r\nstate politicians have never adopted it in good faith, because real\r\nadministrative efficiency would, by virtue of the means necessarily\r\ntaken to accomplish it, undermine the stability of the political\r\nmachine. The power of the machine can never be broken without a complete\r\nreform of our local administrative systems; and the discussion of that\r\nreform is more helpful in relation to the state than in relation to the\r\ncentral government.\r\n\r\nCivil service reform was the very first movement of the kind to make any\r\nheadway in American politics. Within a few years after the close of the\r\nWar it had waxed into an issue which the politicians could not ignore;\r\nand while its first substantial triumph was postponed until late in the\r\nseventies, it has, on the whole, been more completely accepted than any\r\nimportant reforming idea. It has secured the energetic support of every\r\nPresident during the last twenty-five years; it has received at all\r\nevents the verbal homage of the two national parties; and it can point\r\nto affirmative legislation in the great majority of the states. It meets\r\nat the present time with practically no open and influential opposition.\r\nNevertheless, the \"merit system\" has not met the expectations of its\r\nmost enthusiastic supporters. Abuses have been abolished wherever the\r\nreform has been introduced, but the abolition of abuses has not made for\r\nany marked increase of efficiency. The civil service is still very far\r\nfrom being in a satisfactory condition either in the central, state, or\r\nmunicipal offices. Moreover, the passage of reform laws has not had any\r\nappreciable effect upon the vitality or the power of the professional\r\npolitician. The machine has, on the whole, increased rather than\r\ndiminished in power, during the past twenty-five years. Civil service\r\nreform is no longer as vigorously opposed as it used to be, because it\r\nis no longer feared. The politicians have found that in its ordinary\r\nshape it really does not do them any essential harm. The consequence is\r\nthat the agitation has drifted to the rear of the American political\r\nbattle, and fails to excite either the enthusiasm, the enmity, or the\r\ninterest that it did fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nIts partial failure has been due to the fact that the reformers merely\r\nattacked one of the symptoms of a disease which was more deeply rooted\r\nand more virulent than they supposed. They were outraged by the\r\nappointment of administrative officials solely as a reward for partisan\r\nservice and without reference to their qualifications for their official\r\nduties; and two means were devised to strike at this abuse. Lower\r\nadministrative officials were protected in their positions by depriving\r\ntheir superiors of the power of removing them except for cause; and it\r\nwas provided that new appointments should be made from lists of\r\ncandidates whose eligibility was guaranteed by their ability to pass\r\nexaminations in subjects connected with the work of the office. These\r\nwere undoubtedly steps in a better direction; but they have failed to be\r\neffective, because the attempt to secure a more meritorious selection of\r\npublic servants was not applied to higher grades of the service. At the\r\nhead of every public office was a man who had been appointed or elected\r\nchiefly for partisan reasons; who served only for a short time; who\r\ncould become familiar with the work of his office, if at all, only\r\nslowly; and who, because of his desire to be surrounded by his own\r\nhenchmen, was the possible enemy of the permanent staff. The civil\r\nservice laws have been designed, consequently, to a very considerable\r\nextent for the purpose of protecting the subordinates against their\r\nchiefs; and that is scarcely to be conceived as a method of organizing\r\nadministrative employees helpful to administrative efficiency. The\r\nchiefs were allowed comparatively little effective authority over their\r\nsubordinates, and subordinates could not be held to any effective\r\nresponsibility. A premium was placed upon ordinary routine work which\r\nobserved carefully all the official forms, but which was calculated with\r\nequal care not to task its perpetrators.\r\n\r\nThe American civil service will never be really reformed by the sort of\r\ncivil service laws which have hitherto been passed--no matter how\r\nfaithfully those laws may be executed. The only way in which\r\nadministrative efficiency can be secured is by means of an organization\r\nwhich makes a departmental chief absolutely responsible for energetic\r\nwork and economical administration in his office; and no such\r\nresponsibility can exist as long as his subordinates are independent of\r\nhim. He need not necessarily have the power to discharge his\r\nsubordinates, except with the consent of a Board of Inspectors; but he\r\nshould have the power to promote them to positions of greater\r\nresponsibility and income, or to degrade them to comparatively\r\ninsignificant positions. Efficiency cannot be secured in any other way,\r\nbecause no executive official can be held accountable for good work\r\nunless his control over his subordinates is effective. So far as the\r\nexisting civil service laws in city, state, and the United States fail\r\nto bestow full responsibility, coupled with sufficient authority, upon\r\ndepartmental chiefs, they should be altered; and their alteration should\r\nbe made part of any plan of constructive reform in the civil service.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of departmental chiefs and their effective authority\r\nover their subordinates necessarily imply changes in the current methods\r\nof selecting these officials. The prevailing methods are unwise and\r\nchaotic. In some cases they are appointed by the chief executive. In\r\nother cases they are elected. But whether appointed or elected, they are\r\nselected chiefly for partisan service. They hold office only for a few\r\nyears. They rarely have any particular qualification for their work.\r\nThey cannot be expected either to take very much interest in their\r\nofficial duties or use their powers in an efficient manner. To give such\r\ntemporary officeholders a large measure of authority over their\r\nsubordinates would mean in the long run that such authority would be\r\nused chiefly for political purposes. Administrative efficiency,\r\nconsequently, can only be secured by the adoption of a method of\r\nselecting departmental chiefs which will tend to make them expert public\r\nservants rather than politicians. They must be divorced from political\r\nassociations. They must be emancipated from political vicissitudes. The\r\nsuccess of their career must depend exclusively upon the excellence of\r\ntheir departmental work.\r\n\r\nAs long as these public servants are elected, no such result can be\r\nexpected. The practice of electing the incumbents of subordinate\r\nexecutive positions inevitably invites the evasion of responsibility and\r\nthe selection of the candidate chiefly for partisan service. When such a\r\nman stands for renomination or reëlection, his administrative efficiency\r\nor inefficiency (unless the latter should chance to be particularly\r\nflagrant) does not affect his chances. He is renominated in case he has\r\nserved his party well, or in case no one else who wants the job has in\r\nthe meantime served it better. He is reëlected in case his party happens\r\nto have kept public confidence. Departmental chiefs can be made\r\nresponsible for their work only by being subordinated to a chief\r\nexecutive whose duty it is to keep his eye on his subordinates and who\r\nis accountable to the people for the efficient conduct of all the\r\nadministrative offices. The former, consequently, must be selected by\r\nappointment, they must be installed in office for an indefinite period,\r\nand they must be subject to removal by the chief executive. Those are\r\nterms upon which all private employees serve; and on no other terms will\r\nequally efficient results be obtained from public officials.\r\n\r\nUnder a democratic political system there is, of course, no way of\r\nabsolutely guaranteeing that any method of administrative organization,\r\nhowever excellent in itself, will accomplish the desired and the\r\ndesirable result. Administrative authority must at some point always\r\noriginate in an election. The election can delegate power only for a\r\nlimited period. At the end of the limited period another executive will\r\nbe chosen--possibly a man representing a wholly different political\r\npolicy. Such a man will want his immediate advisers to share his\r\npolitical point of view; and it is always possible that in electing him\r\nthe voters will make a mistake and choose an incompetent and\r\nirresponsible person. An incompetent or disloyal executive could\r\nundoubtedly under such a system do much to disorganize the public\r\nservice; but what will you have? There can be no efficiency without\r\nresponsibility. There can be no responsibility without authority. The\r\nauthority and responsibility residing ultimately in the people must be\r\ndelegated; and it must not be emasculated in the process of delegation.\r\nIf it is abused, the people should at all events be able to fix the\r\noffense and to punish the offender. At present our administration is\r\norganized chiefly upon the principle that the executive shall not be\r\npermitted to do much good for fear that he will do harm. It ought to be\r\norganized on the principle that he shall have full power to do either\r\nwell or ill, but that if he does do ill, he will have no defense against\r\npunishment. The principle is the same as it is in the case of\r\nlegislative responsibility. If under those conditions the voters should\r\npersist in electing incompetent or corrupt executives, they would\r\ndeserve the sort of government they would get and would probably in the\r\nend be deprived of their vote.\r\n\r\nA system of local government, designed for concentrating power and\r\nresponsibility, might, consequently, be shaped along the following\r\ngeneral lines. Its core would be a chief executive, elected for a\r\ncomparatively long term, and subject to recall under certain defined\r\nconditions. He would be surrounded by an executive council, similar to\r\nthe President's Cabinet, appointed by himself and consisting of a\r\nController, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Commissioner of Public\r\nWorks, and the like. So far his position would not differ radically from\r\nthat of the President of the United States, except that he would be\r\nsubject to recall. But he would have the additional power of introducing\r\nlegislation into a legislative council and, in case his proposed\r\nlegislation were rejected or amended in an inacceptable manner, of\r\nappealing to the electorate. The legislative council would be elected\r\nfrom large districts and, if possible, by some cumulative system of\r\nvoting. They, also, might be subject to recall. They would have the\r\npower, dependent on the governor's veto, of authorizing the\r\nappropriation of public money and, also, of passing on certain minor\r\nclasses of legislation--closely associated with administrative\r\nfunctions. But in relation to all legislation of substantial importance\r\nexpress popular approval would be necessary. The chief executive should\r\npossess the power of removing any administrative official in the employ\r\nof the state and of appointing a successor. He would be expected to\r\nchoose an executive council who agreed with him in all essential matters\r\nof public policy, just as the President is expected to appoint his\r\nCabinet. His several councilors would be executive officials,\r\nresponsible for particular departments of the public service; but they\r\nwould exercise their authority through permanent departmental\r\nchiefs--just as the Secretary of War delegates much of his authority to\r\na chief of staff, or an English minister to a permanent under-secretary.\r\nThe system could offer no guarantee that the subordinate departmental\r\nchiefs would be absolutely permanent; but at all events they would not\r\nbe changed at fixed periods or for irrelevant reasons. They would be\r\njust as permanent or as transient as the good of the service demanded.\r\nIn so far, that is, as the system was carried out in good faith they\r\nwould be experts, absolutely the masters of the technical business of\r\nthe offices and of the abilities and services of their subordinates. The\r\nweak point in such administrative organization is undoubtedly the\r\nrelation between the members of the governor's council and their chiefs\r\nof staff; but there must be a weak link in any organization which seeks\r\nto convert the changing views of public policy, dependent upon an\r\nelection, into responsible, efficient, and detailed administrative acts.\r\nIf the system were not accepted in good faith, if in the long run it\r\nwere not carried out by officials, who were disinterestedly and\r\nintelligently working in the public interest, it would be bound to fail;\r\nbut so would any method of political organization. This particular plan\r\nsimply embodies the principle that the way to get good public service\r\nout of men is to give them a sufficient chance.\r\n\r\nUnder the proposed system the only powers possessed by the state\r\nexecutive, not now bestowed upon the President of the United States,\r\nwould consist in an express and an effective control over legislation.\r\nIt would be his duty to introduce legislation whenever it was in his\r\nopinion desirable; and in case his bills were amended to death or\r\nrejected, it would be his right to appeal to the people. He would, in\r\naddition, appoint all state officials except the legislative council,\r\nand perhaps the judges of the highest court. On the other hand, he would\r\nbe limited by the recall and he could not get any important legislative\r\nmeasure on the statute books except after severe technical criticism,\r\nand express popular consent. He could accomplish nothing without the\r\nsupport of public opinion; yet he could be held absolutely responsible\r\nfor the good government of the state. A demagogue elected to a position\r\nof such power and responsibility might do a great deal of harm; but if a\r\ndemocratic political body cannot distinguish between the leadership of\r\nable and disinterested men and self-seeking charlatans, the loss and\r\nperhaps the suffering, resulting from their indiscriminate blindness,\r\nwould constitute a desirable means of political education,--particularly\r\nwhen the demagogue, as in the case under consideration, could not really\r\ndamage the foundations of the state. And the charlatan or the\r\nincompetent could be sent into retreat just as soon as exposed. The\r\ndanger not only has a salutary aspect, but it seems a small price to pay\r\nfor the chance, thereby afforded, for really efficient and responsible\r\ngovernment. The chief executive, when supported by public opinion, would\r\nbecome a veritable \"Boss\"; and he would inevitably be the sworn enemy of\r\nunofficial \"Bosses\" who now dominate local politics. He would have the\r\npower to purify American local politics, and this power he would be\r\nobliged to use. The logic of his whole position would convert him into\r\nan enemy of the machine, in so far as the machine was using any\r\ngovernmental function for private, special, or partisan purposes. The\r\nreal \"Boss\" would destroy the sham \"Bosses\"; and no other means, as yet\r\nsuggested, will, I believe, be sufficient to accomplish such a result.\r\n\r\nAfter the creation of such a system of local government the power of the\r\nprofessional politician would not last a year longer than the people\r\nwanted it to last. The governor would control the distribution of all\r\nthose fruits of the administrative and legislative system upon which the\r\nmachine has lived. There could be no trafficking in offices, in public\r\ncontracts, or in legislation; and the man who wished to serve the state\r\nunofficially would have to do so from disinterested motives. Moreover,\r\nthe professional politician could not only be destroyed, but he would\r\nnot be needed. At present he is needed, because of the prodigious amount\r\nof business entailed by the multiplicity of elective officials. Somebody\r\nmust take charge of this political detail; and it has, as we have\r\nalready remarked, drifted into the hands of specialists. These\r\nspecialists cannot be expected to serve for nothing. Their effort to\r\nconvert their work into a means of support is the source of the greater\r\npart of the petty American political corruption; and such corruption\r\nwill persist as long as any real need exists for the men who live upon\r\nit. The simplest way to dispense with the professional politician is to\r\ndispense with the service he performs. Reduce the number of elective\r\nofficials. Under the proposed method of organization the number of\r\nelections and the number of men to be elected would be comparatively\r\nfew. The voter would cast his ballot only for his local selectmen or\r\ncommissioners, a governor, one or more legislative councilmen, the\r\njustices of the state court of appeals, and his Federal congressman and\r\nexecutive. The professional politician would be left without a\r\nprofession. He would have to pass on his power to men who would be\r\nofficially designated to rule the people for a limited period, and who\r\ncould not escape full responsibility for their public performances.\r\n\r\nI have said that no less drastic plan of institutional reorganization\r\nwill be sufficient to accomplish the proposed result; and a brief\r\njustification must be afforded for this statement. It was expected, for\r\ninstance, that the secret Australian ballot would do much to undermine\r\nthe power of the professional politician. He would be prevented thereby\r\nfrom controlling his followers and, in case of electoral trades, from,\r\n\"delivering the goods.\" Well! the Australian ballot has been adopted\r\nmore or less completely in the majority of the states; and it has\r\nundoubtedly made open electoral corruption more difficult and less\r\ncommon than it once was. But it has not diminished the personal and\r\npartisan allegiance on which the power of the local \"Boss\" is based; and\r\nit has done the professional politician as little serious harm as have\r\nthe civil service laws. Neither can it be considered an ideal method of\r\nballoting for the citizens of a free democracy. Independent voting and\r\nthe splitting of tickets is essential to a wholesome expression of\r\npublic opinion; but in so far as such independence has to be purchased\r\nby secrecy its ultimate value may be doubted. American politics will\r\nnever be \"purified\" or its general standards improved by an independence\r\nwhich is afraid to come out into the open; and it is curious that with\r\nall the current talk about the wholesome effects of \"publicity\" the\r\nreformed ballot sends a voter sneaking into a closet in order to perform\r\nhis primary political duty. If American voters are more independent than\r\nthey used to be, it is not because they have been protected by the state\r\nagainst the penalties of independence, but because they have been\r\naroused to more independent thought and action by the intrusion and the\r\ndiscussion of momentous issues. In the long run that vote which is\r\nreally useful and significant is the vote cast in the open with a full\r\nsense of conviction and responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnother popular reforming device which belongs to the same class and\r\nwhich will fail to accomplish the expected result is the system of\r\ndirect primaries. It may well be that this device will in the long run\r\nmerely emphasize the evil which it is intended to abate. It will tend to\r\nperpetuate the power of the professional politician by making his\r\nservices still more necessary. Under it the number of elections will be\r\nvery much increased, and the amount of political business to be\r\ntransacted will grow in the same proportion. In one way or another the\r\nprofessional politician will transact this business; and in one way or\r\nanother he will make it pay. Under a system of direct primaries the\r\nmachine could not prevent the nomination of the popular candidate\r\nwhenever public opinion was aroused; so it is with the existing system.\r\nBut whenever public interest flags,--and it is bound to flag under such\r\nan absurd multiplication of elections and under such a complication of\r\nelectoral machinery,--the politicians can easily nominate their own\r\ncandidates. Up to date no method has been devised which would prevent\r\nthem from using their personal followers in the primary elections of\r\nboth parties; and no such method can be devised without enforcing some\r\ncomparatively fixed distinction between a Republican and a Democrat, and\r\nthus increasing the difficulties of independent voting. In case the\r\nnumber of elective officials were decreased, as has been proposed above,\r\nthere would be fewer objections to the direct primary. Under the\r\nsuggested method of organization each election would become of such\r\nimportance that public opinion would be awakened and would be likely to\r\nobtain effective expression; and the balloting for the party candidates\r\nwould arouse as much interest, particularly in the case of the dominant\r\nparty, as the final election itself. In fact, the danger would be under\r\nsuch circumstances that the primaries would arouse too much interest,\r\nand that the parties would become divided into embittered and\r\nunscrupulous factions. Genuinely patriotic and national parties may\r\nexist; but a genuinely patriotic faction within a party would be a\r\nplant of much rarer growth. From every point of view, consequently, the\r\ndirect primary has its doubtful aspects. The device is becoming so\r\npopular that it will probably prevail; and as it prevails, it may have\r\nthe indirect beneficial result of diminishing the number of regular\r\nelections; but at bottom it is a clumsy and mechanical device for the\r\nselection of party candidates. It is merely one of the many means\r\ngenerated by American political practice for cheapening the ballot. The\r\nway to make votes important and effective is not to increase but to\r\ndiminish their number.\r\n\r\nA democracy has no interest in making good government complicated,\r\ndifficult, and costly. It has, on the contrary, every interest in so\r\nsimplifying its machinery that only decisive decisions and choices are\r\nsubmitted to the voter. Every attempt should be made to arouse his\r\ninterest and to turn his public spirit to account; and for that reason\r\nit should not be fatigued by excessive demands and confused by\r\ncomplicated decisions. The cost of government in time, ability,\r\ntraining, and energy should fall not upon the followers but upon the\r\nleaders; and the latter should have every opportunity to make the\r\nexpenditure pay. Such is the object of the foregoing suggestions towards\r\nreconstruction which, radical as they may seem, have been suggested\r\nchiefly by an examination of the practical conditions of contemporary\r\nreform. Only by the adoption of some such plan can the reformers become\r\nsomething better than perpetual moral protestants who are fighting a\r\nbattle in which a victory may be less fruitful than defeat. As it is,\r\nthey are usually flourishing in the eyes of the American people a flask\r\nof virtue which, when it is uncorked, proves to be filled with oaths of\r\noffice. The reformers must put strong wine into their bottle. They must\r\nmake office-holding worth while by giving to the officeholders the power\r\nof effecting substantial public benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITIES OF EFFECTIVE STATE ACTION\r\n\r\nThe questions relating to the kind of reforms which these reorganized\r\nstate governments might and should attempt to bring about need not be\r\nconsidered in any detail. In the case of the states institutional\r\nreconstruction is necessarily prior to social reconstruction; and the\r\nobjects for which their improved powers can be best used need at present\r\nonly be indicated. These objects include, in fact, practically all the\r\nprimary benefits which a state ought to confer upon its citizens; and it\r\nis because the states have so largely failed to confer these primary\r\nbenefits that the reconstruction necessarily assumes a radical\r\ncomplexion. It is absurd to discuss American local governments as agents\r\nof individual and social amelioration until they begin to meet their\r\nmost essential and ordinary responsibilities in a more satisfactory\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the most essential function of all--that of\r\nmaintaining order. A state government which could not escape and had the\r\ncourage to meet its responsibilities would necessarily demand from the\r\npeople a police force which was really capable of keeping the peace. It\r\ncould not afford to rely upon local \"posses\" and the militia. It would\r\nneed a state constabulary, subject to its control and numerous enough\r\nfor all ordinary emergencies. Such bodies of state police, efficiently\r\nused, could not only prevent the lawlessness which frequently\r\naccompanies strikes, but it could gradually stamp out lynch law.\r\nLynching, which is the product of excited local feeling, will never be\r\nstopped by the sheriffs, because they are afraid of local public\r\nopinion. It will never be stopped by the militia, because the militia is\r\nslow to arrive and is frequently undisciplined. But it can be stopped by\r\na well-trained and well-disciplined state constabulary, which can be\r\nquickly concentrated, and which would be independent of merely local\r\npublic opinion. When other states besides Pennsylvania establish\r\nconstabularies, it will be an indication that they really want to keep\r\norder; and when the Southern states in particular organize forces of\r\nthis kind, there will be reason to believe that they really desire to do\r\njustice to the negro criminal and remove one of the ugliest aspects of\r\nthe race question.\r\n\r\nA well-informed state government would also necessarily recognize the\r\nintimate connection between the prevention of lynching and the speedy\r\nand certain administration of criminal justice. It would seek not merely\r\nto stamp out disorder, but to anticipate it by doing away with the\r\nsubstantial injustice wrought by the procedure of the great majority of\r\nAmerican criminal courts. It is unnecessary to dwell at any length upon\r\nthe work of reorganization which would confront a responsible state\r\ngovernment in relation to the punishment and the prevention of crime,\r\nbecause public opinion is becoming aroused to the dangers which threaten\r\nAmerican society from the escape of criminals and the lax and sluggish\r\nadministration of the criminal laws. But the remark must be made that\r\nour existing methods of framing, executing, and expounding criminal laws\r\nare merely an illustration of the extent to which the state governments,\r\nunder the influence of traditional legal and political preconceptions,\r\nhave subordinated the collective social interest to that of the possible\r\nindividual criminal; and no thorough-going reform will be possible until\r\nthese traditional preconceptions have themselves been abandoned, and a\r\nsystem substituted which makes the state the efficient friend of the\r\ncollective public interest and the selected individual.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that they use their increased powers more effectually\r\nfor the primary duty of keeping order, and administering civil and\r\ncriminal justice, reforming state governments could proceed to many\r\nadditional tasks. They could redeem very much better than they do their\r\nresponsibility to their wards--the insane and the convicted criminals.\r\nAt the present time some states have fairly satisfactory penitentiaries,\r\nreformatories, and insane asylums, while other states have utterly\r\nunsatisfactory ones; but in all the states both the machinery and the\r\nmanagement are capable of considerable improvement. The steady increase\r\nboth of crime and insanity is demanding the most serious consideration\r\nof the whole problem presented by social dereliction--particularly for\r\nthe purpose of separating out those criminals and feeble-minded people\r\nwho are capable of being restored to the class of useful citizens. In\r\nfact a really regenerated state government might even consider the\r\npossible means of preventing crime and insanity. It might have the\r\nhardihood to inquire whether the institution of marriage, which would\r\nremain under exclusive state protection, does not in its existing form\r\nhave something to do with the prevalence and increase of insanity and\r\ncrime; and it might conceivably reach the conclusion that the enforced\r\ncelibacy of hereditary criminals and incipient lunatics would make for\r\nindividual and social improvement even more than would a maximum\r\npassenger fare on the railroads of two cents a mile. Moreover, while\r\ntheir eyes were turned to our American success in increasing the social\r\nas well as the economic output, they might pause a moment to consider\r\nthe marvelous increase of divorces. They might reflect whether this\r\nincrease, like that of the criminals and the insane, did not afford a\r\npossible subject of legislation, but I doubt whether even a regenerate\r\nstate government would reach any very quick or satisfactory conclusions\r\nin respect to this matter. Public opinion does not appear to have\r\ndecided whether the social fact of divorce abounding is to be considered\r\nas an abuse or as a fulfillment of the existing institution of marriage.\r\n\r\nNeither need the pernicious activity of such a government cease, after\r\nit has succeeded in radically improving its treatment of the criminal\r\nand its lunatics, and in possibly doing something to make the American\r\nhome less precarious, if less cheerful. It might then turn its attention\r\nto the organization of labor, in relation to which, as we shall see\r\npresently, the states may have the opportunity for effective work. Or an\r\ninquiry might be made as to whether the educational system of the\r\ncountry, which should remain under exclusive state jurisdiction, is well\r\nadapted to the extremely complicated purpose of endowing its various\r\npupils with the general and special training most helpful to the\r\ncreation of genuine individuals, useful public servants, and loyal and\r\ncontented citizens of their own states. In this matter of education the\r\nstate governments, particularly in the North, have shown abundant and\r\nencouraging good will; but it is characteristic of their general\r\ninefficiency that a good will has found its expression in a\r\ncomparatively bad way.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no good purpose to push any farther the list of excellent\r\nobjects to which the state governments might devote their liberated and\r\nliberalized energies. We need only add that they would then be capable,\r\nnot merely of more efficient separate action, but also of far more\r\nprofitable coöperation. In case the states were emancipated from their\r\nexisting powerless subjection to individual, special, and parochial\r\ninterests, the advantages of a system of federated states would be\r\nimmediately raised to the limit. The various questions of social and\r\neducational reform can only be advanced towards a better understanding\r\nand perhaps a partial solution by a continual process of\r\nexperimentation--undertaken with the full appreciation that they were\r\ntentative and would be pushed further or withdrawn according to the\r\nnature of their results. Obviously a state government is a much better\r\npolitical agency for the making of such experiments than is a government\r\nwhose errors would affect the population of the whole country. No better\r\nmachinery for the accomplishment of a progressive programme of social\r\nreform could be advised than a collection of governments endowed with\r\nthe powers of an American state, and really desirous of advancing\r\nparticular social questions towards their solution. Such a system would\r\nbe flexible; it would provoke emulation; it would encourage initiative;\r\nand it would take advantage of local ebullitions of courage and insight\r\nand any peculiarly happy local collection of circumstances. Finally, if\r\nin addition to the merits of a system of generous competition, it could\r\nadd those of occasional consultation and coöperation, such as is implied\r\nby the proposed \"House of Governors,\" the organization for social reform\r\nwould leave little to be desired. The governors who would meet in\r\nconsultation would be the real political leaders of their several\r\nstates; and they should meet, not so much for the purpose of agreeing\r\nupon any single group of reforming measures, as for the purpose of\r\ncomparing notes obtained under widely different conditions and as the\r\nresult of different legislative experiments. Just in so far as this\r\nmixture of generous competition and candid coöperation was seeking to\r\naccomplish constructive social purposes, for which the powers of the\r\nstates, each within its geographical limits, were fully adequate, just\r\nto that extent it could hardly fail to make headway in the direction of\r\nsocial reform.\r\n\r\nIf the state governments are to reach their maximum usefulness in the\r\nAmerican political system, they must not only be self-denying in respect\r\nto the central government, but generous in respect to their\r\ncreatures--the municipal corporations. There are certain business and\r\nsocial questions of exclusively or chiefly local importance which should\r\nbe left to the municipal governments; and it is as characteristic of the\r\nunregenerate state governments of the past and the present that they\r\nhave interfered where they ought not to interfere as that they have not\r\ninterfered where they had an excellent opportunity for effective action.\r\nA politically regenerated state would guarantee in its constitution a\r\nmuch larger measure of home rule to the cities than they now enjoy,\r\nwhile at the same time the reformed legislative authority would endeavor\r\nto secure the edifying exercise of these larger powers, not by an\r\nembarrassing system of supervision, but by the concentration of the\r\nadministrative power and responsibility of the municipal authorities. I\r\nshall not attempt to define in detail how far the measure of home rule\r\nshould go; but it may be said in general that the functions delegated or\r\npreserved should so far as possible be completely delegated or\r\npreserved. This rule cannot be rigidly applied to such essential\r\nfunctions of the state governments as the preservation of order and the\r\nsystem of education. The delegation of certain police powers and a\r\ncertain control over local schools is considered at present both\r\nconvenient and necessary, although in the course of time such may no\r\nlonger be the case; but if these essential functions are delegated, the\r\nstate should retain a certain supervision over the manner of their\r\nexercise. On the other hand, the municipality as an economic and\r\nbusiness organism should be left pretty much to its own devices; and it\r\nis not too much to say that the state should not interfere in these\r\nmatters at all, except under the rarest and most exceptional conditions.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for municipal home rule in all economic and business\r\nquestions are sufficiently obvious. A state is a political and legal\r\nbody; and as a political and legal body it cannot escape its appropriate\r\npolitical and social responsibilities. But a state has in the great\r\nmajority of cases no meaning at all as a center of economic organization\r\nand direction. The business carried on within state limits is either\r\nessentially related by competition to the national economic system,--or\r\nelse it is essentially municipal in its scope and meaning. Of course,\r\nsuch a statement is not strictly true. The states have certain essential\r\neconomic duties in respect to the conservation and development of\r\nagricultural resources and methods and to the construction and\r\nmaintenance of a comprehensive system of highways. But these legitimate\r\neconomic responsibilities are not very numerous or very onerous compared\r\nto those which should be left to the central government on the one hand\r\nor to the municipal governments on the other. A municipality is a living\r\ncenter of economic activity--a genuine case of essentially local\r\neconomic interests. To be sure, the greater part of the manufacturing or\r\ncommercial business transacted in a city belongs undubitably to the\r\nnational economic system; but there is a minor part which is exclusively\r\nlocal. Public service corporations which control franchises in cities do\r\nnot enter into inter-state commerce at all--except in those unusual\r\ncases (as in New York) where certain parts of the economic municipal\r\nbody are situated in another state. They should be subject,\r\nconsequently, to municipal jurisdiction and only that. The city alone\r\nhas anything really important to gain or to lose from their proper or\r\nimproper treatment; and its legal responsibility should be as complete\r\nas its economic localization is real.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of discussing in any detail the way in which a\r\nmunicipal government which does enjoy the advantage of home rule and an\r\nefficient organization can contribute to the work of national economic\r\nand social reconstruction. Public opinion is tending to accept much more\r\nadvanced ideas in this field of municipal reform than it is in any other\r\npart of the political battle-field. Experiments are already being tried,\r\nlooking in the direction of an increasingly responsible municipal\r\norganization, and an increasing assumption by the city of economic and\r\nsocial functions. Numerous books are being written on various aspects of\r\nthe movement, which is showing the utmost vitality and is constantly\r\nmaking progress in the right direction. In all probability, the American\r\ncity will become in the near future the most fruitful field for\r\neconomically and socially constructive experimentation; and the effect\r\nof the example set therein will have a beneficially reactive effect upon\r\nboth state and Federal politics. The benefits which the city governments\r\ncan slowly accomplish within their own jurisdiction are considerable.\r\nThey do not, indeed, constitute the exclusive \"Hope of Democracy,\"\r\nbecause the ultimate democratic hope depends on the fulfillment of\r\nnational responsibilities; and they cannot deal effectively with certain\r\nof the fundamental social questions. But by taking advantage of its\r\neconomic opportunities, the American city can gradually diminish the\r\neconomic stress within its own jurisdiction. It has unique chance of\r\nappropriating for the local community those sources of economic value\r\nwhich are created by the community, and it has an equally unique\r\nopportunity of spending the money so obtained for the amelioration of\r\nthe sanitary, if not of the fundamental economic and social, condition\r\nof the poorer people.\r\n\r\nThere is, finally, one fundamental national problem with which the state\r\ngovernments, no matter to what extent they may be liberated and\r\ninvigorated, are wholly incompetent to deal. The regulation of commerce,\r\nthe control of corporations, and the still more radical questions\r\nconnected with the distribution of wealth and the prevention of\r\npoverty--questions of this kind should be left exclusively to the\r\ncentral government; or in case they are to any extent allowed to remain\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the states, they should exercise such\r\njurisdiction as the agents of the central government. The state\r\ngovernments lack and must always lack the power and the independence\r\nnecessary to deal with this whole group of problems; and as long as they\r\nremain preoccupied therewith, their effective energy and good intentions\r\nwill be diverted from the consideration of those aspects of political\r\nand social reform with which they are peculiarly competent to deal. The\r\nwhole future prosperity and persistence of the American Federal system\r\nis bound up in the progressive solution of this group of problems; and\r\nif it is left to the conflicting jurisdictions of the central and local\r\ngovernments, the American democracy will have to abandon in this respect\r\nthe idea of seeking the realization of a really national policy.\r\nJustification for these statements will be offered in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS OF RECONSTRUCTION--(_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nAny proposal to alter the responsibilities and powers now enjoyed by the\r\ncentral and the state governments in respect to the control of\r\ncorporations and the distribution of wealth involves, of course, the\r\nFederal rather than the state constitutions; and the amendment of the\r\nformer is both a more difficult and a more dangerous task than is the\r\namendment of the latter. A nation cannot afford to experiment with its\r\nfundamental law as it may and must experiment with its local\r\ninstitutions. As a matter of fact the Federal Constitution is very much\r\nless in need of amendment than are those of the several states. It is on\r\nthe whole an admirable system of law and an efficient organ of\r\ngovernment; and in most respects it should be left to the ordinary\r\nprocess of gradual amendment by legal construction until the American\r\npeople have advanced much farther towards the realization of a national\r\ndemocratic policy. Eventually certain radical amendments will be\r\nindispensable to the fulfillment of the American national purpose; but\r\nexcept in one respect nothing of any essential importance is to be\r\ngained at present by a modification of the Federal Constitution. This\r\nexception is, however, of the utmost importance. For another generation\r\nor two any solution of the problem of corporation control, and of all\r\nthe other critical problems connected therewith, will be complicated,\r\nconfused, and delayed by the inter-state commerce clause, and by the\r\nimpossibility, under that clause, of the exercise of any really\r\neffective responsibility and power by the central government. The\r\ndistinction between domestic and inter-state commerce which is implied\r\nby the Constitutional distribution of powers is a distinction of\r\ninsignificant economic or industrial importance; and its necessary legal\r\nenforcement makes the carrying out of an efficient national industrial\r\npolicy almost impossible.\r\n\r\nUnder the inter-state commerce clause, a corporation conducting, as all\r\nlarge companies do, both a state and an inter-state business, is\r\nsubject to several supplementary jurisdictions. It is subject, of\r\ncourse, primarily to the laws of the state under which it is organized,\r\nand to the laws of the same state regulating its own particular form of\r\nindustrial operation. It is subject, also, to any conditions which the\r\nlegislatures of other states may wish to impose upon its business,--in\r\nso far as that business is transacted within their jurisdictions.\r\nFinally, it is subject to any regulation which the central government\r\nmay impose upon its inter-state transactions. From the standpoint of\r\nlegal supervision, consequently, the affairs of such a corporation are\r\ndivided into a series of compartments, each compartment being determined\r\nby certain arbitrary geographical lines--lines which do not, like the\r\nboundaries of a municipality, correspond to any significant economic\r\ndivision. As long as such a method of supervision endures, no effective\r\nregulation of commerce or industry is possible. A corporation is not a\r\ncommercial Pooh-Bah, divided into unrelated sections. It is an\r\nindustrial and commercial individual. The business which it transacts in\r\none state is vitally related to the business which it transacts in other\r\nstates; and even in those rare cases of the restriction of a business to\r\nthe limits of a single state, the purchasing and selling made in its\r\ninterest necessarily compete with inter-state transactions in the same\r\nproducts. Thus the Constitutional distinction between state and\r\ninter-state commerce is irrelevant to the real facts of American\r\nindustry and trade.\r\n\r\nIn the past the large corporations have, on the whole, rather preferred\r\nstate to centralized regulation, because of the necessary inefficiency\r\nof the former. Inter-state railroad companies usually exercised a\r\ndominant influence in those states under the laws of which they had\r\nincorporated; and this influence was so beneficial to them that they\r\nwere quite willing for the sake of preserving it to subsidize the\r\npolitical machine and pay a certain amount of blackmail. In this way the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company exercised a dominant influence in the\r\npolitics of Pennsylvania and New Jersey; the New York Central was not\r\nafraid of anything that could happen at Albany; the Boston and Maine\r\npretty well controlled the legislation of the state of New Hampshire;\r\nand the Southern Pacific had its own will in California. Probably in\r\nthese and other instances the railroads acquired their political\r\ninfluence primarily for purposes of protection. It was the cheapest form\r\nof blackmail they could pay to the professional politicians; and in this\r\nrespect they differed from the public service corporations, which have\r\nfrequently been active agents of corruption in order to obtain public\r\nfranchises for less than their value. But once the railroads had\r\nacquired their political influence, they naturally used it for their own\r\npurposes. They arranged that the state railroad commissioners should be\r\ntheir clerks, and that taxation should not press too heavily upon them.\r\nThey were big enough to control the public officials whose duty it was\r\nto supervise them; and they were content with a situation which left\r\nthem free from embarrassing interference without being over-expensive.\r\n\r\nThe situation thereby created, however, was not only extremely\r\nundesirable in the public interest, but it was at bottom extremely\r\ndangerous to the railroads. These companies were constantly extending\r\ntheir mileage, increasing their equipment, improving their terminals,\r\nand enlarging their capital stock. Their operations covered many\r\ndifferent states, and their total investments ran far into the hundreds\r\nof millions of dollars. In the meantime they remained subject to one or\r\nseveral different political authorities whose jurisdiction extended over\r\nonly a portion of their line and a fraction of their business, but who\r\ncould none the less by unwise interference throw the whole system out of\r\ngear, and compromise the earning power of many millions of dollars\r\ninvested in other states. Moreover, they could, if they chose, make all\r\nthis trouble with a comparative lack of responsibility, because only a\r\nfraction of the ill effects of this foolish regulation would be felt\r\nwithin the guilty state. As a matter of fact many railroads had\r\nexperiences of this kind with the Western states, and were obliged to\r\ndefend themselves against legislative and administrative dictation,\r\nwhich if it did not amount to confiscation, always applied narrow and\r\nrigid restrictive methods to a delicate and complicated economic\r\nsituation. Most of the large Eastern and some of the large Western\r\ncompanies purchased immunity from such \"supervision,\" and were well\r\ncontent; but it was mere blindness on their part not to understand that\r\nsuch a condition, with the ugly corruption it involved, could not\r\ncontinue. The time was bound to come when an aroused public opinion\r\nwould undermine their \"influence,\" and would retaliate by imposing upon\r\nthem restrictions of a most embarrassing and expensive character. In so\r\ndoing the leaders of a reformed and aroused public opinion might be\r\nhonestly seeking only legitimate regulation; but the more the state\r\nauthorities sought conscientiously to regulate the railroads the worse\r\nthe confusion they would create. The railroad could not escape some\r\nrestrictive supervision; neither were they obliged wholly to submit to\r\nit on the part of any one state. The situation of a railroad running\r\nthrough half a dozen states, and subject to the contradictory and\r\nirresponsible orders of half a dozen legislatures or commissions might\r\nwell become intolerable.\r\n\r\nJust this sort of thing has been recently happening. The state\r\nauthorities began to realize that their lax methods of railway\r\nsupervision were being used as an argument for increased Federal\r\ninterference. So the state governments arose in their might and began\r\nfuriously to \"regulate\" the railroads. Commissions were constituted or\r\nre-constituted, and extremely drastic powers were granted to these\r\nofficials in respect to the operation of the railroads, the rates and\r\nthe fares charged, and their financial policies. Bills were passed\r\nseverely restricting the rights which companies had enjoyed of owning\r\nthe stock of connecting railroads. Many of the states sought to forbid\r\nthe companies from charging more than two cents a mile for passenger\r\nfares. The issuing of passes except under severe restrictions was made\r\nillegal. The railroad companies were suddenly confronted by a mass of\r\nhostile and conflicting legislation which represented for the most part\r\nan honest attempt to fulfill a neglected responsibility, but whose\r\neffort on the whole merely embarrassed the operations of the roads, and\r\nwhich in many instances failed to protect the real public interests\r\ninvolved. Even when this legislation was not ignorantly and unwisely\r\nconceived, and even when it was prepared by well-informed and\r\nwell-intentioned men, it was informed by contradictory ideas and a false\r\nconception of the genuine abuses and their necessary remedies.\r\nConsequently, a certain fraction of intelligent and disinterested public\r\nopinion began soon to realize that the results of a vigorous attempt on\r\nthe part of the state governments to use their powers and to fulfill\r\ntheir responsibilities in respect to the railroads were actually worse\r\nand more dangerous to the public interest than was the previous neglect.\r\nThe neglect of the responsibility implied corruption, because it\r\nprovoked blackmail. The vigorous fulfillment of the responsibility\r\nimplied confusion, cross-purposes, and excessive severity, because the\r\npowers of a single state were too great within its specific jurisdiction\r\nand absolutely negligible beyond.\r\n\r\nThe railroad companies suffer more from this piecemeal and conflicting\r\nregulation than do corporations engaged in manufacturing operations, not\r\nonly because they discharge a peculiarly public function, but because\r\ntheir business, particularly in its rate-making aspect, suffers severely\r\nfrom any division by arbitrary geographical lines. But all large\r\ninter-state corporations are more or less in the same situation.\r\nCorporations such as the Standard Oil Company and some of the large New\r\nYork life insurance companies are confronted by the alternative either\r\nof going out of business in certain states, or of submitting to\r\nrestrictions which would compromise the efficiency of their whole\r\nbusiness policy. Doubtless they have not exhausted the evasive and\r\ndilatory methods which have served them so well in the past; but little\r\nby little the managers of these corporations are coming to realize that\r\nthey are losing more than they gain from subjection to so many\r\nconflicting and supplementary jurisdictions. Little by little they are\r\ncoming to realize that the only way in which their businesses can obtain\r\na firm legal standing is by means of Federal recognition and exclusive\r\nFederal regulation. They would like doubtless to continue to escape any\r\neffective regulation at all; but without it they cannot obtain effective\r\nrecognition, and in the existing ferment of public opinion recognition\r\nhas become more important to them than regulation is dangerous.\r\n\r\nMany important financiers and corporation lawyers are still bitterly\r\nopposed to any effective centralized regulation, even if accompanied by\r\nrecognition; but such opposition is not merely inaccessible to the\r\nlessons of experience, but is blinded by theoretical prejudice.\r\nDoubtless the position of being, on the one hand, inefficiently\r\nregulated by the state governments, and, on the other hand, of being\r\nefficiently protected in all their essential rights by the Federal\r\ncourts--doubtless such a situation seems very attractive to men who\r\nneed a very free hand for the accomplishment of their business purposes;\r\nbut they should be able to understand that it would necessarily produce\r\nendless friction. The states may well submit to the constant extension\r\nof a protecting arm to corporations by the Federal courts, provided the\r\ncentral government is accomplishing more efficiently than can any\r\ncombination of state governments the amount of supervision demanded by\r\nthe public interest. But if the Federal courts are to be constantly\r\ninvoked, in order to thwart the will of state legislatures and\r\ncommissions, and if at the same time the authority which protects either\r\nneglects or is unable effectively to supervise, there is bound to be a\r\nrevival of anti-Federal feeling in its most dangerous form. Whatever the\r\ncorporations may suffer from the efficient exercise of Federal\r\nregulative powers, they have far more to fear from the action of the\r\nstate governments--provided such action proceeds from an irresponsible\r\nlocal radicalism embittered by being thwarted. The public opinion on\r\nwhich the corporations must depend for fair treatment is national rather\r\nthan local; and just in as far as they can be made subject to exclusive\r\ncentralized jurisdiction, just to that extent is there a good chance of\r\ntheir gradual incorporation into a nationalized economic and legal\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe control of the central government over commerce and the corporations\r\nshould consequently be substituted for the control of the states rather\r\nthan added thereto; and this action should be taken not in order to\r\nenfeeble American local governments, but to invigorate them. The\r\nenjoyment by any public authority of a function which it cannot\r\nefficiently perform is always a source of weakness rather than of\r\nstrength; and in this particular case it is a necessary source, not\r\nmerely of weakness, but of corruption. The less the state governments\r\nhave to do with private corporations whose income is greater than their\r\nown, the better it will be for their morals, and the more effectively\r\nare they likely to perform their own proper and legitimate functions.\r\nSeveral generations may well elapse before the American public opinion\r\nwill learn this lesson; and even after it is well learned there will be\r\nenormous and peculiar obstacles to be removed before they can turn their\r\ninstruction to good account. But in the end the American Federal\r\nConstitution, like all the Federal Constitutions framed during the past\r\ncentury, will have to dispense with the distinction between state and\r\ninter-state commerce; and the national authority will prevail, not\r\nbecause there is any peculiar virtue in the action of the central\r\ngovernment, but because there is a peculiar vice in asking the state\r\ngovernments to regulate matters beyond their effective jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE RECOGNITION OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe central government in its policy toward the large corporations must\r\nadopt one of two courses. Either it must discriminate in their favor or\r\nit must discriminate against them. The third alternative--that of being\r\nwhat is called \"impartial\"--has no real existence; and it is essential\r\nthat the illusory nature of a policy of impartiality should in the\r\nbeginning be clearly understood.\r\n\r\nA policy of impartiality is supposed to consist in recognizing the\r\nexistence of the huge industrial and railroad organizations, while at\r\nthe same time forbidding them the enjoyment of any of those little\r\ndevices whereby they have obtained an unfair advantage over competitors.\r\nIt would consist, that is, of a policy of recognition tempered by\r\nregulation; and a policy of this kind is the one favored by the majority\r\nof conservative and fair-minded reformers. Such a policy has\r\nunquestionably a great deal to recommend it as a transitional means of\r\ndealing with the problem of corporate aggrandizement, but let there be\r\nno mistake: it is not really a policy of strict neutrality between the\r\nsmall and the large industrial agent. Any recognition of the large\r\ncorporations, any successful attempt to give them a legal standing as\r\nauthentic as their economic efficiency, amounts substantially to a\r\ndiscrimination in their favor.\r\n\r\nThe whole official programme of regulation does not in any effective way\r\nprotect their competitors. Unquestionably these large corporations have\r\nin the past thrived partly on illegal favors, such as rebates, which\r\nwould be prevented by the official programme of regulation; but at the\r\npresent time the advantage which they enjoy over their competitors is\r\nindependent of such practices. It depends upon their capture and\r\noccupation of certain essential strategic positions in the economic\r\nbattle-field. It depends upon abundant capital, which enables it to take\r\nadvantage of every opportunity, and to buy and sell to the best\r\nadvantage. It depends upon the permanent appropriation of essential\r\nsupplies of raw materials, such as iron ore and coal, or of terminals in\r\nlarge cities, which cannot now be duplicated. It depends upon\r\npossibilities of economic industrial management and of the systematic\r\ndevelopment of individual industrial ability and experience which exist\r\nto a peculiar degree in large industrial enterprises. None of these\r\nsources of economic efficiency will be in any way diminished by the\r\nofficial programme of regulation. The corporations will still possess\r\nsubstantially all of their existing advantages over their competitors,\r\nwhile to these will be added the additional one of an unimpeachable\r\nlegal standing. Like the life insurance companies after the process of\r\npurgation, they will be able largely to reduce expenses by abolishing\r\ntheir departments of doubtful law.\r\n\r\nThus the recognition of the large corporation is equivalent to the\r\nperpetuation of its existing advantages. It is not an explicit\r\ndiscrimination against their smaller competitors, but it amounts to such\r\ndiscrimination. If the small competitor is to be allowed a chance of\r\nregaining his former economic importance, he must receive the active\r\nassistance of the government. Its policy must become, not one of\r\nrecognition, but one of recognition under conditions which would impair\r\nthe efficiency of the large industrial organizations. Mr. William J.\r\nBryan's policy of a Federal license granted only under certain rigid\r\nconditions as to size, is aimed precisely at the impairment of the\r\nefficiency of the \"trusts,\" and the consequent active discrimination in\r\nfavor of the small competitor; but the Roosevelt-Taft programme allows\r\nthe small competitor only such advantages as he is capable of earning\r\nfor himself; and it must be admitted that these advantages are,\r\nparticularly in certain dominant industries, not of a very encouraging\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at the last general election the American people cast a\r\ndecisively preponderant vote in favor of the Roosevelt-Taft programme;\r\nand in so doing they showed their customary common sense. The huge\r\ncorporations have contributed to American economic efficiency. They\r\nconstitute an important step in the direction of the better\r\norganization of industry and commerce. They have not, except in certain\r\nexceptional cases, suppressed competition; but they have regulated it;\r\nand it should be the effort of all civilized societies to substitute\r\ncoöperative for competitive methods, wherever coöperation can prove its\r\nefficiency. Deliberately to undo this work of industrial and commercial\r\norganization would constitute a logical application of the principle of\r\nequal rights, but it would also constitute a step backward in the\r\nprocess of economic and social advance. The process of industrial\r\norganization should be allowed to work itself out. Whenever the smaller\r\ncompetitor of the large corporation is unable to keep his head above\r\nwater with his own exertions, he should be allowed to drown. That the\r\nsmaller business man will entirely be displaced by the large corporation\r\nis wholly improbable. There are certain industries and lines of trade in\r\nwhich he will be able to hold his own; but where he is not able to hold\r\nhis own, there is no public interest promoted by any expensive attempt\r\nto save his life.\r\n\r\nThe Sherman Anti-Trust Law constitutes precisely such an attempt to save\r\nthe life of the small competitor; and in case the Roosevelt-Taft policy\r\nof recognition tempered by regulation is to prevail, the first step to\r\nbe taken is the repeal or the revision of that law. As long as it\r\nremains on the statute books in its existing form, it constitutes an\r\nannouncement that the national interest of the American people demands\r\nactive discrimination in favor of the small industrial and commercial\r\nagent. It denies the desirability of recognizing what has already been\r\naccomplished in the way of industrial and commercial organization; and\r\naccording to prevalent interpretations, it makes the legal standing of\r\nall large industrial combinations insecure--no matter how conducive to\r\neconomic efficiency their business policy may be.\r\n\r\nAssuming, however, that the Sherman Anti-Trust Law can be repealed, and\r\nthat the Roosevelt-Taft policy of recognition tempered by regulation be\r\nadopted, the question remains as to the manner in which such a policy\r\ncan best be carried out. Certain essential aspects of this question will\r\nnot be discussed in the present connection. The thorough carrying out of\r\na policy of recognition would demand a Federal incorporation act, under\r\nwhich all corporations engaged in anything but an exclusively local\r\nbusiness would be obliged to organize; but, as we have already seen,\r\nsuch an act would be unconstitutional as applied to many technically\r\ndomestic corporations, and it would probably be altogether\r\nunconstitutional, except, perhaps, under limitations which would make it\r\nvalueless. It may be that some means will be found to evade these\r\nConstitutional difficulties, or it may not be. These are matters on\r\nwhich none but the best of Constitutional lawyers have any right to an\r\nopinion. But in any event, I shall assume that the Federal government\r\ncan eventually find the legal means to make its policy of recognition\r\neffective and to give the \"trust\" a definite legal standing. What sort\r\nof regulation should supplement such emphatic recognition?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of such supervision is, of course, to prevent those abuses\r\nwhich have in the past given the larger corporation an illegal or an\r\n\"unfair\" advantage over its competitors; and the engine which American\r\nlegislatures, both Federal and state, are using for the purpose is the\r\ncommission. The attempt to define in a comprehensive statute just what\r\ncorporations may do, or must in the public interest be forbidden from\r\ndoing, is not being tried, because of the apparent impossibility of\r\nproviding in advance against every possible perversion of the public\r\ninterest in the interest of the private corporation. The responsibility\r\nof the legislature for the protection of the public interest is\r\nconsequently delegated to a commission whose duties are partly\r\nadministrative and partly either legislative or judicial. The most\r\ncomplete existing type of such a delegated power is not the Federal\r\nInter-state Commerce Commission, but the Public Service Commissions of\r\nNew York State; and in considering the meaning and probable effects of\r\nthis kind of supervision I shall consider only the completed type. A\r\nFederal Inter-state Commerce Commission which was fully competent to\r\nsupervise all inter-state commerce and all commerce competing therewith\r\nwould necessarily possess powers analogous to those bestowed upon the\r\nNew York Public Service Commissions.\r\n\r\nThe powers bestowed upon those commissions are based upon the assumption\r\nthat the corporations under their jurisdiction cannot be trusted to take\r\nany important decision in respect to their business without official\r\napproval. All such acts must be known to the commission, and be either\r\nexpressly or tacitly approved, and the official body has the power of\r\nordering their wards to make any changes in their service or rates which\r\nin the opinion of the commission are desirable in the public interest.\r\nThus the commission is required not only to approve all agreements among\r\ncorporations, all mergers, all issues of securities, but they are in\r\ngeneral responsible for the manner in which the corporations are\r\noperated. The grant of such huge powers can be explained only on the\r\nground that the private interest of these corporations is radically\r\nopposed to the interest of their patrons. Public opinion must have\r\ndecided that if left to themselves, the corporations will behave, on the\r\nwhole, in a manner inimical to the public welfare; and their business\r\nmust consequently be actually or tacitly \"regulated\" in every important\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nOne may well hesitate wholly to condemn this government by commission,\r\nbecause it is the first emphatic recognition in American political and\r\neconomic organization of a manifest public responsibility. In the past\r\nthe public interests involved in the growth of an extensive and highly\r\norganized industrial system have been neither recognized nor promoted.\r\nThey have not been promoted by the states, partly because the states\r\nneither wanted to do so, nor when they had the will, did they have the\r\npower. They have not been promoted by the central government because\r\nirresponsibility in relation to national economic interest was, the\r\ntariff apart, supposed to be an attribute of the central authority. Any\r\nlegislation which seeks to promote this neglected public interest is\r\nconsequently to be welcomed; but the welcome accorded to these\r\ncommissions should not be very enthusiastic. It should not be any more\r\nenthusiastic than the welcome accorded by the citizens of a kingdom to\r\nthe birth of a first child to the reigning monarchs,--a child who turns\r\nout to be a girl, incapable under the law of inheriting the crown. A\r\nfemale heir is under such circumstances merely the promise of better\r\nthings; and so these commissions are merely an evidence of good will and\r\nthe promise of something better. As initial experiments in the attempt\r\nto redeem a neglected responsibility, they may be tolerated; but if they\r\nare tolerated for too long, they may well work more harm than good.\r\n\r\nThe constructive idea behind a policy of the recognition of\r\nsemi-monopolistic corporations, is, of course, the idea that they can be\r\nconverted into economic agents which will make unequivocally for the\r\nnational economic interest; and it is natural that in the beginning\r\nlegislators should propose to accomplish this result by rigid and\r\ncomprehensive official supervision. But such supervision, while it would\r\neradicate many actual and possible abuses, would be just as likely to\r\ndamage the efficiency which has been no less characteristic of these\r\ncorporate operations. The only reason for recognizing the large\r\ncorporations as desirable economic institutions is just their supposed\r\neconomic efficiency; and if the means taken to regulate them impair that\r\nefficiency, the government is merely adopting in a roundabout way a\r\npolicy of destruction. Now, hitherto, their efficiency has been partly\r\nthe product of the unusual freedom they have enjoyed. Unquestionably\r\nthey cannot continue to enjoy any similar freedom hereafter; but in\r\nrestricting it care should be taken not to destroy with the freedom the\r\nessential condition of the efficiency. The essential condition of\r\nefficiency is always concentration of responsibility; and the decisive\r\nobjection to government by commission as any sufficient solution of the\r\ncorporation problem is the implied substitution of a system of divided\r\nfor a system of concentrated responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis objection will seem fanciful and far-fetched to the enthusiastic\r\nadvocates of reform by commission. They like to believe that under a\r\nsystem of administrative regulation abuses can be extirpated without any\r\ndiminution of the advantages hitherto enjoyed under private management;\r\nbut if such proves to be the case, American regulative commissions will\r\nestablish a wholly new record of official good management. Such\r\ncommissions, responsible as they are to an insistent and uninformed\r\npublic opinion, and possessed as they inevitably become of the peculiar\r\nofficial point of view, inevitably drift or are driven to incessant,\r\nvexatious, and finally harmful interference. The efficient conduct of\r\nany complicated business, be it manufacturing, transportation, or\r\npolitical, always involves the constant sacrifice of an occasional or a\r\nlocal interest for the benefit of the economic operation of the whole\r\norganization. But it is just such sacrifices of local and occasional to\r\na comprehensive interest which official commissions are not allowed by\r\npublic opinion to approve. Under their control rates will be made\r\nchiefly for the benefit of clamorous local interests; and little by\r\nlittle the economic organization of the country, so far as affected by\r\nthe action of commission government, would become the increasing rigid\r\nvictim of routine management. The flexibility and enterprise,\r\ncharacteristic of our existing national economic organization, would\r\nslowly disappear; and American industrial leaders would lose the\r\ninitiative and energy which has contributed so much to the efficiency of\r\nthe national economic system. Such a result would, of course, only take\r\nplace gradually; but it would none the less be the eventual result of\r\nany complete adoption of such a method of supervision. The friends of\r\ncommission government who expect to discipline the big corporations\r\nseverely without injuring their efficiency are merely the victims of an\r\nerror as old as the human will. They \"want it both ways.\" They want to\r\neat their cake and to have it. They want to obtain from a system of\r\nminute official regulation and divided responsibility the same economic\r\nresults as have been obtained from a system of almost complete freedom\r\nand absolutely concentrated responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not, however, misinterpret the real meaning of the\r\nobjection just made to corporation reform by means of commissions. I can\r\nsee no ground for necessarily opposing the granting of increased power\r\nand responsibility to an official or a commission of officials, merely\r\nbecause such officials are paid by the government rather than by a\r\nprivate employer. But when such a grant is considered necessary, the\r\nattempt should be to make the opportunity for good work comprehensive\r\nand commensurate with the responsibility. The sort of officialism of\r\nwhich the excavations at Panama or the reclamation service is a sample\r\nhas as much chance of being efficient under suitable conditions as has\r\nthe work of a private corporation. The government assumes complete\r\ncharge of a job, and pushes it to a successful or unsuccessful\r\nconclusion, according to the extent with which its tradition or\r\norganization enables it to perform efficient work. Moreover, there is a\r\ncertain kind of official supervision of a private business which does\r\nnot bring with it any divided responsibility. Perhaps the best\r\nillustration thereof is the regulation to which the national banks are\r\nobliged to submit. In this case the bank examiners and the Controller do\r\nnot interfere in the management of the bank, except when the management\r\nis violating certain conditions of safe banking--which have been\r\ncarefully defined in the statute. So long as the banks obey the law,\r\nthey need have no fear of the Treasury Department. But in commission\r\ngovernment the official authority, in a sense, both makes and\r\nadministers the law. The commission is empowered to use its own\r\ndiscretion about many matters, such as rates, service, equipment, and\r\nthe like, in relation to which the law places the corporation absolutely\r\nin its hands. Such official interference is of a kind which can hardly\r\nfail in the long run to go wrong. It is based on a false principle, and\r\ninterferes with individual liberty, not necessarily in an unjustifiable\r\nway, but in a way that can hardly be liberating in spirit or\r\nconstructive in result.\r\n\r\nThe need for regulation should not be made the excuse for bestowing upon\r\nofficials a responsibility which they cannot in the long run properly\r\nredeem. In so far as the functions of such commissions are really\r\nregulative, like the functions of the bank examiners, they may for the\r\npresent perform a useful public service. These commissions should be\r\nconstituted partly as bureaus of information and publicity, and partly\r\nas an administrative agency to secure the effective enforcement of the\r\nlaw. In case the Sherman Anti-Trust Law were repealed, the law\r\nsubstituted therefor should define the kind of combination among\r\ncorporations and the kind of agreements among railroads which were\r\npermissible, and the commission should be empowered to apply the law to\r\nany particular consolidation or contract. Similar provision should be\r\nmade in respect to railroad mergers, and the purchases by one railroad\r\nof the stock of another. The purposes for which new securities might be\r\nlegitimately issued should also be defined in the statute, and the\r\ncommission allowed merely to enforce the definitions. Common carriers\r\nshould be obliged, as at present, to place on record their schedules of\r\nrates, and when a special or a new rate was made, notification should be\r\nrequired to the commission, together with a statement of reasons.\r\nFinally the commission should have the completest possible power of\r\ninvestigating any aspect of railway and corporation management or\r\nfinance the knowledge of which might be useful to Congress. The\r\nunflinching use of powers, vaguely sketched above, would be sufficient\r\nto prevent mere abuses, and they could be granted without making any\r\nbody of officials personally responsible for any of the essential\r\ndetails of corporation management.\r\n\r\nIf the commission is granted the power to promulgate rates, to control\r\nthe service granted to the public, or to order the purchase of new\r\nequipment, it has become more than a regulative official body. It has\r\nbecome responsible for the business management of the corporation\r\ncommitted to its charge; and again it must be asserted that mixed\r\ncontrol of this kind is bound to take the energy and initiative out of\r\nsuch business organizations. Neither has any necessity for reducing\r\npublic service corporations to the level of industrial minors been\r\nsufficiently demonstrated. In the matter of service and rates the\r\ninterest of a common carrier is not at bottom and in the long run\r\nantagonistic to the interest of its patrons. The fundamental interest of\r\na common carrier is to develop traffic, and this interest coincides with\r\nthe interest in general of the communities it serves. This interest can\r\nbest be satisfied by allowing the carrier freedom in the making of its\r\nschedules--subject only to review in particular cases. Special instances\r\nmay always exist of unnecessarily high or excessively discriminatory\r\nrates; and provisions should be made for the consideration of such\r\ncases, perhaps, by some court specially organized for the purpose; but\r\nthe assumption should be, on the whole, that the matter of rates and\r\nservice can be left to the interest of the corporation itself. In no\r\nother way can the American economic system retain that flexibility with\r\nwhich its past efficiency has been associated. In no other way can the\r\npolicy of these corporations continue to be, as it has so often been in\r\nthe past, in an economic sense genuinely constructive. This flexibility\r\nfrequently requires readjustments in the conditions of local industry\r\nwhich cause grave losses to individuals or even communities; but it is\r\njust such readjustments which are necessary to continued economic\r\nefficiency; and it is just such readjustments which would tend to be\r\nprevented by an official rate-making authority. An official rate-making\r\npower would necessarily prefer certain rigid rules, favorable to the\r\nexisting distribution of population and business. Every tendency to a\r\nnew and more efficient distribution of trade would be checked, because\r\nof its unfairness to those who suffer from it. Thus the American\r\nindustrial system would gradually become petrified, and the national\r\norganization of American industry would be sacrificed for the benefit of\r\nan indiscriminate collection of local interests.\r\n\r\nIf the interest of a corporation is so essentially hostile to the public\r\ninterest as to require the sort of official supervision provided by the\r\nNew York Public Service Commission Law, the logical inference therefrom\r\nis not a system of semi-official and semi-private management, but a\r\nsystem of exclusively public management. The logical inference therefrom\r\nis public ownership, if not actual public operation. Public ownership is\r\nnot open to the same theoretical objections as is government by\r\ncommission. It is not a system of divided responsibility. Political\r\nconditions and the organization of the American civil service being what\r\nthey are, the attempt of the authorities to assume such a responsibility\r\nmight not be very successful; but the fault would in that case reside in\r\nthe general political and administrative organization. The community\r\ncould not redeem the particular responsibility of owning and operating a\r\nrailroad, because it was not organized for the really efficient conduct\r\nof any practical business. The rejection of a system of divided personal\r\nresponsibility between public and private officials does not\r\nconsequently bring with it necessarily the rejection of a system of\r\npublic ownership, if not public operation; and if it can be demonstrated\r\nin the case of any particular class of corporations that its interest\r\nhas become in any essential respect hostile to the public interest, a\r\nconstructive industrial policy demands, not a partial, but a much more\r\ncomplete, shifting of the responsibility.\r\n\r\nThat cases exist in which public ownership can be justified on the\r\nforegoing grounds, I do not doubt; but before coming to the\r\nconsideration of such cases it must be remarked that this new phase of\r\nthe discussion postulates the existence of hitherto neglected conditions\r\nand objects of a constructive industrial policy. Such a policy started\r\nwith the decision, which may be called the official decision, of the\r\nAmerican electorate, to recognize the existing corporate economic\r\norganization; and we have been inquiring into the implications of this\r\ndecision. Those implications include, according to the results of the\r\nforegoing discussion, not only a repeal of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law,\r\nbut the tempering of the recognition with certain statutory regulations.\r\nIt by no means follows that such regulation satisfies all the objects of\r\na constructive national economic policy. In fact it does not satisfy the\r\nneeds of a national economic policy at all, just in so far as such a\r\npolicy is concerned not merely with the organization of industry, but\r\nwith the distribution of wealth. But inasmuch as the decision has\r\nalready been reached in preceding chapters that the national interest of\r\na democratic state is essentially concerned with the distribution of\r\nwealth, the corporation problem must be considered quite as much in its\r\nrelation to the social problem as to the problem of economic efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe American corporation problem will never be understood in its proper\r\nrelations and full consequences until it is conceived as a sort of an\r\nadvanced attack on the breastworks of our national economic system by\r\nthis essential problem of the distribution of wealth. The current\r\nexperiments in the direction of corporate \"regulation\" are prompted by a\r\ncurious mixture of divergent motives. They endeavor to evade a\r\nfundamental responsibility by meeting a superficial one. They endeavor\r\nto solve the corporation problem merely by eradicating abuses, the\r\nimplication being that as soon as the abuses are supervised out of\r\nexistence, the old harmony between public and private interest in the\r\nAmerican economic system will be restored, and no more \"socialistic\"\r\nlegislation will be required. But the extent to which this very\r\nregulation is being carried betrays the futility of the expectation. And\r\nas we have seen, the intention of the industrial reformers is to\r\nintroduce public management into the heart of the American industrial\r\nsystem; that is, into the operation of railroads and public service\r\ncorporations, and in this way to bring about by incessant official\r\ninterference that harmony between public and private interest which must\r\nbe the object of a national economic system. But this proposed remedy is\r\nsimply one more way of shirking the ultimate problem; and it is the\r\nlogical consequence of the persistent misinterpretation of our\r\nunwholesome economic inequalities as the result merely of the abuse,\r\ninstead of the legal use, of the opportunities provided by the existing\r\neconomic system.\r\n\r\nAn economic organization framed in the national interest would conform\r\nto the same principles as a political organization framed in the\r\nnational interest. It would stimulate the peculiarly efficient\r\nindividual by offering him opportunities for work commensurate with his\r\nabilities and training. It would grant him these opportunities under\r\nconditions which would tend to bring about their responsible use. And it\r\nwould seek to make the results promote the general economic welfare. The\r\npeculiar advantage of the organization of American industry which has\r\ngradually been wrought during the past fifty years is precisely the\r\nopportunity which it has offered to men of exceptional ability to\r\nperform really constructive economic work. The public interest has\r\nnothing to gain from the mutilation or the destruction of these\r\nnationalized economic institutions. It should seek, on the contrary, to\r\npreserve them, just in so far as they continue to remain efficient; but\r\nit should at the same time seek the better distribution of the fruits of\r\nthis efficiency. The great objection to the type of regulation\r\nconstituted by the New York Public Service Commission Law is that it\r\ntends to deprive the peculiarly capable industrial manager of any\r\nsufficient opportunity to turn his abilities and experience to good\r\naccount. It places him under the tutelage of public officials,\r\nresponsible to a public opinion which has not yet been sufficiently\r\nnationalized in spirit or in purpose, and in case this tutelage fails of\r\nits object (as it assuredly will) the responsibility for the failure\r\nwill be divided. The corporation manager will blame the commissions for\r\nvexatious, blundering, and disheartening interference. The commissions\r\nwill blame the corporation manager for lack of cordial coöperation. The\r\nresult will be either the abandonment of the experiment or the\r\nsubstitution of some degree of public ownership. But in either event the\r\nconstructive economic work of the past two generations will be in some\r\nmeasure undone; and the American economic advance will be to that extent\r\nretarded. Such obnoxious regulation has been not unjustly compared to\r\nthe attempt to discipline a somewhat too vivacious bull by the simple\r\nprocess of castration. For it must be substituted an economic policy\r\nwhich will secure to the nation, and the individual the opportunities\r\nand the benefits of the existing organization, while at the same time\r\nseeking the diffusion of those benefits over a larger social area.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE FRUITS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe only sound point of departure for a national economic policy is, as\r\nwe have seen, the acceptance by the state of certain of the results of\r\ncorporate industrial organization. Such state recognition is equivalent\r\nto discrimination in their favor, because it leaves them in possession\r\nof those fundamental economic advantages, dependent on terminals, large\r\ncapital, and natural resources, which place them beyond effective\r\ncompetition; and the state has good reason to suffer this\r\ndiscrimination, because a wise government can always make more social\r\ncapital out of a coöperative industrial organization than it can out of\r\nan extremely competitive one.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely improbable that, even when officially recognized in this\r\nway, the process of corporate combination would go beyond a certain\r\npoint. It might result in a condition similar to that which now prevails\r\nin the steel industry or that of sugar refining; but it should be added\r\nthat in industries organized to that extent there is not very much\r\ncompetition in prices. Prices are usually regulated by agreement among\r\nthe leading producers; and competition among the several producers turns\r\nupon quickness of delivery and the quality of the service or product.\r\nWhether or not this restriction of competition works badly depends\r\nusually upon the enlightened shrewdness with which the schedule of rates\r\nand prices is fixed. A corporation management which was thoroughly alive\r\nto its own interest would endeavor to arrange a scale of prices, which,\r\nwhile affording a sufficient profit, would encourage the increased use\r\nof the product, and that is precisely the policy which has been adopted\r\nby the best managed American railroad and industrial corporations. But\r\nit must always be kept in mind that, in the absence of a certain amount\r\nof competition, such a policy cannot be taken wholly for granted. A\r\nshort-sighted management may prefer to reap large profits for a short\r\ntime and at the expense of the increased use of its product or service.\r\nMoreover, the margin between the cost of production and the particular\r\nprice at which the product or service can be sold consistent with its\r\nlargely increasing use may enable the producer to gather enormous\r\nprofits; and such profits may not stimulate competition to any\r\neffective extent, precisely because they depend upon advantages in\r\nproduction which cannot be duplicated. No state desirous of promoting\r\nthe economic welfare of its citizens can remain indifferent to the\r\nchance thus afforded of earnings disproportionately large to the\r\neconomic service actually rendered.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this question of possibly excessive profits under such a\r\nmethod of economic organization, the state has many resources at its\r\ndisposal besides the most obvious one of incessant official interference\r\nwith the essentials of corporation management. Of these the most useful\r\nconsists unquestionably in its power of taxation. It can constitute a\r\nsystem of taxation, in respect to the semi-monopolistic corporations,\r\nwhich would deprive them of the fruits of an excessively large margin\r\nbetween the cost of production and the price at which the product or\r\nservice could be increasingly sold. Net profits could be taxed at a rate\r\nwhich was graduated to the percentage paid; and beyond a certain point\r\nthe tax should amount to much the larger fraction of the profits. In\r\nthis way a semi-monopolistic corporation would not have any interest in\r\nseeking profits beyond a certain percentage. A condition would be\r\nestablished which, while it would not deprive the managers of a\r\ncorporation of full responsibility for the conduct of its business,\r\nwould give them an additional inducement always to work for the\r\npermanent improvement of the economic relation of the corporation to the\r\ncommunity. They would have no interest in preferring large but insecure\r\nnet earnings to smaller ones, founded on a thoroughly satisfactory\r\nservice, a low schedule of prices, and the constantly increasing\r\nefficiency of the plant and organization of the company.\r\n\r\nThe objection will, no doubt, be immediately urged that a system of this\r\nkind would prevent any improvement of service from going beyond a\r\ncertain point, just because it would cease to be profitable beyond a\r\ncertain point. But such an objection would not be valid, provided the\r\nscale of taxation were properly graduated. I shall not attempt to define\r\nany precise scale which would serve the purpose because the possible\r\nadoption of such a plan is still too remote; but the state should, in\r\nreturn for the protection it extends to these semi-monopolistic\r\ncorporations, take a certain percentage of all profits, and, while this\r\npercentage should increase until it might at a certain level reach as\r\nmuch as one half or three quarters, it should not become larger than\r\nthree quarters--except in the case of a corporation earning, say, more\r\nthan 20 per cent on its capital. To be sure the establishment even of\r\nsuch a level would conceivably destroy the interested motive for\r\nincreased efficiency at a certain point, but such a point could hardly\r\nbe reached except in the case of companies whose monopoly was almost\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing plan, however, is not suggested as a final and entirely\r\nsatisfactory method of incorporating semi-monopolistic business\r\norganizations into the economic system of a nationalizing democracy. I\r\ndo not believe that any formula can be framed which will by the magic of\r\nsome chemical process convert a purely selfish economic motive into an\r\nunqualified public economic benefit. But some such plan as that proposed\r\nabove may enable an industrial democracy to get over the period of\r\ntransition between the partial and the complete adaptation of these\r\ncompanies to their place in a system of national economy. They can never\r\nbe completely incorporated so long as the interest of their owners is\r\ndifferent from that of the community as a whole, but in the meantime\r\nthey can be encouraged to grow and perhaps to become more efficient,\r\nwhile at the same time they can be prevented from becoming a source of\r\nundesirable or dangerous individual economic inequalities; and I do not\r\nbelieve that such a transitional system of automatically regulated\r\nrecognition would be open to the same objections as would a system of\r\nincessant official interference. In so far, indeed, as the constructive\r\nindustrial leader is actuated merely by the motive of amassing more\r\nmillions than can be of any possible use to himself or his children--in\r\nso far as such is the case, the inducement to American industrial\r\norganization on a national scale would be impaired. But if an economic\r\ndemocracy can purchase efficient industrial organization on a huge scale\r\nonly at the price of this class of fortunes, then it must be content\r\nwith a lower order of efficiency, and American economic statesmanship\r\nhas every reason to reject such an alternative until there is no help\r\nfor it. The best type of American millionaire seems always to have had\r\nas much interest in the work and in the game as in its prodigious\r\nrewards; and much of his work has always been done for him by employees\r\nwho, while they were paid liberally, did not need the inducement of more\r\nmoney than they could wholesomely spend in return, for service of the\r\nhighest efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn any event the plan of an automatically regulated recognition of\r\nsemi-monopolistic corporations would be intended only as a transitional\r\nmeasure. Its object would be to give these somewhat novel industrial\r\nagents a more prolonged and thorough test than any they have yet\r\nreceived. If they survived for some generations and increased in\r\nefficiency and strength, it could only be because the advantages they\r\nenjoyed in the way of natural resources, abundant capital, organization,\r\nterminals, and responsible management were decisive and permanent; and\r\nin that case the responsibility of the state could not be limited to\r\ntheir automatic regulation and partial assimilation. A policy must be\r\nadopted of converting them into express economic agents of the whole\r\ncommunity, and of gradually appropriating for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity the substantial economic advantages which these corporations\r\nhad succeeded in acquiring. Just in so far, that is, as a monopoly or a\r\nsemi-monopoly succeeded in surviving and growing, it would partake of\r\nthe character of a natural monopoly, and would be in a position to\r\nprofit beyond its deserts from the growth of the community. In that\r\nevent a community which had any idea of making economic responsibility\r\ncommensurate with power would be obliged to adopt a policy of gradual\r\nappropriation.\r\n\r\nThe public service corporations in the large cities have already reached\r\nthe stage of being recognized natural monopolies. In the case of these\r\ncorporations public opinion is pretty well agreed that a monopoly\r\ncontrolling the whole service is more likely to be an efficient servant\r\nof the city than a number of separate corporations, among whom\r\ncompetition in order to be effective must be destructive and wasteful.\r\nAmerican municipal policy is consequently being adapted to the idea of\r\nmonopolized control of these public services. The best manner of dealing\r\nwith these monopolies, after they have been created and recognized, is\r\nnot settled by any means to the same extent; but the principle of\r\nrestricting the franchises under which they operate to a limited term of\r\nyears is well established, and the tendency is towards a constant\r\nreduction of the length of such leases and towards the retention of a\r\nright of purchase, exercisable at all or at certain stated times. The\r\nAmerican city has come to realize that such privileges possess a value\r\nwhich increases automatically with the growth of the city and with the\r\nguarantee against competition; and this source of value should never be\r\nalienated except for a short period and on the most stringent terms.\r\nWherever, consequently, a city has retained any control over such\r\nfranchises, it is converting the public service corporations merely into\r\ntemporary tenants of what are essentially exclusive economic privileges.\r\nDuring the period of its tenancy the management of a corporation has\r\nfull opportunity to display any ability and energy whereof it may be\r\npossessed; and such peculiarly efficient management should be capable of\r\nearning sufficient if not excessive rewards. In the meantime, any\r\nincrease in value which would result inevitably from the possession of a\r\nmonopoly in a growing community would accrue, as it should, to the\r\ncommunity itself.\r\n\r\nThe only alternative to such a general scheme of municipal policy in\r\nrelation to public service corporations would be one of municipal\r\noperation as well as municipal ownership; and municipal operation\r\nunquestionably has certain theoretical advantages. When a corporation\r\nenjoys a tenancy for a stated term only, there is always a danger that\r\nit will seek temporarily larger profits by economizing on the quality of\r\nits service. It has not the same interest in building up a permanently\r\nprofitable business that it would in case it were owner as well as\r\noperator. This divergence of interest may lead to a good deal of\r\nfriction; but for the present at least the mixed system of public\r\nownership and private operation offers the better chance of satisfactory\r\nresults. As long as the municipal civil service remains in its existing\r\ndisorganized and inefficient condition, the public administration should\r\nnot be granted any direct responsibility which can be withheld without\r\nendangering an essential public interest. A system of public operation\r\nwould be preferable to one of divided personal responsibility between\r\npublic and private officials; but when a mixed system can be created\r\nwhich sharply distinguishes the two responsibilities one from another\r\nwithout in any way confusing them, it combines for the time being a\r\nmaximum of merit with a minimum of friction.\r\n\r\nSuch a system carries with it, however, two results, not always\r\nappreciated. A municipality which embarks upon a policy of guaranteeing\r\nmonopolies and leasing the enjoyment thereof should make all permanent\r\nimprovements to the system at its own expense, and its financial\r\norganization and methods must be adapted to the necessity of raising a\r\nliberal supply of funds for such essential purposes. Its borrowing\r\ncapacity must not be arbitrarily restricted as in the case of so many\r\nAmerican cities at the present time; and, of course, any particular\r\nlease must be arranged so as to provide not only the interest on the\r\nmoney raised for all work of construction, but for the extinction of the\r\ndebt thereby incurred. Furthermore a city adopting such a policy should\r\npush it to the limit. Wherever, as is so often the case, private\r\ncompanies now enjoy a complete or a substantial monopoly of any service,\r\nand do so by virtue of permanent franchises, every legal means should be\r\ntaken to nullify such an intolerable appropriation of the resources of\r\nthe community. Persistent and ruthless war should be declared upon these\r\nunnatural monopolies, because as long as they exist they are an absolute\r\nbar to any thoroughly democratic and constructive system of municipal\r\neconomy. Measures should be taken which under other circumstances would\r\nbe both unfair and unwise for the deliberate purpose of bringing them to\r\nterms, and getting them to exchange their permanent possession of these\r\nfranchises for a limited tenancy. Permanent commissions should be placed\r\nover them with the right and duty of interfering officiously in their\r\nbusiness. Taxation should be made to bear heavily upon them. Competitive\r\nservices should be established wherever this could be done without any\r\nexcessive loss. They should be annoyed and worried in every legal way;\r\nand all those burdens should be imposed upon them with the explicit\r\nunderstanding that they were measures of war. In adopting such a policy\r\na community would be fighting for an essential condition of future\r\neconomic integrity and well-being, and it need not be any more\r\nscrupulous about the means employed (always \"under the law\") than would\r\nan animal in his endeavor to kill some blood-sucking parasite. The\r\ncorporation should plainly be told that the fight would be abandoned\r\nwherever it was ready to surrender its unlimited franchises for a\r\nlimited but exclusive monopoly, which in these cases should in all\r\nfairness run for a longer term than would be ordinarily permissible.\r\n\r\nI have lingered over the case of corporations enjoying municipal\r\nfranchises, because they offer the only existing illustration of a\r\nspecific economic situation--a situation in which a monopolized service\r\nis based upon exclusive and permanent economic advantages. Precisely the\r\nsame situation does not exist in any other part of the economic area;\r\nbut the idea is that under a policy of properly regulated recognition\r\nsuch a situation may come to exist in respect to those corporations\r\nwhich should be subject to the jurisdiction of the central government;\r\nand just in so far as it does come to exist, the policy of the central\r\ngovernment should resemble the one suggested for the municipal\r\ngovernments and already occasionally adopted by them. That any\r\ncorporations properly subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal\r\ngovernment will attain to the condition of being a \"natural\" monopoly\r\nmay be disputed; but according to the present outlook, if such is not\r\nthe case, the only reason will be that the government by means of\r\nofficial and officious interference \"regulates\" them into inefficiency,\r\nand consequent inability to hold their own against smaller and less\r\n\"regulated\" competitors. If these corporations are left in the enjoyment\r\nof the natural advantages which wisely or unwisely they have been\r\nallowed to appropriate, some of them at any rate will gradually attain\r\nto the economic standing of \"natural\" monopolies.\r\n\r\nThe railroad system of the country is gradually approximating to such a\r\ncondition. The process of combination which has been characteristic of\r\nAmerican railroad development from the start has been checked recently\r\nboth by government action and by anti-railroad agitation; but if the\r\nrailroads were exempted from the provisions of the Anti-Trust Law and\r\nwere permitted, subject to official approval, either to make agreements\r\nor to merge, according as they were competing or non-competing lines,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the whole country would be gradually divided\r\nup among certain large and essentially non-competitive systems. A\r\nmeasure of competition would always remain, even if one corporation\r\ncontrolled the entire railway system, because the varying and\r\nconflicting demands of different localities and businesses for changes\r\nin rates would act as a competitive force; and in the probable system\r\nof a division of territory, this competitive force would have still more\r\ninfluence. But at the same time by far the larger part of the freight\r\nand passenger traffic of the country would under such a system be shared\r\nby arrangement among the several corporations. The ultimate share of\r\neach of the big corporations would not be determined until the period of\r\nbuilding new through routes had passed. But this period is not likely to\r\nendure for more than another generation. Thereafter additional railroad\r\nconstruction will be almost exclusively a matter of branch extensions\r\nand connections, or of duplicating tracks already in existence; and when\r\nsuch a situation is reached, the gross traffic will be just as much\r\ndivided among the coöperative companies as if it were distributed among\r\ndifferent lines by a central management. Certain lines would be managed\r\nmore efficiently than others and might make more money, just as certain\r\ndepartments of a big business might, because of peculiarly able\r\nmanagement, earn an unusually large contribution to the total profits;\r\nbut such variations could not be of any essential importance. From the\r\npoint of view of the community as a whole the railroad system of the\r\ncountry would be a monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe monopoly, like that of a municipal street railroad, would depend\r\nupon the possession of exclusive advantages. It would depend upon the\r\nownership of terminals in large and small cities which could no longer\r\nbe duplicated save at an excessive expense. It would depend upon the\r\npossession of a right of way in relation to which the business\r\narrangements of a particular territory had been adjusted. It would have\r\nbecome essentially a special franchise, even if it had not been granted\r\nas a special franchise by any competent legal authority; and, like every\r\nsimilar franchise, it would increase automatically in value with the\r\ngrowth of the community in population and business. This automatic\r\nincrease in value, like that of a municipal franchise, should be secured\r\nto the community which creates it; and it can be secured only by some\r\nsuch means as those suggested in the case of municipal franchises. The\r\nFederal government must, that is, take possession of that share of\r\nrailroad property represented by the terminals, the permanent right of\r\nway, the tracks, and the stations. It is property of this kind which\r\nenables the railroads to become a monopoly, and which, if left in\r\nprivate hands, would absolutely prevent the gradual construction of a\r\nnational economic system.\r\n\r\nIn the existing condition of economic development and of public opinion,\r\nthe man who believes in the ultimate necessity of government ownership\r\nof railroad road-beds and terminals must be content to wait and to\r\nwatch. The most that he can do for the present is to use any opening,\r\nwhich the course of railroad development affords, for the assertion of\r\nhis ideas; and if he is right, he will gradually be able to work out, in\r\nrelation to the economic situation of the railroads, some practical\r\nmethod of realizing the ultimate purpose. Even if public opinion\r\neventually decided that the appropriation of the railroads was necessary\r\nin the national economic interest, the end could in all probability be\r\nvery slowly realized. In return, for instance, for the benefit of\r\ngovernment credit, granted under properly regulated conditions, the\r\nrailroads might submit to the operation of some gradual system of\r\nappropriation, which would operate only in the course of several\r\ngenerations, and the money for which would be obtained by the taxation\r\nof railroad earnings. It might, however, be possible to arrange a scheme\r\nof immediate purchase and the conversion of all railway securities,\r\nexcept those representing equipment and working capital, into one\r\nspecial class of government security. In that case the whole railroad\r\nsystem of the country could be organized into a certain limited number\r\nof special systems, which could be leased for a definite term of years\r\nto private corporations. These independent systems would in their mutual\r\nrelations stimulate that economic rivalry among localities which is the\r\nwholesome aspect of railroad competition. Each of these companies\r\nshould, of course, be free to fix such rates as were considered\r\nnecessary for the proper development and distribution of traffic within\r\nits own district.\r\n\r\nAny such specific suggestions cannot at the present time be other than\r\nfanciful; and they are offered, not because of their immediate or\r\nproximate practical value, but because of the indication they afford of\r\nthe purposes which must be kept in mind in drawing up a radical plan of\r\nrailroad reorganization in the ultimate national interest. All such\r\nplans of reorganization should carefully respect existing railroad\r\nproperty values, unless the management of those railroads obstinately\r\nand uncompromisingly opposed all concessions necessary to the\r\nrealization of the national interest. In that event the nation would be\r\nas much justified in fighting for its essential interests as would under\r\nanalogous circumstances a municipality. Furthermore, any such\r\nreorganization should aim at keeping the benefits of the then existing\r\nprivate organization--whatever they might be. It should remain true to\r\nthe principle that, so far as economic authority and power is delegated\r\nin the form of terminable leases to private corporations, such power\r\nshould be complete within certain defined limits. If agents of the\r\nnational economic interest cannot be trusted to fulfill their\r\nresponsibilities without some system of detailed censure and supervision\r\nthey should be entirely dispensed with. It may be added that if the\r\nproposed or any kindred method of reorganization becomes politically and\r\neconomically possible, the circumstances which account for its\r\npossibility will in all probability carry with them some practicable\r\nmethod of realizing the proposed object.\r\n\r\nWherever the conditions, obtaining in the case of railroad and public\r\nservice corporations, are duplicated in that of an industrial\r\ncorporation, a genuinely national economic system would demand the\r\nadoption of similar measures. How far or how often these measures would\r\nbe necessarily applied to industrial corporations could be learned only\r\nafter a long period of experimentation, and during this period the\r\npolicy of recognition, tempered by regulation under definite conditions\r\nand graduated taxation of net profits would have to be applied. But when\r\nsuch a policy had been applied for a period sufficiently prolonged to\r\ntest their value as national economic agents, further action might\r\nbecome desirable in their case as in that of the railroads. The\r\nindustrial, unlike the service corporations, cannot, however, be\r\nconsidered as belonging to a class which must be all treated in the same\r\nway. Conditions would vary radically in different industries; and the\r\ncase of each industry should be considered in relation to its special\r\nconditions. Wherever the tendency in any particular industry continued\r\nto run in the direction of combination, and wherever the increasingly\r\ncentralized control of that industry was associated with a practical\r\nmonopoly of some mineral, land, or water rights, the government might be\r\nconfronted by another instance of a natural monopoly, which it would be\r\nimpolitic and dangerous to leave in private hands. In all such cases\r\nsome system of public ownership and private operation should, if\r\npossible, be introduced. On the other hand, in case the tendency to\r\ncombination was strengthened in an industry, such, for instance, as that\r\nof the manufacture of tobacco, which does not depend upon the actual\r\nownership of any American natural resources, the manner of dealing with\r\nit would be a matter of expediency, which would vary in different cases.\r\nIn the case of a luxury like tobacco, either a government monopoly might\r\nbe created, as has been already done so frequently abroad, or the state\r\nmight be satisfied with a sufficient share of the resulting profits. No\r\ngeneral rule can be laid down for such cases; and they will not come up\r\nfor serious consideration until the more fundamental question of the\r\nrailroads has been agitated to the point of compelling some kind of a\r\ndefinite settlement.\r\n\r\nThis sketch of a constructive national policy in relation to\r\ncorporations need not be carried any further. Its purpose has been to\r\nconvert to the service of a national democratic economic system the\r\nindustrial organization which has gradually been built up in this\r\ncountry; and to make this conversion, if possible, without impairing the\r\nefficiency of the system, and without injuring individuals in any\r\nunnecessary way. The attempt will be criticised, of course, as\r\nabsolutely destructive of American economic efficiency and as wickedly\r\nunjust to individuals; and there will be, from the point of view of the\r\ncritics, some truth in the criticism. No such reorganization of our\r\nindustrial methods could be effected without a prolonged period of\r\nagitation, which would undoubtedly injure the prosperity and unsettle\r\nthe standing of the victims of the agitation; and no matter what the\r\nresults of the agitation, there must be individual loss and suffering.\r\nBut there is a distinction to be made between industrial efficiency and\r\nbusiness prosperity. Americans have hitherto identified prosperity with\r\na furious economic activity, and an ever-increasing economic\r\nproduct--regardless of genuine economy of production and any proper\r\ndistribution of the fruits. Unquestionably, the proposed reorganization\r\nof American industrial methods would for a while make many individual\r\nAmericans less prosperous. But it does not follow that the efficiency of\r\nthe national economic organization need be compromised, because its\r\nfruits are differently distributed and are temporarily less abundant.\r\nIt is impossible to judge at present how far that efficiency depends\r\nupon the chance, which Americans have enjoyed, of appropriating far more\r\nmoney than they have earned, and far more than they can spend except\r\neither by squandering it or giving it away. But in any event the\r\ndangerous lack of national economic balance involved by the existing\r\ndistribution of wealth must be redressed. This object is so essential\r\nthat its attainment is worth the inevitable attendant risks. In seeking\r\nto bring it about, no clear-sighted democratic economist would expect to\r\n\"have it both ways.\" Even a very gradual displacement of the existing\r\nmethod of distributing economic fruits will bring with it regrettable\r\nwounds and losses. But provided they are incurred for the benefit of the\r\nAmerican people as an economic whole, they are worth the penalty. The\r\nnational economic interest demands, on the one hand, the combination of\r\nabundant individual opportunity with efficient organization, and on the\r\nother, a wholesome distribution, of the fruits; and these joint\r\nessentials will be more certainly attained under some such system as the\r\none suggested than they are under the present system.\r\n\r\nThe genuine economic interest of the individual, like the genuine\r\npolitical interest, demands a distribution of economic power and\r\nresponsibility, which will enable men of exceptional ability an\r\nexceptional opportunity of exercising it. Industrial leaders, like\r\npolitical leaders, should be content with the opportunity of doing\r\nefficient work, and with a scale of reward which permits them to live a\r\ncomplete human life. At present the opportunity of doing efficient\r\nindustrial work is in the case of the millionaires (not in that of their\r\nequally or more efficient employees) accompanied by an excessive measure\r\nof reward, which is, in the moral interest of the individual, either\r\nmeaningless or corrupting. The point at which these rewards cease to be\r\nearned is a difficult one to define; but there certainly can be no\r\ninjustice in appropriating for the community those increases in value\r\nwhich are due merely to a general increase in population and business;\r\nand this increase in value should be taken over by the community, no\r\nmatter whether it is divided among one hundred or one hundred thousand\r\nstockholders in a corporation. The essential purpose is to secure for\r\nthe whole community those elements in value which are made by the\r\ncommunity. The semi-monopolistic organization of certain American\r\nindustries is little by little enabling the government to separate from\r\nthe total economic product a part at least of that fraction which is\r\ncreated by social rather than individual activity; and a democracy which\r\nfailed to take advantage of the opportunity would be blind to its\r\nfundamental interest. To be sure, the opportunity cannot be turned to\r\nthe utmost public benefit until industrial leaders, like political\r\nleaders, are willing to do efficient work partly from disinterested\r\nmotives; but that statement is merely a translation into economic terms\r\nof the fundamental truth that democracy, as a political and social\r\nideal, is founded essentially upon disinterested human action. A\r\ndemocracy can disregard or defy that truth at its peril.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTAXATION AND INEQUALITIES IN WEALTH\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing this subject of a national industrial organization and\r\na better distribution of the fruits thereof brief references must be\r\nmade to certain other aspects of the matter. The measures which the\r\ncentral and local governments could take for the purpose of adapting our\r\neconomic and social institutions to the national economic and social\r\ninterest would not be exhausted by the adoption of the proposed policy\r\nof reconstruction; and several of these supplementary means, which have\r\nbeen proposed to accomplish the same object, deserve consideration. Some\r\nof these proposals look towards a further use of the power of taxation,\r\npossessed by both the state and the Federal governments; but it must not\r\nbe supposed that in their entirety they constitute a complete system of\r\ntaxation. They are merely examples, like the protective tariff, of the\r\nuse of the power of taxation to combine a desirable national object with\r\nthe raising of money for the expenses of government.\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed that the adoption of the policy outlined in the last\r\nsection would gradually do away with certain undesirable inequalities in\r\nthe distribution of wealth: but this process, it is scarcely necessary\r\nto add, would do nothing to mitigate existing inequalities. Existing\r\ninequalities ought to be mitigated; and they can be mitigated without\r\ndoing the slightest injustice to their owners. The means to such\r\nmitigation are, of course, to be found in a graduated inheritance tax--a\r\ntax which has already been accepted in principle by several American\r\nstates and by the English government, which certainly cannot be\r\nconsidered indifferent to the rights of individual property owners.\r\n\r\nAt the present stage of the argument, no very elaborate justification\r\ncan be necessary, either for the object proposed by a graduated\r\ninheritance tax, or for the use of precisely these means to attain it.\r\nThe preservation intact of a fortune over a certain amount is not\r\ndesirable either in the public or individual interest. No doubt there\r\nare certain people who have the gift of spending money well, and whose\r\npersonal value as well as the general social interest is heightened by\r\nthe opportunity of being liberal. But to whatever extent such\r\nconsiderations afford a moral justification for private property, they\r\nhave no relevancy to the case of existing American fortunes. The\r\nmulti-millionaire cannot possibly spend his income save by a recourse to\r\nwild and demoralizing extravagance, and in some instances not even\r\nextravagance is sufficient for the purpose. Fortunes of a certain size\r\neither remorselessly accumulate or else are given away. There is a\r\ngeneral disposition to justify the possession of many millions by the\r\nfrequent instances among their owners of intelligent public benefaction,\r\nbut such an argument is a confession that a justification is needed\r\nwithout constituting in itself a sufficient excuse. If wealth,\r\nparticularly when accumulated in large amounts, has a public function,\r\nand if its possession imposes a public duty, a society is foolish to\r\nleave such a duty to the accidental good intentions of individuals. It\r\nshould be assumed and should be efficiently performed by the state; and\r\nthe necessity of that assumption is all the plainer when it is\r\nremembered that the greatest public gifts usually come from the first\r\ngeneration of millionaires. Men who inherit great wealth and are brought\r\nup in extravagant habits nearly always spend their money on themselves.\r\nThat is one reason why the rich Englishman is so much less generous in\r\nhis public gifts than the rich American. In the long run men inevitably\r\nbecome the victims of their wealth. They adapt their lives and habits to\r\ntheir money, not their money to their lives. It pre-occupies their\r\nthoughts, creates artificial needs, and draws a curtain between them and\r\nthe world. If the American people believe that large wealth really\r\nrequires to be justified by proportionately large public benefactions,\r\nthey should assuredly adopt measures which will guarantee public service\r\nfor a larger proportion of such wealth.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the state shall permit the inheritance of large fortunes\r\nis a question which stands on a totally different footing from the\r\nquestion of their permissible accumulation. Many millions may, at least\r\nin part, be earned by the men who accumulate them; but they cannot in\r\nthe least be earned by the people who inherit them. They could not be\r\ninherited at all save by the intervention of the state; and the state\r\nhas every right to impose conditions in its own interest upon the whole\r\nbusiness of inheritance. The public interests involved go very much\r\nbeyond the matter of mitigating flagrant inequalities of wealth. They\r\nconcern at bottom the effect of the present system of inheritance upon\r\nthe inheritors and upon society; and in so far as the system brings with\r\nit the creation of a class of economic parasites, it can scarcely be\r\ndefended. But such is precisely its general tendency. The improbability\r\nthat the children will inherit with the wealth of the parent his\r\npossibly able and responsible use of it is usually apparent to the\r\nfather himself; and not infrequently he ties up his millions in trust,\r\nso that they are sure to have the worst possible moral effect upon his\r\nheirs. Children so circumstanced are deprived of any economic\r\nresponsibility save that of spending an excessive income; and, of\r\ncourse, they are bound to become more or less respectable parasites. The\r\nmanifest dissociation thereby implied between the enjoyment of wealth\r\nand the personal responsibility attending its ownership, has resulted in\r\nthe proposal that fathers should be forbidden by the state to arrange so\r\ncarefully for the demoralization of their children and grandchildren.\r\nEven if we are not prepared to acquiesce in so radical an impairment of\r\nthe rights of testators, there can be no doubt that, under a properly\r\nframed system of inheritance taxation, all property placed in trust for\r\nthe benefit of male heirs above a certain amount should be subject to an\r\nexceptionally severe deduction. Whatever justification such methods of\r\nguaranteeing personal financial irresponsibility may have in\r\naristocratic countries, in which an upper class may need a peculiar\r\neconomic freedom, they are hostile both to the individual and public\r\ninterest of a democratic community.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is not, however, even remotely prepared for any radical\r\ntreatment of the whole matter of inheritance; and it will not be\r\nprepared, until it has learned from experience that the existing freedom\r\nenjoyed by rich testators means the sacrifice of the quick to the\r\ndead--the mutilation of living individuals in the name of individual\r\nfreedom and in order that a dead will may have its way. Until this\r\nlesson is learned the most that can be done is to work for some kind of\r\na graduated inheritance tax, the severity of which should be dictated\r\nchiefly by conditions of practical efficiency. Considerations of\r\npractical efficiency make it necessary that the tax should be imposed\r\nexclusively by the Federal government. State inheritance taxes,\r\nsufficiently large to accomplish the desirable result, will be evaded by\r\nchange of residence to another state. A Federal tax could be raised to a\r\nmuch higher level without prompting the two possible methods of\r\nevasion--one of which would be the legal transfer of the property during\r\nlifetime, and the other a complete change of residence to some foreign\r\ncountry. This second method of evasion would not constitute a serious\r\ndanger, because of the equally severe inheritance laws of foreign\r\ncountries. The tax at its highest level could be placed without danger\r\nof evasion at as much as twenty per cent. The United Kingdom now raises\r\nalmost $100,000,000 of revenue from the source; and a slightly increased\r\nscale of taxation might yield double that amount to the American\r\nTreasury, a part of which could be turned into the state Treasuries.\r\n\r\nThere has been associated with the graduated inheritance tax the plan of\r\na graduated income tax; but the graduated income tax would serve the\r\nproposed object both less efficiently and less equitably. It taxes the\r\nman who earns the money as well as him who inherits it. It taxes earned\r\nincome as well as income derived from investments; and in taxing the\r\nincome derived from investments, it cannot make any edifying\r\ndiscrimination as to its source. Finally, it would interfere with a much\r\nmore serviceable plan of taxing the net profits of corporations subject\r\nto the jurisdiction of the Federal government--a plan which is an\r\nindispensable part of any constructive treatment of the corporation\r\nproblem in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the inheritance tax should constitute a pillar of\r\ncentral rather than local taxation implicitly raises a whole series of\r\ndifficult Constitutional and fiscal questions concerning the relation\r\nbetween central and local taxation. The discussion of these questions\r\nwould carry me very much further than my present limits permit; and\r\nthere is room in this connection for only one additional remark. The\r\nreal estate tax and saloon licenses should, I believe, constitute the\r\nfoundation of the state revenues; but inasmuch as certain states have\r\nderived a considerable part of their income from corporation and\r\ninheritance taxes, allowance would have to be made for this fact in\r\nrevising the methods of Federal taxation. It is essential to any\r\neffective control over corporations and over the \"money power\" that\r\ncorporation and inheritance taxes should be uniform throughout the\r\ncountry, and should be laid by the central government; but no equally\r\ngood reason can be urged on behalf of the exclusive appropriation by the\r\nFederal Treasury of the proceeds of these taxes. If the states need\r\nrevenues derived from these sources, a certain proportion of the net\r\nreceipts could be distributed among the states. The proportion should be\r\nthe same in the case of all the states; but it should be estimated in\r\nthe case of any particular state upon the net yield which the Federal\r\nTreasury had derived from its residents.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF LABOR\r\n\r\nOnly one essential phase of a constructive national policy remains to be\r\nconsidered--and that is the organization of labor. The necessity for the\r\nformulation of some constructive policy in respect to labor is as patent\r\nas is that for the formulation of a similar policy in respect to\r\ncorporate wealth. Any progress in the solution of the problem of the\r\nbetter distribution of wealth will, of course, have a profound indirect\r\neffect on the amelioration of the condition of labor; but such progress\r\nwill be at best extremely slow, and in the meantime the labor problem\r\npresses for some immediate and direct action. As we have seen, American\r\nlabor has not been content with the traditional politico-economic\r\noptimism. Like all aggressive men alive to their own interest, the\r\nlaborer soon decided that what he really needed was not equal rights,\r\nbut special opportunities. He also soon learned that in order to get\r\nthese special opportunities he must conquer them by main force--which he\r\nproceeded to do with, on the whole, about as much respect for the law as\r\nwas exhibited by the big capitalists. In spite of many setbacks the\r\nunionizing of industrial labor has been attended with almost as much\r\nsuccess as the consolidating of industrial power and wealth; and now\r\nthat the labor unions have earned the allegiance of their members by\r\ncertain considerable and indispensable services, they find themselves\r\nplaced, in the eyes of the law, in precisely the same situation as\r\ncombinations of corporate wealth. Both of these attempts at industrial\r\norganization are condemned by the Sherman Anti-Trust Law and by certain\r\nsimilar state legislation as conspiracies against the freedom of trade\r\nand industry.\r\n\r\nThe labor unions, consequently, like the big corporations, need legal\r\nrecognition; and this legal recognition means in their case, also,\r\nsubstantial discrimination by the state in their favor. Of course, the\r\nunionist leaders appeal to public opinion with the usual American cant.\r\nAccording to their manifestoes they demand nothing but \"fair play\"; but\r\nthe demand for fair play is as usual merely the hypocritical exterior of\r\na demand for substantial favoritism. Just as there can be no effective\r\ncompetition between the huge corporation controlling machinery of\r\nproduction which cannot be duplicated and the small manufacturer in the\r\nsame line, so there can be no effective competition between the\r\nindividual laborer and the really efficient labor union. To recognize\r\nthe labor union, and to incorporate it into the American legal system,\r\nis equivalent to the desertion by the state of the non-union laborer. It\r\nmeans that in the American political and economic system the\r\norganization of labor into unions should be preferred to its\r\ndisorganized separation into competing individuals. Complete freedom of\r\ncompetition among laborers, which is often supposed to be for the\r\ninterest of the individual laborer, can only be preserved as an\r\neffective public policy by active discrimination against the unions.\r\n\r\nAn admission that the recognition of labor unions amounts to a\r\nsubstantial discrimination in their favor would do much to clear up the\r\nwhole labor question. So far as we declare that the labor unions ought\r\nto be recognized, we declare that they ought to be favored; and so far\r\nas we declare that the labor union ought to be favored, we have made a\r\ngreat advance towards the organization of labor in the national\r\ninterest. The labor unions deserve to be favored, because they are the\r\nmost effective machinery which has as yet been forged for the economic\r\nand social amelioration of the laboring class. They have helped to raise\r\nthe standard of living, to mitigate the rigors of competition among\r\nindividual laborers, and in this way to secure for labor a larger share\r\nof the total industrial product. A democratic government has little or\r\nless reason to interfere on behalf of the non-union laborer than it has\r\nto interfere in favor of the small producer. As a type the non-union\r\nlaborer is a species of industrial derelict. He is the laborer who has\r\ngone astray and who either from apathy, unintelligence, incompetence, or\r\nsome immediately pressing need prefers his own individual interest to\r\nthe joint interests of himself and his fellow-laborers. From the point\r\nof view of a constructive national policy he does not deserve any\r\nspecial protection. In fact, I am willing to go farther and assert that\r\nthe non-union industrial laborer should, in the interest of a genuinely\r\ndemocratic organization of labor, be rejected; and he should be rejected\r\nas emphatically, if not as ruthlessly, as the gardener rejects the weeds\r\nin his garden for the benefit of fruit-and flower-bearing plants.\r\n\r\nThe statement just made unquestionably has the appearance of proposing a\r\nharsh and unjust policy in respect to non-union laborers; but before the\r\npolicy is stigmatized as really harsh or unjust, the reader should wait\r\nuntil he has pursued the argument to its end. Our attitude towards the\r\nnon-union laborer must be determined by our opinion of the results of\r\nhis economic action. In the majority of discussions of the labor\r\nquestion the non-union laborer is figured as the independent working man\r\nwho is asserting his right to labor when and how he prefers against the\r\ntyranny of the labor union. One of the most intelligent political and\r\nsocial thinkers in our country has gone so far as to describe them as\r\nindustrial heroes, who are fighting the battle of individual\r\nindependence against the army of class oppression. Neither is this\r\nestimate of the non-union laborer wholly without foundation. The\r\norganization and policy of the contemporary labor union being what they\r\nare, cases will occasionally and even frequently occur in which the\r\nnon-union laborer will represent the protest of an individual against\r\ninjurious restrictions imposed by the union upon his opportunities and\r\nhis work. But such cases are rare compared to the much larger number of\r\ninstances in which the non-union laborer is to be considered as\r\nessentially the individual industrial derelict. In the competition among\r\nlaboring men for work there will always be a certain considerable\r\nproportion who, in order to get some kind of work for a while, will\r\naccept almost any conditions of labor or scale of reward offered to\r\nthem. Men of this kind, either because of irresponsibility,\r\nunintelligence, or a total lack of social standards and training, are\r\ncontinually converting the competition of the labor market into a force\r\nwhich degrades the standard of living and prevents masses of their\r\nfellow-workmen from obtaining any real industrial independence. They it\r\nis who bring about the result that the most disagreeable and dangerous\r\nclasses of labor remain the poorest paid; and as long as they are\r\npermitted to have their full effects upon the labor situation, progress\r\nto a higher standard of living is miserably slow and always suffers a\r\nsevere setback during a period of hard times. From any comprehensive\r\npoint of view union and not non-union labor represents the independence\r\nof the laborer, because under existing conditions such independence must\r\nbe bought by association. Worthy individuals will sometimes be\r\nsacrificed by this process of association; but every process of\r\nindustrial organization or change, even one in a constructive direction,\r\nnecessarily involves individual cases of injustice.\r\n\r\nHence it is that the policy of so-called impartiality is both\r\nimpracticable and inexpedient. The politician who solemnly declares that\r\nhe believes in the right of the laboring man to organize, and that labor\r\nunions are deserving of approval, but that he also believes in the right\r\nof the individual laborer to eschew unionism whenever it suits his\r\nindividual purpose or lack of purpose,--such familiar declarations\r\nconstitute merely one more illustration of our traditional habit of\r\n\"having it both ways.\" It is always possible to have it both ways, in\r\ncase the two ways do not come into conflict; but where they do conflict\r\nin fact and in theory, the sensible man must make his choice. The labor\r\nquestion will never be advanced towards solution by proclaiming it to be\r\na matter of antagonistic individual rights. It involves a fundamental\r\npublic interest--the interest which a democracy must necessarily take in\r\nthe economic welfare of its own citizens; and this interest demands that\r\na decisive preference be shown for labor organization. The labor unions\r\nare perfectly right in believing that all who are not for them are\r\nagainst them, and that a state which was really \"impartial\" would be\r\nadopting a hypocritical method of retarding the laborer from improving\r\nhis condition. The unions deserve frank and loyal support; and until\r\nthey obtain it, they will remain, as they are at present, merely a class\r\norganization for the purpose of extorting from the political and\r\neconomic authorities the maximum of their special interests.\r\n\r\nThe labor unions should be granted their justifiable demand for\r\nrecognition, partly because only by means of recognition can an\r\neffective fight be made against their unjustifiable demands. The large\r\nAmerican employer of labor, and the whole official politico-economic\r\nsystem, is placed upon the defensive by a refusal frankly to prefer\r\nunionism. Union labor is allowed to conquer at the sword's point a\r\npreferential treatment which should never have been refused; and the\r\nconsequence is that its victory, so far as it is victorious, is that of\r\nan industrial faction. The large employer and the state are disqualified\r\nfrom insisting on their essential and justifiable interests in respect\r\nto the organization of labor, because they have rejected a demand\r\nessential to the interest of the laborer. They have remained\r\nconsistently on the defensive; and a merely defensive policy in warfare\r\nis a losing policy. Every battle the unions win is a clear gain. Every\r\nfight which they lose means merely a temporary suspension of their\r\naggressive tactics. They lose nothing by it but a part of their\r\nequipment and prestige, which can be restored by a short period of\r\ninaction and accumulation. A few generations more of this sort of\r\nwarfare will leave the unions in substantial possession of the whole\r\narea of conflict; and their victory may well turn their heads so\r\ncompletely that its effects will be intolerable and disastrous.\r\n\r\nThe alternative policy would consist in a combination of conciliation\r\nand aggressive warfare. The spokesman of a constructive national policy\r\nin respect to the organization of labor would address the unions in some\r\nsuch words as these: \"Yes! You are perfectly right in demanding\r\nrecognition, and in demanding that none but union labor be employed in\r\nindustrial work. That demand will be granted, but only on definite\r\nterms. You should not expect an employer to recognize a union which\r\nestablishes conditions and rules of labor inimical to a desirable\r\nmeasure of individual economic distinction and independence. Your\r\nrecognition, that is, must depend upon conformity to another set of\r\nconditions, imposed in the interest of efficiency and individual\r\neconomic independence. In this respect you will be treated precisely as\r\nlarge corporations are treated. The state will recognize the kind of\r\nunion which in contributing to the interest of its members contributes\r\nalso to the general economic interest. On the other hand, it will not\r\nonly refuse to recognize a union whose rules and methods are inimical to\r\nthe public economic interest, but it will aggressively and relentlessly\r\nfight such unions. Employment will be denied to laborers who belong to\r\nunions of that character. In trades where such unions are dominant,\r\ncounter-unions will be organized, and the members of these\r\ncounter-unions alone will have any chance of obtaining work. In this way\r\nthe organization of labor like the organization of capital may gradually\r\nbe fitted into a nationalized economic system.\"\r\n\r\nThe conditions to which a \"good\" labor union ought to conform are more\r\neasily definable than the conditions to which a \"good\" trust ought to\r\nconform. In the first place the union should have the right to demand a\r\nminimum wage and a minimum working day. This minimum would vary, of\r\ncourse, in different trades, in different branches of the same trade,\r\nand in different parts of the country; and it might vary, also, at\r\ndifferent industrial seasons. It would be reached by collective\r\nbargaining between the organizations of the employer and those of the\r\nemployee. The unions would be expected to make the best terms that they\r\ncould; and under the circumstances they ought to be able to make terms\r\nas good as trade conditions would allow. These agreements would be\r\nabsolute within the limits contained in the bond. The employer should\r\nnot have to keep on his pay-roll any man who in his opinion was not\r\nworth the money; but if any man was employed, he could not be obliged to\r\nwork for less than for a certain sum. On the other hand, in return for\r\nsuch a privileged position the unions would have to abandon a number of\r\nrules upon which they now insist. Collective bargaining should establish\r\nthe minimum amount of work and pay; but the maximum of work and pay\r\nshould be left to individual arrangement. An employer should be able to\r\ngive a peculiarly able or energetic laborer as much more than the\r\nminimum wage as in his opinion the man was worth; and men might be\r\npermitted to work over-time, provided they were paid for the over-time\r\none and one half or two times as much as they were paid for an ordinary\r\nworking hour. The agreement between the employers and the union should\r\nalso provide for the terms upon which men would be admitted into the\r\nunion. The employer, if he employed only union men, should have a right\r\nto demand that the supply of labor should not be artificially\r\nrestricted, and that he could depend upon procuring as much labor as the\r\ngrowth of his business might require. Finally in all skilled trades\r\nthere should obviously be some connection between the unions and the\r\ntrade schools; and it might be in this respect that the union would\r\nenter into closest relations with the state. The state would have a\r\nmanifest interest in making the instruction in these schools of the very\r\nbest, and in furnishing it free to as many apprentices as the trade\r\nagreement permitted.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the general policy roughly sketched above will please\r\none side to the labor controversy as little as it does another. Union\r\nleaders might compare the recognition received by the unions under the\r\nproposed conditions to the recognition which the bear accords to the man\r\nwhom he hugs to death. They would probably prefer for the time being\r\ntheir existing situation--that of being on the high road to the conquest\r\nof almost unconditional submission. On the other hand, the large\r\nemployers believe with such fine heroism of conviction in the principle\r\nof competition among their employees that they dislike to surrender the\r\nadvantages of industrial freedom to the oppressive exigencies of\r\ncollective bargaining. In assuming such an attitude both sides would be\r\nright from their own class points of view. The plan is not intended to\r\nfurther the selfish interest of either the employer or the union.\r\nWhatever merits it has consist in its possible ability to promote the\r\nnational economic interest in a progressively improving general standard\r\nof living, in a higher standard of individual work, and in a general\r\nefficiency of labor. The existing system has succeeded hitherto in\r\neffecting a progressive improvement in the standard of living, but the\r\nless said the better about its effects upon labor-quality and\r\nlabor-efficiency. In the long run it looks as if the improvement in the\r\nstandard of living would be brought to an end by the accompanying\r\ninefficiency of labor. At any rate the employers are now fighting for an\r\nillusory benefit; and because they are fighting for an illusory benefit\r\nthey are enabling the unions to associate all sorts of dangerous\r\nconditions with their probable victory. The proposed plan does not do\r\naway with the necessity of a fight. The relations between labor and\r\ncapital are such that only by fighting can they reach a better\r\nunderstanding. But it asks the employers to consider carefully what they\r\nare fighting for, and whether they will not lose far more from a defeat\r\nthan they will gain from a successful defense. And it asks the unions to\r\nconsider whether a victory, gained at the expense of labor-efficiency,\r\nwill not deprive them of its fruits. Let the unions fight for something\r\nthey can keep; and let the employers fight for something they will not\r\nbe sure to lose.\r\n\r\nThe writer is fully aware of the many difficulties attending the\r\npractical application of any such policy. Indeed it could not be worked\r\nat all, unless the spirit and methods of collective bargaining between\r\nthe employers and the labor organizations were very much improved. The\r\nconsequences of a strike would be extremely serious for both of the\r\ndisputants and for the consumers. If disagreements terminating in\r\nstrikes and lock-outs remained as numerous as they are at present, there\r\nwould result both for the producer and consumer a condition of perilous\r\nand perhaps intolerable uncertitude. But this objection, although\r\nserious, is not unanswerable. The surest way in which a condition of\r\npossible warfare, founded on a genuine conflict of interest, can be\r\npermanently alleviated is to make its consequences increasingly\r\ndangerous. When the risks become very dangerous, reasonable men do not\r\nfight except on grave provocation or for some essential purpose. Such\r\nwould be the result in any industry, both the employers and laborers of\r\nwhich were completely organized. Collective bargaining would, under such\r\ncircumstances, assume a serious character; and no open fight would ensue\r\nexcept under exceptional conditions and in the event of grave and\r\nessential differences of opinion. Moreover, the state could make them\r\nstill less likely to happen by a policy of discreet supervision. Through\r\nthe passage of a law similar to the one recently enacted in the Dominion\r\nof Canada, it could assure the employers and the public that no strike\r\nwould take place until every effort had been made to reach a fair\r\nunderstanding or a compromise; and in case a strike did result, public\r\nopinion could form a just estimate of the merits of the controversy. In\r\nan atmosphere of discussion and publicity really prudent employers and\r\nlabor organizations would fight very rarely, if at all; and this result\r\nwould be the more certain, provided a consensus of public opinion\r\nexisted as the extent to which the clashing interests of the two\r\ncombatants could be fitted into the public interest. It should be\r\nclearly understood that the public interest demanded, on the one hand, a\r\nstandard of living for the laborer as high as the industrial conditions\r\nwould permit, and on the other a standard of labor-efficiency equivalent\r\nto the cost of labor and an opportunity for the exceptional individual\r\nlaborer to improve on that standard in his own interest. The whole\r\npurpose of such an organization would be the attempt to develop\r\nefficient labor and prosperous laboring men, whereas the tendency of the\r\nexisting organization is to associate the prosperity of the laboring man\r\nwith the inefficiency of labor. The employers are usually fighting not\r\nfor the purpose of developing good labor, but for the purpose of taking\r\nadvantage of poor, weak, and dependent laborers.\r\n\r\nHow far the central, state, and municipal governments could go in aiding\r\nsuch a method of organization, is a question that can only be\r\nindefinitely answered. The legislatures of many American states and\r\nmunicipalities have already shown a disposition to aid the labor unions\r\nin certain indirect ways. They seek by the passage of eight-hour and\r\nprevailing rate-of-wages laws to give an official sanction to the claims\r\nof the unions, and they do so without making any attempt to promote the\r\nparallel public interest in an increasing efficiency of labor. But these\r\neight-hour and other similar laws are frequently being declared\r\nunconstitutional by the state courts, and for the supposed benefit of\r\nindividual liberty. Without venturing on the disputed ground as to\r\nwhether such decisions are legitimate or illegitimate interpretations of\r\nconstitutional provisions, it need only be said in this, as in other\r\ninstances, that the courts are as much influenced in such decisions by a\r\npolitical theory as they are by any fidelity to the fundamental law, and\r\nthat if they continue indefinitely in the same course, they are likely\r\nto get into trouble. I shall, however, as usual, merely evade\r\nconstitutional obstacles, the full seriousness of which none but an\r\nexpert lawyer is competent to appraise. Both the state and the municipal\r\ngovernments ought, just in so far as they have the power, to give\r\npreference to union labor, but wherever possible they should also not\r\nhesitate to discriminate between \"good\" and \"bad\" unions. Such a\r\ndiscrimination would be beyond the courage of existing governments, but\r\na mild hope may be entertained that it would not be beyond the courage\r\nof the regenerated governments. The adoption of some such attitude by\r\nthe municipal and state authorities might encourage employers to make\r\nthe fight along the same lines; and wherever an employer did make the\r\nfight along those lines, he should, in his turn, receive all possible\r\nsupport. In the long run the state could hardly impose by law such a\r\nmethod of labor organization upon the industrial fabric. Unless the\r\nemployers themselves came to realize just what they could fight for with\r\nsome chance of success, and with the best general results if successful,\r\nthe state could not force him into a better understanding of the\r\nrelation between their own and the public interest. But in so far as any\r\ntendency existed among employers to recognize the unions, but to insist\r\non efficiency and individual opportunity; and in so far as any tendency\r\nexisted among the unions to recognize the necessary relation between an\r\nimproving standard of living and the efficiency of labor--then the state\r\nand municipal governments could interfere effectively on behalf of those\r\nemployers and those unions who stand for a constructive labor policy.\r\nAnd in case the tendency towards an organization of labor in the\r\nnational interest became dominant, it might be possible to embody it in\r\na set of definite legal institutions. But any such set of legal\r\ninstitutions would be impossible without an alteration in the Federal\r\nand many state constitutions; and consequently they could not in any\r\nevent become a matter for precisely pressing consideration. In general,\r\nhowever, the labor, even more than the corporation, problem will involve\r\ngrave and dubious questions of constitutional interpretation; and not\r\nmuch advance can be made towards its solution until, in one way or\r\nanother, the hands of the legislative authority have been untied.\r\n\r\nBefore ending this very inadequate discussion of the line of advance\r\ntowards a constructive organization of labor, one more aspect thereof\r\nmust be briefly considered. Under the proposed plan the fate of the\r\nnon-union laborer, of the industrial dependent, would hang chiefly on\r\nthe extent to which the thorough-going organization of labor was\r\ncarried. In so far as he was the independent industrial individual which\r\nthe opponents of labor unions suppose him to be, he could have no\r\nobjection to joining the union, because his individual power of\r\nefficient labor would have full opportunity of securing its reward. On\r\nthe other hand, in so far as he was unable to maintain a standard of\r\nwork commensurate with the prevailing rate of wages in any trade, he\r\nwould, of course, be excluded from its ranks. But it should be added\r\nthat in an enormous and complicated industrial body, such as that of the\r\nUnited States, a man who could not maintain the standard of work in one\r\ntrade should be able to maintain it in another and less exacting trade.\r\nThe man who could not become an efficient carpenter might do for a\r\nhod-carrier; and a man who found hod-carrying too hard on his shoulders\r\nmight be able to dig in the ground. There would be a sufficient variety\r\nof work for all kinds of industrial workers; while at the same time\r\nthere would be a systematic attempt to prevent the poorer and less\r\ncompetent laborers from competing with those of a higher grade and\r\nhindering the latter's economic amelioration. Such a result would be\r\nsuccessful only in so far as the unions were in full possession of the\r\nfield; but if the unions secure full possession even of part of the\r\nfield, the tendency will be towards an ever completer monopoly. The\r\nfewer trades into which the non-union laborers were crowded would drift\r\ninto an intolerable condition, which would make unionizing almost\r\ncompulsory.\r\n\r\nIf all, or almost all, the industrial labor of the country came to be\r\norganized in the manner proposed, the only important kind of non-union\r\nlaborer left in the country would be agricultural; and such a result\r\ncould be regarded with equanimity by an economic statesman. The existing\r\nsystem works very badly in respect to supplying the farmer with\r\nnecessary labor. In every period of prosperity the tendency is for\r\nagricultural laborers to rush off to the towns and cities for the sake\r\nof the larger wages and the less monotonous life; and when a period of\r\ndepression follows, their competition lowers the standard of living in\r\nall organized trades. If the supply of labor were regulated, and its\r\nefficiency increased as it would be under the proposed system,\r\nagricultural laborers would not have the opportunity of finding\r\nindustrial work, except of the most inferior class, until their\r\ncompetence had been proved; and it would become less fluid and unstable\r\nthan it is at present. Moreover, farm labor is, on the whole, much more\r\nwholesome for economically dependent and mechanically untrained men than\r\nlabor in towns or cities. They are more likely under such conditions to\r\nmaintain a higher moral standard. If they can be kept upon the farm\r\nuntil or unless they are prepared for a higher class of work, it will be\r\nthe greatest possible boon to American farming. Agriculture suffers in\r\nthis country peculiarly from the scarcity, the instability, and the high\r\ncost of labor; and unless it becomes more abundant, less fluid, and more\r\nefficient compared to its cost, intensive farming, as practiced in\r\nEurope, will scarcely be possible in the United States. Neither should\r\nit be forgotten that the least intelligent and trained grade of labor\r\nwould be more prosperous on the farms than in the cities, because of the\r\nlower cost of living in an agricultural region. Their scale of wages\r\nwould be determined in general by that of the lowest grade of industrial\r\nlabor, but their expenses would be materially smaller.\r\n\r\nThat the organization of labor herewith suggested would prove to be any\r\nultimate solution of the labor problem, is wholly improbable. It would\r\nconstitute, like the proposed system, of corporate regulation, at best a\r\ntransitional method of reaching some very different method of\r\nlabor-training, distribution, and compensation; and what that method\r\nmight be, is at present merely a matter of speculation. The proposed\r\nreorganization of labor, like the proposed system of institutional\r\nreform, and like the proposed constructive regulation of large\r\nindustrial corporations, simply takes advantage of those tendencies in\r\nour current methods which look in a formative direction; and in so far\r\nas these several tendencies prevail, they will severally supplement and\r\nstrengthen one another. The more independent, responsible, and vigorous\r\npolitical authority will be the readier to seek some formative solution\r\nof the problem of the distribution of wealth and that of the\r\norganization of labor. Just in so far as the combination of capital\r\ncontinues to be economically necessary, it is bound to be accompanied by\r\nthe completer unionizing of labor. Just in so far as capital continues\r\nto combine, the state is bound to appropriate the fruits of its monopoly\r\nfor public purposes. Just in so far as the corporations become the\r\nlessees of special franchises from the state, pressure can be brought to\r\nbear in favor of the more systematic and more stimulating organization\r\nof labor; and finally, just in so far as labor was systematically\r\norganized, public opinion would demand a vigorous and responsible\r\nconcentration of political and economic power, in order to maintain a\r\nproper balance. An organic unity binds the three aspects of the system\r\ntogether; and in so far as a constructive tendency becomes powerful in\r\nany one region, it will tend by its own force to introduce constructive\r\nmethods of organization into the other divisions of the economic,\r\npolitical, and social body.\r\n\r\nSuch are the outlines of a national policy which seeks to do away with\r\nexisting political and economic abuses, not by \"purification\" or\r\npurging, but by substituting for them a more positive mode of action and\r\na more edifying habit of thought. The policy seeks to make headway\r\ntowards the most far-reaching and thorough-going democratic ideals by\r\nthe taking advantage of real conditions and using realistic methods. The\r\nresult may wear to advanced social reformers the appearance of a weak\r\ncompromise. The extreme socialist democrat will find a discrepancy\r\nbetween the magnificent end and the paltry means. \"Why seek to justify,\"\r\nhe will ask, \"a series of proposals for economic and institutional\r\nreform most of which have already been tried in Europe for purely\r\npractical reasons, why seek to justify such a humble scheme of\r\nreconstruction by such a remote and lofty purpose?\" It might remind him\r\nof a New Yorker who started for the North Pole, but proposed to get\r\nthere by the Subway. The justification for the association of such a\r\nrealistic practical programme with an end which is nothing short of\r\nmoral and social improvement of mankind, is to be found, however, by the\r\nmanner in which even the foregoing proposals will be regarded by the\r\naverage American democrat. He will regard them as in meaning and effect\r\nsubversive of the established political and economic system of the\r\ncountry; and he would be right. The American people could never adopt\r\nthe accompanying programme, moderate as it is from the point of view of\r\nits ultimate object, without unsettling some of their most settled\r\nhabits and transforming many of their most cherished ideas. It would\r\nmean for the American people the gradual assumption of a new\r\nresponsibility, the adoption of a new outlook, the beginning of a new\r\nlife. It would, consequently, be radical and revolutionary in\r\nimplication, even though it were modest in its expectation of immediate\r\nachievement; and the fact that it is revolutionary in implication, but\r\nmoderate in its practical proposals, is precisely the justification for\r\nmy description of it as a constructive national programme. It is\r\nnational just because it seeks to realize the purpose of American\r\nnational association without undermining or overthrowing the living\r\nconditions of American national integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS--THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE NATIONAL PURPOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL VS. COLLECTIVE EDUCATION\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been discussing the ways in which existing American\r\neconomic and political methods and institutions should be modified in\r\norder to make towards the realization of the national democratic ideal.\r\nIn course of this discussion, it has been taken for granted that the\r\nAmerican people under competent and responsible leadership could\r\ndeliberately plan a policy of individual and social improvement, and\r\nthat with the means at their collective disposal they could make headway\r\ntowards its realization. These means consisted, of course, precisely in\r\ntheir whole outfit of political, economic, and social institutions; and\r\nthe implication has been, consequently, that human nature can be raised\r\nto a higher level by an improvement in institutions and laws. The\r\nmajority of my readers will probably have thought many times that such\r\nan assumption, whatever its truth, has been overworked. Admitting that\r\nsome institutions may be better than others, it must also be admitted\r\nthat human nature is composed of most rebellious material, and that the\r\nextent to which it can be modified by social and political institutions\r\nof any kind is, at best, extremely small. Such critics may,\r\nconsequently, have reached the conclusion that the proposed system of\r\nreconstruction, even if desirable, would not accomplish anything really\r\neffectual or decisive towards the fulfillment of the American national\r\nPromise.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true that out of the preceding chapters many sentences\r\ncould be selected which apparently imply a credulous faith in the\r\npossibility of improving human nature by law. It is also true that I\r\nhave not ventured more than to touch upon a possible institutional\r\nreformation, which, in so far as it was successful in its purpose,\r\nwould improve human nature by the most effectual of all means--that is,\r\nby improving the methods whereby men and women are bred. But if I have\r\nerred in attaching or appearing to attach too much efficacy to legal and\r\ninstitutional reforms, the error or its appearance was scarcely\r\nseparable from an analytic reconstruction of a sufficient democratic\r\nideal. Democracy must stand or fall on a platform of possible human\r\nperfectibility. If human nature cannot be improved by institutions,\r\ndemocracy is at best a more than usually safe form of political\r\norganization; and the only interesting inquiry about its future would\r\nbe: How long will it continue to work? But if it is to work better as\r\nwell as merely longer, it must have some leavening effect on human\r\nnature; and the sincere democrat is obliged to assume the power of the\r\nleaven. For him the practical questions are: How can the improvement\r\nbest be brought about? and, How much may it amount to?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Americans have always had the liveliest and\r\ncompletest faith in the process of individual and social improvement and\r\nin accepting the assumption, I am merely adhering to the deepest and\r\nmost influential of American traditions. The better American has\r\ncontinually been seeking to \"uplift\" himself, his neighbors, and his\r\ncompatriots. But he has usually favored means of improvement very\r\ndifferent from those suggested hereinbefore. The real vehicle of\r\nimprovement is education. It is by education that the American is\r\ntrained for such democracy as he possesses; and it is by better\r\neducation that he proposes to better his democracy. Men are uplifted by\r\neducation much more surely than they are by any tinkering with laws and\r\ninstitutions, because the work of education leavens the actual social\r\nsubstance. It helps to give the individual himself those qualities\r\nwithout which no institutions, however excellent, are of any use, and\r\nwith which even bad institutions and laws can be made vehicles of grace.\r\n\r\nThe American faith in education has been characterized as a\r\nsuperstition; and superstitious in some respects it unquestionably is.\r\nBut its superstitious tendency is not exhibited so much in respect to\r\nthe ordinary process of primary, secondary, and higher education. Not\r\neven an American can over-emphasize the importance of proper teaching\r\nduring youth; and the only wonder is that the money so freely lavished\r\non it does not produce better results. Americans are superstitious in\r\nrespect to education, rather because of the social \"uplift\" which they\r\nexpect to achieve by so-called educational means. The credulity of the\r\nsocialist in expecting to alter human nature by merely institutional and\r\nlegal changes is at least equaled by the credulity of the good American\r\nin proposing to evangelize the individual by the reading of books and by\r\nthe expenditure of money and words. Back of it all is the underlying\r\nassumption that the American nation by taking thought can add a cubit to\r\nits stature,--an absolute confidence in the power of the idea to create\r\nits own object and in the efficacy of good intentions.\r\n\r\nDo we lack culture? We will \"make it hum\" by founding a new university\r\nin Chicago. Is American art neglected and impoverished? We will enrich\r\nit by organizing art departments in our colleges, and popularize it by\r\nlectures with lantern slides and associations for the study of its\r\nhistory. Is New York City ugly? Perhaps, but if we could only get the\r\nauthorities to appropriate a few hundred millions for its\r\nbeautification, we could make it look like a combination of Athens,\r\nFlorence, and Paris. Is it desirable for the American citizen to be\r\nsomething of a hero? I will encourage heroes by establishing a fund\r\nwhereby they shall be rewarded in cash. War is hell, is it? I will work\r\nfor the abolition of hell by calling a convention and passing a\r\nresolution denouncing its iniquities. I will build at the Hague a Palace\r\nof Peace which shall be a standing rebuke to the War Lords of Europe.\r\nHere, in America, some of us have more money than we need and more good\r\nwill. We will spend the money in order to establish the reign of the\r\ngood, the beautiful, and the true.\r\n\r\nThis faith in a combination of good intentions, organization, words, and\r\nmoney is not confined to women's clubs or to societies of amiable\r\nenthusiasts. In the state of mind which it expresses can be detected the\r\npowerful influence which American women exert over American men; but its\r\nguiding faith and illusion are shared by the most hard-headed and\r\npractical of Americans. The very men who have made their personal\r\nsuccesses by a rigorous application of the rule that business is\r\nbusiness--the very men who in their own careers have exhibited a shrewd\r\nand vivid sense of the realities of politics and trade; it is these men\r\nwho have most faith in the practical, moral, and social power of the\r\nSubsidized Word. The most real thing which they carry over from the\r\nregion of business into the region of moral and intellectual ideals is\r\napparently their bank accounts. The fruits of their hard work and their\r\nbusiness ability are to be applied to the purpose of \"uplifting\" their\r\nfellow-countrymen. A certain number of figures written on a check and\r\nsigned by a familiar name, what may it not accomplish? Some years ago at\r\nthe opening exercises of the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburg, Mr. Andrew\r\nCarnegie burst into an impassioned and mystical vision of the\r\nmiraculously constitutive power of first mortgage steel bonds. From his\r\npoint of view and from that of the average American there is scarcely\r\nanything which the combination of abundant resources and good intentions\r\nmay not accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of seeking to cross the gulf between American practice and\r\nthe American ideal by means of education or the Subsidized Word is not\r\nbe dismissed with a sneer. The gulf cannot be crossed without the\r\nassistance of some sort of educational discipline; and that discipline\r\ndepends partly on a new exercise of the \"money power\" now safely\r\nreposing in the strong boxes of professional millionaires. There need be\r\nno fundamental objection taken to the national faith in the power of\r\ngood intentions and re-distributed wealth. That faith is the immediate\r\nand necessary issue of the logic of our national moral situation. It\r\nshould be, as it is, innocent and absolute; and if it does not remain\r\ninnocent and absolute, the Promise of American Life can scarcely be\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nA faith may, however, be innocent and absolute without being\r\ninexperienced and credulous. The American faith in education is by way\r\nof being credulous and superstitious, not because it seeks individual\r\nand social amelioration by what may be called an educational process,\r\nbut because the proposed means of education are too conscious, too\r\ndirect, and too superficial. Let it be admitted that in any one decade\r\nthe amount which can be accomplished towards individual and social\r\namelioration by means of economic and political reorganization is\r\ncomparatively small; but it is certainly as large as that which can be\r\naccomplished by subsidizing individual good intentions. Heroism is not\r\nto be encouraged by cash prizes any more than is genius; and a man's\r\nfriends should not be obliged to prove that he is a hero in order that\r\nhe may reap every appropriate reward. A hero officially conscious of his\r\nheroism is a mutilated hero. In the same way art cannot become a power\r\nin a community unless many of its members are possessed of a native and\r\ninnocent love of beautiful things; and the extent to which such a\r\npossession can be acquired by any one or two generations of\r\ntraditionally inartistic people is extremely small. Its acquisition\r\ndepends not so much upon direct conscious effort, as upon the growing\r\nability to discriminate between what is good and what is bad in their\r\nown native art. It is a matter of the training and appreciation of\r\nAmerican artists, rather than the cultivation of art. Illustrations to\r\nthe same effect might be multiplied. The popular interest in the Higher\r\nEducation has not served to make Americans attach much importance to the\r\nadvice of the highly educated man. He is less of a practical power in\r\nthe United States than he is in any European country; and this fact is\r\nin itself a sufficient commentary on the reality of the American faith\r\nin education. The fact is, of course, that the American tendency to\r\ndisbelieve in the fulfillment of their national Promise by means of\r\npolitically, economically, and socially reconstructive work has forced\r\nthem into the alternative of attaching excessive importance to\r\nsubsidized good intentions. They want to be \"uplifted,\" and they want to\r\n\"uplift\" other people; but they will not use their social and political\r\ninstitutions for the purpose, because those institutions are assumed to\r\nbe essentially satisfactory. The \"uplifting\" must be a matter of\r\nindividual, or of unofficial associated effort; and the only available\r\nmeans are words and subsidies.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a sense in which it is really true that the American\r\nnational Promise can be fulfilled only by education; and this aspect of\r\nour desirable national education can, perhaps, best be understood by\r\nseeking its analogue in the training of the individual. An individual's\r\neducation consists primarily in the discipline which he undergoes to fit\r\nhim both for fruitful association with his fellows and for his own\r\nspecial work. Important as both the liberal and the technical aspect of\r\nthis preliminary training is, it constitutes merely the beginning of a\r\nman's education. Its object is or should be to prepare him both in his\r\nwill and in his intelligence to make a thoroughly illuminating use of\r\nhis experience in life. His experience,--as a man of business, a\r\nhusband, a father, a citizen, a friend,--has been made real to him, not\r\nmerely by the zest with which he has sought it and the sincerity with\r\nwhich he has accepted it, but by the disinterested intelligence which he\r\nhas brought to its understanding. An educational discipline which has\r\ncontributed in that way to the reality of a man's experience has done as\r\nmuch for him as education can do; and an educational discipline which\r\nhas failed to make any such contribution has failed of its essential\r\npurpose. The experience of other people acquired at second hand has\r\nlittle value,--except, perhaps, as a means of livelihood,--unless it\r\nreally illuminates a man's personal experience.\r\n\r\nUsually a man's ability to profit by his own personal experience depends\r\nupon the sincerity and the intelligence which he brings to his own\r\nparticular occupation. The rule is not universal, because some men are,\r\nof course, born with much higher intellectual gifts than others; and to\r\nsuch men may be given an insight which has little foundation in any\r\ngenuine personal experience. It remains true, none the less, for the\r\ngreat majority of men, that they gather an edifying understanding of men\r\nand things just in so far as they patiently and resolutely stick to the\r\nperformance of some special and (for the most part) congenial task.\r\nTheir education in life must be grounded in the persistent attempt to\r\nrealize in action some kind of a purpose--a purpose usually connected\r\nwith the occupation whereby they live. In the pursuit of that purpose\r\nthey will be continually making experiments--opening up new lines of\r\nwork, establishing new relations with other men, and taking more or less\r\nserious risks. Each of these experiments offers them an opportunity both\r\nfor personal discipline and for increasing personal insight. If a man is\r\ncapable of becoming wise, he will gradually be able to infer from this\r\nincreasing mass of personal experience, the extent to which or the\r\nconditions under which he is capable of realizing his purpose; and his\r\ninsight into the particular realities of his own life will bring with\r\nit some kind of a general philosophy--some sort of a disposition and\r\nmethod of appraisal of men, their actions, and their surroundings.\r\nWherever a man reaches such a level of intelligence, he will be an\r\neducated man, even though his particular job has been that of a\r\nmechanic. On the other hand, a man who fails to make his particular task\r\nin life the substantial support of a genuine experience remains\r\nessentially an unenlightened man.\r\n\r\nNational education in its deeper aspect does not differ from individual\r\neducation. Its efficiency ultimately depends upon the ability of the\r\nnational consciousness to draw illuminating inferences from the course\r\nof the national experience; and its power to draw such inferences must\r\ndepend upon the persistent and disinterested sincerity with which the\r\nattempt is made to realize the national purpose--the democratic ideal of\r\nindividual and social improvement. So far as Americans are true to that\r\npurpose, all the different aspects of their national experience will\r\nassume meaning and momentum; while in so far as they are false thereto,\r\nno amount of \"education\" will ever be really edifying. The fundamental\r\nprocess of American education consists and must continue to consist\r\nprecisely in the risks and experiments which the American nation will\r\nmake in the service of its national ideal. If the American people balk\r\nat the sacrifices demanded by their experiments, or if they attach\r\nfinality to any particular experiment in the distribution of political,\r\neconomic, and social power, they will remain morally and intellectually\r\nat the bottom of a well, out of which they will never be \"uplifted\" by\r\nthe most extravagant subsidizing of good intentions and noble words.\r\n\r\nThe sort of institutional and economic reorganization suggested in the\r\npreceding chapters is not, consequently, to be conceived merely as a\r\nmore or less dubious proposal to improve human nature by laws. It is to\r\nbe conceived as (possibly) the next step in the realization of a\r\nnecessary collective purpose. Its deeper significance does not consist\r\nin the results which it may accomplish by way of immediate improvement.\r\nSuch results may be worth having; but at best they will create almost as\r\nmany difficulties as they remove. Far more important than any practical\r\nbenefits would be the indication it afforded of national good faith. It\r\nwould mean that the American nation was beginning to educate itself up\r\nto its own necessary standards. It would imply a popular realization\r\nthat our first experiment in democratic political and economic\r\norganization was founded partly on temporary conditions and partly on\r\nerroneous theories. A new experiment must consequently be made; and the\r\ngreat value of this new experiment would derive from the implied\r\nintellectual and moral emancipation. Its trial would demand both the\r\nsacrifice of many cherished interests, habits, and traditions for the\r\nsake of remaining true to a more fundamental responsibility and a much\r\nlarger infusion of disinterested motives into the economic and political\r\nsystem. Thus the sincere definite decision that the experiment was\r\nnecessary, would probably do more for American moral and social\r\namelioration than would the specific measures actually adopted and\r\ntried. Public opinion can never be brought to approve any effectual\r\nmeasures, until it is converted to a constructive and consequently to a\r\nreally educational theory of democracy.\r\n\r\nBack of the problem of educating the individual lies the problem of\r\ncollective education. On the one hand, if the nation is rendered\r\nincapable of understanding its own experience by the habit of dealing\r\ninsincerely with its national purpose, the individual, just in so far as\r\nhe himself has become highly educated, tends to be divided from his\r\ncountry and his fellow-countrymen. On the other hand, just in so far as\r\na people is sincerely seeking the fulfillment of its national Promise,\r\nindividuals of all kinds will find their most edifying individual\r\nopportunities in serving their country. In aiding the accomplishment of\r\nthe collective purpose by means of increasingly constructive\r\nexperiments, they will be increasing the scope and power of their own\r\nindividual action. The opportunities, which during the past few years\r\nthe reformers have enjoyed to make their personal lives more\r\ninteresting, would be nothing compared to the opportunities for all\r\nsorts of stirring and responsible work, which would be demanded of\r\nindividuals under the proposed plan of political and economic\r\nreorganization. The American nation would be more disinterestedly and\r\nsincerely fulfilling its collective purpose, partly because its more\r\ndistinguished individuals had been called upon to place at the service\r\nof their country a higher degree of energy, ability, and unselfish\r\ndevotion. If a nation, that is, is recreant to its deeper purpose,\r\nindividuals, so far as they are well educated, are educated away from\r\nthe prevailing national habits and traditions; whereas when a nation is\r\nsincerely attempting to meet its collective responsibility, the better\r\nindividuals are inevitably educated into active participation in the\r\ncollective task.\r\n\r\nThe reader may now be prepared to understand why the American faith in\r\neducation has the appearance of being credulous and superstitious. The\r\ngood average American usually wishes to accomplish exclusively by\r\nindividual education a result which must be partly accomplished by\r\nnational education. The nation, like the individual, must go to school;\r\nand the national school is not a lecture hall or a library. Its\r\nschooling consists chiefly in experimental collective action aimed at\r\nthe realization of the collective purpose. If the action is not aimed at\r\nthe collective purpose, a nation will learn little even from its\r\nsuccesses. If its action is aimed at the collective purpose, it may\r\nlearn much even from its mistakes. No process of merely individual\r\neducation can accomplish the work of collective education, because the\r\nnation is so much more than a group of individuals. Individuals can be\r\n\"uplifted\" without \"uplifting\" the nation, because the nation has an\r\nindividuality of its own, which cannot be increased without the\r\nconsciousness of collective responsibilities and the collective official\r\nattempt to redeem them. The processes of national and individual\r\neducation should, of course, parallel and supplement each other. The\r\nindividual can do much to aid national education by the single-minded\r\nand intelligent realization of his own specific purposes; but all\r\nindividual successes will have little more than an individual interest\r\nunless they frequently contribute to the work of national construction.\r\nThe nation can do much to aid individual education; but the best aid\r\nwithin its power is to offer to the individual a really formative and\r\ninspiring opportunity for public service. The whole round of superficial\r\neducational machinery--books, subsidies, resolutions, lectures,\r\ncongresses--may be of the highest value, provided they are used to\r\ndigest and popularize the results of a genuine individual and national\r\neducational experience, but when they are used, as so often at present,\r\nmerely as a substitute for well-purposed individual and national action,\r\nthey are precisely equivalent to an attempt to fly in a vacuum.\r\n\r\nThat the direct practical value of a reform movement may be equaled or\r\nsurpassed by its indirect educational value is a sufficiently familiar\r\nidea--an idea admirably expressed ten years ago by Mr. John Jay Chapman\r\nin the chapter on \"Education\" in his \"Causes and Consequences.\" But the\r\nidea in its familiar form is vitiated, because the educational effect of\r\nreform is usually conceived as exclusively individual. Its effect\r\n_must_, indeed, be considered wholly as an individual matter, just so\r\nlong as reform is interpreted merely as a process of purification. From\r\nthat point of view the collective purpose has already been fulfilled as\r\nfar as it can be fulfilled by collective organization, and the _only_\r\nremaining method of social amelioration is that of the self-improvement\r\nof its constituent members. As President Nicholas Murray Butler of\r\nColumbia says, in his \"True and False Democracy\": \"We must not lose\r\nsight of the fact that the corporate or collective responsibility which\r\nit (socialism) would substitute for individual initiative is only such\r\ncorporate or collective responsibility as a group of these very same\r\nindividuals could exercise. Therefore, socialism is primarily an attempt\r\nto overcome man's individual imperfections by adding them together, in\r\nthe hope that they will cancel each other.\" But what is all organization\r\nbut an attempt, not to overcome man's individual imperfections by adding\r\nthem together, so much as to make use of many men's varying individual\r\nabilities by giving each a sufficient sphere of exercise? While all men\r\nare imperfect, they are not all imperfect to the same extent. Some have\r\nmore courage, more ability, more insight, and more training than others;\r\nand an efficient organization can accomplish more than can a mere\r\ncollection of individuals, precisely because it may represent a standard\r\nof performance far above that of the average individual. Its merit is\r\nsimply that of putting the collective power of the group at the service\r\nof its ablest members; and the ablest members of the group will never\r\nattain to an individual responsibility commensurate with their powers,\r\nuntil they are enabled to work efficiently towards the redemption of the\r\ncollective responsibility. The nation gives individuality an increased\r\nscope and meaning by offering individuals a chance for effective\r\nservice, such as they could never attain under a system of collective\r\nirresponsibility. Thus under a system of collective responsibility the\r\nprocess of social improvement is absolutely identified with that of\r\nindividual improvement. The antithesis is not between nationalism and\r\nindividualism, but between an individualism which is indiscriminate, and\r\nan individualism which is selective.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF INDIVIDUAL EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nIt is, then, essential to recognize that the individual American will\r\nnever obtain a sufficiently complete chance of self-expression, until\r\nthe American nation has earnestly undertaken and measurably achieved the\r\nrealization of its collective purpose. As we shall see presently, the\r\ncure for this individual sterility lies partly with the individual\r\nhimself or rather with the man who proposes to become an individual; and\r\nunder any plan of economic or social organization, the man who proposes\r\nto become an individual is a condition of national as well as individual\r\nimprovement. It is none the less true that any success in the\r\nachievement of the national purpose will contribute positively to the\r\nliberation of the individual, both by diminishing his temptations,\r\nimproving his opportunities, and by enveloping him in an invigorating\r\nrather than an enervating moral and intellectual atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt is the economic individualism of our existing national system which\r\ninflicts the most serious damage on American individuality; and American\r\nindividual achievement in politics and science and the arts will remain\r\npartially impoverished as long as our fellow-countrymen neglect or\r\nrefuse systematically to regulate the distribution of wealth in the\r\nnational interest. I am aware, of course, that the prevailing American\r\nconviction is absolutely contradictory of the foregoing assertion.\r\nAmericans have always associated individual freedom with the unlimited\r\npopular enjoyment of all available economic opportunities. Yet it would\r\nbe far more true to say that the popular enjoyment of practically\r\nunrestricted economic opportunities is precisely the condition which\r\nmakes for individual bondage. Neither does the bondage which such a\r\nsystem fastens upon the individual exist only in the case of those\r\nindividuals who are victimized by the pressure of unlimited economic\r\ncompetition. Such victims exist, of course, in large numbers, and they\r\nwill come to exist in still larger number hereafter; but hitherto, at\r\nleast, the characteristic vice of the American system has not been the\r\nbondage imposed upon its victims. Much more insidious has been the\r\nbondage imposed upon the conquerors and their camp-followers. A man's\r\nindividuality is as much compromised by success under the conditions\r\nimposed by such a system as it is by failure. His actual occupation may\r\ntend to make his individuality real and fruitful; but the quality of the\r\nwork is determined by a merely acquisitive motive, and the man himself\r\nthereby usually debarred from obtaining any edifying personal\r\nindependence or any peculiar personal distinction. Different as American\r\nbusiness men are one from another in temperament, circumstances, and\r\nhabits, they have a way of becoming fundamentally very much alike. Their\r\nindividualities are forced into a common mold, because the ultimate\r\nmeasure of the value of their work is the same, and is nothing but its\r\nresults in cash.\r\n\r\nConsider for a moment what individuality and individual independence\r\nreally mean. A genuine individual must at least possess some special\r\nquality which distinguishes him from other people, which unifies the\r\nsuccessive phases and the various aspects of his own life and which\r\nresults in personal moral freedom. In what way and to what extent does\r\nthe existing economic system contribute to the creation of such genuine\r\nindividuals? At its best it asks of every man who engages in a business\r\noccupation that he make as much money as he can, and the only conditions\r\nit imposes on this pursuit of money are those contained in the law of\r\nthe land and a certain conventional moral code. The pursuit of money is\r\nto arouse a man to individual activity, and law and custom determine the\r\nconditions to which the activity must conform. The man does not become\r\nan individual merely by obeying the written and unwritten laws. He\r\nbecomes an individual because the desire to make money releases his\r\nenergy and intensifies his personal initiative. The kind of individuals\r\ncreated by such an economic system are not distinguished one from\r\nanother by any special purpose. They are distinguished by the energy and\r\nsuccess whereby the common purpose of making money is accompanied and\r\nfollowed. Some men show more enterprise and ingenuity in devising ways\r\nof making money than others, or they show more vigor and zeal in taking\r\nadvantage of the ordinary methods. These men are the kind of individuals\r\nwhich the existing economic system tends to encourage; and critics of\r\nthe existing system are denounced, because of the disastrous effect upon\r\nindividual initiative which would result from restricting individual\r\neconomic freedom.\r\n\r\nBut why should a man become an individual because he does what everybody\r\nelse does, only with more energy and success? The individuality so\r\nacquired is merely that of one particle in a mass of similar particles.\r\nSome particles are bigger than others and livelier; but from a\r\nsufficient distance they all look alike; and in substance and meaning\r\nthey all are alike. Their individual activity and history do not make\r\nthem less alike. It merely makes them bigger or smaller, livelier or\r\nmore inert. Their distinction from their fellows is quantitative; the\r\nunity of their various phases a matter of repetition; their independence\r\nwholly comparative. Such men are associated with their fellows in the\r\npursuit of a common purpose, and they are divided from their fellows by\r\nthe energy and success with which that purpose is pursued. On the other\r\nhand, a condition favorable to genuine individuality would be one in\r\nwhich men were divided from one another by special purposes, and\r\nreunited in so far as these individual purposes were excellently and\r\nsuccessfully achieved.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that individuality cannot be dissociated from the pursuit\r\nof a disinterested object. It is a moral and intellectual quality, and\r\nit must be realized by moral and intellectual means. A man achieves\r\nindividual distinction, not by the enterprise and vigor with which he\r\naccumulates money, but by the zeal and the skill with which he pursues\r\nan exclusive interest--an interest usually, but not necessarily,\r\nconnected with his means of livelihood. The purpose to which he is\r\ndevoted--such, for instance, as that of painting or of running a\r\nrailroad--is not exclusive in the sense of being unique. But it becomes\r\nexclusive for the individual who adopts it, because of the single-minded\r\nand disinterested manner in which it is pursued. A man makes the purpose\r\nexclusive for himself by the spirit and method in which the work is\r\ndone; and just in proportion as the work is thoroughly well done, a\r\nman's individuality begins to take substance and form. His individual\r\nquality does not depend merely on the display of superior enterprise\r\nand energy, although, of course, he may and should be as enterprising\r\nand as energetic as he can. It depends upon the actual excellence of the\r\nwork in every respect,--an excellence which can best be achieved by the\r\nabsorbing and exclusive pursuit of that alone. A man's individuality is\r\nprojected into his work. He does not stop when he has earned enough\r\nmoney, and he does not cease his improvements when they cease to bring\r\nin an immediate return. He is identified with his job, and by means of\r\nthat identification his individuality becomes constructive. His\r\nachievement, just because of its excellence, has an inevitable and an\r\nunequivocal social value. The quality of a man's work reunites him with\r\nhis fellows. He may have been in appearance just as selfish as a man who\r\nspends most of his time in making money, but if his work has been\r\nthoroughly well done, he will, in making himself an individual, have\r\nmade an essential contribution to national fulfillment.\r\n\r\nOf course, a great deal of very excellent work is accomplished under the\r\nexisting economic system; and by means of such work many a man becomes\r\nmore or less of an individual. But in so far as such is the case, it is\r\nthe work which individualizes and not the unrestricted competitive\r\npursuit of money. In so far as the economic motive prevails,\r\nindividuality is not developed; it is stifled. The man whose motive is\r\nthat of money-making will not make the work any more excellent than is\r\ndemanded by the largest possible returns; and frequently the largest\r\npossible returns are to be obtained by indifferent work or by work which\r\nhas absolutely no social value. The ordinary mercenary purpose always\r\ncompels a man to stop at a certain point, and consider something else\r\nthan the excellence of his achievement. It does not make the individual\r\nindependent, except in so far as independence is merely a matter of cash\r\nin the bank; and for every individual on whom it bestows excessive\r\npecuniary independence, there are many more who are by that very\r\ncircumstance denied any sort of liberation. Even pecuniary independence\r\nis usually purchased at the price of moral and intellectual bondage.\r\nSuch genuine individuality as can be detected in the existing social\r\nsystem is achieved not because of the prevailing money-making motive,\r\nbut in spite thereof.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary answer to such criticisms is that while the existing\r\nsystem may have many faults, it certainly has proved an efficient means\r\nof releasing individual energy; whereas the exercise of a positive\r\nnational responsibility for the wholesome distribution of wealth would\r\ntend to deprive the individual of any sufficient initiative. The claim\r\nis that the money-making motive is the only one which will really arouse\r\nthe great majority of men, and to weaken it would be to rob the whole\r\neconomic system of its momentum. Just what validity this claim may have\r\ncannot, with our present experience, be definitely settled. That to\r\ndeprive individuals suddenly of the opportunities they have so long\r\nenjoyed would be disastrous may be fully admitted. It may also be\r\nadmitted that any immediate and drastic attempt to substitute for the\r\npresent system a national regulation of the distribution of wealth or a\r\nnational responsibility for the management even of monopolies or\r\nsemi-monopolies would break down and would do little to promote either\r\nindividual or social welfare. But to conclude from any such admissions\r\nthat a systematic policy of promoting individual and national\r\namelioration should be abandoned in wholly unnecessary. That the\r\nexisting system has certain practical advantages, and is a fair\r\nexpression of the average moral standards of to-day is not only its\r\nchief merit, but also its chief and inexcusable defect. What a\r\ndemocratic nation must do is not to accept human nature as it is, but to\r\nmove in the direction of its improvement. The question it must answer\r\nis: How can it contribute to the increase of American individuality? The\r\ndefender of the existing system must be able to show either (1) that it\r\ndoes contribute to the increase of American individuality; or that (2)\r\nwhatever its limitations, the substitution of some better system is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nOf course, a great many defenders of the existing system will\r\nunequivocally declare that it does contribute effectually to the\r\nincrease of individuality, and it is this defense which is most\r\ndangerous, because it is due, not to any candid consideration of the\r\nfacts, but to unreasoning popular prejudice and personal\r\nself-justification. The existing system contributes to the increase of\r\nindividuality only in case individuality is deprived of all serious\r\nmoral and intellectual meaning. In order to sustain their assertion they\r\nmust define individuality, not as a living ideal, but as the\r\npsychological condition produced by any individual action. In the light\r\nof such a definition every action performed by an individual would\r\ncontribute to individuality; and, conversely, every action performed by\r\nthe state, which conceivably could be left to individuals, would\r\ndiminish individuality. Such a conception derives from the early\r\nnineteenth century principles of an essential opposition between the\r\nstate and the individual; and it is a deduction from the common\r\nconception of democracy as nothing but a finished political organization\r\nin which the popular will prevails. As applied in the traditional\r\nAmerican system this conception of individuality has resulted in the\r\ndifferentiation of an abundance of raw individual material, but the raw\r\nmaterial has been systematically encouraged to persist only on condition\r\nthat it remained undeveloped. Properly speaking, it has not encouraged\r\nindividualism at all. Individuality is necessarily based on genuine\r\ndiscrimination. It has encouraged particularism. While the particles\r\nhave been roused into activity, they all remain dominated by\r\nsubstantially the same forces of attraction and repulsion. But in order\r\nthat one of the particles may fulfill the promise of a really separate\r\nexistence, he must pursue some special interest of his own. In that way\r\nhe begins to realize his individuality, and in realizing his\r\nindividuality he is coming to occupy a special niche in the national\r\nstructure. A national structure which encourages individuality as\r\nopposed to mere particularity is one which creates innumerable special\r\nniches, adapted to all degrees and kinds of individual development. The\r\nindividual becomes a nation in miniature, but devoted to the loyal\r\nrealization of a purpose peculiar to himself. The nation becomes an\r\nenlarged individual whose special purpose is that of human amelioration,\r\nand in whose life every individual should find some particular but\r\nessential function.\r\n\r\nIt surely cannot be seriously claimed that the improvement of the\r\nexisting economic organization for the sake of contributing to the\r\nincrease of such genuine individuals is impossible. If genuine\r\nindividuality depends upon the pursuit of an exclusive interest,\r\npromoted most certainly and completely by a disinterested motive, it\r\nmust be encouraged by enabling men so far as possible to work from\r\ndisinterested motives. Doubtless this is a difficult, but it is not an\r\nimpossible task. It cannot be completely achieved until the whole basis\r\nof economic competition is changed. At present men compete chiefly for\r\nthe purpose of securing the most money to spend or to accumulate. They\r\nmust in the end compete chiefly for the purpose of excelling in the\r\nquality of their work that of other men engaged in a similar occupation.\r\nAnd there are assuredly certain ways in which the state can diminish the\r\nundesirable competition and encourage the desirable competition.\r\n\r\nThe several economic reforms suggested in the preceding chapter would,\r\nso far as they could be successfully introduced, promote more\r\ndisinterested economic work. These reforms would not, of course,\r\nentirely do away with the influence of selfish acquisitive motives in\r\nthe economic field, because such motives must remain powerful as long as\r\nprivate property continues to have a public economic function. But they\r\nwould at least diminish the number of cases in which the influence of\r\nthe mercenary motive made against rather than for excellence of work.\r\nThe system which most encourages mere cupidity is one which affords too\r\nmany opportunities for making \"easy money,\" and our American system has,\r\nof course, been peculiarly prolific of such opportunities. As long as\r\nindividuals are allowed to accumulate money from mines, urban real\r\nestate, municipal franchises, or semi-monopolies of any kind, just to\r\nthat extent will the economic system of the country be poisoned, and its\r\ngeneral efficiency impaired. Men will inevitably seek to make money in\r\nthe easiest possible way, and as long as such easy ways exist fewer\r\nindividuals will accept cordially the necessity of earning their living\r\nby the sheer excellence of achievement. On the other hand, in case such\r\nopportunities of making money without earning it can be eliminated,\r\nthere will be a much closer correspondence than there is at present\r\nbetween the excellence of the work and the reward it would bring. Such a\r\ncorrespondence would, of course, be far from exact. In all petty kinds\r\nof business innumerable opportunities would still exist of earning more\r\nmoney either by disregarding the quality of the work or sometimes by\r\nactually lowering it. But at any rate it would be work which would earn\r\nmoney, and not speculation or assiduous repose in an easy chair.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, just in so far as industry became organized under\r\nnational control for the public benefit, there would be a much closer\r\ncorrespondence between the quality of the work and the amount of the\r\nreward. In a well-managed corporation a man is promoted because he does\r\ngood work, and has shown himself capable of assuming larger\r\nresponsibilities and exercising more power. His promotion brings with it\r\na larger salary, and the chance of obtaining a larger salary doubtless\r\nhas much to do with the excellence of the work; but at all events a man\r\nis not rewarded for doing bad work or for doing no work at all. The\r\nsuccessful employee of a corporation has not become disinterested in his\r\nmotives. Presumably he will not do any more work than will contribute to\r\nhis personal advancement; and if the standard of achievement in his\r\noffice is at all relaxed, he will not be kept up to the mark by an\r\nexclusive and disinterested devotion to the work itself. Still, under\r\nsuch conditions a man might well become better than his own motives.\r\nWhenever the work itself was really interesting, he might become\r\nabsorbed in it by the very momentum of his habitual occupation, and this\r\nwould be particularly the case provided his work assumed a technical\r\ncharacter. In that case he would have to live up to the standard, not\r\nmerely of an office, but of a trade, a profession, a craft, an art, or a\r\nscience; and if those technical standards were properly exacting, he\r\nwould be kept up to the level of his best work by a motive which had\r\nalmost become disinterested. He could not fall below the standard, even\r\nthough he derived no personal profit from striving to live up to it,\r\nbecause the traditions and the honor of his craft would not let him.\r\n\r\nThe proposed economic policy of reform, in so far as it were successful,\r\nwould also tend to stimulate labor to more efficiency, and to diminish\r\nits grievances. The state would be lending assistance to the effort of\r\nthe workingman to raise his standard of living, and to restrict the\r\ndemoralizing effect of competition among laborers who cannot afford to\r\nmake a stand on behalf of their own interest. It should, consequently,\r\nincrease the amount of economic independence enjoyed by the average\r\nlaborer, diminish his \"class consciousness\" by doing away with his class\r\ngrievances, and intensify his importance to himself as an individual. It\r\nwould in every way help to make the individual workingman more of an\r\nindividual. His class interest would be promoted by the nation in so\r\nfar as such promotion was possible, and could be adjusted to a general\r\npolicy of national economic construction. His individual interest would\r\nbe left in his own charge; but he would have much more favorable\r\nopportunities of redeeming the charge by the excellence of his\r\nindividual work than he has under the existing system. His condition\r\nwould doubtless still remain in certain respects unsatisfactory, for the\r\npurpose of a democratic nation must remain unfulfilled just in so far as\r\nthe national organization of labor does not enable all men to compete on\r\napproximately equal terms for all careers. But a substantial step would\r\nbe made towards its improvement, and the road marked, perhaps, for still\r\nfurther advance.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, must the reader be warned that the important thing is\r\nthe constructive purpose, and not the means proposed for its\r\nrealization. Whenever the attempt at its realization is made, it is\r\nprobable that other and unforeseen measures will be found necessary; and\r\neven if a specific policy proposed were successfully tried, this would\r\nconstitute merely an advance towards the ultimate end. The ultimate end\r\nis the complete emancipation of the individual, and that result depends\r\nupon his complete disinterestedness. He must become interested\r\nexclusively in the excellence of his work; and he can never become\r\ndisinterestedly interested in his work as long as heavy responsibilities\r\nand high achievements are supposed to be rewarded by increased pay. The\r\neffort equitably to adjust compensation to earnings is ultimately not\r\nonly impossible, but undesirable, because it necessarily would foul the\r\nwhole economic organization--so far as its efficiency depended on a\r\ngenerous rivalry among individuals. The only way in which work can be\r\nmade entirely disinterested is to adjust its compensation to the needs\r\nof a normal and wholesome human life.\r\n\r\nAny substantial progress towards the attainment of complete individual\r\ndisinterestedness is far beyond the reach of contemporary collective\r\neffort, but such disinterestedness should be clearly recognized as the\r\neconomic condition both of the highest fulfillment which democracy can\r\nbestow upon the individual and of a thoroughly wholesome democratic\r\norganization. Says Mr. John Jay Chapman in the chapter on \"Democracy,\"\r\nin his \"Causes and Consequences\": \"It is thought that the peculiar merit\r\nof democracy lies in this: that it gives every man a chance to pursue\r\nhis own ends. The reverse is true. The merit lies in the assumption\r\nimposed upon every man that he shall serve his fellow-men.... The\r\nconcentration of every man on his own interests has been the danger and\r\nnot the safety of democracy, for democracy contemplates that every man\r\nshall think first of the state and next of himself.... Democracy assumes\r\nperfection in human nature.\" But men will always continue chiefly to\r\npursue their own private ends as long as those ends are recognized by\r\nthe official national ideal as worthy of perpetuation and encouragement.\r\nIf it be true that democracy is based upon the assumption that every man\r\nshall serve his fellow-men, the organization of democracy should be\r\ngradually adapted to that assumption. The majority of men cannot be made\r\ndisinterested for life by exhortation, by religious services, by any\r\nexpenditure of subsidized words, or even by a grave and manifest public\r\nneed. They can be made permanently unselfish only by being helped to\r\nbecome disinterested in their individual purposes, and how can they be\r\ndisinterested except in a few little spots as long as their daily\r\noccupation consists of money seeking and spending in conformity with a\r\nfew written and unwritten rules? In the complete democracy a man must in\r\nsome way be made to serve the nation in the very act of contributing to\r\nhis own individual fulfillment. Not until his personal action is\r\ndictated by disinterested motives can there be any such harmony between\r\nprivate and public interests. To ask an individual citizen continually\r\nto sacrifice his recognized private interest to the welfare of his\r\ncountrymen is to make an impossible demand, and yet just such a\r\ncontinual sacrifice is apparently required of an individual in a\r\ndemocratic state. The only entirely satisfactory solution of the\r\ndifficulty is offered by the systematic authoritative transformation of\r\nthe private interest of the individual into a disinterested devotion to\r\na special object.\r\n\r\nAmerican public opinion has not as yet begun to understand the relation\r\nbetween the process of national education by means of a patient attempt\r\nto realize the national purpose and the corresponding process of\r\nindividual emancipation and growth. It still believes that democracy is\r\na happy device for evading collective responsibilities by passing them\r\non to the individual; and as long as this belief continues to prevail,\r\nthe first necessity of American educational advance is the arousing of\r\nthe American intellectual conscience. Behind the tradition of national\r\nirresponsibility is the still deeper tradition of intellectual\r\ninsincerity in political matters. Americans are almost as much afraid of\r\nconsistent and radical political thinking as are the English, and with\r\nnothing like as much justification. Jefferson offered them a seductive\r\nexample of triumphant intellectual dishonesty, and of the sacrifice of\r\ntheory to practice, whenever such a sacrifice was convenient.\r\nJefferson's example has been warmly approved by many subsequent\r\nintellectual leaders. Before Emerson and after, mere consistency has\r\nbeen stigmatized as the preoccupation of petty minds; and our American\r\nsuperiority to the necessity of making ideas square with practice, or\r\none idea with another, has been considered as an exhibition of\r\nremarkable political common sense. The light-headed Frenchmen really\r\nbelieved in their ideas, and fell thereby into a shocking abyss of\r\nanarchy and fratricidal bloodshed, whereas we have avoided any similar\r\nfate by preaching a \"noble national theory\" and then practicing it just\r\nas far as it suited our interests or was not too costly in time and\r\nmoney. No doubt, we also have had our domestic difficulties, and were\r\nobliged to shed a good deal of American blood, because we resolutely\r\nrefused to believe that human servitude was not entirely compatible with\r\nthe loftiest type of democracy; but then, the Civil War might have been\r\navoided if the Abolitionists had not erroneously insisted on being\r\nconsistent. The way to escape similar trouble in the future is to go on\r\npreaching ideality, and to leave its realization wholly to the\r\nindividual. We can then be \"uplifted\" by the words, while the resulting\r\ndeeds cannot do us, as individuals, any harm. We can continue to\r\ncelebrate our \"noble national theory\" and preserve our perfect\r\ndemocratic system until the end of time without making any of the\r\nindividual sacrifices or taking any of the collective risks, inseparable\r\nfrom a systematic attempt to make our words good.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing state of mind is the great obstacle to the American\r\nnational advance; and its exposure and uprooting is the primary need of\r\nAmerican education. In agitating against the traditional disregard of\r\nour full national responsibility, a critic will do well to dispense with\r\nthe caution proper to the consideration of specific practical problems.\r\nA radical theory does not demand in the interest of consistency an\r\nequally radical action. It only demands a sincere attempt to push the\r\napplication of the theory as far as conditions will permit, and the\r\nemployment of means sufficient probably to accomplish the immediate\r\npurpose. But in the endeavor to establish and popularize his theory, a\r\nradical critic cannot afford any similar concessions. His own opinions\r\ncan become established only by the displacement of the traditional\r\nopinions; and the way to displace a traditional error is not to be\r\ncompromising and conciliatory, but to be as uncompromising and as\r\nirritating as one's abilities and one's vision of the truth will permit.\r\nThe critic in his capacity as agitator is living in a state of war with\r\nhis opponents; and the ethics of warfare are not the ethics of\r\nstatesmanship. Public opinion can be reconciled to a constructive\r\nnational programme only by the agitation of what is from the traditional\r\nstandpoint a body of revolutionary ideas.\r\n\r\nIn vigorously agitating such a body of revolutionary ideas, the critic\r\nwould be doing more than performing a desirable public service. He would\r\nbe vindicating his own individual intellectual interest. The integrity\r\nand energy of American intellectual life has been impaired for\r\ngenerations by the tradition of national irresponsibility. Such\r\nirresponsibility necessarily implies a sacrifice of individual\r\nintellectual and moral interests to individual and popular economic\r\ninterests. It could not persist except by virtue of intellectual and\r\nmoral conformity. The American intellectual habit has on the whole been\r\njust about as vigorous and independent as that of the domestic animals.\r\nThe freedom of opinion of which we boast has consisted for the most part\r\nin uttering acceptable commonplaces with as much defiant conviction as\r\nif we were uttering the most daring and sublimest heresies. In making\r\nthis parade of the uniform of intellectual independence, the American is\r\nnot consciously insincere. He is prepared to do battle for his\r\nconvictions, but his really fundamental convictions he shares with\r\neverybody else. His differences with his fellow-countrymen are those of\r\ninterest and detail. When he breaks into a vehement proclamation of his\r\nfaith, he is much like a bull, who has broken out of his stall, and goes\r\nsnorting around the barnyard, tossing everybody within reach of his\r\nhorns. A bull so employed might well consider that he was offering the\r\nworld a fine display of aggressive individuality, whereas he had in\r\ntruth been behaving after the manner of all bulls from the dawn of\r\ndomestication. No doubt he is quite capable of being a dangerous\r\ncustomer, in case he can reach anybody with his horns; but on the other\r\nhand how meekly can he be led back into the stall by the simple device\r\nof attaching a ring to his nose. His individuality always has a tender\r\nspot, situated in much the same neighborhood as his personal economic\r\ninterests. If this tender spot is merely irritated, it will make him\r\nrage; but when seized with a firm grip he loses all his defiance and\r\nbecomes as aggressive an individual as a good milch cow.\r\n\r\nThe American intellectual interest demands, consequently, a different\r\nsort of assertion from the American economic or political interest.\r\nEconomically and politically the need is for constructive regulation,\r\nimplying the imposition of certain fruitful limitations upon traditional\r\nindividual freedom. But the national intellectual development demands\r\nabove all individual emancipation. American intelligence has still to\r\nissue its Declaration of Independence. It has still to proclaim that in\r\na democratic system the intelligence has a discipline, an interest, and\r\na will of its own, and that this special discipline and interest call\r\nfor a new conception both of individual and of national development. For\r\nthe time being the freedom which Americans need is the freedom of\r\nthought. The energy they need is the energy of thought. The moral unity\r\nthey need cannot be obtained without intensity and integrity of thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS AT INDIVIDUAL EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nAmericans believe, of course, that they enjoy perfect freedom of\r\nopinion, and so they do in form. There is no legal encouragement of any\r\none set of opinions. There is no legal discouragement of another set of\r\nopinions. They have denied intellectual freedom to themselves by\r\nmethods very much more insidious than those employed by a despotic\r\ngovernment. A national tradition has been established which prevents\r\nindividuals from desiring freedom; and if they should desire and obtain\r\nit, they are prevented from using it. The freedom of American speech and\r\nthought has not been essentially different from the freedom of speech\r\nwhich a group of prisoners might enjoy during the term of their\r\nimprisonment. The prisoners could, of course, think and talk much as\r\nthey pleased, but there was nobody but themselves to hear; and in the\r\nabsence both of an adequate material, discipline, and audience, both the\r\nwords and thoughts were without avail. The truth is, of course, that\r\nintellectual individuality and independence were sacrificed for the\r\nbenefit of social homogeneity and the quickest possible development of\r\nAmerican economic opportunities; and in this way a vital relation has\r\nbeen established for Americans between the assertion of intellectual\r\nindependence or moral individuality and the adoption of a nationalized\r\neconomic and political system.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Period American individual intelligence did, indeed,\r\nstruggle gallantly to attain freedom. The intellectual ferment at that\r\ntime was more active and more general than it is to-day. During the\r\nthree decades before the war, a remarkable outbreak of heresy occurred\r\nall over the East and middle West. Every convention of American life was\r\nquestioned, except those unconscious conventions of feeling and thought\r\nwhich pervaded the intellectual and moral atmosphere. The Abolitionist\r\nagitation was the one practical political result of this ferment, but\r\nmany of these free-thinkers wished to emancipate the whites as well as\r\nthe blacks. They fearlessly challenged substantially all the established\r\ninstitutions of society. The institutions of marriage and the state\r\nfared frequently as ill as did property and the church. Radical,\r\nhowever, as they were in thought, they were by no means revolutionary in\r\naction. The several brands of heresy differed too completely one from\r\nanother to be melted into a single political agitation and programme.\r\nThe need for action spent itself in the formation of socialistic\r\ncommunities of the most varied kind, the great majority of which were\r\nsoon either disbanded or transformed. But whatever its limitations the\r\nferment was symptomatic of a genuine revolt of the American spirit\r\nagainst the oppressive servitude of the individual intelligence to the\r\nsocial will, demanded by the popular democratic system and tradition.\r\n\r\nThe revolt, however, with all the sincere enthusiasm it inspired, was\r\ncondemned to sterility. It accomplished nothing and could accomplish\r\nnothing for society, because it sought by individual or unofficial\r\nassociated action results which demanded official collective action; and\r\nit accomplished little even for the individual, because it was not the\r\noutcome of any fruitful individual discipline. The emancipated idea was\r\nusually defined by seeking the opposite of the conventional idea.\r\nIndividuality was considered to be a matter of being somehow and anyhow\r\ndifferent from other people. There was no authentic intellectual\r\ndiscipline behind the agitation. The pioneer democrat with all his\r\nlimitations embodied the only living national body of opinion, and he\r\nremained untainted by this outburst of heresy. He deprived it of all\r\nvitality by depriving its separate explosions, Abolitionism excepted, of\r\nall serious attention. He crushed it far more effectually by\r\nindifference than he would have by persecution. When the shock of the\r\nCivil War aroused Americans to a realization of the unpleasant political\r\nrealities sometimes associated with the neglect of a \"noble national\r\ntheory,\" the ferment subsided without leaving behind so much as a loaf\r\nof good white bread.\r\n\r\nFor practical political purposes it exhausted itself, as I have said, in\r\nAbolitionism, and in that movement both its strength and weakness are\r\nwrit plain. Its revolt on behalf of emancipation was courageous and\r\nsincere. The patriotism which inspired it recognized the need of\r\njustifying its protestantism by a better conception of democracy. But\r\nthe heresy was as incoherent and as credulous as the antithetic\r\northodoxy. It sought to accomplish an intellectual revolution without\r\norganizing either an army or an armament--just as the pioneer democrat\r\nexpected to convert untutored enthusiasm into acceptable technical work,\r\nand a popular political and economic atomism into a substantially\r\nsocialized community. In its meaning and effect, consequently, the\r\nrevolt was merely negative and anti-national. It served a constructive\r\ndemocratic purpose only by the expensive and dubious means of\r\ninstigating a Civil War. If any of the other heresies of the period, as\r\nwell as Abolitionism, had developed into an effective popular agitation,\r\nthey could have obtained a similar success only by means of incurring a\r\nsimilar danger. The intellectual ideals of the movement were not\r\neducational, and its declaration of intellectual independence issued in\r\nas sterile a programme for the Republic of American thought as did the\r\nDeclaration of Political Independence for the American national\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nIn truth all these mid-century American heretics were not heretics at\r\nall in relation to really stupefying and perverting American tradition.\r\nThey were sturdily rebellious against all manner of respectable methods,\r\nideas, and institutions, but none of them dreamed of protesting against\r\nthe real enemy of American intellectual independence. They never dreamed\r\nof associating the moral and intellectual emancipation of the individual\r\nwith the conscious fulfillment of the American national purpose and with\r\nthe patient and open-eyed individual and social discipline thereby\r\ndemanded. They all shared the illusion of the pioneers that somehow a\r\nspecial Providential design was effective on behalf of the American\r\npeople, which permitted them as individuals and as a society to achieve\r\ntheir purposes by virtue of good intentions, exuberant enthusiasm, and\r\nenlightened selfishness. The New World and the new American idea had\r\nreleased them from the bonds in which less fortunate Europeans were\r\nentangled. Those bonds were not to be considered as the terms under\r\nwhich excellent individual and social purposes were necessarily to be\r\nachieved. They were bad habits, which the dead past had imposed upon the\r\ninhabitants of the Old World, and from which Americans could be\r\nemancipated by virtue of their abundant faith in human nature and the\r\nboundless natural opportunities of the new continent.\r\n\r\nThus the American national ideal of the Middle Period was essentially\r\ngeographical. The popular thinkers of that day were hypnotized by the\r\nreiterated suggestion of a new American world. Their fellow-countrymen\r\nhad obtained and were apparently making good use of a wholly\r\nunprecedented amount of political and economic freedom; and they jumped\r\nto the conclusion that the different disciplinary methods which limited\r\nboth individual and social action in Europe were unnecessary. Just as\r\nthe Jacksonian Democracy had finally vindicated American political\r\nindependence by doing away with the remnants of our earlier political\r\ncolonialism, so American moral and intellectual independence demanded a\r\nsimilar vindication. This geographical protestantism was in a measure\r\nprovoked, if not justified, by the habit of colonial dependence upon\r\nEurope in matters of opinion, which so many well-educated Americans of\r\nthat period continued to cherish. But it was based upon the illusion\r\nthat the economic and social conditions of the Middle Period, which\r\nfavored temporarily a mixture of faith and irresponsibility, freedom and\r\nformlessness, would persist and could be translated into terms of\r\nindividual intellectual and moral discipline. In truth, it was, of\r\ncourse, a great mistake to conceive Americanism as intellectually and\r\nmorally a species of Newer-Worldliness. A national intellectual ideal\r\ndid not divide us from Europe any more than did a national political\r\nideal. In both cases national independence had no meaning except in a\r\nsystem of international, intellectual, moral, and political relations.\r\nAmerican national independence was to be won, not by means of a perverse\r\nopposition to European intellectual and moral influence, but by a\r\npositive and a thorough-going devotion to our own national democratic\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nThe national intellectual ideal could afford to be as indifferent to the\r\nsources of American intellectual life as the American political ideal\r\nwas to the sources of American citizenship. The important thing was and\r\nis, not where our citizens or our special disciplinary ideals come from,\r\nbut what use we make of them. Just as economic and political Americanism\r\nhas been broad enough and vital enough to make a place in the American\r\nsocial economy for the hordes of European immigrants with their many\r\ndiverse national characteristics, so the intellectual basis of\r\nAmericanism must be broad enough to include and vigorous enough to\r\nassimilate the special ideals and means of discipline necessary to every\r\nkind of intellectual or moral excellence. The technical ideals and\r\nstandards which the typical American of the Middle Period instinctively\r\nunder-valued are neither American nor European. They are merely the\r\nspecial forms whereby the several kinds of intellectual eminence are to\r\nbe obtained. They belong to the nature of the craft. Those forms and\r\nstandards were never sufficiently naturalized in America during the\r\nColonial Period, because the economic and social conditions of the time\r\ndid not justify such naturalization. The appropriate occasion for the\r\ntransfer was postponed until after American political independence had\r\nbeen secured; and when occasion did not arise, the naturalness of the\r\ntransfer was perverted and obscured by political preconceptions.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations throw a new light upon the mistake made by\r\nthe American heretics of the Middle Period. In so far as their assertion\r\nof American intellectual independence was negative, it should not have\r\nbeen a protest against \"feudalism,\" social classification, social and\r\nindividual discipline, approved technical methods, or any of those\r\nsocial forms and intellectual standards which so many Americans vaguely\r\nbelieved to be exclusively European. It should have been a protest\r\nagainst a sterile and demoralizing Americanism--the Americanism of\r\nnational irresponsibility and indiscriminate individualism. The bondage\r\nfrom which Americans needed, and still need, emancipation is not from\r\nEurope, but from the evasions, the incoherence, the impatience, and the\r\neasy-going conformity of their own intellectual and moral traditions. We\r\ndo not have to cross the Atlantic in order to hunt for the enemies of\r\nAmerican national independence and fulfillment. They sit at our\r\npolitical fireside and toast their feet on its coals. They poison\r\nAmerican patriotic feeling until it becomes, not a leaven, but a kind of\r\nnational gelatine. They enshrine this American democratic ideal in a\r\ntemple of canting words which serves merely as a cover for a religion of\r\npersonal profit. American moral and intellectual emancipation can be\r\nachieved only by a victory over the ideas, the conditions, and the\r\nstandards which make Americanism tantamount to collective\r\nirresponsibility and to the moral and intellectual subordination of the\r\nindividual to a commonplace popular average.\r\n\r\nThe heretics of the Middle Period were not cowardly, but they were\r\nintellectually irresponsible, undisciplined, and inexperienced. Sharing,\r\nas they did, most of the deeper illusions of their time, they did not\r\nvindicate their own individual intellectual independence, and they\r\ncontributed little or nothing to American national intellectual\r\nindependence. With the exception of a few of the men of letters who had\r\ninherited a formative local tradition, their own personal careers were\r\nexamples not of gradual individual fulfillment, but at best of\r\nrepetition and at worst of degeneracy. Like the most brilliant\r\ncontemporary Whig politicians, such as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster,\r\ntheir intellectual individuality was gradually cheapened by the manner\r\nin which it was expressed; and it is this fact which makes the case of\r\nLincoln, both as a politician and a thinker, so unique and so\r\nextraordinary. The one public man of this period who did impose upon\r\nhimself a patient and a severe intellectual and moral discipline, who\r\nreally did seek the excellent use of his own proper tools, is the man\r\nwho preëminently attained national intellectual and moral stature. The\r\ndifference in social value between Lincoln and, say, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison can be measured by the difference in moral and intellectual\r\ndiscipline to which each of these men submitted. Lincoln sedulously\r\nturned to account every intellectual and moral opportunity which his\r\nlife afforded. Garrison's impatient temper and unbalanced mind made him\r\nthe enthusiastic advocate of a few distorted and limited ideas. The\r\nconsequence was that Garrison, although apparently an arch-heretic, was\r\nin reality the victim of the sterile American convention which makes\r\nwillful enthusiasm, energy, and good intentions a sufficient substitute\r\nfor necessary individual and collective training. Lincoln, on the other\r\nhand, was in his whole moral and intellectual make-up a living protest\r\nagainst the aggressive, irresponsible, and merely practical Americanism\r\nof his day; while at the same time in the greatness of his love and\r\nunderstanding he never allowed his distinction to divide him from his\r\nfellow-countrymen. His was the unconscious and constructive heresy which\r\nlooked in the direction of national intellectual independence and\r\nnational moral union and good faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMEANS OF INDIVIDUAL EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to define more clearly just how the American\r\nindividual can assert his independence, and how in asserting his\r\nindependence he can contribute to American national fulfillment. He\r\ncannot make any effective advance towards national fulfillment merely by\r\neducating himself and his fellow-countrymen as individuals to a higher\r\nintellectual and moral level, because an essential condition of really\r\nedifying individual education is the gradual process of collective\r\neducation by means of collective action and formative collective\r\ndiscipline. On the other hand, this task of collective education is far\r\nfrom being complete in itself. It necessarily makes far greater demands\r\nupon the individual than does a system of comparative collective\r\nirresponsibility. It implies the selection of peculiarly competent,\r\nenergetic, and responsible individuals to perform the peculiarly\r\ndifficult and exacting parts in a socially constructive drama; and it\r\nimplies, as a necessary condition of such leadership, a progressively\r\nhigher standard of individual training and achievement, unofficial as\r\nwell as official, throughout the whole community. The process of\r\neducating men of moral and intellectual stature sufficient for the\r\nperformance of important constructive work cannot be disentangled from\r\nthe process of national fulfillment by means of intelligent collective\r\naction. American nationality will never be fulfilled except under the\r\nleadership of such men; and the American nation will never obtain the\r\nnecessary leadership unless it seeks seriously the redemption of its\r\nnational responsibility.\r\n\r\nSuch being the situation in general, how can the duty and the\r\nopportunity of the individual at the present time best be defined? Is he\r\nobliged to sit down and wait until the edifying, economic, political,\r\nand social transformation has taken place? Or can he by his own\r\nimmediate behavior do something effectual both to obtain individual\r\nemancipation and to accelerate the desirable process of social\r\nreconstruction? This question has already been partially answered by the\r\nbetter American individual; and it is, I believe, being answered in the\r\nright way. The means which he is taking to reach a more desirable\r\ncondition of individual independence, and inferentially to add a little\r\nsomething to the process of national fulfillment, consist primarily and\r\nchiefly in a thoroughly zealous and competent performance of his own\r\nparticular job; and in taking this means of emancipation and fulfillment\r\nhe is both building better and destroying better than he knows.\r\n\r\nThe last generation of Americans has taken a better method of asserting\r\ntheir individual independence than that practiced by the heretics of the\r\nMiddle Period. Those who were able to gain leadership in business and\r\npolitics sought to justify their success by building up elaborate\r\nindustrial and political organizations which gave themselves and their\r\nsuccessors peculiar individual opportunities. On the other hand, the men\r\nof more specifically intellectual interests tacitly abandoned the\r\nNewer-Worldliness of their predecessors and began unconsciously but\r\nintelligently to seek the attainment of some excellence in the\r\nperformance of their own special work. In almost every case they\r\ndiscovered that the first step in the acquisition of the better\r\nstandards of achievement was to go abroad. If their interests were\r\nscholarly or scientific, they were likely to matriculate at one of the\r\nGerman universities for the sake of studying under some eminent\r\nspecialist. If they were painters, sculptors, or architects, they\r\nflocked to Paris, as the best available source of technical instruction\r\nin the arts. Wherever the better schools were supposed to be, there the\r\nAmerican pupils gathered; and the consequence was during the last\r\nquarter of the nineteenth century a steady and considerable improvement\r\nin the standard of special work and the American schools of special\r\ndiscipline. In this way there was domesticated a necessary condition and\r\nvehicle of the liberation and assertion of American individuality.\r\n\r\nA similar transformation has been taking place in the technical aspects\r\nof American industry. In this field the individual has not been obliged\r\nto make his own opportunities to the same extent as in business,\r\npolitics, and the arts. The opportunities were made for him by the\r\nindustrial development of the country. Efficient special work soon\r\nbecame absolutely necessary in the various branches of manufacture, in\r\nmining, and in the business of transportation; and in the beginning it\r\nwas frequently necessary to import from abroad expert specialists. The\r\ntechnical schools of the country were wholly inadequate to supply the\r\ndemand either for the quantity or the quality of special work needed.\r\nWhen, for instance, the construction of railroads first began, the only\r\ngood engineering school in the country was West Point, and the\r\nconsequence was that many army officers became railroad engineers. But\r\nlittle by little the amount and the standard of technical instruction\r\nimproved; while at the same time the greater industrial organizations\r\nthemselves trained their younger employees with ever increasing\r\nefficiency. Of late years even farming has become an occupation in which\r\nspecial knowledge is supposed to have certain advantages. In every kind\r\nof practical work specialization, founded on a more or less arduous\r\ncourse of preparation, is coming to prevail; and in this way\r\nindividuals, possessing the advantages of the necessary gifts and\r\ndiscipline, are obtaining definite and stimulating opportunities for\r\npersonal efficiency and independence.\r\n\r\nIt would be a grave mistake to conclude, however, that the battle is\r\nalready won--that the individual has already obtained in any department\r\nof practical or intellectual work sufficient personal independence or\r\nsufficiently edifying opportunities. The comparatively zealous and\r\ncompetent individual performer does not, of course, feel so much of an\r\nalien in his social surroundings as he did a generation or two ago. He\r\ncan usually obtain a certain independence of position, a certain amount\r\nof intelligent and formative appreciation, and a sufficiently\r\nsubstantial measure of reward. But he has still much to contend against\r\nin his social, economic, and intellectual environment. His independence\r\nis precarious. In some cases it is won with too little effort. In other\r\ncases it can be maintained only at too great a cost. His rewards, if\r\nsubstantial, can be obtained as readily by sacrificing the integrity of\r\nhis work as by remaining faithful thereto. The society in which he\r\nlives, and which gives him his encouragement and support, has the\r\nlimitations of a clique. Its encouragement is too conscious; its support\r\ntoo willful. Beyond a certain point its encouragement becomes indeed\r\nrelaxing rather than stimulating, and the aspiring individual is placed\r\nin the situation of having most to fear from the inhabitants of his own\r\nhousehold. His intellectual and moral environment is lukewarm. He is\r\nencouraged to be an individual, but not too much of an individual. He is\r\nencouraged to do good work, but not to do always and uncompromisingly\r\nhis best work. He is trusted, but he is not trusted enough. He believes\r\nin himself, but he does not believe as much in himself and in his\r\nmission as his own highest achievement demands. He is not sufficiently\r\nempowered by the idea that just in so far as he does his best work, and\r\nonly his best work, he is contributing most to national as well as\r\npersonal fulfillment.\r\n\r\nWhat the better American individual particularly needs, then, is a\r\ncompleter faith in his own individual purpose and power--a clearer\r\nunderstanding of his own individual opportunities. He needs to do what\r\nhe has been doing, only more so, and with the conviction that thereby he\r\nis becoming not less but more of an American. His patriotism, instead of\r\nbeing something apart from his special work, should be absolutely\r\nidentified therewith, because no matter how much the eminence of his\r\npersonal achievement may temporarily divide him from his\r\nfellow-countrymen, he is, by attaining to such an eminence, helping in\r\nthe most effectual possible way to build the only fitting habitation for\r\na sincere democracy. He is to make his contribution to individual\r\nimprovement primarily by making himself more of an individual. The\r\nindividual as well as the nation must be educated and \"uplifted\" chiefly\r\nby what the individual can do for himself. Education, like charity,\r\nshould begin at home.\r\n\r\nAn individual can, then, best serve the cause of American individuality\r\nby effectually accomplishing his own individual emancipation--that is,\r\nby doing his own special work with ability, energy, disinterestedness,\r\nand excellence. The scope of the individual's opportunities at any one\r\ntime will depend largely upon society, but whatever they amount to, the\r\nindividual has no excuse for not making the most of them. Before he can\r\nbe of any service to his fellows, he must mold himself into the\r\ncondition and habit of being a good instrument. On this point there can\r\nbe no compromise. Every American who has the opportunity of doing\r\nfaithful and fearless work, and who proves faithless to it, belongs to\r\nthe perfect type of the individual anti-democrat. By cheapening his own\r\npersonality he has cheapened the one constituent of the national life\r\nover which he can exercise most effectual control; and thereafter, no\r\nmatter how superficially patriotic and well-intentioned he may be, his\r\nwords and his actions are tainted and are in some measure corrupting in\r\ntheir social effect.\r\n\r\nA question will, however, immediately arise as to the nature of this\r\ndesirable individual excellence. It is all very well to say that a man\r\nshould do his work competently, faithfully, and fearlessly, but how are\r\nwe to define the standard of excellence? When a man is seeking to do his\r\nbest, how shall he go about it? Success in any one of these individual\r\npursuits demands that the individual make some sort of a personal\r\nimpression. He must seek according to the nature of the occupation a\r\nmore or less numerous popular following. The excellence of a painter's\r\nwork does not count unless he can find at least a small group of patrons\r\nwho will admire and buy it. The most competent architect can do nothing\r\nfor himself or for other people unless he attracts clients who will\r\nbuild his paper houses. The playwright needs even a larger following. If\r\nhis plays are to be produced, he must manage to amuse and to interest\r\nthousands of people. And the politician most of all depends upon a\r\nnumerous and faithful body of admirers. Of what avail would his\r\nindependence and competence be in case there were nobody to accept his\r\nleadership? It is not enough, consequently, to assert that the\r\nindividual must emancipate himself by means of excellent and\r\ndisinterested work. His emancipation has no meaning, his career as an\r\nindividual no power, except with the support of a larger or smaller\r\nfollowing. Admitting the desirability of excellent work, what kind of\r\nworkmanlike excellence will make the individual not merely independent\r\nand incorruptible, but powerful? In what way and to what end shall he\r\nuse the instrument, which he is to forge and temper, for his own\r\nindividual benefit and hence for that of society?\r\n\r\nThese questions involve a real difficulty, and before we are through\r\nthey must assuredly be answered; but they are raised at the present\r\nstage of the discussion for the purpose of explicitly putting them aside\r\nrather than for the purpose of answering them. The individual\r\ninstruments must assuredly be forged and tempered to some good use, but\r\nbefore we discuss their employment let us be certain of the instruments\r\nthemselves. Whatever that employment may be and however much of a\r\nfollowing its attainment may demand, the instrument must at any rate be\r\nthoroughly well made, and in the beginning it is necessary to insist\r\nupon merely instrumental excellence, because the American habit and\r\ntradition is to estimate excellence almost entirely by results. If the\r\nindividual will only obtain his following, there need be no close\r\nscrutiny as to his methods. The admirable architect is he who designs\r\nan admirably large number of buildings. The admirable playwright is he\r\nwho by whatever means makes the hearts of his numerous audiences\r\npalpitate. The admirable politician is he who succeeds somehow or anyhow\r\nin gaining the largest area of popular confidence. This tradition is the\r\nmost insidious enemy of American individual independence and\r\nfulfillment. Instead of declaring, as most Americans do, that a man may,\r\nif he can, do good work, but that he _must_ create a following, we\r\nshould declare that a man may, if he can, obtain a following, but that\r\nhe _must_ do good work. When he has done good work, he may not have done\r\nall that is required of him; but if he fails to do good work, nothing\r\nelse counts. The individual democrat who has had the chance and who has\r\nfailed in that essential respect is an individual sham, no matter how\r\nmuch of a shadow his figure casts upon the social landscape.\r\n\r\nThe good work which for his own benefit the individual is required to\r\ndo, means primarily technically competent work. The man who has\r\nthoroughly mastered the knowledge and the craft essential to his own\r\nspecial occupation is by way of being the well-forged and well-tempered\r\ninstrument. Little by little there have been developed in relation to\r\nall the liberal arts and occupations certain tested and approved\r\ntechnical methods. The individual who proposes to occupy himself with\r\nany one of these arts must first master the foundation of knowledge, of\r\nformal traditions, and of manual practice upon which the superstructure\r\nis based. The danger that a part of this fund of technical knowledge and\r\npractice may at any particular time be superannuated must be admitted;\r\nbut the validity of the general rule is not affected thereby. The most\r\nuseful and effective dissenters are those who were in the beginning\r\nchildren of the Faith. The individual who is too weak to assert himself\r\nwith the help of an established technical tradition is assuredly too\r\nweak to assert himself without it. The authoritative technical tradition\r\nassociated with any one of the arts of civilization is merely the net\r\nresult of the accumulated experience of mankind in a given region. That\r\nexperience may or may not have been exhaustive or adequately defined;\r\nbut in any event its mastery by the individual is merely a matter of\r\npersonal and social economy. It helps to prevent the individual from\r\nidentifying his whole personal career with unnecessary mistakes. It\r\nprovides him with the most natural and serviceable vehicle for\r\nself-expression. It supplies him with a language which reduces to the\r\nlowest possible terms the inevitable chances of misunderstanding. It is\r\nsociety's nearest approach to an authentic standard in relation to the\r\nliberal arts and occupations; and just so far as it is authentic society\r\nis justified in imposing it on the individual.\r\n\r\nThe perfect type of authoritative technical methods are those which\r\nprevail among scientific men in respect to scientific work. No scientist\r\nas such has anything to gain by the use of inferior methods or by the\r\nproduction of inferior work. There is only one standard for all\r\nscientific investigators--the highest standard; and so far as a man\r\nfalls below that standard his inferiority is immediately reflected in\r\nhis reputation. Some scientists make, of course, small contributions to\r\nthe increase of knowledge, and some make comparatively large\r\ncontributions; but just in so far as a man makes any contribution at\r\nall, it is a real contribution, and nothing makes it real but the fact\r\nthat it is recognized. In the Hall of Science exhibitors do not get\r\ntheir work hung upon the line because it tickles the public taste, or\r\nbecause it is \"uplifting,\" or because the jury is kindly and wishes to\r\ngive the exhibitor a chance to earn a little second-rate reputation. The\r\nsame standard is applied to everybody, and the jury is incorruptible.\r\nThe exhibit is nothing if not true, or by way of becoming or being\r\nrecognized as true.\r\n\r\nA technical standard in any one of the liberal or practical arts cannot\r\nbe applied as rigorously as can the standard of scientific truth,\r\nbecause the standard itself is not so authentic. In all these arts many\r\ndifferences of opinion exist among masters as to the methods and forms\r\nwhich should be authoritative; and in so far as such is the case, the\r\nindividual must be allowed to make many apparently arbitrary personal\r\nchoices. The fact that a man has such choices to make is the\r\ncircumstance which most clearly distinguishes the practice of an art\r\nfrom that of a science, but this circumstance, instead of being an\r\nexcuse for technical irresponsibility or mere eclecticism, should, on\r\nthe contrary, stimulate the individual more completely to justify his\r\nchoice. In his work he is fighting the battle not merely of his own\r\npersonal career, but of a method, of a style, of an idea, or of an\r\nideal. The practice of the several arts need not suffer from diversity\r\nof standard, provided the several separate standards are themselves\r\nincorruptible. In all the arts--and by the arts I mean all disinterested\r\nand liberal practical occupations--the difficulty is not that\r\nsufficiently authoritative standards do not exist, but that they are not\r\napplied. The standard which is applied is merely that of the\r\ngood-enough. The juries are either too kindly or too lax or too much\r\ncorrupted by the nature of their own work. They are prevented from being\r\nincorruptible about the work of other people by a sub-conscious\r\napprehension of the fate of their own performances--in case similar\r\nstandards were applied to themselves. Just in so far as the second-rate\r\nperformer is allowed to acquire any standing, he inevitably enters into\r\na conspiracy with his fellows to discourage exhibitions of genuine and\r\nconsiderable excellence, and, of course, to a certain extent he\r\nsucceeds. By the waste which he encourages of good human appreciation,\r\nby the confusion which he introduces into the popular critical\r\nstandards, he helps to effect a popular discrimination against any\r\ngenuine superiority of achievement.\r\n\r\nIndividual independence and fulfillment is conditioned on the technical\r\nexcellence of the individual's work, because the most authentic standard\r\nis for the time being constituted by excellence of this kind. An\r\nauthentic standard must be based either upon acquired knowledge or an\r\naccepted ideal. Americans have no popularly accepted ideals which are\r\nanything but an embarrassment to the aspiring individual. In the course\r\nof time some such ideals may be domesticated--in which case the\r\nconditions of individual excellence would be changed; but we are dealing\r\nwith the present and not with the future. Under current conditions the\r\nonly authentic standard must be based, not upon the social influence of\r\nthe work, but upon its quality; and a standard of this kind, while it\r\nfalls short of being complete, must always persist as one indispensable\r\ncondition of final excellence. The whole body of acquired technical\r\nexperience and practice has precisely the same authority as any other\r\nbody of knowledge. The respect it demands is similar to the respect\r\ndemanded by science in all its forms. In this particular case the\r\nscience is neither complete nor entirely trustworthy, but it is\r\nsufficiently complete and trustworthy for the individual's purpose, and\r\ncan be ignored only at the price of waste, misunderstanding, and partial\r\ninefficiency and sterility.\r\n\r\nA standard of uncompromising technical excellence contains, however, for\r\nthe purpose of this argument, a larger meaning than that which is\r\nusually attached to the phrase. A technically competent performance is\r\nordinarily supposed to mean one which displays a high degree of manual\r\ndexterity; and a man who has acquired such a degree of dexterity is also\r\nsupposed to be the victim of his own mastery. No doubt such is\r\nfrequently the case; but in the present meaning the thoroughly competent\r\nindividual workman becomes necessarily very much more of an individual\r\nthan any man can be who is merely the creature of his own technical\r\nfacility and preoccupation. I have used the word art not in the sense\r\nmerely of fine art, but in the sense of all liberal and disinterested\r\npractical work; and the excellent performance of that work demands\r\ncertain qualifications which are common to all the arts as well as\r\npeculiar to the methods and materials of certain particular arts and\r\ncrafts. These qualifications are both moral and intellectual. They\r\nrequire that no one shall be admitted to the ranks of thoroughly\r\ncompetent performers until he is morally and intellectually, as well as\r\nscientifically and manually, equipped for excellent work, and these\r\nappropriate moral and intellectual standards should be applied as\r\nincorruptibly as those born of specific technical practices.\r\n\r\nA craftsman whose merits do not go beyond technical facility is probably\r\ndeficient in both the intellectual and moral qualities essential to good\r\nwork. The rule cannot be rigorously applied, because the boundaries\r\nbetween high technical proficiency and some very special examples of\r\ngenuine mastery are often very indistinct. Still, the majority of\r\ncraftsmen who are nothing more than, manually dexterous are rarely\r\neither sincere or disinterested in their personal attitude towards their\r\noccupation. They have not made themselves the sort of moral instrument\r\nwhich is capable of eminent achievement, and whenever unmistakable\r\nexamples of such a lack of sincerity and conviction are distinguished,\r\nthey should in the interest of a complete standard of special excellence\r\nmeet with the same reprobation as would manual incompetence. It must\r\nnot be inferred, however, that the standard of moral judgment applied to\r\nthe individual in the performance of his particular work is identical\r\nwith a comprehensive standard of moral practice. A man may be an\r\nacceptable individual instrument in the service of certain of the arts,\r\neven though he be in some other respects a tolerably objectionable\r\nperson. A single-minded and disinterested attempt to obtain mastery of\r\nany particular occupation may in specific instances force a man to\r\nneglect certain admirable and in other relations essential qualities. He\r\nmay be a faithless husband, a treacherous friend, a sturdy liar, or a\r\nprofessional bankrupt, without necessarily interfering with the\r\nexcellent performance of his special job. A man who breaks a road to\r\nindividual distinction by such questionable means may always be tainted;\r\nbut he is a better public servant than would be some comparatively\r\nimpeccable nonentity. It all depends on the nature and the requirements\r\nof the particular task, and the extent to which a man has really made\r\nsacrifices in order to accomplish it. There are many special jobs which\r\nabsolutely demand scrupulous veracity, loyalty in a man's personal\r\nrelations, or financial integrity. The politician who ruins his career\r\nin climbing down a waterspout, or the engineer who prevents his\r\nemployers from trusting his judgment and conscience in money matters,\r\ncannot plead in extenuation any other sort of instrumental excellence.\r\nThey have deserved to fail, because they have trifled with their job;\r\nand it may be added that serious moral delinquencies are usually grave\r\nhindrances to a man's individual efficiency.\r\n\r\nFrom the intellectual point of view also technical competence means\r\nsomething more than manual proficiency. Just as the master must possess\r\nthose moral qualities essential to the integrity of his work, so he must\r\npossess the corresponding intellectual qualities. All the liberal arts\r\nrequire, as a condition of mastery, a certain specific and considerable\r\npower of intelligence; and this power of intelligence is to be sharply\r\ndistinguished from all-round intellectual ability. From our present\r\npoint of view its only necessary application concerns the problems of a\r\nman's special occupation. Every special performer needs the power of\r\ncriticising the quality and the subject-matter of his own work. Unless\r\nhe has great gifts or happens to be brought up and trained under\r\npeculiarly propitious conditions, his first attempts to practice his\r\nart will necessarily be experimental. He will be sure to commit many\r\nmistakes, not merely in the choice of alternative methods and the\r\nselection of his subject-matter, but in the extent to which he\r\npersonally can approve or disapprove of his own achievements. The\r\nthoroughly competent performer must at least possess the intellectual\r\npower of profiting from this experience. A candid consideration of his\r\nown experiments must guide him in the selection of the better methods,\r\nin the discrimination of the more appropriate subject-matter, in the\r\navoidance of his own peculiar failings, and in the cultivation of his\r\nown peculiar strength. The technical career of the master is up to a\r\ncertain point always a matter of growth. The technical career of the\r\nsecond-rate man is always a matter of degeneration or at best of\r\nrepetition. The former brings with it its own salient and special form\r\nof enlightenment based upon the intellectual power to criticise his own\r\nexperience and the moral power to act on his own acquired insight. To\r\nthis extent he becomes more of a man by the very process of becoming\r\nmore of a master.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual power required to criticise one's own experience with a\r\nformative result will of course vary considerably in different\r\noccupations. Technical mastery of the occupation of playwriting,\r\ncriticism, or statesmanship, will require more specifically intellectual\r\nqualities than will be demanded by the competent musician or painter.\r\nBut no matter how much intelligence may be needed, the way in which it\r\nshould be used remains the same. Mere industry, aspiration, or a fluid\r\nrun of ideas make as meager an equipment for a politician, a\r\nphilanthropist, or a critic as they would for an architect; and\r\nabsolutely the most dangerous mistake which an individual can make is\r\nthat of confusing admirable intentions expressed in some inferior manner\r\nwith genuine excellence of achievement. If such men succeed, they are\r\ncorrupting in their influence. If they fail, they learn nothing from\r\ntheir failure, because they are always charging up to the public,\r\ninstead of to themselves, the responsibility for their inferiority.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that at the present time an individual American's\r\nintentions and opinions are of less importance than his power of giving\r\nthem excellent and efficient expression. What the individual can do is\r\nto make himself a better instrument for the practice of some\r\nserviceable art; and by so doing he can scarcely avoid becoming also a\r\nbetter instrument for the fulfillment of the American national Promise.\r\nTo be sure, the American national Promise demands for its fulfillment\r\nsomething more than efficient and excellent individual instruments. It\r\ndemands, or will eventually demand, that these individuals shall love\r\nand wish to serve their fellow-countrymen, and it will demand\r\nspecifically that in the service of their fellow-countrymen, they shall\r\nreorganize their country's economic, political, and social institutions\r\nand ideas. Just how the making of competent individual instruments will\r\nof its own force assist the process of national reconstruction, we shall\r\nconsider presently; but the first truth to drive home is that all\r\npolitical and social reorganization is a delusion, unless certain\r\nindividuals, capable of edifying practical leadership, have been\r\ndisciplined and trained; and such individuals must always and in some\r\nmeasure be a product of self-discipline. While not only admitting but\r\nproclaiming that the processes of individual and social improvement are\r\nmutually dependent, it is equally true that the initiative cannot be\r\nleft to collective action. The individual must begin and carry as far as\r\nhe can the work of his own emancipation; and for the present he has an\r\nexcuse for being tolerably unscrupulous in so doing. By the successful\r\nassertion of his own claim to individual distinction and eminence, he is\r\ndoing more to revolutionize and reconstruct the American democracy than\r\ncan a regiment of professional revolutionists and reformers.\r\n\r\nProfessional socialists may cherish the notion that their battle is won\r\nas soon as they can secure a permanent popular majority in favor of a\r\nsocialistic policy; but the constructive national democrat cannot\r\nlogically accept such a comfortable illusion. The action of a majority\r\ncomposed of the ordinary type of convinced socialists could and would in\r\na few years do more to make socialism impossible than could be\r\naccomplished by the best and most prolonged efforts of a majority of\r\nmalignant anti-socialists. The first French republicans made by their\r\nbehavior another republic out of the question in France for almost sixty\r\nyears; and the second republican majority did not do so very much\r\nbetter. When the republic came in France it was founded by men who were\r\nnot theoretical democrats, but who understood that a republic was for\r\nthe time being the kind of government best adapted to the national\r\nFrench interest. These theoretical monarchists, but practical\r\nrepublicans, were for the most part more able, more patriotic, and\r\nhigher-minded men than the convinced republicans; and in all probability\r\na third republic, started without their coöperation, would also have\r\nended in a dictatorship. Any substantial advance toward social\r\nreorganization will in the same way be forced by considerations of\r\npublic welfare on a majority of theoretical anti-socialists, because it\r\nis among this class that the most competent and best disciplined\r\nindividuals are usually to be found. The intellectual and moral ability\r\nrequired, not merely to conceive, but to realize a policy of social\r\nreorganization, is far higher than the ability to carry on an ordinary\r\ndemocratic government. When such a standard of individual competence has\r\nbeen attained by a sufficient number of individuals and is applied to\r\neconomic and social questions, some attempt at social reorganization is\r\nbound to be the result,--assuming, of course, the constructive relation\r\nalready admitted between democracy and the social problem.\r\n\r\nThe strength and the weakness of the existing economic and social system\r\nconsist, as we have observed, in the fact that it is based upon the\r\nrealities of contemporary human nature. It is the issue of a\r\ntime-honored tradition, an intense personal interest, and a method of\r\nlife so habitual that it has become almost instinctive. It cannot be\r\nsuccessfully attacked by any body of hostile opinion, unless such a body\r\nof opinion is based upon a more salient individual and social interest\r\nand a more intense and vital method of life. The only alternative\r\ninterest capable of putting up a sufficiently vigorous attack and\r\npushing home an occasional victory is the interest of the individual in\r\nhis own personal independence and fulfillment--an interest which, as we\r\nhave seen, can only issue from integrity and excellence of individual\r\nachievement. An interest of this kind is bound in its social influence\r\nto make for social reorganization, because such reorganization is in\r\nsome measure a condition and accompaniment of its own self-expression;\r\nand the strength of its position and the superiority of its weapons are\r\nso decisive that they should gradually force the existing system to give\r\nway. The defenses of that system have vulnerable points; and its\r\ndefenders are disunited except in one respect. They would be able to\r\nrepel any attack delivered along their whole line; but their binding\r\ninterest is selfish and tends under certain conditions to divide them\r\none from another without bestowing on the divided individuals the energy\r\nof independence and self-possession. Their position can be attacked at\r\nits weaker points, not only without meeting with combined resistance,\r\nbut even with the assistance of some of their theoretical allies. Many\r\nconvinced supporters of the existing order are men of superior merit,\r\nwho are really fighting against their own better individual interests;\r\nand they need only to taste the exhilaration of freedom in order better\r\nto understand its necessary social and economical conditions. Others,\r\nalthough men of inferior achievement, are patriotic and well-intentioned\r\nin feeling; and they may little by little be brought to believe that\r\npatriotism in a democracy demands the sacrifice of selfish interests and\r\nthe regeneration of individual rights. Men of this stamp can be made\r\nwilling prisoners by able and aggressive leaders whose achievements have\r\ngiven them personal authority and whose practical programme is based\r\nupon a sound knowledge of the necessary limits of immediate national\r\naction. The disinterested and competent individual is formed for\r\nconstructive leadership, just as the less competent and independent, but\r\nwell-intentioned, individual is formed more or less faithfully to follow\r\non behind. Such leadership, in a country whose traditions and ideals are\r\nsincerely democratic, can scarcely go astray.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTIVE INDIVIDUALISM\r\n\r\nThe preceding section was concluded with a statement, which the majority\r\nof its readers will find extremely questionable and which assuredly\r\ndemands some further explanation. Suppose it to be admitted that\r\nindividual Americans do seek the increase of their individuality by\r\ncompetent and disinterested special work. In what way will such work and\r\nthe sort of individuality thereby developed exercise a decisive\r\ninfluence on behalf of social amelioration? We have already expressly\r\ndenied that a desire to succor their fellow-countrymen or an ideal of\r\nsocial reorganization is at the present time a necessary ingredient in\r\nthe make-up of these formative individuals. Their individual excellence\r\nhas been defined exclusively in terms of high but special technical\r\ncompetence; and the manner in which these varied and frequently\r\nantagonistic individual performers are to coöperate towards socially\r\nconstructive results must still remain a little hazy. How are these\r\neminent specialists, each of whom is admittedly pursuing unscrupulously\r\nhis own special purpose, to be made serviceable in a coherent national\r\ndemocratic organization? How, indeed, are these specialists to get at\r\nthe public whom they are supposed to lead? Many very competent\r\ncontemporary Americans might claim that the real difficulty in relation\r\nto the social influence of the expert specialist has been sedulously\r\nevaded. The admirably competent individual cannot exercise any\r\nconstructive social influence, unless he becomes popular; and the\r\ncurrent American standards being what they are, how can an individual\r\nbecome popular without more or less insidious and baleful compromises?\r\nThe gulf between individual excellence and effective popular influence\r\nstill remains to be bridged; and until it is bridged, an essential stage\r\nis lacking in the transition from an individually formative result to\r\none that is also socially formative.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, a gulf does exist in the country between individual\r\nexcellence and effective popular influence. Many excellent specialists\r\nexercise a very small amount of influence, and many individuals who\r\nexercise apparently a great deal of influence are conspicuously lacking\r\nin any kind of excellence. The responsibility for this condition is\r\nusually fastened upon the Philistine American public, which refuses to\r\nrecognize genuine eminence and which showers rewards upon any\r\nsecond-rate performer who tickles its tastes and prejudices. But it is\r\nat least worth inquiring whether the responsibility should not be\r\nfastened, not upon the followers, but upon the supposed leaders. The\r\nAmerican people are what the circumstances, the traditional leadership,\r\nand the interests of American life have made them. They cannot be\r\nexpected to be any better than they are, until they have been\r\nsufficiently shown the way; and they cannot be blamed for being as bad\r\nas they are, until it is proved that they have deliberately rejected\r\nbetter leadership. No such proof has ever been offered.\r\n\r\nSome disgruntled Americans talk as if in a democracy the path of the\r\naspiring individual should be made peculiarly safe and easy. As soon as\r\nany young man appears whose ideals are perched a little higher than\r\nthose of his neighbors, and who has acquired some knack of performance,\r\nhe should apparently be immediately taken at his own valuation and\r\nloaded with rewards and opportunities. The public should take off its\r\nhat and ask him humbly to step into the limelight and show himself off\r\nfor the popular edification. He should not be obliged to make himself\r\ninteresting to the public. They should immediately make themselves\r\ninterested in him, and bolt whatever he chooses to offer them as the\r\nvery meat and wine of the mind. But surely one does not need to urge\r\nvery emphatically that popularity won upon such easy terms would be\r\ndemoralizing to any but very highly gifted and very cool-headed men. The\r\nAmerican people are absolutely right in insisting that an aspirant for\r\npopular eminence shall be compelled to make himself interesting to them,\r\nand shall not be welcomed as a fountain of excellence and enlightenment\r\nuntil he has found some means of forcing his meat and his wine down\r\ntheir reluctant throats. And if the aspiring individual accepts this\r\ncondition as tantamount to an order that he must haul down the flag of\r\nhis own individual purpose in order to obtain popular appreciation and\r\nreward, it is he who is unworthy to lead, not they who are unworthy of\r\nbeing led. The problem and business of his life is precisely that of\r\nkeeping his flag flying at any personal cost or sacrifice; and if his\r\nown particular purpose demands that his flying flag shall be loyally\r\nsaluted, it is his own business also to see that his flag is well worthy\r\nof a popular salutation. In occasional instances these two aspects of a\r\nspecial performer's business may prove to be incompatible. Every real\r\nadventure must be attended by risks. Every real battle involves a\r\ncertain number of casualties. But better the risk and the wounded and\r\nthe dead than sham battles and unearned victories.\r\n\r\nThere is only one way in which popular standards and preferences can be\r\nimproved. The men whose standards are higher must learn to express their\r\nbetter message in a popularly interesting manner. The people will never\r\nbe converted to the appreciation of excellent special performances by\r\nargumentation, reproaches, lectures, associations, or persuasion. They\r\nwill rally to the good thing, only because the good thing has been made\r\nto look good to them; and so far as individual Americans are not capable\r\nof making their good things look good to a sufficient number of their\r\nfellow-countrymen, they will on the whole deserve any neglect from which\r\nthey may suffer. They themselves constitute the only efficient source of\r\nreally formative education. In so far as a public is lacking, a public\r\nmust be created. They must mold their followers after their own\r\nlikeness--as all aspirants after the higher individual eminence have\r\nalways been obliged to do.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the result is to be brought about may be traced by\r\nconsidering the case of the contemporary American architect--a case\r\nwhich is typical because, while popular architectural preferences are\r\ninferior, the very existence of the architect depends upon his ability\r\nto please a considerable number of clients. The average well-trained\r\narchitect in good standing meets this situation by designing as well as\r\nhe can, consistent with the building-up an abundant and lucrative\r\npractice. There are doubtless certain things which he would not do even\r\nto get or keep a job; but on the whole it is not unfair to say that his\r\nfirst object is to get and to keep the job, and his second to do good\r\nwork. The consequence is that, in compromising the integrity of his\r\nwork, he necessarily builds his own practice upon a shifting foundation.\r\nHis work belongs to the well-populated class of the good-enough. It can\r\nhave little distinctive excellence; and it cannot, by its peculiar force\r\nand quality, attract a clientele. Presumably, it has the merit of\r\nsatisfying prevailing tastes; but the architect, who is designing only\r\nas well as popular tastes will permit, suffers under one serious\r\ndisadvantage. There are hundreds of his associates who can do it just as\r\nwell; and he is necessarily obliged to face demoralizing competition.\r\nInasmuch as it is not his work itself that counts, he is obliged to\r\nbuild up his clientele by other means. He is obliged to make himself\r\npersonally popular, to seek social influence and private \"pulls\"; and\r\nhis whole life becomes that of a man who is selling his personality\r\ninstead of fulfilling it. His relations with his clients suffer from the\r\nsame general condition. They have come to him, not because they are\r\nparticularly attracted by his work and believe in it, but, as a rule,\r\nbecause of some accidental and arbitrary reason. His position,\r\nconsequently, is lacking in independence and authority. He has not\r\nenough personal prestige as a designer to insist upon having his own way\r\nin all essential matters. He tends to become too much of an agent,\r\nemployed for the purpose of carrying out another man's wishes, instead\r\nof a professional expert, whose employer trusts his judgment and leans\r\nloyally on his advice.\r\n\r\nTake, on the other hand, the case of the exceptional architect who\r\ninsists upon doing his very best. Assuming sufficient ability and\r\ntraining, the work of the man who does his very best is much more likely\r\nto possess some quality of individual merit, which more or less sharply\r\ndistinguishes it from that of other architects. He has a monopoly of his\r\nown peculiar qualities. Such merit may not be noticed by many people;\r\nbut it will probably be noticed by a few. The few who are attracted will\r\nreceive a more than usually vivid impression. They will talk, and begin\r\nto create a little current of public opinion favorable to the designer.\r\nThe new clients who come to him will be influenced either by their\r\nappreciation of the actual merit of the work or by this approving body\r\nof opinion. They will come, that is, because they want _him_ and believe\r\nin his work. His own personal position, consequently, becomes much more\r\nindependent and authoritative than is usually the case. He is much less\r\nlikely to be embarrassed by ignorant and irrelevant interference. He can\r\ncontinue to turn out designs genuinely expressive of his own individual\r\npurpose. If he be an intelligent as well as a sincere and gifted\r\ndesigner, his work will, up to a certain point, grow in distinction and\r\nindividuality; and as good or better examples of it become more\r\nnumerous, it will attract and hold an increasing body of approving\r\nopinion. The designer will in this way have gradually created his own\r\nspecial public. He will be molding and informing the architectural taste\r\nand preference of his admirers. Without in any way compromising his own\r\nstandards, he will have brought himself into a constructive relation\r\nwith a part at least of the public, and the effect of his work will soon\r\nextend beyond the sphere of his own personal clientele. In so far as he\r\nhas succeeded in popularizing a better quality of architectural work, he\r\nwould be by way of strengthening the hands of all of his associates who\r\nwere standing for similar ideals and methods.\r\n\r\nIt would be absurd to claim that every excellent and competent special\r\nperformer who sticks incorruptibly to his individual purpose and\r\nstandard can succeed in creating a special public, molded somewhat by\r\nhis personal influence. The ability to succeed is not given to\r\neverybody. It cannot always be obtained by sincere industry and able and\r\nsingle-minded work. The qualities needed in addition to those mentioned\r\nwill vary in different occupations and according to the accidental\r\ncircumstances of different cases; but they are not always the qualities\r\nwhich a man can acquire. Men will fail who have deserved to succeed and\r\nwho might have succeeded with a little more tenacity or under slightly\r\nmore favorable conditions. Men who have deserved to fail will succeed\r\nbecause of certain collateral but partly irrelevant merits--just as an\r\narchitect may succeed who is ingenious about making his clients' houses\r\ncomfortable and building them cheap. In a thousand different ways an\r\nindividual enterprise, conceived and conducted with faith and ability,\r\nmay prove to be abortive. Moreover, the sacrifices necessary to success\r\nare usually genuine sacrifices. The architect who wishes to build up a\r\nreally loyal following by really good work must deliberately reject many\r\npossible jobs; and he must frequently spend upon the accepted jobs more\r\nmoney than is profitable. But the foregoing is merely tantamount to\r\nsaying, as we have said, that the adventure involves a real risk. A\r\nresolute, intelligent man undertakes a doubtful and difficult\r\nenterprise, not because it is sure to succeed, but because if it\r\nsucceeds, it is worth the risk and the cost, and such is the case with\r\nthe contemporary American adventurer. The individual independence,\r\nappreciation, and fulfillment which he secures in the event of success\r\nare assuredly worth a harder and a more dangerous fight than the one by\r\nwhich frequently he is confronted. In any particular case a man, as we\r\nhave admitted, may put up a good fight without securing the fruits of\r\nvictory, and his adventure may end, not merely in defeat, but in\r\nself-humiliation. But if any general tendency exists to shirk, or to\r\nback down, or to place the responsibility for personal ineptitude on the\r\npublic, it means, not that the fight was hopeless, but that the warriors\r\nwere lacking in the necessary will and ability.\r\n\r\nThe case of the statesman, the man of letters, the philanthropist, or\r\nthe reformer does not differ essentially from that of the architect.\r\nThey may need for their particular purposes a larger or a smaller\r\npopular following, a larger or smaller amount of moral courage, and a\r\nmore or less peculiar kind of intellectual efficiency; but wherever\r\nthere is any bridge to be built between their own purposes and standards\r\nand those of the public, they must depend chiefly upon their own\r\nresources for its construction. The best that society can do to assist\r\nthem at present is to establish good schools of preliminary instruction.\r\nFor the rest it is the particular business of the exceptional individual\r\nto impose himself on the public; and the necessity he is under of\r\ncreating his own following may prove to be helpful to him as his own\r\nexceptional achievements are to his followers. The fact that he is\r\nobliged to make a public instead of finding one ready-made, or instead\r\nof being able by the subsidy of a prince to dispense with one--this\r\nnecessity will in the long run tend to keep his work vital and human.\r\nThe danger which every peculiarly able individual specialist runs is\r\nthat of overestimating the value of his own purpose and achievements,\r\nand so of establishing a false and delusive relation between his own\r\nworld and the larger world of human affairs and interests. Such a danger\r\ncannot be properly checked by the conscious moral and intellectual\r\neducation of the individual, because when he is filled too full of\r\namiable intentions and ideas, he is by way of attenuating his individual\r\nimpulse and power. But the individual who is forced to create his own\r\npublic is forced also to make his own special work attractive to a\r\npublic; and when he succeeds in accomplishing this result without\r\nhauling down his personal flag, his work tends to take on a more normal\r\nand human character.\r\n\r\nIt tends, that is, to be socially as well as individually formative. The\r\npeculiarly competent individual is obliged to accept the\r\nresponsibilities of leadership with its privileges and fruits. There is\r\nno escape from the circle by which he finds himself surrounded. He\r\ncannot obtain the opportunities, the authority, and the independence\r\nwhich he needs for his own individual fulfillment, unless he builds up a\r\nfollowing; and he cannot build up a secure personal following without\r\nmaking his peculiar performances appeal to some general human interest.\r\nThe larger and more general the interest he can arouse, the more secure\r\nand the more remunerative his personal independence becomes. It by no\r\nmeans necessarily follows that he will increase his following by\r\nincreasing the excellence of his work, or that he will not frequently\r\nfind it difficult to keep his following without allowing his work to\r\ndeteriorate. No formula, reconciling the individual and the popular\r\ninterest, can be devised which will work automatically. The\r\nreconciliation must always remain a matter of victorious individual or\r\nnational contrivance. But it is none the less true that the chance of\r\nfruitful reconciliation always exists, and in a democracy it should\r\nexist under peculiarly wholesome conditions. The essential nature of a\r\ndemocracy compels it to insist that individual power of all kinds,\r\npolitical, economic, or intellectual, shall not be perversely and\r\nirresponsibly exercised. The individual democrat is obliged no less to\r\ninsist in his own interest that the responsible exercise of power shall\r\nnot be considered equivalent to individual mediocrity and dependence.\r\nThese two demands will often conflict; but the vitality of a democracy\r\nhangs upon its ability to keep both of them vigorous and assertive. Just\r\nin so far as individual democrats find ways of asserting their\r\nindependence in the very act of redeeming their responsibility, the\r\nsocial body of which they form a part is marching toward the goal of\r\nhuman betterment.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be claimed, however, that the foregoing account of the\r\nrelation between the individual and a nationalized democracy is even yet\r\nentirely satisfactory. No relation can be satisfactory which implies\r\nsuch a vast amount of individual suffering and defeat and such a huge\r\nwaste of social and individual effort. The relation is only as\r\nsatisfactory as it can be made under the circumstances. The individual\r\ncannot be immediately transformed by individual purpose and action into\r\na consummate social type, any more than society can be immediately\r\ntransformed by purposive national action into a consummate residence for\r\nthe individual. In both cases amelioration is a matter of intelligent\r\nexperimental contrivance based upon the nature of immediate conditions\r\nand equipped with every available resource and weapon. In both cases\r\nthese experiments must be indefinitely continued, their lessons candidly\r\nlearned, and the succeeding experiments based upon past failures and\r\nachievements. Throughout the whole task of experimental educational\r\nadvance the different processes of individual and social amelioration\r\nwill be partly opposed, partly supplementary, and partly parallel; but\r\nin so far as any genuine advance is made, the opposition should be less\r\ncostly, and coöperation, if not easier, at least more remunerative.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar kind of individual self-assertion which has been outlined\r\nin the foregoing sections of this chapter has been adapted, not to\r\nperfect, but to actual moral, social, and intellectual conditions. For\r\nthe present Americans must cultivate competent individual independence\r\nsomewhat unscrupulously, because their peculiar democratic tradition has\r\nhitherto discouraged and under-valued a genuinely individualistic\r\npractice and ideal. In order to restore the balance, the individual must\r\nemancipate himself at a considerable sacrifice and by somewhat forcible\r\nmeans; and to a certain extent he must continue those sacrifices\r\nthroughout the whole of his career. He must proclaim and, if able, he\r\nmust assert his own leadership, but he must be always somewhat on his\r\nguard against his followers. He must always keep in mind that the very\r\nleadership which is the fruit of his mastery and the condition of his\r\nindependence is also, considering the nature and disposition of his\r\naverage follower, a dangerous temptation; and while he must not for that\r\nreason scorn popular success, he must always conscientiously reckon its\r\nactual cost. And just because a leader cannot wholly trust himself to\r\nhis following, so the followers must always keep a sharp lookout lest\r\ntheir leaders be leading them astray. For the kind of leadership which\r\nwe have postulated above is by its very definition and nature liable to\r\nbecome perverse and distracting.\r\n\r\nBut just in so far as the work of social and individual amelioration\r\nadvances, the condition will be gradually created necessary to completer\r\nmutual confidence between the few exceptional leaders and the many\r\n\"plain people.\" At present the burden of establishing any genuine means\r\nof communication rests very heavily upon the exceptionally able\r\nindividual. But after a number of exceptionally able individuals have\r\nimposed their own purposes and standards and created a following, they\r\nwill have made the task of their successors easier. Higher technical\r\nstandards and more adequate forms of expression will have become better\r\nestablished. The \"public\" will have learned to expect and to appreciate\r\nmore simple and appropriate architectural forms, more sincere and\r\nbetter-formed translations of life in books and on the stage, and more\r\nindependent and better equipped political leadership. The \"public,\" that\r\nis, instead of being as much satisfied as it is at present with cheap\r\nforms and standards, will be prepared to assume part of the expense of\r\nestablishing better forms and methods of social intercourse. In this way\r\na future generation of leaders may be enabled to conquer a following\r\nwith a smaller individual expenditure of painful sacrifices and wasted\r\neffort. They can take for granted a generally higher technical and\r\nformal tradition, and they themselves will be freed from an\r\nover-conscious preoccupation with the methods and the mechanism of their\r\nwork. Their attention will naturally be more than ever concentrated on\r\nthe proper discrimination of their subject-matter; and just in so far as\r\nthey are competent to create an impression or a following, that\r\nimpression should be more profound and the following more loyal and more\r\nworthy of loyalty.\r\n\r\nAbove all, a substantial improvement in the purposes and standards of\r\nindividual self-expression should create a more bracing intellectual\r\natmosphere. Better standards will serve not only as guides but as\r\nweapons. In so far as they are embodied in competent performances, they\r\nare bound also to be applied in the critical condemnation of inferior\r\nwork; and the critic himself will assume a much more important practical\r\njob than he now has. Criticism is a comparatively neglected art among\r\nAmericans, because a sufficient number of people do not care whether and\r\nwhen the current practices are really good or bad. The practice of\r\nbetter standards and their appreciation will give the critic both a more\r\nsubstantial material for his work and a larger public. It will be his\r\nduty to make the American public conscious of the extent of the\r\nindividual successes or failures and the reasons therefor; and in case\r\nhis practice improves with that of the other arts, he should become a\r\nmore important performer, not only because of his better opportunities\r\nand public, but because of his increase of individual prowess. He should\r\nnot only be better equipped for the performance of his work and the\r\ncreation of a public following, but he should have a more definite and\r\nresolute conviction of the importance of his own job. It is the business\r\nof the competent individual as a type to force society to recognize the\r\nmeaning and the power of his own special purposes. It is the special\r\nbusiness of the critic to make an ever larger portion of the public\r\nconscious of these expressions of individual purpose, of their relations\r\none to another, of their limitations, and of their promises. He not only\r\npopularizes and explains for the benefit of a larger public the\r\nsubstance and significance of admirable special performance, but he\r\nshould in a sense become the standard bearer of the whole movement.\r\n\r\nThe function of the critic hereafter will consist in part of carrying on\r\nan incessant and relentless warfare on the prevailing American\r\nintellectual insincerity. He can make little headway unless he is\r\nsustained by a large volume of less expressly controversial individual\r\nintellectual self-expression; but on the other hand, there are many\r\nserious obstructions to any advancing intellectual movement, which he\r\nshould and must overthrow. In so doing he has every reason to be more\r\nunscrupulous and aggressive even than his brethren-in-arms. He must stab\r\naway at the gelatinous mass of popular indifference, sentimentality, and\r\ncomplacency, even though he seems quite unable to penetrate to the quick\r\nand draw blood. For the time the possibility of immediate constructive\r\nachievement in his own special field is comparatively small, and he is\r\nthe less responsible for the production of any substantial effect, or\r\nthe building up of any following except a handful of free lances like\r\nhimself. He need only assure himself of his own competence with his own\r\npeculiar tools, his own good-humored sincerity, and his\r\ndisinterestedness in the pursuit of his legitimate purposes, in order to\r\nfeel fully justified in pushing his strokes home. In all serious\r\nwarfare, people have to be really wounded for some good purpose; and in\r\nthis particular fight there may be some chance that not only a good\r\ncause, but the very victim of the blow, may possibly be benefited by its\r\ndelivery. The stabbing of a mass of public opinion into some\r\nconsciousness of its active torpor, particularly when many particles of\r\nthe mass are actively torpid because of admirable patriotic\r\nintentions,--that is a job which needs sharp weapons, intense personal\r\ndevotion, and a positive indifference to consequences.\r\n\r\nYet if the American national Promise is ever to be fulfilled, a more\r\ncongenial and a more interesting task will also await the\r\ncritic--meaning by the word \"critic\" the voice of the specific\r\nintellectual interest, the lover of wisdom, the seeker of the truth.\r\nEvery important human enterprise has its meaning, even though the\r\nconduct of the affair demands more than anything else a hard and\r\ninextinguishable faith. Such a faith will imply a creed; and its\r\nrealizations will go astray unless the faithful are made conscious of\r\nthe meaning of their performances or failures. The most essential and\r\nedifying business of the critic will always consist in building up \"a\r\npile of better thoughts,\" based for the most part upon the truth\r\nresident in the lives of their predecessors and contemporaries, but not\r\nwithout its outlook toward an immediate and even remote future. There\r\ncan be nothing final about the creed unless there be something final\r\nabout the action and purposes of which it is the expression. It must be\r\nconstantly modified in order to define new experiences and renewed in\r\norder to meet unforeseen emergencies. But it should grow, just in so far\r\nas the enterprise itself makes new conquests and unfolds new aspects of\r\ntruth. Democracy is an enterprise of this kind. It may prove to be the\r\nmost important moral and social enterprise as yet undertaken by mankind;\r\nbut it is still a very young enterprise, whose meaning and promise is by\r\nno means clearly understood. It is continually meeting unforeseen\r\nemergencies and gathering an increasing experience. The fundamental duty\r\nof a critic in a democracy is to see that the results of these\r\nexperiences are not misinterpreted and that the best interpretation is\r\nembodied in popular doctrinal form. The critic consequently is not so\r\nmuch the guide as the lantern which illuminates the path. He may not\r\npretend to know the only way or all the ways; but he should know as much\r\nas can be known about the traveled road.\r\n\r\nMen endowed with high moral gifts and capable of exceptional moral\r\nachievements have also their special part to play in the building of an\r\nenduring democratic structure. In the account which has been given of\r\nthe means and conditions of democratic fulfillment, the importance of\r\nthis part has been under-estimated; but the under-estimate has been\r\ndeliberate. It is very easy and in a sense perfectly true to declare\r\nthat democracy needs for its fulfillment a peculiarly high standard of\r\nmoral behavior; and it is even more true to declare that a democratic\r\nscheme of moral values reaches its consummate expression in the religion\r\nof human brotherhood. Such a religion can be realized only through the\r\nloving-kindness which individuals feel toward their fellow-men and\r\nparticularly toward their fellow-countrymen; and it is through such\r\nfeelings that the network of mutual loyalties and responsibilities woven\r\nin a democratic nation become radiant and expansive. Whenever an\r\nindividual democrat, like Abraham Lincoln, emerges, who succeeds in\r\noffering an example of specific efficiency united with supreme\r\nkindliness of feeling, he qualifies as a national hero of consummate\r\nvalue. But--at present--a profound sense of human brotherhood is no\r\nsubstitute for specific efficiency. The men most possessed by intense\r\nbrotherly feelings usually fall into an error, as Tolstoy has done, as\r\nto the way in which those feelings can be realized. Consummate faith\r\nitself is no substitute for good work. Back of any work of moral\r\nconversion must come a long and slow process of social reorganization\r\nand individual emancipation; and not until the reorganization has been\r\npartly accomplished, and the individual released, disciplined and\r\npurified, will the soil be prepared for the crowning work of some\r\ndemocratic Saint Francis.\r\n\r\nHence, in the foregoing account of a possible democratic fulfillment,\r\nattention has been concentrated on that indispensable phase of the work\r\nwhich can be attained by conscious means. Until this work is measurably\r\naccomplished no evangelist can do more than convert a few men for a few\r\nyears. But it has been admitted throughout that the task of individual\r\nand social regeneration must remain incomplete and impoverished, until\r\nthe conviction and the feeling of human brotherhood enters into\r\npossession of the human spirit. The laborious work of individual and\r\nsocial fulfillment may eventually be transfigured by an outburst of\r\nenthusiasm--one which is not the expression of a mood, but which is\r\nsubstantially the finer flower of an achieved experience and a living\r\ntradition. If such a moment ever arrives, it will be partly the creation\r\nof some democratic evangelist--some imitator of Jesus who will reveal to\r\nmen the path whereby they may enter into spiritual possession of their\r\nindividual and social achievements, and immeasurably increase them by\r\nvirtue of personal regeneration.\r\n\r\nBe it understood, however, that no prophecy of any such consummate\r\nmoment has been made. Something of the kind may happen, in case the\r\nAmerican or any other democracy seeks patiently and intelligently to\r\nmake good a complete and a coherent democratic ideal. For better or\r\nworse, democracy cannot be disentangled from an aspiration toward human\r\nperfectibility, and hence from the adoption of measures looking in the\r\ndirection of realizing such an aspiration. It may be that the attempt\r\nwill not be seriously made, or that, if it is, nothing will come of it.\r\nMr. George Santayana concludes a chapter on \"Democracy\" in his \"Reason\r\nin Society\" with the following words: \"For such excellence to grow\r\ngeneral mankind must be notably transformed. If a noble and civilized\r\ndemocracy is to subsist, the common citizen must be something of a saint\r\nand something of a hero. We see, therefore, how justly flattering and\r\nprofound, and at the same time how ominous, was Montesquieu's saying\r\nthat the principle of democracy is virtue.\" The principle of democracy\r\n_is_ virtue, and when we consider the condition of contemporary\r\ndemocracies, the saying may seem to be more ominous than flattering. But\r\nif a few hundred years from now it seems less ominous, the threat will\r\nbe removed in only one way. The common citizen can become something of a\r\nsaint and something of a hero, not by growing to heroic proportions in\r\nhis own person, but by the sincere and enthusiastic imitation of heroes\r\nand saints, and whether or not he will ever come to such imitation will\r\ndepend upon the ability of his exceptional fellow-countrymen to offer\r\nhim acceptable examples of heroism and saintliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAbolitionism,\r\n  the good American democratic view of, 49;\r\n  belief of supporters of, regarding slavery, 78-79;\r\n  a just estimate of
