Impressed with the idea that we shall be\r\nsupplying an existing want, and aiding materially the cause of\r\nMeteorological Science, in giving a plain description of the various\r\ninstruments now in use, we have endeavoured, in the present volume, to\r\ncondense such information as is generally required regarding the\r\ninstruments used in Meteorology; the description of many of which could\r\nonly be found in elaborate scientific works, and then only briefly touched\r\nupon. Every Meteorological Instrument now in use being fully described,\r\nwith adequate directions for using, the uninitiated will be enabled to\r\nselect those which seem to them best adapted to their requirements. With\r\naccounts of old or obsolete instruments we have avoided troubling the\r\nreader; on the other hand, we were unwilling to neglect those which,\r\nthough of no great practical importance, are still deserving of notice\r\nfrom their being either novel or ingenious, or which, without being\r\nstrictly scientific, are in great demand as simple weather-glasses and\r\narticles of trade.\r\n\r\nWe trust, therefore, that the work (however imperfect), bearing in mind\r\nthe importance of the subject, will be acceptable to general readers, as\r\nwell as to those for whose requirements it has been prepared.\r\n\r\nThe rapid progress made in the introduction of new apparatus of\r\nacknowledged superiority has rendered the publication of some description\r\nabsolutely necessary. The Report of the Jurors for Class XIII. of the\r\nInternational Exhibition, 1862, on Meteorological Instruments, fully bears\r\nout our assertion, as shown by the following extract:--\r\n\r\n\"The progress in the English department has been very great;--in\r\nbarometers, thermometers, anemometers, and in every class of instruments.\r\nAt the close of the Exhibition of 1851, there seemed to have arisen a\r\ngeneral anxiety among the majority of makers to pay every attention to all\r\nthe essentials necessary for philosophical instruments, not only in their\r\nold forms, but also with the view of obtaining other and better forms.\r\nThis desire has never ceased; and no better idea can be given of the\r\ncontinued activity in these respects, than the number of patents taken out\r\nfor improvements in meteorological instruments in the interval between the\r\nrecent and preceding exhibitions, which amount to no less than forty-two.\"\r\n* * * \"In addition to numerous improvements patented by Messrs. Negretti\r\nand Zambra, there is another of great importance, which they did not\r\npatent, viz. enamelling the tubes of thermometers, enabling the makers to\r\nuse finer threads of mercury in the construction of all thermometers; for\r\nthe contrast between the opaque mercury and the enamel back of the tubes\r\nis so great, that the finest bore or thread of mercury, which at one time\r\ncould not be seen without the greatest difficulty, is now seen with\r\nfacility; and throughout the British and Foreign departments, the makers\r\nhave availed themselves of this invention, the tubes of all being made\r\nwith enamelled backs. It is to be hoped that the recent exhibition will\r\ngive a fresh stimulus to the desire of improvement, and that the same rate\r\nof progress will be continued.\"\r\n\r\nTo fulfil the desire of the International Jury in the latter portion of\r\nthe above extract will be the constant study of\r\n\r\nNEGRETTI & ZAMBRA.\r\n\r\n_1st January, 1864._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.

Principle of the Barometer.=--The first instrument which gave the\r\nexact measure of the pressure of the atmosphere was invented by\r\nTorricelli, in 1643. It is constructed as follows:--A glass tube, CD (fig.\r\n1), about 34 inches long, and from two to four-tenths of an inch in\r\ndiameter of bore, having one end closed, is filled with mercury. In a cup,\r\nB, a quantity of mercury is also poured. Then, placing a finger securely\r\nover the open end, C, invert the tube vertically over the cup, and remove\r\nthe finger when the end of the tube dips into the mercury. The mercury in\r\nthe tube then partly falls out, but a column, AB, about 30 inches in\r\nheight, remains supported. This column is a weight of mercury, the\r\npressure of which upon the surface of that in the cup is precisely\r\nequivalent to the corresponding pressure of the atmosphere which would be\r\nexerted in its place if the tube were removed. As the atmospheric pressure\r\nvaries, the length of this mercurial column also changes. It is by no\r\nmeans constant in its height; in fact, it is very seldom stationary, but\r\nis constantly rising or falling through a certain extent of the tube, at\r\nthe level of the sea, near which the above experiment is supposed to be\r\nperformed. It is, therefore, an instrument by which the fluctuations\r\ntaking place in the pressure of the atmosphere, arising from changes in\r\nits weight and elasticity, can be shown and measured. It has obtained the\r\nname _Barometer_, or measurer of heaviness,--a word certainly not happily\r\nexpressive of the utility of the invention. If the bore of the barometer\r\ntube be uniform throughout its length, and have its sectional area equal\r\nto a square inch, it is evident that the length of the column, which is\r\nsupported by the pressure of the air, expresses the number of cubic inches\r\nof mercury which compose it. The weight of this mercury, therefore,\r\nrepresents the statical pressure of the atmosphere upon a square inch of\r\nsurface. In England the annual mean height of the barometric column,\r\nreduced to the sea-level and to the temperature of 32 deg. Fahrenheit, is\r\nabout 29.95 inches. A cubic inch of mercury at this temperature has been\r\nascertained to weigh 0.48967 lbs. avoirdupois. Hence, 29.95 x 0.48967=\r\n14.67 lbs., is the mean value of the pressure of the atmosphere on each\r\nsquare inch of surface, near the sea-level, about the latitude of 50\r\ndegrees. Nearer the equator this mean pressure is somewhat greater; nearer\r\nthe poles, somewhat less. For common practical calculations it is assumed\r\nto be 15 lbs. on the square inch. When it became apparent that the\r\nmovements of the barometric column furnished indications of the probable\r\ncoming changes in the weather, an attempt was made to deduce from recorded\r\nobservations the barometric height corresponding to the most notable\r\ncharacteristics of weather. It was found that for fine dry weather the\r\nmercury in the barometer at the sea-level generally stood above 30 inches;\r\nchangeable weather happened when it ranged from 30 to 29 inches, and when\r\nrainy or stormy weather occurred it was even lower. Hence, it became the\r\npractice to place upon barometer scales words indicatory of the weather\r\nlikely to accompany, or follow, the movements of the mercury; whence the\r\ninstruments bearing them obtained the name \"Weather Glasses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Construction of Barometers.=--In order that the instrument may be\r\nportable, it must be made a fixture and mounted on a support; and,\r\nfurther, to render it scientifically or even practically useful, many\r\nprecautions are required in its construction. The following remarks apply\r\nto the construction of all barometers:--Mercury is universally employed,\r\nbecause it is the heaviest of fluids, and therefore measures the\r\natmospheric pressure by the shortest column. Water barometers have been\r\nconstructed, and they require to be at least 34 feet long. Oil, or other\r\nfluids, might be used. Mercury, however, has other advantages: it has\r\nfeeble volatility, and does not adhere to glass, if pure. Oxidised, or\r\notherwise impure mercury, may adhere to glass; moreover, such mercury\r\nwould not have the density of the pure metal, and therefore the barometric\r\ncolumn would be either greater or less than it should be. The mercury of\r\ncommerce generally contains lead; sometimes traces of iron and sulphur. It\r\nis necessary, therefore, for the manufacturer to purify the mercury; and\r\nthis is done by washing it with diluted acetic, or sulphuric acid, which\r\ndissolves the impurities. No better test can be found for ascertaining if\r\nthe mercury be pure than that of filling a delicate thermometer tube; if,\r\non exhausting the air from this thermometer, the mercury will freely run\r\nup and down the bore, which is probably one thousandth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, the mercury from which this thermometer was made will be found\r\nfit for any purpose, and with it a tube may be filled and boiled, not only\r\nof one inch, but even of two inches diameter. In all barometers it is\r\nrequisite that the space above the mercurial column should be completely\r\nvoid of air and aqueous vapour, because these gases, by virtue of their\r\nelasticity, would depress the column. To exclude these the mercury is\r\nintroduced, and boiled in the tube, over a charcoal fire, kept up for the\r\npurpose. In this manner the air and vapour which adhere to the glass are\r\nexpanded, and escape away. One can tell whether a barometer has been\r\nproperly \"boiled,\" as it is termed, by simply holding the tube in a\r\nslanting direction and allowing the mercury to strike the top. If the\r\nboiling has been well performed, the mercury will give a clear, metallic\r\nsound; if not, a dull, flat sound, showing some air to be present.\r\n\r\nWhen the mercury in a barometer tube rises or falls, the level of the\r\nmercury in the cup, or _cistern_, as it is generally termed, falls or\r\nrises by a proportionate quantity, which depends upon the relative areas\r\nof the interior of the tube and of the cistern. It is necessary that this\r\nshould be taken into consideration in ascertaining the exact height of the\r\ncolumn. If a fixed scale is applied to the tube, the correct height may be\r\nobtained by applying a correction for capacity. A certain height of the\r\nmercury is ascertained to be accurately measured by the scale, and should\r\nbe marked on the instrument as the _neutral point_. Above this point the\r\nheights measured are all less, and below, all more, than they should be.\r\nThe ratio between the internal diameters of the tube and cistern (which\r\nshould also be stated on the instrument, as, for instance, capac. 1/50)\r\nsupplies the data for finding the correction to be applied. This\r\ncorrection is obviated by constructing the cistern so as to allow of the\r\nsurface of the mercury in it being adjustable to the commencement of the\r\nfixed scale, as by Fortin's or Negretti's plan. It is also unnecessary in\r\nbarometers constructed on what is now called the \"Kew method.\" These will\r\nall be detailed in their proper place. The tube, being fixed to the\r\ncistern, may have a moveable scale applied to it. But such an arrangement\r\nrequires the utmost care and skill in observing, and is seldom seen except\r\nin first-class Observatories.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n=3. Fortin's Barometer.=--Fortin's plan of constructing a barometer\r\ncistern is shown in fig. 2. The cistern is formed of a glass cylinder,\r\nwhich allows of the level of the mercury within being seen. The bottom of\r\nthe cylinder is made of sheep-skin or leather, like a bag, so as to allow\r\nof being pushed up or lowered by means of a screw, D B, worked from\r\nbeneath. This screw moves through the bottom of a brass cylinder, C C,\r\nwhich is fixed outside, and protects the glass cylinder containing the\r\nmercury. At the top of the interior of the cistern is fixed a small piece\r\nof ivory, A, the point of which exactly coincides with the zero of the\r\nscale. This screw and moveable cistern-bottom serve also to render the\r\nbarometer portable, by confining the mercury in the tube, and preventing\r\nits coming into the cistern, which is thus made too small to receive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. STANDARD BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 represents a Standard Barometer on Fortin's principle. The\r\nbarometer tube is enclosed and protected by a tube of brass extending\r\nthroughout its whole length; the upper portion of the brass tube has two\r\nlongitudinal openings opposite each other; on one side of the front\r\nopening is the barometrical scale of English inches, divided to show, by\r\nmeans of a vernier, 1/500th of an inch; on the opposite side is sometimes\r\ndivided a scale of French millimetres, reading also by a vernier to 1/10th\r\nof a millimetre (see directions for reading the vernier, page 7). A\r\nthermometer, C, is attached to the frame, and divided to degrees, which\r\ncan be read to tenths; it is necessary for ascertaining the temperature of\r\nthe instrument, in order to correct the observed height of the barometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nAs received by the observer, the barometer will consist of two parts,\r\npacked separately for safety in carriage,--1st, the barometer tube and\r\ncistern, filled with mercury, the brass tube, with its divided scale and\r\nthermometer; and 2nd, a mahogany board, with bracket at top, and brass\r\nring with three adjusting screws at bottom.\r\n\r\n_Directions for fixing the Barometer._--In selecting a position for a\r\nbarometer, care should be taken to place it so that the sun cannot shine\r\nupon it, and that it is not affected by direct heat from a fire. The\r\ncistern should be from two to three feet above the ground, which will give\r\na height for observing convenient to most persons. A standard barometer\r\nshould be compared with an observatory standard of acknowledged accuracy,\r\nto determine its index error; which, as such instruments are graduated by\r\nmicrometrical apparatus of great exactitude, will be constant for all\r\nparts of the scale. It should be capable of turning on its axis by a\r\nmovement of the hand, so that little difficulty can ever be experienced in\r\nobtaining a good light for observation. Having determined upon the\r\nposition in which to place the instrument, fix the mahogany board as\r\nnearly vertical as possible, and ascertain if the barometer is perfect and\r\nfree from air, in the following manner:--lower the screw at the bottom of\r\nthe cistern several turns, so that the mercury in the tube, when held\r\nupright, may fall two or three inches from the top; then slightly incline\r\nthe instrument from the vertical position, and if the mercury in striking\r\nthe top elicit a sharp tap, the instrument is perfect. Supposing the\r\nbarometer to be in perfect condition, as it is almost sure to be, it is\r\nnext suspended on the brass bracket, its cistern passing through the ring\r\nat bottom, and allowed to find its vertical position, after which it is\r\nfirmly clamped by means of the three thumb-screws.\r\n\r\n_To Remove the Instrument when fixed to another Position._--If it should\r\nbe necessary to remove the barometer,--first, by means of the adjusting\r\nscrew, drive the mercury to the top of the tube, turning it gently when it\r\nis approaching the top, and cease directly any resistance is experienced;\r\nnext, remove from the upper bracket or socket; lift the instrument and\r\ninvert it, carrying it with its lower end upwards.\r\n\r\n_Directions for taking an Observation._--Before making an observation, the\r\nmercury in the cistern must be raised or lowered by means of the\r\nthumb-screw, F, until the ivory point, E, and its reflected image in the\r\nmercury, D, are just in contact; the vernier is then moved by means of the\r\nmilled head, until its lower termination just excludes the light from the\r\ntop of the mercurial column; the reading is then taken by means of the\r\nscale on the limb and the vernier. The vernier should be made to read\r\nupward in all barometers, unless for a special object, as this arrangement\r\nadmits of the most exact setting. In observing, the eye should be placed\r\nin a right line with the fore and back edges of the lower termination of\r\nthe vernier; and this line should be made to form a tangent to the apex of\r\nthe mercurial column. A small reflector placed behind the vernier and\r\nmoving with it, so as to assist in throwing the light through the back\r\nslit of the brass frame on to the glass tube, is advantageous; and the\r\nobserver's vision may be further assisted by the aid of a reading lens.\r\nThe object is, in these Standard Barometers, to obtain an exact reading,\r\nwhich can only be done by having the eye, the fore part of the zero edge\r\nof the vernier, the top of the mercurial column, and the back of the\r\nvernier, in the same horizontal plane.\r\n\r\n_Uniformity of Calibre._--The diameter of that part of the tube through\r\nwhich the oscillations of the mercury will take place is very carefully\r\nexamined to insure uniformity of calibre, and only those tubes are used\r\nwhich are as nearly as possible of the same diameter throughout. The size\r\nof the bore should be marked on the frame of the barometer in tenths and\r\nhundredths of an inch. A correction due to capillary action, and depending\r\non the size of the tube, must be applied to the readings.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. Correction due to Capillarity.=--When an open tube of small bore is\r\nplunged into mercury, the fluid will not rise to the same level inside as\r\nit has outside. Hence, the effect of capillary action is to depress the\r\nmercurial column; and the more so the smaller the tube. The following\r\ntable gives the correction for tubes in ordinary use:--\r\n\r\n  Diameter     Depression, in     Depression, in\r\n  of tube.     boiled tubes.      unboiled tubes.\r\n   INCH.          INCH.               INCH.\r\n\r\n   0.60           0.002               0.004\r\n   0.55           0.003               0.005\r\n   0.50           0.003               0.007\r\n   0.45           0.005               0.010\r\n   0.40           0.007               0.015\r\n   0.35           0.010               0.021\r\n   0.15           0.044               0.029\r\n   0.10           0.070               0.041\r\n   0.30           0.014               0.058\r\n   0.25           0.020               0.086\r\n   0.20           0.029               0.140\r\n\r\nThis correction is always additive to the observed reading of the\r\nbarometer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=6. Correction due to Temperature.=--In all kinds of mercurial barometers\r\nattention must be given to the temperature of the mercury. As this metal\r\nexpands and contracts very much for variations of temperature, its density\r\nalters correspondingly, and in consequence the height of the barometric\r\ncolumn also varies. To ascertain the temperature of the mercury, a\r\nthermometer is placed near the tube, and is sometimes made to dip into the\r\nmercury in the cistern. The freezing point of water, 32 deg.F., is the\r\ntemperature to which all readings of barometers must be reduced, in order\r\nto make them fairly comparable. The reduction may be effected by\r\ncalculation, but the practical method is by tables for the purpose; and\r\nfor these tables we refer the reader to the works mentioned at the end of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\n\r\n=7. Correction due to Height above the Half-tide Level.=--Further, in\r\norder that barometrical observations generally may be made under similar\r\ncircumstances, the readings, corrected for capacity, capillarity, and\r\ntemperature, should be reduced to what they would be at the sea-level, by\r\nadding a correction corresponding to the height above the mean level of\r\nthe sea, or of half-tide. For practical purposes of comparison with\r\nbarometric pressure at other localities, add one-tenth of an inch to the\r\nreading for each hundred feet of elevation above the sea. For scientific\r\naccuracy this will not suffice, but a correction must be obtained by means\r\nof Schuckburg's formula, or tables computed therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n=8. The Barometer Vernier.=--The _vernier_, an invaluable contrivance for\r\nmeasuring small spaces, was invented by Peter Vernier, about the year\r\n1630. The barometer scale is divided into inches and tenths. The vernier\r\nenables us to accurately subdivide the tenths into hundredths, and, in\r\nfirst-class instruments, even to thousandths of an inch. It consists of a\r\nshort scale made to pass along the graduated fixed scale by a sliding\r\nmotion, or preferably by a rack-and-pinion motion, the vernier being fixed\r\non the rack, which is moved by turning the milled head of the pinion. The\r\nprinciple of the vernier, to whatever instrumental scale applied, is that\r\nthe divisions of the moveable scale are to those in an equal length of the\r\nfixed scale in the proportion of two numbers which differ from each other\r\nby unity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe scales of standard barometers are usually divided into half-tenths, or\r\n.05, of an inch, as represented, in fig. 5, by AB. The vernier, CD, is\r\nmade equal in length to twenty-four of these divisions, and divided into\r\ntwenty-five equal parts; consequently one space on the scale is larger\r\nthan one on the vernier by the twenty-fifth part of .05, which is .002\r\ninch, so that such a vernier shows differences of .002 inch. The vernier\r\nof the figure reading upwards, the lower edge, D, will denote the top of\r\nthe barometer column; and is the zero of the vernier scale. In fig. 4, the\r\nzero being in line exactly with 29 inches and five-tenths of the fixed\r\nscale, the barometer reading would be 29.500 inches. It will be seen that\r\nthe vernier line, _a_, falls short of a division of the scale by, as we\r\nhave explained, .002 inch; _b_, by .004; _c_, by .006; _d_, by .008; and\r\nthe next line by one hundredth. If, then, the vernier be moved so as to\r\nmake _a_ coincide with _z_, on the scale, it will have moved through .002\r\ninch; and if 1 on the vernier be moved into line with _y_ on the scale,\r\nthe space measured will be .010. Hence, the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on the\r\nvernier measure hundredths, and the intermediate lines even thousandths of\r\nan inch. In fig. 5, the zero of the vernier is intermediate 29.65 and\r\n29.70 on the scale. Passing the eye up the vernier and scale, the second\r\nline above 3 is perceived to lie evenly with a line of the scale. This\r\ngives .03 and .004 to add to 29.65, so that the actual reading is 29.684\r\ninches. It may happen that no line on the vernier _accurately_ lies in the\r\nsame straight line with one on the scale; in such a case a doubt will\r\narise as to the selection of one from two equally coincident, and the\r\nintermediate thousandth of an inch should be taken.\r\n\r\nFor the ordinary purposes of the barometer as a \"weather-glass,\" such\r\nminute measurement is not required. Hence, in household and marine\r\nbarometers the scale need only be divided to tenths, and the vernier\r\nconstructed to measure hundredths of an inch. This is done by making the\r\nvernier either 9 or 11-10ths of an inch long, and dividing it into ten\r\nequal parts. The lines above the zero line are then numbered from 1 to 10;\r\nsometimes the alternate divisions only are numbered, the intermediate\r\nnumbers being very readily inferred. Hence, if the first line of the\r\nvernier agrees with one on the scale, the next must be out one-tenth of a\r\ntenth, or .01 of an inch from agreement with the next _scale_ line; the\r\nfollowing vernier line must be .02 out, and so on. Consequently, when the\r\nvernier is set to the mercurial column, the difference shown by the\r\nvernier from the tenth on the scale is the hundredths to be added to the\r\ninches and tenths of the scale.\r\n\r\nA little practice will accustom a person to set and read any barometer\r\nquickly; an important matter where accuracy is required, as the heat of\r\nthe body, or the hand, is very rapidly communicated to the instrument, and\r\nmay vitiate, to some extent, the observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. SELF-COMPENSATING STANDARD BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nThis barometer has been suggested to Messrs. Negretti and Zambra by\r\nWentworth Erk, Esq. It consists of a regular barometer; but attached to\r\nthe vernier is a double rack worked with one pinion, so that in setting or\r\nadjusting the vernier in one position, the second rack moves in directly\r\nthe opposite direction, carrying along with it a plug or plunger the exact\r\nsize of the internal diameter of the tube dipping in the cistern, so that\r\nwhatever the displacement that has taken place in the cistern, owing to\r\nthe rise or fall of the mercury, it is exactly compensated by the plug\r\nbeing more or less immersed in the mercury, so that no capacity correction\r\nis required.\r\n\r\nA barometer on this principle is, however, no novelty, for at the Royal\r\nSociety's room a very old instrument may be seen reading somewhat after\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nFig. 6 is an illustration of the appearance of this instrument. The\r\ncistern is so constructed that the greatest amount of light is admitted to\r\nthe surface of the mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. BAROMETER WITH ELECTRICAL ADJUSTMENT.\r\n\r\nThis barometer is useful to persons whose eyesight may be defective; and\r\nis capable of being read off to greater accuracy than ordinary barometers,\r\nas will be seen by the following description:--The barometer consists of\r\nan upright tube dipping into a cistern, so contrived, that an up-and-down\r\nmovement, by means of a screw, can be imparted to it. In the top of the\r\ntube a piece of platina wire is hermetically sealed. The cistern also has\r\na metallic connection, so that by means of covered copper wires (in the\r\nback of the frame) a circuit is established; another connection also\r\nexists by means of a metallic point dipping into the cistern. The circuit,\r\nhowever, can be cut off from this by means of a switch placed about midway\r\nup the frame; on one side of the tube is placed a scale of inches; a small\r\ncircular vernier, divided into 100 parts, is connected with the dipping\r\npoint, and works at right angles with this scale.\r\n\r\nTo set the instrument in action for taking an observation, a small battery\r\nis connected by means of two small binding screws at the bottom of the\r\nframe. The switch is turned upwards, thereby disconnecting the dipping\r\npoint; the cistern is then screwed up, so that the mercury in the tube is\r\nbrought into contact with the platina wire at the top; the instant this is\r\neffected the magnetic needle seen on the barometer will be deflected. The\r\nswitch is now turned down; by so doing the connection with the upper wire\r\nor platina is cut off, and established instead only between the dipping\r\npoint carrying the circular vernier and the bottom of the cistern; the\r\npoint is now screwed by means of the milled head until the needle is again\r\ndeflected. We may now be sure that the line on the circular vernier that\r\ncuts the division on the scale is the exact height of the barometer.\r\nAlthough the description here given may seem somewhat lengthy, the\r\noperation itself is performed in less time than would be taken in reading\r\noff an ordinary instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. PEDIMENT BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nThese Barometers, generally for household purposes, are illustrated by\r\nfigs. 7 to 11. They are intended chiefly for \"weather glasses,\" and are\r\nmanufactured to serve not only a useful, but an ornamental purpose as\r\nwell. They are usually framed in wood, such as mahogany, rosewood, ebony,\r\noak or walnut, and can be obtained either plain or handsomely and\r\nelaborately carved and embellished, in a variety of designs, so as to be\r\nsuitable for private rooms, large halls, or public buildings. The scales\r\nto the barometer and its attached thermometer may be ivory, porcelain, or\r\nsilvered metal. It is not desirable that the vernier should read nearer\r\nthan one-hundredth of an inch. Two verniers and scales may be fitted one\r\non either side of the mercurial column, so that one can denote the last\r\nreading, and thus show at a glance the extent of rise or fall in the\r\ninterval. The scale and thermometer should be covered with plate glass. A\r\ncheap instrument has an open face and plain frame, with sliding vernier\r\ninstead of rack-and-pinion motion. The barometer may or may not have a\r\nmoveable bottom to the cistern, with screw for the purpose of securing the\r\nmercury for portability. The cistern should not, however, require\r\nadjustment to a zero or fiducial point. It should be large enough to\r\ncontain the mercury, which falls from 31 to 27 inches, without any\r\nappreciable error on the height read off on the scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n=12. The Words on the Scale.=--The following words are usually engraved on\r\nthe scales of these barometers, although they are not now considered of so\r\nmuch importance as formerly:--\r\n\r\n  At 31  inches         Very dry.\r\n  \"  30.5  \"            Settled fair.\r\n  \"  30    \"            Fair.\r\n  \"  29.5  \"            Changeable.\r\n  \"  29    \"            Rain.\r\n  \"  28.5  \"            Much rain.\r\n  \"  28    \"            Stormy.\r\n\r\nThe French place upon their barometers a similar formula:--\r\n\r\n  At 785 millimetres    Tres-sec.\r\n  \"  776      \"         Beau-fixe.\r\n  \"  767      \"         Beau temps.\r\n  \"  758      \"         Variable.\r\n  \"  749      \"         Pluie ou vent.\r\n  \"  740      \"         Grande pluie.\r\n  \"  731      \"         Tempete.\r\n\r\nManufacturers of barometers have uniformly adopted these indications for\r\nall countries, without regard to the elevation above the sea, or the\r\ndifferent geographical conditions; and as it can readily be shown that the\r\nheight and variations of the barometer are dependent on these, it follows\r\nthat barometers have furnished indications which, under many\r\ncircumstances, have been completely false. Even in this country, and near\r\nthe sea-level, storms are frequent with the barometer not below 29; rain\r\nis not uncommon with the glass at 30; even fine weather sometimes occurs\r\nwith a low pressure; while it is evident that at an elevation of a few\r\nthousand feet the mercury would never rise to 30 inches; hence, according\r\nto the scale, there should never be fair weather there. If tempests\r\nhappened as seldom in our latitude as the barometer gets down to 28\r\ninches, the maritime portion of the community at least would be happy\r\nindeed. These words have long been ridiculed by persons acquainted with\r\nthe causes of the barometric fluctuations; nevertheless opticians continue\r\nto place them on the scales, evidently only because they appear to add to\r\nthe importance of the instrument in the eyes of those who have not learned\r\ntheir general inutility. In different regions of the world, the\r\nindications of the barometer are modified by the conditions peculiar to\r\nthe geographical position and elevation above the sea, and it is necessary\r\nto take account of these in any attempt to found rules of general utility\r\nin connection with the barometer as a weather guide. All that can be said\r\nin favour of these words is, that within a few hundred feet of the\r\nsea-level, when the column rises or falls gradually during two or three\r\ndays towards \"Fair\" or \"Rain,\" the indications they afford of the coming\r\nweather are generally extremely probable; but when the variations are\r\nquick, upward or downward, they presage unsettled or stormy weather.\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy writes:--\"The words on the scales of barometers should not\r\nbe so much regarded, for weather indications, as the rising or falling of\r\nthe mercury; for if it stands at _Changeable_, and then rises a little\r\ntowards _Fair_, it presages a change of wind or weather, though not so\r\ngreat as if the mercury had risen higher; and, on the contrary, if the\r\nmercury stands above _Fair_ and falls, it presages a change, though not to\r\nso great a degree as if it had stood lower; besides which, the direction\r\nand force of wind are not in any way noticed. It is not from the point at\r\nwhich the mercury stands that we are alone to form a judgment of the state\r\nof the weather, but from its _rising_ or _falling_; and from the movements\r\nof immediately preceding days as well as hours, keeping in mind effects of\r\nchange of _direction_ and dryness, or moisture, as well as alteration of\r\nforce or strength of wind.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n=13. Correction due to Capacity of Cistern.=--These barometers, having no\r\nadjustment for the zero of the scale, require a correction for the varying\r\nlevel of the mercury in the cistern, when the observations are required\r\nfor strict comparison with other barometric observations, or when they are\r\nregistered for scientific purposes; but for the common purpose of\r\npredicting the weather, this correction is unnecessary. The neutral point,\r\nand the ratio of the bore of the tube to the diameter of the cistern, must\r\nbe known (see p. 3). Then the capacity correction, as it is termed, is\r\nfound as follows:--Take the fractional part, expressed by the capacity\r\nratio, of the difference between the observed reading and the height of\r\nthe neutral point; then, if the mercury stand _below_ the neutral point,\r\n_subtract_ this result from the reading; if it stand _above_, _add_ it to\r\nthe reading.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose the neutral point to be 29.95 inches, and the\r\ncapacity ratio 1/50, required the correction when the barometer reads\r\n30.78.\r\n\r\n  Here                  30.78 - 29.95 = 0.83\r\n  Correction                = 0.83/50 = +0.02 nearly.\r\n  Scale reading                         30.78\r\n                                        -----\r\n  Correct reading                       30.80\r\n                                        =====\r\n\r\nOf course the correction could as easily be found to three decimal places,\r\nif desirable. It is evident that the correction is more important the\r\ngreater the distance of the top of the mercury from the neutral point.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. PUBLIC BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\nSince the increased attention paid to the signs of forthcoming weather of\r\nlate years, and the good which has resulted therefrom to farmers,\r\ngardeners, civil engineers, miners, fishermen, and mariners generally, by\r\nforewarning of impending wet or stormy weather, the desirability of having\r\ngood barometers exposed in public localities has become evident.\r\n\r\nBarometers may now be seen attached to drinking fountains, properly\r\nprotected, and are frequently consulted by the passers-by. But it is among\r\nthose whose lives are endangered by sudden changes in the weather,\r\nfishermen especially, that the warning monitor is most urgently required.\r\nMany poor fishing villages and towns have therefore been provided by the\r\nBoard of Trade, at the public expense, and through the humane effort of\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy, with first-class barometers, each fixed in a conspicuous\r\nposition, so as to be easily accessible to all who desire to consult it.\r\nFollowing this example, the Royal National Life Boat Institution has\r\nsupplied each of its stations with a similar storm warner; the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland and the British Meteorological Society have erected several\r\non the coast of Northumberland; and many other individuals have presented\r\nbarometers to maritime places with which they are connected.\r\n\r\nThese barometers have all been manufactured by Messrs. Negretti and\r\nZambra. The form given to the instrument seems well adapted for public\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\n=15. Fishery or Sea-coast Barometers.=--Fig. 12 gives a representation of\r\nthese coast and fishery barometers. The frame is of solid oak, firmly\r\nscrewed together. The scales are very legibly engraved on porcelain by\r\nNegretti and Zambra's patent process. The thermometer is large, and easily\r\nread; and as this instrument is exposed, it will indicate the actual\r\ntemperature sufficiently for practical purposes. The barometer tube is\r\nthree-tenths of an inch in diameter of bore, exhibiting a good column of\r\nmercury; and the cistern is of such capacity, in relation to the tube,\r\nthat the change of height in the surface of the mercury in the cistern\r\ncorresponding to a change of height of three inches of mercury in the\r\ntube, is less than one-hundredth of an inch, and therefore, as the\r\nreadings are only to be made to this degree of accuracy, this small error\r\nis of no importance. The cistern is made of boxwood, which is sufficiently\r\nporous to allow the atmosphere to influence the mercurial column; but the\r\ntop is plugged with porous cane, to admit of free and certain play.\r\n\r\n\r\n=16. Admiral FitzRoy's Scale Words.=--The directions given on the scales\r\nof these barometers were drawn up by Admiral FitzRoy, F.R.S. They appear\r\nto be founded on the following considerations:--\r\n\r\nSupposing a compass diagram, with the principal points laid down, the N.E.\r\nis the wind for which the barometer stands highest; for the S.W. wind it\r\nis lowest. This is found to be so in the great majority of cases; but\r\nthere are exceptions to this, as to all rules. The N.E. and S.W. may\r\ntherefore be regarded as the poles of the winds, being opposite each\r\nother. When the wind veers from the S.W. through W. and N. to N.E., the\r\nbarometer gradually rises; on the contrary, when the wind veers from N.E.\r\nand E. to S.E., S. and S.W., the mercury falls. A similar curious law\r\nexists in relation to the veering of the wind, and the action of the\r\nthermometer. As the wind veers from the S.W. to W. and N., the thermometer\r\nfalls; as it veers from N.E. to E. and S., it rises, because the wind gets\r\nfrom a colder to a warmer quarter. The polar winds are cold, dry, and\r\nheavy. Those from the equatorial regions are warm, moist, and\r\ncomparatively light.\r\n\r\nThese laws have been clearly developed and expressed by Professor Dove in\r\nhis work on the \"Law of Storms.\" The warm winds of Europe are those which\r\nbring the greatest quantity of rain, as they blow from the ocean, and come\r\nheavily laden with moisture. The cold winds, besides containing less\r\nmoisture, blow more from the land. The weight of the vapour of the warm\r\nwinds tends to raise the barometric column; but, at the same time, the\r\nincreased dilatation of the air tends to lower it. This latter influence\r\nbeing the stronger, the barometer always falls for these winds; and in\r\nregions where they traverse a large extent of land, retain their heat, and\r\nbecome necessarily very dry, the fall in the barometer will be greater.\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy's words for the scales of barometers for use in northern\r\nlatitudes, then, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _RISE._                      _FALL._\r\n      FOR                          FOR\r\n    N. ELY.                      S. WLY.\r\n  NW.--N.--E.

WIND.\r\n   -------                      -------\r\n    EXCEPT                       EXCEPT\r\n   WET FROM                     WET FROM\r\n    N. ED.                       N. ED.\r\n   -------                      -------\r\n  Long foretold, long last;    First rise after low,\r\n  Short notice, soon past.     Foretells stronger blow.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that the exception in each case applies to N.E.\r\nwinds. The barometer may fall with north-easterly winds, but they will be\r\nviolent and accompanied with rain, hail, or snow; again, it will rise with\r\nthese winds accompanied with rain, when they are light, and bring only\r\nlittle rain. It rises, however, highest with the dry and light N.E. winds.\r\n\r\nThese directions are very practically useful; they provide for\r\ngeographical position--also for elevation above the sea--since they are\r\nnot appended to any particular height of the column. They are suited to\r\nthe northern hemisphere generally, as well as around the British Isles.\r\nThe same directions are adapted to the southern hemisphere, by simply\r\nsubstituting for the letter N the letter S, reading south for north, and\r\n_vice versa_. South of the equator the cold winds come from the south; the\r\nwarm, from the north. The S.E. wind in the southern hemisphere corresponds\r\nto the N.E. in the northern. The laws there are, while the wind veers from\r\nS.E. through E. to N. and N.W., the barometer falls and the thermometer\r\nrises. As the wind veers from N.W. through W. and S. to S.E., the\r\nbarometer rises and the thermometer falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n=17. Instructions for the Sea-coast Barometer.=--The directions for fixing\r\nthe barometer, and making it portable when it has to be removed, should be\r\nattended to carefully. The barometer should be suspended against a frame\r\nor piece of wood, so that light may be seen _through_ the tube. Otherwise\r\na piece of paper, or a _white place_, should be behind the upper or _scale\r\npart_ of the _tube_.\r\n\r\nWhen suspended on a hook, or stout nail, apply the milled-head key (which\r\nwill be found just below the scales) to the square brass pin at the lower\r\nend of the instrument, and turn _gently_ toward the left hand till the\r\nscrew stops; then take off the key and replace it for use, near the scale,\r\nas it was before. The cistern bottom being thus _let down_, the mercury\r\nwill sink to its proper level quickly.\r\n\r\nIn removing this barometer it is necessary to _slope it gradually_, till\r\nthe mercury is at the top of the tube, and then, with the instrument\r\nreversed, to screw up the cistern bottom, or bag, by the key, used\r\n_gently_, till it stops. It will then be portable, and may be carried with\r\nthe _cistern_ end _upwards_, or lying flat; but it must not be jarred, or\r\nreceive a concussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=18. French Sea-coast Barometer.=--The French have imitated this form of\r\nbarometer for coast service, and have translated Admiral FitzRoy's\r\nindications for the scale as follows:--\r\n\r\n          LA                            LA\r\n        HAUSSE                        BAISSE\r\n       INDIQUE.

The Common Form.=--The barometer is of great use to the mariner, who,\r\nby using it as a \"weather glass,\" is enabled to foresee and prepare for\r\nsudden changes in the weather. For marine purposes, the lower portion of\r\nthe glass tube of the barometer must be contracted to a fine bore, to\r\nprevent oscillation in the mercurial column, which would otherwise be\r\noccasioned by the movements of the ship. This tube is cemented to the\r\ncistern, which is made of boxwood, and has a moveable leathern bottom, for\r\nthe purpose of rendering the instrument portable, by screwing up the\r\nmercury compactly in the tube. The tube is enclosed in a mahogany frame,\r\nwhich admits of a variety of style in shape, finish, and display, to meet\r\nthe different fancies and means of purchasers. The frame is generally\r\nenlarged at the upper part to receive the scales and the attached\r\nthermometer, which are covered by plate glass. The cistern is encased in\r\nbrass for protection, the bottom portion unscrewing to give access to the\r\nportable screw beneath the cistern. Figs. 13 and 14 illustrate this form\r\nof barometer. Marine barometers require to be suspended, so that they may\r\nremain in a vertical position under the changeable positions of a vessel\r\nat sea. To effect this they are suspended in gimbals by a brass arm. The\r\ngimbals consist of a loose ring fastened by thumb-screws to the middle\r\npart of the frame of the barometer, in front and back. The forked end of\r\nthe arm supports this ring at the sides, also by the aid of thumb-screws.\r\nHence the superior weight of the cistern end is always sufficient to cause\r\nthe instrument to move on its bearing screws, so as always to maintain a\r\nperpendicular position; in fact, it is so delicately held that it yields\r\nto the slightest disturbance in any direction. The other end of the arm is\r\nattached to a stout plate, having holes for screws, or fitted to slip into\r\na staple or bracket, by which it may be fixed to any part of the cabin of\r\na ship; the arm is hinged to the plate, for the purpose of turning the arm\r\nand barometer up whenever it is desirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nOther forms of barometer (to be immediately described) have superseded\r\nthis in the British Marine, but the French still give the preference to\r\nthe wooden frames. They think the barometer can be more securely mounted\r\nin wood, is more portable, and less liable to be broken by a sudden\r\nconcussion than if fitted in a metal frame. The English deem the ordinary\r\nwooden barometers not sufficiently accurate, owing to the irregular\r\nexpansion of wood, arising from its hygrometric properties. Some of the\r\nEnglish opticians have shown that very portable, and really accurate\r\nbarometers can be made in brass frames, and therefore the preference is\r\nnow given to this latter material.\r\n\r\n\r\n=20. The Kew Marine Barometer.=--The form of barometer so-called, is that\r\nrecommended by the Congress of Brussels, held in 1853, for the purpose of\r\ndevising a systematic plan of promoting meteorological observations at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe materials employed in its construction are mercury, glass, iron, and\r\nbrass. The upper part of the tube is carefully calibrated to ensure\r\nuniformity of bore, as this is a point upon which the accuracy of the\r\ninstrument to some extent depends. At sea, the barometer has never been\r\nknown to stand above 31 inches, nor below 27. These extremes have been\r\nattained with instruments of undoubted accuracy, but they are quite\r\nexceptional. It is not necessary, therefore, to carry the scales of marine\r\nbarometers beyond these limits, but they should not be made shorter. If\r\nthe vernier is adjusted to read upward, the scale should extend to 32\r\ninches, to allow room for the vernier to be set to 31 inches at least.\r\nCases have occurred in which this could not be done, and rare, but\r\nvaluable observations have been lost in consequence. If the scale part of\r\nthe tube be not uniform in bore, the index error will be irregular\r\nthroughout the scale. Whether the bore of the rest of the tube varies in\r\ndiameter, is of no moment. From two to three inches below the measured\r\npart, the bore is contracted very much, to prevent the pulsations in the\r\nmercurial column--called \"pumping\"--which, otherwise, would occur at sea\r\nfrom the motion of the ship. In ordinary marine barometers, this\r\ncontraction extends to the end of the tube. Below the contracted part is\r\ninserted a pipette--or Gay Lussac air-trap--which is a little elongated\r\nfunnel with the point downwards. Its object is to arrest any air that may\r\nwork in between the glass and the mercury. The bubble of air lodges at the\r\nshoulder, and can go up no farther. It is one of those simple contrivances\r\nwhich turn out remarkably useful. If any air gets into the tube, it does\r\nnot get to the top, and therefore does not vitiate the performance of the\r\nbarometer; for the mercury itself works up and down through the funnel.\r\nBelow this, the tube should not be unnecessarily contracted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe open end of the tube is fixed into an iron cylinder, which forms the\r\ncistern of the barometer. Iron has no action upon mercury, and is\r\ntherefore used instead of any other metal. One or two holes are made in\r\nthe top of the cistern, which are covered on the inside with strong\r\nsheep-skin leather, so as to be impervious to mercury, but sufficiently\r\nporous for the outer air to act upon the column. The cistern is of\r\ncapacity sufficient to receive the mercury which falls out of the tube\r\nuntil the column stands lower than the scale reads; and when the tube is\r\ncompletely full, there is enough mercury to cover the extremity so as to\r\nprevent access of air. There is no screw required for screwing up the\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\nThe glass tube thus secured to the cistern is protected by a brass tubular\r\nframe, into which the iron cistern fits and screws compactly. Cork is used\r\nto form bearings for the tube. A few inches above the cistern is placed\r\nthe attached thermometer. Its bulb is enclosed in the frame, so as to be\r\nequally affected by heat with the barometric column. The upper end of the\r\nframe is fitted with a cap which screws on, and embraces a glass shield\r\nwhich rests in a gallery formed on the frame below the scale, and serves\r\nto protect the silvered scale, as well as the inner tube, from dust and\r\ndamp. A ring, moveable in a collar fixed on the frame above the centre of\r\ngravity of the instrument, is attached to gimbals, and the whole is\r\nsupported by a brass arm in the usual manner; so that the instrument can\r\nbe moved round its axis to bring any source of light upon it, and will\r\nremain vertical in all positions of the ship. The vernier reads to\r\nfive-hundredths of an inch. No words are placed upon the scale, as the old\r\nformulary was deemed misleading. The vernier can be set with great\r\nexactness, as light is admitted to the top of the mercury by a front and\r\na back slit in the frame. The lower edge of the vernier should be brought\r\nto the top of the mercury, so as just to shut out the light.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this form of barometer must be more reliable in its\r\nindications than those in wooden frames. The graduations can be accurately\r\nmade, and they will be affected only by well-known alterations due to\r\ntemperature. Some think the tube is too firmly held, and therefore liable\r\nto be broken by concussion more readily than that of an inferior\r\ninstrument. This, however, appears a necessary consequence of greater\r\nexactness. It is an exceedingly good portable instrument, and can be put\r\nup and taken down very readily. These barometers are preferred to marine\r\nbarometers in wood, wherever they have been used. In merchant ships, and\r\nunder careful treatment, they have been found very durable. They may be\r\nsent with safety by railway, packed carefully in a wooden box.\r\n\r\n_Directions for Packing._--In removing this barometer it is necessary to\r\nslope it gradually till the mercury reaches the top of the tube. It is\r\nthen portable, if carried cistern end upwards or lying flat. If carried\r\notherwise, it will very probably be broken by the jerking motion of the\r\nheavy mercury in the glass tube. Of course it must not be jarred, or\r\nreceive concussion.\r\n\r\n_Position for Marine Barometer._--Admiral FitzRoy, to whose valuable\r\npapers we are much indebted, writes in his \"Barometer Manual\":--\"It is\r\ndesirable to place the barometer in such a position as not to be in danger\r\nof a side blow, and also sufficiently far from the deck above to allow for\r\nthe spring of the metal arm in cases of sudden movements of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"If there is risk of the instrument striking anywhere when the vessel is\r\nmuch heeled, it will be desirable to put some soft padding on that place,\r\nor to check movement in that direction by a light elastic cord; in fixing\r\nwhich, attention must be paid to have it acting only where risk of a blow\r\nbegins, not interfering otherwise with the free swing of the instrument: a\r\nvery light cord attached above, when possible, will be least likely to\r\ninterfere injuriously.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=21. Method of verifying Marine and other Barometers.=--\"In nearly all the\r\nbarometers which had been employed at sea till recently the index\r\ncorrection varied through the range of scale readings, in proportion to\r\nthe difference of capacity between the cistern and the tube. To find the\r\nindex correction for a land barometer, comparison with a standard, at any\r\npart of the scale at which the mercury may happen to be, is generally\r\nconsidered sufficient. To test the marine barometer is a work of much more\r\ntime, since it is necessary to find the correction for scale readings at\r\nabout each half inch throughout the range of atmospheric pressure to which\r\nit may be exposed; and it becomes necessary to have recourse to artificial\r\nmeans of changing the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the\r\nmercury in the cistern.\r\n\r\n\"The barometers to be thus tested are placed, together with a standard, in\r\nan air-tight chamber, to which an air-pump is applied, so that, by\r\npartially exhausting the air, the standard can be made to read much lower\r\nthan the lowest pressure to which marine barometers are likely to be\r\nexposed; and by compressing the air it can be made to read higher than the\r\nmercury ever stands at the level of the sea. The tube of the standard is\r\ncontracted similarly to that of the marine barometer, but a provision is\r\nmade for adjusting the mercury in its cistern to the zero point. Glass\r\nwindows are inserted in the upper part of the iron air-chamber, through\r\nwhich the scales of the barometers may be seen; but as the verniers cannot\r\nbe moved in the usual way from outside the chamber, a provision is made\r\nfor reading the height of the mercury independent of the verniers attached\r\nto the scales of the respective barometers. At a distance of some five or\r\nsix feet from the air-tight chamber a vertical scale is fixed. The\r\ndivisions on this scale correspond exactly with those on the tube of the\r\nstandard barometer. A vernier and telescope are made to slide on the scale\r\nby means of a rack and pinion. The telescope has two horizontal wires, one\r\nfixed and the other moveable by a micrometer screw, so that the difference\r\nbetween the height of the column of mercury and the nearest division on\r\nthe scale of the standard, and also of all the other barometers placed by\r\nthe side of it for comparison, can be measured either with the vertical\r\nscale and vernier or the micrometer wire. The means are thus possessed of\r\ntesting barometers for index error in any part of the scale, through the\r\nwhole range of atmospheric pressure to which they are likely to be\r\nexposed; and the usual practice is to test them at every half inch from\r\n27.5 to 31 inches.\r\n\r\n\"In this way barometers of various other descriptions have been tested,\r\nand some errors found to be so large that a few barometers read half an\r\ninch and upwards too high, while others read as much too low. In some\r\ncases those which were correct in one part of the scale were found to be\r\nfrom half an inch to an inch wrong in other parts. These barometers were\r\nof an old and ordinary, not to say inferior, construction. In some the\r\nmercury would not descend lower than about 29 inches, owing to a fault\r\nvery general in the construction of many common barometers till lately in\r\nfrequent use:--the _cistern was not large enough_ to hold the mercury\r\nwhich descended from the tube in a _low atmospheric pressure_.\r\n\r\n\"When used on shore, this contraction of the tube causes the marine\r\nbarometer to be _sometimes_ a little behind an ordinary land barometer,\r\nthe tube of which is not contracted. The amount varies according to the\r\nrate at which the mercury is rising or falling, and ranges from 0.00 to\r\n0.02 of an inch. As the motion of the ship at sea causes the mercury to\r\npass more rapidly through the contracted tube, the readings are almost the\r\nsame there as they would be if the tube were not contracted, and in no\r\ncase do they differ enough to be of importance in maritime use.\"\r\n\r\nThe cistern of this marine barometer is generally made an inch and a\r\nquarter in diameter, and the scale part of the tube a quarter of an inch\r\nin bore. The inches on the scale, instead of being true, are shortened by\r\n.04 of an inch, in order to avoid the necessity of applying a correction\r\ndue to the difference of capacity of the tube and cistern. This is done\r\nwith much perfection, and the errors of the instruments, when compared\r\nwith a standard by the apparatus used at Kew and Liverpool Observatories,\r\nare determined to the thousandth of an inch, and are invariably very\r\nuniform and small. The error so determined includes the correction due to\r\ncapillarity, capacity, and error of graduation, and forms a constant\r\ncorrection, so that only one variable correction, that due to temperature,\r\nneed be applied, when the barometer is suspended near the water line of\r\nthe ship, to make the observations comparable with others. With all the\r\nadvantages of this barometer, however, it has recently been superseded, to\r\nsome extent, because it was found to require more care than could\r\nordinarily be expected to be given to it by the commander of a ship.\r\nSeamen do not exactly understand the value of such nice accuracy as the\r\nthousandth part of an inch, but prefer an instrument that reads only to a\r\nhundredth part.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. THE FITZROY MARINE BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy deemed it desirable to construct a form of barometer as\r\npractically useful as possible for marine purposes. One that should be\r\nless delicate in structure than the Kew barometer, and not so finely\r\ngraduated. One that could be set at a glance and read easily; that would\r\nbe more likely to bear the common shocks unavoidable in a ship of war.\r\nAccordingly, the Admiral has devised a barometer, which he has thus\r\ndescribed:--\r\n\r\n\"This marine barometer, for Her Majesty's service, is adapted to _general_\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\"It differs from barometers hitherto made in points of detail, rather than\r\nprinciple:--1. The glass tube is packed with vulcanised india-rubber,\r\nwhich checks vibration from concussion; but does not hold it rigidly, or\r\nprevent expansion. 2. It does not oscillate (or pump), though extremely\r\nsensitive. 3. The scale is porcelain, _very legible_, and not liable to\r\nchange. 4. There is no iron anywhere (_to rust_). 5. Every part can be\r\nunscrewed, examined, or cleaned, by any careful person. 6. There is a\r\n_spare_ tube, fixed in a cistern, filled with boiled mercury, and _marked_\r\nfor adjustment in this, or _any similar_ instrument.\r\n\r\n\"These barometers are graduated to hundredths, and they will be found\r\naccurate to _that_ degree, namely the second decimal of an inch.\r\n\r\n\"They are packed with vulcanised caoutchouc, in order that (by this, and\r\nby a peculiar strength of glass tube) guns may be fired near these\r\ninstruments without causing injury to them by ordinary concussion.\r\n\r\n\"It is hoped that all such instruments, for the public service at sea,\r\nwill be quite similar, so that any spare tube will fit _any_ barometer.\r\n\r\n\"_To Shift a Tube._--Incline the barometer slowly, and then take it down,\r\nafter allowing the mercury to fill the upper part. Lay the instrument on a\r\ntable, unscrew the outer cap at the joining just below the cistern swell,\r\nthen unscrew the tube _and_ cistern, by turning the cistern gently,\r\nagainst the sun, or to _the left_, and draw out the tube very carefully\r\n_without bending it in the least_, _turning_ it a little, if required, as\r\nmoved. Then insert the new tube very cautiously, screw in, and adjust to\r\nthe diamond-cut mark for 27 inches. Attach the cap, and suspend the\r\nbarometer for use.\r\n\r\n\"If the mercury does not immediately quit the top of the tube, tap the\r\ncistern end rather sharply. In a well-boiled tube, with a good vacuum, the\r\nmercury hangs, at times, so adhesively as to deceive, by causing a\r\nsupposition of some defect.\r\n\r\n\"In about ten minutes the mercurial column should be nearly right; but as\r\nlocal temperature affects the brass, as well as the mercury, slowly and\r\nunequally, it may be well to defer any _exact comparisons with other\r\ninstruments_ for some few hours.\"\r\n\r\nMessrs. Negretti and Zambra are the makers of these barometers for the\r\nRoyal Navy. Fig. 16 is an illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe tube is fixed to a boxwood cistern, which is plugged with very porous\r\ncane at the top, to allow of the ready influence of a variation in\r\natmospheric pressure upon the mercury. Round the neck of the cistern is\r\nformed a brass ring, with a screw thread on its circumference. This screws\r\ninto the frame, and a mark on the tube is to be adjusted to 27 inches on\r\nthe scale, the cistern covering screwed on, and the instrument is ready to\r\nsuspend. The frame and all the fittings are brass, without any iron\r\nwhatever; because the contact of the two metals produces a galvanic\r\naction, which is objectionable. The spare tube is fitted with\r\nindia-rubber, and ready at any time to replace the one in the frame. The\r\nease with which a tube can be replaced when broken is an excellent feature\r\nof the instrument. The spare tube is carefully stowed in a box, which can\r\nalso receive the complete instrument when not in use. All the parts are\r\nmade to a definite gauge; the frames are, therefore, all as nearly as\r\npossible similar to each other, and the tubes--like rifle bullets--are\r\nadjustible to any frame. If, then, the tube in use gets broken, the\r\ncaptain can replace it by the other; but, as it is securely packed with\r\nindia-rubber, there is very little liability of its being broken by fair\r\nusage. Every person who knows the importance of the barometer on board\r\nship, will acknowledge that the supplementary tube is a decided\r\nimprovement. Many instruments of this description are afloat in the Royal\r\nNavy, and in a short time it may be expected that all the frames and tubes\r\nof barometers in the public service at sea will be similar in size and\r\ncharacter; so that should a captain have the misfortune to get both his\r\ntubes broken, he would be able to borrow another from any ship he fell in\r\nwith that had one to spare, which would be perfectly accurate, because it\r\nwould have been verified before it was sent out.\r\n\r\n\r\n=23. Admiral FitzRoy's Words for the Scale.=--The graduation of inches and\r\ndecimals are placed in this barometer on the right-hand side of the tube;\r\nand on a similar piece of porcelain, on the left-hand, are engraved, as\r\nlegibly as they are expressed succinctly, the following words, of\r\nuniversal application in the interpretation of the barometer movements:--\r\n\r\n     _RISE_            _FALL_\r\n      FOR               FOR\r\n      COLD              WARM\r\n      DRY               WET\r\n       OR                OR\r\n      LESS              MORE\r\n      WIND.             WIND.\r\n    --------          --------\r\n     EXCEPT            EXCEPT\r\n    WET FROM          WET FROM\r\n   COOLER SIDE.      COOLER SIDE.\r\n\r\nReverting to the explanation of the words on the \"Coast\" barometers (at\r\npage 14), and comparing and considering them as given for northern\r\nlatitudes, and as they must be altered for southern latitudes, it will be\r\nperceived, that for all _cold_ winds the barometer rises; and falls for\r\n_warm_ winds. The mercury also falls for _increased_ strength of wind; and\r\nrises as the wind _lulls_. Likewise before or with rain the column of\r\nmercury falls; but it rises with fine dry weather. Putting these facts\r\ntogether, and substituting for the points of the compass the terms \"cold\"\r\nand \"warm,\" the appropriateness of the words on the scale of this\r\nbarometer is readily perceived. These concise and practical indications of\r\nthe movements in the barometer are applicable for instruments intended for\r\nuse in any region of the world, and are in perfect accordance with the\r\nlaws of winds and weather deduced by Dove and other meteorologists. There\r\nis nothing objectionable in them, and being founded upon experience and\r\nthe deductions made from numerous recorded observations of the weather in\r\nall parts of the world, as well as confirmed by the theories of science,\r\nthey may consequently be considered as generally reliable. They involve no\r\nconjecture, but express succinctly scientific principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n=24. Trials of the FitzRoy Marine Barometer under Fire of Guns.=--Some of\r\nthe first barometers made by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra on Admiral\r\nFitzRoy's principle were severely tried under the heaviest naval gun\r\nfiring, on board H.M.S. _Excellent_; and under all the circumstances, they\r\nwithstood the concussion. The purpose of the trials was \"to ascertain\r\nwhether the _vulcanized india-rubber packing_ round the glass tube of a\r\n_new marine barometer_ did check the vibration caused by firing, and\r\nwhether guns might be fired close to these instruments without causing\r\ninjury to them.\" In the first and second series of experiments, a marine\r\nbarometer on Admiral FitzRoy's plan was tried against a marine barometer\r\non the Kew principle, both instruments being new, and treated in all\r\nrespects similarly. They were \"hung over the gun, under the gun, and by\r\nthe side of the gun, the latter both inside and outside a bulkhead,--in\r\nfact, in all ways that they would be tried in action with the bulkheads\r\ncleared away.\" The result was that the Kew barometer was broken and\r\nrendered useless, while the new pattern barometer was not injured in the\r\nleast. In a third series of experiments, Mr. Negretti being present, five\r\nof the new pattern barometers were subjected to the concussion produced by\r\nfiring a 68-pounder gun with shot, and 16 lbs. charge of powder. They were\r\nsuspended from a beam immediately under the gun, then from a beam\r\nimmediately over the gun, and finally they were suspended by the arm to a\r\nbulkhead, at a distance of only 3 ft. 6 in. from the axis of the gun; and\r\nthe result was, according to the official report, \"that all these\r\nbarometers, however suspended, would stand, without the slightest injury,\r\nthe most severe concussion that they would ever be likely to experience in\r\nany sea-going man-of-war.\" These trials were conducted under the\r\nsuperintendence of Captain Hewlett, C.B., and the guns were fired in the\r\ncourse of his _usual_ instructions. His reports to Admiral FitzRoy, giving\r\nall the particulars of the trials, are published in the \"Ninth Number of\r\nMeteorological Papers,\" issued by the Board of Trade.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. NEGRETTI AND ZAMBRA'S FARMER'S BAROMETER AND DOMESTIC WEATHER-GLASS.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the barometer is as much, or even more\r\naffected by a change of wind as it is by rain; and the objection raised\r\nagainst a simple barometer reading, as leaving the observer in doubt\r\nwhether to expect wind or rain, is removed by the addition of the\r\nHygrometer, an instrument indicating the comparative degree of dryness or\r\ndampness of the air;--a most important item in the determination of the\r\ncoming weather.\r\n\r\nThe farmer should not be content to let his crops lie at the mercy, so to\r\nspeak, of the weather, when he has within his command instruments which\r\nmay be the means of preventing damage to, and in cases total loss of, his\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThe farmer hitherto has had to depend for his prognostication of the\r\nweather on his own unassisted \"Weather Wisdom;\" and it is perfectly\r\nmarvellous how expert he has become in its use. Science now steps in, not\r\nto ignore this experience, but on the contrary, to give it most valuable\r\nassistance by extending it, and enabling it to predict, with an accuracy\r\nhitherto unknown, the various changes that take place in this most\r\nvariable of climates.\r\n\r\nTo the invalid, the importance of predicting with tolerable accuracy the\r\nchanges that are likely to occur in the weather, cannot be over-rated.\r\nMany colds would be prevented, if we could know that the morning so balmy\r\nand bright, would subside into a cold and cheerless afternoon. Even to the\r\nrobust, much inconvenience may be prevented by a due respect to the\r\nindications of the hygrometer and the barometer, and the delicate in\r\nhealth will do well to regard its warnings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n_Description of the Instrument._--The farmer's barometer, as figured in\r\nthe margin, consists of an upright tube of mercury inverted in a cistern\r\nof the same fluid; this is secured against a strong frame of wood, at the\r\nupper end of which is fixed the scale, divided into inches and tenths of\r\nan inch. On either side of the barometer, or centre tube, are two\r\nthermometers--that on the left hand has its bulb uncovered and freely\r\nexposed, and indicates the temperature of the air at the place of\r\nobservation; that on the right hand has its bulb covered with a piece of\r\nmuslin, from which depend a few threads of soft lamp cotton; this cotton\r\nis immersed in the small cup situated just under the thermometer, this\r\nvessel being full of water; the water rises by capillary attraction to the\r\nmuslin-covered bulb, and keeps it in a constantly moist state.\r\n\r\nThese two thermometers, which we distinguish by the names \"Wet Bulb\" and\r\n\"Dry Bulb,\" form the Hygrometer; and it is by the simultaneous reading of\r\nthese two thermometers, and noting the difference that exists between\r\ntheir indications, that the humidity in the atmosphere is determined.\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy's words (see p. 22) are placed upon the scale of the\r\nbarometer, as the value of a reading depends, not so much on the actual\r\nheight of the mercury in the tube, as it does on whether the column is\r\nrising, steady, or falling.\r\n\r\nThe moveable screw at the bottom of the cistern is for the purpose of\r\nforcing the mercury to the top of the tube when the instrument is being\r\ncarried from place to place, and it must always be unscrewed to its utmost\r\nlimit when the barometer is hung in its proper place. After this it should\r\nnever be touched.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the Hygrometer acts is as follows: It is a pretty\r\nwell-known fact that water or wine is often cooled by a wet cloth being\r\ntied round the bottle, and then being placed in a current of air. The\r\nevaporation that takes place in the progressive drying of the cloth causes\r\nthe temperature to fall considerably below that of the surrounding\r\natmosphere, and the contents of the bottle are thus cooled. In the same\r\nmanner, then, the covered wet bulb thermometer will be found _invariably_\r\nto read lower than the uncovered one; and the greater the dryness of the\r\nair, the greater will be the difference between the indications of the\r\ntwo thermometers; and the more moisture that exists in the air, the more\r\nnearly they will read alike.\r\n\r\nThe cup must be kept filled with pure water, and occasionally cleaned out,\r\nto remove any dirt. The muslin, or cotton-wick, should also be renewed\r\nevery few weeks. The hygrometer may be had separate from the barometer, if\r\nthe combined instruments cannot be sufficiently exposed to the external\r\nair, this being essential for the successful use of the hygrometer.\r\n\r\nThis farmer's weather-glass, then, consists of three distinct instruments:\r\nthe barometer, the thermometer, and the hygrometer. He has thus at command\r\nthe three instrumental data necessary for the prediction of the weather.\r\nAnd now to describe--\r\n\r\n_How to Use the Instrument._--The observations should be taken twice a\r\nday, say at 9 A.M. and 3 P.M.; and should be entered on a slip of paper,\r\nor a slate hung up by the barometer. The observer will then be able to see\r\nthe different values of the readings from time to time, and to draw his\r\nconclusions therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer on the left hand should first be read, and a note made of\r\nits indication, which is the temperature of the air. The wet bulb\r\nthermometer should now be read, and also noted; and the difference should\r\nbe taken of these two readings. Next read the barometer by moving the\r\nsmall index at the side of the tube until it is on a level with the top of\r\nthe mercury. Having noted the number of inches at which the column stands,\r\ncompare with the last observation, and see immediately whether the\r\nbarometer is rising, steady, or falling.\r\n\r\nNow, having taken the observations as above, we naturally ask the\r\nquestion, _What are we to predict from them?_\r\n\r\nAnd, probably, the best way of answering this query will be by giving an\r\nexample. We will suppose that our readings yesterday were as\r\nfollows:--Temperature, 70 deg.; Wet Bulb, 69 deg.; Difference, 1 deg.; =very moist\r\nair. Barometer, 29.5, and that rain has fallen.\r\n\r\nTo-day, we read:--Temperature, 60 deg.; Wet Bulb, 55 deg.; Difference, 5 deg.; =dryer\r\nair. Barometer, 30. We may safely predict that the rain will cease, and\r\nprobably we may have wind from the northward.\r\n\r\nIn spring or autumn, if the barometric height be steady any where between\r\n29.5 and 30 inches, with the temperature about 60 deg., fresh to moderate\r\nsouth-westerly winds, with cloudy sky, will probably characterize the\r\nweather; the indications of the hygrometer being then specially\r\nserviceable in enabling us to foretell rain; but if the mercury become\r\nsteady at about 30.5 inches, with temperature about 40 deg., north-easterly\r\nwinds, dry air, and clear sky, may be confidently expected.\r\n\r\nMany cases will doubtless suggest themselves to the observer where these\r\nfigures do not occur, and where he might find a difficulty in interpreting\r\nthe indications of his instruments. We have, therefore, drawn up some\r\nconcise rules for his guidance; and although they will not prove\r\nabsolutely infallible guides to this acknowledged most difficult problem,\r\nstill, they will be found of much service in foretelling the weather, when\r\nadded to an intelligent observation of ordinary atmospheric phenomena, as\r\nforce and direction of wind, nature of any particular season, and the time\r\nof year.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. RULES FOR FORETELLING THE WEATHER.\r\n\r\nA RISING BAROMETER.\r\n\r\n    A \"Rapid\" rise indicates unsettled weather.\r\n\r\n    A \"Gradual\" rise indicates settled weather.\r\n\r\n    A \"Rise,\" with dry air, and cold increasing in summer, indicates wind\r\n    from northward; and if rain has fallen, better weather is to be\r\n    expected.\r\n\r\n    A \"Rise,\" with moist air and a low temperature, indicates wind and\r\n    rain from northward.\r\n\r\n    A \"Rise,\" with southerly wind, indicates fine weather.\r\n\r\nA STEADY BAROMETER,\r\n\r\n    With dry air and a seasonable temperature, indicates a continuance of\r\n    very fine weather.\r\n\r\nA FALLING BAROMETER.\r\n\r\n    A \"Rapid\" fall indicates stormy weather.\r\n\r\n    A \"Rapid\" fall, with westerly wind, indicates stormy weather from\r\n    northward.\r\n\r\n    A \"Fall,\" with a northerly wind, indicates storm, with rain and hail\r\n    in summer, and snow in winter.\r\n\r\n    A \"Fall,\" with increased moisture in the air, and the heat increasing,\r\n    indicates wind and rain from southward.\r\n\r\n    A \"Fall,\" with dry air, and cold increasing (in winter), indicates\r\n    snow.\r\n\r\n    A \"Fall,\" after very calm and warm weather, indicates rain with\r\n    squally weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n=27. Causes which may bring about a Fall or a Rise in the\r\nBarometer.=[3]--As heat produces rarefaction, a sudden rise of temperature\r\nin a distant quarter may affect the weight of the atmosphere over our\r\nheads, by producing an aerial current outwards, to supply the place of the\r\nlighter air which has moved from its former position; in which case the\r\nbarometer will fall. Now such a movement in the atmosphere is likely to\r\nbring about an intermixture of currents of air of different temperatures,\r\nand from this intermixture rain is likely to result.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as cold produces condensation, any sudden fall of\r\ntemperature causes the column of air over the locality to contract and\r\nsink to a lower level, whilst other air rushes in from above to supply the\r\nvoid; and, accordingly, the barometer rises. Should this air, as often\r\nhappens, proceed from the north, it will contain in general but little\r\nmoisture; and hence, on reaching a warmer latitude, will take up the\r\nvapour of the air, so that dry weather will result.\r\n\r\nIt is generally observed, that wind causes a fall in the instrument; and,\r\nindeed, in those greater movements of the atmosphere which we denominate\r\nstorms or hurricanes, the depression is so considerable as to forewarn\r\nthe navigator of his impending danger. It is evident, that a draught of\r\nair in any direction must diminish the weight of the column overhead, and\r\nconsequently cause the mercury in the barometer to sink.\r\n\r\nThe connection, therefore, of a sinking of the barometric column with rain\r\nis frequently owing to the wind causing an intermixture of the aerial\r\ncurrents which, by their motion, diminish the weight of the atmosphere\r\nover our heads; whilst a steady rise in the column indicates the absence\r\nof any great atmospheric changes in the neighbourhood, and a general\r\nexemption from those causes which are apt to bring about a precipitation\r\nof vapour.\r\n\r\n\r\n=28. Use of the Barometer in the management of Mines.=--The inflammable\r\nand suffocating gases, known to coal-miners as fire-damp and choke-damp,\r\nare specifically heavier than air; and as they issue from the fissures of\r\nthe mine, or are released from the coal, the atmospheric pressure tends to\r\ndrive them into the lowest and least ventilated galleries. Consequently a\r\ngreatly reduced atmospheric pressure will favour a sudden outflow or\r\nadvance of gas; whence may result cases of explosion or suffocation. It\r\nhas been found that these accidents occur for the most part about the time\r\nof a low barometric column. A reliable barometer should, therefore, be\r\nsystematically consulted by those entrusted with the management or control\r\nof coal-mines, so that greater vigilance and caution may be enjoined on\r\nthe miners whenever the mercury falls low, especially after it has been\r\nunusually high for some days.\r\n\r\n\r\n=29. Use of the Barometer in estimating the Height of Tides.=--The\r\npressure of the atmosphere affects the height of the tide, the water being\r\nin general higher as the barometer is lower. The expressions of seamen,\r\nthat \"frost nips the tide,\" and \"fog nips the tide,\" are explained by the\r\nhigh barometer which usually accompanies frost and fog. M. Daussy, Sir J.\r\nC. Ross, and others, have established that a rise of one inch in the\r\nbarometer will have a corresponding fall in the tide of about one foot.\r\nTherefore navigators and pilots will appreciate the following suggestion\r\nof Admiral FitzRoy:--\r\n\r\n\"Vessels sometimes enter docks, or even harbours, where they have scarcely\r\na foot of water more than their draught; and as docking, as well as\r\nlaunching large ships, requires a close calculation of height of water,\r\nthe state of the barometer becomes of additional importance on such\r\noccasions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSYPHON TUBE BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=30. Principle of.=--If some mercury, or any other fluid, be poured into a\r\ntube of glass, bent in the form of =U=, and open at both ends, it will\r\nrise to the same height in both limbs, the tube being held vertically. If\r\nmercury be poured in first, and then water upon it at one end, these\r\nliquids will not come to the same level; the water will stand much higher\r\nthan the mercury. If the height of the mercury, above the line of meeting\r\nof the fluids, be one inch, that of the water will be about\r\nthirteen-and-a-half inches. The explanation of this is, that the two\r\ncolumns balance each other. The pressure of the atmosphere in each limb is\r\nprecisely similar; but the one column stands so much higher than the\r\nother, because the fluid of which it is composed is so much lighter, bulk\r\nfor bulk, than the other. If one end of the tube be hermetically closed,\r\nthe other limb be cut off within a few inches of the bend, and the tube\r\ncarefully filled with mercury; by placing it in a vertical position, the\r\nmercury will fall, if the closed limb be long enough, until it is about\r\nthirty inches higher than that in the exposed limb, where it will remain.\r\nHere the atmosphere presses upon the short column; but not upon the long\r\none. It is this pressure, therefore, which maintains the difference of\r\nlevel. In fact, it forms a barometer without a cistern, the short limb\r\nanswering the purpose of a cistern. The first barometers on this principle\r\nwere devised by the celebrated philosopher, Dr. Hook, as described in the\r\nnext section.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. DIAL, OR WHEEL BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\nThe familiar household \"Weather Glasses\" are barometers on the syphon\r\nprinciple. The portions of the two limbs through which the mercury will\r\nrise and fall with the varying pressure of the atmosphere are made of\r\nprecisely the same diameter; while the part between them is contracted. On\r\nthe mercury, in the exposed limb, rests a round float of ivory or glass;\r\nto this a string is attached and passed over and around a brass pulley,\r\nthe other end carrying another lighter weight. The weight resting on the\r\nmercury rises and falls with it. On the spindle of the pulley, which\r\npasses through the frame and centre of the dial-plate, is fixed a light\r\nsteel hand, which revolves as the pulley turns round. When the mercury\r\nfalls for a decrease of atmospheric pressure, it rises by the same\r\nquantity in the short tube, and pushes up the float, the counterpoise\r\nfalls, and thus moves the hand or pointer to the left. When the pressure\r\nincreases, the pointer is drawn in a similar manner to the right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe dials are generally made of metal silvered over or enamelled, but\r\nporcelain may be used. If the circumference of the pulley, or \"wheel,\" be\r\ntwo inches, it will revolve once for an alteration of level amounting to\r\ntwo inches in each tube, or four inches in the height of the barometric\r\ncolumn; and as the dial may be from twenty to thirty-six inches in\r\ncircumference, five to nine inches on the graduated scale corresponds to\r\none inch of the column; and hence the sub-divisions are distinctly\r\nperceptible, and a vernier is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the pointer alone is visible; and a mahogany, or rosewood,\r\nframe, supports, covers, and renders the instrument ornamental and\r\nportable. In the back of the frame is a hinged door, which covers the\r\ncavity containing the tube and fixtures. The dial is covered by a glass in\r\na brass rim, similar to a clock face. A brass index, working over the\r\ndial, moveable by a key or button, may be applied, and will serve to\r\nregister the position of the hand when last observed. These instruments\r\nare usually fitted with a thermometer, and a spirit level; the latter for\r\nthe purpose of getting the instrument perfectly vertical. They sometimes\r\nhave, in addition, a hygrometer, a sympiesometer, an aneroid, a mirror, or\r\na clock, &c., singly or combined. The frame admits of much variety of\r\nstyle and decoration. It may be carved or inlaid. The usual adjustment of\r\nscale is suited for localities at no considerable elevation above the\r\nsea. Accordingly, being commercial articles, they have been found\r\nfrequently quite out of place. When intended for use at high elevations,\r\nthey should have a special adjustment of scale. As household instruments\r\nthey are serviceable, and ornamental. But the supply-and-demand principle\r\nupon which they are sold, has entailed upon those issued by inferior\r\nmakers a generally bad adjustment of scale. The illustrations are those of\r\nordinary designs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\nDial barometers required for transmission to distant parts, as India and\r\nthe Colonies, are furnished with a steel stop-cock, to render them\r\nportable more effectually than can be done by the method of _plugging_ the\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n\r\n32. STANDARD SYPHON BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nFig. 24 represents the most accurate form of the Gay Lussac barometer. The\r\nshort limb is closed at the top, after the mercury is introduced, and a\r\nsmall lateral puncture is made at _a_, which is covered over with a\r\nsubstance which permits the access of air, but prevents the escape of any\r\nmercury when the instrument is packed for travelling. The bent part of the\r\ntube is contracted to a capillary bore; and just above this, in the long\r\nlimb, is placed the air-trap, already described (see p. 17), and here\r\nillustrated (fig. 25). When reversed, as it must be for portability, the\r\ncapillary attraction keeps the mercury in the long branch. Should the\r\nmercury of the short column get detached, some small quantity of air _may_\r\npass; but it will be arrested at the pipette, and will not vitiate the\r\nlength of the barometric column. It can be easily expelled by gently\r\nshaking or tapping the instrument before suspending it for observation. In\r\nthe illustration, the zero of the scale is placed at Z, near the middle of\r\nthe tube; and the graduations extend above and below. In making an\r\nobservation, it is necessary to take the reading ZA on the long branch,\r\nand ZB on the short one. The sum of the two gives the height of the\r\nbarometer. The zero of the scale in some instruments is placed low down,\r\nso as to require the difference of the two readings to be taken. A\r\nthermometer is attached to the frame as usual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nThese instruments can be very accurately graduated, and are very exact in\r\ntheir indications, provided great care has been exercised in selecting the\r\ntubes, which must be of the same calibre throughout the parts destined to\r\nmeasure the variations of atmospheric pressure. They should be suspended\r\nso as to insure their hanging vertically.\r\n\r\nThe syphon barometer does not require correction for capillarity nor for\r\ncapacity, as each surface of the mercury is equally depressed by capillary\r\nattraction, and the quantity of mercury which falls from the long limb of\r\nthe tube occupies the same length in the short one. The barometric height\r\nmust, however, be corrected for temperature, as in the cistern barometer.\r\nTables containing the temperature corrections to be applied to barometer\r\nreadings for scales engraved on the glass tube, or on brass or wood\r\nframes, are published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBAROGRAPHS, OR SELF-REGISTERING BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=33. Milne's Self-Registering Barometer.=--For a long time a good and\r\naccurate self-recording barometer was much desired. This want is now\r\nsatisfactorily supplied, not by one, but by several descriptions of\r\napparatus. The one first to be described was the design of Admiral Sir A.\r\nMilne, who himself constructed, in 1857, we believe, the original\r\ninstrument, which he used with much success. Since that time several of\r\nthese instruments have been made, and have performed satisfactorily. The\r\nbarometer tube is a syphon of large calibre, provided with a Gay Lussac\r\npipette, or air-trap; and fitted with a float, a wheel, and a pointer, as\r\nin the \"Dial\" barometer. The float is attached to a delicate watch-chain,\r\nwhich passes over the wheel and is adequately counterpoised. Behind the\r\nindicating extremity of the pointer or hand is a projecting point, which\r\nfaces the frame of the instrument, and is just within contact with the\r\nregistering paper. A clock is applied, and fitted with auxiliary\r\nmechanism, so as to be able to move the mounted paper with regularity\r\nbehind the pointer, and at designed equal intervals of time to release a\r\nsystem of levers and springs, so as to cause the marker to impress a dot\r\non the paper, either by puncture or pencil-mark. The paper is ruled with\r\nhorizontal lines for the range of the mercurial column, and parallel arcs\r\nof circles for the hours. Thus the barometer is rendered self-recording,\r\nby night or day, for a week or more; hence the great value of the\r\ninstrument. The clock, index, and registering mechanism are protected from\r\ndust and interference by a glass front, hinged on and locked. As the\r\ntemperature of the mercury is not registered, there is fixed to the frame\r\na Sixe's thermometer to record the maximum and minimum temperatures, which\r\nshould be noted at least every twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy has suggested the name \"Atmoscope\" for Admiral Milne's\r\nbarometer; and he has also termed it a \"Barograph.\" This latter word\r\nappears to be applicable to all kinds of self-registering barometers\r\nhitherto designed. Of the arrangement under consideration Admiral FitzRoy\r\nwrites:--\"It shows the alterations in tension, or the pulsations, so to\r\nspeak, of atmosphere, on a large scale, by hourly marks; and the diagram\r\nexpresses, to a practised observer, what the 'indicator card' of a\r\nsteam-cylinder shows to a skilful engineer, or a stethescope to a\r\nphysician.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\n=34. Modification of Milne's Barometer.=--The great difficulty to be\r\novercome in Milne's barometer, is to adjust the mechanism for obtaining\r\nregistration so that the action of the striker upon the pointer should not\r\nin the slightest degree move it from its true position. A different mode\r\nof registration, capable of recording accurately the least appreciable\r\nmovement of the mercurial column, has been effected. In this instrument\r\nthe registering paper is carried upon a cylinder or drum. By reference to\r\nthe illustration, Fig. 26, the details of construction will be readily\r\nunderstood. It should, however, be mentioned, that it is not a picture of\r\nthe outward appearance of the instrument. The position of the barometer\r\nshould be behind the clock; it is represented on one side merely for the\r\npurpose of clearly illustrating the arrangement and principles. The\r\ninstrument has a large syphon barometer tube, in which the mercurial\r\ncolumn is represented. On the mercury at _A_, in its open end, rests a\r\nglass float, attached to a watch-chain, or suitable silken cord, the other\r\nend of which is connected to the top of the arched head on the short arm\r\nof a lever-beam. The long arm of the beam is twice the length of the short\r\narm, for the following reason. As the mercury falls in the long limb, it\r\nrises through an equal space in the short limb of the tube, and _vice\r\nversa_. But the barometric column is the difference of height of the\r\nmercury in the two limbs; hence the rise or fall of the float through\r\nhalf-an-inch will correspond to a decrease or an increase of the\r\nbarometric column of one inch. In order, then, to record the movements of\r\nthe barometric column, and not those of the float, the arm of the beam\r\nconnected with the float is only half the radius of the other arm. Both\r\narms of the beam carry circular-arched heads, which are similar portions\r\nof the complete circles, the centre of curvature being the fulcrum, or\r\naxis. This contrivance maintains the leverage on each extremity of the\r\nbeam always at the same distance from the fulcrum. From the top of the\r\nlarge arched head a piece of watch-chain descends, and is attached to the\r\nmarker, _B_, which properly counterpoises the float, _A_, and is capable\r\nof easy movement along a groove in a brass bar, so as to indicate the\r\nbarometric height on an ivory scale, _C_, fixed on the same vertical\r\nframing. On the opposite side of the marker, _B_, is formed a metallic\r\npoint, which faces the registration sheet and is nearly in contact with\r\nit. The framing, which carries the scale and marker, is an arrangement of\r\nbrass bars, delicately adjusted and controlled by springs, so as to permit\r\nof a quick horizontal motion, in a small arc, being communicated to it by\r\nthe action of the hammer, _E_, of the clock, whereby the point of the\r\nmarker is caused to impress a dot upon the paper. The same clock gives\r\nrotation to the hollow wooden cylinder, _D_, upon which is mounted the\r\nregistering paper. The clock must be rewound when a fresh paper is\r\nattached to the cylinder, which may be daily, weekly, or monthly,\r\naccording to construction; and the series of dots impressed upon the paper\r\nshows the height of the barometric column every hour by day and night. The\r\nspace traversed by the marker is precisely equal to the range of the\r\nbarometric column.\r\n\r\n\r\n=35. King's Self-Registering Barometer.=--Mr. Alfred King, Engineer of the\r\nLiverpool Gas-light Company, designed, so long ago as 1854, a barometer to\r\nregister, by a continuous pencil-tracing, the variations in the weight of\r\nthe atmosphere; and a highly-satisfactory self-recording barometer, on his\r\nprinciple and constructed under his immediate superintendence, has quite\r\nrecently been erected at the Liverpool Observatory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\nFig. 27 is the front elevation of this instrument. _A_, the barometer\r\ntube, is three inches in internal diameter, and it floats freely (not\r\nbeing fixed as usual) in the fixed cistern, _B_, guided by\r\nfriction-wheels, _W_. The top end of the tube is fastened to a peculiar\r\nchain, which passes over a grooved wheel turning on finely-adjusted\r\nfriction rollers. The other end of the chain supports the frame, _D_,\r\nwhich carries the tracing pencil. The frame is suitably weighted and\r\nguided, and faces the cylinder, _C_, around which the tracing paper is\r\nwrapped, and which rotates once in twenty-four hours by the movement of a\r\nclock. Mr. Hartnup, Director of the Liverpool Observatory, in his Annual\r\nReport, 1868, says:--\"For one inch change in the mercurial column the\r\npencil is moved through five inches, so that the horizontal lines on the\r\ntracing, which are half an inch apart, represent one-tenth of an inch\r\nchange in the barometer. The vertical lines are hour lines, and being\r\nnearly three-quarters of an inch apart, it will be seen that the smallest\r\nappreciable change in the barometer, and the time of its occurrence, are\r\nrecorded.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been remarked by persons in the habit of reading barometers with\r\nlarge tubes, that, in squally weather, sudden and frequent oscillations\r\nof the mercurial column are sometimes seen. Now, to register these small\r\noscillations must be a very delicate test of the sensitiveness of a\r\nself-registering barometer, as the time occupied by the rise and fall of\r\nthe mercury in the tube in some cases does not exceed one minute.\" Mr.\r\nHartnup affirms that the tracing of this instrument exhibits such\r\noscillations whenever the wind blows strong and in squalls.\r\n\r\nAs the barometer in this instrument is precisely similar to the \"Long\r\nRange Barometer\" invented by Mr. McNeild (and which will be found\r\ndescribed at page 48), it may be desirable to quote the following, from\r\nMr. Hartnup's Report:--\"Mr. King constructed a small model instrument to\r\nillustrate the principle. This instrument was entrusted to my care for\r\nexamination, and it was exhibited to the scientific gentlemen who visited\r\nthe Observatory in 1854, during the meeting of the British Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Science.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=36. Syphon, with Photographic Registration.=--A continuous\r\nself-registering barometer has been constructed, in which photography is\r\nemployed. Those who may wish to adopt a similar apparatus, or thoroughly\r\nto understand the arrangements and mode of observation, should consult the\r\ndetailed description given in the _Greenwich Magnetical and Meteorological\r\nObservations_, 1847. As the principles are applicable to photographic\r\nregistration of magnetic and electric as well as meteorologic variations\r\nin instrumental indications, it would be beside our purpose to describe\r\nfully the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe barometer is a large syphon tube; the bore of the upper and lower\r\nextremities, through which the surfaces of the mercury rise and fall, is\r\n1-1/10 inch in diameter. The glass float in the open limb is attached to a\r\nwire, which moves a delicately-supported light lever as it alters its\r\nelevation. The fulcrum of the lever is on one side of the wire; the\r\nextremity on the other side, at four times this distance from the fulcrum,\r\ncarries a vertical plate of opaque mica, having a small aperture. Through\r\nthis hole the light of a gas-jet shines upon photographic paper wrapped\r\nround a cylinder placed vertically, and moved round its axis by a clock\r\nfixed with its face horizontal. The cylinder is delicately supported, and\r\nrevolves in friction rollers. A bent wire on the axis is embraced by a\r\nprong on the hour hand of the time-piece; therefore the cylinder is\r\ncarried round once in twelve hours. It might be arranged for a different\r\nperiod of rotation.\r\n\r\nAs the cylinder rotates, the paper receives the action of the light, and a\r\nphotographic trace is left of the movements of the barometer four times\r\nthe extent of the oscillations of the float, or twice the length of the\r\nvariations in the barometric column. Certain chemical processes are\r\nrequired in the preparation of the paper, and in developing the trace. The\r\ndiagram which we give on the next page, with the explanation, taken from\r\nDrew's _Practical Meteorology_, will enable the above description to be\r\nbetter understood:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\n\"_Q e_ is a lever whose fulcrum is _e_, the counterpoise _f_ nearly\r\nsupporting it; _s_ is an opaque plate of mica, with a small aperture at\r\n_p_, through which the light passes, having before been refracted by a\r\ncylindrical lens into a long ray, the portion only of which opposite the\r\naperture _p_ impinges on the paper; _d_ is a wire supported by a float on\r\nthe surface of the mercury; _G H_ is the barometer; _p_, the vertical\r\ncylinder charged with photographic paper; _r_, the photographic trace;\r\n_I_, the timepiece, carrying round the cylinder by the projecting arm _t_.\r\nIt is evident that the respective distances of the float and the aperture\r\n_p_ from the fulcrum may be regulated so that the rise and fall of the\r\nfloat may be multiplied to any extent required.\" When _only_ the lower\r\nsurface of the mercury in a syphon barometer is read, as in the instrument\r\njust described, a correction for temperature is strictly due to the height\r\nof the quicksilver in the _short_ tube; but this in so short a column will\r\nrarely be sensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=37. The Syphon Tube Mountain Barometer, on Gay Lussac's principle=,\r\nconstructed as described at page 31, and fixed in a metallic tubular\r\nframe, forms a simple and light travelling instrument. The graduations are\r\nmade upon the frame, and it is suspended for reading by a ring at the top,\r\nfrom beneath an iron tripod stand, which is usually supplied with it.\r\nConsiderable care is requisite in adjusting the verniers, so as to keep\r\nthe instrument steady and vertical. A drawback to the convenience of this\r\nbarometer is the movement of the mercury in the short limb, which is\r\ngenerally not confined, and hence has every facility for becoming quickly\r\noxidised in travelling. To remedy this, Messrs. Negretti and Zambra so\r\nconstruct the Mountain Syphon Barometer that by a simple half turn of a\r\nscrew the mercury can be confined for portability, while the lower limb\r\ncan be taken out for cleaning whenever found requisite.\r\n\r\n\r\n=38. Mountain Barometer on Fortin's principle.=--This barometer, with\r\nFortin's cistern, as arranged by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, is an\r\nelegant, manageable, and very accurate instrument for travelling purposes,\r\nand well adapted for careful measurement of heights. The cistern is made\r\nlarge enough to receive all the mercury that will fall from the tube at\r\nthe highest attainable elevation. The screw at the bottom confines the\r\nmercury securely for carriage, and serves to adjust the surface of the\r\nmercury to the zero of the scale when making an observation. The vernier\r\nreads to .002 of an inch, and slides easily on the brass frame, which is\r\nmade as small in diameter as is compatible with the size of the tube. The\r\ntube in this barometer should be altogether without contractions, so that\r\nthe mercury will readily fall when it is set up for observation. It must\r\nbe carefully calibrated, and its internal diameter ascertained, in order\r\nthat correction may be made for capillarity. This correction, however,\r\nshould be combined with the error of graduation, and form a permanent\r\nindex error, ascertainable at any time by comparison with an acknowledged\r\nstandard barometer.\r\n\r\nThe barometer is supported in the tripod stand (furnished as part of the\r\ninstrument) when used for observation. It is suspended by placing two\r\nstuds, in the ring on the frame, in slots formed on the top of the stand,\r\nso that it hangs freely and vertically in gimbals. To the metal top of\r\nthe stand, mahogany legs are hinged. To make the barometer portable, it\r\nmust be lifted out of the stand, sloped gently until the mercury reaches\r\nthe top, turning the screw at the bottom meanwhile; then invert and screw\r\nuntil the mercury is made tight. The inverted instrument packs in the\r\nstand, the legs being formed to fit round the frame; and receptacles are\r\nscooped out for the cistern, thermometer, gimbals, and vernier; so that\r\nthe instrument is firmly surrounded by the wooden legs, which are held\r\nfast together by brass rings passed over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\n=39. Newman's Mountain Barometer.=--Fig. 29 is an illustration of the\r\nmountain barometer known as Newman's. The cistern consists of two separate\r\ncompartments;--the top of the lower and the bottom of the upper, being\r\nperfectly flat, are pivoted closely together at the centres, so that the\r\nlower can move through a small arc, when turned by the hand. This movement\r\nis limited by two stops. The top of the lower compartment and the bottom\r\nof the upper have each a circular hole, through which the mercury\r\ncommunicates. When the instrument is required for observation, the cistern\r\nis turned close up to the stop marked \"_open_\" or \"_not portable_.\" When\r\nit is necessary to pack it for travelling, the mercurial column must be\r\nallowed to fill the tube by sloping the barometer gently; then invert it,\r\nand move the cistern to the stop marked \"_shut_\" or \"_portable_.\" In this\r\ncondition, the upper compartment is completely filled with mercury, and\r\nconsequently that in the tube cannot move about, so as to admit air or\r\nendanger the tube. Nor can the mercury pass back to the lower compartment,\r\nas the holes are not now coincident, and the contact is made too perfect\r\nto allow the mercury to creep between the surfaces. The tube does not\r\nenter the lower compartment, which is completely full of mercury when the\r\ninstrument is arranged for observation. The spare capacity of the upper\r\ncistern is sufficient to receive the mercury which descends from the tube\r\nto the limit of the engraved scale, which in these barometers generally\r\nextends only to about 20 inches. A lower limit could of course be given by\r\nincreasing the size of the cisterns, which it is not advisable to do\r\nunless for a special purpose. This barometer may be had mounted in wood,\r\nor in brass frame. If in wood, it has a brass shield, which slides round\r\nthe scale part of the frame, so as to be easily brought in front of the\r\ntube and scale as a protection in travelling; the vernier screw, in this\r\ncase, being placed at the top of the instrument. When the scale is\r\ngraduated with true inches, the neutral point, the capacity and\r\ncapillarity corrections should be marked on the frame. The graduated\r\nscales, however, placed on these barometers in brass frames, are usually\r\nartificial inches, like the Kew plan of graduation; the advantage being\r\nthat one simple correction only is required, viz. one for index error and\r\ncapillarity combined, which can always be readily determined by comparison\r\nwith a standard barometer; moreover, as no adjustment of cistern is\r\nrequired in reading, the instrument can be verified by artificial pressure\r\nthroughout the scale, by the plan practised at Kew, Liverpool, &c., and\r\nalready described (see p. 18).\r\n\r\n\r\n40. NEGRETTI & ZAMBRA'S PATENT MOUNTAIN AND OTHER BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\nThis invention is intended to make mountain and other barometers of\r\nstandard accuracy stronger, more portable, and less liable to derangement,\r\nwhen being carried about, than heretofore, by dispensing with the ordinary\r\nflexible cistern containing the mercury at the bottom of the instrument,\r\nand adapting in lieu thereof a rigid cistern constructed of glass and\r\niron. The cistern is composed of a glass cylinder, which is secured in a\r\nmetallic tube or frame. In order to render the cistern mercury-tight at\r\ntop and bottom, metal caps are screwed into the tube or frame, and bear\r\nagainst leather washers placed between them and the edges of the glass\r\ncylinder. The upper cap of the cistern is tapped with a fine threaded\r\nscrew to receive the iron plug or socket, into which the barometer tube is\r\nsecurely fixed. The whole length of this plug has a fine screw cut upon it\r\nby which the cistern can be screwed up or down. At the side of this plug\r\nor socket, extending from the lower end to within half an inch of the top,\r\nis cut a groove for admitting the air to the surface of the mercury within\r\nthe cistern when the barometer is in use. An ivory point is screwed into\r\nthe under surface of the plug, carrying the barometer tube. This ivory\r\npoint is very carefully adjusted by measurement to be the zero point of\r\nthe instrument, from which the barometer scale of inches is divided. The\r\nsurface of the mercury in the cistern is adjusted to the zero point by\r\nscrewing the cistern up or down until the ivory point and its reflected\r\nimage are in contact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument (fig. 30) is shown in a state of adjustment, ready to take\r\nan observation; but _when it is desired to render it portable, it must be\r\ninclined, until mercury from the cistern fills the tube; the cistern must\r\nthen be screwed up on the socket_, so as to bring the face of the upper\r\ncap against the under side of the shoulder of the cover immediately above\r\nit; the instrument may then be carried without being liable to\r\nderangement.\r\n\r\n_Precautions necessary in using the Mountain Barometer._--On removing the\r\nbarometer from its case after a journey, allow it to remain with its scale\r\nend downward, whilst the cistern is unscrewed to the extent of _one turn\r\nof the screw_, after which slightly shake the cistern; the mercury in it\r\nwill then completely fill the end of the barometer tube, should any\r\nportion of it have escaped therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe barometer is then inverted, and if it be desired to make an\r\nobservation, suspend it vertically from its stand by the ring at top. The\r\ncistern must then be unscrewed, until the surface of the mercury is\r\nbrought just level with the extreme end of the ivory or zero point fixed\r\nto the iron plug on which the glass cistern moves up and down.\r\n\r\nShould the elevation of the place where the barometer is to be used be\r\nconsiderably above the sea level, it will be well--after suspending it\r\nfrom the stand--to unscrew the cistern several turns, _holding the\r\nbarometer in an oblique position_, as at great heights the mercury will\r\nfall considerably quicker than the cistern can be unscrewed, thereby\r\nfilling it to overflowing; but by partly unscrewing the cistern first,\r\nroom is given for the reception of a fall of mercury to the extent of\r\nseveral inches.\r\n\r\nThe cistern must not be unscrewed when the _Instrument is_ INVERTED _more\r\nthan_ two turns of the screw, otherwise the mercury will flow out through\r\nthe groove.\r\n\r\nIt is found safer when travelling to carry the barometer in a horizontal\r\nposition, or with its cistern end uppermost.\r\n\r\n_To clean the Barometer._--Should at any time the mercury in the cistern\r\nbecome oxidised, and reading from its surface be difficult, it can be\r\nreadily cleaned by removing the cistern and its contained mercury from the\r\nbarometer frame by unscrewing it _when in a horizontal position_; this\r\nprecaution is necessary that the mercury in the tube may not escape, and\r\nthereby allow air to enter. The cistern must then be emptied, and with a\r\ndry clean leather, or silk handkerchief, well cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe operation of cleaning being performed, return the cistern to the\r\nframe, and screw it until the face is brought up against the under side of\r\nthe shoulder, still keeping the instrument _horizontal_. The cistern is\r\nnow ready for re-filling, to do which stand the barometer on end _head\r\ndownwards_, and remove the small screw at bottom; through the aperture\r\nthus opened, pour in mercury, passing it through a paper funnel with a\r\nvery small aperture. It is well to pass the mercury through a very small\r\nfunnel two or three times before returning it to the barometer cistern, as\r\nby this process all particles of dust or oxide adhere to the paper, and\r\nare effectually removed.\r\n\r\nShould any small quantity of the mercury be lost during the operation of\r\ncleaning, it is of no importance so long as sufficient remains to allow of\r\nadjustment to the zero point. This latter constitutes one of the great\r\nadvantages of this new instrument over the ordinary barometer; for, in the\r\nmajority of cases, after an instrument has been compared carefully with a\r\nstandard, should mercury be lost, there is no means of correcting the\r\nerror unless a standard barometer be at hand; the new barometer is, in\r\nthis respect, independent, a little mercury more or less being\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=41. Short Tube Barometer.=--This is simply a tube shorter, as may be\r\nrequired, than that necessary to show the atmospheric pressure at the sea\r\nlevel. It is convenient for balloon purposes, and for use at mountain\r\nstations, being of course a special construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n=42. Method of Calculating Heights by the Barometer.=--The pressure of the\r\natmosphere being measured by the barometer, it is evident that as the\r\ninstrument is carried up a high mountain or elevated in a balloon, the\r\nlength of the column must decrease as the atmospheric pressure decreases,\r\nin consequence of a stratum of air being left below. The pressure of air\r\narises from its weight, or the attraction of gravitation upon it, and\r\ntherefore the quantity of air below the barometer cistern cannot influence\r\nthe height of the column. Hence it follows that a certain relation must\r\nexist between the difference of the barometric pressure at the foot and at\r\nthe top of a hill or other elevation, and the difference of the absolute\r\nheights above the sea. Theoretical investigation, abundantly confirmed by\r\npractical results, has determined that the strata of air decrease in\r\ndensity in a geometrical proportion, while the elevations increase in an\r\narithmetical one. Hence we have a method of determining differences of\r\nlevel, by observations made on the density of the air by means of the\r\nbarometer. It is beyond our purpose to explain in detail the principles\r\nupon which this method is founded, or to give its mathematical\r\ninvestigation. We append Tables, which will be useful to practical\r\npersons,--surveyors, engineers, travellers, tourists, &c.,--who may carry\r\na barometer as a travelling companion.\r\n\r\nTable I. is calculated from the formula, height in feet = 60,200 (log.\r\n29.922 - log. B) + 925; where 29.922 is the mean atmospheric pressure at\r\n32 deg. F., and the mean sea-level in latitude 45 deg.; and B is any other\r\nbarometric pressure; the 925 being added to avoid minus signs in the\r\nTable.\r\n\r\nTable II. contains the correction necessary for the mean temperature of\r\nthe stratum of air between the stations of observation; and is computed\r\nfrom Regnault's co-efficient for the expansion of air, which is .002036 of\r\nits volume at 32 deg. for each degree above that temperature.\r\n\r\nTable III. is the correction due to the difference of gravitation in any\r\nother latitude, and is found from the formula, _x_ = 1 + .00265 cos. 2\r\nlat.\r\n\r\nTable IV. is to correct for the diminution of gravity in ascending from\r\nthe sea-level.\r\n\r\nTo use these Tables: The barometer readings at the upper and lower\r\nstations having been corrected and reduced to temperature 32 deg. F., take out\r\nfrom Table I. the numbers opposite the corrected readings, and subtract\r\nthe lower from the upper. Multiply this difference successively by the\r\nfactors found in Tables II. and III. The factor from Table III. may be\r\nneglected unless precision is desired. Finally, add the correction taken\r\nfrom Table IV.\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n_Approximate Height due to Barometric Pressure._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------+\r\n  |Inches.|

Glashier, Esq.,\r\nF.R.S., will serve for practice.[4]\r\n\r\n2. Ascended from Wolverhampton, 18th August, 1862, at 2h. 38m. p.m.;\r\nbarometer (in all cases corrected and reduced to 32 deg. F) was 14.868, the\r\ntemperature of the air 26 deg.; at the same time, at Wrottesley Hall, 531 feet\r\nabove the sea, in latitude 52-1/2 deg. N, the barometer was 29.46, and the\r\ntemperature of the air 65 deg.4; find the elevation of the balloon above the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n  Height, 18,959 feet.\r\n\r\n3. From the same place an ascent was made 5th September, 1862, when at 1h.\r\n48m. p.m. barometer was 11.954, air O deg.; at Wrottesley Hall 29.38, air 56 deg.\r\n\r\n  Height, 23,923 feet.\r\n\r\n4. From the Crystal Palace a balloon ascent was made 20th August, 1862. At\r\n6h. 47m. p.m. barometer was 25.55, air 50 deg.5; and at the same time at\r\nGreenwich Observatory, at 159 feet above the sea, the barometer was 29.81,\r\nair 63 deg.\r\n\r\n  Height, 4,406 feet.\r\n\r\n5. From the same place an ascent was made 8th September, 1862. At 5 p.m.,\r\nthe balloon being over Blackheath, barometer was 25.60, and the air 49 deg.5,\r\nwhile at Greenwich, barometer was 29.92, air 66 deg.4.\r\n\r\n  Height, 4,461 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=43. Desirability of Magnifying the Barometer Range.=--The limits within\r\nwhich the ordinary barometric column oscillates, do not exceed four inches\r\nfor extreme range, while the ordinary range is confined to about two\r\ninches; hence it has often been felt that the public utility of the\r\ninstrument would be greatly enhanced if by any means the scale indications\r\ncould be increased in length. This object was sought to be obtained by\r\nbending the upper part of the tube from the vertical, so that the inches\r\non the scale could be increased in length in proportion to the secant of\r\nthe angle it made with the vertical. This was called \"the diagonal\r\nbarometer.\" The upper part of the tube has also been formed into a spiral,\r\nand the scale, placed along it, is thus greatly enlarged.\r\n\r\nBut these methods of enlarging the indications cannot be so successfully\r\naccomplished, nor so cheaply nor so elegantly, as is done by the principle\r\nemployed in the dial barometer. Hence they are not in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\n=44. Howson's Long Range Barometer.=--Very recently quite a novel design\r\nhas been patented by Mr. Howson, for a long range barometer. The\r\nconstruction requires neither distortion of the tube, nor mechanism for\r\nconverting a short scale into a long one; but the mercury itself rises and\r\nfalls, through an extended range, naturally, and in simple obedience to\r\nthe varying pressure of the atmosphere. The tube is fixed, but its cistern\r\nis sustained by the mere pressure of the atmosphere. Looking at the\r\ninstrument, it seems a perfect marvel. It appears as though the cistern\r\nwith the mercury in it must fall to the ground. The bore of the tube is\r\nwide, about an inch across. A long glass rod is fixed to the bottom of the\r\nglass cistern, where a piece of cork or some elastic substance is also\r\nplaced. The tube is filled with mercury; the glass rod is plunged into the\r\ntube as it is held top downwards, until the cork gets close up to the tube\r\nand fits tightly against it. The pressure against the cork simply prevents\r\nthe mercury from coming out while the instrument is being inverted. When\r\nit is inverted, the mercury partly falls, and forms an ordinary barometric\r\ncolumn. When the top is held, the cistern and glass rod, instead of\r\nfalling away, remain perfectly suspended. There is no material support to\r\nthe cistern; the tube only is fixed, the cistern hangs to it. Glass is\r\nmany times lighter than mercury. When the glass rod is introduced, it\r\ndisplaces an equal volume of mercury. The glass rod, being so much lighter\r\nthan mercury, floats and sustains the additional weight of the cistern by\r\nits buoyancy. In the mean time, the atmosphere is acting upon the mercury,\r\nkeeping up the ordinary barometric column. Supposing there is a rise in\r\nthe ordinary barometer, the atmosphere presses some more mercury up the\r\ntube. This mercury is taken out of the cistern, which of course becomes\r\nlighter, and therefore the rod and cistern float up a little higher, which\r\nthus causes the column of mercury to rise still more. The increased\r\npressure and buoyancy thus acting together, increase the ascent in the\r\nbarometric column, as shown by the fixed scale. One inch in the barometer\r\nmight be represented by two or more inches in this instrument, according\r\nto construction. Supposing there was a decrease of pressure, the mercury\r\nwould fall, come into the cistern, make it heavier, and increase the fall\r\nsomewhat. Friction guides, at the top of the rod, prevent it coming into\r\ncontact with the side of the tube when vertically suspended. The\r\nillustration, Fig. 31, shows the appearance of the instrument as framed in\r\nwood by the makers, Messrs. Negretti and Zambra.\r\n\r\n\r\n=45. McNeild's Long Range Barometer.=--A barometer designed by a gentleman\r\nnamed McNeild is on a directly opposite principle to the one just\r\ndescribed. The tube is made to float on the mercury in the cistern. It is\r\nfilled with mercury, inverted in the usual manner, then allowed to float,\r\nbeing held vertically by glass friction points or guides. By this\r\ncontrivance, the ordinary range of the barometer is greatly increased. One\r\ninch rise or fall in the standard barometer may be represented by four or\r\nfive inches in this instrument, so that it shows small variations in\r\natmospheric pressure very distinctly. As the mercury falls in the tube\r\nwith a decrease of pressure, the surface of the mercury in the cistern\r\nrises, and the floating tube rises also, which causes an additional\r\ndescent in the column, as shown by fixed graduations on the tube. With an\r\nincrease of pressure, some mercury will leave the cistern and rise in the\r\ntube, while the tube itself will fall, and so cause an additional ascent\r\nof mercury. This barometer is identical in principle with King's Barograph\r\n(see p. 34).\r\n\r\nThe construction of Howson's and McNeild's Barometers has been assigned to\r\nMessrs. Negretti and Zambra. These instruments are usually made for\r\ndomestic purposes with a scale of from three to five, and for public use\r\nfrom five to eight times the scale of the ordinary standard. Their\r\nsensitiveness is consequently increased in an equal proportion, and they\r\nhave the additional advantage of not being affected by differences of\r\nlevel in the cistern. However, these novelties have not been sufficiently\r\ntried to determine their practical value for strictly scientific\r\npurposes; but as weather-glasses, for showing minute changes, they are\r\nsuperior to the common barometer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=46. The Water-glass Barometer.=--If a Florence flask, having a long neck,\r\nhave a small quantity of water poured into it, and then be inverted and so\r\nsupported that the open end dips into a vessel containing water, a small\r\ncolumn of water will be confined in the neck of the bottle, the pressure\r\nof which, upon the surface of the exposed water, will be equal to the\r\ndifference between the atmospheric pressure and the elasticity of the\r\nconfined air in the body of the bottle. As the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nvaries, this column will alter in height. But the elasticity of the\r\nconfined air is also subject to variations, owing to changes of\r\ntemperature. It follows, then, that the oscillations of the column are\r\ndependent on alterations of temperature and atmospheric pressure. Such an\r\narrangement has been called \"the Water-glass Barometer,\" and bears about\r\nthe same relative value to the mercurial barometer, as an exponent of\r\nweather changes, that a cat-gut hygrometer bears to a thermometric\r\nhygrometer, as an indicator of relative moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n47. SYMPIESOMETER.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the instrument now about to be described, depending upon\r\nsimilar principles, but scientifically constructed and graduated, is a\r\nvery useful and valuable substitute for the mercurial barometer. It\r\nconsists of a glass tube, varying, according to the purposes for which the\r\ninstrument is required, from six to twenty-four inches in length. The\r\nupper end is closed, and formed into a bulb; the lower is turned up,\r\nformed into a cistern, and open at top, through a pipette, or cone. A\r\nplug, moveable by a catch from below, can be made to close this opening,\r\nso as to render the instrument portable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the tube is filled with air; the lower portion, and\r\npart of the cistern, with sulphuric acid, coloured so as to render it\r\nplainly visible. Formerly, hydrogen and oil were used. It was found,\r\nhowever, that, by the process known to chemists as _osmosis_, this light\r\ngas in time partially escaped, and the remainder became mixed with air,\r\nthe consequence being that the graduations were no longer correct. They\r\nare more durable as at present constructed. The liquid rises and falls in\r\nthe tube with the variations of atmospheric pressure and temperature\r\nacting together. If the pressure were constant, the confined air would\r\nexpand and contract for temperature only, and the instrument would act as\r\na thermometer. In fact, the instrument is regarded as such in the\r\nmanufacture; and the thermometric scales are ascertained and engraved on\r\nthe scale. A good mercurial thermometer is also mounted on the same frame.\r\nIf, therefore, at any time the mercurial and the air thermometers do not\r\nread alike, it must evidently be due to the atmospheric pressure acting\r\nupon the air in the tube; and it is further evident that, under these\r\ncircumstances, the position of the top of the liquid may be marked to\r\nrepresent the barometric pressure at the time. In this manner a scale of\r\npressure is ascertained by comparison with a standard barometer, extending\r\ngenerally from 27 to 31 inches.\r\n\r\nWhen made correctly, these instruments agree well with the mercurial\r\nbarometer for a number of years, and their subsequent adjustment is not a\r\nmatter of much expense.\r\n\r\nFor use at sea, the liquid column is contracted at the bend. The\r\nsympiesometer is very sensitive, and feels the alterations in the\r\natmospheric pressure sooner than the ordinary marine barometer.\r\n\r\nThe scale is usually on silvered brass, mounted on a mahogany or rosewood\r\nframe, protected in front by plate glass. It is generally furnished with a\r\nrevolving register, to record the observation, in order that it may be\r\nknown whether the pressure has increased or decreased in the interval of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nSmall pocket sympiesometers are sometimes fitted with ivory scales, and\r\nprotected by a neat velvet-lined pasteboard or morocco case.\r\n\r\n_How to take an Observation._--In practice, the indications of the\r\natmospheric pressure are obtained from the sympiesometer by noting, first,\r\nthe temperature of the mercurial thermometer; secondly, adjusting the\r\npointer of the pressure scale to the same degree of temperature on the\r\nscale of the air column; thirdly, reading the height of the liquid on the\r\nsliding scale.\r\n\r\n_Directions for Use._--The sympiesometer should be carried and handled so\r\nas to keep the top always upwards, to prevent the air mechanically mixing\r\nwith the liquid. Care should also be taken to screen it from casual rays\r\nof the sun or cabin fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n48. ANEROIDS.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful and highly ingenious instrument called by the name\r\n_Aneroid_, is no less remarkable for the scientific principles of its\r\nconstruction and action, than for the nicety of its mechanism. It is a\r\nsubstitute, and perhaps the best of all substitutes, for the mercurial\r\nbarometer. As its name implies, it is constructed \"without fluid.\" It was\r\ninvented by M. Vidi of Paris. In the general form in which it is made it\r\nconsists of a brass cylindrical case about four inches in diameter and one\r\nand a half inch deep, faced with a dial graduated and marked similarly to\r\nthe dial-plate of a \"wheel-barometer,\" upon which the index or pointer\r\nshows the atmospheric pressure in inches and decimals of an inch in\r\naccordance with the mercurial barometer. Within the case, for ordinary\r\nsizes, is placed a flat metal box, generally not more than half an inch\r\nthick and about two inches or a little more in diameter, from which nearly\r\nall the air is exhausted. The top and bottom of this box is corrugated in\r\nconcentric circles, so as to yield inwardly to external pressure, and\r\nreturn when the pressure is removed. The pressure of the atmosphere,\r\nacting externally, continually changes, while the elastic pressure of the\r\nsmall quantity of air within can only vary by its volume being increased\r\nor decreased, or by change of temperature. Leaving out of consideration,\r\nfor the moment, the effect of temperature, we can readily perceive that as\r\nthe pressure is lessened upon the outside of the box, the elastic force of\r\nthe air within will force out the top and bottom of the box; and when the\r\nouter pressure is increased they will be forced in. Thus with the varying\r\npressure of the atmosphere, the top and bottom of the box approach to and\r\nrecede from each other by a small quantity; but the bottom being fixed,\r\nnearly all this motion takes place on the top. Thus the top of the box is\r\nlike an elastic cushion, which rises and falls according as the\r\ncompressing force lessens or increases. To the eye these expansions and\r\ncontractions would not be perceptible, so small is the motion. But they\r\nare rendered very evident by a nice mechanical arrangement. To the box is\r\nattached a strong piece of iron, kept pressed upon it by a spring at one\r\nextremity; so that as the top of the box rises, the motion is made\r\nsensible at the point held by the spring, and when the top descends the\r\nspring draws the piece of iron into close contact with it. This piece of\r\niron acts as a lever, having its fulcrum at one extremity, the power at\r\nthe centre of the box-top, and the other extremity controlled by the\r\nspring. Thus it is evident that the small motion of the centre of the\r\nbox-top is much increased at the spring extremity. The motion thus\r\nobtained is communicated to a system of levers; and, by the intervention\r\nof a piece of watch-chain and a fine spring passing round the arbour,\r\nturns the index to the right or left, according as the external pressure\r\nincreases or decreases. Thus, when by increase of pressure the vacuum box\r\nis compressed, the mechanism transfers the movement to the index, and it\r\nmoves to the right; when the vacuum box bulges out under diminished\r\npressure, the mechanical motion is reversed, and the index moves to the\r\nleft. As the index traverses the dial, it shows upon the scale the\r\npressure corresponding with that which a good mercurial barometer would at\r\nthe same time and place indicate; that is, supposing it correctly\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nA different and more elegant arrangement has since been adopted. A broad\r\ncurved spring is connected to the top of the vacuum box, so as to be\r\ncompressed by the top of the box yielding inward to increased pressure,\r\nand to relax itself and the box as the pressure is lessened. The system of\r\nlevers is connected to this spring, which augments and transfers the\r\nmotion to the index, in the manner already described. Increase of pressure\r\ncauses the levers to slacken the piece of watch-chain connected with them\r\nand the arbour of the index. The spring now uncoils, winds the chain upon\r\nthe arbour, and turns the index to the right. Decrease of pressure winds\r\nthe chain off the barrel, tightens the spiral spring, which thus turns the\r\nindex to the left. The graduations of the aneroid scale are obtained by\r\ncomparisons with the correct standard reading of a mercurial barometer,\r\nunder the normal and reduced atmospheric pressure. Reduced pressure is\r\nobtained by placing both instruments under the receiver of an air pump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\nFig. 33 represents the latest improved mechanism of an aneroid. The outer\r\ncase and the face of the instrument are removed, but the hand is attached\r\nby its collet to the arbour. _A_ is the corrugated box, which has been\r\nexhausted of air through the tube, _J_, and hermetically sealed by\r\nsoldering. _B_ is a powerful curved spring, resting in gudgeons fixed on\r\nthe frame-plate, and attached to a socket behind, _F_, in the top of the\r\nbox. A lever, _C_, joined to the stout edge of the spring, is connected,\r\nby the bent lever at _D_, with the chain, _E_, the other end of which is\r\ncoiled round, and fastened to the arbour, _F_. As the box, _A_, is\r\ncompressed by the weight of the atmosphere increasing, the spring, _B_, is\r\ntightened, the lever, _C_, depressed, and the chain, _E_, uncoiled from\r\n_F_, which is thereby turned so that the hand, _H_, moves to the right. In\r\nthe mean while the spiral spring, _G_, coiled round _F_, and fixed at one\r\nextremity to the frame-work and by the other to _F_, is compressed. When,\r\ntherefore, the pressure decreases, _A_ and _B_ relax, by virtue of their\r\nelasticity; _E_ slackens, _G_ unwinds, turning _F_, which carries _H_ to\r\nthe left. Near _J_ is shown an iron pillar, cast as part of the stock of\r\nthe spring, _B_. A screw works in this pillar through the bottom of the\r\nplate, by means of which the spring, _B_, may be so adjusted to the box,\r\n_A_, as to set the hand, _H_, to read on the scale according to the\r\nindications of a mercurial barometer. The lever, _C_, is composed of brass\r\nand steel, soldered together, and adjusted by repeated trials to correct\r\nfor the effects of temperature.\r\n\r\nA thermometer is sometimes attached to the aneroid, as it is convenient\r\nfor indicating the temperature of the air. As regards the instrument\r\nitself, no correction for temperature can be applied with certainty. It\r\nshould be set to read with the mercurial barometer at 32 deg. F. Then the\r\nreadings from it are supposed to require no correction.\r\n\r\nIn considering the effects of temperature upon the aneroid, they are found\r\nto be somewhat complex. There is the effect of expansion and contraction\r\nof the various metals of which the mechanism is composed; and there is the\r\neffect on the elasticity of the small portion of air in the box. An\r\nincrease of temperature produces greater, a diminution less elasticity in\r\nthis air. The compensation for effects of temperature is adjusted by the\r\nprocess of \"trial and error,\" and only a few makers do it well. It is very\r\noften a mere sham. Admiral FitzRoy writes, in his _Barometer Manual_, \"The\r\nknown expansion and contraction of metals under varying temperatures,\r\ncaused doubts as to the accuracy of the aneroid under such changes; but\r\nthey were partly removed by introducing into the vacuum box a small\r\nportion of gas, as a compensation for the effects of heat or cold. The gas\r\nin the box, changing its bulk on a change of temperature, was intended to\r\ncompensate for the effect on the metals of which the aneroid is made.\r\nBesides which, a further and more reliable compensation has lately been\r\neffected by a combination of brass and steel bars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aneroid barometers, if often compared with good mercurial columns, are\r\nsimilar in their indications, and valuable; but it must be remembered that\r\nthey are not independent instruments, that they are set originally by a\r\nbarometer, require adjustment occasionally, and may deteriorate in time,\r\nthough slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The aneroid is quick in showing the variation of atmospheric pressure;\r\nand to the navigator who knows the difficulty, at times, of using\r\nbarometers, this instrument is a great boon, for it can be placed\r\nanywhere, quite out of harm's way, and is not affected by the ship's\r\nmotion, although faithfully giving indication of increased or diminished\r\npressure of air. In ascending or descending elevations, the hand of the\r\naneroid may be seen to move (like the hand of a watch), showing the height\r\nabove the level of the sea, or the difference of level between places of\r\ncomparison.\"\r\n\r\nIn the admiral's _Notes on Meteorology_, he says, \"The aneroid is an\r\nexcellent _weather glass_, if well made. Compensation for heat or cold has\r\nlately been introduced by efficient mechanism. In its _improved_\r\ncondition, when the cost may be about L5, it is fit for measuring heights\r\nas far as 5,000 feet with approximate accuracy; but even at the price of\r\nL3, as a _weather-glass_ only, it is exceedingly valuable, because it can\r\nbe carried anywhere; and if now and then compared with a good barometer,\r\nit may be relied on sufficiently. I have had one in constant use for ten\r\nyears, and it appears to be as good now as at first. For a ship of war\r\n(considering concussion by the fire of guns), for boats, or to put in a\r\ndrawer, or on a table, I believe there is nothing better than it for use\r\nas a common weather-glass.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Sir H. James, R.E., in his _Instructions for taking Meteorological\r\nObservations_, says of the aneroid, \"This is a most valuable instrument;\r\nit is extremely portable. I have had one in use for upwards of ten years,\r\nand find it to be the best form of barometer, as a \"weather-glass,\" that\r\nhas been made.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the objects of Mr. Glaisher's experiments in balloons was \"to\r\ncompare the readings of an aneroid barometer with those of a mercurial\r\nbarometer up to five miles.\" In the comparisons the readings of the\r\nmercurial barometer were corrected for index-error and temperature. The\r\naneroid readings, says Mr. Glaisher, \"prove all the observations made in\r\nthe several ascents may be safely depended upon, and also that an aneroid\r\nbarometer can be made to read correctly to pressures below twelve inches.\"\r\nAs one of the general conclusions derived from his experiments he states,\r\n\"that an aneroid barometer read correctly to the first place, and probably\r\nto the second place of decimals, to a pressure as low as seven inches.\"\r\nThe two aneroids used by Mr. Glaisher were by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra.\r\n\r\nAneroids are now manufactured almost perfectly compensated for\r\ntemperature. Such an instrument therefore ought to show the same pressure\r\nin the external air at a temperature say of 40 deg., as it would in a room\r\nwhere the temperature at the same time may be 60 deg.; provided there is no\r\ndifference of elevation. To test it thoroughly would require an\r\nexamination and a comparison with barometer readings reduced to 32 deg. F.,\r\nconducted through a long range of temperature and under artificially\r\nreduced pressure. A practical method appears to be to compare the aneroid\r\ndaily, or more often, for a few weeks with the readings of a mercurial\r\nbarometer reduced to 32 deg.; and if the error so found be constant, the\r\nobject of the compensation may be assumed to be attained, particularly if\r\nthe temperature during the period has varied greatly.\r\n\r\n_Directions for using the Aneroid._--Aneroids are generally suspended with\r\nthe dial vertical; but if they be placed with the dial horizontal, the\r\nindications differ a few hundredths of an inch in the two positions.\r\nHence, if their indications are registered, they should be kept in the\r\nsame position.\r\n\r\nThe aneroid will not answer for exact scientific purposes, as it cannot be\r\nrelied upon for a length of time. Its error of indication changes slowly,\r\nand hence the necessity of its being set from time to time with the\r\nreading of a good barometer. To allow of this being done, at the back of\r\nthe outer case is the head of a screw in connection with the spring\r\nattached to the vacuum box. By applying a small turnscrew to this screw,\r\nthe spring of the vacuum box may be tightened or relaxed, and the index\r\nmade to move correspondingly to the right or left on the dial. By this\r\nmeans, besides being enabled to correct the aneroid at any time, \"if the\r\nmeasure of a height rather greater than the aneroid will commonly show be\r\nrequired, it may be _re-set_ thus: When at the upper station (_within its\r\nrange_), and having noted the reading carefully, touch the screw behind so\r\nas to bring back the hand a few inches (if the instrument will admit),\r\nthen read off and start again. _Reverse the operation when descending._\r\nThis may add some inches of measure _approximately_.\"--_FitzRoy._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\n=49. Small Size Aneroids.=--The patent for the Aneroid having expired,\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy urged upon Messrs. Negretti & Zambra the desirability of\r\nreducing the size at which it had hitherto been made, as well as of\r\nimproving its mechanical arrangement, and compensation for temperature.\r\nThey accordingly engaged skilful workmen, who, under their directions, and\r\nat their expense, by a great amount of labour and experiment, succeeded\r\nin reducing its dimensions to two inches in diameter, and an inch and a\r\nquarter thick. The exact size and appearance of this aneroid are shown in\r\nfig. 34. The compensation is carefully adjusted, and the graduations of\r\nthe dial ascertained under reduced pressure, so that they are not quite\r\nequal, but more accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=50. Watch Aneroid.=--Subsequently the aneroid has been further reduced in\r\nsize and it can now be had from an inch and a quarter to six inches in\r\ndiameter. The smallest size can be enclosed in watch cases, fig. 35, or\r\notherwise, so as to be adapted to the pocket. By a beautifully simple\r\ncontrivance, a milled rim is adjusted to move round with hand pressure,\r\nand carry a fine index or pointer, outside and around the scale engraved\r\non the dial, or face, for the purpose of marking the reading, so that the\r\nsubsequent increase or decrease of pressure may be readily seen. These\r\nvery small instruments are found to act quite as correctly as the largest,\r\nand are much more serviceable. Besides serving the purpose of a\r\nweather-glass in the house or away from home, if carried in the pocket,\r\nthey are admirably suited to the exigencies of tourists and travellers.\r\nThey may be had with scale sufficient to measure heights not exceeding\r\n8,000 feet; with a scale of elevation in feet, as well as of pressure in\r\ninches, engraved on the dial. The scale of elevation, which is for the\r\ntemperature of 50 deg., was computed by Professor Airy, the Astronomer Royal,\r\nwho kindly presented it to Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, at the same time\r\nsuggesting its application. Moderate-sized aneroids, fitted in leathern\r\nsling cases, are also good travelling instruments, and will be found\r\nserviceable to pilots, fishermen, and for use in coasting and small\r\nvessels, where a mercurial barometer cannot be employed, because requiring\r\ntoo much space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy, in a communication to the _Mercantile Marine Magazine_,\r\nDecember, 1860, says:--\"Aneroids are now made more portable, so that a\r\npilot or chief boatman may carry one in his pocket, as a railway guard\r\ncarries his timekeeper; and, thus provided, pilots cruising for expected\r\nships would be able to caution strangers arriving, if bad weather were\r\nimpending, or give warning to coasters or fishing boats. Harbours of\r\nRefuge, however excellent and important, are not always accessible, even\r\nwhen most wanted, as in snow, rain, or darkness, when neither land, nor\r\nbuoy, nor even a lighthouse-light can be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=51. Measurement of Heights by the Aneroid.=--For measuring heights not\r\nexceeding many hundred feet above the sea-level by means of the aneroid,\r\nthe following simple method will suffice:--\r\n\r\nDivide the difference between the aneroid readings at the lower and upper\r\nstations by .0011; the quotient will give the approximate height in feet.\r\n\r\nThus, supposing the aneroid to read at the\r\n\r\n  Lower Station                30.385 inches.\r\n  Upper Station                30.025\r\n                               ------\r\n                Difference       .360\r\n                               ======\r\n\r\n  Divided gives .360/.0011 = 327 feet.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the mode in which the aneroid should be used in\r\nmeasuring heights, the following example is given:--\r\n\r\nA gentleman who ascended Helvellyn, August 12th, 1862, recorded the\r\nfollowing observations with a pocket aneroid by Negretti and Zambra:--\r\n\r\nNear 10 a.m., at the first milestone from Ambleside, found by survey to be\r\n188 feet above the sea, the aneroid read 29.89 inches; about 1 p.m., at\r\nthe summit of Helvellyn, 26.81; and at 5 p.m., at the milestone again,\r\n29.76. The temperature of the lower air was 57 deg., of the upper, 54 deg. Hence\r\nthe height of the mountain is deduced as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                          Inches.\r\n\r\n  Reading at 10 a.m.                       29.89\r\n        \"     5 p.m.                       29.76\r\n                                           ------\r\n              Mean                         29.825 Table I.[5]   1010\r\n  Upper Reading                            26.81     \"          3796\r\n                                                               -----\r\n                   Difference                                   2786\r\n  Mean Temperature 55 deg.5, gives in Table II.                   1.048\r\n                                                               -----\r\n                                                                2920\r\n  Lat. 55 deg.

Herschell's _Physical Geography_ it is given as     3115 ft.\r\n\r\nSo near an agreement is attributable to the excellence of the aneroid, and\r\nthe careful accuracy of the observer.\r\n\r\n\r\n52. METALLIC BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nThis instrument, the invention of M. Bourdon, has a great resemblance to\r\nthe aneroid, but is much simpler in arrangement. The inventor has applied\r\nthe same principle to the construction of metallic steam-pressure gauges.\r\nWe are here, however, only concerned with it as constructed to indicate\r\natmospheric pressure. It consists of a long slender flattened metallic\r\ntube, partially exhausted of air, and hermetically closed at each end,\r\nthen fixed upon its centre, and bent round so as to make the ends face\r\neach other. The transverse section of this tube is an elongated ellipse.\r\nThe principle of action is this: interior pressure tends to straighten the\r\ntube, external pressure causes it to coil more. Hence as the atmospheric\r\npressure decreases, the ends of the tube become more apart.\r\n\r\nThis movement is augmented and transferred by a mechanical arrangement of\r\nsmall metallic levers to a radius bar, which carries a rack formed on the\r\narc of its circle. This moves a pinion, upon the arbour of which a light\r\npointer, or \"hand,\" is poised, which indicates the pressure upon a dial.\r\nWhen the pressure increases, the ends of the tube approach each other, and\r\nthe pointer moves from left to right over the dial. The whole mechanism is\r\nfixed in a brass case, having a hole at the back for adjusting the\r\ninstrument to the mercurial barometer by means of a key, which sets the\r\npointer without affecting the levers. The dial is generally open to show\r\nthe mechanism, and is protected by a glass, to which is fitted a moveable\r\nindex.\r\n\r\nThis barometer is very sensitive, and has the advantage of occupying\r\nlittle space, although it has not yet been made so small as the aneroid.\r\nBoth these instruments admit of a great variety of mounts to render them\r\nornamental. The metallic barometer can be constructed with a small clock\r\nin its centre, so as to form a novel and beautiful drawing-room ornament.\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy writes, \"Metallic barometers, by Bourdon, have not yet\r\nbeen tested in very moist, hot, or cold air for a sufficient time. They\r\nare dependent, or secondary instruments, and liable to deterioration. For\r\nlimited employment, when sufficiently compared, they may be very useful,\r\nespecially in a few cases of electrical changes, _not foretold or shown by\r\nmercury_, which these seem to indicate remarkably.\"\r\n\r\nThey are not so well adapted for travellers, nor for measurements of\r\nconsiderable elevations, as aneroids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS FOR ASCERTAINING TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=53. Temperature= is the energy with which heat affects our sensation of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nBodies are said to possess the same temperature, when the amounts of heat\r\nwhich they respectively contain act outwardly with the same intensity of\r\ntransfer or absorption, producing in the one case the sensation of warmth,\r\nin the other that of coldness. Instruments used for the determination and\r\nestimation of temperatures are called _Thermometers_.\r\n\r\nExperience proves that the same body always occupies the same space at the\r\nsame temperature; and that for every increase or decrease of its\r\ntemperature, it undergoes a definite dilatation or contraction of its\r\nvolume. Provided, then, a body suffers no loss of substance or peculiar\r\nchange of its constituent elements or atoms, while manifesting changes of\r\ntemperature it will likewise exhibit alterations in volume; the latter\r\nmay, therefore, be taken as exponents of the former. The expansion and\r\ncontraction of bodies are adopted as arbitrary measures of changes of\r\ntemperature; and any substance will serve for a thermometer in which these\r\nchanges of volume are sensible, and can be rendered measureable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=54. Thermometric Substances.=--Thermometers for meteorological and\r\ndomestic purposes are constructed with liquids, and generally either\r\nmercury or alcohol, because their alterations of volume for the same\r\nchange of temperature are greater than those of solids; while being more\r\nmanageable, they are preferred to gases. Mercury is of all substances the\r\nbest adapted for thermometric purposes, as it maintains the liquid state\r\nthrough a great alteration of heat, has a more equable co-efficient of\r\nexpansion than any other fluid, and is peculiarly sensitive to changes of\r\ntemperature. The temperature of solidification of mercury, according to\r\nFahrenheit's scale of temperature, is -40 deg.; and its temperature of\r\nebullition is about 600 deg. Sulphuric ether, nitric acid, oil of sassafras,\r\nand other limpid fluids, have been employed for thermometers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=55. Description of the Thermometer.=--The ordinary thermometer consists\r\nof a glass tube of very fine bore, having a bulb of thin glass at one\r\nextremity, and closed at the other. The bulb and part of the tube contains\r\nmercury; the rest of the tube is a vacuum, and affords space for the\r\nexpansion of the liquid. This arrangement renders very perceptible the\r\nalterations in volume of the mercury due to changes of temperature. It is\r\ntrue, the glass expands and contracts also; but only by about\r\none-twentieth of the extent of the mercury. Regarding the bulb, then, as\r\nunalterable in size, all the changes in the bulk of the fluid must take\r\nplace in the tube, and be exhibited by the expansion and contraction of\r\nthe column, which variations are made to measure changes of temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n56. STANDARD THERMOMETER.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities in the construction of thermometers will be best\r\nunderstood by describing the manufacture of a _Standard Thermometer_,\r\nwhich is one of the most accurate make, and the scale of which is divided\r\nindependently of any comparison with another thermometer. Fig. 36 is an\r\nillustration of such an instrument, on a silvered brass scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36]\r\n\r\n_Selection of Tube._--In selecting the glass tube, much care is requisite\r\nto ascertain that its bore is perfectly uniform throughout. As received\r\nfrom the glass-house, the tubes are generally, in their interior, portions\r\nof very elongated cones, so that the bore is wider at one end than at the\r\nother. With due care, however, a proper length of tube can be selected, in\r\nwhich there is no appreciable difference of bore. This is ascertained by\r\nintroducing into the tube a length of mercury of about a half or a third\r\nof an inch, and accurately measuring it in various positions in the tube.\r\nTo accomplish this, the workman blows a bulb at one end of the tube, and\r\nheats the bulb a little to drive out some of the air. Then, placing the\r\nopen end in mercury, upon cooling the elasticity of the enclosed air\r\ndiminishes, and the superior pressure of the atmosphere drives in some\r\nmercury. The workman stops the process so soon as he judges sufficient\r\nmercury has entered. By cooling or heating the bulb, as necessary, the\r\nmercury is made to pass from one end of the tube to the other. Should the\r\nlength of this portion of mercury alter in various parts of the bore, the\r\ntube must be rejected. If it is, as nearly as possible, one uniform\r\nlength, the tube is set aside for filling.\r\n\r\nThe _bulb_ is never blown by the breath, but by an elastic caoutchouc ball\r\ncontaining air, so that the introduction of moisture is avoided. The\r\nspherical form is to be preferred; for it is best adapted to resist the\r\nvarying pressure of the atmosphere. The bulbs should not be too large, or\r\nthe mercury will take some time to indicate sudden changes of temperature.\r\nCylindrical bulbs are sometimes desirable, as they offer larger surfaces\r\nto the mercury, and enable thermometers to be made more sensitive.\r\n\r\nThe _mercury_, with which the bulb is to be filled, should be quite pure,\r\nand freed from moisture and air by recent boiling.\r\n\r\n_Filling the Tube._--The filling is effected by heating the bulb with the\r\nflame of a spirit-lamp, while the open end is embedded in mercury. Upon\r\nallowing the bulb to cool, the atmospheric pressure drives some mercury\r\ninto it; and the process of heating and cooling is thus continued until\r\nsufficient mercury is introduced. The mercury is next boiled in the tube,\r\nto expel any air or moisture that may be present. In order to close the\r\ntube and exclude all air, the artist ascertains that the tube contains\r\nthe requisite quantity of mercury; then, by holding the bulb over the\r\nspirit flame, he causes the mercury to fill the whole of the tube, and\r\ndexterously removing it from the source of heat, he, at the same instant,\r\ncloses it with the flame of a blow-pipe. If any air remain in the tube, it\r\nis easily detected; for if the instrument be inverted, the mercury will\r\nfall to the extremity of the tube, if there is a perfect vacuum, unless\r\nthe tube be so finely capillary that its attraction for the mercury is\r\nsufficient to overcome the force of gravity, in which case the mercury\r\nwill retain its position in every situation of the instrument. If,\r\nhowever, the mercury fall and does not reach quite to the extremity of the\r\nbore, some air is present, which must be removed.\r\n\r\n_The Graduation._--The thermometer is now prepared for graduation, the\r\nfirst part of which process is the determination of two fixed points.\r\nThese are given by the temperatures of melting ice and of the vapour of\r\nboiling water. Melting ice has always the same temperature in every place\r\nand under all circumstances; provided only that the water from which the\r\nice is congealed is free from salts. The temperature of the vapour of\r\nboiling water depends upon the pressure of the atmosphere, but is always\r\nconstant for the same pressure.\r\n\r\nThe fixed point corresponding to the temperature of melting ice is called\r\nthe _freezing point_. It is obtained by keeping the bulb and the part of\r\nthe tube occupied by mercury immersed in melting ice, until the mercury\r\ncontracts to a certain point, where it remains stationary. This position\r\nof the end of the mercury is then marked upon the tube.\r\n\r\nThe _boiling point_ is not so easily determined, for the barometer must be\r\nconsulted about the same time. The boiling apparatus is generally\r\nconstructed of copper. It consists of a cylindrical boiler, heated from\r\nthe base by a spirit lamp or charcoal fire. An open tube two or three\r\ninches in diameter and of suitable length enters the top of the boiler.\r\nThis tube is enveloped by another fixed to the top of the boiler but not\r\nopening into it, and so that the two tubes are about an inch apart. The\r\nobject of the outer tube is to protect the inner tube from the cold\r\ntemperature of the air. The outer tube has an opening at the top for the\r\nadmission of the thermometer, and a hole near the bottom for the escape of\r\nsteam through a spout. When the water is made to boil, the steam rises in\r\nthe inner tube, fills the space between the tubes, and escapes at the\r\nspout. The thermometer is then passed down into the inner cylinder, and\r\nheld securely from the top by means of a piece of caoutchouc. The tubes or\r\ncylinders should be of sufficient length to prevent the thermometer\r\nentering the water. This is necessary because the temperature of boiling\r\nwater is influenced by any substance which it holds in chemical solution;\r\nand, moreover, its temperature increases with the depth, owing to the\r\npressure of the upper stratum. The thermometer being thus surrounded with\r\nsteam, the mercury rises in the tube. As it does so, the tube should be\r\ndepressed so as always to keep the top of the mercury just perceptible.\r\nWhen the temperature of the vapour is attained, the mercury ceases to\r\nrise, and remains stationary. The position of the end of the mercury is\r\nnow marked upon the tube, and the \"_boiling-point_\" is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=57. Methods of ascertaining the exact Boiling Temperature.=--The normal\r\nboiling temperature of water all nations have tacitly agreed to fix under\r\na normal barometric pressure of 29.922 inches of mercury, having the\r\ntemperature of melting ice, in the latitude of 45 deg., and at the sea-level.\r\nIf the atmospheric pressure at the time or place of graduating a\r\nthermometer does not equal this, the boiling temperature will be higher or\r\nlower according as the pressure is greater or less. Hence a reading must\r\nbe taken from a reliable barometer, which must also be corrected for\r\nerrors and temperature, and reduced for latitude, in order to compare the\r\nactual atmospheric pressure at the time with the assumed normal pressure.\r\nTables of vapour tension, as they are termed, have been computed from\r\naccurate experimental investigations and theory,--giving the temperatures\r\nof the vapour of water for all probable pressures; Regnault's, the most\r\nrecent, is considered the most accurate; and his investigations are based\r\nupon the standard pressure given above, and are for the same latitude. His\r\nTable, therefore, will give the temperature on the thermometric scale\r\ncorresponding to the pressure.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners appointed by the British Government to construct\r\nstandard weights and measures, decided that the normal boiling-point,\r\n212 deg., on the thermometer should represent the temperature of steam\r\ngenerated under an atmospheric pressure equal in inches of mercury, at the\r\ntemperature of freezing water, to 29.922 + (cos. 2 latitude x .0766) +\r\n(.00000179 x height in feet above the sea-level). Hence, at London, lat.\r\n51 deg.30' N., we deduce 29.905 as the barometric pressure representing the\r\nnormal boiling point of water,--the trifling correction due to height\r\nbeing neglected. If then, in the latitude of London, the barometric\r\npressure, at the time of fixing the boiling point, be not 29.905 inches,\r\nthat point will be higher or lower, according to the difference of the\r\npressure from the normal. Near the sea-level about 0.59 inch of such\r\ndifference is equivalent to 1 deg. Fahrenheit in the boiling point.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, the atmospheric pressure at London to be 30.785 inches, the\r\nfollowing calculation gives the corresponding boiling temperature for\r\nFahrenheit's scale:--\r\n\r\n  Observed pressure    30.785\r\n  Normal       \"       29.905\r\n                       ------\r\n  Difference             .880\r\n                      =======\r\n\r\nAs 0.59 is to 0.88, so is 1 deg. to 1 deg.5.\r\n\r\nThat is, the water boils at 1 deg.5 above its normal temperature; so that, in\r\nthis case, the normal temperature to be placed on the scale, viz. 212 deg.,\r\nmust be 1 deg.5 lower than the mark made on the tube at the height at which\r\nthe mercury stood under the influence of the boiling water.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the vapour of boiling water may be found, at any time\r\nand place, as follows:--Multiply the atmospheric pressure by the factor\r\ndue to the latitude, given in the annexed Table V., and with the result\r\nseek the temperature in Table VI.\r\n\r\n        TABLE V.

Displacement of the Freezing Point.=--Either the prolonged effect of\r\nthe atmospheric pressure upon the thin glass of the bulbs of thermometers,\r\nor the gradual restoration of the equilibrium of the particles of the\r\nglass after having been greatly disturbed by the operation of boiling the\r\nmercury, seems to be the cause of the freezing points of standard\r\nthermometers reading from a few tenths to a degree higher in the course of\r\nsome years, as has been repeatedly observed. To obviate this small error,\r\nit is our practice to place the tubes aside for about six months before\r\nfixing the freezing point, in order to give time for the glass to regain\r\nits former state of aggregation. The making of accurate thermometers is a\r\ntask attended with many difficulties, the principal one being the\r\nliability of the zero or freezing point varying constantly, so much so,\r\nthat a thermometer that is perfectly correct to-day, if immersed in\r\nboiling water, will be no longer accurate; at least, it will take some\r\ntime before it again settles into its normal state. Then, again, if a\r\nthermometer is recently blown, filled, and graduated immediately, or, at\r\nleast, before some months have elapsed, though every care may have been\r\ntaken with the production of the instrument, it will require some\r\ncorrection; so that the instrument, however carefully made, should from\r\ntime to time be plunged into finely-pounded ice, in order to verify the\r\nfreezing point.\r\n\r\n\r\n=59. The Scale.=--The two fixed points having been determined, it is\r\nnecessary to apply the scale. The thermometers in general use in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, the British Colonies, and North America are constructed\r\nwith Fahrenheit's scale. Fahrenheit was a philosophical instrument maker\r\nof Amsterdam, who, about the year 1724, invented the scale which has given\r\nhis name to the thermometer. The freezing point is marked 32 deg., the boiling\r\npoint 212 deg., so that the intermediate space is divided into 180 equal\r\nparts, called degrees. \"The principle which dictated this _peculiar\r\ndivision_ of the scale is as follows:--When the instrument stood at the\r\ngreatest cold of Iceland, or 0 degree, it was computed to contain 11124\r\nequal parts of quicksilver, which, when plunged in melting snow, expanded\r\nto 11156 parts; hence the intermediate space was divided into 32 equal\r\nportions, and 32 was taken as the freezing point of water: when the\r\nthermometer was plunged in boiling water, the quicksilver was expanded to\r\n11336; and therefore 212 deg. was marked as the boiling point of that fluid.\r\nIn _practice_, Fahrenheit determined the divisions of his scale from two\r\nfixed points, the freezing and boiling of water. _The theory_ of the\r\ndivision, if we may so speak, was derived from the lowest cold observed in\r\nIceland, and the expansions of a given portion of mercury\" (_Professor\r\nTrail_).\r\n\r\nThe divisions of the scale can be carried beyond the fixed points, if\r\nrequisite, by equal graduations. Fahrenheit's scale is very convenient in\r\nsome respects. The meteorological observer is seldom troubled with\r\nnegative signs, as the zero of the scale is much below freezing. Again,\r\nthe divisions are more numerous, and consequently smaller, than on other\r\nscales in use; and the further subdivision into tenths of degrees, seems\r\nto give all the minuteness usually required.\r\n\r\n_Celcius_, a Swede, in 1742, proposed zero for the freezing point, and 100\r\nfor the boiling point, all temperatures below zero being distinguishable\r\nby the sign (--) minus. This scale is known as the _centigrade_, and is in\r\nuse in France, Sweden, and the southern part of Europe. It has the\r\nadvantage of the decimal notation, with the embarrassment of the negative\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n_Reaumur_, a Frenchman, proposed zero for the freezing point, and 80 deg. for\r\nthe boiling point, an arrangement inferior to the centigrade. It is,\r\nhowever, in use in Spain, Switzerland, and Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is merely a simple arithmetical operation to change the indications of\r\nany one of these scales into the equivalents on the others. To facilitate\r\nsuch conversions, tables are convenient, when a large number of\r\nobservations are under discussion; and they can be easily formed or\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of such tables, the following formulae will insure accuracy\r\nof method, and save thinking, when occasional conversions are wanted to be\r\nmade:--F. stands for Fahrenheit, C. for Centigrade, and R. for Reaumur.\r\n\r\n  Given.

F.     =  9/5 R. + 32\r\n    R.        C.     =  5/4 R.\r\n\r\n_Example._--Convert 25 deg. of Fahrenheit's scale into the corresponding\r\ntemperature on the Centigrade scale.\r\n\r\n  Here C. = (25 - 32) 5/9\r\n       C. = -35/9 = -3.9\r\n\r\nor nearly 4 deg. _below_ zero of the Centigrade scale. The algebraical sign\r\nmust be carefully attended-to in the calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=60. The method of testing Thermometers= for meteorological purposes is\r\nvery simple. Such thermometers are seldom required to read above 120 deg. In\r\nthese the freezing point having been determined, the divisions of the\r\nscale are ascertained by careful comparisons, with a standard thermometer,\r\nin water of the requisite temperature. \"For the freezing point, the bulbs,\r\nand a considerable portion of the tubes of the thermometers, are immersed\r\nin pounded ice. For the higher temperatures, the thermometers are placed\r\nin a cylindrical glass vessel containing water of the required heat: the\r\nscales of the thermometers intended to be tested, together with the\r\nStandard with which they are to be compared, are read through the glass.\r\nIn this way the scale readings may be tested at any required degree of\r\ntemperature, and the usual practice is to test them at every ten degrees\r\nfrom 32 deg. to 92 deg. of Fahrenheit.\"--_FitzRoy._\r\n\r\n\r\n=61. Porcelain Scale Plates.=--Thermometer scales of brass, wood, or\r\nivory, either by atmospheric influence or dipping in sea-water, are very\r\nliable to become soiled and discoloured, so much so that after a very\r\nlittle time the divisions are rendered nearly invisible. To obviate this\r\ninconvenience, Messrs. Negretti and Zambra were the first to introduce\r\ninto extensive use thermometer and barometer scale-plates made of\r\nporcelain, having the divisions and figures engraved thereon by means of\r\nfluoric acid, and permanently burnt-in and blackened, so as always to\r\npresent a clear legible scale. That these scales have been found superior\r\nto all others, may be inferred from the fact that all the thermometers now\r\nsupplied to the various government departments are provided with such\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nThey can be adapted to replace any of the old forms of brass or zinc\r\nscales, the divisions and figures of which have become obliterated or\r\nindistinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n=62. Enamelled Tubes.=--Nearly all thermometer tubes are now made with\r\nenamelled backs. This contrivance of enamelling the backs of the tubes\r\nenables the makers to use finer threads of mercury than had before been\r\nfound practicable; for were it not for the great contrast between the dark\r\nthread of mercury and the white enamel on the glass, many of the\r\nthermometers now in use would be positively illegible. The enamelling of\r\nthermometers is an invention of Messrs. Negretti and Zambra. It is\r\nnecessary to state this, as many persons, from interested motives, are\r\nanxious to ignore to whom the credit of the invention is due.\r\n\r\n\r\n=63. Thermometers of extreme Sensitiveness.=--Thermometers for delicate\r\nexperiments are no novelty. Thermometers have been made with very delicate\r\nbulbs to contain a very small quantity of mercury. Such instruments have\r\nalso been made with spiral or coiled tubular bulbs, but the thickness of\r\nglass required to keep these coils or spirals in shape, and in fact to\r\nprevent their falling to pieces, served to nullify the effect sought to be\r\nproduced, viz. instantaneous action; and where a small thin bulb was\r\nemployed, the indicating column was generally so fine that it was\r\npositively invisible except by the aid of a powerful lens. Messrs.\r\nNegretti and Zambra have now introduced a new form of thermometer, which\r\ncombines sensitiveness and quickness of action, together with a good\r\nvisible column. The bulb of this thermometer is of the gridiron form. Care\r\nhas been taken in constructing the bulb, so that the objections attending\r\nspirals and other forms have been overcome; for whilst the reservoir or\r\nbulb is made of glass so thin that it is only by a spirit lamp and not a\r\nglass blower's blowpipe that it can be formed, yet it is still so rigid\r\n(owing to its peculiar configuration) that no variations in its\r\nindications can be detected, whether it be held in a horizontal, vertical,\r\nor oblique position, nor will any error be detected if it be stood on its\r\nown bulb. They have made thermometers with bulbs or reservoirs formed of\r\nabout nine inches of excessively thin cylindrical glass, whose outer\r\ndiameter is not more than a twentieth of an inch; so that, owing to the\r\nlarge surface presented, the indications are positively instantaneous.\r\nThis form of thermometer was constructed expressly to meet the\r\nrequirements of scientific balloon ascents, to enable thermometrical\r\nreadings to be taken at the precise elevation. It was contemplated to\r\nprocure a metallic thermometer, but on the production of this perfect\r\ninstrument the idea was abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n64.

Superheated Steam Thermometer.=--The great advantage gained by the\r\nuse of superheated steam in marine and other steam-engines being now\r\ngenerally admitted by engineers, reliable thermometers, reading to 600 deg. at\r\nleast, are of the utmost importance. To meet this want, Messrs. Negretti\r\nand Zambra have constructed for the purpose a substantial form of\r\nthermometer, on their patent porcelain scales, in strong and convenient\r\nmetal mountings, with perforated protection to the bulb. The scales cannot\r\nbe deteriorated by steam, heat, oil, or dirt; and an occasional wiping\r\nwill be all that is necessary to keep the divisions and figures clean and\r\nvisible for any length of time; while careful calibration of the\r\nthermometer tubes ensures the most accurate indications attainable. These\r\nthermometers are illustrated by figs. 49 & 50. A similar, but cheaper,\r\nconstruction is given to thermometers to be used with hot air, or hot\r\nwater, apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=66. Thermometer for Sugar Boiling= is protected by a metallic frame; and\r\nis usually from three to four feet long, the graduations being confined to\r\na space of about twelve inches at the upper part of the instrument,\r\nallowing the bulb and greater part of the tube to be immersed in the\r\nboiling sugar. The graduations extend to 270 deg. or further. An index is\r\nsometimes attached to the scale, which may be set to any degree of heat\r\nrequired to be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n67. EARTH THERMOMETER.\r\n\r\nThe Earth Thermometer is for ascertaining the temperature of the soil at\r\nvarious depths. It is protected by a brass frame, pointed and strengthened\r\nat the end to facilitate insertion into the ground, as in fig. 51.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\n_Utility of a Knowledge of the Temperature of the Soil._--The temperature\r\nof the soil is an important element in the consideration of climate, as it\r\nconcerns the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nDr. Daubeny, in his _Lectures on Climate_, gives the following statement\r\nwith respect to some temperatures which have been observed just beneath\r\nthe earth's surface, in different parts of the globe:--\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     Country.      |          Temperature.          |   Authority.\r\n  -----------------+--------------------------------------------------\r\n  Tropics, often   |162-184 deg.                        | Humboldt.\r\n                   |                                |\r\n  Egypt            |133-144                         | Edwards & Colin.\r\n                   |                                |\r\n  Orinoco          |In white sand, 140              | Humboldt.\r\n                   |                                |\r\n  Chili            |113-118, among dry grass        | Boussingault.\r\n                   |                                |\r\n  Cape of Good Hope|150, under the soil of a bulb   | Herschell.\r\n                      garden                        |\r\n                   |                                |\r\n  Bermuda          |142, thermometer barely covered | Emmet.\r\n                   |  in earth                      |\r\n                   |                                |\r\n  China            |Water of the fields, 113;       | Meyer.\r\n                   |  adjacent sand, much higher;   |\r\n                   |  blackened sides of the boat   |\r\n                   |  at midday, 142-150            |\r\n                   |                                |\r\n  France           |118-122, and in one instance 127| Arago.\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\"The importance of this to vegetation may be estimated by the following\r\nconsiderations:--\r\n\r\n\"It is known that every plant requires a certain amount of heat, varying\r\nin the case of each species, for the renewal of its growth, at the\r\ncommencement of the season.\r\n\r\n\"Now when this degree of heat has spurred into activity those parts that\r\nare above ground, and caused them to elaborate the sap, it is necessary\r\nthat the subterranean portions should at the same time be excited by the\r\nheat of the ground to absorb the materials which are to supply the plant\r\nwith nourishment. Unless the latter function is provided for, the aerial\r\nportions of the plant will languish from want of food to assimilate.\r\nIndeed, it is even advisable that the roots should take the start of the\r\nleaves, in order to have in readiness a store of food for the latter to\r\ndraw upon.\" In another place the professor remarks:--\"It has been\r\ncalculated by Mr. Raikes, from experiments made at Chat Moss, that the\r\ntemperature of the soil when drained averages 10 deg. more than it does when\r\nundrained; and this is not surprising, when we find that 1 lb. of water\r\nevaporated from 1,000 lbs. of soil will depress the whole by 10 deg., owing to\r\nthe latent heat which it absorbs in its conversion into vapour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n68. MARINE THERMOMETER.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is a special construction to meet the requirements of\r\nnavigation. It consists of a carefully constructed thermometer divided on\r\nits stem to degrees, which are sufficiently large to admit of subdivision\r\ninto tenths of degrees by estimation, and ranging from 0 deg. to 130 deg. The\r\nscale is porcelain, having the degrees etched upon it, and burnt-in a\r\npermanent black. The instrument is made to slide into a japanned metallic\r\ncase, for handy use and protection. It is therefore adapted for almost any\r\nordinary purpose; and cannot be injuriously affected by any chemical\r\naction arising from air or sea-water. A set of these thermometers consists\r\nof six, carefully packed in a neat box; two having japanned metallic cases\r\n(fig. 52), the others being designed for use without the case, or to\r\nreplace a breakage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\nThis thermometer is employed in the Royal Navy, and for the observations\r\nmade at sea for the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer is now considered a necessary instrument on board ship.\r\nNot only is it of invaluable utility in connection with the barometer as a\r\nguide to the weather, but its indications are of service in showing the\r\npresence of a warm or cold current in the sea; many of the great oceanic\r\ncurrents being characterised by the warmth or coldness of their waters. In\r\nseas visited by icebergs, the habitual use of the thermometer would\r\nindicate their proximity, as the water is rendered colder for some\r\ndistance around by the thawing of huge masses of ice. The water over a\r\nshoal in the sea is generally colder than the surface-water of the\r\nsurrounding ocean; which may result from the cold water being brought to\r\nthe surface by the current of water encountering the shoal. With this fact\r\nnavigators are well acquainted; and therefore a fall in the sea-water\r\nthermometer may forebode that shallow water is at hand. It has been\r\nascertained that fish inhabit regions of the oceans and seas having the\r\npeculiar temperature suitable to their habits. The better and firmer sort\r\nof fish are found where cold waters exist. Those taken in warmer belts or\r\nstreams of water, even in the same latitude, are far inferior in\r\ncondition, and less approved by the palate. The fish of the Mediterranean,\r\na warm sea, are generally poor and scarce. Fish taken in the cold waters\r\nbetween the American shore and the Gulf Stream are much esteemed; while in\r\nand on the other side of the stream they are said to be tasteless, and of\r\nno flavour. Between the coasts of China and the warm waters of the\r\nJapanese current, the seas abound with excellent fish; but in the warm\r\nwaters of the current and beyond, they are never seen in such shoals.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is clearly ascertained that fishes are adapted to climates,\r\nlike birds and beasts. It has been even affirmed, after careful\r\ninvestigation, that herrings, which abound in the British Seas, and form a\r\nmost important branch of our fisheries, can only be found in a temperature\r\nvarying from 54 deg. to 58 deg. Hence the thermometer, if brought into use by the\r\nfishermen, would guide them to the spots where they may with the best\r\nchance cast their nets on dark nights, when other indications are not\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nThis thermometer in its metallic case is perfectly suited for dipping\r\noverboard, or placing in a bucket of water just taken from the sea, to\r\nascertain its temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSELF-REGISTERING THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=69. Importance of Self-Registering Thermometers.=--Heat being apparently\r\nthe most effective agent in producing meteorological phenomena, the\r\ndetermination of the highest temperature of the day, and the lowest during\r\nthe night, is a prime essential to enable an estimate of the climate of\r\nany place to be formed. To observe these extremes by means of the ordinary\r\nthermometer would be impracticable, from the constant watchfulness which\r\nwould be necessary. Hence, the utility and importance of self-recording\r\nthermometers are evident. A thermometer constructed to _register_ the\r\nhighest temperature is usually called a _maximum thermometer_; one to show\r\nthe lowest temperature is termed a _minimum thermometer_; and if made to\r\nrecord both extremes of temperature, it is designated a\r\n_maximum-and-minimum thermometer_. We will, for the sake of method,\r\ndescribe the instruments in use in this order.\r\n\r\nIt would carry us beyond our scope to explain in detail the methods of\r\ndealing with temperature observations; but we may remark that half the sum\r\nof the maximum and minimum temperature of each day of twenty-four hours,\r\nis not what meteorologists designate the _mean daily temperature_,\r\nalthough it very frequently approximates to it. The mean temperature of\r\nthe day is understood to be the average of twenty-four consecutive hourly\r\nreadings of a thermometer; and meteorology now supplies formulae whereby\r\nthis result can be deduced from two or three observations only in a day.\r\nBut we would observe that the actual mean temperature of any place has not\r\nsuch an important influence upon life, either animal or vegetable, as the\r\nabruptness and magnitude of the variations of temperature. Climate,\r\ntherefore, should be estimated more by the range of the thermometer than\r\nby the average of its indications. The Registrar General's returns prove\r\nthat with a wide range of the thermometer, the mortality greatly\r\nincreases; and it is now becoming apparent to meteorologists that the\r\ndaily range of the thermometer marks the effects of temperature on the\r\nhealth of men, and the success of crops, better than any other\r\nmeteorological fact of which we take cognizance. Now that self-registering\r\nthermometers are constructed with mercury, the most appropriate of all\r\nthermometric substances, not only for maxima, but likewise for minima\r\ntemperatures, the determination of the diurnal range of temperature is\r\nrendered more certain, and observations at different places are more\r\nstrictly comparable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMA THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\n=70. Rutherford's Maximum Thermometer.=--The maximum thermometer, invented\r\nby Dr. John Rutherford, differs from an ordinary thermometer in having a\r\nsmall cylinder of steel, porcelain, or aluminium, moving freely in the\r\ntube beyond the mercury, so as to form an index. The stem of the\r\nthermometer is fixed horizontally on the frame, which must be suspended in\r\nthe same position, as represented in fig. 53. The instrument is set by\r\nholding it bulb downward, so as to allow the index to fall by its own\r\ngravity into contact with the mercury. Increase of heat produces expansion\r\nof the mercury, which consequently pushes forward the index. When the\r\ntemperature decreases, the mercury recedes from the index, leaving it so\r\nthat the extremity which was in contact with the mercury indicates upon\r\nthe scale the highest temperature since the instrument was last set.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\nAs it is easily constructed and is comparatively cheap, it is still\r\nemployed for ordinary purposes. Its disadvantages are, firstly, its\r\nliability of soon getting out of order by the index becoming embedded in\r\nthe mercury, or fixed by oxidation, thus rendering it altogether useless;\r\nsecondly, the ease with which the index can be displaced by the wind\r\nmoving the instrument, or other accidental disturbance, so as to cause it\r\nto give erroneous indications occasionally; and thirdly, its consequent\r\ntotal unfitness for use at sea.\r\n\r\nIn the part of the tube beyond the mercury, a small quantity of air is\r\nenclosed for the purpose of preventing the metal flowing freely in the\r\ntube. This necessitates the construction of a larger bulb, which renders\r\nthe thermometer less sensitive. Moreover, as it frequently happens that\r\nsome mercury passes the index, particles of air insinuate themselves in\r\nthe metal, and cause separations in the column, which very often can be\r\nremoved only by a maker. To facilitate this re-adjustment, a small chamber\r\nis left at the end of the tube, and the mercury being expanded into it by\r\nheat until the index and air bubbles are forced into it, if possible, upon\r\nthe cooling down again, by a little management, the mercury will contract,\r\nleaving the air and index behind. Yet sometimes the index cannot be moved\r\nin the least from its place of fixture, so that the instrument must be\r\nvirtually reconstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=71. Phillip's Maximum Thermometer.=--A maximum thermometer, better\r\nperhaps in its action than Rutherford's, has been suggested by Professor\r\nJohn Phillips, of Oxford. A small portion of air is introduced into an\r\nordinary thermometer, so as to cut off about half an inch of the mercurial\r\nthread near its end in the tube. This forms a maximum thermometer, when\r\nthe stem is arranged horizontally. The isolated portion is pushed forward\r\nby expansion, and is left in this position when the mercury contracts.\r\nThe end remote from the bulb shows on the scale the maximum temperature.\r\n\r\nWhen made with a capillary tube so fine that the attraction arising from\r\ncapillarity overcomes the force of gravity, and prevents the mercury\r\nfalling to the end of the tube when the instrument is inverted, it forms a\r\nvery serviceable thermometer, quite portable and suitable for use on board\r\nship. In such a tube a smart shake from a swing of the hand is required to\r\nbring the detached portion back to the column, so as to set the instrument\r\nfor future observation; no ordinary motion will move it. When the\r\nthermometer has not this peculiarity, the mercury will flow to the end, if\r\nheld bulb downward; and in this state it is not at all a satisfactory\r\ninstrument, as the air is likely to be displaced, and a great deal of tact\r\nis requisite to again get it to divide the column suitably. It has been\r\nfound in practice that the air bubble at different temperatures assumes\r\ndifferent lengths, and if very small it disappears in a few years by\r\noxidation and by diffusion with the mercury, so that the instrument\r\nbecomes defective and uncertain in action,--results which led to the\r\nconstruction of the self-registering mercurial maximum thermometer,\r\ninvented and patented by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra. It has been before\r\nthe public about twelve years; we may therefore, now, safely speak of its\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=72. Negretti and Zambra's Patent Maximum Thermometer= consists of a glass\r\ntube containing mercury fitted on an engraved scale, as shown in fig. 54.\r\nThe part of the thermometer tube above the mercury is entirely free from\r\nair; and at the point A in the bend above the bulb, is inserted and fixed\r\nwith the blow-pipe a small piece of solid glass, or enamel, which acts as\r\na valve, allowing mercury to pass on one side of it when heat is applied,\r\nbut not allowing it to return when the thermometer cools. When mercury has\r\nbeen once made to pass the contraction, which nothing but the expansive\r\nforce of heat can effect, and has risen in the tube, the upper end of the\r\ncolumn registers the maximum temperature. To return the mercury to the\r\nbulb, we must apply a force equal to that which raised it in the tube; the\r\nforce employed is gravity, assisted when necessary by a little agitation\r\nof the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\nThe degrees are generally divided on the stems of these thermometers, but\r\ntheir frames of course bear a scale as well. The makers have various\r\nstyles of framing in wood, metal, porcelain, and even glass. Each material\r\nis eligible according to requirements. Porcelain scales, having the marks\r\n_etched_ upon them by acid and permanently blackened and baked in,--by a\r\nprocess for which the inventors have a separate patent,--will be found\r\nvery serviceable, as they do not corrode or tarnish by exposure to any\r\nkind of weather; while any amount of dust and dirt can readily be cleaned\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe chief recommendation of this thermometer is its simplicity of\r\nconstruction, enabling it to be used with confidence and safety. Of no\r\nother maximum thermometer can it be said that it is impossible to derange\r\nor put it out of order; hence, as regards durability, it surpasses all\r\nothers. Nothing short of actual breakage can cause it to fail. Hence it is\r\nthe most easily portable of all self-registering thermometers, an\r\nadvantage which renders it suitable for travellers, and for transmission\r\nabroad. In the year 1852, the British Meteorological Society reported this\r\nthermometer to be \"the best which has yet been constructed for maximum\r\ntemperature, and particularly for sun observations.\" Since then eleven\r\nyears have elapsed, and it is still without a rival.\r\n\r\n_Directions for use._ In using this thermometer for meteorological\r\nobservations, it should be suspended by means of two brass plates B, C,\r\nattached for that purpose, in such manner that it hangs raised up a little\r\nat C, and so placed that it is in the shade, with the air passing freely\r\nto it from all sides; then, on an increase of heat, the mercury will pass\r\nup the tube as in an ordinary thermometer, and continue doing so as long\r\nas the heat increases. On a decrease of heat, the contraction of mercury\r\nwill take place _below_ the _bend_ in the tube, leaving the whole column\r\nof mercury in the tube, thus registering the highest temperature, and\r\nshowing such till the instrument is disturbed.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the instrument for future observations, remove and hold it\r\nperpendicularly, with the bulb downward, and then shake it. The mercury\r\nwill then descend in the tube, and indicate the temperature of the air at\r\nthat time; and, when again suspended, is prepared for future observation.\r\n\r\nAfter the temperature has attained a maximum, there will be, with a\r\ndecrease of heat, a slight contraction of mercury in the tube--as well as\r\nof that in the bulb--and hence doubts have arisen as to the accuracy of\r\nthe registration; but calculation shows, and critical trial has proved,\r\nthat the greatest daily range of temperature will not produce an error\r\nlarge enough to be appreciable on the scale.\r\n\r\nA very great advantage of this thermometer is that the mercury may be\r\nallowed to flow to the end of the tube without the maximum temperature\r\nattained during an experiment being lost. It can be employed with the bulb\r\nuppermost. All that is necessary for reading the maximum temperature is to\r\nslope the instrument so that the mercury flows gently towards the bulb. It\r\nwill then stop at the contraction so as to show the maximum temperature on\r\nthe scale. Afterwards the mercury is driven into the bulb by agitating the\r\ninstrument while held in the hand. Hence the instrument is invaluable as a\r\nregistering thermometer on board ship, as its indications are in no way\r\naffected by the motions and tremors of the vessel.\r\n\r\nFor physiological experiments, such as taking the temperature of the\r\nmouth in fever, this thermometer is the only one that can be used with\r\ncertainty, as it can be held in any position, without losing the maximum\r\ntemperature attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINIMA THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\n=73. Rutherford's Alcohol Minimum Thermometer=, fig. 55, consists of a\r\nglass tube, the bulb and part of the bore of which is filled with\r\nperfectly pure spirits of wine, in which moves freely a black glass index.\r\nA slight elevation of the thermometer, bulb uppermost, will cause the\r\nglass index to flow to the surface of the liquid, where it will remain,\r\nunless violently shaken. On a _decrease_ of temperature the alcohol\r\nrecedes, taking with it the glass index; on an _increase_ of temperature\r\nthe alcohol alone ascends in the tube, leaving the end of the index\r\n_farthest_ from the bulb indicating the minimum temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.]\r\n\r\n_Directions for using, &c._--Having caused the glass index to flow to the\r\nend of the column of spirit, by slightly tilting the thermometer, bulb\r\nuppermost, suspend the instrument (in the shade with the air passing\r\nfreely to it on all sides) by the two brass plates attached for that\r\npurpose,--in such manner that the bulb is about half an inch lower than\r\nthe upper, or the end of the thermometer farthest from the bulb; then, on\r\na decrease of temperature, the spirits of wine will descend, carrying with\r\nit the glass index; on an increase of temperature, however, the spirits of\r\nwine will ascend in the tube, leaving that end of the small glass index\r\nfarthest from the bulb indicating the minimum temperature. To reset the\r\ninstrument, simply raise the bulb end of the thermometer a little, as\r\nbefore observed, and the index will again descend to the end of the\r\ncolumn, ready for future observation.\r\n\r\n_Precautions._--1. By no means jerk or shake an alcohol minimum\r\nthermometer _when resetting_ it, for by so doing it is liable to\r\ndisarrange the instrument, either by causing the index to leave the\r\nspirit, or by separating a portion of the spirit from the main column.\r\n\r\n2. As alcohol thermometers have a tendency to read lower by age, owing to\r\nthe volatile nature of the fluid allowing particles in the form of vapour\r\nto rise and lodge in the tube, it becomes necessary to compare them\r\noccasionally with a mercurial thermometer whose index error is known; and\r\nif the difference be more than a few tenths of a degree, examine well the\r\nupper part of the tube to see if any alcohol is hanging in the bore\r\nthereof; if so, the detached portion of it can be joined to the main\r\ncolumn by swinging the thermometer with a pendulous motion, _bulb\r\ndownwards_.\r\n\r\n3. The spirit column is sometimes much separated by jolting in travelling.\r\nIf the instrument is in such a condition when received, it should be held\r\nby the right hand, bulb downward, and the frame tapped smartly, but\r\ncautiously, against the palm of the left hand. The broken thread of spirit\r\nwill soon begin to join, and by continuing the operation a sufficient time\r\nall the bubbles will disappear, and the thermometer become as good as\r\never.\r\n\r\n\r\n=74. Horticultural Minimum Thermometer.=--This instrument, represented in\r\nfig. 56, is a special construction of Rutherford's minimum thermometer to\r\nmeet the requirements of horticulturists. It is desirable, if not\r\nessential, that gardeners should have the means of ascertaining to what\r\ntemperature stoves and greenhouses descend on cold nights, especially in\r\nwinter. This thermometer is mounted on a strong cast zinc frame, with the\r\ndivisions and figures of the scale raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.]\r\n\r\nThe sunk surface of the frame is painted dark; the figures and division a\r\nbright colour, so that observations can be made without a close inspection\r\nof the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe directions for using are the same as those given in the preceding\r\nsection. It may be used as an ordinary thermometer, by simply hanging it\r\nfrom the top loop, in which position, the coloured liquid will always\r\nindicate the present temperature.\r\n\r\nIt was a source of annoyance with the ordinary boxwood and flat metal\r\nscales, that after a time, exposure to a damp warm atmosphere favoured the\r\ngrowth of confervae upon them, and obliterated the divisions; the plan of\r\nraising the figures and divisions of the scale has been found to prevent\r\nthe destruction of the instrument in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n=75. Baudin's Alcohol Minimum Thermometer.=--This instrument resembles\r\nRutherford's thermometer in appearance; its indications are given by the\r\nexpansion and contraction of alcohol, and its minimum temperature is\r\nlikewise registered by a glass index being pulled back and left behind by\r\nthe alcohol, as in Rutherford's instrument. There is, however, a great\r\nimprovement in Baudin's instrument; for whilst Rutherford's thermometer\r\ncan only register in a horizontal position, Baudin's can be used either\r\nhorizontally or vertically, as necessity may require. This important\r\nchange is effected in the following manner:--Instead of the index in the\r\nthermometer being loose and free to run up and down according to the\r\nposition in which the instrument is held, as in Rutherford's, the index in\r\nthe new instrument is made to fit the bore of the tube as nearly tight as\r\npossible, so much so that in holding the thermometer even upside down, or\r\nshaking it, the index will not shift from its position; but, inasmuch as a\r\nminimum thermometer with an immoveable index could not be set when\r\nrequired for observation, and would consequently be useless, the inventor\r\nhas introduced behind the index a piece of solid glass, about\r\none-and-a-half inch in length, which moves freely in the alcohol. The\r\naddition of the weight of this piece of glass on the top of the index,\r\nwhen turned upside down, forces the index down to the edge of the alcohol;\r\nand it is there left, as in the case of the ordinary Rutherford's\r\nthermometer. It is, therefore, by turning the thermometer upside down, and\r\nletting the moveable piece of glass fall on the index, that the index is\r\ndriven to the end of the alcohol; after this operation the thermometer is\r\nhung up either horizontally or vertically, and will then be ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe index, although immoveable _per se_, is by the alcohol drawn back, as\r\nin the ordinary minimum, and its indications are read off on the scale\r\nfrom the top of the index.\r\n\r\n\r\n=76. Mercurial Minima Thermometers desirable.=--Alcohol does not expand\r\nequally for equal increments of heat, consequently errors are likely to\r\nexist in the scale indications unless the graduations are very\r\naccurately--not necessarily equally--made. On this account, as well as\r\nfrom the volatility of alcohol, and the intervention of gaseous partitions\r\nin the tube, a good and thoroughly reliable minimum thermometer was for a\r\nlong time a desideratum. It was desirable to obtain a thermometer which\r\nshould register the lowest temperature by mercury, the fluid in general\r\nuse for meteorological thermometers. Several instruments have recently\r\nbeen invented to meet this requirement, which are suitable and\r\nsatisfactory for land purposes, but one well adapted for use on board ship\r\nis still very much wanted.\r\n\r\nFor very low temperatures, alcohol thermometers will always be required;\r\nas mercury freezes at -40 deg. F, and contracts very irregularly much before\r\nthis point, while alcohol has never yet been frozen.\r\n\r\n\r\n=77. Negretti and Zambra's Patent Mercurial Minimum Thermometer=,\r\nrepresented by fig. 57, has a cylindrical bulb of large size, which, at\r\nfirst sight, might induce the idea that the instrument would not be\r\nsufficiently sensitive; but as length is given to the cylinder instead of\r\nincreasing its diameter, it will be found as sensitive as a globular bulb\r\nof the same diameter, and much more so than an ordinary alcohol\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nThe reason for having the bulb large is to allow the internal diameter of\r\nthe thermometer tube to be larger than that generally used for\r\nthermometrical purposes, so that a steel index, pointed at both ends, may\r\nmove freely within when required.\r\n\r\nThe tube is blown, filled and regulated in the usual way, 60 deg. of\r\ntemperature being about half-way up the tube. A small cylindrical bulb is\r\nthen formed at the upper end of the tube, and then is introduced a steel\r\nneedle pointed at both ends, that in contact with the mercury being\r\nabrupt, the other more prolonged. The open extremity of the tube is now\r\ndrawn out into a fine capillary tube, and the bulb of the instrument\r\nwarmed so as to cause the mercury to fill the tube completely. When the\r\nmercury reaches the capillary tube, the flame of a blow-pipe is applied;\r\nthe glass is dexterously melted, the superfluous part taken away, and the\r\ntube left hermetically closed. During this operation, the steel index has\r\nbeen embedded in the heated mercury. As the instrument cools, if held\r\nupright, the mercury will recede and expose the needle, which will then\r\nfollow the descending column simply by its own gravity. In this condition\r\nthe thermometer resembles Rutherford's maximum, being a tube of mercury\r\nwith a steel index floating on its surface; but it possesses these\r\nimportant advantages: it is quite free from air, so that the mercury can\r\nmove with perfect freedom; and the index is pointed at both ends, to allow\r\nthe mercury to pass, instead of being ground flat to prevent it.\r\n\r\n_To use the Thermometer_, it is suspended perpendicularly (figure 57) with\r\nthe steel index resting on the surface of the mercurial column. As the\r\nmercury in the cylinder contracts, that in the tube descends, and the\r\nindex, of its own gravity, follows it; on the contrary, as the mercury\r\nexpands and rises in the tube, it passes the index on one side, and in\r\nrising, exerts a lateral pressure on the needle, and jams it to one side\r\nof the tube, where it remains firmly fixed, leaving the upper point of the\r\nneedle indicating the minimum temperature. In this thermometer, the\r\nreading is always from the upper point of the needle, and not from the\r\nmercury itself.\r\n\r\n_To extricate the Needle_ from the mercury, a magnet is used, when, if the\r\nneedle is embedded only a few degrees, it can readily be withdrawn without\r\naltering the position of the instrument. Should the magnet not be\r\nsufficient for the purpose, we simply turn the thermometer on its support\r\nfrom the upright position, slightly elevating the bulb (fig. 58 (=2=)).\r\nThe mercury and index will then flow into the small reservoir. Should the\r\nindex not freely leave the tube with the mercury, assist it with a magnet,\r\nand when the mercury and index are in the upper bulb (figure =2=), apply a\r\nmagnet outside, which will attract and hold fast the index; and whilst\r\nthus holding it, again bring the thermometer to the upright position, when\r\nthe mercury will immediately fall back into the tube, leaving the index\r\nattached to the magnet (figure =4=), with which it is guided down to the\r\nsurface of the mercury, ready for another observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\nCare must be taken not to withdraw the magnet until the index is in\r\ncontact with mercury; for, if released before touching, it might plunge\r\ntoo deeply, and give a false indication. The rule for re-setting it will\r\nbe to bring the needle-point in contact with the mercury, and then\r\nwithdraw the magnet, having previously ascertained that no particles of\r\nmercury are attached to the index.\r\n\r\nIt may sometimes, though rarely, happen, that from the time a minimum\r\ntemperature is registered by the index, and by the time an observation is\r\nmade, the mercury may have risen so high in the tube as to completely pass\r\nthe index, as shown (figure =3=). Should it so happen, the space which the\r\nindex occupies will readily be observed, as it will be pressed to one side\r\nof the tube, causing a different appearance in that part, although the\r\npoint of the needle may not be seen. If such be the case, apply a magnet\r\nto the spot where you see the index is fixed: this will hold the needle\r\nfirmly. Then, by slightly tilting the thermometer bulb uppermost, the\r\nmercury will flow into the top bulb, leaving the index attached to the\r\nmagnet, and quite uncovered. Having taken the reading, draw the needle\r\ninto the top bulb, and hold it there whilst you adjust the thermometer by\r\nagain bringing it to the upright position.\r\n\r\nBy contracting the bore of this thermometer, at the bend of the tube,\r\nsufficiently to keep the mercury from flowing out of its bulb with too\r\nmuch freedom by motion, the instrument becomes perfectly safe for\r\ntransmission abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n=78. Negretti & Zambra's Second Patent Mercurial Minimum Thermometer.=--In\r\nthis thermometer a principle is used that has been long known to\r\nscientific men, viz. the affinity of mercury for platinum. If mercury be\r\nplaced in contact with platinum under ordinary circumstances, no effect\r\nwill take place; but if the mercury is once made to attack the platinum,\r\nthe amalgamation is permanent and the contact perfect, so much so, that\r\nthe principle was made use of in constructing standard barometers. A ring\r\nof platinum was fused round the end of the tube, dipping into the mercury;\r\nand the contact between the platinum and mercury became so perfect that\r\nair could not creep down the tube and up the bore, as in ordinary\r\nbarometer tubes. This principle of adhesion or affinity of mercury for\r\nplatinum has been brought into play for the purpose of arresting the\r\nmercury after it has reached the minimum temperature in a thermometer.\r\nThis thermometer is made as follows:--behind the bulb is placed a\r\nsupplementary chamber; in the space or neck between the bulb of the\r\nthermometer and the chamber, is placed a small piece of platinum; this may\r\nbe of any shape or size, but the smaller the better. This is not to fit in\r\nthe neck; it must, on the contrary, be rather loose; it may be fastened in\r\nposition or not. The instrument is represented by fig. 59.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\n_Directions for using._--Having suspended the thermometer in a horizontal\r\nposition, the mercury is made to stand in exact contact with the platinum\r\nplug by slightly elevating the bulb end of the instrument. The thermometer\r\nis now ready for observation. On a decrease of temperature, the mercury\r\nwill endeavour to contract first from the easier passage, viz. behind the\r\nbulb; but in consequence of the adhesion of the mercury to the platinum,\r\nit cannot recede from here, it is therefore forced to contract from the\r\nindicating tube, and will continue to do so as long as the temperature\r\ndecreases; and as no indices are employed in this thermometer, the extreme\r\nend of the mercurial column will show \"how cold it has been.\" On an\r\nincrease of temperature the mercury will glide over the platinum plug and\r\nexpand by the easier passage into the supplementary chamber, and there\r\nremain until a decrease of temperature again takes place, when the mercury\r\nthat had gone into the supplementary chamber will be the first to recede,\r\nuntil it reaches the platinum plug, its further progress being arrested;\r\nit will then fall in the indicating tube, and there remain until re-set.\r\n\r\n\r\n=79. Casella's Mercurial Minimum Thermometer.=--The general form and\r\narrangement of this instrument is shown in fig. 60. A tube with large\r\nbore, _a_, has at the end a _flat glass diaphragm_ formed by the abrupt\r\njunction of a small chamber, _b c_, the inlet to which at _b_ is larger\r\nthan the bore of the indicating tube. The result of this is that on\r\nsetting the thermometer, as described below, the contracting force of the\r\nmercury in cooling withdraws the fluid in the indicating stem only; whilst\r\non its expanding with heat, the long column does not move, the increased\r\nbulk of mercury finding an easier passage into the small pear-shaped\r\nchamber attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.]\r\n\r\nWe believe that a small speck of air must be confined in the chamber, _b\r\nc_, to act as a spring to start the mercury from the chamber in the act of\r\nsetting the thermometer. Were this air not present, the mercury would so\r\nadhere to the glass that no amount of shaking could induce it to flow from\r\nthe chamber.\r\n\r\n_To set the Instrument_, place it in a horizontal position, with the back\r\nplate, _d_, suspended on a nail, and the lower part supported on a hook,\r\n_e_. The bulb end may now be gently raised or lowered, causing the mercury\r\nto flow slowly until the bent part, _a_, _is full_ and the chamber, _b c_,\r\n_quite empty_. At this point the flow of mercury in the long stem of the\r\ntube is arrested, _and indicates the exact temperature_ of the bulb or air\r\nat the time. On an increase of temperature the mercury will expand into\r\nthe small chamber, _b c_; and a return of cold will cause its recession\r\nfrom this chamber only, until it reaches the diaphragm, _b_. Any further\r\ndiminution of heat withdraws the mercury down the bore to whatever degree\r\nthe cold may attain, where it remains until farther withdrawn by increased\r\ncold, or till re-set for future observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMA AND MINIMA THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\n=80. Rutherford's= arrangement for obtaining a complete instrument for the\r\nregistration of heat and cold was simply mounting a maximum thermometer\r\nand a minimum thermometer upon the same frame or slab. Thus constructed,\r\nthey are often called \"day and night\" thermometers, though somewhat\r\ninappropriately; for in temperate climates the temperature of the night\r\nsometimes exceeds that of the day, notwithstanding the reverse is the\r\ngeneral law of temperature. Fig. 61 will explain the arrangement of\r\nRutherford's day and night thermometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=81. Sixe's Self-Registering Thermometer.=--The very ingenious and\r\ncertainly elegant instrument about to be described was invented by James\r\nSixe, of Colchester. It consists of a long cylindrical bulb, united to a\r\ntube of more than twice its length, bent round each side of it in the form\r\nof a syphon, and terminated in a smaller, oval-shaped bulb. Figure 62\r\ngives a representation of this instrument. The lower portion of the syphon\r\nis filled with mercury; the long bulb, the other parts of the tube, and\r\npart of the small bulb, with highly rectified alcohol. A steel index moves\r\nin the spirit in each limb of the syphon. The two indices are terminated\r\nat top and bottom with a bead of glass, to enable them to move with the\r\nleast possible friction, and without causing separation of the spirit, or\r\nallowing mercury to pass easily. They would, from their weight, always\r\nrest upon the mercury; but each has a fine hair tied to its upper\r\nextremity and bent against the interior of the tube, which acts as a\r\nspring with sufficient elasticity to keep the index supported in the\r\nspirit in opposition to gravity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument acts as follows:--A rise of temperature causes the spirit\r\nin the long bulb to expand and press some of the mercury into the other\r\nlimb of the syphon, into which it rises also from its own expansion, and\r\ncarries the index with it, until the greatest temperature is attained. The\r\nlower end of this index then indicates upon the engraved scale the maximum\r\ntemperature. As the temperature falls the spirit and the mercury contract,\r\nand in returning towards the bulb the second index is met and carried up\r\nby the mercury until the lowest temperature occurs, when it is left to\r\nindicate upon the scale the minimum temperature. The limb of the syphon\r\nadjoining the bulb requires, therefore, a descending scale of\r\nthermometric degrees; the other limb, an ascending scale. The graduations\r\nmust be obtained by comparisons with a standard thermometer under\r\nartificial temperatures, which should be done in this way for every 5 deg., in\r\norder to correct for the inequality in the bore of the tube, and the\r\nirregular expansion of the spirit. The instrument is set for observation\r\nby bringing the indices into contact with the mercury, by means of a small\r\nmagnet, which attracts the steel through the glass, so that it is readily\r\ndrawn up or down. They should be drawn nearly to the top of the limbs when\r\nit is desired to remove the instrument, which should be carefully carried\r\nin the vertical position; for should it be inverted, or laid flat, the\r\nspirit may get among the mercury, and so break up the column as to require\r\nthe skill of a maker to put it in order again. For transmission by\r\nordinary conveyances, it requires that attention be given to keep it\r\nvertical. The entanglement of a small portion of mercury with the indices\r\nis sometimes a source of annoyance in this instrument, for the readings\r\nare thereby rendered somewhat incorrect. Small breakages in the mercury,\r\neither from intervening bubbles of spirit or adhesion to the indices, may\r\ngenerally be rectified by cautiously tapping the frame of the instrument,\r\nso as to cause the mercury to unite by the assistance thus given to its\r\nsuperior gravity.\r\n\r\nThese thermometers, when carefully made and adjusted to a standard\r\nthermometer, are strongly recommended for ordinary purposes, where strict\r\nscientific accuracy is not required. This is also the only fluid\r\nthermometer applicable for determining the temperature of the sea at\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nRADIATION THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=82. Solar and Terrestrial Radiation considered.=--The surface of the\r\nearth absorbs the heat of the sun during the day, and radiates heat into\r\nspace during the night. The envelope of gases and vapour, which we call\r\nthe atmosphere, exerts highly important functions upon these processes.\r\nThanks to the researches of Professor Tyndall, we are now enabled to\r\nunderstand these functions much more clearly than heretofore. His\r\nelaborate, patient, and remarkably sagacious series of experiments upon\r\nradiant heat, have satisfactorily demonstrated that _dry_ air is as\r\ntransparent to radiant heat as the vacuum itself; while air _perfectly\r\nsaturated_ with aqueous vapour absorbs more than five per cent. of radiant\r\nheat, estimated by the thermal unit adopted for the galvanometer\r\nindications of the effect upon a thermo-electric pile.\r\n\r\nAqueous vapour, in the form of fog or mist, as is well known, gives to our\r\nsensation a feeling of cold, and interferes with the healthy action of the\r\nskin and the lungs; the cause being its property of absorbing heat from\r\nour person.\r\n\r\nAir containing moisture in an invisible state likewise exerts a remarkable\r\ninfluence in radiating and absorbing heat. By reason of these properties,\r\naqueous vapour acts as a kind of blanket upon the ground, and maintains\r\nupon it a higher temperature than it would otherwise have. \"Regarding the\r\nearth as a source of heat, no doubt at least ten per cent. of its heat is\r\nintercepted within ten feet of the surface.\" Thus vapour--whether\r\ntransparent and invisible, or visible, as cloud, fog, or mist--is\r\nintimately connected with the important operations of solar and\r\nterrestrial radiation. Cloudy, or humid days, diminish the effect upon the\r\nsoil of solar radiation; similar nights retard the radiation from the\r\nearth. A dry atmosphere is the most favourable for the direct transmission\r\nof the sun's rays; and the withdrawal of the sun from any region over\r\nwhich the air is dry, must be followed by very rapid cooling of the soil.\r\n\"The removal, for a single summer night, of the aqueous vapour from the\r\natmosphere which covers England, would be attended by the destruction of\r\nevery plant which a freezing temperature could kill. In Sahara, where 'the\r\nsoil is fire and the wind is flame,' the refrigeration at night is often\r\npainful to bear. Ice has been formed in this region at night. In\r\nAustralia, also, the _diurnal range_ of temperature is very great,\r\namounting, commonly, to between 40 and 50 degrees. In short, it may be\r\nsafely predicted, that wherever the air is _dry_, the daily thermometric\r\nrange will be great. This, however, is quite different from saying that\r\nwhen the air is _clear_, the thermometric range will be great. Great\r\nclearness to light is perfectly compatible with great opacity to heat; the\r\natmosphere may be charged with aqueous vapour while a deep blue sky is\r\noverhead; and on such occasions the terrestrial radiation would,\r\nnotwithstanding the 'clearness,' be intercepted.\" The great range of the\r\nthermometer is attributable to the absence of that protection against gain\r\nor loss of heat which is afforded when aqueous vapour is present in the\r\nair; and during such weather the rapid abstraction of moisture from the\r\nsurface of plants and animals is very deleterious to their healthy\r\ncondition. \"The nipping of tender plants by frost, even when the air of\r\nthe garden is some degrees above the freezing temperature, is also to be\r\nreferred to chilling by radiation.\" Hence the practice of gardeners of\r\nspreading thin mats, of bad radiating material, over tender plants, is\r\noften attended with great benefit.\r\n\r\nBy means of the process of terrestrial radiation ice is artificially\r\nformed in Bengal, \"where the substance is never formed naturally. Shallow\r\npits are dug, which are partially filled with straw, and on the straw flat\r\npans containing water which had been boiled is exposed to the clear\r\nfirmament. The water is a very powerful radiant, and sends off its heat\r\ninto space. The heat thus lost cannot be supplied from the earth--this\r\nsource being cut off by the non-conducting straw. Before sunrise a cake of\r\nice is formed in each vessel.... To produce the ice in abundance, the\r\natmosphere must not only be clear, but it must be comparatively free from\r\naqueous vapour.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering, therefore, the important consequences attending both\r\nterrestrial and solar radiation, it appears to us that observations from\r\nradiation thermometers are of much more utility in judging of climate than\r\nis usually supposed. These observations are very scanty; and what few are\r\nupon record are not very reliable, principally from bad exposure of the\r\ninstruments, while the want of uniformity in construction may be another\r\ncause. Herschell's actinometer and Pouillet's pyrheliometer, instruments\r\nfor ascertaining the absolute heating effect of the sun's rays, should,\r\nhowever, be more generally employed by meteorologists. In comparing\r\nobservations on radiation it should be kept in mind, that \"the difference\r\nbetween a thermometer which, properly confined [or shaded], gives the true\r\ntemperature of the night air, and one which is permitted to radiate freely\r\ntowards space, must be greater at high elevations than at low ones;\"[6]\r\nbecause the higher the place, the less the thickness of the vapour-screen\r\nto intercept the radiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=83. Solar Radiation Thermometer.=--\"As the interchange of heat between\r\ntwo bodies by radiation depends upon the relative temperature which they\r\nrespectively possess, the earth, by the rays transmitted from the sun\r\nduring the day, must be continually gaining an accession of heat, which\r\nwould be far from being counterbalanced by the opposite effect of its own\r\nradiation into space. Hence, from sunrise till two or three hours after\r\nmid-day, the earth goes on gradually increasing in temperature, the\r\naugmentation being greatest where the surface consists of materials\r\ncalculated, from their colour and texture, to absorb heat, and where it is\r\ndeficient in moisture, which, by its evaporation, would have a tendency\r\nto diminish it.\"[7] It is, therefore, important to have instruments for\r\nmeasuring the efficacy of solar radiation, apart from those for exhibiting\r\nthe temperature of the place in the shade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.]\r\n\r\nFig. 63 shows the arrangement of Negretti & Zambra's maximum thermometer,\r\nfor registering the greatest heat of the sun's direct rays, hence called a\r\n_solar radiation thermometer_. It has a blackened bulb, the scale divided\r\non its own stem, and the divisions protected by a glass shield. In use it\r\nshould be placed nearly horizontally, resting on Y supports of wood or\r\nmetal, with its bulb in the full rays of the sun, resting on grass, and,\r\nif possible, so that lateral winds should not strike the bulb; and at a\r\nsufficient distance from any wall, so that it does not receive any\r\n_reflected_ heat from the sun. Some observers place the thermometer as\r\nmuch as two feet from the ground. It would be very desirable if one\r\nuniform plan could be recognized: that of placing the instrument as\r\nindicated in the figure appears to be most generally adopted, and the\r\nleast objectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=84. Vacuum Solar Radiation Thermometer.=--In order that the heat absorbed\r\nby the blackened bulb of the solar radiation thermometer may not in part\r\nbe carried off by the currents of air which would come into contact with\r\nit, the instrument has been improved by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra into\r\nthe _vacuum solar radiation thermometer_, as illustrated by fig. 64.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.]\r\n\r\nThis consists of a blackened-bulb radiation thermometer, enclosed in a\r\nglass tube and globe, from which all air is exhausted. Thus protected from\r\nthe loss of heat which would ensue if the bulb were exposed, its\r\nindications are from 20 deg. to 30 deg. higher than when placed side by side with\r\na similar instrument with the bulb exposed to the passing air. At times\r\nwhen the air has been in rapid motion, the difference between the reading\r\nof a thermometer giving the true temperature of the air in the shade, and\r\nan ordinary solar radiation thermometer, has been 20 deg. only, whilst the\r\ndifference between the air temperature and the reading of a radiation\r\nthermometer in vacuo has been as large as 50 deg. It is also found that the\r\nreadings are almost identical at distances from the earth varying from six\r\ninches to eighteen inches. By the use of this improvement, it is hoped\r\nthat the amounts of solar radiation at different places may be rendered\r\ncomparable; hitherto they have not been so; the results found at different\r\nplaces cannot be compared, as the bulbs of the thermometers are under very\r\ndifferent circumstances as to exposure and currents of air. Important\r\nresults are anticipated from this arrangement. The observations at\r\ndifferent places are expected to present more agreement. Observers would\r\ndo well to note carefully the effect of any remarkable degree of intensity\r\nin the solar heat upon particular plants, crops, fruit or other trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n=85. Terrestrial Radiation Thermometer= is an alcohol minimum thermometer,\r\nwith the graduations etched upon the stem, and protected by a glass\r\nshield, as shown in figure 65, instead of being mounted on a frame. The\r\nbulb is transparent; that is to say, the spirit is not coloured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.]\r\n\r\nIn use, it should be placed with its bulb fully exposed to the sky,\r\nresting on grass, the stem being supported by little forks of wood. The\r\nprecautions required with this thermometer are similar to those for\r\nordinary spirit thermometers, explained at page 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.]\r\n\r\n=86. AEthrioscope.=--The celebrated experimental philosopher, Sir John\r\nLeslie, was the inventor of this instrument, the purpose of which is to\r\ngive a comparative idea of the radiation proceeding from the surface of\r\nthe earth towards the sky. It consists, as represented in fig. 66, of two\r\nglass bulbs united by a vertical glass tube, of so fine a bore that a\r\nlittle coloured liquid is supported in it by its own adhesion, there being\r\nair confined in each of the bulbs. The bulb, _A_, is enclosed in a highly\r\npolished brass sphere, _D_, made in halves and screwed together. The bulb,\r\n_B_, is blackened and placed in the centre of a metallic cup, _C_, which\r\nis well gilt on the inside, and which may be covered by a top, _F_. The\r\nbrass coverings defend both bulbs from solar radiation, or any\r\nadventitious source of heat. When the top is on, the liquid remains at\r\nzero of the scale. On removing the top and presenting the instrument to a\r\nclear sky, either by night or by day, the bulb, _B_, is cooled by\r\nterrestrial radiation, while the bulb, _A_, retains the temperature of the\r\nair. The air confined in _B_, therefore, contracts; and the elasticity of\r\nthat within _A_ forces the liquid up the tube, to a height proportionate\r\nto the intensity of the radiation. Such is the sensitiveness of the\r\ninstrument, that the smallest cloud passing over it checks the rise of the\r\nliquid. Sir John Leslie says:--\"Under a clear blue sky, the _aethrioscope_\r\nwill sometimes indicate a cold of fifty millesimal degrees; yet, on other\r\ndays, _when the air seems equally bright_, the effect is hardly 30 deg.\" This\r\nanomaly, according to Dr. Tyndall, is simply due to the difference in the\r\nquantity of aqueous vapour present in the atmosphere. The presence of\r\ninvisible vapour intercepts the radiation from the aethrioscope, while its\r\nabsence opens a door for the escape of this radiation into space.\r\n\r\n\r\n=87. Pouillet's Pyrheliometer.=--\"This instrument is composed of a shallow\r\ncylinder of steel, _A_, fig. 67, which is filled with mercury. Into the\r\ncylinder a thermometer, _D_, is introduced, the stem of which is protected\r\nby a piece of brass tubing. We thus obtain the temperature of the mercury.\r\nThe flat end of the cylinder is to be turned towards the sun, and the\r\nsurface, _B_, thus presented is coated with lamp black. There is a collar\r\nand screw, _C_, by means of which the instrument may be attached to a\r\nstake driven into the ground, or into the snow, if the observations are\r\nmade at considerable heights. It is necessary that the surface which\r\nreceives the sun's rays should be perpendicular to the rays; and this is\r\nsecured by appending to the brass tube which shields the stem of the\r\nthermometer, a disk, _E_, of precisely the same diameter as the steel\r\ncylinder. When the shadow of the cylinder accurately covers the disk, we\r\nare sure that the rays fall, as perpendiculars, on the upturned surface of\r\nthe cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.]\r\n\r\n\"The observations are made in the following manner:--First, the instrument\r\nis permitted, not to receive the sun's rays, but to radiate its own heat\r\nfor five minutes against an unclouded part of the firmament; the decrease\r\nof the temperature of the mercury consequent on this radiation is then\r\nnoted. Next, the instrument is turned towards the sun, so that the solar\r\nrays fall perpendicularly upon it for five minutes; the augmentation of\r\nheat is now noted. Finally, the instrument is turned again towards the\r\nfirmament, away from the sun, and allowed to radiate for another five\r\nminutes, the sinking of the thermometer being noted as before. In order to\r\nobtain the whole heating power of the sun, we must add to his observed\r\nheating power the quantity lost during the time of exposure, and this\r\nquantity is the mean of the first and last observations. Supposing the\r\nletter _R_ to represent the augmentation of temperature by five minutes'\r\nexposure to the sun, and that _t_ and _t^1_ represent the reductions of\r\ntemperature observed before and after, then the whole force of the sun,\r\nwhich we may call _T_, would be thus expressed:--_T = R + 1/2(t + t^1)_.\r\n\r\n\"The surface on which the sun's rays here fall is known; the quantity of\r\nmercury within the cylinder is also known; hence we can express the effect\r\nof the sun's heat upon a given area, by stating that it is competent, in\r\nfive minutes, to raise so much mercury so many degrees in\r\ntemperature.\"--_Dr. Tyndall's \"Heat considered as a Mode of Motion.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.]\r\n\r\n=88. Sir John Herschell's Actinometer=, for ascertaining the absolute\r\nheating effect of the solar rays, in which _time_ is considered one of the\r\nelements of observation, is illustrated by fig. 68. The actinometer\r\nconsists of a large cylindrical thermometer bulb, with a scale\r\nconsiderably lengthened, so that minute changes may be easily seen. The\r\nbulb is of transparent glass filled with a deep blue liquid, which is\r\nexpanded when the rays of the sun fall direct on the bulb. To take an\r\nobservation, the actinometer is placed in the shade for one minute and\r\nread off; it is then exposed for one minute to sunshine, and its\r\nindication recorded; it is finally restored to the shade, and its reading\r\nnoted. The mean of the two readings in the shade, subtracted from that in\r\nthe sun, gives the actual amount of expansion of the liquid produced by\r\nthe sun's rays in one minute of time.

Walker; or the _Admiralty Manual of\r\nScientific Instructions_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDEEP-SEA THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=89. On Sixe's Principle.=--Thermometers for ascertaining the temperature\r\nof the sea at various depths are constructed to register either the\r\nmaximum or minimum temperature, or both. The principle of each instrument\r\nis that of Sixe. There are very few parts of the ocean in which the\r\ntemperature below is greater than at the surface, except in the Polar\r\nSeas, where it is generally found to be a few degrees warmer at\r\nconsiderable depths than at the surface. When the instrument is required\r\nto register only one temperature, it can be made narrower and more\r\ncompact--a great advantage in sounding; and with less length of bulb and\r\nglass tube, so that the liability of error is diminished. Hence, the\r\nminimum is the most generally useful for deep-sea soundings. These\r\nthermometers must be sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure of the\r\nocean at two or three miles of depth, where there may be a force exerted\r\nto compress them exceeding three or four hundred atmospheres (of 15 lbs.\r\nto the square inch).\r\n\r\nMany have been the contrivances for obtaining correct deep-sea\r\nindications. Thermometers and machines of various sorts have been\r\nsuggested, adopted, and eventually abandoned as only approximate\r\ninstruments. The principal reason for such instruments failing to give\r\ncorrect or reliable indications, has been that the weight or pressure on\r\nthe bulbs at great depths has interfered with the correct reading of the\r\ninstruments. Thermometers have been enclosed in strong water-tight cases\r\nto resist the pressure; but this contrivance has only had the tendency to\r\nretard the action, so much so as to throw a doubt on the indications\r\nobtained by the instrument so constructed.\r\n\r\nThe thermometers constructed by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra for this\r\npurpose do not differ materially from those usually made under the\r\ndenomination of Sixe's thermometers, except in the following most\r\nimportant particular:--The usual Sixe's thermometers have a central\r\nreservoir or cylinder containing alcohol; this reservoir, which is the\r\nonly portion of the instrument likely to be affected by pressure, has\r\nbeen, in Negretti and Zambra's new instrument, superseded by a strong\r\nouter cylinder of glass, containing mercury and rarefied air; by this\r\nmeans the portion of the instrument susceptible of compression, has been\r\nso strengthened that no amount of pressure can possibly make the\r\ninstrument vary. This instrument has been tested in every possible manner,\r\nand the results have been highly satisfactory, so much so as to place\r\ntheir reliability beyond any possible doubt.\r\n\r\nThe scales are made of porcelain, and are firmly secured to a back of oak,\r\nwhich holds in a recess the bulb with its protecting shield, and is\r\nrounded off so as to fit easily and firmly in a stout cylindrical copper\r\ncase, in which the thermometer is sent down when sounding (see fig. 69).\r\nThe lid of the case is made to fit down closely, and water-tight. At the\r\nbottom of the case is a valve opening upward; and the lid has a similar\r\nvalve. These allow the water to pass through the case as the instrument\r\nsinks, so that the least amount of obstruction is offered to the descent.\r\nAt the lower end of the case is a stout brass spring, to protect the\r\ninstrument from a sudden jar if it should touch the bottom while\r\ndescending rapidly. As the instrument is drawn up, the valves close with\r\nthe weight of water upon them, and it arrives at the surface filled with\r\nwater brought up from its lowest position. The deep-sea thermometers used\r\nin the Royal Navy are of this pattern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=90. Johnson's Metallic Deep-Sea Thermometer.=--The objection to the\r\nemployment of mercurial thermometers for ascertaining the temperature of\r\nthe ocean at depths, arising from the compression of the bulbs, which was\r\nof such serious consequence previous to the modification made in the\r\nconstruction of the instrument by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, led to the\r\nconstruction of a metallic thermometer altogether free from liability of\r\ndisturbance from compression by the surrounding water; which, however, is\r\ncertainly not so sensitive to changes of temperature as mercury. This\r\ninstrument is the invention of Henry Johnson, Esq., F.R.A.S., and is thus\r\ndescribed by him:--\r\n\r\n\"During the year 1844 some experiments were made by James Glaisher, Esq.,\r\nF.R.S., on the temperature of the water of the Thames near Greenwich at\r\nthe different seasons of the year; when that gentleman found that the\r\nindications of temperature were greatly affected by the pressure on the\r\nbulbs of the thermometers. At a depth of 25 feet this pressure would be\r\nnearly equal to the presence of three-fourths of an atmosphere. These\r\nobservations demonstrate the importance of using in deep-sea soundings an\r\ninstrument free from liability of disturbance from compression by the\r\nsurrounding water, and have ultimately led to the construction of the\r\nthermometer now to be described.\r\n\r\n\"The instrument is composed of solid metals of considerable specific\r\ngravity, viz. of brass and steel, the specific gravity of these metals\r\nbeing 8.39 and 7.81 respectively. They are therefore not liable to\r\ncompression by the water, which under a pressure of 1,120 atmospheres, or\r\nat a depth of 5,000 fathoms in round numbers, acquires a density or\r\nspecific gravity of 1.06. In the construction of this instrument,\r\nadvantage has been taken of the well-known difference in the ratios of\r\nexpansion and contraction by heat and cold of brass and steel, to form\r\ncompound bars of thin bars of these metals riveted together; and which\r\nwill be found to assume a slight curve in one direction when heat has\r\nexpanded the brass more than the steel, and a slight one in the contrary\r\ndirection when cold has contracted the brass more than the steel.\r\n\r\n\"The indications of the instrument record the motions under changes of\r\ntemperature of such compound bars; in which the proportion of brass, the\r\nmore dilatable metal, is two-thirds, and of steel one-third.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.]\r\n\r\n\"Upon one end of a narrow plate of metal about a foot long, _a_, are fixed\r\nthree scales of temperature, _h_, which ascend from 25 deg. to 100 deg. F., and\r\nwhich are shown more clearly in the drawing detached from the instrument.\r\nUpon one of these scales the present temperature is shown by the pointer,\r\n_e_, which turns upon a pivot in its centre. The register index, _g_, to\r\nthe maximum temperature, and the index, _f_, to the minimum temperature,\r\nare moved along the other scales by the pin upon the moving pointer, at\r\n_e_, where they are retained by stiff friction. At equal distances from\r\nthe centre of the pointer are two connecting pieces, _d d_, by which it is\r\nattached to the free ends of two compound bars, _b b_, and its movements\r\ncorrespond with the movements of the compound bars under variations of\r\ntemperature. The other ends of the bars are fastened by the plate, _c_, to\r\nthe plate, _a_, on which the scales of temperature are fixed. The\r\nconnection of the bars with both sides of the centre of the pointer\r\nprevents disturbance of indication by lateral concussion. The case of the\r\ninstrument has been improved at the suggestion of Admiral FitzRoy, and now\r\npresents to the water a smooth cylindrical surface, with rounded ends, and\r\nwithout projection of fastenings.\r\n\r\n\"In surveying expeditions, this instrument would be found useful in giving\r\nnotice of variation of depth of water, and of the necessity for taking\r\nsoundings. A diminution of the temperature of water has been observed by\r\nscientific voyagers to accompany diminution of depth, as on nearing land,\r\nor approaching hidden rocks or shoals. Attention would also thus be\r\nattracted to the vicinity of icebergs.\"\r\n\r\nThis thermometer might easily be modified to serve for several other\r\nimportant purposes, such as the determination of the temperature of\r\nintermittent hot springs, and mud volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of this thermometer is not altogether new; but the duplicate\r\narrangement of the bars, which effectually prevents the movement of the\r\nindices by any shaking, and the application are certainly novel. Professor\r\nTrail, in the _Library of Useful Knowledge_, writes:--\"In 1803, Mr. James\r\nCrighton, of Glasgow, published a new 'metallic thermometer,' in which\r\nthe unequal expansion of zinc and iron is the moving power. A bar is\r\nformed by uniting a plate of zinc (fig. 71), _c d_, 8 inches long, 1 inch\r\nbroad, and 1/4 inch thick, to a plate of iron, _a b_, of the same length.\r\nThe lower extremity of the compound bar is firmly attached to a mahogany\r\nboard at _e e_; a pin, _f_, fixed to its upper end, plays in the forked\r\nopening in the short arm of the index, _g_. When the temperature is\r\nraised, the superior expansion of the zinc, _c d_, will bend the whole\r\nbar, as in the figure; and the index, _g_, will move along the graduated\r\narc, from right to left, in proportion to the temperature. In order to\r\nconvert it into a _register thermometer_, Crighton applied two slender\r\nhands, _h h_, on the axis of the index; these lie below the index, and are\r\npushed in opposite directions by the stud, _i_,--a contrivance seemingly\r\nborrowed from the instrument of Fitzgerald,\" a complicated metallic\r\nthermometer, described by the Professor previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nBOILING-POINT THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=91. Ebullition.=--The temperature at which a fluid _boils_ is called the\r\n_boiling-point_ of that particular fluid. It is different for different\r\nliquids; and, moreover, in the same liquid it varies with certain changes\r\nof circumstance. Thus the same liquid in various states of purity would\r\nhave its boiling temperature altered in a slight degree. There is also an\r\nintimate connection with the pressure under which a fluid is boiled, and\r\nits temperature of ebullition. Liquids boiled in the open air are\r\nsubjected to the atmospheric pressure, which is well known to vary at\r\ndifferent times and places; and the boiling-point of the liquid exhibits\r\ncorresponding changes. When the pressure is increased on the surface of\r\nany fluid, the temperature of ebullition rises; and with a decrease of\r\npressure, the boiling goes on at a lower degree of heat.\r\n\r\nIn the case of water, we commonly state the boiling-point to be 212 deg. F.;\r\nbut it is only so at the level of the sea, under the mean pressure of the\r\natmosphere, represented, in the latitude of London, by a column of 29.905\r\ninches of mercury, at a temperature of 32 deg. F., and when the water is fresh\r\nand does not contain any matter chemically dissolved in it. When steam is\r\ngenerated and confined in a boiler, the pressure upon the boiling water\r\nmay be several times greater than that of the atmosphere. Experimentally\r\nit has been found, that if the pressure in the boiler be 25 lbs. on the\r\nsquare inch, the temperature of the boiling water, and of the steam\r\nlikewise, is raised to 241 deg.; while under the exhausted receiver of an\r\nair-pump, water will boil at 185 deg., when the pressure is reduced to 17\r\ninches of mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n=92. Relation between the Boiling-Point and Elevation.=--Now, as the\r\natmospheric pressure is diminished by ascent, as shown by the fall of\r\nmercury in the barometer, it follows that in elevated localities water, or\r\nany other fluid, heated in the open air, will boil at a temperature lower\r\nthan at the sea-level. Therefore, there must be some relation between the\r\nheight of a hill, or mountain, and the temperature at which a fluid will\r\nboil at that height. Hence, the thermometer, as used to determine the\r\nboiling-point of fluids, is also an indicator of the atmospheric pressure;\r\nand may be used as a substitute for the barometer in measuring elevations.\r\n\r\nIf the atmospheric pressure were constant at the sea-level, and always the\r\nsame for definite heights, we might expect the boiling-points of fluids\r\nalso to be in exact accordance with height; and the relation once\r\nascertained, we could readily, by means of the thermometer and boiling\r\nwater, determine an unknown height, or for a known elevation assert the\r\nboiling temperature of a liquid. However, as the atmospheric pressure is\r\nperpetually varying at the same place, within certain limits, so there\r\nare, as it were, sympathetic changes in the boiling temperatures of\r\nfluids. It follows from this, that heights can never be accurately\r\nmeasured, either by the barometer or the boiling-point thermometer, by\r\nsimply observing at the places whose elevations are required. To determine\r\na height with any approach to accuracy, it is necessary that a similar\r\nobservation should be made at the same time at a lower station, not very\r\nremote laterally from the upper, and that they should be many times\r\nrepeated. When such observations have been very carefully conducted, the\r\nheight of the upper station above the lower may be ascertained with great\r\nprecision, as has been repeatedly verified by subsequent trigonometrical\r\nmeasurement of elevations so determined. If the lower station be at the\r\nsea-level, of course the absolute height of the upper is at once obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=93. Mountain Thermometer; sometimes called Hypsometric Apparatus.=--We\r\nhave now to examine the construction of the boiling-point thermometer, and\r\nits necessary appendages, as adapted for the determination of heights.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Negretti and Zambra's arrangement of the instrument is shown in\r\nfigures 72 and 73.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.]\r\n\r\nThe thermometer is made with an elongated bulb, so as to be as sensitive\r\nas possible. The scale, about a foot long, is graduated on the stem, and\r\nranges from 180 deg. to 214 deg., each degree being sufficiently large to show the\r\ndivisions of tenths of a degree. A sliding metallic vernier might perhaps\r\nwith advantage be attached to the stem, which would enable the observer to\r\nmark hundredths of a degree; which, however, he can pretty well do by\r\nestimation. The boiler is so contrived as to allow, not only the bulb, but\r\nthe stem also of the thermometer, to be surrounded by the steam. The\r\narrangement is readily understood by reference to the accompanying\r\ndiagram, fig. 73.\r\n\r\n_C_, is a copper boiler, supported by a tripod stand so as to allow a\r\nspirit-lamp, _A_, made of metal to be placed underneath. The flame from\r\nthe lamp may be surrounded by a fine wire gauze, _B_, which will prevent\r\nit being extinguished when experimenting in the external air. _E E E_, is\r\na three-drawn telescope tube, proceeding from the boiler, and open also at\r\ntop. Another tube, similarly constructed, envelops this, as shown by _D D\r\nD_. This tube is screwed to the top of the boiler, and has two openings,\r\none at the top to admit the thermometer, the other low down, _G_, to give\r\nvent to the steam. As the steam is generated, it rises in the inner tube,\r\npasses down between the tubes, and flows away at _G_. The thermometer is\r\npassed down, supported by an india-rubber washer, fitting steam tight, so\r\nas to leave the top of the mercury, when the boiling-point is attained,\r\nsufficiently visible to make the observation. The telescopic movement, and\r\nthe mode of supporting the thermometer, enable the observer always to keep\r\nthe bulb near the water, and the double tube gives all the protection\r\nrequired to obtain a steady boiling-point. Some boiling-point thermometers\r\nare constructed with their scales altogether exposed to the air, which may\r\nbe very cold, and consequently may contract to some extent the thread of\r\nmercury outside the boiler. The steam, having the same temperature as the\r\nboiling water, keeps the tube, throughout nearly its whole length, at the\r\nsame degree of heat, in the apparatus described. The whole can be packed\r\nin a tin case very compactly and securely for travelling, as in fig. 72.\r\n\r\n_Directions for Using._--When the apparatus is required for practical use,\r\nsufficient water must be poured into the boiler to fill it about one\r\nthird, through an opening, _F_, which must be afterwards closed by the\r\nscrew plug. Then apply the lighted lamp. In a short time steam will issue\r\nfrom _G_; and the mercury in the thermometer, kept carefully immersed,\r\nwill rise rapidly until it attains a stationary point, which is the\r\nboiling temperature. The observation should now be taken and recorded with\r\nas much accuracy as possible, and the temperature of the external air must\r\nbe noted at the same time by an ordinary thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe water employed should be pure. Distilled water would therefore be the\r\nbest. If a substance is held mechanically suspended in water, it will not\r\naffect the boiling-point. Thus, muddy water would serve equally as well as\r\ndistilled water. However, as it cannot be readily ascertained that nothing\r\nis dissolved chemically when water is dirty, we are only correct when we\r\nemploy pure water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=94. Precautions to ensure correct Graduation.=--Those who possess a\r\nboiling-point thermometer should satisfy themselves that it has been\r\ncorrectly graduated. To do this, it is advisable to verify it with the\r\nreading of a standard barometer reduced to 32 deg. F. The table of \"Vapour\r\nTension\" (given at p. 62) will furnish the means of comparison. Thus, if\r\nthe reduced reading of the barometer, corrected also for latitude, be\r\n29.922, the thermometer should show 212 deg. as the boiling-point of water at\r\nthe same time and place; if 29.745, the thermometer should read 211.7; and\r\nso on as per table. In this way the error of the chief point of the scale\r\ncan be obtained. Other parts of the scale may be checked with a standard\r\nthermometer, by subjecting both to the same temperature, and comparing\r\ntheir indications. The graduations as fixed by some makers are not always\r\nto be trusted; and this essential test should be conducted with the utmost\r\nnicety and care.\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy writes, in his _Notes on Meteorology_:--\"Each degree of\r\nthe boiling-point thermometer is equivalent to about 550 _feet of ascent_,\r\nor one-tenth to 55 feet; therefore, the smallest error in the graduation\r\nof the thermometer itself will affect the height deduced materially.\r\n\r\n\"In the thermometer which is graduated from 212 deg. (the boiling-point) to\r\n180 deg., similarly to those intended for the purpose of measuring heights,\r\nthere must have been a starting point, or zero, from which to begin the\r\ngraduation. I have asked an optician in London how he fixed that zero, the\r\nboiling-point. 'By boiling water at my house,' he replied. 'Where is your\r\nhouse?' In such a part of the town, he answered. I said: 'What height is\r\nit above the sea?' to which he replied, 'I do not know;' and when I asked\r\nthe state of the barometer when he boiled the water, whether the mercury\r\nwas high or low, he said that he had not looked at it! Now, as this\r\ninstrument is intended to measure heights and to decide differences of\r\nsome hundred, if not thousand feet upwards, at least one should endeavour\r\nto ascertain a reliable starting point. From inquiries made, I believe\r\nthat the determination of the boiling-point of ordinary thermometers has\r\nbeen very vague, not only from the extreme difficulties of the process\r\nitself (which are well known to opticians), but from the radical errors of\r\nnot allowing for the pressure of the atmosphere at the time of\r\ngraduation--which may be much, even an inch higher or lower, than the\r\nmean, or any _given height_--while the elevation of the place above the\r\nlevel of the sea is also unnoticed. Then there is another source of error,\r\na minor one, perhaps: the inner limit, the 180 deg. point, is fixed only by\r\ncomparison with another thermometer; it may be right, or it may be very\r\nmuch out, as may be the intermediate divisions; for the difficulty of\r\nascertaining degree by degree is great: and it must be remembered that the\r\nmeasurement of a very high mountain depends upon those inner degrees from\r\n200 deg. down to 180 deg., thereabouts. Hence, the difficulty of making a reliable\r\nobservation by boiling water seems to be greater than has been generally\r\nadmitted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=95. Method of Calculating Heights from Observations with the Mountain\r\nThermometer.=--Having considered how to make observations with the proper\r\ncare and accuracy, it becomes necessary to know how to deduce the height\r\nby calculation. That a constant intimate relation exists between the\r\nboiling temperature of water and the pressure of the air, we have already\r\nlearned. This knowledge is the result of elaborate experiments made by\r\nseveral scientific experimentalists, who have likewise constructed formulae\r\nand tables for the conversion of the boiling temperatures into the\r\ncorresponding pressures of vapour, or, which is equivalent, of the\r\natmosphere, when the operation is performed in the open air. As might be\r\nexpected, there is not a perfect accord in the results arrived at by\r\ndifferent persons. Regnault is the most recent, and his experiments are\r\nconsidered the most reliable.\r\n\r\nFrom Regnault's table of vapour tension, we can obtain the pressure in\r\ninches of mercury at 32 deg., which corresponds to the observed boiling-point;\r\nor _vice versa_, if required. From the pressure, the height may be deduced\r\nby the method for finding heights by means of the barometer.\r\n\r\nThe following table expresses very nearly the elevation in feet\r\ncorresponding to a fall of 1 deg. in the temperature of boiling water:--\r\n\r\n  Boiling Temperatures      Elevation in Feet\r\n      between.               for each Degree.\r\n\r\n  214 deg. and 210--                  520\r\n  210  and 200--                  530\r\n  200  and 190                    550\r\n  190  and 180                    570\r\n\r\nThese numbers agree very well with the results of theory and actual\r\nobservation. The assumption is that the boiling-point will be diminished\r\n1 deg. for each 520 feet of ascent until the temperature becomes 210 deg., then\r\n530 feet of elevation will lower it one degree until the water boils at\r\n200 deg., and so on; the air being at 32 deg.\r\n\r\nLet _H_ represent the vertical height in feet between two stations; _B_\r\nand _b_, the boiling-points of water at the lower and upper stations\r\nrespectively; _f_, the factor found in the above table. Then\r\n\r\n  _H_ = _f_(_B_ - _b_)\r\n\r\nFurther, let _m_ be the mean temperature of the stratum of air between the\r\nstations. Now, if the mean temperature is less than 32 deg., the column of air\r\nwill be shorter; and if greater, longer than at 32 deg. According to\r\nRegnault, air expands 1/491.13 or .002036 of its volume at 32 deg., for each\r\ndegree increase of heat. Calling the correction due to the mean\r\ntemperature of air _C_, its value will be found from the equation,\r\n\r\n  _C_ = _H_ (_m_ - 32) .002036\r\n\r\nCalling the corrected height _H'_, it will be found from the formula,\r\n\r\n            _H'_ = _H_ + _H_ (_m_ - 32) .002036\r\n  that is,  _H'_ = _H_ { 1 + (_m_ - 32) .002036 }\r\n\r\nand substituting the value of _H_,\r\n\r\n  _H'_ = _f_(_B_ - _b_) { 1 + (_m_ - 32) .002036 }\r\n\r\nStrictly, according to theoretical considerations, there is a correction\r\ndue to latitude, as in the determination of heights by the barometer; but\r\nits value is so small that it is practically of no importance.\r\n\r\nIf a barometer be observed at one of the stations, the table of vapour\r\ntensions (p. 62) will be useful in converting the pressure into the\r\ncorresponding boiling-point, or _vice versa_; so that the difference of\r\nheight may be found either by the methods employed for the boiling-point\r\nthermometer or the barometer.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be remarked that observers who have good instruments\r\nat considerable elevations, as sites on mountains or plateaus, would\r\nconfer a benefit to science, by registering for a length of time the\r\nbarometer along with the boiling temperature of water, as accurately as\r\npossible. Such observations would serve to verify the accuracy of\r\ntheoretical deductions, and fix with certainty the theoretical scale with\r\nthe barometer indications.\r\n\r\n_Example, in calculating Heights from the Observations of the\r\nBoiling-point of Water._--1. At Geneva the observed boiling-point of water\r\nwas 209 deg.335; on the Great St. Bernard it was 197 deg.64; the mean\r\ntemperature of the intermediate air was 63 deg.5; required the height of the\r\nGreat St. Bernard above Geneva.\r\n\r\nMethod by formula:--\r\n\r\n  _H'_ = _f_ (_B_ - _b_) { 1 + (_m_ - 32 deg.) .002036 }\r\n\r\nIn this case _f_ is between 530 and 550, or 540.\r\n\r\n  _B_ = 209.335          _m_ = 63.5\r\n  _b_ = 197.64                 32\r\n        -------                -----\r\n         11.695                31.5\r\n  _f_  =    540                  .002036\r\n        -------                ---------\r\n         6315.3                 0.0641340\r\n          1.064                 1\r\n        -------                 -----\r\n  _H'_ = 6719.5 feet.           1.064\r\n         ======\r\n\r\nMethod by Tables supplied with boiling-point apparatus made by Messrs.\r\nNegretti and Zambra:--\r\n\r\n  209.335 gives 1464 in Table I.\r\n  197.64      \"     7736      \"\r\n                    ----\r\n                    6272\r\n   63.5       \"        1.07 in Table II.\r\n                    ----\r\n  Height            6711\r\n                    ====\r\n\r\n\r\n=96. Thermometers for Engineers.=--_1st. Salinometer._--Under the\r\ncircumstances at which fresh water boils at 212 deg., sea water boils at\r\n213 deg.2. The boiling temperature is raised by the chemical solution of any\r\nsubstance in the water, and the more with the increase of matter\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nFrom a knowledge of this principle, marine engineers make use of the\r\nthermometer to determine the amount of salts held in solution by the water\r\nin the boilers of sea-going steamers. Common sea-water contains 1/33 of\r\nits volume of salt and other earthy matters. As evaporation proceeds, the\r\nsolution becomes proportionally stronger, and more heat is required to\r\nproduce steam. The following table from the work of Messrs. Main and\r\nBrown, on the Marine Steam-Engine, shows the relation between the\r\nboiling-point under the mean pressure of the atmosphere, or 80 inches of\r\nmercury, and the proportion of matter dissolved in the water:--\r\n\r\n  Proportion of Salt in 100 parts of water   0    Boiling-point 212 deg.\r\n            \"                     \"         1/33       \"        213.2\r\n            \"                     \"         2/33       \"        214.4\r\n            \"                     \"         3/33       \"        215.5\r\n            \"                     \"         4/33       \"        216.6\r\n            \"                     \"         5/33       \"        217.9\r\n            \"                     \"         6/33       \"        219.0\r\n            \"                     \"         7/33       \"        220.2\r\n            \"                     \"         8/33       \"        221.4\r\n            \"                     \"         9/33       \"        222.5\r\n            \"                     \"        10/33       \"        223.7\r\n            \"                     \"        11/33       \"        224.9\r\n            \"                     \"        12/33       \"        226.0\r\n\r\nWhen the salts in solution amount to 12/33, the water is saturated. It has\r\nalso been ascertained that, when a solution of 4/33 is attained,\r\nincrustation of the substances commences on the boiler. Hence, it is a\r\nrule with engineers to expel some of the boiling water, when the\r\nthermometer indicates a temperature of 216 deg., and introduce some more cold\r\nwater, in order to prevent incrustation, which not only injures the\r\nboiler, but opposes the passage of heat to the water. The thermometer used\r\nfor this purpose should be very accurately graduated, and the scale must\r\nbe considerably higher than, though it need not read much below 212 deg.\r\n\r\n_2nd. Pressure Gauge._--The elasticity of gases augments by increase of\r\ntemperature, and _vice versa_; it follows, therefore, that when steam is\r\ngenerated in a closed boiler, its temperature rises beyond the boiling\r\ntemperature of 212 deg., owing to the increased pressure upon the water. The\r\nlaw connecting the pressure and the corresponding temperature of steam is\r\nthe same as that upon which the boiling of fluids under diminished\r\natmospheric pressure takes place. Hence, the indications of the\r\nthermometer become exponents of steam pressure. Engineers are furnished,\r\nin works on the steam-engine, with tables, from which the pressure\r\ncorresponding to a given temperature, or the converse, can be obtained by\r\nmere inspection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.]\r\n\r\nFig. 74 represents the thermometer employed as a steam-pressure gauge. It\r\nis fitted in a brass case, with screw-plug and washers for closing the\r\nboiler when the thermometer is not in use. The scale shows the pressure\r\ncorresponding to the temperature, from 15 to 120 lbs., above the\r\natmospheric pressure, which is usually taken as 15 lbs. on the square\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS FOR ASCERTAINING THE HUMIDITY OF THE AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n=97. Hygrometric Substances.=--The instruments devised for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the humidity of the atmosphere are termed _hygrometers_. The\r\nearliest invented hygrometers were constructed of substances readily acted\r\nupon by the vapour in the air, such as hair, grass, seaweed, catgut, &c.,\r\nwhich all absorb moisture, and thereby increase in length, and when\r\ndeprived of it by drying they contract. Toy-like hygrometers, upon the\r\nprinciple of absorption, are still common as ornaments for mantel-pieces.\r\nA useful little instrument of this class, formed from the beard of the\r\nwild oat, is made to resemble a watch in external appearance, and is\r\ndesigned to prove the dampness or dryness of beds: a moveable hand points\r\nout on the dial the hygrometric condition of the clothes upon which the\r\ninstrument is laid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=98. Saussure's Hygrometer=, formerly used as a meteorologic instrument,\r\nbut now regarded as an ornamental curiosity, is represented in fig. 75.\r\nIts action depends upon a prepared hair, fixed at one end to the frame of\r\nthe instrument, and wound round a pulley at the other. The pulley carries\r\na pointer which has a counterpoise sufficient to keep the hair stretched.\r\nBy this means the shrinking and lengthening of the hair cause the pointer\r\nto traverse a graduated arc indicating the relative humidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.]\r\n\r\nSuch instruments, however ingenious, are not of scientific value; because\r\nthey do not admit of rigid comparison, are liable to alter in their\r\ncontractile and expansive properties, and cannot be made to indicate\r\nprecisely alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n=99. Dew-Point.=--The amount of water which the air can sustain in an\r\ninvisible form increases with the temperature; but for every definite\r\ntemperature there is a limit to the amount of vapour which can be thus\r\ndiffused. When the air is cooled, the vapour present may be more than it\r\ncan sustain; part will then be condensed as dew, rain, hail or snow,\r\naccording to the meteorologic circumstances. The temperature which the air\r\nhas when it is so fully saturated with vapour that any excess will be\r\ndeposited as dew, is called the _dew-point_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=100. Drosometer.=--\"To measure the quantity of dew deposited each night,\r\nan instrument is used called a _Drosometer_. The most simple process\r\nconsists in exposing to the open air bodies whose exact weight is known,\r\nand then weighing them afresh after they are covered with dew. According\r\nto Wells, locks of wool, weighing about eight grains, are to be preferred,\r\nwhich are to be divided [formed] into spherical masses of the diameter of\r\nabout two inches.\"--_Koemtz._\r\n\r\n\r\n=101. Humidity.=--The proportion existing between the amount of vapour\r\nactually present in the air at any time, and the quantity necessary to\r\ncompletely saturate it, is called _the degree of humidity_. It is usually\r\nexpressed in a centesimal scale, 0 being perfect dryness, and 100 complete\r\nsaturation.\r\n\r\nThe pressure, or tension, of vapour at the dew-point temperature, divided\r\nby the tension of vapour at the air temperature and the quotient\r\nmultiplied by 100, gives the degree of humidity. (Regnault's Tables should\r\nbe used.)\r\n\r\nHence the utility of instruments for determining the dew-point.\r\n\r\n\r\n=102. Leslie's Hygrometer.=--This instrument consists of a glass syphon\r\ntube, terminated with a bulb or ball at each end, turned outwards from\r\neach other, as in fig. 76. The tube is partly filled with concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid, tinged by carmine. One of the balls is covered smoothly\r\nwith fine muslin, and is kept continually moistened with pure water, drawn\r\nfrom a vase placed near it by the capillary attraction of a few strands of\r\nclean cotton-wick. The descent of the coloured liquid in the other stem\r\nwill mark the diminution of temperature caused by the evaporation of the\r\nwater from the humid surface. The drier the ambient air is, the more\r\nrapidly will the evaporation go on; and the cold produced will be greater.\r\nWhen the air is nearly saturated with moisture, the evaporation goes on\r\nslowly; the cold produced is moderate, because the ball regains a large\r\nportion of its lost heat from surrounding bodies; and the degree of\r\nrefrigeration of the ball is an index of the dryness of the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.]\r\n\r\n\"Should the water become frozen on the ball, this hygrometer will still\r\nact; for evaporation goes on from the surface of ice in proportion to the\r\ndryness of the air. Leslie estimates, that when the ball is moist, air, at\r\nthe temperature of the ball, will take up moisture equal to the\r\nsixteen-thousandth part of its weight, for each degree of his hygrometer;\r\nand as ice in melting requires one-seventh of the caloric consumed in\r\nconverting water into vapour, when the ball is frozen, the hygrometer will\r\nsink more than when wet by 1 deg. in 7 deg.; and hence, in the frozen state, we\r\nmust increase the value of the degrees one-seventh: so that each of them\r\nwill correspond to an absorption of moisture equal to\r\none-fourteen-thousandth part of the weight of the air.\r\n\r\n\"When this hygrometer stands at 15 deg., the air feels damp; from 30 deg. to 40 deg.,\r\nwe reckon it dry; from 50 deg. to 60 deg., very dry; and from 70 deg. upwards, we\r\nshould call it intensely dry. A room would feel uncomfortable, and would\r\nprobably be unwholesome, if the instrument in it did not reach 30 deg.[8] In\r\nthick fogs it keeps almost at the beginning of the scale. In winter, in\r\nour climate, it ranges from 5 deg. to 15 deg.; in summer often from 15 deg. to 55 deg.;\r\nand sometimes attains 80 deg. or 90 deg. The greatest degree of dryness ever\r\nnoticed by Leslie was at Paris, in the month of September, when the\r\nhygrometer indicated 120 deg.\"--_Professor Trail, in \"Library of Useful\r\nKnowledge.\"_\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value of the indications of this hygrometer, it should\r\nbe borne in mind that the scale adopted by Leslie was _millesimal_, that\r\nis to say, from the freezing to the boiling-point of water was divided\r\ninto a thousand parts; ten millesimal degrees are therefore equal to one\r\nof the scale of Celsius.\r\n\r\n\r\n103. DANIEL'S HYGROMETER.\r\n\r\nThis instrument was invented about the year 1820, by Professor Daniel, the\r\ndistinguished author of _Meteorological Essays_; and it entirely\r\nsuperseded all hygrometers depending upon the absorption of moisture. The\r\nform of the instrument is shown in fig. 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a glass tube, about one-eighth of an inch in diameter of\r\nbore, bent twice at right angles, and terminated, at each end, in a bulb\r\nabout one inch and a quarter in diameter. In one limb of the tube is\r\nenclosed a delicate thermometer, which descends to the centre of the\r\nadjoining bulb, which is about three-parts filled with sulphuric ether.\r\nAll the other parts of the tube are carefully freed from air, so that they\r\nare occupied by the vapour of the ether. This bulb is generally made of\r\nblack glass; the other is transparent, but covered with a piece of fine\r\nmuslin. The support for the tube has a thermometer attached, which shows\r\nthe temperature of the external air. The tube can be removed from the\r\nstand, and the parts are made to pack, with a necessary phial of ether, in\r\na small box, which can easily be got into the pocket.\r\n\r\n_How to use the Hygrometer._--This instrument gives the dew-point by\r\ndirect observation, which must be made in the following manner:--Having\r\nfixed the tube upon the stand, with the bulbs vertically downward, the\r\nether is all caused to flow into the lower ball by inclining the tube. The\r\ntemperature of the air is noted by the exposed thermometer. Then some\r\nether is poured, from a dropping tube fitting into the neck of the phial,\r\nupon the muslin-covered bulb. The rapid evaporation of this ether cools\r\nthe bulb and causes condensation of the ethereal vapour in its interior.\r\nThis gives rise to rapid evaporation of the ether in the lower bulb,\r\nwhereby its temperature is greatly reduced. The air in the vicinity is\r\ndeprived of its warmth by the cold bulb, and is soon cooled to the\r\ntemperature at which it is perfectly saturated with the vapour which it\r\ncontains. Cooled ever so little below this temperature, some aqueous\r\nvapour will be condensed, and will form a dew upon the black-glass bulb.\r\nAt the first indication of the deposit of dew the reading of the internal\r\nthermometer is taken: which is the dew-point.\r\n\r\nThis hygrometer has undeniable disadvantages. The surface upon which the\r\ndew condenses is small, and requires a peculiar direction of light in\r\nwhich to see it well. The observer, having his attention on the bulb and\r\nthe thermometer, cannot always fix with precision the dew-point; and hence\r\nhe is recommended to note the temperature at the appearance and at the\r\ndisappearance of the dew, in order that the chance of error may be\r\ndiminished. Without doubt, the necessarily long continuance of the\r\nobserver near the instrument influences, to some extent, the observed\r\ntemperatures; and the difficulty of not being always able to procure pure\r\nether for the experiments is not the least of the drawbacks to the use of\r\nthe instrument. Some of these disadvantages are obviated in Regnault's\r\nhygrometer.\r\n\r\n\r\n104. REGNAULT'S CONDENSER HYGROMETER\r\n\r\n(Fig. 78) consists of a tube, _C_, made of silver, very thin, and\r\nperfectly polished; the tube is larger at one end than the other, the\r\nlarge part being 1.8 inches in depth, by 0.8 in diameter; this is fitted\r\ntightly to a brass stand, _B_, with a telescopic arrangement for adjusting\r\nwhen making an observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.]\r\n\r\nThe tube, _C_, has a small lateral tubulure, to which is attached an\r\nIndia-rubber tube, with ivory mouth-piece; this tubulure enters _C_ at\r\nright angles near the top, and traverses it to the bottom of the largest\r\npart.\r\n\r\nA delicate thermometer, _D_, is inserted through a cork, or India-rubber\r\nwasher, at the open end of the tube, _C_, the bulb of which descends to\r\nthe centre of its largest part.\r\n\r\n_G_ is an attached thermometer for taking the temperature of the air, and\r\n_F_ is a bottle containing ether.\r\n\r\n_To use the Condenser Hygrometer_, a sufficient quantity of ether is\r\npoured into the silver tube to cover the thermometer bulb: on allowing air\r\nto pass bubble by bubble through the ether, by breathing in the tube, _E_,\r\nan uniform temperature will be obtained; if the ether continues to be\r\nagitated, by breathing briskly through the tube a rapid reduction of\r\ntemperature will be the result; at the moment the ether is cooled down to\r\nthe dew-point temperature, the external surface of that portion of the\r\nsilver tube containing ether will become covered with a coating of\r\nmoisture, and the degree shown by the thermometer at that instant will be\r\nthe temperature of the dew-point.\r\n\r\nThis form of hygrometer, for ascertaining by direct observation the\r\ndew-point, is so superior to Daniell's, both from its being more certain\r\nin its indications and economical in use, that Messrs. Negretti and\r\nZambra have been induced to modify it, and reduce its price to little more\r\nthan that of a good Daniell's Hygrometer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=105. Temperature of Evaporation.=--When the air is not saturated with\r\nvapour, evaporation is going on with more or less activity, according as\r\nthe temperature is high or low, rising or falling. Now vapour cannot be\r\nformed without an expenditure of heat; as we invariably find that the\r\nprocess of evaporation lowers the temperature of the liquid from which the\r\nvapour is produced, and, by communication, that of contiguous substances\r\nalso. Thus the emigrant, crossing the line under the scorching influence\r\nof the vertical sun, wraps a wet towel round his can of water, swings it\r\nin the breeze, to evaporate the moisture of the towel, and obtains a glass\r\nof cool water. So also, European residents in India, during the hot\r\nseason, spread out mats in their apartments, and keep them wet, in order\r\nthat the evaporation may cool the air. This principle has been applied,\r\nfor the purpose of ascertaining the hygrometric condition of the air, in\r\nthe instrument known as Mason's hygrometer, or psychrometer, which is now\r\nin general use, from its simplicity, accuracy, and ease of observing.\r\n\r\n\r\n106. MASON'S HYGROMETER.\r\n\r\n=The Dry and Wet Bulb Hygrometer, or Psychrometer=, known also as Mason's\r\nhygrometer (fig. 79), consists of two parallel thermometers, as nearly\r\nidentical as possible, mounted on a wooden bracket, one marked _dry_, the\r\nother _wet_. The bulb of the wet thermometer is covered with thin muslin,\r\nand round the neck is twisted a conducting thread of lamp-wick, which\r\npasses into a vessel of water, placed at such a distance as to allow a\r\nlength of conducting thread, of about three inches; the cup or glass is\r\nplaced on one side, and a little beneath, so that the water within may not\r\naffect the reading of the _dry bulb thermometer_. In observing, the eye\r\nshould be placed on a level with the top of the mercury in the tube, and\r\nthe observer should refrain from breathing whilst taking an observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.]\r\n\r\nThe _dry_ bulb thermometer indicates the temperature of the air itself;\r\nwhile the wet bulb, cooled by evaporation, shows a lower temperature\r\naccording to the rapidity of evaporation.\r\n\r\n_To find the Dew-point._--From the readings of the two thermometers, the\r\ndew-point can be deduced by formulae (that known as Apjohn's is considered\r\nthe most theoretically true), or from the valuable Hygrometric Tables by\r\nJ. Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes in estimating the comparative humidity, the annexed\r\ntable, which is a reduction from Mr. Glaisher's elaborate work, will be\r\nsufficient; it will at least serve to assist in familiarising the\r\ninexperienced in the value of the psychrometer's indications:--\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------+\r\n  |            | Difference between Dry-bulb |\r\n  |            |    and Wet-bulb Readings.   |\r\n  |Temperature |-----------------------------|\r\n  |   by the   | 2 deg. | 4 deg. | 6 deg. | 8 deg. | 10 deg.| 12 deg.|\r\n  |  Dry Bulb  |-----------------------------|\r\n  |Thermometer.|     Degree of Humidity.     |\r\n  |------------------------------------------|\r\n  |     34 deg.    | 79 | 63 | 50 | .. | .. | .. |\r\n  |     36     | 82 | 66 | 53 | .. | .. | .. |\r\n  |     38     | 83 | 68 | 56 | 45 | .. | .. |\r\n  |     40     | 84 | 70 | 58 | 47 | .. | .. |\r\n  |     42     | 84 | 71 | 59 | 49 | .. | .. |\r\n  |     44     | 85 | 72 | 60 | 50 | .. | .. |\r\n  |     46     | 86 | 73 | 61 | 51 | .. | .. |\r\n  |     48     | 86 | 73 | 62 | 52 | 44 | .. |\r\n  |     50     | 86 | 74 | 63 | 53 | 45 | .. |\r\n  |     52     | 86 | 74 | 64 | 54 | 46 | .. |\r\n  |     54     | 86 | 74 | 64 | 55 | 47 | .. |\r\n  |     56     | 87 | 75 | 65 | 56 | 48 | .. |\r\n  |     58     | 87 | 76 | 66 | 57 | 49 | .. |\r\n  |     60     | 88 | 76 | 66 | 58 | 50 | 43 |\r\n  |     62     | 88 | 77 | 67 | 58 | 50 | 44 |\r\n  |     64     | 88 | 77 | 67 | 59 | 51 | 45 |\r\n  |     66     | 88 | 78 | 68 | 60 | 52 | 45 |\r\n  |     68     | 88 | 78 | 68 | 60 | 52 | 46 |\r\n  |     70     | 88 | 78 | 69 | 61 | 53 | 47 |\r\n  |     72     | 89 | 79 | 69 | 61 | 54 | 48 |\r\n  |     74     | 89 | 79 | 70 | 62 | 55 | 48 |\r\n  |     76     | 89 | 79 | 71 | 63 | 55 | 49 |\r\n  |     78     | 89 | 79 | 71 | 63 | 56 | 50 |\r\n  |     80     | 90 | 80 | 71 | 63 | 56 | 50 |\r\n  |     82     | 90 | 80 | 72 | 64 | 57 | 51 |\r\n  |     84     | 90 | 80 | 72 | 64 | 57 | 51 |\r\n  |     86     | 90 | 80 | 72 | 64 | 58 | 52 |\r\n  +------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of aqueous vapour which at any temperature can be\r\ndiffused in the air being represented by 100, the per-centage of vapour\r\nactually present will be found in the table opposite the temperature of\r\nthe dry thermometer, and under the difference between the dry-bulb and\r\nwet-bulb temperatures. The degree of humidity for intermediate\r\ntemperatures and differences to those given in the table can be easily\r\nestimated sufficiently accurately for most practical purposes.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two thermometer readings taken from the reading\r\nof the wet bulb, gives the dew-point very nearly, when the air is at any\r\ntemperature between freezing and 80 deg. This simple rule will be found\r\nserviceable to horticulturists, since it will enable them to estimate the\r\nchilling effect of dew or hoar-frost on tender plants.\r\n\r\n_Use as an Indicator of Weather._--In our climate, the usual difference\r\nbetween the thermometer readings,--in the open air, shaded from the sun,\r\nreflected heat, and currents of air,--ranges from one to twelve degrees.\r\nIn hot and dry climates, as India and Australia, the range out of doors\r\nhas been found as much as 30 deg., occasionally.\r\n\r\nWhen the moisture is frozen, the bulb should be wetted afresh, and the\r\nreading taken just before it again freezes; but the observation then is of\r\nlittle value, and for general purposes need not be taken, as the air is\r\nknown to be dry in frosty weather.\r\n\r\nThe muslin or cotton rag should be washed once or twice a week by pouring\r\nwater over the bulb; and it should be replaced by a fresh piece at least\r\nonce a month. Accuracy depends very much upon keeping the wet bulb clean,\r\nand not _too_ wet.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the barometer, this hygrometer is very useful, not only\r\non land, but especially at sea, where other kinds of hygrometers cannot be\r\npractically used. A fall in the barometer is indicative of coming wind or\r\nrain: if the hygrometer shows increasing dampness by the difference of the\r\nreadings becoming smaller,--rain may therefore be anticipated. On the\r\ncontrary, if the hygrometer shows continuing or increasing dryness, a\r\nstronger wind is probable, without rain.\r\n\r\n_Domestic Uses._--Mason's hygrometer is useful in regulating the moisture\r\nof the air of apartments; a difference in the thermometer readings of from\r\n5 deg. to 8 deg. being considered healthy. Many complaints require that the\r\ntemperature and humidity of the air which the invalid breathes should be\r\ncarefully regulated. Hence it is a valuable household instrument. In a\r\nroom, it should be placed away from the fire as much as possible, but not\r\nexposed to draughts of air.\r\n\r\nFigs. 80 and 81 show cheap arrangements of the instrument for domestic\r\npurposes. Other arrangements are given to the instrument to make it\r\nsuitable for exhibiting the hygrometrical state of the air in hot-houses,\r\nconservatories, malting-houses, warehouses, manufactories, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.]\r\n\r\nFig. 82 shows the instrument arranged on brass tripod stand, with folding\r\nlegs and metal cover, to render it portable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=107. Self-Registering Hygrometer.=--A maximum thermometer and a minimum\r\nthermometer, each fitted up as a wet-bulb thermometer, record the highest\r\nand lowest temperature of evaporation during the interval of observation.\r\nNegretti's mercurial maximum, and an alcohol minimum, answer best.\r\n\r\n\r\n=108. Causes of Dew.=--\"The aqueous vapour of our atmosphere is a powerful\r\nradiant; but it is diffused through air which usually exceeds its own mass\r\nmore than one hundred times. Not only, then, its own heat, but the heat of\r\nthe large quantity of air which surrounds it, must be discharged by the\r\nvapour, before it can sink to its point of condensation. The retardation\r\nof chilling due to this cause enables good solid radiators, at the earth's\r\nsurface, to outstrip the vapour in their speed of refrigeration; and\r\nhence, upon these bodies, aqueous vapour may be condensed to liquid, or\r\neven congealed to hoar-frost, while at a few feet above the surface it\r\nstill maintains its gaseous state.\"[9] The amount of moisture so deposited\r\nwill vary with different atmospheric conditions. If the sky be decidedly\r\ncloudy or misty, the heat radiated from the earth will be partly restored\r\nby counter-radiation from the visible vapour; the cooling of the earth's\r\nsurface will, therefore, take place slowly, and little dew will be\r\ndeposited. On the other hand, if the air contain transparent vapour, and\r\nthe sky appear clear, the counter-radiation will be less, the earth will\r\ncool rapidly, and the deposit of dew will be copious; provided the night\r\nbe comparatively calm, for, when the wind blows, the circulating air\r\nsupplies heat to the radiating substances, and prevents any considerable\r\nchilling.\r\n\r\nThe dew which falls in tropical countries greatly exceeds in abundance\r\nwhat we experience in our climate; because the air is there, from the\r\ngreat heat, capable of sustaining a large amount of vapour in the\r\ntransparent state, and the conditions most favourable for a maximum\r\nreduction of temperature by radiation are present. At those places, or\r\nupon those substances which cool the lowest and most readily, the dew\r\nfalls most copiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.]\r\n\r\n=109. Plan of Exposing Thermometers=, &c.--Figure 83 is an illustration of\r\na convenient slab for supporting thermometers in an exposed position\r\nattached to a stand (such as Glaisher's, described in Chapter XVI.) for\r\nordinary scientific observations. It has a projecting ledge, _B_, to carry\r\noff rain from the instruments, the slab, _A_, being erected vertically.\r\nThe hygrometer is placed at _E_, with the vase of water at _F_. An alcohol\r\nminimum thermometer is represented at _C_, in the position most favourable\r\nto its certain action; and at _D_ is shown one of Negretti & Zambra's\r\nmaximum thermometers, the position of which may be more nearly horizontal\r\nthan there exhibited, although a slight depression of the bulb-end of the\r\nframe is desirable, but not necessary, as this thermometer can be used in\r\nany position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS USED FOR MEASURING THE RAINFALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instruments in use for measuring the quantity of rain which falls on a\r\ngiven spot are of very simple construction. Perhaps the simplest is:--\r\n\r\n\r\n=110. Howard's Rain-Gauge.=--It consists of a copper funnel, a stout glass\r\nor stone bottle, and a measuring glass. The bottle is to be placed upon\r\nthe ground, with the funnel resting on its neck. A brass band or cylinder\r\nfixed upon the outer surface of the funnel envelops the neck of the\r\nbottle, and the pipe of the funnel extends nearly to the bottom of the\r\nbottle; so that loss by evaporation is avoided as much as possible. The\r\nreceiving space of the funnel is formed by a brass ring, five inches in\r\ndiameter, very accurately turned. The measuring vessel enables the\r\nobserver to note the rainfall in inches, tenths, and hundredths of an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.]\r\n\r\n=111. Glaisher's Rain-Gauge.=--The rain-gauge designed by Mr. Glaisher,\r\nthe well-known meteorologist, and used by most observers of the present\r\nday, is arranged for the reception of the water which falls upon its\r\nreceiving surface only, and for the prevention of loss by evaporation. The\r\nrain is first collected in a funnel, _B_, (fig. 84,) the receiving surface\r\nof which is turned in a lathe. The conical surface of the funnel slopes to\r\nthe pipe, _E_, at an angle of 60 deg. from the horizontal receiving surface.\r\nThe tube, _E_, is of small aperture, and is bent up, in order to retain\r\nthe last few drops of rain, so that the only opening for the escape of\r\nvapour may be closed as long as possible. The funnel, _B_, fits upon the\r\ncylinder, _A_, tightly in the groove, _D_. A copper can is placed inside\r\nthe cylinder, _A_, to receive the rain from the funnel. Once or twice a\r\nday, or after a shower, this can should be taken out, and the water\r\nmeasured in the glass measure, _C_, which is graduated to hundredths of an\r\ninch, according to the calculated quantity of water, determined by the\r\narea of the receiving space. In use, this gauge should be partly sunk in\r\nthe ground, so that the top may be about five inches above it. Thus\r\nsituated, there will be little or no evaporation from it during any month\r\nof the year; and the readings need not be taken daily, although desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=112. Rain-Gauge with Float.=--In this construction the graduated glass\r\nmeasure is dispensed with. The cylinder of the gauge is made less in\r\ndiameter than the funnel, and a hollow, very flattened spheroid of copper\r\nforming a float, and carrying a vertical graduated boxwood scale which\r\nmoves through the orifice of the funnel, is placed in it. As the rain\r\naccumulates the float rises, and the amount of rain in the gauge is read\r\nupon the scale from the top of the gauge, a bar, having a hole at the\r\ncentre for the passage of the scale, being fixed diametrically across the\r\nreceiving space of the funnel. The gauge is provided at the bottom with a\r\nbrass cock, by which the water may be allowed to flow out of it whenever\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis form of gauge is not very suitable for the measurement of small\r\nquantities; but is admirably adapted for localities where the rainfall is\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.]\r\n\r\n=113. Rain-Gauge with Side-Tube.=--This instrument, as represented in fig.\r\n85, is a cylindrical vessel, mounted on a base shaped as a frustum of a\r\ncone. This base may be filled with sand or gravel to make the instrument\r\nstable, so that when placed upon a lawn or in a garden it may have an\r\nornamental appearance. The funnel for collecting the rain is larger in\r\ndiameter than the cylinder. Parallel to the cylinder, and communicating\r\nwith the lowest part of the interior and extending to its top, is a\r\ngraduated glass tube, open at both ends. The rain collected will rise as\r\nhigh in this tube as in the cylinder, and its amount can therefore be read\r\noff without any trouble. The gauge is emptied by the brass tap at the\r\nbottom of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n=114. Admiral FitzRoy's Rain-Gauge.=--A form of rain-gauge, very well\r\nadapted for expeditious observation at any time, has been designed by\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy, and extensively employed by his observers. It is\r\ncylindrical in shape, with the funnel let into the top; and the rainfall\r\nis collected in an inner and much smaller cylinder, so that a small fall\r\nis represented by a considerable depth of water in the gauge. The amount\r\nof rain which has fallen is ascertained by a dipping tube, similar in\r\nprinciple to the dipping syphon used by gaugers for taking out specimens\r\nof wines or spirits from casks by simply removing the bung. A short,\r\nvertical, tubular opening provided with a cap, which is attached to the\r\ninstrument by a chain that it may not be lost, is formed in the funnel.\r\nThe measuring tube, which has a small hole at each end, should be placed\r\nupright in the gauge; then the thumb should be pressed over the upper\r\naperture, while the tube is lifted gently out, holding in the lower part a\r\nquantity of water representing the depth of the rain in the gauge, the\r\nupper edge of which is at the mark to be read off. The glass tube is\r\ngraduated to inches and tenths; hundredths of an inch can be readily\r\nestimated by the eye. The marks are fixed by actual trial with a standard\r\ngauge, and are artificial, not true, inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n=115. Self-Registering Rain-Gauge.=--The rain-gauge can be combined with\r\nclock-work and other mechanism so as to be self-recording of the amount of\r\nrain, the time, and duration of its fall. For the details of construction\r\nthe reader is referred to the next chapter, where he will find the\r\ninstrument described in connection with Osler's anemometer, as the\r\n\"pluviometer.\" To observe and duly record the times of commencement and\r\ntermination of rain is very desirable. Scarcely any observer can attempt\r\nto do this even approximately from personal observation. Hence the want of\r\na cheap and simple self-recording rain-gauge is much felt, the present\r\nconstruction being too expensive for all but a few individuals.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, Mr. R. Strachan estimated the duration and amount of rain in\r\nLondon (Gray's Inn Road) as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |  MONTHS.  |INCHES.|DAYS.|HOURS.||  MONTHS.   |INCHES.|DAYS.|HOURS.|\r\n  |-----------+-------+-----+------++------------+-------+-----+------|\r\n  |January.   | 1.86  | 19  |  88  ||July.       | 2.27  | 17  |  68  |\r\n  |February.  | 0.37  |  9  |  25  ||August.     | 2.45  | 12  |  72  |\r\n  |March.     | 3.40  | 22  | 130  ||September.  | 1.70  | 12  |  55  |\r\n  |April.     | 2.34  | 14  |  80  ||October.    | 3.23  | 21  |  94  |\r\n  |May.       | 3.04  | 16  |  90  ||November.   | 1.12  | 10  |  53  |\r\n  |June.      | 2.45  | 20  |  83  ||December.   | 1.44  | 17  |  66  |\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\"During the year 1862, the rainfall amounted to 25.67 inches. Rain fell on\r\n179 days, that is, on nearly every other day. The hours of rain were\r\nestimated at 904; therefore, if the rain had fallen continuously, it would\r\nhave lasted nearly 38 days and nights.\"[10] The value of similar estimates\r\nof the rainfall by numerous observers would be very great to meteorology.\r\n\r\n\r\n=116. The principle of measurement= in all these gauges is the relation\r\nexisting between the areas of the collecting and receiving surfaces; that\r\nis, between the area of the funnel into which the rain falls, and the area\r\nof the cylinder which receives it. In Howard's and Glaisher's gauges, this\r\ncylinder is virtually the measuring glass itself; in the others, above\r\ndescribed, the measuring scales show the same depth of water as in the\r\ncylinder of the gauge.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder being of less diameter than the funnel, and receiving all the\r\nrain collected by the funnel, it follows that its contents will have an\r\nincreased depth. Now equal cylindrical volumes, having different\r\ndiameters, are to each other in length inversely as the squares of the\r\ndiameters. Hence, if the funnel be 9 inches and the cylinder 3 inches in\r\ndiameter, a fall of 1 inch of rain will be represented in the gauge by 9\r\ninches; for 3 squared : 9 squared :: 1 : _x_ = 9. In this case, therefore, a length of\r\nnine inches of the measuring glass, tube, or scale, would represent an\r\ninch of rainfall, and be divided into tenths and hundredths of the\r\nartificial inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n=117. Position for Rain-Gauge, &c.=--Rain gauges should be placed on the\r\nground, in any position exposed to a free fall of rain, snow, or hail,\r\nwhere neither walls, buildings, nor trees shelter or cause eddies of wind.\r\nThey should be supported by a frame, or other means, to prevent them being\r\nblown down by the wind, but so that they can be readily emptied.\r\n\r\nDuring snow or frost, the gauge must be watched, and its contents melted\r\nby placing it in a warm room, either when the amount is to be measured, or\r\nthe funnel is filled up with snow. A tin vessel of equal area to the\r\nfunnel may at such times be useful as a substitute.\r\n\r\nRain gauges are constructed of metal, usually copper, which, besides being\r\nreadily workable, is little affected by atmospheric influences. If made of\r\niron or zinc, they should be well japanned; if of copper, this is not so\r\nessential. The capacity of a gauge should be sufficient to contain at\r\nleast the probable maximum fall of rain in a day at the locality. Those\r\nrequired for rainy districts must be of large size.\r\n\r\n\r\n=118. Causes of Rain.=--When the invisible vapour which is diffused in the\r\natmosphere becomes sufficiently cooled, it appears visible as mist or\r\ncloud, and a further reduction of temperature causes its precipitation as\r\nrain, hail, or snow. The cooling of the higher regions of the atmosphere\r\nis doubtless the chief cause of this condensation; but the property which\r\naqueous vapour possesses of radiating heat may also contribute to the\r\nresult. Moreover, the law which regulates the amount of vapour which air\r\nat any particular temperature can sustain in a transparent state,\r\ndetermines that when two bodies of air at different temperatures,\r\nsaturated with vapour, intermix, some moisture must be rendered visible;\r\nand hence, it is not only possible, but highly probable, that rain may\r\nresult from the conflict of different winds. Let us imagine two cubic\r\nyards of air, both saturated with moisture, but having the respective\r\ntemperatures of 50 and 70 degrees, to come into contact. There will be a\r\ntendency to equalize the temperature to a mean, which is 60 deg.; and during\r\nthis process, some of the vapour will be condensed.\r\n\r\n  For in the air at 50 deg. there is                     110.7 grains of vapour[11]\r\n  and       \"       70      \"                        216.0       \"\r\n                                                    ------\r\n  Total amount of vapour                             326.7       \"\r\n  But two cubic yards of air at 60 deg. can only sustain 313.2       \"\r\n                                                    ------\r\n  Hence there will be deposited                       13.5       \" of rain.\r\n                                                    ======\r\n\r\nIt may be conceded, therefore, that when a warm and moist current of air\r\nencounters a body of cold air which may not be extremely dry, the mixture\r\nis unable to retain the whole of the vapour in an invisible state; so that\r\nthe excess becomes visible as mist or fog, and, when the temperature has\r\nbecome sufficiently lowered, rain. The British Isles are more or less\r\nenveloped in fog, or mist, at the commencement of easterly winds, which,\r\nwith a sudden change of wind, is exhibited even in summer; while the\r\nsouth-westerly winds, warm, and arriving from the ocean, deposit large\r\nquantities of rain by the cooling effect of the land, colder by reason of\r\nits latitude. When rain occurs with a northerly wind, it is probably due\r\nto the deposition from an upper south-westerly current, often apparently\r\nproved by the movements of the upper clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=119. Laws of Rain-fall.=--Tropical countries have a dry and a wet season\r\nduring the year: _dry_, when the sun is at the opposite side of the\r\nequator; _wet_, when the sun is overhead. With reference to the British\r\nIsles, the statistics collected by Mr. G. J. Symons indicate that: 1st.\r\nThe stations of least rain are inland, or on the east or south-east\r\ncoasts; the stations of greatest rain are on the western coasts. 2nd. The\r\nrain-fall is very large in the vicinity of mountain chains or groups,\r\nunless the station happens to be some miles to the north-eastward.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to illustrate these remarks by quoting[12] the average fall\r\nat a few places, grouping them as--\r\n\r\n      Westerly.\r\n                           Inches.\r\n  Bodmin                    43\r\n  Bolton (Lancashire)       44\r\n  Coniston (Windermere)     71\r\n  Seathwaite               127\r\n  Torosay (I. of Mull)      75\r\n  Killaloe (Limerick)       38\r\n\r\n     Central.\r\n                           Inches.\r\n  Enfield                   23\r\n  Epping                    23\r\n  Derby                     24\r\n  York                      22\r\n  Stirling                  39\r\n  Perth                     29\r\n\r\n     Easterly.\r\n                           Inches.\r\n  Witham (Essex)            21\r\n  Patrington (Hull)         21\r\n  Sunderland                17\r\n  Inveresk (Edinburgh)      25\r\n  Pittenweem (Fife)         24\r\n  Dublin                    22\r\n\r\nMr. Green, the celebrated aeronaut, has asserted from his experience,\r\n\"that whenever a fall of rain happens, and the sky is entirely overcast,\r\nthere will invariably be found to exist another stratum of cloud at a\r\ncertain elevation above the former;\" and the recent scientific balloon\r\nascents by Mr. Glaisher have tended to confirm this theory. Mr. Glaisher\r\nsays, \"It would seem to be an established fact, that whenever rain is\r\nfalling from an overcast sky, there is a second stratum above.\" \"It would\r\nalso seem that when the sky is overcast without rain, that there is no\r\nstratum of cloud above, but that the sun is shining on the upper surface.\r\nIn every instance in which I have been up under these circumstances, I\r\nhave found such to be the case, agreeing in this respect also with Mr.\r\nGreen's observations.\"\r\n\r\nThe amount of rain collected in a gauge placed near the surface of the\r\nearth is larger than in any gauge placed above it; and the higher the\r\ngauge is placed, the less water is collected. Mr. Glaisher contends that\r\nhis balloon experiments corroborate this law.\r\n\r\n\r\n=120. Utility of Statistics of Rain-fall.=--The utility of knowing the\r\nrain-fall of any locality is sufficiently obvious, and little need be said\r\nupon the subject. The rain-gauge should be in the hands of every gardener\r\nand farmer. In the management of out-door plants and crops, as well as in\r\nthe construction of cisterns and tanks for the supply of water, a rain\r\ngauge is a valuable assistant. By its use, the gardener will be guided in\r\njudging how far the supply of moisture to the earth is needed; and he will\r\nalso see how beneficial is even a hasty shower to growing plants, when he\r\nconsiders that a fall of rain measuring the tenth of an inch in depth,\r\ncorresponds to the deposit of about forty hogsheads per acre. The study of\r\nthe rain-fall of a country is of considerable interest to agriculturists.\r\nThe health and increase of domestic animals, the development of the\r\nproductions of the land, as well as the daily labours of the farmer, are\r\ndependent upon the excess or deficiency of rain. \"It must be a subject of\r\ngreat satisfaction and confidence to the husbandman to know at the\r\nbeginning of a summer, by the certain evidence of meteorological results\r\non record, that the season, in the ordinary course of things, may be\r\nexpected to be a dry and warm one; or to find, in a certain period of it,\r\nthat the average quantity of rain to be expected for the month has fallen.\r\nOn the other hand, when there is reason, from the same source of\r\ninformation, to expect much rain, the man who has courage to begin his\r\noperations under an unfavourable sky, but with good ground to conclude,\r\nfrom the state of his instruments and his collateral knowledge, that a\r\nfair interval is approaching, may often be profiting by his observations;\r\nwhile his cautious neighbour who waited 'for the weather to settle' may\r\nfind that he has let the opportunity go by. This superiority, however, is\r\nattainable by a very moderate share of application to the subject; and by\r\nthe keeping of a plain diary of the barometer and rain-gauge, with the\r\nhygrometer and vane, under his daily notice.\"[13] The statistics of\r\nrain-fall are not only valuable and interesting in a meteorological point\r\nof view, and for agricultural purposes, but are also highly important in\r\nconnection with sanitary arrangements for towns, and engineering\r\noperations. This is especially evident to the hydraulic engineer. As rain\r\nis an important source of water-supply to rivers, canals, and reservoirs,\r\nit is evident that a knowledge of the probable fall for any season or\r\nmonth, at a given place, as furnished by averages of the observations of\r\nformer years, will be the data upon which the engineer will base his plans\r\nfor providing for floods or droughts; while the measurement of the actual\r\nquantity which has just fallen, as gathered from the indications of a\r\nseries of gauges, will suggest to him the precautions to adopt either to\r\neconomise or conduct away the in-pouring waters.\r\n\r\n\"When a canal is conducted across an undulating country, its course is\r\nnecessarily governed by the accidents of the ground, and it alternately\r\nrises and falls. In this case, rising by a succession of levels, it\r\nnecessarily arrives at a certain highest level, which is called by\r\nengineers the _summit level_. From this it again descends by a\r\ncorresponding series of levels. Now, it is evident that, supposing the\r\nlocks to be all equal in magnitude, the ascent of a vessel will require\r\nthe descent of as much water from the summit to the lowest level as would\r\nfill a single lock; for this quantity of water must be discharged from\r\neach lock of the series when the vessel passes through it.\r\n\r\n\"The same may be said of the process by which the vessel descends along\r\nthe series of locks on the other side of the summit. It appears,\r\ntherefore, that a supply of water must always be maintained on the summit\r\nlevel sufficient to fill a single lock twice for each vessel which crosses\r\nthe summit.\r\n\r\n\"It happens, fortunately, that by the laws of natural evaporation, rain is\r\nprecipitated in greater quantities on elevated summits than on the\r\nintermediate valleys, so that the moving power, in this case, accommodates\r\nitself to the exigencies of intercommunication.\"--_Dr. Lardner's \"Handbook\r\nof Natural Philosophy.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n=121. New Form of Rain-Gauge.=--Since the foregoing pages were in type, a\r\nmodification of Howard's rain-gauge has been arranged by Mr. Symons, which\r\nis compact in design, convenient in use, and low in price. It combines the\r\nadvantages of most gauges; having solidity, and facility of measurement.\r\nThe bottle is placed in a tin case, to the bottom of which are attached\r\nstout spikes, which, when forced into the earth, prevent its being upset\r\neither by wind or accident. The bottle being transparent, and slits made\r\nin the case, the fall of rain is seen at a glance, or with a race-glass,\r\nfrom a window. The funnel being attached to the cover of the case is\r\nthereby kept strictly horizontal, and the depth of rain can be accurately\r\nmeasured by lifting the bottle from its case and emptying it into a\r\ngraduated glass jar.\r\n\r\nThe funnel of this gauge is a very deep cone, to prevent the rain drops\r\noutsplashing. When properly placed, the receiving surface will be twelve\r\ninches above the ground, which experience has shown to be the most\r\nadvantageous height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS EMPLOYED FOR REGISTERING THE DIRECTION, PRESSURE, AND VELOCITY\r\nOF THE WIND.\r\n\r\n\r\n=122. The Vane.=--The instrument by which the wind's direction is most\r\ngenerally noted, is the vane, or weather-cock, and all that need be said\r\nof it here is that the points north, east, south and west, usually\r\nattached to it, should indicate the _true_ and not the _magnetic_\r\ndirections; and that care should be taken to prevent its setting fast.\r\nVery complicated instruments are required for ascertaining the pressure\r\nand velocity of the wind, and these are called _Anemometers_. The simplest\r\nis _Lind's_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.]\r\n\r\n=123. Lind's Anemometer, or Wind-Gauge= (fig. 86), invented so late as\r\n1775, for showing the pressure of the wind, consists of a glass syphon,\r\nthe limbs parallel to each other, and each limb the same diameter. One end\r\nof the syphon is bent at right angles to the limb, so as to present a\r\nhorizontal opening to the wind. A graduated scale, divided to inches and\r\ntenths, is attached to the syphon tube, reading either way from a zero\r\npoint in the centre of the scale. The whole instrument is mounted on a\r\nspindle, surmounted by a vane, and is moved freely in any direction by the\r\nwind, always presenting the open end towards the quarter from which the\r\nwind blows. To use the instrument, it is simply filled up to the zero\r\npoint with water, and then exposed to the wind; the difference in the\r\nlevel of the water gives the force of the wind in inches and tenths, by\r\nadding together the amount of depression in one limb, and elevation in the\r\nother, the _sum of the two_ being the height of a column of water which\r\nthe wind is capable of sustaining at that time.\r\n\r\nTABLE,\r\n\r\nShowing the Force of Wind on a square foot, for different heights of the\r\ncolumn of Water in Lind's Wind-Gauge.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------+\r\n  |Inches.|Force in|Common designation|\r\n  |       |  lbs.  |   of such Wind.  |\r\n  |-------+--------+------------------|\r\n  |  6    |  31.75 | A Hurricane.     |\r\n  |  5    |  26.04 | A violent Storm. |\r\n  |  4    |  20.83 | A great Storm.   |\r\n  |  3    |  15.62 | A Storm.         |\r\n  |  2    |  10.42 | A strong Wind.   |\r\n  |  1    |   5.21 | A high Wind.     |\r\n  |   .5  |   2.60 | A brisk Wind.    |\r\n  |   .1  |    .52 | A fresh Breeze.  |\r\n  |   .05 |    .26 | A gentle Breeze. |\r\n  | 0.    |   0.   | A Calm.          |\r\n  +-----------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n=124. Modification of Lind's Gauge.=--_Sir W. Snow Harris_ has effected a\r\nmodification of Lind's anemometer, with a view of obtaining a hand\r\ninstrument for use at sea more especially. At present the force of the\r\nwind is estimated at sea by an arbitrary scale, suggested by Sir F.\r\nBeaufort, the late hydrographer; 0 being calm, 12 the strongest hurricane,\r\nand the intermediate numerals giving the varying strength of the wind.\r\nThere has been a long-felt want of instrumental means for obtaining this\r\ndata at sea, if merely for the sake of checking occasionally personal\r\nestimations, which may vary considerably among different observers.\r\nHarris's wind gauge is intended to be held by hand, while facing the wind,\r\nand keeping it in proper position by attending to a spirit-level attached.\r\nWhen in position, and held firmly, the tube has to be opened to the wind\r\nby pressure of the thumb acting upon jointed levers, controlled by\r\nsprings. The pressure of the wind moves the enclosed liquid; and by\r\nwithdrawing the thumb, the tube is closed so as to keep the liquid in its\r\nposition; the reading is then taken from its scale, either in pounds on\r\nthe square foot, miles per hour, or the ordinary designations of wind, as\r\nlight, fresh, strong, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n=125. Robinson's Anemometer.=--_Dr. Robinson_, of Armagh, is the inventor\r\nof a very successful anemometer, which determines the horizontal velocity\r\nof the wind. It was first used in 1850, in the meteorological and tidal\r\nobservations made on the coast of Ireland under the direction of the Rev.\r\nDr. Lloyd. No meteorological observatory should be without this valuable\r\ninstrument, which is essential in determining the average velocity of the\r\nwind of a locality as distinguished from the most frequent wind of the\r\nsame place. It is represented in fig. 87. Four hollow hemispherical cups,\r\n_A A_, are extended upon conjugate diameters, or arms, with their\r\ndiametrical planes placed vertically, and facing the same way upon a\r\nvertical axis, _B_, which has at its lower extremity an endless screw,\r\n_D_. The axis is supported at _C_ so as to turn with as little friction as\r\npossible. The endless screw is placed in gear with a train of wheels and\r\npinions. Each wheel carries an index over a stationary dial in front; or\r\nthe index is fixed, and the graduations are placed upon the wheels\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.]\r\n\r\nDr. Robinson has proved, both by theory and experiment, that the centre of\r\nany one of the cups so mounted and set in motion by the wind, revolves\r\nwith one-third of the wind's velocity. If, therefore, the diametrical\r\ndistance between the centres of the cups be one foot, the circle described\r\nby the centres in one revolution is 3.1416 feet, and the velocity of the\r\nwind will be three times this, or 9.42 feet, which must be referred to\r\ntime for the absolute rate. The instrument is sometimes made with the\r\ncentres of the cups 1.12 feet apart, so that the circle described is\r\n1/1500 of a mile in circumference. Hence, to produce one revolution of the\r\ncups, the wind must travel three times as fast, or 1/500 of a mile.\r\nTherefore, 500 revolutions will be produced by one mile of wind; so that\r\nthe dials may be graduated to register the velocity in miles and tenths of\r\nmiles. The simplest arrangement is with five dials, recording respectively\r\n10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000 revolutions.\r\n\r\n_Directions for using Robinson's Anemometer._--The dials read off in the\r\nsame manner as the register of a gas meter, commencing with the dial\r\nfarthest from the endless screw.\r\n\r\n\"The figures on the first dial indicate so many hundreds of thousands of\r\nrevolutions; those on the second dial so many tens of thousands; those on\r\nthe third, thousands; those on the fourth, hundreds; and those on the\r\nfifth so many tens.\r\n\r\n\"The instrument should be read every morning at 9 o'clock; and, usually,\r\nit will only be necessary to read the first three dials. The figures can\r\nbe entered as they are read off. Should the index point _between_ two\r\nfigures, the less of the two is to be taken.\r\n\r\n\"For example, if the first dial points to 7, or between 7 and 8; while the\r\nsecond dial indicates 4; and the third, 5; the entry to be made is 745\r\n(indicative of 745 _thousand_ revolutions).\r\n\r\n\"Every time the index of the first dial is found to have passed zero (0),\r\na cross or star is to be prefixed to the next (a lower) reading.\r\n\r\n\"To ascertain how many _thousands_ of revolutions have been made during\r\nthe month, it will simply be necessary to subtract the first reading from\r\nthe last, and prefix to the three figures thus obtained a figure\r\ncorresponding to the number of stars in the column. For every _thousand_\r\nrevolutions there are two miles of wind: we have therefore only to\r\nmultiply by 2 to find how many miles of wind have passed during the month.\r\n\r\n\"Two entries must be made for the last day of each month (the one being\r\nwritten under the other), so as to bring the readings down to 9 A.M. on\r\nthe 1st of the following month. The same entry which ends one month, will\r\ntherefore begin the next. This repetition of one entry is necessary, in\r\norder to prevent losing a day's wind.\r\n\r\n  \"The accompanying example of the           687\r\n  readings of an Anemometer for 13 days      773\r\n  will illustrate the method of making       822\r\n  the entries, &c.                           855\r\n                                             900\r\n  \"In this instance, the first reading       953\r\n  (687) is less than the last (793).         990\r\n  When the first reading is greater than    *066\r\n  the last, it will be necessary to borrow   197\r\n  1,000 in making the subtractions,          323\r\n  and then deduct one from the number        414\r\n  of stars. Thus, if the first reading       597\r\n  of the series on the margin had            712\r\n  been 887, the result would have been       793\r\n  906 instead of 1106.                      ----\r\n                                            1106 thousands of revolutions.\r\n                                               2\r\n                                          +-----\r\n                                       13 | 2212 miles of wind in period.\r\n                                          +-----\r\n                                             170 miles of wind per day, on\r\n                                                 an average.\r\n\r\n\"The foregoing directions are all which require to be regularly attended\r\nto. But it may be interesting at times to find the velocity of the wind\r\nduring a period of a few minutes. This may be ascertained by observing the\r\ndifference of two readings of all the dials, with an interval of some\r\nminutes between them, when a very brief calculation will suffice; but\r\nperhaps the simplest method is the following:--\r\n\r\n\"Take two readings, with an interval of 12 minutes between them. The\r\ndifference of these readings, divided by 10, is the velocity of the wind\r\nin miles per hour. Thus--if the reading of the five dials (from left to\r\nright) at noon is 15206, and at 12 minutes past 12 is 15348, the velocity\r\nof the wind is 14.2 miles per hour.\"--_Admiral FitzRoy, F.R.S._\r\n\r\nA lever and clutch are sometimes fitted to this anemometer, as in fig. 88,\r\nfor throwing the train out of gear when not required to register. It may\r\nalso be connected with clock-work so as to be self-recording, by causing\r\nthe mechanism to impress a mark upon prepared paper moved by the\r\napparatus, at certain intervals of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.]\r\n\r\nThis anemometer should be fixed in an exposed situation, as high above\r\nground as may be convenient for reading. It may be made very portable, by\r\nthe arms which carry the cups being fitted to unscrew or to fold down.\r\nWhen fitted in gimbals, it can be used at sea with much advantage.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the wind has been experimentally proved to vary as the\r\nsquare of the velocity; the relation being _V squared_ = 200 x _P_. From this\r\nformula, therefore, the pressure can be calculated corresponding to the\r\nobserved velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=126. Whewell's Anemometer.=--This apparatus, the invention of the\r\ncelebrated Dr. W. Whewell, registers the horizontal motion of the air with\r\nthe direction. Its mechanism may be described in general terms, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nA horizontal brass plate is attached to a vertical spindle, which passes\r\nthrough the axis of a fixed cylinder, being supported by a bearing at the\r\nlower end, and working in a collar at the upper. A vane is attached, by\r\nwhich the plate is moved about according to the direction of the wind. A\r\nfly, having eight fans, each fixed at an angle of 45 deg. with the axle, is\r\nplaced upon the plate so that the axle is in the line of direction of the\r\nvane. An endless screw on the axle turns a vertical wheel having one\r\nhundred teeth, the axle to which has also an endless screw working into a\r\nhorizontal wheel, having a like number of teeth, and which communicates\r\nmotion to a vertical screw fifteen inches long. On this screw is placed a\r\nmoveable nut, which carries a pencil. Round the cylinder is wrapped daily\r\na paper divided for the points of the compass. The wind acting upon the\r\nvane will cause the plate to turn; and the screw which carries the pencil\r\nwill travel with it, so that the pencil will mark upon the paper the\r\ndirection of the wind. The fly will also be set in motion, and thereby the\r\nnut upon the screw will descend, so that the attached pencil will trace a\r\nvertical line upon the paper. When the fans on the axle are 2.3 inches\r\nfrom axis to end, and 1.9 inches wide, and the thread of the screw such\r\nthat forty-five revolutions will cause the nut to descend two inches,\r\n75.85 miles of wind will cause the pencil to descend through a vertical\r\nspace of two inches; but the actual trace upon the paper will be longer in\r\nproportion to the magnitude of change of azimuth, or direction, of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=127. Osler's Anemometer, and Pluviometer.=--Mr. Follet Osler is the\r\ninventor of a self-recording apparatus which registers the direction and\r\npressure of the wind, and the amount and duration of rain, upon the same\r\nsheet of paper. His apparatus has met with very much approbation, and has\r\nbeen erected in many observatories. The mechanism may be modified in\r\nvarious ways, and the following is a description of the simplest and most\r\nrecent arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument, of which fig. 89 is a diagram rather than a picture,\r\nconsists, first, of a vane, _V_, of a wedge-shape form, which is found to\r\nanswer better than a flat vane; for the latter is always in a neutral\r\nline, and therefore is not sufficiently sensitive. A wind-mill governor\r\nhas been substituted for the vane to get the direction of the wind, with\r\nadvantage. At the lower end of the tube, _T T_, is a small pinion, working\r\nin a rack, _r_, which moves backwards and forwards as the wind presses the\r\nvane. To this rack a pencil, _x_, is attached, which marks the direction\r\nof the wind on a properly ruled paper, placed horizontally beneath, and so\r\nadjusted as to progress at the rate of half an inch per hour, by means of\r\na simple contrivance connecting it with a good clock. The paper is shown\r\nin the illustration upon the table of the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe pressure plate, _F_, for ascertaining the force of the wind, is one\r\nfoot square, placed immediately beneath, and at right angles with the\r\nvane; it is supported by light bars, running horizontally on friction\r\nrollers, and communicating with flattened springs, 1, 2, 3, so that the\r\nplate, when affected by the pressure of the wind, acts upon them, and they\r\ntransfer such action to a copper chain passing down the interior of the\r\ndirection tube, and over a pulley at the bottom. A light copper wire\r\nconnects this chain with the spring lever, _y y_, carrying a pencil which\r\nrecords the pressure upon the paper below. Mr. Osler much prefers a spring\r\nto any other means for ascertaining the force of the wind, because it is\r\nof the highest importance to have as little matter in motion as possible,\r\notherwise the momentum acquired will cause the pressure plate to give very\r\nerroneous indications. The pressure plate is as light as is consistent\r\nwith strength. It is kept before the wind by the vane, and is urged out by\r\nthree or more springs, so that with light winds one only is compressed,\r\nand two, or more, according to the strength of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe _pluviometer_ is placed on the right in the figure, _P P_ being the\r\nplane of the roof of the building. The rain funnel, _R_, exposes an area\r\nof about 200 square inches. The water collected in it is conveyed by a\r\ntube through the roof of the building into a glass vessel, _G_, so\r\nadjusted and graduated as to indicate a quarter of an inch of rain for\r\nevery 200 square inches of surface, _i. e._ 50 cubic inches. _G_ is\r\nsupported by spiral springs, _b b_, which are compressed by the\r\naccumulating rain. A glass tube, open at both ends, is cemented into the\r\nbottom of _G_, and over it is placed a larger one closed at the top like a\r\nbell glass. The smaller tube thus forms the long leg of a syphon, and the\r\nlarger tube acts as the short leg. The water, having risen to the level of\r\nthe top of the inner tube, drops over into a little copper tilt, _t_, in\r\nthe globe, _S_, beneath the reservoir. This tilt is divided into two equal\r\npartitions by a slip of copper, and placed upon an axis not exactly\r\nbalanced, but so that one end or the other preponderates. The water then\r\ndrops into the end of the tilt which happens to be uppermost, and when\r\nquite full it falls over, throwing the water into the globe, _S_, from\r\nwhich it flows away by the waste pipe. In this way an imperfect vacuum is\r\nproduced in the globe, quite sufficient to produce a draught in the small\r\ntube of the syphon, or the long leg; and the whole contents of the\r\nreservoir, _G_, immediately run off, and the spiral springs, _b b_,\r\nelevate the reservoir to its original position. To produce this action, a\r\nquarter of an inch of rain must have fallen. The registration is easily\r\nunderstood. A spring lever, _z_, carrying a pencil, is attached by a\r\ncord, _c_, to _S_. This spring always keeps the cord tight, so that as the\r\napparatus descends during the fall of rain, the spring advances the pencil\r\nmore and more from the zero of the scale upon the paper beneath, until a\r\nquarter of an inch has fallen, when the pencil is drawn back to zero by\r\nthe ascent of the reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe clock movement carries the registering paper forward by one of the\r\nwheels working into a rack attached to the frame.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment of the instrument should be carefully made at its first\r\nerection. The scale for pressure should be established experimentally, by\r\napplying weights of 2, 4, 6, &c., lbs., to move the pressure plate.\r\n\r\nThe registration trace for twenty-four hours is readily understood. The\r\ndirection is recorded on the centre part; the pressure on one side, and\r\nthe rain on the other. Lines parallel to the length of the paper show no\r\nrain, steady wind, and constant pressure. On the rain trace, a line\r\nparallel to the width of the paper shows that the pencil had been drawn\r\nback to zero, a quarter of an inch of rain having fallen. The hour lines\r\nare in the direction of the width of the paper.\r\n\r\nAt the International Exhibition 1862, Messrs. Negretti and Zambra\r\nexhibited an improved Osler's anemometer, having combined with it\r\nRobinson's cups, so that the pressure and velocity appear on the same\r\nsheet, on which a line an inch in length is recorded at every ten miles;\r\nthus the complete instrument shows continuously the direction, pressure,\r\nand velocity of the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=128. Beckley's Anemometer.=--Mr. R. Beckley, of the Kew Observatory, has\r\ndevised a self-registering anemometer, which consists of three principal\r\nparts: Robinson's cups for the determination of velocity; a double fan, or\r\nwind-mill governor, for obtaining the direction; and a clock to move a\r\ncylinder, around which registration paper is wrapped. The paper records\r\nthe time, velocity, and direction of the wind for twenty-four hours, when\r\nit must be replaced. It has a cast-iron tubular support, or pedestal to\r\ncarry the external parts--the cups and the fans,--which must be erected\r\nupon the roof of the building upon which it is desired to mount the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThe fans keep their axis at right angles to the wind; and with any change\r\nof direction they move, carrying with them an outer brass tube, which\r\nrests upon friction balls on the top of the pedestal, and is attached to a\r\ntubular shaft passing through the interior of the pedestal, and\r\nterminating with a mitre wheel. The mitre wheel, working with other cogged\r\nwheels, communicates the motion of the direction shaft to a cylinder\r\ncarrying a pencil, to record the direction.\r\n\r\nThe shaft carrying the cups is supported upon friction balls, placed in a\r\ngroove formed on the top of the direction shaft, and passing through the\r\ninterior of that shaft, comes out below the mitre wheel, where it is\r\nterminated in an endless screw, or worm.\r\n\r\nUpon the wind moving the cups, motion is given to the innermost shaft,\r\nthence to the worm-wheel, whence motion is given to a pencil which\r\nregisters the velocity.\r\n\r\nDe la Rue's metallic paper is used in registration, it having the property\r\nof receiving a trace from a brass pencil. The pencils can, therefore, be\r\nmade in the most convenient form. Mr. Beckley forms each pencil of a strip\r\nof brass wrapped round a cylinder, making a very thin threaded screw, so\r\nthat the contact of the pencil cylinder and the clock cylinder is a mere\r\npoint of the metallic thread. The pencil cylinders are placed side by side\r\nupon the cylinder turned by the clock, and require no spring or other\r\nappliance to keep them to their work, but always make contact with the\r\nregistration paper by their own gravity. They therefore require no\r\nattention, and being as long as the trace which they make, they will last\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nThe velocity pencil has only one turn on the cylinder, and its pitch is\r\nequal to a scale of fifty miles upon the paper. The direction pencil has\r\nlikewise one turn on its cylinder, its pitch being equal to a scale of the\r\ncardinal points of the compass upon the paper.\r\n\r\nThe clock gives a uniform motion of half an inch per hour to the cylinder\r\nupon which the paper is fastened.\r\n\r\nThe registering mechanism of the instrument is very compact, requiring\r\nonly a space of about 18 inches by 8 inches.\r\n\r\nIn the Report of the British Association for 1858, Mr. Beckley has given a\r\ndetailed description of his anemometer, with drawings of all the parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=129. Self-Registering Lind's Anemometer.=--A Lind's wind-gauge, designed\r\nto register the maximum pressure, was exhibited at the International\r\nExhibition 1862, by Mr. E. G. Wood. The bend of the syphon is contracted\r\nto obtain steadiness. On the leeward limb a hole is drilled corresponding\r\nin size with the contracted portion of the tube. The edge of the hole\r\ncorresponds with the zero of the scale. On the pressure of the wind\r\nincreasing, as much of the water as would have risen above the aperture\r\nflows away, and therefore the quantity left indicates the greatest\r\npressure of the wind since the last setting of the instrument, which is\r\ndone by filling it with water up to the zero point.\r\n\r\n\r\n=130. Anemometric Observations.=--To illustrate the value of anemometric\r\nobservations, we quote from a paper by Mr. Hartnup, on the results\r\nobtained from Osler's Anemometer, at the Liverpool Observatory. The six\r\nyears' observations, ending 1857, gave for the yearly average of the\r\nwinds: North-easterly, on 60 days, at 7.8 miles per hour; North-westerly,\r\non 112 days, at 15.4 miles per hour; South-easterly, on 115 days, at 11.0\r\nmiles per hour; South-westerly, on 77 days, at 13.8 miles per hour; and\r\none day calm. From the same observations, the average variation in the\r\nstrength of the wind during the 24 hours is:--11 miles per hour, the\r\nminimum force, occurring at 1-1/2 a.m.; until 6 a.m. it remains much the\r\nsame, being then 11.3 miles per hour; at 10 a.m. it is 13.4 miles per\r\nhour; at 1-1/2 p.m. the wind is at its maximum strength, being 14.8 miles\r\nper hour; at 5 p.m. it is again 13.4 miles per hour, and at 9 p.m. 11.3\r\nmiles per hour. Hence it appears that the wind falls to its minimum force\r\nmuch more gradually than it rises to its maximum; that the decrease and\r\nincrease are equal and contrary, so that the curve is symmetrical; and\r\nthat generally the force of wind is less at night than during the day.\r\n\r\n\"There is evidence,\" says Admiral FitzRoy, \"in Mr. Hartnup's very valuable\r\nanemometrical results, which seems to prove that to his observatory, in a\r\nvalley, with buildings and hills to the north-eastward, the real polar\r\ncurrent does not blow from N.E., but nearer S.E. By his reliable digest of\r\nwinds experienced there, it appears that those most prevalent were from\r\nW.N.W. and S.S.E. But in England, generally, the _prevailing_ winds are\r\n_believed_ to be westerly, inclining to south-westerly, and\r\nnorth-easterly; while of all winds, the south-easterly is about the\r\nrarest.\r\n\r\n\"At Lord Wrottesley's observatory, in Staffordshire, about 530 feet above\r\nthe sea, there appears to be considerably less strength of wind at any\r\ngiven time, when a gale is blowing _generally_, than occurs simultaneously\r\nat places along the sea-coast: whence the inference is, that undulations\r\nof the land's surface and hills, diminish the strength of wind materially\r\nby frictional resistance.\r\n\r\n\"All the synoptic charts hitherto advanced at the Board of Trade exhibit a\r\nmarked diminution of force inland compared with that on the sea-coast.\r\nIndeed, the coast itself offers similar evidence, in its stunted, sloping\r\ntrees, and comparative barrenness.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS FOR INVESTIGATING ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=131. Atmospheric Electroscope.=--The simplest instrument for ascertaining\r\nat any time the electric condition of the atmosphere is an electroscope\r\ncomposed of two equal pieces of gold leaf, suspended from a brass support,\r\nand insulated, as well as protected from the movement of the air, by a\r\nglass covering. Fig. 90 represents such an instrument. The cap of the\r\nbrass support is fitted for the reception, in the vertical direction, of a\r\nmetallic rod, not less than two or three feet in length. The top of the\r\nrod carries a clip. The instrument acts according to the law, that bodies\r\nsimilarly electrified repel each other; but when dissimilarly electrified,\r\nthey attract each other. To make an observation, the instrument is placed\r\nin the open air, and a lighted piece of cigar fusee, or touch-paper, is\r\nfixed in the clip. The electricity of the air is collected by the\r\nsubstance undergoing combustion, and conducted by the rod to the gold\r\nleaf; and the pieces, being similarly electrified, separate more or less\r\naccording to the amount of electricity present. The kind is determined by\r\nthe effect of either an excited stick of sealing-wax or rod of glass upon\r\nthe electrified gold leaf. A rod of glass, when rubbed briskly with a silk\r\nhandkerchief or piece of woollen cloth, becomes positively electrified, or\r\nexcited, as it is termed. A stick of sealing-wax, similarly treated,\r\nacquires the negative state. If, therefore, an excited glass rod be\r\npresented to the cap of the instrument, and it cause the pieces of gold\r\nleaf to diverge still further, the electric state of the air must be\r\nanalogous to that of the glass, that is, _positive_; if they approach, it\r\nis _negative_. On the contrary, if a stick of sealing-wax be used, the\r\npieces will be repelled more apart if they have acquired negative\r\nelectricity from the air; and they will converge if they have a positive\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.]\r\n\r\nBy means of this very simple instrument, meteorological observers can\r\nreadily ascertain the electric condition of the lower air at any time.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--A book containing strips of gold leaf is sent with the Electrometer\r\nto replace the gold leaves when torn or broken in use.\r\n\r\nTo mount fresh gold leaves, unscrew the brass plate to which is attached\r\nthe rod supporting the leaves; then moisten with the breath the flat piece\r\nof brass, and press it gently down on one strip of gold, whilst the book\r\nis only partly opened; the second leaf is attached in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=132. Volta's Electrometer= is similar to the instrument just described,\r\nexcept that instead of gold leaf two light pieces of straw, or two pith\r\nballs, are freely suspended from the conductor; the amount of the electric\r\ncharge being estimated from the degrees of divergence, shown by a\r\ngraduated arc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=133. Peltier's Electrometer= is a much superior instrument in point of\r\nsensibility. A tall glass tube an inch or more in diameter, is connected\r\nto a glass receiver, mounted on a base fitted with levelling screws. At\r\nthe top of the tube is formed a globe from four to five inches in\r\ndiameter, which is thickly gilt on the exterior, so as to form a good\r\nconducting surface. A wire passes from the ball down the tube into the\r\nreceiver, where it is bent up, and ends in a steel point over the centre\r\nof the base. A bent wire, carrying a small magnetic needle, is balanced on\r\nthe steel point, so that the magnet, with the fine wire, arranges itself\r\nhorizontally in the direction of the magnetic meridian. If any cloud or\r\nportion of air in the neighbourhood be in an electrical state, it will act\r\nby induction upon the gilt ball, and the needle will be deflected from its\r\nnorth and south direction.\r\n\r\nA graduated circle indicates the number of degrees of the deflection,\r\nwhich will be greater or less according to the tension of the electricity.\r\nTo ascertain whether the electricity is positive or negative, a stick of\r\nshellac or glass must be employed, as already described.\r\n\r\n\r\n=134. Bohnenberger's Electroscope= may be fitted with a metallic\r\nconductor, and used with great advantage for observing atmospheric\r\nelectricity. \"The principal parts of the instrument, as improved by\r\nBecquerel, are the following:--_A B_, fig. 91, is a small dry galvanic\r\npile of from 500 to 800 pairs, about a quarter of an inch in diameter;\r\nwhen the plates are pressed together, such a pile will be from 2 to 2-1/2\r\ninches in length. The wires, which are bent so as to stand above the pile,\r\nterminate in two plates, _P_ and _M_, which are the poles of the pile.\r\nThese plates, which are 2 inches by 1/2 an inch, are parallel and opposite\r\nto each other. It is convenient for their opposite sides to be slightly\r\nconvex, for them to be gilded or coated with platinum, and for them to run\r\non the polar wires, by the latter being made to pass through a small hole\r\nin them. One of these plates will always be in a state of positive, and\r\nthe other of negative, electricity; between them suspend the very fine\r\ngold leaf, _D G_, which is attached to the conductor, _C D_, of copper\r\nwire. If the leaf hang exactly between the two plates, it is equally\r\nattracted by each, and will therefore be in a state of repose. The\r\napparatus should be protected by a bell-glass, fitting exactly, and having\r\nan opening at the top through which the copper wire, _C D_, passes; the\r\nwire, however, is insulated by its being contained in a glass tube, which\r\nis made to adhere to the bell-glass by means of a small portion of shellac\r\nor gum-lac. Screw on a metal ball or plate, to impart to it the\r\nelectricity you wish to test, which will be conveyed by the copper wire to\r\nthe gold leaf, and the latter will immediately move towards the plate\r\nwhich has the opposite polarity. This electroscope is, beyond doubt, one\r\nof the most delicate ever constructed, and is well adapted to show small\r\nquantities of positive and negative electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\n\"To ensure the susceptibility of electroscopes and electrometers placed\r\nunder bell-glasses, precautions should be taken to render the air they\r\ncontain as dry as possible, which may be effected by enclosing in a\r\nsuitable vessel a little melted chloride of calcium beneath the glass.\"\r\n\r\nThe galvanic pile employed in this electroscope is that invented by\r\nZamboni. \"It differs from the common hydro-electric batteries principally\r\nin this, that the presence of the electromotive liquid is dispensed with,\r\nand that in its place is substituted some moist substance of low\r\nconducting power, generally paper. The electromotors in these piles are\r\ncomposed for the most part of Dutch gold (copper) and silver (zinc) paper\r\npressed one on the other, with their paper sides together, out of which\r\ndiscs are cut with a diameter of from a quarter of an inch to an inch.\r\nMore powerful pairs of plates may be obtained by using only the silver\r\npaper and smearing its paper side with a thin coat of honey, on which some\r\nfinely pulverized peroxide of manganese has been sprinkled, and all the\r\nsides similarly coated are presented one way. Powerful pairs of plates may\r\nalso be made by pasting pure gold leaf on the paper side of zinc-paper.\r\nThese plates are then to be arranged, just as in the ordinary voltaic\r\npile, one above the other, so that the similar metallic surfaces may all\r\nlie one way; press them tightly together; tie them with pretty stout silk\r\nthreads, and press them into a glass tube of convenient size. The metal\r\nrims of the tubes, which must be well connected with the outermost pairs\r\nof plates, form the poles of the pile, the negative pole being in the\r\nextreme zinc surface, and the positive in the extreme copper or manganese\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\"The electromotive energy called into action in these dry piles is less\r\nthan that excited in the moist or hydro-electric piles, principally on\r\naccount of the imperfect conduction of the paper. The accumulation of\r\nelectricity at their poles also goes on less rapidly, and consequently the\r\nelectrical tension continues for a long while unaltered; whereas, in all\r\nmoist piles, even in the most constant of them, the tension is maintained,\r\ncomparatively speaking, for but a short time, on account of the chemical\r\naction and decomposition of the electromotive fluid--causes of disturbance\r\nwhich do not exist in the dry pile.\"[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n=135. Thomson's Electrometer.=--Professor W. Thomson, of Glasgow, has\r\ndevised an atmospheric electrometer, which is likely to become eminently\r\nsuccessful, in the hands of skilful observers. It is mainly a torsion\r\nbalance combined with a Leyden-jar. The index is an aluminium needle\r\nstrung on a fine platinum wire, passing through its centre of gravity, and\r\nstretched firmly between two points. The needle and wire are carefully\r\ninsulated from the greater part of the instrument, but are in metallic\r\ncommunication with two small plates fixed beside the two ends of the\r\nneedle, and termed the repelling plates. A second pair of larger plates\r\nface the repelling plates, on the opposite side of the needle, but\r\nconsiderably farther from it. These plates are in connection with the\r\ninner coating of a Leyden-jar, and are termed the attracting plates. The\r\nwhole instrument is enclosed in a metal cage, to protect the glass\r\nLeyden-jar and the delicate needle.\r\n\r\nThe Leyden-jar should be charged when the instrument is used. Its effect\r\nis two-fold: it increases greatly the sensibility of the instrument, and\r\nenables the observer to distinguish between positive and negative\r\nelectrification.\r\n\r\nThe air inside the jar is kept dry by pumice-stone, slightly moistened\r\nwith sulphuric acid; by which means very perfect insulation is maintained.\r\n\r\nElectrodes, or terminals, are brought outside the instrument, by which the\r\nLeyden-jar can be charged, and the needle system connected with the body,\r\nthe electric state of which is to be tested.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of testing the electric state of the atmosphere, the\r\ninstrument is provided with a conductor and support for a burning match,\r\nor, preferably, with an arrangement termed a water-dropping collector; by\r\neither of which means the electricity of the air is conveyed to the needle\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe needle abuts upon the repelling plates when not influenced by\r\nelectricity, in which position it is at zero. It can always be brought\r\nback to zero by a torsion-head, turning one end of the platinum wire, but\r\ninsulated from it, and provided with a graduated circle, so that the\r\nmagnitude of the arc, that the torsion-head is moved through to bring the\r\nneedle to zero, measures the force tending to deflect it.\r\n\r\nThe action of the instrument is as follows:--The Leyden-jar is to be\r\nhighly charged, say negatively; and the repelling plates are to be\r\nconnected with the earth. The needle will then be deflected against a\r\nstop, under the combined influence of attraction from the Leyden-jar, or\r\nattracting plates, and repulsion from the repelling plates due to the\r\npositive charge induced on the needle and its plates by the Leyden-jar\r\nplates. The platinum wire must then be turned round by the torsion-head so\r\nas to bring back the needle to zero; and the number of degrees of torsion\r\nrequired will measure the force with which the needle is attracted. Next,\r\nlet the needle plates be disconnected from the earth, and connected with\r\nthe insulated body, the electric state of which is to be tested. In\r\ntesting the atmosphere, the conductor and lighted match, or water-dropping\r\napparatus, must be applied.\r\n\r\nIf the electricity of the body be positive, it will augment the positive\r\ncharge in the needle plates, induced by the Leyden-jar plates; and\r\nconsequently the needle will be more deflected than by the action of the\r\njar alone. If the electricity of the body be negative, it will tend to\r\nneutralize the positive charge; and the needle will be less deflected.\r\nHence the kind of electricity present in the air becomes at once apparent,\r\nwithout the necessity of an experimental test. The platinum wire must then\r\nbe turned till the needle is brought to zero, and the number of degrees\r\nobserved; which is a measure of the intensity of the electrification.\r\n\r\nAny loss of charge from the Leyden-jar which may from time to time occur,\r\nreducing the sensibility inconveniently, may be made good by additions\r\nfrom a small electrophorus which accompanies the instrument.[16]\r\n\r\nThe instrument may be made self-recording by the aid of clockwork and\r\nphotography. To effect this, a clock gives motion to a cylinder, upon\r\nwhich photographic paper is mounted. The needle of the electrometer is\r\nmade to carry a small reflector; and rays from a properly adjusted source\r\nof light are thrown by the reflector, through a small opening, upon the\r\nphotographic paper. It is evident, that as the cylinder revolves, a trace\r\nwill be left upon the paper, showing the magnitude of, and variations in,\r\nthe deflection of the needle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=136. Fundamental Facts regarding Atmospheric Electricity.=--The _general_\r\nelectrical condition of the atmosphere is _positive_ in relation to the\r\nsurface of the earth and ocean, becoming more and more positive as the\r\naltitude increases. When the sky is overcast, and the clouds are moving in\r\ndifferent directions, it is subject to great and sudden variations,\r\nchanging rapidly from positive to negative, and the reverse. During fog,\r\nrain, hail, sleet, snow, and thunderstorms, the electrical state of the\r\nair undergoes many variations. The intensity of the electricity increases\r\nwith hot weather following a series of wet days, or of wet weather coming\r\nafter a continuance of dry days. The atmospheric electricity, in fact,\r\nseems to depend for its intensity and kind upon the direction and\r\ncharacter of the prevailing wind, under ordinary circumstances. It has an\r\nannual and a diurnal variation. There is a greater diurnal change of\r\ntension in winter than in summer. By comparing observations from month to\r\nmonth, a gradual increase of tension is perceived from July to February,\r\nand a decrease from February to July. The intensity seems to vary with the\r\ntemperature. The diurnal variation exhibits two periods of greatest and\r\ntwo of least intensity. In summer, the _maxima_ occur about 10 a.m. and 10\r\np.m.; the _minima_ about 2 a.m. and noon. In winter, the _maxima_ take\r\nplace near 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.; the _minima_ near 4 a.m. and 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Saussure, Beccaria, Crosse, Quetelet, Thompson, and\r\nFitzRoy have tended to show that during the prevalence of polar currents\r\nof air positive electricity is developed, and becomes more or less active\r\naccording to the greater or less coldness and strength of wind; but with\r\nwinds from the equatorial direction there is little evidence of sensitive\r\nelectricity, and when observable, it is of the negative kind. Storms and\r\ngales of wind are generally attended, in places, with lightning and\r\nthunder; and as the former are very often attributed to the conflict of\r\npolar and equatorial winds, the difference of the electric tension of\r\nthese winds may account for the latter phenomena. It is not our intention\r\nto enter upon the general consideration of thunderstorms; the facts which\r\nwe have given may be of service to the young observer; and finally, as it\r\nis interesting to be able to judge of the locality of a thunderstorm, the\r\nfollowing simple rule will be of service, and sufficiently accurate:--Note\r\nby a second's watch the number of seconds which elapse from the sight of\r\nthe lightning to the commencement of the thunder; divide them by five, and\r\nthe quotient will be the distance in miles. Thus, if thunder is heard ten\r\nseconds after the lightning was seen, the distance from the seat of the\r\nstorm will be about two miles. The interval between the flash and the roll\r\nhas seldom been observed greater than seventy-two seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=137. Lightning Conductors.=--\"The line of danger, whether from the\r\nburning or lifting power of lightning, is the line of strong and\r\nobstructed currents of air, of the greatest aerial friction.\"[17] Trees,\r\nchurch spires, wind-mills and other tall structures, obstruct the aerial\r\ncurrents, and hence their exposure to danger. The highest objects of the\r\nlandscape, especially those that are nearest the thunder cloud, will\r\nreceive the lightning stroke. The more elevated the object, the more\r\nlikely is it to be struck. Of two or more objects, equally tall and near,\r\nthe lightning is invariably found to select the best conductor of\r\nelectricity, and even to make a circuitous path to get to it. Hence the\r\napplication and evident advantage of metallic rods, called _lightning\r\nconductors_, attached to buildings and ships. A lightning conductor should\r\nbe pointed at top, and extend some feet above the highest part of the\r\nedifice, or mast. It should be made of copper, which is a better\r\nconducting medium than iron, and more durable, being less corrosive. It\r\nmust be unbroken throughout its length, and extend to the bottom of the\r\nbuilding, and even some distance into the ground, so as to conduct the\r\nelectricity into a well or moist soil. If it be connected with the lead\r\nand iron work in the structure of the house, it will be all the better, as\r\naffording a larger surface, and a readier means of exit for the fluid. In\r\na ship, the lower end of the conductor should be led into communication\r\nwith the hull, if of iron, and with the copper sheathing, if a wooden\r\nvessel; so that, spread over a large surface, it may escape more readily\r\nto the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=138. Precautions against Lightning.=--Experience seems to warrant the\r\nassumption that any building or ship, fitted with a substantial lightning\r\nconductor, is safe from danger during a thunderstorm. Should a house or\r\nvessel be undefended by a conductor, it may be advisable to adopt a few\r\nprecautions against danger. In a house, the fire-place should be avoided,\r\nbecause the lightning may enter by the chimney, its sooty lining being a\r\ngood conductor. \"Through chimneys, lightning has a way into most houses;\r\nand therefore, it is wise, by opening doors or windows, to give it a way\r\nout. Wherever the aerial current is fiercest, there the danger is\r\ngreatest; and if we kept out of the way of currents or draughts, we keep\r\nout of the way of the lightning.\"[18] Lightning evinces as it were a\r\npreference for metallic substances, and will fly from place to place, even\r\nout of the direct line of its passage to the earth, to enter such bodies.\r\nIt is therefore well to avoid, as much as possible, gildings, silvered\r\nmirrors, and articles of metal. The best place is perhaps the middle of\r\nthe room, unless a draught passes, or a metallic lamp or chandelier should\r\nbe hanging from the ceiling. The neighbourhood of bad conductors, such as\r\nglass windows, not being open, and on a thick bed of mattrasses, are safe\r\nplaces. The quality of trees as lightning conductors is considered to\r\ndepend upon their height and moisture, those which are taller and\r\nrelatively more humid being struck in preference to their fellows;\r\ntherefore, it is unwise to seek shelter under tall and wet trees during a\r\nthunderstorm. In the absence of any other shelter, it would be better to\r\nlie down on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOZONE AND ITS INDICATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=139. Nature of Ozone.=--During the action of a powerful electric machine,\r\nand in the decomposition of water by the voltaic battery, a peculiar odour\r\nis perceptible, which is considered to arise from the generation of a\r\nsubstance to which the term ozone has been given, on account of its having\r\nbeen first detected by smell, which, for a long time after its discovery,\r\nwas its only known characteristic. A similar odour is evolved by the\r\ninfluence of phosphorus on moist air, and in other cases of slow\r\ncombustion. It is also traceable, by the smell, in air,--where a flash of\r\nlightning has passed immediately before. Afterwards it was established\r\nthat the same element possessed an oxidising property. It was found to be\r\nliberated at the oxygen electrode when water was decomposed by an electric\r\ncurrent; and has been regarded by some chemists as what is termed an\r\n_allotropic_ form of oxygen, while others speak of it as oxygen in the\r\n_nascent_ state, and some even regard it as intimately related to\r\nchlorine. So various are the existing notions of the nature of this\r\nobscure agent.\r\n\r\nIts oxidising property affords a ready means for its detection, even when\r\nthe sense of smell completely fails. The methods of noting the presence\r\nand measuring the amount of ozone present in the air, are very simple;\r\nbeing the free exposure to the air, defended from rain and the direct rays\r\nof the sun, of prepared test-papers. There are two kinds of test-papers.\r\nOne kind was invented by Dr. Schonbein, the original discoverer of ozone;\r\nand the other, which is more generally approved, by Dr. Moffat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=140. Schonbein's Ozonometer= consists of strips of paper, previously\r\nsaturated with a solution of starch and iodide of potassium, and dried.\r\nThe papers are suspended in a box, or otherwise properly exposed to the\r\nair, for a given interval, as twenty-four hours. The presence of ozone is\r\nshown by the test-paper acquiring a purple tint when momentarily immersed\r\nin water. The amount is estimated by the depth of the tint, according to a\r\nscale of ten tints furnished for the purpose, which are distinguished by\r\nnumbers from 1 to 10. The ozone decomposes the compound which iodine forms\r\nwith hydrogen, and, it is presumed, combines as oxygen with hydrogen,\r\nwhile the iodine unites with the starch, giving the blue colour when\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\n\r\n=141. Dr. Moffat's Ozonometer= consists of papers prepared in a somewhat\r\nsimilar manner to Schonbein's; but they do not require immersion in water.\r\nThe presence of ozone is shown by a brown tint, and the amount by the\r\ndepth of tint according to a scale of ten tints, which is furnished with\r\neach box of the papers.\r\n\r\nMoffat's have the advantage of preserving their tint for years, if kept in\r\nthe dark, or between the leaves of a book; and are simpler to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.]\r\n\r\n=142. Sir James Clark's Ozone Cage= (fig. 92), consists of two cylinders\r\nof very fine wire gauze, one fitting into the other; the wire gauze being\r\nof such a fineness as to permit the free ingress of air, at the same time\r\nthat it shuts out all light that would act injuriously on the test-paper,\r\nwhich is suspended by a clip or hook attached to the upper part of the\r\ninner cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n=143. Distribution and Effects of Ozone.=--Mr. Glaisher has found that\r\n\"the amount of ozone at stations of low elevation is small; at stations of\r\nhigh elevation, it is almost always present; and at other and intermediate\r\nstations, it is generally so. The presence and amount of ozone would seem\r\nto be graduated by the elevation, and to increase from the lowest to the\r\nhighest ground. The amount of ozone is less in towns than in the open\r\ncountry at the same elevation; and less at inland than at sea-side\r\nstations.\" It seems to abound most with winds from the sea, and to be most\r\nprevalent where the air is considered the purest and most salubrious. This\r\nmay seem, says Admiral FitzRoy, in _The Weather Book_, to point to a\r\nconnection between ozone and chlorine gas, which is in and over sea-water,\r\nand which _must_ be brought by any wind that blows from the sea. It\r\nprevails more over the ocean and near it than over land, especially land\r\nremote from the sea; and, says the Admiral, it affects the gastric juice,\r\nimproves digestion, and has a tanning effect. Dr. Daubeny, in his\r\n_Lectures on Climate_, writes: \"Its presence must have a sensible\r\ninfluence upon the purity of the air, by removing from it foetid and\r\ninjurious organic effluvia. It is also quite possible that ozone may play\r\nan important part in regulating the functions of the vegetable kingdom\r\nlikewise; and although it would be premature at present to speculate upon\r\nits specific office, yet, for this reason alone, it may be well to note\r\nthe fact of its frequency, in conjunction with the different phases which\r\nvegetation assumes, persuaded that no principle can be generally diffused\r\nthroughout nature, as appears to be the case, with this, without having\r\nsome important and appropriate use assigned for it to fulfil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=144. Registering Ozonometer.=--Dr. E. Lancaster has contrived an\r\nozonometer, the object of which is to secure the constant registration of\r\nozone, so that the varying quantities present in the atmosphere may be\r\ndetected and registered. For this purpose, an inch of ozone paper passes\r\nin each hour, by clock-work, beneath an opening in the cover of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS NOT DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=145. Chemical Weather Glass.=--This curious instrument appears to have\r\nbeen invented more than a hundred years ago, but the original maker is not\r\nknown. It is simply a glass vial about ten inches long and three quarters\r\nof an inch in diameter, which is nearly filled, and hermetically sealed,\r\nwith the following mixture:--Two drachms of camphor, half a drachm of\r\nnitrate of potassium, half a drachm of chlorate of ammonium, dissolved in\r\nabout two fluid ounces of absolute alcohol mixed with two ounces of\r\ndistilled water. All the ingredients should be as pure as possible, and\r\neach vial filled separately. When the instruments are made in numbers and\r\nfilled from a common mixture, some get more than the due proportion of the\r\nsolid ingredients, and consequently such glasses do not exhibit that\r\nuniformity of appearance and changes, that undoubtedly should accompany\r\nsimilar influencing circumstances. It is in consequence of a want of\r\nprecision and fixed principle of manufacture, that these interesting\r\ninstruments are not properly appreciated, and more generally used.\r\n\r\nThe glass should be kept quite undisturbed, exposed to the north, and\r\nshaded from the sun. Camphor is soluble in alcohol, but not in water,\r\nwhile both water and alcohol have different solvent powers, according to\r\nthe temperature; hence, the solid ingredients being in excess for certain\r\nconditions of solution, depending upon temperature chiefly, and perhaps\r\nelectricity and the action of light also, appear as crystals and disappear\r\nwith the various changes that occur in the weather.\r\n\r\nThe various appearances thus presented in the menstruum have been inferred\r\nto prognosticate atmospheric changes. The following rules have been\r\ndeduced from careful study of the glass and weather:--\r\n\r\n1. During cold weather, beautiful fern-like or feathery crystallization is\r\ndeveloped at the top, and sometimes even throughout the liquid. This is\r\nthe normal state of the glass during winter. The crystallization increases\r\nwith the coldness; and if the structure grows downward, the cold will\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n2. During warm and serene weather, the crystals dissolve, the upper and\r\ngreater part of the liquid becoming perfectly clear. This is the normal\r\nstate of the glass during summer. The less amount of crystallization, that\r\nis, the greater the clear portion of the liquid (for there is always some\r\nof the composition visible at the bottom), the greater the probability of\r\ncontinued fine dry weather.\r\n\r\n3. When the upper portion is clear, and flakes of the composition rise to\r\nthe top and aggregate, it is a sign of increasing wind and stormy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n4. In cold weather, if the top of the liquid becomes thick and cloudy, it\r\ndenotes approaching rain.\r\n\r\n5. In warm weather, if small crystals rise in the liquid, which still\r\nmaintains its clearness, rain may be expected.\r\n\r\n6. Sharpness in the points and features of the fern-like structure of the\r\ncrystals, is a sign of fine weather; but when they begin to break up, and\r\nare badly defined, unsettled weather may be expected.\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy, in _The Weather Book_, writes of this instrument as\r\nfollows:--\"Since 1825, we have generally had some of these glasses, as\r\ncuriosities rather than otherwise; for nothing certain could be made of\r\ntheir variations until lately, when it was fairly demonstrated that if\r\nfixed undisturbed in free air, not exposed to radiation, fire, or sun, but\r\nin the ordinary light of a well-ventilated room, or, _preferably_, in the\r\nouter air, the chemical mixture in a so-called storm-glass varies in\r\ncharacter with the _direction_ of the wind--not its force, _specially_\r\n(though it _may_ so vary in _appearance_, only from another cause,\r\n_electrical tension_).\r\n\r\n\"As the atmospheric current veers toward, comes from, or is only\r\n_approaching_ from the polar direction, this chemical mixture--if closely,\r\neven microscopically watched--is found to grow like _fir_, _yew_, fern\r\nleaves, or hoar-frost--or like crystallizations.\r\n\r\n\"As the wind, or great body of air, tends more from the _opposite_\r\nquarter, the lines or spikes--all regular, hard, or crisp\r\nfeatures--gradually diminish, till they vanish.\r\n\r\n\"Before, and in a continued southerly wind, the mixture sinks slowly\r\ndownward in the vial, till it becomes shapeless, like melting white sugar.\r\n\r\n\"Before, or during the continuance of a northerly wind (polar current),\r\nthe crystallizations are beautiful (if the mixture is correct, the glass a\r\n_fixture_, and duly _placed_); but the least motion of the liquid disturbs\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"When the main currents meet, and turn _toward the west_, making\r\n_easterly_ winds, stars are more or less numerous, and the liquid dull, or\r\nless clear. When, and while they _combine by the west_, making westerly\r\nwinds, the liquid is clear, and the crystallization well-defined, without\r\nloose stars.\r\n\r\n\"While _any hard_ or _crisp_ features are visible below, above, or at the\r\ntop of the liquid (where they form for polar winds), there is _plus_\r\nelectricity in the air; a _mixture_ of polar current co-existing _in that\r\nlocality_ with the opposite, or southerly.\r\n\r\n\"When nothing but soft, melting, sugary substance is seen, the atmospheric\r\ncurrent (feeble or strong as it may be) is southerly with _minus_\r\nelectricity, unmixed with, and _uninfluenced_ by, the contrary wind.\r\n\r\n\"Repeated trials with a delicate galvanometer, applied to measure electric\r\ntension in the air, have proved these facts, which are now found useful\r\nfor aiding, with the barometer and thermometer, in forecasting weather.\r\n\r\n\"Temperature affects the mixture much, but not solely; as many comparisons\r\nof winter with summer changes of temperature have fully proved.\r\n\r\n\"A confused appearance of the mixture, with flaky spots, or stars, in\r\nmotion, and less clearness of the liquid, indicates south-easterly wind,\r\nprobably strong to a gale.\r\n\r\n\"Clearness of the liquid, with more or less perfect crystallizations,\r\naccompanies a combination, or a contest, of the main currents, by the\r\n_west_, and very remarkable these differences are,--the results of these\r\nair currents acting on each other _from_ eastward, or from an entirely\r\nopposite direction, the _west_.\r\n\r\n\"The glass should be wiped clean now and then,--and once or twice a year\r\nthe mixture should be disturbed, by inverting and gently shaking the glass\r\nvial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.]\r\n\r\n=146. Leslie's Differential Thermometer.=--A glass tube having a large\r\nbulb at each extremity, and bent twice at right angles, as represented in\r\nfigure 93, containing strong sulphuric acid tinged with carmine, and\r\nsupported at the centre by a wooden stand, constitutes the differential\r\nthermometer as invented by Professor Leslie. The instrument is designed to\r\nexhibit and measure small differences of temperature. Each leg of the\r\ninstrument is usually from three to six inches long, and the balls are\r\nabout four inches apart. The calibre of the legs is about 1/50 inch, not\r\nmore; the other part of the tube may be wider. The tube is filled with the\r\nliquid, the bulbs contain air. When both bulbs are heated alike, each\r\nscale indicates zero. The scale is divided so that the space between the\r\nfreezing and the boiling-points of water is equal to 1,000 parts. When one\r\nbulb is heated more than the other, the difference of temperature is\r\ndelicately shown by the descent of the coloured fluid from the heated\r\nball. It is uninfluenced by changes in the temperature of the atmosphere;\r\nhence it is admirably adapted for experiments of radiant heat. The theory\r\nof the instrument is that gases expand equally for uniform increments of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=147. Rumford's Differential Thermometer= differs from that just described\r\nin simply containing only a small bubble of liquid, which lies in the\r\ncentre of the tube, when both bulbs are similarly influenced. The bulbs\r\nand other parts of the tube contain air. When one bulb is more heated than\r\nthe other, the bubble moves towards the one less heated; and the scale\r\nattached to the horizontal part of the tube affords a measurement of the\r\ndifference of temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.]\r\n\r\n=148. Glaisher's Thermometer Stand.=--The thermometer stand consists of a\r\nhorizontal board as a base, of a vertical board projecting upwards from\r\none edge of the horizontal one, and of two parallel inclined boards,\r\nseparated from each other by blocks of three inches in thickness,\r\nconnected at the top with the vertical, and at the bottom with the\r\nhorizontal board, and the air passes freely about and between them all. To\r\nthe top of the inclined boards is connected a small projecting roof to\r\nprevent the rain falling on the bulbs of the instrument, which are carried\r\non the face of the vertical board, with their bulbs projecting below it,\r\nso that the air plays freely on the bulbs from all sides. The whole frame\r\nrevolves on an upright post firmly fixed to the ground, as shown in the\r\nengraving, fig. 94; and in use, the inclined side is always turned towards\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n=149. Thermometer Screen, for use at Sea.=--This screen, or shade, was\r\ndesigned by Admiral FitzRoy, and has been in use for several years on\r\nboard H.M. vessels and many merchant-ships. It is about twenty-four inches\r\nlong by twelve wide and eight deep; having lattice-work sides, door, and\r\nbottom; with perforation also at top, so contrived that the air has free\r\naccess to the interior, while the direct rays of the sun, rain, and sea\r\nspray are effectually excluded from the thermometers mounted inside. There\r\nis ample space for two thermometers placed side by side on brackets, at\r\nleast three inches from each other or any part of the exterior of the\r\nscreen. One thermometer should be fitted up as a \"wet bulb\" (see p. 105).\r\nA small vessel of water can easily be fixed inside the screen so as to\r\nretain its position and contents under the usual motions of the ship; and\r\nby means of a piece of cotton-wick, or muslin rag tied round the bulb of\r\nthe thermometer and trailing into the cup of water, keep the bulb\r\nconstantly moist.\r\n\r\nSelf-registering thermometers should be protected by a similar screen. It\r\nhas been found that thermometric observations made at sea are not valuable\r\nfor scientific purposes unless the instruments have been duly protected by\r\nsuch a screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n=150. Anemoscope=, or Portable Wind Vane for travellers, with compass, bar\r\nneedle, &c., shows the direct course of the wind to half a point of the\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.]\r\n\r\n=151. Evaporating Dish, or Gauge= (fig. 95), for showing the amount of\r\nevaporation from the earth's surface. This gauge consists of a brass\r\nvessel, the area or evaporating surface of which is accurately determined;\r\nand also a glass cylindrical measure, graduated into inches, tenths, and\r\nhundredths of inches. In use, the evaporating gauge is nearly filled with\r\nwater, the quantity having been previously measured by means of the glass\r\ncylinder; it is then placed out of doors, freely exposed to the action of\r\nthe atmosphere; after exposure, the water is again measured, and the\r\ndifference between the first and second measurement shows the amount of\r\nevaporation that has taken place. If rain has fallen during the exposure\r\nof the gauge, the quantity collected by it must be deducted from the\r\nmeasured quantity; the amount is shown by the quantity of rain collected\r\nin the rain gauge. The wire cage round the gauge is to prevent animals,\r\nbirds, &c., from drinking the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=152. Dr. Babington's Atmidometer=, or instrument for measuring the\r\nevaporation from water, _ice or snow_, consists of an oblong hollow bulb\r\nof glass or copper, beneath which and communicating with it by a\r\ncontracted neck is a second globular bulb, duly weighted with mercury or\r\nshot. The upper bulb is surmounted by a small glass or metal stem, having\r\na scale graduated to grains and half-grains; on the top of which is fixed\r\nhorizontally a shallow metal pan. The bulbs are immersed in a vessel of\r\nwater having a circular hole in the cover through which the stem rises.\r\nDistilled water is then gradually poured into the pan above, until the\r\nzero of the stem sinks to a level with the cover of the vessel. Thus\r\nadjusted, as the water in the pan evaporates, the stem ascends, and the\r\namount of evaporation is indicated in grains. This instrument affords a\r\nmeans of measuring evaporation from _ice or snow_. An adjustment for\r\ntemperature is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n=153. Cloud Reflector.=--At the International Exhibition 1862, Mr. J. T.\r\nGoddard exhibited a cloud mirror, for ascertaining the direction in which\r\nthe clouds are moving.\r\n\r\nThe mirror is laid on a horizontal support near a window, and fastened so\r\nthat the point marked north may coincide with the south point of the\r\nhorizon,--the several points will consequently be reversed. The edge of a\r\nconspicuous cloud is brought to the centre of the mirror, and the observer\r\nkeeps perfectly still until it passes off at the margin, where the true\r\npoint of the horizon _from which_ the clouds are coming can be read off.\r\n\r\n\r\n=154. Sunshine Recorder.=--Mr. Goddard also exhibited an instrument which\r\nhe calls by this name. It works by letting the sun's rays pass through a\r\nnarrow slit, and fall on photographic paper wound round a barrel moved by\r\nclock-work; the paper being changed daily, and the photographic impression\r\ndeveloped and fixed in the usual manner.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n155. SET OF PORTABLE INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn a small box, 8 in. by 8 in. by 4 in., a complete set of meteorological\r\ninstruments have been packed. The lid of the box, by an ingenious\r\narrangement, is made to take off and hang up; on it are permanently fixed\r\nfor observation, a maximum and minimum, and a pair of dry and wet bulb\r\nthermometers. The interior of the box contains a maximum thermometer in\r\nvacuo for solar radiation, and a minimum for terrestrial purposes, one of\r\nNegretti and Zambra's small pocket aneroid barometers, pedometer for\r\nmeasuring distances, pocket compass, clinometer, and lastly a rain gauge.\r\nThis latter instrument consists of an accurately turned brass ring having\r\nan india rubber body fastened to it to receive the rain, which is measured\r\noff by a small graduated glass, also contained in the box. Gentlemen\r\ntravelling will find this compact observatory all that can be desired for\r\nmeteorological observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n156. IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe practical meteorologist will find the following articles very useful,\r\nif not necessary. They scarcely require description; an enumeration will\r\ntherefore suffice:--_Weather Diagrams_, or prepared printed and ruled\r\nforms, whereon to exhibit graphically the readings of the various\r\ninstruments to render their indications useful in foretelling weather,\r\n&c.;--_Meteorological Registers_, or Record Books, for recording all\r\nobservations, and the deductions;--_Cloud Pictures_, by which the clouds\r\ncan be readily referred to their particular classification, very necessary\r\nto the inexperienced and learners;--Cyclone Glasses, or Horns, outline\r\nMaps with Wind-markers, are also useful, especially in forecasting\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n\r\n157. HYDROMETER.\r\n\r\nA simple kind of hydrometer is very much used at sea, as \"a sea-water\r\ntest;\" and as the observations are usually recorded in a meteorological\r\nregister or the ship's log-book, it may not be altogether out of place to\r\ngive a description of it here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.]\r\n\r\nIt is constructed of glass. If made of brass, the corrosive action of\r\nsalt-water soon renders the instrument erroneous in its indications. The\r\nshapes usually given to the instruments are shown in figs. 96 and 97. A\r\nglobular bulb is blown, and partly filled with mercury or small shot, to\r\nmake the instrument float steadily in a vertical position. From the neck\r\nof the bulb the glass is expanded into an oval or a cylindrical shape, to\r\ngive the instrument sufficient volume for flotation; finally, it is\r\ntapered off to a narrow upright stem which encloses an ivory scale, and is\r\nclosed at the top. The divisions on the scale read downward, so as to\r\nmeasure the length of the stem which stands above the surface of any\r\nliquid in which the hydrometer is floated. The denser the fluid, the\r\nhigher will the instrument rise; the rarer, the lower it will sink.\r\n\r\nThe indications depend upon the hydrostatic principle, that floating\r\nbodies displace a quantity of the fluid which sustains them equal to their\r\nown weight. According, therefore, as the specific gravities of fluids\r\ndiffer from each other, so will vary the quantities of the fluids\r\ndisplaced by the same body when floated successively in each.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of distilled water, at the temperature of 62 deg. _F_,\r\nbeing taken as unity, the depth to which the instrument sinks when gently\r\nimmersed in such water is the zero of the scale. The graduations extend\r\nfrom 0 to 40; the latter being the mark which will be level with the\r\nsurface when the instrument is placed in water, the specific gravity of\r\nwhich is 1.040. In recording observations, the last two figures\r\nonly--being the figures on the scale--are written down. Sea-water usually\r\nranges from 1.020 to 1.036.\r\n\r\nA small tin, copper, or glass cylinder is useful for containing the water\r\nto be tested. It should be wider than the hydrometer, and always filled to\r\nthe brim. If fitted to a stand, which is supported by gimbals, it will be\r\nvery convenient. Water in a bucket, basin, or other wide vessel, acquires\r\nmotion at sea, and the eye cannot be brought low enough (on account of the\r\nedges) to read off the scale accurately.\r\n\r\nErrors of observation may occur with the hydrometer, if it be put into\r\nwater without being clean, or without being carefully wiped. The\r\ninstrument is extremely accurate if correctly used. It should be kept free\r\nfrom contact with the sides of the vessel; and all dust, smears, or\r\ngreasiness, should be scrupulously avoided, by carefully wiping it with a\r\nclean cloth before and after use.\r\n\r\nWhenever the temperature of the water tested differs from 62 deg., a\r\ncorrection to the reading is necessary, for the expansion or contraction\r\nof the glass, as well as the water itself, in order to reduce all\r\nobservations to one generally adopted standard.\r\n\r\nNegretti and Zambra's hydrometer, with thermometer in the stem, shows the\r\ndensity and temperature in one instrument.\r\n\r\nFor the following Tables we are indebted to the kindness of Admiral\r\nFitzRoy:--\r\n\r\nTABLE for reducing observations made with a BRASS HYDROMETER, assuming the\r\nlinear expansion of brass to be 0.000009555 for 1 deg.

NEWMAN'S SELF-REGISTERING TIDE-GAUGE.\r\n\r\nAt places where the phenomena of the tides are of much maritime\r\nimportance, a continuous series of observations upon the rise and fall,\r\nand times of change, is essentially necessary as a basis for the\r\nconstruction of good tide tables; and as such observations should also be\r\naccompanied with the registration of atmospheric phenomena, we have no\r\nhesitation in inserting a description of an accurate self-registering\r\ntide-gauge.\r\n\r\nThe tide-gauge, as shown in the illustration, consists of a cylinder, _A_,\r\nwhich is made to revolve on its axis once in twenty-four hours by the\r\naction of the clock, _B_. A chain, to which is attached the float, _D_,\r\npasses over the wheel, _C_, and on the axis of this wheel, _C_ (in about\r\nthe middle of it) is a small toothed wheel, placed so as to be in contact\r\nwith a larger toothed wheel carrying a cylinder, _E_, over which passes\r\nanother smaller chain. This chain, passing along the upper surface of the\r\ncylinder, _A_, and round a second cylinder, _F_, at its further end, is\r\nacted on by a spring so as to be kept in a constant state of tension. In\r\nthe middle of this chain a small tube is fixed for carrying a pencil,\r\nwhich, being gently pressed down by means of a small weight on the top of\r\nit, performs the duty of marking on paper placed round the cylinder the\r\nprogress of the rise or fall of the tide as the cylinder revolves, and as\r\nit is drawn by the chain forward or backward by the rise or fall of the\r\nfloat. The paper is prepared with lines equidistant from each other, to\r\ncorrespond with the hours of the clock, crossed by others showing the\r\nnumber of feet of rise and fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cylinder while in action revolves from left to right to a spectator\r\nfacing the clock, and the pencil is carried horizontally along the top of\r\nthe cylinder; and the large wheel being made to revolve by the rise and\r\nfall of the float, turns the wheel with the small cylinder, _E_,\r\nattached to it. If the tide is _falling_, the small chain is wound round\r\nthe cylinder, _E_, and the pencil is drawn towards the large wheel; but if\r\nthe tide is _rising_, the small chain is wound on to the cylinder, _F_, by\r\nmeans of the spring contained in it, which constantly keeps it in a state\r\nof tension. Thus, by means of the rise and fall of the tide, a lateral\r\nprogress is given to the pencil, while the cylinder is made to revolve on\r\nits axis by the clock, so that a line is traced on the paper showing the\r\nexact state of the tide continuously, without further attention than is\r\nnecessary to change the paper once every day, and to keep the pencil\r\ncarefully pointed; or a metallic pencil may be used, which will require\r\nlittle, if any, attention.\r\n\r\nA good self-registering tide-gauge is a valuable and important acquisition\r\nwherever tidal observations are required, and the only perfectly efficient\r\ninstrument of this kind is that invented by the late Mr. John Newman, of\r\nRegent Street, London. It is now in action in several parts of the world,\r\nsilently and _faithfully_ performing its duty, requiring no other kind of\r\nattention than that of a few minutes daily, and thus admitting the\r\nemployment of the person on any other service whose duty it would\r\notherwise have been to have registered the tide. It has done much by its\r\nfaithful records in contributing to the construction of good tide tables\r\nfor many places; for those unavoidable defects dependent on merely\r\nwatching the surface on a divided scale are set aside by it, all erroneous\r\nconclusions excluded, and a true delineation of Nature's own making is\r\npreserved by it for the theorist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. French barometers are graduated to millimetres. An English inch is\r\nequal to 25.39954 millimetres. Hence, 30 inches on the English barometer\r\nscales correspond to 762 millimetres on the French barometer scales.\r\nConversions from one scale to another can be effected by the following\r\nformulae:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Inches = millimetres divided by         25.39954\r\n  (2) Millimetres = inches multiplied by      25.39954\r\n\r\nOf course, a table of equivalent values should be drawn up and employed,\r\nwhen a large number of observations are to be converted from one scale to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. In Germany, barometers are sometimes graduated with old French inches\r\nand lines,--the vernier generally indicating the tenth of a line.\r\n\r\nOLD FRENCH LINEAL MEASURE.\r\n\r\n                                              English Inches.\r\n  1 douzieme, or point                        =  0.0074\r\n  12 points              = 1 ligne            =  0.0888\r\n  12 lignes              = 1 pouce            =  1.065765\r\n  12 pouces              = 1 pied             = 12.7892\r\n  1 pied                 = 324.7 millimetres.\r\n\r\n\"The Germans indicate inches by putting two accents after the number;\r\nlines, by putting three accents; 27\" 3'''.85, means 27 inches 3 lines 85\r\nhundredths of a line; more frequently, they give the height in lines, and\r\nthe preceding number becomes 327'''.85.\"--_Kaemtz._\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Rule for finding Diameter of Bore of a Barometer Tube._\r\n\r\n\"If the maker has not taken care to measure the interior diameter\r\ndirectly, it may be deduced from the exterior diameter. The exterior\r\ndiameter is first measured by calipers, and, by deducting from this\r\ndiameter 0.1 of an inch for tubes from .3 to .5 of an inch in external\r\ndiameter, we have an approximation to the interior diameter of the\r\ntube.\"--_Kaemtz._\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

The Thermometer contains only Mercury without any admixture of Alcohol\r\nor other fluid.\r\n\r\nII. It has no indices or springs, and its indications are by the column of\r\nMercury only.\r\n\r\nIII. It can be carried in any position, and cannot possibly be put out of\r\norder except by actual breakage of the instrument.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, it will indicate and record the exact temperature at any hour\r\nof the day or night, or the exact temperature at any depth of the sea,\r\nirrespective of either warm or cold currents, or stratum through which the\r\nThermometer may have to pass in its descent or ascent, this last very\r\nspecial quality renders this Thermometer superior for deep-sea\r\ntemperatures to any others; for those now being used in the \"Challenger\"\r\nsounding expedition are liable to give erroneous indications owing to\r\ntheir indices slipping, and otherwise getting deranged--(This was proved\r\nby Messrs. Negretti and Zambra at a Meeting of the British Meteorological\r\nSociety,) and _under certain conditions of temperature_ it is not possible\r\nby the old Thermometers to obtain true temperatures at certain depths\r\nwhich might be required. _Annexed is a copy of a report to the Admiralty\r\nfrom Captain G. S. Nares, of H.M.S. \"Challenger,\" dated Melbourne, March\r\n25th, 1874, which we have taken from NATURE, July 30th, 1874, proving\r\nthe assertion._\r\n\r\n\"In the report to the Admiralty of Capt. G. S. Nares, of H.M.S.\r\n_Challenger_ dated Melbourne, March 25, 1874, Capt. Nares, speaking of the\r\ntemperature of the ocean, especially near the pack edge of the ice,\r\nsays:--'At a short distance from the pack, the surface water rose to 32 deg.,\r\nbut at a depth of 40 fathoms we always found the temperature to be 29 deg.;\r\nthis continued to 300 fathoms, the depth in which most of the icebergs\r\nfloat, after which there is a stratum of slightly warmer water of 33 deg. or\r\n34 deg. As the thermometers had to pass through these two belts of water\r\nbefore reaching the bottom, the indices registered those temperatures, and\r\nit was impossible to obtain the exact temperature of the bottom whilst\r\nnear the ice, but the observations made in lower latitudes show that it is\r\nabout 31 deg. More exact results could not have been obtained even had Mr.\r\nSiemens's apparatus been on board.' It seems to us that the difficulty\r\nmentioned is one which would certainly have been surmounted by Messrs.\r\nNegretti and Zambra's new Recording Thermometers, a description of which\r\nappeared in NATURE, vol. ix. p. 387; this being exactly one of the cases\r\nto which this instrument is peculiarly adapted. We believe the inventors\r\nand makers have greatly improved their Thermometer since our description\r\nappeared, and no doubt means will be taken by the Admiralty to transmit\r\none to the _Challenger_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DEEP-SEA RECORDING THERMOMETER.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be observed that the bulb of the Thermometer\r\nis protected so as to resist the pressure of the ocean, which varies\r\naccording to depth that of three thousand fathoms being something like\r\nthree tons pressure on the square inch. The manner of protecting the bulb\r\nwas invented by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra in 1857, and has been latterly\r\ncopied by other persons and brought out as a new invention. The manner of\r\nprotecting the bulb has been described by the late Admiral R. FitzRoy, in\r\nthe first number of Meteorological Papers, page 55, published July 5th,\r\n1857, as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Referring to the erroneous readings of all thermometers, consequent\r\n    on their delicate bulbs being compressed by the great pressure of the\r\n    ocean, he says:--'With a view to obviate this failing, Messrs.\r\n    Negretti and Zambra undertook to make a case for the weak bulbs, which\r\n    should transmit temperature, but resist pressure. Accordingly a tube\r\n    of thick glass is sealed outside the delicate bulb, between which and\r\n    the casing is a space all round, which is nearly filled with mercury.\r\n    The small space not so filled is a vacuum, into which the mercury can\r\n    be expanded, or forced by heat or mechanical compression, without\r\n    doing injury to or even compressing the inner or much more delicate\r\n    bulb.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of this instrument for deep-sea temperatures is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    In shape it is like a syphon with parallel legs, all in one piece and\r\n    having a continuous communication, as in the annexed figure. The scale\r\n    of the Thermometer is pivoted on a centre and being attached in a\r\n    perpendicular position to a simple apparatus (which will be presently\r\n    described), is lowered to any depth that may be desired. In its\r\n    descent the Thermometer acts as an ordinary instrument, the mercury\r\n    rising or falling according to the temperature of the stratum through\r\n    which it passes; but so soon as the descent ceases, and a reverse\r\n    motion is given to the line, so as to pull the Thermometer towards the\r\n    surface, the instrument turns once on its centre, first bulb\r\n    uppermost, and afterwards bulb downwards. This causes the mercury,\r\n    which was in the left-hand column, first to pass into the dilated\r\n    syphon bend at the top, and thence into the right-hand tube, where it\r\n    remains, indicating on a graduated scale the exact temperature at the\r\n    time it was turned over. The woodcut, Fig. 1, shows the position of\r\n    the mercury _after_ the instrument has been thus turned on its centre.\r\n    A is the bulb; B the outer coating or protecting cylinder; C is the\r\n    space of rarefied air, which is reduced if the outer casing be\r\n    compressed; D is a small glass plug on the principle of Negretti and\r\n    Zambra's Patent Maximum Thermometer, which cuts off, in the moment of\r\n    turning, the mercury in the tube from that of the bulb, thereby\r\n    ensuring that none but the mercury in the tube can be transferred into\r\n    the indicating column; E is an enlargement made in the bend so as to\r\n    enable the mercury to pass quickly from one tube to another in\r\n    revolving; and F is the indicating tube or Thermometer proper. In its\r\n    action, as soon as the Thermometer is put in motion, and immediately\r\n    the tube has acquired a slightly oblique position, the mercury breaks\r\n    off at the point D, runs into the curved and enlarged portion E, and\r\n    eventually falls into the tube F when this tube resumes its original\r\n    perpendicular position.\r\n\r\nThe contrivance for turning the Thermometer over may be described as a\r\nframe with a vertical propeller; to this frame the instrument is pivoted.\r\nOn its descent through the water the propeller is lifted out of gear and\r\nrevolves freely on its axis; but so soon as the instrument is pulled\r\ntowards the surface the propeller falls into gear and revolves in the\r\ncontrary direction, turning the Thermometer over once, and then becoming\r\nlocked and immovable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Directions for adjusting the Thermometer previous to its being lowered in\r\nthe Sea._\r\n\r\n    I. The mercury must all be in the left-hand column.\r\n\r\n    II. The short peg at the back of the thermometer must be in front of\r\n    the stop plate S +; in order to effect this, pull the knob which stops\r\n    the Thermometer, and slightly turn the propeller, to make the\r\n    Thermometer advance sufficiently to escape the stop plate.\r\n\r\nNegretti & Zambra's Patent Atmospheric Recording Thermometer, Fig. 3,\r\ndiffers from the Deep-sea Thermometer by its not having the double or\r\nprotected bulb, it not being required for resisting pressures. In this\r\ncase the instrument is turned over by a simple clock movement, which can\r\nbe set to any hour it may be desirable; the Thermometer is fixed on the\r\nclock, and when the hand arrives at the hour determined upon, and to which\r\nthe clock is set as in setting an alarum clock, a spring is released and\r\nthe Thermometer turns over as before described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Negretti and Zambra have arranged a Wet and Dry Bulb Hygrometer\r\nupon the same plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGRETTI & ZAMBRA'S PRICE LIST OF STANDARD METEOROLOGICAL AND OTHER\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n_The marginal figures in this List and the numbers of the wood engravings\r\nrefer to paragraphs in \"Negretti & Zambra's Treatise on Meteorological\r\nInstruments.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  L  s. d.\r\n\r\n  4 =Standard Barometers=, Fortin's arrangement, as Fig. 3\r\n  with mahogany board                                             8   8  0\r\n\r\n      Ditto    ditto with Millemetre and English scales           9   9  0\r\n\r\n      Ditto    ditto with tube, 0.45 internal diameter and\r\n                     millimetre scale                            10  10  0\r\n\r\n  =Observatory Standard Barometers=, extra large tubes and\r\n  cisterns                                          L25  0  0    35   0  0\r\n\r\n      Ditto    ditto arranged for observations being taken\r\n                     by the Cathetometer                         18  18  0\r\n\r\n  =Cathetometer=, for use with above                             21   0  0\r\n\r\n  9 =Self Compensating Standard Barometer=, Fig. 6               20   0  0\r\n\r\n  10 =Standard Barometer=, with electrical adjustment            15  15  0\r\n\r\n  11 =Pediment Barometers=, Fig 7                    L1  1  0     2   2  0\r\n\r\n     Ditto      ditto     Fig. 8                     L3  3  0     3  10  0\r\n\r\n     Ditto      ditto     Fig. 9                     L4 10  0     5  10  0\r\n\r\n     Ditto      ditto     Fig. 10                                 8  10  0\r\n\r\n     Ditto      ditto     ditto handsome carved mountings,\r\n     in mahogany, oak, or walnut wood    L8  8  0   L10 10  0    12  12  0\r\n\r\n  14 =FitzRoy's Storm or Sea Coast Fishery Barometer=, Fig. 12    5   5  0\r\n\r\n     Ditto    ditto with two verniers                             6   6  0\r\n\r\n     Ditto    ditto mounted in ornamental carved frames, oak,\r\n     walnut, or mahogany                             L6 10  0     8   8  0\r\n\r\n  19 =Marine Barometers=, ordinary forms, Figs. 13 and 14\r\n                                         L2  2s.
